<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts venting about the stresses of Christmas shopping and navigating Manhattan traffic, including a humorous anecdote about Opie's broken side mirror.  This led into their "FU Friday" segment, featuring listener faxes. One fax criticized the lack of Alice in Chains on the station, while another attacked their comments on holiday traffic, resulting in a heated exchange where the listener was insulted with derogatory terms like "retard" and "idiot."

Anthony's disastrous Zoom.com stock investment was a major topic, alongside a listener fax expressing intense dislike for Joe DiMaggio, prompting a discussion of his health and death. A commercial for "Cigars Around the World" interrupted the flow.  A listener fax detailing the contentious divorce of former WNEW employee Dave Herman and his wife Libby dominated a large portion of the broadcast.  Libby Herman herself then joined the show, elaborating on the accusations, including threats and a restraining order filed against her by Dave.  She detailed aspects of their relationship and sex life, and promoted an upcoming garage sale featuring Dave's belongings. Opie and Anthony offered to auction some of the items on air to assist her financially.

Guitarist Gary Hoey appeared in studio.  Despite initial admissions from Opie and Anthony of disliking his music and having destroyed his CDs, Hoey performed a "hardcore Christmas" set, which the hosts ultimately enjoyed.  The discussion then returned to the Dave Herman/Libby Herman situation, interweaving with updates on Joe DiMaggio's health. The show also included the ritualistic destruction of a "Santa's in Jamaica" CD, a discussion of a Starbucks lawsuit, and a news report about a former Musketeer convicted of stock fraud.  The hosts also revealed their own low sales figures for "Opie and Anthony's Demented World" (only 80 units shipped that week).  Several callers rang in expressing interest in dating Libby Herman, including a humorous exchange with a 62-year-old caller who was ultimately rejected. Libby later called back to further detail the items in her garage sale, including Dave Herman's used clothing and other personal effects. The show concluded with the hosts preparing to attend their company Christmas party.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Wow, you're angry. Let's rock and roll and get it out in the open. F Christmas shopping. It sucks.  It does. F driving around Manhattan. Yeah. Oh, people shopping, walking in the middle.  People are darting out in front of cars. Because everyone has lost their mind, Anthony.  Everyone has lost their mind. This stupid holiday season.  You know what it comes down to? It comes down to people coming into Manhattan.  And I think a lot of people are working in the city. You know, people work here. 
[00:00:30]  And they're here to shop. And they step out from behind trucks and buses from in front of them and go right into traffic.  And you've got to jam on the brakes. And then they put that look on their face.  Like you almost hit them. And they don't even look. These are roads, people.  Because they're zombies. Most people are zombies this time of year.  They're just going from store to store. What am I going to get grandma this year? Grandma.  Get out of the road. What am I going to get my wife this year? 
[00:01:00]  And then traffic. Sometimes you become the, now I got a cross in front of you guy.  Because you're in the crosswalk.  Well, Giuliani's got everyone so scared.  Yeah.  That if you do end up in the intersection.  Yeah.  And a little space opens up in front of you.  You've got to take it. Even if you're right in the middle of the crosswalk.  Right. And then people walk on by. Why you mother.  Because you're the guy in the crosswalk.  I'm the guy. I'm the guy in the crosswalk. 
[00:01:30]  I'm the A-hole. Thank you.  Bang on my hood. On the hood of my car.  Yes, I deserve it.  That's me. Oh, I see they're going behind me.  Oh, that's. Oh, no, no.  That key will work great on my trunk.  Go ahead.  Just key it.  No, I didn't need that rear wiper.  That's okay. Thank you.  I didn't need my side view mirror.  Side view mirror.  Which I actually lost in traffic, what, a month ago that happened?  Yeah.  Someone punched Opie's side view mirror.  Why didn't we ever talk about that on the air?  It happened a month ago. 
[00:02:00]  I don't know.  You were being a little aggressive one night.  And I still haven't fixed a damn thing.  Some guy was in the crosswalk when the light turned green.  And he's just taking his sweet ass time.  So Opie gives a little boom on the gas pedal.  I start inching up.  I want to go.  You bumped his hip with your bumper.  That's what you say.  I know you did.  He went like, hey.  And then he, wham, he punched the side view mirror.  He just took it out.  Yeah.  He didn't just punch it.  He took it out.  I thought he shattered the whole side window.  Now he just bashed your mirror. 
[00:02:30]  So then you're sitting there like, all right, do you just count your losses and move on?  Or do you get out of your car, make a scene, hope he doesn't have a gun?  The light was green.  You had to go.  Yeah, I had to go.  So I'm the guy, if you want to know what I drive, I'm the guy driving around with my side view mirror just hanging, flopping over the side.  Flopping, banging into my car because I haven't fixed it in a month.  F him too.  F the world.  Had it.  All right.  Fax line.  Get your FUs in, huh?  212-957-WNEW. 
[00:03:00]  You know, we're getting new listeners on a weekly basis.  So, Anthony, why don't you quickly explain what FU Friday is all about really fast?  Because maybe people just don't get it.  Right.  It's your opportunity out there to vent your anger.  It's Friday.  A lot of anger being piled up in here from this Christmas shopping, work, whatever.  You're pissed off at your boss, your person you're in a relationship with.  This is your forum.  You usually don't have any place to vent your beef.  Yes.  Call us up, fax us, email us, instant feedback, email us, and we will get your complaints on the air. 
[00:03:30]  All right.  A really big FU to you guys and N.E.W. for never playing Alice in Chains.  I listen every day at different times, and I've never heard one song.  Why is that?  They are a great band.  Was that written by me?  I know.  They're our favorite band.  We've played Alice in Chains in the past.  Let me tell you.  And we better start playing a little more, because I think the band fits here at N.E.W.  It's my favorite band, Alice in Chains.  And this guy writes, last time I faxed about this, Anthony whined, we play Alice in Chains. 
[00:04:00]  When did I say that?  I don't know.  This guy has been faxing a lot about that, and you supposedly told him, we do play Alice in Chains.  We do.  Just not a lot.  No.  So.  All right.  I love that band.  I know.  It's obvious.  Okay.  We're ready to rock.  Yeah.  You know, when someone has a legitimate bitch about us, whatever.  Fine.  We read it.  Whatever.  Listen to this guy.  Dopey and Anthony. 
[00:04:30]  You got us.  We've never been called that one before.  Maybe you should wake up and realize you're in New York City.  The traffic and people have been acting the same for the last hundred years here.  I guess it just takes retards longer to get the idea, Frank.  Frank, we're from New York.  I think we know how New York works.  You mean to say that the holiday traffic and people is exactly the same as any other time of the year? 
[00:05:00]  You jerk off.  What are you?  You're the retard.  The idiot.  Go out there today.  Go out there this weekend.  Go to Rockefeller Center.  You tell me it's exactly like it is every other day of the year.  You ass.  Frank.  Here's a guy bitching and he's talking out his ass.  Doesn't know what he's talking about.  Frank, you moron.  Go to Rockefeller Center right now. 
[00:05:30]  Go by the Christmas tree.  Tell me driving there is just like it is during any other time of the year.  What a dopey ass.  There.  That spoke my piece.  I think that pissed me off, that fact.  I think Anthony's going to lose his ass today.  I like that.  Well, when people have legitimate complaints, it's like, oh, geez, we screwed up there.  Okay.  Right.  You got to take it.  And we'll take it.  Yeah.  The other day I said Eli Wallach was dead.  Yeah.  And I caught hell because it was E.G. Marshall. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  All right.  I agree.  I screwed up.  But that one, Frank, Frank, you're an idiot.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, ACDC.  It's a long way to the top.  It's Opie and Anthony on FU Friday.  Music is sounding good.  Everyone is psyched.  The end of the week is upon us.  And we got some high energy going here for you.  So keep the faxes coming in for FU Friday.  212-957-WNEW.  Getting a bunch of sports FUs coming in. 
[00:06:30]  This one's from Chris.  I want to send a huge FU out to the Miami Dolphins and all their fans.  Let's go Jets.  Huge game this weekend for the Jets.  They can get a division title.  Yeah.  If they beat the Dolphins, they're looking very, very good.  Giants playing the Broncos.  What are you thinking?  What are you thinking?  Do you think the Giants are going to be the team to knock off the Broncos?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's definitely going to be the Giants.  You never know.  That's what it's that.  It's that goof factor, though.  Yeah.  But, you know, it would take a big goof factor.  If I was a betting man, I would bet that the Giants will definitely cover the spread this 
[00:07:00]  weekend.  I think it's going to be a very good game.  I'm totally serious.  I know it sounds crazy.  I'll take the bet.  How much do you want to bet?  I don't know.  What's the line on the Giants game?  Anyone have it?  And how much do you want to bet?  I'll bet you right now.  Damn, let's see.  All right.  We'll find it.  Ben's looking it up.  I'll bet you 100.  A Hyundai?  A hundred.  All right.  I'll go for the hundred.  Hundred that the Giants cover the spread?  Yeah.  I want to, like, be real ballsy and say, you know, that they're going to beat them, 
[00:07:30]  but...  Oh, stop.  Now you're just talking like a crazy man.  A hundred and a half.  Twelve and a half.  Twelve and a half.  Twelve and a half.  You know something?  I'll take it.  Yeah.  Okay.  A hundred dollars.  You're going to lose.  A hundred dollars.  Giants will cover the spread.  I've got to make up for my Zoom.com stock I bought.  You're so stupid.  You know, every other internet stock goes through the roof.  I buy Zoom.com.  Yeah.  It's like in the toilet.  I know it is. 
[00:08:00]  What the hell's going on?  You got it at, what, 38?  I'm like the guy that got in on the pyramid scam when it broke up.  Everybody else is like, yeah, man, I just made, like, 20 grand on the pyramid thing.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We're going to meet at this town meeting place and we'll get you a thousand dollars and,  all right, this sounds great.  I'm going to make 20 grand.  Oh, you're writing me a check real quick.  Like a week later.  Oh, did you hear, man?  Yeah, the pyramid, it collapsed.  It did?  All right.  Where's my money? 
[00:08:30]  Oh, no.  You don't get your money.  Oh, no.  No, no.  Vinny's got your money.  Oh, great.  This is good.  It's all over.  Yeah.  Zoom.com.  Internet stock, boy, this is going to go up to 150, 200 a share, I bet you.  It's like Amazon.com and every other, a-hole.com.  Anthony, you haven't answered my question, though.  You bought it at 38, right?  Yeah.  Two days ago?  Yeah.  All right, what is it down to today?  24.  24, Opie. 
[00:09:00]  Way to go.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  I'm, uh, yeah, I'm looking at a tax write-off, I think.  You should have bought the, uh, infinity stock as much as I did.  I did.  Instead of fooling around.  I bought some infinity stock.  You should have took all the money you were, you were, spent on that stock and, and pushed  it into your infinity stock.  That thing is doing quite well.  We're up three points already.  Yeah, I know.  Just rubbing it in, that's all.  It's almost compensating for what I lost on zoom.com.  It's zooming right into the ground is where it's zooming. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, that's too bad.  All right, we got another, uh, F you here.  F Joe DiMaggio.  What?  You heartless bastard.  Who the hell wrote this?  Who's saying that?  A Met fan.  It's signed, a Met fan.  F Joe DiMaggio.  He's sick.  He's better.  He's effing sick again.  He's better.  He's in a coma.  He's not in a coma.  He's sitting up.  He's hitting baseballs.  He's back in a coma.  You know what?  You know what?  I feel bad for Joe. 
[00:10:00]  Why doesn't the old bastard die already?  Oh.  Met fan.  Like everybody else, I feel pretty bad for Joe.  Uh, but think of it this way.  Get him off the damn respirator.  He's probably hovering in that death life phase where one minute he's the old guy wheezing.  He can't breathe.  He's ready to die.  The next minute he's looking at the light and there's Marilyn with a skirt blowing up going,  Joe.  Come here, Joe.  And he's like, what did they pull the plug already? 
[00:10:30]  For God's sake.  Pull the plug.  Joe.  Hurry.  Jack's coming.  Yeah.  And then he's kept alive and he looks at himself.  He looks like the crypt keeper.  Yeah, then he's the old guy again.  Oh, I'm back.  Oh, no.  Come on already.  Just pull the plug.  Marilyn's waiting.  It's not like all of a sudden it's going to be, oh, he's better.  Well, look, the Yankees just signed him again.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, let the guy go with some dignity.  Of course.  It's tragic.  Every news organization has a play-by-play that, oh, the clipper throwing another curve 
[00:11:00]  in the hospital.  That's what the Post said today.  Joe DiMaggio thrown a curveball last night.  It's like rallying in the late innings.  Yeah.  All the doctors have their rally caps on.  That's horrible.  Come on, Jolton Joe.  Let Jolton Joe go, for God's sake.  He's got Marilyn waiting for him.  Yeah, and Marilyn's not going to wait for her too long.  She's got a couple of Kennedys to hang on. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, Joe's not coming.  All right, on the way.  That's horrible.  Oh, my God.  But I was just talking to him.  Some exclusions apply.  Ignore the details.  Huh?  Anthony, cigars around the world.  What?  Huh?  What?  When did he get into broadcasting?  What?  Mike's on, talking over commercials.  Excuse me, you're the button guy.  All right.  You turn it off when I'm talking.  You turn it.  See? 
[00:12:00]  You're a jackass.  All right.  Cigars around the world, Anthony.  The original Cigar of the Month Club.  What are you going to do?  Go out to the mall shopping?  Hmm?  You can do this right from your house.  You got a cigar aficionado in your life?  Give him a subscription to Cigars Around the World.  Yeah, you can totally take care of him, man.  It's really easy.  For only $24.95 per month, plus shipping, Cigars Around the World sends five fresh hand-rolled  cigars, a smoking newsletter, free cigar cutter, gift card, and more.  And they got all sorts of plans, too.  You can get a two- to 12-month membership.  And you can do this by calling 1-800-FRESH-66. 
[00:12:30]  1-800-FRESH-66.  They also have a website.  That's www.cigarsaroundtheworld.com.  Got it?  Got it.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Van Halen, Little Guitars.  It's Opie and Anthony on FU Friday.  She's all worried that I lost all my money on Zoom.com.  No.  I was only using Risk Capital, which to me amounts to about $10.38.  Yeah, everyone is coming down and panicking and hoping you're going to be okay, Anthony. 
[00:13:00]  That's all right.  I'm riding it out.  I'm into Zoom for the long term, Opie.  Yeah, sure you are.  Yeah.  I'm going to come back.  I saw you in the office panicking, trying to figure out how to get out of this one alive.  If you weren't listening a little while ago, Anthony got in on an IPO.  No, no.  I got in after the IPO.  Oh, after the IPO.  Yeah.  That was the problem, right?  Well, the Internet stocks are great.  I mean, they're shooting up over $100.  Mm-hmm.  Except Zoom.com.  So, Anthony gets in two days ago at $38, and it's now $28, two days later. 
[00:13:30]  No, no, no, no.  Let's check the latest thing.  All right.  I think the market's closing.  Let's see how much he lost in a day.  All right.  We're at $26.25.  All right.  He lost 12 points in two days.  Wow.  Yeah, that stock is zooming okay, Anthony.  Oh, well.  That's okay.  Okay.  All life savings, but that's okay.  We'll come back. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  The fax is coming in like crazy.  212-957-WNEW.  It is FU Friday.  Opie and Anthony, I want to say FU to all the Philadelphia Flyers and their stupid fans.  Devils with an awesome comeback last night in their rink.  FU, Lindros.  That's from Jersey Girl.  This one's pretty funny.  FU to my wife for not taking a hint.  I wanted to surprise her for Christmas by getting her a remote starter for her Maximum,  which I pay for. 
[00:14:30]  So I took the car to work to drop off for the installation.  She's been calling all effing day asking when her car will be home and why did I take it.  Oh, by the way, I left my 1996 Explorer at home for her to use.  I'm pissed off.  That's from Steve.  Wow.  And then we got a, I don't even know how we even talk about the other facts we got.  Oh, you got it?  Yeah.  God, I don't know what to do with this.  I don't know whether we should sit on this or, or. 
[00:15:00]  We might have to sit on it for a few minutes.  Check with a couple of people.  No.  That's not our style.  No, I don't think we're going to check with anyone.  We just want to tease it.  We got a, we got a F you from a, uh, a ex-employee's wife.  Look at Roger.  No, he's shaking his head.  No.  He's walking out of the studio.  He doesn't want to be a part of it.  Hey, we had nothing to do with it.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Now we better read it before, uh, before they tell us we can't read it.  This is just, um, it's everybody's forum here.  We open the airwaves to anybody who has a bitch about anything.  Yes.  Okay.  And this girl obviously has a few issues that she wants to sort out.  And why shouldn't we open up the airwaves to her?  Yeah.  I think it would be, uh, bias on our part if we didn't get everybody's, uh, little crank out there.  Well, we sure can't pick and choose at this point. 
[00:16:00]  No.  All right.  Dear Opie and Anthony, I have a big F you shout out for WNEW alumni Dave Herman.  Uh-oh.  I don't know if you're aware of it or not, but we're in the process of getting a divorce.  He was one, he has one placed a restraining order on me because he thought I would spousally abuse him.  Now, these are all Libby's allegations.  Yes.  Two, underhandedly took custody of my two children.  I got them back.  And three, he is not paying child support. 
[00:16:30]  Ah, now these are Libby's allegations.  We are just reading them verbatim from her facts.  I understand if you have, uh, reservations about shouting out this particular F you, not very PC perhaps,  maybe as a public service you can give my garage sale a plug, see a task.  Whatever.  I enjoyed listening to you guys.  Good luck there.  Libby, Libby Herman.  See a task.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  It's another fax that says Dave Herman's sellout sale. 
[00:17:00]  Holy cow.  He's selling his stuff.  Rock and roll radio fans may have heard that radio legend Dave Herman was recently fired from his job as morning man at N.E.W.  Let his loss be your gain.  Oh, no.  This is awful.  This is awful.  In order to make ends meet, I will be having a giant blowout garage sale.  Some items include rock and roll memorabilia, signed items from some of your favorite classic artists, even some of Dave's clothes, including his trademark hats. 
[00:17:30]  It's just ruthless.  Yes, you can own a piece of rock and roll history.  And then it just lists all the items and furniture and all sorts of stuff.  And there's a phone number here.  You got Libby on the line?  Oh, man.  This is just...  Libby!  Hey!  What's going on?  How you doing?  You really want to know?  Yeah.  We got your fax.  Hello?  We did, yeah.  Well, that's what's going on.  Not a happy place over here lately. 
[00:18:00]  What happened?  God, I don't even know where to start.  But what happened?  Well, should I really get into it?  Yeah, go for it.  It started, oh, about three years ago.  No.  This summer, I don't know, you know, people grow apart.  Yeah.  And we're having differences.  Sammy is standing right here, so this is going to be hard to talk to you.  But anyway, we were having some differences that, you know, I didn't think we could fix. 
[00:18:30]  And I just needed a little space.  And I guess that he didn't want to give me space, so he wanted to have me put in an institution or something.  You know?  It was weird.  It was very strange.  Put in an institution?  I'm not kidding.  Listen, I'm not kidding you.  I knew something was wrong when you...  This is a good guy.  I knew something was wrong when your picture disappeared from his desk.  With darts in it?  Did he cut out the eyeballs? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, all of a sudden your picture was gone.  Yeah.  You know, when we first saw the picture of you two, I'm like, oh, look at Dave's daughter.  She's beautiful.  Oh.  No, I'm serious.  You're confusing, I know.  I'm totally serious.  And then I realized, no, that's Dave's wife.  I'm like, wow.  That's his old lady.  That's his old lady.  I mean, what's the age difference?  23 years.  Wow.  But, you know, that's not even the issue, Ryan.  Yeah.  Well, now what's this restraining order?  Well, he thought that I was going to abuse him or something. 
[00:19:30]  He thought I was going to attack him, I guess.  I don't know.  I swear to God, it blew me away.  You ever beat him up?  I don't know.  I'm going to take the fifth on that now.  Did I ever beat him up?  Who's married?  I forget who's married.  Anthony's married.  Now, has your wife ever gotten so P.O.ed at you that she, like, karate chops you or something?  Please say yes.  No, no.  We're not a hitting couple, no. 
[00:20:00]  No, I mean, when he did argument, he was in my face, and I kind of went back.  I did, like, a, you know, one of those.  Well, you could break his hip.  You could do that.  You hit him too hard.  I don't know my own strength.  He'll have to hit his life call pendant.  I have to have power walking and working out, so.  I don't know.  So he's got the restraining order against you?  He did.  And what else is he doing here?  And he, let's see, he, well, I guess in all fairness, I should tell you what I did, too. 
[00:20:30]  Okay.  Um, I locked him out of the house.  You know, so maybe he had reasons to think that I was a little over the top.  Libby, if you tell me you're dating Scott Muni, I'm going to kill myself.  Have you heard?  What?  You know?  God.  So now he's not paying the child support, huh?  Well, when he feels like it.  When he feels like it.  Yeah, it's a lawyer thing, I guess.  You know, my lawyer calls his lawyer.  Yeah.  And then his lawyer doesn't answer the phone.  Wow. 
[00:21:00]  And, you know, like that.  So how was sex with Dave?  Mm, I don't know.  I'm going to put you to sit down.  Uh-oh.  Did he need the Viagra, or was he okay?  What?  What?  I'm just asking.  He had some motion in that ocean still.  Yeah, it wasn't all bad.  It wasn't all good, but, you know.  It was just kind of there?  Yeah.  Well, we worked together for, what, 15 years. 
[00:21:30]  The best periods of my life.  But, um.  So, Libby, are you getting any action now, or?  You know, I'm too involved with garage sales and stuff.  Yeah, is it true you're selling half his stuff?  Well, yeah.  Why not?  Well, he did approve a lot of it.  You know, we have.  How long has he been in the business?  Like, 30 years?  Something like that.  So, we have unbelievable, you know, like, tchotchkes.  Oh, no.  We have, uh.  He's selling tapes.  We've got birth juice, you know, cartons. 
[00:22:00]  We've got, uh.  What don't we have?  We have Devo hats.  We have.  It's like the hunger-thon, only Libby's getting the cash.  Yeah, you know, I'm going through this closet going, holy moly, you know?  Oh, man.  It's been sitting in this closet, and so I think it's time.  We always thought it would be valuable someday.  So, I guess.  Oh, this is brutal.  We have a Smurfs collection that you wouldn't believe.  So, I'm hesitating whether I want to hold on to it or not. 
[00:22:30]  Because, you know, Smurfs will come back someday.  Don't you think?  Oh, yeah.  Of course they will.  Yeah.  Just like his radio career.  He's selling his clothes?  I didn't say that.  You're selling some of his clothes?  Yeah.  You know, some sweatshirts, t-shirts, a nice dinner jacket with Dave Herman's sweats.  This is ugly.  How about this hat?  I have his number one legend hat.  I have a sweaty N.E.W. hat. 
[00:23:00]  I have, what else do I have?  I have Rock and Roll Hall of Fame hat.  He is, you know, he is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  So, this is valuable stuff.  This is a real public service here you're doing.  I'm not kidding.  I'm really doing this.  All right.  So, if there's some Dave Herman fans out there and they want to own a piece of Dave, what should they do?  They should call this number.  All right.  Do I really want to give this out?  Yeah!  Okay.  It's 568, oh, 201-568-7493. 
[00:23:30]  7493.  Yeah.  And give me a day because I will put together some fax directions and if they're serious they can come out.  It's on the 19th of December.  It's a Saturday.  Okay.  From 10 to 4.  All right.  And Sunday from 10 to 2.  And Dave might make an appearance that day.  So.  You two going to box?  No, I'm talking to you.  I'm talking to me here. 
[00:24:00]  You two going to have a fist fight?  Maybe, you know.  It could be interesting.  No.  All right.  Wow.  I always thought it was true love between you two.  Oh, yeah.  Well, there's a thin, wavy line between love and hate.  I never thought it was the older guy after the attractive young chick.  No one did.  But, wow.  Wow.  So, you're looking forward to dating again?  You know, I'm a little rusty.  Yeah?  I really am.  But, actually, I do have a date Saturday night.  I'm proud to say that.  Oh, you do.  Congratulations.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. 
[00:24:30]  I was going to set you up with one of our listeners.  Yeah.  Oh, well, maybe, uh...  Do you want to do that?  I'm afraid.  That's been very, for 13 years.  It is a little Howard Stern-ish.  But, I mean, how can we pass this up?  Do you want to come in and we'll get you a date?  You know, let me do a test run here Saturday night to see if I can remember how to do it.  I mean, I'll admit, this is a blatant, stern rip-off, but it's too good.  This is too good.  All right, Libby. 
[00:25:00]  All right.  Well, please keep in touch and let us know what's going on.  I will.  All right.  Okay.  There she is, Libby Herman.  Thanks, guys.  What are you...  Are you using your maiden name again?  I'm debating.  See, these are the things that are hanging me up.  Is it Libby Herman?  Is it Libby Park?  I don't know.  We'll call you Libby Park.  Okay, good.  All right, Libby.  All right.  Talk to you later.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Wow.  Hello.  Well, there's a heavy little scene.  My goodness.  Do we got the number if someone wants to own a piece of Dave Herman? 
[00:25:30]  We got it, right?  How could you be party to that?  What?  She's trying to raise some money, maybe to raise her kids.  I understand, but we don't have both sides of the story, Opie.  That's true.  I mean, I think if Libby's still listening...  Yeah.  Maybe we could auction some of the stuff off on our show.  That'd be huge.  We'd raise a ton of money.  Screw our, you know, feels for meals.  Well, no, we better do feels for meals.  Yeah.  All right.  I wonder if Libby...  Yeah.  All right, Anthony, we need to take a moment here and talk about Take Paws. 
[00:26:00]  We've been talking about this all week.  It's a great gift to give to someone this holiday season.  Yes, it is.  They're cute little animals.  Lions, tigers, leopards.  And, boy, girls love these things, man.  Mm-hmm.  You give them to your sweetie.  You'll look like the sensitive guy.  What are you going to get her, a blender?  You're going to get her a toaster oven?  No one gives their wife a blender for Christmas.  Some guys do.  They don't know.  They don't know that it makes you look like a jerk.  All right.  Well, these first Take Paws pets are limited, numbered, and not available in stores. 
[00:26:30]  And just like Beanie Babies and Hummels and other collectibles, the first generation is  usually the most valuable.  They're very lifelike.  The eyes are very cool on these things.  If you want, you can enter to win a free Take Paws leopard, tiger, or lion.  All you have to do is go to the WNEW website, WNEW.com, and enter to win.  Also, from that point, you could go to the Take Paws website to check out what they're all about.  All right?  You could look them over.  So if you're online right now, you know, enter to win the lion, the tiger, or the leopard. 
[00:27:00]  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  www.wnew.com, or you could give Take Paws a call.  Their number is toll-free, 1-800-682-2266.  That number, once again, 1-800-682-2266.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony, Leonard Skinner, Johnny Lang before that, and still raining.  It's Opie and Anthony on F.U. Friday, that is.  And lots and lots is going on. 
[00:27:30]  F.U. Friday got a little real today, I do believe.  Uh, yeah.  Lawyers are calling.  They want copies of our show now.  It's just a mess.  Just a mess.  Why did she have to fax us?  No.  We had nothing to do with that.  I liked hearing from her.  I did.  You don't know what's going on.  Dave Herman's ex-wife isn't official, or they...  I think they're in the middle of it.  They're in the middle of a divorce.  And she called up.  And she, uh, she faxed in a F.U. about Dave Herman. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  And then, um, we got her on the phone and we found out that it's a little ugly.  Yeah.  Because the two of them, and she's going to sell all his stuff.  She's having a yard sale.  A yard sale.  Memorabilia.  Dave Herman's memorabilia.  Yeah.  Libby's, uh, going out in the yard with his stuff.  Crazy Libby.  Everything must go.  Hats.  Boots.  Pants.  Awards.  Gold records. 
[00:28:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, divorce is never pretty.  No.  And, um...  But I don't feel like testifying.  You know.  What happened?  Can we just give them the tape and let them fight it out?  Yeah.  Man, I can't believe how real that was, though.  It's how it is.  She had a lot of gripes.  She's saying that he's not paying child support or pays when he feels like it.  That's...  Those are her allegations, Opie.  We haven't heard from Dave, so we don't know his side of this whole thing. 
[00:29:00]  Well, I don't know if we will, but we open up the airwaves to him, too.  Yes.  If he wants to respond to what she has said, it's only fair.  Libby's thinking of, you know, getting a few of Dave's items together, and we're going  to auction them off on our show.  That's what she said.  Yeah.  So, we'll have to wait and see on that.  Well, someone else in a messy little case today, Opie, Bill Clinton, is profoundly sorry.  And moments after, he appeared in the Rose Garden of the White House to say he is profoundly 
[00:29:30]  sorry for all I've done wrong in words and deeds.  I have sinned against ye.  The House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to recommend that he be impeached  for committing perjury before a grand jury.  Wow.  So, now where do we go from here?  Well, that's not really a surprise.  Everybody figured that would happen.  Mm-hmm.  Now, I'm not sure what happens.  Well, now they're on TV debating it.  Yeah.  And when did John Goodman get involved with the proceedings?  Who is that guy?  I didn't know...  Is he his big, fat head?  I didn't know he was a congressman, John Goodman. 
[00:30:00]  I thought I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit and all of a sudden it's like, what's  John Goodman doing there?  This guy looks just like him.  He does.  He's got a big, fat head.  So, now they're debating the issue?  Yeah.  But I don't know.  They voted.  I don't know what they're debating.  Well, they're in the middle of a debate because Barney Frank was on the tube.  Barney Frank.  Hi, I don't think Bill Clinton did anything wrong.  Oh, dear.  Oh, my. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  Where's my gerbil?  Scary.  All right.  Another F.U. coming in here, Anthony.  Gentlemen, would you kindly send out a spirited F.U. to my soon-to-be ex-wife of 17 years?  To her mother and, most of all, to her low-life attorney, they should all choke to death under  the Christmas tree while opening presents.  Thanks.  Happy holidays.  Richie from Staten Island.  Oh, I thought it was Dave Herman.  No, no, no. 
[00:31:00]  Keep your F.U.'s coming in.  212-957-WNEW.  Yay!  1027-WNEW, the rock of New York with the cult love removal machine.  It's Opie and Anthony for F.U. Friday.  What's up, man?  And look who's in the studio.  It's Gary Howey.  As Roger, our promotions guy, pronounces it.  Where is Roger?  Because Roger's supposed to intro Gary Howey today.  To give my name the official sound, Gary Howey. 
[00:31:30]  Howey, he does.  He just has a really strange accent.  Have you listened to How How Howey?  That's what he says.  He's from, where is he from?  He's from Jersey, but he moved down south.  And got this accent that nobody should have.  No one should have this.  Is he coming in?  Is he here?  Roger?  Yeah, you gotta go find Roger, because Roger's got an intro, Gary Howey.  Gary, we gotta be honest.  We didn't know who you are when we first heard you were coming on our show.  That's okay, man.  Our promotions guy said, we have Gary Howey coming on your show. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  And we're like...  Gary Howey?  Howey?  Yeah, Howey.  Howey?  Well, I remember Hocus Pocus and stuff.  Sure, yeah.  Did a remake of that.  But honestly, Anthony and I sat there and said, what the hell are we gonna do with Gary Howey?  Do with Gary Howey?  And we were pissed.  We'll be honest.  We didn't know.  We were ticked off.  We were frustrated.  We had a copy of your CD.  Yep.  And tragically, something happened to it, and we weren't even able to listen to it.  No problem.  Well, I brought my guitar.  Wow. 
[00:32:30]  So I got that in hand.  All right.  So we'll have some live, howdy.  And I'm glad that you gave us more copies of your Christmas CDs, because we did lose the ones they said.  Well, I brought those for you guys, and I really want to say it's an honor to be on this station with you guys.  I really mean that.  I really mean that.  It's an honor.  I mean, I'm a great fan.  I'm from Boston.  I'm a Boston boy, East Coast, and I was watching the Legends thing on VH1 with Springsteen.  Last night in the hotel, and they kept showing interviews with him, and it was from WNW.  WNW.  Wasn't that cool?  So I was really psyched.  Very cool.  I was really psyched. 
[00:33:00]  So thanks for having me, man.  All right.  We can't really trash anymore then.  Oh, no.  Well, I do dig you guys.  I'll be honest, though.  Thanks for having me.  We did smash your seats.  Yeah.  We were so pissed.  We were just having a bad day.  I think it was like our time of the month or something.  And it's like anybody that we don't know are going to come on the show.  Yep.  We don't know how to, you know, it's like, who is this?  Right.  What the hell are they throwing on me now?  Right.  And we don't know if it's going to be some guy, you know, like Slim Whitman going to  come in and yodel for us.  Dude, I understand, man.  I mean, or this guy, dogs.  This guy sent us Santa's in Jamaica, and it's just... 
[00:33:30]  That's what happens again to another one of his CDs.  That's the fifth CD of dogs that we've smashed.  Did mine break that easy?  He keeps sending them.  I'm going to send you guys, like, stuff in metal from now on.  It's a steal.  So you'll just smash it and smash.  Gary, we've smashed your CD just like Anthony's smashed the dogs that you did.  That's all right.  We've got to tell it like it is.  Dude, you guys are real, man.  Hey, I've trashed hotel rooms.  You know, I've done it.  But now I heard you warming up, and it sounds like you truly do rock. 
[00:34:00]  Thanks, man.  Thanks.  I love to rock.  I've been playing guitar for 23 years.  I mean, I'm an instrumental guitar player.  It's like a salmon swimming upstream, man.  It's always a battle.  Yeah.  You know, so I like to rock.  All right.  Let's check out a song.  You're going to do a Christmas song, right?  Yeah.  I put out a...  Well, the name, like, Hoey.  I put out a CD called Ho, Ho, Hoey.  And it's just basically rock versions of all the Christmas classics.  And I did it for a laugh in my basement.  My mom said, you should make a nice Christmas record.  And that was, you know, it was just a goof.  Okay.  So let's check out Gary Hoey. 
[00:34:30]  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  Ready?  Wow.  Wow.  Hey, man.  Thanks, bro.  Thanks, man.  Who is this guitar god, Gary Hoey?  He has truly been sent to us from the heavens.  I feel like I'm in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We'll give it to you, man.  That's sick.  That kicked ass, I would say.  Thanks, bro. 
[00:35:00]  It's not your grandfather's Christmas song.  I'll tell you that much.  Not for the Bing fans, man.  No.  Yeah, like Bing and...  Well, who did he do his little duet with?  Oh, who knows?  That Christmas one?  David Bowie.  David Bowie, man.  Yeah.  Maybe you could play with some old fart.  That'd be cool.  I did a gig once when Mel Torme was on the gig.  Did you?  And Bob Hope, man.  Oh.  Yeah, Bob Hope.  Bob Hope.  Hey, that was great.  That's some guitar playing. 
[00:35:30]  Too bad I couldn't see you.  My eyes are bleeding.  That was it.  You were there, man.  Wow.  Okay.  All right.  You want to stick around and do another one?  I would love to, man.  Okay.  We're hanging with Gary Hoey.  His CDs are called Ho Ho Hoey 1.  Ho Ho Hoey 1.  And Ho Ho Hoey 2.  2.  Back for revenge.  In stores now, and he's got a website.  Everyone has a website these days.  You've got to, man.  Or with Gary Hoey in just a bit.  What song are you going to do next, Gary?  I was thinking of doing You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch.  Oh, I'd like to hear that. 
[00:36:00]  Cool.  The Rock of New York, 102.7 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony on FU Friday.  Uriah Heep, Easy Living.  We haven't played that song in a long time, huh?  Wow.  It made me want to roll up a doobie.  You digging that song, Gary?  I was digging it, bro.  Big time.  All right.  We're hanging with Gary Hoey.  If you're just tuning in, we made peace with Mr. Hoey.  Yeah.  After you smashed my CDs.  We did smash your CD last week.  That's all right.  I just...  I brought you new ones.  I know.  And honestly, I'm going to bring these home and I'm going to play them. 
[00:36:30]  Thanks, brother.  Because I'm sick of my Bing Crosby Christmas album.  Those are made of airplane metal, man.  You'll never break them.  You can't break those?  Good.  Unbreakable.  But, whoa, he's ready to rock again.  Can you do like the Bill and Ted thing?  I don't know.  I don't know what that would be.  Let's try it.  Yeah.  That's what it sounded like when he was playing before.  Well, you got a couple CDs out. 
[00:37:00]  Ho, ho, hoey one and ho, ho, hoey two.  Where's Roger?  He's supposed to be saying this.  I know.  But it's funny actually.  They're in stores now and you got a website.  W-W-W dot hoey H-O-E-Y dot net.  But we're ready to hear another Christmas song.  Wait.  Here's Roger.  Okay.  Roger's got an intro because he's got the wacky accent.  Let's do it, man.  All right, Roger's walking right behind you.  Look at this guy.  He's a clown.  Hey, Roger.  Hey, Roger.  All right, Roger.  First of all, you got to explain where you're from, Jersey.  Grab a mic over here.  You're originally from Jersey. 
[00:37:30]  Correct.  And then you moved to?  Atlanta.  Atlanta.  So anybody raising children in Jersey never moved down south or your kid will sound like this.  Yeah, from Georgia.  All right.  We need a little warm-up.  Say the Goo Goo Dolls.  The Goo Goo Dolls?  See what I put up?  You know, I come to a station and the abuse I take is incredible.  And repeat after me.  I'm getting you guys a limo.  I'm getting you guys a limo.  This is how he talks.  We're not making him talk this way.  Okay.  He's great. 
[00:38:00]  Without further ado, why don't you intro Gary Hoey?  He's going to do another Christmas song for us, Roger.  And on WNEW, we'd like to welcome Gary Hoey.  All right.  Yeah.  Thanks, Roger.  You're welcome, man.  Thanks, man.  It's like Christmas with Satan.  Yeah.  Whoa. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Rock.  Waking up.  Waking up the wangiers, man.  Let's go smoke some dough, man.  What else do you say?  That's great.  That is really good, Gary.  Gary Hoey in the studio doing something a little different today.  The Grinch song.  That was on last night.  Was it?  Yeah.  Did you watch it?  Yeah.  It was good.  I've seen it, what, 30 times now?  You know?  For some reason, they don't hold up with age, those things.  When you're a kid, you know, you look forward to seeing them and you watch them now.  It's like, hmm. 
[00:39:00]  Well, they're too short.  I know.  If you buy the video without the commercials, it's like 12 minutes.  Yeah.  It's like Frosty the Snowman and stuff.  Yeah.  Those are like seven minutes long now.  I remember watching Rudolph as a kid and it seemed like a long, scary thing.  Yeah.  Very scary.  I want to be a dentist.  Yeah.  But that's because it came on at 6.30 and bedtime was seven.  Yeah.  It seemed like a long, long period of time.  Wow.  I'm exhausted.  It's like a quarter to seven now. 
[00:39:30]  Betty bye.  Oof.  Getting late.  Tuck me in.  Snug as a bug in the rug.  All right.  You got one more in you, you think?  Yeah, man.  Hi, everybody.  This is Soupy Sales.  Wishing all you wonderful WNEW FM listeners a very Merry Christmas and a great Happy New Year.  I found a bunch of these Christmas things here from when the station ate moose.  Soupy Sales.  Soupy Sales.  Hi, this is Soupy Sales. 
[00:40:00]  I'm a dick.  Hey, Gary, I'm going to give you the honor of smashing the Soupy Sales Christmas.  Yeah, I did.  Oh, thanks.  Considering we smashed your CD last week.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Just wail it anywhere.  That was the last time you'll hear it.  Wow.  That's great.  No, do a job on it.  There you go.  Oh.  Got to throw it against the wall or something.  Come on.  There it is.  There it is.  Thank you.  All right.  There you go.  There you go.  All right.  Wow.  Rick, I'll give you the raise.  Take it easy, bro.  Yeah, a little aggression there. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, my road manager is going nuts on you here.  All right.  We got another Christmas song from Gary Hoey on the way.  This is Dire Straits on the Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  It's Opie and Anthony and our new pal Gary Hoey.  Believe it or not, we now like the man an awful lot.  After trashing him relentlessly last week when we heard he was going to be on the show,  I have to admit, we were wrong, Gary.  Hey, man, you know what? 
[00:41:00]  Any exposure is good exposure, man.  You're getting trashed.  It went as far as Anthony and I asking to have today off so we didn't have to deal with you.  Well, I'm glad it wasn't that difficult for you.  Well, I'm just trying to, now that we know each other a little better, I'm just letting  you know what happened last week.  It's a learning experience.  We smacked the D.  We yelled at the boss, told him we weren't coming in today.  Hey, you know, I've had things where people have called me up and said, dude, you got  to go do...  All right.  There we go.  We just dumped out of it.  It's okay. 
[00:41:30]  I think I got it in time.  He cursed.  Sorry, man.  That's all right.  That's how it is in here.  We're loose, man.  You know, you feel like you're just talking and you throw the S word around.  Well, I'm sorry.  You let me break things so I figured I could start swearing and smoking pot and, you know.  Smoking pot.  I mean, you know.  Hey, can we get a DiMaggio update here?  Yes.  What is the DiMaggio update?  Well, last we heard, when last we left Joe, he was near death's door.  Yes.  That's pretty much it.  Yes.  Joe DiMaggio has awakened from his coma.  Uh, the doctors are saying, you won't believe it, but he's awake, moving his head and grabbing 
[00:42:00]  my hand.  It's completely unexpected.  The coma that was present deeply this morning is just not there now.  Jolton Joe is just, he's in a rundown.  Yeah, with life and death.  Life and death.  Where is he going?  It's like a, it's like a plot for a wacky sitcom or something. 
[00:42:30]  So now he's doing okay.  Yeah.  It changes by the hour with, uh, Jolton Joe.  Portrait of a desperate bullpen.  Yeah.  Well, we wish him the best.  I don't know.  They're putting odds on him now.  Yeah.  It still doesn't look good.  On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the best outlook, Barron said, this is the doctor,  DiMaggio was a 0.5 early this morning and had improved to a one by this afternoon. 
[00:43:00]  It's still a very dire situation.  The whole thing could change in 15 minutes.  Unbelievable.  All right.  Oh, poor Joe.  Instead of winds doing traffic on the tens, we could do the Joe DiMaggio updates.  Joe DiMaggio and weather on the ones.  All right.  Also, there's a bunch of people calling and faxing and emailing, uh, asking us if that  whole, uh, Dave Herman's ex-wife thing was for real.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  There's, it's real.  There's, we don't do fake things on this show.  They can't believe we actually talked to Dave Herman's ex-wife because I guess they're getting  divorced.  Yeah.  And we were reading our FUs, you know, they pile up because it is FU Friday and we're  going through the faxes and we're reading them.  And all of a sudden there's one from, uh, Libby Herman.  And we had gotten faxes from Libby before.  Um, nothing indicating that there was a problem in hers and Dave's marriage.  She's been a huge fan of our show since day one, by the way.  Yeah.  And then today we get this.  Where is that fax?  Because she has a lot of complaints on there. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, the lawyers took it?  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Let us have it back.  I'll get it.  I'll get it.  Jeez.  But she's, she's selling a bunch of his stuff.  Memorabilia.  Well, supposedly, uh, Libby, this is like a soap opera.  There goes the hotline.  Uh-oh.  Wonder who that could be.  Hey Rick, uh, check the hotline.  Yeah, check that hotline.  That might be some...  We might get a rebuttal.  We might have to talk to.  Uh, I guess Libby, uh, locked Dave out of, out of the house.  Yeah.  Dave only pays child support when he feels like it.  This is all Libby talking.  According to Libby. 
[00:44:30]  And, uh, Dave wanted Libby, uh, institutionalized at one point.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, then she took the kids away.  Yeah.  I mean, he took, he took the kids away, but now she's got them back.  Yeah, there's the complaints right there.  Um, blah, blah, blah.  Okay.  And then she goes on to say, uh, maybe as a public service, you could give my garage sale a plug.  And it says, see attached.  And it's a list of all the stuff that she's selling of Dave Herman's.  So everyone's been calling saying, is this true?  Because I really want a piece of Dave. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  It's, it's true.  People, Dave's a celebrity.  Yeah.  And, and, and people want some of this memorabilia, I guess.  And at this point, I guess Libby needs money to raise her kids.  Right.  So now Rick is telling me that she has changed her answer machine.  And now she's giving out, uh, directions to her garage sale.  Yep.  So we're dialing up the number.  Let's see what that's all about.  Can we give out the number for the garage sale again?  She should do okay.  What, what number is it?  That's the same number that I'm calling? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  All right.  That number right there.  You can get all the, um, okay.  Two, oh, two, oh, one, five, six, eight, seven, four, nine, three.  If you want, uh, some items from Libby Herman's garage sale.  I wonder if, uh, she's selling that, that big long leather coat and hat he wore in the  NEW commercials back in the eighties where he looked like Indiana Jones.  That would be worth something.  Wow.  I'd, I'd, I'd buy that.  I might put a bid in for that.  Hello?  Libby.  Yeah.  Oh, we were trying to get your answer machine. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, hi, oh, sorry.  You didn't get in trouble, did you?  No.  I, I, I, I'll be.  Yeah.  I don't care.  No.  You know, in fact, I was thinking I'm going through some boxes downstairs.  Yeah.  This really should be, uh, an auction, some of this stuff.  Maybe I should come up and you could do some digital pictures or something, put them on  the website.  That's a good idea.  We're thinking of maybe having you come up with a box of this stuff and we'll, uh, we'll auction  it off on the air and give you all the money for your children.  You know, Libby's kids.  Why not?  Libby's kids. 
[00:46:30]  What do we, what do we got?  They're a little retarded too, I must say.  You know?  What kind of stuff you got that you want to auction off?  You know what?  Let me go downstairs.  I have, I have Stone Pony t-shirts.  I have Bruce Springsteen t-shirts.  I have, uh, something a listener made me, a born in the USA crochet, you know, bippy  top.  I have, uh, you know, Billy Joel t-shirts.  I have all the old NEW baseball t-shirts, you know, the jerseys. 
[00:47:00]  I have foreigner, uh, you know, members only jackets.  Members only jackets.  And you're willing to sell all this stuff.  I, I, I'm willing to part with it.  We're practically giving away.  It's crazy Libby.  I am, I really am.  It's insane what we have down there.  It's really nuts.  Wow, you've had it, huh?  I have had it.  You can say that, yeah.  I have, you know.  Well, we're still looking.  Baby needs a new pair of shoes.  I hear ya.  All right. 
[00:47:30]  Hey, who are you going out with Saturday, by the way?  I'm going out with a very sane guy.  Yeah?  Which is very unlike me.  Uh, you know, he called twice.  The first time he called, I was comatose, sleeping, drool coming out of my mouth.  You know, I hit it.  And then he had the nerve to call back again.  And I was asleep.  And so he called back again, you know, perseverance.  And, uh, he's just very sweet.  He's a friend of mine's cousin.  All right.  Long Island.  Now.  And, uh, we're going to see the Nutcracker. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, cute.  A real datey date.  Now, what are the chances you might give him some this weekend?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  You know, it's a situation where he has children.  He's going through a divorce.  He, uh, is very brave to, uh, you know, go out with me.  Yeah.  So, uh, we just decided that we will, we are calling it a date.  It is an official date.  Right on.  Yeah.  You should do it on a Tuesday so you can become a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Ah.  Yeah, I love that.  I love that.  It's a good feature, you know. 
[00:48:30]  Putting people together in the world.  I love that.  All right, Libby.  All right.  Well, go downstairs and get some of this stuff.  And we'll, we'll talk about some of the stuff up for auction.  Okay.  All right?  All right.  All right, Libby.  See you.  Bye.  Bye.  Join us next time for The Hermans.  It's like a soap.  There you have it.  In case you, uh, thought we were making the whole thing up.  Gary Hoey's still here with his guitar wondering, hey man, when am I going to get to play?  No, this is fun, man.  I'm enjoying myself.  You're in shock like everyone else right now.  Pretty, pretty much, man. 
[00:49:00]  Okay.  All right.  So you got the two CDs out, Ho, Ho, Hoey 1 and Ho, Ho, Hoey 2 in stores now.  You got the website, www.hoey, H-O-E-Y.net.  And you're going to do another one for us.  Absolutely.  What are you going to do?  I thought we'd do a little version of, uh, God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.  It's a nice tender Christmas ballad that's been known to raise the dead.  All right, cool.  So, should we do it?  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Smash it! 
[00:49:30]  Smash it!  Smash the guitar!  Smash it!  Yeah!  Right on, Gary.  Oh, yeah.  Damn, you rock.  You do rock.  Gary Hoey, everyone.  I feel like a buffoon for, uh, ragging him last week.  You feel like complete a-holes, Gary.  I thought he was going to come in.  I thought, you know, all right, Gary Hoey, he does Christmas songs on guitar.  I picked you some kumbaya jack-off coming in here.  Okay, we're going to play some Christmas songs. 
[00:50:00]  And then you come in here and play the devil's, uh, rock version of Christmas.  I love it.  It's hardcore Christmas.  Hardcore Christmas.  Uh, well, thanks for having me, guys.  This has been so much fun, man.  Cool.  Well, you got a couple CDs out, Ho Ho Hoey 1 and Ho Ho Hoey 2, in stores now.  Absolutely.  Anything else you want to say, Gary?  No, man.  I just want to wish everybody in New York a safe, happy holiday.  And, uh, just say I was really, really psyched to come in and see you guys today.  I mean that.  And I don't even care that you trashed me for a few days. 
[00:50:30]  You know, I understand, man.  You guys, you know, you're doing your job, you know?  At least we were open-minded to, you know, have you come in and go through the process and see what happens.  So, I have no hard feelings, brother.  And look how you've redeemed yourself like that.  Well, you know, like I said, I'm like a salmon swimming upstream, man.  You know, I, I, this isn't the first time I've been, you know, people have been sort of leery of what I do.  You know, you just got to do what you do, man.  You know, and just hopefully people will dig in.  If they don't, you just keep doing it.  Well, we can relate to that because that's exactly what happens with me and Anthony on a daily basis trying to do this radio show. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, what are we doing being so prejudiced?  Yeah.  We hope people like what we do, so.  Well, I like what you guys do.  All right, Gary, thanks a lot for stopping by.  My pleasure.  Happy holidays, man.  Right on.  Wow, Anthony, a lot of people asking about the grandma got run over by a reindeer song that they just heard.  Yeah, my brother Joe did that one.  And it's available on Opie and Anthony's Demented World.  Oh, just available in every record store across the country.  Yeah.  It's on Dickhead Records and Tapes, our record company. 
[00:51:30]  Well, be nice.  Our record company called us today, Anthony.  Yeah.  And he had some good news for us.  Yeah, great.  We shipped 80 units this week.  That's what he said.  So, ooh, that ought to just saturate the New York market there, boy, let me tell you.  80 units.  Woo!  Woo!  Wow.  That could take care of one back alley alone.  80 units.  80 units.  Shouldn't there be a few zeros behind that?  Right.  80?  80.  What, 80 large you're talking?  What? 
[00:52:00]  No, 80.  It should be, we just shipped 80,000.  80.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, that was just some mustard.  I meant eight.  As I look here at the sheet, that's not 80.  So, good luck while you're shopping this weekend.  Makes a great Christmas gift.  Yeah, trying to find our Opie and Anthony Dementor World CD.  Good luck.  They shipped 80 this week.  So, the odds are greatly increased that you can find one.  Jesus, son of God.  Jeez, I bet that nearly doubles the amount that's in New York now.  What the hell happened to us?  We used to be somebody. 
[00:52:30]  I sound like dice now.  I know.  We're heading that way fast.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York, Stone Temple Pilots, and Creep ZZ Top.  Before that, it's Opie and Anthony.  Another wacky Friday show.  In progress.  Man.  Still have a lot to get to before we get out of here.  It's getting a little weird.  Yes.  A little surreal.  Anthony, I think it's time for the hourly smash of Santa's in Jamaica. 
[00:53:00]  You want to explain what this is all about?  Well, Dukes, as they call them, sent us Santa's in Jamaica.  The Dukester.  A million copies of it.  And we've been smashing them hourly.  Yeah.  We tried playing it, but found its entertainment value to rank somewhere around Joe DiMaggio's longevity.  From today on.  Yeah.  And we're smashing them every hour. 
[00:53:30]  Yes.  This thing is not much better than a Kajigugu record, so.  All right.  Let's put our safety goggles on.  Do I get to break this one?  Yeah.  You could break that one.  Okay.  All right.  Be careful.  By the way, this is the sixth copy of Santa's in Jamaica CD that we're breaking.  Yeah.  And the guy called us up.  I guess he plays shortstop for the NAW softball team.  Yeah.  Not no mo'.  But he said that this is like the hottest Christmas song in Jamaica or something.  In Jamaica?  Really?  Yeah.  Well, it's not doing much in the States. 
[00:54:00]  Okay.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here's Santa's in Jamaica.  Let's play through this one.  Let her rip.  Let's track through it.  Oh!  Oh, wait a minute.  What happened?  It got away from you?  Yeah, that was before, man.  No, give it another one.  I will.  Hold on.  Give it.  It's coming apart.  Oh, wow.  Boy, that blew it up real good.  Okay.  Keep sending those CDs in, please.  Wow.  We need more CDs to smash.  Track through that. 
[00:54:30]  Anthony, as I get the pieces of CD out of my eye, explain the Libby Herman thing real  fast, because we got five guys on hold that want to date Dave Herman's wife.  Well, this has just taken on a life of its own.  Libby Herman, Dave's wife.  You might remember Dave Herman was the morning guy here for many years at NW Radio.  It's FU Friday today.  And she faxed in an FU to Dave.  And I don't think anyone really knew this, but they were having a lot of problems, I 
[00:55:00]  guess, in their marriage.  And they're getting a divorce.  Yeah.  So she faxed in a big FU.  You want to read a couple of things off of the FU?  Yeah, the lawyers gave the fax back, so I guess we can read it again.  All right.  Dear Opie and Anthony, I have a big FU shout out for NW alumni Dave Herman.  I don't know if you're aware of it or not, but we're in the process of getting a divorce.  He has placed a restraining order on me because he thought I would spousily abuse him.  He underhandedly took custody of my two children. 
[00:55:30]  I got them back.  He is not paying child support.  I understand if you have reservations about shouting out this particular FU, not very PC  perhaps, maybe as a public service, you can give my garage sale a plug.  See, attached.  Now, we've got to say that these are all Libby's allegations.  Yeah.  That we haven't heard from Dave or his side of it, but this is what Libby's saying, and  we open up the airwaves to Dave if he wants to respond.  Correct.  And Libby wants us to give out her number for the garage sale. 
[00:56:00]  She's actually taking his stuff, because I guess she locked him out of the house for a  while.  Yeah, she's got a bunch of memorabilia from NW, Rock and Roll, Dave Herman, The Morning Show,  and she's selling it.  You could own a piece of Dave Herman, is what this comes down to.  So, the number is 201-568-7493.  She's serious.  I guess she needs the money to raise her kids at this point.  Right.  And we're trying to give you a piece of Dave Herman by giving away his wife.  Now, you know, I'll be the first one to say, growing up in New York and being a huge 
[00:56:30]  Howard Stern fan, this is blatant Howard Stern.  Yeah, we'll admit it.  I'll be the first to admit it.  This has shades of DiBella written all over it.  But it's just too good to pass up.  Yeah, yeah, you're right.  For God's sake.  You want to talk to one of these guys?  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  Yes.  I hear you want to go out with Libby Herman.  I think that she sounds like a pretty together lady.  All right.  What could you offer her?  I could offer, oh, Lord, a good cup of coffee, a lot of conversation. 
[00:57:00]  Wait a minute.  What do you do for a living?  I'm retired.  You're retired?  Retired college professor.  How old are you?  I'm 62.  No, no.  That's how old Dave Herman was.  I think she wants some young, supple meat at this point.  She's a young girl.  Well, my friends say I look like 48.  Let her make her own mind.  How old is she?  She's like a young girl.  She's 23 years younger than Dave.  Now you're talking.  Now I'm interested.  Yeah, but she wants somebody that doesn't need Viagra. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, God.  All right.  Hold on the line.  We'll talk to her.  Hold on.  Oh, thank you.  Hello?  Libby.  Yeah.  Libby, my name is Richard.  Wait, Richard.  I'll introduce you.  God damn.  What?  Libby, how are you?  It's Opie and Anthony again.  Hey.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I'm listening to you in the background.  I got blaring out of my speakers.  Hold on a second.  All right.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  I don't know whether they've got to interrupt us again.  Wait a minute.  Hold on, guy.  Just wait for the formal introduction. 
[00:58:00]  You're a horn dog.  Okay.  I'm ready.  This gentleman called up.  What's your name, sir?  Rich.  Richard called up because he's interested in dating you.  We're getting these guys calling up now that want to date you.  Oh, wow.  Because you sound like a really cool chick.  Those are not my words.  But there's a problem.  What?  How old are you, Rich?  I just turned 62.  No way, man.  Been there, done that.  Sorry. 
[00:58:30]  She wants a young guy.  Hey, listen.  I wish you the best no matter what.  I hate to make a, you know, rash decision like that, but I don't know.  What, you want a boy toy?  Yeah.  You want like an 18-year-old guy?  Yeah.  Hey, listen.  I'll have my son call.  Yeah.  You can make us peanut butter and jelly sandwiches or something.  Oh, God.  Libby, we could get you a young stud if you want.  Stud muffin.  I'm serious.  Yeah.  Oh, that'd be great. 
[00:59:00]  You're really, you know, this is very, this sounds like fun.  Hey, did Dave like our show, by the way?  Um, yeah.  I think so.  Yeah.  He did before I called.  I think before I called, he really liked it.  No.  Yeah, I don't think he'll be liking it that much now.  No, I don't, you know, I don't know.  We don't speak, so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I call him and he hangs up on me.  That's our repertoire.  Well, we'll admit this is very Howard Sternish, but if you want, if you come in here, we will  find you a young stud to go out with.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  We'll set you up.  We'll put you on the date.  We'll chaperone it so you don't get an axe murderer.  Oh, that'd be great.  I would do that.  Sure.  And while you're up here, we could also auction off some of Dave's stuff.  Listen, can I chaperone that date?  Huh?  Hey, shut up, guy.  I chaperone that date.  Oh.  Rich, she already blew you off, Rich.  You're gone, man.  Well, it was a good try anyway.  All right, Rich.  You guys are great.  Thanks, buddy.  I'm getting so much promotion from you guys.  Good luck to you, lady.  You know what?  My boss is here.  I better behave myself.  I'm real estate.  Well, did you get some of the stuff that you want to auction off? 
[01:00:00]  I did.  It's upstairs.  You're on until 7, right?  Yeah.  Can I call you back in like 15 minutes?  Yeah, you got it.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  There she goes once again, Libby.  Back in a few minutes with the items that she wants to sell of Dave's.  The items up for bid.  Yes.  Crazy Libby.  Crazy Libby.  She's practically giving it all away.  Oh, my God.  Divorce is brutal, isn't it?  Isn't it?  All right.  It's just so damn ugly.  Yes, it is.  On the way, everyone is requesting Steve Lynch songs. 
[01:00:30]  Mm-hmm.  You know, our pal from last Friday.  Yes.  We will end the show today with lullaby.  All right.  Coming up, we'll talk to Libby again to see what items are up for bid.  All right.  All right.  Oh, this is sick.  Why are people yelling and screaming?  Did you hear that?  There's a party going on.  Where's that party going on?  Everybody's ready to go to the party.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got the company Christmas party tonight.  Is it just NEW or is it CBS or is it Wins? 
[01:01:00]  I think it's just us.  I think it's just NEW, maybe Wins as well.  We're going to have a lot of fun tonight.  Yeah.  We'll sit down and hear the news from people.  So, what's new?  Did you hear today at the impeachment hearings?  Oh, drink, please.  Have a drink over here.  What time is it?  Oh, it's 9-0-1.  Time for traffic.  Traffic and weather together.  Together on the ones.  Dude, lighten up.  Hey, guys.  I'm going home in the next 10 minutes.  What do you think of the traffic?  That's good.  Hey, and now with sports, it's Jim. 
[01:01:30]  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW Creed.  What's this life for?  From their debut CD, My Own Prison.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  We're waiting for Libby Herman to call back with the items up for bid.  Libby, if you're listening, because she listens to our show, call us right now.  We'll put you on the air, please.  No.  In the meantime, it is FU Friday.  We forgot to talk about the lady that's suing Starbucks.  Oh, FU to her.  I hate those people.  More burned coffee people suing. 
[01:02:00]  This woman had coffee spilt on her ankle.  Well, what happened was she got a cup of coffee from Starbucks, and she was getting the cream  and the milk together, and she says like a couple drops hit her wrist.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Which freaked her out because it burned her a little bit, so then she spills the whole  damn thing on her ankle and burns her ankle.  Right.  And it was a pretty nasty burn, if that's how she got it, and now she's suing Starbucks  for a million dollars.  Now, who would she sue if she was home making coffee and dropped it on her foot, knowing that 
[01:02:30]  coffee is hot?  Right.  Like, what's the difference?  Right.  I don't understand how these are actual lawsuits and that people get the million dollars.  Remember the lady with the hot coffee that burned her groin?  Yeah.  The McDonald's coffee, and they ended up giving her a couple million dollars.  Her crotch was worth two million.  Yeah.  Or whatever it was.  And this girl's ankle, for some reason, is worth a million bucks.  Are we going to have to start putting warnings on the side of, you know, coffee cups? 
[01:03:00]  Yes.  Yes, Opie.  That's ridiculous.  That's ridiculous, though.  Wow, you're making a stand.  Wow.  I like that.  Well, I'm just wasting time.  I'm hoping Libby would call back, but...  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't notice.  I know.  Oh, well.  I guess she's not going to call us anymore.  Uh-oh, news just in.  What is that that you got in your hand?  Is that about Joe?  No, I'm looking at it.  Jolton Joe?  How's Jolton Joe doing?  Is he dead yet, or is he in the starting lineup for next season? 
[01:03:30]  He's still in the rundown between life and death.  Former Musketeer found guilty of stock fraud.  One of the original Musketeers has been found guilty of stock fraud.  Darlene Gillespie was convicted in L.A. today of a dozen federal charges.  She was accused of using phony or bounce checks to buy tens of thousands of shares in a stock swindle.  Oh.  And she could face up to 90 years in prison when she is sentenced March 8th. 
[01:04:00]  Oh.  Darlene?  Little cute Darlene.  I bet she bought Zoom.com.  Because if she bought a stock that went up, she'd be able to pay off the bad checks.  Yes.  How did your Zoom.com do?  Um, Opie, I closed out today at 26 and a quarter.  You may remember I purchased the day before yesterday.  No, I purchased yesterday.  Yesterday.  For a $38 a share.  And it Zoomed down to 26 and a quarter. 
[01:04:30]  So, uh, I'm waiting for it to come back.  Yeah.  I smell tax write-off.  What a pain.  Hello, hello, hello.  Hello.  Oh, wait.  Oh, no.  Why can't we?  Oh, hold on, Libby.  Hold on.  Okay.  I have to call for my cell phone because my phone is ringing off the hook.  I don't want to lose a...  All right.  Libby's on the phone again.  Hi, Libby.  Hi.  Okay. 
[01:05:00]  So, the phone is going nuts.  People are really interested in your garage sale.  Yeah.  I got, like, 20 calls on the...  I've talked to a few people.  And, yeah.  Thanks, guys.  Well, by the way, everyone is calling up.  Everyone wants to date you.  And we forgot to mention that you're really, really hot.  I'm very tall, though.  You know?  How tall are you?  Oh, what a shame.  I'm like 5'11".  5'11", blonde hair, like blue eyes, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very nice figure.  And you have a crappy cell phone.  Crappy cell phone and a little bit of an attitude.  But, you know. 
[01:05:30]  Okay.  So, did you get some of the items up for a bit?  I did.  Now, I've itemized here.  We have...  I hear you have auction houses calling you at home and stuff now.  I do.  I have...  The only thing, I don't have vinyl.  We had somebody come and buy both of the vinyl.  We had everything from Russian belly dancing music to, you know, Michael Jackson's E.T.  You know, just like...  Well, that isn't really Dave related.  Oh.  Yeah.  We wanted to know what...  We needed a good Dave memorabilia.  Well, how about Dave's favorite T-shirt of all time is his Pia Zadora nude boobie shot T-shirt. 
[01:06:00]  We have that.  Don't drink.  I should talk to us.  Oh, my God.  I'm kidding.  You think I'm kidding?  No.  Okay.  We have the Risky Business Tom Cruise movie.  You know, the cut-off sleeve black T-shirt, Risky Business with Bob Seger on the back.  All worn by Dave at some point.  Bruce-wise, we have...  Do you got any Bruce juice?  For you, we don't have...  Let's see.  I have this sweater that a listener made for me that I, you know, hesitate to part with, 
[01:06:30]  but I just...  It's just sitting there.  Somebody will wear it.  It's handmade, hand-crocheted, like a flag, but where the blue part is, it says, born in  the USA on one side, and let freedom ring on the back.  All right.  Hey, do you have any egg sandwiches from Breakfast with the Beatles?  No, but I did have an offer of bagels from somebody who's coming to the tag sale, so there  will be refreshments.  Now, Livvy...  What?  Dave was in the business for a very long time. 
[01:07:00]  The phone's ringing off the hook.  Did you hear this?  No.  It's crazy, I tell you.  He was in the business for a very long time.  This is all you got?  Don't you got, like, autographed CDs and stuff?  Huh?  Don't you have autographed CDs?  Come on, some stuff we have to keep, all right?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  What about a sweatshirt from the River Tour, 1980-81?  And does it have actual Dave Herman's sweat on it?  Yes, he did stink it up.  He did.  Okay.  He absolutely did.  I did wash it, however. 
[01:07:30]  Okay.  Okay.  We have Bruce's back where Rock lives on one side, and on the back, WNEW FM.  All right.  We have your Bruce Bruce Riefering in the UCB.  We have a lot of Bruce's T-shirts.  We have a Stone Pony Dancing in the Park T-shirt.  Okay.  I got to go in another room.  I can't hear.  The phone's going nuts.  The phone's just ringing off the hook.  Hold it.  I can't.  Anyway, my personal favorite from Stiff Records.  Do you remember Stiff Records?  Of course. 
[01:08:00]  Beautiful for the ladies.  You know, it's a French, you know, cut T-shirt.  It says, if it ain't stiff, it ain't no use to no one.  All right.  It's my personal favorite.  Okay.  Can you model that for us, maybe?  Huh?  Can you model that for us when you come in?  It says he's pranced through the studio with that on.  We have Super Tramp from the Crisis.  What Crisis?  God, this is better than Hunger Thons.  I'm telling you.  All right.  We got a Billy Joel HBO special T-shirt.  We have...  And these are all T-shirts worn by Dave? 
[01:08:30]  Yes, sir.  Wow.  Some by me, too.  Wow.  I think we might have had sex in one of these.  I'm not sure.  All right.  All right.  Do you have any used condoms or anything?  Oh, B.  What?  I thought it was not necessary.  I thought I'd ask.  We have a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers from the American Girl.  What's the...  Damn, this is right now.  Really early Tom Petty.  Really stinky.  Yeah.  Okay.  Very, very worn.  All right.  Wings across America.  Beatles.  All right.  Anything else, but... 
[01:09:00]  All right.  Obviously, the list goes on.  Oh, wait.  Oh, my...  Oh, here's a...  How about Dave's owned Asbury Jukes blue and white, you know, baseball jacket with Big D on  the front?  Oh.  That could be worth something to someone.  All right.  Actually, we have two Jukes.  All right.  All right.  Obviously...  He was an unofficial Juk.  He was the ninth Juk, I think.  All right.  Obviously, you got a lot of crap to sell.  All right.  Do you want to give out that phone number again?  Sure.  It's 201-568-7493. 
[01:09:30]  And if you leave your fax number, preferably, I can just fax directions from wherever and  where you're from.  All right.  And this will be a garage sale in the very near future.  It's actually in the basement.  Okay.  All right.  When are you going to come up?  Oh, I thought I lost you.  Oh, wait.  Oh, they're coming in.  All right.  All right.  I've got to look at the tote board.  Jesus.  All right.  I will...  Oh, my God.  You're going to come in, right?  Yeah.  And we're going to get you a young stud to, you know... 
[01:10:00]  Once I see you next week, I'll call you.  All right.  Cool.  Okay.  Have fun at the party tonight.  Thanks, Libby.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  There she goes, Libby Herman.  Wow.  Cool.  102 set...  What?  Well, I'm just going to read in some email.  It says, speaking of Starbucks coffee, haven't you guys seen the warning label on the side  of their coffee cups?  This beverage, the beverage that you are about to enjoy is extremely hot.  Use caution.  You guys are great.  Keep it up.  F.  Jackie and F.  Baba Booey.  GW.  The Rack of New York, 1027 WNEW.

Live on Two Legs is the name of the new Pearl Jam Live CD.  And I like it a lot.  Look at the clock.  Where did the time go?  Yeah, we've got to get out of here.  We've got to go to the company Christmas party.  Yeah.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Oh, yeah.  Can't wait.  It's going to be great.  Are you kidding? 
[01:11:00]  I'm excited.  No, I'm really excited about it.  So.  I just want to know if it's, is it just us?  Or is it wins?  Is it CBS?  It's all CBS.  All the CBS?  I don't think it's all CBS.  Well, I think in the city.  Oh.  Well, like all the New York. </pre>
