<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a Larry King parody introduction before diving into crude and provocative commentary.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton launched into a discussion of New York City Mayor's "micro-apartment" plan, mocking its size and comparing them to jail cells.  This transitioned into a critique of the low turnout at the "Million Big Gulp March," leading to broader commentary on government overreach and public apathy,  specifically focusing on the financial woes of Scranton, Pennsylvania and their anger towards perceived governmental mismanagement.  Their criticism extended to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), citing increased IRS involvement as an example of overreach.  Anthony shared an anecdote about someone cashing lottery tickets in Opie's name, resulting in an IRS tax dispute, further fueling their animosity toward the agency.  The hosts then discussed Reggie Jackson's controversial comments about A-Rod and the Hall of Fame, his subsequent apology, and the broader topic of honesty in sports and media.  This segued into a discussion of an ESPN announcer's apology for a comment about a car seat at a baseball game, which they viewed as an example of excessive corporate control and oversensitivity. This led to a misogynistic tirade concerning an ESPN personality’s criticism of Hannah Storm's attire and the subsequent apology.  Wayne Knight (Newman from *Seinfeld*) was announced as a later guest, and the show peppered frequent *Seinfeld* references throughout.

The next segment focused on a hypothetical "guys' weekend" getaway, filled with stereotypical masculine activities like golfing, NASCAR, fireworks, and a casino.  The conversation quickly devolved into crude sexual humor, focusing on lap dances, masturbation, and the properties of silk boxers.  They debated the merits of different types of eggs and the absurdity of excessive retail data collection. The discussion then shifted to the Tom Cruise/Katie Holmes divorce, speculating on its quick resolution and Scientology's potential involvement, followed by a review of Bob Backlund's WWE Raw appearance.  They mentioned upcoming guests: Wayne Knight, Brian Cranston, Aaron Paul, and Elijah Wood, and included a darkly comedic AmmuNation gun safety segment with "Derek the Dodo."  The segment concluded with further discussion of the Tom Cruise divorce and retail data collection practices.

The following segment began with a discussion of a past incident involving producer Than and E-Rock, followed by a discussion of E-Rock's Twitter habits, particularly his spamming of Adam Carolla. The main focus then turned to the impressive guest lineup: Wayne Knight, Brian Cranston, Aaron Paul, and Elijah Wood, with humorous debate over their relative importance.  Wayne Knight joined in-studio, discussing his new sitcom, *The Exes*, his experiences on *JFK* and *Jurassic Park* (including graphic details about special effects), his career as a private investigator, his time on *Seinfeld*, his divorce, and his memories of working with Michael Richards.  A "F.U." segment with listener messages and an interruption by "Jimmy from Staten Island," who described a Christmas light scam, also occurred.  Brian Cranston then joined, discussing the upcoming season of *Breaking Bad*, hinting at its dark direction without spoilers.

The next segment featured a continued *Breaking Bad* discussion with Brian Cranston, delving into Walter White's character development and Cranston's approach to portraying him, including his backstory and stylistic choices.  Cranston discussed his acting process, including improvisation and handling on-screen emotions, and mentioned the upcoming final season.  Elijah Wood then joined, discussing *Wilfred* and *The Hobbit*, touching on social media, dating, acting challenges,  and awkward past experiences, including a humorous discussion of unsolicited dick pics.  He discussed the upcoming seasons of *Wilfred*, hinting at scenes involving a blowjob and "doggy dancing," and the *Hobbit* films.  The hosts then reflected on the day's guests, the female listeners present, and shared various humorous anecdotes, including a story about Sal's severe diarrhea on a bus.

The final segment revolved around a hypothetical discussion about whether the hosts would allow their wives to sleep with various celebrities, starting with Perry Farrell and expanding to include Chris Cornell, the Stanley Cup (dry humping only), and others.  They discussed their own hypothetical celebrity sexual partners and one host’s wife’s hypothetical list, revealed through a guessing game, ultimately including Jimmy Fallon, Trent Reznor, Martin Brodeur, and Eli Manning.  The hosts debated the acceptability of each choice, considering attractiveness and personality.  Humorous moments arose from the absurdity of the scenarios, along with discussion of their personal relationships and past dating experiences. One host received a call from his wife clarifying a text, and the segment briefly touched upon a producer facing consequences for perceived lack of guest bookings.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Nice to meet you.  How did I sit?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you somehow find this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is you'll be sticking around.  Let's do it.  It's going down, Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show  right here on SiriusXM's Satellite Radio. 
[00:00:30]  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Just remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Why does he want to make tiny apartments?  I don't know.  That's how I start today.  Good morning, everyone.  Good morning.  The mayor of New York wants to make tiny apartments, teeny, weeny apartments.  Does anyone know why?  Probably wants to like Japan.  Just load up a bunch of people on top of each other.  Like in a night table drawer and dresser drawers.  Yeah.  Put them in a bureau.  Well, New Yorkers are ornery to begin with, and now you're going to throw them in tiny apartments? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  The apartments are already small in New York City.  He sure has a weird fucking angle on New York.  I didn't read that whole story.  It just looked, I don't know.  It didn't look enticing enough for me to read, but the diagram of these tiny apartments that  he wants to set up, is he taking over old buildings or something and decide, let's squeeze  tiny apartments in there?  Micro apartments for singles.  It's definitely the same thing they're doing in Japan, where the hand can be used like 
[00:02:30]  a knife.  Nah.  I can't do it.  But most people have a one-bedroom apartment, and that means one room, really, where you  have your bed, sort of a living room, and sort of a kitchen.  A kitchen, excuse me.  A kitchen.  A kitchen.  They already have that.  Yeah.  So what's different?  Um, I think it's really, really micro.  Like, like, it's fucking, it's the size of a bathroom. 
[00:03:00]  275 to 300 feet.  See, you saying that, people around the country are gonna think you're bullshitting.  No.  That's what happens in New York.  10 foot by 30 feet.  It's a jail cell.  10 feet by 30 feet.  They have to have, he's saying, they each have to have a bathroom in them, and they have  to have a small, teeny kitchen area.  How do you do that in a 10 by 30 foot space?  Dude, they were.  Looking at the layout, it looks pretty fucking pathetic.  They said other, what else is between 275 and 300 feet? 
[00:03:30]  Penthouse parking spot at 211th Avenue in Chelsea.  Yeah, so basically.  A parking spot.  Basically a basic parking spot.  Gotcha.  Average city hotel room.  Citibank, ATM, vestibule in Times Square.  Um, wow.  High school baseball dugout.  A dugout.  So imagine living in a dugout.  But why is he setting this up?  Because you know it's not gonna be affordable.  Well, they said it's in a place called Kipps Bay, which is for singles and people who are  just starting out and can't afford anything else. 
[00:04:00]  Well, Kevin from Connecticut already did the math.  One 30-story building, 65,000 apartments.  All right.  Wow.  There you go.  That's pretty funny.  Wow.  I don't know if we need this.  It's very Japanese.  Yeah.  It's very, uh, they don't have much room there, so that's what they do.  But we have room.  We could still build up.  Stack them up.  I know.  We're still capable of building up in New York.  The mayor's weird.  When's he done? 
[00:04:30]  When the fuck is he done?  Uh, whenever he decides, obviously.  Yeah.  He was supposed to be done four years ago.  He'll put in for another term.  You know, I think they had a march on City Hall yesterday.  Did you hear about this?  I think that didn't go well.  Oh, it didn't?  One dozen people showed up.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  For what?  Well, uh, no surprise.  For the million Big Gulp March, they called it.  They were trying to do a Big Gulp March, but let's be honest, those type of people aren't  marching much to be here with.  They were telling the mayor.  No offense.  No offense.  Telling the mayor that, uh, this policy about no huge beverages, sugary beverages, uh, is 
[00:05:00]  not something the government should be involved in, which I agree with.  I don't think the government should be involved in anything like that.  It's sort of hard to protest it because it's one of those things that a lot of people go,  well, all right, we'll just get two smaller sodas, and it's just the fat people that want  this.  But in principle, it's very important because, again, it's, you know, if you take away the  goofiness of a giant drink and fighting for your giant drinks, what you're really fighting 
[00:05:30]  for is to keep the government out of your shit and your decision making.  That's why I think everyone should have showed up yesterday.  Yeah, that's what it means.  We all should have showed up there yesterday.  Yeah, we're all apathetic.  Because you make a great point.  It's not about the silly, massive, goofy Big Gulp drink.  Just put something in the Big Gulp's place that you enjoy and you want, that if a politician  said you couldn't have it, you'd be pissed.  I mean, you know, because that's what it boils down to is the government is really, and it's 
[00:06:00]  it's not just local, it's not just the mayor of New York.  This is really becoming a very national thing.  The government just stepping in and fucking with you.  Just fucking with you.  And people just lay over.  They just roll over and fucking let it happen.  Are you starting to think...  We're all guilty of it.  Are you finally...  Well, I shouldn't say finally, because I think I...  You're starting to think that the government sucks.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I completely do.  Governor Christie, you know, he's a big blowhard, but he went after both parties. 
[00:06:30]  You'll hear that clip all day today.  We should get it, matter of fact, down the hall.  Yeah.  He went after both parties.  I like that.  Instead of going with the party line, bullshit every single time.  Yeah.  He's disappointed with the Democrats and the Republicans down in Washington.  What politicians do these days is not in the public's best interest.  It's...  All they're doing is auditioning for their next job.  They're doing things to try to keep themselves in office.  That's all.  Nothing's in your best interest anymore. 
[00:07:00]  They stopped representing their constituency years ago.  I don't know what they think they're doing when they say they're representing  their people, and they put in place these laws and regulations that no one would want.  No.  So who the fuck are they representing?  I don't know.  It's angering.  A long time ago, we stopped reading what they were doing for us.  Yeah.  Well, they made it so you couldn't read it.  Of course they did.  They put it in language and in length and legalese that nobody could decipher. 
[00:07:30]  Well, half the time, they don't even read their own shit.  When those bills are passed, it's like, well, it's a 700-page bill.  Did you read it?  Well, no.  I had an intern scan through it.  They have their interns scan through it.  They give them their basic idea of what it's supposed to be.  And then they make the decision.  Yeah, I'll sign that.  All right.  You know, to this point, they had a huge story yesterday that Scranton, the city of  Scranton, a little city in Pennsylvania, right? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Ran out of money.  Just ran out of money.  And that just amazes me.  How does a place run out of money that seems to be filled with people trying to work hard?  Yeah.  And they ran out of money.  They just ran out of money.  Yeah.  And you'll have to look at the politicians and go, really?  Everyone was paying their taxes.  What the fuck did you do with the money that they're now broke?  Yeah.  I don't get it.  How does a city run out of money?  By-  They say New York City is in trouble, right? 
[00:08:30]  They've been cutting all sorts of shit over the last few years.  By not handling the money properly.  They-  They-  Because-  You know why?  Because it's a free-  They have free reign.  And it's an influx of cash that doesn't stop.  It doesn't fucking stop.  Right.  And they can twist the screws and make you pay more.  Right.  And you have no say in the matter.  Well, that's why I was outraged.  They want to raise everyone's taxes-  Yes.  ...locally in Scranton to, you know, cover, you know, the-  Their fuck-ups. 
[00:09:00]  The deficit.  Right.  If there's a government deficit, they fucked up.  Of course.  They fucked up.  But there's no accountability.  And there's no reason for them to do better because the money keeps rolling in.  Mm-hmm.  Because they hold us hostage with these taxes that we are forced to pay, no matter what the  fuck they say it is, or else, you know, you go to jail.  Well, at the very least, though, if you pay your taxes, your city shouldn't run out of 
[00:09:30]  money.  At the very least.  Yep.  Yeah, I know that's dumbing it way the fuck down, but holy fuck, what the hell's going  on?  It really is getting horrible.  And, you know, I'm not playing partisan politics here.  But what's happening with this Obamacare thing, as far as letting the Internal Revenue Service  dig more into your fucking life and your freedoms, is one of the worst things I've ever seen happen  in this country.  What's this about?  Well, it's, well, you know about Obamacare, and everybody needs to have health insurance 
[00:10:00]  in this country, or else you're penalized, as he says.  You mean Romneycare?  Taxed.  You mean Romneycare?  It started with Romney, right?  It is different.  But it also is, you know, Romney should own it.  Romney should get out and say, yeah, I tried something, it didn't work.  Right.  And now Obama's trying it.  Why is he too scared to say that?  Because, of course, they get 20,000 people telling him what to do, and everybody hedges 
[00:10:30]  and haws, and no one thinks a politician should be able to come out and say they made a mistake.  You know what sucks about these politicians, and we'll get back to your point, you don't  really know what they're actually thinking.  Yeah.  Because they just look at polls and go, well, oh, I've got to say this, actually.  Even though I think this, the polls are telling me differently.  I should say this.  So I better move over here.  Just be honest.  Say something didn't work that you did.  You're not, we don't, we don't look for perfection in politicians.  I think honesty beats out fucking perfection, but they try to put this veil that they've 
[00:11:00]  never made a mistake.  Politicians can never come out and say, yeah, I tried to enact something, it didn't work,  you know, let's try something else.  They don't do that.  It's our fault, though.  It is ultimately our fault because we penalize them when they tell the truth and we don't  like it.  You're right.  Like when they say something, we always go, we allow them to be crucified publicly.  So we bring it on ourselves.  We never, like you said, that march had 12 people.  Yeah.  We never fight for guys who are doing the right thing. 
[00:11:30]  And so we kind of deserve shitty people.  We should have been there.  We, um, we've allowed, you know, other people, by the, by the way, yeah.  I was busy yesterday.  I agree.  I was busy too.  By the way, uh, we, the assholes could have stepped up for us.  Obamacare is allowing the internal revenue service to really delve into your lives more.  There, the IRS is hiring a shitload more people to get into your shit.  The IRS is one of the most feared fucking organizations in the nation. 
[00:12:00]  So he's hiring a lot more people to get more money.  To get more money.  And because this Obamacare thing.  To really look at your returns and all that shit, right?  Well, not so much.  It's also to handle Obamacare.  Right.  It hinges on the Internal Revenue Service to dole out these penalties, taxes, when you don't have the insurance.  And the people that are going to keep track, if you have or don't have insurance, is the Internal Revenue Service. 
[00:12:30]  This is not something that the Internal Revenue Service was ever supposed to do in this country.  They're not supposed to be handling things like health care.  This is supposed to be a revenue collecting agency.  And now they're getting involved in some way, shape or form into your health care, your forced health care.  It's infuriating.  It's infuriating.  And it's, again, what we're saying, another thing.  And I'm not just saying the Democrats or Obama.  The Republicans are doing the same thing.  Getting their shit, their nose in your fucking asses. 
[00:13:00]  And it's just going to keep getting worse and worse.  It's unbelievable.  It really is.  How do you fuck up America?  How do you fuck it up?  Well, they're doing it.  It's amazing.  Slowly but surely, right?  Not even slowly anymore.  Yeah.  Seems to be moving quite quickly.  Don't cheat on your taxes and you need not fear.  Master Queef's a dick bag.  People fear the Internal Revenue Service.  And it doesn't have to do with cheating on your taxes.  The tax code is so fucked up now that a lot of people could just make an honest mistake. 
[00:13:30]  And the penalties and interest you have to pay is astounding.  It's worse than a fucking loan shark.  I want to tag that.  I think way more people are making honest mistakes than cheating on their taxes, by the way.  Not only that, how about your old pal Anthony here had a motherfucking savage cashed two lottery tickets under my fucking name in Pennsylvania.  He fucking went into a convenience store. 
[00:14:00]  I saw the tape.  He's a fucking animal.  What are you talking about?  This was a couple of years back.  We talked about this.  A guy took two lottery tickets that he probably did for five grand each.  Probably stole the fucking things out of a store, some inside job with another one of his savage fucking cohorts, and won $10,000.  No, it was $5,000.  It was $2,500 each for five grand.  He went in and used my name.  Didn't have my social security number, so that's not even on there. 
[00:14:30]  But since my name and address was on there, he had my address also.  Please, please come over!  Come over!  Oh, and I'd love to shoot you in the face.  Wow.  So he fucking...  Anthony's tugging his cock as he says this.  So he fucking cashes the tickets under my name.  I'm still, still trying to get the internal fuck revenue service off my ass for $5,000 that they want me to pay taxes on,  because some animal cashed a fucking ticket in my name. 
[00:15:00]  What do they say when you...  They don't fucking believe me!  They know what, you can't get to anyone either.  I want to talk to a person and say, I didn't do it, and then they go prove it.  I'm like, how am I going to prove it?  So they want to wear you down, and then you would just go, you know what, I'll just write this fucking check to get it over with.  Exactly.  That's what they do.  Holy fuck.  They want their fucking money.  They know that they're not getting it off of Tyrone, so they got to fucking come for me.  They're the worst.  Fuck you!  And they don't have to pay, they don't have to pay any money for all the fucking amount of legal expenses they put you through, 
[00:15:30]  because it's not their fucking money going into their lawyers.  Exactly.  It's just the fucking state's money, or the government's money, or it's our money.  It's all they wanted.  They really are fucking disgusting.  It's infuriating.  So what's going on with this Obamacare?  What's the next step?  The next step is trying to get it fucking repealed.  What's the odds of that?  We'll wait for 2014 when it really kicks in, and see what happens. 
[00:16:00]  Is it actually going to kick in?  If Romney gets elected, I'm sure he's going to try to have it repealed.  Right.  But he's having a tough time right now.  He's only even with the president right now.  We'll see what happens.  It's still early.  A lot of the states, too, are refusing it, and then they take it to court and try to say they're infringing on states' rights.  You know, this whole thing where it was called a tax by the court,  and letting the government force you to do something with the penalty of this tax. 
[00:16:30]  Taxes aren't supposed to be used as a penalty.  It's a revenue collection to keep the government running, to serve the people.  Not as a penalty.  It was never supposed to be a fucking whip at your back.  Fucking taxes.  Stop it already.  Man.  But now it is, and it opens up a precedent for other things to be used under the umbrella of the Internal Revenue Service.  Of course. 
[00:17:00]  The fucking organization you do not want over your head for collecting taxes, never mind your health care,  or whatever else they want to fucking now pencil in underneath their awning.  There's the IRS coming after you right there.  There it is.  The big shark fin chasing the guy on the guy.  That's a perfect analogy of the Internal Revenue Service.  Look how afraid that guy looks as he's trying to paddle away.  He's paddling as fast as he can.  By the way, that other guy wasn't on the shore.  He was kneeling, but we couldn't see that yesterday because of all the graphics. 
[00:17:30]  He was in the water on a paddleboard kneeling.  Here's Governor Christie in between ice cream cones.  In the end, my message is that leadership is the only thing.  Wow, this is a bad version.  I heard a better version.  It's not even the acoustics.  He just sounds like that.  Oh, really?  It's just fat resonating.  In the end, my message is that leadership is the only thing that will make the difference.  It's the only thing that will make the difference.  And leadership is not just about obstructionism. 
[00:18:00]  Leadership is also not about caving every time you get pushed.  Leadership is about nuance and about understanding and communicating to people.  Here is what I stand for, and on these issues I will not be moved.  But then on other issues, leaving room for discussion and accomplishing principled compromise where it can be.  There you go. 
[00:18:30]  They were saying he's talking as he's looking in the refrigerator.  That's right.  It's funny.  The irony of a big fatso talking about how he cannot be moved.  Yeah.  He was talking about both parties.  They got to fucking compromise.  Yeah, that just doesn't happen because, again, they're just auditioning for their next gig.  We're in an era where no one compromises down there.  I mean, it seems to be worse than it's ever been.  I don't know.  The little I know about this shit.  It really does.  Everything the other party does is called out by the other party as being the worst thing ever in the history of the world. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  And it doesn't mean that there aren't things happening that aren't the worst thing in the history of the world.  But it's not everything.  Come on.  You know.  It's like they show you how funny they are during the State of the Union.  How could the president from the other party very coincidentally always say things that his own party agrees with and always say things the other party disagrees with?  That's disgusting. 
[00:19:30]  They just stand up and go, ah!  How about you have a mind of your own?  Just a little bit.  How about you be the guy that goes, you know what?  No, I'm not applauding for that one.  Yeah.  I don't like that one.  Just half the friggin' audience is clapping and cheering and then the other half.  That's so embarrassing.  They sit there.  Yeah.  Watched the Home Run Derby yesterday.  Holy shit.  It just goes too long.  It just goes too fucking long.  Chris Berman?  Anyone? 
[00:20:00]  It just goes too long.  I couldn't fucking be bothered.  Travis was telling me the first round was an hour and a half.  I sit here today telling you I did not watch the Home Run Derby.  Nah.  I used to watch the Home Run Derby.  I don't know what happened.  I've lost interest in the Home Run Derby.  Yeah.  But the first round, an hour and a half.  That's half a baseball game.  That's crazy.  It's just too long.  Who won in the end?  Prince?  Prince?  Prince Prince? 
[00:20:30]  Whoa.  I don't know how you can fucking...  What the artist formerly known as.  He won.  Well, he's not formerly known anymore.  That's cool as shit.  Well, now that he's won, no.  Who knew that he could hit the fucking ball?  Now he's the king.  He's the home run king.  How about Robbie Cano?  Don't you know.  Don't you know.  He got nothing.  Why were they booing him?  Zero home runs.  Why?  Well, as Travis puts it, he had say in who was picked for the All-Star team.  And I gather that he didn't pick one of the Royals' big guys. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  And it was in Kansas City, so they booed him.  They booed him like a motherfucker.  Oh, that's no surprise.  Yeah.  That will happen.  Yeah.  And what's up with Reggie?  This is our baseball.  Oh, by the way, we were just talking about being honest.  Yeah, yeah.  This is what...  We don't like people to be honest because when they speak their minds, they're penalized for it.  Yeah.  So stop saying we want people to be honest.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right. 
[00:21:30]  Because we heard this morning what Reggie said, and it's not even that big of a deal.  It's not that big a deal.  And if you don't know this yet, the great Reggie Jackson, who could be a prick at times.  We could be honest with each other.  He's always been an old curmudgeon.  But fuck, a hell of a baseball player has been banned by the Yankees for kind of speaking  out about A-Rod.  Yeah.  And it's not even that bad.  No.  He was questioning his Hall of Fame, A-Rod's Hall of Fame, whether he should be inducted because 
[00:22:00]  of his admission to using some type of enhancement drugs.  Correct.  He also said he doesn't think that Gary Carter, Jim Rice, Kirby Puckett, and Burt Blylevin shouldn't  be in the Hall.  And he said they shouldn't be.  But they are in the Hall, and he thinks they shouldn't be.  And I think that...  That's not too crazy to say.  Jim Rice was right on the fence, I remember.  Well, Carter got...  It took Jim Rice years to get on the fence.  And he was right on the fence. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  And Reggie doesn't think he belongs there.  That's not outrageous.  And he died of brain...  Well, because he died of brain cancer.  I guess they were friends.  Oh, Carter?  Yeah.  I don't know how this comment got in the Sports Illustrated, but he's actually very disappointed  that it's out there.  He said he's embarrassed.  And he has the number for Gary's wife, and he wants to talk to her and the family, and  he said he wants to apologize for inappropriate comments.  Like, that's what he feels bad about, because the guy just died of brain cancer.  What's the inappropriate comment?  I don't know how it was...  What the phrasing was.  He said, Gary's hat was filled with melted Reggie bars. 
[00:23:00]  What's inappropriate about that?  I don't know how he said it.  If he dies tragically, you're not allowed to discuss his stats?  Exactly.  And if that was enough to get into the Hall of Fame?  I think the Yankees are more upset that he's talking about how Andy Pettit and A-Rod shouldn't  be in the Hall of Fame, and they're still active players.  Yeah.  And he's one of the people...  He's in the Yankee organization.  He gets paid.  But you know where this is coming from?  I do believe, unless he got away with murder, that Reggie Jackson is frustrated, because 
[00:23:30]  he knows what kind of numbers he put up without using drugs.  Yeah.  So, of course, he's going to take this stance.  And Reggie...  This is what happened.  Reggie, he was kind of contrite, they said, about his comments, which were made at a lunch  with Friends and Sports Illustrated's Phil Taylor, who I guess they got the article.  And Reggie refused to say that Taylor misquoted him.  So, I guess he didn't misquote him.  And Reggie also said that he never told Taylor that they were on or off the record.  So, he probably...  I don't know if Reggie drinks or not, but he might have gotten a little loose at lunch. 
[00:24:00]  I don't know.  A loose at lunch.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, and forgot he was with a reporter.  If you're with one of those guys, you've just got to be completely aware.  What was the comment?  They don't have the exact quote.  Yeah, we had it earlier somewhere else.  Oh, okay.  I heard he then fucking dragged the World Series trophy around the parking lot from the back  of his car.  He was trying to get fired.  He was trying to get fired.  And then, what was he wearing?  Babe Ruth's shirt and eating strawberries. 
[00:24:30]  They said, he's not banned from the team.  This is because in Boston, they said they wanted to die down a little bit.  Yeah.  He said he's embarrassed.  I fear no retribution.  He says, Al's a very good friend, but I think there are real questions about his numbers,  Jackson told S.I.  Al?  Al Rodriguez.  Hey, Rod.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Al.  Al.  Okay, Pookie.  He hit the ball.  He said, my numbers aren't good. 
[00:25:00]  As much as I like him, what he admitted about his usage does cloud some of his records.  That's a pretty honest statement.  That's not too crazy.  Absolutely.  And then the Yankees go, oh, boy, you're banned.  For saying that?  Yeah.  They said it's only because...  Yeah, let's make believe that that wasn't happening in baseball for a while, and they're  trying to figure out what to do with all that.  He's not banned, though.  He's temporarily...  No, no.  It's not a distraction.  He'll be back in.  You can't boot Reggie out of the Yankee organization.  All right.  We just want to be back on the Yankees. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  Did Reggie apologize for that?  Did A-Rod comment?  No, I think just Gary Quirier.  Good.  Good for Reggie.  He said he spoke to A-Rod, and then when reporters asked A-Rod about it, he said, with  friends like that, who needs enemies?  Oh, boy.  But he was kidding, I think, when he said it.  I don't think he's happy.  No, probably not.  He's probably not happy.  He probably said it at a lunch, though.  Again, he probably said it like...  Because A-Rod's an egomaniac.  He just wants the whole world to love him.  It's fucking Mr. October, though.  Come on.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, did A-Rod have a fucking candy bar named after him? 
[00:26:00]  No.  He sure didn't.  I rest my case, Your Honor.  Reggie was clutch.  When's the last time fucking A-Rod had three home runs in a World Series, much less in  a row?  How about one?  How about a hit?  Yeah.  Bastard.  Mr. Choke.  Exactly.  I love when a baseball player stinks.  They call him Mr. April.  That was good.  Mr. June.  I loved Reggie bars when I was a kid.  Oh, I hated them.  Why would you?  Because they got peanut butter in them, right?  Oh, God, I love peanut butter.  I'm obsessed with peanut butter lately. 
[00:26:30]  I eat peanut butter in everything.  I love a Reggie bar.  I was too young for Reggie bars, but we had Wade Boggs candy bars.  Oh, no.  What the hell was that?  What was that?  I think it was when he was chasing 400.  What candy were they ripping off?  I don't know.  Yeah, because that's pretty much what they do.  And what candy did the Reggie bar rip off?  It's been too many years.  It was nougaty with peanuts.  Nougaty.  Yeah, it was a lovely.  I like a nice nougat.  I love it.  You give me a nougaty candy bar.  I don't even know what a nougat is, but I know it tastes delicious.  What is it?  Reggie bar is fucking rude.  I don't know. 
[00:27:00]  You don't even know?  Is it a made-up candy word?  Nougat.  God damn, I love the Reggie bar.  All right, we need to know what candy bar.  It's all white and nougat chocolate.  It's all white chocolate.  It's always above the fucking dark chocolate on the shelf.  Ty Cobb was an ass.  I want to know what bars these guys ripped off.  The Wade Boggs?  What was the Wade Boggs?  It just says a milk chocolate bar.  What was it?  Just fucking chocolate?  It was the Wade Boggs 352 bar.  Oh, he didn't want to get fucking sued. 
[00:27:30]  So he made it just plain chocolate.  And it's got Wade Boggs in a very bland uniform with no team name.  That looked terrible.  How much of those Reggie bars, you can't probably get them with the chocolate in them.  I'm sure there's somewhere still.  But how can you save something like that?  Like, are you dry?  Just the wrappers?  Yeah, well, I mean, you can just save the bar or you just don't open it.  It would melt in there.  Not necessarily, unless it's not.  Put it in a refrigerator in my office. 
[00:28:00]  Jimmy's asking because he needs one of these now for his collection.  I don't know what I would do with this.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Wayne Knight's coming in today, right?  It's a very Seinfeld day today.  Yeah, Wayne Knight from Seinfeld will be in today.  How much?  Ten bucks?  Ten bucks.  Get a ten buck Reggie bar.  These things aren't worth anything.  Just so you have it.  You think they are, but they're not.  And then you can have him sign it, Jimmy.  No, I have a picture with him.  I want him to sign it.  Me and E-Rock came back for pictures one day.  Uh-oh, the Reggie bar was like the Baby Ruth.  Not good.  Not good. 
[00:28:30]  Wayne wants to comment on the Reggie thing.  Baby Ruth was not named after Babe Ruth, though.  It was named after Ruth, one of the daughters of, um, who was it?  Which president?  Oh, Eisenhower.  Uh, no.  No, it was Ruth Gordon.  No.  You were among delicious treats, Ricky.  It was Eisenhower.  It wasn't Dr. Ruth, no.  Uh, Roosevelt.  It was Roosevelt's daughter, Ruth.  Nope.  Right?  Grover Cleveland.  Grover Cleveland?  Oh, Grover Cleveland.  Sorry.  Ruth Cleveland.  What a terrible name. 
[00:29:00]  Grover Cleveland and his daughter, Ruth.  What happened to Ruth?  Ruth.  She got a candy bar named after her and then she died.  When did she die?  Why did she die?  I don't know.  She was a very long time ago.  Why do people die?  And later, she'd be, uh, immortalized in a shit scene in a, uh, pool in Caddyshack.  That's funny.  Baby Ruth in the pool.  There you go.  Oh, she was young.  There you, oh, that's why it's called Baby Ruth.  Baby Ruth.  Why did they name it after her?  What the fuck did she do?  After a dead kid?  She died when she was 13. 
[00:29:30]  Let's have some Lindbergh baby treats.  She died when she was 13?  She died at 12 of diphtheria.  Diphtheria?  Oh my God, what is that?  She had diphtheria?  Did the bar come out after she died?  17 years after her death.  That's disgusting.  17 years.  That's disturbing.  17 years, no one gives a fuck anymore.  Her nickname was Baby Ruth Cleveland.  And you're eating a candy bar.  Wow.  Aunt Baby.  Dipped in chocolate.  Diphtheria and you dipped it in chocolate.  Terrible.  How old would Aunt Baby be if she was alive? 
[00:30:00]  She would have never made it.  Seinfeld.  Of course.  Aunt Baby.  I called her Aunt Baby.  Baby Ruth.  That's morbid, man.  That's fucking morbid.  I'm not eating those anymore.  Fuck that.  Hey, Wayne, what do you got on the Reggie Jackson thing?  Shop with diphtheria bars.  It's a diphtheria bar.  That's what, yeah.  Oh, it's crazy.  It's delicious. 
[00:30:30]  Wayne.  It's delicious.  Very refreshing.  I don't have anything about the Baby Ruth or the Reggie Bar, but about the internal raping service that Anthony's got me all up in arms about.  Yes.  It says you want to comment on the Jackson comment.  No, the IRS.  Who the fuck's screaming the calls?  Who's doing the phone today?  Who got that wrong?  Who got it wrong?  Connor's saying that's what he said he wanted to talk about.  Oh, it was Connor.  I love how you come into the organization as an intern. 
[00:31:00]  Next thing you know, you get one of the most important jobs.  Yeah.  Answering the phones.  Yeah.  Well, he said the guy lied.  How is that possible?  Connor says the guy lied, but Connor has screwed up before.  So get him off the fucking phones.  Well, then we put Rob on, and Rob is the one who put the Velveeta, Velveenus thing.  Oh, it was huge to do.  Velveenus.  Velveenus, Velveeta.  All right, what do you got, Wayne?  You're here.  You might as well talk.  All right, what's up?  The IRS, do you know that now, if you are just suspected of owing money, they can take your passport and keep you from traveling? 
[00:31:30]  Until they figure it out?  Well, until they decide that you're wrong.  It really is, and you have no recourse but to go through their investigators and stuff.  There's no taking the IRS to court.  You know, you're really at their mercy, and it's a frightening – people don't like the IRS.  They're very frightened of them. 
[00:32:00]  It sucks.  Thank you, sir.  All right, C. Thanks, Connor.  Oh, Connor.  Really taking advantage of your internship, thanks.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, no.  What the fuck?  Oh, no.  He's screwed up a lot on the phone.  Has he really?  Didn't get him all out.  Iraq.  No, he was found guilty for screwing up the Velveenus call last week.  Iraq.  He's the one who actually changed the thing that you yelled at before.  Remember when the phone screen was changed as you were answering?  Oh, shit.  Iraq, why are you putting him on the phones? 
[00:32:30]  You're the boss, Iraq, of the interns.  Yeah, you're in charge of them.  You're king of the interns.  Intern king shit.  Why?  Well, we only have two interns, and they both have had issues with the phone, so I don't  know what else to do.  Well, could you get Rob in here to do it?  Is Rob here?  Tell him to answer the phones and do something for this fucking channel.  Wait, wait, wait.  He's not talking about Handsome, Rob.  He's talking about the guy that interns for the channel.  Yeah, that guy.  Oh.  He seems to be a pretty good intern.  Get him on the phones.  Okay.  Rob Cross is our supervisor, direct supervisor. 
[00:33:00]  Well, tell him to supervise the fucking phones.  Can you get him on the phones for real?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  I don't think he's here.  Well, wake him up and tell him we need him on the phones today.  Like, what else does he do for the channel?  What about our Handsome Intern Rob?  Huh?  Not our Handsome Intern Rob?  Rob Cross.  The guy's been interning here forever.  You know who was a good intern?  Remember Darren from Cramerica?  Seinfeld?  Yeah, he helped Cramer with the big oil, oil ball. 
[00:33:30]  Do you know, I have to live in my bladders.  Cramerica Industries.  I haven't understood one Seinfeld record.  No, of course not.  You don't watch.  You don't watch.  I know.  I don't.  I realize how much I've never watched that.  It's not that I think it's not a good show.  I just never watched it.  Oh, but to your credit, believe me, these aren't common references we're making here.  These are pretty in-depth.  They're very deep.  These are some deep cuts.  How many are you going to slide in when Newman's here?  Oh, please. 
[00:34:00]  It's going to be a fucking Seinfeld fest.  Worse than William Shatner?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I'm just going to fucking pound him with Seinfeld references and see how that works.  Yeah, Wayne Knight's coming in at 830.  I've heard he embraces it, though.  He should.  Does he embrace it?  Fucking Newman, for God's sake.  Some of these guys don't like embracing their characters.  He was in the building like six months ago, and I had him sign my Seinfeld DVD, and he  seemed pretty cool with the whole, you know, this is what I'm known for type deal.  Because what is he promoting? 
[00:34:30]  Anything we give a fuck about?  Yeah, he's promoting a new TV show.  He's got a sitcom on TV land.  It's called The Exes.  Has he ever had an interaction with Dr. Watley?  No, but he got his Super Bowl tickets.  Oh, he did get his Super Bowl tickets, but never an on-screen interaction.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Mm.  Yeah.  You can ask him at the Super Bowl, then.  Then he got all those freebies.  Of course, yeah.  He's that label, man.  That's his character.  Yes.  Did E-Rock call Rob Cross?  You have to come in to do the phones?  I don't know.  He sent a text. 
[00:35:00]  You did?  Yeah.  All right.  Let me know what he says.  Man.  We got an ESPN guy in trouble.  What happened?  I don't know.  I'm going to apologize.  Did he say something about race?  Oh, I thought you said we did.  What?  I thought you said we got an ESPN guy in trouble.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I thought you meant we did something.  No, no, no, no.  This is what happened.  Top two, Ricky Weeks getting the Brewers back in the game.  Home run to right field, his eighth of the year.  But check this out as the fan is trying to catch the souvenir. 
[00:35:30]  No.  That is a car seat.  Come on.  I mean, what is this, trailer park day?  The baby, fortunately, is okay.  That is a safety device, people.  Same inning.  Is that it?  Yeah.  People in trailer parks felt bad.  What happened?  Wasn't ESPN supposed to be kind of a cool place for guys to go and kind of see sports 
[00:36:00]  and guys acting like guys?  A guys network.  And now they apologize for everything?  Yeah.  That was nothing.  Pussies.  I don't even know what's the problem there.  That was nothing.  Is that really your advertising demo target trailer park people?  Who gives a fuck?  Fuck them.  What happened, though?  He had an empty car seat in the thing, and he tried to catch a foul ball or whatever  with his car seat.  That's pretty funny.  Why did he bring a car seat into the game? 
[00:36:30]  He's white trash.  He's from the trailer park.  I'm sorry.  That's kind of white trash.  I guess.  To bring a car seat into a baseball game.  So it's pretty accurate.  Oh, my God.  Then this happened, I guess.  This is 30 minutes later.  Earlier in the show, I made a comment about a fan.  I love the vocal.  I love that.  Fuck it.  It's the same every time.  It's amazing.  It's the same guy.  Earlier in the show.  They always got to say earlier in the show, oh, boy, get a load of this.  Oh, boy.  I found a man at ESPN, and they might fire me. 
[00:37:00]  I better say something.  What I did.  Does ESPN ever back their fucking talent?  Ever?  They really stink.  They're owned by Disney.  God, what cowards.  That's that corporate umbrella bullshit that's fucking up everything.  What cowards, man.  That's not a horror.  Can't they ever say it's a guy's station and he said something?  Yeah, relax.  Just because it's owned by Disney?  All right.  So Disney should stay out of their fucking hair.  I mean, trailer park, that was such a knee-jerk reaction by someone.  You got to apologize.  Who?  I don't know. 
[00:37:30]  People live in those trailer parks, you know.  Earlier in the show, I made a comment about a fan at an Astros game that I should not have  said.  It was offensive, and it was inappropriate, and I sincerely apologize.  No, you don't.  Holy fuck, sucker.  Are you kidding me?  It's like you dropped an N-bomb with that.  That's an N-bomb apology.  What are you apologizing for?  We love the words inappropriate.  That's a real favorite now in the apologies.  My comments were inappropriate.  Offensive.  I said trailer park, that was inappropriate.  Earlier in the program. 
[00:38:00]  God, like horseshit.  It's a shitty word.  Inappropriate.  Yeah, inappropriate.  My comments.  Outrage is a famous one.  There's been outrage by someone's comments or remarks.  That apology should have been from this.  Earlier in the program, I said, rape is romantic, and that's offensive.  Right.  Earlier in the program, I said black people should return to change.  Right.  But I saw, which I know is offensive.  He said a fucking return to, what is it?  It's the trailer park.  Trailer park day.  The only discussion about this online is about, why did he apologize for it? 
[00:38:30]  Why?  Do you think it was someone, I'm sure someone told him to.  It's his boss.  He said, holy fuck, we're owned by Disney.  You've got to apologize immediately.  I sincerely apologize.  Sincerely.  What a guy's network that is.  Hey, guys!  Trailer park!  Hey!  Hey!  You calm down, you.  I find that offensive.  This is where the guys go to hang out.  Hey, guys!  What are you from the trailer park?  Hey! 
[00:39:00]  Get out of here, fella!  We don't need that kind of talk.  I don't like that.  That's a bit saucy.  Relax with that.  Hey, hey, whoa!  Family sports programming here, sir.  Ugh!  ESPN fucking stinks!  I haven't watched ESPN on a regular basis in probably a decade.  Terrible!  They're terrible.  What corn balls!  They're all corn balls, with their home run calls and their three-point shot calls.  You don't like Chris Berman?  What do they do?  He's a back, back, back guy.  He likes to say, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back. 
[00:39:30]  It could go all the way.  He was shoehorning it in last night.  But fairness to Chris Berman, he was unique and different.  Yeah.  And he started that whole fucking thing.  And then every guy on ESPN has to have their Chris Berman-isms.  They want to be the next Chris Berman.  Right.  Chris Berman's built a career.  So in all fairness, you know, if you had one guy that was like that, okay.  But now they're all forcing it.  But now everybody on the SportsCenter feels that they need to have...  But now Chris Berman's forcing all his catchphrases to...  Yeah, like last night...  I wouldn't even know because I honestly don't watch anymore. 
[00:40:00]  They're in the middle of conversations talking and somebody hits a home run and he's in mid-sentence  and he shoehorns it in as quickly as he can because the ball's already over the fucking wall.  But he's still got to say it.  Now, wasn't Oberman on ESPN?  Yes.  Okay, so they have a history of people who like to grovel and apologize publicly.  Well, Oberman...  That was before he went.  Yeah, that's a long time ago.  No, but he's still the same guy.  He was the same guy in the end of the years now.  Actually, I liked Oberman when he was on ESPN.  Yeah, in the ESPN book, there's a lot of stuff.  Wasn't Star Wars guy on ESPN?  Was he on...  What happened?  Was Star Wars guy on ESPN the one with the Star Wars frumpy girl? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, no.  Steve Phillips.  He's so nice to us.  He's here.  Yeah, he was on ESPN.  I know, I know.  He's such a nice guy.  Hey, look, I'm just kidding.  Look, we all know.  Come on, he knows.  I can't even look him in the eye.  Dude, he knows.  I know I can't.  He says hi every morning.  I know I can't look either.  I feel awful.  Was she a good fuck?  How bad do you want to have a conversation with him?  I would love to talk to him about that.  He's such a nice guy, though.  Oh, it's great.  Come on.  He's one of the nice people around here. 
[00:41:00]  There are a few.  That's simply my favoritest picture.  The worst picture of someone.  You'd never want people to know you fucked her.  It's fantastic.  Oh, jeez.  I wonder what she's up to these days.  Hopefully she's fucking sick.  I guess 420 pounds.  God, do I hate her.  She is a dumpy one.  She has a fucking fat girl little thing on her wrist, her awful shorts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And holding that phaser.  The little blaster with Darth Vader and a stormtrooper there.  I fucking wrecked this guy's life. 
[00:41:30]  Jimmy James in NH on Twitter writes, people in trailer parks need to get a sense of humor  or a better job.  No one in the trailer parks is complaining about what the guy said.  Where they got one call.  Where was that?  That's why this is so bad.  But I don't even think it resulted from a call.  Because we're going to call him 30 minutes later.  That's that preemptive hell.  We're on Twitter.  What is wrong with letting it go and seeing what happens?  Yep.  And then maybe you apologize.  Exactly.  I don't even agree with that.  You wouldn't have to. 
[00:42:00]  No one would have said anything about that.  And then we would get real entertainment.  Real guy entertainment on TV.  You don't think this is good guy entertainment?  Holy fuck.  It's a guy's network.  Have some beers.  Fucking for the guys come.  Hannah Storm dresses like a slut and a guy finally calls her out on it and he gets in  all that trouble.  Yeah, he got in trouble.  That's when I was like, I'm done with all this shit.  She wears tiny little short skirts and doesn't want anyone to comment or notice.  A woman's place is in the House and the Senate. 
[00:42:30]  I saw that bumper sticker once.  Oh, really?  Some dyke driving.  Was she dykey?  Oh, yes.  Give me the Hannah Storm clip again.  This one was the one that made me go, you know what?  Enough already.  It's a guy's network.  She dresses like a little fucking, you know, maybe not a, yeah, kind of slutty, to be honest  with you.  And a bit too old to be dressing like that.  And a guy finally calls her out on it and he gets in all sorts of trouble.  He almost was fired. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, well, yeah.  Look how she dresses.  And no one's supposed to comment about it?  No.  No, not on the guy's name.  Get the fuck out.  Come on.  This is where the guys come to hang out.  What's up, guys?  It's all equality.  You got it, E-Rock.  You got that shit.  I don't have it in here.  That's all.  We're going to find it on YouTube.  Yeah, you should be able to find it on YouTube.  Find it on YouTube.  You know.  I guess she's good at what she does, but she likes to dress overly sexy. 
[00:43:30]  And dress a lot younger than she is.  If she's really trying to dress short skirts and boots way the fuck up her legs.  Yeah, she's dressing because she wants men to want to fuck her.  Yeah, but as soon as you bring it up, as soon as you fucking comment on it, though, you're in trouble.  Right.  It doesn't work both ways.  That, to me, is insane.  We want honesty.  We like honesty.  Yeah, we started out with that honesty thing.  And I think you're right, Jimmy.  We don't actually want it in the end because we should be fighting for all this shit.  Right?  Look what happened to Reggie.  Yeah.  He was on it.  Here it is.  I want to point out, for those of you looking at ESPN, I'd like to point out Anna Storm in a horrifying, horrifying outfit today. 
[00:44:00]  She's got on red go-go boots and a Catholic school plaid skirt way too short for somebody in her 40s or maybe early 50s by now.  And she's got on her typically very, very tight shirt, so she looks like she's got sausage casing wrapped around her upper body. 
[00:44:30]  I mean, you know, honestly, I know she's very good, and I know I'm not supposed to be critical of ESPN people.  I'd point out that, you know, people who say that they lost 50 or 50 pounds have actually gained all the weight back.  Pause.  Pause.  I didn't know there was more to this clip.  This is great.  This guy is classic with this.  Tony Kornheiser is great.  They didn't fire him in the end, right?  No.  He barely made it through.  He had to apologize and all that.  And this was on his radio show.  It was on his radio show.  It wasn't even on ESPN. 
[00:45:00]  This is so fucking funny.  Back up, because now he talks about Chris Berman.  Remember Chris Berman did all those weight loss commercials?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He always went back.  Go ahead.  I know I'm not supposed to be critical of ESPN people.  I'll point out that people who say that they lost 50 or 50 pounds have actually gained all  the weight back.  Maybe some.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not supposed to do anything like that, so I won't.  But Hannah Storm today.  Put the weight back, back, back, back, back on.  Hannah Storm, right, Liz? 
[00:45:30]  Hannah Storm, come on now.  And you hit the highlights, the red go-go boots, the Catholic school.  It's a little more Burberry than Catholic school, but still appropriate.  It's a Lolita-esque quality, you know, appealing to the fantasy of the little, little.  Yeah, man.  Wow.  That is a very honest comment.  Oh, he tore her up from boots to the top of her head.  But that's how he feels.  It's so good.  He basically thinks she looks ridiculous dressing like that.  Much too short for a woman in a 40s and maybe early 50s. 
[00:46:00]  All he did did, he slammed her good.  But then he had to apologize.  You got the apology?  But she did look like an ass, didn't she?  She dresses like that all the time.  She dresses like a horse's patoot.  And finally someone called her out on it.  That was great.  Come on.  You got the apology somewhere?  It's a long clip.  What do you mean it's a long clip?  How long?  What the fuck happened to it?  15 minutes.  What?  15 minutes.  Well, I ain't going anywhere.  15 minutes.  Are you? 
[00:46:30]  Can't you find it?  There's not a shorter version?  If you find it.  What's the 15-minute?  Start the 15-minute clip, maybe.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Maybe it's at the beginning.  Maybe it's at the beginning.  How did you find it, you bag of shit?  I want to point out, for those of you looking at ESPN, I'd like to point out Hannah Storm  in a horrifying, horrifying outfit today.  Yeah.  She's got on a red go-go boots and a Catholic school plaid skirt, way too short for somebody 
[00:47:00]  in her 40s or maybe early 50s by now.  And she's got on her typically very, very tight shirt, so she looks like she's got sausage  casing wrapped around her upper body.  I mean, you know, honestly, I know she's very good, and I know I'm not supposed to be critical  of ESPN people.  I point out that people who say that they lost 50 or 60 pounds have actually gained all the  weight back.  Then some.  Yeah, I mean, I'm not supposed to do anything like that, so I won't, but Hannah Storm today. 
[00:47:30]  Put the weight back, back, back, back, back on.  Hannah Storm, right, Liz?  Hannah Storm, come on now.  It is painful, and you hit the highlights, the red go-go boots, the Catholic school.  It's a little more Burberry than Catholic school, but still inappropriate.  It's a Lolita-esque quality, you know, appealing to the fantasy of the little, little, well,  I don't, let's stop there.  Yes.  Well, but I would call a Holden Goldfield fantasy at that point.  Liz Clark is here, Gary Braun is here. 
[00:48:00]  So, maybe the apologies later on then or something, though, because that's, I want  to hear the apology, because it's a fake apology, obviously.  It has to be.  You don't talk like that, and then all of a sudden come to your senses and realize, oh,  I really do mean to apologize.  No, you don't.  Look, we've had to do the fake apologies.  We'll say it every time.  We had to.  If you ever hear an apology, it'll be fake.  We absolutely had to to save our fucking jobs.  Yeah, it'll just be a job saver.  Uh, the Stall Seat NY, uh, for their radio sponsors, ESPN runs a, ready for this, Jimmy? 
[00:48:30]  A guy's guy's weekend in Disney.  Yeah.  Guys, guys at Disney.  Yeah.  What do you think they do?  All right, if I talk sports.  At a guy's guy's weekend.  Guys, guys at Disney.  Yeah, if I do baseball, football stuff.  A guy's guy's weekend.  Yuck.  It's true.  But that's just not the way men talk.  What do you say, guys?  Let's go hit a small world ride. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  Come on, guys.  Yeah, that's it.  Let's talk baseball.  I need, I need an itinerary of the guy's guy's weekend.  Let's go on the Lilo and Stitch ride.  Try to shoot the little targets.  See who the biggest man is.  Shoot, I don't think there's guns involved in the guy's guy's weekend.  It's a little laser thing.  But I don't think part of the guy's guy's weekend in Disney.  So you're saying that even Disney is a little too incorrect, politically incorrect, for the guy's guy weekend?  I think it's a pretty soft guy's guy's weekend. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  I believe it falls a bit short.  Guys, guys.  Guys being guys.  Let's just go down there and be guys.  Yeah, come on, guys.  Let's toss the ball around, guys.  It includes a NASCAR racing experience, a baseball game.  Of course it does.  I mean, sports.  A baseball game.  Yeah.  Florida, go to a Marlins game or whoever plays by.  Who's the other team down there?  So you sit in a hot stadium?  I think the Braves have their spring training facility at Disney. 
[00:50:00]  So wait, you get to go around a racetrack?  They have a racetrack at Disney.  All right.  All right.  Can't really beat on that.  Go to a ball game.  Say some guy things.  Give me a couple of dogs while you're up.  A couple of dogs.  Come on, guys.  Play ball.  Talk like guys.  And then the Disney representative will be there.  Now, guys, two beer maximum.  Two beer maximum, guys.  Two beer maximum.  So you might want to spread them out.  Don't talk about the girls inappropriately. 
[00:50:30]  Don't say anything off color.  Okay, here it is.  Cool.  Let's see what the guys are doing.  Yeah.  A guys, guys weekend.  Come on, guys.  It includes round trip airfare for two.  Oh, wow.  Four day, three night.  What airline?  Guys Air.  G-U-I-Z Air.  Guys Air.  We're just going to be guys on this plane.  What is it?  So we don't comment on the flight attendants.  That's inappropriate.  It should be Hooters.  Didn't they have an airline for a while?  Hooters Air.  Hooters Air.  Right.  Yeah, they did.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  Guys Airline.  Probably serve guy food.  Yeah.  That's some cheesesteaks.  Head away down there, guys.  Let me have some nachos over here.  Let me get the baseball dog.  The baseball dog.  What are the guy things?  They fly down.  What else?  Four days, three nights, accommodation for two at Disney's Yacht Club Resort.  Oh, right.  That's where the guys go.  I'll stay there.  Play a couple rounds.  Yeah.  Jerk each other off.  Yeah, you know.  What guys do.  Not quite the most masculine guy place, I don't think. 
[00:51:30]  I don't know.  It's nice.  A welcome reception, which includes dinner, drinks, and fireworks.  Yeah.  Because guys like explosions.  We want it loud, don't we, guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Guys, we can boom, boom.  Just a bunch of guys standing around watching fireworks.  This stinks.  No, it's what guys do.  Go to the Yacht Club.  Here's some big booms.  Did you see that one?  Yeah, it was cool, guys. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  High five.  This is for guys.  It's a guys network.  Thank God there's a place where we can just be guys.  Yeah.  Leave the old ladies at home, right?  Guys, high fives.  Take a little vacation from the wives.  Yeah.  Watch some fireworks, boys.  Here's to being guys.  They're called old ladies.  Yeah.  Leave the old ball and chain at home.  That's right.  Yeah.  A drive-time night NASCAR racing experience at Richard Petty Racing. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, well.  Well, that's going to show us up a little bit.  Yeah.  That's all right.  Just to get faster in a car.  You're not going fast.  No.  No, you probably get to look at the cars where they're parked.  Kick the rims.  I imagine this thing.  Well, I don't even know where you'll let me.  You're kidding me?  I do 200 in this thing.  What do you think, guys?  Yeah, 200's good.  250 for me.  300 for me.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Give me a quick firework.  Wow.  We're guys.  We're guys. 
[00:53:00]  Optional 18 holes of golf.  Of course.  At Disney's Magnolia Golf Course.  You know what, guys?  I like playing golf, but guys like to do a lot more than just play golf.  It's always golf if you're doing a guy's thing.  And you comment on the drink girl that comes around with the car.  You comment on her ass.  You know what a real round of golf, if it's a guy's thing, you got the girls out there  in bikinis and the fucking beer fucking carts. 
[00:53:30]  Some of these places actually will have the girls topless and all that.  I played at that course.  It was an alligator on the fucking golf course.  It was pretty funny.  Alligators down there in Florida.  I putted a ball at him.  It was fun.  I just put a ball down and went, dunk, knocked it into him.  He didn't budge.  He didn't budge.  He's not the first one that's done it.  Yeah, I know.  That's it.  That's just it.  He's like nose.  And his skin is like armor.  Assholes.  He's just happy it's not a shoe or fucking purse.  Right.  Also includes a Saturday afternoon Atlanta Braves baseball game at the Champion Stadium at 
[00:54:00]  the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex.  Cool.  He's a kid with ESPN.  Cool.  And finally, this is the best part.  The Viva Los Guys Casino Night.  Yeah!  Oh, wow.  I got a sick show.  What do you want to do?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Play a little golf.  Saw the cars.  The explosion.  What a guys weekend.  Oh, yuck. 
[00:54:30]  You want a guys weekend?  How about this?  What are you guys doing?  We're going to go to the strip club in silk boxers and see who can cum in his pants.  We're going to call our wives cunts and then we're going to drink until we vomit on our  shoes.  That's a guys weekend.  We're going to tell racist jokes, get lap dances and cum in our pants.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  That's a weekend.  That's a guys weekend.  That's what you get when you get there.  You get fucking, like, the strip club money and new pairs of silk boxers. 
[00:55:00]  Why are you doing that?  Because you're guys.  You need friction.  You need her ass rubbing your cock really fast.  Oh, that makes sense.  That is a guys weekend.  Yep.  Does that work well?  The silk boxers?  Wow.  Well, there's a pair I ruined one time in New Orleans with Louis Ramey and Pete Correale  waiting for me outside.  I would assume that the silk would rub nicely.  You've never slid around in silk?  I've never owned silk boxers.  I used to always wear them.  How about silk sheets?  Nah. 
[00:55:30]  Holy fuck.  They're not very absorbent, silk sheets.  Yeah, but man, you turn over and you get hard.  If you use silk sheets and you have an episode in them, you have some sexploits in them  and you cum.  You throw them away.  You throw a couch away because of a booger.  No, but you'll be rolling around all night and you're still feeling that slimy wreck  instead of it soaking into the sheets.  I used to love silk boxers.  I flew with them once.  They're uncomfortable on a plane because you're trying to relax and you slide.  You slide down when they come up your ass? 
[00:56:00]  But I'm telling you, when you're getting a lap dance and you can fucking feel that ass  going...  And you have that fucking little bit of silky give.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a guy's weekend.  Interesting.  Uh, Sasher1975 says, uh, this sounds like a Jim Belushi sitcom.  Get away from the old 80s, guys.  Oh, it's always that.  Now you boys behave yourself.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, the old ball and chain doesn't know what a good time we're going to have.  They play around in golf.  Yeah.  You think they get home to their wives and they're like, oh, you don't even want to know. 
[00:56:30]  You don't even want to know.  What happens if Disney stays in Disney, let me tell you.  Oh, you guys in your fast cars and your fireworks.  Oh, we're guys.  We're guys.  Every guy who comes home after a guy's weekend should have to go to the pharmacy quietly.  That's a guy's weekend.  You have penicillin on the way out.  You get your drippy cock swabbed.  Because you had a guy's weekend. 
[00:57:00]  Bunch of fucking humiliated women on a bus going home.  Guy shit usually sucks.  It stinks.  Really?  Guys, come on.  When it's a free plan like this.  It's never guysy.  No.  You got Tony Kornheiser's apology yet?  No, I was reading.  How could I have gotten it?  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  You opened up another window.  This whole break we've been doing was just so you could find it.  We were just stalling there.  We were just biding our time.  Yeah, but you were having me read it.  Yeah, you read already.  Yeah, but you're sitting here having the time of your life enjoying a radio show that most people have to pay for. 
[00:57:30]  I think you read already.  You read it already.  Yeah, but how could I have looked for it while I was reading?  Well, after you're done reading, you move on.  Exactly.  You're not here to have the time of your life.  I realize this is a fun experience for everybody, but it's called employment, not enjoyment.  What about E-Rock finding it?  Well, he's too busy in there.  He's writing fan fictions.  E-Rock, what are you doing on a company time for?  Summer Slam's coming up.  And did Rob Cross get back to you? 
[00:58:00]  Yes, he did.  What did he say?  He wrote, I heard that.  Oh, Sam.  Yeah, I see what you did.  It changed just a little bit.  Hold on a minute.  We can't do two things at one time.  There's another, I couldn't look for, you had my computer on, too.  Oh.  That's an excuse after the fact.  Yeah, but it still counts.  That's true.  Thank you.  Well, have your own button over there.  Why the fuck do I have to push your stupid mind?  I can't design the stupid mind.  E-Rock, what did Rob Cross say?  Is he coming in to answer our phones?  He wrote, I heard that, followed by no. 
[00:58:30]  Oh.  Oh, he told you no.  What good is his internship?  That's not helpful at all.  What good is his internship, Sam?  Well, I don't know.  I think his internship is officially over.  He is an employee's.  But I think more, the big news here is you said, Rob Cross, do this.  And he said, Opie, no.  All right.  Damn.  He showed me, I guess.  I guess.  He certainly did.  I wouldn't have said no.  Got you.  Yeah.  Watch what I do next.  Oh, no.  That's why I wouldn't have said no. 
[00:59:00]  I'd throw a ball at him.  Ooh.  Why aren't you laughing, Sam?  I'm sorry.  I wasn't listening.  You didn't hear it, huh?  I was looking for the apology.  Didn't hear it.  Water doodles.  All right.  Where's the apology?  I was arguing why I hadn't found it.  I'm sorry.  I wasn't able to look for that.  What was that clip then?  A lot of excuses.  Well, I got to scan through this. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, Sam.  There's a lot going on over here.  Sam, what's going on?  Oh, Sam.  Talk amongst yourselves.  I heard Bob Backlund was on Raw last week.  He was.  How old does he look?  You know what?  He looks pretty good for his age.  What did he say?  He came out and did a quick run and match type thing.  Well, Vince, I just want to go and do some real wrestling  and give it 100%.  You know, this guy makes a good point.  He hung up, though.  Like, why would you go to a guy's weekend with your friend? 
[01:00:00]  It's for two.  So then you have to pick your best buddy.  Pick your buddy.  Your best buddy to go to the guy's weekend.  Here we go.  You think they're just sitting next to each other on a plane,  buckling up, looking and going, here we go.  It's crazy.  Here we go.  It's crazy.  Let the fun begin right here.  How sad is your life that you have to sign up for a guy's weekend at Disney?  Yeah.  Wouldn't you set that shit up with your pals on your own?  You'd think so. 
[01:00:30]  And really make it a guy's weekend?  Yeah.  I would take a free trip to Disney.  You would?  You would do the guy's weekend?  Oh, yeah.  In a second.  Well, Travis is a big Disney fan.  That's Bob Backlund?  Oh, no.  That's now?  Oh, yeah.  No, come on.  No, he don't look bad for fucking...  He's going to be 60.  Yeah, he looks great.  Nah, that can't be...  What?  Oh, my God.  How's he doing? 
[01:01:00]  Camo Clucks.  He looks great.  He stays in shape.  He's wearing those diaper shorts, though.  Yeah.  Is that his old wrestling shorts he had to put back on?  Sam is always...  Sam is very tricky.  He looks like this.  He always goes into wrestling somehow.  Jim brought it up.  What the fuck?  How old is he?  He's...  Yeah, he's in his 60s, I'm sure. 
[01:01:30]  Who's he fighting?  Heath Slater, the one-man rock band.  The one-man rock band.  Heath Slater's whole job is just jobbing out to watch.  Oh, would he do that knees thing?  Yeah, he did the knees walk.  That's so stupid.  Did he used to do that?  Oh, yeah.  That was his old shit.  That was his move.  I can't remember.  Does he take any fucking bumps?  Come on.  He fucking puts Heath Slater through the ringer.  Yeah, he does.  He looks fucking...  He'll be 63 next month.  I'll tell you, Backlund's a fucking anomaly in wrestling.  He looks amazing.  Yeah.  Do you think he looks better than Ric Flair? 
[01:02:00]  He's shaking hands in the ring.  Uh-oh.  He's wrestling.  Wrestling.  Oh, boy.  You can't even really call them shorts.  His wrestling underpants are really uncomfortable.  They're big diapers.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Cross-faced chicken wing.  Is that what he used to do?  I don't remember.  Wow.  Falls back on his back.  How does his spine not just shatter?  Holy shit.  He was doing real jujitsu shit.  He's got like a real neck hold on the guy.  Wow.  Look at him.  He's screaming.  He goes crazy.  He's nuts.  He probably stretched him out for real. 
[01:02:30]  What a mania.  Oh, no.  He's tapping.  Bob, he's tapped out.  He tapped out.  Wow.  Like his back room can only last two minutes.  Yeah, that's it.  That wasn't even two minutes.  I don't like his little energy.  He's got a lot of it for 63.  Yeah, he does have a lot of energy, man.  I'll take that energy at 63.  Fuck that.  Bob Backlund looks the same as he did fucking in 83.  Amazing.  Right up on the rope.  Kicking ass, too.  Look at him.  He's like a rip.  He's coming back.  I told you.  I've been saying Bob Backlund is coming back for that belt. 
[01:03:00]  You have been.  And he is.  I don't know if he is.  Thank God.  We should break because we've got a lot of guests today.  Oh, yes, we do.  I guess we're not going to get the apology.  Oh, well, we have to wait on that apology.  Wayne Knight.  Wayne Knight.  Newman from Seinfeld.  Brian Cranston and Aaron Paul in studio for Breaking Bad.  Sunday, right?  Yeah, this Sunday.  I've already seen the first two episodes.  Spoiler alert.  No, I won't.  And Elijah Wood.  Nice. 
[01:03:30]  For season two of Willard.  Or Wilford, I'm sorry.  Wilford.  Wilford turned out to be a good show.  Yeah.  So he's coming in to promote season two?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  All right, then.  Okay.  Let's eat.  All right.  I'm going to eat.  All right.  Sorry.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Hey, kids.

Doesn't that sound fun?  Yay!  Guns can be very dangerous, especially to little people who don't like hole-shotting them,  or to birds on deserted islands who thought the nice sailors only wanted to be friends. 
[01:04:30]  But that's another story.  Derek will teach the kids what to do if they find a gun around the house.  What do we do first?  We pick it up.  Second?  Check is loaded.  Right.  Because we don't want any nasty accidents.  So look down the barrel and...  Pull the trigger.  Ah, true.  Yep, it's loaded, Henry.  And you made a mess.

[01:26:30]  You went three years  And you had nothing  To split  Nothing  No kids  No kids  No house  No assets  You didn't even really have a car  That was worth splitting  I had a job  That they figured  She was entitled to  Future earnings of  And an apartment  That was it  And an apartment  And Tom Cruise  Gets it done  In basically one day  Yep  The announcement came  What a week ago  Maybe at this point  So within a week  He's done  Within a week  He's done  She got a fortune  To shut her mouth  Is what I'm thinking 
[01:27:00]  Happened there  Well you gotta think  You wanna hear a peep out of her  He didn't fight for his kid  So you gotta think  You know  There's some shit going down  Behind closed doors  Because she got  She got custody of the kid  There's no joint custody  Basically she has the kid  You're right  And he'll come around  Every once in a while  That's the deal he got  As Tom Cruise  Because she knows  A lot of shit  She probably has to  Shut up about Scientology  About Tom Cruise  They probably wrote up  A nice big contract  How about this  He can't talk about religion  In front of his kid 
[01:27:30]  When he is with her  Oh yeah  That was part of the settlement too  Was it  Oh fucking yeah  How do they know  What was part of the settlement  Like who fest  These things are usually  Ultra confidential  Sign sealed  And almost delivered  Lawyers for the actor  Said today  They've hammered out a deal  Accepted by both  The Top Gun  And Dawson Creek stars  No details of the custody agreement  Were made public  Well that's bullshit  It's all over the news  That she got custody  Team effort 
[01:28:00]  Cooperation  All those catch words  Oh yeah  Here you go  Radar Online reported  This afternoon  That Holmes will have  Primary custody  Of their daughter  Surrey  Six  While Cruise will enjoy  Visitation rights  Holmes  Nanny and bodyguards  Will reportedly be with Surrey  During her visits  With the  With the Taps dad  They've brought out Taps  Yeah  Jesus Christ  It's like one of his movies  They gotta do that  They gotta do that  But they could have used  Any other movie  There's something going on 
[01:28:30]  Why Taps?  They should have said  Something like  Katie Holmes realized  That the mission  Was indeed impossible  But it doesn't make sense  Of course not  They didn't need the word Taps  And it was  That was more  Timothy Hutton  And Sean Penn  There's something  Fucking weird  Movie was good  Going on  Why would their bodyguards  Be allowed to be with him  During visitation  He got  He  He doesn't want some shit  To come out  But everyone else  In the entertainment business  Will make believe  This was a real marriage  What the fuck is going on 
[01:29:00]  That's weird man  Cruise will also  Listen to this  He got  He fucking gave up  Everything to protect  Wherever the fuck  We'll just say it that way  Whatever the fuck  He wants to protect  Cruise will also be barred  From talking about  His Scientology faith  With Surrey  And the bodyguards  And the nannies  Are gonna be checking  They're gonna be around  Surrey is Katie's  Number one priority  Tom only has Scientology  Scientologists that work for him  And Katie insisted  That her staff  Will always be with their daughter  Holy fuck  Oh because she doesn't want  Just a bunch of 
[01:29:30]  You know how fucking  Annoying Scientology  Must be for that  For that woman  Who was that close to it  To react that way  Yes  Exactly  She doesn't want those people  Around a fucking kid  According to the settlement  Surrey isn't permitted  To be exposed to anything  Scientology related  And this includes  Going to any Scientology  Churches  Parties etc  Katie made sure  That this was  Ironclad in the  In the agreement  She hates Scientology  Wow  But she is not  Taking an ounce  Of fucking shit  No  Well something bad 
[01:30:00]  Is gonna happen to her  Let's go  Let's be the first  To be on record  Oh you're saying  That Scientology  I don't know  I don't know  It's like  No I love Scientology  They've been fucking  Terrific  They've been great  Wow that's weird though  Tom Cruise  Gave up basically  Everything to get out  Of that marriage  Yeah  That's funny  Someone  Someone twittered me  Sorry  I bet Surrey isn't  Tom's kid  Elrond's sperm  Was used  Oh god  Somebody twittered  Oh that they froze  A bunch of Elrond's sperm  Elrond Hubbard 
[01:30:30]  Is that possible  Oh I don't know  How long ago  Did he die  20 years ago  30 years ago  Yeah  Man  I don't know  Katie Holmes  She looks good  She looks great  I've always liked her  She's alright man  Yeah  Tomcat  Tomcat  They call  That's over  No one  No one would give up  Their kid like that  In a divorce  No  This is  It's so obvious 
[01:31:00]  Yeah it has to be obvious  Cause this all went down  In a week  You would think  This would drag on  Just cause he wants  To try to get  You know  Better visitation rights  With his own child  I bet Scientology  People came to him  And said  Hey you squash this  Right now  You need to squash this  Something happened  I bet you  Divorces don't  Get fucking finalized  In a week  No  Where she's getting  Everything  When you're a guy  Tom Cruise  Is a lot more powerful  Than she is in Hollywood  Yeah  Right  Cause I can only imagine  The amount of money  She's getting too  She's getting  A lot of money 
[01:31:30]  She gets her kid  And the church thing  She's like a crazy person  When it's on TV  Maybe they're afraid  That she  Because she was married  To the biggest Scientologist  She can do a lot more damage  To them  Than anybody  Oh yeah  If she wants  On TV  Cause people will listen to her  So Tom Cruise  Used the kid basically  Said look  I'll give you the kid  But you're gonna sign  A lot of fucking papers today  Yeah  You know  Maybe  Where she ain't gonna  She'll never talk  She'll never be allowed  To talk about this  She'll never talk 
[01:32:00]  And now it's worth it  To Tom Cruise  To give up his  His  His own child  For that  Wow  Sacrificing for his religion  Hollywood  Is that important to you Tom  That's even more than that  I think  It's just  He's one of these guys  I think  I guess he's that dedicated  That he's  He's that dedicated  To Scientology  That he's comfortable  With not just having  His kid by himself  Giving up  He's basically  Giving up his kid  It really is  Like some kind of  Fucking cult  I mean a woman  Is gonna get the kid anyway  It's crazy  But to have to have  Her staff there  Yeah  How do you as Tom Cruise 
[01:32:30]  Allow that  Allow that  Unless you know  You're getting something  In return  That's  She knows a secret  She knows a secret  You think so  Oh fuck yeah  You think  You couldn't possibly  Have gone down like  Look  I know what we signed  Five years ago  Yeah  I don't care  Yeah  I will go  And say it to everybody  Sue me  Yep  What are you gonna do  Yeah  And almost like  If you know something  About somebody 
[01:33:00]  And you've signed on  To confidentiality  And you go out  And just fucking  Blab it to the media  She could ruin him  You can get sued  But the damage  You can do to that person  Is worse  Yep  She could ruin him  Yeah  Cause all the lawsuits  In the world  Can't make people  Unhear it  I bet he's more  Of a fucking weirdo  Than he even  Comes across on TV  And he comes across  As a fucking weirdo  A little odd guy  I bet he is just  A strange motherfucker  Yeah  Hmm  Well 
[01:33:30]  I took three years  That was good  Three years over nothing  Three fucking years  You got done in a week  Misery  Let's call it a week  Okay  It's Newman  Newman's over there  He looks pretty good too  When is Newman gonna be over here  He lost a lot of weight  From the time he was  Wow  He was Newman  He looks pretty much  The same  Yeah  Oh  No why  I don't even want to say why  They're showing a clip  From his new show  And I thought it was  A Seinfeld  No but I'm looking at him  On the news though  And he does 
[01:34:00]  I'm looking at his face  I thought they were just  Showing an old Seinfeld clip  That was pretty funny  He's dragging the dog  Yeah  He's funny man  He's way funnier  Than Jason Alexander  Excellent  He's very funny  Jason Alexander's  Not a funny guy  They wrote funny  He was funny on the show  They wrote funny for him  I can't stop  He knew how to act funny  I can't stop following him  On Twitter  He's good right  And I wish I could  He's good  He's real good right  Jason Alexander is  Probably the worst tweeter ever  It's just not like  It's not George 
[01:34:30]  He's not George  Larry David's George  The kid is not Tom Cruise's  That is why he doesn't have custody  Oh  Is that what they're saying  Well in California  She would get  Cause she's a competent mother  She's rich  She's rich without Tom Cruise  Yes  So she's gonna get cussed anyway  But I wonder if that's a big piece of it  Maybe that makes sense  If it wasn't his  If it was somebody else's sprain  She looks  That kid looks just like  Fucking Katie Holmes though

[01:49:00]  Newman from Seinfeld  How about Wayne Day  Save it  Save it  And the X's I guess it's called  Wednesday 10pm on TV Land  His new sitcom  TV Land  I like that station  You like it huh  Yeah there's good stuff on there  Yes  What  I swear  I watch it  You get to talk to Newman today  Well  Do you watch Hot in Cleveland  Or whatever that show is called  But you can't just  No I don't  Is that a TV Land show  Yeah the Betty White show 
[01:49:30]  Oh  I hear Regis is terrific on that  Is he  I hear  Some kind of swinging guy  I don't know  He's a swinger  You can't just talk to him  About Newman though  How about JFK  JFK  What was Castner like  He was in that  I think the strategy is to  Interview him  About his current project  But just  Using Seinfeld  Bombard him  With the inside Seinfeld  Oh beautiful  Just Shatner him  When you just  Start talking about the man  On the plane  That is true  Beautiful  I could do that 
[01:50:00]  But just a lot of it  Like a lot  Yeah yeah  Just pound him  And then more importantly  We got the Breaking Bad guys  Coming in  Whoa  That's at 915  Brian Cranston and Aaron Paul  You don't need to rank the guests  What?  You don't need to rank the guests  That show is huge  And then somewhere in the middle  Is Elijah Wood  Elijah Wood's coming in too  No he's last  But he's  You know  As far as the importance goes  Can I rank the importance  Of our guests today?  One of the hugest fucking  Epic trilogies ever made 
[01:50:30]  That is true  I'm going to go  I'm going to go  Brian Cranston and Aaron Paul  From Breaking Bad  Our most important guests today  Oh man  You can't rate the fucking guests  It's a bad idea  It's bad  I'm going to go with  Elijah Wood second  Oh man  The Lord of the Rings thing  You know  It's a few years  No but he's been  The upcoming Hobbit  Oh he might have to be  Above Brian Cranston  And Wayne Knight  Wayne Knight  Come on  That's Seinfeld  He's a distant third  The  Arguably 
[01:51:00]  One of the biggest sitcoms  You know what  I just put them into a database here  They are tied for first  It's a three way tie  For first most important  Wow  So congratulations  To all of our guests  Very good  Rate the guests  Who would you put  In third place today?  Okay  They're all important people  Sam  Alright look  Third place  Yes  I have to go  Be fair  I'm going to be fair  Okay  I honestly have to go 
[01:51:30]  With Elijah Wood  Third place?  In third place  Why?  Why?  Because  You didn't like  Lord of the Rings?  No  No I loved  Lord of the Rings  I loved it  The Good Son  I still watch it  The Good Son  Very good Sam  Fucking Back to the Future 2  Right  Third place though  Pepsi Commercial  I got to  It's just  You know  Wilfred is not as big as Seinfeld  Well that's true  It might be at some point  But we're not talking about  Their latest projects  Exclusively 
[01:52:00]  Overall I'm just saying  Look  It's third  Alright  Now next  This is going to be tough for you  You love Breaking Bad  And we all know you love Seinfeld  I am huge Seinfeld  You know what?  I got a reasoning here  Since we got two  This is Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul  I'm going to have to go  With them being number one today  And Wayne Knight  A very very close second  For this  Yeah  Yeah 
[01:52:30]  So that's my rating  That's a good rating  Yeah  Can't wait  What's the matter?  Uh oh  Why Jimmy?  Oh no Jimmy  There's something bad  It's not bad  He just pushes him in the car 
[01:53:00]  He just pushes him in the car  Or just get in the motherfucking car  Or just get in the motherfucking car  From used cars obviously  Because Frank McCray  Who plays Jim  He's a big black dude  In a red suit jacket  And he opens the door  And is looking into it  And the guy is standing  And he is standing  On the other side of the door  And he just physically 
[01:53:30]  He grabs him  And he just fucking  He does manhandle him  Manhandles him  And muscles him into the car  God I love this  I hear Wayne Knight is here  Oh no  Alright Bill Burr  To break  Let's go  No you know what I like  Is when you go into these places  Right  Even when they're getting your money  Like that's not enough for them  They want to suck  Like more information out of you  When I bought toiletries  The other day  They asked me for like  My phone number  I'm ringing it up  They're like  Can we have your phone number?  No  Well Sarah  We're not going to do anything with this 
[01:54:00]  Really?  You're just collecting numbers  Just for the fuck of it  You idiot  No  You can't have my phone number  Then they get like  All freaked out  Right  Well Sarah  I have to put something in  If I don't  If I don't input something in  I can't get to the next  What do I do?  Well fucking lean on the keyboard  Sweetheart  I don't know what to tell you  Stick your finger on the one  There you go  That's my phone number  155-689  That's it  We have an area code  123  Very exclusive neighborhood  Oh it's the worst 
[01:54:30]  You have our little  Savey save  Fucky fuck card  No  No I don't  Would you like one?  No  I wouldn't  Well why not?  Because you're up to something  I don't know what you're up to  But I know you don't want to  Make less money  Alright  Stop fucking with me  Just ring this up  And let me get on with my life  Evidently what you're doing  Is you're giving them  A free survey  On what products  You can't live without  So they can jack the price 
[01:55:00]  Of that up  Under the guise  Of giving you like a nickel  Off of like  Bootleg Froot Loops  That's basically  I read it on the internet  It's gotta be true  Right?  It's gotta be  Sirius XM  And now  The Opie and Anthony Show  A little frightening  How cool is this  Wayne Knight in studio  Very  I was looking at my phone  I look up  And there's Wayne Knight  Yeah that's how I do it  When did you enter?  You snuck right in  I slipped right in the back door 
[01:55:30]  This is how my career  Has been that way  Slid right in  Right into your seat there  Sir  Wayne's back on TV  Huh?  The X's  Yeah you know what happens  Yeah  The X's on TV land  They've allowed me back  On the television  Probably one of the most  Recognizable faces  On television  One of them for sure  You know I don't know  If that's good or bad  But yes thank you very much  I bet it's good  I bet it's good  It doesn't hurt  Except how many times a day  Do you hear it?  How many times?  You know I just heard it a lot 
[01:56:00]  On Fox News  Did you?  Oh god no  Newman Newman Newman Newman Newman  Oh my god  See we're trying not to do that  People must say that though  All the time  It's just  Well yeah  But I mean  You know my wife  Never gets used to it  But I've gotten used to it  Because it just means  That you've done something  That people like  That is true  Some people can embrace  A character like that  And others kind of  Have a problem with it  I know like  Like Mr. Spock  Had a problem  But you know what  He wrote a sequel book  That nobody talks about  Which is  I Am Spock  I Am Spock 
[01:56:30]  Yeah  Which is like  You know  He owned it  He wrote the one  That was I Am Not Spock  When he was a little  Kind of like  Hey enough with the Spock thing  Yeah but I mean  You know what are you going to do  Like wrestle everybody  Who says that to you  To the ground  And I paint  I draw  You know  Whatever  Yeah yeah  Put on the pointy ears  And shut up  Come on  Would you rather talk about  Seinfeld or JFK  Oh JFK  Well JFK was quite a  Horrifying experience  Doing that movie  Why was it  Because I was like 
[01:57:00]  5,000 pounds  And it was in New Orleans  Oh wow  I was rendering  The entire time  I had to wear  A three piece  A wool three piece suit  Wow  And you know  I quit smoking  And they said  Well you know  This is 1962  And 63  And 65  So everybody smokes  So I said  Well can you give me  Those herbal cigarettes  They went  Sure sure sure  We'll give you  Those herbal cigarettes  And then about  Three weeks in  Oliver said  No make them smoke  So  That's nice  I'm right back at it 
[01:57:30]  You know  Did it take you back  Because I quit smoking too  And I've always wondered  Do you go back to smoking  If you smoke in a roll  Instantly  Instantly  I'm chewing tobacco  I'm wearing patches  I'm smoking  I'm rolling in tobacco  Oh you go right back  How much longer  Did you smoke after that  What's today  I think another 15 years  I don't know  Oh shit  Wow  You have Oliver Stone  To thank for that  Yeah  God bless you 
[01:58:00]  What a guy  Well you  Yeah you took care of yourself  You lost a lot of weight  Well I mean since then  I'm about 75 down from there  Yeah  But you know  It's up  It's down  It's whatever  You look good though  I mean you look  We were watching you  On the news too  You look exactly the same  Which is great  Well  Of course  I've had a lot of work done  No I haven't  The good thing about  Being a real porker  When you're young  Is that as you get older  You don't look any worse  You know  So people  Everybody else goes to hell 
[01:58:30]  And you look pretty much the same  That's great  You took lemon  And made lemon meringue pie  So what is  What's the exes about  It's about 22 minutes long  And no  It's about three guys  And a divorce lawyer  And the divorce lawyer  Is probably not so good  Because these guys  Are like in middle age  Or thereabouts  And they're having to be  Roommates across the hall  From their divorce lawyer  So there are three guys  Who've crapped out  In their divorces  And they're in a nice 
[01:59:00]  Apartment in New York  But they have to share it  With each other  And the divorce lawyers  Across the hall  Yes  Kristen Johnston  Goddamn divorce lawyers  Yes  I'm not a fan  Is anybody here  On their first marriage  God bless you  All three of them  You just raised your hand  You got married  Like a week ago  Three of us  Four of them  That's fantastic  How many are you up to  Two  And that's the last one  That's it  I vowed never  I vowed never to get  Married again  Well yeah  I mean there is 
[01:59:30]  That sentiment  Yeah  Yeah  But then I just  Met somebody  I really  You did not have  To give away  Some of that  Seinfeld money  Did you  Oh I didn't  Give it away  Oh no  It was taken from me  It was wrenched  From my cold  Dead man  Oh no  Oh  It's like look  Jerry wasn't saying  Hello to you  Every time the door  Opened  And then my career  Immediately went to the  Toilet  It's like  Thank you  Goodbye  I went through  Like the same thing  I had to give away 
[02:00:00]  Money during the best  Years of my career  And then it's like  Your divorce lasted  How many years  Three years  Of going to court  And going through  Three years  Didn't have kids  Didn't have any  Property or anything  It was just the fact  That you know  My future was  In the stars  Oh my god  The way the lawyer  Was talking about it  Well no  Luckily my ex  Was we mediated  And whatever  Because she knew  That I probably  Wouldn't get another job  So it was alright  She didn't have any faith  That I was going to 
[02:00:30]  Continue on  The business  Oh that Seinfeld  What year did you get divorced  How long  Was it after Seinfeld  Or was it in the middle of it  It was right as  It was ending  Oh wow  Wow  Oh you must have been like  Oh  No it was after  I don't remember  Yeah  I just  It's just a blur  Yeah I hear you  It's a blur  And you know  But she got the bad dog  So it's alright  Oh good okay  It's alright  I got the good dog  It's fine  So I guess your characters  In the exes  Are all divorced  Yeah  And so  What are you like 
[02:01:00]  Are you dating on the show  Yeah  I'm not  Yeah sure  That's you know  Let's get Wayne Knight  And have him date  You know  That's the first thing  That comes to people's mind  We want to see him have sex  Well  You never know  You never know  It could happen  It could happen  It's a comedy  My character is named  Haskell Lutz  And basically  They had this couch  And they thought  We could have somebody  Sitting on that couch  Why not Wayne Knight  Alright  In fact that's even 
[02:01:30]  How it was pitched to me  And I'm like  Perfect  Is there nothing else  To the characters  Like well we're not sure  We know about the couch  You sit on a couch  That's it  You know  That's nice  You're part of the scenery  Right  So it could be like  The actor J.C. Flippin'  I don't even need  The use of my legs  In order to do the part  Which is very good  That's  Well you're a familiar face  Everybody knows that  Yes  Yeah  Were you a stand-up first  Or did you just  You started that acting  Well when I came to New York  In like 77  And I immediately went 
[02:02:00]  To catch  And to do the improv  To just sit down front  And laugh hard  And look  You know  And I realized  That my testicles  Were just a little too small  To do stand-up  I had done stand-up  Once in the south  At a place called  The Silver Saddle Lounge  In Bogart, Georgia  Wow  In the middle of my set  They turned on the jukebox  And started clogging  Literally  And I said  Maybe not  So I was in groups  I did improv  And group stuff 
[02:02:30]  Sketch comedy  But I never had  The nuts to do stand-up  What was your first  Do you remember  Your first audition?  No  Frankly no  Another blur  Yeah  I mean  I came  Out of college  I got a  Equity card  At a regional theater  Doing an internship  I did two years  At an internship  At the Barter Theater  In Virginia  Got my card  Came to New York  And then  I didn't have an agent  I saw a play 
[02:03:00]  On Broadway  I said  I can replace that role  I went backstage  Handed the stage manager  My picture and resume  Which was all bogus  At the bottom of the resume  It said  Unafraid to consume new products  You know  I was like  There was nothing  On the resume  Nothing  They called me in  Like six months later  I auditioned for it  I got it  It was  This play Gemini  I did it for three years  So  I didn't really have  And I thought  Well once you're on Broadway  You're going to go  Go go  No  No huh  No I crapped out 
[02:03:30]  And waited tables  And became a private investigator  For five years  You were an investigator  Did you have a license?  No  The place was licensed  I was an agent of  I had an ID  And I didn't have a carry license  Or anything like that  I just was  You know  A lot of videotaping  Compensation cases  Mostly doing background checks  And you know  Some marital stuff  And some this and some that  You know  And I thought  Well people will recognize me  From my butcher's blend dog food commercial 
[02:04:00]  I don't know  I better not  Yeah  I better not hit the streets  I don't know  So you would follow people  And videotape them  Yeah but no  There wasn't a lot of videotaping  In those days  You know  It was just  It was like courtroom sketches  It was very early  I had to draw them  Here he is  Picking up something very heavy  When he said his back hurt  The car isn't quite right  But you know  You get the gist  Just stick figure in the box  And ouch written over  Exactly 
[02:04:30]  No but it's interesting to me  The private investing  Because now it's like  So easy to get information  You Google or whatever  Yeah yeah yeah  But it's like wow  What was that like 85  You're talking  Something like that  This is this is like  Yeah something  I mean in the  Yeah because I crapped out  I did the show  79 to 83 or whatever  And then about that time  So about 82, 83  And we have a room  Full of phone books  You know  Because there wasn't  Any Google or whatever  And you would go  Through phone books  From all over the country  Try and  This thing called  Cold's Directory 
[02:05:00]  Trying to get cross referencing  And stuff like that  Oh my god  What a pain in the ass  And you'd call neighbors  And ask them questions  About their neighbor  And say  Hey I'm a  My Uncle Jim's  Locked me out of the house  Oh right right  Come up with some story  Yeah  You were like Mannix  Yeah you would do this  Like under a suitable pretext  I asked the subject  Did you not act at all  For that five years  No no no  I did a series  In England  I did this sketch comedy show  In England  With Emma Thompson  And came back  Went back to work 
[02:05:30]  As a PI  Because my father  Had this weird work ethic  Where I didn't feel good  About being on unemployment  I'm like the only actor  In America  I was on unemployment  So I would  I would go back to work  Yeah  Oh wow  How did you  Now how did you get  The Seinfeld gig  Because I mean  People that are fans  Of the show  Kind of know that  This Newman character  Was brought up early  In the show  But it really wasn't you  Right  Or that character  It was just a voice  Really  It was just Larry David's voice  Yeah  Yeah 
[02:06:00]  And so I had moved out to LA  Done Dead Again  And JFK  And whatever  And I was out in LA  And just a standard audition  You're like  Calling all fat people  Calling all fat people  You know  So we're in a room  You know  Several of them  Are dying  As we're going  I'm saying  I'm moving up in line  And I just came in  And did the audition  And it was the episode  Where the question was  How long do you wait  While a guy's in a coma 
[02:06:30]  To hit on his girlfriend  Yes  And I was the building snitch  That's how they created  The character  And I was going to tell  On Jerry  For hitting on  The girlfriend  When the guy came out  Of the coma  And they bought me off  With a Drake's cake  Right  So that's the episode  And we're just sitting there  Love that  Michael and I are sitting  Next to each other  And it's like the scene  From the 1939 World's Fair  You know  You got this big round sphere  And a tall thin spike  And they thought  This is kismet 
[02:07:00]  You know  And I just kept coming back  How many years were you on?  I was seven out of nine  And I gather  That wasn't supposed to be  A recurring character  No  When you first went on  It was a one off  And they tried to keep it that way  As long as possible  Wow  Did they?  I'm like  We need you Thursday  No  Maybe not  But you don't understand  People in the bathroom  Are calling me Newman  And I  Shouldn't you pay me? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah  Because  Did you know during the  And I'm sure everybody  Asked this  But did you know  During the show  That it was going to be  Something so huge?  Well you know  I don't think anybody  Could know  That it was going to be  I mean  Because what happened  Is after the show ended  It crossed over  In a way  That people who  Wouldn't watch the show  You know  I was getting mail  From Muslim people  In Yemen  Like we love it  You know  And you're like  Why?  Why do you love it?  You know  But  You knew that it was  Really really good  You sat down at the table  When you're doing 
[02:08:00]  A table read  And you go  Shit this is really good  Yeah  And it felt  Kind of like a  Broadway opening  Every time you're doing  A show  You had great guest stars  And everything is tight  And really well written  So  Yeah  The writing on that show  It really did kind of  Reinvent the sitcom  Yeah  In that the writing  Was so good  The acting was great  Well they call that  They don't even call it  A multi-camera  I mean  What that was  Was a hybrid  Because we would do  Some stuff outside  And some stuff  You know  And you had so many scenes 
[02:08:30]  And they all dovetail together  And were stitched together  At the end  Yeah  And it was like  You know  Intricate kind of  Chinese box  Yeah  All those different stories  Larry David really is a genius  At telling a story  And making two stories  Tie into one  He really is brilliant  I saw some of the  Some of the gag reels  And stuff  And they're  Unbelievably funny  But was  Was Michael  He seemed very serious  When it came to people  Laughing on set  I know there's a  Michael was kind of like  A physicist who just 
[02:09:00]  Stumbled in  Oh really  You know  You're like  Hello sir  He was just  He just worked differently  Because you'd see people  Laughing their asses off  Trying to get through a scene  And he looked genuinely mad  That  You know  Let's go  Let's work this  Well he liked  You know  It was very funny  Because he liked doing  The block and shoot stuff  Without the audience  And he became  A totally different animal  With an audience  I mean  He was  Probably five times better  With an audience  Than he was  Wow really 
[02:09:30]  Because it just  Kind of sparked  The danger in him  And he would take leaps  You know  Physically and stuff  Into an audience  That he wouldn't do  As well otherwise  But he didn't particularly  You know  Enjoy the experience  Yeah  Wow that's something  I have a question  About Jurassic Park  What exactly did they use  To blast you  This is one of the most  Horrifying moments  Of my life  Thanks for bringing it up  You know  There's a guy  Who lives across the street  From me  In California now 
[02:10:00]  Who was the guy  Who shot me in the face  He's got a nicer house  Than I do  That guy  Really pisses me off  He's a special effects guy  Yeah  He worked for Stan Winston's team  And so they had  Several different things  That they shot me with  They shoot me  With this petroleum distillate  From long range  With like a rifle  Kind of thing  That hits me in the shoulder  Then they hit me  With this stuff  Called methicill  Which is the sticky  Goopy  You pull it away  From your body 
[02:10:30]  And it looks like  You know  Alien kind of goop  Right  And then  On the close up  On the turnaround  They shot me  With an air rifle  Filled with dyed black  KY jelly  Oh wow  In between my eyes  And they said  Look  Here's how it's going to work  You can't blink  Because if you do  We're going to just  Keep doing it  Take after take  After take  Wow  And I'm like  Okay  And they shoot me  And then Spielberg says 
[02:11:00]  You know that scream  You did  We kind of need  A PG scream  Instead of an R scream  I said  It was just  What came out  Just a normal scream  What's the difference  To the PG and an R  The blood curdling scream  You just do  A kind of a blood  Warming scream  It's  I don't know  Wow  But  The dye black  KY jelly  So I'm doing  Seinfeld at the time  And  I'm coming in  And they said  You know  You've got a big  Purple stain on your head  I said  What  He says  Yeah  This is a big stain  So they had to 
[02:11:30]  Like put cake  Makeup on me  You know  I came back  To Jurassic  I said  Hey  You know  The thing you used  To shoot me in the face  It dyed my face purple  And he says  Yeah  It'll do that  It's like  Hey  I'm doing a show  Wow  And were you amazed  Because it really is well shot  And when you see it  Like obviously on the set  You're looking into a camera  You're not looking  At anything frightening  How unscary was it  Shooting it  Compared to when you  Finally saw it put together  Well  The one thing is that  This is 
[02:12:00]  Kind of about the cusp  Of CGI meets  You know  Animatronics  And so  Winston's crew  Was making  The spitter  Was actually a giant puppet  That  There  We shot that part  Of it at Universal  On the biggest soundstage  At Universal  So the  The water coursing  The jeep  Trapped  The me in the jungle  All of it's there  Oh wow  And the operators  Are beneath the floor  Operating the spitter  So his fan  Is like  And so 
[02:12:30]  It was easy to act to  And  And also  You know  This is the biggest thing  I'd ever done  And I knew  That if I fucked it up  It was bad news  So I was scared  Yeah  Yeah  It looked like  A fun scene though  I don't know why  It looked like  A fun scene to do  It's like  You're on a set  Because you know  It's a set  But it just looked  Like a fun place  To be shooting  And it was  Kind of a comical thing  It was comical  But the thing is  That they have  These things  Of non-potable water  You know  Like the kind of water  That you use  At a golf course  In you know 
[02:13:00]  Saudi Arabia  Or something  I don't know  They cleaned the  Lincoln Tunnel with it  Yeah  I don't know where  The water came from  And it's like  All these signs  Do not drink  Non-potable water  Don't drink the water  And they're all  Wearing rain gear  And masks and shit  And I'm just out there  You're there  Just pouring me down  This water  And I'm sliding down  A hill  And face down  Into the water  And it wasn't  So much fun  Yeah  But I'm sure  You didn't complain  No  Not for a Spielberg movie  No  But I did  At one point  They had me  Surrounded by food  You know  And I said  Do you think 
[02:13:30]  They're going to think  I got this way  From deep breathing  I mean do we really  Need this many  Ho-ho's  You know  And Spielberg said  Hey look  Let's do it my way  This time  Next time  We'll do it your way  Oh man  We know that  Never worked with him again  Oh man  Wow  I think somebody  On the set  At E.T.  Said we'll understand  It without the finger  Glowing  Yeah I know  Exactly  Exactly  That was  That Jurassic Park  Scene is one of those  It's very nerve wracking 
[02:14:00]  To watch that one  Like  Because  Especially when you  Hit that sign  And you just spin it  Because you don't  Quite know where  The dock is  It's very like  But there is a  Comic element to it  Yeah  Even though it's horrific  You know  You get horrifically  Ripped apart  At the end of it  Well but see  The one good thing  About that movie  Is that everybody  Who dies  You don't mind  Them dying  That's true  Yeah  They had to make  Sam Jackson  A smoker  You know  Because if  So a smoker  You can kill  A lawyer you can kill  You know 
[02:14:30]  A glutton  You can kill  Right  Right  You know  You can't kill kids  You can't kill  Decent people  But those people  You know  You can kill  That's interesting  Is that really  A thought like a smoker  Like it's easier  To kill off in a movie  I never made a connection  Like that  I guess psychologically  People think  While they're behaving  You're okay with that  Yeah  Yeah  You have less  You know  Because he was smoking  In every shot  Right  Yes  Yeah  Right up to the filter  But that's  Who thought that out  And noticed that  And psychologically said  That's easier for an audience  To swallow 
[02:15:00]  To handle  Yeah  Like they must have  That's probably Steven  I mean the idea of like  You know  What I think he wanted  In some ways  I don't know  But it was to paint  In a broad brush stroke  So that you didn't do  A lot of thinking  That you knew  Who these characters were  When you saw them  And then you get on  With the action  Yeah  You didn't really need  A lot of development  As far as that goes  Yeah  Your character was great  It was very  And early on in computing  It was very geeky  Yes  Before people really knew  What that was all about 
[02:15:30]  I was compiling  Yes  You were compiling  He's still  God damn compiling  Yeah  Well fantastic man  It's so cool  To meet you  You're on the execs  The exes  Somebody keeps putting execs  On these things  The exes  The exes  They do put execs  I know  Did we sell it properly there Wayne  No  There's no way to tell you  How wonderful  Anything else you want to say  About the new show  It is  10.30  Wednesdays  Either watch it  Or just send money 
[02:16:00]  One or the other  It says 10 o'clock here  10 o'clock it says  It says 10 here  I don't think it is at 10  It's at 10.30  Oh man  On the east coast  10.30 on TV land  10.30 on TV land  Following Cedric  The entertainer's  Show Soul Man  They're making a real go  At new shows  Like they're doing  Original programming  Now on TV  And they're trying to do it  In a way where you can't tell  Is this a rerun  I don't know  You just sit there  And watch this  Just slide right into  The new material  Wow  Well you're in a good place  At least  Yeah  They're doing other shows  Does Betty White have a show  On TV land 
[02:16:30]  Yeah I'm pretty sure  Yes indeed she does  Hot in Cleveland  But she also has one  On NBC  And I believe she'll soon  Have one on every single  Yes  She is a force  To be reckoned with  Isn't she  Yeah I think we're all  Tired of her  Betty White  And you're great man  And good luck  With the show  It's called  The Execs  It's Wednesdays  I'm sorry  I didn't do that  On purpose  I literally  Yes  There's something about  You're not used to seeing  X's spelled out 
[02:17:00]  We use the X  Like for the X-Men  Because of Marvel  Because of the X-Men  Wow  I don't know why  It's weird to read  The X's  I guess usually  Because you see a big C  In the front of it  But the X's  Is on Wednesdays  On TV land  And it's either  10 or 10.30  10.30  10.30  10.30  For the love of God  Is incompetent  And wrong  So Wayne Knight  You're great man  Wayne thanks so much  For coming in  Thanks a lot  This is the  O.P. and Anthony Channel  To me it look like  A lemon cone to me

[02:20:30]  i was just watching one last night with newman they always go to him as like one of the um  like the expert of things when they need problems solved people go to newman in his little apartment  sitting in dimly lit uh apartment with a cigarette and just uh just giving people the information  travis you were just staring why didn't you ask a question uh you know what surprisingly anthony 
[02:21:00]  asked my question oh which one was it uh working with michael richards yes yeah yeah but you know  what like like it's tough with with guys like him there's all my questions have nothing to do with  him like i'm more interested in like the writing aspects and like the story development and some  unsolved questions that he would have no idea about and i just maybe he does though i didn't want to  maybe he had those discussions with the right people i would have asked if when they were uh  writing that you know whole jfk spoof if that was written because of his role in jfk or if they 
[02:21:30]  thought about it and they were like hey you know what wayne knight that see that would have been a  great question now i want to know where is he oh look it's little riley she's here  travis's little kid a little anymore um so yeah i would have liked to have known that because i  wondered that like did they go okay he was in the movie let's think of something to parody and he was 
[02:22:00]  that was a big plot it was actually his part too was in the courtroom standing there doing acting it  out like that uh yeah well now we'll never know now we just won't ever ever know he would have known  that although if i see him on the street he would have known that he's still in the building let's  ask him go ask him go ask him go ask him run down ask him if do you know what the question is call  in yes okay go ahead go run run use your phone let's get him on the air we have to know this now

[02:25:00]  question travis i want to make sure that sam question was yes to wayne knight in the from  the infamous keith hernandez two-part episode where uh they parodied jfk and the second spitter  was that written with him in mind because it was his role in jfk or did they say uh hey  wayne knight was in jfk he would fit great in this role right here we go  check check check 
[02:25:30]  okay um sam with opie and anthony they had actually one more question yeah they were just talking in  the studio about seinfeld stuff that they didn't ask you yeah they want to know if the jfk story  episode was that written because of your role in the movie or was it a coincidence actually uh uh  tom leopold who who broke that story was a big conspiracy jfk conspiracy fan he didn't even know 
[02:26:00]  i was in uh the movie and then he saw me in the movie and thought that it would be so cool to do  the reenactment of the you know uh zapruder film that we did in the film in the show so it was a  doppelganger of a doppelganger so he wrote the story not knowing but when he found out he added in the  the zapruder spoof the second the second spitter okay well thank you very much sure  i i'm not sure what was the answer yeah i'm confused he said the guy that wrote it was a 
[02:26:30]  conspiracy guy but he didn't say he started writing it before he realized that him in mind he said he  wrote the like the the the episode was written before he didn't even know that newman was in the  movie oh and then they added in that zapruder spoof oh so they added this found out so episode  doesn't matter but the scene they did because yes that uh wayne was in thus then okay thus then 
[02:27:00]  thus then and was that the correct question yes it was seven points why seven it's a big deal  shouldn't be six it's a big deal why didn't you continue interviewing him you had him you had an  exclusive there well i mean we he didn't know any more questions we didn't have anything else to ask  him i guess i might have asked i'd like the junior men's episode but i really like that one let's  not forget the x's uh way night's new project wednesday 10 p.m on tv live 10 10 30 our our sheet's  wrong sorry i never watched a lot of seinfeld do you guys ever see the masturbation episode 
[02:27:30]  yes chip yeah it's like i think everybody knows about that one yeah yeah where's the breaking bad  guys yeah one is here the other is on his way which one all right do you want to know who's who  who is early who's early brian cranston brian responsible brian cranston let's come early bitch  hey we got christmas like guy on what remember him jimmy from staten island jimmy what's going on  we're using you as filler what's going on with you 
[02:28:00]  two fucking days later i called yesterday i got jerked off  all right this is what i did first of all i didn't go show fucking lights to the rose parking lot  okay okay i would go to a person's home and decorate their house for christmas right okay  so sometimes these people would nickel and dime you and when you were done doing the job after  they had it on and on and on and on so what i would do is have a case of empty lights like packages 
[02:28:30]  in a box and i would put them out so that way when they broke my balls i'd like take something off  but sometimes they'll just a jerk off i'll just bang them out because i froze my ass off  i still have no idea how this scam works i don't know what you're talking about for lights but  they're empty boxes he'd bang them out you're banging them out for an empty box of lights i got 
[02:29:00]  that because they're jerk offs no i just explained it how do they not know the jerk off you're you're  charging them for extra lights but there is no extra lights because the light boxes are empty  and who's gonna count the plugs and who's gonna count the plugs and wait wait so you base you what  you charge them on on the amount of empty boxes left after you hang the lights no you dumbass 
[02:29:30]  i don't get it you know i don't get this if the guy's how do they not know you're handing them  an empty box of lights if the guy's a jerk off let's say he used that 18 boxes of lights actually  yeah he would charge it for 20 but why does he need the empty boxes yeah why do you need the empty  boxes that is a good question people say well how many lights are you just out the box so i just told  you you base it on the empty boxes that are left when you're done no are there empty boxes laying 
[02:30:00]  around yeah see you're the jackass so he's tossing a couple empty boxes on the pile of empty boxes  banging them out for a couple extra boxes because he's a jerk off now i get it but but the only  reason i didn't get it is because i asked him that and he said no and who counts the plugs we all know  that no one counts no one counts the plugs that's obvious that's how you bang them out that's right  because he's a jerk off you see there's only 18 not 20 right is that are we right now jimmy  there you go answer you get your house done for christmas you want to use this guy i ain't gonna let you 
[02:30:30]  bang me out motherfucker i have a company they come with the fucking cherry picker they put giant bows  on my columns yeah like a real guinea and you don't consider anthony a jerk off right  no he's just a quasi-asshole oh see that i mean if you're a quasi-asshole technical jargon he's gonna  he's gonna bang you out for at least uh one empty he's gonna bang me out i'll count the fucking  plugs it will count the fucking plugs that's right i'm sorry you count your fucking plugs dad  count your plugs so that's what you do for living is uh christmas lights oh no that was when i was a 
[02:31:00]  kid i put myself through college they bring the houses vacuum pools college what do you do now  christmas light jimmy burger you right through now i'm at a car dealership of course of course you  do how do you get in a motherfucking car how do you bang out the jerk offs at the dealership  uh you probably got big credit you can bank the payment  he answered hey what's up with that sticker price that's all bullshit right help us out here  a sticker sticker price first of all you got sticker and you got an invoice okay i want to

[02:35:30]  p.m on amc and we love it very excited and we love dish network we love them all now last time  we don't love dish they cut us out that's right see i'm with brian cresson  someone has to take his side uh you know without getting too far into it and i really don't know  there is a huge settlement that was that came down a little while ago against dish and for our 
[02:36:00]  parent company uh at amc and uh and so it's it feels a little punitive that they're uh trying to  punish uh amc networks they're just cutting them all off cutting them all yeah oh wow so walking  dead mad men all that is all yeah no one is that bad for for dish no one no one wants to see those  shows oh that's not true they don't really want to see their sponsor it's gotta play the side of  the sponsor yeah what are you gonna do i just do the library we're desperate sir are you uh not really  now last time you were in uh you were talking uh about walt and how um uh you were getting 
[02:36:30]  really really over the deep end uh and and very very bad and i'm seeing this happen yeah uh with the  first two episodes i saw no spoilers don't worry people you don't have to change uh uh the channel  here i'm not going to say anything but you're you are taking this to a very extreme level and it  doesn't look like it's going to end well i'll just say that well it is called breaking bad yeah yeah not 
[02:37:00]  breaking good no not breaking good i mean it is it is um going dark you know from the beginning we knew  that it was going to go this way because he our creator uh vince gilligan and the lord jesus christ  uh said uh that he wanted to take a guy who was um a really a nice guy a good guy and take him from  mr chips to scarface so we knew the trajectory i just didn't know how deep and dark it would actually 
[02:37:30]  go for this guy yeah just a complete disregard for anyone else but you and apparently your immediate  family but even even your wife on the show is starting to look at you like this is a monster  yeah and and i and she doesn't even know the half of it i know she doesn't it's uh it gets really bad  she doesn't need to know uh who's gonna tell her you're gonna tell her i'm not saying a word  you go about your business mr science teacher the thing that's so interesting about this is that 
[02:38:00]  i think certainly men but any human being is capable of getting this dark given the right set  of circumstance i'm telling you i i think it's possible what's happened to walter white is that  he's been seduced never before in his adult life has he had money has he been able to intimidate any  other man ever just mild-mannered science teacher he was invisible to everybody even himself and all of a 
[02:38:30]  sudden through these set of circumstances he finds himself he finds his power and yeah he's preening  now he's a he's a peacock uh but he but it's it's better than feeling numb you know so if you if you  told him uh you you can have an extraordinary two years to live or the absolute most boring 20 years to  live what would you do and he's like i'm not so sure there's a lot of desperation and depression  involved in you know that kind of that kind of desperate life yeah the uh the transformation has 
[02:39:00]  been done so well that it's believable uh that's that's the amazing part over the course of all the  seasons you have gone from just the invisible science teacher to a drug kingpin for the most part  and uh the whole transformation has been very realistic because it's it it didn't there wasn't any one  moment that kind of made it happen it's just all these things came together uh over time i think i 
[02:39:30]  think that's what breaking bad does well is that he uses the medium the way it should it's like your  show use the medium the way look at us see you do you use the medium the way it should it's immediate  it's it's current it's funny it moves quickly yeah um breaking bad would not make a good movie  because there are too many elements that would have been necessary to cut out in order to make  it an hour and a half to two hours and you'd look at it and say how did this guy become this he was just 
[02:40:00]  it's too truncated there's too many leaps so serialized television slowly played out agonizingly  played out sometimes you wanted the best way you definitely saw the direction you wanted to go in  but it took these things these hurdles you had to go over and awful things you had to do to learn  how to be that evil it's an amazing transformation yeah it's very cool a really a sociological experiment 
[02:40:30]  to me can i i don't want to give any spoilers or anything i gotta ask you uh at the beginning  very beginning of the first episode of season five we do see a different look on you um a different  look when you're near the trunk yes you do uh was that a flash you're being so good but i was i'm  trying was that a flash forward it is a flash forward okay you're looking at a flash forward  so we'll get a little resolution of that well no you know what's funny is that the teaser the teaser  of the first episode this sunday uh on amc at 10 o'clock uh east coast and west coast nine o'clock 
[02:41:00]  in the middle um is is revealing in so many ways yes and yet not and you don't get anything you know  it's like what what what and then you realize i don't what did i just see that's what i was doing  i was literally craning my neck looking up going what's in there what is like thinking i'd see  something different if i looked the other way yeah uh just it's it's been such a compelling show 
[02:41:30]  the uh suspense is great uh the second episode of this season was edge of your seat the entire time  is edge of your seat mike the character mike in there uh the fact what he wants to do and what he  has to do the difference in that is you you start feeling bad for him yeah and he's a son of a bitch  it's amazing how this show toys with your sympathies yes where you have these people doing 
[02:42:00]  awful things and yet you're sympathizing and almost rooting for them come on make that crystal math  bring back the old team let's get the band back together kind of a feel to it  it really is housewives saying oh maybe we just warn him with a you know shooting his kneecap  as opposed to killing him i think that you know i don't think we have to kill everyone  that that just goes to show how how well the writing is because you really brilliant how do you get 
[02:42:30]  somebody that's so awful of a person and and make him sympathetic what was so interesting about  vince gilligan's jump into this is that historically television has always been about staying the same  every single character that you know and love in the past you could turn on the television there he is  there's my guy my pal he's always the same i can depend on it and this show has has always been  about change how can we change and just when he comes to a certain point change him again yeah get 
[02:43:00]  him darker get him moving and then what about uh my wife who is oh she's a loving caring how oh wait a  minute maybe she's changing too she's got a little in her yeah everybody's changing yeah she's got a  little bit of uh evil in her too but i i think it's almost like she didn't realize how bad this was  going to get and how far you drag your family into into all this and what is the i initially i guess 
[02:43:30]  the motivation was dying of cancer uh have to take care of the family so it was a noble effort right  when you started but how did it get so evil what what is it in the character is it the fact that you  did the character just didn't want to be bored for the the rest of his life well if you you know it's  been a hypothetical we've all played if you had a year to live how would you live your life and  this poor bastard's thinking uh i'm just gonna wither away and my wife's gonna empty my bedpan and 
[02:44:00]  and we'll blow through whatever little savings we have and that's the legacy i'm leaving no man wants  to you you want to have some control so for the first time in his life he makes a bold move and says  by god i'm gonna do this thing because i know how the one thing i don't know is is what to do with it  i don't know how to sell it so that's why he needs aaron paul's character jesse in order to come  in to distribute the thing simple plan make a bunch of money give it to my family die there it is 
[02:44:30]  it doesn't but he realizes once you sell your morality for for cash you're you're lost there's  no line try to become someone you're not you're lost so you paint like a real picture of this guy  like as an actor do you how much of that do you do beforehand well how much of it do you do just  from the script or do you actually will you go home and think like who is this person or what  how do you see it when you play somebody not anymore when you first start to to put a character  together you you ask that question a lot where is he from in fact most actors including myself will 
[02:45:00]  will do what's called a backstory you'll write your own backstory his education where he was raised  teachers things like that that just helps fill in the blanks for you and some of it may come to  fruition some of it may never be known except to you but you start doing that so you have more anchor  points the more that an actor knows about a character it gets inside of him or her and you feel more 
[02:45:30]  comfortable in in how you portray it after a certain point i don't have to think about it i just live it  i slip into his wallabies put on the glasses and the chinos and and i go there you are how much  how much different of a guy is he from you i mean not the behavior but i mean as a guy he's killed  more people than i have no but i mean like i've killed people don't i don't want to paint the wrong  picture i don't mean his actions i mean like as a as a person like you know because this is a regular  person pushed into extraordinary circumstances so that's kind of what you're based on is being a real 
[02:46:00]  person he's not anything like me no no no and he's he's very very smart so there there's the big  comparison there he's he's been put in a position where he has not expressed himself as a as a man as  a as an adult he's never taken chances my whole career is it being an actor and being in the arts  you're you're taking chances constantly and you have to get comfortable with that he's you know he's 
[02:46:30]  introverted or at the start he was he was shy he was milquetoast and so i had to get into that mindset  of what what makes him be him what makes a person what makes a man cave in like that and become  depressed and i came up that he was he developed a fear of failure and that he had missed opportunities  in his life and that led to his depression and that led to this kind of invisible man you know concept  that i wanted to bring forward and so when we were designing the face and the hair i took all the 
[02:47:00]  color out of my hair when i when we first started i had this little impotent mustache yeah a mustache  that you can see through and was light because we lightened it and and thinned it out and you'd never  if you want to look make an impotent mustache you guys i know you'd want this you never have the  have the hair turn down the corners of the mouth because then it gets macho when you get down 
[02:47:30]  there so so i used to cut it here i thin it out i wanted a mustache for people look at and go  what's what's the point  what are you trying to say wow yeah we look at really so you groomed that it's like what do you  an impotent mustache so i wanted him to disappear so all his clothes were taupes and sand color and  and off whites and thing i wanted him to blend into the walls i wanted him to feel invisible 
[02:48:00]  and so on those first episodes when i'm in the classroom and trying to look at at anybody who  might be interested in chemistry and getting nothing it helped it helped me as a character  realize i i'm i'm so depressed how did i get here i'm looking at it nobody cares that i'm even here  yeah nobody knows i'm even here if i walked out of this classroom they wouldn't even know they're  going to continue texting and whatever is i've lost and that was part lost that was like part of 
[02:48:30]  what what made you do what you you ended up doing on the show yeah i guess if you were a successful  or if the character was a successful teacher that was beloved by the students even if you got the  cancer and needed to get money for the family it probably wouldn't have worked out the same way it  was just a combination of everything it had all everything to do all the features all those  elements yeah but one thing confusing though you did it initially for your family and out of love 
[02:49:00]  for your family and concern about their future and then it seems like you lost the concern for your  family because you pretty much put them in danger uh now with what you're doing what are you saying  how did that you got a problem not at all i think it's great all for one all for me wait but but  what what what happened with the character that he kind of almost not wrote off his family but  doesn't didn't seem that concerned walter white was seduced he was seduced by power by money all the 
[02:49:30]  things even at the cost of his family well he didn't realize i mean he you you we've all met very  bright people who in social situations i mean you go oh my god this guy's a phd and he's like  unbelievably bright and yet he can't hold a conversation in a social environment or whatever  so it doesn't mean if you're good at one thing you're you're good at another and so here you have 
[02:50:00]  a man who is is very smart but he made some poor choices and he actually thinks that uh this simple  plan will work but he doesn't have the skill set to be a a mastermind criminal at least back then he  did and he's learning quickly yeah yeah is there anything hard for you as an actor is there anything  that's hard for you to play like when they ask you to do once like is there a behavior or an emotion  that's easier for you or more comfortable for you and then there's one that when you do it you're like  all right this one's more work um any you know any given emotion i don't know um yeah if you're if 
[02:50:30]  you're asked to to play some um fast talking kind of uh guy who is authority on something you have a lot  of research to do because uh you have to really delve into that and know what you're talking about  because it's coming out of your mouth so much faster than you ever thought um my guy on drive  that movie drive was kind of that way where he he talked too much he spoke too much so i had to just 
[02:51:00]  get back into the garage and and you know just get my head into that you know that grease monkey  kind of mentality and and pick up a wrench and figure out things and you know because i i and  and you know i ad-libbed a lot in that film and it was a lot about cars and things like that yeah  do you give yourself something to do like a lot of a lot of great actors will do that like they'll  always be doing something like normal like whether it's uh you know eating or just doing something  like get a pacino with his hands that people like there's these little weird things that actors do 
[02:51:30]  that i think is so interesting just to feel like it's real life it gives it gives actors a handle  something to hold on to if you're just standing there it it doesn't always feel the most comfortable  so if you're actually doing something and you know peeling a potato or something anything it  basically makes the actor a little distracted in an activity which uh which is a good thing see i  never know it's a running joke on this show but i don't know when i'm just standing there like if 
[02:52:00]  if they said in every scene like that i've ever like we need to just dump salt on something like  if there was slugs in every scene i'd be fucking amazing but when you just have to stand there  like walk into a room and make a proclamation i just i stiff it up and i literally don't know  i watch hands so much when people act because it's so hard to be natural and conversational like  right now my hands are just dead you don't think about it when you're talking to someone on the street  your hands are doing what they do but if you were uh told to speak to a person on camera now 
[02:52:30]  you're conscious of everything like we were holding this conversation if i had written this  conversation out and we were having it you'd be sitting there as natural as you are and my hands  i'd be like i'd be raising them i'd be fucking poking things and then they'll tell you no you're  you're moving your hands let's do another take everybody and just keep your hands to your side  now you're totally now you're thinking get my hands on my side i've been moving my hands exactly  now they're like frozen down jim jim this is whose life is it anyway you can't be moving your hands  around a lot remember jim you're paralyzed from the neck down so the movement thing is a little bit 
[02:53:00]  of a problem i'm always interested in in how guys do that maybe they just don't maybe you're just so  good you don't think about it anymore but that's i'm fascinated by how you can make that so  fucking natural it's so hard to do man it does look good well it's supposed to look hard but  and it'd look easy but it's it is actually very difficult to do are you comfortable around uh guns  uh you you do a lot of gunplay in uh in the uh well my character is not yes he's he doesn't 
[02:53:30]  know from that world so no he's he's not too comfortable when i was a kid i used to shoot rifles  yeah and doing some competitive shooting and uh that was fun i enjoyed that yeah yeah so i i know  my way around it oh okay yeah yeah i guess you're uh more apt to poison somebody or something like a  little more yeah sorry yeah wait a minute did he touch my coffee yeah that was i love the idea of  incorporating science in uh in in killing people yeah there's more of that coming up this year i don't 
[02:54:00]  doubt it it does work well and um your loyalty to uh jesse um it seems like it's there in the  criminal element of what you want to do but as a person or friend you have really no respect or or  like for this guy well you know i don't know and i think he idolizes you he still calls you mr white  well which is very odd to watch a sign of respect you've done it's i think it's more a sign of 
[02:54:30]  him kind of still being a child uh in in the classroom yeah and calling you mr white uh but  yeah you you personally on a personal level you've done horrible things to this guy well i don't know  i mean if everybody finds out what i've done yes there will be hell to pay yeah yeah but he's a  great great actor and yeah he's fun to work he's supposed to be here yeah i was gonna say great  actor not very he's not very punctual he he doesn't own a watch he doesn't he has no clue what 
[02:55:00]  time it is at any given yeah they said he was stuck in traffic yeah but uh yeah it just does seem like  you've you put everything aside even that and and that's a very threatening place to put yourself  because you know he would do awful things if he found out what you've done yeah and you know as we  wind down for season this season five starts on sunday for eight episodes season six will start  next summer for eight episodes and then we're done see i did not know that yes yeah and that's 
[02:55:30]  gonna be okay and that'll be it wow i need more are you okay with that i'm okay with that yeah i mean  it will have i think it's time yeah i mean given our the conceit of the story that this man had  two years to live and he's still gonna die of lung cancer if if not of something else uh beforehand but  yeah i i want to stay true to what we told the audience and be and be fair with that and uh  you don't want to do like mash for the korean war's 11 years 11 years  i thought this was supposed to only be three years the beatles are playing 
[02:56:00]  was it 11 years yeah i guess it was yeah it's time it's time to move on it's time to move on close  it down and we got the total recall movie when is that coming out that comes out august 3rd  it's coming out soon yeah yeah i can't wait very cool i can't wait for that very cool gonna be  huge absolutely it is do you remember here's an odd question do you remember the last time that you  were lousy like like something you did like years ago that you're like oh god was i awful i wasn't too 
[02:56:30]  kind to my wife the other day  um oh yeah oh sure in fact in fact uh friends of mine uh have a humiliation night where they ask  you to bring the ass actors and performers to bring your worst shit over wow you know how easy  it is to be me and bring everything no and see that's it you have to call through that and say  this is the worst i've ever been what a great idea it is and you drink you're drinking all night 
[02:57:00]  long and you're you're laughing at everyone else's horrible performances it's great you're just  ripping each other completely we've had uh some of the stand-ups uh come in and and we played some  of their early material and some of their uh videos and we've actually yeah we we played shit  that we've done on the air it's humiliating we were first on the radio just happy to be there  five minutes after the big hour five o'clock here just embarrassing but that's gotta be 
[02:57:30]  pretty nerve-wracking just sitting there with your friends goofing on your uh yeah your work the last  time we did it was with uh seth mcfarland he was over and we were drinking and he he did an on-camera  thing on star trek the the tv series and he was this he was really stiff and in the background  you know he's doing a marching it looked like he had something stuck up his ass it was funny so  funny it is embarrassing to watch so even though you're getting laughs from your friends it really 
[02:58:00]  is on some level like oh god is that rough what did you bring i brought this uh i brought this thing  called crisis counselor which was a a really bad uh one of the early reality shows back in like 1980  i want to say and uh it was kind of an improv uh show dealing with um with uh therapy sessions  group therapy sessions and they would only tell you basically what you are and then everything else just 
[02:58:30]  just comes out and uh i i played this guy who uh had uh who was married and his wife is pregnant  and he has a male lover on the side and and i was told you need to make this right on the show  you just need to say what's wrong with this and i went really and so my arguments were like i don't  know i just you know she was a little sick so i thought i'd uh step away have myself a lover 
[02:59:00]  were you playing it up like that not unlike any other guy would do  go get yourself a love a male lover uh you know when your wife is pregnant right  and it's like they're looking at me like what you're such an ass and so everybody else on the  panel was was you know throwing daggers at me and i'm trying to this weak argument anyway  we had a blast they were oh crisis carved me up quite a bit you know how uh i i guess back then 
[02:59:30]  you'd never thought this would end up for public consumption but all this stuff can be found on  youtube and everything's available and back then it was like all right that's gone forever  there's no way it's never gonna see the light of day never surface and here you go there it is  yeah that's yep they're telling us you have to leave they're telling us uh oh that you have to  so uh brian cranston aaron paul is in traffic but uh breaking bad season five it's sunday 10 o'clock  on amc and where can people get it if they don't have if they're on dish or something they don't 
[03:00:00]  have it is there another way to see it itunes netflix yeah right i think you know those are the  we we do on demand on demand it's it's great all right so there's a way to see it absolutely great  show yeah tremendous actor i love it uh it if if you have not seen it you have like uh maybe what  the weekend to do a big long uh marathon four seasons catch up i would do it i'd run two tvs at  once and do two episodes at the same time it's uh it's fantastic i love it and like i said when 
[03:00:30]  you were here last time the uh the first episode of the first season grabs you yeah the only  comparison i have really is is the lost pilot was like that when yes all of a sudden there's a plane  crash people walk around they're like what is going on here yeah and you have to stick around  for it and that's exactly what breaking bad is fantastic show huge fan brian appreciate it thanks  you guys all right appreciate it sirius xm xm this is the op and anthony show with that we got to

[03:01:30]  character because these guys have been i guess for this their fifth season what's the longest you've  you've you've stuck with one character i mean i i guess up to now probably frodo lord of the rings  that was the longest you know three films how many years four years okay damn four years yeah wow  and wilfrid is uh am i saying all right wilfrid i kept saying willard it's so hard to not say willard  i know because that's such a a lot of people people do it to me all the time yeah hey that show  willie i've heard i've heard wilbur i love your show wilbur season two i try not to correct people

[03:02:30]  blowjob but who got it it was the superintendent uh uh at the office that i work in um he was  giving a blowjob to my boss oh guy was blown uh oh it was shining how great is that yeah  shelly deval runs it was a superintendent with with a questionable mental capacity as well which  made it even more disturbing all right that's great you know what though fx is the place to be  yes i mean in truth though we have we have an incredible amount of freedom to make the show 
[03:03:00]  that we want to make which is great i mean the same goes for for louis as well yeah that guy  he writes his shows he doesn't have to clear any of that with the network and he makes it all in a  bubble and just send it he tells a story how like they ask and he's like don't worry about it i'll  deliver the series on time it's great but i know i recently did a voiceover for as a radio character  for a louis episode but enough about me did you really yeah yeah we all did it was really  so easy i know we just sat here and did this the on-camera stuff that's hard which uh oh i've 
[03:03:30]  done a couple well you know how it is a couple actors just talking shopper yeah i love louis  but again he's a guy louis louis a guy but it shows you what happens when you let a creatively  brilliant dude just do what he does just do his thing he writes because he's a fucking he's a like  i was on looking at like prostitute ads recently of course yeah of course i was but i'm thinking this  is why louis greatness is what it is and this is why i am fucking mediocrity i'm looking at eros.com  he's editing something his obsession is his fucking show sure and he writes it he edits he probably 
[03:04:00]  looks at eros.com as well i would hope so he looks at you with envy goes hey no he doesn't look at me  but i mean that's that's the drive you're gonna have to pull it off and that's what happens you  get a fucking it's it's brilliant yeah it's brilliant yeah uh you when when you i i follow you on  twitter and you uh a lot of musical tweets it's true you're like hey i'm listening to this yeah  and uh it's it's usually a pretty eclectic mix yeah yeah i have a pretty varied taste in music 
[03:04:30]  and i it's funny i i was really reluctant to join twitter um yeah you know i have a facebook a private  facebook account and the idea of twitter i just i don't need another thing and i don't need people  to know what the fuck i'm doing right we have too many things you know what i mean and i and  part of twitter is this notion that you know a lot of people just tweet about the stuff that they  do in their day and and i'm a relatively private person so i was like i was just so resistant but i  joined and i kind of love it i mean i i basically use it to write music recommendations and i retweet 
[03:05:00]  a lot of people that i follow i don't write a lot of stuff about my daily life and i kind of realized  you can just sort of use it for however you want to use it yeah yeah you just pop on whatever you  want you you actually uh put something on there that had me in hysterics it was uh a while ago too  that that uh french girl that's talking telling that story about the animals oh yeah and stuff i  was like that's hilarious amazing yeah just amazing but it was one of your uh one of your tweets you'll  just link cool stuff yeah that's primarily how i use it and it's it's been interesting too because 
[03:05:30]  twitter is this giant universe wherein you can actually connect with people that you are a fan of  and they will connect with you weird right it is it's fascinating i mean i've met people and made  connections with people that that i love that i don't know that i would have found an organic way  to have done that in life and i think that's kind of amazing yeah i think it goes uh for yes celebrity  or even relationship wise things like that no matter how long or short you want them to last right 
[03:06:00]  uh it's opened up a whole thing uh that it's very odd these days we were talking about how how  difficult it was to even get in touch with a celebrity years ago you had to write a letter  right it had to hopefully get past the publicist and this and maybe get to the you know clark gable  or something now it's just people are there to not only just say i love what you do but to go  you suck which is yeah i don't know how good that is but uh it's just an odd thing that you have this 
[03:06:30]  availability of these celebrities and you could be so nasty yeah to uh to people it is it's kind of  interesting i mean there are certainly people that engage that i i don't you know i certainly  get my fair share of you know you suck i can't help but it doesn't it doesn't bother me it's just a  to me it's just a sort of it's a feed of comments and some of some comments ultimately rise to the top  and are of some interest and the rest of it's just how do what is it like it can be sort of white  noise wow elijah gee that epic three film masterpiece you were in you suck how do you how do you 
[03:07:00]  are you kidding yeah that's kind of silly yeah we get it when we get the you suck yeah of course  you know it's monday the lord of the rings guy is getting a you suck that's stupid yeah it is but  you don't you don't entertain it it really is amazing it's sort of pointless to entertain it  because it's you know you entertain it with one person and then it's another person what's the  point it's you block them right no i just don't give a shit how i don't care it doesn't i read 
[03:07:30]  it doesn't bother me and i've gotten you know some that have written multiple times but if you  ignore it it ultimately goes away you i think the problem with engaging is if you engage it it just  makes it worse it exacerbates the problem sometimes it gives them energy to just you know keep spewing  their shit blocking them is great i do it's a good feeling it's great you're not allowed to go to  someone's house with a bat and hit their wrists but you can feel like i may have blocked a person 
[03:08:00]  once yeah yeah sometimes they need because you're not infringing on their right to do anything you're  just infringing on their right to get into your living room which is a fair thing to not want that's  true yeah i don't want to control people say it but i want to control what what i what i have to  fucking listen to you know that's my changing the channel yeah yeah but the worst though is a girl  who's like twittering and she's kind of hot and then you send a dm of course and then you email a little  bit and of course the real phone number never comes and you realize i figured it was a guy  oh no yeah oh jimmy now that'll happen i've run into that walkway it's so interesting how how social 
[03:08:30]  networking has changed the way we date too you know yes yeah like we now you know somebody can  recommend somebody to us and then we'll go we can go on their facebook page and see photos and  pre-screen and yeah you get like a dossier we can have like direct messages and just sort of dip our  toe into the situation before actually it's so you could be brave enough to say certain things you  would never say face to face that's true and then when you finally are face to face you've gone 
[03:09:00]  through so much preliminary stuff that you can almost throw yourselves right into the sack it's  it's quite astounding at times it is it is  all the things that you would normally have to do on multiple dates to get to know one another is now  happening it's a lot quicker and again do it with five different people at once like literally i mean  instant messages you can be talking to a couple of different sure on the prospects some hooks in  the water but like a long line fisherman but in some ways i don't know how good it is i mean  they're definitely positives to it but it's also making it so that it's harder for people to just 
[03:09:30]  communicate with people yeah i don't think you can call people on the phone or to right to meet in  person to have genuine communication and conversation is harder because people aren't having to be as  used to that process i don't think you have to be as as get into as deep a conversation you don't  have to be as crafty or clever sometimes it's more of a quantity than quality kind of thing uh just  yeah i don't know if that's good or not what's worse though than when you make plans with some 
[03:10:00]  lump and she uh cancels lump some she cancels day of or you go out to dinner and it's a bust and she  lives in like you know an hour from the city and she's like can you come and get me and you're like  we're going to dinner in the city you fucking zilch that's why he's a romantic but i mean he's  but you can come through so much of this nonsense through text and you get to it does jade you in  a certain way because you're right it really does hurt conversational stuff but you weed through a lot 
[03:10:30]  of bullshit that would be awful sometimes you get rid of it first sometimes though i think it's  sometimes that bullshit is healthy that first yeah that first contact initial talking it's i  think that's missed sometimes i don't know i kind of like it i kind of like that i think it's just  important for communication skills you know yeah i think there's a whole new generation that's growing  up without it without having to rely on those things and i think it's going to be to our detriment  to a certain degree how about reading people's faces when you're looking at them face to face and 
[03:11:00]  having a conversation you know you could tell by their faces how they feel about something that  you're not going to get in a text or a message totally it's just in that line of sure they will  you get the two dots and a little frowny face it's also kind of a smiley face every once in a while  it's like an emoticon what's wrong with that just bring an emoticon card  are you careful what you say because you're afraid that you're well known and like you know it's 
[03:11:30]  different for an actor i mean i'm careful on twitter yeah no no but i mean like even in private  conversation when you're texting it's there forever and it can be saved and captured sure  i i tend to only yeah i mean if i'm texting somebody uh generally i'm i'm use discretion with  who i'm texting and what i'm texting to different there's a trust level with certain people that  you don't have with other people and totally thank god there's nobody cares about anything i do  because there's if it ever became like scandalous for a comedian to have dick pictures out there  oh am i in dutch that has got to be the worst idea the notion of a dick picture i just think is so 
[03:12:00]  i mean i love a breast uh picture yeah good artistic oh it's fantastic sure get receiving those for  women women are fantastic the notion of then reciprocating with your dick not a good idea not an  attractive piece of anatomy to send to somebody especially not the way i take them which is on  a webcam with no face and you can see the bottom of my fat stomach oh my sweat that's awesome 
[03:12:30]  that's an assault no but i mean it's i never face i never who tarot you can't throw your face in  there never dude because first of all it ruins the picture no it's it's plausibility like denial  you can you can deny that shit but it's it's sometimes with jimmy the dick and the face is in  the same shot  there's longer the skirts in there nobody thinks anything you know especially young lady 
[03:13:00]  but uh no it's very like carol always get in trouble well not in trouble but i mean you got you  know somebody released uh or clay uh who's the singer uh from american he can play he had the shirtless  with his face so you gotta watch what you put there might have been a politician you gotta put out  oh right what picture of clay he was like in a gay chat room or something but he was shirtless  and i guess they captured him it's like you know you gotta be careful with that you gotta watch what  you say private yeah if you're a private person want to keep your life private it's very hard to 
[03:13:30]  text things and trust that it's going to be kept private totally yeah yeah and women lie about  their status and then the guy it's like i'm i'm always amazed with these dummies that don't erase  things i know what are you doing you gotta be you have to know what you're dealing with it's the  internet man and like nothing is totally safe yeah yeah nothing secure no your phone nothing  even emails that you send people yeah you know you have to be aware of the fact that it's not totally  secure you know we will have been the pioneers the people that have taken the beatings for making 
[03:14:00]  these mistakes we're gonna make all the mistakes for future generations future generations that  learn from they'll know you don't do certain things but the first guy that sent a dick pic  didn't think like oh she's just gonna look at it and you know delete it or save it she's not going  to send it she sent it out to everybody oh shit exactly yeah we we kind of are we're the pioneers  to show you how bad it is a guy one of the guys from anonymous and those guys are computer geniuses 
[03:14:30]  they're hackers oh yeah those guys are smart they're an yeah they're pretty yeah bright dudes  and one of them got busted because he sent out a picture of tit but there was a traceable thing  through the uh the photo how did one of those dudes let that happen i guess he didn't realize that his  that picture could be traced to his girlfriend's iphone or his iphone or whatever it was it all  has it all has metadata all of it yeah yeah so they got btk the uh the serial killer in kansas uh  the really the yep he puts that on a floppy disk like an a a drive yeah but uh his the information 
[03:15:00]  from the church that he sent it i'm babbling no we've learned a lot this morning i know we haven't  even talked about wilfred's we want to make sure people see wilfred thursdays at 10 p.m yes on fx  yes what kind of situations are going to be uh exposed this season um there's blowjobs under the table  i think that's our sole blowjob under the table uh there's there's a there's not a whole lot i can 
[03:15:30]  talk about there's some surprises there's a there's an episode that involves um doggy dancing  that i'm looking forward to i think we might be showing that episode at comic-con uh as a preview  which will be exciting um you know the ryan my character is in a state of recovery we find him in  this season doing a lot better than he had been last season he's out he's has a job now he's got  out of the house he's not sitting in the basement smoking bongs um so he's he's getting better and 
[03:16:00]  sort of interacting with other people and he ultimately starts a relationship which proves to  be relatively healthy initially but um you know that's boring so it's gonna have to things kind of  fall apart it's gonna have to twist a little around a little bit right yeah nice and what's  going on with uh the hobbit yeah the hobbit um well the hobbit comes out in december it'll be the  first of two films um i have a tiny part because frodo's actually not alive during the time of the 
[03:16:30]  hobbit right right myself and um ian holm who played bilbo in in the lord of the rings we reprise  our roles he is older bilbo and me as frodo um and it'll play i believe in the big it's sort of the  beginning of and then they go back and and then it's essentially him telling his story oh okay  cool yeah when you have but i'm looking forward to it and peter jackson obviously is it is the  director and the whole thing yeah and ian mckellen came back to play gandalf and um cape blanchett is  back wow man yeah and it was a trip going back to new zealand after so long it it must have been 
[03:17:00]  it was it does peter have some new um toys at his disposal given that a few years have gone by and  technology always advances in especially in film yeah he's shooting the entire thing digitally um  i believe they have 35 red cameras and it's all uh in 3d on set jesus so they have you know in his  in his monitor tent they have a giant um flat screen that that projects uh 3d and he sits there and you 
[03:17:30]  can actually watch each take in 3d happening in 3d unbelievable so the techno it was actually kind  of amazing going back because so much hasn't changed it's largely the same crew it's all the  same place but they have larger studios now and more technology um you know they've got a whole  3d kind of unit on set there are more trailers uh this time around he pushed he pushed the technology  to the brink uh during the trilogy and it looked it it was just amazing yeah they're beautiful 
[03:18:00]  them they held up too oh my god yeah yeah the scale the the the vastness of some of the scenes  that the the um amount of characters that they would put in those those uh big battle scenes and  everything just amazing and i i can't wait to see uh i can't wait either i mean i i worked on it for  such a short amount of time so i get to i get to actually have an objective perspective and go and  see it as a fan right yeah yeah without having to work for months and years uh years actually on on  the project like exactly yeah what do you do when you act if you walk like do you ever get nervous 
[03:18:30]  anymore like do you ever get afraid when you're doing it um sure what do you what do you do so  it's not paralyzing it's never it's never paralyzing um but you know like the first day back on wilford  i was nervous like you know like first day of school jitters i actually got kind of nervous back on  the hobbit it was weird like i was in the wardrobe and the feet and the wig and the ears and all that  again and it was such a comfortable environment in some ways but it kind of hit me like oh shit i'm 
[03:19:00]  i don't know the pressure of of just playing the character again um but it never feels debilitating  i you know i get nervous but i think it's just it's a healthy kind of energy that just sort of feeds  the work and i ultimately find my comfort zone after like a few takes and i'm sort of in it you know  are you better as you go on take wise i think so i think it depends you know i think sometimes  the the first instinct or the energy of a first take can often be the best but sometimes you know 
[03:19:30]  on wilford i find that we have so little time to shoot those episodes it's like three or four days  and we're shooting six to eight pages a day so we don't really have time for rehearsal so in some ways  we're finding it as we're going so i find that the fourth and fifth takes on on wilford are better  um because we don't have a lot of time to like sit around and figure out what we're going to do  we block it a couple of times and then we're shooting so we're sort of we're getting it like  the groove kind of happens fourth fifth take in oh okay yeah because i'm i'm always uh my minimal 
[03:20:00]  experience always better as we go on never good on the first one i just do and then i'm once i'm not  fired i'm like okay take two will be a little bit better than that sorry i was holding the paper up  i still i mean i never take anything for granted i still feel that way i still sometimes the first  day in a film i'll think fuck am i gonna you know hope i hope i'm doing all right i could be fired  on on the first week on the first season of wilford i thought i my days are numbered i i could be fired 
[03:20:30]  genuinely had these feelings which was in hindsight retarded were you looking at your performance and  going this isn't yeah maybe uh you know we'd done the pilot i felt really good about the pilot  and everybody was psyched about it um and you know maybe i wasn't getting enough positive sort  of reassurance that things were going well and so you know when you're not hearing it it's easy for  your mind to then spin out of control and think ridiculous things right um so i thought that i could 
[03:21:00]  be fired that is the worst i don't think i've ever told anybody that it's hilarious that's scary  you're not getting you're not getting feedback and you have no idea how it's going how is that  we got but i think it's ultimately i think it's really healthy to think that way because i think  the the opposite end of the spectrum is really unhealthy you know what i mean to assume that  everything's great and i think it makes you strive less to be better and to work harder for your place 
[03:21:30]  i think the more creative people are uh actors music musicians and whatnot they they look at  themselves a lot lower than what other people i think it's healthy to be you know sort of um  yeah a certain to have a certain amount of being unsettled are you saying that i'm wrong that after  every take i actually stand up and scream you're welcome at the crew  they're telling us elijah has to go his other press busy man busy man of course elijah would and 
[03:22:00]  uh the wilfred it print season two starts 10 o'clock thursdays on fx and it's at wood elijah and elijah  spelled e-l-i-j-a-h yes you don't know on twitter yeah follow you get some uh cool musical uh  little tidbits and other things oh cool really fun thanks for coming thanks for coming back  you're great thanks thank you are we done for the day yeah i think so see you tomorrow  you've heard about it you've waited four long hours for it finally the moment is at hand

[03:24:00]  have sal but we actually had some even even more even more feminine even more feminine energy going  on today breaking bad is a huge show i had no idea i don't watch the show but it should you'll like it  i think i will i'm just waiting to i think i'm waiting to you know commit myself to that is the  travis family all breaking bad fans yeah even the little even the little one no she doesn't know what  the hell she's not supposed yeah she doesn't know she goes away overhead right she doesn't know what  the fuck she's watching i'm trying to explain it to her i'm like this is math and she just yeah 
[03:24:30]  just watch yo gabba gabba um come on yeah well you know why there are so many ladies here today  why is that the one guest that didn't show up is that right yeah all the girls are here for aaron  paul yeah they all think he's oh they're not brian cranston they're not oh no don't get me wrong  everyone was very excited that brian cranston you know why i was excited that brian cranston was here  seinfeld no because he had his uh he had a shirt and tie on today and he was wearing a skinny tie  and he looked like he did in apollo 13 when he played buzz aldrin nobody and he did a terrible 
[03:25:00]  see if you can find brian cranston apollo 13 because he did this terrible uh astronaut joke oh he goes  he's on this tv show and they ask him some kind of question and brian cranston is buzz aldrin goes  well i guess you could say it's out of this world i've never seen the movie you never seen apollo 13  no i i gotta say though i like how how sal is is slowly trying to become your co-host he said 
[03:25:30]  and he still does the uh he still comes in here and he goes hey i think i think i'm gonna hang  on here today is that cool i go sal you can hang out wherever you want you know i'm not gonna tell  you where to hang out if you want to hang out in here hang out in here is he better co-host than eric  um i don't know good stories get over it no i wouldn't say yes because yeah eric co-host eric acts  as a good foil do you know what i mean in the shakespearean sense eric is uh he's a good counter 
[03:26:00]  point uh and a good point and laugh whereas that like and there's also yeah we've done a lot of  pointing and laughing at sal that's true but there's more often things going on with eric like  today that's true i don't think sal's ever stopped on the middle of the highway and took a shit right  sal have you ever done that no never done do you ever have a story do you have any stories comparable  to eric had to stop and take a shit in the middle of the lie uh no nowhere near i mean i i had my  birthday party a couple weeks ago and i had a piece so bad i had a piece so bad on the bus ride home 
[03:26:30]  no find out about this i'm finding out about it right now i had a i had a piece eric were you  invited to sal's birthday party no it was just me and my friends hanging out you guys aren't my  friends like that so oh i guess not i don't know uh see that line being drawn in the sand yeah  so anyway i had a piece so bad coming home on the bus i thought i didn't care about this story okay  never mind yeah i mean i'm all pissed off that i didn't get to go to the party yeah it wasn't a  party we went to the city and just you know drank that was all same thing nagel said it didn't make  it any easier williamsburg no i went to williamsburg yeah of course i went to williamsburg we don't go to 
[03:27:00]  manhattan we're hipsters yeah so anyway v-neck t-shirt i had a piece so fucking bad there was  people sitting all around us on the bus would you have a but you have a pbr can or something  no we were drinking pbr earlier in the night but i bet you were was this the rockabust  there's a bus that goes from williamsburg to rockaway now yeah really on the weekends yeah  just because there's not enough hipsters there that they need to bus them in from williamsburg and  is everybody wear tight flannel on it i don't know thankfully i don't live around there yeah 
[03:27:30]  so go on yeah so i had no i had a piece like literally i was my i was bent over in pain  and there was people all around us and i found a water bottle that was like just opened up and  like a few sips were taken out of it so i was like all right i'm gonna start pouring this thing out i  start pouring the water bottle out people start looking at me like what the fuck is this asshole  doing is he rolling in his office yeah exactly rolling pours water all over the place when he gets  frustrated i go to my friend i said dude you gotta drink this bottle so he starts drinking this  opened unidentified bottle yeah this bottle that we found 
[03:28:00]  why don't you just go outside and pour it out because we were in the bus or just oh you're in  the bus right out the window like open up the window nothing because you can't open the windows  on a bus it's a fire it's a hipster bus it's a hipster bus too full for open windows exactly  needless to say i i was already cool enough in here we don't need to crack any windows man i was bent  over getting off the bus as soon as i got off the bus i pissed on these garbage cans and it was like  right on the service road cars are going by honking at me i didn't give a fuck at all 
[03:28:30]  you peed all over i peed all over and now every time i go by there i think it's it's mine it's  well it's my territory yeah the day i peed on the garbage cans uh... brian in new jersey this  is a good call  uh... first of all i feel like taking a piss but besides that um... yeah that actor from breaking  bad he was in that thing you do that tom hank that's what it was yeah and it's so uncomfortable  he's playing gus grissom and he looks uncomfortable  yeah it's not buzz aldrin it's it's got what's his last name gus 
[03:29:00]  gus grissom the guy who died in the uh... fire  right and he's on the he's on the show before the wonders are going on  the oneaters  the only it's onetters and uh... and right before they go on he's on there and he looks  see and he looks just like he did today with the skinny tie and everything which sal probably was like  oh i gotta get a tie that's getting i have multiple skinny ties and uh... and he goes well  i guess you could say it's out of this world if there's one thing that that ties sam and i 
[03:29:30]  together it's our undying love for that thing you do tom hanks wrote it too didn't  yeah it's a great move his production company now is uh... is playtone records  playtone records yeah i quit  i love that it's a great move one of the greatest moments in working and and this is a great song it is a great  song fountains of wayne does it right did that yes  yeah fountains of wayne did this you know yeah the wonders did it no no they did they they taught the wonders  how to play the instruments uh-huh like when they say we had to train and everything 
[03:30:00]  it's because they had to look like like steve zahn had to look like he was playing guitar he didn't actually have to play it  sounds great are you gonna tell your story yeah that's one of my favorite moments of working for this show  was when steve zahn and mila jovovich i think were both in at the same time to promote  whatever movie they were promoting this was the day that dice was in too  yeah and dice was in here and it was a weird show it was weird  because wasn't it was judd apatow in earlier  uh it might have been the same day yeah  because i think or i think they were talking about judd apatow with dice 
[03:30:30]  yeah yeah because i remember because it was either or dice came in two days in a row because  judd apatow was in here who's one of the biggest things in hollywood  and he was sitting in the chair that dice wanted to sit in and some dice  demanded to judd apatow that he moved judd of course being a comedy fan  moved for the dice man but we were outside  and we were getting stuff signed by steve zahn  and i brought in my that thing you do dvd  and i think eric would eric was the one who gave it to him 
[03:31:00]  and he said could you sign this for sam  it's his favorite movie and then steve zahn looked over at me and then he started sighing  and he goes that's so  gay  i was like yes  my chick was all excited because she was in that day because she's a huge mila jovovich fan  and uh my daughter was like just born so so she brought him she brought over there  and uh and steve zahn's talking to her  that's one thing you bring a kid in here  and you can talk to anybody you want  right elijah wood was just sitting there like baby talking 
[03:31:30]  i remember even when you're pregnant because i remember there's a picture  of your wife with 50 cent while she's pregnant  50 cent uh rubbed her belly because i guess that's good luck  yeah to rub a pregnant belly he's like let me get some of that luck and she's like um  okay  and guess what  but uh yeah  he's done pretty well since  her and steve zahn talked about uh diaper jeans  together because he was like a new father  all you have to do is bring a kid in here  so it was uh were the ladies disappointed that  aaron paul wasn't here 
[03:32:00]  well it's hard to be disappointed when brian cranston's here  the guy from that thing you do  yeah  but uh yeah you know  we were we were talking and and some other  high level people here were talking  about how bosses  no not i wouldn't say bosses  eric  no higher than eric  oh wow  uh about  it doesn't get high as far as i'm concerned as far as  i get spoken to  he doesn't get any higher than eric  higher or heavier  wow  sorry eric  i was saying higher  i was saying eric is the utmost 
[03:32:30]  authority  spider-man  that i go to  so  what will happen with these  everybody you know agrees  like do you watch the show  no  it would have been a great picture  the two of them together  the two of them together  well now  now i'm glad  that they didn't  why because we all didn't get it  no because then i would have eventually started watching the show  oh yeah  i've been very jealous of all of you  i mean they are the main  characters  and they're never together  like doing  not doing interviews  like in here  maybe like the today show you know  but not the opening  but yeah  i'm not 
[03:33:00]  who do i look like  savannah guthrie  no  i can't get that picture  so yeah  there's a mild level of disappointment  and i missed aaron paul last time he was here  he was here a year ago  and i missed him  oh yeah i remember  i copied his one sheet from last time  for today  um  um  i know that  and the uh  but the ladies got to meet elijah wood too  so i guess  i guess that was good  big celebrity  he is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet  he really is nice  he really is  and i i was excited because 
[03:33:30]  i forget  i was sitting there  and i remember when i was younger  watching elijah wood on some mtv show  and you know it was from a while  no it wasn't lord of the rings  that was a film  and you know it was from a while back  because elijah  there was actually uh video stores  like stores that sold movies  and elijah wood was going into one  and they were just following him around  uh saying you know  what movies do you like  what movies are you buying  and  he kept picking up movies  and he kept referring to them 
[03:34:00]  using one word  and it was the way he said this word  that stuck in my head for years and years  and today i couldn't remember  what that word was  until  he went  he said something to anthony  and he said  isn't it fantastic  and i said  that's the word  fantastic  what show  he goes  fantastic  it was on  i don't know  it was some mtv show  that just followed celebrities around  it didn't last long  oh  like it was actually him  yeah it was just elijah wood 
[03:34:30]  in a video store  picking out what movies he likes  it was like cribs  but not in his house  in a movie store instead  but it was entertaining  um  the other thing  oh by the way  good thing bob cowley  just texted me  because he just saw the chip video  and said the chip video  is hilarious  go to uh  facebook  slash opian anthony  and you can see  the first  chip  at ufc 148 video  uh  it's really uncomfortable  to watch  what's this 
[03:35:00]  justin in new mexico  yeah what's up man  how you doing  good good  how are you  i'm very well  thank you  awesome awesome  um i uh  two times  get the papers  get the papers  go ahead  oh sorry  here in albuquerque  that's actually where they film  breaking bad  oh yeah  and uh  there's like a  a pretty hipster area  right around uh  the university  it's called knob hill  and uh  knob hill  i know why  yeah knob hill  for the dicks  and i was  i was sitting down  right uh  right down at chiba 
[03:35:30]  it's like a little stoner bar  and stuff that we have here  and uh  aaron paul  was sitting out  on the patio  and uh  i had my dog with me  so he actually ended up  coming up and sitting at our table  and sitting with us  and having a few beers  but the guy's pretty damn cool  i've seen him down in knob hill  a couple times  and he's just like  real laid back  and pretty humble  i like him  i mean  he's like a chill dude  where all the bitches  going crazy  oh dude  the girls freaking  all the time  they flock to him  but  they love aaron paul  ladies love aaron paul  so you and danny  had to bring your  get out of here  justin you're just calling  to brag about having  lunch with aaron paul 
[03:36:00]  so all  you had to uh  you had to all bring  your girls in here  i didn't have to  but you know  like when when a situation  you know  the situation is another  one they like  yeah  when when a situation  arises that i feel  is possible  and they're like  they're like  oh my god  aaron paul turns me on  so much more than you  and you and danny  are like  fuck  i guess  all right  we'll bring it in  yeah but see  we bring them in  yeah  and then they're like  they can  they can unleash  their shades of gray  aaron paul  wild fantasies 
[03:36:30]  on you guys  tonight  am i right  exactly  but now it's just  going to be their  brian cranston fantasies  which are totally  different  they're all based on  interviewing him  when he's playing  an astronaut  it's totally  a different deal  altogether  i guess  but i mean  that's the same way  when i brought  jess in here  years ago  that's right  i forgot about that  to meet seth green  yeah  which she's not  which is weird  yeah and i don't even  i don't even think  she cares one way  or the other  about him anymore  taste change  she just loved the movie  can't hardly wait  i figured it out  it wasn't she just  loved can't hardly wait 
[03:37:00]  that much  that's a great movie  it is a great movie  it really is  it is a great movie  uh eric do you have any  what about your uh  your woman  is there anybody  that you have brought her up  because she gets wet for  or would  um  ozzy  oh yeah  well i remember when  she doesn't come up often  but for ozzy  she was really excited  and the cup  she came up for the cup  oh yes and the stanley cup  she's not gonna bang the stanley cup  well i mean  a guy could  yeah could she eric  she wants to  that's terrible  i had no idea  she was that 
[03:37:30]  well i won't even use the word  but you so far have said  she has the ability  to fuck the stanley cup  and she shit herself  definitely  maybe you should consult her  before you make these statements  i meant just like  rub up against it or something  oh you meant dry hump  the stanley cup  oh  okay well that's far more feasible  yeah you took it into a weird place  you  no no no no  you said she could fuck the stanley cup  that is true  okay  so i didn't take it into a weird place  you misspoke  can we leave it at that  all right fine 
[03:38:00]  that's fair  but is it  she's not  ozzy  she's not turned on by ozzy  is she  no  right  like that's not like  she's not putting  you sound disappointed  when you said that  no  i'm trying to think  if there's  well there's one person i know  who  if we ever got him on the show  who  perry ferrell  really  oh  and perry ferrell would probably  take her from you too  probably  he'll never  he exudes sexuality  exudes something  yeah oh yeah he does  he was on run and fez  in the k-rock days  yeah for satellite party  oh  right  you know  as a matter of fact 
[03:38:30]  if i remember right  i think lily was working with them  at the time  and i think there was some story  about perry ferrell  trying to get her  and his wife  to uh  do a threesome  i don't doubt it  he's a weird dude  you think he'd try to bang eric's wife  probably  and eric  he'd invite eric along  oh yeah  absolutely  eric if  perry ferrell  who you love famous people  you love a celebrity  don't you  okay  if perry ferrell  offered and said  i would like to do a threesome  with you and your wife  so it's you 
[03:39:00]  eric  eric nagle  perry ferrell  and your wife  keeping in mind  number one  this is a big celebrity  and you could take a  you could take a pic afterwards  and  and number two  it would obviously make your wife  very happy  would you do the threesome  i would opt out  what  wait  opt out  so you would let  you would step out  and let your wife  just bang perry ferrell  i'll pick you up  in half an hour  what the hell  is wrong with you  travis would you let  your wife bang  perry ferrell  no  no  of course not 
[03:39:30]  why would you  because she doesn't like  perry ferrell  but why would you  what if  okay  what if  would you let your wife  bang erin paul  no  no  why would you let  your wife  bang perry ferrell  who might have  stand in her way  oh my god  that's weird  what if he offered  to do the  dogs barking  at the beginning  of that song  yeah  yeah  what if he did that  then could he do  a threesome  with you  he has to play  the whole album  it's a little weird  he's busy  he's having a threesome  you'd really let  your wife  have sex with  perry ferrell  yeah  wow  sal if you were 
[03:40:00]  are you a single guy  if she wants to  i mean i'm assuming  that she wants to  wait wait  you also assume  that she shit herself  and that she could  fuck the stanley cup  my wife  she likes to shit herself  and fuck perry ferrell  why do you assume  she wants to fuck  perry ferrell  i know she loves him  but i don't know  if she'd be  he's probably right  in that assumption  yeah i would  i would think so  sal are you still  dating that girl  you were dating before  no no no  you ended that quick  huh  oh yeah  you are just  fucking  spreading that dick  around this city  aren't you 
[03:40:30]  well around brooklyn  yeah  only williamsburg  yeah  so uh  if you were  when was your  last serious  relationship  uh  a couple months  back  and how long  was that for  like a long time  okay so  who did she  what was her  celebrity  ah fuck  let's say  perry ferrell  we probably  haven't heard of him  yeah  yeah yeah  he's really big  but you guys  don't know him  he wears a very  deep in  yeah  would you let  your significant  other have sex  with her celebrity  no  no right  absolutely not  okay  and especially  not an inanimate  thing like a  fucking cup 
[03:41:00]  you wouldn't let  her i would let  just fuck the  stanley cup  if she had the  ability to  because if  jess had the  ability to have  sex with the  stanley cup  i'm sure that  i couldn't  satisfy her  now do i  get to have  sex with a  celebrity as  well  um  okay that  that's  that's  something  okay you  can have  sex with  perry ferrell  when she's  done  travis  who are you  gonna pick  keifer  yeah  yeah  yeah  if  would you let  your wife have  sex with  aaron paul  if it meant  you could have  sex with 
[03:41:30]  keifer  sutherland  i don't know  i mean  okay that's  enough of the  conversation right  there now  eric would  your wife let  you uh  have sex  who would be  the celebrity  for you  i don't know  i have to  think i know  it's difficult  the one i  wanted to is  not really in  the best of  shape anymore  who would it  paul abdul  no it used  to be christina  aguilera  okay but uh  you wouldn't  now just to  say you know  what i mean  i think if i  was allowed to  yeah i would 
[03:42:00]  definitely for  the story  now would  your wife let  you  i do not  think so  but you would  let your wife  have sex with  perry farrell  but i let you  have sex with  perry farrell  oh man  you're kidding  me i wish i'd  worked this out  ahead of time  let me see here  you done the  text with her  uh  yeah i mean  if jess if  that day when  jess came into  k-rock and met  seth green  if she had been  like oh my god  sam seth just  asked me out to 
[03:42:30]  dinner i'm gonna  go with him  and then maybe  have sex after  that i'd be  like no you  can't you're  not allowed  seth green i  would probably  laugh and say  okay  you're like  whatever if  that's if you  really want seth  green on your  roster go for  it eric i  believe is calling  his wife to  find out if he  wants to have  sex with  barry farrell  i'm trying to  clarify a text  you sent  what did you  what did it  just say shut  the fuck up  no it's over  yeah no uh  also chris 
[03:43:00]  cornell oh  there you go  also chris  cornell all  right would  you let your  wife get  double teamed  nothing to  clarify there  would you let  your wife get  double teamed  by no i'm  trying to figure  out did that  mean she came  down to get a  photo with him  no she did  she definitely  wants to sleep  every woman wants  to sleep with  chris cornell  every woman i've  never met a woman  who didn't want to  sleep with chris  cornell sal you  would fuck yeah  yeah i thought so  i'd be like man  he put out some of  the best albums of  the 90s i'd fuck  him sal would be  like hey i know  james eha  right right he  hates billy corgan  by the way 
[03:43:30]  let's have sex  let's have sex with  each other uh  eric would you let  your wife be  double teamed by uh  double team's a  little tough to  take okay how  about one after the  other then oh  man i wish we  could mark that  oh it's pro tool  running we don't  have that fucking  mic though try to  pull it out of  audition  what'd you just  say  nothing  would you let  her uh one  after the other  yeah it's chris  cornell it is  chris cornell and  how about this you  get a pic afterwards 
[03:44:00]  or you get you  can get a son you  can get four wife  is clarifying no  he's hot yeah  oh wow oh babe  you mean like you  went to get a  picture with him  right nope i  want to sleep with  him would you let  her sleep with  him well if we're  gonna it's chris  cornell it's chris  cornell how do you  say i'd rather  oh my god eric  is a cuckold  you'd rather chris  cornell than  perry pharrell right  oh yeah yeah  okay yeah  perry's got all  kind of weird shit  going on with him 
[03:44:30]  if you get one for  one no that's fine  i guarantee you  perry pharrell has  like two for something  yeah no i get to  pull that card you  know if i get the  celebrity opportunity  yeah but guess what  the way your  relationship seems to  work you'd be like  listen you had sex  with chris cornell i'm  gonna do my thing and  she'd be like no  you're not you'd be  like oh all right  i'm going to the  lego store then  man so you you  don't care who has  sex with your wife  i do i had sex with  your wife i don't  care as long as  you're a 90s alt 
[03:45:00]  rock guy yeah  exactly so what is  the most minimal  celebrity you let your  wife have sex with  mike myers  ew no why not  mike myers he's  bigger than perry  pharrell pasty and  doughy and he has to  be an attract someone  you're attracted to  not that i'm  attracted to but he  has to be somebody  that you consider  handsome for her to  sleep with yeah it  would have to be  someone she wanted  to yeah but what if  she said i want to  have sex with mike  myers that's  disgusting but would 
[03:45:30]  you let her no that  then i have a problem  but why because he's  not as handsome because  he's not at the level  of a chris cornell he's  bigger than perry  farrell i think yeah  but perry farrell's been  a lifelong obsession of  hers so okay that's  just a little treat for  her yeah what about  tj miller nobody  likes tj miller  especially not that  dame cook boy i  thought you wouldn't  let her have sex with  tj miller because that  could actually happen  no okay let's see  who else we can move  off this subject and  maybe find people that  jess wants to bang 
[03:46:00]  no because you know  what about the lead  singer from blues  traveler would you  let her have sex with  john popper or the  skinny one skinny  skinny no oh what  if he played the  harmonica so fat  is no what if he  dressed her up like  dorothy from the  runaround music video  oh there you go  no no no good  album i we can  play it you can  talk about whoever  jess whatever  celebrities jess would  want to sleep with  but it's not as  intriguing because for  me i would say no  she can't have sex  with any of them 
[03:46:30]  whereas you said yes  to perry farrell and  yes to chris cornell  and the stanley cup  and yes she could  dry hump the stanley  cup now would she  let you have anal sex  with one of the pegs  on the world series  trophy eric i'm not  answering that that's  just fucking stupid  well you said she  could dry hump the  stanley cup if she  wanted to she wouldn't  so what is where do  you draw the line on  celebrities that she's 
[03:47:00]  not allowed to have  sex with how about  bob kelly would you  let her sleep with bob  kelly if she wanted to  look there was a time  skinny bob kelly might  have been in the  you might have been  concerned okay let's  see how about opie what  if opie was like eric i  wanted oh what if what  if your wife came to  you and she was like  listen i know this is  weird but i gotta tell  you i've been a fan of  the show for a long time  i know you work there so  it's different but i've  always fantasized about  uh a sexual encounter  with opie would you be 
[03:47:30]  like you know what once  you can do it one time  and that's where it  stands you can have  your night of passion  no why no no why  because she's not  interested in him i'm  what about eric some  discussion we were  talking about earlier  with opie and anthony  oh with opie and  eric eric would be  like no then she would  have to stand aside  no eric you're not  following my hypothetical  i am what if she was  very interested in him  and it was just as a  fan then no why no 
[03:48:00]  because no who are you  calling don't worry  about it are you  calling opie to find  don't ask her i won't  be able to say no  who are you calling  who's he calling in  there hey hang on a  second well who's he  who are you talking  to what a mysterious  guy this eric is by  the way i love she's  adding to the list  put her on speaker  put her on speaker i  want to know who else  is on the list all 
[03:48:30]  right i gotta start  writing down i can't  put her on i hope i  don't get writer's  cramp no um so we  got chris cornell  okay chris cornell  perry farrell who  else is on her  stanley cup stanley  cup you're right  sorry travis i forgot  about that but that's  just for dry humping  um a lot of men have  been inscribed on that  too dry i'm putting a  dh next to stanley cup  so we know why dry  hump oh yep just so  we know who else is  now on added to your  wife's uh celebrity  sleep with list well 
[03:49:00]  you want to play a  little game it's  somebody we've  recently had on now  i'm not gonna ask you  i want the list but  i'm not gonna ask you  whether you're she's  allowed to or not yet  okay so this is just  her list somebody that  we've had on recently  sal you have a guest  oh yeah who is it  corgan you think it's  billy corgan yeah yeah  yeah is it billy  corgan eric no it is  not really you are  along the same lines as  90s rockers i understand  is it troy no call her  and find out if she  wants to have sex with  troy no interest in  troy okay um that's a 
[03:49:30]  surprise but okay troy  is uh joe de rosa pretty  is it joe de rosa no  have we had him in more  than once yes kevin  smith is it no okay now  when was the last time we  had him in it's a him  a few weeks ago and it  is a him it's a him okay  uh is it a musician or an  actor uh neither comedian  uh i i guess spoken word  artist no kind of a 
[03:50:00]  comedian i guess you can  add comedian to his  credits but he's not a  tv star or a movie star  well he's a tv star he's  a talk show host oh  jimmy fallon there you  go wow jimmy fallon man  that's gotta hurt you eric  because you want to work  for jimmy fallon oh yeah  jimmy fallon's a good  looking guy i can't work  anywhere he's super  handsome well all these  guys are so handsome  chris cornell pharrell handsome  he's got he exudes  sexuality a lot of women  love perry pharrell yeah 
[03:50:30]  because he's so like out  there right i hate it all  right so jimmy fallon's on  the list really not and  eric dwight doesn't who  else is on the list that's  all i know can you call her  and ask her i just did for  a complete she said she  just gave me the third one  can you call her just real  quick you don't have to do  it on the air you can turn  off your mic i'll talk to  travis and just call her and  see if you can get a  complete listing so we can  have everything on the  record because this is a  valuable thing because this  is the type of thing that  will come up when couples  argue you know or let's say 
[03:51:00]  eric's wife ends up sleeping  with somebody and then he  wasn't on the list exactly  that's why i feel like we  need to get everything on the  record and it's on the air and  it's clarified yeah eric if  you can hear me in your one  headphone find out if trent  resner is on the list guys  like that because trent  resner do you think it's a  big list yeah it's a big list  and by the way i think it's a  big list that he would give  permission to as well and uh i  don't i don't i don't think  she would give him permission  for any of them no none of  them none of his list although i 
[03:51:30]  don't think he'd be able to  seal the deal either so it's not  it's not a concern of hers she's  charming but i believe that she  would be able to seal the deal  with some of these guys because  she's a good-looking girl what  there's three more there's three  more for now three no no this  rounds out the list okay let's  run out the list and who is are  we guessing or are you just  gonna give us the names um do  it's i think it's more fun to  guess right okay uh are they  all uh along the same line of  work um same in they're all 
[03:52:00]  entertainers obviously no are  they all is any of them  musicians no okay no more  musicians no so maryland manson  and trent resner are not on the  list no trent res did you confirm  that trent resner is definitely  not on the list you know at one  point i would have suspected but  i don't think that that he's on  the list ever since he showed up  for the academy awards he's on my  list fuck he is on your list oh  yeah even after the sal loves  trent resner oh never mind  there's a text okay trent  resner's good yeah okay trent  resner is on the list what about  pete steel from typo negative  you're getting too deep no okay

[03:56:30]  the brothers from the oreo commercials oh  yeah is it eli manning it's eli manning  isn't it  eli manning okay so this is the list and  we're gonna go down and see who she's  allowed to sleep with and who she's not  chris cornell she is allowed to sleep  with yes check perry farrell she is  allowed to sleep with yes check stanley  cup she's allowed to dry hump that's at  her discretion i know all these are if she  wants to she's allowed to though she's  allowed okay yes she's allowed to try on 
[03:57:00]  stanley cup jimmy fallon she is allowed  to sleep with that's i don't know it's  jimmy fallon he's a friend of the show  eric and also he might be he might be the  show host one day yeah and you want to  work for him so bad that's not gonna  happen if he doesn't sleep with your  wife all right then yeah okay jimmy  fallon yes trent resner no why no i  think you'd fall into the same category  what what if he's i say no but i think  she'd do it anyway yeah she would okay  trent resner is really cool check off 
[03:57:30]  yes okay martin bro door no yeah i know  you would have to let her too old too  old yeah but she's a huge double but  wait wait what happens he brings a  stanley cup while he bangs her which  she's already she can get a two for one  no but things he he can play with the  stanley cup while he's banging would you  let her bang martin bro door while you  played with the stanley cup in the other  room you could use legos he's actually  thinking about it would you do it uh you  could play with the stanley cup and you  could run around for bro door i'd say 
[03:58:00]  yeah okay yeah you gotta do uh derrick  no number number two derrick jeter no why  no because he fucks everything yeah that's  true i would say no i think eric it's the  race thing personally yeah well you're  probably right is it the race no it's not  the race i agree with eric in that one so  i'm gonna x out derrick jeter and  finally eli manning  here's this what about corky from life  goes on eli manning she's married to  corky has it oh has a sweet deal eric you 
[03:58:30]  know the commercials yeah what if he  gives you a case of oreos while he's  banging your wife in the other room and a  toyota no and you get a toyota and a  glass of milk a toyota or a toy yoda you  would rather the toyota yeah yeah it's a  lego toyota it's a car why wouldn't you  let her bang eli manning because she's  never been like i mean she's been a  lifelong giants fan but right she's been  a lifelong bro door fan not a look eric  he's got two super bowl rings these are  some guys she wants to sleep with she 
[03:59:00]  one dudes i was gonna say she wants to  feel the super bowl rings inside of her  but then i thought better of it then i  thought better of it so i won't say it  that's horrible i know i'm not gonna say  it i will not is there anybody from  true blood though you think no she's not  no we so eli manning's a no no why yes  he was if he before he bangs like i've  been pretty lenient with the others what  if he lets you play catch what if he  lets you wear his jersey and you care  about football or or you play catch  with him after yeah i would roland you're 
[03:59:30]  the only one who wants to play catch who's  an adult however we now have the  quintessential list of the one two three  four five men that eric's wife is allowed  to sleep with one trophy and one  inanimate object she's allowed to dry  hump um but she probably wouldn't let  you she probably wouldn't let you you  know wouldn't return the favor that's  fair no i think after that list and she  would say the whole list you get one we  go one for five here in the nagel 
[04:00:00]  household has she changed her name to  nagel or no yeah did she really no no  i'm sorry to hear that um wow and you  don't feel insecure at all no like even  if even if it like if it happened you'd  be fine with it  i'd like to know about it like details no  like that it was going to happen i would  feel very insecure like especially like  somebody like would you have to wear  arita's ice why this happens or it can  be at the house where are rita's ice  yeah wait no you wait arita's ice why 
[04:00:30]  it's happening  i don't know he's just bringing up  rita's water ice i don't know why um  delicious coming in tomorrow he wants  free so  um i hope we were talking about you  during a sex conversation  wouldn't you feel insecure by the way i  saw roland's shameless tweet over the  weekend about that sauce place yeah they  gave him that plant parmesan it's too  much  it's too much like it's bordering on  grossly illegal at this point it's my 
[04:01:00]  own twitter yeah it's it's personal  you got you got some sauce over the  weekend  they fuck themselves they have a  problem with my twitter well no they  don't have a problem with your twitter  they have a problem with your twitter  leading to free mentions on the air  i i didn't mention them no it's just  on twitter i'm the one on twitter yeah  you're right you're right  i was looking down the hall i don't  um i have to go i don't feel too well  okay i may have to go home he's  there are people in the back who are  mad at him yeah because the guest  stuff today um that's why he's

[04:02:00]  yeah what is up wayne knight's ass that  he can't do anything yeah i mean you'd  say it was the let's just say it's part  of seinfeld crew let's just say this  guest was out of this world  right so brian cranston didn't do any of  the shows and uh you're getting a little  heat for that rolling yeah he takes in  the ass you're getting dig well i mean  listen your job is to what book for the  guys the opie and anthony show what's  up so it's like you do your job and 
[04:02:30]  you get a dick in the ass if you  hadn't booked any guests today what  would you have ended up with in your  ass a dick a major one right so either  way it's not my fault because i forgot  to tell people because it was like  during that parties tacos and july  4th weekend yeah a lot of shit was  happening right i didn't entertain  people and right barbecue i mean we  talked yesterday about all the  appetizers you know yes in the barbecue  and then people inviting other friends  over and then people coming over then 
[04:03:00]  taking people to watch waters and all  of a sudden brian cranston's in here  and you're like listen all i did was  book for the show i did my job i hope  that they don't put i'm just an  innocent victim in all this um eric you  sure you wouldn't have a problem going  back to your wife after she was with  like wouldn't you feel inadequate like  i would feel inadequate after like  perry ferrell and chris cornell and  all these rock stars and everything you  wouldn't be like oh how do i don't  exactly measure up to these guys they  can sing to her too yeah you overthink  things you're a simple kind of man 
[04:03:30]  huh ever you're like look i'll put it  in when i put it in and when i don't  i'll be downstairs with my legos and  dvds drinking coke floats and eating  cookies that's the life though yeah i  mean look it doesn't sound too bad  that sounds awesome it doesn't sound  too bad or i'm tricking opie on  twitter how much does it satisfy you  that opie is the one who's falling for  all your twitter jokes not my problem  do you enjoy that that's a good one  though because eric today opie said he  was pissed that you were he didn't say  a word to me until it was on the air i 
[04:04:00]  had no idea that would that you i don't  think that he's going to i brought it up  yeah before the show he was like what he  was saying it before the show and i  brought it up on the air but um yeah he  said uh today on the air he said he was  pissed that you were in his life  oh is that because he keeps falling for  the twitter jokes okay not my problem are  you gonna keep him going no it served  its purpose you're not gonna keep  doing twitter pranks why am i gonna keep  doing the same thing over and over no  eric different twitter pranks like there  was one twitter prank yourself if  something comes along then maybe which  was the bobo q twitter prank which was 
[04:04:30]  epic and then there was me on that one  no opie then there was the big uh uh  spam thing that opie talked to you about  on the air today he keeps falling for  your your twitter but well listen you  can keep up with eric's twitter pranks on  eroc radio um i enjoy them i don't it's  the most infuriating twitter feed on the  internet he just keeps going and go he  can't stop it makes me laugh though because  after two hours later you go you go oh he's  uh what's worse eric's uh bits on twitter 
[04:05:00]  or roland's constant pandering for free  food at least actually i don't know i think  eric's bits on twitter are worse because  you you you and sometimes sometimes we  benefit from roland's pandering yeah always  we always benefit i just feed the people  i don't introduce any of this stuff to  you it's just you guys are you see it and  then you just get all eric you tweeted  94 times about a movie that you  pretended was a bobo queue everybody saw  we follow you yeah i'll tell you one
