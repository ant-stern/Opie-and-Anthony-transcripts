<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a "Worst Of" segment hosted by comedian Mark Maron, who openly expressed his confusion regarding his unpaid participation while repeatedly plugging his podcast, WTF with Mark Maron.  This transitioned into a segment featuring in-studio guest Al Jorgensen of Ministry.  Jorgensen regaled listeners with tales of his career, including setting a tour bus on fire with fireworks, a disastrously timed marriage proposal at Graceland utilizing an escape door and Elvis-themed speakers, a brown recluse spider bite that almost resulted in arm amputation, and the amputation of his big toe due to a neglected splinter.  He also shared his negative opinions on contemporary music and his political views, expressing his disdain for George W. Bush, and even briefly addressed a listener's reference to him using the moniker "Al-Qaeda."  Joe Rogan and Bill Burr made brief appearances, seemingly watching Fear Factor on TV in the studio.

Following Jorgensen's interview, the show delved into an extended bit involving a vintage couch, jokingly referred to as a "lesbian couch," brought in by a female guest, Erica.  The hosts, using a malfunctioning blacklight, searched for semen stains, finding a few (and a condom), and ultimately concluding it was relatively clean.  Erica discussed her postponed wedding due to financial troubles stemming from her mother's closed consignment furniture store (which the hosts hilariously promoted for its "splooge stain" collection).  She gifted Opie a small dish (which he promptly broke), beer pitchers, and a hatbox containing 1940s poker chips and playing cards.  Opie's clumsy handling of the poker chips, causing them to spill and injure Erica's foot, resulted in significant tension and a subsequent apology from the hosts.  The guest departed visibly upset.  The segment concluded with the hosts playing listener-submitted audio, including a darkly humorous song titled "Why Did My Mommy Kill Me?".

Next, the show featured Pat Allen, a Jets fan arrested at an Indianapolis Colts game, along with his father, Tom Allen, and their lawyer, Ron Sage.  Audio of Pat's arrest, obtained from YouTube, was played, revealing a heated, profanity-laden exchange with police officers. Pat recounted his version of events, claiming wrongful arrest for cursing, throwing beer, and taunting fans, alleging police overreaction and a potentially racially motivated targeting due to his Jets jersey.  Sage detailed his plans to pursue legal action, focusing on the alleged inaccuracies in the police report and the officers' behavior.  The segment devolved into a chaotic exchange between callers, the hosts, and the guests, filled with profanity and insults.

A listener-request segment followed, focusing heavily on Stan Meyer, the inventor of the purported water-powered car, with speculation about his mysterious death, suggesting potential foul play.  This was followed by an extremely profane and graphic bit about Bill O'Reilly's grandmother and the Harlem Globetrotters, and a lengthy, irreverent mocking of Celine Dion's post-Hurricane Katrina appearance on Larry King Live. The segment concluded with a discussion of the Charlie Daniels Band's "The Devil Went Down to Georgia."  The implied presence of Maury Povich was mentioned later in this segment.

A subsequent segment featured Eddie Trunk, promoting his new hard rock and heavy metal book.  The discussion centered on Trunk's curated playlists, leading to heated debates about essential songs from bands such as Van Halen, Kiss, Iron Maiden, and Rush.  The segment included several song plays and digressions about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Jay Moore had to leave the studio due to severe neck pain.

The show's final segment began with a discussion about the underrated band Ella and the impact of grunge on the music scene, specifically Jane's Addiction and Nirvana's influence on the shift from glam metal.  The segment concluded with a promotion for the listener-submitted "Worst of Opie and Anthony" content, expressing some reservations about the quality of previous submissions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Um, normally, these two tools decide what you'll be hearing on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Sam.  And this is E-Roc.  Yeah!  Dickheads.  However, you call, email, tweet, it, step back, and scream that you could do a much better job of selecting bits than they can.  So now, not so much as a thank you for years of faithful support, but more to stifle your bitching and complaining. 
[00:00:30]  We're giving you the opportunity to pick your favorite moments from the show.  I need to hear, I gotta hear, so if you guys can play that again, that would be great.  I love that damn thing.  That's what got me hooked on you guys.  Opie and Anthony presents the All Requests Worst Of Show.  Call 877-4-WORST-OF and tell us what you want to hear.  And remember, if it sucks, it's your own damn fault.  Hey folks, it's Mark Maron, and I'm sort of hosting this listener request show for O&A. 
[00:01:00]  Why?  I don't fucking know.  They're not paying me.  Oh wait, I know.  It's to plug my podcast.  It's WTF with Mark Maron.  It's available on iTunes and at WTFpod.com.  You can also get my stand-up dates there, so you can see if I'm in your neighborhood or your town or your state.  However far you want to drive, man.  It's up to you.  All right, so I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing here.  I just did the show with O&A, and then I was brought into a studio, and they told me I should read this shit. 
[00:01:30]  And now it's got something to do with you guys requesting stuff.  And then they did it some other way, and now we're doing it this way.  All right, fuck it.  So let's just do this.  And can I get paid for this?  Is there any way I can get any money for this at all?  No.  All right.  All right, can I get people to go to WTFpod.com?  Sure.  All right, go to WTFpod.com, and let's do this thing.  You're already calling 877-4WORSTOV.  That's 877-496-7786, and requesting the Opie and Anthony material you want to hear. 
[00:02:00]  Then the computer sorts it out and then plays it.  That being said, let's see how many requests we have today and get this shit started.  Today's listener request voicemail has 10 new messages.  First message.  And this is Gail in Rockland County, and I'd like to request Al Jorgensen setting the tour bus on fire with the colorful fireworks. 
[00:02:30]  Always a very funny bit.  Thanks.  Message deleted.  Request Worst of Show.  Nice.  Ministry. 
[00:03:00]  This is murder music, man.  You just have to kill people with this.  I love it.  It rocks!  Let's get Al Jorgensen in here.  Yeah.  He's a legend.  We are just some no-class motherfuckers in here.  We go out and get a bottle of wine, and can't even get, like, one nice wine glass to have around here.  He's drinking it out of one of the Starbucks cups.  Starbucks I ever had.  Yeah?  Best Starbucks I ever had.  I was saying, though, we're some no-class motherfuckers.  We should have had some wine glasses or something.  You know those cheesy corporate parties you go to where they have those snapped-together wine glasses, those plastic ones? 
[00:03:30]  Even one of those would have been better than a Starbucks cup.  I think it kind of ruins the wine when you pour it in that wax-coated cup.  He doesn't give a shit.  Look at him.  Nah.  Oh, let me get your mic on.  There you go.  Hey, Al.  Welcome to Satellite Radio, buddy.  Pinkies up?  Pinkies up.  Pinkies.  How's the wine?  It was 40 bucks.  Not good enough.  Hawk pulled it out of his ass.  Pretty good?  Then good enough.  Not bad?  Yeah, it's not bad.  You like it?  I can't pronounce it, but it's not bad. 
[00:04:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, try to pronounce that.  Oh, Breton, Larry, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier.  Yeah, Marco, that's what it is.  You were a wine aficionado?  Is that what people are saying?  I used to be until I got here today, man.  Ah, see.  We don't fuck.  What do we know?  We suck.  Dude, he's got your beat over here.  What was he got?  Red Bull?  No, fuck the Red Bull.  He's been eating pot lollipops.  Pot lollipops.  That's Joe Rogan from Fear Factor, by the way. 
[00:04:30]  What's up, dude?  And that's Bill Burr, a very funny guy to you right there.  Uh-oh.  Some kind of...  Good job.  I'm just watching Joe on TV.  There's some poor broad hanging from a landing gear of an airplane.  Yeah, Fear Factor's on right now.  How is this legal?  How is it even legal?  Do you remember doing this one, Joe?  Vaguely?  Vaguely.  I don't know.  There's something in airplanes.  I was probably thinking about Pluto or something while this was going on.  There you are, man.  Ooh, what a nice shirt. 
[00:05:00]  Wearing a nice burgundy shirt.  You look all concerned.  You look all concerned.  With big tits on.  Very concerned.  What are you, yelling into some earpiece in her ear?  No, she can't hear me.  Nah.  No.  You just stand below.  Look at the high up there.  That is really high up, man.  Yeah.  3,000 feet or something.  That's some scary shit.  Do you have a contingency plan for people dying?  Have you guys talked about what if someone dies?  I think what they're going to do is if somebody dies, they're going to gun everybody down and  blame it on the terrorists.  Is that it?  Don't let the terrorists take away your fear factor.  With new host, Adam Carollo.  Wait. 
[00:05:30]  All right.  I think Nicole and Stephanie are going to do it.  I'm going to be shocked if they do it.  It's hard.  All right.  It's nice meeting you.  Take it easy.  Get out of here.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye, Tiffany.  I'm going to shake off.  You're just psyched now.  You're good.  People are left and I'm out of here.  I would have left and I'm out of here.  I like the walk of shame.  Yeah, the walk of shame is the best.  Just get the fuck out of here, you failure.  That's so dumb.  He hates doing that show.  Come on.  Who wouldn't want this show, though? 
[00:06:00]  But he's so serious.  It's like he says.  You go on.  Everyone else has to do the work.  Everyone else is climbing around on aircraft and being dropped into vats of dog shit.  I'll show something cool right now.  I can do a handstand for like 30 seconds.  Say it, baby.  Come on.  Yeah.  Damn.  I used to make my sister do handstands and nightgowns.  My sister's friends.  That's pretty badass.  Wonderful.  And my sister.  You ready?  Yeah.  Go get some masks.  I'm betting on you.  All right.  I can't say that anymore, by the way. 
[00:06:30]  Why?  I can't say kick ass anymore.  Can't say that.  Why?  They told you not to say that.  Not only that, they told me I can't say hell anymore.  I can't say, all right, let's get the hell out of here.  You can't say hell.  Are you kidding?  No, no, no.  The lowest rung on the bad word food chain.  That is the lowest rung.  Yeah.  Hell?  Yeah.  An imaginary world where the bad guy lives in a land of fire.  You can't fucking say that anymore.  How fucking stupid are people?  You can't say hell anymore.  Whoa!  That's like the only progress we've made in regards to religion is that if you bring 
[00:07:00]  up the devil, people think you're fucking crazy.  You can talk about God all you want.  You know, the president can talk about God on television, but if you ever got on TV and  said, we found Satan in Afghanistan and we're tracking him by radar, you'd be like,  okay, what the fuck?  Satan's bad.  Right, but if there's a God, there's got to be a Satan, right?  Doesn't it work like that?  They never talk about it.  What about cock and pussy?  Those are two different things you could contest, right?  I don't think if you can't say hell, I'd be willing to say cock and pussy on Fear Factor  out of the question.  You have cats on Fear Factor?  Cocks are roosters and pussy is a cat, right? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, I don't think that...  You know that wouldn't fly?  You can't hold up a dead cat and Joe Rogan will say, you have to eat this pussy to get  through to the next level.  I don't see it happening.  That's got to be legal.  Yeah, to paddle the cock, which is this rooster in a cage here.  Eat the pussy to paddle the cock.  You're afraid of the cock, are you?  Afraid of the cock, little lady?  Our kid's Fear Factor?  A bunch of people want to say hi to Al.  Let's go to Tim in Illinois.  Go away! 
[00:08:00]  What's up, Tim?  Uh, Al, I used to love eating lots of acid and listening to your music back in the day.  Me too.  Eating lots of acid.  I'm getting drunk.  Thanks, dude.  Uh, I ain't got shit else to say.  Punch it out.  Wow.  That's all he had?  Well, that was pretty enlightening.  A lot of people give you big respect there, Al.  Ministry was the single most important influence in the sound and concept of Nine Inch Nails.  Trent Reznor, 2005.  He said that?  Hell yeah.  What a pussy cuck. 
[00:08:30]  Hell.  Hell.  And, uh, Scott Ian from Anthrax said, uh, I'm not a religious man, but I've been a faithful  follower and member of Al's ministry for over 20 years.  He's got that right.  He's not a religious man.  Yeah, I know that.  Well, you've been around a long time.  What do you think of today's music?  I think I'm getting pretty old.  Is that it?  I'm like, what, 69, 70 years old now or some shit?  Hold it up.  25 years.  That's, that's gross, man.  25 years. 
[00:09:00]  My liver is pissed.  I've been in this music business that long, man.  Do you listen to anything new or?  No.  No?  You don't like it all?  I really do hate it.  Really?  I watch Fear Factor and wait for them to say cock and pussy and that about takes up my whole  night, all right?  You'll never get a straight answer.  We've got two people in the studio that hate what they're doing.  All right.  Joe.  But it pays well.  Oh, that's funny.  But it pays well.  No, he, he obviously, um, does it.  What is it?  Your chat there.  I thought I saw a Blue Oyster Cult thing going on there. 
[00:09:30]  That is a Blue Oyster Cult thing going on.  That's, shows you again.  I mean, that was like, what, 1931?  They got me through the war.  The big one.  The big one.  He's got hermits, hermits across his back.  This guy's going to be around forever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of people giving you legendary status.  Oh, yeah.  Just saying you're a fucking legend.  Uh-oh.  That's not, I don't know how good a thing that is in, in rock music.  Well, it gets me out of some speeding tickets, but. 
[00:10:00]  Does it?  Other than that, it's not really worth much.  Yeah.  What do you do with yourself these days?  Touring?  Uh, not yet.  No?  No.  Recording?  It's the big one coming up.  The big one's coming up?  Yeah, we got Revolting Cox opening for ministry on this tour, which is going to probably require  an oxygen tank for me when I'm done doing both shows, right?  Come out in a walker for ministry, I think, but.  Can't be that old.  I'm getting there, dude.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I'm 46. 
[00:10:30]  My liver's about 91, so it gets a little bit hard.  Live the life, uh, the whole time you've been, uh.  Just pump a bunch of Viagra before each show.  I don't think you need a hard-on.  I could just get a cucumber.  Half of the sandwich.  Gets in the way of the guitar.  He's playing it so far from his place.  Hey, wait a second.  If you play your guitar over your cock, you're not a guitar player.  You gotta be able to hang it down over your cock, so you gotta wear your guitars low. 
[00:11:00]  I hate those guys that wear the high waistband golf pants and then wear their guitars up  higher like those old jazz cats.  That's disgusting, man.  That's like back in the 60s, the early 60s, the English guys were way up high like that.  Exactly.  George Harrison was way up high like that.  Disgusting.  Yeah.  You gotta wear it sling like a gun.  That's what he died from.  It's like high guitar disease.  Is that it?  Yeah.  He gave him a tumor when he was being up so close to his chest.  Let's go to Rev on Wackbag.  Rev, what's up?  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to ask Al if he got any shit from anyone on the religious right for 
[00:11:30]  nicknamed himself Al-Qaeda for a while there.  Oh.  Did you call yourself Al-Qaeda?  I was Al-Qaeda, and then I was Al-Jazeera, and I've been Al-Lots of things.  Alchemy, aluminum, alcohol, you name it.  So, I mean, that was just a little phase.  Yeah?  Yeah, I got shit from the right.  I mean, why wouldn't I?  That's awesome.  And that's what you were gunning for?  I love those guys, man.  I mean, for a while, they had me on some religious right website that had me like public enemy 
[00:12:00]  number two behind Michael Moore, which was...  Wow.  That was pretty good.  It's hard to get past Michael Moore.  That's sweet.  In a lot of different ways.  Yeah, yeah.  Hard to get around them.  Yeah, so why did you choose that?  Just to give them shit, or...  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.  Yeah.  Not a big fan of Bush, are you?  I wouldn't think you're a fan of Al-Qaeda, though, either.  No, I'm not a fan of any of them bastards, you know?  I'm a fan.  Either side, right?  You know, some are fans.  Alcohol, fanned.  Al-Qaeda, not a fan. 
[00:12:30]  That's a handy name to have.  Isn't it?  It's great, yeah.  Anything behind it like that.  Not a fan of Bush, obviously.  No, no.  No?  You'll never see Al Bush, either.  No, no.  What did you think of the last election of John Kerry?  Did you vote for him, or did you think he was another asshole?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No, I mean, it's just...  The whole special interest group thing that runs the government is what we really got to  dismantle.  These little prop-up cardboard cutouts that they put up.  The problem with Bush, here's the problem with Bush. 
[00:13:00]  In a sense, I almost appreciate Reagan now, because at least Reagan knew he wasn't running  things.  He was just acting as president, right?  Yeah.  As an actor.  And Bush actually thinks he is.  Yeah.  Which is creepy.  I mean, he actually thinks he's running things and shit.  We were talking in the office about Bush and how much...  Like, I just can't stand him.  And I was a supporter of him early on.  And when you look at somebody, even like Reagan or Clinton, for that matter, two opposite  ends of the spectrum, you remember during their presidency, them sitting at their desk 
[00:13:30]  at the Oval Office and signing shit.  Yeah.  Whatever they were doing, it was a bill for the environment, or it was some kind of tax  thing that Reagan was doing that no one liked, but he felt strongly about it or something.  It was something.  You never see Bush in the Oval Office working.  No, he...  The guy has done nothing as far as getting this clearing list.  Listen, you know what was cool about Clinton and all them shots of him signing shit in 
[00:14:00]  the Oval Office is you know he was getting a Hummer underneath the desk at the same time.  Yeah.  Or he had to move the page because, like, he's got a cum stain on it.  Imagine, like, some fucking important bill.  You put it on your desk and a little cum starts seeping through where you signed it and smudges  your signature.  How wonderful that is.  But you never see Bush doing anything.  He's always giving the same fucking speech every time.  He's up there, evil El Cata, we gotta deal with...  You know, it's always about freedom.  Pretty good.  We're staying the course and do it. 
[00:14:30]  And he's never working as president.  What do you think about the Inquirer's story that he's drinking?  Yeah.  Again, you think so?  Absolutely.  Well, I think the Inquirer reported this a couple days ago.  His poll numbers are, like, what, 31% approval?  His poll numbers are in the shitter.  He's got the war.  He's got two fucking major disasters that were...  One of them, you know, the first one, at least, a complete...  He's probably back on the crack, too.  Well, someone else has said that he's...  I think so, because, you know, if you're president, you know you've got a good deal.  What room do you go to to smoke crack if you're the president? 
[00:15:00]  What room is here?  Sure enough.  That's a basement thing.  That's got to be a cube with no window.  Incoming nuclear weapon from Russia.  That's the room that's left over.  Right.  That's the room you smoke crack in.  Imagine having that kind of power, though, man.  One time, I wound up at this party with Ronald Reagan Jr.  Yeah.  Okay, so the first thing I asked him was, like, have you ever beat off in the White House?  I mean, it's like, I had to ask...  Is that the first?  That's the very first thing, because I've always wondered that.  It's like, you know, did you put on Nancy's dresses and kind of whack it and, like, pretend 
[00:15:30]  to pick up the red phone and start a nuclear war?  Some kind of crazy shit, right?  Sure.  So I asked him that.  Give him a lollipop, man.  And he was like, no, no, no, no, no.  I never beat off in the White House.  I'm like, get out of here.  That's the first thing I would do if I ever was invited to the White House.  I'd go beat off in every room.  It'd just be a gas, right?  Jackin' in the Lincoln bedroom.  Jackin' in the Lincoln room, right?  But he denied it.  So I finally just kept on him and on him.  He goes, all right, all right, all right.  When I was nine and my dad lived in the governor's office, I did let my Labrador retrievers pee 
[00:16:00]  on me on the front lawn.  I'm like, you'll admit to that, but you won't admit to whacking it in the  White House?  There's a golden shower from his dog.  That's fucked up, man.  He's a strange guy.  Yeah, he is, man.  Ronald Reagan Jr. was always a strange guy.  Yeah, they kind of tried to keep him under wraps, and then he got a lot of publicity.  Hardcore Democrat.  Yeah.  Yeah, weird.  Kind of against his dad.  Strange guy.  But like I was saying, though, at least back then.  He can't be a Democrat.  He didn't whack it in the White House.  He's not a good Democrat.  Yeah, I'm not a Democrat, are you? 
[00:16:30]  Ask Al about ministry as piss army.  What is that?  That's kind of like our kiss army.  Kiss army.  It's the golden version of the kiss army.  All right.  What do you think of other guys that are supposedly the legendary status, like guys from Kiss?  Gene Simmons.  You see him out there hawking his stuff.  Yeah, that's kind of weird. 
[00:17:00]  I'm not really into that, man.  No.  I mean, it's like, well, I'm also jealous, too.  He says he's, what, had sex with 11,000 women a year or something.  You've got a wedding ring on it.  I think the caliber of those.  Yeah, I've got a wedding ring.  I have sex with one gal a year.  We were just talking about marriage.  Well, not once a year, but once a year.  Right, right.  Joe Rogan, not a fan of marriage.  She doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me.  Yeah.  How long you been married?  Uh, what?  Three.  Oops, I'm in trouble.  Oh, is that her right there?  Yeah.  There you go.  How long? 
[00:17:30]  Three years.  Three years.  Yeah, three beautiful, golden, amazing years.  There you go.  Things going well?  Yeah.  Sign a prenup?  No.  No?  I'm fucked.  You are so screwed, my friend.  That's it.  Way to fucking go.  Half those paths are hers.  His next tour will be playing a ukulele.  A ukulele.  Coffee houses and bongos for me, man. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, wow.  Not that she isn't lovely, and I'm sure you two get along, but what made you get married?  We were at Graceland.  Yeah?  Believe it or not, that's the answer.  And that does it?  I don't know.  Elvis?  Some kind of magic, weird shit.  We got married at Graceland.  You see a vision?  Get married.  Lose all your shit.  No, Graceland is bizarre to get married in, man.  They have all these...  You got married in Graceland?  In Graceland, yeah.  All right?  At the little chapel behind in his backyard or whatever.  And as you go all through Graceland, they have all these fucking rocks that are like, 
[00:18:30]  you know, fake rocks, fake things that have speakers in it that whenever you pass by the  rock, it has some kind of motion sensor, and it says Elvis thing, so you think you're  losing your fucking mind the whole time you're walking around there.  Elvis?  You're like, hey, man, don't worry.  It's going to be okay.  It's all going to be okay, man.  Go ahead and get married, man.  It's all right.  Really?  Seriously.  It's creepy.  He's the most whored-out performer ever.  Elvis Cooper.  Oh, yeah.  I went there, and I wanted to laugh at him, and I actually went into his house, and I  felt bad for him. 
[00:19:00]  Like, I wanted to laugh at all his furniture and shit, and it's just like, people just  walking up to his grave, taking pictures and shit.  It's just like, can you let the guy go?  No.  Never.  No.  They can't.  Speakers that speak his voice as you're walking through, like, ghostly advice?  What does he fucking say?  No, no.  This is a true story.  All right.  So we're at the altar, at the little chapel, me and Angie, and I'm sweating because I've  already had one really ruinous, failed, horrible, shitty-ass marriage. 
[00:19:30]  So why would you do it again?  Well, because she's great, okay?  And not only that, we're at Graceland.  I got caught up in the moment, and I'm really glad I did.  But at any rate, I'm at the altar, so I go, look, I got to take a piss.  I got to take a piss.  So I left Angie at the altar, went to go take a piss, and in the actual bathroom next to  the altar, there's an escape door.  Get out of here.  For guys, I swear to God, there's an escape door in case you just want to, like, bolt 
[00:20:00]  at the last second.  Does that rock say, well, run, man.  Just run.  No, no, but so I'm in there looking at the door.  I'm throwing water on my face because I'm kind of like, man, do I really want to do this?  I don't know.  And I'm looking at the escape door in the back, which is open, which actually, you can  haul ass and run, right?  And I'm throwing water on my face.  All of a sudden, I hear through the speakers, sorry, man, it's all going to be okay.  And they do that shit on purpose.  I swear.  I talked to...  Wow.  Pastor, what was his name?  Pastor Bear. 
[00:20:30]  Pastor Bear was the guy who looked exactly like Jerry Falwell.  It was creepy, man.  It was like...  Yeah, it was creepy.  Jerry Falwell married us, basically.  And, yeah, they got Elvis piped through everything.  Everything, man.  It's creepy.  It's sad, man.  Did you plan on getting married there or did you just get there and go, hey, let's get  married?  Last minute thing, yeah.  That's one of those places that people like Vegas and...  Yeah, yeah.  ...are there.  People just decide.  Britney, you know, it's the same kind of deal.  His house is, like, hooked up from, like...  It was like his house was this shit in, like, 1972. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  See, he has, like...  I was just like to watch all the football games.  And he has, like, three TVs that are, like, the kind you have, like, in your kitchen on  the counter that you don't even fucking have cable hooked up to.  The Zenith.  We were talking about it yesterday.  Zenith TV's to watch the football.  Trinitron.  Yeah.  That's a hell of a way to get married there, Al.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, they left everything like it was at the time.  You know, hey, that's great.  You are really going to polish off that bottle.  How many bottles do you say you go through a day? 
[00:21:30]  How about 17.  17?  Yeah.  Get out of here.  Well, in between three and 17.  How many?  How many?  Hold me up.  One.  She's saying one.  So the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  Angie's blowing up your spot over there.  Oh, oh, oh, you're asking me what she allows me to drink before the rolling pin comes  out over the head.  That's one.  She don't look like a rolling pin type.  It's only 10.30.  He's already done with his first one.  It's a hell of a piece.  Hey, we got Mark from Iowa.  Go ahead, Mark.  I was going to say, Al should change his name to Al Amoni. 
[00:22:00]  Hey, thanks a lot, Al.  Very good.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Go ahead, spread that idea around.  Nice job.  Some guy called Radio Guy.  Radio Guy.  Hey, hey.  I just wanted to ask Al about, you know, back in the day, he's just like the Pet Shop Boys.  So I was wondering what he thinks about, you know, what the music they did back then.  Do they still get fans coming, like asking for that kind of crap?  Hell no, man.  I killed the Pets. 
[00:22:30]  What?  But the earlier music was more what?  The earlier music was complete crap.  The record label had me basically like Milli Vanilli.  Ouch.  Without the dreads.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  No, I mean, seriously.  I had stuff written for that record that wound up two records later because the label I was  on was like they appointed a producer.  They wrote the songs.  They wrote the choruses.  They appointed everyone for me, and I just sat around like, when do I lip sync?  And what year was this about? 
[00:23:00]  83.  83, and it was that type of like Pet Shop Boys sound?  Oh, it's disgusting, yeah.  Wow.  I've longed to sound like that.  Any songs we would know from that?  I hope not.  Well, look it up.  You got any?  Fuck you, man.  That's it.  I'm two bottles now.  I hope he just leaped right on it.  Let's look it up, man.  Look it up.  Look it up.  Wait, wait.  I just went through hell this morning on ESPN, all right?  I'm a Blackhawks fan, lifer, and the first thing they show when I'm on there is the 1971 
[00:23:30]  shot of Henri Richard in Game 7 against the Canadians in 71, beating Tony Esposito.  I was curled up in fetal position, started sucking my thumb and crying, whimpering like  a baby on ESPN.  Now you guys are going to fuck with me hard on this, too?  You guys suck.  We have fucked.  The thing is, though, we've brought out our first ever broadcast on the radio, mine and  Opie's, and it's horrific.  It's impossible to listen to.  Jimmy Norton brought his first tape of doing comedy. 
[00:24:00]  Horrific.  It's one of those things.  It's a cringe moment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  2004.  I'm 2002.  You just have to sit through.  But I'm only allowed one cringe a day.  Is that it?  All right.  I already had my cringe moment.  Well, 2005.  Keep going.  Nathaniel.  Nathaniel will never find it.  You'll probably get lucky and it won't be on the left.  I will kick your ass.  Stop!  Seriously.  I'm going through that bulletproof glass fucking window and I'm totally tearing you, man.  We got Joe Rogan.  We're not scared.  Let's fuck you.  All right.  He will kill you.  How's that for a Fear Factor episode?  Will you jump through that window and kill that man?  This looks like a murder. 
[00:24:30]  There's a girl with an electric eel in a tank surrounding her head.  They're mores.  Oh, more?  I remember this episode.  Mores are nasty too, though, right?  Yeah, they're dangerous.  They'll bite your face off.  They bit the shit out of one of the guys that was handling it.  In our massive computer, we don't have the 1983 stuff.  Hey, dude, get some brown recluses on your show.  Look what they did to me.  Check that out.  What the fuck is that?  What are those?  I got bit by a brown recluse.  They wanted to take my arm off.  What is a brown recluse?  It's a fucking asshole brown hairy spider, man.  Yeah, in Austin, Texas. 
[00:25:00]  Is that what those divots are?  It looks like someone took an all.  No, no.  Did you see this right here?  Where was that?  In Austin.  Texas, yeah?  Yeah.  Got them folks there?  The thing swelled up like Popeye's arm, right?  And I'm like, no, I'll just do some Benadryl.  I hate fucking doctors.  So I'm like eating Benadryl.  I'm just like, ain't going to go.  But they're finally like, dude, now your finger is, this middle finger is the size of like  a fucking kielbasa, right?  So they're like, you got to go to the hospital.  So I go to the hospital.  I'm thinking they're going to give me some antibiotics or something.  I go in there.  The first thing they say is, well, we have to take that arm off now. 
[00:25:30]  Holy shit.  And I'm like, whoa, wait a minute.  I don't play fucking drums for Def Leppard.  Okay.  I'm a guitar player.  And I think there's only one one-armed guitar player.  And that's the guy the Pope keeps hostage in the Vatican that plays classical guitar with  his feet.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that guy?  That guy rules.  He's not allowed to leave either.  They have him hostage.  You know, we got to free the one-armed fucking guitar player from the Vatican.  So I was like, tell him that. 
[00:26:00]  So they made me sign something saying like, well, if I die from the poison, I can't sue  them and all this shit.  I'm like, whatever, dude.  I'm not playing.  What did they have to do to your arm?  They had to cut it open from the middle finger all the way up.  Holy shit.  From the middle finger across the palm of your hand.  Well, I drove to the hospital with a kielbasa like this.  Through the wrist up to your elbow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Ay-ya.  Yeah.  So they wanted to just chop it off right away.  Oh, yeah.  They were like, you're gone, dude.  You're going to die. 
[00:26:30]  And I'm like, no, no, no.  So what did they do?  From a spider.  What did they do after they opened it up?  They drained the poison and shit.  It's like, what fucking year is this?  But here's how creepy the whole medical system is.  This is like, right as they're putting me under, right, with, you know, the wonderful  guest.  Yeah.  I love that show.  It's pretty cool.  But anyways, right as they're putting me under, here comes another fucking legal beagle  with like a piece of paper and a pen.  As I'm starting to nod off, they're going, and you also can't sue us if they fuck up your 
[00:27:00]  tattoos.  Oh.  I mean, they're all worried about everything, man.  I'm like, look, just keep my fucking arm.  I don't care about the tattoos, dude.  I'm not playing drums for Def Leppard, okay?  Did you say to him after all is said and done, do you call up that doctor and go, you are  going to cut my fucking arm off and it's fine now?  Yeah.  Is the guy like lazy?  Yeah.  It's like you bring a piece of shit, Karen.  That's a total, man.  We'll get you into something else.  Yeah.  Hey, they cut my toe off in Texas.  They're butchers there.  What did they do to your toe? 
[00:27:30]  I got infected.  Oh, Angie doesn't want us to see your toe.  No, it's a spider.  What?  No, I'm showing my toe.  Yeah, right on.  Last time I was here, I thumped my, whatever, on a microphone and kind of freaked Bodhi out,  but this toe is actually cooler, see?  Holy shit!  Holy shit!  I thought you...  They cut it off.  I thought you meant one of the little ones.  They cut it off.  Holy crap.  No, no, no.  The big toe is gone.  It took out the big one.  The big toe is completely gone.  Oh, you want this?  You want a close-up?  Should I whack it while you're like... 
[00:28:00]  Say it.  No.  What?  You sold?  I sold my toe for rock and roll.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Completely gone.  Joe Rogan, are you freaked out?  Nah, Joe's seen...  After I saw that guy get fucked by the horse, I'm okay.  Joe has seen too much.  In a weird way, it makes it more aerodynamic.  Yeah, wouldn't the foot be better without the big toe?  No, no, no.  It's more efficient.  It's kind of freaky because, like, I was shoplifting sunglasses right after I got out of jail at this Sitco.  You know, I was at a Sitco.  He's the big singer of the ministry. 
[00:28:30]  Jesus, Al.  It's going to be a hole in your socks.  It's for sport.  You ever go to the beach?  Yeah, well, you know...  How do you handle that flip-flop thing?  Wait a second, man.  Wait a second.  He's got to tape it on.  I know, I know.  Flip-flop thing is out of the question, dude.  Forget it.  Do you tape it?  All right, listen.  Do I tape it?  Wait, I want to...  No, I staple it.  Do you have some duct tape?  I staple it.  I want to hear the...  Dude, I got a roadie that actually has webbed feet to make up for my missing toe. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, my gosh.  I want to hear the shoplifting story.  All right, so I'm in there shoplifting sunglasses, and this black chick comes in on crutches.  What's the theme today?  Just freaking out, man, like really struggling.  I go, you know, I'm trying to make conversation because I see that the fucking guy's staring  at me by the sunglasses, so I know I'm going to get busted.  So I'm like trying to play nicey, right?  So I'm talking to her, and she's like, I just had my toe amputated.  I'm like, so did I.  When?  And she's like, three months before I did.  And I go, you're on crutches? 
[00:29:30]  She's like, yeah, the doctor told me I'd be on crutches for six months.  I was out there.  I walked out the next day.  And so I went back.  I called my doctor that took my toe off.  Oh, first of all, I wouldn't give it back.  I wanted to wear it as an earring or some shit.  I was like, the fuckers took it and sent it to CDC for some reason or whatever to see  if it was toxic or glowing or toxic toe.  So I called my doctor, and he's like, well, I've never quite seen this where we take a big toe off  and somebody walks right out of the hospital. 
[00:30:00]  And he goes, the only thing I could probably fathom is that you've just been so high and drunk all your life,  you're used to walking out of equilibrium, right?  So apparently, now I'm like normal without the toe.  It balanced things out.  It balanced things out.  You never said, how did you lose it?  Oh, I stepped on some fucking splinter that I left in there for like, god damn, I don't know.  Are you shitting me?  I thought it was another spider or something.  No, no.  The spider's got it in for me, dude.  I'm fucked. 
[00:30:30]  And didn't want to go to the doctor or something to get it out?  I hate doctors, dude.  Every time I go, they take a part off me.  Well, you know, he does have a point.  I think he's missing the connection.  There's a lesson to be learned.  All right, all right.  All right, I got it, guys.  It must have turned black or something, right?  Yeah, it turned black.  Did you at least take pictures of it before they hacked it off?  No, dude, I thought it was fine.  I thought, eat a couple Benadryl, it'll go away. 
[00:31:00]  That Benadryl.  Where'd you get the idea that was a cure-all?  I know, man.  That Benadryl stock is just dropping.  Al Jorgensen of Ministry.  You're all right, man.  That's great, man.  We got the picture of your missing big toe up online already.  Wow, that was fast.  That was really fast.  Damn, is that fast?  And this is already like, that's a real fucking rock star right there.  Sold my toe for rock and roll.  Wow.  It looks like your other toe is making up for your big toe. 
[00:31:30]  It's getting bigger or something.  Getting wider.  No, it's pissed.  It's pissed.  It's got to take over the top.  It's going to do all this extra work.  Twice the work.  Exactly.  Twice the work, half the pay.  A bunch of little kids like the dad left.  They're all fucking angry.  You're the man now.  That first toe had to become the man of the family before he even wanted to.  I didn't have a childhood.  It was the dad raising the other toes when he was 16.  Look, man.  I didn't want it, but this little piggy is now the breadwinner. 
[00:32:00]  Let's go to Elmer.  Elmer, what's up?  Elmer.  Hey, what's up, man?  I want you to ask Al about the time he blew up his tour bus.  Al, you blowed up your tour bus?  Well, yeah.  I got shrapnel in my eardrum.  I took a couple of Benadryl.  No, no.  I was fine.  It was actually probably the fucking coolest thing with my eyes that I've ever seen.  I mean, probably the birth of my daughter with a close second I'm blowing up the tour bus. 
[00:32:30]  And now what happened?  Okay.  So, first, I have to preface this by saying when I was in Nashville, Tennessee on the Lollapalooza tour in 90...  Oh, back in 93, kids.  Anyways, look.  So, this toothless, like, old man at this, like, truck stop where we go in and shoplift sunglasses.  Like, I mean, it's like, hey, you guys want to buy some fireworks?  I'm like, yeah, yeah, cool. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, shit.  Don't take long to put two and two together here.  So, I went behind the Petra.  It was a Petra truck stop.  And I bought this, what looked like a fucking bazooka.  I mean, it was like six feet long metal tube, all right?  And we like to have fun with fireworks.  Anyways, I mean, we wake each other up on the bunks with, like, M80s and shit in the bunk.  Like, wake up, fucker, boom!  You know?  So, we're kind of prone to that anyway. 
[00:33:30]  Lose a thumb.  But this was a fucking bazooka, dude.  But I was like, yeah, it was cheap.  It was like 50 bucks.  It's like, yeah, awesome.  Bring it, you know?  And I forgot about it.  I set it up on there.  And then Gibby Haynes from the Butthole Surfers was traveling with us for a while, too.  So, Gibby got into our M80 supply that we usually throw at each other and shit.  So, Gibby's like, hey, man, let's light these up on the bus.  I'm like, oh, that is so lame, man.  We do that every day.  What's wrong with you?  Here, oh, I remember.  I got this fucking six-foot pyro on here. 
[00:34:00]  So, we're in the back of the bus.  We light the fucking thing.  And this thing, the guy told me, I remember the Toothless guy told me,  it's supposed to make, like, a pirate ship in the air or some shit.  It's like, it's supposed to make this galleon with multicolored shit.  So, we light the thing in the bus while we're rolling down the highway between Houston and Dallas, right?  Where are you aiming at? 
[00:34:30]  We're in the very back lounge, because that's the only place I'm allowed to be.  I go right to the back of the bus, right?  They're like, so, we light it.  I'm laughing.  I'm thinking, all right, we're going to put it out, okay?  I'll light it and just freak everyone out a little bit.  The thing's a professional pyro.  It's got an underwater fuse.  You cannot put it out.  So, we're like, you have to cut it in front of it, right?  And no one has scissors, so everyone just scrambles out of the back room, man.  Just, whoa, dive into the bus.  And it's down to me, Gibby, and this guy named Greg Workman, who runs... 
[00:35:00]  Ipecac.  Ipecac Records, right.  And we're all passing the thing back and forth going,  you take it, you take it, you take it, you take it, you take it, you take it.  It's like a funny cartoon.  So, it was totally, yeah, it was, you know, Acme Explosive.  So, at that point, Gibby jumps down into the final open bunk,  shuts the curtain and hunkers down.  Me and Greg are still passing it back and forth.  I finally go, Greg, that's it, man, I'm out of here. 
[00:35:30]  And so, Greg, like, just gets down on one knee at the very back of the bus  and aims it for the front of the bus.  That's all you can do.  Booyah!  The thing goes off, and they had the front door closed up front  because the rest of the band had a bunch of straight-edge guys  playing bridge or some shit up there.  And they always, like, thought we were disgusting,  so they always put us in the back of the bus.  And even for them, this was pretty cool.  It's like, or not uncool, I should say.  It's just like, you know, what was that explosion?  Because this explosion comes up, starts hitting the door 
[00:36:00]  between the front and the back of the bus,  like this, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.  All these pellets.  Pellets bounce off the door and catch every bunk on fire.  All right?  And the great thing about this was  is every fire was a different color.  It was like Apocalypse Now on the fucking bridge scene, dude,  with Lance doing that.  So the whole bus is on this colored fire.  All of a sudden, the brakes slam on the bus driver.  He's like, that's it, I'm calling the police. 
[00:36:30]  You motherfuckers, my bus is on fire.  I'm calling the police right now.  So he makes us all get off the bus.  Take everything off.  You're kicked off.  You're kicked off.  So we had a keg of beer on tap in the back.  So we grabbed that, left our luggage on,  just grabbed the keg of beer,  went off and waited for the cops, right?  So the cops come up and see this bus  on the side of the road  with purple, orange, green smoke pouring,  pouring out of the thing, man.  I mean, you're just so psychedelic, right? 
[00:37:00]  A crow's nest on top and sparklers.  These guys were right out of fucking Dukes of Hazzard,  these state troopers that came up like, boy.  And the bus driver's jumping up and down,  literally having a tantrum, like jumping, like,  I want these boys in jail.  They ruined my bus.  They ruined my bus and all shit.  And the fucking cop looks at him and just goes,  boy, get these boys back on the bus.  What'd you expect?  These are rockers.  This ain't Mozart.  Which is awesome,  because we're sitting here pouring, like, 
[00:37:30]  drinks off a keg of beer on the side of the road,  laughing our ass off,  while the bus driver has no solution to this, man.  You've got to know that's bad.  If it's going to make a galleon,  it's not like a sparkler  or fucking like an aerial bomb or something.  If something's going to make a galleon,  there's a lot of shit in there  that's going to burn.  Well, dude, it sent,  the recoil sent Greg, like,  three feet in the air.  What a great fucking story.  That's the greatest tour bus story ever. 
[00:38:00]  Ever.  Absolutely.  It wasn't that great.  It cost us, what,  63,000 bucks?  In hindsight,  it's got to be worth it.  No, no.  At least 63,000 dollars.  Yeah, I know.  The ship line is the best.  The colored smoke was the best, dude.  That was so apocalypse now.  God, I wish you had video of that.  That would have been insane.  Kind of a little bit hectic  to get a little bit of video camera going, man.  You take it, you take it,  you take it, you take it.  Great shit, man.  By the way,  people are checking out  your missing toe picture like crazy. 
[00:38:30]  Cool.  On opiananthony.com.  That's Al Jorgensen of Ministry.  Let's say hi to Scott  in good old Tennessee.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, Al,  I was just wondering  when the next album's coming out, man.  Yeah, we should do some business here, right?  When you said Tennessee,  I thought he was going to go,  hey, I was the one that sold you that.  All the tunes is good.  When's the next album coming out?  Well, I mean,  I got one out today or something.  They want me to shill,  but they being the label.  What's out today? 
[00:39:00]  Rantology.  And what's that about?  I don't know.  You keep asking me  all them hard questions, man.  I don't know what...  Is it what?  Is it remixes or something?  It's a bunch of shit on there.  You're not happy with it?  No, it's all great.  I thought this guy rocks.  Al rocks.  Derek, you got a little something  to play for Al Jorgensen?  You fucking...  I will attack. 
[00:39:30]  Go ahead, play it.  Oh, you suck.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  Make it stop.  Make it stop.  From 1983.  Shut the fuck up.  You suck.  Seriously, after I'm done here,  you are soaking your ass.  You're going to kill you, Derek.  What were you wearing  when you were singing this?  What was I wearing?  Did you have like a vest  with like no shirt?  Yeah, that and a G-string.  We all have our crosses 
[00:40:00]  to bear from the past, my friend.  All right, hey,  make this equal opportunity.  Play his first shit.  Yeah, it's really bad.  All right.  It's really bad.  There you go, fuckhead.  Nice job.  I'm so happy with you right now.  I can't believe Derek  was brave enough to do that.  No, that's pretty cool.  He's got some balls.  I may spare his life  and beat him to an inch of it.  How's that?  We'll spare him, though.  We'll spare him.  Wow, that's terrific.  No, it's not. 
[00:40:30]  It's 1983.  I ain't coming.  Everybody hates their own shit.  I could do that everywhere.  We thought we were all getting along.  What the hell?  No, it's all peaceful.  And we got your bottle of wine.  We had to, you know,  make fun of you.  Well, it's gone.  It was a bottle of wine.  I was going to ask you  for a little bit.  Now it's a projectile.  The listener requests voicemail.  Next message.  My name is Larry.  I'm from Maryland.  And this show here  goes back to the old accent. 
[00:41:00]  Before the nice studio  when they had their own  little small sit-up.  They decided they needed somebody  to bring them in some furniture  for an office.  You know, they had a place  for somebody to sit.  So what happens?  Some woman brings in  this old ready couch,  poker chips,  and a few other crap.  And, well,  nobody knows what anybody  should do when they  disrespect the show  and bring some shit like that.  So sit back  and enjoy this  because it's just horrific.  Message deleted. 
[00:41:30]  We got Erica in the studio.  Hello.  It's Couch Lady.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  So what's the deal?  You were supposed to be here  last week with the couch?  Yes, and unfortunately,  I had a little  incident?  Infection?  No.  In what?  I don't know.  I guess I had anxiety  last week.  Oh, you had an anxiety attack?  I had an anxiety attack.  Is that why our porn stars  had to have lesbian sex  on a piece of fiberglass?  Is that what it was?  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  So I was going to wake up  really early in the morning  and talk.  Wait, are you the same girl  that was just sitting out there?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just wondering.  Because there's other girls  that have been walking through.  I guess he was a little confused.  There's another girl  sitting next to me  that's blonde.  Oh, okay.  I told you there's a bunch  of people out there now.  Oh.  I get you.  So, yeah.  What's your name?  Erica.  Erica.  So you own a furniture store?  Well, we had an antique  consignment shop  from furnishings  and we had a bunch of stuff  that we had.  But you were the same girl 
[00:42:30]  sitting right there.  Yeah.  Yeah, I told you.  Huh.  Are you married?  No.  Oh, nice.  I don't know.  Getting married.  Oh, not nice.  Could you tell us more  about the furniture store?  It's closed.  I thought it would make  a good addition  to the book guy  we just listened to.  No, it's...  Why did it close down?  Economy's not good.  No.  And you oversleep a lot?  Pretty much going down  a crapper, so...  Yeah.  And I what?  And you oversleep a lot.  I heard you had a problem  last week.  He gave me something  for anxiety.  Hey, come get back on mic. 
[00:43:00]  Knocked me a cold  and I just did not wake up.  Really?  Wait, who gave you  this medicine?  My doctor.  Right.  And so you had some anxiety  and he gave you something?  Yeah.  To make you sleep?  Yeah, he goes,  here, take one of these.  I'm like,  what were you anxious about?  I don't...  I, well,  things and...  Yeah?  Just things.  Whatever, and I took one  and knocked me a cold  for like 12 hours straight  and I...  Same girl, huh?  It worked.  You weren't anxious  for 12 hours.  Yeah, exactly.  There's something  about this glass.  Kind of works,  is what I'm thinking.  Oh, the couch is coming.  Oh, here comes  the lesbian couch  that Erica brought in. 
[00:43:30]  We're having a ceremony?  Do we have any,  you know,  music that we could play?  We should have thought  ahead of time.  Lesbian couch music, Hopi?  A little Katie Lang?  What, do you want a polka?  I think there's like  a heart filter  on that glass or something.  I'm gonna...  A what?  Like, you know,  in the heart videos.  All right, where's the couch?  Very nice.  Jim's on the lesbian couch.  You bet I am.  You want to explain  what the lesbian couch is  for the people at home?  You're the expert on couches. 
[00:44:00]  It's just a love seat,  probably from the 80s.  Yes, it is a love seat.  From the late 80s.  Late 80s?  Probably late 80s.  Only the best  for your pals,  Opie and Anthony.  Early, I don't know  exactly what year.  Any stains on it?  No, it's clean.  Where was it all this time?  Yeah, where was it  for 20 years?  Come on, tell the truth.  If it doesn't sell  in the store  after so long,  we take ownership of it  and it's out  in the warehouse  for a little while.  It goes to the warehouse  for half place.  If it doesn't sell...  We got the blacklight. 
[00:44:30]  We're gonna make sure  this is a...  Well, you need  an extension cord, guys.  I don't think it's gonna reach...  Sorry, not as good  as through the mirror, Opie.  Is that what you're  trying to say?  No, I didn't say that, really.  You can say it.  I don't know.  You just looked different  when you were sitting  out there, that's all.  What are you saying?  She's lovely.  I know she's lovely.  Stop trying to cause trouble.  Norton's causing trouble.  I'm not at all.  I'm trying to sit on the couch  and look at her hiney.  You have a nice hiney.  Oh.  She goes, oh.  Do you have an extension cord?  Blacklight? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, we're gonna check  out with the blacklight.  All right, we're  plugging in the blacklight.  We wanna see if anybody's  been having any hanky-panky.  No idea who owned it prior  to...  I have no idea.  Oh, yeah, no idea.  Homicide committed  on this couch.  I could only dream.  Turn off the lights.  Ooh.  This will definitely  make this more gooder.  Oh, God.  She's light out.  We have to get some curtains,  by the way,  for them stupid...  We don't have the blacklight.  Man, it's curtains for you.  I asked you guys  what you wanted.  I could have brought curtains.  No, that's...  The couch is fine.  Yeah, the couch is fine.  A post-1981 couch? 
[00:45:30]  I have no idea  what year it's from.  It does look kind of 80.  All right, let's turn  on the blacklight.  Here we go.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's kind of...  You're not gonna...  It's fine.  It'll serve the purpose  for a bunch of dykes.  Don't blacklight the girl.  Blacklight the couch.  Oh, boy.  Can you turn it on?  What are you doing?  Why doesn't anything  work on this show, ever?  Danny.  Danny!  Danny!  Danny!  Danny, get that  blacklight working.  That's the important thing.  All right, now we're  trying to figure out  how to turn on 
[00:46:00]  the blacklight.  Come over here.  I'll fill out your card.  Wow, this show  is just going downhill  in a hurry.  No!  We can't figure out  the blacklight.  It's fine.  Danny, what's wrong  with the blacklight?  I don't know.  It's not turning on.  Danny!  Danny!  Sorry.  Calm down.  Danny!  It'll be okay.  I tested it before  I brought it in  to make sure that it worked  before I brought it here.  For some reason...  The extension cord's bad.  It's been laying in the booth.  Plug it directly into the wall  and see if it works.  Attaboy it.  The socket is bad.  There you go.  There's plenty of things that...  All right, we got the blacklight on.  It's the extension cord.  It's the extension cord.  Everyone calm down. 
[00:46:30]  All right, pull the couch over  and give it a once-over.  How do you know  if there's a load on there?  What do you see?  You'll see white.  Oh, my God.  Is that X-Files music?  Very good.  All right, we're checking  the lesbian couch  for splooge marks.  So far, so good, right?  Anything?  We're getting a thumbs up.  Oh, they're pointing out  something, Steve?  Eric?  Jim?  Yeah.  And on the armrest  would be where you would  bend a girl over and bang her.  All right, Steve, absolutely.  What are you seeing?  Big white stain  right on the armrest.  I'm not lying.  Take a look.  Uh-oh.  What does it look like, Mulder? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You would absolutely use  that part of the couch, too.  You would bend her over that.  That's a definite load  right there.  A dried-up load.  That light detects semen.  Oh, there's another one.  There's something going on  over there  where your upper back  would rest on the back  of the couch there, Anthony.  All right.  What is that?  Is that urine?  Oh, that's just the design.  No, what is that?  Is that the pattern  of the couch?  It is now. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  That's what...  I don't know, man.  Is that the pattern  of the couch  or is this just splattered?  Splooge stain.  Oh, what about that stain?  That's the pattern.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  I see the pattern.  The pattern is called  jizz stain.  It was very popular  in the early 80s.  Oh, there's another one.  Is that a big stain  right there?  What do you think?  Wait a minute.  Maybe that's just  the pattern, too.  I think we have  a relatively clean  lesbian couch, Anthony.  I think so, too.  There's one or two  spots on it, but... 
[00:48:00]  Well, I don't know.  Let's go back to the stain  on the right armrest.  There's leaves in it?  There's leaves  in the couch, Anthony.  Yes.  I aired it out yesterday.  What?  What?  I aired it out yesterday  and the leaves...  Outside and leaves fell?  Yes.  All right.  She aired it out.  Thanks.  Wow.  Look at that.  A condom.  No.  All right.  I think we're  pretty clean, huh?  Clean.  Look a thousand  young couches.  Let's go back  to this stain over here.  I think this might be  just part of the patent.  No, that's a stain.  Okay. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, that's a stain.  We definitely have  one stain in it.  All right.  Well, hopefully tomorrow  we'll get a bunch more  stains on that thing.  Okay.  Sorry, Jimmy.  You won't be here.  That was nice.  I like that.  The lights were out.  The X-Files music playing.  The weird black light on  like they're investigating  something.  Very nice.  That was good.  Well, guys,  the show became  more gooder today.  We now have  our lesbian couch back.  Yeah.  I'm glad there's  no lesbians here  to use it.  I know.  Tomorrow.  Yeah, tomorrow  we're going to do it.  Maybe they can't make it tomorrow.  The Dykes will come out  tomorrow. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Well, I hope you appreciate it  and use it often.  So when are you getting married?  I was supposed to get married  this month.  But what happened?  Uh-oh.  Why?  Why?  Uh-oh.  Because of the store closing  and other stuff,  so we decided to push it off  to the summer.  What was the other stuff?  Did he bring it up to you?  Oh, no.  It had nothing to do with Ben.  No?  He didn't bring it up to you  and say,  perhaps,  you know,  the store closing,  we should push this off?  Yeah, guys tend to 
[00:49:30]  really want to postpone  those things.  No.  It's one of those  take it or leave it,  married or not married things?  Well, whatever.  It will happen.  Isn't it kind of  an important thing, though?  It is.  You should be kind of  excited about that, no?  You know, yeah, you are,  but you can't dwell on it  if it happens.  You know, you've got to  post a call.  If it happens, it happens.  If it happens, you know.  This is a story here.  Yeah.  What's the story?  Come on.  How long have you dated Ben?  I have been dating Ben  for a little over three years.  Okay.  His mom owns the store.  You know.  Uh-oh.  The mom doesn't like you. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, no.  No?  She's in New York.  Oh.  Um, she's cool.  It's just that the economy  went down the shitter,  and, you know,  people don't want  to buy stuff that's...  Listen to Bush.  It didn't.  It's got leaves on it.  Yeah.  Yeah, they want to buy  new stuff and not pay  two years in no interest,  you know, so they don't  want to go spend money.  Oh, it was used furniture.  Because it's a consignment  shop.  Exactly.  It's all used stuff.  Oh, okay.  People kind of want  new furniture.  Yeah, they want their  furniture without splooch.  They want to go to the big 
[00:50:30]  They want to shop at Siemens,  not have furniture with  Siemens on it.  Exactly.  Right.  I got it.  They want clean stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you have sales on Tuesday?  Starting at noon.  We're selling the best used  furniture with the biggest  splooge stains.  This Tuesday night,  come in for our  splooge stain spectacular  at splooge stains.  No, of course it's not  named splooge stains.  Your store wasn't named  splooge stains, was it? 
[00:51:00]  No.  And I'm not going to say  the name of the store.  Okay.  So now, things with Ben,  you kind of, you want to  get married, but...  Oh, yeah, we're totally  going to get married.  We're now changing the  entire concept of the  wedding.  We were going to do that  typical, you know, big  reception, and everyone  sits down for dinner, and  the photographer, and the  limo, you know, that  whole...  You tame it down?  The whole wedding.  Now it's going to be...  Just get a tent in the  backyard.  That's what we're doing.  We're going...  Money was an issue, I'm  not going to lie.  Okay.  Money was a total issue.  So...  Well, it sounds like it. 
[00:51:30]  Just a tent with a bunch  of load-stained couches?  Instead of spending 30  grand, we're going to cut  it back probably to 10.  Fine.  So...  Wow.  We'll just have a big,  fat party this summer,  and...  All right.  Sort of sounds like you're  going through a tough  time.  No, I mean, not  necessarily.  No?  I'm getting through it.  I'm fine.  Well, it sounds like the  anxiety, and the furniture  store closing, and the  marriage having to be  postponed, and scaled back...  I'm a mess.  Fine.  Yeah, it does sound  like, you know, it's a  little bit of stress in  your life. 
[00:52:00]  And I'm glad you could  take time out from your  stressful life and bring  us a lesbian couch.  So I had all the time  in the world.  There are other ways to  earn money.  Jimmy will show you.  That's the hotel I stayed  at last night next door.  Oh, did you stay in the  city?  I stayed next door at...  How do you get the  couch here?  In your car?  In a minivan.  In a minivan.  Which hotel did you stay  at?  The one to the...  Is it the one Opie used  to stay at?  Similar.  Oh, yeah?  What's it called?  I don't know.  You tell us.  The one right here to  the right of the building.  Oh, yeah.  Think of it. 
[00:52:30]  I didn't even know  there was a hotel there.  The Salisbury Hotel.  Isn't that a homeless  hotel?  I walked in going...  I think that's a flop  house.  It's like a flop house  or something.  I thought it was classy.  No.  So not.  The Park of Meridian  is right across the street.  And that's a wonderful  hotel.  I love it.  Why didn't you stay at  the old Park of Meridian?  I didn't even know it was  there.  Because business is bad.  That's true.  No, not necessarily.  Couldn't afford it, Jim.  Okay?  Thanks for rubbing it in.  I wouldn't stay there.  For four hours?  I mean, I got to bed  at midnight.  She can't afford her wedding 
[00:53:00]  and you spend $30,000  a year on hookers.  Why did you get up  in the morning?  Why did you...  I didn't know what time  necessarily you guys  could take it in.  So I just decided to...  We were trying to sleep  after the anxiety medication  and thinking about  the business going down  and sleeping in the hotel  with the red neon light  blinking through the window.  Actually, no.  I fell right to sleep  and then I got up  and showered  and came over here.  Really?  See you guys.  Wasn't that big a deal?  No.  I'm sorry.  I got nothing. 
[00:53:30]  I'm a mess.  Trying to sleep  and this is outside.  Why?  Why?  I just want to drop  the couch off.  I don't know.  I'm glad I brought it  to you guys.  Are you kidding me?  No, we're happy.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, no.  I'm glad.  That's better than  the last one we had.  It was a little road trip  for me to take, you know?  Yeah, no.  Awesome.  We'll give you some prizes.  Yeah.  I actually have prizes  for you guys.  What do you have?  What do you have?  I brought some other stuff  for you.  What?  What gifts?  Do you like me to get it?  Sure would.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  No, not donkey sausage  kind of thing.  No, no, no.  No, follow out the door  and get the other stuff.  What kind of gifts?  I don't know.  It's just little stuff.  All right, yeah.  Go get the gifts.  Yeah.  I'd like a gift.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  Opi, it's on outside.  Oh.  No, I want an audio-thon.  She's coming back in  with her gifts.  All right.  Bring her in.  Bring her in.  Bring the lady in  with the gifts.  Jesus.  Bring in the present lady.  I'll hear the replay.  Talk anything about me. 
[00:54:30]  I really don't care.  That's what sucks  about this show.  Don't.  Stupid replay.  Stupid replay.  Don't offend me.  No.  All right.  We like you, actually.  Yeah.  What kind of gifts?  What do we got?  It's a magazine.  A sink magazine that we're in.  A sink.  A gift.  That we have.  Huh?  You want to sign it.  The sink.  You want us to sign stuff?  That's a gift.  And what's with the pink hat?  Pink hat?  Is that a gift?  Is that yours?  Steve, we got a gift.  No, like I said, the store's closed, and I listen all the time. 
[00:55:00]  So, you know, I heard a couple different things, and I went to the store and grabbed some stuff  just for...  All righty.  Let's grab you guys.  All right.  Let's see what she's got for everybody.  What do I have?  Well, considering Opie has nothing to entertain with, I grabbed something.  Uh-oh.  Oh, it's not bad.  What is it?  Is it one of those things that's used for jacking off, like in 10 to midnight?  No, it's just a simple little dish that he can just throw on the table.  Oh, and like chips can go in there?  Oh, wow.  This is like a housewarming. 
[00:55:30]  Hey, you haven't got a housewarming gift there, have you?  So, you gave Opie something that is graceable.  It's gay.  I really, you know, it's just grass and stuff.  We all get our gifts.  Why would you give Opie something that he could perhaps accidentally drop?  You could have washed it before he gave it to me.  Jesus, this leftover dip in the dip part.  Check the price tag on the back.  She spent $13.50 on me.  Thank you.  And then I got two beer pitchers for you guys in case...  Oh, we might need pitchers. 
[00:56:00]  That's true.  Hey, I just grabbed some stuff.  Don't wait.  I don't understand.  Don't be defensive.  You're bringing us gifts and we appreciate them.  I want to smash this.  No.  He is the worst.  What?  I didn't say anything.  You are the worst.  Wow, now that's a nice pitcher.  It is a nice pitcher.  Is it glass?  No, it's that hard plastic, right?  It's plastic.  Those are good to drink a beer out of if you're starring in Young Frankenstein.  All right, what's that?  What do you got over there?  Looks like a Claymore mine. 
[00:56:30]  What is that?  Oh, I think it's...  Poker chips?  Poker chips?  From the 1940s.  It's poker chips that Al Capone used.  She obviously stopped at a garage sale on the way down to New York.  Looks like poker chips in a hat box.  Oh, they're in a hat box.  Wow.  Wow.  I got some...  You got any cards with those chips?  Yes.  Oh, let's have a little hand just for fun.  I could sit here now and shuffle chips with one hand. 
[00:57:00]  Wow.  Like they do on the World Series of Poker.  That's just wonderful.  This is good.  I'll bet there's a gift for Jim Norton in there.  Uh, this probably sat on top of a 60s style folding poker table for years.  I hate my gift.  What is that?  I...  I'm...  Dude, it's a joke because they were ranking on you.  You had nothing.  What is, uh...  What's that?  My gift stinks.  Oh, wow. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, they're playing cards from the Moshe Suck...  Moshe Suck Valley Railroad Company.  What the fuck is this?  Wow, I guess that...  I guess there must be some more gifts in there.  Now that's it.  No?  Wait, you got a beer pitcher for Jim?  I just grabbed them for all of you to use.  But what about Jim?  Jim, I don't...  It's for everybody.  But that's not fair.  No, these are for everybody.  It's not necessarily, I mean...  But I don't drink alcohol.  Exactly.  Could someone open the window?  I'll take it back. 
[00:58:00]  All right.  Name of the game is Texas Hold'em, boys.  Ooh, you got chips and everything.  Yeah.  That would be great if they weren't...  That pack wasn't missing aces.  Card with little...  Are there 52 in this?  I don't think there's 52 cards there.  I should have never brought these in as a stocky sausage.  At least the other pack of cards is still wrapped.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got one wrapped, one unwrapped.  What, did you gamble at the bus station on the way here?  Yes, I did.  And then this pack, because there's four decks of cards, both of these are still wrapped. 
[00:58:30]  Atta boy.  I'd love to know where these came from.  No idea.  Where'd you get them?  The store.  What store?  Her store.  Someone probably brought them in.  I can't imagine why the store is going under.  I just can't fathom...  With little tidbits like this?  Little trinkets and knick-knacks?  Yeah, you might need better stuff in your store.  Maybe that's what it is.  Wow.  You were selling this?  There's plenty of stuff in there that was very nice. 
[00:59:00]  I bet.  That's...  Only the best for your pals, huh?  You can throw it out the window.  Stop looking around.  I know him.  You break it.  I'd be happy if you broke it.  I'm just trying to figure out where I could break it.  No.  This place is so nice and new.  No.  No.  It's the state-of-the-art studio that we're in.  It's a bit.  Opie doesn't really break things.  That the gang from XM Satellite built for us, and...  Opie doesn't really break things.  It's a joke.  I never broke this thing in my life.  It's a bit.  Oh, the carts have little trains on them.  Yeah, little choo-choo. 
[00:59:30]  That's a good kind of thing.  Well, if you haven't broken anything yet, you might as well, because it could be the  first thing you break in the studio.  You broke your mouse, but that could be the second thing.  That's a good gift.  You could have people over.  Or you could put the dip in the one thing, and the chips in the surrounding dish.  Well, Martha Stewart, this is a very good suggestion.  All right.  Well, this is lovely.  Thank you.  I'm done.  There's your couch.  All right.  Thank you for the couch, and the gifts, and everything.  You're welcome. 
[01:00:00]  Why do you look so dejected?  Yeah.  I'm very happy.  I play cards, and now I have chips and choo-choo train cards.  Two packs of cards and a felt case.  Yeah, the case is felt with some gold leaf trim on the side.  That's right.  It's like an old velour shirt I had when I was eight.  Can I see those pictures?  Yeah.  I promise you're not going to break in front of me.  Don't break anything, Hopi.  No, I need the other one, too.  That's not bad.  Oh, I can't break this.  No, why would you?  It's glass.  It is glass, right?  It's glass.  They're both real glass? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, people will.  I was ready to shower to that.  No, I wasn't.  I'm kidding.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Enjoy.  We got the lesbian couch, which we will use tomorrow.  Hopi got a nice gift, and Anthony got a nice gift, and I don't drink, but I have beer  pictures that I can share.  You can put some soda pop in it.  You don't watch the New York Times, do you?  You can put some soda pop in it.  Maybe I can have a Coke.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, you're welcome, guys.  Okay.  Have a good one. 
[01:01:00]  Thank you.  We have to take our picture, don't we?  Well, I was going to.  Okay.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Steve.  No, don't.  Don't.  Don't.  You're going to go right through that window.  It's going to go through the control room window.  No, Opi.  Oh, my God.  No.  Opi, don't.  Don't do it.  She's still there.  Oh, my God.  No.  See, you put dip in that.  Put dip in it.  And then you put the chips in the around there.  It's not even washed out.  It's nice. 
[01:01:30]  And you can look at the remnants from the dip.  From the going away party.  Great party, isn't it?  Yeah.  Why is this place so nice?  There's nothing to break it on.  Nah, you know, don't drop it on the floor.  Opi.  Opi.  Opi.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You threw it.  Oh, my God.  It's broken.  Now you just separated. 
[01:02:00]  You can put the dip in that dish.  All right.  I'm not even looking out the window.  I can't even look at her face now.  Why?  Because she gave you something and you broke it.  I didn't think it would break.  It's ceramic.  It's rare when you throw ceramic on a hard floor that it breaks.  I could see where you'd be confused.  Oh, my God.  You are the worst human.  I can't even look at her face.  No.  Why?  Oh, God.  Not even smiling at all. 
[01:02:30]  I can't believe you.  I cannot believe you.  You can fix that.  A little glue.  Opi, look out the window.  I can't.  Look out the window.  She's going to cry.  I'm sorry.  Is she smiling?  You can put this right back together.  This is not even that much damage.  All right.  Oof.  All right.  Well.  Let's get out of this uncomfortable situation, please. 
[01:03:00]  She's really hurt.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Norton was just lying on the lesbian couch.  It stinks, huh?  It's fine.  It smells moldy.  I'm just tired.  I don't care.  All right.  Well, I like the lesbian couch.  Thumbs up to the lesbian couch.  It'll smell like...  It has only one splooge stain, so that's good.  That'll change up.  You're trying to give her a thumbs up through the window.  Did you notice that?  How revolting was that?  Thumbs up.  And she did...  I'm with you. 
[01:03:30]  She's just staring into space.  She's not even looking at you.  No.  I'm not trying to make up for smashing her gift.  I just kind of tossed it to the side, and then it's shattered.  I don't know.  It's ceramic, and you broke it on purpose, and you giggled.  You're an awful person.  All right, well...  Your aunt's doing nothing but trashing those awful 1951 poker chips.  Yeah, see, that's the difference, though, man.  What?  Why don't you say what you were saying during the commercial break?  I hate your poker chips.  I said...  And wish you had balls like me.  That these days...  Those chips stink.  Nowadays, you can get chips that... 
[01:04:00]  The same chips you play with in Vegas.  You know who uses chips like that?  Third graders.  Yeah, these chips are...  They need a little weight.  They don't have any weight for them.  They need some weight.  These are the plastic chips you used to play with with your junior high buddies.  They're awful.  You'd steal them from your parents and play poker.  They are awful plastic chips.  Give her the chips back.  Yeah, you got it.  Why should I give them back?  Just tell her you don't want them.  You might have to, Ant.  Oh, Bray's a good point.  Tell her you don't want her stupid chips. 
[01:04:30]  Why do I have to be part of your rudeness?  Because you're like all brave when we're in commercial break.  But I can understand, you know, that something might suck and I might hate it, but I'm not going to...  And Norton, what about you?  These gifts stink.  They do stink.  I don't want to be known as the bad guy today.  I don't want to be known as the bad guy today.  A hat box full of chips.  A hat box.  The Lucille Ball hat box she bought when she was out with Viv.  She got that from a garage sale.  A little stupid hat in the box.  Yeah.  Now take it back, Lucy.  Now, Anthony, what's what it looks like?  Call her back in here. 
[01:05:00]  But I understand I can get a bad gift and still be nice and not hurt people's feelings.  Call her back in here and give her her gift back.  Why do I have to hurt someone's feelings?  I will not bow to peer pressure and hurt someone's feelings.  Call her out on her gift.  I will tell her her gift sucks, but I will keep it.  Oh, you will, huh?  Yeah.  Let's see Anthony say that.  You're really not coming back in here.  Are you insane?  Hi, Erica.  I just wanted to say, Opie had a little mishandling of your gift.  He bobbled it a little while he was trying to put it over by his stuff, and it broke. 
[01:05:30]  But I have the cards and chips, and thank you.  You guys, I know, I know.  Anthony, tell her.  Throw them out.  You hate them.  I don't care.  What?  Tell her.  Don't bother me.  What?  Are those good chips?  I'm not saying that they're bad chips.  Are they good chips?  They're old.  They're probably from the 70s.  I just grabbed them.  70s earth mama chips.  70s earth mama muff chips.  Throw them away.  It would have been cool if it came from Frank Sinatra's house, but obviously it didn't.  You know, they could be worth money. 
[01:06:00]  You don't know.  I don't know.  Well, if they were worth money, you'd be getting married.  What's wrong with that?  That's a genuine wood chip holder, isn't it?  Hey, give me those chips.  I guess that's right for my face, Steve.  Give her.  Give Opie the chips.  I'm just thinking.  I like them.  I really do.  But I'm thinking maybe somebody else could use them more than I could.  I'd be more than happy to take them and throw them in the trash for you, Anthony.  No, I'm not going to throw them in the trash, but perhaps somebody could use them more than I. 
[01:06:30]  I'll take them back, Anthony.  Just give them to me.  Tell her.  She's yelling.  Tell her.  I'm trying to be nice.  What do you mean?  Why am I being yelled at?  You play Texas Hold'em?  You play Texas Hold'em.  Why can't you use those?  Well, they're just not quite the type of equipment I like playing with.  What kind do you like playing with?  They're chips and cards.  Well, different cards and different chips.  People play with different types of things.  Yes, sir.  I'll pass it back to Steve.  Give her the chips.  Opie, give those to her.  It's heavy.  These are the cards that are still... 
[01:07:00]  There you go.  They're all wrapped up.  See?  They're still wrapped.  They're all wrapped up.  You ever play 52-card pick-up?  Oh, gee.  Opie.  There's no reason I keep the cards at her.  Did the cards hit you?  Did they?  Opie, she had cards falling off her sleeve.  Come on.  No.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, my God.  Opie. 
[01:07:30]  Holy shit.  Opie.  Don't video tape.  Oh, boy.  Now, clean it up.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  Don't video tape.  I am mortified.  Eric, she spilled my chips.  I'm not mortified.  I knew you'd do stuff like this. 
[01:08:00]  Thanks.  She spilled my chips.  Oh, God.  You guinea brat.  Now, clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm mortified.  I apologize for the other half of this program.  Don't apologize.  I don't really care.  That is uncalled for. 
[01:08:30]  That was uncalled for.  I hope you got a good laugh.  I hope you got a good laugh.  God, he's still immersed in it.  It's fine.  He can laugh all day.  I can't even talk to you.  That is horrible, man.  I knew from the start it was a bad idea to bring those in in the first place.  I should have just brought the couch and be done with it.  That is horrible. 
[01:09:00]  Look, I didn't have a problem with him or anything.  I mean, I hope for some reason, I don't understand why he's got to be like that.  Oh, my God.  It hurts so much.  I apologize for the actions of some of the people on the program, you know.  I'll enjoy picking up your poker chips.  Thank you. 
[01:09:30]  You guys can finish your show and talk about me and do whatever you want.  I don't care.  All right.  There she goes.  Wait, wait.  She's walking away.  Wait, can you take these?  Oh, look.  She's getting her stuff.  She's not even going to sit back down.  She's getting her stuff.  Oh, my God.  There she goes.  Because the way you threw them and rolled them across the console, it was a heavy thud  and they rolled and all just fell off.  And the chips were flying out and the chip carrier fell on her foot. 
[01:10:00]  It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen one person do to another.  That's the biggest laugh I've had on the show.  I couldn't breathe.  You are an awful person.  I literally could not breathe.  I was laughing so hard.  I don't know how you do that.  That just makes me so happy.  Those are things you think about doing sometimes, but no human does them.  But Opie, just stay.  I'll break your bowl.  I'll throw the chips at you.  I'll fling the cards at your face. 
[01:10:30]  These chips have coffee stains on them.  These are awful.  See, now you're brave.  I can't be brave with you.  Holy.  The back of my skull hurts.  I laugh so hard.  Eric from Jersey.  The sound of plastic chips raining to the floor is the saddest sound I've ever heard.  It will be like the sound of the thousands of tears she's going to shed in the car.  Yeah.  Just walk outside with her right now.  Yeah.  Gave her a nice garbage bag full of ONA stuff.  She is bawling, crying.  Oh, my God.  See?  I knew it.  Here's what she said. 
[01:11:00]  I knew it.  She goes, I don't mind if he broke it, but he threw it at me.  Oh, no.  And she turned her face into the wall near the elevator.  Oh, my God.  That's all you're hearing.  Stop it.  You are horrible.  Cringe radio is back, boys and girls.  It's about effing time.  It's about effing time.  She threw the chips.  I didn't throw him at her.  No, he didn't throw him at her.  Hold on a minute.  I think he's being smoothed over them.  He actually didn't throw him at her.  I'm going to go check now.  He rolled him across the table. 
[01:11:30]  I was a very good athlete when I was growing up, and trust me, I didn't throw him at her.  Go fix that.  I made it very close.  Go fix that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's awful.  I cannot believe that.  I'm horrified.  All right.  Opie has no soul.  Evil to the core.  Yeah.  That's what they're writing.  And I wonder why I'm alone.  Opie is the effing antichrist. 
[01:12:00]  And I wonder why I'm alone.  I go home alone every day, and I wonder why.  Why am I alone?  Jesus.  Can't figure that one out.  You made her cry.  I didn't want her to cry.  She was nice, and she tried to be good-natured about it.  I know.  She tried to take the ribbing.  It was the loud chips falling before the thing rolled off the console.  That was a big bet.  I'm all in. 
[01:12:30]  I will splash the pot whenever the fuck I please.  Dude, you've got to read something to the end of feedback.  This guy, Cody, from Buffalo.  Opie put some good force into throwing those chips.  Sounds like some South American ring stick.  No, that's...  All right.  Well...  I was horrified during that whole thing.  An update?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Steve's out there.  They're, you know, getting her to breathe and calm down, and they're going to try to see if she wants to come back in and get her picture. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, because she wanted pictures and stuff.  Tell her if she cleans up.  Say you're brave without her in the studio.  That's the difference.  I admit it.  That's the difference between you and I.  Say that to her face.  No, I've done enough.  How have you done enough?  I think I've done enough.  I can't, uh...  I didn't throw it right at her.  Do we have the videotape?  You didn't get that on videotape?  Yeah, I did. 
[01:13:30]  You got that on videotape?  It kind of rolled on the console.  I kind of just rolled it at her.  Okay.  Well...  She had plenty of time to get out of the way.  Oh, my God.  She comes here to give something to the show and get a picture with Opie and Anthony.  Well, maybe she should have gave something to us from this decade.  Who are you to say that our gifts aren't good enough?  You know what?  For now on, we don't want...  Frankincense and myrrh not a good enough gift, Opie.  We're starting a rule on the show.  You bring gifts, don't get them from a garage sale. 
[01:14:00]  That's all we ask.  You know, Baby Jesus' best gift he got was a song from a little drummer boy, Opie.  It had nothing to do with materialism.  It had nothing to do with the gold, frankincense, and myrrh might have been good gifts, but  the little drummer boy's song was the best gift of all.  And I'd have taken that over those lousy chips.  All right.  Well, let me see the video, Anthony.  All right.  Here's the video.  We're looking back at the tape.  She's all smiley.  Steve, I'll need a screening when you're done there. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, my God.  Well, you kind of missed the toss, but you got the aftermath.  I wasn't really expecting you to do that, to be honest.  Oh, gee.  What did you think you were going to do?  Play a hand?  It's like catching a UFO.  You're just not expecting it.  Wow.  That's...  Look at Norton.  This is going to be great for foundrymusic.com.  I'm all in.  Show Anthony.  All right.  Bring that over here.  I got to see that.  I think the audio will really help that clip because you were too close on her face,  but all you see is the chips go flying by her.  All right, well.  All right.  Let me get a look. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  There's Opie with the devious smile on his face.  She's talking.  Still, yes.  Smiling.  Oh, my God.  No, that's...  Oh, you see it clearly.  You see the chips flying by on the table.  Yeah.  Not even trying to comfort her.  Could you face this way when you break down emotionally?  I'm horrified. 
[01:15:30]  I am horrified.  Yeah, I'm not going to fix this one.  See, this is the type of thing, the barrier that people say, you know, how far do you take  things on satellite?  That's where, you know, I think the line should have been drawn somewhere.  Yeah.  This girl's just trying to bring some gifts to the show.  I definitely...  She enjoys...  What?  What?  Give me those.  I'll pass them to her.  You're horrible, man.  That clip is hilarious. 
[01:16:00]  You can see her face.  I mean, in the background, you can see the chips just flying by on the table.  All right.  Well, awful.  Should we take our last break and then regroup here, I guess?  I think, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, that was great.  She's been a fan since the AF days.  Whatever.  The first time in ten years she's going to meet us.  Go buy Demented Worlds and shut up.  No, she's a nice lady.  The All Request Worst Of Show.  Hey, it's Mark Maron from the WTF Podcast.

And maybe that shit that only you seem to remember will get played.  Let's see what's next.  The listener requests voicemail.  Next message.  This is Brian from Pittsburgh.  And one bit that really sticks out in my mind is the one where the boys discuss a story called The Diary of an Unborn Child. 
[01:21:30]  The story is basically journal entry after journal entry from the perspective of a developing fetus.  And yes, it's pretty much as bad as it sounds.  O.P., Anthony, and Jimmy took this terrible story and basically gave it every ounce of justice that it deserved.  Um, I don't think I've ever laughed as hard at anything in my life as much as I heard this story for the first time.  Um, so yeah, that's pretty much it.  So, thanks guys. 
[01:22:00]  Message deleted.  The all-request, Worst of, Worst of, Worst of Show.  October 2nd.  Today, my life began.  My parents do not know it yet.  I am as small as the pollen of a flower.  But it is I already.  I will be a boy.  I will have blonde hair and blue eyes.  Nearly everything is settled already.  October 19th. 
[01:22:30]  I have grown a little, but I am still too small to do anything by myself.  My mother does everything for me, although she still does not know that she is killing me under her heart.  But I am a real person, just as a crumb of bread is still real bread.  My mother exists, and I do too.  October 23rd.  My mouth is just now beginning to open.  Just think, in a year or so, I'll be laughing, or later I'll start to talk.  My first word will be, Mama. 
[01:23:00]  October 23rd.  Today, my heart began to beat.  It will beat softly for the rest of my life.  Never stopping.  After many years, it will tire and stop, and I shall die.  November 2nd.  This is bullshit.  First of all, there's no way to get a tape recorder in there.  And second of all, how come he was talking, and then he says, my mouth is now opening.  Right.  This is crap.  You're right.  This is not real.  I don't think this is a real recording of a fetus. 
[01:23:30]  It's called The Diary of an Unborn Fetus.  Dude, a kid can't eat.  There's no way for a kid to write.  Got no pen in there.  Come on.  Today, I saw a big hog come poke me in the head.  Mommy's still having sex, the slut.  I hear the sound of a vacuum cleaner.  Mommy must be cleaning the rug.  Wait a minute.  It's headed this away.  Oh, no.  My little arm got sucked out. 
[01:24:00]  Jim Abbott, here I come.  My God, man.  Trying to share with everybody.  Today, I'm going on a ride.  Suddenly, the nourishment has stopped from Mama.  What looks like a fist came through the womb, kind of like Freddy did in that original Nightmare on Elm Street when his face comes through the wall. 
[01:24:30]  Just these five knuckles.  Can I continue?  I am growing continually.  My arms and legs are taking shape.  But I must wait a long time before the son makes the arrangement to my mother's corpse.  November 12th. 
[01:25:00]  Tiny fingers are beginning to form on my hands.  How small they are.  One day, I'll stroke my mother's hair and tell her how nice she is.  November 20th.  Only today, the doctor told my mother that I'm living here under her heart.  How happy she must be.  Are you happy, mother?  November 25th.  Today, Mommy got told I'm a mongoloid.  Mother was happy, but Father kicked her down the stairs and said,  Let's make sure this is mine, you pig. 
[01:25:30]  And Mother's parents are not happy because Mother is white, but I am half black and half white.  Mother's father in Do The Right Thing beat her and threw her out of the house for sleeping with Flipper.  Are you insane?  Mommy took thalidomide. 
[01:26:00]  I have arms like a seal.  I'm in the womb only, and already I have thoughts of other men.  I'm Daddy's disappointment.  I'm a woman trapped in a man's body who's still in a woman's body  because I haven't been born yet to humiliate my family with my transgendered nonsense.  In 18 years, I'll be performing sex on someone who thinks I'm a girl. 
[01:26:30]  My mouth opened today, and in a few years, a luscious hog will slip between the lips.  And my little fingers will clutch money that's handed to me, and I'll leap out of the Saturn.  Can I continue?  I'm sorry.  Brought something to the program today.  It's nice.  I like it.  You make a mockery of it.  December 25th. 
[01:27:00]  Today is Thanksgiving.  My mother and father are probably thinking about a name for me.  And they don't even know that I am a little boy.  So they are probably calling me Barbara.  But I want to be called Andy.  December 24th.  Oh, funny every time. 
[01:27:30]  I am growing so big.  December 10th.  My hair is growing.  It is as bright and shiny as the sun.  I wonder what kind of hair my mother has.  December 13th.  My eyes are almost fully developed, although the lids are still shut.  When mother brings me into the world, it will be full of sunshine and overflowing with flowers.  Unless my eyes don't work and I'm black, then Jamie Foxx will play me and annoy the whole country. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, my God.  March 2nd.  Someone left me in Don Geronimo's driveway.  Oh, my God.  Someday I will grow to be big and strong and go swimming in Tommy Lee's pool. 
[01:28:30]  He'll be too busy giving hepatitis to a supermodel to rescue me.  Have the flu, do you, fucker?  Oh, you weren't too sick to let a baby drown.  Can I continue?  Yes.  I don't know why the baby sounds like an old lady when I do it.  Oh, let me tell you, son. 
[01:29:00]  Really fast, go to Chip.  Hey, Chip.  Yes.  What's up, Chip?  Not too much.  Long time listener, first time caller.  Who gives a shit?  And I was just wondering if this was more lost tapes from Demented World.  Are you trying to say that I'm playing the part of the baby?  Sure sounded a lot like yesterday.  Ah, you motherfucker.  I have never seen a flower, you know. 
[01:29:30]  But more than anything, I want to see my mommy.  How do you look, mommy?  December 24th.  I wonder if my mother hears the delicate beat of my heart.  Some children are born with sickly hearts, and then the gentle fingers of a doctor performs miracles to make them healthy.  But my heart is healthy.  It beats so evenly.  Tup, tup, tup, tup.  You shall have a healthy son, mother. 
[01:30:00]  And then one day I'll be born, and mama will bathe me and my four brothers and drown all of us.  I better get used to this water I'm in.  I love my mommy.  Someday she's going to get rich by taking money from an androgynous pale pedophile to poke me in my little pooper.  I want to know what mama looks like, and have my little fingers crossed that she doesn't drive an SUV. 
[01:30:30]  Someday she'll lovingly strap me in a car seat  and back us down a boat ramp  and then wave at me  and blame it on a Jiggaboo.  And all of this hard work will be for naught.  I'll wind up in Andrew Gore's living room in a jar.  And I'll have to look at that freak 
[01:31:00]  for the rest of my existence.  That germaphobe who takes two hours to leave the house.  December 28th.  Today, my mother killed me.  That's terrific.  That's terrific. 
[01:31:30]  Who the hell saw that coming?  And mother only killed me  because I sound like Bobby  when Howie Mandel does him.  Good.  Who the hell saw that coming?  Oh.  Wow.  Mother killed me.  Now I will never cry on a plane  or in a movie theater  and annoy everyone.  Ha ha ha.  You shall have a healthy son, mother. 
[01:32:00]  December 28th.  Oh.  Today, my mother killed me.  Ah!  Is that how it ends?  Oh, I know the point of this.  Why did...  Oh, no.  There's a song?  Yeah.  There's a Why Did My Mommy Kill Me song?  Yes.  Too bad Mother didn't kill me  before I thought of the lyrics  to this awful song.  I gotta hear him say 
[01:32:30]  My Mommy Killed Me.  Oh, you know?  I don't know where that was.  Right behind it.  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And then going into the song is great.  Oh, boy.  I went too far.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  All right.  But my heart is healthy.  Yeah.  It beats so evenly.  Tup, tup.  Tup, tup.  You shall have a healthy son, mother.  That's not your heart.  December 28th.  Today, my mother killed me.  Oh, my God. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Boy, this dumpster is smelly. 
[01:33:30]  Wait, I want to know.  Tool bag, thank you.  I know that the kid is about to sing.  I just want to know what the song is.  We have to actually get to the rest of that.  This kid is really going to annoy me.  All right.  All right.  You ready for the song?  Yes.  The kid's little song.  Everyone, buckle up.  Yes.  All right.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  That's not the song.  I'm sorry.  I pushed the wrong button.  All right.  So you guys are ready for the song, right? 
[01:34:00]  Yes.  You little scumbag.  It's a little harsh.  It's all calm down.  You sound nice and happy and fun.  They're paying for it.  You vacuum it out.  Oh, God.  All right.  Everyone's ready for the song, right?  I don't know.  Oh, my goodness.  I got to rewind the tape.  What's that?  Some kind of sick joke?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  We're ready for the song?  Let's hear the little fetus. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  Here it is.  That's not it.  Wait a minute.  All right.  You ready for the song?  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the song.  End scene.  Oh, God. 
[01:35:00]  All right.  For a little guy.  Here is the song.  Why did you kill me for me when God made me special for you?  I really wanted to see you? 
[01:35:30]  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  And put my little arms around you.  Shut up.  What I would have grown up to be. 
[01:36:00]  It's not a tumor.  It's not a tumor.  I guess I'll never know.  Because mommy, you killed me. 
[01:36:30]  Shut up.  Quiet.  Stop it.  Stop whining.  Oh, jeez.  What a nut.  Why did my mommy kill me?  Who saw that coming?  Wow.  Except for us.  How big is this girl's cunt that a whole band can get in there and play for this kid?  She's got a box like the Titanic.  Kid's being sucked out and the band plays on.  You put your right arm in and the vacuum sucks it out. 
[01:37:00]  I thought he was going to be carried out in his little take the baby home clothes and he's  just in a plastic biohazard bag.  He's laying next to a Reuben behind a building.  Newspapers thrown on him. 
[01:37:30]  Little rats eating his fingers.  Why did my mommy kill me?  What a haunting song.  That's wonderful.  You're going to have to throw that in my...  That's wonderful, that song.  I want this in my instant replay.  That should be in your iPod.  That is a great song.  The listener requests voicemail. 
[01:38:00]  Next message.  The name is Brown.  The bit that I would like to request is when you guys had Ron Sage on and I'm calling from  Greencastle, Pennsylvania.  Again, my name is Bill Brown.  I'd like to request the bit with Ron Sage.  Have a good day.  Message deleted.  And we got Pat, his father Tom, and his lawyer Ron about to enter the studio. 
[01:38:30]  Now, Pat is the Jets fan that was in Indianapolis.  It's all over the news today.  And he got tased by the cop.  Yeah.  He's saying he did nothing wrong.  You're out, Tom.  Come on in.  Are they sure?  Invite him, man.  This should be good.  Pat, with his father and his lawyer.  And his father apparently was a lawyer, too?  Yeah.  Is that what I'm, um, what the boy?  I guess they don't understand the come on in signal.  That's all right.  Hello?  Look at him.  You look a little different. 
[01:39:00]  You look a little different in a suit.  Come on.  All seriousness.  Yeah, they are.  Files and paperwork.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Damn.  It's like, uh...  They got legal briefs.  It's like I'm watching forensic files.  They got briefcases and ties.  That's great.  But I see your father's going with...  Get comfortable, gentlemen.  I see, Pat, your father's going with the casual look without the tie on, right?  Keeping it casual.  You're the lawyer?  I'm the lawyer.  You're the lawyer?  Who's the father?  The father's all dressed up nice, too?  The father looks more like the lawyer. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, I think the lawyer looks more like your father than the father does.  The lawyer's slacking.  The lawyer's slacking.  So, what's up, guys?  A lot of attention there, Pat, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm all over the place.  Yeah, you certainly are.  You look a little different.  What do you do for a living, by the way?  Construction.  Construction?  Underground utility.  Okay.  So, you don't wear that suit often?  Hardly ever.  Yeah.  We understand.  We're like that, too.  CNN and Fox.  Yeah, I figured I should try and look a little better.  You look a little...  Yeah.  Instead of wearing the Jets jersey or something like that.  Right, right.  We were just watching the clip, and the one clip of the Colts fan with the horsey head, 
[01:40:00]  talking to the officer is ridiculous.  He's trying to reason with the cop as he has a big blue horse on his head.  A big horsey head on.  Now, we've been watching the video.  It's been all over TV and the internet all day.  I've been watching this.  And I know NYPD cops pretty well.  I think they're a lot more lax and relaxed when situations happen.  They'll just sit there and blow it off and go, hey, the guy's just blown off steam. 
[01:40:30]  Did these cops seem to be looking for some kind of trouble or...?  Yeah, I guess you've got to walk...  Possibly.  Possibly.  Actually, Pat, walk us through it.  Walk us through it.  Because we're only seeing the video when the cops are pretty much...  Yeah, right there.  He's just like...  Pushing you around and stuff.  Put your hands around your back.  Yeah, but before this, we want to know what was going on.  Like, walk us through...  Yeah, what started the whole melee?  I don't know.  I was just driving... 
[01:41:00]  I was walking around, cheering, whatever.  They're driving through the tailgate.  I didn't know what they were doing, why they were driving through the tailgate.  I never saw anybody just drive through a crowd of people like that.  And, you know, I just...  I'm trying to get out of the way.  Still trying to have fun, though.  Or whatever.  I just...  I kind of looked at the guy like...  I couldn't see in the car or anything.  I just...  I looked over.  I'm like...  You know, I couldn't really get much further out of the way.  I just gave him a little...  Like the shrug kind of, hey, what's up here? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  What are you doing?  And, you know, immediately gets out of the car.  You're under arrest.  Wow.  Did he...  He didn't tell you for me.  What the fuck did you say to me?  Oh, really?  Yeah, all kinds of shit.  Wow.  Did you say anything to him?  I said, I'm getting out of the way.  What are you...  What are you talking about?  I don't know if I said, what are you talking about?  See, right now, he's putting...  It looks like...  Danny, go back a little bit.  This is what we just...  Walk us through it, because it looks like the cop is...  He's...  Hold on.  Wait until we get to the...  I want to fast forward a little bit.  He certainly does fling you on that trunk. 
[01:42:00]  Jesus Christ.  The cop car is really just driving right through the middle of it.  Driving through people.  Yeah, yeah.  There were two cars.  Yeah, two cars.  Two cars.  This guy gets out.  He gets out of the car.  He's walking over to you right now.  But it looks like he's pointing over your right shoulder.  You can hear it on YouTube.  He says, what the fuck did you say to me?  Oh, could you turn it up?  Do you have the volume?  Yeah, you fucking...  It would help.  Cursing.  We're going to listen.  Get back!  Get the fuck in your neck from here!  You got to fuck your car!  You got to fuck my car! 
[01:42:30]  You got to fuck my car!  You got to fuck my car!  You got to fuck my car!  They're single you out.  They said I was cursing at everybody.  Wow.  And throwing beer and taunting other fans.  None of that is true, which baffles me.  I really don't see how they had any reason to arrest me.  I missed the whole game.  I was just...  Hold, Danny, pause just one second.  Damn.  Yeah, the cop does jump out and go, what the fuck did you say?  It is almost like a schoolyard thing. 
[01:43:00]  Like, you know, the cop jumps out, what the fuck did you say to me?  He said, what's your fucking problem?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's past father, man.  Now, at one point, because as I'm watching the tape, it does look like you're not putting  your hands behind your back.  That kind of gets like...  He didn't say anything.  He said, get up against the car.  And I'm like, all right, all right.  I get up against the car, and then he's like, you know, I'm like, what did I do?  I might have said something like that, and then I go to the back of the hood, like he 
[01:43:30]  throws me to the back of the hood.  I didn't know he wanted me to go to the back of the hood.  Now, when he grabs your arms, you kind of pull that left arm away from him.  I do a little bit.  I went like this.  And that's when he kind of gets a little rambunctious.  You know, what do you want me to do?  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't say that, but I didn't know he was trying to get me to put my hands behind my  back.  I was trying to, you know, obey and just get along as easy as possible.  Was pulling your arm forward kind of an instinct because you're just all of a sudden, one minute  you're standing there, and the next minute you feel like you're being thrown  against the car, and like, what the fuck?  Yeah, it was my instinct of like, you know, get off of me, basically. 
[01:44:00]  What do you want?  Plus, the cop was treating him like, it looked like the cop was trying to treat him like  to bitch him out.  Like, I'm a batter-ass, fuck you.  And that's an instinct for a guy to be like, fuck, you know.  So he puts you against the car, and then on the next moment, your arms are behind your  back.  And then, you know, my arms are behind my back, and they're saying, put your arms behind  your back, put your arms, and I'm like, they are behind my back right now.  And at that time, the taser was on my back, too.  And I'm like, fuck. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Oh, you got tasered?  I didn't actually get tasered.  He was, you know, I felt it charged, and I thought I was tasered the whole time in like,  jail afterwards until yesterday.  Somebody said, the police reported out that I wasn't actually stunned or anything.  The picture was ominous.  I know.  The front page picture was like, ah!  If he was actually tasered, he would have been on the ground like a piece of bacon frying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I thought.  I'm thinking, well, if I was tasered, I probably would have been a lot more. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  So what did they charge you with, if anything?  Disorderly conduct and public intoxication.  Public intoxication.  Have you been drinking three beers?  Two and a half.  You saw the beer get thrown on the ground.  The third beer went on the ground right there.  You saw it?  How many hot dogs did you have?  I had a decent breakfast.  So they, had you been arrested before?  No.  No?  So you didn't, yeah, know exactly, you know, hey, I put my hands behind my back.  Yeah, I didn't know what to do.  Oh, okay. 
[01:45:30]  So, and then they take you to some kind of holding facility where you then miss the entire game?  The entire game.  Eight hours.  To both games, I saw half of the Jets game here and there.  You know, I like to watch the game.  I watched every game this year.  Every game probably, my life, I don't know.  Wow.  But you weren't tasered.  See, I didn't know that.  So what is the story now?  Like, you get put up against a car, they probably, from what it looks like, it looks like maybe  they overreacted a little bit and they shouldn't have done that and the guy was alpha mailing  and pissed off that you probably, you know, you were like watching. 
[01:46:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what he, I guess.  So what is the push of this?  Is there a lawsuit or a lawyer?  I'm not sure.  Lawyer?  What do you think?  I think we're looking at it.  I mean, I think my take on this whole thing is that...  There, hit a mic there, lawyer.  There it is.  You got me now?  Actually, Ron.  Ron the lawyer.  Thanks.  I think you had some overzealous, out-of-control police officers, maybe some overzealous Colts  fans.  I think if he didn't have a Jets jersey on, they probably wouldn't have grabbed him.  I also think, I also think that, you know, what the Indianapolis people have to be concerned 
[01:46:30]  about, and we don't blame the Indianapolis people or the Colts, but we think this, you  know, I'm saying if he had a Colts jersey on, it wouldn't have happened.  I'm saying the Colts people come here to New York, you know, they come to the Meadowlands.  Hopefully, there's no retaliation by our local police.  But I think, I think, I'm concerned about, I'm concerned about out-of-state, out-of-state  fans, whether they're police or not, abusing our Jets fans, and I hope that there's no retaliation  by our local New York police or Jersey police against Indianapolis fans or fans from any 
[01:47:00]  other team that came into that.  Well, can I ask the attorney, because you figure, it looked like, I feel that, man, maybe they  overreacted a little bit, but you weren't beaten in custody or anything like that.  You weren't injured by the police.  No.  It sucks you missed the game, sure.  But what is, like, what is, when you sue, what are you saying we want?  Well, let me just tell you this.  When you're a 26-year-old kid who's never been in trouble before, and if you look at  that film, you see the way that cop grabbed him. 
[01:47:30]  You see the way the cop tried to jam his head against the trunk of that police car.  You see the way they pushed him around.  They treated him like he was their punk, like he was their bitch.  That's the way they treated him.  And then they grab him, they throw him in the back of the car, they lock him up, they keep  him in jail for eight hours.  They kind of tacitly coerce his old man into, you know, putting him in a diversionary program,  paying $150 and letting him out so he won't have any kind of record, and he can go home.  If you don't think that traumatizes a kid, you're wrong.  It does traumatize a kid because he's never been in trouble before in his life. 
[01:48:00]  Well, he's not a kid.  He's an adult.  And I'm not saying that you were right to be arrested, but you are an adult.  He's a kid to me.  He's old enough to serve in the military.  He's an adult.  But my issue is, even though I agree, it was an overreaction.  I do agree with you.  But it was, it just seems like, what are you saying when you're suing them, like, to get  one?  Maybe you should be refunded the game.  I'm saying this.  Or even the airline tickets.  I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm saying, do something with the police.  You see, what you had here was no more than a regular tailgate party.  And you've been to a tailgate party at the Meadowlands.  This is no different than what was going on there. 
[01:48:30]  If you can't get the police, who are trained well enough to handle a tailgate party, which  is what this was, retrain them, reassign them, get rid of them on the police force, have  the police respond in damages somehow so that there's some preventive measure so that they  won't do it again.  Wait, can I, yeah, I know what Jimmy's going to say, and I want to say the same thing.  You see the police car going right through the tailgating party.  What was going on that they felt like they had to break up that part of the parking lot  with their police cars?  I'm sure it was just some yelling back and forth between the fans. 
[01:49:00]  No.  No fights, nothing like that, right?  No fights.  No.  So it was just a basic...  Just kind of breaking balls, probably.  They wanted the parking spaces.  I guess it was...  They said they needed, they wanted to make room for other cars to pull in.  So there's no real reason for them to be aggressive with their cars to begin with.  No, they wanted to make, there was a lot of empty spots, and there were people that were  going to be coming, this was two hours before the game, there were people that were  going to be coming that were going to need spots, you know, they had permits, but nobody  came and said, we want to park and we're prevented. 
[01:49:30]  Right.  And they didn't come on a speaker and say, hey, we need to make room.  Sure.  You know, but the one guy with the whistle, I think they were mad about him, and then  they came back with a second car, and that's when they drove through the crowd.  And then they wrote a report, and the worst thing about it is they write a report, an  affidavit the guy signs, that says Pat was cursing, throwing beer at people, and that  he then went up to Pat and some other guy, and there was no other guy there when he got 
[01:50:00]  arrested, but he wrote an affidavit saying that he arrested two people at the same time.  And he said, I told those two guys to stop, and they refused, they kept cursing at people,  and then I put him under arrest.  And, you know, when I saw that report, when I got him out of jail, I said to the prosecutor,  I said, no, no, this is the wrong report.  This isn't it.  And she goes, no, look, there's his name on the bottom.  I said, well, that's not what happened.  And it's on video, so.  And then you look at the video, and you look at the report, and it's two totally different  things.  Wow.  So, you know, they lied on the report.  Okay.  And if they did it to him, they're doing it to other people. 
[01:50:30]  So, you know.  Were there any incidents that day, because you're saying they should better train the police department,  were there any incidents that day, of any type of police brutality or allegations that  they, other than this event, where they probably overreacted?  I don't know.  We don't know.  I don't know.  And what are the calls, what was their response?  Have they had a response to you yet?  No.  Okay, so what is it you want from them, or the city?  Well, I want a couple things.  Pat doesn't concern about an apology. 
[01:51:00]  He's not concerned about an apology, but I think he deserves one.  I think I'd like to see these police retrained.  I'd like to see them reassigned.  I'd like to see them out of the way of, I'm using the expression, kids at these tailgate  parties, or adults.  I mean, if they don't understand that when there's an AFC championship game, and people  come a couple hundred miles to watch the game, and guys like my two friends here, who are  rabid Jets fans, are going to get, you know, the way people get at tailgate parties, then  get them the hell out of there.  Is tailgating legal there?  You know, put some police officers there who have some self-discipline, some self-control,  and if not, then they're going to have to pay. 
[01:51:30]  They're going to have to pay some money so it doesn't happen to other people.  Can I ask you a question?  How about a beer with the president?  Yeah, exactly.  My only issue is you're saying, like, you're saying control and stuff.  And again, I don't, was the cop really out of control?  Yeah, he was out of control.  He didn't hit you.  Look at the tape.  He grabs and, hey, hey, hey, look at the cop who has the taser on the back of his neck  ready to go.  He activated that taser, he was ready to go.  I don't know if the taser just didn't work at that time, or if he didn't push that button  to make it go, but that cop was ready to taser this kid, and this kid didn't do anything. 
[01:52:00]  What if their argument was, though, like, you know, look, we didn't know exactly what  condition he was in.  You always have to assume the worst when you're dealing with a bunch of rowdy male fans, and  you put him up against the car, and his arm did pull away.  And again, mine probably would have, too.  It's not like you think you were going to beat up cops.  But in that moment, your arm pulls away, and then the cop gets behind you with the taser,  like, all right, in case, and then nothing happens, so he does not use the taser.  And that's the same bullshit we hear every time somebody's abused by the police.  That's the same bullshit the police always come out with. 
[01:52:30]  They show you frame by frame to say, look, he moved his arm to the left.  He's resisting arrest.  We were concerned about being assaulted.  You hear that crap all the time, and it's bullshit.  And it was bullshit and pesky.  Sometimes it's legit, but watching this as many times, it just seems like he was getting  a little overzealous, the officer.  Absolutely.  And to single, you've got to look at the whole thing.  You can't just look at him slamming him into the trunk.  He looked like he singled you out for no apparent reason. 
[01:53:00]  Like, I didn't see any reason why he would get out of his car, even, and approach you.  You were doing nothing different than anybody else.  He didn't like your attitude, which I don't think is an arrestable offense.  How do you even see or hear his attitude?  Cops are nervous, too.  They're regular guys, and they're going into a, driving into a, all these guys, testosterone.  They're insecure, too.  They're real insecure.  Yeah, you know what?  If he would have kept driving, he was ready to go, though.  He was ready to go.  If they would have just kept driving, there would have been no problem. 
[01:53:30]  Most cops are insecure, guys.  That cop's going, what the fuck did you do?  That, to me, is sign the cop is looking to be confrontational, unnecessarily.  Then I say, why doesn't he just say what really happened in his report?  I mean, if he felt that way, why didn't he just say what happened?  Why did he make up this crap about cursing, throwing beer at people?  None of that happened.  That's just crazy.  You know when you get into a fight, though?  I mean, he was probably nervous, too, driving into a bunch of guys.  He wasn't in a fight when he wrote that report.  In your head, the same thing, you don't know the details. 
[01:54:00]  After you come out, you're like, oh, well, I was so crazy, I don't know what happened, too.  He should have been, you know, more responsible, I think.  I'm not making an excuse.  Yeah, I know.  You're right.  He just said no communication whatsoever to me.  I asked a few people, what are they doing here?  Nobody knew.  I think a momentary overreaction by a cop, in that moment, it doesn't justify retraining.  Had he used that taser?  Totally different.  I mean, had he tased you or knocked you the ground?  The picture on the front page of the paper was like, wow, this kid got tased.  And lucky for him, you're a white kid, because, oh boy, if you'd have been a black kid, that 
[01:54:30]  would have been all over Johnny.  That cop would be somewhere, fired, suspended, something like that.  Keith Robinson got cops home, and they pepper sprayed him, and he pooped his pants.  Yeah, he should have pepper sprayed him.  He was six cops, a comedian we know, and he just wouldn't put his hands behind his back.  Keith is an asshole.  Then he goes like this, pepper spray me, bitch, I eat that for breakfast.  And they did, and he went, oh! 
[01:55:00]  And they gave him some breakfast, and he shit his pants.  He shit his pants.  Oh my God.  How did I not know about this?  Hold on, we got a couple of really good phone calls coming in here.  If the lawyer, get some headphones.  Who for the lawyer or Roger Daltrey?  I can't wait to see you at halftime, sir.  He's on a show called Kung Fu.  And maybe the cop didn't like Will Ferrell movies or something.  It looks like Will Ferrell.  Russell Peters has made a show here. 
[01:55:30]  Let's say hi to Mike in New York.  Mike.  Mike.  Carl, can you hear?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Mike.  Hey, listen, this guy, this kid got a bad beat, all right?  What happened, it sounds like, yeah, he got assaulted, and he got a bad beat.  He got thrown in jail.  Okay, it happens.  But, Jimmy, I think you're hitting a fair point.  What are you getting out of this?  This is where the lawyers come in, and I see this as a financial opportunity.  The lawyers are going to hop all over it.  You know what, kid?  I think it should be in reverse for your ticket, reimbursed for your tickets.  But these lawyers come in, and they start telling them and telling them, 
[01:56:00]  look, financial opportunity.  That's the problem with America today is that the lawyers are all over the place.  Well, you think this is an issue of financial opportunity for the lawyers,  and you're an asshole.  How about that?  Because this guy's got nothing to do with financial opportunity, jerk-off.  This has to do with the fact that a kid who drove hundreds of miles to get to a football game  to watch a team he's been cheering for since he was born  get thrown in jail for eight hours and get kicked around by the police.  If you think this is a financial opportunity for lawyers,  then you've got some retraining to do yourself, pal. 
[01:56:30]  Did you fly or drive?  Hey, Flo, do you get that?  You think this is a financial opportunity?  I'm talking about retraining.  I'm talking about reassigning.  I'm talking about not having some out-of-control asshole grabbing a kid  because he doesn't know how to handle a tailgate party,  which is no different from any party that you might have ever been to at the Meadowlands.  Do you get that?  Just do you get that?  I think your lawyer is overreacting.  If you don't get that, then get the hell off the phone because you're wasting my time.  This lawyer is going to tase you.  Wow.  All right.  Let's go to the next call. 
[01:57:00]  Verbally tased.  We've got someone calling from Indianapolis.  Steve.  Steve.  Hey, boys.  Thanks for taking the call.  You know, first of all, thanks for coming to Indianapolis and spending your hard-earned money.  We can use the cash here.  Second of all, to the attorney, I believe you said it twice that you hope that it doesn't happen to Indianapolis Wolves fans  when they come to the Meadowlands by the local police.  I see that as a threat.  And also, by the way you just handled that last call, you're clearly doing a disservice to your profession 
[01:57:30]  by calling somebody an asshole when you're there on the dime.  Come on, dude.  I'm not sure what your question is.  But, you know what, whatever it is, if you perceive what I'm saying as a threat, I'm just telling you this.  I don't.  I don't.  But there are those people who would think that if a Jets fan goes out to Indianapolis  and he's treated the way this kid was treated out there, that it is possible.  It is possible that we've got some loose heads out here in the New York, New Jersey area  that might get a hold of somebody in a Colts jersey who had a few drinks and decide to treat him the same way. 
[01:58:00]  How would you like that if that was your brother, your mother, your father, or your kid, son?  How would you like that before you start talking about out of control?  It sounds like he pulled away from the cop, which is clearly actionable by the police officer, to protect himself.  Pulled away from the cop?  You sound like somebody who'd be defending Rodney King.  Dude, no, I'm not.  And the Indianapolis Police Department, by the way, they have to patrol this thing called Black Expo every year in Indianapolis, 
[01:58:30]  which every black youth comes out to party his ass off.  So now you're a racist on top of being an asshole, now you're a racist.  Now you're a racist.  Now you're putting the black-white thing into this?  I know this is radio, pal, but these are white people we're talking about here.  This has got nothing to do with black people?  You're not demonstrating your professionalism by using that type of word.  I mean, you can do that on the opening ANC show, but come on, you're there as an attorney.  Why don't you use some regular words? 
[01:59:00]  You mean like you just did, like fucking?  Like you just did?  What do you do for a living, character?  What do you do?  I'm a salesperson.  You're a salesperson.  What do you sell?  I sell pharmaceuticals.  Oh, you sell pharmaceuticals.  Well, that's a great industry.  Drug dealer.  Hey, you're a goddamn drug dealer is what you are.  Hey, listen, friend, I want to tell you this, too.  I want to tell you this.  Now shut up and listen for a second.  My friends tell me that they found everybody in Indianapolis to be some of the most gentlemanly kindest, nicest people they had ever run across. 
[01:59:30]  And the statements we make about the police involved in this incident, perhaps, and I'm not sure, but perhaps some rogue cops who lost control of themselves for a few minutes.  What I'm telling you is that is not to us meant to characterize the entire folks out there in Indianapolis.  These guys tell me that they had a great experience out there until this incident happened.  They got nothing but high opinions of the Indianapolis folks out there and probably the police out there are a good bunch.  And we get it.  You know what?  I'm a prosecutor locally where I come from, and I work with police on a regular basis. 
[02:00:00]  But I recognize there are rogue police officers out there.  I'm not saying these are rogue police officers, but I'm saying these are not police officers who ought to be able to handle, who ought to be assigned to handle tailgate parties.  You really disagree with that?  I mean, if you looked at that tape, are you telling me you think this kid deserved to be roughed up, handcuffed, thrown in a car, locked up for eight hours?  Are you telling me you think that was okay?  Are you telling me you think that was okay or not?  He's gone there, sir.  All right.  I have a question for the attorney. 
[02:00:30]  What's your name?  I don't want to just recall.  Ron Sage.  Do you handle cases of talent who has disputes with their radio companies?  I was right there.  Ron, we want to talk after the show.  We have some things to be worked on here.  We want to hire you to talk to our bosses.  Set them straight.  I want you to call them friend and pal and champ and all that.  Can Ron sit up straight if you want to?  Ron, you can if you want.  I like it.  Hold on.  There's been a dispute here.  You said drove for eight hours, and you said Continental for the breakfast.  Did you fly in?  No, the Continental breakfast. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, okay.  I think you flew in.  We stayed the night before.  Okay.  We flew out of Philly to Washington to Dayton.  Okay.  And then drove about an hour and a half out of Dayton, Ohio.  Damn.  And then the way home, our flight guy canceled out of Washington.  Dayton was sucked.  We were watching.  They rent a car to Philadelphia.  I think the Colts should forfeit the Super Bowl because of this.  Let the Jets go in.  That's what I think.  Can you get that, Ron?  Pat, you didn't miss anything.  The game sucked.  You missed two good quarters.  Yeah, really.  Yeah, imagine if they won, how pissed you'd be. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, man.  Hey, we got some inside info here.  Who's this, sir?  Hello?  Yeah, yeah, brother.  Go.  It's Exec Protect.  How you doing, guys?  All right, man.  Hey, Ron, question.  Yeah.  Was a cop a reserve cop?  Did I read that?  I understand he was specially assigned.  Oh, boy.  Was he special ed assigned?  Was he a part-time cop?  I understand he's a full-time cop somewhere, but was specially assigned to a security detail at the game. 
[02:02:00]  Okay, which means that he probably doesn't know how to handle crowd control, right?  Well, he didn't know how to handle this crowd control.  No, without it.  Because if you look at the video, you can see, and I'm a security specialist, and reaction, and people's body language,  and I'm sure you can understand that being a prosecutor, you can see how he just seems to be,  I live upstate New York where they have these part-time policemen, and these guys get about six months of training, 
[02:02:30]  or six weeks of training, and usually it's the guys who cannot become full-time policemen.  I thought I read somewhere he was a reserve cop.  Dude, what mall do you work at?  I don't know.  Anthony, obviously, I'm a reserve cop.  Let's say hi.  Everybody wants to say hi.  Let's say hi to Jared.  Jared.  Hey, Jared.  What's up, man?  Jared.  Speak and be spoken to.  Oh, my God.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead, bud.  Hey, man.  Look, Jimmy said it a little while ago. 
[02:03:00]  This guy is 26 years old.  He's not a kid.  Stop referring to him as a kid.  He's an adult.  It sucks he went to jail.  Boo fucking hoo.  I went to jail with Mardi Gras.  Fucking deal with it.  Quit calling him a kid.  He's an adult.  Is that your problem?  I'm calling him a kid?  Is that why you're calling?  Because you've got a problem to refer to a 26-year-old guy as a kid?  I'm calling it.  Is that your problem?  No, sir.  I don't know how.  All right.  Well, then what is your problem?  What is your problem?  And why did you get arrested at Mardi Gras?  What the hell did you do at Mardi Gras? 
[02:03:30]  And did you deserve to be arrested?  Did you deserve to be arrested at Mardi Gras?  Did you?  Did you deserve to get arrested at Mardi Gras?  Somebody pushed me, and I bumped into a cop.  I went to jail for eight hours.  You punched the cop.  You punched the cop.  Did you see this tape?  Did you see this kid do anything?  You punched the cop.  No, I did.  Stop it.  Your problem is referring to him as a kid.  How old are you, pal?  I'm 43, sir.  And you punched the cop.  How old were you when you punched the cop? 
[02:04:00]  How old were you when you punched the cop?  How old were you when you punched the cop?  How old were you when you punched the cop?  Were you over 30?  Yeah, whatever, dude.  Oh, whatever, dude.  Whatever, dude.  Another asshole.  Okay, let's go.  Jimmy, don't let this guy get off with this shit.  All right, let's go to Mike and Boston.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, this is for the lawyer. 
[02:04:30]  You mentioned that you wanted the police in Indianapolis to be retrained.  Yeah.  And then you, which I can understand, but you also mentioned that you're worried about  the New York and New Jersey cops coming back at Indianapolis fans.  Do you have any intention of training or putting forth some sort of action to train these hypothetical  New York and New Jersey cops that are going to rough up an Indy fan?  Hey, hey, hey, you know what?  Have you ever heard of this happening in the Meadowlands?  And you haven't, have you? 
[02:05:00]  And the reason you haven't is because down here we train our cops so that they know how  to handle tailgate parties, which is what this was.  This wasn't some out-of-control crazy affair.  This tailgate parties with young people and older people who were drinking or partying.  You said you're afraid of it happening.  Huh?  You said you're afraid of it happening.  Well, you know what?  I mean, frankly speaking, there are those people who saw this incident and said,  what the hell are the Indianapolis police doing?  If it's Indianapolis police, so I understand it's Speedway police or some adjacent town.  What are they doing thinking about tasering a kid for nothing?  And I'm saying that there are those people who might be thinking about, hey, you know, 
[02:05:30]  maybe somebody with a cold jersey on ought to have a taser stuck on the back of his neck  and locked up for eight hours to see whether or not this is the kind of behavior that's  approved on.  That's all I'm saying.  You're worried about it.  So what are you going to, what actions are you going to take to prevent that from happening  since you're so concerned about this happening in New York, New Jersey?  Well, what action do you think I'm going to take, Jerkoff?  I'm not the governor of the state.  I'm not the governor of the state.  I'm just another schmuck lawyer from a small town.  I'm just some country bumpkin from Freehold, New Jersey. 
[02:06:00]  What the hell do you think I'm going to do about it?  I can't make the law.  Come on.  Because you want to make changes happen in Indianapolis, though, don't you?  I want these cops to be retrained or reassigned.  Sure, they can't handle crowd control.  They can't handle the tailgate party.  You want your kid to be at a tailgate party where this kind of crap happens to a 26-year-old  guy?  I mean, for nothing?  You want your kid subjected to that?  You want him locked up for eight hours in front of his dad?  You want him to be traumatized?  That's not what I called about.  You think that's okay?  Then what did you call about?  Did you forget my question already? 
[02:06:30]  I think you might have forgot your question.  You want me to come up with some retraining for the Meadowlands police who don't need it  is what I got.  And I think maybe you're smoking something because you don't seem to get the drift of this conversation.  Your comment earlier said you were worried about it happening.  I'm concerned there might be some folks from some folks who think about retaliation.  Let me tell you something.  If this kid had a Colts jersey on, I don't think it would have happened to him.  But he had a Jets jersey on, and I think that had something to do with this incident. 
[02:07:00]  Okay, so you are going to pursue some sort of action to prevent it from happening from  the New York or New Jersey Police Department is what you're saying.  Well, you know, I don't pursue anything involving the New York, New Jersey Police Department because  I don't have that kind of authority.  You get that?  You get that?  I'm not the governor of the state.  I'm not a senator.  I'm not a congressman.  I'm nothing like that.  Do you have that authority in Indianapolis, son?  Just a suggestion.  Just a recommendation, son.  Calm down.  All right, let's go to Brian in Nebraska.  Brian.  Yes. 
[02:07:30]  I got to say, man, Ron's got the phones lit.  Yes, Brian.  What about the cop side of this?  I mean, have you ever thought about them having to deal with all those drunk assholes all the  time?  Yeah, but have you ever thought about this kid not being one of them drunk assholes?  What do you think?  The police should regard everybody as a drunken asshole and treat everybody like they're drunken  assholes because they have a couple of drunken assholes?  Everybody says they always had a couple.  Bullshit.  They have always more than that.  You think this kid was one?  Did you see the tape here?  No, I haven't seen the tape yet.  Then get off the phone.  You don't know what the hell you're talking about. 
[02:08:00]  Watch the tape.  Call me back.  Watch the tape.  Call me back.  All right, let's go to Kevin from Connecticut.  Kevin.  Hi, we'll talk to the lawyer.  Yeah.  Ron is here.  Yeah.  Hey, Ed Asmok.  Can you back off the mic?  Jesus Christ.  Oh.  Well, he was getting excited.  He was breathing.  Of course.  Yeah.  Ron, you were breathing about it.  I was breathing too loud.  You're going to stop him from breathing, asshole?  Let's go to Jonathan from Connecticut.  Jonathan.  Hey, guys. 
[02:08:30]  Hey.  I'm an attorney in New York and Connecticut.  I agree completely with this attorney.  I just think he's made a slight error in not being more specific.  There's no money involved in this for this lawyer.  He's not going to make jack shit.  Thank you.  It's a minimalist case.  It's something called deterrence.  He's trying to deter this shit from happening ever again.  Thanks.  Anybody else in any city, whether it's New York, New Jersey, or Indianapolis, or my fucking state  of Connecticut.  You got it.  You got it, pal.  You got it. 
[02:09:00]  Hey, does Pat have a record now?  Whalers left.  Nothing.  Lacrosse.  No record.  No record for Pat.  He's got an arrest record, actually.  I was going to say, can you guys get the arrest record removed?  Do you know that?  Well, he's not going to have a record when this is done because his dad, his dad, here  let me have his dad answer that question.  Hang on a second.  The papers that he actually signed said that he had a, we were just trying to get out of  Dodge that night, and the papers that he signed for this agreement said that he can't,  he had to agree that he couldn't expunge the arrest record. 
[02:09:30]  I didn't understand that, but, you know, it's a dismissal, but there'll be an arrest record.  Why wouldn't they want, why would the cops want you to sign that?  Because does it make them look bad, or like they waste the time if it's expunged?  They wanted him to sign a paper that would basically, I think the idea behind it was to relieve them  from any potential liability.  And, you know, I think, you know, reading between the lines on that, that's what it says.  Whether it actually does or not remains to be seen.  Right.  If they drop the charges, then it's like, they're probably thinking you could step in and go, 
[02:10:00]  all right, now look at what you did to me for nothing.  Yeah.  Instead of having some kind of charges there.  Yeah, yeah.  We got more people on the phone, too.  Oh, yeah, we got this guy from Long Island.  Sir, what do you got for the lawyer or Pat or Pat's father, Tom?  For the lawyer, what I have is if you get a settlement or they offer you a settlement,  are you going to turn down a settlement and go through what you want to go through with?  Or are you going to take the settlement?  Well, see, first off, I have clients. 
[02:10:30]  I don't make these decisions.  These decisions are made by my clients to what they want to accept.  But in terms of whether a settlement would be accepted, you know, I agree with the lawyer  who just called in from, I believe, Connecticut.  And that is my primary focus.  My primary focus.  And there may be Indiana lawyers involved in this case or Illinois lawyers at some point  in time.  But my primary focus is to make sure this kind of crap doesn't happen again, period.  Okay.  Out there or anywhere else.  That's my primary focus.  My name is Taint Lover, by the way. 
[02:11:00]  But anyway, what I wanted to say was, you know, the Taint Lover.  Who the hell named you that?  What the hell?  Your mother looked at you when you were born and said, I'm going to name you Taint Lover?  Ooh.  The hell was wrong with your father?  Ooh.  Not all-inclusive of the whole incident.  Ooh.  Not all-inclusive.  And we'll find out at trial.  Ooh.  Yeah, we'll find out.  Stay tuned.  All right, we got Norm in Cape Cod.  Norm?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  This lawyer is just such a piece of trash.  He's a typical ambulance chaser. 
[02:11:30]  For him to sit here and say he wouldn't make any money off a civil suit is a complete lie.  The kid signed off saying that basically that he had done something, and he signed off.  He's done.  That's all.  End of discussion.  That's the end of discussion?  Then shut the fuck up and get off the phone, you stupid ass.  Oh, you're completely wrong.  You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You talk like a goddamn asshole.  You don't have any common sense.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Did you even see the tape here?  Did you even see the tape? 
[02:12:00]  Yes, I have.  Yes, I have.  You see the tape?  What do you think?  What did you see the boy do wrong?  You're an ambulance chaser.  What did you see the boy do wrong?  What did you see the boy do wrong before we shut off your mic?  What part of your lobe did you have removed when you went to get your outlaw?  You're a piece of shit.  All right.  All right.  Well, you are.  That's all you are.  You're an ambulance chaser.  Look at your own website.  Look at your own website, garbage.  Ooh.  Okay.  Nice talking to you.  Look at your own website.  Your own website.  Oh, we won't.  I won't charge you until we get a cell.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[02:12:30]  Next case.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Ficious.  He's very bitter.  Where's Tom?  Is he hiding?  He wouldn't say what he saw on that tape, though.  Hey, are you a single?  Hey, Ron, are you a family friend besides the lawyer?  It seems like you guys know each other pretty well, huh?  I've known Pat since he was born, and Tom and I used to work together for years.  Right on.  All right.  Let me say hi to Cody in PA.  I don't know what he wants to talk about.  Let's see.  Cody.  Hey, yes.  I just wondered I had a comment for Ron.  Sure.  He's the lawyer.  Yep. 
[02:13:00]  There's lawyers like you who are like tampons to every push that that kid needs one.  Oh, that's a horrible joke.  Oh, man.  What does that mean?  You are an obvious asshole, too.  I'll tell you.  This is...  This is...  I don't know.  You know, I say this is one asshole call after another.  I swear to God.  All right.  One stupid-ass joke after another.  What do you do for a living, pal?  He's gone.  Let's go to Jim in Boston.  Jim.  Yeah.  Well, this is what kind of fucks with me.  Like, during the actual arrest, maybe it was a stressful situation. 
[02:13:30]  The cop might have overreacted.  You can maybe explain that away.  But afterwards, when he files a false police report, there's no stress.  He's not in a crowd.  He's by himself lying on a police report.  Absolutely.  And that's the problem.  You got it nailed.  I'm going to let his father respond to that.  I'm going to let Tom Allen respond to that.  He's an attorney as well.  Hang on just a second.  All right.  Well, fuck Joe DeRosa.  Yeah, absolutely.  He was part of the case.  You just don't know it yet.  Tom?  That's what it's all about.  That's, you know, Pat was in jail. 
[02:14:00]  He shouldn't have been.  But the worst part about it is they lied about him.  They said that he was drunk.  He wasn't.  They said that he was cursing at people.  He wasn't.  They said he was throwing beer at people.  He wasn't.  He even said that he tried to go up to him and tell him to stop.  And he didn't.  You know, it's not just one.  I mean, it wasn't little mistakes that he made writing a report.  These were bold-faced lies.  I mean, he sat down and tried to explain why they treated him so badly.  But unfortunately, it was on video. 
[02:14:30]  Unfortunately, there was a New York Post.  Unfortunately for him, there was a New York Post photographer right there and people videotaping it.  And then, you know, he got caught in a lie.  I don't think that's unfortunate.  Someday, you guys are going to love that front page.  You know that.  Someday, you're going to love that one.  That was cool.  We've been on the front page before.  And trust me, enough time goes by.  You're like, hey, that's pretty fucking cool.  And for the callers using profanity, serious calls only, please.  Yeah, absolutely.  Let's go to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie.  What's up, boys?  Hey. 
[02:15:00]  Hey, Ron, right?  Yeah, Ron.  Hey, how you doing?  I just want to say you're a breath of fresh air.  I like how you are.  You shoot from the head.  You tell it how it is.  You know what I mean?  None of this.  More cliches.  Boyer garbage.  But I got to say, I hope you win this case.  Because there's a case in Philly where an off-duty police officer shot a 19-year-old kid in cold blood at a party.  These cops take their authority way too far. 
[02:15:30]  And they're trained to be level-headed when they get into a situation.  These guys are just too quick with the trigger.  Absolutely.  Wow.  All right.  There you go.  Let's go to Peter in Massachusetts.  I don't know.  I want to say I don't know the specifics of that case.  But until I'm not passing judgment on anybody.  There you go.  Exactly.  What was the guy doing at the party?  Maybe he took all the chips.  Yes.  We could have double-dipped.  We need more details on that case.  Let's go to Peter in Massachusetts.  Peter.  Yeah, I'd like to know what this shyster's charging this unemployed alcoholic to fucking get some money. 
[02:16:00]  Ron, you'd like to tip him back a little bit?  Well, if you were listening, my friend, you'd understand this is a construction worker.  This is not an unemployed alcoholic.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Where does he fucking work?  At the fucking local bar?  He lifted in 16-ounce curls?  You fucking shyster pig?  Look at this guy.  You know, you sound a little bitter.  You might have had a few issues yourself.  Have you ever been institutionalized?  Have you ever been institutionalized?  Seriously, have you ever had any mental counseling or anything like that? 
[02:16:30]  You sound like you're a little unglued.  Sound like you're a little bitter.  Sound like you've got a few issues.  Yeah, I do.  I have issues with fucking shysters who go after police officers for doing their fucking job,  you fat fuck.  He doesn't even know what he looks like.  Sorry, Bobby.  He's actually in shape for an older guy.  He wasn't talking to me, Opie.  He was talking to Ron.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You fluctuate, Bobby.  Don't worry about it.  Fluctuating, Bob.  Bobby says, buddy, he's open. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  Have I still got you on the line?  Ron.  Yeah, we got him, Ron.  Have I still?  You still on the line?  Yes.  The Ron kind.  All right.  Are you still on the line here, pal?  Yeah, he's still on the line.  Yeah, I'm here, you fucker.  All right.  Well, you do sound a little bitter.  Why don't you take a breath here for a second?  Hey, listen.  Did you see the tape we're talking about here this morning?  Did you see the tape?  Why don't you go fucking shove your fist up your ass and jerk off on your fat wife,  you fucking scumbag.  Now he's just...  He's still not talking about me.  Somehow I'm thinking this isn't a productive conversation.  No, no.  I don't see this as being productive. 
[02:17:30]  Jesus Christ.  Get rid of this asshole, will you?  All right.  We got some intelligence here.  Jeremy in New York.  Jeremy.  Oh, Ron the lawyer is a cunt.  Oh, stop.  How about some serious calls here?  Serious calls only.  Let's go to Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, Fred from Brooklyn.  What's up, brother?  I just love hearing a real guy not talking legalese.  The guy is a straight shooter. 
[02:18:00]  The lawyer is standing up for what he thinks is right, and he's saying it in real words,  not legalese, and you've got to pat him on the back for that.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I think he got a lot of...  I like this guy.  He's got chutzpah.  I think he got a lot of fans, Ron.  I wish he was my divorce lawyer.  That's for sure.  That would have worked out well.  You don't talk like that in court, I hope.  Your Honor, do you really believe this cunt did what that said she did?  You know, the fact is, I do have a few contempt convictions and a few reprimands, but of course 
[02:18:30]  you do, but they were all baseless.  Of course.  You're Jeffrey Tambor in Justice for All.  But how do you two know each other, Ron and the father there, Tom?  You guys go way back?  We go way back.  We go way back.  Fraternity brothers?  What is it?  No, Tom and I actually worked together for about eight years back in the 80s.  Wow.  There you go.  What went wrong?  He decided he had a way to make more money.  Oh, shit. 
[02:19:00]  And left you behind, right?  Left me behind.  Goddamn gutter.  Objection, Your Honor.  Objection overruled.  Well, aren't you an asshole?  Oh, my God.  Probably has to judge what they do for a living.  What do you do, pal?  You look stupid in that faggity brother.  These guys are doing a lot of media today, and I'm assuming it's a little different when  you're on Fox News and all that, right?  Probably.  Just a little different.  Just blown off steam.  That's it.  We have another call for Ron.  I mean, for either one of these guys. 
[02:19:30]  I mean, Pat, you're okay?  Yeah, you're well represented.  Congratulations on this massive lawsuit you're going to win down the road.  All right.  Yeah.  Lotto.  Good job, character.  Hopefully.  Let's go to Derek in Iowa.  Derek.  Hey, morning, boys.  D-boy.  Hey.  Hey, Ron keeps mentioning a rogue cop.  I just thought, why don't you guys just ask Bob Kelly what this cop was thinking,  since he's another rogue cop.  Yeah, Bobby knows a lot about rogue cops.  Yeah, Ron, I'm a rogue cop, too.  He plays on TV.  Really?  Well, not yet, but it's coming. 
[02:20:00]  Well, hey, let me straighten in on something.  This may have been a rogue cop.  I can't clearly say this is a rogue cop.  I'm not saying it's a cop who has to actually have better control over his self-discipline  and understand how to handle something on the level of a tailgate party.  I mean, come on.  That's all we're really talking about here.  You know, I'm not talking about a cop who shot somebody.  I'm not talking about a cop who beat the shit out of somebody like a Rodney King.  I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about somebody who just needs a little understanding about how to handle crowd control 
[02:20:30]  at a tailgate party before a championship AFC game.  That's all I'm talking about here.  Do you want to see this cop fired, Ron?  No, not necessarily.  I'd just like to see, I'd like to see, as I say, retrained.  I'd like to see somebody talk to him.  I'd like to see him trained so that he doesn't think he can just grab a kid in a Jets jersey  because he's in a bad mood.  Maybe he's an avid Colts fan.  He gets carried away, and he starts thinking it's okay to slam a kid against the car,  put a taser against his head, and lock him up for eight hours.  You know, whether he's going to get fired or not, I'm not out messing with people's family lives, 
[02:21:00]  and I don't know anything about this guy.  He could be the nicest guy in the world under other circumstances.  Was he out of control that day?  Absolutely out of control.  And that's not a question of dispute.  There's no facts of dispute here because we got it on video.  You know, take a look at it.  Hey, tell me.  Ron, I've got to ask you one more question.  Now, they're saying that Pat was drunk and unruly, right?  Did they ever give you a breathalyzer or a blood test or any of that to prove that you were drunk?  I didn't ask any question.  It was just immediately.  Wow.  How did they give you public intoxication if they don't? 
[02:21:30]  I don't know.  They were making shit up.  Breathalyizing.  Were they nice to you while you were in jail after it was all over?  The guards were all really nice to you, yeah.  Do they have a TV so you could at least watch?  Yeah, but it was hard sometimes to watch.  I had to do all this other processing.  Oh, too busy making sure you weren't raped, right?  Oh, God.  No, no.  It was pretty relaxing here except for when you were raped.  You get raped for six hours in jail.  Hey, man.  If you're in a cell, you never fucking know who else is in there.  It's not the Oz.  Right?  Ron understands.  Ron knows.  Well, Ron, what about the San Diego incident? 
[02:22:00]  Ron was worried about his safety while he was in jail.  There was a San Diego incident that I was informed about where a Jets fan was arrested for just  cheering among the fans.  I saw the video.  What is that about?  Yes.  You know, I don't know what that's all about.  I haven't heard that.  I haven't heard about that.  Okay.  That might be a good...  Maybe there is something about Jets fans.  We'll look into that.  That was a week earlier at the championship game in San Diego.  Okay.  Yeah.  He just saw that.  I hadn't heard about that.  Yeah.  That was on YouTube also.  Adam in Brooklyn.  A lot of Brooklyn calls today.  Adam.  How are you doing, boys?  I got a question for Ron, the lawyer. 
[02:22:30]  Have you ever been thrown out of court before for saying objection jerk off or calling the  judge a jerk off or something?  Well, I've been convicted of contempt in court, but never for calling the judge a jerk off.  I mean, there are times when I have felt like calling judges jerk offs because, to be quite  Frank, you know, there are those judges who one could, you know, reasonably describe,  you know, with that terminology.  But, frankly, no, that hasn't happened to me because, you know, we all have to control  ourselves in certain forms because, you know, we all got to serve somebody. 
[02:23:00]  That's what I do for a living.  So, I can't go calling people jerk offs because I just disagree with them.  This is a different situation.  He knows in this forum, right?  He can express himself in a different way.  What you're hearing today is my reaction to seeing a young kid.  Now, somebody objected to my calling him a young kid because he's 26 years old, but I've  known him since he was two years old.  And watching a kid who I know has never had a problem in his life, who's not a drunk,  who wasn't drinking much.  I looked at the video a dozen times and I saw a kid being slammed against a car. 
[02:23:30]  I saw a kid come next to being tasered.  I saw a taser pressed against his head.  I saw the look on the cop's face, which was vicious, as he looked like he couldn't wait to  put that taser in action if this kid moved another inch, watched him thrown in the back  of a car, locked up for eight hours.  Come on.  That's what you're hearing today.  You're not hearing disrespect towards all authority.  You're not hearing disrespect toward judges.  You know, you're hearing my reaction to something that's a real injustice, and I want to discourage  people from behaving like that again.  That's all you're hearing now.  I want to sue because we miss out on another good YouTube tasering. 
[02:24:00]  Boy, you'd have been a big hit and everything, but boy, if you would have hit the deck,  that would have been a good one.  You should have taken one for the team, man.  For everyone else.  We love laughing at those videos.  It's like, I didn't do anything.  I'm not putting my hands behind my eyes.  I'll do anything.  Whatever.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's go to Brian.  Don't tase me, bro.  These guys are from Freehold, and we got Brian on the line from Freehold as well.  Brian.  Good evening.  Hello. 
[02:24:30]  Hi.  I'm an attorney.  I know these guys, not personally, but their reputations, Tommy Mallon and Ron Sage, are stellar.  And they're well-liked by cops, and they're well-liked by the bar, and I mean, I wish  I had the case, Ron.  But there's no way this kid did anything wrong.  I saw the video already, and this is really, sometimes you get cops that do the wrong thing,  and that's all there is to it.  Thanks, brother.  I'm not just going to, you know, blindly.  All right.  We're losing you. 
[02:25:00]  Mike in Orlando.  Mike.  I'm wrapping up with these guys, but everyone wants us.  Mike?  Hey, I just wanted to know, Ron there, once these tapes of the show were revealed, what  an ass you are, do you think of your future as a Wayne Newton impersonator?  Ooh.  I hear it a little bit.  A little Wayne Newton.  Quite the queerish Wayne Newton.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, man.  You must have the wrong number, asshole.  No, no.  I have the right number, asshole.  Oh. 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  You got anything else to say?  Did you see the tape here, son?  Did you see the tape?  Well, I don't need to see the tape to know that you're an asshole.  Okay.  But did you see the tape of the incident?  Did you see the tape of the incident, or do you just want to call in because your wife  wouldn't suck your dick this morning?  Oh!  I wonder why you don't work with Ron anymore.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Is that the problem, pal?  You couldn't get it up this morning, so now you're going to take it out to people on  the phone you haven't seen or heard from, haven't even seen a tape, don't know what 
[02:26:00]  the hell you're talking about.  Huh?  What is it, pal?  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Go see a good urologist.  Now, shut the fuck up.  I'm free with you.  I don't like the fact that people are giving Ron a hard time.  I know.  The fact that he sounds like Gomez Adams when he talks should not affect people who don't  call.  I'm loving him.  All right.  And, uh...  No surprise why Tom decided to go out on his own. 
[02:26:30]  I know.  It was safer that way, right, Tom?  Tom is saying they have to wrap up shortly, I guess, because they have to lose.  Well, he doesn't want Ron to blow the case.  Well, look, man.  I don't know.  I don't know what we accomplished.  I know we did some fun radio for everybody.  We got, uh...  I met my new lawyer.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I need a card.  Yeah, no, we got their side of the story out, obviously, and, uh...  You know, I was a little more on the cop's side before you came in, to tell you the truth.  I thought you were pulling away a little too much and resisting, but, uh, listening to 
[02:27:00]  your side and laughing my ass off at your lawyer, I've, uh, I've turned around a bit.  And after hearing the audio, the way the cop got out of the car, that was looking at the  confrontation.  That was, like, very...  Yeah, that was instant confrontation that he had on his mind.  So, uh...  No, great to have you guys in.  Thanks, uh...  Thanks for coming in.  To do a pisser.  To Ron the lawyer come back on our show someday?  Yeah, you know what I mean?  To talk about all the shit?  Lawyer segment.  If you're injured in an accident through no fault of your own, you need an attorney who  will fight for your rights.  To be convicted of contempt of court, but never for calling the judge a jerk-off. 
[02:27:30]  Call the law offices of Ron Sage today for your free, no-obligation consultation.  What do you do for a living, character?  Ron Sage is compassionate.  Get off the phone.  You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  Ron Sage is understanding.  Shut the fuck up and get off the phone, you stupid asshole.  You're completely wrong.  Ron Sage is on your side.  Is that the problem, pal?  You couldn't get it up this morning?  Now shut the fuck up.  I'm through with you.  Ron Sage is here for you.  You are an obvious asshole.  Hey, hey, hey, uh, have I still got you on the line? 
[02:28:00]  Are you still on the line here, pal?  For Sage legal advice, call Ron Sage today.  Come on.  How would you like that?  Justice is on your side.  So is Ron Sage.  Do you get, just do you get that?  Because if you don't get that, if you don't get that, then get the hell off the phone because  you're wasting my time.  People request one of the show.  The listener requests voicemail.  Next message.  This is Menzel Mark requesting the Stan Myers water car bit.  The one where they use the gun sound effect after every statement of Myers that would 
[02:28:30]  affect the oil companies.  It's the bit that made me an everyday listener.  It's the first bit I heard after hearing a promo on Raw Dog and I turned it 202 and this  is the bit that was on.  And just like that, I was hooked.  Thank God it wasn't a bobo day.  Well, I would definitely be deprived of my morning comedy.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Message deleted.  People request for a dub show.  This goes back to 1998.  The top of our news here at 6 o'clock. 
[02:29:00]  An age-old dream becoming a reality.  A local inventor has discovered a way, hear this, to use water to run your car.  It's a major breakthrough that will no doubt make motorists happy.  And as Ralph Robinson explains, the Pentagon is also showing lots of interest in this project.  Sure they are.  Where does this guy live?  That's the intro.  Hey, why don't you come in here and show us your little invention?  Yeah.  Drop a J-Dam into his house.  Just blow him up. 
[02:29:30]  Hey, I want to know what happened.  Hey, what happened?  CIA is very interested.  Yeah.  Well, this is 1998.  Oh, yeah.  Where are we at?  Where is this guy now?  Where is he at?  Where's the water power car?  He's in Guantanamo.  I'm not a terrorist, I swear.  We got to start.  Swear to God, I'll never invent anything ever again.  Oh, God.  It's not another toll.  I'll buy an Escalade.  Just let me out of here.  Let me leave with all my fingers. 
[02:30:00]  God.  I never said I had a problem with oil.  It was just a hobby.  Water's for drinking.  Water's for drinking.  Water's for drinking.  What are you going to do with that power slot?  Oh, God.  He has to write a thousand times, water's for drinking, gas is for driving.  Water's for drinking, gas is for driving.  What is that torture with the wet boarding?  What do I call it?  Oh, yeah.  Water boarding.  Is this what you want to put in your car?  It is. 
[02:30:30]  It works real good, doesn't it?  They pull him out of the drum.  Imagine if they did that in gas.  Oh, fuck.  Can you imagine getting soaked in gas?  That would be horrible.  Horrible.  That would suck.  And horrific.  Especially if they kept your eyes open with fucking things.  Oh, that would sting, I bet.  That would sting.  Sting.  That would hurt you.  All right, hey, we've got to start over, because I don't know how to work these CD players.  What happened if you got jerked off with gas?  Ouch.  This is a great contest.  Like, who could hold out the longest? 
[02:31:00]  Oh, all right, new contest that we can't do.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get a bunch of people.  They have to jerk off with nothing but gasoline.  How the fuck would that hurt?  What do you want to get you?  The pain or the fumes?  I mean, there's a whole bunch of things going on.  I think the fucking pain, because gas would offer zero lubrication.  I would for a second.  And so you'd chafe.  You'd start chafing, and once that happens, that gasoline.  And then the smell.  That gasoline smell. 
[02:31:30]  Smells like blue balls.  Chlorine.  Jerk it off with chemicals.  Why don't you figure out all the different things can you jerk off with?  Let's see.  Motor oil.  Motor oil.  Bleach.  Probably could with motor oil, but don't get any in the tip.  And come quick.  Jello.  Bleach?  No.  Beach sand?  That should be a contest.  The fucking wackiest thing you can jerk off in front of us with.  We got to start.  Yes.  What grain sandpaper? 
[02:32:00]  We got to start thinking.  You go up, too.  Yeah, that wet, dry sandpaper.  So it leaves a nice, shiny cock.  In case you didn't know what sandpaper was, I went like this, Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  You rubbed your fingers on your fist.  Can we go back to the news report, please?  Oh, I forgot.  Listen to the old school air, will we?  News guy with the latest invention.  The top R news here at 6 o'clock.  An age-old dream becoming a reality.  A local inventor has discovered a way, hear this, to use water.  Coming a reality.  Sure it is.  Well, the future says, try again. 
[02:32:30]  Let me drink some of my petroleum for the way home.  That newscaster was some of my fuel.  Here in the future, we say, no, it didn't happen.  Run your car.  It's a major breakthrough that will no doubt make motorists happy.  And as Ralph Robinson explains, the Pentagon is also showing lots of interest in this project.  Water has always been considered a precious commodity, but Stan Meyer's invention may make it even more valuable.  He has developed what's called a water fuel cell.  It has taken the place of his old gas tank. 
[02:33:00]  I was right behind you.  You got it?  Oh, Stan Meyer.  Danny's got some news on it.  I guarantee he's dead.  He died in a car accident.  And it's something very suspicious.  A heart attack, car accident.  Wait, wait, wait.  Danny, you have the answer?  All right, hold on.  Let's try.  Let's try.  Hold on.  Hold on.  This guy is so dead.  It's not even funny.  So dead.  So fucking dead.  Not even just dead.  He's so dead.  Okay.  Someone bought the patent.  Nothing ever happened.  And he had a heart attack.  I'm going to say that something weird in his past suddenly came up.  They don't even need to kill you anymore.  I'm going to say a knife fight in a bar. 
[02:33:30]  No, I think that Stan, he was fucking, uh...  Let me think.  This...  He disappeared.  No, it's got to be a car crash.  It just has to be like they cut his brake lines.  He fell down the stairs and his family wondered why he had handcuffs on his hands and feet.  They did the kiddie porn thing to him.  They switched his hard drive.  That's what they did.  A character assassination.  That's what they usually go with.  Two inventors.  Died in prison? 
[02:34:00]  Danny, what do we got on Stan?  Well, uh...  Mr. Meyer was mysteriously poisoned.  Holy shit!  Get the fuck out of here!  No, he wasn't!  And the poison, uh...  Caused an aneurysm in his brain.  And he died leaving a restaurant.  Wow.  See?  A theory.  Oh, man, Bill.  Bullshit.  I'm with you.  I'm so with you on this one, Bill.  I'm fucking telling you!  Don't fuck with the government.  That's not the government.  It's the oil companies who...  They're more powerful.  Yeah, they're... 
[02:34:30]  They were...  Yeah.  Wow.  They fucking got him.  Yeah.  They got him.  Wow.  And what happened to his big fucking...  Well, the brother of Stan claims that, I think, like a week or two after his death,  people broke into where he had this water-powered dune bucky and just stole it for the pieces  and he doesn't know what happened to it.  Oh, come on!  And his brother's too stupid.  Like, you know, talent like that probably is just one person.  Yeah, it was just him.  One guy. 
[02:35:00]  One guy.  He watches SportsCenter, right?  He doesn't give a fuck, right?  Oh, he had a water-powered car.  You didn't see that?  Like, that guy, you ever...  Like, you go on there and you see, like, some of the inventions that were just suppressed  and then they used to just always say that the person was crazy, like that guy Tesla,  right out there.  Yeah, Tesla's a lunatic.  Like, all this wireless technology.  He came up with this shit, I guess, in the 1800s and you could actually, you just...  There was these big, ugly things, but you'd put it in and he somehow tapped in the electricity  or whatever and you could...  Everyone could have had it for free and then they... 
[02:35:30]  Like Wi-Fi electricity.  Yeah, and then they just went up and, eh, that's real interesting.  Eh, put him in a fucking headlock, you know?  He's crazy.  He's talking about force fields and aliens.  He's out of his fucking mind and they just totally destroyed him as a human being and  like 150 years later...  And Edison was their guy.  Hey, Thomas Edison, wires, goes to a power station, you pay for it.  And it is all bullshit.  I was in my apartment in L.A.  I was getting free internet, right?  And then out of nowhere, all of a sudden, I wasn't getting it.  So then I had to pay for the shit. 
[02:36:00]  So then the guy shows up and he puts it on and he goes, uh...  He goes, all right, I need to adjust this.  I'm like, what's the matter?  I'm getting a good signal.  He goes, yeah, but it's too strong.  It's too strong.  So he doesn't want anybody else to steal it.  Oh, right.  Gotcha.  I don't think it's that big a fucking deal.  We're just all...  Like, they don't teach you anything.  What do they teach you?  They teach you how to...  They teach you how to be a fucking drone that goes and sits in a cubicle.  And I got my one-week vacation coming up.  That's what they want you.  The last thing they want you to be down in the cellar, like that fucking guy in Back to 
[02:36:30]  the Future, trying to come up with shit.  Because they're going to whack you.  That's what happens.  Dr. Brown?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, everything starts tasting like almonds.  You just fall over.  You smell burning hair.  Let's go back to the...  That's it.  Let's go back to the news story from 1998.  More on Stan Meyer.  Yeah.  It has taken the place of his old gas tank.  The water fuel cell breaks down water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen.  The hydrogen is used to run his dune buggy.  I don't care if you use rainwater, well water, city water, ocean water. 
[02:37:00]  If you don't have any fresh water, go ahead and use snow.  If you don't have any snow available to you, they use salt water because there's no adverse  effect to the fuel cell.  And the oil company said, here's some poison water.  Yeah.  Here he goes.  Water, sir.  And the Pentagon is interesting.  You know there's some guy in there like that fucking like De Niro's Al Capone?  I want him dead.  I want his house burned down.  I want that fucking buggy hair in 10 minutes.  I want him pissing on his fucking asses.  Hey, shit.  Dude, it's this way. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  You know what kills me is it's so fucking...  That's bad.  It's so fucking obvious.  It's just like...  That really is.  And you know I would sit here and argue with Bill Burr about this.  This one's too good.  And go, this is bullshit.  I can't believe they killed him.  I am so with you here.  I thought that they were just going to go to destroy his couch.  How did they kill him?  Not only did they kill him, we knew that he was dead.  Had to be dead.  I'd never heard of this guy before.  Anyone else?  I can't believe it.  I see a part of this story. 
[02:38:00]  Myers started working on this project four years ago.  He's not a scientist.  He isn't even a chemist.  In fact, he never graduated from college.  Myers was determined, he says, to design something to protect this country from oil embargoes.  And we have calculated that if we take the dune buggy from Los Angeles to New York, we  would roughly use 22 gallons of water.  The Pentagon flew a lieutenant colonel in last week to look at Myers' invention.  There's talk of possibly using it in the Star Wars defense program and to run army tanks.  Myers is currently perfecting a water fuel cell for cars. 
[02:38:30]  It will cost about $1,500.  He says it won't need any maintenance and you won't have to replace it.  It will be at least two years before the fuel system goes into mass production.  The day it happens will be one that fuel industry hates, but it will put a smile on the face  of those who've had to say at one time or another, fill her up.  This is a fill her up, all right?  He just rewrote his death sentence right there.  Oh, that was it.  God, not knowing he's dead, it's so obvious.  They flew in a colonel, a lieutenant colonel has flown in and it's like that Brady Bunch episode 
[02:39:00]  when they said the UFO.  No, this has got to be older than 98 because they said the Star Wars defense.  This has got to be older than 98.  Oh, there you go.  It's a UFO.  No, it's swamp gas.  Everything I found referenced in 1998.  Wow, okay.  Wow.  That is amazing.  He basically came up with a way to make the people who are making the most money in this  country to go broke.  Broke.  I've discovered a way to fuck over the Illuminati. 
[02:39:30]  Come on over to my house.  That's it.  You're done.  You're fucking done.  And there's no way, you couldn't just prevent people from grabbing a bucket of water from  somewhere, you know?  So they can't capitalize it.  The oil companies can't go, okay, now we're the water company.  The number one way to control people is if you control the energy.  They figured it out years ago, centuries ago.  We need it.  Wow.  Yeah.  So they got everybody. 
[02:40:00]  So if this guy, you know, it's just like, hey, you want to go to Connecticut?  I got a bottle of water here, huh?  Yeah, it's nothing.  And then he would say, it's going to be a day, you know, bad day for the oil companies, but  a good day for people that want to say, fill her up.  But before that day, there's going to be a bad day for Stan.  It's going to start with the...  Shooting a little dart into his neck from across the fucking room.  It's going to start with liquid diarrhea and end with death.  I'm surprised they didn't take out his brother, too.  Yeah.  That's the kind of thing.  They probably really...  He must have been some kind of Billy Carter moron motherfucker that they just figured 
[02:40:30]  there's no chance.  He's retarded.  Just give him some pennies to play with.  All those guys.  I used to be a bit in my act about that shit.  We used to...  You'd see these guys in the news.  They'd figure out how to make their truck run on, like, ketchup or something.  And they'd always show it, and then you'd just never see the guy again.  Never hear about him anymore.  The companies are really looking into this, taking a strong interest.  So what's the weather going to be like this weekend?  And it just goes away.  End of story.  That guy's at, like, a fat burger, like, six months later, all of a sudden, just clutching 
[02:41:00]  his chest.  He just falls over.  That motherfucker was just like, and it's going to cost next to nothing.  It never has to be replaced.  And good news, a colonel's being flown in.  LA and New York on a fucking thimble of water, and a lieutenant colonel and an assassin are  being flown in from the Pentagon.  He said everything wrong.  Everything.  Wait, you want to...  Let's hear that again.  I got to hear the end of that.  Dude, that meant every time it rained.  You just put a bucket outside, and you can drive to Wyoming. 
[02:41:30]  Do whatever you want.  Run your house.  Just because it runs a car doesn't mean it can't create energy to heat your house and  run anything.  Dude, I'm going to tell you, and that's why we are headed towards disaster, because the  only way to ever make any of this shit change is there's going to be blood spilled like you've  never seen.  I'm telling you, man.  I can't fucking wait.  I can't wait.  Well, Jesus Christ, you're loaded for bear, man.  You're ready for it.  I am waiting for...  I don't care what kind of war it is. 
[02:42:00]  Put whatever word in front.  Oil.  Race.  Well, that's about the only two.  Why don't we...  Get the bell ready.  Ring the bell every time this stand says something.  That got the Pentagon's ear?  Yeah, yeah.  Right, exactly.  Exactly.  Here we go.  I don't think...  Hold on.  Hold on.  What?  What, do you got something better?  I think that bell's going to break.  I don't think we should have the bell.  I think the bell's going to break by the time you get to the end of this.  How about whammy sounds?  No, I think I got...  Dan, how did you find that, man? 
[02:42:30]  That's great.  This clip was just floating around the other day.  I just thought it was so funny.  You know, because obviously, you know, I was laughing at the same thing that you guys  are now, so...  You got something good?  What is it?  Yeah.  Let me hear it.  All right, this will happen every time.  And that's the assassin.  The assassin, like, practicing with a target of Stan.  Stupid Stan.  In the bowels of the Pentagon.  Here's that same story again.  Listen for all the things he probably shouldn't have said.  The top R news here at 6 o'clock.  An age-old dream becoming a reality. 
[02:43:00]  A local inventor has discovered a way, hear this, to use water to run your car.  It's a major breakthrough that will no doubt make motorists happy.  And as Ralph Robinson explains, the Pentagon is also showing lots of interest in this project.  Water has always been considered a precious commodity, but Stan Meyer's invention may make  it even more valuable.  He has developed what's called a water fuel cell.  It has taken the place of his old gas tank.  The water fuel cell breaks down water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen. 
[02:43:30]  The hydrogen is used to run his dune buggy.  I don't care if you use rainwater, well water, city water, ocean water.  If you don't have any fresh water, then go ahead and use snow.  If you don't have any snow available to you, then use salt water because there's no adverse  effect to the fuel cell.  And if you're really desperate, empty the ice cube tray.  Anything.  Spit in it.  He'll take you to fucking Florida.  Or lay a bunch of cactuses out and put plastic in a lot of them.  Make it longer! 
[02:44:00]  Holy Jesus.  I'm kidding.  So dead.  Can you come up with another way where you could even, I'm trying to, how can you top  air, oxygen, getting killed that quickly?  That is the worst thing he could have said.  The only people that weren't impressed were people that lived in like New Mexico and Arizona.  Holy shit.  He fucked up so badly.  So dead.  He just, just go to a mosque in the Middle East and just yell, fuck Allah. 
[02:44:30]  And you'll live, you'll live longer.  That's pretty much it.  His invention would basically collapse our economy is basically what would happen.  He would be driving to no jobs.  Right.  Or anything.  Yeah, but the amazing thing is that invention, as long as it continued to rain, we could still  drive around bitching about the economy.  They would just build a fucking roof over the United States and collect, yeah, a weather  machine.  All right, now we've got to break out our fucking weather machine we've had for years. 
[02:45:00]  We knew we would need this eventually.  Dude, and you know, he just gave them all the information they wanted, because he probably  viewed them, oh, this is the United States government.  I feel important.  This is great.  Give it over.  Give it his only blueprint.  His only copy of his blueprint.  What's his fucking name?  Stan Myers.  Yeah.  Or my name.  Mr. Myers.  He says, hi, yeah.  You think we could meet tonight for dinner?  Okay, great.  Yeah, yeah.  It's Lieutenant Colonel Smith.  Yeah, we'll meet tonight for dinner. 
[02:45:30]  Look, don't tell anyone about this.  Your family or anyone.  Yeah.  Just show up alone.  Can you take a taxi and not your own car?  And how many copies of the blueprints do you have?  Yeah, you've got the blueprints and the keys to where you keep the dune buggy.  It's really fascinating.  Yeah, we're fascinated with it.  You're a great American.  All right, here's the second half.  You ready?  Oh, of course.  Everything he said that maybe he could have said, you'll hear the gunshot.  Myers started working on this project four years ago. 
[02:46:00]  He's not a scientist.  He isn't even a chemist.  In fact, he never graduated from college.  Myers was determined, he says, to design something to protect this country from oil embargoes.  And we have calculated that if we take the dune buggy from Los Angeles to New York,  we would roughly use 22 gallons of water.

The day it happens will be one the fuel industry hates.  It'll put a smile on the face of those who've had to say at one time or another, fill her up.  Wow.  $1,500.  $1,500.  A drop in the bucket, quite literally.  22 gallons.  What's a gallon of water cost?  $3,000.  $2,000.  They'll find a way to get AIDS into most of the water. 
[02:47:00]  Times 22, we had to put AIDS in the water.  You could have driven across the country for about $30.  And you use up the hydrogen and all that exhausts out, I guess, is oxygen.  And it's clean.  It's completely clean.  And it's funny you say how much does water cost.  When this story came out, water was still very much free.  Sounds like a bunch of fat cats out there.  Wow.  Yeah.  That guy committed suicide by knowledge.  Well, you know.  That's what it was. 
[02:47:30]  The listener requests voicemail.  Next message.  This is Matt from Illinois.  I'm a first-time caller, so I'm a bit of a nervous nelly here, but here goes.  I want to request the bit from a few years back where Jimmy describes a scenario in which Bill O'Reilly's grandma is being gangbanged by the Harlem Globetrotters.  Now, this all started after Bill O'Reilly visited a black-owned restaurant in Harlem, I believe, and his comments were a long line, but he couldn't believe how well they spoke. 
[02:48:00]  Now, this got Jimmy pondering why Bill O'Reilly, you know, just will appear to hear this request pretty soon.  Bye-bye.  Message deleted.  You know, I was up in Harlem a few weeks ago, and I actually had dinner with Al Sharpton, who is a very, very interesting guy. 
[02:48:30]  He comes on to Factor a lot, and then I treated him to dinner because he's made himself available to us, and I felt that I wanted to take him up there, and we went to Sylvia's, a very famous restaurant in Harlem.  So, I had a great time, and all people up there were tremendously respectful, they all watched the Factor, you know, and Sharpton, I walked in, it was like big commotion and everything, but everybody was very nice.  And I couldn't get over the fact that there was no difference between Sylvia's restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City.  I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship, it was the same. 
[02:49:00]  And that's really what the society is all about now here in the USA.  There's no difference.  There's no difference.  There wasn't one person in Sylvia's who was screaming, MF-er, I want more iced tea.  I, in my naiveness, always, I thought like ass-fucking was like a new invention.  Oh, really?  You just like, you don't want to think that, like your grandma or anyone that's old in your life was like doing the same shit you were doing, you know what I mean? 
[02:49:30]  Getting it up the ass!  Like feeding bananas to your hungry cunt.  I thought that was more of an invention of the 90s, you know?  You're not greedy, huh?  Right.  Huh?  Huh?  They romanticize this shit when you watch old movies and stuff.  Yeah.  That's, uh, wow.  All the way May took it up the ass after every win.  A lot of people lingering longer with, all right, all the way May. 
[02:50:00]  All the way May.  As she slid into home plate, some Negro was holding a baseball bat.  She took it all in her hungry cunt.  And a young Bill O'Reilly walked in while Grandmama was being shish kebabed by two black cops the size of the Chrysler building.  Grandmama, what are you doing?  Get out of here, you little meddler.  I've got two dark seed pumpers in my mouth and asshole.  You'll learn about this someday when you dine in Harlem. 
[02:50:30]  They can't vote, but boy, can they fuck.  Say goodnight, Gracie.  And then he's shit in my mouth, you silly goose.  Hey, the young O'Reilly sitting there watching his granny.  I take the cock all the way down to those plum-like balls.  That's right, Bill.  It's called melanin.  And you don't have it.  Which would explain you a little dingle.  But boy, can they give a gal a deep dicking?  Here's an apple. 
[02:51:00]  Don't tell your grandfather.  He's so surprised the cum is white.  That's right.  It's the seed of the devil.  He's pumping it into me.  But I only take it in the shitter because we don't have abortions.  That's right.  He's got the black power fist in my hungry cunt.  You six-foot-eight loofus sponge using fraud, cocksucker, hypocrite jizz bucket. 
[02:51:30]  You're three years old and you're six-foot-eight.  And grandmama has got a black cock on her cheek and one in her asshole and one in each hand.  That's right.  I have the Harlem Globetrotters.  Curly Neal just shit my pussy.  And we're off. 
[02:52:00]  Metalock Lemon ripped my cunt.  That's right.  At first they send in the white incompetent team and they all try to fuck me but their dicks are like spaghetti.  And the Globetrotters come in and he threw his cock at me and it snapped right back into his hand.  It was a trick cock.  I remember sitting in the audience when the negro came toward me with a big bucket and threw it at me.  I thought it was confetti but it was gum.  And I caught it all in my mouth, young Bill. 
[02:52:30]  You six-foot-eight conservative loofus sponge big cocked little fella.  That's right.  Grandma's got a pussy full of sickle cell.  What are you thinking of them apples?  You'll be talking about this someday on Fox News, won't you?  You're surprised they eat like us.  You ought to see how they fuck, young Bill.  They're making a nana hammock.  One in the mouth, one in the shitter, and nana swings.  When they meet in the middle somewhere near the liver. 
[02:53:00]  They fill up nana like a cannoli.  Your grandfather dresses like Oscar did all the way up.  And hasn't fucked nana in quite a long time, Bill.  Cuck holes.  Hey, Florida Steve, I gotta read this.  Metal Ark Lemons just gave me a shit.  What's that?  Metal Ark Lemons just gave me a shit hat. 
[02:53:30]  A shit hat, darling.  It looks like the one nana wears on Sunday, but there's no flower in it.  A shit hat covering my eye socket.  I'll tell you that I'm afraid of blacks, but I'm only afraid that when they walk in,  I'm going to kneel and suck their cock so hard that their ears cave in.  That's right, young Bill. 
[02:54:00]  Nana likes her black cock in her mouth.  What do you think of them apples, you Republican?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, why don't you...  Good point, Scott, from Chicago.  What about a little sweet Georgia Brown if we're going to do the Globetrotters?  Oh, yeah.  That'll bring the whole bit home, you know what I'm saying?  Bill, did you bring home those bananas for Nana?  You know what a three-pointer is?  Nana's a three-pointer.  I've got one in the mouth, pussy, and ass.  That's a three-pointer.  I'm a five-pointer if it's one for each hand, young Bill. 
[02:54:30]  Be careful, I'll get black cum all over my charm bracelet.  Don't tell your grandfather.  I've got more black semen in my mouth than the African Navy.  Keep it down, Bill.  You'll talk about this on Fox someday.  That's right.  I'm doing a female rip-off voice of Anthony's 1940s guy.  Whatever works.  I changed gender and I added cunt.  It's a different person.  Matt from St. Louis.  I like to make werewolf cunt movies. 
[02:55:00]  I don't like the A train  I like the N train  Now you go play, Bill  Nana's taping  Oh, I don't know  Nana got nervous  Nana got nervous  They wait outside my door  Like it's the unemployment line  I tell them there's a little  Government cheese in my womb  And they dive in head first  Oh, don't bother Nana 
[02:55:30]  When she's getting a deep dicking, Bill  Your grandfather, since the war  Hasn't been able to get it up  You 6'9", 4-year-old  With a big cock, apparently  According to the transcripts  Poor Nana  She loved it  Oh, boy, she couldn't get enough 
[02:56:00]  Didn't get enough  The listener requests voicemail  Next message  Yes, this is Celine Dion  And my web address  Intranet  Service connection is  www.celeinedion.com  Internet  Phase 3  Dash 791402  And  I think that's my web address  Also, thank you very much

[02:59:30]  That I'm as devastated  As the rest of the world  Devastated  If I may  I was watching  You behind  There's a television  Right now  I'm watching  And I'm especially waiting  Like the rest of the world  I'm waking up in the morning  I'm having a coffee  I barely can swallow it  Yeah through your  Little pigeon neck  She sounds like  Christopher Walken  Oh  I can barely swallow it  I can barely  I can barely swallow it  And she's in one of those  Ridiculous suites 
[03:00:00]  In Las Vegas  You know  From my  Huge  38 inch  Plasma television  Right  I could not  Take the pain  And anguish  Of those people  As I looked down  On Las Vegas  From my penthouse suite  Why couldn't you swallow  The coffee  Was her husband  Using her mouth  To practice rolling  Dyson  Well we've heard  He's got a problem  What can I tell you  We all have problems  Yeah  And I'm especially waiting  Like the rest of the world  I'm waking up in the morning  I'm having a coffee  I barely can swallow it 
[03:00:30]  I come here  At Caesars Palace  Every night  To perform  Uh oh  I barely can sing  Yeah well  But for respect  For the people who come  I am still singing  When I come home at night  My son is waiting for me  I watch television  Yes we gave a million dollar  Like what we expect  What I want to look  Like the rest of the world  I open the television  There's feet 
[03:01:00]  How do you open a television  I open the television  Opie I don't think  We should make fun of this  She's still saying  While those people suffered  She's brave  She is brave  She's a brave girl  We gave a million dollar  I have a coffee  We  I don't know what plural is  Yeah  How about buying an S  You foreign whore  Watch television  Yes we gave a million dollar  But what we expect 
[03:01:30]  What I want to look  Like the rest of the world  I open the television  See it was a dollar  And she just wrote  A million on it  A million dollar  It was a million dollar  And I open the television  And I see wires and tubes  And I don't know what year it is  Because there's never tubes  In TVs anymore  You idiot  I open television  What  But what we expect  What I want to look  Like the rest of the world  I open the television  There's people still there  Waiting to be rescued 
[03:02:00]  And for me  It's not acceptable  I know  There's reasons for it  I'm sorry to say  I'm being rude  But I don't want to hear  Those reasons  You know  Some people  They should fly her over  Fly her over  Like the flooded areas  Yeah  In a helicopter  And lower her down  And then she could sing  The Titanic song  Wouldn't that be great  As they're hanging on  To their roofs  Hold on Tyrone  Tyrone  Don't let go  Don't ever let go  Tyrone  If only there was room enough 
[03:02:30]  For you on that door  That your girlfriend  Is on right now  It could be a huge  Cavernous door  And there still wouldn't be room  Have you seen the women down there  Big fat asses  You are a survivor  Many people perished  Under the brown sewage  Of New Orleans  Much like they did  That fateful night  On 
[03:03:00]  In April  Of 19  18?  12?  12?  14?  19  12  It was 12  Shut up  Alright  Sorry  Much like they perished  In the icy waters  Of the North Atlantic  On that fateful  Maiden voyage  Of Titanic  But some of them  Were  Survivors  And Larry I watch 
[03:03:30]  I watch and personally  I don't care  But I cry  I cry because my husband  Is 90 fucking years old  I cry when I think  He touched me  When I was 14  Forced me to marry him  That is why I weep today  You think I really care 
[03:04:00]  About the shwoogies  Larry  How many bodies lie there  Beneath that mucky brown  Stinky mess  I say pee you Larry  And some of them  Cling to their rooftops  Like  Many clung  To life jackets  And pieces of wood  On that fateful night 
[03:04:30]  On the  Panic  They are truly  Truly  Negroes  They are so poor  And so black  All right  Back to the audio  Jesus  That was fantastic  Oh stop it  Back to Celine  Mark crying Celine  And for me it's not acceptable  I know  There's reasons for it  I'm sorry to say  I'm being rude  But I don't want to hear 
[03:05:00]  Those reasons  You know  Some people are stealing  And they're making a big deal  Out of it  Oh they're stealing  20 pair of jeans  Or they're stealing television sets  Who cares  They're not going to go too far with it  Maybe those people are so poor  Some of the people who do that  They're so poor  They've never touched anything in their lives  Let them touch those things for once  Invite them into your house  Let them touch  You also have never touched a seat  At your show  At Caesars  You fucking overpriced Canadian hosebag 
[03:05:30]  But you never touched an orchestra seat there  Did they  Oh my god  Let them touch stuff  Let them just touch it  That's the biggest cock tease ever  Here  Feel this plasma TV  That you'll never have  What racist she is  Holy shit  Just touch it  Just touch it  Because that will make you feel better  Unfortunately  They were touching guns at Walmarts  And touching the triggers  Stop it  I was inspired  When they taught Coco to sign  She did not say 
[03:06:00]  Let the people touch  Just touch it  Just touch it  Oh my goodness  The people who do that  They're so poor  They've never touched anything in their lives  Let them touch those things for once  The main thing right now  It's not the people who are stealing  It's the people who are left there  And they're watching helicopters flying over their heads  Helicopters  And they're praying  How come it's so easy  To send planes 
[03:06:30]  In another country  To kill everyone in a second  To destroy lives  We need to serve our country  And for me to serve our country  Is to be there right now  To rescue the rest of the people  We need the cash  We need the blood  We need the support  Right now we need the prayers  Jesus  Where's Larry through that hole  Jesus  I was nodding off  She has the foreign policy inside of a six year old  How do we send bombs to block their world and the universe 
[03:07:00]  In seconds  In seconds  Everything  I can't get over the fact  Let them touch things  Just touch it  Much like the poor passengers  That were stuck in steerage on the Titanic  We should just pull gates shut  And lock them  To drown in their basements  Look Tyrone  You'll never have an iPod  But hey  Feel free to touch it  I want to touch it  Right  Oh  Oh is that the best?  What a mess she is 
[03:07:30]  She continued on Larry King last week  It is  You know  When I was hearing a couple of days ago  That these things are not reachable  It's too full of water  Maybe I'm too much like  I'm not thinking with my head  I'm talking with my heart  Nobody can open any roofs  The helicopter is flying in  Take two people at a time  Take a kayak  Go into those walls  Take a kayak?  A kayak?  Oh she's an outdoorsy one  Or take a limo 
[03:08:00]  Like I do  To go to my shoes  Why?  Why can't they take the flying Steve car  And please pick up these people  Take a kayak?  Oh  It is so easy  If Steve would  Just there he is now  Just fly by Steve  Land and pick these people up  In your flying hybrid car  The helicopter is flying in  Take two people at a time  Take a kayak  Go into those walls 
[03:08:30]  What?  There's  What?  Kids being ready  You can't take a kayak  Through walls  Take a kayak through those walls?  What does she say?  She watches Gilligan's Island too much  You think that's how they get around?  A kayak?  Jesus  This isn't I Dream of Jeannie  Is Jim leaving a permanent thing?  No  Stop it  Stop it  Still a big part of the show  And he'll be coming back and forth  And doing this and doing that  Don't you worry 
[03:09:00]  There's  Kids being raped at night  We hear gunshots  Big guns  What's that?  Those people are playing  They're walking  They're like this  Hello  Do you see us?  We're still alive  But we're dying  It's terrible  I do not want to talk to you about money  What?  Holy crap  Will you just shut up and sing your stupid song?  She lost her fucking mind  And it's fantastic  We can't see them at night 
[03:09:30]  Because they're dark  Until they smile  We see teeth  We think they're floating dentures  But there are people attached to those  Oh is she an ass?  I thought somebody dropped a big package of ping pong balls  And I was looking  But it was humans looking up at me  I thought it was ping pong balls and chiclets  But it wasn't Larry  It was people  Wow 
[03:10:00]  Wow  Wow  Wow  Wow  Let's say hi to Carl in New Jersey  Carl  Hey she sounds like Mr. Wett  Do you remember Mr. Wett?  Mr. Wett  Yeah  There was two radio DJs  They had a show back in the day  I forget their names  It was a big fat guy  You and Anthony referenced them all the time  Once in a while back in the day  And she was like  Mr. Wett  I'm from the sewer  I live under the ground  Hey Mr. Wett  Never ever ever  This guy is amazing 
[03:10:30]  I could have saved  I'm sorry Carl  I really don't know what you're talking about  Alright  Let's continue  Why are you taking the birthday cake out?  Huh?  Oh okay  Alright  More of Celine Dion  Of course  Please  I want this burnt  So I could listen to it on the way home  Of course  We're going to have Maury Povich in studio in a few minutes as well  So stay there  Where's Maury?  But first more Celine Dion  This is too good  Maury's going to have to wait a few minutes  We've been doing the show now for two and a half hours 
[03:11:00]  We've been asking a lot of people how they can help  How you can help  A lot of people all over the world want to help  You gave a million dollars  You're going to help a lot of people live and survive  You should take great pride in that  One that you've attained the ability to be able to do that  To be able to give a million dollars  You should take pride in that  I understand it's very important because eventually we will need that money  But it's just very frustrating that Franco and Conscious West and me 
[03:11:30]  Oh, we have one million dollar  This is one thing  In three months, in six months, they will need that money  Right now, they're praying for water  So we need to send them the water  They don't care about my check  No, they do  It's just frustrating because on our parts of the world  We're trying to our death and we're expecting those people  Oh, she don't shut up  Your check will turn into something  And I'm sending Welch's grape juice and garlic  Old 
[03:12:00]  Doddering old buffoon  Yeah, you know  I love Larry King's style where he pretty much doesn't do anything on his show  And lets the people talk  But sometimes, as a host, you've got to jump in there a little bit  Oh my god, is she upset? Shut up  Alright, here's the clip of clips  I know you've got to go on soon  But we couldn't spend any time with you without asking you  Do you have any kind of thing you would like to sing that fits this moment?  She's got a song for everything 
[03:12:30]  Thanks, Larry  She's got a song for everything  Is there any song in your  Even if you did a little of it  I don't want to  Well, the only song that comes to my mind right now  Is definitely a prayer  What's going on in Larry King's mind?  Do you think he knows she's just a lunatic at this point  And is exploiting that?  Yeah  Or is he dead serious about having Celine Dion sing a song for everybody? 
[03:13:00]  I think he's just trying to get as much out of her as he can  And at this point, having her do a song is the icing  You think so?  Is he being that calculating or is he just an out-of-touch ass?  That's what I'm wondering, you know  Sing a song  The Motley Crue  Because she's not in the right frame of mind to actually sing a song  Well, let's see how this plays out  It's definitely a prayer  I did sing that song a few years back with Andrea Bocelli 
[03:13:30]  And I cannot think about a song  About a prayer  I will do my very best  And I'll do my best  General's got her in their masses  I pray you'll be alright  And watch us where we go  This just in, Bruce Kelly's car  And help us to be wise 
[03:14:00]  In times when we don't know  Let this be our prayer  When we lose our way  Lead us to a place  Guide us with your grace  Liar, whore, liar, whore, you know it  The place where we'll be saved 
[03:14:30]  Shut your goddamn pie hole  I pray we'll find your life  You can get a doggy star  You can get a lady on your side  Those are your only choices  This is my house and I get to sing  When stars go out each night  Reminds us where you are  Let this be our prayer  Can't you talk  Can't you talk 
[03:15:00]  For a whore  Let us feel our days  Help us find a place  Guide us with your grace  Now choke yourself  Give us faith  Give us faith  So we'll be safe  Wow  No shit  Okay, terrific  And there you have it 
[03:15:30]  That's very dramatic  Wow  Celine Dion  Wow  Wow  Wow  Wow, she lost her mind  That's fantastic  Maybe those people are so poor  Some of the people who do that  They're so poor  They've never touched anything  In their life  Let them  Do those things for once  All together now  Let them  Touch those things 
[03:16:00]  Let them  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  Trust  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  Kayak!  Take, take a kayak! 
[03:16:30]  Let them touch those things!  Let them touch those things!  Let them touch those things!  For once!  Take, take a kayak!  Take, take a kayak!  What's up? 
[03:17:00]  What's up?  What's up?  The All Request First Off Show  First Off Show  I'm sure they do!  I enjoy the Grateful Dead show every once in a while!  Horrible!  And then you're like a newbie at the Dead concert and you just want to hear the hits!  Yeah, yeah!  Hey, when are they going to play Touch of Grey? 
[03:17:30]  That is their best song!  Dead fans love to hear that too!  Dead fans hate it!  No, they don't really!  They don't consider it dead!  It's called Beginner Dead!  Exactly!  There's a whole thing within the Dead community!  If you listen to that stuff, you're a beginner dead!  And they look at you like, oh that's kinda cute!  That was like when Charlie Daniels was big in the 70s and the Devil Went Down to Georgia  that came out!  And if you were a Charlie Daniels fan, that was it!  If anyone liked that song, they were assholes because they didn't appreciate Charlie Daniels 
[03:18:00]  before that!  I like that song!  Because the Devil wanted to get a soul, he couldn't get one, so he said, ah, let's have  a fiddle contest!  I'll fiddle ya for it!  Fiddle ya!  And we all know how that ended!  That's right!  The Devil got his ass kicked!  The Devil did!  But that's the only way he could fight the Devil!  With a fiddle!  With a fiddle!  With a fiddle!  He wasn't fireproof!  Like the Devil's not gonna go after losing the fiddle fight!  You know something?  Go fuck it!  I'm the Devil!  What am I gonna be a nice guy and go, well, you beat me!  I'm the Devil! 
[03:18:30]  So I'm just gonna take your soul anyway!  The Fiddle is the Devil's kryptonite!  Yeah!  Who would've thought?  The Devil can't get you through your fiddle!  He's a scary mofo, but in the middle of the night when the Devil comes for a visit,  just make sure you got a fiddle nearby!  Not a fiddle!  He bows his head because he knew he lost!  He knew that he'd been beat!  By some incest survivor!  And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at whose?  Johnny!  Johnny's feet!  Johnny's feet!  Probably 380 pounds in gold!  And Johnny!  What an asshole!  He tells the Devil, hey! 
[03:19:00]  You ever wanna try again?  You know, come back!  I'll be here!  I told you once!  I done told you once!  You son of a gun!  Bitch!  Because it's AM!  Why would you ever give the Devil a second chance?  Exactly!  Hey, hey!  Come on back, mofo!  I'm a tough guy with my fiddle!  I would think it'd be a hell of a fight!  Exactly!  It would have to be in an octagon or something!  He'd bet the fiddle a gold!  You forget the part after the Devil lost!  He took that faggoty fiddle player and just raped him!  And why is the Devil behind on getting souls? 
[03:19:30]  Yeah!  What's happening?  You gotta go to Georgia?  Exactly!  He wanted a stupid soul!  I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player too!  Oh!  The Devil has a hobby!  I also like to croquet!  Crochet!  God dammit!  The Devil's croqueting!  Might be a sin!  But I'll take your bet you're gonna regret because I'm the best as ever been!  Well, that's confidence! 
[03:20:00]  Everyone!  Yeah!  You like this?  You win, you get the gold!  Where are you gonna sell a gold fiddle?  Yeah!  You know the asshole probably sold it for like 15 bucks at the pawn shop, went to the bar,  got drunk, told his story, no one believed him, and they punched him in the face!  That's a sucker's bet, by the way!  Part 2 of this song!  That's a sucker's bet!  Of course it is!  I hate the fact the Devil had a band of demons!  A band of demons! 
[03:20:30]  A band of demons?  A big red bus pulls up with fire coming out of it!  And who are the band of demons?  The band of demons gets horns!  They weren't good!  They weren't good!  The band of demons gets horns!  Don't make Satan out of me!  They're not good enough to be Satan himself!  No!  Look!  They're in waiting!  They're like the VPs!  And this guy's just got a, Johnny's just got a fiddle!  Right!  And uh, Devil, a whole band!  You could hear the bass and everything!  You think when he's playing the fiddle right now it's blowing the Devil's hair back?  Oh yeah!  Oh no! 
[03:21:00]  He's looking good!  He's looking good!  So hard to play the fiddle with cloven hooves!  You have to tape the fiddle thing to it!  Croquet!  Idiot!  Croquet!  When the devil finished, Johnny said, well you're pretty good!  Oh!  Oh son!  Hey, give him a compliment!  Woo!  Bad show'em!  Fire on the mountain, run boys!  Oh!  Well, he's kicking ass!  You really think the Devil's sitting for this right now?  Yeah, the Devil's sitting, oh well!  No, I think he's pacing back and forth going, alright!  Ah!  I got my work cut out for me!  I think the Devil says, I don't care if you're better! 
[03:21:30]  Ah, I'm gonna take your soul!  That's right!  Because I always get it!  Because you're a human!  Because he always wins!  And who knows what happened after this!  This could have been in the late 30's, where the Devil got a little cranky at old Johnny  and said, you know what, that fellow with the short mustache, let's put him in charge  for a while!  Yeah, you might have just pissed off the Devil!  Now he humbled him!  Oh boy!  He laid that golden fiddle on the ground!  Why not just hand it to him?  Johnny said, Devil just come on back if you ever want to try again! 
[03:22:00]  I done told you once, you son of a bitch!  I'm the best!  Oh, wow!  Hey, Charlie!  The kids are listening, Charlie!  Devil's in the house of the rising sun!  Yeah!  And he gives the Devil a little encore!  But he even has a Devil song!  Just for that occasion!  The odds of having a Devil song ready!  And if you beat the Devil, would you really give him an encore?  No!  I think you pick up the golden fiddle and get the fuck out of Dodge!  I think at this point you should be humble, pick up the golden fiddle and just walk away!  Don't tempt him! 
[03:22:30]  Don't tempt him!  Because, I mean, you gotta regroup when you lose, right?  Yeah!  Yeah!  And come up with a new strategy!  That's right!  No fiddle playing!  Now he's gonna be like, I'm gonna golf!  I'll go to the golf course and bet someone a golden putter!  I'll bet you didn't know it, but I'm a golfer too!  The hat's all turned sideways!  Oh, that kind!  Which way is hell?  Ah, he laid the golden tiddlywinks at the ground at Lil' Billy's feet!  He was really desperate! 
[03:23:00]  He's just playing stupid games he can't possibly win!  Hey, devil!  Idiot!  Just take the souls!  Yeah, exactly!  Why don't you just play to your strengths?  Just play to your strengths like it used to!  I guess you'd break out the pitchfork in your fire!  Right!  Stop poking some people in the ass!  Your mind!  Game fucking over!  Game fucking over!  He's playing that fiddle!  Just give him a blast of heat, devil!  Yeah!  I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a macrame or two!  Oh!  I hadn't heard!  Pulls out his golden crochet hook! 
[03:23:30]  Yeah!  And croquet mallet!  Nice and fine doily!  Johnny's like, oh no!  Oh boy!  What am I gonna do now?  You win a golden doily!  Devil's a douche!  He really is!  His song is so bad!  I love that song though!  No you don't!  I like the music!  The little chicken in the bread pan!  You're picking out some dough!  You're picking out chicken!  The devil's looking!  What do you want from me?  Granny's in the middle going, what do you want from me?  No child, no!  No child, no!  I just want to play the Phillies getting fucking fresh!  Open, Open Anthony presents the All Request Worst Of Show!

Eddie Trunk's essential hard rock and heavy metal!  Forward by Rob Halford! 
[03:24:30]  Ya ha ha!  A band's starting to play complete albums now!  We gotta hear these songs though!  It's kind of a cool thing!  What do you want?  I want to hear...  Unchained and then Romeo's Delight!  Yeah, and show how fucking ridiculous your choice was!  Alright!  Put it on!  There's...  Look!  Eddie Van Halen's on your phone right now!  No, it's actually Jericho!  Chris Jericho?  Yeah!  Answer it!  It's he already...  Oh, it's a text!  I just left...  And...  Something...  How long will you be at Sirius?  I'll be back there at 1030! 
[03:25:00]  What's going on with you guys?  Oh, what's up?  I don't know!  It lays on!  Jericho has a blurb on the back of my book!  A couple of beautiful girls!  Yeah, Chris is in too!  Chris is...  Me and Chris are...  Yeah, we took...  We're like...  Cheryl Burke on your way out!  What's that?  Sorry, I'm not full of food!  Did you see Cheryl Burke on the way out?  No!  She's a dancer!  I know!  Can we do Romeo's Delight?  You want an appetizer or the entree?  Yeah, let's do Romeo's Delight!  Appetizer!  This is on Eddie Trunk's all-time Van Halen playlist!  Go ahead!  I have no problem with this!  Go ahead! 
[03:25:30]  Go ahead!  Not all at once!  I don't have anything over here!  I got unchained if you want to do that first!  Oh, you don't have Romeo's Delight?  No!  Oh, E-Rock!  What else do you have?  What else do you have from his list?  No, no, no!  Danny's got it!  Here we go!  Romeo's right!  No, he's right!  Thank you, Jared!  I didn't realize it was this!  Yeah!  Listen to that!  Oh!  That's right!  I love how the band has to slow down to David Lee Roth's vocals every time! 
[03:26:00]  What the fuck is that about?  He's talking way through a song!  He just slows everything down!  Look!  Is it done, Dave?  Is it going to rock again?  Alright, here we go!  Here we go!  Here we go!  Here we go!  Here we go!  Here we go!  High five, Daddy Trunk!  You know what?  I got him in!  I don't know that song!  Quick story about that song!  I don't know! 
[03:26:30]  Van Halen opened with that song at the US Festival!  It's legendary!  If you've ever seen the bootlegs of the video!  Legendary!  They open with that song, and the song starts where the vocal comes in, and Roth just opens  his mouth and nothing comes out!  And he starts going, literally, in front of 100,000 people!  And they get to the chorus, and he just yells to the crowd, I forgot the fucking words,  man!  And that's all he says!  Yeah!  Exactly!  And the crowd's just like, wah!  It doesn't matter! 
[03:27:00]  He never sings the lyrics!  Play Little Dreamer!  That's a great song!  That does not belong here!  That's a great song, man!  Look, I'm not going to get on you about fucking Poundcake!  That's a good one!  You're getting off easy!  Fucking Poundcake!  Wasn't that written by Firehouse?  No!  Firehouse!  Firehouse!  Firehouse!  Is this on my list, Jay?  No.  Little Dreamer is.  It is.  It was on it?  Eh.  That's alright, though.  Yeah, but this isn't the alright list.  Yeah, this is like the motherfucker list. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, this is too, this is very too self-conscious.  This is Dave, me and Dave.  I used to fucking love this song.  This is the more laid-back groove.  You need to know.  This is the more laid-back groove, you know?  Yeah.  That's all you need to know.  He's jumping around Long Island with his fucking guinea Camaro.  No, this sounds horrible.  I love how Anthony showed respect to Eddie Trunk by putting his coat on and he's got his 
[03:28:00]  backpack on his shoulder.  I am fucking out of here, motherfucker.  I'm playing Anthony out.  Now, this is what should have been on your list.  This is on my list, you said.  No, Unchained.  Yeah, you should have had Unchained.  The fuck do you leave out Unchained?  Come on.  I don't dislike any of it, it's just what you gotta do.  Let it go.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop the music.  Stop the music.  There's really no reason to play this song, ladies and gentlemen.  Uh, radio, radio.  No.  Just fucking show that fucking shit to respect, because we were all talking over it. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, this is a good one.  It's all right.  Boom!  Oh, shit.  Listen to that fucking buzz song.  Hey, Eddie Trunk, good luck with the book.  I'll leave you in the capable hands of a great hope you use.  Oh!  See you in another 10 years, Ant.  Yeah, all right.  Maybe another 10.  Fuck, do you leave this on your pound cake?  It's on vacation, everybody.  The pound cake's a great song, man.  Have a good time.  You call it from the satellite phone.  I'm gonna call it from the sat phone, from the deck of the wonderful epic. 
[03:29:00]  Get that from me!  I'm gonna be videotaping stuff, uploading.  It's gonna be like a vacation ministry.  Leave, Anthony.  It's gonna be great.  Thank you.  Are you gonna do a live from the compound from the water?  Yes, it's gonna be live from the fucking compound from the water.  You should do that.  I will.  All right, we'll see you soon.  We'll be holding down the fort next week.  See ya.  A bridge before the bridge!  Attempting, anyway.  Pay this out.  Eddie, one more thing.  Rush!  Yeah.  Why aren't they in the fucking rockin' hole? 
[03:29:30]  Oh, God.  Don't even start.  You gotta go.  No, I'll be right back.  Where's...  Opie's like, you're leaving me here with him?  No, I don't care.  I like you, Eddie.  I know, I know.  I'm busting balls, but...  Eddie's gotta go?  You're a big star.  You gotta go?  There's another show here that I know they want me to go on, but I was told you have  to end at 930 today.  No, Ant's leaving, but we didn't have to.  I would love to stay.  Can we still stay?  I want to at least ask you about Rush.  Why aren't they in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in your humble opinion?  Because...  What show does he have to do?  Are we fucking someone up? 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, because someone else has a live show that they have to do as well.  Who?  Broad something?  Broad-minded.  Don't worry about that.  So, Rush.  Danny gave me the message.  That's fine.  Danny's not in trouble.  Say again?  Rush.  Why are they not in the Hall of Fame?  Because it's a new...  Oh, Rush is just one of how many bands...  Can you imagine how many bands are not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that should?  People don't even realize it.  Yeah, but when people talk about bands that should be in the Hall of Fame at the top of that  list that in a lot of cases are Rush and Kiss.  You're right. 
[03:30:30]  And the other thing that's insane is that Alice Cooper, who just went in, waited 15 years.  They ignored him for 15 years.  Whether you like his music or not, he invented a genre.  Right.  Van Halen, who we just played, they waited six, seven years.  How did they not go in the first time eligible?  Of course.  It's a joke.  I've railed about it on TV and radio for years.  I'll continue to do it.  And I don't do it for shock factor or anything.  I do it because most people don't know these people aren't in. 
[03:31:00]  That's what Alice said in all the press he did for the Hall just now.  They all said, Alice did all this press.  He goes, what's amazing is everyone's saying, we thought you were in already.  Nobody knows.  Nobody follows that shit that closely.  What about Sabbath?  Sabbath.  Sabbath.  Sabbath.  Sabbath.  You a Rush fan?  No, I was just imitating Jimmy.  Oh.  Yeah, it's always about Sabbath.  I love Rush.  Yeah, why aren't they in the right Hall of Fame?  Please.  Do they care that they're not in the Hall of Fame?  Why isn't they kissing the Hall of Fame?  I think that all these guys say that they don't care.  They roll it off their back, but as soon as they get the green light, they go running 
[03:31:30]  and they go right into it.  They love it.  I mean, you know, they want to be in it, of course, but you can't, when you're being  snubbed, you can't be like, I really want to be in it.  But how do you deny songs like YYZ, 2112?  It's a joke.  And of course, I know me and you played the song probably a thousand times each on our shows.  Tom Sawyer, Live Life.  Spirit of Radio.  Spirit of Radio.  Come on.  That shit still is great when you hear it.  Come on.  I'm not sick of those three songs.  Thin Lizzy might be the most underrated person in this part.  Thin Lizzy?  Person?  You know, Pink Floyd might be the best guy, the best guy ever. 
[03:32:00]  By the way, which one is Pink?  I would say Sid.  They're so fucking, I don't know.  Does Pink Floyd make your book?  Did Phil not just fucking vanish?  No.  Because they're not really, they're not a hard rock level man.  I know.  Phil died almost 20 years ago.  I don't know anything about that.  O.D.?  Yeah, he had a lot of heroin and a lot of problems.  But you know what?  There's a new lineup of Thin Lizzy and obviously it'll never be Thin Lizzy without Phil,  but Vivian Campbell's in it and it's really good. 
[03:32:30]  I just saw them a couple weeks, last week, they were amazing.  Songs are amazing.  They stand the test of time.  They're amazing.  Unfortunately, in the case of Thin Lizzy, they're one of those bands that are known in America  for one song, Boys Are Back in Town.  But in Europe, they've got like 20 hits.  A little bit jailbreak.  A little bit.  A little bit jailbreak, yeah.  But not to the degree of Boys Are Back in Town.  But Bon Scott, like talk about doing a cover and taking it to the next level.  Oh shit.  Thunder!  You mean Brian Johnson?  Wasn't that Bon Scott jailbreak?  Oh, I thought, never mind.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, no.  He made it out!  Yeah.  Great stuff.  You got ACDC in here?  Of course.  If you don't have Thunderstruck on this list, then I probably don't.  Thunderstruck is terrible.  Thunderstruck's played out.  You don't like Thunderstruck?  It's cheesy.  Yeah, it's great when I'm at a fucking Islanders game.  Yeah.  It's not great when I'm listening to an album.  Yeah, I'm a D!  You know, how many songs have been ruined by sports stadiums now playing the same...  Come on.  I can never hear Crazy Train as long as I live.  Every sports stadium...  No Thunderstruck figures.  Why does every sports stadium have to play Crazy Train and Welcome to the Jungle?  Why? 
[03:33:30]  Because it's fun.  That was my first ever show in my life right there, Jay.  Kiss at the Garden.  First album I ever bought, Kiss Love Gun.  It's Kiss at the Garden.  Look at that.  PLJ Presents.  That was the day.  77.  What page?  What page, Jay?  107.  107.  I gotta tell you, your Kiss playlist is really...  Lame?  Well, I don't know enough of these songs.  Opie with the glass half full mentality.  I love that.  You know my mentality?  You got too much glass.  Kiss.  In all fairness, I grew up liking Kiss.  I haven't liked them in a few decades. 
[03:34:00]  Well, I can't look at Kiss now.  Gene Simmons...  There you go.  Sorry for the half glass on that one, but that was justified.  No, you're right.  I'm not a big Kiss fan.  The last few years of Kiss have just been not good.  No, why?  Because he's just a dick.  But not only that...  Gene Simmons is just a dick.  Not only that, it's just...  You've got a band that they've got two guys being impersonating the other guys.  Right.  And that, to me, is the line that, as big of a fan as I was, was crossed.  I found the biggest problem in the book, and it's Iron Maiden.  You don't have Number of the Beast or Run to the Hills. 
[03:34:30]  Run to the Hills?  Yeah, but they're just...  You're thinking...  What do you mean?  It's just...  Come on.  What page is that?  It's played out.  You're trying to turn people on to songs that should be bigger.  But it's not...  Those aren't my favorite songs.  They're not...  It's just...  Run to the...  No.  It's not.  There's so much better stuff on Number of the Beast.  I'll tell you one thing.  It's a book that certainly stirs up...  I mean, we're...  Discussion.  We could sit here for two hours.  Can we go Def Leppard for a sec? 
[03:35:00]  I'm still not off Unchained.  How the fuck did you...  I mean, play it again.  It's not only just about the songs I picked, though.  I know, but that sounds on all the songs on this tracker.  I am in the wrestling room at Verona High School fucking people up right here.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!  Splits!  All right.  Can you add a chapter to the book for J-1?  And by the way, I'm gonna add an amendment for J-1.  Keep it...  Alex Van Halen.  Charlie Watts tight right here.  Alex is a great drummer. 
[03:35:30]  Alex is a great drummer.  So underrated.  But in this song...  He crushes it.  Are you having...  It's a great song!  My fucking pound cake!  My fucking pound cake!  Pound cake's a great song!  All right, go do pound cake now.  All right, pound cake.  We don't have it!  Eddie, you might have to admit you messed up on this one.  Leave this!  Leave this!  Go to the chorus!  Oh, my God!  This makes me so happy!  Stop rocking down to dinner!  Down, down, oh! 
[03:36:00]  I'm gonna go fucking hit somebody in the throat.  All right, let's go pound cake now.  Pound cake.  Because this is what Eddie decided.  Instead of unchanged.  And that's all gonna get slow and deliberate  what you and Anthony were talking about.  It's the same type of groove.  Two, one, two.  Who's got it?  Here's pound cake, J.  You!  Eddie's gonna admit he's wrong by the end of this interview.  This is pound cake.  That's the fucking gayest shit I've ever heard in my life. 
[03:36:30]  Yes.  All right, I'm wrong!  I'm wrong!  You got me wrong!  I'm wrong!  Guilty as charged, J. Moore!  Guilty as charged.  And this was a radio hit, Eddie.  It's a great song.  I don't like radio hits.  That's why I left off Number of the Beast.  They play it constantly.  No, it's not only-  That's not the only criteria for being left off.  You have an Iron Maiden playlist without Number of the Beast or Run to the Hills.  I don't!  Number of the Beast isn't on there?  No!  I guess I got it. 
[03:37:00]  I ran two years ago, J.  It takes a long time to get this thing out.  This is garbage.  Oh, it won't feel that.  There's pedals for his voice.  Hope's not feeling either.  No, I'm not feeling this one.  Unchained now.  I'll be honest with you.  I played it a million times on the radio by now.  Back to Unchained.  Go Unchained.  Listen to that!  And right before the chorus when it goes down, down, down, down.  Hold on one second.  I gotta cease.  I'll be right back.  Oh, they're pissed at you. 
[03:37:30]  It was my fault, Eddie Trunks.  What happened?  I told him not to go to his next interview.  Can you turn this up in my head?  Oh, yeah!  I hope you're still on when I come back from this.  But if you're not, thank you.  Where are you going?  Is it the shade?  I don't know.  No, Eddie, we're not going to be.  So what's the big plug?  Get the book signing out of the way again.  All right, so Eddie Trunks essential hard rock and heavy metal.  No, no, no.  Don't rush it.  Oh, turn your headphones way up right here.  How fucking...  All right, let me have the plug and then you can play it.  Thank you. 
[03:38:00]  Book is out now.  Not now.  This is the best part, Eddie.  Turn it up.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Woo-hoo!  Oh!  Oh!  Eddie, come to the hard rock.  You guys coming?  Let's fill...  No, I'll be there.  The pre-parties ain't fine for free.  Come on, Eddie.  You're going to be confused when you leave the studio. 
[03:38:30]  Know this.  You're a friend.  Thank you, O.  That's a good book.  I appreciate it.  I just broke character for a second.  Honestly, I appreciate it.  Get the hell out of here!  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How the fuck?  Wait a minute.  You're not going in here.  How is Hot For Teacher not on here?  Yeah, what about Hot For Teacher?  You fucking don't...  How did you miss Hot For Teacher?  Run!  Go for the fucking...  Hot For Teacher.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Goddamn, listen to that.  Don't you just want to do fucking curls right now?  Yes.  Just... 
[03:39:00]  No, no, no, no.  Fucking make that vein pop out.  Incline Ventsch.  That hurts.  We're too old for that shit.  That's you, not me, man.  You look at me.  I'm all inclined press.  You can still do the incline.  That's why I got this gut!  Hold on, let it play now.  I could have done without that.  One wick coming up.  Now you've got to turn it off.  Oh.  Nice. 
[03:39:30]  Let's go.  Oh, and he overdubbed.  The song's Shut Up Jay Moore, so it's got to be good.  Let it play.  Let it play. 
[03:40:00]  Now, how the fuck did he leave that up the list?  And how did...  He has Pound Cake.  And Hot for Teacher.  No, he goes Pound Cake.  That's rough.  Hot for Teacher.  I would argue for Hot for Teacher.  Hot for Teacher?  Would you argue for any Sammy Hagar, Van Halen songs?  None.  That's not Van Halen to me.  Not a one, right?  I don't give a fuck how many they sold.  Van Halen is fucking Van Halen.  I think they sold more.  And you've got to have...  We have this argument all the time.  No, they did sold 50 times more. 
[03:40:30]  I think we were wrong every time we say that.  No.  They sold 50,000 times more than Diamond Dave.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you ate one too, and 5150, and all that stupid shit.  I think we lose this argument every time we bring it up.  No.  Somebody comes out with the numbers.  You've got to have Ain't Talking About Love.  Absolutely.  And you've got to have Hot for Teacher and Unchained.  What about Little Jamie's Crying, or is that too?  I don't like it.  What about Little Guitars?  Little Guitars is sweet.  Cinerina, I'm in trouble again.  And what song, or in what order, Hot for Teacher, Unchained, I guess Unchained is one. 
[03:41:00]  No, Unchained, Janelda.  That's...  When you go to the mothership, to that big electron in the sky, as George Carlin says,  when we show them the scented toilet paper, the shoes that light up, and the fake vomit,  and all the cool stuff we've done down here.  That's pretty good.  You've got to play them Unchained on the mothership and go,  this is some fucking shit we worked on when we were down here.  And then you fucking do curls on the mothership.  This song's crazy!  Oh, man. 
[03:41:30]  That's pothead shit.  You ever smoke grass and just do curls, low weight, and just fucking vibe out on your bicep muscle?  I'm thinking of doing some pot again.  I'm thinking about it.  But you can't go Unchained.  What do you start with?  You know, you've got to fucking do the build.  No.  Then I go with Hot for Teacher.  Then start with Ain't Talking About Love.  It's the first track on the first album.  Right.  I mean, they were almost called, like, Black Widow or something, right?  I forget.  Play Ain't Talking About Love.  Because that's...  How do you leave it?  Fuzzy guitar. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, how do you leave it off?  There was, like, one pedal invented then.  I told my wife, if we ever do karaoke, I'm going to get super fucking stoned,  and I'm hitting this out of the fucking park.  I'm doing it.  I'm going to fully do it.  Does she just roll her eyes?  Does she humor you, or does she roll her eyes?  No, she'll tell me if I'm a fucking douche and an idiot.  But most times, she doesn't.  Baby!  Oh.  Not on Eddie Trunk's essential Van Halen playlist. 
[03:42:30]  This didn't make it either?  I got something you need.  Oh, yeah.  Ain't Talking About Love.  How happy would you be, Oak?  Me and you, a couple buns.  We smoke a little bun.  We're at some fucking bizarre karaoke night, and I go, you guy ain't talking about, and  I fucking do this.  And you go?  But, like, no, but no irony.  I'll go.  Logan!  I'll go to film it.  Out on the streets again!  Oh, yeah!  I'll bring fucking machetes on stage. 
[03:43:00]  He blew it with the Van Halen playlist.  Bad.  Worse than any other band, right?  Yes.  All right, and Hot for Teacher?  I like Hot for Teacher.  Incredible.  I think that might be one.  Hey, we had them on our show!  Little girl from Cherry Lawn, how could you be?  Cherry Lawn, New Jersey?  Fucking a nice Jersey reference.  I don't know it.  That's where she's from.  That's where the substance is from.  I don't know that.  Little girl from Cherry Lawn, how could you be so bold? 
[03:43:30]  I did not know that gold I knew.  This is when they had those drums where they weren't drums.  Like, you'd see them at weddings.  It'd just be a guy with, like, a little cardboard square.  No.  Yeah, you do.  I'm out.  I'm out.  The non-drum drums.  Like, the electric drums.  The guy would just hit, like, a fucking...  Oh, the tiny little fuckers?  Yeah.  Yeah, I got you.  Tom-toms.  Thank you.  Kind of Tom-tommy?  No.  They look like this.  Brown napkins.  You know?  Danny, you know.  I think maybe you're talking about drum triggers? 
[03:44:00]  Drum what?  Triggers?  Instead of setting up a drum kit, a guy would set up, like, a drum with, like, little targets.  Like an electronic kit.  Like a...  Oh!  How is this off the list?  New words.  How's this?  I'm getting Trump's list.  Why don't we do this?  Get the plugs in.  Something like that?  We're out of here, Jay.  Exactly.  Time to start the weekend.  Jay Moore's is going to be at Foxwoods a week from tonight.  Really?  But you'll be in next week, right?  Yeah, I'm coming in.  I've got to do a corporate gig.  Wait a second, man. 
[03:44:30]  Hold on a second.  What do you think it's just going to look like this year?  I don't feel tardy.  There's no words.  Was this the last great Van Halen song?  Yes.  What came out after this?  It's all, um...  We'll stick with the David Lee Roth years.  Yeah, it's all...  Oh, my God.  And Eddie's never been better. 
[03:45:00]  Listen to what he dubs on top.  Hold on.  Not on the list.  I'm a carolifer.  I forgot the...  I brought my pants off.  This is the fucking course.  Oh, man.  I heard you missed this. 
[03:45:30]  We're back.  Hey.  Hey.  Somebody just yells,  Hey.  There it is.  Give me something to write.  Ooh.  This one gets good.  In the bikini in the video.  Oh.  Ooh.  Oh.  Hold on.  We're almost done.  I heard about your essence,  but this is so, so good.  Ooh.  I know about this, though.  Here you go.  Little girl from Chery Laugh.  How can you be so old? 
[03:46:00]  How did you know they're going to roll?  I think you're all...  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Now we're just playing songs.  Why not?  It's Mystery Science Theater 2000 with music.  Oh, yes, I'm on!  All right, so I put Unchained first.  Of course.  On the list.  Like, I might put it first out of, like, all the songs ever. 
[03:46:30]  Nah.  Really?  Am I essential...  Van Halen...  There's something about that opening fucking makes me want to kill somebody.  We should write our book and knock his book out.  Fuck, yeah.  We'll cop...  Let's do that.  Quickly.  Really quickly.  We'll bring it to the hard rock tonight.  We'll go digital.  Digital download tonight.  Digital download tonight.  Tonight!  Your girl and my girl tonight! 
[03:47:00]  What's the...  What's the number one Van Halen song, then?  Oh, man.  No, you nailed it.  Unchained.  Yeah, it has to be.  Isn't it funny when you're at the gym listening to your iPod, the guys around you have no  idea how close they are to being punched in the face?  Because you're just feeling it.  And you fucking rack up, like, you know, like, whatever you're benching, like, incline,  you just fucking rack that shit, and you're like, mind if I work in?  You're like, no, go ahead, you motherfucker under your breath. 
[03:47:30]  Like, I'll fucking get...  How many more sets you got?  Just two more.  Yeah, you're good.  You're good, you fucking faggot motherfucker.  I'll fucking kill you.  Listening to fucking Jane's Addiction.  Ocean Size.  And you gotta talk to me now?  Oh, my God!  OMG!  Oh, my God!  Unchained.  Unchained. 
[03:48:00]  Ain't talking about love.  Hot for Teacher has to be on that list.  Can we throw Mean Streets in there or not?  I think it's on.  I think Mean Streets is on there.  Oh, we're doing our list outside his list?  No, I'm just saying what he missed.  I go, where's your...  Meanwhile, Rush has 24 fucking songs.  Well, yeah.  And Van Halen has 15.  Mean Streets is not on his list.  That's what...  I guess for the people out there, Eddie's playlist for Van Halen really quick.  Hear about it later.  Judgment Day.  Good Enough.  Somebody Give Me a Doctor. 
[03:48:30]  Love Walks In.  Atomic Punk.  On Fire.  In a Simple Rime.  Romeo Delight.  Light Up the Sky.  Little Dreamer.  Girl Gone Bad.  Pound Cake.  Fools.  DOA.  I don't know most of those songs by name.  I don't either.  And then when they played Romeo's Delight, I went, oh yeah, no, this can stay on.  So a few of those, I would go, oh yeah, that song.  But how do you keep Number of the Beast off for Van Halen?  I mean, for...  No, how about Run?  You gotta have Run.  Give us Run.  The White Band came.  Give us Run.  Do you want to end with Run?  Listen to this.  That's great for the fucking gym.  I don't give a fuck.  It's been on the radio a million times. 
[03:49:00]  When you're done with your workout today, gentlemen, hit the treadmill.  Put it on seven miles an hour and just run the length of the song.  Like a man.  And you could do that with this song.  Totally.  He's got fucking aces high in two minutes to midnight on his list.  What a dope.  Eddie, you stink.  Fuck yeah.  He took our game for his own need.  We fought him hard. 
[03:49:30]  Fuck yeah.  It's about fucking trench warfare.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, look at this.  Damn hell.  Atta boy, O.  Tempo change.  Hi-hat.  I think he went for I Gotta Be a Little Too Cool.  I gotta tell.  I gotta tell like it is.  The only good engine is dead.  Here you go. 
[03:50:00]  Can't hit this note anymore.  Here you go.  Run to the hills.  Run for your lights.  Foxwood's April 8th.  Foxwood's April 8th.  I'm gone.  I'm gone. 
[03:50:30]  Here you go.  Here you go.  Doesn't it seem like you got in the book if you took a picture with Eddie?  Like there's UFOs in here and stupid things.  But then there's a picture of Eddie with the lead singer of UFO.  As long as there's a picture with Eddie, you make the book.  That's pretty funny.  And David Lee Roth made it.  He's gonna be confused.  We love you, Eddie.  Everyone knows.  We love Eddie.  Yeah, I didn't even know that was up for debate.  That's why I'm shitting out so hard.  You should know that much before.  Brian May?  Underrated.  I like the Brian May.  He's alright.  Underrated.  He's alright.  He's alright.  Rainbow is in here.  Fucking Rainbow? 
[03:51:00]  What's wrong with Rainbow?  I don't know.  They're named Rainbow.  What's wrong with Rainbow?  The name is Rainbow.  But they had the Rainbow before the other Rainbow.  What's the best band name?  I like Soundgarden for a band name.  Soundgarden's a great name for a band.  It's a pretty good one.  And a great fucking band.  I like Smashing Pumpkins better than Soundgarden.  I realized listening to my iPod,  going through my gym workout with my priest father, Tim.  What song do you like by Smashing Pumpkins?  Siamese Dream, to me, is a perfect album. 
[03:51:30]  It's like grunge, but it's more accessible.  And the lyrics are much more poetic than the other guys were doing.  What was the hit song on there?  Cherub Rock.  Cherub Rock's cool.  Fucking, the one I hated was...  Today is the dream.  You don't like that?  On that album,  there's some progressive fucking chord changes on that album.  I might have to go through that again.  It's been a while.  If you play Silver Fuck,  you got that? 
[03:52:00]  From Smashing...  Smashing Pumpkins,  Silver...  Is it Silver Fuck?  Or Mayonnaise,  Silver Fuck?  There's some crazy metal songs on there.  And you work out to that?  Yeah, I mostly work out to  Jane's Addiction live bootlegs.  Yeah, why do you like Jane's Addiction so much?  When you used to be on Twitter,  you tweeted a lot about the Jane's.  And Rufus Wainwright,  I like to balance it out.  Why do you like Jane's Addiction so much?  I like Mountain...  We argue this point.  I love Mountain Song.  I'm Ocean, you're Mountain.  I love Mountain Song.  I love Mountain Song too,  but Ocean Size to me...  I wish I was Ocean Size. 
[03:52:30]  No one moves you,  no one tries.  We're all over the place.  You want Silver Fuck  or you want to go Jane's Addiction now?  We've done this Jane's Addiction.  Let's hear Silver Fuck real quick  off Siamese Dream.  That's fucking good stuff.  It's very long though,  so you can't...  Yeah, I love that sound.  Yeah.  I fucking love that sound.  Let's do a beach run, Oak.  Man on the Silver Mountain, Rainbow.  That's why it's in the book.  That's why it's in the book.  That made it gayer. 
[03:53:00]  Man on the Silver Mountain?  When they're doing that on...  All right.  What are we doing?  Running the beach?  Yeah, this is good for a beach run.  You see where I live,  the dolphins.  And what is a dolphin  if not a gay shark?  He stole that from Glee!  No, actually,  they stole it from whoever was saying it.  They actually took that line  from someone.  Hey, Sam,  what are we doing  at 10 o'clock hour?  Well, we have an exclusive interview  with Anthony and Jay Moore  that was just conducted  in the hallway 
[03:53:30]  that's riveting.  It was terrific?  Yeah, I mean,  it was amazing stuff.  I'm going home  to listen to Siamese Dream.  Hope is perfect.  And it was...  I don't really know the album, Jay.  I gotta be honest with you.  When I was on Saturday Night Live  having crazy fucking panic attack,  this was the soundtrack.  This is what came out.  They came on  to promote this.  Right.  And Cherubrock is  freak out,  give in,  doesn't matter what you believe in,  stay cool,  be somebody's fool this year. 
[03:54:00]  Who wants money?  Who wants money?  Like, it was my fucking...  I couldn't believe  these bands were...  Talking to you.  Yeah.  I was like a fucking  crazy, crazy, psychotic,  crazy person.  So why would you listen to this  if it caused panic attacks?  Because they were...  Oh.  That hits you.  God, that hits you.  I feel no pain.  Where are you at  with the panic attacks?  None.  How do you cure yourself? 
[03:54:30]  I take Klonopin daily.  A little bit?  One in the morning,  one at night.  What dose?  Half milligram in the morning,  half milligram at night.  And when I fly,  I'll take like a Xanax.  And just...  Plus, I was very unhappy  and you know me now.  You know me more  than the other guys.  I'm just like a super happy...  Nothing fucking bothers me.  Fuck do I care?  It's the key to life.  Just get some stupid happiness.  Every time I see Gaddafi,  he looks like fucking  Jeff Ross.  Jeffrey Ross.  Let's go eat. 
[03:55:00]  Jay will be back next week.  We'll talk more about  his panic attacks.  We'll tease that.  There's some serious  fucking work going on in here.  He's a genius.  Yeah.  I think Billy Corrigan's a genius.  Ant doesn't...  I don't think Ant likes  special pumpkins.  I'm not sure.  Ant still...  He's fucking...  Right now he's listening  to Steve Miller in his limo.  It just goes and goes and goes.  How long is this song?  I don't know. 
[03:55:30]  Like eight minutes.  Alright, I'll listen  to the rest on the way home.  Sam, you ready for this?  Yeah, I was born ready.  Alright.  Were you?  I was.  You couldn't fucking feed yourself.  How were you born ready?  I was ready for this.  Rolling.  It's an expression, Sam.  How was the show today, Rolling?  Because officially we're done.  So this is like  we don't have to try now.  But I was supposed to ask him  how was the show.  This is nice in the background.  Yeah, we could keep this on.  That's what I love about you guys.  When you interview people  you don't have to play fucking  I get knocked down!  And then I get it out 
[03:56:00]  the whole time.  Like fucking  why am I listening to this  on the fucking Q Morning Zoo  in St. Paul?  We try to do it differently.  A little gentle guitar  over the Madness Hope.  You know what?  I think you just turned me  on to a song.  It's almost Grateful Dead-esque.  Yeah, I know.  That's why.  This portion.  I kind of like some of that  weird shit.  Smoke a little grass  fucking hang out.  You ever think about  why he decided  this needed to be in the song?  If you want to go deep?  Constantly.  That's all I think about.  If you want to go deep  like why did he need 
[03:56:30]  that little part  in the song right there?  She was my lover.  I think about that  every time I listen to music.  Like weird shit  and music?  Not hits obviously.  The weird trippy stuff.  No, constantly.  And like when you listen  to the Stones  like Monkey Man  like  you gotta be a real rock star  to go  and not be  worried that the other people  are gonna go  you sound like an idiot.  Yeah.  I'm a monkey!  Right.  But he fucking  pulls that off.  Like why is that in the song? 
[03:57:00]  And was he under the influence?  And if he was under the influence  I'm gonna guess  Vodka, Vicodin, and Pot.  That was my question.  This is great NyQuil.  This is like  when I was  fucking whacked on NyQuil.  This was  You over that?  No.  I'm a walking fuck.  Yes, of course I'm over it.  How many years?  Have I not done NyQuil?  Those years were wild.  Probably ten.  Wow.  Eight?  I remember  Sobriety's a lot easier  if you put your years  in a row. 
[03:57:30]  Way easier  if you just fucking  line them all up  one after the other.  When you take breaks  it's really hard.  I did a few  runs with you  to the  to the store  in between Caroline shows  the good old days  the NyQuil  and they go  we got the pills  and I'm like  fuck pills  the NyQuil pills  the NyQuaps  you need the liquid.  Yeah.  Any fucking  anybody can take the  I never understood that 
[03:58:00]  I'll be honest.  Alright, what's that?  Why that?  Why is that there?  Here we come.  We're coming back now.  Hold on up.  He's coming back.  What a bald genius. 
[03:58:30]  Not unlike Roland.  Back to you, Roland.  Alright, Roly.  What's up?  Let's fade this out.  Oh, my neck.  I don't know what  I'll be honest with you.  I don't know what  this sounds like  and I  in a way  it hurts so bad  I have to shit.  What happened?  I'm in so much pain  I have to vomit.  Wait, you can't  Oh, my God.  What is happening  is right  I read your lips, Danny. 
[03:59:00]  I'm not getting  to shut up, bro.  What are you doing?  Are you going to  shit your pants?  We're going to  do a job.  Where is it?  It's all the way  to the right.  And then to the right.  Yeah.  Look, I don't  need your tweets.  I don't need your tweets.  I really don't know  what this sounds like  but I do know  I'm enjoying  the hell out of myself  right now.  I don't 
[03:59:30]  I don't even care  if you're enjoying this.  This is so  fucking weird.  The Quest  One Stuff Show.  Continuing on with that bit.  Here's part two.  Jay had to go to the bathroom.  What happened?  He had to go poo-poo.  Because his neck  hurt so bad  he had to shit.  People have to understand  that his whole  head and neck  are way over  to the left side  of his body.  Like way the fuck over.  He's got a real  situation that he has  to take care of.  He looks like  the alien from  Men in Black  when it took over  the farmer.  Right, exactly. 
[04:00:00]  Exactly.  He ran all the way  down the hallway.  He was going to shit  himself.  He must be  in a situation  because he's  in such pain  I don't even think  he could walk  and he just ran.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He got the shit he's out.  And his legs  are all stiff-legged.  Whoever doesn't  want to continue  is fine.  I don't care.  I just  he ran down  the hall to shit  because he has a bad neck.  I need to know  what the fuck's going on.  I mean the show  is a cesspool.  Liam's not happy  that you're calling him  back in by the way.  Why?  You have somewhere else  to go?  Jay Moore left 
[04:00:30]  because he has a  No, no.  I don't have anywhere  else to go.  I'm done now.  Jay Moore left  because his neck hurt  so bad he had to go shit.  I thought it was  because Unchained  wasn't in the book.  Yeah, we came up  with a few more problems.  Oh, Jesus.  What were the other  songs we decided?  Hot for Teacher.  We played the whole thing  and now we're starting  to think that should  have made the book.  Really?  I always thought  that song was  kind of goofy.  What was the greatest?  I asked Jay,  what was the last  good Van Halen song  with David Lee Roth? 
[04:01:00]  Jay basically said  Hot for Teacher.  In your opinion,  if you could think  that way.  Well, again,  people are going  to go crazy about this.  I was never  a big Panama fan.  Obviously,  we're talking about 1984  because that was  the last real record.  So Hot for Teacher,  Panama,  never a big fan.  Jump, forget about it.  When I first heard Jump  and I heard that  keyboard thing,  it was like,  I almost hurled.  I was like,  this can't be Van Halen.  Maybe something 
[04:01:30]  on that album.  Panama.  Drop Dead Legs.  Panama over  Hot for Teacher.  I'm going to have  to bring that up.  What about  Drop Dead Legs, man?  That's a great song  on 1984.  Yeah, that's a pretty  good song.  You know?  Mm-hmm.  For me,  you know this  because you did  music radio forever.  You know this.  I mean,  the songs that  always came up  on your playlist  are the ones  you kind of  bristled at.  Except for  Run for the Hills.  Or to the Hills.  But that didn't get  played that much.  That wasn't like  a hit hit. 
[04:02:00]  You're right.  And for me,  that song  everywhere I go  and whenever I go  to Iron Maiden,  you know Maiden  doesn't play  that song live.  They haven't played  it the last couple  of years  because they're  burnt out on it.  Swear to God.  You should have seen  the crowd went  almost nuts  because the house  lights go on  and no run to the hills.  Get the fuck out.  Swear to God,  the last few tours.  Why would you do that?  Because don't you think  more people are in the audience  that want to hear  that song than don't?  And that's always the point.  And I think that song  probably bought a few  really nice cars 
[04:02:30]  and a really nice castle  somewhere.  But see,  Iron Maiden have an  interesting situation  with America  because I've always said  I think it's a little bit  of a love-hate thing.  They really,  really don't like  the fact that  their new music  isn't played  and supported  in America.  They're a global band.  I mean,  there's Stadium Act  around the world.  And their new music,  their records chart  and they get a lot of success.  But here,  you know,  everyone wants to talk about  Run to the Hills  and Number of the Beast  and they just can't  take it anymore.  And they just,  they played one tour 
[04:03:00]  where they played  nothing but music  from the last 10 years  and nothing else.  I don't mind that  if the band tells you  ahead of time.  Exactly.  They're sick of hearing it  about my Neil Young story  where I didn't know  that he decided  he wasn't going to play  really anything familiar  as far as,  you know,  the hits that we all know.  I didn't know ahead of time.  If you tell me ahead of time,  then let me,  then I'll decide.  Petty did that too.  Really?  Petty did a bunch of stuff  from his new album,  but that's it.  And I tell fans all the time  that bitch about it.  It's like,  it's real easy.  One click on the internet  and you can find out  after one show 
[04:03:30]  anywhere in the world  what the playlist is going to be.  Do your young work.  Find out.  The Neil Young story  goes before the internet  was what it is today.  Why are you running in here?  Jay's wiping.  He's coming back now, Mars?  Yeah, well, he's wiping.  It's going to be a long week  with Jay Moore,  let's be honest with each other.  He's a great talent.  Jay's here all next week with you?  Oh my God,  with no Anthony.  God help me.  Hey Jay, how'd it go?  That was close. 
[04:04:00]  Hope was just talking about  how much he's looking forward  to having you here all next week.  Oh yeah, he's going to save.  He's going to save the show.  I'm going to shit my pants.  But why did...  I don't know why.  You were the one  that wanted to continue.  I was ready to end 20 minutes ago  if you had a log poking out.  I didn't.  I just looked at you  and suddenly there was a flash panic.  You were prairie dogging?  No, it was going to be  like throwing mud off a roof.  It was messy?  It was horrible.  I had to wipe my legs.  When did you stop liking music?  By the way, I just...  No, what year? 
[04:04:30]  What year?  What year?  I just checked my Twitter feed.  I have like 140 mentions  of fucking pests.  I'm like,  no, you don't understand.  And all of them are saying  how horribly you fucked up Van Halen.  Why?  How the fuck do you...  Buy the book and tell me  it's fucked up.  Why?  Just because of one song  on a playlist?  Hot for Teacher?  Eddie, I got to talk about...  Hot for Teacher is kind of goofy.  I got a business idea for you.  As opposed to fucking Pound Cake?  Yeah, I love Pound Cake.  Do you get a website?  Do I?  Pound Cake was at  edtrunk.com, yeah. 
[04:05:00]  So why don't you have people  discuss songs that should be  in your book?  Because that would cause  traffic and interest, Opie.  He's not interested in that.  What are you saying again, Opie?  What do you mean?  You didn't...  It just came out today.  You didn't fucking put Unchained on.  That's the one we will not  let you go on.  All right, but...  Hold on one sec.  And somebody wrote,  if you want to see  how messed up Smashing Pumpkins  were during Siamese Dream,  check out Vuforia,  the movie they made for it,  which I didn't even know  was out,  so they must have been  really fucked up,  so that's good.  I swear to you,  if we get to a second printing, 
[04:05:30]  and maybe thanks to  your plugs, we will,  I will have them clear space  and add Unchained  with a little asterisk.  Give me a...  And I will put...  For Opie and Jay Moore...  No, you don't do four.  You give us a page.  A what?  I want a page in your next book.  Are you going to pick songs?  What about Die With Your Boots On,  Fire Maiden?  Great song.  But why isn't it on the fucking...  I can't!  Two minutes to midnight  when you're in high school.  What are you in your fucking garage?  Wait a minute,  two minutes to midnight is bad?  It's not as good as...  Run to the...  Run to the Hills.  The fact that... 
[04:06:00]  I feel like Colin  talking to Bobby.  The fact that you left off  Run to the Hills  shot your face!  Jay, I did the playlist  like two years ago.  Listen to me.  It doesn't matter.  The song was written in the 80s.  Listen to me.  I'm going to explain something to you.  I wrote these things  and I put all these songs in there  and then the editor says,  you've got to cut back 15 songs.  Not on Rush.  They have 24 songs.  It depends upon...  They have short titles.  But...  YYZ.  Lime White.  Hold on. 
[04:06:30]  Unchained.  Yeah.  Back...  Hold on, hold on.  Back to Jay's point.  You had to cut 15 songs.  That means...  Fucking...  15...  You still have 15 songs in there  that you think is better  than Jay's song.  Unchained.  Yeah.  I'm sorry that Unchained  has never been one of my favorite songs.  I know Jay has flashbacks  to his football years  in Verona or whatever,  but for me,  it was not one of my favorite songs.  That was like a fucking Guido  that I'd be running around  playing football?  What did you say you played?  I wrestled.  I wrestled.  I'm sorry.  You know what you're doing?  You know what you're doing?  Football practice?  You play football. 
[04:07:00]  I grew up in Madison,  so my football...  Neil O'Donnell.  Eddie, I got...  Yeah, I went to high school with Neil.  Eddie, I got a challenge for you.  Danny's a Metallica fan.  Right?  Yeah.  Let's look at the list.  Ride the Lightning's not on there.  I'm fucking going home.  Yeah, let's look at the list.  Is Ride the Lightning on the list?  No.  I don't know.  I don't remember.  Of course Ride the Lightning.  Who wrote the book?  It's the playlist.  Then what kind of fucking publisher  Wait.  The playlist in the book  is like 2% of the book. 
[04:07:30]  You can tell him he's having his own show.  Your dwelling on the playlist  is 2% of the book.  Obviously, it's the most intriguing part  of the book.  No, it's not.  You didn't read it.  Everyone in the room  is obsessing over the playlists.  Because people can argue  your playlist.  I like that.  That's the most impressive.  I like that.  That's what's happening right now.  But I like that idea.  What kind of...  It's a water cooler conversation.  It's a driveway moment, Eddie.  They pulled me back into the studio  for a second time.  Eddie, what kind of publisher  do you have that they...  Hold on.  What kind of publisher  do you have that you write a book  and they hold it for two years? 
[04:08:00]  Well, it's from the time  I wrote that.  But yeah, it took six months  of printing alone  before they put it out.  I'm glad you didn't take  the book seriously.  What?  That you don't know  what's in it.  All right, where's Metallica?  I don't really know  every song I put.  I love all these songs.  Let me just make a statement.  Page 130, right now.  Right now, 130.  If Ride the Lightning  isn't there,  there's no reason  for you to be here.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Wow.  Is it in there?  Yeah, but it's 10.  I don't even know.  I'm looking at Jay.  Jay exhaled like he just...  I was like, wow,  I'm going to have to leave. 
[04:08:30]  I swear to God, Eddie.  Don't tread on me.  If we talked about  the stories in the book,  I could give you a million.  You're focused on one part  of the book.  I'm trying to pull some stuff,  a little something  from the catalog.  It's an ultimate playlist.  I know, but I'm not going to...  How a hit can you be?  It's not a hit.  I'm trying to be cool.  It's not trying to be cool.  Eddie Weezer,  just grab the fucking songs  out of the air  that you want.  The best part about this book  is the essential playlist.  No, it's not.  It's the least thing.  How could you disagree  with my opinion?  The photos.  No one's ever seen  those photos.  The stories.  You know the fuck  about photos? 
[04:09:00]  Every...  Jay.  Are you my fucking grandma?  Come on in.  You want to see it  when he was nine?  Jay, this is Richie Blackmore  when he was at the...  Jay, you didn't read the book.  It's like picking up a magazine  and just looking at  the pull-out thing, you know?  How is Jake...  Holy shit, now it's bullshit.  Now I text the guy  all day long  and won't text me back  because he's a big author now.  I'm in here over here.  Are you a Van Halis fan?  Of course I'm a Van Halis fan.  Turn to page one.  How could you not be?  Here we go.  No, don't say a word, Eddie.  We just want you  to see this list cold  and tell us what you think. 
[04:09:30]  Did you get the book yet, Chris?  No, I haven't.  Shut up, Eddie.  Eddie?  Eddie, I've never met this man before.  Look on with a friend.  Go to page...  What page am I looking at?  That coffee smells good.  It's too bad I've had 40.  Oh, wait a minute.  Shut up, Jericho.  Get into this  because something just hit me  about Jericho  and this is going to be great.  So go ahead, Chris.  I'm going to kick back  and watch page defend this.  Page 230.  Page 230.  This is his ultimate  Van Halis.  This is Van Halis.  Essential playlist.  Okay, here we go. 
[04:10:00]  You tell us what's missing.  What's missing.  Typical pretentious Eddie Trunk.  Hear about it later.  Judgment Day.  He's getting fucking heated up.  Look at him.  All right.  Atomic compound.  We're going to sell a lot of books.  In his simple rhyme,  Romeo Delight,  Light Up the Sky,  Little Dreamer.  Girl come back.  We're about to get in trouble again.  Hot for Teacher,  the best Van Halis song.  Not on there.  Jericho's about to go.  He's supposed to go live  in one minute on another channel.  Hot for Teacher is missing,  which is the best Van Halis song  with the best Van Halis group ever.  Come on.  Dude, the one song we're all...  Panama is not on here. 
[04:10:30]  No.  You're not going to get this from him,  Ope.  You're not going to get this from him.  Because tell him, Chris,  who's your favorite singer in Van Halen?  Play it.  Roth.  I thought you were Hagar.  No.  I'm the Roth guy.  I'm the stupid Eddie Trunk guy.  Don't be a huge fan.  Come on, man.  You love the Hagar stuff.  He loves the Hagar stuff.  I wanted to be the David Lee Roth of wrestling.  What?  We're going to get into the show.  I want to talk real quick.  Just fucking play the songs.  Do you like the song Pound Cake? 
[04:11:00]  Yes.  Thank you.  I do.  And good enough also.  Should it be here instead of Unchained?  All right.  We're getting in trouble.  Where's it got to go?  It's a great tune.  It's got a great solo to it.  Thank you.  It's probably the best Van Halis song.  I got to go.  I want to stay.  We got another problem on our hands.  OutQ's mad at us?  Oh, dancing.  No, he's just getting their schedule.  Dancing.  What show are they doing now?  We're the only show here.  What's OutQ?  We're the only show here.  Who's on OutQ?  OutQ's the gay channel.  I know, but who's on OutQ?  Jericho?  I like the gays.  Yeah, Jericho was supposed to be on it a couple minutes ago. 
[04:11:30]  What?  Are they mad, man?  They're cool?  No, no, they're fine.  Your book is going to sell a lot.  It's exceptional.  It's going to...  But I think you super...  Your publisher, which is Abrams Image, they really...  They tied one of your hands behind your back, Eddie.  With what?  Cutting the playlist?  Yeah.  They should have let you have your playlist.  But I don't believe, Eddie, on the cutting the playlist.  They did, Jay.  I'm going to give you your email.  I'll send you my real playlist that I made.  No, Jay's answer's on because it...  How do you not have two... 
[04:12:00]  Oh, you do have two...  You want to make it look like a Greatest Hits album, so he wanted it this way.  Molly Crew is pretty good.  Too Fast for Love.  Yeah, you want to...  Molly Crew, you take the entire first album and just smack it on the playlist.  Best album.  The first album.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Too Fast for Love.  Super high voice.  The best album.  You know, Jay, just to talk about the editing, in the back of that book, the last two pages,  it's more essentials, and there's like three paragraphs of books that are just one chapter,  bands with one chapter, and you know what?  Those bands were all full chapters. 
[04:12:30]  I had to cut all those back to one paragraph.  I have the opposite problem.  I hand in my book, and they go, that's 60 pages, dummy.  And I'm like, I've been writing for four months.  And they go, no, it's got to be at least 200.  I'm like, all right.  Eddie, looking like an author in the back.  That's from the set of a TV show.  You see that, Jay?  Eddie, his author picture is better than your author picture.  It sure is.  I look like a special boy.  All right.  We're going to go home, finally.  All right.  I'll see you guys next week.  Monday, Tuesday.  But read the stories, really.  Come back to me when you read the stories.  You will.  That's the best part of the book.  Oh, wow.  These are the bands you didn't include. 
[04:13:00]  They got cut.  Yeah, but you...  Who got cut?  Hold on a minute.  Triumph.  Cinderella had no business being on here, so that's good.  You don't like Cinderella?  No.  Very underrated band.  I think so.  Very underrated band.  True.  Grunge knocked them out when they were about to hit.  And they also, because they were so glammed up on the first album, they actually are a  bluesy rock band.  You know who knocked Poison and Cinderella out with one shot?  Nirvana.  Jane's Addiction.  Nirvana.  Before Nirvana.  Jane's Addiction.  Jane's was around before Nirvana.  Jane's Addiction came out and we went... 
[04:13:30]  Soundgarden was around before Jane's, right?  Jane's Addiction changed what we were listening to.  It's such an important band.  Nothing Shocking was 88 and their live album was 86.  All of a sudden, you got Mountain Song and Ocean Size instead of, ooh, diddy, bop, bop.  And we went, what the fuck are we doing?  This is some real shit.  I'm going to leave it out on that note.  Peace.  Today's Worst of Opin' Anthony show is brought to you by you, the listener.  I love Joe.  Happy fucking rolling. 
[04:14:00]  It was the funniest bit ever.  And it was classic.  It was amazing.  If you didn't like what you heard, pick something better.  Okay?
