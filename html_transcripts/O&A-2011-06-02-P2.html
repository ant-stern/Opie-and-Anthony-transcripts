<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show’s “After O&A Live” segment focused heavily on the aftermath of Paris Hilton’s disastrous interview.  Sam Roberts was a primary participant, detailing the fallout.  Rich Davis from the “Morning Mashup” joined the discussion, revealing Hilton’s cancellation of appearances on both his and the Covino and Rich show.  The conversation was punctuated with frequent, strong vulgar language expressing frustration and amusement at Hilton's unprofessionalism.  Hilton was described as uncooperative, vapid, uninteresting, and evasive, wearing sunglasses and a hoodie throughout the interview, providing unsatisfactory answers even to simple questions about her community service and showing no interest in promoting her own show.

The hosts addressed criticism from Larry Flick and another host from the “Al Q” morning show, whom they felt unfairly accused them of emulating Howard Stern, despite their attempts at a polite and respectful interview with Hilton.  Several staff members, including Eric and Troy, voiced disappointment at missing their chance to meet Hilton.  A humorous anecdote involved Roland throwing an empty coffee cup at Sam Roberts, startling him.  The segment concluded with speculation about the “Al Q” morning show’s motivations behind their criticism and plans to address the situation on their own broadcast the following day. The overall mood amongst the hosts and staff was a volatile mix of anger, disbelief, and dark humor stemming from Hilton's behavior and the subsequent criticism they received.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  Continues.  It's After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Of all the eventful shows,  it's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts. You already knew that.  Opie and Anthony left here, and for once, after all that controversy,  everybody in management seemed to think it was a good interview.  Everybody was on Opie and Anthony's side. 
[00:00:30]  This is something we're not used to.  Usually when stuff blows up, we're getting yelled at.  But for once, this show was not the culprit.  Rich Davis just walked in before we went on.  No, I heard that you guys are heroes.  You're fucking renegades of good radio.  Now, Rich, you're on the morning mashup.  We found out Nicole came in on O&A and said that Parasiton blew off the mashup.  Were you going to have her on Covino and Rich, too?  Yeah, I was supposed to do the back-to-back mashup and then Covino and Rich.  Is that uncomfortable for you?  It's uncomfortable.  What I've done, though, is I only do one. 
[00:01:00]  Because how do you interview the same person twice, especially someone that's not that  awesome?  Yeah.  But I think you guys pulled a...  I'm sort of glad that happened because I didn't really want to interview her.  So you were going to interview her with Covino.  Yeah.  What's the vibe around here?  Like, when you found out that Paris Hilton was blowing everything off, was everybody  saying, oh, those Opie and Anthony assholes screwed it up for everybody?  Or was it she was...  Well, based on reputation, everyone probably thought that you guys, you know, went where  you should have gone, which was asking her about probably jail and sex tape and all that.  We didn't even bring up the sex tape. 
[00:01:30]  And then when people found out that you guys were actually playing it down and being nice  to her...  So that's the word that's getting around?  But the word is that Opie and Anthony were complete gentlemen and it's all her.  Good.  Thank God.  I know I was talking to Spencer and the people in talent, everybody in talent realizes what  happened was not our fault.  And apparently, according to Roland, Paris' people were also like, what's Paris doing?  Like, why is she doing this?  So you don't care about missing the interview with her? 
[00:02:00]  Well, you sort of did me a favor.  I didn't have to look up fake questions.  So how come...  Or what I wanted to ask her?  How come then we find out that, I guess, Larry Flick in the Al Q morning show, apparently,  according to fans, were calling Opie and Anthony shock-jock assholes who were trying to be  like Howard Stern?  That ruined their time with Paris?  With Paris Hilton.  I mean, you'd think that they would...  I'd hope I'd want you to have more planned than that on your daily agenda.  Like, move on to the next thing?  Yeah, and moving on to the next thing, hopefully, it's most likely better than the Paris Hilton 
[00:02:30]  interview.  We lost the Paris Hilton interview.  Thank God we can move on to the next thing.  We can have a real-life conversation.  Yeah.  Eric, are you bummed out you didn't get your picture signed?  A little, but that's all right.  You should...  The only thing I'm bummed about, Kavino and I have a lot of listeners in town this week,  is...  Oh, the Dude Bro Convention.  The Dude Bro Convention.  I know.  I had to co-host Poundstone Power Radio because...  You're tired from carrying that channel?  I don't know what you're talking about, Rich.  He's a good dude, but did Jeff...  Was it entertaining? 
[00:03:00]  It was entertaining.  It was a good show.  I made sure of it.  But we have a lot of listeners in town, so guys are stringing by the studio.  And I guess it would have been cool for them to see Paris Hilton because a lot of these  guys from, you know, listeners across the country probably never saw celebrities.  So that would have been cool.  But besides that, nah.  She had...  She left her giant sunglasses on the entire time.  How do you...  She had a hoodie and sweatpants.  Look at Norton.  Jim is just furious.  Jim, have you gotten over this?  Jimmy, I heard that you could have been more fucking polite to this girl.  I was...  By the way, I know that Kenny's waiting for me. 
[00:03:30]  He's sitting in the car right now just staring vapidly at the fucking steering wheel.  I'll be right out, buddy.  Troy is bummed out, by the way, because he was trying to aim for a little picture with Paris Hilton.  I don't blame you.  I was livid.  Livid.  I'm more livid, though, because she's just a spoiled, vapid brat.  I said vapid twice in the same hour.  I want to bet.  You're upset.  I heard you set her up with, like, fucking nice questions, too, like, to ease it in.  I did set her up with nice questions.  I wasn't trying to knock her teeth out at all at the interview.  No.  I was hoping, because it's a reality show, that she would be slightly revealing. 
[00:04:00]  And I asked her.  Everyone knows she went to jail.  It was on every news channel.  So I said, how did that change you?  And one of the questions was, she was doing a cleanup on the wall.  Right.  She was cleaning up a wall for community service.  So he said, what did you do?  Like, why did you?  Oh, I just did a thing.  You're showing the fact you're doing community service in your fucking show, and somebody  asks you, what did you do?  Why is that a secret?  It's a public record. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  You unrevealing, fucking blithering idiot.  Because.  I haven't dropped a C-bomb.  I'm amazed I haven't.  But I want to save it for those fucking out-cue motherfuckers who were blasting O&A.  Both of those guys, we say hello every day, how are you?  And those fucking assholes immediately assume that we fucked up and start blasting us on  their show?  They hated us when we first got here.  Then whatever happened, we were on good terms with out-cue.  We were all saying hi to each other, good morning, blah, blah, blah.  And then all of a sudden, like, Rich was supposed to, he was, because he's on the matchup and 
[00:05:00]  Covino and Rich, not only was the matchup supposed to get Paris Hilton, but Covino and  Rich were supposed to get them.  I just want to thank you guys for saving me time.  I was kidding.  We said every other show other than out-cue knows that O&A and you didn't do anything wrong.  We did nothing wrong, and I understand.  Well, how fucking clueless, Jimmy, could she be coming in here?  I mean, did no one brief her?  They probably did, but we were going to give her, we don't, we weren't going to.  To me, she's an easy target to attack, and that was the one I didn't unload on her, because  she wasn't attacking, she was just being kind of cunty and defensive. 
[00:05:30]  There's that C-bomb.  Yeah, but there's a Y at the end of it.  Adjective.  You cunty can be kind of affectionate, like, I can't make you cunty goose.  But I didn't, that made me very, very fucking angry.  She was supposed to be here until noon, and the guy who runs Shade 45 just gave me a  thumbs up through the window.  Your heroes are on here.  I guess she was supposed to, maybe she was supposed to do Shade 45, and everybody's psyched  so that they don't have to, thank you, interview Paris Hilton.  She stunk as an interview.  She was a horrible interview.  And I thought that, like... 
[00:06:00]  What a boring person.  At the very least, even if she didn't want to go in-depth about what she did, she would  at least have some kind of tongue-in-cheek mentality about what her life has become.  Let's get back to the show.  You fucking bore...  Nobody!  You don't...  These people don't know how to sell a show.  It's like, if people like you, if they find you interesting, they will watch your show.  You dope!  You dope!  How fucking disheartening that she's a celebrity.  Like, how she's so disinteresting. 
[00:06:30]  How disheartening that people care.  I don't even...  She is a horribly, horribly uninteresting individual.  It's strange that, like, people think that they can come in here, do a bad interview, and  just mentioning the show will make people watch it.  Like, you don't have to be a captivating person, as long as you just say what the name of  the show is, and you're on the air, everybody will turn it on.  Yeah, and I know when we're aggressive, and I know when we're dicks, I know when Opie's  going to be a dick, I know when Ant's going to be fucking...  You can tell by the little... 
[00:07:00]  Like, Opie will say shit and move the mic, like, you know when Opie's gearing up.  Yes.  And you know when Ant's gearing up, because Ant will do his little things, but neither one  of those guys was doing that.  No.  They were not at all feeling shitty or aggressive, and neither was I.  We were all playing ball with the publicists, but what I was saying on the air before was  that people who are fans of the show knew exactly what was going on.  Like, Justin Stengel, on his Twitter, said that he was laughing at Opie, just uncomfortably  laughing at all of Paris Hilton's answers, realizing where it was going.  And like I told you, Travis and me were... 
[00:07:30]  Travis and I.  You're right.  Travis and I were dying laughing in the other room, watching you through the window, trying  to maintain your composure.  I was so angry.  You just had the rage, the Norton rage was just fueling in you.  But it literally is like, it's a really weird thing, like, the guys I've argued with on  the show ferociously, Chris and both guys that could kick the shit out of me, there's  something about arguing with someone who's an easy target, like, attacking them that just  kind of turns me off.  It's like, ugh.  It's like fucking smacking a kid in the face. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  But I should have been more aggressive, because she was abominable.  That wouldn't have been an attack.  She was a terrible interview.  And the point wasn't to attack her.  We didn't book her on the show to attack her.  That's what annoyed...  I even said to her, did you have like a preconceived idea?  Yeah, you did.  You broke it down.  Because you did the one thing that nobody else was doing in the room, which was, alright,  let's put the cards on the table.  You're obviously acting a certain way.  We don't have any of these intentions.  You're being defensive for nothing.  And what Opie said to her, you're annoyed.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Opie did say that.  And it was like, I just... 
[00:08:30]  Do you think Jim's coming down?  Sorry, Kenny.  Kenny can call in if he's nervous.  You don't have to wait for me, Kenny.  I'll take a cab.  You don't have to wait.  It's okay.  Who cares if I'm killed on the way home?  You won't feel guilty about it.  What do you care?  You're a big shot.  Kenny, you don't have to wait.  I'm teasing you.  He'll wait anyway.  No, he doesn't have to, though.  He will, though.  I don't need to sit in fucking traffic, because I'm on the...  It's no problem.  It's no problem.  She fucking...  I'm more annoyed at the out cue guys.  Because I like those guys.  I genuinely like those guys.  And I would say hello to them.  I ride the elevator up. 
[00:09:00]  There's a black guy and a white guy.  Larry's the white guy.  I don't even know the black guy's name.  I just see him every day.  Keith.  Keith, that's right.  I genuinely like those guys.  And we say hello.  But to come off and just start brutalizing us.  Oh, they want to be like this and that.  It's not that the insults of what they said didn't hurt.  It's the fact that, oh, that's how these guys feel.  Why am I nice to these motherfuckers?  They immediately jump on us.  They're jumping to these conclusions.  I would like to hear what they said, too.  Because our dopey fans are the only ones that have told us that they really...  Roland, have you heard anything yet?  Because I know you said you wanted to listen to what Al Q said. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, they were making fun of Jimmy.  All right, Roland.  If you can't take this seriously, we won't invite you back in.  Yes, Roland.  This is no time for jokes.  By the way, I've got to tell you something.  That was obviously the moment of the day, the whole Paris Hilton saga.  For me, the other moment of the day was in the middle of the wiener segment on the show.  Roland throwing that empty cup of coffee on your lap.  You almost hit the ceiling, you jumped up so high.  You were about to smash Roland with your fists, not verbally, until you realized there was no hot coffee in that cup. 
[00:10:00]  He got me so good.  He got me really good when he did that.  And he got the show when he said, I have an interesting human being coming through the door.  Two for two.  She's not listening, but I want, here's her worst crime.  She's a bore.  Yeah.  She's a bore.  Like, that's worse to me, because there's people that are assholes that aren't boring.  You know what I mean?  What does she bring to the table?  What does she bring to the table?  Literally, she's beautiful.  I was attracted to her.  She's very good looking.  And dude, I can't kill the show, because I said in front of her that I liked it. 
[00:10:30]  So again, it's a pussy move to kill it now.  Now, it's interesting.  I liked it more than I thought I would.  I have to say that.  And I even said that to her.  Like, that's a compliment.  You're going for a male.  I'm telling you, I'm not your target demo.  I'm a fucking self-hating white guy.  And I'm telling you, I enjoyed it more than I thought.  Living the life in such a huge spotlight that she has, that every move she makes has been on TV is an interesting thing.  Going to jail is an interesting thing.  The sex tape is an interesting thing.  But she wouldn't talk about any of it.  No, she was disgustingly uninteresting. 
[00:11:00]  So I'm telling you, I can't bash the show because, again, I praised it at one point or said it wasn't bad.  You want to watch the show, don't do it based off that interview, because she revealed nothing.  I mean, I don't...  Nothing.  And the talent department said the reason she was up here was to get guys watching.  Like, the purpose of this trip, that's why she was doing us, Cavino and Rich, Shade 45.  The purpose of this trip was to get the guy audience, which I think she blew it.  She blew it completely because she's such a spoiled, emotionally spoiled individual. 
[00:11:30]  She was terrible.  She was...  And everybody who knows you would go, oh, yeah, but no, you guys were mean to...  No, we weren't.  I've been mean to people.  I know what it's like to be mean to people.  Yeah.  And how it feels to fucking...  To sink into somebody.  And I didn't want to do that with her.  I wanted to have fun with Paris Hilton.  Why wouldn't you?  She's fucking hot.  It would have been one of those beautiful things where everybody was like, oh, Paris Hilton.  And you turn it around and she becomes...  She has a good time on the show.  It's happened with a lot of people.  It's happened with almost...  With most of them.  On the phone, we've had trouble.  But who have we had problems with in person in I don't know how long? 
[00:12:00]  Especially females.  Females always end up coming in here nervous and always end up leaving, having a good time.  Starting with Mila Jovovich, right?  She loves it.  She fell off her chair, literally, laughing.  Because Anthony's...  And she came back.  Because Anthony was doing the Russian thing.  It was like, every time they're nervous about somebody, we are not assholes.  It's almost like we know you're expecting that.  We're not going to be dicks.  We fucking...  You know, it's Paris Hilton.  We know who she is.  We're not morons.  Yeah, the last fight that you got in was Jesse Ventura. 
[00:12:30]  And that wasn't even...  That was because of what was going on in the interview.  That wasn't like, here, let's get him in.  That's not...  This show doesn't book major celebrities to be controversial.  We might book like a lame like author to piss on his book or something.  But it's a different deal.  She came in.  Opie was right, too.  When he said that she thinks she's too good for this play.  He was right.  Because what happened was she never would have pulled that shit with Piers Morgan.  No, she was crying on Piers Morgan.  She had her mom next to her.  She was talking about the sex tape. 
[00:13:00]  She was talking about jail.  She was talking about how she thought she was in love with Rick Solomon.  She was talking about everything.  So the radio guys get nothing.  That's what drives me crazy, too, I guess.  And again, I should have said that.  Sunglasses on texting?  The whole deal?  Was she...  She wasn't texting while she was in the studio.  But she left...  She had her arms folded the whole time.  She was in like a very diminutive position.  And she had giant dark black sunglasses on the whole time.  Which is why when she came in, some people, when you come into a room full of...  Sharon Osbourne, the first time she came in.  Jim Belushi was on that day.  Right. 
[00:13:30]  And I heard that she said to him, how are they?  Because she was nervous coming into our show.  She didn't understand that I worshipped her husband and would never be mean to her.  But she didn't know.  She had heard shit about this show.  And she was scared coming in.  Yeah.  And she was very defensive.  And she opened up immediately because she's not a fucking dummy like this one is.  She ended up being so comfortable with this show that she came on the air and made fun of Susan Boyle.  Like, that's how comfortable she is on this show now.  This is like...  This show, once the hosts like you, it's the most comfortable place on radio.  Not the most...  Like, it's the one place where a guest can come and hang out. 
[00:14:00]  I mean, I don't know anything about that because it's rarely comfortable for me.  Yeah.  But...  As it shouldn't be.  But it was very frustrating.  Now, what frustrates me the more is that she just didn't walk out going, I'm not going to be berated.  Yeah.  Like, you fucking spoiled baby.  Nobody berated you.  You little baby.  Like, you don't get to dictate.  You're the interviewee.  It's not up to you to dictate.  But we didn't berate you.  We just wanted to ask questions.  I just wish her sandwich just came so I could eat it. 
[00:14:30]  That's what you wish that her food ordered?  I don't know, though.  But I wish they ordered it.  It had honey mustard, whatever it was.  And she didn't like the question about drinking and getting high.  Like, are you still drinking a little bit at a party?  And you know, I don't have time.  What do you mean you don't have time?  Yeah.  How long does it take to take a pill?  Yeah.  You have time.  Everybody has time.  Everybody has time.  How about a nightcap?  Everybody has time.  Yeah.  If you're not...  If you're doing it, you're doing it.  If you're not, you're not...  But again, the Osbournes, not to bring it all to Ozzy, because that's what I do, was 
[00:15:00]  a revealing reality show.  And the only thing that they wouldn't sign off on, they said, if anything embarrassed  the children, that Sharon wanted veto power over it, is the children couldn't anymore.  And we've had Ozzy, Sharon, and Jack in since, and they're...  I mean, everybody in the Osbourne family has a great interview.  Dude, you fucking...  You watched the documentary they just did, the talk Sharon said about when Ozzy said,  we think you have to die, and he tried to choke her.  Ozzy, when I did him one-on-one, the fucking first thing he says about drinking was,  I'd have a plan on trying to kill my wife, and he goes in...  Like, he's a revealing, great interview. 
[00:15:30]  Are you an Ozzy fan?  I'm partial to him, because I like some of his older music.  I haven't followed him recently.  Did you want to...  Troy?  No, she's just so used to having an ass kiss everywhere she goes.  Yeah, it's all about Troy.  He's got to say something all the time.  He's right, though.  I just think, I mean, when she answers interviews, questions like that in interviews, and she  gives these bullshit answers, they just tiptoe around, they don't confront her and be like,  what are you doing?  Like, you don't want to open up and confront her with that.  They just kind of...  Okay, whatever you say, Miss...  Because they want the next interview, or they want Nikki helping to come in.  Exactly. 
[00:16:00]  Wouldn't you feel shitty, though?  Let's say you came to the table, and you were on someone's show.  I would feel like pressure, like, I've got to entertain, or reveal something, or fucking  be open.  An entertaining person does.  Wouldn't she leave here feeling shitty, like, wow, I gave them nothing?  No, because she has...  No.  Because she's extraordinarily emotionally spoiled, and has no ability to see herself accurately.  And she thinks there's...  But think of you, Jimmy.  When you go on other people's shows, TV, radio, anything, you always bring it.  Like, you have the...  Don't you have the vibe like, man, I fucking better bring something to the table.  Because a comic or a radio guy is not what that is. 
[00:16:30]  Jim judges himself on his content, whereas Paris Hilton just believes that there is so much  value...  Her being here was enough...  In the presence of Paris Hilton, that she has nothing to prove, and there's no reason  for her to bring anything.  She did wear these headphones, by the way, that I'm wearing right there.  I'm kind of excited about that, yeah.  That's exciting.  Listen, I'm sure Club Soda Kenny is downstairs waiting for you, and we have to let Ron and  Fez jump on anyone.  All right.  I'll fuck Ron and Fez.  I just want to catch you on the show now, because we got trashed.  They cost us this interview.  They were bothering her on the way in. 
[00:17:00]  We'll find out what Al Q said by tomorrow, I'm sure.  Yeah, they're picking good enemies, right?  Yeah, really.  But for no reason.  Smart move.  Yeah, we'll see.  Well, the saga will continue.  At least that's something to look forward to tomorrow.  Troy?  I did post a picture of her in studio on my Twitter.  Troy Kwan.  Check it out.  You're a fucking asshole.  Shameless.  It's not about you.  It really isn't.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right.  I'm coming down right now.  I hurt my leg, so I can't walk.  I hope Kenny right now is by fucking West End Avenue.  Okay.  Okay.  He hates me.  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  Nice, E-Rock.
