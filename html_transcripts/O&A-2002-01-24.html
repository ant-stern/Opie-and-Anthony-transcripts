<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts promoting their "Naughty Nighty" contest, encouraging women to submit revealing photos to their website, lamenting the low participation outside of New York and Cleveland.  They teased an upcoming call from Scott Farrell for a Boston-centric trivia question.  The hosts then launched into a rant about the New York Air Awards, recalling a past defeat and their own snub of the ceremony, while sharing opinions on various radio personalities including Scott Muni.  A significant portion was devoted to a discussion of their "Stalker Patty" MTV Cribs parody video, with listener calls following, including one from someone recounting a past encounter with the hosts at an awards show.  The show took a sharp turn to express outrage and disgust towards John Walker and his family, playing audio clips and using profanity to condemn Walker's actions and his parents' defense of him, speculating on potential book deals and movies about the situation. The segment concluded with more promotion of "Naughty Nighty" and further commentary on John Walker, interspersed with comedic banter, caller interruptions, and studio noises, notably from a limo driver.


The next segment began with morbid humor about a bus-shaped limo, before announcing a WBCN-sponsored giveaway: a trip to a Patriots-Steelers game, with Scott Farrell's participation planned. The call-in numbers were repeated. The show abruptly shifted to a 9/11 rant, followed by a demand for "nude girls." Studio guest Louis Black, after a security delay, joined the discussion, engaging in darkly humorous conversation about John Walker, speculating about his motivations, including his father's sexuality. Black mentioned bringing a date to the "Naughty Nighty" contest.  The hosts then launched into a scathing critique of an unnamed 80s sitcom, playing clips and fueling their negative commentary with calls from Mac, Adam, Frank, Alex, and Jim, who interjected their own opinions and off-color jokes.  A large portion focused on Black's upcoming Comedy Central special and the network's restrictions on his language, leading to a comedic search for euphemisms.  The segment also touched upon various sports teams and athletes (Patriots, Steelers, Bruins, Drew Bledsoe, Tom Brady).  It concluded with Scott Farrell's call conducting the Patriots/Steelers ticket giveaway, a lengthy trivia question about Brett Favre, featuring caller attempts to answer and the announcement of a winner.  Future plans, including a Philadelphia live show and a visit to the Mutter Museum, were discussed along with details about Scott Farrell's schedule.


The following segment discussed Scott Farrell's job security, followed by an unexplained statement about "checks being shoplifters."  The focus shifted to "Naughty Nighty," with Louis Black recounting anecdotes about Rick's photography of the contestants, drawing comparisons to *Star 80*. Black shared stories of his past misbehavior, including "bun runs," and reminisced about a shared prison experience with the hosts.  Numerous calls followed, discussing contestants and juvenile pranks. Several women participated in the "Naughty Nighty" contest in the studio, with much on-air discussion of their bodies and clothing, the hosts encouraging more provocative displays.  The show repeatedly promoted opianthony.com for contest photos. The segment included detailed descriptions of contestants, their physical attributes, and participation, using vulgar and sexually explicit language.  A "6 o'clock queef" segment and an attempt to arrange a live on-air deflowering were mentioned, though unsuccessful.  A supposed "midget village" near Philadelphia was discussed, generating listener calls.  The segment concluded with more "Naughty Nighty" entries and banter.


The final segment featured a female caller, a John Jay College student, referred to as a "fat girl" with crude and sexually suggestive comments about her appearance and intelligence despite her mention of straight A's.  The conversation touched upon a celebrity softball game with Louis Black's confirmed participation.  A "Naughty Nighty" entry featuring Shannon and her nightwear elicited further sexually suggestive remarks from the hosts.  ProFlowers.com sponsorships were interspersed.  The show promoted their Philadelphia live broadcast, including the Mutter Museum visit and Jim Norton's appearance at the TLA, teasing Norton's clothing choices.  The segment concluded with listener-submitted "what I learned today" entries, many crude or nonsensical.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.B. and Anthony show a couple phone numbers right off the bat here  and write these numbers down so we don't have to say it every day, huh?  Keep it in your wallet.  In my wallet.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027. 
[00:00:30]  Anywhere else, including...  Yeah.  Boston!  866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  I mentioned Boston right off the bat, Anthony, because we have a trip for two to see the Patriots versus the Steelers.  Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.  Yeah.  Courtesy of WBCS.  Go pass! 
[00:01:00]  And we have a great way to give it away today.  You know him, you hate him.  He hates your town.  Boston.  Scott Farrell will be on our show with a, uh, probably a tough trivia question.  Of course.  Directed, uh, just for you people up there in Boston.  And he'll yell and scream at you guys for a while because he loves doing that.  So stay tuned for that. 
[00:01:30]  Also, the Naughty Nighty contest continues today.  Naughty Nighty.  We had a horrible day yesterday as far as that goes.  Well, I'm sure the girl that showed up yesterday would be very happy to hear that, Opie.  No, she was fine, but she was the only girl that qualified.  So you're saying quantity-wise, eh, it was bad.  We're on in a lot of cities, and a lot of these cities are in on the contest.  Girls are not showing up at the station while we're broadcasting to get their pictures taken. 
[00:02:00]  Girls, do you realize what's up for grabs here?  We have a lot of girls representing New York.  Not even a lot.  What, four or five girls?  Uh-huh.  And we have one girl from Cleveland.  That is it.  Cleveland.  Where are the girls from Philly, or Washington, or Boston, or Buffalo?  Well, Sacramento.  San Fran.  San Fran is now in on the contest, Anthony.  Wow.  So it's open up for guys now?  Is that what, uh, you're saying?  It's simple as this. 
[00:02:30]  If you hear our voices right now,  you can go down to those stations that I just mentioned,  and they are standing by with a digital camera.  You show up with your naughty 90,  they take a couple pictures, they send them down to us,  we put them up on opandanthony.com, and we all have fun.  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  You can tell who my favorite is.  Who?  One with the golden locks.  Teen Melanie.  Teen Melanie.  Teen Melanie.  Anytime you mention the contest,  I've got to punch that up and look at that dumper. 
[00:03:00]  Teen Melanie.  I hope some ladies show up here in New York.  Yeah.  Come on, ladies.  Please.  Between now and seven,  you can come down with your naughty 90s  and get your pictures taken.  The guys love it.  Then you become a star.  Yeah.  Now, how many people have checked out  Teen Melanie's pictures by now?  By what?  Thousands upon thousands upon thousands.  Mm-hmm.  All right?  The bar.  So there you have it.  Those are two of the many things we're doing today on the show.  Oh, Louis Black stopping by. 
[00:03:30]  Louis, very good, from The Daily Show.  Back in black.  And there's a lot of controversy here in New York  because you and I were not nominated for a New York Air Award.  Isn't that weird when you're not nominated?  You know why?  You chose not to be nominated.  We didn't send anything in.  You got it.  End of discussion.  If you send in a tape, you are automatically nominated.  That's it.  You're nominated.  We hate the Air Awards.  We say it every year. 
[00:04:00]  It's like a fake award.  I'll tell you what happened.  Yeah.  It's a bunch of the radio guys get together  and they have a really expensive lunch.  They kiss each other's asses.  And then they hand each other awards and stuff.  It's a joke.  Okay?  We got soured on the Air Awards when we were working in Boston.  Yep.  And we were still young radio personalities  and all excited about winning awards and stuff.  So we submitted a tape and then it got back to us 
[00:04:30]  that we were nominated for Best Afternoon Drive Show in Boston.  Uh-huh.  And we were very excited.  We actually put on ties and stuff and went to the luncheon.  Oh, it was ridiculous, Norton.  This is about seven years ago, Jimmy.  Yeah.  All excited.  I wore a suit that I don't even know the last time I wore it.  I'll even jump in in Opie's defense.  Opie really didn't want to go.  He was like, dude, you want to do this?  Actually, I bummed that answer.  I was getting very disappointed.  I'm like, you know something?  Because I knew nothing of, A, this business, B, this Air Award thing. 
[00:05:00]  I had no clue that it was, you know, the station sends in tapes from all their shows to be nominated.  So I'm like, you know, Opie, this is kind of a cool thing.  You know, I've been in radio now for three months and I'm up for an award.  And as a member of this program, I would kind of like to go and see how we do in this award thing.  Is that okay?  And what did I say to you?  Because I really just... 
[00:05:30]  All right, you stupid little bastard.  You know in the end they're just going to F us.  But if you want to go, we'll go.  I'm all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.  Right.  You know, a rookie in the biz, Norton, hoping to go to my first little awards show.  All right, comb your hair and send your suit to the cleaner.  We'll go.  Here, all right, we'll go.  But we're getting F.  Don't let me...  I did say that.  I did say that.  Yeah.  So we went and we got F'd. 
[00:06:00]  And now, you know, there's a lot of people that listen to us every day that just hate our guts.  Let me tell you, you know, they're like, oh, yeah, they got F'd.  You know, another show beat them out.  Yeah, but let's explain the show that beat us out.  Yeah.  Some fat bitch that worked on the...  What station up there?  Jamming?  Jamming.  Might have been Jamming.  And so they announced the winner of Best Afternoon Drive Show in Boston.  And we're eagerly at our table with our general manager, the midget, and a few other people. 
[00:06:30]  And they're all looking at us as we're trying to look cool as we eat our stupid, tiny little  chicken thing and stuff.  Yeah.  And they announced this fat broad from Jamming.  Uh-huh.  And we're like, oh, that sucks.  All right, well, we gave it the old college try.  Yeah.  And we were nominated.  I was disappointed, but you know something?  That should mean something.  I was happy to be nominated.  That should mean something, you know?  And then they said, well, we're now going to play a piece of the winning tape. 
[00:07:00]  This is the tape she sent in to win Best Afternoon Drive Show in Boston at the time.  It was a weather break.  Yeah.  A little music playing in the background that she was in trouble.  We got beat by a girl doing weather on the radio.  And that soured us to this day.  Like, oh, this is just a complete joke.  A bunch of people getting together to kiss each other's asses.  So, but then in New York, we were forced to submit a tape because Scott Herman upstairs.  Yeah, Scott thought it would be really good. 
[00:07:30]  He's very involved with the Air Awards, I guess, or when we first moved to New York.  So, he pretty much forced us to send in a tape, remember?  Yeah.  He actually submitted it.  He submitted it himself.  Yeah, he thought it would be a great thing for the station and the show.  And he's on the board or something.  So, he sent it in.  And what bit was it?  It was Bernie Getz.  Bernie Getz Squirrel. 
[00:08:00]  His missing squirrel.  His missing squirrel with the Tom Brokaw doing the thing.  Right.  And lo and behold, it won.  We won.  Didn't somebody have to be there to accept Ben?  Ben and Earl.  Ben and Earl accepted because we didn't even show up.  We didn't even go.  Who do you think you are, Brando and George C. Scott?  Yeah.  I said, if I go, I want to bring an Indian to come out on the, speak at the podium about  the plight of the Indians.  We wanted Earl to go as, like, me and Ben to go as Anthony. 
[00:08:30]  We tried to get midgets.  Yeah, we did try to get midgets.  Yeah, shake it up a little bit.  They got insulted.  Yeah, so we won, and we didn't even go to accept the award.  So, I guess in the paper today, all the nominees are here.  Yeah, it's kind of odd.  You see the morning show nominees, and there's a little something missing there.  Yeah, the highest rated show in New York in the morning.  In New York history.  They're going to nominate it. 
[00:09:00]  Not there.  Well, that's because, you know, there's no tapes.  No one sent in tapes.  Midday.  Ah, Maria Melito.  She's nice.  She seems cool at the queue.  She's good at playing those two firsts.  Yeah.  I hope she wins.  I'm backing Maria Melito.  She's one of the best Segers in the business.  And she actually can tolerate Scotto.  She could say, God, Tuesday's gone, it's a free bird like no one else.  She seems very nice. 
[00:09:30]  And Scott Muni, legendary DJ here in New York, since they went from Morse code to actual voice over radio waves.  Since the Beatles landed on the tarmac, my friend.  Yeah.  We're welcoming the Beatles here at Idlewild Airport.  Virgin.  Virgin.  And he's going to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Air Awards.  Well, good for him, Anthony.  Look at this.  Funniest Minute Award. 
[00:10:00]  Funniest Minute?  Yeah.  There's a Funniest Minute.  We should have submitted for Funniest Minute.  Maria Melito from the queue talking about staff restroom.  Come on.  CBSFM, the limits of an office chair.  And, uh, Z100 Morning Show parody.  And someone submitted the Halloween show for Funniest Minute.  There you go.  All right.  Well, good luck to you.  All right.  Good luck to you. 
[00:10:30]  And then, of course, newscasters.  This one is going to be huge.  I'm sure they'll bring up September 11th and how all the reporters here.  But I see just a bunch of reporters from WINS, WABC.  See, I'm Judy DeAngelis.  I'm backing Judy.  Judy.  Where's John Montone?  Not nominated?  Montone?  I'm outraged.  John Montone is nominated for Best Reporter, Anthony.  Is he?  Where is that?  Best Reporter?  Right under a newscaster.  Oh, okay. 
[00:11:00]  Well, then I'm, uh, John Montone.  I'm backing John Montone.  I'm John Montone.  So have fun kissing each other's asses.  When is this?  In February, I guess.  A couple weeks.  We'll let you know some of the results.  Sure.  Why not?  I'm just surprised.  I'm looking at, like, Best Afternoon Show in New York.  Yeah.  Uh, I didn't even know these guys were on the opposite.  Yeah.  Do you recognize any of the names? 
[00:11:30]  No.  We recognize Wendy Williams because we were told about her recently.  Uh-huh.  And besides that, ah, well, Ken from the Q, Ken, oh, he used to work here, right?  He used to work here.  Okay.  Good.  There you go.  Have fun.  All right.  Enjoy the free meal.  Yes.  It's like a rubber.  The cope.  Mark Coppola for nights at the Q.  Check out Scott Shannon's facelift when you're there.  It's always a treat.  Is he winning an award for that?  Is there an air award for that? 
[00:12:00]  I remember that when we, we did have to go to one air awards in New York the year before  because Scott was running it, and we had a, like, I think we gave out an award for Best  Newscast or something.  Uh-huh.  And someone that did a little newscast about ice cream in the summertime won.  But I remember everyone looking at Scott Shannon's facelifts going, oh, my God, doesn't  even look real anymore.  See, Scott, that's what they were saying behind your back, but no one was brave enough to say  it to your face. 
[00:12:30]  And then the great entertainment that year for the air awards was the Bacon Brothers.  The Bacon Brothers, Anthony.  Kevin Bacon and his brother doing, I don't know what type of music that is.  Is it folk music?  I think it's a little folk.  A little folk music.  There's some folk roots in there.  A little brother where art thou music kind of thing.  A little folk and a little Tenacious D, if I might say.  Were they being funny?  No, but that Tenacious D type style.  It's like, hey, it's Kevin Bacon.  Now I could be in that six degrees of Kevin Bacon only by one degree. 
[00:13:00]  We met him backstage, though.  That was a thrill.  There you go.  Hey, Kevin Bacon.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, I know you.  Corporate show.  Play a few bar chords.  Grab quite a few thousand dollars.  You're a handsome man, Mr. Garrison.  Very good.  So there's a lot of controversy, and quite frankly, we didn't put a tape in for the Arrow Awards.  Next year we will.  We ought to have, you know something?  We should have done this.  We never think. 
[00:13:30]  We could only dream to be as good as the nominees, Anthony.  We should have the audience pick what they feel is probably the worst bit we've done on this show.  Don't do it now, people, because it's too late.  It's too late, and then we'll try to do that for next year.  We should have sent in the Anthony Whiteshorts joke.  Whiteshorts joke, back-to-back with Rick's joke when we were doing the Cribs, Stalker Patty Cribs, the other day.  Have you pulled that clip yet, Rick? 
[00:14:00]  No.  Yeah.  All right, of course not.  I think so.  If it was me or Ann, we would have had it yesterday.  West Coast Dave from San Francisco checking in.  A gay joke in San Francisco.  How original.  All right, Dave.  You know, you live there, okay?  Well, Jim yesterday making rain jokes about Seattle.  Oh, hey.  I really am a hack.  Hey, speaking of Stalker Patty Cribs.  Yeah.  There's video up on FoundryMusic.com.  It's really funny.  What a pro job.  Where's Steve C?  Who did that?  Jeff did that. 
[00:14:30]  Jeff.  He was up all night last night.  I guess he got to bed this morning around 7 a.m.  He just kind of passed out.  But before he did, he called Steve and said it is up.  Jeff does some great work for FoundryMusic.com.  That was a really good job, man.  Oh, awesome.  I had the cribs beginning, the music, the quick cuts, the little fast motion thing they do sometimes.  Really good.  Good job.  The Jeff that puked.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jeff that puked at the strip club in Philly last night.  What a classic he is.  Yeah.  He is so filled with self-hatred.  He's the greatest.  You know what I like?  Somebody that can just ralph from drinking when they're out with the guys and then just 
[00:15:00]  take it right back up again.  We're sitting...  Start pounding him down like it never happened.  He's in the strip club.  He's like, I'm such a loser.  No wonder they don't like me.  I don't have any money.  He was just drunk and miserable.  Oh, he's great.  Yeah, then he fell asleep.  I left already.  I think Open Eye left to have a talk.  Oh.  What?  Did we?  Two men leaving the strip club together.  Yeah.  Have a little talk.  Looks like you enjoyed yourself. 
[00:15:30]  You too.  Care for a little rub in a tub?  Just two men.  He was pointing out all the freaking peep boots and stuff.  Oh, my gosh.  Back to the hotel.  What's wrong with it?  Hey, what's going on?  Two men giving each other the happy ending.  A little hole.  Hey, just getting to know you.  Don't worry.  It'll close right up.  Hey, buddy.  So, Stark and Patty Cribbs.  It looks great.  Yeah.  Oh, you saw it.  Good.  It's a 10-minute video, so, you know, there's guys out there with good systems, and they'll 
[00:16:00]  get to download it and check it out.  I thought it was pretty funny.  Yeah, I am.  I picked off the rough footage to Jeff last night, and he spent all night long putting  the piece together, and he really just studied MTV Cribs and edited it.  Because it looks just like it.  Yeah, it's got the look and feel, the music and everything.  Yeah.  Very good.  Excellent job.  It's a 26-megabyte file, so only those people with the cable modems are going to be able  to get it, probably.  When Patty turns around and looks at Rick and goes, well, this is where the magic happens.  My bed.  The magic. 
[00:16:30]  The cot.  Yeah, where any bit of male excitement disappears into thin air.  Her bed.  The thing, you know, MTV uses these really great shots where they swoop out and do these  really cool zooms, and I really wanted to get some of those, and I was able to get maybe  one or two, but the problem is Patty's room is so friggin' small.  You couldn't even tell you were zooming out.  I crash into the wall every time I zoom out.  So I tripped over the bed.  I tripped over a dresser.  She's got this dresser that looks like she pulled it in off the sidewalk, because the drawers  are all loose and or missing. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  And you trip over the furniture trying to get any kind of decent shot, but I've got  to say, Jeff did an amazing job putting that together.  Yeah, and he makes his little comments on the screen, which is really funny.  Like Patty's telling this little story, and it just says Z across the screen.  He's talking about her bowling trophies, and on the bottom of the screen it says care  with a question mark, and then Z, Z, Z, lots and lots of Z.  So go to foundrymusic.com or opianthony.com to find Stark and Patty Cribs.  Good job, Jeff.  Good job.  All right. 
[00:17:30]  Uh, Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, since you're so original with the city jokes, I'm from Jersey.  You want to ask me what exit?  What exit?  Hey, guys.  Hey, what exit is it?  Because, uh...  Uh, 16W, if you must know.  Well, yeah, someone will remember that from later on the show.  I'm 16E, John.  Oh, that'll be trivia.  All right.  Hey, uh, let's talk to Patty Cribs.  I was almost starting to feel sorry for her.  I was wondering if Mr. Norton could give me a good talking to.  A good what?  You're breaking up, Johnny.  I was wondering if Mr. Norton could give me a good talking to. 
[00:18:00]  A good talking to.  Why do I know that?  I don't know.  See you, guys.  Oh, John.  Oh, poor Uncle John.  Wow.  He's usually our, uh, our ace in the hole there.  Maybe he was in a small room impregnating another man like Rick.  Yes, with white shorts on.  Right.  That was a reference to something.  I know.  Well, Dave, what's up?  We missed it.  Dave!  Oh, my God.  Hey, I think I got a bad cell here.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, Dave, what's going on?  I want to know if Rick's lame attempt at a joke is on that Stalker Patty thing, 
[00:18:30]  because I'll download it just for that.  I think that was edited out.  No, edited out.  It was edited out.  Hold on, hold on.  Steve edited it out, and he put it up as a separate little clip all on its own.  All right.  Bravo.  Bravo to Steve.  That man knows exactly what our audience wants.  Absolutely.  I met you guys at the Year Award show you were at in Boston.  Did you?  Oh, God.  And I was pretty bummed out at how well-behaved you guys were. 
[00:19:00]  I kept waiting for you guys to, like, I don't know, freak out or do something funny,  but you were, like, all well-behaved.  It was such the early days kind of thing.  How many times do we have to tell you guys?  We don't want to be predictable.  Well, you certainly weren't.  After hearing your show all the time and then seeing you in person, it's like, wow, these  are the guys I've been listening to?  Well, we shocked Charles Osgood, I remember.  Yes.  Oh, he was stunned and speechless.  He had no idea what was going on.  Well, I was doing his 10-9 in front of a room full of stiffs. 
[00:19:30]  No one was laughing.  I was laughing really hard on the stage.  Yeah, he went to walk away from the podium and I'm like, thank you, Mr. Cronkite.  And I get nothing.  Oh, he's got a zero?  And then the icing on the cake is when that What's-Her-Name won instead of you guys.  Talk to humanity.  Because radio guys cannot laugh at other radio guys ever, ever, even if it is funny.  Yeah.  Dude, how brutal did that feel, though, doing that little joke at your first award show  and it getting a zero?  Oh, it was brutal.  But then he decided, you know, to try even harder and he did the whole Ted Knight speech 
[00:20:00]  about the small, uh...  It all started for me.  Right.  And that's such a classic line.  How could anybody not laugh at that?  It's so good.  That's the fuck.  You ever had that happen, you know what?  For 20 minutes and a clip, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I've died for a length.  Yeah, when he's talking about the Golden Girls.  All right, Dave, thank you.  All right, see you guys.  Bye.  How was the song last night?  The crowd pretty much hated my guts.  You know, I kind of forced a few laughs out of them, but it was pretty much like that.  It happened, so what?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  You move on. 
[00:20:30]  Okay.  Tim, what's going on?  Guys, how we doing?  Good.  On a spin from MTV Cribs with Mariah Carey.  Anthony, are you going to start calling up for the last interview before she kills herself?  Yeah.  What do you think?  Mariah kills herself?  She'll be gone by the end of the year.  How bad is it that you're paid not to make any records?  She's asked.  Don't make any records.  We are going to give you this much money so you stop recording records with our company.  Yeah.  One of them said $28 million, but somebody said $50 million. 
[00:21:00]  I think it was close to $30 million, right?  $29 million.  $29 million, $30 million.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, guys.  Start calling.  I'll record it.  All right.  Thanks.  Later.  It shows you a scumbag's record company.  I don't even like Mariah Carey, but she's giving them so many hits that she has one bomb and  they drop her.  You know, we actually got paid once to not perform at a small gin mill dump out on Long  Island.  Supposed to be the band, you know, me and my brother and the rest of the band are going  to play.  A couple of the guys couldn't show up. 
[00:21:30]  So we decided, look, still got Joe with the guitar.  We'll do some parody stuff.  We'll just improv some crap.  Adam Ferrara, who's a huge stand-up comic now.  He's on the job on ABC.  Thank you for that wow sticker, Adam.  We'll talk about that.  We all started on the job last night.  It's going to be featured on every episode of the job.  Great job.  He's such a friend of the show, man.  We decided to do that.  Halfway through doing it, the club owner comes up and goes, look, I'll pay you for the night.  Just, you know, put the jukebox on because these people ain't digging what you're doing. 
[00:22:00]  I'm like, oh.  And there it is.  You know, me from the Opie and Anthony show, Adam Ferrara, Brother Joe doing stuff.  And it's just a low-life gin mill out on Long Island.  I can beat you and you know the story, Anthony.  Which one?  You've got to help me out with the place.  We had a good old boy.  Remember the place on the South Shore?  The Robbie Krieger story?  What place was it?  Christopher's.  Christopher's, right? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  When I was working at BAB on Long Island, I had to do one of these gigs where, you know,  I go to the bar and throw out my T-shirts and stuff.  And Robbie Krieger was performing of The Doors.  Legend.  Legend.  Just him and his guitar just doing the riffs and stuff, you know.  And the place, seriously, how big?  Very small.  Maybe get 150 people in there.  If you squeeze them in.  Picture one of your local bars in your small, you know, medium-sized towns in the suburbs, 
[00:23:00]  anywhere in the country.  That's what this place is.  I thought it was so cool.  I'm sitting there.  There's Robbie Krieger, 20 feet from me.  Huge Doors fan growing up and stuff.  I couldn't believe I'm seeing Robbie Krieger.  And he's jamming all the riffs from all the classic Doors songs and stuff.  He's got a backup band, you know.  I don't remember if he had a singer.  I don't think he did.  I think it was more like just instrumental.  He was jamming.  He was completely jamming.  I was enjoying it, right?  The Islanders were on.  And trust me, this was...  I mean, the Islanders are doing much better these days. 
[00:23:30]  But, I mean, the Islanders weren't even a good team.  Not even an issue, right?  But they're on the tube and the game's going well.  People are yelling and screaming every time the Islanders, you know, either scored a goal  or there was a great play on the tube.  They start yelling to the owner to turn up the volume on the Islander game.  They did not want to listen to Robbie Krieger.  They would rather watch the Islander game.  Not watch a legend of rock music performance. 
[00:24:00]  It was cringe all the way.  You know, I probably wouldn't want to listen to it either.  The guy was just dying in front of 150 people in just, you know, this little bar on the south shore of Long Island.  Ouch.  Hey, at least it wasn't you, though.  We've all had our moments on stage.  Oof.  Somebody's saying, how do you think Voss pays his rent?  People pay him to not perform.  That didn't take long today.  All right, we have lots to do, so why don't we take our first break? 
[00:24:30]  We've got to talk about John Walker.  Yeah.  Ah.  And his parents.  His dopey, delusional, raised-a-traitor parents.  And we've got that 80s show audio clips.  It's a portable phone.  We're done with that commercial now, right?  Yes.  It aired last night.  Yes.  So you shan't be hearing that commercial again.  We got a sampling of some of the bad lines from the show last night.  Oh, great.  We were goofing on it all day yesterday.  Yeah.  And don't forget Boston.  We're giving away that trip to see the Patriots versus the Steelers Sunday, courtesy of WBCN. 
[00:25:00]  A little later on, we're going to have Scott Farrell, the guy you hate.  Yeah.  He makes fun of you and your town.  He'll call in, and he'll give away the trip for us.  Okay?  Cool.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:25:30]  Lots of instant feedback today, Anthony.  We were talking about some of our bad bits and our worst shows and stuff.  So now, will you shut up?  Oh, my God.  He's talking into the mic again.  What were you saying?  No one heard you.  Nice to be here.  How are you?  Oh, my God.  You're in the middle of saying something, and he's like, nice to be here.  How are you?  Go ahead.  Here's exactly what happens.  Go ahead.  Nice to be here.  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  I'm stammering now.  Great to be here.  Or how about when he does this?  So, Anthony...  Rick, did you get that water?  Where'd you get that?  What?  You want to go to an island again?  What?  What?  I didn't say that.  You have nothing, do you?  Nothing.  Why?  Say something that our listeners want to hear right now.  God.  Are you picking on me?  Please.  Stinky owes me $125.  Make a monkey fly a fighter jet.  No? 
[00:26:30]  Why are you going to do this to me?  You're just so nice to me.  As soon as you go to break, he's not picking on me.  Annoying laugh, Anthony.  The limo guy is here in the studio for some reason.  And he'll just start...  And you will hear him just start babbling in the background.  He can't help himself.  Yeah, he can't.  He's got like Tourette's.  Even after we point it out, he'll still do it.  Guaranteed.  Where's Frenchy when you need him?  Oh, Frenchy will call him.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Die.  Die.  Get in the coffin.  Die, you stupid twat. 
[00:27:00]  Stupid limo driver.  You add nothing to the show.  Stupid limo, stupid.  Stupid right now.  Stupid bus driver.  The guy's great when he just gets on a roll bashing people.  You go drive your bus, you idiot.  You stupid bus driving twat.  Die.  Get in the coffin.  Why don't you die?  And you know we didn't want to make Frenchy a star.  We're making him a star now.  Hey, come on.  Funny's funny.  It's funny's funny. 
[00:27:30]  Quick stop from Levitown writes, worst show ever, guys?  Yeah.  Balloon Boy.  Oh.  Yeah, okay.  Absolutely.  End of discussion.  Remember Balloon Boy?  He was on Boot Camp, that reality show.  The kid from Jersey.  Kid from Jersey.  He came in and made balloon animals.  Dude.  So bad.  Oh, God.  Did that suck.  He sat here and he made things out of balloons for three hours.  And we didn't know how to.  We couldn't even get out of that hole.  We didn't know how to get out of it, man. 
[00:28:00]  Did he put like a little.  And it's a dog.  And a little.  Yeah.  A little sounds.  Look.  It's a giraffe.  Ooh.  Giraffe.  You know when balloons are interesting?  When you can make a hole with hair on it.  That's when a balloon is interesting.  If you can't do that, stop making balloon things.  They suck.  Frenchy.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Limo Anthony's here.  Limo Anthony.  That's fun.  You bastard.  Frenchy.  You're effing tall.  I know.  You twat.  Thank you. 
[00:28:30]  Here we go.  Here we go.  Huh?  Frenchy, when are you coming in here?  So I bust your head in?  Come and visit.  Your whole bag.  I can't wait.  Come on.  You just got a big pussy hanging out of your pants.  Frenchy, come in.  You pants, you whole bag.  Just come in here, please.  You didn't kill yourself in your goddamn limousine pants?

Come into the studio, Frenchy, please.  I'll be there soon.  Don't you worry about that.  Thank you, baby.  All right.  See you, Frenchy.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Frenchy.  Hey, Norton, you rule.  Bye.  Thank you, sir.  All right, take it easy.  Bye, Frenchy.  All right, bye.  Hilarious.  God, nothing more degrading, first of all, than having a French guy just rip you apart. 
[00:30:00]  You had nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Michelle.  The whole country of the world had surrendered, and he ripped you apart.  What's up today, Michelle?  Nothing.  I just want to know if you guys saw the wow sticker on the job last night.  Oh, my God.  Right when the job started, the show, Dennis Leary's show on ABC.  We'll give him the plug.  Wednesday night.  9.30.  9.30.  Dennis Leary's coming in next week.  Yeah.  It was the opening shot, and it's got Adam at the desk. 
[00:30:30]  Every time they showed the squad room, we saw it.  Adam at the desk, and then Dennis Leary's sitting in one of the chairs, and right between  the two of them, big, bright wow that Adam put up there.  Yeah, it's our wow bumper sticker.  I guess they had a blackout O.P. and Anthony in the radio station, but...  Yeah, he's like, they wouldn't let me keep the station on there.  Yeah, you couldn't see L&A or anything.  You just saw a wow.  It doesn't matter.  We know it's ours, and it's cool as hell.  It's going to be on every episode, Adam was telling us.  It was great.  My pal. 
[00:31:00]  That's a pal taking care of his friends.  That's right.  All right, Michelle.  All right, thanks.  Thank you.  Bye.  So, John Walker's back in the United States.  Oh, thank God.  The rock star has arrived, the way they're treating this prick.  That poor kid.  Why doesn't he die?  That's her.  We told you he'd be a rock star.  He's a rock star.  He's a goddamn phenomenon.  A rock star.  And he's going to go on trial here. 
[00:31:30]  They're going to portray him as the poor, misled youth.  He'll do some time, but you know something?  He'll get out because he's a kid, and he'll become rich and famous.  No way?  Book deals.  Oh, God, of course.  You are stupid.  No.  You ain't a million.  No.  How long do you think he'll get?  Even if he gets life, they will let that mother effer out in even, let's say, 20 years.  How old will he be?  41?  Plenty of time. 
[00:32:00]  Enjoy the wealth he'll rake in.  He won't get out of the gym.  You think so?  No way.  All right.  Who are you?  No, I'm just saying.  And what's going to happen to him?  Come on, man.  Da, da, da, da.  Da, da, da, da.  Da, da, da, da.  He might get the Oz theme.  Life without parole.  You don't know that.  He might get life without parole, man.  People really, really don't like this kid.  Yeah, yeah.  He very well might get life without parole.  You know what, though?  The guy's a goddamn rock star.  I could see it already, too. 
[00:32:30]  You stupid effing bitches.  They will be writing him letters.  Let me tell you something.  I might not agree with what you did, but you're so cute.  I want to come visit yeet.  Happens every time.  Joey, Casey had frigging fans.  I know.  I like that.  It's encouraging, though.  It's encouraging.  Yeah, how many letters did you send him, you freak?  Richard Ramirez, the night stalker, was getting marriage proposals in jail after he bashed 80-year-old women's heads into a lamp. 
[00:33:00]  Uh-huh.  You know who else?  That goddamn, what's his name?  Bundy down in Florida.  Yep.  That son of a bitch had women like he was the goddamn backstreet boy.  Married while he was going through that trial.  Like he was the backstreet boy.  Excuse me.  He cut girls' heads off.  Hello.  Hello, ladies.  You got to get past that part.  It's the woman that makes the man. 
[00:33:30]  A bunch of rube, stupid who.  He was.  He was.  Tyson?  Where did he get his wife that he's just divorcing?  Married in jail.  Well, he was in there for rape.  And she married this guy.  Now, that you might think might be for money.  No, she was a doctor, I think.  She has money.  I mean, not Tyson money, but she has money.  She's not gross.  She'd fix her own wounds when he clocks her in the head.  Remember what he said about Robin Givens when he punched her in the face? 
[00:34:00]  One of the best punches I ever thrown.  I ever throated.  Throated.  So, we got some audio clips of John Walker's dad and mom.  Yeah, the parents, another couple of despicable people.  The mother said she's unconditional love for her son.  And you know something, though?  There's a point where you just...  Where did it go wrong?  Don't try to BS us.  You could have whatever delusions in your own head you want,  but you could tell they wrote these statements with a lawyer. 
[00:34:30]  They're not just going to pop on the news and make a statement.  It was written and crafted by lawyers and PR people  that would put them and their kid in the best light.  And all it did when I heard these quotes was infuriate me.  Infuriate me.  Someone wants to state the obvious.  We know this already, but hey, what's up?  Radek?  Yeah.  What's up?  No, and if John Walker goes to jail, he loses his right.  He loses his right to sell it. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, in jail.  Once he gets out, fair game.  What if they make the movie before it?  While he's in jail.  In this country, even after.  Oh, even after?  I think so.  It's illegal.  I don't know.  I might think that is not right because you've already paid your debt to society.  Maybe you're right.  So I don't think that's true.  And the parents can rake in a lot of money.  Believe me.  The parents will be set.  There'll be a whole movie about him and his upbringing.  How he was brainwashed by the Taliban. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Before he went over there.  He made the decision to go over there.  He should just be beaten and sodomized.  Yeah.  Well, it ain't going to happen.  The guy's going to go through a trial.  His scum lawyers are going to twist and turn this every which way to make him the victim.  He's the victim.  You see his little fat.  He looks like Robbie Alomar in that picture.  Look at him.  They shaved his head and took his beard off.  All right.  Well, here's John Walker's dad.  Yeah.  Here's the father.  We were troubled to find out that he did not get medical treatment until he was transferred  to the U.S. Navy ship. 
[00:36:00]  He did not have medical treatment at Camp Rhino.  But John is in good condition this morning.  John loves America.  All right.  Okay.  That's the part.  While I was driving in, I freaked out when I heard that one.  John loves America.  No, he doesn't.  Right.  A bull-ass us.  He's fighting against America.  You can say it.  The guy is saying John loves America.  He is insulting every person in this country by trying to lie and think we're going to buy 
[00:36:30]  it that his son loves this country.  He does not.  He was working with people that hate this country, want it wiped off the face of this  planet, want everybody that lives here and enjoys what you can get out of this country  dead.  And then he comes back and gets a fair treatment, which he doesn't even deserve.  But, hey, it is America.  Go ahead.  What are you going to say?  And then he pumps out a statement like that. 
[00:37:00]  Eat me.  John loves America.  We love America.  John did not do anything against America.  John did not take up arms against America.  He never meant to harm any American.  And he never did harm any American.  Right.  So why was he over there?  Was he on vacation?  Vacationing in a compound.  Did they have a club med over there?  That was full of people that were shooting at American soldiers?  Others, this is how this trial is going to go. 
[00:37:30]  They're going to twist and turn this and make him the victim.  Oh, my God.  They brainwashed him.  They did this, that, the other thing.  How about the parent questioning this loser, son of a bitch, when his buddies decided they  were going to come up and shoot him?  Shut up.  See?  No, I mean...  What is that about?  Just because he's on a roll right now and he's pissed.  Yeah, so how about you don't...  He's pissed.  Interrupt.  I'm sorry.  You see anyone else talking? 
[00:38:00]  See, here he...  Oh, and you just shut up and listen to him.  Here he goes.  Did I explain this perfectly?  If it was anyone else, we'd be like, what are they doing?  Why would you say...  You're completely expected out of this guy.  He cannot help himself.  He has to speak up.  You're the job.  He's pissed.  You want to be in?  You want to rub his back?  No.  No.  Goodbye.  See that?  It was the fake goodbye where he took the headphones off and then put them right back  on.  Just try to be quiet.  We do like you.  You won't even be in the studio.  He has these outbursts that he can't control. 
[00:38:30]  You've got this weird Tourette's.  Like a child.  It's Tourette's.  It's some kind of weird...  Idiot Tourette's.  Let me go.  And can I say that that father sounds like a real namby-pamby little bag of a puke?  Well, he didn't have enough balls to raise a kid like that.  Exactly.  You know, let his little artistic thing come out.  Let him do what he wants.  And that's what he does.  Scumbag.  Bad father.  Glad your son's a bum.  Bad father.  Bad mother.  You failed. 
[00:39:00]  They live in a very, very exclusive neighborhood.  Considered very liberal.  Of course.  What a shock.  Neighborhood.  Yeah.  And just like you said, I can just picture this.  The kid, find myself, I'm going to go overseas and, you know, learn about other cultures and  help people and blah, blah, blah.  Next thing you know, the troops are coming in and his buddies are shooting at Americans  and God knows what this scumbag was doing.  All right.  This guy, Corey, has something.  Corey, what's up? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  John Walker said that he went over there because when he was 16, when his parents got divorced,  his dad left his mom for another man and the Taliban are strictly against gays.  Oh, that's it.  They'll use that, too.  So if daddy's a homo, it's perfectly fine to take up arms against his dad.  Is his dad left to drink out of mules?  Ah-ha.  Ah-ha.  Oh, that's so great.  Is that really true, Corey?  Somebody just said that. 
[00:40:00]  Do you know John Walker's dad left his family to live with his gay lover?  Oh, boy, that mother should hang herself.  What an absolute bar.  You turned your husband off of women.  Can you keep any man happy?  And you turned your son into a self-hating, country-hating...  You turned your son against America.  Against the whole country.  Just because it has the word country in it.  Ah-ha.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, what a...  Turn him against country and his father against the same thing.  Wow. 
[00:40:30]  Without the tree.  Wow.  What a little nudge pig so much thing.  Oh, God.  Hey, we just found our funny minute for the Arrow Wars.  There you go.  There it is.  That'll be next year's winner.  Submit it.  Do you know what a nag you have to be for your husband to go,  I can't take this.  Why?  You failure whore.  You'd rather have man juice than have to listen to that ragging, nagging.  That is... 
[00:41:00]  And it does come down to parenting, too.  Don't let anybody kid you.  You're 16 years old.  You're awful parents.  Have some balls.  All right, let's hear the rest of his dad here.  John is innocent of these charges.  Oh, that was it.  John is innocent of these charges.  How do you know?  Let's hear the mom now.  Ugh.  Ready for the mom?  Here we go.  John Walker's mom.  It's been two years since I last saw my son.  It was wonderful to see him this morning.  My love for him is unconditional and absolute. 
[00:41:30]  And I'm grateful to God that he has been brought home to his family.  Yeah.  Me, his home, his country.  Oh, don't even say that.  His country.  How about the mothers that have to welcome their kids back in body bags coming from overseas fighting?  How about that?  How about the mothers that don't get to see their kids anymore?  Because of this scumbag and the likes of him over there. 
[00:42:00]  How do you even use the word his country to defend this prick?  Despicable.  Turned your husband into a sea sucker, you slob.  But you got the right administration around right now.  Rumsfeld.  That ain't good.  It's just drivel.  It's babble.  That's what they hear from this woman.  If it was like a nice, cushy, liberal, you know, we got to think and consider the circumstances. 
[00:42:30]  No.  Awful.  All right.  We got some John Ashcroft audio, Anthony.  Talking to the father, I think.  Howdy.  Faggot.  That wasn't Ashcroft?  Wow.  No?  Oh, here's Ashcroft, uh, talking to the father.  You're a girl.  No?  God.  All right.  If you want to go down this road.  I got about 50 of them on this road. 
[00:43:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, we got Ashcroft here now.  Okay.  Friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something?  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the hands, fellas.  Oh, there you have it.  Oh, that's good.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  What an exclusive.  John Walker's father's first words to his son when he saw him for the first time.  Oh, good. 
[00:43:30]  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Who saw that coming?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  And that's John Walker's father on what he hates more.  I was against his son.  Hussah!  Oh, brother.  All right.  Well, Camel Toe wants in here. 
[00:44:00]  Camel Toe, what's up?  What up, dog?  What up, dog?  D-O-J-J.  D-O-W-J.  John Walker's father is a traitor of the vag.  Whatever.  Oh, remember.  Never been.  Very good.  I guess they caught John Walker on the phone late at night.  He might have had company.  This is all he said.  Ah!  Ouch.  It's supposed to be sexy. 
[00:44:30]  I wish we'd actually got the tape of him.  I got some audio of John Walker's dad.  Great.  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  Sounds a little personal.  All right.  All right.  On your knees.  Yeah.  All right.  Can I play the clip?  So do we actually have it of what?  John Ashcroft or?  John Ashcroft.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can play that for you. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  All right.  Thank God.  Yeah, no.  Do we have it?  Yeah, for real.  Ooh.  We do hard news on this show.  We got to play it.  Yeah.  All right.  John Ashcroft.  And the complaint alleges that Walker knowingly and purposefully allied himself with terror.  That he chose to embrace fanatics and his allegiance to them never faltered.  Not with the knowledge that they had murdered thousands of his countrymen. 
[00:45:30]  Not with the knowledge that they were engaged in a war with the United States.  And not finally in the prison uprising that took the life of CIA agent Johnny Spann.  Yeah.  Johnny Spann's parents ain't going to see him.  Charles, what's up?  Yo, Anthony, lighten up, man.  I mean, it's still America.  You know, innocent until proven guilty.  You know.  Stop it.  Why?  Just stop it.  How dare you tell me to stop it? 
[00:46:00]  This country allows us to go through the judicial system to prove this man is guilty.  You know what?  That's a great thing.  Innocent until proven guilty.  Fine.  As far as the law goes, yes.  And you're a racist.  But we all know how that works.  No, he's not.  Well, okay, Charles.  I will agree with that.  Jackass.  What happened with Otto and George?  They sold you out this morning.  I thought they were exclusively dedicated to you guys.  What happened with them?  Oh, is he trying to get to us?  No. 
[00:46:30]  Charles, what are you cursing for?  Why can't he just talk in his normal voice?  I don't know.  Because he thinks he's doing something.  He thinks he's a...  Twilly guy toss.  Ow.  Oh, that hurt.  That really hurt.  Hey.  Look what I did to them.  I got a tape of the click.  Another click from John Ashcroft there. 
[00:47:00]  On each of the crossroads, Walker faced a choice.  And with each choice, he chose to...  There you go.  Mitch, what's going on?  How much?  Oh, hey, listen.  What did you say?  This guy treated with Osama bin Laden.  He was in the same camp as bin Laden.  This guy is a modern.  He's a proud American.  What, are you crazy?  He loves his country.  His parents said so.  You know what?  What did he say in that camp to convince bin Laden not to take him out? 
[00:47:30]  Bin Laden hates America more than anyone in this entire world.  People, I think that he was saying that he was from Ireland.  Oh, is that what he said?  That's what I read.  He lied to the Taliban?  Well, now I am angry at him.  I can't wait for John Walker to go to jail, my friend.  Well, I'm going to have a new a-hole over there.  A long, annoying trial is what it's going to be.  A very annoying one.  We're going to hear stuff that pisses us off.  Do you have the lawyer's comment?  We need the lawyer's comment.  That was ridiculous.  I'm bummed that he came back into this country not in a body bag. 
[00:48:00]  Briefly, what the lawyer said was, he said, this country, you're innocent until proven guilty.  He goes, that is in a document that was written right here in Virginia many years ago by men who made this country.  And I'm listening to that driving in.  I almost hit a goddamn pole for the third time because I'm thinking to myself, yeah, the men that wrote that document, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, all that fun stuff that was written. 
[00:48:30]  If you were cohorting with the British back then, what would have happened?  You would have been hung.  You're hanging from a goddamn street pole.  And kids would have thrown rocks at you and stuff.  They hung you.  If you were a traitor and you were collaborating with the enemy, which was the British at the time, you were hung. 
[00:49:00]  He was coming back to this.  Oh, my God.  He was coming here to kill people.  He was coming here to kill people.  That's the bottom line.  They were training him to come back to kill people.  I heard that they asked him to come to the U.S.  and he said no.  Oh, my God.  Dude, you're out of your mind.  Will you just shut up?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's like an episode of Crossfire with an orangutan in it. 
[00:49:30]  He can't help himself.  He really can't.  God love him.  He was coming here to kill people.  I told you exactly what was going to happen with him.  That's why I keep your mic nice and loud.  Because, I mean, if you really listen close at home, ladies and gentlemen, you'll hear him mumbling in the background.  You're right.  Most of the time, we just cover it up.  But you'll hear him just go, well, you know, that's right.  You don't have to move.  Hey, you want tickets to the Islanders Rangers next Wednesday? 
[00:50:00]  Frank, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I think I've found sympathy for John Walker.  Yeah?  Well, if I walked in on my dad giving another guy the whale, I'd join the Taliban, too.  Right?  What's the worst thing I could possibly do to get back at my father?  I'm going to go against the entire country.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  It's like...  Give the guy the whale.  Anthony, it's like Daddy loved me.  Right, exactly. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  Do we have another clip of John Ashcroft?  Here we go.  Walker was blessed to grow up in a country that cherishes freedom.  Freedom of speech.  Religious tolerance, political democracy, quality between men and women.  Men and men.  And yet he chose to reject those values in favor of their antithesis.  A regime that publicly and proudly advertised its mission to extinguish freedom, to enslave women, to deny education. 
[00:51:00]  I like that part.  John Walker-Lynn chose to fight with the Taliban, to train with al-Qaeda, and to be led by Kusama bin Laden.  There you go.  And one more clip from Ashcroft.  Now, our complaint is clear.  John Walker chose to join terrorists who wanted to kill Americans.  And he chose to waive his right to an attorney, both orally and in writing, before his statement to the FBI. 
[00:51:30]  Mr. Walker will be held responsible in the courtroom for his choices.  Courtroom.  There you go.  He wasn't given medical attention at Camp Rhino.  Poor baby.  He should have been with an M-16.  Yeah.  Right his mouth.  They shaved him all up.  Shaved his head.  They're going to bring him into the court like he's the victim. 
[00:52:00]  Poor guy.  Blah, blah, blah.  I'm sure the defense, when they pick a jury, they're going to pick a bunch of dopey girls that are just going to swoon.  And I just hope they have more sense than goddamn OJ's jury.  I'll tell you that much.  The pain of mouth is the victim.  The country is the victim.  This guy, you know, watch the videotapes. 
[00:52:30]  Pull them out again.  Get on the web.  Watch the planes fly into the building.  Watch them crash down.  Watch the firefighters and cops and EMS and all the people that were working die.  People on the planes dead.  Body parts.  All that stuff.  Watch it.  The second you feel an inkling of sympathy because of the lies that the defense attorneys tell you, pop those up.  They're all over the web. 
[00:53:00]  Get a little reminder of what this scumbag is all about and who he was hanging with.  Not for a second, forget about that.  Thank you.  All right.  We've got to get girls in here for the Naughty Nighty contest.  Bring on the nudes.  We're really looking stupid now.  New York, you're letting us down.  We've got four girls representing so far.  Come on.  That's pathetic.  We've got a trip to Hedonism 3.  We've got Cold Heart Cash for second and third place.  And we're going to sweeten up the prizes with other things.  Ladies, if you're in the New York area between now and 7, stop by with your Naughty Nighty. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  We're really nice in person.  We'll take some fine photographs and we'll put them up on the web for everyone to check out.  Okay.  Great prize.  Great prize.  How about, do we have any incentive prize for today?  I usually get some girls down here.  Anything?  Did you hear that in the background?  What?  A limo.  Limo.  Limo.  Did you hear that in the background?  Limo.  Did you hear them?  What did you say?  A limo.  I said a limo.  He looked at...  Limo.  Limo. 
[00:54:00]  Limo.  And what do they do with this limo?  Drive around a little bit?  They need it.  Pick up people for you?  If you want to.  Maybe they can stand up and put their heads out the roof and wave.  Hey, look at me.  I'm in a limo.  Limo.  Hey.  It just happens to be shaped like a bus.  Dress in your best prom wear.  Stand out of the top of the limo.  Hopefully it hits a pole and you get severed in two.  Oh, dude.  What was that Gene Hackman movie?  You know what I like about you?  You're tall.  Oh, yeah.  You're standing on top of the train at the end and their head smashes into that little 
[00:54:30]  concrete bridge.  Always great.  Also, Anthony, for Boston today, we've got a trip for two to see the Patriots versus  the Steelers Sunday, courtesy of WBCN.  We're trying to find Scott Farrell.  He really pissed off Boston the other day.  And as soon as we find him, he's going to get on the air with us.  He'll mess with Boston again today.  And then he's got a good idea to give away the trip.  Okay?  Yeah.  All right.  So stick around for that, Boston.  Dazzle Opie and Anthony with your brilliance now. 
[00:55:00]  In New York, call 877-692-1027.  Nationally, 866-277-4-WOW.  Opie and Anthony.  And E.  Yeah, this is the Opie and Anthony show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4-WOW.  We're trying to get Scott Farrell on the line so we give away that trip. 
[00:55:30]  Mac from Jersey liked my segue.  He goes, hey, Ann, I like your segue.  Remember what happened on September 11th.  Then where are the nude girls?  That's what this show's all about, man.  We kind of bounce around a bit.  We have to balance it out.  We take extremes.  We go one way and then we're right back to business as usual.  Get the nudes.  After that rant, we need a girl and a wiffle ball bat now.  Right.  Isn't that what America's all about?  Look at Louis Black. 
[00:56:00]  Louis Black in the studio.  How are we doing?  Very well.  He was supposed to be here for our John Walker rant, but he was stuck downstairs with security.  Yep.  They're good.  They're good.  Keeping them away from you guys.  There was a flock of people.  Has any of the bars made the drinks yet?  The traitor drinks where, you know, Johnny Walker's in there.  Little Johnny Walker Black.  And then you put some other stuff in there and it's called the traitor.  Or something.  I'm sure. 
[00:56:30]  This is a guy who probably, you know, this is a guy who should have been on a bowling team and things went awry.  And things went a little amiss.  Well, that's what he wanted.  He wanted to join a club.  Why can't he be an ordinary kid and shoot up a high school or something?  You know?  It's a lot worse than that.  He's got to go crazy.  We're learning that he, John Walker's dad left his mom because he wanted to live with his gay lover.  And that'll do it to you.  And that sent John Walker over the edge, my friend.  That'll do it to you.  That's the thing that really sends you.  Send the kid a little crazy?  That's the thing that sends you to live in a cave. 
[00:57:00]  You know, that's the first thought I have.  Yeah.  You know?  Your father wants to suck on a C.  You gotta, I don't know, go to a desert country and start shooting at Americans.  Why don't you just take it like a man, sit back, whack your bag, and watch?  Louie, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  No, and I'm going under that bridge right now in Hoboken, man.  I'm going to be in the Lincoln Tunnel in five minutes.  And we care why?  Oh, you'll care because I'm bringing my girl down for the Naughty Nighty contest. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah!  Oh, okay.  All right.  It worked out in my favor.  I'm like, oh, man, I hope no girls come down.  It's kind of, you know, be, you know, and they're not expecting anybody.  Here we come.  It's a little slow today with the Naughty Nighty contest, and Louis Black is here.  I'm sure he would love to see someone.  Yeah, I'd love to meet Louis Black and Orton, man.  I love it.  I'm on my way.  I'll be there probably like a half an hour atop.  I'm getting to the Lincoln Tunnel in a minute.  Don't make us take pictures of Louis Black in his Naughty Nighty.  Drive safe, sir. 
[00:58:00]  Godspeed.  Hey, we got clips of that 80s show.  Ah.  Why?  Thank God we didn't have to hear the commercial anymore.  Why doesn't Louis have a sitcom?  Because these are important times.  The 80s were really important times.  To live through it once is disgusting.  But to actually recycle it.  It's like recycling.  It would be like doing a show on the horrors of Vietnam, basically.  But you know something?  It's done very badly. 
[00:58:30]  It's not even...  I know.  From what I saw, I swear I could not get through three minutes of this show.  Stinky put the tape in in the office and hit play and I'm watching going, I don't understand this.  They're saying lines and then there's canned laughs just busting in at the end of the line.  And I'm like, what did they just...  It wasn't the least bit funny.  I wouldn't even bring myself...  Well, I mean, they ran the ads about a billion times. 
[00:59:00]  A billion times.  It's a portable phone!  And then I saw later the two guys at a bar talking on those jumbo walls.  Right.  And that really...  That's when I said, God, I hope I'm home on that night.  Yeah.  I really got to check that.  I didn't want to see that.  You know?  Some guy on the messaging board raised a brilliant point.  It was either Irish Alky or Ikea Boy.  How characters, like in 70s shows, about the 70s, are characters in a 70s setting.  But characters, like in 80s shows, are just characters specifically put there to crack little 80s jokes. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  It's like there's nothing real about them.  It was a great point.  That's all it is.  That 70s show is funny.  I never saw it.  It's a funny goddamn show.  It really is.  If you were in the 70s and you were high, high school, hanging out...  That show is a great actor.  The guy, the one who plays his name, I can't think of his name.  Very good.  He's a very funny guy.  That show's funny.  But that's insane.  But for us to be sitting here talking about the 70s shows being this... 
[01:00:00]  Now, that's like Faulkner.  Yeah, I'm funny.  You know?  That's James Joyce.  Don't push it.  I said it was funny.  I'm Faulkner.  No, but Schmucky the Clown.  It's not really Schmucky.  It's...  You know, I know.  I understand.  But it's still like...  We're reduced to that.  Well, hey.  Emeril Lagasse got a little sitcom there for us five minutes.  Yeah, let's discuss that.  For five minutes.  Yeah, that was gone.  And everybody knew.  The only guy I want to see cooking and laughing about it is Dahmer.  That's the only one I can enjoy watching cook. 
[01:00:30]  Cooking is never funny.  What?  How much parsley are you going to use?  Oh, that's a spicy little dish.  I give credit to the public for tuning that out.  I got to give you credit.  Well, let's take a listen, huh?  All right.  Let's hear some of the comedy of that 80s show.  We have like 20 clips.  We'll just play.  Oh, my God.  We'll make our point really fast here with maybe four or five. 
[01:01:00]  We'll play it until every person here in the studio falls asleep.  All right, here we go.  And then someone will hit a button.  Listen to this clip from that 80s show.  She's not a lesbian.  She's bisexual.  She's like a vegetarian who likes turkey every now and then.  I've heard worse than that, man.  Yeah, but that laugh?  Awful.  A vegetarian who likes turkey?  Why is that a funny line? 
[01:01:30]  I don't say it was a funny line.  I've heard worse.  But the problem I have, it was no one talks like that in real life.  Me and Lewis would never have that.  You know, she's like this, and he paws.  Uh-oh, funny part coming.  Ah, here it comes.  That's the problem with sitcoms.  They're all like set up in punchline, and nobody talks like that, you faggot, stupid writers.  Get older writers.  Where's Norman Lear?  They're all 30 years old, pseudo-hipsters with little sweaters, you know, just a little too brilliant to fix my hair, man.  All wearing little John Lennon glasses, man, you know. 
[01:02:00]  Chill.  Lois Black has to meet with those people right after the show.  Well, I'm saying it.  Adam, let's go.  I'll never get a sitcom.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Adam.  I want to make a comment about that 80s show.  All right.  I'd rather let Tyson F me till I loved him than watch that show again.  All right.  Wow.  Good job, Adam.  Wow.  Well, check out this clip.  Yeah, good.  Embarrassed to be seen with you.  Embarrassed to be seen with you.  What happened to you?  What happened to you?  What happened to you?  What happened to you?  What happened to you?  What happened to you? 
[01:02:30]  Best friends.  Best friends.  What guys talk like that?  Embarrassed to be seen.  None.  What guys have you ever spoken to, best friends?  Never.  Never.  But why is everyone laughing?  They're not.  That's spider monkeys.  Maybe they fed the mescaline and tickled them.  There's nothing funny.  Spider monkeys.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man? 
[01:03:00]  So that show might be a little bit funnier if they didn't have Rich Boss writing all the lines, Frank.  He's not even here.  They're not going to struggle.  Michael, it's a dryer door.  I owe Michael milk and money for junk bonds and I'm dodging them. 
[01:03:30]  Black guys don't eat the coochie unless it's fried.  He doesn't even have to be here.  Alex, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's up?  I just want to say the one joke that I waited for all night long was, hey, it's a portable phone.  And that was because you guys made it funny.  But then he killed the whole joke when he says, here are the eyes, and he shakes them in the background. 
[01:04:00]  Are you in a small room with Steve C.?  No, he's just explaining.  I got to defend this guy.  That wasn't his line.  I hear it.  All right, Alex, thanks.  I hear it.  All right, here's another clip from that 80s show.  My mom stopped telling me what to do when I was 17.  Of course, I was living with Jim Morrison.  Why is that funny?  They were pumping nitrous in or something.  Maybe, like you said, giving them mescaline. 
[01:04:30]  And tickling the nitrous.  Tickling.  That's not a real audience, though, is it?  No.  It couldn't be.  Absolutely not.  No, that's, yeah.  We're saying that, and it'll come back to haunt us.  Let's put it this way.  Even Lin-Manuel is not laughing.  Is it?  Is that a live audience?  It might be, actually.  You never know.  You never know anymore.  But they may dub it and laugh.  Sometimes they have comics or whatever.  You know, they have warm-ups.  Yeah.  I mean, from what I've heard on sitcom sets.  Oh, and they get them to laugh.  And then they'll sometimes use the...  Oh, and sweeten it up.  Yeah.  I'm not saying that's what they're doing.  They may have real audiences. 
[01:05:00]  And then sometimes they actually give enemas to donkeys.  And when they bray, their braying is used in the background.  You can hear it.  But it's really not juicy.  And then you're...  And then you actually hear the...  The little...  I can't make the noise.  I'm trying to do you now.  I can't even make the noise.  I'm pathetic.  I am pathetic.  I had a bunch of...  It's not your job to make the noises, Lois.  But it was sad.  I've been to watch.  I'm trying to laugh here. 
[01:05:30]  More clips, please.  Yeah, please.  Okay, here's another one.  So when you go to the barber, what do you ask for?  The Blue Lagoon?  What do you ask for?  The Stegosaurus?  Oh, wow.  Wow, I'm so not going to the prom with you.  Another line that was repeated two million times.  That one was repeated two million times.  The Blue Lagoon, 80s reference.  They just got to throw any 80s reference in there. 
[01:06:00]  I can only watch that show if I was in an oxygen tent.  Maybe.  You know?  Smoking.  It actually sucks the breath out of you to hear some of that stuff.  As that clip played, a tumble, we blew across...  I stink!  It blew across the chloroferm?  Yeah.  Oh, I had a good one, too.  I am awful.  It's official.  Rick's off the hook.  No, but I bailed out. 
[01:06:30]  I bailed out.  That is so goddamn funny when he gets all pissed at himself.  I stink!  I bailed out.  I realized I sounded like an Asian, and I stopped it.  Punch out, Maverick.  You're in a flat spin.  Jim Mollison.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jerry, what's up?  I had the spotlight, and I blew it.  Me too, breasted little nothing.  It was your big shot.  Go ahead, fat bosoms.  Fat bosoms.  Puffy bosoms.  What word did you actually trip on?  A blue. 
[01:07:00]  A blue, a cloth.  A tumbleweed blew a cloth.  You rock, man.  Yeah, it's always good to trip on a word when there are hundreds of thousands of people listening.  Not bad enough if you're trying to get phone sex with a fat chick whose kid is screaming.  Hey, guys.  Don't worry, Jim.  No one will notice, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, no, I know.  They didn't notice chloroform.  I don't think there'll be any signs at your Philly gigs tomorrow night.  Some guy with three teeth made a sign that said chloroform. 
[01:07:30]  Chloroform.  And held it up in the front row.  Nobody laughed at your show either.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ho, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Suck.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Boy, that guy throws in a zinger, doesn't he?  Oh, wow.  Get you looking one way, hit you the other.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  He got us.  I thought people were finding us funny from time to time.  Huh?  I guess not.  Seemed credible.  He segued.  Yes.  See, and no one left. 
[01:08:00]  Like your show.  He's probably really funny at the office.  Yeah.  That's that office type of humor, just like Fred did.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  A creeped eye.  Otto and George went on another radio show.  Ooh.  So what?  Exactly.  What?  What difference does that make?  It doesn't make any difference.  The guy's promoting his movie, American Dummy, very funny.  And also, I mean, Otto, they deserve, you know, he deserves whatever credit he gets anyway. 
[01:08:30]  If you get to go on a nationally syndicated show at any hour of the day,  God bless you.  If you're stupid enough to take that and take whatever brainwashing you've had over the years  and twist that into, we should care if somebody that's been on this show goes on another show,  you're looking at the wrong show.  We don't care.  Good luck.  Otto and George will always be welcome here on this show and wherever else they need to go. 
[01:09:00]  If over the years you've heard that it's bad to go on one show and you won't be welcome back,  that ain't this show.  You got your shows mixed up.  We don't care.  We're happy for Otto.  We're not petty like that.  We don't care.  Jesus, it's fine.  Dude, anything good that Otto gets, no one has a problem with.  He's one of the funniest guys ever.  Why would anyone care if he's going to get national exposure in the mornings for his movie 
[01:09:30]  and for his stand-up?  I'm in that movie, so I want him to sell it wherever he can.  Exactly.  Please, if I can get a hummer out of it, go on any show.  God, people are selling it.  Well, hell, you were the killer.  Oh.  Oh.  He's lying.  Oh, man.  Wait a minute.  Both of you guys were in American Dummy.  You know what?  What an American ass I am.  He had a bigger part than me, and I forgot Lewis was in it.  No, I didn't.  Lewis was the...  You got the hummer.  Lewis, you're the club owner in American Dummy, right?  I got the club owner, yeah.  American Dummy.  And Jim's effing your life on the side. 
[01:10:00]  I'm the emcee.  Nina Hartley is in it.  Otto and George.  And Jim Brewer, of course.  Great.  I meet Corialli.  American Dummy.  Brewer is hysterical.  Tony Metropolis.  Dude, I laughed through every take with him.  They had to shoot me from the back, so I kept blowing the takes.  But he was such...  It was the greatest performance...  Oh, the takes you were blowing?  Yeah.  My damn son quit and joined the Taliban.  Listen, kid.  I said the takes.  That little film you guys made is getting a little cult following now, though. 
[01:10:30]  Side splitters?  One of these nuts that is in the dummy.  Yeah.  Party is in the dummy.  Party is in yourself.  There's nothing better than watching a crowd who isn't prepared for him.  Yeah.  Just repulsed.  And what you see is in the corner, 15 comics howling.  Oh, of course.  When the crowd is just too old or they're just a little too outside.  They think they're going to see a cute puppet show.  Yeah.  When you're at Caroline's and Otto and George is there, and you see some of the people that  have stumbled in off of Broadway in Manhattan, and they think they're just going to see a 
[01:11:00]  cute little puppet act.  Yeah.  Oh, it's going to be funny.  Maybe he'll drink some water and have the puppet talk at the same time.  And it's like, you know, he's using the C word.  It's really.  The F and the racism.  It's hysterical.  I can't remember if you were on that show.  It was him and me, and it was two other comics, and I'm in Corialli.  And there was just kind of, you know, your basic normal audience was there, and some  people that I knew, you know, just kind of vaguely from seeing them in my audiences 
[01:11:30]  before, and I went up and I go, weren't they great?  You know, and before, I'm going, you love them.  Yeah.  You're going to love these guys.  And I'm like, and they're on, you know, and they come on, and I don't care.  Every time I see them, I'm like, I can hear the same joke five hundred times.  I'm gagging up, you know, I'm gagging up my lung.  And then I look at these people, and they look at me like, you know.  And they're literally like, you know, in shock. 
[01:12:00]  Shock.  I, you know, I think Lewis, he's a little raw.  He's raw.  I'm like, really?  I said, I guess I've been in the bunker too long.  I mean, I just, and people just walk out, and some of them, it's like, you can tell them,  you know, when I'm on the road, you go into a club, and he's working like Sundays and Monday  nights, and then people will call up and say, well, you know, what do you mean 5X rated?  And so you.  5X.  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  It's like, you know, you'll listen to these guys trying to do his act on the phone to the  customer.  Well, you know, it's like, then you just, you know, you've got like a 17-year-old trying  to do Otto and George, and then people will show up thinking, oh, you know, how bad can  it be?  Hussah!  Hussah!  When it's Vince Proud, though, when they're there to see him, he, he, it's disgusting to  watch how hard he kills.  Unfollowable.  All right. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, here you go.  Hey, we've got two girls outside the studio.  Ah!  Are they here for the Naughty Nighty contest or to take out the garbage?  What?  Oh, nice.  Dude.  Dude.  You're going to run out of it.  We're being waved off.  Why?  Why?  What the heck?  What?  What happened?  You don't want to see him Monday.  Come on.  What's the problem?  They look really good.  We'll talk to them next.  We'll see what they're about.  Anything's nice to see you.  Also, when we get back in, we've got to give away that trip to see the Patriots versus the  Steelers Sunday. 
[01:13:30]  And I've got to tell people I'm in bananas at Poughkeepsie this weekend.  You just did?  Ah, there you go.  Yep.  We're not going to be around.  And I've got a question to ask you guys in the audience at some point today.  Oh!  Is Lewis doing a tease?  A radio tease?  A radio tease?  I've been with you guys long enough.  Wow.  I'll be in Tulsa by myself someday.  We've got to find Scott Farrell so he can give away the Patriots tickets.  Right. 
[01:14:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Lewis Black in the studio playing bananas this weekend.  In Poughkeepsie.  In Poughkeepsie.  Oh, yes.  From the Daily Show on Comedy Central, of course.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. Bug from New York.  Let me see the feedback there.  Stalker Patty's crib video.  Absolutely effing fantastic.  Congrats to whoever put it together. 
[01:14:30]  Keep up the good work.  Back it.  That's Bug from New York, of course.  Go to opieandanthony.com.  That'll get you the foundrymusic.com link.  Or you can just go to foundrymusic.com if you're lazy.  And check it out.  Stalker Patty's Cribs.  Videotaped.  All put together like cribs.  The best part of the video?  Yeah.  Is Rick's gay pose.  Oh, where he's bent over the...  No, it's not a gay pose.  I was measuring the room using the height of my body.  Oh, there you go.  He used his head and his butt to measure the room. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, my foot.  You know what I have up here?  All we saw was butt.  Were you trying to measure the ceiling, too?  Did you add an extra 14 inches for hair?  Wow, Jim.  I have the clip up of Rick with his bad joke.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, you saw it.  Is it good audio-wise?  I haven't heard it.  All right, let's see.  Tell me when and I'll hit play.  All right, hold on.  We've got to do a little something over here.  A, B, I, I'll hit it.  It's actually input 48.  Input 48. 
[01:15:30]  There's 47 other inputs.  We don't know what they do, but we know input 48 will do what you need today.  So here we go.  With Patty, Steve and I are now expecting a child that quarters here are so cramped.  But we've moved on to the other part of her room.  Steve and Alan.  Ah, forget it.  Move on.  Look how uncomfortable he is.  Yes. 
[01:16:00]  He just told him.  Horrid joke going bad.  It's really uncomfortable to watch the video of that.  That's also on FoundryMusic.com.  Did you see the whole video clip where Rick just like, ah, we got it.  Did you see the sweat just explode on my brow?  Oh, yeah.  But I understand now because he looks uncomfortable in the video as well.  Uh-huh.  Remember on the radio that day when he was filming Stalker Patty Cribs for the website?  Yeah.  He wasn't the regular Rick?  I didn't want to be there.  No.  But now you see the video and you understand there are people peeking behind mongoloid children 
[01:16:30]  peering through windows.  All I see when I look at that video is you with that cell phone in your hand and that flashback  to us being in a paddy wagon.  Oh, yeah.  I do.  I looked at that and I had to stop looking.  Oh, my God.  That was the last thing I remember.  Junkmail Jerry writes, my God, there's more people tripping over lines today on your show  than the retard races at the Special Olympics.  Nice.  All right.  Lewis was telling me he's got a little dilemma. 
[01:17:00]  I got a dilemma.  What is this?  Well, he does that Back in Black segment on the show with Jon Stewart.  Right.  And you needed...  Well, actually, this is the deal.  I'm going to be doing a special for Comedy Central.  And...  Oh, really?  You scored that one.  Wow.  Look at you.  Really?  I wish you guys were with me all the time.  I could have used you around my parents' house.  Whenever I spoke to him, he'd go, oh, yes, very important. 
[01:17:30]  But here's the question.  So the...  Why are you laughing at yourself, man?  Because I'm funny.  You're such a prick.  By the way, there's a girl here for the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Oh, all right.  Let's go to hell with your question.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, really?  Seriously?  She's out there feeling all uncomfortable because no one's talking to her yet. 
[01:18:00]  But we'll get to her in a few minutes.  Go ahead.  I'm sure Jim will be out in a sec.  Yeah, really?  I said hello?  Yeah, you did.  You did already?  She's very nice.  She is.  And she...  So I'm...  I've got...  They said, basically, I couldn't do this thing about Pepsi and Coke, right?  Initially.  Really?  So I kind of threw it out of my...  Well, because, you know, either Pepsi or Coke advertises on Comedy Central.  And, you know, if I did a bit on Pepsi or Coke on Comedy Central, it would bring that company to its knees. 
[01:18:30]  Ah, right.  I would destroy...  You have that power.  Oh, you know, that's the thing.  So then they finally said I could do it.  But then they said the words I could not use...  Ah, that one.  Well, which we had a hard time using on this show.  Which we just 86ed here, I guess, right?  Wait, are we allowed to say that on this show yet?  Ah, I don't think so, no.  Just like...  In the medical term.  E-J.  Yeah.  It is.  It is E.  E-J.  Right, then E-J.  You know.  You know, people...  E-J.  Yeah.  You know.  I got it, yeah. 
[01:19:00]  Egg job.  And then, um...  Oh, hey!  Oh, hey!  That's another one.  That's another one.  Well, there it is.  They better not have dumped out of that, because...  I didn't say...  Come in yours...  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Maybe you're the problem, potty mouth.  You still need a noun, idiot.  You could say, uh, come to my house later.  Sure.  Come over here.  But it's...  Come in the barn for a bit.  But you can't say... 
[01:19:30]  Come in your basement, and we'll have a party, thing like that.  Well, maybe there's a party in your mouth.  Come in your ha-ha-ha.  Well, that's good.  Oh, my...  That's all...  You're such a douche.  You don't even know how to play.  Captain Obvious strikes again.  Joey Big Arms, they dumped everything.  They dumped everything?  They dumped...  Of course they dumped everything.  He doesn't know what they've dumped.  Well, they got Pat Robertson back there on the dump button. 
[01:20:00]  So, he's not...  What about...  Oh, that wasn't religious.  Clink.  So, it's EJ and C in your pants.  Well...  Right, right.  Okay.  All right, Lewis.  And how stupid is that?  Hold on.  What century am I in?  Because I don't know where we are with the dump and stuff.  Well, let's let Anthony explain.  That's okay.  You're not allowed to say the word for a male completion, let's say, that starts with EJ. 
[01:20:30]  Right.  Right.  Good.  And you can't use the word that sounds the same, but is spelt different than come over  here.  Right.  Or come here.  You know how that's spelt.  C-O-M-E.  Right.  There's another version of that used in a different context.  Yeah, but I'm not...  I don't...  I'm not kind of a blackboard and writing it up there.  Exactly.  You just got to say it.  But you can't say those things?  Those I can't say.  But I can say...  It's special.  But I can say...  And can you say this on the air?  Oh, well...  Oh, boy. 
[01:21:00]  Let's see.  Okay.  Okay.  Slowly.  Don't say the whole word now.  So you have the same type of meanings that I have.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  It never...  The fun never ends.  Aren't those meanings really silly?  Well, it's unbelievable.  Start spelling it.  No.  You don't even need to say it.  It's the Pepsi ad where Robert Dole is sitting way too close to the dog.  Bob Dole, right.  And he turns to the dog and says, easy, big fella.  And then my line is...  Oh, yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  You didn't say that?  No, not in that context.  Oh, you were so close.  You are so close.  You can say it on Comedy Central.  That I can say on Comedy Central.  Well, you know, God bless Comedy Central.  Yeah, but what do I do for the first part?  You should have said something like...  So I can get to the second part.  You should have said, you know, how everyone knows Bob Dole holds that pencil.  Just imagine he was holding something else.  Ah, you know, it's...  The Red Rocket.  Right.  Oh, Red Rocket.  The Red Rocket would have worked. 
[01:22:00]  The Red Lipstick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I thought I could say that word.  But really, who knows what words you can say.  Only if you're on South Park on Comedy Central can you say it.  The point you're making, though, is you can say it on Comedy Central.  I can say that one.  But you can't say it on our show.  But I couldn't say that on your show.  But I can say the Robert Dole line on Comedy Central.  What I can't say is the first part.  The EJ and the...  The EJ and the C.  In your pants.  Oh, my God.  They can't...  They didn't cut that.  They can't cut that.  No, no.  At this point... 
[01:22:30]  If they're cutting that, then I'm really...  I'm going to be walking.  Oral Roberts, don't dump it.  At this point, I don't know what the listeners are hearing.  Well, I think they got the point.  All right.  They'll piece it all together.  What a dilemma.  So I'm looking for...  Now, what's the problem?  I'm looking for other words for that.  That are funny.  Other words for...  That they'll understand.  EJ and your pants.  And...  Right, right.  That's it.  That's what I'm stuck with.  All right.  And, you know, to really spend my life lying in bed from, like, one to three in the morning  going, well, it could be... 
[01:23:00]  And it could be...  How about some AIDS shake?  Yeah, they would really love that.  That's good.  They would love that.  No, don't say that.  You can't say that.  Can Cartman say it?  Yeah, he can say it.  I think it would be very funny to hear Louis Blanchard.  Louis Blanchard say, shoot the goo.  You know?  Shoot the goo.  That's not bad.  I don't know.  It's so hard to come up with new...  But, you know, it's coming up... 
[01:23:30]  Unique words for this.  And then I turn to...  You turn to Norton, who's like the psychotic theosaurus.  Oh, forget about it.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  How about John Walker's father's chin dribble?  I like that.  Spitting.  Let's see.  You piece it together with what we were talking about earlier.  Perfect.  That won't destroy that joke, too.  That's why you're going to listen to the whole Opie and Anthony show, so you can piece  things together from the beginning of the show, the middle of the show.  They're very good.  By the end of the show, you get the joke.  People wondering why they didn't dump out of Oral Roberts when you said it. 
[01:24:00]  I'm surprised.  With him back there.  Oh, an implication.  So, you need our listeners' help to come up with other words.  I just wondered if they've got some other words.  The EJ word and the blank in your pants.  Yeah.  Splooge.  Splooge.  Ah.  I can't say that.  You can say that.  Why not?  You can say that.  I'm not saying that in context at all.  It's not even a word.  You can say that.  Not even a word.  Splooge is not a word.  You can say that.  You dump out of that.  I'm rubbing clear stuff on your lips. 
[01:24:30]  That's funny.  That was funny.  Joseph of Arimathea working the boy back there.  It really bugs me.  Anthony, Scott Farrell is on the line.  Yes.  We have to give away this trip for two to see the Patriots versus the Steelers Sunday.  Courtesy of WBCA.  We're running late with our show today, so we've got to take another break.  Oh, damn it.  We're not playing more commercials.  It's just how, you know, if we go long in one segment, then, you know, we have to break sooner.  It's just a mess.  And then maybe the delay will build up while the commercials are playing.  Exactly.  Quick break, and we'll get Scott Farrell to give away that trip to see the Patriots and the Steelers. 
[01:25:00]  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  You know, I just like want to throw up.  Feel the bomb.  And E.W.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Man shouter, Lewis Black.  Man shouter, that'll work.  Baby batter.  That works.  The suggestions are coming in like crazy for the EJ word. 
[01:25:30]  More girls showed up for the Naughty Nighting contest, Dan.  Thank God.  Got a couple new contestants that we'll talk to in just a bit here.  Very good.  Don't forget, tomorrow we broadcast live from Philly.  Yes.  And I believe we're taking that field trip in the morning to the Mudder Museum.  We're going to the Mudder Museum.  You know what this is?  No.  Lewis, it's medical oddities. 
[01:26:00]  In Philly, they got this museum, the Mudder Museum.  And it's like you can see the world's largest colon.  They had one in Washington.  That was the Air Force Medical Museum, the Armed Forces Museum.  Pickled punks.  We want to see the pickled punks.  It's going to be fun, huh?  Yes.  We'll all go into that.  You like this, Norton, huh?  I was listening to, not to the change of subject, I was driving and listening to Disturbed,  and I had to restrain myself from killing people with my vehicle.  See, I told you.  Now, I don't like calling people out on things, but when we brought up Disturbed, 
[01:26:30]  me and Ben a while back, you were like, no.  What?  I never bashed them.  I never trashed Disturbed.  No, I didn't.  I was on the Disturbed bandwagon.  Oh, okay.  But I never bashed them.  Who went to the live show?  Who was banging heads?  Yeah, you guys did.  You're right.  I saw the live show.  Drunken band hanging over the crowd.  It was great.  Yeah, these guys just kick ass.  And like you said, when you're driving, forget about it.  It's white people's answer to rap.  Felonies.  Angry white dudes.  Yeah.  Great.  I was listening to the game, and I just wanted to kill somebody in my...  Now, I wasn't even in a bad mood, but you just felt so good. 
[01:27:00]  I almost wanted to unbuckle my seatbelt and do like five miles an hour  over the speed limit when I play this.  Oh, well, you know.  What song were you listening to?  And I, you know, calmed down a little bit.  Fact of reality.  He just told me my friend is working on the Ozzy show.  That really bugs me.  I want to hang out with Ozzy, man.  That'd be a great episode of the Osbournes.  This little weird man came in and just...  Oh, God.  I love Journey to the Center of Eternity.  And just started hobbing Ozzy's mom. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, dude.  I wouldn't even mind a hand on the back of the head if I was thinking of like  Sabra Cadabra, the Ritz.  If I was just coming over here, I was just going to push the back of your head in it, mate.  It's all right.  It's a good job.  No, I'm okay.  He's trying to get a fatter, but he's got a grand technique.  He's really going to come back to haunt Norton when he turns Christian.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Scott, what's up?  You got something for Lewis to help him out?  Yeah, how about this? 
[01:28:00]  He's got a big fat.  Churning love butter.  Churning love butter.  Too involved.  Yeah.  It's got to be something quick.  Give it a shot.  How about just the...  No, that's too much.  Man chowder I like.  Baby batter.  I like it.  Joe?  Joe?  Got the perfect answer.  All right.  Banana juice.  Now it's Lewis's.  Wait a minute, guys.  Very good.  Now it's Lewis's.  Oh!  Hey, let's say hi to Scott Pharrell, the mad man. 
[01:28:30]  Hey, Pharrell.  Pharrell, hey.  Butter work.  What's up, man?  What's happening, boys?  In a couple hours.  All right.  Nothing new happening there.  Right.  I've stopped worrying about Drew Bledsoe, but...  I think there's more of a chance of him floating in other places.  I mean, they're putting so many big names out on these meaningless, stupid, silly lists.  I mean, how'd you like to be on one of those unprotected lists, and you're basically the  only people that get on those lists are guys that are making too much money that don't 
[01:29:00]  get the job done.  These guys that are overpaid, and there's a million of them that just get tons of money  to do jacking, and they stand around acting all cool, coming out doing calisthenics.  But there's guys that are overpaid.  They put them on these expansion lists.  And the funny thing is, when Cleveland did it and drafted, they didn't take any of the  high-priced guys.  So if you're on one of those lists, you're going to be done, basically, and you're going  to get waxed.  So, I don't know.  Bledsoe, I think, got screwed in New England.  I mean, I think people are going to be quick judges of this guy, Brady. 
[01:29:30]  Everybody thinks he's the savior in some awesome way.  I mean, what is this guy, Fran Tarkington, all of a sudden?  I mean, this guy has one season where he hands the ball off to Smith, and their defense got  the job done.  I think it's Belichick's defense.  I think Brady's done a decent job, gotten the job done.  He's a winner.  Scott, he threw for 300 yards in a blizzard.  That was all wonderful and fine.  I thought he was a pussy when he played in Michigan, and I think he's overrated right now.  Scott, hold on, hold on.  He should never win the Rose Bowl or anything else. 
[01:30:00]  I mean, I think the guy's, you know, you're not dealing with Terry Bradshaw here.  All right, at this point, I've got to explain why you're back on our show this afternoon.  I've got no problem.  We're trying to make nice with Boston, because you really pissed them off the other day.  They're going to get whacked this week, so who cares about any of the peasants?  What, are they going to blame me?  All of a sudden?  I mean, I've never seen a team get so little press or coverage going into a championship  game in my entire life.  Can you imagine?  I mean, look at some of the teams that have been there for the Patriots in the Super Bowl. 
[01:30:30]  Do you think Parcells' teams would have been dicked like this?  It's incredible that they don't even get mentioned.  In fact, they go to Pittsburgh just to talk to the worst players on the Steelers' team  that say stuff like,  Yeah, we haven't even looked at one game, Phil.  But we looked at some places down on Bourbon Street where we can get a quick fix.  We're going to be hanging out down there at the Stats and go over to eat some of that  jambalaya, bitch.  Who cares about them?  Do they play in the AFC?  I thought they were moving down there in Texas with that new glass building down there. 
[01:31:00]  Straight up.  You coming with my posse?  Yo, Michael's struggling on the streets the other day in the mad head.  Hey, annoying laugh.  Anthony's in the studio.  He needs to ask Scott something.  I told him later.  Scott.  What up, dude?  Was it a great move by Ron Lowe to change the lines two games ago?  I was just thinking, you know, I mean, obviously, they're going off that line.  I think Ned Vett's play with Flurry last night was great.  But Flurry's such a naughty boy. 
[01:31:30]  I get bored with the fines.  You give a hoo-ya-to-ya to a bunch of fans that know you're ripping the slipper and you  give somebody the hoo-ya-to-ya and you get fined a thousand.  What's that going to do to some guy?  If they would have done that to me every time I did something naughty in my radio career,  I'd be broke.  I mean, I want to be, you know, getting fined for doing something, you know, dangerous.  I mean, but they're scoring goals.  They're getting excited.  Too bad they didn't win a game for a month.  I mean, you know, get back to reality. 
[01:32:00]  That team, every night it's the same guys that produce.  It's either Flurry or Lindros when his head isn't bobbing around like one of them bobblehead  balls.  He's got a loose noggin.  You know, everybody's home, but there's only three lights on, four rooms upstairs.  I mean, I don't think anybody's afraid of them.  The longer they play, the more dangerous their chances are of making it.  Oh, right.  I think they're fast, though.  Obviously, I keep the checks together.  They all speak check on the team buses, too.  I used to think they were talking bad about me.  Lewis, this is our new morning guy here in New York. 
[01:32:30]  You should have seen it on these team planes and on the team buses when I did the NHL.  I mean, there's like 16 languages going on the bus or the plane.  I thought I was tripping.  I never knew who to believe.  And they'd look at you funny.  Like, the checks are all cherry pickers anyway.  I think they're all shoplifters.  Checkles the box.  Shoplifters.  Hey, Scott, is it true where you go drinking at the Hard Rock every morning at 10 after your radio show?  I try to.  10 in the morning. 
[01:33:00]  He's slamming it out.  And tomorrow I'm feeding the general public the citizenry of the middle of it all here in the Manhattan.  We're going to feed them.  We're just going to feed them some sloppy eggs and some home fries and bacon, a slab or two, like crisp salt.  Maybe a little corn corn blue.  And then we're going to stuff them with horseradish-ass Bloody Marys that just make you leave a bit.  That's great.  I went today to meet. 
[01:33:30]  I had her drop like a little lumber because I got one of the souvenir Mickey's, like, mugs or whatever.  And little did they know, I threw a bash in there one night.  There was 2,000 people.  These were filled up with stupid chicks doing weird.  And I said, yes, I'd love a little glass.  Give her the money to pay the bill.  And then she reaches down with a glass.  And then she gave me a little bit of a, just a little nudge, a little bit of a little angle.  I think she may have rubbed me.  All right, Pharrell.  Man, I hope they have a nice trip. 
[01:34:00]  Are these people winning it from Boston?  They're going to go all the way there.  And I just love you.  We had such a great time.  And then they get back to the hotel room and everything's gone.  The Steelers are going to do them back.  They're going to be like this.  You ain't going to wake up.  You like cucumbers?  Really?  It's going to be ugly.  They're going to blitz on every down.  And that Brady guy is going to look like Peter Brady.  And he was ignored on that show, too, running down the end of the drive. 
[01:34:30]  They're going to get hit by a car.  Peter would show up.  I'd go.  You can go up on Mount Washington and ride the trolley car.  Tomorrow morning, and give them a piece of your mind, Boston.  They can't dance with me.  You have to be in New York to hang with my show, like, bandwagon.  Can you imagine how many bandwagon Patriots fans are on?  Last week at the game, some old man dropped.  Honest to God, that dude and all of those fans up there, you know, I swear, they're going to learn a lot.  If you're wrong, I may never show up to do my show again. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, really, man.  The bad line is that they're like the bandwagon.  I'm bored with them.  The only place that I can go hardcore is New York.  And there's nothing like it.  I'm bored talking to fans.  And Tom's like, hey, do you think Larry Bird will ever take you again?  They've been the Yankees for 50 years and everything.  I mean, you've got curses.  Look at your wives.  They're cursing.  Well, Boston, we tried.  I got a question.  All right, I got the answer then.  Here it is.  Here's the trivia question.  Trivia question for the trip. 
[01:35:30]  The last time you went to Bourbon Street and got kind of packed toward and screamed toward by your good friend, Brett Favre,  in the Super Bowl, January 26, 97, Pharrell was there.  Do you remember the final score when your little friend drew Bledsoe?  Good and Dance with Brett Favre and the big boys, when the Packers rock and rolled and got it done in your latest debriefing of pain up in the New England area. 
[01:36:00]  Tell me the last time you took it that hard.  Tell me who the head coaches were.  And tell me who the tight end was for the Packers.  Wow.  And tell me, on top of that, what was the crime that he's going to do a little time for?  The crime?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he's the guy.  Jeez, this is a tough question.  Well, we don't want to just let anybody go into Pittsburgh and get their bedroom ride in their car. 
[01:36:30]  All right, let's get the question.  Making out a pierogi maker in the back of a truck in the parking lot.  All right, bro.  Let's get the question straight now.  Is it a four-parter or a five-parter?  Hey, it's like about a quasi-23 phaser.  You got to tell me who was in the Super Bowl, who the coaches were, what the final score was.  The coaches, final score.  Who the tight end was.  Who the tight end for the Packers was.  What was the crime?  And what was the crime?  Yeah, that he would end up doing a little bit of time. 
[01:37:00]  Doing a little bit of time for us.  Shut up, you ass.  It says nothing.  Shut up.  It's not about you.  Don't even say it's easy.  It's not about you.  This guy, Pharrell, this guy, Anthony, is the most annoying son of a bitch you will ever, ever meet.  Give him some, like, backhand upside down, like this.  No, we already threw darts at his back.  I just, you know, with Blaine in the morning, when it gets controversial, I just start up on him.  And I'll just go right over and jack him with a couple of noogies on the top of the head. 
[01:37:30]  We threw darts in this guy's back once.  Every time I see you guys over there, there's violence.  One's stuck on a shoulder blade.  Some kind of tipping over.  Not like cows, either, like they do up in Boston.  What do they do?  Run by the river over there?  There's no stuff people in rivers here.  There's no cows near the river in Boston.  They'd be so lucky to have my spot in it.  Wake them up, all those ugly people.  Oh, my God.  All right, Mark.  Mark, you there?  Yeah, what's up, guy?  Yeah, you want to?  Oh, he doesn't sound too happy. 
[01:38:00]  My thing they do well up there is drink.  All right, Mark, score of the game.  I'm not very, uh, I don't know.  I hate this guy and stupid long-ass questions.  Good.  Ah, he's all pissed off.  I hope you guys have a good game.  Patriots 23, Steelers 20, let him.  All right.  Well, let's try Dave.  Dave!  Yo, I have no idea.  Oh, wow.  Listen, every other person's filled up on 10-foot graphic hits.  All right, let's go to Sal.  Someone's going to get this.  Sal. 
[01:38:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right, what's up?  I got this.  You ready for this?  Yeah, do it slow now.  All right, give me the first question.  Pharrell, first question.  All right, the Super Bowl in 97, January 26th.  You obviously know who the teams were.  Oh, yeah.  Tell me who the coaches were, the final score, who the Packers' tight end was, and what he  was accused of.  Okay.  We got 35-21, and the coaches, Bill Parcells, even though we flew back to a different plane. 
[01:39:00]  We got Mike Holmgren.  That's right.  And what was the rest, the tight end?  Yeah.  For Green Bay.  Mark Chimura.  That's right.  Boston College's pride and joy.  And what was the crime?  What was it?  Sex with a minor, rape or something?  Yeah, he did some chick in a hot tub.  That's right.  He was taking him back to the bedroom, allegedly, at a party next door to his house.  His wife, honey, I'm going next door to get some milk.  Oh, by the way, they just graduated. 
[01:39:30]  All the seniors, they're having a 40-k year at the pool in the back.  And I'm going to drink a 16-year-old.  Listen, I'll be right back, okay?  By the way, you got any smoke?  It was the babysitter.  They lost that game, too.  Like, they're going to lose this one like this.  Pharrell, is he correct on all counts?  Yeah, yeah.  He's a winner, and he can stay in my dad's mansion.  Yeah, man.  Let him stay in my dad's house.  I don't even care if he goes through his suits. 
[01:40:00]  Wow, that's something.  They need to find cash.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me get the plug out.  So, Sal's got, yeah, a trip for two to see the Patriots versus the Steelers.  Sunday, courtesy of WBCN.  Way to go, Sal.  All right, man.  Thanks, dude.  Way to go, brother.  I like that guy.  I'm sorry, man.  Can I ask Pharrell a question?  Yeah, go ahead.  Got swaps with that guy.  Hold on.  He can come to New York any time.  Pharrell, hold on.  Sal wants to say something to you.  Go ahead, Sal.  Hey, what place are the Bruins in Pharrell?  The Bruins, I know.  And you know what?  What they do last night, lost to the pathetic team that hasn't won in a month. 
[01:40:30]  All right, yeah.  Thank God for Joe Thornton and Billy Guerin.  I love my boy.  You should have never gotten rid of Miko Pharrell or Ron Lose this one like this.  Pharrell, is he correct on all counts?  Yeah, yeah.  He's a winner, and he can stay in my dad's mansion.  Yeah, man.  Let him stay in my dad's house.  I don't even care if he goes through his suits.  Wow.  That's something.  I need to find cash in there.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me get the plug out.  So Sal's got, yeah, a trip for two to see the Patriots versus the Steelers.  Sunday, courtesy of WBCN. 
[01:41:00]  Way to go, Sal.  All right, man.  Thank you for that.  Way to go, brother.  I like that guy.  I'm sorry, man.  Can I ask Pharrell a question?  Yeah, go ahead.  Got a swat with that guy.  Hey, Pharrell.  Hold on.  He's cool.  You can come to New York anytime.  Pharrell, hold on.  Sal wants to say something to you.  Go ahead, Sal.  Hey, what place are the Bruins in Pharrell?  The Bruins, I know.  And you know what?  What they do last night, lost to the pathetic team that hasn't won in a month.  All right, yeah.  Thank God for Joe Thornton and Billy Guerin.  I love my boy.  You should have never gotten rid of Miko for a little ronka.  But I love Sensanoff and DeFoe beat up the lead head. 
[01:41:30]  I love a goalie that'll go, hey, bigger, hey, bigger, hey, bigger, hey, bigger, well, then put a headbutt.  Jesus, forget it.  He's not worth it.  I love the guy kept there.  They ran him out of New York.  They thought Robbie was loose in the head.  I love Jackie Parker.  He's got a wicked hot slap shot over there.  With the carriers in the Beanpot Classic.  I'm loving him up there.  See, Pharrell knows more about him than they think.  Who takes the ferry to ping him? 
[01:42:00]  All right.  Sal, hold on the line, all right?  Yeah, man, thanks.  Congrats.  Later.  There goes Sal from Boston.  He's got the trip.  I got bonus questions.  That's okay.  That's okay.  We gave away the trip.  Pharrell, you rock, man.  All right, man.  Remember, tell them freaks to come eat free food Friday.  What's tomorrow, Friday?  Yeah.  I lose track of the days.  It's like all the cans in my garbage.  They all look the same, those pretty beer cans.  So what, are you doing the show live? 
[01:42:30]  Well, no, we're going to do the show first, and then I'm going to try to work another angle  on that hot Lisa girl.  All right.  So a hard rock right after the show tomorrow.  I've got to tape a TV show down at the Times Square Zone, and then I'm going to go up there.  I'll be there late, but everybody's going to be up there.  By the time I get there, by the time I get to Arizona, they'll all be passed out on the  floor.  The last time Justin's band went over there, Dripping Jesus Satan Blood, they played heavy  metal.  My guy Double R went over there.  I told you, he got his head kicked in.  He took on 20 dudes.  I figured tomorrow somebody might show up from Boston, and we can break their nose. 
[01:43:00]  Come on down to New York.  How do you like me now?  They will come down.  I hope a snowstorm pales the area with six feet of blanket and hard ice and cars going  to ravines and people who are left to free.  Pharrell, I'm going to do you a huge favor, man.  What's the number that people can call you on tomorrow?  Because they'll call from Boston like crazy.  Which one do you use?  Well, if they got a call from Boston, they'd call that 212-757. 
[01:43:30]  1027?  1027.  The other 877 number we got is just for people from Jersey.  We like to keep them at a distance.  All right.  Boston, if you want to give Scott Pharrell a piece of your mind tomorrow, 212-757.  Well, they finally have some fun for a change in the morning.  They've got to be awful up there.  They're hurting for some fun.  At least we talk sports the way it should be.  Gambling, drinking, thinking, and stinking.  All right, Pharrell. 
[01:44:00]  God bless you.  Peace.  Don't blow up, man.  We like you.  All right, there you go.  That was unbelievable.  Even if you didn't have any idea what he was saying, it was unbelievable.  Yeah, and most of the time you don't.  This guy has a long track record.  He's a mess.  He gets kicked out of every radio station that he's at.  The guy's had 1,000 jobs at 1,000 different stations.  We're the same.  We're telling you this.  Yeah.  And look at us.  He's worse.  He is a complete F-up when it comes to holding a job down.  We know he'll either...  Does he do mainly sports?  Yeah.  Well, and like... 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's great, though.  It's great to live.  Yeah.  Well, it's unbelievable.  This is what's going to happen with Scott Pharrell.  He's either going to just one day decide he doesn't feel like working anymore and just  walk, or he's going to get fired.  No doubt in my mind.  I don't need this crap out of here anymore.  Checks are shoplifters.  There's a...  Checks are shoplifters.  Well, I don't...  And that just came out of nowhere.  You actually heard that it was Checks?  Yes.  Because I couldn't tell you who the hell he was talking about.  Well, they've reached a point where it's just, you know, sounds for the sake of sound.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  What?  Very good. 
[01:45:00]  You guys are ripped, man.  All right.  Why don't we check out the Naughty Nighty Girls next, okay?  Why don't we?  The Opie and Anthony F.U.Line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Very busy today.  Got girls in Naughty Nighty's all over the damn place.  Yeah.  Louis Black in the studio from The Daily Show and Comedy Central. 
[01:45:30]  He was taking a look at Rick as Rick was posing the ladies.  Rick is out there posing the ladies.  Opie comes out and says, let the ladies, maybe they have their own pose.  And Rick is like, no.  No.  Rick has to pose them.  Rick is completely, he literally, you know that movie Star 80?  The guy who's...  Star 80.  Right, right.  He's like, he's got a look in his eye.  He's very serious about it.  He's serious.  And he's like in his own movie.  He did the same thing when we were in prison.  He was telling the guys, come on, just turn over. 
[01:46:00]  Just give me a little more bite.  Oh, God.  I forgot you guys are in the joint together.  I always forget that.  Well, he was doing it there and he would click it.  He didn't even have a camera.  He was just pretending to click something.  Like, there's such a camaraderie between you guys that spent that time in the joint there  a little over a year ago.  Yeah.  If you get this look in your eye like, we all know the secrets that we hold here and they'll  never go past us.  We all know we'll never be back.  We all know that.  We all know.  I sure hope so.  We all know there is, well, of course, depending on what kind of thing you guys come up with. 
[01:46:30]  There it is.  It's a theme from Oz.  You like it there, Lewis?  Lewis in the weight room.  Hi, I'm Lewis Black.  Who are you?  Hey, why are you stabbing me?  With your junk.  Hey, Lewis in the joint.  Well, if you want to stay out of jail, why do you keep coming on this show?  We're the only people that have gotten you incarcerated.  I keep wondering what's next.  Except for that drug charge back in the 70s, wasn't it? 
[01:47:00]  79, I think.  No, my only charge ever was for littering.  Littering?  Yeah.  I threw newspapers at a car window.  Did you get caught?  You did?  Oh, well, we did it.  We were driving in a very small car with a tuba in the back.  A tuba geek.  How many people would there be?  I wasn't playing the tuba.  Oh, watch it.  Just watch it.  You know something?  Even if you're in a car with a tuba, you're a geek.  You should be arrested.  Because you know somebody that has that tuba.  Well, when you're arrested for littering, you're a geek. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, that's true.  You know, really.  We picked up all these Washington Post and just fired everywhere.  We went into a neighborhood after neighborhood.  Bring it up.  You're wild.  Woo!  It was crazy.  Woo-hoo!  It was a crazy time.  It was wild.  We were different, though.  We were different.  Did you do some lawn jobs, Lewis?  Some donuts?  You had a bun run.  We pick up the early morning deliveries of bun and bakery stuff and throw them at windows.  Ah, that was fun back then.  Did you ever throw hot oil?  We used to take like a margarine dish of hot oil and dump it on people's consoles in their  open car windows in July. 
[01:48:00]  Really?  And what would that do?  Yeah.  Just, it was the greatest because they would just get home and their console would be destroyed.  And one time we found a melted chocolate ice cream and there was like a velvet, like  a tan interior, like a little, you know, a seat back.  Right.  A little first seat back.  And we dumped it all over it and we drove by 10 minutes later and we see an 80-year-old  woman wiping chocolate off an 80-year-old man's back.  Oh, God.  So you knew the old cripple had just gotten in the car and gotten a back full of warm ice 
[01:48:30]  cream.  I'm sorry I interjected.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I just heard childhood stuff.  Yeah, we should do stuff like that.  Yeah.  We did the bun runs.  You ever see that?  It's not, I guess, Long Island.  It's pretty exclusive to places like Suburban.  Yeah, Long Island.  We need to be able to have this stuff out front.  What's up, the bun runs?  The bakeries and whatnot, the places that deliver the bread to the supermarkets, the cakes,  everything, would leave them out by the back door.  You hear them in the background?  At about five in the morning.  I know, you hear them? 
[01:49:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tell them about that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's just got to open his effing mouth.  He can't shut up.  Yeah, I can really say that.  He can't shut up.  You see him in the corner?  You're talking and he just keeps talking.  He was trying to get my attention while we're talking here.  What were you pointing at?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I have a girl here.  That's all I was saying to you.  So what?  Rick will tell them.  God, are you thick?  You had to get my attention to tell me there's another girl here?  Him and his fat John Walker head.  Yeah, it's the shaved John Walker head now. 
[01:49:30]  So what's a bun run?  Well, that's a permanent shave.  They would...  So they deliver these things in the back in these big plastic racks, just hundreds of  them.  They would leave them out back because within minutes the people that were open the store  would come by, open it, and bring them in.  But if you got there just in time, you'd load them into the trunk of your car in the back  seat and then drive around throwing them at parked vehicles, at the houses.  What's the matter? 
[01:50:00]  It's not as fun as...  Why?  What's in the face?  Oh, melted butter on the console.  No, no.  Chocolate ice cream.  Melted motor oil.  How do you melt motor oil?  Oh, just motor oil.  Melted motor oil.  You cut...  No, motor oil.  Ice cream.  No, my friends' names were Mike and Stanley.  And once...  Bun run.  And they were psychos.  No, it wasn't a bun run.  Bun runs are fun.  They were psychos.  We were driving...  Well, Mike and me were 13 and Stanley was 25 and we were driving down a  highway.  It's in July.  Yeah, he was a karate expert.  We're driving down the highway and there was this bared hitchhiker with no shirt. 
[01:50:30]  And Mike goes, hey, Stanley, let's drive by and throw some hot oil on him.  He wanted to get motor oil out of the engine and throw it on the guy's chest.  You're out of your pocket.  Dude, he was the greatest.  He's got to be in prison.  Because I remember this one lady.  Nice.  This one chick was walking and we had just eaten Chinese food and Mike had this big  thing of hot mustard and he goes, hey, whore, have some mustard.  And he throws it on her and she waved and splashed all over. 
[01:51:00]  You never took the windshield washer of your car, the little things that squirt on the  windshield and turn it 90 degrees sideways and while you drive past the bus stop, you  hit your window washer and it wets them?  No, I didn't grow up in eight is enough.  No, dude.  I didn't do that.  Dude, we were throwing bricks through windows.  Good, clean fun.  Yeah, no, we would brick windows, man.  Brick through windows.  Look how excited he is.  I know.  Hey, Stanley, let's throw some oil on him.  You know, with two turns.  That was his brother.  No, he was cool, man.  Throw some oil on him. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, Stanley, want to throw some oil on him?  And he meant it.  He wanted to get, like, we threw a burning couch on the highway.  These guys were great.  Out of the back of the pickup, he set a couch on fire and pushed it on a Route 1 hoping  a car would hit it and people would be killed.  We were 13, though.  We were cute, you know.  All right.  Cute.  But I didn't think of a whole windshield wiper fluid thing, you know.  All right.  You would appreciate this.  Look, guys, they're damp.  Dude, I threw a cup of tinkle on a couple one time. 
[01:52:00]  I was drunk and I filled a cup and I put a lid on it so it wouldn't lose any in transit  and there was a nice couple walking and I threw it and the arm went up to block it  and it splashed all over them.  Now, me, I would have yelled, thank you, if someone did that to me.  You know, you might appreciate this.  Wow.  It was a stripped Volkswagen bug.  Oh, boy.  We picked it up, put it in the back of a pickup truck, and while doing 60 miles an hour on  Southern State Parkway very early in the morning, pushed it off the back. 
[01:52:30]  Okay.  And watched it roll over and over down the parkway.  That I like.  That's fun.  That's good, right?  Yes.  All right.  Anytime you're throwing a metal object that people can easily be killed and hit.  And let me tell you, it looked so cool, we backed up, put it back in, and did it again.  I like that.  Because it looked very cool watching it fly out.  That's a far cry.  In a mescaline-induced haze that we were in at the time.  Far cry from a little bun against a parked car.  All right.  I'm sorry to disappoint you. 
[01:53:00]  Hey, pal, butter my roll.  That I like, Ant.  All right.  Let's bring in the girls.  Let's do that.  This show is lacking in the nude woman form today.  This makes up for the John Walker rant from earlier.  It's hot.  Bring them right on in.  We have three or four new contestants for the Naughty Nighty contest, Ant.  Tomorrow, we will not be in New York.  So, ladies in the New York area, sorry, don't stop by the station.  But.  I'm down to Philly.  But if you're close to the Philly station, WISB, come on by between 3 and 7 with your Naughty 
[01:53:30]  Nighties, and we'll take your pictures down there.  Oh, look at this.  Nice.  You'll like that, Naughty.  Oh, a lot.  There you go.  Very nice.  There's another guy.  Girls, pull up to that mic.  Don't let annoying laugh Anthony scare you.  He'll probably just start babbling over you, girls trying to talk.  Young ladies in the studio.  Yes.  What's your name?  I'm Christy.  Hi, Christy.  How old are you?  23.  Pull that mic up a little closer there so we can hear you. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, hold the mic.  There you go.  Just hold it.  A nice, nice naughty.  And brunette, Anthony.  Yes.  Very nice Naughty Nighty.  You want to describe the Naughty Nighty?  It's see-through, obviously.  It's see-through.  I'm just wearing a thong and it's long.  Black, very sheer, very clinging to your form.  And I did a wow in the picture for you guys.  You did?  How about a wow in here?  Okay.  For the guys.  Yeah, sure.  Lewis thinks he's going to jail.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow, there you go.  Hey, Stanley, let's throw some oil on her. 
[01:54:30]  That's 34C?  No, 36C.  Two inches off in the back there.  I'm usually good.  You usually are.  You're losing me.  I was close.  How about a little age guest then, Opie?  Age guest?  Oh, we already did.  You got the taint?  Yeah.  Oh, she told you already.  Is the stinky cam on?  Oh, damn me to hell.  Darn it.  Look at Norton looking out for the listeners' interest.  These girls are hot, man.  People at home on a computer. 
[01:55:00]  Look out for the listeners' interest.  Go to the stinky cam.  Let me pop that up then.  Stinky cam.  And why don't you, what's the other girl's name there?  Krista.  Krista.  Yes.  And how old are you, Krista?  You don't want to guess?  Guess for real?  No, for real.  Or taint?  Taint is a guaranteed winning, he will know, your age.  No, correct.  No taint today.  Oh, no taint.  No taint.  We don't just guess. 
[01:55:30]  Very conservative girls involved in the Naughty Nighty contest.  I don't guess ages, I tell you ages.  Yeah.  We're used to like contests where, you know, we get a lot of hose bags and wouldn't mind  shoving a wiffle ball back.  You know, but the Naughty Naughty Contest, Naughty Nighty Contest, very Nighty Naughty  Contest.  Yeah.  Hey, shut up, man.  Hey, I'm a tumbleweed.  Chloroform.  Did you hear what he said the other day, Lewis?  He goes, oh, I don't know, put some chloroform over her face. 
[01:56:00]  It was such a great rape joke, spoiled by my dumbness.  What an ass I am.  Hey, is it possible to, I don't mean to interrupt, could they show the thongs for the camp for  the listeners?  Ah, you know, if you would pull that up a little, put the camera down, though, because  I can't, uh.  A little lower.  Oh, that's good.  Now we see the console.  Hold on.  Come on, Drew Boogie.  Drew Boogie, you're no director.  You work magic with the, uh, with the wax discs.  Hold on.  All right, hold on, hold on. 
[01:56:30]  And now he's directing.  Now Norton is directing.  Get it a little closer to the edge of the console.  Yeah, and then point it down a little bit more.  There you go.  And I will now.  Are we going to get both girls at the same time?  Yeah, both of them at once.  Yeah, both girls.  Get in there.  There you go.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now stay right there.  I am snapping a little shot there.  You've got to go lower, though.  Yeah, it's got to be one, uh, lower.  What are you doing, Drew Boogie?  Put it lower.  Get those dumpers in focus.  A little lower.  A little, still lower. 
[01:57:00]  Lower still.  There you go.  Now over toward the blonde, a little, or light-haired one, a little more.  Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.  Good.  And snap.  There you go.  And snap.  Let me see the picture, Anthony.  It's very nice.  Very nice.  Oh, good job.  You're welcome, people at home who are now whacking their bags looking at that.  And their pictures will be up on opanthony.com.  Uh-huh.  The Naughty Nighty Contest.  We've got a trip for two to Hedonism 3, Anthony.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Who's the other girl? 
[01:57:30]  She's getting her pictures taken.  Interrupt the picture taken.  Just stop.  Yeah, yeah.  Enough.  Tell him to calm down and wipe him off.  Your girls like doing the, uh...  Here, Jim.  Jim, open the door.  All you hear is, oh, my God.  I don't want to interrupt.  Really?  What are you looking at?  Wow.  Yeah, get her in real quick.  Right now, what's the matter, Norton?  He's vicious.  She's got her hands and knees with her hiney up in the air, and Bob's big boy haircut  is running around taking pictures of her.  Here he comes. 
[01:58:00]  Hey, Reagan, bring the girl in.  Look at that lady.  It bugs me.  It's so nice.  Wow.  Anthony, I think this is a first.  We've got, I think, three finalists in the studio.  Yes, at the same time.  Three finalists in the studio.  Bravo.  Nice.  Look at that.  Naughty nighty contest.  Why don't you step right up to that mic over there?  She just wants to get naked.  You can tell.  She was like...  Hey, how you doing?  Getting all itchy with her hands around her...  You wear...  Clothing.  You wear that a lot when you're, uh...  When you're effing? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Right before you F.  All the time.  Yeah.  What's your name?  My name is Simone.  Simone.  And how old are you?  22.  Oh.  There you go.  Very nice.  A little, uh...  Uma Thurman hair.  That's sexy, man.  Oh, you noticed that, right?  Yeah, thanks.  Uma Thurman, uh...  Thanks.  Uma Pulp Fiction hair.  I always, when I wear my...  I have a tall, the vinyl...  Maybe you shouldn't talk so much.  I get Julia Roberts all the time, which is a hooker.  Oh, pretty woman. 
[01:59:00]  Pretty woman, right?  Oh, right.  Yeah, I get Julia Roberts when I wear my...  I don't, I don't see it, but people...  No?  I guess the hooker cut.  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So it's the hooker cut.  I don't know.  When you're Julia Roberts is a hooker.  Yeah.  What a bargain.  He got three grand to bang her for the week, man.  That's really nice.  That's what Richard Gere was paying.  Yeah.  God, what a hack.  Oh, you can't do that?  I don't know.  We'll see.  Oh, I think that'll work.  Rump roast.  Rump roast.  Take it easy, Lord and Savior with the thumb button. 
[01:59:30]  Get a grip on yourself.  There's terrorism going on.  You don't have to do anything.  Jordan's killing today.  I love it.  I can't wait to see you in Philly tomorrow night, man.  Can we see the bottom part of that a little more?  Could you lift up the...  Yeah, the stinky cam.  Or take it off.  I saw you're ready to untie that.  We don't discourage that at all.  The stinky cam for the listeners at home, man.  Hold on.  We got to...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you can just get naked.  I mean...  Yeah, yeah.  Just take off whatever you feel you can do.  It looks like she just wants to be naked.

Her boyfriend...  Dude, I want to smell your mule.  What?  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my...  Oh, my...  It's not even because of her.  He's just tall and handsome.  Oh, my God.  He's strapping, right?  Oh, my God. 
[02:00:30]  Washboard abs, young-looking fella.  That's great.  He's smelling my mule.  Oh, man.  What do you think, Lewis?  He is lost.  This is all for you today, Lewis.  It's perfect.  It's perfect.  It's the moon has come out.  And we have an hour to go.  I think we have a couple more girls.  But who can top Mad Dog today?  They are hot, man.  Three finalists.  Who?  Norton is out of his mind today.  Oh, he's out of his mind.  I was asleep last night.  I'm really tired.  Yeah, three hot girls.  He had to bunk me. 
[02:01:00]  Three finalists in the Naughty Naughty Contest.  I do believe, Anthony.  That's good.  The top on that, very nice cleavage is showing there.  Sir, do you do the TF on her?  I try as much as I could.  Yeah?  He tries at the TF.  Yeah.  A cleavage like that just deserves a...  It works out.  Other than that?  Lay the mule right in the trough there and just let it rip until it burps.  How about all the girls just get naked?  Wow, that'll work.  That was nice.  I just want to go over there and tussle your hair for that one. 
[02:01:30]  Little fella.  Try that one at the Sweet 16 party after Spin the Bottle.  Get naked.  No.  Fine.  I'll leave.  Truth or take shovel in the head.  That's a good game.  Now, very lovely girls.  Fine additions to our contest.  Tom wants to thank Jim Norton.  Tom?  Yo, Norton.  Yes, sir.  You are a god, man.  Dude, you get the cam at home?  Yes, sir, I do.  I'm looking at it right now.  You like that, huh? 
[02:02:00]  Oh, dude, there's nothing better.  The nice ass, there's nothing better.  Oh, guys, awesome.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  Lewis Black, Friday and Saturday night.  Poughkeepsie.  That is comedy for Poughkeepsie.  Oh, very good.  Lewis.  Wow.  Lewis, I will see you on Saturday night.  I already got my tickets, buddy.  Thank you very much.  You are a very, very funny man, without a doubt.  Show Lewis the love.  I will, definitely.  We're bringing, like, three other people.  But, Norton, you are a god.  I love you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  I love you as well.  There was breaks. 
[02:02:30]  I went to use the bathroom before, and this dude and his girlfriend are in there.  Oh.  And I opened the door inadvertently, and I just see him in the sweater and her hiney.  And he's like, dude, come on in.  It's all right.  I'm a fan of the show.  Come on in.  And he's putting lotion on her ass, and I'm just standing.  He was lotioning up the ass.  Lotioning it.  For the pictures.  Put the lotion on the ass.  Uh-oh.  She's going to talk again.  The first time, I worked him out.  Really?  Yes, I did.  It was the first time I ever did it.  And it was funny, because at eight weeks, we were driving on 78, 287, all over the place. 
[02:03:00]  And we couldn't find anything.  Wow.  It was just very, very strange.  Damn.  Finally, we found one.  I worked him out.  And there were, like, what?  Really?  There was a driver.  There was one white guy and, like, seven Mexicans in the back seat of the car.  Hey, even Mexicans love him.  I'm going to present this to my boyfriend.  Yeah.  Nice.  I'm going to win.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Very nice.  You're a fine gift giver.  Why can't your boyfriend want Jim Norton's face used as a chair? 
[02:03:30]  That's a fine gift, sir.  Think of someone else already.  Did you guys get my cyber wow yesterday?  I emailed you.  Oh, really?  Oh, I did.  No.  I told you no.  I'm surprised, because we're concerned.  How about a real wow?  The live one.  There we go.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's slow fade.  Yeah.  That's good.  Huh?  Yours were wonderful.  Oh, yeah.  Wait.  Hold on. 
[02:04:00]  You better show yours again.  She's not feeling the love in the room.  Stinky Cam.  Is Stinky Cam on?  Oh, yes.  Yes, absolutely.  All right.  Don't be.  She's beautiful.  It's great.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  I see the wow wasn't as good, though.  Would all three do it at once?  I mean, I'm not saying that you should.  I'm just saying it's for the people at home.  All three together will give you a really good wow, and then everyone goes home.  Oh, you've got to move over a little.  Hold on.  You see, that's why I said it.  Yeah, all three together.  Beautiful.  Hold the pose for the listeners at home, okay?  Ready? 
[02:04:30]  Hold on now.  Hold on.  Wait for that to count down.  Oh, no.  I'm fine.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Here we go, ladies.  On three.  One, two, three.  Just hold it for a second.  Yep.  Wow.  There it is.  Wow.  That's it.  Yes.  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  Bravo.  There you go.  It's a special time for me, I'll tell you.  Isn't it?  It really is.  That's great.  And don't worry.  It's better than coffee.  If we ooh and ah at one girl's breast, and then ooh and ah at another girl's and stuff,  just think about it. 
[02:05:00]  It's like the retard at the fair.  We'll go ooh at the Ferris wheel, ooh at the cotton candy machine, ooh at the bumper  cars.  It's all the same to us.  We love it equally in our retarded little minds.  Beautiful.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You should be a politician.  Thank you.  Yes.  Yes.  Hey, some of the pictures are up already on opiananthony.com.  Which contestant is that?  Christy?  Yep.  Christy's up, and Krista's up.  No, Krista's not up.  Okay, well, they'll be up soon.

It's a little surprise, Jimmy.  I love surprises.  I love it. 
[02:06:00]  Fish mess.  We're going to be as surprised as those people were when I squirted them with the windsheet  washer.  I'll tell you.  You know, it's funny you did that, because we rode around one time.  This is true.  It was like 3 in the morning, and it was like minus 10, and we had a giant compressed thing  of water, and we were trying to blast people with like, it was like a high thing  of water at minus 10, and we got these guys in New Brunswick, and they  chased us.  They chased the car.  Ten brothers chased the car.  No one wants to freeze.  I'm sure they chased you.  Oh, are you living in the 60s?  No, but we really want...  Did you hook a chain up to the rear axle of the cop car out front of the burger place? 
[02:06:30]  No.  And then speed watching, pull the axle out of...  Fantastic.  Rick's taking more pictures.  And Rick is like, you know, I think there's a whole other...  That's a good shot.  There's a dark side to Rick that I don't want to know about.  Hello.  I'm Rick Guccioni.  She has one of the nicest high names I've ever seen.  You'll like that.  I want to applaud and just cry at once.  There you go.  All right, we got a problem.  What's the matter?  Look what time it is.  Oh, boy. 
[02:07:00]  The ladies let's down again.  Usually the ladies know.  I look at the phones.  I see a waiting on hold girl for the 6 o'clock queef.  Today, nothing.  Nothing.  Have you been here for the 6 o'clock queef?  Yes, I have.  It's great.  Are we blowing off the 6 o'clock queef today?  I don't know.  I don't see anybody that's going to do it.  Oh, boy.  I hope we have one in Philly tomorrow.  A lovely lady from Philly calls us tomorrow for the Philly edition of 6 o'clock queef. 
[02:07:30]  It's funny.  I'm hoping a lovely lady in Philly drinks out of a mule tonight.  I wanted to know if I can play What's in My Pants.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  You know, there's not a problem with that.  Hopefully the answer will be Norton's face.  Oh, God, that's great.  All right, we better...  Yeah, we'll take a break and then come back and see what we can work out.

[02:24:30]  and they really live there  yeah  it's not just a little  roadside attraction  and then at night  the big people come  and they put torches up  and chase them away  what is that  the angry mob  comes  do they make the pants  a little bit wider  to accommodate  those big fat  little dumpers  those little  chubby  rapable dumpers  wow  that hurts  Jim  I'm short  you're gonna rock

[02:25:30]  it's a lot better  whatever  Weston  Weston's a little  snooty bro  there's your moment  in the sun there  Sturbridge  they're rich  and my brother  he's working in Marlboro  I haven't even had  a stop in Sturbridge  since I got Easy Pass  so  it's an achievement  for me  I don't even have to stop  Eric what's going on  how you doing  alright  I was wondering  why you guys  took off the  best bit you guys  ever had  what's that  what was that  the Friday fake  oh when you guys  were in Boston  oh my god 
[02:26:00]  it is such a coincidence  that you bring that up  wasn't that going to be  our 5 o'clock feature  we were just talking  about that  we're trying to bring  more features to our show  I know  we got the 6 o'clock  we want to bring back  the 5 o'clock  what was the 5 o'clock  faker  that was like the best  5 o'clock fake oh  every day  oh  every day  you know  a girl calls  and fakes it for us  it's a great idea  it's basically every girl  I've ever banged  calling in  well  we want the ladies  to take that  and run with it  so if 5 o'clock hits  and we see you on the line 
[02:26:30]  and you want to do it  great  alright  5 o'clock  fake oh  thank you Eric  no problem  there's a midgetville  in New Jersey  as well  Mike you're next  to the Opie and Anthony  show  what's up  yo  hey  the same thing  they talked about  in Edgewater  New Jersey  about a midgetville  is right on  the Hudson River  they used to try  to tell you  that the doors  were all short  and the handles  were all short  for the short people  I happen to know  that's true  what  in Philadelphia  it's the same thing  in Edgewater  everyone said  the same thing
