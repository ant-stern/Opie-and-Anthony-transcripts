<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts and Jim Norton discussing the pre-show atmosphere, specifically the smell of Norton's oatmeal and the lingering aromas of digested food.  This segued into a recap of a previous show's prank involving intern David, adult film star Lisa Sparks, and a listener playing her “jealous husband.”  The prank, orchestrated by the hosts, involved increasingly suggestive interactions between David and Lisa during a staged interview, culminating in the “husband’s” irate arrival.  David, believing the situation to be real, fled in panic, tripping and falling.  The bell was rung 115 times as David's eyes repeatedly lingered on Lisa's breasts and buttocks. The hosts commented on Lisa's physique and performance.  The discussion then shifted to the awkwardness of large breasts in family settings,  Norton promoted his Boston stand-up shows, and the hosts criticized Terrence Howard's singing and various athletes' acting, including Magic Johnson and Pete Rose in commercials.  A caller defended libraries, prompting further discussion. The segment concluded with a search for a clip of bad acting by athletes.

The next segment began with difficulties getting Michael Jordan to deliver a Gatorade commercial line correctly. This led to a comparison of Jordan and Magic Johnson's basketball skills, quickly degenerating into crude jokes about the Lakers.  Audio clips of Shaquille O'Neal's comedic acting were played, sparking  crude jokes about *The Breakfast Club*.  The hosts then discussed the arrests of Ryan and Tatum O'Neal for drug possession, adding graphic details and disparaging remarks about their family. Opie shared a story about an awkward sexual advance from a former friend who later died of AIDS, including homophobic remarks.  The majority of the segment featured a phone interview with Ethel, an elderly woman protesting the removal of a crab apple tree from her apartment complex.  The hosts bantered humorously with Ethel about her age, protest, and wartime experiences in England, before she expressed reluctance to appear on television again. The segment concluded with Opie describing an allergic reaction and briefly mentioning a previous bit involving the Elephant Man.


The following segment started with Opie detailing his severe allergic reaction, prompting discussion and medical advice from callers and on-air professionals. This transitioned into a discussion of Sarah Palin's hacked emails and a bizarre news story about a fish lodged in an Indian boy's urethra. The focus shifted to Anthony’s convoluted tale of a "hostage exchange."  He described a situation where items were stolen from his home, leading to negotiations for their return involving Kenny and Keith. Items included a camera (destroyed in a pool), dry cleaning, and burnt bras from a fire pit. One participant in this incident was present in the studio. The cryptic story, filled with humorous asides and interruptions, culminated in a public announcement of the "hostage exchange" at FH Riley's in Huntingtonville.

The final segment detailed Anthony's repeated burglaries, his gun ownership, and his humorous exaggeration of the financial losses incurred.  He mentioned an upcoming "exchange" involving dry cleaning and camera equipment. The hosts discussed a future show detailing the "exchange."  The segment ended with a recap of the prank involving intern David, a female guest posing as a listener, and a staged confrontation with an actor playing her angry, black husband.  This prank resulted in the "husband" being restrained by security, with audio promised for the next day. The show concluded abruptly with apologies for the chaotic broadcast and thanks to their affiliate stations.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's more than just your life you're hurting.  Think about your family.  Think about your friends.  Think beyond the moment.  Yes.  Yeah, think.  Think before you do one of those dumb things.  Good morning.  Boy, people only heard the stuff that is said the second before the mics go on.  Wow.  I didn't hear the word twink.  That's good. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  Didn't we just do this?  I know.  What happened?  We just did this, didn't we?  This old gag.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, The Opie and Anthony Show, 877-212-ON-A, onaradio.com.  All right, see you later.  Is someone draining syrup from a maple tree in here?  Let me see.  Oh, it's Jimmy's Oatmeal.  It always brightens up the place. 
[00:01:00]  Smells like syrup.  Smells like Vermont.  Yeah.  Because that's all they do up there is like...  Just tap trees.  That's all they do is harvest maple syrup.  Yeah.  They just harvest the maple.  Smells so yummy, Jimmy.  Your dumps must smell great.  They really do.  Oh, wait.  No, they don't.  Sure they do.  I line the house with them.  They're log cabin.  Log cabin.  What happens to tasty, delicious smelling stuff once it runs through the body? 
[00:01:30]  It just gets destroyed.  I don't know what the body does.  Why couldn't it break it down pleasantly?  Yeah.  Like, if you eat a Cinnabon, it should smell like a Cinnabon in the bathroom.  But it doesn't.  It's atrocious.  Yeah, because your body takes all the goodness out of everything.  It takes all the goodness out?  Out of just everything.  I don't care.  How do you turn a Cinnabon, a delicious smelling and tasting Cinnabon, how has that turned  into what amounts to a stinky thing?  Because if it smelled like a Cinnabon normally does, you'd never leave the bathroom. 
[00:02:00]  You just keep rotating it through your body.  We should, like, eat the most delicious thing ever and see if somehow, some way, you know  what I mean?  It's delicious when it comes out.  Well, there's a hint of the deliciousness.  That's great.  What would it be?  Three minutes in and we're into duty time.  Well, what food would be the best hope of that?  Marshmallows.  Oh, something like that.  I think a marshmallow fluff sandwich. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  How about great papayas hot dogs?  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That's got to be heinous.  Actually, what you should do is eat you-know-what and then, eh.  We'll see what happens.  Maybe that comes out like Cinnabon.  Yeah.  No, maybe that's the big trick in this world.  Well, yeah.  No, it doesn't, Jimmy says.  Based on my studies with certain girls.  We're trying to get some audio from yesterday's crazy, crazy show that we had over at the other 
[00:03:00]  joint.  Yes.  Wow.  A lot of people are figuring out that we have this new intern, David.  A little Jewish kid.  David.  A little Jewish kid that has, who's more literal than literal Jim, by the way.  Oh, he cannot understand the difference between a joke, sarcasm, puns.  Everything is literal to this guy.  Everything is literal.  Everything. 
[00:03:30]  Doesn't get it.  David.  You will be dead now if it wasn't my David.  Oh, I am.  So, he does kosher sports for us over here.  And over at the other joint, we had Lisa Sparks come in.  Fine porn star.  Adult film star.  Yeah, whatever you want to call them.  I call them adult film stars when they're here.  I call them whores when they're out in the studio.  Just messy, sloppy whores who have no self-control or morals. 
[00:04:00]  She was very nice.  She's a good egg, as we like to say.  I'd rather have a chick like her in there that's going to do anything we ask for the  show than someone that might be a little thinner, let's just say.  Are you saying that she's a big girl?  I didn't say that.  Well, the big girls do try harder.  We all know that.  Well.  She's just got, you know, I could see how she'd be extremely attractive to somebody  that's into like maybe a bigger booty. 
[00:04:30]  Uh-huh.  Bigger booty.  Yeah.  Talking about, you know.  You know.  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.  The first of the morning.  He tracked today.  We get them all out of the way early.  Yeah.  And we do the show.  Um, well, she was in yesterday and we played a, well, we had a clever ruse.  A ruse.  Going on.  We had David talking to Lisa, making believe, uh, Lisa was making believe she was just like 
[00:05:00]  a listener that came by to see the show and did, but you know, but one of our listeners  that likes to have a little fun, that does, that's a, well, a listener that comes in that's  willing to just hang her cans over the top of her dress.  Yeah, you know.  And perhaps not wear any underwear.  Well, it was whipping out Wednesday yesterday.  Sit precariously in the chair.  So she obliged and she was into it as, as, as a listener.  Sure was.  And then, uh, we got David to maybe do some other things with her and, and these things 
[00:05:30]  got, these things got crazier and crazier as the bit moved along.  And then we, uh, we, uh, we got out there that Lisa's married and Dave was like, you're  married.  And Lisa's like, yeah, but I don't care about him.  And he's in Kentucky.  It's no big deal.  I do what I want.  I do what I will.  And Dave was like, all right, I'm game.  So he's doing more and more stuff and they're really getting into it.  And then, uh, we set up behind the scenes, uh, someone to barge through the door as a very, 
[00:06:00]  very angry black husband.  Yes.  He was black when he got there though.  We didn't change that.  Yeah.  And don't, let's don't tell, tell him what they were doing.  He was doing stuff.  Like he wasn't just looking in their cans.  Like, Oh no, I said, they face against them.  Sure.  You just can't describe it over here, but they, uh, watch the fun as Fanny Flagg and  Nipsey Russell pull off this gag and what we like to call candid. 
[00:06:30]  So, oh no, I think people understand.  Like it went from showing, you know, a little something on Whip Him Out Wednesday and it  got more and more involved and David was really, really into it and having a good time.  I told her to open her legs a lot and talk to him with no panties and don't acknowledge  you doing it.  Yep.  And you'd see him every time he would talk and then you would just see him looking down.  He'd stare down.  And Ant would ring the bell.  Like every time we caught him looking between her legs.  Oh, he'd give a ring.  Well, I forgot.  He just kept ringing and ringing.  I did forget that the bit started with, uh, every time we saw David looking at her, 
[00:07:00]  either her top or her bottom, uh, Anthony would ring the bell.  And I swear we weren't exaggerating yesterday, by the way.  People thought that was really, really funny.  He was just staring down for, for minutes at a time.  So, yeah.  So as he's interviewing this, uh, quote listener, you know, he's taking peaks and Anthony's ringing  the bell.  So the audience knew he was definitely taking peaks.  So, uh, then we decide, yeah, we're going to get the jealous husband involved, but we  had just listeners outside the studio.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Sitting on the bleachers.  So we, we picked one dude that we, we've seen there a few times.  Carlton, I think his name was.  Yes.  Carlton.  And we're like, Carlton, could you play the part of an angry husband?  He goes, yeah, I'll give it a shot.  And we didn't have much confidence, but we cued Carlton at the proper moment.  He comes barging in as the jealous husband.  He has to be held back.  David freaks out.  Right?  Almost, almost craps himself.  He was, he was out of his mind.  Like he was going to die.  And then Anthony, at one point just tells David, you got to run. 
[00:08:00]  I go run.  This guy's going to kill you.  Cause, uh, we had a couple of guys holding him down and he was trying to get up in it.  And then he was breaking the hold of the guys.  And, uh, we were like, just David run, run.  And he ran out of the studio in a way that it, it was a combination girl run, retard run.  The guy is obviously not very good at running.  Yeah.  And then he tripped over his own feet and fell on his face.  He tripped like, like they do in those horror movies when all you have to do is run and 
[00:08:30]  get away from the monster and not run into a tree and not fall down and you're fine.  And, uh, and the listener, he got the crap beat out of him for the most part.  Cause our security guys were playing their part and really roughing them up.  Yeah.  It was insane.  Things were getting broken as this guy was trying to get free.  David's running all over the place.  He doesn't know what to do.  Screaming in horror.  He's trying to figure out if it's a bit and, uh, and, and he, he, he obviously thought  it was real.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  It was unbelievable.  We, we destroyed that kid yesterday.  He's a good egg that David.  And then at one point, cause then we're following him with microphones and he's in a, in, he's  in like an office as, uh, the jealous quote husband is trying to get at him and he's banging  on the door and all you hear is David go, but this, this is, this is my second day as  an intern, it's only my second day, it's only my second day.  He was horrified.  He was so good as a husband.  I thought they actually got married at one point.  He really was good. 
[00:09:30]  He was so good that at the, uh, by the end of the bit, he, he wanted a piece of Lisa cause  you know, he felt like he really was married to her.  Yeah.  So I think we can play, uh, the big reveal clip over here at least.  Yeah.  We'll play that a little later this morning.  Sure.  It was amazing though.  I mean, the guy pulled it off.  Mm-hmm.  Some, some of the, you know, the hardcore listeners saying one of the best bits we've  done certainly in the last couple of years or so.  Yeah.  Uh, Travis counted the bell.  How many times you rang that bell as he was taking a peek? 
[00:10:00]  115 times.  Wow.  He took 115 peaks.  Well, there was a few where ding, ding, ding, ding, cause he kept, uh, looking.  He kept looking.  That was, yeah, that was during the time where he was just staring.  Yeah.  Staring into it.  Mm-hmm.  Into the abyss.  So we felt like we had to tell the people over here what happened.  It was just, it was unbelievable.  That David is gold.  When he came barging through the doors, the husband, oh my God, did it work perfectly.  Perfectly. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  And Lisa Sparks, for a porn star, she had a, uh, she had some acting chops.  Her acting chops.  A little bit.  Not great, but she did okay.  Sure.  You know, embrace the acting chops and maybe put down the pork chops.  Look, I think she's a very sweet girl.  It's just not your type.  Oh, no.  When she was, um, actually straddling.  Yeah.  Uh, young David.  Yeah.  Uh, and David pulled, kind of pulled up her, um, her skirt. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Uh, what was exposed was, um, quite a large collection of skin.  A large collection of stuff.  And booty.  And, um, kind of indentations and whatnot.  Not quite my type.  Uh, all right.  I like them a little thin.  But she had the big boobies.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hanging over the top of her. 
[00:11:30]  Are you a big boobie man?  Uh, no.  Uh, you know, take them or leave them, I say.  I think I used to be a big boobie man.  And then, like, I grew up.  And you grew up and realized, ah, it doesn't really.  And realized how ridiculous it really is.  They have to fit the girl, is what it is.  Right.  If you get a girl with a larger frame, she's got to have big breasts in order to be proportioned.  If she's got small ones, then she looks like a flatso.  We, I don't think we have done that bit justice yet. 
[00:12:00]  A lot of our bits we just develop and we, we redo and redo until we, we, we find perfection.  Mm-hmm.  And there's, there's something there.  We've all been there.  Where, like, a family member or a friend brings their new girlfriend to meet the family.  And she's just a boobie monster.  Yeah.  And then the only thing you can think of is that your friend or family member is obsessed with big boobs.  Yeah.  Because, you know, they're all looking just going, oh, okay.  Usually it's at a picnic or something where the, the big boobie monster, you know, it's a hundred degrees out. 
[00:12:30]  The big monster.  So you got to wear, like, appropriate attire.  But it just makes the boobs look ridiculous.  And, and you don't even see the girl's face or anything else about, you don't even know what she does for a living by the end of the picnic.  Because all you're focusing on is the big boobs.  And then you look at your, your friend or, or family member, like, man, you have a fetish for big boobs.  Yeah.  He's got to have, we never knew he had this fetish, but, I mean, look at them.  I'd like to introduce you to my uncle. 
[00:13:00]  Hey, how you doing?  And then you leave and the uncle goes to the end and goes, oh, Jesus.  He sees some mental problems.  Yeah.  What?  I guess, I guess young Tommy wasn't breastfed as a kid, huh?  And she could be the, the coolest, nicest girl that has the greatest personality, but you just don't see them.  Oh, yeah.  When, uh, they, they bring the, the boobie monster to the family function.  Boobie monster.  That's all anyone's going to look at.  That's all they're going to look at.  Oh, I never, I never knew how this fetish, it's like anything else. 
[00:13:30]  If it's just a, a, a normally proportioned girl or averagely proportioned girl.  Like, you might be an ass man, but.  No one's going to know.  But it's not an over the top J-Lo, holy crap, only see is this ass.  Yeah.  You could be a leg man.  Right.  You could be, you know, whatever, whatever it is.  Right.  But, uh, Jesus.  With, with the boobie monster, everyone's going to look and go, oh, that's what he's into.  All right.  Okay.  And then it's almost.  I bet he likes taking his, and sticking it right between the, and just going until he 
[00:14:00]  all over her.  Yeah, of course.  We're developing that bit.  We need a couple of other scenarios, but we're not letting that one go.  No.  Boobie monster.  All right.  What else is going on?  How are you, Jimmy?  James Norton.  Very good.  Thank you.  Good.  My third Boston show goes on sale this morning at 10 a.m.  No, it doesn't.  Are you crazy?  Are you serious? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Holy mackerel.  You're crazy.  The last one I'm doing is Friday the, uh, 15th at 945 pre-sale this morning.  You're going to do three shows in one day?  No.  One, the late show Friday I'm doing.  Mm-hmm.  It's all the gigs available for, and then two on Saturday.  Wow.  Yeah, it's a good theater, supposedly.  It's a great gig.  How many seats?  1,100.  Holy mother of God.  Look at you.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Uh, Dane Cook.  Please come to this other show.  I don't want to have two sold-out shows and 60 people on Friday. 
[00:15:00]  What happened?  I don't know.  And knowing Jimmy, you know, he won't even acknowledge that he sold out two shows.  Oh, no.  I couldn't get three.  I'm a two-show pony.  I suck.  No.  How do they get the tickets?  Wilbur Theater?  I guess.  My space is a link.  It's a pre-sale again, which have been doing very well for us.  That rules.  Is Boston helping you?  BCN helping you?  Great, man.  Yeah, yeah.  BCN.  They've been great?  Good.  Fantastic.  Good.  You know what it is? 
[00:15:30]  The shows sell out before you use all the advertising.  So you're like, hey, might as well go for another one.  You got the advertising.  Let her rip.  That's Bill Blumenreich's thoughts.  No kidding.  How is old Bill?  You talk to him on the phone?  Hello, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  How's the giant f***ing yours?  Bill.  Stupid magnums.  His magnum condoms.  He carries extra money in them.  That's why it hasn't.  Good old Bill.  His magnums.  The owner of the Wilbur Theater or the promoter or whatever.  He's, you know. 
[00:16:00]  He's the boss.  He's the boss.  He's the boss man up there.  Hey, did you see Terrence Howard?  Anybody seen him sing last night on Letterman?  No.  Bad?  No.  It was weird.  It was kind of bad.  Supposedly, he could sing.  No, I didn't think he could that well.  Oh.  Oh, you thought he was bad.  Maybe you ought to get that.  Yeah.  It wasn't.  You should stick to acting.  Well, without a doubt.  I mean, it wasn't like, oh gosh, the worst I've ever heard.  Yeah.  When I was watching, I was like, yeah.  Very mediocre.  Yeah.  Was it as good as Bruce Willis when he does his character?  What was it called? 
[00:16:30]  Bruno.  Bruno.  What's that?  He sings?  Yeah.  You want to call it that?  He sings a bunch of old, like.  Bluesy tune.  Bluesy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He hasn't done that in a while, though.  No, no, he hasn't.  You're scaring me.  I think he realized that was stupid.  I don't think he's done it in a while.  He's too busy banging like 11.  That's what it is.  I think he did that when he was still married and just to get out of the house or something.  Of course.  Was he good?  No.  No. 
[00:17:00]  He was awful.  Have we had tape of that?  I've never heard it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we could turn you on to some Bruce Willis.  Yeah.  Some Bruno.  He was known as Bruno when he went on stage.  That was Bruce Willis.  That'll get the ticket sold for the third show.  That's like David Johansson when he decided David Johansson wasn't good enough.  So he had to become.  What was his alter ego?  Buster Poindexter.  Buster Poindexter.  What is that?  I don't know.  It was David Johansson.  He did feeling hot, hot, hot.  Yes. 
[00:17:30]  The song that plays in my Coke commercial.  Oh, that's right.  All right.  We got to take our first break.  So we're going to get the David audio of the jealous husband, you know, barging through  into the studio.  David.  To see David just fouling the big boobie monster of a wife of his.  We got the Mets barely hanging on.  Holy gee.  That could have just been another loss so easily.  I will do a little sports after the break.  A-Rod with another useless homer for you, Jimmy. 
[00:18:00]  Wasn't useless.  It gave him a stat.  We got a father and son team in possession of meth.  The O'Neal family.  They're just wonderful.  Oh, the O'Neals love their drugs.  God, all of them.  They're just amazing.  Oh, Ryan.  Oh, yeah.  Ryan.  Oh, just amazing.  The son.  Friggin' Tatum.  The daughter.  They all love the dope.  He's like 67 years old doing meth.  What is going on?  It sounds like I read the story. 
[00:18:30]  It looks like he might be doing the meth, too.  Yeah.  Or he's a big-time enabler.  Something's going on.  I think he's doing it.  Yeah.  We'll find it.  We'll get to the bottom of that.  No, we won't.  Yes, we will.  We get to stuff now.  And then we got athletes acting really bad.  Yeah.  Well, we started this yesterday, and today we got Magic Johnson, Pete Rose, Ron Say.  Remember Ron Say?  Anybody?  The Penguin.  The Penguin.  That's right.  From the L.A. Dodgers.  Rosie Greer.  And a few others that we're going to get to today. 
[00:19:00]  Bubba Smith.  Bubba Smith.  Which one is Bubba Smith?  I don't know.  He was on The Odd Couple.  Oh, well, we're still doing it.  Deacon Jones.  How about Deacon Jones?  He was on The Odd Couple.  Yeah, we'll do a little Deacon Jones and some others.  So stay right there.  Just getting warmed up.  Opie and Anthony.  We had a really good phone call.  He couldn't wait through the break, though, unfortunately.  Aw.  He went with the boobie monster thing? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  He said that he went to some family function.  We nailed it with this guy.  With this girl that had massive boobs.  And the entire family, all they did was stare at this girl's boobs.  Yeah.  Just stare and wonder what kind of sicko is in their family.  That he'd bring that beast over.  And the kid might have normal sex, but the family's thinking, what a perv.  How obsessed with the boob is this kid?  They're just imagining what he's doing with those. 
[00:20:00]  Aw, they're still pushing this piece of crap.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Look at the commercial.  Yeah.  Turk and rooster.  Ow.  Righteous kill.  Yuck.  It's kind of weird to see commercials for a movie that's been out a week around.  Oh, I know.  Usually they push real hard in the first week and then they kind of back off.  You might see a commercial here and there, but we're seeing a lot for this movie.  I know.  God, they... 
[00:20:30]  But what did they pay those to?  How long did they make $20 million each, you think?  Yeah.  I thought you were going to say like, you know, $20.  I would say way more than that in the end.  To have De Niro and Pacino...  Perhaps more than that.  In this, you know, like major roles and for the first time together like that.  They probably have back-end money too.  That's why they push it.  Yeah.  The money in the back.  Oh, yeah.  They're going to get the downloads and the DVDs and all that stuff.  Not in this one, they're not. 
[00:21:00]  Watch.  This thing still makes money.  Oh, you better not.  Hey, so A-Rod becomes first player with 35 home runs and 100 RBIs in 12 straight seasons.  That's wonderful.  It's cool.  And no post-seasons.  Yeah.  And no post-seasons, right?  You got the Rays beating the Red Sox.  Sorry, Boston.  10-3.  Now lead Sox by two games in the AL East.  Wow, the Mets with a decisive win over the Nationals.  That's right, Anthony.  They used eight pitchers. 
[00:21:30]  Eight pitchers.  To beat the AA team, the Washington Nationals.  As they almost blow a seven-run lead, I think.  That's right, Anthony.  But they did get the job done in the end.  That was nothing but a roll of the dice.  It could have gone either way.  They squeaked it out against, wow, that team, the Nationals.  Oof.  Well, the minor league team.  They're kicking ass this year.  That they're allowing to be in the major leagues this season.  I was sure they were going to lose, and it was just going to be like, oh, my God, here it comes. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, well, eight pitchers, so there's a lot of panic going on.  Phillies beat the Braves, so they're still a half a game ahead of the Mets.  And the Yankees.  Yeah.  That's all.  Yeah.  Eight games out.  They won last night, but whatever.  Stunt Brain and I are going tonight to our corner.  Oh, you're going on your date with Stunty.  Yeah.  That'll be fun.  I want to see the game.  Go see.  Yeah.  Yeah, or not.  Are you excited to hang out with Stunt Brain? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  Is Stunt Brain a beer and hot dog guy at the ballpark?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's going to be great sitting next to us.  This guy is as square as they come.  Square.  Are you going to be doing the New York Times crossword puzzle in between innings?  Got your Yankee hat?  White Sox fan.  He's a White Sox fan.  Oh, he's a White Sox fan.  That's right.  I'll be keeping score.  Oh, will you be?  The scorebook.  The scorebook.  And he's one of those guys.  Oh, no.  You're one of those guys.  I hope your beer spills in it.  When do you look at it? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  I always wonder what happens to those scorecards.  What do you do with them after you keep score?  I just hang on to them.  And I put my ticket inside.  You know, you keep your ticket.  Does ESPN call you and go, we need the stats for the game?  We lost them all.  Could you explain what the point is?  Yeah.  You feel like you're more involved in the game.  You kind of analyze.  And sometimes you think, well, gee, what would I do if I were the manager?  I never think that.  I think if I was a player getting laid.  Yeah.  Nobody wants to be Joe Girardi.  What do I do if I'm the manager?  Hang myself. 
[00:23:30]  The team sucks.  The great Logan on Pal Talk.  How old is Stunt Brain?  10?  That's like something you let your kid do.  And, you know, you're all proud.  Hey, look at him.  Come on, son.  Here's the book.  Let me show you how it works.  Yeah.  That makes you feel more connected to the game in 1940.  Right.  How about now where you just go online and look up every stat?  Sure.  Who got that double in 1978?  Let's check.  Exactly.  You don't have to write anything down.  You can just use your iPhone and just get all the stats right there. 
[00:24:00]  Real life scorekeeping right on the iPhone.  Stunt, he's a classic kind of guy.  He's a square.  He means well.  He's old school when it comes to certain things.  I bet you're into literature and stuff.  I bet he reads.  Are you a reader?  Do you read off of paper and not a screen?  Yes.  Ugh.  I don't remember the last time I read off of paper.  You're listening here.  Paper.  I had my library card on the key chain.  He's got a library card.  Yuck. 
[00:24:30]  Only...  Only...  A library card?  Only...  Do they have libraries?  Only pedophiles have library cards.  What?  He likes to...  Yeah.  I hope he's right.  My God.  He likes to put on his silk running shorts and look at pornography on the library computer.  He likes to reach way up on the shelf as he's wearing tiny little running shorts with no  underpants.  Only creeps go to libraries.  No, no, no.  Yes.  Yes.  The library is a great place. 
[00:25:00]  For what?  For what?  You can get hundreds of periodicals.  You can actually get movies and CDs if you want.  Oh, that's right.  Stump Brains and Chiseler.  Yeah.  You can do it online.  I'm penurious.  Everything can be done online.  What's that mean?  I'm cheap.  Are you?  Are you really?  Yeah, yeah.  Pretty much.  It's a terrible quality.  Why?  All right.  I'm not cheap emotionally.  I'm just, I mean, my money.  Yeah.  I spend it, but I spend it wisely.  Let's think.  Libraries are for pedophiles, skin flints, homeless people.  Nerds.  Nerds.  Don't leave out the nerds. 
[00:25:30]  And a little geek thing happening in there as well.  Yeah.  But geeks are more online now anyway, so.  Wow.  I couldn't even tell you the last time I went to a library.  My mother worked at one my whole life.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So I always got the dibs on the new library book.  Did you get that at home a lot?  I think when we were living in Boston, checked out Harvard's campus.  Yeah.  And went into the library there just to check it out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the last library.  All right.  I got you beat. 
[00:26:00]  Last library I went to was, I think I was 18.  Really?  Yeah.  Why are libraries still open?  Don't even need them.  With all the technology today, why would you need to have a library open?  And is it computerized?  Is it nostalgia?  Are libraries computerized now or do you still go to the card catalog where the Dewey  decimal system is still in play?  They're pretty much computerized.  Really?  And some of them keep the old school cards around.  But you can actually, in the New York library system, look up the book online. 
[00:26:30]  Wow.  That's such a treat.  And reserve it and then go pick it up.  It helps.  What is the 800 section?  I don't know.  Pure science.  Excellent.  Excellent.  What was the last book you read?  I'm in the middle of a couple right now.  I told you about them, the John Ronson book.  But I was reading this book, The Sex Lives of the Popes.  It's actually pretty funny.  It's a historical background on the popes and the wild stuff they used to do. 
[00:27:00]  It's pretty interesting.  Popes used to have sex?  Popes used to be married.  Catholics used to allow the priests to marry.  Oh, right, right.  Back in the day.  John Ronson.  Yeah.  Who's John Ronson?  I don't know.  I know Ron Johnson.  He's a stereo salesman.  Yeah.  Likes to go down to the point and have sex with girls.  Yeah.  I guess we should let people know we really do like Stump Ray.  Of course we do.  Oh, yeah.  We just don't understand him.  We just goof on him a little bit.  Yeah.  Because he's kind of nerdy.  We do like the guy.  He knows a lot.  Jimmy, here's Terrence Howard on Letterman. 
[00:27:30]  Love Makes You Beautiful.  Is this worth playing?  What?  Just a little taste?  Let people judge it.  I thought it was kind of, you know.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Terrence Howard.  Terrence Howard.  Oh, Terrence Howard.  Hello, darkness, my old friend.  What?  He sounds like he really wants to sound like John Mayer, but he can't. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, he's got a little Cat Stevens in him.  If I can't align, the moon was high and still.  Breathy guy voices are gay.  That's the first review in.  And flutes suck.  Steve from Bayshore.  He should be singing into the barrel of a shotgun with his toe on the trigger. 
[00:28:30]  Sounds like Ant at the Renaissance Fair.  Hey.  It's a thin voice.  Love should be real.  Right.  Trite emotions.  Yeah.  Love should be real.  Come on, Terrence.  Where's the hook?  Every song needs a hook.  It happens.  When?  Love makes you beautiful. 
[00:29:00]  Love what you know.  All that.  Boom.  Ugh.  Love makes you beautiful.  What's with the la la la la?  Love makes you beautiful.  It's like scary horror movie, kids.  I think he's nervous, too, by the way.  So I gave him a little bit until he's nervous singing.  Wow.  Audio flatulence.  Very good.  A viral.  Who's singing this? 
[00:29:30]  Joaquin Phoenix.  Linger Lunger.  Now on, everyone who's refused to come on this show is going to be punished.  Yeah.  Punishment time.  Dole it out.  Love makes it grow, huh?  It sounds like it would be a good song.  This is my review.  It sounds like it would be a good song if someone else was singing it.  Yeah.  And that la la la la stuff has got to go. 
[00:30:00]  It sounds like the omen.  It sounds like a well-written, well-written song that someone else probably should be singing.  Yeah.  And his voice is not, like, terrible where you go, the guy, you understand why people say,  hey, wow, you can sing.  Yeah.  Because he's probably, like, at parties, he'd sing, like, loud.  Colin, I wish I had Colin's bit, I couldn't do it justice, but he talks with the guy in  the car with you who thinks he has a better voice, and he sings, but he acts like he's  not trying to sing really good, so you compliment him.  But that's pretty much what this probably was, where he would sing, and people would go, 
[00:30:30]  wow, you're pretty good.  Yeah, wow, you ought to jump on that.  Sure.  Because he doesn't have good enough friends around him to go, what are you doing?  Yeah, stop it.  Like, you know, Pacino don't.  People told him that that was a good movie.  Yeah.  Good job, Al.  I would have fucked.  What are you, Melissa?  Yeah?  Hi.  Why are you laughing?  Oh, because I, um, what?  Okay, because you're high.  No, no, no, I'm on my way to work, and I almost, uh, I almost just, uh, ran over some 
[00:31:00]  guy who's crossing the road.  Oh, okay.  What do you have for the show today?  Um, I call because I, I'm calling in defense of libraries everywhere.  Oh.  Why?  Defender of the library, Melissa.  You can get all kinds of free music, and you can get, uh, you can get free books, and  reading on paper is definitely the way to go.  I don't disagree about reading on paper.  Oh, I hate reading on paper.  Yeah, but that's why there's a Barnes and Noble. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Like, if you, if you want to go get a book, you go and get a book.  Yeah, but if you, see, if you, and you read them and you don't.  Huh?  And, you know, because if you read enough, then how many books, you can't go to Barnes  and Noble all the time, because once you're, like, a big reader.  Well, you can, but.  Because, and a lot of books are crap, so, like, I don't want to pay for a crappy book.  And also, when you're done with them, I kind of agree with that, like, I, uh, you read  a book once, normally.  If it's something you want to save, because you love it, you love it, that's one thing.  But most times, I'll read a book once, and, and the only book I've read, like, multiple 
[00:32:00]  times is American Psycho, um, and The Godfather.  Yeah, but you don't, uh, you read a book once, you're done with it.  Are we talking about libraries on this shock jock show of ours?  What are we doing?  Melissa, thank you.  But we're done with the library talk.  I think it sucks.  Stump Brain loves it.  Jimmy's like, eh.  Seems like something that can be erased.  He gets it.  It can be phased out after a while.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe they're still, you know.  Shh, shh, shh, the librarian.  Hey, yeah.  Was your mom a librarian?  She was, yeah. 
[00:32:30]  Aw, sweet.  I love when people are arrested for sex crimes in libraries.  Aw, fantastic.  It makes me laugh.  Does it happen a lot?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  I used to get some of my spanking material from libraries.  Yeah.  I would go in the library, and then I would go to the photography section, and I would get  books.  I would look for books that had nudes photographed, and I would sit there and look through it and  slowly tear pages out of the book that I found of girls that I thought were hot, and I'd fold 
[00:33:00]  the paper up, put it in my pocket, put the book back, find a couple more, and then I run home with  just a friggin' ba-boom.  And once I got home, I would utilize the pages that I tore out of the book.  That's very smart.  It's all I had.  He's lying.  He would tear pages out of Mein Kampf.  Okay.  Might have been one or two.  That's why you can't find any copies anymore.  It's been all over the place.  All right.  We're going to get back into bad acting by athletes. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  This started with the whole Michael Phelps on SNL thing.  It was horrible.  He was really bad, man.  Maybe he should have done all his scenes in a pool or something because it looks like  that's the only thing the guy could do.  But it's a good thing.  I mean, the guy's amazing, right?  In gold medals and all that.  Snaggly teeth.  You can't take that away from the kid.  Isn't it funny, though?  He's the best Olympic athlete in the history of our country.  His acting sucks.  His acting stinks.  Yeah, but what are we supposed to do?  He's got gold medals around his neck.  What are we supposed to do? 
[00:34:00]  We expect high standards from our entertainment.  Acting.  If SNL's going to have Michael Phelps on their show, well, he better do a good job.  Right?  Acting lessons.  Why?  Because is the big get the fact that you get to see him on SNL?  You know what I mean?  I watch SNL because I want to laugh.  He's not making me laugh.  Sorry.  Well, that's why I haven't watched a lot in recent years.  They actually talked about Amy Poehler leaving SNL.  She's leaving after the election. 
[00:34:30]  Well, she's like seven months pregnant or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, she was hiding all that.  She was hiding all that.  Anyway, she's leaving after the election permanently from SNL.  Yeah.  And the news person I heard doing the report on the radio said, the last funny person left  on SNL.  Wow, they said that.  Like he editorialized.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Said the last funny person left on SNL is leaving.  She is hilarious.  Is, what's his name still on there? 
[00:35:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  Who?  Bill Ferdinand?  No.  What's his name?  What's his name?  Hammond still on.  Hammond.  Yeah.  Because I kept thinking Hartman.  But of course, we know he's not there.  Daryl Hammond's still on.  I believe so.  Yeah.  Is he the longest running?  He's got to be.  I think so.  Yeah.  He's got to be.  Been there forever.  She's, um...  Amy Poehler is also...  I watched her improv, and I usually hate improv, and god damn it, she's funny, man.  She's just funny, man.  Ugh.  She's really good at it.  At the UCB, which I think she started. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Um, she's just great.  Speaking of SNL, uh, I guess Sarah Palin thought Tina Fey's impression was hilarious.  Hilarious.  So the Sarah Palin, uh, showing people that she has a sense of humor.  Oh, is that what she was doing?  And didn't mind.  And she was told to say that?  Oh, you think so?  I think she's saying anything on her own accord at this point.  Or do you think, uh, uh, Republican, uh, uh, cronies are telling her what to say?  Of course they're, they're coaching her, telling her what to say.  You know, I think it'll be nice if you say that you enjoyed that, uh, impression. 
[00:36:00]  But that's your broad, man.  That's your girl.  Yeah, you know, but I could see crap when I look at it.  Mm-hmm.  You know.  I'm not just gonna stick up for one side.  I'll Obama bash a little later.  Well, of course you will.  It is Thursday.  In the privacy of my own car.  Where I could say what I want.  All right.  So we got, we got athletes, uh, acting very, very badly.  Mm.  Uh, we move on with, uh, Magic Johnson today.  Uh-oh.  Yes, listen to this.  The Converse Weapon, that's the shoot. 
[00:36:30]  That's Magic do what he was born to do.  Maybe so, but that's not all.  They let Isaiah play like he's ten feet tall.  Or the kind of moves that never fail.  The Weapon's the choice of Kevin McHale.  The same is true for Mark McGuire.  When I wear Weapon, I'm on fire.  Well, what can the Weapons do for King?  Well, I can do just about anything.  You already know what you did for me.  What?  I walked away with the MVP.  The Converse Weapon.  The number one weapon in the NBA.  That was more like bad singing than a bad rap song. 
[00:37:00]  Probably 86, something like that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, you got Kevin McHale in there.  I wear my Converse with my shades.  That's hilarious.  I just fill in the rest.  My shades.  No, you finish it.  People are going to finish it.  No.  You.  No.  Isaiah Thomas, though, before his bigger thing.  Oh, yeah.  And what was that?  McGuire was in there, too? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bernard King, I think, was in there.  Yeah, that's old school.  Really old.  I don't know if we should have.  Where's, ah, E-Rock.  Well, whatever.  E-Rock found that one?  Yeah.  Yeah, he highlighted it.  Can you ask him?  Well, he highlighted it like it's one of the better ones.  There we go.  Uh-oh.  Where's Hoagie Boy?  Yeah, Hoagie Boy.  Come on in.  Hoagie Boy.  All right, let's move on to Pete Rose for Aqua Velva.  Hey, oh, E-Rock, why?  Oh, Jesus.  Why that one?  Because in the video, they're all wrapping, and they're posing with their sneakers, and 
[00:38:00]  they're doing these spin moves as they're, it's one person wraps, spins away, and then  the other one comes in.  But in relation to radio.  Yeah, this is radio.  Yeah, but it's still awful.  But this is radio.  Yeah, so a visual thing.  We're all sitting here uncomfortable because that one didn't work.  It's radio.  Okay.  It's radio.  It doesn't have pictures.  We have this segment we're doing where, like, we all, worst art, where we all just  look at it on the radio.  Oh, he just rolled his eyes.  Oh, he likes rolling his eyes.  I'm sure there's some... 
[00:38:30]  All right, now I don't have confidence in the bit, though.  He rolls his eyes, we eye his rolls.  It's all the fat jokes.  It's just awful.  You would think you'd be, like, anorexic by this point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would be about 115 pounds by now.  Yeah.  All right, thanks.  He just stares there with nothing to say. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, E-Rock.  And then he just slumps out of the studio.  We love you.  Looking for his next hoagie.  We were listening to one...  I was listening to something on XMLS, one of the old replays, where they had one of E-Rock's  stories.  Oh, no.  Where he got, like, one of the lines of the day, because his story, it was so awful.  It was like...  And then she gets out of the car, and the cop's like, but this is not you.  And he goes, yeah, but it doesn't look...  Oh, he's telling the story about his girlfriend's friend at the concert with the idea that didn't  work.  He goes, yeah, but it doesn't look like you.  This isn't your age.  And then nothing. 
[00:39:30]  It was horrendous.  And we gave him one of the lines of the day just to leave him...  Oh.  ...his story stuck.  Oh, man.  Kind of like mine relaying that.  Yeah, well...  Wow.  Here's Pete Rose for Aqua...  Aqua Velva?  Yeah.  Hi, pregnant women.  Drink Aqua Velva so your kids can have my hair cut.  Pete Rose for Aqua Velva.  No.  Hey, Pete Rose. 
[00:40:00]  What's a man really want from his aftershave?  No fancy perfumes.  Or fancy bottles.  Or fancy prices.  Uh-uh.  A man wants to smell like a man.  That's why I like Aqua Velva.  It seems so refreshing and masculine.  And masculine.  We should just take the word like out of that.  A man wants to smell a man.  Smell a man.  Uh-uh.  A man wants to smell like a man.  That's why I like Aqua Velva. 
[00:40:30]  It seems so refreshing and masculine.  That's right.  A man wants to...  Feel like a man.  Yeah.  Feel like a man.  Oh, a man wants to...  Line?  Aqua Velva man.  Yuck.  Great.  Why do these guys do this?  An aqua-headed man.  That's great.  That's a good one.  That's all right.  Should have been highlighted. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, that one's highlighted.  Hoagie boy.  And because they know he's a bad actor, they have him hitting balls in between each side  to distract you a little bit.  Hey, Pete Rose!  What's a man really want from an aftershave?  Not fancy perfume.  Or fancy bottles.  Not fancy prices.  No!  A man wants to smell like a man.  There's something about Aqua Velva.  He wants to be cool and refreshed.  There's something about...  Oh my God, is he singing?  Aqua Velva.  A man wants to feel like a man. 
[00:41:30]  Feel like a man.  Cause there's something about an aqua-headed man.  Wow.  I remember that commercial, though.  Yikes.  A man wants to smell like a man.  Wouldn't you just, like...  Get...  Ball bag?  It's just...  A man doesn't want to smell like a man.  Wouldn't you just rub your own ball bag?  You know what I...  Yeah, just kind of, you know, rub manly-smelling musky parts of men's bodies on you. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Ew.  Wow.  Like, do you want to smell like a man?  A little behind your ear.  You know what I mean?  That's the dumbest, dumbest tagline ever.  Well, that was during the day of the macho, manly thing that was going on.  Yeah.  Maybe Rambo was number one at the movies.  Well, it was 1976.  Oh, it was?  That was?  Yes.  Wow.  All right.  Vic Tabak.  Disco.  Was in that. 
[00:42:30]  Vic Tabak?  Yeah, Vic Tabak.  Wow.  Was helping Pete Rose sing.  Ooh.  Exactly.  Was that before Alice?  I think it was just...  It had to be the same time where they wouldn't have gotten Vic Tabak.  I think Alice started in 76 or something like that.  Yeah, they wouldn't have got them because I don't think...  There it is.  Ice blue, aqua velvet aftershave.  I was talking about a commercial...  I know this isn't a sports thing.  It's a little tangent, but commercial for a product called Compose.  Do you remember this stuff?  Hey, anyone remember this? 
[00:43:00]  It was a pill, which is pretty much an over-the-counter...  It's a tranquilizer.  And there was always some woman, and she was losing her effing mind because her daughter  was being married, or there was a problem with the housekeeping, and she was like, I  just can't say it anymore.  And the husband would gently grab the wife's chin, look her in the eye and go, honey, you  need Compose.  And she'd open up a bottle of Compose, take a couple of pills, and then they'd show her 
[00:43:30]  just smiling, going, this is the best wedding ever.  And it was Compose.  It was valuable.  It was like an over-the-counter tranquilizer for crazy, emotional bitches that the husband...  And it was never the guy.  The guy never needed Compose.  It was always the out-of-control, emotional, bitchy wife that needed Compose.  And it was spelled like C-O-M-P-O-Z.  Yeah, yeah.  Compose.  Can we get those commercials?  Oh, please.  And can we find out what was in Compose?  Yeah, what the hell was in there? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, there was some marijuana or something.  Marijuana.  Marijuana?  Yeah.  We have part of E-Rock's story that Jim mentioned.  Is it worth playing there, Danny?  If it goofs on E-Rock, it's worth it.  Yeah.  This is the line of the day that Jim had mentioned.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, we like to give out line of the day.  And, well, usually it's a big laugh.  It's a big home run.  E-Rock's stories are better than Compose.  Well, we decided to give E-Rock one of the day for this.  And he's looking at her license and saying, this isn't you, this isn't you. 
[00:44:30]  And she's getting all upset and saying, yes, it's me.  How is this not me?  And then he looks at her and says, okay, this is you, but this isn't your age.  So she starts screaming at him like, how is this not my age?  Finally, he doesn't want to deal with it.  He gets us drinks.  That was it.  That was the whole story.  Yeah.  Stunk.  Oh, he and a U.  He was trying right to the end, though.  Step it aside.  877-212-ONA. 
[00:45:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  How's everyone today?  Well, that's good.  Opie and Anthony.  We're not feeling this bit, huh?  Sometimes we get in these weird situations here.  I say that.  Not everything's radio gold.  We thought we had a really solid bit, and it's falling apart on us here.  What, the sports figures?  Yeah.  Acting?  Yeah.  Hmm. 
[00:45:30]  How about we bring Dumbbell in here and let him pick one that he thinks is good?  Because Eric picked these out.  Hoagie boy.  Yeah, how about we have him tip forward walk, which is what he does?  Yeah.  He really is looking like, he's like Elvis right before that final fried peanut butter and banana  sandwich.  Stupid front-loaded torso.  We were very excited about this bit, and now, E-Rock, we're feeling...  We don't know yet.  Yeah.  Feeling a little apprehensive.  Here, I give you the disc of athletes acting badly or singing badly. 
[00:46:00]  I want you to pick one out to save this bit.  Pick out the best one.  The bestest best.  The one that E-Rock, using all his professional know-how, thinks is the best one.  I want you to use all your talent and skill.  I'd say 19.  19.  It was an actual movie trailer.  Oh, boy.  That's the one we just listened to.  We just listened to it, and it sucked.  And that's the...  I swear to God, E-Rock, you couldn't pick a worse track, because we're all... 
[00:46:30]  That was the one that really buried it, like, all right, let's move on.  Yeah, that's the one we were listening to during break, going, you know what?  This just isn't going to work.  Wow, E-Rock.  Why did you pick that one?  Because it was a professionally made movie during the 70s, and the trailer was just so  awful.  Rosie Greer was just really bad in it.  Yeah, the thing with two heads.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Or you can do the very last one there, which is a local cable commercial.  Oh, okay.  All righty.  That's something we haven't previewed. 
[00:47:00]  E-Rock gives his seal of approval.  All right.  Who is it?  Can you say that?  That's Zol...  Zol...  Zomai...  What?  Yeah.  Who?  Someone from the Detroit Tigers.  Oh, okay.  All right, here we go.  And now, another Comcast Consumer Update.  I'm here with the league's fastest pitcher, Detroit's own Joel Zomaiya.  103, that's fast.  Thanks, Comcast High Speed Internet, that's smoking fast.  Thanks.  And now with Power Boost, you can get an extra surge of power for downloading up to twice  as fast.  Twice as fast?  That's like throwing 206 miles an hour.  Is the competition that fast? 
[00:47:30]  Well, let's just say they only throw slow curveballs.  This has been a Comcast Consumer Update.  All right, he's pretty bad.  I'll give him that, but...  Huh.  Hmm.  E-Rock, comment?  Nope.  They're not all going to be gems, huh, E-Rock?  No.  No.  But see, you get to hide in an office, and we have to be on the air going, ah, now what? 
[00:48:00]  I have one more thing if you want that.  Uh-oh.  Wow, he's got a backup plan.  This is Michael Jordan's voiceover outtakes for Gatorade.  Oh, I think we played that already.  Yeah, we've played that already.  Yeah.  And it fell flat, too.  Yeah.  You're having a bad day, huh?  I think every radio show in the country has played that one.  Yeah.  Every single one.  How about this one?  Before I swing for the bleacher CDs, I get to eaties for my Wheaties.  CDs? 
[00:48:30]  Before I slam my gorilla donkey.  I get to eaties for my Wheaties.  Before I put on my little Peaties, I get to eaties for my Wheaties.  What about my watch?  Part of your good breakfast.  Tidy-Whities.  He's changing in a locker room.  Peaties, I thought.  His little Peaties.  He puts on his little Peaties.  Oh, Peaties?  Peaties?  What the hell is that?  He's standing up from a bench in the locker room pulling up these tighty-whity underwears  as he's singing about Wheaties.  Is his name Pete?  Uh, it's Daryl Dawkins. 
[00:49:00]  He used to break the net.  That was his big thing.  He used to break the backboard.  Oh, yeah.  He did.  They had to make those backboards a lot stronger because of him.  Ed White from the Chargers and Ron Say.  Danny wants to know if we want him to try and redo the bit and make it funny.  Wow.  That's a brave move.  What happened to, like, the odd couple guest spots, right?  The odd couple.  Yes.  Yeah, the Brady Bunch.  I'm Deacon Jones. 
[00:49:30]  Mr. Ed.  Mr. Ed.  We want, like, them trying to act.  My mother the car.  On sitcoms.  Monsters.  And comedy shows, yeah.  That's my mama.  That's my mama.  That was coming to America.  Randall Watson.  He played a cop on That's My Mama.  It was a big TV credit.  Yeah, yeah.  In the What's Happening episode of That's My Mama, the What's Going Down episode of That's  My Mama.  What's Going Down episode.  Well, we got Michael Jordan outtakes. 
[00:50:00]  Ready?  Action.  Gatorade, is it in you?  Gatorade, is it in you?  Gatorade, is it in you?  That's great.  Wait.  No.  Gatorade.  Mayonnaise.  Is it in you?  Yeah, we played this already.  Yeah.  And it's just him doing that.  It's annoying.  Over and over and over again.  You?  That's great.  Wait.  Gatorade.  That's great.  Is it in you?  Right.  Ready?  Is it in you? 
[00:50:30]  Ready?  Gatorade, is it in you?  No.  Gatorade, is it in you?  Gatorade, is it?  Gatorade, is it in you?  Nope.  Right.  This is all he has to say?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Is it in you?  Nope.  One more time.  Try the last way you just said it.  Just conversational.  Gatorade, is it in you?  All right.  Ready?  Gatorade, is it in you?  No. 
[00:51:00]  No.  Oh, no, you dummy.  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  Gatorade, is it in you?  Okay.  Try it differently where you do the accent on another thing.  Okay.  Gatorade, is it in you?  No, no, no.  Don't go up at the end.  Okay.  Gatorade, is it in you?  No, you dummy.  More conversational.  Yeah.  Oh, conversational.  Okay.  Gatorade, is it in you?  It's the same delivery, you dumb. 
[00:51:30]  Ready?  On action.  Gatorade, is it in you?  No.  Gatorade, is it in you?  No.  Gatorade, is it in you?  No.  That's right.  Wait.  Gatorade.  I got to hear you.  Is it in you?  Right.  Ready?  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  Ready?  Gatorade, is it in you?  No.  It is.  Stupid son of a bitch.  All right, this is getting funny.  All right.  No, you got to accent the it.  It.  Is it in you?  And bring down the you.  That's all you need to do here.  Is it in you? 
[00:52:00]  No.  Gatorade, is it in you?  Gatorade, is it in you?  All right, you got the it part.  Oh, wow.  Is it in you?  Gatorade, is it?  Gatorade, is it in you?  One more time.  One more.  Last week just said it, just conversational.  Gatorade, is it in you?  All right, ready?  Gatorade, is it in you?  Same thing to me.  Gatorade.  Gatorade, is it in you? 
[00:52:30]  Gatorade.  Gatorade, is it in you?  Okay, you ready?  Gatorade, is it in you?  No, don't like that.  Gatorade, is it in you?  Okay.  Gatorade, is it in you?  That is.  You did a couple of great ones.  I love you, really, sports for Gatorade.  Oh, they just got to kiss his ass.  You did a couple of great ones.  You did a couple of great ones there.  Yeah, did you?  It's hard when you're talking to, arguably, the greatest player to ever play basketball. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  And he's just mushing through what you know is a dumb line.  Easy.  And it's like, who cares?  Yeah.  It's Jordan.  You can't argue the fact.  Greatest player ever.  Michael Jordan.  I would argue that, but I would put Magic with him, because Magic played every position.  Jordan, Jordan's a great scorer of all time, maybe, but...  Yeah, let me tell you something about Jordan.  He won Defensive Player of the Year many, many years, my friend.  But people don't remember that, because he knew how to shoot the rock there, Jim.  But I would still put Magic up there.  I would say you could make an argument for Magic. 
[00:53:30]  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  AIDS.  Is it in you?  James Worthy, because he would get prostitutes and then shoot.  I love Big Game James.  Big Game James.  They called him stupid, stiff-armed...  He had this really weird way of shooting.  I love those old Lakers, man.  Kareem and stupid Kurt Rambis and Michael Cooper with his creepy African socks.  He wore African socks?  No, he looked like an African sock. 
[00:54:00]  He was a weird guy.  Dirty Magic and Hooker-Lovin' Big Game James.  Why do they all wear the tiny, like, shorts, though?  When you see that old NBA footage, it's creepy.  I'm amazed that ball bags weren't, like, flipping out every time they jumped up in the air for a rebound.  We got Shaq.  We're going to try.  We're trying now.  Shaq acting.  This is what we were looking for.  Googly-eyed Shaq.  Remember the movie Steel back in 1997? 
[00:54:30]  Um, no.  Exactly.  Well, Shaq was attempting to be, what, a multi-faceted performer?  Yes, I think he wanted to get into a little acting.  Yeah, well, here's Shaq testifying in court after a military training exercise goes bad.  Uh-oh.  When he managed to remove the concrete...  That doesn't sound like Shaq.  Wow.  He wanted to just be himself.  Yeah.  Sounded pretty good, actually.  When he managed to remove the concrete, what did you find? 
[00:55:00]  The senator had been killed, sir.  Lieutenant Sparks?  Dad!  She had a severe spinal injury.  And her legs had been crushed.  She may never walk again.  Oh, God.  I can imagine how difficult it must have been for you.  And Louis Beans.  Can you imagine if Vos had played that husband yesterday?  Oh, God.  That's my wife! 
[00:55:30]  Are we getting that audio?  Are you hitting on my wife?  Shaq's testimony continues, showing his wide range of emotion.  We've heard the testimony that you shouted out to Lieutenant Burke just before he fired.  Did you see how the weapon was calibrated?  Yes, sir.  What intensity level was set?  The maximum, sir.  A parameter that had never been tested.  Or even approved for testing.  Is that correct?  Yes, sir.  Burke knew what he was doing.  Oh, is that? 
[00:56:00]  Who recalibrated the weapon?  Lieutenant, who did it?  Burke did it, sir.  Thank you, Lieutenant.  That's all.  Yeah, that's all.  Please step down and off the set.  Wow.  Yeah.  Those are not hard lines to do.  Basic lines, right, Jimmy?  Yes, sir.  Maximum setting.  Shaq gets face-to-face with Judd Nelson.  The two exchange some harsh words.  This is after the court thing.  Thanks for selling me out, brother soldier.  I'm on my face with that. 
[00:56:30]  What you did was foul.  I should bust your ass for what you did to spark it.  Bust my ass?  Do you know where I was headed?  Do you know what I could have done with those military resources?  You stupid.  Oh.  You stupid wuss.  Yeah, exactly.  You stupid wuss.  Very dramatic role.  You stupid wuss.  That was the scene in The Breakfast Club we didn't see, where Shaq drags Judd Nelson into  the coat room by his face and rapes him until the principal comes and stops him. 
[00:57:00]  And Ali Sheedy eats a booger.  Wow.  What a quirky group.  Ugh.  Aw.  Weren't they all of us, though?  Yeah, they did kind of represent.  Shut up.  Except he was too dangerous, Judd, with the bandanas tied.  Remember that?  Oh.  Oh, the bandana tied around his leg or whatever it was, and wow, is he dangerous.  The awful 80s bad guy, like an escape from New York.  The guy who was the Duke of New York's assistant, with the white guy with the Billy Idol hair.  Touch me, he dies. 
[00:57:30]  You're not out in a minute, he dies.  Shut up.  Didn't look very tough.  No.  Oh, when he puts the diamond earring in.  Yeah, at the end, he's a tough guy.  Oh, this is...  Oh, yeah.  Great.  I think we could all relate to one of those characters.  Right.  Who were you in the breakfast club, Opie?  Obviously, uh...  Molly Ringwald?  Yeah, obviously, Molly Ringwald.  I'm the kid who got his ass hair ripped off.  Who's not even in the movie? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Just spoken about.  That's all.  I'm Emilio Estevez's cousin.  Well, that was the beauty of the movie.  Yeah.  Everyone could relate to one of the characters.  Unless you're black.  Jesus.  Well, that's true.  Oh, yeah.  Well...  Yeah, they kind of took a vacation from the movies back in the 80s like that.  Oh, my God.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I still like Harry Dean Stanton in Pretty in Pink.  How creepy he was.  What a ghoul father.  Because he'd lay there on his side with his robe and his legs open waiting for his daughter 
[00:58:30]  to come home and talk about her date.  Watch Pretty in Pink.  Yeah.  What a creephole Harry Dean Stanton is.  He really is bad in that show.  I'm amazed...  Did you kiss him?  I'm amazed they cast him in that role.  He's a weirdo.  Yeah.  If you know anything about...  Yeah.  He's just a raging alcoholic out there in Hollywood.  I think that's what I hear.  And just...  That's what I hear from his friends.  From his liver, who I email with.  I get help me emails from his liver every once in a while.  One more bad Shaq line here. 
[00:59:00]  Shaq has some defiant words for his commanding officer.  Uh-oh.  We've created a whole new generation of weaponry here.  We can't turn our backs on this kind of potential firepower.  Maybe you can't.  But after what happened to Sparks, I can.  Sir.  Was that Bo Svensson?  You know, they remade this movie and...  Who was that guy?  I don't know.  They renamed this movie and remade this movie and called it Iron Man.  This is the Iron Man plot.  I didn't see it. 
[00:59:30]  Is it really?  You haven't seen Iron Man?  I have not seen it.  I watched it last night.  Oh, my God.  Way better than Batman.  Was it really?  Way better.  I'll see it.  It's an amazing movie.  Can I tell you, though?  It's funny.  We're on that subject.  I was Rickrolled about eight times looking up Heath Ledger Joker clips.  It's funny every time you get Rickrolled.  Batman in HD one of nine.  And you click it on.  And then that stupid Rick Ashley.  And he kept getting me.  And I just kept laughing. 
[01:00:00]  Nice.  Yeah, I was watching...  That's all I care about in The Dark Knight.  Everyone cares, but he led it.  Yeah.  I was trying to find new scenes that might have found their way on YouTube.  And they have the interrogation scene, which was good.  Oh, they do?  With Batman, yeah.  Yeah, he was so good.  Yeah, I'm going to go see that movie again.  But Iron Man is a better flick.  In the Breakfast Club, E-Rock relates to the breakfast.  Very funny.  Yeah, right on.  Where's Steve today? 
[01:00:30]  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  Yes.  He's doing his thing somewhere.  He came in with two copies of Rent Boys.  Of course he did.  Two copies.  His own copy and then the other copy in case some of his pages are stuck together.  Yes.  Probably all are.  We're going to take a break and continue.  Opie and Anthony, we'll go to the phones next, see what the folks are up to today.  877-212-O-N-A.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:01:00]  What else is going on in the world today?  Someone's calling me an effing idiot.  Steel was based on a Superman spinoff after Superman was killed by Doomsday.  Oh, I remember that.  I want to thank Tony Q for that knowledge.  No one saw Steel.  That's the problem.  Sorry, I based what I said on a 15-second clip very similar to Iron Man that I saw last night. 
[01:01:30]  Beat yourself up.  How many people saw Steel, really?  I didn't.  Anthony sees every movie that comes out, basically.  You never saw Steel.  Eventually, I do see every movie that comes out.  And did you know that Steel was about Superman and all that?  Uh, no.  I really didn't.  And Anthony knows everything.  And I know everything.  877-212-O-N-A.  You got the O'Neills arrested at home for possession of meth.  What the hell's going on there?  Huh?  Patrice, I'm really disappointed. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, let's think about it.  Why would I do meth?  Oh, Patrice impression.  And what do you know on this Ryan O'Neill thing?  I know that he got arrested because it's like a parole violation.  Good, good, good.  They were in his house, kind of poking around.  Found something in his living area, they said.  They hadn't done tests on it, but they believe it's crystal meth.  Uh-huh.  And him and his son were arrested, at least on something like 10 grand bail. 
[01:02:30]  Uh, and then the daughter also, Tatum, recently, I guess over the summer.  She had a little run-in with some cocaine.  She was safe from a relapse.  Mm.  Right.  That's what she's saying, right?  Yeah, I believe her.  You believe her?  Yeah.  Natalie's sober and she just, one of those weird things where, man, you really, you jumped  off the building and the wind blew you back on real quick.  Oof.  You got lucky.  Wow.  Yeah?  Yeah, terrible example, but you know what I mean.  Well, she, uh, she's also suggesting that, uh, you know, her father and brother really  need some of that rehab. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  She believes in the whole, uh, the program and, and, and thinks they really need to  just...  That family is so screwy.  Just, uh, get into the program.  Her book had some crazy crap in it.  You read it?  She was doing...  No, I read excerpts.  I don't read.  Uh, just for the show.  But apparently, you know, she was drugging and sexually active at, like,  10.  I mean, I did these big parties that were going on and everything.  So she was all effed up. 
[01:03:30]  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, yeah, that's how, that's how the drugs come into play.  You must kill the pain.  And then, uh, her father, I guess, was always kind of into drugs.  And, uh, now the son is.  Good.  Good job.  That guy's quite a dad.  Dad of the year.  Yeah.  And then they got to put all kinds of things in the article about how...  And, uh, both of them starred in Paper Moon, where Tate O'Neill was the  youngest, uh, to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. 
[01:04:00]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I heard Ryan was so pissed off because she was outshining him.  Like, that was a big role for him.  And just his dumb kid was stealing a spotlight.  That movie is probably, and it's, it's awful because she was such a little  kid, uh, it was probably her best work ever.  And, and it's done at like eight.  Mm-hmm.  At eight years old, you've done the best work you're ever going to do in  your life.  That'll turn you on to drugs pretty quickly. 
[01:04:30]  She's great in that movie.  It's hysterical.  Is it a comedy?  Uh, it, yeah, yeah, it's kind of, it's a comedy, but also has its, you  know, serious moments.  But she's hysterical in it.  She's just laying there, smoking, cursing.  Anytime kids curse in movies, I find it hysterically funny.  I just, I like when kids, uh, curse in front of their parents and the  parents start laughing, but they're trying to reprimand the kid and, hey,  watch your mouth.  But it's just funny as hell to hear the F word pop out of a kid's mouth. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Amongst other things.  Of course, had to go there.  It's before eight.  She was good in, uh, Little Darlings, too, with Armand Asante.  Ah, yes.  Before we knew Christy McNichol.  Yes.  The mullet.  That boy.  Yeah.  The young boy, Christy McNichol.  She had a haircut like an Asian boy.  Yeah.  Kind of like a, a bit of a bowl cut.  She, uh, yeah, well, you know, Gay Richard, my, uh, my homosexual friend that is, uh, dead.  Well, you know what? 
[01:05:30]  He wasn't your friend anymore when you realized he was gay.  Um, well, I, that was the turning point of your friendship.  I was coming back to New York at that point.  So I kind of, yeah, distanced myself when in the tree fort, he, uh, whispered, uh, when  we were having a little, uh, sleep out at the tree fort, when he whispered that, you  know, I, I want to suck your.  I was like, well, what, what did he just say? 
[01:06:00]  You know, cause we'd hung out plenty of times, drank beers, you know, shoot guns, just things  like that.  And then out of the, out of the blue, he just decides that, uh, you know, he wants to do  a favor for me.  So I, I just turned, I was turned toward the wall of the tree fort and I just made believe  I was asleep as many people know the story, but, um, but, uh, he, you never saw him again  after that.  No, I saw him a little awkward. 
[01:06:30]  I remember that offer you made me last night.  Let's go fishing.  What, what made it awkward that he was gay or that he, uh, made a move on you?  Like if I wouldn't care if he, if he didn't make the move on you, but you found out he  was gay, could you still be friends with him?  Yeah, it wouldn't have been a problem.  I was friends with him and he was gay until he, you know.  But you didn't know.  I had my sinking suspicions.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, he was never into like girls.  What were your sinking suspicions based on? 
[01:07:00]  Like when you'd go fishing and you'd say, let's grab our pulse, what he would do.  And that's really him.  That's there's young Richard.  Jesus.  He was, I don't know how you resisted.  I know.  Look at him.  His pouty lips.  Yeah.  Is it?  Dead eyes.  Is he dead?  He's dead.  Oof.  Of what?  AIDS.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Died of the AIDS back in like 2000, I think 2000, something like that. 
[01:07:30]  2001.  That looks like a modern picture.  He's a, yeah.  Well, he was a model.  He, you know, after I came back to New York, he went on to become a model, very popular.  Uh, and he was Christy McNichols beard when they would go out because she was popular  in the show family, I guess at the time.  And she would go out and he would go out with her to try to break the rumors that she  was a lesbian.  I never heard this before.  Yeah.  That's what he would, you know, go out with her. 
[01:08:00]  Look for some photos or something for Christy McNichols with the seventies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you'll give my pop and see, uh, old Richard.  His name is Richard Lee.  They called him, but his real name was Richard Schepinski.  I think Schepinski is more showbizy.  Shorten it to Lee and make it more relatable of the favorite Schepinski acting family.  Schepinski had two really hot sisters too.  Those typical blonde California looking girls, two sisters that were just stunning. 
[01:08:30]  Did you have a shot at them?  No, they were older than me.  Yeah.  But they were like, we lived in the same apartment complex and, uh, there was a community  pool in the, uh, apartment complex.  And the girls that were there were just amazing.  And I was constantly chasing tail and, uh, he just not interested, not interested.  Hot girls would, and they were clamoring over him.  Girls loved this guy.  And everyone thought he was just playing hard again.  And I'm like, I'm like, what's wrong with you? 
[01:09:00]  I'm sitting there.  I am the dumbest ass in the world.  He, I, I, I become friends with some guy who's like, uh, uh, got the looks girls are  just dying over.  And there I am a face full of zits.  I, I, I, I, I had to like talk my way into everything.  I had to use personality and this guy just steps up and all the girls run over to him  and, uh, he's a homo.  I'm like, Hey girls, you know, what about me?  I might use a tanker full of clearasil, but you know, at least I'm interested. 
[01:09:30]  I'll get the job done.  I'll, I'll help you out.  At least I won't yell yuck when you show it to me.  Yeah, exactly.  And then like other, we'd be hanging out with other guys and stuff and they'd ask him questions  like, you know, dude, that chick is so into you.  You know, what are you doing?  And he goes, ah, you know, I'm not into her or I'm looking for some, she's not that hot.  And meanwhile, she's, you know, hot when, when you were in school, like, uh, I don't 
[01:10:00]  even want to say high school, but like junior high school, were you aware of the gay?  Oh yeah.  I so wasn't.  I thought, I thought it was such a rare species.  No, I thought it was such a rare thing.  I wasn't aware of the gay.  And then you get knowledge later in life and then you go back, you go back in your mind  and think about stuff in like junior high and you go, Oh my God.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, gay.  That guy was so gay.  But when you were living in the moment, going to school with some of these people, I had  no clue.  That's how naive I was.  Yeah.  I lived a sheltered life. 
[01:10:30]  My, my stupid mom worried about me being out too late.  Couldn't learn about anything.  I had no idea.  Yeah.  No, there was a guy that was around.  There was a guy on our track and field team.  He was the only one that was into the speed walking thing, which looks so gay.  Yeah, it does.  And he was really good at it with the swivel hip thing.  Oof.  I'm just looking, thinking, man, maybe, maybe I should have put them for the goop.  I was just looking.  Right.  Danny put the picture of Richard back up and it's like, yeah, probably should have. 
[01:11:00]  He's like standing there in a sweater and he's kind of like looking at the head, the  side head tilt.  I can't not look at him.  He looks like, he looks like he would have been cast in 90210 or something, right?  Oh yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  I don't know where his, uh.  Or the Hills or one of those dumb shows.  I don't know.  Where his acting career went wrong or bad or something.  Or eventually it was 90210.  Uh oh.  Oh no.  It was his T cell count.  90210. 
[01:11:30]  Went to, went nine, went to zero.  Then there was hope with the two.  Oh one.  Oh no.  Oh boy.  Did you just Google Richard Lee?  Yeah, nothing.  Richard Lee.  Common name, right?  Well yeah, and then you get a lot of like Asian modeling sides.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah.  But uh, yeah, he wound up dying.  Well I saw him, the last time I saw him was in 1988, I think.  We all, me, my brother, a bunch of our friends went out to California, go uh, visit uh, Pops 
[01:12:00]  out there on the ranch.  And uh, Richard was still out there.  Um, he was living like in Lake Elsinore, California, but he had come over uh, to see, you know, all  of us and everything.  And we were going out hunting.  So we were, you know, all geared up with the shotguns and we were going to do some hunting  and stuff.  And he decided, uh, he didn't want to go hunting.  So he went with, uh, my, my father's wife, uh, Corey to do some curtain shopping.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's uh. 
[01:12:30]  Wow.  So at that point, me and uh, my friend Joe Curry looked at each other and was just like,  okay, I guess that gay didn't wear off over time.  I guess it wasn't a phase.  Joe Curry known?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  How?  Joe Curry's from here.  Uh, well, he was Joe Curry, good pal of mine.  We all went out to California, uh, together to do some hunting and driving and looking  for big trucks and looking for chicks and looking for the broads.  Yeah.  We had a good time.  We all, a bunch of my friends, uh, went out there ranch.  We called it ranching.  Yeah.  Just went out there, men riding horses, hunting. 
[01:13:00]  Damn it.  Drinking.  Good times.  I got to correct someone on instant feedback.  Opie wanted to stay out late and learn about the gay.  No, that's not what I'm getting at.  Wait a minute.  My mom was, uh, overprotective.  I had a ridiculous curfew.  I couldn't do anything.  What time was your curfew?  I just wanted to learn about life.  What time was your curfew?  I didn't know about racism.  I didn't know.  I didn't know about anything.  I led a sheltered life.  Oh, my curfew in high school was 11.  It was ridiculous.  You had a curfew?  Oh my God. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  That's where I'm getting at.  I didn't learn about like life until I went away to school.  I was not street smart whatsoever growing up.  No street savvy?  Not at all, man.  Yeah.  I didn't, I didn't know.  I didn't know about anything.  I was from the school of hard knocks.  I learned early.  I didn't know about, I didn't know about black.  I didn't know about anything.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Well, protected, sheltered.  Pretty sheltered.  Absolutely.  I had a curfew too, though.  930, Jim.  I still remember my friend Dean mocking me. 
[01:14:00]  How old?  27.  No, but I was like, yeah, all my friends used to stay out until 11 or 12.  It was 930.  You know, I still found time to sneak under a porch and exchange favors.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  My mother had to raise the three of us, so she was working all the time.  She worked at a disco called Chaz out on Long Island.  She was a cocktail waitress.  So she wasn't coming home until all hours.  And we, there was no curfew. 
[01:14:30]  There was no, we ran the joint.  You were one of those kids that got to do whatever the hell you wanted.  Up until all hours out.  I was jealous of you guys, man.  Smoking weed.  Jealous of you guys.  Like, you probably had a car at 15, even though you didn't even have a driver's license.  No, I had my license.  I had my California driver's license.  Right.  I used to love those kids.  You know, I would be all, like, you know, showered and ready for school.  And kids like you would come in like just a mess.  Like, they never even went home.  No.  Yeah, completely. 
[01:15:00]  Just stoned.  Wake and bake.  Go to school without books or that.  And I was the guy in class.  You got a piece of paper and a pen or pencil or something.  And the teacher would yell at me, like, what are you going to do with that?  What are you going to do with the paper?  Are you going to put it in a notebook?  Or is it just going to get folded up in your pocket and go through the wash?  Don't reprimand me in front of the class.  Didn't you try to make your read and you were like Leroy from Fame?  Leroy joke. 
[01:15:30]  Wow.  That's good.  Yeah, you were like a little.  It's Tweety, man.  You were living like a cowboy.  Different guy.  I know.  I just thought that was a funny scene in the classroom.  Yeah, you were a little bird.  Yeah, they had to have the little Jewish kid read.  Who's Warren Jerome?  It's Tweety.  Hey, um.  Meanwhile, Tweety was a rapist in jail.  Yeah, who cares?  Good.  Tweety's dead.  Stupid Tweety.  We could talk to the crab apple broad today.  You want to do it or what?  More than I want to breathe.  Is it going to be the one, though, Stump Brain? 
[01:16:00]  How do we get her to say can't?  We really got to think of that.  Okay, so they could or?  So could they transplant the tree?  That's the goal.  Maybe a little.  So you're saying they can't?  Can you do this?  No, I can't.  Can you?  Yeah, we need her to say that.  We'll get her.  We'll get her.  Oh, we'll get her.  All right.  Well, the story, got to thank Mike, the board op, the board op up there in Boston at BCN. 
[01:16:30]  And he found this gem, a great story in Shrewsbury.  Three old broads, an apartment complex, a crab apple tree.  And they're guarding the crab apple tree because they don't want them to cut the crab apple tree down.  Oh, heavens no.  To put a dumpster in its place because I guess the apartment complex needs a dumpster and they got to put it somewhere.  Yeah.  And it's this lame ass tree all by itself in this apartment complex.  Lame.  And they're using, like, lawn furniture and a tiny little, like, twine to tie themselves together. 
[01:17:00]  But then yesterday we called this Ethel and she was sleeping.  Ethel.  She wasn't guarding the crab apple tree.  No.  And here's our best clip from the story.  There was a bunch of them, but this one is our best for obvious reasons as they explain their plight up there in Shrewsbury.  And while safety is certainly a big concern for these ladies, they say there's got to be a better option than cutting down a tree.  And I can't see why they can't fix the dumpster, why they can't fix the pad. 
[01:17:30]  I mean, I'd like to know them to tell me why they can't fix the pad.  All it is is a cement pad.  I'm sure if I was young, I could fix it.  Yeah.  Just amazing.  Now, what's in that clip that we haven't really acknowledged?  There's some guy kind of laughing.  Yeah, there's like a...  Is that the reporter?  Realizing what's going down?  I don't know.  Yeah, someone chuckled in there.  Yeah.  Well, we're getting Ethel on the phone right now to see how the crab apple tree thing is going. 
[01:18:00]  Travis is dialing the number.  Oh.  It's ringing.  We're waiting.  All right.  I think we got her.  All right.  Be nice.  Yeah, no, I think it's good that they did that.  I mean, sometimes you got to...  If you have an issue with something, you have to take the fight to City Hall, as they say.  Jimmy, sometimes you got to make a stand for what you believe in, and nothing but the  utmost respect for these three ladies making a stand for something they believe in.  It's wonderful, I believe. 
[01:18:30]  More people should do it.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Ethel.  Yes?  Welcome to the radio show.  How are you?  Ethel.  Oh, I'm fine today, thank you.  Oh, very good.  Very good.  Now, Ethel, we've been watching your plight here, your battle to save a crab apple tree  in your apartment complex.  Right, yes.  Yes.  Could you take us through the whole story for the people that might be hearing it for the  first time?  Yes.  How did it start?  Oh, well, it started that we were told that, you know, the apple tree was coming down to 
[01:19:00]  move a dumpster, which the cement block had, you know, deteriorated.  Oh, goodness.  And it needed to be fixed.  So they're having a dedication for a Mr. Ricker up here.  So I guess they wanted to rush it through, and they thought we probably wouldn't even notice.  Oh, but you girls are sharp.  I know.  You noticed.  The trucks came up, and we were out there in a flash, and we just sat there, and the  trucks left, and we just continued to sit there. 
[01:19:30]  But then we had a meeting last night.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  How'd that go?  Yesterday lunchtime, rather.  It went very well, and I think they realize now that, you know, it's something they shouldn't  have done.  So can they still cut this tree down?  No, they have promised not to do anything, and they're having another meeting on October  14th, and they are going to see, you know, if they can find an alternative.  But why can't they just do something else?  Well, I don't see why they can't just fix the platform. 
[01:20:00]  I mean, they can build nuclear bombs.  They can go to the moon.  And so, I mean, just to fix it, well, they claim there are wires underneath, which there  are, but they've been there for 37 years.  Oh, wow.  And I think that they, as long as they have the electric light company there, which they  should, which they probably will, you know, to check it.  Sure.  It'll be all right.  Now, you've gotten a lot of media attention on this, Ethel.  Yes, we did. 
[01:20:30]  We were very lucky.  And I believe that is helping your cause.  So is the tree now safe?  Yes.  Yes, until October 14th, at least.  Oh, goodness.  And probably even beyond that.  Can't you fix the slab or no?  Oh, I think it could be slipped.  But there's a kind of a slope there.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  And I imagine when the men come to pick up the dumpster thing that, you know, they're  not too careful, I don't imagine. 
[01:21:00]  I don't know.  But, you know, it has to, you know, the front of it's deteriorated over the years.  And one woman fell and broke her arm.  Oh, my goodness.  I hope she's okay.  Oh, yeah, she's fine.  Oh, good, good.  Can the tree be moved and saved?  No, the tree couldn't be moved, no.  No, I mean, I don't think it would even be worth it.  But it's a pretty spot.  That's what it is.  It's a very pretty spot.  Yeah, well, we saw it on TV and saw you ladies.  Do you spend a lot of time underneath the tree? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, well, we don't.  But we do have, like, a good view of it because otherwise we're just looking at a parking lot,  you know?  So that is a good place.  Yes.  Yeah.  Ethel, can you believe all the attention that you're getting?  No, I can't.  Only in America.  Only in America, right?  Yes.  Absolutely right.  I mean, can you imagine another scenario that would have given you guys this type of attention?  Oh, no, I can't imagine. 
[01:22:00]  It was amazing.  We saw the footage of you, the three of you kind of, like, tying yourselves up to the tree,  just kind of challenging them to move you.  Yeah.  That's right.  Very brave, Ethel.  Can you think, I'm sorry, Ethel, can you think of another example of something that you've  done like this?  No, not really, but we've been down several times when different things come up, you know,  to talk to the board.  Uh-huh.  But we didn't get too far with those things.  But, like, when we used to have umbrellas, well, there's two floors, and upstairs, they 
[01:22:30]  needed umbrellas, sun umbrellas, because in the summer, it's very hot.  But, of course it does, Ethel.  Yeah.  Of course it does.  Oh, they were very, very pretty, and I used to look down there, and I think, oh, that  is so pretty, it looks so nice, and maybe plants hanging from the railing, and we used  to have chairs on the porch and things.  Yeah.  Now we're allowed a chair on the porch, but we have to take it in each night.  Hmm.  Well, can you plant other trees there? 
[01:23:00]  No, no, well, they claim they could plant another apple tree where the dumpster was,  but if they can dig it to put an apple tree, they can dig it to fix it.  Right, right.  So that's the way I think, I don't know.  So they were saying that they can move the dumpster back where the old slab was?  Yes, it's still on the old slab, but all it needs to be done is, I don't know, I think  they could fix it.  Ethel, can you spell superfragilisticexpialidocious? 
[01:23:30]  What's that word?  Superfragilisticexpialidocious.  Superfragilisticexpialidocious.  Can you spell that?  Not right now, thank you.  Ethel, obviously, I'm hearing a bit of an accent.  Where are you from originally?  I was born in England, and during the end of the war, 1947, I came over and married my  husband.  Oh.  We were married for 54 years. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, God bless.  That's wonderful.  Now, Ethel, it's true.  It's a crabapple tree, right?  Yes.  Well, Cliff in New York wants to know, can you use the crabapples to make something delicious?  No.  I think a tree should be fed, or it probably needs attention to be able to use that.  Do you think you guys can give it the attention it needs?  Well, we can try.  We can try.  Either that, or just have the apples drop on our heads. 
[01:24:30]  Goodness gracious, Ethel.  But I gotta be honest, we were really shocked.  We love the kind of the way you three weren't backing down.  Yeah, sure.  Can you think of a way that you could have gotten more attention from this?  No, I don't.  I really don't.  This was the best attention we could have gotten.  Yeah.  It helps your cause, right?  All that focus, now all these people are interested.  It kind of helps you guys keep the tree going.  Yes, and we've had quite a few comments, you know, even on the computer and so forth.  Oh, I'm sure.  You use the computer? 
[01:25:00]  Yes.  Really?  Ethel, Brooklyn Ace wants to know if you could see the tree from your window.  Not from the window, from the porch, I can.  Oh, but not from the window.  Oh, okay.  Now, the other two can.  Oh, your friends, they can.  And you can too?  Yes.  Oh, they can and you can.  No, I can.  I can.  I saw it on the porch.  I can see it from here.  Right.  In fact, my son came down to look at it yesterday. 
[01:25:30]  He wanted to, because he couldn't really remember, you know, what it looked like.  And he said, it's a very pretty spot.  He said, it would be an eyesore to put a dumpster there.  Oh, it certainly would.  Hey, Steve from California wants to know, how old of a woman are you there, Ethel?  I know it's not polite.  It's not polite.  I know it.  Well, I am 85.  85?  God bless you, Ethel.  From now on, I'm changing my age.  I'm going down to 79.  Oh, goodness gracious. 
[01:26:00]  You are quite a card, Ethel.  Hey, Ethel, this is a 79-year-old battle axe.  Do you think you could climb the crabapple tree?  No, I don't think so.  No, I don't want to take that down.  No, absolutely not.  Can you smell, because I know that one of the concerns you had was that this nice area  you had to enjoy.  Can you smell the dumpster from where you are?  No, I can't, because I'm like four houses down, but the others would.  Good, because on that side, the wind seems to blow from that direction, and don't ask me 
[01:26:30]  which is north, south, east, or west, because I never can tell.  I can't either.  I just rely on someone.  Tell me.  So, you can tell direction good?  No, I can't tell direction good.  You tell me three times, and I'm fine.  Oh, I gotcha.  How often do you go back to England?  Well, when my husband was alive, we went quite a few times.  My two sons went, and they've been there, and now my grandsons have been there, and they 
[01:27:00]  love it.  And my granddaughter.  Oh, that's wonderful.  I'm sorry to hear about your loss after so many years.  I'm very sorry.  Yeah, that sucks.  Yeah, thank you.  That really sucks, man.  Yes, absolutely.  You sound like a wonderful woman.  Absolutely.  A lot of fun, a lot of energy.  That's nice that you and your friends have taken on this cause.  Right.  Any other causes in the future, perhaps?  Well, if they come up, we'll be ready.  Of course.  Josh in Boston Proper wants to know if you can at least reach up and 
[01:27:30]  and pick the crab apples.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, we could.  Oh, that's nice.  I could.  I'm not very tall, though, but I could.  I don't know.  What are crab apples good for?  I don't know.  I think, I don't know.  Maybe they make some kind of jelly, but I think they do put it in some kind of jelly.  Yeah?  Can you make a pie out of them?  Oh, I doubt it.  I mean, you personally.  No, not me.  I don't like cooking.  Oh, you don't, huh? 
[01:28:00]  No.  Can you bake?  Oh, yeah, I have bake, but I mean, as you get older, you're just cooking for yourself.  You don't try to go out and eat.  Can you run?  No, I can't run, I don't think.  I haven't tried.  I don't have to run for anything.  Yeah, what does she have to run for, Opie?  She can sit on the patio or under the tree?  I understand, but some of the older women out there, they're keeping themselves in shape  and stuff, though.  She sounds, I saw her.  Yeah, I think people, I think it's because of the TV. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, of course.  Yes, they know what it means to keep in shape, and they're much better off.  Ethel, can you rock climb?  Can I rock climb?  No, we did climb a mountain in a few years ago.  Can you bike?  I did a ski a few years ago.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  Can you bike?  Oh, I used to bike, yes.  That's all we had in England.  Can you water ski?  Water ski?  No, I do not like water.  Oh, you don't like the water.  No, I'm scared of the water. 
[01:29:00]  Well, that's probably why you moved off of the island over there, you know?  Oh, good gosh.  Can you rollerblade?  No, no.  Do you have vivid recollection of the war there, Ethel?  Oh, definitely.  Yeah, what was that like in England?  I like talking to people from England during the wartime.  What was that like for a young woman back there in the 40s during the war?  Well, it was very, well, we used to, like at night, we'd go to the, we called it the pictures, the movies. 
[01:29:30]  Right.  And then my mother and father were home, and my little niece was with them.  But as soon as the siren sounded, we ran, we ran all the way home, because we figured if one's going, we're all going.  And the air raids, we've had, we had bombs on the street.  Wow.  Yeah.  One night, well, we used to go down at a little shelter in the backyard.  It was like a little concert hut. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, my goodness.  And they dug down a big hole, and then they dropped it in.  But, of course, we were all there one night, because there was a big, big air raid going on.  Wow.  So, yeah, I remember all of it.  Wow, that is something.  That sure is.  So many stories, I bet.  I had five brothers and one sister in the service.  Really?  Yeah, my one brother died in Tunisia.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Oh, we're really sorry to hear that.  You know what?  Heroes.  You could be very proud.  Yes. 
[01:30:30]  Yes.  I think I could write a book.  You probably could.  Are you going to write one?  No, I don't think so, no.  I just took up painting with several of the ladies here, and I enjoy that.  Can you paint the Mona Lisa yet?  No, not yet, but just watch for the, just watch.  Are you able to speak German?  No, no, no.  No, but we did have Italian prisoners of war working on the land right near where I was. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, after we moved from London, we moved up to the East Coast, and there was all these,  but my mother used to make them cocoa and everything.  They were just ordinary people.  Oh, wow.  Just like everybody else.  So now I hear the Americans, you know, when they were over there.  Now, I'm not getting into any personal matters or anything, but any of the American men take  a fancy to you, Ethel?  Yeah, just this one.  Your husband? 
[01:31:30]  Yes.  Was he an American?  Yes, yes.  What did they used to say?  The worst thing about the Americans is they're overpaid?  Oh, that was the thing.  If they, you know, when they went to a, you know, to the pub or anything, I mean, they,  you know, and I think that's the way they are.  They're just generous, but they used to have their money out on the table, and of course,  the English didn't have such good uniforms either, you know, kind of scratchy uniforms.  But no, but no, my mother liked him. 
[01:32:00]  My mother really liked him.  It was something like they were overpaid, oversexed, and over here.  That was the problem.  Yeah.  Oh, goodness gracious, Ethel.  All right, let's say hi to Steve from...  Oh, no, let's not.  Steve, where are you calling from?  Hello.  I mean, you know...  Oh, hi.  Hi, Steve.  I think I have to leave early.  No, no.  This is terrible.  Ethel.  Hi, Ethel.  How are you?  This is Anthony, and I have to leave a little early. 
[01:32:30]  All right.  But it's been wonderful talking to you.  Thank you.  And now you can talk with Steve, because I want nothing to do with Steve.  Hi, Ethel.  How are you?  Okay.  I can't really hear.  There's a noise going on.  I don't know what it is.  I'm calling.  I'm one of the callers for the radio show.  How are you?  Wait, you can hear him okay, Ethel?  I can just about hear him, yes.  Oh.  Ethel, can you actually fix the slab yourself?  Can I what?  Can you fix the slab yourself? 
[01:33:00]  I think when I was younger, I might have done it.  Because I had a very similar thing.  We used to have a crab apple tree where I grew up.  Oh, did they?  Yes, I was constantly engaging in certain experiences behind it with other friends.  Yes.  Well, I don't know how long this one will last,  but for however long it lasts, I think it's still going to be there.  Well, do you think they're actually going to move the dumpster there?  Because that's where most of my production belongs.  Oh, you know what? 
[01:33:30]  Oh, no, I was wondering if they're going to move the dumpster there.  No, no, I don't want the dumpster there.  I'm sorry?  I don't want the dumpster there.  Yes, I love the fact that you took a stand because so many people won't take a stand.  They just allow everybody to walk on them.  That's right.  But when it happens, when it goes through, when it's all safe, then they're all right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I really admire the fact that you have so much energy, too,  because my grandmother always was like that, too. 
[01:34:00]  She had a tremendous amount of energy,  and she would always scold me for being in the closet with other boys and such.  And I love the fact that that energy keeps you going.  I'm right.  I'm good.  Do you have any other causes that you're going to be fighting for?  No, I don't.  If we say, come up, we'll be here as long as we can.  That's fantastic.  I can't do it.  Have you thought maybe you could name the crab apple tree?  Damn it, you've got to.  No.  No, that's silly.  No. 
[01:34:30]  Raboon.  No.  This lady's very nice.  Yes, Ethel is a wonderful, wonderful woman.  Ramone.  I enjoy eating crab apples.  They're delicious.  Oh.  Oh, well, I've never tried one.  Oh, Ramone.  I was only kidding.  You probably don't want to bake them into a pie, do you?  No, I don't think so, no.  No, no, no.  No.  Okay, well, I have to go now because even I have certain standards. 
[01:35:00]  Yes, I'm sure you do, Steve.  I don't have work ethics.  Yes.  And I don't have very good production.  I'm actually looking at the man I'm doing an impression of right now, so it's like, Ramone.  She's a wonderful woman.  God love her.  Yes.  Wow.  Well, thank you, Steve.  And Ethel.  Well, let's talk to Ethel a little.  Steve, all right.  There it goes.  There it goes.  Steve from Yellowstone.  Ethel, wow.  You're a media star.  Yeah, you sure are. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, I've got to tell my kids that.  Are you planning on doing any more television?  No, I don't think so.  No, I didn't like myself on television.  Oh, why not?  Why not, Ethel?  I thought you were charming.  Absolutely.  I think what it is, you don't really see yourself.  You know, I mean, you look in the mirror, but you don't really see yourself.  I don't know.  But I didn't like it.  Can you get out to Hollywood?  Oh, well, maybe someday.  Oh, maybe someday.  Hey, you can lead a horse to water, but... 
[01:36:00]  But you can't make it drink.  What was that?  Excuse me?  But you can't make it drink.  Exactly.  Right.  Wow.  I've got to get one more.  Hold on.  Uncle Paul up there in Worcester, Massachusetts, wants to say something to Ethel.  Oh, all right.  Hi, Ethel.  God love you.  Oh, thank you.  I love the energy.  Like the last caller said, I'm 57 years young. 
[01:36:30]  So how old are your grandchildren?  Oh, your grandchildren.  Yes.  Yes.  How old are your grandchildren?  Yes.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  How old are they?  What, is he a comedian?  No, no, no.  You have grandchildren.  How old are your grandchildren?  Oh.  How old?  Oh, my son.  Oh, I hate to say how old.  No, your grandchildren.  I think he's 58, 59.  I don't remember.  Yeah.  How old are your grandkids?  Oh, no, my grandchildren, they're one still in college. 
[01:37:00]  And one is a teacher, and the other one manages a store in Boston.  Ah, boy.  Yeah.  Oh.  Pretty awesome, yeah.  Oh, geez.  It looks like we've lost Uncle Paul.  Looks like we lost Uncle Paul somehow.  Maybe the phone line.  Yeah.  Wow.  He's talking now, Ethel.  Can you hear him?  No, I can't.  Thanks.  What's he ringing the bell for?  Trying to get the guy's attention to fix the phone line. 
[01:37:30]  That's right.  All right.  They said they fixed it.  Can you hear him now?  No.  No.  No.  Damn.  You'll do it for him, but not me.  I'll tell you, Ethel, you are a sharpie.  Thank you.  I like you.  You're very sharp-witted and just a wonderful woman.  And best of luck in any future endeavors that you may have in saving this tree.  I think it's a very noble cause of you and your friends.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  Keep fighting the good fight.  And maybe we'll talk to you after it's finally resolved. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks.  You sound like you have a good time.  Oh, we have a lot of fun here, Ethel.  We try.  Do you think you could do your own radio show?  No, I don't think so.  No.  No, I'm too busy.  Oh, really?  Wait, what do you do?  What do you do to keep busy?  Well, I do a lot of things.  We go out a lot.  We go out to eat.  Like I said, we go painting and we go looking in antique stores.  Can you drive, Ethel?  Oh, of course I can drive.  Very good. 
[01:38:30]  I'm going to be driving.  You don't get a flashback and drive on the wrong side of the road, do you?  Oh, no.  That did happen when we went back one time.  Oh, good gravy.  Yes, and then we came home, and then my husband came out, and he wasn't used to driving on  the other side.  Oh.  And all of a sudden, he realized he was on the wrong side.  It is.  When you're in the car, though, over there, and I used to look, and I see people looking  out of the window, and I'd say, well, he's not even looking where he's going, and I realized 
[01:39:00]  it was a passenger.  That's the passenger.  Oh, my God.  Can you drive from the left side over there?  No, I never drove over there.  No, all I had was a bicycle.  Oh, a bicycle.  Yeah.  Oh, that's quaint.  And take the trains and the buses, whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't hard.  Oh, boy.  We sure showed those Nazis, didn't we?  I guess we did.  Yes, we did.  He laughs.  I hear you, Ethel. 
[01:39:30]  I know where you're coming from.  That's right.  All right, sweetheart.  You have fun, and tell your friends hello for us.  I will.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Bye, Ethel.  Thank you, Ethel.  There she goes, Ethel.  What a sweet old bag.  She was very nice.  She was too nice.  And, boy, did we get a few C words out of her.  I did.  It was a good game.  She wasn't that easy.  No.  That's why it was fun to do.  She wasn't easy to stump.  Came up with a lot of different words for a cat all of a sudden. 
[01:40:00]  Damn it.  We needed her the most.  Holy meckle.  Good job, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  She's just too sweet an old lady.  I'm not Ramoning her.  From England.  Yeah, just Mary Poppins-ish.  Yeah.  It was funny, though.  Made it through the war.  Her husband forever is dead and everything.  The call came through.  You were trying to bail out.  Oh, I know.  She's like, I'm not even going to sit here. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, I was getting death threats on Pal Talk and stuff.  Be nice, Tar.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Ethel's all right in our book.  Yeah.  We'll take a break.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm starting to look like I got punched in the face.  Hey, what happened?  I'm going home.  What happened? 
[01:41:00]  F you, if you don't understand.  That is really...  I will...  I'll make it to 9 o'clock, but...  I hope he's swelling up.  I came in a little itchy.  Yeah.  And now it looks like I went a few rounds with Chuck Liddell or somebody because my whole  eye is swelling up.  The last time this happened to me, I was in the emergency room in really bad shape.  Is it something you ate?  Yeah, because it's getting worse and worse as the morning goes on.  I came in here like slightly itchy on my head.  No, don't take pictures. 
[01:41:30]  I'm not an animal.  How about for Opie's eye?  No, I'm not an animal.  No.  Yeah.  I'll take a picture of Opie's eye for Opie's eye today because it looks like it got punched  in the face really hard.  Oh, that was it.  I was trying to remember the goddamn bit that was being played when I was driving home the  other day.  What?  And it was Jimmy goofing on the elephant man.  Dude, I wanted to call you. 
[01:42:00]  It was some of the funniest crap I ever heard.  I don't even remember.  Oh, it was hysterical.  You're just talking about, my kit.  My kit.  You're talking about his wispy little hair.  Call me.  You bashed the elephant man.  Worse than anybody in real life probably laughing at him.  Talking about the hooker.  How they're pushing her face toward him.  It was so goddamn funny.  Brilliant stuff.  I just picked the tough targets.  Always.  Elephant man.  And how he dabbed the cologne behind his ears and threw his head back. 
[01:42:30]  That was my favorite.  His man about town moment.  And you know, he still smelled like rotting flesh.  Of course he did.  Giant scab.  Dead at 21.  Trying to sleep like a person.  It's beautiful.  My brother.  There's a picture of her at my socket.  She was average at best.  You're just a minus six.  Your mom was a three, dude.  My kit.  That was the greatest.  Poor, poor Anthony Hopkins trying to give him some dignity. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Comb your hair with this.  It's a rake.  Should have been a shotgun.  Here, comb your hair with this.  It's a hangman's noose.  A huge one.  Over that head.  Yeah, look.  Are you going to lasso a wild animal?  No, what's the hangman's noose?  And then you're talking about the kid, the picture of the kid sleeping that he had, laying  down.  And it's like, good.  You can't do that, dummy.  You were so mean.  I vaguely remember talking about him. 
[01:43:30]  And I remember my favorite part was that he would try to be incognito with a burlap hat  with an eye hole.  With an eye hole.  This would be less conspicuous.  Like, carry a stick with fire on it so people look at the fire.  They don't notice your head.  He was a boob.  He certainly was.  Big show off.  I never saw that movie.  I know.  I know.  It is a great movie.  I know.  It's so good.  Keith in Jersey.  Keith.  Great comedy.  Hey, Keith.  Yeah, how are you? 
[01:44:00]  Good evening.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, listen.  If you're having food allergies, just a word of caution, dude.  You should be taking a couple of Benadryls to hold you over to stop the swelling.  Yeah, it's swelling pretty good right now.  My left eye is...  And then my right eyelid, I'm feeling, is like swelling up.  Nice.  That's really...  That's a real swell over the left eye.  Let's see if you got hit.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  And someone's saying, A-Op, if you went a few rounds with Chuck Liddell, you'd be  standing with your fists in the air, smiling, so...  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:44:30]  That's a nice Liddell bash.  Yeah.  What happened?  I hope he won the fight.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you couldn't beat Liddell, though.  I don't think so.  Literal Jim.  You can't make fun of our pal Liddell.  He had a bad night.  He kept that arm down too much.  Yeah.  He's got to stop with that arm down.  Yeah.  Bob Kelly pointed out, too, that Liddell was coming with an uppercut.  Yeah.  And he said it was just like Evans hit him as his uppercut was coming.  Yeah, but as he was doing that, his left arm was completely down-exposing his head.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  And supposedly, he does that a lot.  Mm-hmm.  That's what Rampage knocked him out when he did that, I think.  Well, yeah.  He dropped that left arm.  Man, did he nail him in the jaw.  Oh, was that an ugly one?  Why would you do that for a living?  Why would you go to a place where people want...  Like, the whole other...  Like, when I watched Two Fighters, my first thought was, well, I'm really glad neither  one of them was punching me in the face.  Yeah.  Why would you want to be the focus?  Like, all this guy's thinking of is knocking me unconscious.  Yeah.  Like, that's his job.  Punching me in the face hard enough where I lose consciousness.  That's the goal.  How do I get the attention off of me? 
[01:45:30]  I can focus on something else.  Yeah, it's only you and him in the ring like that, so you're pretty much getting punched  at some point.  I would make a terrible boxer.  I'd get hit once and start crying.  Like, the old days.  Hey, can we talk about Sarah Palin's email getting hacked?  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, who the hell is a brave little hacker?  Yeah.  Yeah, that doesn't seem too smart, right?  No.  Somebody is going to be audited for the next 20 years. 
[01:46:00]  Yep.  Hacked her email.  And then there's some kind of allegations being made that she's using this personal email  for business, which is kind of against the rules.  You're supposed to have all your emails be accountable when you're in her position.  Right.  Well, here's the story.  Apparently, there has been an extraordinary invasion of privacy against Sarah Palin.  A hacker has broken into her personal email account, posted her private emails on the  web, which is against the law. 
[01:46:30]  Now, from what I understand, and we're just getting the information in now, nothing harmful  to the governor has been posted on the net so far, correct?  Right.  What we've seen is just basically personal emails where she talked to other staff members  and a friend about what was going on in the media, but nothing that appears to be politically  damaging at this point.  What?  What?  You're reading further, Jimmy? 
[01:47:00]  Who cares about her email?  I got something really unpleasant.  What happened?  A fart?  No.  Fish found in...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I just read the headline and couldn't read the story.  It's got to be a small fish.  What's the big deal?  Two centimeters long.  How big is centimeters and inches?  It's almost an inch.  A two centimeter long fish.  It's almost an inch?  I thought two centimeters was over an inch.  It has to be over an inch.  It was a little over an inch.  I have a converter on my iPhone, so...  Isn't that a .62, .62 type of situation? 
[01:47:30]  Metrics suck.  Why do we do metrics?  Wouldn't it be a 1.24?  Metric.  No.  Look at it.  Hold on.  Dr. Steve Opie texted.  Isn't everything 62?  2.54 centimeters is one inch.  Oh, that's right.  Huh?  No, it's less than...  It's a little more than an inch.  Hold on.  We got medical advice here.  2.5 centimeters is an inch, so...  It's under an inch.  Isn't that what you said?  2.54 centimeters equals one inch?  Yes.  Oh, you did say that.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[01:48:00]  Okay.  Dr. Steve says you need...  He said get someone 50 milligrams of Benadryl.  He needs an EP pen.  No, I'm not doing that crap.  Epi?  The owl just gave me one of those a while ago.  I'm not doing that.  An EP pen that you just stab in your leg?  I'm not doing that.  Yeah, you have to stab yourself.  Yeah.  Like a lunatic.  Like a lunatic.  You do, though.  I got to stab you three times?  Because it's not a little, like, you know, like a little, like, you know, you have to...  Into your thigh. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  I'm not doing that.  Did it with a stapler.  Let's go to Ned.  Ned, what's going on?  Ned?  Good morning, needy tits.  Can't stand on the radio, sir.  All right.  That didn't make it.  Oh, boy.  No, that didn't make it.  So, try again.  Ned doesn't know the rules.  What's up, Ned?  Good morning.  Yeah, I'm a medic in New York.  You ought to take 50 milligrams of Benadryl.  You don't need Epi right now because your airway's not involved.  But if your eye is swelling shut, it could start to affect your breathing. 
[01:49:00]  So, you want to take 50 milligrams of Benadryl.  It may make you a little sleepy, but I would do that.  Yeah.  Last time this happened was, like, the day after a Super Bowl.  And I was in Huntington, and I got up in the middle of the night with...  No, many years ago.  I haven't had this in, like, three, maybe four years.  And I had a horrendous headache.  Got up in the middle of the night.  I was going to just take aspirin and go back to bed.  And I learned later on at the emergency room that if I would have taken the aspirin, I could have possibly killed myself. 
[01:49:30]  Nice.  That's the worst thing to do when you are in...  Really?  ...in an allergy attack mode.  And I finally called my brother, Elmo.  Brother Elmo comes to the house, and he opens the door, like, three in the morning.  And I couldn't even see out of my eyes.  And he went, holy ass.  You're a mess.  But they got some good crap, because they put an IV in, and they put something in that IV.  And my brother actually watched my face shrink back to normal in front of his eyes.  Like that.  People are suggesting I give you a trach with a Bic pen.  I'll be all right. 
[01:50:00]  I came in a little itchy, but now it's like, it's just bad.  Yeah.  Two centimeters.  I want to itch so bad.  Yeah.  Can I itch?  It'll make it a lot bigger, I'm telling you.  Don't itch it.  Itch around it.  That's what I always try to...  If I have an itch, like, say it's above my...  I'll take my thumb and pointer finger and dig them in around it, not on the area, and just  try to, like...  Not painfully, but just to try to...  They don't even know what an itch is.  They don't know if it's... 
[01:50:30]  What?  Well, it's funny.  You should say...  I say it's dry skin.  It's like my new Saturday night show.  It's called Jim's Itch Analogies.  I have a bunch of itch stories I tell.  Some are funny, some are sad, make you laugh, make you cry, it'll make you itch.  They don't know if, like, when you scratch it, what that does.  If it's just an alternate sensation, which stops the sensation.  They don't know exactly what it is.  I'll do it for you.  Two centimeters is .787.  Oh, back to the fish in the...  This is a good one.  In the Benadryl Norton. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Might make you drowsy.  Who gives a crap?  I might die live on the show.  Let's get back to the...  The boy with the fish.  Yeah, that's way more important.  This patient was admitted to a hospital.  He was in India.  With pain, he had, like, dribbling urine and an acute urinary retention spanning a 24-hour period.  According to the boy, the fish slipped into his penis while he was cleaning his aquarium at home.  What?  Shut up.  The kid's into some kink.  He was trying something.  How?  I probably wasn't even sexual.  It's probably just to see what would happen.  This is hurting, just talking about something like this. 
[01:51:30]  And this professor, a long name, who treated the boy, he wrote a paper.  He said, this is what the boy said.  Talk about flimsy excuses.  While he was cleaning the fish tank in his house, he was holding a fish in his hand and  he had to go to the toilet.  While he was using the toilet, standing, I'm assuming, the fish slipped from his hand and  entered his urethra.  And then he developed all these symptoms.  So he's saying that he just happened to be going to the bathroom holding the fish.  Holding a fish.  You go to the bathroom. 
[01:52:00]  And you drop it.  No, he's holding it.  Yeah.  And the fish just slipped from his hand up into his urethra.  No.  That's impossible.  Of course.  That's impossible.  That's crazy.  After detecting the fish in the boy's bladder, the doctors used a technique known as a sister...  Oh, boy.  A sister?  Sister with oscarpies.  To insert a special set of forceps down the patient's penis.  Unfortunately, the fish was just too slippery to grip.  So they resorted to using a rigid ureteroscope with a tool attached that is normally used for 
[01:52:30]  removing bladder stones.  Oh, my God.  Why not just cast a line in there?  That...  A lot of people call him Bravo Sierra on that one.  On what?  My eye?  No, no.  On the fish.  Really?  The boys in the back are reviewing a tape of something called the penis fish, which you're  looking at on your screen right now.  And it apparently... 
[01:53:00]  There is a fish that swims...  Girl with that nickname in my high school.  Yes.  You always knew the best girl they had fish in their stomach.  All aquarium belly should be color.  Hey, Kenny's got something he wants to say.  Oh, boy.  You always know what Kenny is.  And he was all excited.  I can't read his psychotic handwriting.  So, Kenny, what did you want to say?  No, Anthony, it probably is Bravo Sierra because those type of fish can't swim upstream.  Let's go to Dr. Steve in Tennessee. 
[01:53:30]  Dr. Steve, how are you, sir?  Hey, Matt.  Hey.  Hey, it's Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve.  You know that jackass EMT that I never said you needed Epi now, but I do think that it  would help if you had one just in case one time when this happened, you stopped breathing.  I've never stopped breathing.  I've had allergy attacks my entire life, and it never got to the point I stopped breathing.  What's an Epi?  I've been getting, like, these hives off and on ever since I was, like, a little kid. 
[01:54:00]  I haven't had this, though, in, like, four years, and it's happening today.  Well, that's the problem with food allergies is they just can be unpredictable.  So, you know, I'm just thinking if you just have one just in case, it might save your radio.  I'm not carrying an EpiPen around.  Okay.  At least go take the Benadryl, and what they probably gave you in the emergency room was  the shot of steroids.  I think they did, yeah. 
[01:54:30]  I hope he's on the roids.  You know what?  I had the worst headache ever, and, man, they got good stuff in the hospital because whatever  they put in the IV, I felt the headache go, like, whew.  Why don't they just make that available to everybody?  Yeah, instead of, like, the very low dose of aspirin we take where it takes its time,  whatever they put in that IV, maybe Dr. Steve could tell me, this thing, this headache went  away in seconds.  It was amazing.  Screw aspirin.  How about morphine?  Why can't they put morphine over the counter?  Doctor, comment? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Well, you know, in Santa Fe, my codeine over the counter.  And you know what?  Canadians are all crazy drug fiends anyway.  Doped out elk lovers.  And, Dr. Steve, I didn't, like, I didn't put you on the air for me.  I could, you know, I'll be fine.  I want to know more about this penis fission and some of these instruments they used to  get it out.  Well, you know, one of the urethroscopes that they use is named after one of my great-uncles.  So, and he also invented an incontinence clamp. 
[01:55:30]  And what it is, is basically it's a clothespin that you clamp over the end of your male membership  and it keeps you from, uh, voiding in your house.  Oh, that doesn't sound very scientific.  Wow.  That one's named after, that one's got our family name, too.  Oh.  How the hell are you supposed to pick up girls with that, uh, apparatus?  His uncle's name was Bill Ouch. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  But, yeah, the penis fish is a real thing.  Wow, that is, uh, no, no, uh, no BS there, huh?  So, what do you think happened?  He was just being weird?  Like, like, kids will do weird things.  Like, you eat weird things.  You put something up, you know, he's probably, he wanted to see if it would swim up his penis?  Well, I, yeah, the thing about fish is that they've got, I mean, if you, uh, take their  fins, you can rub them one way and they flatten down against their, their tails.  But if you try to do it the other way, the barbs come out and, uh, these penis fishes 
[01:56:30]  will swim up and they can get up one way, but they can't get back out again.  Oh.  And, uh, apparently it's unbelievably painful because as, if, if you, as the pressure from  the urine from the bladder tries to push the thing out, it's those barbs catch in the,  in the, uh, tube called the urethra and that's just unbelievable.  Wow.  It could have been worse.  It could have been a shark or a piranha.  What do you do if a shark's growing? 
[01:57:00]  It happens.  A big nurse shark swimming around your bladder?  It's possible.  It's possible.  It could happen.  Wow.  I'm not going to cut that boy open and see that shark spill out all over the dock.  So what would eventually happen with, like, can't you, why can't you tinkle with this  thing in your bladder?  Is it blocking the bladder hole?  Well, I think a lot of times the, uh, fish doesn't get all the way up to the bladder.  You know, that, the, the tube is very small.  Yeah, I would guess you would suffer.  It's stretchable.  It's stretchable to a certain degree.  But I think most of the time these things get lodged in the urethra and that's what really 
[01:57:30]  comes.  Oh, my God.  Did the fish die, do you think, while he's there?  Oh, the fish die?  Well, yeah.  No, it's, it's, it's, it's not real breathable environment for him.  No.  Hey.  Then you got a rotting dead fish in your urethra.  I almost be fun.  Uh, I, I want to continue with something I said earlier, you know, uh, sheltered life,  horrible curfew, not allowed to, to kind of like, uh, not so bad, is it?  Hang with the street kids, uh, so I'm going to sound a bit naive, but are, are, are guys 
[01:58:00]  like, uh, doing stuff with their, you know what, uh, holes?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Um, what's that about?  Why?  Well, you see paper clips in the, uh, in the bladder all the time, and then it's always,  it was an accident.  Yeah.  I was doing some filing.  I was filing some records and, um, the paper clip snapped off.  I was nude.  I do believe I'm talking to the majority of men listening to the show right now, and 
[01:58:30]  we've all had a bit of a sting because we might've used a product in the shower to do  a something, to do a little paper type.  Oh, oh, oh, right, right, right, right.  Yeah, that'll burn.  And, uh, just, yeah, shampoo.  The shampoo burn, and, uh, just knowing that, uh, most of us have felt that experience, why  the F would you experiment with that, that part of your body with anything?  Yeah.  Because it seems like the slightest little nick will cause horrendous burning pain. 
[01:59:00]  Wow.  People manipulate their urethras all the time.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Jimmy, you've done a lot of things in your life.  Never anything like that.  I do know one dominatrix I talked to, let's just say that she dated a guy who was a doctor  or a surgeon, he was one of her clients, and he enjoyed something with the urethra and  a scalpel.  And she said that it would be, it was basically, he liked the feeling of the scalpel being pulled  out of his urethra, but not, just enough to nick it, where he would feel the pain the 
[01:59:30]  next couple of days.  God!  Stop this!  But not, and I knew her very well, she was telling me the truth, she said it wasn't like  a, anything that would probably go too far into the body, just a little bit, but enough  to cut.  Oof.  Yeah, I just, I don't, I don't comprehend that desire.  I'm getting report that our own Pat Duffy tried to, well, let's just say, use a crayon  differently.  Oh my.  Did you, Pat?  Why?  What color? 
[02:00:00]  Red.  Red?  Yeah.  At least when you're finished.  Now we all understand, like, what, you know, what you were doing.  Everyone knows what's going on, so.  Because that's where we'll get dumped out.  We don't need any details.  Why?  I was a really little kid, I just wanted to see if it could fit.  Why?  I don't know.  That's the dumbest thing.  Did it?  It did, yes.  Was your sharpener broken?  Like when the crayon sharpened it would break.  Why, though?  I don't know.  And what did it feel like, do you remember?  It hurt.  It was like, it was a really like, internal burn, if that makes any sense. 
[02:00:30]  The Cigars and Scotch is saying, what kind of, was it, did you use Gaiola crayons?  Gaiola.  Wow.  Oh, no, it's that new red, burnt member.  Anything else to add to that, Pat?  No.  All right.  Dr. Steve, we've got to take a break.  I mean, we can continue with you after the break if you want.  I got the hospital calling me, boys.  I got to go.  All right.  Well, you want to maybe plug something, Dr. Steve?  Do you have any shows coming up? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, right on 10, 12, 3.  Very nice.  Hey, Steve.  Steve, how about a little email, what I should do with this, two big hives around my left eye  and itchy ears that might turn into something.  Okay, I'll shoot it off to you as soon as I get to my office.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Okay, man.  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  We'll finish up next.  A lot of weird stuff going on today.  Some stuff we're talking about, some stuff we're not. 
[02:01:30]  Opie and Anthony, good morning.  If you're keeping track at home, my eye will be completely shut within the hour.  Thank you.  Oh, really?  And I know a lot of people hoping for the worst, and I appreciate that.  877-212-ONA.  Dicks.  What happened to you two weeks ago?  When are you bringing my stuff over? 
[02:02:00]  What's going on, Ant?  I don't know.  I'm being...  You got a text message coming in?  I'm texting.  But you get text messages all morning long.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a little prisoner exchange that's got to take place.  You haven't done the exchange yet?  No.  What are you waiting for?  Every time we leave, I just kind of hit the 59th Street Bridge, and I'm like, ah, I'm going home. 
[02:02:30]  So I guess I could take care of that.  Are you taking care of that today?  Yeah.  Oof.  I'm not looking forward to that.  Oh, gosh.  Are you ready to talk yet?  You kind of hinted that you might talk eventually.  I don't know.  I can't really get into any details.  No, I know you wouldn't do that.  Wink, wink.  But let's just say there are a couple of items that have to be returned in order for me to get some items. 
[02:03:00]  Wow, that really.  Yeah.  That kicked in perfectly.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, uh...  I would just say screw the items.  No, there's a couple...  See, it wasn't just a couple of things that I might have left over there.  Uh-huh.  See, there were certain things that made their way over there without me taking them there. 
[02:03:30]  Were they supposed to make their way over there?  I don't think so.  No.  No, they weren't.  I believe if there were people, you'd call them hostages.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's safe to say some of the things are being held hostage.  Well, that's a...  For what reason, though?  That's a, um... 
[02:04:00]  Just to turn the screw a little bit.  Well, I don't know.  There's a couple of items that I do need to get back.  That...  And there's a few items...  That should have never left your house.  Good.  Okay.  Good.  I don't know what role I'm supposed to play here.  And then, well, you're doing fine.  You kind of, like, threw this out to here, so we're going to explore this a little bit.  Well, because I just got a text.  All right.  We've gotten a text in quite some time.  Okay.  But I just got one, and... 
[02:04:30]  If this person is listening, I've been with Anthony for 14 years.  Not as gay lovers, as radio show hosts.  Gay lovers have only been up the past three.  About it, yeah.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, you three?  About three.  I thought four.  Yes.  Wonderful.  Let's go to California and get married.  I'm just trying to help your case here.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You are a procrastinator.  Just want to throw that out there.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I am.  So, you know, this is normal behavior for Anthony that... 
[02:05:00]  Don't do today what you can put off till you bury your head in the sand and try to make  believe it never happened.  That's what I say.  Okay.  I've seen that over and over again.  Yes.  Over and over.  And you know you do have to deal with this someday.  Yeah, I know.  I know, but...  No, I'm just talking about, in general, my experience with you for the last 14 years.  But not today! 
[02:05:30]  Right.  That's all.  It's like, we got to deal with it at some point, but I always say not today.  And then tomorrow rolls around, and you know what tomorrow turns into after 24 hours?  Today!  Yeah.  So that's why I don't kind of get involved.  Mm-hmm.  But apparently, there are a couple of items that I need to get back.  That were never supposed to leave your house.  Yeah.  Okay.  And in order to get those back, I have to give some items that aren't at my house. 
[02:06:00]  What?  Yeah.  I have to pick up a few things.  You have to pick up a few things for someone you don't hang with anymore.  Well, no, but that's what it is.  I gotta get...  To get stuff that was never supposed to leave your house back.  Yeah.  Correct?  Yeah.  I gotta get some dry cleaning.  And a camera.  What?  What?  So the camera got lost at the party. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, the party.  And...  Why did the camera get lost?  I don't know.  Some dumb English guy decided to push people in a pool.  All right.  So a camera was destroyed.  And the camera was kind of...  Well, it came out of the pool, and then it just disappeared.  Okay.  So now I have to get another camera...  Okay.  ...and pick up a bunch of dry cleaning.  Dry cleaning.  And then I'll get...  How does that make sense?  ...other stuff back.  I'm asking too many questions.  That's fine, but I gotta ask...  There's nothing about...  How does that make sense?  There's nothing about making sense here. 
[02:07:00]  There's nothing about making sense here.  This is just the way it is.  So you get a camera and pick up some dry cleaning.  You get your stuff back.  And then I'll get some stuff back.  That was never supposed to be taken from your house.  When are you writing the book?  Well, you know, we...  It's kind of an odd situation because, you know, it was...  I guess in trade, if you look at the big picture, I guess I'm, you know...  I owe somebody. 
[02:07:30]  How do you owe?  For my poor behavior.  Oh, my God.  So...  So...  What I need to do is pick up some dry cleaning.  So because of your bad behavior...  Right.  Let's go with this a little bit.  My poor behavior...  Your very poor behavior?  Has made it...  How bad was the behavior?  Ah, pretty poor.  My behavior was pretty poor.  Did you say abysmal?  Abysmal.  But... 
[02:08:00]  Yes?  Impressive.  Well, uh...  A hell of a chapter for a book.  A chapter?  A hell of a book.  Well, that chapter alone would be fine.  But, um...  Yeah.  So...  So you had some horrible behavior.  Yes.  Some abominable behavior on my part.  That a person decides to take stuff from your house.  Yes.  To hold hostage.  Take a few things and leave a few things.  Leave a few things?  Yeah.  Some things were left... 
[02:08:30]  In...  Your house?  My...  No.  In my new fire pit.  In the backyard.  There were a few things that were left there.  But, Anthony, that doesn't make sense because when all this went down, it was at least 100  degrees outside.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was no reason to have a fire.  The things took up a lot less room after that.  I'll tell you that.  Yeah. 
[02:09:00]  So...  So there was a fire.  Mm-hmm.  In your new fire pit.  Yeah.  When I got home, apparently, um...  Okay.  When I got home, um, one day, uh, about a month or so ago, I guess, there was, um, there's  a fire in my fire pit.  Which is odd because it was August.  And then there were little bits of, of, um, like a zipper and, and, um, rivets. 
[02:09:30]  Mm-hmm.  And, um, um, a lot of underwires.  Not underwear.  Underwire.  As if brassieres had been burnt.  But.  Exactly.  But.  All my bras that I like wearing around the house.  But that's not firewood.  No, it's not. 
[02:10:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  So someone was left without some clothing.  Travis.  Yes.  Oh, no.  You already established that.  He rocked.  You had less clothing for yourself.  No, no, no.  What?  None of my clothes.  Oh.  Yeah.  I didn't understand.  See, it was, it was tied into my abominable behavior.  I got it.  I'm just playing.  See, the dumb part, you idiot.  See, if you're behaving poorly. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Uh, as abominable as my behavior was, there's usually an accomplice.  I got it.  So the accomplice took the brunt of my abominable behavior.  Mm-hmm.  Um, at the cost of, uh, clothing.  Wow.  Looks like I'm not the only one that has hives right now.  I see other people itching on Pal Talk.  A few other people are itching, Anthony.  So it was, um...  Um...  But your behavior, some people will find impressive. 
[02:11:00]  I just want to say that.  Well...  When they find out, maybe someday in a book, years and years from now.  Well, yeah, yeah.  The details are, are really, um, quite stunning.  Quite stunning.  So that leads to you now doing a prisoner exchange.  Yeah.  By, you have to, uh, pick up some dry cleaning and buy a new camera.  I could use...  And then, are you, uh, who's doing the prison exchange?  Not you personally.  I might have to sublet that, uh, out.  Absolutely.  I might have to, um, delegate that responsibility to, um... 
[02:11:30]  Kenny.  Maybe Keith.  Or Keith.  Yeah.  Keith might be working.  Kenny could do it right now for you.  I'd never been in a position where I couldn't come up with an instant excuse.  I'm very good at instant excuses.  Lying, you mean?  I call them instant excuses, Jimmy.  Well, um...  Knowing what I know, what excuse could you have possibly used?  Yes, it was very hard to come up with an excuse. 
[02:12:00]  Did you try?  Picture...  Remember the old game show with Monty Hall, Let's Make a Deal?  Remember that show?  There's door number one, door number two, and door number three.  And behind one is a zonk.  You never wanted the zonk, uh, door to open.  That'd be some awful, like...  It would be something horrible.  Yeah.  Like, uh...  Baking soda.  Yeah, yeah.  A dumb thing of baking soda.  Or something.  Um, yeah.  And, uh, there was a situation... 
[02:12:30]  Well, what was behind the other door?  ...in my house that, uh...  Well, you open up one door, and it was fine.  House has a lot of doors.  That was the...  The...  The...  The Chevy Chevette was behind that door.  All right.  And that door opened at one point.  Nice.  And I was like, whew!  The Chevy Chevette.  No zonk.  But then that door closed, and there was a little more dialogue.  And then another door opened.  Oh, and that was a bad door to open. 
[02:13:00]  This will all make sense at some point.  No.  Some people may have considered it a prize.  Yes.  No, no.  It was a prize.  But it wasn't good for the moment.  Yeah.  Trust me.  They're good at reading between the lines.  Our listeners know what the hell.  I was sitting there on the edge of my bed, looking at a closet door, going, please just 
[02:13:30]  don't open that one.  I have a lot of closets in my house.  That's the one that you shouldn't open.  When did this go down?  A month ago.  And, um, was it opened?  Oh, it got opened.  But why...  That was a fine, how do you do?  Was...  Hmm.  But...  See, it went from a two-way conversation...  Two-way...  Instantly to a three-way conversation.  I understand that.  But...  I like that.  Why would you play... 
[02:14:00]  Hmm.  Hmm.  I would have to say you thought it was safe to play, uh...  The closet game.  I thought it was completely...  No, it was the only choice at that point.  So...  I had to play the closet game.  So you knew it was a risky game that you were venturing into at that moment?  Or did you feel like you...  I didn't want the scenario of, let's say, the door opening and just, there it is! 
[02:14:30]  You know?  Like, the door to the room I was in.  Mm-hmm.  I didn't want that opening and just, like, the stereotypical, there it is scenario.  Mm-hmm.  So I figured maybe hiding, um, something would have, would have remedied the problem.  Or at least given me a little time to think.  To think on my feet.  Don't you have a patio?  Um, yes!  In hindsight, the patio might have been a better choice. 
[02:15:00]  But, the neighbors may have been alarmed.  Well...  At the patio.  Ah, gotcha.  See, uh, because the closet is a better place for somebody to perhaps, uh, become more presentable  than they were beforehand.  See, the balcony, probably not a good idea.  But did, did you know the person, the, the other person was gonna, like, start opening doors?  Like, no, I didn't think the other person was actually gonna come in the house. 
[02:15:30]  So she wasn't in that.  Okay.  It was a little surprise.  Oh, yeah!  Surprise for a lot of people.  Yeah, that was a surprise.  Can I say, where was the other person in the house when you realized the other person,  like, where, how close to the, to the bad door was the other person?  Like, were they in the driveway, or were they walking up the steps?  Open that door!  From the front door?  No.  From outside the bedroom door. 
[02:16:00]  It was locked?  That was the first indication.  So I, it was like, hmm.  I looked around, I went, there aren't many options here.  Patio.  Was it, what time of the day was it?  It was morning.  So it was light out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Patio.  So why...  Patio wouldn't have worked.  Shirt, patio, duck.  Why'd you open the door?  Hmm.  Because he's stupid. 
[02:16:30]  Why wouldn't you like?  I, I had to open the door because not opening the door would have been, um, an admission  of guilt.  Yeah, but see, you don't like dealing with things, so I'm amazed you actually opened the  door.  Knowing you, I would imagine you would make some kind of homemade ladder and get the hell  out of your bedroom.  Well, yeah, in hindsight, I should have had one of those, uh...  And knowing you, then you would run, run, run, and just leave the house to whoever wants  it and start over somewhere. 
[02:17:00]  That's how ant works.  Can I, can I say...  A lot of ant rules are coming in, by the way.  I didn't say that.  Yes, Jimmy?  When that, uh, let's say, when the magic, uh, let's make a deal door got opened...  Yeah.  Uh, can I, what was the reaction?  Well, let's just say, what was, uh...  The first reaction was, someone pulled out a camera and snapped a picture.  What?  Yes.  What?  A picture was taken.  What?  Cool.  Yes.  This is new info.  Oh, yeah.  But, uh, but I thought the camera... 
[02:17:30]  No, it was from the camera phone.  Ah.  Camera phone picture.  It was like, hi.  And then, a single, blunt question was asked, and answered just as bluntly and very accurately.  Were you?  Wow.  Yeah.  It was answered...  Well, wasn't it obvious?  Not by me.  I was still in the, it wasn't me phase of the...  Hey, what are you doing here?  But, um... 
[02:18:00]  Hey, honey, look.  What is this?  Yeah.  It's not my birthday.  Yeah.  Let me ask you a question.  Would it be the equivalent of...  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  If you walked into your house and saw a burglar and said, what are you doing here?  And the burglar said, robbing your house.  I'm robbing your house.  Exactly.  That's exactly what it was.  Hey, uh, so...  Not even, what are you doing here?  It's like, so, you're robbing the house, right?  Yes, I'm robbing the house. 
[02:18:30]  Well, how long have you been robbing the house?  About three weeks.  So, the burglar...  I gotta say, the burglar's fairly stupid, because the burglar could have just said, it's my first  time robbing the house.  I don't think it mattered at that point if the house had been robbed once, twice, or probably  a hundred times.  It does matter, because this way, the homeowner doesn't feel like a complete idiot for not  recognizing that their house had been burglarized many times before.  Many times before.  It's much easier for a homeowner to walk in, see a burglar, and go, all right, it happens, 
[02:19:00]  you get burglarized, as opposed to, oh my god, I should have known that the salt shaker  wasn't where I left it.  See, then there's a lot of anger towards the burglar...  Exactly.  ...because you feel like a fool.  Look, I'm not denying that.  So, are you mad at Keith?  Why would I be mad at Keith?  For not hiding better.  Yes. 
[02:19:30]  Ant is an idiot.  Why I...  Wow, you're taking on legendary status here.  One of my favorite scenarios, though, was during a discussion that was taking place.  Uh-huh.  At the time, of which I was not involved in, but was in close quarters, too.  Where my only contribution was to slowly slip my hand onto my night table, and all you heard 
[02:20:00]  was the click-click of a magazine coming out of my pistol, and the pistol going away, and  me saying, maybe I should just tuck this away.  Really?  I don't think it ever would have come to that.  No, no.  I don't like having that around.  But you're responsible.  I'm very responsible in that fashion.  Yes.  In other ways, I'm probably not too responsible.  You've said that many times, yes.  You know.  So, that leads us to today, where there's going to be a prison exchange. 
[02:20:30]  There's a ransom thing happening here.  Yes, yes.  You get a few items back that you really want that were never supposed to be taken from  your house.  Right.  And, but you have to buy a camera and pick up dry cleaning.  Yeah.  See, because when the discussion was over, and somebody left the house, they left in my  Escalade.  And, oh.  Oh.  What?  Yeah.  The, the, the, the, what? 
[02:21:00]  Yes.  Not the one in the...  I just watched my Escalade drive away and went, hmm.  Not the one in the...  Wait.  The one in the closet?  No, no, no.  The burglar was still in the house.  And after all that...  Oh, my God.  Did the burglarizing continue?  No.  I was ransacked.  Wow.  Did you at least shoot the burglar in the face?  Wait a minute. 
[02:21:30]  What?  But...  Yeah.  Didn't this person have their own ride?  Yeah.  But not at your house?  No, it was there.  And there it stayed for a day or two.  And then when I got my, um, my Escalade back, there was a, uh, a little mixed CD and the  CD player that had some choice songs on it.  Songs?  Yeah.  And, uh, let's see, my... 
[02:22:00]  Do you still have that?  Wait.  Uh, I, I, I have to go through the cash lanes now of the, um, tolls.  You don't have the easy.  Uh, yeah, that...  Hey, uh, what were the songs?  Um.  And there was more than one?  Well, you, you know, one of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the one.  Okay.  Yeah.  Play a little of that.  Any Carrie Underwood?  I, what, wow.  What's that?  I didn't even look...  Of course it is.  No, is this it?  Carrie Underwood.  Yeah.  Gotta wait for the hook.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  Right now...  No, this wasn't it.  Wow, this would've been a good one.  Right now, he's probably slow dancing with a beach...  No, this isn't it.  Wait, I think it is.  No, it isn't.  When it gets to the hook?  You're probably buying her something.  No, it was that other one.  The, uh...  About the guy, um...  Let's see.  She says, like, she's onto him.  Oh, oh, you, you...  You better thank her.  You put on a good show.  Oh, are you, uh...  You put on a good show. 
[02:23:00]  Nice.  It's a compliment.  You put on a good show, I think it was called.  I forgot.  Something like that.  You do a radio show.  It's a very good compliment.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  Next time...  Put on quite a show.  You put on quite a show.  But next time...  You put on quite a show.  You didn't even know...  Da-da-da-da-da-da...  Yeah, that one.  All right.  Yeah, that was on there.  And, uh, yeah.  And then there's a...  Let me see.  A laptop.  Um...  Oh, boy. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Why don't you do the exchange?  What?  Yeah.  Why?  Say you're sorry.  What?  Why not?  Why?  Eh, sometimes you screw up.  You go, look, I'm really...  I was, uh, this, that.  I screwed up.  I'm sorry.  Is that what you would do?  I don't know, man.  Yeah, I would.  What would Jimmy Norton do?  Honestly?  Uh, if I was in the situation, I would say...  Because I have...  Screwed up.  I know you well enough to know you had probably erred in your life.  Well, I would say, uh, look, you have to understand, I was wrong. 
[02:24:00]  Uh, but I was in a situation for X amount of years, back to back, where I had a house  with the front door open, no one burglarized it.  Really?  For, for 17 years.  And then all of a sudden...  Wow.  ...I, I find myself where, hey, I'm allowed to leave my stuff out if a burglar comes good.  And then, and then I find myself getting back into a place where no more burglars can come 
[02:24:30]  in, and it was just a little too fast.  And I thought I was ready.  Yeah.  But I wasn't.  It was selfish, and it was stupid, and I should have been up front, and I'm sorry.  Ooh.  You know, because sometimes people want to know that it wasn't them, that it was where  I was.  And if I'm in a bad place, which I have been, you know, people, uh, that does mean something  to people.  Right.  I don't think Jimmy was listening, uh, too closely.  Tell us.  What I heard today, I would, I would, I would get the dry cleaning, the brand new phone,  I would ring the bell, put it on the doormat, and run as fast as you can. 
[02:25:00]  Run!  Run!  Run!  Um.  Or just make believe it's not going on, and just leave your stuff there.  I don't know how to deal with the situation at hand.  That's the beauty of it.  I just, uh, you know, maybe I'll just cut checks.  More checks.  That's what I just do.  He just cuts checks.  I'll just cut a check.  This will make it go away here.  I just cut a check.  Take this and this and this.  No.  You go, you do it.  You gotta do it.  It's.  No way.  It was no, it wasn't a, look, it wasn't a marriage. 
[02:25:30]  It wasn't a 10-year thing.  Right.  You screwed up.  I screwed up.  I'm sorry.  I don't want to be a screwed up guy.  Why?  I don't know.  I mean, I said you're wrong.  I mean, I'm not saying, believe me, I've never not screwed up.  I've never not screwed up.  How about you?  Have Keith do it.  I like doing the radio show with you.  Just have Keith do it.  Yeah.  There was too much going on there. 
[02:26:00]  I understand the pain and someone's feelings got hurt, but, you know.  Yeah.  It's over.  Just have Keith do it.  Seriously.  And maybe throw in a little extra.  Just throw in the dump check, the dry cleaning, and a new camera.  And have Keith do it.  Oh, my God.  These people are terrible.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I don't know.  They're just people making comments on Pound Dog.  That's a hell of a story, Ant.  Yeah.  And that's without really giving a lot of detail. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, of course.  It was burglars.  But you did very well.  People trying to rob the house.  I got to tell you what went on today.  I had a really bad day on the radio.  My eye is shutting.  The show was average at best, and Anthony knew that and decided to just say, F it, and tell  a crazy story to save the show.  I think there were some fun, bright moments early on.  We do do that, though.  We go into panic mode if we think we're having a bad show.  It's like, oh, I got to drag this one out. 
[02:27:00]  Okay.  How do you think Monster Rain came out of Jimmy?  Yeah, exactly.  Just fess up with that story.  And then we go, all right.  One day we were floundering.  All right.  Here you go.  Yeah.  Enjoy.  We swear we'll never tell a certain story, and next thing you know, we're just opening  up.  Like, why am I saying this?  What's wrong with us?  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  So that's kind of, you know.  Well, I'll have more details and stuff.  You know, I'm sure at some point after the exchange.  And you're getting text messages today that are cordial or more like what the F? 
[02:27:30]  What the F?  Okay.  I would say they're cordial.  They're civil, yet accusatory.  No, they're civil.  Well, there's a thing in there about, you know, that's taking a little while to do this  exchange.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And the ball's in my court, apparently, you know, to make the exchange.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, and they are things I need. 
[02:28:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  That's about it.  I'd just do it today, then.  Yeah.  That's what I'm figuring.  But bring Kenny.  Go down there.  No.  No.  Will it be done in Manhattan?  Uh, no.  It would probably be done in Queens.  Ah.  Yeah.  That's, uh...  You should meet somewhere.  What?  Yeah.  Meet somewhere?  A very public place. 
[02:28:30]  Neutral ground.  Oh, are you saying that, um...  A very public place.  So there's witnesses?  Oh, yeah.  And I'm not...  And I, uh...  And I, uh...  And I, uh...  And I, uh...  And I, uh...  And I, uh...  And I like this person.  But, you know...  Yeah, no, no.  I understand.  There seems to be a bit of a scorn thing happening here.  And, you know, it changes people.  Do it in a public place.  Preferably, uh...  On Long Island so you could, you know... 
[02:29:00]  Skedaddle?  No, so you could, you know...  Because you can't in New York City.  Oh, Jesus.  No, I don't think we have to go to that extent.  They're not Hamas and Israel.  Ah, they're sort of hard, Jimmy, at this point.  Everyone wants me to take a video camera.  Wow.  I don't think that would, uh...  Make a great YouTube video.  Maybe next time he'll think before he. 
[02:29:30]  That's the song.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I'm quite a show.  Yeah.  You both talk about different songs.  I think I...  I thought the same one Opie did.  Wow.  Well, that was the one.  So the Escalade was taken.  Yeah, the Escalade got taken.  I'm just like...  Brought back with a CD.  I'm like, oh, well.  And the CD starts...  And the CD starts playing as soon as you start the car the next time you got in it?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Was it, like, right up to the hook? 
[02:30:00]  Uh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was right there.  Did you have Keith start it?  Yeah.  Like Apollonia starting the car, the Godfather.  Anthony was going, Sunday, Tuesday, Friday, Wednesday.  Ah, teach me to drive.  Knowing you...  Yeah.  ...when you heard that, you laughed.  You had to have laughed at that point.  You had to have.  Yeah.  By the way, this just in, and it is true, the hostage exchange will be happening at FH Riley's 
[02:30:30]  at 2 o'clock today.  Somewhere between 2 and 11, I believe.  FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntingtonville.  Is this just in, Stump Rant?  I'm sorry, but...  Is there a little lunch special?  Well, there just might have to be.  No, what's happening is that this is the problem.  You got a little mixed up.  Oh, yes, Jeff.  They are, uh...  They both are so worried about this.  Right.  They said, look, we should put it off until November 14th.  Let's just do this exchange in Boston. 
[02:31:00]  But that's...  Where?  Why Boston, November 14th?  That's insane.  It's September 18th.  I'll tell you why.  That's two months away, Jimmy.  I'll tell you why.  Cooler heads prevail.  And you know what?  Oh, no.  They said that there's a place called the Wilbur Theater.  We go there.  Oh, all right.  10 o'clock at night, maybe.  We do the...  Everything is good.  But too many people want to see the exchange.  They say, what the heck?  You put on tickets for a pre-sale, 10 o'clock, 45 minutes from now.  Come up.  See me.  You see the exchange.  Works well.  By the way, there were two witnesses to everything that I explained. 
[02:31:30]  How many people are living in your house at this point?  There were two witnesses that were asleep downstairs and heard the ruckus, heard everything that  went on, and then sort of took some of the abuse as being accomplices with knowledge of  such events.  Sure.  And then... 
[02:32:00]  What?  Who are these two people?  Well, coins said of them friends of mine.  Oh, boy.  He's one of the witnesses in studio right now.  Could you point him out in the courtroom?  I sure can.  Yes.  He heard and saw everything.  And I believe he pulled the same thing I did when Richard asked me if he could... 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  My...  Yeah.  He just made believe he was asleep.  Wow.  Got it.  I thought you were going to say he rolled over and said, sure.  Was it impressive, Danny?  What?  What?  Me?  What?  What?  What?  Was it impressive?  The whole situation?  It was an interesting situation.  It was probably something that you had never been through before or witnessed. 
[02:33:00]  Not from that end of it, no.  Oh, God.  Heather from Jersey writes, so where's the part where we're supposed to feel bad for Ant?  I don't think Anthony's looking...  Shut up, you whore!  I don't think Anthony's looking for that.  Anthony's just sharing...  I'm not looking for sympathy from anybody, you dummy.  Anthony's sharing a part of his life, you know, this whole...  That's right.  This whole relationship was a huge part of the show for, I don't know, a month or two.  Things happen.  What am I going to say?  And people need the ending to the story. 
[02:33:30]  For Christ's sake.  I've been in steady monogamous relationships for forever.  And had nothing but regret.  Let me ask you a question.  Yes?  You know, if you had to say...  Yeah.  If you had to choose between two people burglarizing your house...  Uh-huh.  Would you say that...  Let me say that.  Mm-hmm.  Would you say that the burglar...  Yeah.  ...did a more impressive job of burglarizing the house... 
[02:34:00]  Jesus.  Are you going to...  Are you insane?  Just kidding.  The exchange didn't happen yet.  Are you nuts?  Do you actually want me to say who burglarizes a house better?  It's a very innocent question.  It's about burglary.  It's a very innocent question.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Hmm.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well...  I feel sorry for it.  Some people are better at certain aspects of burglarizing than others. 
[02:34:30]  Jesus.  I feel sorry for it.  I am still not getting into this.  Yeah, the instant feedback.  Pleading the fifth.  Definitely.  People are just...  I want to know.  People are just tuning in really fast, though, and they're like, what the hell's going on?  But they can't turn the radio off.  They came in way too late on this one.  Some people, if you leave the door open, they could open the house door with their mouths on the knob.  Really?  Well, that's important to know because some burglars that can handle a door like that, that's a tough burglar to walk away from. 
[02:35:00]  That's the type of burglar where you actually tell them where the keys are and you say, could you burglarize a lot more often?  Because the other burglar is just not burglarizing and leaves the doorknob alone.  Oh, Anthony, Cigars and Scotch wants to know if you were naked during this whole scenario.  Oh, no.  Are you insane?  Well, that door opened.  I was in Kevlar.  I had my 511 gear on. 
[02:35:30]  Wow, this door.  I don't want to.  Wait a minute.  I'm, um, I'm thinking of something to say I'm doing.  Was there...  Let me in!  Was the other burglar nervous?  No.  Not at all.  Wow, so...  And there were clothes in the closet.  So nobody, no one was nude during this exchange. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, I thought you said when the picture was taken.  No, no, no, no, no.  What were the first words when the door was opened and there was a burglar frown?  High.  Really?  Well, you've got to start with a high no matter what.  No, I think it was, I think it was, oh!  That was it.  Oh!  You're living a hell of a life, my friend.  See, I have two big closets.  Oh, I thought.  So do I!  Yeah.  Too big closets. 
[02:36:30]  No, no, no, no.  No?  I have two big closets.  Oh, two big closets.  And one closet.  Two girls for it.  No, no, no.  I have two big closets in my room that are in the hallway that leads to the bathroom.  One on one side of the hallway, one on the other.  One closet was empty.  One closet had a burglar in it.  The empty closet was opened first and looked in and I went, oh boy. 
[02:37:00]  And then the closets were walked away from and I thought, holy Jesus, not going to check  the other closet.  Nice.  You didn't say that out loud, did you?  That was my mistake.  And then a few minutes went by.  And then.  Was there some thinking going on?  Like, hmm.  Like, oh boy.  No, no.  It was just sheer.  Is that door going to be opened? 
[02:37:30]  It's like a video game, man.  You go into a room and you got to figure it all out.  And then when that, when I saw the reach for the knob and everything, all I was thinking  is, is there any way the burglar can hide in a sleeve of my shirt or something?  Yeah.  And I wasn't able to look in.  All I could see was the homeowner's face looking into the closet at the burglar.  I think an important question, though, is so many burglars will only enter through the  front door of the house.  Was, uh, let's just say, was one of the burglars more likely to use the back door of the house? 
[02:38:00]  I'm going to plead the fifth on any, um, any, uh, points of entry a burglar might, uh,  be, you know, might prefer.  That's a yes on one.  To use.  Because, nope, both burglars are front door entrers.  Sure.  Understood?  Understood.  Anable?  No, I could say that.  Really?  Yeah.  Both, you know.  No burglar enjoy the sneaking through the back door of the house once in a while? 
[02:38:30]  Let me think.  No.  No.  No, there wasn't any, um.  It's getting hot in here.  Well, did you get a...  Well, uh, uh, people are asking, did you get a, uh, knowing how paranoid you are of home  invasions, did you get a better security system or is your house still being burglarized?  Well, um, no, I haven't gotten a security system. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  Uh, my house does tend to get burglarized.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  By a repeat offender or many different, uh, individuals.  That's why I keep, uh, I keep, uh, I keep myself, uh, my gun loaded at all times.  Oh.  Just in case the burglar.  You keep shooting the same burglar, but they keep coming back.  With all the, with all the home invasions you have, and you should be shooting blanks  at this point.  You should have run out of ammunition.  Oh, God. 
[02:39:30]  Hey, um, so, why don't we, uh, when using mace on one of the burglars, would you say  that one of the burglars was more likely to not move their face away when the mace was  shot at them?  Hmm.  Because I've heard some burglars don't mind being mace in the fire.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's true.  Yeah.  Makes you much more likely to let them burglarize.  Did you ever handcuff the burglar? 
[02:40:00]  Never, uh, handcuffed, uh, the burglar.  No.  No.  I don't like treating the burglars badly.  Apparently not.  Here's the front keys, burglar.  We, uh, wow.  We, uh, we were supposed to leave 45 minutes ago.  Oh, I feel bad for the affiliates, if they're still with me.  Oh, how do you punch out of that one?  If they did, they're just stupid.  What can I tell you?  All right.  Well, there's more, uh, info coming out today. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  That's a big chunk of info, my friend.  It sure is.  Uh, Poe, could you bring the, um, uh, Escalade to, uh, the, uh, front of CBS, please?  Thank you.  That's all.  And the, uh, the exchange is happening today?  Well, I have to stop somewhere first.  Pick up some, um...  Dry cleaning?  Dry cleaning.  B&H?  How does that make sense?  A B&H photo.  Yes.  Yes.  Pick up a camera?  Microphone?  And, uh, and, and write another check, just to make sure it's okay. 
[02:41:00]  Ah.  Another check.  Anthony, you're amazing.  Uh, well, you know something?  After being in the situation I've been in for many years, as you know, uh, like I said,  I was in, uh, uh, you know, uh, the burglars usually stay for eight, nine years.  Mm-hmm.  The love of God.  Mm-hmm.  And then they really legitimately burgle me.  Oh, yeah.  I've had, wow, I've been ripped off to the tune of millions from burglars. 
[02:41:30]  But it's just amazing to me, though, that from that, someone all of a sudden installs a revolving door and says,  Come on in, burglars.  No, it just...  Hi, burglarized, goodbye.  Hi, burglarized, goodbye.  God bless you.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  Like, what's wrong with the girl you got?  Oh, jeez.  She played pretty good.  What's some of the names of the other ones?  Let's not go off on burglar names.  What, you don't want to do the bit now? 
[02:42:00]  Oh, let's not go off on any burglar names.  How about we do the bit now?  What's some of those other names?  Let's not...  I'll do it this way.  No.  No.  No.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  Anything else you want to add in?  I think I've added quite enough.  This is your show.  At this point.  This is your...  I've added...  It's your show, Elias. 
[02:42:30]  We're just enjoying the ride from the backseat, man.  This, you know, it's thrown out there.  I'm sure you'll hear more details and more stories of, you know, the exchange, things like that,  in future episodes of the Opie and Anthony program, starring Jimmy Howard.  Oh, is that a great tease right there?  But, well, it's not so much a tease as it's my life.  So it happens a day at a time.  And, you know, you throw it on there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very good.  All right.  That's how it works.  So that's where we stand at this point. 
[02:43:00]  And that's...  Okay.  If you could read between those, ooh, wickedly camouflaged lines I was throwing out there.  Anthony, I'm sorry to hear that you had a burglar.  A burglary.  Perhaps you could...  You're in need of my security services.  Yeah.  You don't need burglars over the house.  Well, why don't we go?  Because the affiliates got to clean up our mess we created here.  Yeah, we sure did make a mess.  I hope they stayed.  I hope they did, too.  I hope so, too, because that was some terrific stuff.  No, I don't need to go to a doctor. 
[02:43:30]  My eyes just close in this box.  When do you think maybe I hope we should go to a doctor?  This is what's going to happen.  I'm going home, and I'm going to take some Benadryl.  Ant's going to hopefully do a prison exchange and make this go away.  Right?  Yeah.  You've got to be done with it now, though, Ant.  Yeah.  It's too long.  Today's the day.  Just do it.  Yeah, I know.  Just do it.  Tomorrow, I definitely will feel a lot better.  And we got the audio of David.  We set up David, our intern, so bad.  If you weren't listening earlier, we'll explain again tomorrow. 
[02:44:00]  But the audio is terrific.  It is unbelievable.  But we had a great – should we explain the scenario so that they tune in tomorrow?  Basically, intern David, the Jewish kid that does kosher sports.  He's Jewish?  We had a film star on our show, and we made believe she was just a listener  that liked showing her boobs and doing other things.  And we got David involved with her, and it got really crazy.  He was enjoying himself, doing a lot with this girl.  And somewhere along the line, she said, yeah, I do have a husband, 
[02:44:30]  but he's back in Kentucky, and I don't care about him anymore,  and we're separated anyway.  This is fine.  Really making David feel comfortable, like it's okay what you're doing.  Next thing you know, we had a guy play the black, angry husband barge into the studio.  All hell broke loose.  David pretty much crapped himself.  When he tried to run away from the situation, he fell down a bunch of times.  The guy who was playing the angry black husband, he got beat up really bad by our security guys  because they got into their role. 
[02:45:00]  And we're going to play some of those clips tomorrow on the first half of the radio show  for the people that listened to the first half.  Right.  All right.  I have one more question.  Yes?  Do you ever have to deal with two burglars at once?  That's happened before.  Yeah.  That cost me a lot of money, though.  Oh, not recently.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  No.  Now he just deals with burglars one at a time, which he should, you know. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Smarter that way.  Jesus Christ.  You can't guard every entrance.  No, no.  Your house at the same time, right?  Unbelievable, man.  All right.  Amazing stuff.  Film any of the burglars?  Any burglary movies?  Oh, God.  All right.  We got to go.  See you tomorrow.  Hey, I want to thank BCN for sticking with us.  Yes, I did.  Good for them.  Thank you. 
[02:46:00]  We created a hell of a mess, and we apologize for that.  So did I.  Yeah, well, of course.  But we're used to your messes at this point.  No one's surprised at your messes.  Yep.  All right.  True.  That's it, I guess.  There's no way to end this one today.  Thank you, BCN, for sticking with us.  Just an amazing ending to today's show.  We'll see you manana.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
