<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast immediately following the September 11th attacks was a chaotic mix of raw emotion, patriotic fervor, angry commentary, and darkly comedic moments.  The show opened with callers expressing outrage and grief, using extremely offensive and violent language to describe their feelings towards those perceived as enemies, particularly Afghans.  One caller, J.D., recounted seeing a heavy police presence and Apache helicopters.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a furious condemnation of Rocco, a DJ from a competing Boston radio station (AAF), who had allegedly stolen his station van and planned to broadcast from a billboard, a stunt Opie and Anthony deemed tasteless and self-serving in the wake of the tragedy.  They used highly offensive language to describe Rocco and urged their listeners, the "Opie and Anthony Army," to publicly shame him.

Psycho Mark called in, sharing his experiences at Ground Zero and his negative encounters with Japanese television crews, using extremely offensive racial slurs in his description.  Other callers expressed their grief and discussed David Letterman's emotional monologue from the previous night; clips of Letterman's visibly distraught tribute to first responders and Mayor Giuliani were played.  The hosts interspersed their own angry commentary and offensive language with discussions about the overwhelming sadness and the need to move forward.  Dan Rather, appearing as a guest, expressed his grief and concern about the future, discussing the human cost of the attacks and the uncertainty of the coming war.

The broadcast featured numerous calls from listeners grappling with their emotions.  Robin from Boston sparked a heated debate by criticizing what she saw as excessive mourning in her city, arguing it detracted from the needs of New York.  Liz countered, emphasizing the profound impact on New York.  Other callers expressed grief, anger, support for President Bush, and the emotional toll on their families – one described his son's Little League team’s patriotic display.  The hosts discussed the nation's emotional state, the impending military response, the financial implications (including bin Laden potentially profiting), airport security, and the impact on reality television.  They also discussed a rumored nationwide candle-lighting ceremony and included a humorous segment about a picture of a disheveled Marlon Brando.  Metallica and P.O.D. were played throughout to create a sense of unity and defiance.

A recurring segment featured "Stalker Patty," a listener who described her experiences during the city's closure and then launched into an extended comedic fantasy about being an ant working at Godiva Chocolates; Anthony imitated her. Callers shared their experiences: one witnessed a patriotic display on a bridge; another discussed the abundance of donations at Ground Zero; Scorch from "Totally Nude Radio" called, discussing his fundraising for rescue dogs and criticizing Rocco's stunt. Several calls detailed emotional reactions, including anger at the ongoing suffering, complaints about insensitive T-shirts, and one caller sharing an email about a listener whose father died in the attacks. Kaylee offered sexual services to rescue workers at Ground Zero. The show ended with discussion of low-paying airport security jobs and insensitive merchandise.

Another segment focused on the insensitivity of other radio stations' promotional stunts, with the hosts contrasting their own decision to suspend "Whip Him Out Wednesday."  Numerous callers (Brian from Jersey, Joe from Hoboken, Norton, Uncle John, Tom, Blind from Bay Ridge, Jerry from Jersey, Scott, and Corey) shared anecdotes ranging from puns and jokes (like "goldfish are always naked") to criticisms of other stations' behavior.  One caller referenced a billboard stunt; another discussed a bizarre *Perfect Strangers* episode. The hosts discussed the balance between publicity and appropriate behavior, acknowledging their own past desire for attention but emphasizing their altered approach.  They planned a hard rock/metal playlist to counter the somber news coverage, concluding by self-describing as "two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut" and expressing uncertainty about the show's future direction.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  What up?  It's time to get really pissed off.  We're all set, but let's go!  What are we waiting for?  Enough with the sappy music on the radio. 
[00:00:30]  Let's go!  Let's get ready to kick some ass!  Nice!  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, ONA, what's up, Boston?  Hey.  Yo, that song just gave me chills like you would not believe.  I'm so pissed off right now.  Yo, that's like the most perfect song right now.  Don't tread on me.  You know, I put the vinyls on my car.  It says these colors don't run.  I believe America, we're just going to kick ass out there.  You know what I'm saying?  All right, it's time for us to get pissed.  We're all set. 
[00:01:00]  Stop with the sappy music on the radio.  Let's go.  I'm with you, brother.  Tomorrow we play Seek and Destroy.  That's right.  Now it's time to just get angry.  All right, Tim, thank you.  Hey, thanks a lot, guys.  A couple phone numbers.  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Everywhere else, 866-277-4.  Wow.  J.D., what's going on?  What's up, fellas?  Hey. 
[00:01:30]  Listen, what an awesome feeling playing that time.  It's Alex, but don't tread on me.  I'm coming across the Grand Central Parkway.  Caravan of cops bringing a bunch of guys up.  And a pair of Apache helicopters flying overhead.  Holy, what an awesome feeling, man.  Good.  Good.  Are you there?  Yeah, no, I'm listening to you.  I lost.  No, you're there.  Phone screwed up.  J.D., we heard you.  All right, we lost J.D., I guess.  All right, well, welcome to the show, everyone.  Yes.  What is new?  Who the hell knows at this point? 
[00:02:00]  Man.  Looks like any day now, any minute, at any moment.  That's what they're saying, right?  This whole war on terrorism can go down.  Smash the turbans, boys.  Frankie, what's going on?  Smash the turbans.  Rip them apart.  Suffocate the children with the turbans.  Wow, this guy is pissed.  Rip the dirt rags off the heads.  Bend over the kids. 
[00:02:30]  Put them in one hole and pull them out the other.  Pete Hamill had an interesting article in one of the New York papers today  talking about Afghanistan and stuff, and he ends the article.  Can I get that article or the paper that it was in really fast?  I don't know what.  He basically said at the end of the article that we would be doing them a favor  by bombing them and killing them.  Can I say something?  Because they just have miserable lives over there.  Can I say something?  Yeah.  You know, I know people don't want to hear this, but you know what?  People didn't want to see planes going through our frigging buildings either. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  And I'm sorry.  You know what I want to see?  I want to see pickup trucks loaded with SWAT teams running into 7-Elevens,  taking the Haji's out of there, throwing them in the back of the trucks,  with their arms sticking out of the trucks like Hitler did with the Jews,  and throwing them into the sea.  All right.  And then having all the firemen.  You know what?  All right.  Frankie.  What?  You've got to direct your anger into a better area than people in 7-Elevens. 
[00:03:30]  First of all, some poor Indian guy.  No, not the Indians.  Some Indian guy will be in the 7-Eleven going,  and what did I do?  I did not do anything.  Everybody wearing a turban is disrespecting the flag.  Not every towelhead is the enemy, my friend.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's too misleading.  America doesn't, we don't want to think anymore.  I see a turban, it's like taking a leak on my family.  Oh, boy.  I mean, that's me, but hey, I'll tell you what,  if you want to be a little bit more sensitive here and a little smarter, 
[00:04:00]  may I say something?  We need to be strapped, guys, for real, with gas masks as well.  Israelis, these children, they go to school with gas masks on,  because there could be some heavy biochemical warfare internally within the states.  So it's something to think about, and I'm thinking about getting these wild gas masks.  I've got to turn down my head.  Thank you.  Thank you, Frankie.  Thank you.  I've got to move on.  Let me just say, my head's pounding.  Yeah, not every towelhead is the owlhead. 
[00:04:30]  He's directing his hatred in the wrong area.  All right, let's move on to Drew.  Drew, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good afternoon, fellas.  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  I just want to express, personally express my gratitude for the job.  You guys are doing it.  I think you're keeping everybody's spirits up.  And I do agree that maybe some ass needs to be kicked,  but the previous caller, he does need to channel his energy.  It's a terrible, terrible thing down there,  and those cops and those firemen are going through one hell of a time.  And if people are going to get mad and direct their attention towards volunteering, 
[00:05:00]  helping, and supporting, it's going to be down there a long, long time.  And the only thing that's going to get us through is you guys and support  and just going through it day to day.  But I just wanted to let you guys know, hey, thanks a lot, man.  All right.  From the bottom of my heart, take care.  God bless you both.  All right, Drew.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Thank you.  Julianne is saying don't just show up to volunteer.  At this point, they have so many volunteers that you're supposed to.  They're sending the volunteers away, right? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, you're supposed to contact people at the mayor's office if you have people that want to volunteer.  And not just people that show up and say, what do you want me to do?  They need, like, specialists and whatnot.  Right.  I think the outpouring of volunteers have been huge.  All right.  Rob, you're next.  Hey, you guys.  Hey.  Thank Christ for playing Metallica.  Because if I hear Lee Greenwood one more stinking time, I'm going to puke.  Yeah, enough of the wishy-washy music. 
[00:06:00]  You know, we've had the week of that.  And now it's time for some kick-ass music about the ass-kicking.  We're going to throw this disgusting country of Afghanistan.  We'll do them a favor.  Now, I don't know if people in other cities really could grasp the audacity of this.  But it really hit home to me when I heard Rich Voss call and not plug.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's when it hit home for a lot of people, I think.  All right, Rob.  Thank you.  See you. 
[00:06:30]  That's pretty funny.  Daily News.  Pete Hamill has a great article on Afghanistan.  And this is just a miserable place.  He's just miserable.  And he ends his article by saying, but one thing we do know, there in Afghanistan, waiting  for the bombs to fall, live some of the most miserable human beings on the planet.  For them, dying might be as meaningless as living.  It's just a crap hole country.  War-torn for many years.  The people disgusted. 
[00:07:00]  Fed up with life.  The government corrupt, useless in supporting its people.  But it takes time out to support terrorists.  So whatever they get, they deserve it.  And the people that are there, I'm sorry.  How could you walk around a country where your government is just effing you over and supporting  terrorism and not even feeding its people and not turn around and just revolt against 
[00:07:30]  the government?  The people there, the so-called innocent people, they're just as guilty having left this government  in charge.  F them all.  Make it look like glass when you're done with it.  Here's some of the facts.  Let's melt that sand down to glass.  Here's some of the facts of Afghanistan, Anthony.  It's twice the size of Vietnam.  25% of the population on the verge of starvation.  25% on the verge of starvation. 
[00:08:00]  Only 12% of the land is farmable.  26 million people and only 31,200 phones.  Yeah, and I'm sure the government has all those.  No national TV network, 5 a.m. stations, no FM stations.  Is this one of our syndicated markets opening?  Are we going to have to go on an AM?  Only 14 airports with paved runways, 32 with gravel and dirt.  Only 31% can read.  Biggest export, if this doesn't say it all, heroin and opium.  They've been at constant war since 1979. 
[00:08:30]  Average life expectancy, 45.8 years.  That's going to get a lot lower, I think, in the coming weeks and months.  They bathe and drink the same water.  There's rats all over the city.  Country filthy with plague.  And just a bunch of diseases making its way around the country.  Infant mortality rate, highest in the world.  They don't even care about their own people and children.  They're too busy supporting terrorists and lining their own pockets and belief in this god of theirs that they don't take care of their own people. 
[00:09:00]  Their own people are the poorest in the world in this disgusting place.  And we'd be doing them a favor by just eliminating every living organism within its borders and starting over again.  That's it.  Afghani Disney.  I see it now.  Afghani Disney. 
[00:09:30]  Wouldn't that be great?  You just plow it over.  That's it.  Afghani Disney.  I like it.  Let's go to Joe.  Hey, Oven Anthony.  Great job you're doing out there.  What up?  Traveling on roadways, I've seen people diving out of traffic here and there.  So what the hell's going on?  They're stopping and picking up American flags that are blowing off cars and trucks.  If you're going to show the colors, goddammit, secure the colors to your vehicle.  Anything else is just unacceptable.  You guys are doing a great job.  One other quick thing. 
[00:10:00]  That pig after towelhead got a 13-year-old wife.  Shows you what sawdust he's got between his turban.  Well, he likes teens.  There you go.  Wow, we have something in common.  Okay, you guys are great.  Thanks a lot.  All right, Joe.  Take care.  You guys don't have to tell us that we're doing a good job.  We're all in this together.  We're just doing our little part.  We're just as pissed off as everyone else.  I like the Disney logic.  Hose it down.  Keep the rides going.  Just eliminate everyone.  Hose the country down.  And we move on. 
[00:10:30]  Let's go to Psycho Mark, who's been helping us out.  He's been at ground zero for, I don't know, since this happened a week ago.  I haven't left since.  What's up, Mark?  I'm sitting on a can right now back at the Hotel Roma.  You're on the crapper?  Dude, my pants are around my ankles.  They got a phone right in the bathroom.  Dude, I got TV in here and everything.  I could never leave.  All right, now the bong.  You're disgusting.  Dude, I'm so mad.  You hear him forcing one out. 
[00:11:00]  He's like, dude, I'm so mad.  Seems like a bidet.  Mark's doing his own bombing over there.  Yeah, look at him.  He's not waiting for the American forces.  He's bombing.  Laying down some heat.  Laying down some heat.  Mark's softening up the beaches.  What do you got, a map of Afghanistan floating in the bowl?  Oh, it's Donna Pikes right now.  Jesus.  What is coming out of Psycho Mark right now better than the people in Afghanistan? 
[00:11:30]  At least it smells better.  What's up, Mark?  Hey, oh, boy.  Where do I start down here today?  Oh, man.  We get almost thrown off the roof.  Well, we're getting thrown off the roof because of the Japanese television company.  NTV.  Nippon TV.  They are absolutely the worst.  Hey!  Come up to the roof, scurrying like little rabbits.  And guess this, right?  They've got a generator up there.  That they spill gasoline all over the roof and get it all thrown off.  Oh, man. 
[00:12:00]  The frigging Japs, dude.  They come up there.  I'm like, you people shouldn't be up here.  It was 1941, and you did the same thing.  Sea-sucking-ass.  Slant-eyed bastards.  Now, I love Japanese-Americans.  I don't want to make any difference.  Japanese-Americans are beautiful people.  These are news people that have come over to cover the story from Japan.  Now, may I explain something.  They don't speak one word of English, and they are the worst.  They're running around with these light meters, and they're screaming at each other.  And it's all in Japanese, but they're just the worst little bastards in the whole world. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  And that's my new enemy of the show.  All right.  We can't control this anger today.  I apologize.  Everyone's ready to go.  We're all chomping at the bit.  We're ready to fight now.  We've been through the sorrow, which, of course, we're still going through.  And a lot of people are going to take quite a while.  We'll never forget.  And you don't have to email us and say, you know, I hope people don't forget.  No one's going to forget what happened a week ago.  Relax.  But now we're chomping.  We're ready to go. 
[00:13:00]  The country's prime.  I've personally had it with the video, the sappy videos.  Let's try to make as many people cry a little more, just in case they haven't cried in the last four hours.  Enough with the sappy video, with the music playing, as you see the horrific video.  Enough with the stupid tribute songs on the radio with the clips, you know, mixed in with.  That's going to be the worst.  I am going to punch someone in the Q104.  What are you laughing at?  I'm laughing at Jared, line eight.  I know.  We're going to talk to him in a second. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, guys, real quick.  Laughing at that.  Yes, Psycho Mark.  Any chance.  I'm talking to a bunch of guys down here.  There's a lot of Verizon guys.  We need some really big American flags in here that we want to hang from some of the local buildings.  Those things seem to be, I think, in order to get a huge American flag, it has to be made at this point.  I think the big ones are all up already.  Yeah, true.  Around the whole country.  Mark, we put the word out yesterday.  A guy called us and said he had one five foot wide, and I think you need one a little bigger than that.  Just a hair.  Mark, I think I got something you can appreciate. 
[00:14:00]  I'm driving in today.  I see one of those double-decker tourist buses.  Buses, there's this son-of-a-bitch rube from I don't know where.  He's, it was just when I got into Manhattan, just about in the 30s.  And this son-of-a-bitch is standing up in this tour bus facing south with his little camcorder,  just taping as much as he could of the disaster area.  I hope he gets full-blown AIDS and dies in a week.  It is amazing, mate. 
[00:14:30]  Now, I'm getting pissed off at the people now that are coming into New York, tourists,  just to see this like it's some kind of attraction.  Now, this is actually where I was going to ask you guys,  the Opie and Anthony Army might be able to help out here.  If we can get some people down by Canal Street, regular New Yorkers,  to push back the friggin' tourists to 42nd Street.  Anyone that comes down, New Yorkers know when a tourist is coming.  They just, they know it.  There's no one that should be down here other than rescue workers, media, 
[00:15:00]  and people that are doing their jobs.  And gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  I think the campaign for the tourists that are just there  to photograph some kind of freak show that they think they're photographing  is show them your junk.  Show them your junk.  That's the call sign.  If you see someone with a camera and they're getting ready to take a picture of something,  just whip your junk out so they take that home to their rube families.  It's just brutal, dude.  Big, nasty trouser snake, old gnarly hairs and everything. 
[00:15:30]  Yuck.  Disgusting, right, Norton?  Yeah.  All right, Mark.  Here's one last flash for you guys.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  We'll see you soon, bro.  There goes Psycho Mark.  Let's move on to Chris.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  You tell us.  Dude, this morning, I got in my car, you know, the whole week, everybody's kind of frazzled,  you know, you're not into it, you know, you put on the radio.  Kind of frazzled.  Well, now, you know, forget it.  Yes.  Forgive me.  Completely frazzled.  And just in case we're not, we get to see all that sappy video and the sad music everywhere. 
[00:16:00]  Don't worry about it.  We're sad enough.  We're crying on our own.  I get in the car, guys.  I put on the radio and PLJ, I put on PLJ.  They're all sitting here with, you know, the two turds, Scott and Todd in the morning, blah, blah, blah.  They're going on.  And they're all happy.  And I said, all right, they're getting back to regular, you know, radio.  What they were doing was they were replaying exactly, you know, it was about 8.48 this morning.  They were replaying themselves live from last week. 
[00:16:30]  That's great.  Well, I hear, you know, they're talking also like, wait a minute, you know, they're joking around with each other.  I'm like, wait a minute.  But there's a plane that's heading, and all of a sudden, I swear to God, I pulled over.  My heart sank to my stomach.  I said, oh, my God.  Then I realized when they started mentioning the Twin Towers, they realized, you know, that's what they were doing.  They were replaying last week's tape over there.  And I was like, one of these guys wants to hear their own voice.  Chris, do yourself a favor.  The sports guys have been doing an unbelievable job through this whole thing.  Check them out, all right?  Switched right over to them. 
[00:17:00]  They're our morning show here at N.E.W. in New York, and they're doing a great job.  They really are.  All right.  All right.  Take care, guys.  You guys are doing a great job, too.  Well, thanks.  We don't need to hear that, though.  We're just in this together, and we're doing our little part.  All right.  Then you guys suck.  Yeah, that's cool.  I'd like to hear that.  It's at least a little toward normalcy.  Yeah, true.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Bye.  Hey, Ant, did you see the Afghanistan attraction at Epcot?  It's called the parking lot.  Nice.  I like that. 
[00:17:30]  Right?  Epcot's got the little countries.  They should put the parking lot, put a big sign, welcome to Afghanistan,  because I sure as hell hope that's what we make out of it.  And I hate to break into our continuing coverage of what is going on here in New York,  but we have some breaking news in Boston.  Yeah, yeah.  This will help us get back to normal.  All right, let me just strap in, because I'm afraid I'm going to get that embarrassing  feeling from this whole thing.  Are you guys ready for more fake radio?  Oh, let's go to, oh, God.  Fix the phones. 
[00:18:00]  All right, hold on, hold on.  Don't hit the mic.  Sit down.  Take a breath.  It's okay.  When the phones don't work, Opie gets ready to break them past the point of repair.  Because every day, it's a pattern.  Every day, the national phone.  It's a pattern.  Every day, the first call that we take from the national phone line doesn't work.  Stay there, Jared.  Stay there, Jared.  Don't go anywhere.  Are we ready?  Yes.  Jared.  Now we got Jared.  What's up, Jared?  What's going on?  All right.  Let me hold on to something.  All right.  Go ahead. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  Breaking news up here in Boston.  I'm driving on my way to work, flipping through the channels.  And wouldn't you know that Rocco has apparently stolen an AAF van and is nowhere to be seen.  Oh, my God.  Matty, apparently, is there by himself.  I just flipped over to AAF real quick.  Hey, we encourage everyone to flip over there to hear some fake radio.  So you can really get a load of what fake radio is like.  Matty comes on and says, hey, this is Rocco.  Hey, just kidding.  It's me.  I'm Matty. 
[00:19:00]  I'm all by myself.  I don't know where the hell Rocco is.  So he stole the station van.  Yeah.  Of course he did.  Of course he did.  This is a perfect time to try to do some wacky self-serving bit.  I don't know.  I bet you Dave Dickless was laughing his ass and slapping his ass off.  I'm disgusted.  I can see the meeting now in the office.  Dave Dickless, Rocco, and Matty sitting there going, hey, how could we capitalize on a tragedy? 
[00:19:30]  Unbelievable.  He's actually producing the show today.  So he stole the van.  He stole the van.  Is he going to show up somewhere and everyone's going to be like, oh.  I don't even know who was on before Rocco, but he's like, yeah, Dave's in a big tire and  he's real pissed and blah, blah, blah.  Oh, sure he is.  Yeah.  He's really back in his office loving it, getting sucked off by Rocco.  I don't know why.  I don't know why I get so, like, pissed off at this stuff.  But it's just, it all was planned in a room, in an office with Dave and Rocco and it's all, 
[00:20:00]  all right, what we're going to do, hold on, Jared.  What we're going to do is we're going to, all right, Rocco, you're going to steal the  van, okay?  And I'm going to be all pissed.  Matty, you stay back at the station and then Rocco will end up somewhere doing some, like,  bit and everyone will think it's real.  No, they, what, what moron is going to listen to this and think Rocco, who doesn't have the  balls to do anything, actually stole the AAF van to make some kind of a statement or some, 
[00:20:30]  something that I'm sure will figure into the disaster, the terrorist atrocity that took  place, that he is now going to try to make a wacky bit out of.  What is that?  Well, that means he's out there somewhere, so when they are, they have a target.  I don't care, I personally, listen to me, I don't care what his bottom line cause is  that they've all gotten together for this thing. 
[00:21:00]  This is self-serving radio crap and it bugs the, I mean, it really, really annoys me.  We've had certain things, we've been approached with certain things on this program that  we have just flat down said, no, we are not doing that.  You know, stupid, why don't you think we've even brought up how stupid some of the people  around here are with their ideas?  On a weekly basis, we'd come in and comment and tell you people how stupid some of the  people are around here and some of their dopey ideas. 
[00:21:30]  We won't even give them like that much now.  We've been approached with stuff that we, quite frankly, thought was not appropriate  at this time to even go there.  Promotions, certain things that we were asked to do, certain catchphrases of our show to  be used to raise funds or something.  If we want to, and we will help out, we helped out the other day trying to get some beer for  the emergency workers, and eventually we will figure out a good professional way to raise  some money. 
[00:22:00]  We're looking into a lot of different ways of doing that.  But it's not going to be, it's not going to be a radio bit, a gag that we're going to get  together and put on the radio like a sketch and this fake radio to try to not only raise  money, which is a great cause, but why can't we also, in raising this money, get some ratings  and get some attention for our personalities?  It's not about you.  It doesn't have to be about Rock Hole and Dave.  Tim, if you want to raise some money, raise some friggin' money. 
[00:22:30]  Tim, what's going on?  Oh, hey.  Anthony, everybody, what's up?  What's going on, man?  A.K.A.  Wannabe, private wannabe from the O&A Army.  What's up, bro?  Hey, Rock Hole is going to live on a billboard for a week.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hold on.  I'm going home.  And get this, dude.  It's right outside my wife's work.  Her office window looks right up the billboard.  Where's the billboard?  Right on 128.  What is his mission? 
[00:23:00]  What is the radio gag?  Let me just say something.  This radio gag is timeless.  One of the oldest radio gags ever, I think.  One of the oldest radio gags ever is the DJ on the billboard.  Bill Whitman.  Bill Whitman.  Not only that, I believe one of the jocks from AAF years ago was hired because they said,  oh, here's a guy that needs a job.  Look what he did.  He climbed a billboard and said, I need a job.  And he was hired to do a radio show. 
[00:23:30]  He said, I need a job.  Call this number.  And then AAF at the time goes, wow.  They had a morning show or something at the time.  Wow.  Let's see what this guy's all about.  Oh, hey, wait.  You know, they put him on the radio that morning.  He's like, hey, wait.  He's kind of funny.  Why don't we give him a chance to do a radio show?  He was a radio salt.  He was a radio old timer.  I don't know if you're aware of this, but Alexander Graham Bell received the first phone call ever on top of a billboard.  Yeah, I bet.  It's never funny.  On the billboard.  Marconi on the billboard.  Billboard bits always stick. 
[00:24:00]  Never.  W-A-F.  We are always fake.  Unbelievable.  The billboard gag.  Now, Tim.  Yeah.  What exactly is the goal of that fat bastard going up on the billboard?  I don't know.  I think to get a .0% rating.  Well, that's already starting to happen, my friend.  Yeah.  I think the O&A Army's job in Boston is to completely humiliate him.  Oh, which we will.  You know something? 
[00:24:30]  It's so self-serving.  Yeah, I stole the van and I'm headed for a billboard where I'll remain until we bomb Afghanistan.  I'm thinking, what?  We do something.  I'm sure there's a goal here.  Like, he's going to stay up there until whatever.  A certain amount of funds are raised.  It's so self-serving.  Just think of it as one big dunking booth.  There you go.  It's a giant elevated dunking booth.  He played into our hands once again. 
[00:25:00]  He's just going to hang out on a billboard and have our listeners just humiliate him around the clock.  You should have known better.  You should have just stayed inside, fat boy.  Is it possible to hit a person on a billboard with eggs?  Well, yeah.  I'm just curious if that would work.  I mean, not that you'd want to do that, of course.  No, of course not.  Oh, water balloon's full of pain.  Look, whatever the hell.  There's other things you could do.  I would just love to know how the ending of this bad radio bit, this self-serving, using a disaster to try to get your name in the media is playing out. 
[00:25:30]  That's just because you guys set out to bury him and you did it already.  Well, no.  We've got some work to do.  Our goal is to bury the whole station.  Oh, yeah.  But you know what?  You already did it.  Yeah, I mean...  No, we've got some work to do, my friends.  Oh, my God.  It might just be disgusting.  I don't know.  16 years I listened to them and...  Well, thanks for the surveillance, Tim.  All right.  I'll keep being told, man.  Yeah, where is the billboard?  Right on 128. 
[00:26:00]  Right next door.  Wouldn't it be ironic?  Right next door to Channel 5.  All right.  You know what I'm talking about on 128?  Target acquired.  Target acquired.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right.  There you go, man.  Oh, my God.  Oh, they live.  These idiots, they play right into our hands.  Now you're going to just be humiliated.  I stole the van.  And I'm going to go live on a billboard.  Dave, give me the keys.  I'm going to steal the van.  Hey.  That's a good idea, Rocco.  This is a great idea. 
[00:26:30]  I like that idea.  We could get awareness for the situation.  Plus, we'll get your name in the press.  And hopefully mine.  Rocco, if the press asks how this came about,  make sure you add your old pal Dave Douglas' name in.  All right, Dave.  Aren't you ashamed to...  It's a week after this happened,  and you're doing some self-serving, dopey, old radio gag.  Hey, Dave.  I was watching a rerun of WKRP in Cincinnati. 
[00:27:00]  I got a great idea.  Let's drop some turkeys from the sky, too.  Oh, my God.  That was funny.  Rocc Daddy.  Hey.  Hey, it's an email from Rocc Daddy.  What?  Oh, you join up on the website, his fan club.  It tells you.  They send an email out of everywhere he's going to be,  everything he's doing.  It's great.  And he signs it, Rocc Daddy?  It's great spy work for people that want to just be a pain in the ass to this guy. 
[00:27:30]  And he signs it, Rocc Daddy.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  All right.  Joe.  Yeah.  You're on the radio, Joe.  I'm on the radio.  Yeah, go.  Well, he's on 128 Needham.  There's a big billboard, and he's staying up there until he raises $107,000.  Oh, that's it.  There you go.  How about, you know, people are in a very giving mood right now. 
[00:28:00]  Please, douchebags.  And then the TV stations will come down and promote their little station.  Well, you know what?  It's not going to work.  We're going to humiliate you guys.  If you go on the air and set up some kind of a relief fund  and ask your listeners to send in donations,  you will get over $1,000 from your listeners alone.  Believe me, people are in a very giving mood when this happens.  There's no need to pull a billboard scam gag to get then not only raise the money, 
[00:28:30]  but more importantly, let's get our personality's name in the goddamn newspaper  and use this disaster to try to bolster ratings.  You're despicable.  You're disgusting.  My God, people die, and you're pulling a radio bit.  Unbelievable.  If you want to raise money, raise money.  He's going to be humiliated.  They're playing right into our hands.  Okay, well, have fun.  You know what?  I'll tell you something, though. 
[00:29:00]  I'll tell you something.  Give money.  Give the money to this cause.  Because, you know, it's a great cause.  As when we come up with how we will handle this  and raise some money and see who needs it,  we will do the same.  But the cause, great.  I'll push it for them.  Send money, because the people need it.  But that son of a bitch using this opportunity to get his name in the paper?  No.  We don't stand for that.  The ONA Army up in Boston doesn't stand for that. 
[00:29:30]  Humiliation.  Humiliation is the only weapon that we will use against this.  This son of a bitch using a tragedy to pull one of the oldest radio gags in the book.  And it's only for one thing, people, one reason to get Rock Hole's name in the paper,  which they will, the dopey lemming friggin' newspapers and TV stations  and afternoon personality schlocko is up on a billboard.  Well, you know, the manatees will cover it. 
[00:30:00]  The manatees will cover it, yeah.  But it's nothing but a disgraceful, self-serving radio stunt.  You can raise money in these situations by just asking for it.  People want to give.  You don't have to then shackle your own personality to the whole thing  and try to get some rating share points out of it.  That's nothing but a disgrace. 
[00:30:30]  But absolutely typical of a Dave Dickless and a schlocko.  They'll be ashamed of themselves.  All right, well, keep us informed what's going on up there.  We're very interested in this one.  Humiliation.  Humiliation.  I have a feeling he's not going to stay up there.  I think they're going to have to go to plan B.  Yeah, Anthony.  Unbelievable.  I have a feeling they're going to go to plan B.  I don't know, guys.  Hey, we decided that, uh...  Hey, look, I'm coming down. 
[00:31:00]  We decided, sir, I'm going to ride around the Popemobile all over Boston.  Well protected, and you can just throw money at me.  I have a feeling they will not be up on that billboard too long.  You want to give money to the cause?  Give money.  It's a great cause.  But you know something?  Man, that son of a bitch has no right to use a tragedy.  But just realize what it's all about, because, you know, we speak from experience.  Dave Dickless sent us to a kid's hospital where a bunch of kids were dying of cancer to try 
[00:31:30]  to hand out pies, and they sent a photographer so we would have photo ops in front of sick,  dying cancer kids with pies.  For nothing more than to try to salvage a relationship between the station and the mayor's office.  Right.  When we said the mayor was dead.  Right.  And we got down there, and we looked at these sick kids, and said the same thing I'm saying  right now to Dave. 
[00:32:00]  This is disgraceful that they would actually try to send us to a hospital where children  are dying to try to get the station in better with the mayor.  This is a textbook, Dave Dickless and WAF.  They don't know what's appropriate.  They're just tasteless, and it's disgusting me.  Disgusting.  Well, the radio station's being run by some chick from college radio, so. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Chicks are always funny.  You know, this is a great idea, Schlocko and Dave, if, you know, the soccer team needs  new goddamn uniforms, and you want to raise money for that, and you want to get up on  the billboard because our local soccer team needs some uniforms.  But people, you know, Schlocko, I don't know, people lost their lives, and you're turning  it into a bit, some kind of a radio stunt that you stole the van and you're headed for a 
[00:33:00]  billboard.  I'm disgusted.  It's so typical.  Stole the van.  Stole the van.  You didn't steal crap.  You pussy.  I can't figure out that he's still, you know, hanging out at a radio station in Worcester  after all these years.  Dead balls.  You'd steal the van and run over Dave.  With this type of talent, I thought he'd be syndicated all over the country.  It's brilliant.  Unbelievable.  And you're pissed off because you're so disgusted.  Because you're just not smart enough to come up with ideas like this. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, that must be it.  This is brilliant radio minds.  That must be it.  Hey, maybe Opie can steal Ant's chair until he gets something.  You know, when we were approached, and I'll say it right now, we were approached with some  type of use for the WOW acronym that we have here, Whip Them Out Wednesdays, to try to use  it to raise some money in some way, shape, or form.  And we said, no, it's not the thing to do.  It's not about us and this show right now.  It's about helping people out. 
[00:34:00]  It's much greater than our show.  It has nothing to do with this show.  Yeah, people call up and say, we're doing a great job, and I don't feel comfortable with  that.  I honestly don't.  We've been coming in here on a daily basis just, first of all, out of selfish reasons,  it helps us out just being here on the air.  And we've heard from a lot of people that it helps people out with us just being on the air.  It's not about trying to get WOW out there right now.  It's not about trying to promote the O&A show.  You know, oh, there's live shots all over.  Get your face on TV. 
[00:34:30]  It's not about that right now.  It's about trying to help out this country and the people of New York and Washington in  the face of adversity we never thought we'd see.  It's not about you.  So to turn it into some bit that just promotes your show, I feel, I actually, I'm getting  nauseous.  I'm getting feffing nauseous.  I got an instant feedback here.  Despicable.  Living on a billboard equals not funny.  Eggs being thrown at a fat man, always funny. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Humiliation.  That's the only way.  All right, we have to take a break, Ant.  We just wanted to spend like two minutes on that, but it went off.  Oh, you can't take it.  A little rant.  Disgusted.  Carolyn, or Caroline, I think it's Caroline, Brian.  Let me see.  Is this Caroline, Brian?  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Are you the Caroline that always calls us?  Yeah.  Okay, hold on.  We're going to go to you next, okay?  Okay.  Sorry to make you wait so long.  That's all right.  She wants to talk about David Letterman last night, which was just completely intense. 
[00:35:30]  We got some of the audio from his show last night.  It's definitely worth listening to today if you missed it, okay?  Yes.  And more of your phone calls.  Phones are just...  Fake-o.  Beyond busy right now, but...  It's fake-o.  But later on, if you want to try to get, you know, get through to us, if you're in New  York or the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-2774.  Wow.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:36:00]  Thanks for joining us as we try to move on here, I guess.  Yeah.  Caroline has been waiting for a while.  Caroline.  Hi.  How are you?  How are you doing?  Hey.  All right.  First, before I say anything else, I think that, I know all last week you went commercial-free,  and after you make good and all of that, maybe your sales department should, like, double 
[00:36:30]  your ad rate and then have half as many ads.  That way you make the same amount of money, but it wouldn't be, like, you know, 15 minutes.  That's not a bad idea.  She's pretty smart.  Don't you think?  It's not a bad idea at all.  Because it's the same commercials each time, so it's not like there'd be people missing  out on having ads.  You know what I would love to do on this radio show is have one sponsor to, you know, buy  the hour.  Yeah, there you go.  How cool would that be?  We could talk for a whole hour, and then, you know, off and on we say, you know, this 
[00:37:00]  hour's sponsored by Sam Adams or something.  Well, you want to give your throat a little bit of a rest.  You know, I can understand the need for some commercials, but...  Yeah, well, we'll figure something out.  All right.  Well, what I wanted to talk about was David Letterman last night.  Yeah.  Now, I'm a David Letterman fan.  I think he's great, and I was very curious to see what he would do.  I knew he probably had it in him to do something substantial because of what happened when he  came back from being sick, his heart attack and everything, but I was just blown away  by what he did.  I thought it was just honest and real, and it really, after that, it was like, now I'm 
[00:37:30]  ready to go back to regular programming and regular everything else.  That was like a cathartic release between him and Dan Rather, who was really showing  the strain, but it was almost like seeing, like, your father break down or something.  It was...  It was, you know, I don't know.  I was sitting in, lying in bed watching Letterman last night going, oh, this sucks.  Not because of what he was doing.  I was just so frustrated because I'm really trying to find some escape. 
[00:38:00]  But you see, you've had a whole week to get your feeling that this was his first chance.  No, I understand that, and I understand he had to do that.  I understand all that, but it's, when you see someone like David Letterman breaking down  and Dan Rather, you're like, oh, man, you know, it's, it's indescribable.  I'm tearing up, but, you know, again last night.  All right, now, well, see, I figured that was the last time that, like, a TV show was going  to make me cry for a long time because after this, I think it's going to be...  It is just so weird to see these guys that are usually funny and look at life very differently 
[00:38:30]  breaking down and crying.  It's just, I don't have words to describe what I'm talking about.  Dan Rather crying.  Newsmen never cry.  Never.  I understand why he did last night, and I have no problem with it.  He is a human being, like Letterman said.  But to see, you know, a hardcore newsman crying and then him and David Letterman holding  hands last night.  Yeah, there's a lot of hand-holding and shoulder-clasping and... 
[00:39:00]  It was brutal to check out last night, you know?  And they didn't bleep out any of the goddams or the Christ or anything.  It was just, like, pure and...  Yeah, it was real.  It was.  It was very real.  And then, I don't know if you stayed tuned afterwards.  I tried watching Craig Kilbourne, and he tried doing something, but it just didn't come close.  Oh, man.  Well, Craig, you know, he didn't know what to do.  Another guy that's a little too concerned with himself.  He wasn't...  I got to give him props.  He wasn't concerned about himself last night.  Did he do his own intro?  No, it was in... 
[00:39:30]  There was no real intro.  He just kind of all of a sudden, all of a sudden, there's the set, and all of a sudden,  there he is.  Ah, okay.  You know, all the shows are downplaying a lot of that stuff right now.  Yeah, he just didn't have the emotional weight behind what he was...  I don't know.  And then Bill Maher had Politically Incorrect with an empty chair, because Barbara Olsen  was on her way to L.A. to tape Politically Incorrect when she died.  So that was weird.  I tuned over there for a minute.  It was like, there's an empty chair.  I'm like, oh, more sadness.  Just sadness everywhere.  There's no getting away from it.  But now I'm over that. 
[00:40:00]  I tried, actually, because Mario Cantone was on Rosie this morning, and I tried watching  that, but...  He was?  Yeah.  I missed it.  What the hell?  That's like, he was bitching that she wouldn't put him on her show.  Oh, really?  I didn't know that, but he, you know, she was doing what you were saying, playing the music  and showing the videotapes and all of that.  I mean, that's, you know, how she had to deal with it or whatever.  You know, she had to do something.  But then she had on Rhoda, whatever her name is. 
[00:40:30]  It's Rhoda.  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's just go with Rhoda.  Valerie Harper.  Just Rhoda.  Rhoda.  Rhoda.  And then Mario Cantone was the comic relief.  He came out and did, like, sitting down, but was doing his act and was manic and, you  know, got everybody laughing.  And then at the very end, you know, he plugged that he was going to be at Caroline's this week  and, you know, thanked her for letting him come on.  And then it seemed like he was about to break down and say something, but then they just  went to commercial, so he didn't really get to be human.  He just was like the performing monkey, which I felt a little bad. 
[00:41:00]  The performing monkey.  Well, he's a little manic.  You know how he gets.  Yeah.  That's good.  The court jester.  Yeah.  That's a better metaphor.  Why don't we go through some of the Letterman clips because it's pretty intense.  I'll tell you, seeing Dan Rather and David Letterman crying and stuff, it's like I  watch a lot of the History Channel and Discovery Channel and whatnot.  And when you see the old guys from World War II and they're talking about their war experiences  and all of a sudden it's like this stuff is, you know, well over 50 years old at this 
[00:41:30]  point and they're still crying about it, you know.  And don't get me wrong.  I'm not bashing that at all.  I'm just saying this is how strong that is.  And you always get a little, you know, seeing an old guy cry is like, oh, you know, you've  reached that age.  There shouldn't be anything that you're crying about, man.  Well, maybe back then.  I feel bad just watching.  It's like the guy lived through life.  He shouldn't have to deal with stuff that makes him cry like that.  You know what it is? 
[00:42:00]  It's a simple rule of manhood.  Anyone older than you should not cry in front of you.  Is that the rule of thumb?  You know, guys younger than you, they cry, okay, but you know, when my dad breaks down  and cries every once in a while, I hate it.  I can't handle it.  It's just like, I don't want to think of my dad, you know, breaking down like that ever  because I think of him as a very strong guy.  Maybe with the World War II guys, it was that they didn't get a chance to cry back then  because it just like wasn't even done in the 40s. 
[00:42:30]  Something tells me they spent a lot of time weeping back then.  It's like when you see, like, Vietnam vets in front of the wall in Washington.  It's always very moving to see them.  Just losing it.  Yeah, it's really sad to watch that.  All right.  Well, let's go.  We're going to go through the clips, Caroline.  So thank you for calling, all right?  Oh, you're welcome.  All right.  Bye.  What's our pal, Caroline?  What do we got?  We got David Letterman when he first went on the air last night?  We got a three-minute clip at the open.  It's all right.  See, that's what's cool about a talk show.  We can play the whole clip.  On TV, they're playing like 10 seconds of it because, oh, we don't have time. 
[00:43:00]  Then we got to go back down to the live shot at Ground Zero.  We have to overuse the term Ground Zero a little more because nothing is happening down here.  But we need to show everyone more sadness.  They say it like they're the first people saying it.  We're down here at Ground Zero.  Call it the site.  You know, just call it.  They love using that term.  They just want some type of footage of themselves in a combat situation.  Right.  That's all they want is to be seen standing in rubble so it looks like they're in a combat situation. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  Is it good?  The shot good?  I got the wreckage behind me.  How's my hair?  Okay.  In three, two, one.  We're here at Ground Zero.  I'm so disgusted with everybody.  Carol Cohn.  WBAB News.  Carol Cohn.  Opie.  I'm here on the LIE.  A fuel truck.  Oh, my God.  Remember that? 
[00:44:00]  For some reason, Opie had to do news breaks on his wacky comedy show back at BAB.  Yeah.  And it would be for the stupider things.  She had carte blanche to just call my show with news.  She was the BAB news person.  And I'd be in the middle of having stripper, all sorts of debauchery happening on my show.  And all of a sudden, the hotline would ring.  Opie, it's Carol Cohn.  Mrs. Peterson's cat was found.  I'm going to do a report in three, two, one.  And then I have to roll tape. 
[00:44:30]  Opie, I'm here at the Peterson residence where a very subdued family is mourning the loss of their cat.  And Opie's like, oh, I got strippers waiting.  I got things happening.  I always laughed at that, that the fact that BAB had a news department.  It was the funniest thing.  You'd watch the news here in New York.  It's a very local station out on Long Island.  They do some great subdued community.  Suburban New York.  It should be said.  Yes, they do.  It should be said.  Absolutely.  I'll admit it.  I don't care.  I don't really give a crap about radio competition. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  I listened a little bit this weekend.  They did a very good job.  Yeah.  With the tragedy and localizing it and raising a lot of money.  Yep.  And they're a very effective local station.  I give them props for that.  But I always thought it was funny when you'd see maybe the mayor speaking, the governor,  some news happening, and all the mics are at the podium.  And you'd see ABC News, NBC News, your local radio news mics.  And then you'd see that WBAB logo on the microphone in front of the guy. 
[00:45:30]  And you're like, how are they going to spin this?  How does it affect the next Foghat reunion concert?  What are they doing the news like that?  How does this affect the zebra reunion show this Saturday?  But, like, we would be doing some crazy stuff when I came on board on your show.  I hear Randy Jackson's going to play all the instruments at the same time because the  other guys don't feel like leaving their jobs at the car dealership.  Are they going to ask the mayor about that?  So, you know, crazy stuff would be going on. 
[00:46:00]  And when I came on board with Opie at BAB, we'd be doing some wild stuff.  And I'd be amazed that this was going on.  And he'd be, all of a sudden, Opie's head would explode and go,  Oh, Carol's on the phone.  She's got to do this news break thing.  Oh, and they would yell at me if I didn't, you know, run the news breaks.  I'm like, oh, we're talking about someone's cat.  And time was of the essence, too, because you had to play the record.  Right.  So whatever break time you got, you wanted to spend with quality comedy or whatever kind 
[00:46:30]  of stuff was going on at the time.  Right, right, right.  And to have to then forfeit one of those segments for, Opie, I'm here in, I'm here in Syosset.  All right.  Great.  It should be said, though.  She's a great lady.  She's all right.  Yeah.  It was hard for the show.  She works her ass off, but she just doesn't fit there.  Yeah.  It was hard for the show that you were doing at the time to have to deal with.  Do we have time to start the Letterman Cliffs, or do we have to take a break?  Oh, Ben's saying we better take a break. 
[00:47:00]  We went really late because of your rock hole rant.  You know, I know, I had to, like, I had to wind down and drink, like, a quart of water.  Dan from Hoboken.  I'm pissed.  The only thing more painful than seeing an old guy cry is seeing a fat guy on a billboard.  Oh, that is going to get so ugly.  Oh, you don't want to, oh.  What happens when he's up there and gets cranky ass?  You know, there's no shower on the billboard. 
[00:47:30]  He always is cranky ass.  He's scratching back there.  Hey, Matty, scratch my ass.  Yeah, it's called the Big Dig.  You got to get back there and dig.  All right, a quick break, and we'll play the Letterman stuff, okay?  Yeah.  Caroline was bitching about the commercials, but...  Sweet Caroline!  Yeah, a new character was born on the show yesterday.  Good times never been so good. 
[00:48:00]  The feel bad.  The feedback on the Neil Diamond stuff was amazing.  Amazing stuff.  Fat man on a billboard.  Ain't no surprise.  All right.  The Letterman stuff is pretty intense.  We'll get into that next, definitely, okay?  Sweet Caroline.  Caroline?  It's Caroline, Brian.  Caroline!  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027-WNAW, New York. 
[00:48:30]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else that we're broadcasting to, 866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  If it's busy, keep trying.  We want to hear from Eladia, all right?  Roy.  So we got the David Letterman stuff, Anthony, from last night. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Some teary eyeball stuff.  Yeah.  They've had Dan Rather on.  And his first day back.  Doing his show since last week.  And they got a little choked up, the two of them.  Yeah.  Why don't we start with the opening monologue or whatever you want to call it, okay?  Here's David Letterman from last night.  Thank you very much.  Welcome to the Late Show. 
[00:49:30]  This is our first show on the air since New York and Washington were attacked.  And in the past week, others have said what I will be saying here tonight far more eloquently than I'm equipped to do.  It's terribly sad here in New York City.  We've lost 5,000 fellow New Yorkers.  And you can feel it.  You can feel it.  You can see it.  And watching all of this, I wasn't sure that I should be doing a television show. 
[00:50:00]  But I'll tell you the reason that I am doing a show and the reason I am back to work is because of Mayor Giuliani.  Very early on, after the attack, and how strange does it sound to invoke that phrase, after the attack,  Mayor Giuliani encouraged us and here lately implored us to go back to our lives, go on living,  continue trying to make New York City the place that it should be.  And because of him, I'm here tonight. 
[00:50:30]  And I just want to say one other thing about Mayor Giuliani.  As this began, one small measure, if you're like me, and you're watching and you're confused and depressed and irritated and angry and full of grief,  and you don't know how to behave and you're not sure what to do,  and you don't really, because we've never been through this before,  all you had to do at any moment was watch the Mayor.  Watch how this guy behaved.  Watch how this guy conducted himself.  Watch what this guy did. 
[00:51:00]  Listen to what this guy said.  Rudolph Giuliani is the personification of courage.  And it's very simple.  There is only one requirement for any of us, and that is to be courageous.  Because courage, as you might know, defines all other human behavior.  And I believe, because I've done a little of this myself, pretending to be courageous is just as good as the real thing.  He's an amazing man, and far, far better than we could have hoped for. 
[00:51:30]  To run the city in the midst of this obscene chaos and attack, and also demonstrate human dignity.  My God, who can do that?  That's a pretty short list.  The 20 years that we've been here in New York City, we've worked closely with the police officers and the firefighters.  And fortunately, most of us don't really have to think too much about what these men and women do on a daily basis. 
[00:52:00]  And the phrase, New York's finest and New York's bravest, you know, did it mean anything to us personally, firsthand?  Well, maybe, hopefully, but probably not.  But boy, it means something now, doesn't it?  They put themselves in harm's way to protect people like us.  And the men and women from the firefighters and the police department who are lost are going to be missed by this city for a very, very long time. 
[00:52:30]  And my hope for myself and everybody else, not only in New York but everywhere, is that we never, ever take these people for granted.  Absolutely never take them for granted.  There's Letterman.  Wow.  Very poignant stuff there.  It's so weird to hear him so serious.  Yeah, well, serious, serious situation.  But he's definitely echoing things that we've heard said. 
[00:53:00]  The Giuliani stuff, right on.  The mayor of the city has just been unbelievable.  I remember that last Wednesday, it was already being noticed what Giuliani was doing.  And we mentioned it on our show last week about how he's come to the table.  And really, you know, he had his detractors out there over the course of his term as mayor.  But, oof, that just seems like a distant memory of things that really didn't matter, you know? 
[00:53:30]  All right, ooh, the big argument over the Virgin Mary painting in the Brooklyn Museum that was made out of elephant crap.  Ooh, some important stuff there.  Should it be in?  Should it not be in there?  Should the museum get federal funding because it's in there?  Should it not?  Ooh, Giuliani, ooh.  What a monster.  Yeah, it just doesn't matter.  Now it's like, it just doesn't matter right now.  Who cares? 
[00:54:00]  Who cares?  All right.  Here's Letterman talking about terrorism from last night.  The reason we were attacked, the reason these people are dead, these people are missing and dead.  And they weren't doing anything wrong.  They were living their lives.  They were going to work.  They were traveling.  They were doing what they normally do.  As I understand it, another smaller group of people stole some airplanes and crashed them into buildings.  And we're told that they were zealots fueled by religious fervor.  And if you live to be a thousand years old, will that make any sense to you? 
[00:54:30]  Will that make any goddamn sense?  Wow.  Yep.  Getting chills.  A short clip about New York City.  David Letterman.  If you didn't believe it before, you can absolutely believe it now.  New York City is the greatest city in the world.  All right.  There you go.  And then I think we got, oh, okay, yeah, another Letterman clip.  Then we got the Dan Rather stuff.  I'll tell you about a thing that happened last night. 
[00:55:00]  There's a town in Montana by the name of Shoto.  It's about 100 miles south of the Canadian border.  And I know a little something about this town.  And it's 1,600 people.  1,600 people.  And it's an ag business community, which means farming and ranching.  And Montana's been in the middle of a drought for, I don't know, three years.  Last night at the high school auditorium in Shoto, Montana, they had a rally.  Home of the Bulldogs, by the way.  They had a rally for New York City.  And not just a rally for New York City, but a rally to raise money. 
[00:55:30]  To raise money for New York City.  And if that doesn't tell you everything you need to know about the spirit of the United States, then I can't help you.  I'm sorry.  He got really choked up.  Dave, getting all choked up.  Oh, how weird is that?  Dave.  That is really weird.  Our lives are so effed up right now.  Trying to make sense of all this.  Yeah, Cosmo checking and saying, hearing this over the radio really doesn't do it as much justice as when I watched it last night.  The look on his face is really what gets you. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, it's really bad.  He's barely looking up.  At any moment, it looks like he's just going to burst out into tears.  He's choking back the tears.  He's devastated like everyone else.  The Dan Rather stuff is pretty intense.  This is the first time he started crying?  It's along cliffs, I think, both of them are in.  All right, here we go.  Dan Rather.  Our first guest, of course, is the anchor of the CBS Evening News.  Here he is, Dan Rather.  Dan, come on up.  How are you, Dan? 
[00:56:30]  Well, it's not our best time, David.  Now, this is, as President Bush has described, the first war of the 21st century.  This will be long.  The casualties will be greater.  Let's face it.  We've already had more casualties.  I mean, 5,000 of our fellow Americans have been killed already.  When we talk about casualties, we've suffered casualties.  But there will be more when we send our sons and daughters into this kind of war, into this twilight zone that they're going.  There will be great casualties. 
[00:57:00]  Now, it remains to be seen whether we have the staying power.  Now, that's basically up to you and me and everybody in the audience and every American, whether we have the staying power, whether we have the will to stay with it.  So, we're now going to, we're now being put to the test.  But I'll tell you this.  If they could go down to Ground Zero here in Lower Manhattan, and you referred to it earlier, and see the following.  See those firemen?  I mean, it's a new place now, and we're headed to a new place, David. 
[00:57:30]  Time magazine had a wonderful essay this week and said, you know, we're going now to a new place where, you know, even the songs we sing will have a completely different meaning.  Example, you know, America, they're beautiful.  Who can sing now with the same meaning we had before of one stanza of that that goes,  So beautiful for patriot's dream, it sees beyond the years, thine alabaster city's gleam, undimmed by human tears. 
[00:58:00]  We can never say that song again that way.  David, you've been terrific to have you on your night.  I'm so sorry for this.  You know, the arrow grows late.  Yeah, you're fine.  You know, you're a professional, but good Christ, you're a human being.  The Osama bin Laden's of the world aren't nervous.  They soon will be, because we do have, with not just our military, we have other resources. 
[00:58:30]  We do have a terrible swift sword, and it'll be striking fairly soon.  Listen, Dan, thank you very much.  I know you have to get back to running CBS News.  It's been a pleasure to have you here.  God bless you.  Keep up the good work.  Oh, Dan Rather just losing it.  Wow.  That's brutal.  That was pretty tough last night.  Sean Newark.  Dan Rather has seen over 30 years of carnage, death, evil, and this made him cry.  Yeah.  Just think of what Dan Rather's seen over the years. 
[00:59:00]  That guy was...  And then Dave Letterman and Dan Rather are holding hands, just trying to get some comfort  from each other.  It was...  I'm like, oh, I need a top ten list.  Yeah, right?  I need some stupid pet tricks, Dave.  Man.  Something.  That's brutal.  It was...  That's brutal.  Yeah.  You can't describe that.  Dan in D.C.  Couldn't sleep after seeing Dan Rather lose it.  It made me feel very vulnerable. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Vulnerable is the word.  No matter how horrible the news is, they'd always get on the camera and run through it  without the emotion, for the most part.  And you're just accepted as that news from a faraway place, and that was it.  You know?  Oh, it's half a world away.  Might be real, might not be.  You know?  But this one, after everyone saw it a million times, and your news people are losing their  minds and crying, and Letterman's crying. 
[01:00:00]  Like, ah, this one is, like you said, going to change a lot of stuff and be around for  a while.  And what makes it even...  I mean, the stupidity of Americans right now...  Robin, Robin.  Wow.  We just plunked the line down, and you were already in a rant.  Who are you talking to?  I'm sorry?  Who are you talking to?  I'm talking to somebody in the car.  I'm sorry.  Oh, okay.  I was wondering, we plunked the phone down, and you're already going off.  Yeah, you're...  I know.  No, I'm sorry.  I'm just...  I've been very edgy lately.  We all have.  You're fired up. 
[01:00:30]  I just think...  All right.  Well, Robin, say what you have to say.  You're live on the Opie and Anthony show.  Okay.  My biggest problem is that people are acting like complete idiots over this thing.  I mean, what do they have Boston doing?  They have a whole bunch of people walking around with lit candles while all of the emergency  personnel are in New York City.  I mean, you're going to burn down Boston.  These people don't know what they're doing.  It's not controlled.  Everyone's doing stupid things.  All right, Robin.  I mean, why don't you just take your candle and start burning towels on Boston Common? 
[01:01:00]  That's going to make everything better.  Robin, slow down.  A lot of people are really out of their minds today.  What are you talking...  No one's starting fires with their candles.  Have you been walking around Boston Common in the last week?  Believe me, we've seen our share of candles here in New York.  You know, I mean, I understand that.  I mean, I understand that you need to have a memorial of...  Oh, what?  Slow down.  Slow down.  People are still smoking with their lit cigarettes and they're going to burn things.  Will you relax?  You're making it sound like there's no one in Boston right now to put out a candle fire. 
[01:01:30]  Robin, I'm not saying...  No, no.  Not everyone is in New York City to begin with.  And second of all, I don't see that happening.  I'm not seeing your point really here, Robin.  What are you...  What are you...  My point is, is this is something that has been going on for as long as history can remember.  Why?  And for people...  Just people killing each other over religious crap.  Yeah, but this is the first time we've watched one of our cities attacked by a foreign power.  Exactly.  And that's exactly what these terrorists are. 
[01:02:00]  And we're not going to fool you.  It's all media.  This is getting out of control.  I can't turn on the TV without some terrible cartoon of the Twin Towers.  I mean, I was just as devastated as the next person.  Robin, what cartoon?  You haven't seen the cartoon of the two...  Some little kid drew the two Twin Towers crying, hugging each other?  I've seen that on AOL, but not on TV.  Oh, no.  It's not on TV.  It was on the news.  All right.  So your point.  I mean, we've been struck by terrorism, and we're going to do everything we can to make 
[01:02:30]  sure this doesn't happen again.  What's the problem with that?  I understand that, but what has history taught us before?  What?  What has history taught us before?  The women TMS.  We're going to make sure it doesn't happen again.  You send somebody to rehab that doesn't think he's a drunk, they're not going to get sober.  These people don't think they did anything wrong.  You've got to have faith in what we're capable of accomplishing.  Hey, Robin, let me tell you something.  Back in the 30s, the late 30s, and through World War II, the thought of going against 
[01:03:00]  a power like Hitler and the Third Reich, along with the Empire of Japan, seemed like something  that was just unwinnable.  There was no way you could defeat this.  They were all over.  The power that they had was more than anyone could imagine.  They'd already conquered a lot of the civilized globe, and it seemed like there was no way,  and a lot of people said, there's no way we can win this. 
[01:03:30]  We have to stay out of it as long as we can, and the bottom line is, it involved the whole  world, which involved us, and through perseverance and pride and basic good versus evil, we went  on and won when we thought there was no way in hell.  And I don't think you can convey how people were feeling back then, but it's the same  feeling we're feeling now.  Terrorism, my God, they're hiding in crevices and cracks like roaches.  It's not an enemy like a country. 
[01:04:00]  It's not, it's, it's, it's a different situation, but the same basic thing is there.  It's a war.  It's going to be hard.  There are a lot of people who think it's impossible, but, uh, it's happened before.  Right, no, that's what I'm saying, and I understand that, but what happened after World War II?  America got this false sense of bravado, and then we have Korea and Vietnam that's going  to follow.  We don't need that again.  You know, uh, we just have to hope that our stretches in peace are longer than our stretches 
[01:04:30]  in war.  We had a great eight-year run, uh, uh, with, with little conflict in this country, longer  than eight years, actually.  With very little conflict that this country was involved in, and now, uh, that doesn't  come without a price.  Right now, we have to go into war mode and pay the price of that freedom that we live and  take for granted, and hopefully, uh, we can get past this and go back into another phase  of peace that we can enjoy again.  Bravo. 
[01:05:00]  That was very well said.  I mean, just like everyone else, I'm just as frustrated with what's going on, and, you  know, and...  You're wound too tight right now.  I'm sorry?  You're wound too tight.  Oh, yeah, well, you know, I'm a law student, so I'm supposed to be wound too tight.  I mean, you should have seen me in constitutional law last night, the poor professor.  Well, just go back to laughing, you know, and stay away from the rants, and you'll be  okay.  Well, you know, somebody's got a rant.  Robin.  Thank you.  All right, Robin.  Hang in there.  And you know one of the things with the vigils and stuff, I mean, I think, all right, why,  but it's almost like with this situation, people are not, it's not just the buildings 
[01:05:30]  or just the people.  That's part of it.  I think part of it is people are grieving and realizing that we took certain things  for granted, and you almost feel like, wow, is this way of life that I've taken for granted,  why didn't I enjoy and appreciate certain things?  Take it a little more seriously.  Yeah.  You're almost grieving the loss of support.  It is so good to see American flags all over the place.  I couldn't tell you the last time we saw an American flag just going about my business,  and I hope, you know, this doesn't just fade away in the coming months and stuff.  You know what, though?  I would hope we'd be in a situation where we can again take it for granted, because it 
[01:06:00]  only means that we're living our lives as Americans.  But it was always frustrating to drive around New York City, and you see the Puerto Rican flags  and the flags for this country, but you never saw the American flag.  Yeah, very rare.  Very rare.  And it's just good to see wherever you go.  She was a prime example of, you know, maybe over a week ago we'd have called her a bitch  and everything, but it's a prime example of how people are feeling right now. 
[01:06:30]  People are just losing their minds.  That was a confused girl, man, and pissed off and no way to really channel it.  We've had a few of those today, though.  People are starting to lose their minds.  I'm just freaking, what does this mean to me?  You've got to take a breath and, you know, calm down.  It's the waiting, you know what I mean?  It's like getting a two-hour lap dance, and now you just want to throw the chick down  and F her.  That's what waiting for this strike is like.  I know.  I know.  You're just being CTs.  It's more than a strike, my friend.  Yeah, well, you know, sure.  That's going to make people feel good at first, and then hopefully the rest of the country. 
[01:07:00]  He's going to realize, wait, this is going to take a lot longer than we thought.  It would be nice if it was one strike, though, and there was a little nuclear stuff in there  and just put a lot of people to sleep for a very long time.  It's an option.  Yeah, it's an option.  The enemy lives with us in the shadows.  Yeah.  That's what's scary.  The thing is, the enemy themselves can't run without the power base of money  and the hiding place, if you want to call it that, of these countries that support them. 
[01:07:30]  You can't just have two Middle Eastern guys, or even 20, that are going to go around  and really do the damage that was done this time if they don't have the backing of a country  that they can go run to hide in, that they can plan in, and that they can finance them.  We calmed down Gaddafi.  We calmed down Hussein for a while.  Do you think bin Laden, who is a multimillionaire, we've heard about his wealth.  Oh.  Can I jump in, though? 
[01:08:00]  It was reported today that they think that he made money off this terrorist attack.  Yeah.  He shorted some stocks and made a bloody fortune off this?  Yeah.  See, he shorted what stocks?  Airline stocks?  Tourism.  Tourism.  British insurance.  Insurance companies?  And made a bloody fortune off this attack.  Here's the deal with bin Laden.  He's rich.  He finances a lot of the research and stuff that goes into pulling this terrorism off. 
[01:08:30]  What do you think?  He's in his cave in Afghanistan with a huge pile of money?  No.  The money's in banks somewhere.  Governments have his money in their banks.  They have to be held responsible.  Those assets should be ripped away from him.  You know, you catch somebody in this country selling some weed, you take his house and his car.  Somebody like bin Laden, he's not in a cave with all of his gold there counting every coin every night. 
[01:09:00]  It's in banks, banks backed by governments that are directly responsible for what we saw last week and what we've been seeing over the years.  And those are the people that we have to bomb.  That's what the war is about.  Not about trying to, you know, step on some loose cockroaches that are running across your floor.  It's about exterminating what's in the walls.  This is it.  Do it.  Kevin, on line eight, why does Bush only want bin Laden? 
[01:09:30]  What about the rest?  He doesn't.  He's starting there.  Hasn't been saying that either.  It's not about bin Laden.  Mark my words.  We've got to start there, but we're not going to end there.  It's not even going to start there.  It's starting in a lot of places.  If bin Laden was given to us tomorrow by Afghanistan, you will still see Afghanistan be bombed.  You will still see a lot of countries be bombed when we finally strike back.  Because it isn't just him.  And we know it.  It's a whole network. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  From the top down.  Tony, what's going on?  It's a rat.  Tony.  Yeah.  You're on the radio, Tony.  Hey, I got to get a hold of you guys yesterday.  I'm from C-Town.  I'll tell you that we think you're great out here.  Thank you.  I'm a football coach for my son's Little League football team.  They had a game Saturday.  My son took his allowance and bought American flags to put on all the boys' helmets.  And I'll tell you, it's really moving to see a group of 10, 11-year-old boys take the field and on their own start chanting USA and play a game like you've never seen. 
[01:10:30]  Brought you to tears, Tony?  Oh, I mean, and it wasn't tears of sadness.  It was just here are these little boys, 10, 11 years old.  And like they said before the game, the one little boy goes, you know, this is for the little boys that can't play because their dads aren't there.  God, I wish the day would come where we could joke about this, Norton.  This is just the stuff these kids are feeling.  Right?  Right, Norton?  I wish the day was here where, I mean, I heard 15 different words that came out of this gentleman's mouth.  Thank you, Tony.  That just would have gone on a tirade of Norton in the most despicable manner that we've just grown to adore. 
[01:11:00]  I actually hit the cough button so I couldn't talk.  So you couldn't.  Yes, you did.  What are these days?  All right, let's move on to Sue.  Hey, Sue.  Sue.  What are you, Anthony?  Yes.  Hello.  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  Norton, keep your finger on the cough button.  I'll be nice.  I've been very nice today.  I know you guys were talking about the Letterman show earlier.  Yeah.  And my father's a retired cop. 
[01:11:30]  And I had him over the other night.  We were watching the news, and I saw him cry for the first time ever.  He didn't cry when his father died.  He didn't cry when his mother died.  It's just that whole brotherhood thing, you know?  How does that make you feel?  I was consoling him.  I mean, it was...  I hate when my parents cry.  I always have.  I know.  I feel guilty for punching them in the face.  I probably shouldn't have done that before we watched the news, you know? 
[01:12:00]  I always want to think of myself as the little kid.  You know, I'm the one that should be crying.  The all-powerful parents.  Yeah.  Right.  I hate when parents cry.  Oh, it was awful.  You know, it was...  Ugh.  Yeah.  All right, Sue.  But you guys are the best.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to regroup and try to get into some things.  Quickly.  Some distractions.  Yes, Anthony?  Alex from Jersey says,  What are you implying? 
[01:12:30]  Bomb Switzerland or destroy J.P. Morgan?  No.  If Bin Laden has accounts in Switzerland,  I'm not saying bomb Switzerland,  but part of the war against terrorism isn't just the bombing.  I said they are to be held responsible,  which means we should find out where his money is  and not bomb the banks,  but freeze those assets and use them,  use the money that he has in these banks  for relief to the damage he's done to this country. 
[01:13:00]  There's no reason this guy should have a penny  and we should follow the paper trail  that leads to where his money is,  take it and spend it on having this country recover  instead of letting him use it to destroy our country.  Do people realize we're going to do so much more  than just military action?  Right.  The war is very wide-ranging in the 21st century.  It covers a lot of area and one of them is banking  and that's got to be addressed and taken care of. 
[01:13:30]  The guy's got a lot of frigging money.  That's in a lot of banks.  Yeah.  His father made a crap of a lot of money in oil  and gave it to him.  And look at what he's doing.  Great.  Hey, Charlie, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, Owen?  Pretty good.  I was going to say,  the first time I heard you guys in Cliff Link,  you sucked ass.  But, you know,  I know you guys don't want any praise,  so out of pure respect,  I'm going to say you guys still suck ass  and keep it up, man.  All right, Charlie.  We're just trying to do our little part 
[01:14:00]  in this whole thing.  That's all.  I hear you, man.  We're way too close to the situation  and it has greatly affected us  on a personal level.  All right, Charlie, thanks.  All right.  Really fast,  someone's asking about Jim Brewer.  He did cancel his tour.  Someone wants to know that.  I think he's going to try to get that going  in October, I guess.  He's going to try to make an appearance  on our show in the very near future as well.  Cool.  Well, we're going to take a break  and we'll see where it goes next,  but I do want to talk about Marlon Brando.  It's a picture in one of the rag magazines. 
[01:14:30]  Him in his underwear.  You put it in such good perspective  back in the office when you said,  this guy was the Brad Pitt of his day.  And you look at the picture of him now  in that magazine.  I go, and now he looks like Ernest Borgnine.  And I said, you're insulting Ernest Borgnine.  Have you seen the picture yet?  He looks like one of those adult babies.  Yeah, the fetish people that like psychos and stuff.  We'll show Norton on the air  so he can get his response when we get back. 
[01:15:00]  So maybe we can get one chuckle in today.  Yeah.  I'm looking for one chuckle.  A chuckle.  Just one little chuckle.  As long as we can talk about Ernest Borgnine  for a little bit today.  He hasn't been spoken enough about.  All right.  He stole escape from New York.  We'll continue next.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:15:30]  Let's go to Matt.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, how's it going, man?  All right.  Hey, I just wanted to express my point of view  on the Dan Rather bit.  On David Letterman last night.  Yeah.  Breaking down rather, bitch.  Yeah.  You know what?  As far as I'm concerned,  all that was is just an opportunity  that he saw to save face  because ABC, CBS,  they've all been receiving hate mail  for their slanted one-way view  on the coverage that they've been producing. 
[01:16:00]  They've been knocking President Bush.  As far as I'm concerned,  President Bush is the best thing  that's happened in this country.  We're definitely in a lot better shape  having President George Bush in office  as opposed to Al Gore.  I can just,  I don't even want to think.  Matt, Matt,  I'm missing your point.  I mean,  he wasn't faking that last night.  You know what?  You know what?  These guys,  like last week,  they're knocking George Bush.  Oh, he's not doing anything.  You know,  hey,  the way I look at it  is George Bush  is doing a phenomenal job.  Yeah,  but that doesn't have anything to do 
[01:16:30]  with the fact that Dan Rather  was legitimately choked up  and crying.  I'm telling you,  I think he was trying to save face.  Oh, my God.  I think he was trying to get the people  to kind of forget about the comments  he's been making.  People are losing their minds today.  It's two different things, Matt.  That's a human being  showing emotion.  You can't fake that crap.  Oh, come on.  Dude, look at the old clips.  I think it was Cronkite.  One of the,  whoever read that Kennedy  had in fact died.  Yeah, Cronkite.  It was Walter Cronkite.  He took his glasses off.  And broke down on the air  very briefly,  and that was very  uncronkite-like. 
[01:17:00]  Dude, you guys,  Dan Rather,  as far as I'm concerned,  they're the biggest fakers.  Who knows?  He probably pulled a nose there.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  Before he went on the air.  Thank you.  You know,  people are losing their effing minds.  You know something?  Well, we'll entertain calls like that,  but I can't sit there  and then not carry on a discussion  as to why he believes that.  The guy,  he's just babbling,  so we hang up on him.  I don't give a flying crap  what Dan had to say last week.  I don't care about his politics.  Right, all I know  is last night  I saw some real emotion 
[01:17:30]  coming from a guy  that shouldn't be  breaking down and crying  in his profession.  In his profession,  that's like a huge no-no.  But he could give a crap about that,  push that aside,  and show everyone  he was a human being last night.  Mm-hmm.  Pfft.  Man.  Liz, you're next  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm really, you know,  I'm really upset  at that girl Robin from Boston.  She can sit up there in Boston  and bitch about them 
[01:18:00]  with the candles,  but she wasn't down here.  She doesn't have her drive to work affected  because her skyline's been removed.  She hasn't picked glass  out of her friend's feet  because they walked  all the way from the trade center  to Brooklyn.  She hasn't had friends  that were there  carrying out bodies  that you hug them so tight  when you see them  because you're so thankful  that they're alive.  Peace.  I see we got Dottie to organize.  All the lifers in prison  go over there  and just get that.  Get Middle East  off the face of this earth.  We've been infiltrating these people. 
[01:18:30]  They've been here for years  and years.  We train the pilots,  everything.  Boston,  you let them go through security.  And you're going to tell us  about peace?  No, I don't think it's time  to blame the entire city.  Yeah, so did New York.  What do you blame  in the entire city?  There's a lot of people affected.  A lot of people lost their lives.  A lot of people were saved.  Liz, a lot of innocent people  from the Boston area  were on those flights.  And a lot of people...  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I don't think Robin  is really conveying  how Boston feels 
[01:19:00]  about this whole thing.  Like any other city.  I'm just saying  from what she said  that she was affected.  No, she wasn't affected.  Maybe she was,  but not the way  we were down here.  Absolutely not.  Hey, we get to smell death  every day  when we come to work.  Absolutely.  How much fun is that?  No, it's not.  You know, driving to work,  going down to Jersey City,  putting on,  putting a surprise  onto the boats  for those guys  that are over there.  Friday, it was disgusting.  You don't forget that. 
[01:19:30]  You know what people  are carrying around  downtown these days?  Vicks.  You want to know why?  You have to, though.  You want to know why?  So they don't smell death.  Yeah.  But Liz,  they'll hold it  a little under your nose  and it makes it  a little better.  The whole country  is affected, though.  It's not just you.  You can drive  over the Verrazano Bridge  and you can see  there's a strip  that goes all the way across.  It's like an orange strip.  It's like a strip.  It's like a smoke adaption.  Yeah.  It's just that horrific,  horrific thing. 
[01:20:00]  And I'm not,  you know,  everyone has to deal  with this on their own.  But you know what?  Peace?  Forget peace.  We're at war  and I say  we've got a ton of guys  in prison  that probably know  how to work  nuclear weapons  better than half the military.  Let's calm down a little bit.  Send them over.  Let's calm down a little bit, okay?  This is crazy day.  Yeah.  We've entered crazy day  where everyone,  including myself,  has just lost their minds.  Do you blame anyone?  A lot of stupidity  is coming out  on the air today.  I mean, no. 
[01:20:30]  Is it a full moon?  I don't know.  No, she's right, though.  You know,  because people in prison  are known to be bright  and technologically.  I have.  That was a good point.  I have.  Well, if they're going to die,  if they're lifers.  I have complete confidence  send them over there  in our military.  If you live, you live.  If you don't, you don't.  But we're going to,  they're in prison anyway  for life.  I don't think we're down  to the point  where we need convicts  going up.  This is not a Lee Marvin film.  It's not the Dirty Dozen.  There you go,  Dorton.  We were right on the same page.  The Dirty Dozen. 
[01:21:00]  Remember that one?  They took the convicts out,  the lifers.  That's a great movie.  It takes five hours  to see on a weekend  because they've got to  put all the commercials in.  We see where you're coming from.  But it is definitely  not time to start  turning on other cities  because of some of the calls  I'm not turning on other cities.  I just don't think  it was right for her to say  she's tired of the candles  and everything else.  I agree with you.  I'm wrong.  I'm loving the candles.  I hope that continues.  I want to see more.  I want to see more flags,  more candles.  It just shows that 
[01:21:30]  we're getting together  for the cause.  I like the feeling of unity.  I like it.  Absolutely.  You know what?  Instead of everyone  saying they're German,  they're Irish,  they're Italian,  we're Americans.  Hell yeah.  I've been saying that  for years.  You know,  I've been looking around  on the subway lately  going we're all Americans.  That's right.  And I think different things  before this.  Like we're all in this together.  I don't give a flying F  what color you are right now.  We're Americans.  Ben, speaking of Boston,  who is in charge of security  at Logan Airport? 
[01:22:00]  I heard it was some moron  that used to drive  the governor,  Governor Weld.  There's no qualifications.  A driver.  Reliable source  that told me that.  A driver for the former governor.  One of the news stations  up there did a whole  investigation where  they were sneaking  all sorts of crap  past airport security  in Boston.  And they did it  two weeks later.  Like Massport went  into an alert  and then, you know,  two weeks later  it went by again.  Yeah.  One of the high profile  news stations up there 
[01:22:30]  did that.  Some of the people  that look at your bags  are very qualified  and some of them  if you've ever seen  are just the dumbest  looking creatures  I've ever seen in my life.  I was saying  when we go through Kennedy  here in New York  the people that are  looking at that screen  that x-ray screen  when you put your bag in  I swear to God  I think when they're done there  they take off those uniforms  and they put on  the little uniforms  of the people  that hand the tickets out  in the street.  Because I swear to God  they look like the same people to me 
[01:23:00]  and I don't know  what the hell  they're looking at that screen for  because sometimes  and you'd like to think  they know something  we don't know.  They know how the machine works  they know what to look for  and what the  but it looks like  they're looking at a  goddamn Flintstones cartoon.  They're just like  huh, what?  What?  And the bag goes through  and it's out  it comes out faster  than you can walk through  the beep beep thing.  How could you see  what's in that bag?  That's because they're anxious  to get out of work  and get back to the halfway house. 
[01:23:30]  Some of these people  are good  and some of them  are not qualified.  Well, you know something?  Thank God  they're stepping that up  and I hear we're putting  some sky marshals  armed  on domestic flights  and it's about time  and I hope we  put those double doors  like  LL  has on their planes.  Hey Sandy, what's up?  How you doing?  Alright.  We have one of our  assistant chiefs  and he's also his brother.  One's a fireman  in New York City  and one's an ESU cop  in New York City 
[01:24:00]  and they're missing  and we're going to have  a candlelight vigil for them  Thursday night  at 730  and we want to know  if you guys can put it  on the air.  Yeah, where's it going to be, bro?  It's going to be  at Roslin Rescue Station 2  on Mineola Avenue  which is exit 37  on the LIE.  You want people to show up?  Yes, we want as many people  to show up as possible.  We'll get a lot of people there.  Give the address again  and the time.  Okay, it's 155  Mineola Avenue  that's Roslin Rescue Station 2.  Okay.  It's at 730 p.m.  this Thursday night. 
[01:24:30]  Alright, and it's  what exit off the LIE?  It's exit 37  off the LIE.  Right on.  This is something  you guys could do.  A lot of people wondering  what the F can I do.  Here's something.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you, Sandy.  Appreciate it.  Alright, bro.  It's lose your mind day.  Everyone really...  It's amazing  the progression  we have watched  over a week  of the psyche  of the whole country. 
[01:25:00]  It's just amazing.  It goes from  the disaster  the day of it  of just everyone  with the disbelief  and then the anger  and sadness  all mixed up  and then a week later  we've mutated  this emotion  into losing  your mother-effing  minds.  I don't blame anyone.  I don't either.  We're all waiting now.  I wanted to show  the picture of Marlon Brando  in his tighty-whities. 
[01:25:30]  Now it's like,  who cares?  Haven't we seen enough, Opie?  Haven't we seen enough?  Marlon Brando  in the tighty-whities.  Where's that picture?  Just show Norton.  You haven't seen it yet?  No.  Scott, what's up?  What's happening?  Hey, bro.  Yeah, so I just wanted to say  about the candle lighting  tonight at 10.30.  I got an email.  It said they're going to  take a picture  from a satellite.  Yeah, is this true?  Paul from D.C.  emailed me.  It says,  I just heard that  the U.S. has asked  that everyone step out  on their lawns tonight  at 10.30  and light a candle. 
[01:26:00]  They will be taking  a satellite picture  of the U.S.  and posting it  on the news  tomorrow morning.  Can our satellites  maybe be over  at the countries  who are going to be  bombing soon  and watch those lights?  I'd much rather  watch those lights  on satellites.  I wonder how that's going to  I mean, the city lights  are going to just drown out  the candle lights, right?  There's X amount of them  probably not.  That's probably the question.  All right, well,  it says,  please pass this on  to as many people as possible.  And what does it say?  What time?  10.30 tonight.  10.30 tonight.  Now, what if you're  in different time zones?  I don't know. 
[01:26:30]  10.30 what?  Because to have  the whole country lit up,  you're going to have to  do it in your various time zones.  What about superimpose it?  There you go.  Just put a lot of white dots.  That guy's lit.  Superimpose it.  Just put a lot of white dots  on a map.  Use some CGI.  Yeah, I...  You know what?  I don't know.  I want to play this song  we started the show off with.  Again.  I want people to crank this up  as loud as they can in their car. 
[01:27:00]  Because this is the next phase.  If you don't get goosebumps  from listening to this song,  I don't know what to tell you.  If you want to make noise,  you want to beep your horns,  we'll show some unity right now.  Oh, you've seen  the Marlon Brando, right?  Isn't that something?  Look at him.  Oh, is that awful?  And my tiny writings.  God, I love Marlon Brando.  Make all inquiries  as to who...  as to who took this picture.  I want all inquiries made. 
[01:27:30]  He's a mess.  Gotta love him.  Isn't that amazing?  They got a shot  of Marlon Brando  looking out his window.  He's looking out his window.  A big, huge picture window  with a few of those wood strips.  in front of it.  And he's...  It's something you  would be uncomfortable  even seeing Gandhi in.  You know what I mean?  Like it's just this little  yellowed underwear.  They don't have to look clean. 
[01:28:00]  And he's leaning  against the window.  His belly  so big and round.  And this,  as Opie said earlier,  was the Brad Pitt  of his day.  The guy was a sex symbol.  The women loved him.  And now he looks like  an adult baby.  Yeah.  A big, fat adult baby  that needs mothering  and breast milk.  Yeah.  Nice.  And then you watch,  you know,  a streetcar named Desire.  He's a sex symbol.  A rebel.  He looks like  a fat superhero.  And he looks like  a streetcar in a diaper. 
[01:28:30]  Look at the size of him.  He's Diaper Man.  Yeah,  what magazine is that in?  It's Star.  Star Magazine.  The one that has  Kathy Lee Gifford  on the cover  with Frank?  Look how I,  look how I mess  with my body.  Hey, there you go.  I got a chuckle today.  Thank you, Anthony.  A little chuckle.  All right.  They call him obese,  which to me  is such a fine word. 
[01:29:00]  Obese.  Ah, don't you just love  saying that somebody  is obese?  It's beyond fat.  You know, sir,  your obesity  really bothers me.  He is obese.  Oh, he's awful.  Let me see that.  Greatest American actor.  I gotta get a better,  I gotta get a better look at it.  That's gone.  It's over.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Food has always been  my friend,  the caption on the picture.  Look, God, 
[01:29:30]  I've massacred my body.  I want  all the members  of the five bakery firms  to send cakes.  Boy, they couldn't  carry him up those stairs  after they brought him  back to the hospital now.  Right?  I love you, Grandpa,  from your grandson, Frank.  He's fatter  than Luca Brasi. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, that's a shame.  All right.  And he's got  bitch tees,  as they call them.  Big ones.  Baloney breasts.  He's as hairy  as Ernest Borgnine.  The gray hair  all over him.  He looks like  a white,  silverback gorilla.  Poor guy.  All right.  We're going to take  a break, Anthony.  Yeah.  We need to pump  some energy  into our audience.  All right?  So, I suggest  you crank up the radio. 
[01:30:30]  We're going to crank up  this Metallica tune.  If it doesn't give you  goosebumps,  then go F yourself.  If you want to make noise,  you want to beep your horn,  you want to flash your lights,  whatever,  a sign of unity.  Okay?  Here it is.  That's what I say we do.  Phase two, kick ass.  We're going to crank this up  and we'll be back.  O.P. Anthony.  O.P. Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  That's P.O.D. 
[01:31:00]  Live.  It's the O.P.  and Anthony show.  Great tune.  Great video, too, man.  You seen the video,  yes, man?  Unbelievable.  The whole guy driving in his car,  out of nowhere,  he's reaching for like a chip.  He just gets broadsided by a bus.  And the whole video goes into  super slow motion  of the bus just pushing him  and him flashing back  throughout his life. 
[01:31:30]  Great video.  I mean, cinematically,  if I might say,  it looks fantastic.  Really, really cool  if you catch it on M2  because MTV don't play it.  I was just going to say it.  If you got M2,  you can see it.  One of the best videos  out right now,  P.O.D.  and MTV don't play it.  Well, they're too busy  playing all the sappy songs  to make us sad.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thanks for that.  Thank you.  Hey, Frankie,  you're next on  the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:32:00]  Actually, I'm sorry.  My name is John.  I was talking to my friend Frankie  when Rick clicked me on.  I got to tell you guys,  thank you very much.  The last week,  I don't think I've smiled once  because it hasn't been  feeling right to even  listen to music  because I've been sticking  to radio pretty much.  But when you guys  clicked on that tune  for the reason why you did,  I had to actually  pull my car over  and I'm not even exaggerating.  I was doing about 110.  You guys kick ass  and we should be  blaring that over the edge.  We should hook up speakers  to the F-16s  and we're blasting 
[01:32:30]  those guys.  We should be blasting  that song.  Tomorrow we play  Seek and Destroy.  Nice.  All right, Frankie.  You guys rock.  Hang in there.  And by the way,  I almost forgot to mention  after seeing this  Marlon Brando photo,  if you want to see him  in person,  he'll be on a billboard  in Boston.  Hey, I just got  another chuckle.  Thank you.  I knew that.  You got to take him  where you can get him.  Thank you.  I was reading  an interesting article  in the New York paper  today about 
[01:33:00]  this whole tragedy  and how  it has completely  wrecked  reality TV.  Good.  Think about that.  Oh, yeah.  Big Brother Survivor.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How can you look  at reality TV  ever again?  Fear factor.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Oh, he's going to  bungee cord.  Wow.  Oh, that sounds dangerous.  Oh, wow.  He's he has to hang  out in a coffin  of rats for two  and a half minutes.  Wow.  That's scary.  But I think it's 
[01:33:30]  interesting to watch  their relationships  develop.  I mean, that gift  is so entertaining.  Is there going to be  a problem in the house?  Who knows?  I think these two  are having a tiff.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Reality TV.  You want reality?  I think we've had  a week's worth  of the most reality TV  I want to watch.  Believe me.  I want to go back  to cartoons and sitcoms.  Right.  I don't need any more  reality in my life.  I need moronic  entertainment.  Yeah.  Man.  I never watched 
[01:34:00]  a reality show,  so I can't comment.  I never saw one.  Well, I think...  There was all the rage  there for a while there,  Jim.  Yeah.  I know.  I heard about it.  Yeah.  With some hindsight,  now, you could almost  tell we were getting  to the point of,  like, we had been  at peace for so long  and been prosperous  for so long  that reality television  was just keeping us  so goddamn entertained  until we got a dose 
[01:34:30]  of the real reality television.  Yeah.  I truly believe  the live executions  were right around the corner.  And we're going to be  shocked at that now?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, live execution.  We said it late last week.  The jolting of being awakened.  Or yesterday.  Hollywood's going to have  to come up with something  pretty amazing  to shock us now.  Mm-hmm.  To entertain us now.  We've seen it all.  Yeah.  There'll be a movie  about this  probably within two years.  Less. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, maybe less.  Oh, yeah.  By February sweeps.  No.  Jake, you're next  on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, guys?  I love you guys.  Thank you for that song.  I can't explain it enough.  It was, it's just chilling  and after all the depression  and tears for a whole week,  it's just miserable.  I can't explain to you  how much I love you guys.  Yeah, we've got to pump  some adrenaline back  into our audience  just a little bit  here and there.  Definitely.  I'm in the Marine Corps Reserve.  There's a good chance  I'm going in.  I want that.  I'm going to get  an MP3 player 
[01:35:30]  put it into my brain bucket  so I can hear it  as I'm killing people.  Nice.  The same way that we,  you know,  everybody played  America the Beautiful  this morning.  I think you guys  got to unify  all these radio stations.  Maybe we could blast  this all together  as one country  tomorrow morning  at 8.48 a.m.  or whatever it was.  And maybe you could  unify some more.  All right, Jake.  Thank you.  Hey, real quick.  Can we play  What's My Ethnicity?  Huh?  What's My Ethnicity?  Oh. 
[01:36:00]  I might.  I give up.  I'm Indian, man.  I want to thank you guys  for that also.  Telling people  to direct their hate  the right way.  Yes.  I've been hated  like crazy  this entire week  and people can care less  if I'm willing  to die for this country  born and raised  in Queens  and people are ready  to chop my head off  just because I look  like a damn sand  you know what.  See that?  That ain't right, man.  It ain't right, man.  I grew up in Astoria  and when they took  those towers down  they took a piece of me  and I want to thank you guys.  Commend you  and the other guys  on your station. 
[01:36:30]  Don and Mike,  Ron and Fez  that you guys  have been telling  these knuckleheads  that are just  filled with rage  to put it  in the right place.  Don't forget  the sports guys.  They're doing  a great job  in the morning.  Them too, man.  Yeah, definitely.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  Thanks, Jay.  Here it is.  The rumor  that's been circulating  about the U.S.  requesting Americans  to light candles  for satellite photo.  It's a rumor  and if you read it  you can kind of  figure it out.  The guy says  feel free to light a candle 
[01:37:00]  but don't say cheese.  You won't be on  candid satellite camera.  The movement  to have everyone  in the U.S.  light a candle  on the evening  of Friday,  September 14th  as a memorial  to the victims  of the September 11th  terrorist attack  appears to be  fairly successful.  Certainly,  we saw quite a few  candles on display.  Whether it was  misunderstood  or an embellishment  it's a hoax.  If you read it  it says  the U.S.  asked to do this.  What organization?  Just the U.S.  And it's impractical  unless every city 
[01:37:30]  in the country  is going to  extinguish  all of its  artificial lighting  at just the right time.  A satellite photo  simply isn't going  to pick up a candle light.  Go ahead and light a candle  but don't feel like  you have to say cheese.  All right.  Let's move on  with Eileen.  Eileen,  what's up?  Hi,  I just wanted to say  that guy Matt  saying that Dan Rather  is crocodile tearing it  that's unbelievable  and terrible  for him to say.  I mean,  we're fighting  we're in a war now  and it's not about power 
[01:38:00]  and it's not about land  and it's not about religion  and it's not about civil liberty.  It's about hate.  Pure and simple.  Well,  they hate our lives.  They hate our way of life.  They hate our way of life.  Right.  They have stated,  Bin Laden has stated,  kill Americans  and their allies,  civilians and military.  There's an interview  that he stated,  our battle against  the Americans,  he said in an interview,  is far greater  than our battle  against the Russians.  We anticipate  a black future  for America.  Instead of remaining  in the United States,  it shall end up  separate states 
[01:38:30]  and it shall have  to carry the bodies  of its sons  back to America.  There you go.  This is what that  son of a bitch is saying.  Exactly.  That's what he's saying.  And it's just terrible.  This is a dose of reality  in the entire America  to realize  that this is evil.  How do you fight evil?  How do you fight hate?  How do you do that?  Big bombs.  You kill it.  You kill it.  So, exactly.  We're going to have to do that.  I'm just afraid  what the repercussions  are going to be  and how it is going  to affect us.  But I want...  America is filled  with such smart intellects 
[01:39:00]  and then at the same time,  Jesus,  it's terrible.  But I just hope  we wake up  and we realize  that this is evil.  This is something  quite different.  It's not money.  It's not religion.  It's not civil liberties.  It's not about land.  It's a great point  you make, though.  Part of the diversity  that everyone talks about  about America  is that we have  such smart,  resourceful people  that can rise  to any occasion, 
[01:39:30]  build whatever need  be built  to fix  whatever problem  we have.  And on the other hand,  we have some of the  stupidest sons of bitches  walking the earth  on this country.  God bless diversity.  We invented electricity  and there are still guys  that will break  a foosball table.  Wait, hold on two seconds.  Even further than that,  Norton,  we invented electricity  and we still have people  that will poke tweezers  into the socket hole  and kill themselves. 
[01:40:00]  That's the spectrum  that America is right there.  But, you know,  we have the Dan Rathers  and David Letterman  and Klein.  I mean,  they're young.  I feel for the  younger generations  and just how everything  is reality TV,  like you said,  and this is what  they're growing up with.  I'm not hearing much  from the young.  That scares me a little bit.  And, you know,  that is scary.  We have a lot of...  Right, so.  Right, so.  People didn't believe that.  We have a lot of  18 or 34-year-olds  that listen to us  and I haven't heard  many 20-year-olds  calling our show.  Well, I'm one of them. 
[01:40:30]  And I have a child  and I feel so much for her  because I'm like,  this is our future  and Rome did fall.  No one could believe  that back then.  It could happen  and that's not  a crazy statement.  That is exactly  what can happen.  We have to realize  we need to get our,  you know what,  together.  Learn the damn language.  That's one of the factors.  We don't even know  this, what this guy's saying.  We don't even understand him  and that's part of our  fault in intellect  with the intelligent  people out there  that are supposed to be like,  we're giving them  billions and billions 
[01:41:00]  of dollars to know this.  But part of the problem  is the language barrier.  Can you believe it?  Language?  Americans don't need  to learn Afghani.  No, we don't need  to learn it.  But the intellect,  these people that  know exactly what it is  and all those  31,000 phones  that are out there,  I mean,  they need to really  buckle down  on the language.  All right, Eileen.  Thank you.  Thank you for sharing today.  All right,  we're going to move  right on to Suzy.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Never thought I'd hear  the day when Anthony  used the word poignant.  Hey, we have some intelligence. 
[01:41:30]  I just never liked  showing what I've learned  throughout my life.  I like keeping it  simple and stupid.  Yeah, come on.  Just the way I like it.  Suzy, how are your  big heavy breasts  holding up under all this?  They're still there.  Nice.  So what do you have  today, Suzy,  that hasn't been said?  Just two quick things.  One is that it came up  earlier,  how this doesn't happen  on El Lala.  Israeli planes never get  hijacked.  We should, you know,  mimic their level  of airport security. 
[01:42:00]  Unfortunately,  I have a story  where that isn't true.  I went to Israel  a couple summers ago.  I was having a terrible time.  I was trying to leave early  and I thought I got  on a standby flight  a couple days before  my scheduled flight.  Went through the whole  stupid thing.  Did anybody pack your bags?  Whatever, whatever.  They give you a sticker  saying you passed.  Ended up knocking on the flight.  Had to come back  two days later.  They approached me,  started to do the thing again  and they said,  oh, you got the sticker.  You already passed.  Go right through.  It was from two days before,  you know?  Oh, interesting.  They didn't look anything.  Huh. 
[01:42:30]  You know,  keep that sticker on there.  It's got to...  Yeah.  Just like anywhere else.  All right, Susie.  Lapses in security.  Thank you, Susie.  Have a good one, guys.  All right, we're trying.  Let's go and check in  with Cleveland today.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Pretty good.  I just want to tell you,  we love you guys up in Cleveland  and I love the Don't Try It On Me.  I'm a big Metallica fan  and the Seek and Destroy  is definitely a great song.  If you listen to it,  Ben Madden should be  running and hiding  because the words go perfectly 
[01:43:00]  because we're going to  seek and destroy his ass.  And I had a couple other songs  that you might want to play  from a band called S.O.D.  They're not together anymore,  but there's an album called  Speak English or Die  and then there's another song  on the album called  After the Middle East  because that's what we should do.  We're going to ask them all up  and just bomb the hell out of them  because we need to do that.  So keep up the good work.  We're listening to that  up here in Cleveland.  Right on.  Thanks, Kevin.  Hang in there, all right?  Hey, Carlos, what's up? 
[01:43:30]  What's up, yo?  Hey, man.  What's going down?  Look, I'm an E-5  in the United States Army, man.  I'm ready to send something down range.  Anthony hyping me up, dog.  I'm serious.  I'm ready to go.  Let's go, man, right?  Man, I'm waiting for the call right now.  My boy that was in the Marine Reserve,  you know, I feel you, dog.  We're going to line them up.  For real.  We're going to line them up.  I'll show you some real reality TV  when a Maverick missile  is in the mud at it.  Real.  All right, fellas. 
[01:44:00]  All right, Carlos.  Nice.  Do it up, man.  Stalker Patty gave us a gift  and a note today.  Patty.  She's still trying to get into the studio?  Well, thank God security  is here to keep her out  because I really,  I don't want her in here.  Do you want to read the note from Patty?  Yeah.  Here's Patty.  Stalker Patty.  Of course, those of you,  I don't know if everyone's familiar  with Stalker Patty.  We've known her since we got here 
[01:44:30]  to New York like three or so years ago.  She has the body of an ant.  The body of a small, tiny insect.  The ant.  And she's been stalking this program,  more so Opie.  For three years.  For three years.  She's semi-homeless.  Sometimes she has a home,  sometimes she don't.  Semi-retarded.  She works at McDonald's.  And we just found out  she got a part-time job 
[01:45:00]  at Godiva Chocolate.  Like putting a kid in charge  of a candy store.  An ant working at Godiva.  I love it.  They set me loose.  I clean up the mixing vats.  My mandibles.  I chip it away.  Hi, guys.  How are you today?  It's been a difficult and emotional week.  Look, last week when Staten Island was closed,  I didn't understand the details  with why. 
[01:45:30]  What?  I don't even understand what you're saying.  And I thought my borough was under attack.  My borough?  Is she talking about the borough  that the ants live in?  I thought somebody kicked over my ant hill.  I was lucky.  I was able to stay with American Red Cross  at a shelter in the city.  That's great.  Patty has a friggin' home somewhere.  Who the hell knows?  And she's using up shelter space  because she can't get back to Staten Island. 
[01:46:00]  Swim.  Well, I've seen them take sticks  and cross little puddles of water.  Each one.  They grab a stick, drop it, go.  They're like the mind of one.  And on Saturday,  Nancy from Wins took me home  to Long Island for the night.  It was great.  We ate in a diner  near where Anthony used to live  in Elmont.  I never lived in Elmont. 
[01:46:30]  I lived in Elwood, Long Island.  Which is in North Carolina.  Which is about 20 miles away.  Yeah.  And who cares  if you went to a diner?  Who cares?  The town that man's supposed to live in.  Awful.  Dope.  Baked potato, no.  Too early.  Sunday night was my first night home.  And I'm giving you these chocolates 
[01:47:00]  from my new part-time job.  I just started a good day for chocolates.  This is my third day of work  and every day  I have to try the candy  so I know what I'm selling.  She's pilfering  from the company.  Wouldn't that be fatty?  Patty.  Wouldn't that be funny  if Patty like gained a pound?  She'd be fat  if she gained a pound.  She's like a rail. 
[01:47:30]  This woman's like a toothpick.  Where is this wacko today?  Yeah.  We gotta get her on the phone.  I'm sure she's still up there.  Since I can't eat all of this stuff  it's just too much for me.  I wanted to pass it on to you  even though you've been  very serious on the show.  At least I feel better  hearing your voices.  At least you didn't change.  You're still there.  I wish I could come down  to visit in the studio.  I just wanted to come last week 
[01:48:00]  to say hello.  Sometimes it makes one feel better.  It makes one feel better?  It makes one feel better.  Stop waxing poetic.  Stupid.  I hope you enjoy the goodies.  It's a great morale booster at least.  Oh yeah.  Godiva chocolates  more than make up  for the tragedy we've seen.  Eight guys and a box of Godiva's.  Right.  Why don't you send us some junk  we can rub it on our faces too. 
[01:48:30]  Chocolate is not a morale booster for guys.  Chocolate.  My special job at Godiva.  I crawl under the counter  and find lost pieces of chocolate  with my giant mandible.  Actually I unload the trucks  because I could carry  a hundred times  my own body weight  and my giant mandibles  with my huge head  thorax and abdomen  and my thorax and abdomen  connected with that little piece of thread. 
[01:49:00]  How do I live like this?  I always have to put an extra hole  in my belt  because they don't make them  that small  to fit around  that little piece of thread  that connects my abdomen  to my thorax.  How does anything  pass through there?  I don't know.  I'm just an ant.  I don't know how I work.  I eat the Godiva chocolate 
[01:49:30]  and all of a sudden  it goes from my thorax  my huge mandible  down my little neck  my little ant neck  into my thorax  it's got to pass through there  to get out the back.  Then somehow  all that Godiva chocolate  squeezes  through that little thing  that connects my thorax  to my abdomen.  It's no bigger than a hair  of a human.  We've seen them.  I'm in great fear  after this attack 
[01:50:00]  that children might  turn a magnifying glass  on me.  You know  you put it in front  of the sun  a magnifying glass  who didn't do that  as a kid?  I just moved  into a child's ant farm  I'm very happy.  I'm in chamber 165  right next to the larvae.  That's a promotion, huh?  Because last time  you were working above.  Yes, I'm down  I'm pretty down  into the ant farm now. 
[01:50:30]  I'm hoping to work  my way into the larvae chamber  where I actually get  to use my own saliva  to block them up  to protect them.  Patty, you used to have  to help drag  the beetle leg  into the colony.  That was my job  last week.  I'd be the one  that had to carry  the big cricket leg  sticking over my head.  One time I picked up  a little leaf.  You probably saw this  when I was a kid.  When you were a kid 
[01:51:00]  I picked up a leaf  to bring it back  to the hull  and a gust of wind  blew me  to me  which was about  5,000 miles.  But for you  it's about 2 inches.  Very difficult  to be an ant.  I'm still a virgin  I haven't met  that special army  ant yet.  I like the military guys.  They don't care  what comes in.  I saw them  attack a wasp once.  It's amazing  you think a wasp  got a stinger 
[01:51:30]  we just got those  little thin things  between the thorax  and abdomen.  Yet they beat the wasp.  I was very happy  we partied.  We partied  in chamber  647.  One day  I'll meet the queen.  I'm scared  of termites.  All ants  are scared  of termites.  We look the same  only they're more  transparent  but we're mortal  enemies.  I wish I was 
[01:52:00]  a ladybug  sometimes.  They're pretty  and they don't  have that thing  between the thorax  and abdomen  that's so thin  I don't even know  how it puts  anything in the  abdomen.  Fiona.  Fiona?  You guys  I'm so torn  I can't stand  with Stalker Patties  on the phone  or in the studio  with you guys  but I cry  every time  Anthony imitates her  he does Stalker Patty  better than  Stalker Patty does.  I like the  Stalker Patty  aunt.  That's the best. 
[01:52:30]  Oh boy.  She's not upstairs?  No.  That's too bad.  Well thank you  very much.  Anthony thank you  for another  chuckle.  I need a few  today.  Hey Dan  what's up?  Hey what's up guys?  Yo what's up?  Hey you guys  just came on  and told you  not too long  ago and you guys  have done a good  job in the past  couple of weeks  and made a big  difference right  here for a lot  of people.  Yeah we're just  you know  kind of selfish  it keeps us 
[01:53:00]  sane  just coming on  here.  The reason why I  called actually  was I was trying  to get in since  last Wednesday  last Wednesday  night I was  driving back  from my job  down in  Mellon  and there was  a couple guys  that kind of  puts you into  mind how the  guys on the  Air Force  based down  in Dover  are right now.  There's probably  about 10 or  15 people  standing on top  of the bridge  all these guys  and they had  their face paint  on no shirts  on and just  the wind from  the trucks  arriving underneath  the bridge  had these flags  pulled so straight  and so tight  above their heads  it was unreal. 
[01:53:30]  And so they  were all pumped  up man so it  was great to see  that.  Oh good Dan.  Well thanks for  calling.  You guys take it  easy.  Alright bro.  One more call  we'll take a break  here.  Jim what's up?  Hey opening  Anthony how you  doing guys?  Alright man.  Just a quick  comment about the  reality shows you  were mentioning  before.  Gives a whole new  meaning to the  word survivor now  doesn't it?  Yeah how can they  call that show  Survivor?  I won't be  watching that the  same way.  Yeah we were  talking about  reality shows and  you know how they  compare to what we  saw the last week. 
[01:54:00]  Blind from Bay Ridge  writes talking about  talking about  reality shows the  guy that won the  mystery town X is a  New York City  firefighter and he  was one of the  first people that  went into the  building and he is  missing.  Yeah.  The guy that won  the grand prize on  that mystery town X  show is missing.  He's a murder in  New York City  firefighter.  Small town X thing.  Yeah that's reality  television.  All right we'll take  a break we'll be  back.  All right.  Opie and Anthony 
[01:54:30]  1027 WNEW  And you're checking  out the Opie and  Anthony show.  Our buddy Scorch is  checking in and  Hey Scorch from the  kingdom of nakedness  Hey guys.  Totally nude radio.  Hey I was on the  phone with you about  actually I was on  hold for 25 hours  about three hours ago  and I was listening to  your what Rocco was  doing in Boston.  Hey wait I want to  back up though.  Yeah please.  The last time we  talked to you you  were going to have a  dog expert.  Oh man let me tell  you something. 
[01:55:00]  What a waste.  It fit so well with  my show.  It was like I sold  nothing.  What was the bit?  The dog expert  coming on the show.  He sucked man.  He sucked.  The best dogs to  pick up chicks with  in the park.  But he didn't do it.  What?  He didn't like it.  It was worthless.  It sounded like he  just didn't.  It was just a guy  trying to sell books.  A bad day in the  kingdom of nakedness?  It really was but  things are a lot of  looking up.  We've got things  happening.  Can I talk about  the Rocco thing  first?  Yeah but hold on.  I want to ask you 
[01:55:30]  a couple more  questions.  How is Scorch and  Totally Noon Radio  handling this crisis?  Club naked.  Here's one of the  things I want to  talk about.  First of all to  everybody in the  city.  Man my heart and  you know me I'm  really not that nice  of a person but my  heart goes out to  everybody because  that's an awful  thing.  Here's what I want  to do.  One of the reasons I  called today is  because I want to try  to get your people  down there to do  what I'm doing up  here.  I want to get  stuff for the  dogs.  Okay because a lot  of people forget  the search dogs. 
[01:56:00]  You're out of your  effing mind.  Oh so I'm doing a  dog food thing on  Friday.  We had to raise  like 120 grand.  Do you know how  many old people  you're going to have  showing up?  Well that's okay  though.  You know what I  mean so they won't  have dinner for a  couple of days.  That's okay.  Radio has lost  its mind.  Hold on Scorch.  So you're going to  broadcast somewhere?  I'm just going to  broadcast from my  station.  They don't have  enough money.  And you're  encouraging your  listeners to come  down with dog food?  Well we're going to  have to bring dog food  to feed the puppies  man.  Oh there you go.  Because I'm a  humanitarian for the  dogs man.  Every piece of this. 
[01:56:30]  You know Ben is  finally laughing.  Ben is losing it all.  Yeah.  The dogs are fine  Scorch.  We got them little  booties and  everything.  Well you got them  booties yeah but  they got to eat.  And I also heard like  Heidi Tong say that  they needed milk too.  Is somebody going to  bring down little  fire hydrants for  them?  There you go.  They need that too.  Alright Scorch is  doing his part.  He's going to be  collecting dog food.  Let me tell you  though.  We did a blood thing  up here and they  had which is a very 
[01:57:00]  cool thing.  They had so much  blood they had to  turn people away by  the end of the day  which is kind of  nice too.  There you go.  Alright.  But it's just how  far are you guys  from me?  You're not like all  that far away right?  Right now tops  three miles.  Hey Scorch, Keith  the cop wants to  talk to you about  the dog thing.  This is one of our  pals from the radio  show who's at what  we call Ground Zero.  No doubt.  He's there every day  observing everything  and digging and  doing all that stuff  and he wants to  talk to you about  the dogs.  Keith?  Hey what's going  on?  Hey Keith what's  up bro?  Hey Scorch how 
[01:57:30]  are you pal?  How you doing man?  Be nice to Scorch.  I think you might be  a little high right  now.  Hey hey hey.  I remember Scorch  from up in Boston.  What's up man?  So what's up?  Listen to be honest  with you Scorch  they got more dog food  than they know  what to do with man.  Okay then let me ask  you what because I'll  have a drive for whatever  you need the most I will  get people up here to  give me what do you  guys need the most  down there?  You know the last couple  days so much stuff has  been coming in.  The dogs would have  to eat.  They're going to give it  away the dog food  because there's so much  of it.  How about  paper magazines and 
[01:58:00]  paper towels?  Scorch.  Scorch.  This is what's going on.  As soon as someone  announces what they  need down at Ground  Zero then they just  get flooded with that  item.  Okay.  So they don't need  the dog food.  You guys have so many  supplies right Keith?  It's phenomenal.  Like last night the big  thing was the Vicks and  then I was standing  there and all of a  sudden people just  started pouring in with  Vicks.  Bags of Vicks.  Yeah I was listening to  a radio station.  They were trying to  figure out why the  rescuers down there 
[01:58:30]  need Vicks.  I'm like hello.  Figure it out.  It's a little  coroner's trick.  So tell me then.  What could I get  people to give that  you guys need the  most?  Squatch I'll get  back to you on and  I'll try and get down  to the supply place  figure out what's the  number one thing  they're looking for  and everything.  There just seems to  be so much of  everything right now  that they're storing  it in warehouses.  How about the  little doggy raincoats?  Yeah you know  little doggy raincoats 
[01:59:00]  you know what I mean.  I got little doggy  umbrellas.  How about the  little doggy tutus?  You ever see the  poodle walk around  with a tutu?  It's kind of cute.  Now let's talk  about the...  Hey you notice the  dog owners look like  the dogs?  You know they were  doing the booty  things for the dogs  that was like a big  thing.  That's a good thing  though you know  the poor little  poodle.  Yeah.  Scorch why don't you  take your nakedness  and go on a billboard  for a few days?  So how obnoxious is  that?  Try to get your name  in the paper like  you know Douglas is 
[01:59:30]  listening because they  pipe your show through  the station because  they want people to  know how radio should  sound.  But you know what I'm  saying though in all  honesty I'm listening to  this and it's like  that's there's a reason  he went from a very  hip place like Seattle  to a very unhip place  like Worcester.  Think about it.  You know it's  despicable about that  whole thing.  The whole thing.  You find out Schlocko  does some bit that he  stole the AF van and  went to a billboard  where he will remain  until they raise a  hundred and seven 
[02:00:00]  thousand dollars.  You know the money  great.  Bravo.  Hats off to raising  money.  Yeah no doubt.  But to then have to  handcuff to shackle  your good thing where  you're raising money  to a goofy radio  stunt where in a  situation like this you  can just hit the airwaves  and say hey we need  to raise money.  People are running  running over each  other to give money  to these causes.  God bless America. 
[02:00:30]  But to then try to  work in a way that  your name gets in the  paper like Schlocko  and Dave Dickless his  boss is doing is just  a despicable thing.  You want to do  something good for the  people and the  victims and the  rescuers.  Fine.  Raise some money.  But you know it's not  about you.  It's not about Schlocko  and Dave trying to get  their name in the  paper or their face  on TV.  Take some time out  man and just do it  for the good of 
[02:01:00]  doing it.  Not to get your face  in the paper.  You don't have to do  the wacky I'll be up  here on this billboard  until.  That's a great dopey  promotion if you're up  there until your  baseball team wins  and comes out of  their slump or you're  raising money for the  soccer team, the local  soccer team's uniform.  When you're doing  something where  thousands of people  died.  Because this is a  great deal.  Hold on.  You guys stay right  there.  Don't talk for a  second because I'm 
[02:01:30]  using too many  phone lines.  If this doesn't give  you a visual.  Kate from Boston.  Yes, Kate.  Hi.  Just giving you  guys an update.  There's nobody there.  Some AAF trucks.  That's about it.  So wait.  It says on the  screen Kate from  Boston just passed  Rocco on the  billboard.  Not one person at  parking lot.  That is the funniest  thing.  And that's what they  should do.  No doubt.  Give the money.  It's a good cause.  You know, I'm not  I'm never I'm never 
[02:02:00]  going to say that  it's not a good  cause.  But to then.  Hey Dave, I'm on  the billboard and no  one's showing up.  What should I do?  Hey Dave, what am I  going to do, man?  No one's showing up.  He's just saying he's  saying he's going to  be on only from six  till nine.  Oh, wow.  Way to put the  effort in.  That's a 69 joke.  Rocco.  This isn't to get him  any promotion and  blah, blah, blah.  We're like, whatever. 
[02:02:30]  Whatever.  He's just sitting there.  They got a big flag on  the billboard, which was  kind of cool, but that's  about it.  If it's not self-serving,  do it from your studio.  Yeah.  And don't don't don't do  some half-assed ancient  radio bit that Dave  Dickless came up with to  try to get some press  out of this.  This isn't about getting  press for your show  right now at this time.  It's about helping  people that need it.  Not getting press for  yourself and your  station.  Dave Dickless and  schlockhole. 
[02:03:00]  How humiliated do you  think he feels?  He's just on the  billboard by himself  and no one's showing up.  Dave, maybe this  wasn't a good idea.  Now what I do, I  committed to this.  Give the money.  I'm putting in a whole  three hours a day to  the cause.  I'll sit here and  promote giving money to  the cause.  But you know  something?  For him to then hit a  billboard, to be on a  billboard like a wacky  DJ.  Let me hear, here's  schlocko.  That's for you.  You know, to use an 
[02:03:30]  old radio gag.  And how did he  start it?  I stole the AF van.  No one knows I'm  doing this.  Yeah, like he didn't  sit in a meeting with  Dave Dickless and  figure out how you  could squeeze some  press out of this.  You're a disgrace.  It's despicable.  And we call for  complete humiliation.  Yeah, just completely  humiliate him.  Just try by and  openly laugh.  This has nothing to  do with taking away  from the cause at 
[02:04:00]  hand.  This is taking away  from him trying to  get press out of it.  This is self-serving.  It's self-serving.  All right.  Thank you, Kate.  You're welcome.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Not one person in the  parking lot.  Like, people have time  right now, and it's on  their mind to go see  Rocco on a billboard.  Jesus Christ on the  cross.  What the hell is that?  I'm losing my mind.  Dave is like that.  He is that kind of a 
[02:04:30]  person, though.  You know what I mean?  More Midwest radio  for Dave Dickless.  He seriously is just  one of those people.  You can just tell he  doesn't really, and I'm  not, you know what,  whatever, just like you  said, the whole cause,  great cause, the whole  thing, but it sounds  like we, truthfully, it  sounds like we all have  sour grace, but you know  what, think about it.  This is just the kind of  person he is.  And he was probably  looking up in the sky,  probably looking up in the  sky saying, hmm, this is  probably not that bad of a  thing to do.  If I could get some press  out of it, it would be great.  And do you know 
[02:05:00]  something, after we got  on the air up there in  Boston, and just exposed  all the phoniness and  insincerity that that  show and that station's  all about, you would  think they would pull  back and not do  something so blatantly  fake and just hokey and  self-serving during a time  like this, and what do  they do?  I guess it's just they  don't know how to do  anything different than  that, but it seems like  right now is not the time  to think about getting  your afternoon jock's 
[02:05:30]  face in the paper or  on the news.  It's about helping  people, and then to  shackle it along with a  self-serving thing like  putting your jock up on  a billboard is just  despicable.  Imagine what the  headline could be like,  you know, normally dirt  jock an afternoon does  very nice thing and sat  in studio and raised  this amount of money.  He should have like  gone on a hunger  strike and donated his  food that he'd eat for  a week to the guys.  How about that?  Hey, think about that.  You know, but we  don't have something.  Anyway, guys, seriously, 
[02:06:00]  I just want to say  thanks to her.  All right, good luck  with collecting dog food.  Yeah, good luck with  everything down there.  And let me, seriously,  guys, call me and let  me know what I can get  people to bring down  there.  All right.  Yeah, I like you.  Cool, thanks,  George.  Peace, guys.  All right.  Peace out.  Totally nude radio.  Totally nude.  Let me tell you  something, security not a  problem at the  kingdom of nakedness.  Everyone's nude.  They can't hide  nothing.  Totally nude, totally  secure, and the  kingdom of nakedness  totally nude.  We're all nude.  We're all nude.  Nude all the time.  If someone's packing a 
[02:06:30]  knife, I'd hate to hear  where he's got it.  Totally nude.  Totally nude.  Need something for the  doggies.  I love that guy, man.  Scorch is a pisser.  Guys, I'm going to be  collecting cupcakes on  Friday.  Try to get Yankee hats  for goldfish.  Please share.  You know, there's  goldfish swimming in  their fishing balls,  in their little fish  balls, and they don't  have Yankee hats.  Have you seen a goldfish  with a Yankee cap? 
[02:07:00]  No, they want them.  How do you know they  don't want them?  They always give you  that look through the  side of the bowl like,  hey, I could use a  Yankee cap.  Totally nude.  Totally nude.  And, you know, I like  goldfish because you  look at the bowl, they  are totally nude.  I've never seen them  wear clothes like me  in the kingdom of  nakedness.  Nudity.  Fish, always nude.  Good.  Is he really naked on  a show?  I don't care if he is  or he isn't.  It sounds great.  It's a bit.  What a party when  you're nude.  Another one of those 
[02:07:30]  radio bits.  Totally nude.  We love the guy.  We're trying to get  him out of the way he  does his radio show.  He's a start alert.  Yeah, he is.  Oh, with you mocking  him at every turn, he's  going to have no  choice, Opie.  He is a blast, though.  All right.  Dan from Hoboken  wants in.  Hey, Dan.  Hey, what's up, guys?  One part of the Rocco  thing is that the  crane they had to use  to get him up on a  billboard could have  been used for the  release effort.  Right.  Very good.  I just want to do a  comment on when Opie  said that the 18 to  34-year-olds out there  aren't really doing 
[02:08:00]  much or being heard  that much.  Wait, wait, Dan.  Dan.  No, that's not  really what I said.  Oh, no.  What I said was that  I'm just not hearing a  lot from you guys.  That's all.  Well, I admit, you  know, our generation  just has been pretty  spoiled up until now.  I mean, we didn't know  what terror was or  what horrific, you  know, we didn't have  anything like this.  So, you know, it's  taken some time to  try to figure out  what to do.  But I think that,  you know, concerning  hundreds of thousands  of 18 to 34-year-olds  right now are  trying to go to war,  I think, you know.  Yeah.  They're pulling their  load.  Well, we just know we 
[02:08:30]  have a lot of you guys  listening, and we haven't  heard much from you guys.  That's all.  I just wonder what  you're feeling.  I don't know.  I don't know how a  20-year-old feels.  Let me ask you  something, or actually  just make a little  statement.  For years, you have  heard about Generation  X, the younger  generation.  And let me tell you  something.  Their biggest complaint  has been, and I'm  not going to sit here  like, I'll tell you  kids something.  I walked back and  forth to school,  a pill in the  snow both ways.  But the biggest  complaint, if you  watch any of these  shows that they 
[02:09:00]  plaster in front of  you on MTV, is,  look, dude, we  never had the cause.  You know, you had  the generations  before, you had the  World War II, the  Vietnam, this.  You know, we're  angry, we don't have  a cause, we don't  have the...  Yeah.  Here's your cause.  Oh, I think it's  right now.  Here it is.  Welcome to a cause.  I mean, everybody's  18-year-olds who are  going to join the  fire department now.  I mean, I think  everybody's growing up  and growing up fast  right now.  You know, people  that sat back  thinking, you know,  we didn't have 
[02:09:30]  anything, a cause to  rally behind or  something, you should  have been counting  your blessings that  you didn't have a  cause.  Because now...  I wish it was a  week ago today.  I mean, it's  ridiculous.  Now here's your  cause.  Well, we'll try to  make you guys proud,  you old folks.  Thank you, Dan,  Don.  All right, Dan,  thank you.  Talk to you guys  later.  We definitely want to  hear from more of  you guys, without a  doubt, as the days  and weeks go on  here.  Sean, what's up?  Howdy.  Hey.  Baggots.  Baggots.  I understand that 
[02:10:00]  one of the three  finalists on Big  Brother has either a  best friend or a  relative missing in  the tower.  They have no  freaking idea.  That would be a  cousin, Monica's  cousin.  Oh, okay, yeah.  And I guess they  haven't told them  much.  They know something  happened, but they  don't know how to  care about your  stupid TV show.  Absolutely.  A complete disaster  has hit America,  and there's three  people in a house  somewhere in L.A.,  and one knows a  little bit, and the  other two don't know  much of anything.  They don't know what  happened in New York?  No.  Well, they told, I was 
[02:10:30]  reading about this  today, and I guess  they told Monica,  because her cousin is  missing, they told  her a little bit.  They wouldn't break  the rules of the  show?  No.  Hey, the show's  important.  That's terrible.  Guys, one other  point.  I drive up and  down a turnpike  every day since the  bombing, or since  the crash, or  whatever.  Yeah.  I'm watching fellow  drivers.  We're watching the  planes in the sky, and  we're following them  everywhere.  I mean, normally you  look up in the air, you  see the plane, you go  back to the road.  Yeah, you don't  care.  People are turning 
[02:11:00]  their heads, watching  where these planes are  going, and then they  continue on their way.  Yeah, you're not  taking your eyes off the  planes over Manhattan  these days.  You guys still suck.  All right, Sean,  thanks.  All right.  Bye.  That is disgraceful,  because the show  has to go on.  Yeah, you don't  want to interfere with  the plot line of the  show.  Right.  All right.  Hey, Curtis.  All right.  What's up?  I ain't doing real  good. 
[02:11:30]  I've been holding it in  for about a week.  I was sitting there on  the ground when I seen  this.  I heard about the  first one.  I went outside, I was  watching it, and the  second one hit.  And, you know, I've been  holding it in for a  while.  I got a little girl down  in Texas, and, you  know, for about a week  I've been holding it,  and then today, you  bastard play Metallica,  get me all wound up.  Yeah.  And then I get all 
[02:12:00]  wound up.  Goddamn.  Then Opie starts  making jokes, so I  start laughing.  I don't know what to  feel anymore.  What jokes?  The Ed jokes, or  was Ed?  Every day, I think.  Opie's funny.  Every goddamn thing.  I mean, you know,  and Anthony, I'm  sorry.  Yeah, I think it's  Anthony.  It's the whole  goddamn show.  We're all a big  party going on here.  We're all for one,  one for all.  Yeah.  I mean, I just, what  I'm so pissed about is,  I mean, I'm sitting  there watching on TV  right now.  Right, on the TV.  You see pain and pain  and pain and pain and  pain and pain and  pain, and we have 
[02:12:30]  nothing.  We have done nothing.  We know who did it.  Go get him.  He's right over there.  Well, goddamn, go  get him.  Go get him.  I just want to make  this perfectly clear.  We live in the same  country, you and I,  right?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  I'm from Texas.  Go ahead and make  fun.  Goddamn, no, I love  Texas.  You go to L.A.  They talk a little  differently.  You know, you go up  to Boston a little  differently.  Man, Texas, you got  your own thing going  on down there.  That's the problem.  These Arabs, they see  that Americans are  soft and weak, they  think, but they didn't  see these lunatics 
[02:13:00]  down south.  We're going to go  get you, boy, and  they will.  Go get him.  Those are the guys  you want to deal  with.  Oh, yeah.  Is it true that your  boys down there didn't  execute someone because  of the tragedy?  I don't know.  Like I say, I live up  here now.  Some guy was supposed  to be put to death  down in Texas, another  one of those stories  that have come out  because of the tragedy.  They put off an  execution in Texas?  They put off an  execution in Texas.  Wow.  They carry a lot of  things in their own  hands.  I'm from the same  town where they did  the Black Dragon, where 
[02:13:30]  they drugged the black  guys.  Right.  Wow, that's a proud  thing to say you're  from that town.  Jesus.  Well, I mean, I'm  proud of it.  I live up here, and I've  lived up here for two  and a half years now.  Yeah.  And, uh, but, uh, it's,  it's, I just got tired  of the rednecks.  I can't lose the  accent, but, uh, you  know, my brothers have  lived up here about 10  years, and, and I went  through a bad divorce, so  I moved up here, and I  got a little girl down  in Texas.  I just flew her back  about three weeks ago.  Got a little girl down  there in Texas, huh? 
[02:14:00]  You just threw her  back.  She's two.  Flew her back, Opie.  What the hell's wrong  with you?  I flew her back, and I've  seen on the news the  other night, another  thing I've been holding  in is I see a little  girl, shows a picture  of, uh, a mom and her  little girl, and I've  been having nightmares  thinking, you know,  what the hell would I do  if my daughter, first  thing I would want to do  is just protect my own  daughter, and then, but  I couldn't let them, uh,  you know, hijackers and  everything come in there  and just take off the 
[02:14:30]  plane so you'd be torn.  You don't know what to  do.  Take care of your own.  I mean, you don't know  you're going to be  crashing into a building  in 30, you know, 30  minutes or so.  Yeah.  All right, Curtis.  All right, man.  Thanks, man.  Hang in there, all right?  All right, man.  Bye.  The blind albino checking  in.  He just goes, the black  dragon?  He's, like, freaking  out.  Because the guy goes,  down there, the black  dragon?  Down there where they  had the black dragon?  The black guy that was  dragged with the truck. 
[02:15:00]  You just call it the  black dragon.  The black dragon.  Oh, my God.  I thought he was  talking about some  special forces or  something.  It's another world down  there.  All right.  You know the deal.  We'll do this and then  we'll do that and we'll  be back.  More commercials about  your penis.  Oh, thank God.  Thank God.  In this tragedy, we can  add an extra inch or  two on your schlong.  How does that work?  Does anybody know?  Oh, who knows?  It's embarrassing. 
[02:15:30]  We're going through all  this crap and sadness  and then you listen to  some of these commercials.  Hey, let's make your  schlong longer.  For every inch you put  on your schlong, we'll  donate.  I actually turned down  some copy today.  Executive turndown.  I saw you do that.  I walked into Ken  Stevens' office.  I was mighty proud of  you.  I had some copy and I  didn't think it was  appropriate.  You got away from your  video game to deal with  show matters.  I did.  For two seconds.  I know.  And then I ran right  back to it again.  Playing Tropico.  It's pretty cool.  But yeah, there was some 
[02:16:00]  stuff in there that  seemed like the sponsor  was getting a little  overzealous and thinking  maybe they should  incorporate how good  they are in the light  of this tragedy and how  much they're helping.  And it was a little too  self-serving, if you  ask me, in the copy.  So I was just like,  you know, I'm not  comfortable reading this.  And they fixed it.  Ken, damn it.  Ken personally fixed it.  We wrote the copy.  Katie.  Or Kaylee.  Kaylee.  Yes.  Kaylee.  You're on the radio. 
[02:16:30]  I hear us in the  background.  That's a delay.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, baby.  What I'm thinking is  everybody needs,  everybody has everything  that they need.  Down at the ground zero?  Exactly.  The little doggies  got everything they need.  You know, dogs are nude.  Even though they got fur,  that's considered nude.  Totally nude.  That's why I like dogs.  Chicken, chicken, nakedness.  Totally nude dogs.  Totally nude dogs.  I think that everybody 
[02:17:00]  needs a little stress relief.  Yeah.  And I am definitely  willing to come down  and offer myself  as some stress relief.  Whoa.  You mean like  some kind of services?  Oh, yeah.  Of the sexual type?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Now, this is something  I haven't heard anyone  ask for in the media yet.  Well...  You know, they should.  I've been very stressed.  Would you be willing  to come down to the studio  and perform oral treats? 
[02:17:30]  I most certainly would.  And that would not mean  that I am a loose girl.  No, no, no.  That just means  that I'm a fun girl.  You're a patriot.  You're a patriot.  For the cause.  All right, why don't we  put the word out?  We're looking for whores.  We're looking for whores.  Where do you live, miss?  The more, the better.  I think Cleveland.  Oh, that doesn't help.  Kaylee, are you hot?  Oh, yeah.  And you just want guys  to bang you down there?  I'm trying to understand.  Cleveland.  I have nothing to offer  because everybody else  has already offered help  and I've donated blood 
[02:18:00]  and money  and so I think  that people need stress relief  so the only thing left to do  is donate myself.  She's offering the warm, wet spot.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  You're a good girl.  I like that area.  How many...  Guys, can you take care of,  you think?  Oh, my goodness.  I don't know.  That would depend.  Hmm.  I guess I just have to be  put in that situation.  Well, you're not going down there  just to take care of one guy.  Well, no.  They all need help.  Everybody needs a little loving.  Wow. 
[02:18:30]  You're not fat, are you?  No, I'm not.  I'm very cute.  Oof.  Nice.  I hate to see what that looks like  after the whole time.  Oh, my God.  The firemen,  I think they're used to using  that foam during aviation fire.  You definitely wouldn't want  to see that between her thighs.  What's going to look worse,  Afghanistan after we bomb it  or Kaylee's patch  after we send her down  to Ground Zero?  Oh, my.  Ouch.  Nasty.  All right, Kaylee. 
[02:19:00]  Hold on.  All right.  There goes Kaylee  out of her effing mind.  People out of their effing minds today.  After they're done with it,  it'll be all red, white,  black, and blue.  She's offering her body, eh?  You know something?  All right.  It's a wonderful country.  We're in.  That made me hurt.  I've heard it all.  Opie.  I'm the sweetheart.  And Anthony.  That's the A-hole over there.  You C-sucking F.  Cool jack-off ass F.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, that's funny.  Hey, thanks for checking us out.  It's the O&A Show.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, first of all,  I just want to say  you guys are doing a great job.  I look forward to listening  to your show every day  just because it gets me away  from that.  Not that the news is boring,  but it just kind of  makes me laugh a bit.  But anyway, I'm pretty great.  You know what?  We're just trying to  relieve some tension. 
[02:20:00]  We'll never forget,  but we think people need  just a slight distraction  before they go back  to the TV, you know?  Absolutely.  And that's what we're  trying to do.  Absolutely.  But I'm in my early 20s,  you know?  And I think, obviously,  I think just like everybody  else in the United States,  this is horrible.  But I think also,  and some things I guess  a lot of people  might actually don't think about,  if this is going to be  a long-term thing,  which they say it is,  we have to start thinking  about being drafted  and things like that.  I mean, my buddies and I,  we'd be like prime candidates  for that. 
[02:20:30]  I think a lot of people  don't think about that.  And since we haven't been  through like a real big tragedy,  you know,  and my age group,  I mean, it's something  we need to think about  seriously, you know?  Yeah.  But anyway,  I think you guys  are doing a great job  and I just want to thank you.  All right.  Thanks, Bill.  All right, man.  Take care.  Bye.  Hope you check this out.  From Employment Weekly,  there's an ad  for airport security screeners.  Positions available  at Newark International Airport. 
[02:21:00]  We offer $6.50 an hour  to start  with step increases  to $6.85 an hour.  Paid training,  uniforms,  holiday and vacations.  High school diploma,  GED accepted.  Good enough diploma.  10-year background check.  Fingerprinting  and drug testing required.  Seniors encouraged  to apply.  That's $6.50 an hour.  Security guy.  What's the problem 
[02:21:30]  with airport screening?  There's not enough elderly.  Seniors.  Okay, step through, please, sir.  What's your name?  Akhnad.  Nice to meet you, sir.  No, you don't.  I don't have to check that bag.  Go right along.  You look like  a fine young whippersnapper.  Shouldn't we just have, like,  I don't know,  highly trained professionals?  That would be a good idea  at this point.  I don't want anybody  working in an airport  who is prone to go  to the bathroom  in their own pants.  Right.  Good rule of thumb. 
[02:22:00]  Good rule of thumb  to follow.  Thank you, Norton.  Barry.  Hi, how you doing?  All right.  I just want to say  that I really appreciated  last week  how you dedicated  the whole show  to this crisis.  No choice.  You're talking about  stupid T-shirts,  like you saw this lady  wearing a  Terror at the Towers  T-shirt.  Yeah, but that was  from 93, so it's okay.  Someone told us that.  Okay, well,  I saw a T-shirt  that really pissed me off.  It was a shirt  that said  Attack on America 
[02:22:30]  with a picture  of the Towers  and it said  I'm so glad  I made it out.  Now, I'm trying  to decide  Spit, are you kidding me?  I'm not kidding  and I saw it twice.  I saw it on 6th Avenue  at 15th Street  and I saw it  in the Manhattan Mall.  Spit in their face.  I'm so glad  I made it out.  Did you see people  wearing these?  No, I can't imagine  anyone buying it  and I was horrified  someone was selling it.  So, you know what I mean?  It's like,  hey, I'm bragging 
[02:23:00]  I lived  when everyone around me  knows somebody  that died.  Yeah.  It reminded me of  I survived  the Rolling Thunder  roller coaster  at Six Flags.  It was disgusting.  I was horrified.  I mean,  on top of  all the stress  that everybody's  been going through  we need to  deal with this  new dimension  of ignorance.  How about this one?  My dad survived  the World Trade Center  disaster  and all I got  was this t-shirt.  Yeah, why not?  Do you actually see that?  You watch.  Yeah, I'm sure  it'll pop up.  I was just down 
[02:23:30]  at the scene today  where I was about  20 feet from the debris  because I work  for the police department  and I'm still shaking  just from seeing everything.  Yeah.  I can't stop shaking  and, you know,  to see stuff like that  it just really kills me  and I just want to say  I was not a former  O&A fan  because my boyfriend  actually knows  your Warrior bus  very well.  Oh, good.  If you know  who I'm talking about.  Was he on the bus?  No, he was in front of it  and took the blame  for the whole thing. 
[02:24:00]  That's my honey bun.  Anyways,  I'm not a former  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Is he okay?  Yeah, he's okay.  Does he still have his job?  He is doing  God's work right now.  He is working  at the morgue  doing  vouchering property.  All right, thank God.  I know exactly who he is.  He is a wonderful guy.  He has a heart of gold.  He is doing  the work of God  right now  and I was not  a former O&A fan  because...  Tell him we said hi.  I know exactly  what you're talking about.  And he's been trying  to get in touch 
[02:24:30]  with you guys.  You know,  he is doing  very important work  right now  because a lot  of these people  won't have  a grave site to visit  and their only resolve  might be getting  a wedding band  back from their loved one  and I'm so proud of him  for being so strong  and doing this  important work  that he's doing.  I was not  a former O&A fan  because I was very upset  when that whole incident  broke out.  All the media  made it sound  ten times worse  than it was  but when I listened  to your show  I said to him 
[02:25:00]  I gained so much  respect for them  for not playing  the stupid music  like they said  all these other  radio stations  are playing  and that O&A  were all they  wanted to do  is have people  call in  and get stuff  off their minds.  Yeah, yeah.  We're just trying  to keep it real.  I have so much  respect for you both  and...  Well, tell your boyfriend  we said hi.  I know exactly who he is  and I'm glad  everything worked out  for you.  Yeah, he's doing  God's work right now  and that's all  he wants to do  is help people.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, I mean 
[02:25:30]  come on.  That shirt  is a great dream.  Stop buying the T-shirt  stop buying the pictures  of the Twin Towers  and Gulf of Plains.  Who's out there  selling this stuff?  A lot of the street vendors  I'm telling you.  I've seen more and more of it.  Scum, scum.  You're dealing in death.  What's next?  Co-ed naked  attack survival?  Of course.  You know what?  Elsa,  the mayor  brought this up earlier.  People are calling  homes  and soliciting money.  They're asking people  for their credit card number  to donate  to charities 
[02:26:00]  that don't exist.  A legitimate charity  will not call your house.  So if someone calls you  saying that we're  with a certain organization  and they want you  to send money  and give their credit card,  it's fake.  So don't  be stupid enough  to give your credit card  to these people.  And the people  that do that,  it's just amazing  that no matter  how bad  a tragedy,  some vulture,  some shyster  is always going  to be there  to try to squeeze  a buck out of it.  And there should be 
[02:26:30]  a death penalty  for that.  Scum.  They're going after  the elderly  with a lot of those  scams too.  Anthony,  I want to read  an email from  one of our listeners,  Andy.  We're getting a lot  of these  and I just don't  know what to do with it.  Maybe we could put  these on websites  or something.  I don't know.  But I just want  to read this one,  okay?  It's from Andy.  My father was on  floor 104  in Trade Center  building number two.  He was a huge  Opie and Anthony fan.  He loved you guys 
[02:27:00]  and got me into you too.  I'm only 15  and a teenager  and his...  I'm only 15,  okay,  and a teenager  and his dad  don't have much  in common,  but we have  the O&A show.  I called it  every once in a while.  He never did  because he was at work,  but he still listened  almost every day.  When he didn't listen,  we would have nothing  to talk about at dinner  and I'd get pissed.  Your show  over the past few days  has been great.  You truly are,  whether you like it  or not,  decent human beings.  I've had a lot of S  going on with my family  and all, 
[02:27:30]  but I still get  five minutes of the show  here and there.  My mom,  who obviously is in mourning,  has said that she is  taking comfort  in listening to you guys.  She was never  the biggest fan  and she would often  roll her eyes  at stuff me  and my dad  would talk about,  especially when she  found out  with the sticker  that we put  in the back window  of his car mat.  I just want to say  thanks and next time  I get a chance to call,  I will.  It's just been tough  because life is  so different now,  but I want to say  that you two guys  brought joy to my dad  who was battling  depression for the  past few years.  I knew that from  three to seven  he was having 
[02:28:00]  a good time.  You guys are great  and I will call you  soon.  Andy.  Wow.  Oof.  We've had a bunch  of these come in.  Pepper.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hi guys.  What's up?  Hey listen,  I will forgive you  for leaving me on hold  my entire lunch break  because now I have  to go back to work.  If you can find  this truck for me  and find out  where it's going,  on the back  of this truck  it was,  when I got off  work at five,  it was at the  corner of 45th 
[02:28:30]  and 8th Avenue,  between 8th and 9th Avenue,  going somewhere  and on the back  of this truck  was a bronze statue  of a fireman.  It just,  it made me cry.  The fireman is  on one knee  with his face  in his hand  and he's,  you could see his face  and he was so sad  and he had a,  got pack on his back  and everything  and he was just like  kneeling down mourning  and there was also  two bronze plaques  on that truck  and they're obviously  going to be put  somewhere in memorial  for the fireman  but it was just, 
[02:29:00]  I could hardly even  get my camera out  to take a picture of it  because it was just  so sad  I just started to cry  and I don't want  to be sad anymore.  I know,  I know,  you guys have been  really,  I don't know what  I would do  without you guys  to make me laugh  the past couple of months.  My life has been  in a total effort.  Pepper,  I'm assuming that  a picture of the statue  will be in the paper soon  and I just got to know  where it's going to be.  My dad's a fireman,  my brother's a fireman,  my sister-in-law's  a firefighter,  my sister is a  firefighter slash EMT, 
[02:29:30]  everybody in my family  fights,  you know,  is a public servant.  Before my mom died,  she was a 911 operator.  Everybody in my family,  you know,  except me,  but I might lose my job.  If you listen to the post,  if you read,  and the stupid post,  because I work on Broadway  and I'm going to lose  my job this week,  but man,  I just got to know  where that statue is.  All right, Pepper,  we'll find out  and we'll pass it along  to you, okay?  That'd be great. 
[02:30:00]  I'd love it.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for everything  you've done, too.  I think Jim has something.  Pepper?  Yeah.  Do you have large breasts?  40 Ds.  Nice.  There we go.  That guy sucks.  Puts it in perspective,  doesn't it?  40 means baby's got back.  Good.  I like that.  Healthy girl.  Thank you, Pepper.  Thanks, Pepper.  Okay.  Yeah, good butter churning hips.  Brian, what's going on?  How you doing, boys?  All right.  Listen, I'm an x-ray tech, 
[02:30:30]  licensed x-ray tech.  We make like $20-something  an hour and nothing moves.  I mean, we actually see  the x-ray in front of us  and sometimes we can't  even decipher what certain  objects they have  in their pockets are  if they remove  their clothing properly.  So I don't understand  how a person making  $6 an hour can have  the conveyor belt going  non-stop.  Well, I'm sure it's not  the $6.50 an hour  people that are watching  the monitors.  And to their credit,  I know some of those machines, 
[02:31:00]  certain explosives show up  as a different color.  You know what I mean?  They're more than just  x-ray machines.  They can tell what certain  things are made out of.  But that doesn't stop  the knife from getting through  or other metal objects.  You can't take some C4 with you  because it'll show up  a different color  and you can just take  a glance at the x-ray  and know that there's  C4 in there.  But, yeah, but knives  or something,  they don't look close enough  to tell if there's  something like that 
[02:31:30]  in someone's carry-on.  All right.  The bronze statue,  we're being told,  may be in Union Square  Park right now.  It has a bronze flag, too.  It has a bronze flag, too.  Well, they had one last time.  Oh, they have a bronze  American flag down there?  Yeah.  Ben's been checking out  Union Square Park.  They have a huge bronze flag,  so that would make  total sense.  It's in a spot  that it could be a statue,  so someone said that,  so that kind of makes sense.  All right.  Yeah, it's a pretty crazy  scene down there every night.  All right, can we play  What Did We Learn  on the O&A show today?  Someone said, 
[02:32:00]  What Did I Learn?  Much Too Much About Ants.  Mike from PA, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to comment  on the T-shirts  you guys were talking about.  Yeah.  My uncle works for a car dealership  in Langhorne, PA,  and they're selling a shirt  throughout its work.  It has a picture  of the World Trade Center  buildings on it,  and they're on fire,  and there's a big American flag  coming out of the front of them,  and at the bottom,  it says,  Now, it's our turn to kick ass.  Yeah.  The only problem is  they're selling the shirts 
[02:32:30]  for $12 a piece.  They're only donating $2  in that $12.  Awful.  Any T-shirt.  Awful.  I don't care if they  donate 100%.  You should not have T-shirts  of the towers on it  in flames  or any other way.  It's just,  it doesn't seem right to me.  It's hard to believe, though,  that a used car salesman  is unscrupulous.  I know.  Right?  Yeah.  Usually, they're  some of the most  honest people out there.  Right.  Yeah.  Trustworthy.  Honest.  Is he selling  JonBenet Ramsey's  panties on eBay? 
[02:33:00]  No, no.  I can text for it.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for the chuckles.  Thanks for the chuckles today, guys.  I greatly appreciate  the comedy today.  All right, let's start  with some  what-do-we-learns.  Let's start with Joe.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I actually learned  a lot today.  Yeah?  Did you?  First of all,  I learned obesity  is very funny.  Godiva makes it all okay.  History has taught us  that women get PMS.  And I've got to show  this visual I got 
[02:33:30]  when you were doing  the voice of Patty.  I got a three-inch tall  ant with Geddy Lee's  head on it.  It was the greatest thing ever.  I'm in a hand.  Yeah.  Redemption's mine, stinky.  All right.  Later.  Thank you.  Bye.  That's funny.  Brian from Jersey.  Yes, we all learned  this one.  What did I learn?  I learned the Black Dragon  is not a Texas militia.  Or a Chinese restaurant.  Or a Chinese restaurant.  That's what I heard. 
[02:34:00]  Welcome to the Black Dragon.  Would you like some  Amukukaipan?  Joe from Hoboken.  I learned that you guys  got fired from AAF  in Boston  for saying the mayor  of Boston died,  but it's okay  for your replacement  to base a promotional stunt  off of the death  of 5,500 people.  Yeah.  There you go.  A wacky stunt.  This isn't the time  for radio stunts.  For radio stunts  to try to get publicity  for yourself  and your station.  You want to raise money?  Fine.  Do it.  You don't have to  attach yourself to it 
[02:34:30]  with the hopes  that your mug  will be on the news  or on the paper.  You know...  Dave Dickless's name.  You know what I'm going  to do for tomorrow?  You know what I'm going  to do for tomorrow?  You should see  what some of the radio stations  across America  are doing.  Yeah.  In honor of this tragedy.  Mm-hmm.  It's an embarrassment.  We should try to scrape up  some of the stuff.  No, I already...  I got it.  We got it.  I got it.  I'll bring it all in.  All right.  Let's bring it  because, you know,  he's not alone  in the disgrace.  This whole business  is full of just whores 
[02:35:00]  that want their names  and faces splashed  on the paper and TV.  And you know something?  I won't put it past us.  We love when that happens.  We love the exposure.  But now,  it ain't about us.  It's not about this show  and us.  It's about trying  to get through this time.  We're not worried  about a news crew  saying the Opie and Anthony show  and putting our faces on  or getting our faces  in a newspaper 
[02:35:30]  and to have a promotion  that on one hand  is trying to raise money,  but on the other,  you just know  they're trying to get  the publicity  for their show  to try to get ratings.  It's a disgrace.  I'm sorry.  That's how I see it.  Embarrassment.  Speaking of which,  Whip Him Out Wednesday  will not be happening tomorrow.  No.  How do you do stuff like that?  I mean,  if ladies, you know,  want to do it to relief,  whatever.  Whatever.  Do what you want,  but we're not going to be 
[02:36:00]  openly promoting that  for a while.  Yeah.  It just doesn't feel right.  Right.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  Norton,  I learned I can catch  Marlon Brando  with a billboard in Boston.  Hey, I got an obscure reference  that can relate to that.  Yeah.  Do you remember the show  called Perfect Strangers?  I remember the name  and not the show.  Yeah, Balky, this tool,  and his cousin Larry  was a bigger tool.  There was this episode  where they would stay  up on a billboard  until the Chicago Bulls  won a game.  The show was... 
[02:36:30]  Hey, Cousin Larry.  Just stay up on the billboard,  Cousin Larry.  Of course not.  Don't be ridiculous.  Don't be ridiculous.  Yeah, that was his catchphrase.  Boy, you know,  when you're stealing  radio bits  from the likes of  Balky and Cousin Larry  from Perfect Strangers,  ugh, awful, awful,  you stink, awful.  That's nice.  Hey, thanks for helping  us heal last week, okay?  All right, Joe.  Later.  Heal.  We don't even have a scab yet. 
[02:37:00]  Uncle John.  Hey, guys, how are you?  Hey.  I learned a plethora of things.  And if Anthony can use  a poignant,  I can use plethora.  There you go.  I learned that goldfish  are always naked.  Totally nude.  I learned that there's  a black dragon in Texas,  and I'm wondering  if he's related  to our giant mosquito.  I've heard that there's  a product that'll  make my penis  31% larger.  And that's about it.  You guys suck,  and Norton,  you just nibbled.  Take care, guys.  All right, Uncle John.  Thanks.  Tom, I learned the  cough button acts  as Norton's conscience.  That's good, man. 
[02:37:30]  I learned you need  to ask for the keys  to steal the van.  It was good.  I wonder if there'll be  a fake suspension  in his future for that.  Hey, I stole the vans,  and I'm going to be suspended.  Blind from Bay Ridge.  What I learned today,  going on a billboard  using a tragedy  for your own personal gain  is never cool,  but throwing eggs  at a fat man is.  We're looking for  total humiliation, Boston.  Total humiliation. 
[02:38:00]  Jerry from Jersey.  I learned,  even with Marlon Brando,  billboard bits  always stink.  Lord Comeover's  not so bad after all.  Waiting to retaliate  is like a two-hour lap dance.  Convicts make  the best ground troops,  and Patty's saving herself  for an army ant.  Yeah, that's true.  Scott writes,  today I learned  dogs are nude  even though they have fur.  Later, tools.  All right,  that's good enough, right? 
[02:38:30]  I learned people  are losing their effing minds today,  and 5,000 miles to an ant,  two inches to a human.  Oh, look at that.  Some nice math.  Corey.  Hey.  Hey.  What I learned today,  I learned that  there's something quite like  an ass-kicking Metallica song  to remind me  that what this is all about anyway,  and we shouldn't all be sad.  We should be ready  to kick some ass.  Yeah.  Very good.  We're working on  like a soundtrack here  for the effort.  We got like some Motley Crue,  Knock Em Dead Kid.  We got some Peace of Me 
[02:39:00]  by Skid Row.  We're not going to take it,  Twisted Sister.  Those are the tunes  that stations need to be  playing there.  All the updated stuff.  Well, I don't think  it's time to break out  the total 80s catalog,  my friend.  Every soldier should have  a mullet.  It's not a mullet  than a big load of eyeliner  in his battalion belt there.  Where can Cinderella  fit in to this whole  musical montage?  Eh.  What can he do, you know?  Hey, thanks a lot, guys.  Take it easy, brother.  All right.  Man.  Yeah, we got to go.  Every bad boy 
[02:39:30]  has his soft side.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  All right, man.  I hope this is doing  some good.  We really don't know  what to do with this show.  Hopefully, it just  relieves some tension  for a little while.  It's just a little bit  of a distraction.  That's what it's always  been about.  Just melding into  the psyche of this city  and the country.  I'm going home to watch  another five hours of coverage.  I'm playing Tropico.  Are you?  Yeah, it's a cool game, man.  I'm in charge of a little island  and I'm like a dictator 
[02:40:00]  and I got to screw  with my peeps.  Well, maybe we can talk  about that tomorrow.  Yeah.  Don't ever forget.  Thanks, Norton.  Thank you.  See you tomorrow.  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks  in the world  of unlimited halibut.  A four-hour parade of meat. </pre>
