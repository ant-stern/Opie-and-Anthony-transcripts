<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a significant portion dedicated to Erock's tardiness.  His explanation involved a night of excessive drinking and substance use at a concert featuring Kid Rock, Reverend Run, and Leonard Skinner, necessitating his involvement in getting his intoxicated group home safely.  Sam, a staff member, provided amusing "spy reports" via text message, and Pat Duffy conducted an on-air breathalyzer test on Erock.  This segment was filled with teasing and speculation about Erock’s night.

The show then shifted to Anthony Cumia's developing relationship with Jill Nicolini, a traffic reporter.  The revelation began with a message Jill sent to Mick Foley (a previous day's guest), followed by an on-air phone call where they discussed a potential date.  Jill's subsequent live traffic reports included coded messages for Anthony – a hair flip, nose scratch, wink, and the phrase "okay terrific" – all analyzed extensively by the hosts and callers.  Bill Shatner offered unsolicited dating advice, adding to the chaotic and often profane atmosphere.  The hosts and callers engaged in numerous sexually suggestive and crude jokes about Anthony and Jill's potential future, including numerous predictions about the number of children they might have.

Next, the show featured listener calls reacting to news items, including George W. Bush's visit to Israel and perceived slight against Barack Obama, Keith Olbermann's criticism of Bush, and commentary on Rachel Maddow's appearance.

A lengthy in-studio interview with comedian Greg Giraldo followed.  Giraldo discussed his struggles with substance abuse, sharing humorous and disturbing anecdotes of paranoia and erratic behavior stemming from his addiction. He also spoke about the unique pressures faced by comedians.  This segment also included a "FU Line" of vulgar listener voicemails.

The show continued with a discussion about sobriety in the stand-up comedy world, followed by a bizarre news story about a 90-year-old woman found dead on a toilet, whose family allegedly attempted a months-long resurrection through prayer, leading to speculation of potential social security fraud.  This was followed by a further update on the Anthony/Jill romance, including a TMZ-style report read on-air, and audio of a woman kicking a man in the testicles during a previous "walk-over" segment.

John Cena then joined the show.  Discussions included his wrestling career, the film "12 Rounds," fan interactions, a Gillette contest promotion, and a humorous anecdote about a bet involving defecation.  Listener calls were taken, including one requesting Cena's help with disciplining a child.  The segment included discussions of Cena's rap album "Word Life," a brief appearance by Prime Time Sam Roberts discussing a wrestling match, and the studio audience's reaction to Cena's entourage.  Cena also discussed his rivalry with The Rock, internet criticism, his work with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, steroid use in wrestling, and his physique.

Following Cena, Greg Giraldo returned, recounting a violent anecdote about boxing a 12-year-old on a film set and promoting his upcoming shows.  The bulk of the remaining segment focused on a sexually charged interaction with Jane, a self-described fan of Jimmy Norton (who was also in studio).  The conversation included explicit discussions of sex, Jane's relationship with Nick Carter (including mentions of texts and messages), and culminated in Jane allowing Pat Duffy and Jimmy Norton to smell her buttocks, with explicit commentary. E-Rock's involvement in Jane’s invitation to the studio was discussed, along with details of their MySpace communications.  The hosts and listeners extensively teased and riffed on the situation. The segment concluded with microphone technical difficulties.

[00:02:00]  tri-state uh tri-state area that hasn't even been a one-on-one conversation obviously  there's secret messages going back and forth aren't there secret messages we're gonna get into that  in a second but first this  erock's late  erock  erock's late 
[00:02:30]  erock  erock's late  erock  erock's late  erock  on the opian anthony show  why do you have to make it official at the end on the opian anthony show  oh it's gotta be uh can't it just be the erock is late little thing we play  what's wrong to me  because we're about to address erock's tardiness  yes  stupid sam has the video camera out already  oh yeah 
[00:03:00]  sam takes such pleasure in any time erock is on the receiving end of some crap  sam have you ever had your face uh just just squashed  because you really are an ass you haven't been punched  no  no i'm just trying to do my job i want to make sure  how have you avoided a good  sound thrashing  yeah  do you know like kung fu or something  no i just keep like security measures in front of me like nobody here is gonna hit me because they'll get fired  really  yeah 
[00:03:30]  i hope  so you're gonna tell if you get hit is pretty much what you said  oh yeah in a big way  i mean this isn't about me  so uh  right right  it's all about you  he is such a smartass  yes sam definitely is the biggest  uh  of the smartasses  uh  erock just walked in uh  pretty much five minutes ago right  right erock  right at the  pretty much the start of the show  and he gave us an on-air version  and an off-air version of why he 
[00:04:00]  is late  and we all  quickly realize that  the versions are the same  so we're really confused  yeah  i was getting uh  spy reports  um  on on text last night  that erock  was at  the concert at madison square garden  there was a big concert you had  kid rock  leonard skinner  leonard skinner  who else  run dmc  reverend run 
[00:04:30]  reverend run  reverend run  because he's doing his uh  his solo thing  so i was getting reports  and all i'm thinking is  oh boy  this won't bode well  for the program tomorrow  i uh  i was offered a ticket  erock called me  oh yeah  he says uh  i got a couple tickets  would you and uh  your girl like to go  and i said erock  i would love to go  i love to kid rock  yeah  and you know what  i kind of like the letter  skinnered  even though the lead singer  died many many years ago  but uh  ah  hose it down  and then get a new lead singer 
[00:05:00]  and and they've been  they've been rocking ever since  right  yeah  when i got offered uh  erock's ticket  i was like  oh that's right  i wasn't offered erock's ticket  oh  yeah that's right  oh  but i said to erock  it's a school night  i can't go to this concert  i gotta be responsible  but  but you my friend  go and have fun  you had a ticket for that  yeah  apparently extra ones  and everything  extra tickets  that he asked opie  uh  if he wanted to go 
[00:05:30]  and then everybody else  can pretty much just go  f themselves  look i'm on his hero list  what could i do  i know  in a big way  this is what you get  when you're on his hero list  you get offers for  you know  concerts every once in a while  well  and wrestling  are you just hoping  one day he says yes  and you two could hang  like buds  well i had  i had extra tickets  uh  only cause uh  sam and his girlfriend  couldn't make it  so  sam was being responsible  maybe  and getting some sleep  why would you invite sam  sam hates you  no  oh god 
[00:06:00]  sam he's the worst  so what's the on air version  of why you were late  uh  the on air version  is that  i didn't set my alarms  when i got home  and uh  i woke up at 5 30  why did you forget  to set all of them  who forgets to set  their alarms  i just  and the alarms these days  you don't really set them  right  no  yeah they just  you set them once 
[00:06:30]  and then  you turn it off  it's ready to go  for tomorrow  the whole week  right  you have the week  the weekends  different settings  two alarms  independent of each other  what you got old school  alarms still  you crank up an alarm clock  and i go  ring-a-ling-a-ling  how many alarms do you have  there's two  there's uh  one electronic  and one wind-up  in case the power goes  and you have to set them  every night  you got to set the  electronic one  every night 
[00:07:00]  uh  i usually do  yeah  what do you mean  you usually do  either you do  or you don't  because when she gets up  she turns off the alarms  on the electronic clock  because she gets up  um  later than i do  by the way  enough with the  i'm really tired voice  i like that  look  you know  i'm really exhausted  yeah  she gets up  we're all tired  trust me  so you have the one alarm  that you have  as a backup  in case there's no electricity  yeah  okay  you should get a third one  in case you're retarded 
[00:07:30]  i gotta play this  you're a liar  oh wow  god damn liar  no one forgets to  to set their alarm  sorry  sorry pal  no you do have to  turn them on  and off  because when it goes  off in the morning  if you turn it off  and then turn it back on  the alarm keeps going  on the on the clock  what  on the wind up clock 
[00:08:00]  oh he's trying a diversion  i think  no it's not a diversion  no  okay  all right so that's  the on air version  now you gotta tell  the off air version  no i'm not telling  but it's the same version  no but it involves  other people  and i'm not doing that  so just say  this sounds mysterious  you needed you had  don't want to go to  the show with  who'd you go with  jimmy  he could he could  so tell this story  yeah there's not  a bad story  so just don't mention  names  okay  say it's it's people  it's this it's that  just say  somebody who made  the worst decision  of her life  and a couple 
[00:08:30]  of other people  and her friends  what's the off air  version  you kind of like  you know  messed up the show  today so the least  you could do is give  us some good radio  out of it  the off air version  is obviously who i was  with and her friends  had a little too much  fun at the concert  and had to make sure 
[00:09:00]  that some of them  got home okay  okay so how many  of them  renewable  yeah renewable  so what did that  entail making sure  they get home okay  and how much fun  did they have  um they started  partying around  five o'clock  in the afternoon  all right  pre-game for the  big show  so they had  yeah it's all right  so they had a lot of  fun  yeah  was there passing  out at a  involved  yeah there was  oh  a few people 
[00:09:30]  a few people  pretty much right  as uh  kid rock started  right  and uh  can i ask how many  were at the show  with you  yourself and how  many people  there was  eight of us  you and seven  of your posse  the e-rock  posse  yes  okay  and um  about half that  decided to um  pass out  right as kid rock  started  wow 
[00:10:00]  what do you mean  them at rookies.com  passed out  yeah  and half of them  one disappeared  for a while  until we saw  security bring her  back saying she  wasn't allowed to  go near the stage  right that's good  that's a good  one  i love this  visual  e-rock the  babysitter  did you get  buzzed yourself 
[00:10:30]  there e-rock  no i had uh  i was drinking  diet coca  uh drying diet  coca  diet coca  you are  not only did  you you did  drink last night  you're still  drunk  no i didn't  drink  who says diet  coca  no one  because no one  drinks coca  i i did not  so how much  diet coca  did you have  i had to  the only thing  not one drink  the whole night  while everyone  else was partying  with their um 
[00:11:00]  their big plastic  cups and most of  the people around  me uh  indulging in some  illegal activities  i was sitting  there  what kind of  illegal activities  yeah pot  coca  yeah if you  don't work  diet coca  it's your  phone call  today we  don't want  anything to  do with you  i had a  couple diet  cocas  they had a  mirror they  just poured  it on  poured what  jimmy  poured what  diet coca  diet coca  young coca  coca  well the 
[00:11:30]  coca's cut  so much  that it's  diet coca  oh  so uh  so you got  one of them  wandering around  trying to get  on stage to  do what  sing with  kid rock  um i don't  know what  exactly she  was doing at  the stage we  just saw the  uh the the  guard with uh  the little  flashlight bringing  her back over  and saying she  had to stay here  or they were  going to throw  her out  okay  so uh they  brought her  back everybody  else was having  fun and i'm  sitting there with  my uh my  little red cup  of diet soda 
[00:12:00]  and uh  just enjoying  myself pretty  much  okay  sounds like a  great night  yeah  so  you're you're  late because  you had to  make sure they  got home  safely  what time  were you in  your house  uh i got  back about  11 45  okay that's  relatively speaking  that's doable  show and stuff  it's not that  late  it's doable  and if you  hadn't been  drinking  and it's only 
[00:12:30]  11 45  that seems like  a no-brainer  you're you're  fine  yeah um  when i've been  hammered at two  in the morning  and still  remember to  set my  alarm  absolutely  yeah  well how  what did you  mean or what  did you say  i said three  times a week i  go to bed at  midnight and get  oh yeah okay  yeah  well it wasn't  a matter of what  time i got home as  much as i did not  set the alarm when i  did get home  why  i was dealing with 
[00:13:00]  some things  oh oh some  perhaps  iraq you're the  worst  perhaps there  was a  how dumb are  you really  you need to  take an iq test  with a little  back and forth  well he was  drinking diet  coca  he gets home  at 11 45  you're you're in  the right frame of  mind to set  alarm clocks  maybe you're not  in the right frame  of mind to do  trigonometry or  or like negotiate  the middle east  peace treaty but  to set an alarm i  think you could do  that quite easily 
[00:13:30]  i could have yes  i didn't and uh  what were you  dealing with  i was uh  what is this it  couldn't be that  bad no no i i'm  trying to figure  uh was there a  heroin mule staying  at your house  no no um i was  dealing with the  person that i had  to bring home and i  forgot to set the  alarm when i got  into what was wrong  with the person that  brought home  had been uh 
[00:14:00]  partying since  five o'clock that  day and uh  they weren't  feeling too well  uh yeah they  were not feeling  too well  why why so  secretive yeah  everyone like did  you everyone slips  up every once in a  while yeah  so someone you  know had a little  too much to drink  or maybe a little  uh too much  indulging  maybe a little of 
[00:14:30]  that was it  something like that  there iraq did  you have to hold  someone's forehead  maybe a deadlift  out of the cab  too oh and 
[00:15:00]  you well a deadlift  out of the cab is a  rough one considering  you have no muscle  tone that must have  been a nightmare  there  all right iraq  and how long did that  last  uh it was after 12  last i looked  11 45 till after 12  you got home at 11 45 
[00:15:30]  and then it was after  12 so it could be 16  minutes of pure hell  wow that's a that's a  hell of a situation  what time do you  normally get at 4 30  um no it's usually  like uh so it goes  off at 3 45 and at  four o'clock  okay wait a minute  then how come you're  here where do you  live  um i live over in  hoboken

[00:21:00]  i haven't  never  what did you not  get  uh  no  just  leonard skyner  was the first act  and  just  everybody who was  a leonard skyner  fan  was uh  out of their  effing minds  and just  seeing all  this  these psychos  and trash  are you okay  there's something  wrong with him  i'm fine  are you fine  i'm fine  you're in another  world  the first part  he didn't get  what didn't you  comprehend  what didn't you get 
[00:21:30]  it's like a bunch  of guys just playing  instruments  an essay question  it's pretty easy  to get  did you not know  how the sound  was coming  or they decided  to do their show  in german  i mean  what didn't you get  what didn't you get  um  well  besides from  only knowing  i think maybe  two of their songs  um  just  everybody around  how do you only know  two leonard skyner songs  i  honestly  that  i would love to get  a set list now  especially someone  that's been in radio  leonard skyner  all they do  is play their hits 
[00:22:00]  and they had many of them  yeah  they might play  a couple obscure songs  but for the most part  they go with some  longer jams  what was the encore  i  they didn't have an encore  the leonard skyner  yes they did  it was free bird  what was the last song  they played  i didn't realize  jesus christ  were you at the show  i don't even think  he was at the show  i think something's up  something is  something is really up  no i was at the show  i saw some uh  you don't know  that leonard skyner's  last song is free bird  that was the other song 
[00:22:30]  that i knew  but i didn't know  that was  i didn't know  they left the stage  because i wasn't  i came back to my seat  they were doing free bird  i was online  and came back  they were doing free bird  i didn't realize  they left the stage  and came back  to do free bird  what  who were you online for  diacocca  hot dog  hot dog  i don't think  he was at the show  there's some  something he's not  telling here  this should have been  a five or ten minute story 
[00:23:00]  we know  we know  i apologize to the listeners  but something is going on  here today  i think he's folding  on the questioning  he certainly is  ng  i didn't get it  you didn't get it  a rock show  no i  and then you didn't know  that they played free bird  anthony had to tell you  that they have a song  called free bird  no i knew free bird  i just didn't know  that was the encore  that was the encore  because when i left  they were on stage  when i came back  they were on stage  and then they left  and then it took a while  till uh  till kid rock came on  but anthony asked you  what was the last song  they played  and you didn't know 
[00:23:30]  that was the encore  i didn't know  that was  usually the encore  is they finish  they leave the stage  and then they come back  and do one or two songs  that's the encore  yeah but if you sat down  and they're playing free bird  and then they don't come back  you would know  that free bird  was the last song  thank you anthony  and they were also  the first band playing  so i figured  they did a full set  and they left  because then they had  to set up for kid rock  and uh  and the guy from  jay giles band  and reverend run  all three of them  together  yeah  peter  peter wolf  yeah  yeah 
[00:24:00]  but it was  kid rock show  but between  all right  what's  how many songs  did you sit through  leonard skydard  that i didn't know  the names of  were two  what two  uh  sweet home alabama  and free bird  but you didn't know  free bird  yeah  no i knew free bird  i didn't know  that was the encore  i could name  20 leonard skydard songs  they would  they probably  would have played  a concert  and i haven't  listened to skydard  uh  actively  in a long time  the only other song  that i i knew  well kind of knew 
[00:24:30]  was because they had  part of the lyrics  up on the screen  on the stage  yeah  it was a song  that goes that smell  well you should know  that one  i didn't know that  i want to dedicate this  to eric's toothbrush  eric i want to see you  from the stage  lift up your diet coca  this one's for you brother  hope your chick's  feeling better  and why is this  whore trying to  get on stage 
[00:25:00]  ruining my vibe  man  something's up b-rock  no  we've been doing  this a very long  time  no  you are not  telling the truth  you barely saw  leonard skyd  you barely saw  this concert  did they dedicate  simple man to you  thanks chris  or call me the breeze  as in his brain  nothing  all right i tried  you gotta boo yourself 
[00:25:30]  occasionally  all right we gotta  take a break  uh but uh we're not  gonna drop this uh  this storyline today  certainly not  we have another one  i believe going on too  yeah well we want to  get to the anthony thing  and the secret messages  that are going back and  forth between him and  jill nicolini the  traffic girl here in  new york city on  channel 11  i haven't sent any  secret messages  well she's been  sending secret messages  all morning long  during her traffic  reports and we're  gonna get into that  right after the break  love is in the air my  friends  uh a lot of people 
[00:26:00]  think you're on drugs  eric yeah yeah  are you on cold  medicine or something  eric is on drugs  did he get later  uh  eric was it better  than air supply  does eric have an  eye patch on  eric would make a  horrible trucker  uh  jim was late yesterday  lay off eric  yeah but when jim's  late there's no it's  it's the story is  simple  yeah i just was i  was i relapsed did  drugs and i overslept  right  that's it 
[00:26:30]  i was the last time i  was late was probably a  year before that i  literally have not  overslept like that in  a year  huh  i probably haven't  overslept that's all  right  but when eric comes  running in and says he's  got an on-air version and  an off-air version why he's  late and it's the same  story you gotta go there  it's a little weird and  then he didn't get the  first band and right  yeah and then know the  encore and and he said  that the reason he's late  was because he had to  leave the concert early  like what  wouldn't you be late  because you stayed all  the way to the end and  then got stuck in traffic 
[00:27:00]  which makes it more of a  nightmare to get home  yeah  when the you know the  clock is ticking as far  as uh you know you  getting some good sleep  in  and then he says he had  to deal with his with  somebody that was staying  with it at his house  jesus but but he only  had to deal with that  for 15 minutes usually  when your girl or  somebody is you know  really sick from a  concert oh it could be  hours hours of like you  know rubbing their back  and taking care of them  yelling in eric's case it

[00:28:30]  have to go back to yesterday's  show because we got all  sorts of updates we got uh we  got newspapers interested in  this story really the fans are  very interested in this story  are they though i think your  mommy's very interested in this  possibility i haven't spoken to  my mommy i know your sister  roachin said don't blow this  one anthony what a lot of  pressure on you i i understand  that yes there is is there 
[00:29:00]  really uh the message boards  going nuts with the news that  there there might be some uh  some love in the air i was  steering clear of any message  boards oh you don't want to go  there i don't want to look it's  a little ugly right now but  basically um how do we begin  this i guess uh we had mick foley  on the show yesterday yeah one of  our good friends and uh he just  did an interview with uh channel  11 here in new york it's always  fun they usually do that before  they come over here so we were  watching uh the news yesterday 
[00:29:30]  the wb 11 right here in new  york and uh mick foley was on  and i was commenting how he  looked like a caveman yeah yeah  certainly and then uh you know  a few minutes later they wound  up coming in here and it's like  hey i just saw that guy on tv and  then he had uh a message from  jill nicolini which was odd i  thought it was gonna just be you  know hey tell the guys i said hi  right it was a bombshell are you  dubbing this a bombshell oh yeah  it came out of nowhere out of  nowhere a bombshell a bombshell 
[00:30:00]  wow okay so what we did because  it was going on all morning  yesterday we kind of condensed it  down to a quick like minute and a  half here you uh you got the mick  foley telling uh telling us what  jill nicolini said and then i think  we got a phone call from jill  nicolini and then i think we  finished it up with uh with uh dating  advice from bill shatner is that what  we're about to hear oh that's not in  there yet okay because then it then  it took on a life of its own uh bill  shatner who was scheduled to do an  interview now is giving you dating 
[00:30:30]  advice yeah so this is how it went down  yesterday it's the condensed version  swimmies she said she is a single  sorry bill i don't know if he would  give that version or uh or a pair of a  bikini uh made out of lead  who knows what really happened  oh no the news is doing another grape  stomping event  uh-oh no how the last one turned out  so uh this starts with mick foley with 
[00:31:00]  the message from uh jill nicolini she  said she is a single and b interested  what well i'm i'm newly single by the  way she told me and uh i gotta go  gotta go let's get jill nicolini on  before she does her next track oh jesus  has nothing to do between traffic  reports let's see if we did i want to 
[00:31:30]  get to the bottom of this uh this  crush that she might have on it right  i want to watch anthony fall apart  oh yeah uh jill yes hello to  understand hi jill we got mick foley in  studio and you guys just had him on tv  jill i uh hello mick hi guys it's okay  that i quoted you directly right yes my  quote directly to mick was that i'm  single these days i heard anthony single  and single and and is he available uh  yeah well you see there's a lot of 
[00:32:00]  girls here at the cw who want dibs on  anthony and i said well hey i'm  recently single why can't i get him so  i'm calling to um ask if maybe anthony  wants to go out and we're we're both uh  you know out on long island right yeah  we're close by practically neighbors and  grew up you know similar areas  neighborhoods same friends same people  we have a lot in common i think and you  enjoy maybe going out having a drink or  something i would love to but don't take  me out like i'm thirsty thursday or  anything no no no i wouldn't do that is 
[00:32:30]  this a bit or would you really go out on  a date with anthony i really want to go  out on a date with anthony oh you guys  really go out what day you want to have a  drink what day you're gonna do this let's  do it you tell me next week i'm available  next week i'll call jill you're available  and uh today well stop by on his way home  and grab you i'll call jill and we'll set  something up give it a few days don't look  desperate and uh that was what went on  yesterday just watching dumb anthony try  to end that before it got something bad 
[00:33:00]  happening yeah is that what i was doing i'll  email you i'll call you i'll call you hang up  now immediately yeah there's too many tools  on the phone oh we're gonna fast forward a  year into this relationship anthony will  just come in like staring straight ahead  what happened she didn't come home again  last night she'll ruin him she's gonna  ruin anthony  yeah but you should take care of this it 
[00:33:30]  always starts well but uh yeah so haven't  even had our first phone call we've been  killing you just stop with the predictions  of the future we've been killing anthony  ever since that went down yesterday and  then uh after the show yesterday we had  to go into tim's studio and we kind of  like just uh you know we kind of riff into  the microphones and try to come up with a  promo that they can run here in new york  city and here's uh just some of the audio  this was supposed to be just a quick like  five seconds opi here um my pal anthony 
[00:34:00]  is deeply in love with jill nicolini  wait a minute that doesn't mean what that  could you be a little more subtle  why because uh it's not a love or anything  it's you know we're gonna just go out for a  couple of drinks like i said anthony is  deeply in love each other with jill nicolini  why does this have to turn into like fifth grade  there's a love thing happening yeah yeah you and jill  nicolini the traffic girl from channel are we are we 
[00:34:30]  sitting in a tree k-i-s-s-i-n-g i don't know  are you  why can't two adults uh just go out and and have a  drink or something and talk without you guys just  being total jackasses about it are you gonna  stupor  shut up there's not one moment that i could just  have on the show without it having to turn into some goddamn 
[00:35:00]  fifth grade uh event with you juveniles  what base are you hoping to get to see exactly exactly  i'm thinking third base what do you think shut up  so that was uh right after the show yesterday and as we do this i see anthony  staring at the tv i'm all distracted now at his future wife  future wife look at all those green cars the traffic looks good today  yeah does it doesn't it look at uh oh there's an accident in jersey 
[00:35:30]  point it out jill oh that's it oh that's roadways i thought that was  and oh well there's the hair flip oh no  all right a little ear scratch is that for anthony  yeah hold on hold on what there may have actually been a coded message in that  when i had the guys watching in the office did she no she didn't say it in that  well now we got to give you the update um that was a message by the way  we're yeah of course it was i don't know we got it we got so around five o'clock 
[00:36:00]  five thirty we're all in the office and steve pops his head out and he goes uh  uh watch jill's traffic she's gonna have a secret message for anthony i swear to god  is that true very true thank you and what was the secret message the first secret  message she did today on tv for when you see that yeah she said something like  it's a secret message that means call me uh it was a hair flip and a nose scratch i believe  yeah right secret message so steve runs out and goes jill's gonna give anthony a secret message  it's gonna be a hair flip and and an itch of the nose and we're like shut up so then she she pops on 
[00:36:30]  and we're watching her traffic and she flips her hair and then at the end she like just you know  scratches her nose real fast yeah yeah she's giving secret message to anthony instead of doing the  traffic well she does the traffic what's the signal she's going to wiggle her bosoms after  announcing a truck fire  and then there was um then there was a wink well then like all right that was funny but she's not 
[00:37:00]  gonna like continue this she's got a job to do uh-oh so then there was another text that said  sorry uh i'm sorry for interrupting there was a coded message in that last one yes as well yes  jimmy caught it it was the ear touch the ear yeah yeah it's like carol burnett at the end of this  she's been writing steve in between traffic reports going this is what i'm gonna do next for anthony  this is the real deal what was the second secret message it was that one was really funny it was  at the very end of her report she uh winked at the camera yeah she goes i'm gonna wink at the camera  that's uh that's a message for anthony what was the message that make sure he calls me that was a 
[00:37:30]  call me anthony yeah she's got a pretty good wink she's like pretty yeah it didn't look like you  know some people can't wink it looks like they're right right got a bug in their eye or something  yeah she gets a real quick wink there right at the end of the traffic she gave probably the most  seductive wink i've ever seen a nice wink with her big eyes she just gave a big blink oh they're  big aren't they of course starting to notice everything huh she'll become obsessed and then  like anthony's like it's not going to work out and then she gives little signals like she hangs an 
[00:38:00]  anthony doll by the way she's doing the traffic and i hope an escalate is on fire on the expressway  so if you're stuck in traffic we apologize but uh you know the traffic girl's too busy  giving secret messages to anthony today she's doing the traffic what the hell's going on she's  doing her job uh very uh fine now a girl like jill nicolini right it's friday you gotta call like  right now she's she's booked by noon for the weekend i can't call right now we're both working

[00:45:00]  nose scratch a little winky wink wink wink and wait i made a reference about calling our traffic tip  line and i really meant for anthony to call me that was it was a call well jill you will absolutely get  a call i think as long as you don't call me restricted i don't pick up a restricted call so  call you restricted i'm a restraining order 
[00:45:30]  or something no no faxes bank account numbers if you want to  so anthony i i heard uh some of the show yesterday and i heard that i'm i'm moving in  and you're going to be driving a honda yeah apparently uh people think um things are going to change  i'll ask you this you don't like kids i've been hearing that you're having a hard time with  children these days are you are you looking uh for a relationship maybe that uh ends with uh 
[00:46:00]  marriage and children at some point i want a lot of kids like five five kids  i do i really do it's a matter of finding the right person though and then  well yeah see it's a matter of finding the right person and that's i think you know something uh that  can be you know dealt with over time we can hang out yeah exactly we can do you know hang out talk 
[00:46:30]  a little at some point if things are going well i'm sure that discussion will come up  all the discussions here now don't avoid it do you or do you don't want kids anthony you know uh  people know me off the air as really loving children oh my god what is up i uh i have a very  a soft spot uh for kids um yeah i i love kids the more the merrier i say she's gonna ruin them oh yeah 
[00:47:00]  you are done done my friend more the merrier so five is okay with you five is a good if if that's  it if that's enough for you i mean five is fine uh but you said you have said in the should i talk  here i don't i don't hope your spot but you have said that kids ruin a girl's body no girls if if  girls are in shape they snap right back is what it is and jill's in very good shape  and also we could if there was a problem with that we could always have a surrogate mother so you know 
[00:47:30]  know it could be my egg your sperm and someone else could carry it and then my body would still  remain perfect you know if you're up for that and they can take it with them and uh take care of it  and raise it i wouldn't mind that either thank you so so um and i also heard some of william  shatner's comments and uh when we do go out are you really going to record me or no i would never uh  do that vedar little private moment you promise yeah i i really swear i would never do something 
[00:48:00]  like that that would be awful intrusion you know what uh make believe we're not here and just like  set it up for the weekend like this doesn't count with your phone call just to let you know this is a  group phone call yeah i'm expecting a private phone call later but we can pretend no abs i will  absolutely call you and we will set something up for for next week during the week i'm excited  yeah i think she wants us why not the weekend why not a saturday maybe because it's short notice and 
[00:48:30]  i don't want to put her in an awkward position where she already has plans i do i have some family  obligations say i know things like this so we'll talk and we'll we'll start out maybe with something uh  an early dinner during the week because i know we're both the morning people with work yeah that  that kind of works you know to our advantage we both have the same hours yeah kind of nice to find  someone who wants to go to sleep early you know and wrong guy yeah no what time do you go to bed 
[00:49:00]  usually uh anywhere between 10 and 2 in the morning that's exactly what i do see it's all it all depends  on you know what's going on so yeah yeah maybe if we're out having a good time it'll be one of  those later nights uh and uh you know for you know we're going to have a busy day the next day we could  cut it short a little early and uh you know do it again well good i can't wait and uh yeah i can't 
[00:49:30]  either i think it'll be a lot of fun jill me too is there anything else that you'd like me to signal  to you i mean i did an ear pull i i think your improv is fantastic and i uh i wouldn't want to taint that  but in all fairness we got a lot of listeners now they want to see the secret message so  maybe you could give us what the secret message is going to be for the next traffic report  oh well you have some already right i believe that we sent them over to you so that yeah  no but you got to like announce it on the air because i'm telling you everyone's going to turn 
[00:50:00]  off our show to watch your next traffic oh is it going to be another one you're going to see a rating  spike but you got to tell us what the message is ahead of time then they're going to see it and go  oh my god this is real i will keep texting cc and i'll give him all the details and i'll think of  something whether it's a touch a pull a tug or a hello maybe i could just do a general hello to  anthony who lives out in long island that would be nice i don't want to speak for anthony but i think  he's home for a tug and a pull hey don't be shut up you are just you are the destroyer

[01:00:00]  jill nicolini this is what bill shatner had to say you gotta excuse anthony he fell in love uh today  and uh he's a little distracted so uh jesus he fell in love today yeah when they uh up on the elevator he  saw the book the one uh and i came over with a direct quote and i said anthony jill nicolini  wants you to know two things she is a available and be interested and uh they got they got her on 
[01:00:30]  the horn and we set up a little uh love connection live live she's hot yeah exactly you didn't think  of me in that moment what i don't know what what do you think bill uh how do i handle something like  that i think you've handled it exactly right what does it say about anthony when they're getting  a date with jill nicolini is the second best thing that happens to him on the show hey you know i i  have my priorities i have to i'll have to tune into channel 11 and take a look at what's your next 
[01:01:00]  date yes certainly where are you gonna go certainly will i think there's a nice place uh around what do  you think of this bill i i suggested a nice restaurant that's kind of near my house because  we both live on long island oh really uh but long island is long it's an island that's long yeah but  but uh it's close enough we're within proximity of each other there so i suggest something near the  house and then it will go out and then and then hey how about you know i show you uh because i'm 
[01:01:30]  having some work done on the house having a pool put in the back and you know and here's the side  benefit of all that you can go on a date and the weather will be nice see yeah when should we go  well let's see the sun will be out uh on thursday so let's go and sit outside and dine al fresco yeah  a little advice from bill shadner yes now um we got what you said about kids today 
[01:02:00]  i got two examples too i mean we could have pulled 10 yeah uh how about we we start with  what you have said about kids in the past uh i don't think it's any that why not just play what  i said just before because i don't there's no real difference why not just read what he's been charged  with  in the past you said this about kids i have nothing to say to kids i don't know how to talk to them  what do you say they come up and show you something uh uncle anthony look at the oh neat 
[01:02:30]  get out of here i don't remember saying that and that's sad because uh your brother uh became a  father yesterday well see i said we haven't told this neat we haven't told this side of the show by  the way uh brother joe is now yes he's a daddy and uh you're now an uncle yeah i'm an uncle for  whatever that means you know it's a good thing don't feel any different you also said this about 
[01:03:00]  kids in the past here's what it is i've got it okay having a baby seems to be like when you fell  asleep next to the bean pod in invasion of the body snatchers when before it happens you're fighting a  tooth and nail you hate it you look at the people that have changed and go oh my god look at him  he's pointing out everybody what is he doing i don't want to live this life of of post bean pod  and you fight it tooth and nail and and the bean pod people look evil and horrible and nasty and it's 
[01:03:30]  terrible way to go through life there's there's no uh you're you're lacking some of the things  that you would have had uh prior to the bean pods pre-pod then you go to sleep next to the pod you  wake up and all of a sudden you're one of them everything's fine you're not sad you don't miss  what you had because you really you're in another phase of your your life yeah i don't want to fall  asleep next to the bean pod ever i like pre-bean pod 
[01:04:00]  so yeah i i said that yeah you make it uh very obvious and the part about before like the kid  example you gave before yeah if the kid just comes up and goes uncle anthony look and he went get out  of here yeah can you be showing a little picture they drew for you oh those things a little things  look so bad why do you got to tell kids oh that's so nice when everyone knows they look like crap  they can't stay in the lines when they color it's it's adorable you're gonna ruin it so jesus

[01:09:30]  that installed it to do that and they did it so now one of the bedrooms actually is labeled as keith's  suite on it and uh i think that's going to have to be changed when jill gets to tour of the house  she'll probably look at all the pillows and wonder where they have like teeth marks in them  what happened no teeth marks in the pillows when is uh when is the magic going to be called jill's  house i can't wait till she owns it oh shut up he's gonna be ruined get out of here this ends with

[01:14:00]  itself there and he just probably like looks down like there's nothing needs to be said here  i mean god damn uh am i gonna have to take her to the premiere of sex in the city  you know what's gonna you know what's gonna suck if this becomes a real relationship man we're gonna  have a lot of apologizing to do you are  i mean i'm polite  don't we

[01:25:00]  a mobile is that wrong a mobile i knew it was mobile  a mobile like a big gas station you idiots  i knew it was hanging up there like a texaco  i knew i did that yeah and anthony already has kids running around his house and uh  that house is my baby proofed oh i don't have kids running around that house oh you  now i think that's exaggerated humor uh john hicksville what's up hey how long before you

[01:26:00]  no to do a baby diaper mustache for for you no it would be an honor my friend it's not gonna happen  all right the big news today uh well the bush thing and the obama thing what do we know about this  what the uh george bush was in israel uh-huh celebrating uh what 60 years of uh israel  uh and uh some people said he took the opportunity to give a little jab at barack obama by talking 
[01:26:30]  about um how certain politicians back in uh the late 30s were saying if we only could have talked to  hitler you know if i only would have talked to hitler maybe things wouldn't uh be like they are  uh when obviously hitler you wouldn't have been able to talk to him he he couldn't have talked about  anything um so i guess he was equating that to iran and how certain people want to talk to iran or 
[01:27:00]  hamas and um being in israel that kind of makes sense especially since uh the iranian president's  talking about wiping israel off the face of the earth every week uh so even though i'm not you know  the biggest bush fan believe me it seems like obama's camp is taking his statements and politicizing  him and using him to their own advantage a lot more than bush was by just saying the statement  because they're all coming out and condemning it as this direct bash at uh barack obama because he 
[01:27:30]  at some point said that we should have a dialogue with uh iran right and uh some of these other  nations that are the you know axis of evil uh nations um so all his people are jumping on the  bandwagon and bashing bush and just saying it's an awful terrible thing he did using this occasion of  israel's 60th anniversary to uh uh politically bash barack obama which i didn't see that he did  well let's listen to it the president didn't use barack obama's name but speaking here he seemed to 
[01:28:00]  suggest that the democratic frontrunner and other members of his party are deluded when it comes to  dealing with america's fiercest foes some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and  radicals as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along we've heard  this foolish delusion before yeah see so what are we supposed to do just uh wipe by iran off the map 
[01:28:30]  uh no it's but i think he goes until they start bush's uh policy has always been until they start acting  like civilized people in in this world um that they shouldn't be uh spoken to you can't sit down  and negotiate and talk uh peace with these people and and get them into the world uh um and trade with  them when their rhetoric every other week is you know we're gonna wipe this one off the face of the 
[01:29:00]  earth and this one's uh horrible israel's gone in a week you know stuff like that so he equated it to  nazi germany president bush went on to raise comparisons to a senator who just before the  start of world war ii said lord if i could have only talked to hitler we have an obligation to call  it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history obama has  repeatedly stated that as president he would sit down for direct talks with the leaders of iran and north 
[01:29:30]  korea among others obama's calling bush's statements a false political attack quote george bush knows  i've never supported engagement with terrorists and that's that wow and that's that i don't understand  though why we won't sit down with iran or other countries who i don't like but yet we continually  expect hamas and israel to talk all we do is scream about how people have to talk in the middle east 
[01:30:00]  and then there's people in the middle east that we don't want to talk to yeah it's one of these who's  going to blink first thing though it looks i think uh the policy of uh george bush is it looks weak to go  in there and open a dialogue with people um because you're almost exposing yourself you're like saying  look we want to talk and uh some people see that as a weakness it's like look we're not even going to  talk to you until you start acting like a civilized nation but the fact of the matter is we talk with 
[01:30:30]  saudi arabia and they are awful to their people they are horrid of course to their uh women um uh  uh diverse lifestyles uh they're just awful uh the way they they punish uh certain criminals for  for nothing uh a woman gets raped and she gets blamed and put in jail for it uh beaten it's  ridiculous but i guess you know but how does it do business with them how does it end obviously you  can't just sit down and talk it ends when other people get in uh over there and perhaps they're a 
[01:31:00]  a little more moderate like some people have promised that maybe cuba at some point with  castro being out we'll be able to negotiate with them and talk with them and maybe set up some kind  of trade with them uh but as long as castro is in there no one was dealing with them uh the whole  rest of the world deals with them except us yeah so stupid and it was it's over cold war stuff it's  like holding a grudge for stuff that's been done with for years nonsense it's it's nonsense 
[01:31:30]  mushar we talked to he's he's a dictator i mean yeah well they did have like they did have nukes  pointed at us so well the so they were kind of soviet puppets yeah and and once the soviet union  was dissolved cuba pretty much just became a great resort area that we couldn't but i think we're  making a point to the rest of the world don't point your nukes at us because then then don't point  then we're gonna make life for you a living hell for the for the rest of your your country's history  but we talked to russia now was there yeah i understand weapons yeah sure on a mere putin 
[01:32:00]  yeah stupid bushes and starting about holding hands with other men in a garden yeah that looks  silly that just looked silly creepy right stop speaking of uh bush uh keith oberman  oh this guy oh don't get on his bedside yeah he's wild he flipped out last night on tv boy did  he jimmy did he grovel in front of jesse jackson again i was for the firing sir  yeah he's shut up he uh yells and screams uh behind closed doors irritating mr bush has predicted 
[01:32:30]  that the election of a democratic president could quote eventually lead to another attack on the  united states this ludicrous infuriating holier than thou and most importantly boneheadedly wrong  statement came yesterday during an interview with politico.com and online users of yahoo the  question was phrased as follows if we were to pull out of iraq next year what's the worst that  could happen what's the doomsday scenario and the president replied doomsday scenario of course is  that extremists throughout the middle east would be emboldened which would eventually lead to another 
[01:33:00]  attack on the united states the biggest issue we face is it's bigger than iraq it's this ideological  struggle against cold-blooded killers who will kill people to achieve their political objectives  you tell them keith how is that wrong though like yeah i don't get what was so bad there there's two  sides to the whole thing i mean we look at them we look at them the enemy in that light and they look 
[01:33:30]  at us in the same light they could turn around and say you know we're invading sovereign nations  we're doing this blah blah blah but uh so and i guess until something gives whether it is dialogue with them  uh or all-out war it's just going to remain this stalemate of of fear and uh lack of understanding  uh of each other and you know it just stays the way it is that's why i kind of do like the idea that  something changes i i believe me i ain't voting democrat but you you would like you might though 
[01:34:00]  something you gotta wait to see who jill likes oh you think i'm just gonna follow suit  and who jill votes for i want to get i want to get the ultimate test going we got to get jill back  on the phone i got a few more questions for her there's a there's a i don't want to could you leave  her alone i don't want to she's at work i'll say i'll say when she's on the phone we got your real 
[01:34:30]  opinion on kids let's just put it that way i want to get your real opinion on a few other issues  leave her alone keith continued mr bush at long last has it not dawned on you that the america you  have now created includes cold-blooded killers who will kill people to achieve their political  objectives they are those in or formerly in your employ who may yet be charged someday with war crimes  anyone else get it keith oberman is calling the president of the united states mr bush oh yeah it's  just i heard that on the news we get it keith i heard that on the news yesterday not even like a 
[01:35:00]  commentary show someone else but uh a newscast saying mr bush was in israel yesterday and it was  like who the hell ever a news person saying mr bush right and then finally he really don't listen  talking about hillary and sir if you have any hopes that next january 20th will not be celebrated as a  day of soul-wrenching heartfelt thanksgiving because your faithless stewardship of this presidency 
[01:35:30]  will have finally come to a merciful end this last piece of advice when somebody asks you sir about  democrats who must now pull this country back from the abyss you have placed us at when somebody asks  you sir about the cooked books and faith threats you foisted on a sincere and frightened nation when  somebody asks you sir about your gallant noble self-abnegating sacrifice of your golf game  so as to soothe the families of the war dead this advice mr bush shut the hell up oh wow 
[01:36:00]  he wanted to say the f word he sounds like his computer shut off halfway through his show wow  that keith oberman don't get on his bad side maniacal he used a lot of big words in there too big words  oh there's something so smug and irritating about him how about the dreadfully sorry groveling yeah  clinton apology you know what he should have done at the end of that he should have gone shut the hell 
[01:36:30]  up uh i uh oh he's awful i want to change gears a little bit because i was watching keith oberman last  night i flip around at night a little bit right and this thing came on uh his show and it confused me and i  might be putting myself um in the bucket oh but i hope so uh look at this thing to the right  like what is that she's like the most beautiful like say it well say it when you say lesbian you 
[01:37:00]  have to use the d word like she confuses me what is she confuses you see like i look at her and she  she has a very pretty face but she kind of looks like a man kind of manly uh-huh very manly and i'm  i'm looking at the her name's what rachel maddow she's becoming like um a star she's she's on a lot 
[01:37:30]  and she was on last night and i got a little confused were you feeling a little odd about your  sexuality uh i'm trying to figure out like she's almost got an adam's apple oh yes she does it's  happening there what it do we know anything yeah she's on air america and she's on air america  on air america and msnbc's been grabbing her for a while but yeah she is their uh she i think lesbian  firebrand now yeah here she's got the hairdo and everything but here's she's got a guy's haircut 
[01:38:00]  without a doubt oh yeah most of us have the same hairdo here at the opian anthony show but she's  she's got a beautiful face like if she grew her hair out she could be one of the hottest girls on tv i'm  thinking i don't mind her with the short hair i like really if the face is right it looks okay  she looks good it's the adam's apple let's all be honest that's what's getting you there is there  is an adam's apple i think you're now coming to an understanding aren't you no jimmy you'll all  make mistakes i want to shop some hair on her i'm far from that but anthony do you understand what  i'm saying like no you don't see cuteness in there uh i'm not really attracted to many girls uh 
[01:38:30]  on television no the hair one i'm telling a special girl i understand but the hair is distracting  you like grow out the hair but she wears like manly like clothes and stuff the hair is distracting me  what the beard and mustache jesus that's a guy she's a road scholar she looks like matt dylan yeah okay i  could see that oh matt dylan is that another picture of all right well that one does oh come 
[01:39:00]  on all right listen wearing man clothes with a complete man hairdo that picture does not confuse  me whatsoever it was just like dustin diamond in that photo yeah she she is all man in that photo  that's not the one i'm talking about no don't do the old switcheroo on onaradio.com use that one  so what is she she's a she's definitely a a lesbian yeah she is and she's huge on uh msnbc now and  the new air america since randy rhodes left got yeah got screwed i was i was studying the tv last 
[01:39:30]  night trying to figure out what she was all about like she could be a really hot chick but she obviously  doesn't want to be known as a hot chick does she put on the deep uh you know lesbian voice slightly  deep no yes slightly deep stunt brain yes a little a little bit a little bit can we hear her do we  have a little audio of her well keith what i think is um i don't uh agree at all she's a superstar in 
[01:40:00]  the making though you're gonna see her everywhere i mean it's already begun beginning but what her  and keith just agreeing with each other well keith two predictable idiots on msnbc all right that's  going crazy holding this sign up oh could you please break jeff in jersey right she's a handsome  woman that's that's a good oh a handsome woman that's a very good uh description of or a pretty  man yeah yeah yeah we got greg uh giraldo joining the show in just a second here uh 
[01:40:30]  let's say hi to pete in connecticut pete hey how's it going boys good evening good evening  hey i just wanted to uh say another reason why government might be hesitant to speak to a  fringe government is if you're opening yourself up to say all right iran we'll talk to you then  maybe you have someone who's a little bit more on the fringe like hamas say hey if you if you talk  to iran then why don't you talk to us or you know a group like al-qaeda even says hey you talk to 
[01:41:00]  hamas now you're going to why don't you talk to us so what they get backtracked that too the other  way and iran can say well if you talk to them how come you're not talking to us and with people we  actually talk to right exactly so it's silly if you deny you're talking to russia how come you  won't talk to us so go it works both ways it's silly just talk to who we want to and don't talk  to the al-qaeda is a little different it's not a country right on all right it's a group of freedom  fighters thank you p sure wow who's that was andy dick on the screen yeah that's the same girl 
[01:41:30]  that's what i'm saying that that is that that doesn't confuse me whatsoever oh come on that's  a guy do you have to do it up so much that's a guy right there yes wow oh yeah she doesn't like  matthew modine good call fan if you show this picture to uh i don't know ten guys nine would say  it's a guy that's right now it looks like a gay guy easily but the the picture i was showing you  guys from msnbc last night i i think someone might have got to her and said look if you soften you 
[01:42:00]  soften yourself up a little bit i think america's gonna like like you yeah right there's a drastic  difference there isn't there jimmy yeah she's got like kind of like some soft makeup on and stuff  the picture before that she has you know big glasses on she's wrapped in american flag her hair is not  does raise a stubble just looks like a man all right we're gonna go to the fu line as we go to  break here thanks for calling the opian anthony fu line here's the latest batch of fu's you have

[01:45:30]  i'm gonna be pretty funny now i got a good feeling i got a good feeling about nothing offensive just  embracing everybody warmth you know yeah there's nothing funnier than a born again comic yeah i  would imagine i don't think i've ever seen one but i bet they're hysterical they are there are a bunch  of them out there are there really yeah like the pope but you know folks because he's everything  he says is so funny fighting the demons huh yeah well got it got out of hand you know you know how it  goes all right were you uh one of those guys uh you know like jimmy or voss or every other comic on 
[01:46:00]  the face of the earth that seems to uh secret secretly gay yeah exactly yeah no no i'm not  some reason can't just uh tip one beer every so often oh i'm definitely one of those guys are you  yeah yeah wow and were you were you in that boat then clap now yeah yeah well god bless god bless how  long i've been 18 years but greg's one of these guys i think he hit it well uh well you'd be surprised  i mean i hit it among the most part yeah for the most part and then uh we heard some rumblings 
[01:46:30]  here and there but i'm like greg girardo really he hit it well until he turned into harvey keitel from  the bad lieutenant in the cellar yeah well you know colin quinn talked to me about five years ago  you know you guys stop it stupid that it was like but it was it was uh you know a long time ago but i  i would pull it together for stretches which is why uh why people were fooled you know yeah but then  i would disappear and uh all kind of comedians was there one instance instance that uh well there 
[01:47:00]  you go wow tons and tons of them the last thing that happened that was really you know i'd been up  for days and i was on an airplane and i was convinced that i was being followed i was in full-blown  oh no i thought i was being followed by a team of of operatives on this and i'm totally serious  and i was what if you were well that's the thing that freaks you out because sometimes you are like  there's cops right here when you turn around like i was in an airport i thought there was a cop on a  segway following me i thought i gotta be freaking hallucinating that and i turned around there  really was a cop on a segway following me so sometimes did you have any reason to fear the  police at that point of course you know whenever you've been up for several days there's probably 
[01:47:30]  a reason why you fear the police yeah it's this particular time i was on the plane and these guys  were i was convinced they were following me and i looked around it was like an indian woman sleeping  behind me and a guy in a business suit next to me i'm like it's a team and so i got finally i  couldn't take it anymore i got up and i walked i sat next to the guy and i go why are you following me why  you follow me and he goes i have no idea what you're talking about and i go it's international  you're international wow i was completely positive that they were a team i turned around the indian  woman behind me i asked her why yes you're doing a very bad job of fake sleeping and she she freaked 
[01:48:00]  out you know and when i landed there were cops waiting at the airport ah that'll do it when cops  are waiting for you at the airport yeah there's a problem you're like the cops waiting yeah oh yeah yeah  well you're not allowed to just go sitting next to all the passengers asking them why they're  following you around what was your explanation when you got off the plane i told them you know  the weird thing was i'd taken these pills that seemed to uh uh level the effect of everything  else was going on and somehow you know like when you take those you know benzo things they they make  you feel like you're totally fine so like you're comfortable about it so you're not even nervous and 
[01:48:30]  i was just telling i just told well no i just sometimes get a little paranoid i guess i thought i  was crazy and then i said that i had taken some xanax or something and uh but that um you know that  and they asked me if i had a prescription for them i said no because you're so not worried about  anything you're admitting basically confessing to anything and uh they said well you know he could  arrest you right now being under the influence of um prescription drugs without a prescription and  i said well i'm sorry i just you know i get nervous flying and uh and they they they called the tour  manager because it was in tallahassee and they called the tour managers they said everyone we could 
[01:49:00]  call and she just talked to them and they let me go they said just get me get in the cab and go to the  hotel all right had the gig though that was great i killed him no that was the end that was the last  in fact i don't think it you should be selling out everywhere uh after today's appearance who  wouldn't want to see greg giraldo now yeah that was an ugly run for sure oh wow why are you following  me on how creepy is that oh man it was really really creepy and i was keeping notes the whole time i look  at my notes you know because i had some things and i was like just paranoid that they were like taking 
[01:49:30]  records and then they had diagrams of where i was putting everything and wow that's like uh that's like  that movie there um beautiful mind oh yeah yeah you really do i mean i don't know if you've ever  been in any kind of full-blown paranoid hallucination but it's it's you should try it give it a whirl  really really freaks out when you think like the ice machine is coming to get you like i would  literally stay in a hotel and just like laying flat on my stomach looking out under the door waiting  for the ice because i kept hearing the ice machine can't get you what would it want uh you know maybe 
[01:50:00]  to start to cool things a little oh okay yeah yeah well you start thinking it's like a giant robot or  uh you know if you stay up long it's really start to can't move it is a robot by definition  you start thinking it's a large electronic contract yeah is this just from um uh pills and alcohol what  kind of combination was there there uh well the bit you know no uh because that sounds like coke yeah  well that's it sounds a little like because i kind of remember the old days looking out the window 
[01:50:30]  going what's that car that just drove by oh yeah yeah especially after after several days that's what  starts really several days that sleep deprivation yeah would somebody see the ice machine walking  and call the lobby well he was tapping on your door completely that was the one glitch in my logic  the whole team of international uh law operatives following me on the plane i couldn't have reasoned  my way through that i think yeah no you really become convinced that people are running to your window  to your door and running away again and just you know wow things in a carpet start moving and 
[01:51:00]  attacking you and drugs are bad oh it's horrible man it was really it was you know and that was  that was as bad as i mean it's been bad on and off for years but that that last you know i got  separated from my wife and i was i was living in this hotel in midtown and i was just around the  clock crazy yeah that's why we haven't seen him in a while i think i was supposed to be here one day  yeah i think so but i did i think in fairness i saw jim the night before yeah this ain't gonna happen  i have a meeting tomorrow with the people who are trying to kill me i should have known that was 
[01:51:30]  a sign yeah you did say you couldn't yeah i said it's uh you've had a nice adventure man it was a  nice adventure yeah and then you went away for how long 33 days so now i'm fixed yeah i've totally  everything is totally good i'm gonna go back to just uh using drugs recreationally yeah yeah just uh  in small doses just a little bit for fun brings me out of my shell a little bit that's what you do  makes you a more fun person it's more fun do you talk about this on stage not yet because i'm uh  you know because i stink and i'm the least prolific person alive but uh i should you gotta 
[01:52:00]  work it into your act i gotta find the other funny angles yeah well yeah it's pretty just it's  just tragic now it's at this point it's still just kind of sad machine coming after that i get  another couple months i get another couple months under my belt and then i'll start thinking  everything's okay yeah is that the worst than building recovery stuff into your act and then  going back out you're like what do i do well that's that's what happened to me like i was  doing this whole thing where i'd pick like the oldest lady in the crowd and you know and say  like let's talk about something we could all relate to it i go well you know like you you know when  you're snorting crystal meth off a switchblade in an after-hours bar and you think man i'm gonna 
[01:52:30]  be late for work and realize it's it's noon and you were fired three weeks ago and and then like  then but then you start using again and it's like not it's not quite as funny anymore yeah because it's  true wow the worst thing i had happen by far also was i was in a limo and i'd been up again for a long time and  and uh and they they sent the limo to go do this gig and uh and it picked me up way up in harlem which  was a nice touch getting out into a stretch limo 145th and so i get into the limo and i'm freaking 
[01:53:00]  out now full-blown freak out mode so i close the divider and i'm crying and i'm rolling around on  the ground of the limo and i'm thrashing around it was like a three-hour drive a two and a half hour  wow and i'm like just losing it and i'm still getting you know messed up or whatever and i get there  and i realized that i'd only close the shading thing like the glass bar wasn't enough oh no  the glass bar wasn't up the driver looked at me like he just saw the most grizzly monster ever  getting out of the back  have a nice show sir for hours he's just watching you writhing around on the floor and crying 
[01:53:30]  that's bad it was bad and during this whole time that lewis black show that i was doing that the  root of all evils airing and i never watched it i had no idea you know and and and i'd be out places  people you know people would have it on or whatever but it had been taped so much earlier  it was like this whole other lifetime ago it was just i heard you did really well with that show i  didn't personally see it but uh you got some nice reviews i think so i you know i didn't i really was  out of touch and then i left right when it was airing most of the time so so i don't know uh 
[01:54:00]  i don't know how i think i mean they picked it up for 10 more so i think it went okay did that have  uh something to do with the relationship your um no no uh it was uh she was encouraging me to keep  keep going that was the one thing that was keeping us together the second that came out  of my mouth i'm like no right that's the dumbest thing i could say are you gonna get back together  with her or is that right now or is that too personal no no it's not i you know personal at  this point what do we yeah right what's personal yeah no at this point it's in the work so uh we'll 
[01:54:30]  see how it all shakes out it's been a very it's been a really rough uh you know and obviously there's  kids i mean we're joking around about it but you know it's brutal it's really an ugly thing but now it's all uh  it's all coming back together and you know one day at a time right  and i don't know what it is at least he's honest about the whole thing because is it with comics i  love the fact that you could go away for 30 days and everyone just looks at you like all right you've  got to be fixed now yeah yeah well people really think that you know i know i've heard people say oh  i went to some meetings it didn't work uh that's not how it works yeah it didn't take and then there 
[01:55:00]  are some people who go for a long time it doesn't help 18 years four months and two hours  you get it i in my body by the grace i haven't found it necessary  it's stupid just looking for that love he never got as a kid oh it's awful from strangers in  between laughs is it the lifestyle of of comedians because you guys are in clubs every night you're  traveling around the country it's it's an odd lifestyle or is it the fact that uh what makes 
[01:55:30]  you a comedian this this weird insecurity i need people to i need to be the center of attention  uh does that kind of make you get into doing drugs it's both you know because it's it's if you're  predisposed i put it this way you guys would be enormous crackheads i guarantee oh please if you  didn't have to get up every day and go you can't actually hold the job it becomes a combination you  know like they say you know genetic predisposition plus exposure so you you know you you start out 
[01:56:00]  insecure freaked out nervous all these kind of things and then you you expose yourself to being  constantly on the road constantly on stage you know constantly around a lot of fat girls  one thing is going to lead to another we're in a life where it's accepted like right like  gerald if he or any other comic comes in like blown out of their mind you might go did you see greg  last night yeah all right i'm gonna eat falafel like nobody cares they're so useful with each  other that it's no but you care because you love the guy but you mean you don't judge him like he's  how could he do it right we all get it but there's so many of you that don't do that anymore 
[01:56:30]  we have one comedian that does our show i don't know one guy that drinks a beer or or a recreational  drug yeah oh no there are there are there are a few here and there that don't you know that don't  drink at all and it may be a tell all right you know a tell oh you care a tell's actually not uh  not not drinking much these days all right yeah not drinking much these days everyone has  something they all have whether whether it's uh it's drinking it's drugs it's food every every 
[01:57:00]  comic seems to have something seinfeld i don't know well but i can't find what no seinfeld is  the perfect community the only guy that can flip a Porsche and have it be uneventful  apparently i scratch my car we have to do a quick break here because we're really late uh  greg giraldo who's not going to see him this weekend at comics two shows tonight two shows tomorrow  uh west 14th street just east of ninth avenue for tickets two one two five two four twenty five 
[01:57:30]  hundred opian anthony wow greg giraldo is entertaining the hell out of us during the break it's the opian  anthony show greg giraldo playing comics here in new york city tonight and tomorrow night uh that's a  great club c-o-m-i-x for showtimes and ticket info but uh you had like medical issues with your with  your substance abuse or whatever all the drinking and everything and at one point i uh you know i  tried to stop and i had like two days without drinking and i guess all that stuff leaving your  system or whatever happened i started getting this pain in my side like i was being stabbed to death 
[01:58:00]  and uh and i was on a plane i couldn't move it was just the most excruciating pain so finally i ended  up in an emergency room at like one in the morning and uh and i said to the guy some of the best  customers are in there at that hour and then the nurses are so sweet to everybody they're just like  do you speak english do you speak english and that you know yeah it's all the homeless guys  screaming i'm in pain i need more pain medication really like i had all my stuff i put it in a bag  i was sleeping i had my shoes everything under my back and uh and the the doctor the guys they  have great bedside manner at that point too this guy comes over and he says you know he starts to 
[01:58:30]  ask me about drugs and alcohol and i said well you know i don't want i want this all off the record  because i need to get a bigger life insurance policy uh and he goes life insurance he goes this  he's feeling my side he goes this feels like severe pancreatitis which means you'll be dead in six months  i don't care i don't know well really thank you doctor wow diagnosis and then i just stayed for  about like 20 something hours and they they took all these cat scans and then they they turned out  it was uh it was just my kidney and oh that's all i got another one yeah i figured you know literally i  thought and they said you know and i thought that's the moment you know like i i i you know i think i'm 
[01:59:00]  dead and now i have a new lease on life and i and i just have to call the doctors and surgeons on monday  and they said never drink again you'll lose a kidney and of course that you know that helped me for like  three days i never called the doctors i started drinking again i went around the clock again for the next  the next two and a half months so i still got to get that resolved wow but how do you do that  you know that's a commitment yeah that's a commitment to drinking i really had committed  in a way to finishing you know to being done you know to saying okay well what do i got to do to  finally give up you know i don't know what it's going to take but the problem is once you start  going in these crazy cycles then it becomes like a you start lying to yourself you start thinking oh 
[01:59:30]  people would be better off without you know all this kind of which is probably try to rationalize just  drinking and yeah drugging in a way like hey if i'm dead it's not really that big a deal bad  no it's it's uh yeah it gets it gets uh it gets bad fast but you know um you'll be happy to know  that the uh beth israel medical center does take after insurance jim okay there you go pay five  percent yeah no there's uh no copay or anything it's pretty good it's a good spot to go that's good 
[02:00:00]  alcohol and drug-induced kidney uh explosion you should head down there did you did you ever worry  and and i think with a lot of comics because uh like we said before a lot of them have got to get  off of every type of substance that they were on at some point uh do you worry that that's where your  funny came from that like i can't be funny without drinking not anymore i used to think that but i mean  i've been trying it's that you know so i'd get long stretches that's probably why you don't you  know you don't notice it because i'd have long stretches of sobriety and stuff because you know 
[02:00:30]  five years ago four years ago is when i first started and then i would drink all the time then  and yeah i'd be drunk on stage all the time and i thought how am i going to do this without it but  for the last four years i've been for the most part you know sober and then when i when i slip  up it gets it's a disaster so it's not like it's not like how am i going to do this you know how  can i possibly live without you know throwing up on myself and uh you know 12 hours a day it's it's  you sort of uh you know it becomes obvious that it's gotta it's gotta end you know mornings  made me a little nervous coming to morning radio because i was drinking every afternoon that we 
[02:01:00]  would do the show i would start it probably and when we come in for for show prep probably about  two o'clock start down there on the air and i would constantly have interns bringing me in beers and i  put them behind the monitor there and constantly and and then you know we got the boot and uh we  came back doing mornings i'm like i can't start drinking at five in the morning you know i really  can't and i was i was thinking to myself i'm like i'd always done afternoons and always you know  drank a few beers beforehand yeah and thought can i even do this without having a few beers and 
[02:01:30]  apparently i can't i'm really not as funny as i used to be and it's true that you have to be drunk  this drinking in the morning thing is not that big it really is this is the afternoon for you and  greg don't don't think this is gatorade then jesus don't let him kid you he's still doing the show  drunk it's just differently i was i was gonna say something going on there's there's mornings you're  still a little buzz from the night before on the night before that never really ended those are  tough uh chris cox uh a few of these coming in so i want to read this one i saw greg giraldo at the 
[02:02:00]  cellar and he became one of my favorite comics he kills absolutely and you are prolific you draw  always has new material yeah i'm kind of kidding but i gotta start cracking some no you're one of these  guys like every time uh you know i see it it's different material and then and as as someone that  really loves comedy we we appreciate that because there's some guys i don't want i don't want to start  naming names but they they come through and it's just they change maybe five minutes of their act  i'm like what are you doing yeah you try i mean i don't know i i do write a lot but then at the same 
[02:02:30]  time it seems like it's just so much you know you got you go back to these things and uh these bullets  especially when you're when you're uh not focused you know and what about the time travel thing you  were talking about oh yeah well that that kind of thing it was like when i would just start you know like  i'd have something i had to do on tuesday and it was friday night and i thought okay i can't keep it  together till then but maybe i can just drink tonight and it was friday and the next thing you  know it would be tuesday and it would be it would be morning time on tuesday like you just materialized  how did i get here it was a tuesday what's worse than checking your messages oh and realizing like 
[02:03:00]  uh the first hey you're running a few minutes later everything all right yeah oh no hey man we're all  sitting around waiting for you um where are you we're sending someone over the house you have to be  dead yeah you vaguely remember hearing a doorbell that like 30 hours ago you're like yeah oh man  well the ones where there's like messages from people and there's entire like you've had whole  relationships with like in the time that you were kind of and it's like oh hey it's mike remember we  were uh we went out on the boat yeah you really i didn't know you'd be so good at fishing for 
[02:03:30]  stripers you really wait i went fishing for stripes i don't even know what a striper is is that a fish  yeah you'd have to know you were on a boat you got to the boat you look up fishing for  stripers this is this like code word for like racist shootings  yeah there's a lot there was a lot of that kind of stuff but you know but  luckily it was just that concentrated period of time and i you know for the most part of it  you know for work stuff i'd pull it together and then but you know again there were times when 
[02:04:00]  you know i look back at so many of my second half hour special this was years ago on comedy central i  was wasted out of my mind and it doesn't even look like it you know i watch it and you know  yeah now with all that you you know the video and youtube and everything it sucks because people  everything's on camera phones there's stuff that that pops up there there's an interview i did with  somebody uh i don't remember talking about it and i don't look that bad you know the thing that  seems like i'm pretty functional yeah and i don't remember and you know i was trashing people  i don't i mean i don't even remember having this conversation a certain amount of pride in that 
[02:04:30]  drink like a mother and just like people have no clue you're completely ripped yeah but that starts  changing you know well yeah of course it does what an amazing thing though to do a 30 minute film  special yeah loaded oh yeah that's but that's the business it's like people like oh that's cool man  it looks great oh yeah tons of those shows and that is why in the business you get away with  it i mean i remember being on the road once thinking like you know i'm starting to worry about  this was six or seven years ago and i was starting to think god i think man can i be an alcoholic like  i didn't but i didn't think so i just thought you know i behave like one i certainly seem like one 
[02:05:00]  but i'm not you know i'm just doing that on purpose i'm acting you know i'm behaving like  an alcoholic but i could stop but i'd start freaking out because you know you go on the road you're in  those places for a week and and uh you know you're in these like the same hotel the condos with all  the comics and you're just going nuts for a week around the clock and i remember laying there  with these guys going like you know but i know but i'm still functional you know i'm still  functioning it was like 7 30 at night i'm still laying in bed you know it's like it's easy to be functional when you  don't have to work till eight o'clock you're just laying in bed i'm functioning yeah we're the  remote watch look i'll change the channel i'm still gonna make it to work eight o'clock at night 
[02:05:30]  yeah you get there you're on autopilot for what 45 minutes an hour and then that's all you got to  that's it you know your maintenance drink through the set and then you then wow i don't know how you  guys the lifestyle really is a big part of it then obviously the predisposition for it but then  the lifestyle really kicks it in just constantly you know and then also all the others you know  that's everything about this business that drives you nuts you know i mean yeah yeah there's a bunch  of you know comics who just hearing their name is a relapse trigger for me doesn't want to have a 
[02:06:00]  drink when some names come up every time there's a new show coming on the air you hear this guy's got  a new show you just you know son of a bitch where's my dealer's number so should we update you on  what's been going on in the world or you're just we might have a black president you know that right  oh man we already have the governor isn't enough enough you like the blind governor  we love the blind governor here like the blind governor  i like that right before he's blind and i never got past the first part 
[02:06:30]  yeah what else has been happening i see uh i heard you guys were very newsy this morning it was  good a little newsy brought all the way up to speed oh we did the bush thing that was about all  we do have a story of a woman who was kept dead on a toilet for months we could do that  dead on the toilet we can leave on an up note for the week right yeah might as well on a toilet i  don't know we're gonna find out here greg giraldo in studio comics uh tonight and tomorrow oh by  the way ron bennington if ron's listening there's no one better for xm unmasked than giraldo no one  yeah perfect oh you haven't done a mask yet no no i should definitely do that great yeah and 
[02:07:00]  ronnie's great man ronnie is just the best because you're open about it you don't yeah yeah  no there's no point at this point yeah it's very interesting and believe me ronnie will  commiserate ronnie's been there yeah yeah he's been there all right here's uh the woman's story  toilet dead duno county sheriff's deputy doing a welfare check discovered the body of a 90 year  old woman she was left in the bathroom of the home she shared with another family well it turns out  that the woman had apparently been dead for months but was left there in the home now according to 
[02:07:30]  investigators the family tried praying over her in hopes that she would come back to life  on the toilet oh my god wow oh my god her last dump oh man praying over her on the toilet hoping  she'd come back to life when her jawbone dropped off into her lap didn't they think maybe this ain't  gonna work what about the smell my god it's the bathroom it's supposed to come back to life neighbors 
[02:08:00]  aren't really as shocked as you'd think they say the circumstances behind the discovery of the body  is zombies but they've had a feeling that something was wrong for a while now the body of 90 year old  magdalene albina middlesworth was found in this home in the town of nesita middlesworth shared the  home with 35 year old tammy lewis and her two children according to the criminal complaint lewis was helping  middlesworth put on clothing when she passed out in her arms she told police she stopped the elderly  woman on the toilet in the bathroom and called her superior alan boucher a man also known as bishop 
[02:08:30]  john peter who told lewis that praying over the body would bring it back to life then he had a good  laugh with everyone else in the room wow  but this happened for months i hope it was a two-bathroom home yeah that's what i was  that's a little odd having to sit on granny's lap well you gotta tip the old bag off real quick  proper back on if you're early if you're praying over dead body i think you only have one bathroom 
[02:09:00]  hmm yeah you know a multi-bathroom no i don't think you uh danny what do you got is this this  actually was a one bedroom uh one bathroom rather and uh i don't know if it's in the story but the  family and the kids had to use buckets because the this woman was on this granny was on there for a  while wow i like that the that the neighbors think it's not as surprising as you'd think  these people were always praying over dead bodies people are dying in the bathrooms there all the time 
[02:09:30]  it's not really a big deal but even after the strange discovery of middlesworth's body  both neighbors say they're not surprised my husband and i mentioned about them maybe three weeks ago i  said that we hadn't seen the grandma or the kids out for at least two three months i bet she's on the  toilet dead kind of an uneasy feeling about it all when i saw the police down there and after seeing the  yellow tape up you know i made a comment my wife or maybe something happened with the grandmother 
[02:10:00]  sure enough wow kreskin thank you captain obvious you wait until the the cops in there and the tape  yeah they're from like uh where are they from up north like uh milwaukee or something like that oh  that's a good accent to find oh it smells like poo oh no i didn't know oh no like police showed up  and the tape was there and i didn't know no no no no i went in to take a poop  grandmother sure enough that was the case both lewis lewis and boucher have been charged with two 
[02:10:30]  counts of causing mental harm to a child since her death investigators say lewis and boucher were  cashing millsworth social security checks for a religious group that they belong to more charges  could come from that and after an autopsy report determines how millsworth died all right you got a  little scam going on keep grammy uh make believe she's still alive to get the uh the welfare checks  coming in yeah that's obviously what's going on not this praying zombie thing how much how much could 
[02:11:00]  they have been getting though to make using buckets while there's a cadaver on the toilet worth it  there's some equity in actually being able to use your toilet yeah it had to be a huge disability  check what were they they were getting uh welfare benefits from her yeah yeah 550 a month all right  that's that's a lot of money she's actually kind of sexy to go she what she's got crazy eyes oh she's  okay which one's the girl the one on the right or the left that's hard to tell that girl hey we got 
[02:11:30]  to end this side of the show but before we do uh dirk put together a little jill slash anthony uh  uh tmz type uh thing here a tmz type thing yeah greg if you don't know um i've been following the  saga oh yeah i have okay yeah it's exciting traffic girl 11 excited known that she's single and uh  interested in anthony i'll tell you i'll tell you one there is gonna be a phone call a private phone  call there and there will be some kind of uh get together in the future you know i always hope the

[02:21:00]  your friend was trying out for the olympics or the junior olympics or something and uh you said that  he wasn't going to make it and if he did make it that he would you would let him take a dump on your  chest jesus where on earth did you hear that uh a friend of mine claims he went to school with you  know with a friend of yours from springfield college and the friend of you know was doing  the junior olympics thing said that he came out you know he said he was supposed to do this whole uh 
[02:21:30]  you know try out for the olympics and you said that you would you would uh let him take a dump  on your chest if he actually made it for the junior olympics wow that's that's fascinating you know  what i i did go to springfield college but i uh last time i checked that's in uh that's in  springfield mass not not cleveland ohio oh yeah but interesting story though interesting story  i think i actually lost that bet yeah we wish that that was a true story but no yeah i love how people 
[02:22:00]  can only ask you that over the phone too this guy would never come up to you in person and go  didn't you bet that someone could dump on your chest like as your big hand goes over his face  and just squishes it yeah you know what i got a feeling it's gonna be a good one that's a great  opening phone call well yeah we got an instant feedback is this true cena used to walk uh around  the second floor of alumni hall nude all the time at springfield that is absolutely true with nothing  but a football helmet on all right well helmet nice that is nice touch and the reason just uh just to 
[02:22:30]  stir things up you know it was a high traffic area a lot of the uh a lot of the uh football players  would uh bring the girls over i was you know alumni halls where they store either the uh veteran  football players or the freshman football players so uh just trying to make impact man just trying to  do what i can do must have uh must have been proud then to be able to walk around like that just ask  him anthony you know what jeez  joe's dance 
[02:23:00]  uh let's see how to matt in canada matt what's up guys hey hey uh anthony in honor of your big  uh triumph yesterday i whacked off to jill nickleane pictures all day long you son of a  bitch see if that's how you know he's got feelings for if he's defending you like that  yeah damn it was just a goop he wouldn't care so much yeah it's true but get rid of it you know  what anthony tell her to get rid of those victoria's secret bikinis and look at wickedweasel.com  and those are some real bikinis check those out yeah because victoria's secret ones are so unsexy 
[02:23:30]  yeah wickedweasel how far could they possibly go exactly yeah well it's probably not all chicks  oh well there you go ramp it up now john we should get the big uh you know plug in here for for uh  for sunday right that'd be awesome yeah what are you oh you're facing jbl yeah  didn't even know that old rivalry renewed oh yeah jbl rock he what did he come in here he came in with 
[02:24:00]  some boner juice last yeah yeah what was it it's called mama juana mama juana he was hilarious yeah  he's got boner juice and i think someone tried it out and it definitely worked yeah he uh  he's now involved in boner juice yeah he's a very confusing guy because in wrestling he was a badass  obviously yeah and then he did the stock thing on cnbc used to be the drinker with the short hair and  the suits and now he's doing boner juice like who's the real jbl he's the loud mouth 
[02:24:30]  texan new york stockbroker boner juice guy who can drink beer and fight  and what's the big uh beef uh the big beef is old rivalry renewed i mean the last time uh me and john  mixed it up we were covered in each other's blood yeah a famous judgment day i quit match as a matter  of fact all right back yeah so uh this could be the beginning of uh of some rough and tough stuff john  is actually one of those guys who really legitimately beats the tar out of you and uh i'm not known for  being uh light in the hands either so it's it's going to be so there's some no yeah i'm actually 
[02:25:00]  kind of looking forward to this so there's some real uh blows going absolutely absolutely i'm confused  though if it's a i quit match how are you guys able to well no this this time is actually not an  i quit match and the the stipulation for an i quit match is you fight until one person says they quit  gotcha just for that specific match right i thought you meant you had to like leave the business by no  means is a loser leaves town so that's a whole different stipulation loser leaves town is a  loser leaves town they never really i quit matches and i quit matches they never leave town for good  because then there's some kind of weird angle that is taken or they come back under a mask or something 
[02:25:30]  like that yeah and then and then the mask comes off and someone makes a surprise face you gotta really  sell it like who the hell are you of course i never leave town don't people behind the scenes  check who you are before they let you in the ring no you just need a mask and you're gonna  walk on arena security you walk into the mask i'm here to wrestle who are you i can't say  i'm most certainly not the person who lost the leaves town  because that would be wrong jimmy he's got to bring some sense to the whole thing 
[02:26:00]  what about checking his credentials  what is this contest you're promoting too we should get this out yeah yeah this is actually uh this is  pretty big i'm reading it for the first time uh partnership with gillette to host the gillette  fusion search for the next phenom yes yes this is actually um the beginning of uh my partnership  with gillette they uh have kind of deemed me the good will ambassador of this search for the next  phenom deal they do it kind of at arenas across america they're setting up shop at the prudential 
[02:26:30]  center for uh red sox game on saturday or no uh i believe yeah it is it is saturday and um yes  it is the people come and they get to download their videos to youtube if you can't do it at  the event but you basically got 30 seconds to do your most impressive trick with a ball  and uh gillette actually provides the balls take that for what you want to but uh you know if we  can supply the balls or we can have that but it's just do that just one of those deals where you uh you  know you show your talent and you got a chance to win 30 grand very cool there's only so much you  can do i mean you can bounce it on your nose or i guess like a basketball spinner yeah no it's any any 
[02:27:00]  ball like uh i got a pretty good skill with a wiffle ball but the example they use is tiger woods  bouncing the golf ball on the head of a golf driver okay just something unique that's not necessarily  like uh everyday sportish you know ping pong balls your palm or some other thailand some other  talents with a ping pong ball can also be accepted you know the story behind the tiger woods thing  no he was doing that between takes just to like entertain the crew and then they ended up using 
[02:27:30]  that as they ended up using it yeah him bouncing the ball on the driver like he did and then hitting  it perfect yeah 250 300 yards whatever he did yeah it's just beyond me they had another commercial  they were actually filming and in between takes he was just around doing and came up with the  commercial on the spot isn't that amazing yeah so you uh are you a judas priest fan yeah yeah a  little bit a little bit howford's a big fan of yours yeah yeah oh right on no no that's not bad  reason actually ride on no he is i wanted to see the mckay rock they were interviewed and there's a 
[02:28:00]  big that carbon cut out of you and oh yeah you got the pictures of him looking at your yeah there it  is yeah i bet you i bet he's a bigger fan now that he heard that dump on the chest story  i believe in the dream  how far is a big fan am i correct yeah all right cool yeah confirmed by eric oh it's cool  enough back in the day we used to get these uh stand-ups of you guys wrestling and stuff and uh  we had this guy crazy jim at aaf he would he would put his cock and balls through the crotch of those 
[02:28:30]  things and cut a hole in and pull his junk through and walk around with it and go hey how you doing  guys the wwe glory hole yeah who was it back then do you remember which wrestler was he's just i don't  think china yeah right funny one you better have a big dick  yeah but he would walk through the door and we're like what are you doing and you know no one's going 
[02:29:00]  to just look down at a cross at the stand-up and then he would get our attention to look down and  he had everything like pushed through the damn car he had to point before you noticed the cock and  balls hanging through yeah because he would also cut the mouth out though and he put his lips through  and talk so you're looking at his lips going all right that's kind of funny it looks like the  thing's talking you know oh my god that's a pretty cool joke and it says a lot about uh radio because  he was the top sales guy yeah this wasn't an intern or anything this was the sales guy that was  supposed to this guy you know keep it straight laced or whatever uh we we started by talking about 
[02:29:30]  the audio of the guy the girl yeah yeah the kick in the nuts we got this uh danny's got it no backing off  now just stay like that it won't hurt as much yes just like that and oh oh i'm satisfied  oh i heard that we don't we don't have to do any post sound nothing i heard no no we don't even have 
[02:30:00]  that was great that guy got drilled that amazing and the guy went down yeah he did like a ton of  bricks that video is somewhere on youtube i believe uh and and also you're starring in 12 rounds yeah  we just wrapped that movie uh so you're going to be leaving wrestling soon it's obvious absolutely  not you're going to be following oh man i can't the same course that rock did no rock said the same  thing too you know yeah i know i know it's tough because he's set the bar like okay you use wrestling to  go to the movies i um i dig the gig too much man that's really this honestly um this is the second movie i've 
[02:30:30]  done and i certainly do enjoy doing the movie making but there's nothing like being out there  in front of the live crowd man and there's i just enjoy the life you know i enjoy bouncing around  every town i whatever the wwe embodies i i dig it man i dig it too much wait till he gets offered a  hundred million a picture yeah that's true but i've also i've also found i've also found that you can  balance the both you know wwe works primarily on weekends you know uh monday nights is an exception but uh  movies are pretty much a nine to five gig you know monday through friday now what's uh 12 rounds about 
[02:31:00]  12 rounds is um kind of uh born identity die hard in new york-esque it's uh filmed in new orleans  uh basically beat cop catches world's greatest bad guy by mistake world's greatest bad guy then breaks  out of prison to send beat cop through 12 rounds or challenges through the city of new orleans to kind of  stay alive and uh hopefully uh he kidnaps my my girl and uh it's one of those deals the chicks are  always getting in the way they are always really careful with the traffic well yeah she could be 
[02:31:30]  taken hostage and i'll have to go with my many guns throughout the five rooms finding her she'll  be able to suggest the uh the least congested routes for the kidnapper yeah yeah you might want  to avoid you don't want to get on at 86th street i can tell you right now how come movie heroes never  date fat girls that the hero is happy to have out of their lives let's just keep her good take her who  cares he's got your woman really good i'll be at the bar and bring her back i dare you to call her a 
[02:32:00]  pig and throw her down the stairs let's say hi to big papa in alabama big papa hey boys what's  happening hey man hanging out with john cena today oh that's awesome john cena how we doing man i'm doing  good big papa how you doing man good man big fan big fan man what's on your mind i i just uh i was  one of the extras down there when you destroyed that tiki bar down there going through the french  quarter with the fire truck yeah yeah we drew we drove a fire truck uh towards the tail end of  a french quarter through a through an open bar it was pretty cool yeah man that was that was awesome 
[02:32:30]  it's it's always good to be the be the big old star making millions of dollars you could just  destroy stuff i hit something with my truck big get me a 500 damn ticket down there it's all the  cost wait you were an extra in the movie what'd you do i would just we were just sitting at the  bar right he's something and we had to run away when he destroyed it run you had to run away just  in time yes just in the middle of time you're one of those guys let's have a margarita there's a  fire truck coming meaningless stuff the coca stuff yeah right on cool all right big papa i'll see you 
[02:33:00]  now yeah there you go happy to get a sag card there you go how's new orleans look now is it fixed up  at all you know what it actually is is extremely uh it's a great time it is i i don't want to say  it is what it used to be because there still are a lot of areas that need development but it certainly  is bounced back and the people the indigenous population are extremely proud to to now still  be there in new orleans we had a bunch of fun man i was there for about four months and uh  that that place wore me out yeah you're like the tourist areas are all like rebuilt absolutely 
[02:33:30]  really nice and then there's some areas that well they know the tourists aren't going  there yeah they got that french quarter back in shape immediately did they not get down and  rebuild it or no no no it is it is how it was french quarter didn't take as big a hit as uh  just a lot of water damage but yeah they got a lot of water damage yep i think that was it for them  yeah there's some areas i don't think they'll ever ever rebuild yeah plow it under but it's  certainly alive and kicking man there's definitely good times to be had down there i'm thinking a lot 
[02:34:00]  about new orleans because brad pitt got that tattoo of the levy on his back and i mean brad and angelina  wherever they are i am yeah two assholes the levy system uh we got prime time sam roberts prime  time uh prime time's gotta have a few uh pertinent questions you gotta ask the wrestling this is  prime time uh sam he uh he wrestles too by the way i don't wrestle yet well what do you do you kind of  i saw you wait there's a picture of you heading toward the ring high-fiving people yeah why don't you 
[02:34:30]  just show john cena some of your moves because you know you were cocky and you you messed up  somebody else's match you were supposed to be a manager you got in there and did a couple moves  you got a strict managerial role now on the way to the ring is that it yeah the only move that i have  would be the low blow he did the really yes you know the move they give the chicks yeah the one  they give the girls yeah very effective but a feminine move yeah but yeah and then also getting  punched in the face yeah that works that's my other move that works a lot you should incorporate  your afro into some type of uh move where you put it in their face and then they they over dramatically 
[02:35:00]  grab their eyes like your hair is like it's sandpaper yeah yeah yeah before you ask your  question now we a lot of the wrestling sites listen to the opium anthem show and when someone like cena is  on they're all listening they're ready to blog oh yeah so you got to ask him a question that puts  him in a weird position because then he's got to say something and then and if you ask a bad  question if you ask like a stereotypical question certainly not only i get ripped apart by the  wrestling sites all the time so that's a given but now you will be thrown to the wolves so choose your 
[02:35:30]  words wisely prime prime samurai we're looking for the the google alert today because you come up with  something good um okay then the question will be you're off to a good start uh promising okay  does it frustrate you that the fans because john cena is a good guy i'd like to think i'm a decent  guy yeah i think so too a baby face right that's what they call that's what they call them in the  business but for some reason especially with like east coast crowds like new york and philly the cool 
[02:36:00]  thing quote unquote cool i don't agree with it is for i like your moxie kid yeah all the the male fans  just boo him unmercifully yes is that a frustrating thing when you're trying to not at all i think uh  it's it's one of the great things about us wwe especially the fact that uh monday night raw is on  live tv because uh you as a good guy or as a guy who doesn't do anything against the rules you know  it's supposed to be a baby face in the business yeah right um it it is a unique crowd it's like uh 
[02:36:30]  you don't know and it's not just east coast crowd it's it's primarily crowds that uh it's everywhere  i've been overseas and it's one of those things where you can go out the tunnel one night and they  cheer for you go out the tunnel one night and they boo you it's it totally gives you awareness of  what's going on i can never really plan anything i can never really have anything predetermined i  actually it's it's it's very much like a stand-up routine you have to go out there and and uh see the  audience that you're given and just adapt to that but if any of is there ever been a fan that says 
[02:37:00]  something to you that just got under your skin like that's the one thing called absolutely everything  in the book i have i have there have been fuck you seen a chance throughout arenas cena sucks you  can't wrestle you name it i've got it like at the hall of fame banquet in chicago uh it was supposed  to be a memoriam to the late eddie guerrero like he was the one who's being honored i inducted william  the refrigerator perry that night to a resounding 7 000 people saying fuck you cena at a memoriam for  eddie guerrero that's that's where i'm at so i honestly believe it or not i enjoy it i think it makes 
[02:37:30]  our program awesome to watch and it actually it's gotten like uh for lack of a better term that  tastes great less filling chant going where you have the let's go cena cena sucks because you know  all like you said all the the male demographic is telling me to go to hell where the kids and the  parents and everybody are kind of behind me so i think it it makes for a unique rivalry and and you  know when you get that many crazy people in that you know that type of environment it makes for some  awesome stuff and he's not gonna answer that question by the way well i'm sure there was one thing that 
[02:38:00]  somebody said like it really did get to him but why would he admit that no no that's all he's gonna  hear well the thing is like uh if if it's if it's in the ring like you got to take anything in the  ring with a grain of salt because that's pretty much people pay a ticket and wwe grants them a  license to pretty much do whatever they want if i see somebody at a gas station and they tell me to  to fuck off then i'm gonna i'm gonna give him a follow-up a follow-up but usually nine out of  ten times i like that a lot every every guy who's telling me to fuck off you know if i'm stopping for 
[02:38:30]  gas or for whatever or i see him at a restaurant they'll say hey man i can't you know i'm not  exactly you're not exactly my favorite but uh you know good job and then right i never i never get  that confrontation outside the ring now uh on the screens in studio we got uh time time sam roberts  say he's supposed to just be the manager watching the uh the match well technically for this i was  a special guest judge for a special boxer versus wrestler match yes scoring points and he really  dressed uh the part he uh decided to wear pretty much what he's wearing right now his regular clothes 
[02:39:00]  but i had a blazer on over a hoodie and some sunglasses on which means business that means business  all right we're gonna push play because he's supposed to be the special guest judge or whatever  sunglasses always oh no is that you creeping in creeping in under the rope shows your space  wisely i see and watch oh man the chick move you know there it is there's a little trash talk a  little gafaga now what are you doing you're too small to be doing this he tried to pick him up and 
[02:39:30]  now he's smiling you're not supposed to smile no i was happy about it because pete gas of the mean  street posse had larry barnes up there and we were in cahoots the whole time the whole time wow  wow who saw that coming no not this way that's not like that no and now sam is in the ring  awkwardly trying to figure out what he should be doing well you just kind of you didn't know what  to do with your arms did you you know there's a big move and then you stuck your chest out and then  you were like if you'll notice the referee kind of came in while we were still in the ring as 
[02:40:00]  opposed to coming in yeah he may have been in cahoots with you guys as well there he is just watching  the whole shenanigans go on doing nothing disqualified just he's lost control of it at that point  he's just walking around the ring well there's a possibility that the referee might have come  out too early it didn't make the whole thing didn't make any sense he just walked away  anticlimactically like you're out no you can see i was smiling it was a maniacal smile it was  all laugh very evil very evil and then what happens to you don't don't you get it's coming all right 
[02:40:30]  yeah you don't want to spoil it yeah i don't want to miss now he's outside the ring  cheering on what happens now well now i'm cheering on is that a randy savage macho man t-shirt you have  on no larry sweeney sweet and sour made uh t-shirts that look exactly like the old macho  man t-shirts but they say all right on behalf of wwe we'll be expecting our license i just wore the  shirt i didn't make it please sue prime time it would bring us such joy i would love to see prime  time get sued now who's who's the dude up in the white suit who's that guy in the white suit up in 
[02:41:00]  the ring i've been talking to the official that's uh john mealy who runs the new york state wrestling  federation and is he in cahoots with the bad guys or yes he's also he's an evil oh okay i don't  know where i got that from for your cause there right all right during the week he's a plumber but  all right now sam's back into the ring there john yeah and planning another attack are you  right what are you doing  he's doing the peepee dance are you just hanging out in when you try to it looks like 
[02:41:30]  you wait we gotta explain that because this is radio what was he doing he was doing sort of a uh  like he had to take a whiz dance yes like a little kid from one foot to another just  impatiently very what was that about when you're trying to do so this is why you can't hire like  old men who don't know anything about wrestling to be referees because when you're trying to do  something behind the referee's back it's near impossible when the referee insists on uh consistently  turning around and staring at you and seeing that you're there oh i got you you're really trash talking 
[02:42:00]  the ref no no he's a good guy look at you trying to constantly hide behind the wrap he moves yeah  yeah he moves he didn't have to hide he didn't care that you were there no he didn't he's he  should have he didn't care and look at you and now you're right in front of him and now he's just  you walk right in front of him well at that point i said obviously he doesn't care it's anarchy  he's fucking tapping the ref watch what i do you're moving around like like a cartoon cat burglar  he's trying to be sneaky like bludo blutarski going into kill the horse yeah oh sam but the 
[02:42:30]  fans in the back of the fever pitch oh wow he's a professional boxer there you go there you go  you got knocked out cold are you going to go on time goes down no not from you don't get up from  something like yeah you're not going to get up from that all right he knocked out everybody there  you go that video is up on uh youtube under what yeah and it seems like the uh it seems like  time gets his chiclets dusted yes prime time sam roberts uh and uh let me read some comments  wf debut yes girl down let me see it got five stars though well it's a good video you're as bad 
[02:43:00]  at wrestling as you are on the air which is since i'm good on the air i must be a good wrestler thank  you very much i like how you can hear sam's girl laughing when he gets hit already can you stay out of  the ring sir uh who is sam stupid question and linger longer yeah oh man how many comments to the  the video not many comments but uh they're speechless hopefully now if if the wrestling boards are 
[02:43:30]  listening they'll go up and then give you an honest evaluation of your performance which i do  yeah i thought was top notch oh thank you very much wow you got a future your your lurking was  top notch your your lurking your evil mysteriousness was just spot on from a man who knows you got a  future kid i think we're strapping the rocketeer back next week we're doing all the way to the  moon with this great thank you wow why are there uh why are there more people in the ring than in  the audience no that was that was a drawback but that's okay it was a good crowd it was at the 
[02:44:00]  new york high school it was a big draw for this it was it was a good it was like probably 700 people  there yes new row high school they must all be there they must all be sitting behind the camera  the one guy with the hockey helmet on yeah cheering let's say hi to daryl in north carolina he's got a  question for cena uh daryl what's up hey man i need a huge favor okay what can i do for you i got a  i got a five-year-old kid we went to see you at the barlow center in greenville okay i got him the 
[02:44:30]  championship belt the spinning belt the wristbands the headband he won't take the off okay i'd like  to i i would actually like to replace the word with quality john cena merchandise  available now bye bye bye  continue  so what's the deal what do you need what can i do he won't listen to me dude he won't pick up  his room he won't nothing i need you he's gonna listen when he gets home from school 
[02:45:00]  just tell him to start listening to me please so what you need john cena to help his father be a man  yeah yeah which essentially this is i mean i don't want to cut it down to brass tacks but this is where  we're at what is his name preston preston yes sir all right hey preston listen i'm doing this because  your old man won't you got to straighten up your room it's it's the basis of an organized successful  regime here if you're plotting to take over the world and i know you are you got to make sure the 
[02:45:30]  room is clean first and if it's not you certainly won't get any more quality john cena merchandise  that's available on wwe shop now bye bye bye so preston because there's some new gear coming out i  promise you the new t-shirt is to die for you're going to want one and you won't be able to get  one if your room is dirty so straighten up keep the room good and that's from you to me all right  thanks right on john cena selling merch being a role model at the same time uh we got mike in uh  michigan you said that's from you to me yeah well it's one of those reverse things

[02:50:30]  yeah yeah thank you prime time was deon sanders nickname right right well i think it was my  nickname first what it might have been crazy that's a debate it might have been you're just like deon  your hair looks like a football helmet without a face mask  or something so you got that going for you and you are lazy okay  i'm kidding  he has a gun no  great you're all though still hanging with him now uh sam's got a john cena story slash yeah 
[02:51:00]  what do you got well because eric and we went down for wrestlemania weekend to orlando  and eric had every picture that he ever took with a wrestler printed before we left and so the whole  weekend he was just walking around with all his wrestling pictures trying to get him signed  and so we went to the wrestlemania pre-party that they did for like business partners or whatever  yes and uh and john cena stopped by for like just a second just to say what's up to everybody  but he had to get out of there because there's like probably a hundred more people in there 
[02:51:30]  people it wasn't the thing it was the fact that that was the day of wrestlemania yes  and so he couldn't stop and sign for everybody so he's trying to tunnel out and there's a line  and he's signing for like little kids and stuff so eric saw this and he grabs this little kid  away from his mom yes you did come in jefferson oh god where is eric and he just goes he just goes  trust me trust me no no no i didn't just grab the kid away from his mom no i was standing there and  this little spanish lady is crying because her son wasn't getting close enough oh you're on the hero 
[02:52:00]  now no no it wasn't here well a little but so she's crying that her son can't get close enough to get  his uh shirt signed uh by john so i go i'll i'll help you i pick the kid up and i put him on my  shoulder and what was in your other hand oh i'm getting to that okay so um i put i i hold the kid  above everybody in front of john i go john can you sign his shirt so john takes the sharpie and signs  his shirt and as he's finishing uh finishing signing john uh the kid's shirt i slipped my photo of john and 
[02:52:30]  me from the last time he was on the show and he signed that too so you used  you dirty bastard yeah he stole a small child i seized an opportunity why would you do that  he you know he was going to come back eventually yeah why are you going to bother him in public  what's wrong with you he gets excited yeah i wasn't i wasn't thinking he also had the steak martini  thing that yes that you guys were doing away at uh wrestlemania it was steak mashed potatoes and gravy 
[02:53:00]  and gravy in a martini glass and you're right he was just downing them yeah there was a line it  wasn't just me but they were delicious right on thank you i wish that kid would have taken a dump  on your shoulder could be worse to what's on there now anybody in the audience have a question for  uh questions comments john cena before sold out crowd who came up with uh half a hulk face wow  half hulk face you gotta come no get up get up yeah looks like someone john hit we love have a

[02:54:30]  injury again tore my pec and uh what does that entail that entails uh going in uh with an incision  moving moving your shoulder over drilling holes in your bone taking the pec tendon and kind of  weaving some medical rope inside to get it all uh all tightened up they can't do that oh yeah no i'm  i'm 100 man i'm good can they do that with your jaw  a little more involved yeah yeah i hear you there but uh yeah that's pretty cool it's like an old 
[02:55:00]  school yeah it's very pixelated the old school 8-bit nintendo type yeah yeah it's very it's definitely  different and so i just wanted to come yeah everybody's doing like the um affliction type  of stuff now all of our guys didn't have to say affliction they're on that oh jeez everybody's uh  for lack of a better term i mean everybody's doing this scare teenage girls type of stuff  yeah yeah so i just wanted to go with something but thanks man thanks for giving the respect  i appreciate it that's it that's all you had yeah that's it all right

[03:00:30]  the spinners for his son where can i buy one that is a that is a commodity that i don't even know is  still for sale um sam you want to give up i think prime time sam roberts might have yeah if prime  time's got one in the stash that he wants to give up let's say sam i'm the champ i need my belt  it's for his little kid if i watch if the kid can beat me it is for a kid he's gotta beat me he  wants the kid to fight him yeah okay if the kid can beat me for the belt he can have the belt  that would be great if the kid kicked your ass 
[03:01:00]  at the traveling show last year he definitely could kick the  shit out of you oh man wow tell the kid to come anytime i'm ready  all right is this your trash talking yes because it sucks it also sucks yeah all right  all right let's bring the kid one more before we get you out of here uh christina um are you  what what was your favorite match my favorite match that's a question that people ask me all  the time and uh this is that means that's a really bad question no no but sounds sounds corny as hell but 
[03:01:30]  my brad and angelina my uh my answer is  thank you my answer is always the next one i certainly do uh do love what i do and i'm  every every chance i get to go down that tunnel is a good one that was a bad question clever answer  though he didn't answer it exactly it's like hey it's the next one that's right what if the next one  like totally sucks and you're like and it'll be the next one it wasn't the next one the next one after  that it was always another show roland do we have to get him out of here or what what are the  the suits are nodding in corporate agreement roland's like here we can bring the suits in for a 
[03:02:00]  second again they know oh no here come the suits i want a big boo from the audience when they enter  yeah they're walking here for less than ten percent here are the guys  you guys can do better than that come on give them hell  that was a very good corporate welcome get over there casual casual joe  fuck you shoot fuck you shoot so where are you guys off to now uh we're going to a space uh down 
[03:02:30]  in chelsea yes to do uh do an event with gillette very important stuff for gillette oh that's the  ball thing no no this is this is actually a pretty decent uh scenario for gillette they're doing like  a product release are you doing a commercial or anything um the commercial is soon to follow but  this is just kind of a release to the general media you must have shaved real carefully this morning  i am i'm nice and close but you don't want to cut yourself like oh shit if i cut myself  i'm gonna lose this endorsement yeah toilet paper stuck 
[03:03:00]  you should show up like that of course the suit guy wouldn't find it funny yeah  well no i wouldn't just tissue paper all over your face all right yeah bye gillette  yeah and he's you got the strong jaw they picked the right guy didn't they i think it works  i think half a hulk face could sell half a razor  we love half a hulk face yeah he used to hate when we made fun of him but now he's  he's he's all right yeah he wants to shave he has to use google map 
[03:03:30]  that was terrible what's the best brand of razor to slit your wrists with don't answer that  yeah yeah don't answer that yeah geraldo's been in a dark place for a long time  he's he's back to reality so he finally decided to give life a shot so we're proud of him  give life a shot i met a guy who actually tried to slit his wrist with with one of those i won't  say gillette because i don't know if they uh technically that's not 
[03:04:00]  it's not a disposable razor that splashes like it didn't it didn't really work well you can't get  deep with those with those disposables but it's baby smooth it just leaves it vibrated it vibrates  the vibrating one yeah what's bob backland doing bob backland i don't know hmm that was the worst  question you could have asked no but a little a little random i'm just not i'm sure he's doing  something i'm sure he's actually doing something i just don't know what it is what about ivan putzky  uh i don't know what the polish hammer is up to i don't know what the polish hammer sam knows 
[03:04:30]  he loved onions remember that sam's just smiling at this yeah i know i'm i'm one of the one i'm one  of the in guys like sam looks and he actually nodded and smiled at hope for that question like i know  being a wrestler myself i know these guys yeah any last question any last you know this is like i said  you've already you're going to get killed by all the wrestling boards this is a chance to redeem  yourself something good they're not going to write about this interview you're going to get a little  okay all right sam ask him how big is you know i'm not going to ask you no no wait a second no 
[03:05:00]  because i asked mcfoley that once and you guys made fun of me for it okay um good thought out  question yes you heard that uh mcfoley fed him steak right what happened he doesn't like steak so he  but he loves wrestling you don't like steak yeah what's wrong exactly you like wrestling what the  what the hell so we had mcfoley uh feed him steak one day yeah it killed an hour was like a little  baby no it wasn't good no i don't know if you got a future kid oh all right okay protein remember 
[03:05:30]  a couple months ago couple months ago there was all this heat on you on the internet for now for  those who don't know to find the word heat oh uh people were bashing you say yes on the internet  negative negative vibe for for a quote that you said about the rock something about this is  developing into a good question right they were all saying that john cena had some quote that that  they used that said that cena said the rock didn't have dedication to the business or something like  that i don't have the exact quote in front of me yes can you explain the scenario or whether that was 
[03:06:00]  taken out of context oh if it's on the media it's completely taken out of context but uh the message  was actually uh pretty pretty well spoken i uh people brought up you know with the movies even you  said yourself okay when are you leaving the gig and when i say never they always say okay yeah that's  what the rock said and i really truly do have a ton of passion for what i do like good bad or  different i don't care if people boo or cheer me i'm just i really do enjoy the live audience feel  of wwe i think there's nothing like it and uh my beef with the rock was he was a guy who would 
[03:06:30]  before he'd made the transition and always wanted to be an actor i firmly do believe that that's what  he wanted to do but while he was in wrestling and uh acting as well he's like oh i'm never leaving  the business i have you know dedication and passion for the business apparently he he doesn't because he  would be able to make both of them work and that was my main beat i don't i don't like when somebody  goes out and says i have passion for the business and then jump ship because it makes my job harder  like when i tell you i'll find a way to make it work you're like yeah yeah whatever when they back  a dump truck of money for your house and you're never going to see the ring again like i'll find a 
[03:07:00]  way to make it work but i can't get anyone to believe that very similar to like the drug question  people ask okay what's the steroid deal i can never defend myself in a light that would make it  believable because people have preconceived notions about okay the people before him did this so he's  going to follow suit the rock jump ship to movies so i'm going to jump ship to movies it's not going  to happen you know why i know you uh you're not on steroids or were on steroids it's it's a very  simple thing a lot of you guys have gotten a lot smaller in the last few years and you're the same 
[03:07:30]  fucking size the same size the same as it ever was man and i'm not gonna name names but a few guys i'm  like wow they obviously no prime time sam roberts got a lot smaller but you see you but it's it was  obvious to me if a few of these guys got a lot smaller you've seen it across all platforms i think  every every sports outlet you've seen and you're the same size so unless you're completely nuts and  you've been the same since people were dumping on my chest in college bring it right around i'll tell  you one guy though that never changed was uh mark mcguire he looked the same when he was playing as he 
[03:08:00]  did testifying in front of congress that's amazing holy shit all of a sudden he was harry potter  sitting and talking to congress this guy had fucking arms i know the uh i know the suits  are giving me the dagger eyes i just want to take that last yeah if you got if you got a call let  him come in but this is a good one just okay go ahead and this uh robert really fast because uh  cena really has to go hey john hello yes hey uh i just want to tell you thank you my nephew had a 
[03:08:30]  uh cancer and uh and he had done that make a wish foundation yeah he wanted to meet you and you  come down and met him down there and uh it really meant a lot to him i thought i just want to call  and tell you thanks and i really appreciate it no that's that's very cool to hear that man i'm  extremely active with make a wish i think that's an awesome charity i'm confused you wrestled the  cancer kid oh what oh my god i'm not quite in prime time status yeah i would do it and i'll kick  his ass for the belt i'll beat any of them thanks for the call robert all right we got to get john 
[03:09:00]  cena out guys guys this sunday night on pay-per-view cena will be facing jbl and 12 rounds that's down  the road rounds down the road and of course i get the gillette guys are with me so i got to plug  gillette please go out and buy a bunch of gillette products they're great the razors honestly will  vibrate on your wrists they won't draw any blood it's good stuff go out and uh and good and  gillette's launching a bunch of products hopefully uh this afternoon so you'll find out more about  that as as it comes along gillette fusion search for the next phenom contest okay you got it going  down all right guys i'll try not to be a stranger i'm sorry it's been so long between business anytime

[03:24:30]  that was his rationale i'm fun to hang out with but to pursue anything else would be like boy are you  deluded wow not fun to hang out with but to think like oh i just want to be friends get that out of  your mouth i'll tell you what happened he was gonna he's gonna have sex with you realize that  you would actually do that he's you'd be a blabber mouth and decided against this right i'm glad i  have a mouth i'm glad i never got back there i my fucking spot would have been blown because believe 
[03:25:00]  me i would have my dick out the first time you came to the comedy center oh come on you have my  pictures on there oh my god well you'd like to show off your cleavage yeah you have nice bosoms yeah you  got bosoms well what you have to look at the pictures to see that yeah well yeah because you're  not showing them no you're sheila shy oh like now the conversation's gone to my my tits yes nick said  they would nick was right yeah so i can't so give us a quick flash and then we'll be done with you  a quick wow i'll show you my hiney you show me it's not it's not wednesday i'm not going to do that 
[03:25:30]  god it's working out whenever let's show him no no since you guys are like you must know i'm gonna  actually do that oh not at all but just because just because it'd be fun to do it's not famous it's  just i'll show you my ass yeah i don't know if iraq asks no but see you've shown your ass on plenty  of occasions see exactly i'm a team player with you it's all about being selfish it's about you and  your tits and your career how about you i show my tits once i can never get a job are you out of your  mind no disrespect to jill nicolini she was naked and playboy she's the fucking hey hey hey hey 
[03:26:00]  i'm just saying that's not cool how do you think girls get jobs yeah oh no how many stations is  mother theresa on everyone knows terry was a goer but she wouldn't show anything and your about me  section on myspace is a picture of your tits lady yeah and you hold on you hold on you owe it to nick  because uh matt lamb very good observation from new york city writes perhaps this bit shouldn't be 
[03:26:30]  hold on uh mentioning that a radio dj took her underage ass out for drinks  oh wow what are they gonna do like now we got a situation yeah have you ever been to exhibit a  before that's right where'd you go i don't actually to be honest i don't remember he just kind of had  it where'd you go let's close the bar down too yeah he just kind of had some beer in the car  yeah thanks to you guys i'm never gonna get to talk to him again i bet he put on a hat with the 
[03:27:00]  fucking the two beer cans in it and she drank out of one he drank out of the other and he railed her  get uh get uh the k-rock uh request line let's call him back  do you have big nipples or small you can tell me what's who cares to be okay you remember that bit  that you did on one night stand with uh meeting women and you were talking about like you're kind of  girl yeah like that that's exactly what i am every one of those things i am you know syphilis  you're a tranny you said you were jim's type nice everyone huh yes 
[03:27:30]  minus the stds but yeah i don't know you're kind of annoying all the listeners so i think you got to  turn this around by flashing you do uh you do everything though like like because i'm speaking  for for jimmy and his i really i can't i can't talk about this no no i mean like like which  pulverize me and then it's like no no no with jimmy and stuff because jimmy you know everything i mean  you know the the pussy the ass the titfuck the blowjobs the shitting the pissing you know the 
[03:28:00]  spitting in the mouth spitting in the mouth spitting on the dick no i'm pretty normal are you submissive  licking the balls licking the ass when the when the mood strikes and when the person actually can  take care of me then yeah are you more dominant um i mean like it depends on the person that i'm with  to be honest yeah i'm sorry i never got back to him it wasn't to be rude oh well whatever  missed opportunity there jimmy no we don't have to have missed opportunity why can't we hang out 
[03:28:30]  some other time now you're cock blocking iraq iraq's face he's staring off at his face shaking  his head just thinking of the hell he's gonna have to deal with later iraq so i heard you're myspace  and uh girls on on my exactly just in case anything was missed spell it out to a t and she said the  word twice you're myspace and girls and then she realized on myspace well that would make sense all
