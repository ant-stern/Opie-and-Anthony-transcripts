<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a highly critical discussion of the Democratic National Convention.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton skewered various speeches, mocking John Kerry's "reporting for duty" line,  Biden's perceived intoxication, and Jennifer Granholm's car-themed metaphors.  The hosts also debated the political implications of Obama's killing of Bin Laden, the state of American politics, and the concurrent VMAs.  The segment was liberally laced with profanity, vulgar jokes, and impressions, including an extended Forrest Gump imitation. An advertisement for an Elvis impersonator at a Holiday Inn was also aired.

The show then shifted to the 2012 Presidential election, specifically the conventions. Unemployment numbers under different presidents were discussed, with criticism levied at the Republican convention's lack of concrete policy proposals. Obama's acceptance speech ("I accept your nomination") was analyzed, and the hosts speculated on what would have happened had he declined.  The discussion included strong, offensive language and mockery of Bob Dole’s pen-holding technique.  The conversation expanded to cover gas prices, energy policy, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and the perceived dishonesty of both candidates.

A significant portion focused on a heated debate about race relations in America, employing highly offensive and racially charged language.  The hosts discussed historical injustices, racial bias, and the challenges of achieving racial equality.  Listener calls, including one describing a harrowing incident of racial violence in the 1950s Georgia, were featured.  The discussion also touched upon media bias and the hosts' negative opinions of both liberal and conservative news outlets.  The segment continued with a discussion centering on race and crime statistics in the black community, spurred by Anthony's comments about perceived hypocrisy and double standards.  A caller, Reggie, shared a personal anecdote of police brutality, leading to a heated debate about systemic issues versus individual responsibility.  Guest Stunt Brain shared his DNC experiences, including a delegate's desire to kill Mitt Romney.  This segment also included a brief discussion about Guy Fieri.


Guy Fieri appeared as a guest, promoting his new restaurant. The studio was marked by banter and insults between the hosts, Fieri, and the "angry intern" (a producer/on-air host). Roland's underwhelming Madonna concert experience triggered a point-based argument between Sam Roberts and the intern, interspersed with apologies. Fieri cooked steaks, providing commentary while the arguments continued.  A running gag involved a potentially violent "Cuban" member of Fieri's team.  The conversation included a recounting of a "fake" invitation to Fieri, various insults, details of Fieri's restaurant, and anecdotes about his work injuries, including a severely cut thumb.  Discussions about Fieri's appearance on Rachel vs. Guy, a hypothetical visit to Fieri's home, and his wine-making were also included.  This discussion continued in a later segment, with Fieri recounting childhood anecdotes (including pig butchering), and discussions of a planned California trip involving shooting guns and visiting vineyards and honey farms, as well as humorous fan encounters.  Regular caller Ira unexpectedly joined, discussing the weather and his gambling habits. The segment concluded with promotional plugs. Post-show discussion included commentary on the segment with Fieri, cleanup, Ira's appearance, and a show intern's t-shirts and a co-host's tattoo.  Sam Roberts also recounted an incident where he vomited after eating Fieri's food and was subsequently given spiked water by Fieri.

Finally, the show featured the cast of "The Inbetweeners," promoting their film.  The conversation covered the show's popularity in England, its American release, the film's plot, and the cast's careers and experiences, including one guest's recent fatherhood and another's dissatisfaction with his career.   Discussions covered the show's low budget, marketing challenges, and the actors’ pay ($15,000 for the first season). The show concluded with promotion of the film and social media, mentioning Harry Styles' retweet.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent. 
[00:00:30]  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Woo!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And conventions burn to the ground.  Would you like romance?  I'm about to be the second.  Wow!  With O.B.  The Destroyer.  Hey, asshole.  Just take the joke and take a little beating.  It'll be okay.  Anthony.  The Rage.  Wow!  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rat down the fucking  hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock if it's there?  I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the O.B. 
[00:01:30]  and Anthony Show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Hi.  Friday.  Friday.  I was trying to do my Menino.  Just can't control the voice.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Yeah, yeah.  Here in Boffeston.  Yeah. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  I just want to play Menino audio.  That was the highlight of my day yesterday.  Just listening to him stumbling through that speech.  They should have gave him prime time.  Yeah.  Prime time.  Nah, he didn't get prime time, that's for sure.  You had John Kerry.  You had Joe Biden.  And the president of the United States of America.  Reporting for duty.  How was John Kerry?  I think he's such a tool.  Frankensteiny motherfucker. 
[00:02:30]  Wasn't bad.  It's all...  Nobody wasn't...  They were all all right last night.  It really is, unless you're Menino, hard to bomb in front of a crowd that you can do no wrong in front of.  You know?  I mean, and believe me, I'm talking both parties here.  Republican convention and then this Democratic one.  It's just the same speeches over and over.  It's amazing how insulting it is to have the same fucking facts, as they call them, just pounded into people's heads. 
[00:03:00]  It's like a brainwashing session.  And you wait for the other side to go, well, that's not right.  Yeah.  But they're not allowed to, because it's a glorified pep rally.  You know?  Yeah, it's always the move forward and 4.5 million new jobs.  Nice.  It killed Bin Laden.  Nice.  It's just all the same.  And then the next speaker gets up.  Don't forget, save the auto industry.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  Yeah, save the auto industry.  And, oh, boy, it was, I did learn a lot, though, from watching it and tweeting at the same time, that this country is doomed and completely divided amongst economic, political, and racial lines. 
[00:03:30]  Who did that?  Me?  Oh, who did that?  I think you're right.  Who did that?  Why has it gotten so bad?  I don't know.  It was getting bad.  Let me, let me think.  It's always been there.  Sure.  I mean, you're always going to have one party bashing the other. 
[00:04:00]  But if you look back to even Reagan, you did have the parties working together in some way, shape, or form.  And you did have the losing party of that election kind of going, yeah, all right, you know, we had Jimmy Carter in there.  What do you expect?  Of course, the Republicans are going to win after that debacle.  But now it's just, you know, I honestly think if Obama did lose, there would be suicides on that side. 
[00:04:30]  Just watching these people looking at him like a Jesus-like figure.  They really look at him as a messiah.  Wow.  That can absolutely do no wrong.  I mean, you point out certain things.  We've heard this 4.5 million job thing over and over again.  They've been pushing that like, well, the Republicans tell us that there's no jobs.  Well, Obama made 4.5 million jobs.  And then they don't talk about the 4.2 million that were lost over the same time for a net of 300,000 jobs over the course of it, which is nothing. 
[00:05:00]  And the jobs aren't the quality jobs that were lost.  You're replacing them with a lot of just entry-level shitty jobs.  But if you just listen to that without knowing anything, you're like, wow, Obama, 4.5 million fucking jobs.  When it's not, no.  But they kept going up and pounding it into people's heads. 
[00:05:30]  But then you look at the other side and Romney has a plan.  Look.  We just don't know what the plan is.  Yeah.  And believe me, I was tweeting for the Republican.  Babbling idiots.  There was no plan either last night.  He told us what he was going to do.  Not even what he was going to do.  He basically told America that it's a work in progress.  He goes, look what I did.  It's a work in progress.  Obviously, you know, I was in a tough spot when I took off, took this job, and I'm going to need another four years to complete everything.  He tied a Rambo headband around his head, went over to fucking Pakistan, and just slit bin Laden's throat all by himself. 
[00:06:00]  Then came back on Air Force One.  That was a ballsy move.  It wasn't a ballsy move.  It was a ballsy move.  No, it wasn't.  It was a ballsy move.  No, I will totally disagree with that.  Any president, any sitting president that got the information that he got would have said, go ahead.  Any single one.  You know what, though?  Yes.  Biden said last night I was sitting right next to him the whole time, and man, it was a ballsy move.  Any sitting president would have said, yes, go, go, go, get him. 
[00:06:30]  I think that any sitting president, but he didn't, he had risks he had to take with that.  That's a president.  But any sitting president might have used those bunker busters.  They might not have gone right in and put soldiers on the ground to retrieve it and to get his family.  He went in and got everybody.  Maybe bunker busters would have also worked.  They would have gone around to the various body parts and tested them and found out, yes, it is indeed him.  But it wasn't this bold, how the fuck, ten years later, after 9-11, are we looking at a president that killed bin Laden and going, what a ballsy move. 
[00:07:00]  Anyone would have done it.  Not necessarily.  Not going into an ally's ally.  Pakistan has turned out to be a little shaky as far as an ally goes after all these years.  You're looking at going in and getting the number one most wanted criminal ever, ever.  It's not a ballsy move. 
[00:07:30]  Look, I'm giving the administration the credit it is due.  He did do it.  I mean, he gave the order and the troops went in and did what they needed to do.  So I'm giving him credit that he was the sitting president during that time.  Does it bother you that it happened on his watch?  Like, you can't fucking believe.  No, the truth of the matter is, it's not that ballsy a move.  I think it was.  Only because the risk in a first time, in a first term, the risk, if they knew 100% it was him, I would agree with you. 
[00:08:00]  I would completely agree with you.  They knew quite well.  They had a good idea.  They had an idea, but he was being advised by people to not go.  People were saying, no, it's a 40% chance it's him.  Of course there's going to be people saying, no, you got your doves and your hawks in the White House.  He went in.  If he didn't go in, or say it wasn't Bin Laden, or he wasn't there, and he killed a few people.  And let's say that helicopter, which did go down, killed some troops.  That's the end of his president.  Like, he has no shot at a re-election.  But that's the risk.  That's the risk that you take as a president. 
[00:08:30]  And I believe any president would take that risk for the upside of you being able to say you killed Bin Laden, the number one most wanted fucker on the face of the earth since Hitler.  Carter tried it, and it cost him a second term because he was seen as bumbling.  And I'm not saying that nobody would have wanted to kill him.  I just think certain guys would not have gone with it not being 100%, especially in Pakistan. 
[00:09:00]  He was not in Afghanistan like a lot of people thought.  But that's even, you say, you know, an ally.  That's even easier than what Carter did, sending helicopters into a hostile country.  If something goes awry and you're in Pakistan, you're in Pakistan.  You could run away and go somewhere fucking safe.  It's not like they were landing.  And believe me, I'm not demeaning what these guys did.  I'm just saying that any president, you have fucking Bin Laden there. 
[00:09:30]  You have him there.  What president is saying, nah?  Because I'm telling you, every president doesn't behave that way.  Reagan was seen, and justifiably so, as a very brave guy and a guy who they were afraid of.  No nonsense.  Because he sent bombs to Gaddafi's house and killed, missed him, but killed one of his kids.  And you didn't hear a peep out of Gaddafi.  Right.  But nobody said any president would have done that. 
[00:10:00]  Like, it was one of those things where he made the right move, and I gave him credit for it.  I always loved the fact that he fucking went after Gaddafi like that.  Yeah.  And I liked the fact that Obama went in.  Because I read a huge account on it, and it was like, it was pretty much, they kind of knew it was him.  They had a pretty good idea.  But they didn't know for sure.  They had plenty of false leads before over the years.  For ten years they had false leads.  But this was one of the best leads they had.  And again, and here's another thing, and it's speculation, so I'm presenting it as that, 
[00:10:30]  so don't jump down my fucking throat that it's speculation.  Do you don't think the White House had a distancing plan for themselves if things went south?  You don't think it just would have been another one of these military operations that,  well, this guy knew and that guy, but, yeah, Obama gave the order, but it really was this military operation.  There would have been a distancing between the White House and the actual mission if things went south.  Garen fucking teed.  This wasn't as big. 
[00:11:00]  All I'm saying is it's not that big a risk for a president, and it's not a move that any other president would have made.  Do you think George W. Bush would have made that if he would have gotten the information that Obama got?  Didn't Bush at one point, like, I don't know if he would have or not.  Of course Bush would have went after him.  But if it was Pakistan, which is a very, and again, ally in quotes, a very delicate balance, because they hate us.  The whole country is filled with Islamic radicals who don't like us, or a lot of them are radicals. 
[00:11:30]  They have a different mentality.  The government, at one point, it was Musharraf, was the only thing that liked us.  They have a nuclear power, so we have to be very careful how we handle them.  So I don't know what Bush would have done, because the risk at failing, if it's wrong,  or if Pakistan feels like you've humiliated us and conducted this operation in our country without consulting us,  you've now alienated completely a nuclear ally who is a country filled with Muslims, who does not like us.  And didn't Bush have a chance to eliminate bin Laden? 
[00:12:00]  He might have early on, I think.  They tried, and yeah.  I know Clinton passed it up, but that was before 9-9.  Well, that was in the 90s, right?  Well, they beat the shit out of Tora Bora when he was there, but he got away,  and that was this fucking political bullshit that was going on at the time.  So Obama sucks for taking out bin Laden, I guess?  No, no, I never said that.  He kind of sucks.  I'm just saying that he was there as president during his death, and that's a great thing for him. 
[00:12:30]  I mean, they used the shit out of it last night during the convention.  They used the shit out of it, which rightly so, you know?  Fair is fair.  Yes.  But I'm just saying that it isn't this amazing, fantastic, he parachuted in himself and choked  him out like they're presenting it during the fucking convention.  Would Romney take the shot?  Yeah, as indecisive as Romney is, I guess absolutely not.  I say absolutely not. 
[00:13:00]  I don't know, but I think he would have.  Absolutely not.  I don't know about that.  My opinion on him is because, again, I said the other day he's such a numbers cruncher  and he's just one of those guys.  He has zero foreign policy experience.  They should have just told him the House was an American corporation.  He'd have busted it apart with a bomb and put...  Bush once said bin Laden was no longer a priority.  I no longer think about him.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That wasn't a good thing to say.  Okay.  I agree with that. 
[00:13:30]  And it was because the trail went completely cold, completely cold.  And there were people looking, but, again, Pakistan, our great ally, was absolutely protecting  him.  Yeah, of course they were.  Absolutely protecting him.  The trail went cold until somebody finally realized, hey, this is a, you know, got a heads  up from somebody that his courier was, they knew who bin Laden's courier was.  So they followed this motherfucker and found that house that he was going to. 
[00:14:00]  The courier ended up getting fucking waxed, too.  I'm sure he did.  Yeah.  You said if Obama wins, a lot of people are going to cry.  Are you going to be one of those?  No, I said if he loses, a lot of people are going to kill themselves.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  But if he wins, are you going to cry?  Yeah, I'll be in tears.  No, you know what?  The Republicans and Romney supporters, if Obama wins, will be very disappointed, but will  just carry on.  We'll just go on.  I think if it went the other way, there would be massive problems for a while in this country. 
[00:14:30]  What do you mean problems?  I think there would be racial problems in this country based on what I see as far as this  unwavering blind support by blacks for Obama.  This absolute blind faith and following that is going on with black people for Obama is  really amazing.  It's the most racist thing I've seen as far as this presidency goes, and it's other black  people.  And that's what drives you nuts. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, because I'm considered a racist.  I'm called a racist every friggin' night on Twitter.  And the most racist people are these blind supporters that are supporting Obama for no other reason  than that he is black.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm not afraid.  Oh, I'm not afraid.  I'm not saying you are.  We've got to get clips of John Kerry and Biden.  Reporting for duty.  I love that guy.  That's all I think when I see him now.  One of the worst things ever said at a convention. 
[00:15:30]  Is that the worst thing ever said at a convention?  At a convention, perhaps.  Reporting for duty.  It was one of those Dukakis tank helmet moments.  And I bet you a million people told him, do not say that.  But he had it in his head like, nope, I'm going with this one.  I know it's going to work.  Oh, reporting for duty.  Looked like an idiot.  It's one of those moments that somehow we as a public know sums up this asshole.  It's like with Dukakis and the tank helmet.  But like with some people just intuitively understand, like, that's who this guy is. 
[00:16:00]  Yes.  Reporting for duty.  He's this dork in a tank helmet.  Oh, shit.  Can we see this?  A tank helmet.  But he referenced Rocky IV last night.  Oh, he certainly did.  Can we get that clip?  We need the Rocky IV clip.  It was Kerry, right?  Not Biden?  Yes.  That was Kerry, yeah.  Biden, I think, was a little tipsy.  I think he put a few down.  I think Biden did what we do.  This monitor's off.  That's what I was trying to say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was doing Chinese eyes.  Meaning I can't see.  Yes.  Well, if Sam was working today, he would know that. 
[00:16:30]  Instead of lollygagging over there, fucking enjoying YouTube.  You know how before we go on stage up at one of our road shows, perhaps we'll pop a  couple of wobbly pops down or something like that to loosen up a little?  Well, some more than others.  Of course, of course.  Some more than others.  Sure, sure.  But I honestly think Biden did the same thing.  You think he was loosening up a little bit?  And he was a little closer to me than you as far as his intake before the gig.  I think he's one of those old school politicians where those guys fucking just...  A little whiskey?  Yeah, they tip him back, man. 
[00:17:00]  He looked a little tipsy.  I think the newer guys, they don't do that as much probably, but...  A little tipsy.  You think he had a few?  A couple?  Yeah, yeah.  I absolutely believe it.  There's something about him.  I break these guys down, just with their personalities.  There's something about Biden I just like.  I think he's...  I just like.  More of a regular joke.  And I'm not talking about policy.  Yeah.  Get him away from the public eye, and he's a regular guy who I think might tell an off-color  joke now and then.  And, I mean, I'm not the only one that was hoping he was going to go off-script last night. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, I know.  Because there's always the chance Biden will go off-script and say some crazy shit.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But he kept it between the lines last night.  Yeah.  No, we're looking for the John Kerry wrestling shit.  He has the wrestling.  The John Kerry.  Oh, okay.  Here it is.  This is reporting.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty.  He puts his hand up to salute. 
[00:18:00]  What an idiot.  And I'm...  Oh, he's like, oh, they're applauding.  I've got to get this out.  He didn't have to say it.  And he didn't have to salute.  How embarrassing is that?  One more time.  Yeah, we got to hear it.  One more time.  I love how douchey he gets.  Because he doesn't even deliver the line again.  I'm John Kerry.  And I'm reporting for duty.  And I'm...  Hold on to your hats.  Here it comes.  And in his mind, he's like, this is going to kill, man.  This is going to be great.  When did that become, like, everyone went... 
[00:18:30]  The next day?  The second he fucking put his hand up by his forehead.  Oh, yeah.  We didn't have to wait on that one.  That was like, oh, my God.  Did he just do that?  Reporting for duty.  But that's who he is.  He's just a dork.  He is a dork.  You did all right last night, no?  I dislike him.  I don't like him.  I don't like him either.  He's just a...  Who was that lady?  Oh, God.  We've got to get some audio of her as well.  With her 90s sitcom mom hairdo. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, there she is.  I've seen her before.  Yeah, Jennifer...  The Straser was your granulm.  Granulm?  Granulm.  Something like that.  DNC speech.  Highlights.  Rev up your engines.  It was all about rev up your engines.  Oh, boy.  She got everybody pretty wound up there last night.  Her delivery is so bad.  The entire auto industry and the lives of over one million hard-working Americans teetered  on the edge of collapse.  And when he made the tough call... 
[00:19:30]  Look at all the dislikes on the video.  ...and he saved the American auto industry.  Oh, I hate it.  Oh, it's so bad.  Industry.  Her arm is out.  Here she goes.  You know, Mitt Romney, he saw the same crisis, and you know what he said.  Led Detroit go bankrupt.  Now, sure, sure, Mitt Romney loves our lakes and our trees.  He loves our cars so much they even have their own elevator. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, God.  I hate this.  Chip's cracking up over here.  Chip loves her.  Well, in Romney's world, the cars get the elevator and the workers get the shaft.  Oh, is she...  Oh, Chip loves her.  Chip loves her.  She's fucking great, this lady.  She's brilliant.  You hear that shaft line?  She's hilarious, Chip.  Replay that, cocksucker.  Cocksucker.  Who does she look like? 
[00:20:30]  She looks like somebody.  I know.  She really does.  She looks like an SNL parody of SNL parody.  We did say that.  Yes.  Oh, did you say...  Yeah, maybe the mom...  Oh, that was before the show.  Sorry.  We didn't say it officially.  Oh, she looks...  I guess if it wasn't on the air, we didn't say it officially.  Right.  Never happened.  Never happened.  Or the mom from, like, Risky Business, maybe, with lighter hair.  Yeah, she definitely has a mom from a movie or sitcom look.  Oh, she was a governor.  An ex-governor.  An ex-governor.  From Michigan.  Right.  They get the elevator, you get the shaft. 
[00:21:00]  They even have their own elevator.  But the people who design and build and sell those cars...  That's right.  Well, in Romney's world, the cars get the elevator and the workers get the shaft.  Holy shit.  Holy shit, you fucking goodness lady.  Come on, get the elevators.  Get the fuck out of here.  I need a sandwich.  Take us to... 
[00:21:30]  No, no.  We just started.  Chip.  We've only been on 10 minutes or so.  Chip loves it.  I think she's amazing.  Play some more, man.  And she did that thing.  She goes, the elevator.  She's, like, putting her hand out, like, on one hand, the elevator.  On the other hand, the shaft.  You, what's annoying is when you watch this, you know she thinks, I'm fucking killing it.  No shit.  She stopped for an applause break.  And the longer the speech went on, the more dramatic she got.  Well, let's keep going.  Because she knew, like, I got this fucking crowd.  Let's keep going then, man. 
[00:22:00]  President Obama, with the auto rescue, you know, he saved more than one million American  jobs.  But it wasn't just Michigan.  Yeah.  It wasn't just Michigan, my friends.  Oh, here she goes.  In Colorado, the auto rescue saved more than 9,000 jobs.  Yes, it's dead.  In Virginia, Virginia, more than 19,000 jobs.  Look at all these jobs. 
[00:22:30]  In North Carolina, 25,000 jobs.  In Wisconsin.  She's just pointing to, what an easy way to get applause at a convention.  You just got to mention the state.  In Pennsylvania.  She's getting them all wound up.  She's so good.  Who is this guy?  Yeah, her voice starts getting it.  In Oklahoma.  In California.  In California. 
[00:23:00]  211,000 good-paying American jobs.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That was a Heil Hitler she gave right there.  Yeah, she's fucking good.  You like her, Chip?  Fuck yeah, I'm dunked.  Fuck it, I'm voting.  She's fucking good, man.  Oh, Chip found a fucking lady he likes here. 
[00:23:30]  Jennifer Groneholm or whatever her name is.  Getting her fucking fists going.  She probably added up like 10,000 jobs total or something.  Maybe a few more, Chip.  Could you play a little more of that?  Can you go back a little bit?  Yeah.  Might have something.  All right.  Somewhere around there, yeah.  All across America.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Goodness gracious.  United Auto Workers Union president to the dugout. 
[00:24:00]  He knew.  I guess there's no question.  What are we going to do with those 652,000 jobs?  John.  John.  John.  John.  Oh, she stinks.  Wow.  It's just a dumb pep rally. 
[00:24:30]  We're to rev up the engine.  Oh, it's coming.  Dramatic.  You've got to have the big finish.  This isn't even the big finish.  Oh, she winds them up.  Every speech except for Menino, who just walked off awkwardly, had the big finish.  Yeah.  They were God blessing something.  She's getting them crazy, though.  Oh, she is, Chippa.  Let's go.  Hit it.  No, I'm not saying it.  Oh, wait.  Did you hear what she just said?  What?  You know what I'm saying.  Did she just say that?  Oh, no.  Because her hands went up.  Did she just go, you know what I'm saying? 
[00:25:00]  Please tell me.  I'm just hearing that.  Why?  You know what I'm saying.  Oh, God.  I know what you're saying.  You know what I'm saying.  Yes, white lady.  You know what I'm saying.  Yeah, man.  She's feeling it.  Oh, boy.  I hate how I know she thinks she's just rocking and rolling.  She's kind of rocking and rolling, though.  You know what all these women look like and act like?  Fucking realtors. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  They look like those women realtors that get into those giant fucking Cadillacs that you  got to follow at 800 miles an hour when you're looking at houses.  Right.  Because they don't have real time for you.  Right.  Because they don't think you're a real buyer.  Exactly.  And then they got that bullshit way of talking.  And, ugh.  Right.  Shut up.  Hit it.  USA.  USA. 
[00:26:00]  USA.  USA.  USA.  USA.  USA.  USA.  USA.  USA.  USA.  USA.  USA.  Hey, man.  Got the crowd going.  Yeah.  Menino did it.  When Mitt Romney did say let Detroit go bankrupt, who took the wheel?  Barack Obama.  It's a car thing again.  She's fucking called this lady.  Take the wheel.  Get the shaft.  These are fucking car things.  Holy shit.  You like the car?  Yeah.  I didn't even know what she was doing until just now. 
[00:26:30]  It's brilliant, right, Chef?  It's fucking car stuff.  It's fucking car stuff.  It's fucking car stuff.  It's fucking car stuff.  It's fucking car stuff.  It's fucking car stuff.  It's fucking car stuff.  It's fucking car stuff.  Holy shit.  Uh-oh.  Hope she doesn't break characters.  Oh.  Another car.  Chip's admin.  We'll be back after this.  No, no, no.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  You can't just take us to break after something like that.  We got more of Jennifer Granholm to listen to.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Yeah, let's listen to a little more.  Detroit go bankrupt.  Who took the wheel?  Barack Obama.  Yeah.  When America was losing 750,000 jobs per month, who gave us a lift? 
[00:27:00]  Oh.  A lift.  A fucking car.  When American markets broke down, who jumped?  Broke down.  Jumped.  Jumped.  Barack Obama.  Yes.  I thought she was doing all kinds of, like, travel references.  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, okay.  I don't think you understand what she's doing here, Chip, and how to really do it. 
[00:27:30]  What is she doing?  She was saying he got, like, when we broke down, guess who started everything up?  Yeah, yeah.  Guess who put us in a drive shaft?  No, it's not a drive shaft.  It was an elevator shaft.  Oh.  Guess when America was in trouble, guess who drunk drove into some children?  Barack Obama.  No, no, no.  He didn't.  It was, wow.  When America was in trouble, guess who picked up a hitchhiker and raped her in the woods?  Barack Obama.  No, no, no.  See, that didn't happen.  See, Chip, you're Chip. 
[00:28:00]  Oh.  I thought she was just doing car stuff.  I'm getting another spirit.  You're pretty good.  You're good at it.  Mark, it's broke down.  Who jump-started our engine?  Barack Obama.  Barack.  And when America needed it most, who got us rolling again on the road to recovery?  Yes, roads?  America, we need to rev up our engines in your car and on your ballot.  The D is for drive forward. 
[00:28:30]  The R is for reverse.  Oh, shit.  In this election, we are driving forward.  Wait, she forgot to say the I is for, I like to vote.  And the V is for vote, and the E is for A. Get there and vote.  She forgot the other one.  What's the N for?  Oh, wow.  What?  Neutral.  Neutral.  Neutral.  We all know.  It's like the independents.  You guys jump to conclusions all the time with me.  See the cross I bear?  Yeah, boys. 
[00:29:00]  The burning one?  Carrying it to a fucking location.  Carrying it to those new homeowners.  But you weren't playing along.  You just went literal there, sir.  What?  Oh.  Yeah, well, a little more of the tail end of Jennifer.  This is the big...  Tail pipe!  A tail pipe.  A fucking dummy.  Chip, you could do this.  I know I could.  That's why I was doing it.  Oh, sorry.  This is the big finish.  Selection.  We are driving forward, not back.  Let's reelect our great president, Barack Obama. 
[00:29:30]  She's killing.  How does that rev people up?  I think she's terrible.  I think she's terrible and it sounds forced and unnatural.  It sounds so fake, doesn't it?  Yeah.  They needed some fun.  Hey, let me tell you what I think.  How does that work?  Like, driving to drive and rift to put us on a lift in the shaft.  Like, who wouldn't go like this?  They were eating it up, though.  She killed.  I mean, you're standing there for eight hours.  You need something.  Maybe.  To mix it up a little bit, maybe.  I think she's sitting there with a speech writer going,  could you put something there about lug nuts? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Something.  Yeah.  Don't put...  Say, we don't want to go in reverse.  Ah, reverse.  That's good.  Reverse.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  Car term.  They probably had a list.  A go-to list of car terms.  Car terms.  Some didn't.  Right.  Wiping away the thing.  No, it's too long.  If Mitt Romney had his way, he would lube up this country's asshole and fucking...  No.  That's no good.  No good.  It's a little harsh.  Yes.  If Mitt Romney has his way, he'll have all you people back in chains. 
[00:30:30]  Like, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  That's a winter tire reference, but it's too harsh.  Oh, boy.  Very funny.  Very good.  Let's say hi to Dave on Long Island.  He's got something about Megyn Kelly.  Who's Megyn Kelly?  Is she one of the Fox brugs?  She's a Fox...  Yeah, she does, like, the afternoon thing on Fox.  Dave, what do you got, buddy?  I got that name right, right?  It was Kelly?  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  What do you got, man?  Yeah, I don't know.  Anyway, after Clinton, she was fascinated with the fact that they didn't drop balloons, and she did the same thing three times yesterday after... 
[00:31:00]  They went with confetti instead of the balloon thing.  That's what she pointed out after Obama, but two times before with Biden and, I guess, one of the others.  So what's...  She was like, well, they're not dropping balloons today.  All right.  So what's...  She was fascinated with it.  What's...  Well, what's more fascinating?  Her saying that?  Or you calling to tell us she didn't talk about the fucking balloons? 
[00:31:30]  Who gives a shit?  I was just pointing that out.  That's all.  It was just...  It was just an observation on your part.  Out of all the things that the speeches and everything else that she could have criticized...  Look, we like...  She's wondering why they didn't drop balloons, but they were...  All right.  Enough about the balloons.  I'm guessing that they didn't drop them.  I'm guessing they didn't drop them because it's probably hard...  It's less...  It's more of a security risk to have those things in your line of vision as opposed to confetti.  Oh, very good, Jimmy.  It's a guess.  We like Secret Service Jimmy. 
[00:32:00]  We like looking for unique angles on shit, but...  Yeah.  I know...  The balloon thing is a little of a stretch.  Enough about the balloons.  Exactly.  I loved yesterday when the phones were broken.  Yeah.  Stupid Mars is back.  That means phones.  Oh.  Oh, well.  I noticed...  Oh, my God.  You noticed what?  He's still back.  Are you losing this room?  I noticed yesterday on Fox, though, that when Governor Crist, former Governor Crist from Florida was talking, they deliberately did not play anything while he was playing. 
[00:32:30]  Didn't they... Governor Crist, isn't he the one that appears to be a...  A moderate?  No.  A very gay conservative.  Is he the...  Can I see a picture of Governor Crist from Florida?  I think he's the one who...  Yeah.  I suspect strongly that he is a homosexual.  Yeah.  I have no proof.  Handsome shock of white hair.  But he's one of those anti-gay guys that I personally believe devil is.  Oh, okay.  He's trying to push something down. 
[00:33:00]  I think he's doing the old toe tap in the old lavatory.  More than...  I think he's doing the fucking...  I think he's doing the curly shuffle in the lavatory.  You think he's doing the old turn it off?  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  I saw him after signing.  I wanted to say hi to him.  I just have such shame.  I never know people...  Rory.  The guy from...  Oh, right.  Book of Mormon.  Hey, Dave, so what do you got on the balloons?  He has nothing.  What do I?  Dolt.  I said everything I was going to say about the balloons.  All right.  Enough about the balloons.  And that's all I got to say about that. 
[00:33:30]  Right?  All right, Dave.  I did what you were talking about.  Life is like a box of balloons, Forrest.  I got cancer.  Your Jenny's got AIDS.  What?  What does that mean, Mama?  It means you put a load in her, and now she comes back with her smart hairdo, Forrest,  and she marries you when she has AIDS.  Is that bad, Mama?  She's treating you like a retard, Forrest.  Yes.  I was just watching that the other day, and I'm like, what an awful human being Jenny was.  Yeah.  And how stupid fucking Forrest is. 
[00:34:00]  Lieutenant Dan, you're rich, and you married a fat Chinese lady.  But you got magic legs.  Yes.  Titanium, Forrest.  Titanium.  Titanium.  Look at this.  After that hooker shamed me in the New Year's Eve party, I got a fat Asian lady.  What a great Gary Sinise.  He's just clenching his teeth and talking.  Yeah, she shamed me for her.  She laughed at my legs.  That wouldn't work.  My CGI legs. 
[00:34:30]  Now I'm going to tap them with my cane.  Well, my fat Asian wife named Susan stands here on the space shuttle.  Yeah, Jenny just keeps running off to fuck people.  You know what it is?  She probably got on top of him when he slept and realized his big retard dick would be uncomfortable forever.  Great scene, though, when he grabs her tit and just spurts cum all over the place.  Yeah, ruin your roommate's robe.  Oh, God. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, God, what an awful person that Jenny is.  Yeah, every time he's like, I love you, and she jerks him off, teeheeheehee.  She's doing meth in a hotel room.  Runs off with another fucking hippie or disco douche.  I know.  What scene was that where you had the black guy?  Oh, that's right, everyone.  Strumming along.  Fuck, that's funny.  What else from the convention?  I can't believe I'm on a shrimp boat.  Who's a retard? 
[00:35:30]  How did this happen?  I was supposed to die in battle.  He's such a great fucking guy.  No wonder they wouldn't let you on a plane, Forrest.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you'd think of it as the real people.  My fat wife, Susan.  Susan.  Shit.  Bravo.  Oh, we need the Rocky IV moment.  Oh, right, right.  Did that make the interviews yet?  I'm sure it did, right?  He took a nice shot at Mitt Romney, not knowing much about Russia. 
[00:36:00]  Everybody was taking some shots at Romney.  Oh, that's what you did.  I brought this up earlier to you before the show, which means we never even brought it up.  That's true.  That means it never happened.  Why are the polls, because everybody's saying this is a real horse race at this point.  The poll numbers are neck and neck right now.  And if you ask the Democrats why, if you listened to that convention last night, Obama has done so much. 
[00:36:30]  So much.  He's a wonderful person that has just given the world so many wonderful things.  Given the world his gift.  Yes, his gift.  Doing such a great job.  Right.  And you've got Mitt Romney, who is the Antichrist, who has done nothing but that evil Bane building.  I just picture looking like the evil person building from an action movie.  Always in a shadow.  Shadows, always dark.  Shadowy.  Yeah, with a dark black helicopter landing on the roof.  Just a black cloud above it. 
[00:37:00]  Him getting out with a close shot to his face, and it follows him into the dark building.  He's always filmed in that gray-blue hue.  Exactly.  If that's the case, the way they presented it last night.  You're going with the bump thing?  Why aren't the polls completely 99% for the good guy and 1% for the bad, evil, horrible guy?  We don't know.  It's still early.  The polls will come out either today or tomorrow, see if he gets what they call that bump.  Even the bump isn't going to be that much.  The convention bump.  Well, Romney, they thought, should get a bigger bump, and he only got, what, 1%? 
[00:37:30]  When you figure no one's watching these conventions.  He only got 1%.  They were surprised at that.  Whose idea was it to have the VMAs also during the Obama speech when, like, the youngsters,  you want the young vote.  You want to hear, what happened?  What?  What time did Obama talk?  He spoke at about 10.30.  10.30.  It was over 10.  It was over 10?  It was.  Wait, the VMAs decided to do a quick two hours?  Yeah, they just did two hours. 
[00:38:00]  That's all the show was, is two hours?  I bet there was a reason.  I bet they didn't want to step on their guy.  I agree.  I watched the VMAs.  Kevin Hart did a pretty good job hosting, but the show in general was just a dud.  Yeah, it wasn't good this year.  There was no highlights.  Nothing.  There's nothing to talk about.  Not a thing.  Because I'm sitting there like, all right, maybe I should, you know, maybe take some notes.  There was nothing.  No.  It was like they just played their hits or whatever, and that was it.  It was so bad.  The VMAs.  As far as the show overall goes. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  No one really cares about videos anymore, so the video music awards just comes off as stupid.  No, but I mean, in past years, even last year, it was still a happening show.  Was it?  This year, something is going on.  There was a massive drop-off.  No, you're right.  Last year, there were at least some highlights.  Moments that we talked about.  There was something to talk about.  Like, you could talk about it for 20 minutes at least.  There was nothing to talk about on this show.  Oh.  Wow.  No highlights, huh? 
[00:39:00]  There was nothing spontaneous.  There was nothing cool.  I mean, there's no fucking things happening where, you know, Chris Novoselic clocking himself  in the head.  Well, that's just showing our age, maybe.  No.  To the youngsters, they loved it.  They probably loved it.  Yeah.  Maybe we're just getting too old, but I just felt like there was nothing going on with  that show last night.  By the way, Twitter people smart because we're supposed to be an outdoor event.  I mean, they just didn't have the balloons because they had moved it from outside to  inside last minute.  So there goes my dumb security theory.  Wrong.  No, I like your dumb security theory. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, but that makes more sense.  I don't know.  Thank God.  They could have got the balloons.  Because the rain and the thunder and lightning might have hurt.  Oh, that's right.  There wasn't any.  Hey, speaking of balloons, maybe we can get Dave back on the phone.  Oh.  Like when the Republicans dropped all those balloons.  Yeah.  Who the fuck blows all those up?  How do they do that?  Probably machines.  That's a big company with those machines.  I don't think there's somebody there going.  No, no.  No, I understand that.  Yeah.  But I mean, one by one, they're just putting a balloon on a tank.  There's probably a bunch of people with a bunch of tanks going. 
[00:40:00]  Holy.  How many balloons did they drop?  That number must be out there.  That'd be 10 or 20 balloons.  10 or 20 balloons.  Perhaps.  So, yeah, the VMAs, not much to talk about there.  No.  Here's John Kerry.  John Kerry.  Referencing Rocky.  Yeah.  Rocky IV, by the way, for this.  For the Drago.  Yes.  United States senators all supported President Obama's New START treaty, but not Mitt Romney. 
[00:40:30]  He's even blurted out the preposterous notion that Russia is our number one political geopolitical foe.  Folks, Sarah Palin said she could see Russia from Alaska.  Mitt Romney talks like he's only seen Russia by watching Rocky IV.  Rocky IV.  Oh, it's getting a standing ovation, though.  Oh, they love him.  I don't mind that because it's smashing him with it.  That's not that bad.  That's fine.  He smashed him. 
[00:41:00]  He's shitting on dumb Romney.  Rocky IV.  Rocky IV.  I just have trouble getting psyched about a businessman.  Can I have such a dislike for so many of them?  I have trouble getting psyched about a businessman running the country.  Yeah.  Because that guy's never going to look out for me.  Ever.  You don't think?  They never have.  When have...  Whenever...  Has a business guy looked out for you?  Dude, ever.  When have they ever been altruistic for real?  They're not.  They're just not.  And I'm not saying Obama's a saint.  I just...  I have more faith in him as a guy caring about people. 
[00:41:30]  Sometimes the country needs, like, somebody to do that for the country.  I completely agree.  I think you're right.  But I just...  I prefer a guy that has some kind of...  I'd say a little bit more experience than...  Even though Romney was a governor, I know he has more...  You're leaning Obama.  Obama didn't have any experience.  Yeah, I know.  He's a fucking...  You know...  First, he was a community organizer in Chicago.  Right.  But now he's done the job for four years.  Then a senator...  That's some experience.  It's...  He's got some experience now.  Oh, well, he certainly does. 
[00:42:00]  Romney annoys me.  Just knowing he's a big business guy.  Like, another one of these guys.  I can't wait for the debates.  Yeah.  They're going to be good.  Romney will probably be...  I mean, he's a smart guy.  He'll probably be good debates.  They're going to be good, man.  I think there's going to be some...  Some...  Some...  Fireworks.  Oh, fireworks.  I wish Obama...  I don't know.  I think it could get a little ugly.  What do you think?  I hope so.  You think they're going to keep it on the up and up, or will they get a little dirty?  They'll get a little dirty.  You think they will?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  When is the first debate? 
[00:42:30]  They start with the vice president, don't they?  Vice presidential first?  Is that the opening act?  I believe so.  Paul Ryan will probably be a tough one for Biden.  They say Biden can handle himself, though.  I'm sure he can.  They said...  Let's not forget, he kicked Sarah Palin's ass.  Oh, please.  Please.  He did.  Sarah Palin?  Who couldn't?  Gives a shit about her.  He did, though.  She was the big star, remember?  That's a fucking retard.  Yeah, she was terrible.  Jesus.  Paul Ryan will probably be a much tougher opponent.  Oh, look, the Republicans picked her as the second person, so she should have had game. 
[00:43:00]  Boy.  She had no game.  She had no game.  Then, did you ever see the movie on HBO?  And again, it may have been biased, but I think it came from somebody who ran McCain's campaign.  How is she spinning it?  It's terrible.  How is she spinning it that she wasn't invited to the convention?  Does anyone know?  How embarrassing.  She was the vice presidential candidate last year.  On a failed ticket.  And they didn't give her a spot to talk.  Wait, was McCain invited this year or no?  McCain was up there.  Was he this year?  Yeah, McCain did a little something. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, he did.  Okay.  But Palin, I mean, they didn't even give her the shitty times.  No.  They gave, like, Menino.  Oh.  I don't know.  She was a pushover as far as the debate goes.  What a horrible choice.  She was going to say, nice tits.  And it totally demoralizes her behind the podium.  But she did a better job in certain speeches than people thought she would either.  Like, when she went up there.  Talking about shoes and baking.  Yeah, exactly.  So, how do you bake a cake?  And then, you know, Biden's like, oh, I don't know. 
[00:44:00]  She's like, well, let me tell you.  See?  It's important.  It is important.  All right.  We got Obama clips.  What do you want to do with that?  Play him?  Yeah.  Sure.  Let's listen to our commander in chief.  I watched last night.  You know, people tell me, Anthony, you're an asshole.  No, they tell me I'm not informed.  I'm an ignorant person.  I get this from the left all the time. 
[00:44:30]  The fact of the matter is, I watch everything that is going on with these politicians.  I listen.  I read.  So, you could say what you want about my opinions, my point of view on things.  Um, but, uh, to say that I don't know what I'm talking about, ah, you know, I might trip  up every so often.  I'm only human.  But, uh, but the truth of the matter is, I sat and I watched, I don't know anybody else  that watched these conventions from three in the afternoon, pretty much, uh, all the 
[00:45:00]  way through, uh, on C-SPAN.  So, I wasn't getting the bias of, of, uh, Fox or of MSNBC.  I'm just watching the straight feed and listening to all the, the preliminary speakers that no  one listens to and, and seeing what's going on.  And then you get these motherfuckers that just listen to the highlights, perhaps, and  then tell you, you know, you don't know what you're talking about.  Eh, maybe I don't know all the time.  But at least I'm listening and, and watching these people and seeing what they have to  say. 
[00:45:30]  How was James Taylor?  James Taylor?  I didn't see that.  Did he speak or sing?  No, he sang.  Foo Fighters got up there and sang.  What did they sing?  The Foo Fighters.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is Obama their hero?  It was the most tamed down, uh, like, uh, uh, version I've ever heard too.  Can we hear that?  It was very mellow.  And there were people in the audience just crying.  One thing I noticed about the Democrats, they love to cry when people are up on stage  talking.  They're the sickliest group of people ever.  Everyone that got up there is either sick or knows someone that's sick. 
[00:46:00]  There looks like, uh, there's a lot of diabetes in that room.  A lot of diabetes.  Holy fuck.  There was one, fuck, did you see that one speech by the guy who was injured?  He's like, uh, wash my legs in the war.  This is my fat Asian wife.  Susan.  Titanium.  Susan.  This is Susan.  And my fat Asian wife.  I'll introduce you to my fat Asian wife.  You can't introduce me to Aidsie.  And we can both realize how we're billionaires who's truck out with chicks.  Aidsie.  Tell your wife not to hug me, Forrest. 
[00:46:30]  Forrest.  I get open wounds below.  He's kicking her away with his titanium leg.  I'll hit her with my titanium legs or my cane.  Titanium.  I love the caries in these.  Let's listen to the Foo Fighters.  All right.  Doing my hero.  This is a great song.  Yeah.  You like the Foo Fighters?  Please welcome the Foo Fighters.  Hold on.  Pause.  Come on.  You had to know the whole time that these guys lean Democrat. 
[00:47:00]  That's what you say.  You know what, though?  Kurt would never have fucking thought of doing anything like this.  Oh, you're so right.  He hated this stuff.  Yeah, but Dave Grohl enjoys the limelight a little more than Kurt.  You think?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  He's a little more of a hitster.  But most of the bands you like lean fucking Democrat.  Of course they do.  You know that.  Yeah, but, you know, you get up there and stuff.  Who are the big bands that lean Republicans?  Serenading these fucking freaks.  A lot of country acts, but how about rock acts?  Yeah, dumb country acts.  Like a Metallica.  Who are they lean? 
[00:47:30]  I'm guessing very left.  I'll tell you who leans right is Dave Mustaine-Megadeth.  Oh, right.  We know that.  That's just him.  What about Ozzy?  Ozzy, he doesn't really discuss his politics.  I think he keeps that private.  But you know him.  What do you think?  I'm going to guess more left because he's probably of the thinking,  let people do what the fuck they want.  Oh, yeah, true.  Who the fuck am I to tell you not to do that?  If you've got titanium legs, I still want you to enjoy my show. 
[00:48:00]  I enjoy your music, but my fat Asian wife doesn't.  I'm just going to go home.  Jimmy's got this covered today.  Say Susan.  That's great.  My fat Asian wife Susan.  Hey, you know, Ozzy, this is my retarded friend and his agey wife.  Why am I here at this event?  Just angry all the time.  This is with Jenny.  She's not wearing shoes, so she's tracking AIDS all over.  Don't forget about Uncle Ted. 
[00:48:30]  Uncle Ted's a boy.  We know what he's all about.  Oh, God.  You too, Democrats.  Stones, Democrats.  Most of them probably are.  Yeah.  Just about all of them.  Let's see how they sounded last night or during the day.  Foo Fighters.  Good.  Thank you very much.  Yes.  Oh, so is he a lounge singer?  Yeah, I know.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  It's an honor to be here.  And I think this song makes perfect sense here tonight. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, does it?  The house next?  Too alone now to talk about.  He sounds good.  Yeah.  He's got a great voice.  Take those pictures down.  Look at the black people like, what is this?  Yeah.  I don't know what this is.  They're trying to move to it, but they kind of can't.  Oh, they can't even move to it.  Does it kick in ever? 
[00:49:30]  No.  Oh, this should have kicked in.  It's pretty much just like this.  Yeah.  There goes my hero.  Watch him as he goes.  He sounds great.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  They're, they're.  She's probably, she's, yeah.  There goes my hero.  He's ordinary.  What's this song supposed to be about? 
[00:50:00]  Barack Obama.  Is it?  No.  I don't know.  A hero or something.  Oh.  It's, um.  I don't know why he's singing about a sandwich.  They, uh.  I think a lot of people in the audience have no clue.  They think this is probably, he wrote it for Obama.  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  They've never heard this song before.  Yeah, they never heard it.  I like the, um, very artistic fades they're doing and pullbacks. 
[00:50:30]  It's like, uh, like a music show.  Want to just play the rest of this in a break and then we'll do the Obama shit afterwards?  I guess we could do that.  Why not?  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn. 
[00:51:00]  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Thank you. 
[00:51:30]  Thank you. 
[00:52:00]  Thank you. 
[00:52:30]  There goes my hero, he's ordinary.  There goes my hero, he's ordinary. 
[00:53:00]  There goes my hero.  There goes my hero, he's ordinary.  For years, the Las Vegas Strip has played host to some of the world's best entertainers.  From the Rat Pack, the Tom Jones, and Sid Reed and Roy.  Now set your sights on a new entertainment destination.

[00:55:00]  And we will get a day.  Three sections.  Three sections.  The Opinion Trish Show.  All right, where were we? 
[00:55:30]  Obama?  I was saying it's a shame that there's a president who's younger than me, the first one, and, oh, wait a minute, maybe I said that during the break.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it did.  And Jimmy goes, say it on the air.  I'm like, no.  Yeah, you just said it's a shame there's a president younger than me who's a Democrat.  Yes, yes, Democrat.  How old is he, nine?  What?  Oh, he's 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, he's a 50-year-old guy.  And he's the president of our United States. 
[00:56:00]  And we'll see if that continues in November.  It's going to be close.  I think it'll be close.  The job numbers come out today.  Oh, boy.  Not looking good.  They're saying that unemployment is probably going to stay above eight.  Eight percent.  That's bad, huh?  After the election, yeah.  After the election?  Like, up until the election and after, yeah.  So that obviously helps Romney.  What's a good number of unemployment?  Five? 
[00:56:30]  Well, I mean...  Five would be nice.  Anything lower than fucking eight at this point.  Anything lower than eight would really help Obama.  Yeah.  But is it going to go down slightly?  Probably, right?  Maybe.  Those numbers fluctuate like our ratings.  Remember those things?  You're like, oh, we got a this or a that.  There's no rhyme or reason.  We would be rock stars, and then the next month we sucked.  Yeah.  That was dumb.  Yeah, that was always a fun fucking thing, wasn't it?  I would imagine it was somewhere in between, right?  Right.  What were Clinton's numbers? 
[00:57:00]  I don't know.  Clinton.  Bill Clinton's unemployment numbers.  Five percent?  Below five?  I think it was.  But Bush Sr.'s numbers sucked, and that's what gave Clinton a shot, remember?  The economy just sucked.  Also the read my lips.  No new taxes.  Well, yeah.  That got him.  Well, you got to do that.  That got him.  You got to tell everyone there's no new taxes.  Read my lips.  And then there were new taxes.  No new tax...  And then there were new taxes. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, that's a rough one to sell to the American people.  I know it.  You know it.  And the American people know it.  And Bob Dole.  The American people know it.  With that dumb pen.  Yeah, of course.  So his arm didn't go all willy-nilly all over town.  No purpose.  Just holding your hand in jerk-off position.  He's a war hero and all that.  Yes, he was.  He couldn't figure out something else for that hand?  Yeah.  That pen was just awkward to look at.  Yeah, it was.  Just weird.  Why are you holding it all the time?  Put something else in there.  Something else.  Well, we did that bit. 
[00:58:00]  We certainly did.  Then we went through all the things he should have had in his hand.  That he could have had in his hand.  We did that one.  Yeah.  Obama, last night.  Madam Chairwoman.  Delegates.  I accept your nomination for President of the United States.  Thank God.  I thought he would say no.  Oh, I didn't.  Reporting for duty.  I know.  I thought he would say no.  I was scared there for a second.  I give up.  Imagine?  Yeah.  After all this hullabaloo, guess what?  I'm going to go do something else. 
[00:58:30]  Imagine if he said, I've got cancer.  Oh, God.  Some bombshell announcement.  Bombshell.  What would they do in that case?  You just hear the crowd go, oh.  Everyone's crying.  Everyone's crying.  Psych.  Yay.  You know Biden would step up and just go, I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  More Obama.  Now, our friends down in Tampa at the Republican convention were more than happy to talk about  everything they think is wrong with America, but they didn't have much to say about how 
[00:59:00]  they'd make it right.  They want your vote, but they don't want you to know their plan.  Could you pause?  How about the fact that you have the job and you haven't told us what your plans are?  Whoa.  And not only told us, he has four years to enact his plans and do something.  So don't criticize the guy that's running that's saying, you know, that he's not spelling 
[00:59:30]  out his plan when, what the fuck are you doing?  They'll take care of that in the debate.  Oh, okay.  Don't worry about it.  Alrighty.  I want to play a little game.  Yeah.  I know you were losing your mind because I was following you on Twitter a little bit.  Yeah.  I want to know what part, because out of these highlights, were you just out of your fucking  mind?  Do you remember what point you were completely at your worst last night?  God, I'm trying to think.  What one thing did he say that you went, holy fuck?  That I lost my fucking shit over? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  I accept your nomination.  No, I...  You're all right in general?  I'm trying to think.  Nothing stands out?  Let me hear some of the clips.  Maybe it'll...  And that's because all they had to offer is the same prescriptions they've had for the  last 30 years.  Have a surplus?  Try a tax cut.  Deficit too high.  Try another.  Try another.  Feel the cold coming on? 
[01:00:30]  Take two tax cuts, throw back some regulations, and call us in the morning.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  Oh, shit.  Who wrote that for me, Thick?  Chip.  I don't understand what that means, because if you're sick, why would you be doing tax cutting  things?  Oh, no, no, no.  See, it was a...  Oh, boy, Chip.  If you're thick, why would you be doing tax cutting things?  Oh, God.  Wow.  That was good, though.  That was clever.  Oh, boy.  It was clever, and they liked it.  And he kills no matter what he says.  He's being put over. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  So now you have a choice between a strategy that reverses this progress or one that builds  on it.  Mm-hmm.  We've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration the last three years, and  we'll open more.  Have you?  Could you...  Really?  Really?  How about the pipeline from Canada, the Keystone Project?  How about that?  How about you didn't fucking sign up on for that one?  How about the fact that our fucking gas prices are at record highs? 
[01:01:30]  Record highs.  So don't fucking talk about energy like it's some accomplishment you're doing, because you  didn't.  There's another lie, a false accomplishment that they were just spelling out, all these  wonderful things that Obama's done, and they were all fucking bullshit.  He's talking about the future.  Clean energy.  Oh, is that it?  Okay.  Have you seen the BP commercials where they just brag about how they've paid out over  $3 billion so far?  Oh, yeah.  Holy, how much money do they make that they just could go, yep, we've paid over $3 billion 
[01:02:00]  to the Gulf and the people?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How much profit do they make?  And who gets that money?  A lot.  They make a lot.  How many people benefit from the profits of BP?  One guy, Mitt Romney.  That's it.  He pockets it all, and he uses what's left over to chop up homeless and poor people.  There you go.  But imagine being a company where you could just pay out $3 billion and it doesn't hurt 
[01:02:30]  you.  Yeah.  They fuel the world.  Is it three or is it two?  Because that's a big difference.  Either way for them.  The world runs on it.  What are you going to do?  We've all seen the commercial by now.  You know, they're partners with the Gulf, and they've paid out over, I think it's, I want  to say it's three.  It might be two.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  How many people benefit from that?  I don't know.  That work for BP?  I'm sure.  There's a few.  I'm sure there's a few.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, BP's pretty big.  Wow. 
[01:03:00]  That's a lot of fucking profit.  Yeah, it is.  Three years, and we'll open more.  But unlike my opponent, I will not let oil companies write this country's energy plan  or endanger our coastlines or collect another $4 billion in corporate welfare from our tax  tax base.  How about regular welfare?  Nice.  How about regular welfare?  A better path.  Like that.  Corporate welfare?  Oh, you mean like the fucking auto fucking, all the money you give to the auto company, 
[01:03:30]  right?  He saved the auto industry.  Oh, he did.  Yeah.  He saved jobs.  Yeah.  He did.  All right.  Uh, gas prices are not record high.  Yes, they are.  Shut up.  High, but not record high.  Shut up.  Yes, they are.  Shut up.  Randy says.  Shut up.  Randy's challenging you.  Shut up.  They are.  Shut up.  What?  Shut up.  They are.  Shut up.  Record highs.  I would say yes.  Get the fuck out, Randy.  Record highs.  Shut it.  What are we paying for a gallon of gas?  $800 a gallon.  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  I swear.  Yeah, it's crazy.  I'm going to have to get rid of my car.  Crazy.  I never noticed gas prices.  I just kind of zip in.  Fill her up and zip on it.  One percenter.  I just spill it all over the place.  Yeah, that's what I do.  I throw it on people.  Have some gas.  I'm just very wasteful when I fill up my tank.  Just throw it on me.  Yeah.  Want a little gas?  Take this home with you.  Let your wife and kids smell your gas.  No, 2008?  Oh, well.  2000 must have been hungry. 
[01:04:30]  2008 was the highest gas prices ever?  I guess.  Look, it was under his goddamn administration.  And there are some cities where it's record highs.  No, he inherited that from Bush.  Oh, he inherited.  Right, right, right.  Bush had fucking some cheap-ass gas.  He did?  Yeah.  Yep.  Record high for Labor Day.  What happened?  There you go.  Record high for Labor Day.  So you were wrong.  Record high gas prices.  You were wrong.  Record high.  You were wrong.  How are they allowed to price gouge like that?  Because we suck. 
[01:05:00]  They're just scumbags.  It's like, it's so hard.  I know they're going to make a profit, but they're just pieces of garbage.  It works on a formula.  Supply and demand.  Yeah.  People want to stick your dick in their ass deeper.  There you go.  That's the truth.  Yeah.  Do they lower the gas back down after the hurricane passed through?  No.  Why would they?  That's so shitty.  Hurricane's coming.  We got to raise the gas prices.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  It'll go down.  Oh, that's right.  It won't.  And then it kind of goes back down a little bit. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Now we have a choice.  My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy.  Oh, shit.  He's right.  He's got you there, Ed.  He's got you there.  He's got you there.  He's got you there.  What do you have to say about this one?  Like he was when he took office?  He said him and his running mate.  Smart.  Because then they can't say the same thing because Biden had a lot of foreign policy experience.  Or more enough.  And Obama certainly has a lot of experience now. 
[01:06:00]  Now he does.  He took out Osama bin Laden.  So does that mean that somebody can't go in there and do a good job?  I think not.  Probably not.  Do you really want Romney?  Come on.  You've got to be on foreign policy.  Do you really feel confident with him?  Sure.  I don't.  I don't care.  Don't even care.  John McCain I did.  I don't with Romney.  Are you going to be okay if Obama's reelected?  I was okay when he was elected.  For the most part.  I think it'll be good for the show.  That's true. 
[01:06:30]  Will you be okay though?  I don't know about that.  You know.  What are you going to do?  I'm not going to be one of these assholes.  I'm going to move.  Do any of those guys ever move?  Never.  Nope.  None of them.  Has one guy moved?  Nope.  I think I moved to Mexico.  Yeah.  He might be the only one.  Good.  Bye.  Not even full time though.  See you, Jess.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  From all that we've seen and heard, they want to take us back to an era of blustering 
[01:07:00]  and blundering that cost America so dearly.  Mm-hmm.  After all, you don't call Russia our number one enemy.  Not Al-Qaeda, Russia.  Unless you're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Who said that it was the number one energy?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What happens?  More quotes taken out of context?  No.  I don't think so.  All right. 
[01:07:30]  Who said that?  I was saying Romney said it.  Did he say it?  Go ahead.  What did Romney say?  Find it.  Romney thinks Russia is a threat?  Oh, yeah.  Look, Russia isn't the fucking wonderful democracy that, you know, that Putin's a wacky guy.  I hate your t-shirt.  What's it say?  It's the Coca-Cola logo, but it says Choke-Out Jiu-Jitsu.  Oh.  Ew.  I hope they get sued.  I hope you...  Ew. 
[01:08:00]  How about something with the Pepsi logo that says douchey on it?  Why do you have that?  By the way, you were ten steps into the studio.  It's like, he hasn't been here.  I know in days.  He sees us for mere seconds, and he just gets...  Did you just blast one?  No.  My thing is not working, though, Marce.  What is Marce doing?  What are you doing, Marce?  I'm okay.  I'm saying enough for the guy thing.  Hey, are you an Obama guy?  You're terrible.  Ah, you got you good.  He has to ride in Marce's face as he's on his knees. 
[01:08:30]  He made Marce get down and fix his headphones.  I lied.  It was working fine.  Oh, and he farted right in his face.  He set you up so bad.  I got a mouthful of that shit.  Oh, my goodness.  Are you an Obama guy?  Well, after Bill Clinton spoke the way he did, yeah, I think...  What?  You actually changed your mind based on what Clinton said?  What's wrong with that?  That was a fucking fantastic speech.  It really was.  Oh, my God.  Dude can't speak, man.  What'd you like about him?  The fucking fact that the women love him, even though he was fucking an intern and shoving 
[01:09:00]  a cigar up her twat?  You got to give him credit for that.  That's right.  I do, personally.  That shows charisma.  But then again, I'm not running for office.  People know I'm a dirtbag.  So are you an Obama guy?  Were you losing faith in Obama, and then Clinton said what he said, and now you're good?  You know, honestly, you got to give the president more than four years to fix the shit that was  there.  That's right, Marce.  You tell him.  That's the message Obama gave everyone last night.  How about that? 
[01:09:30]  That's great.  You know, there's no other president that's going to come in and fix everything within four  years.  I just don't know the president.  He speaks the truth.  Yeah, you're right.  You know that gas was $1.81 when Obama took office?  Yep.  Was it $1.81?  How about that up?  Can I go now?  How about a light at the end of the tunnel?  That's what we'd like, at least.  If I thought, if I looked at Obama's four years, first four years, and thought, all right,  look, things aren't as good as they could be.  There's still unemployment. 
[01:10:00]  The economy still sucks.  I would think like, well, but at least there's this feeling, this feeling of momentum that  we're kind of, you know, getting our shit together.  But it's just this stagnant feeling of nothingness.  I don't agree with you.  That lady said that we're revving up the engines.  So now it's time to go.  Oh, right.  Okay.  We got the momentum.  It's about to begin.  I forgot about that.  Anthony, this guy says gas prices are market-driven, not policy-driven. 
[01:10:30]  Of course.  Anthony is so ill-informed.  Until you want to bash some other political body, and then you say it is political.  And it is, of course.  The president has plenty of things he could do to bring gas prices down.  So why doesn't he?  So shut the fuck up.  Why doesn't he?  I don't know.  I'm not the president.  Wouldn't it be perfect if gas prices drop right before the election?  Well, perhaps he doesn't want to piss off the environmentalists.  It's a balancing act.  But at this point, he has, you know, no choice. 
[01:11:00]  No, it's a balancing act.  That's not his constituency.  What, people that actually fucking go to work every day and drive and have to pay for gas?  Fuck that.  The people that are going to go out and vote for him?  Stop.  Oh, let them just pay for fucking gas.  You can answer for everything.  I try.  I like it.  You might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you can't visit the Olympics.  Without insulting our closest ally.  Well, actually, Rami did do that. 
[01:11:30]  He did do that.  My opponent said that it was tragic to end the war in Iraq.  And he won't tell us how he'll end the war in Afghanistan.  Well, I have and I will.  And while my opponent would spend more money on military hardware that our Joint Chiefs don't even want,  I will use the money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work. 
[01:12:00]  Rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways because after two wars that have cost us thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars,  it's time to do some nation building right here at home.  Goodness gracious!  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen!  There you go.  There's his plan.  You said he didn't have a plan.  He laid it out.  But he might have a valid point.  I mean, he did inherit two wars. 
[01:12:30]  One is done.  We're out of Iraq.  Yeah.  And he's saying Afghanistan will be.  And I think we're going to be out of Afghanistan.  Like, how much of this mess, when it comes to a war, which is so fucking expensive,  how much of that can you blame on him?  Like, I don't believe that everything Bush did should be Obama can pass off.  But that's a big fucking, that's a big money gobbling.  It certainly is.  War is a very expensive thing.  With zero, zero benefit for us.  I see zero benefit. 
[01:13:00]  You don't think the Afghanistan...  No!  Shit, you don't think...  Zero!  Wiping out the Taliban.  We didn't wipe out the Taliban.  Well, for a while.  We weakened them.  They did stage a good comeback.  Yeah.  We weakened them for a while.  We did nothing to the Taliban.  Yeah.  Well, let me ask you something.  Again, you've got to go back to a 9-11 mindset.  The whole fucking nation wanted blood.  Yes.  We wanted somebody to get their ass fucking kicked.  Yes.  And in hindsight, we can all look back and say,  Oh, boy, what expensive...  But everyone wanted blood. 
[01:13:30]  Everyone had American flags on their cars  and wanted someone to get a bloody fucking nose  for what we saw on 9-11.  And now, in hindsight, people are going,  Duh!  Blood for George Bush and his wars!  Fuck you!  You all wanted it!  You all wanted blood!  A lot of people...  I'll say this.  I was for it and I shouldn't have been.  Of course you were.  A lot of people weren't.  Not a lot of people.  No, no, no.  A few people weren't.  I think the majority of America wanted the war.  Not the Iraq War.  They didn't.  No, no.  No, you're right.  They wanted blood like insane.  Afghanistan is what we should have gone after.  You're right. 
[01:14:00]  And you know what we should have done?  We should have handled Saudi Arabia.  We should have fucking handled...  That's crazy.  ...Saudi Arabia.  ...for the country.  We can't do that ever.  That's a big piece of the problem right there is Saudi Arabia.  But we make believe that isn't part of the problem.  That's exactly what we always have.  I just can't stand when people don't...  They look back...  Or they think about this with only hindsight.  They don't think about the way we thought after 9-11. 
[01:14:30]  We wanted blood.  And that's the only reason that whole Iraq thing was able to even happen.  I agree with you.  And that was a debacle.  We shouldn't have gone into Iraq.  I'd rather Saddam still be there fucking his people over, to tell you the truth.  But the Afghanistan thing, we definitely wanted it.  It shouldn't have lasted 10 years, though.  You know what?  It's not an easy fucking thing.  I'm just asking a question.  The Soviets proved that in Afghanistan.  Well, can you imagine if we had focused all of our resources on Afghanistan and doing that?  Exactly.  Instead of wasting it in both countries.  I agree with you. 
[01:15:00]  We might have done a better job of rooting out the Taliban.  But the Taliban is never going anywhere.  Hey, you wanted it more than I did.  Yeah, you're right.  I agree with you.  But I also think a lot of people forget, a lot of people don't admit that they were even behind going into Iraq.  I admit I was.  At the time.  At the time I was.  That false intelligence, the weapons of mass destruction, bullshit.  Everybody was set up. 
[01:15:30]  And we were grinding our teeth to punch someone in the face.  After watching the towers come down, the Pentagon get hit, a plane crash in fucking Pennsylvania.  We all wanted blood.  And it took a while to get that going, right?  And now no one.  Ask anybody and they're all, bleh, bleh.  We all did shut up.  How long did it take for us to get going on that whole thing?  A year?  Yeah, it was about.  Not even.  No, it was a few months before.  Was it a few months?  I'm trying to remember.  I don't even think it was that long.  It was one month.  One month that we were already doing shit. 
[01:16:00]  We were already doing some fucking retribution.  Why do I feel like it was longer?  Like we were all.  No.  Because we were all on the edges of our seats going, come on, let's get this going.  He signed something.  And back then a month was a long time, I guess.  No, he signed something.  Remember his press conference?  I started today with the stroke of a pen.  Yes, yes.  And we were like, what the fuck are you doing?  Kicking some ass.  Taking some names.  That's right.  More Obama from last night.  But when Governor Romney and his friends in Congress tell us,  we can somehow lower our deficits by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy? 
[01:16:30]  Well, what did Bill Clinton call it?  You do the arithmetic.  You do the math.  Right before he shoved a saglar in that girl's pussy.  I refuse to go along with that.  And as long as I'm president, I never will.  I refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home  or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut. 
[01:17:00]  Is that not a tax cut for the fucker's sake?  Does Romney want to do that?  No.  Does he want to eliminate the homeowner's tax write-off?  No.  Okay.  And it's got nothing to do with raising taxes.  We're talking about the Bush-era tax cuts that are still in place.  Obama has wanted those things gone for a while now.  But Congress wouldn't allow that.  He's wanted them gone, though. 
[01:17:30]  Now, what the hell is to say that if you just leave them there, that is lowering taxes?  What it is is the new tax rate.  That's the tax rate, what it is right now.  So instead of saying that Romney wants to lower taxes for the wealthy, how about you  be honest and say what, in essence, it really is, is Obama wants to raise taxes.  But would Romney, any of his policies, take any percentage of those write-offs away from 
[01:18:00]  middle class families?  I heard Obama's plan has taking benefits, your tax benefits, deductions away from homeowners.  That's what I've heard.  That's the one I've heard.  It's exactly the opposite.  I don't know.  I would find that hard to buy.  Sean Hannity?  No.  Yeah.  Was it Sean?  No.  Probably whispered it to you.  No.  Oh, I forgot the guy's name.  Someone from Fox.  Yeah.  I'm sure it was Fox. 
[01:18:30]  Was it a guy named Disinformation?  I love people that say, because you watch Fox, what do you watch?  MSNBC.  Commie!  I hate MSNBC.  Do you watch them all?  Yeah, I do.  CNN isn't as bad as MSNBC.  No, no.  MSNBC could be the worst thing that isn't just some fucking radical that's broadcasting  from a ship offshore.  What's that?  What's that?  Oh, Chip.  Who do you hate the most on that channel? 
[01:19:00]  Everyone.  Who?  I hate everybody on that.  Reverend Al.  Harry Potter.  The Harry Potter kid?  Yeah.  That fucking idiot.  That's Chris Hayes, I think.  The lesbian looking one?  Justin Bieber.  Yeah.  That would be...  Reverend Al.  Matt Al.  Reverend Al.  Yeah.  What about Ed Schultz?  I hate him.  He's just trying to be Rush Limbaugh for the left.  I hate him.  What a blowhard.  I hate the other guy, too.  Hey, this is...  That's Chris Matthews.  Chris Matthews. 
[01:19:30]  You know, it's like our soldiers on post.  So, you got Harry Potter.  You got Justin Bieber.  Yeah.  You got Rush Limbaugh.  The California Raisin.  Evil Rush Limbaugh.  No, how would you say...  Whatever.  But he's a Rush Limbaugh type.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you got Brian Regan.  Hey!  And then Reverend Al, who's just melting away, looking creepier and creepier by the day.  You know, this is Mount Rushmore.  What happened to Reverend Al, you think? 
[01:20:00]  He got the stomach tied up?  He must have.  He's as thin as a pin.  Someone's got to tell him, if you're on TV every night, you can't scowl at the people.  But that's just his face.  I don't even think it's...  He doesn't know how to smile?  Yeah.  I think it's just the old fat from his face drooping down like a Sharpay.  Oh, so it's tough to push all that up into a smile?  So it looks like a scowl.  He's a Sharpay.  That's great.  He might be right on that.  Too much to lift up into a smile.  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, I hate him.  Oh, I just despise that guy.  I refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children out of Head Start programs  to eliminate health insurance for millions of Americans who are poor and elderly or disabled.  Also, those with the most can pay less.  I'm not going along with that.  All right.  Yeah, I'm for Obama now. 
[01:21:00]  Fuck it.  Good.  Fuck it.  You know, and I got a challenge on that whole starting the war thing.  This guy says it was March.  I think it was.  I think it was about six months after 9-11.  I think you're right.  I don't think it was a month.  No.  And when you said that, I'm like, I just don't feel like it was only a month.  Cruise missiles were sent in.  A month in?  He lobbed some cruise missiles into Afghanistan.  Right away?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.  Dude, I remember sitting there going, when are we going to do something?  A month or six weeks in, he said something in a press conference. 
[01:21:30]  He said, I started with the stroke of a pen.  But then I think.  I remember that because we were like, what the fuck are you doing?  And I think it took even more time before something significant happened.  I just have that feeling that it was a long time.  Because we're all sitting here in New York going, what the fuck?  Let's go.  Do something.  Yeah.  I think he's right.  But then you remember that we just didn't know what to do.  We're like, well, how do you fucking fight this terrorism thing?  I don't know.  Can we look that up?  I believe it was.  I don't think we did anything a month in. 
[01:22:00]  We might have talked a good deal.  I know we didn't.  Because I remember when I was in Iraq in 2003 and 2004, I was talking to Special Forces guys, Green Berets,  who said they were, as they say, boots on the ground, like early October of 2011.  We're like, really?  You guys were here that early?  What?  It was in Iraq.  Well, they touched down in Afghanistan.  So I remember-  You said October 2011.  No, I meant 2001.  Okay.  They were there a month after 9-11.  And I remember, we didn't know people were on the ground that soon. 
[01:22:30]  They go, yeah, we were Dutch down.  Because one of them spoke Farsi.  Right.  Another one, they had these really weird, but they were legit Green Berets.  So we were there right away, but then we had to figure out what the fuck we were going  to do.  Yeah, but nobody knew they were there.  So the war definitely didn't start a month in.  Sam?  I don't think it did, Am.  Do you have information finally?  I've had it.  Military operations started in October.  The war wasn't declared.  Right.  Right.  But military operations started October 7th-ish.  Which is those guys on the ground, yeah.  And airstrikes started.  Airstrikes.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember, like, cruise missiles going off.  Then you're right, man. 
[01:23:00]  I just felt like we were just waiting and waiting and waiting.  I thought we were too, bro.  Yeah.  Maybe that's almost a month, so maybe that was it.  Yeah.  But a month, like, was a long time back then.  We wanted something to happen, like, the next day.  Yeah.  Yup.  And Mohammed Atef was killed in November.  Of 2001.  Who's Mohammed Atef?  Number three in Al-Qaeda.  Wow.  Number three.  Coming in at number three.  Was he number three? 
[01:23:30]  I thought it was fucking Bin Laden, Al-Zawahari, and then Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.  Stop making shit up.  We have a brand new number one.  Why don't we continue with Obama from last night?  All right.  I kind of like this part of the speech.  Oh.  Thank you.  God bless.  People's voices need to be heard.  Oh, okay.  It was clever.  Yeah.  Some say it was a page out of Reagan's book.  Yes.  Reagan liked to really personalize in his speeches.  Yeah, he did.  If you turn away now, if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for is impossible, 
[01:24:00]  well, change will not happen.  Will.  If you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference, then other voices will  fill the void, the lobbyists fill the void, the lobbyists and special interests, the people  with the $10 million checks who are trying to buy this election, and those who are trying  to make it harder for you to vote, Washington politicians who want to decide who you can marry  or control health care choices that women should be making for themselves. 
[01:24:30]  Woo!  Woo!  Only you can make sure that doesn't happen.  Only you have the power to move us forward.  Yeah, this was the end of that segment of the speech where he brought up, you know, specific  people and what they have done.  Eek-ski.  Socially, though, and this Ryan's a conservative, isn't he? 
[01:25:00]  Like a real religious conservative?  I mean, I just, I hate the Republicans' social fucking meddling.  Hate them for it.  And I agree with them financially.  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of that whole fucking getting everybody's business.  To me, that's a greater problem.  It's almost like they force us to choose between what we, like, you can't be socially  fairly liberal and fiscally conservative.  You can't be.  You have to make a decision.  They should tell the Republicans, keep your nose out of my ass so a big fat cock can get 
[01:25:30]  in there.  Or at least a finger that goes hee-dee-hooded, hee-dee-hooded, hee-dee-hooded.  That's not going to fit on a button.  No?  No.  Well, once you vote black, you never go back fits on a button.  I saw quite a few of those.  You saw that, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's fine, though.  Um, how about, uh, once you vote right, you know you vote right.  White.  White, right.  Right.  White.  What?  Once you vote white, you know you vote right.  I want one of those buttons. 
[01:26:00]  Can I wear one of those out and not be beaten to a pulp or, uh, uh, uh, told to take it off  because I'm creating a ruckus?  Or, uh, uh, why, why, why is once you vote black, you never go back, um, acceptable?  Well, it kind of rhymes, though.  Acceptable.  It's kind of nice.  Why is that acceptable?  Because it rhymes.  Isn't that a complete racially based vote?  You're voting for black?  I hate the fact, I fucking hate the fact that blacks are completely getting away with being 
[01:26:30]  absolutely racist and, um, uh, just doing things based on the color of someone's skin  with the, the least fucking thought of content of character.  Well, what, what, what, I don't know.  I hate it because I, I'm fucking, I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  What?  I, my fucking freedom of speech is in chains because I can't say what I want to say without  being persecuted and labeled and the scarlet letter of racism. 
[01:27:00]  We're just paying the price for other people.  It stinks.  And this, this, so this time is very, paying the price of what people, what people, people  in ancient fucking history, no, no, no, people who, people who are still, in some cases  still living, we're just too close to it.  It's, believe me, it drives me crazy.  It affects me.  I hate it.  You think it gets a lot better a couple more generations down the line?  Eventually it just balances out a little bit because we are now paying the fucking  price.  Oh, please.  But that's what it is.  Please.  It's, we have to look at it.  How long do we pay? 
[01:27:30]  How long do we pay?  How long does, do these crime stats that were in the paper yesterday have to continually pile  up before people fucking act like human fucking beings?  No, I don't mean that.  I'm talking about with language.  I'm talking the whole thing because that's all part of it.  It's this, this entitlement, this, this untouchability that, that, that, oh, you, I could do whatever  the fuck I want, but you're restricted to my fucking will and whim.  But that's, that's kind of how it was here for such a long time.  No, no, but I mean.  So, so then it's got to be opposite for a while to make up for lost time instead of just realizing 
[01:28:00]  something was wrong, the, the, the, the, the latitude that has been given blacks in  this country over the past few years to make up for all that history.  And I'm not just talking slavery.  I'm talking about all this anti fucking the Jim Crow, the, the, uh, need for civil rights  in, in the first place, all that shit.  It shouldn't be like it is now.  Still, it shouldn't be like it is now.  There's this underlying fucking bullshit that's going on where there's a great excuse. 
[01:28:30]  And they're never afraid to use it.  I'm yeah.  But again, I, I, I don't disagree.  Let's say, I'm not talking about that.  I'm saying like, if we look at it, like, Oh, my mistake.  No, no, but I mean, if we, if we, of course I, I agree.  But if we, if we step back and go, why is this happening?  Why is it?  I mean, there's a lot of sickening white guilt.  I hate it.  But the reality is I wish, and people get people like you're a liberal.  I'm really not.  But I'm realistic about how absolutely fraudulently the country talked about freedoms and blah, 
[01:29:00]  blah, blah.  And all, every single fucking person that has something that, that, that they wanted here  had to fight for it.  Like very rarely have, have rights just been given to different groups without them fighting  and kicking and screaming.  Meanwhile, the country goes, Oh, no, no, no.  We're freedom.  This is the place to come for, from a free from oppression, blah, blah, blah.  Unless, of course, you're, you're a fucking spook or if you're a woman or if you're a 
[01:29:30]  fucking, uh, it's like, and I'm not saying America's bad, but this full of shitness that  has been here for so long, we, we can't get angry now because we're involved with some  full of shitness.  It's like, this is just another fucking way that the country dishonestly handles everybody  being treated the same.  I don't know.  I, I've spoken to people and heard people speak that have no fucking clue what happened 
[01:30:00]  a couple of years ago in, as far as history and things that should affect them in this  country.  Yet they remember slavery.  They remember Jim Crow.  They remember the fucking riots in Watts.  Oh, you remember all that, or at least you know about the history of it.  If you're not even old enough to remember it actually happening yet, you don't remember  important political things or, uh, or even things in the news that happened a few years  ago.  It's convenient.  It's the most convenient excuse a race has had, uh, ever, ever in this country. 
[01:30:30]  And I think things are so much better now that it's got to start turning back the other  way.  We can't make excuses as to why 90 fucking 4% of all shootings in New York city are done  by black and Hispanic people.  Stop it already.  I'm not saying that that's, I'm not saying that people should be able to behave the way  they want.  I'm only saying that when you look at the country, we have to look at it realistically  and America, especially when it comes to race has done nothing, but be full of shit. 
[01:31:00]  And then that's the truth.  How is this, how is this guy in office then?  If we're so full of shit, even today, how did so many white people, by the way, every  black person in the country could have voted for Obama.  Uh, and it still, if no white people voted for him, it would have been a landslide.  One of the biggest in presidential history.  Because things change.  For the other way.  Things do change.  But there's so many white people voting for him.  So yeah, things do change.  So how about fucking, uh, the, the response to all the oppression starts fucking changing. 
[01:31:30]  But do you see how frustrating it is the way the media handles things?  Like we're looking at it like that and it's frustrating and it's phony and it's fucking  pandering.  It's so easy to see where the country is full of shit there.  Like the mentality is full of shit there.  Why is it so hard to see overall?  It's, it's just one more step in, in us as a country, not handling this stuff.  When you say, honestly, and when you say the country, who, who do you mean?  That's a very vague term.  Us as a collective.  Us as a collective.  You can't pin it on one guy. 
[01:32:00]  It's us as a collective.  It's like, uh, you know, we, we are all kind of a part of it.  And the people that yell, yell about it at one point are called this.  So you're called a liberal or you're called, uh, an abolitionist at one point, but you  don't say it or whatever it is you're called, but never have people just been given, uh,  the right.  That's what drives me crazy here is like, you've never heard anybody in this country lobby for  the rights of other people, but not their own.  Like no one has ever said you guys should be able to do this, but I shouldn't never. 
[01:32:30]  Every fucking group in the country is like, here's why I or we should be able to do this  or say this.  And here's the justifiable reason you shouldn't.  So it's like we've proven, that's why I say we, because as a collective, we've just proven  that we're fucking full of shit when it comes to this stuff.  We're comfortable telling everybody else how to fucking handle their business.  But when it comes here, uh, you know, literally 40 fucking years ago or 50 years ago, we were  telling a good piece of the population, go fight a war and then you can't vote. 
[01:33:00]  And it's really hard for that just to get washed away immediately.  I'm not saying it won't go away, but realistically, that's why it's here.  Uh, yeah, I understand why it's here.  I just think it's a, I think it's a very long running excuse at this point.  In some cases, you're right.  I think a lot of people are using it.  Yeah.  Um, I don't see, I don't see a real, um, assimilation into society here.  I'm seeing a lot of separatism that's coming from people that are against separatism. 
[01:33:30]  I'm seeing a lot of, uh, racially based decisions instead of, like I said, judging someone on the  content of their character.  Uh, a lot of people are making judgments based on nothing but the color of someone's skin.  Part for the course here.  That's, that's what we do.  It's like, that's exactly, you just made my point.  You're right.  That's exactly what has been happening since day one here.  It's never changed.  So the, this has shifted, that has shifted, but we have always based things on one group 
[01:34:00]  doing something that the other group can't.  Whatever, whatever each group is.  And now it's just this way.  So you and I are being fucking frustrated with it.  I mean, I talk for a living too, and I despise the stats and the fucking white guilt, but  I know what it is.  Let's, uh, there's two really good phone calls right now.  Jason in Cleveland wants to talk.  I can't believe that.  Well, he wants to talk to you, Anthony.  All righty.  Go ahead, Jason.  Hey, uh, what's up, man?  I'm a black guy.  I've been listening to the show for a year.  I love it.  Thank you.  But some of your views on black people are skewed. 
[01:34:30]  You act like that we sit here and vote is selective and move as a school of fish.  And there's a big, there's a big dynamic between black people.  And I look at some of these stats, I look at some of these niggas down in the woods, like  I'm going through East St. Louis right now, and I just go, what the fuck is wrong with  y'all?  But I get up, I work hard in the morning, and I do what I have to do to make sure my  family's taken care of.  I am not accusing or putting the label on every black person. 
[01:35:00]  I try to stress that at every turn, but at that point, that part doesn't get through.  Yeah, but the way you voice your opinions, you voice it as we're all one.  Well, you do, but you want to be all one when it's convenient, and when it's a good thing,  and when it's looked at, what?  Once again, you're putting, once again, you're putting, you're putting all of us into something.  I don't want to be all one. 
[01:35:30]  Good.  I don't want to be all one.  Well, you're an anomaly.  I'm not an anomaly.  Yeah, I think you are.  No, I'm not.  That's not a derogatory term for a black person.  Fucking anomalies.  They're all over the fucking place.  Hey, class.  And do you generalize, you think?  I might.  Because I think that's this guy's point.  I think he feels like you generalize, and not every black person is of one. 
[01:36:00]  I understand that, but it's based on what I see, and a lot of what I see is a collective,  a black collective, a black pride, a black we must as black people move forward, and I  see that, but the second I bring it up, I'm being racist and generalizing, but then black  people that want to be included in this group, it's fine with them.  Yeah, I talked to you before about this.  How many black people do you actually hang out with, or do you actually talk to on a personal 
[01:36:30]  one-on-one level?  Two.  Two.  Two.  Yeah, Logan and Drew Boogie.  That's it.  Do you hang out with them after work?  Do you go and talk to them, or do you talk to them?  No, but let me tell you something.  The only time you really see that happening is in commercials, because a lot of the time,  white people hang out.  The majority of white people hang out a majority of the time with other white people, and vice  versa.  Black people, normally in groups, will hang out with black people. 
[01:37:00]  It's just the way it is.  It depends on what you do for a living, too.  What kind of young people you're forcing to act with.  Slave owner.  But I mean, if you work at the post office or whatever, even though you might hang out  with your group, some jobs have you mixed in just construction.  Well, work, I'm not talking about working.  I'm talking about your leisure time hanging out.  When you're socializing.  When you're socializing.  I think Anthony is correct for that.  If it's a Doritos commercial, you'd think of fucking blacks and Asians and everyone having a great  party together.  It just gets along, right?  Right, right, right.  All right, Jason, I've got to move on, too.  Thank you.  Thanks, Jason.  I know Jason gets a little warm-winded.  We've had him on the show before. 
[01:37:30]  Is it Sean in Georgia?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  This goes to Jimmy's point, by the way.  That's why I wanted to take this call.  Uh-huh.  Jimmy was absolutely right.  My mother and my grandmother, I stay in Georgia, born and raised here, and they lived  through the civil rights and all the violence that was going on in Georgia, and my mother  was telling me how bad it was here.  In fact, let me tell you this.  Where I work at now, it was a guy that was sneaking around and talking to this white girl. 
[01:38:00]  It was a black guy, and he was only like 18 years old, and a white girl was only, she  was like 18, too.  They were just getting out of high school.  So, they found that guy swinging in a tree about two weeks after her daddy told him  not to talk to him.  Now, I mean...  Well, how long ago was that?  This was in the 50s.  Yeah, of course.  I mean, but I'm saying, though, if you're 18 in the 50s, I mean, you're only like, what,  50?  I mean, you're only... 
[01:38:30]  There's still a lot of...  Let me tell you something.  It's not...  All right, let me allow me to retort.  But this isn't...  I'm not talking about old mammies and pappies walking around the city getting a bug up  their ass about Whitey.  I'm talking about a complete younger generation that has been completely removed from this.  Not the stories.  Hold on, hold on.  I got it.  Because I do have a point.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  You say completely removed.  Let's say, in your own family, they have stories of... 
[01:39:00]  They do.  Okay, so what do you do?  Doesn't that affect you?  Not at fucking all.  If anything, sir, I think the contrast of listening to your grandparents to what the fuck is happening  today should make you go, wow, things have really changed for the better.  But if you knew a group affected your parents or your aunts or uncles, that wouldn't bother you?  Of course it would.  Of course it would.  You picked up your parents, Rachel.  Don't I hear you?  If I knew my mother was...  I have to say this.  If I knew my mother and dad were being hosed, I'd be fucking pretty pissed off at that group 
[01:39:30]  of people still.  And we pick...  I absolutely would be.  It has to be said.  Hold on, sir.  We're not removed from it yet.  And don't forget, aunt, you pick up your parents.  I mean, we all kind of do.  We pick up our parents' attitudes about things.  It's normal.  Why wouldn't that bother you, aunt?  Seriously.  Let's say someone in your family...  Hold on!  Hold on, sir.  We'll get to you.  We're not going to hang up on you.  If, like, let's just say your mom was hosed when she was growing up because of the color  of her skin, wouldn't that bother you?  Wouldn't you be...  Wouldn't you be... 
[01:40:00]  I cannot answer that question.  I'd be silly if I tried to answer how I would feel, not knowing what that's like.  But wouldn't you hate that group for doing that to your mom?  Okay.  That group.  Who's that group?  Well...  Who's that group?  It was a society that was, at the time, happening.  Nobody that was doing that is around to do that right now.  They're around some of them.  Oh, well, they're around.  But what I'm saying is it's not happening anymore.  But you wouldn't be affected by that?  I don't know how I'd be affected by that.  But not through unbelievable violence and not through fucking this separatist attitude 
[01:40:30]  that's going on.  Let's say Muslims.  Let's say Muslims did something horrific to, you know, the elders in...  Shut the fuck up.  And we're making it...  He's just trying to get his point in.  Yeah, he's just trying to get his point in.  We will go back to you.  He's just trying to get his point in.  But let's say it's Muslims or something.  Did something horrific to your, you know, your elders.  Well...  You'd be all right with Muslims?  They did, if you look at 9-11.  Yeah, but there's a lot of hatred toward Muslims. 
[01:41:00]  That's not going to go away anytime soon.  And I'm sure in 1960, it was very bad.  But it goes back to Jimmy's point.  There's still too many people that have very vivid stories of what happened to them.  And that plays into this whole thing.  It's too close, dude.  We're living...  It's just too close.  It isn't too close.  How about what the fuck the Japanese did to Pearl Harbor?  And they've been a close ally for fucking years now.  Yeah.  I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I'll tell you why.  Because the people, there was, again, Patrice, this is Patrice's genius point, was about the Jews and Hitler. 
[01:41:30]  They had a face.  They had a Hitler...  They didn't like each other.  They really had a weird relationship.  Yeah.  But at the end of World War II, there was a beginning, middle, and end of that.  They attacked.  Fucking war.  Bomb.  Surrender.  Done.  There was a beginning, middle, and end of it.  There was a solution.  It wasn't this fucking long, long centuries thing that kind of was supposed to take care  of itself and then didn't and then kind of...  It's a totally different thing, man.  Okay.  It's totally different. 
[01:42:00]  But there's got to be a solution to it.  And I think the way this country has been lately, the past couple of decades, has really  shown that this country has changed a lot.  I agree.  But what I don't see changing is this mindset.  I see it getting worse.  I see more of this entitlement.  It's worse, you think?  Yes.  Absolutely.  Because I think...  We are at one of the most divided points in our nation's history since Jim Crow.  And fuck it.  The racial divide in this country is astounding. 
[01:42:30]  It's not getting better, you don't think?  I don't think it is.  I think there's a lot of resentment on the part of white America.  And I don't think they speak up.  I think people are...  It caves in fear.  White people.  Let's go to Rick in Ohio.  Rick.  What happened to Sean?  Is he gone?  He's there.  Okay.  Hey, I just want to know.  I want to ask you if it's okay that I resent black people for fucking with me when I was  younger.  I mean, should I carry that on with my kids and say, hey, black people are assholes because  they...  Makes a point.  Yeah.  Dude, absolutely. 
[01:43:00]  I think it is okay.  Yeah.  I mean, I would too.  Sure.  It all depends what your experiences are.  I remember the Gimme 50 Cent guy.  Right.  Very angry with him.  Dude, it's hard not to resent people who treated you poorly.  Yeah, of course.  That's human nature.  Treated you poorly.  Not your grandparents.  And like I said, the contrast between them and now should be almost something to make  you say, wow, things are changed.  Maybe I should fucking change and get with the program.  See, we want it to happen.  I said, get with the program.  We want it to happen now. 
[01:43:30]  That's the frustrating part.  We want it to happen in our lifetimes.  It's not going to happen in our lifetime.  It's not going to happen.  No.  But it is happening slowly.  It's a major shift.  And it's slow.  Again, in human lifetime, it's forever.  But look back to Alexander the Great.  That's 2,000 years ago.  But the people...  I hear he was just pretty good.  It was Alexander the Average.  He was packing six.  Yeah.  But by the way, to the scumbag on Twitter, I'm so happy I blocked you.  The liberal media has programmed you well, Jim. 
[01:44:00]  Like, you...  I hate the liberal media more than...  I have to make a new account, by the way, so I can follow you again.  I literally...  There's very few people that detest the media or call the media out as much as I do, you  dumb motherfucker.  Yeah.  Yeah, you are all over the...  I hate them!  ...fucking phonies.  I hate them!  Well, let me just let Sean say something.  He was just trying to get in there.  He was trying to get in there.  He's done.  Oh.  Oh, is he gone?  Oh, the poor guy.  I didn't hang up on him.  I said we would get back to him.  You oppressed him. 
[01:44:30]  I just...  It's hard when you're on hold.  Yeah.  I think it's a very complicated issue, obviously.  It really is.  But I just know my own family, man.  You know, if some group did something horrible to any member of my family, yeah, I think we're  going to hold a grudge for a while.  Dude, you still hate Jane Seymour.  Yeah, of course.  It's the different thing, though, hating...  You're mixing things up.  That's why I say it's complicated.  Hating individuals is different than hating a society and rules that are in place for 
[01:45:00]  a society.  But you can't keep blaming individuals for what the collective did years ago, especially  when it's been solved.  And there are going to always be individuals that are still a little off.  Sure.  And others, but looking at the society as a whole, you being part of the society as a  whole should realize things are better and not fuck things up.  But a lot of people, the argument on the other side would be, you're right.  Yeah.  But the collective, we look now where we are right now, and there are groups of people 
[01:45:30]  who benefited tremendously, generationally, by the way things always were.  And there are people in the last X amount of years who are just kind of left to put things  together and pick up the pieces and fucking move on.  And then the people who have benefited from the way things were for all this time are going,  what the fuck's wrong with you?  And the people who are picking things up are going, uh, we're just kind of getting  things together here.  Yeah.  I'm not saying that justifies crime or anything, but I mean, there is a realistic way to look 
[01:46:00]  at it.  If we were looking back at history, at the amount of changes this country has gone through,  and we were looking, say, back a thousand years, and it was a 50-year period, we wouldn't  take some, well, from 1950 to 1975, look at, you'd look at it like, well, look at all the  changes in the 19th century.  Right.  But then the 21st century was a lot better.  Like, that's how we, history judges things.  It doesn't judge them in 20-year blocks.  You're right.  We're 40-year blocks.  By the way, I don't think it makes it okay to do, you know, do...  Dude, I think people in the media should be killed. 
[01:46:30]  Right, right.  They're terrible.  I see how you would be...  Well, you don't like them.  No, they're terrible.  Yeah.  I see how you would be influenced, but I don't think it's okay then you'd turn around and  do horrific things.  Yeah.  I don't either.  I...  You know, but I think it's, you know, it's a complicated issue.  It is complicated.  It is very complicated, and I think, I think when it's convenient, you'll get groups that  will condemn something, and then they'll embrace the same fucking thing when it's to 
[01:47:00]  their advantage and benefit.  Yeah, that's true.  And, all right, I understand that's just basic human nature also, but there seems to be a  real divide with certain groups, more so than other groups.  Absolutely.  And I think black people are notorious for chastising people for saying and doing one  thing, but then embracing people for almost doing the same exact things if it benefits.  They're great Americans then.  What?  That's exactly what we've always done.  We talk out of both sides of our mouth, and I'm not...  Arr-gar-gar-gar-gar-gar.  I love the country, I really do, but it's like when you say that, people are like, love 
[01:47:30]  it or leave it, but you can't not acknowledge the fucking completely full of shit way we  have handled ourselves in many ways.  Yeah.  And, you know...  Hey, by the way, I mean, just so you know, Ant, and the show knows, because we try to  get all the voices out there.  People are agreeing with you.  Oh, yeah, that's fine.  I'm sure plenty of people...  No, no, believe me.  You can put some of them on.  The people that are bashing me, I'm fine with hearing from them.  I don't care.  Let's go to Reggie.  Reggie.  Take us out, you hooves animal. 
[01:48:00]  Hi, Reggie.  Best line ever.  Thank you.  Anthony, I just want to let you know that this shit still goes on.  I'm not going to disagree with you that things have changed tremendously.  Yeah.  You know, even in my life, I can see it.  Uh-huh.  But also in my life, there's been...  I was beat up by the cops in 1991.  All right.  Five white cops, personally, myself, right after the Rodney King...  What were you doing?  Go ahead.  What were you doing?  What were the details?  Oh, we don't need to get into all the details. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, okay.  Well, it might have been something.  Wait, were you doing something wrong?  I was with a white woman.  But what were you doing wrong, Reggie?  Yeah, what happened?  You're not telling the whole story.  You already said...  I'll tell you the whole story.  Yeah.  The whole story is this.  I was in a disagreement with my white girlfriend.  Uh-huh.  Might have slapped her a couple times.  Sometimes you've got to smack a bitch.  No, no, I never put my hands on a woman.  All right.  I'll shake the shit out of a bitch, but, you know. 
[01:49:00]  Anyway, what happened was I had a...  You can only imagine.  I had a problem with this particular officer,  and he saw that we were in an argument,  and, you know, he went a little bit overboard,  called me back up,  and, you know, I got...  All right.  ...strapped around the asphalt a little bit.  All right.  My point is, Anthony, that, you know,  those types of things, the discrimination,  I deal with institutional racism right now, right? 
[01:49:30]  These things still go on,  and they happen within my generation  to people that I know and myself.  All right, can I tell you what happens?  It hasn't changed tremendously.  Right. I understand your point.  But can you understand this?  How about what I looked at yesterday  as far as New York City crime stats?  I was even astounded.  I was even astounded.  And you say you have to deal with this institutional racism  where an occasional cop works somebody over.  I understand.  It shouldn't be accepted.  But the crime that blacks and Hispanics, 
[01:50:00]  I'm not going to just say blacks,  but non-whites are committing in inner cities,  and especially the stats that came in for New York yesterday,  it's in the 90% range.  90% range of these violent crimes and murders  are being committed and committed upon  blacks and Hispanics in our city.  That's their shit.  You're right.  That's exactly what black people contribute.  It's our shit, too.  In a meeting, that's what black people,  that's the crimes black people commit. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  But what percentage of blacks  have fucked families out of their homes  by embezzling $50 million?  Do you think that goes on  as widespread as common crime  in our inner cities  that are being committed by minorities?  Not on an individual level,  but financially,  it affects a tremendous amount of people.  Holy shit.  Right.  The fact, and also the other one,  70%,  over 70% of robberies  are committed  by blacks and Hispanics  in New York City, 
[01:51:00]  while 30% of the victims  are black or Hispanic.  Where do you think  that fucking number comes in?  That extra 40%  white people  being ravaged  by minorities  in the streets.  Chickens coming home to roost.  Motherfucker, blow me.  I ain't fucking taking that shit.  It's time for fucking whitey  to realize  we don't have to be victims anymore.  Fucking victims.  No, but you said 40%.  There's 70%.  Because 30% of the victims are black. 
[01:51:30]  The other 70% are probably white.  One more point  before you hang up on me, O.  Yeah, go ahead, Reggie.  Listen, Anthony,  the thing you miss all the time  is you quote these stats,  but you forget about the fact  that this stuff  started all the way back  into slavery, right?  The dismantling of the black.  All these things  have carried over  into the socioeconomic conditions  that we deal with today, right?  Don't get me wrong, Anthony.  You have to understand  that I'm a different  kind of black dude. 
[01:52:00]  I read the same websites  that you read.  I look at these.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Yes.  You're also a pederast?  Chickenhawk.com.  Chickenhawk.com.  I'll fucking joke.  All right.  Thank you, Reggie.  I hear you.  I know.  Look, again, again,  when an educated black man  calls up,  I'm not lumping everybody  into one category,  but I am saying  there's a disproportionate problem  in the black community. 
[01:52:30]  I've heard all these reasons  why it's happening,  but I don't believe them all.  I think a lot of it  is an excuse.  I don't think these people,  or they better not at least  be running around  with no concept  of crime consequence,  no concept of guilt,  no concept of how to work  in a society.  Are you telling me  when these people  commit these crimes  that they don't know  what they're doing?  That's fucking frightening.  Well, if black society  in general cares about  this issue, 
[01:53:00]  then they should call out  their black leaders.  Obviously, the black leaders  aren't doing their job.  You can't because the second one  steps up to say something,  they're an Uncle Tom,  a piece of shit.  There's a problem  in the black community  being able to embrace  the fact that  if you're a well-educated  black man,  you can go anywhere  in this world  a lot easier  than a well-educated  white man at this point.  They're looking to fill jobs  with educated black people.  Isn't it the responsibility  of the black leaders, though?  I think it's one,  but I think it's everybody else's  separate individual responsibility  to know right from fucking wrong. 
[01:53:30]  Well, good point,  but how do you change that?  By smacking some fucking heads!  I'm just asking!  Should it change with leadership?  I don't know.  I just know there's an inherent problem.  The black leaders we see  that pop up on TV,  most of these guys  look like a complete joke.  What, another silence  the violence rally?  That's what I'm talking about.  They look like complete jokes,  and if the black people  have had it with this shit,  then they gotta like...  They haven't!  That's just it!  That's what I'm saying!  Thank you!  Thank you!  I don't know an answer for it. 
[01:54:00]  Because we hear from black people  all the time,  they're sick of this shit  just as much.  Not just as much.  Not just as much.  But they would say that.  I think even more so...  So then they have to look  at their leadership.  They have to.  Yeah.  I agree with that.  People living in that neighborhood  are a lot more sick of it.  I mean,  law-abiding people living  in that neighborhood  are a lot more sick of it  than we are.  They didn't fucking talk  when the cops ask you  a fucking question  about who shot a kid.  They didn't talk  in fucking Gotti's neighborhood  either.  Well, that's different.  Don't you bring  the fucking Italians into this.  But I'm saying,  people know better 
[01:54:30]  than to talk.  I mean,  it's like...  I wouldn't.  But you know what else?  The fucking people  in Gotti's neighborhood  weren't calling the cops  on the fucking  organized crime guys.  No, it's a big difference  because they're calling cops  going,  why ain't the police  doing nothing  in our neighborhoods?  The children are dying  and shit.  And then the cops  go to talk to them.  Everyone clams up.  Fucking start being proactive  and talk against  these motherfuckers.  That's easy.  That's hard to do, man.  I mean, again,  because there's been histories 
[01:55:00]  of people being killed  for that shit  and the cops  aren't going to move you.  The police want to.  They can move you  out of neighborhood  because they don't do that.  So then don't call the cops.  Then don't even fuck  call the cops then.  Just stay in the fucking area.  We'll wall it off  like escape from New York  and have a field day.  This all started with  once you vote black  you never go back.  Exactly.  Because that shirt  in and of itself  is racist.  The phones are lit, man.  Aren't they?  It's amazing.  People love race.  They really do.  But most people  don't talk about it  or argue it.  This guy, Vinyl Radio, 
[01:55:30]  he goes,  Opie, are you saying  it's okay to pass on  your resentment  of a group  who did you wrong  onto your children?  What about forgiveness?  I don't think it's okay  but I understand  why people do it.  It's natural.  It's a natural human instinct.  I'll also address it.  And that is a problem, obviously.  I don't know how  you get past that.  I'll address it.  When you get parents  that try to put  their morals  or immorality  on you,  I would look for anything  to not agree  with my parents.  I don't want to sound 
[01:56:00]  like the man,  but it's true.  You look for things.  You seek out things  and try not to agree  with your parents  on a lot of things.  But the fact is,  in the end,  you really are influenced  by your parents  a lot more than you probably  realize.  Sometimes in a complete  opposite way.  And Ant just admitted  that he's a college hippie.  Nice.  Nice.  You long hair?  God damn long hair.  I think if your dad  was alive today,  you guys would really  get along.  Son of a bitch. 
[01:56:30]  You really would get along.  Jesus, Ant,  give them a break.  Give them a break.  Actually,  my dad held two black people  at gunpoint  on his property once  because they were robbing  his welding shed.  Did he shoot?  No, he held him  for the cops.  Wow.  With his 357 magnum.  How itchy was his finger?  Pretty itchy.  I would imagine.  It was in the papers.  It was back in the late 80s.  What were they stealing?  They were trying to steal  his welding equipment.  Wow.  And he heard a rat,  a ruckus going on outside.  He came out  and, yeah, 
[01:57:00]  held the two of them  there for the po-po.  Wow.  We got Stunt Brain.  He has landed.  Oh.  Stunt Brain was at the DNC  last night in Charlotte.  Yeah,  and I left Charlotte  this morning  as you guys were just  starting into the speech  and I land to the  snitches get stitches hour.  Yes.  Beautiful.  Did this all happen  because of the,  another speech  by President Obama  bringing us all together?  Well, that,  the once you vote black  you never go back  shirts and pins 
[01:57:30]  that were there.  I think even if you  break that down  you realize people  vote for candidates  for pretty dumb reasons  sometimes.  Well, you know what?  If you're voting  just based on skin color  then don't complain  when people are judged  poorly by skin color too.  But how many,  how many women voted  for President Kennedy  because they thought  they had a shot with him?  More Mimi Binsley.  They didn't even,  they didn't even listen  to his policy.  They're like,  holy fuck,  you know,  maybe,  maybe I have a shot  at this guy.  Yeah.  He's gorgeous.  Go to the moon  and fuck those other broads. 
[01:58:00]  Stunt Brain,  how close were you  to Obama  in that arena last night?  I was close early  and then remember  I told you that I thought  there was going to be  a problem with the crush  of passes  that they distributed?  Yeah.  We had five passes  when the day started  and it got cut back  to three.  Oh.  So I was in the press  filing room  just after Gabby Giffords  started the very emotional  Pledge of Allegiance  that she delivered.  and then I figured  why sit here 
[01:58:30]  and watch it  with a bunch of  unwashed press idiots?  So I rolled out  and got a box of wine  and watched it  in my hotel room.  Box of wine.  You're a box of wine guy?  I'm here at the convention.  Stop bringing it drunk.  It really is.  It's Charlotte.  You can't get a decent  bottle of wine that evening.  That's true.  Charlotte doesn't have  good wine, huh?  Not accessible.  Those bastards.  So, you know,  you gotta shop at Walmart.  But I thought  very interesting night.  I don't know 
[01:59:00]  if you saw my notes on it  but I think Obama  Obama did what  he was supposed to do  but basically asked  for a mulligan.  You know,  if you want to play golf.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think he handled  himself perfectly last night.  There's more work to do.  I think he said  what he had to say.  Mistakes have been made.  Right.  The big news here is  Whether it will work or not  I don't know  but I think, you know,  he did what he had to do  last night.  And there was some weird stuff  because suddenly  they were the party  the Democrats became  the party of personal  responsibility 
[01:59:30]  and you're gonna earn  this on your own  and military.  I mean,  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So P was the  blood lusting  we killed the bad guys party  and we're gonna have  the strongest military  in the world  and suddenly it's  the Democrats.  What happened?  It did come off  as very weird  like I got a weird  vibe when they just  kept saying  and Osama bin Laden  is dead  like it was so  I'll tell you what  action movie-ish.  You know what it is though?  It's like  and we all are guilty of it  we kind of think  we're surprised  when Republicans 
[02:00:00]  do anything  that is pro-black  and we're surprised  when Democrats  show any balls  militarily  and we really shouldn't be  but we are.  Yeah, you're right.  Well, and especially  after Obama said  we're not gonna spike the ball.  Well, Biden spiked the ball.  Oh, everyone was  spiking that ball.  Well, they realized  they need to spike the ball.  Yes.  That's what they realized.  Yeah.  Hey, Stunty,  were you responsible  for that interview  with that woman  that said  that if Romney  gets elected  he should be killed  or something? 
[02:00:30]  No, that's one of our  other intrepid reporters  Tiffany got  a Puerto Rican delegate  and she was talking  to this crazy woman  and she said  if Mr. Romney  gets elected  I want to kill  Mr. Romney.  Wow.  Secret Service  had something to say.  Yeah, the Secret Service  actually tracked  this woman down  and sat down with her  because we were  pointed out  you know, Ted Nugent  makes an offhanded comment  and he gets  Secret Service  basically, you know,  parachuting  into his compound.  This lady says it  and it's on 
[02:01:00]  all over the internet  and nothing.  But yeah, they  Are you sure nothing?  Well, they did contact her.  I don't think  she had her credentials  pulled.  I heard she was  in the hall last night.  Jesus.  I talked to  Jesse Jackson yesterday  and interviewed him  about was he happy  that God was back  in the platform  and he gave me  a nasty look  and just gobbled  out of the platform.  You can't take  God out of anything.  Oh, God.  Jesse.  He's fucking...  Why don't you go  back to Heimatown? 
[02:01:30]  I almost brought  that up  just to ask him.  Oh, boy.  He loves when people  bring that up.  No, he probably  doesn't ask.  Oh, Jimmy.  I wanted to ask him  if his love child  was old enough  to vote this election.  Whoa, that's a good  one, too.  Wow.  Because he walked  off after the God  question.  Do you remember  he had a baby  with a campaign worker  and that kid  disappeared?  Yeah, yeah.  So that child  is probably old  enough to vote now.  Oh, man.  You should have  also asked him  if... 
[02:02:00]  How was it  to actually know  Martha Luther King Jr.?  Were you there  for Menino's speech?  Yeah, I was.  Well, that was  yesterday, the day before.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was yesterday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Menino was mush-mouthed,  but we had a...  There was a Twitter  reaction to Biden,  and every time  he said literally,  Twitter basically  vomited on itself.  It was the drink game  when he said literally.  And I think Ann Coulter  said, you know  when Joe's going  off book  when he says literally. 
[02:02:30]  And he went off script.  And did he look  to you to be  a little intoxicated?  This is where  you play that clip  of him singing  the Villages song.  Where the Villages...  I played him  over-served  singing that song  about that Florida  community.  We assumed earlier  that he's an old-school  politician where  that's acceptable.  It's like,  I'm going out to speak.  Let me have a little whiskey.  Well, you have a couple.  Loosen up.  A couple shooters.  When you have  a couple shooters...  Loosen my throat up a little.  He was good, though. 
[02:03:00]  He connected  with that audience.  I think that the  VP debate is really  going to be huge  with Ryan the technician  and the old-school guy  who's basically  going to go,  whoa, what are you  kidding me?  Yeah, he's going to be  the, listen, son.  Why don't you listen  there, sonny boy?  That's absolutely  a great way to put it.  The old curmudgeon  and the technician.  You think Ryan's  going to be able  to hold his own?  Absolutely.  He held his own  with Obama  a few months ago  during the,  18 months ago  during the healthcare  debate and basically  took Obama 
[02:03:30]  to task on it.  He tasks me.  Hey, let me ask you  a question, Mike.  What's the difference?  Mike!  Mike!  What's the difference  between Obamacare  and Romneycare?  First part of the,  before care.  See, because I've been  spelling them the same way  and people have been  going,  that's not the right  way to spell it, Jim.  You need to take  spelling clits.  That's how I laugh.  You're asking a right winger?  No, but I want,  yeah, exactly.  A right winger?  But he is fairly informed  for an alcoholic.  Let's hear the predictable answer. 
[02:04:00]  No, they're both  takeovers of the healthcare system.  Obamacare will be  a much larger,  huge,  giant monster  that is going to  eat up the whole thing  and put everything  in healthcare.  Ultimately,  it'll be a single-payer system,  which is what,  you know,  England has.  Okay.  And it's going to take  the current healthcare system  and based on CBO projections,  that's the nonpartisan budget office,  it's going to explode the cost. 
[02:04:30]  So it isn't a cost saver  and it will take the system  and make it into  a government-controlled,  government-operated,  and I'm going to get into  the weeds on the math on this.  There's a huge,  equation that shows you  whether or not  you should have a procedure  in Obamacare.  And so they take your age,  what you're intended to do  in the future,  how serious the illness is,  what your current health is,  and if the number  doesn't hit a certain  level at the bottom, 
[02:05:00]  you ain't getting that procedure.  Isn't that kind of how  insurance does it now, though?  Yes and no.  But Obamacare has a,  it is,  I don't want to use  the phrase death panel,  but it does have a metric  in there that you have  to match right now.  You have a little more  leeway currently.  Okay.  If you can go in.  If we could all have  the health care  that Congress has,  I'd say bring it on,  but it's not even close to it.  That's what's enraging.  But what is the difference  between the way Romney did it?  Like, if Romney,  Romney made it work, 
[02:05:30]  I think, didn't he?  I mean, what was the difference  between his,  obviously other than  there's 50 states  instead of one.  Yeah, and you can  control costs better  when you have a smaller pool.  And you can address  problems within it  with a smaller pool.  But were the basic  tenets of it the same?  I believe it's very similar.  But I don't think  you had to give up  your current coverage.  As we were promised,  we wouldn't have to give up  our coverage  if you liked it.  That's not necessarily  going to be true  because companies  are allowed to opt out 
[02:06:00]  on Obamacare.  And they're jumping away  from providing  health care  for their employees  because it's going  to be too expensive.  Do you think that,  like, is this a sticking point  for Romney?  Because if you're saying  there's a couple of differences,  but by and large,  if you look at Romney care,  they can't murder Obama  as hardly as they'd like to  publicly on this  because it's very similar to his?  Well, that is something  he has to address.  And if he's saying  we're going to repeal and replace, 
[02:06:30]  that's the big mantra  that the GOP is saying.  He needs to come out  with specifics now  and say,  here's where the differences are  and here's how  it's going to be better.  Yeah, I mean,  he does like some of the things  and he's agreed with it  by policy alone.  But there are certain things  he doesn't like.  And I think to scrap it  and then come up  with something else  is what he's planning.  Do you think Paul Ryan  was a good choice  or would Rubio have been better?  No, no.  I think Paul Ryan  was a huge choice  because even with Rubio,  you're still not going to get 
[02:07:00]  that Hispanic bloc  that the Democrats  can count on  with the lower income  Hispanic bloc  that they're going to pull.  By getting Paul Ryan,  he pulled the entire  Tea Party  uber financial conservative group  and energized them.  And to your point earlier  about people wanting  to sleep with JFK,  I don't get it.  But a bunch of young  conservative women  think Paul Ryan  and his abs are hot.  And that's the reason  they're going to vote.  That was my point.  That's a good point.  Some people vote  for the dumbest reasons.  But by the way,  him galvanizing 
[02:07:30]  the GOP's conservative money,  that to me  was an unnecessary thing  because Obama  is so liberal.  Literally,  there's nobody  the Republicans  would not have been  galvanized to vote against.  And a lot of people  are saying  that's a mistake  in tactics  to be going  for the arch-conservative  Tea Party.  Because you already have them.  Then you got them.  They probably,  Romney is fairly moderate  compared to some  religious conservatives.  And I felt he should have  probably gotten somebody  who was a little bit moderate  because that balance,  you want to get those people  who aren't too sure  where to go. 
[02:08:00]  You're not going to get  the hardcore black vote  any more than Obama  is going to get  the Tea Party.  Well, Jimmy,  this all goes down  to battleground states.  And there was some  inside polling data  that showed that  the Tea Party vote  could push a few  of the battleground states  over to the Romney side.  And Romney is already  considered a huge moderate,  huge potential rhino,  Republican in name only,  by a lot of people.  And because of Romney care.  He might have had  to shore it up  with Ryan then.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  But they made the mistake  with Palin.  They thought that they  thought that they needed  something,  someone who was pro-life.  They needed to get  this arch-conservative  vice president.  And they fucked up.  I think Ryan's  a much better candidate  than she was.  I think it was more so  her lack of experience  and her inability  to really communicate  things to other people  that did her in  more so than her policy.  No, no, I mean  the reasons for getting her  though were I think  that because they felt  McCain was too moderate.  And we don't know  where those discussions 
[02:09:00]  of the other candidates  were and if there were  personality issues.  But I think with Ryan,  here's a guy who's been  a good soldier.  Here's a guy who can  hold his own in a debate.  And here's a policy wonk  who's already put numbers  on the table that the Tea Party  and fiscal conservatives  salivate over.  And so he's going  to be there.  And if he brings in  Ohio, Pennsylvania  and Wisconsin,  then Florida  is a coin flip  and Rami has  a really good shot.  So here's the guy  who might bring  the flyover states 
[02:09:30]  into red territory  for the first time  in a hundred years.  So this could be  a game changer,  Paul Ryan.  And the election's  down to three states,  right?  Or you said four,  I guess.  Michigan, Ohio,  and Florida.  That's it.  Yeah, and Pennsylvania  is in play.  Every other day  they'll flip.  But the rest of the states  have already made  their decision.  How weird is that?  Doesn't that kind of show  you that those three  or four states  are the only states  that are actually thinking?  Like, if you're  a swing state, 
[02:10:00]  that means you're  not an asshole  whose mind has been  made up before  you hear the facts.  It's almost stupid  to vote if you live  in New York.  Right, I agree.  For New York,  you're outnumbered  five to one.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Like, in New York,  it's a guarantee  that Obama's got  New York.  So it's going to be  60 days from today.  We have 60 days.  Wow.  60 days.  The ads that we saw  in Charlotte  on the TV,  you couldn't turn  the channel.  Oh, I'm sure.  It's just totally 
[02:10:30]  demonizing Ryan and Romney.  Sure.  But we'll see.  So I think  it's going to be cool.  Michael Steele  told me yesterday,  I did 10 minutes  with him on the air,  he thinks it's going  to be the closest  election in our lifetimes.  Wow.  No other than  Bush Gore.  Did you comment  to Michael Steele  on how he looks  like an Ethiopian nickel?  How did you know  what I said to him?  I've seen an Ethiopian nickel.  Do you really have one?  He's really creepy looking.  Is he?  He's like a black skeletor. 
[02:11:00]  He's a giant.  He's tall, too.  He's really tall.  But a nice guy.  Glad to hear it.  Yeah, all right.  All right there, Stunty.  Thank you for your  commentary  and your visions,  your take  on the Democratic  National Convention.  We didn't ask him  about James Taylor.  Eh, fuck James Taylor.  James Taylor was boring.  Mark Anthony did a killer  job on the anthem, though.  What a set of pipes.  Foo Fighters sounded great.  Who signed the anthem?  Mark Anthony.  Mark Anthony.  And the Foo Fighters  were rocking the play.  Why was James Taylor boring? 
[02:11:30]  It's just...  Because he's James Taylor.  James Taylor, come on.  Did he do  Carolina on My Mind  or whatever it's called?  I'm sure.  If you want to rock out,  you don't want to hear  how sweet it is.  Come on.  I hate that song.  I like one song by him.  He is so irritating to me.  Fire and Rain.  The rest of the stuff  he does is just  bugs me.  You've got a friend.  Really?  I think he stinks.  Do I? 
[02:12:00]  I know he's great,  but I do not enjoy  James Taylor  except for one song.  All right.  Bye, Mike.  By the way,  someone in Charlotte  saying Charlotte  has great wine  and that you're just  a drunk.  It really is.  That's possible, too.  All right.  All the madness  is on TheBlaze.com.  You can check it out  and please follow me  on Twitter.  It's StuntBrain.  Okay, buddy.  StuntBrain on Twitter  and TheBlaze.com.  There you go.  Thank you, Stunty.  All right, buddy.  Goodbye.  We'll talk soon. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, he does a good phone  on that StuntBrain, huh?  He was there.  He was in the middle of it,  in the mix.  We're going to break  and then stupid Guy Fieri  will be cooking us breakfast.  Oh, fuck.  We're going into the  We didn't even promote this.  Fishbowl.  What is he cooking today?  And is he going to force you  to drink again, Sam?  Well, I didn't drink it last night.  Sam's got a problem.  You do have a problem  with Guy Fieri.  And I agree.  Guy Fieri forced you  to eat steak  and he tried to...  I mean, no,  I voluntarily ate the steak.  Barely.  It was like...  And then he made you 
[02:13:00]  wash it down with vodka.  No, he lied and said,  here, take some water  that's hot.  And I said, okay.  And he squirted vodka  in my mouth  after he had already  been informed  that I don't drink alcohol.  You know those little  plastic bottles  that the cooks use  and they squeeze things  into the pans?  He had one of those,  a clear one,  and it was clear liquid in it.  And he goes,  here, have some water.  Tilt your head back.  And he's like,  oh, I think it's water.  He squirted vodka  in Sam's mouth.  How did he know  Sam wasn't like  a recovering alcoholic  or something?  That was the dumbest fucking...  That was a very  irresponsible thing to do. 
[02:13:30]  Are you going to take him  to test today?  You should.  Or are you going to be  like E-Rock  and just kind of go,  oh, it's okay, Leo.  Oh, E-Rock.  It's not okay.  So we'll get into it  with him.  Fat lump of shit  almost got off  unscathed today.  Yes.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  And I got to plug  something before we go.  Because all you people  that asked me  to come back to Irvine,  I'm coming back to Irvine  the 13th, 14th, 15th,  and you're not buying tickets.  This is why I don't  honor requests  to people like,  hey, could you come  to this place?  Irvine was amazing  last time I went.  Yeah.  And this time  people aren't buying tickets.  So I'm going 
[02:14:00]  the 13th, 14th, and 15th.  And then on November 3rd,  Amy Schumer, myself,  Artie Lang,  and Dave Attell  are doing Mystic Lake  in Minnesota.  Tickets go on sale,  pre-sale, today.  Tickets are on sale,  but pre-sale is today,  10 a.m.,  whatever the time zone  is out there.  My Twitter,  I just put up the link  to that.  But it's fucking depressing.  It's like I'm going  to Irvine,  and it's like,  it was amazing.  It was one of the best 
[02:14:30]  clubs I've ever done,  honestly.  Yeah, I remember  you talking about it.  How long ago did you go?  Over a year.  I don't go within a year.  I never go back too soon.  Oh, I thought it was  last week.  Oh, that would have  made sense.  Dude, that was  an hour and a half.  Fuck.  Yeah, I got a tanko.  What time is Scott  Fierry here?  Yeah, I got to go wee-wee.  I think he's already cooking.  Well, he was a little late,  luckily.  But you know what?  Then tell him to go home.  Was he drinking?  I will.  Oh, yeah, you would, actually.  You would.  No, I want to hear  the confrontation.  Okay.  As long as we can hear it  over his bracelets jinkling. 
[02:15:00]  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Let's save the ugliness.  Let's get for heaters.  That's a little personal.  All right.  Guy Fierry and Sam  going at it next.  And hopefully some  delicious food as well.  This is the Opie and Anthony  Channel on Sirius XM.  He's one of the biggest  comedy names in Middle  America and south of the  Mason-Dixon line.  Ladies and gentlemen,  give it up.  It's Billy the Bassman.  Where are we going?  All right, man.  Where are we going?  I'll tell you where we're 
[02:15:30]  going to go to fun and land.  He's back with an all-new  CD, Where Are We Going?  What are termites  eat for breakfast?  Oh, what, Billy?  Oak meal.  Where are we going?  Fat, uneducated slobs are  calling it a comedic  masterpiece.  Did you hear about the  lookalike competition in  China?  Yeah, everybody won.  Jim Crow is rolling in his  grave with laughter.  Fuck the...  Oh, hey.  I hate the fucking...  Just like you do.  Where are we going?  Move over, Larry the 
[02:16:00]  Cable Guy.  There's a new bland,  predictable redneck in town.  All right, what's Mary  short for?  She's got no legs.  Where are we going?  It's Billy the Bassman.  And his all-new CD,  We Are We Going?  Available now at truck stops  and cracker barrels  everywhere.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:16:30]  And another thing.  We got Guy Fieri.  He's in the fishbowl,  so we got to go down there,  I guess.  Yes, we do.  All right.  I guess we could start  it from the fishbowl.  I don't know why we didn't.  We're silly.  We like to walk.  This is our home right here.  This is our home.  Oh, wow.  We never played the last  Obama clip.  Yeah.  I'm sure we'll hear it  20,000 times.  So we're good?  Between here and the election.  We're good then. 
[02:17:00]  By the way, can I...  We were just asking  officially for votes.  That was our election coverage.  Yeah.  Something that made me nauseous.  Aw.  I just found out  the pre-sale code  is LOLTOUR.  Nice.  Ew.  For which one?  For the...  For the mystic,  like, you know.  The what?  For the gig I'm doing  in November with Amy  and...  The entity social.  LOLTOUR.  LOLTOUR.  Who came up with that?  I don't know.  Whoever it is, though,  I hope they're in the hospital  right now,  and they're finding  a lump somewhere.  LOLTOUR.  Ugh. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, Jim.  Eh, what's a secret word  anyway, right?  Let's go to Minnesota.  Secret word is LOLTOUR!  Ah!  I figured that would be  a fun place to do an event.  We've never been there.  Minneapolis or whatever,  Mystic Lake?  Let's go.  Right now?  Yeah, man.  Let's leave right now.  All right.  Got a couple vans.  Hey, what's Chuck Norris saying?  Chuck Norris is basically  saying...  I'm wearing a wig.  Our freedom is being lost  little by little  in our country,  and we've got to get  our freedom back. 
[02:18:00]  All right, Chuck,  one-word answer.  Stallone,  Jean-Claude Van Damme,  Bruce Willis,  and Arnold Schwarzenegger,  and you in a fight,  who emerges?  Who lasts?  He's in the Stars  and the X-Men.  In real life?  Maybe without his wig,  but...  It's all about Chuck Norris?  Who takes Stallone  and Schwarzenegger?  They're playing sound effects.  All right.  He is Chuck Norris.  All right, sir,  thank you very much.  They've become goofballs.  He looks good, though.  Is he Chuck for his age?  No.  Chuck is, like,  70s.  Is he really?  Oh, then he looks good.  But that could be  the worst hairpiece ever.  Oh, it's terrible. 
[02:18:30]  He doesn't have  Bowflex ads  or whatever the fuck  it is that thing.  Oh, Chuck Norris said  if Obama's re-elected...  Is he moving?  Wait, is he a Romney  or an Obama guy?  Oh, he's a Romney guy.  He has to be, right?  Oh, yeah.  So if Obama's re-elected,  we're going to get  a thousand years of darkness.  Oh.  How about that?  I think that's what  he said yesterday.  No, I think he said  I'm going to dip my hair  in soy sauce and eat it.  Oh, that's like Liam Neeson.  I knew it was something like that.  I'm going to eat it  like a fucking soy crisp. 
[02:19:00]  Soy sauce.  You've ruined soy sauce for me.  I can't use it anymore  without thinking of  using it as a hair dye.  Liam Neeson from Taken?  And his hair dye.  There's going to be another  Taken movie.  Taken 2.  Taken 2.  Electric Boogaloo.  The first one didn't suck bad enough.  Yeah.  I like Taken.  A lot of people did.  It's terrible.  I just like the action.  Yeah, me too.  Very believable story.  He looks under the bed.  I sense she was kidnapped.  Shut up.  I think he found  the cell phone under the bed.  Men are in your apartment.  They're going to take you. 
[02:19:30]  Here's what you need to do.  Just an idiot.  That was kind of creepy, though.  Run really stupidly.  Yeah, exactly.  We had her on the show, remember?  Yes.  She's fucking cute.  She was really hot.  Yeah.  You didn't get excited  when he told the guy,  I'm going to find you  and then I'm going to kill you?  No.  And then he found the guy?  And then he killed the guy?  Crazy, right?  Who are you?  My name's Sam Roberts.  Oh, hi, Sam.  I own a mansion and a yacht.  That's right.  Sam's now 29.  We were laughing hysterically over that.  Fuck, man, right?  He's pushing 30.  We had his big birthday show here yesterday.  I had to have it for myself. 
[02:20:00]  What?  No, I wished a happy birthday.  I thought he was lying.  I thought he was like,  oh, you know.  How are you 29 now?  Can I walk down there?  Yeah, we should go.  We should go.  Oh, yeah?  Right now?  What are we doing?  Let's just go down there and do this.  I don't let him wait.  He forced vodka and poor Sam.  I'm good with him waiting.  Here's what we do.  Everybody's got to walk down separately  and then you've got to get on mic there  and then we've got to...  Oh, we have to take a single break anyway.  No, we don't.  We could go one by one.  Oh, we don't have to?  Nah.  All right, let's just go one by one. 
[02:20:30]  And then Jim could say hello,  I've reached the studio  and then it could go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is cool.  It's like Apollo 13.  Yeah.  I don't want to be last.  Going to the lunar module.  What's the matter?  I don't want to be last.  You could go next.  Oh.  Rock, paper, scissor?  That's a great way to figure it out.  The rock, paper, scissor.  I always do scissor.  Do you always do scissor?  Always.  It's the only way to go.  That is a great psych out.  I made that announcement before you.  I always go scissor. 
[02:21:00]  So you at least get the first one.  Oh.  But.  Because then you throw the rock  and he's going to throw paper.  I always go scissor.  You always go scissor.  Always.  You ready?  Yeah.  Are you going to?  Best out of three?  Best out of three.  And are we going on,  is it rock, paper, scissor, shoot  or rock, paper, scissor,  rock, paper, scissor, shoot, go  or go on shoot?  I just go one, two, three.  One, two, three, shoot.  Oh, that's what you do.  I always go scissor.  One, two, three, shoot. 
[02:21:30]  Oh.  I told you.  I always go scissor.  It was two scissors,  ladies and gentlemen.  It was a tie.  All right.  One, two, three, shoot.  I smash them scissors.  I always go scissors.  Smash them scissors.  One, two, three, shoot.  Oh.  Ant wins the battle.  The scissor.  Yes, rock beats scissor.  I thought you had it twice.  Yeah, he beats you twice. 
[02:22:00]  He did scissor every time.  Well, because I say I always go scissor.  All right.  Here we go.  One, two, three, shoot.  He did it again.  See you?  Just scissor rock, scissor rock, scissor rock.  See, it proves you know me after 18 years.  I thought I would trick you a little bit.  Most people would go like,  I'm going to go paper because he's got to go rock.  Right.  No, you just do scissor every time.  I always go scissor.  Hi, Kenny.  Hello.  Who goes next?  Do we have the connection to the studio yet?  When we hear Jimmy. 
[02:22:30]  One by one, so we're going to have to take a break.  Oh, there we go.  Who's this?  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  He can't hear us.  We can't talk to each other?  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Jimmy, can you hear me?  We're trying to reach Jimmy Naughton.  Sam, just talk here.  I can't hear myself.  Okay.  He can't hear us.  Oh.  When we get down there, we'll start talking,  but we're not going to be able to hear you.  All right.  Do the after show for like one minute.  Okay.  I'm just worried about people tuning out is the only thing.  Well, I would too. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, is that Jim?  No, he can't hear us.  What did he say?  Okay.  Mars is working on the board right now.  Oh, has left the building.  Ant is working on his computer things.  Well, I'm going to, um, I'm actually going to leave this up for the people, you know,  on it.  There's no camera, but just don't do it.  There you go.  All right.  Have fun.  Oh, I got you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, that, that makes sense to me.  Doesn't it?  Okay.  Anthony's checking my phones.  Both the good boy phone and the naughty boy phone. 
[02:23:30]  The broken naughty boy phone.  There's like a hole in it now.  How did that happen?  There's like a hole in the back.  I dropped it in the back shatter, but now pieces of the glass are falling out, and it's leaving  like holes.  No, I could a minute ago, but I can't now.  Mars is like fucking pointing at you.  All right, let me go.  You could hear him?  I can, well, yeah, I could hear him the whole time, though.  Oh, he can down there?  All right, so everything here is good, then.  Okay.  Okay, we just, what, are you getting nervous about the air, dead air?  No, not really.  Oh, okay.  Do you get upset that they made fun of your shirt today? 
[02:24:00]  Not at all.  You have, that's your new thing, to wear MMA shirts that are styled after corporate logos.  You mean like my other, like my other, what's the other one I have?  Subway, instead of Subway, Submit.  Yeah.  It's dumb.  I don't know if you're on the air or not.  I can't hear anything.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, you did hear me?  Yes.  Oh, okay, okay.  Yes.  Okay.  They can't hear me.  We're on, Anthony, so come down.  Okay, it looks like we're about to start the show.  I can't hear anything in my mic.  Me neither.  No, they can't hear them. 
[02:24:30]  I can hear you.  Can you hear me?  Nope.  Why is Jim's the only mic that works?  No.  Oh, boy.  Troy Kwan is running that for us.  Oh, now I can hear.  Okay.  There they go.  Okay, well, I can't, so it's probably my, here comes Anthony, so.  Guy Fieri, what's up, buddy?  Can I have a headset that works?  My headset works.  Guys, you look, you look like you just woke up.  Are we on?  There's some cool Elvis playing out there.  Oh, really? 
[02:25:00]  Elvis doing some Beatles.  Elvis doing some Beatles tunes or something.  I think we're on.  Okay.  That's good.  I think we're on.  Yeah, no, I know I look road hard and put away wet.  You look a little rough.  What's the matter?  Dude, it's not because I've been out partying.  Trust me, we're opening this restaurant in New York, and this is no simple task.  I mean, it's.  Not opening a restaurant, yeah?  Well, opening a restaurant is no simple task.  Opening a restaurant in a city that you're not from.  Yeah.  You know, and training a whole new staff, and it's a little bit of a.  Times Square?  Times Square, 44th Street.  44th Street?  Ooh. 
[02:25:30]  Yep.  And what type of fare will we be looking to dine on at that said restaurant?  Russian-Chinese.  Russian-Chinese.  It's something you don't see every day.  You've probably been looking for something.  That's what Yakov serves in Branson at my restaurant.  In Branson.  Authentic linen napkins and metal magnetic tray.  Right.  Look up the video.  You'll love it.  Is that true?  Is it really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God, yeah.  What is this?  Yakov's Dinner Adventure. 
[02:26:00]  And it's Yakov doing a show, and you get a chicken cordon bleu, vegetable medley, and  the dessert.  It's not real.  It looks like the worst possible thing you could ever be experiencing.  It looks like shitty food.  It looks horrible.  And the thing is, the seats that you sit in are literally like theater seats.  But it's like, Saul, people ask, how do you eat this?  Well, we have magnetic trays that stick to the armrest.  Yeah.  And real silverware and genuine linen napkins. 
[02:26:30]  Like, they're promoting the fact that you could wipe your mouth with cloth, and that's  like a selling point.  Look at this crappy Russian show.  This is Yakov Smirnoff?  Oh, yeah.  Yakov is in Branson, Missouri, cooking up shitty things still.  Yeah.  The vegetables and the meat are the same color.  Oh, yeah.  That's never good.  Vegetable medley.  That's never good.  Pre-chewed.  Huh?  Pre-chewed.  Yeah.  We've kind of been...  No, the whole concept, it's called Guy's American Kitchen and Bar, which the bar part,  I know you guys would get that, but it's no pun intended. 
[02:27:00]  It's kind of...  It's not an American comfort food place.  A lot of people walked in like, oh, it's going to be fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  Maybe it's my guy, American, kind of spin on what I do with food in my other restaurants  and kind of stuff I learn around the country and just to...  It's pretty eclectic pretty well.  Let's see.  I go in there.  What do you recommend?  Steak?  I actually...  You know, I can't show up and not make you guys something to eat, so I had to roll in  with food.  My poor guys, my culinary team, the Cubans here, my culinary team that worked till two  in the morning had to bring all this stuff and get it all set up so we could bring you 
[02:27:30]  some food.  Oh, nice.  Why don't you do all that?  Oh, because it doesn't fit in my hotel.  It's a little awkward to be running in with the pan and the fillets.  People would expect it, though.  They'd be like, look, I knew it.  Well, they all want to know where the car is.  We understand, though, because we just walk in and everything's ready for us to go.  Well, some things are ready.  The headsets aren't always pushed.  Good point.  If a guy was working the same way we do, he'd turn that on, it would explode in his  face.  That's how ready we are every morning.  Your biggest fan is here, so... 
[02:28:00]  Oh, listen, I've already...  Oh, boy.  Hey, I'm going to tell you, I think we both got duped in that show.  Oh, man.  The last time you were here?  Listen, well, listen, I ran into some guys.  I was down...  I heard about it.  I said, you know, oh, he's all pissed off about the vodka thing.  That was not my fault.  What?  It was not...  What?  You really gonna...  Oh, so you are...  You did it.  You are upset.  Like, I knew it was vodka.  Oh.  I can't tell the difference between the water and the vodka.  The bottles are mismatched.  Okay, well, then Guy Fieri's goofy smile when he's looking at you guys showing the bottle 
[02:28:30]  that says vodka written on it.  I didn't see that.  I didn't see that in the video.  So now you're making fun of my smile.  You're hurting my inside.  You're hurting my feeling.  Well, that's good, then.  Make fun of his hair, then.  What?  My hair is...  I don't know who you're talking to.  I don't know who you're talking to.  Either one of us.  Isn't that great that each one didn't know who I was talking to?  That's just something.  I'll take deep, but I truly apologize.  If you don't drink, that was wrong.  It would have been fun if you were a drinker.  But he knew I didn't drink, though.  Oh, that makes it fun, right?  I'm not sure that I was that confused.  I don't think he knew, did he?  Yeah, he did.  You told me.  I think you're lying, Sam.  That was the whole shtick.  Sam, I think you lied. 
[02:29:00]  Sam, why don't you relax?  Yeah, really?  Let it go.  Why don't you yell at our guests?  You're really making me feel uncomfortable.  Jesus.  Well, I felt very uncomfortable last time you were talking.  Would you like me to drink?  Yes, I would.  Okay, fantastic.  Sam, why don't you have some to make up?  Yeah, go on, Eddie.  That's the whole thing.  It's about celebration.  Yeah, let it go.  There we go.  Are we over this now?  I mean, really, I apologize.  You cooked you a nice steak.  Guy, pass him your crack pipe.  I do want to.  I do want to.  I mean, you made me feel bad.  I make you perfectly good food.  You spit it out. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, shit.  You thought it was disgusting.  I didn't like it.  Remember that?  Well, I can't help it.  I can't make chicken McNuggets, man.  Food is.  Baby food.  Ah, stupid kid.  Sam eats baby food.  But I do like chicken nuggets.  This is backfiring on you, Sam.  He's killing you.  No, but Sam, I do want this.  This is really very serious.  Straight up.  I mean, that's not.  I didn't know you were upset about it.  I thought this was everything.  It's no holds barred in this group.  Everything's fair to go.  But, you know, I just thought that was the way it was.  Is there forgiveness in the Robert's heart?  Or do you just hold a grudge like the JDL?  He's saying he didn't realize you were a pussy. 
[02:30:00]  He's like, I thought everything was no holds barred.  Is that what you're saying?  I didn't realize that you were going to fucking put on a dress and cry about it.  That's not what I'm saying.  That's Jim saying that, not you.  That's not me saying that.  I kind of heard that too, though, Sam.  I back up Jim's point.  Well, I can accept the apology if the pussy thing isn't involved.  I did not call you pussy.  Do you think I'm a pussy?  Who said that?  I'm asking you.  There was one.  Huh?  Do you think I'm a pussy?  No, no, no, no, no.  You don't?  No.  All right. 
[02:30:30]  Even everyone else does.  You got to think he's a pussy.  Hold on.  You got to think he's a pussy for not eating steak.  Listen, I think there's a whole issue going on there with him not eating real food.  But that's not me.  I'm not his parents.  Mommy issues.  I'm not his parents.  I mean, I'm just disappointed that you were so upset about that.  I thought that this was.  Again, I just thought this was.  You bring it in.  It's all ha ha fun, fun.  People move past it.  I mean, I'm really going to have to watch what I say.  Maybe I should just get into cooking now.  Oh, man.  That's true.  A little raucous.  That's true.  It might be better for the show.  Yeah.  He thought we were a little more raucous than this, Sam. 
[02:31:00]  You're making us look bad.  Okay.  Well, I'm going to break out with that.  You thought we were an edgy show.  I have Melba toast and tuna fish that I'm going to be cooking at next.  Oh, God.  I don't need tuna fish.  Thanks, Sam.  We look like fucking assholes, man.  Fucking God.  Yeah, I thought this was going to be a fun time, and I didn't realize that you were going  to fucking put on a pair of Spanx and cry about it like a fucking.  I took umbrage with something that took place last time, but Guy has apologized.  Listen, it's all good.  You heard an apology there?  Would you try some of my food now, since I've apologized to you? 
[02:31:30]  Will you try something different today?  Well, I mean, I'll try it, but I probably will spit it out.  So it's up to you.  Then that goes right back into the vodka thing.  And the whole evil circle continues, and then you're trashing me at the library, and I  don't need that stuff.  You're a good sport, because you cook, and then Sam spits it out.  I can't imagine that is selling reservations for the new restaurant.  No, no, no.  That's why we're not feeding them this time.  Well, you don't want people like salmon there anyway.  I like your food.  Well, I appreciate that.  You're a man of quality and taste.  By the way, I'm the good sport for being the one who ate it. 
[02:32:00]  I'm a good sport.  Eating it is swallowing it.  Guy, exactly.  You hung out with one of our favorite people, Mayor Menino.  Oh, what a cat.  What a cat, man.  Really?  Yeah, he's a great guy.  We went and took a cruise in the car, and we drove around the neighborhood.  I know that guy over there.  I know that guy over there.  Really nice guy.  He's well-connected up there, right?  I would say.  I think he's been mayor.  I think he's been mayor for, like, 20 years or something.  I think about it.  Yeah.  And everybody waved to him, too.  It was like we were on a parade. 
[02:32:30]  We got two cop cars in front of us, my car, you know, the Camaro, and then the car behind  us, and we're just driving along, and we're in just, like, a regular neighborhood  on the east side of Boston.  He's just, people were just screaming, mayor, and I thought he was throwing  a piece of shit.  We're here with Guy Fieri.  Did he notice he doesn't?  He's going to cook some of our food today here in Boston.  That's rough.  Oh, he is.  Oh, that's rough.  Did you hear his speech?  Did you hear his speech yesterday?  No.  Oh.  At the DNC.  Hold on.  That's a little rough, Ant.  Don't go crazy with the impressions. 
[02:33:00]  Don't go nuts.  Where's all the memes from?  I mean, no.  We're trying to tone it down a little bit.  Yeah.  Why is it rough that we've noticed that, you know, Mayor Menino has a huge tongue in his  mouth?  Wow.  Madonna boys here.  I love it.  Roland went to Madonna last night.  You did?  With Troy.  You, too, man.  You, too, got something going on.  Are you going to eat Guy Fieri's food today?  Oh, yes.  It's delish.  How was Madonna? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, how was it?  It was pretty bad.  Was it bad?  Why was it bad?  What's wrong with it?  It was basically a shower show, and she sings for like 40 minutes.  The rest is dancing in videos.  Ugh.  And she has snippets of her hits.  She's not really singing anymore?  She does, but she only does snippets of her hits.  Why?  Oh, I hate when they do that.  Snippets, like a whole medley of her greatest?  It's shorter, like for, like, Poppin' Don't Preach, only did, like, less than half  the song.  Wow.  Did you kiss Troy?  No.  Well, I would assume because afterwards.  Did you buy an orange car and ask Troy if he liked it? 
[02:34:00]  Afterwards, did you go back to the pool where I believe I heard on the Sam Roberts after  show, the whiny pussy baby after show, that you hold Troy's shorts, he's got swim trunks,  at your apartment.  Yeah, and his towel.  You have his towel and that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you go into the cabana and hold it against his hips and go, I think these will fit you?  No, we're bros.  And he goes, hey, Stacey.  No, we're bros.  All in the pool, huh?  No, we're bros.  What has happened to you guys since I was here last? 
[02:34:30]  This has got, you got the angry intern, you got Madonna, you got, I mean, it's just,  it's just like, there's just so much tension.  There really is.  We need to get an aromatherapy can.  There really is.  Say, push rolling out of the way.  Angry intern.  Oh, man.  Right on the head he hit that.  That's an angry intern.  Are you all right with that?  I'm not an intern, first of all, and I'm not angry.  You are.  I'm justified.  Hey, you're, hey, Troy, you're a great kisser.  You two swimming together? 
[02:35:00]  This is great iced tea.  Oh, man.  They're bros.  They were bro-ing down.  Fucking Damone and Fast Times.  Yeah.  That was perfect.  I fucking love it.  Better than the morning mashup, right?  It's like, Joe.  More, more anger.  But I want to know, I want to hear from the angry intern.  You're absolutely right.  That's a great name for you now.  How long have you been interning?  Bam.  I'm not, I'm actually a producer slash on-air host, if you look to see me.  Slash intern.  Slash intern.  There's no intern involved.  No.  Basically, what he's saying, he's a glorified intern. 
[02:35:30]  That's not a glorified intern.  Anytime there's a slash in it, it's glorified.  Yeah.  No, it's just.  After the slash is to make you feel better.  No, before the slash is to make them feel better.  You want to hurt anyone else around here today?  I am just.  Jesus, right?  I know, guys.  I don't, I mean, I'm hearing you.  Well, a dressed guy, he said you were a good intern.  I apologize again.  Let me just start off with a general.  That's two for me.  Two points.  Two zero.  Two zero right now.  Two zero?  What do you get the score on?  What is the score?  Yeah, I get two points, you get none so far.  Because I got two apologies.  Do you want like a, like a little teddy bear for that? 
[02:36:00]  Anything from the, nothing from the top row, nothing from the top row, nothing on this  side or this side, but something right in this area.  That's a little rough.  We don't want to go there.  That's a little rough.  You're basically losing two to nothing, though, because he's got-  I'm not losing.  I got two apologies.  Yeah, but he's wounded you twice.  You haven't wounded him at all.  I'm not wounded.  So he's up two woundings to nothing.  And his apologies aren't sincere.  I've hurt you.  They're not sincere.  And I'll continue going on hearting you.  When are we going to get our steak?  I'm trying to work on the steak right now. 
[02:36:30]  I'm just trying to get through the insults and the apologies.  I mean, it's hard to cook in between all that.  Insults and apologies.  Welcome to insults and apologies.  That is a great new cooking show.  In the morning.  You insulters, you apologize.  You insult.  When does your restaurant open up?  I think it's going to probably be Monday morning.  Monday for lunch.  Right around the corner.  Yeah.  Oh, you've got to wait until you see this thing.  Do we get to go to the grand opening?  16,000 square feet.  I'll be coming back to New York.  We'll do the grand opening.  That means no.  No, no, no.  It does.  It means yes.  It means yes.  It means we're going to wait until we get- 
[02:37:00]  We're going to work out the kinks.  It's October 9th will be when we do the big-  Will that be like red carpet and celebrities?  I don't know what color the carpet will be, but you can come on down.  It'll be easy.  Yeah.  Here we go.  What's wrong with a red carpet?  I don't know that we'll be-  Hey, are we going to get the big invite to Napa Valley?  You promised us last time.  What do we got?  Imus?  Oh, Napa.  Oh, hey, I like that.  What do you mean don't start?  What do you mean don't start?  Didn't we already do the invite?  We said, come out, let's do the show.  It was a fake invite.  No, that was not a shallow invite. 
[02:37:30]  We want an actual invite.  Would you like it written?  Yes.  What is going on?  An apology for the shallowness of the first one.  Yeah, now I want an apology for the invite.  That's it.  That's it.  Three to nothing.  I apologize for not apologizing.  Oh, man.  There you go.  Keep track.  Keep track over there.  Sam, if you think this is points for you-  It's three points.  Then feel better about yourself.  Exactly.  It's not three points.  Hey, don't listen.  You quit picking on me.  I'm going to bring the Cuban in.  Okay, I'll put him on mic.  He will just-  It'll be-  I'm telling you.  I don't know.  He's angry. 
[02:38:00]  He's angry.  He can kill you.  Destroy.  I think the Cuban should destroy him.  Call him out.  Call him out.  Well, I don't have any issues with any Cuban.  No, but I don't think the Cuban has anything.  He doesn't like you.  Why not?  The Cuban doesn't like you.  And I don't think the Cuban has anything.  Exactly.  Call him out.  He's a pan-  Listen, you guys are lying out of the cage.  You're hurt.  The cage out of the tiger.  The guy said that you looked fat in that dress, and you're upset about it.  And the Cuban's going to come in and do something.  What does the Cuban have?  Hey, is pan-fried steak harder to make than thrown in a broiler or something?  You asking me?  It just depends on what kind of steak you're trying to make. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah?  I like doing a pan-fried steak when you're doing something like a filet.  It doesn't have a lot of fat.  It doesn't really do well on the-  I don't think it does as well on the barbecue.  But in this situation where I'm building a sauce that's going along with it-  Ah, so it's almost marinating in the pan.  Well-  All right, maybe it's not.  That's as good as what you call it.  I have no idea.  I just throw shit on the grill out back.  It smells very good in here.  You know, I have a nice stove, and I don't even know how to work the goddamn thing properly.  Stove out.  And I just go to my yard and fire up the barbecue in January.  I'll tell you how.  You open it, and you turn on the fucking gas, and put your head in it, and think things 
[02:39:00]  over.  Make your decisions.  No, I have a big wolf stove.  Big wolf stove.  If my guy over, he'll give you a lesson.  Oh, yeah?  You want to go to the compound?  Is it the wolf stove?  I don't know.  It's a good place.  Is it a nice place to be?  Yes, it is.  I don't ever hear the show coming from the compound, live from the compound.  I do live from the compound, but that's my own show.  It's my webcast.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's video. 
[02:39:30]  It's a video webcast.  It's crazy.  You know, Guy is very insulting, but man, his food smells good.  It smells really good, man.  I've got to give you that much.  He's insulting.  Sam's agreeing wholeheartedly right there.  Of course he is.  As he thinks he's getting more points.  Sam, you going to try this steak today again?  No.  We're not going.  We're not going.  No, I mean...  Ah, good.  Don't waste it on it, Guy.  You're right, Guy.  My feeling was hurt.  Fuck, Sam.  But you hear Guy's like, no, that ain't happening.  He doesn't want the negative feedback.  Did you hear Guy say his feelings were hurt?  Four points.  Feeling.  Feeling. 
[02:40:00]  You have one.  You haven't got the center.  You haven't got the core.  All right, that's three and a half, then.  Three and a half points.  I don't think you get points for being hypersensitive, Sam.  It wasn't hypersensitive.  I was justified, and that's why he apologized.  I don't know.  He doesn't sound very apologetic.  He apologized three times already.  That's very apologetic.  Yeah, that's what he's doing.  He's handling you the way we mostly handle our girlfriends.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're right.  You're right.  I didn't listen.  I apologize.  I apologize.  Well, I mean, it sounded sincere to me.  Of course it did.  It always does.  That's how she stops talking.  Yep, you make it sound sincere.  You see how he cut that?  You're a little bitch. 
[02:40:30]  I don't think so.  I know you don't, but everyone else does.  How do you learn how to chop like that?  What's in there?  I was just going to say that.  I can't have vodka.  No.  How do you chop like that?  That was effortless.  Yes.  You chop about, they come in flats.  You chop enough of these over enough years.  What it is is you roll your fingers back a little bit like that.  So if you are going to cut something, you cut the top of your knuckle.  You don't cut the tip of your finger.  Right.  The knuckle is not as nearly as big of a deal as the finger is. 
[02:41:00]  Right.  It's not hurt, though, anyway.  Ah, what a little.  Look at that.  That's a cool little trick.  Yeah, well.  Have you cut some digits over the years?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've had some digits over the years.  What's the best work-related injury you've ever had?  Nice big gash or a burn?  I was doing a show.  This actually, I was doing a show in Rhode Island and, no, in upstate New York.  And I came out and I had a big audience, 2,500 people, big cooking demonstration.  All these chefs were there.  It was a big weekend of cooking.  And I came out and I was into it for like 30 seconds.  I walk out and I'm doing that. 
[02:41:30]  I'm talking and cutting.  And I came down on the back of the knife on the middle of my thumb and just cracked it  open.  And it was just, oh, it was vicious.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  It was, the blood was all cold and blue as it came out.  And so I had to sit there for the next two hours with a towel, like a tourniquet, not  telling anybody.  I'd wrapped it up like this.  Oh, God, that hurts.  Oh, my God.  And the whole thing, I did the whole demonstration, no one said anything.  And then all of a sudden, at the very end of it, a little girl walks up and goes,  Chef Fietti, did you almost cut your finger?  Here's 20 bucks, kid.  Shut up. 
[02:42:00]  Sure.  I'll make you plead now.  Yeah.  You give them the money and they're quiet.  All right, Uncle Paul.  Very good.  Sure.  Here's 20.  Keep it between us.  Give me a nickel.  Wow, that back of the knife.  Holy shit.  Is the alcohol cooked out of the wine?  You know what?  The alcohol does cook out, but not all the way.  So I tell people all the time, if you have an issue with alcohol, don't hang out with  you.  Can you make a different one? 
[02:42:30]  Can you make a different one?  Was that a little rabbit punch out there?  I'm just having a general conversation.  That was a rabbit punch by the intern.  Let's move past that.  That was a little slap.  He threw like a little girl slap.  Let's move past this.  I think it's time for the Cuban.  God, could you cook up the wine for Jimmy without any booze?  There's already booze in the pan.  I won't need that.  Oh, man.  Do you have another pan to cook a steak without the wine for Jim Norton?  That's okay, man.  I don't want to.  I just can't.  I can't.  No, I can't do that.  I'll give mine to a Roland.  Or to Troy.  All right, fuck Troy. 
[02:43:00]  I want to taste some of this.  Yeah.  None for Sam.  Stupid Sam Roberts.  Are we on the air even?  Yeah, we are.  I can hear you.  I couldn't hear me before.  What?  Go, man, go.  I'm just going to have a little.  Don't have it all.  Don't insult him.  I'm just having a little.  Wait, wait, wait.  Great video there.  Yeah, E-Rock, of course.  He's got his fucking video thing.  What technique is he using to eat?  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  You only made one steak?  No, I made two.  I made two.  He made two. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, my God.  I'll make you one without some wine.  It is so good.  You want some steak or not?  No, because it's.  You don't have to.  Because I'm.  No, he's going to wipe out the pan.  No, I have to do it.  Okay.  That's really good.  I'll just give mine to Roland.  Let Roland have it.  No.  Screw Roland.  I'd love to.  That's why I'm giving him my food.  That's the key.  While he's eating, you fuck him.  He doesn't move.  He's like a deer drinking water.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God. 
[02:44:00]  That's good.  Oh, thank you.  God damn.  I don't know how you make.  I'm like Sam.  I'm very thankful.  I'm just taking a pan.  Yeah, Sam really is a take for granted kind of guy.  I'm so thankful.  What do I take for granted?  You got a big star chef cooking for you and you just.  All you can do is insult him because he fucking.  I didn't insult him.  He's jabbing.  I told him I took offense to something he did and he apologized like he should have.  God damn.  I would love to make fun of this, but holy shit.  Well, that's what we do, you know. 
[02:44:30]  That's how I work through my anger issues is cooking.  Really?  That's really, yeah.  Very flavorful.  Do you find it relaxing?  Because I have a great kitchen for New York and I can't cook for shit.  I just can't do it.  No.  You know what I tell you?  What I think makes people stumble when they're cooking is they get too, they're too expectant.  They think, oh, I got to do so great and I had this dish before.  I read the recipe and it should be so easy and I fail at it.  I mean, it takes its time and tenure.  You got to kind of learn the tricks of the trade and don't burn the garlic.  And, you know, just these little pieces make a big difference.  What do you guys think though? 
[02:45:00]  This is called Steak Diane.  This is one of the dishes at Guy's American.  This will be in the new restaurant?  Yeah.  Wow.  And this is an old school recipe.  I mean, this is one of the first things I cooked when I was a kid when I was a flambé  captain at the fine dining restaurant in the area that I grew up.  And it's one of those dishes that, I mean, you get it.  It's got to have a lot of this really rich sauce.  You've got demi-glaze in there.  You got a little Worcestershire, some red wine, a little butter, the mushrooms, the garlic,  the shallots.  All works together.  You should try that with some garlic, rosemary, mashed potatoes we do.  But we didn't bring those, did we, Cuban? 
[02:45:30]  Oh, boy.  The Cuban let you down, too.  No, no, no.  The Cuban can't let me down.  This guy, this is the Cuban right here.  And this is Anthony.  And these guys are my culinary team.  And they've been rocking the house down there, Guy's American.  They've been there for about a month getting this ready.  And we're in a big full staff training.  We've got about 100 team members and a bunch of great chefs and killer menu.  What is the Cuban's role?  What does the Cuban do?  Are you his intern?  Yeah.  No, oh, boy.  This is, I'm telling you. 
[02:46:00]  What do you, no, I'm asking.  I don't know.  What do you do?  Are you, are you, I work with him and help him open the restaurants.  Okay.  Nice.  And I dance sometimes.  Cool.  Fair enough.  A little salsa dance.  Yes.  Salsa.  Because that's a Cuban.  We swim.  We dance.  Long distance.  Oh, gosh.  See, I told you, Sam.  You can't keep up with this shit.  It's already more entertaining than our intern who just stood there.  Intern.  Played victim.  Hey, this sauce, is that, you make that all in the pan right there?  Yeah.  You just watched him do it.  What kind of question is that? 
[02:46:30]  I know, but I guess he's in the pan.  What do you think he was pouring in the pan?  What do you think he snuck it out of his pocket?  I watched it.  Even I knew he made the sauce.  All right.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  It's so good.  It's really good.  And, like, tell me you don't need, like, some French bread to just dip that in, too.  I was just thinking of that.  Yeah.  Some nice French bread with the crust on there, just all marron.  So you guys, so I'm in Canada.  So we're not worth the French bread, I'm thinking.  Oh.  What happened?  What?  Oh.  The instigation is awesome.  I heard him, Sam.  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  He goes, wouldn't this be perfect with French bread?  But obviously, he knows we would be.  You don't have any.  But we don't have the French bread.  That's so good.  What were you going to say about Canada?  Yeah, Canada.  I was going to say, I was up in Canada doing Triple D, and I guess they get XM up there  and Sirius, and they were a bunch of people.  Oh, man, I heard you on the show.  But a whole group, I mean, not like one or two people.  There was, like, 50 people, and random times would come up.  So you've got a big following up there, right?  Yeah.  Nice folks in awesome, awesome restaurants.  Have you ever been to Vancouver?  Oh, killer.  I've never been to Vancouver. 
[02:47:30]  I'm doing a gig in Vancouver at the Rickshaw Theater in November.  Well, let's talk about it.  So that would be enchanting.  There's some really great restaurants up there.  I mean, they've got some bomb.  One of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever been to.  Not in the part of town.  Apparently, the Rickshaw Theater's in.  The cuisine of the day is Bullets.  They say it's a pretty shitty neighborhood I'm working in.  Is it really?  Duck.  Yeah.  Duck.  Duck, and we're sending you a free Kevlar vest.  That's pretty good.  Oh, my goodness gracious. 
[02:48:00]  I'm amazed.  What do you think?  So the way we do the food at the restaurant is it's a big restaurant.  We've got two big bars.  One, right when you walk in, there's kind of a bar.  You can hang out and watch all the people cruising down 44th.  And then upstairs, there's another bar.  Great TV, sports, food shows, the whole thing.  But the idea is to be – it's kind of like how we hang out at my house.  You know, we've got cooking going on, a lot of people hanging out.  There's TVs.  There's media.  There's this whole energy.  Chinese kids setting off firecrackers.  Almost. 
[02:48:30]  It's almost that.  But the idea is to have real food.  And it doesn't have to be real pretentious.  It doesn't have to be real expensive.  It's just cool food.  Like we do pulled pork.  We have this huge rotisserie in the dining room that we're roasting Lego lamb and roasted turkeys  and just a porchetta, which is where you roll the loin into the pork belly.  You just – all this –  Ramen noodles.  Oh, wait until you see it, man.  It is gangster.  I open a can of Progresso soup.  Really going big tonight.  I order from Grubhub.  Are you guys going to have takeout too? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  So you get on Grubhub.  It's my iPad app.  That's where you live?  It's phenomenal, though.  It's your hub for Grub, basically.  What is it?  If you want grubs sent to your house?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Little white things, and I eat them out of a dish.  As opposed to a big white puddle that you eat.  I don't eat it.  Oh, come on.  So why haven't you guys come to Cali?  What was up with that?  I mean, it was – it's a boycott.  It's a West Coast, East Coast thing?  Is it –  It's the fake invite. 
[02:49:30]  It was a fake invite.  Let me – can I get the – what the expectation is for legitimate?  Would you like something engraved?  Would you like it to be with doves?  Now he's taking shots at you.  I'm not taking shots.  You're just taking shots at Opie now.  He's asking –  Damn.  It's our attack intern.  Look out.  Jesus.  I'm on your side, Ian.  I don't know why –  That's because you're loyal to your man like most women.  Where are we going?  Bring in the Cuban.  Oh, man.  Where are we going if we go –  Get him, Cuban.  Get him.  Where are we going if we go out there?  How does this work? 
[02:50:00]  I live in Sonoma County.  What are we supposed to do?  What are we supposed to do to him?  Yeah, so far, so good.  I'm not going to fight with chicks, man.  Oh, Sam, you're a chick.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Samantha.  Yeah.  I know.  That was good, Cuban.  Being mean.  Good.  Really good, Cuban.  Really good, Cuban.  Good.  It was amazing.  I'll lend him out for you.  Well, yeah, he's just warming up.  So what happens if we go there?  What do you mean, what would you like to have happen?  Are you in the middle of nowhere up there?  No.  I'm in the wine country.  I'm about an hour north of San Fran. 
[02:50:30]  And it's –  Are you close to Duckhorn?  The winery?  Yeah.  Silver Oak?  Yeah.  Would you like to go there?  I mean, is that the only –  No, now we're talking.  No, you really –  I'm telling you, it would be a great time.  Now we're talking.  It would be a great time to have you guys up there.  And I got a bunch of restaurants up there.  And we'd –  You know, we can play golf.  We can go –  Oh, a little golf.  Duck hunting.  Go crab fishing.  Go crab fishing.  I would do that.  I mean, come on.  Tell me the things that you're –  Crab fishing.  What channel is your show –  I'm sorry.  What channel is your show on?  Food Network.  Okay.  Is that the channel?  I don't know.  I mean, different people.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:51:00]  I don't know exactly what it is.  Do you like all the Food Network people?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm pretty down with everybody.  I mean, there's –  Even the bobblehead one?  The who?  Cuban knows.  Oh, man.  That bra that's really hot, but her head's too big for her body.  What?  And she cooks for –  See, they know.  They all know who she is.  They all know.  Yeah.  The Cuban has probably been bashing her for years.  And she hates her.  And she cooks everything for her men as they're doing extreme sporting.  You can't be bashing people like that.  See, guys, I knew how to –  I like this show.  I knew how to shut them up. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  What did we start with?  Where are we –  The resident?  We've been in commercial.  Don't talk smack about my fellow Food Network stars.  I mean, come on.  She is.  She's kind of hot.  Her head wasn't so big.  Listen, that is inappropriate.  That isn't nice at all.  I will tell you this, though.  It's a crazy world what goes on at Food Network.  I mean, we've got –  Just wacky.  Just mad capped.  The zany world of Food Network.  You guys get wild?  You know what I heard?  I heard one day –  You're watching it.  Guy just squeezed vodka in everybody's mouth. 
[02:52:00]  That's the bad guy.  But wouldn't it be funny if they really did have, like, horrible pranks at the Food Network?  Like, one person puts white powder in someone else's recipe and says it's anthrax,  and they have to clear the building, and that's their idea of fun laughs?  I mean, I think that the sugar-salt thing would be funny enough, but that's a laugh.  See, that's why we're here, to help you, to up your pranks.  They don't realize how hardcore they are.  That's hilarious.  How's – who's the other one?  Rachel Ray? 
[02:52:30]  She good?  Rachel's very cool.  Rachel and I do a show together.  Roland likes Rachel Ray a lot.  It's called Rachel vs. Guy.  You know what we should get is one of you guys to come on the Rachel vs. Guy celebrity cook-off.  I only want –  That would be –  My brother's a big-time chef.  Get him on.  No, no, we need – it's just a celebrity-based thing.  Oh, well, all right.  So, we ask –  I mean, not that we don't like your bro and all, but –  I'm almost a celebrity, and he's my brother.  That's good enough.  Okay.  Well, I think we were talking more about you, or when are you guys going to –  Well, I don't need your help.  Our restaurant's doing fine.  Whoa.  Man.  I'm mad.  Well, you're justified in it. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, okay.  Now, what does this celebrity do?  Let's be honest.  Yeah, because Jimmy's very interested.  What does this celebrity on the show do?  What are you responsible for?  It's like – it's a celebrity apprentice with cooking.  Okay.  That's kind of what it is.  So, there's a challenge each week, and it'll actually be coming out.  We just shot it in L.A. in June.  It'll come out on the 1st of January.  What celebrities did you use?  I can't tell you.  Okay.  Ah, good celebrity.  Like, you couldn't go online and find it, though.  Okay.  But we're not allowed to say yes.  Were they unpopular celebrities like Bernie Madoff? 
[02:53:30]  Bernie Madoff was the first one.  Jerry Sandusky is in episode two.  They picked all the wrong people.  Show's perfect for Jim Norton.  Yeah, Jimmy would like to be on that.  Jerry teaches how to make cocktail franks.  Hopping into his mouth.  Exactly.  What's this called?  That's called the memory disappearer.  Cuban is on our side now.  You lost the Cuban.  Hey, no, he's –  You lost the Cuban.  You know that.  He takes calamari rings and then just puts red sauce in the middle of them. 
[02:54:00]  Cuban lumps that one.  Cuban, find this.  With a fat piece of sausage that shoves in and rips the calamari open.  Yes.  No, I can't have the alcohol in it.  No, not that one.  No, that was the one he made.  No, that one has alcohol in it.  Yeah, give it to Roland.  Let Roland enjoy it.  That's okay.  It smells amazing.  And I've already eaten this food.  It's great.  Roland, what was your favorite Madonna song last night?  I just didn't like – I just went for Bruce.  That's it.  What?  Bruce. 
[02:54:30]  He wasn't there, was he?  No.  Obama used the Bruce song last night.  We take care of our own.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  You went for Bruce.  That's a good song.  No, no, I just went, but I was like, eh, I don't like any of the first songs.  What did you say?  You went for Bruce?  Well, I thought, I can't wait to go see Bruce again.  Oh, I didn't understand him.  It sounded like he said, I went for Bruce.  That's what I thought he said.  I'll wait for Bruce?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you said I went for Bruce.  No.  Oh, boy, I can't understand your wait.  I heard it.  He means until he finally has sex.  I'll wait for Bruce.  Would you bang Bruce?  Yeah, why not?  After the steak, I'm ready. 
[02:55:00]  Guy, what's wrong with that?  That's awesome.  The show continues to hit new levels.  It's your idol.  It's okay.  I'm down with it.  It's not Gabe.  It's your idol.  I agree.  You guys want another steak?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, well, how about –  I'm full is the only reason.  It's awesome.  You want a bite?  No, no, because the alcohol is in the pan, I'm afraid.  But have some.  I gave mine to Roland.  It smells amazing.  It's good food, man.  It's really good.  I'm looking forward to this restaurant.  It'll be a good time.  What spot did you take over? 
[02:55:30]  It wasn't – it was actually the –  ESPN Zone?  No, it was actually the New York Times printing is one of the buildings,  one of the old New York Times buildings.  Oh, no kidding.  Right down 44th, between 7th and 8th.  So when we went in, and my business partner's guy, John Blustein,  who owns all the Heartland breweries here in New York,  real successful restaurant, dude.  And that's the only way I could do this.  I can't come into New York going from California and like,  oh, I'm going to open up in New York, which is a whole different world of restaurant.  And, I mean, Bobby Flay and Mario make it look like it's, oh, yeah,  just put one here and one there. 
[02:56:00]  Right, yeah.  So this guy, John Blustein, and I, we partnered up on this,  and he took me to the space.  He took me to his place.  He says, what do you think?  And, I mean, it's a gigantic warehouse with, you know, huge girders and cement this and that.  And, like, how are you going to put a restaurant in it?  And it's unbelievable.  It's about an $8 million build-out.  Wow.  16,000 square feet.  It's pretty out of bounds, man.  It is just the meat, just the things that they used and the materials and the style and the iron work  and all this kind of stuff that goes on.  I think you guys will dig it.  And there wasn't, we didn't have a place really where we wouldn't put the kitchen. 
[02:56:30]  They wouldn't put it upstairs because it was too far to go downstairs.  And downstairs, too far to go upstairs.  So, he built a mezzanine right in the center of the two floors, and that's where the kitchen is.  So, as you're coming down the stairs, you look through these windows, and you see the whole kitchen operation.  It's like Mission Control.  It is.  It does look like Mission Control.  And it's, man, what a crazy place.  Wow, that sounds great.  But we've been doing the training.  It's got to be $200, $300 a month, right, rent?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think a second is what it is.  $200 or $300 a second.  But we're going to do it, you know, going down. 
[02:57:00]  That's such a great area.  I mean, it's my fan base.  Are you panicking a little bit?  Yeah.  Okay.  Have you seen that in the not-so-much smut?  I'm just doing the numbers in my head.  My mind races about it.  But here's the great thing.  You get an opportunity to do it, and I couldn't do it on my own.  I couldn't come to New York.  I mean, I had to have somebody that really knew the business, and this guy is like the  supreme operator.  Someone's got a mouth for him.  Have you ever been to this place, this Heartland Brewery, brews his own beer?  It's a huge brewery in Brooklyn.  Yeah, of course.  And the guy makes just killer beers.  So, we have our own line of beers and different styles of beers, and we've got the Bakhten Loaded, 
[02:57:30]  and we have a beer that we named after my little sister, my sister Morgan, that passed  away.  We have Morgan's Red Amber Ale.  So, we've got all just kind of cool, and it's a lot of my, not like my family stuff,  but just things I'm into.  Big pictures of hot rods, you know, stuff like that.  But it's, I think you guys will dig it.  And you are definitely invited, and Reed, write it down.  Get a red carpet.  Red carpet.  Okay?  And picture, people taking pictures.  Another empty invite.  That's not an empty invite.  That was an empty invite, right, Sam?  He is just.  He didn't even give a date. 
[02:58:00]  You are not.  Thank you.  What did he invite you to?  See, because Anthony's on, no, he didn't even give a date.  I'm just.  Gallagher.  I said October 9th.  Oh.  Gallagher.  You're not even going to go carrot top?  I have hair on the top of my head.  That's too easy.  You don't look anything like Gallagher.  Young Gallagher.  You look like Gallagher.  Young Gallagher.  Young Gallagher, I guess.  Yes.  You want to squash some watermelon ones?  Oh, man.  Actually, that's a compliment.  Gallagher's a character, man.  We had him on.  That guy rocked it for a long time.  He's batshit crazy now, but, you know, whatever. 
[02:58:30]  Fun to have around.  Which is a great term, batshit crazy.  I know.  That is crazy.  We called him by his real.  Crazy, you're in a shithouse rack.  That's a good one, yep.  Patrice O'Neal called him by his real name, and man, he didn't like that.  What's his real name again?  Leo.  Leo.  Leo Gallagher.  He does not like to be called Leo.  What do you, how do you like that steak there, Roland?  Pretty fucking good, right?  It's beyond phenomenal.  I have tears in my eyes.  Good man.  Good man.  It's really good.  I'd like you to come down to have dinner on me and free cocktails, and you can bring somebody. 
[02:59:00]  Troy?  Yeah.  Or bring Troy.  I'm kidding.  You know how vague that was?  Another vague invite.  That's not.  It's an invite.  Yeah, I come here all the time.  I love the scrudel.  I'll scratch it.  Hey, I found your wallet.  I found your wallet.  I use this cookbook.  It's phenomenal.  I cook barbecue and everything.  Really?  I don't care if she comes today as lazy as a phrase.  As long as your toes are tapping.  Dude, do you know the whole movie?  Oh, I don't believe that.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:59:30]  You got him.  He does.  It's a prerequisite.  So when is Roland going to go down there?  October 9th.  Well, see, the restaurant's going to be open on Monday, but it's going to be a little bit chaotic.  Yeah.  So October 9th is-  What do they call that?  A soft opening or something like that?  Here, I'll do this.  You just call the Cuban.  You tell them when you want to come down.  Okay.  Oh, man.  That's your contact.  I like that number.  Okay, that's a little bit dangerous.  Yeah.  That's a little bit dangerous.  Thank you.  I love his cookbooks, and Triple D is awesome.  Yeah.  Have you seen the new Triple D?  Yes.  I watch every Monday.  We've been hitting some cool places.  We went to Hawaii. 
[03:00:00]  Shot some awesome places in Hawaii.  Oh, you know who else has recently been to Hawaii?  Sam went to Hawaii.  Our old Sam Roberts just got back from Hawaii.  And guess what, guy?  He did nothing.  He didn't do shit.  I relaxed.  Beautiful, scenery.  Ask him what he ate in Hawaii.  Yeah, what'd you eat?  Chicken.  No.  Where did you go?  Well, we went to Roy's.  That's a very good place in Hawaii.  Not even open, anyone?  Bubba's Burgers is a chain on Kauai. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, that sounds great.  I wouldn't expect you guys to know you haven't been to Kauai.  You're in Hawaii, and you go to Bubba's Burgers.  It's a Kauai chain.  A lot of celebrities.  He didn't try anything local.  I just named local places.  Wouldn't that drive you nuts, guy?  Well, you know what?  You got to go.  It's not just going to local.  You got to try what the locals are known for.  That's what I mean.  You know, if you're going to go, you got to have some poke.  You got to have some of the...  Oh, some of the...  I didn't get a chance to have any poke.  What's wrong with you?  I don't like poke.  Poke your eye out.  I don't know.  Jim's not here, so I did it.  Where'd he go?  I'm making him his special steak with no one. 
[03:01:00]  He doesn't really like you.  Is that another...  Really?  You got up on the wrong side today, didn't you?  It's not really.  It's all right.  You want to talk about what's driving you?  He's not really into you.  What's making you so mad today?  No, he had to do a phone call.  I can't do that.  He's doing a phoner?  He's promoting a gig in Minneapolis?  Yeah.  He loves you, guy.  He's a good man.  He's a good man.  People are already texting that they want me to take them to the restaurant.  There you go.  Why don't we have a little thing where you grab your... 
[03:01:30]  Let me figure out what I was going to say.  Why don't you grab five of your listeners that you really like and then text you all the time?  We hate our listeners.  Okay, well then don't bring any of them.  Bring someone from your home.  Yeah, yeah.  But why don't you bring them and we'll set you up at the restaurant.  Guy, people are saying that I'm a dick to you.  I'm not a dick to you.  Is that really?  I would say that.  You're not a beat.  I will say you, I think I picked...  I'm feeling the love in the room.  Huh?  You're not feeling...  You're not feeling the love?  Okay.  And one of your hardcore fans, they hope you stop being a dick to Guy.  I got to agree. 
[03:02:00]  Whoa.  There you go.  What?  There you go.  Well, listen.  Just trying to make some artificial attention here.  It wasn't the love we had last time, Harry.  I think you're coming in and cooking and everything, but I pissed off your intern and now you guys  are all mad at me.  Nah, Guy, you know what it is?  You know when you feel comfortable enough around your friends to finally go like, ah,  you're a dick.  No, that's exactly how it should be.  It's not like when you first meet, you shake hands and go, hey, asshole, how you doing?  Yeah, we're at that stage for you.  You know, you see your friend, you go, hey, asshole, how you doing?  Did I not promote...  I think we're at that point now, fuckwad.  And didn't...  Listen, you douchebags are my favorite.  I tell you.  Coming and hanging out.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Did you hear what Guy said on that show? 
[03:02:30]  I ate the whole thing.  Don't even...  Don't sweat it, man.  I'm laughing.  I promoted your restaurant totally.  I just made fun of the bobblehead cook from the Food Network.  I'm full.  If I had some bread, I would fucking soak that shit up.  Oh, yeah.  We're a little bummed about the bread thing.  That is fantastic.  Anybody?  Yeah, we did.  We blew it on the steak.  It was so good.  Amazing.  Do you believe in vegetables, by the way?  It's just about steak, I guess, huh?  No, no.  We do vegetables there, too.  We do roasted seasonal vegetables.  And we do sashimi.  We do...  Vast potatoes. 
[03:03:00]  I mean, there's a variety.  I want some of those.  I mean, there's a California style food.  What do you mean sashimi?  What are you doing?  We do...  It's called sashimi wantacos.  So we take the sushi-grade ahi, we chop it up, mix it with a mango and jicama slaw.  Keep talking.  And then we drop that into a little fried wonton taco shell.  Oh, wow.  And then we drop a little bit of a sweet soy on top of it.  Sam's drooling at this.  And a little wasabi cream sauce.  Sam's going to puke.  It's just his style.  That sounds delicious.  Do you style your gringo rolls?  Not in Guy's America, but in California.  He lost weight.  Stop.  In California, we do. 
[03:03:30]  Got it?  Gringo rolls.  Okay.  Where's the...  I got it.  I got it.  I know.  Thank you, Sam.  Nailed him.  I nailed him.  No one.  Who's steak is that?  Oh, that's Jimmy.  That's the no one.  That's for Jimmy.  Oh, great.  You give it to the fucking Hoover.  You're going to put it there.  He's going to get cold.  Wow.  His sauce is...  Can't we take it to him where he's doing his...  Whatever he's doing?  His phone-er.  His sauce is different.  Take it to him in the bathroom.  What have you...  I don't...  Yeah, take it to his phone-er.  You got some silverware?  Yeah, right here.  Seriously, Jimmy would like that. 
[03:04:00]  Bring it over.  So what does it take?  Bring it over.  Bring it over.  Here you go, brother.  It's defeating its own purpose.  Over here.  I don't know where he's at.  Iraq, did you try the steak?  No, I did not.  What's wrong with you?  Sick?  Oh, man.  You weren't offered any?  Jesus.  That's so rude.  Maybe he assumed you could live off your own weight for months.  Didn't I just make two extra steaks?  Yeah, right?  I ate them.  Look at Iraq.  Oh, boy.  Bring that over to Jim, boy. 
[03:04:30]  I'm just hoping he does something bad to it.  Oh, he's putting his finger in it.  Did he?  Did he pick off it when he walked out?  He tasted the sauce.  That's never making it to Jim, by the way.  It's definitely...  Hey, Guy Fieri made you a burrito.  Try this.  That was like one of those puzzles where you got the wolf, the chicken, and the feed,  and you got to bring it across the river one at a time.  It's like, okay, give the plate to Iraq, but leave the steak here.  Have him take it to Jimmy.  Jimmy comes back with the plate. 
[03:05:00]  He's eating that shit right now.  So what is it going to take?  Let's get through this because I think that there's been some communication breakdown.  Yeah, we got some problems here.  What does it take to get you to California?  Oh, man, a plane?  An invitation?  Do I have to kick down tickets?  Nah.  Private plane would be nice.  Private plane.  The Fieri...  Okay, I guess we're not going to be getting that together now, are we?  The Fieri G6 would be nice.  I would imagine you have the private plane from time to time.  Yeah.  The Fieri logo on the tail with fucking bitches in there.  Just flames on the side of the plane.  Oh, my God.  He's cooking steaks in the engines. 
[03:05:30]  Right.  Like, he had a custom-made...  The rock sign on the side of the plane.  That'd rule.  We're rocking.  Fucking just roll in the plane.  We let you guys fly in.  Oh, my God.  He's fucking...  You know what?  The pilots actually turn upside down, and Guy squeezes vodka into their mouth.  It is so wrong, but it's so right.  Totally.  The nose cone is bleached blonde.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man, right?  That'd rule.  What's that?  What happened, Iraq? 
[03:06:00]  Did you take the steak for a tour of the fucking building?  What are you doing?  What happened?  Hey, look, everybody.  I don't want it.  He doesn't want it.  Oh, man.  You can't say that on the air.  He didn't want it.  Why didn't he want it?  He went, I don't want it, and waved me off.  Oh, he's mad.  He's in the middle of a falling.  He might be cracking.  Great reporting all the details.  That was helpful.  Iraq, why don't you have a little, and tell us what you think.  He was having a Chipotle burrito.  Jimmy's in the middle of a fawner, and I think Iraq interrupted him.  Jesus, get a bigger piece. 
[03:06:30]  Holy fuck, Iraq just shoved a quarter of the steak in his mouth.  How is it, Iraq?  And that's a one-pounder.  And that's not the sauce we had, by the way.  He had to tame it down to get the red wine out of it.  That's everything but the red wine.  It's amazing, right?  Fantastic.  Hey, hey, hey, what's up?  Jimmy, why were you mad at Iraq?  Because Iraq basically came back and said you were annoyed.  No, I wasn't annoyed.  I had to do a fawner to promote an on sale.  No, no, I wanted Iraq to have it.  I was saying, here, you enjoy it.  Is this no alcohol?  No, that's no alcohol.  It's very good.  Yeah, that's why we brought it in, too, Jimmy.  Thank you, guys.  No, no, I knew I was coming right back in. 
[03:07:00]  I wanted to share with the staff.  We always get these nice things, but they don't.  Yeah.  Justifiably so.  We work hard.  Yeah.  They're valueless.  Guy played a little joke, though.  He put bourbon in it.  But I didn't know.  I didn't know.  He sprinkled it with fucking cocaine.  There's crystal meth in it.  Keep you coming back.  Yeah.  What the hell is that?  See that?  That's juju right there.  What is that?  What happened, Iraq?  Is your gravity pulling it in?  That's something I must tell. 
[03:07:30]  Okay, back to the California trip.  Santa Rosa.  So we get you to Santa Rosa.  I mean, you guys could stay at, put you up at the, out at the winery or something.  Oh, we can't stay at your house?  No, we'll get a little casita for you.  Hey, like, no, we'll go.  We got the ordinary for you guys.  Stay away.  Stay away from my wife.  Stay away from my wife and kids, please.  Imagine just walking down to the fridge with your underwear, scratching your balls,  looking what's inside.  Hey, what do you got?  Hey, what's Guy got in here?  You know what?  We were on the plane.  That means we're going to swim in the pond, not the pool.  Yeah, well, the pond would be better for you.  Only between 1 and 115. 
[03:08:00]  Okay, right.  Thank you.  Do you have a huge house out there?  No, I got the same house I've lived in for the last 20 years.  For real?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But you liked it, I guess.  Oh, I liked it.  I mean, I built a kitchen off the side of it.  Yeah, it's got some stuff done.  There's been a few things done.  A few adjustments have been made.  And here's the original part of the house, this bathroom.  Built around it.  But he wants everyone to know he's a regular guy.  You're a regular guy.  I thought we were going to glide right past that stuff.  No, really, I bought that house without my wife ever seeing. 
[03:08:30]  My wife was in Rhode Island visiting her family, and I found the house.  And I wanted the house that had a little bit of property to it.  And I wanted to be able to expand.  And I built my parents' house right next to my house.  And my wife was told about that.  Oh, really?  Anyhow, let's move on to another topic.  You guys are coming back out.  So we're coming out there.  That steak was phenomenal, man.  What do you think?  That was unbelievable.  And that's the whole idea about it, is you use great ingredients.  You cook it the right way.  You handle it the right way.  And this is something you don't find.  This is kind of an old-school dish.  But I'll tell you something. 
[03:09:00]  At Rock's House, that was some garlic, rosemary, mashed potatoes.  And you've got to see this stuff that we're doing.  I've got a burger.  I've got a burger that we're doing.  You just felt like not bringing all that stuff in here.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Gregorio.  Sam, I guess we'll just imagine the garlic, mashed potatoes, the French bread.  He gets Sam as an ally.  I have to.  An enemy of my enemy is my friend.  He really is telling us all this great stuff.  You know, normally when you eat this stuff, we get you blown in the restaurant.  So we're enjoying that. 
[03:09:30]  I don't want to use my imagination today.  Oh, this is great.  What wine would you recommend with that steak, by the way?  This right here, a little Cabernet Sauvignon.  I was going to go Cabernet.  Cabernet or Zin.  Something heavy.  You've got something rich.  This is Joel Gott Zin.  I've got to leave you some of this.  This guy, Joel Gott, makes the bomb.  What about a Shiraz?  Shiraz would be nice.  Would that be nice?  You just don't want to go too light.  You've got to think about what you're cooking with and what type of, you know, this has  got demi-glace in it, so it's a little bit on the richer side.  What's demi-glace?  That's demi-more. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, you're fucking getting us out of here.  Jesus.  What is demi-glace?  Demi-glace is a reduction.  It starts with veal stock, with veal bones, and it's a traditional sauce made with tomatoes,  and it cooks down, and it becomes really rich.  It's kind of like, it's for the average, it's like beef broth on steroids.  Oh, oh.  Nice.  Yeah, you add demi-glace.  It's almost, it's not a gravy, but it starts with veal stock and works its way down through  the...  Stock.  You know, you said you're going to leave some of the wine?  Yeah.  You mean the bottle that's half empty? 
[03:10:30]  No.  Oh, man.  What the hell are you fucking...  Listen, you want me to put a feeder nipple on it?  Is that why we're into this now?  Look at that thing.  You want one of those, too?  That's nice.  I want to try the Zinfandel.  We got some, we got some wine now?  Do we have some cups, guys?  No, I'm good.  Oh, it's Friday.  Oh, it's Friday.  I offer?  Come on, bro.  I'll take a little bit of that red right there.  Of course you will.  Why wouldn't you?  Why wouldn't you?  After all, it is 9.30.  Yeah, you know, why not have a paper cup full of wine before you've got to do 70 down the 
[03:11:00]  LIE?  No reason not to enjoy an iced glass.  All right.  I do have my issues.  I will try it.  I will try it.  Oh, Jim, you want to pull up a computer and jerk off for 10 hours while I drink this?  You bet I do.  Oh, that's good.  How about it?  Good point.  Welcome to Cross to Bear.  Yeah.  Ant makes a valid point.  Here I am being all high and mighty, but yet by the time this stuff's all washed and put  away, I'll be tugging my penis at home, wondering why I can't get a show on the air. 
[03:11:30]  Tugging?  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That's very good, guy.  Not bad, huh?  Not a bad wine.  Oh, this guy.  You make your own wine?  Not yet.  Not yet.  Clear the field.  I'm just getting into it.  It's going to be a...  Some men are going to do some drinking.  Well, that seems to be a thing a lot of celebrities do.  They're getting their own wine out there.  Well, there's different ways to do it.  Some people just slap a name on it.  Well, yeah, yeah.  Some people really get into it.  We just got a little vineyard with some fantastic pinot, so in the town that we live in, Santa  Rosa, Sonoma County.  And the pinot is the bomb. 
[03:12:00]  It's actually the...  We sell it right now to William Selyum, which is kind of like the gods of pinot in California.  Actually, in the world.  They're one of the best pinots in the world.  And La Crema is another winery that we sell to.  But we'll get into it pretty soon.  I got a couple other projects going on, this little restaurant thing, you know.  Yeah, you're probably pretty tied up.  Kind of looming over my head a little bit.  But don't let those...  Are you a millionaire?  Oh, man.  No, by any chance.  A little kid walked up to me and then he goes, are you rich?  Look at this little kid. 
[03:12:30]  I'm like...  See where the questions come from.  And I go...  Yeah, sure.  And I go, I am.  You're right.  I'm rich in friends.  And his mom looks at me and goes, nice.  I'm rich in candy.  Oh, Jesus.  Who gets that room in the van?  More steak coming out.  Who gets it?  Wow.  Well, who hasn't had any yet?  I mean, how about Kenny?  Kenny never allows himself a treat.  No, no.  He won't.  He's on the job.  He will not do it.  It's part of the job.  We want Kenny to offer an opinion.  Kenny likes a good steak.  Mm-hmm.  Where's Kenny?  You never know when he's happy, so this could backfire for guys.  No, it's good. 
[03:13:00]  Kenny loves a good steak.  Not quite up to Uncle Vito's wine that he brought in that day.  That's got to be for...  Where's Troy?  Do you want some?  Was it a Vito?  Who was it?  Oh, Troy had some?  Uncle Nino's wine.  It's homemade wine?  Yeah, take that to the group that we just talked to.  Hey, take that to morning mash-up.  They were the ones that were real nice.  Morning mash-up?  Whoa!  Wow.  You take that to the mash-up.  Let them split it.  I'm sure they will.  They'll all dig in and feed each other.  Oh, they do it.  They're all so united.  They're like superheroes.  I'm sure you enjoyed your three-minute interview in between 20 fucking pop songs. 
[03:13:30]  How's the wine?  It's really good.  Fantastic.  Do you get enough?  Do you want another steak?  Have you processed that one yet?  Come on.  You can make one a go.  Make one to go?  Did that mean make one and go?  I got a pregnant wife at home.  Make one and go.  Let's go.  That's a good call.  What does that mean?  Huh?  Sam?  Oh, see, and he's not using alcohol for the pregnant wife.  Yeah, no.  Is there alcohol in there?  No, no.  He's got the water in there.  In that capacity, I mean, I'm not going to-  How am I going to bring it home, though?  Any way to bring a steak?  But that doesn't do anything. 
[03:14:00]  Put it in your pocket.  I don't think even guzzling down fucking scotch if a woman's pregnant does anything, right?  Old school.  Ask my mom.  Yeah, the smoking Paul Malls with two martinis.  They used to smoke in the delivery room, guy.  Yeah.  Is that amazing, though?  I mean, it's like I was-  My kids and I were talking to my dad, and my kid says, Hunter, he says,  I heard you didn't wear a seatbelt when you were a kid.  I said, what?  I'd ride in the back of the pickup truck.  There was no seatbelts available.  Good ass, though.  The back of the truck with the dog and shit.  No car seats for kids. 
[03:14:30]  No such stuff.  And how about there weren't fucking seatbelts in some of the cars I had growing up with?  My father had some old cars.  And then the back seat didn't have seatbelts for quite a while.  And look at all the wheelchairs you see today.  It was probably a bad move.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  No airbags.  Nothing.  One of the great places as a kid to go is the back window.  It had that little shelf.  And you'd lay down up there knowing that you'd become a deadly projectile if your old dad  spilt his beer in his lap and hit something.  The cap.  Oh, the Cuban looks. 
[03:15:00]  The cab over camper.  The cab over camper, man.  Yes, yes.  We just cruising along, staring out at that.  Have you ever hit anything?  You look out the window.  It felt like you were in a B-17 in the bomber window in the front.  It was fantastic.  That was the bomb.  Is that when you have a pickup truck with the little thing that goes over it?  Cab over camper, yeah.  Okay.  You have that on the back.  But doesn't that raise up, though?  It always looks so claustrophobic.  It is.  It's pretty.  No, it's not the little squatty one like that.  Yeah, no.  You're jacked up.  No, this is the big one.  You can sleep in there.  There's a bed in there.  Yeah.  You used to do that all the time.  Where'd you grow up?  Was it California? 
[03:15:30]  Jersey.  Northern California.  Northern California.  I was in Southern California in my formative teen years.  And, yeah, I did all that shit.  Backup pickup trucks all the time.  That's how you drove around as a kid.  You never got to sit in the pickup truck.  Remember that Subaru used to make a little called Subaru Brat that used to have the seats  in the back with the little handles?  With the fucking death handles on them.  Hold on to those when you go into a head-on.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, crazy.  And my father had horses and stuff, so there was a lot of hay deliveries being made with  the truck.  So you'd get in the back after the hay was unloaded, and you're in a hurricane of 
[03:16:00]  fucking hay in your eyes, ears, everywhere.  Terrible.  I lived the same magical childhood.  My magical childhood, yeah.  Go raise this sheep, and then we're going to take it and slaughter it out in the yard.  Come watch.  Yeah, go ahead.  Did you ever butcher animals?  I saw many an animal buy it.  You will let me know if Concho Pete stops screaming, won't you?  We had a big pig roast once at one of the ranches, and one guy held the back. 
[03:16:30]  Back legs.  Another guy held the front legs of this pig, and my dad just blasted him in the head  with a .357 magnum.  That's a quick way to do it, though.  It was amazing.  And then they just, you know, throat, hoist him up by the hind legs.  Where did you live, though?  Because you say Southern California.  People think you're in, like, a-  It was Compton.  I'm in Venice.  Yeah, we're at Venice Beach butchering the pig.  No, it was actually San Juan Capistrano in Orange County.  Ooh, where the salmon spawn.  And the swallows come back.  Oh, you never told me about the salmon.  Dumb and Dumber?  They had salmon down there? 
[03:17:00]  No?  No, no.  That was a Dumb and Dumber.  It was, yeah.  Hey, I just checked my Twitter.  You went to Nick Tahoe's in Rochester?  Yeah.  I used to eat the garbage plates up there.  I've never heard a bonding experience not work as badly as that one did.  Did you have a good?  No.  I'm going to try that.  Do you remember being there?  There was one?  That's hilarious.  The garbage plate.  Jimmy's right. 
[03:17:30]  No, but it was-  I get excited when Rochester info comes in.  No, my Uncle Pete lives in-  That failed miserably.  My Uncle Pete lives in Rochester, and that's enough of an experience.  My Uncle Pete was my-  He's like the leader of the family.  Heating up.  And he's-  Okay, I'll move past that story then.  Let's move on to something else.  No, go ahead.  No, Uncle Pete lives in Rochester with my Aunt Jerry and a bunch of my cousins, and I was  not always Uncle Pete's favorite.  I was a little bit rambunctious in my college years. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, so Uncle Pete, actually, we were leaving, and finally I had left.  We were there for a big wedding, and I just happened to sneak back into Uncle Pete's  house.  A little terrorized.  Anyhow.  Oh, you kind of paid Uncle Pete back.  Yeah, there you go.  Give Uncle Pete a little.  All right.  So making some more steaks.  Is this with wine or without wine?  If I'm bringing it home, no.  No wine.  No vino?  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah.  How am I bringing this home, though?  No, I make it for somebody else.  Fuck it.  No, you can't.  I mean, did you tell your wife that I was on the show, we were going to make this, and 
[03:18:30]  didn't take it home?  Okay.  I mean, I'll wrap it in a sock.  Fair enough.  Wonderful.  You got something to bring it home, man?  No, you didn't.  We'll find something.  Oh, man.  I'll just put it in a bag.  Steak in the bag.  Roland will bring it home in a package he calls a small colon.  So we're going to stay in a vineyard and not his house?  Why wouldn't we?  And what are we going to do?  Much better.  You guys want to stay in my house.  That really...  Are you going to be there when we're there?  No.  What was that?  That's ridiculous. 
[03:19:00]  No, of course I'm going to be there.  We're going to have a great time.  We're going to cook.  We're going to eat.  We're going to sign a nondisclosure agreement.  Of course.  Okay?  We're going to do all the necessary.  Reed's standing over here going, no, do not invite.  You got guns?  Huh?  Yeah, guns.  Lots of guns.  Oh, nice.  That's awesome.  I like shooting guns.  In the backyard, especially.  Oh, yeah.  I thought maybe we'd knock over a bank or something.  Are you going to have another bonding experience gone bad?  Are you going to blindfold us from the airport so we don't know where you live?  It might be part of that. 
[03:19:30]  Take your cell phones and gag and ball.  The whole deal.  There's a dominatrix in Tucson who does that.  Of course, you know.  I hear she meets you at a Burger King and blindfolds you and then brings you to her house.  You'll hear that.  I've never...  No, I would love to see her, but I have not.  Really?  Yep.  Her, by the way.  That's funny.  It was her.  Yo, guy, look up.  Oh, there you go.  No, look up.  I am looking up.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll Instagram.  See now?  So, Instagram, Twitter.  How is Instagram?  What are you on Twitter again?  Guy Fieri?  Guy Fieri, yeah.  When is this happening now? 
[03:20:00]  When is this trip to California happening?  I would like to do this.  Well, as soon as we sign a contract or not.  Oh, yeah.  And then...  You guys are probably going to work me for some advertisers.  Re-up on...  No, what are you kidding?  No, man.  Not with you, with the company.  We're not even going to go on the air with this.  No, we...  We're just going out there to hang out.  No, that's what I meant.  And then we'll come back with some stories.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Our contract to continue working here is up in October, next month.  That's right.  Really?  So, once we get...  And this is how you guys are working for ratings?  This is bringing me on and this is it. 
[03:20:30]  Letting your intern yell at me, that's awesome.  You're a big celebrity.  Yeah, and Sam Roberts is always radio gold.  I was just thinking that myself, boy.  Yeah, I feel like you're a big celebrity guy.  No, no, no.  How long has Steve Blatter...  Steve Blatter looks like an emo girl with that hairdo.  He just walked by.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, he's terrible.  I missed that.  An emo girl.  He looks like an emo girl without her makeup.  I didn't see him there.  Yeah.  You get recognized a lot, though, don't you, Guy?  Yeah, a couple times.  You've got a very unique look and you're on a lot of television shows. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, no, it's...  You've got a lot of fans in Times Square.  You'll walk up through there.  Oh, my God.  It's Guy Fier.  Get a picture for the love of God.  I'll tell you the best one.  So, I'm in some diner, some southern state.  I'm sitting there having a meeting with my team and we're talking about the show coming up  and the whole thing we're going to do and I can hear these two ladies arguing.  They know it's me, but they sit there and they're arguing.  They're arguing about who's my biggest fan and who knows most about me.  Back and forth, back and forth.  And the one that's kind of a little bit more... 
[03:21:30]  They're about six years old.  The one that's a little bit more aggressive than the other finally stands up.  I'm sitting right here, right next to them.  And they've never looked at me, but they're referencing me the whole time.  She goes, I am his biggest fan.  I know everything about him.  I know his book.  I don't know where the accent came from.  I know his books.  I know his restaurants and his wife and the whole thing.  I am Gus Ferrari's best friend.  Gus Ferrari.  Oh, yeah.  But I am Gus Ferrari.  I am.  When you guys come out to California, I'm going to go in the alias of Gus Ferrari. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  So, you go to California.  Yeah.  I guess we should go, right?  California?  Why not?  That'd be nice.  You want to bring the wives?  Girlfriends?  Wives?  Both?  I don't know.  I'll have two kids.  What's the age of consent in California?  Yeah, exactly.  I have to put you on those things.  Don't you know that?  Until October 10th.  It's on your app, isn't it?  It's on your app.  We joke.  Really?  Do you think you're a terrible person?  Yes.  I am a pile of shit.  But, you know.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:22:30]  I'm enjoying myself.  That's a good boy.  What do you guys want to do when you come to California?  You said shoot guns, rob banks, and...  Yeah, shoot some guns.  Terrorize my house.  I like going to the...  You know what?  I like a good wine vineyard.  I better been to one.  I want to go to a place where they make honey.  I enjoy some good raw honey.  You want to go to a beehive?  That's awesome.  No, but I want to go to a honey maker.  Wear this.  Like Apocalypto.  But I do.  I've been eating a little bit of raw honey lately.  I think that's good for you, right?  Raw honey's really good for you. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, with the little crusty stuff on top.  And we have honey out there.  We've got a lot of honey farms out there.  I figured.  Yeah, I'd like to go there.  We've got...  I mean, the artisan food program that's going on in this area that I live in, Northern California  is the bomb.  I mean, we've got great Tamales Bay.  We've got great oysters.  We've got great crab coming out of Bodega Bay.  We've got ranches.  We've got a lot of organics.  I mean, it'd be a good time.  I don't know.  Then we should also talk about that.  If that's what you want to find, we're definitely not going to get that in January and February.  Would you guys tell me when you guys want to make it happen?  Does it get cold up there? 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, it's north of San Francisco, right?  Not too bad.  I mean, I don't think we drop really below 50 degrees.  We don't get snow.  So we live in that kind of environment.  We get fog.  We get fog.  We get some rain.  I like a good fog.  You know, I came up with this quote.  The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.  Boy, somebody has been ripping that off from me just so.  I know they have.  That's been getting used somewhere.  Mike Twain guy.  Remember that from Escape from Alcatraz?  Doc said that before he chopped his fingers off. 
[03:24:00]  Mark Twain once wrote.  He chopped his fingers off.  Yeah, Mr. Zimmerman.  Have you ever been to Alcatraz?  Yes.  It's one of my favorite places.  I wanted to sit on the same step as English did.  You don't get to go.  They don't take you with a guide anymore.  At least the last time I went to.  They gave you a headset.  I got mine in Chinese.  I didn't understand.  I'd been there before at least, but thank you.  Anyway, is this thing on?  But they used to take you with a guide, and then they would put you in solitary confinement.  Oh, yeah.  So, like, one minute in there, I was crazy.  That's fun.  It was an awesome place.  I love the fact that people were horrified there and terrorized. 
[03:24:30]  And now it's just...  This is fun.  Let's take lunch.  Let's have lunch in the yard.  I've never been there.  I've never even been to, like, Northern California.  And you grew up in Cali?  Yeah.  Never decided...  You've been to Humboldt, though.  I've been to fucking...  It's just like L.A.  That's as far north as I ever went.  Wow.  I went west.  I went, like, in Mojave Desert and shit like that, out shooting and stuff like that.  Peyote.  Yeah, yeah, shit like that.  You never went to San Francisco?  Never went up to Frisco. 
[03:25:00]  It's a great city.  It's an awesome, awesome city.  Great food.  A lot going on.  I mean, there's just a lot of pieces going on.  And it's a big, small city.  So you can get from one end of San Francisco and the other in 25 minutes.  You go to the Tenderloin District.  It's potluck prostitutes.  You don't know what you got until you lift up the dress.  Tenderloin District.  That's what they call it.  Reed, you can use that value.  I love that.  The Tenderloin District.  Yeah, it's great.  I love San Francisco.  It's phenomenal, man.  That's a great city.  Sounds fun.  Great comedy city.  There's a lot of good food there.  There's a lot to see. 
[03:25:30]  And it's a really interesting geographically set up city because of the mountains and the hills and the this and that and the cable cars and all that kind of stuff.  I know.  I used to watch Streets of San Francisco.  Isn't that awesome with Carl Molden?  Oh, yeah.  I never seen Carl Molden.  And young Michael Douglas.  That was awesome.  I like when they gave the episode name.  Yes.  Killer in pantyhose.  It's always something like that.  Murder for a wallet.  That's how vague they were.  I was watching Canon recently.  It's all those dumb old Quinn Martin shows. 
[03:26:00]  How about McCloud?  McCloud.  When he would ride the horse down the street.  Was it New York City?  In the city.  Yeah.  It was in New York City.  But he had the cowboy hat and the horse.  Yeah, in New York City.  In New York City.  What was the other?  Is there any other?  Mannix.  Mannix was an older one.  He was a detective.  But, yeah.  What was Robert Reed's one with his?  What was the one he did?  What was his show?  Robert Reed.  Didn't he do a show?  A cop show?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  I thought he did it.  So, I got the.  Oh, McMillan and wife.  No, that's. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, Rock Hudson.  I'm sorry.  Rock Hudson.  The other guy that had a problem.  Okay.  The other guy that might have caught a cold.  Rock Hudson.  Sorry.  McMillan and wife.  McMillan and wife.  So, I got Starsky and Hutch.  I got all the Starsky and Hutch's for a Christmas DVD box set.  So, I'm all excited.  I put it in the thing.  We're sitting there for New Year's and I'm watching it.  God, it wasn't nearly as good as I remember it.  Yeah.  That was all those shows.  Huggy Bear wasn't as good.  I mean, the whole thing.  I'm like, what happened?  It's cheesy, right?  I thought this was cool at the time. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, it was the bomb.  I mean, you would wait.  Yeah.  And same thing with Six Million Dollar Man.  Do you ever watch the beginning?  Do you remember the beginning, beginning, beginning of Six Million Dollar Man?  No.  It never made the da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  First, like, two, three, four episodes, he doesn't make the da-na-na-na when he jumps.  No.  It's the sound of him bending metal.  Is that da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then, somehow, that turned into him jumping.  That became the metal.  I'm totally pissed.  I made it-  I played-  You guys are fucking around with the sound.  I pulled the CDs back and forth, played it, and I was making my kid, listen, Hunter,  Tell me if this, and he goes, what is wrong with you, Ed? 
[03:27:30]  Who cares?  This is horrible.  No, this was my childhood.  This was a lunchbox I had.  We had Lee Majors on.  Did you?  Yeah.  Cool guy?  Yeah, he was very nice.  He was the bomb, though, man.  Come on.  Lee Majors and Jamie.  Jamie.  Jamie Wagner.  Jamie Wagner.  Wagner, right.  And then he had that.  Did you have the.  It was Lindsay Wagner.  She was Jamie something in the show.  Jamie Summers.  Jamie Summers, yes.  Lindsay Wagner?  We just called her Jamie Wagner.  Yeah, we threw it all into one forgettable glop of shit. 
[03:28:00]  It was Jamie Farr.  Jamie Farr.  Yeah, but then I came up with the real one, so I'm good.  But I will tell you this, though.  If you watch Old MASH, though.  If you watch Old MASH, that's not.  Doesn't hold up, right?  The humor doesn't.  I think the drama does.  I don't think the humor does, but I think the drama holds up.  Really?  Come on.  Yeah.  B.J. Honeycutt.  Who gets 70, man?  B.J.  B.J. and the Bear.  He was just not a funny guy.  No, but I think that the drama holds.  Like, when they have dramatic moments, you know, I've done your job, Captain.  I'll do mine.  Make-O in 2012. 
[03:28:30]  I think that holds up, but I don't think a lot of the humor does.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Oh, horse hockey.  Canned laughter.  Horse hockey.  What about when, was it not Frank Burns?  It was Captain.  What was the Captain that dies?  The other one.  Wayne, Captain Henry Blake.  Henry Blake.  Oh, yeah.  The Sea of Japan, yeah.  Remember that?  When he dies and the whole thing.  Tell me he didn't shed a tear.  You're so crowded because they didn't tell the cast they were doing that.  The first time they heard it was when Gary Berghoff actually read the paper, and that's 
[03:29:00]  why somebody dropped something.  One of them actually dropped something, and they just left that take, but none of them  knew he was being killed off.  They thought he was going to be able to return and do, you know, oh, by a mishap, here's  Henry Blake.  That was crazy.  Yeah.  He's got a layover.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly, but they said, no, this is how it feels to be in war, and this is what we're  doing.  Like those shows where they just write him off, but they keep his character on the phone.  Hey, hey, it's Henry Blake's on the phone.  He's visiting his aunt in Wisconsin.  Oh, hi, Henry.  That was terrible.  He wrote a letter. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, here's a letter.  I just saw Born Legacy the other night, and they kept bringing up Matt Damon, or whatever  his character's name is, and I keep thinking, okay, he's going to come in, and now he's  going to start kicking some ass.  No, he doesn't show in that one.  They just teased you.  There was more than one.  Yeah, well, that's the whole key.  Spoiler.  Spoiler.  Spoiler alert.  All right, let's get Guy out of here.  He was supposed to leave at 9.30.  No, that's what we were.  Why?  Because we're out of wine now?  Oh, man.  Oh, I met that dude in the elevator. 
[03:30:00]  Ira Roll.  He was awesome.  He told me to tell you it's going to snow.  11 inches.  Get your squeeze out.  Get your squeeze.  That's what he told me.  He told me to tell you that in the elevator.  Ira.  Come in and say hi, Ira.  Look at him.  He's just walking away.  He had a variety of topics to tell me.  Oh, Ira is the best.  Maybe he needs to say.  Hello.  No, I guess that fell, too.  Oh, look at him.  Look, he doesn't even want to look at us.  Does he know?  He was holding court in the lobby.  Well, he probably got in trouble for the last time he was on our show.  Oh, maybe he did.  He's not allowed to be on our show.  But he continues to go on our show. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  Guys, so you guys want to...  The steak was fantastic.  It's called what?  Steak Diane?  Steak Diane.  Here's the deal.  I'm going to be down at the restaurant for the next three or four days doing the training  with the staff.  If you guys want to come down, serious, legit offer.  Just come on down.  And tonight we're all tight.  But Saturday and Sunday we'll be down there.  Come down anytime during the day.  And we'll hook you up with some brews.  Make you some food.  So you can watch some of the training.  I just want to check out the place.  It sounds awesome.  Whenever you're ready, man.  Ready to have you anytime.  Where's it going to be, 44th between 7th and 8th?  It's called Guy's American Kitchen and Bar.  You can't miss it. 
[03:31:00]  There's about 9,000 signs in front of the joint.  Right on.  I'm excited for you.  Yeah, thanks, man.  I know we beat the shit out of you, but we're excited.  This is what I would expect.  And I appreciate it.  Because now I did get to move past the, hey, here's our guest and let's all be nice.  I appreciate a little smackdown.  Do you guys make a...  I want to have a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper.  And I'm going to hurry.  I want a hush puppy, daddy.  You have to bank rob a bank robin.  It's baby shit.  No matter what this guy's doing.  Shut your ass.  That could be the funniest performance ever in a movie. 
[03:31:30]  In the back, Junior.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You seem much taller on the radio.  Nobody makes a possum's pecker out of Buford tea.  And he goes, except for that, shut your ass.  Junior has an example.  Take it easy on the car wash, boys.  We quote it all the time.  He's pounding down, loaded up in trucking.  Hilarious, man.  That's good stuff.  All right.  So we have to plug...  Shamelessly.  Yes, absolutely.  A guy has dinners, drive-ins, and dives.  Season 15. 
[03:32:00]  Wow.  It's 10 o'clock on the...  Yeah, the great Gus Ferrari.  The 10 o'clock on the Food Network.  Monday the 24th is the Italian Extravaganza.  Guy checks out Italian food in Boston and Providence, where you'll see the Mayor Menino  stuff.  That's what I call it when I unzip my fly.  The Italian Extravaganza.  It says Italian foot in Boston, in Providence.  Oh, he checks out Italian foot, but that's also what Anthony calls it.  The Italian foot.  It was a lawnmower accident.  Yes, but he calls it that because it's got a nail on it, and it smells... 
[03:32:30]  All right, boo, I should have just quit while I was ahead.  It's got a nail on it.  That's pretty good.  Guy's American Kitchen and Bar here in New York.  220 West 44th Street.  That's the corner of 44th and between 7th and 8th, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Open Sunday.  Wow.  We'll definitely be down.  Monday now.  Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday.  Yeah, because I took the day off to come do this.  You are?  Oh, great.  And Guy Fieri on Twitter there.  Yeah.  And that's it.  You guys are great, man.  Thanks for having me.  I'm glad now that I'm in part of the connection where I can get insulted on the show. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, you're in there.  Oh, good.  It was a lot better.  Hold on.  We have a special guest.  Oh, boy.  Look who's here.  It's over.  Just come here.  Do you know Guy Fieri?  Ira?  He's a big star.  Good morning, everybody.  Hi.  Hey, good morning, Ira.  You know Guy?  Yes, I went into the elevator with him.  Oh.  And you talked about radio with him?  For the weather.  Well, he does radio, too.  Yes, I did.  I talked about the weather.  What did I tell him?  I asked him what I told him.  It's going to snow. 
[03:33:30]  What?  It's in your studio.  That's crazy.  Yes.  14 inches.  Oh, it went up three.  Went up 14.  That's right.  Get your skis.  That's our studio.  What about outside?  Let the people know what the weather's going to be.  It's nice, sunny, 87 degrees today.  And what about the outlook for the weekend?  Oh, that's a good question.  Out for the weekend.  Good question.  It's going to be partly cloudy tomorrow, high around 85 degrees. 
[03:34:00]  I like that.  With a chance of rain later in the day.  In the day.  And Sunday, 70 degrees, 75 degrees.  It's a big difference, five degrees.  That's right.  He likes hookers.  All right, Ira.  Ira likes hookers.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I had heard about this in the elevator.  Oh, he told me about that.  That's right.  No.  He goes back.  He loves talking about 250 bucks.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:34:30]  What do you got planned for the weekend, Ira?  Well, I'm going to Yonkers Racetrack.  All right.  You got to bet on the trotters.  No.  What?  I play the machine.  Oh.  The iron lung?  Yeah, what machine do you play?  Oh, boy.  What machine do you play?  I play any type of penny machine.  Penny machines.  You ever win?  Yes.  How much?  What's the most you ever win?  I can't mention that over the air.  God forbid if I mentioned that over the air, they would come after me. 
[03:35:00]  Who?  I don't say nothing whatsoever.  Who's coming after you?  Oh.  Oh, the mob.  The Ira S.  How much you make.  Right.  So you've made a lot on the penny slots?  Yes, I do.  You don't want to talk about it?  No, I don't.  All right.  Is it more than $1,000 in one sitting?  Sometimes I bring home extra. 
[03:35:30]  We love you, Ira.  That's epic.  Do you like when the money comes out,  or do you get the tokens?  I get the cash coupon.  I like hearing the money.  Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.  No, no.  It doesn't happen that way anymore.  Oh, man.  They took the fun out of it.  With the bucket?  They give cash coupons.  Cash coupon.  And then what? 
[03:36:00]  You go to the cage and cash it in?  That's right.  All right.  And we make a lot of money.  I make a lot.  Do they get free drinks at the casinos?  When I see $25 on it, take it out.  Oh.  Quick.  Immediately.  So $25 at a time, and then that's when you cash out.  That's right.  I'm getting...  Even if it's $20.  Yeah?  I'm getting a text.  Last time you won $13.  That's right.  How do you know?  How do you know? 
[03:36:30]  Somebody texted you?  Insider at the casino?  The IRS just texted me.  Yes.  The IRS just texted me.  Club Soda Kenny.  I guess you told Kenny.  $13.  I don't want to be in Paris.  No, I do not.  Club Soda Kenny's ratting.  Kenny said you won $13.  That's right.  A lot of pennies.  Do you make any loans?  No.  Literally.  No.  That's pretty good.  Only pennies?  Do you ever go up to a nickel?  No, I don't.  Why not?  Only penny machines in Yonkers, 25-cent machines in Atlantic City. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, you go up there for the Atlantic City.  That's right.  How much does...  You must get a lot of money to bring up there to start your bankroll when you go down to AC.  How much do you start with?  I don't want to say.  You can say how much you go there with, whether you win or not.  What do you like going down there for a bankroll when you're going to play the 25-cent slots?  About.  Ballpark.  Brown.  5-500. 
[03:37:30]  Damn.  500.  That's right.  Woo.  High roller.  Ira's in the high roller section.  That's a lot of pennies.  You couldn't even carry that many pennies.  A lot of pennies.  No quarters.  I bring home money.  Whoa.  That's right.  You always win?  Oh, yes.  You've never gone home a loser.  Yes.  And what about Yonkers?  Yonkers, I hit two.  Wow.  What's your system?  I have a system over there. 
[03:38:00]  What's your system?  Tell us.  I pull out all the tickets.  Yeah.  That's right.  Why is that a system?  I put in $20 and if it's $24 or $23, take it out.  Oh, I see.  Put it in my pocket.  So, you put in a $20 bill into the machine, right?  Yes.  And then you play, you play, you play, you play.  And it's chalking up.  Gee, gee, gee.  And then you get to $22. 
[03:38:30]  You're like, that's it.  I take it out.  I made two bucks profit.  That's right.  In the pocket.  You start with a brand new 20?  That's right.  That's a system.  Is that a system?  What if you lose the 20?  Ooh.  Yeah, I haven't lost a 20, and then I get $24, $25, take it out.  I'm sorry, Mr. Rothstein.  He just keeps winning on this machine.  Didn't you see that pay off a nickel?  Didn't you see that on three machines? 
[03:39:00]  You're invited to Yonkers.  Oh.  Yes.  Come over there.  You'll enjoy it.  They had a beautiful show led two weeks ago.  Yes.  What was the show?  By the racetrack.  What was the show?  Sarah Evans.  Ugh.  Sounds awful.  Who is she?  Sarah Evans at Yonkers Race.  That's right.  Who's Sarah Evans?  It's terrible.  Who's Sarah Evans?  What is she doing?  Sarah Evans, country music.  Oh.  Yes.  I hear she puts the, yeah, the country music. 
[03:39:30]  And in fact.  I got it.  I got it.  In July, they had the drifters, the coasters, and the platters.  Whoa.  That's old school.  That's right.  That's right.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-a-bang-a-bang-a-bang-a-bang-a-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang.  I'm in paradise.  I'm tripping out.  Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching.  What the hell's going on here?  What is just happening?  The drift is a-playing.  I'm dumping pennies in the machines. 
[03:40:00]  I'm in paradise.  Well, anybody that had Empire Card.  Oh, an Empire Card, yeah.  Yes.  They were allowed in.  Oh, they comp you like.  Wow.  No, they don't.  They don't take anything off your card.  No?  Then why have an Empire Card?  It's complimentary.  Oh.  Yes.  Oh, that's what I said.  They comped you.  Yeah.  It's comp.  Oh, that's pretty good.  What other benefits have you gotten from gambling so much there on your card? 
[03:40:30]  I get a lot of benefits in Atlantic City.  At least I see the shows over there also.  For free?  Yes.  What other ones have you seen besides the Sarah Evans?  I saw Andrew Dice Clay.  Neil Sedaka.  Oh.  Yes.  Neil Sedaka.  Yes.  Oh, that breaking up is hard to do.  In Bally's.  At Bally's.  That's right.  Did he do Bad Blood?  Oh, God.  Remember that?  Did he do Bad Blood?  Bad. 
[03:41:00]  Bad.  Well, I want to thank you for leaving me on your show.  Wait, did I lose you on that question?  Sorry.  TGIF.  Thank goodness it's Friday.  TGIF.  Thank you.  Thank God, Ira's fat.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Ira.  He didn't want to deal with Jim Norris.  I love Ira.  He didn't want to deal with my question about Neil Sedaka.  There's something going on there.  Thank you, Ira.  Look at his William Frawley pants.  Yeah.  That's great.  Hey, Rick.  That was awesome.  Isn't he great?  Yeah.  That was awesome.  I was riding in the elevator, and then I heard he came on your show, and I'm like, I got to see. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, he's the best.  That was wonderful.  We rarely get him.  It's got to be timed out perfectly.  He's got to be leaving.  Probably drug him in here with the wafting of the fantastic steak.  Yes, I'm sure.  Wonderful steak.  Hey, can I throw one shameless plug out?  Please.  I've got my foundation.  We're doing a big fundraiser for my foundation, CWK, Cooking with Kids, and we're doing it in the wine country next weekend, next Friday, actually, the 14th.  Mario Batali's coming out.  We're doing it in Kendall Jackson Vineyard.  It's called Chef Tables in the Vineyard, and we've got 30 chefs from the wine country, Batali, myself, and we're doing it to raise money for my foundation. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, that's cool, man.  It's all about getting kids involved in food and getting kids eating the right way, and we've got kids with diabetes and childhood obesity and all this stuff going on.  Oh, man, it's crazy, right?  So we're trying to raise awareness, raise money, and if you can just, you know, we can hook it up.  That's nice.  Very cool.  Childhood weight problem right there.  Our young E-Rock.  Look at him.  You see that?  He's only 12 years old.  It's really taking its toll. 
[03:42:30]  Yes.  That's not essentially how those are cookie crumbs.  You guys are great.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks, Guy.  I think that's the best one.  Absolutely.  How about you do it during the after show?  You guys, they pay for it.  Oh, God.  Now it's going to sound like I'm not sincere.  We should take a breath, and then-  It'll be fine.  Just do it.  Plow through it like you always do.  I don't mean that in a bad way.  I mean that-  How's value-  No.  Oh, I thought it was the other one.  No, no.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Fine then.  No, I thought it was the other one.  No, value for your money. 
[03:43:00]  Most companies, they don't seem to know what that even means, but there's a television provider  called Dish, and they do.  Love Dish.  You get more for your money, and that's value.  They have packages with more channels you want to watch, more of the most innovative features  in TV, and best of all, they give you it at a great price.  Dish.  Dish, cool new DVR.

You're going to find something that fits your lifestyle, and at the right price.  Stop paying more for TV and call Dish, 1-888-770-DISH.  That number again, 1-888-770-3474.  Dish, let's watch TV.

And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, indeed.  It was a little behind on breaks.  Had to catch up.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[03:47:30]  866-969-1969.  And I swear to God, if any of you call up here and say,  today I learned that Sam Roberts is an intern, I will not be happy.  That's the last thing you want to do, is see me unhappy.  Guy Fieri was in here today, cooking up some steaks and stuff.  I didn't even realize it, because we did it in the fishbowl.  And the fishbowl is this, you know, kind of contained glass room that's there in the lobby of the building.  And we did it there so we could have some space, you know?  He's got to set up his hot plates and everything. 
[03:48:00]  I didn't realize, like, I guess Sal told me when I got out,  all of us who were in there now reek of, like, steak and smoke.  Because it was basically just a hot box full of, uh, it's like being in a kitchen.  I had no idea.  Who's on the phones?  What is this, playtime for everybody back there?  There it goes.  There we go.  It's just me back here.  Where's the interns?  He's helping clean up the fishbowls, though. 
[03:48:30]  So who's on the phones right now?  What's up?  Who's on the phones right now?  Me, I'm trying to do, you know, multiple things.  Oh, you're doing both?  Yeah, yeah.  And I gotta come in there and clean up, so give me a few minutes.  Alright, do the phones first.  I gotta talk to the people.  I hope he listens to me.  That's Sal in there.  I guess everybody's cleaning up.  Yeah, because we did.  We're not used to, we used to be, you know, kind of, of the mindset of always being in  multiple studios.  But we're not used to it anymore.  Like now, because now that's the behind the scenes of this whole thing.  Now everybody is trying to tear down, because this whole thing came together at the last 
[03:49:00]  minute with Guy Fieri coming in and cooking steaks and everything.  So we had to have interns down at Home Depot, because apparently they need big, thick fabric  tarps to put out over the floor.  I don't know, in case any, like, steak juice gets on the ground or something.  I don't know.  But we need all these supplies.  We need to get it all done, like, overnight.  Roland was here all afternoon.  Then he went to Madonna last night for some reason.  Hopefully I'll get to talk to him about that before the morning's over. 
[03:49:30]  But we threw it all together.  Now the rest of the ONA staff is, well, they're all down there fixing everything, making it  good as new, because there is another show going on.  We started getting notes, because Guy Fieri was only supposed to be here until 9.30.  We started getting notes that we were starting to run into somebody else's.  Also, big return of Ira.  How about that?  Ira is always good for a quick appearance, and he knows when to punch out.  He doesn't wait for us to say goodbye.  He doesn't wait for, you know, a natural point for the conversation to end. 
[03:50:00]  He just stands up and walks out.  He just leaves.  That's the way to do it.  Josh in New Jersey.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  Welcome to After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, I'm kind of pissed they said you're an intern.  You got pissed about that.  Yeah, I got pretty pissed about that.  But I want to let you know, they still all forgot that you still like to dock.  I don't like to dock.  That was a forgery.  That whole production piece.  I know what you're talking about.  It's a forgery.  Oh, my God. 
[03:50:30]  Whoa, software installation.  I'm trying to hang up on him.  Making it difficult for me.  Oh, I put him back on hold.  Hang on.  Hey, Josh.  Yeah?  I put you back on hold, but I want you to know I was trying to hang up on you.  So I don't think I was...  Okay, I wasn't being polite.  Now you're hung up on.  A little pop-up window came up on this computer.  Yeah, I would say I think that was probably Guy's best slam at me is when he called me an intern.  But he did it by mistake.  I think he actually just honestly thought I was an intern because he said,  Well, I guess on a radio show there's hosts and there's interns. 
[03:51:00]  So if Guy's biggest slam was a mistake, I feel like that's even more points.  He apologized to me twice for the grievance I had, which was last time he was up here.  He squirted vodka in my mouth and claiming it was water.  He gave me...  There was something...  I think I ate steak and he said,  You gotta wash your mouth out.  You want some water?  He knew I didn't drink.  He squirted the alcohol in my mouth.  That was the problem.  And today, he apologized twice.  Garth?  Hey, Sam. 
[03:51:30]  What's up, buddy?  Hey, man.  Hey, I think Sirius Mixon is pretty ballsy for giving an intern his own show.  Listen, Garth.  As I've said before, Guy Fieri was mistaken.  He was wrong.  I'm not an intern.  But, I'm the one who got him back.  I'm the one who sat there and said,  Listen, I demand an apology.  And you know what he did?  He gave me two of them, and then he gave me one more for the whole show to enjoy.  That was an apology for the Opie and Anthony show.  And then two for Mr. Sam Roberts. 
[03:52:00]  I feel like I came out ahead.  I don't know how it played out for anybody else, but I was there.  I feel like I came out ahead.  The other huge event on today's show was Jim's new impression of Gary Sinise.  I can't get enough of it.  Jim's new Gary Sinise.  I don't know if you'd call it a character, but the fact that he developed a Gary Sinise now is just incredible.  It's wonderful.  So, it was a big show to close out a big week.  Eric, how's the worst of the week countdown shaping up? 
[03:52:30]  It's a lot of stuff this week.  It's full.  Between Fantasy Sports with Jim Florentine.  Oh, yeah.  Your Hawaiian honeymoon.  Right.  Menino.  There's a few other things.  Do you think I got my...  Matchbox 20 in studio.  Do you think I got my honor back with Guy Fieri today a little bit?  I think you spanked him.  I did, right?  Yeah.  I killed him.  Totally.  Okay, good.  He knew.  He knew, too.  He was like, okay, I think I bit off a little more than I can chew with this kid.  And then he calls me Gallagher, which is just like, what the fuck are you talking about? 
[03:53:00]  There are so many jokes you can make about my hair.  You know who you remind me of?  Who?  Sideshow Bob.  That's the easy one.  Go Sideshow Bob.  Go Carrot Top.  Do whatever you want.  Make a reference to the Boondocks.  How many people are going to tweet now that I stole their joke?  Exactly.  I get it every day.  You've been doing that for how many years?  Oh, my God.  And then the word, like, I understand and I can almost appreciate when people do it knowing  that everybody else does it just to kind of like, you know, poke at me.  The worst is when somebody actually tweets, hey, man, has anybody ever told you that you 
[03:53:30]  look like Carrot Top?  Yeah.  Or, hey, man, you know, I just realized you're starting to look like Sideshow Bob.  Okay, thanks.  I haven't heard that since the early 2000s.  Thanks for bringing that to my attention.  I didn't realize.  But, yeah, Gallagher, I've never gotten before.  I don't see the comparison at all.  Maybe when you go bald.  Yeah, but that's not going to be for a little while.  I mean, I had a birthday.  Also, the other thing I appreciated on Twitter yesterday was because yesterday, you know,  we celebrated my birthday and everything.  There were a couple of people wishing me a happy 40th birthday. 
[03:54:00]  So, what goes around comes around, people.  I love it.  Josh.  Yo.  What did you learn?  I learned that Mars is a Obama fan because Bill Clinton speaks well.  Who knew?  Yes, thank you, Josh.  I learned Obama.  Obama.  I learned that Mars wears really bad knockoff shirts.  We've been waiting here for somebody to finally bring that up because Mars has been walking  around for, Mars is our engineer here, and he keeps walking around in these t-shirts 
[03:54:30]  that are corporate logos redesigned to be some, you know, MMA thing.  Like, he had a t-shirt on today that instead, it was the Coca-Cola logo, but it said Choke  Out or something like that.  And he's got one that's the Subway logo, but it says Submit.  And another one, he's got a Yoo-Hoo shirt.  Doesn't he sound like, you tap or something like that?  Someone shops at flea market.  It's the worst.  And it's all he wears now.  It's not like he just got one shirt.  I don't know why he decided to make this choice, but there he is. 
[03:55:00]  He's smiling.  He's listening.  I would like to know.  Is he coming in?  I'm sure he is.  Because O&A aren't here.  There he is.  So you decided, is this the choice?  It's the choice of a new generation.  Don't be jealous.  Is that what it is?  Don't be jealous.  You just can't wear it.  I'm sitting there going, nobody thinks that I could choke anybody out.  I can't wear a shirt that says Choke Out instead of Coca-Cola.  You've got to see my Gatorade one.  What does the Gatorade one say?  It says Guillotine.  I love them, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:55:30]  Did you buy them?  No.  I don't buy my shirts.  Where'd you get them from?  Free.  Somebody sent them to you?  Yeah.  From the show?  No, not at all.  Nothing from the show.  Like from your dojo or something?  Yeah, guys that I know in MMA.  And they were just like, look, we're looking for some idiots to wear these shirts so somebody  buys them.  Will you do that?  And you're like, yeah, pretty sweet.  Damn, that's a good shirt.  They probably think that I'll be caught in the background somewhere in a picture that's  put out.  Or it'll come up on the air.  You know, exactly. 
[03:56:00]  You wear them every day though.  Every day.  The different ones though.  I know.  Has anybody ever come up to you and being like, wow, that's a really clever shirt?  Yes.  What?  Yes.  MMA guys, jiu-jitsu guys.  This two-year-old.  Oh, shit.  What did he say?  I don't know.  I said Chip Chipperson.  Oh, Chip Chipperson.  You don't like Sal that much.  That's not true.  You think he's got a chip on his shoulder though?  Yes.  A little bit, right?  Yes.  Yes, you do.  He's entitled.  He is, right?  Yes, he is. 
[03:56:30]  Do you think his parents are rich?  Oh, fuck it.  This motherfucker is so rich.  He don't give a fuck about the job.  So, is Sal like one of the white guys that would look down on you when you were at NYU?  Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.  You remember that.  I remember.  Mars used to go to NYU for a while.  He went to film school.  And Mars is a guy who had to struggle to get there.  He had to overcome adversity, coming from a low-income situation, having a skin tone that  was not lily white, it was actually a shade of brown, did not help you get into NYU.  That's a plus though. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, that's true, getting in.  But once you're there, you're looked down upon for it.  Yeah, but it got me in.  It got you in.  They need that quota.  But you left.  You didn't graduate.  No, I did not.  Why did you do that?  It got too expensive.  Sal didn't have to worry about that.  No, he didn't.  He didn't worry about that.  Senior projects for him and Tisch School of the Arts would have been nothing.  It's all good.  Yeah, he just makes a phone call.  Yeah, that's it.  Mommy dear.  That's it.  That's all it is.  He doesn't need to worry about free t-shirts.  He'll buy them.  Like somebody's like, here, do you want these shirts?  He's like, no, please.  Let me pay for that.  Well, for example, see that tattoo that he got? 
[03:57:30]  Fucking tattoo artist charges $180 an hour.  What?  And he did five hours?  You paid $1,000 for that tattoo?  You don't even mean anything.  No, he's a really good tattoo artist.  You paid $1,000 for that tattoo?  No.  You didn't know?  He knocked a lot of the price off.  How much?  How much did you pay for it?  I paid $500.  Oh, my God.  Plus tip?  No, I gave him a tip.  How much was the tip?  I gave him $100.  You paid $600 to have a doily tattooed on your arm.  It looks like Spirograph, Mars.  It does nothing. 
[03:58:00]  It's better than fucking autograph.  No, it's not.  It's not finished.  It's not.  You know, I might expand on it later on.  With what?  More doilies?  More doilies, yeah.  Koi fish?  No, koi fish are fucking lame.  A heart that says mom?  No.  What are you going to do?  No, a Jack White tattoo.  Well, if Jack White was like somebody who you admired and he signed your arm, then you'd  be like, yeah.  I would wash it off when I got home and say, oh, that was pretty cool.  Well, then why'd you get him to sign your arm in the first place?  No, I'm saying you.  He's stupid, right?  Why would you get him to sign your arm just to wash it off?  I think he's making reference to the Rob Zombie tattoo. 
[03:58:30]  I got Rob Zombie, too, because these are the people I admire.  Why not let them, you know, I'd wear a Rob Zombie t-shirt.  Why not carry it with me forever?  Oh, you got Gasper.  That's right.  All right.  Thank you, Mars.  I like the shirts.  Keep them up.  Don't listen to anybody.  Did you guys see?  This is Mars.  Hey, sit down.  These are the guys from the Inbetweeners.  Hi, Inbetweeners.  Welcome to the show.  You see, you guys know comedy.  You know, you know funny stuff.  Vaguely.  You see, this is Mars, our engineer.  Are you familiar with the world of MMA, jiu-jitsu, mixed martial arts? 
[03:59:00]  You see Mars' t-shirt.  At first glance, you might think that's a Coca-Cola t-shirt.  But no, my friends.  You can't look at it with a subtle glance.  Look at the details.  It says choke out.  It's clever.  That's how you think it is clever.  It's the cleverest MMA joke that's ever been made.  Maybe it is.  So how's it going, guys?  Welcome to the show.  Thank you so much.  You've got the big Inbetweeners movie is now coming to America.  A lot of people in America don't know about the Inbetweeners, though.  Most people don't.  Is that true?  Right. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  How big is the Inbetweeners in England?  It's probably the biggest thing.  It's like The Voice.  It's like The Voice.  It is.  It's The Biggest Thing since One Direction, yeah.  Now you're coming over just like One Direction did.  A little less effectively, but...  Yeah, you didn't have the big VMA performance and the thousands of screaming girls yet.  No, not yet.  Yet.  So why the decision to bring it to America?  Like, why now?  Well, it turns out you speak English over here as well. 
[04:00:00]  That's right.  Same language.  There are films in English.  Yeah.  We love to sell things.  And there's people in America...  There's people.  There's people who speak English.  Yeah, and they have money.  They have money.  And they're willing to send it.  No, we didn't really make it for anywhere apart from England, and it went quite well  in Australia and stuff, and so I think someone thought they'd take a punt on showing it over  here.  That doesn't sound like the best sell you've ever heard for a film, I'd imagine.  But that's great.  Tell me about the film.  Well, it's about four lads. 
[04:00:30]  It's very much our...  Spring break?  ...take on...  Yeah, sort of the spring break.  So the four guys, they finish their exams.  Right.  They decide to go on a crazy holiday, which would be full of girls and opportunities to  drink and...  Sure, of course.  It's a very raunchy film.  Yeah.  I mean, it doesn't pan out that way.  It doesn't pan out, but that's basically...  I mean, everyone...  That's the intention.  Yeah, exactly.  When I was 18, you were 18, I imagine that's what everyone does.  They go on this holiday with their friends to the Mediterranean somewhere, and you go,  this is going to be amazing, there's going to be girls, there's going to be booze, it's 
[04:01:00]  going to be incredible, and it never really...  The only thing I remember from doing like four of those holidays is falling out with my friends  and having to fight with my friends.  I don't think I kissed a single girl.  Or boy.  Or maybe you did kiss a boy.  You were there with your friends, you were just hanging out.  I kissed a couple of boys.  It's all good.  When you made up.  Yeah.  When did you guys...  Because you guys are young guys.  I'm young.  I'm not.  You're not.  How old are you?  I'm too old to mention it.  Okay.  But I wrote it.  I wrote the show. 
[04:01:30]  I'm not in the show, to be fair.  I'm in the show.  How old are you?  You were young when you started.  I was young when I started.  I was...  My very first audition, I was 18.  I'm now 25.  Jesus.  And I have...  I'm a father.  Did you hear that?  Jesus.  The only reaction to that was Jesus.  Because what happens is, I'm looking...  We were just talking on the show today.  I turned 29 yesterday.  Right.  And I've been sitting here, in this studio, for seven years.  Yeah.  And there's no upward movement.  It's just...  But we were just...  Plateau.  You know?  We got genuinely...  We were like, slightly starstruck by SiriusXM. 
[04:02:00]  It's amazing.  It's got an amazing thing to be doing.  That's good.  Yeah.  But guess what?  There's not like a Sam Roberts show movie coming out.  Like, I'm not here to talk about my movie.  Not yet.  Not yet.  No, but you know.  I like that.  SiriusXM.  That's the...  Maybe you need to change your attitude a little bit.  Yeah, man.  There's too much negativity surfing around in here.  We came in, we were like, Guy Fieri's in another studio here.  He's like, properly amazing.  I just got into a fight with Guy Fieri in the other studio.  I'm going to...  The trouble is, I'll turn against you, because he's my hero, so...  Well, I think we're cool now, because he apologised to me.  Wow.  That's the kind of clout that I hold. 
[04:02:30]  Did he choke out?  Yeah, no, but I had him in his t-shirt hanging out right next to Guy Fieri.  What did you...  How did you...  What happened?  Well, I don't drink alcohol.  Right.  What?  That's right.  You can probably smell me quite clearly.  You and me right now.  But Guy Fieri was in here a couple months ago, and he thought it was like a funny prank.  He said, oh, you need...  Because I ate some of his food.  I don't eat a lot of food.  I have like bad OCD and stuff like that.  So I was like gagging on steak and stuff.  And so I started like vomiting on it, basically. 
[04:03:00]  I think that might be considered an insult.  Is that right?  He might have been a bit offended by that.  Well, I told him in advance, like, I'm like, listen, this is not going to be a good commercial  for your food.  I'm going to vomit it up into the garbage can.  And he said, no, you got to try it.  I was like, okay.  And so he was like, he thought he was going to be cute.  And he was like, oh, here, have some water to wash it down, like to wash out your mouth.  And I was like, okay.  And then it started burning.  And I was like, this isn't water.  That's exactly what it was.  It was vodka.  Well, there you go.  You failed your audition there, so he could have done like a little spin. 
[04:03:30]  No wonder you've been here for seven years.  He could be sort of semi-retiring and think, you know, I'll let someone else take over  for a little while.  That was what it was.  That's what it was.  You've completely failed.  This guy doesn't eat or drink.  So you'll be sitting here for another seven years.  That's what it is.  It's about noticing opportunity.  So can I ask what you do eat?  I eat a lot of chicken and pizza.  That's all right.  I mean, it's good.  It's delicious.  Yeah.  But it's just not varied, you know.  But we worked on you because your diet was bad when we started, wasn't it?  My diet was terrible, yeah.  No, you're getting there.  Now you eat a lot of seafood and stuff, don't you?  I've always been a good... 
[04:04:00]  I've always liked fish.  Okay, okay.  Yeah, but you know, what's good is like when you're young, you don't really have to worry  about anything because you still have metabolism.  Yeah, I've got to that stage now where I'm...  Is it now starting?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what happened to me.  I was probably like 26-ish and I was like realizing I started to get like little titties.  Yeah, I'm 25 now and my head's getting rounder.  I've been living in America for...  That chiseled jaw is starting to disappear.  It's disappearing, yeah.  That's not good.  I spent three weeks in Los Angeles in July, which didn't help. 
[04:04:30]  I've been living here off and on for nine months now.  My wife's American and I've put on £20 in nine months.  You were very skinny when you started because you're not a big guy.  You don't want me to take this shit off and I really mean that.  You don't want me to take my shit off.  He's wearing one of those sort of...  James Harden.  I've got Spanx.  I'm coming out.  Absolutely Spanx from top to bottom.  I've got Spanx on my cankles.  Is that where they are?  How long were you doing the show in England before it became like when you realized this  is a huge success?  Well, we made three seasons. 
[04:05:00]  That's what it's called.  Correct.  What do they call them?  Series in England?  Series.  Yeah.  We made three seasons.  All six episodes each because that's how we do it.  So basically one America.  Yeah.  It took us four years to make 18 episodes.  And it was very difficult at the beginning because it's quite rude.  The dialogue is very...  Sure.  Rude.  Yeah.  But that kind of pans out better in England than it does here, right?  Yeah.  It's funny and it's good fun to do that and stuff. 
[04:05:30]  But you can't make an advert about that.  Right.  You can't make a commercial.  You can't say, put it on during the afternoon and say, watch this because this is what happened.  Yeah.  Because you can't show that.  You can't tell anybody what happened.  So we scraped through and...  Scraped through the first one and just about got a second one.  Yeah.  They said, all right, you can have another go.  We went, thank you very much.  Yeah.  And the channel let us make an advert of us to specifically advertise the show.  So then people actually looked at it and thought, well, this might be quite good. 
[04:06:00]  Then we got a few more people watching it.  Okay.  Then by the third series, we were just...  Superstars.  Can't walk down the street, can you?  Yeah.  You were One Direction.  But yeah, we were.  One Direction basically based a dance on our show.  They let their One Direction...  That's right.  They're huge fans.  They were tweeting about it yesterday, weren't they?  Yeah.  I was texting Harry.  I was saying, can you please...  Can you tell people that our film's coming out?  Because no one seems too bothered.  He did, yeah.  Fantastic.  It got... 
[04:06:30]  Within like five minutes or something, it got retweeted 45,000 times or something like that.  This is what we need.  Yeah.  See, my jokes about politics don't get that at all.  They don't, don't they?  No, we need One Direction to retweet your jokes about politics.  I need to be One Direction.  They'll be like, yeah!  Do you like doing the shorter seasons, series, whatever?  Like, do you think that works better for comedy than here where it's like, oh, people are  watching this.  Let's do 500 episodes of it.  I wish we could have done 500 because it was so much fun to do.  It was great, yeah.  Really?  But if we'd done 500, I'd be really happy.  And I think, you know, all the shows that I loved growing up, not all the shows, but 
[04:07:00]  a lot of the shows I loved growing up, you know, like Seinfeld and, you know, Larry  Sanders and Simpsons and stuff are all long-running American shows.  And they're brilliant.  Like, you know, there are lots of, I know lots of people over here that work on those  things.  And they're brilliantly done.  I would, you know, it's just, you know, it's just like a different thing.  I don't think it makes it better.  The difference is, though, it's written by you and another guy, Damon.  Yeah.  So we write, we've written every single word.  Oh, so like here they have like writing teams.  Team writing.  Yeah, of course.  How can the people, or is it just what people are used to in England?  Is the British attention span significantly shorter? 
[04:07:30]  I think it's to do with money.  Oh, they all like.  And basically that we get, we got paid, you know, for a year's work, we got paid about  $15,000 each to do the first season.  Okay.  So there you go.  That's not a lot.  That's not a lot of money.  That's not a lot of money.  It's a passion project.  Yeah, exactly.  Because it's a bit like doing a high school play or a musical.  Right.  It's a bit like Glee, but without the fun.  Right.  And so, yeah, so that kind of, you know, if we'd spread that between a team of 10 people,  it probably wouldn't have been enough to go around. 
[04:08:00]  So I think it's a bit of that.  It's a scale.  It's a big thing.  Well, the movie is hilarious.  Where can people see it?  It's out limited, I guess.  Limited is a nice way of putting it.  Yeah.  It's, what do they call it?  An art house.  Genuinely, it's the least art house film.  Yeah, if you're-  Boston, Minneapolis, Portland.  If you're into art-y films.  If you're into art-y films, Genuinely, normally the films you'd see at these cinemas are quite  different to this one.  The series itself, by the way, is on Netflix.  Netflix.  So people think, that's right, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm familiarised with that.  We saw it at the Union Square Theatre in New York on Broadway, 850 Broadway, and it's 
[04:08:30]  on in Portland and San Francisco and Los Angeles and Minneapolis.  Minneapolis.  All right, so you've got some cities.  Yeah, we've got, we're here.  Do you have a website that you could, people can find theatres?  At InBetweenersUSA Twitter feed.  So, at InBetweenersUSA.  And are you going to do on-demand, like, cable and all that?  I don't know.  That's the way everybody-  We'll take whatever we can get.  Let's see if there's some demand first.  It'll probably be.  We're not on-demand.  We're on-demand. 
[04:09:00]  We're just-  It doesn't seem to be any demand.  There's no demand.  Well, check out the movie.  It's InBetweenersUSA on Twitter.  Yeah, at InBetweenersUSA.  All right, so check it out.
