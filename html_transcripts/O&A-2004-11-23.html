<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast detailed here revolves heavily around the fallout from their controversial St. Patrick's Cathedral prank, their subsequent move to XM Satellite Radio, and the chaotic presence of a severely intoxicated and disruptive homeless man named Tippi Tom (or Timmy Tom, depending on the segment).  The show opens with a discussion of the prank and the hosts' need for a new, equally outrageous stunt to recapture attention.  This is interspersed with discussions about a JFK assassination video game, listener-submitted songs (especially explicit "Monster Rain" parodies),  and listener calls.  Notable callers include Lady Di, struggling with alcoholism, and Keith the Cop.  Tippi Tom, described as smelling extremely bad, repeatedly tries to intrude on the broadcast, requiring physical barriers and Lysol to manage his behavior and strong odor.  Master Poe is tasked with physically intervening if necessary.

The show’s central focus shifts to Tippi Tom’s increasingly erratic behavior, interspersed with tangents. These include a discussion of the Ron Artest NBA brawl and its legal ramifications, a listener correcting their mispronunciation of "book depository," mention of a Hmong man's mass murder in Wisconsin,  a bizarre hypothetical basketball game between an NBA team and dolphins, and a caller (Leroy from Alabama) casually describing his participation in cross burnings.  The hosts anticipate the arrival of three female guests, one a gymnast, engaging in sexually suggestive banter beforehand.  A listener song parody about child molestation is also played.  Further tangents include discussion of a $28,000 Virgin Mary grilled cheese, Linda McCartney’s allegedly terrible backing vocals on "Hey Jude," a “fresh vaginas” discussion, and an extended, uncomfortable mosquito-themed bit.  Jim Norton's antisemitic jokes about encounters at a Rite Aid are also included.

A significant portion details the hosts' attempts to wake up Tippi Tom, sleeping outside the studio, initially with humor but eventually with genuine concern for his well-being.  Audio of Anthony Cumia's mother singing a drunken "Mercedes Benz" is played, followed by a remixed version.  Upon waking, Tippi Tom becomes belligerent and vulgar, making threats and sexually explicit comments.

Another segment details Tippy Tom's extended stay in the studio bathroom, where he falls asleep while defecating.  The hosts graphically describe the situation, including soiled underwear and sleeping position.  Attempts to rouse him are recounted, culminating in Keith kicking the bathroom door open. A listener offers $2,000 for the soiled underwear.  The discussion shifts to listener "Jimmy the boat guy," who seeks help getting laid for Christmas, with Tippi Tom jokingly suggested as a potential option.  A female caller proposes setting him up with a 50-year-old virgin.  The segment also includes a news story about a 13-year-old boy abducting an exotic dancer.  A promo for Jim Norton's album and a sports update follow.

Two female guests from the band Point Blank arrive late, performing a cover of "The Devil Went Down to Georgia."  One, a former gymnast, performs a topless gymnastic routine.  Tippi Tom, now awake, removes his clothing, leading to further disgust from the hosts.  The discussion also includes a "rim job" and bathroom cleanliness, referencing a previous "homeless shopping spree" segment.

The final segment features Tippi Tom in his underwear, becoming a central point.  The hosts, along with the female guests, engage in sexually explicit discussions and actions. The guests are topless at times, and there is discussion of nudity, sexual acts, body parts, and use of whipped cream.  Tippi Tom is challenged to masturbate on air for money, an attempt that fails.  Vulgar jokes, Caligula references, and crude humor are prevalent.  Point Blank's music is played, and the show closes with promotions for their appearance and a satellite radio contest, along with crude humor and discussion about differences in male and female energy levels after sex.

[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  This now concludes the O&A Variety Hour.  Stay tuned for the Opie and Anthony show spreading across America. 
[00:05:30]  It's the O&A virus.  XM News, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything, all the time.  XM202. 
[00:06:00]  It's not souz and important, all the time just because we're having theCK servers, and we're playing around here.  It's...  The O&A has been walking on the little world and optic.  ...and said the O&A view milen which parcels their hearts and feel free to be fully humble because of that in only how many planets are. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  A couple was in a vestibule at St. Pat's doing ass sex.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Sounds great.  Eh, complete whores.  Opie and Anthony got this couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral.  The creation against the church is disrespectful.  It's a true sacrilege.  It was just a joke.  Opie's fault again.  How can we blow up our lives today?  How can we blow up our lives today?  You rocking sex.  Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie. 
[00:09:30]  Uh-oh, we're in it again.  They hire people who are artists to do a certain thing.  And then when they go too far, they suddenly wash the hands of them if they feel the heat  is too heavy.  Opie and Anthony should not have been fired.  Technically, we didn't get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while  he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think? 
[00:10:00]  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yes!  The duo has signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I played golf with old guys.  Anthony.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now at the new club of the radio.  Ho, ho, Opie. 
[00:10:30]  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony.  Opie is a big and beautiful.  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  I love Opie and Anthony.  We stink.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  Bye.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  No one 
[00:11:00]  Ha, ha, ha  Yeah  Ha  Ha  Ha  Yeah  Ha  Yeah  I have to laugh. 
[00:11:30]  Well, hopefully we'll make some people laugh today.  Good morning, everybody.  Morning.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  We like to call it the ONA virus.  Big hi to everyone that turned on their XM satellite radios overnight.  Oh, yeah, we do have some of those every ding-dong day.  It's kind of cool.  Every day we see the numbers and we have new listeners every day.  Yes.  What did you wait for, man? 
[00:12:00]  You've missed so much.  You've missed so much.  We've got to stop talking about the St. Pat's thing, though, man.  Yeah, I know.  Enough.  Enough.  Every morning.  That promo that starts the show.  Enough.  I'm starting to think we've got to do something really outrageous again  so we can stop talking and thinking about that St. Pat's thing.  That's how we got into trouble last time.  That's how it works, right?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, it's like you start listening to your last big thing, and it gets old. 
[00:12:30]  And you're like, wow, we've got to get something new.  We had the mayor's prank.  We talked about that for years.  Yeah, we drove that into the ground.  And then we did the voyeur bus thing.  We talked about that for a while.  Yeah.  And then, of course, the Sex for Sam thing in St. Pat's Cathedral,  where a couple allegedly, and they were worshipers,  and people got outraged, and we got fired.  Who doesn't know that story?  People that don't know us or the show at all know that story. 
[00:13:00]  That's why.  It's like, okay, every morning, have the nice little music.  And then, that's us, you know.  That's us on our horses.  All day, in a church, in a church.  Oh, they were in a church.  Painted blood.  Oh, wait.  Cathedral.  Yeah, well, that ecstasy of gold is us on our horses, you know.  Is that us?  As we're galloping into the studio.  As we attempt the biggest comeback in radio history.  Galloping.  Holy S. 
[00:13:30]  We got a long ways to go.  I knew we had a long ways to go when we did that Passion of 0-1-8 thing  at the Hammerstein Ballroom,  and they put together that really nice video of career highlights of you and I.  Ah, the old Jimmy Norton.  And you realized how huge we used to be.  And it was downright depressing to watch.  We used to be somebody.  We used to be somebody is right.  What happened?  So we're attempting the biggest comeback in radio history.  We are the true underdogs, and we understand that. 
[00:14:00]  We have another Monster Rain song?  Holy S.  Dude, they are coming in like...  We didn't even request Monster Rain songs.  We have one, two, at least three new ones today alone.  We didn't request these things.  Three Monster Rain songs and then a one for you, which is called...  What is it called?  Blue Jean something?  I'm glad you brought it up.  It stinks and we're not playing it.  Okay.  Sorry to... 
[00:14:30]  It stinks and I don't like it.  Sorry to dug out Doug.  He was attempting to start a new trend, which I don't mind.  Yeah.  The song is about me and my marshmallow, but this one is awful.  It really stunk.  Is it good?  It's really...  Well...  All right, really fast.  It didn't even stink like...  Compared to all the other bad ones.  I mean...  No, it's awful.  It was awful.  You know the story of me joining a frat.  Hold on as that cues up before he runs away.  This is going to be a crazy show.  I can feel it already, Anthony.  On the phone, Keith the Cop.  What's up, Keith? 
[00:15:00]  You want to talk about the story where you had to drive with your fingers out the window?  Yeah.  I got Tippi Tom in the back of my truck.  I got my head out the window.  You're bringing Tippi Tom in today?  Tippi Tom is a wreck.  Oh, no.  He is going to be priceless.  All right.  And we got women coming in today, too.  And he loses his mind over women because he's gay, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, hold on one second.  Let me get...  Give him a quick yell real quick. 
[00:15:30]  All right.  Go ahead.  Hey, Tippi Tom.  Say hi on the radio real quick.  Hello.  Tippi Tom right here.  I'm showing up.  I promise I'll be there.  And please do the best I can.  All right.  I love you.  No, no.  I don't say you love us.  A homeless gay guy.  I'm so glad he's not drinking anymore.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Remember we got him in the hospital and he had the normal, I'm Tippi Tom, and I'm now 
[00:16:00]  sober and I'm going to try to make something of my life.  Had a bit of a problem there for a while, but I'm fine now.  Right.  And now he's back to drinking.  Ah!  Keith, thank you.  Yeah, I'll be in a couple minutes, bro.  All right.  We're all over the ball field, but here's the bad song about me and my marshmallow.  So, it's really bad, and we're not going to play the whole thing, because no offense  to Dugout Doug, but he didn't, it just stinks.  He really does. 
[00:16:30]  It starts off nice, though.  Yeah.  Nice guitar.  Sounds like forever in blue jeans.  Yeah, it certainly does.  Well, it's frat boy in blue jeans, so.  Oh.  That chip's already given the eck. 
[00:17:00]  Go text back.  Block out the light, but how would I know that?  If they weren't on my face, it looks so gay.  At least it's not a marshmallow in my ass.  All right.  That's really bad.  I never actually thought I'd be craving the original forever in blue jeans. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, it goes on for another three and a half minutes, too, so we just saved the listeners  there, and now we've got to go back to the phone, because something else is going on here.  Marion, what's up?  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  How are you guys doing?  The other half of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  I heard that Diane called you guys yesterday.  Yeah.  And we're going to come up tomorrow.  What, both of you?  Yeah.  Sometime tomorrow after 7.30, we're going to come up.  Okay.  And I was wondering if you could really honestly talk to her about getting help for her alcoholism. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, yeah, because we didn't yesterday.  We did yesterday.  She doesn't want help.  We hooked her up with a guy who was going to come pick her up and take her to rehab.  Well, there was a guy last night that called her up, Jim.  Yeah.  And they were talking.  Okay, good.  Oh, that's the guy.  Yeah, and I know they were talking, because she called me up, but seriously, she does need  help.  She's out of control.  So, officially, you are announcing that she definitely needs help.  Yeah.  Because we've been trying to get this info out of you for, I don't know.  Yeah.  You guys are our friends.  Ah, well, slow down. 
[00:18:30]  Seriously.  Slow down.  No, really, and...  Look, man, we do a wacky, goofy radio show.  We get serious every once in a while.  We know Lady Di has a problem, but that's where it ends, man.  I'm not going to be responsible for her.  No, I was wondering if you could seriously tell her she does definitely need help.  All right, we'll do that tomorrow.  Okay, we'll be up tomorrow sometime after 7.30.  All right, thank you, Marion.  I'll see you guys tomorrow.  Marion, Marion.  Yeah.  So, the Retard of the Burn and Shirley coming to town tomorrow. 
[00:19:00]  That would be great.  Fantastic.  Yeah, that's true.  My brother just sent me a note.  They're ugly to begin with.  How ugly do they look at 7.30 in the morning?  Oh.  We'll find out tomorrow.  God.  So, anyway, where were we?  Because Tippi Tom's coming up.  Tippi Tom.  The Retard of the Burn and Shirley tomorrow.  Man, you know something.  We got drunk girls that are already getting wasted somewhere that are coming up to do stuff  today.  Dude, this...  What?  Tippi Tom.  It's going to stink, this whole... 
[00:19:30]  The studio's going to stink.  He gives us great radio, though.  Yeah, but the studio is going to stink.  It ain't like the old days.  We got the Lysol.  It was a little bigger.  I think it was a little further away in the old place.  It was an old place.  We didn't mind if it stunk a little bit.  This is a brand new state-of-the-art studio.  So, what, his Tippi Tom?  Oh, it's going to be horrendous.  I got to eat now.  What time is he coming?  He's on the way.  Oh, God.  My food is wrecked.  He's on the way.  Hey.  And he's drunk. 
[00:20:00]  He's going on that mic.  And he's pulling it as far away from the console as possible.  We could set up a microphone maybe outside the studio.  Could we do that?  Could be pretty funny.  How about in that room?  Is that possible?  Oh, we'll put him in that room.  It's like a little closet with the glass window where all our engineers are.  He could talk to us through the glass over there.  We'll put him on a phone.  Well, whose phone?  Is that where the studio audience sits?  I hate that, by the way.  They've got chairs lined up outside the studio that stare right at us as we're doing a radio show.  Whenever anybody comes in, they sit them in those chairs and look at us like a monkey cage. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  Awful.  Well, all right.  We've got to officially start the show now.  I've got to move my jacket to this and steal my shit.  This is really awful.  Steal it.  He'll just stink it up.  You know, aren't movie homeless so nice and sweet and endearing?  Oh, right away, someone wants to know.  Real life stinks.  Yeah, that's true.  Jimmy from Massachusetts, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, Jimmy.  How did your audition go yesterday?  Oh, Jimmy. 
[00:21:00]  How did it go?  Well, thank you for asking.  It was actually pretty good.  Better than I thought it would be.  Oh, really?  Yeah, but it doesn't matter.  I won't get it.  But whenever I do something like that, it's...  I think you're going to get this one.  Yeah, well, I would like it.  You're perfect for the role.  Oh, one last thing, guys.  Thank you, man.  I felt it went pretty well.  Goody.  I mean, really, good feedback.  I mean, you can never tell, dude.  Whenever I think I do good, it means I stunk.  Whenever I think I bombed, I get it.  Do they tell you the same thing when you're done?  They're just like, thank you.  Hey, thanks for coming in.  But everyone was going in.  Some chick was auditioning for the part of the underage girl, too. 
[00:21:30]  Oh.  So they had like a bunch of 15 and 16-year-old or 18-year-old girls.  Stop it.  Oh, lovely.  Really?  So we were all in and out in 30 seconds.  Yeah, what's the role again?  A guy named Jackson who plays a guy who works in a porn shop and is kind of selling porn that  features a young lady who's not 18.  You're perfect.  Yeah.  Did you see some other people auditioning for the same part?  No, but I'm...  No?  Yeah, I'm sure there was a couple...  There was three other guys there, but I think there was a couple different parts being read  for.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a producer's read, so it was fine. 
[00:22:00]  All right.  I'm sure I'll laugh it up.  Good luck to you.  Thanks.  I hope it goes good.  Yeah.  I guess we've got to talk about U2 again.  Oh, I know.  Our listeners hate when we talk about U2, but they're all the rage.  And I staggered out of my apartment yesterday after taking my nap.  Got to take the nap after the show every day.  Napski?  It's a little 40-minute nap, and then I'm good for the day.  It's the weirdest thing.  So I stagger out to go get lunch or something, and there's U2 on a flatbed truck.  I'm thinking I'm seeing something. 
[00:22:30]  I mean, I'm seeing things, I should say.  And they just go flying by, and they're singing and talking to the crowd.  And then people are running down Columbus Avenue like they're running after the Beatles.  Really?  And they're running for blocks and blocks.  There's hundreds of people just following the flatbed truck as they go.  I guess they were filming a video or something, Ben?  And then they had a concert down in Brooklyn.  Under the Brooklyn Bridge yesterday.  Sick.  Sick.  Kiss did that a few years ago.  Remember that?  What?  Yeah, well, Kiss performed it.  Well, the Stones did the flatbed truck years ago. 
[00:23:00]  The Stones did the same thing.  But it was mayhem.  Yeah, they started way uptown and went all the way down.  Did they end in Dumbo?  Yes.  Oh, you know what?  They followed our Voyeur bus route.  How funny is that?  That's what I thought.  When I saw this yesterday, I was thinking about our old Voyeur bus thing.  Because, I mean, the flatbed truck is going.  People on every corner taking pictures.  And like I said, hundreds of people just trying to keep up with the thing on foot.  It was wild.  It was cool to see, actually.  It went right by me. 
[00:23:30]  I don't think Dumbo is going to take off like Tribeca or Soho.  It's pretty desolate down there.  I just hate that they throw these names at.  What is it?  Down Under Brooklyn Overpass?  Something like that, yeah.  Down Under Brooklyn.  That's Dub.  Yeah, Down Under...  Down...  You're right.  It's something like that.  See?  It ain't taking off.  They make it fit it.  Tribeca.  What is that?  Triangle Below Canal. 
[00:24:00]  Okay, there you go.  And Soho?  South of Houston.  Right.  And then there's Noho now, too.  And Homo.  Yeah, that's what's showing up in a few minutes.  Homo is Chelsea.  Homo.  I live in Homo.  Listen, we're trying to get the gay out.  We did pretty good yesterday.  What is Dumbo?  The listeners are hating the gay stuff still.  Are they really?  Ben, no.  We don't really care.  Oh, you know what?  I think this qualifies as the midget sighting of the day as well, because Bono. 
[00:24:30]  You saw Bono yesterday.  All five foot four of them.  He is small.  So how is this show, man?  It's crazy.  20,000 people.  It's nuts.  Billy Mack got me into a, what is going to be Will Smith's new apartment.  Fucking sick.  Top floor apartment.  I don't understand.  Ben just gets everywhere.  I hope he could have gone.  I called you.  Earl showed up.  How big is it?  It's pretty sick.  It's got views in every direction.  It's top floor, Panos apartment, right overlooking all of Manhattan.  It's really nice.  But it's, you know, under construction.  So sick.  But it was just total pandemonium over there.  Nuts. 
[00:25:00]  Pandemonium.  It was nuts.  They came over the Manhattan Bridge.  It was sick.  And then they got stuck in traffic.  So it was hilarious.  So it was pretty bad.  Great traffic.  I would be pissed off if I was stuck behind them.  They were the talk of the city yesterday.  Because they were stopping along the route to play for, you know, play a song or play  a little bit.  And then Bono had the mic on the whole time just talking to people.  I guess they played right out here, like 57th and 7th or something.  And then they played in Times Square.  And I guess it's all going to be part of a video that they're shooting, right? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Ah, I watched the news.  Oh, here it is.  Down under Manhattan Bridge Overpass.  Ah, Manhattan Bridge.  And we had a...  This guy's from San Diego and he knew.  And he knew.  Brian.  Anthony, you retard.  Hey, fuck off, dick fuck.  I'm in San...  Why am I a retard?  I'm in San Diego.  Yeah.  Down under Manhattan Bridge Overpass.  Stay there, you sailor fucker.  You retard.  Call yourself a New Yorker.  I didn't say anything.  What am I...  I'm yelling that I'm Mr. New York. 
[00:26:00]  Mr. Information.  Can I tell you something?  Cock.  I never heard that term until today.  What?  Hope there's a big earthquake.  And it cracks off San Diego and you drown, dickhead.  Dude, what's wrong with you today?  He's an asshole.  Calling me out.  Anthony, you retard.  I brought it up because I didn't know what it meant.  And I hear everyone using it.  I didn't say I'm Mr. New York Information, Mr. San Diego.  Go to sleep.  It's early.  What's wrong with you? 
[00:26:30]  It's 3-20 there.  Are you all right?  San Diego.  You didn't get your sleep in?  I got plenty of sleep.  Well, I was playing that stupid JFK shoot him in the head game.  You know what?  For hours and hours.  All the news stations were just outraged by this game.  Oh.  And, you know, I was laughing because we were talking about it yesterday.  Basically, it's the JFK game.  Yeah.  JFK assassination game.  You know, all our listeners, they're trying to find it.  Is there a link up on opianthony.com?  There should be.  It's jfkreloaded.com. 
[00:27:00]  JFKreloaded.com?  JFKreloaded.com.  It costs like $10, though.  You've got to download it.  You can play a version where you can't shoot him or something for free.  It's ridiculous.  Why would you want to?  I know.  Just to get the view from...  Yeah, yeah.  You could download it and get a view like that.  But, you know, I paid my fee yesterday right when I got home and popped it in.  And talk about a potato chip game.  It's just you've got to keep trying to get a better score.  What's a potato chip? 
[00:27:30]  What does that mean?  You just keep going.  You know how you can't stop eating potato chips?  They say that about some of the games.  It's one of those games that you just...  It's very simple.  There's not much to it.  The graphics are really good.  You're up in the sixth floor.  That's when you start the game.  You start off at the sixth floor.  You have a view overlooking Dealey Plaza.  And you have a little crosshair.  To zoom in through the scope, you hit the right mouse button.  And then you've got the scope view.  Zoomed in, crosshair.  Nice.  Now, here it comes.  Around the corner, you see the motorcade start coming. 
[00:28:00]  And there's JFK and Jackie waving.  You've got Connelly and his wife sitting in front of them.  And then the driver and Secret Service guy in the front seat.  And it looks just like Dealey Plaza pretty much?  The view you've seen a million times?  Yeah, the one thing that they're missing, though, is the crowd.  You hear a crowd of noises, but you really don't see the crowds on the sides of the street.  See, that would be cool.  I know.  Because when you're messing up with the shooting, they're pretty hilarious to just take out some innocent bystanders. 
[00:28:30]  You hear it, but it's pretty much, I guess, they're concentrating on the shots.  Now, the object of the game, because what they're saying on the news, they're not really giving you the object,  is to recreate what happened.  Your score is based on your best recreation of what actually happened.  I don't have a problem with this one.  I don't either.  I loved it.  We've all talked about the JFK assassination for years and years and years.  And they've debated whether Oswald was able to do that from that position.  So, of course, why wouldn't you want to try to see if you could do it? 
[00:29:00]  41 years later, the technology is there with your computer to give some kind of a, you know, you can try it yourself.  See if it can be done.  Can you only look out that one window, or can you look out the other one when he's coming up?  You can look out the window that right when he turns the corner to come into the plaza before he takes the corner.  Coming toward you?  Yeah, he's coming toward you.  So, he's coming toward you.  The object to recreate it as best you can.  You get points. 
[00:29:30]  1,000 points is the most you can get.  I got 485 out of 1,000 was the best score I could get.  Sometimes I got negative points because I just lost it.  Did you just panic?  I did.  He comes around the corner.  I'm like, all right.  He panicked.  So, he starts firing.  The best score I got was the one where I shot him kind of in the neck first with my first shot.  The second shot went through Connolly's shoulder and into his stomach.  Jesus.  Into Kennedy's stomach.  And the third shot was just the money shot.  Very proud.  His head exploded in a red mist. 
[00:30:00]  His brains fell out.  He slumps over.  And I felt so good about myself.  Oh, you're a handsome man, Mr. Kulian.  And that was one of my best scores.  And where the bullets end up affects your score.  You get extra points for that.  You get extra points for timing.  If the timing between your shots was accurate like it was that day.  For not injuring Jackie. 
[00:30:30]  For not injuring Connolly's wife.  Did you take her out in some of your attempts?  Well, let me tell you.  When I screwed up a few of the shots, like the first shot I knew it was bad and I couldn't get a good score.  I took out the driver.  The limo driver.  And it just stops.  The car stops right there in Dealey Plaza.  See, that's not accurate.  The car would still go because it's downhill at that point.  I don't know.  And I think you need the bystanders.  So the limo goes crashing into the bystanders.  Well, when I shot the driver, the car just stopped.  So I unloaded into the car. 
[00:31:00]  I killed Jackie.  I killed the wife.  I started shooting the cops that were on the motorcade route.  They show blood and guts and all that stuff?  Yeah, there's blood.  And then when you're done, they show you a film and you could see from any location.  You could see what you did from any of the locations around Dealey Plaza.  Following the limo from the grassy knoll.  Yeah, I was going to ask.  Do you have the option to shoot from behind the picket fence?  No, they don't.  I see them doing some add-ons to this game. 
[00:31:30]  This is pretty cool.  One thing that they do also when you're done, they show you bullet trajectories.  So they show you very accurate where your bullet went in green and then what it hits  and then afterwards where it ends up in red.  So you'll see a line.  Some of the shots, like, just missed Kennedy's head.  And you can move the car around and see where the bullet trajectory was  and see that you just missed his head.  Or you can see where it hit the limo and ricocheted off. 
[00:32:00]  So very accurate as to where you put your shots.  And it's one of those things where I was like,  all right, I'll do this a couple of times and then I'll play Ever Queer 2.  But after you're done with one, you go, all right, I've got to try one more.  You've got to try it again.  I've got to try it again.  I've got to try it again.  I've got two hours I was just trying to get my score up.  Then when I felt confident, I went online and participated in their little competition.  They have an online competition across the country  where you have ten chances to give it your best shot. 
[00:32:30]  And I got 450 on the online competition.  Was that good, though, compared to everyone else?  It's good as far as I killed Kennedy.  I injured Connelly.  I didn't hit Jackie or Connelly's wife.  I left a bullet where my second shot ended up where it was supposed to be.  It was a fatal head shot on Kennedy.  So, you know, the score was – I could see people doing much better  with a little more practice.  I got to – I kind of – I can't remember where the actual shots went. 
[00:33:00]  What was the first shot?  Do you remember?  It was a miss, right?  First shot was – well, that's if you believe that there was –  See, that's just it, too.  I think you're going on the report.  I don't know if they acknowledged that there was actually a missed shot.  I know the one bullet fragment hit James Taig.  I think the other bullet supposedly, I think, injured both of them.  Do they acknowledge a missed?  Does the Warren Commission acknowledge a missed?  My brother's in the studio.  He's literally an expert on the assassination. 
[00:33:30]  This guy, he hangs out on message boards, and he's obsessed with the damn thing.  Because I hate fuckers, man, and most of them in this game, you know,  the whole whatever, the Warren Commission.  Yeah, the Warren Commission, the first shot missed.  They acknowledged that miss.  Yeah, they acknowledged it.  First shot missed.  It hits the curb, hits James Taig.  Like, the second one goes through both.  Third one hits him in the head.  Wow, so now I got a miss with the first one in order to do this accurately?  Yeah, that's probably what gets your score up.  I got a miss with the first one.  The second one has – because there were some times where the first shot,  I hit Connolly but missed Kennedy. 
[00:34:00]  So then the second shot, I had to hit Kennedy without hitting Connolly again,  and the third shot's the money shot.  That's why your score's a little low.  That first shot's got to be a miss.  And then there were some times where I took four shots,  which is – you know, you lose points also for doing anything over three shots.  It starts minus, like, 100 points.  So there were some times where Kennedy's kind of injured but not dead,  and the car's well past my range where I could shoot,  and I'm just laying shots into Jackie's back.  Call him to Parkland Memorial. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, I'm out of the car, yeah.  They should really do that with this game, just expand it to the point  you can just follow him to the hospital and take care of business.  Right now it's pretty much, you know, take care of business,  suffocate him with a pillow.  It's very entertaining.  Shoot Jackie for being a distraction.  Juicy little ass of hers.  Little pillbox hat goes flying off her head when I miss.  Oh, God.  You hear a little whee. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, jeez.  It's very entertaining.  It's very addictive.  Like I said, you just keep going over and over again.  But now I can't believe I got a – I was trying to hit with that first shot.  Maybe that's what I got to do to get that score up.  Have you ever been to Dealey Plaza?  No, I've never been.  It's a freak show.  We went on the 39th anniversary two years ago yesterday.  We were there.  And they have a whole thing every year, whole thing.  And people come out of the woodwork.  Like I was this – they all have photographs of who they were. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, wow.  Oh, that's my brother, man.  I'd love to meet some of those people.  Beverly Oliver.  Oh, the babushka lady.  The babushka lady, yeah.  Yeah, she swears she's there.  She swears she's the lady, and she shows where she was standing, and she's signing autographs  and getting her photos taken with everybody.  I mean, it's crazy.  And then there's obscure people like, you see this guy over here that had – way up on the grass.  That was me.  And they'll tell you what they remember from that day.  Hey, what – the shot that hit Connelly and Kennedy, where did it go? 
[00:36:00]  Don't even start there.  I know.  I know it was that weird twisting bullet thing.  The magic bullet.  But where was – Connelly was genuinely injured.  Where was he hit?  It started down here.  Right up.  Lower back.  Yeah, near the armpit.  Near his armpit.  It went in kind of elongated.  It went in from behind.  Yes.  Now, this is where I'm screwing up, too.  I'm taking the shot from head on.  Now, I've got to wait until they make the corner and hit him from –  You're shooting when they come down before they make the turn?  Yeah.  Oh, you silly dude. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, it's the best shot, asshole.  It's the best shot.  Why don't you just go to Love Field and pick him off when they land?  That's why – because when you were saying your score was 450, I'm like –  I'm trying to be cool here.  I'm like, well, that's not really that good.  But because all I –  The only reason I'm getting that score is because I'm taking out the targets.  You've got to wait for her to make the turn.  That's a rough goddamn shot.  It's a whole different game, though.  Through the leaves.  Through the tree.  You can't shoot.  That's tough.  You're shooting him on that angle. 
[00:37:00]  Straight on is perfect for the head shot.  I know.  Right when they zoom around that corner, when I see him coming head on, I'm on my rifle.  I'm taking my shot.  I mean, I understand why you're doing it.  The truth's on your side, Bubba.  Dude, what are you doing?  I'm just trying to kill the guy.  Why don't you just shoot out the tires before it makes the turn?  Make it a lot easier.  That's a hard shot.  Okay.  They make the corner, right?  Yeah.  Now, I have a shot when they're turning, as they're turning, from the side. 
[00:37:30]  Now, that can't be done either.  I don't think so, right?  I tried it once, and it went right through Kennedy and hit Jackie, who's sitting next to him.  So, I got to wait now.  They slow down for a very short period of time when they make that corner.  And I guess that's when I got to rattle.  What was wrong with that limo driver?  Yeah, bad move.  Very bad move.  I got to rattle off three shots after he makes that turn.  After the turn, it's all facing away from you. 
[00:38:00]  All right, let me tell you something.  That thing doesn't slow down for very long before they take off, and then it's an impossible shot.  Too bad you can't shoot from the knoll.  Maybe that's what they're trying to prove here.  Like, look.  All right.  Try yourself.  This is impossible.  I got to try this now.  All right, let's see what you do.  He's smiling and waving, coming at me.  I'm like, yeah, look at his face.  I got the shot.  Too bad you can't go to the hotel and just poison him.  That'd be a little easier.  You can't recreate it and shoot him on the way down the street.  What an ass I am.  You really are, man. 
[00:38:30]  I'm just on loan.  God.  I'm just taking the shot.  Okay, now I know what I got to do.  You should just run in the street with some chloroform.  Callback from an old show.  Oh, great.  Thank you, everybody.  Now, if we would have had a computer here, and I would have demonstrated, it would have  been funny to see Jim go, what are you doing?  Of course.  You can't shoot him now?  Dude, even I know that.  And I'm stupid when it comes to that stuff.  I have cancer on my neck.  I've had it for years. 
[00:39:00]  This is Louisiana, boss.  Who do you know who your daddy is?  It's because your mama told you so.  Yeah, Dealey Plaza, though, it's a freak show every year.  They come out of the woodwork, and they sell all sorts of stuff.  How about the happy people sitting on the X taking pictures, all like group hugs.  There's an X on the street where he was shot.  They paint an X there, and people like taking their pictures.  Smiley kids, like, hey.  Yeah.  I got a shot on the X suite.  He took one of me.  I just stood there like I was having a moment, but it was great. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, right on the X.  Were you looking up at the window?  I don't remember.  I was just really embarrassed.  I was just taking the fucking picture, you know, because I'm just humiliated just staying  there.  But we got it done.  You actually got your picture with a place.  But every year, there are people there 24 hours a day selling all the conspiracy stuff.  Oh, I don't doubt it.  Do you remember some of the conspiracy stuff that was just the ridiculous ones?  I'm going to go and open a little booth.  I'm the guy that took the shot from the front.  Right.  That's my theory.  Jack Ruby was at like a hot dog stand shooting, and they have pictures of him. 
[00:40:00]  All guys are garbage.  It's ridiculous.  And these people swear on it, too.  Like, look, I got proof Jack Ruby was at the hot dog stand.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Natalie Oliver is the one she claimed she was filming from that angle, right?  Yeah, and the FBI agent took her camera or something.  I don't know if she's a whack job or not.  I walked up to her with our brother Quinn and said, you're a handsome woman.  She's like, I've never been called handsome before.  And she just, she's holding court over, like, hundreds of people just listening to her.  It's crazy.  You have no idea if she's telling the truth. 
[00:40:30]  And all these rubes, they're like, really?  Oh, people that just want to buy everything and believe everything.  Like, talking to these people like they're doing their own investigation.  She's a very famous person, though, associated with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Someone is saying there's a bonus level in the game, Anthony.  I heard Hank Bowers will show up every once in a while.  My brother knows it all.  He argues with these freaks almost weekly.  We were calling Jimmy from there, remember?  Yeah.  You were, like, leaving him weird messages.  Yeah.  I was doing things.  Phil from New Hampshire, what's up?  How's it going, guys? 
[00:41:00]  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  If you put the blood option on.  Yeah.  And you score over 900 points.  Yeah.  To the hidden level.  Really?  What does it do?  You end up in a plane with your wife, and you have to try and land a plane at Martha's Vineyard.  Oh, God.  Hey, that's funny.  That is pretty funny.  Hey, guys.  It turns into a flight simulator.  You have your yapping wife behind you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, John, John.  That's good.  Let's say hi to Dan in Jersey. 
[00:41:30]  What's up, Dan?  Then you've got to rape a girl on the front lawn of a compound.  Dan?  Yeah.  Hey.  I just want to ask me.  The second shot, it hits Connelly.  Yeah.  It goes through JFK first.  Right.  It goes through JFK first.  Mm-hmm.  And then hits Connelly.  And then it goes through.  Allegedly.  Which is impossible from the front.  That's so funny.  You're shooting from the front.  I'm ricocheting off a building.  I'm trying to get it to come back at him. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  I'm really using the magic bullet.  It makes a U-turn.  That's fantastic.  You're incorporating the matrix in your game play.  I like level three, where you've got to beat a teenage girl with a golf club.  You jerk off in the tree.  It's extra points.  Let's go to Clay in New Orleans.  Clay?  Oh, Clay.  Clay in New Orleans.  Hello, Clay.  Clay, Bertrand.  Anthony, I'm really disappointed you're concerned with an undesirable classic character. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  I just want to punch out.  You know exactly what to punch out.  You know.  All right.  Well, we'll try the new way, and let's see if your score can get a little higher.  I will so try the new way.  I wish we had our gear here, our computers and stuff.  We'd be in that office for hours.  All right.  There's a lot of commotion outside the studio.  What is that?  Ben, what's up?  That should be Tom is just out of control.  Does he just stink?  He stinks, and now he's touching Steve.  He's changing.  Steve's touching. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, man.  And Keith is going, you sit over there.  Oh, my God.  Look at him.  And Master Poe is wiping down everything he touches with Lysol.  You want to hear something even funnier, too?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Doesn't he look like, it looks like the scene from The Stand where Stu Redman's in that.  Wow.  He's in that room, the germ room.  He's behind the glass.  I don't want to let him in here.  I might get the Captain Trips.  I smell from here.  I don't want a jobs mask.  I read it, but I didn't see the film.  What's up, Keith? 
[00:43:30]  What's going on?  I happened to stumble across Tippi Tom on my way into work today, and he was very excited  because he was online to get his radio last week at Union Square, and he thought he was  coming up to...  See, those are the people that were online to get the...  He'll tell you the story.  He said he was online.  There was a lot of homeless people online for their free radios.  I was online to get a radio.  All right.  We'll get Tippi Tom in a few minutes here.  Do we have to bring him in here?  Yeah, of course.  Is there any way we can have a mic brought out there? 
[00:44:00]  You've got to take one for the team.  Can we wrap him in, like, plastic or something?  Uh...  Oh, we have a mic out there?  Yeah, well, we can.  Dude, if we can not bring him in...  We have to bring him in for the interaction, and you know that.  I'm going to vomit.  I will throw up.  You're the furthest away from the door.  You'll be all right.  You'll smell it from there, though.  I will.  He's going to...  You know what it's going to happen?  You know what I'm afraid of?  It's going to stink the room up.  These clothes will have to be thrown away.  Well, you can wash the smell out.  I don't want to be in there.  No, you can't.  You don't touch them.  I don't want to bring it into my house. 
[00:44:30]  Oh.  To my house where my children sleep?  And if that looks like such an expensive shirt, I'm with you now.  Jesus.  Where my wife and I sleep, where my children come play with their toys.  All right.  If I see a blonde wig on the table, I'll know I have a partner.  Wow.  Very good.  Very good.  Very good.  Yeah, we got it.  We got it.  All right.  We'll bring Tibby Tomlin in in a few minutes.  Oh.  Okay. 
[00:45:00]  What?  We got to eat first.  Yeah, we got to eat first.  Okay, that I'm putting my foot down.  That's right.  No way.  Until we eat, I do not want him in here.  Well, at least get a mic, because after the break, we want to talk to him at the worst.  All right.  Chemistry is checking in on the email, Anthony.  Yeah.  Just want to thank you guys for playing my song parody today.  So glad you guys did it and didn't tool on me.  That would have ruined my day.  While recording it, I was doing the overdubs with my window open, and I was yelling, get  your cock out, over and over again. 
[00:45:30]  Get your cock out.  And then I heard chattering from below my window.  Apparently, a few of my neighbors could hear me recording my vocals, but couldn't hear  the music pumping through the headphones.  I never felt like more of a creep.  I just kept yelling, get your cock out, like some deranged gay porno star with Tourette's  syndrome and a bad case of AIDS sores.  I imagine the only thing more embarrassing is actually being caught under a porch by my neighbors.  By the way, I'd love to perform at a road show, wishful thinking, I know, spreading  the virus, chemistry.  And then he writes, spell my name right, faggot.  Well, that's how they said it was spelled. 
[00:46:00]  It's K-H-E-M.  That's what I said, but he messes it up at the end, too.  It's K-H-E-M-Y-S-T-R-I.  That's not the way to spell chemistry.  So as we go to break, why don't we play the latest...  Why wouldn't you take the shot when he's driving down the street?  That's the big question.  That's why they think it was triangulation of crossfire.  That's why they say it would be stupid.  They would have shot from that way.  Yeah.  If you wait for him to make that, it's a horrid shot. 
[00:46:30]  Well, ask Tippy Tom.  He looks like one of the three hobos they arrested, so he might have some insight.  Clean nails.  Look at his shoes.  Fresh collar.  That dog don't haunt.  All right.  As we go to break, we'll play chemistry's latest...  And a good day to you, Seth.  ...monster rain song.  Get your cock out.  Get your cock out.  And I think we have three new Monster Rain songs we've got to get to today.  Great.  We didn't even ask for these things.  The listener's just taking the ball and running with it, Anthony.  Take care. 
[00:47:00]  Get your cock out.  Jimmy says, get your cock out.  Put my cock in your mouth  Put your face south while we're under the house

[01:26:30]  Tippy Tom is out cold  Outside the studio  I've never seen anyone  Sleep like that  Looks like his neck  Is going to snap  Yeah  He's all right  Let's say hi to Mark in Boston  What's up Mark  Hey guys  How you doing  Pretty good  What's going on  You know  I'm a little disappointed  In you guys last night  I was listening to the replay  In the West Home  Yeah  And you're talking about  That stupid basketball fight  Yeah  So granted  It's pretty funny  But then you get this  You know  This chick from California 
[01:27:00]  Calls in and wants to  You know  Be the sexiest chick in America  Yeah  And you make me wait  For 15 minutes  You're talking about  The damn fight  Well cause we were obsessed  With the damn fight  Yeah but come on  You gotta admit  The sexiest  You know  Chicken America  Hey look  We got to it  We got to it  You know what  We didn't know  It was going to be  As good as it ended up being  We've blown off things  To get to a girl  That wants to do something  On the show  And then they stink  Yeah well  You know  Last night  I was almost done  With my commute  Time that thing started  Oh that's why 
[01:27:30]  Well you had to sit  In the driveway  There's nothing wrong with that  You know  My neighbors go out there  And listen to me  Listen to that shit  Sitting in the dark car  For a while  I don't know man  I'd get a bad rap  I'd end up like  One of your bits  Alright well  Then you should have  Listened to it  On the replay  Alright Mark  Thank you  Yep  Speaking of that fight  Now they're  Now they're trying to say  That the fans  Are out of control  Yeah well  Everyone's spinning it  You know  The teams  Are spinning it  And uh  Now there's lawyers  For the  For the  A couple of people 
[01:28:00]  That were  Were hit  In the stands  And they're suing  It's just  It's ridiculous  And the news  Can't get enough of it  Neither can the people  You know what  This comes down to  We love it  Because uh  All the newspapers  Are showing all the other  Incidents in recent  Months  Yeah  And years  The fans are just fed up  Is what it comes down to  When we were growing up  You go to a  Baseball game  A basketball game  Hockey game  What have you  You pay whatever  It was at the time  50 cents  It would cost to get it  I don't know 
[01:28:30]  Whatever  Let's say  I remember when it was  A nickel  Let's say  10, 20 bucks  Yeah  Alright  I mean  The cost of these tickets  Are so outrageous  The parking  You order beers  At 8, 10 dollars  A piece  Hot dogs  You're spending a bloody  Fortune to go to these games  And I think  A lot of these fans  Are like  You know what  For the money I'm spending  I should see something  Pretty damn cool  A little more than  Just the game  Right  They feel like  They're owed something  I'm not saying  It's right  But that's the mentality  Of a lot of these people  In the stands 
[01:29:00]  You know  You're paying so much money  That you should have  The ability to lob a cup  And smack one of the players  And it turns out  That guy has a major record  Huh  The guy that  That threw the first cup  Yeah yeah  He's got like  Assault  Forgery  Dewey  One was  Assault  With intent  To cause great bodily harm  Other than death  So it's like  Everything right up  To murder  That's like taking 
[01:29:30]  Without killing  Taking like a golf club  To the kneecap  Or something  To the head  And just  Like  It seems like  It's like  Trying to kill someone  And then you didn't kill him  But they're saying  He didn't try to kill him  You just want to hurt him  Really bad  Great bodily harm  They're probably  Pressing charges on him  For something  Obviously  Maybe he just  Took a sander  To someone's face  Knowing it would take  A real long time  To actually kill you  There you go  But would do a lot of damage  Do a lot of damage  Probably won't kill you  I'm thinking scenarios  In my head now  Anthony  The guy  Is a thug  Yeah  He's 
[01:30:00]  And he's the guy  That his pictures  In the paper  His pictures  On all the  CNN website  And Fox News website  He's a celebrity  Maybe he did some  Three Stooges  Moves on somebody  Is that  Great bodily harm  With the two fingers  Into the eyes  Just over and over again  Woo woo woo  When you wave  Your hand up and down  And then side to side  And smack him in the face  You know that stuff  Over and over again  Yell at me  Why do you want to  Yell at me today  I'm such a nice guy  Paul what's up  Why do you want to 
[01:30:30]  Yell at me  Well I don't want  To yell at you  You're so  Your hair's so  Tussleable  How can I want to  Yell  Yelling  How the hell  Can you justify  What the  You're basically  No no no  I didn't say  Justify  But you kind of  Can see  What's going on  In these people's heads  After you spend  All this money  To go to these games  Well these fans  Are asses then  They spend all this money  So it gives them  The right to throw  Stuff at these guys  I didn't say  It gives them a right  I'm just giving you  The reason that  People may be acting up 
[01:31:00]  Some of these people  Are stupid  And probably believe  That since they're  Spending so much  That it gives them  Certain freedoms  Of course you don't  Have the right to  Throw anything out  At these games  But you know  People are on edge  I mean I go to  I was a season ticket  Holder for the Islanders  And these people  Would lose their  Effing minds  Because they're not  Seeing great hockey  And the tickets  Are like $100 apiece  And the parking  And the food  And the beer  I mean it's getting  Ridiculous the prices  So I think people  Are very edgy  Because they know 
[01:31:30]  How much money  They're spending  At these sporting events  It doesn't make it right  Of course not  Well that's fine then  I just wanted to make sure  You weren't going overboard  Like a lot of people  Are in the media today  You know what I mean  No  I'm trying to defend  The fans a little bit  Because you know  It's just getting  Outrageous  You know  You can't go to  These games anymore  Unless you  Take out a second mortgage  That's a lot of money  Exaggerated humor  Always works  Thank you Paul  You know  Someone was saying 
[01:32:00]  They want my first born  They were saying  This morning  That these guys  You know  Play one game  In the NBA  And they make more  Than most people  Make in a year  Yeah  So they should be able  To take  You know  You know  Razzing  They take a cup of beer  In their face  Every once in a while  They should be able  To kind of  Walk away from that  Instead of causing  More problems  Because you know  If Ron Artest  Just took that  The security guys  Would have got that guy  No problem  And it would have been 
[01:32:30]  Taken care of  You know  They're saying  You know  You make all that money  You should be able  To have some fans  Yell at you  And every once in a while  If it happens  If someone throws something  You should be able  To kind of  Turn away from it  It's called  Being a professional  Exactly  You're a professional  This guy Bill Paulson  Was one of the guys  That were punched  In the head  And neck  When  Stephen Jackson  Stephen Jackson  Stephen  Stephen  I never know  If it's a V  Or a PH  Yeah I always go  For the even  Oh yeah so do I  But you know 
[01:33:00]  With black people  It's very hard  You just don't know  It's probably Paul  It's spelled Stephen  Yeah  And who knows  He was punched  And he's suing  It's one of the first  Lawsuits to come out  Of this  And he's quoted  It says  Actually the way  It's written  It sounds like  He could be talking  Like  If you notice  I'm trying to get away  And he's still hurting me  That's what it said  He's still hurting me  And in fact  I didn't realize  Until after 
[01:33:30]  I saw the replay  That he's still  Coming after me  He's being held back  By other people  But he's still  Coming to hurt me  Should have taken  His shoes and glasses  And defended himself  I was there  To watch a ball game  And I was assaulted  By big negroes  They beat me  About their head  And neck  And my shoes  Fell off  And he broke  My glasses  And I can't see  God damn it  Old school  Paulson said 
[01:34:00]  Artest started  Punching his friend  When he was  Held down  By his arm  And he was  Yelling at him  Saying  Did you throw it  Did you throw it  See that's what  Artest looked like  He was holding  Some guys  And questioning them  He's doing a little  Questioning  That's great  He didn't hit that guy  He didn't hit the guy  He kind of pushed him down  And he was holding him  And saying  Did you throw it  And then  You know  He got into the hitting later  Unbelievable 
[01:34:30]  I was very injured  And now they're asking  For pictures  And video  From other sources  I've seen every angle  I think  Someone was on the news  Saying  You know  Any witnesses  To the event  We want you to come forward  Any pictures  What do you need  What more do you need  Whole movies of the guy  He  You could see  Everything that happened  Yeah  You could see  Everybody involved  That's it  So that's what people  Are talking about today 
[01:35:00]  Whether or not  The fans are just  Getting out of control  And then now  You were telling me  About the hunting thing  A six person  Has died by the way  In Wisconsin  You might have heard  The story  A group of hunters  Had like a tree stand  And the southeast  Asian guy  Yeah  Didn't like that  So he killed six people now  Southeast Asian guy  Who apparently  They have problems with  Up there  Where the hell are they  Where was this  What state  Wisconsin  Wisconsin 
[01:35:30]  I didn't know  There were southeast  Asian people  In Wisconsin  His name is  Che Vang  Wait can I go backwards  For a second  We do that all the time  Anthony talking about  That pistons  I like that  Hey I like that new pit  Why don't we take  A phone call here  Anthony in Oceanside  Yes Anthony  What's happening  Owen A  Hey  Hello Jimmy  Hi fella  The highlight of that fight  I don't know who it was 
[01:36:00]  Slid down the baseline  By the bench  And he just clocked that guy  Oh yeah  That was Jermaine O'Neal  Oh was it  I think it was Jermaine O'Neal  The sliding punch  Into that little fat guy  Yeah  He did a little pirouette  Or something  Like a Broadway move  And he just  Blasted him  Broadway move  That was one of the highlights  But you know what  These fans  They should be fucking arrested  No reason to be thrown  Well they're saying that  I mean they're saying  That some fans  Will be arrested as well  It's not just the players  That are going to face  Criminal charges 
[01:36:30]  Absolutely  And one more thing  No reason why  Catholic school girls  Should be walking  To school in the morning  My god  Oh my god  They look so good  In their uniforms  I'll say they do  It really is amazing  I don't understand  Why they haven't done away  With that uniform thing  Yeah they make slack  Sometimes  A slack set  It's so sick to see  Every morning  You're right Anthony  I need Jimmy Norton  As my co-pilot  Just pulling out his mule  Hello girls  Good morning  That's right  I'll get her in the car  You drive away  Alright Anthony  Thank you  Punch it out  Alright can we fast forward 
[01:37:00]  Back to the show Anthony  Ah yes  Here we go  No you're supposed to do the  I can't do the fast forward  I can do the backwards  I don't know what that means  Play it forward  And see if it meant anything  It might  Yeah this guy  Chai Vang  Opened fire  On a group of hunters  That  Because he was in their tree stand  And they told him  To get out 
[01:37:30]  And there's a problem  With Laotians  There's  Vang 36 of St. Paul  Is a  Hmong  A Hmong?  H-M-O-N-G  Which is a Laotian tribe  That was driven  In  Exile  Driven into exile  For helping U.S. forces  Hunt communist guerrillas  During the Vietnam War  So this guy  36  So he had no involvement 
[01:38:00]  In the Vietnam War  You can't even give him that  Like as an excuse  That's 36 years old  How old was he?  He might have watched his mommy and daddy  Burn in one of those villages  You think?  Maybe  So he's in the tree stand  And they have a problem  Because these  These Hmong Laotians  That are up there  Have no concept of private property  They don't understand it  Hey there you go  There's a video game on TV  Now that we're bouncing all over the place  They just showed  Kennedy and the crosshairs  They have no concept of  Private property 
[01:38:30]  So this guy  And the other Vietnamese  Laotians there  That are hunting  Get into these problems all the time  But this guy decided  He was going to open up  With his SKS  7.62 millimeter  Hey look at that  And killed six people  Unbelievable  What was his name?  Chai Vang  Why are you laughing?  I was trying to think  Of some kind of a full metal jacket  His rice allowed in the barracks 
[01:39:00]  You didn't have it though  Did you?  Nope  And he just  He got off the deer stand  Started walking away  And then  Just turned around  And started shooting at  All the people  What a sick ass  Well they said  They knew he was crazy  When he said  The private's weapons name  Is Shareen sir  There it is  You got your line in  There you have it  Alright  Let's go to the phone  And say hi to Dan  In New York  What's up Dan?  Hey  Hey  Dan 
[01:39:30]  Who's this?  Obi?  Yeah  You're on the radio  Oh no shit  I wanted to correct Anthony  From yesterday  Because he said  No  The army  Shot Kennedy  From  From the book depository  Yeah  Isn't it the book depository?  You  Idiot  You  You do not deserve 
[01:40:00]  To listen to this  Fine program  On a daily basis  If you do not understand  Why  We need all the listeners  We said book suppository  Don't piss him off  We need all the listeners  We can get  Well he needs to be educated  But why is everyone  Correcting us  On a daily basis  At this point  Of course I said  Book suppository building  Knock it off  And didn't you hear Jim say  Knock it off after  Yeah  Did you ever  Ever see  Full Metal Jacket  It's required  Viewing 
[01:40:30]  If you're listening  To this program  There are certain movies  That are required  Viewing  For this program  You cannot pass  This class  Unless you see the movie  It makes the show  That much more funny  Wow  Wow  I've been driving  For 23 hours  So I'm trying to fuck  You know  Alright  It's okay  We forgive you  It's alright  You can keep listening  Alright  Alright  There he goes  Let's say hi to Ray in Jersey  Hey Ray  Hey Ray  What you guys felt to mention  Was that half of these monkeys 
[01:41:00]  80% in fact  Have felonies  Any other job  These fuckers would never get the job  Where are you getting your stats from  80% of the NBA have felonies  It's NBA  It says it on the screen  It was on Fox News yesterday  Wait  80% of the NBA  80%  Yeah  And a lot more  Have kids out of wedlock  They're all ghetto  And if you got rid of basketball  Half of these monkeys  Will be back in prison  Wow  Look at you  Dude  I swear to God  We don't need the  We don't need the racial epithets sir 
[01:41:30]  Forget the racial thing  Listen  I question your stats though  80% of the NBA has felonies  I didn't make this shit up  Someone show me that stat  He said he heard it on Fox News  So it's got to be right  If it's Fox News  Was it a news alert?  And you know what the biggest bullshit is  You're afraid to say it  Because there's so impressive  These idiots throwing a fucking ball through a hoop  I've seen that shit being done by a fucking dolphin  You know what  It's all fine and good  You're comparing  Someone that plays in the NBA 
[01:42:00]  With a dolphin in Florida  Wait  Had it a dolphin  I thought I heard him say dolphin  He's basically saying that  There's no skill involved  Playing in the NBA  It's okay  You just lower the volume  You can talk volume down  He's trying to say  I was listening  And then I wasn't listening  And then I heard him say dolphin  That's no big deal to play in the NBA  Because he's seen the same shit with dolphins  Oh like at SeaWorld  They hit the ball with their bobble nose  And knock it into a hoop  Dude your argument  No I have seen that  Your argument is awful  I have seen that though Opie 
[01:42:30]  I was with you for a while  Are you trying to say  If we got a team of dolphins  They could take on an NBA team and win  No what I'm saying is  They could do the same god damn job  Throw a fucking ball through a hoop  How much  How much is wrong  If a guy goes into his bag  Get the 9mm  And start shooting at the fucking crowd  And then they'll blame Black Rage  It's all bullshit  I really want to go with this dolphin thing  I like the dolphin thing  You think a team of dolphins  Could beat like  Let's say the New York Knicks  With the New York Knicks  Yeah we'll tattoo them up  Yeah  Fine you know what 
[01:43:00]  Joke all you want  Yes sir that's what we do  On a comedy radio program  We joke all we want  No you're absolutely right  But you know what  Not too far from now  Some idiot's gonna grab a gun  And start shooting into the crowd  And then he's gonna blame Black Rage  Who cares  How great would that be  To see somebody get shot  At a sporting event  Oh they play that over and over  Sir  You're making something racial  Out of the fact that  It just got ugly  Between fans and players  There's nothing racial about it  It happens in all sports  Hockey dude  Dude  Hockey they fight all the time 
[01:43:30]  Right  They fight fans in hockey  It happens with sports  And you know what  Your argument stinks  Because if you watch the video  There was black players  Punching black fans  Yeah dude  It's just a sporting event thing  Dude that's how they mate in the ghetto  What are you out of your fucking mind  How they mate in the ghetto  Wow  That's completely insane  You're actually  You're looking  You're looking to make something  That isn't there  I know what you're saying  You're looking  You go back to the 50's  When most of the players are white  And look at how  Look at how 
[01:44:00]  And you know what  The game was boring  It sucked  They shot their foul shots  Underhanded  They did the two  The two handed set shot  Oh that cute little hook shot  Layup  The layup  Who cares  Like human beings  And sir  Even how about  Baseball was more peaceful back then  And so was hockey  They didn't fight quite as  So every sport has gotten  Progressively more violent  As steroids  And people get bigger  And more aggressive  I'm telling you  Okay so you just made my point  In hockey to all sports  It's not a black thing  Is what he's saying 
[01:44:30]  Yeah you know why  It's a black thing with basketball  You know why  Because if you look at  If you look at their status  And where they are  They would never get another job  With their criminal record  Dude you don't have that many fights  In basketball compared to other sports  Yeah it's very rare  It's not disproportionately  Violent in basketball  It's very rare  Hockey has more fights in a week  Than basketball has in a season  Baseball has  Baseball has  I think baseball has  More fights than basketball  Baseball has a lot of fights  Yeah  And they're not black 
[01:45:00]  All Dominicans  You guys  You know what  Apparently  Apparently you guys  Are afraid to say something  Yeah we're terrified  Obviously  Obviously  We just don't  Dude we don't  I don't agree with you  No no no  We're not afraid  We're speaking the truth  I disagree with you  I guarantee your stats are wrong  80% of the NBA  Has felonies  You're saying  And you're saying  And you did not see the video  Where they were punching  Black fans right  No no  Here's what you do  Forget about what I said 
[01:45:30]  I mean  You're always on the internet  Look it up  It's that easy  Look it up  And then punch yourself  In the face with it  Alright thank you  What else do I have to tell you  Thank you Ray  Punch yourself  Where's Ray from  Jersey  Alright  Take the shit off your head dude  I thought that was like  A call from Kentucky  But it's right down the road  In Jersey here  You can't find racist stuff like that  It doesn't exist man  It's stupid  You gotta watch out  For these cheggers  I thought he was kind of  On the money  Because the Dolphins would win  The Blacks don't swim  Oh there you go 
[01:46:00]  If you put them all  In a pool  Alright  Well we're gonna go with this  For the rest of the morning  So if the game is played in water  I guess that would be  An advantage to the Dolphins  Advantage Dolphins  Especially if they have to play  With water that would be  Over their heads  That's right  Yeah  It would be tough to keep  Above ground  Now how high do you make the net  The basket's gotta beware  Because I've seen Dolphins  Get right up on their tails  And do that  Thing where they dance  On their tail  But a guy 
[01:46:30]  You would have to put the hoop  A little lower  Because he couldn't get  His shoulders out of the water  Good point  You know this opens up  A whole big thing  The Dolphin against human  Basketball game  But you play the game  On an NBA court  Now humans  Definitely have the advantage  They're just gonna be  Flopping there on the court  Getting nothing done  I don't think they can play  Gasping for after a while  They'd be in those little  Stretcher like things  With people pouring water  Over them  Sure  To keep them moist  Keep them moist 
[01:47:00]  And they couldn't really  Score I don't think  I don't think so either  Advantage human  I would say there  You might be able to  Lay one by the foul line  And have them like  Flip a ball up into there  So  But  I guess we have to find  A playing surface  That would be fair for both  Maybe it's  Maybe it's water  But there's only about  Five feet of water  Very shallow water  So now  So the Dolphin could still swim  I think you're onto something  Dolphin could swim  Because they could get up  High out of the water still  Right  If you notice  The Dolphins are pretty much  Almost completely out of the water 
[01:47:30]  And then you got the NBA players  They got a good two feet  Out of the water themselves  It would cut down on  I don't think they'd be able  To jump as high  But then the Dolphin  Couldn't get as high  Out of the water  People can't jump  In  Let's realistically say  You need a good  You need a good  Three feet of water  At least  To keep a Dolphin alive  Okay  Three feet of water  Now try to jump  Out of three feet of water  And maybe  You know  Stuff a basket  Are there flaming hoops involved  We could light them on fire  I don't see why 
[01:48:00]  Just to make it interesting  Everyone's going to get  Stopped for traveling though  Because you can't dribble  In three feet of water  How are you going to do  Very good  But Jim  We weren't even thinking of that  And for the flaming hoop  We'll just lay some  Of Steve C's shirts  On the water  That way it's safe  But still looks like  It's on fire  How do you dribble  In water  How do you dribble  In water  Dolphins can't dribble  They don't have fingers  There's another problem  They can't dribble  With their little flippers  Like this  So I guess you've got to  Take the dribbling 
[01:48:30]  Out of the game  That changes the entire game  It's not basketball  It's not basketball  No  No  So we'll have them  Play football  Is that possible  I don't know  British version  What a ridiculous idea  Jeff in Kentucky  Hey Jeff  Hey what's going on  What's up  The comment I wanted to make  Is  You know  Well first  The first comment  Is you want to  Agree with that  Last caller  From Jersey  Because you're  From Kentucky  It comes with the territory  Yes 
[01:49:00]  Go ahead  We'll get that  Out of the way  It makes me want to  Say like yesterday  Needless to say  Needless to say  Needless to say  Exactly  But anyway  You know  Stuff like this  Is going to happen  When you're serving  Alcohol at sporting events  I'm not against  Serving alcohol  At sporting events  But you know  When you've got fans  In the audience  And they're drinking  People are a little  You know  Buzzed up and stuff  You know  People's perceptions  Get blurred  And stuff like this  Happens  Dude they've been  Drinking at sporting events  Ever since Babe Ruth  Was playing  Alright  And there was a time 
[01:49:30]  They didn't cut off  The beer sales  In the seventh inning  Which by the way  Is a joke  That's the alcohol  Companies like  You know  Playing ball  Playing ball  With the sports leagues  And look  By the way  Look overseas  Look what they do  When they play soccer  In every country  In the world  These savages riot  I don't care  If they're from  Paraguay or England  Every soccer fan  Is always riot  Fucking soccer hooligans  Yeah  Right  And I'm not saying  Out  You know  Even the commissioner  Said you know  We're going to have 
[01:50:00]  To look in the outlaw  Maybe beer sales  And this and that  Oh yeah  You go tell Budweiser  Right  Now we're going to  Solve the problem  By taking alcohol  Out of the  One inch  Out of the fans  Hands  That'll never happen  It's ridiculous  That's right  And it's such a joke  That they do cut off  The beer sales  After the seventh inning  Because everyone  Can sober up  In two innings  Yeah  What a joke  That's when you buy  A bunch of beers  And take them back  To your seat  Of course  It forces you  To binge drink  Because you're like  Oh my god 
[01:50:30]  We're running out of time  Harry go get  Eight beers for us  Not only should they  Not stop serving alcohol  But after the eighth inning  They should hand out  Batteries to people  In outfield  Especially if you live  In Philly  I'm not saying  They should stop serving it  Because you're right  If they stop serving  Alcohol at sporting events  I mean attendance  Would drop off big time  No it wouldn't  People would still go  They'd just sneak  Their own booze in  They'd bring in vodka  And drink it in soda  Like concerts  Alright  You rock little Jimmy  Oh thanks guy  Thank you Jeff  Later  Alright there he goes 
[01:51:00]  Jeff  Kevin in Virginia Beach  What's up Kevin  What's up ONA  Hey  Hey  I just wanted  That one guy  With the 80%  NBA criminals  Whatever  That the guy  There was a guy  An author  That did a book  About that  That actually verifies  All that fact  Well  I don't know his name  It's out of bounds  By Jeff Benedict  Yeah  Is what we're getting  And some guy  Posted like  A transcript  From an interview  I guess with Bill Hemmer  Who was on CNN  And not Fox News 
[01:51:30]  Saying 40%  Have a record  And then Hemmer says  What do you define  As a serious crime  And then Benedict  Said serious crimes  Would be felonies  Or misdemeanor crimes  Involving violence  Weapons  Substance abuse  Or theft  So some of those  Are misdemeanors  Some are misdemeanors  Who doesn't have  One of those  40%  80% are felonies  Jesus dude  Yeah going from  80% felonies  To 40%  Just some type  Of record  There's a big difference  That's a lot of people  That is really 
[01:52:00]  A lot of people  40%  Some kind of record  Dude  Yeah but that's like  You know  What  Getting caught  For smashing mailboxes  You get a record  Yeah knocking over  Mailboxes  Driving through  People's backyards  Got a girl in the car  That's a man  Tom in Boston  Hey what's going on  Hey  Actually I was going  To go back  To the  Hunter thing  Do we have to go  Backwards in the show

[01:54:30]  This guy bitching  And moaning about  Basketball being violent  You know  It's just ridiculous  You wonder why animals  Eat their young  And then you talk  To someone like Ray  Yeah Ray was a little  Out there with his facts  Yeah I think  I wish Ray was here  I'd give him a kiss  Right on the neck  Hey who doesn't like  Being racist  But you gotta be accurate  Yeah it's fun to be racist  If you have facts  You know it's the racists  That just blurt out  Bullshit  That ruins it  For the racists  That really want to  Base it on facts  Absolutely  And the racists

[01:55:30]  Chinese assault rifle  It's a legal gun  For hunting  Yeah  It's a fucking  Assault rifle  It's a semi-automatic  It's a rifle  You're a silly man  Everyone knows  You need an assault rifle  To shoot deer  That's it  We figured that out  A while ago  Yeah  But I think  It's fucked up  Yeah  The guy obviously  It was a little overkill  On the ammo  Tell you the truth  If you can't hunt deer  With a bolt action  Single shot rifle  You shouldn't be out there  You know 
[01:56:00]  You should be able  To just take him out  One shot  Not  This guy had  What  20  I think maybe  40  Rounds  That's crazy  Insane  What do you need that for  Mike  He's back in Laos  Mike from PA  We gotta go back  To the Dolphins  Playing the NBA players  In a game of hoops  So we got more calls  On this Anthony  Let's say hi  To Mike and PA  Hey how you guys doing  Hey  Am I actually on the air  Yeah  Wow  Hey uh 
[01:56:30]  I was thinking  Yeah isn't it a thrill  Isn't this gonna just  Make your day  Can't believe it  Can you  You're talking to  O.P. Anthony  And Jim Norton  Oh my god  I gotta jerk off  Jim Norton  Makes me nervous  Why fella  You guys make my day  Every day  I drive a lot  Stop kissing our ass  Yeah  Alright man  That's two bucks  You know  Hey uh  Wow you're really nervous  I love it  He's all over the place  A little flustered 
[01:57:00]  Hi  Hi  Oh my god  Stop Jimmy  Hi  Trust me  Trust me dude  It's not a treat  It's really  Just awful  We really are  A room full of zilches  Just relax  You should see  When 10 o'clock hits  We just  We're just awful  Yeah  Yeah 10 o'clock  Well that thing  I was  Yeah  Yeah  Stop Jimmy  Alright go ahead Mike  Alright well  I think the guy  With the Dolphins thing  I think he was talking  About the Miami Dolphins  Oh do we have to 
[01:57:30]  Throw that in the equation  I'm pretty sure  Now how are the Miami Dolphins  Going to play the NBA players  In a game of hoops  With all that equipment on  Now we don't need water though  That makes it easier  For everybody  If you had to go 100 yards  Just to score a basket  Everyone would be tired  How about that  Put a basket  At the end of a  Each  At the end of a football field  There you have it  I got a solution  For the basketball thing too  Alright  You can have  Different little pools  Of water  With each dolphin in it  You can have  Five dolphins  On the court  And they can just 
[01:58:00]  Pass it back and forth  Oh in certain areas  And then the humans  Have to stay on the wood  Exactly  In between the pools  That the dolphins are in  But how are you going to  Play man to man defense  You can't  It's not man to man  Anyway  That's true  Well the zone  The zone is illegal  In the NBA though  That seems like  More of a zone thing  Happening  And all you have to do  Is throw a little toaster  Into the pool  And there goes  The end of that dolphin  It's a very bad solution  So what about rebounds  If it doesn't go in the pool  You know you're kind of  Taking the dolphin out of it  But I guess if the rebound  Goes in the pool 
[01:58:30]  You kind of take the guy  Out of the mix  Or what if you go  To make a jump shot  And you land on the dolphin  Squishy back  And your toe gets stuck  In the blowhole  Where God forbid  Your shorts fall off  And your rod  Goes into his blowhole  That's a lucky NBA player  Alright thanks Mike  From PA  Let's go to Leroy  In Alabama  Get that problem  Worked out  Dolphins against human  We're working on it  Alright  Leroy  Hi gentlemen  How are you doing  I believe we have  An opening in our  Organization  For that boy  Named Roy  Roy in Jersey 
[01:59:00]  Where would your  Organization be  Well it's kind of  A secret organization  We run around  You know  In white sheets  With pointed hats  We put burning crosses  On people's yards  Matter of fact  Didn't y'all mention  That yesterday  In Long Island  Yeah we had a  Cross burning  On Long Island  Over the weekend  And we were just  Comparing it to the  Old days where you guys  And I'm sure you're  Really one of these guys  Would spend days 
[01:59:30]  Building those big  Huge 10 foot crosses  To really make a  Statement  It was a big rally  And the people  That you were  Doing it on their  Front lawn  Would have to  Just look out their  Windows as you're  Doing it  They'd bring you  Lemonade  Right  They'd probably  Bring you lemonade  Never  Never  Never I say  Because the Ku Klux  Klan is here  To stay  I believe he would  Be a great  Thing to have him  In our organization  And we could give  Him a pair of  Jack boots  Or a pair of  Kennish shoes  With swastikas  On them would be  You know his choice 
[02:00:00]  Very good  But anyhow  I just thought  I'd mention that  Alright  Thank you Leroy  I like the fact  I'm so glad  We were able to do  Obvious humor  On our radio  I like the fact  That Leroy was  Talking trying to  Think of something  Like to wrap it up  As he's going  Yeah  Sometimes you're  Just talking  You realize  Well I can't  Just pause  They're gonna  Hang up on me  So keep talking  And something  Funny will show  I keep talking  But I ain't got  Nothing  Alright we're  Gonna take a break  We got Tippy Tom  Outside the studio  We'll bring him in  For another session  I think we have  Another homeless guy

I said this looks like a job for me,  so everybody just follow me,  because we need a little controversy,  because it feels so empty without me.  Everyone is ordering their smoothies.  It's smoothie time!  It's smoothie time!  Yay! 
[02:09:30]  You guys discovered smoothies yesterday,  and you can't get enough of them.  No.  He might not be changed.  He hit the fangles on it.  All right, Anthony, on the instant feedback.  Oh, wait a minute, Opie.  Yes.  Is there a controversy here with the smoothie?  What happened?  What's the matter?  I want my change, but I don't think he owes me.  I think I only gave him three bucks before.  Oh, I thought he didn't know the proper place to go or something.  No, no, I'm sure he'll go to a right age.  You're accusing the interns of stealing your money, Jim?  No, Nathaniel, I think, owes me change.  I don't know where he is.  How much money did he give the kid?  I don't know where that...  He makes no money to run around for you all morning.  Yeah, well, give him a tip. 
[02:10:00]  I'll inspect the gadget face to come back in here and give me my change.  How much did you give him?  I'll give his bag a little tickle.  Oh, my...  Why are you bitching about some change?  How much change do you owe him?  I...  This guy runs around for you like crazy every morning.  It's very nice of him, too, but I was going to give him...  Catch a little cereal, and whatever you need,  he runs and gets.  Thank you.  You're the only one that needs more coffee, more this, more that.  I don't believe I owe you anything, Jim.  Okay.  I split up...  I owe you nothing!  You gave me money for both coffee and food earlier, 
[02:10:30]  and I split it up with Mike.  A coffee and food?  Yes.  And Rolaids.  Okay.  Oh, and Rolaids, too.  I'm sorry.  Over here.  Thank you.  I didn't say he stole it.  You have it for here?  All right.  Oh, Nathaniel.  Jimmy Norton.  Oh, one.  Looks like four.  All right.  Yeah, you're the worst, dude.  I'm not the worst!  What do you want?  75 cents back from our intern?  No, no, no.  I thought I gave him, like, 10 bucks for coffee.  I thought I gave him $10, but it turned out he owes me 75 cents. 
[02:11:00]  I'll be living where I live now.  I live in a predominantly Jewish area.  We know.  We know.  I can tell from the sideburns you're growing.  Smoothie, please.  Smoothies!  Smoothie, please.  I want the same one as Lil Jimmy.  We're getting...  I want a large apple.  You know how pathetic you have become?  Orange and banana.  It used to be Budweiser, please.  Budweiser, please.  Another shot of Jack, please.  Another shot of Jägermeister.  Right.  I wouldn't even say please.  Where's my fucking beer?  Give me my fucking beer.  Now you're getting smoothies. 
[02:11:30]  I'm set with the smoothies today.  Thank you.  You can get me a banana, though.  I need a little more nutrition.  I'll tell you.  Jimmy, can you buy me a banana, or is that going to put you out?  No, it won't.  A large...  I just want a large...  A large banana and orange smoothie.  Yes.  I would like a receipt and my change.  You are the worst.  Very good.  I will have the same.  Living where I live now, Opie, predominantly Jewish neighborhood,  it takes me an extra ten minutes in the Rite Aid, 
[02:12:00]  because at the register, there's always a problem.  The Jewish people just cannot bust apart those stereotypes, can they?  There's a woman that was in front of me the other day.  I'm there to pick up something, some sodas or something.  And I wait online, and the woman in front of me is arguing about, dude, a nickel,  arguing that the price said with the coupon that she was supposed to have a nickel off. 
[02:12:30]  The woman behind the counter is telling her that the nickel was taken off already,  and this woman, no, no.  It's supposed to be five cents cheaper than you're ringing it up to be.  I want to speak to a manager.  I want to speak to a manager.  I'm back there holding a nickel like I could wail it at her head as hard as I can.  Oh, I've done that before.  Here's your fucking nickel, baby.  I will put the change on the counter.  Like, look, here's the difference.  They don't care.  Just get the hell out.  They don't care, because it's all about the principle of it. 
[02:13:00]  So they can go home to their miserable husbands and nag and rag about how they were abused and almost taken.  Honey, you're not going to believe what happened to me today.  And some woman at the counter said that my nickel, you just want to grab them and pound their face into the counter.  Here's the question I asked today.  These old bags that you see in the drugstores and stuff, they used to be hot pieces of asses.  When?  They had to be at one point.  You see all the hot pieces of asses walking around New York on a daily basis?  Yeah, but I guess. 
[02:13:30]  A lot of those people are going to end up being old bags doing exactly what you're saying.  So when does it change?  When does it change from doing some of that fine effing to you're arguing over nickel in a stupid drugstore?  I think marriage and kids have a lot to do with it.  I think that has a lot to do with it.  Yep.  And also, you don't want to see the groovy old broad anymore.  It's awful.  I don't want to see that.  Heck your age.  Yeah, so I'm trying to be young and hip.  You smell like old person.  Look at Keith getting prepared to wake up Tippi Tom.  This is going to get really ugly. 
[02:14:00]  He's got the gloves on that are reserved for the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  If I remember correctly, he's a nasty, nasty fucker when he gets up.  Oh, when you wake up?  We had him on the bus going out to Long Island.  Right.  He was real nasty.  On the answer to feedback, Silver Surfer from New York.  Can you stick to one story at a time, guys?  A trucker just told me some Asians shot six dolphins at a Pistons game.  That's funny.  No, that was golfers.  And then Littlefoot from CringeHumor.net.  We love CringeHumor.net.  But Lyndon McCartney, Donald Trump, Tippi Tom, and Anthony's mom should make a barbershop quartet. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, that would sound good.  We've never played Anthony's mom singing on the new show, and I happen to have it, Anthony.  Ah!  Hence me reading that instant feedback so I could turn over here and play this.  Well, you know, Opie, I have a very musical family.  My sister, my brother, me, we all sing.  My brother plays great guitar.  That means one thing.  Yeah.  Your dad was a hell of a singer.  That's exactly what I was getting to. 
[02:15:00]  My father, obviously the musical talent.  The Frank Sinatra of the family.  Because my mother is just an abomination when it comes to singing.  And she'll never sing when she's sober.  It's always at one of these parties that we have.  She's tipped back a couple of spritzers or something.  Woo-hoo!  A couple of my sister's margaritas.  I was at the family party this summer, and it's so funny.  Everyone just whispering and talking like, I can't wait until Aunt's mom sings Mercedes Benz. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  She's known for it now.  Yeah.  But she feels, I guess, she has to drink as much as Janis Joplin drank in her life before she's able to belt it out.  What are you handing me?  You just took me out of the pit.  Oh, boy, Eric.  Oh, boy.  Get on mic.  What are you handing me?  That was the generic remix of Anthony's mom.  And what is that?  That's the raw audio of Anthony's mom.  Ah.  And what's the remix?  The Drew Boogie one.  Drew Boogie remixed her into a song? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, all right.  We'll have to play both now.  Thanks.  And what were you saying?  Because I...  Oh, I don't know.  Eric took me right out of the mix.  Look at him.  He's all apologetic.  He's so eager to please.  I love him.  He's very good.  He is very good.  Almost.  We love Eric on this show.  I'm ready to pull out the book.  Good looking kid, too.  He's got that nice spruced up hair.  I like him.  Spruced up.  He got rid of the dye job.  I know.  I like it.  He got rid of the frosted look.  I didn't mean that in a gay way.  I mean, I know trying to get the gay out, but I just told him, like, I like you natural. 
[02:16:30]  All right.  Well, I think you were talking about your mom singing.  Mom singing.  She doesn't sing when she's so...  No, it's either karaoke, because sometimes at these parties we have karaoke, or they're  big parties, you know, or a band will be playing.  What I love about Anthony's family parties, and I'm not lying, they have guys that walk  the perimeter.  I don't know why.  The guy was just walking, taking a walk.  Oh, really?  Over and over again?  This guy liked to walk.  And then one guy was dancing, and he goes, hey, what are you, a dance judge?  Go, do your job. 
[02:17:00]  More wine!  And your mom lives in a really, really...  You were cooking in the kitchen.  You put in some sausage, a little sugar.  Your mom lives in a really nice retirement community.  It's not a retirement community.  It's like, it's one of those out on Long Island, you get the housing developments.  Right.  Well, there's some retirees there, because a bunch of them were at the party.  They're still hip and young.  There's kids, too.  Young at heart.  There's kids, too.  It's not like a retirement community.  It's just a housing community. 
[02:17:30]  I'm just wondering what the blue-haired one that lives next to your mom is going to do.  Oh, well.  That you have a guy walking the perimeter.  He was just taking a walk.  Yeah, sure he was.  Walking around the house.  Sure he was.  Oh, yeah.  Just walking.  That's what they do.  All right, so we've got to play your mom singing here.  All right.  Your brother recorded her at one of these parties, right?  She loves Janice Joplin.  Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz? 
[02:18:00]  My friends all drive Porsches.  I'm a snake and dance.  Work hard all my life with no help from my friends.  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  Turn it off.  Shut up!  Turn it off!  I'm a snake and dance.  You can just...  Turn it off.  Oh, Lord. 
[02:18:30]  dIsss jake.  dIsss jake.  dIsss jake.  dIsss jake.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:19:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Lord, won't you buy me  a Mercedes Benz?  My friends are all  drop pushes.  I must make demons.  Work hard  with no help  from my friends.  Oh, Lord.  Won't you buy me a Mercedes  Benz? 
[02:19:30]  That's it.  I forgot the f***ing words.  I like what I did.  I like it.  Shut up.  Holy smokes.  Don't you believe that sucks ass?  Potty mouth.  Oh, no doubt, man.  That is really, really funny.  She is a mess.  Oh, Lord!  Oh, Lord, why don't you shut my mother up?  God. 
[02:20:00]  I just want to hear what this remix thing is about.  I have no idea what  young Eric was talking about here.  Young Eric indeed.  Oh, Lord.  Won't you buy me  a Mercedes Benz?  My friends are all  drop pushes.  I must make a man.  Work hard all my life  with no help  from my friends.  Oh, Lord.  Won't you buy me 
[02:20:30]  a Mercedes Benz?  Shoot him now!  Not on your goddamn radio!  Oh, shut up!  Oh, this is retarded.  Oh, stop it!  Get in your mouth!  What the hell is going on?  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Hey, hey, hey!  Shut up!  Hey, hey, hey! 
[02:21:00]  Shut up!  Oh, Lord!  Oh, Lord!  Shut up, stupid!  Oh, Lord!  Goddamn, is that funny?  Not on your goddamn radio!  Oh, what a bitch!  Oh, mother and son of a bitch!  No!  Wow, I've never heard that before.  That's pretty cool.  That's Drew Boogie, right?  Yeah.  I like the way he positions me  saying rude things, too.  That's okay.  I was, too!  Yeah, but Sal's not gonna smash you. 
[02:21:30]  I made Sal caving my head in  with a rifle butt.  Sal can be scary when he needs to be.  Yeah, I wouldn't tangle with him.  He wants threaded us live on our radio show.  Ouch.  Did he?  It was awful.  For what?  Well, we don't go into it ever.  Unspoken things.  Yeah, yeah.  Really?  That's from the Forbidden Zone.  Mormon Jordan from D.C.  I guess commenting on my mom singing.  Anthony, who was your dad? 
[02:22:00]  Pavarotti?  Yeah.  Anthony, no disrespect, but my dogs are howling.  And it's death camp, not retirement community.  Wow!  You would be kept together when you get to the retirement community.  Found the papers.  Your possessions will meet you there.  I know you, you murderer!  There's been an injury!  Get a doctor!  This man is hurt! 
[02:22:30]  Good throat slashing.  Zell!  Oh, man.  And the guy that worked in the jewelry shop with him was the guy from Time to Make the Donuts commercial.  Oh!  He was the guy that worked with the guy that followed Olivia up the street.  Really?  Yep.  The Time to Make the Donuts guy.  He was in the jewelry shop.  Hey, Richie, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  That's great.  Going back to the Dolphins, right? 
[02:23:00]  Oh, all right.  You know, they can't breathe out of water, you know?  Nope.  No, we do know that.  Oh, okay.  So what did you say that they couldn't?  Because even out of the water, they can still beat the nicks, right?  Yeah, but they can't move.  Yeah, but they can still beat the nicks no matter what they do.  And how long can they breathe out of water?  They can breathe out of water for a long time.  It's not the breathing.  It's that their skin gets dried out.  Yep.  So when they transport them, you gotta wet them down.  I do believe I said that they can't breathe out of water.  They can't breathe out of water. 
[02:23:30]  You're right.  I know they can breathe out of water.  My question is how long can they breathe out of water?  Good.  And if that will affect the outcome of the game.  Right.  They're just gonna hose them down for a while, like you said.  All right.  And like I said, they'll still beat the nicks, right?  Of course they will.  All right.  Thank you, man.  You guys suck, man.  Bye, fella.  I don't like the fact that he did that nicks joke four times.  Oh, I know.  Four times.  Did you still beat the nicks?  Nothing.  They could beat the nickerbockers.  No?  All right.  Anything?  They could best the Nets rivals.  No. 
[02:24:00]  No.  Anything?  No.  They could beat the non-hockey team in the garden.  Yeah.  If they played hockey, they'd be a problem because there'd be a lot of frozen dolphins.  Yeah, they'd probably die.  Half out of the water, you know?  Oh.  Right.  Frozen in midair with their tails stuck to the ice.  Making that little noise and pain hurting while we laugh.  Army, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  Yes?  Did your mom tour with Paul McCartney and Wings?  No, my mother was not Linda McCartney.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  I'm really glad I didn't say that. 
[02:24:30]  Some of these jokes you could just keep in your head, you know?  Everyone, they do those jokes in their heads as we play this game called the Opie and Anthony  Radio Show.  Dude, I almost fired out a reference to Linda McCartney, too, and I'm really glad I didn't  because that would have been very embarrassing.  Are you guys ready to wake up Tippy Tom?  Where's the broads?  Oh, boy.  Well, I don't know where the broads are.  Ben, what's going on?  Nothing works the right way on this show.  Stuck in traffic.  I like how you tipped your fedora up when you said that.  Where are the broads?  Broads.  I'm just going to sleep for a while. 
[02:25:00]  Where's Keith?  Where's the holes with feet?  Keith.  Keith.  We have to make sure we do this right.  We got Tippy Tom outside the studio.  Wiggle those stems in here, dame.  No, Keith.  Come in here.  Hold on.  Keith!  Keith.  Hold up!  Holy shit, these fucking guys that work for us.  Sometimes they're just asleep.  Those silly geese.  Jesus.  What?  So how are you going to wake him up?  We want to set this thing up here.  You got your gloves on.  Yeah, we'll give him a little stir and see. 
[02:25:30]  Hopefully he hasn't pissed himself.  And you were telling us a little while ago that he gets really nasty when you wake him up?  Oh, yeah, he's nasty when you wake him up.  He's real nasty.  Eric is covering his nose with his shirt.  Right.  I guess it really stinks out there.  All right.  We got Steve who's filming all this for some videos that we'll get up on Opie and Anthony  dot com later today.  All right.  It's waking up a belligerent homeless guy.  Keep that over there.  The microphone.  He gets too close to me.  He's sitting on my side of the console.  Make sure that mic is up.  Make sure the mic works.  Test the mic.  Test the mic. 
[02:26:00]  Test the mic.  And how are they going to hear us?  Test the mic.  Test the mic.  The mic's on.  Okay, good.  How can they hear us?  No, but...  Do you have headphones on so you can hear us?  No.  No, of course not.  Why would they do that?  They're waking him up.  They're waking him up.  Tippy Tom.  Tommy.  Uh oh.  He might be dead.  Tommy.  No, he's not dead.  He could be.  Is he blue?  Tommy.  He looks a little blue.  He's not moving.  Oh my god.  Is he blue?  He's taking his pulse. 
[02:26:30]  Is he dead?  Oh my god.  No, I'm serious.  Oh my.  We could have a problem.  Uh oh.  Tippy Tom.  Oh my god.  Smack him in the head.  Alright.  His ears are...  No, no, no.  Don't smack him.  His ears are kinda red.  No, he's...  I think he's alive.  They can't wake him though.  Wow.  He...  This is it.  Does he have a pulse? 
[02:27:00]  Oh my god.  He's not waking up.  Anything you wanna hear?  No, don't...  Don't hit him.  Don't hit him.  You're just smacking him in the fire.  Anything you'd like to try, Master Poe?  He's dead.  Good timing.  He's waking up.  He's taking his pulse.  Does he have a pulse?  Yeah, does he have a pulse?  Does he have a pulse?  You guys really need headphones out there if we're gonna try to do a radio show.  Cause you don't know what we're saying.  Aw, I hope he didn't kill the homeless guy.  He's the only one we have.  Does he have a pulse?  I think...  Very, very faint pulse. 
[02:27:30]  Oh my god.  What's up, buddy?  Is he waking?  No.  Steve gotta move a little.  Steve.  How great would it be if he died on the radio show?  It wouldn't be great.  It would be awesome.  Oh, god.  What is he doing?  Master Poe.  Get a mic on Master Poe.  Master Poe.  You know, he's gotta be a deep sleeper.  He's just...  He's passed out.  Yeah, he's gotta be a deep sleeper if he's a homeless guy.  You gotta sleep through a lot.  Master Poe, what do you think? 
[02:28:00]  Is he alive?  Uh, yeah, he's alive.  If I give him a couple of pressure points, he may wake up.  But I don't want him to...  I don't want him to go to the bathroom on the floor.  Yeah.  He is breathing now.  Hold the mirror up in front of his mouth.  Yeah, he's breathing.  He's breathing, and he does have a pulse.  Oh, okay.  That's all you need.  If, um...  Alright, let's give the...  Oh, Steve's gonna, like...  Steve's touching with the...  What's he?  No, Steve's trying to snap...  Tip it down!  Oh, my God, we can't... 
[02:28:30]  It's in.  We cannot wake Tippy Tom.  Really, really yell at him.  Cold water.  Not in his ear where it'll damage anything, but, like, get right up to him and just yell,  Tom, wake up!  You know, just wake up, or...  There's another way to wake him up.  Tippy Tom!  Wake up, Tippy Tom!  Okay, that's not gonna work.  Wow.  Somebody yell...  Come on, Tippy!  Get up, boy!  Don't say...  Boy.  I like the red-headed lady out there who just can't believe this is happening in the studio.  Oh, I know.  She's disgusted.  He's disgusted.  Dude, he's not moving. 
[02:29:00]  At all.  Alright.  Holy S.  How are we gonna get him out of here?  Just leave him here.  Let them deal with him later.  Put him in the Frank's Place studio.  Alright, what's going on out there?  Someone's gotta tell us what's going on out there.  They're pouring water over his ear a little bit?  A little water.  Steve, get out of the way!  There we go.  Turn your head.  I know you gotta film it, but...  I kinda wanna see.  I'm so sorry.  Alright.  Keith, I need you.  What you gotta do is put your fingers in the water and then flick it onto his face. 
[02:29:30]  That'll do it?  No.  Please tell me the homeless guy's not dead.  I think he's dead.  Oh, there he goes.  Okay.  That kinda...  Did that get him a little bit?  Did that get...  That's how you...  Oh, he's stirring.  He's stirring.  Damn.  What's Poe doing?  Poe is brilliant.  He's...  Yeah, we got some poe.  He's alive!  He's alive!  Thank God!  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Can I knock you out?  You ready to do a little more singing? 
[02:30:00]  Gotta wake up, Timmy.  You ready?  Oh, my.  I thought he was dead.  Dude, I'm not kidding you.  I thought he was dead, too.  Steve.  There's a little water in the air.  Dude, did you all of a sudden have it going through your head, the news and everything?  Yes, of course.  All of a sudden, it was all going through my head, like, oh, my God, the news.  We're fired.  Wow.  Wake up!  Already starting to wake up.  You have to wake up.  Water on the eardrop.  All right, wake up now.  No, you know why?  Some people want to hear you.  Water on the eardrop?  I'm not kidding.  We and Frank Sinatra together.  I suck. 
[02:30:30]  I need my 15-minute rest.  15 minutes?  It's my business.  Not yours.  No, no, I know, Tippy, but we need you inside.  I don't bother you when you're resting.  It doesn't bother me.  Oh, my God.  Thank God.  He's alive.  Thank.  I can't believe we have to say this on our radio show.  Get the fuck out there and work and come back.  Back me up in 20 minutes.  Yeah, Tippy, Tom, drink this.  No.  Oh, God.  He say no to a drink.  Wow. 
[02:31:00]  He doesn't even want to drink.  No, I want rest now.  Be my friend and give me my 15-20 minutes.  All right, we'll give him 15 or 20 minutes.  No?  Yes, we should go make him sleep by that lady's desk, though.  Oh, God, no.  Right on the floor by her feet.  Tippy?  He's stinking up the place.  Yo, Tippy.  Come on, Tippy.  We have to wake up.  Not now.  I said 20 or 15 minutes.  I'm going to tell you about my boss.  He's going to be coming in about 15 minutes.  Just get the fuck out of here. 
[02:31:30]  Give him 15 minutes.  I don't sleep 15 more minutes if he wants.  I don't...  Give him my 20 minutes.  Now that we know how to wake him up.  Yeah.  He is seconds away from getting really nasty.  No, I didn't sleep too early.  Yeah, no, you were sleeping for two hours.  We need you inside, Tippy.  Go out.  Get out of here before I fucking...  I told you.  Go mad!  I told you.  I told you.  I'll bust somebody's head off his mother fucker.  Get the fuck out of here.  Hey, Tippy Tom. 
[02:32:00]  What's up, pal?  I already know you.  Get the fuck out of here.  You know what you mean though?  We've known each other a long time.  We're good friends.  Fuck you.  Give me my rest, man.  You want coffee?  No.  I'll leave.  That's what I'll happen.  And you want to see me.  Give me my 15, 20 minutes and get the fuck out of here.  Come on, pal.  We're going to go inside.  We're going to sing.  No!  I don't want to wake up now.  You're fucking with me.  Go get lost.  There's this guy here.  He wants to suck your cock. 
[02:32:30]  I asked him.  I don't care.  Nice blow job.  Get you going good in the morning.  Come on, pal.  Leave me 15, 20 minutes, please.  Right, man.  Fuck you, man.  Oh, gee.  They took his head off.  I want 15 fucking minutes.  You son of a bitch.  You scumbagged motherfuckers.  He's walking around now.  Fucking suck my dick.  Eat my asshole shit.  He's walking out.  Look at the face on her out there.  Look at that mug.  Do we want to keep him or do we want to let him go? 
[02:33:00]  Keep him.  We need to film her.  He's just wandering around the office and horrifying everyone else that works here.  You should see the mug on her.  Oh, I know.  Very angry.  Oh, she's not happy.  That's right.  Whew.  Eat my asshole, he said. 
[02:33:30]  Oof.  Jesus.  It's quite a meal.  You know, I'm telling you, a thick, viscous meal.  We tell the truth on this show as much as we possibly can.  I swear, my heart sank.  I really thought he was dead.  Oh, my God.  I thought he was dead, too.  Because they were raising his arms and his head and there was no...  He was not moving.  There was nothing.  And he kind of had a...  It's just falling.  Purple hue to him.  What's up, Ben?  Eric's on the phone.  They're talking to me.  He's on 12 there.  Oh, okay.  Is he near the elevator? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, no.  He's by the main door.  All right.  Eric, what's going on?  We ran out of microphone cord, but he's heading back, so we're going to throw him back on the mic.  All right.  Oh, here he is.  Keep away from my side.  All right.  He's coming in the studio.  He's got his fists up.  Hey, come on in here, Tippi.  What's up?  Tippi, what's going on out there?  Break me up.  I'm trying to get a little knack.  We need you inside, Tippi.  But you're here to perform, no?  I bust his ass.  I thought you wanted to sing another song. 
[02:34:30]  You want to fight?  Yeah, I'll fight you.  We're going to fight.  Hope he's getting up.  I'm not fighting him.  What kind of dope you want?  You want a bruised nose?  One of those gritty knuckles in your face?  Not even.  He'll just lick your mouth and nose.  End of fight.  All right, Tippi Tom, let's work this out.  What happened?  You're going to get your ass beat.  All right.  What happened out there?  Here's what's happening that's going on.  I have no idea what happened to you.  What's going on?  You're a deep sleeper, by the way.  I'm trying to get a little nap. 
[02:35:00]  Okay.  Because, you know, I'm...  A little tired.  A little sleepy.  A little tired from all the working you do.  Yeah, Tippi Tom, a little sleepy, you know what I'm saying?  And so I try to take a little nap.  Yeah.  And these motherfuckers over here give me a hard time.  Right.  So, what I got to do, I don't...  It's not, I don't love them, but what I'm saying is that I want to take my nap.  But you were napping for about two hours.  No.  Only about...  Yeah, you were. 
[02:35:30]  We watched you sleeping.  You were lying.  It was two hours.  It wasn't two hours.  You were lying.  You were lying.  It wasn't two hours.  I don't lie.  I had a nap for about half an hour.  It was two hours, Tippi Tom.  Well, Tippi Tom, he's unhappy.  And something I'm saying is this, is that I'm going to bust somebody's nose.  All right, bust his nose.  That guy is the problem right there.  I'm trying to get another half hour in. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Can we get a song before you go back to sleep?  Can we get another song before you go back to sleep?  A little lullaby, maybe.  Sing me a lullaby, please.  If I do one, I would.  Yes, you do.  Come on, the one you always sing.  Which one?  You always sing the lullaby?  Yeah.  Sing the lullaby.  All right.  Radio's patient, right?  Yeah.  Right on.  All right.  Here we go.  Fairy tales can come true. 
[02:36:30]  They can happen to you.  Obviously.  If you're young at heart.  Now, let me tell you that.  That's all you get.  That's all we get.  It's not matter.  Hey, we want to hear about the drag queen from last night.  It's hard to define the matter of the mind if you're young at heart. 
[02:37:00]  But if you should survive.  To a hundred and two or three?  Something like that.  Yeah.  If you are amongst the young at heart.  Give me your writing to that.  All right.  Now, I can't do it like him.  All right.  Can we, um, we want to know about the drag queen.  We want to know about the drag queen last night.  The drag queens?  All right.  Now, this drag queen.  You got a BJ from a drag queen, right?  Over on 4th East Street, right? 
[02:37:30]  Yep.  Yeah.  She come over to me, right?  Mm-hmm.  She says, hey, good looking.  What's cooking?  What the fuck you talking about?  My underwear.  She thought I was good looking.  Making stew.  And Timmy Thomas said, wait a second now.  I know you're good looking.  You're good looking too.  So what are we going to do about that?  And, um.  He's got to use Jay Moore's line. 
[02:38:00]  Right.  Yeah.  So we got.  Did you pull your pants down?  So we got two good looking people together.  And that queen.  Yeah.  Look pretty damn good yourself.  And so I got busy.  Where'd you go?  Behind the dumpster?  Well, we were going to do it behind the dumpster. 
[02:38:30]  I didn't know.  You're a little more romantic than that.  Let's do it.  Right on the sidewalk, man.  We're going to get busy.  So you pulled out your hog?  Right here.  And we make money.  Sounds like George Carlin, doesn't he?  Damn fucking right.  Bullshit.  No behind the dumpster.  So what happened?  You pulled out your hogs?  I'm not no cheap fuck.  I'm serious.  We are going to get busy.  Right there.  You motherfuckers. 
[02:39:00]  And that's what happened was this.  We did our thing.  I ain't going to go into details.  You pulled out the old pib squirt gun?  That's funny.  Can we see your stuff?  And then...  No, no, no.  Oh, B.  Don't even bang.  It's every time I'm on the radio now.  Can we see your stuff?  Shut up.  You guys shut up.  Yeah, let's see it.  I'm going to explain myself. 
[02:39:30]  After we got busy...  Yeah?  Yeah?  Busy?  I gave her a buck.  You gave her a buck?  Oh, a buck.  Alright.  Lots of money, you know what I mean?  She want to get on the train.  But she need a buck fifty.  I said a rack.  I'll get you more fifty cents.  So where'd you get her fifty cents from?  So I bumped fifty cents from my buddy. 
[02:40:00]  He gave me fifty cents so I get her on the train.  And we done gone fucking over there.  And so make sure she go home.  She said, hey Timmy time, why don't you come back to my house?  Oh.  I said, yeah.  I'll meet you later on.  And he motherfuckers rubbed me up over here.  And so I'm all fucked up.  So I got her on the train.  I bumped 50 cents with my buddy.  Give her my dollar.  And she gonna go up town. 
[02:40:30]  And that's what happened.  Alright.  That the buck happened.  And with that, why don't you...  So he's got one clean spot on his body.  All I got out of this whole fucking deal was a fucking blow job.  Alright.  And that was...  How about one more song and then you can go nap?  I can get the fuck out of here.  One more song and then you can go nap. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, think of a song.  And then we'll wake you up for the grand finale at the end of the show.  Yeah.  One more song.  Alright, you want Timmy time to belt one out?  Yeah, let's all belt one out.  Here we go.  Uh, uh, uh.  I like the dance moves.  Let me snap this one out.  Alright.  Everybody stand back.  Alright, stand back.  Clear the field.  Some bums are gonna do something singing.  Rock or roll or something a little different?  Um, I think we're enjoying the love songs or the nursery rhyme type things.  A little love song. 
[02:41:30]  Something tender.  Something tender, sure.  Alright, a little tender.  Yeah.  I left my heart in San Francisco.  Right next to the soap.  High on a hill.  It calls to me.  Little cable cars.  Ah, fuck.  I can't perform now.  No.  You're not getting no song.  No way.  He turns really quickly, doesn't he?  Temperamental little fella.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Get from me. 
[02:42:00]  He's like Sinatra.  Alright, he's leaving.  He's leaving.  Please make him talk to other people in the office.  Please make him talk to other people in the office.  Please.  She's a miserable out there.  Alright, I'll sing a song in a little while.  Alright, a little while he's gonna sing a cake and a nap.  There he goes.  Kiss my ass.  Tippi Tom don't wanna talk.  Alright, Tippi Tom doesn't wanna talk, Anthony.  Now give me a fucking horn.  Give me a what?  Who am I talking to?  A fucking horn.  Alright, look.  I'll tell you right now.  I'll tell you right now.  Tippi Tom don't feel good, I got tummy upset.  So when I'm saying it's this.  It's over, Johnny. 
[02:42:30]  Cause I love you.  What I'm saying is that is I love you and be well.  All right.  I will bust your ass if you give me a hard time, but I love you. 
[02:43:00]  Make him go to sleep.  The thing is, I love you.  I love you too.  Go to sleep.  I need a nap, all right?  And I'll come back and visit, all right?  All right.  Take a nap.  Please.  Good night.  About five minutes, and I'll come back.  All right.  We'll get Tippi Tom back in here in a little while.  Let's say hi to Jerry in Jersey.  Yes, Jerry?  All right.  I'm imagining his hot, stinky alcohol breath in my face, and I'm gagging over here. 
[02:43:30]  I know.  He just woke up.  He was sleeping.  I got to put a video up.  His morning breath.  Oh, yeah.  The videos will be up on opiananthony.com.  And I smell a promo.  Tippi Tom sings.  You got sweepers for me.  The love ballads.  Tippi Tom sings the love ballads.  All right, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Jerry.  I have a question for Master Paul.  What did you do to drop me?  You kids, outside the studio, no one can wake him up, and you just dripped a little bit  of water on his ear, and he was up.  Yes. 
[02:44:00]  Water was nice and cold, and it went down his ear and just woke him up.  Just like that.  All the slapping and hitting him with the microphone did nothing but a drop of water in his ear.  One drop of water.  One drop of cold water right in his ear canal, right?  Exactly.  Oh.  Went down his eardrum.  That wakes you up.  Yeah.  That'll wake you up.  All right.  I think my brother's on to something here.  He just handed me a note.  Have a homeless American Idol contest.  Ooh.  Geez.  Imagine getting...  Is there any other guys out there that sing?  Tippi Tom that sings like...  Well, Ziggy used to, but Ziggy's dead. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, Ziggy.  Rock and roll Tommy.  Rock and roll Tommy.  It's not a bad idea.  It's a great idea.  Ziggy's dead, baby.  Ziggy's dead.  We could give this to Keith.  Keith, you want to run with this?  Yeah.  Keith could be the Simon Cow of this bit.  I think I could think of a couple other...  A couple more singing homeless that we can come up with?  Singing homeless?  Sure, absolutely.  Oh, my God, they're spraying them down right now.  Yeah, they are.  All right.  Why don't we step aside, take a break?  Is there anything you want to hear going into break?  This is a great smoothie.  I'll say it is.  Again.  It's banana.  It's orange.

If you don't have time to load up your MP3 player with content, a company will do it for you.  The Audio Feast website downloads radio shows to your MP3 player. 
[02:48:30]  Tom Carhart told me more.  And we are creating what we call portable Internet radio.  We keep your portable MP3 players stuffed with content you love.  The service has over 300 different shows.  Some are an hour, some 60 seconds long.  There are news updates from the BBC and Associated Press as well.  If you want news, then you want it to be plugged in more frequently.  If you're just listening to music, maybe you only sync it once a month.  Or if you've got a wireless device, you never think about it anymore at all. 
[02:49:00]  It just, whenever it sees a network connection, it intelligently syncs.  The Audio Feast service doesn't work on all MP3 players.  In fact, the iPod isn't supported, which seems odd.  The service will cost you $3 to $6 a month.  For more, go to AudioFeast.com.  I'm L-A-Z-L-O-W.com, and that's what's on my underground hard drive.  It's the O&A virus.  XM 202.  XM news, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything, all the time.  Say fuck on this channel.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:49:30]  That's shocking.  Holy fuck, I need coffee.  This is the best show ever.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Everything you say to me.  What's that, what's that, what's that, what's that, what's that, what's that, what's that.  And I'm about to break.  I need another room to break.  Sex Bagel, where are you?  I'm in the bathroom down the hall here, and Tippi Tom is going pee-pee, as he's saying.  All right.  Tippi Tom is going pee-pee, as he's saying.  Here we go. 
[02:50:00]  He's in the bathroom.  How's it going in there, Tom?  Everything.  You know what's great?  It's just about 9 o'clock, so all the people that work on the hall are going to be getting in.  I'm working on it.  Give me about another minute.  Sex Bagel.  Well, of course you can.  But what I'm telling you is that let me get through this first.  What are you going to do to him if he comes in there? 
[02:50:30]  Well, I don't know.  I don't know what he's doing.  I think he's going to get his dick tough.  All right.  Jesus.  Jesus, man.  All right.  So they're in the bathroom.  You can't really understand that.  Right.  Right now, from Massachusetts.  Yeah.  Or BJ, for $1.50.  Wake him up and ask him where I can find this drag queen.  Yeah.  That's a bargain at any price.  I'll say it is.  That's got to be just awful.  Yeah.  Hey, Kentucky.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I've had the radio since the Wednesday that you guys started on the air. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  And I've listened to probably 75% of the shows all the way through some of them a few times.  And I love the show.  But this is by far the worst show I've ever listened to.  Okay.  It's funny.  You guys have a drunk or charted bastard in the studio.  That gets old after three, four minutes and maybe one song.  Maybe it's funny for you guys, but it's awful coming over the air, especially for new listeners. 
[02:51:30]  I don't think...  And we care why?  I don't think he understands the program yet.  You might not understand the program yet, Dave.  I've understood every show that I've heard so far.  It's not going to get much better than this.  And then you hit something that just doesn't appeal to you, I guess.  There you go.  That'll happen.  I guess everything happens.  That'll happen.  I think you got your $2 worth, though, this month so far, right?  That's all you should be worried about.  Hmm.  Did they do $2 worth of humor for me to keep this? 
[02:52:00]  $2.  Ah, sex bagel.  You never win?  Why didn't you even win?  What's a rim job?  That's when somebody suck on your asshole and lick your hiney.  And lick your hiney.  That's a rim job.  I don't think I've ever had that before.  All right.  Jesus.  Let the guy be. 
[02:52:30]  You get that from women or from men?  Both.  Both.  Huh?  And the cleanest thing.  Oh, my God.  I remember from the homeless shopping spree, he was so excited to use a clean bathroom.  Like, he was all excited to go into a bathroom.  You know, it was the same thing when we went to the mall, because they loved going in the  clean bathrooms.  Right.  What's going on with the women today?  No clue?  Steve said they're in the Midtown Tunnel.  Still?  They were in the Midtown Tunnel.  Where were they coming from?  Coming from Long Island.  That's the worst place to come in from.  I don't know.  How about a train? 
[02:53:00]  We have another Monster Rain song.  Anthony?  Another Monster Rain song.  Jesus.  This one's definitely worth playing.  It's from Fuel.  Fuel.  You might remember Fuel from the Most Offensive Song Contest.  Which one did Fuel do?  I don't know.  Offhand.  I remember, though.  Yeah.  Was his...  He might have done Baby Raper.  Was it?  Or was it Camp Concentration?  I'm not really sure.  Hmm.  We're going to break out Most Offensive Song Contest. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  Two.  See, we've seen people.  They want to send in their song parodies.  We didn't even ask for Monster Rain songs.  And people send them in.  Well, this one has a nice little twist to it.  Oh, it does?  Yeah, because they use Jimmy's Imaginary Friends in the song.  Baby Raper.  All right.  Relax.  That was one of the most offensive songs.  Hence the title of the contest.  It's an awful name for a song.  Oh, it's just an awful song.  So, Jimmy had Imaginary Friends growing up. 
[02:54:00]  Jimmy Robinson.  Yeah.  And Helen.  Yes.  Helen, the old woman.  Refresh our memories a little bit real fast.  Jimmy Robinson was the one that wore the cape.  No, look.  Helen.  These were my Imaginary Friends.  There was Jimmy Norton, which was me.  And there was Jimmy Robinson, who was actually me in a cape.  Yeah.  And me and Jimmy Robinson hated Jimmy Norton.  And then there was Helen.  She was probably in her...  I'm going to guess 37.  And she had a beehive frosted hairdo.  Those were my Imaginary Friends. 
[02:54:30]  Jimmy Robinson and Helen.  I love how you and Jimmy Robinson hated Jimmy Norton.  Oh, we hated him.  And Jimmy Robinson would ride a...  I almost, like me as I'm speaking, almost sat back and observed this like it was a TV show.  And I would talk to Jimmy Robinson because he had a cape on and would ride his tricycle with a cape.  But we just, we despised Jimmy Norton.  No psychological implications there, I'm sure.  No, not at all.  Pretty healthy for a boy.  And you liked Helen?  Yeah, I talked to Helen for years.  I don't know why.  I don't know where she came from.  She was just Helen. 
[02:55:00]  Helen.  My imaginary friend, Helen.  With the beehive hairdo, right?  Yeah, and I forgot about her for many years.  Was she nice to you?  Always?  Don't remember.  I can picture her face, though.  Was she frumpy?  No.  I wish I could think of who she looked like.  I just, she's like...  Picture any black and white photo of a woman from like 1965.  That's what I'm picturing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of like an over-the-shoulder look.  Like that.  You know, she wasn't bad-looking.  She wasn't great-looking.  Was she a mom type?  She reminded me a little...  If you guys remember...  You know Aunt Peg from the pornos?  From porn?  I didn't know Aunt Peg back then, but I can only think of an Aunt Peg type of face with 
[02:55:30]  a beehive, frosted hair.  I know.  I can picture exactly.  Yeah.  Well, Fuel has incorporated Jimmy Robinson into his song about Monster Rain, and I do  believe Helen as well.  Helen.  Helen.  And of course, Monster Rain was that little game you played with the other boys in the  neighborhood.  When it rained, you went under the porch and you kind of gave each other oral favors.  Yeah.  Why not?  Boys will all do that.  I like this one a lot.  It's Fuel.  Hanging out with Paul and Gene on Sunday afternoon 
[02:56:00]  And then they pushed me down the stairs  They sent me to comfort me, they tell me it's okay  They kissed my head and lost my hair  So here's to you, Jimmy Robinson  Come in with your cape and fly away  I'm so gay  I'm so gay  What's that you say, Jimmy Robinson  Helen wants to come over and play 
[02:56:30]  Monster Rain  Monster Rain  Hiding under porches with an ex-door neighbor's kid  I learned to live with all the awful things I did  Telling jokes so I don't have to kill myself 
[02:57:00]  So here's to you, Jimmy Robinson  I'm a sorry mess and you're too lame  I live in shame  Coo-coo-coo-choo, Jimmy Robinson  Why'd you have to make me play that game?  Monster Rain  Monster Rain  Hey, that's alright, huh? 
[02:57:30]  That's my new favorite song  That's Fuel  And Jimmy Robinson  My new favorite Monster Rain song  For all the people here on the show for the first time  This is a story that Jim told  And he incorporated very well into his song  Wow, had everyone in there  Had the whole kiss thing at the beginning too  Gene and Paul, and then they must my hair  Must your hair and tell you it's okay  After taking me down the steps  Wow, that was a good one  He brought Kiss in  Jimmy Robinson, Helen, yeah 
[02:58:00]  He had it all covered  And the cape  The cape  I'm a mess  And how you just tell jokes so you don't kill yourself  That was fantastic  Absolutely brilliant  Brilliant  My favorite song  And it sounded good  Yeah  It was done well  Well, it's Fuel  Yeah  Fuel knows how to do those songs  Alright  Is Tippy Tom okay?  Steve saw his underwear  He said it's green  Oh, God  Steve saw his underwear  Did he tape it?  Yeah  He's still in there 
[02:58:30]  He's excited  You don't have to clean the bathroom  Oh my God  He's wrecking the bathroom  Jim, what's up?  How are you guys?  What's going on, Jim?  Not much, Jim  How are you?  We're doing well today  Excellent  Is this the boat guy?  Yeah  Yeah, this is the boat guy  Yeah, this is the guy that got hit in the back of the head with a boat 15 years ago  He's 16  16 years ago, sorry  None of a problem  Someone was saying on instant feedback that one time you called in you said you were 31  And then another time you said you were 30 
[02:59:00]  I'm 30, I'll be 31 December 17  All right  And we're trying to get you laid for Christmas  I don't know where we're at with that  For some reason, nyconfidential.com doesn't want to call us back on this favor  Oh, come on  He picked out a hot chick and everything  He sure did  Elena, I do believe, right?  Yes  All is not lost  We'll hear from them  Really?  Yeah  You know, at the worst, I think we get Tippi Tom to give you some action  You don't have much eyesight, so you should be okay  Well, I don't know 
[02:59:30]  No  No?  Maybe, I don't know  I mean, I just want to get laid  All right, we're going to get you laid for Christmas, okay?  Come on, hook up old Bowie head  On my birthday on the 17th?

[03:01:30]  And then he sucked it out of his eyeball  He's telling that story  He's telling the story  And he fell asleep  God damn it  He didn't even get to the end of it  Now I'll never know what happened  He said, I was under the porch  And, oh, this is bad  How are we going to get him out of there?  I don't know  No one's going to want to go in there  Not our problem  No  Hey, by 10 o'clock  We're out of here anyway  Absolutely  We should just leave him there for the day  Bye-bye  Just leave him

What happened to a grand?  That's, we just jumped on a grand  Well, you jumped on a grand  We're wondering how low you would go  A thousand, we're getting it  That's too much  Oh, man  How low would you go?  It's got to be at least 500  So you'd cut it in half  Five beans  At least  Jimmy's thinking about it  Would you take four?  I saw what it looks like 
[03:10:00]  It's not pretty  It certainly isn't  It's cash, bro  It's cash  How about 450?  I'm thinking 150 from each of us  Oh, you are?

No, I don't want to know what you mean  Like a sock full of mud  That's what it sounds like  All right  God  All right, what else do we have here today?  Uh, this is a cute story  Yep  A 13-year-old Virginia Beach boy  Is being held at the Virginia Beach Detention Center  After police said he abducted an exotic dancer 
[03:14:30]  Last Tuesday night  This just popped up on the news  Dancer showed up at a prearranged appointment at a residence  Subsequently discovered to be vacant  Um, ba-ba-ba-ba  The woman noticed the client was a juvenile  But was told that the contract was for his older brother  Police say the woman waited for a while  But no one else showed up  The woman was eventually, uh, she tried to leave the residence  She was stopped by the juvenile who pointed a shotgun at her 
[03:15:00]  And ordered her to dance  The dancer diverted the boy's attention  And tried to dial 911 on her cell phone  The juvenile then grabbed the phone  During the struggle, the woman bit the boy's hand  And was able to break free and run to her car  See what you chicks do to us guys, especially at that age  He was firing at her feet  He was going, dance, motherfucker, dance  That's the way the whore laughs, man  He's charged with abduction by force 
[03:15:30]  Conspiracy to use a firearm  In the commission of a felony  Brandishing a firearm  And transporting and possessing an assault firearm  At age 13  What a crazy story  Nice  Very good  Alright  Can't get enough of it at that age  Yeah  Oh my god  Good boy  Are we going to get him out of there?  Yes, sir?  When, uh, Keith forced the door open  The door now goes the other way instead of the latch 
[03:16:00]  So now the door hangs open  You can't go into the bathroom without seeing him on the toilet now  Oh, great  Great  I don't care  Oh  Alright, why don't we take a break?  We really got to regroup here  Alright, Opie  I think we got guests  You think?  I think  Yeah  Well, they got to get ready right away  Alright, good  We got guests?

[03:23:30]  Tomorrow  That does not  Conflict  With the one  That we're doing  It happens beforehand  But  They're running the band  It was one of those  Things they want  A band played  And what?  They  They want the band  Promoted  So they come in here  And do stuff  They do the  Devil Went Down to Georgia  This band I see  On the CD  Is it any good?  I haven't heard it yet  That's why it was  Oh there you go  Throw it in  Let's hear  Unless you guys  Want to hear another  Cover  But I think  Devil Went Down to Georgia  That should be  A good example  Am I right or wrong  Am I right or wrong  Hey look at this  Wait a minute  Why did she go away?  Very nice 
[03:24:00]  Wow  Wow alright  She's pretty hot  I want to show her my mule  You can see it  Right through your pants  You disgusting man  You know what's funny?

[03:24:30]  Oh they need more shots  From the Jägermeister machine  All right  All right  The devil in town  Georgia  He was looking for his oldest deal  He said fine  He was way behind  He was looking to make a deal  When he came across  That young boy playing  And playing  I fiddle hot  Then the devil jumped  Upon a hickering slump  Said boy  Let me tell you what  I bet you didn't know it  But I'm a fiddle player too  And if you care  To take your tear  I'll make a bell with you 
[03:25:00]  Now you play pretty good fiddle boy  But give the devil his due  Let a fiddle of gold  Against your soul  Oh the truckers are loving this one today  I like this  I like this  The strumming  There you go  Drawing your eyes  And off your ball  And play that fiddle hard  There's hell's burning  See Georgia  And the devil  Beals in charge  And if you win  You get the shot  The fiddle made of gold  And if you lose  The devil  Get your soul  That's heavy man 
[03:25:30]  The devil opened up  His case  And said I'll start the show  And fire flew from his fingertips  As your eyes  And dumped his bow  And he pulled that bow across strings  That made an evil  Yes  Double bass  It's insane  And it's south of my curse  Alright now he's gonna go bullshit  Here we go  Rock  I like this  I'll give it to him

Well  They're gonna give the plug for the band  They haven't done anything for the official plug  Good tune  But overshadowed by the awesomeness of  Get your cock out  My god this is horrible 
[03:29:00]  Tell them  Yeehaw their ass out of there  Not bad  Just no fiddle  It actually rocks  Fucking amen  Right  I'd rather listen to Anthony's mom sing  Yeah  Well people  We deliver keggers  Someone making a reference to an old show of ours  Yeah  Alright  I thought it was pretty good  The drummer was amazing  Yeah  They did a pretty good job with that cover  What is Ben Sparks doing on CNN getting beat up with a protest sign?  I just got distracted by that again 
[03:29:30]  Some protester walked in on some kind of press conference I guess  Yeah well they're not happy that they're building the new stadium down there in Washington for the  What are they?  The Washington Nationals I think  Is that what that was?  Yeah the Montreal Expo is moving to Washington  It's the Washington Nationals  And the Ben Sparks looking guy is all pissed off because of the  I don't know  I guess the funding's coming from somewhere that he's not happy about or  Something like that  So Ben Sparks on stage  That was pretty hilarious  Ben Sparks with shorter hair  When are they on moving? 
[03:30:00]  Huh?  When are they moving?  Next season they start  Yeah they should  Montreal didn't want baseball  It's great  Wow that was really good  Yeah if you had to come right back in and throw something pointing to the discussion  After a leak how was the bathroom shaping?  It's fine  As you should see Keith try to karate kick the door in the right way now  Because it's all bent out  But it's fine  Yeah  And you know Tom's awake so  Alright well the wheels have fallen off this show  That's right where's the chicks?  They're right out there  But the New York Times paper is up over the window  So I guess we could finally have hardcore nudity in the studio now 
[03:30:30]  We're ready  Let's bring them in  What are we waiting for?  Come on  They're waiting for us to just sit here and do nothing for another few minutes I guess  They got their Jägermeister  They got the  What's going on?

[03:32:00]  It really sucks  Because we love just ripping apart bands  That really suck  But they didn't suck  Yeah it wasn't the song  We were ripping on  Slow down  They actually have a song  That I think would be perfect for you  In your war with  The Little Doggy Company  Alright what song would that be?  That would be  You Don't Stand a Chance  You Don't  Is that the single off the album?  The single is the first song  That's far fetched  But You Don't Stand a Chance  Seems like it would be  Very very appropriate  Where are they playing tomorrow?

This proves how twisted we are on the show.  We'd rather see that mess than these beautiful women.  Speak for yourself.  We're stupid.  Alright, so what do we got going on today?  Well, which would you guys prefer?  Do you want to see some of Diana's contortionist moves first,  or would you like to see their Thanksgiving feast?  Let's see the contortionist moves first. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, definitely, definitely.  Got to do them first.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right up here.  You want me to do that?  Yeah.  Oh, you can hop right up.  I'll say.  Yeah.  Alright.  Alright.  Take off whatever you need.  Move this stuff out of the way.  Please get that horrid image out of my head as quickly as you can.  She's taking her shoes off, Opie.  I see that.  Holy mackerel.  Getting up.  Wow.  What are you doing, bro?  That's much better.  Alright, she's laying face down.  Oh. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, wow.  I'm really not going to have anything to do.  What is she going to do?  Let me move aside.  Get a view.  Alright, she's going to do a headstand, looks like.  Oh.  Yeah, watch that light.  Wow, look at that.  She's going to hit the light.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, yeah, she missed the light.  Hey.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Oh, my God.  Nice.  She's doing a handstand into a split pike position.  Oh, very hot.  Yeah.  I don't know what that was.  What?  No, she brought it away.  Not done.  Oh, we applaud anyway.  Oh, you're not done? 
[03:42:00]  Much gooder if you're naked.  Yeah.  Oh, that was easy.  Watch the light over your head.  She hits her head on the lamp.  She's removing her brassiere.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Oh, nice nips.  Right one pierced, belly button pierced.  You don't see this in the Olympics.  Tongue pierced.  Brunette.  She's terrific.  Dark eyes.  Very nice body.  Ow.  Careful.  She just banged her foot on the light.  Master Poe, of course, has to spot her. 
[03:42:30]  He's spotting her.  What a gentleman.  Yeah.  Diana might be doing this at Looney Tunes tomorrow night, 31 Brookville Avenue.  Oh, that's right.  When point blank plays.  Oh.  Very nice.  Wow.  Wow, that's nice.  I don't like that.  Oh, my God.  She's actually our thong model on the website.  Oh, yeah?  She seems shy about showing her thong.  Would that website be pointblank.com?  Dot TV.  Dot TV?  Yes.  No, no, I'm just saying you seem shy.  I'm not being mean.  Don't put it on your rod. 
[03:43:00]  I don't think I can do a split today, because I don't get a chance to warm up before.  Show that little picture on your thong, Diana.  No, I really can't.  You can't?  Just do a split on the...  No?  No, it's the fact that I didn't warm up beforehand.  Don't make a deal.  I thought she was going to leave a slug trail on the console.  Oh, I gave a lap dance when I sprained my hamstring.  It wasn't doing gymnastics.  It was doing gymnastics giving a lap dance.  Really?  Oh.  Yeah.  You gave lap dances?  Nice.  I'm to friends.  Oh.  I'm not like a stripper.  No, I'm not.  Of course not.  I'd like to be my friend.  All right, now what's happening?  Are we talking wood floor?  I could do a split, but on the table. 
[03:43:30]  Wood floor, yeah.  I could see through the underwear.  I couldn't.  It was great.  Can we do a move without the underwear?  Yeah.  Possibly?  You could just tell.  It was wood floor.  I could do a split on the table.  Oh, I could have gotten right there.  All right, you want to do a split?  All right, the other girl, the blonde with the huge cans, is taking off her jeans.  Oh, I want to wipe my bag.  Hey, Tippi Tom, what do you think?  Tippi Tom, I'm right here.  Where are you, Tippi?  Oh, yeah.  I don't think he can.  Tippi.  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  Golden buns, where are you?  Tippi Tom, I'm ready to get up.  You getting up again?  Yeah.  What are you going to do, a split?  I ate my candy bar.  Are you doing a split in your undershorts?  Look who's taking the field.  Very lovely.  All right, you want me to get up, dude?  Yeah, why don't you get up?  Ow.  Don't say this.  Very nice split.  Yeah, you don't.  That works great on radio.  Very nice.  If I can do it, I can do it.  All right, you want to do a split, Tippi Tom? 
[03:44:30]  Oh, boy.  Tippi Tom, come over here now.  All right, come on up.  You didn't like that table, did you?  All right, Tippi Tom, I'm ready to get busy.  All right, come on up, Tom.  Come on.  Let me get what I do.  All right.  No, don't have him.  Please, just don't have him do anything.  I've had my fill of Tippi Tom for the day.  If he could just keep his clothes on, that would be more.  I was over in this corner, and I was catching a waft of what was going on.  It was hilarious.  It had to be the worst smell ever.  No, it was all right.  You're used to the smell.  Yeah.  Wait a minute, after all of that. 
[03:45:00]  You got your $2 worth today.  Wait a minute.  After all of that that I just did, I want to hear a song.  Come on now.  That was worth a song.  A song?  Well, if you did a bottle of this, maybe.  That was so good, and I was spread eagle.  God damn it.  I want to hear a freaking song.  He's saying you should do it without your panties on.  Huh?  He's saying you should do it without your underpants.  No, no.  What about without the skirt?  He said that.  Tippy Tom?  Without the skirt?  Do I get a song if I do it without the skirt, but I leave my tongue on?  Let's...  All right, here comes Tippy Tom first. 
[03:45:30]  What does Tippy Tom do when he's taking all his clothes off?  Oh, no.  Go ahead, Tom.  Go, Tom.  Tom's getting to a split now.  Tom.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's taking his...  No.  All right, what else are you taking off, Tom?  Tom has good abs.  He sure does.  You want to dance?  Yeah, bravo, Dan.  All right, Tippy Tom is now topless, Anthony.  He's got a scarf on.  He put a scarf on.  He put his scarf on. 
[03:46:00]  All right, let's stand back.  All right, stand back.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He can't do it.  He's got a body like E.T.  It's horrifying.  Can I do it up here?  Yeah, yeah, he can do it up there.  No, you can't.  It'll be false.  No, no, no, no.  Don't do the equipment.  You're crazy.  No.  All right, you might as well take all your clothes off.  Oh, no.  No, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, that is serious.  Oh, gross.  He's dancing.  Bro, what color are those underwear? 
[03:46:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I can't take this.  I've never seen that current underwear in my life.  All right.  Oh, God.  Turn it off.  He's still got his underwear on.  What's wrong with you, Tom?  What are you, shy?  No, shut up.  I got a little mule.  Let him be shy.  Please let him be shy.  I don't want to show him away that.  Oh, you got a little mule?  All right.  He's got a little mule?  Yeah, I'm a little short.  Wow, man.  That's a...  What color is that underwear?  Like a grayish green?  Gray green. 
[03:47:00]  It's a moth.  This is like military fatigues underwear.  It's camo.  Yeah.  I can't hope.  Yeah.  All right, Timmy.  Camo.  All right.  It's just all...  I am the best-looking mother person in this world.  All right, Timmy Tom, you want to...  Kiss my...  All right, you only have your underwear on.  You better look at me.  All right, once you...  Nice.  Once you...  I'll give you her number. 
[03:47:30]  I'll give you her number before we get out of here, okay?  This is atrocious.  I'm still packing five.  What?  No, I'll give you her number before we leave.  Do you have a phone?  All right.  You're kicking me out.  How's he going to call her?  No, I'm not kicking you out.  All right, Timmy Tom.  You are more than welcome to stay here as long as I am.  Anyone else want to get naked?  What would you like to see them do?  Sure.  I want to hear some music, man.  I want to get busy.  That's what I'm saying.  All right, why don't you sing a...  Timmy Tom, why don't you sing a song?  I'm talking about let's get busy.  All right, go ahead.  Let's get naked, man, and let everybody start fucking. 
[03:48:00]  And water.  I think we have a song for that.  That would be track two.  Look, I was born in the Roman Empire.  I was miserable.  No, that's when you bathed.  And Caligula.  Good one.  Nice.  Caligula.  Good one.  Was my man.  All right, why don't you sing a little ditty?  A little song.  Caligula?  Yes.  All right, sing some.  You want to hear about Caligula?  Yes.  I know a lot about that. 
[03:48:30]  Okay.  I read so many books, I don't know how many I read.  In jail?  Am I gay?  Well, yeah.  It's possible.  Close.  It's possible I'm gay.  He's bisexual.  I think I'm gay.  Well, you're bisexual, right?  Would you have sex with her?  If she lets you, would you have sex with her?  Or would you have sex with young Eric?  This kid's cute, isn't he?  I never. 
[03:49:00]  He cheated on me.  I don't know.  All right.  Sing a song there, Tippi.  I think he a cheating, motherfucker.  Cheat on Tippi Tom.  What you did?  All right, sing a song.  I thought we were going to get together.  What is he going off about?  Yeah, you ran over somebody else.  All right.  Anyway, what I'm saying is this, is that Tippi Tom is very unhappy.  Yeah.  Because I ain't got no whipped cream.  Here you go, honey.  All right. 
[03:49:30]  Oh, God.  All right.  We're done with that.  We're done with that.  I guess we'll be throwing out the whipped cream that we're going to use on the girls.  I wonder how much Danny would charge to lick whipped cream off Tom's nipple.  All right.  Danny, how much?  I got 20.  I'll do that for free.  All right, Tom, what are we doing?  You have taken over the show.  What do you want to do?  All right.  Hold on now.  You know, I write stuff.  Do you direct?  Whenever I write, I feel like writing. 
[03:50:00]  Scarf around his neck.  When I don't write, I don't feel like writing.  That's all it is.  You look like a superhero.  I'm not better than anybody.  The Aids man.  But when I got my pants down, I am not touching you.  You might as well take your underwear off.  You're still wearing underwear.  No.  Nobody gets to see my feet.  You had a big bag.  Yeah, why don't you take your underwear down?  Because nobody gets to see my feet.  I'm very embarrassed about my feet. 
[03:50:30]  Because my feet.  Why are they clean?  Embarrassed about his feet?  My feet are ugly.  And are small.  All right.  But this is big.  Oh.  Yeah.  Atta boy, Tom.  Why don't you show the ladies what you're packing there, Tom.  Show me a hog.  Who cares?  Yeah, we're all just.  I'll show you my ass.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is golden buns.  Golden buns.  Golden buns.  You mess around with golden buns, man. 
[03:51:00]  You know who you're dealing with, man.  Golden buns.  I think those are more bronze.  Oh, my God.  I gave you a freebie.  All right.  Very good.  I gave you a freebie.  Yeah, we got the freebie.  Thank you, Tibby Tom.  I think I need to be paid.  All right.  Well, let's get back to the ladies here.  Thank you. 
[03:51:30]  So what are we going to do now?  I think she better look than me.  And thank you for making us that thing.  That was very nice.  You're very welcome.  I think Annabelle might be cajoled into giving Jimmy a lap dance if he asks nicely.  Okay.  Cajoled?  And he will.  I'd love a lap dance.  I haven't gotten one ever since the NW days.  Do you need the baby food for that?  What was the food products?  What were we going to do?  Some pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving and some pieces.  Did you want to do something on the console with that? 
[03:52:00]  Because I think we're ready for the grand finale.  And if you guys do a good job, we'll play a song from Point Blank, I think.  Right, Ann?  Yeah, there you go.  Thank you.  Oh, I can't get over this.  This is like...  Oh, my God.  All right, we're filming all this for the website.  No, my turn, too.  Are you dining or am I dining?  All right, we got the pumpkin pie out and the brunette and the blonde.  What?  She's taking over the stage.  She's taking over the stage. 
[03:52:30]  Does that make you unhappy there?  More nudity.  Tippi Tom?  More nudity.  More nudity that isn't Tippi Tom.  And Tippi Tom's really hungry.  Tippi Tom pissed off.  Tippi Tom pissed on himself when he looks for the underwear.  He's looking at that pumpkin pie going, don't waste that.  I'm hungry.  They don't like Tippi Tom.  They got Tippi Tom spray.  They like Tippi Tom.  They like Tippi Tom.  It's all calm down.  Everyone likes you.  Where are all those scabs from, Tom?  I think they don't like Tippi Tom.  Hold on here, Opie. 
[03:53:00]  Tippi Tom.  My turn.  All right.  The brunette needs attention.  Yeah.  Take that off.  Yay.  I can't believe my mama.  Oh, there we go.  Very nice.  Get that skirt on.  It's down to just the thong.  I might show you.  The point blank thong.  You're rubbing yourself like an animal.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Tom, put your clothes back on.  Jesus.  Please.  And the blonde is now topless as well. 
[03:53:30]  Very nice.  Bravo.  Are those real?  Yeah, they are, right?  I'll say they are.  Fantagous.  There we go.  Looks like 36 D.  No?  30-40.  30-40.  Very nice.  Okay.  I was trying to explain to them how you guess ages, Opie.  I do guess ages.  They didn't want to do it that way.  That's all right.  Do you know my age?  Guess Tippi Tom's age, Opie.  No.  Do you know my age?  No, I don't.  I don't know who we have. 
[03:54:00]  I do a whole thing.  It's good.  But you guys do the pumpkin pie thing.  Huh?  It's like a whole thing.  A whole thing.  Just about.  You got that right.  All right.  So here we go.  I am horrified.  All right.  We got the hot blonde and the hot brunette on the counter, Anthony, in front of us, both  topless and their point-blank thongs.  The little gymnast is laying down now on her back and getting whipped cream put on her  nippies.  Nice.  Could Tippi Tom lick that off?  It's only a tongue. 
[03:54:30]  Why not?  Tippi Tom, you want some whipped cream?  They don't like Tippi Tom.  They love Tippi Tom.  I don't know if I go with that one.  I like whipped cream.  Would you go for that whipped cream?  What do you think?  You want to lick some whipped cream?  No, I'll get my clothes on.  Well, that's okay.  You don't have to do it naked.  I'll get my clothes on.  Yeah, you really needed to put your clothes on.  What am I supposed to do?  Fight this guy?  No.  All right.  Tippi, come here.  I don't feel a fight no more.  Come here.  Don't touch me. 
[03:55:00]  Let him lick you.  Let him lick you.  This would be a silly goose.  Oh, my God.  Don't take it all.  Take it all.  Take it all.  Put it in your mouth.  Put it in your mouth.  It fell all over the console.  I fucked up.  All right.  He's fucked up.  I've got to get out of here.  I am disgusted.  And we've got the hot girl with the whipped cream in front of us on her nips and down 
[03:55:30]  her belly.  We need a whistle.  This would have been a good time for Devil Went Down to Georgia.  I know.  That was a good version.  We like that.  I feel like jerking off.  He said exactly what we're all feeling.  Good call, Tom.  The first sane thing he said all day.  Jimmy Tom.  All right.  The one is licking the whipped cream off the boobies.  Tom just almost shoved his face in that girl's ass.  Scrap one out.  No one's looking.  Yeah, Tom.  If you have to, do what comes naturally. 
[03:56:00]  We don't care.  The only problem is I'm a queer.  So what?  What's wrong with being a queer, right?  Nothing.  In God's eyes.  You're a queer, but you're digging this, right?  But I like our ass.  You like our ass?  Wow.  All right.  No.  No.  No.  No.  The one girl is licking whipped cream off the nipples of the other girl.  He won't bother your ass.  Dude, that ass is on that couch.  So what?  Let him stay there.  We don't sit.  Oh, yeah.  Up, up, up.  Yeah, he's got to sit on the...  Very nice.  Oh, God. 
[03:56:30]  I want a new studio.  Look at the rack on her.  Holy mackerel.  All right.  They're making out.  Wow.  The legs are on her.  Yeah, this is hot.  Steve's right in there, so...  Good boy, Steve.  I like that leg coming around, spurring her ass.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Another...  Holding on.  Very nice.  They're just rubbing the whipped cream all over each other.  I feel like jacking off.  You got...  I feel like jacking off.  I'm going to jerk off. 
[03:57:00]  That's what I'm going to do.  You should, Tom.  Show him who's boss.  Yeah, go ahead, Tom.  We don't care.  Show him who's boss.  Give me Tom.  I'm going to jerk off.  Give me a very nice.  That would work better than a loaded gun if you wave that thing at people.  How did you get all that from?  Very nice.  Very nice.  And there's the...  I'm going to jerk off right now.  All right.  Go ahead, Tom.  If you have to, you might as well.  You got to scrap.  Go ahead.  No one's looking.  Are you too insane?  Let him scrap.  He's been doing everything you say.  Just don't.  Someone wants us to describe the girls. 
[03:57:30]  We got a very hot blonde with very big boobs, very natural, and a very hot brunette.  A little more petite.  Steve C. is taking some videos.  Of course.  Yeah, you can catch it all online.  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom is going to jerk off.  All right.  All right.  You might as well.  You're all talking no action.  You're all talking no action, pal.  I want approval.  Oh, you got...  We gave you the approval.  You say I got the balls to jerk off?  Yes, you didn't have the balls to do it.  There's no way we're going to have a homeless guy jerking off in front of two real hot lesbians. 
[03:58:00]  That's what we really want.  I can jerk off.  You can't jerk off.  I bet you can.  I dare you to jerk off.  Who said I'm a lesbian?  Well, for the bit, you're lesbians.  It makes it easy.  This is the best of humanity and the worst of humanity, all in the same room.  Tom, you have no balls.  You have no balls.  Give me Tom to jerk off.  No, I bet you won't.  I got $20 says you don't.  I can jerk off.  I got balls. 
[03:58:30]  I got $20 says you don't.  You bet me $20.  I'll bet you $20.  Here, I'll even give it to Keith.  You won't jerk off for $20.  Well, give me a few minutes.  See, I'll talk no action.  We've got five minutes left.  Five.  We've got two minutes left in the show.  $20.  Yeah, because he needs pumpkin pie.  Give it to Tom.  Yeah, Tom.  Tom, you ain't jerking off.  I'm jerking off.  You're not jerking off.  I've got two minutes.  Tom has plenty of pumpkin pie in the back of his underwear. 
[03:59:00]  Eric, show him your ass so he can get it up.  You know damn well, Timmy Tom can jerk off.  Oh, yeah?  I don't think you can.  I got $20 says you don't.  Yeah?  Yeah, why don't you give it a shot?  You lying motherfucker.  Oh, yeah, here.  You know damn well I can jerk off.  See, you're not jerking off.  All right.  That thing might go off.  You want me to jerk off?  I want you to jerk off.  As you get ready to do that, I'm going to play a little bit of Point Blank here.  20 bucks and a bottle of Gagamite.  This is You Don't Stand a Chance.  Pointblank.tv.  I am horrified. 
[03:59:30]  Pointblank.tv.  I'm sorry.  See, you're not going to jerk off?  Stand for him so he can.  If these girls over her legs and they keep going running around me, I'll be jerking off.  I got some funny.  You're out of your mind.  All right.  Let me share this to make you look like fucking balls.  Let her, let her, let her, let her open your fucking balls.  All right.  You jerk off on the fucking table. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, God.  This is your last chance, Tibby Tom, or you don't get the 20 bucks.  Let's go.  Two minutes left in the show.  Get the plug for Point Blank.  Pointblank.tv.  They're going to be at Looney Tunes, 31 Brookvale Avenue in West Babylon tomorrow at 7 p.m.  Tibby Tom's going to jerk off.  All right.  Here goes Tibby Tom.  He's going to whack off for $20.  Tibby Tom's going to whack off.  Jimmy's doing his dance, too.  No, no, no.  Just do it on the...  No, no, no.  No, no, no. 
[04:00:30]  No, just...  No, no.  Tibby Tom, we only have a minute left in the show.  You got to do it.  Come on.  Let's go.  20 bucks right now.  All right.  His pants look down.  Oh, my God.  He's going to whack it off.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I thought I could jerk off here.  No.  Just stop.  Oh, my God.  You said I could jerk off here.  You're jerking off.  Holy crap.  I said I jerk off over here.  And Jimmy Norton's going to laugh dance in the corner. 
[04:01:00]  Stop it.  You said I could jerk off here.  You are jerking off.  Relax.  This is lying fucking shit.  You said I could jerk off every year.  Get him out of here.  Fuck, man.  You ain't getting no jerk off things.  You said I could do a line on the table.  How much time left in this awful show?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And Jimmy's getting a lap dance in the corner. 
[04:01:30]  I thought I could jerk off on stage.  I want to thank Point Blank for coming in today.  Thank you, guys.  In the background, it's You Don't Stand a Chance from their CD, Cast the First Stone.  You ladies were awesome.  See you guys at the downtown tomorrow.  Yeah.  Anthony and I will be at the downtown tomorrow in Farmingdale.  I didn't jerk off.  You jerked off.  You could have my $20.  Trust me.  We didn't want to see much more than that anyway.  All right.  Get off our lesbian couch, though, please.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  You know something?  He just had his hands on himself, and now if he touches anything, I need this whole place 
[04:02:00]  disinfected now.  You said I could jerk off on the fucking stage, and I can't.  Now I'm pissed off at you.  You're pissed off.  Take my $20 and the Jägermeister.  We are out of here.

[04:03:30]  It's the energy levels right after sex.  Girls get all energetic.  My girlfriend wants to cook stuff.  She's got a cake in the oven.  She's roasting a pig on a spit that she killed with her own bare hands.  You know, she's painting the house, raking leaves.  Meanwhile, I'm at the hospital.  My blood pressure is three over one.  I'm on life support systems.  The doctor's like, he came three times?  That means irreversible brain damage.  Guys have no energy after sex, do they?  I'm surprised rapists don't get caught every time. 
[04:04:00]  So, Officer, how'd you up-ran the suspect?  Well, he chased him 50 feet and he passed out.  Where's the woman?  She's in the woods doing jumping jacks.  After I have sex, my legs are like a newborn calf.  You know, I'm in the kitchen in my underwear trying to make a sandwich.  Look out the window.  She's put in a built-in pool.  Yeah, is 80 feet deep enough, honey? 
[04:04:30]  What did I shoot into you?  Cracks it out, for crying out.  We'll have sex tomorrow night and clean the garage.  And I mean, after a good blowjob, I need a walker.  Only one thing got me out of college.  High school. 
[04:05:00]  That high school was tough.  And grammar school, I couldn't spell at all.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  And the count.  I always left the U out.  Teacher gave me $100.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse. 
[04:05:30]  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse.  I used to miss words like Posse. </pre>
