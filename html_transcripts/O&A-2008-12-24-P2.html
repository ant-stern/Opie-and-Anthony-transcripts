<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the lack of Christmas bonuses, quickly transitioning into a lengthy promotion for their annual Eggnog Drinking Contest.  This led to a segment featuring former intern Pat Duffy, who recounted his participation in the 2006 Eggnog Challenge and a video showcasing the event's copious vomiting.  Pat also revealed his recent, short-lived romance and his girlfriend's unusual living situation with a man named "Master Po," prompting much joking from the hosts.  The show advertised upcoming guests Bill Burr, Joe Rogan, and Bob Saget, and previewed the upcoming Eggnog Drinking Contest, featuring contestants including Sergeant Magoo, notorious for his vomit-related stunts.  The contest then began, with Joe Rogan among the in-studio participants.  Contestants drank double shots of eggnog every minute, with elimination upon vomiting.  "Flea" was an early casualty, slated for a choking by Joe Rogan. Sergeant Magoo's prodigious vomiting, mixed with Fruit Loops, caused a chain reaction of vomiting among other participants and crew members, including "E-Rock," resulting in a studio filled with the smell described as "swamp ass."  A listener volunteered for an internship in exchange for catching Pat from Manaki's vomit. Pat from Manaki ultimately won, but the broadcast ended with him preparing to break his own record, with the new intern ready to receive his vomit.

Next, a segment centered on "The Baby Bird" stunt, where Pat Fuminaki, after consuming 75 double shots of eggnog, vomited into Pat Duffy's mouth. This graphic event, extensively filmed, elicited strong reactions from the studio audience. The hosts predicted its viral spread, as it was uploaded to Joe Rogan's website. This was followed by a retrospective interview with Pat Duffy, expressing little regret (except for the event itself).  The segment also included clips from Dave Rabbit, a DJ broadcasting from a Vietnamese brothel during the Vietnam War, featuring crude humor and advertisements for the brothel's services. The show concluded this portion with an in-studio interview with Chubby Checker, who discussed his career, "The Twist," and anecdotes about his interactions with Cassius Clay.  He also mentioned his wife Rina's hospitalization, requesting prayers.  Bill Burr and Ari Gold were mentioned as other guests.


The Chubby Checker interview continued with lighthearted banter, mistaken identities with other musicians, a spontaneous performance of "The Twist" with the house band Sabra Cadabra, and tangents on Hurricane Katrina, Chubby's age, the 2008 presidential election, and government regulations.  Several planned surprise guests for Chubby's birthday were either cancelled or went awry, adding to the comedic chaos.

A caller, Travis, then recounted a parking lot altercation at Ikea with his wife, sparking a discussion on appropriate responses to aggressive behavior.  Jimmy, another caller, shared a similar story involving a pizza delivery driver.  The conversation included discussions on marijuana legalization for tax revenue, the societal impact of alcohol, and a brief call from Dave from Chicago about Texas breathalyzer practices in bars.  There was also a brief musical interlude and mentions of "Piss Wasa."

The final segment returned to Travis's Ikea altercation, focusing on his girlfriend Lisaâ€™s role in escalating the situation and the appropriate response to confrontations. The hosts and callers debated physical intervention versus de-escalation, using highly offensive language and exploring violent scenarios. The conversation shifted to Sherry Shepherd from *The View*,  criticizing her statements on religion, science, and personal history. A born-again Christian caller attempted to clarify some of Shepherd's comments about Jesus. The segment concluded with further discussion of Shepherd's statements and playful banter.

[00:00:00]  I lost my temper when I got my bonus, and I guess I said a few things I shouldn't have.  Bonus? How did you get a bonus?  I cut out bonuses this year.  Yeah, and thanks for telling us.  I've gotten a Christmas bonus every year but this one.  You don't want to give bonuses, fine.  But when people count on them as part of their salary,  oh, what you did just plain sucks.  Thank you, Russ.

Why can't we give lay-up, give lay-up, give lay-up, give lay-up, give lay-up, give lay-up, give lay-up, give lay-up, give lay-up, give lay-up?  Cause there's such a general fashion word, and let's dare you to care for the people on the edge of the night. 
[00:03:00]  And the day that you do change our ways of caring about ourselves  This is our last dance  This is our last dance  This is ourselves 
[00:03:30]  Under pressure  I'm Sam and I'm talking in a regular radio voice  What are we doing here?  We're promoting you  Alright, Sam  Why? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, why?  Why are we promoting Pat Duffy?  Well, we're about to play the Baby Bird, I think  Yes, from 2006  Of course  It's the Eggnog Drinking Challenge  This is where we met Pat Duffy for the first time  And by we, we mean the Opie and Anthony Show  I'm Sam from Opie and Anthony with Eric, a.k.a. E-Rock  And intern extraordinaire Pat Duffy is with us  Former intern extraordinaire  Former intern extraordinaire  But this was the 2006 Eggnog Challenge  And it's where the Baby Bird first happened 
[00:04:30]  One of the most monumentous events to happen  Since Opie and Anthony have been on XM  I remember I had been on staff for a couple months at that point  And one of my main responsibilities was videoing things  And when we set this up, I realized  Just the pressure on me  I can't imagine the pressure on you  Because I realized that if I screwed up this camera angle  I might as well just quit  I've been there for a few months  And this was my test  Yeah, it came out very well, though  Well, thank you  I think you deserve more credit than I do, though  Well, thank you 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, it was really not a fun experience  But it paid off in the end, I feel  Did you have anything like that in your head when you came to the studio?  I had no idea  All I knew was that I wanted to step above the rest of the pack  And I knew I had to pull out all the stops  All right, well then let's start it  Yeah  Here's the first part of the Eggnog Challenge 2006  On the worst of Opie and Anthony  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  And what a busy, busy show it's gonna be 
[00:05:30]  People setting up stuff and everything  Plastic is being set up all over the studio  That can only mean one thing  Tarps  That can only mean one thing, my friend  That's right 
[00:06:00]  It is the annual, the third annual, I believe  Third annual Eggnog Drinking Contest  This is how we welcome in the Christmas season every single year  How else are you supposed to welcome in the Christmas time of year  Than a nice eggnog drinking contest  All of our pals show up every year  Some of the same faces, some new ones, some new competitors  And bottom line is, how much eggnog can you drink 
[00:06:30]  Before it all comes rumbling back  With that wonderful sound like an Evinrude engine  Being tested in a 55-gallon drum  Love it  And the contest is very, very, very simple for you at home  These guys will drink a double shot of eggnog  Every single minute  Until we got one standing 
[00:07:00]  You puke, you're out  You puke, you're out  The current record holder is Pat from Munaki  He set the record last year  Even though he lost the competition  Set the record, lost the competition  Interesting finish we had last year  Well, because you got a whole minute to drink your double shot of eggnog  So there's a little strategy involved  So what happened was  Yeah, Pat drank his 70-second double shot of eggnog  And puked  And Badlands Booker 
[00:07:30]  He still had time to get his 70-second shot down  And he did  He didn't have to  Oh, that's right  At that point, he didn't have to  You're right  First one to woof  That's it  Absolutely  Yeah, okay, you're right  And then he puked after Pat from Munaki  Right after  Like, they were both holding it in  And they were trying their best not to puke  Pat was the first  Yeah, you're right  Pat was the first to do the 70-second double shot of eggnog  Puked right after that  But Badlands Booker had, you know  Time left in his minute  And he didn't have to drink it at that point  And then he proceeded to puke right after Pat 
[00:08:00]  He woofed  It was an amazing finish  Let's just put it that way  Photo finish  Amazing  We wound up meeting a lot of people  That stay kind of friends at the show, too  Yeah  It's like, this is what we say around the Opie and Anthony show  There are no strangers in the eggnog contest  Only friends we haven't met yet  Remember we said that?  Not at all  Hey, what's his name here?  Who's going to, like, do a little puke  And then eat some Froot Loops for us?  Oh, uh, Sarge  Sarge? Sergeant Magoo? 
[00:08:30]  Sergeant Magoo  Sergeant Magoo  Yeah, well, on the PalTalk camera the other day  We watched him, uh, eat butter sticks  And, uh, cream and milk and ketchup  And then, uh, woof it all into a Tupperware bowl  He then poured in Froot Loops  Into what he had vomited  And, and ate it  Dude, that's awful  It was so awful to watch  Even on, on PalTalk  I couldn't imagine watching that live  Yeah  But he said he's going to do it  I, uh, I don't know if I want to watch that 
[00:09:00]  And speaking of PalTalk  Uh, the eggnog drinking contest  Of course, we'll be on PalTalk for all to see  Yeah  For all to see  Join in  And then we're going to be making videos  And we'll throw those up on YouTube  And opiananthony.com  You get the deal  By the way, uh, this isn't the greatest puking show  That, uh, that we, that, that we do  What?  Nothing will ever beat  The, uh, the puking that happened in Boston  Back in the day  At WBCN 
[00:09:30]  Uh, the clam chowder?  Yeah, the clam chowder thing  That was a goodie  That was a great contest  Same, same concept  You eat as much, you know, clam chowder  Uh, as possible  And if you puke you out  You're out  If you won, you were going to the Super Bowl, I guess  Yeah, and then, um, we got a winner  And then we so happened to have another pair of  Super Bowl tickets  So we got four or five guys  That were out of the competition  Oh  To try again  And basically what they had to do  Man, I hope you're not eating breakfast  They had to take a, a, uh, a spoon 
[00:10:00]  A nice heaping spoonful  A tablespoonful  Of the puke that was in the barrel  That's right  Everyone was using the same barrel  And the contest was simple  All they had to do was  Hold down the tablespoon of puke  For one minute, I think  Yeah  I think it was just a minute  And they're going to the Super Bowl as well  There were guys gagging  Before they even brought the spoon up to their mouth 
[00:10:30]  They took a spoon  Remember, there were a couple of guys  That took a spoonful  Looked at it  And just started going  Bleah!  Bleah!  Oh, it was just amazing  And contestant after contestant  Could not keep this lousy  Tablespoon of puke down  So they continued puking some more  And then the contestants  That were waiting to try  To win the tickets for the Super Bowl  Yeah  They started puking  Even though they weren't even doing it yet  Just watching  It just became a complete 
[00:11:00]  And utter mess that day  It was a vomitorium  It was amazing  It was truly amazing  So we'll see what happens today  With the eggnog drinking contest  We're going to start right around 7 o'clock  So we're getting close  Less than an hour away  We're signing in the contestants  And we'll get to know the contestants  And we'll start drinking some eggnog  In less than an hour here  I want a shot of eggnog  No, you don't  Oh, traditionally I do one a year  Eggnog is awful  It really is awful  The name itself is horrible 
[00:11:30]  What is a nog?  What is it to do to an egg  That makes it nogged?  I don't know  And is there egg in it?  Who the hell knows?  And what the hell is nog?  Who the hell knows?

Yeah  I gotta tell you  We've been very, very busy  Yesterday we spent the whole afternoon  Into the night 
[00:12:00]  Filming a TV commercial  I think it's gonna turn out pretty good  Should be on TV within a week I guess  A little over a week  I think they'll have a rough cut in a week  And then shortly after that  It'll start hitting the air  Yeah, we had a lot of fun with it  We don't wanna give too much away  No  But we certainly had a lot of fun  Jimmy's involved  Jimmy's involved in the commercial  Finally  Uh-huh  There's an acknowledgement  That Jim Norton is a part of this program  Oh guys, I don't know  And his part in it 
[00:12:30]  Classic  Oh yeah  Just some good acting  I'm gonna do an actor  I can't help it  I was motivated  Certainly were  I wanted to keep leaning in  And just, come on guys  Could you give me more  Could you give me more  Yeah, could you  You know, I'm not really feeling  I know  To work with Jimmy Norton  Uh, you know  This is a guy that was in  A blockbuster action film  Spider-Man  Yeah  He was in Spider-Man  I have now worked  We felt privileged  I have now worked  With a man  That was in  A blockbuster movie 
[00:13:00]  Well, you know  I understand it's very intimidating  To be on the set  It was  I was nervous  You know  What will he do as an actor  I think  I think the outtakes  Are gonna be a huge hit  With the listeners  Oh yeah  I guess we can't give much away  As far as the commercial goes  Just let it sit for now  Okay  Just let it sit  But a bunch of questions coming in  What did Jimmy do with his hands  Oh, he was holding onto it  They wanna know  A doorknob  As tight as he could  They were  Yeah  And the other hand  Was on a wall  For the people that are familiar  With this program  And the questions that we ask 
[00:13:30]  Every actor that comes in here  What do you do with your hands  When you're acting  It's very awkward  They can't just dangle at your sides  You can't just use them  For something silly  You gotta be natural  You gotta look natural  And it's always been an issue  With Jimmy  Yeah  And uh  Well, he just finds a way  In this commercial  To not have to worry about  What he's doing with his hands  I held my left one  Like Quincy  Which was  Having all your fingers clenched  And kind of out in front of you  Out in front of you  Like you're pontificating  Yes  And in my right arm

Didn't he last?  Yeah the first one  He won the first one  He should have won  Oh last year  Last year he set the record  But lost the contest  Oh he lost 
[00:52:30]  The weird thing  Where he took the shot  That put him over the top  He had more shots  Than the other guy  There were only two left  But he puked  Before the other guy puked  It's all about who pukes first  Who pukes first  You got a minute to do that shot  And Badlands decided  He was going to sit and wait  Wait it out  When Pat did the shot immediately  Then Pat puked  Badlands didn't have to do the shot  And then he puked  Pretty much right after Pat  It was that close last year  It was so close  Hey Pat what's the record  71  71 
[00:53:00]  Right  Same thing  Sorry everyone's talking  I'm sorry about that  I was yelling over you guys  But the record is 71  Double shots of eggnog  That's what we're looking for today  Do we have an organized squad  That can fill all these cups  In the allotted time  Alright  We own two guys  Didn't we have more last time  I don't like this  We might want to get a third guy  Just in case  Just in case  If there's a problem  On the first round  Make sure we get some  Ready reserve in there  It looks like they're going to go  Christmas caroling 
[00:53:30]  Yeah  Alright  Here's the deal  Just to set it up  For everybody at home  It's the eggnog drinking contest  We've got puke buckets  All over the studio  We've got tons of eggnog  These guys will do  A double shot of eggnog  Every single minute  Until they puke  They puke  They're out  Until one guy is standing  And they will be doing it  Through commercial break  Yeah well we're going to take  A break  We talked to you  No  Oh okay  We didn't talk to him  Amish beard  Real quick  What's your name sir  My name's Pat  Pat and where do you hail from  I hail from New Jersey

Getting a little full  It's very thick  Yeah  Very thick  Sergeant Magoo saying it's very thick  It's getting full  Did you eat before you came here?  No I did not  I planned on eating here  Yeah  Shot time by the way  Awful  Shot time by the way  There he goes  Oh is that the dude that had to throw up with the  The Fruit Loops  The Fruit Loops yeah  He brought his Fruit Loops so he's gonna give us a little sideshow later  Are you really gonna eat your own puke with Fruit Loops?

Yeah  Not Pat from Monaki  Pat Duffy  Creepy beard Pat  Oh okay  Alright  Pat is a  Loser Pat  He kind of winced  A loser Pat  What about growing up gaudy?  How's he doing?

That's awful  That would be the real contest  Training for this?  Yeah these guys  Joe this is a big thing every year  Another shot  Huh?  My first time ever trying eggnog  Really?  It's delicious  Sergeant Magoo doesn't even have a chance  He's here to do the fruit loop trick  Later  He's doing his own throw up  Yeah  We're just waiting for the throw up to happen  Do we got a bowl?  We got a bowl for Sergeant Magoo? 
[01:04:00]  Oh a pitcher  Oh that is going to really sound horrid  I'm looking at Pat Duffy over there  And that last shot really was hard  I probably got another 5 minutes left  That's about it  Yeah  I love nog though  That's the thing  Huh?  I love nog  It's so good  It just sucks so bad  And there's so much  When it comes back  You'll be able to taste it all over again  Yeah because I noticed  He kind of started drinking that down  He had to stop  He had to like swallow  He winced a little  And then finished it  So if you're at that point now 
[01:04:30]  You're in trouble  Then it's not a lot of time  Uh oh  I got a little pre-puke belch over there  Yeah  Which guy?  Which guy?  Just trying to get rid of gases  So I can put more room  Sergeant Magoo is burping  Which is a prelude  We all know that  Just a little air in the lines  What about our young lady?

Oh yeah  Alright good  Anybody eating their own puke  That's hardcore  How about if Magoo ate someone else's puke?  That's even more hardcore

[01:07:30]  Oh  Oh  I bow to you today. 
[01:08:00]  Did he drink a gallon before you came here?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  What?  Can I get an intern job?  Oh, that's the intern.  Yes, hire him.  Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy is out.  What's your name again?  Pat.  That was Pat?  That's me, Pat. 
[01:08:30]  Pat, we've been doing this.  Hold on.  We've been doing this for three years.  I've never seen anyone puke that much.  That was power booting.  That could be the best puke we've seen in three years.  Power booting.  I did Fear Factor for six seasons.  I never saw anybody throw up like that.  That was some puking, man.  I'll throw up on the street on the walkover.  All right.  Yes.  Oh, God, yes.  That'll be fine.  Don't count me out yet.  Dude, congrats.  You have probably the best puke sound effect.  That's awesome.  By the way.  It sounded like it was on loop.  Yeah.  No, that was one guy puking over and over again. 
[01:09:00]  By the way.  With the exact same noise.  By the way, we did a really good job there.  When these guys start puking, we've got to try to stay as quiet as possible.  Yeah.  It's really hard.  It really is hard because it is so freaking fun.  How's Mae doing?  She's done.  Mae?  You're out, Mae?  Yeah.  All right.  By the way, the guys had to continue drinking double shots of eggnog during that whole mess.  So let's see where we're at.  We lost Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy that we're going to hire for an intern.  Awesome.  And I guess we lose our only female competitor, Mae, there. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, Mae, you're out, huh?  All right.  All right.  Guys.  Can't take all the sugar.  All right.  That hairdo is awful.  Jimmy, do you mind if they stand over here to check out the rest of the game?  Magoo is teetering?  No.  I thought when she bent over to puke, it was going to fall off.  All right.  As long as they stand back a little bit.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Where are we at?  Magoo is teetering.  He's got to get that shot down.  We're up to the 24th double shot of eggnog.  Sergeant Magoo is making his way to the bucket.  All right. 
[01:10:00]  He has a pitcher in his hand.  He's trying.  The bar has been raised so high now.  Yeah.  That was amazing.  That was all in him?  I couldn't believe it.  I know.  It kept coming like that.  It just.  That was like what?  Like 11?  I think he puked up every shot that he drank.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Individually.  Yeah, individually.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Someone's got to count that for us.  I think he puked like 10 to 12 individual times there.  They were all gems.  They were all doozies.  Wait till you see the video of that one.  I want that to replace my old puke sound effects. 
[01:10:30]  People are going to be confused.  They're going to go, that guy had to have been one of the last guys standing.  What do we got?  Magoo.  Sog and Magoo, how are you feeling?  I'm feeling a little queasy.  All right.  How many?  Shot.  Shot.  There we go.  Another one.  What are we up to?  Chit chat.  All right, guys.  This is the 25th double shot of eggnog in the eggnog drinking contest.  What's the record?  71.  71.  71.  Magoo put that one right down. 
[01:11:00]  Oh.  Oh.  He's puking.  He's puking into the pitcher.  And now you can measure it.  Oh, my God.  He's going to fill it.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  It's getting chunky.  Look at the guy turning his back.  He doesn't want to see it.  No.  Oh, my God.  He's filling up the pitcher. 
[01:11:30]  Pitcher's full.  Oh, and the rest of them have to continue drinking.  I think we're done with the puke.  Oh, my God.  Look at all that.  That almost made me puke.  He filled, completely filled up a huge beer pitcher.  I'm not looking.  All right, here's the deal.  We're going to take a quick break. 
[01:12:00]  When we get back, Sergeant Magoo, he's got a pitcher full of puke.  He's got the Froot Loops.  They're opening up the Froot Loops.  He's going to do a little thing for everybody, a little side thing for everybody.  It's the eggnog drinking contest.  They have done 25 double shots.  They're up to 26 as we take a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll be back with more of the 2006 Eggnog Challenge.  For photos and videos of this event, go to opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm loving it.  The eggnog drinking contest, number three. 
[01:12:30]  I forgot about the bad part of this.  What's the bad part?  The smell.  Dude, I had to put up a paper towel and then, like, spray it with Lysol, and I'm holding it up to my nose.  It's not a crime scene.  It smells like one.  Anthony, do you want to sip out of that pitcher that Magoo filled?  Shut up.  Magoo filled a pitcher, and I'm telling Anthony in the break that, wait, don't drink it yet.  Yeah, don't.  We got to do the big setup for this.  If you swallowed some of that, it would be warm like his stomach.  But I guarantee you there's a cool spot in there, like, where the stuff that just went down and his stomach didn't even warm. 
[01:13:00]  You'd suck it down like an oyster.  A cool, like, clot of nog from his stomach would slide down your throat.  I think I'm having more fun.  You look like he's about to puke.  Dude, Joe, by the end of this, we have literally, like, 20, 25 people in this room.  By the end of this, there's going to be a lot of people puking.  I'm having more fun watching Anthony get a little freaked out by this whole thing.  I hate this.  Eric almost threw up.  Eric almost threw up when Sergeant Magoo was filling up the pitcher. 
[01:13:30]  I almost puked, too, I admit.  Did you?  You know what it was?  It's the visual of filling up something that is supposed to be sanitary.  Let me give the big setup.  We got a guy getting close to puking here.  It's the Eggnog Drinking Contest.  These guys have been drinking double shots of Eggnog every single minute.  When you puke, you're out.  We're down to six contestants.  I think we're going to get our...  Oh, double puke.  Down goes full-blown AIDS. 
[01:14:00]  Down goes full-blown AIDS.  It's just as good coming back up.  Oh, no.  We just lost two competitors.  The cocky nose.  Shane.  Oh.  Take that finger down.  There goes Doug Outthug.  Doug Outthug is out of the competition.  Oh, no.  Shane's going.  Shane's going.  Pulse alarm.  Shane's...  Wow, Shane's...  Oh, there goes Shane.  Wow.  He got a running start with that one. 
[01:14:30]  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Out of the nose.  Look at Budaki.  He's like John Madden of Puking.  He's just doing the color commentating.  Oh, wow.  And the other guys have to do a shot.  All right.  Hold on.  We lost two, maybe three guys there?  Three.  Growing up...  We just lost three guys.  Three guys right there.  We lost Doug Outthug.  Doug, who else did we lose?  Shane and John.  Shane and John.  What shot was that?  That was the 30-second double shot of eggnog. 
[01:15:00]  We got three guys left in the competition here.  Shane was a victim of the other two guys' puking.  He said that those two guys' puking made him puke.  Right.  He was facing the wall.  Yep.  Like at the end of Blair Witch.  And other people were puking.  Wait, there's only three guys left?  Three guys left.  We came back from break with six guys, and right away we lost three of them.  Pat, the big...  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Oh!  Oh! 
[01:15:30]  What happened there?  I missed it.  It came out of his nose.  It came out of his nose?  It came out of his nose.  Oh!  Oh!  And Doug's not done yet.  Doug's vomiting more.  And Doug's now vomiting more.  I have to see him.  They had warm-ups really paid off this week, didn't they?  Shane was just wiping off his forehead.  That's how much it's sprayed out.  Wow.  He power-booted through his nose there, Joe.  You heard it.  It was like...  Yeah.  It was like a horse that just won the derby.  All right, no surprise. 
[01:16:00]  We're down to three competitors, and it's the three biggest guys in the competition.  Pat from Manaki.  Who's it?  Generoso?  Tell him I do him proud.  You're in the...  Oh.  More pukey going.  Wow.  From some of the guys that are out of the competition.  Oh, really?  He's coming out of his nose.  Coming out of his nose.  Oh, my God.  He goes out as much his nose as it does his mouth.  And then what do we got over there?  Are you all right?  I'm good.  All good.  I'm all good.  Yeah, the 6'6", 460-pound dude is doing fine, too.  Yeah, Jerry doesn't even look nervous.  And so what is it? 
[01:16:30]  Jerry Generoso and Pat from Manaki left in the competition.  Hey, anybody want to make 20 bucks and just take a sip out of Sergeant Magoo's pitcher?  Yes.  A nice warm sip.  Well, where is Sergeant Magoo?  He promised us a little thing here.  All right, you guys are cool, right?  All right, we're going to let the guys continue with the eggnog drinking contest.  That's 33, 34?  That's 35.  35.  See how fast this goes?  All right, they're up to 35 double shots of eggnog.  Sergeant Magoo, the mic is yours there. 
[01:17:00]  Yes, sir.  So what do you want to do today?  Well, I know what I'm here to make Joe Rogan puke, maybe.  Joe, what do you think?  It's going to take a lot.  I've got a nice little pitcher here of eggnog, which I regurgitated.  Yeah.  So I figure maybe put in a little bowl of Froot Loops and we'll enjoy breakfast together.  I see the nice bowl of Froot Loops there on the table.  It needs just a little milk substance.  Oh, no.  A milky substance in there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God damn it.  No. 
[01:17:30]  Holy Jesus.  No, it's pouring like molasses.  No, Anthony, it's pouring like rice pudding.  It's rice pudding or pancake batter.  Thick pancake batter.  Oh, we might lose E-Rock.  E-Rock is losing it over there.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, did you see that pour?  Turn around, E-Rock.  Get on the mic.  Oh, God.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, he's eating Froot Loops out of his own vomit.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, you all right?  I didn't know eggnog could clot.  Oh, my God. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, there goes E-Rock.  E-Rock, stop puking.  Oh, an innocent bystander gets hit by a straight dog.  Yeah.  Let's make this perfectly clear.  Yes, E-Rock is not in the eggnog drinking contest.  He's one of our own.  He's just puking because he just saw Sergeant Magoo eating the Froot Loops with his own.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock looks worse than anybody in the competition.  E-Rock is so pale right now, and his eyes are running with water. 
[01:18:30]  E-Rock, look at how thick that is.  Magoo, do that again.  E-Rock, you got to look.  Oh, look, look, look.  Watch, watch, watch.  Oh, it's like snot.  Here goes E-Rock.  I almost puked.  Did you?  I had to walk away.  I had to walk away.  You almost puked.  For E-Rock.  If I hadn't.  Oh, no. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, we lost Generoso.  Generoso.  We just lost Generoso for WackBag.com.  Sergeant Magoo is taking everybody out of the competition.  Oh, Magoo is carpet bombing.  Magoo's like a suicide bomber.  He really is.  Poor E-Rock.  Look at that.  Oh, look.  They're all stuck together.  It's like oyster crackers.  Magoo, why don't you top off the Froot Loops with a little more what you got in the picture  there.  How does it take? 
[01:19:30]  Eric is in the garbage.  Eric is puking off a storm.  His stupid headphones are still on.  God, that is hilarious.  Take us to break, stupid.  Oh, my God.  That is hilarious.  Are you all right, Eric?  Look, he's going to top off.  Eric, watch him pour it.  Look, watch him pour it.  Just watch him pour it.  Look.  Look how thick.  Oh, he's in the garbage. 
[01:20:00]  What children?  P-Rock is puking.  He's all the way in the garbage can.  I almost lost it.  Look at it hanging off the spoon.  Look at it hanging off the spoon.  Oh, God.  It's like snot.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Sergeant Magoo continues to eat the Froot Loops with his own eggnog puke mixture that he poured  from a pitcher.  Oh, adding more sugar.  Oh, wow.  A guy like that on Fear Factor could have cleaned up, man. 
[01:20:30]  Wow.  If you haven't had Fear Factor, you can eat your own puke.  What's going to stop you?  Oh, look at Eric's.  He's got snot.  Oh, Eric's a mess.  He really is, Jimmy.  Poor young hawk.  Magoo, hold that under his face a little bit.  Give him something.  What happened to Iroch?  I threw up my nose.  You threw up your nose?  Out of his nose.  Out of his nose.  Do you want to eat it?  No.  Iroch is a mess.  He certainly is.  This is the most disgusting eggnog drinking contest we've ever had.  We might not set a record.  We're down only two guys at this point.  Oh, God. 
[01:21:00]  Look, there's strings in it.  Oh, there's strings that are connected.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Iroch, look at it.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Every time Sergeant Magoo pours a little more into his Froot Loops, Iroch loses it.  Where is that stupid Bob Kelly?  Oh, would I be kidding?  Jesus.  Oh, Bob Kelly would be puking like crazy.  I invite him, but orgasms in Washington.  We invite him, but he's got it.  All right.  We've got to get somebody else to take one sip out of Magoo's picture.  Someone has to do it.  Oh, Jesus.  Iroch's got a stomach like Karen Carpenter. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Let's get back to the competition, Ant.  We got Pat from Minaki, and what's his name, Jerry?  I can't really see his name tag.  Jerry, right?  We got two guys left in the eggnog drinking contest.  Of course, Pat from Minaki, who comes into this competition as the favorite.  And very cocky.  And record holder at 71 double shots that he did last year.  Jerry, how are you holding out?  I'm doing perfect.  Doing perfect.  Pat, how about you?  I'm right in front of them eating.  Oh, I'm just wonderful. 
[01:22:00]  You're wonderful.  Pat, any ill effect at all?  Can I have some of that when you're done?  You're not going to throw Pat.  Yeah, Pat's not fazed.  Sergeant McGoo's trying to eat the Fruit Loop puke mixture right in front of Pat.  Sure.  And Pat has no problem with it.  God, that is so heinous.  By the way, Joe, Pat from Minaki, a diabetic.  Oh.  He has nine toes.  He has nine toes.  And he's taking in all this sugar today.  But he's a diabetic, and he's taking in all that sugar.  He does get rid of it at the end of the contest.  Yeah, it'll be gone soon enough.  And let me tell you, hearing him let go of all this eggnog, it's like putting on Sergeant 
[01:22:30]  Peppers for the first time.  It's magic to your ears, what you will hear.  Dude, it's why I'm here today.  I listened to it for a year.  It was the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Pat puking is the showstopper.  It really is.  Well, I've heard it.  I've heard it on the radio, but I think seeing it.  It's like the Hollywood sound effect.  It's so perfect.  Yeah.  We got guys in there who couldn't get in there. 
[01:23:00]  A lot of guys drove from a long distance and couldn't get in here because it was too  much of a mess.  Oh, Steve.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's going to puke.  No.  Can we get one of those guys in here?  Like, I want to chip in some money and get somebody.  Yeah, I'll get it.  I want somebody.  Hey, we got money.  Don't do it.  Who are you?  He's intern, guy.  This intern will eat Magoo's puke.  How much can we give him?  Oh, my God.  What are we, you're not going to?  What are we, communists?  All right.  I'm in for 20.  I chip in 100.  Jimmy's got a bid going.  Wait, we got someone else that wants to do it over there.  They're getting more people. 
[01:23:30]  I smell puke if people are walking by.  I do it 100, so.  Yeah, it's really disgusting, the smell in here.  Yeah, it's gross.  Jimmy, the competition should be they got to try to keep it down.  If they don't keep it down, we go to the next guy and the money goes up.  Okay.  That's what I say we do.  Fair enough.  That's what I say we do.  Maybe I should take back 50, you know, now that I'm thinking of my bravado.  No, thanks.  It's all good.  You know, it's all fun and games.  Jimmy throws down 100.  Everybody comes over.  I know.  All right.  Where are we at?  How many double shots of eggnog are we up to?  Jimmy Trump.  That'll be 42. 
[01:24:00]  All right, Anthony, they're doing their 42nd double shot of eggnog on their way, hopefully,  to a new record.  Yes, Sarge, I see it.  Believe me.  He's holding up the pitcher like, look, puke.  Yeah, I know.  Magoo is a good boy.  He is a good boy.  He's a good boy.  He has really added a whole new element to this.  Yeah.  He took out, like, three guys because...  Yeah, it worked for the show.  Yeah, they were looking at it as they're trying to drink the eggnog.  They probably could have gotten a few more shots.  I'm not saying they would have won or not, but Magoo definitely cramped their style. 
[01:24:30]  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Did Steve see that?  What?  Steve didn't see that.  Steve, you've got to see the viscous puke in the pitcher.  You're a tough guy.  Pour it on the Froot Loops.  Come on, Steve.  You're a tough guy.  And then watch Sergeant Magoo eat it.  All right, watch this.  Here's our own Steve.  Pour a little on top, Magoo.  Steve, watch.  I can't see it.  Tattoos.  Definitely a tough man.  Yeah.  When he pours this...  Look how this mess pours.  It comes out like rice pudding.  He's pouring it onto another bowl of Froot Loops.  Oh, it's all curdled and sour. 
[01:25:00]  Hawk?  It's the hanger.  Oh, the hanger.  Yeah, there's a hanger on the end of it.  I love it.  I would use the word congealed.  Congealed?  And now he takes his little spoon and his Froot Loops.  I spend a lot of time throwing up after that surgery I had, and this is awful.  And now look, like nothing, he mixes it up.  All right.  He has no problem eating this.  Here he goes.  He's got another spoonful, and there goes Steve.  I don't think E-Rock has any more puke in him at this point.  Oh! 
[01:25:30]  Dude, that's really vile.  He's dropping it.  He's playful.  Magoo is playful.  It's falling on his shirt.  Yeah.  He's like a little boy enjoying it.  It doesn't look as nasty as I thought it would, to be honest.  No?  No, it really doesn't.  Hey, by the way, I've gotten word from one of our pals, Wink Wink, that sits to my left  here, that Kenny cannot handle this.  No, he can't.  Where is Kenny?  We need him for security.  Get Kenny in here.  Kenny, why isn't our security guy in here?  Get Kenny in here.  We don't know half these guys in here.  Look how many people you have.  I want to ask Kenny a question. 
[01:26:00]  All right, Bill Burr, yes.  Is he in the other room?  Tell him to bring his food in.  He needs to come in here.  I just want to ask him a question.  Yeah.  Yes, Bill.  He actually requested that I stay in here, and he...  Really?  No.  Kenny has to come in here.  Here comes Kenny.  20 years on the force.  The smell is really thick in this room, huh?  Yeah.  Kenny.  Between the...  We need you here.  Lysol.  We feel threatened.  All right.  Hey, wait.  Let's get to Kenny.  Kenny's over here.  Come on to Kenny.  You guys don't realize how bad this room smells compared to the rest of the building.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  I can't even tell.  I swear.  I'm not smelling anything yet.  It's awful. 
[01:26:30]  I smell it.  And I just finished eating my breakfast, too.  Can you just take a look at this, Kenny?  Why don't you watch the show?  Watch Magoo.  This is Sergeant Magoo.  Yeah, get Kenny a mic.  Magoo.  That is a pitcher full of vomit.  No, get Kenny over there.  You know who's worse than me?  Roland is complaining in the other room.  Get Roland in here.  He's right here.  He threw him to the dogs.  What a tattletale.  Get Roland.  Kenny, where are you going?  You can't leave.  Kenny, stay in here.  Come on, man.  You don't even have to torture him. 
[01:27:00]  He just immediately told where the platoon was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You ratted him out.  Two clicks to the ring.  I don't like it, but Roland doesn't like it either.  What a snitch.  Roland, you having a tough time?  Get on a mic.  Just find any mic.  Oh, this is going to be pricey.  Yeah, I just had breakfast, too, and I was like, oh.  Really?  Did you see Magoo pour it?  No.  All right.  Watch Magoo.  All right.  Get Roland a mic.  Explain to Roland what that is.  Yeah, get Roland a mic.  He's in front of Sergeant Magoo now.  Magoo's been out of the contest. 
[01:27:30]  A lot of the people puke into the buckets, but Magoo chose to puke into that beer pitcher,  which he is now pouring on Froot Loops.  Watch how it pours.  That was eggnog moments ago.  It is now a bile-y mess.  Oh, he's drinking.  Roland's drinking Coke.  Coke trying to.  Oh, look at that hanger.  Now it's like pouring like yogurt.  It's not even rice pudding anymore.  God, it's hardening.  It's really starting to conceal.  And now he will.  Watch this.  Watch this, Roland.  He mixes up the Froot Loops. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Come on, Roland.  Get a nice eyeful.  Come on, Roland.  Here we go.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's for the competition.  No!  Oh!  All right.  Let me explain.  Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy that we're going to hire as an intern.  He's out of the competition, obviously.  Sergeant Magoo has been eating his own Froot Loops puke combination.  Now, Sergeant Magoo gave the concoction to Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy,  so now he's eating Sergeant Magoo's puke on Froot Loops. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, my God.  Eric's about to go again.  Oh, there goes E-Rock.  Shh, shh, shh, shh.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Oh, there goes E-Rock.  E-Rock is puking again.  He certainly is.  And he has nothing to do with this competition.  We're finding the weak stomachs among us.  Look at Bill Burr, not looking so good.  Bill, you all right?  I'm all right, I'm all right.  What happened, Bill?  Did you see that?  Did you watch that, Bill?  What got you?  The fact that he's eating someone else's puke?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was too much.  Hey, where's Club Soda Kenny?  He's right there.  Kenny's here.  Hey, wait a minute. 
[01:29:00]  Hey, would somebody take, now that picture is so awful,  would somebody take a sip out of it, like without the Froot Loops?  Just a sip.  Just a nice, thick, yogurty sip.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Eric's down.  E-Rock's down.  E-Rock's down again.  Wait, we've got to explain, because it's just noise for people out there.  The intern took a big, mouthful sip out of Magoo's picture of thick, viscous-y vomit.  He took a Viking swig. 
[01:29:30]  Passed up, he's that kid's an animal.  A Viking swig.  And it spilled over his cheeks and chin, ran down his shirt, and splattered on the floor.  That was a victory battle swig.  He just conquered this town and celebrated with Magoo's arms.  The government needs to follow that dude around.  Dude, this kid started as a listener, a competitor, now he's an intern.  By the end of the show, you're going to be like a co-host of this show.  And E-Rock, of course, puked again when that happened.  You get E-Rock's job, by the way.  He's got someone else's puke from his mouth on his own shoes. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Dude, but did we explain that he just poured the whole pitcher?  He tipped the pitcher into his mouth, and a half it went into his mouth, which he swallowed.  Half it went onto his chin and his beard.  After he ate Magoo's puke with Froot Loops on it.  My dad's listening.  My dad's listening.  You raised a tough son of a bitch, sir.  Hey, keep it off the rug.  Keep it off the rug.  You should be proud.  You should be proud.  You should be a Marine.  Yeah, it got right on the edge of the tarp.  All right, let's get back to the competition.  It's Pat from Menachie and Jerry. 
[01:30:30]  Where are you going, Hawk?  We only got two guys left in the eggnog drinking contest.  How many shots are we up to?  You have to go back to the days of, like, Attila the Hun to find that kind of disgusting Roman puke rooms.  Just look at E-Rock's face.  Look how he's sad and red, yet pale.  His throat hurts.  It's coming out his nose, and his eyes are all watery and teary.  You look like a basset hound.  You look like Hulk Hogan just walked away from you. 
[01:31:00]  Hey, I got to ask Joe Rogan.  Are you impressed?  I mean, you've seen it all on Fear Factor.  Are you impressed with this, or what?  I'm very impressed with the drinking of the puke.  It's unprecedented.  I've never seen anything like that.  I bow down.  I bow down to Pat Duffy.  All right, right on.  Pat Duffy.  Holy mother of Jesus.  And he didn't puke after he did it?  No.  Huh?  Well, we got another kid.  You guys want to do the same thing?  What'd you say?  This guy's saying he can top what he did? 
[01:31:30]  No, he said he can't top that.  Oh, you can't top that.  All right.  How about the guy with the beard, the Nirvana shirt?  We recognize him.  Can you top that?  Do you think you could drink that?  The beard is going to be a nice touch.  The beard?  Yep.  It drooling down the beard.  Do you think you could?  It really looks like a fake beard, doesn't it?  Do you think you could top drinking?  Oh, he's stepping in the other guy's puke.  He's in the puke now.  He's stepping in it.  Do you think you could top drinking that puke out of that beer pitcher?  Can I top it?  If you gargle it.  I have no idea.  Can you do it? 
[01:32:00]  Who can't gargle?  You know what we should do?  We should fill up two cups and see who could drink an entire cup.  One or the other.  A chugging contest?  Yeah.  You're out?  No, I got it.  I'm in.  He's an animal, Joe.  He's an animal.  He's already done it.  You're a rookie.  I think we can get somebody to pee in a cup and drink out of it.  I think we can get somebody to drink somebody else's pee.  I could see that happening.  Yeah, I don't think that'll go through.  I don't think that'll make it.  Yeah, no, no, no. 
[01:32:30]  Is it happening with the air competition in this room?  Yeah, well, speaking of the air in this room.  I think pee is a step down from...  Enough about the pee!  Stop!  None of it's making it.  None of it's making the radio.  Let's just say no fluid is as vile as vomit.  I don't think vomit's the worst you can get.  Oh, my God.  All right, listen.  Okay.  There was a lot of dumping that had to be done there.  Okay, we're back to the competition.  We're at to what?  51.  51.  Now, I'm seeing Jerry.  Jerry and Pat from Unaki.  Jerry's taking some deep breaths.  Yeah, I'm getting a little shaky. 
[01:33:00]  You get a little shaky.  Pat from Unaki, how are you holding up?  I'm fine.  Pat is fine.  He's unshakable.  Pat is amazing.  Unaki is unshakable.  An amazing athlete, I like to call him.  High-level athlete.  Yes.  Yeah.  Next year, we've got to do this.  Jerry's sweating.  We've got to do this in front of an audience, man.  You're looking a little pale, and I'm seeing like this almost spasmatic, like you're ready  to puke.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Sergeant Magoo has poured out the big cups of puke.  Magoo is a good pourer.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Wow. 
[01:33:30]  I almost gagged.  It's like this.  Sweaty.  It came very close.  It's like there's seaweed in there.  Look at Eric.  He won't look up.  It looks like curdled vanilla pudding.  Good call.  Curdled vanilla pudding.  Yeah.  All right.  Here it is.  Two equal cups full of eggnog, Bobbitt.  Jerry, don't look at this, bro.  God, it's not.  Brother, don't look at this.  I want you in this competition a little longer.  Holy Jesus.  All right.  We got the two guys still.  Is this a clean cup?  Hold on.  Here's the deal.  We got the two guys still in the eggnog drinking contest officially.  We got a clean cup.  We got three rings happening here. 
[01:34:00]  It's like a circus.  We got these two guys on the side.  They're going to drink a cup of eggnog, right?  Mm-hmm.  First one.  Eggnog puke.  Eggnog puke.  What's the deal?  The guy who finished first wins the money?  Jimmy, it's your thing.  I think so, yeah.  I don't care.  Whoever wants it now.  Whoever finishes it first?  Wait.  Whoever finishes first?  No, no, no.  Because there might be more puke to be drunk.  I mean, we don't want anybody rushing.  Just enjoy it.  So what's the â€“ who wins?  Who wins?  I don't know.  We need some rules here.  We need some rules.  How about nobody? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, I don't think there's any â€“  Whoever turns this show off wins.  I think they ought to have a chug contest.  Whoever can chug it and hold it wins.  If they both do it, they got to do another cup.  Oh, my God.  This is insane.  Another eggnog puke challenge.  I say gargle.  I want to hear somebody gargle.  Jerry's rumbling.  Jerry.  I'll gargle it.  All right, what's your name, by the way, Nirvana guy?  Drew.  Drew, what's up?  He looks like he's in the spin doctors. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Someone else's vomit.  That was a long time listener.  First time puke her.  That was your chance.  This is really tough.  I've never had this tough a time.  Nope.  Than's unflappable, too.  Nothing bothers Than.  He's just standing there, tent in his pants.  He doesn't care.  I've been fine with everything so far.  So far.  Got his Paul R. Nelson shirt on.  Show off.  Than is unflappably psychotic.  So I say someone's got a gargle with that puke.  Why not?  I mean, it'd be cute.  Drew?  Jesus, Jim.  Oh, whoa. 
[01:35:30]  He just gargled Sergeant Magoon's puke.  All right.  That got a little too close.  Did they make a mouthwash for that?  Yes, they did.  It's called a bullet.  By the way, HDNet is filming this whole thing.  Okay.  That got a little too close.  That splatter got a little too close.  A little speck got on my chair.  This must be eliminated immediately, or I will leave the program.  Drew?  It tastes like vomit.  What does it taste like?  What does it taste like, Drew?  It tastes like eggnog. 
[01:36:00]  Warm eggnog.  Warm eggnog.  But there's clumps in it.  Dude, there's clumps.  It was warmed up in a man's stomach.  All right, we got the intern, Pat, Duffy.  Hold on.  Jerry's raising his hand over there.  Jerry?  It's a matter of, Jerry.  I thought it was for a second.  What?  I thought it was for a second.  All right.  What shot are we up to?  We're getting close.  Dan, how many shots are we up to?  54.  All right.  The guys that are still in the competition, it's only two.  Pat from Minaki and Jerry.  They're about to do their 54th double shot. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, they're going to do 55 right now.  All right.  Their 55th double shot of eggnog.  I think Gary's doing the rope for a dope.  Yeah.  We're getting close to the record now.  Pat, how many more do you think you can do?  A few.  Uh-oh.  There goes Jerry.  Just put his down.  Pat's eating less because he's losing weight for his girl.  So Pat's not in quite.  He's not in shape.  Not in this kind of shape.  He's becoming in better everyday shape.  Yeah.  Settle down, Pat.  Find yourself a nice girl and settle down. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Where's your girl there, Pat?  You don't know, do you?  Uh-oh.  I'm going to puke.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Everyone, this is the big guy, Jerry.  Here comes the bison.  Shh.  Oh.  It's like he's sneezing through his mouth.  Can't get it done.  It doesn't want to come out.  Did he technically puke?  Yep.  Yeah, we got a winner, actually. 
[01:37:30]  Somebody, uh...  What a different sound.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  All right, here it comes now.  Does this mean I won?  Magoo's holding the thing under.  Hold the pitch under, Magoo.  Magoo, you got to catch some of it? 
[01:38:00]  Yep.  Puking to the pitcher, sir.  Jerry is still over the barrel.  Not much has come out, considering how much he's got in him.  There's a lot of effort.  It felt like a golf match.  Oh, there he goes.  Oh, he's puking into the other thing of puke.  He's adding to Sergeant Magoo's pitcher.  Wow.  This is so heinous. 
[01:38:30]  This is so bad.  You know what's funny?  The pitcher was so heinous that him puking didn't even faze me.  I don't know.  His puke is different.  Yeah.  There's something about it.  It looks like white cheddar cheese puff.  It's, yeah.  It's thicker.  It's a cottage cheesy thing.  Yeah, it's had time to really, like, solidify in his stomach.  Yeah, the water has gone through different pipes and left the solid.  Some body chemicals have been added.  Look, look, look, look.  Oh, God. 
[01:39:00]  I like how he's enticing him with it.  Yeah.  The best part about this is Pat isn't even remotely fazed.  No.  How are you feeling, Pat?  Jerry.  I'm feeling pretty damn good.  Jerry?  All right, here's the deal.  Jerry is the runner-up in the eggnog drinking contest.  Pat from Menaki gets his title back.  And not only that, he just finished the shot.  He never had to.  Right.  He didn't have to finish it, but he just chugged down.  And he's refilling his cup.  Look at him go.  Hey, Pat, you going to go for the record or no? 
[01:39:30]  Uh, I already won.  Did I mention I was diabetic?  Pat, do you have a grand finale in you?  Hmm, funny you say grand.  Uh, wow.  Yeah, where's the money coming from?  Do we have to promote anybody or is it just cold, hard cash?  Ooh.  From just the radio station?  Free FM here in New York?  With Tanya.  Huh?  With that. 
[01:40:00]  You going to take Tanya on a date?  Yeah.  Buy us something nice?  Drive for a master post somewhere.  Hey, let's go to the phones.  Pat, what are you going to do?  You want to go for the record or no?  Sure, what the hell?  All right, Pat's going to go for the record.  All right.  Ah, let's say hi to Pete in the Bronx.  Pete, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  What's going on?  Hey.  Oh, my God.  I thought my window was open and I threw up all over the goddamn car.  Yeah, this is great, man. 
[01:40:30]  All right, thanks.  It's one of those tough shows.  Larry on the island.  It really is tough.  Larry.  What's going on?  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  What's up?  I'm driving my truck on Sunrise Highway and I look to my left and I see this chick and  she's listening to the show.  She has to be.  It looks like she's gagging and making all these messed up faces.  I look to my right and I can see this dude in a truck and I know he's listening and he's  laughing his ass off.  Classic radio.  Unbelievable.  I'm loving it.  It's been unbelievable today.  Let's go to Boston.  Zach, what's up? 
[01:41:00]  Zach.  All right, I love Zach.  Let's go to Brandon in Cleveland.  Brandon.  Oh, that is, I was fine up until Jimmy started explaining it.  And the Viking swig, I had the burps and I had to run to the kitchen listening to you  guys on direct TV.  Oh.  And I say the money has to go.  I say that, would the young intern gargle with the other man's vomit?  I say you get the money.  Absolutely.  This kid, nothing fazes him. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, he's a tough competitor.  Just be careful you don't throw up on the walk-in.  The only way to top this would be if someone put their head over the bucket with an open  mouth and let Pat from Wunaki throw up in their mouth.  Joey!  That's why Joe Rogan is here.  That's the next level, people.  Let's not make this happen next year.  Let's make it happen this year.  What do you say?  Well, Pat's going to...  See that?  That's all those years from all those great pitch meetings.  That's all those experiences.  That's right.  It's a wonderful episode.  Human water fountain.  Well, Pat's going to have to get rid of what he's got in his belly because he's a diabetic. 
[01:42:00]  So how many shots is Pat up to?  60.  60?  If we can get someone to just lean back, put the head over the bucket with an open mouth.  Who's going to lean back?  Can I catch it with this cup and drink?  No, no, no, no.  Right open mouth.  Well, we have to go to...  Eric can hold you up.  Wow, we got to take a break?  You want to take a break now?  Pat, do you think you can do that?  Open mouth?  You got good aim?  Pat, can you hold out for five minutes before you puke?  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  How many minutes do you got to do?  This is going to be the most disgusting thing ever.  Like he's ever done this before.  Sure. 
[01:42:30]  Pat, how close are you to puking?  I'm pretty good right now.  You can hold out for a few minutes?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Pat's a pro.  All right, here's the deal.  Pat's going to go for the record.  We're going to take a quick break, and we'll continue with the O.P. and Anthony show.  I guess when we get back, it's the showstopper that Joe came up with.  Pat's going to have to get rid of this.  He won the eggnog drinking contest, and he's going to get rid of it as the new intern dude  is over the bucket, right?  Pat Duffy.  Other Pat.  Pat Duffy.  All right, cool.  We'll do that next.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:43:00]  We'll be back with more of the 2006 Eggnog Challenge.  For photos and videos of this event, go to opiananthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  O.P. and Anthony.  All right.  We're back for the grand finale of the eggnog drinking contest.  If you're just joining in, Pat Fumunaki has won the eggnog drinking contest, getting his  title back.  He's won two out of the three competitions.  He's going for the record, which stands at 71 double shots of eggnog that he set last  year. 
[01:43:30]  And what else is going on, Anthony?  We got the new intern.  Yeah, the new intern.  Pat.  Pat.  What's his last name?  Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Yeah.  Pat Duffy.  Soon to be legend.  And yeah, he is soon to be a legend in this competition because he has volunteered to let  Pat Fumunaki, who has had how many shots?  67.  67 shots.  He is four shots away from tying the eggnog drinking contest record. 
[01:44:00]  Earlier, Sergeant Magoo, as we know, puked into a beer pitcher, poured it into a bowl  of Froot Loops and ate it, which is really disgusting.  And so did, yeah.  Pat.  Pat, our new intern.  He did that.  Step by step.  Ate some of the Froot Loops.  But now he has volunteered with a little bit of prodding to letting...  If he wants a job as an intern on the show, he's going to do this.  Yeah, to letting Pat Fumunaki unload his vomit into his mouth directly. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, because Pat has to get rid of this because he's a diabetic.  Yeah, he's a diabetic.  Now, he's going to kneel.  I would say you should get into a position shortly where you kneel on the tarpaulin and  lean the head back over the garbage can because you don't want to be balanced.  You don't want to fall back and break your neck.  Do we have a table?  I think...  What about that little stool there?  A good stool.  Good point.  Like in Max Hardcore?  Can he sit on that and then...  Is that tall enough?  Yep.  Can he lean his throat back? 
[01:45:00]  Hey, I got to use that.  Is that stool good?  Put the stool against there.  See if he could sit on that and lean his head back like he's at the dentist.  Yeah, because he can't be the back of the head.  He's got...  Yeah.  That could be perfect size.  Okay, that works perfectly.  Yeah, like he's having his hair shampooed.  There you go.  Yeah.  Hey, Sam.  Sam.  Did you shoot from that angle?  Yeah, shoot from another angle because if we don't get a view of this, I'm going to be pissed.  This is like watching Haley's Comet.  Oh, you missed it.  You know, you're not going to see this again.  Sam, get in position.  Yeah.  HD net, get in position. 
[01:45:30]  Pat from Monaki, how many shots have you done?  Oh, God.  This is actually also like flash dance.  Yeah.  That scene where he pulls the little handle and the water goes all over him, but it certainly won't be water.  Yeah, you get one later.  All right, wait, where are we at?  Where's Pat at?  Pat, 68.  You really think this is, you're really going to be able to do this, man?  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah, I'll do it.  You're going to let a dude throw up in your mouth.  Yeah.  Sam, how's that camera battery?  Good?  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah, we got like a three camera shoot going on. 
[01:46:00]  By the way, this is called the Baby Bird, right?  Than came up with the name?  Yeah, Than came up with the name, the Baby Bird.  The Baby Bird.  Rogan, of course, that sick bastard, came up with the idea.  Yeah.  And he's in position.  For the first time.  Pat's in position.  In radio history, you're about to listen to The Baby Bird.  The Baby Bird.  How about the first time in human history?  Which is?  Now, I think some fraternity did this somewhere.  That's true.  We're making German pornography.  Right.  This is, um... 
[01:46:30]  No, I think he was right the other way.  He's too high in the air now.  Yeah, don't be all silly.  It's all right, because some's going to get on the tarp.  We have a tarp.  We have a tarp.  It's fine.  Pat, how many shots are you up to?  69.  69.  Pat is very close to the eggnog drinking contest record.  Okay, I'm feeling it, though.  You feeling it?  Yeah.  Feeling that pressure.  Feeling a little nausea?  All right.  We got the new intern, Pat, in position, Pat Duffy.  This is going to be incredible.  And, uh, Danny, could you mic him from the other side? 
[01:47:00]  Without getting to Sam's way to...  We got to film it properly.  Yeah.  We got to film it properly.  Sam, you miss this, you die.  Yeah.  This is very important.  Don't go for art.  Go for documentary.  Yeah, exactly.  HD, you should get over there, too, just in case.  I think I'm close enough.  You're going to be all right?  Yeah.  This guy, the cameraman's not into the whole puke thing, but he's filming it for HD now.  But, you know, sometimes you got to...  It's like a war correspondent.  I understand.  You don't want to see it, but you're there, and you have to document what happened.  All right, a lot of things going on. 
[01:47:30]  Pat, what shot you got in your hand now?  This is to tie the record right here, guys.  How you doing?  He's taking his time.  It's rough, huh, Pat?  He's rolling this one over.  Pat, do it for love.  He's going to tell me when to go.  Oh, Pat's ready.  Oh, fuck.  The shot.  All right, this ties the Eggnog Drinking Contest record.  Pat has officially tied it.  He is one shot away from setting a brand new record here.  And, like a true champion, he's only in competition with himself.  Yeah, only with himself.  He could have stopped. 
[01:48:00]  He won the competition.  He's feeling the pressure.  You could see it on his face.  He's not as confident as he was at the beginning of this.  No.  He is just going for the record, though.  So he can pace himself.  He doesn't have to worry about losing.  And the loneliness of the champion left there standing above.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Also, his belly is really bloated.  Yeah, it is really pushed out.  Because you've lost weight, and you've got a massive belly today.  It's like the Eggnog started.  Now, I would suggest to Pat over here, the new intern, our new favorite intern, Pat, that don't move. 
[01:48:30]  It's just going to make it worse.  Close your eyes.  Your instinct is probably going to be to sit up quickly and get out of the way, but that'll just make it worse.  Just shut your eyes.  Let it happen.  Now, wait, wait.  Where's Pat Fumunaki going to stand?  Because you're waiting.  You've got a whole bunch of guys to stand.  Yeah, Pat, what's your position going to be?  Right there.  Give him, like, a little hair rinse.  Do a dry run.  You've got to get his mouth.  No, the mouth, Pat.  Well, the whole head.  The whole head.  But aim for his mouth. 
[01:49:00]  The record.  The record.  Pat has just set a new record of 72.  72.  Fantastic.  This kid could not be more relaxed.  He's, like, electric.  I know.  His heart rate hasn't even gone up.  Pat, can we have, like, a dry run of what you're going to do?  Let's say you're ready to puke.  What are you going to do?  Brace yourself on the bucket, each hand, on the sides of the bucket, and then right in his mouth.  In the mouth, Pat.  Don't worry about the bucket.  I mean, we've got to calm down. 
[01:49:30]  It's called the baby bird.  He's not gay, Pat.  Pat.  You are the mommy bird coming back to feed the baby bird.  Feed your young.  No baby's hungry.  Pat, just destroy it.  God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's going to destroy him.  Please say that before you do it.  Pat, just destroy his face, man.  We don't care about the mess.  We'll clean up afterwards.  Oh, no.  That's right.  It's Tom's tie.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  73.  73.  Unbelievable.  73 double shots of eggnog. 
[01:50:00]  From Pat Fuminaki.  This is the worst thing ever.  Yeah, this is really, really bad.  He's got that look on his face like those guys in the 80s that were about to fight Tyson.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just that, oh.  Inevitable loss.  Joe Rogan playing Carolines all weekend long.  With the Amazing Racist opening up.  Pat, how are you?  It's getting real close.  All right.  It's getting real close.  The suspense. 
[01:50:30]  All the cameras out.  We've never had more people in the studio, by the way.  There's got to be about 30 people in here.  And what he's doing is very DiMaggio-esque.  This is like the 56-game hitting streak.  Yeah, yeah.  73 shots.  This will never be broken.  Hey, someone is saying, please send her the Paltalk camera.  We got to...  I got mine done.  All right.  No, no.  Mine's fine.  It's Paltalk 2.  All right.  That somebody's in the way of or something like that.  I guess it's the camera guy.  What shot is that?  The last.  74.  Oh, he's going for more.  He's going for 75. 
[01:51:00]  Everyone's got to pretty much keep their position so the cameras and everybody can see.  Yeah, that's fine.  People are calling from all over America.  They've been puking all over the place.  75.  Just about every city in America.  And in Canada, thanks to XM.  He's just drinking now.  He's up to 76.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  Here it goes.  Oh, God.  The baby bird is going down.  The baby bird is happening.  The baby bird is happening.  I can't speak. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  My God.  Oh, my God.  No way.  No way.  No way did that happen.  Oh, my God.  No way did that just happen. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I almost wet myself.  I swear to you, I'm laughing so hard.  We lost Jimmy.  He's laughing so hard he ran into the corner.  Yeah.  You're ready for the race. 
[01:52:30]  A thunderous round of applause.  Down goes Pat.  Down goes Pat.  He's wearing puke blackface.  That was the greatest moment in radio history, period.  It's impossible to top that.  That's impossible.  Trust me on that.  How can you top that?  Trust me on that.  How can that be topped?  We are announcing our retirement right now because that is it.  How can that be topped?  Wow.  Joe. 
[01:53:00]  That can't be topped.  That was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life.  That was insane.  Can you believe you were watching that as it was happening?  Uh-oh.  I cannot believe I saw that.  Worst kid I've ever seen.  Holy.  Jimmy, what happened?  I was filming it on my camera for posterity.  Yeah?  It was like Zapruder.  And as I got a hit, the smell hit me and I almost threw up.  I mean the smell.  Dude, the best part when Pat, our new intern, turned his head sideways to get some of it 
[01:53:30]  off of his face and Pat puked right in his ear.  You know, the best, what about when he opened his eyes and all of a sudden there was just  these two clear dots in the middle of this pancake batter?  Listen.  He keeps going.  He keeps going.  All right, listen.  Oh my God.  I'm watching it on Joe Rogan's camera phone.  Oh my God.  I'm crying.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  Look, look, look.  Here, this one, hold on, Ant.  We got to do this because everyone's asking what the hell happened. 
[01:54:00]  All they heard was the reaction.  So, Pat from Menachie, what shot was that?  The 75th?  He did this 75th.  You got to get that.  Hold on.  Let's do this, Ant.  Oh, the cleanup.  He did his 75th double shot of eggnog because people aren't sure exactly what happened.  Cool.  Okay.  He immediately lost it.  We had Pat Duffy leaning over the bucket and Pat just unloaded everything that was in  his stomach.  I've never seen anyone puke more volume in my life all over Pat Duffy's head. 
[01:54:30]  He's still cleaning off his head.  It's pouring out of his hair still, the puke.  He just shook his head like he got out of a pool, you know, when you have stuff in your  ear.  There was no way to describe it as it was going on because it was the reaction in the  studio was just amazing.  Oh my God.  I defy that clip to not make the number one downloaded clip on YouTube.  We're going for number one download on YouTube.  What the hell are you going to watch that's better than that?  That clip will be up on YouTube, what, within a day? 
[01:55:00]  I'm sending that to my website.  It's going to be at JoeRogan.net in about 10 seconds.  That's got to be.  Yeah.  That has to be online immediately.  It's going right now.  It's going right now.  Brilliant.  Oh, look.  Joe is uploading it as we speak at.  Technology.  JoeRogan.net?  Yeah.  JoeRogan.net.  It'll be up in my phone camera slot section.  Right.  Oh my God.  Wow.  I was watching it like, and it was like, it was an out of body experience because I was  like, I know what it's like now to watch a murder happen. 
[01:55:30]  Dude.  You're watching going, oh my God, this isn't really happening.  All right.  Anthony.  Because people are like, all we heard was you guys screaming.  You got to understand.  It was so unbelievable.  We stepped out of being radio hosts and just watched.  All right.  When I suggested, I did not think he was going to take it out.  I'm telling you right now, and I have been doing radio for 12 plus years.  That is the greatest moment that we've seen in studio.  And we've seen it all.  And we've seen it all.  That he was leaning back, his head over the garbage pail, sitting on a stool like you 
[01:56:00]  would getting your hair shampooed at a salon.  Oh, God.  That's the exact stance he had.  Pat was on the other side where the sink would be, where the faucets would be.  The mama bird side.  Yeah, the mama bird side.  Pat, the intern, mouth opened.  And then Pat from Unaki just let loose a virtual waterfall.  Have you ever seen anyone puke more volume?  No, no.  That was insane.  I can't even describe how much came out of him.  It's uploaded.  It's at JoeRogan.net now. 
[01:56:30]  There's a little section in the upper left-hand corner that says, latest camera phone shot.  It'll be a video.  It'll be on Text America.  Good luck.  You can find it on JoeRogan.net.  Good luck.  You just crashed your site, I'm sure.  I don't care.  Wow.  I got it on my cell phone.  I don't care.  I can't believe I saw that.  Yeah.  Steve, get that video up on OPNF.  And it kept happening and happening.  It wasn't like it happened and then it was done.  Right.  It went on and on and on.  And Pat just, Pat just, and the volume, yeah.  It was more each time until he was completely covered. 
[01:57:00]  The mama bird.  Look at this disgusting, it stinks.  Pat was standing there and he would just open his mouth and it shot out of it.  It almost looked like fake puke.  Like it was being done with a hose.  Like the exercise when she's opening her mouth and puke shot out.  And like Joe said, simple as this.  We just raised a bar.  I guarantee that is the greatest moment in radio history right there as far as just over  the top stuff.  Oh my God.  I guarantee.  When you see this video on YouTube and opianthony.com, you're not going to believe it. 
[01:57:30]  I'm uploading a second video.  I got two videos.  And he never puked himself.  Yeah, you didn't puke, right Pat?  You are a trooper.  Pat Duffy.  He's our new intern.  That dude is a savage.  Give him the money.  It's not much money, but give it to him.  That's his money.  Oh, yeah.  Now that's a way to apply for a goddamn job.  Absolutely.  Oh my God.  You're hired.  He deserves health insurance after that one.  Yeah.  Dental even. 
[01:58:00]  What are your references?  He puts his head back and opens his mouth.  Wow.  A little thing called the baby bird.  Yeah.  You ever hear of the baby bird?  Me.  Greatest moment in radio history?  Yeah.  Wow.  Does it smell over there, Steve?  Steve has puke on him.  Puke on the wires.  There's puke all over me.  It really is.  Is it smelling bad, Hawk?  People are calling it puke-cocky.  Hey, we're going to walk over to XM.  Yeah.  And we have some, the boys will be drinking some eggnog on the way.  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  This young go-getter, Pat Duffy.  Yeah.  Hopefully he won't throw up on the walkover because we'd hate to see that on 57th Street because  that would look really awful.  Yeah.  We'll be filming.  Well, I'm now looking at the text that was coming out of Pal Talk because the people  watching it on the cameras.  And I've never seen so many no's being written ever.  People are just disgusted.  Other people just throwing in random letters like they just slammed their keyboard and hit  send.  You know, they were stunned. 
[01:59:00]  Dude, for the first time, I think the reaction said it all.  I mean, we had over 30, maybe 40 people in studio just losing their minds.  Jimmy, like, I didn't even know where you went.  I stood on the couch and was filming with my own camera.  I fell on the floor.  I was laughing so freaking hard.  I was crying.  I thought I was going to wet myself.  No one else was puking.  They were just...  I got right next to it just to get it on my camera phone.  I didn't even throw up.  I was so transfixed by the moment.  I couldn't believe it was actually happening.  It was like an alien abduction.  You are a trooper, man. 
[01:59:30]  A lot of applause was incredible.  Yeah.  It's called the baby bird.  Thank you, Than, for naming that fine little stunt.  And Rogan for thinking it.  Yeah.  And Pat for being Pat and other Pat for being Pat.  We have two Pats.  Yeah, we got to...  I've got to hear that again when we get over there.  Yeah, we will.  I've got to hear the clip, the sounds.  We got to get out of here early because they got to clean up.  Yeah, they got to clean up.  Get me out of here.  It's...  Yeah, all right.  We got to go, guys.  Thank you so much.  This concludes the 2006 Eggnog Challenge.  For photos and videos, go to opianathony.com or foundrymusic.com. 
[02:00:00]  Hey, it's E-Rock.  Primetime Sam Roberts, former intern Pat Duffy, on the Worst of Opian Anthony,  where we're recapping the 2006 Eggnog Drinking Challenge.  It just ended.  Pat pulled off the impossible with Pat Fumanaki doing the baby bird  in order to secure his internship with this show.  Pat, your thoughts about what was going on right before the event happened?  Right before the actual baby bird?  Yeah.  My only thoughts were that I had to do this right,  so I had to make sure that it looked good for the other people, 
[02:00:30]  and I wasn't quite sure what was going to happen.  And once it started hitting me, I realized that I was not in control of anything,  so I just went along for the...  I went along on the ride of the puke, the cascade.  And to your credit, in a single day, while regardless,  you could have just sent in an application and gotten an internship,  but in a single day, you got name recognition and icon status  from Opie, Anthony, Jim, Joe Rogan.  Bill Burr was there, too.  Bill Burr.  Ari, wasn't Ari there?  Ari Gold was there?  Or Ari Schaefer? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, Ari Gold was there.  He was sitting there.  He gave you a deal right off the bat.  He put you in pictures.  And now you're a big movie star.  I am.  But ever since Aquaman, you haven't done much.  What's that been like?  I don't know.  I don't watch that show.  Yeah, I both can go with you.  So let's jump to the part where it just was completed.  So now you're laying there drenched in regurgitated puke from Papamunaki.  It's in your hair.  It's in your beard.  It's in your mouth, in your eyes.  Thoughts going through your head?  It was freezing cold.  That was my first thought was the eggnog was still freezing cold, 
[02:01:30]  and I just wanted it off of my body as soon as possible.  So what was cleanup like?  What did you have to do?  Cleanup was terrible because nobody around here could get me anything.  I got a stack of paper towels and a free FM towel,  and then I was told to clean up with that,  and I ended up cleaning out Magoo's puke pitcher  and dumping water all over myself with that.  In the studio or in the bathroom?  In the studio.  And I ended up throwing out, like, half the clothes I was wearing.  I ended up walking out there with, like, a 3XL free FM shirt.  So at any point, did you actually come to the realization that this is puke, 
[02:02:00]  or did you have to just say,  all right, my mind has to go someplace else just to make this work?  No, I knew it was puke the whole time,  and I just, like, it's very easy for me to take myself out of a situation mentally.  So I wasn't even really there the whole time.  Now, once all this was done, the studio was being cleaned,  did you have to walk over with us to the XM studio?  Well, you didn't wait for me.  I had to wait outside.  We left you there?  Yeah.  Of course we did.  We were finished with him.  He'd gotten puked on.  He's not going to get any better than that.  What else could I do?  Yeah.  And then I walked over here, yeah. 
[02:02:30]  It was terrible.  Any regrets?  None, other than the entire event in itself.  Yeah.  No, no single regrets.  Just everything.  Just one giant regret.  This whole experience.  Of interning for us?  Of the whole thing.  So for two years, it's been nothing but regret?  No, just until really recently, it's been regret.  When I realized that this wasn't going to pay off,  and it wasn't going to do anything for me in the long run.  It's sort of like peaking in high school,  and the rest of your life is just shit.  Exactly.  You're listening to my peak right now.  You did.  You never came back after that first day. 
[02:03:00]  No, no.  There's nothing else that you would consider a highlight in your career here with the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, I did enjoy, well, nobody even heard about it.  I enjoyed stapling my forehead and going to the hospital with Steve, but no one saw that.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  Exactly.  It never even happened.  Plus, you got to change E-Rock's tire that time.  I did.  Or whatever.  I did.  His battery.  And he was paid for that, and I gave him a ride home.  This is true.  Yes.  What about snorting cockroaches?  That was good.  I was tame, though.  I snorted cockroaches, and then I ate another cockroach, and then I... 
[02:03:30]  You rubbed a homeless man's underwear on your face?  I've had all kinds of shit and other various disgusting forms in and on my body.  But there you have it.  That's the Pat Duffy, Opie and Anthony internship retrospective.  There you go.  That was great.  Thanks for playing one thing.  No problem.  Again, it was your peak.  I did have a few line of the days.  Not that I...  I don't recall.  I don't recall it either.  Don't recall.  Final words, Pat?  Pat, since this is probably your last time with the show, which is sad.  Uh, I just want to say thank you to everybody that ever did anything for me, excluding Sam. 
[02:04:00]  That's fair.  Yeah.  Because, I mean...  You two didn't like each other.  Hmm.  Why did I pick you two to do this interview?  As soon as we went into this, I was like, if this is going to go bad, I'm just going  to leave.  No, I'm professional here.  But just remember, as the great Ron Bennington from Ron and Fez once said, Pat, either you  tell a joke, or you are a joke.  This is true.  And I will forever be the joke.  I hate my life.  Do you want to give us those famous three words?  Uh, your mom's box.  Supposedly I got one of two copies I'm learning.  What? 
[02:04:30]  I don't know.  It was this guy, Dave Rabbit.  He was in Vietnam, and he did an underground radio show.  Oh, is this the guy I just...  And he was smart enough...  Where's Z-Rock?  He's got all the info on the guy, but basically he just was doing underground radio.  He did the show...  In Vietnam?  Vietnam.  Out of a whorehouse, right?  Out of a whorehouse.  It's a back room of a whorehouse.  Here's Z-Rock to just reset the bit.  Go ahead, Dave.  Z-Rock, reset.  Go.  Yeah, just a really interesting guy.  We don't know much about him, but we're finding more info online as we speak. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  He rented out the back room of a whorehouse, built the bedroom into a studio with mattresses  and tile to prevent you hearing sex going on around in the rooms around him, and he would  just broadcast, sometimes illegally, on the Armed Force Radio Network signal, and I was  reading online.  It turns out his show was more popular outside of Vietnam, like in Germany and other European  countries where people were stationed.  They used to trade these tapes around. 
[02:05:30]  So somebody was taping him in Vietnam and then mail him out all throughout the service.  Well, was he like the Good Morning Vietnam guy?  Completely different.  Completely the other side.  Why did I hear?  I just heard about him.  Instead of high energy, he was tripping.  He was high.  He was really mellow, but really witty.  Really funny with the one-liners.  Can we have one?  I want to hear them.  Well, this is the one that we had a bleep on the other side.  I love them.  We have new ones for over here where he talks about, like, hand jobs, blow jobs, the latest  specials that the whorehouse is running.  But here's Dave Rabbit from 1971 in Vietnam. 
[02:06:00]  Guys in the field are just listening to this shit as they're hoping that they're going to  survive another day.  Fuck number 69, James Gang.  Sorry about that yelling and screaming. 
[02:06:30]  But Pete and I are on a trip, and we thought we'd have to get in on that song.  Here's one done by the Biggie, Three Dog Knight.  It's called Mama Told Me Not to Come.  Now, you can take these two ways.  As a title, or your girlfriend's name is Mama.  How great is that?  Wow.  Is that awesome? 
[02:07:00]  1970 or 71.  Yeah.  But in Nam?  Yeah.  In a warehouse?  Yeah.  Which clips do we have to bleep out?  It's amazing.  The lifers are like flies.  That's a funny one, too.  Oh, wait.  This one, we should replay the t-shirt, because they had to bleep the shit out of it today.  Think about it.  Now, how long did it take to come to the surface?  When you think about it.  I mean, it's probably been circulating on tape, and then with the internet.  I've had a copy of this for 20 years.  Have you really?  I found it in a box.  And you don't even know where you got it, do you? 
[02:07:30]  My buddy Stork, who got it from some guy in the Buffalo area, who might have another  tape.  We're hunting it down.  Because if he'd been on, like, let's say it was today, if this was today, and he was  doing this, like two days after he did the first show, it would be around the world.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  It's amazing how this was traded around back in the day.  This is 70.  Yeah, it's extraordinary.  You've got to mail this shit.  Get the postage right and all that crap, instead of pushing a button on your computer.  From Vietnam. 
[02:08:00]  I think we might talk to him tomorrow, we're hoping.  Wow.  Here's one where he was selling.  He got so popular, he had stuff he was selling.  This is a sweatshirt.  He was selling stuff.  Yeah, he was a marketing genius, too.  Pinball Wizard by The Who.  I've had quite a few letters recently concerning some of the different items that Radio First  Termer has to offer his followers.  And one of the biggest things is the official Dave Rabbit sweatshirt. 
[02:08:30]  For those of you who are unaware of what a Dave Rabbit sweatshirt is, I'll tell you, it's  a white sweatshirt.  On the front of it, it has a large white rabbit.  And the rabbit's dick is completely hard.  The rabbit is carrying a sign.  On the sign, it reads, fuck it, before it fucks you.  If you'd like one of these Dave Rabbit sweatshirts, send a postcard, along with 298, to Dave Rabbit 
[02:09:00]  sweatshirt, Radio Saigon, Underground, APO, in-country, 96969.  Wow.  Cream, white room.  Wow.  That guy is funny.  That's funny.  That guy is funny.  Yeah, his slogan was, the hits keep on coming.  There's a t-shirt behind you there. 
[02:09:30]  Fuck it.  The actual t-shirt.  I want my brother to make a version of this shirt.  Wow.  Yeah.  Fucking look at the big fucking cock on the rabbit.  Oh, Jesus.  How about, can we get, um.  He has more balls than Lance Armstrong.  Oh, stop.  That was Lewis.  I'm sorry.  His friend.  Gee.  Yeah.  Hey, do we have, wait, do we have any, uh, I want that clip with the flies.  Uh, the lifers are like the flies.  Oh, yeah, that's the one I was asking about.  Did he rock?  I think it's the second, um, message from the latrine.  That's, uh, 22 maybe. 
[02:10:00]  All right.  We're going to play new clips because I know people have been with us all morning.  We got new clips just for XM where they're talking about the hand jobs, the blow jobs.  I mean, this is just online.  You can just pick it up.  Um, I, I.  I mean, do you buy it?  I don't know.  Oh, you can download that.  I found the tape, brought it in, and I had no idea how popular the guy actually is, uh,  still, so.  I gotta, that's why.  I just wanted.  Yeah, here we go.  Um, him, uh, he did this bit called, uh, message from the latrine walls.  Just reading what people are writing on walls. 
[02:10:30]  That's great.  In the bathroom.  Let's steal it.  You can't judge a book by looking at his cover.  Here's another quickie from the latrines in the Republic of Vietnam.  This guy writes, fighting for someone else's freedom is like fucking for someone else's virginity.  That's not the one.  No.  What power? 
[02:11:00]  Oh, that's the one we had a bleep earlier, too.  Oh, twat power?  Twat power.  But, um.  Squat power.  I contacted, uh, Dave directly last night, so we're gonna try to get him up for my own.  Does he sound insane?  Um, it took a while before he would confess that it was really him.  Like, he kept fishing for information from me before he would, he would talk to me.  What, is he hiding out?  He's been hiding out.  Yeah, he's got the Vietnam mentality.  Wow.  He's like still living the dream, man.  Yeah, look out.  He's still living the dream.  He's still living the dream. 
[02:11:30]  He's afraid of getting grabbed.  No kidding.  Do you blame him?  Where's the other one, Iraq?  Maybe it's this one?  All right, hold on.  We're gonna, a couple more clips from Dave, uh, Rabbit.  During the night, we're gonna be reading some of the things off of latrine walls around the Republic of Vietnam.  Here's one of them.  While I'm home, my wife is my right hand.  While I'm away, my right hand is my wife.  Cookin' from the Big 69. 
[02:12:00]  The Who.  From the Rock Opera, Tommy.  Pinball Wizard.  Who's cooler than this fucking dude?  No shit.  It's unbelievable.  Playing all new music.  Oh, yeah.  For the time.  Yeah.  Yeah, this was like...  No, it's unbelievable.  Brand new from The Who.  Yeah, he's...  Cream.  Cream.  White Room. 
[02:12:30]  We're gonna let this next one roll on.  Why?  Well, for one reason, I'm gonna go take a big, heavy crap.  In boring, unforeseen incidences that may occur during my trip to the latrine, such as being picked up from marijuana,  are stomping in and getting a quick fuck with one of the boys down the hall. 
[02:13:00]  I'll be back to finish this goddamn program.  Wow.  He would've fit in with us, man.  This goddamn program.  And where is he working now?  We don't know.  We're trying to find out more about it.  Is he just on the web doing it?  He's doing a podcast.  Yeah, it's like a podcast.  Wow.  Where's the one about this shit?  Yeah, who would you fucking want this guy on?  Why doesn't Satellite Radio hire him?  Maybe it's the third one.  Yeah.  Fucking man, for a guy like that, he's just great.  What am I talking about? 
[02:13:30]  I don't know.  Where is it?  I'm boring myself.  I could've just stopped after watching Satellite hire him.  Why don't you...  Where does his manager?  I just spiraled out of control.  Yeah.  I had nothing to say.  He talks about the lifers.  Oh, I think this is it right here.  Okay.  I love this one.  Well, actually, we got...  Let me play this one, too, because these are all unedited.  Way better when you hear the curses.  This motherfucker is so goddamn long.  Oh!  He got annoyed because he played a really long record.  I don't recognize the song. 
[02:14:00]  So in the middle of it, he just pops the mic on.  He's like, this motherfucking song is goddamn too long.  This motherfucker is so goddamn long, I could've gone downstairs and got a shot of back, rambling  on with more music.  By the way, my buddy Stork, who gave me the tape, he said that he said, get a shot of Mac,  not back.  Yeah.  And it is a heroin word.  Wow.  A drug thing.  So...  That I didn't know. 
[02:14:30]  This motherfucker is so goddamn long, I could've gone downstairs and got a shit  shot of back, rambling on with more music, iron butterfly, soul experience, speed kills, slow  down, smoke grass, smoke grass, just underground shit, man, not government. 
[02:15:00]  Radio.  That's extraordinary.  And nobody...  What's amazing is that I am just hearing about it this morning.  Yeah.  I never heard of this guy.  Nope.  I never heard of him.  No.  And I had friends there.  One more clip before we give you a couple new ones.  This is, I think, the one we finally...  I love this.  About the shit.  Iron butterfly, soul experience.  Lifers are like flies.  They both eat shit and bother people. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you, Pete.  He's got his fucking high friend in the background, Lois.  He goes...  You missed it.  He goes, right on!  Listen to the background.  Thank you, Pete.  Iron butterfly, soul experience.  Lifers are like flies.  They both eat shit and bother people.  Right on!  Thank you, Pete.  Thank you, Pete.  What delivery this fucking dude has. 
[02:16:00]  He's great.  Yeah, this guy was having a ball.  And bother people.  And bother people.  Finally...  Bother me.  Finally, new clips, because people have been with us all morning.  These three clips are for XM only, man.  Talking about the hand jobs, the blow jobs.  Here's more of Dave Rabbit from 1970, 1971, when he was in Vietnam doing underground radio for  everybody.  Tonight's news comes from both Saigon and the FanRang areas.  First off from Saigon, we find that a new massage house was recently opened up near the 
[02:16:30]  Korean tailor shop.  The following services are available.  Steam bath, back massage, hand jobs, and blow jobs.  Hours are from 0700 hours for maggots, 7 a.m. for first termers, until 1630 hours for maggots,  and 4.30 p.m. for first termers.  Reservations may be made by calling with extension 2269.  Wow.  And now from FanRang area, here's Nugent. 
[02:17:00]  The Nutang flights have been reopened and have a new champagne flight that leaves FanRang at  8 a.m.  It will operate on a first-come, first-go basis.  The commander also recommends that you take an ample supply of rubbers as they have a shit  pot full of new whores at the bars.  The commander's motto is morale high on the base.  And that's the news for this early edition.  Wow.  Next news will be later on.  Next local news will be later on, too.  Good night, Nugent. 
[02:17:30]  Good night, Dave.  And good night for this early edition of radio first-termer news.  Wow.  Shit pot.  Right at the end there, with the news, he cuts his signal.  So every time he does the news thing, he goes right into static, and then before it  cuts out and goes dead.  Why?  He only broadcasts for a certain amount of hours a day, so I guess when he does the news  it's pretty much towards the end of his broadcast, and then he just flips the switch and his  signal goes dead. 
[02:18:00]  Wow.  Sounds like he did it yesterday.  It sounds more modern than what the shit we have to listen to now.  Well, yeah.  That's great.  Then you got Howard saying he invented this whole thing.  Obviously, this shit was being done a long time ago.  You got to acknowledge the people that came before you, man.  Holy crap.  This guy was an original.  Yeah.  I wonder if he ever had a real radio career after he got back from the war.  Is he ever heard of him?  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe he went by another name and was kind of doing more legit shit.  I don't know.  Know who would know is, get stupid Abrams on the phone. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, my God.  Here's Dave Rabbit's philosophy, and he does theater listings.  I can only imagine what movies he's reviewing here.  Here's Dave Rabbit's philosophy, pussy is the breakfast of champions.  Well, it's time to take a look and see what's happening at the Viking Theater at Van Rang,  the theaters at Saigon, the Trang, and the Cam'ron Bay Area. 
[02:19:00]  Tonight, the movie is Lust, Sex, and Greed, starring Bridget Bardo, Samantha Abbott,  Tim Conway, Jonathan Winters, and Hugo Montenegro.  He's just me.  The following night is Bambi, a Walt Disney production of A Little Deer and How He Got Shafted.  The next one is Fear and Chills as the blood of Dracula rolls down on all the patrons.  Here's a chance to really throw some money away.  Wow, my fucking favorite, this guy. 
[02:19:30]  This guy is great.  Right on.  You want more or what?  Yes, of course.  Here's another quickie from Latrine.  The carnival act of sex is held to be sacred.  Eating pussy is perversion.  Signed, Omar.  Omar, someone wrote under this, Omar died from syphilis of the tongue and throat. 
[02:20:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, say good evening to Buffalo Springfield.  Wow.  Hey, that's a cool way to intro a record right there.  That's pretty fucking cool, man.  This guy's amazing.  Yeah.  Fucking cool.  You know what?  Fuck it.  Let's play the rest of this shit.  It's really good.  It really is.  We got just a few more.  We'll play the one from earlier, the public service announcement. 
[02:20:30]  I'm drawing a little grass now.  I'm going back into music by Steppenwolf called The Pusher.  Speaking of The Pusher, brothers and sisters, if you happen to be down by the Magic Finger Lounge  of Time's Night, keep away from the Korean at the front door.  He's pushing some bad H.  Wow.  I repeat, he's pushing some bad H. 
[02:21:00]  Wow.  It's stunning.  And you figure, and he's the source of information.  Well, they had the real information, and then you had this guy that was like more of a street  guy.  But it's also, it's that whole way, you know, back then of getting information.  Because nobody, the real information, they're not going to tell you that the H is bad.  They don't even acknowledge that their troops are doing H.  Yeah, they're going to tell you, ah, avoid the fish.  You know, we got a bad shipment. 
[02:21:30]  Not avoid the H.  You're right.  And the cream sauce.  Right, and the cream sauce.  You're getting your information from a guy who's in the back of a whorehouse.  That's where you got to get, it's like nothing has changed in this country.  They're getting their information from, you know, us.  And we're like two steps away.  I don't know anything.  Where's Lee?  We have a mic, so they think we know because it comes out of the radio.  I heard it.  No, I heard it on the radio.  Oh, then it must be true.  No, we said it.  Here's another saying from the green walls. 
[02:22:00]  If you're sitting down taking a crap and reading this, you're probably the only motherfucker  in the Republic of Vietnam that knows what he's doing.  Here's one that cuts your stereo full blast and blow that motherfucker out in the next room.  Hendrix.  Fire.  He's talking over the vocals, though.  He doesn't know how to hit the post.  Hendrix.  Fire.  Well, first of all, that song's two minutes long, so maybe you should just shut up on 
[02:22:30]  that one.  Oh, sorry.  He's a legend.  I like him.  Hendrix.  And now for a word from good old Pete.  He's got some information for some of you people out there.  Pete, what do you got for us tonight, buddy?  Thank you, Dave.  As it is our policy to keep our listeners well informed, we have a special news item that  should be a special interest for the patrons of the Castle Club this evening.  We have just learned of an MP raid at 10 p.m., or I should say 10.30 p.m. tonight. 
[02:23:00]  So, if I were you, ditch the grass, age, speed, and make yourself plenty scarce.  Thank you, Dave.  Thank you, Pete, for those wise words.  And I would take heed to what Pete says.  He hangs around at all these joints out there, and he knows.  He's the nose that knows, if you can dig what I'm saying. 
[02:23:30]  I could dig it.  Was anyone fighting over there?  It sounded like they were having a great time.  Just hanging.  Just hanging out in whorehouses, doing H, listening to Hendrix.  That's not a bad life right there.  He had some kind of connection where he would reveal where officers were maybe dining out  for the evening.  Oh, shit.  And any time the MPs were going to set a drug bust or a surprise inspection, they'd get  the information and start broadcasting right away, right as the MPs are heading to wherever 
[02:24:00]  the troops are.  Wow.  All right, we got another clip.  What, warn the troops?  Yeah.  We got, oh, he does a dedication to the U.S. Army.  I can only imagine what this sounds like.  Instant request line.  Spencer Davis Group.  I'm a man.  This is a dedication to the United States Army.  Army sucks.  That was called in by General Creighton W. Avery. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  Called in by General Creighton.  Was he in the service?  This guy?  Yeah.  I mean, was he just, did he just show up?  He was in there for a year and then was discharged or released because they screwed up his paperwork.  So he was labeled as something called a 1H, which he asked what was and they said it's classified.  We can't tell you.  Classified.  So he did a year and then was released but decided to hang around and do this radio station. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Oh, so he was in Army when this was happening?  No, he had already served his time.  Oh, cool.  All right.  I could fuck with him.  I bet you, I wonder if he's afraid of saying who he really is because he's afraid that his Army pension or something will be affected.  His military pension.  Yeah.  Here's another quickie from the latrine walls in the Republic of Vietnam.  This joker writes,  18 days until I can go home to picket and protest this fucking weight of human lives that lifers and the government call a war. 
[02:25:30]  Haas Cartwright is a fairy.  Signed, his mother.  Oh, shit.  Signed, his mother.  Wow.  He like, just, he knows how to twist that shit, right?  It's good.  It's so solid. 
[02:26:00]  That's anti-military commie this guy was.  No kidding, man.  Let's find him.  Can you wait to play a clip?  I got to pee.  Yeah, let's, we'll take a break.  So that's it for today.  I think we did all our clips.  We're going to try to find more, Iraq?  Yeah.  Good quality?  All right.  We'll hopefully have more tomorrow.  We'll continue down this road with Dave Rabbits from the big 69.  I got to track him down today.  That's great.  And the hits just keep on coming.  Coming.  Hendrix, I know he's singing, but I'm high. 
[02:26:30]  Hi, this is Louis Black.  You're listening to, fuck.  This is Louis Black.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Damn.  We're going to make believe that Jimmy doesn't know who the surprise guest is because we got  the lovely Jill Nicolini coming back in from the CW.  CW 11.  Where's Jill?  And here he is. 
[02:27:00]  Oh.  Mr. Checker.  Chubby Checker.  Chubby Checker.  It's Chubby Checker.  Oh, hi.  I'm Jim.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Happy birthday to Jimmy.  Happy birthday to Jimmy.  Chubby Checker.  It's Chubby Checker.  Thank you very much, sir.  Joy, because nothing is you going to get.  Thank you very much.  Why would that mic work?  How does Chubby Checker look so good?  Do the mic not work?  No, it's not working.  The mic doesn't work.  Of course not.  Why would it?  It's been around forever. 
[02:27:30]  Yes.  What's going on?  Yeah, sit down, please.  Do we have an extra?  Hold on.  Do we have to get a mic that works?  There we go.  Thank you so much.  That works.  So it's wonderful being here.  Thank you.  You look really good, sir.  For allowing me to be among the dudes.  Thank you.  Just laugh.  Thank you.  To be among the young lions, you know, it's cool.  Are you on the road or no?  I'm always on the road.  Look on ChubbyChecker.com.  We got gigs all over the place. 
[02:28:00]  In fact, I'm doing the morning show tomorrow on CBS.  And after that, we're going to go to Newark Airport.  I'm going to get on a plane.  I'm going to be in Kansas.  The car's going to pick me up.  I'm going to join the Wildcats.  And we're going to do a gig tomorrow night.  We've got gigs in Virginia on the 26th.  We're all booked up next August.  How many years have you been doing this?  Since I got out of high school.  I graduated high school in 1960 while the twist was being played on the radio, which is kind of cool. 
[02:28:30]  And in my yearbook, I'm already ChubbyChecker in my year class.  And then when I graduated, the twist was being played on the radio.  And I've been doing On the Road ever since I left high school in 1960.  You were a high school kid and you had a hit record while you were in high school?  I had a song called The Class that was number 34 on the charts when I was in 1958.  When I was like 17.  Did you get mad late in school?  Huge amounts of... 
[02:29:00]  It was so cool.  And then in 1959, I thought it was all over.  And then we made this song called Twist.  And we had to campaign this because we had to go around to all these record hops and all these places to get this music played.  And then the kids started seeing the way I did the dance.  And then it kind of caught on.  And then one thing led to another.  And a few radio stations started playing it.  And all the kids started requesting it.  And then Dick Clark brought me on American Bandstand. 
[02:29:30]  And I didn't know at that moment that the life in the music industry and everything that was in music was going to change forever.  It was almost like when Alexander Graham Bell said, Watson, is that you?  Because the very minute that we went on TV and did that song, The Twist, dancing in the world changed forever.  It was never to be the same again.  What came first, a song or the dance?  Actually, Hank Ballard wrote the song and recorded it.  And the radio played the song for a while. 
[02:30:00]  And they stopped playing it.  Radio is still very powerful.  You don't get no play, you get no payday.  Bye-bye.  And The Twist did not get any airplay.  And it was a dead issue.  And the guys at the record company said, Chubby, let's let Chubby do that song of Twists because we really think it's going to be something special.  And they had already did the track and everything.  And Dave Apple says, Chubby, come on in.  We're going to do the Twists.  I said, David, I said, he says, just come in here and do it.  So I walked from my house all about 20 blocks and went upstairs and I already knew the song. 
[02:30:30]  And I sang the song.  And we did, my daddy's sleeping.  And then we finished.  Dave says, Chubby, I want to do it one more time because that daddy's sleeping.  He says, it's a little flat.  I says, David, I'm going to flunk school.  I'm not going to graduate.  My grades are terrible.  I'm going home and do my homework.  And they are never going to know. 
[02:31:00]  And I left the studio.  Little did I know.  But when I went outside the studio, I had a strange kind of feeling, you know.  And I said, ah.  But we didn't know that it was going to be the only song that became number one twice since God put man on the planet.  We didn't know that in the 60s there was the Beatles and Elvis and the British Invasion and Woodstock.  And Jimi Hendrix and all the rest of the stuff that happened. 
[02:31:30]  Motown, The Twist is the number one song of the entire 60s.  So you're in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, right?  So happy birthday, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  Do you get sick of hearing it?  Like, everybody requests the song from 1960.  Are you ever like, because I'm 40 today.  Do you ever, like, get sick of, like, people say, all right, that song?  The song changed the world.  And you know something?  Anyone that goes on the floor and does the boogie to anybody's music.  Wait, what song changed the world?  The Twist. 
[02:32:00]  All The Twist, right.  I'm not a very good dancer.  Do people ever say that you're in better shape than Jacqueline?  I'm looking at you and you're just so tight.  Oh.  That's Voss.  All the people at XM, God is with me.  He's looking after the chub, taking care of me.  Did you ever go on those tours, too, with Alan Freed, the doo-wop tours and all that stuff?  You ought to know you were in high school when they happened.  It was a little before me.  It was right before you, isn't it?  It was a little before me.  Jesus, Rich.  What do you think?  He's as old as you?  You know, Alan Freed, you know, he was a pretty great guy, Alan Freed. 
[02:32:30]  That's why the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is in Cleveland, because of Alan Freed.  They've got his ashes there.  He's great.  He's another Jew.  Good people.  Well, hey.  Moshpukha.  Me too.  Moshpukha.  Hey, what does that mean?  Moshp-family.  Oh, yeah.  I thought it meant the twer.  You can't be a heathen, not know that.  Moshpukha.  I'm not Jewish.  You're not Jewish.  I am.  Well, we all can't be Jewish.  I am, and I didn't know what it meant.  He's an Irishman, one of our own birthday.  One of our own.  It's one of our own, lads.  Wow. 
[02:33:00]  Happy birthday, Billy.  One of our own, lads.  That's pretty good.  You ought to hear Bob do his English accent.  Good grief.  So the new song is debuting when?  On the 22nd.  The official release is on the 22nd.  We're going to debut at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 630, that's a Wednesday.  It's a free concert.  It's in the FYE record store.  We want everybody to come there because we're going to kick some butt there.  We always kick butt. 
[02:33:30]  We do that.  Chubby, we've had a very odd selection of guests today.  Yeah, we sure have.  We have had Sabra Kadabra, who's a Black Sabbath cover band.  I'm sure you're a Sabbath fan.  Yeah.  And yourself, of course, and Michael K. Williams from The Wire, and of course, Louis C.K.  Yes.  It's been a very weird day.  Yeah.  It's been just an assortment.  The smorgasbord of guests.  A lot of different genres.  Yes.  Jim Norton theme.  I think right now, for what's happening with what we're doing with that song, it's like  nothing else that's going on like that.  We're in the music industry right now. 
[02:34:00]  What song?  At all.  Knock Down the Walls.  In the whole music industry, there's nothing going on like that.  Mr. Chubby, how many times have you performed The Twist?  It's all my life.  But how many times do you think you've performed The Twist?  As many times as Walt Disney does Mickey Mouse.  That's as many times.  Let's be honest.  You're sick of The Twist at this point.  You've got to be sick of The Twist.  Do you have any idea what it means?  How could you ever get sick of having sex?  How do you put it in?  Oh, hey. 
[02:34:30]  No, come, come, come, come.  I'm going to.  How many times will you be ever sick of having sex?  Now, let me tell you what The Twist is.  It's just another word for, come on, baby.  Let's do The Twist.  Oh, let's fuck.  Oh, let's fuck.  Hey.  No, take me by my little hand.  Hey, take me by my little hand and go like this.  Go like this.  Oh.  My mom is sleeping and daddy's sleeping and mom ain't around. 
[02:35:00]  We're going to twist and twist and twist until we tear the house down.  You get tired of that?  I don't think so.  So you got away with one.  I never knew that was about.  That's exactly what it's about.  Why do you think it's the only song to be number one twice?  It's all.  You know something?  That is the nastiest, most suggestive, sexy song that was ever recorded.  You got to twist it, because if you can't get hard, if you twist it up, you can still shove 
[02:35:30]  it in there.  At the end of the song, it says, yeah, that's all right.  Yeah.  Twist so nice.  Twist.  Boop, boop.  Why don't you do an X-rated version, man?  You'll pay a lot of money.  Ask Rudy Reymour.  He does.  Yeah, really?  Rudy Reymour does all the nasty twist things.  Dolemy, yes.  I've met Dolemy.  He does some nasty.  Do the gist.  How about this, guys?  Disc jockeys.  Have you ever heard of an artist having five albums on the top 12 all at the same time on 
[02:36:00]  the charts?  Oh, my God.  Well, Foundry did it back in the day.  Foundry certainly did it before.  No, sorry.  Never had four, not five.  Never happened before.  All right.  You have five albums in the top 12.  Five albums in the top 12, all on the charts at the same time.  Are you doing the Ali story, too?  Wrong about that.  What's up next, by the way?  How about the first platinum?  How's that?  How's that?  It looks like Ali's old trainer.  First platinum.  I love shoving that.  Let me tell you about Ali.  Want to hear about Ali?  Yeah.  Tell us about some celebrity dirt.  I taught Ali how to run his big, fat mouth. 
[02:36:30]  Whoa.  Did you really?  Listen.  When he was Cassius?  No, true story.  Yeah, when he was Cassius.  I was in Louisville doing a concert, and there he was.  He and his brother, Rudy, came in to see me, and I just, I love, I love Ali.  We're good friends.  Ali has a brother named Rudy?  Named Rudy, yes.  Who the fuck knew that?  And they came into, so Ali, you know, Cassius says, you know, I says, he said, you know,  I like you.  You know, your music's real nice, man, everything.  He says, you know, I want to be champ.  I said, what are you doing here?  I said, you should be a movie star, not a fighter.  You look too pretty to be getting your face banged up. 
[02:37:00]  He said, no, but I want Rudy to be champ.  I said, so what do you want me to do for you?  He said, maybe give me some pointers.  Can you may help me, because I'm young, and, you know, and I said to him, I says,  Cassius, how good are you?  He says, this is what he says, I'm the best that ever lived.  And I says, really?  He says, I said, I know you're good.  He's on the best that ever lived.  I said, I'll tell you what you do.  I said, if you're the best, I says, when you go out in the ring, and you look at it,  and you say, he's going to go down in that round. 
[02:37:30]  Can you do that?  He said, he thought about that for a while.  He said, you know, I said, can you do that?  He said, I can do that.  Well, then you'll be the best.  I said, but it's not good enough.  You're good looking.  No one's going to pay any attention to you, because you're pretty.  You've got to run your mouth.  You've got to do things to make something happen.  You've got to make a big deal out of it.  So you made him into who he became.  Look, he already had what he had.  I just showed him how to move it.  And you know something?  When he became a big star, he wouldn't tell nobody about it.  And you know what, he was so happy. 
[02:38:00]  If you hadn't met Chubby Checkers.  Hold on, he was so happy by what you taught him that he gave you his old hair.  You look like him, Cassius Clay.  You've got the Cassius Clay hair.  You are better.  You taught Cassius how to talk.  Voss taught Sonny Liston how to be stupid.  I really felt sorry for Sonny, because Cassius came out, and he picked up the chub, because  in the fifth round, he's coming out in the sixth, and he says, this is it.  And that invisible punch came, and the rest of the story. 
[02:38:30]  So I wrote him a letter about five years ago on his birthday.  I says, why didn't you ever tell anybody about that story, about what I said?  You don't want to share your fame with me.  Huh.  But we're very good friends, and we're very good friends with his family, and we're very  good friends.  We always have been.  He shows up on a lot of my shows.  Did anybody open for you that became a real, real big star?  Is it hard for you to talk to a man?  BG's.  Is it hard for you to talk to a man whose headset is on like that?  It hurts my other ear.  It hurts his ear.  Give him the right hand.  An NFL coach.  Did BG's open for you? 
[02:39:00]  Did you ever work with, like, The Temptations or anybody like that, or Diana Ross or any Motown  people?  You know, I never worked with Diana, and only with the four tops.  You worked with the four, yeah?  Yeah.  I just did a show with Sticks, and a show with, uh, oh, I just did a concert with Sticks  and, uh, and, uh, Grassroots.  Boston.  Humble pie.  Journey.  I just did a show with them up in Northern Michigan.  Big concert. 
[02:39:30]  It was really cool.  Sticks and who else?  Journey.  And, uh, Grassroots.  Grassroots.  Yeah.  I don't know them.  I know, I know Sticks.  You know Sticks, yeah.  I like them.  They kind of jumped the shark after they did, uh, the Mr. Roboto stage show.  Let's be honest, Chubby.  Nobody liked it.  Nobody liked them acting it out.  It was a little weird.  Well, you know, people make mistakes.  You could, you could do, you know?  I know, but I'm just saying.  Oh, by the way, I want everyone out there to pray for my wife because she's not doing well.  She was in the hospital.  She just got out, so I'll pray for Rina.  Pray for my girl, Rina, because she's not doing too well. 
[02:40:00]  Is she going to be all right?  What happened?  I think she'll be okay.  She's, you know, she's got a little something in her neck and had to go to the doctor.  So, you know, pray for my girl.  I've been hanging out since 1964.  Wow.  Are you worried?  It's a long time.  Of course I'm worried.  You know, if you live with somebody a long time like that, you know, it kind of, you know.  So, anyway, I just wanted to bring it up.  So, when you think of the chub, think of my girl and say a little prayer for her, okay?  You ever get sick of the recognition or people, I mean, obviously people flock you because you're a chubby checker. 
[02:40:30]  Does it ever get to be irritating where you just want to be kind of left alone?  Well, you know, it doesn't really bother me because, you know, without, I hate it when they do it.  I hate it when they don't.  That's the best way to do that because, you know, without the people, I'm nothing.  And, you know, if they're not listening to your show, you're nothing.  Even with them, we're nothing.  No, they're very valid.  No, they're very valuable.  People are very valuable.  And I take great pride in having â€“ I came out of the studio this morning, and there were 20 people with my abs and everything. 
[02:41:00]  And I said, I'm signing some of them, and let's sign some, and then the next time we'll see each other again.  Sign the other ones.  Yes, but I can tell you something.  It's wonderful to have fans.  And believe me, I embrace, you know, them admiring me, and I can't get tired of that.  I can't get tired of that.  You're a very interesting guy.  I've got to say that.  You're certainly not like anybody we've had in before.  I would love to get a picture with Chubby.  I'm 40 years young.  Of course.  40 years old.  Shut up.  I want to hear about 40 years old. 
[02:41:30]  What?  You're just a baby.  Mr. Checker.  You haven't even started nothing yet.  I'm becoming an older gentleman.  No, you're not.  Not yet.  It hasn't happened yet.  When it happens, you know, it's in your head.  Don't let it get you.  I'm a bit nervous.  Don't be nervous.  As long as everything's working, you're in service.  Jimmy, Jimmy, I've got to ask Mr. Checker something.  Hurricane Katrina, you lost a lot.  Now, see, you think I'm Fats Domino.  Everybody, you think all the...  Hey, hey, hey.  Jesus, Opie.  Hey, hey, hey.  Think all the black guys look the same?  That's right.  Unbelievable. 
[02:42:00]  Chubby's grabbing my arm.  Chubby's a strong kid.  Hey, hey, hey.  That's Fats Domino.  That's not Chubby, Checker.  Of course it is.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And his lady says, oh, he says, I know you had trouble with Katrina.  I says, that's Fats Domino.  I go in the airport.  Guess what they say?  What do they say?  Hey, Mr. Barry.  Freeze.  I says, I'm not a Chuck Barry.  Mr. Barry.  Lady says, lady says to me, she says, she says, oh, there's Charlie.  He says, you're proud.  I says, thank you, ma'am.  You know his cousin, Marvin Barry?  I get all that. 
[02:42:30]  It's so annoying.  I get that all the time, too.  It's like, hey, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Cruz.  Come on, Jimmy.  Jimmy, you have the Chubby.  Hey, Chubby.  They only call me Mr. Cruz in the rest area.  Is there any way we could get you to do a little twist with Sabra Cadabra?  I don't know.  I don't want to put you on the spot.  I understand.  Let's just tell you what.  It's got, of course, $10,000.  Why don't you?  $10,000 to play the.  That mic doesn't work. 
[02:43:00]  Is that all, Gary?  Is that it?  Well, that's without me.  He's got to be the Jewish guy.  I mean, that's it.  Hey, I'm a Jew.  Hey, wait, wait.  I'm a Jew.  I'm a Jew.  I can see.  I can see.  Hey, I'm a Heap.  What does this guy do?  Let me have to Bob Dylan.  Hold on.  Let's see.  $10,000 will do the twist.  Yeah, well, y'all.  And that's a discount.  This was $20,000 to come to the studio, so you owe us $10,000.  All right.  All right.  So play the new record.  We're the good old boys.  $10,000 we get the twist?  You got my new jam? 
[02:43:30]  What do you got on you?  First for about $5,000, sure.  What do you got on you?  You got any money?  What do you got?  You didn't charge us on the CW11 this morning.  That mic doesn't work, Jill.  Oh.  I know you're still trying, but.  That's what I'm talking to you.  And I only told the guys 20 minutes ago.  We had Chubby, obviously, on the CW11 morning news here in New York, and we didn't charge  you.  You didn't charge us.  No.  That's his girlfriend.  Yeah, I know.  That's his girlfriend.  And I was saying, I says, are you in good shape for that?  I says, are you doing lip sit-ups?  Are you doing lip sit-ups?  She's a lovely girl. 
[02:44:00]  I mean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, you got to stay in good shape.  I'm worried about you.  I'm worried.  You might overdose and die?  No, you got to stay in good shape.  He has some advice for us.  Hey, guys, you got the key of E going on?  The key of E?  Key of E.  Oh, you got it?  And I want the bass to give me some eighth notes, some punk stuff.  Oh, damn.  We might get something going on here.  No, it's got to sound more like, listen, listen, listen.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  I want to punk it out a little bit.  And I want to hear a little Chuck Berry on the guitar. 
[02:44:30]  He loves it.  No, no, no, no.  No, just the chords.  Just the chords.  A little.  Watch for the changes and try to keep up.  Hold up.  Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.  I don't want to hear a dude.  I don't want to hear that.  This is what it's going to be like if Barack was president.  I want straight on Rolling Stones.  I want straight on Mellencamp.  I want to.  But now, but now you got to pick it up.  You got to pick it up fast.  Let me hear it.  Okay, let's see. 
[02:45:00]  Let's see.  Here we go.  All right.  Let's see.  Chubby's getting up.  Let me hear you.  Let me hear you.  Let me hear you.  Let me hear you.  Let me hear you.  Let me hear you.  Once again, when I cut down, I want to cut.  One, two, three.  Ha!  Come on baby

[02:48:00]  That is a legendary performance  Wow  Chubby checker  With sabra-cadabra  When are you going to see anything like that?  Chubby, chubby, chubby  This is amazing 
[02:48:30]  Chubby checker backed up by sabra-cadabra  So perfect  You'd think he'd sang this song 5,000 times  What I want them to hear  What the hell did sabra-cadabra do wrong?  I want them to hear the contrast between that  And their lives  That was amazing  The contrast between that  And knocked on the walls  That's what you need to hear  That's right  Did you used to, like, drive a tour bus naked?  I always  What, what?  Is that a bad one?  Well, almost 
[02:49:00]  That's the stuff people want to hear about  Well, the thing is, you know, sometimes we do a show  And we have to make it  And the drivers, you know, have to have sleep  And I've got half of my clothes on  Because, you know, I've left the fans  And I just get behind the wheel  And do about three or four hours  So the driver can get some sleep  Because it's not odd to see me behind the tour bus driving it  Because I'll do it  Why should they have all the fun?  But you have to do it naked for everybody?  Well, sometimes a little air comes in  Sometimes it makes you feel good 
[02:49:30]  Sometimes it takes some clothes off  Now I know why they call you Chubby  You got a nice piece, right?  Chubby's got a piece  That's right  Are they the first garage band you ever played with?  Ashley, was it  The guy's from Wishbone Ash?  Really?  Yeah  Thank you for coming in  It was, uh  It's great to have you  A lot of fun  Happy birthday, Bubba  Thank you  I wouldn't have known it was you  But our crack staff  Because of the surprise  Played the twist  20 minutes before you walked in  I see  Because that's always a way to keep the surprise going 
[02:50:00]  Well, that's okay  I think that was quite, uh, cool  The twist is a wonderful song  Sing a legendary song  Like the twist  Performed by  Of course  The legendary Chubby Checker  But Chubby playing it with Sabra Cadabra  With Sabra Cadabra  Isn't that great?  You'll never see that again  Everywhere  No, they were good  Some kind of  Acid hallucination  Is what that was like  Yeah  Let me tell you  In two weeks  You're going to be a Chubby Checker cover band  Musician talk  Musician talk  Yeah, absolutely  Can I tell you  Can I tell you  Chubby didn't play fucking games either  Take it down  You  Do this 
[02:50:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah  Just the court, stupid  Yeah  You see how he's out the order  You see how he bossed them around  That's why we don't want Barack  But what was great about them  Is that  The great thing about them  Is that  They follow instructions  And that's the most important thing  That's it  Now we should flip it  And make Chubby sing  A Black Sabbath song  The band gets shirts  Is he your tour manager  Is he your tour manager  He produces all those records  Gary's a record producer  And he's very good at what he does  And if it wasn't for Gary  I really wouldn't be

Louis CK had me cry  What did he do?  Chubby was talking about his history  So Louis goes  Alright, and  Happy Birthday Jim, right?  Oh, yeah  Chubby's an interesting guy  He certainly is

I'm just wondering  I don't really know  I don't know  I'm a little confused  By this one  I think  I think Chubby  He loves it!  His hair is like  The sponge inside  Of a stamp thing 
[02:54:30]  Where you make  You know  The stamp  When you make  Oh, my God  He's not still here, is he?  Oh, God  I wanted to twist his head  I wanted to practice my putting on his hair  It's like  It's like a  Chia Chubby  Exactly  I wanted to  I said I'm in the head  With a Nerf bat  Is he still  Fucking doing it  Oh, God  It just was so funny  How he just took over  Like where there's  Jimmy's birthday  And now we're all listening 
[02:55:00]  To his slow story  About one song  In a trillion  That came out in 59  Like Jimmy gives a fuck  On his 40th birthday  About the genesis  Of the fucking twist  By the end of the story  The Chia Afro  Grew another  Me, Chia  Fucking Afro helmet  You needed a chin strap  With that  Fucking Chia checkers 
[02:55:30]  He was like  You know what?  I got hostile with him  Because he's like  My dad  My dad does that  Oh, really?  Everybody's having a good time  And instead of saying  On everybody else's frequency  And talking  He'll just go  You know  And we all go  Oh, fuck  You fucking microphone  Protector head  Or windscreen  It is  Microphone  That's where he got it  He was doing a gig  And they had one of those  Well, let's bring Chubby in  Let's bring Chubby in 
[02:56:00]  And see how brave  We really are  No, let's not  I think Chubby likes Chubby  He's 64 years old  By the way  Doing that shit  He's gone?  He's gone  Alright, now let's really  Get the jokes going  Alright, here's the thing  Chubby was  No, the way he was talking  About the gigs  He was going to play  He was like  We're playing here  And doing the morning show  And then I'm going  To Newark Airport  And I'm like  Oh, you're playing  In the airport  Gate C4 
[02:56:30]  To get a flight  To Kansas City  Where I'm going to do a gig  Can I ask you a question?  Like, you go and  See Chubby Checker  Yeah  How many songs  No, I don't  How many songs  Do you sit through  Where you start getting frustrated  That he's not playing  The twist  You'll give him the first  You'll give him one  Maybe two songs  And you're like  Will you get to the fucking twist?  No, definitely  He probably  The twist probably goes on  For like 12 minutes  When he does this  Everybody does a solo  I like to see him  Doing the twist  And his body's moving  But his hair is staying 
[02:57:00]  In one spot  Underneath him  But he didn't even  Write the twist  I thought he wrote it  No, that's his thing  It was Ray Ballard  That's from James Brown  Well, fucking Voss  You really got to the meat  Of the issue  Did you ever meet  The Temptations?  Shut up  Well, because I want to  You just like him  Because he held your arm  The whole time  I like what Chubby said  A fucking legend  In the studio  And we beat the shit out of him  And what did we  Why did we do this  To Sabra Kedavra?

Yeah, you know  Chubby, do you like  When people clap  To you?  No  To you  Shit questions  You fucking asshole  Did you ever perform  With Benny Goodman? 
[03:03:00]  Yes  It's going back  If you were at Marvin Gaye's house  But you jumped in front of the bullet  Chubby, to you  You're a fucking cunt  And your questions are terrible  Did you ever go to Motown?  Shut up  How do they receive you in Israel?  Fucking zilch  Oh my god  The fucking worst questions  Would you be starstruck  If you met Ali now  And him taking credit for Ali 
[03:03:30]  I bet you Ali learned to fight  Because he was like  Get away from me, faggot  Holy shit  Holy shit  Oh my god  Vince Vaughn said  He looked like Ali  From the side  Oh my god  Obi goes  Is that Ali's hair?

That's a girl  That's Brett Michaels  No  Oh, no  Let's take a break  Do the rest of the show  Come back and leave  Yes  Sabra Kadabra's going to play  Let's go to commercial  So nobody can hear them  I arranged for Chubby Checker  Let's get Sabra  And I wrote out  Rich's questions  Hi, this is Chubby Checker  You're listening to my pal  Little Jimmy  Little Jimmy  Little Jimmy Norton  One of our own lads  Obi and Anthony 
[03:06:00]  The worst of the Obi and Anthony show  Let's say hi to Chris in Philly  Chris  What's going on, fellas?  What's up, Chris?  I'm the guy that usually calls about Ron Paul here and there  But since you have Mr. Stanhope in the studio  I figured I'd let him do the talking  Oh, I'm a big Ron Paul guy  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, did you even try to have him on? 
[03:06:30]  Well, we kind of beat him up and sent him on his way  Did you?  You had him on?  No, we didn't  Oh, you just beat him up?  Yeah  Oh, why?  I see a bunch of  Because they're zealots?  Because it was fun  We see a bunch of signs and stuff for him  Who's the only guy that was worth it?  At this point, I hope Obama wins  Because in a movie  If there's going to be a president  Portrayed in a movie  Where the fucking asteroid is coming to blow up the earth  And I have those three to choose from  As the actor to play president  Okay 
[03:07:00]  I'll pick Barack  But the only guy that would have made any difference  Is Ron Paul  And it's sad  But people don't give a fuck  We didn't take it seriously  Because we just knew  There just wasn't even a shot  Not going to happen  We had a Baywatch babe  Stumping for him  And we just kind of made fun of her  I'm being honest with you  No one  No one was voting for him  I'm not going to sugarcoat this  It wasn't  He wasn't going to  Why was Ron Paul the only choice there?  I mean, he's the only one that really had any chance of getting less government in our lives  Yeah, but any chance? 
[03:07:30]  Or like, he just wanted that?  And it would have been business as usual?  Again, he's the only one I would trust to do it  Like John McCain  I believe Ron Paul meant what he said  As opposed to anyone else  I think it's  Even Huckabee I like better than these fucking clowns  Huckabee  Because of the fair tax  Yeah, yeah, I know  That's what a lot of people  And that's really my big concern is taxes at this point  I don't give a fuck about the war  I'm not going  It's like, why is it selfish to just think of yourself 
[03:08:00]  Everybody votes selfishly  Yeah  Of course  Like taxes are a big thing  Fucking healthcare  Because they tax the shit out of you  Yeah  But  So that's what I would like to vote for somebody that wants like a flat tax or something like that  Well, yeah  Taxing the shit out of people  Ron Paul and Huckabee were the only ones talking about major tax  Nothing's going to happen with an elected official in this country anymore  It's going to take some kind of ridiculous revolution 
[03:08:30]  A draft  Some kind of uprising  Some kind of invasion from a foreign country  It's going to take some huge thing that really fucks up this country  It was the draft that made Vietnam  That's what turned  Yeah, yeah  We were in Vietnam for a long time before people started getting pissed  That's when kids started dying against their will  Yeah  And not the meatheads who believed the ads  And saw the guy slaying a dragon and signed up  But it's changing his tune  When they're snatching him out of your house  And throwing him in front of shrapnel 
[03:09:00]  Yeah  But Anthony, you said if Obama gets in that a lot would change  Uh, yeah  I'm thinking as  I said a lot  Meaning as much as could possibly change  With what's going on  If Obama gets in  Then everyone can say nigger and it's funny again  Is that it?  Yeah  And if Hillary gets in  Women will bleed a little bit less  Like, that's why I hate people who jump on the bandwagon  Just because they have matching skin tone or genitalia  Well, it's about time one of us was in office  Like, that's not your fucking friend 
[03:09:30]  Yeah  Barack is president  What, mall security is going to stop following you around?  No, you're fucking buddies  We're white males with nothing but white male presidents for our whole lives  We have not flourished under their leadership  Well  Yeah, we did pretty  It did kind of work out  Well, not because of it  Of course not  I liked Taft myself  Taft  Taft  A lot of change under Taft  Uh, let's say hi to Craig in Jersey  Craig  Hey, what's up guys? 
[03:10:00]  Hey  Hey there Craig  Hey  Another big supporter of Ron Paul  Was Donna De'Erico  I remember she called in a couple of weeks ago  Yeah, we gave her some shit  Steve from Yellowstone talked to her  So I was wondering if you guys could maybe replay that  At the end of the show today  Well, Debbie, I don't remember  How long is that called?  Because it might be uncomfortable for  It's a four minute phone call  Doug, we kind of beat up your guy  Oh, that's right  I don't care  I just  You're talking about him at least 
[03:10:30]  More than the regular media does  I guess we just didn't want to hear it from abroad  I used to run around on a beach  Do you guys support anyone or is it all sports to you too?  Now it's beyond anything that I even give a shit about  Did you ever like anyone?  Yeah, I liked that one guy  What was his name?  Larry Craig  No, he's a go-getter  I want a president that has a wide stance when he shits, please  Tap me up a river dance trying to get that guy to my stall 
[03:11:00]  Creep  Duncan Hunter  I liked Duncan Hunter  No, he was an ultra-conservative douchebag  The Gravel guy, he was an insane person  I would have liked to see him go  I like the whole libertarian idea  I like that whole thing  But it just would never work in this country  At this point in the country's history  Again, you're talking absolute libertarian  But if you're pragmatic about it 
[03:11:30]  There's parts of it that can work  There's too many people that can't fucking take care of themselves  Under this government  That just takes you and poutes your ass  That's how we breed them  We breed people  I know, weaklings  You try to legislate against Darwinism and natural selection  And that's what you get  It's a fucking country full of retards  And more of them  Let them fucking fend for themselves  And let them learn on their own  And Jesus  Let them fly through the fucking windshield  Because they're not buckling up  But then don't sue the fucking piss out of me 
[03:12:00]  When you fly through the windshield  That is the problem  Too many goddamn lawyers  Lawyers  Fuck up  More stuff  And if you were to separate government from corporations  Everyone thinks the libertarian ideal won't work  Because, well, now corporations will become government  But that's only if they're in bed together  Yeah  If government has the power to give corporations all these breaks  Then, yeah, you're going to have problems  But if you separate them completely 
[03:12:30]  Or put government in a position where they can't do shit for a corporation  Then it's a different story  Don't you think there'd be just massive poverty  And death on the streets  From people that can't take care of themselves  Without the government being there to fucking coddle them  No, I think easy money spends easily  And I think people are naturally charitable  And they get pissy when you're fucking taking  You're taking 40% of my fucking paycheck  No shit  All of a sudden, the fucking bum on the street  I'm going, fuck you, get a job 
[03:13:00]  Where if I had that money in my pocket  That's why you fucking titty dancers  Titty dancers have easy money  And they spend it easily  You go out with a fucking guy  Who had to work 50 hours at fucking Staples  As an assistant manager  And a titty dancer  More than likely, the titty dancer's going to pick up a tab  Before the other guy does  He has to work way too hard  I think people are naturally charitable  It's like the tsunami  However, it worked out to like $50 per household 
[03:13:30]  Was the average donation to tsunami victims  That was private households  If you had someone go door to door  Knocking on doors  Going, this is the government  You owe us $50 for the tsunami victims  They'd be going, fuck those goos  Let them drown  Because it's the force that's involved  You're so right  When you make money easy  You definitely spend a lot  Yeah, there's easy money to be made  40% of people 
[03:14:00]  It is sickening  The amount of money they want to take  They're fucking repulsive  Right  And they still can't get stuff done  They can't get enough  Where is  I mean  There's already  There's so many charitable organizations out there  That you can go to  The fucking churches  If you  Yeah  But the age old question  Like where the fuck does all this money go  What the hell is wrong  Well, a billion dollars on a war  Yeah, no  I understand that  But  But when you start breaking down  What that money is being used for 
[03:14:30]  In the war  It gets insane  Like, you know  We've all heard the rivets costing $10,000  And all that stuff  Right, yeah  It's ridiculous  Sweet government contracts  How are people who build a government like that  How are they not just executed  For treason  For treason  Yeah  I mean, really  There's a lot of people that should be dispatched  They're in bed together  They got a company that fucking paid to have some guy put in office  They made all kinds of contributions  So that when the guy gets in office  He gives them the sweet contracts and favors 
[03:15:00]  Eh, it's a sweet deal, Wade  I like those numbers  All I wanted to do as you were talking  And I know you're right  Is when you were done  All I wanted to do is go  Says you  That's all I think  Says you  That's all I think  Oh, I wish I could have gone out  I'd have laughed my ass off  Ah, shit  Yeah, well, nothing's gonna get done  Until there's some kind of big fucking revolution  Or an invasion  Yeah, again  People have to really have their 
[03:15:30]  Civil war  Their face put into a fire  Before they fight back  We need, like, American refugees  We need, like, fucking people  Fleeing to Canada  In those huge lines of dying people  In this country  To get it back to a position  Where maybe we can rebuild something cool  I really think if Ron Paul  Had gone after the families of people  Who have someone in prison  It's like 60% of the prison population  Are there for non-violent drug offenses 
[03:16:00]  Absolutely no  Everyone involved in that  Should be fucking hung  You always hear about people  That are doing more time for drugs  Than manslaughter  Do you own your own body?  It's a question of that  Do you believe you own your own body?  Then you should be able to do  Whatever the fuck you want with it  That's basic property ownership  Property rights  So you're talking about  You can't put a fucking pool in  Earlier, yeah  I'm trying to get, like, some work done  At the house  And you go to get permits for things  And they tell you 
[03:16:30]  How many feet something has to be  Off your property line  And you're like, wait  This is my property  I bought this shit  You know, I should be able to  Fucking set up a missile silo  If I want  It's coming in next week  Take that one step further  To your own body  And they're telling you  What you can do with your own body  You can't  I can't put drugs inside of it  Yeah  60%  The highest prison population  Of any country in the world  Right  We excel at something  60% of that  You go after  You use that as a main platform  You have  The families  They can't vote in prison 
[03:17:00]  But their families can  And that's one hell of a  Fucking base of support  That you should have gone after  Hell of an idea  You guys  He smokes a lot of dope, man  The prisoners' families  You got some good ideas  Those votes  You don't own your own body  You don't own your own home  You don't own shit  We talked about that in the past  With America  You know, we're free here  You're free  You're not free to do shit  You really aren't  Yeah, we joke about it  Let's see how free you are  Why don't you take a gun  Go out on the streets of New York  And try to hunt  Hunt for your own dinner 
[03:17:30]  Just go hunt for your own dinner  Start taking pot shots at something  And see how fast you're free  You're free to follow the fucking rules  That's what you're free to do  Man  What a tool I am  This was my closer on  Deadbeat Hero 2004  Imagine if you just like  Saw some nice sweet property  And decided  You're just gonna build  You're just gonna fucking build  I'm just gonna get some wood  And just start building  There's nothing there  I'm gonna build a Saudi  Like fucking Paw Ingles  That's how it used to be 
[03:18:00]  God, can you imagine  Living during those times?  You can come home from Iraq  Without legs  And they say  Well, two more years  You can have a beer  Mm-hmm  Yeah  Yeah, you can't even drink  Like you're 19 years old  He's fucking  Yeah  King Tut ruled the world at 11  And now  We saw how that worked out there  Fucking  They changed his race  And bashed his brains in  And fucking  Wrapped him up in a  Giant tampon  And shipped him around  Like a spectacle  Yeah  And  And he still does better  Than either of us  Oh, you're right 
[03:18:30]  Oh, shit  God damn  King Tut was a  You-know-what lover  Excuse me  But we do have  Regular Joe checking in today  Regular Joe, yes  Yeah, you just can't  Buck the system  Ah  Well, yeah  You can't buck the system  It's like I always say  You can't fight Town Hall  That's just me  Regular  It's a regular Joe guy  Yeah, you know  I like to just say

[03:19:30]  They charge you  $25 per $1,000  Your car is worth  So they take the blue book  Value of your vehicle  They charge you $25  And each year  My value of my vehicle  Is $5,000 this year  And I have to pay  You know, my $2,500  Every year  How is that fucking legal?

[03:23:00]  Never met a cock  That he didn't want  To pop in his mouth  If only for a second  Kevin  Kevin  Hey  Hey, we got a law  That passed  At the first of the year  Called a stripper poll tax  Where any person  That goes into a strip club  Has to pay $5 tax  That has been turned over  To the state  And given to  Victims' rights  Advocate groups  Such as  Battered women  Shelters  And that kind of crap  You better be kidding  They should do that  From boxing proceeds  It's a stripper poll tax 
[03:23:30]  In Texas  Stripper poll tax  Five bucks  Is that a state  A county thing  Or a city  No, this is a state  State tax  It was passed  By the state legislation  That doesn't  I don't believe that  Yeah  Check it out, man  Good old Governor Perry  Punch it out, guys  Alright, let's go to James  In Wisconsin  James  Yeah  I used to do taxes  Back in the day  Man, now I'm a truck driver  Because I've got the money  So, man  Taxes were actually 
[03:24:00]  Volunteer from World War II  Okay  They were volunteering  At that time  To help support the war effort  They were supposed to be  Dropped after that  And they weren't  They're still volunteering  They're not mandatory  Actually, it was  Lincoln  Lincoln instituted  The first income tax  On some level  Which he gets  His second biggest mistake  Well, no  All he did was  Spread slavery  Across color lines  So now we're all  Slaves  But the bottom line  Is if you're going to  Play the game  You've got to play  By their rules 
[03:24:30]  If you don't play  By their rules  They're going to  Throw you out the game  Use the game analogy  I didn't quite get it  You look at the federal government  Hold on, sir  I'm on the sidelines  Get up to the plate  If you don't play  By my game  You're going to  Go to jail  That's right  Because the ball's  In your court  That's right, sir  You're hitting home run  With this one  Go ahead, go  That's right  Have a good day, guys  No lying team  2-8 on the punch out thing  What's up with Abraham Lincoln?  AIDS, and I hope you get it  He instituted the first income tax 
[03:25:00]  Did he?  Yeah  For what reason?  For the war effort  Just for the war  The civil one  Yeah, the civil one  That civil one  I heard, though  It wasn't back then  You just got taxed  On what you owned  Like, they taxed you  The assessor came around  Assessed what you owned  For who?  And then  God damn  And then you'd have to  Pay a tax on it  But then it turned out  Somebody's bright idea 
[03:25:30]  To tax what you made  Like, your earnings  Yeah  What is it?  The 20-something amendment  17th  17th?  No, he doesn't know  Yeah, you wait  Let's go to Sean  In North Carolina  Sean, what's up?  Oh, you know  You got a handful  Of these nuts  That say  Well, you know  You don't have to pay taxes  Who's going to be  The first dumb motherfucker  To jump off that cliff?  It's illegal  And I'm not paying it anymore  Well, Doug  Kind of went down that road 
[03:26:00]  Here's what you do  Is you buddy up  And you get  Opie and Anthony  And Howard Stern  And Bob and Tom  And every fucking morning  Fucking show  Around the country  And you all get together  And go  Hey, let's put our  Bullshit differences aside  And let's get everyone  To go  Hey, fuck you  On April 15th  And start a big  Fucking trend like that  That's how you do it  Did you put us  In the same category  As Bob and Tom?  And now  Dane Cook  I'm saying too  And Larry the cable guy  They all put out  A MySpace bullet 
[03:26:30]  And listen  And you get  Yeah  How many would it take  To get a fucking  Massive rally going on?  A couple hundred  Not many  Because you can't just have  One guy saying  I'm not paying  We're all going to get  Audited just for  Having this idea  Just for saying this  Out loud  What we think is crazy  Good one, Doug Stanhope  Way to go, Doug  Social security number  And that's how you get  That's how you get  A Ron Paul  Elected  Two  Alright, let's go to  Keith in North Carolina  Keith  Hey, what's up guys?  Hey, man  Hey, the  I got a call from Houston 
[03:27:00]  I used to live there  And the strippers in Houston  Had to go down  To the Harris County  Courthouse  And get a license  To strip  They had to wear  Their real name  And ID  Around their ankles  And if they don't  Have the license  They can't wear a thong  And so you know  The ones without the license  They're probably going  To put out  Because they can't  Afford the license  Wait, strippers have  A license now  On their ankles?  Yeah, they have to  Wear them in Houston  They have to wear them  With a picture ID  And if they get  Pulled over by the cops  They have to show them  Their driver's license  And their SOB license  They call it the SOB  But the hardest part 
[03:27:30]  About the stripper license  Is getting your  Abusive stepfather  To come down  And have his photo taken  That is weird  The cop pulls you over  He's like  You know  Your name  And bruised eye  Please  Keith in Louisville  What's up?  Hey, yeah  I just got back  From El Paso  And we got hit  With that $5  Stripper pole tax  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, so we just  Went across  To Juarez, Mexico  And watched  The stripper jack  Off a donkey  For like $5 
[03:28:00]  That's just to get  Them to run  That was their ride  This isn't even a show  This is just how  You crank start  Your ride home  Donkey won't budge  Donkey tax  This guy's saying  There's no pole tax  In Texas  Kevin  From  You know  Don King  In Austin  I've never  I've never heard  Of that tax  I've never seen  I go to strip clubs  Quite a bit  And plus  They don't wear  ID's around their ankle  So that's all bullshit  With the ID's  Around the ankle? 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, that's bullshit  Wait, what has  Stan got on this?  Stan's looking up  Some research here  I don't  Oh, wait, no  This says they're  Fighting it out  So let me get  A more updated thing  Because hopefully  The fight's over  No, it looks like  Texas ads  Yeah, Fox News  Texas ads  Pole tax to strip clubs  Wow  Pole tax?  What the fuck?  That's  They include it  In the door fee  I don't know  Tax, tax, tax  Tax enough  They just want  Some of that  Strip club money, man  Because there's  A lot of cash  In the strip clubs  A lot of cash 
[03:29:00]  Moving back and forth  So they're like  Fuck that  We want our piece  That's all it's about  Really  They just want  Their piece of the action  Donovan the trucker  What's up?  Well, yeah  That guy in Austin  Is out of his fucking mind  It's $5 to get in  And that's the tax  And they do  They make them wear  The thing on their ankle  Or on their thing  I live down in San Antonio  My sister-in-law  Is a bartender  $580 for the fucking  Stripper license  The SOB  $580? 
[03:29:30]  $580  And that's  That's why you start  Stripping  You don't show titties  Without a license  But you can't wear a thong  So the girls  Who don't show titties  And just get out there  And dance with a bikini on  Don't have the license  And they have to wear shoes  You can't be barefoot either  Unless you have the license  It's a health issue  It's a health issue  And they're fighting it  Yes  So I don't know  If it's all the way in effect  But yes  It's fucking real  Who's thinking this shit up?  Who's coming up with this shit?  In Alaska right now 
[03:30:00]  My best friend's a bartender  Up in Alaska  In Alaska  They have  Cops going into bars  Undercover  Or he serves  Hot toddy please  I'll have a hot toddy  Give me a hot toddy  Give me an HD please  They got undercover cops  Going into bars in Alaska  And looking for drunk people  And then pulling them out of the bar  Saying who over served you  We don't  We could arrest you  For being drunk in public  But we want to know  Who over served you  And they just point out a bartender  And they take the bartender out  In cuffs 
[03:30:30]  Wow  In Alaska  This is Alaska  The last frontier  Wild wild  Yeah  Which it used to  Not a handful of years ago  Five years ago  There were whorehouses  There were six whorehouses  I could stumble out of the bar  That I played  And go  Fuck a whore  And now  It's all done  Now you're fucking  Getting arrested  Alaska?  Yeah  It's fucking terrifying  In Texas  They were pulling people out of bars  What two years ago?  Just randomly drunk in public 
[03:31:00]  Arresting them  Hotel bar  They arrested I guess  A hotel bar  Yeah  One of them was  One of the bus was a hotel  Hotel bar  And they arrested a woman  For being drunk in public  She must have been  Fucking ugly  Ugly as sin  She must have just been  Blowing guys  In the lounge  Yeah what was she doing?  Come on  I mean  I want to go with you Doug  But she must have been  Just doing some horrific shit  Listen you motherfuckers  Right  I mean the fact that  She opened up her asshole  Nice and wide  For anyone that's around 
[03:31:30]  The fact that they would  Even attempt that  Shows it  Yeah  They had this thing in place  She was letting  All the bar patrons  Eat peanuts  Out of her pussy  At the bar  She kept her legs open  And had doodads in it  She was shooting them out  At patrons  I've never gone to a  Holiday Inn hotel lounge  Hey this place  Is way too rowdy  Let's go somewhere quiet  Why would you go to a  Holiday Inn hotel lounge  Unless you went to see  Voss perform on New Year's Eve  He's not even here  Stupid Rich Voss 
[03:32:00]  Don't fuck yourself  You and your tumor  Steve what's going on?  Hey guys  Good morning  Hey  Hey  I know this is an old question  But if this government  Is so money hungry  For everything  What if they legalize  Your pot  Just for the tax money  No one's ever said that  Before in their life  Wow  That's not a bad idea  Wow  That's an amazing idea  The guy admitted  Right off the bat  That he knows this  Is an old thing  I didn't hear him 
[03:32:30]  Say that part  It's a defeatist argument  I hate when they do that  Why don't we legalize  Prostitution and tax it  And we can wipe out  And legalize drugs  And tax it  How about legalize them  And don't tax them  You're already caving in  Ahead of time  Those things should be  Legal anyway  Because you own  Your own fucking body  So don't already  Offer up a tax  Before you start fighting  And people are  Under the impression  That if they legalize  Pot and tax it  Everyone's going to be  Driving around  It's just going to be  Another thing that's taxed  They're not going to have 
[03:33:00]  A balanced budget anyway  That they waste the money  You're not going to see it  It's not going to be  Hey look  The fucking  Look at this  We got the pot tax check  That we just received  From the government today  Hey if we discovered  Alcohol like this year  In the year 2008  You think it would be legal  I was thinking about this  Because like pot  And pot is evil  But pot is evil right  But recently I was in  Huntington for the  St. Paddy's Day parade  Right  And by 5 o'clock in the 
[03:33:30]  Afternoon on a Sunday  The whole fucking town  Was so goddamn ripped  People were almost  Getting run over by cars  Girls were stumbling  Around the street  Passed out on the side  Trying to eat pizza  Trying to get their shit  Back together  And you're like  This shit is legal  There's no way pot  Gets you more fucked up  Than booze  That's what I'm getting at  You look at what the alcohol  Has done in this country  What's the big deal  About the pot  Well the money already  Has roots in alcohol  It's like tobacco  It's too ingrained  In the society 
[03:34:00]  Where that money  Is already  Part of the ruling class  They tried to make it illegal  And that didn't work out  Too well  With what  Prohibition  Oh yeah of course  And it spawned  Organized crime  Like a motherfucker  If Pablo Escobar  Had been elected  As senator  Before they found out  What he was doing  Yeah then maybe  Cocaine would have  A way better shot  Of being legal  Because he's part  Of the ruling class  Same thing with cigarettes  If all of a sudden  We discovered cigarettes today  Right  Would that ever be legal  Are you kidding me  No  No  And salvia divinarum 
[03:34:30]  Which is a hallucinogen  That's like a ten minute  High that you wouldn't do  Recreationally  I did it once  And it ruined the  Natural buzz  I had going  Started drinking  And then I did  Smoke some salvia  And they're trying  To make that illegal  And it's just  Because kids are doing it  Like kids will spin around  In circles  Until they throw up  Just to feel differently  You know  Any kind of high  They'll make that illegal  Though eventually  You know  Because they can't  Tax it  Stop spinning  I want my spin tax 
[03:35:00]  And then I'll let you  Spin all you want  Yeah but it's just crazy  Because you see  Like alcohol  They glorify the shit  Out of that  And it's like  It's yeah  It's probably  One of the most  Dangerous drugs  You can be on  And it just  You can buy it anywhere  And it's advertised  Everywhere  I mean St. Paddy's Day  Is what next week  And right here  In New York City  You're going to see  So many fucking drunks  Getting the shit  Kicked out of them  All sorts of  Puking in the streets  All sorts of crazy  Shit's going to happen  And if  Again like 
[03:35:30]  Methamphetamine  People  It's rampant  Where if you  Offered them  Better drugs  You gave them  Mushrooms were out there  People would do mushrooms  Don't do that  Don't need to look like  You took a shotgun blast  To the head  Fucking crystal meth  Give them better drugs  Let's say hi to  Dave in Chicago  Dave what's up  Yeah hey  Doug is absolutely right  What they started doing  Down in Texas  A couple years ago  They send undercover cops  Into bars  And they target people  And they watch them  For about an hour 
[03:36:00]  And then see how much  How many drinks they've had  And then they go up to them  And make them  Blowing a breathalyzer  Not by their actions  Just by  You know the math  You know how much  They've had to drink  In an hour  And then they blow  Into breathalyzer  And then if they  They'll take a member  To chuckle public  If they blow more  In the .08  What the fuck  I blew into a breathalyzer  On last weekend  And not  I wasn't pulled over  Or arrested  It was recreation  It was like fun  Just for fun  Where was it  Some of the bars  Have it  In the men's room  Fuck 
[03:36:30]  There was no  Breathalyzer  Where was it  I really can't say  Oh I know  I know where you're going  I was fucking drunk  And I blew  A .07  And maybe  Two  Something like that  It was definitely not  You were still legal then  I was still legal  I could have driven  And I was fucking hammered  Wow  It made me confident though  Next time I have a good buzz on  I'm just gonna hop in the car  And drive home  Do you guys remember the bars 
[03:37:00]  That had the breathalyzers in them  Yep  And it just made you drink more  Cause then you and your buddies  Are trying to see who could blow up  It was a contest  Yeah  They actually put it in bars  Like as a responsibility  So you could like  Yeah and then you want to get high score  Yeah  And then you would replace high score  Instead of like using it responsibly  Dude you're a fucking pussy  Someone gave me one of those pocket breathalyzers  To carry around  And we brought it down to Costa Rica with us  I was blowing like three times the legal limit  When I woke up  Like eight hours sleep  And I'm blowing like .24 
[03:37:30]  Oh  Those are some long nights  Oh that is funny  God damn  That's gotta be a massive hangover  But it makes you realize  Like how many times was I driving over the limit  The next day  Oh yeah  Thinking you're  That's just a hangover you're smelling  Oh there are times  You're just gonna hammered  Like driving in the morning  When you're like  Oh boy  I'm still fucking drunk  Yeah  Should not fucking be driving  Alright  Wow a lot of phone calls  We'll go right back to the phones  Having a fine second half here 
[03:38:00]  On the O.P. and Anthony show  Yeah  Just had to get there  And talk about something  Big huge comeback  That's what radio's about  If you ask me  Doug Stanhope  At Caroline's  All weekend long  Here in New York City  212-757-4100  Yes Jimmy  Who?  Regular Joe  Regular Joe has something  Yeah well  You know I do radio  But people tell me  I got a face for radio  I know it's regular Joe  Jimmy  I do radio 
[03:38:30]  But people tell me  I got a face for radio  Shame  Shame  Shame  Shame  Shame on you  Last night I think I shit the bed  Got so drunk I gave a dude head  Life is just a merciful blur  When you pop a piss wasa  Piss wasa  Don't drink it slow  3 a.m.  Buy some flow  Sleep in the bathroom 
[03:39:00]  On the floor  What really matters  Anymore  All the crap you do  All day  Who fucking cares  Anyway  Piss wasa  This is fear  Drive drunk  All for fear  Piss wasa  Drink all day  It helps the trouble  All the way  Yeah yeah  Piss wasa  Cheap German lager  For export only  O.B. and Anthony  O.B. and Anthony 
[03:39:30]  Get in  It was awful  Worthless  They're the worst  Just screaming  Every racial epithet  You can think of  An abomination  It's the worst  Of the O.B. and Anthony  Show  Travis  I gotta hear this story  Yeah Travis  Almost got beat up  Or something  At Ikea  Yeah  Who gets into a fight  At Ikea  Nobody except  You're all fighting  Over that $100 couch  Are you and your  Life partner shopping 
[03:40:00]  Oh honey  A plastic coffee table  We need one of those  We bought all of our  Do you get it  Their stuff is cheap  It certainly is  So you're at Ikea  Yeah we're at Ikea  Cause we just moved  Into a new apartment  So you gotta go to Ikea  Yeah so you know  We need everything  Yeah  It's the poor man's  Verner store  Where you put it  Together yourself  With pins  And twisty latches  And not enough  Allen keys  That's all we did 
[03:40:30]  But it looked like  Wood on the box  And  It's pressed wood  On the press board  The press board  Who hasn't yelled  It's stripped  It's stripped  It's stripped out  And then you got  That one little latch  That keeps turning  And turning  Little screw  Oh yeah  Yeah  I had a couple of those  You gotta watch that  So we bought a lot of stuff  So we rented  A U-Haul van  To bring it back  From Long Island  Cause we went to the one  Out on Long Island  And  So we're carrying  All of our stuff 
[03:41:00]  Out to the  You know how they have  Kind of like a loading area  Yes  Where you have to bring your car  From the parking lot  And there's only certain  Amounts of spots  So a lot of people  Are holding spots  Waiting  You know  For somebody to go  Get the car  So we get all of our  Stuff out there  And I'm about to go  To get the U-Haul  And  This guy pulls in  To the spot  That my wife is  Holding  Uh oh  And she  Doesn't  She likes to speak her mind  She doesn't  She's not as diplomatic 
[03:41:30]  As she probably should be  Under certain circumstances  Exactly  Yeah  So the guy gets out  Of the car  What'd she say to him  Like she's standing  In the spot  She's standing outside  Of the spot  Like kind of like  On the sidewalk  We have what she said  You  So now she's outside  The spot  You're going to get 
[03:42:00]  Your car  You're still there  Yeah  I'm maybe like  Ten feet away  And then I hear her  Start telling this  Guy  Can I stop you  For one second  I hope the women  That are listening  Right now  Are listening very  Carefully  Yeah  Because we're going  To teach you  Something today  We're not as tough  As you think  As you think we are  Look at me  Right go ahead  Continue  So she starts  Telling this guy  Probably thought  You were a lamp  So she tells this guy  You know this is our spot  Where he's going  To get the van  And he's like 
[03:42:30]  I'm just going to be a minute  I'm just going to be a minute  I'm loading my stuff in  She's like  That's what these spots are for  So that we can load our stuff in  You have to wait  Just like everyone else  And he's like  I'm just going to be a minute  I'm just going to be a minute  Was he being rude to her?  He was being very short  Well the guy is being a tool  I'll give you that  Why would he pull in there  If you're already  Like waiting  You've got to wait your turn  Exactly  And she's showing  She's like  Look see  Other people are holding  Their spots  She's like  This isn't just something  You know  Like we're doing  Yeah  Let me ask one quick question  To Devil's Advocate 
[03:43:00]  Was his stuff ready to go  And he had his car there  While you still had to go  Get yours?  Yes  So maybe on a technicality  You were right  But she probably shouldn't  Engage the guy  If his stuff  You know why?  Because there would have  Been a problem  Let me tell you something  Quickly  Won't interrupt your story at all  I was  But you are  No  No  I was online  At the bank one day  And this chick had a tongue  I can't say online at the bank anymore  Without thinking that  I was online at the bank  And some guy goes  I'm in a big hurry 
[03:43:30]  Could I please just get in front of you  And I was like  Alright  Worst thing I could have said  He goes to the window  20 god damn minutes  He's trying to like  Cash drachma  Or something  And I'm sitting there  I could have been done  So no  You never let anyone in front of you  Ever  No no no  I don't even mean that  I think you're right  Shut up  I'm only saying though  Because if he had his van there  Almost like  And his stuff in his van  Like he was ready to load and go  What if something was missing?  What if something of his was broken? 
[03:44:00]  Now he's got to talk to the guy  About this  No  No  You were in line  You were right  Of course  A little more diplomacy perhaps  But  Something was missing  Travis's muscles  Any hint of masculinity  You should have seen me  Trying to carry some of this stuff  Oh my god  What the styrofoam peanuts?  The packing peanuts?  The bubble wrap?  So everything  Everything's kind of fine  And like  She kind of lets the situation go 
[03:44:30]  And  We kind of you know  Give in  Like just let this guy do his stuff  No  You gave in  She didn't give in  Well she's the only one fighting  I personally  Couldn't have cared  Well Travis is a man  And he understands the consequences  Of dealing with other men  Yes  So  Everything's fine  Until she  He turns around  And she says  Un-effing believable  And  You could see in his eyes  He  Oh  The switch  He's got that switch  And 
[03:45:00]  He runs up to her  And gets about a foot  Away from her  And starts pointing at her  Oh  Don't you  Don't you  You know  F and talk to me like that  Blah blah blah blah blah  And  Any good curses?  Yes  You know what you need?  What?  A gun  I do need a gun  If you would have pulled a gun out on him  He'd have shut the F right up  Right up  He was threatening my wife  With bodily harm  Was he threatening her  Or just yelling back  Doesn't matter  That close  He was  I perceived it as a threat 
[03:45:30]  He was way too close  He was ready to strangle her  I had to shoot him in the head  Ten times  You could tell that he was not  The type of person  That  Respected women  Okay  Was he on the show?  Hello  Yes  I had  I need my  Ikea furniture  Please  Listen you  So  I  So I jumped in the middle  Instinctively  Of course  Instinctively  Come on I know  I'm you know  I'm 125 pounds  As what prey? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah  Are you really 125 pounds?  I'm between 125  Aww  That's adorable  Little guy  Got a girlish figure  But  So I jumped in his face  Because  You know  Like it's your chick  You know  You're not gonna  Of course  You have to  Now you've been put in a position  Now you have to  Because she got you  In that position  Alright  So  I'm telling him  Not to talk to her like that  You know  Et cetera  Et cetera  He's saying  You know  He's saying  She shouldn't even be talking  To begin with  And she's  Shouldn't be talking? 
[03:46:30]  Yeah  And she's yelling at him  You know  Like the way he thinks  Yeah  She said  She shouldn't be talking at all  At all?  And she says  I'm a grown woman  MF her  Blah blah blah  He's like  Your husband's about to get his ass kicked  This and that  What a  Oh no  What a  This guy  Is nuts  I see it in his eyes  I'm like  I'm going to get my ass kicked  He's like  He's going to knock me out  I hate this guy  Yeah  I don't  No  I hate this guy  I don't agree with 
[03:47:00]  Your wife's tactics  I hate this guy too  But I hate this guy  Because if you were a bigger guy  He wouldn't have pulled that crap  No  No effing way  Yes he would  Why  Was he big?  No he wasn't  He wasn't  Uh oh  Uh oh  Wait a minute  Just tell me if I'm right  No  Like  Shut up  Well  Why don't you tell Jimmy to shut up?  I'm kidding  I love Jimmy  No he was  All right  So 
[03:47:30]  I  I  Calm the situation down  I  You know  Assure him that  I don't want any trouble  Oh  Because  Come on  I'm not going to get into a fight  It's not going to be a fight  You know  Oh  Oh  Your wife's not looking at you  The same way  Oh  Well  No  Not  No not even  Because  It's awful  At the end  You gotta leave that situation  Bleeding  Missing a few teams  Yep  Now you're  Now you're committed  No believe it or not  You have to  The only thing she was upset about  Was that I got involved at all 
[03:48:00]  Because she wanted to see  If he was going to hit her  Yeah  Here's exactly what happened  That kind of would have been cold  And you know  You could have had his furniture too  Yes  That guy's a creep  You're right  He's a complete  He's a ghoul  He's a bully  An ass bully  He is  But he's a nut  He's a nut  And I completely fault the woman  For saying something  I like you  She's a friend of mine  Yeah  I completely fault the woman  Because they get involved  On a level  Like that guy  Couldn't hit her  He wanted to hit her  Because he's arguing with her 
[03:48:30]  So he's got to say  Your husband's going to get his ass kicked  Yeah  But why did he have to say that  First of all  He's got no problem with Travis  At that point  He didn't  Travis is stepping in  In defense of his wife  And then he's like  Your husband's going to  Not even directing it to Travis  Like I'm going to kick your ass  If you don't keep her in line  It's  I'm going to  Your husband's going to get his ass kicked  How about  How about  My husband  Has a gun  Oh you've got to get armed  Armed citizenry  It's the only way  The Old West  It keeps going  Oh Christ no 
[03:49:00]  So I calm everything down  I go in  To get the last  You know  Truckload of furniture  That we have waiting inside Ikea  And he's finishing up  He was actually very quick  He's finishing putting his stuff in his truck  Good for him  And my wife  Oh no  God bless her  Oh no  Okay here's where it all turns around  To completely her fault  He's  He's getting in the car  It's over  And she says 
[03:49:30]  Happy Chinese New Year  Oh okay  That's nice  But it's not anywhere near there  He was an Asian  Oh okay  And he gets right out of his car again  And I turn to him and I'm like  What the F are you doing  Oh no  He comes right back  He says  You really want a problem  Don't you  And he's looking at me  He's not looking at her  Oh my  And I'm like  I do not want a problem  I was like  Just calm down  Everything 
[03:50:00]  I don't know what to say  Oh boy  Because you almost want to go  Go ahead  Do it  Do what you gotta do  Because  That just  That just  Did not have to be said  No you might have had to  Just lay him out  You might have just had a  Accept the fact  That your wife is wrong  But you might have had to just  Blindside him  With a kick to the groin  At that point  You close your eyes  And hope for the best  And just  Get that surprise shot  As far as you can  Because let me tell you  After part one of this  He didn't think you were going to do anything 
[03:50:30]  No  So his guard's down  You come upside his head  And just keep pounding  You have to  You left  Could you go back there  And pick up your genitalia  Because you left it  In the parking lot of Ikea  I disagree  I don't think Travis did  Travis is a small guy  He's not coming off  Like a tough guy  The other guy was a jerk  But when a woman  Runs their mouth  At a man  Like they put you 
[03:51:00]  In that position  And they do it  Women do it  They run their mouth  At men  Because they don't understand  The consequences  Of dealing with men  The way this guy  Dealt with that situation  Was wrong though  As a man  Whether he's a nut or not  Is wrong  I've been in that situation  With women  I told the story  About the movie theater  When that Hispanic woman  Went into battle mode  Because my girlfriend  Decided to tell her  To go F herself  Because she was making  Too much noise  They're quoting battle mode  On instant feedback  Battle mode  That's one thing  Because it's a woman 
[03:51:30]  And a woman  And they're yelling  At each other  And both of us men  Were like  The guy just looked at me  And went  Well she put her in battle mode  And I'm like  Alright it's two women  What are we going to do  But when a guy  Does something like that  To a woman  Whole nother story  You gotta throw  Out the window  Any reason and logic  On the part of  Maybe your wife was wrong  And do everything you can  To make sure she's okay  And stick up for it  Even if it means  Getting a punch to the face  I agree with you 
[03:52:00]  But like that guy  Was leaving  I'm not saying  That Travis Hill  His wife get hit  But I'm saying like  He didn't leave  His genitals anywhere  Because that guy  Was leaving  He was going  When it was all done  He didn't mother eff you  Leaving feeling like  He got away with something  Good for her  She should have  She should have done more  So what happened  If he felt like  He was getting away with something  He would have crap talked him  On the way out  No  But he didn't  He just left  No he left  He left really wanting  To kick my ass  But  See  Not  You know  And so she says that 
[03:52:30]  He comes back  He's  Every other word is  You know  He's just dropping F-bombs  You know  You want a problem  I'm gonna kick your ass  This other guy now  That was kind of like  You know how Ikea  Is kind of like a map  Where you go around  You know  And everyone  You're kind of  Never been there  I have no idea  What you're talking about  Poor person  This guy  This guy  Who we were kind of like  You know  Shopping near the entire time  Now he's out  And so he  Is defending 
[03:53:00]  Me now  He gets in this guy's face  Oh  And this guy  Just starts yelling  At the guy  Who's defending me  He's like  It's like my bodyguard  Yeah  This guy was nuts  He was looking  To just fight  He was a problem  Someone  Yeah  And so now  He realizes that  There's  Everybody's watching  And he gets in his car  Ah see  And also  Also it's one and a half  Versus two  Yes  One and a half  Wait one and a half  Thanks for the compliment  Versus two  Oh my god 
[03:53:30]  All right  Hold  Oh my god  Boo  Boo  Boo  See I should have went  One versus one  Oh  Yeah  I gotta go back to Betty  Bye  Oh  But I  No I  I'm not even  I know Travis  You gotta defend your woman  You have to man  But it's almost like  The fact that a woman  And this is all women  That do this  They would put their man  In a position  To have to be  Confrontated  Like do you know  Nothing about the animal kingdom  No no  You're right  You're right  That should never be done 
[03:54:00]  But once that line is crossed  You can't go back  You're past the point of no return  Patrice told a great story  Now you gotta be the guy  Yeah  But he was the guy  It doesn't mean punching the guy  Because he did diffuse  It got diffused  It got diffused  The only reason it got diffused  And I'm sorry Travis  Is because Travis  Completely backed down  To this guy  So what  The guy was in his face  He's  I don't wanna get a punch  And then you get to the point  Where you're going  I don't want any trouble  I don't want any trouble  It's like  Yeah I know  You don't  Because look at me 
[03:54:30]  You know  I know  And I'm sorry  For your little  Waif-like body  But it's like  At that point  You can't think about  Oh my god  What she did or said  You could yell  At her  When it's done  Oh could you yell  But at that time  You gotta  Defend  But he did  He stepped in between them  But why should I be  Responding  Why should I take a punch  For something  You should give a punch  I completely agree  When that guy starts  With his effing  And this and that  And the other thing  That's tough  Bam  That's tough not to 
[03:55:00]  You were being assaulted  You were being assaulted  Yeah  Didn't she yell  Something racist  At the guy  On the way into the car  When it was over  What  Absolutely not  She wished him  A happy new year  That is true  What the hell  That was kinda nice  What she's supposed  To know what  Day that is  It was our new year  Recently  What the hell  Shouldn't she say that  Women have that  Protective thing  Of men are not  Supposed to hit us  And they deep down  Never believe that they will  They don't understand  What they think they do  But they really don't  They don't 
[03:55:30]  Chivalry  There's our music  And honor  I don't think Travis  Lost his  I think he did the right thing  He stepped in  Oh we lost that years ago  I'm kidding  This is George Romero  You're listening to  The worst of Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Travis' story got us all talking  During the walkover 
[03:56:00]  Certainly did  And I agree with Jimmy  Wholeheartedly  That that would probably  Cause a little rift  Between you and your girl  But on the other hand  I think  I don't know  As a guy  You're in  You have no choice  You gotta go into  Freaking fight mode  You wanna  You wanna keep  From having to do that  Up until the point  Where you cross that boundary  Where the guy then  Confronts your chick  Then you're obligated  As a guy  To step in  And defend her 
[03:56:30]  You could  You could use diplomacy  At the very beginning  To see like  Hey what's going on here  Kind of thing  And maybe  That  Will  Sort it out  Or help to  To bring it  About  About a peaceful ending  But if the guy's  In her face  Pointing  From a foot away  Yelling at  At her  And  You gotta punch him  It doesn't matter  Who's right or wrong  Also add that  The guy got in  Travis' face  And go  And said something like  You really want a problem  Yeah  Travis  I know what you guys are saying  But Travis did step 
[03:57:00]  In front of his girl  He stepped in front of  His girl  Yeah but stepping in front of  And then the guy  Threatening  Him  Like that  It's  And the only thing  Travis was  He backed down enough  Where the guy was like  Alright I'm satisfied  I'm satisfied  I showed him  You can't let him  Walk away like that  That guy should have been  Decked on the friggin pavement  In the Ikea parking lot  With his cheesy furniture  Sitting up on the loading dock  I disagree  Because the guy was obviously 
[03:57:30]  Like you know how you pick up  A sense  The guy was a problem  There was something  Like he was like  One of those guys  That was gonna snap  And it's almost like  You always read stories  And this was an avoidable  Confrontation  Yeah  You read stories about people  That get shot over parking spaces  Sure  Or stupid Travis  Would be laying there  With a busted jaw  Missing teeth  But he would still have a sex life  But then his wife's gonna go  Wow  But then you sure have something  To hold over her head  Go look at what I did  Yeah then you feel worse  Like I tried to stand up  For my girl  And I got the shit beat out of me  At least this way you stepped 
[03:58:00]  I think Travis did the right thing  Because it's not like  She said sir  Could you do something  And then the guy motherfucked her  That's different  That's a hundred percent different  Where your rage should come up  Where you should be in  Fucking fight mode  But it wasn't like  She was being polite  And said hey look  Like the guy actually  Even though he was maybe  Being a dick  So like I'm just gonna be a minute  And whatever  Was running in  And Travis didn't even have  The car yet  And that guy was a  Fucking problem  Because the other guy  Stepped in  And the guy didn't back off  He was like one of those guys  Right  Who the fuck knows  What's going on with him  It's like you gotta think  That you're dealing with other men 
[03:58:30]  And the woman provoked it  To that point  And then the guy's gonna leave  And he didn't point at Travis  And say fuck you fat  He didn't say anything right  He was just getting in the truck  To go  He was done  Yeah um  Am I  Okay  Yeah  You're on  Poor Travis  Yeah you're on  You nervous Nelly  I'm not nervous  Oh poor Travis  In three years  I'm not nervous  Yeah  Yeah she  Yeah you're not nervous  He was  Shut up  No I'm just  I wanna make sure  That I get this story correct 
[03:59:00]  Because apparently  I missed a little part  Oh  Okay  Clear it up  Where he came back  And started  With nunchucks  And no  Yeah right  Now I forgot where we were  He came back  And uh  And started with her again  While I was inside the Ikea  Oh  And  Now why the fuck  Did he do that  I don't  I was inside the Ikea  This little dick motherfucker  That just  Had to 
[03:59:30]  Had to have a big day for himself  Over at Ikea  And I come back out  Fuck you  I come back out  And he's getting into his car  And I said you know  You really shouldn't talk to women like that  Yeah  And he got back out of the car  And  Tried to you know  The guy was a problem  Like Jim keeps saying  He was looking for a fight  So  He keeps you know  Motherfucking me  Telling me  I'm gonna get my ass kicked  Etcetera  Etcetera  And the situation  Calmed down again  I don't know how I calmed down  The situation  But like  I didn't want to get into a fight 
[04:00:00]  Because  He didn't either actually  He would've just punched you in the face  Exactly  Bruce Lee  Or odd job  What body size  Uh  Probably more Bruce Lee  Yeah  Yeah way more Bruce Lee  This is a culture that shrinks  Through women's feet  Right  So a woman backtalking him  That's a  Exactly  I'm not saying he's not a cunt  The guy is  The guy probably should be  Backed over  The guy was fine  Until  She cursed at him  Like  She didn't say anything  Like  Until she said  Un-fucking-believable  Yeah 
[04:00:30]  He was fine  And he didn't say  Hey  She didn't say  Hey fuck you  Yeah  She just  The situation  Un-fucking-believable  She just said  Un-fucking-believable  And then he's got to get out  And he said  What did you say  And she said  It's just unbelievable  How some people are in this world  You want to hear a funny story  Well how are you doing  He doesn't know the story  Ready for you yet  Can't eat  Sit there  Hold tight  Don't worry  I got it  Alright  There's a reason you're sitting  Let it be direct  Don't worry  We'll get to you  You dope  I gotta get the smoothies 
[04:01:00]  Like the smoothies  Are the most important thing  When the fans are downstairs  Freezing  Well have Paul go grab them  He's not doing anything else  Kenny is an OCD freak  And he's got a list of things  That he just  Constantly needs to check off  And he's freaking out  And the longer he waits  Between checking off stuff  He gets freaked out  Yeah  And makes him babble  And fuck up the whole timing  Of a radio show  Yeah  Kenny  That's a big story  That was like comic relief  Without the comic  And it wasn't relieving at all 
[04:01:30]  Go ahead Travis  What were you saying  Before a man interrupted you  She said that  That he had spoken to her  When you were inside  Yeah  And I came back outside  And he was getting into his van  And I told him  That he really shouldn't  Talk to women like that  And he got back out of his van  And got back into both of our faces  And he said  She shouldn't be talking at all  And then she said  At all  Yeah  And she said  I'm a grown fucking woman 
[04:02:00]  I'll talk whenever I want  Yeah  I can say whatever I want  I'm a grown woman  Which she's right  When he said  She shouldn't be talking at all  Then I knew what I was dealing with  Oh maybe he said that  Because she's Canadian  Maybe  Good point  Why didn't you punch this guy  Really  The guy needed a fist in the face  I'm sorry Jimmy  He needed to be blindsided  When he was talking  And thinking he had it all  Because it looks to me  Was he in a posture  That looked like he was going to punch 
[04:02:30]  Absolutely  You should have fucking wailed him  Just wail him right in the fucking ear  Take your  So he goes  Bong  Ring his bell  Take your plastic  Plastic furniture  And hit him over the head with it  Yeah  Maybe I'm not saying you're wrong  Maybe I should have  No I don't think you should have at all  No  Oh you  No  Yeah  Wow  It's macho to say you should have  No I know  And if a guy is physically threatening your woman  You absolutely  You should bite him  I'm not saying that you shouldn't  Ferociously defend the person you're with 
[04:03:00]  In that situation  I would be so  Angry at my girl  Because if the guy  Because that guy was acting like a douchebag  More important than they were  He was more fucking important than they were  To get his furniture first  Fuck him  You're right  Fuck everybody that thinks like that too  You're more fucking important  Go fucking screw man  You're right  That guy needed a punch before anyone said a word  You're right  Douchebag  You're looking at it from the point of view of like  I don't want to be bullied either  But that guy  If a guy has a fucking problem 
[04:03:30]  And there are people in the world that are just like that  Everyone's got problems  You just  Travis did the right thing  Because he would have been laying in the hospital pot with a broken jaw  It's stupid  Or the other guy would have been sitting there going  With his van spray painting with fucking symbols  No one understands  I hope his grandma gets hit crossing the street  Somewhere on Mott  That's hitting a very personal thing for Anthony  They're constantly getting run over up there  Down there  Kenny do you have a story? 
[04:04:00]  Oh  Hey funny you should ask  It's kind of anti-climactic though  After his terrific story  We're climactic  But climactic  Whatever  Whatever  No  Like et cetera et cetera  Over there  Me and Jimmy  Ephedra et cetera  Me and Jimmy had a similar situation  But Jimmy played the role of the woman  Ah  Please feel free to  Let's get this one out on the table  Go ahead go  Oh shit 
[04:04:30]  Go ahead  I look forward to this one  Oh shit  Jimmy's winding up  Oh no  Go ahead  All right  This story has some legs  Yeah  No we were  We were at this club  And Jimmy's been playing these  Like small  Outer way  Shit houses  Yeah  To work on all this new material  He's got an hour of great material now  Since his HBO special  So we were leaving this place  And there was a pizza delivery guy  Parked in the fire lane  Blocking us in  All right  I tried to pull out 
[04:05:00]  I couldn't pull out  I tried again  I couldn't pull out  So I go in the place  To look for the guy  I find the guy  It's in between shows  And we're gonna go back to the hotel  For a little while  I like to go back  Relax for a bit  And then come back for the late show  So we're on a time schedule  Right  Yeah the sooner you get back  The more time you have to relax  Yes in between shows  Understand  So I go in the place  I find a mope  And you gotta realize  Like it's like a  A 40 year old loser  Probably like  Lives at home with his parents  You know minimum wage 
[04:05:30]  Fat  Delivering pizza  Yeah  Fat ugly  Nobody  You know exactly  Stuck in this  You know shit hole  Of a town  Just miserable  Yeah  Yeah yeah  I went to Jimmy's show  No no  He was delivering pizza  Delivering pizzas  You know  To the hotel  I was working in a hotel  I was working in a hotel  I was working in a hotel  Yeah  So I go  Look pal  Can you do me a favor  Are you blocking  He goes  I'm not blocking anybody  And so right away  He's like arguing  I'm not blocking  No you are  I go yeah  I can't get out  Could you just  Are you done  Could you move 
[04:06:00]  And he's insisting  He's not blocking anybody in  So like  Probably nobody even like  Talks to this guy  Yeah  Other than like  Give him the address  To deliver a pizza  Sure  So now  Like he's got an audience  And he's got a little bit  Of the upper hand  So like  He's busting my chops  Like I can't believe  I'm not blocking anybody in  I know I'm not blocking anybody  I go look  You're blocking me in  So I'm just like  Letting him ramble on  Cause we're walking  Like we're making progress  Right 
[04:06:30]  So we get out now  And now he proceeds  To show me  How like  How stupid I am  That I can't get out  Instead of just moving  The fucking car  Right  Right  Right  So Jimmy's sitting  In the car waiting  Alright  And all of a sudden  You know  He just starts screaming  At the guy  Out of the window  I'll tell you why  I'll tell you why  You're forgetting one line here  Alright  Okay but I'm the woman  Meanwhile  Meanwhile  This cuckold  Has been  Knocked around  By the fat pizza guy 
[04:07:00]  I'm in the truck  And I can see the guy  Is on nobody  It's not like  Because Kenny  Can't murder the guy  And that annoyed me too  Is that this guy  Is talking to a guy  At Kenny's side  With that phony  Fucking feeling  Of protection  Yeah  Like he won't hit me  Because we're civilized  And Kenny was being polite  Kenny was being polite  And then I hear the guy go  Well how could you not back out  I mean you're a man  I could see if you were a woman  And you couldn't back out  But you're a man aren't you  That's what he said  Oh  And I'm like  Would you move the fucking car  I screamed from the passenger  But it wasn't like 
[04:07:30]  He was some big guy  That Kenny was trying  He was a fat nobody  Who was shit talking Kenny  Yeah  And it annoyed me  I never shit talk  With bigger guys around me  And I was so aggravated  And the guy's like  Don't curse  I won't move the car  And I'm like  Oh that car will fucking  Move the fucking car  That's what I said  I'll fucking  I'll run this thing  I'll run it over  I was so aggravated  Oh I hate people  I fucking hate people  And the bottom line is  So the guy moved the car  And me and the guy  Just started screaming at each other  But I wasn't out of the car 
[04:08:00]  In the guy's face  What's he gonna do  I mean I knew he was gonna do nothing  Just call him a fat fuck  Yeah I think I did  I screamed at him  Again  Fuck you  Because then the guy's  Yelling at me like  If he doesn't shut up  I'm not moving  But it's not like  The guy was being polite  And I was just yelling  When he said to Kenny  Well if you see  If you were a woman  You don't know how to draw  I wanted to fucking smash him  So nobody was  So I'm being the woman  I'm like  Will you untuck your dick  And tell him to move  That fucking car 
[04:08:30]  Kenny has a weird sensibility  Because he can kill the guy  Yeah he lets people  Like when we're driving  In the morning  I see people do  Ridiculous stuff  With their cars  Cutting us off  And Kenny's just like  Oh look at that guy  I'm like look at that guy  Get out and beat him up  Kenny has a murderous confidence  Do something  Yeah  Because he's armed  Like I've never  I don't  Like when I'm with Kenny  It's good to have him there  And stuff  But I don't fucking  Is it really?  Let's be honest  I mean personality wise  It's horrendous  Right alright  It's like dragging  A bag of fish around 
[04:09:00]  Thank you  Let's finally put it on the table  Is he really that much fun  To be around?  No no no  Not at all  It's like bringing  If you need a cough syrup  He's great  He's the man  Let's actually have  A one on one conversation  With about something  Going on with your  In your life  I agree  I should be  I should be seen  And not heard  But did I ever start  A fight with anybody  On the road  Did I ever start  No  See no  I'm with a big guy  Who's armed  And I still would never  But that little fat guy  Yeah  Fuck it  And I wouldn't put Kenny  In a position  Where he had to get  Into a fight 
[04:09:30]  For me  Unless the guy  Started  Like if that was  A big guy  And they were having  That discussion  I mean I know  Kenny can do  I would've just  Fucked  I never would've  Shit talked  But I saw  He's this little  Fat cunt  And it drove me nuts  So Kenny  Sorry  I know you're  Why was Jimmy  The woman?  No I was just saying  Cause like he  He was yelling  And antagonizing the guy  When like  Like I was making  Progress with the guy  Progress  No the guy  Didn't deserve  For you to make progress  You don't make any progress  What I read also  Is I won't move my car  It wasn't even like  I'm gonna kick your ass 
[04:10:00]  Or his ass  Or something  I won't move the car  That's when you just go  Or lift up your jacket  For a split second  Cause I'm not ending up in jail  Not allowed to brandish  You know I could've  I could've beat that guy  To death  It's illegal  But who's looking  Yeah  It comes from the school  Of who's looking  And we knew  Kenny could beat him to death  And that guy  Whatever he was doing  That phony over  I fucking hated him for that 
[04:10:30]  Cause Kenny wasn't being rude to him  Yeah  As polite as Kenny  Cause the guy was wrong  Instead of just going  Wow  This guy's 6'6  And fucking  Borderline retarded  No offense  But people who don't know you  Think you're retarded  Yeah  It's like Lenny  From A Pice and Men  Going could you move your car  It was the battle of retards  Cause that guy was obviously  You know  Yeah  It was probably  Something wrong  If he's 40  Delivering pizzas  I think people think that  Cause of the small head Kenny  Yeah  Yeah no I got  It comes to a point almost  I got a very small head  Cause I got very little brains in them 
[04:11:00]  If you had a shaved head  It would be a little creepy  For everybody  Yeah  The hair makes it look like  It's a little bigger up top  Yeah  I just don't like  But that's what drove me nuts  Was the way that guy was  I don't like people  That are  Phony bullies  It's phony bullies  I agree  Bullies are one thing  Bullies  You can't really fuck with  You're gonna get your ass  Handed to you  Absolutely  And usually it's  Mono-y-mono  Kind of a thing  You know  It's a situation that happens  When your chick is involved  Like I said  All bets are off 
[04:11:30]  You gotta do what you gotta  Fucking do  But it's not like  The guy touched her  When one would get  Close enough dude  Close enough to  Fucking spit rice in her face  Dude I've been that angry  At somebody  Like if some woman  Was doing that  And I was in a rage  For some reason man  I would want to yell at her  Why don't we get  Travis's wife on the line  Okay  Ask Lisa if Travis  Is leaving something out  What aunt?  I'm gonna go get  Would you  No it's a mic call  Saying menacing is a crime  Of course it is 
[04:12:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  Menacing  Lisa  Yeah  What do you got to add  To this whole thing?  Okay  What do I have  Oh what do I have to add?  Oh sorry  It's really  Okay  Nothing  I was just gonna say  Like this guy  Was right up in my face  And yes I did  Yell at Travis  I'm sure he mentioned  Because I wanted to see  If he was gonna do anything  Like he  Literally like aunt said  Spitting rice in my face  Well hold on  Hold on  Right there  Wait you said  You yelled at Travis too?  Yeah because she didn't 
[04:12:30]  Want me to get involved  Right  She wanted to see  If he was going to  Hit her  She just said  I wanted to see  If he was gonna do anything  So now what she was doing  Is she is testing another man  And at what kind of position  Does that put Travis in?  He has to jump in  And he did  But this isn't at the point  She didn't get out of the car  Going  I'm gonna test the guy today  And see if I can get punched  He already had started  His fucking phony bullshit with her  Exactly  But Lisa  When you were pushing him  Like did you not read the fact  Like because Travis saw the fact  That the guy was a problem 
[04:13:00]  And there are men that are  There's like weird things  Like the guy was obviously  A fucking  He was  He was fighting the urge  To probably do something  Really stupid  Yeah  Although Travis didn't have a chance  To see that he was a problem  Until he was already a problem  Right  Like this all happened  Very quickly  I was really polite  Like I went up to the car  And I was like  Sir you know  We're waiting for this spot  We're gonna pull in  And he starts flipping out  Right away  Like within 10 seconds  He was in my face  And Travis was like  Probably about 25 feet away  Getting a cart 
[04:13:30]  To bring over  So he abandoned the cart  And came running  Like there was no time  For like assessing  What this guy was gonna do  Was he in your face at first  Or did he say  I wanna  I'm just gonna be  A couple of minutes  And then you were kinda like  When you said  Un-fucking-believable  Then he got kinda crazy  He was about  20 feet from me  When I like  Looked at  I was kinda looking  In Travis's direction  Cause he was further  Than the guy  And I just went  Like threw my arms up  And I was like  Un-fucking-believable  And then he comes  Running back at me  With his finger out  So that's none of his  Fucking business right there 
[04:14:00]  Of course  She's addressing Travis  Like this situation  Is un-fucking-believable  I'm not saying  The guy's not a prick either  He comes into his finger  Pointed in my face  And he's like  You don't fucking say that  You don't fucking open your mouth  You don't fucking talk like that  And I'm like  Excuse me  I'm a grown woman  You don't tell me  How to talk sir  Like what are you kidding me  And then he got even  Like more in my face  Here's something else  Jumped in  I don't think Jimmy understands  Because you're a peaceful guy  You don't  Peaceful  Are you kidding me  No you're  Wow  What a bad  That was a very big  Misinterpretation  I've never heard 
[04:14:30]  Any physical  Are you under the influence  Right now or something  I've never heard  Any physical violence  No no  That's stupid  You don't get in fights  With people and stuff  So you saying  That this guy's a problem  And you don't deal with people  That are problems  You being you  Anyone  That comes up to you  And wants to fight you  Is a problem  Because you don't put out  This vibe  And you don't  Make situations  Where people that aren't  Problems  Are going to want to hit you  So it's almost 
[04:15:00]  Inconsequential  To say  The guy's a problem  If a guy is  Fucking in your wife's face  Yelling  He's a problem  But that's just  The way  These people are  I don't mean  Just a problem  Like that  Like because again  Don't forget  I mean on a nightly basis  You fucking make  Snap judgments  When dealing with people  Like when they're talking  Or heckling  Like immediately  You're sizing people up  And you  You get a really weird feeling  Like is there a violence potential  Because then you got to  Turn your face this way  And have something thrown at you  So you're always  Personally I'm always 
[04:15:30]  Dealing with people  And you have to make  Very quick decisions  And you kind of know  That this guy is for real  And this is going to get  Fucking ugly  So I'll attack a certain  Whatever  So to me a problem  Is not a guy that reacts  Aggressively when you're arguing  A problem goes beyond that  Like a guy who is  Looking for something  Like I'm not talking about  Just two people being  Pissed off at each other  I'm talking about  Like what he saw  Which I believe  There's something in his eyes  There's something in the eyes  Which is just beyond  Like you fucking  You saw the eyes?  That race  If I can jump in for a second  I don't even think 
[04:16:00]  This guy was like  Like intending to be a problem  When he started  I think it was more that  He was on the defensive  Like he knew he was  Doing something wrong  To piss somebody else off  And was just like  Got very defensive about it  Because I mean  At one point  When he came back  And started harassing us again  He had his key  In his fist  Like ready to attack Travis  Oh the old key  In the fist gag  That means he couldn't fight  Travis  I didn't see a key  Hey Lisa  I gotta ask this question 
[04:16:30]  Because I really  I really don't know  The answer to this  Because I haven't been  In that situation  But as a woman  Were you hoping  Travis was gonna punch this guy?  No absolutely not  Okay  Because I mean  Baby I love you and all  But Travis is the biggest guy  I've already said it  What do you think  Wait wait go ahead  Anyway I was gonna say  Travis isn't the biggest guy  So I kind of felt  More confident  In like taking a hit  If need be  Because  Oh wow  Then you're mad  Taking the guy on 
[04:17:00]  Oh is that sad  Did you hear that Travis  I hope you did  I heard  I heard  Wait wait  Let's slow down  Can you explain to Travis  Just in case he doesn't  Understand what he said  Well your wife is saying  That she's better suited  To take a punch than you  That's pretty much  What she said  In playing Canadian  And now that explains  The beard that you have grown  The very full  I look tougher beard  There's nothing  Like it's two guys fighting  Big deal  But if a man and a woman 
[04:17:30]  Are in a verbal squabble  And the woman gets hit  That's a big deal  That means other people  Are jumping in  Well that is true  I will give you that  Yeah but your husband jumped in  I get to sue his ass  And I can lose the money right now  To me right now  What you're doing  I think Lisa is giving  A nicer version  Because she's calm now  But I think that  When you're arguing  With a guy like that  And it's not just  I think you're putting  Him in a very  Travis in a very bad position  That could be avoided  That easily could be avoided  By giving him 
[04:18:00]  His parking space  Being shit on  And stepped on  By a bully  But it's not that  By a fucking bully  Who had a bad day  Because his cunt  Fucking wife  Is at home  And he's got to go to Ikea  And pick the shit up himself  Fuck that asshole  I do agree  Fuck him  I agree with you  His wife was actually there too  Oh  Well what  You guys should have  Should have gotten in her face  A tag team  You should have taken on the wife  Yeah  In a tag team match  We're going to Ikea  And you're gonna catch hell  No chance in hell 
[04:18:30]  That's right  Tsukiyama  Is gonna be in his van  With Ikea furniture  It's an Ikea match  And the Canadian bruiser Lisa  You realize you put Travis  In a little danger there right  Little bit  Nope  No  Anyway  Maybe a little bit  Little bit  Little bit  Little bit  Well she said  She said at the end 
[04:19:00]  She's like  I understand  That you jumped in  I didn't want you to  But  You know  At least she understands  That instinctively  That's what a guy  Has to do  Of course  And saying happy Chinese New Year  I mean that's just  Like I know  Anthony you're right  The guy is a piece of shit  I'm not saying he's not  Yeah  It's nothing to do with that  That's irrelevant  But if the guy's a fucking problem  All the  Well he's this and he's wrong  It doesn't matter  When you're fucking  When a guy pulls out a pistol  It's like people have  That's a different story  People have this veil  Of I'm going to be safe 
[04:19:30]  And I'm not saying  You can't fight  If you have to fight  But when it can be avoided  With a guy that you sense  Is a real problem  Why wouldn't you avoid it  Because I hate  The thought of them leaving  Thinking they fucking  Won one over you  I agree  Jim  I can't  Fucking  I will  For a month  I'll be biting  My own fucking cheek  That's what she said  I agree  But you know what  I would rather have that  Than how many stories  Have you read about  Just guys that pull out pistols  I mean god bless you  And you're not wrong  But man when you're  In that situation  It's really tough 
[04:20:00]  To take on your  On your philosophy  Better draw fast  I'd slam that guy's door  In the cab  You know a week or so ago  He could have had a gun  He could have had a knife  But I was so enraged  That yeah  The smart thing  Would be to walk away  I will not disagree  With that  But when you're  In that situation  You're like  I gotta fucking  Do something now  I'm not  But he did the right thing  And then nothing happened  I'm not a pacifist  I'm not saying  You don't fucking  Fight a guy  If he's in your woman's face  But I'm saying  She I think 
[04:20:30]  Was being very aggressive  And pissed  Okay fine  She doesn't take any shit  But not reading that guy well  Like not being perceptive enough  To read what that situation was  Something happened  Bully went home  Feeling he won  Exactly  So he can  So he can bully another day  But a bully  He might have done that  He might have done that  To a guy who was 6'5  That's what I'm saying  Like a guy who was a problem  Is not really looking  To pick on someone smaller  Like because what he was doing  Like he was threatening the man  Like do you understand  What I'm saying  He might have done  I agree with you 
[04:21:00]  But at the same time  Like when that other guy  Jumped in at the end  Oh he went after him too  Yeah he went right after him too  He was  He would have taken on everyone  That's what I'm saying  This is not about right and wrong  This is not about being a man  When's the last time  Anybody in this room  Had a fight  You avoid it when possible  Like when you're driving  You think I don't want  To fucking run people  I had to bite my arm one time  Because I wanted to run  Somebody over  I physically wanted  To run them over  It's stupid  Yeah  But you know what I mean  It's not about  Hey guys walk away  When you have to 
[04:21:30]  But I'm saying  Is when your woman  Is arguing with a guy  Who she's not understanding  What the situation is  I'm not talking about  When your woman  I fully understood  What the situation was  And believe me  I didn't fight  To my full potential either  Like I toned myself down  I'm a hothead  I can't help myself  Okay but you're saying  Like what  You're saying  What do I  I wanted to see  What he would do  Poor Travis  That's that veil of protection  That that pizza guy had  When talking to Kenny  That's that veil  That weird veil  That people have  Where they think 
[04:22:00]  Nothing can happen to them  And it's like  People get shot over shit  Like that guy  Did he understand  Who he was fucking  Shit talking  No  Like when he was talking to Kenny  Could have disassembled him  Right there  It wasn't about  That guy's brave enough  To fight Kenny  If he's in a rage  It was about that guy  Thinking he had some kind  Of a protective fucking shield  In front of him  It's like when  You know  It'd be like  It's just  Yeah people do  In real situations  When it's not a movie  Or some article you're reading  They do think  That they're impervious  That's what I mean 
[04:22:30]  But  There are certain  Situations  Where  That takes a back seat  You're right  You're right  And  Before the confrontation  Obviously  Lisa shouldn't have  Mouthed off to  A nut  Right  But once it happens  You're past the point  Of  Returning back  To her  Not saying something  So now you have to  You're in a new situation  You're in defense mode  Yes  And you're in 
[04:23:00]  This guy  Is a fucking asshole  And  If he's  Gonna  If there's an inkling  He's gonna punch me  You gotta get him first  I agree  I completely agree  But what Travis saw  Was a fucking guy  Who was a problem  And then you're in defense mode  Of course  But like  Why not defuse the situation  Because first of all  If the guy  By apologizing  To this  He didn't apologize  That wanted to fucking  He didn't apologize  He didn't apologize  He didn't apologize  He just defused the situation  Saying sir  I don't want a problem with you 
[04:23:30]  And stuff  Is  I didn't apologize for my wife  I didn't say  She shouldn't be talking like that  You're completely right  He just defused the fucking  What could have been  A violent situation  Against him  That he would have lost  No offense  But he probably would have lost  That situation  Because that guy was in a rage  And he wasn't  Let's go to Carl in Jersey  Carl what's up  Hey what's happening  I walked over  With you guys one day  It was just Jimmy  And Kenny  And Anthony  And a cab  Got real close to Jimmy's leg  And Jimmy like  Spits either on the front of the cab 
[04:24:00]  Or in front of the cab  And so I tell the guy  What are you gonna do  What  What  Come on  And the guy  Inched the cab  A little forward  Towards his knee  I just wonder  What would have happened  If the guy  Would have just stepped on the gas  Well okay  Maybe I did something stupid  Or I'm not saying  I've never been guilty of it  Oh  And what if that guy  Would have just punched Lisa  Right in the head  And just drove away  But that's the point  I'm making too  Is that you  In a weird way  Like if he  Say you would have  Knocked Travis out  And then punched her  It's almost like  It's an avoidable situation  With a guy  Who's a fucking 
[04:24:30]  A nut  And if you send  Somebody who's a nut  You know  So send him off  To be a nut  To other people too  Fuck it  But it's like  What's the  I mean  Aside from the emotion  Because I feel the same  What you do  Fuck that  What's the point  Not going home  With your stomach  In a knot  That you didn't  Fucking punch this idiot  That you didn't  Leave him  Sitting on the ground  And sitting on the  Fucking parking lot  Of Ikea  On the ground  With you driving home  In your van  Laughing with your chick  Instead of him  Laughing with his 
[04:25:00]  Fucking  Bound foot chick  As they laugh  About how they  Got away  With fucking  You know  No one  Pulls one over  On me  Look what I did  Fuck him  Leave him bleeding  Fight dirty too  Kick him in the balls  And then bite his ear off  Fuck him  Ant's a small guy  Ant's a small guy  Has dealt with these  Fucking bullies  Dude I'm huge  Look at my pipes  You wouldn't have said this  Before he started  But no but I'm saying  This is  I got roid rage  He's got that rage  He's not going to 
[04:25:30]  Ever be bullied again  He would shoot somebody  Before he allowed them  Absolutely  But that's a reaction  I'll go to prison first  But that shouldn't  Skewer your judgment  I'll get fucked in the ass  Just so I can prove a point  But you  Remember when  Yeah that's isolated  Thanks  Remember when you and your chick  Had that problem  And you got annoyed at her  For running her mouth  You both  You moved seats  Yes  You moved seats  You didn't stand up and say  Girl on girl  No no but I'm saying  I couldn't do anything  You also saw that the guys  Were going to be  It was a whole fucking thing  That was going to happen  That wasn't necessary  If you just moved  Like if you just 
[04:26:00]  Because technically  Your girl was in the right  Because the other bitch  Was talking  Yeah  So it's almost like  But me and the guy  Had like this camaraderie going  We were like  Because he was like  Oh shit  She put her in battle mode  And I'm like  Yeah  Now you know  We got to watch  As our chicks duke it out  He didn't want any part  Of getting into a fight  With me or  My girlfriend  Of course not  But I couldn't help  My girlfriend out  And this big  Puerto Rican woman  Was going to  Fucking tear the shit  Out of my girlfriend  So that's why  We got up 
[04:26:30]  And left  Okay  Because you saw  That it was a problem  No win scenario  No no  But you saw  It was a problem  And it was able  To be diffused  You didn't run away  With your tail  Between your legs  You avoided  Fucking having a fist fight  In a movie theater  You're 40  Who was I punching  When the girls  Get into it  You would have  You had to pull the girl  Off you  Would have had to  Pull them apart  Yeah you would have  Had to  Something would have  Gone on  It would have gotten  Ugly  And you sensed that  But it wasn't a guy  When it's a guy  Coming up to your girl  That's a fucking issue  This is a bully 
[04:27:00]  A fucking  Yeah  They call us  Misogynistic  That's a girl  A woman hater  Who's there with his  Fucking submissive wife  Who probably fucking  Walks on those  Wooden shoes  They have a paper house  You moved  Like you made the right move  Because technically  You guys were in the right  That bitch was yapping  And your chick  Was kind of like that  Like right to go  What the fuck  Alright  Let me jump in here  Because let me ask Jimmy this  Would you ever  Ever 
[04:27:30]  Would you ever  Like have to hit a guy  That was getting  In the face of your chick  Without a doubt  Of course I would  Yeah because I mean  You're both sort of right  Like I think every guy  You know sizes up  The situation  I admitted that  Yesterday  I've told some crazy  Stories on this show  But like the dumb  Frenchman underwater  I knew I could take  The guy  Especially in those rules  The guy that I slammed  His leg  You're standing on earth  The guy where I slammed  His leg with the cab  You know the cab door  I knew I could take him  But if it's some big 
[04:28:00]  Huge 6'4 black guy  Oh I'll kick in the car  Why does color  Have to come into this  Well kick in a car  Oh right  Because they could  Beat up white people  Kick in the BMW  In Philly recently  Because these fucking bitches  Were wearing head to toe furs  I looked  I knew I could take care  Of this crap  Right  So do you size it up  It's hard to say  If violence is happening  Or if you're in protect mode  Like an animal  I don't think you can  I think you just react  Of course  Right right right  Like he did  When he jumped in front  Like there's a problem  And then he saw  Well you confused a lot 
[04:28:30]  Of people though  You made it feel like  You would never really  No  No no no  Whoever was confused by that  I don't know  I think it came across like that  No not at all  It's a feedback  But it sounds like  The only situation  You would step in on  Is if some guy  Completely unprovoked  Came up and hassled your chick  No that's  No no not at all  But I would also be  Very angry at my chick  For not reading the situation  Oh absolutely  And fucking  You have to diffuse the situation  It's almost like  She has a job  In this whole thing as well  You're on the subway  Right  And we've all been on the subway 
[04:29:00]  Now if some maniac  Puts his hands on your woman  Of course you're gonna  Fucking attack him  Yeah that's  Say some crazy motherfucker  Is on the subway  And he's fucking jumping around  And he looks at your girl  And he goes  You fucking ugly bitch  And then walks away  What are you gonna do  Go after him  You know he's a nut  Well he's crazy  He's not shopping at Ikea  I understand the difference  He probably smells like urine  Point I'm making  Is you would size up  That situation  And immediately understand  This is the right move to make  It doesn't mean you're being a faggot  The guy's got a problem  And you know he's got a problem  Yeah but that situation  Is a lot different  Than what Travis was in 
[04:29:30]  Yeah yeah yeah  You're talking a true nut  Right  That's a guy with a problem  And he's not leaving  Thinking he got a fucking  A good piece of you  He's walking away  Thinking he's on fucking Mars  But who knows  What this guy is thinking  And the only reason  I'm saying that  Is because  I don't care who agrees with me  Because the other guy  That jumped in  The guy went right to him  It was like  That's a guy  Who's looking for something  That wasn't a guy  Who went oh shit  And he should've gotten it  There's two men  And he should've fucking gotten it  I think he was a very insecure douche  If he really was gonna do something  He would've punched  He would've done something  Travis he would've pushed Lisa 
[04:30:00]  Of course  He was a fucking pussy  Kick him in the nuts  And bite his cheek off  And he won a battle  Bite his fucking cheek off  He won a battle  That he probably shouldn't've won  In my opinion  Maybe you're right  This is just how I'm seeing it  Because especially with the move  Where you put the keys in your hand  And you got one poking out and stuff  Hack  That's hack shit  That's hack movie shit  Alright so what was the right move  For Travis  Instantly take the motherfucker out  I don't wanna sound like  I'm fucking Mr. Macho  And shit  Cause given the same situation  I don't know what I would've done  Any situation  Is different  You don't know what you're gonna do 
[04:30:30]  Right  But a guy like that  Has to be fucking brought down  To his knees immediately  The second he starts getting in your chick's face  And then turns to you  You instantly punch him in the fucking nose  Instantly fucking punch him in the nose  And he's out of the fucking situation  Got problem solved  You know what Travis should've done  Seriously  Is he should've blown his rape whistle  Alright  You carry it with you  That's true  I didn't think of it 
[04:31:00]  Nathaniel  What's your take on it  You're obviously a very good fighter  He wants to fight  Dan would challenge him  To a Call of Duty 4 match  And kick his ass  I'm not talking about  A fan personally  Who can really take care of himself  I'm like  You're reading Travis  In that situation  What should Travis  Yeah  What should have  What should have  What should Travis have done  I'm having a rough one today man  I agree with  I think violence is the last resort  Alright sensei  Sensei  It's true  Because too much  Even if you 
[04:31:30]  Say you punch the guy  Yeah  You go for the nose  You hit his cheek  Nice  And it glances off his face  And all you've done  Is really upset  And started a fight  With some psycho  You've gained nothing  And lost  You know  Your teeth  Yeah  Alright  Do you go home  Especially with  You know  Travis's build  Look how about a punch  And a kick to the balls  At the same time  And bite his throat  I  You gotta fight  So fucking dirty  You really got  I don't fight clean  No fucking way 
[04:32:00]  None of us have had a fight  In 20 years  None of us have  None of us have  Because we think  You think on a daily  As much rage as you have  Any fight I've ever had  Has been very dirty  Except when Boomer Esiason  Broke my arm  And he was big  But then you just  Fucking took it out  On the jets  A bunch of years later  That was a fight  I should have stayed out of  If I thought there was  No way to get out of violence  I would fight  I would  Balls first  Those are just big targets  Hanging there  Right  Yeah  And then I would  Yeah  And then I would  Absolutely fight  But I don't 
[04:32:30]  I think if you can  Get out of it  Without actually  Getting hit  Or punching somebody  It's better  But I'm not talking  About being a doormat either  And that doesn't make you  Feel shitty  When you leave the situation  Yeah but  Yeah but  I'm an adult  You know you lose  No  You win you lose  Anthony the only reason  I'm disagreeing with you  The only reason  Is because of the way  The situation started  Which was with  I love my girlfriend  Of course I would defend her  Of course I would defend her  Of course I would step in  And punch somebody  If I had to 
[04:33:00]  Of course  But I would be very angry at her  For having that  Fucking delusion of safety  Like that I don't have  You don't have that  Delusion of safety  So that would annoy me  That she  Put the  Perpetuated this situation  As much as  I don't necessarily think  That she  That she did that  Thinking that you know  I was going to be there  Because what she said  Just un-fucking-believable  Was nothing  Yeah un-fucking-believable  Is nothing  I agree  It's nothing  The only time  I was  I was a little upset  Was when she said 
[04:33:30]  You know  Happy Chinese New Year  Because that  You know  As funny as it is  Very funny by the way  It's very funny  I thought it was really  Just going to send  The situation over the top  By the way Lisa  That still bothers that guy  Oh yeah  So you did get  Because that was  Below the belt  It couldn't have just been  Two human beings  It had to  You had to bring race into it  Wonderful move  By the way  Wonderful move  Another Travis online  From Iowa  Travis from Iowa  What's up  Yeah I think you both are right  But I think what Jimmy's  Trying to say is 
[04:34:00]  What Lisa  I can't remember her name  Would have said that  If Travis wouldn't have been there  That's what Jimmy's trying to say  No no I'm not  No no no  I'm actually  I think she probably would have  No no no  I think you're misinterpreting me  A little bit  I don't think that Lisa  Was wanting Travis  When I say the veil of safety  I don't think she was  Using Travis as that  But I'm saying in the same sense  That that guy was  Shit talking Kenny  Like what are you doing  In the real world  Like this is not a film  This is a real situation  And you're not reading it right  That's what  Of course  You have to defend 
[04:34:30]  But of course you do  But that's what would  Drive me crazy  Like when my girlfriend  Does shit  Like she doesn't  She's never argued with people  But she's very funny  And we're like  Like you know  We're walking one time  And this guy walked up  A little behind us  Just you know  Passing us  And she went  Like she was scared  And I laughed  But I'm like  Don't fucking engage people  In the fucking streets  Stupid  It's really annoying  Because you don't  Oh yeah  That's a weird situation  Even though your motives  Aren't bad  Do not  I don't mean be a coward  And fucking  I'm a dick  Like if I have a fucking 
[04:35:00]  Argument with a heckler  I honest to god  Will stand outside the door  At the cellar  I don't want to fight the guy  But I'm not going to be cowed  Like I'm not going to run upstairs  So I will literally  Stand outside the fucking clubs  For like five minutes  And say well  If the guy wants to come out  And say anything  I'm here  And that's only so  I can go home at night  And know that I didn't get  Heckled and run away  Yeah  So it's like  It's a stupid thing  But I have the same  Fucking ego  As another man does  I've spelt it out  To my girlfriend too  I've spelt it out  Don't fucking cause problems  Out on the street  With anybody  Like don't 
[04:35:30]  Don't ever put me  In a situation  Where I have to start  Swinging  Because of something  You said  I've spelt it out  I've got to jump in  But I've got to get going  All right  All right  Have a good day boy  Go start trouble  Somewhere else  Goodbye you Canadian racists  You troublemaker  Canadian racists  Canadian racists  And I do love Lisa  They're working at that  Sweatshop  MyradioStore.com  Yep  I like her balls  I like the fact  She's balls  Is it a sweatshop 
[04:36:00]  Oh I don't know  It's a big warehouse  They're a bunch of drunks  Are what they are  Fucking  Work two hours  And then it's happy hour  The rest of the day  Jesus Christ  How does anything  Get done there  With a guy named  Ziggy running the joint  Ziggy and his  Stupid marijuana  Oh  Enough  I've seen Ziggy  Laying on the floor  In bars  Just in a bar  Under a pool table  On the floor  And he's the boss  By the way  I threw some marijuana away  Did you?  By accident though  Because I was still debating  If I was going to 
[04:36:30]  Start smoking again  Nah you can't get into  That shit  And I  I appreciate  The fine gesture  Someone did for me  But it ended up  In a  I got a Christmas card  And I was hiding it  From  From my designer  And a cleaning woman  And it was in the bag  That the Christmas card  Came in  Oops  And then I was cleaning up  And I  I might have thrown away  Some fine bud  Threw in the bud  So someone's going to be  Really pissed at me  Oh  Anyway 
[04:37:00]  Mike  De  De  De  De  De  De  De  De  De  It's my congestion  You're not as itchy  No that's all it is  You got some stories on this  You've been listening  For the last half hour  Oh he was outside  Fucking going  Yeah Anthony  I was cheering for you  But then Jim's right too  Everybody's kind of right  But  You should have  You gotta  You gotta  Like what you're saying  That it's fucking  So important  You can't leave somewhere  Feeling like  Like 
[04:37:30]  You let somebody  Abuse you  It'll eat away at you  I've been in that situation  In the past  I've been in both sides  Of that situation  Where I've left a situation  After talking things out  And felt like a fucking idiot  For doing it  Yeah  And just regretting  Not punching the guy  In the face  Yeah  And then I've  I've punched a guy  And felt great about it  Well what you do is  And go good  The guy deserved it  You work with levels  You know what I mean  If I bump into you  I say I'm sorry  And you say go fuck your mother  I don't hit you  I say  What's the matter 
[04:38:00]  What are you retalking  Asshole  Yeah whatever  And then you push it  To a certain point  And then you escalate it  You know  But the women  Listen  They fucking start shit  I'm not saying  Oh yeah yeah  I will not deny that  We're all on the same page there  My ex was like  If somebody would have hit her  I would have fucked them up  But I would have counted  To three first  I would have gave them  Three seconds  To fucking hit her  Because she deserved it  Like you're that kind of scenario  Yeah  I've looked at guys  And go I know dude  I'm sorry  Like I've apologized  Like to waiters 
[04:38:30]  Because she was such a cunt to them  And you can see  They want to fucking choke her  And you almost want to say  Look I'm only dating her  A few months  Punch her once in the throat  When I go to the bathroom  Something  Because you really get  You know women  Every  Not every fight  I was arrested in Florida  Listen to this  Right before my honeymoon  Right before my wedding  I was  We lived in Florida  We were gonna  We got married in New York  Our wedding was in New York  And we bought these tickets  On this cheap airline  I think it was Airbus  Or some shit  This is a long time ago  And we get to the airport 
[04:39:00]  And this little fuck  Behind the counter  Is like just going really slow  And we're running late  For our flight  Long story short  I start arguing with the guy  Like can you hurry up  I'm the second  Behind a woman  And he's just going  So I said  Dude we're gonna be late  For our flight  And he's like  Just wait a minute  Like with his hand  I said  Dude please  Help us out  My wife  Says to me  Honey don't  Don't  Push his buttons  They'll fuck up our luggage  Like just  And I just imagined 
[04:39:30]  That he said it  I dove over the counter  You gotta see me  I was holding the guy's neck  My wife's pulling my legs  The cops can't get arrested  I had to put my wedding off  A week  Because I got arrested  So that wasn't a good  Thing to do  No  But sometimes  Like Jimmy said  As comics man  People  You know  Cause you wanna  Battle them with your wits  And Jimmy  More than me actually  Can fuck somebody up  Mentally  I'm not as good  I get right to  They heckle boo 
[04:40:00]  And I go  Hey don't heckle me man  That's not right  And then they say  Well you suck  And I say  How about if I  Kick you to death  Or something  You know what I mean  I go right to that  And then  Jim will take like  20 minutes  And rip them apart  Verbally  Deconstruct somebody  Exactly  They're left  Like psychologically  Traumatized  Damaged forever  Right  They go out in the parking lot  And off themselves  They're like that  You know  But then you have guys  That threaten you  I'm sure  Big fucking  Lunk heads  And you just gotta  Look at them  And dude  I know you're a little guy  And all that 
[04:40:30]  But you would've felt  So much better  If you would've  Like told that guy  To go fuck his mother  Or something  And even if you get a beating  Sometimes  It's good  Cause sometimes  You need a little beating  In life  Yeah  As long as you  Told him to fuck his mother  That's kind of what you remember  But you could get killed too  There's people  That's what I'm saying  It's crazy  It's not just a punch in the face  Or like  The consequences are  You're gonna have a black guy tomorrow  Cause we all look at that  Like yeah  I could take a black guy  Or even a fucking ass kicking  But it's not about that  It's not about  Oh he might sock me  It's about  What if he pulls out something  And slashes my face 
[04:41:00]  Or it's like  You have to think that way  When you sense  That somebody is a fucking problem  And I'm believing Travis  When he says  He senses the guy  Was a fucking problem  He's not saying  Like a guy like Mike  Is a guy who's just  A fucking aggressive dude  But he's not a fucking  He's not an insane  Do you understand what I mean  Like a guy like Mike  Is gonna punch you in the face  But you don't have to worry  Like is this gonna have a pistol on him  I mean this  You really have to think  That shit in this world  It's fucking stupid not to  I look like I have both going right  Yeah I mean I can see you doing  Of course  No no but yeah 
[04:41:30]  And if people disagree by the way  Put him through  No no fuck that  You know bullies like  Like you know  Like you were saying  Something about bullies  Like you gotta be a real like  Punk to be a bully really  Yep  Do you know what I'm saying  Like I would never  Like a guy  Especially smaller guys  I never like get aggressive  With smaller guys  Like you just feel  Like a piece of shit  But most people  Don't have like  They don't  They're not guiding themselves  Through life  Based on their moral  Fucking fiber  They just do whatever  The fuck they feel  That's what I can't 
[04:42:00]  Fucking stand  When this guy pulls up  And thinks he's entitled  And he's somehow  His time is more fucking important  Than mine  Then that pisses me off  To no end  And I won't listen  To any argument  Over why he should be  Ahead of me  Or something  I'll see people walk up  You ever see the  Subtle walk up  And try to cut right  In front of you  Move  And people just stand there  They don't say anything  I go  Excuse me  I've been standing on line  Oh I just have 
[04:42:30]  These two things  Well when you get  Up to the counter  It'll be fast then  I go watch how quick I am  And I'll go  I'll get my shit  And I'll leave  Two seconds  I'm done  Everyone that's in front of me  Ten fucking minutes  They can't figure shit out  This guy wasn't big though  He was a small dude  No he was  Probably a little bigger  Than anything  He wasn't like  He was a big  Well that means  He was a giant to you  Travis  That's true  Everyone is  Everyone's big to Travis  A guy yelling  Like that  To me does not  Constitute a bully  Because he's just a dick 
[04:43:00]  Or a maniac  There's a difference  Between  What about the sense  Of fucking entitlement  That this asshole has  I don't know enough  About that system  Like  If you're pulling up  And your stuff's ready  And you have your car  And someone is saving a spot  That would annoy me  If someone was saving a spot  They don't even have their car there  And I'm just grabbing something  It's like  Well why would you  Why would I wait for you  To load a truck  When I have my car here  Like I don't know  What the system in Ikea is  To be honest with you  I'm not  Because I've also never  I'm sure it's stupid  Oh it's  But it's almost like  If he had his van  And his stuff was ready  Um 
[04:43:30]  Why are you saving a spot  When like  You have to go get your car  I don't know  Maybe their shit was  I don't know how that works  Readier  And people  Everyone grows up  In a different like environment  You know  My cousin's here today  My little cousin  We had a grandmother  Our grandmother  Would tell us  If somebody  Makes fun of you  You hit them with something  Like a bat  Or a pipe  This is my grandmother  I'm not kidding you  We were taught this as kids  So you grow up  And that's what you think  You see that  You see that happening  I'm like 
[04:44:00]  For somebody that's like  A tough guy  Street guy  I'm very respectful of people  Because I'm afraid to  Like I don't know you  I'm nice to you  Until  Like if it gets down  But I don't know you  And I know guys  That are smaller than him  That have 40 or 50 bodies  Under their belt  Like I grew up  In that kind of environment  So  Like if you cut someone off  In my neighborhood  You don't really  Give them the finger  Especially if it's a woman  It could be a wise guy's  Fucking sister  Or daughter  Like you just  I grew up like that  Like being careful 
[04:44:30]  Of what you say  And what you do  And a lot of people  Don't have that  And Jim's point  About that  That safety thing  Like we're in a bank  And you know  You know  They can't hit  He won't hit me here  But you know  So they can say  Fuck you  You fucking piece of shit  And then someone  Will just crack you  And you're like  Oh fuck  I read that one wrong  And I don't mean  Letting people shit on you  I don't mean that  I mean like  Just starting an aggressive situation  When you don't have to  Because you're not reading  What the guy really is  I'm not talking about  If a guy walks up 
[04:45:00]  And motherfucks your girl  You're supposed to go  Well he's a little kooky  I don't mean that  Well I understand that  That's a given  That's 100%  You probably won't find  Any guy  That if a guy comes up  And starts motherfucking  Your girl  Isn't gonna step in  And punch him in the face  But then there are levels  Of motherfucking your girl  You know  Where  Where the guy still deserves  A punch in the fucking face  And some people's level  Is higher than others  I don't like the idea  Of someone  Getting away with something 
[04:45:30]  Getting one over  On me  We gotta clear this up  And that annoys  The piss out of me  Get a little older  You'll fucking eat at ya  We gotta clear this up too  We don't hang out  In tough neighborhoods  No  So it makes it a little easier  I gotta be honest with you  To get into some of these  If you're not dealing  With that kind of stuff  Like Mike's neighborhood  I'm a fucking boy scout  Trust me  Yeah it's crazy  I'm a boy scout  It really is  And it's not about  Like who I'm tough  Or any of this  But in some of these neighborhoods  Out there in Long Island  I'll pop any fucking  Accountant or rabbi  In my neighborhood 
[04:46:00]  You're the gangster  Come on  Bring him on  Last night  Who'd I say  At the cellar  Oh Frank Smiley  Came out to watch me  And I invited him  To go to Rayo's  For dinner  And he's like  You could go to Rayo's  I go yeah  I can go to Rayo's  When are we getting  The big invite  Whenever you want  It's a restaurant  Up in Harlem  It's a tough place  To get into  Yeah it's like  You gotta know  Wise guys  And stuff like that  I grew up  There was a little  Shooting there  Last year  Two years ago  I grew up  My uncle  Got friends there  That don't mean  Nothing about who I am  It's cool to be able  To go there and eat 
[04:46:30]  So I invited Frank Smiley  The guy from Conan  And he started like  Whoa  I don't want to  Not put you on the show  And he's like  Doing that whole  Sopranos thing  And it became  A little annoying  Like treating me like  You know  Like oh you're Italian  It was just weird  Fucking thing  Are you going to be  On the show?  Yeah Friday  Yeah we're calling for you  Oh nice  That's why Mikey's in  Calling on Friday?  No he said I was in  Just to hang out  Beautiful  Not really  Oh really?  You were in recently 
[04:47:00]  Beautiful  We like to like  Spread these things out  Spread it out  Alright  Calling on Friday night  Mike's a funny comic man  Absolutely  He's been killing on our show  Not the first appearance  You were shy  Because I didn't say nothing  Yeah the last two  You've been great though  It was fun  Calling on Friday right?  Yeah calling on Friday night  Make sure we get that out there  We have to take a break  So are we going to agree  To disagree or are we going to  I don't even think we disagree  That much to be honest with you  Yeah we're very close on this  But it's just the level  Of intensity  Yeah  And how we would react to it  Everybody's saying 
[04:47:30]  The right thing  Everyone has  Everyone has their line  It's going to happen  You're going to make that decision  When the time comes  You know  I'm more like Anthony  I lean more towards him  Where I almost  And it sounds fucking nuts  But I almost  It's like  At that moment  I'd rather die  Than walk away  Feeling like a pussy  And I know that sounds nuts  But  No worse feeling  Hey this is Big Kev  And you're listening to  The worst  Of Opie and Anthony  It's the worst  Danny you really need to drink more 
[04:48:00]  Of Opie and Anthony  Sherry Shepard from The View  Sherry Shepard  I see her a lot  Oh yeah  Yeah we've said hi a few times  Really  Like hey what's up  She's like alright  You're talking Jimmy  You live in the same  Same place as her  Yeah  Close  What are some of the things  She has said on The View  She thinks the earth is flat  Yeah  She also thinks  That the earth  Is only what  She's one of those  It's only a couple thousand years  She's a fundamentalist 
[04:48:30]  Fundamentalist  10,000 years  Is that now old  What was the big one  Where she  It was something about  Dinosaurs and Jesus  Walked the earth  At the same time  Of course they did  Yeah  And the dinosaur said  Why when I was in the tar pit  Did I just see  One set of my  Big dinosaur footprints  Why did you abandon me Jesus  And Jesus said  Because you're too heavy  You big stupid dinosaur  Exactly  And of course Pete Rain  You got fat ankles  And eventually we're gonna need  Gas  Yes  So you  I tried holding your hand 
[04:49:00]  But your arms are so little  I didn't come  In your image  Yeah  Because you bit me  Remember  Dummy  You were eating leaves  I left you  I was trying to be holy  But we don't speak  The same language  I'm like oh yeah  They're still apes  I'll come back  I'll come back later  When they're cooked  Jesus  Well listen to what  She's up to now  This is a good one  All righty  Sherry Shepard opens up  About her sad history  Shocking revelations  From The View co-host 
[04:49:30]  She's enjoying The View now  But not too long ago  Life was pretty rough  For Sherry Shepard  I was in a very  Physically abusive relationship  I was sleeping  With a lot of guys  And had more abortions  Than I would like to count  Nice  Sherry Shepard  Told Precious Times Magazine  Her life changed  When she converted  From being a Jehovah's Witness  To Christianity  Sherry says  In the 1990s  Her family life  Was a mess  Quote  My mother was dying  From diabetic complications  My sister was heavy  Into drugs  And we would have to go 
[04:50:00]  And get her  From crack houses  Sherry says  God made the difference  In her life  I'm terrific  These days  Sherry says  She's proud  To be a role model  For women  I love this chick  Is she a role model?  Really?  No she's not  She said the world  Is flat  She didn't know  The world was round  She's always on her back  That's all she knows  This chick rules  She's banging  She gets rid of them  And she gets hit  Punch  More abortions  Than she can count  Wow  Three  Oh 
[04:50:30]  Wow  What a wild  Wild  Woman  Well  We can play  The old clip  This is great  Yeah let's play that  First one  I gotta hear it  This is a little montage  Of Sherry Shepard  Dumb things  Keep in mind  That probably  When he was around  There was no  Jesus Christ  Stuff going on  No no they still had  Christians back then 
[04:51:00]  I don't want to be  Sick there  I mean they had their  Gods  The Greeks  The Greeks believed  They had Christians  And they had  I'm doing  They outshot them  They had Christians  And they threw them  To the lions  I think this might  Predate that  I think this might  Predate that  I don't think anything  Predated Christians  No no no  The Greeks came first  Then the Romans  Then the Christians  Jesus came first  Before them  So I  Okay  Alright  It doesn't matter 
[04:51:30]  Anyway  They didn't believe  In Jesus  They believed  In polytheism  Many gods  Oh my god  She is  A dummy  She's as dumb  As they come  She's Voss  If he was a black woman  A dummy  I was thinking  The same thing  That's Voss's credits  A bunch of abortions  No  And by those  You mean career missteps  That's like a history  Discussion  With only an understanding  Of People magazine  They really are 
[04:52:00]  She is a  Joy  Joy Beha  I actually love  She's great on the show  Yeah  She's very informed  Joy  And she's not self-righteous  Yeah  She's not a baby  Yeah  She can handle herself  In a discussion  This one though  She  Sherry Shepard  Is a dope  No no no  There wasn't anything  Before Jesus  Really  Really  Then what sin  Did he come to forgive  Stupid  The world was in trouble  Why did he show up 
[04:52:30]  In the beginning  Things are great  Here I am  Who are you  And why do we need you  I'm here to die  For your sins  No one's done anything  Wrong yet J.C.  God almighty  Is she an idiot  Sodom and Gomorrah  All those things  That were happening  The big flood  All the fun  Yeah  God what a goose  Yeah it's adorable though  Here's another one  From Sherry Shepard  Is the world flat  Is the world flat  Yes  I don't know  What do you think  I never thought about it  Whoopi  Is the world flat 
[04:53:00]  I never thought about it  You never thought about  Whether the world was wrong  No because  But I'll tell you  What I thought about  How I'm going to feed my child  Oh shut  My family  The world  Is the world flat  Has never entered into  That has not been  An important thing  What about the dead ones  If my son Jeffrey  Asked me if the world flat  I guess I will go  And  Didn't Columbus  Already work this question out  I mean why  Are we going to  What did she say  Didn't Columbus  Already work this question out  Yeah yeah  I like the fact  She's like  I gotta feed my family  It's like  They're mutually exclusive 
[04:53:30]  You can only think of one  Do you think the world is round  My baby's hungry  Mommy I'm hungry  Oh boy  I guess I'm not going to be able  To find out that whole world thing  It's always when people  Have big drinking problems  And serious life issues  That they turn to God  And then they become the president  And I always respect people  Who don't turn to God  In those situations  I've had hard  I mean I know  You've had issues  You didn't go to  Evolution doesn't exist 
[04:54:00]  Theories  He just went to a girl  With a deep voice  Hi daddy  I'll take all your problems away  A different kind of evolution  From male to female  Hi Cro-Magnon daddy  Yeah I don't get it  Why when you  Hit the skids  As they say  You have to then  Sacrifice any common sense  When it comes to science  Any logic whatsoever  And logic and reason  And adapt this whole  Or adopt this whole 
[04:54:30]  Thinking that  You know religion  That's great  If that gets you out of  Whatever crap  You got yourself into in life  That's fine  But why should you then  Sacrifice the ability  To know if the world  Is flat or round  That is a common thing  That has been known  For centuries  By the smallest  Dumbest little  Retarded child  But why would she answer that  In that way you think 
[04:55:00]  Does she have an agenda  Because she's stupid  Just because she's stupid  She's stupid  She honestly didn't know  If the world was flat or round  She just doesn't know  She's trying to be different too  And trying to say  Because she's seen globes  She's just trying to say  Like hey who knows  What  You know like people  That are just trying to be interesting  Is that just a round  Flat map though  To make it easy  And spin  Pretty  What about the globe  Or have you ever seen  One of those globe type maps  That are like a globe 
[04:55:30]  That's been flattened out  Yeah you try to be different  You get a tattoo or something  You don't act stupid  And say the world's flat  But I can understand  When you know  Columbus was living  But now we got pictures  From space  And space shuttles  And where's the rest  Of the flatness going  The movie Contact  You dummy  Yeah I mean  Every  The movie Contact  That was a good movie  Wasn't it  Yeah I love that  Yeah I like that one  It was pretty cool  Astronomer Carl Sagan  With billions  And billions  And billions  He's dead  And very badly raped 
[04:56:00]  You see  We got someone actually  Sticking up for the Jesus thing  Oh  There we go  I love these  Pennsylvania  Jesus fan number one  Hello  You're on the air  Hi Tim  Let's respect Tim's ideology  Hi guys  Listen  I'm a born again Christian  And I just want to clarify  Christians believe  You know  In the Trinity  And the Trinity states that  The Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit  Are co-equals  Therefore Jesus is God  Therefore Jesus existed before  He was born of Mary 
[04:56:30]  You know  Okay  You got it?  Yeah that makes  You got it?  As long as she's not talking about  Like okay Christ showed up  Like when Christ showed up  You're talking about it  In the sense of the Trinity  That makes sense  Sir I don't want to  I don't think she's saying it in that way  Maybe not  I really don't  And I don't want to criticize  Jesus  I've always thought that  Jesus is a good role model  But he's kind of like  The popular guy  Where everyone says  They're his friend  But he wouldn't name you  As one of his best friends  Like if you asked him  Who his best friends were 
[04:57:00]  He'd be like  Gandhi  Martin Luther King Jr  Matt Damon  And you'd be like  What about Mike Perbiglia?  He'd be like  I feel like I'd recognize his face  If I saw him  But the name doesn't ring a bell  And he wouldn't say  Martin Luther King  That womanizer  No sir  That's such an odd thing  So he's saying like  In a spiritual sense  That Jesus was there  The whole time  Even before  The Holy Spirit  Was always there  I suppose  Yeah  The Holy Ghost  That's not what she's getting at  No no no  She's just stupid 
[04:57:30]  Right  Is pretty much  All right  I think though  Looking at the Trinity  I think Trinity and Neo  Made a great pair  And it made three  Three pretty good movies  I thought not so good  Trinity was good  I believe in Tank  Yeah  Yeah  The big black guy  Is that Tank?  Oh yeah  Tank ruled  Yeah  I also like the guy  That was in that  Yeah but you know  We have to look to the Oracle 
[04:58:00]  To find out if Neo is  In fact the one  And until I find that out  I think that guy  From Pennsylvania  That doesn't really know  About Trinity  You're talking about  Different things  He's talking about  Real God  And you're talking  About a movie  Literal Jim  Everyone  Literal Jim  Is made an appearance  To destroy the bit  No I love literal Jim  Literal Jim's a bit like  Literal Jim  Is a big foot  In the middle of fun  Steps on everything 
[04:58:30]  You say  You say too much  That you love literal Jim  That means you hate  Literal Jim  I cannot stand  Literal Jim  You hate LJ  LJ sucks  It's a little unfair  Because literal Jim  Is selectively literal  Yeah  Yes  He just comes in  Whenever he chooses  And just takes it literally  Yeah  And then you're stuck  With no defense  And you just gotta go  Okay  Good point Jim  Good point literal Jim  L of the J  Steps in whenever he wants  I guess you don't like comedy  Sounds good  Literal Jim just likes it accurate 
[04:59:00]  Likes to get the facts out there  That's the point  This is the Rat Bastard  Steven Piercy  That's right  I'm the guy who took you  Round and round  Remember that  You're listening to the worst  The worst  Absolute crap  On Opie and Anthony  They're such sweethearts  Opie and Anthony </pre>
