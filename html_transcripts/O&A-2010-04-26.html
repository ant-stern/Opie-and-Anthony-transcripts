<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie detailing his severe allergies and the exorbitant cost of his eye drops, sparking a discussion about prescription drug prices.  This segued into a humorous anecdote about his wife Bonnie's expensive morning sickness medication despite not being pregnant.  The conversation then shifted to the comedic difficulties Opie and Kenny faced applying eye drops, involving detailed, physical demonstrations of their struggles. Opie further recounted spilling coffee in Kenny's pristine car and finding Imodium in his glove compartment.  The UFC fight between Urijah Faber and Jose Aldo became a topic, with Opie expressing his frustration with Time Warner Cable's pay-per-view service. He shared a particularly exasperated phone call with their customer service.  Rich Voss joined the show, sharing his own negative customer service experiences with Oxford Health Insurance.  They discussed Voss's upcoming comedy gigs, noting the surprisingly low price difference between regular and "special event" tickets. The conversation touched on Boston's culinary scene, particularly lobster rolls, and the challenges Opie faced recording the WEC fight due to Time Warner Cable issues. Voss's planned tech gadget segment, initially conceived as a quiz with an electric dog collar punishment, was ultimately scrapped.  The show concluded with further banter about Faber's injured leg, Voss's Boston appearance, potential radio interviews, and the recurring mispronunciation of "Fios."

The next segment began with a discussion about the oldest bars in America, prompted by Opie's visit to Bell in Hand in Boston.  They researched several contenders, ultimately deciding the White Horse Tavern (1671) in Newport, Rhode Island, was the oldest. This transitioned into banter about Opie's appearance and penis size.  A listener then called about her husband being kicked out of a massage parlor for getting an erection, leading to a highly suggestive and sexually explicit conversation about the incident and the caller's swinging lifestyle.  The hosts then discussed Bret Michaels' critical condition after a brain hemorrhage. The bulk of the segment, however, focused on the Opie and Anthony Show's exclusion from a *Celebrity Apprentice* segment.  Anthony, in particular, expressed extreme anger towards SiriusXM staff, whom they called "babysitters," and their legal team, blaming them for a three-week contract processing delay that cost them significant free promotion. Rich Voss and Jimmy were present in the studio throughout this segment.

The following segment centered on the disastrous "Cherry Darts" contest sponsored by Steven Singer Jewelers, which failed due to a malfunctioning email address. Opie unleashed a torrent of highly offensive language ("fucking," "cunts," "dickheads") criticizing the show's IT department and staff for their perceived incompetence. He mentioned considering contacting higher-ups at SiriusXM, Mel and Scott.  He also reflected on his long radio career and disappointment with working with what he considered amateurs. Rich Voss was again in the studio. This segment also included discussions of Opie's therapist (who considers him a genius), Voss's Boston show and Jim Norton's Pittsburgh show, a news story about a homeless man stabbed after saving a woman from a mugging, personal anecdotes (rats, bats, an alligator on a golf course), a caller's Revolutionary War trivia attempt, a detailed account of the *Celebrity Apprentice* contract issue by Sam (likely staff), and a discussion about "Mole People" living in the New York City subway system. The segment ended with continued frustration over the botched contest and the bystander apathy in the mugging incident.

The next segment opened with a discussion of a bat delay during a Kings-Spurs NBA game and LeBron James potentially leaving Cleveland.  Lydia called in recounting her Brooklyn dating experiences, which included smashing rats with baseball bats. Opie shared a bizarre date story involving a sex club and rat viewing.  Dan then called to describe a bear breaking into his car and eating his Dunkin' Donuts.  The conversation moved to bear encounters and camping experiences. Mason recounted a "rat-killing" scheme in a landfill.  The discussion then turned to negative experiences with Chinese restaurants, featuring callers sharing stories of unsanitary conditions and questionable food handling practices. A caller, Charlie (a Costco employee), confirmed that Costco seafood packaging includes country-of-origin information.  Charlie's unusually shaped ears were also discussed. Jason detailed a Chinese restaurant in Hamburg, New York, that was caught butchering a deer in the kitchen and surprisingly had its license reinstated. The segment concluded with Rich Voss sharing his top five tech gadgets, a continued discussion (and misinformation) about Lucille Ball's death, and a recap of Voss's previously broken elbow.

The final segment focused on Rich Voss's favorite tech gadgets: external hard drives (with humorous mispronunciation), a golf GPS device (Sky Caddy), and a car GPS (Garmin). He discussed their functionality and frustrations with subscription fees and battery life.  The conversation shifted to a comparison of iPhone GPS apps versus dedicated devices.  They then debated the appropriateness of public scrutiny of celebrities' personal lives versus their professional conduct, using Alec Baldwin and Tiger Woods as examples.  The discussion returned to Voss's tech gadgets, concluding with his TiVo and potential Mac conversion.  The segment ended with a discussion about backing up iPhones, with some confusion about iTunes capabilities. Travis was called in for his expertise on iPhone apps.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enraging, right?  It really is.  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Enraging is what I hold in my hand.  The allergies this season here in the New York area, really, really bad.  You get allergies, Rich Voss?  Yes, I do.  You do?  You're an allergy guy.  I'm allergic to Arabs. 
[00:00:30]  I used to be.  I wasn't that bad for this early.  It wasn't that bad at all.  It's not bad at all.  No, sometimes I don't.  He's chuckling.  Don't you want more than someone chuckling?  No, it's neutral.  Chuckling gets you in the Hall of Fame.  Chuckling's good?  Okay.  I had him for a while.  So far, everybody's complaining so bad, but it's not fucking with my eyes or nose.  There's some kind of, like, super pollen that hit because it warmed up too fast or something.  Maybe we can get, I don't know, a scientist or somebody to explain it.  But, um, so I'm getting really bad itchy eyes to the point where it's driving me nuts, right? 
[00:01:00]  So I ran into myologist at a Jewish restaurant yesterday afternoon, a kosher place.  It just happens to be in the neighborhood.  I don't really like Jewish food, but they had other choices.  And he was there.  So he calls in a prescription.  He goes, I can take care of your itchy eye problem.  And I go to CVS, and I called in a prescription for pat a day or something like that.  It's a little eye drop thing.  I go there, after my insurance, it's $25, right? 
[00:01:30]  Look at how small this is.  They want you to put one drop per eye per day.  There might be 20 drops in this thing.  And I wasted two this morning trying to fucking get them in my eyes.  What is it for?  It's the allergic eyes.  I guess it's a, you know.  It's like a fucking supervising.  Yeah, exactly.  It better be a supervising.  Look how tiny this is.  For fucking, does someone have a regular visine on them? 
[00:02:00]  I'm going to have to tweet this.  Well, you know, they talk about fucking health care and health care reform.  Why don't they talk about drug company reform?  Bonnie, when, now, did, did, uh, yes, get morning sickness pills?  Morning sickness?  Lindsay.  Oh, no.  Okay.  She's, uh, she's, uh, yeah, she's done all right with all that, thank God.  She didn't have morning sickness?  No.  Bonnie had it, and she wasn't even pregnant, just looking at me.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:02:30]  When she got up, that's, that's worth a chuckle.  So, we want more than chuckles here.  The morning sickness pill we got from the insurance company, uh, was still a hundred bucks after insurance.  It would have been 700 if you didn't have insurance.  Yeah, exactly.  It's for cancer patients, basically.  So, the drug companies are like, cancer patients don't have insurance?  Fuck them.  They got to pay 700 for like 12 bills.  It would be easier to be a heroin addict.  Yeah.  Than fucking deal with, with these prescriptions. 
[00:03:00]  $700 if you didn't have insurance.  Yes.  For morning sickness pills.  Yeah, well, they're for, technically for cancer pills.  Yeah, but you should let her just puke.  Huh?  You should just let her puke in the morning.  Yeah, but not.  I'm serious.  I, I don't know.  If you didn't have insurance, especially.  That's true.  Yeah, I'd let them puke.  Yeah, it's ridiculous what we, what we spend for, you know, our, our drugs that we need  to survive.  When, when like, if I go to get a drug or something, like say I was getting stomach medicine, and 
[00:03:30]  but, and say it was for four times, I could get a jar of it or whatever.  And say my stomach was better after one jar, I would still get the other three and load  up on them.  Right.  I'd get as much shit as I, because you never know if we get attacked and all of a sudden  you're fucking stuck in your house forever.  Right.  And then you had the medicine.  What do you say?  What I'm saying is get as much medicine as you can.  As you can now?  Yes.  Well, so I, I wasted a couple drops already and, uh, look at, look at this.  It's like, it's a third of the size of a regular Visine. 
[00:04:00]  This thing is tiny.  How, $25 for this after?  After insurance?  It would have cost at least a hundred.  If you didn't have a show of commission, a hundred.  So I, I asked Kenny this morning, I go, Kenny, you're going to have, I go, these drops are  so valuable and I got really itchy eyes.  You're going to have to put the drops in my eyes.  Where's Kenny?  Cause Jimmy, did you know that he can't put drops in his own eyes?  No, but it doesn't surprise me.  He's a little deep set Doberman pincher eyes.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Uh, look, he's walking down the hall smiling.  I go, Kenny, I know we got to discuss this.  This might be a little gay, but these drops are valuable and I got to make sure they get  in my eye.  I think you might have to do this.  I, I go, I'll hold the, I'll hold my eyelids open and everything.  All I have to do is get that damn drop in my eyes.  And what'd you say, Kenny?  You don't do drops, right?  I'm not a doctor.  You're not a doctor.  Yeah.  But then you, then you, uh, you, you shared with me that your wife has to put the drops  in your eyes because, because why?  I can't do it. 
[00:05:00]  Why?  To do it in Norton's eyes, you got to shoot it through a hole.  You don't.  Jim does his own eye drops.  Thank you, Kenny.  Really?  And you can't do a Karenish pillow.  No, I got, I got to lie down with my eyes closed.  This is the truth.  And then my wife will put the drops in and I just blink rapidly.  But she doesn't put the drops in because he has to keep his eyes shut.  Why?  So she puts it on, she puts it on the eye lid that's closed and then he quickly opens 
[00:05:30]  and closes hoping that it slides into his eye.  I just, I could never do elastic surgery having that like knife come like right at your eye  when you're awake.  Well, you know, you grow up, you try, all you do is this.  These are my, these are just my, my moisture drops.  You have to hold it a little bit above your eye.  Now I'm just, I take my left hand and I hold my fingers open and I put my, my thumb kind  of, look, I balanced the, I balanced a little bit of the little eye drop thing. 
[00:06:00]  My, my left thumb and my left pointer finger hold open my left eye.  Right.  I take the little, uh, dropper.  I balance it on my thumb so it doesn't touch my eye.  Right.  And then I have my other, my right thumb on my nose.  So the whole thing is like a fucking, a balancing works.  And then you fucking, he's doing it.  You're fucking eye drops.  You guys are making, well, really?  Give me the visine.  I haven't done it in my, probably in my life.  There.  No.  Very easy to do.  I hope you get pink eye.  Here you go.  Hey. 
[00:06:30]  That's Butch's.  Well then, I don't know.  Exactly.  I don't know where he's been.  No offense, Butch.  Yeah, you can.  So, so Kenny wouldn't do it.  So, so my first attempt, I hit my cheek.  Mars goes, you missed.  I'm like, I know I missed.  I felt the wetness hit my cheek.  Thanks, Mars.  Did I, I was going to man up when nobody was looking.  I know.  So Kenny goes, all right, I guess I could try.  Dude, you can do it.  You just got to.  I finally got it done, but I wasted half my drops.  The drops don't hurt.  There's no drops in here.  They don't hurt.  I'm not worried about the drops hurting. 
[00:07:00]  I want to get the drops in my eye.  I don't like Kenny blinking it in like a dog.  Right.  It's not.  That's what I do.  It's fucking ridiculous.  I go, you're a monster.  You can't handle, you know, getting eye drops right into your eyeballs.  He doesn't mind a fist coming at his eye.  Right.  Exactly.  Maybe that's how you should do it.  Get someone to put it on their knuckles.  Fucking punch it.  Fucking brute.  When you get laser surgery, they have to put a knife to your eye.  Don't they?  Well, it's a blade.  It's a blade, but I had it done.  It's creepy.  Because Kenny's talking about that. 
[00:07:30]  Most people don't want to go through LASIK surgery.  Because they lift up the flap, and then all of a sudden you barely see for the few minutes that they're working on that eye.  I thought it was done with a laser.  It is.  It is.  But there's still a blade that comes down.  It's all computer.  They have to cut the cornea, and then they lift the cornea to get in there with the laser.  Did you have that done?  Yeah, both of us.  I had it done.  It needs a little touch-up at this point, but I'm being 41.  I don't know if I want to go back, because my left eye had damage at one point.  You think that's the only thing that needs touch-up? 
[00:08:00]  Jesus Christ.  Having a chin-in plan, that wouldn't hurt.  It's all my chin.  Well, B.J. Penn pointed out to everybody that he had a tough time putting you in an arm bar,  because he couldn't find your chin.  Oh, jeez.  Did you see that video, Rich?  No.  I couldn't find my chin.  B.J. Penn put him in an arm bar.  That's why he didn't play football.  The helmet kept falling off.  But after the show, he admitted he had a tough time, because he couldn't find his chin. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  His leg didn't know what to do.  So then I spilled a little coffee in Kenny's car.  I go, oh, Kenny.  And he freaks out, because he's an OCD.  His car looks brand new, even though it's a year or so old now.  So he opens up the glove compartment, and I find his Imodium.  He's got Imodium in the glove compartment.  Imodium A.D.?  A.D., yeah.  What's that for, Kenny?  In case I've got to pucker up my asshole.  Yeah, but you get it enough where it has to be in the glove compartment? 
[00:09:00]  No, no, no.  But I keep it there for emergencies.  Imodium makes you shit or not shit?  No, that fucking closes up everything nice.  What do you mean?  You spray it in your ass?  That's a pill.  Yeah, he's going to put me in the arm bar.  Oh, yeah, here's for Rich Voss.  BJ Penn trying to put Jimmy in an arm bar, but he can't find his chin to put the leg underneath it.  Look at that.  Still fucking caused some pain. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Was that scary?  No, but I realized that it was pulling me both ways.  And you see your arm pulling and your chest because his leg is pulling back, and you realize you're in deep trouble.  You couldn't get out of that and do a...  No.  No, he couldn't.  Revert?  That's why you tap.  No, you couldn't have gotten out of it.  I wish he was here to show you.  Yeah, Rich, you could get out of that.  It's BJ Penn.  Who the fuck is he?  I don't know.  He's a UFC fighter.  He's a former champion.  A former champion, right.  He lost his last fight, but yeah, he's the real deal. 
[00:10:00]  Speaking of...  He's a small looking.  Huh?  Yes, he is.  He fights at 155.  One of the smaller fighters.  155.  How much do you weigh?  Oh, fuck.  Who knows?  175?  No, I hope I'm 170.  I hope.  What, you think I'm more?  Way more.  Really?  Yeah.  No, fuck no.  I'm muscle.  I told you.  It's muscle.  It's muscle?  You don't have muscle?  Huh?  What, you work out?  I fucking work out, man.  What, are you kidding me?  You play golf. 
[00:10:30]  That's not working out.  Can I tell you a funny story about last weekend's gig?  Okay.  Sure.  I texted you.  I don't know if you got the text from...  Wait, wait, wait.  Are you texting...  You got a text...  Oh, well, I'll...  Testing his home number.  Yeah, I'll explain later.  I fucking was working in Allentown at a club called...  I don't know.  Did you do Bear Man Show while you were there?  No, they asked me...  My old friend.  They asked me to do something in Allentown, but I was in Ocean City the night before. 
[00:11:00]  And I was a special event for $15.  Oh, you did write me that.  A special event for $15.  Listen to this, Jimmy.  $15.  And then the regular price was $14.  If you weren't a special event...  I was an extra dollar.  So if you didn't have a half a cup of coffee, you were able to see me last week.  It was an extra dollar for me.  Usually when it's a special event price, it's like...  10 bucks more.  At least.  Honey, do you have four quarters? 
[00:11:30]  This is a special event.  I need an extra dollar.  It was fucking...  That's kind of sad.  Bonnie was cracking at me.  Of course not.  I couldn't do nothing but laugh when I saw this on the guy's website.  Regular ticket $14.  Special event with Rich Voss $15.  And there were some people going, you know what?  I don't know if I want to spend the extra dollar to see him.  I just thought it was quite funny.  You know, I don't know.  I think maybe...  It's more sad.  It is sad.  It is kind of sad.  It really is sad.  You guys want to hear a sad story?  That's a good point, too. 
[00:12:00]  But this week at Motley's in Boston, it's not $15.  Where's Motley's in Boston?  Where is it?  That's a new place.  It's been there for...  It's supposed to be a cool room.  I've never heard of it.  It's like in Faneuil Hall in that building or something.  Oh, all right.  That's where the old connection is.  The connection used to be.  It's somewhere around there or something.  Okay.  I can't wait to get up there and get some fucking lobster rolls.  Those fucking lobster rolls in Boston, man.  Holy fuck.  They are so good.  I'm telling you, you can't get any.  You ever have a lobster roll?  It's the fucking best.  I want the last 20 seconds of my life back. 
[00:12:30]  Do you want to take...  Really?  Yeah.  Why are you so excited about lobster rolling?  Are you crazy?  It's not so good.  You go...  I'm telling you.  If you go all the way out to Kelly's and Saugas or the other one, Revere, but you can get  them right at the Oyster House in Boston.  It's the oldest bar.  That's in Faneuil Hall, right?  Yeah.  And the fucking lobster rolls.  You can't get...  I will say the Oyster House is...  That's where JFK is to eat.  Uh-huh.  That was...  It's a great place to eat.  I miss Faneuil Hall. 
[00:13:00]  I miss that Boston thing, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I like living up there.  It's fucking great.  I don't think I had a lot of lobster rolls, though.  Oh, fuck.  Or they have...  Well, at Kelly's...  I haven't been there in 15 years.  They have oyster sandwiches, and they just fill the fucking...  What the fuck is an oyster sandwich?  Well, you take an oyster.  I like oysters.  They're not raw, right?  No, they're fried.  Fried oysters.  Okay.  Fucking unbelievable.  Boston's got some good fucking food, man. 
[00:13:30]  I'm telling you.  I can't wait to get up there and eat.  I'm not going to eat for two days.  You don't care about the gig.  You just want to eat a lobster roll.  You just want lobster rolls and fucking golf.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy, did you see the WEC?  Speaking of BJ Penn, even though BJ Penn is UFC, obviously.  That fight was...  That fight was...  The whole card was fantastic.  That whole fucking card was great, man.  Faber Aldo.  That whole card.  Because they showed...  If you noticed, they showed the pay-per-view fights, and I think to make it a longer event, 
[00:14:00]  they showed some prelim fights and some earlier fights from the night that were on the pay-per-view.  Because a lot of it was first-round knockouts and submissions, and every fight was great.  The whole card was great.  But Faber Aldo was...  I mean, I think we kind of knew that Aldo was going to beat him.  He's just...  We knew Faber was going to have a tough time, but he was our boy.  The only reason he was our boy, because he was the only one that called.  Well, Aldo, he couldn't have spoke to you.  He doesn't really speak English.  That would have been kind of cool.  Yeah.  Patrice probably could have talked to him, and they would have agreed on a prostitution price. 
[00:14:30]  But he's Portuguese, Brazilian, but...  Patrice speaks a little Portuguese.  Oh, sure he does, yeah.  But he doesn't know how to speak to a guy like Aldo.  He knows how to negotiate.  Yeah.  Some pussy prices.  He knows how to do a girl down.  He, what a fuck...  This Aldo is fucking...  He's got to be one of the top four or five fighters.  And this is how good Joe Rogan is.  In the first round, Faber was very aggressive, throwing these front straight leg kicks hard. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, the foot stomp, right?  Yeah, a few of them.  He was throwing pretty decent ones.  Those foot stomps.  What?  One of those would take me down.  Yeah.  Please don't do that.  And he was very aggressive and hyped up.  And Aldo was kind of hanging back and throwing some leg kicks.  And I looked to me like Faber won the round.  And my girlfriend, of course, you know, she's like, I don't know, I think the other guy won.  I was like, shut up, Dykey.  But, uh...  Sure enough, Rogan goes, all the really key punches were landed by Aldo.  Like, it's just amazing how he sees a fight. 
[00:15:30]  And Aldo was...  He was leg kicking Faber.  I mean, but I mean horrendous.  He actually floored him with a leg kick.  He spun him around with a leg kick.  Anybody that saw that Faber-Aldo fight, you didn't have...  First of all, if you saw the fight, you didn't have time-worn cable.  Because I called, oh, but we were going to see it.  But I'm like, yeah, me and my girlfriend are glad to eat.  He wanted to see it on delay.  I'm like, I've got to see this live.  Yeah, I had to.  Well, you know what it was?  It was so late, I hadn't eaten.  I had shot for 13 hours the night before, and I hadn't eaten at all.  So it's 10 o'clock this night, and I'm like, I have to eat. 
[00:16:00]  So we, uh...  Me and my girl are going to go eat.  And, uh, I tape it on Time Warner.  I buy it, and I tape it.  So I come back, and it's not taping.  And I'm angry.  And it's lit green on my guide.  And there's a little dollar sign.  So I called the fucking cable company.  And this is why I want Fios for my bill.  Cable sucks a dick so bad.  Do you know you have a $100 pay-per-view limit?  Do you know that?  What?  On your cable?  What are you talking about?  This Time Warner cable, you fucking stink as a company. 
[00:16:30]  You're a terrible company.  What do you mean a $100 limit?  You can only order $100 worth of pay-per-views in a month.  Why?  Why wouldn't they want more?  Because...  Because people don't pay their bills, maybe?  People's kids had run the bill up, and I said, well, I'm sorry that you have such trash  that pays for your service.  But I pay my bills.  And I'm like, why would your fucking service allow me to order this and not tell me?  I'm like, your computer knows everything.  You know exactly where I live.  When I'm ordering this, you know exactly what account to go to.  Right.  Why does your computer not know to tell me you can't order this? 
[00:17:00]  Call the company.  And I said this to them.  I'm like, you've never made an error in my favor.  Not once has the computer ever mistakenly knocked money off my bill.  Because they double-charged me for a pay-per-view I got earlier in the month.  Mm-hmm.  Fucking ass.  What a terrible...  And they had problems in Manhattan on a blackout.  There was a black screen for their HD channel, so you couldn't get it in HD.  Right.  First WEC pay-per-view ever, and you couldn't get it on Time Warner in HD.  Wow.  What a shit company, Time Warner Cable.  It's terrible.  And a $100 limit. 
[00:17:30]  Can you buy pay-per-view on every cable network?  All of them can.  I don't know if all of them have the limit.  I had mine up to $250, but you have to ask.  Look, I understand why they do that, but like you said, they could go into your account in the computer  and realize you're a good customer, you're paying your bills, you like...  They could even figure out that you like MMA stuff because you're ordering the pay-per-view.  It should be a no-brainer.  Or how about they say, if you're a parent, you can put a block on it.  Exactly. 
[00:18:00]  How about they put the onus on the parents, and again, instead of people like me who pay our bills.  $100 limit is crazy because...  It's childish.  Because the WEC was about 40...  What was it?  40, 45.  44.  44.  They're like $45, so I was at $99.  I was so aggravated.  Boy, they're a...  If you're a Time Warner Cable, you are...  And I kept telling the woman, and I didn't curse at her, so she couldn't hang up on me.  I'm like, this is...  Wait, is that the deal?  You can yell and scream as long as you don't curse?  I didn't yell and scream either.  You can't...  I don't think you can be abusive.  Right.  But I was talking in this tone.  I said, I just want you to know that your customer service is despicable. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, but don't you get...  When you're talking to them, you know it means nothing to them.  Not true.  I'm like, I'm not attacking you.  That's not what it sounds like.  She didn't like it at all.  I'm like an employee who doesn't give a fuck.  She doesn't have stock options with the company.  What if she care?  And it also...  I kind of agree with Rich a little bit.  You're right.  That's what's frustrating.  When you do get a customer service person, you realize they're just some dummy trying  to make a living, and where does this go?  Well, how about this?  How about that?  But what we get to do is, all right, fine. 
[00:19:00]  We're going to talk about it on our radio show.  Well, I told her that, and she's like, the complaints go nowhere.  They don't go...  Nobody finds...  If you complain to a customer service rep, nobody finds out.  So anyone who's ever had problems with Time Warner Cable, and I imagine...  Just keep calling the cable company and letting them know you want your complaint heard.  It's the only way they respond is if you talk to these despicable people, because they  all have monopolies on these companies, so they can just continually fuck you and fuck  you and fuck you, and you can't go to Cablevision or whatever else you want. 
[00:19:30]  We don't have a choice here in Manhattan.  No.  Anywhere.  Anthony has a choice.  Anthony got sick of his local cable company.  Anthony...  It's his birthday today.  He's taking his birthday off.  But he had some problems out there on Long Island with his cable, but he had choices.  His house.  So he dumped his cable company and grabbed Fios.  Me and Jimmy live in here in Manhattan in these buildings.  We don't have a choice.  We're stuck with Time Warner.  The building has to be wired for Fios, and I don't know if that's the building or Verizon.  What about, like, DirecTV or something like that? 
[00:20:00]  I don't know.  You could do that, but again, your building has to have a certain hookup, and I don't  want DirecTV.  I'm not really sure what our buildings get.  Yeah.  I was talking with Ann over the weekend, and he was saying how Cablevision already called  him to try to woo him back.  Of course.  Right.  And then you got up and went and got him coffee.  That's funny.  Why, Rich?  I like that one.  So, yeah, I mean.  To think that Ann would drink anything but alcohol.  I know.  It's silly part to me.  You blew it.  It might have worked if you said it, and you got him a Guinness or a Bud Light. 
[00:20:30]  So they're already begging him to come back, right?  Yeah.  Within a month of switching, they want him to come back.  And all they want to do is offer you, like, well, we'll beat the price that you're paying  now.  Well, yeah.  Well, they should be.  How about you beat the service that I'm getting now?  Well, how about you just take care of the customers you got?  Start there.  Start there.  I told the woman on the phone.  I'm like, do you know that people are leaving you for Fios?  I'm like, I just want you to know that.  It's because you work for a despicable company.  And I told her, and I wasn't getting anywhere with her, so I told her. 
[00:21:00]  I had her on speakerphone.  I'm like, you do know that I am taping this conversation.  I happen to have a job.  I wish I wasn't.  I'm like, I have a job in radio.  She's like, ah, that's not okay.  That's illegal.  I'm like, why is it illegal?  She's like, well, you didn't tell me.  I'm like, are you taping me?  And she went, yeah.  I'm like, she said, well, I think so.  I'm like, you didn't tell me.  Right.  And she said, but that's just so, I'm like, I don't care what it's for.  That's not my business.  You didn't inform me that I was being taped.  Oh, and I make her life fucking miserable without yelling at her.  But that's the only thing that these people respond to. 
[00:21:30]  They don't respond to just customer service because you're right.  They don't have stock options.  Right.  They don't give a fuck.  I agree with you.  They're terrible.  I call Oxford.  I got a new insurance.  Why would you call Oxford?  No, I got Oxford.  I think you meant the university.  So I got the health insurance.  Oxford cable?  What happened?  I'm talking about cable stuff.  What happened?  It's the same thing.  It's customer service.  Oh, we're doing customer service now?  My bill was.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Your show.  Go ahead.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We're talking about customer service.  No, no, no.  I'm talking about you here.  Fucking Oxford.  No, no.  Bradshaw.  Customer service.  Go.  Yeah, go ahead.  Relate to Jimmy's problem by talking about Oxford. 
[00:22:00]  He's talking about customer service.  We're talking about cable.  All right.  What did you get?  Boniva?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I'm just, if you're talking about customer service, I got stories.  No.  All right.  Let's hear your customer service.  Let's please.  All of them.  When I first got my new insurance in January, it was $1,200 for myself, Bonnie and the baby.  $1,200 a month.  So I paid two months.  Oh, just where they fucked up and you called them and they're like, sorry, I made a mistake?  Yeah.  You already told that story.  No, I didn't.  Did I? 
[00:22:30]  How did I know the answer?  Because I told it to you in the car.  No, you didn't.  Yeah, I did.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay, I'm sorry.  It's a good one.  Go ahead.  All right.  So, and then two months later, I'm just saying, we're talking customer service, too.  All right.  I'm with you, Rich.  When you're doing it, what he's talking about.  Like the customers who are paying for Sirius right now are not getting their money's worth.  Listen to me.  Punchline.  Eyes open.  What I'm saying.  What, do you close your eyes during a punchline?  Yes.  The audience is starting to do this.  Shut up.  Extra buck.  So, two months later, I get a new bill for $1,650. 
[00:23:00]  I go, that's an extra $450.  They go, well, we made a mistake.  I go, well, who do I complain to?  And they go, well, you can file a grievance.  I go, who do I talk to?  They go, nobody.  They couldn't even bump me ahead.  You have to ask for a supervisor.  You say, I would like to speak to your supervisor.  But I had the same problem with Horizon Blue Cross.  They stink, too.  The point is, there's nothing you can do.  They're terrible.  I mean, at least we have an outlet where the radio show, and that at least makes us feel 
[00:23:30]  a little better.  But people listening to us right now, they're calling customer service all the time and  getting nothing done.  Nothing.  I feel so bad for people that can't come on the air.  Because at least you know by going on the air, at least you know you're hurting.  Maybe there's one person or two people that are going to order it that don't.  It's like, if that's the least you can do.  A great example, when Anthony talked about switching from his cable company to Fios, I  guarantee a lot of people follow suit.  A lot of people went to Fios because Anthony's rant.  I guarantee it.  So we got something done that day. 
[00:24:00]  My cable problem is that my internet goes out, and I have to reboot the box like once  a week.  What the fuck is that about?  And I call them, and I get the runaround, and they go, try this, try that.  But it's still the same fucking problem.  Once a week, I'm rebooting.  It's a terrible service.  I'm paying over $100 a month.  I shouldn't have to reboot.  I pay $212 a month.  For a fucking cable?  Because I got every channel.  Yeah, I get everything.  I'm a...  It's a write-off.  I'm a high...  I use it. 
[00:24:30]  I'm in the high 100s.  Yeah, okay.  I think I'm 170, 180.  You're an entertainer.  You can write stuff like that off.  You know, if you use it legitimately for work, and it's like, you know, that's why I have  it.  So there's something like I can watch it.  But how can you...  I mean, I'm sure there's a million things you can write off, which you can.  How you, what do you call, rationalizing watching something on TV helps your career?  I mean, tell me, as a comedian who talks about things for a living, like, you don't  see how watching films and movies to talk about, or like, all the events you can see  on TV, or all the topical shows, every fucking channel has these reality shows, you can talk 
[00:25:00]  about every news channel you can talk about.  It's like...  All right, well, okay, I...  It's not a stretch.  How do you rush?  No, it's not.  It's not a newspaper.  That's a stretch.  That's not even...  That's not at all a stretch.  How do you rush a lot?  Wow, I don't think it's a stretch.  Not even a little.  That's good.  To write that off, you don't think that's a stretch?  No.  No.  Is that a stretch?  No.  Yes, calm down.  Relax.  Jimmy's job is...  The internet is...  You get all the information there.  Are you writing that off?  That's also a write-off.  Hold on, let me call my accountant.  Wow. 
[00:25:30]  Rich, what's wrong with you?  Of course it is, dude.  As long as you can't...  Not that we did a huge break on it, but Jimmy saw the WEC pay-per-view and just talked about  it on the show.  Yeah.  So that's...  He's working right there.  Any of this stuff, papers...  One of the times...  A hell of a time, I don't feel like we're fucking reading the paper.  I don't feel...  But I'm like, you know what?  It's my fucking job to kind of know what's going on and to fucking talk about it.  I do red eye once a week.  So it's like fucking...  Yeah, I have to kind of watch and be informed.  It's part of my gig, man.  So yeah, honestly, it's not even a bullshit write-off. 
[00:26:00]  That's a legit one.  If you're in entertainment, that's a real write-off.  You could write off your computer, your cable...  To a certain degree.  You can't...  Look, you can't buy a $10,000 computer and write the whole thing off and say, I use it  to type jokes.  You gotta...  You know...  Yeah.  It's gotta be...  Within reason.  Within reason and honest.  Spectro in Michigan.  Oh, but I had the same internet problem where I'm rebooting all the time.  After about the fifth tech visit, a guy replaced the modem and solved the problem.  I don't want tech visits.  I pay you a lot of money for my cable. 
[00:26:30]  I don't want tech visits.  That's what the fuck it is.  It's my modem why I keep having to reboot.  You do it once a week.  I gotta do it like three times a night.  Three times a night?  I gotta get a new computer.  Where are you?  You live...  Yeah, you live...  In Jersey.  Okay, you could get Fios.  What's that?  He loves the Fios.  What's Fios?  What are you talking about Fios?  Is that through the phone line?  What the fuck is Fios?  What do you think Fios...  I've seen the commercials.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, Danny.  I've seen the commercials.  What do you think Fios is?  Let's start.  Fiber optic network system. 
[00:27:00]  Fire.  Fiber.  Fiber's DF.  What do you think it is, though?  A fiber network.  So what do you get with Fios?  I don't fucking know.  You probably get a lot of fucking fiber.  I don't fucking fiber network.  It goes probably, you know, through your house.  Well, you said you saw the commercials.  So what do you see?  It goes probably through your house.  You know, like...  It's like, you know what I did last time.  Fios is nationwide, right? 
[00:27:30]  Or is there other companies doing...  Is it going to your phone line?  It's gotta go through something to get to your house.  Where is Fios right now?  It's across the country, but...  It is.  They're updating, you know, the...  So...  It might not be in your neighborhood yet.  I gotcha.  But it is nationwide.  So what are you saying, like...  I'm just making sure that people understand what we're talking about.  Oh, is it fucking wireless through your neighborhood?  Is that what you're saying?  It goes wireless throughout the fucking...  How the fuck does it get into your house?  That's what I want to know.  Through the phone line?  It's gotta get in there somehow.  The guy carries it in.  Keep talking. 
[00:28:00]  Talk it out.  Talk it out.  I'm just saying fiber optics.  Fiber optics.  Okay.  So it's...  I'm not trying to play dumb.  I just want to know.  But you've seen the commercials.  What are you thinking of?  I don't fucking pay attention because I don't...  I never thought I was going to get it.  Explain the commercial.  I've seen a lot of commercials.  Explain the commercial you've seen for Fios.  I don't know.  Which one is it?  And then I'll explain it.  Is that with the guy with the red hair and the other guy?  Okay.  Who's the other guy?  The fucking fiber optic network seller for the fucking fiber.  I don't fucking... 
[00:28:30]  Who's the other guy in the commercial?  Am I supposed to know the guy?  Am I supposed to know the actor?  Why are the two guys in the Fios commercial?  One guy is the Fios guy.  Yeah.  Who's the other guy?  The red hair guy.  You talking about that commercial?  Yes.  He's the cable guy.  Okay.  Good.  Okay.  Good.  So the cable guy is not getting any...  He's not closing any deals because the fiber optic guy is in there fucking snatching everybody up.  Very good.  So then now you can explain what Fios is.  It's a better company. 
[00:29:00]  For?  Due to their advertisement.  You know, they're not going to advertise fiber optics and go, well, we're not selling as much as the cable guy.  So obviously they're going to lean towards their own product.  Okay.  I mean, that's sales.  If you're selling a product, you're going to lean towards what you're selling.  There is a point in there.  Okay.  A little bit of a point.  Okay.  So I don't pay attention because I always think, well, okay, I have fucking cable TV.  Okay.  And my internet goes through cable and all this.  So what the fuck?  Am I going to just get rid of everything and start over? 
[00:29:30]  Some people think Fios is way better than cable.  So how the fuck does it get into your house?  And here's the thing for you.  It's a choice.  So if you're not happy with your cable system where you live, you can at least maybe call Fios and see what they have to offer.  They're probably going to do that, but how do you get it into your house?  And see if it's something you want them to do.  How do you get it into your house?  Does it go through a...  They have to, like, dig a huge trench and lay pipe?  No.  Is it...  Big plumber.  Is it fucking wireless that goes through the neighborhood, you're saying, through the phone lines? 
[00:30:00]  It's not wireless.  See, you don't know.  It's not...  No, it's fiber cables.  You're not going to dig a fucking hole in cable just for one customer.  Yes, your building has to be wired for it in New York.  I don't know how they do it in a house, but there's a wire that goes to your house.  One simple wire.  Really?  It's not wireless.  And is it quick?  It's way quicker.  And now, is your TV, is your cable hooked to the fiber optic too?  I mean, is it one fucking...  Can you fucking download and buy movies through that too? 
[00:30:30]  You can do everything on this that you can do on cable, and it's got better bandwidth,  and it's got...  I don't know exactly what makes fiber optics fiber optics, but it's much better than...  Wires.  Well, glass, right?  I know it's wires.  Yeah.  But it's...  Yes, Danny.  It's light pulses.  Oh, is it light pulses?  Okay.  Through glass, right?  Yeah, through glass.  Much better than regular...  Do you have better bandwidth?  Uh, from what I've read up about it, uh, Fios is faster. 
[00:31:00]  Uh, there is a percentage that Fios is faster than typical, uh, you know, broadband connections.  See, I'm with Comcast, and they're like the mob, because once you get in, you can't get  out.  They fucking bought up...  They...  It's like they're buying everything.  It's a monopoly.  It's a monopoly.  And I don't know.  I'm going to check into this whole...  You should check it out if you're not happy with your cable, uh, system.  So, I know.  Hey, uh, did you do your homework assignment?  Well, I got a couple of things, you know.  Who came up with this idea?  It's pretty good.  What? 
[00:31:30]  First of all, last time I was here, when, uh, this fucking Facebook that you helped me  set up this fucking fan page...  Yeah.  ...I didn't log out, and you guys fucked up my whole Facebook again.  Well, why aren't you logging out?  No, but what, you know, what the fuck?  Why do you act like kids, you know?  Ooh.  Ooh.  You got a treasure.  Oh.  Oh.  Why do you act like kids?  I know.  It's like fucking...  Really?  What told you that?  The fact that we like cherries thrown at girls' assholes?  Why do you act like kids?  Yeah.  You're like...  Look around.  This isn't...  This isn't reality.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:32:00]  We have the best fucking lives on the planet.  What are we supposed to do?  Act like adults in this dumb environment?  Well, maybe help the guy the fuck out.  We did help, but if you're not going to fucking sign out of your own Facebook, you should  expect that.  What did they do that was so bad?  They put up fucking dumb pictures, old ones.  I don't know what the fuck they did.  I just went back in it and switched to fucking...  It really wasn't that much.  I remember it was just a couple little things.  The profile picture was changed to that awful, terrible boss in mid-sneeze picture, and 
[00:32:30]  I just changed his relationship status from married to single.  Yeah, but all these people are emailing me going, oh, I'm sorry, or what happened.  It was just fucking, you know.  It's kind of good.  You know what's coming.  I mean...  Huh?  You and Bonnie doing okay?  What's that?  You and Bonnie doing okay?  Yeah, we had company over last night.  That means a black bull came over, and they did a little cuckolding.  Oh, I could be so lucky.  Who were the company?  You got, like...  Another comic couple that are friends of ours, and they come over for dinner. 
[00:33:00]  Brian McKim and Tracy Skeen.  Do they have that magazine, Shecky?  What?  I don't know them.  You don't know them?  No.  I'm sure they know me.  Probably, most likely.  I don't know them.  Brian McKim?  So you hang out with other couples that are comedians?  No, they're the only one.  Well, I mean, if Ralphie was in town, we'd hang out with him and Lana if they were in town.  You know Ralphie, he's who do the show.  Yeah, of course.  Ralphie still does the show.  I like Ralphie a lot.  Oh, I don't know. 
[00:33:30]  I was just saying, because he doesn't come around a lot.  No, we haven't had a problem with Ralphie.  No, I'm just saying, because he hasn't come around a lot.  I'm just saying, if you remember.  Right.  No, we like Ralphie.  Who else?  You know, that's probably the only couple.  You know, and they came over.  I guess things are okay with us.  I mean, what the fuck?  I've been on the road so much.  You know?  Did you, so we asked you to bring in, what, today?  Five?  What?  They said, just talk about tech shit.  No, but we, what do we suggest for him?  Five tech gadgets? 
[00:34:00]  His favorite five tech gadgets or something like that?  Yeah, and why they're cool.  And why they're cool.  You can't come up with a list of five.  I know I got three off the top of my head.  All right.  You want to take a break and we can talk about that?  Let me explain something real quick.  When, about assignments.  Okay?  It's not an assignment.  It's just a fucking.  Well, that was the word you fucking used.  All right.  I don't know about what you used.  We casually asked you.  Fucking bring in.  Give us a list of five.  Fucking Steve is.  Jamoke texts me at like 1 a.m. 
[00:34:30]  Or 11 a.m.  Hey, can you do this?  Or then the other one.  Would you put on an electrical dog collar?  What am I?  A fucking listener?  No, I'm not going to put on electrical.  Hey, we did it.  Huh?  We did it.  I had to give you two.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me explain.  Some emails were going around last night.  You're coming in and you're really good at tech talk.  So we want to take advantage of that today.  And we were going to get a little tech quiz or something together and have you wear a dog  collar.  And if you've got something wrong, we're just going to zap you. 
[00:35:00]  What's wrong with that?  Oh, really?  We get all the questions, right?  We don't zap you.  Oh, that's good.  And it's kind of a win-win for me because if, you know, because either I get zapped or I  get nothing.  You don't want to be zapped by the dog collar?  No.  Really?  Because you're not a listener?  Maybe if I get them really wrong, you start pulling teeth or do stuff like, why don't  we really, you know, make this happen?  Don't give us, don't give us, give us the ideas.  Yeah.  Put on a dog collar and get zapped. 
[00:35:30]  What the fuck?  We all got zapped by the dog collar.  Oh, probably one time real quick, right?  It's not fun.  If you get your questions right, you don't get zapped.  Come on.  Well, how about if I get them right, then I get something as a, as a fucking, as a prize.  Maybe I'll give you money or something.  Something that's fucking reality that could happen.  Okay.  I'll give you money.  What are you, what were you again?  The feature?  No.  You were the featured comic that night?  I don't know, the special event.  The special event. 
[00:36:00]  The featured comic.  The special event.  Jesus.  All right, so you're not doing the dog collar, but we could still talk about tech and your  tech gadgets?  I would love to talk tech.  I fucking learn so much when I leave here.  I'm already going to go get to Fias.  Fias?  Yep.  I'm going to get it.  You're going to get to Fias.  I think so.  Jimmy?  If it speeds up my computer.  Fias isn't going to do anything.  What's so funny about that?  If it goes quicker.  Fias is...  You just, he just said it goes, it's quicker than I said. 
[00:36:30]  If it speeds it up, he laughs.  I don't understand.  So you're going to call who?  Whoever fucking sells it.  Fias.  No, that's, that's the, that's what you're buying, but you got to buy it to a company.  I guess either Verizon or, or whoever the fuck sells it.  I got to do research.  It's not, you know, there's no Fias company.  What am I, a fucking idiot?  Yes.  But...  Jimmy's speechless.  Huh?  Fias, right, Jimmy?  I don't know what to say to you.  What are you talking about?  Fias. 
[00:37:00]  What do you call it?  What it's supposed to be called.  What is it supposed to be called?  Fios.  Oh.  Big deal.  These guys are sort of like, oh, big deal.  So technical.  The kids are joking again.  Oh, we're just saying the word right.  Uh-huh.  I don't, I don't think we're being snooty by going, no, it's not Fias.  We're saving you the humiliation of saying it wrong.  Right.  On the following.  You won't even be able to find Fias.  Fias.  How do you spell Fias?  F-I-O-S.  So why would you pronounce that Fias? 
[00:37:30]  F-I-O-S.  What is Fias?  What the fuck?  F-I-O-S.  Mars is dying.  He's laughing so hard.  Fias.  Now put it, put it together.  Fias.  There you go.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Just want to hug you.  But then you'll freak out.  Because you don't like human touch.  No, he doesn't like human touch.  Look, look, he gets all fucked up.  But in wrapping up, to go bring it back, if you didn't see the fight, see it. 
[00:38:00]  Even though you know who won, check it out online if you can.  Did you see the picture Uriah Faber was tweeting last night?  No.  It's on my Twitter.  Nice way to promote me today, OP Radio.  But his fucking leg?  What is that?  He was kicked.  Did you find that, Danny?  He was kicked.  This Jose Aldo.  And Aldo could have, I think, knocked him out at the end.  But I really think that he was being merciful because it was his hometown. 
[00:38:30]  I think he was just being a fucking sportsman because he had really beaten the shit out of him.  Yeah.  This guy, his kicks were fucking horrendous.  Don't you panic?  I don't know how far now it was.  Like if someone got you when you were a kid and you were wrestling and they got you under it, you'd panic and stuff.  That's claustrophobic behavior.  Well, no one likes to be held by another person in a violent way.  There you go.  Look at that leg.  Danny, can I see that?  What the fuck happened?  It's all over the internet.  He was being kicked from being fucked from fighting.  Who's, uh...  That was his left leg. 
[00:39:00]  Okay, you can go to Uriah Faber's Twitter.  U-R-I-G-A-H.  It's J-A, isn't it?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  God, I'm sorry.  I believe it's J.  It's catching today.  U-R-I-J-A-H.  I'm sorry.  F-A-B-E-R on Twitter.  You can see Uriah Faber's leg after the fight.  That's fucked up.  And someone was telling me on Twitter last night that he doesn't take painkillers.  This guy's never taken an aspirin in his life.  He just deals with the pain without any of that shit.  Look at the swelling. 
[00:39:30]  His knee is swollen.  And that's only a few hours after the fight.  Today, that's got to be even worse.  This Aldo, Jose Aldo, is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt.  He was like a world champion jiu-jitsu fighter.  Brazilian champion.  He's fucking 23 years old.  He is fucking really a dangerous fighter, man.  He's one of the best.  A lot of people talk about moving him up to UFC, but I think he should stay in WEC and fucking just kill everybody.  I saw some young guys fighting on that shit last week.  They were like fucking good, man. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, WEC is like they're lighter.  I mean, they're not so young, but they're all lighter.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  So after the break, Richard's got five tech gadgets that his favorite five tech gadgets out there.  You said you had three?  Oh, yeah.  You can't come up with two more?  Yeah, I'm sure I can.  Or two that you hear people talk about, maybe.  Just five tech gadgets.  Can you just write that little list for us?  Yeah.  You're right?  Yeah.  And where are you going to be?  Motley's?  Motley's in Boston this weekend. 
[00:40:30]  And having some of that lobster roll.  Just a lobster roll playing fucking Granite Lynx.  Yeah, email me for real.  Tell me about this course, Granite Lynx, people.  I heard it's like fucking great.  Where is it?  I live in the Boston area, but where?  How far is Quincy from Boston?  I forget now.  Maybe, let me think.  Is that 35 minutes, maybe?  Oh, is that fucking far?  I think so.  I think.  Yeah, it's like a half hour.  Half hour.  Oh, fuck.  Okay, yeah.  Oh, I got to get a hotel, you know, somewhere outside of Boston.  I want to stay outside of Boston. 
[00:41:00]  And that's too far.  Fucking a half an hour.  Fuck.  I got to find something closer.  Can you guys get me on some morning radio in Boston?  Do you guys have any connections?  Yeah, Toucher and Rich.  Who?  Toucher and Rich will have me on in a second.  They're big up there.  And they're in trouble, too.  Who can get in trouble?  Yeah, in this shitty, or maybe not in trouble, but it was mentioned that they said, you know.  What did they say?  They just talked about Tim Tebow, and I think it was Toucher who was just saying that there's  something, you know, it was all lily white, and, you know, he might be a Nazi. 
[00:41:30]  He was joking, you know.  And they're saying, well, I'm just got five percent.  They're not being at a hoes.  How come you get to not, you know.  Oh, please.  Fucking the whole country just sucks.  They're funny, man.  Tebow is such a goody two-shoes.  That's the joke to do.  Yeah.  Who's?  That maybe he's secretly a Nazi.  That's just a simple joke to do.  Who's the radio I did in Boston?  There's like four people in studio.  They seem like older guys.  Of course, there's a lady there, like three or four older.  I don't fucking know.  It's over by some industrial area. 
[00:42:00]  You just explained every morning show in America.  Exactly.  Do we have microphones and a button that says cough?  Yeah.  Give me a little more than that.  White.  So who's this Toucher and Tebow?  Toucher and Rich.  Toucher and Tebow.  Oh, whatever.  Rich and Tebow.  Rich and Toucher.  Who are?  Are they morning radio?  Toucher and Tebow.  They're not going to have you on now.  You don't even know who they are.  Well, I don't live in fucking Boston.  How am I supposed to know who they are?  Do you listen to our show? 
[00:42:30]  We have them on every once in a while.  No, I don't get up that early.  You guys won't turn on my XM.  We could call them.  Yeah, call them.  Get me on Friday morning.  We could call them like today maybe and do a couple minutes with them.  All right.  Let's talk with them.  Talk sports with them.  Are there sports radio?  They used to be like us.  But then they decided to take the station all sports.  Now they're forced to speak a lot of sports.  You know, they're big in Boston.  Yes.  They do really well.  They do very well.  CBS and all their brilliant radio moves decided to take a show that was as good as their show 
[00:43:00]  and make them do sports.  Although I think they're doing well with it, but still.  Mike in Boston is saying, let's go to Mike real fast.  Mikey.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Quincy's only like, depending if you're on the highway, 10, 15 minutes from Boston.  You can actually get to New Hampshire in 35 if you drive fast enough.  Wait, so you're saying Quincy's only 15 minutes from Boston?  You know what?  I'm losing it as far as my Boston references go.  I always thought it was longer than that.  All right.  I was just in Quincy driving through Boston about two minutes ago. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, I believe it.  Only 10, 15 minutes.  Yeah.  I believe it.  Yeah, go up 93.  You can get to New Hampshire in 35.  So you could get a hotel in Quincy.  Are you from the Boston area?  Yeah.  Well, his name's Mike in Boston.  Oh, I didn't hear.  Do you play golf?  Yes, I do.  How's Granite Lynx?  I have not been, actually.  It's a little pricey for my likens, but.  Uh-huh.  But yeah, I'm not that good.  Yeah, I heard it's expensive, but not for me.  You know why it's not expensive for me?  Why?  Because I just mentioned them three times. 
[00:44:00]  Because you're a flubbering ass.  That's plugola.  No, I'm only kidding.  You know they take you away for that, right?  Really?  Yeah.  Hey, Rich, let me pipe in real quick here.  You asked, does it come wireless, you know, through the phone line?  Are you kidding, Rich?  Wireless through a phone line?  I didn't say that.  Is that what wireless is?  Holy shit.  That's when Jimmy went speechless.  That's a good point.  You actually said wireless through the phone line.  You did say that, Rich.  Be careful.  You don't want to drive your truck into a ditch.  But you're right.  That's a good point.  Why make fun of Mike from Boston for pointing out that you might have made a little mistake? 
[00:44:30]  I didn't make fun of Mike.  What's wrong with you?  You should know eating yourself.  Really?  I didn't make fun of my truck into his big teeth.  That's right.  It's like a bunch of little walls.  Good luck, sir.  I wasn't making fun of Mike.  Mike was helping me out with the country.  And also, Bell in Hand is the oldest bar in Boston.  Bell in Hand.  Bell in Hand.  I guess that's the Paul Revere.  Bell in Hand.  Yeah, that thing.  I think that place has been around, I don't know, for like 200 years or something.  Oyster Bar is supposed to be the first bar in the country. 
[00:45:00]  I think it's Bell in Hand is the first bar in the country.  Maybe it's the first Oyster Bar in the country.  Maybe we can look that up.  I think Bell in Hand is the first bar in America.  Oyster Bar is so fucking good.  Is that the one where they used to stand around, they said like Webster would come in and they  would all like, you know, just throw stuff on.  That's the bar.  There's an interesting history to it.  Don't cough at me.  I went like this.  I know.  Right at me.  Yes.  Your hands are too small to cover.  His little fucking granite fingers are too small to cover his mouth.  So it looked like he was whispering to me and he started coughing.  That was the worst cover-up for a cough. 
[00:45:30]  This is what you just did.  That would be tiny hands.  You actually made it so it would go more directed to...  Doll hands.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, my God.  By the way, I had to do a photo shoot yesterday and I had to look at the photos.  I'm just ugly.  You just realized that?  No, but sometimes when you have 600 pictures to prove it.  Really?  I'm just homely.  No, you're not.  Shut up.  You get a lot of...  I mean, before you had a girlfriend, you had pretty girls in life.  Big deal.  It's because I'm funny. 
[00:46:00]  No.  Yeah.  No.  You're packing.  It's true.  Yeah, he is packing.  We've all seen it.  Decent dick.  If they can get past your stomach, your dick gets...  If they can get over that speed bump, it's a nice dick.  Back to Danny.  That bar's been there since 1795?  Yeah, Bellingham is the 10th oldest bar.  10th oldest?  Yeah, so there's still nine more bars older than Bellingham.  How old...  We understand what 10th old is.  How...  How fucking...  Well, for rich, you kind of have to explain things a little extra.  And there is an 11th that is not as old. 
[00:46:30]  Now, the Oyster bar...  Oyster bar, is that above that?  Probably 1982.  No, no, let's see.  Number nine is Warren Tavern in 1780.  Where's that, though?  For America.  For America.  Charlestown.  Charlestown, Massachusetts.  Okay.  And you have The Tavern, 1779.  In Abington, Virginia.  In Arlington.  I'm sorry?  What does that say?  No, I'm saying there's one in Arlington, too.  No, you're not.  There's at number seven, the Griswold Inn Taproom.  That's 1776.  And that's in Essex, Connecticut.  Okay. 
[00:47:00]  The Horse You Came In On Saloon, 1775 in Baltimore.  Fuck, I want to go to a couple of these places.  Yeah.  Jean Lafitte.  Blacksmith shop.  In New Orleans.  Uh-huh.  Française Tavern in New York.  Wait, where's that one in New York?  That is 54 Pearl Street.  No kidding.  Okay, we got an old bar here in New York.  That's kind of cool.  The Pirate's House in Savannah, Georgia.  That's number three.  Yeah.  Uh, Middleton's Tavern in Appalus.  Uh, 1750.  And, uh... 
[00:47:30]  Number one.  The oldest is the White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island.  Wow.  What the fuck?  Where is the Oyster House in this?  Maybe it's an old Oyster House, Rich.  Yeah.  Damn.  1671, Denny?  Yep.  For, uh, 73 for the White Horse Tavern.  That's the oldest bar in America.  That's pretty cool.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We'll continue with Rich Voss and Jimmy today.  And happy birthday to little sweetie.  Yes, happy birthday to him.  Hope he's vomiting into a toilet on his shoes.  Taking his fucking birthday off.  What's he, 18? 
[00:48:00]  That's a great hat.  That's a great hat.  Yeah, UFC sent us a whole box of stuff, man.  Thank you.  Is there any more of those hats?  You want one of those hats?  I don't look good in hats, but let me look through these hats.  Ah, put the hat on, Jimmy.  I think you look terrific in hats.  Oh, well, you're just being loving.  No, I really think you are.  Come on, my head's clean.  No, this one.  Oh, okay.  God.  Rich, look how nice he looks in a hat.  See?  Oh, my God.  Why don't you look good in hats? 
[00:48:30]  I don't know.  It would be the head, I think.  What is...  You think it's just the head?  Yeah.  Oh, let me see that one.  No, no, no.  Yeah, that's a hip hat.  Try the hip hat.  That's fucking, uh, what's his name?  Barnes' hat.  Yes!  Ricky Barnes wears that.  You're going way too inside right now.  Can't follow me in this hat.  Uh, E-Rock will be tweeting the fucking, uh, hat picture.  Jimmy just doesn't look good in hats.  I don't get it.  Let me see this hat.  No.  We're doing radio, Rich.  I can't see mine.  I can't see yours.  You're right.  Exactly.  Rich, put your hat back on so we can fucking do some radio, please. 
[00:49:00]  Thank you.  Why?  My hair's a mess, huh?  I don't notice that your hair's a mess.  Bonnie is supposed to notice that stuff for you.  I just don't look good in hats.  What do you notice?  Did I just have a nice, thick, full head of hair?  You do have more hair than me.  Oh, I was.  And you're, what, 10, 12 years older at least, right?  And you got a lot more hair than me.  Jesus, look at that head of hair.  What the fuck, Rich?  That's because there's nothing directly under it.  It's fucking a root, it's a root system where the brain should be. 
[00:49:30]  That's a nice, nice hat.  The UFC is great here.  That's what I'm wearing.  You got one of these?  Yeah, right here.  Don't wear the same fucking hat as me.  That's mine.  What are you putting my hat on for?  You didn't want me to put your fucking hat on?  Are you going to keep it?  Yes.  I don't look good in a lot of things.  I keep fucking major Jewish hair in my fucking Catholic hat.  Oh, fuck.  I'm sorry.  Hey, do we have a Bret Michaels update?  What a bummer that was when that hit on, I think, Friday.  Bret Michaels had a massive brain hemorrhage.  Fucking amazing.  Was rushed to the hospital.  I guess my update is that he's in critical condition, but he's talking, though, right? 
[00:50:00]  He's talking, but he's got slurred speech.  He's got blurry vision.  I've had that my whole life.  He's got a few things going on, and they can't figure out where he's bleeding from still.  That's because he won't let him take the headband off.  That's what a lot of people said.  You would think he wouldn't fucking brain hemorrhage.  Get out of here.  Is that fucked up?  With that headband of his, you'd think it would keep it all tight and nice for him.  What is a brain hemorrhage exactly?  I don't fucking know. 
[00:50:30]  I guess your fucking brain starts bleeding badly.  That's all.  So I don't know what causes it.  I don't know.  I mean, maybe Dr. Steve could call today and explain the brain hemorrhage thing.  Yeah, is it stress or, you know.  If he's going to be our doctor, if he's going to be the show doctor, he should be prepared and he should be on the line.  Exactly.  With his brain hemorrhage information.  How about you do a little doctoring?  Yeah, let's do this.  Bret's such a nice guy, too, man.  Steve, what do we got on him?  Have you met him?  Oh, many times he's been.  He's a great guy.  He's probably, a lot of people around here have said it, one of the nicest guys we've ever had on this radio show. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, I hope he's all right.  He's just such a great guy.  Yes, Steve.  I talked to Pete, his guy that, one of his road managers over the weekend, and he can't comment directly on it, but one of the things I said was, I've been reading a lot about Bret and the tabloids.  I tend not to believe it, what's really going on.  And the only thing he said was, believe it, it's bad.  He's still in the ICU.  They don't know what's causing it.  And, you know, they'll keep us posted.  But, yeah, he's in bad shape.  Yeah, he's in bad shape.  Well, he was in there a week ago with, what, his appendix or something like that? 
[00:51:30]  Like, yeah, early April.  So they're thinking maybe somehow the two are connected.  I don't know.  I don't know how the two would be connected.  One is, you know, way down there, and the other one's way up here.  So how's that connected?  Blood clot or whatever?  I mean, I don't even know.  Let me say hi to Megan in D.C.  Megan.  Hi.  Hey, what's up, Megan?  I need advice from Jimmy.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, Megan.  Thank you.  It's Anthony's birthday today. 
[00:52:00]  Well, all right.  Here's my problem.  So should I go on?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  My husband got kicked out of a massage for getting an erection.  Okay.  And I don't believe that they would do that because I think it's probably really common for guys.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You can't just, like, walk us through it a little bit.  Yeah.  You can't just casually say he got kicked out for having an erection.  Where did he go and what happened?  Right.  Where was this?  It was one of those chain massage places.  He got burned up in a fire. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, God.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  All right.  So he goes to one of these chain massage places, right?  Yeah.  So, I mean, one that's definitely on the up and up because it's like a chain, you know?  Right.  Okay.  And he said that she was a lesbian and she was telling him about her girlfriend and all  this stuff and he, you know, it started to get turned on and he, like, turned around and  he had wood and she got all freaked out and, like, ended the massage and told him he had  to go and that there were code violations.  All right.  So this is why we asked you to explain it. 
[00:53:00]  I mean, if the massage therapist is talking about her lesbian experiences or her lesbian  friend, how are you not getting an erection?  Was your husband pushing his hips up?  Was he indicating to her that he wanted her hand, like, to go to the erection?  You guys are really fuzzy.  It's really hard for me to understand you.  I'm sorry.  Can you ask me that again?  Was your husband pushing his hips up or kind of moving a little bit to indicate that he  wanted the therapist to touch his erection? 
[00:53:30]  Well, that's what I don't know because I don't feel like they just kick people out of normal  massages just for getting an erection if they're being totally...  Something's suspicious here because if she's...  I mean, a normal massage...  The massage therapist isn't going to start talking about her lesbian friend, you said?  Yeah.  Well, he said that she was talking about her girlfriend and stuff.  I mean, I'm sure she wasn't going into, like, great detail to get him excited.  Right.  Right.  Your husband may have just got a rod and maybe he didn't do anything. 
[00:54:00]  Maybe it just did bother her.  If she's a lesbian, maybe she was bothered by the fact that his dick got hard.  He could be just telling you the truth, too.  He probably said, what are we going to do about this?  Maybe pointed at it and said, suck it or die.  Right.  Maybe your husband isn't telling you everything.  Maybe you're not doing your job at home.  All right, Rich.  Why do you have to go there?  Poor Megan calling her show.  I tried.  You know, I also was calling in to say that you guys are too mean to Rich, but now I changed  my mind.  Oh, yeah.  Good.  No, I wasn't talking to you.  Say your only fucking friend. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  I was going to say...  Why can't we talk to him, Megan?  What?  I would love to talk to him.  Oh, he's not with me.  I'm in the car driving to work.  Oh.  But he just...  He insists he didn't say anything untoward.  Maybe he didn't.  But where is this Svengali?  I mean, I believe you.  If he's telling you about his experience, then I think that, yeah, obviously something  weird happened.  I just don't want to throw another guy under the bus.  No.  For doing what I would have done.  So what was the question for Jimmy?  What was the what? 
[00:55:00]  What was the question for me?  I forgot what the question was for Jimmy.  Oh, I just wanted to know if it was possible that they would have thrown him out if he  really hadn't said anything.  Not the places he goes to.  Yeah, the places I go to, they throw you out if your dick doesn't get hard.  I don't know.  They hit him with a hammer if it doesn't get hard.  Sure.  I mean, that's not that crazy to think they would have thrown him out.  Chances are...  Look, most times I think that people have gotten thrown out, they've asked for something.  But he might not have.  It's hard to tell with some therapists sometimes.  Some legitimate therapists will do things that you think, like, eh, maybe. 
[00:55:30]  And then it turns out they are legitimate and they just happen to brush your asshole lightly.  But, like, it really wasn't actually...  Like, you never know.  So who knows?  Well, he was very depressed about it.  Did he have to pay?  He didn't have to pay, did he?  No, he didn't actually have to pay, I don't think.  He was probably mortified, though.  He has a fucking boner and they're telling him to leave.  Oh, God.  That's a legitimate place.  They always...  His little robe is tenting out.  Everyone knows what just happened.  Boo.  Puts his jeans back on and his mushroom head is popping out the top as he walks out. 
[00:56:00]  His swollen red cock head and he's got to go home and sit next to Megan.  How was it?  No, I forget it.  He's using his belt to tie it down to make sure it doesn't pop as he's walking through the mall shamelessly.  Now, how did he tell you he got kicked out?  Did you ask how it was?  Well, he...  They just said they have to end the massage early.  Ah.  All right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He was very embarrassed about it.  And I wasn't even in town.  I was all the way across the country. 
[00:56:30]  I bet he was scooting his hips like a dog on the rug.  Maybe she was hinting at something and he didn't pick up on the hint and then she was annoyed.  Like, maybe it wasn't a legitimate place.  He thought it was.  She's doing the lesbian talk shit to go, you know, hey, you could get some more action here.  And he didn't pick up on it.  And then maybe she was annoyed because she wanted to move on to the next guy that might pay a little extra.  Or maybe she was getting weird vibes from him.  Maybe she was getting some kind of sexual vibe from him and was trying to say, oh, yeah, my girlfriend... 
[00:57:00]  What was your first clue?  The raging hard-on when he turned over?  Or maybe she was rubbing the back of his leg and he kept bucking his hips up to get her fingers close to his balls, which he didn't want.  So maybe she mentioned she had a girlfriend as a way to go, hey, back home, I'm gay.  I'm not into this.  I don't know.  Okay.  Yeah, we don't know.  That might be possible.  I think he'd probably been drinking and he definitely starts turning girls off left and right when he's been drinking.  Would you be mad at him if he was trying to get his dick jerked a little bit?  I don't know. 
[00:57:30]  I mean, I guess I could deal with that.  I mean, we've done some pretty crazy stuff, so I don't know.  Like what?  Like what?  Yeah.  You know, just like some swinging stuff, so...  Well, what's swinging stuff, Miss?  There's a lot of...  Let's get into it a little bit here.  I want to know.  Not like hardcore or anything.  Okay.  Not like full swaps, just like...  Full what?  Swap.  It's where you fuck her and she fucks your husband.  What kind of swap did you do?  Partial or just...  What's a part...  What's this rule?  Maybe blowjob or handjob.  It's like not a full fuck. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, like just mainly like just the two girls hooking up.  And what are the two guys?  Do they just jerk each other off on the couch and drink a beer?  No, they kind of participate, but only with the girls.  With their own girl.  Yeah.  So basically, you girls are like making out, eating each other's pussies, and the two guys  are fucking.  You.  Yeah, kind of.  So did you, did either one, did both of you girls blow each guy, though?  Um.  Come on.  I guess we've done some of that. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, fuck.  Not like, not like a ton, though.  We haven't...  Go ahead.  I don't know.  We have a, we have a kid now, so we can't do stuff like that.  All right, well, fine.  Don't include the kid, the babysitter, just don't bring him over.  So she's pulling the other dude?  Yeah, so both of you, both of you kind of blew, you and the girl, who did you blow together?  What, you and what girl, like, not her name, but like, you and a girl blew her husband  and your husband?  Well, the problem is we're, you know, we're not too popular when we meet people because  I don't mind seeing him with other girls, but he minds seeing me with other guys, so 
[00:59:00]  it's like, you know, he'll be like, oh, I can have your wife, but you can't have mine.  Who, who goes for that?  That doesn't sound like it would be.  Your husband's an asshole.  Who goes for that?  Unless you know...  It's pretty clever if you think about it.  What's that?  It's pretty clever if you think about it.  But that's like cuckolding, unless another guy...  Does your husband, like, have a big dick?  Um, yeah.  He does?  Yeah.  All right, so maybe another guy would want to see a guy with a bigger dick fuck his wife. 
[00:59:30]  Maybe that would be an attractive quality to this couple, where, you know, the guys  end up being cuckolded like that, but I can't quite...  Why would you do...  On principle, I would never do that.  What, the whole thing?  No, no, no, no, if I was with a girl, I don't think my girlfriend would do it anyway, but  if I was with a girl who would do it, or, and the other couple where the guy wants to  fuck my chick, but I couldn't touch his, I'd go, fuck you, buddy.  On principle, it would annoy me.  Oh, no, no, I know.  He's aware that, you know, it's the lessons or opportunities.  Well, that's fine, though. 
[01:00:00]  What if you were, you guys were with another couple, and you and her were fooling around,  and then you looked over, and he was blowing the other guy?  No, for real.  What would, would that freak you out?  What would you do?  What would you do if his cheek was puffed out like he was eating a lolly?  What would you do?  Like, would you go, I mean, because you're eating pussy, you know, say.  I don't think, I don't think I would like it.  It's just not something that I like the thought of.  Obviously, we can never get together.  How about if you looked over, and your husband was sitting on the floor with his head back on  the couch, and the other guy was sitting on your husband's face, and your husband was 
[01:00:30]  eating the other guy's rusty asshole?  Oh, my God.  Would that be a problem?  And then he came over to kiss you.  Would that be a problem in your marriage?  We have some really good gay friends that are going to love listening to this conversation.  No, but would it turn you off?  It's a very good question.  Listen to me closely, please.  Would it turn you off if the other guy was sitting on your husband's face, getting his  ass eaten, jerking off, yelling, help daddy come?  Help daddy come. 
[01:01:00]  Would that turn you off?  Um, yeah, I think it would.  That's too bad, but I guess it would.  Wow, you guys got some double standards in your relationship.  It's okay for you to eat puss, but he's not allowed to get his fucking throat fucked.  What happens if you were laying on your back in your pussy, and you open your eyes, and  you see your husband's eyeballs on the bed, because he's getting rammed in the ass so hard?  Oh, God.  What would you do?  If you and the other girl were making out, and you looked over, and the other guy was 
[01:01:30]  standing over your husband, pissing in his mouth, would that turn you off?  It's fine, guys, but I gotta go to work now.  What?  And then he gets on the phone and has an argument with Time Warner Cable.  Exactly.  I like that.  He lied about something.  He was in a massage place, and it was an Asian gentleman who was rubbing him.  And he asked for a little sucky, and the guy goes, you have to leave, sir.  I don't do that.  And you know what happened?  I called Dr. Laura.  Your husband grabbed the crotch of a male massage therapist.  He reached over, and he let his knuckles brush the guy's cock as he was standing there massaging 
[01:02:00]  him.  And he cupped it, and the guy was like, whoa, buddy.  And the guy turned your husband around and goes, what are you, a lesbian?  Your husband, that's what happened.  Your husband hit on a male massage therapist.  Looks like you have double standards in your relationship, man.  Yeah, trying to get his fucking pole tugged.  What's wrong with you?  You're licking pussy.  Yeah.  Why can't he have a little pussy?  Yeah, the other guy wants to toot on a little meat.  Let him go.  Let him play the meat flute while you're sitting in God's eyes. 
[01:02:30]  Let him do the same.  Oh, fuck.  Megan, comment?  Yes.  Yes.  What is he allowed to do with another guy while you're eating pussy?  Right.  It's never a question, because he doesn't want to do anything with other guys.  Daddy tells you.  How about if they weren't stuck in each other's jigs?  How about if you just heard your husband go, ah, and spit on the other guy's cock, and  then just grab it real rough and madly and stroke it with his own flu spit on it? 
[01:03:00]  Would it turn you off?  It's been great.  One more question.  No, one more question, man.  One more question.  Yes.  Jimmy?  Would it turn you off if the other husband sucked your husband's dick, and then you went  to suck it and there was flu breath on your husband's dick?  She wanted no part of that fucking discussion.  You knew? 
[01:03:30]  Dick isn't hard.  I challenge anyone.  We lost Dr. Steve.  He was going to explain the whole brain hemorrhage thing.  That's a scary thing.  It started with a headache.  Bad headache.  He's complaining of a headache.  Went to the hospital or whatever.  They rushed him to the hospital, and his fucking brain's bleeding.  I'm glad he's alive, though.  He's a really good dude, man.  I hope he's going to be okay.  Yeah, me too, man.  Thanks.  And he's on that Celebrity Apprentice.  Yeah.  Big episode last night.  Yeah, which we were maybe supposed to be in but weren't, and we don't know why.  Well...  We're trying to find out behind the scenes what happened.  Well, we had Sharon, Brent Michaels, and Maria... 
[01:04:00]  Maria on the phone?  On the phone, and we did a great segment for the Celebrity Apprentice, and they wanted the audio.  And then, you know what?  I've talked to our guys.  I've talked to the bosses, and there's something going on.  So, Celebrity Apprentice wanted to use the footage bad, but they're saying, through our  guys, that the lawyers here at SiriusXM made it a major problem with the contract that they  sent over for us to sign, and they wanted the contract rewritten, and by the time it 
[01:04:30]  was rewritten, it was too late for the Celebrity Apprentice people, because they were already  editing the episode.  Celebrity Apprentice saying our guys, meaning the lawyers here, blew it for us.  And they said that there was a two-minute stipulation or something, they could only use two minutes  of the Opie and Anthony show on Celebrity Apprentice, no more than that.  If that's true, what Jimmy would say, you can only advertise for free for two minutes? 
[01:05:00]  Right.  If Celebrity Apprentice wanted to make it into an Opie and Anthony episode, why would that  be a problem?  I think there's more people watching Celebrity Apprentice than listening to this horse shit,  and especially today.  Fucking dummy.  Sorry, Rich.  Dummy.  Blame it on you, that the show sucks so bad.  What dummy would say that?  Yeah, I cut you guys out of Celebrity Apprentice.  What fucking dummy would say, only two minutes?  Do we have Sam here?  Holy shit, that's true.  Well, he was in the middle of the... 
[01:05:30]  Well, I asked...  Wow.  I asked some people around here, and they go, well, you know, the lawyers got back to  them, and there was no problem on our end.  I'm hearing there was a major problem on our end.  If that's true, I hope somebody tells Mel that it's like, how counterproductive is  that?  It's like you want free advertising and mentions, and if the legal team here screwed up, it's  unforgivable.  Sam, what do you got on this?  Wait, what do you got?  I was just showing gym wear. 
[01:06:00]  Now, you're not going to get in trouble.  Just tell us what you know about this situation.  All I know is the Celebrity Apprentice people really enjoyed the interaction we had with two  of their people, three of their people, when they were in, you know, doing their show.  Basically, when Brett, Michael, Sharon were in, and Maria was on the phone, they, the Celebrity  Apprentice people first contacted WWE and said, who's your connection at Opie and Anthony,  because we want to get the audio and the video and stuff to play it on the show.  Yeah, because we were filming on our end. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  And so...  And at the very least, they had the, the radio portion.  Right.  God, they want to be in, damn this, it's, what the fuck are you doing?  And so they put them, they put them into contact with me.  Right.  And I said, yeah, that would be great, no problem.  Like, I was, I started cutting up the video so I could send it to them, had E-Rack get  the audio.  Right.  And they sent over the contracts that they needed signed, just the releases.  They needed you, Ant, and Jim, because you were in studio.  And then they needed whoever had the intellectual property rights over the Opie and Anthony 
[01:07:00]  show, like whoever actually owns the audio.  I remember you came by and said, all they need is a signature of who technically owns  the show.  Right.  And this thing was, this was, the green lit, as they like to say in the corporate world.  This was going to be blue sky.  This was going to be fucking baked.  Right.  This thing was going to be a no brainer.  It was, it was up to a hundred seconds for free.  I guess after that, they expected to be paid.  Brilliant.  What?  So what happened was, I, uh.  Wait, can you read that letter?  It just says, it's up in grad, it's legal bullshit writing, but it just said up to 
[01:07:30]  a hundred seconds.  What, what, Sirius XM was only going to allow up to a hundred seconds of us on Celebrity  Apprentice?  That's what you do when you want your platform plugged for free on a fucking major network,  is you put a limit on it.  You inconvenience the network so they can't plug you for free.  Why would they put a limit on it?  Because there are people involved that don't understand the value, apparently, of a free  plug on NBC. 
[01:08:00]  It doesn't, if, if that's, you should say.  They only would allow a hundred seconds, why would that even be an issue?  Why would you do that?  So.  These fucking lawyers don't understand the big picture ever.  I gave you.  And what does it matter who owns the fucking show?  Who cares?  You're going to be on a Celebrity Apprentice.  Just make this happen.  And then people hear this fucking fun dialogue going back and forth, people who are not probably  customers, and they see, oh wow, you're getting these celebrities on this fucking satellite  radio platform. 
[01:08:30]  It's a no-brainer commercial for the Open Anthony show.  It is a free fucking commercial.  And anyone that doesn't understand, anyone, whether you're a lawyer or an executive in  any company, the value of your audio being played for free when you're a subscription  service on another platform, then you should not have anything to do with the company.  If you don't understand how valuable that is to expose yourself for free.  Because I got a lot of tweets last night.  People were like, it was so obvious this was your episode or the show's episode that you 
[01:09:00]  guys should have been on it, because we walked everyone through it going, oh my god, this  is going to be on the Celebrity Apprentice.  We got the video, we got the audio, there were a lot of big, huge fucking laughs, plus  they were explaining what they were doing for Celebrity Apprentice.  It was a no-brainer.  I am so aggravated that that, what a, what horrendous thinking that is.  What do you got, Sam?  Wow.  Now I went to Steve Blatter, who then in turn went to Gary. 
[01:09:30]  Gary, Gary's one of the guys that, I don't know, I think he's like a babysitter for the  channel or something.  He, he got back to Steve and said, no, there was no problem on our end whatsoever.  They, they, they did everything they were supposed to do.  Maybe.  Well, I gave the, uh.  It doesn't sound like that.  It doesn't sound like that.  Why would you rewrite the contract?  Why not just say, unless, uh, the only time I can understand I've re-writing the contract  would be if NBC.  Rewriting the contract takes a, takes a long time as far as lawyers go.  Well, this show is not a priority with the platform, it seems like it's never been, but 
[01:10:00]  it's like, unless, unless NBC, the only way I would say it makes sense, wanted to be indemnified  if anything was said here.  It's almost like if NBC wanted to show the Sirius audio or play the Sirius audio and then  be indemnified after they play it, then I could see Sirius going, fuck you, no way.  That, that makes sense to me from a business point of view.  But to actually say, up to a hundred seconds, here's what it should say, here's what it  should say.  If you know anything about-  What are you holding, by the way, for the people out there?  It's a contract that was signed. 
[01:10:30]  That's the contract that they eventually rewrote.  Who rewrote this?  Sirius XM rewrote it.  I gave the intellectual property contract to our legal guy.  Right.  And he said, I'm going to rush this through as quick as I can because usually this stuff  takes a while, but I know-  What do you mean quick as I can?  Because he said there's like eight people that you're going to have to go through before  Oh, great job.  I just, I hope-  And then when they came back-  Well, obviously someone blew it because we weren't on the show.  And they made it very, perfectly clear to us that it was such a good segment on our show 
[01:11:00]  that they definitely want to use something from it.  Up to a hundred seconds.  This should say, for as long as you fucking like.  Yeah, if they want to turn it to the Opie and Anthony show last night on the Celebrity Apprentices,  why is that bad for the company and us?  Someone explain that to me.  Wow, man.  They basically said, the original thing that they said was, you know, and I was checking  it took like, I don't know the exact timeline, but I would estimate about three weeks before  I got this contract back.  And they said while that was going on, that the main issue was that there was nothing in  the NBC contract, or whatever, whoever's contract it was, that said SiriusXM would be plugged. 
[01:11:30]  And they said it was a necessity that they used-  Great job, yeah.  SiriusXM had a mention on there.  And so they said that's what it was.  So like, whatever it was, three weeks or so later, I don't know the exact timeline.  They just wanted a mention at the end, right?  Yeah.  Then why could- that should have taken an hour.  That should have taken a fucking hour, and then this should have been messengered back  over and said, look, we're just- you're happy to use it, but just because you're not going 
[01:12:00]  to show video of it, it's only going to be audio, we would like people to just know where  the audio came from.  And NBC probably wouldn't have a problem with that.  Right.  If they do, fuck them.  They rewrote the con- they completely rewrote the contract, the whole new contract, and then  once I got this new contract, I immediately faxed it over to them, and was emailing saying  I set the contract, and then a couple days later, I emailed again saying, hey, I didn't  hear back from you, and the person I was in contact with said, yeah, I think they're  kind of done editing, but I'll let you know if we need that stuff. 
[01:12:30]  Cool.  Well, if that's- apparently, according to them at least, it was blown on this end.  And if it was blown on this end, what happens is, when you go to negotiate the contract,  and you say, well, what does the Opie and Anthony show have to bring to the table?  And all these things that could make the show more valuable, that are fucked up, that  go- it's beyond our control.  Iraq, you got something else on this?  And again, I haven't heard anybody's side here either, so you can't- I don't want to  throw this company into the bus if they're right.  What do you got, Iraq?  You came into the studio. 
[01:13:00]  Let me see.  What's up?  How many viewers?  6.91 million viewers, number five in adults overall.  So that's good.  Put a limit on how much they could show to 6.9 million people for free.  Call it seven.  Seven million.  I understand wanting to mention at the end, though, that you should get that at the end,  because you're going to let your audio be played without being shown.  It's like you can see these- what are these called?  Mic flags.  The mic flags.  If there's no mic flags that can be seen, I understand wanting a friend at the end. 
[01:13:30]  No, man.  There's so much- because Cigars and Scotch is online.  I don't have time to go to your cigars.  But, uh, look, there's signage all over the studio.  They might have only played audio, though.  What they basically wanted was to guarantee that in the corner of the screen while it  was going on, like, say if they just showed Maria on the phone and there was audio playing  that it said, Opie and Anthony show Sirius XM.  That's what they- they wanted that guarantee.  You know what?  Even if you don't get that, I mean, if she's saying Opie- just saying Opie and Anthony would  be great for us.  Well, I mean, they wouldn't- I mean, I wouldn't think that they would, just from a television standpoint, 
[01:14:00]  just play the show- of course they're not going to just fucking-  They're not going to mention what show it is.  Fucking dopes.  It's amazing to me.  So, I just- maybe, look, maybe Mel knows and he's cool with it, but it's like, if he  does it, he should know that there are things being done that are extremely counterproductive  to free fucking plugs.  And this is going to- this is going to hurt some people, but we got amateurs running the  fucking channel.  We got amateurs that don't understand how important this would be, and they don't have the skill 
[01:14:30]  set to figure it out so it gets done.  Eric Logan would have got this done.  Simple as that.  We have amateurs.  Like, oh, okay, they don't see how important it is.  They don't see how, holy shit, if we have to go to Scott Greenstein or Mel Carmas and  personally, we got to do this because this is really big for Opie and Anthony and SiriusXM.  Eric Logan noticed, understood when there were opportunities in front of our fucking faces,  like, holy shit, we just got to get this done and not deal with lawyers going back and  forth and shit, it's just good for everybody. 
[01:15:00]  We have fucking amateurs with skill sets that don't understand how to get this type of thing  done.  Especially since that was when Sharon was trashing Susan Boyle.  Right.  And that was when that whole thing happened, so they very well may have played that on  The Apprentice because it turned into a big thing.  Of course.  So, just really horrendous.  That's the difference.  Counterproductive lawyering.  It's going to hurt people, but Logan would have got that done.  Period.  Period.  Period.  Wow.  That is fucking embarrassingly bad. 
[01:15:30]  Thanks, Sam.  For us, we got fucked out of a celebrity apprentice mention or appearance or something.  Anything from a mention to a nice piece of, a nice chunk of audio or video being played  on that show that seven million people watched last night.  Seven fucking million people.  We got amateurs with bad skill sets that don't understand how to get this type of shit done.  I would love an explanation as to why it didn't happen.  And they babble in front of my face all the time.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:16:00]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm fucking biting my finger.  I'm so aggravated.  I don't...  When something is just counterproductive because there's so many channels and levels and layers  to go through and people don't know how to just go to one guy and go, look, could you  take care of this?  This is important.  Nobody fucking communicates like that in any corporation anymore.  Mm-hmm.  No one.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And if the people that babysit this channel, I don't like saying they run this channel 
[01:16:30]  because that's a joke.  You know, if they just are just passing it along to lawyers and assuming they're going  to do the right thing, that is amateuristic right there.  Because the lawyers don't give a shit.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't care.  There's nothing in it for them.  It's like the old lawyers in our old company.  It's not that they hate the show, but they don't give a fuck because the success of  the show has nothing to do with them or their success rate.  The thing that they care about is litigation. 
[01:17:00]  And that's every lawyer cares about that and the lack thereof which makes them happier.  See, I purposely Tebowed the show just so I could see ONA on Celebrity Apprentice.  Yeah, because it was very obvious that it was a great segment.  They definitely would have wanted to use this.  Somebody fucked up.  I want to get to the bottom of this.  I would love to.  Who fucked up?  And if it's a lawyer, what lawyer?  Why is everybody protected by layers?  Why don't people's names ever get used?  If I fuck up, everybody knows Jim Norton fucked up.  So why is everybody not held as accountable? 
[01:17:30]  And one of the babysitters of the channel should, that's all they should have been doing.  Like lose sleep over it and make sure it gets done.  Don't just pass something on to some lawyer.  I haven't even met these lawyers.  I don't even know where they are in the building.  There's so many people.  They just fucking hide in these weird fucking glass offices and you never see them.  You never talk to them.  And then you hope that one of the babysitters is doing the right thing and fucking, you know, making sure it gets done.  And it doesn't get done, ever.  Because you don't have the skill set.  You just don't. 
[01:18:00]  You're nice guys that babysit the channel, but you don't know how to get things done.  Eric Logan knew how to get things done.  That's the big difference between the two fucking places.  When a company wants, here's what satellite radio does.  One of the things it competes against besides iPods and a lot of other things is it competes against free radio.  So, if you can get a plug for a pay service that's competing against free shit, you take the plug. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, you fucking bend over backwards to get it done.  And you don't take weeks to get it done.  But the lawyers, you know, well, my dick's bigger than your dick.  Oh, really?  No, I think my dick's bigger than your dick.  And they go back and forth and argue.  And instead of just pulling their fucking pants down and going, okay, wow, you do have the bigger dick.  What you got to say is, what would a minute and a half of advertisement time cost on NBC during prime time?  Of course you have to do that.  And that's what they blew.  They blew whatever it would cost on fucking...  Look at Rich being smart.  We all know how dumb he is. 
[01:19:00]  And it's like...  No, I know about...  But you figured it out like that.  If the lawyers said, look, we would like some kind of a mention that at least it was our platform, and NBC said no,  then the lawyers have the right to go, well, fuck you.  But to take three weeks, if that's how long...  According to Sam, that's how long it took.  If that's how long it took...  It took a...  Yeah.  If it took more than a week, it is inexcusable.  That took a long time.  Inexcusably bad.  And when this came up...  It was a blown opportunity.  When this came up in a meeting, and someone just casually said, no, we, you know, we didn't, you know, we did what we were supposed to. 
[01:19:30]  Wow.  Also, too...  Fucking no, you didn't.  When you're negotiating, and you're the smaller part of the negotiation, if NBC, if apprentices put you on, you basically have to go with how they want to put you on.  Because they could...  That show's been going on for eight years with or without the Opie and Anthony show.  So if they say, this is what we want, you go, okay.  As long as what they want, as long as what NBC wants, wasn't unreasonable.  Like, as long as...  You can't tell NBC how to produce their fucking show and say you have to put Opie and Anthony bobbleheads in the fucking corner. 
[01:20:00]  They're not going to do that.  If all you get at the end is a mention...  Do you know how clothing companies will give clothes to people and hosts so at the end it says, this wardrobe has been furnished by.  Like, the whole time Leno is on or Letterman's on or Conan's on or anybody on television's on, you don't see this wardrobe furnished by.  Right.  You don't see a fucking guy from the men's warehouse in the corner tap dancing so you know it's mentioned at the end.  It would be worth for the company and us if all it was is one of the celebrities going, I'm talking to Opie and Anthony right now. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Because then people go, Opie and Anthony.  And they might do a little research on their own going, well, that was kind of funny on Celebrity Apprentice and they mentioned Opie and Anthony.  So I'm going to fucking Google Opie and Anthony.  Oh, they're on SiriusXM and the next thing you know, you're getting something out of it.  You just are.  That is just terrible.  All right.  Well.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  We just got babysitters that babysit the channel.  Well, I don't have any faith in them getting real stuff done for us.  But the system.  I just don't.  You know what?  The system that's in place, lawyers should be able to look at that and go, this is important. 
[01:21:00]  You don't make NBC wait three weeks.  They're fucking NBC.  Right.  Right.  It's NBC.  Right.  Fuck, man.  Well, I'll fucking talk to Mel and see if anything could be.  Because I can't talk to these other guys, all of them.  But there's five layers of managers here that do nothing.  It's like, stop.  I'll go right to the big guy.  He'll explain it to me.  And if I'm wrong, trust me, he'll make sure it fucking hurts.  And he'll make me look like a fool.  But there's nothing wrong with asking.  We heard it took three weeks to get back. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  Why would it take that?  If that's the truth, why would it take that long for some simple language over fucking  airy audio, which is done all the time?  This is not that uncommon.  It's not that they wanted to come in here and fucking borrow the satellite for two weeks.  The guys on Al Q were on Celebrity.  Brian in Arkansas.  Brian.  Yeah, I hope he.  Al Q, when the Celebrity Apprentice first started, Cindy Lauper had called in to do an interview at that time. 
[01:22:00]  And she called Larry at another time and they just sent him a release to sign and they were  going to play him on the show.  So did they, so did they play it?  Yeah.  Now, did they?  They were, they were supposedly going to.  I didn't know if they were going to touch it, but he was always going to play it when  they were on the release.  Okay.  They played it so you could hear Larry Flick's audio, like the camera was on Cindy Lauper and  you could hear Larry Flick's show through her cell phone and it said, it said Larry Flick. 
[01:22:30]  So that's, so why would that take, if they've already dealt with the platform?  Why would that take three weeks to get, why don't they just take Larry Flick's fucking  contract, photocopy it, white out his name, put Opie Anthony and send it back and go,  you've already done this.  Let's just do it again.  Same thing.  No, that's somebody fucked up.  Oh, yes, Steve.  That is exactly the question I was trying to get answered, which I don't have yet, but  what I got from Gary is Sirius sent their, sent over their contract. 
[01:23:00]  NBC never responded.  When did Sirius send over their contract?  How long after?  Was it three weeks, Eric?  Three weeks.  Why was it three weeks later?  Wait, what?  Sirius XM gave the contract to them three weeks later after they requested the audio or video?  Here's the thing.  Yeah, here's the thing.  The production company that owns the rights to The Apprentice sent over a contract for  you guys to sign and for the company to sign.  Right.  We handed that off.  Right.  Sirius, after a few weeks, then handed their contract back saying that NBC or that company 
[01:23:30]  had to sign permission on our agreement, not we signed their agreement.  But it took a few weeks for them to pass it back to NBC.  Yeah, I can find the exact timeline, but it was about three weeks.  Okay, but it was more than a week.  It was definitely more than a week.  It should have been a day or two.  See, if that's true, Gary, you don't have the skill set.  You just don't.  You don't have the skill set to deal with what we're all about and what this channel's about.  If that's true.  I'm saying if that's true.  You just don't. 
[01:24:00]  Eric Logan would have got that done.  Eric Logan wouldn't have spent weeks fucking going back and forth with stupid lawyers knowing  how important this would be.  Holy shit.  You just don't get it.  Fucking shit.  You just don't fucking get it.  More or less three weeks.  You're a nice guy, but you don't fucking get it.  If that's the truth.  And the lawyers should do better.  How would that take three weeks?  How do you not understand the priority of a show that's in production?  It's like, have you ever dealt with entertainment things before?  There's a television show in production.  They're not going to wait.  They're just going to pass over it and go on without it. 
[01:24:30]  And they did.  Yeah, of course they did.  And you know what?  Seven million people still saw the fucking episode.  We needed them way more than they needed us.  That is embarrassingly bad.  That's embarrassingly bad.  We're the small guys in this.  That is embarrassingly fucking bad.  We've got fucking babysitters.  Not people that could get things done.  It's enraging.  Can somebody please just let Mel know?  He probably doesn't know.  The guy's doing stock things.  He doesn't watch every...  He doesn't know that this happened.  I got a relationship with Mel. 
[01:25:00]  I'll fucking email him.  No problem.  The only way to do it...  I can't deal with babysitters.  I need people around here that could get real things done for us.  Let the person who runs the entire company know, because this way he's aware of it.  He might be aware of it.  Have they gotten back to us about the homeless Charlie segment being rerun?  They still haven't gotten back?  How long ago did we ask for that?  A long time ago.  The last word I heard on that was...  The lawyers look at it.  Yes.  They had more important things to deal with.  Right now, at the time, was dealing with NASDAQ.  So...  Well, how hard is it to get a guy to look at that? 
[01:25:30]  Why wouldn't we be able to play it?  What's the issue?  They have the audio.  It was submitted.  And it's still in limbo.  And Gary just...  Is Gary, like, fucking pounding on their door every day?  Going, this is what's important for me and the channel and the guys?  Of course not.  Because that would take a real skill set.  Oh, God.  I mean, now, after all these fucking years, you would think things would be right.  But they're not.  They're never going to be right.  Oh, Logan, I miss you, buddy. 
[01:26:00]  Too bad you had to work for Oprah.  Fuck.  Just fucking make the call.  I'm out.  It's just embarrassingly bad.  Make the call.  I'll talk to chicks.  No problem.  I'll talk to big, fat fucking housewives.  I'll change my whole fucking act to work for you, Logan.  Please.  Just fucking call me.  You got my numbers.  I could do it.  I could talk about baking cakes if I have to.  Get me the fuck out of here.  Work for fucking people that get it.  Logan got it.  How many months?  Five months. 
[01:26:30]  That's embarrassingly bad, man.  Five months.  Five months.  Five fucking months.  How many days is that?  150 days?  150 days to go.  He had one or two for those months.  I have 31.  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  I'll call it about.  Let's call it 155.  155 days.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  I would love to know who's responsible for taking three weeks.  You never.  Why?  Yeah.  No, it went through. 
[01:27:00]  No, but it went through.  No, but because nobody.  The producers of the channel will go, well, no, we did everything right on our end.  And it'll be very vague.  And I'll go, can I see some emails?  Because I really want to see what took so fucking long.  This should have been a quick little thing.  This is why I loathe Pete.  And again, it's in television networks and radio.  It's in every type of business like this.  Everybody fucking hides.  Nobody just mans the fuck up.  Every person should be completely accountable for their end. 
[01:27:30]  Completely accountable.  By name.  But the homeless Charlie thing is obviously the bit that got us suspended from satellite  radio for 30 days and regular radio continue with us.  Now, it's been out there.  It's been blogged about it.  The audio has been all over the Internet.  But we want to replay it now that we're good and stuff.  And it's been about a year and a half at this point, I think, or maybe close to two years.  We're not sure.  Two years.  I think it was in the spring.  Okay, so about two years ago.  It was in June of 07, I believe.  And we wanted to play it.  And then they said, well, we got to wait for the lawyers. 
[01:28:00]  And then it's like, well, but all right.  And the lawyers have taken so long, we forgot that we want to even replay it at this point.  And we got a babysitter here that fucking hasn't pounded on their doors every day going,  look, my guys need an answer.  I need an answer.  The channel needs an answer.  You just accept that there's more important things to do right now?  That's not okay.  That's why I can't talk to you guys.  I need to get out of here right at 1030 when our show is over.  Can I tell you how great it was?  And I mean this, how fucking great it was. 
[01:28:30]  It's doing something for HBO.  I forgot how fucking well they fucking run.  How efficient they are.  How everything gets done when it's supposed to get done.  And how they treat their fucking talent.  Right.  Jesus fucking Christ.  I like working for them.  Well, at least cherry darts, Jimmy, wasn't an issue.  So that's good.  You know, we were supposed to do cherry darts.  Tomorrow, yeah.  But that got pushed back.  Why did it get pushed back?  What happened?  We had to tell people why it happened.  And this is why I call out the babysitters today. 
[01:29:00]  And this is why I say, once again, you don't have the skill set to fucking run our channel or our show.  What happened?  Because this is shit that should never happen.  Go ahead, Danny.  Well, apparently when the email address was created.  Yeah.  They created an email address.  So possible contestants for the cherry darts contest could contact us.  And we go, wow.  Okay.  Great.  Well, I started noticing that people were getting in touch with me saying, hey, I'm getting my email bounced back.  So I tried it with a few of my email addresses. 
[01:29:30]  And I got them bounced back.  But, you know, everybody was like, oh, no, it's fine.  It's fine.  It's fine.  So it turns out that the email address was only active for people internally.  So it.  Great job.  It wasn't open.  Who did that?  Who fucked that up?  The IT department.  The whole department?  Or was it one guy?  I can't answer that.  It's called the IT department fucked it up.  But.  The whole department fucked it up.  But the babysitters for this channel, right?  If.  I mean, they don't really have much to do.  Quite frankly, they get a nice salary for.  I don't even know what they do.  We have to fucking do this every day. 
[01:30:00]  What they do to help us.  I couldn't tell you right now, but at least if you're going to have an email address for  the cherry darts thing, if you're a babysitter, you would send an email.  This sounds stupid.  I know.  But you would send an email to that address for maybe an outside email address, a Gmail  or something, just to make sure everything is set and ready to go.  But this this went by their heads for what?  A week or two before they even realized this was this was a problem.  I had a feeling something was going on because, like, I was getting I was getting responses 
[01:30:30]  to my one of my personal email addresses.  But then, you know, we'd have meetings and, you know, be like, Eric, is anybody, you  know, we got any contestants yet at the other email address?  And the answer was always no.  I thought that was kind of weird.  Right.  Right.  Of course, it was weird.  But see, when I was coming up in this business and I had to do these, you know, these lame  jobs like they have, they got lame jobs.  You do the best at it.  So hopefully you move up.  So so if you know, the guy set up a special email address, it's it's a no brainer thing  if you got the skill set.  I'm going to keep saying skill set and babysitter all day long because that's what it is. 
[01:31:00]  You fucking get a Gmail address and go, OK, I'm Joe fucking listener.  Let me make sure that there's no problems with this.  Hi, I'm Joe fucking listener and I want to throw darts at my girl's asshole.  Send.  Oh, wow.  Fuck.  That never went through.  It was tested twice, but both times were from corporate accounts.  Yeah.  No, of course it's going to work with corporate accounts.  So basically, the lawyers fucked us out of out of the appearance.  We're not looking for for fucking contestants from from the corporate world that work at 
[01:31:30]  Sirius XM.  So why would you do it that way?  And the trust me, there's there's some fucking softballs I would like to throw at assholes  around here.  God, there's a whole bunch of these idiots I would love to line up and throw softballs.  So this week, we've been we've been chocolate covered fucking softballs.  We've been fucked out of the TV appearance and we've had this fucked all beyond our control.  So we have to.  Yeah, because we got babysitters all beyond our control.  This shit.  They don't know how to do this shit. 
[01:32:00]  They were music guys that they just shoved our way.  Nice guys, though.  Nice guys.  Terrific guys.  They know how to fucking program some of the music channels around here and do it very  well.  So why would that mean they would have the skill set to to work for the Opie and Anthony  show?  It's beyond me.  It's fucking beyond me.  So we should break.  But Cherry Darts is postponed.  I guess we could.  Yeah, postponed.  Officially announced that due to the fact that the email address was not working. 
[01:32:30]  Sorry, folks.  The email address wasn't working.  So like assholes, we're plugging this event like fucking assholes feeling like assholes  to like, wow, no one gives a shit about us in this contest we're running.  And the prize is really good from Steven Singer.  It was a nice iPad with fucking diamonds on it.  No one is responding.  And we're all looking at each other like, God, we're fucking fucking fucking embarrassingly  bad.  Wow, is that fucking embarrassing? 
[01:33:00]  Why?  Because when things happen that are beyond the control of the creative angle of the show  or the creative force of the show, it's very frustrating to have to rely on other people  to do things that are relatively simple.  Start an email address.  How about that?  That's not hard.  All we needed was an email address and something signed to get us on TV.  It was tested twice by a corporate email account. 
[01:33:30]  So that they assume that was good enough.  Why didn't the IT department fucking test it?  Why didn't whoever created it nameless?  There's no name.  The check just says IT department.  Why wouldn't they go, well, this could happen if it was only for corporate?  I don't know anything about that because I don't work for them.  So I understand that Gary or Blatter, they wouldn't know either because they're not tech  guys.  But how about you go to the tech guys and the tech guys should have known, well, you're 
[01:34:00]  testing it from an email address that's internal.  It doesn't mean anything.  Let's try it from another one.  That's the tech guys.  It's just fucking embarrassingly bad.  How certain things that should work don't work.  And you know who looks like fucking dickheads?  The show.  Yeah.  We look like cunts.  If you're one of these guys that are, if you're a babysitter for this channel, it should  be embarrassing how much you check shit. 
[01:34:30]  Check it a hundred different ways.  And people are like, you're insane.  Why are you checking it a hundred times?  You've checked it 99.  Just to make sure.  Because that's all your job is.  That's it.  It's the easiest fucking job here.  To babysit this fucking channel and do the basics.  Set up an email address.  You make sure it works a hundred different fucking ways.  You make sure it works if someone is using their phone.  You make sure if someone's using their home computer.  You make sure if they're using their fucking internet connection on their TV.  Whatever.  You try it a million fucking ways. 
[01:35:00]  It's no brainer stuff.  Or if you're the IT department, you don't set up an email address and then not realize  for weeks that only people that work for the company can fucking enter the contest.  I had a dream.  I've been doing radio since I was 18 years old.  I had a dream that at this point in my career, everything would be fucking nice.  Like everything would be nice.  I still fucking work with amateurs.  Fucking amateurs around me.  That's what I get after years of fucking service to this business. 
[01:35:30]  It's a bunch of fucking amateurs.  Send over.  It's all money.  Send over, like I said before.  My resume is going to fucking Harpo.  What do you think I could do for Harpo?  Nothing.  They would take one look at you and go, he has nothing to offer us.  What?  This is the guy that did what?  I could talk to Brugs.  I'm going to talk to the Brugs.  I'm going to talk to them somehow.  It's all money.  Tell them what they lost by not having it.  They don't care because do you understand?  The people that care, Mel would care. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  I think Scott would care.  He's the president.  I mean, I really do.  Those guys give a shit.  The attorneys don't care.  Not that they want to lose money for the company.  They don't.  But their priority is not that.  I'll go to Mel with this.  I don't deal with babysitters.  I go right to the main guy.  That is my privilege after all these years.  I used to talk right to the main guy at XM Logan.  I didn't deal with all the other guys.  And they were nice guys.  And I deal with Mel around here.  Not these fucking babysitter guys with lousy skill sets. 
[01:36:30]  When you want.  Very nice guys.  Terrific.  I'd go out and have lunch with them.  They seem like very nice people.  Sure.  Something would happen though.  Your email would get crossed because the address wasn't set up right.  So you wouldn't meet at the wrong time for lunch.  And they'd make you indemnify them in case you choked on a piece of steak.  Right.  It'd probably be a whole fucking...  It'd be a nightmare.  It'd be a nightmare.  Ugh.  We just wasted an hour on this shit.  I wish I could just fucking pass the buck.  You know, I guess I'm one of those people... 
[01:37:00]  Like on stage, if I'm bombing, you know whose fault it is?  Mine.  So I guess you get used to fucking owning up to when you fuck up.  When I fuck up, it's my fault.  We got all these guys.  And we have two big fuck-ups.  They would argue the celebrity apprentice thing.  I know they will argue that.  I would love to hear that argument.  They would argue that it wasn't their problem.  But, I mean, certainly, without a doubt, the Cherry Darts email problem is theirs.  If Celebrity Apprentice has already dealt with this platform, if it took three weeks... 
[01:37:30]  If they say, no, no, we got back to NBC in four days, then my apologies.  But if it took three weeks, then whoever that is should be fired.  Because they're bad at their job.  I'll tell you this, 155 days, there's going to have to be some big changes.  There's not going to be a big change.  There's going to have to be.  There's just going to have to be, Jimmy.  There's not going to be.  I had my choices when I came here.  They said no to all my choices. 
[01:38:00]  And then, you know...  And then the one guy I did like, he just...  Not decided, but they gave him a huge fucking promotion.  So now he's sort of hands-off watching these babysitters fucking run the channel.  I'm not happy.  Nice guys, though.  Terrific.  The one guy gave me the brand new MGMT CD.  I loved it.  I'm loving the new MGMT.  I want to thank him for the free CDs.  You're good at that.  You're good at fucking handing out free CDs and programming stuff.  I would never argue that.  I'm loving the new MGMT. 
[01:38:30]  Congratulations.  Didn't like it at first, though.  A couple plays through him.  I'm fucking digging it.  I mean, if you guys want to fucking hire me to stay on top of these people, because I know business.  You know, like I'm fucking furious about this NBC thing.  I don't care about tomatoes and darts and shit like that.  But this fucking NBC, or cherries, or whatever the fuck you want to throw.  This NBC thing is fucking insane.  I can't get it out of my mind that whatever it is, is you make it fucking happen.  Because it's incomprehensible that somebody in any company would be so counterproductive and stupid. 
[01:39:00]  It's incomprehensible that somebody would be that counterproductive.  Let's say hi to Steve in Connecticut.  Steve.  Opie, I've got to give you a round of applause, my friend, and your therapist, too,  because it wasn't that long ago, with this kind of BS from management,  you'd be ripping the studio apart brick by brick.  Well, there's a couple things going on.  My therapist made me realize that I'm actually a genius. 
[01:39:30]  I'm just fucking brilliant at what I do.  So whether I do it here, I'll do it somewhere else, so that doesn't matter.  Second of all, I would have ripped this whole fucking studio apart if I knew it would have made a difference.  The one thing over the years when I was fucking breaking shit, it made a difference.  And guess what?  It started at NAW.  They gave us a horrible, shitty fucking phone system.  It was in a wood fucking panel.  And I...  Who are those fucking guys?  And the phone system wasn't working. 
[01:40:00]  I was yelling and screaming for weeks.  You've got to fix the phone system.  They refused to realize how important it was, so I smashed the entire fucking thing.  Most guys would have gotten fired for that.  But guess what I had the next day?  A brand new fucking phone system, state-of-the-art.  So over the years when I did smash shit, the next day they replaced it with the stuff I wanted in the first place.  But I know if I break shit around here, nothing would change.  It wouldn't change, and they probably would just fire me.  That's the difference.  That's the difference. 
[01:40:30]  Rich Voss, Motley's, Boston, this weekend.  And now for our comedy segment.  Nah, with the lobster roll thing.  We're going to take a break.  Jim Norton, Pittsburgh.  This weekend, improv, bad mullets.  Jimmy is furious.  I'm more disgusted, and it really is just terrible.  Don't be confused.  I'm furious, too.  I just deal with it differently.  You've got to fucking take care of you.  I had such a fucking great time shooting Frasier.  I swear to God.  It was so nice. 
[01:41:00]  It was so...  Everything worked flawlessly.  Everything.  All right, listen.  Let's take a break, and we'll get into some other shit.  Jimmy's in Pittsburgh.  Where, Jim?  Improv?  Improv.  Friday, Saturday.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Tickets still available for some of the shows, possibly.  I'm sure they are, yeah.  I don't know.  Pittsburgh's a big fucking market.  It is actually a good market.  So, go see Jimmy in Pittsburgh.  Are you competing against the Penguins?  I don't think so.  Where are you?  Maybe? 
[01:41:30]  Probably.  I didn't think of that.  You know what?  It's a little rough, Jimmy.  I didn't even think of that.  A little fucking rough with fucking Crosby.  And Voss is going to be up in Boston in Motley's and Fenniel Hall.  Thursday, Friday.  By the way, you know what the guy who killed his wife because she was nagging him because  he's fucking watching the Penguins' overtime game?  We'll talk about that and some other things.  Love to.  What about the fucking hero that died on the sidewalk while everyone walked by him?  You didn't hear that story?  Someone took a picture of him.  I did not.  Oh, fuck.  We got shit to do.  Somebody took a fucking picture.  All right.  We'll move on from this for now and get into some new shit.  Sorry to the listeners, by the way, for this contest that was handled horrendously. 
[01:42:00]  Nah, they'll blame somebody else, though.  It's not their fault.  I want to know who this therapist is that convinced you you're a fucking genius.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Anthony took the day off for his birthday.  He'll be back tomorrow.  We got Rich Voss in the studio helping us out today.  He's going to be at Motley's in Boston over the weekend getting that lobster roll sandwich. 
[01:42:30]  And you're going to do like the Freedom Trail or any of that shit while you're up there?  What's the Freedom Trail?  It's like a little walk.  There's like a line on the street.  You follow the line in it.  And it walks you to all these historical places of Boston.  I couldn't think of anything worse than falling.  If that line takes me to a golf course, that's where I'm going.  That's all you care about.  That's all I do on the road.  I mean, like we go on the road.  Bobby and I go on the road.  We do nothing.  Like we're in some of the best cities. 
[01:43:00]  Like when we were in Philly, we wanted to go see the Liberty Bell.  So we drove to it.  And then we got there.  And we said, you know what?  I don't want to get out of the car.  So we looked at it.  Then we went back online.  It's kind of hard to look at it through a car window.  Quick enough.  We saw the Liberty Bell.  Did you get to see the crack?  Kind of.  Kind of, right?  We saw the crack.  And then we just went back and watched the Info Channel and got info on it.  That is smart.  Everybody would tell us the Info Channel about what's going on in that area.  You know what?  I don't even want to beat you up because I'm not a tourist guy like that. 
[01:43:30]  I mean, I talk about it.  The one tourist thing worth doing is Alcatraz, if you ever get out there.  I did that on my first honeymoon.  Fucking amazing.  Yeah, we did that.  Most of the tourist trap shit is who gives a shit.  Yeah.  I took Saturday, we took DaBaby to Easton to the Crayola factory for the kid.  Like I would never do something like that.  Oh, you got to do stuff for your kids.  But the Crayon factory is only like really one floor of crayons.  And then they just do other shit on the second and third floor of, you know, farming shit. 
[01:44:00]  How does that have anything to do with crayons?  Right, right.  But like we've been, yeah, Alcatraz was great.  Alka?  Alcatraz or whatever the fuck it is.  Where's Jimmy?  Did you say Alka?  Alcatraz.  Alcatraz.  Trash.  Trash.  Alcatraz was good.  Alcatraz.  Like when we, here's what we did, when we went to fucking England.  I don't even know how to say it now because you just fucked me up.  Jimmy.  Wait, hold on.  He just said Alcatraz. 
[01:44:30]  Trash.  Alcatraz.  Alcatraz.  But you said Alcatraz.  I was on that one.  You know what Alcatraz is?  We were talking about Alcatraz.  But he called it Alcatraz.  He doesn't do it either.  He doesn't go to, like when we were in England, in London, Bonnie and I like to, you know, you  can go to this or that.  We were staying right by Buckingham Palace.  We didn't do that.  I've been to Alcatraz, by the way.  Yeah, so have I.  That was the only good one.  And then we didn't even fucking do the tour bus. 
[01:45:00]  We just got on a double-decker bus and drove around and looked at shit.  Yeah, that's fine.  It's fine.  Most tourist stuff sucks.  It really does.  Hey, you know, this is a very good idea.  Maybe Danny can help me out with this one, too, because Tim's going to get it going.  Tim in South Carolina.  Now, just to set it up, Rich, you're going to be in Boston.  There's a lot of fucking history, man, up there.  Yes.  Revolutionary War started up there.  The first shot of the Revolutionary War.  Yes.  A lot of shit going on up there.  Tim, what do you got for Rich?  I was just wondering if maybe he'd like to answer some questions about the Revolutionary War. 
[01:45:30]  Would you like to answer some questions about the Revolutionary War?  Or maybe early American history?  Now you're letting callers program?  Why not?  Why would this be different than any other day?  Can any callers start an email address for us?  It works.  Yeah, I can answer a couple questions if you like.  You got a question?  Sure.  I think they got one right off the top of my head.  What was the name of the church where they hung the lanterns to determine if the British were coming if land or by sea?  First Presbyterian. 
[01:46:00]  Wow.  I don't know.  The church where they hung it?  Mm-hmm.  The first one, St. Chip.  St. Chip.  No, boss.  It was the old north church.  Was it really?  Okay.  How does that make you any money in life?  What's your handicap?  Yeah.  I was just trying to talk to you.  Yeah, they hung it from there.  Okay.  Next to the hemorrhoid. 
[01:46:30]  Okay, another one?  You have another one?  Yeah, one more.  No.  Well, I'm okay.  This guy has one.  He only knows one thing about the Revolutionary War.  We want just basic.  I know shit.  Basic early American history in general would be very, very good.  Who was the name of the American general who betrayed the U.S. Army at Yorktown?  Uh, what?  Yeah.  Yeah, Rich.  Do it again.  I didn't hear it. 
[01:47:00]  I said what?  Because I didn't hear it.  Nah, I'm not going to do that.  He's asking about Benedict Arnold.  Yeah.  No, he isn't.  I know that.  I know that, Dave.  What was Benedict Arnold's role in this whole thing?  Actually.  Coming out with bread.  Yeah.  What?  Arnold's bread.  He invented Arnold's bread.  Do you know Benedict Arnold, what he did?  Yeah, what did he do, Rich?  He's a traitor.  He fucking was a traitor.  But I heard he wasn't.  Is that a big misconception that he was not a traitor?  I heard the Jews didn't kill Jesus. 
[01:47:30]  Who are you going to believe?  Well, they didn't actually.  The Italians did.  The Romans, yeah.  A couple of Jews were like, yeah, get rid of him.  But it was really...  I was...  I want to deal with the contract, by the way.  Uh, this guy's quiz fell flat.  Yeah, it did fall a little flat.  That's okay.  Uh, did you get an answer down the hall there, Jimmy?  Um...  About the email debacle?  Um...  Uh...  Well, Gary...  I'll say this for Gary, too.  He was...  Gary was out for last week, too.  So there's things that last week were beyond his control, because he was on vacation. 
[01:48:00]  But, um...  I don't know.  We should have him come in and just ask the questions.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Didn't he say something about...  I don't want to misquote him.  But he said something about how we have a staff here who has to, like, be on top of that stuff.  Uh, and I said, well, Danny did bring it to somebody's attention.  And...  It didn't happen.  Like...  Wow, the whole staff is running down the hall.  But again, I don't want to misquote Gary, either.  But I...  Believe me, I know the staff's on...  I said, this is one thing these guys know is computers and all that stuff. 
[01:48:30]  I have a lot...  I have a lot more confidence in the staff than the babysitters.  Well, for computers, of course.  Holy shit.  The guys know how to step in email.  Yes, Sam.  Yes, Travis.  Yes, Iraq.  Yes, Steve.  Holy shit.  Well, I mean, just in case anything's brought into question, I have the complete paper trail,  where it was first...  The first email was sent to me and Eric on January 26th.  The contract was sent to Gary.  This is the celebrity apprentice thing?  Yes.  So they gave us paperwork that they needed signed immediately so they could start editing the program 
[01:49:00]  for a future celebrity apprentice, which ended up airing last night, right?  Yes.  On January 26th.  All right.  So you got the paper from NBC January 26th.  Good.  The contract was emailed to Gary.  He had it on January 27th.  Okay.  So it was emailed to him...  Right here.  I emailed and said, here you go.  And he acknowledged that he received it by asking me for a copy of the audio.  Okay.  Okay.  He got both those things on January 27th.  Okay.  I let the person I was working with, an apprentice, know, on February 9th, she asked what's going 
[01:49:30]  on, and he followed up with the lawyers.  Now, you didn't realize...  So February 9th is almost just under two weeks later.  Right.  At this point, I said...  That's a lot of fucking time right there.  On February 9th, I told her what I had been told, that it's about two-thirds of the way  through the lawyers.  I wouldn't have written that if nobody told me that.  Sure.  On February 22nd, which is the same day that the contract is signed and dated, February  22nd, that same day I emailed the person at Celebrity Apprentice saying, the lawyers 
[01:50:00]  put together a release.  I'm faxing it over later today.  And it was faxed.  And then I didn't hear back.  And finally, on March 3rd, she said, yeah, I got it.  So sorry.  I've been swamped.  Everything looks great.  The producers are putting the episode together.  As soon as I know if the clip is being used in the show, I'll get back to you.  And that was it.  So we officially got back to it on February 22nd.  February 22nd.  When you got it on January 26th.  Yes.  That's a month later. 
[01:50:30]  Am I correct?  Yes.  Four weeks.  And I remember having this conversation.  I did say that it was urgent.  That doesn't sound like it.  Because I remember Gary telling me, well, yeah, usually this stuff takes a while, but I am  going to do my best to push it through.  Well, four weeks is a lifetime as far as this situation goes.  I would understand a week.  I would understand maybe a week.  I don't think I would understand more than a week.  More than a week is inexcusable.  Yeah.  But four weeks, I mean, you know, come on.  So I was telling Gary, like, this is what, and again, I don't think, Mel's a guy who 
[01:51:00]  he understands the value, because he was in radio, he understands the value of free  plugs on TV.  He, believe me, knows this business probably better than any of us.  Obviously better than any of us.  I guarantee you he does not know that there's a system in place that is so counterproductive  to doing what the company wants you to do.  It's like, free plug!  How do you blow that?  That should be, as they like to say in the corporate world, on the fast track. 
[01:51:30]  I mean, something like that should be on the fast track.  I understand they can't, you know, jump up every time we need them, because, well, I  think they should, but whatever.  But something like this, it should be on the fast track immediately.  It shouldn't take four weeks.  Especially when, I understand they have stock things they're doing, and that's what the  main lawyers are doing here.  I mean, this is not going to the head lawyer, the fucking lead counsel.  He's doing stock in Washington.  I mean, they're doing bigger shit.  But the lawyers are dealing with this.  There's got to be a lawyer on staff that does this type of thing.  It shouldn't take four weeks. 
[01:52:00]  Why are you trying to steal his UFC hat, Rich?  What is wrong with you?  How did you notice that?  Because I'm not an idiot.  I know two minus one is one.  I know I had one.  We got a box of UFC stuff, and one of the hats is pretty cool.  I got one of them, and Jimmy got one of them, and Rich desperately wants it.  I'm obsessed.  Now I'm trying to steal.  I'm taking my head off it.  My mind off it.  Now he's trying to steal Jimmy.  All right, well, there you go.  Great.  I don't know. 
[01:52:30]  They can say whatever they want, but four weeks is just way too long.  I knew that it was not our staff that dropped the ball on that.  That's something you get back to them immediately, because that's an incredible opportunity.  It is inexcusable.  That literally, if Sam sent that out the 27th, I understand it takes a couple days with a weekend or something.  By February 9th, she should have said, hey, thanks.  Got it last week.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  February 27th was, I mean, January 27th was a Wednesday.  Yeah, that's... 
[01:53:00]  It's okay.  The following Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, even.  And that's one of those things, and I don't know if they have the skill set, but they should be basically hounding the lawyers every day going, wow, you know, this is a timing issue.  We really need an answer.  I know you're busy, but you really got to get back to us, because, you know, we're going to miss out on this.  It's an unbelievable opportunity for the opening.  Understandable, but you know what?  The lawyers shouldn't need to be told that.  Wow, fuck.  Like, anyone working for the company...  That's asking for way too much, Jimmy.  Anyone working for a satellite radio company shouldn't need to be told the value of a plug on the celebrity apprentice. 
[01:53:30]  I don't think anybody should need to be told that.  And I did act with urgency, because I have contracts from all three of the hosts that were signed the day after they were sent.  Of course they were.  No, we should have just jerked off for a couple weeks with the contract.  We should have wrapped our dicks in them and said, yeah, let's just wait.  And here's our responsibility in the whole thing.  Usually when we get any type of contract, we're skittish and scared, and we call up Super Agent Bob Eadman, like, hey, you got to look this over, make sure it's cool. 
[01:54:00]  But we knew how important this was and how great it was for the show.  I just fucking signed away without ever talking to Bob.  I'm like, look, we got to...  Yes, I'll sign this.  What, you giving it back to them today?  And Sam goes, yeah.  I'm like, yeah, let's push this forward.  So it was absolutely the ball was dropped here.  And the big boss should be made aware of it.  He will.  Because there's no way he can't possibly know it.  He's got a million things to do.  He should know that, to know that there are people that work here.  He will.  I mean, you know, he might say, look, you're wasting my time, but at least I'll fucking make sure he knows. 
[01:54:30]  A plug in front of seven million people?  That's a massive fucking plug.  That would be terrific.  I apologize to the listeners for harping on it.  But it's really frustrating because our success rate is judged on stuff like this and on recognition and on subs and on people that, you know, subscribe to us from Sirius to the best of their...  And it's like when things are done to hurt that, nobody during negotiation time will go, wow, we fucked you here, here, and here.  Never.  They're only going to look at numbers. 
[01:55:00]  So I apologize to the listeners.  All right.  Thank you, Sam.  There's the paper trail.  Cool.  I knew he, of course.  There's the paper trail.  That's a long time between January 26th, getting the paperwork from NBC and pushing it back to him on February 22nd.  That's a red flag.  And Sam sent it out the day he got it or the day after, right?  The next day it was out.  The next day it was one of the guys that...  February 22nd, the same day that it was signed, it was faxed.  January. 
[01:55:30]  No.  Oh, no.  He got it January 26th.  In the afternoon, January 26th.  January 26th, they got it the morning of January 26th.  The first thing, the next day.  Right.  And you probably sent it to the 26th, but it didn't get open until the 27th.  Right.  Well, no, because I wasn't going to give it to them without having you guys sign first.  Oh, okay.  So I had you guys sign.  Yeah, so we signed, like, the next day.  But it was the 27th.  I was hoping to see it.  So I knew that it wasn't on the end of this staff.  Well, I want to thank the babysitters for, you know, fucking up a terrific opportunity for the show.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Cool. 
[01:56:00]  All right.  Hey, homeless man stabbed dozens.  He was stabbed.  Dozens of people walk by him as he dies doing nothing.  And he was going to help a lady that was getting mugged.  A lady was getting mugged.  Very good, Rich.  Homeless guy jumped into action and saved the lady from being mugged, right?  He gets fucking stabbed, this homeless guy.  How many attackers?  He's down.  One guy.  I got the news story here.  Okay.  He's down, and he's obviously bleeding out, and people just fucking walked by the homeless guy bleeding out. 
[01:56:30]  The video is online and everything, man.  Where's this?  In Queens, right?  Queens, yeah.  Nobody called 911?  Not only that, one guy went over him and took a picture of him with his fucking phone.  People with cell phones who just take pictures of victims should be shot in the fucking temple.  Right.  It was one week ago that Hugo Alfredo Talyak saw a woman being accosted by a man at 144th Street in Jamaica.  Talyak, 31 years old and homeless, decided to intervene.  The woman got away. 
[01:57:00]  He got stabbed in the chest.  Surveillance video shows Talyak go after his attacker for a few steps before falling to the pavement.  And here's the truly shocking part.  Nearly two dozen people walked past him on the ground, bleeding to death.  One person stopped and took out his cell phone, but instead of calling for help, he snapped a photo of the scene.  Another passerby shook Talyak's and even tried to turn him over, but walked off despite the pool of blood under his body.  It wasn't until 7.23 a.m., over an hour and 20 minutes after the stabbing, that help arrived. 
[01:57:30]  A group of firefighters responding to a 911 call about an injured man spotted Talyak's on the ground, but he had already died.  Detectives say it's not too late for someone to help.  In last week's case, they're hoping someone will see the surveillance video and recognize either the woman who was attacked or, even better, the man who killed Hugo Talyak's.  Jeez.  And the lady...  What a horrible country.  Why wouldn't the fucking lady, at least, you know, she's probably running and scared. 
[01:58:00]  Maybe she had no idea this happened.  She might have just...  I don't know.  Maybe she ran off because she was free.  But where do you go for that?  Could people see that he was bleeding, though?  Like, because you're used to, in New York, seeing guys sleep on the street.  That's not uncommon.  Sleep like that, face down, in the open, almost in the middle of the sidewalk?  Yeah.  Just off the middle of the sidewalk?  It's...  I...  Look, I've been in New York now, off and out for 10 years.  I've never seen a homeless guy sleeping like that.  I would have...  I would have absolutely called 911 if I saw a guy laying like that. 
[01:58:30]  Absolutely.  I mean, you're right.  You see him sleeping in the doorways and this and that.  You're like, ah, that's just a crazy person.  But that is an obvious problem.  Right in front of your eyes.  Fuck.  It's just fucking animals.  Huh?  Yeah.  Fucking animals.  Yeah, Rich.  You're right.  It's just...  You're right.  When...  You got your tech gadgets?  I know all my tech gadgets. 
[01:59:00]  Okay.  What do you got?  And fucking, uh...  Oh, look at that.  Rats.  Oh.  What?  Fucking rats.  Yeah.  We haven't gotten rat watching in a while.  I know.  In years.  Yeah, I miss the rat watching stories.  You guys used to, what, coming home from the clubs late at night?  Yeah, just go get candies and feed them and they'd all come running to the car, scurrying  out.  How many would you see?  Oh, fucking 50, 40.  I don't know.  Really?  Sure, late at night, up on 72nd, but not on the subway stage.  Yeah, it's nice.  And they would just come... 
[01:59:30]  And there's other places to go, but this one...  What, all you'd have to do is throw a little piece of candy and they would come out?  Yeah, they'd come...  Because they...  You know how they have those little islands with all the flowers and all...  Yeah, yeah.  Those...  They're all in there.  Yeah, they're fucking...  You gotta be insane to go in there.  Or sit on one of those benches by there.  Oh, yeah.  You gotta be insane.  I don't even walk through...  For the people that aren't from New York, they're in between...  How do you explain it?  I guess in between the streets or whatever.  Like Broadway.  It's a tiny little island.  So you got traffic going this way, you got traffic coming at you, and in the middle is 
[02:00:00]  like a little...  Like a mini...  It's not even a park.  It's just like shrubbery.  Yeah.  And a couple trees and...  Yeah.  Just full of rats.  And you see them scurrying in there.  Just full of fucking rats.  And you'd pull up.  We would pull up and throw Reese's Pieces and stuff like that.  And they fucking loved chocolate.  And they'd come out like fucking...  Tons of them.  It was fun, man.  My brother used to...  He used to live up on the east side in the hundreds. 
[02:00:30]  And he had a horrible apartment.  And he used to do battle with the rats in his apartment all the time with fucking frying  pans and shit.  I should get him on the show to talk.  I mean, it's great stories.  They would be...  They would go out when they were younger, you know, and get all drunk and shit and then  come home and they're just hammered and they're passing out.  And rats are just walking all around the place.  In their fucking house.  Oh, fuck yeah.  And they would hear rattling in the kitchen.  So they think maybe someone broke in or something's going on.  They go in there and they would do battle with the rats with fucking frying pans. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, fuck.  My brother way braver than me.  I would...  I'd move.  I would be like, get up.  He didn't give a shit.  He just knew he was living among rats.  And every once in a while, he would have to take them out.  You'd freak out.  Oh, I would lose my fucking mind.  I picked up a girl once after the bar years ago.  We went back to my place to do...  You know, I had Coke and she was hot and we're sitting in the living room.  And I lived up in the fucking third floor.  And we're sitting in the living room, didn't really do Coke.  I'm going to fucking...  You had some more bacon.  And a fucking...  A bat flew.  And I got up and I pushed her out of the way and I ran out of my own house. 
[02:01:30]  Okay.  I pushed her.  Like, get the fuck away from me.  And I went back like two days later and the bat was dead, you know, from something.  You know what?  I had a...  I did Coke.  I had a bat problem in my old place in Huntington.  And I think I would have to say bats more creepy than rats.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Fucking creepy as shit. 
[02:02:00]  But I was so high.  It didn't matter.  You know what?  I slept on...  Well, I spent a lot of nights sleeping on the couch back then.  But I slept on the couch one night and I felt like something was hovering above me.  And I'm like, that's crazy.  You're fucking nuts, man.  There's nothing above your head, right?  I just had this feeling.  So I slept the whole night.  And these bats, they will circle for hours.  Sure enough, I wake up in the morning and now because it's light...  Now because it's light out, the bat is just hanging in the corner of the room. 
[02:02:30]  I'm like, that was a fucking bat hovering all night just circling above my fucking head.  I would have been freaked out that it bit me or something.  And you know those fuckers have serious babies.  They don't bother you, though.  Bats don't really bother you.  How do you know what's on a bat's fucking mind?  No, bats don't.  They don't.  No, they don't bother you.  They don't attack people.  Just how they fly, though, is what...  Because you can't figure out what their pattern is.  But we had another bat in the kitchen, Rich.  I took out the fire extinguisher and it was one of those powder ones. 
[02:03:00]  The powder ones.  And I completely destroyed my kitchen trying to fucking knock this bat out of the air.  It's like a fucking sitcom.  I was so hot.  You wouldn't pet a bat?  How fucking...  I don't want to pet a bat?  I don't want to touch my wife.  I wouldn't...  You would pet a bat?  Sure.  If I knew it didn't have rape, you have to be careful they're not rabid.  But I mean, if it was one that was brought in by a handler...  Yeah, if it was controlled, but wouldn't you...  Not even...  Are you crazy?  How about if there was a bat in studio, would you go up to... 
[02:03:30]  No, no, no.  Just kidding, again, they do have diseases.  Look at the fucking size of his dick.  I didn't know bats have dick.  Bats have...  Yeah, I know.  Fucking...  Would you suck a bat cock?  Jesus.  For bat rock?  Look at that.  His big bat balls.  Oh!  That's...  Oh, dude, we gotta...  We gotta fucking caption contest that shit.  Look at that.  Can you send me that picture somehow?  Yeah, we gotta caption contest this.  Even the black bats have big dicks.  You gotta see those bats dicking balls, man.  His bag is huge.  Pretty fucking impressive.  Holy fuck. 
[02:04:00]  I thought that was quarantine.  That's thin, though.  He's got no girth.  This bat has a bigger dick than Bobo.  Dude, his fucking...  He must rip up bat pussy with that.  He fucking goes through bat pussy.  His dick is literally...  He fucking destroys bat pussy.  That's the equivalent of a human being like a 14-inch dick.  Right, what?  Now I understand why the bats are just fucking going in circles all...  They're all over the place.  Their pussy's hurting.  They're trying to air him out.  I don't know.  We were walking...  We were walking home from a club one night, me and Bodhi, from the club to the hotel.  Yeah.  Just walking across... 
[02:04:30]  And there was bats just hovering all over us.  Oh, yeah.  She got pushed.  I ran.  Oh, yeah.  They didn't bother you, did they?  Huh?  They don't bother you, dude.  No, that's...  No, but you don't know.  No, they're not going to fucking bother you.  Their radar is so good.  They know the difference between you and a fucking...  I mean, an insect.  I mean, intellectually, they wouldn't spot the difference.  But between you and a fucking...  They know you're not a bug.  What's that story?  What's that old tale that they try to nest in your hair?  No, they did tests on that where they put a bat in a girl's hair and they mixed it up.  The bat just flew out.  Yeah, it didn't want to deal with it.  What are you talking about, Rich? 
[02:05:00]  It was an old tale that...  How is it going to nest in your hair?  Do you realize that takes time?  You're not going to notice that a bat is starting to make a nest in your hair?  You ever see a hornet?  All of a sudden, your ear is so you realize, oh, hornets have built a nest here.  Look at those fucking things.  We were playing...  Last week, we were playing golf in Ocean City.  The other guy was...  Oh, who the fuck?  You want a bat biologist?  I don't feel like listening to you right now.  What?  The guy I was playing golf with the other day in fucking Ocean City hit the ball.  He hit the ball, like, not in the woods, but in the, like, rough air. 
[02:05:30]  We walked in there.  There was a snake.  The fucking size.  This big.  And I just...  I pushed him and I fucking ran so fast.  You scared of snakes?  I'm scared of everything.  Are you kidding me?  Mice.  Snakes.  Any of that.  You know what scared the shit out of me?  Was I playing with you?  Trying to think.  I have to pee.  You have to pee.  All right, go.  Oh, it wasn't you.  Okay, I was in Florida.  And my drive fucking...  Well, you've seen my drive, so you can imagine where it was. 
[02:06:00]  So I'm going, walking toward my ball, and it was my friend Ted.  Okay, he used to work for the Islanders, now works for NASCAR.  We were down in Florida because the Islanders, I think, made the fucking playoffs, whatever.  This is a few years ago now.  And I'm walking toward my ball off the fairway, and all of a sudden he goes, stop.  I'm like, why?  I'm like, no.  And I keep walking.  He goes, no, trust me, stop.  And I turn.  There's a fucking alligator.  Maybe 10 feet from my fucking ball.  Get the fuck.  This course was filled with them.  Like, it was a lot of water holes, and you can see the bubbles of the alligators. 
[02:06:30]  A lot of them were very small, but this one, this one was probably like a six-footer.  I've seen some big ones in Florida, and there could be...  Right off the fairway, just fucking sunning itself.  And then the locals are like, ah, they don't bother you.  I'm like, oh, really?  All right, I'll go find my ball because it's really worth hitting that right now.  Yeah, it's bad enough I've got to take a penalty stroke, and now I've got to lose my leg.  Yeah.  Okay, I've seen those big fucking alligators.  Get in the cart, and you scram, you know?  But bats, rats, any of that shit, you don't want to fuck with that. 
[02:07:00]  Let me say hi to...  I don't know.  Fuck.  A lot of fucking...  Let's go to Jason in Delaware.  Jason, you're a bat biologist?  Yes, sir.  Now, Rich wants to know if a bat could fucking nest in your hair.  No, they will not nest in your hair.  Of course not.  No, I know that, but...  What do you want to ask the bat biologist?  For real, how do you know they won't just swoop down and bite you for the fuck of it?  Like, I mean, you don't know...  They can't eat you, so why would they?  They can't what?  They're interested in food. 
[02:07:30]  They won't, you know...  They're not going to...  They don't give a shit about you.  Okay, how about there's a fly on there?  How about a fly lands on you, and a bat swoops down?  Boom.  You know what I mean?  How about this, bat biologist?  What would it take for a bat to bite you?  If it did have rabies, there's a chance that it might.  Oh, that's true.  Because it is a neurological disorder, and it does interrupt natural processes, but...  Right.  Instances of rabies in bats is very low.  More people die from dog bites than rabies in bats. 
[02:08:00]  Is this a dumb question?  What if it feels kind of like it's trapped, and it's got to go through you to get out of  that area?  Would it bite you?  If you grab it, it'll bite you.  Nah, yeah.  For the most part, bats aren't going to touch you.  Even though, you know what?  If there was a bat flying in the studio right now, we'd all fucking run like sissies.  Like in a second?  In a second.  Yeah.  I've been bit hundreds of times because I'm holding them, but they don't...  It doesn't even hurt.  Do you fly around at night?  No, I do not fly around at night. 
[02:08:30]  Wait a second.  You catch them, and we...  Yeah, when we're processed, we'll go bite you sometimes.  You've been bit, and...  All right, Jason.  How do you got to check...  Like, someone said to check if a dog has rabies, they have to kill the dog.  Is that true?  Huh?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  What's the question?  Okay.  How would you know if a bat has rabies?  Like, if you've been bit so many times, every time you get bit, you have to check to see  if that bat has rabies, right?  Well, you wouldn't.  There's some...  There's some behavioral differences that, you know, I might notice, but chances are you 
[02:09:00]  wouldn't tell, but a bat will only live for about 24 hours after it gets rabies.  Okay.  Yeah, but you're not going to find the bat if it bites your wrist.  Yeah, I mean, if it bites you...  No, I'm saying he...  You're going to follow the bat?  No, I'm saying he's been bit a bunch of times.  Right.  Yeah, how do you know you didn't have rabies, Jason?  Well, I have a pre-closure vaccine for rabies.  Oh, I got you.  I figured it was.  What do you mean?  You can get something that if you get a vaccine, you can never get rabies?  I guess.  Yeah.  As far as bats biting you. 
[02:09:30]  So, all right.  Thank you, Jason.  I'm going to get that shot.  Hey, have a good one.  I was playing golf with you with the rabid raccoon that was following us, right?  Yes.  How fucking scary was that?  They're just...  They're big...  They're disgusting.  Remember, I pulled out my stupid HD flip, and I'm trying to get too close.  It's like 12 feet in a tree, and the thing jumps out of the tree.  It's fucking...  Are you kidding me?  A raccoon attacking you?  And then it was going through the golf bags of the guys behind us, waiting on the tee.  Trying to get food.  The one guy has no idea.  He's just on his cell phone with his legs up on the cart, and this raccoon is completely 
[02:10:00]  going through his bag right behind him, looking for food.  They're always...  I always see them in the dumpster behind my house.  I saw a whole family one day walking, like...  It was about their mother and father, and there was like five little raccoons behind them,  and they were climbing up a wall.  They're fucking disgusting.  Yeah.  Rats?  Now we're talking about raccoons and bats.  Possums.  All of them.  They're just fucking possums.  Oh.  Brian Affiliate.  I had a bat flying around my apartment.  My cat killed it.  I've been bitten by a bat.  You want to talk to that guy? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Doug in Ohio.  Doug!  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I'm a truck driver.  Yeah, I was working one night, and you got to have a hard hat, and I was up on the deck  of the slab bed, securing the load, went to adjust my hard hat, and when I put it back  on, the damn bat had been right there and got it trapped right between my hard hat, and  it bit me right in the damn head, right on top of the head, and wound up with over a  series of over 20 shots in order to get rid of whatever it was that had happened to me 
[02:11:00]  from it, and those shots were just nasty.  They would just make you drain all the energy out of you, you know, every other couple of  days.  Well, what did the bat have?  It was a precautionary test thing in case it was rabid.  They didn't know, you know.  Well, they knew it wasn't a rabid, sir.  It wasn't rabid, but I still had to.  The protocol was, and the company that I worked for made me go to the hospital and take these 
[02:11:30]  shots and all this other stuff, the insurance reasons for it, because it was on someone else's  property.  In your stomach, those big rabies shots in your stomach?  Yeah, some of them were in your stomach, and some of them were in your, like, hip.  They were nasty.  You would take those shots, and it would just absolutely drain the energy out of you and  make you sick sometimes, and, you know, all I wanted to do was go down and then just lay  down, you know, whenever I would take those damn things for a couple of hours. 
[02:12:00]  Jesus.  Just made it tough to work for several weeks.  I just felt like I had no energy whatsoever.  Whatever it was they were giving me, you know, it was just nasty medicine.  Yeah, I guess you don't want to be bit by a bat.  Thank you.  No, you don't.  Thank you, Doug.  Yeah.  All right.  This guy has a caveman, Brooklyn.  You really have a pet rat?  Yes, I do.  His name is Fifo.  Is it a city rat? 
[02:12:30]  No, it's one from the store.  It was being sold for snake food.  Snake food.  Oh, yeah.  I rescued it.  Well...  It's a little thing.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  It's nice and cuddly.  You can hold it.  It goes on your shoulder.  It nibbles at your finger.  Oh, it's just appreciative that you saved him from a fucking snake.  Yeah, but he doesn't know you as his pet owner.  I would be more impressed if it was a city rat that he's seen in the subway. 
[02:13:00]  He has the biggest set of balls you ever saw.  Really?  Oh, my God.  If it was a track rabbit.  Would you eat rat balls, Rich?  If they were cooked nice?  You know, they eat rats, the mole people that live underground.  Mole people don't eat rats?  They're called track rabbits.  I know they're called track rabbits.  I was obsessed with mole people for a while.  Did you read the book, Mole People?  Did you see the documentary, the black and white documentary that was in, like, two theaters  in the middle of a fucking horrible area of Manhattan because no one gave a shit about 
[02:13:30]  the documentary on mole people?  I went.  Yeah.  They said something like there's thousands and thousands of people that live below the  streets of New York at any given time.  They have fucking cities and mayors.  They don't have cities.  Jimmy, will you help me over here?  Not cities.  They have.  What are you talking about?  It's like 50 of them that live together.  They don't have cities and mayors.  Yes, they do.  They vote in people that fucking run that area.  There might be 50 homeless people under the city in one area.  And they have a city?  What's the city called?  No, not a city. 
[02:14:00]  They don't build fucking sky.  I'm saying they have communities.  They have skyscrapers under the ground?  They have communities.  Communities.  And they vote in officials.  Yes.  To take control.  They have, like, a Mayor Bloomberg?  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  Do they raise sea monkeys, too?  Yes.  What the fuck is that?  You don't even know what a sea monkey is?  Huh?  What?  You don't even know what sea monkeys are?  I can't say it on the air.  No.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I know those two terms are kind of weird to go together. 
[02:14:30]  I know.  I get it, Rich, but sea monkeys was a real thing.  You raised them when you were a kid.  Oh, those things you add water to and they grow?  Yeah.  You know, they're brine shrimp, but they didn't want to tell you that.  Because who would fucking buy brine shrimp?  No, they're sea monkeys.  I just put it out because Vazza said that the mole people have, like, cities and mayors and stuff.  And I always love the packaging of sea monkeys.  Like, they would show, like, a king, a queen, a big castle behind them and stuff.  It's just like, no, they didn't have that.  They had communities down there. 
[02:15:00]  You said cities and mayors.  Well, you know.  Yeah.  No, they have communities and they vote.  And they probably do eat rats.  We cooked up a New York City rat at NAW.  And honestly, the people we brought in to try the rat, they actually went back for seconds.  They ate?  Do you have people eat it?  They ate?  We wouldn't be able to do that nowadays.  These lawyers would have a fit if we said we were going to fucking cook up a subway rat.  It would take eight months to get back to the rat's attorneys.  Yeah.  They would have a fit if we said, look, we're going to get a New York City rat and we're going to fucking cook it. 
[02:15:30]  We're going to have listeners come in and try it.  There's no fucking way they would like that.  What about the 50-gallon Trump thing?  No fucking way they would like that.  What's wrong with that?  It's entertaining.  Well, you can't put something.  You checked out a little bit there.  Mole people underground.  He's saying there's cities and mayors.  I'm listening to them.  There's communities.  Not communities.  You can call them the city or whatever.  I don't know what they do down there.  I'm sure they have in their own way some kind of structure.  I'm sure.  Yeah.  So then what?  I'm sure they kind of like, you know. 
[02:16:00]  So then why are you making fun of me when I'm telling you?  Because you say cities and mayors.  Communities.  Communities.  They vote in.  Like there's a transit system and there's a mayor.  You know how they tap in for the electrical?  I know.  The water's coming through the pipes.  Well, they break the pipe.  Yeah.  They break the pipe just enough so they plug it up.  But then when it's time for a shower, they unplug it.  I know all this stuff.  I saw the documentary.  I guess I read the book.  Yeah.  I don't remember anymore.  I would assume it has to be.  There are like six stories on the ground, some of them.  Yeah, some of them are.  Six stories on the ground. 
[02:16:30]  How do they?  Was there a documentary or video?  I want to see it.  Yeah.  It's called The Mold Fellas?  The Mold People.  This is many years ago, but I think it's just called Mold People, I think.  Yeah, Mold People.  It's about people with a bunch of moles.  I'll do this all day.  And a lot of them just come up through the fucking, you know, manholes and they work all day.  And then there used to be a few spots in New York where people would go and hang out at the end of the day because they would take the mole, the manhole cover off and go back underground.  And you could check them out certain times of day where they're going back underground. 
[02:17:00]  And some of them like were.  Oh, there it is.  The Mold People.  Life in the Tunnel Beneath New York City.  Yeah, that's the book I read.  Yeah.  And what do you call it?  Some of them were just normal people with normal jobs and they just fucking checked out.  I mean, how normal can you be?  Normal people with normal jobs.  Yes.  They weren't all homeless and crazy.  I mean, they're not all crazy.  Are they still normal people with normal jobs, but they live underground?  Or they used to be normal people with normal jobs and now they live underground because they went nuts? 
[02:17:30]  Some just checked out.  They didn't want to deal with above ground.  That's why they went under.  You know, some people deal with things different than others.  It doesn't make them crazy.  Just because you don't agree with them or whatever doesn't make them crazy.  If you live underground, you're crazy.  Oh, really?  And they're going, if you live above ground, you're crazy.  I understand they're saying that, but I'll take my definition of crazy over somebody who has to go to a manhole cover. 
[02:18:00]  You don't see them for an hour on the phone arguing with Tom Warner.  I don't know who Tom Warner is.  He's a guy that started a business.  He's enraging at times, isn't he?  Because he tries to make a point and he just doesn't.  I make a great point.  You don't.  You can't make a great point if you say Tom Warner.  Listen, it's early.  If you meet some mole people, I guarantee there's some there that you wouldn't even know are mole people.  They're just...  You want to come over?  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  Go to 43rd Street and then lift the cover up.  Right.  Come underground.  Some of them have families down there.  Huh?  Some of them have families.  Let's go to Kurt in Cleveland.  Kurt.  Hey, guys.  Before I talk about what I called about, I wanted to plug Rich's gig this weekend at Giggles in Mole City.  Two performances on Friday.  What's that, dude?  Giggles in Mole City.  What did he hear?  Hey, I wanted to see if you guys saw the video.  I think it was last year.  Mono Ginobili.  Yes.  Sweating like that out of the air. 
[02:19:00]  So if you guys need some assistance in the studio, I think he can help you.  I believe he had to get rabies shots because of it.  What did he do?  What did he do?  Who was Mono?  He was Mono Ginobili from the Spurs.  He was dribbling up the court.  A bat was flying around the arena and it came by him.  He just like swiped it out of midair and like knocked it.  I think he knocked it like unconscious or something.  Layed on the ground.  And he scooped it up and continued the game.  Wow, really?  Is there video of this?  It's on YouTube.  All right, hold on a sec.  Bat delayed during a Kings versus Spurs game. 
[02:19:30]  Hold on one second here.  I never heard of this one.  By the way, LeBron James looked great yesterday for you guys.  Yeah, he played really well.  They need to get to game five on Tuesday.  You got to get rid of the Bulls.  What are you guys doing?  You shouldn't allow them to win a game.  It was 20 and they almost pulled it off, so.  Yeah, I don't know.  Bat, we can't get it, Dan.  We're working.  Hold on.  Danny's working on the video.  All right, here we go.  Jimmy, watch this.  Where's the fucking bat? 
[02:20:00]  There's that right there.  All right, so the bat's just flying away.  When did someone hit it?  There's the bat flying.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Flying.  They're trying to grab it with a net.  They got the fucking mascot out there with the net.  Trying to get the bat.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, he picked it up.  He's insane.  And he took him up to a contest.  Why would you pick it up?  Dude, we are a bunch of pussies.  He picked it up.  What's his name? 
[02:20:30]  Kurt, I really don't know who he is.  Mono Ginobili.  All right, so it's a bad delay.  Oh, he's probably like a fucking Armenian or something, a Russian.  He probably fucking eats it as an appetizer in a restaurant or something.  He's fucking.  All right, so hold on.  The game is delayed.  They see the bat.  They get the stupid mascot out with the big net to make it entertaining for everybody.  And then the bat was close enough to him, and he just swatted it with his left hand,  knocking it out cold on the ground.  And then he just walks up to it and picks it up like it's nothing.  And hands it to a guy.  And hands it to another guy that brings it to the locker room. 
[02:21:00]  And fucks it.  What the fuck?  I've never seen that before, and I've never heard about that.  Okay, see how that was.  Dan, where's that link for everybody?  It's on YouTube.  I will get it to you so you can tweet it.  Yeah, I'll tweet it.  But it's bat delay during a Kings-Spurs game.  I'll tweet it.  If I was in a stand four levels up, I would have ran out.  Well, he's a tough guy.  He broke his nose, I think, in the last game and wouldn't wear a mask last night.  So he had his nose all taped up and everything. 
[02:21:30]  I don't know a little too much about this guy.  Exactly.  You want to suck his cock and balls and ass?  He's obviously an NBA fan.  He's following LeBron.  You know LeBron's leaving Cleveland, right?  No, he's not.  Come on, no.  I can feel it.  I think he's leaving.  Especially if you guys win the championship, then there's no real reason for him to stick around.  Is he going to be like every store on Euclid Avenue?  Huh?  We haven't won a title in 40 years.  Well, I'm saying if he wins it, then why would he stay?  If he doesn't win it, then I can see where he maybe stays and gives you guys a championship.  There's so much to do here. 
[02:22:00]  Where it's pouring outside.  This is just basic sports talk.  I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, but I think he really wants to play for the Knicks.  I really do.  I think he wants to be a big star in a big city.  How many games did the Nets end up winning this year?  11, maybe?  How many did the Nets end up winning, Kurt?  I think they won 11.  Yeah, I think that's about right.  All right, brother.  Thanks.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Yeah, right on.  Goodbye.  Oh, fuck this bitch.  Hi, Lydia. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, hi, Opie.  I knew you were talking about me.  No, no, no, I wasn't.  There was someone on TV.  What do you got, Lydia?  Hi, Lydia.  Yeah, you were talking about rats before.  I grew up in Brooklyn, and one of the things that would often happen, unfortunately, we  would go on dates, me and my girlfriends, and occasionally the guys would go down to  the garbage docks down by the Verrazano, this big garbage transfer station there.  And what was fun for a lot of the guys we dated was to take baseball bats and go and bash 
[02:23:00]  the rats in the head.  And there were literally thousands of them.  And then once, unfortunately, it was a put out or get out situation.  And man, we were not getting out.  That's when they took you on dates to go smash fucking rats with bats?  Yeah, fun in Brooklyn.  And you went back out with them?  You know what?  I read a book on rats, too. 
[02:23:30]  That book was good, but you got to kind of, there's too much fucking details and information.  I think it's just called Rats, and it's a whole history of rats and how they got to  New York City and stuff.  They came in on the ships and whatnot.  And it's a great book.  But it's a little wordy at times.  You know, you rifle through it.  I did.  I did the same thing on a date.  I was going on with this girl years ago.  You know, and she was in New York.  I met her at a comedy club.  And then we fooled around.  And I took her out one night. 
[02:24:00]  And at first, I took her to a sex club because I had free passes.  Remember when that guy gave us free passes at the cellar to the vault?  Vaguely, yeah.  He gave us.  So I took her there.  But they moved the vault, and it was like in somebody's apartment almost.  It went from that big club.  I remember we tried to go there.  Yeah.  And then I took this girl there.  So this was our date.  And I take her there.  And then we watched, like, this couple, you know, one guy's jerking off in the corner,  this and that.  And I take her from there to look at rats.  Was the vault empty?  Not as empty as my fucking soul. 
[02:24:30]  But it was a couple creepy guys.  You brought a date to a sex club?  Oh, yeah.  She didn't know New York.  And the guy's just jerking off in there?  Yeah, those guys jerking off.  I didn't get to really see him.  And then he said, all right, well, let's go watch rats now.  Let's go watch rats.  Did he get anything off her?  Yeah.  And her...  Yeah.  That's pretty impressive.  Herpes.  God, she's got low self-esteem.  No, it was a fun night out.  What the fuck?  Her friend was going out with, like, the richest guy.  Actually, you know what? 
[02:25:00]  I wouldn't mind checking out rats.  That would be cool.  Where do we go to check out rats?  I don't know now.  Me and Rich tried to go to...  Sorry.  What's wrong, Rich?  He's just trying to touch me.  Me and Rich went through...  Mitch doesn't like his fucking ankles touched.  Why?  I don't like anything from your warm fucking kids' fingers touching me.  My hands are very clean.  Why don't you like being touched, Rich?  Who likes it?  It's ridiculous.  It's just...  People...  You know, if I knew how to...  If I liked it...  Can you hug another man?  Huh?  Can you hug another man?  24 years ago.  Yes.  Boston hugged a man's ass with his cock in his mouth. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  Let's say it.  Thank you, Lydia.  Let's go to Dan in New Hampshire.  Dan.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  I had...  I came out to my house.  I live in the mountains up in New Hampshire, about 90 miles from the Canadian border.  And I went out.  I left some Dunkin' Donuts in the backseat of my Explorer.  And I came out, and there was a bear.  Punched a hole through the window.  Climbed in the backseat.  Ate my donuts.  And then fell asleep.  So I had to call the cops, and they had to come and put mace on them, and take them 
[02:26:00]  out, and...  Jesus.  You know, get them out of my car, and then I had bear shit, and smell and vaccine in my  car.  Did the bear shit in your fucking car?  What a dick.  What a fucking...  What a fucking asshole.  I know.  Bears are douchebags.  We've proven that already.  How bad was the bear's shit?  Well, he tore...  He clawed the seats, and he just...  It was like a green...  Just a wasted shit.  It's kind of like Jimmy shitting on a Friday night.  He's probably the donuts.  Bears aren't used to eating fucking processed donuts.  They're used to, like, fresh berries.  And fresh meat.  They're not used to...  Yeah, they're not used to a fucking Boston cream. 
[02:26:30]  Unlike you.  What do you mean?  Did you see what bears attacked?  Nothing on that.  All right, Dan.  Thank you so much, sir.  Did you see what bears attacked?  It was just on the Discovery Channel.  I didn't see it.  No.  No.  What was that about?  You can't fuck with them.  Nor do I wish to hear about it.  You can't fuck with them.  Who does?  Why would you fuck with a bear?  Who slaps a bear in the face?  There's bear people.  You're supposed to play dead, but who in their right mind is going to attempt that one? 
[02:27:00]  Every one of us is going to go, fuck that, I'm running.  You play dead.  They say you're supposed to play dead.  I think if you just ran around a tree in circles, eventually one of you are going to give up.  You can't climb the tree.  Just keep running around it.  I kind of like your strategy.  I think I would rather run around a tree than play dead.  Yeah, really.  I'd rather take my luck running around a tree.  That's what I would do.  But the bear can't really figure out what the fuck's going on.  Oh, fuck.  But the bear would just stand there and wait to get to the other side of the tree because  you would assume it's trying to chase you around the tree. 
[02:27:30]  The bear's not that fucking smart.  The bear doesn't know psychology.  All right.  That's why I won't go camping, man.  I got a lot of camping gear, but I'm too scared to go camping because of fucking bears  and ticks, the smallest thing on the planet and the biggest thing.  Yeah, I used to go camping when I lived in Boston.  It's not for me.  My daughter has camping.  It sucks.  It's creepy when it gets dark out there.  I don't give a shit who you are.  Yeah, I got all this camping equipment from Marble Miles from years ago. 
[02:28:00]  What the fuck?  It's creepy.  We used to go camping.  It's creepy, especially when you don't do drive-by camping, when you really go hiking  in the woods and then find a spot.  Fuck that.  I was out of my mind all night.  Did you guys ever see the Blair Witch Project?  No.  I know a girl that was camping and they were sitting there and there was a thunderstorm  and lightning hit a tree and it went through the root into her leg and they had to run  down the mountain for her and all that shit, you know, and her leg was all black and smoked  out and fucked up.  You know, that fucks up a camping trip. 
[02:28:30]  You think?  I would have cooked something on it.  Let's say hi to Mason in West Virginia.  Mason.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  Jimmy, happy birthday.  Thank you, Mason.  I'm going to throw the hillbillies under the bus here today.  We used to have almost like a bowling league in the late 70s and early 80s.  The landfills in our area wanted to sell some of their property to put a strip mall in and  they would offer 50 cents per rat. 
[02:29:00]  Well, the hillbillies got their 12 gauges and 22s and went out and they would kill them,  bring them in.  The developer now has about six restaurants on this property and they really, the boys  got in behind it and they would come out every Saturday, Saturday night.  Some would shoot bats, most would shoot rats.  And there was kills of 200, 250 per night.  Jesus.  That's a lot of fun.  So that kind of tells you, I don't know what they ever did with them, but I'm sure that  some of the Chinese restaurants around there took advantage. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, the poor Chinese restaurants.  Well, I think I...  I wouldn't have eaten one.  What, in a Chinese restaurant?  What's wrong with you?  Not a million fucking years.  You've never eaten in a Chinese restaurant?  You've got to know where to go.  Nowhere.  There was a place...  Amen.  There was a place...  Thank you.  I can say it because they're no longer around.  There was a place in Northport when I was living out there on Long Island.  Chinese restaurant went and had one of their chicken dishes.  Three bites in, I'm like, this is... 
[02:30:00]  There was no doubt in my mind I wasn't eating chicken.  I was so fucking sick to my stomach.  Like, what the fuck is this?  It wasn't bad chicken.  It was another meat.  I have no doubt in my mind.  And sure enough, man, that restaurant closed down.  So, I don't know.  Maybe they got desperate and started replacing the chicken with something else.  I don't know.  But I just know for a fact that my fucking soul I wasn't eating chicken that day.  I'll eat at P.F. Chang's.  That's it.  It tasted, like, slightly gamey. 
[02:30:30]  Like, chicken has never tasted gamey to me.  Never.  Never.  So, I'm trying to figure out what the fuck it was.  What's worse than, like, when you get...  I ordered from one Chinese place around our neighborhood, which I think is clean.  It's clean.  It's healthy food.  Yeah, there's a couple.  I've tried them all in our area.  What's more disgusting than diced chicken?  Like, I like white meat.  You always have to ask for white meat.  Yeah.  Because they send you the other stuff.  It's rubbery.  And it's like chicken fat.  Well, no, why?  Because they...  Yeah.  They don't get rid of the fat before they chop it up.  Fucking...  Because they're trying to save a few pennies here and there. 
[02:31:00]  Fucking get rid of the fat.  There's a true story that this girl, one lady was eating at a Chinese restaurant and she sent her food back like twice and four guys in the back jerked off in it or something.  She got really sick and sued them.  You know, they're just...  You would think she would enjoy the taste of sperm.  And not in...  Well, if she was getting sweet and sour.  But it's just I couldn't...  Remember we used to go to Chinatown all the time?  And the last time we went, how fucking gross it was at that place that had all the... 
[02:31:30]  You know, I don't know the name.  Wait, you went down to Chinatown?  We used to go all the time.  You got nowhere to go in.  And everybody used to go after late at night.  You know what?  You know the deal with Chinatown, right?  What's that?  You got nowhere to go.  They have restaurants down there for only Chinese people.  But they can't say that.  So if you go in there, they make your life a living hell so you never go back.  Oh.  I had like a four-hour meal there once.  And we were all out of our minds.  Like, what the fuck's going on?  And we watched Asian people come in and get served right away. 
[02:32:00]  And then someone finally explained to me that, you know, it's Chinatown, which is a tourist trap.  But there's people down there annoyed because there's restaurants just for everybody else that lives in the area.  And they don't want the tourists in there.  They don't need the tourists.  So you got to understand where to go.  Oh.  Well...  That is a fact, too.  A lot of facts today.  And someone finally told me, like, no, this is a real thing that happens in most Chinatowns in your cities.  There's ones that everyone knows that welcome tourists.  But there's a bunch that absolutely don't. 
[02:32:30]  But they don't tell you when you walk in.  Certain foreigners, and I'm not saying what countries or what people, they're not as clean.  I mean, they're not, you know...  I walked into a fast food coffee place, and there was a guy sitting there, I'm not lying, on break, picking his toenails.  I'm not fucking lying.  Ask Bonnie.  He was picking...  I go, Bonnie, he's picking his fucking toenails in public.  Like, his feet are all...  Like, back home in Bangladesh, that might be normal at the donut store, to pick your fucking toenails. 
[02:33:00]  Are we adding all these to the list today?  Huh?  That's an old one.  Huh?  Oh, he said that one already?  Yeah, I think that's an old one.  Bangladesh.  Bang.  Whatever.  So, and he's picking...  What'd you say to him?  I go, what the fuck are you...  I scream, I go, are you disgusting?  You know, then you're gonna put your fingers in the cup, and you're fucking gross.  What are you doing?  And it's nothing to him.  It's nothing.  My favorite Chinese restaurant story is, I think there are two that we did on this show. 
[02:33:30]  Was there one with the cabbage, where they were fucking squashing it with their bare feet or something?  It was cabbage, or it was...  The fuck was it?  I know what you mean.  I can't remember the food.  And there was all sorts of health violations, because they discovered that they dumped it in garbage pails?  The garlic.  They were taking the garlic outside and crushing it on the concrete with his heels.  With his heels or something, with his dirty fucking heels.  Something like that.  And then the other one, which was out of Buffalo, where a Chinese restaurant got shut down, 
[02:34:00]  they discovered that they were serving deer meat instead of chicken, I guess, right?  And one day...  Is this true, Danny?  The fucking deer story with the Chinese restaurant?  One day, they saw the owner of the place dragging a deer through the entire restaurant,  trying to get it into the fucking kitchen.  I remember that story, sure.  And he just assumed that no one was going to report him.  With a blood trail, which obviously they were going to clean up.  These are people that shit in holes, that just squat and shit anyway. 
[02:34:30]  They don't all shit in holes, Rich.  Yeah.  I didn't say all of them.  Some shit on each other in pornography.  There you go.  There you go.  Well, I'm not sure, but...  But that story out of Buffalo, they had to shut that guy down.  Okay.  They just couldn't allow that anymore.  If the dog food they send over here is tainted and toys, what do you...  Like, if you go to the market, do you ever buy seafood in the market?  What?  Do you ever buy seafood at the market?  Like, you go and buy seafood.  Do you read where it's from?  Like, you won't buy your seafood from Vietnam or Indonesia or any of those places. 
[02:35:00]  What?  You know what I'm saying.  Seafood.  What about it?  It's got to be from Canada or fucking America.  Seafood has to be from Canada?  Why?  They're cleaner.  They process it cleaner.  What?  Their fucking farms are cleaner.  Everything's cleaner.  How do you know where you're getting your seafood from?  It says it when you go buy it.  It says from Vietnam.  When there's a bunch of, like, jumbo shrimp on ice.  Yeah.  How do you know where it's from?  It says it at the supermarket.  It'll say...  It says it where? 
[02:35:30]  Right under the price?  Yeah, right next to it.  It says from Indonesia, from Vietnam.  It fucking doesn't say that.  Are you out of your fucking mind?  I...  Listen to me.  I'm telling you.  It says that.  Is there anyone out there that could fucking back me up?  It doesn't say where your seafood's from.  Yes.  In the supermarket.  Yes, it does.  How about it?  It's got, like, salmon fillets, whatever, on ice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it'll say the salmon's from...  Nova Scotia.  I've never seen that before.  Oh, really?  Yeah, really.  Yeah, because you're buying all canned shit, cheap fuck.  When you go buy the real fresh stuff, I'm telling you... 
[02:36:00]  That was very hurtful.  I know.  It wasn't even funny, and I'm sorry.  It was just very hurtful.  I'm sorry.  It was just a funny thing to say.  You're buying canned shit.  It's like...  Have someone call in from a supermarket.  I've never seen that.  It's all labeled.  Jimmy, have you seen your seafood, says seafood from...  I actually never noticed it.  My plan never noticed it.  I never noticed that.  I noticed these things.  That's why we won't buy it.  Hey, where's the deer story, Danny?  I saw you have it up there.  Okay.  Yeah, here it is.  China King in Hamburg is closed tonight after health officials say they found a deer being 
[02:36:30]  butchered in the kitchen.  This is a true story.  Hamburg is outside of Buffalo.  A spokesman for the Erie County Health Department tells two, child two, I guess, on your side.  Okay.  They received a call Friday from a person claiming a deer was being butchered in the South Park Avenue restaurant.  When health officials arrived at the restaurant, they did indeed find employees butchering a dead deer. 
[02:37:00]  Health commissioner blah, blah, blah has scheduled a meeting Tuesday.  Officials say they don't know whether the deer was roadkill or if it had been hunted.  They also say that none of the meat had been served to customers.  Yeah, from that deer.  From that deer.  Right.  You think that was the first time he was doing something with a deer?  That's what's good about L.A.  They have like a number system outside the restaurant.  Yes.  That, you know, one to four or something.  They have little gratings, too, for cleanliness.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And if you have a bad number, you might as well fucking just give up, right? 
[02:37:30]  Who the fuck's going to a bad number restaurant?  Nozawa always gets an A for the cleanliness and stuff.  Sushi Nozawa.  Nozawa.  Yeah.  Even that, I'm scared to eat sushi now.  Not there, you wouldn't be.  Anywhere.  How do they know there's not a fucking piece of bacteria or something in there?  Well, you can get it.  You have to assume that they know how to do it or everybody would just be getting sick  every day eating it.  Right.  See, there's a number of places.  Nobu is very good.  Matsuhisa in L.A.  There's a few places that are good. 
[02:38:00]  There's a place called Gary here on 77th, which is great.  I trust that.  I've eaten a place.  I've eaten a place.  Gary rules.  Bruce doesn't know about this.  No, I just assumed.  Are you crazy?  You're very trashy.  Are you crazy?  You really are trashy.  I've had sushi with you.  You're very trashy.  You're very trashy.  You've never had sushi with me.  I certainly have.  You go to those fucking...  Steve's Sushi Huts.  You buy them out of the machines.  You go like half-priced sushi.  Exactly.  You go to all you eat.  Me and Jimmy have class when we eat our sushi.  We used to go all the time to half-priced sushi. 
[02:38:30]  See?  Of course.  Me and him.  Well, I know you did.  That's why I said that.  I wasn't even going for a joke.  You're a half-priced sushi guy.  No, not anymore.  Much time special.  I ate at that place in...  What's Charlie all about?  Charlie has info on...  Seafood labeling.  I do.  Actually, all seafood...  Hats crooked.  That's how the utes wear them.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  All seafood that goes through Costco, anyway, is printed right on the label, right underneath  the price.  The country that it's farmed in. 
[02:39:00]  Yes.  Every supermarket.  Yeah.  Most...  Could this be the first time Rich Voss has been right and we've been wrong?  Not the first fucking time.  Pretty close, though.  I've been right a lot of times.  Go ahead, Charlie.  How do you know this?  Do you work at Shumor, or being that you've spent a lot of time in...  Yeah, I work at Costco.  Huh?  I work at Costco.  I can't...  Do you work at Costco?  Yeah.  What do you do for them?  Uh...  Drive a forklift.  You ever dream of driving a tractor in life, or do you just want to stop a forklift?  Uh, I think forklift is...  Why are your ears fucking squared off? 
[02:39:30]  I have no idea.  Why do you have rectangle ears?  Your ears have been cuffed.  I was born like that.  My brother used to try and rip them open when I was younger.  This creepy fucking ear.  Holy fuck, your ears are hemmed.  Oh my God.  That's what it looks like, yeah.  Fuck.  I don't like your fucking bed skirt ears.  Terrible.  Let me take a picture of your fucking creepy ears.  Sure.  Oh, they are...  Wow.  Look.  Hold on.  What the fuck?  His mom taped them back when he was growing up?  Forward.  Forward?  Which way?  Yeah, I guess you're right.  Forward.  I didn't see that one. 
[02:40:00]  That one's worse than the other one.  Yeah.  Let me see.  That one's worse than the other one.  See, that one is not as bad.  I would say you could get them fixed, but that would be the A thing on you that you  should work on.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  That's great.  There's nothing wrong with your ears.  Don't do anything stupid.  You know what I mean?  There's something wrong with these ears.  They're rectangles.  No, they're just...  All right, listen.  Let me go to Jason.  Thank you, Charlie.  Jason.  Exactly.  Beat it, fucking square ears.  Fucking cereal box ears.  Jason, what do you got?  Hey, here's what I got regarding the Chinese place in Hamburg. 
[02:40:30]  I used to live in Hamburg.  I was right down the road.  This particular deer was actually hit by one of my colleagues.  I actually taught for a school there, actually.  And I actually hit this deer.  It was over on the side of the road.  And, yeah, they took this and dragged it in the establishment, and they were cutting it  up.  What happened after this?  They actually applied to have their health license reinstated, and they actually reinstated  their license.  So this place actually opened back up after they were seen actually killing a deer inside  the establishment. 
[02:41:00]  Wow.  No kidding.  Who the fuck would go there?  Because, I mean, Buffalo and Hamburg are obviously smaller places, so everyone knows  about the restaurant.  They can't kind of...  Absolutely.  They can't hide the fact that they were a big story in town.  Well, why would they let them?  What kind of sea?  I don't know.  Interesting enough, there was another Chinese place right across the street from them,  kind of kitty corner.  They were caught a number of years ago by the DEC, and they had actually seagulls in  their freezer.  They had five or six seagulls, so rather than shutting them down, they charged them $500 
[02:41:30]  per seagull.  Jesus.  That's unbelievable.  And they didn't shut them down.  They didn't shut them down.  The DEC just said, well, you can't handle these.  They're prohibitive.  And charged them the state limit for having an unauthorized, I suppose, game bird without  a license, of course, permit, per bird.  So $500 per bird, rather than shutting them down.  And you know, I'm sure there's a lot of Chinese restaurants doing the right thing and serving  terrific Chinese food, but there's also some horrific things going on. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, but it goes on with all restaurants.  Oh, yeah.  You can tell you, if you want to know a good restaurant, I mean, there's tons of ways,  but the first thing is walk in the bathroom and see how clean that is.  Yeah.  If it's not fucking masculine.  The Chinese place is always a disgusting bathroom.  Me and my girl, thank you, Jason.  We were out and about with people.  I can't remember.  We're trying to remember where we were, and she had to use the bathroom.  And she goes into the bathroom of this restaurant.  We didn't even eat in there.  It's one of those shit, she's got to use the bathroom type things, right? 
[02:42:30]  She goes in there.  She comes running right out.  I'm like, what the fuck?  She goes, there's cockroaches all over the bathroom.  And that was the women's room.  So I went into the men's room.  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  Sure enough, cockroaches everywhere.  Everywhere.  Everywhere.  How do you run a business and not take care of the cockroach problem where it's obviously  right there in the bathroom?  Me and Bonnie were eating in a fucking place downtown, down the street from the cellar.  And we're sitting there eating, me, her, and Rick Shapiro and some whatever fucking psychopath 
[02:43:00]  broad he was with at the time, okay, that could deal with his psychopath.  And we're eating.  All of a sudden, mice are running across the floor in the restaurant.  Right.  And we go to the people, I go, there's mice running.  Look, you can see it.  It's right here.  It's hiding behind the garbage.  And they said, ah, yeah, they're here all the time.  Like it was nothing.  They're just used to it after a while.  Really?  Unbelievable.  And then they charge us full pop and not even offered dessert.  Why would you want dessert from a place that has mice running around?  No, I wouldn't take it.  I wasn't going to take it.  Exactly.  I wasn't going to take it. 
[02:43:30]  And why did you continue eating?  We stopped eating.  Oh, okay.  We didn't eat anymore.  But you're mad they didn't offer you dessert?  Or take money off the dish.  Yeah, I agree.  They should have.  Right.  I had that happen in a place around.  It's like, how do you not fucking throw?  What are you looking at?  Look how hot she is.  That's Donald Trump's wife.  Is that Trump's wife?  Wow.  Yeah, it is.  Let's say hi to Tommy in Chicago.  Fantastic.  Tommy.  Melania.  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Her legs are a little thin for me.  She's like a model's body.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to leave a ton.  Her legs are as thin as her arms.  Yeah, she's a model. 
[02:44:00]  She's sexy.  What do you got, Tommy?  Well, first of all, as much as it pains me to agree with Boston, his oversized dentures,  he is actually right that they do have to, by law, stay where the fish is from.  I believe all you guys.  I just never saw that before.  Never noticed.  And they're not oversized.  I'm getting new teeth, sir.  Very good.  And let me tell the fucking audience members that come to the shows.  Thank you, ONA listeners that came to Allentown.  But there's always one that thinks he can throw stuff in from the show, and he's part 
[02:44:30]  of it, and he knows me.  I fucking smashed this guy so fucking bad Saturday night, his girlfriend walked out on him and  left and went home because he made it go.  Ooh, he's doing, like, little references.  I go, listen, you fucking cocksuckers.  You're not Opie.  You're not Anthony.  You're not Norton.  Yay!  You mentioned me.  So don't fucking pretend that you are in that category.  You're an animal on this stage.  They do that to Bob Kelly sometimes, too.  It's like, they mistake the fact that we break each other's balls as friends.  And it's like, you forget that he's a professional comic. 
[02:45:00]  He's going to shred you.  You don't know him like that.  Yeah.  Tommy, hold on for a sec, okay?  I saw Jay Moore, what, last weekend at Gotham?  He was having a great set.  A great set.  Who was he doing?  Huh?  And this guy that was sitting literally right behind me at a little table just kept yelling,  do Christopher Walken, do Christopher Walken, do Christopher, over and over again.  And then Jay, obviously, finally humored the guy because he really wanted to move on with 
[02:45:30]  his show.  And I'm sure Jay Moore was going to do Walken eventually.  And now it was out of place.  And it was like he was just, you know, catering to this one fucking asshole.  Why didn't they throw the guy out?  I don't know, man.  It was so frustrating.  Let the comic do his thing, man.  He's got a whole thing.  And if the guy's known for something, trust me, he's going to get to it.  That's where Caroline's is beautiful.  Literally, if you're eating and your fork hits the plate too loud, they fucking walk over  and grab you by the throat.  Oh, that fucking club doesn't tolerate one ounce of tomfoolery in the audience. 
[02:46:00]  And they drag you.  Caroline's rules.  And they drag you upstairs to throw you out of the street.  And trust me, it hurts.  They don't tolerate any bullshit.  But this guy made the whole show about himself.  He needed to hear Christopher Walken.  Everyone was enjoying themselves.  Jay had a lot of stories, a lot of good stuff.  And, you know, it still was a great show.  But for about 10 or 15 minutes, it threw Jay off.  The audience was like, what are you doing?  I think that's where the club should walk over and go, sir, if you yell that nonsense again,  we're going to make you pay your bill and throw you the fuck out of the place. 
[02:46:30]  And it wasn't like the guy didn't know any better.  It was obnoxiously so.  Like, all right, shut up.  He heard you, obviously.  To Walken.  What are you yelling out for in a public place, you cunt?  Tommy in Chicago.  Yeah.  Hey.  So anyway, we had a – I'm a fireman up here.  We had a fire in a Chinese restaurant.  And we were throwing away all the chicken and stuff that was sitting out because it got a bunch of, like,  the extinguisher and all that stuff all over it.  And we actually, as we were finishing up, we saw the guys in the back in the dumpster pulling all the chicken out, 
[02:47:00]  bringing it back in to wash it so they could reuse it.  We called the health department.  The health department came out, threw it back in the dumpster and poured bleach all over it,  which still didn't stop.  And they still had to pull all the chicken back in.  And they tried to wash the bleach off.  At which point, the health department had to shut them down.  You hear this?  You hear this?  You hear this?  That's unbelievable.  That's a true story, Tommy?  Absolutely.  Jesus.  Thank you, man.  I appreciate it.  Let's go to Steve in Philly.  Steve, hold on one more because this guy has been waiting a while. 
[02:47:30]  Steve.  What's up, Queef?  Hey, brother.  Now, I'm a plumber.  I've been doing work in Chinese restaurants 13 years.  One story that always comes back to me is,  sure, it was backed up all through the kitchen.  They had the food that just floats inside, like a Tupperware bin,  sitting on the floor, smoking cigarettes, ashes everywhere.  But what killed me was I was at the job for four hours.  They're sitting there skinning bullfrogs, cutting the hearts out.  Long story short, the job's done.  I said to the guy who offers his dinner, I said, I really want frog. 
[02:48:00]  The guy goes, we talked about there's no frog here.  Well, come to find out, frog actually tastes like chicken.  Very, very common with the Chinese restaurant.  Dirtiest fucking place on the planet.  I wonder if I was eating frog then in that restaurant.  What's that?  I'm wondering what I was eating in Northport.  Maybe it was frog.  It's definitely not chicken, though.  How much cheaper can frog be than chicken?  You can't be any cheaper of a food than chicken.  Frogs are pretty cheap.  You don't have to fucking buy them.  Yeah, you just go catch them. 
[02:48:30]  You go to a little fucking pond.  It's inevitable.  If you know where they're fucking hanging out, it's very cheap, Rich.  Exactly.  There's frog bait.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Frog bait will fucking get frogs from fucking a while, man.  Yep.  I mean, it's like married with children.  Every time you're in there, they're just sitting there smoking over the food.  And you go to use the bathroom in the back of the kitchen.  There's never any soap.  The bathrooms are disgusting.  It's like there's dirty fucking filthy hands touching everything.  The bathrooms in Chinese places are fucking horrendous.  It's horrendous. 
[02:49:00]  I was in Hong Kong.  I love you.  The food there was fucking so gross.  It was so gross.  Hong Kong?  Yeah.  Make love?  Why?  I don't know where I was going.  I just didn't.  We didn't know how to read anything.  You were in Hong Kong.  What do you mean you don't know where you were going?  I mean, we don't know how to wear.  Yeah.  I mean, I didn't know where.  You were Bonnie?  No.  It was when I was a comic.  I had to fly 15 hours with Jim David behind me, spitting on the back of my neck, talking.  Why didn't you sit next to each other?  Yeah.  Because I had the whole seat to lay down on. 
[02:49:30]  It's a 15-hour flight.  You were in a coach?  To play.  This was years ago.  I didn't have fucking money.  I'd still be in a coach.  Just rub this cock.  Huh?  Rub this cock.  Yeah.  Let him go.  Show him who's fucking.  Who's boss?  Yeah.  Who's in charge?  Show him who's boss.  Who's boss.  Here's the thing.  And I'm not telling you how to do what you do because you do it great.  But I think when a caller calls and tells a story and you go true story, if it was a  lie, do you think that was the pressure that would turn him around and go, you're right,  it was a lie? 
[02:50:00]  Do you know what I'm saying?  No.  I'm completely baffled by what you just said.  Two callers ago, the guy called.  Did he say true story or did I?  You did.  You go true story.  I just wanted to fucking hammer it home like, you know, this guy knows what he's doing.  Oh, okay.  It's a problem.  All right.  I thought you were cross-examining him and he was going to twist.  I just wanted to pump it up a little bit.  Make sure people were hearing a true story.  True story?  You're probably right, you fucking asshole.  Where are you going to be, Rich?  We've got to take a break.  I'll be at Motley's.  Then we're going to talk about your top five tech fucking gadgets after the break. 
[02:50:30]  I'm at fucking Motley's Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in Boston.  And if you can't catch me there, you can catch me at, what do you call it?  Standing in somebody's lawn holding a lantern.  At Granite Lynx.  I'll be there Friday and Saturday.  All right, but Motley's in Boston.  No, Motley's.  I'm just fucking around with that one.  I love seeing Rich, man, do his stand-up.  Absolutely love it.  And Jimmy's going to be at the Improv in Pittsburgh this weekend, so.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  So you've got choices, depending on where you live.  Can you guys be back into the Improv? 
[02:51:00]  Why don't you work on them?  Yeah, what's wrong with you in the Improv?  I don't know.  Fucking who knows?  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know.  I just, uh.  Did you, um, you know.  I guess, uh, you know.  What did you do?  I didn't do anything.  You didn't send a tape for us, did you?  Is he one of those comics?  Yes, I sent a tape for us.  No, that's what, uh, I was working at a club once, years ago.  Do you want to hear this?  Can we take a break?  No, no, this is quick.  All right.  Years ago, years ago.  Go, go.  Before any TV, and I'm on stage, and it was at stand-up New York.  Before any TV, we were working there like the fucking 30s? 
[02:51:30]  I was at stand-up New York.  I'm doing a show.  I'm doing a show.  You know, a special show there.  And then the fucking club owner.  I'm doing a show there, and the club owner was there watching the show.  And then I said, can I work this club?  He goes, can you send me a tape?  I go, you just fucking saw me.  That's what they used to do.  They, can you send a tape?  You know what I mean?  Okay.  That was the story.  But it is true.  I mean, they are awful.  Club owners.  Why don't we take a break, Rich?  Get me back in.  We're going to do tech gadgets next week.  Your top five tech gadgets. 
[02:52:00]  It's whether you're using them or you think they're really cool in general.  Okay?  All right, we'll figure it out.  I can tell some cool ones, I think.  You think?  Yeah, fuck yeah.  All right.  How's everybody today?  Good?  Good?  Good.  Good.  Oh, I got a quickie.  Over the weekend, I was watching MSNBC.  Don't tell Anthony. 
[02:52:30]  And a guy said blowjob while I was watching on MSNBC.  And he was a real creep of a guy.  I filmed it, but the glare on my TV is horrendous.  That had horrendous glare.  But I got the audio for everybody.  Why'd he say it?  Well, I'll just play it.  Basically, they were doing a story on how they, what, the $100 bill they changed?  Is that it, right?  Did they?  And what's going on with our money is they're making the presidents look nicer and nicer as 
[02:53:00]  the years go on.  Like, they're getting rid of frown lines and they're softening up their look in general  and making their hair look better and all that.  But even though, like, the original money probably was very accurate to what the guy looked like,  right?  So they had a plastic surgeon.  I guess this is what happens when you've got to fill up 24 hours of news.  You have a lot of dumb stories that mean nothing.  They had a plastic surgeon on who was discussing, you know, why they're doing this in our culture  or something like that. 
[02:53:30]  See, there you go.  Ben Franklin.  This one, they didn't really fucking clean him up too much.  The hot one is a new one.  He looks more wrinkled.  They have his whole body on there.  Jesus, he's got his fucking shoes.  What?  I like the new one.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Well, they're doing it.  Yeah, go, Rich.  A lot of the reason they're doing it is because they're counterfeiting them over in Taiwan  and other countries and they're flooding our market with counterfeit $100 bills.  They're easy to counterfeit.  So they got to keep staying one step ahead of the counterfeiters.  They might say it's because of appearance, but it's because they're fucking being counterfeiting. 
[02:54:00]  That's why I don't think they deny the counterfeiting.  Are they out now or no?  No, but they're changing his appearance too.  That would have nothing to do with the counterfeiting part because they're putting all sorts of fucking  stuff in within the dollar.  Unless it's so you can't just stamp the old picture on the new one.  Yeah.  They added more to him now.  Oh, you think that?  Maybe.  For counterfeiting reasons.  Well, let me ask you.  Sorry.  All right, whatever.  Is it out yet or no?  I know these things.  It's not, but they're not cleaning up Benjamin Franklin just for counterfeiting reasons. 
[02:54:30]  That's what they're, that's what they were talking about on the news.  They changed the entire dollar to make it harder to counterfeit.  Yes.  I'm smart.  I'm smart.  So here's the audio that I captured over the weekend as I was watching.  Andrew Jackson, of course, the $20 bill there.  The far left, 1928.  You can see eyelid kind of fat bags, I guess, if you want to call them those.  It's redesigned in 98, I don't know, it's looking like filled with injectables for the  temple lines and the hollow, you know, laugh lines. 
[02:55:00]  And then on the right, the current one since 2003, it looks like he's got his hair blown  out, you know?  Indeed.  Actually, a lot of changes, not necessarily for the better.  As you alluded to, they filled in his temples and his laugh lines with some injectables.  And they've really done a really nice blowjob, hair dry.  And it looks like he has the smock on from the hairdresser.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:55:30]  There you go.  The guy's saying blowjob instead of blow dry.  Nice, right?  Yeah.  He's a good boy.  He's a good boy.  He meant well.  Thank you.  Harriet.  All right, Rich.  That was a quickie, whatever.  Let's do your tech stuff.  Yeah?  The tech?  Yeah, the tech gadgets?  What do you think of my new radio voice?  I hate it.  I want to talk like this from now on.  I fucking hate it.  Really smooth radio guy. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, I want to know what the people out there think of my new radio voice.  2011.  Smooth.  Yeah, go right ahead.  Yeah, Rich.  What's up?  Tech guy.  Can we put the dog collar on you?  That can never happen.  Why?  Why not?  Really.  Listen to me.  Let me explain something.  Yeah.  There's certain limits that Rich Voss will go to.  I give enough to the station where I'm not going to be physically harmed. 
[02:56:30]  After the broken elbow is when I drew the wrong.  That's what you had.  You really did draw on the sand.  Happy birthday.  Let's break your bone.  Why do you have to bring up the same shit every time you're here?  I have nothing to do with it.  My elbow hasn't been the same.  Bob is such a bully.  He doesn't realize that you can't throw him on the ground.  You had nothing to do with it.  You were the one who went at me first.  Robert Kelly went too hard.  Yes, he did.  Because he's a moose and he doesn't know.  What was it?  On stage in front of what?  At the Mohegan Sun on my birthday. 
[02:57:00]  How many people?  I don't even know.  There was a lot of people.  We brought out a nice cake for you at the end of the show.  Me and Bob, I believe I was helping with the cake.  Then Bob took it upon himself to really make it hurt.  Then because you're an old fucking guy, you slid on the icing on the fucking stage and broke your own elbow.  Listen, fucking Danny Delusion.  Kenny, do you remember?  Let me explain to you.  Bob doesn't know how to do things like that because he's just too brutal.  He wants to kill the girl in a barn by petting her hair.  Kenny, how do you remember the broken elbow incident with Rich Voss? 
[02:57:30]  There should be a YouTube video.  There is.  All right.  And it was probably Rich's fault.  It was definitely your fault.  You couldn't just sit there and appreciate the nice gesture.  We gave you a cake at the end of the show.  It's your fault.  For trying to walk off with the cake and share my present that you gave me.  You broke your own elbow.  Yeah, as the whole crew was coming at me.  Remember how swollen it got?  OP Sharpton led the pack.  Them fucking stupid Bob. 
[02:58:00]  Why are you blaming me?  Bob shoved it aggressively into your face.  Listen, I don't need to.  Is it up there somewhere?  Well, anyhow, there's no reason.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's see.  How did Bonnie look?  What the fuck happened?  All right.  Bonnie kisses you.  It's all nice.  In front of the crowd.  There's the cake.  We blow out the candles.  So far, so good.  I'm just, I'm just standing on stage.  I'm thinning.  Look at him.  Look at the fucking. 
[02:58:30]  Louis C.K.  Robert Kelly.  Bobby.  Look at C.  Bobby Linger.  Look at Opie there.  Who's going first?  I'm doing nothing.  Yeah, look at Opie.  Oh, yeah.  Who was the first fucking idiot?  And stupid Bobby.  Look at him.  I broke my elbow.  And look how excited Bobby is.  It doesn't matter how excited he is.  Bobby throws his hat into the audience.  He's so happy that you're on the ground with a broken elbow.  And look at the wrist with cake all over him. 
[02:59:00]  Look at Bonnie.  Stupid codependent.  With a fucking broken elbow.  Whose fault was that, Kenny?  You saw the video.  It looks like he threw himself on the ground.  Thank you, Kenny.  Like a wrestling move.  Thank you, Kenny.  See?  Gosh, she looks good.  Oh, she was pregnant.  See?  No, fuck Bobby.  Who was?  Whose fault?  It was.  Oh, look at.  Look at Dom Patrice.  Look at Patrice.  Oh, shit.  Look at Patrice.  He's so funny.  Well, look at Bobby.  He's so excited.  He's going to throw his nice hat into the audience.  He's so proud of what he just did. 
[02:59:30]  He's Pete Townsend.  All right.  We'll fucking tweet that video, too, I guess.  Well, he has the same hard drive, at least.  Yeah.  All right.  Rich.  So, there goes your dog collar.  That's why.  That's when you finally had it with us?  Well, no.  I mean, you know.  Like I said.  You know.  I add so much.  Rich and, you know, some stuff, you know, you just got to draw the line.  It's happy birthday, Rich Voss, on YouTube.  God, that's, you know.  And you can see the video.  You can get.  Check it out.  You can get through it, too.  And you could.  I love the set.  I mean, it was a great set for that virus show. 
[03:00:00]  It was fun, man.  Holy shit.  What high school made that for us?  I don't know.  But I remember that show.  That's the one.  That's.  You're serious for a second.  What?  I thought you were serious for a second.  Of course not.  Caliendo had a tough time.  I had better fucking sets when I was doing high school plays at Harbor Fields High School.  Caliendo had a tough time.  Because you fuckers wanted so much money for that show.  The caution tape really lets you know that you're about to see something dangerous.  See, look at the police tape.  We wanted so much money.  Watch out.  Watch out.  I was saying, Caliendo had a tough time, but yet now he signed like a, what, $800 million deal in Vegas. 
[03:00:30]  Not that big.  It was a big deal.  $900 million.  Big.  Yeah.  Caliendo is one of those Vegas comics now, right?  He's going to be stuck out there for years.  But Frank's the type of guy.  For great money.  For like $10 million.  He'll have a great life out there.  Caliendo is a good impressionist.  Is he getting $10 million a year?  It's stupid money.  He's getting stupid money.  Frank's perfect for Vegas because he does impressions.  They're great impressions.  Oh, my God. 
[03:01:00]  And they love, like, Danny Gans is dead, and Danny was the guy out there.  Frank gave him the Coke.  Go ahead.  Is that what he died of?  No, I think.  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know how he died.  Yeah, I don't know how he died, so I'm not saying that.  It was a joke.  I have no idea.  It was a tragedy.  Yeah.  Because that guy was fucking Vegas, right?  He was the number one guy.  He was a fucking...  It was signs for...  You didn't know who Danny Gans was unless you were in Vegas, but he got famous just from  being in Vegas.  Yeah.  And I don't know if they filled that slot, but I mean, look, Siegfried and Roy are gone.  Danny Gans died. 
[03:01:30]  Lucille Ball died.  It just said that.  77.  I just saw it on TV.  Did she just pass away today?  Or has she been dead?  This is not happening right now.  Has she been dead?  This is not happening right now.  Oh, yeah.  She's been dead for a while.  Go ahead.  That was what this name's bit.  What happens?  Do you even know how to drive home?  That's what his name's bit.  Kevin Sullivan.  What?  Lucy's in the sky with Desi.  You're right.  Go ahead. 
[03:02:00]  Tell what you're saying about...  No, we can't just move on from the fact that they saw that on TV.  Lucille Ball dead.  Lucille Ball died.  Yeah.  Do you know...  Do you...  Huh?  She died.  Ready for this, Rich?  Did you hear the bad news out of Dallas?  Dealey Plaza?  Rich, Lucille Ball died 21 years ago.  And did she die today?  And she's still as strong as ever on TV.  She died 21 years ago?  And you thought that maybe she just died, right?  She would have been 90 fucking 8 today.  She died at 77. 
[03:02:30]  21 years ago?  Fuck, I was sober then, too.  Well, there's a gadget I should work on.  Kenny's still laughing.  Who is?  Kenny.  I just saw it on TV, and I was like, whoa, man, that's sad news.  She just...  That's sad news.  It's like only hearing part of the story and then acting like you know everything about it.  Like, I just glimpsed at the TV and saw Lucille Ball.  You didn't know she was dead.  Come on.  Well, if I would have thought about it, I would have said, yeah, yeah, she's dead. 
[03:03:00]  Why would you think about it before you say something?  I can't think about every celebrity that's dead or every person.  I don't fucking remember.  That's an obvious one, though.  I bet you just, like, if you go to...  When was the last time you heard about her?  All the time.  Her name comes up.  All right.  In our documentary.  Rich, we gave you a little thing.  Just because, you know, you do tech stuff.  You're going to do a tech show with Laszlo hopefully soon.  I'll try one day.  I don't know.  I'm about that guy.  I spoke to Laszlo about it.  He's definitely down to do it. 
[03:03:30]  Wait, you don't like Laszlo?  No, I don't know him that well.  He stinks.  I don't like that guy.  Okay, listen.  So we asked you to bring in five, your list of five tech gadgets that you like or you have.  That's right.  All right?  Yeah.  I mean, because, you know, there's a lot of tech stuff out there.  Well, my first new, and I've had it before, but now I upgraded a great piece of tech, an instrument for someone who saves a lot of stuff on the computer is to get an external hard drive, which I have two. 
[03:04:00]  I have three.  One the editor has, one I have, and I have one that I travel with.  A small one.  I haven't traveled with it in a while, but if I have to, it's a smaller one.  And the external hard drive I have now is one and a half, one and a half terabytes, which is a fucking ton of megabytes in a terabyte. 
[03:04:30]  It's a bunch of gigabytes, too.  Gigabytes, terabytes.  No, but what you got to do is it's just tons of stuff.  So the external hard drive is, it's great because your computer fills up with just a bunch of useless shit, you know, and then it's so easy.  You just click and send to K.  What do you call the file that you hide cock pictures in? 
[03:05:00]  My mind.  See, then the brilliance comes out.  It's just, I know, my mind.  What the?  So, do you have any...  How can you be that quick and that funny, but you don't know Lucille Ball died 21 years ago?  Do you understand you were off by over two decades?  What?  What?  She passed it.  What?  What would it be?  That's stuff that I'll send to my external hard drive now.  Facts about...  And what's this K thing about?  Well, that's, you know, you go to, on your computer... 
[03:05:30]  Just push the K key?  No, no, no, no, no.  It's going over, like, what do you call that?  Like, it's K drive.  The K drive is where my external hard drive is now.  You have the C drive where most of your stuff goes.  The D drive that you don't even know what the fuck is there for.  Well, you can't get into the D drive unless you can break down that fucking wall between C and D.  Well, the D drive...  Which I have no idea how to break down the wall.  The D drive is normally the fucking DVD player.  What's that?  The DVD player is normally the D drive. 
[03:06:00]  No, you can send over files and stuff you save to the D drive if you know how to get through the fucking wall between the C and D drive.  If you know, if you're smart enough.  I don't know.  So, if the C drive fills up, you send the shit over to the external hard drive, which is the K drive, and then you erase the shit on the C drive.  What's on your D drive?  What's on my D drive?  I can't get to it.  I don't know.  On my D drive...  Is it a backup of your hard drive?  Is it a backup of your operating system?  Because I have one, too.  I have a big, giant Mac computer that has two fucking hard drives. 
[03:06:30]  Massive ones.  And I just go back and...  What you do is you can have icons on your desktop and then open either one.  It's easy to go back and forth.  On your D drive?  No, if you have...  Say you have a half an hour...  Your half an hour special on your C drive.  Or my hour.  Your hour.  Either one.  You know, whatever unwatchable special you have.  Okay.  On your C drive.  Okay.  All right?  You can't go to your fucking D drive and look at it.  You have to go to your C drive. 
[03:07:00]  I can put it on both.  If you can get to...  You can put it on both?  You know how to send your stuff to your D drive?  Sure.  What you do is this.  You open up...  On the desktop, you have two little icons.  Okay?  One is called C and one is called D.  Mm-hmm.  You can fucking open up something on the C drive and just drag it and drop it into the D drive.  That's how I would do it.  No.  Do you drop...  Maybe you could do that on the Apple.  Yeah, I drop...  That's how...  Yes.  When I'm burning DVDs from our movie, I'll take what's already downloaded in C drive 
[03:07:30]  and I'll drag it to the...  And drop it in and burn it and back it up on a CD or DVD, you know.  But that's not all use for a movie.  That's just in case, you know, I have like 40 different ways to back this shit up.  So your first tech gadget...  That I love.  That you love is the...  External hard drive.  That whole fucking terabyte thing is a whole nother level.  All right.  You can't fuck with terabytes.  Especially since they don't exist. 
[03:08:00]  What do you mean?  What are they called?  Not what you think they're called.  They're terabytes.  Yeah.  Terabytes?  Yeah.  It's not.  What's it called?  That's what Tara eats.  Okay.  All right.  So I like my externals.  All right.  What's your next tech gadget that you're doing?  That I like?  Well, yeah.  Well, and this isn't even a tough tech gadget, but I got it three years ago for my birthday  was my...  What do you call it?  My Sky Caddy, which is a golf GPS where you download courses. 
[03:08:30]  It is onto your GPS.  Now, you could do it on your iPhone now, which I tried the other day, but the only problem...  And the iPhone is much better with the core...  With Sky Logic, it's much better, but it eats up the power in your iPhone.  Like, after one round, your fucking battery is shot.  I don't have a backup battery, which they said you could get for an iPhone.  I don't know how to do that, but eventually I will get the backup battery. 
[03:09:00]  Because there is a thing...  Sorry.  I'll give it to you.  Huh?  There is a thing that you can get for your iPhone where you put it around...  It's slippery, though, which I don't like.  You put it around the phone like this case, and it has a battery charger.  You can use that.  Okay.  That's something I'll look into when I'm...  All right.  I have fire.  So you got a Sky Caddy.  Those things are really cool if you put it around.  Okay.  So you got just two...  Excuse me.  You got two...  What's your...  Hold on.  But I'm making fun of Rich for being, you know, dumb and all, and I...  Did I say that Ben Franklin was a president?  Great.  That's wonderful. 
[03:09:30]  Sorry.  Ben Franklin was not a president.  No.  I do know that.  No.  He was a guy with the fucking white stockings and a kite.  And a kite.  He was a kite flyer.  You could see him in...  He should have been a...  Right before Sheepshead Bay, if you're driving down a belt.  Yeah.  Why...  They're flying kites.  Really?  Can you fucking drive?  You don't like people that fly kites?  I hate how that stuff fucking stop to look at it.  Why are people stopping to watch...  Because they're assholes.  They're fucking kites.  If they were flying...  What kind of kites are they?  It has nothing to do with it.  I don't know.  What kind of kites are they that people have to slow down to check it out? 
[03:10:00]  Big juicy cock kites.  That's one in a million.  You never flew a kite, Rich?  Huh?  Never flew a kite?  It's fun until you have to reel that fucker in.  Then you're like, why did I let out so much line?  I'm going to be here all day.  Reel it in.  You got enough money to let it go.  And buy another one.  What the fuck?  No, I haven't flown kites in decades.  I'm talking when I was a fucking kid when it mattered.  Yeah.  You put it on the fishing pole and let it go.  And then you're stuck there fucking reeling it in for hours.  That's a good idea on a fishing pole. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, my God.  That's the only way to fly a kite.  There you go.  There's a big cock kite for you.  All right.  So what's your third gadget, Rich?  Well, you didn't discuss the golf caddy.  What do you want to know about it?  No, I mean, it's pretty much self-explanatory.  Your ball's there.  Well, it's not that easy to...  You aim the golf caddy at the flag, I guess?  No.  No, no, no.  That's where you're wrong.  That would be the binocular one.  That would be the one that you hold in your hand.  Wait.  So your ball is just on the ground.  Yes.  And it's marked off by satellites, through a satellite. 
[03:11:00]  And, you know, they mark off the course.  How does it know where your ball is?  They'll tell you the distance to the front, middle, and back of the green.  Okay.  From where you're standing.  From where you're standing.  Where the sky caddy is.  I got it.  Yes.  Okay.  Got you.  To the green.  Right.  And...  What if you want to know, like, the yardage of a sand trap that's maybe 20 yards short of the green?  It'll have that distance, too.  And I have the older version, three years old.  Which I'm not re-upping, because I'm not paying $50 a year to re-up it.  That a boy, Rich.  Fucking dumb skies. 
[03:11:30]  That a boy.  I'm going over to my iPhone.  That a boy.  Golf Logic.  So, what I'm saying is, it'll mark off traps and hazards.  Okay.  It didn't help me at all last week at Bethpage, where I fucking had a meltdown.  But it's a great...  I told you I wasn't going to play that place.  For that reason.  It was a nightmare.  It was a fucking horrifying.  You played Black.  Yeah.  The Black course is where they have the U.S. Open.  It's a nightmare course.  It's just...  It's one of the hardest courses in America.  Just destroy everything.  And it's early in the golf season, Rich calls and goes, let's play Bethpage Black. 
[03:12:00]  I'm like, no fucking way.  It's not fun.  No, I played again the week after.  I played again the week after.  It was a fucking nightmare.  Anyhow.  It's not fun.  Okay.  Okay, so I like that.  That's one of my favorite gadgets.  Is that...  That's your second gadget?  Yeah.  Okay.  I can't now live without...  And I bought two of them.  One for Bonnie and one for...  I actually bought this one for Bonnie for Christmas one year, but I just bought it for her for Christmas, but I knew I'd use it.  It was basically for me, but I counted it as a present for her, was my GPS, my Garmin or Carmen or whatever the fuck it is. 
[03:12:30]  On the road, there was nothing that's more handy than my GPS.  It shows you where the Walmarts are, where...  You need Walmarts?  I love fucking going to Walmart after the show and just fucking getting stuff.  What do you get out of Walmart?  Fucking, you know, golf balls and pita bread, you know, shit like that.  I'd love you to make a sandwich from those two things. 
[03:13:00]  You know, I'll fucking get rid of it.  Now we understand your teeth, man.  Those fucking golf ball sandwiches are tough.  Great teeth for damn building.  As much as you want to laugh at the guy, that's exactly what you could get at Walmart.  You can get pita bread and golf balls, so...  So, uh...  Anything else you get at Walmart besides the pita bread and the...  You know, who knows, late at night, some groceries or whatever.  I feel like I'm doing a Kids Say the Darnest Things segment right now with you. 
[03:13:30]  It's an old show, Rich.  Yeah, I know.  Okay.  Okay.  It was an observation.  Relax.  Well, the GPS...  Now, I want to know what else you go into Walmart to get.  Late at night, I don't know.  Maybe I'll go get a snack or I'll get a fucking...  Batteries.  I don't fucking know.  Anything just to fucking do something after the show.  Tell us more about the GPS.  So, the GPS now...  I mean, there's so many...  If you need gas, there's so many things on... 
[03:14:00]  What I want to know is, and I'm going to look into it, if there's a talking GPS on the iPhone, which I'm sure there must be because it has everything, and I might...  Well, ask Travis.  Travis knows a bit or two about apps.  Yeah, if they have...  Travis, you know anything on the GPS for the iPhone?  Yeah, TomTom's got an app.  It's like a hundred bucks.  You're basically buying another GPS.  Yeah?  But it's a complete GPS on the iPhone.  On the iPhone?  It's a hundred bucks?  Yeah.  What the fuck needs that for a hundred bucks? 
[03:14:30]  Well, Ed, what do you think a...  What do you call?  It costs two hundred.  You trust the iPhone's fucking connection over a real GPS connection?  You nuts!  Sorry, I'm yelling, but...  Fuck it.  That just makes me angry.  Yeah, personally, I wouldn't use it because then you're using your phone as a GPS, so...  So you can't really use it.  Yeah, it's fucking...  You're not supposed to use it while you're driving anyhow.  Really?  Really fucking goody gumdrops?  And let me tell you something else.  You're not supposed to think of Cox Paul, you fucking woman, but let me stop you.  Let me tell you about that. 
[03:15:00]  I need something to get me hard.  Here's the thing with the iPhone, too, that you might not know.  If you're using this app and the phone rings, Bing, you answer the phone, Bing, you hang  it up.  It goes right back to the app.  So what I'm saying is, while I'm on the phone, I'm sure it's going to be not a quick  turn here, a quick turn there.  Is the GPS for the iPhone good?  Does anyone know?  It's gotten good reviews.  I mean, TomTom makes it, so...  Yeah.  The one they had for the BlackBerry really sucked, but I haven't tried one in a couple  of years now.  But the one they did have a few generations ago, it was just a useless fucking thing. 
[03:15:30]  I love TomTom.  I used to use TomTom when I was in L.A. as a portable one.  It was great.  TomTom knows.  TomTom knows.  Although they're becoming obsolete because most cars now have some sort of a fucking GPS.  Oh, my God.  It's almost standard at this point, right?  Yeah.  New cars almost.  What I don't understand are these rental car companies that when you go rent a car, they'll  go, would you like a GPS at $14.95 a day?  Some fucking jamoke will get it for a fucking week.  Stop saying jamoke. 
[03:16:00]  Did I say it again?  You don't like the word jamoke?  Yeah.  It's your 30th time using your new word.  I've used it forever.  Shut your mouth.  I've used it forever.  Is this your new word, Rich?  Jamoke, exactly.  I don't know why.  You should write some new jamokes.  Now, see, that's where the crowd...  It's a good joke.  I know.  It's a good joke.  I don't care what the crowd gets.  That was...  How else am I going to play with the word jamoke?  I have to say jamokes as in jokes.  Everyone knows it was just a joke for the radio show.  It was just a jamoke.  Rich, you're terrific. 
[03:16:30]  All right, listen to me.  You're terrific on the radio.  I wouldn't say that to Colin or anybody.  You're terrific on the stage.  Oh, Jesus.  You should be back in the improvs.  I don't know what the fuck you did wrong there.  You should be fucking laying next to Lucille Ball.  Right, you should.  The good thing about the GPS...  So these fucking idiots don't go rent a car, spend $14.95.  They could have went out and bought one.  They could have went right to fucking Walmart,  maybe said hi to me, and bought a GPS.  But isn't it a lot more expensive to buy one at the Walmart?  Maybe people don't travel as much as you. 
[03:17:00]  Exactly.  So it's cheaper to just rent one every once in a while.  But they don't want to carry it in their luggage.  It's also cheaper to go to rent a furniture, you know, for the quick fix.  But you want to buy your own couch.  You don't want to rent a couch.  I fucking...  I used to...  I had the portable TomTom, because I was traveling so much.  You used to rent furniture?  No, but you see people that do that.  And what happens?  What happens?  If you don't...  You can only rent it for a certain amount of time?  I don't fucking know.  All I've seen is rent a center.  You know, people getting couches and shit like that, 
[03:17:30]  where you can get anywhere.  Okay.  You know.  All right, so what else on the GPS?  That's it?  I love it.  That's number three gadget that you like.  I mean, there's ones I want to get that I don't know a lot about that I'll get to.  I mean, obviously, I like my radar detector.  After I got a speeding ticket coming back...  You know, I was coming back from Harrisburg, not this year, working there the year before,  and I'm in a car with Bonnie, and her friend was with us, Lynn.  Can you get more details? 
[03:18:00]  What was the weather like?  What was Lynn wearing?  Can I tell the story?  Listen to me.  What fast food restaurant?  Disgust the foliage that you were looking at.  Let me explain this.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  All right.  It's not a...  I'm sorry.  It's not a mental illness fucking rant, but it's about...  What I'm saying is...  You're very defensive tonight.  No, I'm not.  I just got to make a decision.  But you gave really bad details.  We had a...  No, I'm finishing...  Let me finish this story.  I had a red tie.  I'm sorry.  No, we're driving back from a gate...  With Bonnie and Lynn.  Actually, with Bonnie and Lynn.  How many audience members were there?  How many... 
[03:18:30]  At the club?  Yeah, how were the chicken fingers?  I mean, while you're at detail...  Go ahead.  Were you a feature?  Is it a feature?  What was it again?  A special event?  Were you a special event?  That's going to make me laugh.  I do real love in fucking Harrisburg.  A regular ticket is $14, but you were a special event, so they had to pay $15?  That was in Allentown.  Oh, my God.  But to further out west of Pennsylvania, I go, my price goes up.  Nice.  All right, go ahead.  And so we were driving, and we're discussing...  I don't think celebrities should get preferential treatment at times. 
[03:19:00]  You know, they get away with a lot of stuff because of who they are.  They walk in...  And I go, I think it's...  We were talking about, what's his name?  Alec Baldwin, when he was smashing his daughter.  That whole thing.  And I go, you know, there was no backlash, this and that.  There should have been.  What do you mean there was no backlash?  Well, whatever.  There should have been.  It was a private conversation.  He was yelling at his daughter.  Well, everything is private.  Everything...  That's supposed to...  Because everything...  Alec Baldwin got smashed.  Everything about Tiger is private.  Exactly.  Everything about everything is private.  I agree.  Okay, everything.  Every news story should be private. 
[03:19:30]  Do President Clinton should be private?  No, you're wrong.  You're wrong.  Why?  Because Alec Baldwin is an actor who we pay to act.  Uh-huh.  So, his private life has nothing to do with his ability to do his job or what we pay him for.  An elected official...  But that's not true because Alec Baldwin is very outspoken when it comes to politics.  So...  An elected official has a response...  An elected official can fucking influence my life or your life by policy.  And by being an elected official, you open your life up to public scrutiny, whereas being 
[03:20:00]  an actor or a golf player, I don't think you do.  No, but that's bullshit, too, because when you're a celebrity or an actor, you do open  up your life or else you wouldn't want to try to get into all these magazines to advance  your career.  You wouldn't have your publicist call the star or whatever, us magazines, say, hey, he'll  be eating lunch here just to...  They want to be in the public eye.  That's what advances their career.  But not being judged on things that most of us do.  You're going to lose this argument.  No, us magazines. 
[03:20:30]  You're going to lose this argument.  I'll tell you why.  You're wrong.  You're going to be the judge?  I'll tell you why.  I'm the judge.  Whatever those magazines are, sell millions of copies talking about celebrities' lives,  not about their audition, not about their next role, about their personal life.  Okay?  Millions of dollars are made on it.  And those actors want to get in those magazines.  You said backlash, Rich.  Like, there should be a backlash for Alec Baldwin yelling at his kid when almost everybody  who has a kid has blown up at the kid, especially going through a horrible divorce that he went 
[03:21:00]  through.  Okay.  So he should basically be penalized for behaving in a way that, let's just say, everyone of  us, the collective us, hold on, I'll let you talk, Tiger Woods, yeah, he cheated on his  wife, as do many men.  Okay.  He's not a child balester.  He wasn't fucking an animal or doing something that none of us can understand or that goes  against all bounds of decency.  He was behaving in a way that a tremendous amount of high-profile athletes behave. 
[03:21:30]  It certainly was not affecting his work or his ability to perform.  Wrong.  Golf?  He's the greatest ever.  It has affected the way he works.  Did he, do you see what he did in the fucking Masters?  It does affect.  You see, last year, he didn't win a major.  That's not because of that.  He came in fourth place in the Masters.  That's a good position, man.  If he didn't make the cut, then I would say it affected his job.  You don't think if you're deceiving your wife and everybody in life, it's affecting your  career.  It's definitely character.  That was true.  Really?  So how come Mickey Mantle was able to hit home runs? 
[03:22:00]  Nobody knew he was a drunk.  Why was Joe DiMaggio...  You're going against your argument.  No, I'm not.  I'm saying it doesn't affect their fucking job.  It's fine.  Yes, it does.  If you saw last week sex addiction affects the way you act, it's going to affect the way  you perform.  It didn't apparently affect because there are people called functional alcoholics.  What I said is his addictive behavior was because he was reckless having sex without  condoms.  He's married.  So where's your fine lines wrong where it affects what your career is?  We don't pay him to be a good husband.  We pay him to play golf. 
[03:22:30]  What he does in his personal life is his fucking business.  I'm a Jimmy.  How did it affect his...  I didn't say it wasn't.  How did it affect his golf, though?  Wait a second.  How did it affect his golf?  I was wrong about saying backlash.  I was wrong about that.  But their personal life is what fucking sells tickets.  Maybe...  It's what sells tickets.  Oh, no, it's not.  You don't think so?  I don't give a fuck...  Why do you think they want to try to get in all those fucking magazines and get on the fucking  GMZ?  I'll tell you how.  What sells tickets is that we like what they do. 
[03:23:00]  What keeps them in the forefront of people's minds is them showing up in other places.  Good and bad.  Sometimes negative works for them, too.  What I'm saying is to be penalized for behavior.  Okay, I was talking about saying backlash.  Or anything.  Like, let's be honest.  All of us.  It's a reflection on what a disgusting, phony country we are.  Of course, we're fucking superficial.  Like, but why is their privacy less valuable than yours?  Or, like, for real, like, we joke about our sexual stuff.  Yeah.  But, like, there's certain private things that you'll discuss with your wife or Opie Will 
[03:23:30]  or I'll talk about with my chick that you don't want people to know.  And all of a sudden, if someone's got a hold of that tape and played it, you want to be  judged on that by a bunch of people who do the exact same fucking thing.  But certain people are hypocrites, too.  I'm not saying alcohol.  I'm saying certain people are fucking hypocrites will go out and preach against this, preach  against that, and do the exact opposite.  Okay?  So, you know, politicians.  Sure.  You know, so...  I don't mind that stuff being exposed. 
[03:24:00]  Okay, so...  Okay, so only with a politician.  Say, say, let's say Janine Garof.  Let's use her as an example.  She's very, very liberal.  Right.  And very, you know...  Outspoken.  She's outspoken, yes.  Very outspoken.  Sure.  Okay.  Now, say she does something.  Like, say she's on 24, probably the most racially profiling show on television.  Okay.  Should she be called out on a hypocrisy about somebody she preaches against?  Yes.  Okay.  Now, I agree with you. 
[03:24:30]  However, Tiger Woods was not preaching celibacy.  I didn't say...  I'm using your argument.  Alec Baldwin talks about politics, but as far as I know, he has never said parents shouldn't  yell at their kids.  If Alec Baldwin had been on the soapbox about parenting and how you should always just talk  to your child...  Okay.  Then that came out.  Then, to me, that's a hypocrisy that should be weighed.  You go, you know what?  This guy's full of shit.  Good point, Rich.  But, okay...  No, but I'm making good points for you.  You're not.  I'm saying... 
[03:25:00]  Okay.  How are they hypocrites?  No.  How is Alec or Tiger hypocrites?  I didn't say Tiger.  I never once said Tiger, but I'm...  You mentioned Tiger.  Yeah, you brought a Tiger.  You mentioned...  I mean, you said Tiger is not...  It doesn't hurt his performance, which you don't fucking know that.  All I know is...  Wait, wait, wait.  That's where I want to jump in for a second.  You said it didn't affect his performance.  It does.  Was he supposed to win a lot more torments when he was being a sex addict?  Well, if it...  No, addiction, any type...  He was banging all these bras.  Okay, wait a second.  He was shooting heroin, not addiction. 
[03:25:30]  Do you think that would affect his performance?  We both know the difference between shooting...  It's a terrible example.  Okay, do you think...  Do you think any addiction, not the physical, the mental addiction...  I don't know how his performance...  I don't know.  It certainly didn't make Richard Pryor less of a comedian.  Oh, come on.  No, you can't compare it.  Yeah.  That's not a...  No.  Why?  Why?  Because...  You're saying mental.  Because...  No, you're right.  A mental addiction.  No, you don't...  You're twisting it.  No, I'm not.  He really isn't, Rich.  No. 
[03:26:00]  Stop.  Here's what you did.  One thing at a time.  You're really...  Yeah.  I said addiction.  Addiction.  How does it affect Tiger's performance?  I don't know.  Okay, here.  I'll tell you now.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I honestly don't know how it affects his performance.  All I know is the results are the guy wins a lot.  He's heralded as the greatest golfer alive or one of them.  So it's obviously not negatively affecting him enough for it to be an issue.  And then you said to me, what about the mental?  And I'm saying, okay, if we're going to talk about the mental, well, then I mentioned 
[03:26:30]  somebody else where the mental counts.  It didn't affect Carlin when he was doing it.  So maybe it didn't...  I can't judge Tiger's mental because I can only raise other examples of guys who are addicts  and it didn't hurt their mental.  Okay.  Here's...  Okay.  What I was saying is, when I said heroin, you can't compare that because the physical,  of course, is going to affect him.  Sure.  So addiction is mental, obviously, you know.  Yes.  Okay, it's mental.  So what's going on in Tiger's mind mentally with his addiction, mentally, you don't think 
[03:27:00]  that can affect him putting in front of the fucking country in front of the gallery?  Can I jump in now?  You don't think that could affect...  Rich, could it?  Could it affect him?  Yes or no?  So are you saying, because when he was winning a lot of those golf tournaments, he was a  sex addict banging broads all over the country.  So to follow your logic here, was he supposed to win even more tournaments than he did?  I don't know, but I'm...  That's the question.  Here's the bottom line.  Because it's hard to say...  Hold on, hold on.  It's hard to say that it affected his playing because he won a shitload. 
[03:27:30]  Okay, here's what I'm saying.  But I'm keeping an open mind wondering, was he supposed to win even more tournaments than  he did?  I don't know.  All right.  Maybe it calmed him down in some weird way.  Hold on, hold on.  Where he's banging broads and he does have this thing in his head all the time, pussy,  pussy, pussy.  So he gets his fucking rocks off and now maybe he is calm enough now to play the sport that  he's great at.  Okay, what I'm saying...  It could go either way.  It could go either way.  Okay, here's the bottom line.  Addiction affects every aspect of your life. 
[03:28:00]  Yes.  Okay, whether you're a doctor, a golfer, a fucking plumber, it doesn't matter.  It affects every...  Every walks and affects every part of your life.  What's that got to do with...  This is my question.  Okay, I was wrong about Al Ball in the backlash.  Okay, but even Tiger.  Okay.  The guy behaves in a way that a lot of men do.  And there's a lot of very successful men, executives, actors, politicians, who succeed while doing  what he did, which is fucking different women on the side. 
[03:28:30]  In some ways, maybe Ope was right.  You know what?  Maybe the idea of being married was frustrating to him.  And maybe this made him feel like, you know what?  I am still alive.  And who the fuck knows?  But it certainly is something we all get.  So a lot of us succeed with that addiction.  Sex addiction is a bad example of hurting your success.  I raised it as a mental obsession because I'm like, why would you risk a billion dollars  in a divorce coming back with herpes or AIDS or anything else you can get?  That's what I meant by that.  He doesn't hurt us, but how about... 
[03:29:00]  No.  Listen, I really don't give a fuck about it, but if you're a sponsor spending $10 million,  $50 million, you're supposed to paint a picture, an image.  Then how about being consistent?  And how about...  This is what bothered me.  The executives in charge of those companies who are paying this guy, I guarantee you a  good percentage of them behave the exact same way he does.  And that's what bothers me.  But those guys aren't in front of the camera. 
[03:29:30]  It doesn't matter.  Yes, it does.  And they're not getting a $100 million fucking deal.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  How could you judge somebody else for doing the same thing you do?  Like, for instance, Tiger's job is if you work hard, if you practice, if you become  great, you can be the greatest for something.  That's what Tiger's message is.  He's a black guy who's called the best golfer ever.  That's inspirational.  The fact that he fucks a lot of girls is going to ruin that.  Not to me, it doesn't.  No, not to me either.  But that's not his message.  That's his message once he takes $100 million to be a spokesman for something. 
[03:30:00]  Okay, then you're in a whole other thing.  And it's the same with you.  If you go into a club, all right, and say the club's saying, I'm going to give you $100,000  tonight, but you've got to do your set this way.  Okay, you agree to it.  And the club owners in the back cursing, doing exactly what he told you not to do, that's  not the deal.  You're right.  Just like if Tiger all of a sudden stops playing golf properly, that's not the deal.  I'm paid to be a good comic.  He's paid to be a great golfer. 
[03:30:30]  If all of a sudden I do the set they tell me to do, and I do well, and then they find  out that I was fucking, I was fucking a waitress, or not a club employee, an audience member  in the thing, and they have a problem with that because I'm married, then they're minding  my fucking business.  If that affects their money, if it affects, listen, you know it's all money.  If it affects their money, then it is their fucking business.  If they're paying you, it affects their fucking business.  It's all bullshit.  And I don't even know if he was a sex addict. 
[03:31:00]  I don't know.  I think he was.  You think he was?  I do.  Just because of the chances he was taking with the no condoms and all?  Because of the crazy risks, yeah.  And I think the compulsion of it, like I definitely think it was probably making his personal life  very unmanageable.  But again, I don't know what it did to him professionally.  I'm a sex addict.  I know how it's hurt my career creatively, but I don't know what it does to a golfer.  I don't play golf.  I just don't know.  I just feel like that he didn't have a chance to grow up and do all that naturally.  It finally came out, you know, later on in his life. 
[03:31:30]  He didn't get a chance to really fucking date a lot of women and stuff.  He was too busy fucking hitting a thousand fucking shots every day.  But once a celebrity, Lindsay Lohan and fucking Paris, they made a career out of throwing  their fucking personal life.  If it wasn't for people knowing about their personal life, they wouldn't have a fucking  career.  But they're not people who are paid to perform a certain way.  Like, to me, that is what they do.  They contribute nothing.  At this point, that's why they're famous.  Especially Paris.  At least Lindsay could think of an actor. 
[03:32:00]  Well, we don't even know that anymore because it's been so long.  She's now just famous for being a fucking loser fucking partier at this point.  Nicole Richie, she contributes nothing.  Paris contributes nothing.  It's all bullshit.  All of us, all these fucking people on TV with no talent, it's fucking ridiculous.  But they do throw their public life, they do throw their lives out there.  So, I'm not saying something like that.  Not to be judged for something that a lot of us understand. 
[03:32:30]  Because, again, there's some big companies.  How many of those big companies are walking away from the Catholic Church because of the  way they behaved?  How many people...  I'd love to know how many of those companies are publicly distancing themselves from the  Catholic Church because of the molestations?  Not many.  Not many because they don't want to backlash one of the Catholics.  So, they're fucking disgusting.  They're all...  Yeah.  Well, again, I don't subscribe to that.  Where did this start, by the way?  He's saying that Alec Baldwin...  I made a mistake.  I mean, I'm saying that's how it started.  Yeah, I corrected it. 
[03:33:00]  But why were we talking about Alec Baldwin?  I was talking about preferential treatment for celebrities.  Oh, this goes...  Back to my radar detector.  Back to...  All right, the radar detector, right.  And whatever.  But it's ridiculous.  I can't get in the text.  All right, so you guys were arguing about the Alec Baldwin situation.  And because of that, you didn't see the cop?  And then I got a...  And then the cop pulls me over.  Oh.  And I started fucking trying to say who I was.  I'm a comic.  Have you ever listened to Obi and Anthony or seen this?  And I try to use my...  I just was talking about how it's fucking disgusting. 
[03:33:30]  See, now it's funny, man.  I got pulled over.  Because you're like, look, I know Alec Baldwin got out of this mess because he's famous.  So, watch me get out of this mess because I'm famous.  Yeah, and I'm fucking...  Did it work?  No, I got the fucking speeding ticket and went out and bought a radar detector the next day.  Okay, now at least we brought it all home.  I was wrong about him.  I was wrong about him.  All right.  There should have been no backlash.  How fast were you?  You have kids.  How fast were you going?  80-something.  And I don't even know if he cut it down to 79 and cut me a break.  Because once it goes over 80, it's a whole other ball game. 
[03:34:00]  Do you know when Tiger should have been held accountable?  If they found out if...  And he was not, apparently, using steroids or something that is considered cheating in golf.  Right.  Then there's a major problem because, to me, then he's breaking his contract because then  it's not just this guy playing golf the way we thought.  What he does off the field is none of our fucking business.  That's not true.  You don't know his contract.  You don't know the stipulations.  They all have morals clauses.  I understand that.  Okay.  But it's despicable.  Okay, then don't sign the fucking contract.  They do check for steroids and all that. 
[03:34:30]  He's making a good point.  They do check for all that stuff in golf.  And if he was caught cheating, then it would be a very different situation.  Listen, I don't care who he does.  All right, so radar detector is your third...  No, that was the fourth.  Fourth?  It was my external hard drive, my golf caddy, my GPS, my radar detector.  A lot of people still have radar detectors?  Yeah, but you know what?  I don't see them as much as I used to.  But it kind of beeps like the last minute or you're...  Yeah, the fucking beep again. 
[03:35:00]  There's no one there and you don't really slow down.  You know, it's like a warning that you want...  It's like when you're doing drugs and everybody tells you not to do them.  Those warnings you really don't care about.  But then when you get that fucking heart attack from the drugs, you're going, that's the warning I'm going to take.  It's like, you know...  So radar detectors are like your parents bothering you.  You know what I'm saying.  Not really.  What's your last tech gadget?  Well, that I like, I don't know how to work it that well.  Bonnie controls it.  But that fucking TiVo is off the hook, man. 
[03:35:30]  I mean, it's been around.  Don't get me wrong.  It's been around.  But TiVo, let me tell you something.  Fast forwarding it through commercials.  Doing what?  Fucking fast forwarding it.  Fast forwarding it.  Fast forwarding.  You know, the whole TiVo...  But your cable system has that.  Here's what I really...  Can you take shows off your cable system?  I don't think so.  I don't know.  What I really was thinking on the other day, I might start to do...  It's pretty much part of your thing now.  I might start to do this, or I might do this. 
[03:36:00]  I bought a new computer for the movie that we don't go online with.  I told you that.  Yeah, I understand that.  Okay.  And it's nice.  It's fast.  It's everything.  It's nice.  My desktop is just a...  No, my...  Yeah, my desktop.  You know, I had it all...  Fucking everything erased out of it just to clear it up and slow it so...  So I was thinking, maybe I might step up and go buy an Apple and a Mac.  But I'm not going to lie.  I'm a little nervous about learning how to do... 
[03:36:30]  You know, because I'm just starting to conquer, you know, cut and paste with my computer and  all that shit.  You do it on Apple.  You do everything on Apple.  Because Apple seems like...  You know, my iPhone...  I got a Mac Pro for Christmas, and I wasn't really doing much Mac stuff before that.  And now I can't...  That's all I use.  Well, I don't know what I would do, but I just...  And I still have a lot to learn, but you pick up a lot of stuff right away.  I just want to learn...  Back up my iPhone onto a computer, and on my other computer, it's too weird and hard, 
[03:37:00]  and you've got to have this and that, and...  What's this and that?  This and that.  What do you need?  What's the this and that you need to back up your iPhone on your regular computer?  I forget the program, what...  Like some cords?  No, no.  The program, it's one of those...  Danny, do you know what he's talking about?  You know the programs you need to back it up on a...  The this and that.  Oh, yeah.  It's real...  Yeah, it's one of those...  You've got to download it because they don't sell it, and it's called iTunes.  No.  No, I have iTunes.  To back it up on your computer, it's got to go through a...  A thing?  Oh, I forget the name. 
[03:37:30]  If you buy a Mac, they have an automatic backup, where they can actually back up to an external  drive.  iTunes is on there, but...  Yeah, but iTunes can back up your iPhone.  What's the...  It does.  Not the phone numbers and stuff.  To back the phone numbers up.  A mobile me?  Mobile me stinks.  To back up your phone numbers and all your...  I hate mobile me.  Contacts.  Contacts and shit.  Information.  It's not on iTunes.  You won't do it on iTunes, Mr. Snooty.  You thought you got me there.  It's not iTunes.  You can't back it up.  Oh, my God.  Don't count standing to text that.  I'm just saying.  I had an old iPhone, right, and then I got a newer iPhone, and all my contacts were saved 
[03:38:00]  and transferred over.  Into iTunes.  Yeah.  I didn't have to sit there and redo each contact on my new phone.  You know, if you redo each contact, you're a boo.  No, I don't.  I...  No, I didn't.  You redo every contact?  Are you talking about Windows contacts?  I didn't redo every contact.  What are you kidding me?  I'd be there all day.  Fuck, I know a lot of people.  No, on iTunes, how...  Where's your fucking phone numbers in iTunes?  Uh, I don't think you could edit in iTunes, but if you back it up, it'll back up all your 
[03:38:30]  contacts and phone numbers. </pre>
