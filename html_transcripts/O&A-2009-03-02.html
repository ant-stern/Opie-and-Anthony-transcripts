<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast featured a segment dominated by Anthony's often vulgar and offensive accounts of his romantic relationships and interactions with his girlfriends' families.  The studio included Opie, Anthony, Joe DeRosa, Patrice O'Neal (and possibly Paul F. Tompkins).  Anthony regaled the listeners with numerous anecdotes, many involving confrontations with disapproving fathers.  One particularly memorable story detailed a father's intense questioning about his relationship with his daughter.  He also vividly described his intense dislike for one girlfriend's mother, going so far as to fantasize about physically assaulting her.  Another anecdote involved his resentment over paying for extensive dental work for his girlfriend's mother.  Further stories recounted past relationships, including incidents of theft (a candle and cash) and one that ended dramatically with a literal fire.  The comedians engaged in a back-and-forth of humorous, and often offensive, banter throughout the segment,  exploring themes of dating, creative (and uncreative) romantic gestures, and the challenges of navigating relationships with significant others and their families.  One particularly humorous, if unsuccessful, romantic gesture recounted was Anthony attempting to woo a woman by walking down the street with a boombox playing "Iron Man." The segment also included a brief advertisement for a comedian's upcoming performance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock job.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, that sounds interesting.  That's got a nice tin can little texture to it.  We had this phone the other day and then there, E-Rock hit something.  Hit himself in the head.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on this beautiful Monday morning. 
[00:00:30]  Ew.  Snowy here in New York.  The whole East Coast.  Yeah, maybe Patrikki's mic could be turned on.  I don't know.  Hello.  There you go.  Look at Stunt Brain.  Look at Stunt Brain.  All retarded.  He's attempting to work the board and it's like watching a monkey on a space shot.  He took a lottery guess for what button to push. 
[00:01:00]  And that one.  Yeah.  I think this might be Patrice.  Is Joe DeRosa's mic on?  I don't think so.  No, of course not.  Why would that one more?  One more button, buddy.  It's the Russian roulette of microphones.  God bless.  Is that?  No, that ain't it.  Is it?  Let's see.  Hello?  There we go.  There's Joe DeRosa.  All right.  All right.  We're all checking in.  Everybody's coming.  Paul F. Tompkins will be in a minute.  Obi's gone.  They made sure of 47 comics here just in case. 
[00:01:30]  I know, right?  Just in case.  I didn't show up.  Norton didn't show up.  Andy didn't show up.  Yeah, a lot of trust they have in me showing up that they just booked 10 comics for the  program.  Obi's in Philly doing some family things, I think.  I think it was the father-in-law's birthday or something.  The big 5-0, which is like two years younger than Opie. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, am I so glad I've never had to deal with a chick's father.  They usually ditch the family when their girls I know are like five.  I thought you'd get to a certain age and you don't even like.  You don't acknowledge anyone?  I give my mother's, my girl's mother, no regard at all.  None.  Like if she didn't like me, I'd be like, really?  Well, hey, things happen.  And that's a mother, you know?  Like the mother sometimes is there, but you don't give a crap about her either.  Who cares?  After you get a certain age, you're like.  Yeah.  I'm too. 
[00:02:30]  And then it's awkward.  But in your situation, I know everybody's parents from now on are like, can I speak to  you for a minute, my daughter?  Excuse me, sir.  Why are you seeing this gentleman?  You're this guy now.  That's what they call you when they get this people.  This guy.  Who's this guy?  Who's this guy?  Anthony's this guy.  That's why I try to find girls with little or no connection to their parents. 
[00:03:00]  The mother's okay because you could really kind of throw her around again.  You just find a low self-esteem circle.  Yeah.  The mother's no good.  The mother's no good.  They don't need that.  The father has been gone forever.  Yeah.  You don't need some father interrogating.  You should be honest.  You need that?  I got the father interrogation once when I was in high school.  And that, well, I was just out of high school, but she was still in high school.  She was like 16. 
[00:03:30]  I guess I was 18 or some crap like that.  And he goes to me.  He goes, I was over the house.  And he goes, let me drive you home.  The father.  The father?  Yeah.  And he was one of these guys who worked for Caterpillar, the big machinery company.  Bill's motorcycle on the weekend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One of those guys.  Mustache.  And just always had this scowl on his face.  Maybe that's all I saw because that's the face he made whenever I came over the house.  Maybe he could have looked like the nicest guy every other time.  And I'm like, yeah, he always seemed to have this scowl on his face. 
[00:04:00]  So he goes, yeah, let me drive you home.  You know?  And I was like, okay.  I sat in the passenger seat of the van and we go driving to my house.  It wasn't that long a drive.  But, man, did he fit a lot of crap in there.  You know, I remember when I was your age and he didn't even try to cut corners or anything.  I knew what girls were all about and what I wanted from them.  And I don't want you.  So what do you think I am?  I'm like, not you.  I'm trying to do that to your daughter.  And?  Yeah.  You're the sorry son of a bitch that had a daughter. 
[00:04:30]  All of a sudden, I have to consider my morals.  But you never did.  I'm going to smash your daughter as soon as I turn your back.  Exactly.  And then just say sir at the end to make her feel better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How could a guy that was doing that during his youth give me any crap about it?  Well, you know, maybe he was a stiff during his youth.  That's the thing.  Don't you always assume that the girl's dad was a turd when he was growing up?  Yeah, yeah.  And wasn't a dirtball like he. 
[00:05:00]  You know what I mean?  I don't mean turd like dirtball turd.  I mean like lame.  Like just kind of a lame, yeah.  Do you know what I mean?  Yee me.  Yeah, some kind of a lame, just not fun.  I can't even imagine.  Stick in the mud.  I can't even imagine what that line of questioning would be for you now.  Like, what's with this Brie Olsen?  Just write the parents a check.  Listen.  How much for this little delicious thing called your daughter? 
[00:05:30]  How much for the girl?  Yeah, you got to do a Blues Brothers.  That was great.  For the little girl.  Or Waterworld.  All right, 45 minutes with the wee one.  That's my all for now.  Oh, no.  All right, man.  How are you?  Get in.  Oh, get in.  Oh, get in.  You got it.  Paper.  Paper.  Paper.  45 minutes with the wee one.  Oh, you're an alien giver.  You can't do it.  You can't do it.  I have to do it.  You got to go to parents. 
[00:06:00]  You got to go to parents the way Puff Daddy had to go to Biggie's mom.  Right, right.  Miss, your daughter has a gift.  I really believe in her.  I'm going to take her.  All the respect.  Just trust me, please.  Blah, blah, blah.  And all that.  But then they give you that speech, and then he dropped me off.  And I was the most, like, just wishy-washy, walk-right-over-me piece-of-crap kid at that point.  Right.  So I was just like, yeah, okay. 
[00:06:30]  I sat there.  My body language said, beat me up.  Just verbally beat me.  I sat with my hands clenched between my knees, my shoulders real tight into my head, and I couldn't even look them in the eye.  And now I would just kind of sit there and go, you're joking, right?  Would you really do that?  I swear.  You know why?  I'm the most, like, jaded, sarcastic douche now that I don't even care.  Like, fathers now, the last girlfriend, her father, it was like, all right, shut up, you hippie. 
[00:07:00]  You were probably older than him.  Yeah, exactly.  Probably.  What are you kidding?  You would look stupid pretending not to want to do what you want to do now.  Yeah, yeah, it would look stupid.  You're too grown of a man to pretend that I'm not going to try to sleep with your daughter if I'm with her.  You know what I mean?  And they'd be too stupid to think I'm not trying to.  Exactly.  So you go, look, I'm going to treat her nice.  Yeah.  I'm with her.  She's with me.  What are you about?  I'll treat her nice.  I'm with her.  Just a high school guy that's going to take a McDonald's and some friggin' Dodge Dart.  What do I make this out there? 
[00:07:30]  A company or a personal?  Yeah, what is this one?  Mr. Johnson?  Of course.  I will have to inform you this is taxable to you because I will need the deduction.  Make it out to cash it in the memo for your daughter.  I'm going to talk about this on the air, so it is a business expense.  Your daughter is a business expense, like my computer equipment.  I want to get to the point where I can just sit a girl's dad down like I'm the wolf and just be like,  Yeah, right.  Can you afford oak? 
[00:08:00]  Well, your Uncle Joey can.  And just start peeling bills off.  They're just happy you're treating it.  By a certain age, though, they're just happy if their daughter's happy.  I'd rather just not have to deal with the parents.  I don't want to deal with it.  How can you say that?  The last girlfriend I had, Melinda, her mother, I had to put a goddamn smile on my face every time 
[00:08:30]  just to be nice for the girlfriend's sake because we were together for quite a few years at that point.  And I hated her.  I hated her mother.  I used to fantasize.  We'd be out to, like, I don't know, the Cheesecake Factory or having lunch somewhere.  The big old Cheesecake Factory.  Oh, yeah.  Big old Cheesecake Factory.  That's the big one.  Yeah.  Guess what this week is. 
[00:09:00]  It's the Cheesecake Factory.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, there you go.  You rub your hands together.  Usually it's Fridays.  Or Chili's.  Last week was California Pizza Kitchen.  Yeah.  And now we're going to slide in.  And then I'd have to listen to some Mr. Haney money-making scheme that she'd have.  Well, Anthony, if you think I'm looking into going into real estate, all right, what are you going to do?  Well, I'm going to take houses and I'm going to buy them. 
[00:09:30]  I was watching this Chinese fellow last night about 1 a.m., and he said I could flip my house.  That's what it is.  He's talking about flipping houses.  I'll flip you.  Oh, so I'd be watching her, like, eat, and I'd actually have a fantasy that would go through my head, and I'm not even kidding about this.  I'd be like, I have the power right now, the physical power, no one could stop me, to lean over and right-hand cross this bitch right in the mouth. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  Just to see that surprise look like, oh, my God, this guy just punched me.  Right.  And brought, like, I know her jaw would snap, like, to the side, and she'd go, ah, ah, ah, and fall off the chair.  And I just would fantasize about punching her in the face.  I hated her.  All of her real estate dreams would just be shattered there at the table.  All those dreams, yeah.  The image of my check being written over to her.  I bought that bitch a mouthful of teeth. 
[00:10:30]  I bought her, and then I wanted to knock her out in the Cheesecake Factory.  Her teeth were so, like, I couldn't even, if she ever came to New York, it was like, oh, I'd like to, you know, meet your mother and Sal and stuff.  And, you know, my mother and Sal aren't the queen in knight in shining armor or anything, but, you know, I couldn't bring this woman around with these friggin' black crayons as teeth.  Were they rotted?  Oh, whichever ones were left, they were, like, friggin', like a hick, like some kind of hillbilly choppers. 
[00:11:00]  How much did they cause?  So I go, I go, you know something?  I go, if your mom's going to be around, I go, maybe, and then this was it.  Oh, you said this to your girl, like your mom's teeth is foul.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  I said, let's look into seeing what it would take.  That's how it started.  We'll look into seeing what it would take to get her some choppers.  To vals her up. 
[00:11:30]  Next thing I know, she's already at the dentist and I'm getting bills sent to me.  Ooh.  So who was you mad at?  Was you mad at your girl?  I was mad at everybody.  I was mad at the dentist.  But whose responsibility?  It should have been me to say, you know, what the hell's going on.  So you could have not paid that bill?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So who'd you curse out, though?  I cursed out.  Like if I said to my girl, check on your mother, you know, I don't, her feet are all weird.  There's some special shoes. 
[00:12:00]  And my girl just said, my girl just got her mother her special shoes and then I got a bill.  Yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't curse her moms out.  It's not a mom.  No, no, I was, no, no.  I was mad at the mother because I knew she was always like this.  The second you make an inkling that you might do something for her, she would just mooch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Schemer.  Yeah.  How many of these little money-making scams that she used to come up with?  Dude, I heard stories about her past history with men and ex-boyfriends and stuff, and 
[00:12:30]  every one of them had seemed to gotten just screwed over by her.  She was living in a house that a guy used to own.  Somehow he lost the house.  She got it.  They weren't even married.  Like off of some kind of weird, like, friggin' carbon copy of a mortgage thing.  And she ends up going, well, goodbye.  Boom, shuts the door.  It's my house now.  I'm like, and I'm, you know, I got to watch my ass.  You know, I got to watch my ass.  What did the teeth end up?  Because you weren't a daughter.  What did the teeth end up running you? 
[00:13:00]  I'm curious to know.  The teeth over the course of the, I think, eight months or so that it was going over was  probably close to 20 grand.  Oh, my God.  Oh, mouth.  I, I, what, I, I, and then all I wanted to do was knock them right out of her face.  Did they affect her breath at all?  The teeth being bad, or you didn't notice?  I never got that close.  What did mother look like?  I mean, other than the teeth.  Let me think.  Something from Lord of the Rings and not one of the people. 
[00:13:30]  It was like some kind of a troll.  Jesus.  Looks like a troll.  Kind of a body that you can't really get a grasp of.  I think she had scoliosis.  Oh, Jesus.  So it was kind of bent up.  I thought I was a bridge.  Yeah.  Oh.  You, do you have a good relationship with any of your girlfriend?  Is there any that you still like go, hey, you, is all your relationship in, in a, just  a tower inferno?  It is literally the last one, yes, ended in fire. 
[00:14:00]  Well, we know that one, but it's like, what, do you have any that you still go, hey, what's  up, you know, or they call you and go, I miss you or something, anything?  No, there is occasional communication with Melinda, text-wise and stuff like that.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, how are you?  It's like kind of a, do you still have that table in the garage kind of a thing?  It's cordial now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's no reason to be, you know.  God, listen, don't, did you see your face?  I know we're on radio, but he looked like, as if, yeah, there's no reason. 
[00:14:30]  No, it wasn't her.  You just said her mother had garbage mouth.  I hated her mother.  She knew I hated her mother.  But you don't hate Melinda anymore.  No, no, I never, I never did hate her.  It was, she was never like one of these vindictive bitches like I had gone out with every other  time in my life, where they all ended up with them just being pieces of crap.  Which girl was, because I'm new, which girl was Melinda?  Was that the last girl you dated?  That was the one I was with for like seven, eight years. 
[00:15:00]  No, the last one was the stupid traffic girl from 10-11.  That one didn't work out very well either.  That one ended with the blonde girl inside her clothes being burnt in a fire pit.  I like how there's zero, that's the one, that's the girl in the closet, girl.  Zero anonymity either.  So that's why she's here so early?  Because she's scared to be by herself?  I thought it was.  No, she's not scared to be by herself.  She doesn't know what old weather broad was going to come in and try to shoot her in the face. 
[00:15:30]  She knows how to cock a shotgun.  Do you leave this one in the house by herself?  Yeah, yeah.  Do you?  Yeah.  You are a trusting ass.  She ain't going to do anything.  What's she going to do?  She going to go for your stuff?  Do you move your...  I got nothing.  When I'm dating a girl, I actually take my cash.  If she sees where my cash is, I'll actually put it in another drawer because I'm afraid  that she's going to start stealing my cash.  You know what you got to do?  See, that's stupid.  Here's what you do.  You take your bulk of your cash that you have around your house, and I have a little safe. 
[00:16:00]  So I put it in the safe.  And then you leave some out, but you know exactly how much and where it is.  And if that's gone, then so is the bitch.  Yeah, but you know what I always did?  I used to leave stuff hoping that they would steal it so that I would never have to be really  committed to them.  I can always keep them as a side broad because she's a thief.  A thief.  I left stuff around to steal.  Yeah, that's what you got to do.  I agree, Patrice.  That's an excellent tactic. 
[00:16:30]  Just let her hang herself.  Yeah, just so she's like, where's this going?  It's going the same place as my watch you stole.  That you stole for your pimp.  That's what I get for making a prostitute my girlfriend.  Thank you.  You know what's hilarious?  My buddy, I had a buddy over at the house one night with my ex-girlfriend.  It was the three of us.  And we were all really drunk.  And he stole a candle out of my house just to see if he could do it, right? 
[00:17:00]  So the candle was gone, and I accused my girlfriend of stealing it because it couldn't even fathom  that my friend would have done it as a goof.  And I called her.  I was like, did you steal that candle that you really like?  She's like, why would you accuse me of that?  I don't understand.  Accuse me of stealing.  I was like, just dirty candles, you whore.  We know how you would have gotten it out of the house.  Where are you going to put it?  There could have been two stolen at once.  A candle seems like something that's so, like, cheesy. 
[00:17:30]  That would almost be like, you could almost rationalize that, like, she wants something  to remember you by and look at it at night.  She would talk about this candle like it was a gold brick or something.  Really?  She'd be like, you know, these candles cost $30, and oh, my God.  And she would light it every time she was over.  So when it disappeared, I was like, this chick, she stole the candle.  Why don't you take the candle?  No, I wanted it.  Screw her.  You wanted to take it.  That makes, would have made some points, though. 
[00:18:00]  It's like, how you take the candle?  I gave enough points in that relationship.  Bought enough milkshakes with two straws in them to carry me.  Yeah.  I didn't mean, I don't know, you know.  The amount of stuff I've given away to women.  Did you ever do that where, you know, you're dating a girl.  You'll, like, buy a DVD.  She'll be like, I love this movie.  You'll be like, I'll buy it.  Like, I bought Christmas Vacation so we could watch that at Christmas.  Yeah.  And then after we watched, I'm like, just take it.  Go ahead.  And that's the stuff that hurts the most after. 
[00:18:30]  When you're like, I gave her my stuff.  Why did I give her that?  I gave her stuff that was mine.  You, like, just because I was weak.  Exactly.  Because I was weak.  It just drives me crazy.  I gave, like, some girl got my, I had a little video camera before the flip cams came out  and stuff that we got now.  Right.  I had a little video camera with a flip out screen and everything.  It was pretty small.  But I was taking video with it.  And some girl that I was with was like, oh, wow, that's really nice.  Let me see.  So she's taking video. 
[00:19:00]  And then I was just like, you want it?  Just like weak.  Will this, like, help me?  You like me more?  Yeah.  That's what you're saying.  Yeah.  I know.  Ew.  I gave her.  You want it?  Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  These two bitches.  I hope you're not one too.  Jimmy's worse.  Shut up.  I only said that with herpes.  I hope you want it.  You want it?  You got it.  You got it anyway.  Take it.  You're the one.  Sorry.  I never walked down the street with a boombox playing Iron Man. 
[00:19:30]  I'm not saying I wasn't a zero, but I'm a little, you know, now I wouldn't.  No, I wouldn't do that like now.  It was a while ago.  Yeah, here's Jimmy walking down the street with a boombox playing this in front of this  chick's house.  I was 15 years old.  I know, but you still did the same douche you were when you were 15 in some ways.  You didn't say anything with Iron Man?  He just thought that she would see him walking by and think, wow, he's Iron Man.  Oh, what a high school roar. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, in your eyes.  With his not one tattoo because of skin disorders, so you couldn't have the needles going in  without causing some problems.  Get an infection.  Some kind of stab infection.  So he's like, all his tattoos would press on from the Cracker Jack Bronx Prize.  What happened with this?  What happened with this weed check?  I never asked her.  I asked her out once on the phone, and she said no.  With a wife beating, and one side of it was hanging off his shoulders and couldn't sit 
[00:20:30]  up on it.  When you asked her out, did she say, are you the psycho that walks up and down the street  with Iron Man?  She was very nice.  She was like the hot chick.  And I'm like, I said, you don't want to go out with me, do you?  And she was like, no.  And I tried to be funny, and I said, oh, that's the way the cookie bounces.  I did.  Shut up.  One of those moments.  How embarrassing, man. 
[00:21:00]  It's awful to tell it now.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm uncomfortable now.  Why are there things like that that stick out from junior high and high school that you  did to get girls that just, to this day, it's so embarrassing being shot down.  You just, because in high, you just don't have that depression blanket yet to go wrap  your, like, if I get shot down now, I'm like, who cares?  Who needs you?  You scuds.  I'll go watch my plasma screen and order Chinese food.  I don't need anybody.  You know what I mean?  It is way before you learn that women aren't us, and the stuff you, like, that's why I 
[00:21:30]  think all romance that guys have is made up from what we think girls want, because I  used to draw, like I said, I don't know what I said, but I used to draw, remember Rebus's?  You ever know Rebus where if you said, I cherish you?  What's Rebus?  It's, you use pictures as the words, so if I said, I cherish, I would say, I would draw 
[00:22:00]  an eyeball, and then I would draw a chair plus the word ish, or if I won't believe.  It's the name concentration.  It's the name concentration, right?  You should have drawn a little bit of condensation on the end of a blade of grass, and then shbag  after it.  Oh my God! 
[00:22:30]  And it just was, it just would be the same reaction, just look down and go, mm, mm, mm,  mm.  I cherish it.  And you thought you were being, you thought you were being so, like, what, endearing to  her?  Creative.  This is another thing I know.  I want to have money for the rest of my life, because I don't want to have to be creative.  Yeah, yeah.  Only broke guys have to be creative.  Hey, I'm going to make you a, I'm going to make you a card.  It's going to be, I cut a lot of, I'm going to make an origami swan with a nickel inside 
[00:23:00]  and an eye heart you, like, I don't want to be creative no more.  You don't have to do that.  I want to go to K's Jewel.  I want to, I want my lower level creativity to be a K's Jeweler, Diane Ladd, special design  heart pendant for some idiot girl.  But other than that, to create my, to pour my heart out, to say this is how I feel about  you, phooey.  Oh, when you're broke, here's a moldy record I found at a flea market.  It made me think of you. 
[00:23:30]  It was 75 cents.  It's so special, though.  I remember you were telling me how much, for some reason, old rice made you feel good.  So here's, I found some old rice for you.  And you're like, just like, oh, yeah, yeah.  Those moments are exposing.  That's why they're embarrassing.  They're like, they're different than just like, yeah, you know, I picked up, I asked a  girl out and she, you know, she told me to drop dead as an adult.  When you're a kid and you do something like that, it's like, you're exposed.  It's like, this is who I am.  Hi.  And they're like, it's exposing on a weird level.  It's such a huge buildup to that asking point that when you're shot down, it's such a huge 
[00:24:00]  letdown.  Like, you think for days and weeks on end, you're looking at the girl going, I got to  get the right move.  You're telling your friends, you're saying, what's going to go on?  And then all of a sudden, you're just like, all right, I built up the nerve to do this.  And then you get shot down.  And all those weeks of work and hoping and fantasies just go down the crapper.  No, because you have no concept of what it, like Patricia was saying, you have no concept  of what it really is when you're a kid. 
[00:24:30]  You have this idealistic idea of romance.  I remember I had a friend, she was my best friend in high school, and I was in love with  her.  And in my head, I was like, well, we have to get married.  She's my best girlfriend.  This is meant to be.  I wrote her a two-page love letter.  What a chump, dude.  No good could come of that.  I got out of work.  I worked at this movie theater, and I called her, and I'm like, hey, I know it's late,  but I have to see you right now.  Can I come over?  You know, did you have the same size head in school?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:25:00]  Still my awful gawky body.  My head hung two feet lower than my shoulders.  And I drove to her house, you know, all just the melodrama in the world, and gave her the  letter and made her read it in front of me.  Oh, yeah.  And she read the whole thing, and she goes, I'm so touched by this.  And this is, I feel closer to you than I've ever felt to anybody.  But.  And the but came, and she just let me down, and two weeks later, she started dating my  best friend. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, yeah, just to rub it in.  It was the biggest.  I thought she was your best friend, stupid.  My best guy friend.  Best friend with a vagina.  Just we were all best friends.  Yeah.  They were.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  As he smashed it.  Right behind the sheriff's office.  Mr. Mayberry.  Yeah.  While the friend was banging her, he could hear, like, what's that crinkle?  As her ass went on the letter here.  We got to take a break.  I hate breaks.  Yeah, they stink.  I don't, I'm not break guy. 
[00:26:00]  I'm fun guy.  No, you gotta, we gotta, uh, take a break.  But, uh, I know, I know Yemi's got, uh, something to plug.  Oh, uh, just San Francisco this weekend.  Oh!  March 6th through 8th, I'll be in, uh, Cobbs, San Francisco.  Yeah.  It's gonna be fun.  Big event.  And we'll get to you guys in, uh, a little later.
