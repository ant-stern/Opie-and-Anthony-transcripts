<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a technical difficulty – a malfunctioning microphone – which the hosts addressed on-air.  They then launched into a rapid-fire discussion covering a wide range of topics.  The Terry Schiavo case was briefly mentioned.  The hosts excitedly anticipated upcoming interviews with George Carlin and John Waters, reminiscing about a previous awkward encounter with Carlin.  Robert Chambers' recent drug arrest, involving a substantial amount of cocaine, was discussed.  The California wildfires prompted speculation about potential terrorism,  with the hosts expressing concern for celebrities like Britney Spears and, with hostility stemming from a past experience, Jane Seymour, who was evacuating.  The hosts repeatedly played clips of Marie Osmond fainting on *Dancing with the Stars*, finding the incident hilarious, and similarly reacted to footage of a family fainting on *Extreme Makeover: Home Edition*.

The hosts expressed extreme anger and used highly offensive language ("wussy boy") towards WISP, their Philadelphia radio station,  detailing their dissatisfaction with management and plans to leave.  They were buoyed by supportive calls from Philadelphia listeners, contrasting this negative experience with their generally positive relationships with other stations.  Throughout the show, they promoted a thousand-dollar listener contest, with one listener, Stewie, winning $1000.  The hosts initially found humorous a monkey attack on a New Delhi deputy mayor, but their amusement quickly subsided upon learning of the mayor's death, leading to a discussion on the challenges of a "global community."  They also speculated, in a crude and humorous manner, on the cause of Jill Nicolini's injury.

The show continued with a discussion of a mayor's death after a monkey attack, followed by broader commentary on animal dangers, including bees, piranhas, and aggressive small fish.  This transitioned into a humorous discussion on the unpleasant aspects of fish and a tangent about an overcrowded fish tank in a massage parlor. Fear of water and diving into deep water was also explored.  A caller, Peter from San Diego, gave a live wildfire update, highlighting the unusual lack of smoke. The hosts discussed people's fascination with disasters when not directly affected.  The conversation shifted to sports, specifically the Indianapolis Colts' success and predictions for a Patriots game.

Jill Nicolini herself called in to discuss breaking her ankle exiting her car, with the hosts playfully speculating on the incident’s true cause.  This led to a discussion of her show's "Dance Friday" segment, with E-Rock slated to fill in.  They bantered about E-Rock’s appearance and his upcoming performance.  A segment mocking exaggerated Halloween safety tips and focusing on humorous, offensive jokes about sex offenders and Halloween candy followed.  This was followed by "80s New Wave Tuesday."

The remainder of the show consisted primarily of interviews with George Carlin and John Waters.  The interview with Carlin covered his 50-year career, changes in radio, the state of American society, the absurdity of modern news, and the increasing censorship and political correctness.  Carlin shared anecdotes about audience reactions and offered humorous observations on societal norms and beliefs, alongside off-color humor with the hosts.  Topics included beheadings, the banning of Harry Potter books, the normalization of tragedies (Titanic and 9/11), the Taco Bell World Series promotion, an Alaskan woman finding a corpse in a freezer, Paul McCartney's album title, and a panda biting a zoo intruder.  John Waters joined the conversation, discussing his eclectic career. Carlin mentioned his past television show and his dislike of Hollywood, and the interview concluded with promotion of his new DVD set.

The segment with John Waters, who was a studio guest, covered film remakes (including *The Three Stooges*), shoplifting anecdotes, his views on art and taboo subjects, and his experiences with "sexploitation" films.  Discussions included the definition of art,  an anecdote about an adult baby on a previous show,  the ethics of using animals sexually (spurred by a documentary about a "sex farm"), and his one-man show, "This Filthy World."  The segment also featured graphic descriptions of pinworms and impetigo, discussions of public restroom behavior and sexual acts, Larry Craig’s arrest, and preferences in romantic partners,  all alongside vulgar and offensive language.

A later segment featured John Waters discussing *Donnie Darko*, Marlon Brando’s acting style and on-set behavior, and his film *Pecker*, which prompted a lengthy discussion on various topics including hygiene and public masturbation.  A female caller initiated this digression.  Waters expressed his relative conservatism on violence and exploitation, and the hosts promoted his DVD, *This Filthy World*.  A call from pilot Lee Abrams followed, with conversations about flying,  Nigerian scammers, the hosts’ opinions on various bands (Yes, Fleetwood Mac, Rush), and a humorous dance lesson for E-Rock.

The final segment featured Lee Abrams discussing a celebrity fainting on television, a false report about Van Halen cancelling their tour, an XM employee’s enthusiastic reaction to Chicago’s music, speculation on drug use references in Chicago’s songs, a recording of Van Halen playing out of tune, their opinions on the POTUS, George Carlin’s comedic style, and Abrams’s career in radio, including a past encounter with Carlin.  The hosts discussed their new studio, job security, and concluded with a “line of the day” segment and a sarcastic assessment of the show by Lee Abrams.

[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I go into her room and there are panties on the floor.  Oh, you're getting creepy.  I had to pick up the panties and put them on.  I can't believe he said that.  Opie and Anthony.  Cat shovel baseball!  Oh, nice!  I didn't hit him hard enough 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony  Terry Schiavo  I loved you in the grudge  Will you be doing more voiceover work?  This is the worst  The worst show I've  This is the worst show I've ever been on  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  This music means showtime 
[00:01:30]  It's showtime  Good morning, kiddies  Hi  My mic wants to just turn completely around

Yes  John Waters over at XM  The legendary  George Carlin  Yeah, Carlin's coming in  And John Waters  8 o'clock  Yeah  Yeah 
[00:04:00]  That was good  Like, last time we talked to George Carlin  Was, uh  How many years ago was that?  Uh, has to be like five  About five years ago  Maybe six years ago  And we had a good time and everything  But it was a little weird  Like, it was a weird vibe  Not because of him or anything  I think because he's just such a  Legend in, in comedy  That it was kind of hard to  To talk to him  Was it after  Especially at the time too  Because it wasn't  He's, he's ahead of the curve  On everything  Yeah  So he was talking about stuff 
[00:04:30]  That is commonplace now  With the censorship  And political correctness  And all this  And he was talking about it then  When we were getting away with murder  On the radio  And, uh  It was a little odd  Talking to him  But now I really want to just  Get into his head  And see what the hell he thinks  About all this crap  I'm sure he's got a lot to say  Celebrating 50 years  Of doing comedy  Isn't that amazing?  50 years  Yeah  It's amazing how most guys  Started with like  I don't know why I'm saying things  I should be saying to him  I'll wait till he's here  Because here's what I'm gonna do  I'm excited  So I'm gonna  I'm just gonna blow it right now 
[00:05:00]  And I'm gonna say things  And he's gonna walk in  And I'm just gonna look at him  And go  That's Carlin  He's sitting right there  He's sitting  Every once in a while  Someone comes through here  Where you're just starstruck  You're like  Wow  That's  Wow  That's George Carlin  Yeah  He's one of those guys  Doesn't happen often  But it's gonna happen today  We'll do  We'll be  We'll be fine with that  Yeah  I've been showing old news clips  I mean today  It's Robert Chambers  The preppy  The preppy killer  Whose head is giant now  Yeah  He looks like John Kerry  Yeah  He's got like a big long head 
[00:05:30]  I don't know  Prison didn't suit him very well  Yeah  The preppy murderer  Well they arrested him  For dealing coke  Out of his east side  Apartment  That's what you should do  Like lots of coke  They said so much coke  That it could levitate  Central Park  That's what he should do  That's what the paper  Was saying today  There was so much coke  Being sold by this dope  What an idiot  He spent 15 years in jail  He gets out  What  Three years ago  And now they're saying  If these charges stick 
[00:06:00]  Bye bye forever  So long  Yeah  To Robert Chambers  The preppy killer  How old is he  He's like probably 41 maybe  Or 40 years old  Somewhere in there  Yeah  Maybe early 40s sure  If he lives to be 77 years old  He could have had another 37 years  Without being in jail  What a dummy  Adult  What are you doing  I guess when the cops finally showed  Like the residents of the building  They all said  Or a few of them said  You're here for floor 17 right  Oh wow  Like the drug trafficking  Was so obvious  I mean he's such a high profile guy 
[00:06:30]  You would think  If you are gonna go that route  You might want to find  An abandoned building somewhere  And like drop the shoe box down  Maybe hire some people too  Right right  Not be the guy  Right  So that's the big story in New York  The preppy killer  Arrested on drug charges  Selling out of his apartment  And it's not looking good  For Mr. Chambers  He actually kills a girl  Goes to prison for it  Gets out  And screws up  But it's just 
[00:07:00]  He's like a really big  A nice apartment apparently  He was trying to fund that  I guess  Just behave yourself  No that's not true either  No?  No his girlfriend  Inherited the apartment  From somebody  Oh okay  So he has nothing to do  With that apartment  His long time girlfriend  And that's her apartment  That she inherited  He moved in there  It's a really nice  One bedroom  I just read the whole article  Sorry  I just didn't want  To give all the details  I thought you just  Knew all about this  No I just  Just give him the bullet points  Because I think that's about 
[00:07:30]  What anyone cares about  And also  The terrorists are  Burning California  I'm telling you  I'm telling you  There's terrorists involved  Now you brought this up  Quite a while ago  These huge forest fires  And big  Tall grass fires  That happen  In the Midwest  And in California  They just seem to happen  And Ope says  I think it's terrorism  Because wouldn't it be easy  For these guys  To just go out  Throw some matches around 
[00:08:00]  Start these big fires  And everyone laughed  But I've heard this  Come up now  It is coming up  Yeah people are starting  To think  Not so much in this country  And other countries  They were starting  To say that terrorism  Terrorists are starting  To start fires  And why wouldn't  They do it here  It's probably the easiest  Thing to do  And not get caught doing  Well if you've ever  Driven around like California  They're paranoid  Of a cigarette butt  They're paranoid of a  There's signs  That say don't throw  Cigarettes out  Right  They're paranoid of a match  One lousy match  Yeah  So why wouldn't 
[00:08:30]  The terrorists get together  And just throw  Seven or eight  Freaking cigarette butts around  Yeah  And it's in an area  Where there's no  Surveillance cameras  Or on a dirt road somewhere  And then you got  Those winds out there  The Santa Ana winds  That's a perfect recipe  For disaster  And what  They evacuate  250,000 people  In San Diego alone  The San Diego area  Yes  Driving in  Tragically  I heard they actually  Evacuated a Dr. Quinn  Medicine woman  Oh really  Yeah  You know what  I hope her  I hope her house 
[00:09:00]  Burns down to the ground  I'm still holding a grudge  I was just a little kid  I was going to  Where was I going  Phil Donahue or something  To a Phil Donahue taping  And my mom  Who was starstruck by her  What's her name  Yeah  What's her name  She's on  Jane Seymour  Jane Seymour  And my mom  Big Jane Seymour fan  Asked for a picture  And right in the elevator  In front of a bunch of people  Said no to my mom  And as a little kid  I never forgot that  So I hope her freaking house  Burns down to the ground 
[00:09:30]  I hope  Big Jane Seymour fan  I hope it even burns  The basement  Wait  She said just no  She just flat out said no  And then we all  We're all awkwardly  In the elevator together  Waiting to get off the elevator  She'd love that  About now  Jane Seymour  After  Take pictures of her  Want to take a picture with her  Nowadays  She'd love it  Yeah  Yeah this was back  Probably before even  Dr. Quinn I think  I don't know  I'd sit there  If I was a firefighter  With a hose  Just barely dripping water  And go  Picture  Right right 
[00:10:00]  Before you turn it on  And put her house out  And then they had  Some dope on Larry King  Last night  Talking about how  She might  That was Larry King  Oh  How she might lose her house  That country singer  What was it  Tanya Tucker  Tanya Tucker  Who was it  Last night  On Larry King  And they're  They're watching  As she's getting updates  Every hour  Not sure if her  Multi-million dollar  Beachfront mansion  Is gonna survive  And I'm just sitting there  Like god  I hope it burns  I hope it all burns  Nothing 
[00:10:30]  Burn burn burn  Burn baby  There's nothing better  Than those flames  That are about  50 feet high  And some dork  On his roof  With a garden hose  Yeah  Like wetting his shingles  Like that's gonna stop it  Like 50 yards away  Are 50 foot flames  Just tearing towards your house  And you're going  Oh  I might need another hose  I'm not leaving  Yeah  Awful  And then you use your hose  Until the fire takes out  The water supply  Or  Yeah  Or melts your hose  Melts your hose  And then you're just sitting there  With the end of it 
[00:11:00]  With no water coming out  A bucket  Just trying to throw it  On your siding  Right  As it melts  That's the price you pay  You do pay a price  Wherever you live  And California  It's all about  Earthquakes and fires  Midwest we all know  The tornado  Just rips your house apart  Hurricanes  On the east coast  Especially the southeast  Up here  What really rips houses apart  Up here  Home invasions  Yeah  I think that's pretty much  What you have to worry about 
[00:11:30]  And planes crashing  Into buildings  Ah  That's true too  You gotta watch out  Living in the pinnacle  Of the free world  Although it's not happening  As much as like tornadoes  But still  Yeah  You know  It happens once  It's enough to scare  The crap out of you  For generations to come  Yeah  So  And then you can live  In other places  But it's either  800 below zero  Or 6,000 degrees  Yeah  But there you go  A bunch of people  On instant feedback  Opie the terrorist  Are burning California  I'm telling you  Yep  I'm telling you  I have no doubt  In my mind  That something's going on 
[00:12:00]  I wonder if they'll find out  About that  How many fires they got  Like a dozen  Oh yeah  And then you got the winds  And it's  Burning like crazy  It's burning Malibu  I mean I was watching  Some of those  Those TMZ  The Insider meets  Entertainment Tonight  Meets X17  Meets Perez Hilton  Slash dot com show  And they're watching  Britney's house too  You know  Britney Spears  Might be in danger  Of losing her house as well  I learned that yesterday  You know  There's a massive war going on 
[00:12:30]  It's pretty much like  The beginning of World War 3  But let's worry about  The Malibu fires  And make sure Britney Spears  You know  Her house is safe  Her house is okay  But her Starbucks wasn't safe  Like they had to close yesterday  Britney Spears  The place she goes for coffee  That's where she goes  Like every day  Where people  The paparazzi  Take pictures of her  They had to lock their door  So there was a little bit of  There was a little bit of tragedy there  They had to figure out  Where Britney was going to go  For her coffee yesterday  You know what kills me too  These people report this

[00:24:00]  I certainly would have liked to have heard from  The people in charge  I love Philly  I love the people of Philly  I love doing radio  I love doing radio for Philly  I just don't love WISP  I want the guy to pick up my phone  We're on a lot of radio stations for CBS  And it's no way to treat us  Simple as that  I could understand if it was like an independent company  With one lousy station that we were on 
[00:24:30]  Then I would sort of get it  But we're a big part of this radio company  And they're treating us like crap  And we sit here and take it  I don't need them  We don't need them  And I'm sure we can find another home in Philly  Might take a little while  But I'm willing to take the chance  WISP's a disaster  I don't know why the guy hasn't given us a call  And all we asked was for the PD to call us  He said he was gonna call us  He said he was gonna keep in touch with us  I don't think he likes us 
[00:25:00]  Well then say it  Then say it  Stop being a little  You know  You know what  We can't say half the words I want to call him  Wussy boy  Be a man  And tell us what's going on  Nothing  Said he was gonna  Said he was gonna call  Don't come up to New York  And sit across the table from us  And say how great we are  And you're big fans  And looking forward to working with us  And all this stuff  And then  And then what?  And then you go away  And we never hear from you?  Yeah  That's not a man  That's a wussy boy 
[00:25:30]  John Cook's a wussy boy  This is a very good radio show  And we'll do just fine  Working for somebody else in Philly  I like it  I have no doubt in my mind  And don't be confused  We love Philly  I go down there all the time  The show goes down there all the time  You know  Don't be confused  I don't love YSP anymore  And most people don't at this point  The place is a freaking disaster  Thank you Sean 
[00:26:00]  See we get nothing but calls from Philly  It seems every morning  Sean what's up?  Yeah what's up guys  Listen  I've been listening to you guys  For the last six, seven years  Straight out of YSP  You know  And I'll give them that  Because they turn me on to you guys  But when you guys went on hiatus  I was like  I was so happy that you went to XM  Picked up the XM  I've listened to that ever since  So screw YSP  I mean listen  It's a fair way  There's everyone else in Philly  And you're true fans  Of which you  No matter what 
[00:26:30]  And I just want to say thanks  I listen to you guys  Every morning going into work  I decompose on the way home  From work  And it's just  You guys are the best  I just want to say thanks  I appreciate it  And we got a doozy  For YSP  When this all finally  You know  Goes down  And this is me talking  I'm not talking for Ann  I'm not talking for Jimmy  You know  I have a problem  Running my mouth  But I'm not going to sit here  And be like  Oh I don't know  What's going to happen  In Philly  I don't know  If they want us anymore  Well screw with YSP  F them in their F 
[00:27:00]  You know what  Well said  Someone gave me a note  Want to try to get  Cook on the phone  He's already decided  He doesn't want to talk to us  After he came all the way up  To New York  With the GM  And sat across the table  From us  Said they're going back to rock  Said that we're a huge part  Of the whole thing  That we're going to be their anchor  Their morning show  Can't wait  This is going to be exciting  This is going to be good for you guys  John Cook's sitting there going  I'm going to send you guys  So many emails 
[00:27:30]  You're going to call me  And go please stop  Just please stop  And I'm like no  That's exactly what we want  Maybe someone called him  And he thought it was us  And said please stop  Right  And he just stopped completely  You know we have a very good relationship  With all the PD's  From not all  But most of them  I mean West Palm Beach  Is a very similar situation  They don't want to  You know they don't want to show  And they don't want to communicate with us  But that's been going on  For over a year  Oh my god yeah  I'm amazed we're still on  In West Palm Beach  I think it's hysterical 
[00:28:00]  But you know what  I respect the guy  In West Palm Beach  I really do  And I'll tell you why  He made his intentions known  From day one  When we started talking  To all the PD's  And they like  Came back with all their research  About the Opie and Anthony show  In their market  It was nothing but positive  Except for West Palm Beach  He wasn't digging the show  Didn't want the show  And made it very obvious  From day one  I respect that  Believe it or not  At least we know  Where we're at  Yeah  I don't respect guys  That sit across the table from you  And look you right in the eyes 
[00:28:30]  And say that they're big fans  And you know  Looking forward to working with you  And you're the anchor  Of YSP  When we bring the rock back  And all that  Lying right to our face  Obviously  Because we went down there  A mere what  Three four days later  We were there for two days  And then never heard  From the people again  I don't respect that  Whatsoever  I think that's a  That's a wussy boy  Rings of phoniness  That's a wussy boy  That's not a man  So I do respect  The West Palm Beach guy  Believe it or not  You know 
[00:29:00]  It's unfortunate  He doesn't want to  Work the show or anything  But he basically told us  From day one  Look  Company forced us  To take the show  We don't want the show  We want to kind of  Have our own thing  Going down here  We want a local show  I respect that  At least I knew  Where the guy was standing  When we went down there  He made it perfectly obvious  That he was doing the basics  Like oh you're here  Well here's some coffee  And donuts  Do the show  You know  We'll give you  Like a dressing room  At the big concert  We're doing down here  But look  You know  You know what's going on  I know what's going on 
[00:29:30]  I respect that  Believe it or not  In my life  You know  I don't respect people  That lie right to your face  And I'm not going to sit here  And like wonder  Because it's a major  Distraction  You know  I'm speaking for myself  YSP  The people running it right now  It blows  It blows  It just makes me sad  Because it was such a big part  Of you know  The whole syndication thing  And I'm talking the old days  Yeah  With Philly  Well the people that really believed in the show 
[00:30:00]  Have moved on  And you know  They proved that this show  Is just  Is just  It was told to us  Actually at the roast  Tim Sabian came by  And said hi to us  He goes  You know  CBS doesn't understand  That your show is  Lightning in a bottle  Obviously Tim Sabian  Where there's lightning in the bottle  Things a little  But you know  The point  The point is made though  He's a douche in trousers  He goes  The new people at  YSP  And some of the people in the company  They don't understand  What they got with your show  They don't understand  That you can't just  Push a switch in the morning 
[00:30:30]  Turn on the syndicated morning show  And that's it  You gotta work it  You gotta make it part of your station  You gotta make it part of your city  It's gotta be promoted  We're not talking about billboards  And things like that  It's just making it an integral part  Of the station  Through  On air promos  Things like that  Dude  Gotta work it  Back in the day  YSP  They got in our face  All the time  To the point  A lot of people in Philly  Really believed  That we were broadcasting live from Philly  Remember they would just come up with 
[00:31:00]  Cheese steaks  Out of nowhere  Like just to get the attention  They knew how to work the show  You know  What about some  Like production  When was the last time  We went into a studio  And read like  Hey  It's Opie and Anthony  We do production  For almost every other station  That we're on  Yeah  Almost every other station  You know  We don't get asked by YSP  We don't get  We don't get copy  Sent over here  That says  Hey guys  Do a few things  For the station 
[00:31:30]  Right  Nothing  Well  There you go  I want to make it perfectly clear  We love Philly  We love doing radio in Philly  I don't like YSP  I don't like how they've treated us  Especially knowing that  We're a huge part of this radio company  We're on in a lot of cities  And to be treated like this  By the local guys in Philly  Is just  Just wrong  And they're not men  They're not men whatsoever  You know  You cannot truly be a man  Well  That's the way it is 
[00:32:00]  With corporate people  They just say one thing  And then they just kind of hide  Until it just goes away  Well  You know  That's fine  But I'm not going to sit here  And take it  We'll find another radio station  We'll find another company  There's other radio companies  Out there too  You know  I'm not going to give up  You're right Jimmy  But I'm not giving up on that crap  I want to find a station  That gets the show  Knows how to work the show  I want to find a  You know  A company that will help us out  A little bit more  In the end as well  You know  Philly 
[00:32:30]  Let's go to Alex  Alex what's up  Hey what's up guys  Hey  Hey little Jimmy  Hey buddy  Yeah man  I can't believe you guys  Are going off in Philly  Is that like set or what  I think it's set  You know  But these  These wussy boys down there  You know  One day  They'll  We'll just not be on  And that's how  They're going to handle it  Really  Yeah  Well you still haven't  Talked to the PD  Have you  No  No I haven't talked to him  Since we  Since the virus show  When was that  That was early September 
[00:33:00]  Wasn't it  Gone back  And he said he was going to call  That's the weird thing  He said he was going to call  And he's just hiding  Like a little wussy boy  This John Cook  Yeah  Little wussy boy  You've sat right across  From us up here in New York  You're a wussy boy  If you didn't  Really  If you didn't want the show  You had an opportunity  You were right in front of us  Right in front of us  I don't  I personally don't want to listen  To Preston and Steve  Well  Well 
[00:33:30]  They're horrible  I'll probably just  I'll probably just drive to work  With my radio off  Well they're  You're a silly sir  Do that  Don't even turn your car on  Yeah  Yeah  Just roll it down a hill  Start the car in your garage  In honor of us  Leaving the Philly radio  There you go  I will  Alright Alex  Alright guys  Take it easy  Let's say hi to Mike in Pennsylvania  Mike what's up  What's going on guys  How's your guys morning going  Doesn't sound too hot man  No we're  What  I hear you guys are possibly

[00:34:30]  Dave Douglas  Yeah you might want to look up  His career after he did us wrong  And see how that worked out for him  Yeah that never works out well  In the end  Dave Douglas was programming  A business stock ticker radio station  That's how bad it got for Dave Douglas  Yep  After he did us wrong  Yeah he did a radio station  That just was an audible  Audio stock ticker  It was a business station  It was just  Yeah it was just stock talk  Wow wow wow wow wow  Why would he dump out of that 
[00:35:00]  A guy saying he was going to get  XM  Why would you do it  I'm going to dump out of that too  Why?  Because they don't  They don't want to promote it  They don't want to promote it  It's just the way it is  Good morning everybody  There you go  That's what I do today  I stir  You  Oh  I stir stuff up  That's what I do today  That was good  And I do have a doozy waiting  Just a big doozy 
[00:35:30]  A lolo  Alright getting back to Marie Osmond  That's our little rant for today  And every day we'll rant about Philly  And tell people how much YSP just sucks  For what they're doing to us  Proving they're just wussy boys  And not men  Marie Osmond faints on Dance with the Stars  I want to play the clip again  So listen  Now that we know she like passed out  You'll hear the panting  She's panting like crazy  Yeah  Like ask her if she's okay  And like you said  Like everyone is so self-absorbed 
[00:36:00]  Yeah  Like you know  The Simon Cowell guy  Character  Character on this show  Is just wants to get his lines out  Yeah that's all he wants to do  Is get his lines out  He's not concerned at all  That she's breathing abnormally  The video is pretty funny  Because her eyes are pretty much like  Like slot machines  Yeah  And he's like  And you know  The technique in your dance  Was quite important  Not easy  Let's go to our heads  Listen to the panther 
[00:36:30]  What did you think  Well you know  For the amateur dancer  For me  This dance  The samba  Is the hardest one to master  I agree  There's lots of different rhythms  Going on  You have to do steps  On the spot  You have to move  Around the floor  You've got to get this  Elusive bounce action going  And of course  You've got to show  The gaiety  And the fun  Of the samba  All right we're going to take  A commercial break  We'll be right back  And we'll be right back 
[00:37:00]  After this  Am I like wrong  For thinking that  They should have stayed live  Like is my brain messed up  I know it's messed up  They just smack her in the face  A few times  Throw some water on her  But what would it hurt  To play that out live on TV  I know  What would it hurt  We play out horrific things  On TV all the time  Yeah  Reality programming  It's supposed to be  And they know you're coming back though  Yeah well that's true  You're going to sit through  Those commercials  Yeah but  By the time they got back 
[00:37:30]  From commercials and stuff  She was you know  She was fine  Like why not play that moment out  Because it wasn't time  For a commercial break  Is it live though  Yeah it was live last night  Yeah  This was live  This was live  Voting crap  So they get back  Live  They get back from commercial  And this is what happened  That you don't plan those things  I once in a while  That happens to me  When I get winded  And I stop breathing  I'm so sorry  Well you look  I'm really sorry  You know I guess he's right  I am sleeping beauty  Huh  Sleeping on the job

[00:38:30]  A little breathing  Who needs it  Be great if that happened  While she was singing  I'm a little bit country  I'm a little bit rough  Donny Osmond was really cool  Because he's singing about rock and roll  Yeah  Yeah he was the cool one  There was nothing to rock and roll  About him  He was as rock and roll  As Dan  Hansen  All right  And then finally  Well you gotta have an apology  For whatever reason  I don't know  Well she might have offended 
[00:39:00]  Fainting Americans  I have no idea  Right  Someone's offended by her  Are the fainting Americans  Protesting  Yeah  And getting  Fainting Mormons  Getting Reverend Al Sharpton  Behind them  For a march  A march on Washington  Where they all faint  Once in a while  That happens to me  When I get winded  And I stop breathing  I'm so sorry  I'm really sorry  You know  She hyperventilated  Obviously  Yeah  Yeah  You know  I don't think she stopped breathing  No  She's got too much  I'm really sorry  You know

[00:40:30]  And it was to silence  Nobody applauded  First of all  That's not the place  Where you want to watch  Some kind of a stupid  Dancing act  On the plane  You're miserable  It's a long delay  A woman who everybody hates  Stop  And a 10 hour delay  And the captain probably blew it  He goes  We have a special treat  So everybody's probably  Like free booze  Yeah  Free airline tickets

[00:46:00]  I submit to you  No  The best one  Yet  Are you  You got the  Same one  I got  Dan's got  Headphones on  Go ahead  It was the one  They were just  Showing  That reporter  Was reporting  From his house  Burning down  Yeah  Oh no  They finally did it  They actually had  A reporter  Reporting on his  House being  Destroyed by the  Fires  How great is that  So he was like  Here's my house  Burning down  This ass  I  You know something  Reporting from his 
[00:46:30]  Own house as it's  Burning down  You had better  Gotten  Everything out of  That house  Before you  Call up your  Your news department  And say  Get a truck down  Here  Yeah  I really want to  Report on this  It better just be  An empty frame  Of a house  Yeah  And there's my  Wife in the  Living room  Yeah  She seems to  Need some help  Isn't that amazing  Oh  They love becoming  Part of the story now  And by the way  George Carlin coming in  I read a  Old article from 
[00:47:00]  George Carlin  That Lee Abrams  Who's a bore  He really is  He's a bore on the  Radio but he's a  Terrific guy and  Really knows this  Business  He writes well  And he's a good  Pilot from what I  Hear but as far as  Talking  Wow  Talking on the  Radio  I can't figure out  How to get some  Of these amazing  Things that he has  Going on in his  Brain on the  Radio that's the  Problem  You know it's  It's better that  You read Lee  Abrams thoughts  Than have him  Actually say him  On the show  But he sent me  An article that  George Carlin did  About local news 
[00:47:30]  That is just  Brilliant and I  Really want to get  Into that with  George Carlin when  He comes in here  Right on the  Money  And we're on the  Same page basically  Saying how the  News is not the  News anymore  And he's got  He's got some  Great observations  About that  Hopefully he'll get  Into that when he  Comes in at 8 o'clock  News attainment  Yeah  Well South Carolina  You know these fires  Out of control in  California  South Carolina  I looked on a map  It's right next to  California so there  Should be some kind  Of worry there  Right  South Carolina 
[00:48:00]  And California  Yeah I looked on a  Map  That's why they're  Doing this story  I'm about to play  For you because  South Carolina is  Right next to  California and  The fire will just  Jump over to the  Next state which is  South Carolina right  Yeah I  All right  That would be the  Only reason they do  This but these  Oh god let me just  Play it  Gotta make it  Local huh  Yeah the South  Carolina making the  Fires in California  Please google map 
[00:48:30]  Today  Making it local  To South Carolina  How do you do  That  It is hard to  Imagine when you  Look at the pictures  Of what's going on  In California that  Similar fires could  Happen here but they  Could  News 10's Maggie  Alexander found out  Tonight the dry  Conditions that are  Causing such destruction  In California are  Similar to the ones  In South Carolina  Chief Daryl Jones  At South Carolina  Forestry Commission  In Columbia has  Been tracking this  Computer closely  The flames mark  All the forest fires 
[00:49:00]  Burning across the  State and recently  Jones has seen  More fire than  Usual  And over the  Weekend we had  29 wildfires in  The state over  100 acres burned  In the last three  Or four months  Since July we've  Had above normal  Fire activity  They should all  Die screaming  They should  I've been through  South Carolina a  Couple times  A couple  Is this really a  Problem down there  Not as bad as  California that  California this  Happens every year 
[00:49:30]  Every year there's  Out of control fires  But this one looks  Like a biggie  Like a biggie  But they had to go  Local and then  Scare the crap out of  Everybody in South  Carolina that it  Could happen there  Why not  The peak fire  Season in South  Carolina isn't  Until February  But what's  Happening now is  Laying the ground  Work for the  Spring fire season  We don't see any  Projected precipitation  Coming any time  Between now and  Say our spring fire  Season which is in  February, March and  April so we  Expect it to be a  Busy season we  Expect maybe more 
[00:50:00]  Than average  The only thing that  Would extinguish the  Problem rain which  Isn't forecasted soon  That's causing  Concern for people  Like Jones  We have to worry  About the safety  Of our guys in  The woods so it's  Really scary when  You don't think  There's going to  Be rain coming  Anytime soon  So there you go  South Carolina is  Going to burn  According to that  Yeah well they  Got they got a lot  Of drought down  There hasn't rained  In a while but I  Mean to try to  Equate it to what's  Going on in  California is a  Little much and

Bajwa  Bajwa was attacked  By monkeys  On Saturday  While he was  Peter Tork  Should anyone  Did Peter Tork  Get him  Should anyone  In a civilized  Like city  Although New Delhi 
[00:53:30]  I know  But I mean  Should anyone be  Being attacked  By monkeys  Unless you're  In the middle  Of the rainforest  No  Seriously  Jane Seymour  Never even got  Attacked by monkeys  And she lived  With them  F. Jane Seymour  Turning my mom  Down for a picture  You got me  I'm tired  I meant to say  Jane Goodall  Oh alright  I was wondering  Why  Now you got me  Mad about Jane Seymour  Again  Why else would I  Say her  Unless she was  Brought up today  Jane Goodall  I screwed up

Bajwa  Bajwa was attacked  By monkeys  On Saturday  While he was 
[00:54:30]  Standing in the  Balcony of his house  The balcony  Of their house  And they want  A global community  You would assume  In the balcony  Of your house  You're safe  From monkeys  How are we ever  Going to have  A global community  Really  Wouldn't you see  Them coming  Oh he's like  Scarface  He was like  Shooting at all  The ones in the  Steps  And then one  Big monkey  Shot him  From the back  Didn't see that  Monkey with the  Sunglasses on  The shotgun  How 80's was that  Sunglasses  And an assassination  Hit  We get it  Bajwa  Bajwa was attacked 
[00:55:00]  By monkeys  On Saturday  While he was  Standing in the  Balcony of his house  But he lost  Control and fell  On the ground  Bajwa succumbed  To his injuries  Today  Bajwa's death  Has once again  Brought the monkey  Conflict into focus  Throughout the capital  Stray monkeys  Have spared none  Children  Are soft targets  The MCD has now  Hired monkey catchers  To rid Delhi  Of the menace  I didn't know  He died  From the monkey  Attack  I just thought  He got attacked  By monkeys  And everybody  Was fine  And it was  Kind of a cute 
[00:55:30]  Funny story  No he died  He fell off  The balcony  He was on his  Balcony  Monkeys attacked  Him on his  Balcony  And then he  Died  So he's trying  To fight off  The monkeys  And he fell  Off the balcony  Yeah  Oh my god  That's horrible  You gotta think  Monkeys in New Delhi  Though are like  Rats  Yeah  I hear like  Kangaroos are like  Rats to the Aussies  No I hear most  Aussies  Never see kangaroos  I hear like  But like  We think kangaroos  Are cool  But to them 
[00:56:00]  It's like  They're just a nuisance  And they're like  Rats to us  Here in New York City  It would be like  And I hear the monkeys  Are the same thing  In a lot of these countries  They're just like  Little just rats  To them  We just get  Cats and dogs  Like stray cats  And stray dogs  Around here  Nothing like  The monkey  How many were  Attacking him  That must have  Been a few  Oh would that  Have looked great  Sorry that he's  Dead and all  But boy  To see him  On the balcony  Fighting off monkeys  And then just  Tumbling over the railing  Do you think  As you fall to your death  With monkeys on you  You're thinking  I'm the mayor 
[00:56:30]  I'm the mayor  Damn it  I'm the mayor of this city  And I'm falling  With monkeys on me  And you know those  Just damn super simians  Just got up  And ran away  After they fell  The same distance  The mayor did  Yeah  They fall off the balcony  They just brush it off  Like nothing  They've got springy things  In their ankles  Yeah  They can hit the ground  It doesn't matter  They're not breaking  Their ankle  Getting out of the car  Ever  No  With Jill  Our little monkey  They can step out a window  From ten stories up  They're not breaking 
[00:57:00]  Their ankle  Because they've got  Those springy things  Yeah  They just make a monkey  Noise and run  Some loud stupid monkey  Monkeys just sound dumb  We get it  You're here  Yeah they do that  And then run off  Why would they be on the balcony  Leaving a dead mayor  I don't get it  He probably was out there  Eating something  Like just  Like opens his  I picture a wrought iron balcony  I picture this guy  Opening up some french doors  The curtains  Are a white gauzy material 
[00:57:30]  And they blow out a little bit  And he's got some coffee  And maybe a little Danish  And he's just  Breathing in the air  And thinking  I'm mayor  I'm monkeys  And they just swoop in on him  And grab him  And he punches one  But another one's trying to grab his Danish  He drops the Danish  And now like five monkeys are on him  And he's swinging  And he loses his orientation  And flips backwards over the railing 
[00:58:00]  And just bam  Hits the ground  Dead  And the monkey runs off  With his coffee in Danish  And that's it  And that's it  Dead  Dead I say  How do you get them off you?  You don't  It's not like bees  Where you can put water on you  Bees?  Like if there's bees  I always know if bees attacked me  I would run into the shower  I would turn the shower on real quick  And stand there  And get the bees watching  Are you getting in the house?  You're going into the house  With bees on you?  I'm assuming I'm in the house  And they attack me  Bees are just  A swarm of bees  Probably the most frightening thing to me 
[00:58:30]  Yeah  I am petrified  Because you can't fight them off  What about a pack of monkeys?  Pack of monkeys  Could be a problem  Yeah  Depending on how many  And if you're on a balcony  What about piranha?  Piranha  You're in the water  Once you're in the water  All bets are off  You can't  You can't be afraid of things in the water  And go in the water  So if there's piranha  If you're in the  The Amazon  And you're swimming  And piranha get you  That's your god damn problem  Bees though 
[00:59:00]  There are people  There was a guy  He just opened his garage door  And bees attacked him  He was covered  Head to toe in bees  Stung him to death  Right  He was in a walker  And what do you do?  When bees attack you  There's nothing you can do  You can't roll on the ground like fire  You can't brush them off of you  Can I do a service for everybody  That might be going down to  Atlantis in the Bahamas  Oh  You've been down there recently right?  Yes  And you know that  I've said it before  But I've got to say it again  That man-made lagoon they have  Uh-huh  Man-made lagoon 
[00:59:30]  Right in front of the place  It's beautiful  And you can get a little snorkel  A little flippers  Yep  You can spend an hour in there  And it's pretty deep  The water's like 25 feet deep  And it's crystal clear  There's fishies in there  And I think they put a lot of the fish in there  And then it's attached to the ocean  So some other things will go in there  And it's just a lovely time  Right  Yeah  They have these little yellow effers  They're no bigger than like a  Like a  How big am I going here?  That's pretty big  Big silver dollar 
[01:00:00]  Like a big silver dollar  And they are  They are really good to look at  Very yellow  Very bright  Very vibrant  Mm-hmm  They travel in little  Little packs  Little pods  Little schools  Those effers  Are they fishies?  Those effers  Will bite the crap out of you  Yee  And they're not scared of you  I hate that  So then you spend half your time  Avoiding the cute little  Yellow fish down there  And they just  Nip nip nip nip nip nip nip nip  Nip at your body 
[01:00:30]  Leaving little scars  All over the place  Fish suck  Fish suck  I hate fish  They're great when they're being  Slaughtered for your  Your dining pleasure  Made into cat food  By the way  Jimmy fish can't suck  Sure they can  Their mouths are always doing  That sucking thing  How do you resist?  They  But you can't look  See look  Make a fish thing  It's true  It's like watching a burn victim  Try to suck something  How do you suck  If your lips look like this? 
[01:01:00]  Here's the thing with fish  Oh boy  I go to a massage parlor  And they have a small fish tank  And they have like  Ten giant fish in it  And it's just the most  Uncomfortable thing  I've ever seen in my life  Why?  Because they're just the worst  It's like  Do you people  I mean  There's giant fish  In this little tank  And the fish are miserable  They're literally just like  Looking around like  What do we do?  They're bumping into each other  It's horrendous  Overcrowding  Yeah  Big dumb fish  They swim like  Six inches and stop  And they go  Alright I'm here  I'm here 
[01:01:30]  It's been all day  To get over there  It's been crowded  You've never done any  Scuba diving  Or any of that crap  No  Snorkeling  No  Nothing like that  When you get away  From like the reefs  And stuff  And you just see  These fish in the middle  Of nowhere  You think  Wow  Their lives just suck  They're just food  For something else  There's nothing to see  Hasn't eaten them yet  There's nowhere to go  They're just  Constantly swimming  They can barely rest  Ever  Like their lives  Have got to just suck 
[01:02:00]  The creepiest thing  About snorkeling  Or scuba diving  Is when you reach  An area that isn't  A reef  And it's just flat  And you look off  Into the distance  And it just goes  Into that haze  Of you can't see  Anything  And you're just  Waiting for some  Monster to come  Out of there  And you know  Your eyesight  Is looking pretty much  Hundreds if not  Thousands of miles  Into nothing  Into nothing  And you know  There's big wells  Monsters in the water  And stuff we haven't  Even discovered yet  Just on the other side  Of that darkness 
[01:02:30]  Yep  Too creepy down there  Gotta bring your own  Air with you  Alright  I'm gonna bring  My own air  We should have done  This yesterday  For Pod Talk Monday  But when I go up  To Rochester  I go across  The Great Lakes  To Canada  With Brother Weez  And like we'll stop  In the middle of  The lake  And jump in  No you won't  And the boat's  Just floating  And I don't know  Maybe someone  You know  Could help me out  But I think it drops  Down close to a mile  Or a good 
[01:03:00]  Whatever  After 12 feet  Doesn't really matter  I love people  Go  It drops down  50 feet here  Really  Anything over  I'm just under  Six foot  Anything over  Six foot  Is pretty bad  For me  It might as well  Be a thousand feet  Maybe not  Maybe I could go  Seven feet  Because I think  You can bop up  And down  A few times  Yeah  Keep bopping  Off the floor  Well you don't  Want to touch  The bottom  Yeah true  So creepy  But anyway  This is kind of  Pod talk crap  But we would 
[01:03:30]  Jump in  In the middle  After some wine  Going back to Rochester  After being in Canada  Whatever  We stop right  In the middle of the lake  And it drops  Straight down  And you can't see crap  It is as dark  As can be right  And I just picture  Like we would  Just go head first  And just dive in  And I'm like  How creepy is that  Diving in  Knowing it drops  Who knows  A ridiculous  You know  Thousands of feet  Yeah  And I just picture  Because I'm too scared  To open my eyes  So I just like  Jump in  Quickly  And I just picture  If I open my eyes  There would be this 
[01:04:00]  Just massive  Now I know  It's like fresh water  But just be  You know  Bear with me  Something  The equivalent  Of a whale  Like a foot away  From me  If you open your eyes  That second  It'll be right there  And then you get  That thought  In your head  As you're jumping in  And it's horrifying  It brings you back  To being like  Panicky  Like eight years old  And realizing  You're gonna die  Something  It is horrifying  Because that's  All I can picture  If I open my eyes  There's just gonna be  This massive 
[01:04:30]  Like Loch Ness  Monster thing  I'm on the brink  Of panic  Whenever I'm in  The water  Not a pool  I mean pools  Are fine  But a lake  Or the ocean  And more so  A lake  For some reason  More so a lake  Than the ocean  Like the ocean  Is kind of moving around  You're by the shore  You kind of  You know  Stay in that area  Everyone's there  You're body surfing  Or something  But a lake  Is dark  And murky  And when you're  In the ocean  Stuff you got  An exit strategy  You see where  The shore is  Like a lake 
[01:05:00]  To really enjoy a lake  You gotta kind of  Get out there  A pond  Swim to the platform  Right  No  Oh it's just so creepy  I don't know  I'm not a water person  Don't like it  I just want to see  If E-Rock has any more  Jaws music  For freshwater pond stories  Freshwater pond  Yes  Well hold on  Everything but sharks 
[01:05:30]  He's got  So I was attacked  By a flying thing  Dun dun dun dun dun dun  I was in a car accident  Dun dun dun dun dun  Anything with  What was raining  Jaws music  Quickly kill it  Anything with  Water  Is messing  Hey  There's E-Rock  Hi E-Rock  Hey  How you doing  You guys all ready  To have some fun  Yeah  What is that  It's E-Rock  It kind of sounds  Like E-Rock too  By the way  Yes Jimmy

[01:08:30]  It doesn't make it  Quite that far  So you're right there  In the middle of the action  But there's no smoke  Or fire near you anywhere  Yeah it's like  Thank you for the update  Huh?  Exactly  Close to the fire as we are  Yeah  You're seeing the exact same thing  We're seeing when we look out the window  No smoke  No fire  I think secretly though  Peter wants to be  You know  Close to the fire  Could you just burn your house down?  There's something weird that happens  With human beings  When this crap happens  We get  There's a weird excitement  Yeah 
[01:09:00]  There's just a weird excitement  That happens  When there's a disaster  Close to you  Dude  That's why people love disasters  No matter how horrific  People love talking about them  As long as you're not involved in it  And it's not really directly screwing you up  Or if you survive it  If you're involved in it  Yeah yeah  And you survive it  But you want to feel like  You might be part of it  Yeah  Close to it  But not to the point  Where you're  Getting screwed up  That's what I got here on the TV though  It's been nothing but 24 hour  A day coverage of this 
[01:09:30]  And it just drives you crazy  Because you can't even watch whatever  You know  Because it's just that  And when you guys were talking about  I bet you get cable  Oh yeah  Exactly  I bet you start there  Plenty of things to still watch  Oh yeah  There's plenty to watch  Is MTV doing around the clock coverage?

They had nothing on here  Alright thank you Peter  No problem  Hey have a good day guys  Be good  Fire  The Colts pretty impressive though  For the third year in a row

Yeah  Where is it?  I don't know  Don't people realize  The longer a sport goes on  The more stats are going to be  Like first time ever  This happens and this happens  That's pretty impressive  6-0 three years in a row  Yeah it is  But like  You're not a stat guy? 
[01:10:30]  No I just  It's like alright  They've been playing long enough  Where a lot of these things  Are just going to happen  Well they've been playing long enough  Where they've got to kind of  Come up with new stats  For us to follow  Because they know  Everyone loves stats  And all the biggies are taken already  And kind of not close to  Being broken  Things like that  So you come up with new ones  Well Major League Baseball  Came up with some weird one  About most strikeouts  For a pitcher that has  A pimple on his nose  A whitehead  Baseball is the worst 
[01:11:00]  When it comes to stats  They're just inventing things  They will pull them  Out of anywhere  And just  Yeah it's the first time  That it's happened  In a double header  Where a left-hander  Is going to get  What?  Where the lights flickered  What?  Who cares?  Okay it's  The Colts are at home  When the Pats  And the Colts play  Oh who  Who would you just pick  In that game?  Who would you pick?  You gotta go  You gotta go Pats  Pats?  Yeah  Big upset at home  Against the Colts  Absolutely yeah 
[01:11:30]  Wow  Yeah you gotta go  With the Pats  That's a bold statement  I mean I know  They're you know  6-0 and everything  Dude Brady's insane  He's insane  He threw for six touchdowns  This weekend  And I don't even think  He played the second half  Because it was 42 to  What was it?  42 to 9  At the half  Yeah  And I think he already  Had six touchdowns  For the game  So you're going Pats?  Easily  All right  Brady's unstoppable  This year  Okay I gotta get  To the bank  I gotta take out

[01:14:00]  God bless Barb  She wanted them to know that the team was loved  And that she represented the fans who couldn't stay up  Right  Which apparently was  I don't know what is it  60,000 a game show up  And not one could stay up  Not one works the night shift  Was she killed by monkeys  That would be funny  We know it's gonna take a few more days to get over this  Before she's really stretching this out into a long grief period  Look at least till 6am  We'll all be upset  But everybody in Cleveland knows we love the United  Just drivel  I'm so happy  They must have been like 
[01:14:30]  Just getting off the plane  And looking and going  Oh this is great  One fan  Look not to knock Cleveland  I love Cleveland  But when you think you're going to the World Series  And you realize you're not  And then you land  And it's welcome to Cleveland  You're like  I wouldn't mind if I was going home to LA or something  Yeah they kind of had it in the bag  And oh well  Sox do it again  Go Sox  Yeah I want to see them too  Instead of those dumb Rockies  I don't know anything about the Rockies

[01:23:30]  A great thing  For E-Rocktober  Yeah  It'll be perfect  Alright hey  Speaking of the news  We got this little thing  You know  It's the season  Before you take  The kids trick or treating  This year  You might want to  Check out  Whose door  You're knocking on  In the neighborhood  Authorities tell us  That registered offenders  Can't seek out  Children's Halloween activities  But they're not  Completely barred  From the holiday  Under state  Sex offender statutes  There are no laws  That specifically mention  Holidays like Halloween  According to state police 
[01:24:00]  If your child  Knocks on a sex offender's door  There's nothing  That prohibits  That offender  From answering  And that's why  Local police say  You should visit  The sex offender website  Before you trick or treat  Hello  He doesn't even have to  Use his hands  To open the door  Want a treat?  Just put your hand  Through the mail slot  I'll give you some  Cod liver oil  All over your palm  Give me one case  Of a sex offender  Grabbing your kid 
[01:24:30]  And dragging him  Inside his house  Give me one  On Halloween  One case  The news makes it sound  Like this is some  Crazy epidemic  I'll tell you what happens  The sex offenders  Are smart  They have all the candy  For the trick or treaters  In like a  Pillow case  And they hold it  Really close to their bodies  And they probably  Make the little  Princes and cowboys  Fish in there  For candy  Yeah go ahead  Get a good one  Just rubbing  Like  Just  Just arching himself 
[01:25:00]  Exactly  What a creep  Like they're looking  And they see candy  And yet poking through  They see like a little ghost  Like what is that  It's a ghost  Wearing a Darth Vader helmet  The kids today  Don't even know  What they're missing  With this trick or treating  Yeah  In my building  They have signs up  All over the place  That you know  For Halloween  They're going to be  Trick or treating  In the lobby  Oh is that it  You have to sign up  In your building  In my building  You have to sign up  Yeah sign up  And then  The kids will be  Trick or treating  Around the lobby 
[01:25:30]  So that should be  Fun for everybody  Go from corner  To corner  To corner  To corner  They made it  A little too complicated  Four stops  And safe  And everything  For the kids  Because everyone's paranoid  When nothing happens  Yeah  Statistically  Really nothing happens  I'll bring in my  Culture of Fear book  They did a whole like  I'm scared of that book  They did a whole chapter though  On Halloween  And how this stuff  Just doesn't happen  The razor blades  And the apples  It doesn't happen  No I remember  Because a cousin's  Brother's friend 
[01:26:00]  That happened to  They were able to  Document going back  A few decades  Like three or four kids  That were poisoned  From Halloween candy  And guess what  It was their own families  Poisoning their own kids  To get insurance money  Yeah  They couldn't find one  Where it was some  You know stranger  Poisoning kids with candy  But because of the news  Scaring the crap out  Of all the parents out there  They're not really  Bringing their kids around  To house to house anymore  They get scared  So now it's in a mall  It's in a lobby  Of a building 
[01:26:30]  You know  It's a little Halloween parade  In your little town  Yeah  With thousands of people  It's just  It's too bad  What are some things  Parents can do  To make sure  Their kids don't end up  On the steps  Of a sex offender  Registered sex offender  One of the most  Important things  Is have an adult  Go with the children  When they're trick or treating  And if you can  Go in a group  Their safety in numbers  What are they talking about  Seriously 
[01:27:00]  Safety in numbers  Wait I spent a little time  On this  Safety in numbers  The kids are not  Getting grabbed  While they're trick or treating  It's just not happening  No  So they get these  Dumb experts  On the local news  To just continue  The fear out there  You gotta trick or treat  In numbers  Their safety in numbers  For what  It's their job  To scare us  Like we're over there  In Africa  And they separate the weak  And they drag them  To a watering hole  And  This isn't happening 
[01:27:30]  How do they get away  With this  Their safety in numbers  Before you go out  Explain to your kids  Do not go into  Anyone's house  Do not approach  A stranger's car  If you go along  With that guideline  Also  Plan a route  You know  Have an idea  Of what part  Of the neighborhood  You're going to  Perform your trick or treating  In  And only cross  At the major crosswalks  This guy's awful 
[01:28:00]  Isn't he  He sounds like a ghoul  No kidding  Way to stay away  From him  It's just amazing  Just awful advice  Right  What are some other  Ideas and tips  For parents  To keep their kids safe  And these have to do  It's just so funny  Because the news  Is like well  Halloween time  We gotta do our  Halloween tips  You know  The same ones  Every year  They're just  A bunch of robots  Halloween time  Well Halloween tips  Thanksgiving  Well different ways  To cook your turkey  Yeah  Some people are gonna be  Deep frying the whole thing 
[01:28:30]  But you gotta make sure  You do that far from the house  So you don't burn your house down  Here's your advice  For Halloween  Don't wear blue  In Blood's neighborhoods  And don't wear red  In Crips's neighborhoods  There you go  That's all you need to know  Pretty much it  That's it  There you go  Keep their kids safe  And these have to do more  With probably tripping  On your costume  Or anything like that  Okay well think about it  What you do before  Trick or treating  During the trick or treating  And then after  And before  Check your child's costume  Make sure there's  No parts of the material 
[01:29:00]  That drag to ground  That could cause  Them to trip  When they're crossing the street  If your child's wearing a mask  Make sure they have  Good peripheral vision  You might want to  Think about putting makeup  On their face  Instead of the mask  Make sure that there's  No hole in the back  With an arrow  Pointing down  Predators  Depending on the weather  You might want to  Put clothing under the costume  It's a good idea  To let your child  Carry a flashlight  Or a glow stick  Or maybe have 
[01:29:30]  Some part of their costume  That's reflective  Yeah that goes good  With realism of a costume  Those are some other tips  You can do prior to  Trying to be a princess  And carrying a cop flashlight  Yeah right  That's exactly it  Oh it's just so dumb  Ooh I'm a vampire  Who can't see in the dark  Very well  Yeah like one of those  Things that Voss uses  To read the menu  One of those like  Magnifying glass things  That lights up  You're putting your wallet  If you're over 50  Is he really doing that now?  Of course he is  He should be killed  Hey yeah  We need the help of the listeners

[01:32:30]  Trolling for fish  You son  We want to  Say it to your face  We get  We're fortunate enough  To interview a lot  Of people  With this radio show  And every once in a while  Someone comes through  That door  Where we're like  Starstruck  And a little freaked out  And you're one of those guys  And it's only a handful  Of times this has happened  Over the years  Thank you  Now calm down  Right  We're all obviously  Huge fans  And we love everything  You've done  I really appreciate it  50 years right  50 years since 
[01:33:00]  I went into radio  In 1956  40 was just starting  Rock and roll  Was just starting  I was 18  And I had the advantage  Of having a car  Down in Shreveport  I was in Shreveport, Louisiana  I was in the Air Force  And I could go out  At night  And tell the chick  Hey  You want to hear  A song tomorrow  I'll dedicate it to you  What do you want  You know  It was magic  Magic man  Two paychecks  Didn't have to do anything  On the airbase  Just do my show  Radio's just never changed 
[01:33:30]  As far as that goes  That's why  I think it's a way  To get girls  That's why most people  Got into radio  Was for the free CDs  Well free CDs now  Whatever  Free music  And hopefully  Picking up a few  Extra women on the side  Trade outs  With the sponsors  Right right  Yeah the whole  Plugola  Payola  What was  Radio must have been  A hell of a lot  Different back then  Than it is now  Especially  Did you have freedom  To really talk  And say what you want  You didn't have a  PD up your  It was the first stage 
[01:34:00]  Of top 40  So personalities  Were still in play  And you had a kind  Of a persona  On the air  And they  Set your pictures out  You know  And all that  And I was a young guy  So they wanted  You know  We had a lot  Of young listeners  Naturally  And so they wanted  To have like a fan club  And all that stuff  And yeah  The thing about it was  Our radio station  Was a day timer  Dig this  It was a day timer  That is to say  It went on the air 
[01:34:30]  In the morning  And went off  In sundown  Because that was  The way you did it  Some of them  A thousand watt  And we had to gain  Our audience back  Every morning  And we had a 52  Hooper  In a nine station market  A 52% share  Of the audience  In a nine station  A hot radio market  Shreveport  They had a big CBS station  With Louisiana Hayride  Had a lot of great  Radio stations  And we were number one  But yeah  We had an owner  Who hated rock and roll  But he played it  But he also played 
[01:35:00]  Ray Anthony  And stuff like that  So it was schizophrenic  And you could choose  Everything you wanted  You know  You had the 30  Top 30  You had the newcomers  And then you had oldies  And dusty discs  And all that  But it was up to you  You know  Yes  You can make your own program  You would pick it  And then what about  Like talking between the records  To get some of your personality  In there  It wasn't just time and temperature  And label and artist  Right  It was  You talk about  Whatever you felt like  And you could play around  I used to  Any live spots  I always had fun with them  I would do them 
[01:35:30]  In foreign accents  Or I would do them  As characters  You know  So yeah  It was a lot of freedom  Yeah  Now  It's a business  Which I think  Ope says it a lot  When he got into it even  You know  It was a bunch of guys  Just kind of  Hanging out  Especially FM radio  FM radio  They hired you  Because you smoked pot  No I'm serious  Like the album oriented  Rock stations  In the 70's especially 
[01:36:00]  They hired you  Because you were one of the guys  And you would smoke pot  And play whatever the hell  You wanted  And then someone  Figured out  Whoa we can make money  Off this  That's right  Which turned out  To be a bad thing  In the end  They called it  Underground radio  For a while  Sure  It was underground radio  I used to listen  Old air checks  And you hear these guys  They're completely stoned  Looking out  Looking out  I mean you hear it  On the radio  They're like  I'm just watching  The snow fall  They were just  Completely gone  And this was CMF 
[01:36:30]  I got to listen  To some old air checks  And fast forward  A mere 10-15 years  And there's consultants  And there's PDs  Running in  And the general managers  And it's a whole different  You know  Ball game now  And they test everything  And they send out hooks  They actually have people  Listen to hooks  To see which hooks  They don't bother  With the whole record  You like this whole section  Okay that's a good one  Yeah if you like  Two seconds of this song  Our station's gonna play it  How ridiculous is that  I know  And I was one of the guys  When I first started radio 
[01:37:00]  I was the guy  That had to play this  Little hook  For people at home  While they were trying to eat  Really you did that  I was an intern  And that was my job  Yeah  And I would just  Fudge the results  Because half these people  Would be cursing me out  Saying F you  I'm eating  Don't ever call again  I'm like  Alright they like the song  Is that a yes  Right on the air  So you know  And the consultants  Would take all this research  Seriously  But they would  Give it to interns  To do  Of course they're not  Going to work that hard  At doing that  Well it's just  Another sign  Of the absolute  Disintegration 
[01:37:30]  And decay  Of this country  It's been in its  Death throes  You know  Since World War II  It's on the way  It's going away man  People think  It's going  It's going away  If you can't smell that  If you can't see that  You ain't paying attention man  You've said a lot of things  That have been  Really controversial  With some people  And that's  That's one of them  I happen to agree with you  Yeah  I think we're doomed  As a nation  We're going to go down  In history  As one of those  Empires that kind of  Peaked and then  Kind of went away 
[01:38:00]  Overreached  Yeah  Selfish  Arrogant  Ah  And have  And now we have things like  Tequila lollipops  You know  And I counted  In the car wash  About a couple of years ago  By now  I counted  Of all the ways  You could change  The smell in your car  From things you hang  On the window  To beads  To sprays  To  They had several  Delivery systems  For this stuff  I counted  Over 200  Different things 
[01:38:30]  You could do  To change the smell  In your car  And one of them  Was called  New car smell  And  I mean it's over  It's finished  Take a look  You know  One of my favorite things  Is like as the years  Have gone on  You're less good  At hiding your revulsion  For everything  Which is  Which is so  It's great  Thank you  I love it  As it's gone on  It's just gotten  Like just angrier  And just  Less trying to be  Polite to them  And just  Assaulting the people  That are actually  Sitting in the room 
[01:39:00]  And you know  I want to just  If I may  For a moment  Correct the word  Angry  Even though  It's an understandable  Word to use  When you describe  Some of that stuff  I do  It's really  A disappointment  And a disillusionment  And a contempt  For people  This country  And the human species  Either one you want to take  The American nation  Or the human species  We were given  Great gifts  This mind  This brain  That we have  As humans  And the wonderful gifts  In this country  And we have squandered them  Made all the wrong choices 
[01:39:30]  Organized ourselves poorly  Ourselves poorly  We believe there's an invisible man  In the sky  Who's running things  And all we want  Is the latest gizmo  We want a cell phone  That'll make pancakes  If we can get that  We're going to be fine  And it's just absurd  And what it is  It's a frustration  You know  It's not an anger  You intensify  It on stage  And it reads as anger  I know that  But I don't live  An angry life  And I look at this  And it's an amusement  To me  This big world  This big round globe  Is theater in the round 
[01:40:00]  To me  I'm just here for the show  And you've got an outlet  You can go on a stage  And kind of  Spew what you're seeing  Out there  And we have an outlet  We get to do a radio show  And we point out  A lot of stuff  That's going on  You have the immediacy  Going for you  You can get right on  It the next day  I think I would go insane  If I wasn't able  To just like  Go on the radio  And talk about  All the craziness  That's happening  Around us  I really do  We were talking  About the news  And how it has just  Deteriorated  From  You know  When I was growing up  As a kid 
[01:40:30]  You'd see  Walter Cronkite  On the news  It was a desk  It was a clock  It was Walter  And you pretty much  You pretty much  Believed him  You know  What he was saying  You felt he wasn't  Trying to pull  Something over on you  Whether he was  Getting accurate  Information or not  He was just  Reporting the news  He never got up  And danced  I never saw him  Get up and dance  He never needed  Flashy graphics  And he never  Teased what was  Coming up next  With some kind of 
[01:41:00]  Deadly disease  Or  There's a toy  In your house  That could kill  Your child  Will tell you  About it  In four hours  As your kid  Plays with toys  It's just this  Thing  This business  To get people  To tune in  And keep tuning in  It's an  Entertainment show  I once heard  A 7 o'clock  News  Tease  That said  A prominent  Senator  No it was  During the  Entertainment hours  It was during  Prime time  Like 8.30  Something like that  They said  Prominent senator  Dies  Find out who  At 11

[01:43:30]  Be making you fat  Tomorrow  CBS 2 News  At 5  We collect these  Like baseball cards  They are just  Too much fun  To own  And we take it  And we take it  Very seriously  We debate it  On the air  Should this one  Be in the hall of fame  We're not sure  Yes  You know  It takes a lot  To get to the hall of fame  And the ingredients  And shampoo  That can make a boy  Develop breasts  Tonight at 10  Give it to the girls  Send them to the neighborhood  With the sex predators  The three block radius  Might as well play it out  We got two more  This one  Go go go  Sex offenders 
[01:44:00]  Maybe in your house  In your house  Especially if you're one  And then finally  The problem solvers  Have uncovered  Sexual predators  Sent to live  In our nursing homes  Do you really know  Who's living down the hall  Could this happen  To your mother  Just the thought  You sure  They're not making  Fun of themselves  They gotta be  At this point  Just the thought  Of your mother  Being ravaged  That's pretty much  What they wanted you  To get  Your mom's laying  In a nursing home  Barely breathing 
[01:44:30]  And being ravaged  By some predator  By some predator  That you didn't know  About in the hospital  What a great project  When did it happen  It's like  And I talk about  The downfall  Of the society  The whole time  I'm constantly saying  We're doomed  We're doomed  But I don't know  What did it  Is it the nation  As a whole  With getting greedy  Is it just  The leadership  Is it political correctness  The world just opening up  And getting more info  You know 
[01:45:00]  It used to be  Kind of us against the Soviets  But then when  When information  Started being spread  A little more easily  They kind of figured out  What was going on  I don't know  No  But it's just  It is depressing  And just disappointing  It's kind of entertaining  When you look at it  You know  When you're born  In the world  You're given  A ticket to the freak show  When you're born in America  You're given a front row seat  And some of us  Have notebooks  And that's as simple as that  You and all of us 
[01:45:30]  In this room  We have notebooks  And we make little  Some of the freaks  Are self-appointed  Michael Jackson  Mike Tyson  Certain ones  And other ones  Are thrust into it  Leona Helmsley  You know  It's just an interesting  Thing to watch  I mean  From the standpoint  Of personalities alone  But I don't know  I think it's a cascade  You know  It builds on itself  And they say  Hey  As you say  It reminds me  Of a line from  Firesign Theater  Hey  We can make whiskey 
[01:46:00]  You know  Hey  We can make money  Like you said  Once they find out  There's an extra dollar  Or two to be squeezed out  They do it  Yeah  You have this great  I'm sorry George  You have a great knack  Of taking the way  People are thinking  And just really making you  Doubt your own point of view  Like with voting  It's such a brilliant point  You made  About how people say  Ah you can't complain  If you don't vote  And then you point out  How like  The people that voted  Are the ones that put  These people in office  So you have every right  To complain  Because you're not a part of it  You stayed home that day  Of course I'm complaining  I didn't do this 
[01:46:30]  It wasn't my work  The greatest ability  To narrow everything down  To one simple  Beautiful point  Like anorexia  I think it's probably  My favorite thing  You've ever said  Is anorexia  Rich C's  Don't want to eat  F'em  Yeah  I mean what a beautiful  Accurate thing  I had a friend  In my neighborhood  Jack Heaney  We call him Billy Heaney  He was Bill John  And he had that  Reductionism  He could do that  And I sort of like  Liked that  And I think I must have 
[01:47:00]  Picked some of that up  From him  He had a way of  Looking at something  And really presenting it  To you in bare bones  And of course  He went into  A different field  But I was able to  Use it in my field  You know  It's just a way of  Not BSing yourself  Looking at the thing  And saying  Hey  Wait a minute  What is this really  Oh yeah  Here's what they're doing  Why did stand-up  Become so likable  Oriented too  It's really  Annoying how they're  Focusing so much  On people being likable  And people being  Sweet and kind of 
[01:47:30]  Cuddly for an audience  In what respect  Where  Well just like  On television  It seems like  They just want to  Take the balls  Out of anything  Oh yeah  Especially stand-up  Performance wise  Well  I think  Everybody's running  Really scared  And I think  Any voice  That sounds  A little scary  To them  Is going to be  Neutralized  Or compromised  Or you know  Yeah  It's just  It's a  It's a  It's a stupid  If you're talking  About commercial 
[01:48:00]  Television  Forget it  Commercial anything  I mean  That's all  It's all it's about  Is selling goods  All that other stuff  Nothing  The stuff in between  Doesn't mean anything  It's just a delivery  System for  Sales  And  And you're not  Going to get  Anything worthwhile  In between the selling  You've been  Linked to the  FCC  Now  I mean  Forever  You will be  Forever  Linked with  These seven  Dirty words  Which is now  700  But it's gone  It's gone  So far  Beyond that now 
[01:48:30]  Because now  We don't only  Have to adhere  To FCC regulations  We have to adhere  To nice regulations  We have to  It's political  Correct  Little interest  Groups  That'll  Like Reverend Al  Sharp  And  And people  That will just  Fire off some  Letterhead  To your boss  And they will  Then give you  Another list  Of words  That you can  No longer  Use  On the air  This  Disgusts me  Sure  It  Completely  Takes 
[01:49:00]  The  Takes  Your  Balls away  You can't  Do the show  You want to do  No  Once advertising  Is involved  Once the cash  Register comes  Into play  Everything else  Is subordinated  To that  And has to be  Unfortunately  That's just  What they do  I just think  It doesn't  It would never  Pan out  To where  The advertiser  Really would  Have to worry  Like you say  Something on the air  A group comes up  And says  Alright we're  Going to boycott 
[01:49:30]  I would love  For someone  To go  Go ahead  Let me see  If this  Affects  Coca-Cola's  Bottom line  At the end  Of the year  Let's see  How far  This really  Would go  But they  Get so scared  We're talking  About the  Ima situation  Obviously  Like you know  When you do  A radio show  You follow  The FCC  Guidelines  You have to  Or you're  Going to get  Fired  And get  The company  Fine  But now  Like Ann  Said  It's not  About that  Anymore  You have  To now  Be nice  On the radio  You can't  Offend  You can't  Offend  Rutgers 
[01:50:00]  Basketball  Player  Woman's  Basketball  Player  People think  They have  A right  To not  Have their  Feelings  Hurt  I know  They actually  Think that's  A given  Right  That the  Forefathers  Wrote in  That said  Your feelings  They can't  Be hurt  And that is  You could say  Whatever you want  As far as  Hurting someone's  Feelings  They could come  Back at you  And say  Something else  But  That's that  Left wing  Paternalism  Big white  Oh yeah  Big white daddy  Knows best  Yep  That came 
[01:50:30]  You know  Everyone  We all got  To understand  That we could  Expect censorship  From the right  Wing  Over time  We know  That's where  It's going  To come  From  But to  Expect it  From the  Left wing  From the  Politically  Correct  People in  The campuses  Especially the  Eastern Ivy League  Campuses  That caught  Me by surprise  I mean  Isn't that  The guys  The people  You grew up  With  That were  Going to  You know  Really change  Things  And  You know  Had this  Freer thinking 
[01:51:00]  And then  It just  Turns out  To be  A bunch  Of  Phonies  Just like  You said  Paternalistic  The conservatives  Have always  Hid behind  Family values  And religion  And it seems  Like what the liberals  Hide behind  Is things like  Hate speech  Like that's how  They get you  To kind of  Not say  What kind of  Smashes their  Ideology  Yeah  It's  This country  Went off the cliff  And it's just  In free fall  Now  It's just  You know  We're waiting  For the  Big bang  To happen  And it's so  Wonderful  What nature 
[01:51:30]  Is doing  To smack  Us back  This  Arrogant  Species  Who overbuilds  Overreaches  Overuses  Wastes  Just completely  Lays  Waste  And despoils  Everything  It touches  Three wheel  Vehicles  All terrain  Vehicles  We're going  To go  Everywhere  There's  Some sand  We're going  To make  A mark  And we're  Going  To make  An ugly  Mark  And then  We're going  To not  Worry about  And we're  Going to  Come home  And we're  Going to  Barbecue  You know  It's just  A sick 
[01:52:00]  It's  Disgusting  My voice  You're hearing  You had a  Great take  On the  Beheadings  Everybody's  Like oh  How horrible  They are  And you said  The beheadings  When you  Said  F them  Stay out  Of another  Man's  Country  Jack  I'm like  God damn  It  That was a  Good point  Now you know  That  Put that  On your  List  Of stuff  Stuff not  To do  Yeah  What a  Great thing  To say  Though  Again  Boiling it  Right down  To the  Simplest  Of things  Simplifying 
[01:52:30]  That's why  When I hear  You say  Something like  The big  Invisible  Thing in  The sky  That people  Well we did  A whole bid  Yesterday  You know  The Harry  Potter books  Being banned  Because there's  Wizardry  And it's not  Good for the  Kids  And then  And then  Jimmy made  A brilliant  Observation  About you know  Our own  Jesus Christ  And the  Wizardry  That was involved  With that  Story  That was quite  Similar to some  Of the stuff  You're reading  In these  Harry Potter  Books  Yes  Like walking  On water  Changing water  To wine  Healing people  It's wizardry  Lazarus  Yeah  You know  You're not dead

[02:27:00]  Oh  It's  It's  Willie's  Willie's  Place  Yeah  I  Listened  To  That  One  I  Listened  To  The  Punk  One  What's  That  One  Called  Quite  Eclectic  There's  A bunch  Of  Yeah  And  I  Listened  To  Snoops  And  I  Listened  To  Rap  Punk  And  Vintage  Country  Vintage  Country  I'd  Like  To  Hear  Those  All  Thrust  Together  Into  One  Genre  Willie's  Place  Is  Fun  To  Listen  To  Yeah  Yeah  That  Old  Country  Shit  Is  Not  That  Bad  Great  Songs  Like  You've  Got  A  Drinking  Problem  And  That  Problem  Is  Me  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  That's a good one 
[02:27:30]  And my favorite  I'm trying to find the country western song  With the title is  Too Ugly For L.A.  Too Stupid For New York  Now that's a good one  Yeah  They sing about gravel roads  And red barns  And it's  Their dumb dog  It's  Very simple  Those  Those country folk  With their music  Well I don't like  I'm not so crazy  On middle of the road  Country now  But old country I like  I feel good  Right on  Everything you've done  Has been so  Eclectic 
[02:28:00]  And a little  Off kilter  Is there anything that  Like was poppy  Or popular  That you actually liked  And almost was embarrassed about  No  No  You're just  You're so  You're so all for that  No I'm either  Extremes I like  The middle  I'm scared  Like in a shopping mall  In suburbia  I feel like I'm gonna get beat up  Really  But anywhere else  I feel totally comfortable  In like a biker bar  Or you know  Anything like that  I'm fine  One end of the spectrum  Or the other  Yeah  Wow  That's really interesting  Actually 
[02:28:30]  Right  Yeah cause that's odd to me  Cause I'm kind of a  I'm kind of a middle of the road guy  Yeah  Like I'm comfortable  In suburbia  And places like that  That's where I ran from  Really  And I always feel that  Yeah I'm scared  Well you've done a good job  Embracing that side  Thank you  Because some of your work  Is just way out there  But oddly enough  The Hairspray  Is the most popular  Oh yeah  And they're sitting there  Watching two men  Sing a love song  To each other  And a play that encourages 
[02:29:00]  Your daughter to date  Black men when she's 15  So basically  I'm proud of that  They don't seem to notice  No  They sit there watching  Yeah they don't seem  To really grasp  What the story is about  That's going on  And how awful  They should feel about it  Well that's good  Maybe I tricked them into it  That's the way  You get people  To change their opinion  Is make them laugh  You tricked them  With pretty colors  And lights  And  And a fat girl  Fat girls  You know  That's the best  I get all fat work  Now I did a Discovery Channel  Show the other night  About a hippo  Because I was the voiceover 
[02:29:30]  And I think  Why did they offer me that job  And then I thought  Because it's about a fat animal  Fat animals  You've made a career  I'm Jack Spratt  You're like the Pied Piper  Of fat chicks  I am  How did you get Divine  To eat dog shit  At the end of  Oh  I wish I could  Show a new version  Yeah  It basically  It was  If it's anything scary  About that day  It was no big deal to us  Really  We were on pot  And basically  It was in the script  And Divine said  Sure  I'll do it  And I'm not a sadist  It was one take 
[02:30:00]  And you see  There's no cuts in it  And Johnny Knoxville  Would have done it today  Don't you think  It was just  A political action  At the time  I know that's hard to imagine  We had an intern  Brush his teeth  With dog shit  What's the difference  I mean you eat  You eat  But you know  It's funny  Some radio show  And it wasn't this one  But they offered  When Pink Something Girls  Came in again  On the air  Anybody that would come down  And eat dog shit  In front of the studio  They'd give $500  And no one came  I thought a junkie would  Wouldn't you  Yeah  For $500  It seemed to me  If you're really jones  And eat one dog turd  For you know 
[02:30:30]  For the whole day  Of a fix  I think if junkies  Had radios  They probably would have  Been lined up  Or some just publicity freak  People would do anything  To be famous  Well getting back to  We had Pat Duffy  Brush his teeth  With dog shit  And he got nothing for it  Well in the last  Recognition  We should have given him  $500  In the last Jackass movie  They drank horse semen  So it seems to me  That's worse to me  I mean if I had a choice  I don't know  That last Jackass movie  Had me laughing pretty good  Yeah he's great  Just the little hidden fist thing 
[02:31:00]  That popped out of the wall  And just punches  There's just something  About people getting hit  And falling down  That is hysterical  And I have no idea why  It's timeless  I was at the cellar  On Saturday  And they showed those  Old Charlie Chaplin movies  While you're eating lunch  And there was a table  A family  And there was a bunch of kids  And the kids were laughing  Their asses off  And I was thinking to myself  Wow that's Charlie Chaplin  They're laughing at  And then you realize  Because this physical  Like humor  Is timeless  Slapstick  Slapstick  More of the Three Stooges  I know 
[02:31:30]  Three Stooges will never go away  Yeah but girls don't like  The Three Stooges  No  Girls hate the Three Stooges  Hate the Three Stooges  And there's no explaining  That are pretty tough chicks  And they like them  The reason is  Because they know  That any one of them  Can be taking a wrench  Across the teeth  For one misstep  Around the house  I thought the shoe bomber  Looked exactly like Mo Howard  Mo Howard  When he sat down next to me  I thought this couldn't  Be a real terror  I mean look at him  He looks like the Three Stooges  Exactly I'd start laughing  With a shoe with wires  Hanging out of it 
[02:32:00]  But he was real  I was always amazed  That that was a real terrorist  I thought it had to be  Was his name something  It was Richard  Was Richard Reed  Or something Reed  Yeah  It was Mo Howard  Mo Howard  There you go  He had the hairdo  Why don't you think  Women like slapstick  No they like slapstick  They don't like  They like Charlie Chaplin  They don't like  The Three Stooges  Because the Three Stooges  Are violent  They're so violent about it  And they see the joy  It brings men  And I think that just  Kind of bothers them  And that scares them  I don't know  Who wants to get their eyes  Poked out too  For humor  Yeah  Or scissors put on your tongue 
[02:32:30]  Yeah yeah  Nose twisted with pliers  And I like their movies  When they made really bad movies  Like The Snow White  And The Three Stooges  Oh they were awful  Yeah they would do that  One of the great movies  Where she's skating  There's a skating star  In it with The Three Stooges  Yeah who is it  Sonia Henney  Or something  Yeah it was Sonia  I'm amazed you know that  Yeah  So don't you think  They should come back  And do The Three Stooges  They'll wreck The Three Stooges  If they remake it  Oh yeah  They wrecked The Honeymooners  They wrecked Caddyshack  There's a whole list  Of movies that are redoing that  Yeah  The in-laws 
[02:33:00]  They didn't wreck Hairspray  I don't think  No  They didn't  They didn't  They want to  I heard something  About The Three Stooges  But that would just  Be a disaster  They were going to remake it  With like George Clooney  Or something  I hate that  I like George Clooney  But come on  But who would we cast  If you were going to redo  The Three Stooges  And you can't do it  Who would be in it  It's kind of a time thing  It would be maybe unknowns  You don't have to get  Some of the Jackass crew probably  Yeah the Jackass  They are The Three Stooges  Or my pal Jim Norton  Only nude  Jim Norton's a terrific actor  You should do some with 
[02:33:30]  Oh yeah  I didn't want to  Whore myself  He's a terrific actor  Yeah  I always look directly  Into the eyes of the other actor  And I point for emphasis  Really  I think the best way  To ever have an audition  Is to be able to pass  A lie detector test  Which Divine did  For shoplifting once  And I thought  Wow that's really  And he did do it  No kidding  And so if you're guilty  And see if you can pass  A lie detector test  Isn't that the best  Acting audition  Yeah  That is really good  My brother  Passed one once 
[02:34:00]  And he did it  Yep  Yeah  You just have to be confident  Yeah  And that's what it is  I make fun of the  Policeman's clothes  I guess  I don't think I'd pass  A lie detector  I never had one  There's this weird guilt  In me  I'm like I know  I didn't do anything wrong  But I just like  Even if I'm innocent  I would fail it  I'm one of those  I'm so guilt ridden  That when I go into a store  And don't buy something  When I'm leaving  I linger around the door  So because I imagine  People will go  If he stole something  He wouldn't be hanging out  Well then you know  What's going to happen  To you  Spontaneous combustor  That's when you're so guilty 
[02:34:30]  That you just burst into flames  I want to die that way  So Catholic  So guilty  That I just burst into flames  So you leave good shoes  Because that's always  The crime scene  Yeah  The shoes  With that  And then  Just some rendered  Fat blame  It is  I feel like guilty  Whenever I walk into a store  And don't buy anything  Or if I have a bag  And I want to look at something else  In the store  But I've already bought stuff  I make sure I hold the bag way away  So no one thinks I'm shoving stuff in there 
[02:35:00]  Why the fuck  Well I used to be a really good shoplifter  So my karma's bad  Oh really  So I always think  Someone's going to steal my bag in a store  I sucked at shoplifters  As a kid I would do it  But were you good  Yeah  I even once was shoplifting  And I saw the store detective see me  And I put it back  And they didn't see me  And she arrested me outside  And I sued and got $4,000  Well that's a good scam though  You steal something  And then you put it back  You need money today  Go into a department store  With a pair of ripped tennis shoes  Go up to the complaint  And say  I just ripped my shoes on the escalator 
[02:35:30]  And they'll give you $20  That's awesome  Better than eating a dog turd  For $500  Yeah exactly  My friend Marvin and I  Were stealing when we were kids  When I was never good thieves  Like oh but  We stole Star Wars figures  And we got caught  But Marvin had a really big penis  So I'll never forget  Like we  The guy was looking at the bulge  In Marvin's fucking shorts  And he made me leave the room  And he made Marvin pull aside  His thing to show  That he didn't have a Star Wars figure  Could be arrested  But was he after him 
[02:36:00]  I mean  He must have been  Because I'll never forget the guy  Going what do you got there  And I  My dick  We were like 12  And Marvin  How did you know he had a big dick  Because I knew Marvin  He was one of my best  I mean  I have best friends  I'm not really aware of  They're  Peter meter  I think it's an interesting question  But Marvin was just known  For his large penis  It was a legend  Oh he was known  So yeah Marvin  Like Uncle Miltie  Kind of a thing  I've never seen it  But apparently  Everyone knows it 
[02:36:30]  Right  You can tie it in a knife  Forrest Tucker  Another one  We were facing four  And Marvin pulled his thing aside  And then I'll never forget  And the guy asked me  To wait outside  After that  So I imagine  He might have fumbled  With Marvin's  Fucking  Right  Yeah big delicious  Vader-ish cock  Another thing is  In the summer  You can do this  Go in a store  And put on the clothes  If you have on just shorts  And then say  Is the boss here  I'd like to apply for a job  And then fill out a job  Because you really don't think  You're stealing  If you're dressed in the clothes  And give me all your personal info  Yeah  While you're  While you have the skull  Well you feel fake stuff 
[02:37:00]  I almost got the job  When I did it  I was in Provincetown though  You're brilliant man  Hello  I don't do that stuff anymore  John I was reading up on you  Before you came in here  And you were a fan  Of Mondo Topless  Russ Myers  Well Russ Myers  Certainly yeah  I interviewed him  In my book shock value  A long time ago  Is he still alive?  No he died  The art of the topless  I can't get enough  Of Russ Myers  Well his girls look great  If you like big breasts  Hey he is Citizen Kane  Yeah  Absolutely  Super Vixens  The best one I think  Were the early ones  Like certainly Lorna 
[02:37:30]  Where the ad was longing  Love  Lust  Life  Lorna  And she just swims  With her head  And her breasts  Out of the water  Which is hard to do  To swim  It's the breaststroke  Like you've never seen it  Up  Yeah  The breaststroke  Is usually forward  She swam up  Yeah  Mondo Topless  I brought that one  To our show  It is just a waste  Of film  The narration is  Fantastic  But the narration  Is just amazing  He continued with that  These bodacious beauties  We got a little 
[02:38:00]  Taste of money  Oh boy  Wrong guy in there  I just love it  The beginning of  Faster Pussycat  Is really good too  When he says  If you meet these women  Then it opens up  To this guy  Going go baby  Go go  And I just was with  Tora Satana  The star of that  She's great  She's still great  She's like  Probably near 70 years old  And looks great  And fun  And still looks good  I guess that was  The start of porn  Or is that  No  Is that bad to say  To someone like Russ  Well Russ never did hardcore  He never would  It was very titillating though  Mondo Topless 
[02:38:30]  Is a bunch of like girls  Talking about their breasts  For two hours  All natural  Big hairy muffs  It was sexploitation  Sexploitation  Yeah  It was before porn  It's an insult to say  It's in the porn genre  Yes  Because it isn't  It was before porn  It was sexploitation  And porn ended sexploitation  Really  Once it came out  Then there was nobody  Those directors  Were out of business  Once it became readily available  Radley Metzger  He became Henry Paris  That was his porn name  Because they didn't want  To confuse their careers  There was something  About sexploitation  I would love to see that  Come back in some way 
[02:39:00]  Yeah well it won't  Because  I mean  Hollywood does now  I mean Hollywood  Almost does porn  It's just too easy  To get right to the fucking  Yeah  And tub girl  Or porn  These brutal  Tom Carl movies now  You know  Gag factor part six  Or like  See girls gums bleed  That's ironic  And you know  You take EpiCac now  Instead of Poppers  When you're watching  Yeah  Let's all puke  And watch  You know  Gee it's a long way  From ecstasy 
[02:39:30]  With Hedy Lamarr  Yeah  That's so true  Yeah  You can't really  Put out a movie  That's going to shock anybody  Because of what's available  On the internet  You know  You've seen shit  You want to see  A chick blowing a horse  There it is  Well did you see  The movie Zoo  It's really a good art movie  About the guy  That got  In Seattle  It's really a good movie  I want to see that  It's really great  It makes you almost say  Oh well there is an underground  Which there is  I didn't know  It's a whole documentary  Are you zoo  I'm not 
[02:40:00]  Is it more than one  Or just the guy  That had sex  All of them  And they talk about it too  And the guy  The worst thing  About the guy with the horses  He was sloppy seconds  The one that died  The first guy survived  And took him to the hospital  And just dumped him  And ran  Because what are you going to say  What happened to the horse  Nothing  Well they pretty much  Know what happened  His asshole's open  He's got hay in his hair  Another big mystery  You know but the movie's good  The movie isn't a cheap shot  In a way  Not that that was a cheap shot  But basically  It is  Presents it in a way  That's kind of amazing 
[02:40:30]  So I think it'll be out  On DVD soon  It's really good  Is the movie about  The sex farm  Because supposedly  There's farms around America  Where these people  Could go and have sex  Well this is one of them  Yes  And they go there  And join up  And then the worst thing  About it is  When the animal workers  Come in  They see another horse  Giving another one  A blowjob  And that horse  Don't do that  So basically  Well they learned  What's going on there  They learned  That was the most shocking  Thing of the movie  There was some learning  Going on  But do you really want  A blowjob from a horse  With those big choppers 
[02:41:00]  I hope he has  Good technique  Getting blown by Hillary Clinton  Is it  Is it  You know  Is it  Can an animal participate  I don't know  It's a question  I never hope  I have to decide  Ethically  Is it exploiting the animal  Or is the animal  Just having a great time  I haven't had that bad  A night yet  But you know what  We save things  For the autumn of our years  Yes  The dogs always seem  To have fun though  Yeah  With the little  Oven mitts  Taped on there  Oh I'm sorry 
[02:41:30]  Yeah that's a bit much  I'm scared of all animals  Trying to bite me anyway  One of our favorite clips  We play  The chicken clip  The chicken clip  Oh that's horrible  What chicken clip  Is a German guy  Fucking a chicken  Oh I thought you meant  From my movie  Pink Flamingos  We have a chicken  You do have a chicken  But we ate the chicken  Yeah  Well I didn't  One of the actors did  I have a question for you  About that documentary  Before we get off that  Of the zoo  In the movie  There's a guy being  Fucked by a horse  In the original  And there's a guy  Whose job is  To hold the horse's penis  And not allow  Too much to go in 
[02:42:00]  Right  And he didn't do  Did he ever explain  Why he moved his hands  In the movie  They don't show the footage  Which I think they shouldn't  Which you can see online  I don't want to see  I'm sorry  I like fake hideousness  Real hideousness  I don't want to see  A snuff movie  I don't want to see  So to me  I didn't look it up  So I'm not really aware  Of the details  Of every bit of the  Foreplay  The guy dropping the cock  As it were  Yeah  Well  Horse gives him  A solid deep dicking  It's not a long one  But it's effective  Because the guy moves 
[02:42:30]  His hands out of the way  And then the horse  You've seen it  Oh many times  Yeah I made my friend  Watch it  He goes  Dude it pops  You can hear it pop  When the horse  Pulls out  Oh my god  I don't know  I think  You know  There's some minorities  Like adult babies  I take a separate  I'm not joining their march  We had one of those  Adult babies on our show  Our last show  Yeah  Call the police  Yeah with like  A dominatrix  Who plays the mommy  I know  And he's the  You know  Goo goo ga ga  With the bottle  I don't get it  Thank god 
[02:43:00]  I don't get it  And I remember she said  I'm going to bring  An adult baby  But you guys can't make fun  Yeah don't make fun of him  It's like  Well there's a 300 pound man  In a bouncy chair  With a heart on  We won't make fun of him  Right  Thank you John  Thank you  Thank you John Waters  I'm liberal but  So ahead of time  We talked it out  Where they were like  Alright we'll be respectful  And all that  As soon as he walked in  All those conversations  We had went out the window  Howling  Dying  Dying  Well I'm just glad  I don't think people  Choose to be an adult baby 
[02:43:30]  Something happened bad  And I'm just glad  I'm not one  Yeah  There's a lot of things  You think  Well thank god  I'm not that  It's hard enough  The one I'm really glad  I don't have  Is where you get off  By paying people  To have sex  That you have to do  Thank god  I don't have that one  Oh boy  That's fine  John look to your left  I've done that  He's talking  But it turns you on  The paying up  I'm not saying  The people you get  From paying  But there is  Certain people  That if they don't pay  They don't get it up  Thank god  I don't have that  I think it has  Something  The paying 
[02:44:00]  Is something about  It's a complete  Losing responsibility  It's almost like  It frees you up  From any responsibility  To the other person  That was the attractiveness  In paying for it  It wasn't even  The sexual act  It was the idea  That if you pay somebody  It's like they're  Then an employee  And you're completely  Free to do what you want  Without worrying about that  Well I know you're not  Completely free to do  What you want in my office  When I'm the boss  I mean I don't feel like  You know  I don't think that works  Because you still have to  Treat your employees well  Oh yeah  But I'm just saying  Like the turn on 
[02:44:30]  I'm not saying  I'm not saying  Like you can do  You know  Then like say  Like lick the floor  Yeah yeah  No no  But that's  That's what the turn on  Is like you don't  Have to worry about  Am I good in bed  We all have our insecurities  And that insecurity  Goes away almost like  When you've paid for it  Because you're like  It doesn't matter  If I'm good  So then that fear  Isn't there  Because the money  Unless they're keeping  A little diary  God damn  He sucks  What a piece of shit  Exactly  Why earn that hundred  I said  This is kind of odd  An influence  Walt Disney 
[02:45:00]  Well he had  The great villains  You know  Certainly  I always rooted  For the stepmother  Cinderella should be  Home cleaning  And the wicked witch  She had a heart  And little box  And those dreary  Ingenues  That just wear  Bad outfits  And walked around  And cruised the prince  Who I never liked anyway  So to me  I always liked the villains  And wanted to be  A Disney villain  And I try still  To look like one  Yeah  I was looking at that look  He got like  The Waltz mustache too  Thank you  Well he had a thicker one  I had more  Little Richard  Little Richard  Well  What do you think 
[02:45:30]  About the Hitler mustache  Is that ever  Going to make a comeback  Yeah no  On women  On maybe  On some transsexuals  That might have an edge  That would be amazing  He ruined that look  It would have just  I think that would have  Come back  Because everything  Comes back over time  Except that  Except that Hitler mustache  It's definitely  A retro look  That hasn't caught on  Yeah  Well give it a few  More hundred years  No a woman  Has to wear it  You think a woman  Comes out with the  Hitler mustache  It might  It might be confusing 
[02:46:00]  Enough to reinvent it  They have down  Between the legs  They've done the  Shaving where  They call it a Hitler mustache  Oh god  Which looks ridiculous  We've noticed  The Hitler mustache  Looks okay  If the woman's  Standing up with  Her legs together  The second she lays down  And spreads her legs  It's out of place  It just looks like  This tuft of hair  Was thrown  Somewhere between  Her belly button  And the taint  It's a little too high  Yeah it's too high up  I don't like all that  Creative shaving  I'm not a big fan  Of that 
[02:46:30]  Thank you  On anybody  Thank you  You know what I like  And I always get  The shit for it  From these guys  I like a natural  Shaped triangle  But kept  Trimmed  Trimmed  Trimmed  I'm not talking  A big 70's  Earth mama  Angela Davis  Afro  But Angela Davis  Still has always  Great hair  She has blonde  Dreadlocks now  She's always  Had great hair  I like her  I like Angela  But you don't want  That between the legs  I want to  I want to play  I don't want to play  You like hair  I don't care

[02:49:30]  Well you don't want to tell John this  One of our guys peed on some artwork  That's a no no right  No it wasn't artwork  Warhol had oxidation paintings  Where celebrities peed on canvases  And they go for millions of dollars  And they're beautiful  Wow see  This didn't help the value of the art  Oh no  It did sometimes  It's been done  That's why it's already been done  This was to show  What hasn't  That this artist and his work was shit  That's not good right John  Well no because Manzoni is an artist  That sold shit in a can  For twice the way  In the 30s 
[02:50:00]  For twice the price of gold  And now it's worth way more than that  At auction  What did he do with the shit  He put it in cans  And then he sold it  For twice the price of gold at the time  And now an auction of Sotheby's and Crispy  Goes for way way more than that  Wait how can you see the logs  If it's in a can  You can't  They've never been open  Manzoni  They're sealed in a can  It's been done  Shit's been done in art  That's amazing  That's what art's about  Thinking up something that hasn't been done  Wait are they still in the can  The logs  Yes  You can shake them around and hear it  No there I think  Who knows  Because there's only open one of them  As soon as you open it 
[02:50:30]  The value's over  And you just lost like $100,000  What if it's just putty in there  Well there isn't  Because  Who knows what it is  But it's art  It doesn't matter  It's magic  Alright but here's what I got  Art is magic  But this is my question for John Waters  I've never heard of that  If one of us  Starts shitting in a can  It gets nothing  It's over it's been done  It gets nothing  It's been done  You didn't think of it first  But why does this guy  Get to be famous for  He thought of it first  Period  That's what it comes down to  Yes  So all we have to do  Is come up with something  That's never been done  And I can be a great artist  Good luck  Yes  Good luck though 
[02:51:00]  Good luck  It's not so easy  You're trying to tell me  There's got to be guys out there  That thought of something first  And they're not  They're not making money off it  Never hear of Piss Christ  Yeah  Of course  Yeah see  That was something  That hadn't been done  That's the only reason  I have beautiful paintings  By a woman  Jess Vonder  Who paints with her menstrual blood  And she said  That basically  She had her period  Twice a month  So why not use it  You know  Really  Wow  I started a thing  Where I stomp  Homeless guys  Cakes  Why am I not famous  In making multi-millions 
[02:51:30]  Of dollars  You do what  I stomp on  Homeless people's cakes  Because that's mean  But it's so hard  I'll give you that  It was really mean  Here's my favorite  Homeless person I saw  He had a sign  Two days in a row  And it wasn't a joke  It was the best one  I ever saw  The only one I gave money to  He was sitting on the street  And his little sign  Said  I used to be quite attractive  I thought it was really  A good one  I do give those guys money  If they have a creative sign  I'm with you buddy  That's a great one  You worked it  That's a great one  A little creativity there  But what if I told everyone 
[02:52:00]  That's my art  I'm stomping on cakes  It's a visual  And then I can display  The stomped cake  Well you didn't yet  So I don't know  Have a show  And see if it works  I don't get how this art thing works  I really don't  It's magic  Why did that guy  Get famous for shitting in cans  Because it was a brilliant idea  And he did it first  Yes  And it made you think  About the price of art  And about money  You can be very intellectual about it  Or you can do it  Because he was funny  And the fact that  You weren't seeing it  Was kind of  Yes  It was kind of ironic  What really is in there 
[02:52:30]  What's your definition of art  Art is something  That first makes me  Contemporary art  That first makes me angry  And then it appeals  To my sense of humor  And then I love to live with it  Because it makes me see  That thing differently  For the rest of my life  How will it make you angry though  Like a piece of art  Make you angry  God well certainly  Don't you think  The first painting  Of the soup can  By Warhol  Or the dribbling of paints  By Jackson Pollock  It made everybody angry  And it changed art  Overnight when Andy  Did that soup can  All the people  That did abstract paintings 
[02:53:00]  Were out of business  The same way when the Beatles  Put Motown out of business  In one night  I happen to see  The soup can  In Soho  Over the weekend  Not the  The painting  But a replica  And it made me angry  I'm like  What the fuck is it  What is this shit  Oh that's great  It was a brilliant idea  The hand painted  Beautiful first soup cans  Are beautiful paintings  How much are they worth  Oh probably a million  Or something  And Dennis Hopper  Was the only  The first show they had  And there was  I think  I forget I'm wrong here  But maybe 20 of them  And they were 100 bucks each 
[02:53:30]  And nobody bought one  Except Dennis Hopper  Bought one for 100  And he still has it  You think  No he sold it  For a million  I don't know  I think no  I think it was been sold  That's really interesting  His definition of art  That it makes you angry  That's very interesting  Yeah  At first it makes you angry  Then you're in on it  Then you can see something  In a new way  It's a magic trick  Why does it make you angry though  Because you felt like  You weren't in on it  Or  You didn't  You thought  Wait a minute  This is too much  Come on  It makes you angry  Like I could do this  No you couldn't  And you didn't stupid  And then you get it 
[02:54:00]  And then you get it  And then every time  You're in the supermarket  And you see a can  You think of art  You don't think of commerce anymore  I think you might have  Described our show  That's true  I'm serious  In a can  Yes  Right  Right  The can thing  No there's a lot of people  That listen to us  The first listen  They hate our fucking guts  And then you  Then you hear from them  A couple months later  And they feel like  They're in on it  They're hooked  That's right  I like that definition of art  Because every once in a while  People ask us to define art  I'm like  I know it when I see it  Like they used to say  About porn  Yeah porno 
[02:54:30]  I can't define it  But I know it when I see it  Don't you all have to go to the bathroom  Yes  These guys are going to  John you're an interesting guy  Each other's dicks  Hold on  Yeah we're going to take a  We're going to take a leak  And we'll be back  Hold each other's cocks  John Waters  He's doing a one man show  Called The Filthy  This Filthy World  It just comes out on DVD  This next week  October 30th  Oh you already did the one man show  Oh yeah  It's a DVD of it  Why weren't we invited  Because it was  I don't know  It was a  You know  We shot it with a  Recruited audience  Through Netflix  For all the people  That bought my films  Jeff Garland 
[02:55:00]  From Curb  Yeah we'll talk about  This Filthy World  Excuse me  With John Waters  We'll talk more in a bit  It's Opie and Anthony  Welcome to The Opie and Anthony Show  The venomous voices  Of the vastly vulgar airwaves  Introducing  The Destroyer  Operator of the OCD  Organization Opie  The Professor  The know-it-all  Neurotic Nancy Anthony  Swing over to  Little Jimmy Dorn  The worthless  Chinless  Box a master of laugh  Meet the irritating 
[02:55:30]  Extra of excrement  E-Rock  Or the swishy  Audio shim  Steve C  And don't forget  Sam  Black and white  50-50  Where it counts  Corrupting the cavities  Of ear holes everywhere  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  Opie and Anthony  Oh I'm in the middle  Chewing  We're back 
[02:56:00]  Gino from Philly  Must talk about this  Check this article out  This artist  Let a dog starve  And die in front of people  And it's considered art  Well it wouldn't be to me  You know  I said I don't like  Snuff movies  I don't like real violence  I don't like real cruelty  So it wouldn't be to me  But I think it was probably  A misguided  Try it art  What was that?  Huh?  What was that?  A bell of some sort 
[02:56:30]  Yeah a bell  I think my battery  Needs to be recharged  See I'm weird with art  It's like  I know you're supposed to  Well you can't define  What's another person's art  But I look at certain people  That do things  Just to be  To me  Mock outrageous  And I find it to be  Kind of corny  Or you can try too hard  Definitely  Yeah  Definitely try too hard  Like piss Christ  It's like we get it  You're shocking  What I like is impenetrable  Is what works for me in art  It's impossible to understand  And regular people  Can't understand it  And don't get it  And it makes them mad  That helps  What's an example of that?  Well minimalism certainly 
[02:57:00]  Where there's almost nothing there  Which I think is great  I'm a fan of that  Wait what is it?  Well you know  A white painting  Oh god yeah  I'm out  I see that stuff  That's my favorite  You like that stuff?  It's a white painting  And there's a red dot  And it's not even in the center  I will say though  I've seen stuff like that before  Where I don't know  How it made me feel  But I couldn't stop looking at it  Like there have been those  That they give you  Like a really weird feeling  And you're like  I just gotta look at this  For a few minutes  I don't know why  I have an artist  Like Clay Ketter  And basically  It's just do drywall paintings 
[02:57:30]  You know what that looks like  When they do in your garage?  But he used to do it for real  And make $10 an hour  And now they're $20,000  It's a good career move to me  And what is it?  Just one color?  It looks like a drywall painting  You know how the white  Goes on cardboard  It looks like that  I mean you put it in a gallery  It's kind of great  Now you never look at drywall the same  That's what I'm saying  Magic  Art is magic  It is magic  It certainly is  In one thing I asked John about  Do you want to  Go, go  No I had a question about  Because David Lynch to me  Is a very  Is a brilliant director  But he's hard to follow 
[02:58:00]  And it's like  I want to understand  What he's saying  Because I watch it  And I like  In Lost Highway  Yeah yeah  What the fuck was going on?  Maybe David doesn't understand it himself  So even that's better  You're all trying to figure it out  So you don't always have to understand things  Again  You get angry  At some of these movies  That you watch  I get angry at ones  That have been  Test marketed so much  To make everyone like it  That everyone hates them  That they  You know  That they're written by 30 people  So every person in America 
[02:58:30]  It hits every beat of a happy ending  They learn something  That's what makes me angry  Well it's like my favorite movie  Cheaper by the Dozen  Steve Martin just has this knack  Of remaining funny  And yet he brings it home  Shut up  You know I just  You know I'm the opposite  Like when Forrest Gump started running  I wanted a censor to call  I want to know  Who do I call in my community  When I feel violated  Yeah  I liked that movie more  Five years after it came out  I didn't like Gump when I first saw it  And then in hindsight  I was like 
[02:59:00]  Yeah that kind of was  Like a nice movie  And entertaining  It was kind of a zealot rip off  But I mean it was still  Interesting  I just made John Waters  Want to spit in my face  No no I didn't  No I didn't  And I'm a fan of Tom Hanks  You know it's just to me  The test marketing thing  Is really interesting  That he brought up  Is there any commercial movie  That you did like  Sure  And it goes against  Everything you believe in  Like oh my god  They're politically correct  The humor is just right  And there's a message  At the end  No not that type of  I was a big fan of  Grindhouse  A movie that  Well that's not  No but it was 
[02:59:30]  A big budget movie  I loved Grindhouse by the way  Me too  And I'm so sad  Are you surprised  That it didn't do well  And that they changed it now  And you know  Separated the Siamese twins  And there was no trailer  To me  I think it was a great art movie  You know it was  It really  Because I went to  Grindhouses growing up  I used to sit in Baltimore  I'd be the only white person  In mostly blaxploitation theaters  And they'd be like  Give me some green  That means gore  And then rats would really  People would put their foot up  Rats would run around the theater  It added to it  It added to it  And I remember I was the only  White person watching  Mandingo  I don't know if you remember 
[03:00:00]  That movie at the end  They'd boil a white person  In a pot  The slave owner  And I thought  Wow  This is really interesting here  And when the lights come on  You're just kind of  It was refreshing to see  I'm the guy  It was refreshing to see  A movie like Grindhouse though  Yeah  Me too  I thought it was really  We had all those guys  Come through  And we really enjoyed the movie  And I think a big majority  Of our listeners  Didn't like it  And they're like  Why are you guys  Chilling for this movie  And blah blah blah  I'm like  No we really do enjoy 
[03:00:30]  It was the best movie of the year  We really enjoyed it  I liked it  I didn't love it  Like much  Some of his other stuff  Like Reservoir Dogs  But I still did enjoy it  Quentin's great  I mean he's a real thematic  I liked Rodriguez  He's the real thing  Robert Rodriguez  His film was better  Than Quentin's probably  I liked them both  That car chase  Come on  That was pretty cool  The car chase  Yeah  It was amazing  And that wasn't done  With tricks  That was  I mean you know  Imagine the continuity problems  Of how many cars 
[03:01:00]  They had to have  They had to shoot it  Because every time  You got one dent  In the wrong place  It doesn't match  The next shot  We asked them  About that scene  And Quentin  And he explained  That Zoe  The stunt woman  Zoe right  That she's on the hood  For the whole  You know the car chase  And they explained  How they did that  With she was on a wire  But the guy was  In the back seat  You know  Hiding from the camera  Letting out some slack  Every so often  Pulling it back  Like oh wow  She was really on the front of that  You gotta be very trusting  As far as the people  That are hiding in the car  No green screen there 
[03:01:30]  Some people have to be  Yeah  That's why it works  To me all those  Really expensive special effects  Make  I think bad special effects  Are more involving to me  When it's just a science project  Not a movie  Yeah  Like in  What was the movie  Where the black hole  Where they're like  Just hovering outside the hole  Still talking  And it was like  This was really awful  It did not look realistic  At all  I thought that was a porn movie  You'd pick a great movie  Jim  What were we talking about  During the break  There was a couple things  John brought up  And  We talked about 
[03:02:00]  David Lynch  Political correctness  David Lynch  I am politically correct  I think  Yeah  Yeah  No  Sure I am  Political correctness  Doesn't make fun of anything  Or offend anybody  Sure it does  Political correctness means  I mean if you're gonna make  A Jewish joke  It helps to be Jewish  And I agree  You can get away  With a lot more humor  If you're making fun  Of yourself first  Then you have freedom  To make fun of others  I think  Like you  I think  That kind of narrows down  The spectrum though  Because like  What if a black guy 
[03:02:30]  Has great observations  On white people  He should be able to make them  And he can  Yeah  It just depends  I'm not saying  There's rules  But  But I'm saying  I think even though  My films piss off  Some amount of people  And everything  They are politically correct  Because the people that win  Mind their own business  And don't judge other people  Which is political  Correctness to me  Is I'll understand anything  I'll be sitting  People tell me anything  I'm sitting on an airplane  And the straightest looking woman  I don't know next to me  Will turn to me and say  My whole family  Fucked me under the Christmas tree  You know  Why did she tell me that 
[03:03:00]  But I do understand  And try to counsel her  Basically  See our definition  Of political correctness  Is what's different here  Because I think  That that's not being  Politically correct  I just think  That's being decent  Like political correctness  To me is an arrogance  It's a  Let me dictate  What you should say  Well it is an arrogance  In a certain way  A liberal arrogance  When people say  I had it from  In the serial mama movie  I made Kathleen Turner  Call everyone a cocksucker  And this gay militant  Said to me  What's the matter  With that John  I thought  Oh come on 
[03:03:30]  You know  What  You have a sense  It's a humor first  You know  Hell  So I'm not that  What you're talking about  Is that like the police  Out there  But  And I've always  Made fun of liberals  Because I am one  I make fun of gaily incorrect  Because I am gay  So basically  You can do that  And I do bait people like that  But that's to make them laugh  So they change their mind  But it's good to violate  Like with someone eating dog shit  That's like violating  And I'm saying that  In a great way  Real conventions of society  Or real like 
[03:04:00]  Views of society  So like  It's so PC now  And everybody is so soft  And so afraid  Of saying the wrong thing  It's just disingenuous  To me  To have a moment like that  Would be to violate  That PC mentality  When we made that movie  The real reason  I did that scene  And it's sort of lost  In history  Was it was the year  Deep Throat came out  It was the year  Pornography sort of  Became legal  So we try to think  Well what isn't illegal  That they don't  Have a law against  Yet  And they do now  It's the one thing  You can't do in porn  But we did not do this  For sexual reasons 
[03:04:30]  It was not coprophagia  It was a political action  Against taste  Where it was a comedy routine  Where  But that today  Is something you can't  Even do in porno  So now there are  Laws against it  They couldn't censor it  At the time  Because they didn't  Who would do this  Why would there be a law  Because why would someone  Eat dog shit  For entertainment  So it was also  Like the Mondo movies  If you remember all them  They would show  See natives in other countries  Eating raw monkey balls  That kind of thing  And so it was 
[03:05:00]  Kind of  A joke on that too  Now filthy  And reality television  Before  I mean Divine  Really did  There was no cut  She could see  Reality TV  Is not  Based on reality though  No  I mean  And you know  I don't  I never watch reality TV  Because I live in Baltimore  I just step outside  Why would I possibly  Need it  Take a look  Look around  We have to take a train  Every once in a while  To the Washington  You know  The XM compound  And we drive through  This part of Baltimore  We just pray  The train doesn't break down 
[03:05:30]  Or pray  The first time we went through  We're like  Please tell me  They're not stopping here  Well it's great view  And it's the part  Where I make movies  About those kind of neighborhoods  It is horrifying  It looks beautiful  Do you like the wire?  It is cool  It looks like a post-apocalyptic set  I think the wire  Is the best show on television  I agree  It's Baltimore  And it's the final season  They just did  And it's this year  About the press  And it's like reading a novel  It's the only television  You really have to pay attention  And there's a lot of characters  And it's really brilliant  I think  Yeah I agree  I never saw the wire  It's all the  Baltimore  And they were supposed to do 
[03:06:00]  Five sections  Of like  I want to say drugs  Or life in the streets  Where they deal with politics  They deal with the kids  They deal with the drug dealers  That was a great season  Season two  Yeah  Yeah  So there's all  Kind of neighborhoods in Baltimore  You can be in great ones  And terrible ones  But I like all of them  And it's an extreme city  Because people think  Why would you leave  Your own neighborhood  They really don't  And it's  You know  My favorite story there  And this is in this filthy world  My thing is  I saw a family  It's my favorite  It gets the biggest laugh  So the family walking up the street 
[03:06:30]  In Baltimore  And one's  Dad  Why is mommy crying?  He said  Because you're an asshole  And that kind of sums up  The humor of the city  So this filthy world  Let's dig into that  Obviously you take on  Some taboo topics  Well I hope so  I mean if it's called  You know  This filthy world  What am I going to talk about?  You know  Pedophilia  Gay marriage  Yeah  Drug use  Right  All the obvious things  For humor 
[03:07:00]  Probably the stuff  You talk about too  We make fun of  Horrific things on this show  Yeah  But humor is the best way  To win  It's how I didn't get beat up  In high school  Because the people  That would have beat me up  And there were plenty of them  Thought that I hated authority  Even more than they did  Which kept me safe  And they knew  That I could make them laugh  And if you can make somebody laugh  They won't hit you  They might sleep with you  And they also  You can get them  To change their mind  About politics  If you can make them laugh  It's protection 
[03:07:30]  And it's a shield  You can wear  To get through life  Yeah being funny  In school  Was really helpful  It was really helpful  You could  Because  Yeah  Because you know  If you didn't have the body  To be a jock  Or you know  You weren't a brain  And the brains  Always got beat up anyway  Because they weren't funny  But you could just be  A funny guy  You could really get yourself  Out of some sticky situations  Just by making people laugh  It was kind of immunity  From hassle  If you were funny  Yeah 
[03:08:00]  But you had to make  The guys that would beat you up  Be funny  Who cares  If the brains laugh  Well yeah  I care  Because they wouldn't  Let you copy their homework  But the big dumb jocks  That would have hit you  They were the ones  Their fear is that  You were going to embarrass them  So a lot of times  You're right  They wouldn't fuck with you  Because they knew  You could make fun of them  And they're just  Just dummies  And all you had to do  Was duty jokes  You know  Oh yeah  Because they weren't smart enough  To understand cleverness  Like a fart sound  They thought you were  A prior in 76  Right  Here's a fart joke 
[03:08:30]  Don't beat me  How do you deal  With some of these  Things I was saying  What  Rich subject  Yeah  There was  Pedophilia  I look like a child molester  I know that  But I'm not  Sorry  We didn't mean to laugh  Extra hard there  Thank God  You know  I'm not  But I go to  Children's movies alone  And I walk in  And I say to the woman  Yeah one please  And she'll say  This is a children's movie  You know  And then I sit by myself  And I see parents say  Sit over here  Move over here  Away from me 
[03:09:00]  So it'll be a crowded movie theater  With empty seats around me  And I like kids  You know  I'm a  I would be a terrible father  Because I'm too self involved  But I'm a good uncle  Get you an abortion  Get you out of jail  Help you cop drugs  Whatever you need  I'm the cool uncle  You like children's movies  And animation stuff  No not animation so much  I like  I like just  Benji  I like  Benji  I'll go see  You know  The worst children's movie 
[03:09:30]  Because I kind of like them  And I'm making a children's movie now  Next year  A terribly wonderful  Children's Christmas adventure  Called Fruitcake  Oh no way  Yeah and all the kids  Are like John Waters characters  Is it going to be something like  The Cranks movie  Because that got me to laugh  I didn't see that  But I hope  It got you to laugh  I hope it is like it  Oh when everything goes wrong  At Christmas  Yeah well this is  I'm not going to talk about it  Because I haven't done it  It's bad luck  Jimmy  Jimmy I don't know how you sit there  With an actual straight face  And blurt out horrid movies  I love it 
[03:10:00]  There's nothing that makes me happier  Than when I see a fucking  I mean I like Tim Allen more  Steve Martin I used to love  But every time I see that smug face  I just want to fucking vomit  Oh I think he was the best Oscar host  He was really funny  I completely agree  Yeah  We were just talking about that  Yeah  To me the fucking best line in the Oscars  Was when  After they show the montage of dead people  He said  Coming up next  We're going to show you  People who you thought were dead  But aren't  Yeah  That's the Gene Herschel award  Isn't it  You know what  Just an observation  When they do the death montage  Every year at the Oscars 
[03:10:30]  It amazes me  That some dead people  Get more applause than others  Yeah  More popular dead people  This guy's more popular dead  Than the one prior to him  Well you know what they say  Death  Sometimes a great career move  You get more famous  When you got  You know  Which is a sad thing  But it's true  Like Art Carney got a  Huge  Huge applause  They've had Divine on the  Every year he died on the Oscars  Which I was really proud  They put him right in  Yeah  Right as he started  To eat the dog shit  Oh wow  They did  And it was so fast  That I think  You know  Some of the older  Academy members  May have missed it 
[03:11:00]  When they were looking  At Greer Garson  Wow  Right  So do you like  His new movies  Or no  Because my best gal  And I were watching  I was trying to show  The original Pink Panther  Yeah  Because the fact  That he's redoing that  I haven't seen it  I haven't seen it  It's sinful  For him to redo that  They should remake  The bad ones  Like Ice Castles  Thank you  And things like that  Ice Castles  Robbie Benson in that  Yeah  But that was good  To have a blind figure  But you know what  Yeah  How funny would that be  Is one of these horrific movies  Leonard Part 6 
[03:11:30]  Or something  And they decide to remake it  And they're the ones  That can get better  Why make the good ones  Take the good ones  Leave them alone  You can only make them worse  We think it's a sin  Like one of my favorite  Comedies is  The In-Laws  And to remake that  It was like  What are you doing  It was all about  You know  Peter Falk  And Grodin  Not Grodin  Alan Arkin  Alan Arkin  Thank you  That made that movie  So why would you  Try to make that better  I don't get it  Or reinvent ones  That no one saw  Then that way  It's not  A blasphemy  Or you know  The biggest flop of the year 
[03:12:00]  They should look at the end of the year  What made  The least money  All year  The worst per screen average  Of a Hollywood release  And remake it  Remake it the next year  Yeah  And Spielberg is forced  To try to you know  Remake it  Only remake sequels  Like next year  They should do  Rush Hour 3 again  Yeah  Just really fun people  That was great  When he did Psycho  Remember he made it  The exact reshot  Every take  Oh yeah  And he told me  If it worked  He was going to do  Gay Psycho  Lesbian Psycho  Black Psycho  Spanish Psycho  Which would have been great 
[03:12:30]  But I like  I do like  The last one  In a sequel  You know  Part 8  When every bit  Of originality  Has been beaten  Out of it  Like the last  Airport one  With Charo  Saying  You miss  Come screw me  Sometimes it has  Moments  Hey at least  George Kennedy  Worked himself  Up to pilot  Like that was  He went from  Just the worker  That had to dig  A 707  Out of  Off the runway  And then  In the last one  I was like  Wait  George Kennedy  Is the pilot  He was like  He was in  Every single one 
[03:13:00]  Of them  He was the  Shovel guy  Yeah  Got a promotion  What was the  Robert Reed movie  Where he plays  A pilot  And the plane  Is going up  And there's  Something with  The altitude  Or altimeter  Where he can't  Aim down  He can't steer it down  So it's just  Going to keep  Going up  Into the atmosphere  Into space  Yeah I didn't see it  But I really want to  I love airplane crash movies  I'm really big on it  Like that's why  I want to be  Fearless is the best one  And Final Destination  Is pretty good too  And Alive  Is pretty good too  Yeah  Fearless I thought  Was the best though  Yeah me too  There's a scene  Where bridges 
[03:13:30]  The plane's going down  And it's the shaking  And he's looking out the window  And the way they show  The landscape  You're like  That is what it's like  To be going down  See that's the most  Horrific thing  Is when they can  Really depict  What you believe  A real plane crash  Would be like  In a movie  I was on one  The only time  It was ever really frightening  And it was horrible  Turbulence  Right before we landed  And the woman next to me  Grabbed the wrong drink  And I had vodka  And ice  And she took a big gulp  And I went  Oh my god  I'm an alcoholic  And she was just  Taking a huge  Sip of vodka  And I felt really bad  For it  She completely freaked out 
[03:14:00]  And I hope  That didn't send her  On a binge or something  When she got off the plane  She thought it was water  Because it looked like  She had a glass of ice water  And I had a glass of vodka  She probably took a huge mouth  Big straight vodka  And you know  And she  I felt really bad  Hopefully we'll die  Hopefully we'll just crash and die  And you won't have to worry about it  Exactly  You won't have to start your day count over  As we smash into this mountain  The cornfield  Are you really an alcoholic?  No  I'm not  No  She was  She was  The woman next to me was  Oh I missed the whole story  I thought you were mad  No  And she took a big gulp of my drink 
[03:14:30]  And then she said  Oh my god  I'm an alcoholic  Obi thought that you said  That you were mad  She drank your thing  Because you're an alcoholic  Yeah but that's funny too  Like oh my god  What are you doing  I'm an alcoholic  I thought you said  You're okay spider  No no no  You know you're a  I thought you said  Do you like something about Mary?  That was a good comedy  Yeah yeah yeah  Fucking very  Very kind of  Mean spirited to a certain degree  It was  I'm seeing that  But the load in the hair  Was like a thing  Wonderful  You know we've all experienced  And you know  But it looked  No we haven't  Completely weird  No we haven't 
[03:15:00]  What  Never jerked off  Doing a headstand  When you're young  As a kid  I'll be honest  Let me tell you  When you're young  It must have happened  I honestly got  I've hit myself in the eye  He came in with a bloodshot eye  One day  Because he was jerking off  And arced one  Right into his eyeball  No exaggeration  At least that's the official story  Laying back  Because whenever I whack my bag  My fucking feet point out  Like Christ on the cross  And I fucking smash myself  Right in the eye  That's a true story  That's a surprise  His name is Luca Bratz  That's a true story 
[03:15:30]  Amazing  Yeah you've had  Quite a career man  It's very impressive  Did you like Travolta  Sure he was great  You know I sat there  Where I got in drag  And the thing  And he was a lovely man  And the movie was made  Because he said yes  And he got a green lit  Because he said yes  And I think they did  A great job  They reinvented the musical  Which reinvented my movie  And made it seem new  And played it  But I thought they stuck to it  I was involved in the beginning 
[03:16:00]  And now we're doing Cry Baby  You know that's opening  In San Diego  And then it  And it opens on Broadway  In March  So I'm trying to get  Them all out there  I'm trying to get  Pink Flamingos  To be a children's movie  A children's cartoon movie  Just a battle of grossness  Take the sex out  Female trouble on ice  I'd like to see that  I'd like to get them all  Out there working  Are you surprised  Years later  That the movie  Still has a life  I'm proud  Like when you made it  Did you think  Like alright  This is going to be  Like a one off  And I'm proud of it  And everything  But  I made three fat girls 
[03:16:30]  A star  That's what I'm really proud of  And you know  I always talk  When it finally comes  To the schools  And everything  That finally the drag queen  Can get the lead role  In every high school  But that didn't happen  When I was young  Do you  I mean this is a stupid question  But if there's any movie  That you could say  Like that you've seen  That you could actually  Say like wow  I did that  Like is there any movie  That you've seen made  Like whether Godfather  Whatever that you like  Like that's a movie  I wish I had made  Well no  Because I write my own movies  So to me the most fun  A movie is thinking it up  You know  There's movies I love  But I'm never jealous 
[03:17:00]  Of other directors  Oh no I'm not even jealous  I just like  What's the movie  That you saw  That you thought  Like what a brilliant piece  That was  Well certainly David Lynch  I think certainly his career  I think Fassbender  I think Todd Haynes  Todd Solange's movies  I really really like  And think are funny  And wicked  And smart  But I don't want  To make those movies  But I  And I'm not jealous  Of them  But I really respect  Those directors  What was happening  In The Lost Highway  Can you please tell me  I don't know  They were driving  He's totally fixated  On that  All I think of  Is Robert Blake  In The Lost Highway  It was such a good movie 
[03:17:30]  It was so well shot  And then all of a sudden  Fucking Robert Loge  Is there  And they're driving  Down the side of the mountain  What the fuck happened  I was following this  Maybe  He just took acid  Or anything could happen  Maybe he just  Got bored with the plot  And thought I think  I'll fuck with you  There are movies  There are movies  Where I'm so into it  I'm sitting watching  And then all of a sudden  Maybe they start  Fading to black  And I go  It better be another scene  There better be  And then you see  Credits start rolling  And I go  Get the fuck out of here 
[03:18:00]  You're not doing this to me  Here's what you hear  When you hear credits  It's the most important moment  The moment when  That credit roll starts  Have you ever heard a movie  That doesn't have  Upbeat loud music  Because that's the moment  When you're walking  Out of the theater  When you say to your friend  If you liked it or not  That's when word of mouth begins  That ten seconds  Is when they can get you  To say  Did you like it  Afterwards  So you've never heard  A downbeat thing  On the thing  It's like  Makes you feel good  About yourself  And you leave  So you can say  Would you like it  Yeah it was pretty good  And that's when  Word of mouth begins 
[03:18:30]  The only thing you can't buy  And that's when it happens  By the time you get up  From your seat  To when you sit  When you walk outside  In the sun  That's when you've decided  Did you like it or not  Never even thought about that  So those tail credits  Are really trying to  Influence you with that music  That's really interesting  It's just  I would love to see  The end of a movie  Though sometimes  It's like  Wait a minute  You left out the end  I have to think about this  But those are the movies  That I will go to  Like IMDB  And I'll go  On the internet  That is so much  Wrong information  Oh I know  I know  But like 
[03:19:00]  I'll just go to  Try to read  Other people's  Interpretations  Of the movie  And sit there  And go  What did I miss  I had to miss  I'm not this stupid  I sit there  Saying I swear  I'm not this stupid  Well you maybe  Didn't miss anything  You know  Maybe that you're  Just so used to things  That explain everything  And hit you over the head  With it  That who cares  You don't even think about it  You forgot you saw it  By the time you get to outside  Yeah  Aren't there movies like that  That you forget  You saw them the next day  You know what I like  That's because you understood  It so well  You never think about it  The movie I liked a lot 
[03:19:30]  And just was reading  Other people's  Interpretations of it  Was Donnie Darko  Yeah that was  I thought that was a good movie  That movie that came back  And became a cult hit  Yeah  And everything you know  Yeah and it was like  What the fuck is happening  In this movie  Makes you kind of watch it  A few times  And it pisses you off  A little bit  I never saw it  Yeah it's a good one  I haven't seen that one yet  You know what I love  That the critics hated  Of course  I love at the end  Of Apocalypse Now  Marlon Brando  And Martin Sheen  In that room  For a half hour  And Brando's just 
[03:20:00]  Fucking rambling  And bald  And shot in the shadows  Because he's obese  Like I love that part  Of the movie  And the critics  Did you ever see him  In the Island of Dr. Moreau  I love the earpiece  I know  I remember  When the director  Was afraid to say  Marlon  Maybe that's not  A good decision  And he never said anything  So Marlon just went crazy  Didn't he just have  An earpiece  And they were just  Saying his lines  And he would repeat them  After someone read them  As an earpiece  Some of the outfits  And some of the things  He did was ad-libbing  That I think was  The director didn't have  The nerve to say no  No stick to the script 
[03:20:30]  Fatty  And so it went insane  Well he wouldn't allow  Frank Oz to direct him  In that movie  With Ed Norton  And De Niro  The score  He would only let  De Niro direct him  He was torturing Frank Oz  Calling him Miss Piggy  There's a body  That you can't control  I try not to hire  It's hard enough  To make a movie  Without that  He's just being a real douche  Oh that's nasty  Yeah  He's just being Brando  Oh fatty  Very good  Alright sir  Wait is she shy over there 
[03:21:00]  Yeah cause she loves  John Waters  And she was gonna  Ask a question  But she's like  Ask a question  Don't be shy  I'm too scared  Don't be  Don't be a scared  A scared  Just ask John Waters  A question  One question  He doesn't bite  And then I have to go home  Um  He's scared of you too  By the way  How did you get  Divine to eat shit  He asked that  She knows that  She's smashing me  I'm kidding  I'm kidding  I think that we were all on marijuana  To be honest  Not when we filmed it  When I thought it up 
[03:21:30]  When he said yes  And later that evening  He got on marijuana  And you know the famous story  He called the hospital  Cause he was afraid  And said my son is retarded  And just ate dog shit  What do I do  And the woman said  He might get the white worm  But I never got the white worm  Whatever that was  And he got tired  Of telling the story  She leaned toward the mic  She might have a real question  I did get worms once  You did  White worms  Did you have to hold  A glass of milk out  And then grab it  And pull it out 
[03:22:00]  When you  Out of your mouth  No they were just little  And they lived under  My fingernails  And in my butt  Wow  No they didn't  Yes  Yes  Pinworm  Yeah they do  I thought you had to wear  That thing on your head  That's ringworm  That's a look  You had cooties  I got that  Why did I never hear  Their story before  Until now  Yeah and where did you get  Them wearing  How old last week  I have them now  Sixth grade I think  Sixth grade  And the nerves  Did it spread through  The school  I don't know 
[03:22:30]  Well you didn't hear  You weren't ostracized  Yeah we took care of it  Were you just  Scratching your ass  All the time  And that's how  They got under your fingernails  Probably  I knew somebody  That had crabs  In her eyelashes  That's a great story  And you could see  Them right in her eyelashes  When you were talking  Well at least you knew  That you were a team player  You get crabs  In your eyelashes  That means you were  Fucking giving head  To somebody  I'm trimmed  Yeah exactly  Wow  That is really  Horrible  How'd you get rid of them 
[03:23:00]  I can't remember  They just left after a while  I did go to the doctors  I know that  They gave you some medicine  I would have  Yeah  I would have gathered  Some medicine  But is it like a pill  Or do you have to  Dip your ass in something  You have to put fish  In your pants  Until they eat all the worms  I don't know  But you're just not  Supposed to go barefoot  Around dogs  Maybe it was because  Of dog shit  Yeah I think so  I used to hate  Those my only friends  Well we're back to  Dog shit  How about a real question  I know  You're never going to  Now she's feeling comfortable 
[03:23:30]  She shared  So now she could ask  John Waters a question  Did you like  Were you happy with Pecker  Yeah I made Pecker  Yeah I mean  So I was happy with it  Yeah  The movie plays on television  The most of mine  Yeah it was about  Talking virgin mothers  And pubic hair harassment  Yeah  I liked it a lot  Thank you  It was so  It was different  From your other films  I don't know  They're all same to me  You know  But I  They have to be  A little different  Or who would  Get the next one  My sister had  Pinworm many years ago  There she goes  She did  My sister when she was a kid  And that's what it's from  It's from being in the dirt 
[03:24:00]  Probably  Or maybe a dog  Tracks something  Dirty little  I like Impatigo  What's that  Impatigo  Little scabs  That you get from  Like drinking in public  Water fountains  I don't know  In America  Impatigo  It's like scabs  You get on your face  And kids get it a lot  In grade school  And it spreads  From touching it  And I always thought  It had a certain cachet  All the rough kids  The bad boys  What's that on your face  Impatigo  Got a problem with that  We got staph infections 
[03:24:30]  Because people are not  Showering properly  In schools  What's that story  I don't know  It's an epidemic  Deadly  Antibiotic resistant infections  Right  But they're getting it  From not  Rinsing out their  Sweat  After gym class  Oh god  You know  That's something  If you wash your hands  Too much  You get every disease  You have to  Get rid of that good stuff  You know  A shot  A vaccination  Is a little bit  Of a disease  Yeah  You need a little  Of it  You need a little  Filth in your life  That's what that is  That hand washing 
[03:25:00]  Shit  That's all like  Third grade molested issues  Just get rid of those problems  Get rid of those problems  They're washing their problems  Really  Yeah  That's why they're doing that  Get rid of the problems  I see even if I go  On the New Jersey Turnburg  If I drive to New York  In the men's room  You see dads  Washing their hands  After just taking a pee  As if they had just  Performed an operation  Or something  Is their penis that dirty  I mean like  They're sitting there  With their sleeves rolled up  Like washing for an hour  After just taking a quick pee  I don't get it  I don't wash after a quick pee  I mean did they pee  On their hands 
[03:25:30]  I don't get it  You know  Are they  What happened  Well I can understand  Washing your hands  Needn't to the elbow  Not after you pee  Why  After you pee  Your dick is the cleanest part  Of your body  Absolutely  Dr. Hughes  Where did you find that out  Because your dick's not rubbing around  All day long  How is it the cleanest part  Of your body  Think about it  It's covered up in a sweaty area  After you shower  What else  It's right near the shithole  You shower  What else are you doing with it  On a normal day  Maybe you've had anal sex  And now there's little worms 
[03:26:00]  On your penis  It depends on  Who you're having anal with  Cute story  Sometimes  Do you ever run the water  But you don't wash your hands  So that other people  Don't think you're dirty  Yeah  I've seen that a lot  If they're in the stall  They're just here  And they saw you walk in  But nowadays  You don't really look near a stall  No no  Don't look  Don't tap your foot  Don't reach under  Here's the thing  What I want to know  About that case  Larry Craig  Yeah  Let's go  Is when I was young  Perverts  What they did in bathrooms  That one sat on the toilet 
[03:26:30]  Getting blown  And the other  The blowee  The one that came in  Always bought two shopping bags  So you put your leg  In each shopping bag  Did he have shopping bags  With him  Is what  This is an unanswered question  In this case  Yeah  If he did  Good luck  The shopping bag  Craig  Was fantastic  You stood it  From underneath  You looked through the stall  You just saw the two feet  Of humans  And two shopping bags  The other person  Standing with their feet  In a shopping bag  So you can't see  There's two people  In a booth  There's other stuff  In them too  Like cans of beans  But I've been in those bathrooms  I mean how could you  Really have sex 
[03:27:00]  There's families  There's so many people  Coming from one of the stalls  What's that  Going on over there  I mean any kind of sex  Even making out  You could hear  The stench  That's in there too  To have to deal with  God  What's going on over there  Banging up against the stall  And everything  It's probably quiet though  All you hear  All you hear  Is like the  The mouth  And the gentle  Like the legs  Leaning against the bag  You know  Like reaching into a paper bag  To pull an apple out  That's all you hear  A little sprinkle 
[03:27:30]  You sure did sex that up  Jimmy  As you lean forward  Your shins hit the bag  I've been on an airplane  And opened the door  And they didn't lock it  And somebody was jerking off  And I froze  And he froze  And I just closed the door  And I sat down  And he finished  He took a long time  And came out  You gotta finish  You gotta put that bolt  All the way over  You know if you put it  Halfway  The length of half comes on  Don't do that  If you're planning  Jerking off  On any sort of  That guy really had  A fucking  Jerk off  It was a long flight  Yeah  Would you have been 
[03:28:00]  Creeped out if you  Opened the door  And he said  Finally  I don't know  I have a friend  That says he always  Gets laid in the  First class lounge  I said  You do  I never see anyone  Cute  They're all  Fat businessmen  And you know  Now on planes  When you're in first class  If it turns into two beds  And they're right next  To each other  You think  Oh great  I'll be sleeping with you  Don't try anything  And you know  And they snore  And everything  It's horrible  What's your type  You don't like  Fat businessmen  Not really  A parole card helps  Really  I'm kidding  I'm bad boys  Well you know 
[03:28:30]  What I'm saying  Like they aren't  In first class  And so I always  Tell students  When you're in that  Last row in the middle  By the bathroom  You're cuter than  Anyone in first class  You know that  While you're suffering  So you prefer  A thuggier type  Of individual  Well I'm just saying  Compared to a  Fat businessman  Sure  Somebody with a little  Humor  A little street smart  It's fun  I don't think  Anyone's into  Fat businessmen  Sure they are  Chubby chasers  All girls  That like power  That's what  Turn on so many women  That's amazing to me  Is power 
[03:29:00]  Turns them on  And you see them  With monsters  Carlo Ponte  And Sophie Loren  There's a perfect example  Does the strange woman  In the back  Have any other questions  For John Waters  I don't know  I like your pants  And shoes and socks  Thank you very much  That's sort of  Backhanded  That means you don't  Like his shirt  And jacket  Your shirt sucks  No I'm kidding  You're awful  Who is that girl  I don't know  I don't know 
[03:29:30]  But she had  Pinworms in her ass  Jim you were just  Surmising about  The bathroom situation  You've never been  In that situation  No  Absolutely not  But I was amazed  When I heard it  But there was no  Glory hole there  I mean that's a  Whole different issue  There's no glory holes  In airports  I think it's  No they'll slap a  Patch on that  Real quick  What the men's rooms  Have become  Where they're just  Now like there's  Cinder blocks  From the floor  To the ceiling  To keep guys  Away from other guys  You know those guys  Are called 
[03:30:00]  Tea room queens  That's the name  Tea room  Yeah  That's the term  For that  It's hilarious  Because it started  Where they had  It used to be  You just took a leak  You didn't think  Anything of it  And then they put  Up a little border  Now we're up to  Where it's cinder blocks  From the ceiling  To the floor  Yeah but didn't  When you were young  I mean in libraries  Everybody  Everyone had their  First sexual experience  In the library  I don't know  When I was young  Book reports  And blowjobs  Just went hand in hand  I mean it seemed  Like libraries  Always had that issue  I would scope out  They were tea rooms  They still are  I think libraries  There's a lot of action 
[03:30:30]  Libraries are good  For finding some kind  Of stimulus  Like I would go  To the photography  Section  And open up  And you would  Absolutely find nudes  Nude photographs  Doesn't matter  What library you're in  It could be  The school library even  You open it up  There it is  One time when I was  God I had to be  In third grade or something  They were teaching us  How to use the library  And wanted us to  Take a book out  So they taught us  The card catalog  And I found a book  With a silhouette 
[03:31:00]  Of a naked Indian girl  On it  And that was  Hardcore porn  And it was just like  It was a silhouette of her  And the book was  Way out of my league  Like it was  An adult book  Of poetry or something  And I'm in the third grade  And I was like  Okay this  And I'm shaking  Because I just wanted  To take it home  And stare at the  Naked Indian girl  On the cover  That's what libraries  Are for  In the beginning  You know  When you're a kid  To look up things  You're not supposed  To look up  I used to like  Reading dirty words 
[03:31:30]  That was my thing  In the dictionary  You'd look up  And see if you could  Find dirty words  Just reading dirty words  Was really cool  And now they have  So many dictionaries  Of slang words  I mean you know  They have ones  That you've never  Yeah yeah  In the canyon  And all them  I use them  In a dirty shame  I try to come up  With new terms  For everything  New ones  Yeah they're kind of  Hard now  That they've come up  With all kinds of  Dirty Sanchez  Yeah  Yodeling in the canyon  Different ones for  Cunnilingus  There's a lot  Yeah  Sneezing in the cabbage  There was a lot of  Good ones  I like that one 
[03:32:00]  You come up with that one  No I have a dictionary  There's a great book  Called The Book of Filth  That has great terms  For everything  Yeah that's really funny  Stranger anything else  Well I think it's  I'm surprised that you  Sound sort of conservative  In a way like sort of  That you're grossed out  By the prostitution  And you don't like  Watching violence  And stuff  No I don't  Yeah maybe I am  You know I'm not  I don't like real violence  And I love fake violence  I like prostitution 
[03:32:30]  If they're in control  Of it themselves  I don't  You know so  Basically I do have  Maybe limitations  To my debauchery  Are people surprised  By that  Like when you're  When you're  I don't know if you're  Involved with someone  But like when you're  Dating or making friends  Are people surprised  By your  No I don't think  They are because  You know I'm a  Filth elder  I'm trying to be  A good bad example  For young people  And so  I don't know  That they're surprised  They may be  I think more 
[03:33:00]  A long time ago  Like when Pink Flamingos  First came out  And I'd go to colleges  They'd pick me up  At the airport  With so much drugs  And I'd think  Oh my god  I'm on a lecture  Theory  I really can't  Stay up till five  In the morning  So maybe then  But not so much now  I think  Yeah  We gotta get  John out of here  It's amazing  When they think  You're gonna be  A real pig  And all you want  Is a frappuccino  No no  Not fat please  Yeah  Figure  What's the big plug  Of course  This Filthy World  Is out on DVD  Available in stores now  And on Amazon.com  October 30th  Okay oh yeah  I should have read  The next line 
[03:33:30]  Next Tuesday  October 30th  I'm gonna check that out  Actually  I think you're gonna land  I thought you were  I was gonna watch this  I thought you were in tomorrow  I'm really annoyed  Because I thought we had  George Carlin today  And you tomorrow  So I didn't watch this yet  Look at the cover  It has the most hideous  Hilarious painting of me  I like it  That is really like  It's creepy  Director of the dam  Yeah  Right  It's a funny one  It makes me laugh  John you were very interesting  I gotta tell you  I don't know much  About your work  I just always knew  Whoa it's that guy  Yeah I knew  And I knew your name  And all that  But I didn't  If someone actually said 
[03:34:00]  What did John Waters do  After Divine  I'd be like  Die  And then there was  I don't know  But you know what  Now I'm gonna check out  A bunch of your stuff  After talking to you today  And John is doing  Some signings  They asked us to plug  Which of course we will  Personal appearance  At DVD signing events  In New York  It's gonna be  A Wednesday  November the 7th  So just write that down  Because it's obviously  Not in the next couple weeks  And in Los Angeles  Along with Jeff Garland  Who directed this  From Curb Your Enthusiasm  Directed this filthy one  Yes  Just to make sure  On November the 9th 
[03:34:30]  And the New York event  Is gonna take place  At 6 o'clock  At a Borders  That's again  Wednesday November 7th  It's at Madison Square Garden  One that I did  My book signing at  If anybody was there  How was it  When you did it there  It's all the commuters  Yeah you got a lot  It was much better  Than I thought  I was terrified  There was just gonna be  Me and 50 people  Running by for a train  Ignoring it  It was actually good  It was good  It was really good  And also the Los Angeles  Signing will take place  At 7pm at the Barnes & Noble  At the Grove  At Farmers Market  They should reword this  This is weirdly worded 
[03:35:00]  Because they list  Both the dates  And then they list  Like your travel plans  And then like  It'll be at the Borders  But then again  Not the one  It'd be actually easier  If they listed the bookstores  It wasn't at  Right  But Carousel  He will not be appearing  Yes  Do you have a website?

[03:36:30]  With an H and a 101 over it  Yeah come on in Lee  You can bore some people  For ten minutes  Hey  We already did a good show  We don't have to worry  About this segment  So come on in  Lee I was talking to George Carlin  About you today  Oh what do you have to say  I said how  He sent you  In a very interesting article  He wrote a few years back  About local news  I read the whole thing  Every single word  Loved it  And I said that you were the one  That turned me on to it  Cool  Wait did Carlin send it to you 
[03:37:00]  Or did you find it  No it's something Carlin wrote  Yeah it's unbelievable  How the news is not the news  Yeah he was just plagiarizing it  Yeah basically  Oh Lee wrote it  His blog is his  Yeah  No I took something  He took a couple of  No we're just thinking alike  You know  I was thinking of  And he was nice enough  To send well  Here's what I wrote  And his was brilliant  Did you footnote your blog  You had a footnote  This was George Carlin  Yeah  Yeah I heard you said  I'm terrible on the radio  But you like 
[03:37:30]  Anthony was telling  No no no no  I said on the phone  Ah okay  Phone's a different story  Jimmy was the one  Jimmy was the one  That actually said  You were awful on the radio  I never said that actually  I enjoyed it  He was great on HBO  Thank you  I never said you  He thinks you were great on HBO  You can't give him a compliment back Jimmy  The air traffic controller  Is telling me he's terrible  On the radio  Actually I'm good  At that kind of radio  Are you good at that  Oh yeah  I got that nailed  Totally  You don't put the tower to sleep  No no  I keep them all entertained  It's great  We love it 
[03:38:00]  I'll tell you this summer  When I had to drive  I don't know  12 hours to the Outer Banks  I was cursing you  I'm like why  Why can't I feel like  He's a good pilot  And he's not high up there  I would have been down there  In a second  This guy's probably  More hours flying  Than airline pilots  I just have this vision  That he's high  And flying  Just haphazardly  Around the country  Haphazardly  Because of that  I have to suffer  And do a 12 hour  Freaking car ride  I'm saying I'm the problem  Lee  Not you  I know you're a good flyer  How many plays 
[03:38:30]  Plane you got  What's that  How many seats  Four  And he's got  He's got the parachute  He's got the parachute  And if we go flying  I won't drink  Wow  Alright  Do you drink  No  Are you kidding  He cuts off  40 minutes before  I know there are  FFA guys  That listen to this show  Yeah we got everyone  Convinced that you're  Just a horrible flyer  But the reality is  What you started  When you were 15  Or something  Yeah  So you've been  Doing it for what  Drinking  Not flying  40 years  Yeah  A little joke  Yeah very good 
[03:39:00]  I didn't hear that  Yeah the guy's been  Flying forever  For 40 years  Don't they say 12 hours  From bottle to throttle  Yeah  Now I've been drinking  And gone 12 hours  And couldn't even  Drive home  Oh yeah  I don't understand  How that's the legal  Limit  That's based on a beer  Yeah  I guess it's not like  It's different  Like what are the odds  You're going to actually  Hit something while you're flying  It's a lot harder  To hit something  Once you're off the ground  I guess you know  You're just  Getting off the ground  Is just landing  Yeah landing  Is it true 
[03:39:30]  Yeah  Is it true  Some of the pilots  Would huff a little  Of the oxygen  If they were feeling  A little hungover  From the night before  Back in the old days  With the sexy stews  And everything  Oh yeah  Yeah back in those  Groovy days  Actually Air France  Up until I guess  A couple years ago  They allowed champagne  In the cockpit  Wow  Yeah  They just have a little  Air of the dog  That's a little weird  Yeah  Hey I have a problem  No  Except for one  Dog shit sniffer 
[03:40:00]  SST  From instant feedback  This seems a little familiar  But I'll just read it  Okay  He writes  Hey it's great to hear  From Lee  He always brings  I forgot about that  He spelled Jimmy's bit  Yeah it's my thing  No no  I wasn't saying anything  I was only saying  That you did call in one time  And you were talking about  I think it was flying  And you were talking about  Different flight patterns  You guys started it  I could have been talking 
[03:40:30]  About yes  Oh yeah  That's when we hung up  On your last  That's right  I'm not a huge yes fan  No I know  He was actually  He approached  I wanted to get a picture  With him at the XM thing  And he goes  Oh you're my favorite  Comedian on Tough Crowd  Oh you bastard  I love you  That's John Anderson  Yeah  Wow John Anderson  Knows who the fuck you are  He's a fan  And you instantly  Became a yes fan  That annoys me  That's how it works  With Jimmy  If you say that  Then I bet you  Jimmy bought the whole  Yes catalog  No I'm a Sabbath  Still a Sabbath guy  You know actually  Before they kind of  Started sucking 
[03:41:00]  Which late 70s  They were great  Yeah they used to  Tour with Yes  Yes before they  Yes Sabbath sucks  No yes  No yes sucked  What  Yes was great  Then they started  Who  Yeah  They used to tour  Who  Yeah  They would do that  Gag  I was only crying  Right  What  Sabbath did  No and then they switched  Initially Yes  Open for Sabbath  That's right  Yes  Yes  They were both  From that  English  So you'll admit  When did Yes  Start sucking  Um  76 
[03:41:30]  77  76  Wow that early  What did they put out  After 76  That we know  Owner of a lonely  Oh yeah that was  You don't even want  To bring that up  He likes that right  Damn that record  He doesn't want to  Don't bring that up  It's just like a  Disco record  It's so not  It would be like  Sabbath doing  You Light Up My Life  I like that  I have Aussie doing  Blue suede shoes  From the fucking 60s  That would be good  It's fantastic  Owner of a lonely heart  But there was a song  Off there that was  Actually there were  A couple of cool songs  On that one though  It kind of ruined me  Name a couple songs  That were kind of obscure 
[03:42:00]  That AOR was kind of  Playing like  Changes  No but after that  There was a song  That was like  Wow this is a cool song  It's too bad that  It'll never get airplay  Um  Hold On  There were a lot of those  Hold On  That was a good one  Hold On was a good one  Can I get the track list  Of Yes  I know this is going to  Interest me  And maybe two other  People out there  Was it another 20 minutes  No it was just a  It was a poppy song  It can happen  Oh  It could happen  Or Rhythm of Love  Oh whatever  I'll discuss that  With you  But early Yes  You know  Yes album 
[03:42:30]  Fragile  Close to the Edge  Unbelievable  And then they kind of  Lost direction  Can we be honest here  And let's just say  For the record  Fleetwood Mac  Fucking stinks  They are fucking terrible  Rumors  One of the greatest albums  Ever made  Oh they're  What's one song of that  Don't stop  I mean  Boom boom boom  Every fucking time  I hear that  I want to smash you  On a wall  They are horrendous  Yeah they used to do  A lot of drugs  Good  Oh my god 
[03:43:00]  Yeah  Oh  You did it with them  Right  I was an observer  With a doctor present  With a doctor present  Fucking lame man  Yes  Under the clinical supervision  Of a trained professional physician  Yeah  So  Yeah  As a matter of fact  They stopped making good records  When they stopped doing drugs  Yes  That's a lot of bad  No actually  Yeah  Oh  Fleetwood Mac  Fleetwood Mac  Fleetwood Mac  Well I think  What fucked yes  Was they had to like 
[03:43:30]  Fit into the kind of  The commercial world  Of radio right  You couldn't do  You couldn't put out  A 27 fucking minute single  Well that's what the fans wanted  They got all these mixed messages  And a record company says  Ah the kids are dancing now  Make a dance record  Fans are saying  No we want 20 minute epics  And two of the guys in the band  Well we're yes  We want to do it this way  And then  Oh we better listen to the record company  We should do it this way  And the result was just a mishmash  You gotta follow your heart man  Yeah  Oh man  Let me tell you  Look at Pink Floyd  I mean they never compromised 
[03:44:00]  Label told them  They never did their disco record  Well you know make three minute songs  And they told them  Here I got one  The greatest example of that  Was when Rap came out  We talk about this one all the time  And Rush went with Roll the Bones  With that rap shit in the middle  The rap in the middle  And I was a huge Rush fan  I couldn't even look at him after that  I'm like what are you doing  Do we have that  Because I remember we talked about that  Relax  Get to it  It's so completely bad  And out of place  I don't remember that  I don't care about it as a joke though  I don't think anybody got it  You think they did a joke  A joke that no one got  A joke that no one gets 
[03:44:30]  Is not a joke  Yeah that's very good  That's true  It's a statement that you're trying to explain  Because you're embarrassed  Yeah that  Exactly  That's what I was going to say  You got it  Alright go ahead Iraq  A little Roll the Bones  This is Rush  Oh  This is so bad  This is fucking good  This is better than  Anything  Better than moving light 
[03:45:00]  Better than moving pictures  Better than living in the limelight  Come on  Tom Sawyer  Mean Mean Dry  This is not ironic  This is real  Yeah I think you're right  There's nothing ironic about that  Yeah he's trying to  That's fucking awesome  He's trying to really be serious  Are there other examples of that  That's the one we always use  But you can help us with this bit  When we go back to it  Oh of compromising to meet the public  Yeah  How about Blondie when she did rap  Yeah that was a good one 
[03:45:30]  Some people say she really brought rap to the mainstream  That's right  With that rapture  What was it  Oh rapture you're right  Let me tell you  One word  Starship  Now that's a band  Oh fuck  We built this city  Yeah  I like the alternative version  That we have  That some fans sent in  Ah  You want to hear our version  Of we built this city  Yeah  We didn't write it  But someone fan did  And it was much better  We're trying to get this on regular radio  Maybe you could help us out  Yeah  Yeah sure  Connections  This should be on the 80's 
[03:46:00]  It should be on the 80's channel  Here we go  His dick's all shitting  And then he just sings about his dick being shitty from your asshole  It's got a lot of potential  That's good  Could be huge  80's on 8 
[03:46:30]  That's where I see that being played  Absolutely  I brought it up  When we were talking about  We built this city  Where each market had their own traffic report  That they could squeeze into the middle of the song  Oh because there was the talking part  Where it was the traffic report  Talking about San Francisco  And I'm like  I'm in Rochester doing radio  You know  When that record came out  I'm like  But we don't really have traffic here  But they're talking about  All the local roads and stuff  Trying to make it local  All I have to do is say  Overturn truck on the interstate  It kind of fits anywhere  Right  Yeah  But they wanted the local streets  Yeah  The road system up there 
[03:47:00]  Is called the can of worms  So they had to work the can of worms  Into that song  Yeah  That's a problem  That's also what  Jimmy's girlfriend had  Are you falling asleep over there  Oh boy  She's tired  She only got a couple hours last night  Nothing says that we're doing  Bad radio more than when someone  Falls asleep in front of our eyes  Especially a show member  Right  It happens 
[03:47:30]  I dozed you the day for about 30 seconds  Yeah  It's hard sometimes  By this time I'm dragging  Oh believe me  I was whipping the camera around  Trying to get you really quick  I need a little vindication  Didn't work  You woke up you bastard  Yeah  You'll be asleep  You'll be like dead asleep  And then you'll go  So when that album came out  You'll just wake up  With a question  There are times where it appears  I'm sleeping  Where I'm just really  I'm just relaxing  But I'm listening  I'm soaking it in  I'm resting my eyes 
[03:48:00]  I'm resting my eyes  Nothing gets past these people  I said Tom Sawyer  Mean mean dry  I don't know how to say it  I don't know how to sing half these songs  You know the question about  Good bands that have ruined their career  By going disco or rap  That's good  I didn't think about that  Oh we gave you something good  Yeah  Your next blog  Could be all about it  That's right  I have a contest  There have been a few  Kiss went disco man  Kiss put out a disco song  It's a good song though  I was made for loving you  It's a good song  I was made for loving you  It had the disco beat 
[03:48:30]  You were made for loving me  It had a disco beat to it  Rod Stewart  Yeah Rod Stewart  Oh he sucks  He was always terrible  He was always terrible  Lee what else you got  Well what do you want to know  Give us something interesting  Well let's see  Simulate my brain right now  What do you got  Right now  Oh okay  What do you got  Anything from yes  To the  Do you think the terrorists  Are responsible for the wildfires  I think they are  Yeah I think they  They obviously have something 
[03:49:00]  To do with it  Well you know  The whole terrorist thing  This whole presidential election  Thing is kind of interesting  Is it  Yeah  I mean it's  Everybody's on the  Gotta get into the middle  You know it's all that  Being in sync thing  You hear some of these guys  Talk and then all of a sudden  It's like  The fuck did you say that for  Nobody's gonna buy that  That's  And this  I don't pay attention  To the process anymore  I gotta be honest with you  And we were talking about  POTUS channel  POTUS  Thanks  Oh  Oh jeez  Did you hear what the
