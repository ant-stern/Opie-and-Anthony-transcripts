<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton complaining about their early morning wake-up call and the lack of a proper "buzz" due to their previous night's drinking. They discussed their "Whip Em Out Wednesday" promotion, involving "wow" stickers placed on cars, and recounted listener encounters, including a chance meeting with someone they’d previously criticized on-air.  The conversation moved to a discussion of auditions for a fat woman in a TV commercial, followed by opinions on Eddie Vedder's perceived arrogance and Neil Young's concert choices,  highlighted by a listener's anecdote about a Neil Young concert lacking popular songs.  This led to a debate about artists' obligations to their audience and ticket pricing.  Further segments included listener feedback on "Whip Em Out Wednesday," a caller from Pittsburgh confirming the sticker distribution, Jim Norton's impromptu drum session enhanced by Coke Logic, a mention of their E! appearance and Kevin Smith's reaction,  a review of *Monster House*,  a comparison of *The Daily Show* and *The Colbert Report*, and a discussion about a Central Park robbery prompted by a cigarette request, concluding with a call from Grand Rapids.

The show continued with a scathing critique of the Miss Universe Pageant's commentary team, described as "dull" and "emasculating,"  with sexually explicit jokes about the contestants' bodies. They contrasted the commentary with their own envisioned version featuring construction workers or Con Ed employees.  The hosts also satirized news coverage of a Queens power outage, interrupting the British Open.  A phone call with Andrew Dice Clay followed, revealing his unexpected homosexuality and leading to a rambling, sexually explicit monologue.  The segment concluded with promotion of "Whip Them Out Wednesday" and their comedy tour, and a brief interview with Mike Rowe of "Dirty Jobs" and "Shark Week," discussing his experiences filming "Shark Week" and the dangers of shark encounters.

Mike Rowe's appearance extended into the next segment, focusing on his experiences filming "Deadliest Catch," highlighting both serious injuries and humorous mishaps.  The conversation then shifted to "Dirty Jobs," detailing the challenging and often disgusting aspects of the jobs, including a skull cleaning business.  He discussed the resilience of the workers and the financial rewards, affected by new legislation.  A phone call from Bob Saget followed, promoting his stand-up shows and a raunchy, R-rated penguin movie.  Rowe further recounted past jobs, including his time with the Baltimore Opera and QVC, and shared more "Dirty Jobs" stories, such as working with a lift pump and artificially inseminating animals.  The segment also included the "Dump Report" detailing censored parts of the show, several other callers, a brief appearance by General Bam, and the hosts' walk to their XM studio, filled with off-color comments.

Mike Rowe continued as a guest, with callers praising his work ethic and discussing the most challenging jobs he'd undertaken, such as railroad tie removal. A caller abruptly asked about Rowe's penis size, leading to evasive answers.  The conversation shifted to "Shark Week," including a Robert Shaw anecdote from the filming of *Jaws*. This led to a discussion of Shaw's career and death.  Rowe discussed an on-camera vomiting incident, the worst smell encountered (a grease trap),  and a harrowing alligator wrangling experience.  He highlighted two jobs he wouldn't repeat: ostrich wrangling and catfish noodling, detailing the dangers of noodling.  John Mayer then joined the show, discussing his fandom of Opie and Anthony, his prom experiences, and his stand-up comedy.  They discussed the challenges of stand-up, contrasting it with his music career, a negative blog post about his comedy, and different types of comedy.  There was also a humorous exchange about Mayer's interactions with fans and reliance on young drivers during tours.  The segment concluded with more calls and lighthearted banter.

The final segment featured John Mayer discussing a caller's request to tell his girlfriend to stop being a "bitch." This led to musical interludes and a crude message to the girlfriend. The conversation shifted to Mayer's career, his creative process for "Continuum," encounters with critics (including Joel Siegel), and the impact of the internet on criticism. A caller apologized for leaving a Counting Crows concert before Mayer's performance, leading to a discussion about bands continuing after the death or departure of key members (The Who, Black Sabbath, Journey). Mayer shared anecdotes about loud concerts and hearing damage. The segment concluded with a discussion of Mayer's MySpace page, interactions with fans, and the absurdities of online interactions, concluding with Mayer promoting his new album and a vulgar sign-off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of disease.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  It's a bunch of idiots. 
[00:00:30]  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The O.P. and Anthony program.  Elvidos.  The O.P. and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  O.P.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one,  with Down syndrome children. 
[00:01:00]  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah.  There it is.  There's our music.  A little delay there.  Dun, dun, dun.  I forgot to eat.  Are you kidding?  No, I got my stupid bagel here.  I was reading the paper.  The papers.  And, uh, yeah, I forgot to eat. 
[00:01:30]  So I'll be nibbling.  I looked at my Honey Nut Cheerios and my blueberries about 15 minutes ago and I went,  oh, I have to eat.  Oh, this again.  Eating is such a chore.  I'm bored with it, all right?  I'm bored with it.  It's not even that.  During the day, eating is eating.  It's enjoyable.  Yeah.  You search out stuff you like to eat.  At this time of the morning, it is a major chore.  Just a chore. 
[00:02:00]  You're like, ugh.  Food.  Because it's still last night when we eat.  Here's something.  Before you take in more food, you should be able to release some of the food you ate.  You ate last night.  Right.  I need to release some of the food I ate.  Oh, about two, three days ago.  Oh, but on the weekends, no problem whatsoever.  Oh, when we go on vacation, no problem whatsoever.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Does work bind you up?  I don't know what it is.  But I'm dizzy.  I got so much going on inside, I'm dizzy.  Yuck.  Well, good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  The phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi.  What's up, Jim Norton?  Hi.  Morning.  Are you?  Were you up late, too?  Not that bad.  One. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  One?  That's pretty late.  Yeah, I'm going to nap.  Oh, you're going to nap.  I did a little drinking last night.  Just a little.  Drinking.  Went out to dinner and just two faggot glasses of wine.  But we get up so early, like, it doesn't have time to even get out of your system.  No.  Like, you can't even get a good little buzz going.  That's all I'm asking.  I'm not talking complete intoxication.  I'm just talking a little buzz. 
[00:03:30]  A little heady.  Just a little buzz to make everything feel just a little better.  Just a little better.  Put a little smile on your face, a little squint in your eyes.  Take the old edge off.  That's it.  Makes the shows you're watching on TV a little funnier.  Yeah.  That's all.  Take the edge off so you can enjoy some buttery beets.  Buttery beets.  No buttery beets.  No buttery beets today?  I hate the buttery beets.  What about some lush looks?  No lush looks.  When you're drinking your wine, does everything look a little better?  You're like, wow, man, I got some lush looks around me. 
[00:04:00]  Well, no lush looks.  Mm-mm.  But you just want to, you know, have a couple of glasses, feel good.  And then you realize you just don't have enough time to sleep it all off,  even though it's only two stupid glasses.  You can drink bottles.  You can drink Jack.  Jacks and Cokes, Wham-O, with shots of Jack with it.  Jägermeister, things like that.  And then, you know, you just stay in bed the next day or something. 
[00:04:30]  But this, it's like, oh, the alarm goes off.  Oh, it's still nighttime.  And then you get up and you feel like crap.  Got to just sit and wait for it to go away.  I went for an 8 o'clock bedtime last night.  That's great.  Infant bedtime.  I know.  I don't do it often.  I was telling you in the back office, I look forward to the sun going down a  little earlier.  So at least when, you know, we go to bed, by the way, we go to bed separately in  our separate abodes.  Yes, yes. 
[00:05:00]  Mine's a hotel room and Anthony's a real nice house on Long Island.  Oh, no.  But I look forward to the sun starting to go down before 8 o'clock.  So when you do have to go to bed early, it at least feels like night.  I was walking around the streets of Manhattan getting a little dinner and then I'm just  walking around the neighborhood and people are just starting their dinner and they're  walking around with their ice cream cones enjoying the summer night in Manhattan.  Yeah.  I'm like, well, time to go to bed.  Bedtime.  Doesn't make any sense. 
[00:05:30]  Like, kids are still playing.  Stupid schedule.  You hear him in the street playing.  I go up to bed and I turn on the TV because I like going to sleep to the TV and there's  a glare off the screen from the sun.  It's like, this shouldn't be.  It's like I'm seven years old again and being sent to bed.  I say we go back to being irresponsible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go to bed.  Midnight.  One.  Whenever.  Come in late.  Yeah.  Just do the show in a haze. 
[00:06:00]  Complete haze.  Why not?  Hey, it's Whip Em Out Wednesday, isn't it?  We're up to Wednesday?  Yes, it is.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  That Monday thing we did, the golf thing, kind of threw everything off by a day.  So now it seems like Tuesday to us, but nope.  It's Wednesday, all right.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  The greatest radio promotion ever continues.  Continues.  And you were just saying that you're seeing more wow stickers around the New York area,  right?  Oh, yeah.  Driving home, driving around Manhattan, seeing a lot more wow stickers on the vehicles. 
[00:06:30]  It upsets me when they pull bonehead moves, because I really want to yell at him or beep  or something.  It's like, ah, he's got a wow sticker.  He's a friend.  See, I gave up with the excitement thing, because when I'm driving around, I see a wow sticker.  I go driving up so they can see me, and I'm beeping like a lunatic, and it's always  one of our listeners, they look over and just go, faggot.  I'm like, no, ass.  That's our promotion.  I'm excited that you're part of the wow promotion. 
[00:07:00]  I want to say, hey.  Wow.  I would never do that.  But most of our listeners don't really know what we look like.  Yeah.  I know we're all over the message boards and websites and stuff, but the reality is most  listeners have no idea what we look like.  That's going to change.  So it's like, yeah.  It's been changing with the buses, too, because yesterday I tried milking it a little bit.  There was a bus, and it was one of the ads of our pictures on the back of the bus.  You see that one yet?  Yeah, yeah.  It's giant, you know?  This is Open Anthony, and there we are, our pictures. 
[00:07:30]  So this guy pulls up behind the bus, and now I'm even with the guy.  So he's right behind the picture of us, and I'm right next to him.  So I'm kind of looking at him, hoping to get some kind of reaction, you know?  Hoping to cash in on some celebrity, make me feel good about myself, that I'm semi-famous  because I'm on the back of a bus.  You might be somebody.  Maybe.  I could be.  We might be somebody, finally. 
[00:08:00]  He's just so miserable in his commute.  He glances over, just looks back at the back of the bus, not even noticing.  Yeah.  One of those guys, you know, could be a wanted poster of a killer, and he could just look  next to me, and he'd see me.  Nothing.  He gets nothing.  I got no satisfaction out of it.  Then I felt stupid.  Our lives are really stupid.  They're ridiculously stupid.  Just changing gears, and then we'll get into this wow thing for the new listeners.  But after the show yesterday, we had a meeting for this TV commercial they want to do. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  We can't give it away.  Can we say that we're looking at fat chicks for about an hour?  We could say that.  That doesn't give away anything.  And it was great because we're looking at their auditions, I guess.  It was kind of like...  We could say that, right?  It wasn't like an audition.  It was more of just, what do they look like?  They were standing in front of a blue screen so you could really get their outline.  Yeah.  Because we need a fat broad.  And Anthony and I were saying things like, ah, you know, that one, her ass is fat, but 
[00:09:00]  it's flat.  It's wide.  She looks great from the front.  She's got big thighs and a big wide ass.  But when she turns around, you look at her from the side, it's kind of flat.  We need more of a bubble ass.  Right.  And then we're like, and that girl, she's fat and all, but she's not believable as a fat  girl.  Yeah, not believable.  And she, I don't know, she comes off a little too acty. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And then the other one is a nice sloppy mess.  Man, is she a slob.  With the big hands.  I like the slob.  Do you like the slob?  Or I kind of liked the first one.  Did you like the first one?  The one that was attractive if she was trapped on an island with nothing but coconuts.  I like.  To eat for like a year.  I like the other blonde.  Yeah?  She was just such a mess. 
[00:10:00]  I think she's going to be perfect.  All right.  This is our, this is our lives.  We were looking at fat chicks for what?  A half hour, 40 minutes yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's kind of fat, but she's kind of shapely fat.  Looking at fat broads.  People might get confused.  I mean, shapely fat is.  We need.  It's not as good as like just fat.  We need big fat ass.  That's what we need.  And we need a pretty face.  Yeah.  So we got to figure this whole thing out.  Yeah.  We're working it out. 
[00:10:30]  So then we leave that meeting and we're walking back to, you know, well, I guess we're in parks.  And all of a sudden, well, one guy came up and said, you know, hey, are you Opie and Anthony?  And it turns out we used to trash his what, girlfriend?  His girlfriend.  In Boston.  Because she was on the radio.  Yeah.  And I'm like, oh, oh, this is never comfortable.  Sorry about that.  And then I guess we trashed him when he was doing afternoons in Boston.  Yeah.  And then.  He should have punched us, by the way. 
[00:11:00]  Like, if anyone should have punched us, it should have been him.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We should have been hit by that gentleman.  Well, we escaped with our lives.  And then we continue down the sidewalk.  And this kid, what was his name?  I want to remember his name.  John?  That sounds good.  John goes, Opie, Anthony, I'm a huge fan.  And Anthony and I are like, hey, thanks, man.  Appreciate it.  And then I notice the guy's, he's got an iPod.  I'm like, you're a huge fan.  You're listening to your iPod. 
[00:11:30]  And I yell at him as he's, like, now 10, 15 feet ahead of us.  He stops dead in his tracks, turns around, and just shoves the iPod in my face.  And what track is it?  Opie and Anthony, July, whatever.  Yeah.  It looked like July 17th, 18th, something like that.  You know, our whole show from about a week ago on his iPod.  I'm like, all right, I guess you are an Uber fan.  Yeah.  So a big hi to John that we met with his iPod.  Hey there, Jan.  All right, going back to the wow.  So it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  You get a wow sticker on your car or your truck or your bike. 
[00:12:00]  We don't care.  On your motorcycle helmet.  The possibilities are endless.  If you can't get a wow sticker, make a homemade wow sign or write wow in the back of the truck  in the dirt and what have you, and then you just kind of forget about it, basically.  The wow sticker supports the show, and it also tells the ladies that you want to see  some boobies as you're driving.  Right.  It's like fishing.  This has worked for many, many years.  Many years.  We don't focus a lot of time on it nowadays because we have so much radio we want to try 
[00:12:30]  to do.  But honestly, if there's women out there that are looking to flash and they're looking  for wow stickers, you certainly could call us today.  Anyway, Free FM here in New York, where we're broadcasting from right now, they're doing  a great job as far as getting the wow stickers out.  I don't know if the other stations are.  I have no idea.  I know Philly does a really good job.  I know BCN's doing a really good job.  Is Pittsburgh doing a really good job with the wow stickers?  I say yes.  How about Cleveland?  How about Columbus?  How about West Palm Beach?  The list goes on and on and on. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I guess whatever radio station you're listening to, go to their website and see if they're doing  the wow sticker thing for us.  Okay?  Most of the stations are.  They're totally into it.  We still need one basic PO box where the listeners from all over the country could just sit in  their self-addressed stamped envelopes and get wow stickers.  We do that over at XM.  It works like a charm.  Like a charm.  I know.  Well, it's early.  Come on.  I'm still digesting my Honey Nut Cheerios.  Is she back on traffic? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  What happened?  I told you.  I made a prediction.  No, I told you.  Why would they take her off?  Because the other one has a contract.  Contract schmontract.  She's custom made for the job.  What's the other one?  Now I got to see what she looks like.  What?  The one she was taking over for?  Yeah.  Emily Francis.  I don't know.  I know their names and everything.  I don't know names or what they look like.  I'll have to look at her.  We're talking about the traffic girl, Jill. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, here on Channel 11.  Nicolini or something like that.  Yeah.  Who was naked in Playboy.  Naked.  And she now does traffic on WB-11 here in New York.  She filled in for the entertainment reporter.  And she was all like glammed up.  She wore like gowns and jewelry.  She was all hot.  And now she's back with a microphone in her hand talking about roadway problems and rail delays.  Right.  What a waste.  All right.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:14:30]  Hopefully you'll get your wow stickers.  Contact the radio station you're listening to us on and see if they got wow stickers.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  We're just warming up.  We got lots to do today.  We only did half the stuff we wanted to yesterday.  But I don't know.  We still got to do the Miss Universe audio.  We got into this yesterday.  It's very, very good.  Yeah, where they ruined it.  We got some audio of Anthony doing some crap on the walkover yesterday.  That was really, really funny.  We got the Colbert Report that you were talking about. 
[00:15:00]  Rapport.  Rapport, I know.  He calls it rapport.  I say report.  Because it's Colbert.  Actually, you got a good observation.  We got the audio for that.  Coke Logic took Jimmy on drums yesterday and added some bass and horns to Jimmy playing the drums.  It's kind of funny.  I want to hear that.  You want to hear it real fast?  The same guy that emailed me complaining that he doesn't like the way I talk about Eddie Vedder.  Where I trash Eddie Vedder all the time.  Really?  Ooh.  Kick his ass, Jimmy.  Come on.  Stop. 
[00:15:30]  Eddie Vedder stinks.  I kind of like Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam.  They're becoming like a jam band.  They're becoming like...  Great.  They're doing kind of like the Grateful Dead thing where people are just kind of following them.  Beautiful.  And going to many, many, many, many, many shows.  Just yell out even flow at every show.  Well, then why are you there?  Why'd you show up?  Why'd you accept the award and then trash it?  Either accept... 
[00:16:00]  Wait, what was that ad again?  Some Grammys or something like that.  He accepted some award and then was like too hip for the room.  It's like, hey, stupid.  Then don't show up.  You know, how about that?  If you don't like it, don't go.  Well, they all can't be as cool as Ozzy.  At least Ozzy showed up and was honest about wanting to be there.  I know.  Ozzy's the greatest.  Ozzy's just great.  I give up.  He's all-knowing and...  All-knowing.  And after Sabbath...  Is Ozzy a wizard?  And after Sabbath, no one should have even attempted to do music.  No, after Sabbath, nobody should have attempted to be real.  It's like, if you're going to be... 
[00:16:30]  Just be who you are.  You want to go to the award show, go to the award show.  If you don't, don't go.  But there's no reason to show up and then pretend you're too hip for it.  That's what he did and that's what annoys me about him.  Yeah, you know, maybe when you're in your youth...  But he still sings a good tune.  Good for him.  Maybe when you're in your youth, just starting out in music,  you can be like the too-cool-for-the-room guy  because everyone knows you're an ass.  But then, you know, he's been around for a few years.  The too-cool-for-the-room thing, I don't think it washes anymore,  to tell you the truth, with Eddie.  I think he's reached the level where it's like, 
[00:17:00]  all right, just play your music and shut up.  Well, that's what he's been doing.  He showed up at one award show in ten years.  Enough of your drivel.  The guy has kind of, he's gone underground with his band and his fans  and they just been, they never stopped touring.  And now they got this massive following that is following them  like the Grateful Dead now.  The guy has been way under the radar for many, many years,  but never went away.  Does he play the hits still?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Absolutely.  That'll end.  And they allow their fans to just, you know, 
[00:17:30]  tape their music and all that stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're very, very user-friendly.  Didn't turn out like Neil Young won't play his music anymore?  No, no, no, no.  Bruce Springsteen playing gospel?  No, no.  That's a nice move.  Hey, you want to go see Bruce?  Yeah.  Amazing Grace.  Shut up.  What's he singing?  He's singing gospel songs.  Do you think, and how self-serving is that?  That Bruce Springsteen, anybody that likes Bruce, 
[00:18:00]  wants to go and hear,  Bone in the U.S.A.  Bone, wah, wah, wah.  Well, a little known.  And they get, like, gospel music out of him.  A little known fact, I'm a huge Neil Young fan.  Yeah.  I used to be a huge Neil Young fan.  Yeah, all right.  Prime example.  A few years back,  actually this is probably going back five or six years now,  my brother Elmo.  Brother Elmo and I went to see Neil Young.  Expecting what?  At the Bell Forum.  All the hits.  Of course, of course, he's got plenty of them. 
[00:18:30]  He's up there,  one song after another of,  and I know his catalog for the most part.  I go pretty deep with the Neil Young catalog, okay?  He was playing song after song after song.  I didn't even recognize.  I couldn't even say,  well, that's Laughing Lady,  like some maybe obscure Neil Young song  that you would just know  because you'd listen to the albums long enough.  You would listen all the way to the 10th track  so you know that 10th track on this dumb album.  Right. 
[00:19:00]  Song after song,  unfamiliar, unfamiliar.  The place, you know,  when he first came out just went nuts.  Like, oh, my God,  Neil Young fell for him.  You're a little closer.  Here comes Neil Young.  It's not like Madison Square Garden in the round  and you're in the back row.  Here it comes, Cinnamon Girl.  Exactly.  So, you know,  the first,  Eddie Vedder sucks.  It's opinions.  I don't give a crap  if you don't agree with me.  If you agree with Jimmy,  that's fine.  If you agree with me,  that's fine.  Yeah, it's very subjective.  I'm not trying to turn people.  I'm just telling you  what I think of Eddie Vedder  at Pearl Jam. 
[00:19:30]  So, the first song,  Grunge is Dead.  Oh, holy crap.  Is it?  These guys.  Grunge is dead.  Yeah.  Start looking in the stores.  The flannel's coming back.  Go to Urban Outfitters.  Look what they're displaying  for the fall.  Flannels are back.  Are you telling us  what fashion is coming up  for the fall line?  I just,  actually,  that was just an observation  yesterday.  I was walking around  and I saw flannels  in the window  of Urban Outfitters. 
[00:20:00]  I'm like,  are you kidding me?  Flannels are coming back?  And anyway,  Neil Young is the  grandfather of grunge,  right?  Or the fat.  All right,  whatever.  So, the first song,  unfamiliar,  but the crowd's still into,  like,  giving him a polite,  you know,  a polite applause.  I was like,  it's Neil Young.  Oh, you know,  Helpless is right around  the corner.  Yeah, sure.  And then he played,  like,  three or four off the album  that he was promoting  at the time,  I don't remember,  in a row,  all unfamiliar,  very polite applause.  You know when your artist,  you know,  starts into something 
[00:20:30]  and the audience is familiar,  they go nuts.  Go crazy.  There was none of that  because even though,  even Neil Young fans  that are more hardcore than me  were like,  what is this?  This selfish,  self-serving douchebag.  And this guy behind me,  this guy behind me  says it all  because he's like,  it's obvious he works  like three jobs.  He was getting all his money  together to go see Neil Young.  Probably had to take off  from work.  This was a really big deal  for him.  For me,  I was,  you know,  because of the business we're 
[00:21:00]  and I got tickets.  All right,  let's go,  you know.  And he was just so excited  and he starts whispering  under his breath like,  he's getting all pissed off,  right?  Of course he is.  Well,  he should.  And he's getting more  and more fidgety  as Neil Young is not playing  anything.  Every non-song  that goes by.  That my brother and I  or this guy knows.  Yeah.  Song after song  and as we're going deeper  into the concert,  he's just losing his mind.  Finally, 
[00:21:30]  it's really quiet  and Neil Young's playing  a real soft acoustic,  you know,  garbage song  that no one knew.  He stands up  and I swear to you,  he goes,  hey,  Neil,  how about one for us?  Bravo.  It said it all.  Bravo for that jerk.  And the freaking place  just goes nuts  because they were all feeling it.  Of course.  They were all feeling it.  Except Neil.  Except for maybe  a hundred out of the few thousand  that were in this particular show. 
[00:22:00]  They think everyone wants to,  they're such geniuses  that everyone wants to hear  anything they do.  And he's tired of playing  the old songs.  Oh,  look,  man,  I'm just tired.  How many times have I played them?  It's what your audience paid to see.  It's what they want to see.  Give it to them.  If it's work now,  sorry.  If going out there  and playing the hits  isn't fun for you  or exciting,  then don't tour anymore  because you're disappointing  your listeners.  Or say you won't be playing them. 
[00:22:30]  Say I'm doing a gig.  Absolutely.  Make it clear  when you're selling the tickets.  Put it on the ticket.  Right.  I am not doing  all the songs you want to hear.  You can get a refund right now.  Well,  Neil Young's been known  to do this.  You know,  he blows off  a lot of his old catalog  when he puts out  a new album.  But you're 100% right.  It wasn't like  they dropped the ticket price  knowing that Neil Young  wasn't going to play any hits.  You know,  if Neil Young wants to do that,  hey,  have a ticket for $10.  Right. 
[00:23:00]  And say the reason it's $10  is because I'm going to  experiment and play  a lot of stuff  you're not going to be  familiar with.  But as an artist,  when you're,  I mean,  these concert tickets,  the prices are ridiculous.  Everyone wants to hear the hits.  You want to hear the hits.  And as an artist,  you know,  you have an obligation.  You got to play  a lot of the stuff  that the fans want to hear.  You just got to make a decision.  I can understand  getting bored  with the same crap  all the time.  Like,  all right,  I've done that.  But it's like,  then let people know  they're not going to hear it  because people aren't paying  a lot of money.  I wouldn't want to see  that dumb Neil Young 
[00:23:30]  unless he played  Heart of Gold  or something I knew.  Yeah.  Something you know.  Something you've heard before.  Just dumb ramblings.  There are so many people  that do that,  though.  I'm tired of it,  man.  Tired of playing this.  I'm going to just  kowtow to the man.  Yeah.  Say it so no one shows up  and you play to nobody.  All right,  we went off on a tangent there.  But basically,  we'll save the Jimmy thing then.  That's where we were leading.  But we've got to take a break.  We'll do it right after the break.  Coke Logic added horns  and bass to Jimmy's drumming. 
[00:24:00]  It's pretty funny, actually.  Gotta hear this.  And we've got lots and lots  of stuff to do.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday  on the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading  across America.  Jimmy and I came up  with something years ago.  Basically, it says  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute  to unrestrained female  unabomies.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else  is talking about.  ONA uncut and live 
[00:24:30]  continuing the show  on XM Satellite Radio  starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com  to subscribe.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus  spreading across America.  Let's say hi to Pittsburgh.  Mike, what's going on today, man?  Hey, guys.  I just want to let you guys know  that you are absolutely right.  K-Rock out here, W-R-K-Z, 
[00:25:00]  is definitely distributing  the WOW stickers.  Wow.  I can barely hear the lad.  I know.  And your phone, like,  dropped out as you started talking.  You're listening on  the Pittsburgh station  and they're doing a good job  with the WOW stickers?  Heck yeah.  Heck yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  Thanks for the help today, Mike.  Yeah, they got them out  at the station there for free.  They got them out  at all the concerts  distributing huge, huge numbers.  I guess,  out at all stuff. 
[00:25:30]  So it was pretty successful  so far, I guess.  All right.  There you go, Pittsburgh.  There's Mike representing your city.  Did an awful job.  Thanks, Mike.  Thank you.  How about a little energy next time?  He's a little sleepy.  A little sleepy?  Yeah, we have to come in here  all full of energy.  He can just, yeah,  he's like,  wow, it's doing good.  Well, we're a very interactive radio show,  so when we go to the phones,  we want some excitement.  We want a little oof.  People that are awake. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, if you're not awake,  don't call the show until later, okay?  Hey, yesterday,  we had drums in here  because I guess  the New York Dolls  played on the radio chick show  here in New York City.  Apparently so, yes.  So they were setting up  ahead of time  and they had the whole  drum kit here  and some drum sticks  and Jimmy decided  to jam a little bit.  Jimmy has more  of a jazz style.  More of a free-form  jazz style of drumming,  which is reminiscent  of an infant 
[00:26:30]  picking up a stick  and banging it  on pots and pans  and just as adorable.  He knows how to go with it, though.  Of course,  he can go with the flow  and a lot of people  can't play and sing  at the same time,  mind you.  Jimmy,  the natural.  Well, Jimmy brought us back  from break yesterday  on the drums  where he was just,  you know,  hitting the skins  and singing.  All right,  1955 reference.  So Coke Logic  turned it into a jazz band. 
[00:27:00]  He added bass.  Little bass.  And post-prod.  Yeah.  And what else did he add?  Bass and...  Little horns.  He had some horns going.  And horns.  Yeah.  In post-production.  So this is what  Jimmy now sounds like  as Coke Logic  builds a band around him.  Mm-hmm.  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  We're back. 
[00:27:30]  Back in the New York room.  Welcome back  to the OBN Anthony Show.  I love the comments.  Ha, ha, ha.  And then the very next one, 
[00:28:00]  Jimmy is an ass.  Ha, ha, ha.  I would listen to that  every day for a while, though.  That's some good stuff.  It's catchy.  What's the difference  between that  and any jazz?  Yeah.  None.  It's definitely catchy.  I think we need to,  like, loop it  and make it a little longer.  Make it a little longer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hope Lodget, you're onto something there.  And the video of Jimmy playing the drums is up on opianthony.com.  All right?  Fantastic.  Hey, really fast, Kevin Smith, this Kevin Smith, Joel Siegel, Clerks 2 review thing will not die. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I saw it on that 10 show that, what is it called?  Top.  Daily 10.  Daily 10, thank you, fan.  Oh, we played the audio yesterday.  Yeah, the Daily 10 on E.  Yes.  A pop culture show that's blowing up.  Did he credit the show?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah, he did.  Had video of us in the studio, and then they had Kevin Smith, a little still picture of Kevin Smith and Joel Siegel next to each other. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  With the audio.  Apparently, the audio from the bad video that was taken in studio, instead of, as Steve put it, the pristine video, audio from the show that I had sent him.  Yeah, we finally got a big hit.  You know, a big thing on E, and they used really crappy audio from what?  It was from the camera?  It was from the camera, yeah, from the video camera, instead of the audio that Steve sent.  But I was completely distracted when Steve sent me the email telling me what happened, because he goes, they used that instead of the pristine audio that I had. 
[00:29:30]  Pristine.  Had a laugh.  Yeah, without a doubt.  So, Kevin Smith was on Craig Ferguson last night?  Oh, yeah.  And we got another mention.  Sandy, got something to add?  No.  Oh, you were just standing there?  No.  Okay.  Here's the audio.  You get involved with your critics, don't you?  You could have talked to them.  I got involved with him.  Like, I got to speak to him on the opening Anthony shows on the radio show.  Right. 
[00:30:00]  And they called him up, and we got to chat about it back and forth.  And it wasn't very heated.  I don't even think he understood it was me on the phone.  Right.  But it was strange, because, like, this is a dude I grew up watching on TV.  Like, he was the face of movie criticism when I was a kid, like, on Eyewitness News back in Jersey.  But so it's, midway through the fight, I'm sitting there going, like, it's, I feel like I'm arguing with my father.  You know, if my father looked like the gay biker from the Village People.  Right on. 
[00:30:30]  Got to get his little slam in.  That's good.  Yeah, Kevin Smith is a true fan of the show, man.  Yeah, that's awesome.  Funny, funny gentleman.  Clerks 2 did very well.  And Newsday, the review crew reviewed Clerks 2, and they gave it pretty good reviews.  Oh, they did?  Actually, I think it was an A-minus and a B-plus.  It was more than pretty good reviews.  Is it the usual review crew or a new review crew?  Ah, they move them around a little bit.  Do they?  Yeah.  They shuffle them around?  They shuffle.  Actually, they did movie reviews in general. 
[00:31:00]  So they did Clerks 2, Lady in the Water.  What did they think of that?  Lady in the Water is just a bomb.  You know, it's advertised as a horror-type movie, and supposedly it's not.  Oh, really?  That's what I read.  I don't know what to make of this stupid movie.  M. Night.  I just watched Sixth Sense recently, like two days ago.  Great movie.  And I'm amazed at what a great movie that is.  Just fantastic story and the twist and the acting in it. 
[00:31:30]  Great.  And then you get something like this piece of garbage.  After The Village, I don't know why anybody would go to see.  After The Village, why would anybody see anything he did?  He's just awful.  Like the monster-y people with the hoods, the elders.  Oh, that movie could have been really good.  Yeah, but there was suck.  No, there was suck.  The concept was really good, though.  Yeah.  His concepts are really good.  But I think the guy's done.  I think he just lucked out with Sixth Sense.  Yep.  Wanted out.  Because I think last week in the paper, they showed a chart of his success. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Starting with Sixth Sense, and it's just drastically dropping every movie he puts out.  What's his name?  Shyamalan Ding Dong.  M. Night Shyamalan.  M. Night Shyamalan.  M. Night Shyamalan.  Lady in the Water, the Review Crew, Newsday.  Lakia Brown.  What's Lakia got for us?  Hey, man.  She's Irish.  Really?  No.  Oh.  Lakia says, not too much thriller and just enough comedy. 
[00:32:30]  The timing of it was perfect.  But the mythological storyline was a little too much make-believe for me.  Was that for clerks?  No, Lady in the Water.  Sorry.  Perhaps the best part was the profound underlying message that each of us can influence the lives of others.  Ew.  I must have made it cause me to shed a few tears in the theater.  Tears?  Why?  Did you look at your ticket price and realize you paid for that crap?  Really?  I can help others?  Hey!  And then, see, it doesn't sound like a thriller or a horror movie, but it's completely advertised that way. 
[00:33:00]  You know what I realized when I watched The Village?  That if you wear red with a green background, you'll look handsome.  Stupid.  Then you got Evan.  It's difficult to deny that Shyamalan's talent for undercovering the supernatural and fantastic hidden just beneath the surface of the ordinary.  And he demonstrates it as definitely here.  It's unclear to me whether that vision was improved by the film's tongue-in-cheek self-awareness. 
[00:33:30]  Whatever the case, I recommend you see it and decide for yourself.  So, basically, that review.  That review stunk.  See it and decide for yourself.  I like that, out of a reviewer.  Yeah, I don't know what to make of it.  You see it.  I got no opinion on it.  I probably won't see it.  I'll wait.  Somebody will burn it for me for free, and I'll watch it at my house.  I went and saw another cartoon over the weekend.  Would you say Cars?  I haven't seen Cars yet, and I hear that's really good. 
[00:34:00]  I went and saw Monster House.  You saw Monster House?  Yeah, because it was another 3-D movie.  Oh, you're digging these 3-D movies, man.  Yeah.  And they do it really well with the cartoons.  No, I'm not digging the 3-D movies when it's like Superman.  Yeah.  I mean, everyone's ranting and raving about the 3-D stuff in Superman.  It stinks.  They still have a little ways to go when it comes to like a non-cartoon movie.  Live action.  And besides the fact they just handed out the 3-D glasses to you, 
[00:34:30]  and you're wondering who wore them.  You're kind of right about that, Anthony, okay?  It's a little creepy.  And you see the grease marks on the glasses.  Grease marks on the glasses.  Chew marks that goes behind your ears.  Yeah.  People like sit there and chew on them before the –  What if someone like Rich Voss, who has that behind-the-ear cyst,  was wearing those glasses, and it burst.  And that pussy mess that comes out and smells like a dumpster got on the glasses. 
[00:35:00]  And then you put that in your mouth and start sucking on it.  Think of the deliciousness.  Who needs the snack bar?  Right.  Well, Monster House, they gave you the glasses in a nice, you know, bag that was sealed or whatever.  And when it comes to 3-D movies, the cartoons, it's right there.  Yeah, they got that down.  It's so worth going to the movie to check out a 3-D movie if it's a cartoon.  Everyone reaching in front of them.  Oh, yeah.  Grab the –  Sometimes the stuff –  Yeah, it's coming right at you.  It's coming right at you.  I like pulling women's hair in the seat in front of me and go, 
[00:35:30]  I could almost feel it as I'm slamming her head against the back of her seat.  Sorry, the 3-D got me confused.  But Monster House is definitely worth checking out and getting really good reviews.  How could cartoons get?  But, well, I guess I've seen some bad ones.  They had a preview for –  For the most part, they're pretty good.  They had a preview for Nightmare Before Christmas.  New one?  No.  The old one they're releasing again right around Halloween in 3-D. 
[00:36:00]  How are they going to do that?  And the preview looked really cool.  It wasn't made in 3-D, was it?  No.  How did they do that?  They took the original – I don't know how they did it.  Like magic.  Yeah, but they redid it in 3-D, and it's coming out in October.  And the review – I mean, the preview looked great.  So, Colbert, Anthony.  Yes.  It's one of my new favorite shows.  The Colbert Report.  It's on Comedy Central right after The Daily Show.  And in my opinion, I think it blows away The Daily Show. 
[00:36:30]  The Daily Show is getting a little predictable.  It's been on for a while.  It's the same kind of thing.  I think John's taking himself a little seriously.  I was going to say that.  That's the problem.  I've seen –  He should just move on to, like, MSNBC or –  Just real news.  Or Fox News.  Well, I mean, you got –  With a little humorous twist.  Yeah, you got Keith Oberman that is balancing it out nicely.  He gives you the news.  Who, by the way, was in a little bit of trouble with Fox News.  Well, he's going after O'Reilly. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, he put an O'Reilly mask on and gave the Sig Heil some event.  He gave the Nazi salute.  So he caught a little bit of crap.  I love Keith Oberman.  We've been trying to get him on the show, but so far he's not biting.  But I love what he does on MSNBC.  It's much more entertaining than watching O'Reilly.  Yeah.  And Jon Stewart, though, when he has guests on now, especially political guests, it gets very serious.  There's not really any joking going on. 
[00:37:30]  And, you know, and I don't know.  It was kind of funnier when he would just have goofy celebrity guests on and goof around with them.  I think he's taking himself a little seriously.  And the whole gag, you know, the reporters being on location and talking about things.  I mean, it's still funny, but it's kind of getting old.  Colbert, though, it's a perfect parody of O'Reilly and all these other real far right-wing talk shows that are under the guise of news. 
[00:38:00]  And he pulls it off perfectly.  He does this thing where he says he doesn't see race.  And he asks people if they're black.  He goes, you're black.  I assume you're black because you're telling me.  He goes, I don't see color.  I don't see color.  Derek, it's such a funny gag.  It's like talking to the head of the NAACP about black people.  And he's like, I'll assume you're black because you're telling me because I just don't see color. 
[00:38:30]  He's so far above it.  He goes, I'm above that.  And it's all about him.  When he has a guest, he had Tom Brokaw on last night.  And when he has a guest, normally the camera pans to the guest as they walk out.  And the crowd gives applause to the guest and they sit down.  Stephen Colbert is sitting at his desk.  The guest is already seated somewhere on another part of the stage.  He introduces the guest, gets up, starts applauding himself.  And the camera does nothing but follow Colbert over to the seat because he's the center of attention. 
[00:39:00]  It's a great parody of the self-important right-wing talk show host.  There's not many shows out there that are clever.  That show is definitely very clever.  And he does these things.  Very unique.  He recognizes certain congressional districts in this country and counts them down.  There's hundreds of them.  You get this little speck on the map and he'll put the little thing on the map like he's just talked about that congressional district. 
[00:39:30]  And he'll talk to the representatives and stuff.  And it was Robert Wexler he spoke with.  Had a good interview with him.  It was very funny.  And then it turns out he's running for re-election unopposed.  He's unchallenged.  So you can't lose.  So Stephen Colbert kind of challenged him to say something that if he was opposed would absolutely lose him the election. 
[00:40:00]  Would just blow the election.  Yeah.  But since you're unopposed, you got no – it's not a problem.  Right.  Because there's no one to vote against.  So just blow it.  And he got him to do it.  It's very funny.  And I think we have the audio.  Let's have some fun.  Let's say a few things that would really lose the election for you if you were contested.  But remember, you're not contested.  There's no way you can lose.  Right.  I enjoy cocaine because – 
[00:40:30]  This would lose me the election?  Yeah.  The thing you say would lose you the election if you said it.  But you're not going to because you're uncontested.  There's no way you can lose.  Right.  I enjoy cocaine because –  You try without laughing because then people will think it's a joke.  Oh.  Because it's a fun thing to do.  Yes, we are from the beginning.  Because you laugh every day.  Oh.  Yes.  It's a fun thing to do.  I enjoy cocaine because it's a fun thing to do. 
[00:41:00]  I enjoy cocaine because it's a fun thing to do.  I enjoy the company of prostitutes for the following reasons.  I enjoy the company of prostitutes for the following reasons.  Oh.  Because it's a fun thing to do.  Okay.  Looks like I can.  My five cocaine, if you combine the two together, it's probably even more fun.  Wow.  You realize there is no amount of damage control you can do at this point. 
[00:41:30]  We better finish this interview quick because I'm not sure how long you're going to be in Congress.  God.  That is such a great bit.  Yeah.  On Monday, I guess Wexler told the Associated Press he was fully aware of what was happening in the interview and has no regrets.  Asked what his teenage children thought of his performance.  He said they thought I was foolish.  And some people were giving him a little bit of grief about this.  Of course they were.  Because they're all sticks in the mud.  I thought it was really funny and showed the guy, like, as a human being, having a little bit of fun. 
[00:42:00]  You can't – why would anyone have to explain away why you did that?  It's obviously a funny thing.  Because it's just the whole uptight attitude everybody has in Washington.  You're not allowed to have that type of fun.  Do you know how many people – their lives are destroyed by cocaine and prostitution?  And you're joking about it.  That's the kind of crap this guy was getting.  But we – it's almost like their criticism isn't even sincere. 
[00:42:30]  Like, they know what he was doing.  Right.  It's so obviously a joke.  It's such – it's disingenuous.  People just like to be heard, man.  They just want people to, like, go, hey, you're – I can't listen.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  You know, you're right, and then have to get in the paper and apologize, which I'm glad he didn't do.  Good for him.  You know?  He seemed like a young guy, but he said that a lot of his interns and people had told him about Colbert.  He never saw the show, he said.  And that's why he agreed to do it.  And see, even so, he was still kind of almost backpedaling a little bit when he realized what he said and watched it. 
[00:43:00]  Because I guess they taped 90 minutes of the interview, and what you get is two or three minutes that they splice together and make you look really silly.  It's something they do very well on that show.  Just a great bit.  We have to take a break.  We've got to catch up a little bit.  We got – we started down this road yesterday.  We got the Miss Universe banter.  They had Carson, the gay guy from Queer Eye, whatever.  Queer Eye for the straight guy.  And a chick as the commentators for Miss Universe. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, why rune – I mean, why not rune Miss Universe?  Let's throw a gay guy in there to do the commentary instead of just have hot chicks to look at.  Well, on the way, we got a hungry joke, a wedgie commentary.  What's he hungry for?  Nonsensical innuendos.  Gay guy makes a share joke.  It's all on the way.  Yes, he does.  Also, Tom Brokhoff, we don't do this today, talking about global warming and the effects.  Global warming.  And he tries to say carbon dioxide two, four, six, seven times. 
[00:44:00]  Seven times we got that.  He was on Colbert last night, and he actually said, falafel.  You can find me at a falafel stand.  Falafel.  The guy has problems with else.  Oh, and saying falafel was really funny to watch.  Well, what was he saying?  He pretty much has a lot of time now that he's not on network news.  Like not on the news anymore.  So you could – what?  You could see him hanging out at a falafel stand?  Yeah, Stephen Colbert asked, what is he doing with himself?  You could find me at a falafel stand in this town. 
[00:44:30]  A falafel.  And also on the way, another which way is north story.  We'll get into all this in just a bit.  It's the One virus spreading across America.  Whip them out Wednesday is a wonderful pastime embraced by Opie and Anthony fans all over the globe.  Some people, however, fail to see the joy in this time-honored tradition.  In the spirit of fairness, we offer them this platform to voice their opinions to the Opie and Anthony show.  Introducing, irate keyboarding person. 
[00:45:00]  Dear Opie and Anthony, why do you guys always have to talk about Whip them out Wednesday?  I don't want to see strange b****s.  The only b****s I want to see are the ones on my lovely bride, Eunice.  Or the ones on my back.  I really need to see a doctor, I think they're saying.  If the fault of seeing naked b****s upsets you this much, we submit to you that there may be a larger issue you're not dealing with.

[00:46:00]  Really fast before we get into the Miss Universe commentary that we started yesterday.  Another story of which way is north.  Which way is north.  We love these stories.  We broadcast from New York City.  Everyone knows that.  Gotta be streetwise.  Well, a lot of people out there listening to us right now, they're going to come to Manhattan eventually.  Yep.  When we do the walkover to XM every day, we see listeners from all over the country that happen to be in New York and they stop by to say hi. 
[00:46:30]  We gotta make sure they understand.  When someone comes up to you and asks for directions, asks for a cigarette, asks you what time it is.  Yep, what time it is is a biggie because you look down at your watch.  Take Anthony's advice, act crazy and run away.  Run away.  Don't even give them enough time to do anything.  Run away from them.  Run into the middle of the street because some poor bastard's just minding his own beeswax in Central Park. 
[00:47:00]  And a guy comes up to him and what does he do?  He asks him for a cigarette.  A 63-year-old man was beaten and robbed at knife point during a daylight holdup in Central Park yesterday.  Uh, the hoodlum slugged the unidentified victim in the ramble about 3 p.m. after asking to bomb a cigarette.  See?  Just go, hey, uh, got a cigarette? 
[00:47:30]  It's rarely ever somebody just comes running at you windmilling with their fists, you know?  Yeah.  Because then you have time to get away.  Ah!  Oh my God!  You run away.  That's such a good point.  It's just, well, this guy's windmilling at me.  I gotta get out of the line of fire here.  See, call is crazy, but the muggers, they have a strategy.  There's a plan.  Yeah.  They got a game plan.  They always have a plan.  And their game plan isn't screaming as they're running toward you.  With arms just flailing. 
[00:48:00]  You know, that's a bad cover.  This sounds really stupid, but I never thought of it that way.  You're right.  They gotta sneak up on you somehow, and the only way to do that is by asking you a distracting question.  Right, right.  And believe me, they are armed for bear, ready to just cock back their fist and whammo right  in the face.  And that seems to be what happened to this guy.  Yeah, as the victim cowered on the ground, the suspect allegedly pulled a knife and threatened  to kill him.  Great.  Wonderful.  The mugger then swiped the man's bracelet and chain before fleeing, a police source said. 
[00:48:30]  Give him the cigarette?  Blah, blah, blah.  You know, then they have eyewitnesses talking about how, I don't know, whatever, that this  is going on in the daylight.  You know how surprised people are when that happens to them?  You can't possibly know how surprising it is.  Just have someone go, excuse me, what time is it?  And you go to look at your watch, you're like, um, whammo.  Just that whole, bing, you hear in your head. 
[00:49:00]  And what the hell just happened?  What the, what, what, what, what, what, what the, who the, who the, who the, who the, it's  all, you don't want to be like blindsided like that.  And that's how they operate.  They blindside you.  Which way is north is, uh, our favorite, you know, which way is north and they'll get  you in a certain situation, but they know which way north is because they want you to  turn north so they can punch you in the side of the face.  Yeah, because they will be standing either on the east or west side of you, even south 
[00:49:30]  there, south, they could come with a roundhouse and, and, and get the side of your head.  They know which way north is.  They just need you to turn your head toward north.  It's the way they need your head to point, to punch you in your face.  Savages.  Or the cigarette, because now you're, you're looking down.  Anything you're looking down.  Right.  Take one out of your pack, you know.  Yeah.  And next thing you know, blammo, and you wake up in a hospital bed and there's a little Christmas 
[00:50:00]  tree at your bedside.  Christmas tree.  And you remember it was just hot.  We were in a heat wave.  And, uh, it's, it's, uh, it's 4.30 in the afternoon, yet it's pitch black out.  And it's snowing.  And there are cards from loved ones.  Merry Christmas.  Get well soon.  Things like that.  That's how it happens.  In a second.  You think they go with the, for the, uh, uh, your shoe is untied?  Hey, your shoe's untied.  Oh, who's falling for that?  And you look down and get an uppercut right to your nose. 
[00:50:30]  No, it's, it's asking for directions, asking for the cigarette and asking for what time  it is.  Asking for things that you would normally get.  Yeah.  Things that people wouldn't, uh, uh, have a problem parting with.  Right.  Giving the time, a cigarette, something like that.  So, and then directions, yeah.  So, there you go.  The latest, uh, which way is north story from the paper today.  Got the old guy pummeled and, uh, almost stabbed and robbed. 
[00:51:00]  Let's go to Kyle in Grand Rapids.  A lot of phone calls coming in from Grand Rapids already.  Hey, Grand Rapids.  What's up, Kyle?  Yeah, we're loving you down here, or, well, up here, I guess.  Over, up.  How long have we, we've been on?  Like two days, three days, maybe?  Yeah, but I've been listening to you guys on XM for about two years, so it's really cool  to have you guys on the air down here, so.  Cool, man.  Yeah, when I'm going back to school, everyone's going to know my, my jokes that I steal from  you guys.  Boring. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  All right, let's go, Kyle.  We're going to steal our jokes.  That's cool.  Oh, yeah.  He just showed you.  Yeah, I found, I, I gave a black guy a cigarette when I was in Harlem, and nothing happened.  Really?  Yeah, but I did threaten to be killed.  This, this Negro comes up, and he's like, yeah, you uptown bitches, get out of here.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, what, what time was it?  Oh, it was, uh, probably about three o'clock, maybe. 
[00:52:00]  In the afternoon?  You know, we have a very important job here.  We've got to categorize our, uh, our callers, and I'm going to categorize you, Kyle, as a,  uh, as a listener.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, I love you guys.  A listener that should not participate.  There's listeners.  Poor guy.  Then there's listeners that should participate.  First call into, uh, the show?  Uh, uh, no, I've called in before.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Bob before, too.  Wow.  No, this isn't the first bomb. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, I love you guys.  Shut the hell up.  I'm a huge supporter.  All right, Kyle.  Thank you.  Hey, KLQ, we need a sticker stop.  All right.  Yeah, spread the virus there in, uh, Grand Rapids for us, will ya?  He's not taking your crap, Opie.  I know.  It's all right.  I respect that.  All right, Kyle.  Thanks.  Let's get into the Miss Universe thing.  Ooh.  So, the setup, uh, we talked to Donald Trump.  Donald Trump's running this.  He used to run Miss America.  Uh, I think that got a little too, um, uh, politically correct, a little safe.  Donald got bored with it. 
[00:53:00]  Uh, the ratings dropped.  And, uh, he got rid of it.  Now he's got Miss Universe, which, uh, is just about chicks.  Just about hot chicks.  No talent.  None of that crap.  If you, who cares, who cares if she could juggle or sing a song or play a violin, get  her out in that, uh, bikini, bikini, a little thong, get, uh, some lingerie on the girl, parade  her out there.  I don't care if she's as dumb as a doorknob, just as long as she looks nice. 
[00:53:30]  And, uh, that's what this show's all about.  So, how could you possibly wreck it?  How, yeah, exactly.  How could you, how could you ruin that?  How could you ruin a show where they're just going to parade 80 of the hottest chicks  in the universe?  The whole universe.  That includes Rigel 7.  I believe that's a planet where Captain Kirk got some green bra.  Some of these bra's were on spaceships for many, many years.  Oh.  Just to get here. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  Cryogenically frozen so they could get here in pristine condition.  And, uh, yeah.  Some had to hitch a ride on a space shuttle.  Because it's the universe for the last few thousand miles.  How pompous we are as a planet.  I know.  And, uh, how do you screw it up?  By putting announcers in there that do not fit.  Well, uh, the lady, she, I guess she won the title last year or something.  That means she could talk.  And she wants to go, uh, into journalism and broadcasting. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  So, there you go.  Give her a shot.  And then, uh, Carson.  Carson, the gay guy from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.  Because, uh, you want to, you, when you're a guy looking at hot girls on a show that is  nothing but hot girls parading around, you want a gay guy's voice commenting constantly.  Yeah, you want to be distracted by a gay guy.  To take the hotness away.  Right.  You just want to be reminded that there's a gay guy there.  Right.  Commenting.  They didn't want anybody who was going to want to sleep with the girls commenting on 
[00:55:00]  it.  Yeah.  They wanted it to be totally safe.  Safe, right.  Nobody lusting the girls talking into a microphone.  Yeah, but, but here's the problem.  Have Jimmy Norton on there.  All you'd hear is like, like the Jimmy grunts that he does when a hot girl walks in the studio.  Like, here's the problem though.  Carson is lusting sort of after these girls in, in that cute gay way.  Faking it.  Exactly.  Ribble.  It's just, it's just another way to emasculate the proceedings. 
[00:55:30]  Go to online and just grab pornography off the computer.  Why would you watch a bunch of people parading in their underpants when you could just get  a hard core sense?  Underpants.  I don't get it.  Why you'd want that?  Unless there's some kind of funny commentary.  I think people like soft, soft core sometimes.  Big fan of soft.  They do.  Soft core.  Like those pageants can be good.  You sit there and you know, that one's hot.  Oh wow, this one's coming out good.  This one here, ooh, the ass is a little wide.  Maybe she should have, you know, worked that off. 
[00:56:00]  It's kind of fun.  You want to leave a little to the imagination.  No.  I'd rather have.  I like leaving a little to the imagination.  I think it should be totally nude at the end of the pageant.  Well, that would be.  That would be.  That would be ideal.  That would be a great pageant.  But who wouldn't watch it right up to the end when they all come out just naked?  Oh.  All right.  Well.  Never do that.  Every time a girl walks out, that stupid gay guy, she just goes, ugh, where is it?  Where is it?  Nobody wants that.  Enough with the over-the-top gay guy. 
[00:56:30]  We get it.  They should just get, like, three regular guys.  Of course.  Yeah.  Regular guys.  Just sit around.  With city jobs.  Three slobs on a couch.  Yeah.  Con ed workers, we said yesterday.  Hey, look at this one coming out, huh?  Construction workers.  Nice set.  Yeah.  No filters whatsoever.  Just let them talk.  But no one has balls anymore, as far as TV goes, except for the Steve Colbert that we were  just discussing. 
[00:57:00]  Like that.  But that's very rare.  The soup.  Everything else is so cookie-cutter.  Our buddy Joel McHale on the soup.  Yeah.  He's pretty good, too.  All right.  So here we go.  Here's the blonde bimbo, who has nothing to add, and gay guy Carson commenting on the  girls as they're on the stage.  Wonderful.  Yeah, I think we love Miss Beedon.  Are you from Sweden?  As we stay in her homeland, your Elsker Airspadia.  That means we love you, Sweden. 
[00:57:30]  She's cute.  She has a really sweet look to her.  She's innocent.  But is she?  How would he know?  Who's laughing at that?  No one.  Who's home cracking up?  Ha ha!  Is she?  I don't know.  What do you think, Frank?  Give me a beer.  Who's laughing at that crap?  Nobody.  No one is laughing at that.  It's horrid.  But someone behind the scenes has to say, yeah, let's do this.  Yeah, this is a great idea.  We'll get Carson and the blonde bimbo.  Donald. 
[00:58:00]  I think Donald.  Donald doesn't even know when the show is on.  Do you think he doesn't even have any say?  I didn't know when the show was on.  You don't think in some meeting they said, Donald, hosting the show is going to be the gay guy  from Queer Eye and the chick that won, like, last year?  He may know about that, but he's out of touch because he doesn't, Donald doesn't understand  the way real guys talk about women.  No.  What does he know?  He's Trump.  He doesn't have that interaction ever.  He walks into a room.  All right.  You, you know, thank you.  And you.  Yeah.  That's what his life is.  You'll be my wife for the next few years. 
[00:58:30]  You'll give me a kid.  You'll ruin your body.  See ya.  I'll pay you off real well, and then I'll get another broad.  So here's my list.  Then I'll get a new car.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the rest of this one.  Brazil.  And the crowd goes wild.  They love Brazil here.  A minor.  I think she almost had a wedgie situation.  Was that a wedgie situation? 
[00:59:00]  Oh.  Tasting good.  She did it very tastefully.  That's funny.  Almost.  That is good.  Wedgie.  That's good.  Wedgie.  Boy, construction workers must have just been hitting their Pabst Blue Ribbon beers together.  T-Bow.  Rewind the T-Bow a little bit.  This faggot's hysterical.  Did he say what I think he did?  A wedgie.  Oh.  Thank God the kids are in bed.  Just more innocent drivel.  Let's go to Kevin in New York.  Kevin. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Kevin.  Hey, sir.  You want to talk, or should we just kind of read your mind?  You're on the air.  Speak.  I couldn't hear you guys.  Sorry.  Listeners, 0 for 3 today.  0 for 3.  No, I just want to talk to you guys about the Con Ed workers.  They're not so bad.  No, huh?  Did I say the Con Ed workers are bad?  No, you said they should sit around.  I said they should sit around and watch the show, you ass.  I'm not talking about your actual job.  I said get some Con Ed workers to sit around and watch this. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  As the commentators.  Except in Queens, where because they're not doing their jobs, you can't get any TV.  Yeah.  They're thrust back into the 1800s.  People have been without power since 78.  Can you fix it?  By the way, no one's going to give a crap, but over the weekend.  Thanks, Kevin.  Now we're going to go off on a little tangent here.  Here in New York, an area in Queens, no power for what, 8, 9, 10 days?  8, 10 days now. 
[01:00:30]  Something like that, okay?  It's a really big story here in New York, and the system is failing and blah, blah, blah.  They got everyone back up and running pretty much, I think, right at this point?  Kind of temporary.  There's big electrical lines running down the street.  They have to get those underground, and when they do that, they have to shut people's power off.  Oh, this is great.  And something blew up this morning, some manhole covers flew up in the air, and more power went out.  Well, the point I want to make, it's a huge story. 
[01:01:00]  A lot of people were affected in that area, okay?  And no one's going to give a crap, but I have an observation.  I was watching the British Open.  I like watching golf, and Tiger Woods winning the British Open was just a great sports moment this past weekend.  So I'm watching it, and all of a sudden, they do a special report with the mayor and the Con Ed people talking about where they're at with this power outage in Queens.  Oh, I see where you're going here.  And I'm sitting there going, the people that care about this special report do not have power! 
[01:01:30]  They can't see it.  Put the British Open back on TV!  And the people that have power don't care that there's people without power.  Yeah, that's the reality of it.  I don't care.  If you're not affected, you don't give a crap, unless you have, like, an old aunt or grandma that lives in that area.  You don't care.  Yeah.  So I'm sitting there like, why are they breaking into the British Open to do a special report for people that can't watch TV?  Especially golf.  You don't have anybody who empathizes with people in Queens watching golf. 
[01:02:00]  Well, that's the point.  I know no one's going to care because I was watching golf, but, I mean, you'll understand what I'm saying, though, how stupid this is.  I haven't given it a second thought that they have no power.  I'm sorry.  I can't be bothered.  So stupid.  I'm sitting there like, you've got to be kidding.  And it was really heating up and getting interesting at the British Open.  And they pop into a special report.  A putt for birdie and for the win. 
[01:02:30]  That's more than that.  But no one's going to give a crap.  All right, here we go.  More commentary from Carson and the blonde bimbo from Miss Universe over the weekend.  Grinidad and Tobago.  Now, I personally think she has the best face of the pageant.  Oh, and how about her Trinidads and Tobagos?  Not that either.  Trinidads and Tobagos are nicely packaged, yes.  But the face of the pageant, I think.  What does that mean? 
[01:03:00]  Her boobies.  Oh, excuse me.  Oh.  Let me titter.  I caught the innuendo.  Tee-hee-hee-hee.  He's a naughty one.  Tee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  Hey.  Stupid Moe, shut it.  Moe.  Isn't this really annoying, though?  Revolting.  Good natured.  Joshin' around.  I imagine the Miss Universe pageant is seen by many millions of people.  And someone had to sign off on this and say this is going to be some great TV. 
[01:03:30]  And believe me.  I'm just thinking that they're just lazy behind the scenes at this point.  They're just lazy.  Any mound in a girl's shirt is not what this guy's looking at.  What do they call them?  Trinidads and Tobago?  What does that mean?  It's the country she's from.  So he put it in a way where it sounded like he was talking about her breasts.  How funny is that?  I can't get over that the guy did that.  It had that air.  I'm surprised the FCC's not all over the edgy talk that those two had. 
[01:04:00]  Whoa.  Oof.  Oof.  Oof.  Oof.  All right.  Moving on.  A lawyer note.  Trinidad and Tobago no longer allowed to be said on these airwaves since people now  will equate them with bosoms.  CBS Law Firm.  CBS Law Firm taking the fun out of radio.  Well, here's the share joke we all are looking forward to.  Of course.  Bolivia.  Now, Bolivia, to me, resembles a lot of Miss Universe 2003 Amelia Vega, who's actually 
[01:04:30]  one of the judges.  I wonder if that'll work in her favor.  I love her because she looks like Cher.  And we know you queers love Cher.  You sure do.  She's from Bolivia.  How about that's the hottest heroin mule I've ever looked at?  Why wouldn't you do a joke like that?  You'd just see a trail of little baggies with white powder falling out as she's walking.  Exactly.  Hope she doesn't sneeze where the back of her bathing suit is going to be filled with coke. 
[01:05:00]  No, don't go that angle.  Oh, so it's my share.  No, we should have done.  We should have watched the exact same footage that they're commenting on and had our own  comments.  Do our own commentary.  Next time.  Next time.  Lazy.  Lazy bastards we are.  You hear the fake laugh by the blonde bimbo.  I recognize the name Cher.  I know.  And we know you gay guys just love Cher. 
[01:05:30]  How about a joke about hungry?  Ooh.  Hungry.  That person, what do you think of this one?  I think that probably all the girls are feeling a little hungry.  I mean, what have they been eating the last two weeks?  Like Tic Tacs and ice cubes?  What?  Ice cubes, honey.  We eat ice cubes.  Are you serious?  No.  No wonder they're a little listless.  Um.  I get it. 
[01:06:00]  I just like the way he's stressed toward hungry.  It looks like they're all a little hungry.  Oh.  All right.  I wasn't sure you were going with that.  I'm hungry for some c**t.  Big, fat, juicy c**t.  I'm hungry.  Are we on the air anymore?  What happened?  What happened to the on-air light? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Um.  We got to back up.  Rob in Salem.  I'll back up into a c**t.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, enough.  Uh, Rob.  Very mad at me.  No surprise here.  What happened?  Rob in Salem, uh, Virginia.  Uh, OPU dope.  Does it not occur to you that people without electricity during a heat wave are probably  at friends' houses in AC watching TV or maybe they have a battery-operated TV so that they 
[01:07:00]  can find out what the hell is up?  Who has a battery-operated TV?  Who?  You name me one person with a battery-operated TV and I'll pick it up and smash their foot  with it.  That works.  No one has a battery-operated TV.  And you know what?  That's Stephen King novel, stupid.  And you know what, Rob?  Even if that's true, the amount of people that are affected that will actually be in  front of a TV at that moment are so slim it's not worth doing is what I'm saying.  Besides the fact that every single local station in New York was covering the exact same thing. 
[01:07:30]  So why didn't, what was it, ABC here in New York, why didn't they just have the balls  and say, you know what, someone else will cover this horse ass.  We're going to continue watching the British Open over here.  Because they're so afraid of you.  Here's the problem.  They're so terrified of losing viewers.  They're not really informing you of anything.  They're just terrified that you're going to tune out of this station.  You're going to tune out.  No one affected was watching golf even on their battery-powered television.  Oh, yeah.  And thank you, Anthony. 
[01:08:00]  So if you were affected because you had no electricity, the last thing you're doing  is hanging out at a friend's house watching the British Open.  I saw a report or heard a report from John Montone on 1010 Winds yesterday where he interviewed  somebody that was out of power.  I could not understand the person speaking.  I believe it was an Asian gentleman, but I can't be sure.  And it was, you know, they're not watching golf.  If the soccer, you know, if that was on the World Cup, then there would be a problem. 
[01:08:30]  Then I could see a lot of battery-powered TVs just lining the street, but not golf.  All right.  Let's see.  We have two more clips, thank God, and we'll move on.  Here we go.  More commentary.  More.  Paraguay.  Now, this is also a little bit of a surprise for me, but I can see why she made it in the  top 20.  She has an amazing body. 
[01:09:00]  I'm not so graceful on the snap and turn.  You know, swimsuit's one from the neck up here, and she doesn't have that energy.  Oh, I wasn't looking from the neck up.  What were you looking for?  I wasn't looking from the neck up.  Looking from the waist down.  Her lap was genuine, too.  I wasn't looking for the neck up.  I was looking at the page standing there on side stage.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.  And a lot of people are asking, is Carson serious with these jokes? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, this is what you get.  This is quality TV right here.  This is television.  All right, finally.  This is the last one, and then we can finally move on.  Argentina.  Sandy, don't cry for her, Argentina.  She is, she's so sweet looking.  She has the face of an angel, Carson.  She really does.  Beautiful face.  Ukraine.  I'm in love with this girl's hair.  Are you?  It's giving me a Ukraine headache. 
[01:10:00]  It looks like it hurts.  I think it's just, it's fresh.  You would know it hurts.  Oh, my God.  She got extra points for whipping her pareto around.  That was genius.  Great walk.  If anyone knows pain, it's Carson.  Boy, all the men that were lusting after these women.  I don't know how you guys, just, how do you watch this when you're laughing so hard?  At the gay guy.  The line's coming out.  And the woman fake laughing at him. 
[01:10:30]  The people enjoying this pageant relate to that humor.  Yeah.  That's a very, very in-touch way of looking at it.  They relate to that humor.  Just working Joes that want to see some semi-clad women.  They want to hear a gay guy's loud commentary because it's fun.  That's what they're used to around the job.  Why don't more people see it our way?  I don't get this.  Nathan in Massachusetts.  Nathan, your comment.  Yeah.  The reason they have a gay guy on here doing this is because if it's a guy who's, you know,  like you or me, you know, who actually checks these women out on a regular day-to-day basis, 
[01:11:00]  they're like, oh, this guy's a chauvinist pig.  Look at him.  He's such a slob.  Who cares?  It's the Miss Universe pageant.  Yeah, the whole contest is based on chicks just being hot.  You don't need to cover it up.  We all know that everybody, you know, looks at these girls and says, oh, yeah, I totally  bang her.  Holy crap.  You know, it's like, you know, and then there's a guy, oh, look, he's so cute.  We know he really doesn't care.  Right, exactly.  But that is why they don't want it to come off as too chauvinistic.  They're trying to be sophisticated.  It's a hot chick contest. 
[01:11:30]  You don't want to be chauvinistic.  Then show a bunch of fat girls doing geometry.  It's one step above a wet t-shirt contest.  Barely.  Barely.  It's a cable-fitted wet t-shirt contest.  Screw the sophistication.  They're a bunch of hooahs.  They're dumber than a box of rocks.  And you just want to see their snatches.  It's funny if it's a gay guy.  It's rude if it's a straight guy.  All right, guys.  Thanks for taking my call.  Punching out.  Sorry, but, you know, that's what we're looking at. 
[01:12:00]  That's pretty much it.  We're all wondering what they look like naked.  That's it.  We don't give a crap if they want to save the world or go into journalism or broadcasting.  Or what a gay guy thinks about any of them.  Oh, you're the one that's going to cure AIDS, are you?  Yeah, you're going to be the one.  The dumb bimbo from a third world nation.  Yeah.  Please.  Shut up and show us your naughty parts. 
[01:12:30]  Show us the dirty areas.  Show us the areas you have to clean in the shower a little more than the others.  Right.  That's what we want to see as men.  Show us those areas where you're just ashamed.  Show us the areas that you use that special washcloth for.  Show us the areas that give you validity as a human.  Show us the areas you have and that are the only reasons we talk to you.  Show us the areas that get you free dinner and movies. 
[01:13:00]  Show us the areas that you use the same soap that your dad uses to wash his face.  Oh, yeah.  I screwed it up.  Show us the areas that never smell like the back of your neck or your arms.  Show us the areas that leave marks on a linoleum when you sit the wrong way.  Show us the areas that would make a gay guy puke. 
[01:13:30]  Show us the areas that make the fruit roll-up sound when you do jumping jacks.  Show us the areas you have a special doctor for.  Show us the areas that force you to make less money than men.  My lines are okay. 
[01:14:00]  That's what we want to see.  My execution stinks.  That's very funny.  Show us the areas.  That's what we want to see as men.  Those.  Show us the areas that make us want to talk to you.  I said that one.  Oh, you did?  Did you really?  Yeah.  Show us the areas that make Opie pay more attention.  I'm trying.  I'm looking at feedback.  I'm trying to get some good calls on the air. 
[01:14:30]  Dan is yelling we have to take a break.  Oh, boy.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Get your wow stickers.  You throw it on your car.  There's girls out there that will show your boobs as you're driving to work.  Yes, they will.  It's a fact, okay?  Ooh.  What?  Mmm.  Some Tobago's?  I look at her Turks and Caicos.  Oh, did you?  Show us the areas that black men rip apart. 
[01:15:00]  That's Boobie Man.  And, of course, he's calling from Brooklyn.  Of course, Brooklyn.  He has personal.  Now all the shows your areas are coming in.  Show us the areas that make you bad at math.  There's Rob, who hated me a few moments ago.  See, we turned him around a little bit.  All right, and we'll get into the show.  It's the areas after the break because there's hundreds of them coming in now. 
[01:15:30]  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony wow stickers are your tickets to a successful Whip  Them Out Wednesday.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that wow stickers have many other uses?  I built my entire house out of wow stickers and two-by-fours.  Solid as a rock.  Oh, crap.  I'm not insured.  Opie and Anthony!  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, it's Whip Them Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:16:00]  Get your wow stickers on your cars and your trucks and your motorcycles.  There are women out there flashing as we speak.  Let's say hi to, uh...  Ah, I hung up.  Ah, we were gonna go to ya.  And then people would laugh and laugh and laugh.  I was gonna use a caller to set up a little Andrew Dice Gay.  Aw.  Someone was suggesting that Andrew Dice Gay should have been one of the commentators at the Miss Universe pageant. 
[01:16:30]  Oh.  Would have been beautiful.  I think Andrew Dice Gay might make an appearance at some of the ONA virus events.  Yeah, you're gonna...  See what I'm hearing?  You hear?  You're gonna be at the ONA traveling virus?  Yeah, I'm thinking of going there and doing some rhymes.  Some of my old act.  But I updated for the new me.  You know, the faggot me.  The one that loves big fat... 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, huh?  I like a man's...  Yeah.  ...to just be loose.  Yeah, I don't like the, uh, uh, uh, virgins.  Not me.  I like a big sloppy s*** on a man.  I want the s*** to be so gooey and loose, I don't need no effort.  I could just faggot up with him anytime.  Bend over.  Uh, guise. 
[01:17:30]  Uh, guise.  I'm a faggot.  Did you watch the Miss Universe pageant?  I wouldn't have missed it.  Yeah, Carson there from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.  I love that guy.  I want his s*** in my s***.  Because I'm gay now.  Eww.  Where's my yam bag?  That's what I call him.  My little yam bag.  Eww.  Hickory dickory dock. 
[01:18:00]  The new dice loves s***.  I used to do an act.  You know, where I dug the chicks?  Yeah.  Remember a long time ago?  Do you remember?  Of course we remember.  A long time ago.  Yeah.  I would do this act where I go, so I'm on line with this chick at the bank, and I got my s*** up a s***.  Remember that one?  It's a classic.  It was all a lie. 
[01:18:30]  It was.  It was all a lie.  I was living a lie.  You know, you put yourself out there, and people laugh at you.  When the truth of the matter is, I was yearning for s***.  I needed it.  It's like fuel for me.  You know, a woman's s*** are like kryptonite to me.  I'm horrified by them. 
[01:19:00]  Horrified.  But men.  Men got what I want.  Men.  Hairy-chested men.  You hear?  You hear?  I'm not here.  You hear me?  Say you hear me?  I'm deaf right now.  I don't hear crap.  Because when there's nothing like, you know, I would talk about chicks and bedding them down,  and, you know, oh, they'd be in the bed going, oh, dice, I love you, and I'd go, get out of here.  You know why?  Why?  Because deep inside, I wanted big, fat man s***. 
[01:19:30]  Who wouldn't?  Oh, wait, a friend's coming over.  A friend's coming over.  Yeah.  Hi there, Bruce.  How are you?  Yeah, I'll give you the normal greeting.  Oh, did I need that? 
[01:20:00]  There ain't nothing like a guy shooting s*** right in your face.  Hi, oh, here's another friend.  Billy's coming over.  Oh, they're lined up outside the door.  It's my friend Billy.  Hi, I'm Andrew Dice Gay.  Bruce brought you over.  Here's my greeting.  Oh, I love to taste the man's s***. 
[01:20:30]  It's great.  I take it in the s***, in my s***, up the s***, in my s***, on my s***, in the s***, at a s***, in the s***, up the s***, through the s***, wherever.  Who are you?  Come here.  It's like having a fresca.  It's so refreshing when a guy shoots his s*** all over, in my s***, on my s***, through my s***, in my s***. 
[01:21:00]  I don't care anywhere.  Come here.  Jack, be nimble.  Jack, be quick.  Hey, Jack, pull out your s***.  No!  Look at me.  I look like a glazed donut.  Because it's all over me. 
[01:21:30]  All this man s***, all over my s***, in my s***, through my s***, in my s***, on my s***, on my s***.  In, through, at s***, s***, near s***, fall.  Because when they s***, one, right in my s***, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, it's heaven.  Heaven.  Oh, one more somebody.  Yeah, there's another person at the door there.  Hello, it's the UPS guy. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  You got a package for Andrew Dice Gay?  Go!  Oh, what a delivery of s***, right in my s***.  All right, all right, we get it, we get it.  Give us the paper towel.  Thank you.  So, you're going to be at the ONA Traveling Virus doing a little something in front of everybody.  Yeah.  Well, we're here. 
[01:22:30]  We're here.  It's all wet here.  The ONA Traveling Virus.  Banana Joe.  It's all the comedians you know and love from this show.  All the info is up on opiananthony.com.  We got a special announcement for Boston today because Bob Saget blew us off yesterday.  He's going to be calling this side of the show, hopefully in about a half hour, 40 minutes.  All right?  So, Boston, make sure you're listening around 830.  Holy crap, is that good.  Messiest bit ever. 
[01:23:00]  What bit?  And then some ass.  Why are you bleeping?  Oh, Jesus.  Are you kidding?  Was I bleeping?  You're not bleeping on XM, you know.  I think I was talking over the bleep.  Of course you were.  Jack Hayes.  Bill from Waterford, show us the areas that make you take all $40,000 out of my bank account.  I'm just...  What happened?  I'm breaking everything.  The screw just came out of the...  The screw! 
[01:23:30]  It just came out of the microphone.  Well, did it break or...  The fan will fix it for me.  Yeah, they're fixing your mic.  Crystal on Long Island, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to say, could you guys not get fired?  Well, we try, we try, and we try.  Because I would have no...  That's good.  ...walks into the city would be horrible.  All right, Crystal.  We'll try to be here for a while, but, you know, we've got to take it right to the edge.  We've got to continue taking it right to the edge. 
[01:24:00]  All right, thanks.  All right.  You're back functioning there?  Yeah, I think the microphone is.  Andrew Dice Gay.  Oh, was he here?  Did I miss him?  Wow, that was a little too real.  Sure know a lot about blowholes.  It's going to be fun to see him make a little appearance.  Yeah.  The jacket's being made as we speak. 
[01:24:30]  I hear.  I hear there might be a jacket and...  Tickets available through a ticket master.  The ONA traveling virus.  All right, here we go.  Oswald from Whackbag.  Oh, yeah.  We can't say that website yet.  Is that the deal, right?  I don't think so.  All right.  It's a Whackbag, right?  It just doesn't mean anything.  Nah, they dump out every time we say it.  So, well, Oswald from one of our fan sites.  All our fan sites are linked through opieandanthony.com.  Show us the areas that made Opie climb up an apple tree. 
[01:25:00]  Show me your area where an old whoopsie-daisy will have a stewed tomato falling out of it.  Oh, my God.  That's Internet Stalker Z.  The old whoopsie-daisy.  That's from Massachusetts.  Mike C. from Massapequa Park.  Show us the areas that make us want to buy you Fidelity Diamonds.  And Dave from Little Rock, Arkansas.  Show us the areas that make Jimmy pull out his wallet at 3 a.m. in the morning.  They continue to come in.  All right.  It's time for just one. 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  Because a lot of people love this bin.  Some people think it's getting a little tired.  We understand.  And we may have a news tease for the News Tease Hall of Fame.  It's just one today.  It's worth playing.  I love them all.  For the new markets, go screw.  Yeah.  We don't have time to explain this.  You see them during your favorite shows, and they try to terrify you and make you watch the news.  That's pretty much it.  Exactly.  Well, here's – and then we listen to the scary news teases, and eventually we add some to the News Tease Hall of Fame. 
[01:26:00]  Here's one.  The problem solvers have uncovered sexual predators sent to live in our nursing homes.  Do you really know who's living down the hall?  Could this happen to your mother?  Could this happen to your mother?  Oh.  Sexual predators at old age homes?  Why not happen to your father?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oof.  Why only mom?  Why is mom the only one at risk?  How guilt-ridden would you be? 
[01:26:30]  You put your parents in a home.  He came in.  It was three in the morning.  I've been here.  I didn't know what was happening.  Oh, mom.  It's okay.  No.  Are you okay, mom?  No, man.  I'm pretty effing far from okay.  Your father confesses how the orderlies always made him wear the open-backed hospital, Johnny.  Time to take your temperature, Mr. Smith. 
[01:27:00]  Not again.  Why is your thermometer always bigger than I remember?  And black.  Right.  I've seen it in Popular Mechanics.  There's a new one that takes it in your ear.  In your what?  Your ear.  Oh.  They put it in your ear where you hear out of, and the temperature comes up on what they 
[01:27:30]  call a digital display.  Why are you still taking my temperature like it's 1880?  And he wants to know why there have to be two men taking his temperature at the same  time.  Why does this man pay him to take my temperature?  Why are there two men, and why do I have to hold two thermometers also?  Oh, the news stinks. 
[01:28:00]  That is horrible.  No one wants to think about their mom being sexually abused at an old age home.  Only the news would bring you this wonderful sight.  The problem solvers have uncovered sexual predators sent to live in our nursing homes.  Do you really know who's living down the hall?  Could this happen to your mother?  There, Mike fell.  There, Mike fell.  Mike is falling apart. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, well.  Hey, hey.  Billy?  It's mommy.  At the home.  Yes.  I've needed some stitches.  They hurt me very badly.  You've got to get me out of here.  Can I go?  Mom, your imagination.  Yeah.  Can I go?  Can I come live with you in your guest room?  Oh, yeah.  Hi.  No, this is the orderly here. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  She's been having a bad night.  She's been hallucinating.  No, no, I'm not hallucinating.  No, I swear they're doing awful things to me here.  Awfully nice, right?  Right.  We got your birthday cake last week.  Get me out of here.  It hurts where it hasn't hurt for years.  You know, my mom was at a nursing home after the accident a couple years ago.  Oh, God. 
[01:29:30]  God bless people that work in those places.  The ones that have a heart.  Because there are people that work in there, and it's just a job, and it pays them good money.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, there you go.  And you're on?  I probably am.  I just got to change headphones.  All right.  Hold on.  All the mics are falling apart after Andrew dice cake.  That's better.  There we go.  Yeah.  It hurts so bad.  I can only eat mashed potatoes and applesauce for three weeks. 
[01:30:00]  But I just don't like the spoon they give it to me on.  We can fix that during the break.  Please.  Yeah.  We're going to break in about two minutes.  Sure.  Ant's got another mic.  He's good.  He's good right now.  But two years ago, after the accident, my mom was in a nursing home recovering and stuff,  and I'd go there to visit.  It's just that I'm living in a nightmare to begin with, and making sure my mom's all right 
[01:30:30]  and stuff.  And then I would be walking out, and they would have the old people in the hallways in their  wheelchairs and stuff.  Help.  Because that was like recreation.  Get them out of their room and into the hallway.  As long as they're out of their room, they're recreating.  And then all of a sudden, just out of nowhere, one of these old ladies would just grab you  and just start screaming, help me, help me, help me.  And you just think they're crazy.  But perhaps things are happening.  And they got that, I don't know, that old lady strength or something. 
[01:31:00]  You can't knock them off you.  You can't knock them off.  It's called just backhander.  That strength, that comes from 75 years of dignity being removed nightly.  Oh, my God.  I know, they get those talons in your arm.  They don't let go.  Yeah, you don't want to just slap their arm off you, you know?  You're trying to pull their arm off your shirt.  They're just pulling at you.  Help me, help me, help me.  Shut up, you old bag. 
[01:31:30]  The lady that cut the little corners off your sandwiches now is standing there just making  a butter-churning motion in the middle of the hallway alone, while three black orderlies  play Eenie, Miney, Moe with her and Mavis.  What happened to Meanie?  Did I say Eenie, Miney, Moe?  Yeah.  You left out a little Meanie.  Well, it's just faster to go Eenie, Miney, Moe, because those boys can't wait.  Meanie was arrested.  Oh, man.  That is horrible.  Nursing homes.  Yeah.  Just a nightmare. 
[01:32:00]  But again, I just, I think that's...  And then you walk by rooms and some lady's celebrating her 95th birthday and her son's  there who doesn't even want to be there.  He's got some young chippy and he's just doing his duty and dropping off a birthday card and  a cupcake.  Yeah.  And she's just staring at the ceiling.  Gotta go, Mom.  And the son is like, open up your birthday card.  Oh, it's just horrific.  And her big day, she walks around saying, look at what my son brought me.  Right. 
[01:32:30]  Look at what my son brought me.  Yeah.  Oh, let me see.  Oh, a square satin pillow.  How nice.  As he's back on his Harley with his young wife.  Out of sight, out of mind.  Driving out to the Hamptons.  Oh, I did my duty.  I stopped by for 10 minutes.  Oh.  My grandma's in one of those, like, homes.  Oh, it's awful.  I haven't been there.  I see her on holidays.  I'm not going.  What, they drag her?  They take her out for holidays? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  She's good.  She just, like, she just can't be, like, alone.  She falls down or something like that, you know.  But she's got her senses.  But I don't go.  I'm not going to want to go into one of those places.  The smell alone will kill you.  How much is it to have someone take care of them at home?  It's a lot of money.  Mom and dad, get ready.  That's it.  Oh, believe me.  I'm packing you into a rented van.  Find the cheapest place possible.  Because I know when my mother and the rest of the family was, like, shopping around for a place to put grandma, 
[01:33:30]  they would go to some places that were just awful.  And my mother would tell me, you know, this place is pretty inexpensive and there's a reason for it, you know.  Right, right.  It's just people that don't take care of anybody.  There's people laying in their own stuff and, you know, nurses that don't care.  And then there's places that are, like, an apartment building.  Yeah, they're high-end.  Old people, high-end.  But it's going to cost you.  How much is that?  I don't even know. 
[01:34:00]  I don't know.  You think I contribute?  5,000 a month.  5,000 a month?  I think some of them are more, though.  Yeah.  Really?  I think one of my grandma's in is even more than that.  It's, like, ridiculous.  Yeah.  How much is it if you only have to feed them, like, once a day?  Really?  Do you get a little chart?  And how much if you let them have sex with your parents?  You get a little menu.  Feed them once a day.  Let's see.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me check this off.  How much does that take?  Like when you're building your own computer online. 
[01:34:30]  Let's see.  Mac and cheese is the cheapest.  Mac and cheese once a day.  I don't need the best video card.  What does it cost me now?  Sponge bath.  Once every two weeks.  Yeah.  She's not talking to anybody.  Right.  Give her a box of raisins.  She can eat that.  Right.  Enjoy.  Some raisins.  Enjoy.  Oh, the end of your life is just awful.  You live to be old.  All right.  We got a break again.  Is Mike here?  Mike Rose here, right?  From Shark Week? 
[01:35:00]  And he does dirty jobs, too, I believe.  Yeah.  That's a cool show.  He's got two really cool shows on TV.  I really have trouble watching that show because he gets himself into some disgusting jobs.  Well, we'll talk to him next.  But first, it's Aaron in Michigan.  Aaron.  Yes.  Hey.  What's up, man?  Hey.  Checking in, punching in, guys.  I just want to explain the virus to some of these new listeners.  It's when you go to bed early just because you can't wait to the next episode of Jimmy and Friends. 
[01:35:30]  Also, next year's...  Friends?  Yeah.  Next year's Miss Universe is going to be commentated by Rocky Balboa and a glass table.  Punch it out.  He's an old timer.  Okay.  There you go.  It's a callback.  It's a callback.  We'll explain it another day.  It's the only virus spreading across America on this fine Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.

[01:36:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're so distracted.  We're supposed to be doing a radio show.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Something's going on with the local news.  It's the great news wars.  Right.  The horror wars that they are trying to pull.  They know that they can only do so much with news and guys doing the news.  Now I'm looking at Channel 5 News here in New York.  I don't think it's the Fox News channel. 
[01:37:00]  It's just local.  There is a girl sitting there that is like now hotter than the other chick from Channel 11.  I vote her hotter than the Channel 11 chick.  Oh, there's a...  What does she do this one?  What does she do but sit there and look 16?  With a cleavage shot.  This is unbelievable.  This is just like Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw going at it. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, of course it is.  They're just trying to top each other with the hot chicks on local TV here in New York.  Do we even know why she's on TV?  Why she's on there?  Who is she?  She's trying to look serious right now.  Where does she come from?  She's talking about TV, I guess.  I don't know.  There's someone on the phone.  We'll have to get the audio.  Yeah, figure it out.  Figure out who she is.  We got the newest, hottest girl in the news.  Let's say hi to Mike Rowe.  We can't get enough of local TV. 
[01:38:00]  God bless you.  We're obsessed with local TV and how stupid it has become.  Can't watch enough of it.  Can't make fun of it enough.  Local news.  Nothing like it.  That's where I came from.  Well, I didn't come from it, but I worked for a local news station.  Did you?  San Francisco, dreadful, yeah.  San Francisco, local news.  It's all the same, man.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter what town you're in.  Turn on the local news.  There it is.  Same girl.  Well, not that girl, but it's the same guy, same makeup, same suit, same story, same  well-modulated baritone.  Well, you have the voice for it.  You got the crazy voice.  Don't hold it against me.  You got the voice. 
[01:38:30]  You do radio ever?  I tried it years ago.  I wasn't very good.  No?  You know, it was okay.  I just, it was perplexing, you know, and-  Tell me about it.  It's baffling.  You know, I mean, you guys are in the plaza suite here.  I mean-  Yeah, this is pretty nice digs.  Yeah, nice people sitting around.  I'm sitting on a red leather couch.  This is fantastic.  Yeah, it's supposed to look like lips.  Oh.  We hate it.  Well, I'm sitting on lips then.  David Lee Roth ordered them when he was working here. 
[01:39:00]  He'll do that.  Yeah.  For the week he was here.  That was a heck of a run, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bozy, bozy, bop.  Diddy-bye.  Dave, leave.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Can get bozy, bop out of here, please.  Yeah, bozy, bozy, bop out the door.  The cleaning crew.  That's not a word.  Waiting to clean up.  Right.  You hosting Shark Week.  It's true.  Yeah, that's good.  We love Shark Week.  It's taken off.  I remember like the first one. 
[01:39:30]  19 years ago.  This is the best show ever.  This is, I mean, I didn't know this either.  I mean, when I got the call, I thought they were kidding because, I mean, if you've seen  Dirty Jobs, I'm not the likeliest candidate to entrust with the longest running franchise  in cable television, but they convinced me they were serious, so we said, yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Why not?  And what does it take to host?  Do you have to get yourself into some dangerous situations?  I guess, you know?  I mean, it's, you know, the whole danger thing is as bad as the local news.  It gets trumped up to a place where most of the time you need to look at it, you know, 
[01:40:00]  with one eye sort of shut and smirk on your face.  But the truth is, you know, a thing scared the hell out of me for about a month straight.  And we were in Cape Town.  We were in cages with great whites.  We were off the coast of Bimini without a cage and a shark suit.  I was going to ask, you did the whole cage thing.  Listen, I mean, I spend a fair amount of my average day scared of something, and I'm not shy about admitting it.  And I was perpetually and consistently horrified for about a month, you know. 
[01:40:30]  And in the end, you know, you learn a little something, you have a few laughs, and you get a new perspective on sharks.  Once you make it through, it seems like it was really cool.  It's one of the things when you're doing it, you cross it off the list, and you go, huh, how about that?  I got bit by a shark.  I'll never do that again.  Did one nail you?  Oh, yeah.  Dozens, actually.  Jesus.  Dozens.  I met a complete lunatic and a great guy called Jeremiah Sullivan who invented this shark suit about 30 years ago.  It's basically a suit of armor. 
[01:41:00]  Right.  Chain link almost.  Chain link.  But it's more like hosiery.  It's so, you know, it's so flexible.  So picture 400,000 of these tiny little stainless steel rings, all individually TIG welded overseas by very meticulous people.  And you put the thing on, you look like Sir Galahad on a bender.  Chain mail.  And the job, you know, on dirty jobs, you go do a job as best you can and see what happens.  That was the same sensibility for Shark Week.  But the gig was go make the shark suit and then watch as Jeremy tests it. 
[01:41:30]  But, of course, that was completely nonsense.  You know, you put the suit on, Mike.  You go test it.  So, you know, we basically go off the back of a boat.  We create a chum slick first.  So we've got about three dozen 12-foot reef sharks.  And I'm not even kidding, man.  These are gray with the big teeth in there just frothing at the water.  12 feet.  12 feet long, 10 feet long.  They go crazy.  We put on the suit.  We jump in the middle of them.  And we sink to the bottom of the ocean.  And we've got a chum bucket down there. 
[01:42:00]  And we basically move the frenzy from the surface to the floor.  And then we let them bite us, you know.  And it's just, it's mad.  I mean, it's crazy.  I've got cameramen around me.  They're looking at me shaking their head.  I'm looking at Jeremiah.  And he's not looking back because his head's where his ass was.  He's upside down being dragged across the ocean floor and shook like a tug toy.  Yeah, now the chainmail would protect against punctures.  Yeah.  But you're still getting the pressure of a bite.  Yeah.  Which I hear is pretty strong. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And, yeah, they shake.  Sure they do.  And they pull you around.  So you're still getting the ride of the shark bite.  And even then, it's still half-hearted.  I mean, if these things really, truly wanted to tear you to pieces, they could.  And they would.  They really don't.  And, you know, sharks are curious.  They're playing with you.  Well, they investigate with their teeth, unfortunately.  And they don't have the opposable thumb thing.  So all they have to do is just kind of touch you with their mouth.  And, you know. 
[01:43:00]  They realize that.  Unfortunately, that's also the business end.  That's the business end.  They realize that you're not good eats.  No.  And they let go.  No, especially wrapped in steel.  I mean, it's all put in.  You ever bite into aluminum?  I mean, it's got to be like twice as bad as that.  That would be hysterical if the shark felt the same thing.  Like, ow, damn it.  What the heck?  Just kind of swimming away going, my filling.  My filling.  You're not a shark dentist.  Wait, you can't test that with a great white, right?  You can't let a great white bite your arm like that.  Jeremiah's working on what I can only imagine is like a 12th century suit of armor to do 
[01:43:30]  that very thing.  But like I said, he's crazy.  And I don't think he can do it.  No, I think it'd be a terribly ill-advised mistake.  One of the rumors that if a great white's attacking, a newspaper across the nose will actually  stop it.  Newspaper?  That's actually true.  That's been proven many times.  So should you find yourself in that situation?  With a newspaper?  Yeah, rolled up posts.  Reading the times down here on the reef.  Just headbutt the great white.  You'll be fine.  Yeah.  That way he can bite your head off and end it quickly and not have to be bleeding to 
[01:44:00]  death from a leg wound.  You ever see that footage of the woman that gets bitten and then they pull her out and  you can see that's the worst footage ever taken?  Oh, where they pull her out into that boat and her leg is just gone.  Yeah, gone.  The blood is just pouring out of her.  See, here's the thing, man.  I mean, I've seen that in what last year there were nine fatalities, maybe 250 attacks.  Three times as many people died from ostriches.  Ostriches?  And I wrangled ostriches and, you know, I can see how it's true, but, you know, there's 
[01:44:30]  no ostrich week.  The ostrich isn't getting impressed.  Not very scary.  Also, 200 people died from toasters.  We found out that in the United States alone, yeah, more people died from vending machines  falling on them than sharks.  Trying to get the change out.  But there isn't any vending machine week.  Yeah, just trying to tip the thing out or something and fell on them and killed them.  Well, a vending machine never chased anyone and then ripped its leg off.  Yeah, perhaps there would be.  If a tad machine ripped your arm off, there'd be a tad machine week. 
[01:45:00]  And you can see the vending machine.  I mean, that's really the thing.  Yeah, true.  You can see it coming.  It's just sitting there, kind of inert, you know.  You really have to taunt a vending machine for it to hurt you.  Get some action.  Hey, you also narrate World's Deadliest Catch?  That's true.  God, you got like three of the cool shows on TV.  I do, yeah.  Yeah, on the same doggone show, too.  Go figure.  Dirtiest job.  I love World's Worst Deadliest...  What's the name of the show again? 
[01:45:30]  Deadliest Worst Awful...  Disastrous Catch.  Yeah, it's a nightmare to TiVo, but it's a good show.  Anthony, turn me on.  World's Deadliest Catch.  Anthony, turn me on to this show.  I can't get enough of it.  I never thought crabbing would be interesting to watch on television.  You just never knew what went behind it and how dangerous this job is.  No, it's beyond insane.  Yeah.  I mean, if you read the actuarial tables, which a friend of mine sent me before I went up to Dutch Harbor.  I actually hosted the first season. 
[01:46:00]  I'll get back to it in a second if you find it at all interesting.  But really, what happened, the network called and said, hey, we're going to do a story on these crabbers.  And my folks are fishermen, you know.  So I figured, oh, I know a little bit about it.  Where are we going to go?  You know, maybe we'll go down to South Carolina.  Maybe we'll go to Chesapeake Bay in Baltimore.  Oh, yeah.  I was like, no, dude.  We're going to Dutch Harbor, Alaska, Bering Sea, dead of winter.  I'm like, oh, that sounds dangerous.  So I get this actuarial chart, and I swear to God, the injury rate on the crab fleet for an average season is 100%. 
[01:46:30]  If you're on a crab boat and you're fishing for a season, you're going to get hurt.  In some way, shape, or form.  The catastrophic injury rate is 12%.  That means there's a one in ten chance, a finger, a crushed pelvis, you know, something that puts you in a hospital.  What if the mechanism is in the water or something?  Grab your hand as you're holding it.  It's probably a variety of things.  There is so much equipment, frozen equipment, swinging around the deck that these guys have to know where everything is at every moment. 
[01:47:00]  Huge pots, these cages that they lower into the water and then pull back up, and hopefully for them it's full of crabs.  But as they're doing it, you know, one's coming up after another, and it's another guy's job to dump it,  and guys are taking and making sure that there are keepers and the small ones have to be thrown back.  All this is happening at once in a frozen environment where, you know, it would be dangerous if you were just walking down a sidewalk with that type of ice. 
[01:47:30]  These guys, the boats are just flying all over the place.  A crab pot weighs 800 pounds.  800 pounds.  Every edge of it is sharp.  It's sliding across a frozen deck.  There are 30 like it on deck.  The winds are blowing 40 knots.  The seas are 15, 20 feet.  You haven't slept in five days.  Yeah.  Good luck.  You ask yourself who are the people that do this, and the only thing I could find by watching the show is lunatics, complete crazy people. 
[01:48:00]  You've got people who have no idea what they're signing on for and you have people who have been doing it 30 years.  Because the ones in the middle wash out.  But the final thing on the actuarial chart is the mortality rate, which is one a week.  Now, I completely dismissed all this, right?  I was there six weeks, a year and a half ago.  Six guys died.  Yeah, that ship went down.  I saw three catastrophic injuries.  And, I mean, it's the truth, man.  Guys on your ship died or like over the whole?  There were 148 boats in the fleet that year. 
[01:48:30]  One of the boats went down, five guys on that boat died, and while the rescue was going on, a guy got washed over a boat not far.  And if you fall in that water up there, you've got two minutes, maybe.  And they had footage of the captain talking, which was really, like, creepy.  Oh, it's just, I mean, yeah.  It was just bad.  What catastrophic injuries did you see?  I turned my ankle on a step in a hotel.  For me.  I mean, have you ever?  That's catastrophic, man.  I slipped on some of my money one time.  You know when the side of the coffee table hits your shin and you're getting water? 
[01:49:00]  That'll hurt.  That'll hurt.  You know, one time I was eating king crab, and those are sharp, and I cut my hand.  Did you get the spice?  And the lemon got in there.  And it was catastrophic.  I was at a crab restaurant, and they gave me back my black American Express card, and that's made of platinum.  Asses.  No, what did you see on a boat like people getting hurt?  The first night I was there, a crab pot came untethered, slid across the deck, and crushed a guy's pelvis. 
[01:49:30]  A Coast Guard Jayhawk came and plucked it.  Yeah, they had to take him off the boat.  800-pound crab pot into your hog?  Yeah.  That's got to hurt.  Awful.  You know, honestly, it is so, it takes a while to get your head around it, you know, but the reason it's such interesting TV, aside from the human stories, it's just that basic conceal and reveal.  What's in the pot, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  And they're pulling up the pot.  And you know, maybe there's crab, maybe there's not.  I mean, how excited can I be?  Sometimes you find yourself interested in, are they going to get crabs? 
[01:50:00]  Sometimes I guess bear, by the way.  I guess bear.  You never know.  You don't know what's under that water.  Could be a big, vicious bear in there.  Pull it up as a tranny.  I got to throw it back.  Hi, Daddy, I'm cold.  Get back in there.  Bear week.  You do really, because the people, you watch the show and you realize the people are a little crazy, but they're such personalities.  They have such, you're not going to find a boring guy on one of these boats.  They all have these strange, weird personalities that, yeah, you kind of root for a ship to pull in a lot of crab. 
[01:50:30]  And when you see the captain, you know, using whatever knowledge he has, trying to lay down the pots where he thinks there's going to be crab, and then it comes time where they're pulling up.  You are.  And I wanted to hit myself that I was so interested in if these guys are going to pull up pots full of crabs.  Yeah.  Well, you know, a lot of, I mean, for me, after being up there six weeks, that's when I really started to think about dirty jobs, this other thing that kind of evolved. 
[01:51:00]  And, you know, there's so many people in the country who are willing to do stuff that most of us, you know, really never even consider.  And what's interesting about the crab fishing guys is, you know, right boat, right captain, and a little bit of luck, you can make $40,000, $50,000 in a week.  Wow.  Wow.  Now, that's changing because Congress has passed something called the Crab Rationalization Act, which is changing the essential way fishing is allowed to happen.  But for a long, long time, you know, that was the Wild West. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, would you take a pay cut like that to go crabbing?  No.  I have a shellfish analogy, so I'm pretty much out of that.  It will make crabs cheaper for you and I, though.  We're the ones that actually suffer in the end.  We're the ones that suffer.  Think about it, really.  I mean, the price is for king crab.  Come on.  That's a little too ridiculous.  The price is very high.  And I don't mean a human talk.  Are these guys' lives really that important?  I mean, come on. 
[01:52:00]  What else were they going to do anyway?  They were on their last leg.  They've lost 10 jobs, three wives.  They're alcoholics.  You do kind of describe a few of them.  Right, well.  It's true.  And because of that, I got to pay what?  For a lousy king crab?  Why are they so hard to catch?  Dirty jobs.  Now, I've seen a couple of these where, uh-uh.  Yeah.  I don't know what they're paying you, but it's not enough.  Hundreds of dollars.  I think we should tell Mike.  In the tens of dollars.  I know we're hanging out with a real man here, but I got to tell Mike. 
[01:52:30]  Anthony, uh, germaphobe.  No, no, no, no.  No, don't.  Everyone gets that wrong.  What do you call it?  Jimmy and I call it a germaphobe.  Disgusting-aphobe.  Like, I don't care about germs.  Someone sneezes in the room.  I'm not going to go crazy.  It's disgusting, sticky, smelly things.  What about the straw that was left on your, uh, little counter there?  I don't know whose that was.  It had nothing to do with germs.  It was disgusting.  It was like spittle.  Mike Rowe.  It was a bit of spittle on it.  Mike Rowe laughs at you. 
[01:53:00]  You screamed and yelled, and we had to have, like, some kind of hazmat team come in and  remove it.  Right.  I needed some Lysol spray.  Disgusting things disgust me.  And with Dirty Jobs, you are in a lot of disgusting situations.  I saw one, a trailer for one of the shows.  I didn't even understand what you had to do.  Yeah.  And I was disgusted.  It was something with the bones.  Oh, man.  And I think I saw a pig head.  Sure.  A bison head.  A bison head.  Yeah, yeah.  And the smell, the faces you make interpret the smell perfectly. 
[01:53:30]  Sadly, the medium in question has not perfected smell-o-vision.  Yeah.  So if it had, we would never have made it on the air.  The things I have smelled, honestly.  Yeah, you could just tell it reeks.  What was this?  That place was in Oklahoma City called Skulls International.  And this place.  Now, look, it's funny you mention that one because we've done over 100, and there have 
[01:54:00]  only been a couple that have come back from the network that's like, look, I mean, thanks  for trying.  Oh, really?  No, and we kind of fixed it to get it on the air the way you saw it.  But originally, I'll tell you what, every morning at Skulls International is beyond shocking.  UPS comes.  They deliver dozens of boxes.  And in the boxes are heads, heads of any imaginable creature.  And what these guys do is they unpack the severed heads, and they flens them. 
[01:54:30]  They take the flesh off, and they prepare the skulls.  People, universities, hospitals, museums, all kinds of places need fully articulated skulls,  fully articulated creatures, in fact.  In many cases, they'll send the whole bear.  They'll send the whole dog.  People want their pets turned into skeletons after they've died, you know?  And I don't know why this is, but there is some odd aftermarket out there. 
[01:55:00]  Anyway, these guys do the work.  And they're not ghouls, but, man, I'll tell you.  There's got to be a little ghoulish element in there.  I mean, we've all smelled interesting things just driving down the highway from time to time  and wondered, huh, what is that?  Is it a paper plant?  Is it a treatment plant?  Well, in Oklahoma, if the wind's right and you turn off the interstate just so,  you're hit with a funk that would literally, it just changes the way you look at the world. 
[01:55:30]  And it skulls internationally.  That's bad.  Yeah, it's bad.  It's that bad.  So that rotted carcass smell is, like, throughout the entire building.  The smell of death.  It's throughout about five square blocks.  Yeah, they have their own septic system.  They have their own everything because they can't tap into anything municipal.  So what do the guys do to get by?  You mean for, like, money?  No, I mean as far as masking the smell, I guess.  Not one thing.  Really?  No, and this is what Anthony did.  Because we've heard all those tricks about what do the crime scene guys do? 
[01:56:00]  Vicks under the nose.  All that crap.  They don't do any of that.  Nothing.  Nothing.  They laugh at those guys.  Listen, the human capacity to adapt to whatever hell you're in is truly endless.  And, you know, there are a lot of lessons from dirty jobs.  But for me personally, having done 106 of them, you know, that's not the world I came from.  You know, that's just the world I'm in for the time being.  Well, that's why it's interesting because you're taking somebody that doesn't do it, you, throwing you into a situation like that. 
[01:56:30]  These guys are used to it.  They don't think twice about walking into it.  It's another day at work.  Another day at work.  But you take somebody that isn't used to it, they can really convey how disgusting some of these jobs are.  And we've got to stop right there.  We're really late.  We've got Mike Rowe.  You're going to continue with us, right?  No, I feel as though I've screwed up somehow.  You're giving us great radio.  Bob Saget's going to call in for a quickie because we've got to do a make good with Boston today.  But Mike Rowe's Shark Week starts next week on the Discovery Channel at 9 p.m. 
[01:57:00]  We'll continue with Mike in just a bit.  It's the one virus spreading across America.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I've got to go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony wow line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWME05.  That's 866-WOWME05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  Hello, Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:57:30]  Swallow, sorry.  Mike Rowe in studio doing a great job for us.  Don't forget, Shark Week starts next week on the Discovery Channel at 9 p.m.  It's one of the best weeks in television, man.  Oh, yeah.  It really is a lot of fun.  Everyone loves sharks.  Bob Saget checking in really fast.  Bob.  Hey. 
[01:58:00]  Hi, Bob.  We talked to Bob Saget on our XM show for about a half hour yesterday.  You killed for us, Bob.  Well, you're great, guys.  I'm sorry I missed yesterday morning.  I was watching the Discovery Channel.  Good man.  He does.  He says all the right things.  I get that show.  I re-edit it.  I play the theme from the Discovery Channel.  And if that doesn't get you off, nothing will.  You were supposed to call in with a special deal for Boston.  Yeah, there were some tickets.  I'm going to do it again.  I got one more offer because, you know, we got a big show coming up that I'm going to be on your thing.  Yeah.  All my friends are on that thing. 
[01:58:30]  Tracy Morgan and Ralphie May and Bill Burr and all those guys.  What is it?  The DCU Center in Worcester?  Yeah, a week from Saturday, August 5th.  Well, my deal is like an additional 500 tickets in honor of your call letters at $10.41, $10,041 a ticket.  I haven't seen that kind of a sale since kindergarten.  And I am personally going to take money out of my pocket to make up the difference in the ticket price.  Wait, whoops, can't find the money. 
[01:59:00]  But anyway.  I think they'll make it up.  They got it.  $10.41.  That's 500 more tickets at that price.  How much time do they have to fulfill that kind of a good obligation?  That is a bargain.  Yeah, the tickets go on sale at 9 a.m. for $10.41 for the ONA traveling virus at the DCU Center, August 5th.  Bob was supposed to do this deal yesterday.  We kind of did it yesterday because you overslept, Bob.  Okay, I'm working on this Penguin movie in Toronto as a director.  I'm just killing myself.  This better be funny for all this work, I'll tell you.  I got Penguin juice coming out of me. 
[01:59:30]  A Penguin movie?  Yeah, it's a takeoff on March of the Penguins.  It's R-rated, and it's narrated by Samuel L. Jackson.  Oh, no.  And the stars are me and my girlfriend Christina Applegate in it and Tracy Morgan and Louis Black and Monique.  We're the main Penguins.  Nice.  And then like 50 stars did me just solid favors and came in like Dane Cook and Carlos Mencia and just a lot of people.  Harvey Fierstein, Jason Alexander, Norm MacDonald.  Tons of people just did free voiceovers, practically free. 
[02:00:00]  They probably buy them like gummy bears or something.  That's a great idea, by the way.  It's funny.  It's a lot of Penguin sex.  It's like the Discovery Channel if it had Tourette's.  You got a lot of street cred out there to get your friends involved.  That's what it is.  I got a lot of stuff on the street, and I sold it to them.  And I had a dealer by the set.  It's true.  I'm very, very appreciative.  A lot of people came in.  They read the script.  I mean, for Sam Jackson to have read the script and then said, I'll go record it. 
[02:00:30]  It's a stoner movie, and nobody's really made one for a long time.  So we're working on it for nine months, and it's going to rear its ugly head in the next couple weeks coming out.  When does it come out?  Well, the baby of the birth of the movie, we'll have it done like end of next week physically,  and then in a couple months.  There's another big, we have to coordinate now because there's a big movie called Happy Feet,  a joyous family one, a computer-generated one from Warner Brothers, comes out mid-November.  So we have to navigate around that so you don't go take your kids to see an R-rated movie with penguins doing the deed in it. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, by accident, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you think you're going to go see Robin Williams and Nicole Kidman loving each other.  Maybe we can get Penguin Week on Discovery.  Oh, Penguin Week.  You know how dangerous those things are?  When penguins attack.  Yeah.  I'll float it.  Our whole plot point is that Christina Applegate is accidentally in the dark violated by Louis Black.  And he accidentally almost invades Damon Wayans, who screams, hey, buddy, that's my ass.  And then he bumps into Christina, and then it kind of ruins our relationship because I can't believe she was with someone else in that way as well. 
[02:01:30]  In that Penguin way?  Well, penguins supposedly have one entrance exit.  The whole deal is one thing, which I didn't know that worked.  I didn't, I'm not, the script is not written that way.  Let me put it that way.  Right, you didn't take into consideration biological or anatomical accuracy.  That's okay.  I really took some license.  We should have had a consultant. 
[02:02:00]  I used it as a, it's really a room that you would use multi-purpose in your apartment building.  That's how it's used.  But in our show, it's an exit and an entrance, and then just an all-around fun time.  Fits the story.  All right, sure.  Hey, Bob, we're running out of time, so.  Well, great, guys, I'll be on that date on Mooster, and then next Friday or, maybe it's a Saturday, right?  August 26th at PNC Art Center in Jersey.  Cool.  And then September 9th, Tweeter Center in the Philly area, and then September 23rd in Cleveland, the ONA Traveling Virus. 
[02:02:30]  All the info is on opiananthony.com.  But you're announcing this special, 500 more tickets at $10.41 go on sale at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster for the Boston Show, the DCU Center.  Good.  August 5th, all right?  Yeah, we'll have fun.  We'll kick the roof off.  Everybody will laugh.  That's what they need to do right now.  All right, Bob, we'll have you on again soon, and we'll go long form with you, all right?  Yeah, I like it long form.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  Thanks, guys.  All right, it's Bob Saget, everyone.  Bye.  Because we've got to get a few more things in with Mike Rowe here. 
[02:03:00]  We're learning a lot about you, Mike.  Bill has a question here.  Bill?  Yeah, I remember hearing something about Mike was involved with the Baltimore Opera.  No, those were the days, Bill.  Yeah, I've paid a lot of dues to a lot of dues collectors, and, you know, just trying to figure  it all out, mid-80s.  You know, I couldn't get in SAG.  I couldn't get in AFTRA.  I couldn't get arrested.  But if you join the opera, you got your AGMA card, which is a sister union, and then you  can buy your way into the real unions.  Oh, okay. 
[02:03:30]  So I figured, you know, I mean, I was singing in saloons at the time, and I thought, well,  I'd learn a couple arias and crash an audition, and they basically hired me.  I got my card, and I figured, okay, I'm set.  But the truth is, the opera was very cool, and, you know, I met a lot of girls and had  a really fun time and got to dress like a pirate for a while.  So, you know, looking back, it was an important time for me.  Good times.  I've never heard anyone say that the opera was cool before.  Yeah, well, you know what?  I mean, seriously, people are dressed up in the craziest costumes, screaming at the top 
[02:04:00]  of their lungs.  You're 23, 24 years old, and all the girls are graduate students from Peabody, and, you  know, whatever.  It's showbiz, right?  Can you still sing opera?  Can you still sing opera?  Opera always did a really great show, anyway, with that projecting libretto above it, so you  could tell what people were singing.  I'd imagine that the Baltimore Opera is like the minor leagues of opera, though.  Well, it's just up the road from the National Opera, so, uh, D.C., Baltimore, you know, 
[02:04:30]  it's not a bad company.  They've been around, I don't know, 40, 50 years.  Can you give us a little something?  Vecchia zimara senti iraslo pianto shende re sacria montio devi.  I don't even know what it means, but, you know, now imagine me dressed like a gladiator  doing that.  Oh, well, I am.  That sharky.  Jimmy sings a little opera, too, but he might be a little too shy today.  I don't know.  Come on, Jimmy.  That blew my throat out.  He's a little shy, but he does do opera, too. 
[02:05:00]  Do you want to give Mike just a little?  I'm shy.  Come on.  Just a little, Jimmy.  Mike Rowe, Shark Week, Discovery Channel, next week.  He's here.  Yeah.  Did you know it takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile?  That's tragic.  Wow.  It's a tragedy.  Yeah.  It's about a boy with a sweet disposition.  Physical deformation.  You got to hear Frank the Frowner.  That's Frank the Frowner.  Turn that frown upside down. 
[02:05:30]  He's a smile.  Popped into our show from time to time.  What a chick magnet that must be, for lack of a faggier 1981 term.  But, I mean, to be able to do that, no straight guys can do that.  That's fantastic.  Those were good times.  He's had a few jobs, though.  I mean, the home shopping, was it?  Sure.  Yeah.  No, I sold stuff in the middle of the night from 1989 to 1992 on QVC.  That was right after the opera.  I mean, I'm not kidding.  I don't know how you guys got into the business, but all I knew for sure in the mid-'80s was I 
[02:06:00]  didn't want to sit behind a desk or sit in traffic.  And somehow or other, there must be a way to figure the TV thing out.  This is a crooked road, you know?  Home shopping, opera, commercials.  I was the Tylenol guy for, like, two and a half years, you know?  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't remember that.  Take comfort in our strength, right?  That's it.  Trust me.  Anyway, yeah, I mean, whatever.  Next thing you know, people are actually watching you and paying you to crawl through a sewer  and meet people who do it for a living, and now you've got your own show.  I've got to ask the hack question. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Dirtiest job you did for the show.  There's a thing called a lift pump.  A lift pump is the last hands-on thing that works in a wastewater treatment plant.  Everything else is mechanized.  A lift pump weighs four and a half tons, and it resides at the bottom of a five-story shaft.  When it breaks, the shaft above it fills with the most unspeakable sewage you can envision.  When that happens, a man in a suit, and I don't mean, like, you know, a nice suit, a man in a hazmat suit,  has to go through a series of airtight doors, walk through hell, and take a cable and attach it to the top of the broken pump 
[02:07:00]  so it can be winched out of the shaft.  The sound that a four-and-a-half-ton lift pump makes when it breaks the seal of poo that's been holding it to the floor will haunt your dream.  It's a bad one.  You're like the perfect voiceover guy.  You got that voiceover voice.  You know, if there's a wildebeest trying to make it across the Serengeti but being slowly eaten by crocodiles and hyenas, 
[02:07:30]  the odds are good.  I'm telling you about that.  And it never works out for the wildebeest, by the way.  No, it never.  Hey, did you do the mate-the-horses job yet?  I did, yes.  For dirty jobs?  Oh, yeah.  I violated virtually every farm animal on the planet.  I have artificially inseminated cows, pigs, turkeys, horses.  I had a friend when I was going to school in the Rochester area, Geneseo, actually south of Rochester,  and that was his job to get through school, and he would leave for work on weekends, 
[02:08:00]  hungover as you-know-what, and with like a rain slicker on.  Farm fluffer.  Yeah, it's a heck of a thing.  Farm fluffer.  Rain slicker.  Yeah.  His whole job was to, yeah, make sure the job was done.  Get the sample.  Right.  And they're not very neat when it comes to the...  Hence the jacket.  Right, exactly.  Horses will never tell you when.  Yeah, right.  There's not a lot of romance, really, in the barnyard. 
[02:08:30]  But it's really important.  I mean, honestly, most breeding today is done with the help of some guy, you know, with the...  You know what I'm saying.  With the rain slicker on.  Artificially.  Let's go to...  Why is that, though?  They don't want them injuring themselves?  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  Yeah, so you've got a $9 million quarter horse.  Wow.  You know, doing it the way God intended, and it's awkward.  I was raised around horses, and I've seen it done the natural way, and it is vicious.  Seared in your retina for all time. 
[02:09:00]  It was really vicious.  There was this horse called Concho Pete.  Concho Pete was the stallion around the stable, and it was being mated with this Appaloosa  named Duchess Day, and they brought Concho Pete in, and Duchess Day was in season, and Concho  Pete got so worked up that I swear...  You can't even describe what it looked like.  Yeah.  And he, you know, he jumped up onto Duchess Day, and his front hooves just completely cut 
[02:09:30]  up our shoulders.  Sure.  Right to the bone.  Like, really brutal.  Yeah.  Just brutal.  And hot.  Yeah.  You ever see that footage from the Seattle farm?  That guy learning a lesson?  Wow.  That little rascally horse.  See that one.  As soon as the hands moved out of the way, that little fella scampered as he should have.  I'd hate to be him having to go to the pearly gates with that little story of what killed 
[02:10:00]  you.  Yeah, on your face on a gurney.  Playing to St. Peter with a silly goose you are.  Hey, a couple quick phone calls before we get out of here.  Second half of the show, we'll start on XM in about five, ten minutes.  Tony in Boston, what's up?  Hey, Mike.  Love you on Dirty Jobs.  Great show.  Can't wait to see you on Shark Week.  Thanks.  Tell you what, man.  Last night, I think it was the pest control in Louisiana, Vexcon, I think it was.  Good times. 
[02:10:30]  Can you, can you, I tell you what, man, I can take almost anything, but this is probably  the most haunting thing that I've ever seen, that someone would actually live in conditions  on it like this.  Can you touch and tell the story on that?  As well as, we're the passion behind the Vexcon, the lead guy there.  Can you touch on that a little bit?  Sure.  Bill Bretherton is the most unorthodox exterminator on the planet.  I met him in northern Louisiana outside of Shreveport a couple years ago.  He and his wife, Mary, dress in black from top to bottom, wear skull and crossbones, and 
[02:11:00]  have essentially waged a holy war against all living vexations.  If it crawls or stings or bites, Bill hates it, and he's sworn to kill it.  So in northern Louisiana, I mean, this is a heck of a thing.  He took me to a trailer park, had a roach problem, and just to show me basically how  the extermination business is different from state to state and place to place, and this  really is all out war.  This is pre-Katrina.  This is, you know, a couple years ago, but we walked into a trailer, and, you know, look, 
[02:11:30]  I'm not given to exaggeration or a hyperpole, but I'm not even kidding, man.  I thought I was looking at a moving wallpaper pattern.  There were between 700,000 and a million roaches in one trailer, and it wasn't even the worst  trailer.  And Bill and I and his wife, Mary, sweet little thing, spent four and a half hours with abumectin  and all these toxins trying to clean this place up.  And, I mean, it was disturbing. 
[02:12:00]  It was, it's just hard to get your head around it.  You open up a drawer.  I mean, this is, you know, living in New York.  I know you guys have seen a roach.  Anthony, it must have been traumatic for you.  See, it was.  But, you know, you see one, you see two, and you go, okay, we got a problem.  You see three or four, you go, we got an infestation.  Yeah.  You see 600,000, does not compute.  Yeah, you just can't even, can't even figure it out.  Nope.  Talk about the heebie-jeebies.  Oh, yeah.  With that, the first half of the show's over.  We're really late.  They're probably cutting the show off. 
[02:12:30]  If you want, you can continue with us on XM.  I don't know how busy you are, but I'd love to.  I got a publicist.  Let's see what she says.  All right.  You know, it's up to you.  You've been a great guest.  We'd love to have you back, Mike.  It's Mike Rowe.  Shark Week starts on the Discovery Channel next week at 9 p.m.  We got to get out of here.  We'll continue on XM Satellite Radio.  Thanks for checking us out today on this fine Whip Them Out Wednesday.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons. 
[02:13:00]  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance,  and the entire stack of melons came crashing down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons,  but my melons are still juicy and perky.  Please wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony XM 202. 
[02:13:30]  The O.P. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Ah.  There we are.  They're saying rain for today in New York.  I don't see that.  No, it looks pretty good.  It looks good, but you never know in the summer with those thunderstorms rolling in.  General Bam is out here.  What is the general here for?  General Bam!  I think he's got a plug.  Thanks.  The general has a plug?  What are you guys plugging?  You guys are all going to the movies? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, we're going to movies.  Jay Moore's new movie, The Groomsman.  Independent film that he just opened up.  Thursday night, 10-15 at the City Cinema Village East, I think it is, 181 2nd Avenue.  And then we're all going out around the corner to drink afterwards.  It says 10-15 Thursday night.  Just support a friend of the show.  You know, stuff like that.  A little pest night out at the movies.  Pest night out at the movies.  It's a good movie from everything I've read about it.  So, you know, why not help out a friend of the show? 
[02:14:30]  It's actually a pest doing something good this time.  Aw.  You guys do nothing but good in our eyes.  For us, yeah.  We don't want to piss you guys off.  And you're also working on a softball game, New York vs. Boston or something?  Yeah, we're having an FBA softball game, August 20th, New York vs. Boston, barbecue.  It's up in Westchester.  So if anyone wants to, you know, sign up for that, just check out FBA.  There's a thread there for that.  And then, you know, it should be a fun time.  You're drinking, you know, girls showing their pits and, you know, how can that be bad? 
[02:15:00]  General Bam's loafers are shocked to shit.  Wow, they're comfy.  You need new loafers.  They're comfy.  You've been doing a lot of loafing.  You look like something.  I get shark week.  Look at me.  I'm nine months pregnant.  The twins.  Those shoes.  This is the pest's general.  You've been eating too many rations.  Give some to the soldiers for the love of God. 
[02:15:30]  Mike, you can make fun of them.  We all do.  This is Mike Rowe from Shark Week.  Hey, how are you, man?  I'm just saying, look, that's some fantastic bait.  Seriously.  We could use you.  We could use you.  Throw me over.  General Bam.  He's a good boy.  He's a chum.  All right, why don't we walk?  It's fullblownaids.com right there.  We take a short one, one and a half block walk over to the XM Studios.  By the way.  Yeah.  Anything you fucking want to say now can just be said because the FCC is non-applicable. 
[02:16:00]  Well, the Discovery Channel is applicable.  Yeah.  That flash is my career going before both our eyes.  Just thought if you were able to or somebody got on your nerves, maybe.  I understand.  Well, let me think.  I'm reviewing all the bad words I know.  And, yeah, I'll see if I can't work a few minutes.  Yeah, if you feel the need.  Honestly, man, if I had any idea, any suspicion that radio was this fun anymore, I mean, what  the heck?  I'm working way too hard.  We're just walking down the street.  You're getting paid.  I know.  This is just walking down the street. 
[02:16:30]  And we're getting paid.  And you just see miserable people.  Yeah, look.  You realize how miserable most of the people in this world are.  It's heartbreaking.  They're just walking to work.  See, I understood at, I think, maybe eight years old that I didn't want, like you said  during the first half of the show, that I did not want to be in a suit behind a desk.  I just knew at, like, eight years old I was not going to do that.  No way.  Well, that's the start.  I mean, oh, my God.  You know, this is.  Oh, jeez.  Jesus.  What did he say?  Oh, my God. 
[02:17:00]  What did he say?  Who knows?  There are awful listeners.  Yeah, we don't know that guy, Mike.  Oh, that would have been good.  See, we want Mike Rowe to be a friend of the show, so.  Oh, look, man.  You guys had me at hello.  Right now, I'm just trying to make some sense of the whole thing.  Yeah, why would a radio show have to walk a block and a half?  It is ridiculous, believe me.  We agree wholeheartedly.  Speaking of ridiculous, there's an advertisement for Learn English, 1-800-English.  And it's in English.  That's great.  Why not? 
[02:17:30]  It's in English.  I mean, I don't think they get many calls.  Look how happy she is, though.  She's smiling at something.  Shouldn't that be an Asian or something?  She's learned something.  Yeah, it should be in some other language, at least.  Oh, yeah.  Now, this is dangerous, man.  I like this.  We're all, we're broadcasting.  A bus is three feet from us.  You want to go this way today?  Yeah, let's go this way today.  Oh, there's always the option of which way we go.  It's exciting every day.  Now, have you guys, like, witnessed bad things happening on this walk? 
[02:18:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Tragic things?  That's what it is about the walk.  We never know what's going to happen.  Sometimes it's just a walk.  We don't do anything.  Right.  And sometimes there's fights, there have been rallies, there have been, I guess, harassment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, accidents.  On our side.  Almost, almost saw a cab driver hit somebody at the payphone over there.  That was a good one.  Sure.  We're hoping for the best.  Well, a man can dream.  And then there's usually a homeless guy sitting on that standpipe over there, but he's not there. 
[02:18:30]  What's up, bro?  How you doing?  We usually throw him a few bucks, get a few hard luck stories out of him, but he's not there.  And every day he's not there, you've got to wonder, maybe he's never coming back.  Sure, yeah, you might have seen the last one.  What's a job they wouldn't show on Discovery?  Are there any?  The what?  Is there any jobs that they said, no, we're not showing this one?  You know, I've passed on a few, but, you know, not for the reasons you're thinking. 
[02:19:00]  Just, you know, I really, the show should be fun, so I don't want to do a body farm or a crime scene.  I mean, I've done it for other things.  What about mop guy at a peep show?  We did actually get a letter with some pretty interesting pictures from a place in Amsterdam, but we haven't quite done the international thing yet.  But if we ever go that way...  Hey, that's not a bad idea, though, to take it overseas, the show.  You always hear about the, I think that's urban legend, the squeegee guy at the peep show.  Well, I think squeegee might be overstating it a bit.  Squeegee?  I mean, that's impressive, but, I mean, a mop. 
[02:19:30]  A mop, okay.  Peep shows always smell like ammonia, because they're always cleaning up in there.  Yeah.  Well, that's good.  Well, it's true, you know, the ammonia content in urine is staggering.  No, it's from the guys actually with the mops of the bucket.  Oh, the actual ammonia.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, they're always cleaning up in there.  Oh.  This is it, the wonderful Steinway building.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Yeah.  Look at that.  We just stare, and then we go inside.  Oh, I was going to...  Oh, thank God I didn't do something. 
[02:20:00]  I was going to do my fake interview thing with her.  Take it easy, gentlemen.  Bye, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you for the walk.  Thank you.  That was a quick one today.  Quick little walk.  So does this still work in the elevators?  You keep going?  We just...  Yeah, it goes as long as...  We reach the end of the hallway.  Ah.  And then they play some music.  Oh, hopefully we make it upstairs.  So basically, if I understand this, you guys get paid to rehearse.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  One day we'll get it right and retire.  This is fantastic. 
[02:20:30]  All right, we'll see you upstairs.  Ah.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of DVD.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of disease.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it. 
[02:21:00]  It's pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for power.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The O.P. and Anthony program.  The O.P. and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  O.P.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy. 
[02:21:30]  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, do it!  It's terrible.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:22:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:22:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:23:00]  All right.  Hey, look who's back.  Let's go right to the phone.  Kramer.  Hey, what's up?  How are you guys doing?  What's up?  Hey, man.  O.P., I've got to compliment you on your flub line.  Show us the area that you use the soap that your dad washes his face with. 
[02:23:30]  I've been saying it all morning.  It's fucking great.  Well, did I flub or I just stumbled through the line?  You stumbled through it.  You missed the word the right before soap.  I thought it was the area.  All right.  That's like a...  Honestly, that's like a Jay Moore bit.  And if you don't mind me being so bold, I want to give you kudos.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Later.  All right.  As we set up camp, I still haven't figured out how to set everything up and be ready to broadcast. 
[02:24:00]  Well, we're supposed to set...  Yeah, we get here.  We got things to set up.  We're supposed to set a scout.  A scout ahead to do everything.  Yeah, to get everything nice and set up for us.  A recon, man.  A recon.  Mike Rowe.  You can tell he's in studio.  Yeah.  You know, when I first got into broadcasting, I wanted a voice like Mike Rowe.  It ain't that great because it comes with the face.  And I soon realized with my horrendous Long Island accent, I was never going to sound like Mike Rowe. 
[02:24:30]  So then I decided to start thinking up fart jokes.  And you never look back.  I hate guys like you with the voice, to be honest with you.  I don't like me either.  Because that was my dream when I got into this.  I wanted to be one of those 70s boss jocks.  Boss jocks.  Sure.  Boss jocks.  Talking up records and drinking bourbon.  Smoking cigarettes without the filters.  Man, there's still time, you know? 
[02:25:00]  I mean, there's anything.  You're a young man.  You got your whole...  No, I really did try to be like, you know, like a guy in broadcasting with a voice.  That's it.  You want the voice.  But, yeah.  The movie trailer guy, his voice.  Don LaFontaine.  Yeah.  When you can't afford Don, you call me.  I'm like the B-list.  Oh, you do the movie trailers?  Oh, yeah.  For which ones?  You got that voice.  I mean, mainly independents.  I haven't done any in two years.  But from 90 to, I don't know, 94, I guess. 
[02:25:30]  I did a lot of them.  Yeah.  One man.  In a world.  You know, all that crap.  Sure.  In a world.  Yeah.  Got the pipes.  Good times.  We got the dump sheet.  All right.  Yeah.  This...  We like pointing out what was dumped out of during the FM portion.  Dump it.  So, oh, like the beeping, all that.  Yeah.  We got a guy on a button.  Yeah.  And whenever somebody says something that is not FCC compliant, it must be eliminated. 
[02:26:00]  Right.  And we got a list.  This is it?  That's it.  I thought we had a real dirty show today.  We weaved ourselves around all the stuff.  Wait.  When I said I just want to look at your snatch, that made it?  Oh, boy.  Now we could be in trouble.  Snatch?  I said snatch.  And I want to look at your snatch?  I believe that word has a much longer history as a verb than a noun.  I mean, really.  I mean, I don't know, but...  And you didn't really get graphic with what you were doing with the snatch. 
[02:26:30]  I want to look at your grab.  That makes perfect sense.  Yeah.  You know, it's just...  World's deadliest snatch on the Discovery Channel.  Snatch week.  Snatch week.  Snatch week.  Now, that would be a pay-per-view, I think.  Honey, get in here.  We put Mike in danger during Snatch week.  Snatch week.  I'll host that one.  You got a great natural deep voice.  It really is unbelievable, man.  Get in bed with the Haitian whore. 
[02:27:00]  It's snatch week.  We've all made mistakes.  Now you can, too.  Interactive.  Online.  All the time.  Oh, damn, man.  Snatch week.  Let's all just talk like this for 20 minutes.  Give it a try.  Give it a try.  Try it at home.  It's hard.  You're going to hurt yourself.  Dumps, dumps.  Yes, dumps.  Why not?  Why not? 
[02:27:30]  You want to throw me the little dump thing?  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  See, we just got Steve.  He's the closest we got.  That was his attempt.  Hold on.  Get Steve.  I want Steve to meet a real voice guy.  Where's Steve?  Where's Steve?  I know you're a big TV star with Shark Week and World's Deadliest Catch and Dirty Jobs.  Steve, you hear this guy's voice.  Yes, I have been listening to it, and I'm writing liners for him as we speak. 
[02:28:00]  I thought you were going to be in there two hours.  Steve, you've got to be honest with us.  It hurts a little, doesn't it?  Yes, my ego is bruised.  We know you have a fine voice, but look at this guy.  It's genetics.  I mean, he was born with substantially lower pipes.  And I can't compete.  Steve, you have a rich, well-modulated baritone.  Thank you, sir.  You have your voice comes with what I like to call a certain built-in credibility. 
[02:28:30]  People want to listen to you.  And, you know, I think you've got a bright, shiny future out of you.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I was going to say well-articulated horse shit, but I thank you.  In spite of your past, your future looks bright and is future.  Mike, could you say that's terrible?  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's Steve acting, by the way.  He's also an actor.  Yeah, well. 
[02:29:00]  Not a good one.  Yeah.  You're all right.  Thank you, Jim.  Here's him asking somebody what he's doing in his house.  What are you doing in my house?  Exactly.  But it gets better.  Here's him really mad asking what someone's doing in the house.  Listen to how sing-songy crap this is.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  Mike doesn't even know you.  Steve is openly laughing at you.  I know.  It's always a treat walking into the hail of gunfire that is this studio.  Oh, Steve. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, man.  He does get deep and emotional at one point, though.  Yeah.  This, he's just been told that a gentleman's parents had died.  In the sketch.  In this sketch that he did.  And he's asking how the parents died.  And listen to the drama.  Get your hanky out first.  Yeah.  I'm ready.  This is just.  How'd your parents die?  How'd your parents die?  How'd your parents die?  Do you want skimmer regular?  That's more of an emotional tug than that did. 
[02:30:00]  So it's kind of like, pass the salt.  How'd your parents die?  Exactly.  That's really what I was going for.  Trying to make it as friendly as possible and ease the tension of the person who just  suffered.  Why did I?  But not many people can do this, which is to say no in this fashion.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Not sped up or anything.  That's amazing.  You sang it and delivered it.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Indeed I did.  He was all worked up.  You got the song?  It's like, no, no, no.  You got the no, no, no song? 
[02:30:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, his theme song?  Steve's theme song.  Okay.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  This is embarrassing for him in front of Mike because it's like, this is like me being smashed  in front of Carlin.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Exactly.  There's actually a guy who's accomplished something that I would have liked to accomplish 
[02:31:00]  and he's laughing at me.  Dude, I'm laughing.  I say.  No, you're not.  Just say yes to no.  You don't know how many voiceover jobs this guy turns down on a daily basis.  Exactly.  All the stuff I'd probably say yes to.  Of course.  You wouldn't even be offered.  Stop.  No, no, no, no.  Your name's not even seen.  No, no, no.  It's Mike.  You're Mike Light.  Oh, that was hurtful.  No, no.  He's Mike Light.  That was really hurtful.  He's right there.  He's right there.  I can see him from here.  It's awkward.  I didn't mean that.  You're Mike in a helium atmosphere.  That's right.  But, dude, hey.  Your tattoos, though, are fantastic. 
[02:31:30]  Thank you, sir.  I'm a blank slate, I'm afraid.  I can't help you keep going for me.  If tattoos could get you voiceover gigs, then.  You don't need tattoos.  You have a gift.  Jim, would you mind inching just a little bit closer?  Just a little closer.  I wanted to hug you.  I'm going to give you the gift of a fist in the face, Jimmy.  Yeah, here's a tattoo.  He's still big.  I'll give you the gift of dental work.  He certainly is.  Lebanese fella.  Oh, yeah.  Indeed. 
[02:32:00]  What about your people?  Do you have any people over there?  Not that I'm aware of.  Not that I'm sure I have distant relatives there.  Not that you care about?  Not really.  I'm sure they're all blown up.  Do you want to go over there and pick up arms and fight?  Not at all.  No?  I'm enjoying the comfort and the blissful ignorance of living stateside.  Living in America.  Indeed.  All right.  What are we up to?  Dump report.  Yeah, at 6.34 a.m., a simple fuck.  The caller muttered under his breath the F word.  Fuck. 
[02:32:30]  7.08 a.m., a caller said asshole.  Yeah.  Oh, assholes.  Plural.  That was dumped out of.  And at 8.44, hey, buddy, that's my ass.  Bob Saget on the phone discussing his Penguin sex movie after saying Louis Black violated  Christina Applegate in the dark, making it clear that the violation was the ass.  So, that's why he dumped.  I like how he gives the explanation of why. 
[02:33:00]  This is remarkable, man.  So, you guys do this every day.  You can literally deconstruct your last show.  Why we were dumped.  Yeah.  Why things got dumped out of.  We find it fun because it's so stupid, the rules.  The rules, ridiculous.  Today, they're very obvious, but other days, it's like, oh, come on.  It's like, why are you protecting.  Sometimes they dump out of something because it was prefaced, like, five minutes before  in a certain way.  Right, right, right.  You could say, you know, all right, everybody, the word paper equals pussy. 
[02:33:30]  And then 10 minutes later, go, yeah, I rammed it in her paper.  They'll dump out of the word paper.  Or, it's, you know, one of those things where you can't.  It's tragic.  Do you smell, excuse me, do you smell Ben Gay?  Yeah.  You do.  It's not, you don't have anything, all right?  No, no.  That was Steve that walked in with Ben Gay on.  No, my mic smells like something.  They clean the mics every day.  I thought I smelled it when Steve walked in with you.  Dude, they're talking about Ben.  I'm addressing the message boards.  Dude, they're finally talking about him and he's gay. 
[02:34:00]  Is that why he's not on the show anymore?  Hope he said Ben was gay.  I didn't say nothing.  Ben has moved on and we wish him the best.  Yeah, that's it.  We still love the guy.  We're not happy about it.  We're not happy about it.  He should be the executive producer of the Opie and Anthony show, but he's not at this  time.  And we would love to hire him back someday.  How's that for now?  It just kind of happened.  That's the way things happen. 
[02:34:30]  It's true.  Especially in stupid radio.  His homosexuality had nothing to do with it.  Absolutely not.  Is Steve going to come back in and explain why he smells like my grandmother?  That would really bug me.  I don't know if it's him.  He probably worked out.  It had to be Steve.  I'm sure he pulled his stupid back doing something.  Any excuse to make fun of Steve.  See, the beauty of Steve is it really is like poking an animal because he really can  smash me.  What happened?  Oh, you really do.  I have a good sense of smell.  It was excellent.  Very targeted. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Very potent.  I just put it on.  I messed up my shoulder at the gym.  What did you do?  What were you doing, sweetie?  What happens to you?  I work out a lot.  I work out a lot.  So I just pulled something like right here and it hasn't healed for like a month.  What were you doing?  Shoulders?  What's the top of the shoulder?  Shoulders and biceps.  Actually, there's chest and biceps on Monday and then shoulders and back last week.  Why don't you hit the bag?  I hit the heavy bag every day.  That's great.  Four days away.  I love the bag, right?  Do you really?  But I keep jamming my pinkies.  I don't know why.  Don't do that.  Because you're a faggot.  Stop doing that. 
[02:35:30]  Stop doing that.  No, I actually don't punch it.  I actually slap at it and I yell, get away from me, Masher.  Masher.  1945.  But no, I hate it.  I do.  What do you do?  I do.  Look at me trying to.  Excuse me.  A real man.  I caught myself trying to be a man.  Talk to a real man about working out, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  I want to see it.  He jumps in the water with sharks.  I know.  And there I am.  I hit the bag sometimes.  Sometimes I have my iPod on and they call it a great shape.  And your pinky hurts.  Sometimes your pinky hurts.  I jam both.  It's funny you should say that.  I jam them both. 
[02:36:00]  I don't know why.  I don't rap.  You're hitting wrong.  I know.  I don't know how to rap.  So I bought those gloves, like little under gloves.  Yeah.  Which suck.  Yeah, like little underpants.  You have to hit harder than you think you have to hit.  What's that?  Hit harder than you think you have to.  Really?  And it won't hurt as bad.  Yeah.  And make a tighter fist than you think.  How many rounds do you do?  Just until you're exhausted.  That's right.  Until you fall down.  Until you fall down.  Steve, have you tried the Bengay on your larynx?  They're eating some.  He's way too comfortable in here. 
[02:36:30]  I've been trying to fit in.  I don't know what you're saying.  I don't know how to make it.  You're fitting in perfectly, sir.  Yeah, you're all right.  Yeah, yeah.  You're rubbing around a little.  No, I have not.  All right, listen.  Let's go to Charlie in Jersey.  Charlie, what's up?  Charlie.  Mike Rowe is the Tylenol guy.  So we've got to have Steve C. do the Tylenol commercial.  Buy Tylenol.  Grr.  Grr.  Where does this guy live?  Oh, he's going to hunt you down.  Good luck.  It's somewhere in Jersey.  Mike, can you say August?  August.  Say?  Say.  I'm working on it. 
[02:37:00]  How do you say it?  Wait, when I'm excited?  Excited.  August.  I've tried very hard to lose my regionalism.  Coming this August.  So I think I overemphasize the August in August.  Coffee.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Why are you still here, Steve?  Coffee.  Because you're just going to call me back in and kick me in the teeth again.  I'll stick around.  Look at the fuck out now.  Oh, that's his anger.  Oh, he's very angry now.  Okay.  Thank you, Steve.  My angel.  Let's go to Bob in Jersey.  Bob. 
[02:37:30]  Bob.  Hey there, Bab.  Hey, Bob.  How are you?  Welcome aboard, Bob.  Speak or be hung up on.  Listen, I just want to say hello.  Go ahead, Bob.  Hello.  Yes, Bob.  No homo.  And I think Mike's voice is going to make me cum.  Jeez.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's do it.  I think that was a compliment.  Yeah, this guy.  Yeah, you know what?  I'm going to redo my resume and I'm going to change my demo.  Thank you.  Add that in.  Hey, let's say hi to Anthony in Louisiana. 
[02:38:00]  Anthony.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Anthony.  Hey, Mike.  Mike.  This is Mike Crowe, host of Shark.  Love the show, dude.  Look, man.  Thank you.  I'm driving around south Louisiana down here and I pick up some really disgusting stuff.  Y'all need to check me out.  Tell me about your pain.  I go to these restaurants and everything that they wash down the sink drains, all the food  particles, anything you could imagine comes out in a big cesspool and I pick that up every  day.  What, if you had a business card, what exactly would it say on it?  What is your job? 
[02:38:30]  It would say grease trap service.  You clean grease traps.  My friend, I have done that and hats off to you because that's a tough road.  Grease, I mean, for people who don't know, grease in the right heat temperature.  And tell me if I'm wrong.  It's Bob, right?  Oh, yeah.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Grease, when it gets warm, smells worse than just about anything.  Worse than crap.  It smells worse than sewage.  I mean, it sours in that pit.  It's not broke all the way down. 
[02:39:00]  But I just wanted to ring in, man.  I love your show.  ONA.  Y'all doing a fabulous show.  Little Jimmy Norton.  I've been listening to you since the days when they had that, hold my hand, man.  Thank you.  All right.  Dang.  All right.  We'll see you, Andy.  Bye, fella.  Let's go to Sean in Cincinnati.  Sean.  Hey, ONA.  Party rocks.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I just wanted to talk to Mike Rowe.  I'm a wastewater treatment plant operator here in Cincinnati.  Good man.  Dealt with some pretty nasty shit.  I've watched every one of your shows. 
[02:39:30]  I just wanted to get your opinion on what you thought about, you know, the actual sludge  drying and the removal of the sludge.  And, yes, the grease does build up.  That's pretty nasty shit.  Just kind of wanted to get your opinion on, you know, I think the toughest job that you  did on 30 jobs was the railroad tie removal.  You know, I'm glad you said that, Sean, because, you know, I was telling Anthony before, a lot  of these jobs, like the ones everybody wants to talk about are the ones like you have, you 
[02:40:00]  know, dealing with crap in and out day and day because they're disgusting.  But the real ball busters are the manual labor ones.  And, like, they call them gandy dancers, these guys that fix railroad ties.  They basically just cruise around on those hand carts, fixing problems when they come  across them.  At 12, 13 hours, swinging a hammer, driving a nail.  You know, I mean, it's ridiculous.  Go ahead, man.  I never thought there was 15 steps in replacing a railroad tie. 
[02:40:30]  16.  But you worked your ass off, dude.  I did.  I just want to let you know that I really dig your show, and you're not afraid to get  in there and get your hands shitty, gritty.  It doesn't fucking matter.  You burn the tires.  I'm just totally amazed that you actually get your hands dirty and show America what it's  like for us people who make it possible for people to...  And the amazing thing, he does it for free.  I do it for free.  I don't.  No, Sean.  Look, man.  Hey, thanks. 
[02:41:00]  And the people who don't know need to know.  You know, it's guys like you, covered in crap, doing the dirty, that are holding civilization  together.  I know it.  And, you know, with a little luck, a year from now, people are going to stop you on  the road and give you flowers.  Oh, I doubt that.  But, Jimmy, happy birthday.  Thank you.  I know you guys rock.  Oh, thank you.  Let's go to Atlanta.  Greg, what's up?  Yeah, good morning, guys.  How are you?  All right, man.  All right.  This is a question, and I'm sure it's on Jimmy's mind, too.  Mike, do you have, like, a huge cock? 
[02:41:30]  Well, you know, now there are a few terms in your question that I just want to clarify.  Mike, that's not what I meant.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't say that.  When you say huge, I mean, well, let me put it like this.  We live in a relative world, so give me a frame of reference, like bigger than a bread  box, for instance, something like that.  Ian Sparks.  He's unfacable, dude.  Oh, my God.  He's a true professional.  He's even smashed with an 800-pound crab pot. 
[02:42:00]  Yes.  A crab pot.  Have a good one, guys.  Nothing faces, Mike.  Oh, God.  Did I answer the question?  Yeah, I think so.  Quite well.  Augusta.  Kevin from Augusta.  What's up?  Augusta.  What's up, boys?  Hey, I just want to say what's up to Mike Rowe.  Tell him I'm a big fan.  Cool.  And every time this Shark Week promo comes on, I tell my girlfriend to shut her mouth  and listen to the camera.  Hey, take care, boys. 
[02:42:30]  Doing a great job.  Spread the virus, guys.  They come at you with those eyes, those horrible black, lifeless eyes rolling in your head,  and they grab onto you and the screaming starts.  And it goes on and on.  It's like you can't get your hand on the remote fast enough.  It's a nightmare.  Black eyes.  Lifeless eyes.  Like a doll's eyes.  It rolled back in your head.  Oh, Christ.  What a great scene, man.  You know, he improvised that.  Really?  Did he really?  Yeah.  He, Spielberg talked about, you know, we need a story here. 
[02:43:00]  And Shaw was like, well, you know, the Indianapolis.  And Spielberg was like, tell me about it.  And he gave him the short version.  And then he said, roll tape, you know, let's go ahead and shoot it.  And out it came.  And there it was.  You know?  I mean, it's really maybe the best two minutes in the film.  Hell yeah.  You know?  And knows it word for word.  No.  No.  Not word for word.  Just about.  I used to.  Do we have it on tape anywhere?  No?  Do we have that audio? 
[02:43:30]  I'm sure.  Oh, man.  I would love to hear that.  I can't get enough of it.  You ever see the taking of Pelham 123?  He was great.  Sure.  And the subway.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Do you have the death penalty?  Pity.  Pity.  Lost him too soon.  Yeah, he was great.  And you want to give it a shot?  No, I really don't.  You were gearing up, though.  I heard a little in there.  No, I just knew the bum.  The Hiroshima bum.  Just delivered the bum.  We delivered the bum.  The Hiroshima bum.  Yeah.  No, I don't know the whole thing.  I have to watch it again.  914 men went in.  714 came out. 
[02:44:00]  Sharks got the rest.  But we delivered the bum, right?  Yeah.  And then he goes, so I look over at my friend, and he bobs out, and he's got no legs.  And I'm like, whatever.  Whatever.  And, hey, let's drink to your leg.  All right.  Your leg, too.  I don't do the voices.  Perfect delivery.  Let's go to Carl.  Another Jersey.  Jimmy does these impersonations.  You think you were listening to the real person.  You close your eyes.  You think he was the really drunk, dead British guy.  I loved him.  Some days he could function. 
[02:44:30]  Other days, you just didn't know what you were getting.  Black Sunday.  Oh, the story's from that one, too.  Oh, he's a good boy, Robert Shaw.  We only got a few more minutes with Mike.  He's got another interview to go to.  Carl in Jersey.  What's up?  Are they telling us he's got to go?  Hey, Mike.  How you doing?  He's telling us.  Good morning, man.  I love you guys.  And, Mike, you're great.  Listen, two quick questions.  Did you ever get sick from shooting a show?  And what was the worst thing you actually ever smelled?  The first question, the answer is yes.  Actually, a couple of times, but in our very first episode, I vomited on camera. 
[02:45:00]  I tried to do something in each episode that I hope hasn't been done before, and we were  making, I was with a shark biologist, in fact, in Martha's Vineyard.  We'd been out at sea for maybe six hours.  We were in what's called a following sea, you know, so the tide's behind you, and it's  just gently rocking the boat in a very even, just debilitating way.  And I hadn't been feeling well.  It was a long night the night before, and I was in the stern with a meat grinder and  a bucket of dead mackerel, and I'd been laying a chum slick for about four hours. 
[02:45:30]  And in the middle of a stand-up, I just, I threw up in a way, I don't know how best  it, let's just say spectacular.  It was all of the projectile stuff that you read about, and the fact that it happened  in the middle of a sentence.  The captain was impressed.  I was impressed.  So we kept it in the show.  It just hit you, right?  You kept it in?  It just hit me.  And remarkably, it had to be pixelated.  So not only did I throw up on camera, but I believe I threw up in a blurry, blurry vomit 
[02:46:00]  is basically what it was.  Why would they have to pixelate that?  No one knows.  Some type of offensive bodily fluid stuff.  They could show chum being ripped apart.  What's the difference?  It's just stupid lawyers.  It's, you look, you know.  Stupid lawyers.  That's great.  And the worst thing I ever smelled, it might have been a grease trap outside of a school  in Madison, Wisconsin.  They lowered me headfirst into a, down a shaft, basically, to grab a bucket of the stuff and 
[02:46:30]  bring it up so they could figure out how old it was.  It's, believe me, it's more complicated than just sucking it out.  But that was, that was memorable.  But really, I mean, that's, that's a tough question, Carl.  The short answer is, I don't know, 105 jobs, I'd say 60% of them smell bad, 20% of them  epically bad, you know.  Yeah.  I'll check my journal.  All right, one more question.  Alex in South Carolina.  Alex?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Don't call me Jim no more.  Officer, call me.  No, Alex.  Oh, hey, long time fan, long time listener.  You guys are great.  Jimmy, you're great on Lucky Louie.  Thank you, man.  I wanted to say, Mike Rowe, my girlfriend, got me into watching your show.  Never, never stopped.  She's going to freak out when I tell her that I got a chance to shout at you today.  Cool.  What's her name?  Isabel.  Tell her I said hi.  I will.  You do realize she got you into the show because she wants to bang Mike desperately and you 
[02:47:30]  kept walking in and annoying her.  Sadly enough, I do know that.  That's a scary thing and I'm glad she'll never meet Mike Rowe.  I don't know.  I don't know, Alex.  The world's smaller than people think.  You hear a deep voice coming from your bedroom.  Yeah.  Mike wants to leave chum in her hair.  The good thing about Hillman Island is there's no dirty job, so I think I'm solid.  But we just wanted to say, you know, Mike, I saw you on one of your shows and it looked 
[02:48:00]  like you were having the worst time of your life.  It was the alligator one.  That was a bad time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was kind of surprised to see you were doing Shark Week.  I was like, man, you don't like alligators.  I can't imagine you want to jump into the ocean doing sharks and all that stuff.  But I just wanted to kind of give you a shout out and say you did a great job and it's a great show.  Well, it says on the phone here, Mike looked like a pussy during alligator shows.  Yeah, he didn't want to say that.  What's up with you, Alex?  Please, it's snatch.  It didn't look like a pussy on that show. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, you know what?  I was.  What was that show?  I didn't see that one.  Alligator Wrangling, alligator farm, again, down in southern Louisiana, a place called  Cutoff, Louisiana, which lives up to its name.  But I met a guy named Jerry Savoie who has 80,000 alligators in a pretty small place.  And one of the jobs in the morning is to separate the boys from the girls.  These are five, six foot long, you know, and he literally walks in, picks them up, and  then pushes his finger deep inside their butts to determine if they have a penis or not. 
[02:49:00]  Penis, much like the penguins Bob was talking about, a lot of animals, you know, have their  business in their asses, and the only way to determine is to reach in and grope around.  Jimmy uses that technique in Chelsea at night.  The point is, you've got an alligator in your hand, you know, and you're kind of wrangling  it, and then you put your thumb in its business, and if it's a boy, you throw it one way, if  it's a girl, you throw it the other.  And it's a, you know, the guy who went in with me, I mean, I looked him square in the 
[02:49:30]  face, and I said, dude, look, I know we're making a TV show, let's not do anything really  stupid, and he said, listen, they're not going to bite us.  They almost never do.  He had a mouth like a German shepherd.  Basically, within two minutes, this guy, right next to me, his whole arm, from here  to here, like the middle of his bicep up to his forearm, I thought he took the thing off.  I mean, he bit it hard, he's bleeding, he's screaming, he's out of the pen, I'm out of  the pen.  You know, I mean, and it's just another day, you know, alligator wrangler. 
[02:50:00]  But I left that one going, nah, this is mad.  What do you think the alligator's going to do when your tickless cock go, hey, hey,  hey.  I mean, that was exactly my question.  You're brave, you touch alligator mule, you are a bold individual.  Was that the scariest job?  Or the most scared you were?  Actually, the most...  Doing this show?  There are only two that I would never do ever, ever again.  One is ostrich wrangling, and the other is catfish noodling.  Noodling is illegal in 46 states, but not Oklahoma. 
[02:50:30]  And it's basically, it's barehanded fishing.  And the way you noodle...  Why is that illegal, by the way?  A couple reasons.  Dozens of people die every year doing it.  Yeah, but if they're stupid enough to try it, screw them.  It's called unfair advantage.  You can actually catch more fish and blow through a quota noodling than you can with a rotten reel.  Really?  Yeah, but here's a short version.  You wade into a swamp or a backwater.  I've seen this.  Go ahead.  All right, I'm sorry.  I remember this now. 
[02:51:00]  All right, so you're up to your neck in this feted...  This is one of the creepiest things I've ever seen.  All right, I mean, now, in the water...  And you tried this?  Oh, I did it.  Look, there you go.  The thing bit right through my glove.  Holy shit.  Listen to this.  I saw this one.  All right, well...  Sorry that I'm so excited, but I remember going,  there's no way in hell I would ever try this.  You're up to your neck.  You're in a swamp.  You can't see your feet, nothing.  You can't see anything.  You're up to your neck in black water.  With your hands, you're groping around in the mud, and you're looking for a hole. 
[02:51:30]  If you find a hole, you stick your arm in it for the express purpose of getting bit by a catfish that you hope is in it.  This catfish can weigh between 10 and 80 pounds, and I'm not even kidding.  When the fish bites your hand, your job is to grab its lower jaw and pull the son of a gun out of there.  If you've done that, you've noodled.  That's what it's all about.  But here's the thing.  In the swamp are the following, in no particular order.  Alligator.  Alligator gar. 
[02:52:00]  And alligator gar is like the demon spawn of an alligator in an eel.  I thought it was a pirate alligator.  Gar.  No, alligator gar.  Picture a big snake with a mouth on it like an alligator.  These things are swimming everywhere.  Pretty historic.  Snapping turtles.  Cotton mouths.  Water moccasins.  They all live in the friggin' swamp.  You're in the swamp.  And these things all live on the bottom as well, and they're in holes.  So when you reach your hand in a hole, the bad news is you could get your arm taken off.  The good news is if the catfish bites you, it'll hurt like hell, but at least you'll succeed in your stupid mission. 
[02:52:30]  These guys noodle for a living.  They sell catfish on the side of the road.  They feed their families.  They feed their community.  But every day, they're in these backwaters up to their neck, groping around in the mud, hoping, hoping that their arms aren't going to get chewed off.  Why don't they just fish like everybody else and catch it?  I don't know.  You could get more by noodling.  You can get literally 10 to 1.  No, I get the heebie-jeebies in the blue waters of the Bahamas. 
[02:53:00]  Like, I look down, and I'll see, like, a minnow swim by.  Like I'm running out of crystal blue waters.  Forget about not being able to see the bottom hole in the ground.  Get out of here.  There ain't no way.  I can't even go swimming in a pool at night because I'm thinking monsters in there.  Maybe something jumped in.  A bullfrog might have jumped in, and he'll scare me.  I'll be startled.  Man, are you guys going to love Shark Week? 
[02:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Wait, so there's something that's part alligator and part eel?  Gar.  Snake gar.  G-A-R.  Yeah, look it up, man.  It's a hell of a thing.  You have to wonder who decided to fuck the other thing first.  Which one looked and went, I have to.  I need that.  Wow, that is something.  Yeah, so no.  That does sound frightening.  You'd never do that again.  No.  No, cross it off the list.  And ostrich wrangling.  You know, an ostrich can go from 0 to 50 in four steps. 
[02:54:00]  They are solid bone, 100% dinosaur.  If you shot one in the chest with a .38, it would bounce off its breastplate.  The thing's four inches thick.  I got to the ostrich farm.  An ostrich left our door open on the truck.  The thing took off, ran right into the door, tore it off the hinge.  All right?  They're cassowaries.  All right?  They're toes.  They're the only three-legged or three-toed bird there is.  Each toe is razor sharp.  It's like a raptor. 
[02:54:30]  All right?  Like from Jurassic Park.  They kick forward with 2,000 pounds of force per square inch.  They can disembowel a man like that.  I'm not even kidding.  And I wasn't kidding before when I said two, three times as many people die every year  from ostriches than from sharks.  No more ostriches.  I saw a clip on one of those Animals Gone Wild shows where some guy got hit right in  the groin and upper thigh by an ostrich leg and just ripped a gash down his thigh where  he would have bled to death. 
[02:55:00]  Zero to 50 in four steps.  Four steps, dude.  That's amazing.  Three seconds.  Four steps.  I mean, if you lift up their feathers, all right, and just like look at their legs, it's  like a cartoon drumstick.  It's this big and I'm holding my hands about two feet apart.  Yeah.  All right?  And literally, it's rippled with muscle.  They're nothing but muscle and bone.  Are you answering the cock question now or?  Yes, I am.  It's roughly the size of an ostrich leg without so much of the ripp muscle.  Are they friendly or no? 
[02:55:30]  They're too dumb to care.  They don't have emotions.  Their brains, their eyes are bigger than their brains and their heads are about the size of,  well, what Anthony was just referring to.  Now it's our staff.  He's talking.  See, we could go on forever, but we've got to get them out of here.  Yeah.  People want to know if you ever ran into a mud puppy.  A mud puppy?  Yeah.  I've made a few.  Fish with legs.  Fish with legs.  Yeah.  But the catfish thing, I saw that.  That was crazy.  That was one of the most disturbing things I've seen on TV.  I can't even imagine what goes through your head before you decide you're going to reach 
[02:56:00]  into these holes.  One of the worst moments of my grown-up life, the night before we shot that segment, we were  outside of Shawnee, Oklahoma, and I'm in a cheap motel as I always am flicking around.  And I come across PBS, and they're running a documentary on noodling, which was really  a public service announcement disguised as a doc, you know?  Do not do this.  Begging me, Anthony.  I mean, it was like they were talking just to me.  But, you know, countless interviews with mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters, all grieving  lost loved ones.  Nobody had all ten fingers.  Nobody. 
[02:56:30]  And this thing just went on and on.  So you took a chance of losing a finger when you reached into that hole?  Yeah, I did.  We see the scars.  Yeah.  I mean, I would never do it again.  But I guess we took a chance walking from one studio to the next just now, you know,  crossing wherever we did.  Risk is real.  It's everywhere, man.  You know, sometimes it looks like a fish.  Sometimes it looks like a yellow cab.  I don't know.  It's all out there.  Well, here's the thing.  Can't they just make thicker gloves?  You know, can't we just go to the market and buy the damn things and frozen food?  You know, of course. 
[02:57:00]  Dirty Jobs is about trying to get as far down the food chain as you can to see where it starts.  What are they using, deli gloves?  I mean, get the thick shark ones.  Like surgical gloves, right?  You know, there's like bragging rights.  If you're in the noodling community, they'd probably look at you like and just laugh.  The noodling community, Opie?  Community.  Dude, I'm not even kidding.  Thank you.  I mean...  It just sounds ridiculous.  If you're amongst other noodlers and you're the guy that's coming with a ski glove, I think 
[02:57:30]  you're going to get some...  You're going to get laughed at.  You're going to get a little ripping.  I'll see if I can't get the noodling newsletter sent up here for you guys.  Oh, that would be great.  It'd be big.  Hey, Mike, you've been a great guest.  I hope you come back.  You've been a great host.  Thanks for having me.  Absolutely.  Anytime.  We would love to have you back anytime.  You're not out of New York, right?  No, I'm out of nowhere.  36 states last year and four continents.  I have no home.  But if I'm in New York...  Well, make this a stop next time you're in New York, please.  Dude, I'm the kind of guy that takes that offer seriously.  So I'll see you.  Trust me, we don't offer it often.  Yeah, the people loved it.  People loved it.  Shark Week is July 30th through August 4th. 
[02:58:00]  It's on Discovery.  It's 9 o'clock.  I mean, it's probably the best week on TV, man.  Yeah.  You can't not watch it.  It's gotten huge over the years.  That's the nicest thing I've ever heard.  And then you've got Dirty Jobs and then World's Deadliest Catch, which is like your third favorite  show you do.  Dude, if I live, I'll be back here in two months.  I mean, God.  Any other shows on the horizon?  Let's see.  No, not that I know of.  I hope not.  I'm tired.  I'm doing actually a thing where I'm going down south and I'm going to noodle with my dick. 
[02:58:30]  For worms.  You know what?  We're going to have a crew follow you, man.  It's going to be great.  We're going to have a whole week named after you next.  Just love to see his face when he gets a bite.  We should do a show just cleanest jobs.  Yeah.  Me and Ann and Jimmy just going around doing the easiest and cleanest jobs.  Just sitting, drinking a daiquiri at the beach.  All right.  It's all we do all day.  Next.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, guys.  Micro, everyone.  We're going to continue in just a bit.  Thank you.  Yeah, buddy.  He's just running out to another interview and another voiceover. 
[02:59:00]  Thanks, man.  All right.  Mike?  No, no, no.  He was too good for that.  He's great.  He's great.  He's fucking with you.  Punch him in the head.  See, we're tearing down a wall today.  He does that to every guest.  And for some reason, we just...  Hey, nice work.  Oh, thanks, buddy.  Very much.  There you go.  Micro, everybody.  Give us a compliment on Lucky Louie.  That's great, dude.  That was really interesting.  What a man.  Like, it's incomprehensible to me.  If you have to noodle for a living, that's one thing. 
[02:59:30]  But to do it just for a show?  Yeah.  He makes those guys, like, you know, Steve-O.  He makes those guys.  They do a pretty rough show.  He makes them look like faggots.  Yeah.  You've got to see the noodling show.  It is the creepiest thing.  They're in these swamps.  You've got to be crazy.  They're way...  I mean, the water's up to their chest.  Oh, my God.  We're going to be noodling today, guys.  It's going to be fantastic.  I'm not going to do that.  We're going to get this real hand to do it.  Can you imagine reaching into one of these mud holes in a swamp?  Dude, you're so far ahead of where I would have bailed. 
[03:00:00]  Reaching in.  I never would set foot around the area that has a swamp like that.  The closer we came to that, and it's nowhere near.  I'm not even going to try.  But when my grandma had a house in Waiting River, they had the creeks.  Yeah.  And we go...  You used to noodle for grandma.  Yeah.  We go into the...  Dentures in your fingers.  We'll put her legs back.  Oh, God.  I feel a hole.  Go noodling.  We go deep into the creeks and get into water up to our waist to chest. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  And then dig around with our feet for clams.  For piss clams.  No, just regular.  But even that was creepy because you really don't know what's in there.  But to take it a step further like he was doing with the catfish and the holes, I can't even imagine.  I'll stick to Disney's animatronic animals and swamps.  That's all I want.  Right.  I'll light it down on my way.  If you look to the left, the hippopotamus are coming up on our boat.  Oh, no.  There's going to be a problem, Leslie.  Yes, that's okay.  Everything's going to be fine as we continue our tour. 
[03:01:00]  You'll see the alligators over here.  Alligators.  That's it.  The Jungle Cruise at Disney.  That's the closest I get to noodling.  Let's go to Kurt in Oklahoma for all day.  The most fun is when noodlers and gynecologists get together and smell each other's fingers.  Compare scars.  And the gynecologist holds his finger up and the noodler goes, yes.  Oof.  Kurt in Oklahoma.  Let's all just talk like Mike Rowe for the rest of the show. 
[03:01:30]  Kurt, how you doing?  How you doing, Kurt?  Hey, Kurt.  The noodling down here in Oklahoma is not a very popular thing.  You've got to go pretty low on the food chain, like you said.  They're straight out of the trailer.  But we've even got OklahomaNoodling.com and Oklahoma Noodling TV shows.  It's creepy.  It's gross.  Never catch a guy doing it.  OklahomaNoodling.com.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to look it up.  All right.  Let's go to Missouri and talk to Dave.  Dave, what's up? 
[03:02:00]  My boy.  Yes, Dave.  The state of Missouri just passed it a year and a half ago, the law, where it is now legal  to noodle for fun.  And it's just a sport.  A lot of these guys run around here in these ponds, the Missouri River and whatnot.  And I've seen eight and nine-year-old kids jump in the water and get it.  Pull out a 45, 50-pound flathead.  Would you noodle barehanded, sir, for a dollar?  For you, Jimmy, of course.  Oh, you're an eight.  For a dollar.  I bet a buck.  Thank you, sir. 
[03:02:30]  Christopher Lutton, who is, I bet a buck.  I bet a buck.  All right.  Noodle with your dick.  John Mayer's here?  Yeah.  I told you.  He's coming out there.  Very cool.  No, you ass.  I was, like, you know, just going with it.  I know he's here.  Oh.  Kind of my Larry literal.  Turned down a little wall.  We have no walls.  It's nice to make believe, I don't know, maybe someone just drops by. 
[03:03:00]  Like, we're that cool.  We're on a phone.  No, it was scheduled.  I know.  Well, I know.  I'm thinking maybe someone didn't tell you.  I don't think I told you.  I'm like, oh, but they didn't let you know.  I absolutely know.  I had a note and everything.  I was just like, oh, wow, you stopped by.  Thanks, Jimmy.  All right.  Just cut that out of the replay.  Everyone's embarrassed now.  Just wrecking my only job I do.  I didn't know, dude.  I was ready to say, hey, someone didn't tell you.  I was ready to cause a to-do.  A ruckus.  Well, he'll join the program next.  We got the technical virgin thing that we've played for years.  Yes.  There's a little controversy.  She's gotten a lot of trouble. 
[03:03:30]  We should have done this yesterday.  A little controversy with her.  And, you know, we got John Mayer.  Wait, let's make sure John Mayer didn't make the list.  Oh, boy.  That's a joke, actually.  Of course he's not on this list.  Okay.  I've got to make sure, though.  25 biggest voices in music.  Like, that's a joke.  He could go with that joke.  We'll continue with that list as well, okay?  All right.  This young lady's flashing her privates.  Whip them out Wednesday with Obi and Anthony.  A bunch of girls flashing their boobs, which is cool. 
[03:04:00]  Wow!  Obi and Anthony!  I want to run through the halls of high school.  I want to scream at the top of my lungs.  I just found out there's no sense that it's in the real world.  Just a lie.  Got to rise above.  Where's John Mayer?  This is the Obi and Anthony show.  John Mayer, sure?  You knew that.  All right.  What's up, John?  How are you, sir? 
[03:04:30]  I'm really good.  Is your brother a fan of the show?  Huge fan.  That's what I hear.  Jimmy tells us.  He is the host of the virus.  I met John, actually, with the Carl.  Yeah.  Really?  I got every holiday, like Thanksgiving or Christmas, I go home and it ends up moving from the kitchen  table or the dining room table to my brother, Carl, DJing, like foundrymusic.com, just playing  stuff.  Here's this one.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  It's like it's nine o'clock at night. 
[03:05:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  So he got me into it.  And then now I just listen to it in XM all the time in the car in LA.  And so, you know, I'm kind of hooked on it.  That's pretty cool, man.  Nice.  I'm kind of hooked on it.  And, you know, the thing is, is like, because we don't think we have a lot of celebrities  that listen to the show.  You still don't.  A lot of people, you know, a lot of people will say they listen, but you just know when  you're talking to them.  You know, and we got Jay Moore and we got a few that definitely listen on a regular basis,  but I don't think there's many celebrities checking us out.  You know, on first listen, you go, wow, that's pretty rough. 
[03:05:30]  That's kind of like, that's kind of like, you know, at first it reminded me of like  the lunch table that made fun of the retarded kid.  Hey, Toby, how you doing?  I'm good.  I like your new haircut.  Thank you.  And then you listen to it longer and you go like, oh, at least you guys are really  consistent, you know?  There you go.  And not, and, you know, not afraid to say like, yeah, we messed that up.  Yeah, we did mess that up that one time, you know, and, and, uh, and to learn that I  could come in and talk and then not have to worry about you guys beating the hell out  of me on the way home.  Nah.  Nah.  It'll, it'll happen here or it won't happen. 
[03:06:00]  Love it.  Yeah.  I don't think we've ever done, uh, I don't think we've ever trashed someone after they left.  Well, maybe we have.  Let me think.  Like, I think, to be honest, we probably have, but in general, we, we, we have it out right  in front of you.  Right.  If we, if we have, we'll know in a matter of a moment.  That's right.  That's right.  The listeners know more about the show than we do.  That's right.  And then they'll call us liars and why are you lying?  Yeah, you're so dumb.  Sell out liar.  The reality is we just don't remember.  And there's so few things I actually want to do on my own.  And I'm just about to enter into contract with, you know, you know, the, the, the big 
[03:06:30]  guys again and go out on, on, on the road and do radio shows with sitting across people  I don't really want to be sitting across from all the time that I have literally like four  days left before I go into rehearsals and then hit the tour.  So I'm, I'm kind of like clearing out the rest of the stuff that I really want to do  before I can't do it for two years, you know?  Two years?  Yeah.  Fuck.  You got to give it up to be out.  You know what, you know what the worst part about it is, is that I know I'm going to  end up liking it again and liking it just means getting so numb to everything else around  you that you just, there's no growth in it whatsoever. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  There's no great.  You just get so numb.  You just numb out and you just, you just subsist on like DVD series, you know, and you're  the same, you're the same person coming out of it as you are going into it.  Yeah.  You're absolutely the same.  I don't hate it.  I just, I just know that in the last couple of years I've, I've, I've, I've  picked up some other stuff I love doing and I know that I'm going to have to give  it, like I know that I'll be a zombie in, oh, two weeks into the road.  Not as, not as zombie like not loving what I'm doing, but I'm, your life just closes in 
[03:07:30]  to, it just gets really narrow.  You can't be able to be able to do on the road.  You can't do, I mean.  Like you said, you're into some things that you know you just can't do on the road.  Oh, I, you know, I don't know.  I mean, just, you know, waking up in your house and grilling, you know?  Grilling naked.  You know what I mean?  Just like, you know, deciding to do whatever you want to, you know, go shopping or whatever.  Your life becomes very encapsulated.  And it's, and that's great.  You're pretty much.  I just know that I'm just going to numb out so hard.  And then the thing is too, is like, if you want to go anywhere, oh, wet platinum.  Thanks. 
[03:08:00]  If you want to go anywhere, um, you have to rely on some like punk 21 year old kid to  drive you around.  And I swear to God, if I die, it's at the hands, it's going to be at the hands of a 21  year old runner who does it.  You know what I mean?  Like where's the nearest guitar center?  It's about an hour and a half out.  Oh, you know what?  You bring it up.  We're not on the level of you, but, uh, remember the time I went to W.  YSP in Philly and they had that kid, the runner, like to drive about a hundred miles  an hour.  They're animals.  I am going to, I will not drive with runners anymore. 
[03:08:30]  What the hell is his name?  This guy was a huge fan and was so excited to drive us back to, I don't even remember.  And they kind of want to show off for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were at OzFest and they had to go all the way across town in Philly there.  And, uh, this guy was going like a hundred miles an hour.  And they want to look at you the whole time.  They keep their heads turned away from the road.  And they like act like they just found out now that they're driving you.  So they, they do that whole like clean off of the seat, like, like, like a bowling alley.  The arm comes.  Oh, sorry.  Let me get you there.  Boom.  And then you get, you get to know every intimate detail of their life. 
[03:09:00]  Cause they won't shut their phone off.  No, I'm driving mayor.  I'm driving mayor.  He's right here.  Blue, blue pants.  You know, shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  You ever forget what city you're in or just don't know.  Cause every day you're in a different city.  No, no, it's really easy.  It's written on the top of the set.  It says, we are in on stage, but I mean, and all of a sudden you're, you're waking up  going, you know, it doesn't really have to do with the city.  It has to do with like the, the, the procession of like, uh, you know, like the bus to the 
[03:09:30]  hotel room, to the bus, to the venue.  It's really fun.  And it's, I, I think what I'm saying is here's the best analogy for it.  You know, like in the movies where people have Alzheimer's, like they stop having Alzheimer's  for a second and they like tell people they love them because they know they're about  to have Alzheimer's again.  It's like, I know that I'm about to relapse into Alzheimer's and never call anybody or  have any contact with the world.  I have what they call a moment of clarity.  That's right.  You go, oh, and then, you know, there's always the part.  I saw that chick flick too. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  It was a Nicholas Sparks novel.  How big are the venues?  What was the name of that movie?  Was it The Notebook?  I dated a girl one time.  Second, second date, she decided to bring The Notebook over to watch.  That's what he's referring to.  What a nightmare.  Yeah.  It's a little bit like that.  I saw that too.  And it's a little bit like Folks with Tom Selleck and Don Amici.  Oh yeah, that's an old one.  That's an old one.  You should have laughed all the way through The Notebook though.  When she's trying to be moving, you should have just pointed and fucking just yelled irrelevant.  What a, what a, what a, what a relationship stopper that was. 
[03:10:30]  Second Night, The Notebook.  Because it's about true love.  We should have referenced Awakenings.  Was it Awakenings?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Robin Williams.  Flowers and Danone.  So, yeah.  Another one of those kind of things.  So I, I, I'm aware that I'm about to get stupid.  How, dude, how big are the venues?  These ones we're doing, they're like 20, 20,000 maybe for the summertime?  A couple of people.  20,000.  I'm, you know, well I've been doing the Comedy Cellar.  That's a, that's a hundred and that's worse.  That's harder.  What do you mean you're doing the, you're doing comedy? 
[03:11:00]  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  That's how, that's how Jimmy and I kind of.  I had no idea.  How do you like doing comedy?  Yeah.  Uh, I, I, I actually love it.  I, everyone around me, I can't find a single person to endorse it for my career.  Oh, shit.  It's, it's terrible for your career.  Absolutely terrible.  You know, like I've done such a good job of like toeing the line and playing music and  not going to clubs and bars and keeping kind of my juice card intact and then I just go  kill it.  Like singularly just kill it night after night at the Comedy Cellar just trying, I just love  it on a writing level, you know? 
[03:11:30]  I mean, it's like just a, a weird chromosome away from spoken word, you know?  Mm-hmm.  And then, uh.  Do you tell more like stories or are you?  I'm just still at a point where I'm trying to figure out my voice, you know?  I mean, Jimmy was there on the night.  I was, I thought it was terrible.  I didn't see the set actually.  I was, it was a Friday night.  I remember that.  Yeah.  Which was a mistake for me to do it Friday night.  You know, Fridays at the Cellar can be brutal.  Which I didn't know.  My greatest nights, I'm lucky enough to know a lot of these guys and I love seeing them  just bomb.  No, I really do.  Because I also see Jimmy, like, I tell the, I tell the story all the time. 
[03:12:00]  It's, it's not, uh, I used to like, you know, go with Jimmy when he was doing his  sets in the city.  And, uh, where were we?  Stand Up New York, I think, maybe?  Stand Up New York.  Jimmy does his set.  Ten minutes kills.  I mean, he can't do no wrong whatsoever.  They're loving him.  Almost a standing ovation on a lousy Tuesday night with a couple hundred people in the joint.  We go across town to Dangerfields.  He does the exact same set.  Oh, yeah.  Exact.  Not a laugh to be had.  I was with Jay, your buddy Jay from Framingham.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember that.  I wish I never started, though.  And that amazed me, I'm like, wow, what these guys have to go through. 
[03:12:30]  Because it wasn't like, oh, something changed on the car ride across town.  Right.  It was the exact same set.  But, Jimmy, isn't it like a, like a, like a masochistic thing?  You know what I mean?  Like, you do it, and I wish I never started it.  Because once you start, you have to have the last word.  And the last word is the perfect set.  Like, I could stop after the perfect set.  The perfect set is never, I'm never going to get it.  No, because something else will happen, and you'll go, fuck, I got to talk about that.  Totally.  And so, look, I mean, where I am in my musical career is a certain kind of an orbit that I'm 
[03:13:00]  so happy and blessed to be at a point where, you know, it's working on its own.  I can kind of, I don't have my hands bracing the house of cards.  It's like, it's going now.  But it's really, it would be really boring to be 28 and not do some other stuff, you know?  So I just love the idea.  I just got whipped so hard by press.  Some kid blogged, well, I did the Friday night, some kid blogged, like, well, here's what  John Mayer had to say.  And he just put all the setups in there, and they weren't right. 
[03:13:30]  And, I mean, who has ever come back from a comedy club and correctly, verbatim dictated  what somebody's comedy act was?  Made it as funny as the comic did.  Thank you.  I'm glad I didn't have to go.  You know?  What a prick.  Terrible.  It's good to know you're bothered by blogs and message boards.  Yeah, but this one was like John Mayer said all in your slots, and, you know, John Mayer  said, you know, use the N-word a bunch of times, which I did not use the N-word a bunch  of times, you know?  So that was a rough day, but I swore it off and then woke up the next day and said, I  got to go back. 
[03:14:00]  So why not do it?  So when you're on the road, are you, like, sneaking out to do some open mics and things  like that?  I think I'm going to now.  You should.  I think I'm going to now.  It's so good for your writing, you know?  Neil Brennan, I was talking to Neil Brennan, and he was saying, that was Dave Chappelle's co-writer,  and he was saying, you know, it's just once you do stand-up, you'll be better at everything  else you do in entertainment.  And I don't like the idea of stealing jobs from people.  Like, I'm a musician, and if I ever, I can't see myself being an actor, but if I'm ever  an actor, I want to at least be able to say, well, you know, I did stand-up. 
[03:14:30]  I paid my dues.  You don't want to slide right in and steal.  No, it's weird.  A lot of comedians that are just great on a stage, they want to be rock stars.  This is the first time I'm hearing a rock star wants to be a comedian.  Because, like, Sam Kinison went down that road, Dice did a little bit of that, Bill  Hicks even tried to do a little bit of that.  Because we want to upgrade in Pussy.  That's what, you see, comedians want to upgrade to rock star Pussy.  There's nothing mayor can do.  A mayor wants to bang up, he wants to bang a fat chick. 
[03:15:00]  Dude, he wants a fatty.  He wants a fatty.  Who's that Jessica girl?  Jessica Gibson.  That's my, that's now my, that's like my inverse Jessica Simpson.  The question I have, though, is any other guys in music, you know, go to comedy?  They don't go to comedy because I'm, I just, I don't know if it's balls or just, but they  want to.  This is the first I'm hearing.  No, but they actually want to.  You know what they do that's a big mistake and that was my mistake starting out is that 
[03:15:30]  they still do it inside their musical set.  And people just don't want, you ever go see a, I mean, I did it for a long time so I can,  I can bring it out, you know, like, or bring it up, I should say.  Like, you go see people play and they, in between their songs they do these, like, aren't  I cute?  Aren't I funny?  I'm tuning up my guitar.  So I'm looking down at my tuner.  I'm going, do, do, do, do, and you're talking about some bullshit, you know, and it's just  not fun.  It's, that's not the right context for it because you do some, I would do some big joke and  people would die laughing.  And then I'd go into some sad song and it just wouldn't, it doesn't, doesn't crossfade 
[03:16:00]  right, you know?  So I don't know.  I mean, it's, I love writing.  So it's like the crack cocaine of writing, you know?  And it's also like, you only want to hear things in your voice as a, like, if you're  a singer, the people who go to see John, all right, well, I want to hear it in this  vibe.  They're not going to accept it because he's got a darker sense of humor, man, which is  great to see, like, you know, from this to that.  Right.  But they're only going to want to hear it in that one nice.  Yeah.  And, and, and also any, and I'm just starting to figure out anybody can go on stage and  come up with points.  Like you can go on stage anytime you want and say, I was thinking about how weird that 
[03:16:30]  was, but if you can't convert it into comedy speak, it, it sucks.  Yeah.  You know?  And so my first time I got up there, I went, here's some stuff I was thinking about.  And there were no punchline.  There was nothing.  It's called alternative comedy.  Yeah.  It was a whole movement dedicated to a bunch of fucking idiots with little round glasses  who don't know how to make it funny.  So you grow up low.  Where does Zach Galifianakis fall in alternative comedy for you guys?  I think Zach is funny.  Like, it's like, he is, he's alternative, but I think he's got like lines that are funny 
[03:17:00]  lines.  He's got funny lines.  Yeah.  Because I grew up with a clipboard, which is alternative, but then his lines are really  funny.  Yeah.  And I don't even mind them reading off paper.  If they're coming up, like I've seen Colin read off paper, you know, that fucking, but  it's great stuff.  It's like, I don't mind great stuff.  Right.  Someone like, uh, Brian Regan can take the most, the, the dumbest little thing, uh, that  you would say, yeah, Hey, how about toasting those pop tarts or something, you know?  Right.  And make it fucking hysterical.  Well, that's another thing too, is I don't have a hysterical, I don't have the hysterical 
[03:17:30]  kind of patina.  I just don't, you know what I mean?  So it's going to have to be really kind of thought driven, you know?  So, so, but I've been doing that just for liability.  You ever think, uh, props?  You know, I thought about one time putting a microphone inside a giant prosthetic fist,  you know, you know, the, you know, the fist, you know, the big, you know, yeah.  He's like, no, it's yours.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, and I smuggle them.  LOL.  Tie six of them together like, like rounds and Rambo. 
[03:18:00]  Hey, we've got a few guys that want to say hi here.  Uh, Mark in Connecticut.  What's up?  Hey, John.  Uh, I'm going, uh, actually I graduated.  I graduated from Brian McMahon and I just was calling up because, uh, I wanted to see  how you felt to know that girls orgasm over the fact that they have your catcher in the  rye book still.  My catcher in the rye book?  Yeah.  Did I have a catcher in the rye book?  Back in McMahon.  That's what, your name's in it.  Oh, really?  I signed it.  Yeah.  I like your item.  So now, now, now it's all waterlogged?  No, actually they've been taking good care of it. 
[03:18:30]  They won't give it back.  Who are these girls?  A bunch of, a bunch of girls?  Yeah.  A bunch of high school girls.  They, they won't give it back.  A bunch of high school girls?  Yeah.  Were they high school girls or are they still high school girls?  No, they graduated in, uh, 2005.  How long ago?  2005.  Jimmy, write it down.  Yeah, really?  I didn't realize the effect he had on women until we were at the cellar one night and a  couple of girls came over swooning for pictures.  I'm like, oh yeah.  But let it, but, but let the record reflect that I got up and left.  I, you know, I, I, you know, I don't run out with everyone. 
[03:19:00]  No, I was actually, I was actually disappointed.  He just like, took the photo.  He was very friendly.  And then sat back down and talked to me in dumb charade.  I'm like, dude, what are you doing?  These chicks love you.  He's like, ah, you know, they're nice.  Look, it's always hell.  It always ends up being a situation where you said, I should have rubbed.  Should have had a rub.  Rubbing is the answer.  It is the answer to all problems.  The rub.  Jeez, that DVD's $80.  Rub.  Let's go to Clay in Louisiana.  A lot of calls from Louisiana today.  Hey, Clay.  Uh, Mayor, my wife is a huge fan, man. 
[03:19:30]  And, uh.  You know what that means?  I think you suck.  But when someone says my wife is a huge fan.  My wife is a huge fan.  It says it means you do nothing for me.  I hate you.  I love one.  Yo, my wife loves your stuff.  And I have to listen to her fucking talk about you all the time.  No, I was in New Orleans at the Government Mule Show at Jazz Fest.  And you came on stage with Galactic.  That's right.  You were raw.  Thank you.  Freaking raw.  You know what?  Here's the thing.  Part of, like, part of having a stigma as a pop musician means it's so easy and kind 
[03:20:00]  of fun sometimes to just smash it in front of people.  So, to go up and do, like, a full-on Jazz Fest, like, jam band set and be able to pull  it off.  All I have to do is not be a complete douchebag.  And people are like, it's cool that I thought.  Yeah, you don't have to set the bar that high, man.  I don't.  The bar is so low.  All I have to do is not, oh, look at that building.  I'll get a pen.  I want to write.  There's a song there.  This is, like, all I have to do.  Let's go to Sean in Jersey.  Sean.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Don.  What's up, buddy, man?  How you doing?  You've got to be the most underrated guitar player. 
[03:20:30]  You're like the White Hendrix of today.  Dude, I love these chicks.  They scream at these songs.  They play simple songs.  And as soon as you go on, like, to a riff and just start, like, just little licks.  Shuts them up fast, doesn't it?  Thanks, man.  Well, White Hendrix, I appreciate the boldness of the statement.  I'm going to take the gesture of what you're saying and not exactly the specifics of it.  Yeah, I was thinking that, too.  I don't want anybody hearing me go, thanks, dude.  Appreciate that.  White Hendrix. 
[03:21:00]  I appreciate the boldness of that.  We finally got the girls calling in.  You're like Hendrix without any of the soul put into it.  That's right.  A white Hendrix.  You're like Hendrix with an L.A. office.  Let's go to Michelle.  Michelle?  Hi, it's Rochelle.  Okay.  Hi, Rochelle.  Ah, Rochelle.  Hi, Rochelle.  That means you have CDs at home just with an M crossed out.  Every time someone autographs to you, there's an R over the M.  Oh, Michelle?  Oh, sorry.  I mean, she's a little ghetto.  That's all right.  Keep writing.  You got a little ghetto, right? 
[03:21:30]  Rochelle?  No, no, no.  So you're calling in because you're a Lucky Louie fan?  Of course, dude.  Of course.  I don't miss any of it.  I'm not a creep.  No, I wanted to say hi to John and tell him I picked up the John Mayer Trio.  Say it.  Say it.  And I totally dig it.  We'll use it in second person, not third person.  I'm right here.  Yeah, say hi to John.  Oh, hi, John.  Hi.  You're actually on.  You're not with the screeners anymore.  I know.  Okay.  Thank you.  It is funny. 
[03:22:00]  I just wanted to call John and tell him that.  But you're talking to him.  Hey, Jimmy, will you tell Rochelle that I said thanks very much?  John is very appreciative of your compliment.  He'd prefer you don't contact him again.  Do you call up like your mom and just go, yeah, I just wanted to tell my mom that I'm  going to come over later today?  Hey, first time calling.  Give me a break.  Do you call your mom Rochelle's mom?  Gets it wrong.  Michelle.  Do you call her? 
[03:22:30]  Could you tell Rochelle's mom that Rochelle's dad has been doing things that he shouldn't?  No.  Poor Rochelle is calling and has probably been waiting on the line for a long time to give  me a compliment.  I'm just berating her.  I know.  No, she's telling me that you got the trio record, which is a labor of love that I made,  which is kind of like my Syriana after my Batman forever.  Very good.  You know?  Which I appreciate completely.  Was there something else you wanted to tell me slash subpoena me?  I just wanted to know if you were going to be at the Jazz Fest this year.  No.  When is Jazz Fest this year? 
[03:23:00]  I'm not sure yet.  Well, great.  We're doing well.  All right, listen.  We're real logistical geniuses, you and I together.  Thank you.  This next call, I mean, we got to call you out on this one.  Dennis in Philly.  We'll explain in a second.  Dennis, go.  Yo, John, all I got to say is I'm a bass player from Philly.  Love the trio stuff.  Thank you.  I got to say, the fact that you played the Pensbury prom was one of the most heartfelt  things I've ever seen a rock star do.  Thank you.  I played a prom a couple years ago. 
[03:23:30]  There was this high school kid who was a class president, the most, he was so persuasive  and aggressive in getting me out there, and he would just keep writing these letters.  I mean, he's going to be a politician someday, and he just kept saying, come on out, come  on out.  And I just figured, like, let's go do it.  And I guess they had written this book about their high school.  I mean, are you still on, Dennis?  Yeah.  Yes, I am.  Well, I mean, I'm probably not telling you.  It's no big deal.  Marsha Brady did it with Davy Jones.  Right. 
[03:24:00]  I mean, going to the prom, but it was kind of fun.  It was kind of fun to go play the prom for a minute, because high school kids, they don't  get that.  That's like Beverly Hills 90210 stuff, like playing the Peach Pit all of a sudden, you  know?  So to go play the prom, it was really cool.  And then we went to IHOP, and then we had Norgie.  Yeah, that's the best part.  Because this guy's like, he's such a great guy, because he did that.  And I'm thinking, well, if it was an old age home, are you doing the same thing?  That's right.  Yeah.  You're going to play the old folk.  No, it was cool.  We really had to twist your arm to play a prom. 
[03:24:30]  Well, this prom is actually...  You're going to play a mental institution.  It's a legendary prom, because I guess everything from the way they arrive to the planet, they  have a parade before the prom.  Oh, wow.  So basically, this is one of those school systems that has a satire class.  You know what I mean?  They probably have a wicker class and stuff like that.  Wicker.  You know what I mean?  Where's Queensbury?  Is that Canada?  Matt?  No, that's in upstate New York.  It's up by Saratoga.  Oh, okay.  Wow, I had no idea. 
[03:25:00]  Up where there's like 18 miles between exits?  Yeah, pretty much.  I love it.  I love that.  It's only two exits up.  I love that.  Where do you live?  I live by the adult bookstore.  No, but where do you live?  That's just where I hang out.  That's right.  Well, yeah, I just wanted to call in for John.  My girlfriend slash fiance, she's a big fan.  I love it.  Doesn't like you.  He's like, I'm a Tool fan, but I'm calling on behalf of her.  No, actually, I do think you're a great guitar player.  Actually, she's still a Tool fan if she's a fan.  But anyway, she's a huge fan.  She thinks you're hilarious, too. 
[03:25:30]  So the comedy thing, if you did a show for her, I'm sure you'd get a lot of laughs.  But right now, she's mad at me.  So I was wondering if you could tell her to stop being a bitch to me on the air.  If I can get some sweet, wistful music quickly as a bed.  You want some buttery beats?  If you give me some.  No, I want something a little bit like.  Maybe you get the buttery beats.  Like Delilah.  Yeah, her name is Mia.  And we're sorry.  Remember Delilah?  You ever hear that woman, she's syndicated?  Oh, never mind.  Oh, Delilah. 
[03:26:00]  Yes, I do know, actually.  Thank you.  With a soft voice, but she was a, that is a house.  I'm sure.  Only someone that sweet could be.  This is Delilah.  What was her thing?  Was it sex advice?  No, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was thinly veiled spiritual advice.  It was just like feel good kind of like, and we're sorry your dog died.  And here's R. Kelly, I believe.  That's right.  Okay.  Yes, I remember her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think she's syndicated to like a thousand stations.  Yeah.  Jeez.  She's huge.  The joke is, the joke is staling by the, joke is getting staler by the minute if you 
[03:26:30]  don't have music.  All right, we got some mom.  I have no clue.  We got something for John?  Give him a buttery beat.  Give me a buttery beat.  Me and her name is?  It ain't going to work.  No, you got to be soft.  Oh, big buttery beat.  Hey, John.  Suck ass.  Wait, wait, wait.  What is a buttery beat?  Like a break beat?  Like a James Brown fucking seems to know.  All right, listen.  You don't have your body as a Wonderland you can play in the background?  I will, that would be, that would make me vomit on my balls.  Are you really sick of some of the old stuff?  No, I wouldn't say sick of it. 
[03:27:00]  You had some massive hits.  I wouldn't say sick of it.  Listen, I play guitar too, and I used to play, to piss her off, I'd play that song on my guitar,  but I'd sing, your boobies are a bouncy house.  And it would take away all the sentiment.  She used to get really mad at me.  Well, you know what?  No one ever thought to change the lyrics to your body as a Wonderland.  That's a first.  You know, I mean, no, I'm really glad I wrote all that stuff, and even if I don't get that  much out of it, anytime you have a song or anything you do where you can watch other  people watch you do it, and it's more about their response than it is, I mean, I can historically 
[03:27:30]  kind of go back into it, but I don't...  All right, we're going to go old school for you.  All right.  So I'll do something with this.  What are we doing, by the way?  I just wanted him to tell my girlfriend to stop being a bitch to me and not just off  ass.  Well, it sounds like, based on what you just said, that you're a real articulate dude and  a real man.  I see no reason why you should have ended up in the doghouse.  What's your name?  Her name is Mia.  What's your name?  My name is Matt.  Matt.  Yeah.  And go.  Hey, Mia.  It's John Mayer on behalf of Matt. 
[03:28:00]  You know, guys are crazy creatures.  Creatures of habit.  Sometimes we do the wrong thing.  And in this case, Matt just pulled over at a rest stop.  Hurts.  Did what he had to do.  He's a power bottom.  But his heart is versatile.  Meaning, he can love you, and he can also love Exit 22.  Because of that, please take him back.  After good hosing down on the roof. 
[03:28:30]  He's your man.  Remember that.  I had him.  Strong.  Six and a half is the answer.  Take him back, bitch.  Hopefully that was helpful, sir.  Thank you.  That was sweet.  How deep is your love?  Thumb.  That was so sweet.  Thanks, John.  Sir, if you ever need any help and John's not here, I'll be happy to give a message to me.  I bet you would, Damien. 
[03:29:00]  Yes.  In Morse code.  It'll be quick.  Fucking hell.  Oh, man.  I've now officially messed everything up with my manager.  I said, oh, no, I'm going on.  I represent the company.  Right.  Sony Music, Globotech, Dow Chemical, whatever.  And I just messed it up with that one whole thing.  It's great to hear.  Trust me.  How many CDs do you have?  I've got two studio CDs.  I've got a couple live CDs.  And the new record coming out in September, which is like the first CD I got totally right. 
[03:29:30]  There's no dead weight on it.  Yeah.  Not dead weight, but what became dead weight.  There's nothing that will become dead weight.  It's like right from top to bottom.  You look back, like as a comedian, you look back, I know, and I'll hear jokes I did like  on my first CD, and I'm like, oh, douche.  Do you like look back on stuff and go, oh, that was primitive.  Like why I think that was good.  I look on it musically as like having updated it, but sentimentally, if you're, I know this  is going to sound kind of cheesy, but if the heart of the tune is right, I listen back  to stuff and say the heart of that song is completely wrong. 
[03:30:00]  Like the pulse of it just sucks.  Not even like the musical pulse, but just where it was coming from is just off kilter.  But I mean, I listen back to my first record and I listen to, I want to run through the  halls.  It has a certain like youth to it that I wouldn't want my records to sound like now, but I'm  also not 21.  Yeah.  You know, so as long as whatever you're doing is real for the moment, it's really hard to  not.  My second record, second record is not bulletproof, but I was so afraid of people wondering where 
[03:30:30]  I went or thinking that it was an accident or one hit wonder or a fluke.  Cause you know, like if you, if you go away for too long, you know, like Maroon 5 has  got to come back like two days ago.  You know what I mean?  And they really, they just, you just have to remind people that you're not an accident.  And so my, my second record was more like my foot back in the door saying like, no, no,  no, no, no.  I do this for a living.  And I wish I could go back and buy a little more time on that record.  But that's exactly why it took me so long to make this one is it's absolutely bulletproof.  I don't know that it's, I don't know that it's the greatest record of all time, but 
[03:31:00]  you absolutely can't knock it.  If you knock this record as a critic, if you're sitting there and you're like, you  know, his bland, namby-pamby music, it's like, well, now you just don't, now you don't like  my face.  Joel Siegel walked out after three tracks.  That's what I heard.  That's a son of a bitch.  Do the critics get to you?  No, cause, cause it's all part of, if you read enough biographies growing up, then you  know the way that the arc of the storyline goes.  So all the stuff that happens to me in my life for the most part, I go like, oh, this is  that part of that story.  Oh, this is part of the makeup of that biographies. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, this is where this goes.  That's how that goes.  When people started writing about the radio show, it used to bother us, I guess.  But now we just find it really silly and funny and entertaining.  It's weird.  I mean, it's, well, anybody who's ever written, it's more fun to write about stuff you don't  like.  You have more, you have more of a kind of palette to write about stuff.  You know, there's more funny ways to say you don't like something than to say you didn't.  Yeah, hell yeah.  You know?  Right.  And now it's like the internet and you get these people who are writing these things.  And it's really scary when I think about the next generation because they're really bright 
[03:32:00]  kids, but they're really, I don't want to say bright.  They have great vocabulary and great word kind of articulation, but they're idiots.  And so they're able to write like adults.  And so you'll read these things and you'll go like, wow, I just got nailed by this guy who  thinks I sound too much like Dave Matthews and the kid's like 14, but he's so, they're  so intelligent now because of the internet that they're so intelligent with how to put  words together.  But, and they have a forum and they have a forum.  Never a 14 year old kid's forum was a fucking bulletin board in high school or something. 
[03:32:30]  I know.  And now, you know, it's global.  I want to be color coded.  I want, I want, I want there to be like internet, social security number, ID.  You can't shake it.  Here is your name.  Here's your ID name.  If you, cause if you can plan bombings, now, if you can plan bombings, then let's, you  know, let's give everybody a name and an ID and a profile.  And I can tell that if you don't like me, the last review you wrote was on a candle on,  on, you know, crateandbarrel.com. 
[03:33:00]  Let's put it in perspective, you know, like fuck him.  He's light blue.  He's got color.  You know what I mean?  I hate the end.  Wouldn't that be great if someone said Norton sucks and you could say, oh, he's yellow.  His color is yellow.  That means he's 14 to 18 and his IQ is, you know, under 80.  Hey, uh, Chris on Long Island, what's up?  Hey guys, how's it going?  What's up?  Hey John, I have to apologize.  Um, a few years ago you did the tour with the Counting Crows.  Mm-hmm.  I left before you played your first note.  Thanks, your body is a wonderland.  I'm really sorry.  That's, that's fine. 
[03:33:30]  I mean, I...  You're apologizing for walking out?  Yeah, I didn't even give him a chance, dude.  I hated that song so much.  It was like shoved down our throats.  Yeah.  You up well.  And you know what?  And I listened to you Ron and Fears and now today, and I'm really regretting it.  You're a very cool guy.  Thank you.  You don't have to regret it.  I've been waiting for you, Al.  I heard your song on Ron and Fears a month ago.  I don't, I've walked out of stuff that I liked.  You know, I've met people that I didn't realize were cooler until I saw what they did on TV.  I mean, I, you know, I didn't not like him, but I met Bob Kelly for the first time before  Torgasm, and I thought he was hilarious. 
[03:34:00]  One of the funniest guys I ever saw on stage.  Had I met him now, after watching Torgasm, I would have been a little more like, you know,  googly-eyed, like, wow, so what about that time, you know?  And that's fine.  But you know him as just the creep that he is.  The ghoul that he is.  Did you hear the noises when he broke his leg?  Do we have those?  Oh, yeah.  I broke my leg, dude.  I broke my leg, dude.  I broke my leg, dude.  Bob called me six times yesterday and said he was coming to the cellar and he didn't come.  But listen, that's really cool that that guy just thought, you know what? 
[03:34:30]  I feel terrible now that I left.  I'm going to call.  That's really cool.  Thank you very much.  Have you seen Sabbath Live?  No.  Okay.  No.  I should have, because I've been around OzFest a couple times, because we share crews sometimes.  Really?  Led Zeppelin?  Led Zeppelin?  Led Zeppelin?  Led Zeppelin?  Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath?  For my money, Led Zeppelin.  Yeah.  Because, and I can qualify it by saying, Led Zeppelin is from a blues base. 
[03:35:00]  I'm more of a blues man than I would be kind of a straight up rock, metal.  Very good.  Although Black Sabbath is also the only stuff, you know, he's coming from a blues place too.  I mean, he's no, he's not that much further away than Jimmy Page, but I like, put it this  way, I like who Led Zeppelin was ripping off better than I like who Black Sabbath was ripping  off.  Which when you think about a band, it's really about who are they ripping off.  Not ripping off in a bad way, but Led Zeppelin ripping off Willie Dixon. 
[03:35:30]  Making better.  Ripping off.  I can tell you every song on my new record, it's ripping off something, and that's the  way it should be.  You'll never know, because it's ripped off well.  I like his new song, Nutty Train.  Nutty.  Hey, let's play the single.  Woo, woo, woo, woo, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, 
[03:36:00]  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, woo, woo, woo.  Did you want to play the Bob Kelly for him?  I mean, it sort of did, but we, I just stepped all over it.  Listen to that, idiot.  That's pain and fat stomach when combined.  Is he really throwing up, or is he just retching?  No, he's laying there.  No, but I mean, when he throws up in the studio and stuff, is he?  Oh, he's vomiting.  Oh, yeah.  He would retch, like, for a while, and then stuff comes up, yeah, like bile, or something 
[03:36:30]  from some little gland down there.  He has a weak stomach.  Bob is, I remember one time, we walked into my gym, and Bob walked, like, around, I was  at the urinal, and we turned around, and I just turned, and I showed him my cock, and  I'm like, hey, and he went, oh, oh, dude, I think I was molested.  Oh, oh.  Stupid.  How can a stomach so big be so weak?  Hey, let's play the single for you, John.  You don't have to play a single for you. 
[03:37:00]  No, no, no.  I haven't heard it yet.  Oh, all right.  What's the name of the song?  It's called Waiting on the World to Change.  Do you have it in the computer?  Because I have a CD with me.  Of course we do.  No, you have everything.  And who are you ripping off with?  Curtis Mayfield.  All right.  Ripping off Curtis Mayfield, look up a song called We're a Winner, and it's me going,  I want that too.  And that's all anybody ever did in music.  They just don't want to tell you.  God damn love it.  I want one of those.  Love the honesty.  Wait, didn't Curtis Mayfield, now he's obviously a great, great voice.  Is he the one that got paralyzed on stage?  He was paralyzed in the early 90s.  Falling light? 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  One of the greatest singers, and one of the greatest black, civil rights kind of singers.  I mean, just all that stuff is unbelievable.  And everybody's now found it, kind of the hip-hop community's kind of found it.  And by the end of next year, every single Curtis Mayfield track will be sped up on someone's  beak.  I was going to say, you're like a white Curtis Mayfield.  Thank you very much.  Do black crowds dig you at all?  Yeah.  I don't know about black crowds, but I like to think that I'm respected by the black community 
[03:38:00]  because, I'll tell you why, I am as confident in my whiteness as black people are in their  blackness.  And a lot of times, white people feel like the olive branch they're handing out is coming  over to the black vernacular, coming over to the black mannerism.  You see Carson Daly.  Remember when Carson Daly used to have Britney Spears and be like, when can the folks expect  a new record?  And then P. Diddy would come on and he'd go like, so when is the new joint drop? 
[03:38:30]  And at least I'm going to, I have been in rooms with the blackest of black people and  I'll still say like, you guys are some keen folks.  You know?  Teen folks, motherfucker.  You hear that, motherfucker?  You know what I mean?  Teen folks and shit.  God damn, he's white.  The black person white noise.  All right, we'll do some John Mayer.  We'll take a little break with John Mayer, the latest single. 
[03:39:00]  What's the name of the CD?  It's called Continuum.  September 12th, since you asked me.  Yeah, I should have done a little research.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm not even here for that.  I'm just here to do stuff I like.  We should get some of this info out there, though.  And Clerks came out Friday.  Clerks too, baby.  Clerks too.  Clerks too.  I just wanted to push that, too.  Push that, why not?  Push everything.  All right, let's check it out.  John Mayer, everyone.  One, two, one, two, three. 
[03:39:30]  Men and all my friends, we're all misunderstood.  They say we stand for nothing, and there's no way we ever could.  Now we see everything that's going wrong with the world and those who need it.  We just feel like we don't have the means to rise above and beat it. 
[03:40:00]  So we keep waiting, waiting, waiting on the world to change.  We keep on waiting, waiting, waiting on the world to change.  It's hard to beat the system when we're standing at a distance.  So we keep waiting, waiting, waiting on the world to change.  Now if we had the power to bring our neighbors home from war, 
[03:40:30]  they would have never missed a Christmas with no more ribbons on their door.  When you trust your television, what you get is what you got.  Because when they own the information, oh, they can bend it all they want.  That's why we're waiting, waiting, waiting on the world to change.  We keep on waiting, waiting, waiting on the world to change.  It's not that we don't care. 
[03:41:00]  We just know that the body is fair.  So we keep on waiting, waiting, waiting on the world to change.  We keep on waiting, waiting on the world to change. 
[03:41:30]  We're still waiting, waiting, waiting on the world to change.  We keep on waiting, waiting, waiting on the world to change. 
[03:42:00]  One day our generation is going to rule the population.  So we keep on waiting, waiting, waiting on the world to change.  Now we keep on waiting, waiting, waiting on the world to change.  We keep on waiting, waiting, waiting on the world to change.  Waiting on the world to change  Waiting on the world to change 
[03:42:30]  Waiting on the world to change  Wow, across America, true tales from the road.  Real people, real stories, real boo.  What's up, guys? It's Chris from New York.  I got my first wowing at a player show on Friday.  A big old funky pair of frisbee tits with nipples as black as producer's elbows.  Thanks, guys. Love you.  Oh, and hey, I was wowed on 95 going northbound in Fairfield County on Friday night.  And I got pictures, Polaroid pictures to prove it. 
[03:43:00]  Great thing to have that bumper sticker on.  It makes your day go a lot faster when you're on the highway.  Hi, this is Pop from Chicago.  I want to let you guys know that I saw a nice, perky set of tits.  I was in St. Louis, Missouri, sitting at a stoplight, looked over it, and there they are.  Tressed up against the window. It was beautiful.  If you get wowed, call the Opie and Anthony Wow Line, 866-WOW-ME-05.  And if you need a wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com. 
[03:43:30]  Very proud of my big tits.  Nice. I have a question.  In excess, by the way, yes. 
[03:44:00]  John Mayer, by the way.  John Mayer.  If you were a fan...  I like the song, by the way.  Thank you.  We didn't come back after the song.  The song is all right, man.  It's unbelievable.  I got to tell you, too.  It's the first, like, to my knowledge.  I know I've heard your stuff on the radio just because I live in this country.  But I didn't know.  I'm such a fucking cocooned idiot with music.  I listen to Sabbath and maybe, you know, I'm a fucking...  That was fantastic.  That was fantastic.  And the song about birds.  Don't worry, Jimmy.  They also play me in buddy booths.  Oh, all right.  I've heard that.  Nirvana, birds from Unplugged.  Yeah.  If you were... 
[03:44:30]  If...  The thing about in excess...  An illustrated book about birds?  If you were Michael Hutchins and you could somehow look down from heaven...  How pissed off would you be?  Would you be pissed off if your band carried on?  I mean, carrying on as a band, I guess, is cool, you know?  Like, that's what you do.  But, like, the contest...  Well, that was a little odd.  There's a few things that come up on the show all the time.  We talk about how these bands go on when the main members leave.  Yeah.  And it's going to come down to a point where these band names go on without any original 
[03:45:00]  members whatsoever.  And there's a few huge bands out there that are getting very close.  The Who were down to two.  Yeah.  But it was two that they could replace.  Right.  It was just the way it was.  Michael Hutchins.  I mean, he was the guy.  They maybe call it a new band?  Yeah.  When you get the guy that's the identity of the band, when he dies, you've got to change  the fuck.  But carrying on, like, you know, that's up to the band.  You go, like, well, we knew the guy.  I don't think it was, like...  Remember that one time on the bus when he said, if I ever die, hold a contest? 
[03:45:30]  Like, that's not...  You know what I mean?  You can't reference that.  I get...  Yeah.  Hold a contest.  You know what I mean?  If anything ever happens to me, like, say I strangle myself with a belt.  Just say.  I'm jerking off.  I got a belt.  Just say.  Just say.  Just for last.  I'm pulling this out of a hat.  Right.  Please hold a contest.  How about the cars going, you know, with Rundgren?  With Rundgren.  And Rick Ocasek is still alive.  At least, though, it's called the cars with Todd Rundgren. 
[03:46:00]  I think they're calling themselves the new cars or something.  The new cars with Todd Rundgren.  We're completely against it here.  Right.  Completely.  Do you know that Sabbath at one point had only Iommi?  And they were called Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi?  Because the rest of the band had left.  This was, like, in the mid-90s sometime.  Where they had this different singer, different drummer, different bass.  That comes down to who owns the name at that point.  Yep.  So now you know that's the guy who owns the name.  They're going to be franchises eventually.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, Journey goes out now with no Steve Perry.  But that dude sings just like Steve Perry.  That's what I heard.  The guy sings things that looks like him.  It's pretty incredible. 
[03:46:30]  But then you look at ACDC.  They had, you know, Van Halen had great success.  Have you ever seen ACDC Live?  No.  The most unbelievable sound I've ever heard in my life.  Just balls.  So loud.  Everywhere.  Like, most things that are loud, you only want to cover your ears because there are certain  kind of loud that's just offensive.  I've never heard loud be that just, like, thrusting.  It's unbelievable.  I saw him at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at the induction ceremony a couple years ago  when they were on with Steven Tyler. 
[03:47:00]  I saw him some years ago, and I thought my guts were going to come out of my ass.  Like, your whole body would shake.  It's unbelievable.  Hip-hop's got nothing on the subsonic bowel.  Wake up the next morning.  It's all you hear.  Yeah, and it's not the high whistle.  It's like the...  The Angus Young...  That was horrible waking up after some of those concerts.  They're like, uh...  Yeah, but you know, at least you lose your ears to something good. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  You know?  Like, there are times I'm sitting in the front row of a show or, you know, somewhere in the  middle, and I hear something, and I'm like, this is wrecking my ears.  And you know it is, yeah.  But let it be this band.  Let it be this band that's wrecking my ears.  Let it be, you know, ACDC or...  So you get into your 30s or 40s and trying to sleep at night, and all you're hearing  is...  I know.  I had that on the Trio Tour.  I had the worst hearing damage on the Trio Tour, because, I mean, we were a power trio.  So we went out, and I would come get off stage and never enjoyed a single post-show because 
[03:48:00]  I couldn't hear.  And I was so scared that it was going to stay like that.  What kind of monitors you used?  It wasn't even the...  Oh, we were using the wedges, like the straight-up stage monitors.  Oh, okay, yeah.  And it was all about...  No one's using those anymore.  Well, and we had those...  And it was all about how loud are you...  I mean, Steve Jordan pounding on the drum, and then me with my...  I mean, you had...  And you got your back line just blasting you from anywhere you turn.  Nobody in the country can match me on amps.  Nobody.  I mean, I get boners on amps.  You know, some people, I come over to my garage, let me show you my car. 
[03:48:30]  I don't know anything about cars.  I drive a hatchback.  It says Porsche on it, but it's a hatchback.  But amps and stuff, and it was all about taking it out on that tour and just dialing it  in as loud as you could possibly go.  Like, if you're doing a mob movie, you're going to smoke.  You're going to smoke a lot.  You're going to come home coughing.  You know what I mean?  I did Goodfellas 2.  I'm coughing.  I came back from a blues tour.  My ears were just wrecked.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Terrible.  That's a real way to end a conversation with an uninteresting story.  Yeah, why not?  When are you guys... 
[03:49:00]  We've done it plenty of times.  Trust me, we have.  When are you guys...  You're touring with Sheryl Crow and Ticketmaster.  When are you guys coming to New York?  Actually, really early on in the tour for the first time, which is cool.  We'll be at Jones Beach, and I think we might be doing a PNC, a Bank Arts Center, I think  the last week of August.  I would love to come to.  I think you should come out.  You should come out.  We'll give you the t-shirt gun.  There you go.  Shoot the t-shirt gun.  I don't have a t-shirt gun.  You'll be able to kill somebody without being arrested.  Now that I really want it.  What's that? 
[03:49:30]  T-shirt gun?  In the old days.  You know what a t-shirt gun is?  No.  T-shirt gun is like a...  At every sporting event.  Yeah.  They take these shirts, the free t-shirts, and they...  I don't...  They throw it into a tube.  Rubber band them really tight.  Oh, okay.  And then blammo.  There's a CO2 or something on it.  Okay, so you're not just getting the first three rows.  Yeah.  That's like...  The shirt is shaped like a can when they put it in there or something.  Yeah.  And then they just boom, bam.  Hot chick shooting into someone's head.  Right.  Let's go to Rodney.  People go nuts.  Rodney in Connecticut.  Hey, John.  Hey.  What's up, man?  I'm good. 
[03:50:00]  How you doing?  A while back, you had a little intro on your MySpace page.  Yeah.  You remember what I'm talking about?  My MySpace page is only for messing around with people because I think it's just such  a goof.  Anybody who takes their MySpace seriously, it's only a goof.  You have to goof on it.  So I've just done a bunch...  Is that what I did?  Welcome?  It was like welcome.  It was a miracle, man.  Yeah.  John Mayer's MySpace.  John Mayer's MySpace page.  What was it?  What was it like?  All dramatic.  It was this really, really like if Fabio was walking through mist, that's the music 
[03:50:30]  that I'd be playing.  And what was it?  It was just like breaking through the mist of clouds, naked, walking a rare white tiger.  Oh, no.  And then it was like, you know, you always have to have the other whisperer.  John Mayer's MySpace page.  He's beautiful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sophomore flogs.  That's not wrong.  Wow.  Turn that around.  What's this about?  Is this off your MySpace page?  I can't.  Yeah, that's right. 
[03:51:00]  Somebody, somebody.  Explain that because that's pretty funny.  Somebody on my MySpace, myspace.com slash John Mayer.  John Mayer.  If you want to browse some very good looking girls and message them and taunt them.  Do me John Mayer.  This girl, this girl wrote Do me John Mayer and she's 17 in her profile.  I looked it up.  Believe me.  It doesn't always come that easy.  She did it on her midriff.  Do me John Mayer.  Yeah.  She wrote on her midriff.  And so I wrote back on my midriff, that would be illegal.  I watched Dateline, which is now the best television on earth is How to Catch a Predator 
[03:51:30]  on Dateline.  Oh, yeah.  There's no better show.  They're on like volume 80 now.  It doesn't matter.  They realize that people are watching.  It doesn't matter.  I just love watching a grown man hand a piece of paper to another guy and say, are these  your balls?  How many friends does Mayer have?  He's got a couple hundred, Jim.  I have over 400 friends on MySpace.  I know all of them.  Thank you.  I don't know.  It's like, I don't even know. 
[03:52:00]  What is it?  781.  781 friends.  84,000.  84,000.  All right, cool.  Here's what I'm going to do.  Go to his page and post.  I'm going to put up my picture.  Me and John, the first time we met, we took a photo.  So you bet I'm going to try to get some fucking.  Do it.  I'm going to try to siphon some girls from that page.  I'll tell you what.  He and Jimmy had a competition going to see who could get more friends.  And it was like neck and neck for a while.  And then Jimmy lies like a motherfucker.  Gets on here and says, I'll send money to the people that become my friend. 
[03:52:30]  And I have been sending $500.  Shut up.  Into blue.  That's why he's doing the Comedy Cellar every night.  He subsidizes MySpace.  No, but I'm not knocking my fans.  I have great fans.  And here's the thing.  Anything I tell them that I'm into, they will be into.  And there's stuff I'm into that I want to keep for myself, like really cool brands and  clothes and like underground stuff that I don't even want to say I like because they'll  be in the front row going like, I got two.  I'm wearing the shirt too.  So, I mean, you know, once you post, they're going to be at the cellar. 
[03:53:00]  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  Just put my picture with John up.  And just try to get girls to come over and get to know me.  You might have a line of Asian girls outside the cellar at four o'clock in the afternoon.  He's horarious.  It's funny.  This one girl, her name is like John Mayer Fanatic.  She's really nice.  She'll like, on my space, she'll say hello, we chit-chat.  It's, you know, silly.  And I'm like, yeah, well, if you're ever in New York, I'll try to get you a shot with  John, meaning a photo. 
[03:53:30]  And she's like, oh, I don't know.  I don't think I'm pretty enough for him.  And I'm like, a photo.  Not in bed, you dumb bitch.  Not I'll see if I can get you a relationship with you.  They're really cool.  Get you fucked.  They're all so passionate that you have to control their zeal.  With that many friends, do you answer back?  No.  Do you have somebody that does?  I sure don't.  No, I don't answer back.  Because let me tell you something. 
[03:54:00]  It's a one-way street.  I have about 25, somewhere around 25,000 friends.  That's cute.  Do you really?  I answer people back.  33,000.  I don't answer.  33,000.  And ask Jimmy.  Ask Jimmy.  I know you answer.  Yeah.  Ask Jimmy something personal.  Yeah, but no.  Okay, what do you answer back with?  Thanks for being a fan.  Let's see if you answer back, Jimmy Norton.  I answer.  I do answer.  I answer a lot of them.  I can't get to all of them.  Is it a form?  Is it cut and paste?  Yeah.  Copy.  Send.  Copy, paste.  No, I actually don't.  A lot of times I just read.  I do read.  I don't ever delete without reading it. 
[03:54:30]  I've never deleted.  I have like 17,000 emails that I have not opened.  I can't.  I've never got to all of them.  Yeah, but what about the one?  I mean, I get ones that say, come to Philly.  I'm coming.  I know.  Yeah, I know.  There are some you can't answer.  But I don't think they expect an answer.  No.  When someone's asking you a question, though.  I do look at them, though.  You can't just go, hey, thanks for your support.  You know why I look at them sometimes?  Because I go, ooh, she's cute.  Right?  I go, look at her.  And they're always in the same look.  Like the look down, kind of George Clooney.  The eyes face look.  The angle and the chin and the kiss.  And then the big giant, I hate my face glasses that people wear now. 
[03:55:00]  I hate my face.  I put makeup on one day, and I have to keep up with the lie every day, and I don't want  to.  And then you go, like, this is amazing.  Who is she?  And you click on it, and it's almost a different person.  Yeah.  You have to, like, you have to forensically match the face.  Right.  I guess technically it is.  How many other shots did they take before they found the one?  Yeah, there's the eye shot, too, where it's just the girl's eye.  And it looks like, wow, that's a pretty eye.  Or the mirror shot.  Them in front of the mirror.  The mirror.  Like, I'm supposed to go, there's two of them. 
[03:55:30]  I can't tell.  Yeah, it's like, why is that elephant wearing a pretty girl mask?  And then there's the one that's really far away.  Oh, yeah.  There's the one.  You're a mile away, and you click on the picture to see.  Maybe there's some closer pictures.  No, no.  The only one.  Totally mile away.  Here's how you know that they're a big fatso.  When there's one picture of only their face, and every other picture is of their dogs and  of their apartment.  This is my fish.  350.  My fish.  How many times, though, and it's the sunglasses, man.  You'll walk up on a group of girls, and you'll instantly, your first gut reaction is, all 
[03:56:00]  of them are hot.  Because you can't see any features.  You see hair, and a silhouette, and those glasses.  Sunglasses.  And then all of a sudden, you start to break them down, and you go, oh, not you.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And all of a sudden, they just develop like a Polaroid picture of like, oh, as you shake  it, you're like, there is nobody redeeming.  How far I've come from two seconds ago, when I first thought I wanted every one of these  girls, and they know it.  They know it.  This is why they wear the sunglass.  They're getting bigger all the time. 
[03:56:30]  Pretty soon, it's just going to be like a burka.  Just a visor.  Like a polaroid.  I love you.  We associate sunglasses with beauty and glamour and movie stars, and then there's like a  psychological thing that when you see them, you just assume the person's either famous  or hot, and usually they're neither.  All right, the group pic in the profile's never good either.  There's always a hotter person than that.  Yeah, yeah.  Here's me and somebody, and you're like, which one is?  The kissy shot, the blowy kissy shot is always a little weird. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah.  But even me, like, I don't put press photos up on my mind.  Okay, and now that I've taken the piss out of like my fans, which is really great marketing  if you think about it.  It hasn't hurt us yet.  Yeah, you know, there's the Parrot Heads and then the John Mayer Stupid Bastards.  You know, like, artists have MySpace pages too, and there are some artist MySpace pages  I don't like because they're so corporate, and the MySpace is supposed to be really engaging,  and when you see like a band and their MySpace quote is, new album in stores now. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  It's a little, it's a promo shot.  A little pushy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So my MySpace pictures are like really me doing stuff.  Yeah, that's what you want.  And that's how you know it's the real artist and not a promo is if there's like home shots  or just hanging out with your brother or just doing something.  Yeah, it's not a phony shot.  It's just a studio publicity shot that you can pull off of Google.  Do you have to be a friend to post a comment on your page?  No.  All right.  No, you can just, I think you can just post comments.  I approve all comments.  You have to approve all comments. 
[03:58:00]  Oh, you do?  Oh, they won't all be kind.  Oh, so they are on my page if you notice.  Wait, so you don't want to have a MySpace page with any unflattering comments?  No, no.  I don't trust what content they'll put up, like pornography.  I'm afraid they're going to put up pornography or copywritten stuff, and that can get your  profile yanked.  That's all it is.  Oh, no, I'll put up actually on Pleasant Thomas.  Jim, you suck.  Believe me, those go up.  I don't ever edit them.  Oh, self-deprecating stuff goes up there.  Yeah, I'm just afraid they'll put stuff.  So if you guys send me pornography or whatever, nude stuff, I don't put it up because they  get my profile yanked.  So it don't stop sending me nude stuff.  They just won't put it up.  And I've had a couple of like really like young teen girls that ask to be friends. 
[03:58:30]  It's weird.  You got to, you know.  You got to make them friends really quickly.  Of course you do.  See where they are.  And stop sending me.  We'll look through all their friends.  I don't mind retarded photos.  There can be funny, but don't send me stuff of retarded kids.  I don't want, I have a line.  Oh, you get pictures of retarded kids?  Yeah, and it's like, I don't mean, I understand what you're doing.  It's like, but come on, dude, I am a human.  I mean, I can't put that.  Yeah, but what, did they just send pictures?  But if you think about it, like, and this has got to be weird for all three of you guys,  is you guys portray, not portray, you are, and you're spouting on a certain kind 
[03:59:00]  of thing.  But your fans want to play along.  Like, I always think about what it would be like to be like Letterman, and how people  like Letterman would want to come up, you'd try to make Letterman laugh.  Like, I would think you'd want to make Letterman laugh.  And in trying to do that, you make an absolute fool out of yourself.  So you must all the time be aware that people are trying to hit the top of the festival,  like the carnival game bell.  And sending a retarded kid in a picture is somebody's poor estimation of what Jimmy Norton 
[03:59:30]  thinks is funny.  Well, it's only because it's like, I mean, we make fun of it as an intangible thing.  As like a removed, distant thing.  But like, you know, to look at a picture of a really retarded kid, you know, it is kind  of sad.  I don't mind even a picture.  Look at our little Jimmy's gut feeling.  I don't mind a picture.  But I mean, like, when it comes to the caption, which probably makes me laugh when I read it.  Yeah.  I do actually laugh.  Some of them do.  Oh, dude, there are some funny bastards out there.  You know, I hate that guy.  It's a, does this nose ring make my ass look big?  Oh, that big double.  He sends attachments for your comments that you'd have to scroll your whole page over 
[04:00:00]  eight times sideways to see this thing.  And he sends them consistently every day.  And I've never posted one.  Really?  I approve all of his, I think, unless they're new.  They're too big.  It ruins your pay.  But how weird is it that these are just people in their house and you're talking about them  on the radio?  They're as good as famous.  Oh, yeah.  They're as good as famous.  Because it's TV now.  It's like what used to be a guy that had to be on TV to be a TV star.  Now, on the computer, you have this fame. 
[04:00:30]  People get famous.  You just have to be really good at being sarcastic now.  Yeah.  Like, you have to take a picture of somebody who's, like, taking a break from working 24-7  on a movie and then be like, look at her butt.  It's really weird.  It's really weird.  Like, a lot of those VH1 shows, I can't stand the ones where the people are sitting  down and they have, like, they should just have the word barely in front of what they  do for a living, like, barely comedian, but, like, barely actor.  Because they're sitting there, you don't know who they are.  And they sit there like they've been on thousands of things. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah.  And they're like, when J-Lo walked the red carpet in 1999.  The clip shows, yeah.  And it's just like, you're going to get back into your Ford tempo with the bullet  stickers on the fuel cap, on the fuel lid.  You're going to be like, but once those lights go out, you're back to, like, your house smells  like cat shit.  What was she thinking wearing that?  Right, right.  Because to be caught dead on the...  Lights go out.  Bush, bush.  Thanks a lot.  All right, thanks.  Lav mic comes off.  They walk out into the blaring sun of mediocrity.  You got, like, five bucks I could borrow? 
[04:01:30]  Get your fucking scale check with taxes out.  Oh, it's disgusting.  That's great.  We have to wrap up, unfortunately.  We got some things to do today.  You going to come back, John?  I would love to, man.  And any time I mess up and do stupid shit and you guys want to know about it...  And it's in the paper and call me and I'll set it straight or say...  Yeah, I messed up.  We started a nice new relationship here today.  And you guys can get Waiting on the...  That song really was...  And I'm just saying that because you hear a fucking unbelievable, man.  And it's Waiting on the World to Change is what we heard.  And you can get it on iTunes right now. 
[04:02:00]  And Continuum is released nationally on Tuesday, September the 12th.  So definitely grab that.  Can I do one thing as a sign-off?  I've always wanted to do this since I've started listening to the show.  You fucking cunt.  We have our penises.  They do all of our speaking for us.  They do all the talking for us.  Whip him out Wednesday. </pre>
