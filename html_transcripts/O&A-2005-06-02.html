<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with significant technical difficulties, specifically a severely distorted microphone.  Opie and Anthony spent a considerable time attempting to fix it,  injecting humorous commentary and tangents into the troubleshooting process.  Their discussion veered into unexpected territory, including a critique of Mark Felt's infamous photo, comparisons to Superman's TV portrayal, and speculation about a Ben Affleck film on George Reeves.  The faulty microphone remained a recurring problem throughout the show, causing escalating frustration and comedic exasperation from Anthony.  They also discussed their investment losses in the Citadel IPO, contrasting it with the Google IPO's success, and shared a humorous anecdote about Anthony’s navigation struggles with a MapQuest map in Washington, D.C., along with New York City parking woes.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a scathing response to a blog post by Jimmy "J.J." Walker criticizing the hosts' lack of morals. Opie and Anthony retaliated with harsh criticism of Walker's career and the stereotypical portrayal of Black people in *Good Times*.  They also disputed the blog's factual accuracy regarding their past stunts.  The hosts spent considerable time mocking Walker's blog, his catchphrase, and outdated references.  The show interspersed listener-submitted remixes of Bob Kelly's knee injury segment.  While Dave Muir was expected as a guest, his appearance was delayed due to a flight. The hosts briefly mentioned their recent appearance at an XM Satellite Radio event at Lincoln Center.

A BMX rider, Dave Mirra, then joined as a guest. The hosts discussed their rushed break times and eating habits.  Mirra discussed his career, early earnings, inclusion on a "50 most sexy bachelors" list (which prompted much joking), injuries (including losing his spleen), and his BMX preference over motocross.  Listener calls followed, covering Mirra's *Punk'd* appearance, his video game, and experiences with sleep paralysis and vivid dreams. The persistent microphone problems continued, interspersed with humorous commentary.  The segment concluded with further discussion of dreams, including recurring nightmares, and unusual dream scenarios shared by the hosts and Patty, a frequent caller.  A listener offered a possible explanation for nighttime erections.

The next segment heavily featured listener calls about sleep paralysis and recurring dreams, with callers detailing vivid hallucinations and the inability to move during sleep paralysis.  These often involved job-related anxieties (e.g., a trucker fearing lateness). One caller recounted a dream involving being shot and medevaced to the Addison Improv.  The show also addressed overused phrases from whackbag.com, including "the phones have exploded" and various host catchphrases. The discussion also included descriptions of sexually suggestive online images.  More bizarre dream scenarios were shared, including a "rotten corpse disco" in Miami and a prisoner who woke up still incarcerated.  Freakshow detailed his prison experiences, dreams, and his wife's incarceration for criminal sexual assault of a minor.  The recurring gag of Lady Di calling and hanging up continued. More Bob Kelly remixes played.  The segment concluded with the arrival of Ralphie May, Joey Diaz, and Laszlo (who brought audio from a 50 Cent video game) in the studio.  They discussed Ben, a staff member, and a nickname given to him by the hosts, awkward XM encounters, and a listener's complaints about commercial breaks.

A segment focused on the hosts' underwhelming Washington D.C. trip and workplace tensions, initially due to perceived favoritism, culminating in a humorous anecdote about paint found in the ladies' restroom and a discussion with a building representative (a different Bruce than anticipated).  They also discussed their neighbors, Victory Schools.  Laszlo provided a tech update, focusing on rappers creating video games, particularly 50 Cent's "Bulletproof," playing audio from an interview and discussing potential controversy. The conversation expanded to other video games (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, EverQuest), in-game marriages, and their real-life impact. Laszlo mentioned his Playboy article on video game addiction.  The conversation shifted to celebrities, particularly Britney Spears, Kevin Federline, Andrew Dice Clay, and a story about a topless Britney Spears encounter at R.J.'s (a gambler) house.  The "TV Be Gone" device was discussed, and Voss's questionable eBay Rolls Royce purchase was recounted.  Ralphie May, Joey Diaz, and Laszlo remained in studio throughout this segment.

The final segment featured Laszlo, Ralphie May, and Joey Diaz promoting their shows.  Gamefly.com, ringtones (including a "banana phone" and film/TV samples), and the hosts’ critiques of colleagues' "awful" and "gay" ringtones were discussed.  A lengthy, graphic discussion involving a woman and a dildo ensued.  Rich Voss called in, detailing his bad eBay Rolls Royce experience (mildew, hidden sauerkraut), and his attempts to recover his $1000 deposit.  The segment concluded with further offensive and crude jokes and comments.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you for listening. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm a cop, you idiot. 
[00:05:00]  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Put the fucking lotion in a basket.  Put the fucking lotion in a basket.  It gets me every time.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's cold.  That's funny.  I'm funny. 
[00:05:30]  Put the fucking lotion in a basket.  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Let me see what I sound like.  All right.  I got to mix my headphones.  See if I sound okay.  No.  Is that okay?  Oh, wow.  It's all distorted.  You're rocking.  It's distorted.  You're hot.  You're hot.  It's a little hot.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  If I get loud like this, it's all, like, distorted.  Yeah.  Totally distorted.  Hello.  You know what?  We can...  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We can never leave New York again.  I can't deal with this.  We can never leave New York again.  No.  Because every time we leave New York, there's something that happens to this studio.  It just falls apart.  This sounds horrible.  Yeah.  It's really bad.  This is awful.  This is the worst...  Son of a bitch.  The worst one yet.  Oh, God.  It's always good to try to fix things live on the show. 
[00:06:30]  Live on the show.  No.  I hear a distortion that is just...  It sounds like a transistor radio.  You're hearing it in there, too, right?  Yeah.  This is the way I talk.  I'm not yelling or anything, and it's completely distorted.  Fuck it, Doc.  All right.  Well, how's that?  It's whatever it's going to be.  How's that?  It's distorted.  How's that?  It's still distorted.  How's that?  You're not doing anything.  How's that?  Why don't we all just do our G-Man poses while they try to fix it? 
[00:07:00]  Like Deep Throat?  Yeah, Deep Throat's on the cover of the New York Post doing his G-Man pose from what,  1958 or something?  1950s.  He's got his G-Man suit on.  His G-Man hat.  With his G-Man junk in his...  Looks like he's wearing a big diaper.  I guess there's some pictures in probably every paper in the country.  It's his big 50s shot.  Deep Throat.  Yeah.  What the hell's his name there?  Felt.  Mark Felt.  He looks like a bad guy from the old Superman TV show. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll shoot you, Superman.  Well, they come running at him.  And Superman has his hands on his hips like a guy taking a piss.  Yep.  And the bullets ricochet off his chest.  That's what he looks like.  G-Man.  G-Man.  The best part of Superman, which you have brought up on many occasions, you know, they fire  all their bullets at Superman, they bounce off him, and then they have no more bullets  to fire at Superman, so they throw their gun and...  They throw the gun.  And then at that point, Superman ducks.  Yeah, that's an old hack stand-up gag.  But it is really funny when you see it. 
[00:08:00]  The guy's shooting at his chest, and then he runs out of bullets and throws the gun at  Superman.  And the actual punchline is when Superman dodges like he moves his head out of the way so the  gun doesn't hit him.  Yeah.  But he stood there and took bullets to the chest.  I think Ben Affleck or something is playing...  Yeah, they got a picture of Ben Affleck playing George Reeves.  George Reeves, the original Superman from the TV series that killed himself.  Right.  He's playing him in a movie, I guess.  Right, right, right.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  Well, there's Bob Woodward.  Is he going to have to wear those big stupid diaper pants that George Reeves wore as  Superman?  What an awful Superman costume that was.  He was wearing them up to his nipples.  They were like big old 50s swimming trunks.  Not quite the man of steel.  With no junk present?  No.  If you're going to wear pants like that, you should have a nice display for everybody.  I think they padded it or something.  Yeah, probably, right?  Alright, well, the microphone is going to drive me nuts.  This is really driving me crazy. 
[00:09:00]  It's going to be impossible for me.  I'm trying.  I'm really trying.  This is the worst this mic has ever fucking sounded.  It's horrible.  I'm going to have a problem doing a show like this.  You want to try that microphone?  It's really bad.  You want to try that microphone?  No.  Why?  Couldn't possibly be worse.  You want to try that microphone?  No, I can't sit somewhere else.  How about you sit way over there?  What's wrong with this one?  A different setting.  A different setting?  Well, this one's set to shit.  What is that one set to?  It's got to be better.  Alright, why don't you try it, Anthony?  Let me try. 
[00:09:30]  This is a, uh...  How about we do this?  You do that now.  Go ahead.  I didn't get these headphones.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  You've got to do this on the air.  Right?  Alrighty.  How's that?  I like it.  I like this.  Sounds better.  Alright, get rid of that.  Fuck this mic.  Break it.  Break it.  Don't push me, because I will.  No, break it, because then things get fixed when you break them.  A little annoyed.  You can make the headphones a little louder.  Alright, there you go. 
[00:10:00]  And then punch this up a little bit more.  No.  If you could.  No.  What?  No.  Just a little.  Alright, a little bit.  I'll give you this much.  Just a hair.  I'll give you a few.  That's better.  I'm going to give you a few dBs.  Alright.  Right above there.  That's much better.  You know something?  I would love my mic to sound like this mic every day.  If that could be done, that's wonderful.  I'm telling you, the guest mics, which you're using one of them now, and the mic  we label as Ben's mic, when Ben with Herky's and Jerky's in here, those two mics are great. 
[00:10:30]  They're booming.  And the level of me to the show in the headphones without needing a dual friggin' dial thing  like that.  Right.  It sounds fine.  Why is this mic a problem every time?  Why do I need a special headphone thing that couldn't be adjusted like this one is  right here?  That's fine.  Unbelievable.  Alright.  Your cord is going to strangle somebody though.  Good.  It's starting to strangle yourself.  Good.  I don't care.  You don't care.  You don't care, do you?  Voice sounds better now. 
[00:11:00]  Ant now sounds good.  There we go.  Alright.  It doesn't come across your face like that.  Yeah.  It looks really...  But it's left and right.  But you look stupid.  No.  You look handsome.  No.  He looks stupid.  There we go.  How's that sound?  Yeah.  Alright.  That's perfect.  And now you're not choking anybody.  Alright.  I want this mic.  It's all?  Oh my god.  It's all I've ever asked.  We're a huge, huge radio show and we have to like adjust things live on the show.  I don't get it. 
[00:11:30]  This, I cannot stress how bad this mic sounds.  It sounds worse than it ever has and this is after being fixed.  It's awful.  And everything was fine until we went to Washington.  Right.  Every time we go to Washington, something happens to the studio.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  I just don't get it.  Uh oh.  What's Hawk doing with a cord?  What's that for?  What are you doing, Hawk?  No, no.  You know something?  Don't do a thing.  No, no.  This is fine.  Are you insane?  Don't touch anything else, please. 
[00:12:00]  Do you understand that Anthony is this close to completely losing it?  Losing my mind.  And I'm going to do my best to see that he gets to that point.  You know what the thing is?  This works now.  The bubbling has stopped, but believe me, I was percolating.  I was ready to lose my mind.  I can't extend that.  Eric, just get in there and fix that thing on the list.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Just change it.  No.  Yeah, why don't you let Eric at least try?  No.  Let's see what happens.  Yeah, I mean.  I shan't.  What could it hurt?  What could it hurt?  No, I will not. 
[00:12:30]  I think I'm with Jimmy on this.  What could it hurt?  I'm not extending.  You know what would happen?  It would start crackling because the cord's wrong or something or broken.  I'd say we'd give it a try at least.  You really want me to lose my mind.  Yeah, people out there don't understand.  I mean, everyone expects me to lose it, but the best is when Anthony loses it.  I have the patience of a saint.  You really do.  But when it finally crosses the threshold, it's over.  I will beat children about the head. 
[00:13:00]  That's how angry I get.  I'm going to just adjust your DB just a little bit more here.  No, leave it alone.  It's fine.  It sounds good.  The listeners are commenting saying it sounds great.  Are you sure?  In the headphones, the mix, the show to me is perfect.  Are you sure?  No.  All right.  I'm fine now.  I'm fine now.  All right.  Well, that's how we started today's show.  That's it.  Every day we started a little differently.  Yeah.  We have lots to do here.  We've got to talk about ringtones.  We've got to talk about Anthony at the Tropicana in Atlantic City. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  We never got to that.  As far as I don't have SARS.  Most dangerous catch on Discovery.  Oh.  Hell's Kitchen.  Martini Steve with an O&A internet update.  I guess we made Forbes magazine.  I guess there's a new O&A ad.  Forbes?  Yeah.  Oh, I bought an article.  It's kind of exciting.  I mean, they're starting to write more and more articles about satellite radio and were  mentioned in just about every one of them.  I thought they were commenting on our cunning, how we got into that Citadel IPO and how it's  going to make us rich.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  That was pretty funny in the office, too.  Oh, it's just I love listening to people just crowing how Google is now up to almost  300 bucks a share.  Almost 300.  300.  And they're saying it may go up to 350.  350.  How do they know?  That's their new projection.  This happens all the time.  Someone from Wall Street goes, well, I said it was 275.  Like, you know, when the IPO first came out, I said it was going to go 275.  Now, I'm saying 350.  And then all of a sudden, boom, it just goes up like crazy.  Everyone buys.  And it shoots up. 
[00:14:30]  So now it's almost $300 a share.  Google.  This IPO, about a year ago, was it?  90 something?  Yeah.  Was it $94 a share?  Something like that.  Maybe 92.  You could get in on the ground floor.  And people were going, wow, that's pretty expensive for an IPO.  That's what I was going to say.  How many people have money out there where they could actually buy enough shares to make  it worthwhile?  A lot of people were the employees of the company, things like that.  But, you know, we got in, Opie, with Citadel. 
[00:15:00]  That's right, Anthony.  At $19 a share.  You and I, buddy.  A lot cheaper.  You and I.  And as I look, it's sitting at $11 and change.  I remember I was vacationing in Falmouth.  Falmouth.  And I had to fax paperwork back and forth to get in on the Citadel IPO.  Oh, yeah.  It was very, very important.  Phone calls.  I was taking all kinds of technology.  We're faxing things.  Faxing, phone calls.  We had to make phone calls and sign things, send them back.  Money orders.  They sent back to you. 
[00:15:30]  But it was so important that I just blew off a whole day to make sure I got in on the Citadel  IPO.  Oh, please.  You had to get in.  How then could you sit on a stock that's worth $11 and change when you bought it at $19  a share?  How would you be able to live with yourself?  Google that was $94 a share when an IPO is $19 a share.  Yeah.  Oh, you'd spend a lot of money on that one.  Right.  Holy crap.  Yeah.  At least, look, we didn't spend $94.  We only spent $19. 
[00:16:00]  Who cares we would have been sitting on stock that's worth $300 a share instead of $11?  What a mess.  What a mess.  Know what it's like, Anthony?  To put it in perspective, you have that beautiful Escalade.  Oh!  Yes, I like my Escalade.  Just imagine that I also bought an Escalade.  Right.  And just imagine that I just ran it off a bridge and jumped out just in time.  Oh, yeah.  That Escalade would be gone and all that money.  Right.  That's pretty much what the Citadel stock is.  In the drink. 
[00:16:30]  That's pretty much how much money we've lost so far.  It also wouldn't have taken you six hours to get to Washington, D.C.  Yeah, exactly.  You could have punched in something in your navigation system.  Yeah, that's the difference between you and I.  You've got that fine...  What is it called?  I don't even know what it's called.  GPS?  The navigation, yeah.  GPA?  Yes.  GPS?  GPS.  You know what my navigation system is?  Mm.  Me still with a map that I printed out from MapQuest.  Yeah.  And Steve on a cell phone. 
[00:17:00]  That's your nav system.  That's my nav system.  That's my nav system.  Make it the next left.  And the best was, I think we talked about this, but the best was Steve going, you're  two miles from the hotel.  I go, I know that, Steve.  But you're supposed to help me find the back roads.  Yeah.  Because everything is gridlocked.  And it took another two hours to get to the hotel.  Oh.  Because my navigation system stinks.  You ought to upgrade your vehicle, though.  Upgrade your vehicle.  Nah, my car is now just a city car. 
[00:17:30]  You have a problem parking in the city.  Thank God I didn't buy the Escalade.  Oh, trying to park that?  Well, besides that.  And then it would get stolen, broken into.  I had a nice car.  Mm-hmm.  I really did.  When we first got syndicated, I treated myself, got a nice car.  Yeah.  Nothing, you know, I got a Grand Cherokee, nice limited thing.  Yeah.  Now it's just a piece of crap.  Is it?  Ah, tools that have just bounced off the hood of the damn thing.  Because, you know, the work trucks park.  They don't care.  Right. 
[00:18:00]  You're not around.  Your car's just sitting there, and they got to get their tools out of the back of the truck.  That's true.  And then parallel parking.  When you're parking on the side of the road, I know my vehicle that I had the Mountaineer  when I parked it in Brooklyn.  You just leave it sitting there for a couple of days.  People backing into your bumper.  Oh, yeah.  They got to fit.  I did the same thing.  Of course.  My license plate was folded up like, it was rolled up like a yodel on my rear bumper.  It was just, you couldn't read it anymore because I'd back into the front of other vehicles.  You got to get in. 
[00:18:30]  Anthony, I have pushed cars.  Yeah.  I have pushed cars that have had their emergency brakes on.  You hear, rrrr.  I'm not even kidding because, you know, they're really picky in New York City.  If you're less than 15 feet from a fire hydrant, they're going to ticket you.  Yeah.  Even if you're 14 and a half feet away.  I mean, they break out freaking, you know, the measuring thing there.  Yep.  Bus stops now.  How much is a ticket in a bus stop?  It's over $100.  Yeah.  Well over $100 for a ticket.  So parking on the streets of New York City is very, very hard to begin with. 
[00:19:00]  And then you got these dopes that take up way too much room.  And now you're behind them and you're almost in a parking space.  You're almost in it.  Yeah.  Well, you lose it in front of me.  I got the bigger car.  Here we go.  I don't care if you got the emergency brake on.  I just push cars forward.  You're getting pushed.  Here it is.  Google IPO date, August 19th, 2004.  First trade.  Oh my God.  That's about when we got the Citadel stock, right?  Yep.  Oh, $100.  $100 a share. 
[00:19:30]  For the first trade.  That's if you didn't get in on the IPO.  You could have bought it for $100 a share.  That's a lot of money per share though.  It is.  But look at it now.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  All right, Anthony.  So where do you want to begin here today?  Oh my goodness.  There's so many things to get to in your little notebook of treats.  I know.  Well, I try to write little things, little thought starters down.  Mm-hmm.  Little thought starters.  The whole mic thing threw me.  I know. 
[00:20:00]  That always messes us up.  We just roll into something.  I'm sure people are listening to us, by the way.  Yeah.  I mean, just in general, someone on the phone line is like, shouldn't you guys be testing  the microphones before you get in there?  Well, you would think that would be the case.  Yes.  There was.  There was a test done.  People were in here testing the microphones, but I can't stress enough.  You cannot test this off the air.  It doesn't work.  They sit here going check, test, test.  Unless it's going out over the air, you don't know. 
[00:20:30]  You just don't.  You don't know what level you're going to need to make it sound good on the air if you're  just testing this.  I don't know.  But I like this mic and I want this mic.  Also, I think you brought it up yesterday.  Our food has arrived.  The eating will start now.  Let the eating commence.  Oh, my God.  Didn't we pretty much hint yesterday that it would be a good idea if we got the food  before we started broadcasting?  Yeah.  Yes, we did.  This is all the stuff that used to piss me off. 
[00:21:00]  I don't even care anymore.  I just laugh.  I just openly laugh.  Hey, Derek, are you talking to somebody through that?  Like, do you hit something and then talk?  Who's he talking to?  He's talking to me.  Oh, he's talking to you?  Yeah.  Because when you do that, my right headphone completely cuts out but I don't hear you.  Every time you're talking to Eric, what is he saying to you, Eric?  He's saying turn the messenger on so we can communicate with the other studio.  Oh.  There's all kinds of communication going on here. 
[00:21:30]  There's instant messaging going on.  High tech.  Through the headphones.  Who are these guys outside the studio?  Now there's people outside.  Who are you?  Who are they?  Who are you?  Hey, you outside the studio.  Who are you?  Got to wait for the delay to catch up.  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  He's waving.  He's waving.  All right.  All right.  You know what?  Why is it so hot in here too? 
[00:22:00]  You're hot?  Yeah, man.  I dress like it was winter like they told me it would be today.  I got a sweater on.  I got the long sleeves.  Who's Dave Mira?  The MX guy.  I know.  Oh.  All right.  So we're going to talk to him next?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We were throwing off our game with the damn microphone.  Because my mics were fixed.  Two days in the making.  All right.  When we get back, we're going to talk about Jimmy J.J. Walker.  Oh, right.  Okay.  See, we could have gotten right into that, but it completely slipped my mind because I had 
[00:22:30]  a G-Man with his junk in front of me.  Well, I've got to get to the Jimmy J.J. Walker page.  Jimmy J.J. Walker, well, he has a blog.  They all have blogs now, Anthony.  He's dissing us.  He's dissing us on his blog.  I guess he never got over the time we just prank called his talk show over and over again.  Do we have that?  We do.  I don't know if it's worth replaying.  It was funny at the time, but I don't know.  It might be appropriate.  I don't know.  I'd like to hear it again.  It's really bad, actually.  Stupid J.J.  We'll try to find the Jimmy J.J. Walker prank calls we did. 
[00:23:00]  He had this dumb talk show, and we decided one day to just prank him all day long.  All of a sudden, he figured he'd turn into some kind of conservative talk show host, thinking  it would be, you know, novel, and he's just awful.  Yeah.  Step and fetch it.  Goddamn.  Why would you do that?  I know.  Why would we want to trade barbs with the likes of a Jimmy J.J. Walker?  All right.  You know, we haven't really done any radio yet, so why don't we get right into it right  now, okay?  Jimmy J.J. Walker, J.J.'s views, and he does a little thing on his blog. 
[00:23:30]  It's titled, Absence of Morals.  Absence of Morals.  If you look at the picture, it's got a little picture of him, and it says Jimmy J.J. Walker  in the logo, but then behind his name, look at what it says.  Very subdued text.  Dino?  Dino, and then underneath, it says might.  Might.  Dino might.  He's still using his catchphrase from 1974. 
[00:24:00]  Holy mother of God, he's still using his catchphrase.  I'm kind of flattered that Jimmy J.J. Walker knows who we are.  I grew up watching good times.  Who didn't?  Being just a loser on Long Island, and now J.J. Walker's talking about us on his blog.  On his blog.  It just made, it made being black look so awful, that show.  Like, it set their race back 30 years from 1974. 
[00:24:30]  But we're the problem.  Oh my God.  This was the worst show.  Chock full of black stereotypes.  There was no getting out of the ghetto.  Just all of them were just a stereotype.  And J.J. was just the worst.  Shucking and a-jiving.  Working at the fried chicken place.  Oh.  He'd be wearing all the, like, pimp clothes coming in. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, just, just an awful, awful stereotype.  But that was okay.  And he's still capitalizing on it.  Dynamite.  People are panicking.  They don't think Jim Norton's mic is working today.  Oh, it's working.  He's eating.  He's eating.  I'm having breakfast so I can be healthy and contribute to the rest of the program.  And that way he can take over for when one of us are eating on the air.  I can't wait to get into my yummy sandwich.  It's like some kind of a thing the Apollo astronauts had to do.  Right. 
[00:25:30]  One guy's got to fly the ship.  Right.  You know, one guy's got to take a snooze.  And the other guy's got to check on the equipment or something.  Right now, I'm Michael Collins.  Right.  You're napping until they get to the moon.  Then you've got to drive the ship by yourself.  All right.  Well, here we go.  Jimmy J.J. Walker on his blog.  Absence of morals.  Glaucoma.  Glaucoma?  He tries to make an analogy.  And it's just...  It's awful.  Glaucoma is a disease that slowly takes away your eyesight without you noticing until 
[00:26:00]  it's too late.  Damn!  Damn!  Damn!  Damn!  Damn!  His career has had glaucoma since the late 70's.  Shame!  That's what is happening to the morale fiber in America.  J.J.'s talking about glaucoma again, James.  That's what is happening to the morale fiber in America.  Sorry.  Opie and Anthony, a couple of shock jocks.  Shock!  Shock!  Shock!  Shock!  Shock!  Shock!  Shock! 
[00:26:30]  Shock!  Shock!  A couple of shock jocks out of New York pushed the envelope to the limit.  As part of a contest, they broadcast a couple...  This is...  Is this a brand new blog?  I don't know.  As part of a contest, they broadcast a couple having sex at St. Patrick's Cathedral during Mass.  Wrong.  Wrong, once again.  Why is contest in capital letters and in quotes?  It was a contest.  Yeah.  It was not a wink contest.  This is a contest.  That's right, the quotes are throat clear. 
[00:27:00]  They broadcast a couple.  It's kind of like still using not only your old catchphrase, but your double-letter nickname from the show.  Yeah, Jimmy, J.J. Walker.  All right, so Robert Beretta and Blake.  Well, as part of a contest, they broadcast a couple having sex at St. Patrick's Cathedral during Mass.  First of all, it was in the vestibule, away from everyone.  It wasn't broadcast. 
[00:27:30]  We've been through it thousands of times.  I know, but we have to say it every time.  There was no broadcast of a sex act on our show, Jimmy.  Soon after, they were taken off the air.  Opie and Anthony had been fired from a Boston station for pulling another stunt.  This time, they made a false claim that Boston Mayor Tom Menino had been killed in a car crash.  Soon after, they were hired by New York radio station WNEW.  Their rating in the all-important 18- to 34-year-old demographic placed them in the top three stations in the New York market. 
[00:28:00]  But shock jocks, shock jocks, shock jocks, shock jocks, shock jocks, shock jocks, shock jocks.  Have long been a bastion, right?  Yeah.  Bastion?  Bastion?  A bad taste under the guise of First Amendment rights.  Major League ball player Darryl Kyle recently died of blocked coronary arteries at the age of 32,  leaving three young children behind.  His widow, Flynn Kyle, was invited to travel with the team during the playoffs so she could be with friends during her time of mourning.  Bo Duran of radio station KUPD in Phoenix called her at the team hotel and said, 
[00:28:30]  since she was now single and a hot chick, would she go to the game with him since she didn't have a date?  Tasteless!  Mmm.  Shock jocks from Howard Stern to Mancow have been fined by the FCC for lewd language, song parodies, racist remarks,  and even castrating a pig.  Parents wonder where their kids get this language.  All you have to do is get on a school bus or go to a schoolyard, something that parents can't imagine.  What?  What?  What? 
[00:29:00]  All you have to do is get on a school bus or go to a schoolyard, something that parents can't imagine?  What?  The Walkmans and radio gear that the kids are listening to, that's where they hear it.  Walkmans?  What year is this?  What year is he living in?  He wrote this only last week, by the way.  What kids are listening to Walkmans?  No kid is listening to Walkmans, you ass.  And radio gear.  Radio gear.  Be-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de.  Another kid's cranking a handle. 
[00:29:30]  He's got the big military walkie-talkie.  Radio gear.  Radio gear.  This guy is so out of touch.  How old is Jimmy J.J. Walker, by the way?  How'd he get his age?  Say he was 20 back then.  Let me take a look.  He's got to be in his early 50s at this point, right?  I'll go to the Internet Movie Database.  I know him I.  The Walkmans and the radio gear that the kids are listening to, that's where they hear it.  First of all, the kids are downloading a lot of stuff to their iPods, their MP3 players.  Well, it's the records.  You know, that's what it is.  You don't really see many Walkmans these days. 
[00:30:00]  There's a lot of bad language on the phonograph.  It's 58.  58.  Yeah.  He's 58 years old.  Still using it.  Jimmy J.J. Walker is pushing 60.  Wow.  He'll be 58 in just a mere three weeks or so.  June 25th.  All right.  Well, the Walkmans and radio gear, that's the kids are listening to.  That's where they hear it.  Like the single parent explosion, gay marriages, and child care centers in high schools, shock 
[00:30:30]  jocks have become part of the American fiber, also in parentheses, and capitalized.  Why did you capitalize fiber, idiot?  These are things that Americans couldn't have imagined 30 or 40 years ago.  Guess what else they couldn't have imagined 30 or 40 years ago?  You voting, stupid.  So why don't you stop hanging on selectively to the morals of a time that were not good for 
[00:31:00]  a lot of people, you idiot.  What an ass.  Wow.  Really, does he...  Back in the good old days when I'd help put out Mass's house, there wasn't no gay people.  Shut up, stupid.  I've seen his act.  It stinks.  Of course it does.  It's hack, you know, just nonsense.  I hope there's a clip somewhere someone can play.  If you want to speak, you're a performer, speak through your act. 
[00:31:30]  Just don't pull that mediocre hack shit on stage and then try to pontificate in a blog  because you're not talented enough to do it through your work.  Cosby, the same thing.  Talented enough.  Just a self-righteous ass.  Wow.  These are the things that Americans couldn't have imagined 30 or 40 years ago.  I could have had you shot.  They called me J.J. Walker.  Oh, J.J.  That's a funny name for a nigga.  What do they call you back home?  They called me Mr. Walker. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, God.  Stop blaming everything on shock jocks.  Dude, he's just trying to jumpstart some kind of a conservative thing.  That's the easiest argument in the world to just blanket everything and then blame it all on shock jocks.  Moral fiber.  Ugh.  Quiet.  Ah, brother.  Lancaster, California.  You have two teenage girls, 16 and 17 years old, with their boyfriends, kidnapped at a lover's lane at 1 o'clock in the morning. 
[00:32:30]  Thank goodness the girls are safe and the kidnapper killed, but no one ever asked, why were these teenage girls at a lover's lane spot at 1 in the morning?  And where is it so I can go and jerk off and watch them make it out?  Of course.  That's the important question, J.J.  Where are the parents?  These couples didn't go to that lover's lane spot for a Bible reading.  No.  This is normal behavior in today's society?  Ahem, ahem.  Normal behavior.  Oh, ahem.  And he capitalizes normal and behavior.  It's not a proper name, idiot. 
[00:33:00]  What a lunkhead.  I'd like to introduce my friend, Mr. Normal Behavior.  This is my other colored friend, Mr. Used-to-be-famous.  No one cares about you anymore, you blog-writing stupid ass.  Ugh.  He goes down that road?  People have been going to lover's lanes.  Oh, my God.  Since, God, happy days.  Yeah.  Inspiration point.  That's right.  Inspiration point.  Back in those days, you were caught hanging out with one of, like, Joni Cunningham.  They would have arrested you.  Just the fact that he calls it a lover's lane spot. 
[00:33:30]  What?  This old fossil, this out-of-touch ass.  Who goes to lover's lane?  David Berkowitz, baby.  The ultimate cock blocker.  Oh, J.J., you stink.  This is your 60-year-old grandfather giving you information and advice.  Hey, let's go to lover's lane, huh?  Hey, Joni.  And watch the submarine races. 
[00:34:00]  The submarine races.  I want to know when Tony Danza joined Happy Days.  Hey, huh?  Hey, let me tell you something.  I'm the Fonz.  Hey.  Lover's lane.  Oh, J.J.  He's trying to make that argument something that has been going on forever.  Forever?  Forever.  Kids getting away and getting a little action, you ass.  And the problem is, he says, I don't like the way he says the kidnappers were killed,  but no one ever asked what.  I want to know how did the kidnappers get killed? 
[00:34:30]  What happened?  Yeah, give us the story.  They kidnap a couple of chicks, and then they're dead.  Next line.  Yeah.  Well, here we go.  Who shot them?  Was it Mad Dog that shot them?  Is that what happened?  Here we go.  Here's the slug line of the whole blog coming up.  This is normal behavior in today's society?  Oh.  This is normal behavior in today's society.  It is just one of the many reasons that America has moral glaucoma.  That's where he was going with the glaucoma thing at the beginning. 
[00:35:00]  He brings it all back together.  And he capitalizes again.  Thank God.  Moral glaucoma.  Capitalized as in proper name.  Yeah.  He's another failed radio host.  I don't think he's doing radio anymore.  He tried it.  He stunk at it.  You know who I like better?  I like the Bookman Show.  Remember the...  He was the super of the building.  He would walk around and berate the Evans family.  Back when Janet Jackson was hot. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  She was good on that show.  Little Penny.  Have an iron on your back, you naughty girl.  Oh, that's right.  What, her mother abused her?  Sure did.  And then she was adopted by Wilona.  That's right.  And then she started to fuck Willis in the next show.  Oh, in the next show.  Of course.  And then who was the sister?  What was the sister's name in that?  Well, oh, Thelma, who was great.  Thelma, who was the hot black chick at the time.  Well, it was one of my greatest faux pas ever.  What happened?  That's right.  I once said that I once whacked off to Florida. 
[00:36:00]  To Florida.  On good times.  Would you want to put your dick between her neck rolls?  Those big, fat neck rolls.  I was just a kid, and I went to the stationery store in Centerport.  Same!  I made believe I was buying, like, baseball cards and a pack of gum, and then I kind of  casually went to where the card section was, looking at the cards, and then I'm kind of  peeking at the mirrors to see where the clerk was, and then the clerk decided he had to  go in the back.  I was the only one in the store. 
[00:36:30]  He finally went into the back, ran over to the Playboy section, stole the Playboy,  and Thelma was featured, not Florida.  She did Playboy?  Yeah.  Oh, my God, did she do Playboy.  I would love to see that, because I haven't seen that in, who knows, 20 years.  Oh, forget about it, though.  It's got to be 30 years.  Yeah, but between our legs.  When did that come out, in 80?  It's like J.J.'s head.  Maybe 25 years.  I was just a kid.  She was beautiful, right?  And I stole it, and I had it in the woods for months, and I used to take little trips up  to the woods, making believe I was going to the tree for it, and I took a little detour 
[00:37:00]  to my Playboy.  A little jungle fever for Opie.  I had it in plastic bags and everything.  It was like gold.  I swear to God, I couldn't have been more than 12 years old.  13, maybe.  And this thing was gold, and I constantly had it in garbage bags and stuff, and I was  trying to keep it dry as best as I could, because I was too scared of having it in the  house.  I remember she had a big, black, 70s, Earth Mama moth.  It was just a huge, yeah, thatch.  Can we find that picture? 
[00:37:30]  I would love to look at that.  I'm sure.  It would bring me right back to my childhood, because it was all about Thelma, Anthony.  But I told this story in the past, and I said, yeah, I once whacked off to Florida.  And that was like a 15-minute bit that ensued.  I think Good Times was actually a good show.  I mean, John Amos is phenomenal.  The guy's a great actor.  Oh, what an angry man.  What an angry black man he was in that show.  Great.  It was about a family struggle and whatever, a good show.  But it's like, don't all these years later come out and act like you're this moral, this 
[00:38:00]  picture of moral strength.  You've done nothing in your act.  Picture of moral strength.  Capitalize M, capitalize S.  Of course.  Either speak through your act, or shut your fucking mouth, man.  If you can't do it on stage, don't use the platform you have by being famous from a show  30 years ago to pontificate and try to jumpstart another part of your career.  It's stupid.  Yeah.  Disingenuous and irritating.  All right.  Let's go to Scott in California.  Scott, what's up?  Morning, boss.  Morning.  I got that story on those two girls that got kidnapped out there. 
[00:38:30]  It happened out here in California.  Okay.  What happened was the girls were at a campsite kind of a thing, and a guy was running from  the police, and he hopped out of his vehicle, hopped into their vehicle, and then took him  to the desert for like an hour or so, a couple hours, and then the sheriff's department surrounded  him and shot him while he was in the car, and the girls were in the back seat.  Oh, wait a minute.  But he didn't sexually assault him, right? 
[00:39:00]  No, he didn't.  He was just running from the police, and they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.  It was no lover's lane.  That guy was the J.J.  Walker idiot.  You know, they're getting rid of the lover's lanes all over America.  It's unfortunate.  Lover's lanes.  I was just having this discussion the other day.  Like, on Long Island, we have all these local beaches that were just awesome when you were  growing up, and that's where, you know, we all hung as teenagers because we couldn't  go to bars and stuff, and we would, you know, whoever had their driver's license, we'd  go down to the local beach. 
[00:39:30]  Hang out on the beach.  They stayed open all night, and you would crank tunes and, you know, sneak a few beers,  maybe a little wee.  Light a little campfire.  Yeah, actually, yeah.  Campfires and all that.  Now, man, when the sun goes down, they lock up everything.  I mean, they lock up everything.  The beaches, the parks.  You can't go anywhere now if you want a little action.  Well, the kids are crazy now, Opie.  The kids are crazy with their drugs and their Walkmans and radio gear.  It's insane.  It's part of growing up, trying to find a place where you go away and then get a little 
[00:40:00]  stink pink.  I think, you know what kind of ruined everything is lawsuits, things like that.  They have to make sure that everything's locked up and guarded and no one can get in there  because if some dopey-ass kid goes to the beach and drinks and drowns himself because he's  an asshole, all of a sudden the state gets sued for not having enough fences up and guards  and keeping idiots out of there.  And that's what we live in these days. 
[00:40:30]  So we all lose.  We can't really do anything.  We all lose because of that dumb turtle that is supposed to be swallowed up by the seagull.  The rest of us, you know, we make it to the ocean and we have fine lives, but there's  always one, always one wrecking it for everyone else.  And they sue.  And then they sue.  Does anybody know, is his blog allowed to take comments?  Hmm.  If it's a blog or is it a website?  It's a website.  Oh, it's not a blog?  It's a website?  Well, I'm sure there's an email.  Can we get him on the phone?  I would love to talk to Jimmy J.J. Walker. 
[00:41:00]  Can we get him on the phone?  Because he's a comic.  I mean, uh...  This guy has been trying to get on our show for a long time.  That's the funny part about this, by the way.  This is from J.J.'s Frequently Asked Questions.  What do you want to do?  Answer another full-time radio talk show and write a full-time political column like George  Will or Thomas Sowell.  What would the column be called?  Boring, predictable views?  He's a hack in life.  Damn it! 
[00:41:30]  I think that morally bad things are wrong.  Ah, this guy really goes out on a limb.  Let's read his column.  Yuck.  Let's get...  God almighty.  Have an original thought, douchebag.  Let's get Jimmy J.J. Walker on the phone, please.  Can we try to figure that out?  What is this, Eric?  You just handed me something.  Dynamitemail at yahoo.com.  What is that?  That's his email.  Dynamitemail at...  I heard at yahoo.com, but there's no dashes in dynamite, so it's dynamite, not dynamite.  Right, it's dynamite. 
[00:42:00]  That's not funny.  Dynamite is funny.  Dynamite could be dangerous.  Clap your hands and put one hand out to the right like an Egyptian, and one hand out to  the left like an Egyptian.  And go, dynamite.  Well, I guess if you feel like it, you could send Jimmy a little email.  Maybe Jimmy was just a little jealous because these things that he's talking about, which  he believes in, that's fine, but maybe because Pryor talked about it on stage in 1973 and  spoke through his act, and you were never quite good enough to do that. 
[00:42:30]  You know, you kind of had to do your TV show, which was a fine show, and then when you were  done, you couldn't parlay it into a great stand-up career because you're not that funny  of stand-up.  I just love these guys that take shots at us, and they define our whole radio careers  because of one, maybe two events.  I know.  That amazes me.  You guys don't have Sex for Sam in a weird font on your website behind you.  I would almost go with the argument.  If we were doing a Sex for Sam type of show every day, we might be affecting people out  there.  But we barely touch on that stuff. 
[00:43:00]  Barely.  Basically, we make people laugh on a daily basis.  That's it.  Do you know John Amos?  He's only eight years older than Jimmy Walker.  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  He was playing his father.  He's 66, John Amos?  I thought he was older, actually.  John Amos, born in 1939.  39 to the math.  60.  Wow.  Then you turn the thing in 66, I guess.  702 Houser Street.  Oh, yeah.  What?  He did the All in the Family remake. 
[00:43:30]  Hawk, do you have to look at the microphone.  No one can hear you out there in Radioland, for Christ's sake.  This is your time to shine.  Go ahead, Eric.  What happened?  Oh, I've got to turn it on.  Turn it on, Ope.  All right.  Hawk has something to say.  Go ahead.  Hawk.  John Amos did the All in the Family remake in the 80s.  702 Houser Street.  All right.  Is there any more trivia?  John Amos is black.  Stop the presses.  Oh, you're nasty, man. 
[00:44:00]  Let's go to Barry in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Listen up, man.  What about kids can't go sledding anymore because of lawsuits and shit like that on golf courses?  Oh, man.  We used to break down the fences at the Huntington Crescent Club, and we would just take over that course.  Take over the 10th hole.  Snowmobiles.  Huh?  Now they chase you on the snowmobiles.  Yeah.  It's getting ridiculous out there.  All right.  Punch it out, guys.  All right.  What about, oh, all right. 
[00:44:30]  Maybe that would somehow tie it with 702 Houser Street.  Oh.  We should take a break and get Dave in here, right?  Absolutely.  We also have, you want to play one just as a teaser?  One of the Bob Kelly things as we go to break?  Oh, yeah.  People already started us sending them in.  These are really good, man.  I love it.  We have like 10 of them already.  Who wants to explain the Bob Kelly thing?  Because, you know, I found out yesterday when we went to that dumb thing at the Lincoln Center.  That was great.  Dumb thing.  Why is Ben fucking shaking his head? 
[00:45:00]  That was a lot of fun last night, man.  I really enjoyed that.  Ben, what's wrong?  Ben.  It was great.  Why are you like bowing your head like...  I wasn't doing anything.  It was great.  All right.  It was just stupid.  Dude, I loved it.  I was always hobnob, got to know some people.  Was Jagger there?  Oh, the only celebrity was Ed Bradley.  And I got my picture with him.  Ed Bradley from 60 Minutes.  Yeah, you have to.  With his...  Ed J.J. Bradley?  Yeah.  Ed Bradley trying to look like he's a kid still with his earrings. 
[00:45:30]  My God.  Are you kidding?  Dude, give up on the earrings.  Oh, that's right.  I have seen that on TV.  With the earring.  I think I gave up on the earring thing 10 years ago.  I'm getting one, actually.  At this point.  No, you're not.  I'm getting a cross in my left ear.  Fuck you, dude.  No one's telling me nothing.  I'm getting an earring in my right earlobe.  I know they say it means you're gay, but that's why I'm doing it, because I'm not.  Right.  What?  The ultimate rebel.  Right. 
[00:46:00]  That's right.  I'm getting an earring shaped like a cock right over my tailbone.  I'm just going to dangle and bang in between my cheeks as I walk and sit.  All right.  Well, it was all right.  I mean, whatever.  There's a facility that XM just had the grand opening for at Lincoln Center, and it was pretty  amazing, to be honest with you.  I was there.  Well, me and Ant were talking, right?  We were standing by the cheese, and we remarked that the facility is a beautiful facility.  And I could have thrown you under the bus so bad yesterday. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, he lied for me to the big boss.  Did you?  Yeah, I got it.  I must have got 40 seconds with Hugh Pinero, the CEO of the company.  I felt pretty privileged.  40 seconds?  40 whole seconds.  The first time, I got seven seconds, actually, because he goes, hey, what's going on?  Nice to see you.  I got photo ops, and he ran away.  But then I cornered him again, and I got at least 40 seconds.  And at one point, he goes, Anthony here?  And I'm like, hmm.  What do you do?  I'm like, God. 
[00:47:00]  Think on your feet, Opie.  What do you do?  I'm like, damn it.  I don't hate him, so I guess I got to say yes.  Yeah, he's here.  He's over there.  And I just kind of point, and there's like, I mean, because there was a hundred people.  A crowd of people.  Hey, somewhere over there getting cheese.  Good.  Yeah.  He's at the cheese table.  Mm-hmm.  Well, when you see him, tell him I said hi, and I'd like to say hi to him.  I'm like, no problem, sir.  No problem.  I'll tell him.  Mm-hmm.  And meanwhile, I'm home.  I was miles away at home where you guys should have been.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  Well, I talked to you.  I grabbed him.  Actually, I grabbed him by the arm, and I said, what's with the mics in the New York studio?  Right.  That's the way I talked to the boss.  Of all the time and money to build this great facility here.  That's right.  Up here in the Sierra Mountains.  It was a radio business with his father.  We installed filters, and we're done game together.  Microphones.  Drinking these champagne cocktails.  All right. 
[00:48:00]  Before we take a break, so the Bob Kelly thing.  Want me to explain it?  Yeah, well, that's what I was going to say.  Someone was telling me at the XM thing that it's unbelievable how many people are coming  aboard every day.  There are people listening to us right now for the first time.  Cool.  So that's why we have to keep reiterating and making sure everyone's up to speed.  Bob Kelly's a good friend of Jim Norton's and a good friend of ours.  Does some good radio for us.  And he was on tour with Dane Cook as part of that tourgasm.  There's going to be a DVD out eventually of the whole tour. 
[00:48:30]  And basically, he broke his knee playing football.  That's the whole story.  He's kind of out of shape.  Bob is a chubby fellow with a goatee.  And he jumped up to try to be an athlete and a man for once.  And he clumsily came down on his fucking, obviously, easily shatterable little legs,  supporting all that weight.  They hadn't strengthened.  And he hurt himself.  Yes.  He broke his leg, man.  Yes.  Broke his leg, man.  Dude.  Dude, man.  I couldn't tell for the first 20 minutes of that audio what was wrong with him, though. 
[00:49:00]  I could sense something was wrong with him.  So I wasn't too sure what it was.  And the best part of the audio is when he asks for someone to hold his hand.  It's just disturbing.  And, well, the audio is up on opiananthony.com.  I don't think we need to play the audio at this point, right?  Mm-mm.  No?  Okay.  Sad.  Well, people have taken the audio, and they have already started making remixes.  A fun little feature on the Opie and Anthony show where you guys get to have fun with  some of the audio, classic audio that we have on the show, and making it into something  else.  God, you're making me jealous.  I'm so hungry right now.  What do you mean, Ant? 
[00:49:30]  I am done.  Tuna.  Time.  And Dave Muir, we're going to get to you next.  We're going to get to you next.  All right?  He's falling asleep on us.  Uh-oh.  Stay happy.  Handsome.  All right, we're going to get to him in a few seconds here.  But they're coming in.  So I haven't even heard any of these, Anthony.  None of us have, except for Steve.  Steve usually tries to give us the more interesting ones.  So we'll start with this one from Roman War Helmet from Whackbag.com.  It's Beavis and Butthead and Bob Kelly.  Hmm. 
[00:50:00]  Jim!  He's down.  You're way down.  He's down.  I snapped my knee, man.  Oh, no.  I broke my knee, man.  9-1-1, dude.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my fucking knee, man. 
[00:50:30]  I broke my knee, man.  Hey, how's it going?  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I heard it break, dude.  Really?  Fuck!  God.  I broke my knee, dude.  You dumbass.  Just leave this one flat.  Can we get him some water?  Hold my hand, man.  Do you want some water?  I've got to squeeze some.  Ah!  Don't touch me, half-wipe!  Let go, pervert! 
[00:51:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  What the fuck?  What a dork.  Fuck!  What?  I broke my fucking knee, man.  Oh, man.  It bent backwards.  God damn, man.  Look at somebody coming up.  He said, calm.  You gotta be fucking kidding me, dude. 
[00:51:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  You can't see enough of this crap.  That was cool.  No, it wasn't!  Uh, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's not bad.  Roman Warholman from whackbag.com.  Love the Beavis and Buck.  It was a damn funny show.  It certainly was.  Moral decay, though.  Good point, JJ.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  All right, we'll do one more before we go to break here.  This is from Scott from Cleveland, Anthony.  Hmm.  I haven't heard any of these.  Bill's dead.  Uh-oh.  The Bill's dead lady and Bob Kelly.  Uh-oh.  This could be good.  It has potential, right?  Well, I always like the old lady being thrown in, but it's got to work.  All right.  Well, if it sucks, just tell, you know, let's, uh, we'll stop it and we'd, uh, make fun of  it.  We'd play here.  Hi.  I broke my knee, dude.  This sucks.  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  Bobby.  I heard it break, dude. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, no.  I heard my knee break, dude.  Who is this?  That was so much pain, man.  Who is this?  I broke my fucking knee, man.  Oh, man.  It bent backwards.  Your kid.  Oh, my God.  Oh, motherfucking.  Where did this happen?  Ah, what the fuck?  Where?  Both components are funny, but put together, it's just, might as well just listen to the 
[00:53:00]  call.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Hold my hand, man.  Oh, no.  Hold my hand, man.  I got to squeeze something.  Oh, boy.  Ah, ah, ah.  We'll be sure and give the kids my key, though.  Oh, yuck.  God, that fucking hurts.  Came down with the ball.  That's all that matters.  All right, well.  That stinks, stinks, dunk.  I wish I was there so when he said, I need something to squeeze, I could have pulled out 
[00:53:30]  my mule and he could have squeezed it with his mouth.  Hand-holding sissy.  Ah, ah, ah.  Dude, just put away, get some lipstick.  Oh, I'm ready.  I want to feel pretty in the hospital.  Ah.  Well, all right.  Yeah, Bob.  We got Marvel playing for the other day.  We got, like, another 10.  Mm-hmm.  That was a good try, though.  Yeah.  When you have the different audio sources like that, you got to mask it with some music 
[00:54:00]  or something.  Or just make sense, you know?  Well, that's the first thing.  Who is this?  This?  I broke my leg, man.  Oh.  Who is this?  This?  It doesn't make sense.  I don't know.  Dundee.  And how are you supposed to hold someone's hand if you're on the phone with them?  Right.  Why would you call me all that dude?  Right.  What's up, Ben?  What are you writing down?  You're writing frantically.  Uh, Dave has a flight.  Okay, I'm sorry.  All right.  What time is that guy's flight?  We'll make sure he gets there. 
[00:54:30]  Soon.  Get your car started.  That's why he's panicking.  All right, we'll take a quick break, and we'll get Dave Muir in here.  And lots more to do on the Opie and Anthony show today.  I just love a drive in the country laughing with Opie and Anthony.  That plane is flying awfully low.  Don't you think, Ramone?  Ramone, call 9-1-1. 
[00:55:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  XM, the ONA virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:55:30]  Thank you, XM.  Thank you.  And in studio, we didn't know you had a flight, bro.  Oh, yeah.  You're just sitting out there falling asleep.  You're not on?  No, I'm on.  I'm just looking at you.  You got more food on your lips and in your teeth than I could even.  I was freaked out.  I'm looking and going, oh, my God.  You know how it is around here trying to eat?  I'm actually a very neat eater, Dave, but they only give us like 40 seconds in between breaks 
[00:56:00]  to try to get some food in us.  Ridiculous.  People are like, oh, it's cool.  You don't have commercials or don't have many commercials or whatever it is.  And it just gives us no time to piss or eat or anything.  So we take turns eating.  Usually it's like Jimmy first, then Ant, and now I'm going to attempt to eat and talk at  the same time here.  There you go.  We didn't know you had a flight.  I'm sorry.  It's all good, man.  Where are you flying to?  I got to fly back to North Carolina.  That's where you're from?  Actually from Syracuse.  I live down in North Carolina about 10 years now.  So it's good, man.  What's going on down there? 
[00:56:30]  It's decent, you know.  Yeah?  It's pretty smooth all year round.  Not too extreme, though.  No, no.  North Carolina extreme!  Well, Syracuse is pretty extreme.  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  I just picture you guys always, you know, it's got to be extreme!  No, that word died in the 90s.  It did, huh?  Yeah.  We can relate, though, because they still call us shock jocks.  It's like, oh, all right, we get it.  He's eating shocking!  No, look how shocking we are.  Watch me be real shocking.  So now what do you do? 
[00:57:00]  BMX, right?  I ride BMX, yeah.  Ride BMX.  Right, he's like one of the greatest athletes ever, as far as X Games go.  I know.  And the bike riding.  I know.  I hear things.  You got a little banana seed on your bike?  High handle bar.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got the, yeah, I got the schwinds thing right.  I'm going to smile.  See bar on the back.  That'd be cool if you...  A basket.  How cool would that be?  You go to one of those events with your sister's bike, with the tassels.  Little bell. 
[00:57:30]  They would respect you.  That would be hilarious.  I never was a very good bike rider.  I got a moped when I was 15, and I fell off it.  A moped?  Yeah, I was a faggot.  Yeah, that's like the, yeah, the moped, that's kind of like the, yeah, you want to, you know.  You want to get away from the moped.  How old a guy are you?  How old of a guy am I?  I'm about 31.  Yeah, when did you start BMX?  I started when I was a young little toddler there.  Spry little tot. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, no training wheels, and just, you know, I was just, I had a dream at a young age, and  now here I am.  Were you one of those crazy kids?  Like, because I knew growing up, there was always a crazy kid that would do anything on  the bike.  You could get him to just, you know, make the ramp, jump over the garbage pails.  Well, you know, I mean, I think I was crazy, but I also was pretty calculated.  I had a buddy, you know, Shane Frazier a long time ago, man, good friend, and I said,  hey, man, I'll show you all my tricks if you jump this creek first.  Really?  He jumped it, broke his bike, and I think I still, I still never told him why.  He still brings it up, man.  It's pretty funny.  What are you, like, can you stand, a friend of mine can stand, this guy George Gallo's 
[00:58:30]  a comedian, can actually stand on a handlebar.  I know George Gallo, actually.  I know George from way back.  He's pretty good on a bike, actually.  I know George from the 80s, man, shit, that's awesome.  From bike riding?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, George is better than I thought.  George Gallo, yeah.  I thought he was just a psycho who did tricks on the street, but he's actually legit.  Oh, he told you that he used to do this?  No, no, I saw him do it, and he's a fucking maniac, George.  He is a maniac.  Yeah.  And when he was in the street, he was kind of standing on the handlebars, and he was actually very  good for a comic.  I'm like, what the fuck's he doing?  Growing up, though, I remember kids being pretty crazy on their bikes and stuff, but 
[00:59:00]  then it reached a point where, you know, it got, they actually started putting pegs  on the bicycles, you know, on the wheels and on the back, and people were standing on  the front wheel and spinning the bike around and stuff, and I think that kind of took off,  like, if you're in your early 30s, that kind of...  Like the late 80s.  Yeah.  We had 80s around, yeah, when the pegs started getting on the bikes, probably like 86, 87.  Yeah, but you were doing it before that, right?  Yeah, I mean, I was, you know, within my, you know, age range. 
[00:59:30]  I mean, I raced in 84, I was 10, you know, was doing it all around the neighborhood, you  know, before then, kind of just grew up on a bike and never really got off, you know?  Yeah.  When did you know that you could make a living riding a bike?  When I got the first paycheck.  It was, it's kind of funny.  I turned pro in 92 when I was a senior in high school, and the only money I really made  was going on tour in the summertime, which was awesome, you know, in between 10th and  11th grade, everybody's sitting home, they're, you know, they're playing in the ball fields, 
[01:00:00]  and I was traveling the country at a young age like that for three months, come back  right before school started, and just, you know, and that's, I made probably three grand  a year kind of thing, but it was good, you know, back then, made it last, and, you know,  worked some part-time jobs, and did what I had to do.  And September 94, a couple years out of high school is when I made my first paycheck, and  that was $1,000 a month.  Wow.  So, I mean, amazingly, I mean, it's crazy, because, you know, I moved to Greenville,  lived in a one-bedroom apartment, upgraded to a two-bedroom, and just saved money, and  just things kind of changed, and I've been there for 10 years, and it's been a pretty 
[01:00:30]  cool, pretty cool road.  Oh, yeah.  Are there bike groupies?  Every group has, I mean, you're an athlete, so you've got to get laid.  There's got to be chicks that just want to get laid.  As an athlete, it's like, athletes do nothing but fall into box.  It's amazing.  Well, you know, I have a fiancé now, but, you know, Greenville's a pretty cool college  town.  It's a small town, big college, southern girls.  It's definitely, but, you know, it's just a distraction anyway.  You know, you're out every night, and, you know, you all know the game, I guess, so. 
[01:01:00]  And these people's 50 most sexy bachelors.  Oh, God.  God, thank you.  Isn't that great?  Ooh.  Look at what publicists can do for you.  It's amazing.  He and I are not that far off.  I mean, we both have a little cut.  You just don't have the same publicist, man.  Just think, if you're the same publicist, Scott will probably do some work for you.  Probably get in there next year.  There's a slight twist in the DNA strand that just kind of made it a little different.  He's a chiseled jaw athlete, and I have just two meat tits.  There.  None of us in this room.  No one else in this room made the top thousand. 
[01:01:30]  Top 50.  Top 50.  What number were you?  Who beat you out?  Yeah, who was right ahead of you.  Who was right ahead of you, where you're like, oh, come on, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on.  I know people are saying that about me.  You know, you walk through town.  I swear I felt a little vibe when I'm going through Greenwood, and I'm like, oh, he thinks  he's all this top shit now, because he's on that list.  Like, I was, like, living for that list.  Yeah, like you campaigned for it or something.  Yeah, yeah, like publicist throws you in there.  It was just funny. 
[01:02:00]  I don't know where I was in there, but it was just pretty hilarious.  You should put that on a shirt.  I would just put that on a shirt.  Haters.  Put weird numbers and point at it to a girl and go, ahem, get sucking.  That didn't work.  I always wondered why BMX guys don't make the jump to motorcycles.  You know what?  I always wanted a dirt bike when I was a little kid.  Parents wouldn't do it.  Got a 250 a couple years ago.  A lot of fun.  I mean, but it's two different things.  I mean, you know, to me, a dirt bike is, in a lot of ways, less creative. 
[01:02:30]  There's less you can do on it.  Yeah, you can race, but I'm not going to be a top racer at any time soon.  You know, that's...  You know, you look at Ricky Carmichael, those guys, they kill it.  I mean, it's just amazing.  But, you know, if you knew more about BMX, there's so much more creativity, what you can  do, and options.  And it's not that, you know, I'm afraid to ride a dirt bike, anything like that.  It's just, to me, jumping...  I wasn't getting there, sir.  I wasn't implying that, sir.  No, no, no.  But I'm kind of explaining why we wouldn't change over.  It's just a passion that, with BMX, I love dirt bikes. 
[01:03:00]  I mean, jumping a 50-foot set of doubles on a dirt bike is amazing, especially when you  have a front shock on there.  It's an amazing thing.  But, you know, BMX is pretty...  Some of the kids, you should look around the city, you probably see guys, man.  Oh, yeah.  It's a pretty good street ride.  But you've got to pedal real fast, though.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the only problem.  Yeah, it's that pedaling thing gets me...  And you've got the bell on the...  You know, ringing the bell.  Right, you're ringing it.  The papers, throwing the papers out.  I'm sick of the paper route.  Still got a paper route, you know? 
[01:03:30]  Hey, how many bones have you broken, Ryan?  You had to have gone out a few times.  You know, I've been relatively pretty, you know, fortunate in that department.  I broke my shoulder, a couple ligaments here and there, you know, small bones in a foot,  small bones in a hand, lost my spleen.  That was a pretty major one.  Lost your spleen?  Yeah, that was a pretty good crash.  How do you lose your spleen?  Did someone land on you?  No, just hit the ground real hard and your ribs are cut into it or something like that.  I mean, there's ways you can, you know, puncture it and you can hit it just hard enough to 
[01:04:00]  swell it up.  It's a pretty weak organ, I guess.  You know, you've had less injuries than our fat friend who jumped up to try to catch a football.  That's what an athlete is.  Gets hurt a few times over all these years and our fat friend, Bob, gets hurt to catch a football  and he falls on his leg and he fucking breaks it and he still can't walk.  Snaps it.  Wow.  That's the difference between someone who conditions themselves.  Old stick of chalk leg.  Yeah, and fat turk that Bob looks like.  Let's go to the phone and say hi to Mike in Philly. 
[01:04:30]  What's up, Mike?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Dave, I was just wondering, that MTV show you do with all the drunk chicks, how many  of them have you nailed?  None, man.  None at all.  None?  I keep my distance, man.  They're fun people.  They're funny.  They get a lot of drama.  You know, they do their thing, but I keep my distance.  Hey, what show is that?  I don't even know that show.  The Real World Road Rules Challenge.  Oh, you're the, okay.  I hosted the Inferno 1 and 2 and kind of on the side.  It was interesting.  It was cool.  Right.  Awesome.  I used to like, well, I haven't watched The Real World and Road Rules Challenge. 
[01:05:00]  I used to really enjoy that.  Just saw one recently, and I haven't watched it either, but then I recently popped it on.  Seems pretty cool.  Yeah.  Watching them all bitch and moan about things with each other.  Oh, yeah, they got crazy next last one.  One team sucks.  One team, you know, the other team is the evil team.  They're bad.  And there's the good guys, bad guys thing.  Oh, you saw the recent one then.  Yes, I did.  Yeah, there you go.  Where they're in the boat.  A little boat challenge that they had to go back and forth.  Oh, back and forth there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was pretty good. 
[01:05:30]  That's funny.  Let's go to Wes in Florida.  Wes?  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, I just wanted to say, Mira, you rock, but how did it feel getting punked?  You know what, man?  I got to say my punked episode, I can't say that it was, I mean, you probably saw it, and  it wasn't too convincing to me because they were, you know, and they kind of left out a  lot of stuff that I said kind of in joking because I walked in there and I knew it automatically.  Yeah, well, explain your episode for the people that didn't see it.  Okay, here's kind of what happened, that they said that FBI guys, you know, roped off the 
[01:06:00]  office of my agent's place and said that, you know, I was storing money overseas or  my agent was ripping me off.  I had these big contracts, wasn't paying my taxes.  And, I mean, the easiest thing was I said, okay, well, let me see my real contracts if  you're the FBI.  Can you produce a couple of real ones before you show me a bunch of fake ones?  And they're like, oh, they're around here somewhere.  We just can't find them.  So, I mean, and I said, okay, so, you know, kind of, you know, I'm playing the joke. 
[01:06:30]  I'm looking at a piece of paper, kind of trying to act like this is punked, if it is, and I'm  pretty sure it was.  How am I going to ruin this?  I don't want to ruin this episode.  Yeah, because you want to be on punk.  Yeah, yeah, I want to play along.  Were you looking out of the corner of the eye for a camera or something?  Oh, I looked, yeah, I was looking around at these fake TVs and stuff.  And then finally I saw one and then they called it.  But I said, they're like, I go, okay, I'll start talking.  If you guys both get on my bike and ride double around the office, I'll start talking.  I didn't put that in there.  And I said, and one of the guys, I said, man, your sister's got a real attitude problem.  They didn't use that.  You know, this thing, one guy was bitching, one guy was noise. 
[01:07:00]  I am so glad someone is finally admitting this.  Because when I watch punk, there are people that really do get punked.  Yeah.  And then you see others that you see it in their face, that they're onto the gag, but they're  just playing along.  And then you know they're going to edit it in such a way where it looks like they really  got punked.  Yep.  Yeah.  I was kind of hoping they were going to play it the other way for a change, do something where  like he didn't.  And I'm just kind of just goofing back and just trying to.  One guy was just seriously like trying to just get me to crack and he, you know, real  pissed.  And I'm just in my head, I'm laughing going, this is, you know, it just doesn't work.  This is punked, you idiot.  Well, he says, you know, he says, Dave, your agent, you know, flew, went to the Cayman Islands 
[01:07:30]  with your money.  And I said, really?  Well, why did he come all over?  We were in Ohio the night before.  And I, and I switched my flight to, to go to a different city in LA, you know, to make  this thing happen.  And, uh, and I said, well, well, why did he come all the way back to LA to go to Cayman  Islands?  Aren't they under Florida?  Well, I mean, what's the deal here?  And like he flew to LA to get on a plane to go to Cayman Islands.  So if he was in Ohio, he was going to steal my money.  Why didn't he just leave?  You know, it was just hilarious.  And just, but I got to see the episode.  Yeah.  But now that I got to see it, knowing that you knew.  He ripped you off. 
[01:08:00]  Exactly.  All right.  Uh, Wes, there you have it.  Hey, man, appreciate it.  I don't know if I'm a party rock.  I'm punching out.  All right.  Party rock.  Uh, let's go to Mike.  What's going on, Mike?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good.  We're hanging out with Dave Mira.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  I, uh, I don't remember where, but I met Dave once.  I just want to know, did he start BMX racing or did he just go straight into freestyle?  I know him and his brother, Rod.  Yeah, I started, uh, I raced in, uh, 84 just a few times. 
[01:08:30]  I was at a local track and track was like 45 minutes away and parents were working.  So I just played in the street and we kind of just, you know, built jumps.  And that's kind of how I got started really.  It was just more convenient to ride every day, just wherever and find whatever hill, jump,  you know, in the neighborhood.  Yeah, because I met you at a race.  I mean, you're a really nice guy.  I got to give you credit, man.  You're doing a good job.  You know, you're really doing the sport well.  I mean, I had to quit.  I got hurt.  But, you know, I still enjoy seeing you on TV, watching you ride.  The video game's awesome.  Cool.  Thank you, man. 
[01:09:00]  Keep it up, man.  You're doing the sport well.  Thanks, man.  Appreciate it.  Got a video game?  Had one, yeah.  Yeah.  I think it claimed kind of, kind of dumped out.  That's kind of cool, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Part of a video game.  Definitely.  Definitely.  Immortalized that way.  Definitely.  It's so cool to see, you know, the X Games just completely taking over, man.  It's a lot of fun to watch.  Because, I mean, all the sports are just, ugh.  Yeah.  Well, I got to say, I know, it's like a Jimmy question.  I'm sorry.  But, it really, I mean, it's so much more exciting, you know, the X Games and what's going on with 
[01:09:30]  that.  It's just cool that kids can, you know, as they go through school.  And I know back when I was younger, when I rode a bike, it wasn't the coolest thing in  the world to do when everybody, you know, got cars and when they're 16 years old.  And it's just kind of cool to see that, you know, it's more of a lifestyle driven.  It's not a team sport.  It's not.  And I think at first it kind of started as like a goof.  No offense, but it was like, oh, look at these guys on their bikes and their skateboards.  But then somewhere along the line, it turned and now it's just dead serious. 
[01:10:00]  It's awesome.  And you can make a lot of money and the endorsement deals and, you know, the video games, it's  just blown up.  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.  I mean, you know, mainstream sports got to the point where it's like, if you're not  a certain size, you really can't, you know, I mean, back when...  Oh, you got to be huge.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  If you're not born with an extra leg, you know, I mean, you're going to play basketball  or something.  Yeah.  It is pretty nuts.  But it's cool to see kids can go through it and be, you know, more fitted.  I guess you can fit in more or less going through school.  And it's kind of, it's awesome to see that. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi in Todd in New Jersey.  Todd, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Dave, man, I wanted to ask you a question.  My little brother owns Fusion down in Greenville.  Got it.  And he talks about you all the time.  How did you pick Greenville, of all places to live?  You know, my brother moved down there in 94 with his girlfriend at the time.  She was from New York and her parents moved down to North Carolina.  And they had a little, small, little city skate park, which is JC Park. 
[01:11:00]  It's still there.  Syracuse was, you know, it was cold in the winters.  We didn't have really any place to ride, nobody to ride with.  So I just said, you know what?  I went and visited, like, maybe three times and said, man, my lease was up in my apartment.  It was March 95, and I just packed up a rider truck and headed down.  Oh, man.  Packed up the old rider truck.  From where?  Syracuse.  Syracuse is a cold, cold place.  I lived in Rochester for a while, so.  There you go. 
[01:11:30]  Syracuse, it's probably still snowing up there, I'm assuming.  I think, yeah.  I mean, it's just ridiculous.  It snows until late April every year.  I mean, you think it's cold here in New York today, Ant?  Nah.  Syracuse blows it away.  Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo.  Ugh.  All right.  Where are you off to?  It's going back.  You're just going back to Greenville?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep.  Yep, heading back to Greenville, and you're in shock.  No, because I know you have to catch a plane, that's all.  Yeah, no, I'm going to head back to Greenville, and then what's coming up next week, I guess, 
[01:12:00]  is pretty cool.  It's the Do Action Sports Tour, and that starts next weekend in Louisville.  It's going to be a five-stop tour, and it's kind of one of its kind in a sense.  It's a series instead of, you know, like X Games is a one-off, one big event a year,  which is awesome for a lot of the riders in terms of, you know, going there, bringing  their biggest stuff, throwing it all out, and if you get hurt, cool.  If you don't, you know, cool.  So now we have a, you know, a five-stop series, which is going to kind of rely on being consistent  and competitive and safe, healthy and fun, and wow. 
[01:12:30]  Good luck, man.  Thanks.  One more call from Steve in Boston.  Go ahead, Steve.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  This is Bipolar Steve.  Okay.  I'm just calling to ask Dave about when he was paralyzed or something like that.  You were paralyzed?  No, no.  I was never paralyzed, but I got hit by that drunk driver pretty badly.  He got a blood cloud in my brain, fractured skull, and a dislocated shoulder, and I was  out pretty much for about eight months. 
[01:13:00]  Jeez.  When did this happen?  It was 1993.  Wow.  You were just riding in the street, and this guy, what, he jumped a curb?  No, I was actually walking across the street, leaving a club, and this girl underage, drinking  and driving, just hit me going like 45.  My friend said I was just flying through the air.  Wow.  So I got lucky, actually.  Damn.  Underage, chick, drunk.  Yeah.  Too bad you couldn't be in the passenger seat.  You could have definitely scored with that nice young impression.  Jesus.  Play dead.  All right.  Ben is saying you got to go. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  Dave Mira, thank you so much for stopping by.  Thanks for having me.  We appreciate it.  Good luck to you.  Have a good day.  All right.  There he goes, Dave Mira.  And we'll continue with the O&A show in just a bit.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no.  I'm going to give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little cup right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear.  Maybe bang me up the ass.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me. 
[01:14:00]  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  I'm not going to be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the PF thing.  Put it between the boobs.  Put it in the pits.  Put it in the pits.  My favorite oral treat.  My favorite eating cock. 
[01:14:30]  I'm hungry for a big, fat, juicy cock.  After I whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Shoot your big wad  That's going to come right into my mouth.  Oh, God.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  Oh, God.  After I whack you off, I want you to bang me up the ass. 
[01:15:00]  I'm hungry for a hard-nailed cock.  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  That's scaring me.  I take it in the rear.  I'm a freak.  That's what I was taught.  I got a big, juicy cock from Ben the other day.  Oh, I like the bananas.  Oh, God.  I like the bananas.  I'm a freak.  I enjoy having sex with a guy.  I enjoy something in my mouth.  I enjoy cock between the boobs.  I enjoy cock in my tight ass. 
[01:15:30]  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  And Anthony Shaw.  I am alone.  Ever-ending night.  I don't believe it's fading. 
[01:16:00]  I am alone.  Inside I am alone.  All right.  Give it a try, Anthony.  Okay.  Here it is.  Oh, Jesus.  Wait a minute.  I'm back on my mic that I was using this morning.  Yeah.  And I'm...  You're still a little hot.  Apparently they're fixing it.  A little hot.  A little hot.  And I'm... 
[01:16:30]  This is great that a radio show can spend half the morning just making sure the microphone  of one of the hosts is right.  Yeah.  It kind of works.  This is...  Sounds good.  It's...  No.  No?  It's very...  It's very bassy.  It's still distorting a bit on me.  I hear when I kind of get loud a little bit.  And it's really...  Why can't it sound like that one?  Like, it doesn't sound anything like this one.  Nothing like that one.  It's not bad, though. 
[01:17:00]  It's not as bad as it was.  But you hear at the high end of it, you could hear it like when my volume peaks a little bit.  If I start talking like this, you get that...  Like that tin can sound.  I'm going to adjust your DB.  No, you're not adjusting anything.  Eric, go into this one and adjust this one right here.  Don't touch that one.  This is the lifeboat.  Does someone have a screwdriver?  No screwdrivers.  I can't wear two headphones.  How do you guys do this?  I feel like I'm drowning.  No, you've got to wear two headphones.  Never. 
[01:17:30]  You keep one off.  I have to.  I'm wearing two right now, and no one in Radioland cares, and I don't give a shit.  This is awful.  Really?  No, why?  Because your ears are too small.  I have little ears.  Mm-hmm.  Aw.  See, I got this really bassy sound.  It's very bassy.  And then, is this one on?  Is this one on?  Um, now it is.  All right.  Now, drop something.  I'll put these back on, and... 
[01:18:00]  There we go.  That...  See, I like this much better.  All right, get rid of that mic.  This mic is going.  Put it over there, Ant.  Don't look at it.  I'm not even going to look at it.  All right.  Are we all set?  There we go.  We're back.  Hey, Jeff.  Did you put this where it was?  On the board?  Yeah, put it back on?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put it where it was.  Wait, Marge readjusted yours.  That one right there.  No.  Hold on.  I want it where it was.  Um, Marge, let me move the dB a little bit.  Seemed a little louder. 
[01:18:30]  That's good.  There you go.  Yeah.  See, that's where it was.  All right.  I could tell.  It was just a little bit.  I like that.  I just had to add a little gain.  This is perfect.  A little gain to your microphone.  A little gain.  And a little DSL.  All right, Jeff.  What's up?  Hello, Jeff.  Hey, I got...  Hello?  Hello.  Yeah, I got Rich Voss at the local radio show down in Fort Lauderdale.  Oh.  We love following Voss around the country.  Yeah.  All right, let's listen in.  All right, hold on a second.  You know, uh, life's been good with, uh, me trying to say that, you know, 
[01:19:00]  I don't know, it isn't as extravagant of a lifestyle as it would appear.  And I'm just, uh, uh, I, uh, took it as far as I could go.  I went into recovery just to...  Oh, they're doing, um, that's, uh, what's his name?  Stand up.  Yeah, that's a clip of somebody that they're playing.  All right, we're not going to waste time on that today. 
[01:19:30]  Uh, we, we just missed, uh, Voss on that show, I guess.  All right, where are we?  Yeah, where the hell were we?  I don't know, because the microphone's throwing me off today.  I hate this.  Oh, the, the sleep thing.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy was, uh, during commercials, was telling us that he was having nightmares last night.  Nightmares, they're so scary.  I always have them.  You always have nightmares?  Really?  Yeah, I don't sleep well.  Like every night?  I don't know if it's every night, but it's a lot of nights where I, I, I just remember specifically last night 
[01:20:00]  being in this terror, and like, and not like the exorcist's face, but the exact face that flashes in the exorcist's face.  Yeah, yeah.  White face.  That flashes like twice during the film.  I was seeing that, and I'm looking right at it, and I'm like, I know this is, I'm awake, but I can't move.  I'm like, I know this is not real.  So wait, was it a nightmare, or you were awake?  A nightmare that bleeds into that being like half asleep, half awake, where you can't move, you're paralyzed. 
[01:20:30]  You have that night paralysis thing?  I have that too.  It's awful.  Holy shit.  I, I never talked about it because I thought I was nuts.  You, you are nuts.  Well, I know I'm nuts.  If you want to also have this.  But if I know, but if I know I'm nuts, am I really nuts?  Yes.  Yeah, I think that's bullshit.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Crazy person knows that crazy.  I don't know he was anti-Semitic.  Didn't change anything.  No, that happens to me too.  I never talked about it because I just didn't want to.  It creeped me out too much.  There are times that I feel like I'm awake and I'll see things in my room. 
[01:21:00]  Oh boy.  And like kind of, I can't even explain it, like a ghosty thing.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  And uh, that would be me.  And then I try to move.  Just because you want to move to feel like you're, maybe you could do something I guess.  Stop whining.  And I can't, I can't move at all.  Wow.  I get this, I'm telling you, I get the same fucking thing. 
[01:21:30]  And it's like, your body feels like it's like a low electrical hum.  Like if you put your ear next to a high tension wire, like.  Right.  That's you, you'll feel like your whole body has this awful tingle hum to it.  And there's a lot of people that like.  I almost feel like I get shocked.  Yeah, exactly.  Like a shock.  And then I try to move and I feel like there's an energy trying to like, just escape from  my body.  Like I'm going to have an out of body experience.  That's weird.  That's not what it is though, but people mistake it for out of body experience. 
[01:22:00]  Okay, well that's what I feel like.  I feel like, I'm definitely not moving, but I feel like an energy trying to force its way  out of my body.  I have a weird sleep thing.  Right before I nod off sometimes, like right before you're at that really weird part where  you're just about to nod off.  Also, I wake up with some kind of sound in my head goes like.  Oh, I get that.  Like that, you go.  And you wake up and go, what the hell is that?  And then you try to get back to sleep.  And every time you start getting. 
[01:22:30]  You have to switch positions.  Yeah, you got to do something.  You can't just keep laying there getting the, in your head.  That's the, yeah.  What the fuck is that?  I think it's got something to do with energy because we are made up of energy technically.  I think that has something to do with it.  I mean, that's just my guess.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's some stupid thing we just don't do.  It's annoying as all hell, but at least it's not paralysis and fucking scary faces in  your face.  Dude, it's in the same family.  And I'll tell you about getting punched in the face when I'm in that half paralysis thing  and it feels real. 
[01:23:00]  It's really real because I'm conscious.  Yeah.  I'm like, I know this is happening.  I'm like, I know I'm in my bed.  And since I just moved in on my new pad, as I call it.  Yeah.  I have a, I'm sleeping with these black shades on.  Uh-oh.  Well, I have to because I don't have my room darkening curtain yet.  Black.  Those little, those eye things that you get on the plane.  You know, they, they.  You're wearing things that cover your eyes.  Yeah.  Like, are they, are they like quilted and cushy?  No, they didn't.  And they got the elastic around the back?  Yeah, yeah.  Like Mrs. Roper.  I didn't want to think of it like Mrs. Roper. 
[01:23:30]  I thought more of myself as Michelle Pfeiffer in Scarface.  No.  I'm seeing Mrs. Roper.  I'm seeing Mrs. Roper or Ruth Buzzy in a laughing sketch.  Joanne Worley.  Yeah, very good.  Pops up.  Who's here?  Who's here?  Oh.  Well, that's what I do.  I just dream that Stanley is, won't fuck me because I'm trying to, oh, Stanley.  And then he punches you in the face. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, and his little demon friend flashes in my head.  Kev Slider from Whack Bag says, you're supposedly, sorry, still asleep while in that state.  It feels like someone is sitting on your stomach or your back.  You're in a sleep state.  Maybe technically.  It is the weirdest feeling.  Move.  Move your arms.  And then I'm like, all right, I know I'm awake now.  And I try to pull my thing off, my, these eye things off.  Yeah.  I'm like, let me go pull them off because I know I'm awake now.  But as they're pulling off, my clothes are coming with them. 
[01:24:30]  So I'm like trapped.  And I can't get out from under them.  Because you're still dreaming this.  I'm still asleep.  Dude, it was really, the more I'm remembering it, it's like, give me the creeps.  That is creepy.  I kept thinking like, all right, dude, you're finally awake now.  Just get up.  And then it would be like that thing.  You fall out in that awful energy.  I hate that.  Oh, it's awful.  It gets in your ears.  It's actually, you hear something.  You feel it.  And it's in your head.  You know what I get?  That's awful.  You know what I get in the middle of the night, too, is extremely hard erections. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, I've had that.  Well, yeah.  Extremely hard, though.  You get that.  Very uncomfortable.  But you've got to grab it and squeeze it.  You've got to actually grab it and go, urgh!  It has something to do with the full bladder.  Huh?  You should have saw the mess I cleaned up this morning.  I don't know what the hell happened at two in the morning last night.  You wet in your bed?  No, not the bed.  You're a little sticky.  I staggered into the...  We'll clean you up and I'll tell you what it was.  I staggered into the bathroom and I had one of these raging ones.  And I had to take a leak and... 
[01:25:30]  You've got to bow like a Buddhist in order to piss.  I was going to say...  I had to bend at the waist so it's shooting.  I couldn't...  Spread your legs.  I couldn't tilt far enough.  I couldn't get the angle.  Yeah, exactly.  I couldn't...  Put a headstand.  I actually had my...  I'm doing a visual, I know.  I actually had my hands like this on the wall behind the toilet.  Like you're being frisked.  And then I was trying to get my legs up on the door and I just couldn't get the angle  right.  So you've got to push down as hard as you can without it hurting.  Well, you can only push down far enough too or you're blocking the hose, so to speak. 
[01:26:00]  Right.  You can't do that.  And then when you try to squeeze out that last bit at the end, it comes out like a cannon.  Yeah.  Right.  Now you're overshooting the bowl.  So then I had a kind of like...  It's kind of like I was playing golf, I guess.  I was...  Is it a six iron or a seven iron?  I was backing up a little bit.  Yeah, you don't know how far back to stand.  And then, you know, I...  And you're half asleep and, you know, I got most of it in.  But, I mean, then I woke up this morning and went, wow. 
[01:26:30]  Wow, what a mess.  You know what you've got to do when that happens?  Just to stop the hard iron, you give yourself a paper cut right across the hole.  You take a piece of like...  Oh, stop it!  Right, maybe a harder piece of computer paper.  Mm-hmm.  And you just across the open hole.  I can't listen to this.  Wow.  Or even under like on the top half, under the helmet, where the helmet and the shaft meet,  you just give a nice...  Ow!  Ow!  Like that, yes.  Exactly.  Like, like, like...  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:27:00]  It's just...  Ah, I got a paper cut!  I got a paper cut, dude!  Watch, it's just a paper cut, Ant.  Just watch.  No, I'll do one for you.  Nope.  Ow!  No.  Oh.  Look, Ant, just right between the fingers.  That's all.  Look at the web right there.  No.  Watch.  I'm not looking.  Watch, right?  No.  Oh.  Stop it.  Hawke has something to say about this.  Yeah, what were you saying, Eric? 
[01:27:30]  You were saying something.  You wrote me a little note about the lifting thing.  Yeah, you're like...  Oh, this would...  It's good when we all have to relate in the studio here.  I had the, um...  Similar to what Jim had.  You're just laying there and you feel like something is lifting you.  But it's not that out-of-body stuff.  Nobody cares, Eric.  See?  So I remember one time when I was in Tennessee, I had a weird thing where I, um...  We did not get him again, did we? 
[01:28:00]  We didn't...  He's leaving the studio, practically.  I'm playing, I'm busting your balls, dude.  Yeah, relax.  Don't cry.  There's no crying on the radio.  Nurse Nuts, uh...  Actually, what were you saying, dude?  I'm busting your balls a little bit.  You can't get mad at it.  What?  Are you making me believe you have to bilge?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Stop figuring it out.  What are you doing?  I'm trying to talk to you.  You have a little teary gulp going on, and then he made me believe he had a...  He had a bilge or something.  Comes in, we're hugging.  Next thing.  All right, listen.  Nurse Nuts from whackbag.com.  It's okay.  During, uh... 
[01:28:30]  REM sleep.  REM.  Yeah, but I like the band, so...  I call it REM sleep.  Oh, that's...  I like that.  That's age sleep.  Your brain shuts your muscles off so you don't hurt yourself while you're dreaming.  Oh, you move when you're dreaming.  Oh, that's actually...  Maybe that's a good point, though.  Oh, during REM sleep, you say.  Maybe that's a good point.  Maybe so you don't...  Or maybe so you don't expend energy.  Maybe your body's not thinking you're hurting yourself.  Maybe it's an energy-saving device like a refrigerator.  You know what?  I never thought about this before.  Tom in Tennessee.  Go ahead, Tom.  Obi, what the hell?  I mean, you know, why wrestle with your dick at 2 o'clock in the morning? 
[01:29:00]  Just stand up and piss in the shower like a man.  Piss in the shower?  Yep.  Hey, it's not a bad idea, actually.  It would have saved a lot of cleanup at 5 in the morning.  You know, at Bonnaroo last year when I was performing at that festival, we stayed 45 minutes  from the gig because the hotels were all sold out.  I pissed the bed.  I don't think I've talked about that yet.  Oh, boy.  What?  I wet my bed.  This is about a year and a half ago.  I think it's right before we came back on the air.  I performed at the Bonnaroo Festival with Voss and Bonnie and Louis C.K.  Did you get some on Voss' leg? 
[01:29:30]  No, it was just me in the room.  So you were sleeping with him?  No, it certainly wasn't.  He had her with him.  Oh, homewrecker.  I wound up wetting my bed.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  I think you wet the bed.  That was really loud.  Dude, I totally forgot about that.  Yeah, that was whenever Bonnaroo was.  It was the last Bonnaroo.  Did you dream that you were taking a leak?  No, I don't remember.  I might have, and I woke up and there was a big wet stain.  I'm like, I've got to talk about this.  Because that happened to me as a kid a few times where it wasn't like bedwetting where you 
[01:30:00]  have a problem bedwetting or anything, but you had a dream where you're taking a leak.  You're standing in front of the toilet and you're just, and obviously it's because you  had to take a leak real bad when you're sleeping, and you wake up to a little bit of warmth  and wetness.  It's bedwetting.  On you.  How is that not bedwetting?  Well, it's not like chronic bedwetting where you've got to wear a diaper or anything like  that.  It just happens once or twice in your entire childhood, and that's what happened.  We've got to go right to the phones.  I'm sorry, guys.  All right. 
[01:30:30]  Stalker Patty has a sleep disorder.  Of course she does.  Patty?  Hi.  There have been times when I've gotten up and didn't remember getting up, and I'll find  myself in the bathroom brushing my teeth, and I'm like, I don't remember coming here.  Sometimes I'm out on the fire escape going, Lulu!  Lulu!  When I spend overnight at people's house, they say I mumble and talk in my sleep, but I don't  remember doing that.  She's annoying even in sleep.  Patty, did you ever have a really horrible nightmare that you were a valued person in society? 
[01:31:00]  Oh, stop it.  I am valued.  I think that's how.  She must have that dream.  You know how people have sometimes anxiety or stress dreams at work?  So she probably has that dream like Lucy at the chocolate factory with conveyor belts  going by real fast with the chocolates, and she can't get them packed quickly enough?  You know what?  Shut up, Patty.  I got a ... God, you just brought up another thing, another memory here.  I have my worst dream. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  I got two of them.  One is that I have finals at college.  Wow.  You're still having college dreams?  It's so weird in that I'm going to fail, or I'm going to miss the test, that whole thing,  or I'm just not going to get the work done, and there's only like a day left, and it's  the same dream all night long.  Yeah.  Okay?  Everyone has this, depending on what kind of life you have.  You have your recurring dreams.  That one is kind of boring, whatever.  Well, you can't find your books or something because they're covered in marshmallows.  All right. 
[01:32:00]  Jesus, I went with it, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I couldn't find my books.  You fuck.  Oh, wait.  My litty's not ready to come out yet.  Oh, yeah?  Mine comes out at 9.30.  Where is he?  Yeah.  Notice I drew a goatee on mine.  Did you?  Yeah, it's the evil litty.  Look.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, anyway.  But a dream I have to this day is I'm back being just a dopey DJ spinning tunes and could 
[01:32:30]  be fired at any time, and I got a record playing, and the record is ending, and I cannot find  anything else to play.  The jock's nightmare.  At all.  Yeah.  And it goes on all night, that anxiety of seeing the record running out, and I can't  get another record on the air.  That's normal for a DJ.  That's one of those work-related stress ones.  Right.  But then, eventually, like, then I give myself a break in the middle of the dream. 
[01:33:00]  This is probably after hours of stressing, like, ah, ah, ah, and feeling the anxiety.  And then I find, like, Uriah Heep, Greatest Hits, but Easy Living's not on it.  I know I'm going really obscure here, but this is what happened to my brain.  I'm like, oh, Uriah Heep, that one song, Easy Living, okay.  And this is all going on in my head, and it's like, everything else is on this CD except  that one.  So now I have to play some obscure Uriah Heep song, and that almost makes it okay. 
[01:33:30]  But then that record starts to end, and now I have nothing.  Now you're doing a twofer of Uriah Heep.  Why don't you just look for the next fucking song while Uriah Heep is playing?  I don't get it.  And then where the CDs are supposed to be in the studio, there's just a wall.  There's no CDs even in the studio anymore.  That's the stress one.  I used to get the, when we were fired, I used to get the dream that we got our jobs back.  Oh, I had that one.  And it was so cool, like, all of a sudden we're sitting there doing the show, and I'm  like, oh, this is great, we got our jobs back. 
[01:34:00]  And then you wake up, and it's like, son of a bitch, I'm still fired.  And then there's another recurring dream I have that's the opposite of that, and I have  this one a lot, and I don't know where the hell it comes from.  The dream somehow, you know, wherever it starts, goes into, I had apparently been involved  in killing somebody at some point in my life.  It could be years ago, it could be a few weeks ago, or something.  I don't get that one, too.  And you're hoping no one knows. 
[01:34:30]  And you're hoping no one knows, but there's cops that are onto it somehow, and they're  going to question me, and I'm thinking, oh my God, this happened years ago, but I know  there's evidence, there's got to be DNA, I wasn't careful about this, I'm going to  fucking prison.  The anxiety and the stress in that one is that, you know, they're sort of starting to  get onto you.  Right, they're starting to.  But they're not onto you.  Not onto you yet, but I'm positive they're going to catch me.  They're starting to figure it out.  They're going to get a hair, or something, or I'm going to fold on the questioning, or 
[01:35:00]  I'm completely going to screw it up.  And it's so scary.  And then when you wake up, you're like, you go from being completely in trouble to, oh  my God, I'm not in trouble.  And you're like, oh, I didn't kill anybody.  Have you ever woke up and went, oh my God, thank God.  Yeah, thank God.  Totally.  It's the best.  You go, oh, I'm not in trouble.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, I didn't kill somebody.  It happens all the time.  Yeah, but then it happens the other way, where you're banging the hottest chick in the world, 
[01:35:30]  and you have the love, just that ultimate feeling of just happiness and stuff, and you wake  up like, hey, where did that life go?  Oh, fuck.  It's funny, because I keep having this dream that I'm dead, and some asshole DJ is getting  away with it.  Oh, I got you.  He's the corpse.  That's funny.  All right, I got you.  No reason to play birds chirping. 
[01:36:00]  Easy, lady.  See, he's the dead guy that we killed, and we get away with it every time because we wake  up.  Then there's numerous plane crash ones, but it's always usually a slow motion, weird plane  crash.  I get in this 747, but it's, I don't know, it's 15 seats wide, the pilot's sitting in  the middle with the passengers.  Why would he be there?  Absolutely.  And you'd think that would tip me off to the fact that it's not real, and he goes to take  off, and of course the runway is the expressway, and there's trees in the way, and you kind 
[01:36:30]  of, all these anxiety, creepy dreams.  So you don't know what that means, by the way.  Yeah.  What?  When you try, hold on.  Hold on, you babbling idiot.  Dreams actually have a weird significance, and that one is actually a weird fear of being  on a plane flown by a man in coach.  Yeah, true.  It's a very, very basic fear.  That is a basic fear.  I would not want my pilot sitting in coach.  In coach.  Back in caveman days, they would draw that on walls. 
[01:37:00]  Why him not in first class?  And two asphalt, an asphalt DJ is getting away with it.  Do you have sets, basic standard sets in your dreams?  Because I have about three houses that I'm always in.  And there's one old house that I used to live in, that is constantly in my dream, a neighborhood,  and another old house.  And then one that I have no idea where it came from, and it's like a strip mall with  a bar in it.  It's like a basic, like a studio back lot for my dreams. 
[01:37:30]  They're constant.  My sex dreams always have a weird set.  But it's like this place, and there's all these, like, steps, and there's steam all around,  and I'm wearing a towel.  There's a bunch of other linen towels.  That's dreamy.  I purposely stopped whacking off, because the wet dreams are absolutely amazing.  But you have to let it build up for a good week or so.  Oh, shoot.  Working with clam chowder on your leg. 
[01:38:00]  Stalker, Pat, anything else?  Yeah, I've even gotten dressed in my sleep and went back to bed and woke up in my clothes.  That's happened to me a few times.  You know, you're probably being abducted, Patty, by aliens.  Oh, that's true.  They could be abducting you.  You do have that alien body.  They think you're a grasshopper human morph.  Yeah, not only that, but I listen to the show while I sleep.  I have it on all night, and you play this cell phone that annoys me.  I get up to answer my phone, and no one's there, and I'm like, hello? 
[01:38:30]  Hello?  That could be any time of the day for you.  Because I think the phone is ringing.  Who's calling you?  And one time you planned a problem where I heard, Patty.  I ran out to my door to see who was calling me.  I really thought somebody was looking for me.  Who's killing?  Someone was calling me.  Patty's best friend is sorry.  Wrong number.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Patty.  That was pretty riveting, though.  So, Patty, what will normally happen?  Like, will you get up?  Will you walk around?  Or what will you do? 
[01:39:00]  I do, but I don't remember doing it until I come to her.  Hey, Patty, happy 50th birthday, all right?  There you go.  Hey, Patty, when's your birthday?  Tomorrow.  Yeah, and no, on Saturday, somebody's taking me out to some places.  Where?  But they don't tell me where places are.  Patty, where are you going?  Oh, they better be taking you to some strip club.  They better.  I hope it is.  Well, they said they're going to take a lot of pictures and stuff.  Yeah, you're going to some kind of strip club.  You're going to go to that strip club?  I don't know.  They have no concept. 
[01:39:30]  It's a surprise.  That strip club site that I go to where the guys are dancing naked in front of the women  and the girls are blowing them, it's the hottest site on the neck because it's real  bachelorette and stuff parties.  You can tell it's a real scene shot.  Wow.  And there's, like, these male dancers.  And they say it's a fetish, naked men with women with clothing.  Like, there's something about the women in the clothing that's just inappropriate.  Yeah.  But these girls, these guys will hold up a towel and the girls will blow the male stripper.  It's the hottest site on the net because they're regular chicks. 
[01:40:00]  I saw a tape of that, a DVD of that.  Dude, how high is that, man?  Yeah, it's amazing.  Because they're not porn girls.  They're regular girls who just get really nasty and lick whipped cream off the mules.  Yep.  It's like, these are regular chicks.  I've had sex dreams before.  What's that, Patty?  I've had sex dreams before.  Oh, you did?  You've had sex dreams before?  Yeah, and then I wake up with the sensations and everything.  With the sensations.  She makes it sound so unhot.  Let's hear one of your sex dreams, Patty. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, Patty, what happened?  Oh, God.  One time I dreamt it was Homer Tuesday.  And I couldn't imagine myself doing that, but I did in my sleep.  You know, I dreamt about it.  Who were you giving a BJ to?  I don't know.  I don't remember.  Lexington Steel.  All I know is that I woke up and, like, did I do that?  You know?  Oh, so you blew a guy in your dream?  Yeah, but I don't, I can't imagine myself doing that in real life. 
[01:41:00]  Somewhere some guy was having a nightmare.  Yeah, that someone dropped a little flecks of white stuff into his pubes and he realized  they were chickleteeth.  I woke up like, I dreamt I was being blown by an ant.  Yeah, somebody photoshopped me as an ant in a wheelchair saying, what if Patty and Fred  got together and you see this big ant in a wheelchair?  Wow, what other photoshops do they do?  That's enough.  Anyway, Anthony, let's move on here. 
[01:41:30]  I believe you can talk to dead people in your sleep.  We just did.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  The reason for the hard-on at night, your brain has a defense mechanism.  When you get a hard-on at night, it's very difficult to fall off the bed.  That's all I got.  I don't give him that.  That's not bad.  A little kickstand.  You know, for a minute there, I'm actually listening to this idiot and going, well, maybe  he's, wait.  Defense mechanism.  Yeah.  Paul from New York. 
[01:42:00]  Hey, first of all, all those dreams you guys just talked about, Howard Stern just called  and said he invented all those, so you guys got to give him that.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  I was dreaming back when I was a kid.  Tell him, Fred, I guess.  Hey, Opie and Jim, the thing you guys talked about, the night paralysis.  Yeah.  I saw a thing about it on Discovery Channel.  Now, you guys think that you can see and then finally you kind of just pop into physicality,  like you could finally move your arms and legs, right?  Right.  They did a thing.  They have a camera over the top of the people and they're showing them and you can see them 
[01:42:30]  physically struggling, like squirming like a little worm, but their eyes are closed.  And then at the moment they kind of pop and their arms and legs are able to move, their  eyes open, too.  Their eyes aren't open.  And they interview the doctors, you know, like sleep disorder guys, and they said your  subconscious is telling you what you should be seeing, your natural.  Ah, so you're actually dreaming.  Okay.  Imagining you're seeing the room and that you're laying there and you're looking around,  but you're actually still asleep with your eyes shut.  I hate you, Paul. 
[01:43:00]  That's pretty cool.  That's creepy.  Imagine you're looking down at your own mobile legs, your own paralyzed arms.  Wow.  That's great.  That makes sense.  It's usually dark, though, so I don't even know.  For me, it's not the eyes being open.  It's the sensation of being awake.  Because I am aware, I'm saying wake up, move.  I'm not unaware of my situation.  I'm aware that I'm in bed.  I'm aware that I can't move.  I'm saying move, and I can't move in bed.  And when I wake up, there's no transition like, oh, that was different.  It's a very smooth transition to, yes, I am awake, and I knew I was trying to wake up. 
[01:43:30]  You'll have those situations sometimes where you're dreaming, you're in a bad situation,  and then you do what we just spoke about.  You wake up and go, oh, my God, thank God I'm awake, and you're still not awake.  Yeah.  You're still dreaming, but now you think you woke up.  So now anything else that happens really freaks you out because you think you're awake.  You ever set your alarm clock and then grab the guy with the hat, and then he comes back,  and you can't run up the steps because there's goop of them?  I mean, here's the worst part about this thing, guys. 
[01:44:00]  This sleep door is the sort of thing.  They were analyzing these guys, and as soon as they pop out of their sleep,  they talk to them and interview them and what they had.  I think the only thing worse about them being in sleep paralysis is waking up to a 70-year-old Jewish man  in a white coat with a notebook.  Asking you questions.  I'm going to ask you a couple of questions.  I want them answered immediately.  I'm a doctor, you idiot.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  Hi, Angel.  That was very interesting.  Cliff in Oklahoma.  Go ahead.  What's happening, boys?  What up, Cliff?  Hey, talking about these dreams, I drive a truck, of course,  and it seems like every time I have a dream where I'm late with a load, something happens. 
[01:44:30]  I'm either stuck in traffic or my truck won't move or whatever.  See, it's the same thing, that stress and the anxiety.  You're going to get fired if you don't drop off your payload.  Exactly.  Is it a payload?  I don't know.  I'm sure.  You know, cops will dream, I've heard this,  that they shoot and the bolt just kind of comes out in slow motion or just drops.  Oh, I've had situations where I'm dreaming and I'm in a situation where there's somebody  breaking into the house, one of those houses that I'm always in, 
[01:45:00]  and I go reach for the gun and for some reason the bullets don't fit.  I can't find the bullets.  They're too small for the chamber.  The clip doesn't fit in the gun.  It's always some problem.  And if it ever does work, you fire the gun, it doesn't fire.  The bullet just, like, yeah, falls out of the barrel.  You miss.  Or if you're trying to run, you can't run.  Oh, the running thing is just, yeah, that's legendary. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, you can't throw your fist.  Your fist won't go around.  Yeah, you can't throw a punch.  Your punch goes in slow motion.  I hate the non, the running thing that you can't run.  You're trying to run away from something and you're just straining.  You're on the ground, like, trying to crawl.  You're pulling yourself.  The next morning, every time I have one of these dreams, my wife tells me,  you know, I've got a 10-speed transmission, so I do a lot of shifting.  And the next morning, she'll tell me that I was moving my arm at night, shifting gears in bed.  That's probably what she wants to believe you were doing. 
[01:46:00]  I think we all know what you were doing.  She's like, why were you mumbling Jean Benet and shifting?  Hey, Jimmy, they re-ran Last Comic this weekend.  I saw you on there.  I loved it, man.  I saw you and Voss and Patrice, man.  It was great.  Thank you, mister.  Awesome.  Oh, this guy, guys.  All right, Cliff, thank you.  Freddie from Philly has horrible dreams.  I see red eyes, and I always think someone's hanging over me about to tear my throat out.  I try to talk and end up sounding like Terry Shifo. 
[01:46:30]  Imagine that.  You see those beady red eyes staring at you?  You don't want to open your eyes because there's going to be a face three inches away from yours.  Red eyes like a demon.  Like a demon's eyes.  Creepy stuff.  It's, yeah.  Sleep is just weird.  But then it all, once you wake up, it's all better.  I know what?  I consider myself a pretty brave person, but then when I go to sleep, I get,  and the whole place is dark, and you're running around your apartment all day long, 
[01:47:00]  upstairs, downstairs, outdoors, indoors, but something, I don't know what happens.  When you're starting to fall asleep, your bravery goes away,  and you don't even want, you know you want to go upstairs for something.  Yeah.  You know, you've already been sleeping for a while, and you're like,  no fucking way am I going up there now.  It's creepy up there.  Now you're home that you know very well just is very creepy.  I hate hearing sounds in the house.  I'm a big scaredy cat in the house.  I'm just like, forget about it. 
[01:47:30]  Give me a weapon.  If it was daylight, you would run right upstairs, and downstairs, and what have you.  It's daylight.  Monsters aren't out in the daytime, stupid.  It's so weird.  We're like, we're adults.  I don't believe that it's a random firing of, one of these random firings.  They say, well, that doesn't really mean anything,  because people have too many similar experiences and dreams.  Like, too many people, like truckers, are afraid of not getting this load delivered.  You dream about work.  We all dream about the same basic fears.  Yeah.  It's got to be an instinct thing, or if we're all connected on some weird energy level.  Yeah.  It's not just some random firing. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, because there's too many similarities.  People have the same types of dreams.  It's got to come from somewhere.  One time Danny dreamed that Nathaniel actually had, like, an assault on the media  that everyone remembered and bypassed his awful one.  Nathaniel dreamed that Danny one time ran with a sign  and got the whole fucking word in the camera.  That's horrible.  Oh, God, the phones have exploded.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  He's a regular caller.  Go ahead, Max.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  You just made people drink on the O&A drinking game, by the way.  Oh, really?  Yeah, every time you say the phones have exploded, people have to drink. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, my God.  So it's very early, but people are drinking.  All right.  Well, have they?  Cool.  Yes, they have.  The phones are very active right now.  That's right.  Spit your drink out.  All right.  Go ahead, Max.  Okay, I got a dream.  Maybe Jimmy can interpret this one, since he was over there in the Gulf.  I was in the Gulf War in 90 and 91, and I got shot in the leg.  And recently, I've been having this dream where I get shot in the leg.  They call in for a medevac.  The chopper lands, picks us up, puts us on, flies us out. 
[01:49:00]  And instead of landing at a medevac place, it lands in front of the Addison Improv between  the 16th, 17th, and 18th.  You guys have a good one.  That was a damn good one.  That was good.  I didn't see it coming.  I thought he was going somewhere, but I wasn't sure it was a Jimmy plug.  I thought he was going to say he landed in front of enemy territory or something.  Who cares?  My Dallas Improv Day, if you guys want to come, come.  But if not, it's not about that.  It's about fun.  Anthony, on whackbag.com, they have a whole thread on sayings overused on the show. 
[01:49:30]  Yep.  Oh.  It starts with, this thing is taking on a life of its own.  Oh, okay.  That's another Opie standard.  I'm sure there's a lot that I do.  Let's see.  How about this one?  Voss is going to be on the show today.  I'm tired of hearing that one.  Oh.  That's just a piece of something.  That doesn't count.  Let's see.  You know, someone's got to go through these so we can get the better ones.  Yeah.  I think somebody ought to do that. 
[01:50:00]  Instead of standing around in that room.  Let's see.  Get through that right now.  Oh, here's the one you just said, Anthony.  The phones have just exploded.  Yep.  How about little Jimmy saying, thanks for calling the program?  Well, that's kind of being funny.  Yeah, it's not really an overused saying, sir.  And what's wrong with saying that?  If I want to thank someone for calling the Images in the morning program, I thank them.  Another overused phrase.  Ricky, I didn't order this.  Oh, let's see.  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  Whatever.  Yeah, something.  Got to go through it.  Get the really good ones.  Yeah.  They only have a few?  Well, yeah.  And then they comment about the ones.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that sig pic.  Oh, that's great.  What is it?  I like that one.  A puffy vag.  It's a puffy vag.  You would love this one, Jimmy.  It's a puffy vag.  And it's an animated picture.  So it's the guy's finger on her vag.  He's got his index finger on the slit and the thumb on the side and the middle finger on the 
[01:51:00]  other side.  And she's wearing panties.  And he's squeezing it gently.  I believe she is.  Squeezing it gently and pushing down his index finger.  Oh, really?  There's one that goes around called Hamburger.  It's probably the sexiest girl I've ever seen.  She's, uh, her vag is really fat.  But, I mean, it's beautiful.  Why is it called Hamburger?  Because they're saying it looks like hamburger meat.  It's so thick.  Oh, God.  You see the hand.  And I'm sure a lot of you know what it is.  The fingers are squeezing it and kneading it.  And it's like, brr, back in.  It's like squeezing a balloon.  But it doesn't, it's not a dangly one.  It's just a fat, young-looking one. 
[01:51:30]  Wow.  Like, 23.  Yeech.  Dude.  That's too much going on.  It's, it's, it's like, I almost get, like, the saliva glands almost activate when I see it.  And somebody directed me.  She's actually, it's actually Nacho.  Uh, Nacho.  And she's actually on his website.  I have the whole name.  Her name is Nacho?  His name, the guy.  He's a brute.  He's probably the best, the best bang in the business.  He's an animal.  Huh.  All right.  Others, Anthony.  Is one of the interns working on this to get the better ones?  Someone?  Okay.  Are you insane?  I know I say that a lot.  Also, uh, who is, is this? 
[01:52:00]  Who is, is this?  I don't think that's overused.  No.  I love it every time it's used.  Who is, is this?  Punching out.  Yeah, punching out.  The listeners, see?  The listeners.  Right.  They abuse.  Yep.  Quit abusing things like it's Guantanamo Bay.  Jimmy, uh, uses the phrase, that's what's wrong with the left.  Wait, I don't say that a lot.  Oh my God, you do.  Actually, that's why the left stinks.  Right.  All right, whatever.  I did it correct.  Tuna tits, angel eyes. 
[01:52:30]  More listeners.  I don't care.  Did you just fart?  I agree.  That one is overused.  Yes, it is.  Let it go.  Breathe in like men.  Opie's saying definitely versus definitely.  Definitely.  I've never heard that one.  Wow, that's a new one for me.  All right.  Now I'm going to have to be, uh, not saying that word anymore.  Definitely.  All right, there's so many more, but, uh.  Yeah, we'll have one of the guys go through it.  He's going through it.  I want to do it now.  That's their job.  Do something.  Freakshow, the trucker. 
[01:53:00]  What's up, Freakshow?  Hey, I had a dream.  I was actually in prison.  While I was in prison, I was dreaming.  All right, slow down.  Slow down.  Why were you in prison?  Uh, I was in prison for, uh, aggravated battery, home invasion, a few other things.  Aggravated battery and home invasion?  For real or in your dream?  Now, in my dream.  Wait, wait.  No, we want more info on your home invasion.  What'd you do?  I used to rob a dope man.  You used to rob a dope man? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, that was me and another guy's thing.  We would go in and rob the dope man.  And the dope man would call the cops on you and have you arrested for robbing his dope?  No, actually, one time it was the dope man's mother.  Ah, see?  I knew it wasn't just the dope man.  Um, you, so you went to the dope man's mother's house?  No, he lived with his mother.  Uh-huh.  And we robbed him and she called the cops.  How much time did you do?  Eight years.  Oh, eight years.  What did you get out of his house? 
[01:54:00]  Uh, dope and money.  Were you, are you an addict or were you getting high?  At that time, I was an addict, yes.  You're a ballsy dude, though, going after the dealers.  I mean, that's smart, but it's also, most of them are armed, so it's a lot of balls to that.  That's, you know, I was a stupid person way back when.  And, you know, when you're an addict, you'll do just about anything for what you have to have.  So what really happens in prison?  Well, you know, you're nearly like they say.  I mean, as far as, like, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the gi, the rape, the prison rape.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Almost never.  I didn't know.  See, no one ever has been raped in prison.  We've talked to a lot of prisoners over the years.  Not one of them has said anything.  Not one guy's getting admitted.  No, there's too many active homosexuals in there.  Now, there are a few crazy people.  In fact, there was this one guy named Tattoo.  He was the I-57 shooter out of Chicago.  He was a great, big, mean, tattooed homosexual.  But this guy would knock you out and suck your dick.  He didn't, he didn't want to fuck you.  He wanted to suck your dick.  He sounds like a good egg.  Why would he have to knock you out?  Why not do you say, hey, Tattoo, thanks. 
[01:55:00]  He was just a big, mean, nuts bastard.  His deal was to knock you out, and then if that's not bad enough, he's sucking you off.  But you can't even get hard and fed him.  You're coming to, like, all groggy.  Like, what the fuck?  Why?  I thought it was bad enough that I just lost all my teeth.  Jesus.  Little guy in a white suit sucking your dick.  No, but there's so many active homosexuals in there that, you know, there are just sexual predators  that rape these young kids when they come in. 
[01:55:30]  But it's so rare that there are too many, you know, gay guys that they're just giving it out.  You know, there's not much need for rape.  All right.  So you went to jail for eight years for this, and now you dream about it?  Okay.  I was in prison having a dream that I was in prison.  Now, when I woke up, my eyes were still closed.  And I thought, boy, that was a bad dream.  I dreamt I was in prison.  And I opened my eyes, and I was really there.  Oh, that's got to stink.  Because for that split second, you're thinking, oh, that was just a dream.  Wait a minute.  It was awful. 
[01:56:00]  Hey, dude, what's it like when you dream that you're on the outside when you're in jail?  Do you have dreams of, like, today's my release date and stuff?  No, not too much of that.  But I still dream now and then.  I'm getting ready to go back.  How long ago did you get out?  I've been out since 97, I guess.  Okay.  You guys remember me?  My wife just got out of prison.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He did cool.  What did your wife do?  Criminal Sexual Assault to a minor.  Did you ever send me pictures?  Yes, I did.  I do know this guy.  I don't remember the pictures.  What does that mean, Jimmy? 
[01:56:30]  Nothing, nothing nasty.  It's like, hey, I called the show.  But I do remember talking to this guy.  He's cool.  A couple weeks ago, I was trying to get Patty to come to Kentucky and have sex with me and my wife.  Did she go for it?  Of course not.  No, that was when she said, I didn't want to go to Kentucky.  Yeah, she had sex with a dog, but not come to Kentucky.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, I'm out of here, guys.  Great show.  Thanks, man.  There he goes.  Freak show.  I remember him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember the call.  Let's go to Chris in Nolens.  Chris?  Nolens.  Yeah. 
[01:57:00]  What's up?  I'm on the radio?  Yes, you are.  Oh, damn, man.  I was falling asleep here.  Hey, I have one really messed up dream, and that's me being in Miami.  I used to live there.  And I'll be walking down these gutters and alleys, and then all of a sudden, these disco lights  will come on, and there'll be a rotten corpse disco.  And there's people's legs cracking in half, and bodies falling down, and that's my real 
[01:57:30]  messed up dream right there.  All right.  Right there.  Is there a broken limbs?  Is there a fat kid going for a football, and his leg snaps off, and he cries?  Yeah, let's play another remix as we go to break.  People can't dance, because this faggot's asking for his hand to be held.  Look, we just want to do a little Donna Summers move.  Hold my hand, man.  Look, you're fucking up the disco.  Don't let go.  My knee, man.  I just want to do the shuffle.  How about one more?  Andy the Trucker. 
[01:58:00]  Go ahead, Andy.  Hey, my big thing that I've had a problem with is, you can have a nightmare.  Wake up from it and go right back in the nightmare when you close your eyes again, but you can  have a great dream with a naked chick in your bed.  Wake up, and you can't get back into it, no matter how hard you try.  And when you first go back to sleep, you still think you're going to get right back into it,  but all of a sudden, the naked chick's not in the house anymore or something, or all of  a sudden, she starts getting older, or some crazy thing starts happening, and you're  telling yourself, no, no, go back, go back. 
[01:58:30]  Exactly.  It's at that point that I'm going, I don't want to wake up yet.  Stop this.  I remember one time, I had this dream, well, actually, one time I had it, where a friend  of mine was sick, and he comes to me in the middle of the night, and I'm laying in bed,  and he comes up, and he goes, hey, man, I just came, I wanted to say goodbye.  And I'm like, why do you want to say goodbye?  And he's like, you know, because.  Be more funny, you fucking asshole. 
[01:59:00]  You're wasting my time.  That's not, that's mean, though.  Liddy's never mean.  This is the, uh, the mean Liddy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  People, uh, we've gotten some of the whack bag, um, submissions for phrases that are overused  on the show, and some people, I think I love how threads on message boards start as one  thing and then just mutate into something else. 
[01:59:30]  People don't get the topic.  They're too stupid to actually get the topic, and they start adding things on.  Um, these should just be words that are overused, or, or phrases that are overused.  I think we, uh, overuse the word the a lot.  The.  The, uh, they say the so many times every day.  But, uh, something like, the phones are exploding, they could say that because it's every day, whether,  you know, you use it or not, or like it or not, you know, that, that would fall into  that category.  Um, that old gag, yeah, we use that. 
[02:00:00]  Um, but then here comes Patrick.  What?  That doesn't make sense.  Uh, any, uh, dumb name for Norton?  Uh, meat tits, angel eyes, sugar bear.  I agree.  Those are hurtful.  But that isn't us.  How do you hate the yuck sounds?  Yeah, yuck.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Uh, Opie saying, oh my God?  Holy S?  I say holy S a lot. 
[02:00:30]  That goes back to our days on commercial radio.  I haven't got out of that habit yet.  I'm sorry.  I'll start trying to say holy shit.  There you go.  Atta boy.  Feels good.  Or crap if you don't want to curse.  Crap.  Holy crap.  Okay.  All right.  Uh, Opie saying shock, shock, shock, shock, shock.  That's just, that's our new thing.  He goes, I want to reach through the fucking radio and punch him in the fucking face when  he does that.  We all do it though.  And that's not what I meant when I wrote that.  And hold on.  Hold on.  That's the reason we do it.  To be annoying.  Because that's how it feels to us.  That's the one that doesn't get it. 
[02:01:00]  Every time we see shock jocks next to our names, it's like, that's what we're trying  to convey.  Convey, thanks.  Convey to you guys how awful it is.  And this one, not you.  I don't, it does not get over you.  So now people are just looking for things to write in our expressions.  Now they look and go, okay, they use that.  Let me write this down so I can contribute.  Not you doesn't get used that often, actually.  No.  And some of the things that are now stale enough to go.  Any Peterson jokes?  Come on.  If it makes sense, you use it.  We have, we did do too many of them at one point. 
[02:01:30]  Rape jokes?  When are rape jokes?  I just passed over a clever little Peterson instant feedback that I didn't read.  All right.  It was about some guy that said that he dreams that he took his wife's corpse out in a boat  and dumped it out.  It was Scott from Modesto.  It was very funny.  And I got a chuckle from it.  Thank you.  I got to interrupt you guys for one second because Lady Di wants to say hi.  Oh, Lady Di?  There's that yuck.  How's it going, guys? 
[02:02:00]  Hey, what's up?  Oh, well, you know.  All right.  She said hi.  Oh, well, you know.  No, we don't.  And we don't care.  Yellow discipline jokes, dropping a log on your chest jokes.  First of all, how about try that as a lifestyle and see how overplayed it gets.  And plugging your gig out of the blue.  I think this guy has a problem with Norton.  I think that's his guy's problem.  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.  Why don't you just have the courage to come out and say, I have a problem with Norton,  and stop trying to get around it by just using all the things like that stupid.  The only person on this show that no one has a problem with is him. 
[02:02:30]  What?  Well, Anthony, you.  Oh, people have problems with me.  Believe me.  I read some things.  Yeah.  I read things.  They have a problem with me.  They have a problem with Jimmy.  I read things.  And I got my crutches.  I listen to the replays, and I go, oh, stop saying that.  Like, my latest one is, I say Jesus Christ all the time.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  Enough with the Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  You know, it's part of this moral glaucoma.  Right.  Taking the Lord's name in favor.  You know, Jesus Christ. 
[02:03:00]  But you lowercase it.  Because he uppercased stupid things.  And the wow explanation, especially you put the wow sticker on your car.  Yeah, because you don't need to explain that to new listeners.  Just think they should put a sticker on their car, and don't tell them why.  You have to explain that, stupid ass.  Well, and I want.  New listeners all the time.  I want a promo that just does all that for us.  That would be really nice.  Because, yeah, obviously you just go and get a wow sticker, throw it on your car,  and if the ladies see the wow sticker, they may flash you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:03:30]  That could be done in a commercial instead of some of those awful, awful promos they run for, like, jazz stations and stuff.  What?  How about this?  Using the adjective awful.  Although, in today's world, I can't blame anyone for using it over and over.  Or also, you stink.  You stink.  And awful.  I don't like you stink.  All right.  Awful.  Ralphie Mays outside the studio.  Ooh.  Oh, yes?  The guy who's coming today.  He's a good egg.  He sure is.  He's got a pal with him, right?  Yeah.  Now what are we going to do? 
[02:04:00]  We're short on mics.  They're going to have to share a mic.  Oh, boy.  Or a handheld.  That works well with Ralphie Mays.  Every one gets in on that side.  They've got to figure out the mic thing, because honestly, do I say honestly a lot?  Probably.  Now we're all going to be self-conscious.  It takes us out of our game.  Everything's not ready to go when we step into here.  You don't smell good.  Hey, Anthony.  You told him.  Before we go to the break here, let's play a couple more Bob Kelly remixes.  Mm-hmm.  The listener sent in a bunch of these things, and we want to try them out live on the show.  So, Bob Kelly breaking his knee, playing football. 
[02:04:30]  You've heard the audio by now.  If you haven't, go to opanthony.com.  Let's try this from JM.  I have no idea how good it is.  Tell me when to stop if you hate it, Ann, all right?  Jim!  He's down.  You're way down.  I snapped my knee, man. 
[02:05:00]  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my fucking knee, man.  This is fucking horrendous.  On every level.  Send that shit to Bob and Tom.  On every level, that's horrible.  This is awful.  The music stinks.  You can't hear either the song or the audio that's being played with it.  And what? 
[02:05:30]  Because the guy said broken leg at the beginning of the song?  Guys, calm down.  Guy banked on that?  Fucking brutal.  Calm down.  The guy's trying.  Yeah, good for him.  Send in a camel toe song.  We'll all play that and elbow each other good nature to be in Indianapolis.  That blew.  That was really bad.  There's a camel toe song?  Oh, it's fucking awful.  Really?  Yeah, I know.  I said it again.  Now I'm all self-conscious.  See, aren't we?  Jesus Christ.  Now we're all just going to be quiet. 
[02:06:00]  You know the torture I go through every day before I attempt to say the word put?  Because of these asses.  We see it.  You'll go like, put.  Stop what you're saying and say, put.  And I was listening to some old tapes of us that have to be six, seven years ago, and I  was saying, what, what, what, what, and no one ever noticed.  But one asshat had been fucking pointed out to me.  Now it's a torture every day.  I have to think about it before I actually say the word.  Want to try another one here, Anthony? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, because that's stunk.  All right.  Yeah, we got to leave with a good one.  And here's Dan in Pennsylvania.  I love that.  See?  Come on, see.  Get ready to fuck! 
[02:07:00]  You fucker, fucker!  You fucker!  Don't you fucking look at me!  Oh, boy.  That was Bob Kelly meets Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet.  Blue Velvet.  That should be called That Was Awful Remix.  Horrible. 
[02:07:30]  Follows Awful Remix.  That was really bad.  Come on, people!  This is a great bit.  Step it up!  All right, let's try this one.  Bob Kelly meets Keitel from Reservoir Dogs.  We got a couple of these.  This one's from Ray from Deer Park.  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  Hold on, buddy boy.  I broke my knee, man.  Oh, excuse me.  I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine.  I broke my knee, man.  Oh, are you a doctor?  Are you a doctor?  I broke my knee.  I broke my knee, man.  Answer me, please. 
[02:08:00]  Are you a doctor?  No, dude.  Okay.  So you admit you don't know what you're talking about.  So, if you're through giving me your amateur opinion...  I broke it, dude.  I felt it crack.  And?  You're gonna be okay.  I broke my knee.  I broke my knee, man.  You're gonna be okay.  Say the goddamn right.  You're gonna be okay.  Ah, it's fucked up.  Who's a tough guy?  Who's a tough guy?  Come on.  Who's a tough guy? 
[02:08:30]  You're a tough guy.  You're a fucking tough guy.  I just want you to relax now.  Okay?  You're not gonna fucking die.  You're gonna be fine.  When Joe gets here,  I'll make you 100% again.  I'm in so much pain, man.  I can't do anything for you.  I'm in so much pain, dude.  Hey!  Just catch that shit.  Right now.  You're hurt.  You're hurt real fucking bad.  But you ain't dying.  I gotta squeeze something. 
[02:09:00]  Go ahead and be scared.  You've been brave enough for one day.  Almost.  That was good.  It started really good.  I thought it started right there.  Yeah, it started good  and then petered out.  Yeah.  I gotta interrupt this for one second.  Lady Di wants to say hi.  Oh, what happened?  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  I'm right here.  You want to say hi?  Yes, I do.  Say hi.  Hello.  All right.  There's one more.  That will never get old, by the way.  If you do that 50 times, 
[02:09:30]  I'll enjoy it every time.  Fucking sea turtle calling in.  There's one more.  Bob Kelly stars in Reservoir Dogs again.  This one was done by Chemistry.  Oh, okay.  Who's always good for a good one?  I broke my knee, dude.  I broke it, dude.  I felt it crack.  I'm in so much pain, man.  Can't do anything for you.  And when Joe gets here,  should be any time now.  He's gonna help you out.  He's gonna take care of you.  Come on.  Okay?  Just sit here.  We're gonna wait for you. 
[02:10:00]  Hold my hand, man.  I gotta squeeze something.  I broke that fucking thing.  I broke it.  You're not gonna fucking die.  You're gonna be fine.  Joe gets here.  I'll make you 100% again.  You're not gonna fucking die, kid.  All right?  Listen to me.  Fuck.  You're gonna be fine.  Fuck.  The kneecap is the most painful area 
[02:10:30]  a guy can get shot in.  Fuck me, man.  Shit.  But it takes a long time to die for me.  It's been back.  I'm talking days.  You're gonna wish you were dead.  But it takes days to die for your wound.  God damn, man.  Ah!  Ah!  What the fuck?  All right.  That was good.  That one was put together well.  Chemistry!  How do you get Keitel saying kneecap  instead of belly?  Yeah, I started thinking about that  and I believe he said  the kneecap and the belly 
[02:11:00]  are the two most painful places  to be shot.  I think.  Can't recall.  But that's Keitel saying kneecap.  Yeah.  What a great movie.  All right.  Oh, hold on a minute.  Before we go to break,  Lady Di wants to say hi.  Lady Di!  Yes?  What's the matter?  Don't you want to talk to me?  You haven't been calling the show.  What's going on?  Did you want to say hi?  You know, I already said hello.  You're gonna...  Oh.  All right.  She had you there. 
[02:11:30]  Maybe she's on to the room.  She's a smart one now.  Maybe you're getting smarter.  I don't know.  All right, quick break  and then we'll get Ralphie May  into the mix here, okay?  Maybe a coffee for all of us  or something?  What do you think?  How much coffee is going on  in this place?  There's always coffee going on.  There's constantly someone  going on a coffee run.  Get Travis in here.  Travis has run how many times?  I want him to be honest.  He's got such a good body.  For more coffee?  This is hilarious.  No, what I wanted to ask Travis 
[02:12:00]  and I want him to be honest  is...  What happened?  Oh, no, it's okay.  We'll ask him when we get back.  I want to know how many times  he has to go to Starbucks  in one four-hour period.  Between that and Rock and Roll Deli,  they all think he's nuts  because he goes there every day  for several orders.  Yeah.  You know, and then they thought  Ricky was completely nuts.  I know he goes for coffee  for me two to three times a day.  Two or three different...  That's just for my orders.  And then there's...  What happened?  I was doing the same thing. 
[02:12:30]  What happened?  I didn't even notice.  What happened?  Ben is just such a self-conscious  broken man.  He's standing there  and he's got like  under his left nepple  his shirt pocket  a big red circle  and he's just trying to  cover it up with his little  T-Rex arms  and he's so self-conscious  and I'm just looking at him  and he's like, what?  I was staring at his mule.  Oh, no.  He looked over all...  Oh, he didn't know  what to cover.  Oh, that's funny.  He didn't know  what to cover the stain  on his shirt  or his huge hog.  Do I cover the stain 
[02:13:00]  or this gift  that God has given me?  And I forgot to tell you  we went to the, you know,  the grand opening  of the New York facility  for Exxam.  Yes, yes.  And Earl wanted to go  because he wanted to see  Wynton Marsalis.  Earl.  Black Earl.  Good friend of ours.  And we all went  to Starbucks afterwards.  And Jimmy and I  were obsessed  with getting a picture  of his package  in the middle of Starbucks.  Earl.  It is the best gag  because we both  have our digital cameras 
[02:13:30]  and we're just trying  to get a picture  of Earl's crotch.  But then he's on to us.  So he's in a packed Starbucks  with his camera  because now he thinks  he's Ansel Adams.  Yeah, he walks around  with a camera  all the time now.  Like, not a digital camera,  a regular big  35mm film camera.  He's a black guy  and he'll call me  all the time  and I say black guy  because of what  I'm about to say  and he'll call  from time to time  and go,  yeah, I'm heading  into the city  to do some shooting.  Oh, shooting.  Well.  And I've got to remember  this is his new hobby.  He takes black and white  photos wherever he's going. 
[02:14:00]  It's black and white  because anything  in black and white  is art.  Hence Ansel Adams.  Thank you.  Artistic.  Thank you.  Professor will be with you.  Thank you.  If you take pictures in color,  they're just pictures.  Right.  But in black and white,  now you can pass it off as  look at this shot  of this building.  Right.  Meanwhile,  it could just be a tourist  taking a picture  of a building  but if it's done  in black and white  and you look up at it  and snap it,  now it's some great  piece of artwork.  I guarantee you  Earl's pictures  are dog shit.  Oh, I bet they're just 
[02:14:30]  terrible.  They're boring.  Look, it's a banana  but black and white  without the fun colors  that make it interesting.  So he's got his camera  strapped  so his camera  strategically  is right  at his crotch.  Okay?  And it's black  and it's wide  so it almost looks like  His crotch?  Well, that's what  we're trying to figure out  so then  I'm trying to take  like shots  in the middle  of this packed Starbucks.  Everyone is watching  us at this point  and he's covering up  uncomfortably  with his two hands 
[02:15:00]  like this  and he doesn't move  his hands.  Why do you want  to do that?  Right, right.  And then we're guessing  really loudly  in Starbucks  what he's packing  and I'm like  I think he's packing  like five  and Norton's like  I think it's like  discolored  and we're just  trying to figure out  what he has.  Bent and ashy  and thin.  Right.  I said that he had  some kind of  pink freckle on it.  Oh!  That's his ego.  So then  Jimmy's like  I go  no, seriously Earl  I just want a picture  of you and Jimmy  I don't have a picture  of you guys  and so obviously 
[02:15:30]  Jimmy's playing along  perfectly  and Jimmy's like  come on Earl  just put, put, put  your arm around me  and finally Earl  goes for it  and I go click  so I got a shot  of his crotch.  Now we're spending  the next five minutes  in this packed  Starbucks  studying the shot  I got  like zooming in  and out  trying to figure out  if he has any action  down there at all.  Nothing.  He's a black disgrace.  He's nothing.  He's the only thing  he has  he has an Asian 
[02:16:00]  crotch area.  There's not  there's no  no outline  of a cock at all.  You should be ashamed  of yourself.  And I think he is.  It was just  silly fun.  That's why he doesn't  like into chicks  or whatever  because he's probably  ashamed  that he has a small  awful dick.  He probably has  like a large head  but on his little  thin shaft  it just looks wrong  like a flower  that's wilting.  Jesus.  Lady Di wants to say hi.  Lady Di.  Yes.  What's going on?  Why do you keep  on hanging up on me? 
[02:16:30]  I hope he stopped that.  Do you want to say  hi or not?  Well I already said hello.  What a waste.  A waste of basic  chemicals  that make up  the human body.  Getting a lot  of instant feedback  is a lot of people  saying if you're  playing chemistry  stuff today  you've got to play  his Goodfellas remix.  Oh yes.  Want to play that  before we go to break?  Sure.  Well we're going to  play it.  Chemistry did Bob Kelly  and Goodfellas. 
[02:17:00]  What?  You're absolutely  right Ant.  I edited out  stomach.  You've got to play  my Goodfellas 1 too.  Oh okay.  Forget Aristotle.  Oh well.  Socrates.  More trivia.  Here comes  Professor Anthony.  More just movie trivia.  I know but it's more  it has something to do  with the fact that  you know a little bit  about it.  No it was a tad bit.  Oh was it the knee  and the stomach you mean?  Yeah.  Oh okay.  Yeah chemistry confirmed it.  So here's chemistry's  Goodfellas remix.  Actually this one  is really good. 
[02:17:30]  I did hear this one  before the show  started today.  Check it out.  Yahoo you motherfuckers.  Come on.  I broke my knee man.  I broke my knee man.  All right so we got shot.  What is it a big fucking knee?  Vito get a towel.  Nice fucking game.  I broke my fucking knee dude.  I heard it play game.  Look let him crawl there 
[02:18:00]  like he crawls for the fucking  I broke my knee man.  Fuck.  Don't give me a shit now.  I broke my knee dude.  I'm going to make  a big fucking thing  out of it.  You're a little straight.  Try and make me think  what the fuck I did in.  I'm in so much pain man.  A little fucking ass.  I got a great head.  A little straight.  I love when he goes  call Ben Casey.  Ben Casey.  Make me think about  what I did here.  That's a funny fucking  last night.  Call Ben Casey. 
[02:18:30]  That was it.  I guess everybody knows  that that was Michael  Imperioli.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shot me a foot.  You guys.  Spider.  I thought you said  I thought you said  I'm okay spider.  I thought  no because  I'm alright.  I thought you said  spider I'm alright.  I  Oh Ben Casey.  Great scene man.  You guys Lady Di  wants to say hi.  Lady Di.  What's going on?  Alfie.  Why do you keep  on hanging up on me?  Did you or did you  not want to say hi?  I already said that. 
[02:19:00]  Said what?  Well nothing.  I just wanted to  you know.  What did you say?  I wanted to talk to you guys.  Did you say hi?  You going to hang up  on me again?  No.  You won't say it.  Huh?  You keep calling up  and acting stupid  you won't say it.  I'm going to say hi again.  Yeah.  Anyone else find that funny?  It's kind of funny.  Every time.  Alright.  But she keeps calling.  Alright you guys  Ralphie May is  ready to come in  with uh  who's he bringing in today?  Joey Diaz. 
[02:19:30]  Joey.  Joey's really funny.  And also Laszlo's here  and he brought  some audio  of the new 50 cent  video game.  Oh yeah?  Scream so.  We're getting that  audio together?  Steve.  And we also have the  I can't win with you.  I thought you said  it's a scream.  That's all.  Ben.  What's on your shirt?  Yeah.  Yeah what happened?  Ask middle aged  Jewish woman expression  what is on?  He's a panic.  What happened?  It's an eyeglass cleaner.  Anyone else notice  that Ben's starting  to wear smocks  around the open?  And it still doesn't cover.  It's eyeglass cleaner? 
[02:20:00]  Oh.  Oh he just sprayed you  with eyeglass cleaner Jimmy.  He spritzed me.  He spritzed you.  You're going to have to  be a longer shirt  than that kid.  Ben used to just  wear t-shirts  to work tucked in.  Now he's at the point  where he's wearing smocks.  I guarantee you  Ben's been to doctors.  Look can you just  drain the fluid  out of this bag  a little bit?  Look we can't do  anything.  It's genetics.  You should just be  thankful to whatever  your higher power is.  But they laugh at me.  They point at him.  I try to hide it  with my hands  You know what?  Very self-conscious. 
[02:20:30]  You know something  we haven't talked about  in a really long time.  Ben is a true soldier  of this program  and I'll tell you why.  And I'm not even  trying to make fun of you Ben.  Don't throw him under the bus  or it might hit his cock  and tip over.  When Anthony and I  first moved to New York  Ben was just working  promotions pretty much  just like stuffing envelopes  and doing dumb shit.  And I knew  oh my god  this kid's got something.  And he goes back  like six or seven years  with us right?  But at first  he was doing nothing.  And we wanted to get  this WOW promotion going.  You know where I'm going  with this? 
[02:21:00]  So we wanted to get  the WOW promotion going  so we asked Ben  if he could maybe do  like sticker stops  all over the city.  Do you remember?  So he would take out  the WNEW van with Earl.  And we nicknamed Ben  Gay Ben.  Do you remember this?  Oh my god.  That's right.  We nicknamed Ben  Gay Ben  and it was Black Earl.  So it was like  hey if you want your  WOW stickers  go to Madison Square  Garden Gay Ben  and Black Earl  will be there  handing out  your WOW stickers 
[02:21:30]  to you.  You've got to tell  him why he was  nicknamed Gay Ben.  Yeah why did we  come up with that?  He went into a bar  and it was great.  It was a tunnel  which was a crazy  nightclub here in New York  and it was wasted  out of my mind.  Holy crap I don't even  remember why we named him  He was hammered.  I thought it was cool  to tell you the story.  What a dumb move  that was on my part.  He was hammered  and there was a tranny  there that looked  real hot  and the tranny  had his hand  on Ben's leg  and Ben didn't ask  the tranny to remove  the hand  from the leg.  Well didn't you  end up in a cab  or something with him?  No no we ended up  hanging out with him 
[02:22:00]  and then when I was  with my friend Decker  and when we found out  he said I turned white  and I just didn't know  what to do  but they looked hot.  And he told the story  so we were calling him  Gay Ben.  Like an idiot  I thought it was cool  to tell you guys  and then I just got  destroyed on the air  for months.  Now it's Black Earl  and Lucky Ben.  So that's how we got  his name  that we just started  calling him Gay Ben  as one of our  cool characters  on the show  and this went on  for what  three, four months  easily  and so Earl  and I almost got 
[02:22:30]  killed at Irving Plaza.  Yeah so Ben's out  you know just doing  you know helping us out  with the wow stickers  and stuff  and we're like  hey let's go to the street  Gay Ben  what's going on out there  and you know  obviously Ben's not gay  which is the key  to the story.  Finally  what happened  at Irving Plaza?  I  we  our old program director  it was a Tom Petty concert  and our old program director  Gary really fucked up  and  Q104  I forget what happened  but our van got shook  and people wanted  to kill me in a row  because we were supposed 
[02:23:00]  to give away tickets  and Gary screwed up  on the tickets  and they wanted to kill us  and I was on the phone  with you guys live  it was really bad  yeah they were tipping the van  the van was rocking  and you know Earl  Earl's totally  we didn't know  what the fuck to do  and once again  our listeners know more  about our own lives  than us  of course  Ed is saying that  it wasn't Gay Ben  it was Ben the fag  Ben the fag  was it Ben the fag?  it was Ben the fag  could someone remind me  when my birthday was?  last Friday  these guys know more  than we do about ourselves  so then finally 
[02:23:30]  Ben had to do  the uncomfortable  like pull me aside  in the office  and go uh  yeah I mean  we didn't really know  each other that well  you know he's like  uh dude you know  Ben the fag  I don't want to  you know cause trouble  or anything but  I'm not a fag  I'm not a fag  and it's kind of  getting a little weird  out there  and people think  I'm gay  and they're kind of  hitting on me  and stuff  and now the people  want to punch me  yeah I want to kill them  you think maybe  so tolerant as a society  you know  you think maybe  uh  I don't know  you could call me  something else 
[02:24:00]  just went uh  old Ben Kenobi  now he's Ben the muslim  that's funny  Ben Atta  hey Benny Bin Laden  who's on the show tomorrow  we have a lot of good old stories  good old days  in AEW  god  alright let's uh  Lady Di wants to say hi  Lady Di  why does she keep  stop  no one's hanging up on you  why do you keep screwing around  I'm on a pay phone right now 
[02:24:30]  and I figured I'd just call you guys  you know  to see how you're doing  and everything  I haven't heard you  call us  wait  call us guys  to say what  to say  hi  you're gonna hang up on me  no  is that six  I think so  that's right  fish out more quarters  stupid  can I uh  comment on  a paranoia kid  from Wayne New Jersey  here  emailing over and over again  with something  why are you commenting  on the  whatever  is being played 
[02:25:00]  during commercial breaks  to us  we don't listen to them  he's commenting on  what's on my XM  or something  I guess that's a spot  we do  you're  you're commenting  on something  what do you think  we keep our headphones on  and listen to the commercial breaks  you jackass  we're pissing  eating  doing whatever  that reading  whatever else  stop it  and he keeps posting it  alright  shut up  just ban him  I'm close to banning him  I gave up on  uh  make me ban you  I gave up on 
[02:25:30]  trying to get better promos  for the channel  yeah  cause you know  we've been at this  nine months  and you know  we finally got rid of  the bad comedy breaks  but now it's promos  for other channels  that our listeners  would never listen to  maybe a tiny percentage  sure  that's it  you never know  yeah but it's  it's not worth it  it's not  it's basic marketing strategy  you look at  your whole platform  wow  what channels  would the  ONA listener  want to hear  that they just don't know about  right  and I would  I would bet a lot of money  it's not the jazz channel 
[02:26:00]  70s  80s  the comedy channel  maybe Fox  Ethel  Ethel  Squiz  or what's the best one  the Boneyard  maybe even a country channel  cause we  you know  believe it or not  we do have a lot of people  but to  I was  I was coming into work today  and they're doing a promo  for real jazz or something  like what  that's just laziness  whoever's doing the promos  is just lazy  I thought you meant jazz  Major League Baseball  would be obvious  sure  Bob Edwards  there's  well  there's  you know  there's so many channels 
[02:26:30]  and  you know  pick the ones  that our listeners  would most likely  want to hear  but they don't know about  did you see us  passing by Bob Edwards  at the XM facility  when we were in Washington  he was coming out  to smoke a cigarette  I guess  oh dear  even better  we passed  hello  we passed by him  last night  you did  yeah  Jimmy finally made  the observation  like  you know  this guy  has never done  anything bad to us  he's actually  if I hear a nice guy  he's never bad  I have no problem  with Bob Edwards  I have no problem  with Bob Edwards  none 
[02:27:00]  he just comes from  him being a ghoul  and he has a head  like Stonehenge  he looks like one of  the way outs  in the Flintstones  oh my god  isn't that great  he does look like  a way out  he's like  he's losing the hair  on top  so he decides  that he's going to  like grow it long  in the back  a little bit  but he's not  really committing yet  it's really weird  and he just walks around  like a ghoul  doesn't talk to anybody  and he's just  constantly searching  for a place to smoke  but he's a nice enough guy  and it's not his fault  that XM is  promoting him  ad nauseum  and leaving us 
[02:27:30]  in the closet  like the retarded  sibling  once again  not the smartest marketing  but I'm not  running the marketing department  he walks around  trying to avoid  amber alerts  but it's  but it's very  awkward now  walking into him  because I don't want him  to get the impression  that we don't like him  awkward  Anthony  let me tell you something  you weren't there last night  you know  obviously  we have spent a lot of time  trashing people  on this show  and it's all fun  and stuff  and we're disconnected 
[02:28:00]  from Washington  but then when you have  these XM functions  like we did last night  no one wants to say hi to you  no one wants to come up to you  no  Gary Wall actually  shook my hand  without even looking at me  who?  who?  oh Gary Wall did I say?  yeah  wow  who's Gary Wall?  oh because Ben was talking  about Gary Wall  I was going to say  if Gary Wall was there  who?  who shook your hand?  oh Gary Hahn  Jesus  exactly  hey wait  is Bruce here? 
[02:28:30]  yeah Bruce is here  because Bruce was introducing me  to somebody  look at bug eyed  runaway bride on Fox News  they're having a Fox News alert  she's pleased guilty  to making a false statement  but these are like  the first real video pictures  I've seen  she's blinking like Norton  look at her eyes  she's insane  look at what a crazy woman  oh this bitch is nuts  she's crazy  I love her  I love her  she's nuts  oh my god  I've never seen anyone's eye  a little bit more  what's going on with her?  wow  she really  all she wants 
[02:29:00]  is a Spanish guided banger  with a nice box in her face  and the back of a van  that's all she wants  to be happy  look at this clown  still standing next to her  she's crazy  oh he really is dumb  look at him  what's with the eyes  and the blinking  do we have volume on this  is there anything  worth listening to  no word yet  on whether  only in one  her sentence is actually  going to be imposed  but again she's been  in and out of court  this morning  having just checked out  of some kind of a  rehabilitation facility  just a short time ago  Jennifer Wilbanks 
[02:29:30]  pleads guilty  to making a false statement  the judge  well  lets her off  with mostly probation  community service  and a fine  we'll keep you updated  wow look at the bug guys  look at everybody  knows the guy's not banging her  by the way  add to the list of things  we got a fix  that was just in one  one ear  and someone out there  is going to be  really pissed off  because their XM  is not going to be  set up or anything  I wanted to ask Bruce  because it's funny  you tell me the awkwardness  down there  and of course Bruce  is one of the nice guys  he was introducing me  to somebody  awkwardness 
[02:30:00]  what awkwardness  Bruce loves everybody  Bruce has never had  a problem with anyone  well a couple of bourbon  and sodas  don't hurt either  he introduced me  to somebody  going oh this is Jimmy  he's doing this thing  for HBO  just being like a nice guy  did I misspeak?  no you were very gentle  what I'm saying is  the guy he was introducing me to  Bruce could have just as easily  been saying  this is Jimmy  he's a child pornography trafficker  but there was a lot of things  dropped  due to legal search and seizure  and here he is  working with us  who was the guy 
[02:30:30]  you were introducing me to  I've never seen  a more miserable mug  not in general  but to be introduced to me  that guy wanted nothing to do with me  didn't like you  oh no  who was the guy  that you were introducing me to  well I introduced you to my boss  and that wasn't he  because he shook your hand cordially  as I recall  who was your boss  the guy was fine  he wasn't mean  but you could just see  he wanted nothing to do with me  yeah  that's how we are  was he your boss  or that was the guy  that might be him  oh I don't think so  oh he hated me  we give people a taste of reality  nobody hates you Jimmy  everyone likes you  we give people a taste of reality 
[02:31:00]  and some just don't like it  too bad  I mean  maybe Anthony  and Eric  but you  is her name really  Wilbang by the way  Wilbanks  Wilbanks  that would be hilarious  if her name was Jennifer Wilbang  so Bruce  the people at XMH  can we kind of get the vibe  that they do it a little bit  no you know what  there was a little bit  you know what  when the new baby  comes in  all the kids  who are already there 
[02:31:30]  sort of feel like  they're getting short shrifted  because  you got  you know  because  oh daddy's not  mommy aren't playing with me  anymore  they just want to play  with the baby  and  I think they're over that now  well how was your reception  in Washington  I understand  there was like a big invite  for everybody to come by  and see you guys  did people come by  and see you  yeah I think two people did  two  three maybe  yeah two people  did you serve refreshments  we got one person on  the girl from the 70s channel  she was very cool  I forgot her name  off hand  and  and  and 
[02:32:00]  sorry  none of them want to come by  they don't want to be a part of it  no  we did  send out a mass email  come on by  and check out the show  maybe come on in  and  promote your channel  whatever  here's a little tip  from being president of my synagogue  you know  serve refreshments  you'll get people  served refreshments  is that it  good food  plenty of it  nah it doesn't have to be good either  just some crullers  some you know  coffee  I must say though  the mad mexican  one of our biggest fans  and supporters down there  got a 
[02:32:30]  crazy mexican  that's pretty much  who  who  drops in  when we're down there  one of the big  objects of curiosity  is it's like  oh do they really bring in the numbers  are they really doing good stuff for us  and  you know  as we all know  those who know  don't tell  and  then those who don't know  are just  spouting all over the place  that's what I always say  what  does that mean  who's wondering  if we're doing the numbers  I'd love to know who's wondering  oh you want me to  you think I'm going to name names on the show  I don't think so  that's not a bad thing  to say somebody's wondering something 
[02:33:00]  that's not an awful  yeah just write it down so we know  that's not a bad thing  somebody's wondering something  is perfectly acceptable  I think it's just  I think it's just a sort of general curiosity  you know  I mean  I'm sure it's serious  they're probably going to say the same thing about Stern  when he gets there  with the bottom line  they're saying that we're arrogant and cocky  it's like look  what are these guys really doing for us  they're so cocky  they bitch a lot  they knock  you know  we don't bitch as much  his name rhymes with  Shoe Manero  you need to  I usually wear headphones  he doesn't need them 
[02:33:30]  he's great  he doesn't want to mess up his hair  I like him very much  I like Buddy  the guy we had the problem with at first  is a nice guy  you know he's brilliant  really  the sound of Frank's Place  for people who like that music  and they got a lot of fans  it's a really big  there's really no outlet for that kind of music  yeah but are they getting the numbers  I think so  I think so  I want to question that  well it's kind of hard to tell  so people kind of walk around  they kind of bitch  like yeah this is a fucking asshole  no no  it was just a general jealousy at first 
[02:34:00]  because  there's a grumbling  it was perceived  that you guys were getting all the attention  and you know  it was like  oh what about me  what about me  and you know  well you've been here for four years already  shut the hell up  now that the new facilities are opened up  when do the cubicles get moved out of here  oh well are they going to get moved out of here  I don't know  they better be  aren't you guys going to move your own people  aren't there going to be shows coming out of here  and all kinds of other stuff  well yeah we got plans  for that whole area  all those cubicles 
[02:34:30]  we need this whole cubicle area to be swept clean  goodbye  and we want to put in a little performance area  you know I don't like  I don't like the way this conversation is going  I still got to live here you know  by the way  by the way Bruce runs into your facility  we've never had you on the air officially I don't think  maybe once I don't know  maybe once or twice  Bruce is a great guy  and  he supports us  usually that's a grimace  he had a deal  he had a deal with the building yesterday  because the girls that were all painted up  yeah  the building super came in 
[02:35:00]  like later in the day  he said you know  uh oh  wait a minute  what he said  it's better we know what he said  he actually had said that  the ladies bathroom was covered with paint  and I said you know  smooth it out a little bit  as you know always do  and of course  it's you you know  didn't know  we knew we had  we had some artists in here  were the toilet seats covered with paint  apparently  yeah  apparently  apparently  we had  we got complaints  generally he wouldn't spring into action 
[02:35:30]  unless there were complaints from the rest of the floor  you know you got  it's kind of a mixed bag  on the floor we live on here  yeah who else is on this floor  um  there's an outfit called victory schools  which is a sort of alternative  educational centers  they put up  they're actually pretty good  what are victory schools  what do they do  they deal with troubled teens  or what do they do  no I mean  they're alternative  facilities  they come and move in  to places where  the school system is not good  and they supplement it  or you know the voucher  there's a whole thing about vouchers  and things like that  they're sort of 
[02:36:00]  sort of tied up with that  you sound stuffy  they're rabble rousers  rabble rousers  right  kids with water heads  well they may be doing gifted children  too  could be gifted children  sure  there's an organization  that actually does  big funding for things  like malls  and shopping centers  like big ticket  kind of  commercial properties  I'm sure they're very  integrity driven people  yeah I'm sure  not out for the buck  well we have to break  big time here  aw  alright thank you Bruce  bye Bruce  really appreciate it

[02:43:00]  introduce yourself to the new audience  you do the tech file  right the techno file  it's a  techno file  short form technology update  that's on  about 80 radio stations nationwide  plus  XM  yeah  XM being the most important actually  you're the hero of the geeks  so yeah  so I travel around  all these big conventions  and  get to go  you know  write off all sorts of  international debauchery  while checking out all the  gaming conventions  electronics  yeah I just got back from 
[02:43:30]  E3  E3  that's it  every rapper  in the world  wants a video game now  is that the thing now  that they have to have  they have to have  their own video game  like rappers are very competitive  we know this  they kill each other  they're so competitive  competitive  and you know  it was  sneakers  and then  you know  clothing deals  their rides  whatever they're driving around in  and now they're  very competitive  about having video games  they want their own video games  wow 
[02:44:00]  this place is coming apart  hold on  Wick  is everything alright  what happened  you alright  guys stumbling around  alright  what's the matter  Hawk  what happened today  this place is coming apart  what happened  well the nice thing  you know  about video games  is their egos  can actually  you know  they're like  give me some of that  waifu  you know  make me like  flying through the air  with my kung fu skills  that's what they want to be like  superheroes  they're always talking trash 
[02:44:30]  about how hard they are  yeah man  I want slag wings  and shit  that's really funny  I want to get up on time  be a working  yeah  I want  I want this to be like  really whack  like something  completely unrealistic  have me raising my kids  yo man  how about this  I get pulled over  and shit  and I present  the proper paperwork  shit  and I don't back talk 
[02:45:00]  to the cops  or nothing  oh damn  I got an order of protection  I lost 20 points  yeah boy  yo one time  in a video game  I want to refer  to my baby's mother  as my fiance  yeah  just completely  unrealistic  right  then we go to do that mission  where we shoot up  Hot 97 man  yo how about this  in this video game man  somebody does some shit  in my community  and we actually 
[02:45:30]  take personal responsibility  how are you supposed  to program that in  that's too unrealistic  just have me flying  and shit  I was just watching  the 50 cents  50 cents has got  this video game  coming out  early next year  and I was watching  the trailer  out there  with Steve  and it's  50 cents  storming an office building  and shooting  and beating up  white dudes  really  not a black dude  getting beat up  in the whole trailer  it's like guys in suits 
[02:46:00]  that he's ripping on  that's great  and supposedly  the premise is that  in the game  he never got his record deal  and he had to manage  his life on the streets  ah so he just continued  being a thug  right  and we have audio  because he never got  his record deal  is this the audio  yeah this is part of  he did this interview  at E3  like up on the big screen  yeah  sort of a produced interview  and the name of the game  is bulletproof  and it goes  the name of this game  is 50 cent  bun  like you can't even  pronounce the name  of this  of course he can't 
[02:46:30]  should we play the tape  what  should we play  what's wrong  what's wrong with his mic technique  Eric  Eric why don't you get on mic  how come he has headphones  and I don't  Eric talk  I know  he's not even talking  I said move the mic up a little bit  that's all  ok  no  I'm trying to help you  wow  dude there are radio stations  in Poughkeepsie  that have a better setup  I know  alright  oh isn't that a shame  why don't we play the audio  of the 50 cent thing  you don't have to play  the whole thing  it's like two minutes  but it's like 
[02:47:00]  this is  it's like my real life  but it's sort of fake  but it's you know  what would have happened  I'm keeping it real  only not real  right  there's two things about me  the name of the video game  is 50 cent  I love it  it's almost like  a whole nother screenplay  to my life  the first time I saw myself  in a video game  I was really excited about it  because  it looks so much like me 
[02:47:30]  I haven't seen  a video game  with so much detail to it  the graphics  that they had  in the trailer  it was like  so much more  cutting edge  they created  something  that I'm really proud  of actually being  a part of it  because I feel like  it's going to be  the most exciting  video game this year  alright well 
[02:48:00]  there you have it  a little taste  wow  can you imagine  if a video game  came out  with a white guy  running into a building  you're shooting  black guy  I mean first of all  no good person  would believe it  can you imagine  the uproar  from people  like  Denoopoly  got a lot of shit  I think it was  in Urban Outfitters  because it portrayed  the black community  in a bad way  yeah  can you imagine  if a white guy  just shooting  black guys in a building  how fast  people would be  up in an army  but this is 50  you know  I have no problem  with the game  I'm just saying  the reverse 
[02:48:30]  would be a problem  I had a guy  email me  he's like  man I really like  that Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas  I'm like  oh that's cool  my favorite part  is you get a helicopter  and you get to  go through the hood  and shoot black people  that's your white  supremacist dream  with a helicopter  I love that game  though man  San Andreas  it's like  something tells me  50 cents game  is probably based  a lot on  Grand Theft Auto  a lot of running around  a lot of killing  there are so many  Grand Theft Auto  rip offs  at E3 
[02:49:00]  I mean it's just  annoying  and they're not good  like for some reason  people cannot capture  what they did  with GTA  you can't  you can make  an exact copy of it  but it's just  not GTA  is 50 cent  doing something  that's more realistic  now  like does he have to  burst into  like an accountant's  office and sit there  and make sure  that the power of  attorney is correct  and he's dealing  with lawyers  because that's  what his life is  yo it's real whack  when a part of the  game comes up  where I gots to do  my quarterly taxes  I sit down  with my accountant  he's a Jew 
[02:49:30]  and it's like  all of Hollywood  is trying to get in  on it  because like 50 cent  is actually working  with a guy  from The Sopranos  really  yeah like the  executive producer  I think his name  is Terry Winter  on this game  yeah  and Snoop Dogg  has now got  John Singleton  to work  on a game  well Snoop  turned up  in that other  game  one of those  GTA looking  Snoop's in like  every game  yeah Snoop  just turns up  true crime  right  Streets of LA  yeah he turned up  in that one

[02:53:30]  I'm gonna pick  that up  when does that  come out  uh early  2006  nice  is he getting  good reviews  that one  probably hasn't  this is the first  that they showed  right right  it just came out  a week ago  and I also brought  the trailer to  Scarface  it's not very  entertaining though  it's just like  him sitting at a  desk and there's  clips from the movie  but dude they are  mining every piece  of Hollywood  there's a Godfather  game  Godfather now  that kind of the  trailer I saw for it  was pretty short  but it kind of  looked cool  I didn't even 
[02:54:00]  check that one  yeah  I want to see  that one  Godfather  graphics look really  good  they're doing  like Dirty Harry  yeah  they're doing  Taxi Driver  they're doing  I mean  they're mining  like even  they're doing  like a He-Man  video game  He-Man's been  dead for years  how's the  how's the grandson  in the Godfather  video game  that's the only  one I want to  see is the  grandson Frank  all I care about  he writes  different cards  that's the whole  game  when you log out  does it go  now you get  the hell out  of here  sound cues 
[02:54:30]  they're doing  like a Jaws  video game  it looks so  gay  really  it's like  you control  the shark  it is just  lame  it's just  stupid  yeah  they are  mining  Hollywood  and like  there's a lot  of really good  stuff out there  a lot of  really good  movies  that potentially  could be ruined  and tainted  because just  leave them alone  come up with  your own ideas  I got back  into stupid  Star Wars  Galaxies again  is that good  I thought about  buying it  I was playing  it for a while  I got tired  of the bugs 
[02:55:00]  and the constant  nerfing of the  character I had  they kept taking  away like stuff  that made it  kind of fun  and cool to play  I worked my way  up like I grinded  like an ass  for months  because we weren't  working at the time  so I'm just  playing this game  to reach Bounty  Hunter  because Bounty  Hunter was like  the badass of the  game  and I was going  around just  it is player  versus player  you're not just  playing computer  generated characters  so I had like  the badass weapons  really quickly  because I just  played all the time  so I never  tagged myself  with what I  actually was 
[02:55:30]  I put like  I was a scout  but actually  I was a bounty  hunter at the time  so I'd pick  fights with people  I'd go to like  people waiting  for a shuttle ship  and call them  names and ask  well fight me  and it'd be like  fight me dickhead  and they'd pull out  their weapon  and I would turn  around and just  lay the guy out  in one shot  and the guy's  like dead  and it was kind  of fun  fucking with people  like that  but then they  just nerfed  the character  and now they  got Jedi in there  and you screw  with them  and you're just  dead  like instantly  what's nerfed  the character  mean?  it means that  the company  decided that  the characters  aren't balanced 
[02:56:00]  enough  which apparently  it wasn't  if I was  killing everybody  so they take  away like  one of these  shots I had  was instantly  knock the person  on their ass  they were disabled  for five seconds  for that five seconds  I'm just laying  shots into them  and they would  die right there  on the ground  not able to  get one shot  off  so the tech  guys at Sony  decide  we're going to  nerf this guy's  character and put  a timer on it  so he can only  fire one shot  in ten seconds  a big pain  in the ass  so I kind of  got bored with it  and left  and then they came  out with the  expansion  jump to light 
[02:56:30]  speed  now they got  some spaceships  and stuff  and I'm like  let me just  check it out  check it out  turns into  eight hours  on the computer  flying around  trying to figure  it all out  again  so I'm kind of  hooked back  into that  so you've  given up  EverQuest  EverQuest 2  I was kind of  getting into  that again  but you realize  you're playing  EverQuest 2  and you're going  I totally remember  why I left  EverQuest 1  it's the same  fucking game  with a 2 behind  it just gets  the grind  it gets monotonous  you're looking  for something new 
[02:57:00]  to do  I get the email  from the EverQuest  Widows group  I love reading  that  he's in there  again  talking to that  woman online  so I wrote this  article for Playboy  about people who  become widowed by  video games  because the guys  fall in love  with their virtual  life  their virtual life  is so much  more exciting  hell he's  you know  and what is  a knight  and what is  wrong with that  if you could  have a better  life online  what's the problem  if you dumb  women would  shut up  and suck  your husband's  dicks  it wouldn't be  obsessed with  video games  correct  fucking henhouse  boars  you're supposed 
[02:57:30]  to blow off  the game  so you go  back to your  regular life  which is just  a boar fest  and you know  when your mind  is never going  to get better  screw that  well that's what  they do  they sit there  for hours and  hours and play  these games  go ahead  the article  in playboy  though  that sounds  interesting  oh it was insane  I actually  interviewed the  mom of the  kid that blew  his brains out  oh yeah  that was a  big news story  and I didn't  want to even  talk to her  I was talking  to her on  the anniversary  of blowing  his brains out  and why did  he kill himself  they always 
[02:58:00]  blame it on  the game  but it's not  it's like  oh he killed  himself  well he also  had a little  like a lot  of pill problem  and you know  it's always  you know  he was in  therapy  there were  there were  a lot of  rumors that  fly around  on the internet  too  yeah I heard  like he lost  his epic  weapon  right  he couldn't  get it back  and he blew  his brains out  it's like those  stories  got thrown out  of his guild  right  he got to  blow his brains  out  there was a  rumor that he  proposed to  somebody in the  game and they  turned him out  that's another  thing they have  in-game marriages  where you buy

[03:17:00]  hey did we finish the Rolls Royce story  or did we go off on a tangent  oh that idiot  I talked to him briefly about it  he said he paid like 26 grand  and this is how you know you're dealing with a dummy  for like an old car right  a Rolls Royce 26 grand  you can't get a Rolls Royce  for under a quarter million  and he goes  if it looks like it does in a picture  yeah that's the way to buy an automobile  you shit  look at the photo  one dimensional picture  where's he gonna drive it  in Plainfield?  he really is  that's why you live in a fucking jersey  what are you gonna do with a Rolls Royce jersey?  it's gonna be a Toyota  with like a shitty emblem  like glued on 
[03:17:30]  what's that show  they fix your car  and they put ribs on  pimp my ride  yeah pimp my ride  right  Voss is  Voss is doing anything he can  just to avoid  that fucking mirror  that eye to eye contact  he makes with himself in the mirror  and to realize  to realize what he is  there's nothing internal  just fucking me  and a ring  and a hot chick  now he's gonna be  talking about his Rolls Royce  now he's got a Rolls Royce  it's gonna be  remember when he had nothing  he was talking about  how he had the Mercedes  now he's got the Rolls Royce  it's gonna be unbearable 
[03:18:00]  we're gonna have to hear  Rolls Royce stories  you know  I was driving along  at least if he was black  he could run some bitches  out of it or something  yeah  you know he got nothing  Voss is going  here's Voss's thing  because Voss is such an idiot  he's got the Rolex  he's got the Rolls Royce  he wants class  Voss thinks that makes him classy  and he probably uses the word classy a lot  like he watches on the waterfront  and he goes like  I could have class  I could be a contender  and he thinks he's a somebody  and he's just a  Rich if you're listening  you're a dumb nobody  nobody buys a Rolls Royce off eBay  no one  you should still be able to see it 
[03:18:30]  shouldn't you on eBay  they usually do that  eBay is fencing so much stolen shit now  good  it's like  people are stealing stuff  and I was reading this article  that pawn shops are upset  because eBay is stealing all their thunder  because nobody's bringing the stolen shit  to the pawn shop  and a lot of scams going on too  where people are selling stuff  that doesn't even exist  what are you punching in there  for the fucking dummy  you can bid on Voss  I'm searching for fucking dummies  in Rolls Royce  how do you buy a Rolls 
[03:19:00]  offline  I don't know  how much was it?  26,000  which is the going rate for a Rolls  we've won here for 24  the cheapest one I'm looking at  what is this  how could it be  probably just the bids  9,000  how many miles are on a Rolls Royce  that you can sell for 24,000  that's a $200,000 car  is it not  yeah  you're supposed to have a  you know  I bet it's 25 years old  it's got  I bet it's 25  not a classic 
[03:19:30]  not old enough to be a classic  but like a 1980  there's one  1985 Rolls Royce  it's a  $27,900  so  $28,000  and there is one picture  is there a picture  is there a picture  of the minority  that is going to drive you around  now they  actually  even if he's a Puerto Rican  your name's Jeeves  shut up  older black man  you're the best friend  I ever had  Mr. Voss  take me to Piggly Wiggly  Mr. Voss 
[03:20:00]  I'm just trying to  drive you to the stove  I gotta make water  now I must say  I would love to  trash this  but from the pictures  and there are plenty of pictures  this Rolls Royce  looks very nice  for $28,000  I guarantee you  there's a problem  with it  well there would probably  be a problem  the fucking Rolls Royce  man  the bait and switch  by the way  there's no engine  the bait and switch  here's the picture 
[03:20:30]  the one they send you  now yeah  this could be the one  and this is the actual one  and they get away with it  by saying yeah  this is the Rolls Royce  you'll be buying  this picture was taken  before the pile up  yeah  this was taken in 1985  yeah this is actually  85  there's a chick  with a big poodle hairdo  driving it  open the trunk  I see  Kajagoogoo tapes  on the scene  that was one of the  Whitesnake videos  David Copperfield  yeah yeah  David Copperfield  whatever his fucking name is  Coverdale  whatever  David Copperfield

Bobby and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[03:26:30]  Hello, nationality.  I've got a blood flow line.  I've got a blood flow line.  All right.  Let's get right back into it.  We've got Laszlo from the Technophile in studio.  I want to do a ringtone now.  I'm obsessed.  I don't believe in the ringtones.  That ringtone is money, dude.  Money.  Money in the bank.  Money in the bank.  That is the hugest industry right now, dude, is ringtones. 
[03:27:00]  You know what?  I'll play Opie.  And me and Anthony, we'll go and do it.  All right?  Do you want to do some ringtones?  Stay at home, okay?  I'm not doing the ringtones.  Now, when your phone rings, instead of hearing the normal Nokia ring or Motorola, you would  hear...  Hey, this is Opie, Anthony.  You're stupid.  Like that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You hear that?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You're getting a little too comfortable in the studio, I see.  What's going on here?  Your little hacky little music thing.  I apologize.  I stepped on that little dumb bit.  That is a good one.  Instead of your phone ringing, yeah, it does this. 
[03:27:30]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Something cute like that.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Or it could be like...  Open your mouth.  They're paying for it.  You eat it.  I would call myself all day if I could hear fucking Sergeant Hartman.  Or if it's a trainee calling Norton back.  Ring, ring, ring, ring.  Hi, Daddy.  You could do this one.  I broke my knee. 
[03:28:00]  I broke my knee.  Oh, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  I broke my knee.  That faggity moan.  That should be the ring.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Just hold my hand.  All right, let's do ringtones.  Now I'm feeling the ringtones.  Hey, you got to do it.  Ben's got something on ringtones.  Go ahead, Ben.  It's outselling Coldplay in the UK.  It's the number one thing in the UK.  Yeah, in the UK.  The ringtone.  Oh, different ones?  Axle F.  No, it's Axle F.  Axle F is outselling the new Coldplay.  Remember the theme song? 
[03:28:30]  Which one was that?  Beverly Hills Coppert.  Yeah.  Steve has the...  People are using that as their fucking...  If your phone rings out, I hope it's the doctor calling to tell you it tested positive.  Who the fuck would want that on their phone?  You fucking 80s idiots.  They're making so much money from it.  Oh, Lord.  There you go.  Pick up.  Must be for me.  Hold on.  Hello.  How do I do a little rerun?  What's that, Doc?  Holy shit, is that awful. 
[03:29:00]  And it's not just ring...  I'm falling for the banana in my cell phone.  It's not just ringtones.  It's ringbacktones.  They're making a ton of money on that.  Ringbacktones.  Right.  So that when you call my cell phone, I have a special song program that you hear when  you're calling me.  So it's a song just for Anthony.  So if I call you, you have this programmed in where it's a ringbacktone to me.  So over the...  Right.  Over the phone, you're hearing the Axle F theme.  But it has to be...  You should do like ringbacktones like, hey, if you're a bill collector, go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  That'd be great.  I'm going to do this ringtone and no one can take this, but I'm going to fucking... 
[03:29:30]  This is Jim Norton.  Ring.  Ring.  No one has the worst ringtone.  Martini Steve.  When his phone rings in that office, what does he have?  I can't stand anything other than a goddamn ring.  Has anybody heard of fucking vibrate?  I don't want to hear your goddamn polyphonic faggot shit.  There is one I heard that I actually like.  Techno.  Banana phone I love.  Because that's so...  Now that would be cute.  All of a sudden...  Oh, that's me.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Not mistaking it.  I would actually have that on my ringer. 
[03:30:00]  What does Steve sound like?  It's awful.  Get Steve in here.  When Voss calls me, this is what I hear on my phone.  That idiot who walks on stage to paperback writer.  We all have walk-on music on some shows.  Fucking old man walks on to paperback writer.  Oh, he is an idiot.  What is that supposed to mean?  He just thinks he's hip, and it's like a fast-paced song.  Dumb fuck.  He hasn't read a book since he was eight. 
[03:30:30]  Here's Voss's ringtone.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  It goes on and on.  I love it.  It stinks, and I don't like it.  Oh, from Spider-Man.  That was like Voss showing the car.  Do you like my Rolls Royce?  Do you like my Rolls Royce?  Look at the color.  I've got to paint it the same color as yours.  Do you want to kiss me on the teeth? 
[03:31:00]  How old is Voss?  92.  He's having a serious midlife crisis.  Pardon me.  Do you have any grape hoopon?  Get a Trans Am.  What an ad.  Buy a Firebird.  Just get the midlife crisis going, baby.  Matt.  What do you think?  It's grape hoopon.  Grape hoopon.  You know, the grape jelly.  Yeah, of course he wouldn't get it right.  Oh, God.  All right, let's go to the phone real fast.  Let's say hi to Tim in Jersey.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  How's everything going?  All right.  I've got the banana phone ringtone already going on my phone, and I've also got your promo 
[03:31:30]  that Steve put together when you guys first started back in November.  Oh, yeah?  Yep.  I'm a dork.  You owe them four bucks.  How do I hook that up?  I want to do that ringtone thing.  Let's get a website going and make some money with the ringtones.  I'm telling you.  Don't feel it, bro.  I'm feeling it.  Your guerrilla fans love you, dude.  Y'all can make a mint.  So what do we do?  We just set up a website or something?  People are making their own ringtones.  You have seven companies today who are going to want to hook y'all up.  This is retarded. 
[03:32:00]  Remember that guy?  I like big butts.  Yeah, yeah.  He's just back in the fucking mood.  See, I thought I was original.  He sold a million of those things.  I thought I was original.  That's what I wanted as far as my ringtone goes, is that song.  I like big butts, yeah.  Maybe some tone loc.  Oh, he's good.  Steve, what is your phone?  What is your ringtone?  Shut up.  Hold on, wait.  Do you want me to play it or just hear it?  Let's hear it.  It's Ramone.  Whoops.  Damn it.  Hold on.  Imagine.  Oh, this is great radio.  Hello.  We're waiting for a crappy ringtone.  That's it. 
[03:32:30]  That's the one.  That's right.  And that's what they all sound like.  Right.  And it goes off in the gym in Chelsea, and that's a sign that comes below me.  Awful.  If your phone has that, when you answer it, a cock should just pop out of the mouthpiece  and rub against your lips.  It's awful.  What is it?  The crazy front ringtone in Europe.  Oh, is that the big one?  Yeah, this is the one.  What do you expect?  Six different remixes.  Fucking worthless continent.  Wait, what is this?  Thank you.  They did nothing but get their asses up by the Russians.  Biggest ringtone ever.  This is the biggest ringtone.  This is how it's being downloaded like crazy. 
[03:33:00]  But it's like two and a half.  What is this?  Play a piece of it.  It's actually a remix of Axel F.  Bing, bing, bambam, bambam, bambam, bambam, bambam, bambam, bambam, bambam, bambam, bambam, bambam, bambam.  What's going on?  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  Your own trash fucking phone ringtone.  This is the biggest selling ringtone?  This would be muffled because it would be up someone's ass so fast.  European state.  They are awful.  They are pathetic.  That's, that's atrocious.  This is what socialized medicine gets you. 
[03:33:30]  How long does your phone ring for?  Exactly.  Answer the goddamn phone.  How is this?  Ah.  This is brutal.  This is downloaded like, it outsold Coldplay.  It's all fish.  In the UK.  Number one.  It's all these fucking, all these awful Euro trash club goers.  Yeah.  Black turtle next to them.  They keep doing douchebags.  Yeah.  No filter having cigarettes.  Sheep.  Ugh.  They're fucking disgusting.  They're disgusting in latex.  You and your Euro. 
[03:34:00]  Ugh.  Yeah.  One, one, one monetary denomination for the whole continent.  Bunch of faggots.  Stop trying to be the US too.  Yeah, right.  What are you trying to be?  Russia kicked your ass and then they fell and all of a sudden you get the little man complex.  Sorry.  No, no, they can't.  Well, you know.  They can't vote on it.  They can't get everybody to fuck up.  They can't close it out.  Good.  Nope.  They can't close the deal.  They're, they're rejecting it left and right over there.  And they stink.  Literally.  But they know the second something happens.  They got no soap.  Germany will just poke its head up and start goose stepping across all of them again.  They got no soap.  That's what happened. 
[03:34:30]  Even Poland, it's nothing to be concerned about.  Nothing to be concerned about.  Hey, Eric, what is your ringtone phone, ringtone tone?  What, you got a bad one too?  Steve said it's awful.  Oh God, here we go.  That's it?  That's it.  That's a regular.  No, everyone in that room is saying no, no, no.  Oh, the other one.  Oh, the other one.  No, we met the one that sounded like a telephone ringing.  You got two cell phones?  What the fuck?  Yeah, what the hell?  What's the difference?  Oh, the other one?  I guarantee you this is a big difference.  Let's see. 
[03:35:00]  Hurry up, nervous.  Keep going.  What is that?  That's all it does.  What is that?  Gay.  Song by Less Than Jake.  Old punk song.  What?  So you didn't know which one they meant.  Yeah.  It was the ring or the Less Than Jake song.  The one that just sounds like a ringing phone.  If you're a real fan of punk, that's really a real punk thing.  Yeah, that's a real punk song.  Yeah, Less Than Jake.  Wow, I was ready to pogo.  Maybe punk's on Castro.  Now he's getting sand in his pussy. 
[03:35:30]  Now he's a little mad at me.  What's the matter?  He's mad because I said that wasn't punk.  We got to toughen him up a little bit.  That's a good song to have on your phone if you can't get, I ran.  My Sharona was all booked up.  I know they're going like crazy, these ringtones, but I don't get it.  How long does your friggin' phone ring?  It isn't kind of nicer than a regular ringtone.  No, it isn't.  When you're sitting on a train and one of these fuckin' things perks up behind you, 
[03:36:00]  you want to shove your fist down their teeth.  The Long Island Railroad sounds like a ringtone testing facility.  It sucks.  And I was reading the kids now will pretend that their phones are ringing,  just so that they can show off their ringtone.  Oh, really?  I want to hear your fuckin' Jay-Z tune, dude.  I like that.  Yeah, a little Jay-Z never heard of that, buddy.  I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't won.  Yeah.  Bitches!  Put a ghetto blaster on your shoulder. 
[03:36:30]  Billionaire Productions, my philosophy about it.  Check it out.  A speaker the size of a dime.  That's all I want to hear.  Yeah, Angel Salazar I want to hear.  Shout out.  White people!  I has a 12-inch penis.  I don't have it with me.  That's what that deserves.  Let's go to Timmy in Pennsylvania.  Timmy, what's up?  Check it out.  Hey, fellas, you can stab that old woman going, who is this? 
[03:37:00]  Nice ringtone, right?  Who is this?  Should we go into the ringtone business?  Yes.  Just kidding.  Should we?  I say we do it.  Make a mint.  I say we do it.  We split it three ways.  I think Pete wanted to get us involved in the ringtone business.  Did he?  I want the Shivo ringtone.  Speaking of Pete, Pete Porelli.  One second.  Terry Shivo ringtones.  Come on.  How much would you pay for that?  But you can't answer the phone. 
[03:37:30]  All you can do is look at it and long for human contact.  Why can't you have like ringtones?  Wait, let's Mike Joey there, Eric.  No, why can't you have like ringtones and just people fucking?  Like just hearing, oh, fuck me the ear, you know, just give me, pick me the other ear.  That'd be nice.  Give it to me, Papa.  That's what I want to invent.  Fuck the music shit.  Yeah, you know at the PTA meeting and that one goes off?  Yeah.  The ringtones, they're all nice and cute now, but I guarantee that's the direction it's 
[03:38:00]  going to go.  Let's go.  I hope we get on this shit today.  It's just going to get more and more shocking.  Yeah, shocking.  There's software that you can make your own ringtones.  We're going to do shock tones.  Yeah.  I mean, you can make your own.  Huh?  We'll do shock tones.  That's what you need to call them.  Trademark it.  I invented the phone ring before me.  People just had to guess when someone was calling and picking up.  Hello?  Tell them, Fred.  Tell them.  I did that years ago, Fred.  Oh, man.  Please.  You know about the Terry Schiavo guy?  I feel bad about it.  The Terry Schiavo guy?  Yeah, the guy.  The guy.  The husband. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, the husband.  The husband.  You know, 15 years of dealing with a mother-in-law, you know, unfiltered.  That fucking brutality every Christmas.  Every Christmas.  Terry would have done it this way.  Terry would have done it that way.  She's not here, you cunt.  And if you were red to her and hugged her, she wouldn't be dead now.  That's the perfect marriage, though.  All she can do is go.  No, she can't even go like that.  She's always horizontal.  She's always horizontal.  All right.  Imagine that boring lump around the Christmas tree.  Hold on.  We're running out of show, but I have to go to the phone immediately. 
[03:39:00]  Here you go.  Immediately you have to go to the phone.  The phone.  The phone.  Rich Voss, everybody.  Oh, Rich.  Richie.  Hey, Voss.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Wait.  Hold on, Rich.  We got your stage music.  Go.  Paperback, right back, right back.  Ladies and gentlemen, give a warm welcome to Rich Voss.  Oh, you forget to mention all his credits.  I didn't.  I think you got them all in.  Hi, Rich. 
[03:39:30]  I love that song.  Hi, Butterfly.  How are you?  Of course you'll love it.  I'm on PayPal trying to get my $1,000 deposit back.  Are you?  Why?  Because this car is not what it's misrepresented.  Oh, what happened?  I'm Rolls Royce.  What happened?  Nothing.  First of all, when you go on a test drive, I don't think a car should break down.  Did it break down?  It just stopped, and then we coasted into a gas station.  This is perfect.  Oh, I got to tell you this, too.  He put gas in it, so it started working again, so he thinks it's a fuel pump. 
[03:40:00]  But then we got in the car, and there was such a mildew smell.  I go, what's that smell?  And this jackass put a box of sauerkraut and cabastis in the trunk.  He goes, oh, no, that's just sauerkraut.  We're going, what?  And he opens the trunk and goes, yeah, I have a box of something.  That was to hide the smell of a dead body that was in there.  Something went on in that car.  So are you going to get your $1,000 deposit back that you made on PayPal and eBay?  Why are those words you should never hear with a Rolls Royce at the end of the sentence?  Yeah, Rolls Royce involved. 
[03:40:30]  PayPal, eBay, $1,000 deposit.  And sauerkraut.  First of all, you know what, you jackasses, you thought you'd call me and attack me because  I bought something on eBay.  eBay is the same as buying out of classified ads.  Is it really?  Yeah, it is.  I have a Saturn.  It's funny.  It's maybe not the Rolls Royce, but it didn't break down with sauerkraut in the trunk, you  fucking awful idiot.  Yeah, well, it's just like a classified ad.  But I said it's just like a classified ad.  Yeah.  But you can go to the house and check it out before you give a deposit. 
[03:41:00]  A classified ad, you don't go, all right, meet me at my house, I'm going to give you  a grand, then we'll go check the car out, idiots.  How do you put $1,000 down, Rich, on a car you never sat in?  That's two weeks' salary for Rich Voss.  Yeah, exactly.  That's two weekends away.  And that's not good for Ralphie.  Now, listen to me.  Rich, what happened?  Here's the thing.  I did make a mistake by putting a deposit down, because I was coming to Florida anyhow.  That was my mistake. 
[03:41:30]  It's in Florida?  Oh, my God.  I'm in Florida.  I'm working this week.  You'd have a better chance getting on the bus with fucking Jon Voight and Ratzel Rizzo  than you do of getting a fucking Rolls Royce with $26,000.  You know what that is?  That's a Rolls Royce.  I'm going to sell it to you.  If you guys go to eBay, I'll show you the car.  It looks beautiful on eBay.  And what does it look like in real life?  What does it look like in real life?  I don't know.  The girl that Norton was with last night.  It looks horrible.  Your car has a dick? 
[03:42:00]  And how?  Now, now you guys call me to trash me about the car.  I was going to go and have a stick shift.  Yes.  Wow.  Ah, stick shift better.  Did you guys call me to trash me about the car?  Because I did research.  The car was going to be $26,000.  Yeah.  And I did research.  In excellent condition, what it said was it goes for $44,000 to $45,000.  Okay.  I was going to try to resell it and make some money. 
[03:42:30]  Okay.  Why are you trying to dabble in finance?  He's a used car dealer.  Yeah.  He's a used car salesman now.  Why don't you call Kurt Russell?  Maybe he can blow up the car a lot across the street owned by Jack Warden.  Hire Frank McRae to work for you.  Toby!  Was that a 26-year-old reference?  Yes, it was.  It was fantastic.  One of the best comedies ever done.  I agree.  You know, it's funny that when Norton does an old reference, it's so funny, but when I do it,  these idiots on the message boards go, I'm an asshole.  Because you were 20 when that happened. 
[03:43:00]  That's the thing.  And your old references are really old, Rich.  That was a used car.  Kurt Russell's still acting.  Yeah.  What year was the rolls?  It was the 88, and it only had 39,000 miles.  No, it didn't.  No, it didn't.  Sure.  That rolled back to 39,000.  A million 39.  Yes.  That's true.  You guys were just having a good time talking about Richard's little Rolls Royce deal before  I got on the air.  Well, why'd you, Rich, why'd you put a grand down?  Now, what happened with the guys? 
[03:43:30]  Did he give you your money back?  He kind of said no.  Oh, my.  How could he say no?  You don't want the car.  But PayPal said it would get the money back.  That's what PayPal said.  Why did this guy deny giving you the money back?  Because he said it would be in perfect condition once he fixes everything.  What?  He said, you know, he goes, you bought it.  Once he fixes everything.  Oh, my God.  Well, Mr. Richard Voss, I have a perfect vehicle for you here. 
[03:44:00]  Only used by a little old lady to drive back and forth to get her medicine.  You're being ripped off.  What kind of shyster?  All right, listen.  This is going to be an ongoing story because we've just ran out of show.  Voss, have fun in Florida.  What's the plug?  Improv.  Improv.  I'll be on the PayPal website looking for my money.  Calls back tomorrow.  Laszlo, the technophile.  I'm at lazlow.com.  And real fast, Ralphie May at Caroline's tonight. 
[03:44:30]  And Joey Diaz at Rascals in Jersey City.  Comment on the Hudson.  Comment on the Hudson.  That's it.  Party is over.  Everybody go home.  Voss, speak for the B&M and EO. </pre>
