<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Sam Roberts, Eric, and Jim Norton in studio, dedicating a segment to "Lady Gaga Day."  The discussion initially focused on Gaga's new album and a recent Howard Stern interview where she reportedly played piano and styled hair.  The conversation quickly transitioned to the dynamics of interviews, contrasting one-on-one settings with group interviews, using examples of past guests like Ozzy Osbourne and Paris Hilton (with vulgar references used to describe Hilton). Norton recounted his experiences interviewing celebrities, highlighting how the atmosphere differed depending on the context and the guest's familiarity with the show’s reputation.  A substantial portion of this segment detailed Norton’s frustrating attempts to secure a photograph with Lady Gaga, involving numerous SiriusXM employees and bureaucratic hurdles.  He compared this quest to his prized Black Sabbath photograph and described interactions with SiriusXM executives, including apologies and attempts to resolve the situation.  Norton also shared anecdotes about past celebrity encounters, including a negative experience with Paris Hilton and a humorous story about a publicist's blunder involving Jessica Alba. He voiced disappointment with Comedy Central's lack of opportunities for him.  Ron Bennington then joined the studio. The conversation circled back to Lady Gaga, including her Stern appearance and a claim about her alleged stressful behavior towards Clarence Clemons before his death.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Norton's obsessive pursuit of celebrity photos, recalling anecdotes and comparing his experiences with other celebrities.  This included his desire for a photo with Muhammad Ali and reflections on meeting high-profile individuals, including a president.  The hosts further discussed the hierarchy of celebrity and the perceived importance of various celebrities to one another.

The show then transitioned to a segment dedicated to Muhammad Ali’s immense cultural impact and charisma.  The hosts shared anecdotes illustrating his popularity, even internationally, contrasting it with his intensely competitive and often ruthless behavior, particularly towards Joe Frazier, using highly offensive racial slurs in recounting their rivalry.  Despite Ali's abuse, Frazier's generosity to a struggling Ali was noted. The conversation broadened to other competitive figures, including Jackie Gleason's aggressive behavior towards other comedians, like stealing the microphone from a struggling Richard Lewis, and Milton Berle's alleged habit of sabotaging fellow roast performers.  The hosts examined different approaches to fame and competition, noting some prioritizing personal success above all else.  The segment concluded with a humorous aside regarding a photograph, the absence of Fez, and a transition to the next show, with mention of a documentary about the "Thriller in Manila" fight between Ali and Frazier.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah!  Mix it up a little bit, huh, you rock?  Nice choice.  We're all going gaga today.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live, no matter what that sounds like.  That's a great song.  I don't care who you are. 
[00:00:30]  Eric, you haven't heard, have you heard this?  Or is this your first time?  This is the first time I've heard it.  What do you think of the song?  I haven't heard, this is great, I haven't heard much of the new album.  The new album has, I would say, at least nine, seven to nine excellent tracks.  Which I say, for an album, is quite an accomplishment.  We're, of course, talking about Lady Gaga, Born This Way, because today was Lady Gaga Day. 
[00:01:00]  Norton's back.  We're playing hair.  Put the headphones on.  You know, I just found out on Twitter, somebody Twittered me at NotSam, and they said that  she did hair on the piano in Howard's studio.  God damn it.  She's going to be a bunch of Howard fans this afternoon listening to his replay.  I would love to hear it.  Can we get a copy of that?  I'm sure we can.  Nagelmeister!  Yeah, I'll have it for you.  I would love to.  Were you talking to me?  You'll have it for me?  I guarantee you Howard did a good interview with her, too.  I'm sure he did. 
[00:01:30]  He gets stuff out of people.  I asked about it.  I've only met him a couple times.  But I mean, he knows he's a great interviewer.  But I'm like, dude, your interview is, I'm like, I'm such a starstruck asshole.  Yeah.  I think you said something about how it's just, yeah, I'm just interested in people.  Like, I really like learning this stuff.  I think it's number one, he doesn't get starstruck.  No.  And I also think that guests go into his studio ready to reveal.  Yeah.  Like, they're aware at this point in the game what's going to happen, what's expected of them.  He does have that reputation that he's going to ask you anything. 
[00:02:00]  And it's easier when you're one, it's really weird.  Like, when I've done my one-on-one interviews, like I did Ozzy and I've done a few of them,  it's much easier for me to ask a person something when it's just me and them.  I'm less nervous when it's just me and the person because I have no choice but to talk to the person.  Oh, when it's one-on-one.  One-on-one.  So, like, in here.  In here, it's harder to ask a tough question because there's three guys,  so you don't want it to seem like it's a gang-up mentality.  I'm much more aware of how things will be perceived here than I am one-on-one. 
[00:02:30]  Like, I'll ask a lot of questions one-on-one that I wouldn't ask.  Plus, one-on-one, you can kind of do your own damage control.  If something is not perceived the way you intended it to be, you can kind of start –  and you can take things in different directions, whereas in here, it's like it's just about the questions.  You get your question out because somebody else has a question to ask.  Yeah, and it's here.  It's a higher energy fucking around.  It's a different energy.  But one-on-one, when you're asking somebody something one-on-one,  I also think they can read what your intention is a lot easier because they're focused only on you and your questions. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, and they don't have – most of the people who have come in here have been at least briefed to our reputation of shock jockery.  So there are a lot of people – and you can tell when they come in here and they have their defenses on  because they're ready to – they're ready to be ganged up on.  So even when they're not – Paris Hilton, for example, even when they're not, they think that they're being attacked all of a sudden.  Well, she was atrocious, Paris Hilton.  She absolutely sucked.  I mean, even one-on-one, she would have been horrible.  She's vapid, and I hate to say that because it's predictable to say. 
[00:03:30]  You don't want to say what everybody else says.  But she really is a terrible, terrible, unrevealing –  But you weren't – you didn't say, oh, I have to interview this vapid person before she came in.  You were like, okay, I'm going to treat her like a human being.  We're going to talk.  This could be good.  This is going to – she's going to surprise people.  Then she turned out to be vapid.  She was a terrible cunt.  And the fun part about this room is that, like – and I was thinking this the other day,  and this may be a weakness of the show and it's also a strength.  But when I'm fucking around with Oprah and Ant and whoever we're talking to – like Uriah Faber. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Like I was making Uriah Faber laugh, and I wasn't thinking about what the radio audience is at all.  I literally was thinking only about the fucking Ope, Ant, and Uriah and the people in the room.  So they say our show is like eavesdropping into a conversation, and that's what it feels like.  So I think that's something that works for us and against us.  Yeah, I definitely think that's the vibe of the show.  But with that, it's like – because so few radio shows do that, when it works, it really works. 
[00:04:30]  And when it doesn't, it really doesn't.  It really doesn't.  Roland's coming back up the hallway.  Okay.  I hope he has some kind of update.  Yeah, I don't think there will be any bad news.  I have faith in her.  Marlo, I think her name is.  She's a good photographer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's always been good.  Roland.  No, she said she's working on it.  What's there to work on?  But then you have to be approved through her people.  They send them out.  The people said they can approve it.  But they can approve all of them, but they're just waiting.  Then she has to clean up the pictures.  How do you clean them up? 
[00:05:00]  Why don't you tell her not to clean up Jim?  I don't want mine cleaned up, but she'll just give them to me.  But she said she's swarmed with other things.  She had to get out to the press and do this and that.  Oh, okay.  So she said later on today, you basically go get it today.  But she said the big file?  I told her, I said, please save on the disc and send the big file.  If you can't send a big file, just give us a disc and we'll pick it up any time.  Yeah, just say that, you know, Jim just wants the raw file.  No touch-ups, no.  It would literally, I know she's busy and the press is the important stuff because you  got to get the press.  Yeah, well, that's what they're being pressured to.  But literally, if you take all these pictures and you just fucking throw them, like, while 
[00:05:30]  you're doing something else, you just take these three and you drop them on a disc.  It's not hard.  I know, but some people are just like, all right, no problem.  Well, and I guess it's not like you can be demanding now because you actually got the  picture.  Yeah, I mean, and I want to thank Scott Greenstein and Ross, but I want to get the picture before  I, you know, make a hundred, I mean, Ross did make that happen.  Ross is the guy who I was talking about.  I mean, I was out there when he was working with Roland and stuff and he was absolutely  from, from every time I was out there, he was a hundred percent involved saying, yeah, 
[00:06:00]  we're going to bring her here.  We're going to get Jim a picture.  It's like she had, the way Ross was talking, it seemed like, God, I had three things to  do today.  Yeah.  Go on Howard, go on the mashup, take a picture with Jim Norton.  Yeah.  She, um, and by the way, Opie, thank you for my, I just got a text from Opie.  Um, he said, uh, you haven't thanked me yet for your birthday present.  Well, I haven't gotten my birthday present yet right now.  Yeah.  I'll thank you for my tentative birthday.  Yes.  And we told you what the gift is, but having gave you the actual present. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  I, exactly.  He's right now the check's in the mail.  It's on back order.  Yeah.  It should get to you soon.  Yeah.  Like, what do you mean?  I sent it.  That's right now where we are with the gift.  Yeah.  If I printed it on Amazon, like that little picture, here you go.  And I understand she has to, they have to get the pictures approved.  Yeah.  They should be quick though.  But yeah, I'm not worried about that.  But either way, I want it, even though it's not approved, because it's going into my fucking  house.  Where am I going to put it?  Yeah.  If it didn't get approved.  Did they delete them all?  I wouldn't.  No, they're not.  They're not.  You didn't get them that time, Roland. 
[00:07:00]  I know.  I know I'll get it.  Because Sirius would rather have one of her publicists annoyed than deal with what they'd  have to deal with if that's a photo.  Everybody knows far too.  Because the thing is, and I was actually talking to Roland about this in the hallway, when you  got your favorite picture that you've ever gotten, I think, is your Black Sabbath, all  four members picture.  I'll never top that.  From the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame press conference.  And that's the one that Earl, Black Earl.  Took.  Yeah.  He hooked you up with.  And from that day, you treat him like he's one of your best friends. 
[00:07:30]  Like, he can do no wrong because he took that picture.  Earl took the greatest photo I'll ever get.  It's the photo.  And it's a photo that can never be replaced because they're all holding their Rock and  Roll Hall of Fame trophy.  So to me, it's a very personal.  It's a band I love.  They're all guys.  It's like everything was absolutely perfect.  But that said, if you had had that opportunity and Earl had been like, oh, no, I shouldn't.  I don't want to be involved with this.  You would have had hatred for him.  I would have shot Earl. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  So that's what SiriusXM realizes, that if they deleted that picture, like right now they're  in the good graces because you've got the picture.  If they now take it away, the shitstorm that they would have to deal with for months.  It would be.  I have to say, I'm almost embarrassed by how bad it would be.  Because you know.  Well, yeah, but I don't think they'll do that.  I don't think the company would be.  They're not being vindictive.  They helped me a lot.  Yeah.  In fact, this is almost like I felt like this is almost like a make good. 
[00:08:30]  So you knew that they weren't trying to be.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I did talk to Scott after that whole thing happened.  And you got to be reasonable.  I mean, the bottom line is he's the he's the president of the company.  He's not some fucking.  He's my boss.  So it's like, even though I'm annoyed at him, I still have to remember, all right, this  is the guy that I have to negotiate with.  And so when he brought me in and he apologized, he's like, look, it was a crazy day.  Plus, he's got the entire Sirius XM platform to deal with.  Yeah.  Aside from your picture with Lady Gaga.  And I do have to realize that.  But there's also a balance of, look, sometimes you just got to do the right. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  So he took me in and he's like, look, man, I'm really sorry that that happened.  And I'm like, hey, I mean, I was furious.  But I was like, hey, you're my boss.  Whatever you tell me, I don't care about being your boss.  He goes, I'm sorry that that happened.  And he was being genuine.  And I knew he was being genuine.  He wasn't being rushed.  So whatever, I can't be an idiot.  So I was like, okay, I appreciate that.  And then we talked.  And he goes, what would make things right?  And whatever.  He was being very today.  What would make things right was today.  What happened today?  He goes, you didn't email me.  He goes, whatever you've emailed me, haven't I always tried to help you out with what you 
[00:09:30]  asked?  And I thought back and it's like, all right, he had a point.  Yeah.  And I didn't email him.  So this time I emailed him and Steve and a bunch of them.  And Scott fired back an email.  He's like, I'm on vacation.  But he goes, he sent one to me.  He sent one to Ross.  And he goes to Ross, please try to make this happen if you can.  And then Ross goes, I'll try to make it happen.  And Ross made it happen.  And he did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they help.  It's like, again, when you beat the company up, but when they go out of their way to do  something fucking nice, I'm dabbling, by the way. 
[00:10:00]  But it is true.  You can't just sit here beating them up and then ignoring when they do good things.  You can't ignore when they do the right thing.  I mean, they're not the Death Star.  I mean, there's things they do that annoy me and enrage me.  But they also, at times, do the absolute right thing.  So you're still just waiting to see if you get that picture before you leave?  I don't know if I'll have it before I leave.  Probably not.  Wrong thing.  It doesn't seem like it.  Nah, she has to.  I don't mind them doing it.  I'll say it probably later on this afternoon.  That's fine.  Are you going to tweet it out?  If it's approved, I will. 
[00:10:30]  I wouldn't fuck the company by tweeting it if it wasn't approved.  Yeah, that would be a big fuck you after they got you the picture.  Nah, but I wouldn't do that.  I'm not that, you know.  But yeah, I think I'll tweet it if I...  If it's approved.  Sure.  I'm sure it'll be approved.  Why wouldn't it be?  Then you can print out, then call Logan and get a sign.  I don't want to bother Logan again, because Logan hasn't gotten back to me since last week.  So I hope everything's okay.  Maybe he was named president of OWN.  Huh?  He was named president of OWN last week. 
[00:11:00]  Was he?  Yeah.  So now he's president of Harpo and OWN.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  This is probably a little busy, then.  It was in the variety in Hollywood Reporter.  Wow.  Our old boss is the president of OWN, Oprah Winfrey's network, and Harpo Productions?  Oh, no wonder.  And Oprah named herself CEO.  So he's probably trying to save OWN.  Well, I know he was getting a bump, because my managers know somebody who's very close  to Oprah, even closer than Logan.  And it's a guy that used to run Viacom.  And he said, oh, Logan's moving up. 
[00:11:30]  He's moving up.  And he's double president.  They're just like, how long ago did Elo leave?  Three years ago?  And he's like chums with Oprah now.  He showed me a picture of fucking himself with the other co-president of Harpo, Michelle  and Barack Obama.  Oprah, because Elo told the story that when, because I was in the, his office is right next  to Oprah's office.  It's Oprah, and then it's him. 
[00:12:00]  And he showed me her office.  So fucking, he said that when it was all blacked out because the Secret Service was  there, when Obama was there, like you couldn't go in certain areas.  And, uh, but Oprah brought him in and she's like, no, no, no, come here.  I want Elo.  She was calling for him.  Right.  And that, I mean, you can't demand it because it is, uh, uh, a little over the top, but that's  what you want.  I mean, you want somebody in this company to be like, oh, Lady Gaga is here.  Jim, come here.  Get a picture.  Yeah.  Come, come meet.  Well, I just had this idea. 
[00:12:30]  Jim, come on.  Don't even ask.  Come here, Jim.  Take a picture.  You're a fan.  Yes.  Come meet, come meet the, uh, person.  But they, they did help me out.  And I'm not arrogant where I think I'm better than other employees.  I really don't.  Like, I know that everybody here would love to do that, but everybody here hasn't also  made an asshole out of themselves for the last decade doing that.  I have.  Yeah.  It's your thing.  I've been doing it for years.  It's what I do.  It is what it is.  It's humiliating.  I mean, you're not saying you're better than anybody else, but. 
[00:13:00]  I am.  If you can get something done easier than anybody else, it's not your problem.  I'm willing to.  You're just the one who's getting it done.  I'm willing to embarrass myself like a lot of other people are not.  Yes, you are.  Uh, going back to something you said, uh, that Sam brought up about how you analyze your  photos and what you look like in your photo.  I guarantee I look ugly in this one.  I don't remember who the celebrity was, but I called you back to when we were over at  57th to come back in the afternoon because somebody was coming up.  You're like, yeah, I'd like to get a photo.  So I hung around.  You got the photo.  Paris Hilton?  No, no.  That was, uh, at Jazz at Lincoln Center. 
[00:13:30]  This was some, I forgot the guy who it was, but we get into the elevator and you probably  didn't even know who it was.  You just heard it was a celebrity.  You rock.  So you thought you'd take a picture.  I wouldn't do that.  Jim.  So, um, no, Jim's all excited and he's like, oh, this was great.  Whatever.  And, you know, going down the elevator.  The Fantastic Four?  No, because that was the one Master Poe screwed up.  And he put his, I got the picture with him.  Oh, Pitts.  Yeah.  Master Pitts.  I never forget that when the publicist and our assistant goes, who is that guy?  I go, why?  Eric.  He just switted all over Jessica Alba.  Write that down because we have a bit, uh, talking about Master Poe and Jessica Alba. 
[00:14:00]  We'll play it tomorrow.  Yeah.  Um, I never, I remember Jessica Alba just going, just wipe me, just wipe me.  And I had to wipe her down.  He was sweating, plus he had the deodorant running down and he's wearing a tank top and puts  his arm right on her shoulder.  He's here?  Mm-hmm.  I'm doing his, I'm going to the Entourage premiere tomorrow.  You are?  Yes.  I mean, HBO is great to me.  They invite me to all the premieres.  That's always it.  HBO, The Tonight Show.  Everybody loves you.  No, HBO and The Tonight Show because I've worked with them.  Um, CBS, uh, ABC don't do anything for me. 
[00:14:30]  I don't think they'll be as kind as Larry David, though.  Comedy Central does nothing to me.  They hate you.  They do.  I know they do.  It's very strange.  They don't, I don't think they hate me, but they don't have any respect for me as an  artist and they will never put me on a roast.  They're roasting Charlie Sheen.  I know.  I'm not going to be asked to do it.  I've never been asked by that network.  Why is that?  I don't know.  Probably I'd say Paul Provenza and all those people.  Well, they'll ask guys.  I mean, Charlie Sheen has to approve them, too.  But, uh, I know they won't.  And they can always have reasons.  Well, you know, the day has to be approved by this and that. 
[00:15:00]  And I understand that.  And maybe not one celebrity has approved me to roast them.  I don't know.  But who, like, they're...  Bob Saget requested me.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, I don't really care anymore.  I'm at a point where they're just never going to like me at that network.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, Yorick.  Well, to finish what I was saying.  So you're in the elevator.  You're looking at the camera and you're like, oh, this is great.  You're great.  But as we're walking out to 57th, you just yell out of nowhere, why am I smiling like  that?  And I was like, what?  And the whole thing was fine.  And you're just like, ah, I don't like how I'm...  Look at how I'm smiling. 
[00:15:30]  I look retarded.  And it's like, you just got a great photo and you were fine.  Two minutes later, you started yelling.  I know, Yorick.  That's the way he is.  Because I'm unpleasant looking.  I don't think so.  I know you don't.  I think you're cute.  I'm fucking nudish.  I have a fat newt neck.  Nudish.  I think Nudish will be a little bit tougher than Leroy David.  Well, I've got all of them.  Oh, you did all Nudish?  Yeah.  Fucking Kevin Dillon, Adrian, whatever.  I got Connolly, I think.  Eric, are we out of time?  Yeah, we could go if you want. 
[00:16:00]  No, I'm asking you, are we out of time?  Or...  We should go.  Yeah, not do we have the option of leaving.  Exactly.  I could have left half an hour.  No one thought this was the gulag.  Eric, did you watch the pay-per-view last night?  Yes, I did.  Oh, my God.  It was so good.  Very good.  Money in the Bank.  Oh, God.  A lot of things I didn't think would happen, happened.  Yeah, well, you're horrible at predicting wrestling shows.  We might talk about that.  Eric is the worst at predicting wrestling.  For somebody who's watched wrestling...  He picks it wrong?  Not only does he pick it wrong...  His theories are long and winded.  He works out these long scenarios that would literally put WWE out of business. 
[00:16:30]  Like, he's like, this is what I think should happen.  And he works out this whole long thing that makes no sense.  Do you know more about wrestling than him?  Than Eric?  Yeah, I would cripple him.  Eric's the Jeff Zucker of wrestling.  Yeah.  He's horrible.  You would beat Eric in a...  Oh, yeah.  In any form of wrestling knowledge or...  Who do you think, besides Vince or someone like that, who would be able to beat you in  wrestling trivia?  Um...  I don't know many, like, wrestling historians. 
[00:17:00]  Not including writers or people that work for WWE.  I've never met anybody who I think could beat me in wrestling trivia.  At one point, I thought Fez, when he challenged me, would be a challenge.  But I've beaten Fez, you know, three times.  Whoa!  Hi, Ron.  We were just...  The great Ron Bennington is in studio.  We were just about to hand the reins over to you, because we're running out of time. 
[00:17:30]  We're running into your time.  He's...  I'm waiting for my photo.  Oh!  Yes.  Ron, I don't know if you knew this, but it's Lady Gaga day.  Yeah, now I do remember that it's Lady Gaga day, although everyone was all cleared out  down the stairs.  There's just, like, some confetti and stuff down there.  Leftover.  A couple of signs that are laying...  It is...  It was like, bye-bye birdie here today, though, huh?  It was just...  It was enormous.  And Jim, like, was stressed out.  At the beginning of the show, he was fine. 
[00:18:00]  Mm-hmm.  But he was getting his picture around 9, 9.30.  So around 8, 8.15 is when, you know, it really started to take over...  When I stand, I don't sit.  Right.  It started to take over his brain, and, like, whenever there was a lull in conversation,  Jim brought up something Lady Gaga related, because it was...  Right, yes.  It was there.  Now, I heard she played here today, too.  She did two songs on Howard.  I was so jealous.  That's one thing I would love to...  Not even...  I would just love to sit in a room and watch her play.  Well, you know, when she's by herself with the piano, that's my favorite...  She's great, right?  ...that she does, yeah. 
[00:18:30]  That, by far, I like that so much better than the dance and all that kind of stuff.  Because she has that kind of a 70s...  It's like an Elton, early Rod Stewart.  Absolutely.  I mean, she's got the whole singer-songwriter thing down.  But that's what I guess she did today.  It was just her and the piano, right?  Yeah, it was her...  She did two songs from the new album.  Hair and what else?  The single.  It's the one with Clarence in it.  Oh, the Edge of Glory.  Edge of Glory, yeah.  So that was the last thing that Clarence ever did.  It was.  After all those years with Springsteen. 
[00:19:00]  Wow.  He filmed the music video for Edge of Glory.  And that was it.  Do you think she pushed him too hard?  Yes.  I think so.  I mean, she's a workhorse herself.  And, you know, she expects perfection out of the people around her.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  She killed him.  Yeah.  Bruce lets him sit down in the chair and perform and she made him stand up.  Yeah.  And yelled Rachel epithets.  Yep.  And called him a lazy, you know.  And that's going to stress.  See, that's awful.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Made more costumes and whatnot.  I like when anybody will do something out of the way because I don't know whether you  guys are familiar with the great Solomon Burke, the soul singer from the 70s. 
[00:19:30]  He always sang in a chair because he was such a large man.  But when he came out with the stones, he walked out with a cane and was trying to do this  big 600-pound dance.  And did everybody flip out?  Place one crazy.  Yeah.  And then he gave his cape over to Mick Jagger and almost killed him because it was a large  man's cape.  The weight of the cape.  So these are the things.  These are the moments in rock where you're like, this is perfect.  Well, Clarence gave the Gaga.  Now Gaga has to give on to another generation. 
[00:20:00]  So that's the torch being passed right there.  We saw it.  That's what has to happen.  And one day there'll be some pop star and Lady Gaga will be on the stairs.  Robot.  Probably it'll be a robot.  They'll probably make a video game out of it or something.  It'll go directly into that.  Yeah.  Well, listen.  I'm sure you got a lot of Gaga talk to do on your own.  I really, I think I'm done.  I think that's everything I needed to do was right here.  You got that on your chest.  Did you guys have any other guests today or was it all just about Gaga?  We didn't have any guests today.  We had no guests at all.  We had a couple topics here and there.  Because it would be ridiculous to focus on anything but the biggest pop star in the world today. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  She was right down the hall from us.  She was sexy too, man.  She's really sexy in person.  Do you know that she used to be at Pianos when we used to sometimes do parties down there and stuff?  And we never paid any attention.  This is only about 2005.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  So remember the famous Pianos?  Yeah, of course.  That Danny did?  Yeah.  Danny?  I thought that was Baby Girl.  Hey, I met Baby Girl.  Okay.  It's Danny. 
[00:21:00]  So that was about the same time that she was there.  And then our listeners would go there and drink and not pay any attention to what was going on around them.  And a couple years later, people were falling themselves in the street.  Where's Pianos?  Lower East Side.  Oh, well, yeah.  But of course, everybody ignored her at Pianos.  She's like, yeah, I liked her when she was back at Pianos.  I was a big fan back then.  Well, now I'll tell nieces that I used to see her down there.  Please, don't even start on it.  Yeah.  I was a huge fan from way back.  Did you used to see her down there?  I don't remember if you recall, though.  But, you know, sometimes she sings in the Oak Room and does old jazz that's up right on Central Park South. 
[00:21:30]  So she'll go in there and do, like, these jazz standards as a kind of, I don't know, she'll drop, like, a Cher vibe.  Yeah.  And she does that, you know?  So she goes, like, unannounced?  Unannounced.  She's friends with either, like, the trumpet player or something, and she just drops in.  It's like you at the cellar.  Just boom.  She just comes in.  No big deal.  Mm-hmm.  And then, boom, out again. 
[00:22:00]  For the love of the game.  For the love of the game.  That's what it's all about.  I'd love to date her.  I think...  You think...  Did you pick up on something when it took you?  No.  Yeah.  The indifference I would have if someone took a photo of me in a rock was the same reverence she paid me.  All right, so not 100% bad.  But I'm dirty, so she would like me.  She would hate my body because I'm fucking disgraceful.  Don't put yourself down.  It's accurate, though.  I have to pay an accurate picture.  She would like the fact that I'm into piss and sweat and all this gross stuff that she probably is into. 
[00:22:30]  She would like that about me.  Yeah, but what if you started dating her and you found out she was just a normal girl?  This is all an act.  She's not weird at all.  I wouldn't believe it because as long as she had the vagina that I think she has, I wouldn't care if she was a fucking Mormon.  I would go with it.  And by that you mean meaty.  Now, by the way that you're saying this, though, you're acting like if you say that you're something that you're not.  See, I disagree.  I think if you put on the act, that's the person that you are.  And that's just not me saying that. 
[00:23:00]  That's Kurt Vonnegut, which will come up later today and unmasked as I explain that to Paul Provenza.  But the thing is, like, if you play the character of Manson, right, if you're just saying I'm Marilyn Manson, that's who you are.  You're Marilyn Manson.  You know, you can't hide it then behind all that's just a stage character.  Right.  You know?  Yeah, I guess if you spend more of your life being a character than you did the person you were before the character.  Even if you don't.  Even if you just say, I go on stage, this is how I present myself, and this is how I think, that's also you. 
[00:23:30]  How is Provenza?  Oh, did you not talk to him yet?  No, I did.  And he was good?  I thought he was terrific.  He's a really, really smart guy.  Cool.  And this was actually the Unmasked that we did over the weekend, but I'm going to play it again today.  But, yeah, he is.  He's a bright guy.  And he's got it into his own scene now.  He's like, he did a bunch of Hollywood stuff years ago, and he's like, whatever.  Now I'm just going to do what I want to do. 
[00:24:00]  Now they're doing that Green Room show, which they had me booked on and then canceled me and never rebooked me.  Why, they don't like you either?  Don't know.  But I know that when they wanted to come on and promote on Opie and Anthony, you could bet who vetoed that to me.  Nope.  So proud of myself.  We don't forget, do we?  The little petty veckin' vengeance.  Yeah.  Now, I know he likes you, though.  I think he likes me, too, on a personal level.  He brought it up.  But you think Showtime was behind?  Or just another exec producer.  I don't think it was Paul personally.  Yeah.  Because I think he does.  No, he said he's a fan. 
[00:24:30]  He told me he's a fan.  He likes what you're doing.  Yeah.  It was actually even in his, he does this book of, like, interviews.  And I'm trying to think of who he was bringing you up of, somebody that he likes to keep his eye on.  Oh, it was Janine Garofalo, when those two were talking.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He said that you're doing, you're in your own scene right now and you're doing your own thing.  And it's very, very cool.  Oh, thank you.  So, and then I said to him, well, then why did he nix you off the ONA show?  I don't think Janine likes me. 
[00:25:00]  I haven't really, no interaction with Garofalo except for Tough Crowd.  We did one of the pilot episodes in 2002 and she thumbs down me when I attacked Rosie.  Yeah, I think, I think that if she, it wouldn't be based on comedy, it would just be based on politics if she doesn't like you.  Yeah, or also my comedy is probably too mean for her, what she interprets as mean.  I'm guessing, I haven't, I mean, I saw her at Bonnaroo a couple years ago, we said hello.  Do you ever question your act, whether or not, when you hear, when you get the sense that people don't like you because of your act, 
[00:25:30]  does it ever make you question your act, like maybe I should lighten up?  But it's not paranoid to say that the politics of your act or the tone of it or what you attack does affect it.  Because on Tough Crowd, we attacked a lot of things that they didn't really want to attack as much on Comedy Central and that did affect things.  I know it did.  I'm not a paranoid, like look at the things that people get in trouble for or what Tracy had to apologize for and what other comics don't have to.  Yeah.  It all depends on what people in Hollywood see as being rebellious.  They still see attacking the church as being like a maverick, but it's not 1965. 
[00:26:00]  Nobody gives a fuck anymore.  But you've never had the urge to change what you do to try to get more success.  No, I look back at, like, I hate your guts and I think, eh, man, some of that was a little bit mean.  Like, I wish I hadn't attacked Hillary Clinton as hard, and I suffered no repercussions.  Nobody cared.  I just kind of wish I didn't.  Just on a personal level, now that you've had a chance to think about it more, you mean?  Yeah.  Because I saw that you put that Twitter up that E-Rock had interviewed you, and then you replayed it, where you were like, the war's over, fuck all the hippies. 
[00:26:30]  I thought it was great that you put it up, but then on the other day...  I didn't put it up, but I just retweeted it.  Well, I thought it was great that you said, look, check this out, I was fucking wrong here.  Sure.  Because that's, you know, being a real performer, it's not saying, oh, I'm the smartest fucking person who ever lived.  Yeah.  I've been right all along.  Yeah, I mean, I don't think you ever want to be the kind of person who doesn't change your mind.  That would be fucking insane.  Of course.  Comedians who get obsessed with being right are not funny.  They're pompous and they're preachy. 
[00:27:00]  I bat 500 like every other dumbbell in the fucking building.  It's half the times I'm right, half the times I'm wrong.  All you got to do is be honest.  It's like, you know, I was wrong.  I thought the war was over.  I bought it, and I was like, fuck everybody.  You were wrong.  And you know what?  They were right, and I was wrong.  How can I deny that?  But I thought the other thing that was great is, and this must have been like eight years old, is how much your inflections have changed.  Like you're just speeding through like an interview, just, you know, and I'm like, wow.  Because everybody always pays attention to the way people like change physically. 
[00:27:30]  But when you work in radio, if someone gives you old tapes, and you're just like, I can't talk.  Humiliating.  What was I doing then?  Is that because we had been off the air for so long that you didn't know how to talk?  No, it's just your personality is different in those days.  You feel like you have to get things out quicker when you're younger, and then, you know, once you've been around this, you're in no real hurry.  Like, I'd done a lot less interviews at that point, and I was happy that I had something going on, finally, with Tough Crowd.  I really was, I really wanted to throw myself out the window. 
[00:28:00]  I was like, automatically depressed when we got kicked off the air.  So, like, it was a big deal when you got the call that the sex bagel wanted to interview you.  I wouldn't go that far, but I was happy that somebody was talking to me.  It was my first time in the market, and I think I wasn't drawing at all in West Palm.  I had terrible crowds, like, small.  Eric, was that an exciting day for you?  Very exciting.  West Palm represent?  Yes.  Nice.  Did he come to the show?  Yeah, I went to the show.  Was it funny?  Yeah, Jim was great.  Good.  Yeah, I look back on my old stuff, and I'm just like, ugh. 
[00:28:30]  Only now he won't come to the show.  Then he was always happy, though.  Now it's like, God, I don't want to fuck this guy.  This is awful.  He's over it.  All right, well, it is Ryan Fez time.  Yes, it is.  They got a lot of Gaga talk to get to.  You got your pictures?  Is it done?  I haven't gotten it yet, because the woman from Sirius, who's a good photographer, took it.  So I'm hoping just to get on a dinner.  But I hate when they send me files that are like 125 megabytes.  It's like, give me the fucking...  It should be about two megabytes.  Oh, two megabytes.  I'm sorry.  What's the smaller one? 
[00:29:00]  KB.  Kilobyte.  KB.  Yeah, I want a big picture.  You want a giant picture?  I want a fucking file that I can blow up.  Right.  You know, I hate that, because it's pixelates.  Yeah.  So I'll let you know tomorrow.  I can't wait.  Me neither.  She loves it.  She was fucking turning me on, man.  That little, like, fucking plastic leather outfit.  Yeah.  It's either plastic or leather.  Is this all you wore for her?  The Gottmule shirt?  You didn't have anything?  You didn't think to yourself, oh, today's the day I'm supposed to get the picture.  What will I wear?  I did, but it doesn't matter. 
[00:29:30]  I did think about this.  I actually chose this.  So Gaga would be like, hey, that's a really witty.  Yeah, that's interesting.  What is that?  Yeah, come on the tour bus.  What does that mean?  Well, you know what?  It's funny you should say that, Steph, because I thought it was a mule as in a penis, but it  turns out it was a government mule shirt at Bonnaroo.  Yeah, yeah.  No, you're right.  I was doing comedy.  But it didn't happen that way.  It didn't go down.  Put her arm out.  I stood there, and she couldn't have gotten away faster.  Because you thought that would charm her.  I bought a t-shirt of a band because I thought it meant penis. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, that would be very charming.  Just dropping the name Bonnaroo would be all exciting.  Oh, yeah, I was a Bonnaroo.  I don't know if you've heard.  I should have put my Who Farted hat on.  I thought I was really interesting and funny.  Because if there's one thing that you could always tell a guy who's funny if his t-shirt  is funny.  Yeah.  You know, if his t-shirt gives you a laugh, this is a funny guy.  I would have had more integrity if I just walked up to her and pointed at it and went,  huh?  Huh?  What do you think?  Huh?  You should have worn a Gaga t-shirt.  Yeah, look at her.  She's cracking up, my best.  I really am Gervais from The Office. 
[00:30:30]  I'm just a fool.  It's always best, too, when you meet a performer that says, your music saved my life, I think.  Yeah.  It saved my life.  You have no idea what you did for me.  Yeah.  Okay.  Nice to meet you.  It really is.  I had a guy cry when he met me one time.  Me and Kenny were in Providence, Rhode Island.  And a guy at the end of the show with his wife came up and he's just crying.  I was happy to meet you.  I've never had that before or since.  Thank God.  Well, it's weird.  You get those kind of emails when you're working radio because people listen to you  every day.  But you get that, you know, you were the only person there for me all through my brain cancer. 
[00:31:00]  It's like, I'd rather keep it anonymous.  What's even better is this guy comes up to Norton crying saying, you saved my life.  If there had been another celebrity that was above Norton in the room, he was, yeah, great,  great, great, trying to get a picture with the celebrity instead of this guy who's  crying over him.  Believe me, that's the part that I really would have brushed him in his tears aside.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  Blow your nose.  I'll be over in a minute.  This is just obsession stuff with you, though.  It's like...  Part of it, yeah.  With her, it's like I'm genuinely a fan.  Like, I like her.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  But a lot of it is obsessive and it's become a thing.  And the way I look at it is sometimes I get like when Diana Ross blew me off for a  photo.  I got like a bit out of it.  Sometimes I don't get a bit out of it.  You know, sometimes it's just a moment that means nothing and other times it becomes something  funny.  You know, but it's always a moment in life that you can or can use if it's worth using  on stage.  I've done quite a bit.  My favorite moments are the ones that happen every now and then around here, but they'll  also happen like we're going out to Comic-Con again this week.  And it'll happen around there where there are a lot of celebrities milling about, so you 
[00:32:00]  never know.  So Norton will say, who's that guy?  Is that guy famous?  Oh, yeah.  You have to tell.  Oh, he has one of Jimmy with, I think, Wavy Gravy.  Yeah.  Should I get a picture?  Who is it?  Afterward, Wavy Gravy.  What a stupid name.  After the guy walks away.  It's funny.  I, uh, uh, I, when I do, like a lot of times I'll interview people like for the ESPYs that  we don't use or from where I interviewed all the jockeys from, uh, the Kentucky Derby for  Leno and I'll have the tech guy give me a screen grab of every person I interviewed, even if 
[00:32:30]  we don't use them.  Just in case.  Yeah, because I, it's hard to get photos when you're doing a film thing.  You're like an asshole posing for a picture.  It's also funny because you always, Norton always says, like, for me, I always think  that getting a picture at the end of it is like a letdown because you're like, this person  doesn't give a shit who I am and you just take a picture.  Whereas Norton, he says that he'll take a picture with a celebrity and then if the celebrity  tries to talk to him after the picture is taken, Norton's like, we're, like, we're done.  Like, that was all I wanted. 
[00:33:00]  No interest.  This interaction's done.  No interest.  Obi tells a story of when I was, I was doing a Tonight Show once and Ben Affleck was the  lead guest.  So he just came into the dressing room.  My dressing room is going to say hi.  And, uh, I'm like, oh, hey, can we take a picture?  He's like, yeah, yeah, sure.  And that just kind of ended the conversation.  Like, I have no interest in them as people.  Like, I don't want to be their friends or go to the movies, but there's no need for it.  And you weren't upset that you ended the conversation.  What do you do with the pictures, though?  Just keep them.  Yeah.  You know, what is a, what is a, what is a, what is a murderer doing with a hooker's driver's license?  He just looks at it once in a while, runs his fingers over it.  But do you, when you look at it, do you think, ah, what a life I've lived? 
[00:33:30]  Sometimes I do, actually.  Yeah, you know what?  It's like, I'm prone for depression.  Right.  And it's almost like, it's like, it's a very visual reminder of, hey, you dumb fuck.  You have a fun life.  Shut up.  Take away of kicking myself in the ass.  Like, you idiot.  You're like living like a giant child.  What are you complaining about?  I just have this picture of you and you're all depressed and you're in like some kind of a  silk robe drinking a martini.  And finally, you put the pictures up, huh?  Oh, yeah.  It's very, it's like getting very glorious Swanson after a while. 
[00:34:00]  When that depression kicks in, though, and you feel better looking at your pictures, if  you find somebody that's got a better picture collection than you or has a picture with  I don't think there is one.  Oh, there is.  But if like you find somebody with a picture with some of the presidents, do you go, oh,  I fucking suck again, like you're back in that depression?  No, because they're not, I mean, I'm not in that circle.  It's like, I would love to have those pictures, but they're hard to get and I know how people  get them.  Like I know, I know a couple of people have Obama photos, but they wrote for Seth Meyers 
[00:34:30]  when he did the correspondence dinner or they wrote for Wanda when she did her.  You know, those are hard photos to get.  I'm not in those circles.  $1,500.  It'll cost you $1,500 to go to any of those dinners and you get a free picture with them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's when you see like, oh, $1,500 a plate, Republican, whatever.  And those, all those people stand in line and they're basically buying a picture with the  president.  Oh, I didn't know that they all got pictures.  Yeah.  Well, it depends on if you got to be in the whatever seal or, you know what I mean?  But there's certain ones that come with, you get a moment.  Probably $30,000 a plate. 
[00:35:00]  I would say more than $1,500.  No, no, no.  You'd be surprised.  It's really not all that expensive.  And it really is just a signing.  It kind of is a signing.  Yeah, I mean, you're really not there for the chicken and he says a short speech.  You get it done.  And then, you know, the thing is, if you're in Iowa and you've got a picture of you next  to the president in your fucking insurance place, it's going to impress the hayseed.  It's like going to a baseball card store to meet Pete Rose.  It's not that different.  No.  Yeah.  But they raise, you know, ridiculous amounts of money.  Both parties run the same gimmick. 
[00:35:30]  The only problem is, is if you ever do it, they never leave you alone again.  They just ask for it over and over.  Oh, I got you.  Because you're suddenly the rube that they know they can hit up for cash.  Now, do you have a, is there a great white whale still out there for you that you, someone's  picture that you need to have?  Ali.  Muhammad Ali.  That's a smart call.  And I have, besides the president, obviously, I know people who know Ali pretty well.  So I'm trying to get an interview with his wife. 
[00:36:00]  Um, I would love to interview her.  Because, you know, he'll be there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would love to be in Ali.  Now, have you ever met a standing president while they're president?  I have not.  I've never met any president.  Um, no.  Governors as high as they're regardless.  There's no bigger excitement level.  Like all, like sometimes you'll be in show business things and there's a buzz.  I had to do a thing where I brought Bush's dad out while he was president.  It was actually a radio gig.  And the electricity was fucking popping in the air because, and it, you know, it was 
[00:36:30]  just because it was the president of the United States.  People were just buzzing the whole.  And I'm thinking this guy travels around like that.  And I was there before you had to show up like three hours before and we were all just  like hanging out backstage and all we had to do is do some shit where we brought him  up.  And all the secret service guys were just regular guys.  Some of them were like, just like Jersey guys.  We were talking about different things.  And then, and this was like an outside thing and the motorcade was pulling up and all of 
[00:37:00]  a sudden you could feel, it felt like a storm was coming in.  Right.  And all the guys that I was fucking talking to stood up and glared at me.  All the secret service guys just turned into like bad attack dogs and just fucking glared  at everyone that was in the room.  Like I want to see anyone fuck up.  Right.  It was the weirdest shit.  I mean, you literally could feel electricity in the air.  Well, they're protecting the biggest target on earth.  Right.  I mean, maybe the Pope would be, but I mean, they're, they're literally protecting somebody 
[00:37:30]  that a lot of people really want to kill.  And if it, if it fucks, if they fuck up or anything, they're in history for fucking up.  And that day, uh, it was Ron Diaz and myself, we had to do introductions and stuff and we  were supposed to exit stage left and we exit stage right and walked right into the president.  We did one of those, like, Oh, do we go left?  Do we do right?  And he was doing the same thing and we came off stage and those guys were fucking furious.  And they're like, never let this happen again. 
[00:38:00]  I go, never again.  What are you talking about?  I'm heading out that fucking door.  Yeah.  And you're never going to see me again.  This is the end of the whole scene.  It must be so stressful, like living a life where human interaction is not a possibility.  Like things have to be scheduled and scripted.  Like if this happens, it can't.  But he's standing next to the whole time that I'm watching, I'm coming in and standing there.  The fucking general with the briefcase with all the launch codes is just standing there.  Like what the fuck?  Jesus.  You know, and like later tonight, I got to call a naughty nighty contest. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Fucking Dunedin.  You know, this is ridiculous.  This shouldn't even be happening.  And where do you go from that?  Like there's this big high, like, yeah, we're introducing the president.  And then, like you said, you're back to do a naughty nighty contest.  But they say the depression even sets in on any president once he's out.  I would imagine.  Yeah.  That they just feel like anything worth living is gone.  I mean, when you think about it, even at a base level, when you become the president,  you're automatically the biggest celebrity in the world.  And then when you're not the president anymore, somebody else is. 
[00:39:00]  Then again, they also, but then you're number two.  Because there really is nothing like, the only one that doesn't feel like he'd have the same buzz as Carter,  because he was a bit of an ass and he's been out since 1980.  Yeah.  But Bill Clinton?  Yeah, but here's the thing.  Bill Clinton's a celebrity, but they don't shut the fucking airport down with him.  They don't shut every block.  Like, when the president comes into town, he doesn't see a fucking red light.  Ever.  For eight years.  He doesn't stop at a red light.  He doesn't fucking start a car. 
[00:39:30]  Everything changes, you know?  And it's just like, you know, he scratches his head and fucking a doctor comes over and everything.  Right.  What is that?  Let me just take a look at it.  And then you leave and you have to remember how to interact as a person again.  Well, they said Eisenhower, when he got out, didn't fucking understand how phones worked anymore.  Oh, my God.  And he picked up the phone and he said, hello, get me.  And he just heard a dial tone.  He was telling somebody just to connect him.  So he was just going, get me the, hello, hello, what's wrong with this phone? 
[00:40:00]  And they're going, there's nothing wrong with the phone.  It is a phone.  It's not the magic phone we've been handing you for years.  The VIP level, they're just the way, like, McCartney's a big, like, in music, McCartney's as big as you can get musically.  There's nobody bigger.  The way I react to Lady Gaga is the way she would react to McCartney.  Right.  Like, he, it's like a weird hierarchy.  Yeah.  He, uh.  And she would probably have to wait on the line if she wanted to meet him.  If she wanted a picture with him, uh, she would have to be brought in and wait for him. 
[00:40:30]  And just like when Metallica, when Lars called up and said when they opened for Metallica, when they opened for the Stones.  Yeah.  Metallica's a big fucking band.  They had to be taken into an area and wait for Nick and the Stones to come out.  The Stones photographer takes the picture and if they approve it, then you get it.  But they waited for the Rolling Stones the way we would wait for Metallica.  And they were working with him.  They were on tour with him.  They opened for them.  So it is that, and the president, everybody is that way for him.  Everybody.  This is the other thing that the Stones do, and I think this is the funniest fucking thing in show business.  They always have this massive 100-yard fucking stage, right? 
[00:41:00]  But when you open, and huge bands, like you said, open for them, they only get, like, one small part of it.  And they don't get the monitors and shit like that.  They curtain everything off?  Like, so they get this call and it's like, hey, you're going to open for the Stones.  And, you know, it must sound great.  And they're like, fuck, this is what we dreamt about our whole life.  Us and the Stones.  But then they can treat it like shit by the Stones.  And it's Metallica.  It's not like something.  Yeah, right.  I mean, like, the Stones haven't had anybody that hasn't been, you know, fantastic open for them in, like, fucking 40 years. 
[00:41:30]  Uh-huh.  They just don't go grabbing people off the street.  Yeah.  You know, it's normally, look, we can take who you guys think is great and put them right here.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Right where we want them.  Well, there are also, the Stones, when they're selling an arena, they are 100% of the draw.  It's not like, hey, let's tour together and sell it out.  They're all Stones fans.  Whoever is opening is irrelevant.  And they will fucking, they threw fucking shit at Prince, Justin Timberlake, Van Halen. 
[00:42:00]  Did they really?  Yeah.  They threw Prince, it was probably 79, 80, very early on.  But they booed fucking Van Halen off the stage when they were Van Halen in the, like, 1980, 81 tour.  The people were just like, we're here to fucking see the Stones.  Yeah.  It's not fucking around.  Did they boo Metallica?  I don't know about that one.  But they get fucking, you know, this is what they've been waiting for.  The Rolling Stones.  Yeah, they're really weird. 
[00:42:30]  It's like, I always think of guys that can, like, the guy, when we saw them at McCartney at the Apollo,  like Keith Richards and Ron Wood were there.  Yeah.  And they went back to see him.  And like, those are guys that could walk in the room and be comfortable with McCartney.  Yeah.  You know, they're not, they're not, they're not impressed with McCartney.  Right.  They're as close to him as you can get without being him.  Here's one where you're talking about who's the biggest celebrity.  I'm at a fight.  It was either a Tyson fight or a Holyfield fight in Vegas.  And this would have been mid to late 90s.  And there was 100 fucking celebrities show up there. 
[00:43:00]  And only one person did the whole place fucking turn around and watch walk in Jack Nicholson.  Yeah.  Jack Nicholson, all the fucking celebrities, you saw them doing the, there's a celebrity over there thing.  Yeah.  Adjusting their seats.  And we were cracking the fuck up.  And Jack just comes in in a pair of fucking shades, sits down, and the fight starts.  Like, okay, I'm here, start the fight.  And instantly, like, the 100 celebrities that you were just looking at, like, wow. 
[00:43:30]  When you, once you see them looking at Jack Nicholson, you're like, oh.  No, it was fucking funny, though.  Yeah.  It was very, very funny to see them going, there's a fucking celebrity here.  Right.  This was great.  Although, even in a room of presidents, you know, Vic Henley's a comedian.  He tells a funny story about having done a thing with Bush Sr.  Ali is still kind of the one everybody looks at.  Like, because any sitting president wants to walk over and pay homage to Ali more than he wants to pay homage to them.  Like, if Obama and Ali were in the room, Obama would be happy to walk over. 
[00:44:00]  Because Obama's not a childhood hero of Ali.  Right.  Of course.  Muhammad Ali, when he was the, and people don't remember how fucking big boxing was.  Boxing was enormous.  Take, you know, when there was a fucking big fight with Ali, the whole country would be talking about it constantly.  Yeah.  He said, I think it was to Howard Cosell, I go anywhere in the world with no money.  I'll just travel the world saying, take me with you.  Hey, I want to come in and sleep in your house tonight.  It doesn't matter if I'm in fucking Kenya. 
[00:44:30]  It doesn't matter where I go, China, and I will be welcomed.  It's amazing.  And he fucking knew that about himself.  He knew that not only did they look at him that way, but people actually were like, I would like to help Muhammad Ali.  He knew he had that fucking thing in people.  Yeah, he had such a bigger effect in boxing.  It's like, even countries that hate us love Ali.  They respect him because he told the U.S. government to go fuck itself.  He didn't fight.  You know, he's got that vibe.  And I've heard stories that when he does stuff with the NBA, just the teams, the whole fucking, everyone that we want photos with, run over like children and take a picture with him. 
[00:45:00]  When Earl was a little kid, Ali went walking through his neighborhood and all the fucking black kids all came running outside.  And this was when Ali was the champion.  He was just walking through Earl's neighborhood.  Earl's got this fucking great story about it.  But when I was a kid, Joe Frazier was the champ.  And in Philadelphia, Ali showed up outside of his fucking thing and was like yelling at him like a wrestling thing.  And all the Philly kids were gathered around Ali and going fucking crazy. 
[00:45:30]  Really?  Yeah.  And I mean, like, can you imagine, like, if the Giants came down to where the Eagles fucking practiced?  Yeah.  You know, people would kick their ass.  But they went fucking crazy for Ali.  They love him.  And when you see the thriller in Manila, it was, we had Frazier in for that.  Oh, the documentary.  It was great.  Yeah, it was great.  But you really do feel for Frazier.  Like, I mean, Ali is terrible.  Yeah, he really was shitty to Frazier for real, like beyond where he should have gone to promote a fight.  Well, there's a lot of guys who always know, like, their position. 
[00:46:00]  There's a lot of comedians have done it.  Gleason has done stuff to people that, you know, like, hey, why we're here.  I want to make sure I'm the one who gets over.  You know what I mean?  And what did Gleason do?  Richard Lewis tells this fucking story about when he was on stage and Gleason came walking up drunk and took the mic off him and said, let me show how it's done, kid.  Milton Berle is another guy who's known, was known to be very competitive with other comics.  Yeah, like at the roast.  Somebody even said that, like, he would pinch people while they were fucking doing their roast stuff, just trying to fucking throw them off if they were getting too big of a laugh. 
[00:46:30]  So wait, was Gleason funny when he took the mic?  Yeah, he was Gleason, you know what I mean?  Like, he was a giant fucking star.  And he just went up and just took the fucking mic off a young comic that was dying at the time.  Oh, he was dying.  Yeah, well, he was fucking struggling.  He was new.  But it was just some guys feel like they need 100% of the attention. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, that's a little annoying.  Yeah.  It's a little annoying.  Although I think with Ali it went into a real hatred of Frazier.  But there are some guys that don't care where they are in the business unless they're first.  And they don't care if they've got the respect of the people behind them or whatever, the people that came before them.  They just have to be number one.  And I think Ali had that when he was younger.  I think he definitely felt like, fuck Frazier, fuck everybody else.  It's about me.  And I think as he got older, he got a little sweeter. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, maybe so.  But he really was fucking calling him a gorilla.  He really was vicious to Frazier.  Frazier was nice to him.  Gave him money when he was out of boxing.  Frazier gave him some money.  And Ali just motherfucked him for real and then didn't even apologize.  He called his kid into the dressing room and apologized to his kid.  Frazier hates him.  You want to talk about a guy who's not starstruck by Ali?  Frazier.  Because he spent 45 rounds punching him in the face.  He hates Muhammad Ali.  You saw in the documentary to this day, on Frazier's voicemail, he does some poem about Ali. 
[00:48:00]  He's insulting Muhammad Ali on his voicemail to this day.  Harvey Parkinson's, yeah.  He's saying, guess who put him like that?  Frazier takes full credit.  Right.  And Frazier's a little loopy, too, let's be honest.  He's not exactly in the fucking finest.  When he came in here, he just started singing.  Every 15 minutes, he just started singing a song.  Dude, he used to have a fucking band.  And they used to tour around.  It was the Joe Frazier's and the something.  Oh, right.  I worked at a fucking hotel when I was a kid.  And Frazier and his band were staying there.  And they had like fucking nine rooms. 
[00:48:30]  And then one night, they all went out the window.  It was a fucking great...  And this wasn't, you know...  It probably wasn't within fucking 10 years that he was world champ.  Yeah.  You know?  What does that mean?  They didn't pay the bill?  Yeah.  They just fucking disappeared in the middle of the night.  Just fucking all of them.  Just fucking went out a second story window and into the fucking car.  Took off.  Yeah.  There probably wasn't a credit card down for incidentals back in those days.  Everybody's like, Joe Frazier's here.  This is great.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll let Ron and Fez do their thing. 
[00:49:00]  You better.  They're coming up next.  Jim, we'll find out about your picture tomorrow.  Or we keep checking your Twitter tonight.  Yeah, I will.  We might get to see it.  I'm going to ask Roland now.  It's already 11.27.  The photo was taken about two hours ago.  Did it come out?  You think it came out?  Yeah.  We can't know.  I think so.  I imagine it did.  I can't see why it wouldn't.  Yeah, I mean.  If it didn't, there's going to be a woman here with broken hands.  Believe me, there's going to be a human resources issue.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  So we snap the photographer's wrists.  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.  We'll be back tomorrow, as will Opie and Anthony, when we find out about the picture.  I was wondering where Fez was.  He hasn't come in for this?  No.  He hasn't liked Sam.  Is that it?  I don't blame him.  Whatever.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez is coming up next. </pre>
