<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a flurry of "Thank you"s, immediately followed by chaotic mayhem involving spilled poker chips and a heated argument between Opie and a woman he derisively called a "guinea brat," punctuated by derogatory language.  The hosts then reviewed the previous day's show, deeming it "cringe radio" due to its wild and unpredictable nature. They discussed technical issues, including headset problems, and complaints about the show being "too sexy," a criticism they dismissed as unfounded. Listener feedback was addressed, including complaints about a lesbian-themed segment and the "Guess What's in My Pants" segment. The hosts also discussed their new studio, its features, and plans for future renovations, including transforming the outside area into a club.

Opie detailed his ongoing feud with the building's doorman, recounting an angry confrontation where the doorman threatened repercussions for Opie entering without his security card.  A video of the poker chip incident was mentioned, with Opie describing his uncontrollable laughter. Several listener calls followed, with callers sharing their experiences with the show, often using offensive language.  The poker chip incident was revisited, with Opie and Anthony playfully assigning themselves "good cop" and "bad cop" roles.  An update on a Sacramento couple's delayed paperwork was given, followed by Opie reading an email from a listener who illegally streamed the show and whose masturbation was interrupted by his mother during a sexually explicit segment.  This led to a lengthy, explicit discussion about the hosts' childhood masturbation experiences. They also discussed their mothers' reactions to the show, and Opie shared a story about his father setting him up with a 19-year-old woman when he was 13, referring to her as the "town whore." He also discussed his childhood in California and a brief stint as a cowboy.  The segment concluded with a planned appearance by comedian Pablo Francisco and a mention of an email concerning a perceived marital conflict between Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne.  A snippet of John Valby's inappropriate performance in a Steinway showroom was played.

Anthony then recounted his first sexual experience at 13 with a 19-year-old woman nicknamed "Buzz," providing graphic details. This led to further explicit discussions of his and his brother Joe's youthful sexual exploits, including detailed descriptions of "Buzz" and other women.  A listener's concern about Ozzy Osbourne's marriage prompted a phone call with Ozzy himself, who revealed he was considering divorce from Sharon due to her past infidelity with Randy Rhodes and ongoing marital problems, expressing a desire for a younger partner.  The show included a humorous song about "Special Ed," a discussion about the New York accent, and advertisements for XM Satellite Radio and Alienware computers. A call with Anthony's brother, Joe, added further details about their childhood sexual encounters and unconventional upbringing, culminating in a story about their arrest in New York after a cross-country bus trip. Joe also promoted his upcoming musical performances.

The show continued with a discussion about finding a more approachable coworker to replace the intimidating Steve. Technical issues with their XM equipment were also mentioned.  The conversation shifted to guest appearances: Pablo Francisco performing at Caroline's and the anticipated arrival of women from "New York Confidential."  A significant portion involved a caller and the hosts discussing their Grand Theft Auto 5 gameplay, detailing violent acts and interactions with prostitutes.  Further calls focused on unpleasant bus trip experiences. A caller recounted losing a colostomy bag at a comedy club, followed by promotional announcements for Ray Charles and Richard Pryor programming on XM.  The "New York Confidential" women's delayed arrival, due to paperwork, and the studio's security, including "secretary/killer" Master Poe, were discussed.  Pablo Francisco's performance was again mentioned. The women finally arrived, and there was playful anticipation of their actions on the "lesbian couch," along with a brief interview discussing their work and lifestyle, including a recent private jet trip to Los Angeles.  Sexually suggestive comments and references permeated this segment.

A studio visit from Natalia and other women from NYConfidential.com ensued, characterized by highly sexually charged conversations and graphic descriptions of sexual acts.  The hosts encouraged the women to disrobe, and the conversation frequently veered into sexually explicit territory and crude jokes, including speculation about Jimmy Norton's sexual experiences.  The women's impending private jet trip to Los Angeles was extensively discussed. A call with an irate customer arguing with a repo man, filled with profanity and insults, was also featured.  Pablo Francisco's guest appearance was noted, with the hosts expressing some dissatisfaction with his performance. A heavily edited audio clip, allegedly featuring George W. Bush using racial slurs, was played.  The segment concluded with further sexually suggestive commentary about the NYConfidential.com women and a discussion of the show's content.

The final excerpt began with a discussion of the studio's surprisingly robust security features, including bulletproof glass, Kevlar lining, and a hidden elevator. Norton, a security detail member, was a source of amusement. A caller questioned Al Sharpton's Vegas wedding. The arrival of a Jägermeister machine and its "Jägorettes," and the late arrival of recurring guest Earl, were highlighted.  Earl's appearance led to further discussion of Al Sharpton's marriage, fueled by an unflattering picture of his wife.  Earl's habit of avoiding restaurant bills was also discussed.  A bit featuring an audio clip from *The Presidential Apprentice* was played before a break. After the break, a discussion of rap music's violent lyrics and changing societal attitudes followed, interspersed with XM Satellite Radio advertisements.  Listener calls provided their "what we learned today" segments, frequently including sexually explicit or offensive jokes and comments about people's behavior and appearances. The show ended with more jokes, including another about Earl and the hosts’ "O&A virus."

[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The cards pick up.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, B.  There's no reason I need you.  The cards had her.  The cards hit you.  Did they?  Oh, B.  Of course, you had cards fall off her sleeve.  Come on.  No.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, B. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, B.  Now, clean it up.  Are you happy now, Hopey?  Are you happy?  I am mortified.  Oh, Eric, she spilled my chips.  I'm not mortified.  I knew you'd do stuff like this.  She spilled my chips.  Oh, God.  You guinea brat, now clean it up. 
[00:05:30]  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  I am still laughing a day later.  I'm sorry, but I am.  Welcome to the O.P.  and Anthony Show.  It's the O.N.A.  virus spreading across America.  That was a bit much.  If you turned on your XM radio overnight, you really missed an unbelievable show yesterday.  It kind of felt like old times around here, around the new joint.  You being a psychopath.  You know what?  I guess over the weekend, we play all the shows from the week. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  So you're going to have to try to find that show.  I don't know when they're going to play Thursday's show over the weekend, but, man, just unbelievable  stuff.  Yeah, that was cringe radio, is what they call that.  Well, cringe radio is back, Anthony.  We're rebuilding the show slowly but surely.  And, yeah, there you have it.  Yeah.  You know, this head's...  Oh, God.  Oh, again?  I don't think I'm up as loud as you.  Are you trying to fade me down, Opie?  No, you're way up there.  I am. 
[00:06:30]  This jack...  Oh, whatever.  That jack is jack.  Whatever.  Not supposed to complain.  No one's going to understand out there, and we're not allowed to complain because people  get really pissed off, so I don't know what it's going to take to get...  The complaints go in one bucket, and you're not supposed to open that bucket ever again.  Try that button?  Will that work?  Is that it?  Is that it?  No, no, it's not him.  It's me.  This is still not working.  Well, now it's working.  Every morning we have to waste time on technical crap, and then if you complain too much... 
[00:07:00]  No, now put it back.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  All right.  If you complain, they get angry.  They get really angry down in Washington, so I think this will work.  Hopefully.  But you can't explain it to listeners because they don't know what's going on.  It's the volume in the headset.  It starts crackling, and then the channel drops out.  Yeah.  Then the whole show drops out in my headphones, so then I don't think I'm in the air, and  then I start stammering worse than I usually stammer, and then it's just really frustrating.  You start talking like this. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, then you start yelling because you don't know if you're on mic.  I can't hear myself.  So, anyway, yeah, Cringe Radio's back.  We had the girl bring the lesbian couch in yesterday, and...  Well, that's going to get a workout today, from what I hear, huh?  Yeah, we're definitely going to have some girls in here.  Yes.  I don't know, but a lot of people complaining that the show's too sexy lately.  Calm the fuck down, man.  We're the professional broadcasters.  Relax.  Opie, I never thought I'd say this, but you're reading too much.  Well, because I like the...  You know...  I don't read.  We're the people's radio show, you know? 
[00:08:00]  The people's radio show.  We really are, and we listen to what the listeners have to say, and we like the feedback, and  we read all your emails.  Unfortunately, we can't really write everyone back anymore, because the emails got out of  control.  And we wouldn't even if we could, but that's not really the point.  At least I got a good excuse, you know?  So, yeah, people are a little nervous, because we're in this new medium, and they think that  we're doing too much sex.  Too much sex.  If you add up the sex breaks that we've done in the first five weeks here at XM Satellite  Radio, it wouldn't even add up to an hour, hour and a half. 
[00:08:30]  Is it discussing too much sex, or having too much actual sex on the show?  What are they saying, Opie?  What's the voice of this program saying?  The word on the street, as far as the O&A show?  Yeah.  They're getting a little nervous, because last Friday we had lesbians in here that just  put on an unbelievable show right in front of us, right?  And then we did Guess What's in My Pants.  They're considering that sex.  Oh, that's sex now?  Not really, man.  They sound like our old GMs and PDs. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  And then...  Guys, you need more balance.  You know, well, someone, you know, emailed me and like, well, this is what we're thinking.  This is what some people think about the show, for those of you listening at home.  I should find that link.  Find that link.  Opie is doing the air typing thing when he's talking about the email.  And then they list all the stuff, and I'm thinking, you know, in between all this,  there's hours and hours of hilarity and stupidity.  And you know what I mean?  Yeah, that's the thing, you know.  And then the couple having sex in Sacramento over the phone to become the sexiest state  in America.  Yeah.  Now, you know what? 
[00:09:30]  We don't know when that's going to happen.  We can have another couple today trying to, you know, take out California, which is now  officially the sexiest state in America.  We can't pick and choose.  It's whenever it happens.  Right.  So calm down with the feedback and sit back and enjoy the show.  It's one of those things that just, like, spontaneously happens.  You can't plan it.  They call up and they do it.  Exactly.  I pay barely and never mind, Opie.  Well, I'm going to start, too.  Because we've got to come in here and do our show. 
[00:10:00]  I'm going to start, you know, just ignoring all that crap.  Yeah.  Because it gets into your head a little bit.  It's like, oh, my God.  Are you hearing the other stuff?  Did you hear John Valby down at the Steinway shop?  I'm going to tear down the message board, Robin.  It's upsetting me to read.  I hear things about a horse-faced girlfriend.  No, you know, they can write whatever they want.  You know, we don't censor our boards whatsoever.  You know, if you want to call us assholes, you can call us assholes.  And they certainly are calling me one after yesterday's show. 
[00:10:30]  You know what I hate about this new studio, though?  There's no way to break stuff.  No, you were trying so hard to put that nice bowl that she gave you down somewhere nice.  The floor is a great place to break things, Opie.  No, but it's a brand-new wood floor.  It's all polished and stuff.  Ooh, wood floor, yeah.  And it's right next to the rug, the shag rug.  The big hairy rug.  No, it's not a big hairy rug.  Whatever your pleasure, it's more of a 5 o'clock shadow rug. 
[00:11:00]  But it's a beautiful wood floor.  The counter, everything is too nice around here.  You used to be able to smash things right on the edge of the console.  Yeah.  And it would fly all over.  And since everything was crap at that other studio, it didn't matter.  Well, I smashed the Regis CD on the side of the counter, and there's some marks on it.  You did.  See, and I feel bad.  Are there marks?  Over here there are, where I shattered the CD a couple weeks ago, so I don't know.  We've only been here a month.  Give it some time.  This place will look like a real shithole after a while.  Believe me.  I know us.  It's beautiful, though, man. 
[00:11:30]  They built it just for us.  State-of-the-art studio.  I can't wait until we have a little more room, if you know what I'm talking about.  Oh, it's going to be so nice.  Oh, the bulldozer's coming soon.  We're already talking about what we're going to do outside.  I swear to God, you know what I want to do?  I want to do the show.  I want to take a nap and then turn this place into an after-hours club.  The way we're talking, I loved our little meeting yesterday about what we want to do  at the outside of the studio.  We could turn this place into an after-hours club with what we have planned.  A stage. 
[00:12:00]  Hey, Steve.  A sunken lounge area.  We're talking like idiots.  You know what, Steve?  You have to take before pictures.  Oh, yeah.  Because the after pictures are going to be unbelievable.  Yeah.  We're getting rid of all the school lighting that's above.  Oh, I want some cool subdued lighting.  Yeah, it's all going to be soft lighting.  We're going to have like a lounge out there with couches and low tables.  Right.  We're going to have the ability to just take the show from here and go out there and just  broadcast from couches, lay around and crap.  I wouldn't be surprised.  We're going to have a TV with our PlayStation 2 and our GTA game. 
[00:12:30]  I see it one day.  One day we come walking in and out of nowhere, sitting down in the chair, P. Diddy and Paris  Hilton just hanging out at our place.  Right?  Sure.  Why not?  Why not?  We've got a doorman outside, have the velvet rope, just like it was Studio 54.  We can't use our drunk down at the counter down there?  He's real good.  You can get right by him.  Can we keep him?  He's an Irish bar doorman.  He'll decide if you're cool enough to come in.  Dude, I hate him.  I hate him again.  Wait, I thought you were his buddy. 
[00:13:00]  Nah.  Hold on.  Just yesterday.  I hate him.  Norton said he hated the guy.  And then Ove goes, no, I kind of dig that guy.  Well, what happened was I lost my security card already.  You lost your card.  And I guess that's a big deal around here.  Does it say Greg Opie Hughes on it?  So now anybody on the street can pick it up and start signing checks?  You saw my picture.  It's the worst picture ever taken.  It looks like I have absolutely no hair and just...  Oh, the white glare?  It's hilarious.  I love my picture.  Yeah, that's real nasty photography.  I love my picture.  But so yesterday I didn't have my security card. 
[00:13:30]  And I told the guy, and he was really cool yesterday.  He goes, no problem.  Just talk to the security office and get another one.  And I'm like, all right.  And he goes, I'll have to beep you in or whatever, scan you in.  Scan you in.  So he has to get up from the desk and scan me in so we can go upstairs, right, in the elevator.  So that was yesterday.  I'm like, yeah, thanks.  And I'm like, oh, man, that guy isn't as bad as I thought.  He's a good egg.  He's nice after all.  Who cares if he's an ex-convict? 
[00:14:00]  Which I hear he is.  I don't know if it's true.  No, that's nice.  So I arrived today, and I'm walking down the long hall, and he just looks like he's just miserable today.  Had a real bad vodka night.  And I'm just like walking toward him going, I just know this is going to be a confrontation.  I just know.  It's going to be ugly.  So I go, hey, I don't have my card again.  The guy loses his mind.  Look, yesterday was one thing, but today, he just loses his mind.  And he started like a raised voice at this? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, he goes, I don't even think I can let you up.  I'm like, I have to go up.  We have a radio show to do.  Well, you can't go up without a card.  And if the cameras, see these cameras?  If these cameras show me scanning you in, I could get in trouble.  Who's watching the cameras?  Him.  I think he's the guy, right?  I could have to fire myself.  Yeah, he's the guy.  I don't think there's anyone else here at that hour.  Jackass.  So I'm like, oh, my God.  I'm like, dude, just freaking scan me in.  I'll take care of this today.  Oh, boy.  And he gets up all pissed off. 
[00:15:00]  He's all angry.  And now it's uncomfortable as he's scanning the thing in the elevator.  And then he let me in.  I'm like, have a nice day.  Now, I know damn well you're not getting a new card today.  No.  So now Monday, you're going to come in.  I'm going to play this out.  You're going to play it out and see where it goes.  Yeah, I'll play it out.  You will get a phone call from me from downstairs on my cell phone.  That you punch the guy.  Nah, I don't punch people.  Unless they deserve it.  You can take the chips over there and throw it in.  Speaking of that video, it's up on foundrymusic.com. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, I didn't see that yet.  And opiananthony.com.  I'm sorry.  It's really funny.  Of course it is.  I've been doing radio with Anthony 10 years.  I've never laughed harder in my life.  And we've had some big laughs on this program.  I was laughing so hard.  I said it on the air that the back of my head started hurting.  Yeah.  Hurting.  And my gut.  You ever laugh so hard, you get, you know, it just hurts.  You've got to tell yourself to stop laughing.  I was trying to tell myself to stop laughing because it hurts so much. 
[00:16:00]  And know what some of the listeners did because of this replay?  I heard the bit four times.  I listened to every replay last night.  They synced up Steve's video with the audio.  So it's almost like they're doing their own little TV show with the video clips.  And they said it's even funnier if you sync up the two at the same time.  Nice.  Yeah.  Did they really?  Yeah, because, well, what they do is, you know, you only have a little clip of the whole action.  So they're listening, they're listening to the whole bit develop, and then they pop the video on at the perfect time.  I mean, it just enhanced their listening experience. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, it was really, really frightening.  We have to go to the phones really fast because I don't think there's a lot of sex on this show.  I just don't.  There's not enough.  Let's say hi to Mike, the trucker.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Hey, y'all rock.  Thank you.  Yo, yeah.  I used to listen to y'all every time I'd go up on the East Coast.  I tuned you in.  I've been listening to y'all for a while, you know.  And I was glad we all come to XM and that whole other language is this? 
[00:17:00]  I think we're getting some foreign language.  It's the language of the Red State.  It's the Red State language?  Yes.  Mike, come on.  Let's go.  What's that?  Come on.  Get some crystal meth in you and let's go.  You're slowing down the program.  Come on.  He was rolling, but I didn't understand what he said.  All right, we've got to blow you off, Mike.  Guys, when we go to the phones, you've got to be ready, man, because we've got a lot to do today.  Mike from Jersey, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  This may be one of those times where you're going to say that the listeners use the F word a little too much. 
[00:17:30]  Just want them to prepare you for that.  If these fucking homos don't want to listen to two chicks dyking out on a console or two people having sex  and a chick girdling down a load of semen, tell them to take themselves over to the East Village  or wherever the fuck they go in Chelsea and suck a dick because that shit is great.  And we make it funny, too, you know?  Yeah, it's perfect.  This show is all about balance.  I mean, you know, just when you think we're talking about politics too much, we throw the lesbians at you.  And just when you think we're being too nice, then you throw the opie at you and I break crap. 
[00:18:00]  I mean, it's a whole balance.  It's a balancing act, this program.  You bring us gifts, we throw the chips at you.  Well, whatever we've got to throw at you.  Well, just don't bring us gifts from a garage sale.  That's all we're asking.  That's all we're asking.  God, that is it.  I didn't even think of that.  They're gifts from a garage sale.  Right.  That's what he brought.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Later.  You know, we respect the feedback, but I think this message board is way off on this one.  Max from Dallas, what's up? 
[00:18:30]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I walked into Best Buy yesterday to get another XM radio for the house.  By the way, I turned on about 10 guys from work.  They all got XMs now listening to you guys.  There we go.  Anyhow, I was just fiddling with it.  They had a display model, and the part on the rebroadcast where you guys had the guy and the girl from California having sex came on.  And I cranked it up really loud, and this old lady, probably about 50 or 60 years old, with her grandkids, was walking by. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, man, she's free.  She was, like, trying to put her hands over the kids' ears and trying to hustle them off.  And the guy from Best Buy comes running over.  Sir, could you please not turn that up so loud?  I was just laughing my ass off.  There's about three or four other guys standing around.  I've got to get me one of those.  That's fucking awesome.  Yeah, that'll help spread the virus right there.  All the guys will gather around, and all the women will flee.  Yeah, thanks, Max.  Exactly. 
[00:19:30]  A couple more, then we'll move on here.  Let's go to Jim in Jersey.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, what's up, all of a sudden?  Good boy.  Looks like they're getting their XM in Jersey, huh?  Yeah.  I was going to say good morning to Jimmy.  I forgot he's on a plane.  Yeah, he'll check in, though.  He's going to be in Sacramento tonight.  Hey, listen.  Hey, these guys think there's too much sex on the show or something like that.  Let them go listen to Howard.  Howard don't believe in sex anymore.  Well, Howard's all about talking about Bush.  He's going to wreck his career, and I'm going to sit back and watch and laugh my ass off. 
[00:20:00]  I agree with you.  And last but not least, when you were playing the retun news yesterday, all I could think  of is special ed.  You guys got to play that going into a commercial today.  Yeah, we could do that.  All right.  Talk to you later, boys.  All right.  Thank you.  And Ralph from Illinois.  What's up, Ralph?  Hey, how much, man?  I just wanted to call and let you know, I saw the clip yesterday about the poker chip  incident.  Yeah.  That was fucking hilarious, man.  That was just fucking great.  He watched the clip, and he loved it.  Yeah.  You got to see the clip.  Because what you see in the clip is, I'm laughing so hard, and I'm covering my face because 
[00:20:30]  I can't look at her.  I look at Anthony.  He's not looking at her.  And then you see Jimmy.  Jimmy looks like he's going to pee.  Yeah, I know.  And then we're all looking at each other, seeing the other two guys laughing, and it's  making everyone laugh that much harder.  I'm telling you, I've never laughed harder.  It hurt.  It hurt so much.  I had to go take Tylenol after the show.  It was so good after two years of being off to be in that situation again. 
[00:21:00]  Sorry, bro.  To be in that horrible situation again where you're cringing.  There hasn't been a good cringe moment in two years.  Dude, you're the instigator, though, man.  I listen to the replay.  You take little, little jabs.  You encourage the whole thing.  I hand over the chips.  You hand over the chips knowing damn well where they're going.  Who are you kidding?  It's like clockwork.  You've been hanging with me for ten years.  It is like clockwork.  What do you think I was going to do with the chips when you handed them to me?  You need the good cop, bad cop. 
[00:21:30]  You need you to come in and work the guy over.  But you listen to the replay, and it makes it sound like you're such an innocent, nice boy  from Long Island.  You know your mom's listening, and you don't want your mom to think you're a dick.  We're all here working for the same goal.  So you work the guy over.  And then you're screaming at her with godfather lines.  But she doesn't know it's godfather lines, so she thinks you're just yelling at her.  Yeah.  But she doesn't pick up on that because she's just crying because of what I did.  But you handed me the chips.  We got to work together. 
[00:22:00]  Let's remember that, people.  I got to come in, give the guy the cigarette, say, it's okay, my partner, you know how he  gets.  He's a little frustrated.  I don't know.  Something happened in his past.  It'll be all right.  Why don't you just give us some of the information, and we'll get you out of here.  And then you come in, put the light on the face, and whack him in the head with a phone  book.  There you go.  That's how it works.  All right.  I just want to make sure people understand that Anthony is not innocent in this game  we play.  It's a team effort.  It sure is.  It's called good cop, bad cop. 
[00:22:30]  Look it up.  But it does take a certain personality to be able to pull off the bad cop.  What?  You can't do stuff like that?  I don't get that.  I am incapable.  Really?  I cannot do that to another human being.  Not to their face.  Behind your back, I'll screw you like anybody.  But right to someone's face like that?  Oh, it's brutal.  I wasn't that brave, because after I did it, I could not look at her.  You couldn't look at her.  And I was laughing so hard.  Anyway, Toolbag from New Orleans.  It's kind of like a show update right here, because there's a lot of things we need updates 
[00:23:00]  on.  What happened to the pictures of the Sacramento couple, Steve?  Oh, we are patiently waiting for those two to send in their release forms and copies  of their IDs.  And I talked to them last night, actually several times, and they promised up and down that  they would send these things to me, and I still haven't gotten them yet.  Uh-oh.  I like your shirt today.  Things go better with Satan.  Thank you.  Well, that's good.  Isn't it?  With the Coke logo.  What?  Yesterday's shirt, what did it say yesterday?  It was a big smiley face, and underneath, like the Heaven I Stay smiley face, and underneath 
[00:23:30]  in big white letters it says, I hate you.  Opie, Steve and I were walking down 57th Street to go get lunch after the show, and some  woman was so mortified by Steve's shirt, she gave you the dirtiest look.  I didn't see it.  I have to think a word for it.  But you've got to figure, people aren't going to have the same humor as you.  I know that.  So things go better with Satan, with your tattoos and everything.  You walk down the street, and people are just horrified.  You know what?  I'm going for a reaction.  That's exactly why you wear shirts like this.  You're getting one.  Exactly.  You are getting one. 
[00:24:00]  Exactly.  You wear stuff like this, you can elicit that kind of reaction from people.  All right, Anthony.  Speaking of the Sacramento couple, listen to this email I got from BJ.  I wrote most of this on Whackbag today.  Thought I'd send it to you so you could enjoy my misery.  Wow, that just effing sucked.  I've been sick all day, laying in bed.  I decided to just put on the 6 p.m. replay because I was just feeling a tad better and  could actually listen without my head wanting to explode.  Well, I'm laying in my bed just now, listening to the show through my blah, blah, whoa, blah, 
[00:24:30]  blah, some website, I guess.  I guess another person getting the show illegally.  Oh, my God.  You guys are going to be the downfall to the Opie and Anthony show.  We need some of you to subscribe.  Someone's got to sign up.  Yeah, figure this out, man.  If you get the show for free, this show will go away.  We've got to start kicking ass like Lars.  No.  We've got to get out there, man.  That's not our style.  What are you doing?  You're stealing the show.  That's not our style.  Well, and we set up such a system that I don't even know how to break it down anymore.  There's no way.  It was a system we put in place because we knew we were going to get put. 
[00:25:00]  It was a system we put in place, and now we don't know what to do with it because we  don't know where it is anymore.  We created a monster.  We really did because we knew we were going to get fired at our old gig, and we wanted  to kind of spread the virus with our old material, so we encouraged people to get all  the material up on the internet and spread it around the world.  So bootleg it, grab it, put it up on the sites all over the world, on all kinds of servers,  and people were downloading it for two years.  Right.  And listening to the shows streaming on certain websites, you could listen to full shows being 
[00:25:30]  streamed.  To this day, you can listen to our old show every day.  It's just a loop somewhere.  Didn't stop.  So this system is in place, and it worked fine when we were off the air for two years,  but I'm getting email from people going, dude, you have no idea how big this syndication  underground is with the new show.  And I'm like, guys, come on.  Now it's being bootlegged from here.  I mean, people are signing up like crazy to this show.  XM is very, very happy.  Yeah.  But I'm thinking the numbers could be even higher if just a few of you guys would open 
[00:26:00]  up your damn wallets and pay for something.  No.  No, no, no, no.  There's always that element, Opie, that we'll just get it for free.  But I don't even know how to, I don't even know where to go anymore.  I don't either.  It is so hidden.  Isn't that weird?  We create something, and then it just gets so big and so spread out over the internet  that there's no way to stop it.  Well, stupid me, the Infinity Lawyers for a while were on to us and on to the fact that  all our material was out there, and they were trying to shut this stuff down. 
[00:26:30]  So I gave all these guys a heads up that they had to go deeper and deeper.  Now they're in bunkers I don't even know, man.  Yeah, you can't even find the streams.  On servers that are not even in the United States anymore.  And you can't even put Opie and Anthony into a search on some of these sites.  They're hidden.  You need to go to websites and get a password.  It's a word of mouth thing.  You have to bring in a friend.  Yeah.  It's like a speakeasy.  It's unbelievable.  So anyway, I guess this is another guy listening illegally. 
[00:27:00]  And he was listening to the couple effing last night in his room.  You know, he was sick, okay?  So I'm laying there with a massive boner thinking how effing hot this was.  The guy goes to bang the chick from behind, and my mom effing bursts through my door wanting  to show me some allergic reaction bumps she has on her back and tits.  What the hell's going on in this house?  So great.  Wait, I'm lying there on my bed with a boner with a chick getting banged through my speakers,  and my mom insists on sitting next to me on my bed trying to show me these effing bumps  on her tits.  Ah!  Saying it might be measles. 
[00:27:30]  Ah!  Leave.  Needless to say, it made the slight bright spot in my day into complete shit and made  me totally uncomfortable and angry.  Although it was funny that she didn't even notice at all the moaning coming from my speakers.  Now I'm going to have to wait until the weekend to listen to the couple eff.  Ugg.  BJ.  P.S.  The last hour of today's show, meaning yesterday, had me in pain and tears from a migraine I 
[00:28:00]  got from laughing so effing hard.  Yeah.  So, you don't want to, you want to tell your mom to go to a doctor.  That's all.  How do you sit there and diagnose a problem with your mom's tits?  I don't even want to acknowledge mom tits.  No, I don't even want to acknowledge that my mom's a girl.  Just done.  I don't even want to think of her as a girl.  They aren't women.  Your mothers aren't women.  No, they're mothers.  They're just your mom.  And any kind of problem they're having with any area that is considered a sexual area, 
[00:28:30]  why would she bring it to her son?  There's some weirdness going on there.  Ugh.  And he was whacking it.  Oh, that's even worse.  You ever get caught whacking?  Nope.  Never.  And believe me.  Ben, you're laughing.  Like a monkey, I would go at it.  When I was a kid, forget about it.  Any time, any place. 
[00:29:00]  Like a monkey.  Multiple times a day.  If I was home sick from school, I'd just spend the whole day jacking.  I was like a maniac.  I was addicted to my hand.  Wasn't that the greatest day ever when you figured out what you could do to yourself?  Oh, just fantastic.  It was the greatest day ever.  Just fantastic.  You know, it all starts with climbing up the ropes in gym class and go, whoa, what's going 
[00:29:30]  on down there?  I thought this was just something I used to take a leak.  No, it was like, for me it was just looking through porno magazines that you'd find.  You know, as a kid, you'd find them all over the place.  In the woods.  No, I know.  In your dad's closet.  But you have to go back further than that.  I mean, the day when you realize, wow.  You mean, wow.  I could, and wow.  Yeah, but once you put your hand down there, then it's all over.  You know, you could get a boner when you're a kid and not know anything, not know what 
[00:30:00]  to do with it or anything.  But then once you realize that you could do something with it, and then once that first  time, actually, it kind of scared me a little bit, because I really wasn't sure what the  hell was happening.  You're just going at it, and you know something feels good, and you keep going because it  feels good, and then all of a sudden, kaboom, you're like, what the hell is happening?  You get hit in the eye.  What the hell was that?  Like, I thought just the act of doing it without completion was doing it, because I didn't really 
[00:30:30]  have a grasp.  Well, I had a good grasp on it.  So did you think you, but I didn't, did you think you broke it?  Yeah, I thought I broke it.  I thought something exploded.  It was like, it feels good, and then it started feeling better and better and better and better,  and the faster you go, it's feeling really great, and then all of a sudden, kaboom, and  you're like, holy gee, what the hell was that?  You're like, I think I just broke it.  Yeah.  Because you think it's just supposed to keep continuing.  Yeah.  So I got done, right?  And then I went for a little walk in the woods to ponder it. 
[00:31:00]  Like a rape victim?  Yeah, like a rape victim.  It was.  Was this after or before your shower?  You had to scrub off the filth.  No, because it was in the shower.  Oh, really?  So I was able to take care of that.  All right.  And then, yeah, I went for a little stroll in the woods.  I don't even know how old I was.  I could have been 10 or 11 or something.  I don't even know.  A little stroll in the woods, and then I'm like pondering the whole thing.  And then I figured I'd jack it again behind a tree.  That was how long it took me to do it again. 
[00:31:30]  It was like 10 minutes.  And to your relief, you realize, okay, it's not broken.  All right, this is pretty good.  It's not broken.  I will do this now multiple times in my life for every day of my life.  I guarantee that was the day you blew off playing sports and picked up the hobby of winning.  That was it.  Find some porno mags and build a tree fort.  And just, I mean, the trees that I built the tree fort in just looked like white sap was running from it for many years. 
[00:32:00]  You hand over the soccer ball back to Dad.  Hey, Dad, I'm not going to be using this anymore.  I'm not going to be needing this.  I'm not going to be needing my school books.  I'm not going to be needing anything.  Dad, you could sleep in on Sundays from now on.  I really, I'm just not into this soccer thing anymore.  I found something I'm much more interested in.  And that's what it was.  Right.  It was just that I was addicted.  Dad, here's my Little League mitt.  Maybe you could give it to, you know, Johnny, my younger brother.  Because I won't be using this anymore.  And that just continued for years and years and years and years. 
[00:32:30]  That's funny.  Just jacking.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  What do we have going on today?  Where's that one sheet?  I know we got the lesbian couch we're going to break in.  I know we got Pablo Francisco coming in today.  That could be either a disaster or very funny radio.  Oh, he's coming in?  Yeah.  I thought it was a phoner.  No, he's coming in.  And so is old, dirty, Mr. Reliable.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Let's see if he comes in.  Maybe an appearance by Earl.  Ah.  That's always exciting.  Also, got an email from a listener.  She's very concerned because she heard Ozzy on her phone trashing Sharon. 
[00:33:00]  Oh.  We'll read the email in a few minutes here, okay?  Maybe after break.  Very concerned because she thought Ozzy and Sharon were happily married, Anthony.  So we'll get into that, okay?  As we go to break, because we have a lot of new listeners since last Friday, I think it  would be a very good idea to play that John Valby thing again.  John Valby was in a week ago today.  Yeah.  And he forgot his piano.  How do you forget your piano when that's what you do?  I don't know.  And he was still drunk from his appearance in Jersey. 
[00:33:30]  That's the beauty of doing this morning thing.  You get some of these guys really, really drunk and hungover.  And still hammered.  Sleep deprived.  So he didn't have a piano and he started singing a cappello.  And it was just, it was his worst appearance ever on the Opie and Anthony show.  But he turned it around and made it one of the best things we've ever done on the radio  show.  Yeah.  Because we're in this building on the fifth floor on 57th Street and downstairs is the  Steinway Showroom.  This is the snob building we're in.  Right.  Well, is the building called the Steinway Building? 
[00:34:00]  It's actually called the Economist Building.  Oh, okay.  The Economist Building.  And downstairs is the Steinway Showroom with the state-of-the-art pianos, beautiful showroom.  Everyone in there is very elegantly dressed.  They're like in tuxedos walking around in there.  Yeah.  You know.  Champagne, sir.  Would you like to see something in a piano?  And they have this piano in the middle and there's glass windows overlooking the street  and the lobby of this building and, you know, people go in there and buy pianos for, I don't  know, $100,000, some ridiculous amount of money. 
[00:34:30]  It's a glassy joint.  So we sent Sex Bagel down there with John Valby and asked him if we could use their piano  because we wanted John to sing a couple of our songs.  Yeah.  A couple of his songs, I guess.  So we started off with some Mozart and they were really digging him.  I'm like, wow, this guy's really good.  Because he's very talented.  He's an unbelievable pianist.  So he did that and then he breaks into his dirty crap and it's just unbelievable.  So we want to play that again as we go to break and we'll continue.  Hey, could someone else call?  I want to get like some stereo action down there. 
[00:35:00]  Okay.  Let me get one of the interns off the street.  Oh, there might be.  All right.  Never mind, Eric.  Yeah.  All right.  So what's going on down there?  First of all, set this up for us.  Okay.  We're in the middle of the Steinway showcase.  They gave him the big grand piano right here in the middle.  Do they know who he is?  No idea.  But they were just tuning the piano and then removed everything.  So John sat down and he's tickling the ivory.  That's John playing right now?  Yeah.  Let's listen to what he's playing.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Plays very well.  Yeah.  He's just warming up.  He's ready to go when you want him to.  All right.  Oh, my God.  How many people are in the Steinway facility there?  Right now it's John, myself, Bob Kelly's here.  All right.  And just the Steinway piano techs.  How many Steinway people are there?  One, two, three.  All right.  Three people that will be horrified in a matter of moments.  Yeah.  The manager of the place is just standing there with his hands on his hips giving me this dirty  look.  Why?  Why? 
[00:36:00]  I don't know.  He's just standing there.  The techs are explaining to him and he's looking at his watch.  Are they all...  I think we need to hurry and get this done and get out of here.  You better make this quick, man.  Are they pleased with his playing?  The what?  Are they pleased with the way he plays?  The tech said he does very good.  They just haven't heard his lyrics yet.  All right.  You know what's strange?  Valby looks like he's homeless.  He's drunk.  And I didn't want to say it in front of him, but he smells really bad today.  Like booze.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I noticed that, right?  Of course.  Let's have him play a song.  What song should we have him play?  Well, Eric. 
[00:36:30]  Yes.  Have him really...  Because I don't think he knows he's on the air.  Have him jam one of his, you know, legit things.  Okay.  They might toss him soon, man.  First song you do, do something really legit just to...  Just for as a quick warm-up.  Make sure he doesn't go too long.  Okay.  This is going to be great when Eric gets kicked out, because he will. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, of course.  This is where it's going to get really uncomfortable.  I was out on a date in my daddy's car.  I picked her up in a Manhattan bar.  I finger-fucked her clit.  She didn't let out of me.  I had my cock in her throat.  I was humping her face.  My pecker started to spit. 
[00:37:30]  The doctor said the bitch had an epileptic fit.  There, oh, where can my pecker be?  The bitch bit in right off of me.  Here I stand with two balls and a stump.  The bitch bit in my pecker when you take your next dog.  Gotcha.  Oh, that's great. 
[00:38:00]  And there you have it.  The text is saying, we need to leave now.  One more.  One more.  Can you do one more quick?  Just one more?  One more?  One quick one?  Can you just do one quick one?  Like a 30-second one?  30 seconds.  Okay.  Yeah, don't allow him to do one more.  All right.  All right.  One more.  Okay.  Here we go.  Live from the Steinway facility.  Blow chops and hand chops and eating clitoris.  Watching your grandmother douche with laboris. 
[00:38:30]  Brown pubic cunt hairs and toilet bowl rings.  These are a few of my favorite things.  Popping bum blisters in the balls of my ass fat.  Taking a shit in my New York Yankees hat.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Oh, that was great.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  I think he's done.  They're ganging up on us now.  They're clicking us out the door.  Okay, we're leaving. 
[00:39:00]  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  You guys have no idea how crazy that was.  That is the classiest place downstairs.  It is like a social club's lounge area.  Okay, we're coming up right now.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, Eric.  No problem.  You guys have no idea.  This is one of the classiest joints in all of Manhattan.  It's a real piano place.  Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Steinways all over the place. 
[00:39:30]  I would love to have seen their faces.  It's a showroom of just beautiful Steinways, and he's in the middle singing that crap.  It's a landmark building in Manhattan, so that's a pretty special thing.  It's a historic landmark.  It's a historic landmark.  That is...  I would have loved to have seen their faces when he broke into that first tune.  God, was that funny, too.  Jesus.  See how much better it is with the piano?  Even over the phone.  Oh, my God.  Very good.  Wow.  You horrified me.  They're saying we have to leave.  They're saying we have to leave.  They're pushing us out right now. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, we'll hear about that one.  Yeah, we will.  We will so hear about that.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  I found out recently that when a wife gets mad, she spells. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, last week she was mad at me.  She said to me, I said, no.  N-O-N-O.  And the night she was mad again.  She said, tonight we're eating out.  O-U-T-O.  I thought to myself, that's progress, you know.  I mean, in one week she went from a two-letter word to a three-letter word.  And whenever we get out, we get stuck, you know.  You know, we look for bargains.  You know those restaurants where you pay so much, you eat all you want? 
[00:41:00]  We got stuck again.  There's a seafood restaurant.  The sign says, seafood.  All you want.  A buck and a quarter.  It was like going fishing, you know.  I mean, for a half hour we ate bait.  Well, I'll tell you, I'm not so fond of seafood restaurants anyway, you know. 
[00:41:30]  I mean, they got no originality.  They all got the same sign.  The fish you eat today slept last night in Chesapeake Bay.  I'll tell you, when I, when I were to fish, I mean, I'm only interested in how it's prepared.  I don't care where the fish slept.  If it slept, who it slept with, it makes no difference to me.  In fact, I think a fish will taste much better if it was bad morally. 
[00:42:00]  That's how I feel about it.  You know, another thing I don't like when you eat out is when they get busy, you got to split a table with someone.  I never get lucky, like a pretty girl or something.  I always get a loser.  The other night I ate out and I got busy.  I had to split a table with a sat down an old man, you know.  Must have been in his 80s.  This guy was old.  I mean, I asked him to pass me the salt and pepper.  He had to make two trips. 
[00:42:30]  Everything I ordered, he told me, was bad for me, you know.  The whole meal, all my heart was, you're young, you're lame, you're young, you're young.  I ordered a baked potato.  He said, you already had your carbohydrates.  Then he got angry when I left over the skin.  He said, all the vitamins and minerals are in the skin.  I said, look, let me alone, will you? 
[00:43:00]  I don't even want a baked potato.  If you weren't here, I would have had French fries.  Well, I'll tell you, one of the restaurants is going to be the most trouble, the real classy ones, you know.  I took my wife out a few weeks ago on a show, a good time.  I took her to a French restaurant over on the east side, you know.  Didn't work out at all.  I mean, these classy restaurants, someone is always looking for you to give something, you know.  As soon as I sat down, a guy came over with a violin. 
[00:43:30]  I mean, I was hungry.  I had to sit there and listen to Musetta's warts.  Then I couldn't figure out who my waiter was.  One guy took my order.  Another guy wheeled it out.  Another guy served it.  And another guy, well, he just kept putting down butter.  No, no, homie, I couldn't relax.  They all kept hanging around watching me.  Every time I looked up, one of them leaped at me.  Yes, sir.  I said, I don't want to.  I don't just look.  What do you want from me, huh? 
[00:44:00]  And on the way out, they were all waiting for me and smiling, you know.  The guy who wheeled it out was smiling.  The guy who served it was smiling.  The guy with the butter was smiling.  And Musetta's waltz was there, too.  Him, I wanted to walk right by him.  I mean, I didn't ask for no violin.  My wife said it isn't right.  She got to give him something, you know.  So I booked him at a bar mitzvah. 
[00:44:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's fucking stupid.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning to you. 
[00:45:00]  We've got to go right to the phones.  Talking about the first time you jacked it, I guess.  Yeah, we were kind of talking about that, weren't we?  I don't know how we got on that subject because of the guy listening to this.  The Sacramento couple yesterday.  Right, right.  Okay, gotcha.  Let's say hi to Fred.  Hey, Fred, where are you calling from, man?  I'm calling from Augusta, Georgia right now.  Okay.  You got a story for us?  Yes, sir.  I can remember.  I'm 50 years old.  I'll give you that to a bit.  I remember the days when we were with my mom.  We had our Simpson Sears catalog, and that's where you're jerking off to. 
[00:45:30]  So I remember the first time I got it.  All right, slow down, slow down, slow down.  What?  Oh, what catalog?  A Simpson Sears catalog.  Come on, I'm from Canada, so that's a Sears catalog.  A Sears catalog that you would jacket to.  Yeah, I used to jacket to the pictures of the girls in bras.  In the bras?  Yeah, that was porno back then when you were like, I don't know, 10.  Kind of was.  You'd have to look through the circulars and find...  Oh, yeah, you'd get that, or the before and after.  Bikini ads?  The before and after pictures in the back of some of those teen magazines.  Really?  That my older sister had, where you put this cream on your... 
[00:46:00]  The jacket to the fat chicks on the before?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's even better, actually.  I mean, that would be a funny story, too.  But they used to have in the back of these magazines a breast cream.  Oh, right.  Remember the breast cream?  Yes.  Where supposedly the teenage girls were supposed to put this cream on their boobs.  And their boobs would get bigger.  And they'd show the before and after picture, and then you would...  Ridiculous.  You would buy this product as a teenage girl, not knowing that it's actually puberty that's  making them bigger, and that would be a stupid cream. 
[00:46:30]  All right, so the Sears catalog, you used the jacket to that?  Yeah, that gives you that type of idea.  I remember when I was 12 years old, I was in grade 8, and I wanted to get laid so bad because  I was jerking off, and I didn't want to know how I felt like.  So I finally found this girl in grade 8 who wanted to do it with me.  And so she was like a wooden floor.  So that was great.  Of course she had a wooden floor.  Nothing was happening down there yet.  That's right.  So I thought all I had to do was stick it between her legs, and I'd be having sex with her. 
[00:47:00]  So we got on the floor in her bedroom, and then I stuck it between her legs.  I remember it was too dry.  You know, and I thought, well, I just had to stick it between her legs.  I told her to squeeze her legs tighter so I could get it in there, and it wouldn't go  in, so I had to go down and spit in there, right?  Oh, my God.  Only in Georgia.  Jesus.  No surprise here.  Wait.  Were you having sex with her, or were you having sex with her legs? 
[00:47:30]  No, I was having sex with her.  Oh, okay.  The point was, I didn't know what I was doing.  I thought I just had to stick it between her legs, but not in her hole.  You see?  Yeah.  So all I did was I spit in the hole, and it got nice and greasy then.  Then I got in there, and I fucked her.  All right.  Jesus.  Then our parents came home.  Then I found out years later that it wasn't sex at all.  I had to screw it between her legs.  I didn't put it in the hole at all.  All right.  Thank you, Fred.  You scare me. 
[00:48:00]  That is a frightening man.  All right.  There goes Fred.  You are frightening.  We could salvage that call, though.  There are things when you're a kid that you think is sex.  Misconceptions about sex that you do have.  So to that guy, I think he wasn't sure you were supposed to, as he said, put it in the...  I'm not even going to say it.  I mean, come on.  Let's keep it a little clean on this show.  It sounded so nice and innocent the way he told the story, didn't it?  Ah, fuck!  Right.  I think what he was trying to say back then, he thought having sex was just when you... 
[00:48:30]  Oh, no.  He didn't know, but he ended up having sex with her legs.  Opie, I have no idea what that guy was talking about.  I'm really trying to save that phone call.  Somehow he had sex with the girl's legs and didn't actually do it, but he thought he was  doing it.  But I don't know if he knew what actually doing it was.  He wasn't very clear.  He was laughing too hard at his memories.  Right.  Well, I talked about this in the past.  I thought...  Yeah.  I thought you had to do it in the back door and that the other one... 
[00:49:00]  The front one was just used for what...  You know.  And when did you figure it out the real way?  Last week?  Pretty much, yeah.  All the girlfriends were like, ow!  No, it was after the film, obviously.  Like, oh!  Oh, it goes in the front.  That's used for two things.  Well, you're not too clear on the female parts because you don't have them.  Right.  So you're not sure.  Right.  You have the back, so you kind of know what that's about, so you assume... 
[00:49:30]  You know what?  I think we're going to just do a sex show today, I decided.  Is it completely a sex show?  Because you guys try to tell us what you want to hear on this program.  Now we're going to just do sex all day long.  Sexual discussion, and then we have sex on the couch with the girls.  Didn't you have something similar?  What you thought was sex when you were a lot younger?  Yeah, I thought it was back door when I was a kid.  I guess I was about maybe seven, and I thought it was back door.  And then when I learned that it was front door...  All right, so you thought it was back door as well? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  All right, I'm not alone.  You're not sure of the anatomy.  So you don't even know that there's anything different up there in a girl.  Well, when you're really young and you see the front one...  Yeah.  It's intimidating and quite scary.  Very intimidating indeed.  And when you and I were growing up, women weren't really taking care of that area.  No, no.  It was a big, jungly mess.  So you couldn't even imagine that was the way to go.  Yeah.  You know?  You just couldn't imagine. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, no.  It was very frightening.  It was very frightening.  I was brought into it.  Mom, turn the radio off, okay?  Don't listen.  Because it's embarrassing.  Yeah, because we need Anthony to not have to worry about his mom listening.  It's embarrassing talking about, you know...  My mom, it's hilarious.  I was listening today.  I had to turn you guys off.  I'm like...  Oh, that's what mine says, too.  That's fine.  She called last night.  She's like, yeah, I listen, you know, but there are times I just have to turn it off. 
[00:51:00]  It's like, oh, boy.  You know, whatever.  65-year-old woman is really the demo we're looking for.  So, no, turn it off.  That's what, you know...  Of course you're not going to like some of the stuff we're doing.  Especially when you consider it's me telling the stories.  What didn't she like yesterday?  The poker chips?  No, she actually didn't listen yesterday.  But there have been things that...  Whenever we talk about things like this, she doesn't like to listen, which is good.  Don't listen.  When I was a kid and kind of got hooked up through my father in California, 
[00:51:30]  my father kind of hooked me up with this girl.  He hooked you up with a lot of girls.  On my...  I guess it was my 13th birthday or something like that.  Yeah.  Is this the Buzz story?  Yeah, Buzz.  Old Buzz.  She was a friend of the family.  She was 19 years old.  I guess she had banged everybody that we even knew.  Everybody in the town?  Yeah.  She was like the town whore.  Was she really?  The town whore.  You never said that before.  Yeah, she banged everybody.  Was she just a local chick in the bar?  Banging all my father's horse friends, you know, that would go riding with him and stuff. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, your dad was a cowboy after he left Long Island.  He was a cowboy.  He moved out to Southern California.  I'm going to California and I'm going to be a cowboy, baby.  Bought a bunch of horses.  I went out there, lived out there with him, bought me a horse.  I had the horse, the whole deal, Opie.  I was a Western guy.  I wore cowboy boots and the cowboy hat.  I was a cowboy.  It was pretty funny.  Had a six gun.  Sure. 
[00:52:30]  A real one?  A real one.  Bought it for me for, also, I guess, my 12th birthday.  Got me that.  Got me a rifle.  How long did you live out there?  I thought you were just visiting.  14, 15, maybe three or four years.  Oh, you did three or four years out there.  Yeah, three or four years.  I thought you just used to visit.  My formative years.  Because I know your mom threw you and your brother on the bus one day.  No, that was actually coming home.  I moved out there because I wanted to move out there.  I wanted to hang out with my father and ride horses. 
[00:53:00]  It's a kid's dream to be a cowboy.  My brother got thrown out there by my mother because she didn't want to deal with his pot smoking.  My brother's pot smoking, stealing and lying.  Stealing my mommy's quarters out of the quarter jar to buy joints and lying about it.  So mommy threw him out.  So he went first.  No, I went first.  Okay, and then he joined you.  And then he joined me out there.  Gotcha.  He wasn't really into the whole cowboy thing, so he just smoked pot out there.  He was pretty much doing the same thing, only out there. 
[00:53:30]  But you got into the cowboy lifestyle.  Oh, I was totally into it.  I used to listen to the like,  like stuff you'd hear on Hank's Place.  I love Hank's Place.  I would listen to that.  That was my music.  If you guys haven't checked out Hank's Place yet on XF Satellite Radio,  I forgot what channel it is, but it's definitely worth checking out.  It's like either 10, 11, 12, or 13.  Oh, it's hysterical.  It's way up there.  Yeah.  Hank's Place rocks.  It's scary that people think like this in the country.  Oh, it's amazing.  In the country.  It's Red State Station.  Exactly.  Anyway, go ahead.  I was one of them. 
[00:54:00]  I love that music.  So, yeah, I was a cowboy.  And she was like the town whore, Buzz.  And one night, my father and his girlfriend at the time were going out  and just kind of left Buzz there and kind of were smiling,  like winking or something when they left.  I didn't know what was happening.  And you were 13, 12?  Yeah, I guess I was 13.  Yeah.  And then...  Was this for your birthday?  Yeah.  It was my birthday present.  And then Buzz goes, why don't you go upstairs and take a shower? 
[00:54:30]  I'm like, oh, okay.  Not thinking anything about it.  Well, I was riding my horse today.  I'm a little sweaty.  I had cowboy dirt on me.  Okay.  I had cowboy dirt on me.  So I did, and I get out of the shower,  and I'm ready to walk back downstairs and watch TV with Buzz.  And I hear from the bedroom, aren't you coming in?  Like, and no, it didn't even hit me at that point.  Yeah.  I'm just thinking, hmm. 
[00:55:00]  Now, what's the voice coming from in the bedroom?  She was downstairs.  Now, why would she be, oh.  It finally hits you?  Oh.  Oh.  You're like, this is it.  Oh.  This is it.  Here it comes.  I'm going to put all that jack into good use.  Yeah.  So I heard, did you get an immediate boner?  Oh, yeah.  What are you kidding?  You get that whoosh feeling all over.  Well, that's the blood just rushing.  Here it comes.  Here comes that sex stuff. 
[00:55:30]  And then I kind of peer around the corner,  and I look in the bed,  and this vision is just etched in my head.  It's Buzz.  Is it still a really hot vision for you?  It's one of those nice little memories you have as a kid.  I remember seeing Buzz sitting in my bed.  Yeah.  But she's sitting up with her head and torso against the headboard.  Was she hot?  Be honest.  No, she was hot.  I've heard this story a couple times. 
[00:56:00]  You know what it was?  She wasn't fat at all, but she was a big girl,  like tall and not skinny, but not fat.  And she had huge cans.  How much bigger was she than you?  It must have looked ridiculous.  Oh, okay.  Let's just put it that way.  I've never heard this part of the story,  because you're 12, 13.  I was 13.  13.  Yeah.  You couldn't have weighed more than, what, 110, 120 pounds?  I don't know.  I was a little more than that.  But, you know, it just must have looked ridiculous. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  And she was sitting up in the bed with the blanket, like, in her lap.  It just came up to her lap.  So her huge cans were sitting there, all milky white.  They were huge?  Oh, they were huge.  They were huge.  With nice blue veins.  No.  They were just huge.  You didn't see the blood just pumping?  Boom, boom, translucent.  Pumping to the nipple?  Boom, boom.  Boom, boom.  She was sitting there.  Milky white. 
[00:57:00]  And I looked in, and it was pretty much the first time I ever saw her real live.  You know, I've seen a lot of porno.  Yeah.  I had seen a lot of porno at that point.  And they sat up nice?  Yeah, because she was 19, you know?  Oh, okay, okay.  She was 19.  She was the older woman to me.  I know.  When you tell the story, I keep thinking, like, she was a 30-year-old woman.  No, no, no.  She was 19, and you were 13.  19.  All right, yeah.  And, yeah, she goes, well, why don't you come in?  I'm like, all right.  You know, I went in, and the rest is my history.  You know, it just happened. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, you want to stop the story right there?  Well, I knew what to do, so there's no real details.  How long did you last?  It wasn't that long.  How long?  Be honest.  I don't know.  A couple pumps?  Honestly, I would tell you, I really don't remember, but I remember kind of getting into  it.  The first time you'd do it, it's, come on.  You know what, though?  You were drunk?  I had jacked it in the shower that I had just taken.  I had.  I had jacked it in the shower.  You were a jacking machine, man. 
[00:58:00]  A monkey!  I was like a monkey.  I swear to you.  A monkey.  So, did you just do regular sex?  Yeah, but the point is, and how this got brought up with the intimidation factor of the vag  when you first see it.  It's quite scary the first time you see it.  And, dude, this was...  And there's a lot of parts down there.  You're like, wow, what does all that do?  Oh, my God.  I'm going to need a chart.  Right.  Give me a map.  You know, we had continued to have sex for months afterwards, you know?  Like, I was going to... 
[00:58:30]  She would show up at the house after my father and his girlfriend would leave in the mornings  before school.  So, I'm getting ready to go to school, and she would pop into my bed.  And we'd have sex, and off I'd go to school.  Now, what's messed up?  If it was a 19-year-old guy and a 13-year-old girl...  Yeah, I did get in trouble for that.  What?  Kidding.  Oh, okay.  You know, people wouldn't think that's cool.  Like, a guy hearing that, you know, hearing you tell the story that you're 13 banging 
[00:59:00]  a 19-year-old, that is a really cool story.  Uh-huh.  Every guy dreamt that that could happen to them when they were growing up.  I told people at school, and they didn't believe me.  They thought I was just another one of their friends lying to them.  They're like, get out of here.  I'm like, no, really?  I just had sex.  Were you the first one to have sex?  Smell my finger.  Were you the first one to have sex?  Yeah, yeah.  And you're a group of friends?  Oh, yeah.  Must have.  That's, like, really young.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  But now, one of these sexual encounters before school, you know, she goes down on me.  And it was just, you know, wee-hoo, boy. 
[00:59:30]  This is goody-goody.  More fun than toys.  And then she goes, would you like to do this to me?  Oh, no.  And, dude, I am talking.  She wasn't that old.  Crank this up, baby.  Oh, she wasn't that old.  19.  Still a teen in the name.  Still a teen.  Not a nasty Mrs. Robinson. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, like I'm banging Dean Warmer's wife.  With those pointy tits in her bra.  This music's playing in your head.  Oh, no.  As he pulls down her huge panties.  Yeah, he pulls down her huge.  She did have big 70s panties.  Like, you know the ones that just are not cut at all of the legs?  Yeah.  Just big bloomers.  Those were the ones.  Let me step out of my bloomers. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  And it had to be a mess because this was like the 70s, right?  Kick the, yeah.  Late 70s, maybe?  Kicks the bloomers over the lamp and the whole room goes dark.  Or big bloomers.  So she goes, would you like to do this to me?  Would you like to do this to me?  And the only vision I had was the vision I saw of it before I, you know, put it in.  So I remembered what it looked like very vividly.  What did it look like?  Come on.  Dude, it was as if you had punched Fidel Castro in the mouth and his lips swelled up. 
[01:01:00]  And knocked out all his teeth.  Yeah.  That's what it looked like.  It looked like Albert Einstein with a head wound.  It was awful.  Big.  And there was a couple shots of Novocaine in the lips.  Yeah, yeah.  Like he was going for dentistry.  And the hair was spread out so far, like past the area.  She had like leg hair on that. 
[01:01:30]  It was giant.  Thank God you just don't see that these days.  You just don't.  You know?  You don't, thank God.  Because it used to grow, I don't know, man.  Maybe we were brought up as cavemen in some other era.  Because it used to grow like halfway down their thighs.  Down the thigh.  Like, does it even grow like that anymore?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Girls are less hairy, more gooder now.  But know what the problem is?  All these styles come back.  That style will come back.  You think?  Before our time is done on this earth.  I don't think so.  We are going to have to deal with that again. 
[01:02:00]  I'm telling you.  I don't think so.  I'm telling you.  That's like the Hitler mustache.  Not down there, but the Hitler mustache on your face.  I never see that coming back again.  I'm telling you, man.  It's going to come back.  All right, so.  She sat on the edge of the bed one time, naked.  And when she was sitting and her lap, you know, her leg, she was bent at the waist because  she's sitting.  It looked like she was wearing black furry panties.  Her pubes were just so stretched out.  I can't imagine girls were getting a lot of oral back then. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, I know.  I can't imagine because now today, you know, most of the girls are completely shaved.  But just think of the hairy mess when they did.  Big Burt Reynolds mustache and pork chop sideburns going down on a chick with a rug in her lap.  Just a big hairy mess all around.  Oh, cavemen.  Yeah, that went on for years.  So did you do it?  Until I left back to.  No.  I went.  How did you get out of it?  She goes, would you mind doing this to me?  And I just went, I don't think so. 
[01:03:00]  I did.  I said, I don't think so.  She knew I was a rookie.  So then what happened?  I'm not ready for the big league.  So what happened then?  You just continued having regular sex.  Yeah.  You know, she didn't cut me off from it.  That's great, man.  I guess she understood.  You're going to eighth grade getting banged every morning.  That's amazing.  It was odd.  You know, it was pretty odd.  Amazing, man.  And then girls my own age, I was like, you know, jeez, this chick don't know shit. 
[01:03:30]  She doesn't even have.  Can you help a brother out?  She doesn't even have boobs yet.  I'm like, hey, would you mind doing this to me?  And they go, I don't think so.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Wow, that's funny, man.  Yeah.  Hank's Place is Channel 13.  Good.  Channel 13.  Let me see if Ozzy could, that's a great story, by the way, Anthony.  More details.  It was greater to live, Opie.  More details.  And then the next day, I got in the truck with my dad, he was driving me to school, and 
[01:04:00]  he kind of just looks over and goes, so, how was last night?  That's a cool dad, man.  For my 13th birthday, I got a 10-speed bike.  Wouldn't it be fun to know what you know now?  You got a hooker.  You basically got a hooker.  Well, it wasn't a money thing.  Did your dad bang her, too?  Probably.  Who knows?  Probably compare notes.  Yeah, dad.  Nice snatch.  It was, yeah, now it kind of threw me. 
[01:04:30]  Yes.  How was last night?  Oh, if you knew what you know now, like what I could have come back with, it's like, so,  how was last night?  And go, oh, dad, I don't like girls.  You know.  You know, thanks for the effort and stuff, and I really don't like girls.  Yeah.  Man, that's.  Freak them out.  Yeah, that's unbelievable.  Yeah, I was like, wow, no, it was, you know, it was cool.  It was good.  You had the coolest dad in school.  Right.  Let me see if Ozzy could hold on through the break.  Ozzy.  Hi, guys.  How are you guys?  Very good, Ozzy. 
[01:05:00]  How are you doing?  We have a bunch of listeners very concerned about you and your relationship with your wife.  Can you hold on for a few minutes?  Sure, man.  We'll go right to you, I promise, in like three or four minutes.  That's fine, you know.  All right, I'm sorry we woke you up this morning.  I have nothing to do, man.  You know that.  Well, it's 4 a.m. in California.  Yeah, he sounds a little groggy.  Hold on, Ozzy.  Oh, that's just the way he sounds.  Yeah, we got a very tired Ozzy on the phone.  Somebody wanted to hear Special Ed going into break.  Do we have that queued up, possibly? 
[01:05:30]  Because of the retard stuff we were talking about yesterday.  How's your news?  Handicapped.  You got it?  All right, let's delete challenge.  We'll play this, and we'll be back.  I'll do this one.  When I was a boy of ten  I had a very special friend  Ed was kind, with good intents  But just a little different  Oh, special Ed 
[01:06:00]  His mama dropped him, dropped him on his head  Now he's not so bright instead  He's a little bit special  Just a little bit special  We'd play tag  And he'd play a tag  And he'd get hurt  I'd play soldier  He'd eat dirt  I like math  And the spelling bee 
[01:06:30]  Ed like talking to a tree  Oh, special Ed  His mama mama dropped him, dropped him on his head  Now she keeps him in the shed  Cause he's a little bit special  Just a little bit special  I ran track  I ran track  Hung out in malls 
[01:07:00]  Ed ran headfirst in two walls  I had girly girls and lots of clothes  Ed had names for all his toes  Like Larry and Terry and Jerry and Barry and Ronnie and Bobby and Ricky and Mike  And if I love the girl, who cares who you like?  Yeah, special Ed  His mama mama dropped him, dropped him on his head  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread 
[01:07:30]  Cause he's a little bit better  Just a little bit better  I thought college life was great  Ed could count from one to two  I like people and the party scene  Ed was scared of the vacuum cleaner  Special Ed 
[01:08:00]  His mama mama dropped him, dropped him on his head  Now his favorite color is the radio  Cause he's a little bit better  Just a little bit  One day talking to special Ed  He grabbed a brick and he swung in my head  And as he laughed at me  That's when I knew  That special Ed just made me special too 
[01:08:30]  My shoes hurt  Now I laugh as I count bugs  I give strangers great big hugs  Next to me  It is fine  Yeah, he's a fucking Einstein  Oh, special Ed in me 
[01:09:00]  Now we're not right  In the head, you see  Now we're not so, not so bright  Instead  We're a little bit special  Just a little bit special  That fuck red made me special  Just a little bit  Just a little bit special 
[01:09:30]  Opie and Anthony  Oh, oh yes  Oh, that's rocking Friday  Work the tanks  Oh, Mr. Rogers is about to come in your fist hole  My parents never taught me anything about sex  I remember when I had my first wet dream  And it was a real legitimate wet dream  No masturbating 
[01:10:00]  I didn't even know what masturbating was yet  And I was like 12 years old  And my mom used to make my bed  And do my laundry  And I remember I was getting ready for school  And she calls me into the room  And goes, Robert  Is there something you need to tell me today?  Yeah  Don't sit over there  Because that's still a little damp to the touch  And my mother goes  You know what happened?  You had a nocturnal emission  A what? 
[01:10:30]  A nocturnal emission, you know  And I said, no  What are you with the space program?  I'll tell you the first time  I heard about masturbating  It was from my friend Alan  I was 13 years old  I was at this kid's house  And out of nowhere  He admits to me  That he jacks off in his socks  Oh yeah, look  Girls are going  And the guys are like  Yeah  So  Sorry girls 
[01:11:00]  We can't fuck a carrot  So  He says he fucks his socks  And I'm thinking  I'm very open-minded  I really am  But you know  How do you get in the mood  To fuck your sock? 
[01:11:30]  I mean, what are you on?  The bus on the way home from school  Going, hey  Wait till I get you in bed later  You're gonna get it good  You Argyle, you  Take it down to the heel  You sweat sock  And you don't know me  But, you know  I'm very particular  When it comes to sex  And I ain't fucking a sock  I just took off my foot  So that means  I gotta go to the dresser 
[01:12:00]  To pick out  A clean sock to fuck  Forget it  It's just too complicated  Because you don't know me  I'll be standing there going  Hmm  Do I wanna fuck something dressy  Or something casual?  You know  Do I gotta wear a tie  If I'm fucking the dress sock?  Or  And then after you're done  You gotta throw the sock  In the dirty clothes  And, you know  And that's when it dawned on me  You know  When I was 13  That the washer and dryer 
[01:12:30]  Never eats your socks  I've got a friend that said  Oh God  You know  It's the dryer  It must be eating my socks  He's like  No  You only fucked one sock  That's why  There's only one sock  In the dryer  It's  The other sock  Is in the dresser  Waiting to get fucked  XM News  Talk  Sports  And information  It's everything  All the time 
[01:13:00]  XM 202  Opie and Anthony  I saw them in the hall once  They looked like they had small packages  This is the best show ever  The Opie and Anthony show  All the blood  Ha ha ha ha  All the blood  Here, check it out 
[01:13:30]  The Opie and Anthony show  Opie  Yes  Anthony  Pat from New Jersey  asking me if my oral experience with Buzz was like Sigourney Weaver in Alien  coming face-to-face with that second set of drooling teeth.  That was pretty much the image I had in my head, and that's why I was quite fearful.  Her name wasn't Buzz because she was shaving. 
[01:14:00]  No.  No.  And Andy from England.  This show is all over the world.  I don't know what is going on, but a lot of people are listening to this show for free, Anthony.  Andy.  Andy's checking in from London, England.  Maybe we were grown up as cavemen in another era.  What the F does that mean, Opie?  Ease off the NyQuil and learn to speak.  Syndication in England.  Andy.  You know what I was talking about?  He's got to analyze every word.  We're thinking on the fly here.  People know I have a problem with my language lately. 
[01:14:30]  I don't know why.  I think it's because we're getting up at three in the morning.  Sorry, Andy.  Are we bastardizing the Queen's English over there, are we?  Are we?  Yes.  You're critiquing me?  Listen to some of the listeners when I call in.  I'm very articulate compared to them.  Meh.  When I'm feeling bad about my language, I go to a call from Georgia.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, go to one of those trucker calls, man.  Oof.  You want to critique me?  My God.  Get someone from Alabama. 
[01:15:00]  You're a regular Olivier.  I look like an English professor.  I don't know what it is.  My brain's a little fried.  All right, let's get to this email from Melanie.  Melanie, very concerned, Anthony.  Very concerned.  Very, very concerned.  She loves the show, she writes.  Too much sex?  No.  Oh, okay.  She listens every day.  Just one quick question regarding Ozzy on the show.  Heard him talking shit about Sharon, but on TV they look like they're very happy.  Like a very happy couple.  Yeah.  Did something happen between the two of them? 
[01:15:30]  Did she go and cheat on him or something?  Just curious to know what's up to have caused him to say that stuff about her on your show.  Ozzy's been calling our show for years, by the way.  I wonder if it's the fact that she's doing other things, not maybe spending enough time with him.  Well, we're going to find out in a few minutes here.  Yeah.  It is possible that I am the only one in the world that doesn't keep up with celebrities enough to know.  I apologize if this is a stupid question, but I'd really like to know what's up.  Thanks so much for your time.  Keep up the good work, making me and the rest of America laugh. 
[01:16:00]  Thanks, Melanie.  So she's very concerned about Ozzy.  Well, there's only one person that can settle this.  And if I knew how to get there.  No, here we go.  Okay.  Ozzy!  Hi, guys.  How are you guys?  Very good.  Sorry to wake you up at this hour, Ozzy.  By the way, before we get down to the story, I stumble over my words to OB.  Don't worry about it, you know. 
[01:16:30]  See, he's helping you out there, Ozzy.  Thank you.  Another guy that makes me look like an English professor.  I tried to bail you out there, and you went all silent on me anyway.  No, it was good.  It was good.  What?  It was good, Ozzy.  It was good.  Now, what's the deal with you and Sharon?  Actually, Sharon, about a few months ago, she actually came out public and said that while 
[01:17:00]  we were on tour, this is going back years ago, that she had a fling with Randy Rhodes.  And it's absolutely true, but, I mean, I thought I'd be able to move on from it, you know.  But I was fucking heartbroken, you know.  That's quite a few years ago, though, Ozzy.  Yeah, Ozzy, you've got to get over that one.  And, you know, it's been a while, but, you know, I have a lot of time to think about 
[01:17:30]  things, and, you know, it's been eating me up inside, you know.  And now that you're getting older, you just can't get over the fact that she banged Randy?  Oh.  Did she actually bang Randy?  Yeah, man.  I'm telling you the God's honest truth.  You know, she had sex with Randy Rhodes.  Oh, well, you were having sex with some of the groupies out there on the road, right?  No, absolutely not. 
[01:18:00]  That's the point I wanted to make.  On a nightly basis, I've had, you know, the opportunity to, you know, to fuck as many  women as I want, you know.  I never did it, you know.  Right.  Wow.  That is kind of a drag, but.  So what's going on with you and Sharon?  Oh, well, nothing's decided yet, but there has been talk of, you know, separation, but 
[01:18:30]  I'm not sure what's going on yet.  Are you going to move out or what?  I don't know, you know.  Uh-oh.  Was she just listening on the other line?  I heard somebody hang up.  No, I just switched the phone.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you want to go talk somewhere that's a little quieter?  A little bit of the other wing of the house, you know.  Actually, I'm still at home, you know, so I don't want, you know, I don't want to stir  this shit any more than it is, you know. 
[01:19:00]  Right.  Well, I mean, the TV show is dying, or is it dead?  I don't even know.  Are they still running the Aussie show on MTV?  I don't even know.  I think at this point, you know, it's reruns.  I was totally against, you know, the second season to begin with, you know.  But she forced you to do it, right?  Sure, you know.  Because it's all about her, right, Aussie?  I'm sorry.  It does seem to be all about her.  It seems to be all about her.  It's all about my kids and her. 
[01:19:30]  You hardly see me, you know, which is fine, you know.  She's using your fame and popularity to make herself famous.  Sure, she's actually been doing it for years, but I can't complain too much, you know.  She made me a rich man, you know.  But, I mean, I think there's a couple drawbacks to getting this divorce, you know.  First of all, my kids, you know. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  But the other thing, and maybe somebody on this show could relate, I really don't want  to have my shit gone, you know.  Yeah, it's going to be, you know, half your shit and probably more considering she really  had a lot to do with where you are, or at least it looks that way.  You know, you watch the show, you wouldn't have anything if it wasn't for Sharon.  That's pretty much the way she presents it.  So, Aussie, are you giving us a world exclusive here and telling us that you're going to divorce  Sharon Osbourne?  Oh, absolutely, man. 
[01:20:30]  I'm seriously considering it.  And the only reason I'm talking to you guys, you know, I've been listening, you know, ever  since two years ago on an alleged, you know, hookup I had in L.A. before you guys were  even syndicated.  So, I figure I'd go right to, you know, the people who have been talking to me from the  beginning, you know.  You know she's going to kick your ass if you divorce her, right? 
[01:21:00]  Sure, man.  I'm, you know, I'm fucking heartbroken.  Aussie, you've got to get a lawyer first, though.  Don't let her make the first move or you're really going to get screwed.  Do you know any?  And you've got to be petrified because, you know, you can't take Sharon.  She's going to beat the crap out of you.  Oh, no, I'm, if it comes to us making statements in court, I'm fucked, you know.  Yeah.  But I'm really, like I said, there's a couple reasons I'm not moving forward at this time, 
[01:21:30]  you know.  All right, well, let's get to the meat of the issue here.  Why are you getting a divorce from Sharon?  I just, first of all, it's been bothering me for years, like I was saying before.  I've been faithful, you know.  I've had ample opportunity to, you know, go outside my marriage, but I've never done it,  you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Is she screwing around on you? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, man.  I just said that before.  No, I know the Randy Rhoads, but I mean, anything recent?  Oh, not that I know of, but, you know, I'm like a big kid, you know.  Stuff like that really bothers me, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  You know, if you're unhappy, leave the fucking marriage, you know.  That's fine.  But I'm definitely against, you know, going outside marriage, I think. 
[01:22:30]  Ozzy, you're just not into her when she gets naked anymore, huh?  I mean, she lost all that weight.  There's got to be a lot of hanging skin.  Jeez.  Going back to what you guys were talking about earlier, about, what was her name, Anthony?  Buzz.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm really, you had it good compared to what I'm going through.  You should see, you know, a 50-year-old intimate area, you know. 
[01:23:00]  So you're saying Sharon doesn't shave down there?  Not even that, you know, she doesn't, first of all.  But what I was really saying is you thought there were a lot of, you know, crevices and  whatever.  Oh, God.  You should see one that's had time to age.  Jack's big head going through there probably made some damage.  I don't need to know about Sharon's poo-ha.  You just want some young poo-ha, right?  Well, at this point, it's looking like a better alternative, you know. 
[01:23:30]  Is there anyone out there that you're interested in banging?  I have to tell you, some of the friends that Kelly brings around the house, you know.  I knew it.  Some of them.  I mean, I might as well, of course, stay over 18, you know.  Yeah.  Wink, wink.  But I think that if I had another chance, I'd go for somebody a lot younger, you know.  Yeah, of course.  All right.  So, all right. 
[01:24:00]  It looks like Ozzy's going to get divorced, Anthony.  That's what it's looking like.  That's what we're finding out today on our program.  Well, we wish you the best, Oz.  But, you know, whatever makes you happy, Ozzy.  When was the last time you had sex with Sharon?  Oh, it's been probably about a month, you know.  Oh, that's not too bad.  It's not too bad, but, I mean, I can't, you know, this is new information for me, you know.  You know, I only found out about it recently, so it's kind of affecting my sex drive with her, at least, you know. 
[01:24:30]  So, I figure if I move on, I get my, you know, because I don't have too much time left, you know.  Wait, what's the new information?  Well, that she was having sex with Randy Rhoads.  I only found out about it, you know, a few months ago.  Oh, and that's the reason?  You're that pissed off about something that happened, like, 30 years ago?  Absolutely. 
[01:25:00]  Well, I hope it.  What makes it, what says she's, you know, doing it as we speak, if she's doing it, you know.  Well, I don't think she's doing Randy as you speak there, Ozzy.  But she was unfaithful back then.  Maybe she is now.  Unless she's got a shovel.  I would hope not.  Right.  I believe, but I'm just, you know, I'm, like I said, I'm emotionally, I'm a big kid, you know. 
[01:25:30]  I don't think you're thinking straight.  I mean, if this happened 30 years ago, I think you could get over that.  Oh, you know, I guess some people deal with things different ways, you know.  And it's possible that I might get over it, but I just don't know.  I think this is a tip of the iceberg issue, Opie.  I think, you know, it's probably been building for a while, and this is just something else that's gotten under Ozzy's skin.  I mean, another issue, I mean, let's be honest, I genuinely love my friends, you know.  But I have to say, I've been wanting to get out of it and retire for years now. 
[01:26:00]  Right.  So what are you going to do, like just move to England and let her stay in the States?  Yeah, I haven't decided yet.  I haven't even decided if I'm leaving yet, but if I do leave, I'd like to stay in, you know, in the States.  But, you know, Long Island's a nice place, and California's a nice place.  I'm just not sure what I'm going to do yet, you know. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  All right, Ozzy.  Well, you know, keep us informed, okay?  All right, we'll do, guys.  Like I said, you know, I love you guys' shows, so if anything else happens, I'll, you know, be happy to let you know.  All right.  All right, Ozzy.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, Ozzy.  All right, you guys take care of yourself.  All right.  Bye.  Paul from Boston.  Hell hath no fury like an Ozzy scorned.  Wow. 
[01:27:00]  There you go.  There's a world exclusive.  Ozzy's getting a divorce, Anthony.  A little dejected.  All right, we're going to step aside and continue.  What?  Oh, I know.  It's unbelievable.  Why is Access Hollywood calling?  They're calling already?  Here, let's go to break here, and we'll continue.  It's time to find America.  Let's hear it from California.  This guy's a champ, man. 
[01:27:30]  Lucky girl.  Oh, God.  I need a towel.  Yeah.  I need a towel. 
[01:28:00]  Come on.  There are plenty of other booths, too.  Thumbs up.  Stop.  Jesus Christ, Jim.  Think you can do better?  Call O.P. and Anthony live at 866-WOW-1-WOW and give it your best shot.  How big does that thing get?  You know what's weird about New York?  And I was, this is my little story of my life.  I was born in New York, and I grew up in Florida, Hollywood, Florida, which is a very beautiful  place, but it's very different.  And I used to talk like this when I was a little kid, because I'm from Brooklyn.  You know, I used to talk like this. 
[01:28:30]  My mother made the best fucking spaghetti in the fucking neighborhood, and that's how we talk.  And I moved to Florida, and the kids used to make fun of my accent, and they're like,  hey, kids, say something.  Hey, what do you want me to say?  And they go, ah!  So you become aware of your accent.  So it's not really a stick.  But the weird thing about the New York accent, there's no logical way the New York accent could  have been conceived.  No logical way.  First people in America were who?  Now the States were who?  Danish.  Danish, right?  Well, you have a different textbook than we did.  Because it was an Indian thing.  I don't know.  Maybe you're missing chapter one, or your abstinence that day. 
[01:29:00]  We forget the Indians.  But I know what you meant, Jim.  And you're right, in a sense, if you just wipe off the Indians like we did many, many  years ago, you know, that's an easy way to figure that out.  But the good thing is that you're ready with the answer right away.  You had 10 or 20 seconds before the buzzer was going to sound, but you were, Danish!  You know what I mean?  Unless you were ordering from the bar, and I didn't, you know.  You know what I mean?  It was like, Danish!  And I was like, oh, shit, the timing was impeccable, you know?  But anyway, so the first people in America were Indians, and their accent's nothing like 
[01:29:30]  New York.  And the first people to settle in the United States, in New York, were British people, and  their accent's nothing like New York.  The Dutch, well, the Dutch, the Dutch didn't stay long.  They went all the way down to Bowling Green.  They couldn't find parking.  They fucked off and went home.  That's what happened with the Danish.  It's really true.  But the British actually were the settlers, and they, and, but no matter what, there's  no logical way the accent could have been conceived, because even if it was Indians and Danish,  how did Kemosabe, and like, all right, turn into Opioids Joe, you know what I mean? 
[01:30:00]  Right?  There's no natural progression anywhere, unless Christopher Columbus spoke that way.  You know, it's like, hey, who's sailing the frickin' Nina?  Jesus, that boat's going up and down all over the ocean over there.  Guy's a freak.  Look at him.  He's going up and down.  He's drunk, like Delaware, you know?  Heather.

We're going to be bringing in Pablo Francisco in a little while. 
[01:32:30]  And it's Tainted Blood, if you remember the old show.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's right.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Also, we got some girls from nyconfidential.com coming in.  Ooh.  We got the lesbian couch.  We want to break that in a little later on the program.  Yes, we do. 
[01:33:00]  Does it still stink a little bit?  Yeah.  Are we smelling a little mildew-y, a little old couch-y?  We need to get some Febreze.  We need Febreze.  And just in case you're here in the show for the first time, where the hell you been?  We put a blacklight over the couch yesterday, and we found only one splooge stain.  So that's good.  After the girls are on it, we ought to check it with the blacklight again.  Oh, we definitely will.  We'll see what's going on.  Brand new stains.  Definitely will do that.  Your brother wants in on the conversation.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:33:30]  About you and Buzz when you were a kid, Anthony.  Oh, let's see.  Out there in California.  Let's see what Joe's going to add.  Brother Joe, Anthony's brother, of course.  Joey!  Joe!  Yo!  Hey, what's up, man?  You're on the air.  Yeah.  What the hell happened?  What's up?  What the hell's wrong with you?  Nothing, man.  I was just getting gas.  I'm on my way back from Atlantic City.  Oh, you're getting gas?  Okay.  Yeah, I'm coming back from Atlantic City.  I just saw Tom Jones.  Oh, how was that? 
[01:34:00]  It was cool, man.  Did he do dry vagina?  A bunch of old ladies, though.  It was hysterical, man.  They're like throwing these big old bloomers up at him.  Do they still throw their underwear at that guy?  No, it's hysterical, man.  Oh, I love Joe.  Joe, you have a great life now, man.  You don't have to get up early to do those.  Oh, Joe just cruises around the world.  He's just doing his band thing and going to see Tom Jones concerts.  See Tom Jones, because he can now.  How does Tom Jones sound, Joe?  Things are good. 
[01:34:30]  You guys have made it that way for me.  Thank you very much.  What's Tom Jones sound like?  Any good?  Dry.  Was that a Tom Jones song originally?  Yeah.  The guy sounded incredible.  Yeah, he was really good, man.  Still has his pipes.  Great show.  Hasn't lost a thing.  Wow, very cool.  Hasn't lost a thing.  I've got to go check him out.  It's pretty fun.  Well, anyway, I'm calling to talk about Buzz for a second.  Yes.  Anthony tends to whitewash things just a little bit.  What did I whitewash?  Oh, my God.  She didn't sound like a beauty.  Nothing about...  No, no, no.  Everything is good as far as your detail goes, except for one thing. 
[01:35:00]  Buzz looked like a Cro-Magnon.  She had...  All right.  ...a distended brow.  She had a unibrow.  Oh, my God.  Well, that's a detail that you forgot to tell us, Anthony.  I wasn't looking at her face.  I was horrified at the vag.  What was hairier?  Her vag or her head?  It looked the same.  Her face, I would say.  She had a univag and a unibrow.  Wow.  You were talking about the hair thing.  I mean, that was directly due to the fact that she was like a Neanderthal. 
[01:35:30]  Hey, at least I wasn't 15 banging that 30-year-old mother with a friggin' axe crotch.  Wait a second, dude.  She was 32.  Wait, are we going to get a new story today?  Oh, there was one time I was with Buzz in one of these bedrooms in this house.  Joe's the older brother.  Go ahead.  And Joe was slamming this 32-year-old mom.  While you were banging Buzz?  Yeah, in the same room.  And Joe goes, hey, at midnight, let's switch.  And I said, I go, there is no way I'm banging that old broad. 
[01:36:00]  All right, hold on.  She walked like she'd been riding a horse for about 18 years.  That girl, what was her name?  Do you remember?  Sue.  Sue.  This girl, Sue, a woman, Sue, her legs were so spread apart, and she had the gap, like where  her vag was supposed to be, was a gap like a hatchet wound.  Was that from riding horses?  I don't know what it was from.  Or doing horses.  Maybe getting slammed by everything that walked. 
[01:36:30]  But, dude, she had to accommodate me, so it worked.  All right, wait a minute.  Oh, sure.  Hold on.  Let's slow down, guys.  Slow down.  So, I got to get the visual here.  Yeah.  You're 13, Anthony.  You're banging Buzz.  Yeah.  While Dad's out doing his thing.  Uh-huh.  And Joe's in the bed.  I think I was probably 14 at this time.  All right.  And Joe's in the bed next to you, banging a 32-year-old?  No, a different room.  Oh, no, no.  He was in a different room.  It was a hallway, and then two rooms at the end of each hallway.  Did you hear each other going at it?  I don't think so.  There was Peter Frampton was playing.  They always used to put the Frampton Comes Alive album on. 
[01:37:00]  Come on.  I swear.  Sue would always put the Frampton Comes Alive album on blasting.  And all we heard was, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Don't you feel like we do?  That wasn't Frampton.  That was actually you going down on fuzz.  The old man hooked me up with her as well.  I mean, the old man did a lot for us that way.  Oh, there it is.  There's some Frampton.  Is this bringing back memories, boys?  Oh, it's bringing back such memories.  Jesus. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, I think the old man was banging Sue also.  Probably.  Yeah.  All right, wait.  So Joe was a little older.  So you were only 15 or 16 banging the 32-year-old?  Yeah, I was about 16, I guess.  Yeah, and he was banging the 32-year-old and wanted to switch at midnight.  What, you guys had a little conference in the hallway?  Yeah, yeah.  In between banging?  We saw Sue breaking out the Frampton album.  We knew we were getting laid.  Real tag team.  Yeah, so Joe wanted to do the switch.  And, man, I had, believe it or not, buzz with the unibrow, the big 70s Earth Mama muff, 
[01:38:00]  the big Amazon woman, was bad enough.  But this is telling how bad Sue was.  I wanted no part of her.  There was nothing about Sue that was turning me on.  She was much too old.  She was thin.  She was thin.  She was small.  She was emaciated.  She had flapjack tits.  She had two kids who were in the other room.  She had two kids in the other room. 
[01:38:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  In the other room?  Yeah, there was another room that the kids were in.  This was a flop house.  Oh, it was ridiculous.  I swear to God, man, I would have gone through five Sue's before I would have taken one buzz.  You wanted buzz.  You were the one that recommended the switch, that suggested the switch at midnight.  Dude, that was because I was 15, and I figured, what the fuck?  We were just scrolling around.  It would be fun, something to do.  Switch it up a little bit.  Horrifying.  What were the kids doing while you were banging their mother?  They were probably playing with Legos.  Who the hell knows?  Who the hell knows? 
[01:39:00]  Did they call you Daddy, Joe?  The girl walking in one time on me.  Oh, great.  The little girl walking in on us one time.  She was like seven.  I know.  She was only about maybe six years younger than me, right?  Did we find any of these people?  Who knows?  I don't know what the hell is going on in California.  Sue's probably got the eights.  Which hippie call me should we check?  You guys are a bunch of hippies out there.  Yeah, hippies.  Tom Jones last night.  Who knows?  Probably.  She's old. 
[01:39:30]  Old broad.  Joe, you had a great father, man.  Yeah, I'm telling you.  He liked to party, that's for sure.  He gave you guys poo-ha, man.  I remember, yeah.  Guns, alcohol, and the bitches.  He hooked us up.  Guns, horses, booze, bitches.  My dad gave me a good jump shot.  There you go.  That's what I got from my dad, a good jump shot.  I used to come.  And really good ball handling skills, and you guys are getting poo-ha, man.  I used to come home from school.  I went to Marco Forster Junior High School, and it was right by the stable where we kept 
[01:40:00]  the horses.  So I would get done with school about three o'clock, walk back to the stable.  And every day, my father, who for some reason couldn't hold a job, was sitting in a chair  with Chato, the Mexican guy that had a horse at the same ranch.  And they would just sit there drinking what they called the Yambos.  They were the big 40-ounce beers.  Why don't we get another Yombo, Yoey?  And then they'd sit there just drinking beer.  And when their wives or girlfriends would bitch at them, they would look at each other 
[01:40:30]  and go, ah, I'm going to get me another one.  And this was their life, riding horses, drinking, and screwing girls like Buzz and Sue.  Yeah.  So he was getting us right in line to do that, drinking beer, riding horses, and screwing  women.  Making homebrew.  And making the homebrew.  They used to get these casks from these whiskey factories, big wooden barrels, and they would  take them back to the ranch, fill them up with like five gallons of water, and then roll 
[01:41:00]  it.  Every couple of days, you'd roll it, like a quarter roll.  And then after a month, you'd drain it out, and you'd get one gallon of liquid that would  come out.  But it was like pure alcohol that would leach out of the wood from the casks.  And we're kids!  And they're giving us shots of this stuff.  We were fucked up.  I mean, completely hammered.  What a great way to be raised.  Dude, you drank a glass. 
[01:41:30]  You had it on the rocks.  Yep.  And stood up from a...  That's how I drank at 13.  On the rocks.  On the rocks.  Go ahead, Joe.  Joey.  Yo.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  And you proceeded to go straight down to your knees.  Oh, yeah.  Took a big shot and just went thud.  Passed out.  It was great.  Why straight down to your knees?  Buzz was standing in front of Anthony there?  I wouldn't have gotten on my knees for Buzz, that's for sure.  Looked like tumbleweed rolled in our lap.  All right.  You know what? 
[01:42:00]  To wrap this up, you guys got to tell the story of Mom finally calling out to California  and going, boys, it's time to come home.  I think she was a little concerned for your safety.  Oh, that was when we...  Yeah, we had decided it was time to come back east and maybe get civilized for a little  while.  I was just coming back to visit.  Joe, of course, was coming back to live there.  But after I visited with my family here in New York for a while, I really didn't know what  I realized I was kind of programmed in California and they kind of deprogrammed me here in New  York and I decided I better stay because I really was heading on the road to ruin out 
[01:42:30]  there.  But it's funny how you guys got back home.  You had to take a bus trip, right?  Yeah.  Well, my mother had sent out two airline tickets for me and my brother to fly us from California  to New York.  So my father got the tickets, went to the airline, sold the tickets, took the money and bought  us two Greyhound bus tickets and put us on the bus.  And there we were on this two week long excursion.  You can't be pissed at him because he gave you puha, man. 
[01:43:00]  There you go.  I go home with hookers and pimps.  Yeah.  So we were taking a bus all the way from California, L.A. to New York City and it stopped at every  city.  You know, we stopped everywhere.  And the collection of dregs of society, male hookers, hustlers, girl hookers, pimps.  And I'm talking like like huggy bear pimps.  These guys with the fur hats and everything.  It was just a collection.  An ouzo bum who had a bottle of ouzo with him the whole trip that everybody, when he 
[01:43:30]  passed out, would take and pass around the bottle.  And we were drinking this bum's ouzo, this hot chick we met that was getting off in Cheyenne  but decided to hang out with us all the way into New York.  Who knows what happened to her?  Probably murdered or ended up a hooker.  And then we finally get to New York after two weeks on the road.  And right when we step off the bus, we get arrested by NYPD.  This detective comes over.  He came up to me and grabbed me by the shoulder and said, excuse me boys, you have to come 
[01:44:00]  with me, right?  And now you left out the fact that I was smuggling in tie sticks.  Right.  Now the cop goes, come with me, get your bags.  And we're like, oh my God.  Joe's got like pounds of tie sticks.  How old were you, Joe?  Oh God.  Probably 17 now.  I think you were 17.  Okay.  I think about 17, 16, 17.  And he's just like a load of tie stick in his bag.  And the guy goes, we're going to get your bags and we're going to check you out, you 
[01:44:30]  know, because they thought we were runaways.  They thought we were runaways coming into New York to, you know, hustle or something.  So thank God that girl did follow us from Cheyenne and just hang out with us on the bus.  We told her, could you get this one bag and get it immediately before we get there?  And she ran and got the bag and actually didn't steal it and took it.  And then the cop goes to call my mom up.  And I'm like, could you just identify yourself and first say your kids are fine.  I'm NYPD.  And I've just took them and I want to verify that they're not runaways. 
[01:45:00]  He gets on the phone.  Hello, Rosemary.  Yes.  Do you have two sons, Joseph and Anthony?  Yeah.  And you just, my mother's horrified.  This guy just strung it along without like telling her we were okay.  Guy was a real prick.  But we got off the hook.  Remember the knives that the old man gave us?  Yeah.  He like confiscated our knives.  My side and the cop was patting me down.  He goes, oh, what's this? 
[01:45:30]  What's this?  Put his hand over by his gun, takes the knife away from me.  Yeah, what a collar.  Yeah.  What a collar getting the Kumia boys.  Goddamn hysterical.  Well, thank you for the memories, Joe.  I forgot about Sue.  All right.  More stories than that, though.  For another day, all that Mojave Desert.  Shootings and everything.  Yeah, we'll talk about the shooting next time you call in, right?  I saw more shootings than Puffy.  Yeah.  On an entire show, too.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a great story.  But you're going to have to tell it live in the studio, though.  But, Joe, bashing Buzz when you're banging a Sue is a little much. 
[01:46:00]  Come on.  She was this mousy woman with these big glasses.  Remember Sue's big dopey?  She looked like Tweety Bird.  She had these big glasses.  Hi, Joe.  I got my glasses, and I'm going to bang you to Peter Frampton.  Ow, my ass hurts from last night.  Oh, that's funny.  Don't bang my Cro-Magnon, woman.  I don't know, man.  Who would you rather fuck, Tweety Bird or Mike Tyson? 
[01:46:30]  I was screwing Sasquatch.  No shit.  That's great.  All right, brother Joe.  I'm going.  You know where I'm going tonight?  Where?  Where are you tonight, Joe?  I'm going to break time in Maryland, and then I'm going to a place called Ned Devine's in Virginia Saturday,  and then I'll be back on Sunday.  And don't forget the downtown, man, the night before Thanksgiving.  Night before Thanksgiving, yeah.  We're going to do a big party.  Joe's playing there.  What bands you got there that night?  I have the two tributes, the U2 tribute, not U2, and 2U at www.notutube.com, 
[01:47:00]  and Evolution, the Journey tribute at almostjourney.com.  And then me, Joe, and a bunch of the guys.  Yeah, we're going to get up and make buffoons out of ourselves.  We're going to, you know, we're going to get the band back together, man.  Yeah, it's going to be a piss-up.  I think we're broadcasting this live on our channel.  Yeah, why not?  We're going to slap it up on the channel.  The night before Thanksgiving.  Are tickets still available?  Live?  Are tickets still available for the downtown?  Yeah, absolutely.  Over at the downtown box office, or, yeah, call downtown, or go on the website. 
[01:47:30]  Any of the, you can get them anywhere.  Not too many available, though.  They're going.  I mean, uh...  Yeah, it's going to be a good night.  All right.  Cool, man.  I'll talk to you, Joe.  All right, guys.  All right.  In honor of Brother Joe and the fact that he went to see Tom Jones.  Tom Jones, one of his favorites.  I love this little parody he does.  It's called Dry Vagina.  There you go.  Brother Joe.  Dry, dry, dry vagina. 
[01:48:00]  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  So before my penis starts to get sore, come pick up some badsy lube at your local drugstore.  Said go get so bad to do bad  You're a local bus star 
[01:48:30]  Oh, you stink, baby  There you have it, Brother Joe  Not quite the range of Tom Jones, poor Joe  I love the song, though  You know that Greyhound bus thing?  Yeah  I don't know, I started thinking  We should really send someone on a Greyhound bus  All the way across America  It's not fun, man  Half my head, half my head fell asleep  This was a horror  I remember, like, there was nowhere to sleep  You're on a bus, you're in a bus seat  It wasn't like a recliner 
[01:49:00]  You're in a bus seat  With your head against the window, right?  For two weeks  Yeah, it was horrible  So my head was on the back of the seat  And half of the top of my head fell asleep for the entire trip  And then my thumb fell asleep  It was awful  We gotta find someone that has a good personality  That's willing to take two weeks off  We don't know anyone with a good personality  You know what I mean  Someone that could do some good radio for the show  Like the old days  Oh, good radio for the show, forget it  And then we give them a cell phone  And throw them on a bus  And give them a recorder  And see what happens  Between here and L.A. 
[01:49:30]  On a Greyhound bus  Yeah  It would be great radio  But we can't, like, throw Steve on the bus  We need all our guys  We gotta find somebody  Because I think that would be really cool to check in  People would be a little intimidated by Steve, I think  They wouldn't interact with him much  They'd be a little scared of him  You need someone that, yeah, has a personality  Can communicate with all types of people  Right  You know, not wearing a things go better with Satan shirt  A guy that doesn't look like he wants to kill somebody  At all times  He'd scare people off the bus  What's your problem today, Steve?  You seem a little angry 
[01:50:00]  I hear tell  Now, I haven't heard from Steve  So I don't know  But word around the office, Opie  Word around by the water cooler  Don't mess with Steve today  Steve is angry today  Look, we're getting head nods from the booth  Eric, let's get Sex Bagel on the air  Yeah, Steve's got a bit of a  And rightly so  But he's  Of course, say rightly so  You get your ass handed to you  I'm not stupid  All right, if it has anything to do with XM equipment  Then forget it  Then I have to keep my mouth shut  Because  I have to keep my mouth shut about that 
[01:50:30]  All right  We're working hard to resolve the issue  But I'm going to  You're angry at the bucket  That doesn't have the things in it that we need  Thank you  All right  Excellent way to put that  All right  That's it  We don't need to get into it  You know the problems  Just listen to the show last week  Same problems  He's a disco dancer  Oscar Wilde reading  Streisand ticket-holding  Friend of Dorothy  Know what I'm saying?  He's gay  What was that?  Wow  Where did that one come from?  I wanted this  You know what?  The thing  We're putting the show back together 
[01:51:00]  So  That clip kind of actually fit though  Oh, come on now  All right, Ben  What's going on outside the studio?  We got Pablo Francisco  He's playing Carolines this weekend  Here in New York City  And the girls are here  From  New York Confidential  And why Confidential?  But we only have them for a limited time  Why?  They have an appointment at 9.15  At 9.15  Where?  An appointment  At a very lovely hotel  In this area  An appointment  Oh, I thought maybe they had a doctor's appointment  Or an appointment with a broker or something  So they came by our show 
[01:51:30]  Because they're in between clients right now?  Yeah, they're just filling out some paperwork  But they'll be ready to go soon  That's great  That couch is going to be a mess  All right  And what are they going to do today?  Are they going to be all full up when they get here?  Yeah  They're getting off  They got  Well, hey  I don't know what happens at these things  But you got to assume that perhaps  I don't know  There might be a little leakage  Anthony, really?  Yeah  I'm thinking  Before we take another break  Artie from Yonkers  In GTA 5  That's Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas  I played a two-player game 
[01:52:00]  Of pool and a bar  I parachuted out of planes  I'm dancing  I set up the DA with pot  I killed the foreman  By knocking him into a hole  While he was in a port-o-potty  Then I filled the hole in with cement  What a great gag that is  You could do that?  You knock someone in a hole  In their port-o-potty  And fill it up with cement?  I've barely scratched the surface  Yeah, this GTA game  The new one is unbelievable  There's so many side things  You could do in this game  I hear you could wager on the horses 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, Kevin down there in Washington  One of our bosses  Was explaining that  Yeah  There's a  The guy on the air yesterday  Was trying to explain  But we didn't get it  I guess there's like an OTB basically  And he could go in  And actually  You know  The money you have collected  In the game  By beating people  You could bet horses  And he says it's so addicting  That he stayed in this OTB parlor  Whatever it's called in the game  For like hours  Just betting like long shots  Like lots and stuff  Like a real low life  Supposedly it's really, really cool  That's great  And one of the horses' name 
[01:53:00]  Was Reeves Revenge  Reeves Revenge  So  I barely scratched the surface  But I'm so incredibly buff  My character is so intimidating  It's so frightening  That I'm beating people up  And I down him with two punches  Two punches  Boom, boom, gone  I got a problem with my character  What?  He has no sex appeal  And I'm thinking  You gotta go to the hookers  No, I beat the hookers up  I can't help it  That could be one  I can't help it  Every time I say a hooker  Because I'm thinking  They have the money  No, a lot of them don't  I know, they don't really have the money 
[01:53:30]  Some of them have weapons  And they turn the knife  For the people that don't play this game  You know, you beat up people  And kill them  And then you get whatever  They have on them  Yeah  I'm thinking the hookers  Got the, you know  The paper  As they say in the game  The paper  And they don't  Most of the time  So my duck  It's now  So then I was looking at my stats  I'm starting to get a little flabby  And my sex appeal is way down  You haven't been to the gym  No, I haven't  Well, not in the game  I go in real life  In real life  In the game  You gotta go to the gym  I understand  Get all buff  Your character is really buff  Because you've been to the gym 
[01:54:00]  My character now looks like Mike Tyson  When I first  When you first start up the game  Your homies goof on you  Because you're so skinny  You just got out of the joint or something  Right?  And you're all skinny  And they goof on you  Now, I swear to God  I log in  And I don't even recognize my character  He looks like Mike Tyson  I got the big do-rag around his head  And I got  Your character looks like Mike Tyson  Or Buzz  Gold jeans  Looks like Buzz  Jesus  My old lover  Yeah, it looks like Buzz  And then I go around 
[01:54:30]  Beating people up  I go to the white neighborhoods  Up in the Hollywood Hills section  Oh yeah  And I beat up white people  And steal their money  It's great  It's like real life  I love it  I absolutely love it  But I've just scratched the surface  I'm looking forward  The missions are really tough though  Some of the missions are real, real tough  It's not about the missions after a while  Yeah, I know  But I do the missions to unlock  Some of the other territories  Have you discovered the skateboard park yet?  I think I drove into it by accident  Oh no  Get a motorcycle and go into the skateboard park 
[01:55:00]  It's like a pool, right?  An empty swimming pool type of thing  Yeah, they got the half pipes and stuff  Yeah  And if you have a motorcycle  Oh my god  You go straight up with the motorcycle  And it comes straight back down  No, they won't give you that for some reason  But it's pretty wild  I was driving around in some section yesterday  And it had a bunch of car carriers driving around  With the ramps on the car carrier down onto the street  Oh yeah, yeah  So you could zoom up behind  I've done that  Just fly over the top of them  Yeah, that's pretty cool  Yeah, that is really fun

[01:57:30]  Well, I went on the bus trip  I was pretty much  I fell down on my luck in Houston  I went down there with a car  A few-haul trailer full of stuff  And I wanted to come back in a Greyhound  With pretty much nothing  And there was me and this other dude  He was in the same situation I was in  And it was just crazy  But there was this French chick on the bus from France  The whole time he and this dude  Trying to bang this girl  And she kept on telling us  She was married 
[01:58:00]  And she eventually told the bus driver  And the bus driver had to separate us from this girl  See, that's what happens too  If there's a girl on the bus  She becomes like the game  Like everyone's just trying to have sex with the girl on the bus  Yeah  That could be a great reality show, man  From a Greyhound bus  Oh, just put  You know what?

[02:10:00]  It's everything  24-7  XM  202  The O&A Virus  It's everything  All the time  The Opie and Anthony Show  I have huge teeth  Underwear  Then shorts  My vagina  The Opie and Anthony Show  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show 
[02:10:30]  It's the O&A Virus  Spreading across America  Slowly but surely  Hello  We're getting there  We're getting more gooder every day  You're witnessing the greatest comeback in radio history  Oh yeah  In progress as we speak  It's in progress  That's for sure  We used to be on top of the world  And then we were shown the curb two years ago 
[02:11:00]  That's right  And every day the show gets a little better  Man yesterday we added the lesbian couch  To the new Opie and Anthony Show  You're gonna break it in today  I ran into the hall to go to the bathroom  And there's four really, really, really hot pieces of asses  Out in the hallways  All smelling just unbelievable  Really?  Is Steve out there ready with the video camera?  Steve's the best man  No, Steve, I'm just imitating Steve  All right, well  He's got the camera though? 
[02:11:30]  No, he's got it  Well, no, he's got it  Oh, oh, there it is  Damn  They're filling out their paperwork  After they fill out the paperwork  As soon as that's done  They'll come in here  And they smell all nice  What is the form that these people have to fill out?  It takes forever  We have several forms  It's unbelievable  What?  Dude, the paperwork to get into this studio  Has gotten ridiculous  Remember the old days?  Ah, come on in  Oh, I know  Think of yourself, great  Okay, bye  Thanks for coming  Here's a prize  Thank you, goodbye, goodbye  But now it's like  It's a whole booklet of things they got assigned  There's IDs  All kinds of legalities  There's an FBI check going on 
[02:12:00]  With some of these people  Master Poe pats you down  Well, Master Poe  You know  He's our assigned killer  Literally  He was hired to  They told me this  I don't want them getting pissed  But they told me  We hired a guy  That's going to be  A secretary slash killer  Basically  Yeah  So if you guys ever have a problem  This guy who's  An expert at knife fighting  And stick fighting  So don't come in here  With knives or sticks  They'll kick your ass  Somebody was telling me  That they practice moves on each other  There's another guy here  That's a martial arts expert 
[02:12:30]  And they just practice moves  Really?  In between segments of the show  You're the best around  Like Karate Kid  But you know  I know he means well  Master Poe  But he's making me a little paranoid  Why?  We can't even go to the bathroom anymore  By ourselves  He goes  Oh no, no, no, no  Follow me  Then he unlocks the bathroom  Because you have to have a key  That's security in itself  Who the freak's going to be in the bathroom  If you need a key to get in there anyway  So that makes you paranoid?  Then he opens the door  And then he checks all the stalls  And everything  Like okay, clear  Does he kick them in 
[02:13:00]  One at a time?  Boom  Boom  So he checks it all out  And then he goes  Clear  We're going to have to talk to him  Yeah  Because I'm getting a little overly paranoid  Now I'm starting to look at the ceiling tiles and stuff  Wondering if someone's going to pop out of the ceiling  You know  I don't know what's going on  That's why you're paranoid though  You think  Because he's making such a to-do out of it  That there must be somebody  Let's just put it this way  He's really, really good at his job  Extremely good at his job  Every day he's got a camera 
[02:13:30]  He's taking pictures of everything  He's got a sixth sense, Opie  Of danger  He can smell danger  I don't know if he can smell it now  Because the smell of the girls  Now the girls are taking care of all bad smells today  Of course Old Dirty didn't show up  But if Old Dirty shows up  He's got an area of tape  Yeah, he taped  That Old Dirty has to stand in  He taped off an area for Old Dirty  Our old pal  That I agree with  Yeah, I mean he's a really good friend of the show  But he likes to steal our stuff  And then sell it on the street  Yeah  So  The Old Dirty didn't show up today? 
[02:14:00]  Of course not  Okay  Well, we should say hi to Pablo Francisco  And then let me know when the girls are done with their paperwork  Because I know they have a job to go do  Yeah, I hear they have an appointment  Yes  Ladies and gentlemen  Making his return to the Opie and Anthony program  The last time he was on the show  It went horribly wrong  Did it?  Remember?  Tainted blood?  Was there tainted blood?  Remember that?  But here he is  Pablo Francisco  How you doing, man?  Man, this studio's rad, dude 
[02:14:30]  Isn't this cool?  They built this for us  It's like Star Trek  It's Captain's Log  789  782  I cannot believe it  Seems like  Aurora  What's going on?  Seems like we have a big hero  It's crazy  I know, and we're still trying to get stuff to work  It's so futuristic  That there's so many things that kind of go wrong every day  Right, right  That we're not even allowed to talk about  Because they get upset down there  But let it be said  There's a few things that have to be checked every day  Adjusted still, yeah  Adjusted  Yeah, yeah  Nuts and bolts  A lot of nuts  The guy gave me a big old contract 
[02:15:00]  Right  You gotta do that  I know  A little fingerprint  DNA  Retinal scan  I was like, yeah, Riggs  What's the deal with this, Riggs?  Put it in your mind  That's my new one  I'm working on Danny Glover  So I sounded just like him  Yeah, there you go  Yeah  Put it in your mind  That's a mess  Now go downstairs and don't get a cab  Yeah, don't get a cab  Don't get a cab, Riggs  Isn't it weird?  Danny Glover's done movies that many people have enjoyed 
[02:15:30]  But he did that one thing about the cabs  And now all I think about when I see Danny Glover  Is the fact that poor bastard can't get a cab  He still can't get a cab?  Yeah  You complain about the cab, are you serious?  It's like, I'm Danny Glover  Give me a cab  What am I gonna do?  Are you Danny Glover?  Forget it  I got to go  Yeah  Put in the cab  They've taken care of that problem  Have they taken care of the black people?  I guess you're getting a lot of trouble now  If you don't pick up the shwuggies  They get  Opie  Can't be shitting  Yo, man  What's the deal with that, man? 
[02:16:00]  That is not a good term to use  It's a made-up term  What did you say?  Shwuggies?  Shwuggies  Shwuggies  Our old boss used to call the homies shwuggies  Shwuggies  Yeah  I think it's like a Yiddish thing, though  I think it's a Yiddish word  Yeah  I don't know  I don't know what's more obscene  You're saying shwuggies  Or the fact that you're using a Yiddish word  No, but someone wrote me and said  That's not the Yiddish term for black people  It's not?  It's that  Schwatz's  Or whatever it's called  Schwatz's?  Schwatz's  What is it?  I don't know  I think the term is criminal 
[02:16:30]  It's criminal  Well, they pop out at like 12 o'clock  And now you're walking up  Pocus Pocus  What's up, man?  Abracadabra  Okay, man  Can you help me out, man?  I need a dollar, man  Can you help me out?  I was just looking around  And the coast was clear  Pocus Pocus  Abracadabra  Yo, man  Can you give me a dollar?  And they got a phone  Hello?  What's up?  Where did you come from?  That's what happened in Cleveland  When we were walking around  Cleveland?  Oh, jeez, man  They come out everywhere  You notice that too, right? 
[02:17:00]  You can't even leave your hotel anymore  In Cleveland  Downtown Cleveland  You cannot leave your hotel  Unless you don't mind being bothered  You cross the street  What do you know?  There's another one  You cross the street  He pops out of nowhere  What's the deal with that?  I was walking in this morning  And I'm very fearful  On my walk in  Right  Because it's pitch black  Well, Master Poe's ready to walk us to work now, too  It's pitch black outside  And it's very, you know  There's nooks and crannies  In the buildings  That I'm walking next to  And you don't know who's going to jump out 
[02:17:30]  So I'm walking  And all of a sudden  I hear  Like someone behind me  I'm hearing footsteps behind me  And instead of looking  Turning around  I don't know why  Why do I have this feeling  Like I'm going to offend somebody?  Please tell me you started running  No, my eyes try to go around  Like a chameleon  Like I'm trying  I don't want to bend my head too much  Like, don't worry  I trust you  I'm not looking at you  I just want to make sure  You don't have a knife  But I don't want to see  I want to see it out of the peripheral vision  God forbid I get a direct view of you  And you get offended 
[02:18:00]  And think I'm looking at you  Like you were going to stab me  You know who it was?  Yeah  It was Eric  Oh, it was Eric?  Yeah  He was behind me  He goes, hi  He sees me like craning  Trying to look  Not look at him  And he figured he'd put me out of my misery  By saying, hey, Ant  Well, you're driving a homie car these days  And when I was walking to work yesterday  You scared the crap out of me  I take it to the garage, motherfucker  He scared the crap out of me  You can curse, by the way  I saw the look on your face  Like, whoa, what the heck is that?

Martians  Martians  Right, it goes into outer space  Do you know the actual line was  One small step for man  One giant leap for motherfucking mankind  And it's because you're in space  You're allowed  But you drive a homie car now  And yesterday you scared the crap out of me  Because I'm walking to work on 57  Oh, that's true  And all of a sudden  There's just a lot of beeping going on  I beeped and flashed my headlights at open  And I'm thinking  Yeah, and I'm thinking  Is that exactly what they do 
[02:19:00]  Just before they do the drive-by?  Your eyes were locked on the walk  Don't walk side  As he's walking across the street  He would not look at me  No, I was like  Grand Theft Auto  Yeah, Grand Theft Auto  Yeah, real life  That game is getting into my head  So now I'm looking at everything  Like, oh my god  Here comes the drive-by  I had the window down, B  I was like  Yo, Opie  What's up?

[02:19:30]  Pulls up next to me  Exactly  The window rolls down  And some homie goes  Yo, man  That caddy can move  To me  Because I took off from the light  Because he was next to me  So I wanted to get away  Yo, yo  The upholstery in the back  Seen look like a coffin  Hell yeah  Yeah, really  The upholstery  The upholstery in the back  Look at that car  I look like a coffin  What's the deal with that?

[02:26:30]  In radio  When you're doing radio bits  Yeah god forbid  The reason why  That didn't sync up  Nicely for you Pablo  Is because we have to  Put the New York Times  Up over the windows  Okay  Because we're in an office  Filled with  I don't know  Guys  And there's somebody  Out there  I don't know which one  They get offended  And we don't want  Like sexual harassment charges  Brought up against us  So we get this  New York Times every day  And instead of reading it  For knowledge  We use it to  To cover the windows  So someone gets offended  When they see the girls naked

[03:02:30]  Natalia, very cool  The 18 year old that was in high school only four and a half months ago  Very cool  And a Japanese from Australia, from Korea  Who looked like she was scared S-less  She did not want to be in the studio  I don't know  I don't know what to do  So  What are you going to do?  So we're just letting the gang over there know  Uh-huh  Mediocre appearance by your girls today  Yeah  You think they're really taking the jet?

Oh, smack my bitch up  Alright  Oh  Alright, he's trying  He's trying  Is that Scott Weiland? 
[03:03:30]  Huh?  Uh, we gotta get Steve in here  Cause he just handed me something that's quite disturbing  This just in  This George Bush thing  Gets Steve really fast  Uh  He's coming  It's a George Bush remake, Anthony  It is  Yes  One of those things where they edit his speech  I don't know what this one is  Because he's saying the N-word a lot  What?  Is he?  Yeah  President Bush?  Yeah  Newly elected President Bush?  And I don't think there's tape of this guy  Actually saying the N-word  So I'm trying to figure out how they got this together 
[03:04:00]  Steve?  Yeah  What is this thing about?  Yeah  Oh, the, uh  It's Martini Steve, Pablo  Martini Steve  Yo, what's going on?  Steve  God, that's irritating  Of course it is  Part of his program  I know, I know  I want you to have a nervous breakdown in front of us  That was sent to me  That was a link  That was a link that was sent to all of us 
[03:04:30]  Was done by the same guy, Rx  That did those other George Bush remixes  Okay  How did he get Bush saying nigga?  You can take fragments  You can take fragments of speech  I'm like, Jesus  When do I get to leave?  I keep forgetting  Was he saying negotiate and asthma in the same sentence?  You know, who knows?  And he kind of clipped it?  Who knows?  If you zoom in enough and you are meticulous enough  You can take fragments of words  And change it around and make it sound like he said anything  Well, not you because you don't have a studio  I don't know exactly  Well, we're not talking about that, right?  But we're not talking about it 
[03:05:00]  If you get near  If you get near  You get near  And then  Like I'm saying  Right  As far as you can go  Then you put nigger  Exactly  If you're really a studio rat  Which this guy obviously is just listening to this  Of course  You can glue fragments of words together  And make it sound like he said anything  All right  All right, you want to hear this?  A little bit?  Let's give it a try  It's time for somebody to lead  All of America's niggas  And by that I mean  The young, the black, the brown, the women, the poor  All of America's niggas  And by that I mean  If we can put the nigger vote together 
[03:05:30]  We can bring about great change in this country  If we can put the nigger vote together  We can bring about great change in this country  Now I know why the red states voted for this guy  Wow  He's speaking their language, Anthony  I just realized that wasn't edited at all  This was his acceptance speech  Yeah, he's right  Was this on BET?  Yeah  What's up?  Spinning rims, niggas  Amazing  What's he doing?  Into the thick of the fight 
[03:06:00]  I appreciate you listening tonight  I ask for your forgiveness  I ask for your patience  I ask you to uphold the Constitution  And the American Bill of Rights  There are difficult days ahead  And the way forward may sometimes appear chaotic  I will not relent  I will not leave  The contest of will  No one can question the skill  The actions of our enemies over the last few weeks  Have been brutal  Calculating  And instructive  One of his campaign people  He got off track here, I think  He's like a puppet  I think he got a little off track  George Bush won  George Bush lost  I don't see how you can lead this country 
[03:06:30]  If you say war would make this world a more peaceful place  That's kind of a fucked up mentality  What?  Now he's cursing?  Yeah  You can take a full line  From one piece  That's what I thought  This was going downhill  Now he's cursing?  Yeah  Let's listen to that again  It's starting to get hot  It's getting hot  It's kind of a fucked up mentality  Makes no sense  I don't think I make sense  I don't think it's right  It's ludicrous  The troops wonder  How can I follow this guy?  I'm loathe  Good words to somebody else's mouth 
[03:07:00]  It's time for somebody to lead  All of America's niggas  And by that I need  Young to black to brown to win  And poor  We can put the nigga both together  All right  First  Let me just say this as clearly as I can  Stop the killing in Darfur  Stop the killing in Darfur  These crimes are genocide  Stop the war  This week  The return of the sky  This administration had its chance  They have not led  We will  This administration had its moment  And President George W. Bush wandered it 
[03:07:30]  Now is the time  Now is the time  Now is the time  Somebody to lead  All of America's niggas  Everybody went  Oops  That wasn't a popular move  But it's the right move  I disagree  Strongly disagree with that  If we can put the nigga both together  We can bring out great change  In this country  Racial prejudice  Is a reality in America  Pure and simple  Where 200,000 black males  Were denied a right to vote  In the 2000 election  State of Florida  The matter was handled in the courts  And thought by some 
[03:08:00]  To be settled  But the matter was not settled  We have a duty  To defeat this enemy  The best way to protect us  Is to stay on the offense  That is the best way  If we send mixed signals  If you send mixed messages  If you say  We have a duty  You better mean it  Get out the world  So chaos  In a few cities  War has just begun  This vile display  Shows a contempt  For all the bounds  Of civilized behavior  It reveals a fanaticism  That was not caused  By any action of ours  And would not be appeased  By any concession 
[03:08:30]  The wait  The wait  The wait has been long  But it won't be long now  And it won't be long now  And it won't be long now  We believe it is a tragedy of history  That in the United States  Which gave the world great gifts  Of law and science and faith  So many have been held back  By lawless tyranny and fanaticism  We believe that when all Americans  Are finally allowed to live and think  And work and worship  As free men and women  They will reclaim the greatness  Of their own heritage  And when that day comes 
[03:09:00]  The bitterness  And burning hatreds  That feed terrorists  Will fade and die away  America and all the world  Will be safer  When hope  Has returned  To Washington D.C.  If we can put the naked boat together  We can bring about great change  In this country  If we can put the naked boat together  We can bring about great change  In this country  The game is over  Rue the day  I'm taking the person  The man who sits in the Oval Office  The throw  An expert  And a crank  Don't stay out too late  And beyond the violence 
[03:09:30]  Iraqis are proud people  Who resent foreign control  Of their affairs  Just as we would  We can achieve the peace we all want  One heart  One mentor  One person  And one soul  At a time  And let me say one other thing  May God bless our kids  I'm taking hookers  On my plane  I'm taking  I'm taking whores  On Air Force One  That's right  That was pretty cool to listen to  George Bush saying niggers 
[03:10:00]  And motherfucker  I like to fuck young ass  I like to fuck young ass  Wow  I like it from behind  I stick my dick  In high school girls  They pull my pud  They pull my pud  In the White House  Where did a duck come from?  I stick it in the fucking poop chute 
[03:10:30]  That was rambling  With some moments of humor  Yeah  It had its moments  And that was just Pablo  Oh  That's right  The Bush thing was excellent  Let's bring back the escorts  I want to get it done now  I want to stick it in  Here we go  Oh  Oh  Oh  I'm done  We just stink at telling the guests  To leave  We just  We just don't know how to end things

[03:17:30]  A little too fancy for my taste  Type of place  They leave chocolate on your pillow  Before you go to bed  Who started this?  Yeah I think  Four out of five dentists  Recommend a Zagnut bar  Before you hit the sack  I sleep real well  With five pounds of sugar  Running through my bloodstream  Why don't you just leave me  A violet crack  And a pot of black coffee  On the pillow  It's four in the morning  I'm so wound up  I'm counting my pubic hairs  To go back to sleep 
[03:18:00]  And I'm  If you want to make my stay  More pleasant at a hotel  Why don't you start  By removing that jet engine  From the air conditioner  Ever try to sleep  In an air conditioner  In a hotel  With the air conditioner  On high  Say  Wake up the next morning  It's two degrees  In your room  You got Walt Disney  Laying next to you  People actually 
[03:18:30]  Coming into my room  For ice  Some of the machines  Broke down the hall  Let me scrape some  Of your nuts  Okay  A little Italian ice  For the kids  We appreciate that  Well they're playing  Marco Polo  They work up a sweat  And they're very thirsty  Either that  Or you pump that  Dry heat into your room  You wake up the next morning  The inside of your nose  Is like a box of Triscuits  You know  You get that irritating 
[03:19:00]  Whistle in your nose  I'm trying to sleep  I get Zam Fear  Master of the pan flute  Cutting an album  In my sinuses  And you touch your nose  To get rid of it  The pitch gets higher  You're like  Sounds like Mariah Carey  Stepped in a beer trap  What is that  I like bad hotels  Nobody bothers you  The nice hotels  They pamper you too much  You know  This maid comes to my door  Eight o'clock at night  Would you like me to  Turn your bed down for you

[03:20:00]  I'm not sleeping on the  Bathroom floor again  God damn it  It's everything  24-7  XM  202  The O&A virus  It's everything  All the time  Opie and Anthony  Yeah  I fucked em  This is the Opie and Anthony show 
[03:20:30]  Now known as the Opie show  Lost Jimmy  Now he lost Anthony  And now it's back to being  All about me  What do you want to hear  Anthony is taking his first leak 
[03:21:00]  In five weeks  When we go to break  We all run to the bathroom  And take care of business  Anthony just sits in his seat  For five straight hours  But today he decided  That he really needed  To take a leak  I usually read  The instant feedback  And a news site  But I've been drinking  So much club soda  This morning  That I had to take a leak  You just wanted to make sure  That Pablo was gone  No  No  I knew he was gone  You know we acknowledge  When the show's really good  We acknowledge 
[03:21:30]  When the show's really bad  But this show  Is a soap opera  Yes it is  And the bad segments  Have a place  I don't think it was  A bad segment  I think we  It had moments of  Mediocrity  I think we come up  You know  I think we come to the table  When Pablo's on  Try to do our best  You know  He just kind of  Steps on a lot of things  Well yeah  But I'm also thinking  Talking about the  NY Confidential Girls  Oh them  Yeah  They're going to have to  Make up for this 
[03:22:00]  Mediocre appearance  They're going to have to  Step up  And that's what's good  About this show  Because now that'll be  Running a little thread  Of a soap opera  As we move forward  With the Opie and Anthony show  You didn't tell me  Sensei Master Poe  Comes into the bathroom  I told you  I thought he checked it out  That's literally the first time  You've taken a leak  In five weeks  I walked in there  During the show  You had just come out  Of the bathroom  Right  And I walked in  And he still  Cased the joint  Yeah why do you  Case the bathroom  Master Poe  Now didn't you  Case the joint  When Opie was in there 
[03:22:30]  Ah yes  And then you walked out  And then I walked  Right past Opie  And you had to  Case the joint again  It only takes a second  See how secure he is  No he's the real deal  He is the real deal  He's like secret service  Kind of awkward though  Was a little weird  When he walked in the bathroom  With me  I was like  No sometimes he doesn't  Even let you go in the bathroom  He goes wait here  And then he'll give  The all clear  It makes me feel  Kind of like  I don't know  Like we're in Fallujah  Right  It's like we're going  Into a palace bathroom  Well thank you 
[03:23:00]  Is there any security issues  With the bathroom  Well right now  The only problem that we have  Is the door is broken  So anytime you go in there  If you don't close it  Tight enough  It's going to stay open  So when you guys go back  Into the studio  You could have 10 guys  Go in there with baseball bats  We can't have that  Is there a duct  That someone could  Get through  I have a feeling  That you were brought up  In a different neighborhood  Than me  Because I don't even  Think about that stuff  About 10 guys with baseball  Unless I'm playing GTA  Yeah exactly  I think you might have 
[03:23:30]  Had a different upbringing  Possibly  I'm just here to make sure  That everything is  He does his job  Very well  Yes sensei  Thank you  Thank you gentlemen  Alright we have  We have a few stories  In the paper  We've got to get to  Reverend Al Anthony  I love this one  Reverend Al Sharpton  And his wife Kathy  Enjoying themselves  At a National Action Network  Dinner in April of 2001  Nice picture of Reverend Al  And what looks like  I have to say it  A man  Dude  What the hell  Or a transvestite

[03:31:30]  Alright  Also in the news today Anthony  Well Edward's wife has what breast cancer?  Man they held that news back huh?  Yeah that's not much of a  That's one of those things like  Well maybe we shouldn't mention until after the election  Absolutely  That would have swayed voters  There's no joke  He'd have his mind on his wife  Which of course he would  Right  And may not be concentrating on the duties  But I think they knew going into you know election day  Duties 
[03:32:00]  What?  What?  What happened then?  You said what?  Yeah oh they knew  You said on election day?  Yeah  They knew?  Where's the post?  Give me that post over there Steve please  So  The post is the one with the stink fumes coming off of it  Why?  Because  The post  It's not a real newspaper  The New York Post  Alright  And this story is just amazing  Absolutely amazing  The headline  F-16 attacks New Jersey  Just another school shooting Opie 
[03:32:30]  Yeah  Except this was done by an F-16 fighter jet  How cool  How do they mess this one up?  How cool is that?  A pilot shoots up school in training blunder  While the kids are away  While the kids weren't in the school  Alright  A fighter pilot  Cruised by a New Jersey school  Firing 25 rounds from his wing mounted cannon  In what the military is calling an accident  During a night time exercise  That's great  The Wednesday incident over the Little Egg Harbor Township  Intermediate school in southern New Jersey 
[03:33:00]  Which was not occupied at the time  Is still under investigation  Officials said yesterday  It is not clear why the unidentified pilot of the F-16  Fired at the school shortly after 10pm  What is he doing shooting at anything  Over South Jersey?  Apparently there's a gunnery range in Jersey  A gunnery range in Jersey  We're gonna drive to the gunnery range, Wendy  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  The pilot was assigned to the District of Columbia Air National Guard 
[03:33:30]  Based at Andrews Air Force Base  He was on a night time training mission  And was supposed to fire at a target  Oops  At the Warren Grove firing range  About three and a half miles away from school  He was supposed to fire at Asbury Park  Because it would have caused thousands in improvements  Yeah, why don't they just like  Fence off Asbury Park and let them practice over there  Practice over there  Did you know F-16s are flying and firing live ammo into Jersey  And only three and a half miles from a school 
[03:34:00]  If they're doing it right  Were they doing it right?  Because it was three and a half miles away  I'm saying he was supposed to hit these firing  Hit some targets at this firing range  Only three and a half miles from the school  That's still too close  I mean he obviously messed up bad  But messed up big time  The school was closed at the time  And no one was injured  The custodian was the only person in the building  He called cops after hearing what he described  As footsteps on the roof of the building  Those weren't footsteps  No  Turned out to be two inch  Non-explosive lead rounds from  Two inch 
[03:34:30]  Oh my god  Yeah, he was firing rounds at the roof  From one of those Vulcan cannons  This is what's pretty messed up  The pilot was 7,000 feet in the air  When he fired on the community below  7,000 feet up  Three miles away  And these rounds hit the roof of the building  Right  Frightening  Do you know what kind of gun it is?  It's a Vulcan cannon  And I actually have real audio  Of what these things sound like  Yeah  Listen to this  Those are just rounds being fired 
[03:35:00]  Oh, you never want to hear that  You never would hear it  If it was shooting at you  I wasn't sure if that was like  The sounds of the missiles there  No, they're not missiles  What are they?  Bullets  Big bullets  Big bullets  Yeah  It almost sounds like a Jim Norton fart  Doesn't it?  Yeah  I saw some video  Of Iraq  A lot of this stuff's been on the websites 
[03:35:30]  You can find it if you look for it  It's attacks on people in the street  And you see the night vision camera  And you see a crowd of people coming out  And then you hear the audio  Of the guys directing the attack  And it's out of things like  You know, helicopters  F-16s  And they unload on these people  And it's  You know, it's something  It's a snuff film  It's pretty much a snuff film  Because you're watching  About 15, 20 guys  Just getting  Ripped to pieces  And the guy 
[03:36:00]  The guy in the audio  You can hear him go  After it's all done  Dude, they're ravaged in the streets  Yeah  You just see the heat  The heat sensitive  The bodies are laying in the street  Blood all over the place  They've chewed these people apart  And the last thing you hear on the audio  Is the guy goes  Oh, dude  No way  Yeah  Oh, dude  Yeah  Ripped them apart  We got some great stuff  To shoot into schools  Alright  What's going on out there?  I don't know  Anything big?  I see Master Pose out there 
[03:36:30]  Is he ripping someone's arm out of his socket  And beating them over the head with it?  Actually very distracting  What are they doing out there?  Carrying on business  Right in front of the window  In front of Obi's face  That's all you need  A big distraction  What are they doing?  Nothing  There's a bunch of UPS stuff  That's the guy from Belfast  They got the slick hair  That's like  We're not going to take any fucking bullshit  About security  He's the crazy  He's the one that's like  They're putting all that bulletproof glass  What are they trying to secure?  Listen to U2 and drink Guinness all day  Yeah, exactly  That's what they do  Yeah  I love it  Is someone else going to be working out  Of this building?  Like  Dude, do you see the booth 
[03:37:00]  They built in front of here?  It's pretty sick  I think  After our show  This place turns into a bank  And that's where the teller sits  Because it's bulletproof glass  First of all  Bulletproof glass  And they've lined the inside of the wall  With some kind of Kevlar material  Yeah  Like that's a safe  It's a panic room  If someone invades  We run into the panic room  And make fun of them  Through the bulletproof glass  You can't get assholes  You fucking asshole 
[03:37:30]  Shoot me asshole  Try to shoot me  Oh, wait  Wait, let me push you up  Hi, hi  Can you see me through the window, asshole?  Go ahead, shoot me  Shoot me, dick  Nothing  You ain't got nothing  Oh, you're bouncing off, idiot  Good  Once you run out of ammo  Master Poe's gonna shove that Uzi up your ass  We got security here that the president doesn't need  I think  XM hasn't told us something 
[03:38:00]  Really?  Have we gotten threats or something?  Do you know this whole studio is built on an elevator  That if we're invaded  It drops down 15 stories below the crust of the earth  So we can still do the show  That's where the crust of the earth is?  Only 15 stories below  Only 15 stories below the crust of the earth here in Manhattan  It works for this little bit  Drops down a bedrock  What an idiot I am  Jesus, 15 stories  How about a geology class jerk off?  How about a couple miles minimum?  Hey, you know what's funny too about the whole security thing?  Norton loves it  He's like, oh, this is the greatest thing ever  He's just like  Norton loves it  That was part of our security detail 
[03:38:30]  Just find out what it was  Because the Kevlar  Oh, there he is  Master Poe's got his clipboard  Norton's the most paranoid guy I know  Yet he's the biggest danger to himself  Right  Like he's the guy he should be worried about  Right  He wants to be well secured  When he's doing this radio show  But he bangs a hooker without a bag  Yeah, I mean  They could spit out that razor blade  Into the front teeth  And slit his throat  As they're doing him  Right  Alright  Let's say hi to Andrew in Queens  Hey, Andrew  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[03:39:00]  What's up?  Hey, did anybody ask the question  What in the fuck is Al Sharpton  Getting married in Vegas for?  The guy's a reverend  He doesn't have his own fucking church  Obviously, I was gambling  And I crapped out  Oh, I'm punching out  Grove Sheet families, nigga  Alright  Very good  Yeah, why was he getting  Isn't he a reverend?  Couldn't he go to a church and get married?  He got married in Vegas?  That guy was the biggest fake  I mean, he's not as much a fake anymore  Because he's kind of presenting himself  As an entertainer  Right  More than anything else 
[03:39:30]  With the TV show and his appearances  But  He was a big fake  When he's trying to  Be a reverend  I'm sorry  I'm really distracted  What is that?  It's our new Jägermeister machine  That's the ride  Oh, it came in  Yeah, and then it's coming  They're coming with Jägermeister  Oh, look at everyone  Applauding in the other booth  The Jägermeister machine has arrived?  Yeah  And Jäger's coming in  With some of the Jägorettes on Tuesday  And they're going to fill it up  What's a Jägorettes?  They're more gals  Oh, they're the Jäger girls?  Yeah  I love the booze girls  More girls that aren't going to do anything 
[03:40:00]  But they're cool  Because you don't expect anything out of them  And they're just kind of good to look at  They wear their little skirts  They dress them up all slutty  Because they want to sell the booze  So they put them in little green dresses and stuff  Right  Remember Bud Girls?  Of course  And the Kahlua Girls?  It's just great  And also Earl has arrived  Oh, great  An hour and a half late  Great  Mr. Excitement is here for our show  Why is he late coming here?  What could he possibly have been doing?  Bring Earl in 
[03:40:30]  Absolutely nothing  Here he comes  We're going to get one more play out of this  Presidential Apprentice thing  As we get Earl in here  Earl, how are you doing?  Hold on, let's see  Earl dressed completely in black  Of course, as usual  That's why we call him Black Earl  What's up, Earl?  Hello, everyone  Not the color of his skin, of course  It's the color of his clothes  Earl, why are you here?  Well, I got a call this morning  To wreck our show  Great  We're doing a good enough job at that  Ourselves  Then why would you call Earl to come in today? 
[03:41:00]  I don't know  I called Earl because there's chicks coming in  Earl, the chicks left an hour ago  Well, he was supposed to be here an hour ago  He missed the chicks  I told  Maybe Earl can come in on Reverend Al  Yeah, you heard the Reverend is getting divorced, right?  After 24 years  One of the leaders of your black community  Did you know he was married to a trainee?  No  Did you see the picture of him?  No, I haven't  And I'm talking about his wife  Yeah  I didn't make a mistake there  Gruesome  Really bad  Oh my god 
[03:41:30]  Oh, there it is  Master Poe, is that machine checked out?  Yes  It's not an explosive?  There's no plastic explosives in that thing?  Don't worry, Mr. Gopher  It's not a plastic explosive or anything  That is the new version of the Jägermeister machine  Ben, what is that?  That's not like the old one  Yeah, no  This is  They've redesigned these things  And it's faster  And it pours better  And it's a whole new  Stronger  These are brand new  We're actually one of the first groups of people  That have received one  Brand new  Brand new Jägermeister machine 
[03:42:00]  Coming into the studio  Brand new  It looks like a motor for  Like a drag car or something  It does  It looks like a dragster engine  Great  But it's a Jägermeister machine  It chills it  Look at the top, Opie  Three bottles of Jäger go in the top  Oh, that's where that goes  Okay  The magazine  Right, right, right  And then it chills it to an icy, icy cold temperature  And then you do your shots out of that  And who doesn't love chilled Jäger?  It was hard to get the machine by Steve's studio  Oh, I bet  Want to make a little detour?  Yeah  How do we get it up here without the drunk at the desk not stealing it? 
[03:42:30]  Probably going to want to commission every time we have a drink  We're going to have to take one down for his drunken ass  He's probably not working anymore, right?  I think he finishes up at like eight or so  Does he?  Yeah, yeah  He's like the graveyard shift guy  Show Earl the picture of Reverend Al  That's nice  Where's the daily news?  Where'd you put it open?  The daily snooze?  I might have threw her  Yeah, she looks  Yeah, here it is, okay  Look at Reverend Al's wife  What do you think, Earl? 
[03:43:00]  Be honest, Earl  What do you think, Earl?  That's a dude  Yeah  That's a total dude  It's a guy  It looks like a guy who became a  Oh my God  Someone said it looks like  Well, someone  Reverend Al himself  Wink, wink  Said that it looks like Dennis Rodman in a wig  Yep  With clown makeup on  Maybe it's a bad picture  Yeah, it's probably  I hope it's a bad picture  You know something?  If I didn't know he was married for 24 years  He was obviously hiding her  Yeah, I didn't know that  And ashamed of her  He's hanging out with Robin Givens now 
[03:43:30]  All right, Earl  You have nothing  What?  What'd I do now?  Earl  Earl  So Earl said today on the show  It looks like a guy  Thanks, Earl  Thanks, Earl  Anything else before we shut your mic off?  What'd I do now?  The problem is you did nothing  You asked me for a comment, I gave one  All right, very good  There he goes, Earl  Another brilliant appearance from Earl  Earl, coming this summer  A black man dressed all in black 
[03:44:00]  All right, and as we go to break  Going out to dinner and not picking up the tab  It's Earl  Earl, when was the last time you paid  Wait a minute  I want to clear this up right now  Oh, there you go  Come on  Do I or do I not always throw money?  I hear some nigger rage, motherfucker  Come on  Come on, Earl  This whole idea  What do I do every time a check comes?  Run  No, don't run  Fail me now  The first word  You leave an Earl-shaped  Breakout in the wall 
[03:44:30]  The first thing I say  Go to the bathroom  What is your damage?  Yeah, I said what  Your damage is you never pay the bill  What?  I always offer to pay  He was like  No, you offer to pay?  Earl, here's the deal  You've got to offer to pay for the other guy, too  Not just your share  I've never seen Earl ready to pick up the tab  I pick up a lot of tabs  It would be nice if someone picked up a tab for me every once in a while  Ben picks up a tab every once in a while  Norton picks up a tab  I always offer  And you always say  Don't worry about it  Always  Always  Because you open up your wallet 
[03:45:00]  And there's a lot of dust on it  Like it's not opened a lot  Wait, where's Opie's wallet is saying this?  Mix 1027 cards come out  Dude, I don't have to defend myself  I pick up a lot of checks  When it comes right down to it  No, without question  The old T-Rex arm thing is just a funny bit, sure  But when it comes down to business, I'm picking up checks  No, absolutely  But I always offer  You have to offer to pay for others  That's the key  Not just your share  Always  It's almost like you want to pull out a calculator  And figure it out to the penny  No  What's the tip? 
[03:45:30]  Where to what percent?  Earl  It's Earl Douglasburg  I understand you don't make much money  But I always offer  Do you rub a mezuzah when you go in your front door of your house?  No?  No mezuzah?  What are you hiding under that black Yankee cap?  Earl  What's wrong, Steve?  Do you have payas?  Oh  Do you have payas on the sides of your head under that hat?  Do you flop the little curly cues up underneath it? 
[03:46:00]  Is that what that's called?  Yeah  Oh, alright  Payas  Are you hiding a yarmulke underneath that Yankee hat?  No  Alright, listen  Thank you, Earl  I'll let you pay next time, okay?  And then  You want to take us all out to dinner, Earl?  And foot the bill?  I don't care  I'll pay  I've always offered to pay  We'll go somewhere nice  Nice  Order something  Earl will give us a menu we can order from  Just order these items  Why don't we go to break?  Everything else is a little too expensive  We're going to go to break  Alrighty  We got this apprentice audio one last time 
[03:46:30]  I think we can play this  And then we'll play What Do We Learn Next, okay?  Check this out  Okey doke  Mr. Trump is ready to see you  George  What happened?  We thought we'd find stockpiles  The whole world thought we'd find stockpiles  Is that your fault?  Well, I mean, there's 30 nations now involved in Iraq  You think you were a good leader?  Uh, gosh, I, uh, you know  Uh, I would, I, uh  You know, I don't get that  I wanted this president to give meaning to the words 
[03:47:00]  Uh, John  Going to war as a last  John  Resort  I don't believe he did  You would have shut up  I mean, you're probably not going to be chosen  John Edwards and I both believe that  Why do you keep talking?  And I'm committed  I'm in the middle of saying something  And then you blurt out  Whatever the hell you blurt  That nobody knows what it means anyway  Why do you keep doing that?  I agree with all of the above  And the answer is yes  George  Had we not moved  Saddam Hussein would be even more powerful  So you think John should be fired?  He'd be bad  You would fire John?  Yeah, absolutely 
[03:47:30]  Fire the person  John, you made some bad decisions  Yes  And you admit that you made some bad decisions  But no  John, you're fired  He didn't  Not me  Go ahead, I'm sorry  Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode  Evil  And loving it  The Opie and Anthony Show  I almost broke my vagina

I still have one eyeball left in the socket  It's good music  It has a message  Kill Whitey  And white people are dancing to it  I love this song  It mentions my name twice 
[03:48:30]  I like rap, man  I don't care when they mess with a turntable  Sounds like a fat chick walking in corduroys  Please welcome MC Chafe  Remember, they call rap  They call scratching an art form  Remember the old days  You were at a party  You bumped into the turntable  You're an asshole  Now you're a musical genius 
[03:49:00]  Is he drunk?  No, he's cutting an album  Get away from the turntable, Bill  Fuck you, I'm good  Give me a contract  Now rappers are shooting each other  Finally  If we could just get the country and western people to join in  It'll be a perfect world  I'd hate to see Billy Ray Cyrus take a cap in the achy breaky ass 
[03:49:30]  That would suck  Boy, we wouldn't want to lose that talent, would we?  Rappers are shooting each other  It's getting crazy over music, man  Remember the old days  There was a shooting  Cops used to look through mug photos  Now they look through the R&B section  At Tower Records  So, uh, what's, I need a vacation  Obviously I'm a tad stressed  And, uh  Just when you had time to take a breather

[03:54:00]  Uh, Al Mack, always good for one  He learned that Opie got a jump shot and Anthony got pussy  Yeah  Uh, George from Philly  I learned that Godzilla steps on less than Pablo Francisco  Very good  Uh, Joey DVDs  I learned that Anthony, his brother, and his father all share not only the same taste in women  But the same women  And Chris from Boston  Today I learned Anthony had the coolest dad ever, ever, ever  That's right  Ever  Did we actually make it through our first hundred hours of programming? 
[03:54:30]  Is that what, uh, Fast Freddy is saying?  I know Opie knows things like this  Well, Anthony  You can probably do the math in your head  What, oh, oh, oh, oh  What does that mean?  Two minutes  Oh  When did we start this?  That's a joke, Ben  Ben's looking at me like  Ben's like, what?  Wait, God, do I have to answer that?  What the  Uh, yeah, this is the end of our fifth week at XM Satellite Radio  And that would add up to a hundred hours of fine broadcasting  Hey  Out of the hundred hours, I'll be honest, I think we've done 88 good hours 
[03:55:00]  There you go  That's a good percentage  88 good hours  And we've done probably 99 hours of much too sexual material for whack bag  For some reason, uh, it's too much sex  No sex for the faggots today  Yeah  No sex for you faggots  But they'll have something else to complain about  Let's see, let's say hi to Tommy in Brooklyn  Hey, Tommy  Hey, how are you guys?  You know what I learned today?  That Anthony's a homophobe  He didn't pee for five weeks because Norton was there 
[03:55:30]  That's true  I, I, for the first time I pee in five weeks is when Norton isn't here  Because he follows everyone into the bathroom  It was kind of strange, though  What?  You finally got up from your chair  Yeah  You've sat in that chair for a hundred hours, by the way  No, I've stood up to stretch  During the breaks, I walk around, stretch a little bit, look out the window  Uh-huh  Drink some more coffee, go to the bathroom with Master Poe for some reason  Yeah  And finally today, you made the walk to the bathroom to see what it was all about, Anthony  I stand up and stretch while I'm reading 
[03:56:00]  Let's go to Steve in Jersey  Hey, Steve, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys? Welcome back  Thank you  Thank you, Steve  I learned there's too much sex on the O&A show  Fucking homos  Also, that Anthony banged a Univag core magnum  There you have it  Univag, yes  Alright, he's out  Let's say hi to Alan in Sacramento  Norton playing the punchline in Sacramento this weekend  Go ahead, Alan  Oh, that's part of what I learned  But the other part of what I learned is I should have paid attention in international finance class 
[03:56:30]  No kidding, man  Yeah, wow  Oh, what?  Oh, I think we're out of here  Thank you, Alan  You were the last call of week five  We'll see you Monday  How do you propose we get an entire nation to sit through a massive picture?  The O.P. and Anthony Show  I had an uncle that went crazy  Crazy, man  Everybody's got a crazy uncle  He's usually your favorite uncle when you're a kid, too  You don't realize he's crazy until you're about 15 
[03:57:00]  No wonder Bobby was so much fun  He's out of his fucking mind  My uncle Bobby lost his mind  You know what people do when they lose their mind?  They start repeating shit that don't mean nothing  Every time you ask Bobby a question, you answer it the same way  Bobby, what time is it?  If you want to feel funky, feel free  Please don't spread that funk on me  What did that mean? 
[03:57:30]  I'll never know  You know what cartoon I used to hate when I was a kid?  Fat Albert and the Cosby kids  It's like the most racist, most degrading cartoon in the history of television  I actually had a guy walking around with a damn hat pulled over his head  And another guy going to  Weeple go to the store 
[03:58:00]  My name is Babel  It's like, hey, hey, hey, I'm illiterate  Egg rinse  Hi, my name is Debbie Ellis, can I help you?  Yes, I'm looking to fill a permanent position  Certainly, now what kind of position are you looking to fill? 
[03:58:30]  I'm looking to fill doggy style is the position  What is that?  Doggy style  I beg your pardon?  Doggy style  Which means?  Which means, you know, in the rear  You're driving  This is your daily commute  You tune in your XM radio  You pay little attention, if any, to the road 
[03:59:00]  You are approaching the Chesapeake Bay Bridge  Suddenly, for no apparent reason, you pull the wheel strongly to the right  Your car is pole vaulted into the air  Gravity takes a hold and you head to the water  The impact is like concrete  Then you slowly submerge  Feeling the cold presence of wetness 
[03:59:30]  Oxygen is slowly purged from your vehicle  And for a moment, you think to yourself  Man, my XM radio sounds so good  Man  It's the O&A virus  XM 202  XM news, talk, sports, and information  It's everything, all the time  It's the opposite 
[04:00:00]  All the time  All the time  You're gonna see  There's a blood  You're gonna go  Everything  You're gonna grab  It's the O&A virus  We're gonna burn  And it's the O&A virus  Now we're gonna get  It's the O&A virus  We're gonna have  A few of the things  It's not  The O&A virus  What makes it  We're gonna have  To the O&A virus  To the O&A virus </pre>
