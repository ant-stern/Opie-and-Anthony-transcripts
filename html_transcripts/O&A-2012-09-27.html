<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with the hosts' characteristically vulgar and comedic banter, featuring fart jokes and sexually explicit comments.  Jim Norton, introduced as a "lover of the transgender," was in studio.  The NFL referees' strike and their return were discussed, with the hosts boasting of having predicted the outcome.  A significant portion of the show was devoted to a viral hula hoop video featuring a woman in yoga pants, prompting detailed descriptions and humorous commentary from the hosts and listener reactions.  This was followed by a discussion of "The Biggest Horse Pimple," a graphic video of a horse abscess being drained, eliciting both disgust and fascination, and leading to listener calls and further descriptions.  Other viral videos, including one depicting a Taliban fighter's death, were also mentioned.  Jim Norton recounted a meeting with Carol Burnett, Tim Conway, and Vicki Lawrence. A caller thanked Opie for his role in Sam Roberts' viral iPhone review, leading to a discussion with Roberts about the video's reception and comparisons to Drake and Verne Troyer.  The show previewed upcoming guests Matt Paxton from *Hoarders* and Dinesh D'Souza, and Mike Tyson's new daytime talk show.  Brief mentions were made of a cow with a massive abscess, the Occupy protesters' settlement, and fecal transplants.

A subsequent segment started with opinions on shows like *Breaking Bad*, *The Wire*, and *True Blood*.  This transitioned into a graphic description of a video from "Handjob Hub" showing a nurse masturbating a disabled man, with speculation on its authenticity and motives.  A discussion followed about a plane landing with a sideways nose gear at JFK, including a caller's account of the experience.  The hosts then critiqued local news, its perceived uselessness, and news reporters' behavior.  The infamous Life Alert commercial ("I've fallen and I can't get up") was dissected, with calls from listeners, including an EMT recounting finding an elderly woman lying in her own feces for five days.  Opie discussed a basketball trick shot video he made and the frustration of others re-uploading it without credit.  Dinesh D'Souza appeared briefly to promote his documentary.

Dinesh D'Souza's interview dominated a large segment, focusing on his documentary "2016: Obama's America" and its criticisms of President Obama.  Topics included Obama's upbringing, alleged connections to radical figures like Bill Ayers, his academic records, economic policies, foreign policy (particularly regarding the Middle East and Israel), and the racial dynamics of his presidency.  Audio clips from Obama's audiobooks were used as evidence.  D'Souza discussed his debate with Jesse Jackson, calling Jackson and Al Sharpton "shakedown men."  Eliza Schlesinger joined the conversation, offering her political perspective.  The segment ended with a humorous, vulgar discussion involving videos of animal zits.

A later segment featured shocking and humorous videos, including a video of a fat black woman falling, described as surpassing the Zapruder film.  The hosts discussed their online habits, including accidentally finding home birth videos.  Pornography and graphic online content were discussed, with one host expressing a preference for separating porn from violence.  Eliza Schlesinger discussed her peculiar Google search results related to foot fetishes and showed a highly graphic video of explicit sex on a bus.  Matt Paxton from *Hoarders* joined, recounting horrifying experiences cleaning hoarders' homes, including details of finding massive amounts of urine, liquefied cats, decomposed bodies, and a house with two feet of cobwebs teeming with cockroaches.  He described the psychological toll of his work, and the hosts discussed violence, substance abuse, and death within that context.  Paxton recounted a particularly graphic anecdote about a discovered scalp.  Listeners' "F.U." messages were also read.

A segment featured a series of profane "fuck yous" to various people and groups, including Nikki Sixx and the hosts' ex-wives.  They advertised an audiobook, "50 Shades of Gay," using explicit language.  Eliza Schlesinger discussed her dating life and unconventional approach to dating.  The hosts and Schlesinger engaged in sexually charged banter.  Jim Norton's Blackberry and its case became a running joke.  Upcoming guests Frank Oz, Anthony Bourdain, and Bob Kelly were announced, along with mentions of Matt Paxton's podcast and Eliza Schlesinger's show, "Excused."  The Marlon Brando discussion, including anecdotes from a listener, concluded the segment.  The "After Opie and Anthony Live" segment was mentioned along with further guest discussions.

Finally, an interview with race car driver Danica Patrick began by discussing her background, family, and engagement ring.  Her husband's support for her career and their prioritization of financial gain from endorsements was discussed, along with his profession as a physical therapist and how they met.  The physical demands of racing were addressed, and Patrick recounted an embarrassing on-air moment where she mistakenly called John Walsh "Adam."  A clip of this was played.  The interview concluded with a discussion of Patrick's involvement in a COPD awareness campaign (drive4copd.org), and the hosts playfully engaged with the COPD screener questionnaire.  The prevalence and potential fatality of COPD were discussed before the show ended.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Anthony show.  Motory 4 has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent. 
[00:00:30]  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stopped.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Woo!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And conventions burn to the ground.  Would you like to make some fun to be second?  Woo!  With Opie, the destroyer.  Just pay us, you assholes!  And we'll continue.  Anthony, the rage.  Shut the fuck up.  Come to my pool and drown in it.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do this.  Morning.  Here we are.  NFL refs are coming back.  Breaking news.  Are they?  Yeah.  The NFL refs are coming back for tonight's game.  So they're gonna be rusty.  They're gonna be rusty as all hell.  And I think we need to say, we told you so. 
[00:02:00]  Why do we get it right and no one else does?  I don't know.  What did we say?  We basically said they're coming back sooner than later.  Yeah, they would have to.  Or I certainly did.  It was getting crazy.  I think the NFL was getting very nervous about lawsuits and whatnot.  Yeah.  Because if one of these guys gets really hurt because the ref fucked up, I think the NFL  would have a big problem on their hands.  Yeah.  And then, of course, the outrage.  They say when a sports story is talked about on regular news by these dumb broads that read 
[00:02:30]  the news to you these days, that's when people react and get things done.  If it's just on the sports pages, they don't care as much.  But as soon as it goes into the front of the news, as they say, they said that had a lot  to do with it as well.  So I don't know if they have an actual agreement.  It's a little weird.  They're coming back tonight, but they still got to vote.  So maybe the refs could still say, ah, we're not happy with this. 
[00:03:00]  I guess in good faith.  Yeah.  In good faith.  NFL and referees reach an agreement on new eight-year contract will officiate tonight's game.  But I heard they still have to vote on that.  Yeah.  So I guess it's pretty much done, right?  Yeah, done deal.  They should absolutely thank the replacement refs.  Right.  Because they're the reason that they got the deal that they wanted.  And the replacement refs were the only ones that didn't see this coming.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Back to their whatever gigs they had before this.  Well, a lot of people think Foot Locker.  Yes.  I'm so sick of seeing the Foot Locker jokes on Twitter about this.  I get it.  They used to work at Foot Locker.  Some people on Twitter just have no goddamn clue about it.  We've probably seen it before.  Don't worry about it, especially if it's been around for a while. 
[00:04:00]  Hey, guys, I heard the refs, they got them from Foot Locker.  Really?  That's hilarious.  I don't know how many fucking people were tweeting me hula hoop girls.  So what's wrong with that?  Because they're not good ones.  They're not like some guy tweets me this disgusting fucking stripper bitch with these big fake tits.  And she's hula hooping.  And you don't see the difference between what we watched yesterday, which was just like hotness and stuff. 
[00:04:30]  Perfection.  And some slob fucking hula hooping.  Well, you are right, because everyone has their favorite hula hoop girl now.  And you're like, oh, she's nothing.  You got to check this one out.  Oh, that girl's a pig.  There was just something about the hula hoop girl from yesterday.  It was the whole package.  The music.  She knew exactly what she was doing with her body, but it was kind of subtle.  Subtle.  Which is kind of hot.  She didn't come off looking like stripper hot.  Right.  At the end of that one video that we're all focusing on with that band that now everyone likes, and I forgot the band already. 
[00:05:00]  Of course.  Even though I listened to the song three or four times yesterday easily, the regular version, and then listened to it again because I watched the video a few times.  Well, you have to.  She could have shook her ass the entire fucking video.  Right.  You see that quick shake at the end of the video?  Oh.  Yep.  If she wanted to go over the top, she could have done a lot more of that.  Yeah.  But she knew, no, man, I'm just going to fucking work this hoop a little bit for everybody.  Nice.  Subtle.  It worked.  You know, I couldn't get back to everyone yesterday, but a lot of people had me howling with their tweets about the hula hoop girl. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Howling.  One guy, I think I did retweet saying that he had to recharge his phone three times.  Oh, his phone three times.  Three times yesterday.  Keep watching it.  Because of the hula hoop girl.  Your phone's blazing hot because it's using a lot of video.  One guy didn't leave work.  One guy said he stayed at work an extra two hours because he was caught in a hula hoop fucking video.  What would you call it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, when you get trapped in certain videos. 
[00:06:00]  He said it started with that and he just could not go home.  Yeah, because YouTube's brilliant in that when the video stops, they give you the other suggestions there.  The options, yeah.  And boy, you just can keep going and going.  Going and going.  It's great.  And, you know, and then everyone's talking about the Burning Man hula hoop POV.  It's nice, but there was something about this one.  Yeah.  And websites are picking it up all over the place now.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This thing is going to be massive.  She's very pretty, Katie.  I was talking about her last night. 
[00:06:30]  I saw Bobby and his wife.  Bobby.  I was talking about how I'm in love with Katie Sunshine.  Katie Sunshine.  I want her to be my girl.  It's all about Katie Sunshine.  Your girl.  Katie, what do you want to do later?  I'm going to hold a hoop for her.  All right.  I'll be after.  Oh, God.  We're going to watch it again.  We're terrible.  How can you send one that's hotter than this?  This is.  And I like that she's wearing the yoga pants.  I do, too.  Gray's a good color for yoga pants because it shows everything.  And everyone's picking apart the video now.  They're like, why is it one guy looking at her? 
[00:07:00]  If you look around in the crowd, not one person is looking at this.  Nice bend over.  You've got two idiots in the back with a cooler.  They're just like.  They have no idea what's happening a mere 20 feet away from them.  Look, those guys walked by.  They didn't look.  They're just stoned hippies.  She's a very good hula girl.  Oh, man.  There she goes.  I wish I could do that.  And she's trying to get some.  She's talking to people.  Look, that guy doesn't look. 
[00:07:30]  Look at the piggies.  I had no idea.  But he had an opportunity to look, and he did not look.  This fucking song, too.  I like it.  Yeah.  Do you like the song?  She has cute shoes on, too.  I hear this song is massively popular, too.  I had no idea.  Yeah.  Really popular.  Oh, my God.  No, it just puts the brakes on the show every time.  I know.  I know.  Jesus.  You're terrible.  But you know what?  We bring up shit every day on this show. 
[00:08:00]  This one took off yesterday.  Yeah.  It was just one of those things that everyone started talking about and tweeting about yesterday.  Yeah.  And a lot of people make me laugh with their comments.  I try to get back to people.  You get back to the Twitter people?  A few.  I try.  I mean, I can't answer every goddamn gun question.  I get it.  This guy walks by with his pal with a cooler.  They didn't look.  Look at the guy in the back.  No one's looking.  No.  What the fuck?  Look at that guy.  He sort of took a quick look and is meandering across the lawn. 
[00:08:30]  They're probably used to her by now.  She's been there all day.  They've had her with the hula hooping.  Every picnic, she shows up.  Hey, did you see that?  Yes, I did.  Trying to play softball.  She's there hula hooping.  That guy almost looked.  But they're not really looking.  No, it's not even a glance.  Right.  And that band is playing live.  There's only 10 people watching that.  Wow, that's the part of the video where everyone stopped and made a picture of. 
[00:09:00]  Where she's leaning over and looking at the camera.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  She's a lovely girl.  I guarantee you she has a fiancée.  She's probably not married.  She probably has a fiancée.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look, that guy just ducked out of the way of the hula hoop.  Not looking.  That guy in the orange shirt is like, hey, man, what's up?  Which tells you that she has a very large boyfriend who's filming this.  Oh, you think that's what it is?  Oh, maybe that's it.  I love this guy.  Oh, this friggin'.  This guy's so fucked up.  It's like 12 people watching the band. 
[00:09:30]  And this is the best ever.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's a great movie.  I want to know who films her.  There's one guy filming her every time.  I guarantee it's her fucking stupid boyfriend.  I watch most of the videos, and you can tell she just kind of places it on the ground,  maybe with a little tripod or something, or put it on a bench or a table.  I want to kiss her cheek.  And everyone's like, hey, man, that one's good, but you got to check out this one. 
[00:10:00]  Everyone has their favorite one, but I like the one that started it all for me.  I can't believe how good that one is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  The one that started it all here.  We went from really hot to disgusting on my Twitter yesterday.  Did you see the horse thing yet?  I tweeted really late.  No, I saw the title of it.  I wasn't going to go.  No.  I was laying in bed.  I did one last.  I'll check my Twitter, and this guy sent me a video, and I wish Bob Kelly was here today.  I'm not watching.  Oh, pause this.  Pause this. 
[00:10:30]  I won't watch this.  You won't watch this?  No, it gets me queasy.  You won't watch this?  No.  Really?  Nope.  Not at all.  What is it called there, Sam?  The Biggest Horse Pimple.  Yeah, we're on a roll with these hot videos lately.  I'm sorry.  Hot.  They're hot.  Hot meaning on the internet.  I mean, they're no iPhone 5 for no reason.  No, they're not.  Well, nothing really is.  Holy fuck.  What are you up to?  2.5.  God.  Oh, my God.  God. 
[00:11:00]  Damn.  Oh, you're at 2.5?  Yeah, I hit 2 million at like...  No one cares what time.  We don't need your timeline.  Oh, Jesus.  What's he...  The time he hit 2 million?  And he's going to go, you know, I didn't really believe in this video until it hit 2 million.  Yes.  I told Sam he's looking at at least 6 to 7 million.  Yeah, he might be.  At least.  However, the fact that he's talking to us like we're Charlie Rose.  Oh, God.  When did you hit 2 million?  Anyway.  When did you hit 2 million?  I hit 2 million last night, and by this morning, it was already at 2.5.  It's going faster since it got...  Oh, no.  I thought I'd be done by now because it's timely.  No, man, because then what happens? 
[00:11:30]  All the websites start embedding it.  I'm telling you, it's a monster.  You got a monster in your hand.  Has your life changed?  Anyone call you?  Nobody's called me.  I'm still getting emails on a daily basis from people who either like the video or think  I'm a bully.  Yeah, you are a bully.  I mean, I've been getting several...  Did you get the Verne Troyer lookalike thing yet?  I read that on some comments.  She looks like Verne Troyer.  A little bit.  Yeah.  But people have actually gone to the website and found my email just so they could tell  me what a just terrible person I am and how I couldn't have taken that video down 
[00:12:00]  by now.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  I like her dumb face with her mouth.  I love how she's just proud of herself with her dumb answer.  It looks like she's constantly trying to get like peanut butter off the roof of her  mouth.  Right.  Yeah.  Or Fig Newtons between her teeth and her cheek.  She's like...  So you're not going to be like the Leave Me Alone kid, Leave Brittany Alone, or the other  kid at the dentist?  No, she is.  The girl is.  Sam is interviewing her. 
[00:12:30]  Is there nothing out of this?  I'm the vehicle for her.  Oh, that's...  He's but a conduit.  But, I mean, you know, it will draw attention to future projects.  Oh, is that it?  Hopefully.  That's right.  For her.  And for me, it's drawn attention to...  And for me.  All of the other iPhone videos.  I noticed that SiriusXM tweeted the video finally.  That's what put it over the top.  Oh, boy.  I got douche chills reading that.  I'm like...  Because, you know, the only reason they did that was because we beat them up again. 
[00:13:00]  I went and had a conversation yesterday.  With who?  The Radio Wizard?  With Gary, yeah.  His name's not Gary anymore.  Well...  The Radio Wizard.  He's terrific.  So needs a pointy hat.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Anyway...  I had a text guy yesterday to help me.  I wanted to meet...  Oh, Carol Burnett.  And Tim Conway and Vicki Lawrence.  Yes.  Were you allowed to sit in the fishbowl?  I didn't ask, but here's why.  Because there was only like 10 or 12 seats in there or 15 seats, but they were all contest  people who had pre...  A lot of them had pre-written questions, so I didn't... 
[00:13:30]  Pre...  My thing is this.  If I wanted to, maybe I could have, but I didn't ask.  Jimmy's way nicer than me, because I would go, look, there's 15, 16 seats in here.  You can't sneak another chair in.  No one will ever fucking know.  And I'll sit there like a contest winner.  Well, I didn't ask because I pee, and I didn't want to be trapped in there for an hour.  Right.  And Amy was fucking great.  Amy was a good interviewer.  Amy was great.  She did a great job interviewing them.  Good for Amy.  She looked great, and so yeah, what they did was...  There's an Asian girl who works here.  I don't remember her name, but she was kind of helping out in talent, and she might be 
[00:14:00]  here a lot.  And she goes, okay, what we'll do is we'll get you right on line first.  They took great care of me yesterday, so that just reminded me of that when you said  Gary.  I saw the picture.  You're very happy.  I couldn't have been happier with those legends.  Tim Conway's a legend.  They're all legends, obviously.  I mean, when he did that golf thing, I was like, ugh.  Dwarf, yeah.  Tim Conway.  Tim Conway.  But you know, you ask the younger people around here, because I was talking to somebody,  I go, Tim Conway.  And they said, oh, the young people, the stupid Roland. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, the dwarf guy?  And I'm like, do you understand who this guy was before he did that silly fucking midget  golf shit?  Do you understand who you were talking to?  It's Roland.  Yeah, you're right.  And you know what?  That thing made him a lot of fucking money, but he's way funnier than that.  He was funny yesterday in the interview, too.  He was, huh?  The timing, Carol Burnett had a really funny line.  They all enjoyed Amy very much, but Amy's opening was just, she was a little gushing  and just saying how much I, you know, I love you guys and my whole goal is just to not 
[00:15:00]  annoy you.  And then Carol Burnett said, well, then leave the room.  That's great.  It was hilarious.  Good timing.  Yeah, they all have really, really great timing still.  And Vicki Lawrence looked great.  I've heard some things about Carol Burnett.  How was she?  Was she nice?  Oh, have you heard that she, uh...  I've heard some things.  Difficult?  I've heard some things.  I've met her twice.  You got your picture, remember.  Yeah, yeah.  You can be honest right now.  We said hello.  She wasn't, she was friendly. 
[00:15:30]  She said hello and she smiled, but I mean, I think at her age, she's probably, she's got  to be pushing 80, right?  Wow.  I think so.  I think she's 79, actually.  She's been a star for a long time.  Her show came on in 67.  No.  Yeah, 67 to 78, that show ran.  Whoa.  77, 87, 97.  That's 40, that's almost 50 years of being, and she was famous before then.  Right.  So.  They had amazing skits.  Oh my God.  I've been on YouTube the last few days just watching fucking, Eunice is obviously my favorite.  I've been watching just that and the dynamics of Eunice. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, is she great?  Yeah, she was really fucking something.  They were really good together, man.  Anyway.  Does Conway do stand-up anymore?  Did he ever do stand-up?  I don't know.  I thought so.  Am I wrong about that?  I don't know.  I think he might have...  I don't know.  I think he might have...  I don't know.  But they was...  So they got me online first for my picture.  Well, that's nice of SiriusXM.  And the girl whose name...  I don't remember her name who works here.  I...  And she actually took my two photos back to get signed.  Yeah.  So I had...  Everybody was very, very nice.  So thank you. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Good.  And Gary actually got that started because I texted him and he...  You smile like that when you're really happy, huh?  Dude, I couldn't have been...  I was just standing...  Yeah, you're like...  With Carol Burnett.  Where's this picture?  On your Twitter, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Vicky Lawrence and Tim Conway.  Jim Norton on Twitter.  You gotta see his smile.  I...  That was a genuine smile, too.  I wasn't being silly.  No, I know.  I was just fucking thrilled.  That's a good one.  I would like that picture, actually.  Yeah.  Tim Sabian jumped in right after.  It was like...  Even he stuck around.  He never sticks around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But who kid stopped and was watching them? 
[00:17:00]  Everybody stopped and was just watching them.  Did you call anyone a nigga?  No, but he was enjoying the interview.  He was.  Yeah, it was really weird to watch...  You always think that black people and white people always enjoy different shit.  Sure.  But I was watching, like, Who Kidding, some other guy he was talking to, and, like, they  were laughing and enjoying...  I guess Carol Burnett's kind of a legend to everybody.  Bringing together the races.  Well, just here.  All right.  I'm sure gangbangers wouldn't have enjoyed it.  Tim motherfucking Conway, yo.  Yeah.  Got a very important phone call coming in from Steve in Virginia. 
[00:17:30]  Yes.  We usually don't go to the phones this early, but, uh, Steve, what do you got, sir, for  the show?  Hey, uh, I've noticed that Sam has not yet thanked Opie for making that viral video for  him, because without Opie saying, hey, you need to edit that, Sam would still be shit.  I kind of remember saying that to you, Sam.  Oh, boy.  Do I get the big, uh, thank you, or what?  Of course.  I thanked you on the Sunday show when I was telling the whole story.  No one listens to the Sunday show, right?  This is prime time.  That's like saying I thanked you in the shower. 
[00:18:00]  I get lots and lots of callers.  Because it's a surprisingly high listener show.  Oh, boy.  People are saying I'm jealous.  Well, maybe I am.  I don't think that...  But I also helped Sam as much as I could.  Opie was very...  He had the content.  I'm not even going to...  Fell right into a viral video.  Yeah, I'm not going to say he didn't have the content.  And then I helped him with a few little things I know about, uh, the internets.  Yep.  Opie was a big help.  He gave the first suggestion.  He said, you got to make Rachel her own video.  I said, really?  He said, yep.  And then I went home.  Oh, you didn't see that. 
[00:18:30]  Huh?  Oh, you didn't see that.  What?  I thought I was just saying something you knew.  Because you seem to know everything.  I do.  I mean, I know almost everything.  But...  I'm just fucking with you, bro.  But yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then, Justin Stengel made the same remark, but you made yours like 12 hours before him.  So you get first credit for sure.  So, Opie Radio, greater than Justin Stengel on Twitter.  In terms of timing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got to say it. 
[00:19:00]  I'm greater than a Letterman writer.  It was the right video for the right time.  That's how I see it.  It was a perfect storm.  Of course.  Of course.  You found a fucking lunatic.  Yeah.  Very topical subject.  Oh, extremely topical.  Very passionate people, the Apple people, and the people that don't like Apple.  I mean, both.  And you found the right person.  And the right person who was there to do the interviewing.  That's it.  Well, what?  Sam has a different look, though.  That's one thing that's working for Sam is that you're an interesting looking guy. 
[00:19:30]  I mean, as much as I find you, fairly repulsive to look at.  But I mean, you are.  People would look at that video because you don't look like every other guy doing interviews.  Bossip, which is black gossip.  Bossip.com called me a Drake lookalike.  Oh, really?  Never.  I'm trying to figure it out too, Jim.  Not supposed.  Oh.  There he is.  Some people told me it made World Star Hip Hop, which I know.  Yeah.  But a bunch of people on Twitter told me you've got to read some of the comments like you did  with Jimmy's video that made it there.  I read it.  Could you like kind of? 
[00:20:00]  I read a couple.  I'd rather not do a cold.  Try to find some good ones later on in the show.  My favorite one was, is the interviewer supposed to be black?  I'm just like, what?  Well, that's what we've been figuring out for years.  You look like you could be black.  But it's not supposed to be.  Like, it's like a...  What do you mean?  To say he's supposed to be black is to say I'm doing a character.  You're a red one.  Maybe they thought it was a wig.  They might have thought Sam was wearing a wig.  Oh, I see what they're saying.  Yeah, we'll go to Jim in the comments.  Yeah, try to find a few of the better ones and we'll go back to that. 
[00:20:30]  But can we do the horse thing?  So this guy tweeted.  Now I'm learning that Daniel Tosh actually tweeted this video.  But a guy sent it to me and it's called, what, Largest Horse Pimple Ever or something?  The Biggest Horse Pimple.  This will be the new Two Girls, One Cup.  You're going to see reaction videos to this.  Have you seen this yet, Jimmy?  No, but I'm already getting my dick ready for a good tug.  We went from really sexy to this in one day.  That's the beauty of us. 
[00:21:00]  Fuck.  You're not going to watch it?  No, that's...  This thing, just play it.  I don't need to be disgusted before I eat.  Jimmy is watching for the first time.  Wow.  Oh, pause.  You know, it really does need a setup.  So what do you got, a veterinarian there with his gloves on and another guy helping?  And the veterinarian is kind of doing what you do with a pimple, kind of, you know, pushing  it.  Oh, God.  Pushing it from the sides to get the shit out.  And the other, the assistant is pouring water on it.  So it helps it along.  And it just keeps going and going and going. 
[00:21:30]  How much to eat that?  Ah, God.  I'm asking.  This is from Monetary Mount.  I know Pat Duffy would eat it.  Yeah.  In a second.  Horse pus?  Yeah, he would do it in a second.  It's a great name for a band.  Oh, yeah.  The beauty of Pat Duffy, I know E-Rock's been great over the years, but the beauty of Pat  Duffy, you've never seen him, like, hesitate.  No.  No.  You tell him to do something, he doesn't even think of the consequences.  He just goes for it.  E-Rock has had to kind of think about it, you know, here and there. 
[00:22:00]  E-Rock actually, Pat Duffy's a psychopath.  Well, yeah.  But he was great on the show, man.  Pat was a fucking entertaining guy.  Oh, yeah.  I miss Pat Duffy.  I do, too.  Trying to figure out what we could do with him.  I do, too.  Hey, E-Rock, would you eat the horse pus?  No.  What if we had, like, cash involved on this one?  A couple thousand.  He doesn't care about cash.  He's got it.  He's got plenty of it.  Good point.  What, is he going to build another extension on his home?  No?  No, I can't eat a fluid from another body part. 
[00:22:30]  Can't hit fluid that came out of himself?  Zach, is that too many painful memories?  I just helped it a lot because it's a visual.  That is the S of the horse, too, yes.  All right, here we go for Jim Norton.  And I'll watch it again.  You're going to watch it, right, Sam?  Oh, my God.  Let's look at it.  It doesn't even look real.  How do you explain this to the radio audience before they see it themselves?  It looks like vomit lava.  Yes.  Every time the guy squeezes from the sides, a shitload of fucking, what is that? 
[00:23:00]  Sam, look at it.  You got to support someone else's pus.  This video comes out.  It's not that bad.  It's just fucking pus.  And then, look, there was some hard pus that he had.  Yeah, some gristle or something.  Yeah.  And then he goes, all right, now I'm back to getting this flowing again.  Sam's got to look at this.  Come on, Sam.  It's not right.  The other people watching.  It's not that bad.  Yes, it is.  I can't explain this.  It looks like.  You've really got to see it for yourself.  It looks like almost a strawberry yogurt is leaking out the top.  Right.  It's the size of a very large grapefruit. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, it looks like vomit.  Is the pimple.  And this guy goes, he works it for about three minutes.  Yeah, it's a big zit.  The horse is all embarrassed.  Well, the horse starts looking back like, what the fuck are you guys doing?  Well, you know what it is?  The horse has, the prom date is arriving.  And the horse is like, I can't go with my zit like this.  I have to be dancing.  And you know a little bit about horses.  Do they get pimples like this?  I've never seen it.  They must have gotten something in there and stuck in them and got them all infected.  Got them all infected. 
[00:24:00]  Do you know the way it's coming out is the way Reagan vomited.  Not the projectile vomit, but when she turned her head and just the vomit leaked out the side of the mouth in the exorcist.  I thought you meant Ronald.  Oh, no, no, no.  So did I.  That's how it's coming out, like that leaky green vomit.  But this is like a reddish color.  And the veterinarian is poking at it and just pushing and just working it.  Dude, doctors are a weird breed.  Like you have to be able to handle seeing this stuff, the smells you have to deal with.  Oh, my God. 
[00:24:30]  Now he's getting to the bottom of it.  There's the meat of it.  All right.  Now it's just fucking pouring out of the horse.  Oh, he's just pushing it.  And it's just pouring out now.  It's vomiting.  Look at that pus.  Oh, my God.  How much is coming out, would you guess?  I don't know.  Is it a gallon?  Oh, God.  It could be.  I would say.  That's probably a gallon total.  Half gallon.  Maybe a half gallon.  Okay.  Maybe a little more than a half gallon.  That's a lot.  I don't know.  It's red.  It's got it.  It looks like puke. 
[00:25:00]  It has texture.  It does look like vomit mixed with bits of skin.  This shit doesn't bother me, though.  Nah.  I could watch this.  It's not pleasant, but after you watch your head come off, it's all roses.  I could watch this, and I could actually push the sides and get some of it out.  Can you?  Oh, you mean in person?  Yeah, I could do what that guy's doing.  I wouldn't be good at it, but.  The smell might get you.  What do you think it's?  Oh, my God.  It probably just smells like a raw, rotting something. 
[00:25:30]  Like a belly button stench.  Like a rot.  It's starting to look like pizza after it's been puked up.  Wow.  We've seen the pizza puke up on the sidewalks.  Most of us have at this point.  Horses are even embarrassed.  Looks like that.  You think he's relieved or like, what the fuck?  This isn't bothering me.  Maybe, but they get their cock sheaths cleaned out.  Horses are used to just being bothered.  This whole time, by the way, the veterinarian is squeezing shit out.  It's just pouring out.  Now I think Jimmy's correct. 
[00:26:00]  I think we're pushing close to a gallon.  Sure.  A gallon of pus coming out of this horse.  Well, the horse is like.  World's largest pimple.  Well, you know what it is?  He's got fucking hooves, so the horse can't do it.  The horse is like, I run fast, but look at all these things I can't do, and he holds  his hooves up.  Right.  I can't even puke for Pete's sake.  I'm still doing a horse buggy bumper sticker.  Oh, the assistant's finally back.  He gave up on this for a while.  I think he had a problem.  He's back with the water.  How much more is left in this video?  Four hours. 
[00:26:30]  All right.  We're about to.  Yeah, that's pretty gross.  They got it.  I know it's a cheap plug, but I tweeted that really late last night, and we'll put it on  our Facebook page as well.  So, it's called the world's, what is it?  Biggest Horse Pimple.  Biggest Horse Pimple.  You've never seen that with horses, is it?  No, I've seen some sick shit with horses.  Like what?  Well, you've seen dead horses.  Well, yeah, but the most disturbing thing I ever saw was one of these stables.  Everybody used to make their own dumb hitching posts. 
[00:27:00]  Most of them were made with wood.  You get a couple of telephone pole-like things and put them in the ground, and then you take  another big, long piece of telephone pole and put it across the top, bracket it on there,  and you tie your horses up.  Well, somebody decided to make it out of the regular galvanized steel that you would use  for fence posts and whatnot, like chain-link fence.  Okay.  And he left about two feet hanging over the edges. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, my God.  On either side.  The horse got spooked.  He pulled his head one way and then whipped it the other way, and the fucking fence thing  went right through his neck.  Right into his neck.  He was hung up on the thing.  Like, and blood was fucking flying out of this horse's neck.  Dead?  Flying.  No.  No.  They had a vet that was actually there doing some shit with other horses and was able to  save him, but he like, it was all fucked up.  Like, you know how horses got those big cheek things on the back side of their head? 
[00:28:00]  It's like that roundy, flatty part.  That, like, was cracked.  Oh, my God.  Like, it just, it went right through there and back into the, it was so, like, I think  kids are still traumatized.  Uh, you know, now they're just men and they're, they remember that and are traumatized.  Oh, my God.  And on me, I thought it was pretty fucking, uh, sick, but at least it wasn't my horse.  I don't care.  We got Dr. Steve calling in about the horse.  Oh, great.  I wonder what that smell is. 
[00:28:30]  Dr. Steve.  Yes.  Good morning, gentlemen.  That is called an equine abscess.  Oh.  Oh, really, Dr. Steve?  Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  And by the way, a horse fluid makes a wonderful merlot.  Horse fluid.  An equine abscess, yeah.  An equine abscess.  Equine abscess.  It's a bill of dirt.  Another guy saying, uh, this happens to cows a lot.  Let me just, uh, go to Carl.  Carl. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, comment.  Gentlemen, how you doing?  All right, Carl.  What do you got on this?  Um, yeah, I used to be a dairy farmer and, uh, we had a cow right out of the couch.  And cut a tip on a, uh, on a bar.  And over the next few days, it just sort of got worse and worse.  And it ended up being exactly like that.  It got to the stage where the bone was sticking through the skin.  And we would just pump it full of iodine.  And the smell was...  Odine.  But, no, I'm not Australian.  I'm New Zealand.  You had a weird Jersey accent. 
[00:29:30]  Pump it through.  Odine.  It's an odine.  I think Toss is the same accent, though.  It's the same goddamn accent.  I want to go to New Zealand.  I hear it's amazing.  What?  No, I know.  Dylan's way better than Australian.  You don't go up at the end?  Cook the man some eggs.  No, we don't go up at the end.  Hey, Jimmy, I loved you on Irvine, by the way.  On what?  I saw Jimmy in Irvine.  Oh, Irvine.  Thank you.  Irvine.  Thank you.  You see how we slowed down that word so we understood?  Irvine.  I saw Jimmy in Irvine.  Thank you very much. 
[00:30:00]  Irvine.  Thank you.  That was a tough one. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  I didn't understand you.  You said something about Uncle Fucking Bully.  And Wool.  And Gracie.  I love Once the Warriors.  There's actually a documentary about the Mary.  There is a documentary about the Mary?  That is a documentary about Mary.  Oh, wow.  Once the Warriors.  All right.  I love that.  I have the book.  I haven't read it yet.  That's awesome.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Thank you to see you, man.  Bye.  All right.  Thank you.  It's kind of fun to listen to that accent, isn't it?  Yeah, it really is.  Let's verify age. 
[00:31:00]  Fuck.  A guy sent me one that, he says it's bigger on a cow.  Another pimple.  Oh, God.  Yesterday was Hula Hoop videos.  Today is fucking...  Oh, man.  I like Hula Hoop videos better.  Animal...  Yeah.  Pimples.  Animal infections.  I prefer a Hula Hoop video myself.  Go to WebDevPHP on Twitter there, Sam, to find that.  WebDevDevPHP.  I did see a nice one yesterday about some fucking, I guess, a Taliban guy setting off mortars. 
[00:31:30]  Really?  And he just gets fucking smoked.  He's going, Allah, Allah, Allah.  And his buddy filming it is yelling it.  And they're just yelling it.  Boonk, boonk.  He's setting off mortars.  And then the whole fucking area he's in just explodes.  They said, fucking, he blows up.  Wow.  Yeah, apparently they fired a mortar back at him.  Oh, really?  And just blew his ass up.  They figured where he was, huh? 
[00:32:00]  Allah, Allah, Allah.  It's a tremendously disturbing sound.  It's never said at good times in videos.  No, no.  It's not like Mazel Tov.  Yeah.  Or something.  It's just horrible things are happening.  It's the he's a jolly good fellow of decapitations.  That's funny, man.  Can we see this cow thing?  Now this asshole on Twitter peaked our interest. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, shit.  Jesus, Jimmy.  It's good.  That's so fucking good.  Oh, shit.  Are you using that one on the stage yet?  No, but I might have to write that one down.  Not to tell you what to do.  Thank you, but I think some audiences would appreciate that one.  No, Sam, you're not watching?  Nope.  All right, the guy.  Oh!  I'm not watching.  All right, this one's rough.  Wow.  This one's rough.  It's the upper hind leg of the cow.  And how big is that one?  That thing is. 
[00:33:00]  How do you describe it?  It's the size of a medicine ball.  Yeah.  And the guy just stabbed it with a knife.  And now it's pouring out.  Oh, God.  It's pouring out like a box of wine if you just fucking let it flow.  It kind of looks like a box of wine.  It kind of looks like what Judy used to drink.  Ah!  I like a nice glass of cow bus.  It looks like a light Zinfandel.  What do they call that?  A pet?  What the fuck is the light Zinfandel called?  Oh. 
[00:33:30]  With a blush?  A blush.  Oh, a blush.  By the way, the guy poked him with the knife, what, about 40 seconds ago, and it's still  flowing with no sign of slowing down.  Oh, you can even hear it.  You can even hear it.  Stop.  That's puss pouring out?  Yes.  You're not looking?  No.  You can even hear it.  It's not as gross, though.  Holy fuck!  It's pouring out of him!  You gotta look, Sam.  You gotta support other people's videos.  We support yours.  Yeah, why aren't you supporting other people's videos?  Come on, look. 
[00:34:00]  That's the key to YouTube.  You gotta support others.  It ain't that bad.  It looks like strawberry milk.  The guy just...  It's just...  I wish I could come like that.  Imagine if it got into the fucking milk thing, and you got a carton of milk and just poured  it on your cereal, not knowing it was cow leg pus, and it gets a little lumpy.  Oh.  The flow is not even slowing down.  Oh.  How long is the video?  It's like egg beaters coming out of his leg.  Oh, that cow is not happy to have his leg touch. 
[00:34:30]  It's been worn out for over two minutes.  It's slowing down a little bit, but not much.  It's shrunk a lot.  Poor cow.  Holy fuck.  Can we put this on the Facebook page?  Because they're so dumb, they don't understand what's happening.  The cow doesn't understand this is helping him or her.  Yeah, that's why I'm doing it.  Yeah, but the cow is just, is not bothered by it.  We try to touch it, the cow lifted his leg like, hey, what the hay?  And now, it's like the end of your pee at this point, guys.  It's kind of slowing down.  I hate this stuff. 
[00:35:00]  You really hate this stuff?  I hate it.  Why?  He's squeezing it.  It's just fluids.  Don't you think it's fascinating?  I don't like fluids.  Fluids.  Fluids.  Yeah.  You don't think this is fascinating?  No, it's just disgusting.  Now he's squeezing it like he's trying to get the last of the wine out.  To the last drop.  And the cow is not pleased.  The cow is none too pleased with this activity.  Cows aren't happy with anything humans do to them.  Well, can they be?  They just want to stand there at a bell and have their fucking tits milked.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  The life of a cow. 
[00:35:30]  Ring-a-ding.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Wow.  That was pretty impressive.  That's disgusting.  That was impressive.  God damn it.  So the refs are coming back.  If you're just tuning in.  Yeah.  Tonight.  Who's playing tonight?  I don't even know who's playing tonight.  Does anyone know?  Ravens and Browns.  Ravens and Browns.  Okay.  And remember Belichick grabbing the ref at the end of that field goal?  Oh, yes.  End of the game, actually, but with that winning field goal that some say was absolutely a bit 
[00:36:00]  wide right.  Slightly wide right, I guess.  Find?  50 G's.  50 large.  For a quick grab of the ref to try to talk to him.  50 G's.  That cost him.  That's a lot of moolah.  It sure is.  Damn.  Damn.  Wasn't that the Helmsley thing?  50 G's.  50 G's.  Yeah.  He just gives away Sherman Helmsley's estate for touching a ref.  Right.  Puts it in perspective.  Yeah.  And NFL players who trash replacement refs on Twitter reportedly will not be fined. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, there you go.  So it looks like the NFL doing the right thing with that one.  That's kind of cool.  Sure.  But they're not admitting they made a mistake.  Of course not.  That's bad.  Right.  Stupid assholes in football.  Exactly.  You know, we don't do birthdays often, but you know whose birthday it is today, Iraq?  Oh, come on, guys.  For real?  Uh-oh.  Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio, with two very bad knees.  What was this?  I never heard this clip.  No. 
[00:37:00]  What's it?  What's it?  In a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  Oh.  Oh, that's sweet.  Guy probably never made it, though.  No.  That's a shame.  I think God, the dream came true.  Oh, it did come true.  Nice.  Reggie Jackson.  Fucking Mike Schmidt is 63 years old.  My God, man.  63.  Wow.  Now, a few people tweeted me about another athlete crying, saying it's way better than  Mike Schmidt.  No way.  You want to watch it cold? 
[00:37:30]  Because I swear I have not seen it.  As long as he doesn't have pus coming out of him, I'll watch.  Derek Rose, who's rehabbing, he's one of the stars in the NBA there, and I think he  was launching a new fucking shoe, and he was talking about the fans, and he got all  choked up.  And people are saying this video is really fucking good.  Right.  The hell?  Michonne is...  I'm all in.  You know, I know it's emotional, but you just have to understand.  The video starts with him. 
[00:38:00]  He's not even looking.  He's looking at some kind of press conference for, I guess, his new shoe from Adidas, and  his head is completely down.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to look at anyone.  He's really emotional, because his new shoe drops, but this guy isn't playing anytime soon  still.  Wait, why isn't he playing?  He had a fucking bad knee injury.  I think it was a year of rehab he was looking at, I believe.  One bad knee.  What the fuck?  He doesn't even fucking...  So wait, Derek Rose plays for who?  The Bulls.  He's literally one of the best players in the fucking league. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, he's a great player?  Yeah, he's right up there.  Is he coming back?  Eventually.  I don't know where his rehab's at, but he had this horrendous injury, and they said it  would take about a year of intense rehab to get back.  Okay.  So I think that means he's going to miss a lot of this year as well.  So his shoe is out.  Someone who knows more could maybe fill in the details, but that's the basics of this.  So he's at the press conference for his new shoe, Adidas, and he can't even look at the  fucking crowd, and he gets really emotional.  You're inspiring millions of fans in your comeback, but the purpose of the return goes both ways 
[00:39:00]  because they're inspiring you.  Whether it's communicating to you on Facebook or Twitter or millions and millions of hits  on your videos, you know, inspiration goes both ways.  So maybe you can tell us a little bit about the inspiration that you're getting from your  fans.  Oh, boy.  This isn't going to work out well.  Oh, no.  Head's still down.  He looks like Jesse Miss Kelly during the murder trial in Memphis. 
[00:39:30]  He's looking up, wiping his eyes, looking back down.  He still can't talk.  He's trying to get it together.  They hand him tissues.  Wow, this is good.  Jesus Christ.  He's blubbering.  Son of a bitch.  Pissy-eyed.  It's truly a blessing, man.  Well, with all this stuff that's going on in this city, a kid from Inglewood got something 
[00:40:00]  positive going on.  HIV.  Yeah.  Who's the kid?  That makes me feel so good, man.  Well, this, this shoe is great.  This is, oh, this is great, but it's, I can't explain this.  I can't.  You don't have to tell us you can't explain it.  I don't know what the fuck you're pissy-eyed about.  I went through so much. 
[00:40:30]  To have, like, true fans, that means a lot to me, and I know it means a lot to my family.  Because we aren't supposed to be here at all, but God made a way.  Oh, baby.  Yeah.  This is truly unreal, man.  He's a great public speaker, though.  I'm just happy that I have true players out there. 
[00:41:00]  Well, you do, first of all, and this is one of the reasons why you do.  Wow.  All right.  Who said it's better?  Yeah.  It's not better.  I mean, he's very emotional, but it's not.  Yeah, no.  It's not that bad.  He held it together.  They're always like, I got a better clip.  It's always better, right?  Oh, and it's never better.  It's good to watch, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you're right.  You're absolutely right.  Mike Schmidt is by far the best one ever. 
[00:41:30]  The best.  From 18 years ago, I met Dave McHale with two very bad knees.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  I thank God the dream came true.  Okay.  OMG.  Oh, yeah.  John Montone.  Although the wrestling guy is a close second. 
[00:42:00]  That is a great one.  That's a close second.  You know, it's still real to him.  Yeah.  What's our top five?  You got the Mike Schmidt.  You got the wrestling kid.  Oh, God.  Who else is on the list?  I love that guy.  You know what?  We might have to knock Mike Schmidt out of the top fucking spot.  That one is so good.  I forgot about that one.  From Intervention.  And the video, his face, when he does that, is classic. 
[00:42:30]  It is one of the greatest clips ever.  That might be number one on the wrestling.  That is a fucking great one.  That's a doozy.  Dice, you put yourself out there, is pretty good.  You put yourself out there.  On Arsenio.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Oh, top five crying clips.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would say definitely those two.  Best cry ever.  Mike Schmidt, wrestling dude.  Still real to me.  Yeah.  And then we got two spots.  Possibly Dice in there.  Yeah.  This one wasn't on video, but Eton Pates. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, Jesus.  That is just an evil soul.  I don't mind that he's evil.  I mind the fact that he can't find a molestation after 1979.  Did you see what they're fucking serving in the Middle East?  Could someone grab this?  Contractor head.  They're fucking up the pizza over there in the Middle East,  and they're not bringing it to the Pizza Huts over here yet.  Oh, no. 
[00:43:30]  They got like a crown crust with, oh, wait.  We can maybe just play this.  Go around the crust filled, you heard it there,  with cream cheese and honey-baseded chicken.  Honey-based.  Not the first time the chain is getting innovated with its crust.  This one is much worse, actually.  This is the Golden Crown Cheeseburger Pizza Pizza Hut.  Pizza-sized slab of dough with mini cheeseburgers baked into the crust.  No.  Yes.  The burgers create a crown, you see,  encircling a bed of toppings and special sauce.  Are they required to post a calorie count? 
[00:44:00]  Is it in the Middle East?  Mayor Bloomberg hasn't made it there yet.  It says Iraq on travelosity.  One would think so.  I like the honey-based.  Did you get a trip to the ER?  And for dessert, wait, there's more.  Dessert, breadsticks called Kit Kat Pops,  a mini version of the chocolate wafer candy,  nestled inside a breadstick and topped with cinnamon sugar.  See, that's not so great.  It's what Tarekka made that.  It's what Tarekka made that.  It's what Tarekka made that.  They don't care.  I was telling Travis, like,  I could maybe have a couple bites of that shit. 
[00:44:30]  I couldn't eat a whole meal like that.  No.  I'd like to try it, of course.  No fucking way.  You see the pizza?  It comes with probably,  I'm trying to figure out,  probably 10 to 12 cheeseburgers as your crust.  Yeah.  There's no need for that.  There's no need for that.  Cheeseburgers as the crust of a pizza.  That's fucking crazy.  It's amazing.  Jesus, man.  We should have invented that.  That should be in America first.  Nowhere else.  You're right.  Did we talk about the mashed potato machine?  I think when it first came. 
[00:45:00]  It looks like the pasta was coming out of the fucking casa.  Thank you.  Nice, Chris.  That looks delicious.  Where it dispenses mashed potatoes.  Mashed potatoes.  And the pizza making machine.  Yeah, we looked at both of those.  Oh, we did.  It makes it for you instantly.  Yeah, I wasn't sure.  I guess we could eat then, right?  We got a lot of guests today.  Maybe we could talk about the University of California  Occupy protesters getting a million dollars  because of that pepper spraying video.  Really?  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  That'd be a million dollars. 
[00:45:30]  We'll talk about that next.  Fucking the lotto states of America.  Yeah.  Can we talk about the fecal transplant story?  Sure.  It's a big story.  It is, yeah.  Fecal.  Have you heard about this one?  Ah, fecal.  Yeah, fecal transplant.  Ah, my hair plugs weren't taking,  so they did a fecal transplant.  Fecal.  And it's when they opened up my head  and they filled it with cow feces.  We might have to have Dr. Steve on standby for that story.  And then we got to talk about this fucking plane  and the landing gear.  Holy shit. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, that's a clip that's making the rounds.  We got Matt Paxton from Hoarders today.  Hoarders?  Yeah.  He was great last time.  Yes, he's a great cast.  Good guy.  New season of Hoarders, I guess, has begun.  Yes.  On that show.  And then, I don't know how to say his name.  Dinesh.  Eliza Schlesinger.  No, yeah, I know that one.  Oh, and then.  A funny comic, obviously.  Dinesh D'Souza.  And Dinesh D'Souza, that's how you say it?  Yeah.  At 8 o'clock.  He's the one that made the film on Obama.  2016.  That propaganda film.  Well, some people call it that. 
[00:46:30]  I think, you know, me and Jimmy were talking before.  He does speculate in it,  but I don't see how a lot of his speculation could be off base.  I mean, he speculated about a lot of things.  And then there's some cold, hard facts in there, too.  Sure.  I saw the movie.  I liked it.  You know.  I'm blocking my first guy on Twitter ever.  Oh.  I finally have to start blocking people.  Oh, really?  Yeah, finally.  This is my first one.  The guy actually writes,  Enough of the Mike Schmidt already. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, okay.  Go listen to something else, you dumbbell.  It's from 18 years ago.  I left Dayton, Ohio.  With two very bad knees.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  I thank God the dream came true.  This is the movie Anthony Show.  On an all-new hoarders. 
[00:47:30]  A Long Island mansion on the brink of quarantine.  And one Italian millionaire who can't let go.  I have seven or 14 disabilities.  Anthony used to have a life until hoarding took over his existence.  This is my stuff.  I'm a collector.  I'm not a hoarder.  What do you want me to do?  You're saying that me?  I am not a good parent?  Dr. Robin tries to bring Anthony back and help him cope with the reality of the situation. 
[00:48:00]  Anthony, your gun closet.  Do you see what's on your gun closet?  There's roaches everywhere.  This isn't good for you, Anthony.  How do you even store food in this environment?  The refrigerator has roaches all inside it.  It doesn't work.  These conditions, they're not livable.  How could you have let it get this bad?  I've Epstein-Barr.  That young girlfriend of yours moved out?  Danny doesn't even come over anymore.  Oh, they didn't care.  No.  Oh my God.  What's that?  Doctor, we found a skeleton. 
[00:48:30]  Is that a...  And then my dog died.  There's roaches in the movie theater, a karaoke stage filled with rats, raccoons crawling over child pornography.  It's like a carnival of garbage.  All on the next...  Orders.  Coming this fall, Daytime TV is back with a bite.  Hell yeah.  Spend your weekday afternoons laughing, loving, and learning with Mike.  I'm not going to say anything about the vagina. 
[00:49:00]  Heavyweight champion of the world, Mike Tyson, leaves the ring behind and hosts his own daytime TV show, giving dating advice.  That's how it is.  Everybody know.  You stick with your ex, even though you break up, till you find somebody whose sex is better or just as good.  Sharing personal experiences.  Don Keenan, give me my padeem.  I couldn't eat, motherfucker.  I'm going to beat you a grown man.  I ain't eat, motherfucker.  Fuck you, nigga.  And getting a little rowdy with the studio audience.  Fuck you!  Fucking do it!  Yeah!  Mike lets the audience in on his more reserved, well-read side. 
[00:49:30]  Yes, sir.  My addiction's too precarious for your comprehension.  I will endeavor to exclaminate more profoundly.  Yes, ma'am.  But he isn't afraid to let loose now and then, too.  Booga, booga, booga!  Booga, booga!  Weekday afternoons this fall.  It's Mike.  Hosted by Mike Tyson.  What do you say, champ?  What?  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  There's a lot to get to before all our guests start showing up. 
[00:50:00]  Start pouring in.  Start pouring in.  Yes.  I saw a couple episodes of Walking Dead.  Oh, nice.  From the new season.  And?  How'd you see that?  I'm good like that.  What the fuck is that shit?  Yes, yes.  You were too busy getting a picture with Carol Burnett. 
[00:50:30]  Yes, I was.  You weren't paying attention.  You got to know somebody named Rolando.  Hey, Rolando.  What are we?  Can I see it, too?  Rolando.  Rolando.  It, yeah.  No spoilers, but there's zombies.  There's zombies in this show?  Amazing.  Zombies.  Nice.  And they shoot them in the head.  Yeah.  They shoot zombies in the head.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Good start.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:51:00]  Pretty good.  A couple of those surprises where you're like, oh, whoa, no way.  They fucking didn't do that.  I'm waiting for my Breaking Bad DVDs.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I decided to watch this show that everyone's talking about.  Breaking Bad.  It's good.  Yeah.  You got to have a little festival at your house.  Watch them all.  A little marathon?  Yeah, a marathon.  I like that.  A marathon.  And then, yeah, you'll be all caught up for when the next season starts in five years,  I think, is when it's coming back.  Oh, is it that long?  No, I have no idea how long. 
[00:51:30]  That was the beauty of The Wire, man.  I didn't need to have to wait for any of it.  Isn't that great?  I went from season to season, man.  When you miss an entire series of something and discover it later on, you're just like,  I'd do it on my time.  I remember laughing to myself because I would see the season finale of, let's say, season  one.  And then I just popped in the next, you know.  Meant nothing.  The next season.  And I thought to myself at the time, like, people ought to wait a year for what I just  did.  And they were so like, oh my God, what just happened?  To me, it's just another episode. 
[00:52:00]  Pop in the next one.  It's a good feeling.  I watched a couple episodes of, like, a couple seasons of True Blood.  And it's good.  I mean, it's not my favorite show, but it's decent.  There's some interesting points to it.  But a couple of the season endings, I'm like, wow.  That was a pretty good ending.  Like, they have some great moments on the show.  And I'm like, wow, people have to wait a year to see what happened here.  No, it's not.  Fuck.  Easy.  That's ridiculous.  All right.  So we got three choices here.  Oh.  We got the sideways landing gear story. 
[00:52:30]  Another one of those.  We got the fecal transplants or the mystery box.  Mystery box.  Ooh, that's called a blind date.  Which is another video that I dare say was a bit hot in the untraditional way.  No pus, right?  No.  Tired of the pus.  No.  Your choice.  Well.  Although the mystery box thing, it might take a little time to find the video. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Oh, because Sam Roberts was going to talk about this today.  I bet if you mentioned Sam's video to him, he'd have that up there in two seconds.  Oh, shit.  He would.  Not like trying to fucking find a video of anything else.  Oh, there it is.  See?  Wow.  Just like that.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  The video's slowing down.  Uh-oh.  No more views.  Look at the dislikes growing.  There's a video of a nurse doing a little something something.  Oh, no.  Not an enema.  Did you see this video yet?  Is it an enema? 
[00:53:30]  It's not on YouTube, sir.  I'm sorry.  It's not on YouTube.  That could not possibly be hot.  Huh?  This video, it was sort of a turn-on in a weird fucking way, man.  None of that stuff does anything for me.  Could someone retweet that shit to me?  Someone out there knows what I'm talking about.  I find it weird and, like, bizarre to watch, but, like, with anything else.  You want me to explain the video?  But it's, uh...  To keep the people? 
[00:54:00]  All right.  What is it?  It looks like it's, uh, you know, like, a surveillance cam.  Oh, of course.  Okay.  You see a nurse, but you don't see her head.  Headless nurse.  And there's a guy severely disabled in a wheelchair, and she is jerking him off.  Oh, she's milking him.  Is that what it is?  I'm not going to lie to you in a really weird way.  I was like... 
[00:54:30]  Oh, no.  How...  Is that it?  Yes.  Look at this.  Oh, my God.  He's fucking freaking out.  He's one of those guys that has, like, a hockey helmet on.  Dude, he's got a stick on it so he can communicate.  Right.  Unless this is all bullshit.  He's got restraints on.  I don't know.  He's doing a pretty good acting job.  And there's no...  Her face is not in it.  And her face is not in it, and she's...  And she's, uh...  She's probably tired of his fucking hijinks and shenanigans. 
[00:55:00]  She's got gloves on, and she's just working it.  She's got a towel there all ready to go.  He's a big pud.  He's got a big pud.  He's a pud.  That's where all the blood goes, since it's not bothering his legs.  We found this video on Handjob Hub, by the way.  Handjob Hub?  Handjob Hub.  Who knew there was a Handjob Hub?  Well, the Handjob is making a huge comeback, Anthony.  Oh, it really is.  Is there a money shot for the poor fella?  I'll be honest.  I didn't go to the entrance.  Oh.  Then I was like, okay. 
[00:55:30]  She's playing around with his nutsack there.  You think...  Yeah, I don't think you could act like that guy.  I don't think you could act like how that guy's moving.  He doesn't know what's going on.  He's so confused.  What's she going for?  Oh, a little lube.  She went for the lube.  A little more lotion.  And now she's really working it.  Very vigorous tug job happening here.  Jimmy, turn on in a way or not, really?  Nah, I mean, the Handjob, yeah, but the guy just sitting there in a fucking chair. 
[00:56:00]  He was probably, like, yapping the whole time.  Oh, it looks Asian.  That might be real, actually.  It looks Asian.  Probably yapping the whole time, just annoying everybody.  And she's like, ah, jack him off.  He goes to sleep.  Someone wrote that it's a nurse.  Maybe it's not a nurse.  Maybe, you know, somebody said, you know what?  Fuck this.  We got to take care of our pal.  Our pal?  You know?  Yeah, she's got the surgical gloves on.  That always makes for a nice romantic evening.  She's all in, though.  Did she?  Oh, is that it?  I don't know.  Is that it?  I think I think...  Yeah, she's cleaning up.  All right, all right. 
[00:56:30]  Hey, happy new year there, fella.  There you go.  She's wrapping it up.  There you go.  She's wrapping it up all nice.  Handjob hub.  What else is on handjob hubs?  What happened to the intratubes over the years?  What?  They're just specialized now.  Cam was real.  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  That guy was pretty well-endowed.  You mean we could actually talk to that girl right now that's talking?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you're just looking at a website, and out of nowhere, you're just looking at videos 
[00:57:00]  or pictures or something, and then out of nowhere, you hear, you want me to give it  to you?  Oh, it's the worst.  You got to look through 18 fucking browsers.  They're smart, though, because they opened it up smaller behind your window.  Yeah.  Right.  I don't know where it's coming from.  Oh, my God.  Come bus Lily.  Wow, this guy.  In the upper right here corner.  Holy shit.  Where's come bus Lily?  Hi, Lily.  Don't you think that's impossible?  It's fake.  That's fake.  How do they fake that?  Oh, that one might be real.  Because there's some of them where you can see where they never show the dick touching  the body, so the cocks are fake. 
[00:57:30]  Some of them.  This guy's real, but.  Wow.  And then what?  They have, like, a pump dispenser to make it look like way more than a guy could do?  Yeah, this might be real.  Or it might be from the side.  That's ridiculous.  Is it from the side?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Might probably be fake.  All right.  Yeah, it's fake.  Anyway.  I've seen some big fucking loads.  Like, I may or may not have shot one yesterday that hit myself in the head.  Oh, shit.  That's pretty impressive.  Top of my head and behind me on the bed.  He was doing a headstand, though. 
[00:58:00]  Blurka, blurka.  Dripping down like a Chinese water torture.  Oh.  What?  All right.  So we got this plane coming in at JFK.  Holy shit.  Yeah, what happened here?  We're calling it the hand of God.  You want the news story?  Hand of God.  The hand of God, the one that didn't fix it before it took off?  Yeah, really.  Thanks.  Talk about a scare in the air.  Hundreds of passengers aboard a jumbo jet from Rio de Janeiro endure a frightening landing 
[00:58:30]  at Kennedy Airport.  It's a story we first broke on Seven Online.  Oh.  Only News Captain Seven was able to catch the landing.  Who cares?  Give a fuck.  The jet's nose gear got stuck sideways, but it straightened out as the plane touched down.  We also obtained exclusive video of the precarious landing from the ground.  Federal investigators now trying to figure out what caused the landing gear to malfunction.  Nobody was hurt.  Oh.  Yeah, it's just a tire was crooked or some shit.  And then it straightened out when they landed, so it wasn't even like that guy that, you know, 
[00:59:00]  that one of these landed once before with the sideways nose gear.  Was that the JetBlue flight?  Yeah, and it just like ground it down to nothing.  What was that?  Yeah, okay.  This guy had nothing, no problem.  You lived through those.  I mean, I don't know, man.  That's crazy.  It's scary and it's probably really loud, but.  It ain't like the fuselage coming apart at 35,000.  They had had their doubts.  The Airbus circling twice as the tower continued to check the nose gear.  Never want to circle twice, never.  That's what you know.  Fuck, something's up.  Tower mechanical so forth, 9-0-7-8, it's the northern landing gear. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, no, that's the pilot.  M-8-0-7-8, heavy, it does not appear to be normal.  Thank you very much, 9-0-7-8.  Abroad.  M-8-0-7-8 appears cocked at 90 degrees.  Cocked.  The Airbus was diverted to JFK's longest runway, 3-1 left, which is more than 14,000 feet long.  Emergency crews stood by on the ground.  This is exclusive video as the plane landed safely.  You can see the first responders approaching. 
[01:00:00]  8-0-7-8, heavy, it appears as you were landing, the nose gear hits straightened out, and you can stop whenever you like.  Obviously, it's straightened out if they're not going to do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.  It worked out.  You are going to have quite a story to tell later on.  No, you won't.  This was the first flight for Anna Maria Falco's one-year-old son.  She was so worried it might be his last.  It's a non-story.  It's a non-story.  And then the news has to find the worst-case scenario. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, a kid who never even got to live his life.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  You're going to have a great story.  Right.  Hey, everybody at the party, turn the music off.  What happened?  We're on a plane, right?  Turn the music off.  All right, hold on.  He's on a plane.  What happened?  We're coming in.  And we circled twice.  Wow.  And then we landed.  Holy shit, really?  But once we landed, they said that the landing gear was crooked, but then straightened out.  So what did you feel on the plane when it landed?  Normal landing. 
[01:01:00]  But afterwards in the terminals when it got scary because we had circled twice.  Oh, right, right.  You had said that already.  And they told me that what could have happened was it could have been like, but no, no, no,  it wasn't like that.  Oh, it didn't?  It straightened out.  Oh, wow.  So nothing.  No, but two circles around the airport, not one.  Boom.  Second time around, we're all going, all right, what the fuck? 
[01:01:30]  Sounds harrowing.  And we come in and we're like, all right, cool.  Land's fine.  But they told us later what could have happened.  Yeah, what could have, but didn't.  Yeah.  Fucking horrible news.  Can we see how she ends this story, the dumb reporter from Channel 7?  She's been around forever.  Well, they have exclusive videos.  Exclusive.  It's important to say that they have exclusive.  You won't see anywhere else.  Yeah, because it's a non-story.  I want to see how she wraps this up.  Yes.  Very curious about this.  We want to take a taxi to go to Brazil because...  No one cares.  We don't want to take a plane again. 
[01:02:00]  You can kind of imagine that feeling today.  By the way, federal investigators are now on the scene trying to determine what went wrong.  Are they?  I thought they would just say, eh, forget it.  Live from Kennedy Airport, Sarah Wallace, Channel 7.  Yeah, this is Sarah.  Sarah, a total non-story.  A waste of everybody's time.  You never know where her eyes are looking.  Yeah.  Sarah's a fool.  Sarah is a fool.  I bet none of the other stations covered it.  No?  Just because they didn't have the exclusive video.  Like Channel 7.  We're not selling this video. 
[01:02:30]  Wow.  Did you hear?  I think it's Channel 11 here in New York.  They're part of that whole cable thing where their channel's not being shown or something.  Oh, really?  And no one cares.  And they're writing stories and blogging about, uh-oh, is local news dead?  No, it's been dead.  Because there's no outrage that...  I think it's Channel 11.  It is.  It is?  Yeah, it's on Cablevision.  I didn't even realize it was still happening.  And they were expecting...  They were going to do this thing, and they expected, like, all right, everyone will be outraged.  Oh, the clamor, yeah.  And it turns out no one noticed that they went away. 
[01:03:00]  Who watches local fucking news anymore?  I mean, when was the last time you actually sat down and watched local news?  I watch every day.  No way.  Not to be informed.  Oh, yeah, to be goofed on it?  It's entertaining as all hell, because it's so stupid.  Local news is useless.  Where the weather guy spends five minutes telling you something you can find on an app in five seconds.  They tease sports scores, where you're like, if you're a fan of the sport or the team, you already know who won.  You already know.  And they just can't figure out another way to do this still. 
[01:03:30]  It amazes me.  It is a huge waste of time and energy.  And local news.  And now you can peek in.  I think it's Channel 7.  It's in our neighborhood.  They do the glass fucking windows so you can look in.  Oh, right.  And every once in a while, if I'm walking around the neighborhood, right around five or six, I'll take a peek.  The whole time, all they do is fucking work on their makeup, their hair, and everything else.  They don't even, they're not even, like, looking at the stories. 
[01:04:00]  It scrolls right in front of them.  They don't care.  No, but they're just working on their makeup constantly.  They got mirrors.  As soon as they go to break, they all pick up their mirrors.  That's the most important part.  That's the most important part, right?  Local news.  Oh, I watch every day just a little bit.  But we keep you connected with your area.  Yeah, shut up.  No, you really don't.  Not anymore.  It's useless.  Even the older folk, I don't think, you know, are getting their news from local news.  They got to be the only ones even barely watching that.  You got to be really old at this point, right? 
[01:04:30]  Oh, my God.  Because it's really hip to have a smartphone in the older generations.  The jitterbug.  I have my jitterbug with the large numbers so I don't misdial.  And it says it's a flip phone.  A flip phone with buttons.  That giant 911 button.  I was thinking what a genius move that Life Alert was the other day.  Oh, yeah?  Like, we don't need them around.  But I'm not saying it's not.  It's called the burden extender. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  But what a brilliant thing.  Just press a button and the ambulance shows up.  I pressed my Life Alert button that my son David got me.  And help was on the way.  And the garage door opened.  David has a big inheritance coming.  So he didn't want me futzing it up.  He says, Mother, just lay there.  They'll be bought for you shortly.  And the garage door went up.  The channels are changing on the television.  Why is it genius?  Because it's just a one-button thing. 
[01:05:30]  Like, no matter where you are in the house, you don't have to get to the phone.  So if you fall or whatever, you just hit the button and they show up.  It's just a pretty brilliant...  I've fallen.  And I can't get up.  I can't get up.  That was a famous commercial.  Can I tell you, comedians...  Can we find that commercial?  My God.  The original.  Comedians went ballistic on that.  Didn't they?  We could go back to this.  What's the John Liu clip?  This is the asshole that got...  JV and Elvis fired.  JV and Elvis fired.  And it turns out this guy's pretty fucking dirty.  Real.  This guy's fucking dirty, man. 
[01:06:00]  There's some shit going on with this guy.  He's talking about the cable vision blackout.  Oh, he is.  All right.  Because there's been some things, some stories written about him and his staff, this John  Liu.  I haven't forgotten.  John Liu.  Getting radio guys fired for doing Asian accents.  Really?  When one of the guys was married to an Asian.  That makes sense.  Now, what are we doing?  The life call thing.  I just remember these commercials.  I forget what year it was.  Oh, in 89.  I was going to guess. 
[01:06:30]  Okay, yeah.  Spend time alone.  I may have died if I hadn't been wearing it.  I'm alive today because of it.  No, you're not.  Not anymore.  It saved my life.  You're dead, too.  If you spend time alone and worry about how you get help if you fell at a medical emergency  or accident, protect yourself the way these people do.  It's the greatest.  With Life Call, the 24-hour emergency response service.  Simply by pressing this button, you can instantly summon an ambulance, your doctor, your family,  even your next-door neighbor, all without picking up the phone. 
[01:07:00]  Just press this button, speak into the air.  I've fallen and I can't get up.  But that's not the original one.  No, the original one was right down the steps.  I've fallen and I can't get up.  Please find the one of the old lady falling down the steps.  Original fallen but can't get up.  Yeah.  Maybe that'll do it.  Ah.  Yeah, yeah.  They've had others, imitators, but never the greatest.  I've fallen and I can't get up.  In home accidents last year, over 3 million people have disabled. 
[01:07:30]  Pause, please.  Pause this.  What a great fall.  Oh, she takes a fucking spill.  This old gray-haired bitty.  You think they sacrificed one broad to make the commercial?  Because that doesn't look like a stuntman.  I know.  It really looks like someone might have pushed her.  You know what, they told her it was a carpeting commercial and that she has to walk down  the steps and then the fucking AD just shoves her.  You can't tell that's a stuntman and it's just a dumb commercial. 
[01:08:00]  No, there's probably a fucking...  Let me see.  Oh, that's phenomenal.  Wow, you really can't tell.  There's twine in the fucking thing.  They just tripped her.  You old hag.  Go slow.  I'm going to see if you can tell this is a stuntman.  Well, they do a jump cut, I think.  Yeah, they do.  Dude, absolutely the jump cut to the stuntman, but there.  There it is.  Let's see.  It's got a mustache, I think.  It's hard to tell.  Yeah.  Wow, that's a pretty impressive fall down the stairs.  And then they cut to her just rolling to the bottom of the stairs. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  And then the famous line, I think.  A thousand either suffered permanent disabilities or died.  There is no second chance when help arrives...  Oh, my God.  She's dead.  She's dead.  The guy's sick is dead.  It can be as close as a tiny radio transmitter you wear around your neck.  There's a lady laying in the toilet grabbing her hip.  When you're alone and can't get to the phone, it takes just of this button seconds to alert  the life call 24-hour monitoring center.  Nice computer. 
[01:09:00]  I don't think this one's in either.  Fuck.  There is no second chance when help arrives too late.  That's a great one.  You want to hear...  The doctor put the stethoscope to her back, and then she's laying on the floor, and then  he just takes the stethoscope off and shakes his head.  It's Dr. Steve.  He does that every day.  Dr. Steve's stethoscope should just be filled with wax.  Just candle wax.  He doesn't need it.  It's a minute of candy.  He eats it when he's hungry.  He doesn't hear much.  No.  Jimmy says it was a great thing.  Well, we got the other side of the argument. 
[01:09:30]  Here's a paramedic.  He says it's a pain in the ass.  Chris in Kansas, what do you got?  Yes, I'm telling you, those little old ladies do not need those things.  There's nothing worse than being paged out at 3.30 in the morning because grandma fell  on her shitter.  Oh.  It just, you show up, and they're like, oh, how's it going?  And you have to drag them up.  You don't get paid for it.  We don't get paid for the call, but we still have to show up.  They're a pain in the ass, and I wish they would go away.  Wow. 
[01:10:00]  Well, I'm only talking about from the old.  Yeah, I guess that would be annoying.  But you're in a good bargaining situation.  I would be the guy going, all right, how much you got?  Yeah, yeah.  What do you got?  And she's laying there.  I'm like, how much you got?  Oh, please help me.  How much you got?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm looking for much.  Just looking for some pocket money.  What do you got?  Yeah.  What do you got laying around for me to lift you up off the floor?  Exactly.  It just, it's a pain in the ass.  But you know what?  Whatever, man.  Punch it out.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Whatever, man.  Terrific call.  I was at the bank the other day and this fucking old guy was just yapping. 
[01:10:30]  Talking because he has no one to talk to.  Yapping.  I got shit to do.  Move out of my way.  I'm waiting on line and he's there and he's saying stuff like, I'll take it in through  two 50s and then 20s.  And she's like, oh, we don't have 50s.  Like, oh, oh, well, you know why?  Because I get gas over at the mobile station here on the corner and what I usually do is 
[01:11:00]  I pay for it in cash and I'm just sitting there like staring.  You feel bad, but you're like, come on, man.  And then he actually tried to get another conversation started and she was having none  of it.  No.  He's like, so busy here at Bank of America, is it?  And she's just like, here's your money and fucking leave.  I feel bad, but I also feel bad when I grab them by the back of their shirt and I get a  little skin and I say, shuffle off, motherfucker. 
[01:11:30]  And I throw them aside as the society has done.  Wow.  Yeah.  I grab the back of their shirt violently.  Well, you should.  Yeah.  Shuffle off, motherfucker.  That's terrible.  You know, I was at Home Depot getting smoke alarms, updating some smoke alarms.  Same shit where I finally found someone.  It's hard to find those people in the fucking orange, right?  I hate that.  And the guy is having this conversation, the same shit.  And there was two things going on. 
[01:12:00]  First of all, he was taking up two employees time.  Yeah.  And you could tell the employees didn't give a fuck, but they had to be polite.  And same thing like you're saying, he was trying to just keep the conversation going.  It's like, why?  I understand if no one's around, but if you see people hovering because they have questions,  it's time to fucking wrap up your conversation and move on.  Unbelievable.  They have no concept.  Is that selfishness or they don't know?  They're lonely.  This guy wasn't that old.  No, maybe he was just lonely, though.  A different case scenario.  But it's like, are you so unaware that there are other people around that really need to 
[01:12:30]  talk to these people?  Yeah.  You know, they have a job to do as well.  Or is it they don't give a fuck?  What is it?  They just, yeah, they don't think of anyone else.  Look, I try to just be aware when I'm out there.  I'll have a conversation with someone.  But then when you realize something, you know, oh, okay.  You move on, right?  Yeah.  Old people are annoying sometimes, but then it's like, ugh, that's just stinks. 
[01:13:00]  I know, yeah.  Nobody wants to hear what you have to say anymore.  Yeah.  But then again.  It's lonely, man.  You are obsolete.  Then again, at the end of my dad's life, he really looked forward to going to the post  office.  And I know it was kind of a social thing for him.  Go there.  Chit-chat.  Chit-chat.  See the guys, you know.  Oh, my God.  I guess that just is what happens to your life eventually.  I don't think any of us escape it.  I guess.  You know, if you're lucky enough to, you know, have a long life. 
[01:13:30]  Who are the old people that, like, don't fall into that?  Not many.  Rich old people.  Yeah.  Not many.  Yeah, because their families talk to them and say, I want the money.  Yeah.  Not many, I don't think.  Oh, man.  If you're just at the grocery store and they're talking to the fucking checkout person.  Yeah.  So, you know, I was going to get the Wonder Bread because I've gotten that one for years.  And I saw this other bread is on sale. 
[01:14:00]  And I tried it.  It would just fucking just pull a gun out and blast him in the face.  I think if you live long enough, life just becomes really sad.  I really, I don't know how you keep it going after a while.  We've all talked to old people.  They just want to talk about where the cheapest gas is in the neighborhood.  And they like to talk about food.  Oh, no.  And medical problems.  We've learned that.  Oh, medical problems.  Of course.  They love that at the diner.  That's pretty much the three right there. 
[01:14:30]  Pretty much.  They're talking about kidneys.  You know how you can stop it if an old person's talking to you too much?  I found this.  If the guy's talking to me, I'll stand in front of him and I go, hi-yah!  And I throw a punch in his chest.  Just right in the middle of the sternum.  That's that stop of him.  Every time.  Hi-yah.  100% of the time.  Hi-yah!  I throw a punch in his fucking chest.  Ah, shit.  This guy's grandma. 
[01:15:00]  What the hell?  Let him tell the story.  Cameron in Texas.  What's up?  Hey, hey, hey.  How's it going, guys?  Hi.  Hey.  Hey, uh, so my grandmother has life alerts and she's fallen twice within the last year.  The first time she fell, she fell at like 3 a.m.  She got up to go take a piss.  Luckily, she took a piss.  She went up, got back up to go back to her bed.  She fell.  She didn't have her life alert with her.  Well, her alarm goes off at like 7 a.m. 
[01:15:30]  And it wasn't shut off for like 30 minutes.  She just kept going off.  And luckily, her neighbor could hear it through the wall.  Oh, you must think if you're the neighbor, it's over.  And she's laying on the freaking ground for like 4 hours after she fell.  But you know what?  I could sleep anywhere.  If I fall when I get older and it's not a heart thing or something, just like whatever bed hit,  I'm going to go, you know what?  I'm going to take a little snooze.  Someone will find me.  I'm just going to nap right here.  I would.  I'm sleepy anywho.  Right.  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  That was terrific.  Another amazing phone call.  Another just amazing stellar call.  Amazing, really?  Is this the one?  I want to hear that dumb old bitty.  Let me see it, Sam.  Stop hanging out.  1990.  So she was all alone when I slipped and fell, hitting my head against the door.  I was bleeding badly.  I couldn't move.  I couldn't even reach the phone.  The only help I had was this life call pendant I wear around my neck.  I pressed the button. 
[01:16:30]  I've fallen and I can't get up.  We're sending help immediately.  That's not it either.  Oh, boy.  Where's the original?  I love the original.  No.  The falls are the best.  They're violent old people falls.  Yes.  In their dumb old person house.  What a great fucking scenario.  She falls on the linoleum and cracks her head on the door.  Yeah, but in the commercial there's no blood.  She said she was bleeding a lot.  Where's the blood?  In the reenactment.  I injured myself and couldn't get up.  Oh, she's in the tub.  Oh, how great is that?  She fell in the tub.  I would love to write some of these.  I'd have them falling in rock quarries on train tracks. 
[01:17:00]  I just pressed this remote control, which contacted Life Alert.  My 24-hour emergency response service.  Oh, this overacting douche.  You can tell she's an old actress.  You just wear this little pendant.  Hazel Irwin.  She's got to be dead now.  Hope so.  All I need to do is push a button if I need any help at all.  It's a two-way communication system.  If I didn't have Life Alert to have been able to get the help I needed as soon as I got it,  I wouldn't be alive today. 
[01:17:30]  Imagine being able to...  He looks like one of those guys that bombed the black churches in the 60s.  I didn't say anything either, Sam.  You think she's overacting?  Oh, totally.  She's got a shawl over her shoulders and the fire's going in the background.  37 alert.  Nope.  She was hoping to do some movies with Clark Gable, and now she's playing the old Betty  in the Life Alert commercials.  Complete classic version of I've Fallen and Can't Get Up. 
[01:18:00]  All right, let's see.  I think this is the same one, yeah.  Is it?  It's not the classic version than those motherfuckers.  That might be it, Anne.  I remember that one when she's reaching for the phone.  She goes like, I've fallen and I can't get up.  Yeah, she delivered it.  She says it like really...  Yeah, I think Anne's right.  Wow.  Well, as Sam continued...  When I became deathly ill, I was able to summon an ambulance...  An ambulance?  This might be it.  My family and my doctor without picking up a telephone.  Great.  I used this remote control to contact Lightroom. 
[01:18:30]  Another overacting old Hollywood broad.  My 24-hour...  Watch.  You just press this button and speak into the air and...  I'm having chest...  Oh, yeah.  This is it.  Yeah, I think it is.  This is it in the family, Mr. Miller.  I remember it.  I've fallen and I can't get up.  That's it.  That's it.  Yay, we found it.  She's under her walker.  Yeah.  What the fuck were you doing? 
[01:19:00]  Trying to do the Watusi.  I was just thinking that.  The Watusi?  Yes.  The Watusi?  Yes.  Oh, Jimmy.  I swear to God.  What a weird...  That is a weird thing to think of.  Go back.  I want to see the old lady who fell...  I was going to say jig, but people might get the wrong impression.  I want to see the old lady who was doing the Charleston.  The Charleston with her walker.  Calling paramedics and your family, Mr. Miller.  I've fallen and I can't get up.  Pause it.  I want to see where this cunt is.  Yeah, what is that?  Where is she?  It looks like the bathroom. 
[01:19:30]  No.  Yeah, it looks like her head's against the tub.  You're right.  Her head's probably against the tub in a giant bathroom.  She's splayed out in the walkers right next to her.  How'd she teeter over with a walker?  I'll tell you what happened.  She was fucking dropping a deuce and it was probably a two foot log and she stood up because  she didn't want to break it.  Nice pruny dump.  No, she knows that if the log breaks off halfway, she'll never be able to wipe it out.  So she has to fucking stand up and lean on the walker to get the log out and she fell 
[01:20:00]  forward.  So she's still got a log poking out of her ass?  No, what they don't show you is right beyond this in the bathroom, there's a log coming  out of the toilet.  It looks like a python sneaking out of the toilet.  But she knows it's a two roll wipe if she fucking breaks it off.  She has to have it taper nicely.  Oh my God.  Like trying to wear down a crayon.  God, I hate those.  Just keep wearing down that crayon with the toilet paper. 
[01:20:30]  I'll get to the end of this eventually.  And it never ends.  Oh, it never ends.  You got to think they found one of these broads with a dildo up their ass.  There's got to be one story of an old broad doing something.  My life called pendant.  Yeah.  What an attractive big fucking cigarette pack thing of plastic that your Grammy had to  wear around her neck.  Isn't it awful they couldn't find a small, it's just a giant beige thing.  Yeah.  With a big fucking red button on it.  It just says burden on it.  Yeah.  It just says rob me.  Rob me. 
[01:21:00]  Rape me.  Rape me.  Ah, shit.  Rape me.  I'm having chest pains.  I love that guy too.  I'm having chest pains.  He's shouting at the machine.  Can I see that one again too?  I want to see where he is in the house.  That was the classic commercial.  I think he's sawing wood.  Making a bird house.  Is he?  Something useless.  Let's see.  It's called response service.  Watch.  You just press this button and speak into the air.  Oh, wait.  Pause right there.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  He's sawing something.  He's got his miter box and his level out. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, he's got a saw and he's at the table sawing wood.  Oh, yeah.  It's clamped to the table.  He's making something stupid that he's going to tell his family about.  And I'm going to varnish it next week.  Who cares?  Or he's making a big cross.  And those goddamn jigger bulls move in next door.  But they won't last long in this neighborhood.  Hey, wait a minute.  It's what they don't explain.  Yeah.  He's having chest pains.  He's doing a bad man where he's building a cage to put children in and film them naked. 
[01:22:00]  They run around when you're in a cage.  It's so much easier to get the genital shots.  And by saving his life, they've actually ruined the lives of many children.  Yes, there's so many.  Pushbull kids need a life call.  Speak into the air.  I'm having chest pain.  Maybe you shouldn't be yelling.  Exactly.  Calm down, Grandpa.  Might as well play it through. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, she's the best.  Mrs. Fletcher.  Yes, you are.  You're always alone.  That's why you have that stupid.  The machine is taking the place of your children.  What a big 1989 machine that is.  So call to get free details by mail right away.  By mail.  No email.  By mail.  Mail.  Oh, my God.  Call now. 
[01:23:00]  Doesn't this seem ancient?  It really does.  By mail.  Let's go to Marcos in Yonkers.  He's got a story.  Marcos.  Good evening.  Marcos, where the fuck have you been?  Hey, I've just been hibernating, boys.  Still listening to you guys, but I haven't called in in a while.  I have this story about 10 years ago.  I used to be an EMT, right?  And this old lady in Yonkers, she had fell in her apartment, broke her hip, and she had  no family with her.  She was on the floor for about five days. 
[01:23:30]  And the reason why they called 911 was the feces smell that was coming out the apartment  because she shit and pissed all over her floors.  Jesus.  So that's one situation where the life of the earth would have came in handy.  Why wouldn't you just burn down her house?  Yeah.  Dude, it was horrible.  When we walked in, everyone, like the firefighters and officers, were standing in the hallway.  We're wondering, well, why are they outside?  We walk in, all you see is chocolate pudding all over the floor.  Was she naked when she fell down? 
[01:24:00]  No, she had like a pajama on.  Was she dead?  Was she dead after five days?  No.  No, no, no.  She had a broken hip, and she was really dehydrated.  Oh, poor old lady with a dumb hip.  Yeah, I feel bad for her.  I hope you took her face and mushed it in the shit.  Teach her never to do that again.  Like a dog.  Dogs learn that way, right?  Yes, they do.  Mm-hmm.  All righty, boys.  Just push her face, and it's bad.  Her hips all sore. 
[01:24:30]  How ironic if the old broad fell down and cracked her life alert underneath her pelvis.  That's also crumbling like fucking stale pretzels.  A lot of paramedics calling in saying...  Old rolled gold pelvis.  Hey, matzah cunt, what can I do for you?  A lot of paramedics saying this is a pain in the ass, this life alert.  I'm sure it is.  Oh, man.  Meaning it saved a lot of lives.  A lot of lives, because a lot of those people would have been dead.  Yeah.  While their sons and daughters are on their Caribbean vacation. 
[01:25:00]  Imagine how angry you'd be at that life alert if you're just counting your inheritance,  and then somebody has to go and get her.  She pressed her button.  Well, you're just about to get blown.  There's a mouth about to hit your cock, and you hear beep, beep.  Oh, fuck.  Why'd she fall again?  I'd be there with a little screwdriver putting some C4 inside the thing.  Push it, blow her head off.  Yeah.  Dumb old heads on the ceiling.  Or I would just attach electrical things to her genitals, so as she pushed it, it shocked 
[01:25:30]  her clitoris.  She never pushed it again.  That old thing going, what?  Hello?  I've been in stasis for years.  Matt says that they're called lift jobs.  What?  That's how they communicate with each other.  Ah, fuck.  Got another lift job.  Oh, wow.  Because you just got to go in there and what?  Lift them up?  Lift them right back up on their feet.  Lift them up.  Yeah.  I think this happened to my mom, I think.  Really?  Yeah.  She'd fallen and couldn't get up? 
[01:26:00]  No.  In her backyard, I think.  Oh, boy.  No life alert, huh?  I think she had it, yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I make fun.  And it worked?  This probably helped her out.  Oh, man.  We make fun of shit that affect us personally.  Of course we do.  Every day.  I think then she fell in the bathroom once, too, where she's staying now.  Oh, man.  That's where they got people.  Oh, boy.  They got people.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  I wonder if she found the blue comb.  There. 
[01:26:30]  I want to make a t-shirt that's just a blue comb.  That should be your logo.  That's it.  Just a blue fucking comb.  Who would wear that, do you think?  Anyone?  If you put Opie Radio with a blue comb as the underline, it'd be the funniest shit ever.  No explanation?  No, no, no.  Okay.  You know what you need to know?  You don't want to over-explain that shit.  How about then Sam wears it for his next multi-million viewer viral video?  How about you chip in with that?  Now we're talking.  King of the internet. 
[01:27:00]  Slow down.  I made a basketball video that's going to do well.  Well, by whose standards?  That was such a cool video.  I know, but then you search YouTube and you realize there's a thousand fucking basketball trick shots.  I'm like, well, I guess this is another one that's not going to fucking take off.  I went to my gym yesterday and I was on the treadmill and this guy's in the gym, the actual gym part of the gym.  Does that make sense?  How is there a gym in a gym?  Isn't the whole thing a gym?  Well, it's a basketball court.  A basketball court.  Thank you. 
[01:27:30]  I'm on a treadmill and everyone, all these treadmills face the basketball courts.  There's one guy in there and from full court, he just throws the ball over his shoulder.  He's not looking at the hoop and it swishes.  And I'm looking around.  People just don't notice shit is what I have discovered over the years.  Not one reaction.  And I'm on my treadmill going, holy fuck.  So I go in there.  I go, hey, could you do that again?  I would love to get that on video.  That was a second attempt?  Dude, actually, I'm shortening the story because I did finish my workout or most of it. 
[01:28:00]  I watched him do it three other times.  So then I finally went, all right, I got to go in there and see if he could do it again.  And I swear to you, because a lot of people are asking, that was the third shot when I was filming.  From full court.  He jumps in the air because that's how hard he has to throw the ball as his back is to the hoop.  How the fuck do you do that?  I don't know.  And then I talked to the guy.  He goes, yeah, one time, he goes, I'm out of practice now.  But he goes, one time, I did 21 out of 100. 
[01:28:30]  That's pretty good.  So then I'm excited.  Like, oh, I got something, man.  Finally.  That's close to 21%.  Exactly 21%.  God damn me.  As it was coming out, as it was coming out, I said it and I saw Ant had the you dumb motherfucker look in his face.  And it was too late.  And then he tells me, one other time in this gym, guys was betting on him. 
[01:29:00]  And he made three in a row.  Wow.  He made three in a row.  Where did you shoot this?  That's impossible.  At our gym.  What?  Oh, fuck.  Did I just fall for it?  Did you fall for it, too?  Yeah.  Is that why you?  All right.  I just did.  I did not.  Fuck.  So now we can't say gym?  What?  We can't say chip or we can't say gym.  So how are we going to talk to you? 
[01:29:30]  I can make that shot fucking easy.  Oh, yeah?  Fuck yeah.  Over the back of your head.  Boom.  And soccer.  Well, then you see that YouTube's filled with amazing basketball trick shots.  So back to the drawing board for the opster.  Back to the drawing board for the opster.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, I'll do 20,000, 30,000 views, but this isn't going to take off either on four.  It's an impressive fucking shot.  It's a very impressive shot.  Help sell this fucking thing. 
[01:30:00]  Put it on the Facebook page.  Let's get some views.  Do you even know the adulation from the people that you will get if you finally do get that  multi-million dollar, multi-million view video?  I've had some good videos.  Well, you have the big one.  The biggest one is mustard.  That's more of a show video, though.  That's not me.  I mean, I mean.  The mustard video is up to nine million, just about, but that's a show video.  And how about the fat lady eating Burger King?  Well, I fucked up on that because someone took my video and wiped out my tags, and then 
[01:30:30]  That's annoying that they wipe out the tags, and they wiped out my tags.  But they made their own version of the video, and that version went, I swear to you, I'm  not trying to compete with Sam.  I'm happy for Sam, and that is the fact.  And then it went viral everywhere.  Fucking everywhere, but it wasn't my version.  Who took the tags off?  One fucking guy took the tags off, put it on another website, and then all these scumbags  on YouTube, you'll learn when you're in this YouTube world, there's a lot of scumbags. 
[01:31:00]  They take your videos and make it their own.  So you shut that shit down.  Pirates.  So my version was three minutes and five seconds.  Does anyone give a fuck about this?  I'm curious.  And the one that went viral was two minutes and 56.  They wiped out my tags, and then they zoomed in slightly to wipe out my tag on the video.  Why would they do that?  And that thing went fucking bananas everywhere.  They just want their numbers.  My version made, I don't know, 350 Gs.  Boo!  Yes!  Use watermarks! 
[01:31:30]  Boo!  Yes!  Oh no!  I want to tell you something.  Oh no!  Grab the Ouija board!  Yes!  Watermarks!  Put your logo!  You're on the Ouija board?  You're...  G!  Hey!  Yes!  I get it!  Yes!  All right, we got the guy.  We got to take a break. 
[01:32:00]  We can get back to this nonsense later.  But that's what they do out there.  And then you get them shut down.  They write you like little piss boys.  All pissed off.  Like, really?  You fucking ripped off my content, dick.  I shut down like 12 people.  You've been shutting down, right?  Because now you're in that world.  Yeah, 12 or 15 people got shut down already.  But I swear, there's so many more out there you don't even know yet.  But I would bet over 100 people are trying to capitalize on your video.  Yeah.  At least.  At least.  So the Opster will be back to the drawing board. 
[01:32:30]  That's all right.  Camera in hand, wandering around.  The Opster.  The Opster is back at it.  When he calls himself the Opster.  The Opster's on the scene looking to go viral.  That's right, baby.  I was excited yesterday.  But then when I saw fucking amazing basketball trick shots.  And I named mine amazing basketball trick shot.  There's 100 videos basically that have the exact same title.  Oh, man.  That's how much that has been done.  It wasn't quite the eureka moment you thought it was. 
[01:33:00]  No, no.  Unfortunately not.  You know what might go viral?  Unfortunately not.  A documentary of you trying to get a viral video.  Oh, my God.  How ironic that would be.  Is that ironic?  Or is that a...  Well, not irony.  I don't know.  We've got to ask Alanis Morris.  Yes.  Or Alanis type of irony.  Although I don't think she really figured out the irony thing.  No one really does.  Everyone says things are ironic when they're not.  So that song was all bullshit?  Yeah.  Some would say?  Yeah.  Or we got that guy that made...  I'm only saying that guy because I'm having a tough time with his name. 
[01:33:30]  His name is...  And there was something that they wanted me to plug for him.  It's that a show has been added for me in Philly at Helium.  Thursday night's second show has been added because all the shows are expected to sell out.  That's exciting, Jimmy.  October 25, 26, 27 at Helium Comedy Club.  Thursday's second show has been added.  My kids should be born by then, so I should go down and see you.  Oh, man.  And I might need a few tickets.  What are you looking at?  Yeah, I guess for that.  How much longer?  Four?  Yeah, easy.  For someone else?  Yeah.  How much longer?  What are you looking at here?  Any hour. 
[01:34:00]  Like, any time it could happen.  Any time.  The pains have started.  What?  Yeah.  Well, they're called Braxton Hicks or something like that.  What?  They're like little contractions, but it doesn't mean go to the hospital.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  I'm in the...  It could happen any hour.  Opetta's on the way.  What?  Opetta?  I thought that's the name we decided on.  Opetta.  Opetta's a nice name.  What a horrible name that is.  What's wrong with that?  Opetta's nice.  I thought that's what we were doing.  Opetta Hughes.  I like that. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, God.  That's a terrible name.  Oh, I thought that's what...  That's my mistake.  Opetta Gregorina.  Rina Gregorina.  Oh, my God.  What an awful name.  All right.  Should we break and then get our...  Yeah, let's do that.  All right.  Let him know that he'll be in after the break so he doesn't look out there like, you know...  Make a documentary on you.  Oh, man.  He'll fucking drop a documentary on your ass in a second.  Yeah.  He looks like he should be an Obama guy.  Nope.  I'm confused.  Exactly.  He's very conservative.  I know, but he's got the look that he would probably vote a Mormon, huh? 
[01:35:00]  Oh, wow.  What do you mean by that?  A little darker.  Oh, jeez.  What, he asked?  He's from India.  Yeah.  He's got some darkness there.  He talks about that in the film, too.  He didn't realize that India has a little darkness as well?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  More people are dark than white, sir.  He talks about that in the film.  Around the globe.  His skin color, as far as color goes, is indistinguishable in a lot of ways to African and African-Americans. 
[01:35:30]  But he doesn't mind a little colonialism.  Hey, who doesn't?  I like a little colonialism.  Oh, Justin Stangl just gave me my next video.  What is it?  I can't share with anyone.  Why did he give it to you?  He just wrote me, because we are pals.  See, you're chasing it.  It's like Coke.  Oh, that's right.  You did a blast.  It's early in the evening.  Now, your whole night, you just want more Coke.  You've had a taste of that viral video.  It feels so good.  I got it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:36:00]  Thank you, Justin.  Big fan of my videos, by the way.  The guy from Letterman.  If it's a dramatic squirrel, that's been done.  Dramatic squirrel.  Is there dramatic squirrel videos?  Oh, yeah.  You haven't seen the dramatic squirrel?  No, because I've seen squirrels in Central Park, and I have thought, maybe I could do something  with the squirrels.  Nothing's going to top dramatic squirrels.  What I want to do with the squirrels, for real, these dopes, these tourists, fucking  film our squirrels like it's an animal that's going to be extinct soon.  That's not a squirrel, though. 
[01:36:30]  This is dramatic squirrel.  Yeah, but it's not a squirrel.  But that's the video, dramatic squirrel.  2.4 million views for dramatic squirrel?  And that's nothing.  This is one of the original viral videos.  Yes, that is an original viral video.  That's all it takes.  Dramatic.  Calm down, squirrel.  Squirrel, yeah.  We should break.  I got to piss down.  Yeah, we got to get this guy in.  All right, yeah.  All right, we got to get Dinesh D'Souza. 
[01:37:00]  Dinesh D'Souza.  Dinesh D'Souza.  He's promoting 2016 Obama's America.  Oh, yeah.  In theaters now.  There he is.  Hey, that's the guy from the movie.  How you doing, man? 
[01:37:30]  Take a seat.  Oh, he's in the movie, too.  Anthony saw the movie.  Oh, yeah.  Fantastic.  I'm a huge Obama guy, so I chose not to see your movie, sir.  Oh, God.  That's right.  Actually, I'm not.  I don't believe in either guy.  Yeah.  Just so you know, I don't.  They're real.  And might believe in one guy a little more than the other.  But I think he's starting to not believe in these guys.  No, no, I'm not a huge Romney fan by any stretch of the imagination.  But what Obama's done over the past four years, and the lack thereof, is a little disturbing. 
[01:38:00]  And I think somebody else should be given the chance to do a little better.  Yeah.  You know, I wish Romney would be a little more, you know, effective or articulate.  Yes.  All right.  Yeah.  How did this thing come about?  You wrote an article for Vanity Fair, was it?  Or was it Fortune?  No, it was Forbes magazine.  Oh, Forbes.  I'm sorry.  A couple years ago on the cover.  And it was, you know, it was the first article to take a different look at Obama. 
[01:38:30]  And the argument was, you know, Obama's autobiography is dreams for my father.  So, in the article, I said, look, well, nobody's really asked what were his father's dreams.  Right.  And there's a lot known about the dad.  He was an economist, a writer, and he wrote about taxes.  He wrote about America.  So, we can find out a lot about the dad.  And weirdly, when you look at the dad's views, and you match them up against what Obama's doing, man, the jigsaw kind of fits.  Yeah, it really is. 
[01:39:00]  I don't understand why people just want to write off the fact that he would be influenced by all these people that he grew up with, was very close with, worked with.  Why is it such a weird stretch to think that he was influenced by these people?  Well, what makes it particularly strange is because Obama says he was, right?  I mean, Obama wrote 500 pages on his upbringing.  And he talks not just about his dad, by the way.  He talks about Frank Marshall Davis, who is this guy.  I mean, think about the scene. 
[01:39:30]  His grandfather, once a week, would take him to the shack, the Waikiki shack of this guy.  This is a former communist, right?  And the grandfather and Frank Marshall Davis would, like, smoke dope and stuff.  And then Frank Marshall Davis would rail about America, evils of capitalism, you know.  And young Obama would sit in the side of the room and just take it all in.  Is that not going to influence a kid, by the way, who doesn't have his mom or dad around, you know, over a period of seven years?  You're looking for some type of authority figure, a father figure. 
[01:40:00]  And that would have to have some type of influence, yeah.  And Obama writes, I think he mentions Frank Marshall Davis something like 20 times in his book.  So it's not like he – and, you know, sometimes people do have associations when they're young.  And then when they're older, they go, well, you know what?  When I was young, I did crazy stuff.  But now I'm smarter and older.  But Obama's never done that.  In fact, in 2008, he was handing out his book like a campaign biography.  So he's the guy who's been saying, this is really important to me.  This is how I grew up.  So what we do in the film is we just follow that story. 
[01:40:30]  And he was literally a card-carrying communist, this gentleman.  Yeah, he was a communist in Chicago.  And then the party basically dispatched him to Honolulu to do activism over there.  And oddly enough, it was Obama's grandfather who found this guy and said, you know, the dad's not here, the mom's not here.  So let me find a black role model for young Obama, Frank Marshall Davis.  You raised a very interesting point, too, during it about – you're talking about when he talks about his upbringing.  You were raised in India, I think? 
[01:41:00]  Yes, I was.  And you were saying that Obama talking about what he saw growing up, it didn't sound like the black experience in America in the 60s or whatever.  It sounded more like what you had seen or what he was talking about from Indonesia.  His view of the world was kind of shaped by that, not by American racism that has gotten better.  Right, yeah.  You know, I can't believe how dumb I was on this because I thought when Obama was doing all this government expansion, I thought, well, look, I get it.  You know, he's like a civil rights guy because if you were a black guy in the South in the 50s and 60s, the federal government was like your friend. 
[01:41:30]  He desegregated the schools, you know, Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, Fair Housing Bill.  So the federal government really helped blacks out in the middle of the 20th century.  But then when I began to thumb through Obama's book, I saw, wait a minute, there's nothing here about Selma, Montgomery.  Not only is this guy never sat at a segregated lunch counter, but neither have any of his ancestors.  He's not descended from slaves.  So he really, the black experience is very distant from him.  But he's kind of a third world guy through his dad. 
[01:42:00]  In fact, he grew up in Indonesia for four years.  He's made multiple trips to Pakistan.  His mom was white, but she was a globetrotter.  She lived most of her life in Indonesia.  Obama made multiple trips to Africa.  So I thought, man, you know, this is a background somewhat similar to mine.  We both have this sort of, excuse me, bifocal view in which we see America both from the outside and from the inside.  And I think that's helped me to sort of understand Obama a little bit. 
[01:42:30]  It is odd because a lot of people do just think of him as, okay, he's had to have experienced the African-American experience  where you have trouble tracking down who your ancestors even were, a loss of identity almost.  But he had that.  He was really able to trace back who his family was and what they stood for, what they wanted.  Staunch anti-colonialists, right?  Right.  I mean, Obama's lack of identity came from something else.  It came from the fact that by the time he was born, his dad was gone, right? 
[01:43:00]  And then when he was 10 years old, he was living in Indonesia with his mom and her new husband.  And amazingly, she packed him up with his suitcase and sent him back to America alone.  She never came back.  And she lived the rest of her life in Indonesia.  So the big issue for Obama wasn't that he couldn't trace his ancestors,  but basically that his mom and dad both kind of gave him the dump.  Ditched him.  Wow.  Another point you raised about anti-colonialism.  I could never say the word colonialism.  Cologne.  It was anti-colon, yes.  Anti-colon.  He hates it.  Anti-colonialism is the actions he's taken in the Middle East or non-actions he's taken. 
[01:43:30]  And when you point out, okay, he helped with Libya by force, removed Gaddafi, was against  Hosni Mubarak, who was an ally of ours, but he does nothing in Iran and he does nothing  in Syria.  And is it because, do you think that those are just Iranians dealing with Iranians and  Syrians dealing with Syrians as opposed to?  Well, if you're an anti-colonialist, what's your goal?  I mean, your goal is you're basically saying, listen, America is this big giant in the world 
[01:44:00]  and we should reduce America's footprint in the world because we've been kind of stepping  on the world.  So here we are in the Middle East.  We're bullying everybody.  Our little surrogate Israel is kicking the Muslims around every few years.  So let's pull America back a little bit.  Well, how do you do that?  Well, one way you do that is you sort of weaken our allies a little bit and you don't worry  too much if some of the bad guys come to power because you're sort of rebalancing  a little bit.  So you're looking at the Middle East, you're going, well, Iran, okay, they want to get  a nuclear bomb, but they don't have any. 
[01:44:30]  Israel's got a whole bunch of bombs and we've got tons of bombs.  So let's not worry so much about Iran.  Let's reduce America's nuclear arsenal.  Can I ask you, this is a question I have for you too.  Is that necessarily an agenda of neutralizing things or, because like Ron Paul, I liked  Ron Paul's idea of foreign policy, which was basically just mind your fucking business  and get out, which I kind of liked.  I'm tired of the U.S. meddling everywhere.  And I'm not saying that we deserved any, a lot of the things that have happened, not 
[01:45:00]  11 or that stuff, but we just constantly meddle.  And it's annoying to me as a U.S. citizen.  Yeah.  No, no, I, I, I'm not disagreeing with that.  I'm simply saying, listen, if you don't want to meddle, that's really good.  But then you want to stay really strong at home because you're basically saying, listen,  let everybody do what they want.  But if they show up over here, we're going to kick their butts.  Because at that point, you don't know who's going to come to power.  Exactly.  They don't have to worry about the American influence in the world.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you look, if you look, for example, at a nuclear arsenal, I mean, most people don't  know why we have nuclear weapons. 
[01:45:30]  But the reason we have nuclear weapons is other countries have much larger populations.  I mean, the Chinese could, can put a hundred million men on the battlefield.  So if you're dealing with that, it's kind of good to have a few nukes.  Don't they only have, they have a lot less nukes than us though.  Oh, the Chinese have 300 and we had 5,000, but Obama's taken us down to 1,500 and that's  all right.  That's still a lot.  Who's in second place with that?  Russia.  And how much do they have about it?  They have the same as us.  But see, the problem is they're so poor now that they can't maintain their arsenal.  So they're like in mothballs. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, you don't know where that's going either.  Right.  You don't want to keep track of that stuff.  Now, what do you foresee for 2016 if Obama does get reelected, which, oh boy, kind of  pointing in that direction.  A little, so far it is.  To me, it's a little bit troubling because I think, well, look at something like our debt.  You know, now, every rich country can be stupid with money.  Like a rich guy can run up his credit card and it's okay.  And George W. Bush, in all fairness, was kind of profligate with the credit card. 
[01:46:30]  Five trillion dollars of debt almost over eight years.  But remember, Obama's five trillion dollars of debt in four years.  So this is a different scale of spending totally.  So I say if you have, we're now $16 trillion in debt.  If we spend another five trillion, which is fully anticipated, we'd be at 20 trillion,  21 trillion.  And think about that.  We'll be 21 trillion in debt and 10 trillion will be added by one guy, Obama, in eight years.  So from George Washington to Bush, 10 trillion, and that's over 200 years. 
[01:47:00]  And then we'll have added 10 trillion in eight years as a result of one man.  Now, how can that be good for America?  How can anyone say that's a good idea?  But do you think it'll continue at that pace?  I think it will.  And we'll add that extra five trillion?  I think it will because, look, the reason that the debt is so high is we have entitlements  that are in there.  There's very little of our federal budget that is pure discretion.  And so, and Obama wants to add more, right?  I mean, if you look at what Obama's done, it's not just, by the way, health care.  You've seen federal incursions into banking, finance, hospitals, insurance, energy, education, 
[01:47:30]  automobiles.  I mean, we've just seen a bloating of the public sector.  And I guess that's because that's, you know, that's Obama's philosophy, right?  The private sector shrinks and the public sector expands.  Wow.  Oh, it's troubling.  Yeah.  It really is.  It's, it's, I was saying that it's almost as if I would want him to win just so we could  all go, see, see, we told you, like, like, I just don't foresee this going well with another 
[01:48:00]  four years tacked on to, you know, it'll be, it'll be probably good for my career if Obama  wins.  It'll be good for our film because it'll, honestly, it'll have a much longer shelf life.  And then lots of, I told you so's, you know, this is actually George Will once said, it's,  it's always good to be a pessimist because most of the time you're right.  And even once in a while, when you're wrong, you're happy to be wrong.  You know?  Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Norton.  Go ahead.  I just wanted to ask you about the racial thing because you had a good debate with Jesse 
[01:48:30]  Jackson where you talked about race and you asked a good question about where race has  gone away and he gave you an interesting answer.  Yeah.  And it's relevant to this Obama stuff too.  But my question to Jackson was sort of, listen, you know, in a big country you can find racism,  no problem.  But, but like, where's the racism today that prevents young people like his kids or my daughter  who's 17?  How is racism keeping them down, preventing them from achieving the American dream? 
[01:49:00]  And Jackson basically said, I can't tell you.  It's, I have to assume, he says, that the racism's like underground.  It's like a covert type of racism.  But where I think Obama comes in is that the real appeal of Obama in 2008, his magic weapon,  and I still think he has it, is, is simply the idea that he's not Jesse Jackson.  He's not Al Sharpton.  He's a sort of, he transcends race.  And so I think for white America, it's like such a relief to have a black guy who like doesn't,  you know, hit you up for being a racist. 
[01:49:30]  He doesn't extort.  I think you said the guys like Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, white people felt like they were  being extorted or whatever, whatever the word was.  Yeah, I would call those guys sort of the shakedown men.  A shakedown, yeah, yeah.  And it's sort of like, listen, I'm going to presume you're a racist.  So what are you going to do for me to prove you're not?  And so we've been kind of doing that routine for 30 years and people are a little sick of it.  So Obama comes at you like a black guy who actually likes you.  And it's like, and you said people just want to help him.  And you're right.  I like that guy.  And I don't know why, because I don't agree with a lot of his taxing policies. 
[01:50:00]  I like some of his social policies, but there's something about him I just like.  You know what?  He's the political Oprah.  Because if you think about what Oprah does, why does Oprah have legions of white women as fans?  Because basically Oprah has a deal with them.  And she says to them, listen, I will never point my finger at you and call you a racist.  We're going to discuss all kinds of other stuff.  I'm going to open my heart to you.  And white women are like, oh, wow, it's amazing.  You know, to be treated with such respect when you expect the other.  And that's Obama.  That's part of Obama's magic weapon.  It is. 
[01:50:30]  But what other way?  Like, here's my question, too.  Like, just because a black guy or Oprah or whoever doesn't really make you feel that way about race, could it be that's the main thing that people find comforting?  Or could it be other things?  Like, does it have to be that that's the main thing they find comforting?  Well, I mean, Obama's got other other good things that we have to concede.  I mean, Obama's a nice guy.  He's got a nice family.  He's family man.  No interns under the desk.  You know, so you got to give that stuff to him.  And I do.  And you notice in the film we do.  We we we treat Obama. 
[01:51:00]  We show the appeal of Obama.  And then we also say, but listen, this guy has a very unusual background.  There's a lot of stuff about him that's not known.  I'm not talking about the birth or stuff.  I'm just saying, listen, what was his SAT score for getting into Colombia?  Who were his buddies when he was there?  What was his GPA?  Where's his thesis?  What was his law school test score to get into Harvard Law School?  All of this is unknown.  And that's odd for a president.  And it is kind of weird, like when you like, you know, Romney doesn't want to release certain tax things and Obama doesn't want to release certain school records. 
[01:51:30]  And I think that stuff should all be public record.  If you're going to run the whole show, I think every no brainer, right?  Every ounce of your life should be open for us to examine.  I couldn't agree more.  And what the film does is we basically say, but the worst thing about Obama is that his core ideology is unknown.  And the proof of that is that even today on the right and on the left, people say opposite things about him, right?  Some people say, well, he's a secret Muslim.  Oh, he's a socialist.  Oh, you know, he's an alien, you know.  Or on the left even, you know, now one group says, oh, he's a champion of, he's the new Martin Luther King. 
[01:52:00]  Or, you know, he's a progressive champion of the 99 percent.  But then there's another group on the left.  No, no, no.  He's sold out to Wall Street.  He's a pawn of Wall Street.  So, which is it?  I mean, how come at the end of four years we still have no idea what is the correct description?  Well, let me ask you this.  So, what is Romney going to do for the country?  Because he scares a lot of people, too, there, sir.  Right.  Just as Obama's resume is, I am not Jesse Jackson, I am not Al Sharpton.  I think basically right now, as far as I can see, Romney's resume is, I'm not Obama. 
[01:52:30]  In other words, listen, this is a referendum on Obama.  You like what Obama's doing.  You want to see more of the same.  Now, when I say more of the same, I mean, look, Americans have taken a huge hit in their wealth in the last five years.  I mean, something like 40 percent.  It's huge from the Federal Reserve.  Now, we cannot afford that again.  If Americans take another hit of 40 percent, America will stop being a first world country.  Right.  It's that bad.  So, to me, the Obama record is abysmal. 
[01:53:00]  If Obama were to ask Reagan's question, you know, are you better off than you were four years ago, there's no way he could win the election.  So, he's defying gravity.  It's only Romney's weakness that's keeping Obama where he is and Obama's sort of magic.  You've got to think the Republicans blew it by pushing this guy forward.  But compared to what?  Well, I don't know who else.  I don't understand why in a party that commands half the country, this is the pool of candidates.  Obama showed a lot of weakness there, and this is the best the Republicans could come up with.  That's fucked up, too.  Well, this is, you know, and even if you look at why our film has got so much traction, it's partly because the Romney argument is so narrow. 
[01:53:30]  Romney's saying, listen, Obama's a nice guy, Obama's smart, but he just has the wrong ideas.  And we're the only guys in the country saying, wait a minute, let's turn the mirror and ask, who is Obama?  Let's look at Obama.  That's why it's not just a trash piece.  A lot of people love writing it off at like, oh, it's just another trash piece on Obama.  It's like, first of all, I'd love to see more trash pieces on Obama.  The mainstream media seems to be part of his campaign now. 
[01:54:00]  It's so crazy.  I mean, when Michael Moore made his film, you remember in 2004, and quite honestly, Fahrenheit 9-11, it was full of conspiracy theories, wacky stunts, and so on.  But, I mean, this guy was like everywhere, right?  I mean, nobody said, oh, this is a ridiculous thing.  And this film, well, you've seen it, and a good bit of the film, the most incriminating parts of the film come from Obama.  See, Obama read his own book in audiobooks.  That was the brilliant part of the movie, too.  Obama's own voice from his own books doing the, yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, some people say, where'd you get this actor to sound like Obama?  We're like, there's no actor.  This is Obama.  His own words.  Oh, man.  And Obama will say stuff in the film.  He'll say stuff like, you know what, I didn't want to go to the mainstream professors in college.  I just looked for all the radicals, the punks, the Marxists, you know, the Chicanos.  I wanted to hang out with those guys.  I mean, this is all from Obama.  And it's his own voice, yeah.  Do you think that his thesis not being released is a part of, maybe he said, because the audio recently came out of him saying, yeah, I'm for redistribution. 
[01:55:00]  I wonder if that thesis not being out has something to do because it was what we consider very damaging.  Radical.  Yeah, maybe at that age, you know, you're young or whatever.  Yeah, and I also think at Columbia, Obama was hanging out with some dangerous sort of radical revolutionary guys.  And so, because think about it, he was there for two years.  There's not a single person who has emerged to date publicly who said, I knew Obama at Columbia.  I was in class with him.  Not even I roomed with him, but I knew the guy.  We had dinner together or, you know, not a single person. 
[01:55:30]  Now, that's odd.  There is just this absolute mystery as to where this guy came from.  Not literally, but, you know, where he came from.  And in some ways, literally, where he came from.  And people just seem to just blow it off and not really want to think about it.  Like, oh, I don't care about that.  And there is a definite race-based voting.  It's amazing when you look at the black votership and how many are voting for Obama.  And if you based your voting on race, I consider that being racist. 
[01:56:00]  Well, it's certainly, you know, it's certainly a little bit.  I mean, the thing about it is black Americans have taken a big beating in the last four years.  You think white unemployment is bad?  Black unemployment is huge.  There was an article the other day that basically said the majority of blacks have no wealth except their car.  Think about that.  So, for black America, this has been a very bad four years.  But even so, I think you'll still see a huge—one of the things in the film, by the way, we go to Kenya and we go to the Haruma slum of Nairobi and interview Obama's brother. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, his brother.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was amazing.  This guy is, like, living in a hut.  He walks through sewage to get to the street.  And the reason I thought it's interesting is that Obama has, in the last few years, 50 times said the biblical phrase, we are our brother's keeper.  It's part of his, you know, we all obligate.  We are our brother's keeper.  So, here's his real brother living in a hut, and Obama's not given one penny to help him.  It's kind of odd.  And imagine if Mitt Romney had a brother who was living in a hut. 
[01:57:00]  This would be, like, on the cover of Newsweek.  It would be everywhere.  He probably treated Obama like shit.  I think it was his younger brother.  Yeah, no, no.  I think so.  But that would be funny if he was just a dick growing up.  Obama's like, oh, too bad.  Some of us can relate.  You don't, like, all your siblings.  That's what you get.  Listen, I wouldn't say that Obama—look, people have complicated families and all this stuff.  But I just think it's odd, given Obama's ideology.  I mean, I'm not—you know, it's just that Obama's going around telling the rest of us to pay taxes to help people we don't even know.  And this is where the Republicans, I think—and I hope you kind of alluded to it—where this is the best they have to offer. 
[01:57:30]  I think one thing people like about Obama, all this other stuff aside, is that average people, regularly, or people who are middle class, feel like he at least understands the plight a little bit better.  Like, as a guy, I think people feel like—I know he's a Harvard guy.  He's a bit of an elitist, and a lot of people don't think he can be because he's black.  But, you know, he's a snob.  He's a Harvard snob.  But I think he relates to the average person a bit more than—the Republicans never seem to be able to put anybody out that regular people feel like they can connect to. 
[01:58:00]  Like, Clinton is a Democrat.  People felt like they could connect to on some level.  Bush, you know, I don't think people felt like they could connect to.  So—and Romney, I definitely don't think so.  Part of it, I think, is that these—you know, if you look at Obama versus Romney, for example, what did Obama do?  Obama graduates Harvard Law School, and he goes to Chicago.  And what he does in Chicago is he signs up with these Saul Alinsky guys, this sort of team of activists, 
[01:58:30]  and they actually train you in how to communicate with ordinary people.  And part of it is just pure strategy.  It's not like feel for the ordinary guys.  It's none of that.  It's stuff like, listen, if you want to communicate with the ordinary guy, you've got to listen to them and listen to what's important to them and say that.  You also have to look good.  You know, in fact, one of the things Alinsky told the activists in the 60s when he was alive is he'd tell them, listen,  if you want to get middle-class votes, don't look like a dirtball.  Don't go around unshaven.  Don't call the cops pigs and stuff like that. 
[01:59:00]  You know, clean yourself up.  And so—and weirdly, when I see—my office is right outside these Occupy Wall Street guys, and I say, you know, what's the difference between those guys and Obama?  And basically, Obama read Alinsky's book.  He's kind of cleaned himself up.  You know, he looks good.  Yeah.  And that helps him to identify with middle-class people.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I also want one thing, too, like you pointed out Jeremiah Wright, who was damaging for Obama, at least during the campaign.  But I never put much stock into that stuff because guys like other candidates, they all embrace Pat Robertson to get that religious 700-club vote. 
[01:59:30]  So they all embrace people that I find repulsive.  Like, all of them, you don't get that far in politics without having a list of shitty friends.  Like, you can't become the president without knowing a bunch of really rotten people, whether they're campaign contributors, whether they're people that used to work on your staff, whether they're people you associated with.  So I don't care.  I mean, yeah, Jeremiah Wright said some anti-American things, but is that any crazier than someone else saying that 9-11 was put on, you know, America because we're evil and we embrace homosexuality? 
[02:00:00]  I mean, so why give credence to any of that?  And if you're following a religious guy like that, you know, it's all crap.  Well, by itself, I would agree.  But I'm saying if you look at this group, I call them Obama's founding fathers because they're the five guys who shaped his life.  And it begins with Frank Marshall Davis and it ends with Bill Ayers.  And now you put these five guys. 
[02:00:30]  There were a couple of professors in there.  One was this Obama's mentor at Harvard Law School was this Brazilian socialist, a guy named Roberto Mangabiera Unger.  Very weird guy.  This guy recently wrote an article saying, listen, I'm really sick of the fact that America is the world's number one.  He goes, what we need is for China, Brazil, India and Russia to, quote, gang up on the United States.  I mean, why would somebody advocate this?  Yeah.  So this guy knows he's a radical.  So in the 2000 and he and Obama have been in touch, by the way.  They weren't just in law school.  They were they've been friends for years. 
[02:01:00]  So in the 2008 campaign, this guy knows he's a problem.  So he skips the country so that no one can interview him.  So the connection between him and Obama won't be reported.  Not that the New York Times was trying to chase him down anyway.  Yeah, sure.  So what the film the reason the film hits people is because it's this new stuff that people don't know about.  And they're like, oh, wow.  I had no idea that Obama was hanging with this guy for 10 years and that guy for 20 years.  So when you put Jeremiah Wright into the mix, then you see that there is kind of a pattern.  What kind of relationship did he have with Ayers? 
[02:01:30]  Ayers?  Oh, my gosh.  Well, first of all, look at the official story.  The official story is, oh, I can't possibly have anything to do with Bill Ayers because I'm from a different generation.  Our kids just went to the same school, you know, which is total nonsense.  Obama knew Ayers at least going back to 1995.  So at least 15 years.  And Ayers had a fundraiser for Obama in his apartment when Obama was running for the state Senate.  So they were friends back then.  Then they both got together on the Woods Fund, which is a charity foundation that gives away money. 
[02:02:00]  And they were both on the board together.  So they clearly worked together.  And then Ayers brought Obama onto something else called the Annenberg Challenge, which is another big educational fund funded by Annenberg, gives away money.  So we know that these guys knew each other.  They worked together.  They obviously were socially connected.  And this guy was an absolute radical terrorist.  I mean, this guy has the distinction with bin Laden of being one of the two guys to bomb the Pentagon.  Yeah.  So not to mention bombing a New York police department, not to mention being on the FBI most wanted list. 
[02:02:30]  I mean, look, all I'm saying is you think this kind of stuff would be investigated.  And taken on a one case basis, I could see what Jimmy's saying.  When you put all these things together, it's a pattern.  There's just a pattern there of and you can kind of build what type of person Obama is, who he was influenced by, by who you hang out with.  It's a fair point, yeah.  It's a good point.  Yeah.  They're telling us you have to go in the earpiece.  You're a very busy man.  You have other press, I guess. 
[02:03:00]  Other obligations.  Who's telling us?  Roland said he's got a meeting he has to go to.  Oh.  Roland said you have a meeting you have to go to.  Do you have a meeting to go to?  I'm all right.  I can stay a little bit longer.  Okay.  You guys can kick me out when you're ready.  No, no, no.  We get these communications and it's like...  Oh, no, I understand.  Okay, cool.  Now, about his father, it was a good point that was brought up in the movie.  If he wasn't around that much, why so much influence from him?  And why dreams from my father?  Are you asking me?  Yes, Jimmy.  If he wasn't around so much, why would there be such an influence? 
[02:03:30]  Well, here's why.  Because fathers are really important to sons, you know?  And if your dad isn't around, you're going to go one of two ways.  You're going to say, the guy was evil.  He was horrible.  He abandoned us, you know, to hell with him.  I'm going to go join a gang and I'm going to find another family or something like that.  And a lot of inner city kids do that.  They develop resentment to the father.  Now, Obama's mom knew that. 
[02:04:00]  And so, she countered that.  She admired the father's ideology.  And so, she kept telling Obama, listen, don't be angry with your father.  He was a hero.  He wasn't here, but you know why?  Because he's fighting for his country's freedom.  He's like Gandhi.  He's like Mandela.  So, Obama grew up thinking his father was like some glorious freedom fighter.  Now, in reality, the father wasn't that at all.  I mean, when Kenya was fighting for independence, the father was like philandering at Harvard.  He has four wives, eight kids.  He's a chronic alcoholic.  He kills a man.  And so, the point is all this is going on. 
[02:04:30]  But Obama grows up.  He's thinking my father's Mandela, you know.  And later, his sister comes to him.  His sister was living with the father.  And she says, Obama, you're crazy.  Your father's not this great man.  He's a weirdo.  He never looked after any of us.  He's a drunk.  He's a drunk.  And Obama's, then Obama, then in the film, we play Obama's reaction.  Obama goes, you know, the sky turned yellow.  Animals began to talk.  Meaning, he's totally stunned, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  So, then Obama goes, I got to go to Africa.  I've got to like find my father and find myself. 
[02:05:00]  So, what's interesting, I mean, the thing about the film is that there's a story there.  And it's kind of an interesting story of a boy who has a mythical conception of his dad.  And then reality hits him hard.  And then he has to go and find himself.  So, the politics comes out of that.  This is not like a policy film with a bunch of talking heads.  Right, yeah.  It's a story.  That's why.  Oh, just to tag on the end of that, about his father.  You brought up a great point in the movie also, that if you have a child whose father was killed in a war, like World War II, father's a soldier, the son never knew the father, but constantly his presence is in the house. 
[02:05:30]  There's pictures of him, photographs, that folded flag is there.  And it's almost a presence in the house.  And the son would normally talk up the father and talk about what a hero he was in the war and try to live up to that.  And that's kind of a great point as far as how Obama would have felt about his father.  And not only in that situation do you revere the father, but actually your real father could have been a flawed guy. 
[02:06:00]  But you wouldn't know it because he isn't around to, you know, get drunk and fall on the floor or start yelling at you.  If he was around him, Obama might not have ever thought he was that great a guy.  Yeah, yeah.  And there are some interesting similarities.  I mean, the father, for example, wrote an article where he was talking about, you know, the rich.  And what do you do about the rich?  I mean, he didn't say the 1%, but you can see what he was thinking about.  And the father goes, listen, you know, just tax the heck out of him. 
[02:06:30]  And at one point he even goes, let's have tax rates, and I quote him, of, quote, up to 100%.  Now, that's Obama's father said tax rates up to 100%.  Right, take it all.  I can just imagine, like, your tax form.  This is what I make.  Okay, send it all in.  Take it.  He says as long as they provide services, which is a very socialist, even communist thing.  Absolutely, yeah, socialist, communist.  Now, again, you know, come back to Romney.  If Romney's dad said that and Romney wrote a book called Dreams from My Father, people would be constantly comparing what the father said with what the son is doing. 
[02:07:00]  And, again, I just find it eerie that this is not even, like, brought up.  The mainstream media is an absolute arm of the Obama campaign.  Whenever they talk about Romney, it's always very negative.  They harp on every word he said and find the negative in it.  And Obama, it's like they're praising everything this guy does.  Well, you know what it is?  I think what it is is many of these guys feel like it's almost like America's racial reputation is at stake.  It's, like, morally important for America for Obama to win. 
[02:07:30]  And so, in a way, if you look at these guys, they're not even praising Obama.  They're just praising themselves for being such morally wonderful people.  Look how great we are.  That's right.  And that's why Chris Matthews, like, you know, look, he's normally a pretty hard-bitten guy.  He's a pretty tough guy.  But you listen to him talk about Obama.  It's almost embarrassing.  It is very embarrassing.  Yeah, and one thing I liked about the movie, it's obviously slanted.  It's certainly not a pro-Obama piece of work.  But it made me, while there are certain Middle East things that did worry me, like, yeah, like, you made some great points, things that I hadn't connected. 
[02:08:00]  In a weird way, it made me like him more as a guy.  Like, his personal story about, like, having these revelations about his father humanized him to be in a way, while still learned things about him that I didn't like politically.  So I thought it was, you did a great job with that, of not being so slanted in one direction that it was just this chop piece, because I didn't feel like it was that at all.  Well, see, I appreciate that a lot, because if you listen to the left, they're basically saying, oh, this movie's propaganda, you know.  But the truth of it is, I think a middle-of-the-road guy who goes to see the movie will come out and probably have something like this reaction. 
[02:08:30]  And you know what, I actually feel sorry for Obama.  The guy has, it's not easy to be thrown into the world like this.  I'm sorry for him, and yet I'm not sure if I want him to be acting out his problems on the world stage.  There's plenty of things about him that would be absolutely fine if it wasn't the fact that he's our president during a pretty difficult time.  Right.  I just don't think he had the qualifications to start with. 
[02:09:00]  The way he talks about foreign policy and laughs at Romney about it, when the truth of the matter is, he really doesn't have, and especially when he first came in, had no foreign policy experience.  The other thing is, even on the issues that are core to his campaign, he doesn't really say what he thinks.  I mean, for example, consider the slogan, the fair share.  Okay.  Now, half of Americans pay no income taxes.  Now, that may be fair, but it's not obviously fair.  I mean, you have a country, no taxation without representation. 
[02:09:30]  Well, you think the opposite is true.  Why should there be representation without taxation?  Shouldn't people who have less money pay at least something?  Something.  Isn't it weird that half the country pays nothing?  Okay, so the rich pay 36%, 37% right now.  Well, maybe you think they should pay more, but what is fair?  Do you think they should pay 40%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 100% taxes?  Obama has never once said, you know what?  This is the fair amount.  And if everybody paid that, then I would be content.  Then we'd be all paying our fair share.  So he keeps all the fair share, but he never says what the fair share is. 
[02:10:00]  What he's really saying is that, and I agree with that, that's an underlying, it was almost like when Johnny Cochran said to the jury,  you have to do the right thing because you have to go back to your neighborhoods.  What he was really saying is, you know, you have to go back to these black neighborhoods.  Do you really want to convict this guy of murdering this?  Like he was talking to them.  There was a real subtext to what he was saying.  And I think that's a subtext Obama gives to poor people.  Like, you know, people have to pay their fair share.  What he's saying is, get these rich son of a bitches, and they should be paying a lot more money. 
[02:10:30]  There's a real subtext to it.  Somehow they're screwing you.  These rich people are screwing you guys over.  It's like, wait, they're not paying federal income tax.  Right.  And what is the fair share?  Yeah.  Well, this is why, look, I mean, you know, if you, let's say you're dependent on the government and you're getting stuff,  the general response should be gratitude, right?  I'm not working, but I'm getting a check every month from the government.  So, but I think what happens is when people get free stuff, they feel a little bit ashamed.  So what Obama does is he comes back and basically says, listen, you're not getting free stuff. 
[02:11:00]  You shouldn't be ashamed.  You're actually being cheated.  You deserve a whole bunch more free stuff.  And the guys who actually are pulling the wagon, you know, you're sitting in the wagon.  But the guys who are pulling the wagon, they're the bad guys.  You know, they should be giving you more stuff.  It's amazing.  And you think about it, that's going to tell more people who are pulling the wagon, hey, I better get in the wagon.  Things are a little warmer in there.  What does that do to America?  I agree and I disagree because you're right about that.  But I also think that the people who are pulling the wagon, a lot of times have done a very bad job of making their, 
[02:11:30]  and I mean the top ones, have made a very bad job of making themselves empathetic.  Like when you catch guys like Bernie Madoff, who I know is only one guy, but that's not an isolated incident.  And like the damage they do, like even if you're broke and you're on welfare and you're a leech,  and there are people who are doing that and it's enraging.  None of them have ever caused, like stolen from Holocaust charities or a billion dollars worth.  Like when these guys do damage.  So it's almost like they have not made a good case either. 
[02:12:00]  It's very difficult for me to side.  Couldn't agree more.  I mean I think ultimately the case for free markets is not the case for rich people.  The case for free markets is protecting competition, protecting incentive, and prosecuting the bad guys like Madoff consistently.  So there is a room for regulation, but the regulation should be to protect the market, not to undermine the market.  How about if we stop giving money to Egypt?  The second biggest, I think, recipient of U.S. foreign aid in the last.  How about we stop giving money to the Middle East to try to influence the way they have Sesame Street for their kids? 
[02:12:30]  How about we stop giving money to everybody?  We should stop giving our money away and then that money can be kind of used here.  And again, that's a more of a Ron Paul idea about pulling our troops out.  Why do we have troops in Germany?  Why do we have troops in Korea?  We don't belong there.  These are old alliances.  They're old alliances.  Who are we protecting?  And Egypt is in a transition, it seems, toward the Muslim Brotherhood, which is the largest organization of radical Islam in the world.  Why we'd want to give them money is a very open question. 
[02:13:00]  But I have no problem with them running it, though.  If that's who they want to run it, let them have them.  They wanted the Taliban.  They gave their weapons up to the Taliban in Afghanistan, and that's what they got.  Let them have it.  It certainly does go with your film about getting some of these countries and pulling them up and pushing America down  and equaling that playing field out in that anti-colonialist mindset.  I mean, look at the way Obama – clearly, Obama is not happy with the state of Israel.  Now, right now in the campaign, Obama is like, I'm Israel's best friend and so on. 
[02:13:30]  But for the past four years, if you just look at Netanyahu's face when he's with Obama, he looks dismayed.  Yeah, yeah.  And so what's happening here is that – and again, you see how the colonial thing fits so beautifully.  I mean, Israel is just seen as a little colonial power sitting on Muslim land.  The guy called it a Trojan horse.  In the film.  Yeah, yeah.  A Trojan horse in the Middle East.  And if that's true, by the way, then the problem isn't the West Bank or Gaza or even the 67 borders. 
[02:14:00]  It's Israel.  It's Israel.  Yeah, the whole thing.  So in some senses, if you're an anti-colonialist, you're going to think about, you know, how can I make Israel back up and go?  That's not an easy thing to do because the Jews aren't going anywhere.  But there are ways to really weaken Israel.  And remember what happened to South Africa in the 90s.  You know, it was suddenly in no time, apartheid was discredited.  The whole system collapsed.  And it's not that we don't have South Africa, but it's a totally different country.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Where can people see this movie?  So the film is in theaters for two and a half more weeks, but it's winding down its theatrical run. 
[02:14:30]  So the point is, if there's a theater near you showing it, go see it because it's a fun film to watch in the theater.  It looks more like out of Africa than it looks like some CNN documentary.  But it will come out in mid-October in DVDs, video on demand.  So it'll be easy to get in other formats by the middle of next month.  I'll tell you what's fun about seeing it in the theater is listening to some of the people.  Certain scenes, you'll hear people go, oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, God, come on.  You'll hear people, like, they're so outraged at certain things, or they're laughing at certain parts. 
[02:15:00]  They're like, oh, really?  Now, that was me, by the way, saying that in the theater.  I didn't find it objectionable.  There were parts of it I disagreed with.  No, you'll agree.  You'll disagree with certain things, but it's done very well.  I thought so, too.  And I want to try to pronounce your name correctly.  Dinesh D'Souza?  Flawless.  Okay, thank you.  Well, in high school, I was voted, boy, most likely to properly pronounce the name two years ago.  And it is called Obama 2016? 
[02:15:30]  It was 2016, and the subtitle is Obama's America.  And by the way, I have a book, Obama's America, same title that's out there that elaborates more about what America would look like over the next four years if Obama got a second term.  Companion.  Yes.  Companion book.  Got a companion volume.  A handbook.  You're a very smart guy, and I enjoy the documentary more than I expected to.  And I say even the parts I disagree with I thought were well done, and it was obviously a very well-thought-out piece of work.  And it was really good, man.  Go see and get a little enlightenment about where Obama came from. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, once every four years, it's kind of nice to get informed about what's going on.  It's your country, after all.  Great.  Dinesh, thank you so much.  I have to use the bathroom.  It's been a pleasure.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  He's so horny.  Serious Exim.  Here at the Church of Norton, we believe in preaching the true word of the Lord.  A man shall not lay with another man, unless they discuss it first.  Can I get an amen?  Join us and be inspired by the wonderful sermons led by Pastor Jimmy. 
[02:16:30]  I am like Davey versus Goliath.  He's tall, so he can put it right in my mouth, much like those youngsters did.  Can I get an amen?  Follow in the footsteps of God.  Honor thy mother and father, and occasionally take the penis of another man in your mouth.  And become a true disciple of Christ.  Eat my cock, drink my cum.  We've all read the book.  Can I get an amen?  Everyone is welcome in the arms of the Lord and at the Church of Norton. 
[02:17:00]  Can I get an amen?  How about A-boy?  I prefer A-boy or a few.  The Church of Norton.  If there's no hair on him, I'm going to fuck it.  Can I get an amen?  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  You rock. 
[02:17:30]  Na-da-da-da-da.  It's bad guy Imus today.  Evil Imus.  Got my black cowboy hat on and my black blazer or something.  He looks much younger in black.  Yeah.  Should wear more black.  He's crazy.  Twitter, man.  Some love the interview.  Some are like, what the fuck?  Why are you giving this guy time?  Well, I wonder why.  I wonder why the people are divided.  I love that one.  Why are you giving him time?  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  Because he's got ideas and a film and opinions and it's America and he's got a right to say  what he wants.  He did a documentary.  If you don't like it, don't like it.  How many people come on this show and praise Obama?  You know, we get a lot of celebrities, a lot of lefties that come in here and give them.  Not many, really, on our show.  What?  Really?  I've sat here and bit my tongue some days.  Almost hurt.  Why would you bite your tongue?  Yeah, because it's not a political fucking situation.  You get someone like Patton Oswalt coming in or Chris Rock and they start spouting off 
[02:18:30]  about Obama.  That's why you should talk up.  Yeah, fuck it.  Because they have the debate.  People want the debate.  It's not going to change anything.  No?  No.  Nah.  Should we bring Eliza in?  We have Eliza...  I wasn't going to say it too quickly.  Eliza Schlesinger.  Yeah.  Who was here before.  Yes.  Very amusing.  Yes.  How come you're still eating your cereal?  I asked for a couple minutes so I could slam some cereal and I guess the message didn't  get up to E-Rock. 
[02:19:00]  Hi.  Yeah, E-Rock, you came to Eliza.  Hi.  Yeah, you came back too fast, E-Rock.  No.  No one told me.  Who did you tell?  Did I tell you?  I don't know.  He told me and Travis.  He told me and Travis, but E-Rock usually eavesdrops so we figured the mics are on.  Yeah.  It's okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember you from last time.  How are you?  That makes me feel good.  Yeah.  Thanks.  It's a nice introduction.  Confidence, yeah.  Oh, yeah, you.  Oh, you again.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  I thought it was great.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was pretty cool. 
[02:19:30]  I was sitting there shouting.  I was like, yes.  Yes.  Everything you were saying.  You're Romney, yeah.  No, but I agree with what you're saying.  I was going to say guy, but you're a girl.  It's a lesser of two evils kind of thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Who, Romney or Obama?  Either.  I'm not ecstatic about either.  Yeah.  It's great.  Yeah, neither are terrific.  Yeah, the whole country seems that way.  Everybody's just like, ugh.  Yeah.  Like Obama, you'd think with the way he was pretty much Jesus Christ four years ago,  that he'd be running away with it.  Right.  And then the other side, the country's in such bad shape, you'd think anybody could just 
[02:20:00]  step in and become president and beat him.  I've thought about it.  But it's crazy.  Especially in L.A.  You can't, if you say any, it's almost, it's like a witch hunt.  You can't say anything.  No.  Secretly, people would be like, oh, by the way, I'm not totally into Obama.  What?  Racist.  Racist.  You're a racist.  I hate black people.  Yeah, it really, it is even worse out there than it is here.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, here it's bad, but out there it's just a fucking complete show business culture. 
[02:20:30]  Big sham.  Everybody's so obsessed with showing how open-minded they are.  Yes.  Liberals are so obsessed with that until you disagree, and then it's, we're going to burn  you at the stake.  Not so open-minded anymore.  No.  They want your mind to be open as long as you agree with them.  Just second, you don't.  The whole thing, and we don't have to talk about it since the guy left, but I want to know  where liberals think the wealthy, what they're doing with their money when they're not paying  taxes.  They're not putting it in mattresses.  It's all, I actually have a big pile in my house, and I just throw it up in the air  and maniacally laugh. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I hoard it all.  I burn it in my fireplace, too.  It doesn't trickle down.  I don't know.  It's a little chilly.  Those guys have really big bank accounts.  Big bank accounts.  Yes, to swim in.  But you know what?  Really big bank accounts.  You buy things.  You still buy things, and those things have to be made.  By somebody, and people you have worked on.  I just think the whole focus on, oh, they're not paying taxes.  Who do you think funds museums and parks and scholarships and all?  I mean, I'm not saying that that makes up for it.  I'm not saying who I'm voting for, but. 
[02:21:30]  Imagine someone living in your house and doing nothing but bitching and just complaining about  you and saying you're not giving them enough.  Like a wife.  Like a wife.  Yes.  Imagine that, though.  Wouldn't that piss you off?  That's exactly what's going on.  You get people that aren't even paying income tax.  And federal income tax.  Shut up when they come up.  You know the payroll taxes and don't get.  Yeah.  Federal income tax.  You know the giant biggest one that you have to pay every year?  Yeah.  The people that don't pay any of that. 
[02:22:00]  Will that ever change, you think?  No.  People are assholes.  We'll always be like that.  It was so calm.  I got you all fired up.  Everyone was so calm.  I'm all pissed off.  No, I'm always like this.  I'm terrible.  That's okay.  We want to find out what you're up to.  And then we got the Matt Paxton guy outside from Borders.  Yeah.  Matt's the best.  But I can't watch it and eat at the same time.  Wow.  Who could?  It's disgusting.  Disgusting.  It's a real reaction.  It's awful.  Not even the garbage.  The people.  The people are awful.  They disgust me.  You want to see a horse with a zit?  No.  Yeah.  Don't show her that.  Do you really?  Is it going to be so disgusting?  Do they pop it?  Although the cow one's better.  Yes. 
[02:22:30]  I think the cow one might even be.  The horse one's more disgusting.  The horse one's more disgusting?  Am I going to cry?  No.  I might.  Am I going to cry?  I don't know.  I just want to know if you could eat and watch this video.  I'm not going to watch it.  Oh, no.  I can't even watch most things online.  I can't watch my own show.  Right here.  Big, huge zit.  Is that by you?  I don't know yet.  It's probably like the size of two grapefruits, I would say.  Let me squeeze it.  Sam's not hitting play.  What do you think of, Sam?  She's cringing.  I love this.  We don't have to watch the whole thing, but just give you a little taste of this.  Yeah, I don't find this to be.  Can you eat through this? 
[02:23:00]  I don't know about it.  She's so disgusting.  That's not.  All right, there.  It's done.  Oh, God.  She's caking.  I haven't eaten anything today.  All right.  Jimmy, try to.  Honestly, that's not.  And it's finally done.  It's just a zit.  See, finally done.  You can look.  Oh, my God.  You can look now.  It's finally done.  My face is in the air.  It's still going.  She looks at it.  No, it's not.  Well, then turn it away if it's not going anymore.  No, he's just pulling a big piece out.  Get out of here with that.  That's the end of it.  You want to see the end of it.  I don't see.  That's gross, though.  What was at the end?  It was just water.  Is it a happy ending for a zit? 
[02:23:30]  No, it's actually just water.  You just put the bandage on now.  Why do I have to keep watching?  I know.  Because it's just weird how large.  I put the mic flag in front.  I don't even look.  I can't watch this.  Stop.  Why can't you watch this?  Turn that PC monitor away.  That bothers you?  Turn that inferior monitor away from me.  You can watch a movie on Obama, but you can't watch this.  Can you watch?  It's amazing me.  I'm going to start.  It's chunky.  Yeah.  Yeah, the computer broke.  We don't know how to shut it off.  If I throw up, it's going to be on you.  There you go.  Look.  It's broken.  Plus, I want to see it. 
[02:24:00]  Stop.  I'm not watching.  I can't watch this.  Yeah, the Bob Kelly can't watch it.  Why don't I come here?  I know, right?  All right, can we show you the cow one?  Can we show you the cow and then you can decide which one's worse?  For sure, let's see.  The cow one is not even...  I'm very thrilled about this.  All right, and then we'll move on to what you're up to.  You don't want to know what I look at.  I don't want to.  Really?  I do, actually.  Yeah, we do in a second.  You watch porn?  Well, it's a funny story.  Handjobs?  It's a funny story.  Sometimes, once in a while, I'm going to get in trouble for this, but it's okay.  The contestants on my dating show, once in a while, may or may not have a porny background. 
[02:24:30]  So we'll Google their names.  If your name ends in rows, chances are you take D in the mouth.  And so I'll sit...  Okay, it's going to have to...  And so I'll sit in my green room with my producer and we'll just Google the contestants' names  and we find them.  We'll start watching their porn.  And then that porn begets another porn begets another porn.  Of course, yeah.  I found this website called E...  Can we curse on here?  Yeah.  Called E-Fucked.  Oh, yeah.  We know that one.  That's old, dude.  Yeah, it's like MySpace.  Really?  What's wrong with you?  I'm a girl.  It's a little different, you perverts.  Wait, where's your dating show on? 
[02:25:00]  It's syndicated.  So here it's on WWOR.  Nice.  I couldn't tell you the title.  Oh, cool.  That's excused, right?  Was that 11?  Excused.  Channel W-O-R.  Was that 11 or channel 11 or no?  I think it's channel 9.  Oh, 9.  Okay, so it's on.  9 here in New York.  But it's...  The time changed.  Okay, the cow.  Excuse me.  Yeah, that's okay.  You just play it, Sam.  But what videos do you see on E-Fucked?  I'm just...  Well, there's one...  There's this one of this...  I think she's a Kiwi and she's adorable.  And she's giving a guy a bead, but she gets like really into it and makes like a pirate 
[02:25:30]  face at one point and starts speaking in tongues and I thought that...  Can I show it to you?  Yeah.  I'll pull it up after we watch this.  We're sharing videos today.  Here's the cow video first.  Is that the zit?  Yeah.  That's not a muscle?  No.  No.  No, it's as big as a medicine ball, I think Jimmy said.  Yeah.  On the right back leg of the cow.  My mouth's watering.  Like in the bottom right now.  No, watch what this guy does.  This is actually not...  It's just liquid.  It doesn't even...  It does not look...  It'd be awesome if you squeeze it and milk came out.  Yeah.  Watch this.  Watch how he takes care of it.  A little knife.  I feel bad at the poor cat. 
[02:26:00]  A little knife.  He didn't even like local.  Give it a local.  He just...  You got to pop the zit.  Oh, poor cat.  Look.  Oh, my God.  She's gagging again.  Listen to the sound.  That's the juice hidden in the ground.  And the zit and the pus.  This is so bad.  This is watery pus.  You smell that.  That's not bad.  No, I don't like it.  All right.  It's done.  It's just liquid.  I'm still fasting from yesterday, so I'm nauseous.  All right.  It's done.  Oh, you are fasting?  Yeah, I'm just going to keep it going for all the week to see how much weight I can lose.  I just wanted to show you that.  Stop it. 
[02:26:30]  It's still going, and it's pink.  It's like you-hoo.  That's what I'm saying.  It doesn't look that bad.  Or it's like...  What is it?  Quick.  Nestle Quick.  Yeah, Quick.  It looks like strawberry milk.  Strawberry milk.  The pile is white.  That's not a zit.  That's a cyst.  Oh, yeah.  A cyst.  Okay.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, some kind of infection.  Cist.  Zit.  The cow is so unhappy with this.  He's just wagging his tail.  That's a cow going, what the fuck?  Are you sure he's not saying I love...  Oh, he's shitting.  Oh, is he?  Is he shitting, too?  Yeah.  It feels so good.  Or that, or it hurts so much that he crapped himself.  What a great pile on that floor.  Just passing.  I know.  It must be nice to just let your shit go whenever you want. 
[02:27:00]  Look at the white stuff.  Plus his wife.  Like babies.  I see it.  On the ground.  That's kind of gross.  That does nothing to disgust me, though.  The other one was chunky.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  That was worse.  This is just...  Huge.  The form of it at first was gross, but now you can't help but turn it into something delicious.  Yeah.  Where are you working?  You're just hitting the ground.  She's at Gotham.  Oh, Gotham.  Okay.  Are you there tonight?  Tonight through Saturday.  I'm going to show this video.  On loop.  There you go.  I'm there tonight through Saturday.  Friday, Saturday, and Thursday.  In that order.  We want to show these videos to people we like, by the way. 
[02:27:30]  You what?  We want to show them to people we like.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  That's good.  All right, now you show us a video.  What's your problem, man?  I guarantee Eliza's video is going to be a lot better.  It's actually for this one face this girl makes that I peed.  And then I'll show you a video of a fat girl falling that I can't stop laughing at.  Oh, really?  Fat girl falling.  Is she black or white?  Black.  Which makes it better.  I think we know it.  The one where she's singing on the table?  Yeah.  That's great.  It's the greatest video ever.  It's the greatest video.  Yeah, she goes down.  That's more important than the Zapruder film as far as I'm concerned.  I feel like you guys watch a lot of porn. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Let me ask you a question.  Not as much, sure.  If you go on YouTube, which I know doesn't have porn, and you Google anything and...  Okay, I'll say this.  Sometimes I...  You know what a twerk team is?  No.  It's these black girls that go around shaking their asses.  And they're in videos and stuff.  And sometimes I'll Google black girl booty dance because I like to practice.  And so if you watch...  If you YouTube search enough of the words like girl, dance, woman, eventually, if you watch  enough videos, you'll get a video for a live birth. 
[02:28:30]  If you Google anything on YouTube, if you watch enough videos, eventually a birth video  will come up.  Has anybody else found this to be true?  So you get a video, you watch it, and then it gives you the suggested video.  Click on that eventually.  But further down the rabbit hole, eventually you'll see a vagina and it'll say home birth.  All videos lead to home birth.  Home birth.  It's the weirdest thing.  I'm going to look into this.  I've got to find this for you.  Just give me a second.  Yeah.  No problem.  Give me a second.  We love it.  You fucked.  Is this somebody who was on your dating show? 
[02:29:00]  No.  Unfortunately, no.  Oh.  Okay.  I tried to get her, but I think she's dead.  Oh.  Oh.  I didn't know she's dead.  What are the odds of her being alive?  All right.  It's wrong.  It's going to take me a second.  He fucked.  I never go to this site because there's too much weird stuff.  Like, I know if I want to see the beheadings, I have two sites I go to.  Oh, man.  And, uh.  No.  I don't like when the porn site is also intermingled with guy gets head run over by truck tire. 
[02:29:30]  Because then you're looking at porn and then there's a little video in the corner of some  fucking chop meat head.  You've got to separate those two topics.  Yes.  That can do nothing but damage you.  You've got to separate them by at least one load.  That's got to do something to you, though.  Like, having this sexual kind of thing going on when you're watching a video and then having  death videos.  Yeah, I don't mix the two.  I have a question, Eliza, too.  Yes.  Somebody says, why does Eliza Schlesinger feet, the first suggestion for her name in Google? 
[02:30:00]  I don't know.  It's the weirdest thing.  A lot of girls, it's feet.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  If you search for girls, a lot of it is feet.  But it isn't as if I walk around with a lot of open-toed shoes.  You got nice feet, though.  Yeah, I got great feet, but.  Do you attract foot fetish guys?  Apparently.  I mean, how about when you date?  Like, are there guys that like your feet or is it not?  No.  Big boots.  No?  I have boots on now.  No.  At least, I don't know.  I probably break up with them before I can find out.  You don't want to know, right?  Should I just play?  It's really just one frame that I find hilarious. 
[02:30:30]  That's all good.  Let's do this.  Why don't you sit down a minute?  Oh.  Oh.  It's getting kind of late.  It's getting late.  At least it's organic, believable dialogue.  It's not a guy that would say that.  You can sit a little while, though, huh?  No.  Maybe he's getting late.  Yeah.  Why don't you just sit down?  Oh, she shoves him down.  Surprise, motherfucker.  It's raping time.  It's a slow blow job.  Look at her face.  It's coming up. 
[02:31:00]  The pirate face.  All the faces are funny.  Bath salts equals insane sex.  If you guys are looking for it.  I don't think we can put that on our Facebook page.  In my life, I've never been like,  does this do it for you if I close one eye?  And just glare at you?  It really is a pirate-y face.  A pirate's job.  Play more of this.  I want to see the faces.  I think that's the best one.  Yeah, but...  Oh, shit. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  You like me chewing on your balls?  Like...  Fuck my tongue with your tongue.  Chew on it.  Chew on it.  Like fucking Kinnison.  She's licking...  She's getting spit on her finger  and rubbing her clit.  Fucking make love to me.  Fuck me.  Is he wearing a vest?  It's a vest.  It looks like...  Fuck me.  Fuck me like a fucking...  Oh, it's a watch.  Give it to me.  It has her lines written on it  like Brando used to do.  It sounds awesome. 
[02:32:00]  That's the way we like to fuck.  Keep fucking...  Keep fucking me.  I like her.  I like her.  Fucking fucking pussy.  Tell me you can't fucking abuse my pussy.  Fuck me.  What do you mean, what, Fran?  The whole video's great.  Fuck my pussy until I have no pussy juices left.  Like Dana fucking aggressive me.  Slap me there.  You ever slap the fucking gun?  Fuck me.  Stop fucking slap me.  Kill me, you pussy.  Fuck me.  Slap me.  This guy's gonna abuse my fucking scaggy little pussy. 
[02:32:30]  Wow.  This guy is so miserable.  Yeah.  He hates it.  Oh, fuck you.  They're on a bus, by the way.  Disrupting everyone.  Are you looking at me already?  Cocaine is a hell of a drug.  All right.  Wow.  I love when they slow down.  That's really funny.  That's a good one.  Satan's vagina.  Where's her accent from, you think?  I think it's New Zealand.  Oh, it is New Zealand.  She looks New Zealand. 
[02:33:00]  Damn.  God, that's funny.  So that's what I do at my job.  I'm a dad.  That's pretty good.  Should we get Matt Paxton in here?  Yeah, let's all hang together.  We're so late, though.  All the guests are backing up.  Yeah.  So he'll hang with us.  Yeah, of course.  Matt's a good guy.  Yes.  And you're at Gotham tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Correct.  Very funny comic, Eliza.  Matt!  How you doing, Matt?  Hey, Ben.  Take a seat.  All right, sir.  Is he gonna have to watch the video?  Oh, no.  The horse?  No.  It won't bother him.  No, we don't like him.  That's cleaner than most of the things he says.  We don't like you.  Thanks. 
[02:33:30]  Matt Paxton from Hoarders.  Oh, yeah.  What's up, everybody?  Clutter cleaner.  What's going on?  Yeah.  It's been a while, sir.  Yes.  Coming to see you tonight.  You are?  Yes.  I didn't know you were here.  Really?  What a coincidence that is.  I don't get to the city much.  This is exciting.  You already got tickets, or should I get you something?  No, I think we already bought them.  You sure?  And you already knew you were gonna go see her?  Yeah.  How weird is that?  She's a pretty big deal, man.  I know she is.  That's why she's in here.  That's why I got to watch the horse video.  Right, guys?  Yes.  That's right.  That's right.  What's this horse video?  Do you want to raise your mic a little bit?  Terrible.  Can you help Matt?  You can take this later. 
[02:34:00]  It's not for you.  It's terrible.  Why?  He does the hoarding thing.  I think he can.  This won't bother him at all.  I don't know where.  He'll look at that horse puss coming out and fucking laugh at it.  Let me just access this data.  It's a big, huge horse zit that they pop.  Oh, it's a horse zit?  Do you ever watch the ones with people's zits?  It's terrible.  It's so good.  But it's gratifying.  See, I think those are worse.  It's also gratifying a little bit.  Yeah, it is gratifying.  Well, you do that for a living.  You pop zit messes.  It's like a house zit.  They're very infected. 
[02:34:30]  I mean, we've done this all morning.  Now I've got to block.  I put the mic flag in front.  A little taste.  Isn't it bad?  I don't have to look.  It's not bad.  I can eat yogurt and watch this.  It's not bad.  There's something wrong with you.  Isn't that bad?  Oh, my God.  It's not bad, right?  That's terrible.  What, the hoarder guy's getting freaked out?  That's disgusting.  Really?  You don't like that?  Isn't that horrible?  No.  That's horrific.  It's terrible.  And I just cleaned up 15,000 pounds of someone's urine.  15,000 pounds?  That they freeze it and put it in blocks?  Excuse me, gallons. 
[02:35:00]  Gallons.  It was old Gatorade bottles.  That's like a tanker truck.  It was a whole house.  Yeah.  Of urine?  And actually, legally, we couldn't put it on a tanker truck because it was too much urine.  Too much urine to transport?  I had to figure out how to legally get rid of 15,000 gallons.  Back up.  Tell the story a little bit.  So they're saving it on purpose?  It was her mother's?  No.  She was saving it on purpose.  I'm kidding.  She just literally could.  It was her mother's.  Her mother died.  And she felt bad about throwing it away.  And then she started peeing in gallon jars.  So they were hoarders before.  The mom was a hoarder.  This lady, fascinating. 
[02:35:30]  She had gone under the radar her entire life.  She was like 45.  And the state didn't know she existed.  She was totally off the grid.  Her mom had just hit her.  Then her mom dies.  And the county finds out about her.  And it's by far the worst house I've ever been in.  I mean, there was five-gallon buckets of shit all over the house.  Just to open.  And they can show that on TV or is it all?  No.  Actually, the network called them today.  They're like, we have to blur half of the show.  That sounds like your season finale.  It's not even a finale.  Oh, really?  No.  When is this one?  There's a liquid cat one that was even worse.  A liquid cat?  A refrigerator full of liquefied cats. 
[02:36:00]  These people should be shot.  I had to throw my clothes away because it went through the time exit.  Oh, my God.  I literally left the place just in my underwear driving.  Well, now, the liquefied cat place, were they people still eating in the house?  She was living there.  Yeah.  I had to spend the new thing this season.  They got me spending the night.  Yes.  Spending the night.  Because it's haunted?  No.  They just want to...  All half of the ratings, obviously.  That's why you're here.  Awesome.  I know.  This is going to be good.  They wanted us to see what it was like to be in the mind of a hoarder at night. 
[02:36:30]  And I figured I knew it all.  I've been doing this most of my life.  And it's totally different.  I mean, once the lights are out and there's no sun, like, you're laying there trying to sleep.  And then all of a sudden, you feel something moving under you.  And you're like, is that a rat?  Is that a cat?  Is that a person?  Yeah.  Like, what's that crawling across me?  Like, what's that in my hair?  Have you had, like, roaches crawl on you and fleas?  Oh, I had, yeah, roaches.  Have you ever found a body?  A dead body?  A person's body?  Another body.  The guy, Corey, the other guy, she found a body.  A body?  Yeah, the lady had rolled it up in a...  Her husband had died.  He rolled it up in a...  What is it?  A shower curtain. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, my God.  And then she just forgot.  They rolled it up in another body.  I'm still going to get you in on a horde.  I just haven't found a good one.  Let's go, Matt.  I haven't found a good one.  I've been waiting.  We've been right back in.  I'm trying to find a New York one.  Can I ask you a question?  Yes.  Because I watch that show.  I watch all of them.  I watch all that filth.  When...  Do you ever...  Because the people are not mentally...  Like, they're not sane.  No, they're messed up.  Do you ever, at the end, just wish you could shoot them in the head?  These people will vote eventually if they take their medication.  They will never vote.  They will never get out of the house.  They might get to the...  But they're doing...  Like, they're...  What's the point of having them on the planet?  I mean, I guess it gives you a job, but...  It does. 
[02:37:30]  It supports my family.  I will say, this year is the first year.  I was like, what the fuck are we doing here?  There's nothing I can do to help this person.  Are you ever meeting them?  Really?  No, I can't be.  I'll make fun of them on, like...  Behind their backs.  As a part of the team.  No, like, I'll actually...  I'll pick on myself, and I'll pick on them, and I'll try to get them...  They've been alone for 10, 15 years.  One thing I've seen Matt do is...  You don't take any crap when they start giving you...  Like, you won't just off the bat walk in the house and go,  Hey, you slob!  Look at this place!  But when they start going, like, getting all rambunctious about their dumb little thing,  I'm not throwing this away! 
[02:38:00]  And you were never a son to me!  And Matt gets in there and goes,  Hey, this isn't what we're addressing here.  Yeah, we were filming on Father's Day this year.  And, you know, as a new dad...  I've never actually been home on Father's Day.  I've been filming all three Father's Days.  We've been alive.  And this lady started saying I was a bad son.  And I was like, bitch, please!  And I just lost my shit.  You went all black and sassy.  I was like, let's go!  I was like, here you go!  I was like, get a bag!  And so I made her just pick up dead cats for, like, two hours.  I gotta go back to the liquefied cat thing. 
[02:38:30]  How does a cat get to the point it's liquefied?  And how is it in the freezer?  You put it in a Ziploc first.  And then you label it.  And then you put that label on the Ziploc.  Then you seal it.  Because you gotta know what day the cat would die.  Oh, well, of course you do.  Sure, sure.  It's good to document.  You need to be organized.  Then you put it in the lettuce drawer of the refrigerator.  And then that fills up.  The crisper.  The crisper.  And then you go to the vegetable, the fruit one.  And then it just fills up and fills up.  With different cats.  You know how, like, when you ever clean a house where there's, like, a little bit of...  Oh, so it wasn't in the freezer.  It was in the actual refrigerator.  Oh, the whole thing.  It was all the way.  The freezer was easier.  The whole thing. 
[02:39:00]  The freezer's easier because it's frozen.  Right, sure.  You just pull the whole...  You can get 100 cats out with one pool.  Yeah, meat and vegetables and everything just turns to mush.  There was no food.  It was all cats.  How many cats?  I stopped at 250.  I stopped at 250.  Wow.  And there was definitely more, obviously.  It was awful.  Wait, can I ask you another question?  Yes.  So, you know when they come in and they sit...  Monday night's 9 o'clock.  And when they sit with the hoarders, like, the therapist comes in and she goes piece  by piece through each piece of garbage.  She's like, can we keep this?  Can we not?  I don't sort dead cats.  No, not you, but them. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  But do you guys ever just, like, lose your patience?  You're like, it's all garbage.  Oh, yeah.  And you ever usually, like, snap on them?  Oh, yeah.  Because they'll go through gum wrappers and be like, this one means something.  It's so stupid.  And, like, 11,000 gallons of urine.  They don't deserve rights.  And, like, 11,000 gallons of urine.  I was separating by the color of the urine.  And I was like, this is dark.  This is clearly your mother's.  This is light.  This was clearly yours.  I was like, this was your mom's.  This was yours.  Oh, man.  Can we let your mom's go?  Since she's not going to use it?  Like, she's passed away.  How would you feel if I took this bottle of urine outside the house and just, you know, 
[02:40:00]  took it away from you?  Then they would freak out.  Exxiety level 10.  Exxiety level 10.  Well, this season has just gone.  And each one is, like, I say Hoarders All-Stars.  Like, each one.  I mean, it's still a TV show.  So, obviously, the network's trying to pump it up.  And TV's not doing great across the board.  So, of course, they're doing things to switch it up.  But I actually dig the spending the night thing.  Because it's just so different.  And it totally.  I don't get freaked out a lot anymore.  Do you talk into, like, a night cam?  I mean, you're like, I just had a turtle.  Oh, it's a very Blair Witch-y way. 
[02:40:30]  I have not taken a shit.  You've seen the rats?  You've seen the rats, right?  When you've been sleeping overnight?  The rats are everywhere.  What about mice?  Mice don't make it easily.  It's either the cats have made it.  Like, the cats beat out the mice and the rats beat out the cats.  And the rats also beat out the mice.  And the roaches beat out everybody.  Roaches will win every time.  You'll stay in one of their houses without a cot or anything?  You'll sleep on their bed?  You'll just lay wherever they were laying.  Yuck!  And there's one this season where I had to just lay down.  I mean, it was just cat shit.  I just had to lay down in a pile of cat shit. 
[02:41:00]  So how long are you really in there?  I made it about ten minutes on that one.  And I just couldn't do it.  And then they make believe you were sleeping.  No, I'm honest with it.  All right, let's film ten or fifteen minutes.  I'm honest with it.  It's just me.  They put GoPros up, and it's just me.  Wow.  And me and the hoarder.  And so, I mean...  Oh, you should talk to this part.  Like, tell each other bedtime stories.  Yeah, we're just hanging out.  It's kind of like college.  They're hanging out in a bunch of shit.  They've never been to college.  Do they keep asking if you have to shit?  I do ask.  The network is like,  we've got to eat dinner with them.  I'm like, I'm not going to eat dinner with these people. 
[02:41:30]  You know they're just circling you,  wondering when you're going to shit  so they can collect the goodness.  He tries to be polite now to him,  would you like to use the living room?  Did you see a clear baggie  with M. Paxton written on it?  Just waiting and waiting.  Target bags, I have learned this year,  Target bags are the preferred bag to shit in.  So how about we get...  The Walmart bags are too thin.  How about we work a deal out with Target  and say, stop selling the fucking bags?  I'm sure they're getting pissed  of us showing the bags.  How many cockroaches have you seen  in one time?  We saw one.  This is a great story. 
[02:42:00]  We did one in St. Louis  where the house, like,  it had about two feet of cobwebs  across the roof.  And the cockroaches would run up the wall  and just live.  So it was about two feet of cockroaches.  They were living in the web?  They were living in the web.  It was full.  And it was just raining cockroaches.  Oh, man.  You would hit it  and just hundreds of cockroaches  would come down.  But this is the good part.  This is the good part.  We convinced...  Did I just totally ruin your day?  That's the minute I got here.  That doesn't sound like  a nice living situation.  Here's the best part.  We then convinced the junk guys  that they had to duct tape  their assholes 
[02:42:30]  so the cockroaches  wouldn't run up into them.  Come on.  And one of the new guys was like,  okay, sounds like a plan.  I'm going to do this.  He went in a truck  and duct taped his ass.  You've got to duct tape  this guy's penis  into your asshole  to make sure that...  Make sure...  None of the other guys...  I mean, these guys do it every day  so they know it.  This one guy totally fell for it.  But then poor Emilio Estevez  had to confess that  in the breakfast club.  Ripped it off  and skin came off.  It was terrible.  I'm pretty sure a cockroach  isn't going to get in my asshole, though.  No.  No way.  These cockroaches will.  No fucking way, man.  That's the safest place in the room.  The guy that... 
[02:43:00]  I forgot what his name is,  but he was the guy  that spent time in the house  on the last episode, was it?  And it was bugs  like all over the place.  Spiders.  That was a giant spider  on the wall.  Yeah.  And then he's sleeping  in this house  where it's just bugs everywhere.  I know nothing about bugs  and I need to know more  because you're looking  and you're like,  wow, that's a really  interesting looking spider.  It's like three inches wide.  Like, hmm,  I wonder if it's poisonous.  They get big from eating cats.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, liquefied cats.  I want to see the video of...  Sam, can you help me 
[02:43:30]  find the video of the...  I want to see that  cobweb roach thing.  Is that online anywhere?  It might be, yeah.  I really want to see that.  That sickens...  Broaches really creep me out  more than anything.  Anything to get that  fucking horse thing off there.  That is disgusting.  Not a lot disgusts me.  That does.  Yeah, raining cockroaches  would get me...  So that one story  isn't going to be  the finale of the show this year?  No.  Could you give us a hint  of the finale?  So I've got three more  to film this month.  Oh, okay.  And I have no idea  what they are.  They've gotten smarter  and they don't tell me. 
[02:44:00]  Right.  I just show it.  I get the right up  on the plane.  Now, they do fly me  two days early now  so I get to hang out  with the hoarder a lot more  and get to know them.  Do they fly your coach  at first?  Dude, backseat middle, man.  Every week's time.  Oh, my goodness.  Thank you, our travel agent, Anna.  We call it the Anna special.  She's a bad person.  I thought it was just this place.  I'm like,  first I'm cleaning up shit  and now, I mean,  literally, at one flight  I was behind the bathroom.  Like, the one seat  right next to the bathroom.  Yeah.  You should love the bathroom.  Just pissing in bottles  and leaving them on the plane.  I mean, it is reality TV.  We're bottom...  Are you afraid  you're going to be 
[02:44:30]  mentally scarred from all this?  I did.  This season I got attacked  by a crack addict family.  Really?  And that fucked me up.  Yeah, that comes on in two weeks  and that was...  Jeez.  This dude, I didn't...  We just thought the family  like had some dead problems.  They all got some issues.  A lot of my guys are recovering.  We all got issues.  I got addictions.  We all got them.  A lot of my guys are recovering addicts  and so I was trying to give  the guy the benefit of the doubt  but as soon as we got  to the bottom of this room  I realized, shit, we got had.  Like, the whole network  just got taken.  This family just had  a bunch of needles  and a bunch of crack  at the bottom of this room  and they just wanted us 
[02:45:00]  to clean it up.  And so we're filming  and I realized, I was like,  mother fucker.  We just got taken.  Cleaning up a crack house.  In two minutes, literally.  And I mean, we had filled up  three or four of those  sharps containers with needles  and we were already at our limits.  When this guy comes back  out of nowhere,  just irate and just totally,  I mean, fired up.  And he told us  that he had done a lot of time  so I was like,  the guy's up front,  I'm, you know,  but he told me he was sober  and I was like,  this fucker ain't sober.  Why was he mad at you?  He said I took some of his crack  which I didn't.  Which you did.  Oh, man.  You cleaned it up.  Clear.  I did find,  I took some needles  that I told him he couldn't take 
[02:45:30]  because I didn't want my guys  to get pricked.  And the guy just fucking went nuts  and just came after me.  And like,  and I'm obviously clearly  not a fighter  and all I did was just  move out of the way  and he just fell on the ground  into a big puddle.  But he got in my face.  A liquefied cat.  He had me in my face  just screaming.  I'd never been in a situation  where I was like,  fuck, I'm going to get  my ass kicked like hard.  Right.  And I had my ass kicked.  What are the cameraman doing?  Just fucking filming it?  They put their cameras down.  Oh, wow.  That's when I knew  I was in trouble.  Yeah, because they never do that.  Nobody was filming.  One big guy? 
[02:46:00]  No, God, no.  We got nothing.  And I'm looking around.  I'm thinking,  well, I hope the radio,  I actually hope it's rolling  because this is going to be  a good scene.  And then I realized  that they took their cameras down.  I was like,  fuck, I'm going to get  my ass kicked.  Wow.  I'm feeling a lot of similarities  between your show  and my dating show.  We have similar contestants.  I don't know if you call  yours contestants.  Wait, where's,  Matt, is it on that page?  I'm looking for it.  I'm looking for it.  I really want to see  those fucking roaches  living in the ceiling.  They're just,  what do you like,  as far as the show goes,  it's got to be a fine line 
[02:46:30]  because there's the  cluttery hoarders  that have just a lot of clutter.  A lot of things they buy,  new things that are still  in the bags.  And then the disgusting hoarders  where there's shit and piss.  And I got to be frank with you,  man, those are the best ones  on the show.  Those are the ones I get.  They're just disgusting.  Where I lose my shit  is on the ones  that are like paper hoarders.  Yeah.  Like, I know I'm not  interested in short-toothed paper.  I need,  I'm a recovering addict,  so I need,  this is my high, man.  Like, this is my new thing.  So now if it's like, 
[02:47:00]  I need 251 dead cats now  for the next one.  Like, 249 doesn't do it.  It's not doing it for you.  It just didn't enough.  I think we probably  asked you this last time,  but what was the worst smell?  I have a new one for you.  Oh.  And it's really,  I was thinking about it  this morning,  and it's really for you.  Oh, thanks.  This is,  we've started doing  to hit on the other issues.  Obviously,  we're all recovering addicts.  All my guys are ex-cons,  and so we all have that need.  Uh-huh.  And we've had to,  just hoarding isn't enough anymore,  so we've started doing  crime scene cleanup now.  Holy shit.  And the bio-clean stuff. 
[02:47:30]  What?  And we,  and it's actually,  it's extremely lucrative.  Like, unbelievable,  no one wants to do it.  Right.  Clean a dead body,  nobody interested.  And if you can do it  with compassion,  it's extremely,  extremely lucrative.  So we really dig it.  And our first one was a hoarder,  and we tell all the hoarders,  we're like,  if you,  you know,  if you don't clean this up,  you can have a heart attack,  you're not gonna make it out of the room.  Oh, wow.  Well, the guy didn't  make it out of the house,  and he died at the front door.  Oh, shit.  But he was a loner,  nobody,  this is in our home,  in Virginia,  where I live.  And we get the call  a month later,  after this 100 degree  summer that we had. 
[02:48:00]  His body sat there  and decayed  for a month  before the neighbors smelt it.  I got out of my car,  and I was like,  holy shit.  Just right there  in front of the building.  Just 100 yards out.  So then,  this is where it gets  really interesting.  The cops get called.  Bless you.  Bless you.  The cops get called,  and then they,  this comes up  on this guy's record  that he had been arrested  before for possession  of C4.  Holy shit.  So he had,  they had proof of him  having bomb-making materials  in the house.  Bomb squad comes,  and they find booby traps  in the yard.  Wow. 
[02:48:30]  And so they're like,  we can't go in.  We gotta use a water cannon.  Well, at this point,  we didn't know this dude  was up right against  the front door.  It's over there.  100 yards out,  they put a water cannon  on the front door,  and it just rips  the front door.  A water cannon will open it?  Oh, my God,  it'll blow a house up.  I mean,  it's as strong as a gun.  It'll just,  it just ripped the door  right off.  It's like a battering ram.  But what we didn't know  was there was this  one-month-old body  that had just been decaying.  It's like a gelatinous,  you know, jello.  So it rips his body  wide open.  It has to come apart.  And his stuff  just goes all over.  So then,  and there's no body now 
[02:49:00]  to remove  because the body's gone.  So they're like,  all right,  can you clean this up for us?  It's like Saw.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's awful.  It just seems like  such a serious issue  to be dealing with,  and the psychological  ramifications for someone like,  I mean,  this is the same network  that airs like Lady Hoggers  and like Dog the Bounty Hunter.  Now the dog got canceled.  Okay,  but Cajun Justice.  Yes.  So it just seems odd  that they would take on  such a mentally heavy show.  You know,  people love,  it makes them feel better  about their own life.  I love it.  That's why people watch it.  Yeah, I think it is.  What was the biggest part 
[02:49:30]  of the body you found?  There had to be  one piece of the body.  Yeah, this was the best part.  We did look for,  no, we did look for a penis.  It's just rolling on the floor.  Yeah, everybody kisses it.  Look at me.  We found,  and let me make it clear  for any A&E executive listening,  this was not an A&E show.  This was a private job  that we did.  I get in trouble for that.  We,  when they got the body part cleaned up,  that was fine.  I remember,  a lot of my guys are,  I mean,  I got one guy  that did 20 years for murder,  so he's happy to,  he's really happy  to just have a job. 
[02:50:00]  Have someone kill them for him.  Yeah, he's,  he's seen all that,  so it's not as big a deal  for a lot of my guys.  But it's messed me up.  Since I've had kids,  it started to mess me up  a little bit.  But this one was weird  when I went to,  I thought there was a big rat,  a dead rat I was picking up,  and I,  and it was stuck  to like this big pile of paper,  and I'm pulling on it,  pulling on it.  And I'm in a full bio suit,  so I've got a mask on,  and,  I mean,  you can't see anything,  and I pull the hair.  Well,  I pulled what I think  is a dead rat.  I think it's rat hair,  and I pick it up,  and I realize it's a scalp.  It's this dude's mullet,  and he's got a sweet-ass mullet 
[02:50:30]  about two feet long.  Holy shit.  And so I look at my partner,  and of course,  his mask is filling up,  but he's just throwing up.  Just left it right.  Holy shit.  So we,  and you can't take off your mask,  because then you're compromised.  So he's running out of the house,  and the whole time,  I'm like,  do I put the mullet on my head  for a picture,  or do we just let it be?  That's what I would be wrestling with  at that time.  That was a question I was wondering.  Yeah,  you're going to find a mullet  ever again.  Like that.  Yeah,  sure.  It was awful.  Oh,  wow.  We ended up,  we found rocket launchers. 
[02:51:00]  We found a,  we actually called the bomb squad  three times on that.  This guy was crazy.  He was out there,  man.  Yeah.  We found a landmine  from like Vietnam.  So we had to handpick the house.  What happens to the house  after you're done?  They had to demolish it.  How many states,  like,  do you do this in?  It's just in one.  We'll go anywhere.  It's just all in Florida.  Yeah,  we'll go anywhere.  Florida is very,  Ohio and Florida is very,  very,  Florida is one of the most,  no offense.  Florida is one of the most  disgusting places.  Sorry,  mom.  In the world.  You want to go to Alaska  because it's cold,  so things won't stink as bad.  I've never been to Alaska.  All the frozen cats you can eat. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  We should go to Alaska.  Hoarders,  Alaska.  Wow.  Do ice road truckers  and hoarders together.  We can pack it all up.  Hawaii is really bad.  Every house.  We did a hoarder's house  in Hawaii  and I was just excited  to go to Hawaii.  Yeah,  sure.  And we drive down the street  and we stopped at two other houses  thinking that they were  the hoarder's houses  and they weren't.  That bad?  Yeah.  You talk about being compromised.  What kind of shit could you get  if you didn't have that mask on?  Oh my God.  I mean,  the Hanna virus is bad.  That came up a couple weeks ago.  Right,  one of the clean crews  from another show  didn't properly test it. 
[02:52:00]  The main thing  is your lung diseases  and then all the  you could get infested  and get some really bad  intestinal diseases.  Parasites or whatever?  You get some really bad  intestinal diseases.  You're just breathing in  unless you have the masks on  and you're breathing in  like,  yeah,  shit.  You're round up shit.  It's just,  I mean,  it's fecal matter.  It's fecal dust  and that'll get,  just like salt  on your meal  except it's poop.  Except it's,  I feel bad  about complaining  about cigarettes  at comedy clubs.  Yeah,  not so bad.  But like,  if you put me in a cube, 
[02:52:30]  like in a regular job,  I'd go crazy.  Right,  right.  Now I couldn't  ever go back  to a legit job.  I wouldn't know  what to do.  Oh yeah.  Are there any comedy  stuffy office?  Someone put their stuff  back at the desk,  you're like,  what are you doing?  I'm straightening up.  What the fuck?  For what?  Is there any comedy clubs  that you can smoke  in anymore even?  I think the Improv  in Addison  and then there's one  in Jacksonville.  I think the Comedy Zone  in Jacksonville,  Florida,  I want to say you can.  Addison?  I might have made that up,  but I'm pretty sure  that's right.  But in Addison,  I think it's like one show  a weekend or something. 
[02:53:00]  Last time I was there,  they would have been  I'm doing that in November.  I hope not.  Double check.  Maybe they got rid of,  maybe they came to their senses.  I can't take it anymore.  It's disgusting.  What,  just the eyes?  Just burn?  I mean,  your eyes just burn out.  And you leave smelling  and it's,  and there's haze  and it's just,  if you don't smoke,  it's disgusting.  I mean,  I'm from Richmond,  Virginia,  so they passed that law.  Oh yeah.  But no one gives a shit.  Right, right.  So every bar,  they're like,  we'll pay the fucking fine.  Everybody come here  and some of it.  Oh really?  Yeah,  they just pay the fine  each night.  They don't care.  How much is the fine?  It's like 50 bucks a night.  Yeah,  it's nothing.  They don't care.  How did that even pass 
[02:53:30]  in that state?  I don't know  because it's literally  our biggest employers.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean,  we lost Circuit City,  we lost,  a bunch of big companies  went down in our city,  so really it's all  that's left is tobacco.  Wow.  Circuit City was Virginia-based.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't know that.  That was like 8,000 jobs  in our city.  There's no more Circuit Cities?  No.  No, no.  Do you think Radio Shack  is next?  No, baby.  How do they hang on?  I don't know how Radio Shack  is managed.  You're right.  It's always been the worst.  I'll tell you how  because their stores are small.  Is that it?  Yeah,  I think they have small stores.  They didn't overextend.  It's a kiosk. 
[02:54:00]  It's horrible.  There's nothing in them  that anyone wants.  Three or four employees.  Nothing that we want.  We're not their target market.  JVC and DVD players.  Bomb makers.  Does it need a fucking switch  with an LED in a box?  Yeah.  But they're always tiny stores.  That's why they never have  anything I want.  They stink.  But they're not like,  you know,  Best Buy will have  fucking 250 employees.  But you're right.  They are next.  You think Best Buy is in trouble?  They're in deep trouble.  Deep shit?  I mean,  I'll go to Best Buy  to look at the product 
[02:54:30]  and then I'll buy it on Amazon.  And then you buy it on everyone.  In the store.  I'll be in the Best Buy store  and make a purchase.  That's happening.  That's happening.  It's like 100 bucks cheaper.  I'm going to go to  the Amazon showroom.  Yeah.  I think that's what's next.  Someone will create  an Amazon showroom  that there's an item  sitting there  and then you just buy it.  Because everyone's doing that  not just for Best Buy.  These places are in trouble.  You just want to check out  the product live.  Staples were less.  Then you go home  and you fucking make a deal.  Staples, I think,  or office deep.  Staples.  It's one of those  office places. 
[02:55:00]  It's one of those stores  where you go in  and you're like,  I just need one thing  and then you're like,  I buy stuff for an office.  I don't even have an office.  And I'm like,  well, we need colored post-its  and a barrel of pretzels  for the office.  It gets you.  Or like,  I've got a pack of colored Sharpies.  A barrel of pretzels.  It's for the snack room.  Barrel of pretzels.  Snack office snacks.  You do feel compelled  to just buy things  because it's nice to have  a nice thing of paper.  I want to ream.  I need a ream of paper.  Ream someone with a ream of paper.  That's folders  with colored tabs on them.  Yeah, I'm going to redo  my filing cabinet. 
[02:55:30]  It makes you want  to get organized.  Oh, and then you never do.  I bought a thousand  coffee filters from there.  Oh, wow.  I don't have a coffee machine.  Why would you?  You don't have any employees.  I don't have...  I got a dog.  I got a dog.  My fucking drinks coffee.  My filing cabinet  has needed to be redone  for eight years.  I have taxi,  business meal,  and Valtrex.  Those are my  three fucking sections.  I need an office manager.  What else about whores?  What are we looking forward to?  Oh, man.  This season, 
[02:56:00]  the Crack Attic episode,  I'm excited to see.  I don't know what's...  That's in two weeks.  Yeah, that's two weeks.  The poop one is next week.  That 15,000...  I actually had to potty train  an adult.  That was very interesting.  Are you kidding?  I think there's something  wrong with you.  There might be.  I think it's you,  not them.  Because you're not even blinking  when you're telling us  about this stuff, man.  Yeah, there's something  wrong with you.  I know, we learned that  last time.  Matt's twisted.  Did you get that picture  I texted you?  I don't know if it went through.  Which one?  It was the worst toilet  I'd ever seen.  No.  Oh, wow.  Down the hall. 
[02:56:30]  I hope you still have it.  I do.  I got it on my phone.  I'm so glad you're  coming to my show tonight.  Wait, you had a potty train  in the first toilet  I've ever seen.  Girl I dated.  How did you potty train?  Was it with a bucket  and a whip?  Every time she got it wrong.  That's not your job, Matt.  That's not your job.  And did she get to keep  what was in the bucket after?  I gave her candy  every time that she  actually went to the bathroom.  Oh, that's sweet.  Great.  Is that an Android?  It is.  Something to shit out.  That was very smart.  I think Matt gets boners.  I know.  I have never gotten  a boner in a hoarder. 
[02:57:00]  Someone asked me,  I've never gotten  a boner in a hoarder.  Why not?  I never got a boner  in a hoarder's house.  The stuff turned you on  a little bit.  I did pee one time  in a hoarder's house.  I couldn't make it out.  I had to piss.  I would pee in a hoarder's house.  Did you go to the toilet  or did you just do it  right there?  I just pissed in the basement.  It increased the property value.  I felt so bad about it afterwards  because it was supposed  to be respectful.  I couldn't.  I was going to piss my pants  so I pissed in the corner.  And then I'm like,  holy shit,  I put my dick out  in this house.  What latched onto it.  I ended back the truck  and just started wiping  my dick off  with handy wipes 
[02:57:30]  from the chicken wing plates.  With the guy's hand.  And I don't mean  to sound disrespectful  to the family  but when else  are you going to see  a mullet?  They're not listening.  They don't own  any electronics.  Yeah.  They own 400 VCRs.  That they got at Radio Shack.  They're not going to listen to us.  And not throw one away.  Let me see this picture.  I know, I'm pulling it up.  A toilet.  I couldn't believe it.  And when you have  to potty train an adult,  what, like...  It's very difficult. 
[02:58:00]  You didn't even know  how to sit on it.  Oh, your son's what,  two?  How old's your son?  Almost two and a half.  So you're doing that right now.  The same age as my son.  We're right in it.  Yeah, we're...  We have begun.  Yeah, it's awful.  Is there a picture?  Can you see a picture  of the toilet?  Oh, yeah, here it is.  Oh, boy.  I like how I reach for it.  I'm so excited.  The phone's not dirty,  just the picture.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, it doesn't get bigger.  That's the actual toilet.  When I forwarded you  that picture  and I was like,  there's no way you got it  because I would have  gotten a bigger response.  There's a lot of duty in that.  Can I say what's interesting  about that picture  is that there's  a Pavlovian response 
[02:58:30]  where once you've used it  to keep depositing  the toilet paper in there  but it's not flushing  so there's really no point.  It's two feet above the toilet.  They have the sanity  to place it  in the proper receptacle.  It's two feet above the toilet.  That was too short.  What the fuck am I looking at?  She would have had to  stand on something  to make that pile keep going.  A Lorax.  It looks like  my bathroom  after a vegetable juice.  Nice fucking beet juice.  It looks like a volcano erupting.  It looks like  a fourth grade science project.  Why bother going  into the bathroom  at that point?  Did you tweet this?  No. 
[02:59:00]  God, no.  Why not?  Is this your Facebook picture?  Nobody wants to see that stuff.  Everybody wants to.  Send it to me.  You watch how fast  I tweet this shit.  If you tweet it,  so be it.  I'm not tweeting it.  I'll tweet it.  We'll all tweet it.  I'll tweet it to you.  Send it to you.  I'll retweet it.  I don't tweet.  I'll retweet it.  I'll favorite it.  I'll like it.  And I do, by the way,  thank you for  tweeting me.  You doubled my tweet.  Please.  I love sitting there  watching the show  and tweeting along.  It's just so much fun.  I barely watch the show anymore.  I'm just on Twitter 
[02:59:30]  during it  interacting with everybody.  It's a very interactive  Twitter show.  At Clutter Cleaner.  At Clutter Cleaner.  It is a very interactive  Twitter show.  You could watch it,  tweet.  People are just  disgusted by things.  Some funny jokes.  It's just,  it's a great thing.  I get the poll.  I call them the opposites.  I get all these  really positive posts  from all the family members.  Right.  And then you chime in.  What the fuck is this shit?  I read them too.  Your fans just,  of course,  get relentless very quickly.  Oh, they're terrible. 
[03:00:00]  It's the only time  I ever had to delete something.  When it's the most  blatantly racist shit ever.  It's just like,  ugh, I can't do this.  You know what?  I've got that too.  I've been like,  you know,  I'm trying to have  a semi-civilized debate  with somebody  on Twitter.  And then you just read  what the listener's doing.  It's like,  oh, is that what  you're bringing this down to?  Really?  I mean,  how many of them are just,  how many of you guys,  you've got a million fans.  How many of them  are just total assholes?  A hundred percent.  Is it?  Is it a hundred percent?  It's way up there.  As far as the Twitters go, 
[03:00:30]  wow.  It's way up there.  There's a lot.  Unfortunately.  There's a lot.  I think your fans are nice.  Aren't they amazing?  I've done a lot of podcasts.  Because you're a girl.  No, but it's very,  no, it's very easy for people.  They like girls.  Most people don't.  Your fans are very nice to me.  I've done podcasts  where people are like,  oh, she's just mean things  for no reason.  And your fans have always  been very cool.  Really mean things?  What could they possibly say?  Like the C word for no reason.  That's not nice.  There's no reason.  Is there ever really no reason  to call a girl on that?  Come on.  I'm involved.  Let's be honest with each other.  I'm involved.  But I like your fans. 
[03:01:00]  That's good.  They'll love that.  They're going to do nothing  but tweet you now.  With the C word?  No, with the cock pics.  Whatever.  Great.  There you go.  Now that Anne suggested it.  My mom just texted me  and she said,  horse zits,  women with penises in their mouths.  Really, Eliza?  She's listening?  She's upset now.  Why would she listen?  What would she like us  to talk about?  No.  Text her back.  I want to know what she wants.  She's hearing it.  Huh?  She can hear it.  She can just text her.  All right, yeah.  What would you like us  to talk about?  Madam Schlesinger,  what would you like us 
[03:01:30]  to discuss with your daughter?  I shouldn't have brought it up.  That's okay.  I want to see what her suggestion is.  That'd be nice.  Parents intermittently  know how to use texting.  It comes and it goes.  Oh, yeah.  All right, let me ask you.  Do you only date white guys?  I have only dated white guys.  Okay, cool.  Met that on the radio.  White gate.  Oh, it's on?  Oh, sorry.  Have you ever slept with a black guy?  No.  I'm just trying to think  of what mom would want to hear.  Not bad.  Wow.  How do you deal with your mom?  We didn't sleep.  Comedy's not the cleanest 
[03:02:00]  of comedy in the world.  It's pretty clean.  How do you deal with your mom?  My grandma is on Facebook now  and that has created  a really big issue.  Yeah, the grandma's got to  get off the fucking Facebook.  I got called by A&E.  That's happening to everybody now.  A&E called me and said,  you got to get your grandma  on to stop posting  about the show.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  Because she just,  I'm her boy  and she kind of raised me  and she gets very defensive  and so if someone says,  you're an asshole,  my grandson's not an asshole.  He saves lives.  He's a really good guy.  She'll individually,  and she'll spend all day.  Did you have a talk with her?  I was like,  Nanny, you can't do this.  This isn't appropriate.  And she's like,  what do you mean I can't do it? 
[03:02:30]  And she still doesn't get technology  so her message...  She's hoarding postings.  Her message is my aunt's name  because she went to look up my aunt  and she did it in the message thing  instead of the search  and then she never changed it.  So her message for two years  has been my aunt's first name.  But then she just goes on  and defends me  and then I have like this,  I sell a,  I'm trying to make some money  because I'm on reality TV.  We made a poop,  a golden poop Christmas ornament.  So it's like a,  you make those brass college ornaments,  you know,  it's that,  but it's a big pile of poop. 
[03:03:00]  Well, at least you're taking  the whole thing seriously.  I know.  14.95, man.  Deep psychological problems  and he's selling fucking poop  for your Christmas tree.  We sold a bunch.  My grandma was devastated  and she's so,  she's like,  you're going to be broke.  How can you raise a family  on poop ornaments?  And like,  she gets so,  I'm like,  it's a joke,  it's a gag.  We're only selling a thousand.  Relax.  She sounds like she has  a great sense of humor.  She's a pretty funny lady.  How do you tell your family  to show up?  Tell nanny to lighten up.  How do you tell your family  to, you know.  I can't imagine.  I mean,  you're obviously more high profile 
[03:03:30]  than me.  I'm very famous.  Watch out.  My mother cried.  My mother cried,  I told you,  when she heard something  I said on the show.  Oh, no.  I was joking a couple years ago.  Your grandma?  My mother.  Oh, your mother.  I was literally kidding.  We were talking,  we were talking about guys  who are too attached  to their mothers  and how awful that is.  And I was joking  and I said like,  I don't know how my dad fucks her.  But I was kidding.  Oh, no.  And she was like,  why would you say that?  I'm like,  mom, I was joking.  Oh, man.  In the context of  sons that are too attached 
[03:04:00]  to their mother,  you know,  sometimes you say things  and they get like.  Did you feel bad?  No,  because I knew how,  I felt bad that she felt bad.  But I didn't feel bad  that I said it  because I remember  the context in which  it was said.  Oh, I didn't mean  feel bad about saying it,  but just, you know,  any dumb thing  that sets them off  and they start crying  and you're just like,  oh, God.  Oh, that, of course.  My wife calls that  a Paxton apology.  I say,  I'm sorry that what I said  upset you.  I'm not sorry  that I said it.  I'm sorry it upset you.  I'm sorry that you're  so weak that it upset you.  It's good when people  fall for that  because then you feel  like you didn't give 
[03:04:30]  an apology  and they feel good.  That they were apologized to.  Yeah, meanwhile,  it's like,  I'm sorry you're so fragile.  I'm sorry you have  no sense of humor.  There's plenty of apologies  that mean nothing.  I'm sorry there's no humor  in your life.  I have to pee badly.  Do you?  You want to take a little break?  I really have to do that.  Yeah, we could like  wrap up next.  What the hell?  All right.  We'll do that then.  All right.  And be right back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thanks for calling

After hearing  50 Shades of Gay,  I would totally  be down for tasting  someone else's  or whatever.  I'm a quivering,  moist mess  and he hasn't  even touched me.  I've always been  a guy that's like  totally into chicks  with tits  and stuff like that  but you know what?  This book is  freaking hot as shit. 
[03:08:00]  Holy fuck,  this is wrong  but holy hell  is it erotic.  For the first time,  I'm sexually attracted  to something that  isn't available  at the deli counter.  My insides  practically contort  with potent  needy liquid desire.  I don't fuck guys,  man,  but I'll jack off  to this, man.  Damn!  The experts agree  50 Shades of Gay  is a must listen.  Hello,  I'm Dr. Gay.  This audio book  is a must listen  for any man 
[03:08:30]  looking to further  a healthy sex life.  I'm erect.  50 Shades of Gay.  If you're not  turned on now,  you will be.  Yum.  Sirius XM  XM  This  is the  O.P. and Anthony Show.  That's so sweet.  I had no idea.  Pretty much wrapping up  for the day  in a few minutes here.  Eliza Schlesinger  in studio.  Gotham's  Gotham Comedy Club 
[03:09:00]  tonight through  Saturday.  Very,  very funny  comic.  Very,  very funny  female comic.  She's very pretty too.  Giving her all these  compliments  if she's not even listening.  She's a pretty girl.  Thank you.  And you're a pretty girl.  Thank you.  You got a boyfriend?  You hear that, Mom?  I don't have a boyfriend.  Why?  What's the issue?  What's the problem?  Sometimes you don't have  a boyfriend.  I had one.  I would say she's funnier  than she is good looking.  Whoa,  that's a compliment.  That's a good compliment  right there.  I should do the girl thing  and be like,  so what does that mean? 
[03:09:30]  You just called me fat.  You just called me fat  subliminally.  I heard it.  I did.  So are my thighs funny?  Is that what you're saying?  Well,  I do have fat thighs.  No,  do you?  Yes.  It's got to go somewhere.  So what happened  with the boyfriend?  I had one  and now I don't.  What happened?  He lived far away.  It was just not going to happen.  How long were you going out?  About a year.  Is that a long time for you?  That's the standard.  We do it.  We go a year  and then we end it.  You get a lease?  Who ended it?  It was mutual.  He lived very far away.  It could be mutual 
[03:10:00]  when it's done  but someone usually initiates.  You don't both open the door  and go at the same time  let's break up.  Oh,  hey,  oh me,  it was in the ether.  We'll put it that way.  Yeah,  yeah.  How far away did he live?  A constant pissed mist.  Virginia.  That's him.  And then he's moving to Dubai  for his job  so that's pretty far.  Who is he?  Fucking work for Al-Qaeda?  Yes.  He worked for the Mossad.  His parents hated  that he dated a Jew  but we made it.  We were like Romeo and Juliet.  Yeah.  So that means  I'll be dying shortly. 
[03:10:30]  How long have you been single?  Six months.  Oh,  okay.  Aw.  Do you date?  I've been on,  not a lot  but I've been on some dates.  Were they stupid?  No.  They were fun?  I dated one guy  we went on five dates.  I have this thing  where I like to  get drunk with guys  and then I say up front  I'm not going to sleep with you  but you can sleep over  and they never have an issue with it  and we make out and go to bed.  Wow,  that sounds  awful.  Do they at least jerk off?  That sounds awful.  No.  I've never had a guy  have an issue with this  and they call me the next day  and we go out  and it's not  some men aren't pigs. 
[03:11:00]  And you can buy me breasts.  Some men aren't pigs.  Some aren't.  I'll tell you why that works though  because you know  you're going to get to kiss  a little bit  and she's not being a cock tease  because she's telling you in advance.  Thank you.  Come over  and I'd like to have you  because I'm enjoying you  but I won't fuck yet.  You can see me in my underwear  and it'll be great.  Yeah,  that's actually not bad.  Thank you.  But I would scrap on the floor  though when she dozed off.  Oh my God.  What a scrap.  A load.  I would just turn the other way  and fucking play on how I...  Let me ask you this.  You ever break up...  I mean,  you're married, right?  No.  Okay.  You ever break up with someone  for something they didn't do  but you think they're going to do? 
[03:11:30]  Here's what it is.  This guy told me  he liked horseback riding.  Yeah.  Which is fine.  Where you get a horse in LA,  I don't know.  Like horseback riding.  Instead of sex in the city.  Right?  I couldn't get the image  and this is not anything I'd seen  of him in riding boots  and like a Victorian white flowy shirt  horseback riding down the beach.  So I had to break it off.  Wow.  Because I couldn't have that image  and be attracted to him.  Yeah.  As great as he was.  As attractive as he was.  That makes sense.  It really messed with me.  So don't tell me about  your extracurricular activities 
[03:12:00]  if you want to keep it going.  Well,  if that bothers me,  I can't wait till she hears  2,000 tranny stories.  I want to ask her out  just to tell her tranny stories.  I can't get that image  out of my head  of you enjoying that  and paying for it.  It just seems more natural  than the horse.  A girl in her panties though  like in the house.  There is something  about that.  It's very hot  but the thing is like,  yeah,  it's,  I mean,  it would,  like panties.  In her house?  Is that what you said?  Yeah,  like you're in,  like if you're hanging out  and you said you get  to see me in my panties.  Right.  Like that would just be panties. 
[03:12:30]  Panties.  Her little jiggly hiney  in the panties  like walking around.  That'd be like,  mom's listening.  We're drunk  and in bed at this point.  There's no walking around.  So now you're sleeping  in the same bed.  Yeah.  But there's no shenanigans  going on.  I've slept in a bed  with a lot of my guy friends too.  It's an unhealthy relationship  I establish right off the bat.  No shit.  Just be like,  hey,  you're drunk,  yeah,  just sleep over.  Do you ever wake up  with him like just maybe  pushing a little on you?  Never happened.  You're a sound sleeper.  A little,  all of a sudden he's, 
[03:13:00]  like he's laying down in bed,  his head's on the pillow  away from you,  his feet are away from you,  but he's like arched  real close to you  in the midsection.  He's like doing  a bending over backwards thing.  I think there's something  wrong with me.  I shouldn't sleep over.  I will say this,  but the acknowledgement  from the beginning  would make a huge difference.  Thank you.  Because any other guy's  going to be like,  you're saying there's a chance  like all the way  until three or four in the morning,  you're hanging on,  thinking it's going to happen,  but you let it know  at like 10 o'clock,  I'll just get wasted.  And I think it goes both ways.  Especially if a girl,  if she sleeps with a guy, 
[03:13:30]  let's say it's a one night stand  or whatever,  if you know going into it  that he's a degenerate  that's not going to ever date you,  but it's going to be  a great one night.  I think you can wake up  feeling good about that  versus being like,  yeah, I'd love to hang out  some more  and then they don't call.  That's the issue.  But then now,  so does it go like  maybe a couple of dates  and this whole pattern happens  and then someday  he just wins the lottery  and it's like,  hey, guess what?  We're going to do it.  You're in.  If we're sleeping together,  you're probably my boyfriend  at this point.  That's just the way I roll.  Oh, look at you. 
[03:14:00]  I just checked my Twitter.  See, Mom?  A guy goes,  who's the chick  and is she hot?  What are you going to say?  What are you going to say?  It's Eliza Schlesinger  and she is hot.  What is your Twitter name?  Gotham Comedy Club  tonight through Saturday.  Yes.  What is your...  Oh, yeah,  we went over this last time.  You got Eliza.  I-L-I-Z-A.  L-L-I-Z-A.  I-L-I-Z-A.  She got it.  I-L-I-Z-A.  Wow.  I tweeted you guys all yesterday.  That's a pretty good one.  I'm going to do it all right now. 
[03:14:30]  That's a good Twitter right there.  I feel dirty  because I just Instagrammed  a toilet shot.  I don't think Instagram  was made for that.  Oh, it totally was.  You think?  Did you use filters?  Do you use the shit filter?  I went with the brown filter.  I went with Kelvin.  I have no, like,  moles or anything.  And I feel like it's awful  to tweet that.  I'm not tweeting it.  You Instagram it?  No.  Oh, you can't.  I just talked about  picking up a guy's scalp.  I finally figured out what you...  I think that's horrible  to do what you just did.  I finally figured out  how to use the Kelvin filter.  You used the Kelvin filter 
[03:15:00]  for shit.  I've never used Kelvin before.  You got it.  Of course you do.  You used the drama settings  for piss.  That's a gross picture there, Matt Paxton.  Clutter Cleaner on Twitter.  That's a good one.  Matt was telling me  he's got all sorts of things  going on after  Horrors X.  Oh, yeah.  Whenever that does,  by the way.  You got podcasts.  A lot of podcasts.  Five Decisions Away.  Five Decisions Away, yeah.  Great podcast.  You ever find one of these  in a hoarder's house?  A Blackberry?  No.  Don't want that fucking thing.  This is the best.  It stinks.  Wait, I'm sorry.  This is the best.  This is from a guy... 
[03:15:30]  Is this a phone holster, Dad?  I know.  I will acknowledge  Eliza's point.  My phone case  is horrendous.  It's black with white stitching.  Did you get Kenneth Cole?  It's indefensible.  It really is.  He says Sprint PCS.  I keep it only  because it protects  my phone when I fall,  but I will acknowledge...  My phone?  No, wait, wait, wait.  When I fall,  you just get worse.  It works.  Yes.  Yes.  It actually,  it catches my nitroglycerin.  My equilibrium is so... 
[03:16:00]  I fall all the time.  It has a magnet  that sticks to my oxygen tank.  When I drop my phone.  That's funny.  I don't need to justify  the Blackberry.  I can out-text you  any day of the week.  Most people can.  Okay, fine.  And it doesn't...  Okay, the internet is bad,  but it's good for texting.  But Blackberry sucked.  I mean, I had one.  They're terrible.  They're a terrible company.  I'll stand for a horse zit,  but not this.  I was a Blackberry guy  for many years.  I had to give up.  What about pictures?  I had to give up on it.  What about pictures?  Sometimes it gets pictures.  Oh, no. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, so you know.  I can get a picture  if I go to a hotspot  and I wait for the data to load.  Sounds easy.  I can get a picture  if someone...  Sounds great.  I stand very close  to a cell phone tower.  And what kind of camera  you got on that thing?  An M32 megapixel.  I don't know.  What kind of camera?  What kind of question?  I don't know.  That's a dumb question.  There's a camera.  There is a camera.  People pick on me  for the Blackberry.  I think I'm going to call  my hour special  I'm keeping my Blackberry.  That's the whole background  is going to be a Blackberry.  Kind of nice.  I love it. 
[03:17:00]  I do it to be contrarian,  quite frankly.  It's over, Johnny.  No.  I actually thought  they were out of business.  I didn't know  they were out of business.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not joking, for real.  I don't like you.  Where do you get parts  for that thing?  At a Radio Shack.  She's got a soldering iron  and some resistors.  I take it to a Middle Eastern guy  down the street  and he does it for me.  Yeah, I was listening  to your text.  I was like,  again, I used to love Blackberry.  That storm,  I still wake up sometimes  hating them for the storm.  Which one was the storm? 
[03:17:30]  Well, it was the one  that was going to bring it  back on the map.  20 after that one.  This is the most recent one.  Oh, it is?  Is it?  And they still got the buttons.  Our people like to feel  the buttons.  We do.  It's a tactile experience.  It's an interactive experience.  Like two days ago?  Yeah, we were just saying.  We like the tactile experience.  It's important.  I can text the whole thing  without looking,  whereas you have predictive text  and it's stupid.  You have a stupid phone,  Jim Norton.  So I could just talk into it.  Oh, yeah.  You have me there.  I could just say, 
[03:18:00]  I could just say,  I hit the fucking Siri button.  What about reveling  in the experience  of a technological evolution?  What about enjoying  one of the steps  of an evolution  versus just skipping ahead  to the next best thing?  I've had that.  What about nostalgia?  By the way,  if you're sleeping with a girl  in bed,  we also enjoy  the tactile experience.  Well, when I'm sleeping,  it's all yours.  Yeah.  How rude is that?  The sleeping girl feel up.  Hey, what's the matter? 
[03:18:30]  Hey, look,  if you're dumb enough  to doze off,  I'm going to pull the covers back  and give your hiney  one of these.  Ooh.  Dumb enough to doze off.  I'm sleeping with a crocodile.  Hey, what do you expect?  Can I just say that you're,  I know you acknowledge  because of the falling  that it's awful.  That's a deal breaker.  Wow.  That's a deal breaker.  If you pull out the holster phone.  If you have a holster  and you're like a young,  cool guy  and that's what you have,  that's a deal breaker.  But I'll tell you one thing,  if the fucking holster  didn't get you,  the pictures I have on here  would be a deal breaker.  Of all the things  that are Jim Norton, 
[03:19:00]  the cell phone holder  is the thing that throws you off.  No, do you know what it is?  It's like,  this used to be,  I used to wear this  on the outside of the belt.  Oh, you'd wear it.  No, but it's so,  no, no, no, I mean,  I'm sorry, no,  on the inside of my,  here, here's why.  On the inside of my pocket,  and I shouldn't  because it's going to be  ball cancer.  Your insulin pump  for when you fall.  But you keep it like that.  And it keeps it from  falling all the way  into your pocket.  So you,  I would wear it backwards  like that.  Oh, sweet, Dad.  What else?  What are the other ergonomics  of a Blackberry case?  I love it.  I hate it.  Yeah.  Oh my God. 
[03:19:30]  I will acknowledge  it's indefensible.  Yeah, it is bad.  The best part,  when I fall down.  Yeah.  I need it for when I fall down.  Sometimes Grandpa  takes a tumble.  No, no young woman  wants to hear that.  No.  When I fall down.  Yeah, I need a new case.  It does have white stitching on it.  I got a guy.  I need a case.  He's going to have a new one  tomorrow morning.  He will have a new one.  It looks like a Skechers shoe.  It looks like a Skechers shoe.  I'm going to turn this thing  on in the morning.  You're going to be talking  about the new case  that you bought.  Of course you will. 
[03:20:00]  Tough skin pants.  And I'll be complaining  about my fucking...  Look how cool my case is  and it's rubber.  Yeah, but look what it's protecting.  Why would you have that?  My memories?  I'd be more worried  about the case  if I drop this.  Not only is he going  to be talking about the case,  he's going to have  about ten of them  in here tomorrow.  I'm going to try new ones.  He's going to try them all out.  Yeah, I have to.  Why don't you put it  on like a string,  like a yo-yo retractable  janitor string,  and it just kind of hovers?  One of my favorite things now  is when you and Bob Kelly  get in technology bites.  Oh, yeah.  I fucking love it.  I love it.  I love Bobby.  What does he have?  Bobby has everything.  No intelligence whatsoever. 
[03:20:30]  He continues to just...  He has whatever his idea is  and he goes with it.  The new apps for the iPhone,  dude, you got hit boom,  you get your coffee,  you're replaying games,  you got maps.  Dude, you got to be positive.  Yeah.  You got to be positive.  Positive.  Jesus Christ.  Bob's here tomorrow.  Is he?  As is Frank Oz  and Anthony Bourdain.  Wow.  That's a good one.  That's awesome.  You guys picked  the wrong day to come in.  Oh, man.  It's pretty much the insult  of each other saying 
[03:21:00]  you picked a bad day.  I'd be upset  if I was with the guy  that cleaned up shit on TV.  I liked it.  Why?  You're with people  who produce it on radio every day?  Yeah, clean up this mask.  Good luck.  Good luck cleaning up this shit hole.  I want to...  I'm looking forward  to meeting Frank Oz.  Frank, yeah, that'd be cool.  He's a legend, as they say.  So we should go home  and get plenty of rest  from Frank Oz interview.  I guess that's it.  What is he promoting?  Get the fuck out of here.  The 25th anniversary  of Little Shop of Horrors.  Little Shop.  Oh, the Little Shop of Horrors guy. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, and here's what we got to do.  I was thinking it was Dr. Oz  and I was like,  why is he promoting it?  I'm sorry.  Dr. Oz?  I'm sorry.  I blanked out.  That'd be terrible.  He's not paying attention.  Just undermine everything I've done here.  That guy moves some product, man.  Oh, my God.  It's crazy.  Those housewives love him.  I got to hang out with Montel the other day  and he was telling me...  Montel Williams?  Oh, my God, dude.  Was he talking smack about him?  No, he loves...  That's like the main show he does now  because Montel makes all his money  selling like blenders and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  He got me on a juice die, man.  I've lost 15 pounds  because of that juice die.  Really?  Yeah, that's legit.  Is that yours?  Yeah, I mean,  I do like my own home air  and I got it. 
[03:22:00]  I have an issue with juice.  Homemade juice  that he got me making  on his little blender.  It's awesome, though.  So you watched the infomercial?  Yeah.  The infomercial.  Oh, okay.  I thought you had an actual conversation.  He's actually reached out to me  and helped me.  He actually got me a product line.  I'm going to ask him  next time I see him in the elevator.  He's got me a whole line  of cleaning products.  He lives in my building.  You want me to ask him?  Oh, does he?  Do you call Dr. Oz or Mamet?  No, he's not approachable.  He's a dick.  He looks like a dick.  Really?  He's a dick.  He looks like a dick.  He's really not approachable. 
[03:22:30]  Look at all these people  just bad-mouthing someone  you don't even know.  Hey, he lives in my building.  I know.  He's a dick.  Yeah.  I could say it.  He doesn't look like a nice guy.  He's not a nice guy.  He thinks he's all that.  Does he leave his junk mail  on the floor by the mailboxes?  Oh, bastards.  Oh, he's not one of those guys.  Oh, he's not one of those.  He's a dick.  Hey, Dr. Oz, I have a question.  What the fuck?  I ran out of steam on that.  But I was going to insult him, basically.  I was going to be insulting Dr. Oz.  Jimmy, tell me about Helium,  the second show,  so we can get out of here.  Yes.  Let's go home. 
[03:23:00]  I have October 25, 26, 27,  and they've added a second show  on the Thursday  because the show's  is selling very well.  The Thursday.  And I also have,  I wanted to plug Vegas,  which is, I think,  October fucking the 19th.  I don't remember.  I should probably know that  ahead of time.  All right.  ClutterCleaner on Twitter.  We know that, Matt.  ClutterCleaner.  We're going to get some followers today.  They're loving the toilet pick,  and I think that's going to get you  some followers today.  Sorry. 
[03:23:30]  Sorry, Grandma.  That's great.  Toilet pick gets you followers.  And the podcast.  Wonderful world.  How do they find the podcast?  People love your podcast.  Stitcher or iTunes,  or you can go right to  5DecisionsAway.com.  Cool, man.  And Eliza, of course.  Matt and Eliza.  No.  We'll be at Gotham this weekend.  Can we say that?  You can watch my dating show,  Excused.  Excused?  We just wrapped 230 episodes.  Jesus.  Wow, that's great.  Really?  Yeah.  A lot of episodes.  Yeah.  So, second season is currently airing.  Yeah.  Check your local listings.  You can go to ExcusedTV.com.  Our website looks like an ad 
[03:24:00]  for Herbal Viagra.  Nice.  I'll show it to you.  You'll see what I mean.  Hoarders, Monday nights.  Yes, yes, of course.  Please.  And possibly on the show tomorrow.  I met Oz.  Katie Sunshine.  Oh, wait.  Hula hoop girl.  Wait, wait.  By phone?  Son of a bitch.  Ah, by phone?  I want her hula hooping in here.  She's married.  Is she?  Yeah.  She's in Arkansas.  How do you know?  Because I know her full name now.  Oh, damn.  Creep.  You are a goddamn ghoul, Jimmy.  I like to learn things.  It's all over the internet. 
[03:24:30]  It's not a secret.  I'm just joking.  It's not a secret.  Yeah.  All right, y'all.  Thanks for having us.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next.  Yes, yes, yes. 
[03:25:00]  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Matt Paxton on his way out just said,  I listen to your show more than I used to.  I don't know if that's a compliment or not.  There's these weird backhanded compliments with Sam Roberts.  It's like, oh, I always thought you were complete shit.  Now you're actually something I can grin and bear it through.  It's embarrassing.  I mean, I guess from Matt Paxton, it's also very weird. 
[03:25:30]  Whenever any person of notoriety says they listen to the after show,  it makes me question everything I say.  Except for you, Jim.  Eliza left, too?  Yep, Eliza left.  Matt Paxton and Opie and Anthony are right outside.  What's Don Wickland doing out there?  I don't know.  I said hello to him.  It was good to see him.  Don Wickland was the 57th Street version of Gary.  He wanted all of us, but stupid E-Rock messed that up, too.  E-Rock's messing up out there?  Real fast, he wants all of us.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  He's such a rock. 
[03:26:00]  He only took Jim, and then I look stupid in the background  because I thought I was supposed to be in the picture.  Why does E-Rock always make Opie look stupid?  Poor guy.  It's a big show today.  Eliza Schlesinger, who's going to be at Gotham Comedy Club this weekend.  You can go to GothamComedyClub.com.  It's here in New York.  Tonight through Saturday, she's very, very funny.  She's on the show Excused.  I've seen it a couple times.  That's one of those shows that you end up seeing late at night,  like when you're in hotel rooms because it's on at odd times. 
[03:26:30]  Eliza's dating show.  It's a horrible website.  It's a terrible website.  She was showing us during the commercial break just now.  It's ExcusedTV.com.  But the website, I mean, it's no surprise that she didn't promote it  because it's awful.  But at least she's got a TV show.  She's a good guest.  Yeah, she's very good.  She's honest.  Yeah.  I don't know about that thing she was talking about, though,  when she tells guys, I'm not going to fuck you, but you can come over.  And you get to make out with her, and she's walking around in panties or whatever. 
[03:27:00]  I'd be okay with that.  See, I would still, I'd be like, okay, you say we're not going to fuck,  but I bet we will.  And so it's like I wouldn't be able to process that we're definitely not going to.  Well, I don't have, I don't like the pressure of fucking right away anyway.  You don't?  I thought that was your whole, Sal.  No.  Sal is laughing at you farting, Jim, as if it's not something you do nine times a day.  Old papete hair.  I don't like to, no, I don't like to fucking me.  I like to fool around, but I don't want to stick my dick right in. 
[03:27:30]  How come?  I just don't.  I'm not comfortable enough.  It's so weird, because somebody who enjoys prostitutes so much.  That's the beauty of me.  Prostitutes are different, though.  It's a different mentality.  You're a complex person.  No, I'm just a complete pervert.  Well, what do you enjoy more, then?  Do you enjoy, you know, the chase?  Do you enjoy meeting somebody and going a little more slowly with them?  How can they say this clean?  Yeah.  Eating a cunt and fucking their face.  You like that very much.  Yeah, no, I try and do a little oral sex or whatever.  But what do you, I'm saying, what do you, I didn't mean, let me finish. 
[03:28:00]  I'm asking what sexual act you enjoy more.  I meant, do you enjoy a prostitute or like a girlfriend?  I was going to say a girlfriend experience, but that's another prostitution term.  Yeah, it's just GFE, Sam.  It depends, honestly.  You know, if you're with a girl who you went on a date with, sometimes I want it to be sexual.  But I'm telling you, I've met a lot of women recently.  And I'm not fucking any of them.  And just gone out to dinner and done a bunch of dinners and stuff.  And a lot of them are very nice. 
[03:28:30]  But, especially women who are over like 30, 33.  Yeah.  You're unrealistic.  Are you dating women who are like...  I've gone out with a few and it's like, or I've talked to a few and not even wound up going out with them.  And it's like, do you really think you're fucking hot enough to not send a photo?  Like, almost like, do you understand what 22-year-old girls will do?  And they don't.  I mean, that's the difference.  Because, like, even when I was in high school, nobody was sending out pictures of themselves.  I was like, like, when there was a naked...  There was like, once a naked picture of a girl in school started circulating because she had taken pictures or whatever. 
[03:29:00]  And it was like the most embarrassing thing that could have ever happened to her.  She was traumatized.  But now, I mean, there isn't a girl with a cell phone who hasn't sent pictures of her tits.  No, I know.  And it's like, when they won't do that or when they won't do anything, I get bored extremely quickly.  And that's part of me being addictive and creepy.  But part of it is in this, things are changing.  And you get very used to people being open.  And if you can't turn me on while I'm talking to you through text... 
[03:29:30]  And I don't mean it always has to be that.  You can be regular, too.  But anyone who can't be sexy during a text message, I have no desire to fuck because you're not going to be able to turn me on.  Well, I'll just show you that in person.  Boo!  Fucking boo!  I gotta give you something to wait for.  Exactly.  The next girl is your fucking finish.  So for you, it's not about building that expectation.  No, and that can be okay, too.  But it's almost like, so many of them don't understand.  It's like, if you're dirty, and you're good and dirty, it makes me want to fuck you so much more. 
[03:30:00]  It makes me so much more anxious to see you.  Is it more difficult for you, though?  Because, like, for normal guys, it's kind of, we're used to the idea of we have to work for it a little bit.  Like, whereas you are in a position where, depending on who you choose, you don't necessarily have to work for it.  You're a successful comedian who's on television.  There are girls who will voluntarily throw themselves in.  Well, it's not even being on TV or anything.  All it is is they listen to the radio show. 
[03:30:30]  So the most of the women I meet are familiar with what I like.  So I just, what I've been able to do is just kind of, it's kind of like throw my fucking antenna up a little higher than a lot of people can.  Yeah.  So I just kind of weed out people who are like-minded.  So the 80% or 90% of women who might like me, who now don't because they know me or know about me, the 10% who do go, hey, these guys, I'd fuck them.  And they will immediately go over to you and approach you.  Yeah, but if I was a little bit less sexually driven or less like that, I'd probably have a lot more women that are willing to go out with me. 
[03:31:00]  Because you could hide your proclivities, at first at least.  What's going on over there?  Roland's just writing something down.  You can't say it on the air?  No.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Are you excited?  So I heard at the end of the show, have you been talking to Hula Hoop Girl that we've been talking about on YouTube?  Oh, okay.  Because I didn't know from that impression, but I guess she's calling in tomorrow. 
[03:31:30]  Do they have someone?  Not yet, I think.  Well, can you tell him I would love to?  Okay.  Yeah, but he's not doing it.  Who?  Some other guy.  Oh.  Sorry, guys.  Roland's writing something down.  I can't say it on the air.  Okay.  Roland's delivering secret messages.  This is Roland's job.  It's just juggling.  He's got to juggle out.  This is why he gets stressed out so much.  Because he's got to make sure the right people get the right information.  Tom, I would love to do it if they'll let me do it.  This is something Jim appears to be excited about. 
[03:32:00]  Yep.  Yeah.  So, Roland.  Yeah.  Who is the girl tomorrow?  I don't know.  She emailed me last night, and apparently she emailed Danny, too.  So, just got to figure it out, because we have a busy show tomorrow.  Who's in tomorrow?  Frank Oz.  Yeah, I like her.  We could talk to her on Monday.  Frank Oz, Anthony Bourdain, and of course, our own Bob Kelly is here.  He's doing a stress factory.  And then Caliendo might stop by.  I don't know.  Frank Caliendo might stop by, too.  Which means John Madden might stop by, and George Bush might stop by.  Pacino.  Pacino, Leno.  Yeah.  That's a lot of guests.  Robin Williams.  Eric. 
[03:32:30]  Eric Nagel?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't get an impression.  Frank Oz is promoting the Little Shop of Horrors Blu-ray.  Yes.  People forget that he's associated with that movie.  Yes.  He's so closely associated with the puppet work.  He did the voice of Yoda.  He did Fozzie Bear, didn't he?  Yeah.  I forgot he did Yoda.  Yeah.  Like Miss Piggy.  Yeah, Muppets.  Travis was telling me that he either read or watched an interview with him, and he does  not do voices.  Like if you say, you know, hey, what does Yoda sound like? 
[03:33:00]  Which, I mean, would be a douchey thing to do.  So what if Yoda was here today?  Like, who do you think Yoda would vote for in the election?  Right.  Shut up.  But, yeah, he'd be a lot douchier if he did come in here doing the voices.  I want to ask him about the film, I have to remember the name of it, Edward Norton, De  Niro, and Brando, because there were rumors circulating.  It's called The Heist or something?  Or no, The Job. 
[03:33:30]  I forget what it was.  It was about a robbery.  It wasn't The Italian Job.  No.  No, no, no.  It might have been The Heist.  Edward Norton was in that, though, right?  Yeah, but Marlon Brando was in something.  Oh, Marlon Brando.  And I heard rumors that Brando would not let Frank Oz direct him.  Really?  The score?  The score.  Thank you, Iraq.  It was so, and that he had to have De Niro direct him.  So I'd love to ask him.  I hope he doesn't blow that, well, you know, everything was fun.  They were lovely.  I hope he tells the truth about that, if it's true.  I love Marlon Brando stories.  I love, it's all I want to, if this radio show changed from the name of Opie and Anthony 
[03:34:00]  to Brando stories, I'd still love to be on it for four hours just listening to stories  about that.  My dad has a check by Marlon Brando that he signed, went to his restaurant.  Really?  Yeah, before years of, I mean, when I was a little kid.  Yeah.  He used to go there and eat.  He kept it.  Yeah, he still has it.  I just showed Jess Apocalypse Now for the first time, like, a couple weeks ago, and then  I just started getting into a kick about reading all about it and everything that went  wrong and how Brando.  Hearts of Darkness, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And how Brando showed up too fat to film the movie the way it was scripted, so they were just 
[03:34:30]  changing everything.  The whole ending had to be scrapped.  And he wouldn't even let them, because Brando, because Coppola, who did The Godfather, kind  of brought Brando back from a big hiatus.  Like, he wasn't doing great in the late 60s or whatever, he didn't have much going on,  and the studio did not want him for The Godfather.  That was Coppola, and he kind of resuscitated Brando's career, and then Brando was kind of  a dick 10 years later doing Apocalypse, and he wouldn't, like, they would say, like, we  could make it Colonel Kurtz is big and fat now, but it's because he's living so well. 
[03:35:00]  He's like this king, and he's abused himself.  You know, they were trying to find a way to spin it, but Brando was like, no, so they  shot him in the shadows.  You could tell, though.  Yeah.  Like, when he was lying down or when he was standing up or whatever.  But I still loved it.  I loved that weird dialogue with him and Martin Sheen.  Which, like, just all of it?  Loved it.  Yeah.  Even though the critics hated it, and Brando still got top billing in the movie, I love  the fact that he was just sitting there in the dark.  I thought it was good, too.  I mean, there was part of me that was realizing, because that was around the time when he started, 
[03:35:30]  or at least rumored, I don't know if it's true or not, didn't he have an earpiece in  that they were feeding him his little lines?  I don't think for Apocalypse Now.  It was on the YouTube for the one with that.  Or was that the Island of Dr. Monroe?  Yeah, that was the only one he did that for.  He might have done it for more.  His assistant, and that was, he was, yeah, being fed his lines, which I love.  I really liked him in that movie.  I was like, because it's such a workup to when you finally meet him.  I think it pays off.  Yeah, I love the line.  They teach young men to drop fire on people, but they won't allow them to write fuck on 
[03:36:00]  their airplanes because it is obscene.  There's some great lines in that movie.  Yeah, and he does it so weird.  You're right.  He just, he just, the dialogue is so strange.  Like, his choices, it seems like he's just kind of fucking around.  Yeah, but he had, he just was so effortless.  Yeah.  Like, literally, when he was doing The Godfather, when you see, like, shots from behind the  scenes, there's dialogue on the cabinets.  There were stories of times where he would do his close-ups, and the person he was doing 
[03:36:30]  his close-up with would have his lines on their forehead.  He taped, or taped to them.  And he would just make, of all the objectifying things you could do to somebody, just to make  your co-star put a post-it on their forehead.  He doesn't give a fuck.  No, he didn't give a fuck.  He's Marlon Brando.  He really didn't care, and that's, there's something so great about that, and he was so  comfortable.  I wish I was talented enough at anything to be like, this is how I do it, and just do it  in the most obscene, obscure way, that was just completely against everybody else associated  with the project, and be able to say, if you don't like it, then don't use me. 
[03:37:00]  I don't care.  Yeah, they said that's why he rubbed his chin in one scene, because he's trying to stare  at the lines.  Really?  Yeah.  Godfather?  No, the Island of Dr. Moreau, where he just took a pause and rubbed his chin.  They said that he was reading the lines and saying that his head.  That was his last movie, right?  Yeah.  The Island of Dr. Moreau.  That's when he was really just finished.  There was a weird thing he did, too, in Don Juan DeMarco, I liked, with Johnny Depp.  Yeah, yeah.  And Brando played the psychiatrist, and he was obviously obese in that.  But I think we've talked about it on the other day, but there was one scene where the 
[03:37:30]  other doctor is telling him, he's got to be institutionalized, and Brando's saying no.  And the guy stands up and walks away, and Brando says, I'm very pissed off at you.  And that's how he says it.  And I'm like, any other actor in the world would have said that.  I'm very pissed, angrily.  Yeah.  But he just did it so casually.  And matter-of-factly.  Like, this is just a statement of truth.  Almost a friendly statement.  Like, he was just so fucking good.  And he's one of those guys who's not overrated.  No.  He's not overrated.  You watch Apocalypse Now, where it was just his face. 
[03:38:00]  And even the stutters, where he's talking about when he found that pile of inoculated  arms, and he's like, and I just, I wanted to, and he's like, just reaching for things  to say.  Yeah.  And even that was fucking perfect.  But somehow, he, as much as he doesn't care, he comes across, he stays in character.  So like, as he's reaching for what to say, you don't think that's Brando trying to figure  out what line is next.  You think that's Colonel Kurtz trying to figure out what to say.  Yeah.  When they played the recording of him in the beginning, he said, I dreamt of a snail  slithering on the edge of a straight razor and surviving. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  Like, what a horrible image.  A snail on the edge of a straight razor.  Because it's a little body.  Yeah.  Just slithering.  Every inch of it.  Ugh.  And he just kept saying slithering.  Yeah.  Slithering.  He was great.  Um, but Frank, I, I love, I didn't even know that Frank guys did Little Shop of Horrors.  I didn't either.  And I love that movie.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I love, you've seen it, I'm sure.  Years ago.  Do we have the, I mean, I'll watch it.  Thank you, the Blu-ray.  I think I left it here. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, we put it with your stuff in the back.  Oh, I still have that.  I'll bring that stuff home today.  Thanks.  The Blu-ray has new commentary, new scenes.  You love their bonuses.  Jimmy and his bonuses.  It's all Frank Oz stuff.  Okay.  Do you, do you like musicals?  You like a musical.  I fucking hate.  Do you like a cheesy musical?  No.  A fun, a fun musical.  Oh, Oklahoma.  No, I did like the, I loved Book of Mormon, which I've seen three times.  That I truly, it's one of the greatest things I've ever seen.  Yeah.  I mean, that's kind of, you can't really, that's not to say you like musicals, though. 
[03:39:30]  That's what every musical should be.  Yeah.  Really funny, I mean comedies, really edgy, smart, dark, you know, it was everything that  to me a comedy should be or a show should be.  Well, Little Chop is obviously a musical, but I watched it like a month ago, and I was  like, I forgot how great this was, because when I was a kid, there was like five movies  that I, I only had five movies, I just watched them over and over again.  It was that, Clue, Willy Wonka.  The original Willy Wonka.  Yeah, with, with Gene Wilder. 
[03:40:00]  I was watching clips of that recently, because I kind of want to meet Gene Wilder and talk  to him.  Yeah.  I met him.  I know you did, and you got me, you got me a Blazing Saddle sign, I love you for that,  because he was such a, he's one of the greatest comic actors ever.  Yeah, he really is.  When he talks about Yelda, he starts to tear up all the time.  Does he?  Yeah, still to this day.  And he would yell, no one yelled funnier.  Yeah.  Than Gene, oh, thank you very much.  Yeah.  Oh, DeRosa.  Frank Osda, what about Bob?  That was a funny movie.  Yeah, I love that movie.  Gene Wilder was very, Willy Wonka is so, when he, he's so, Gene Wilder could do anything 
[03:40:30]  and not be cheesy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was, he pulled that movie off.  And that's movie, that's an impossible movie to pull off.  Johnny Depp didn't pull Willy Wonka off at all.  No.  Because he embraced it.  Like, he was, he was, he was like a psychotic.  Oh, who was the one that told the story on the air here?  Did they tell the story about when Gene Wilder fell down the first take?  Maybe.  I'm not sure.  Who told that story?  Um, and again, I apologize if I'm repeating it. 
[03:41:00]  I don't know if I saw this online or if somebody here told it, but Gene Wilder, when they were  doing Willy Wonka, the first, he said, I'll do it only if in the first scene where you  let me walk in with a cane and then fall down and then jump up again.  And when they said, why do you want to do that?  And he said, because then the audience will never know if I'm telling the truth, which  is a brilliant.  And it really, and it works.  You never knew what he was saying, if it was right or bullshit.  And there was no explanation for it.  It's like, why is he doing that?  Like, why?  He, because he just wants to have people not knowing what is going on in his head. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  Um, I don't remember where I heard that story.  Uh, Mike.  Mike in Chicago.  Hey guys.  What's up, buddy?  Hi, Mike.  I'm doing the, uh, the after show.  How are you doing, Jimmy?  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Um, it's interesting that you're talking about Brando and having Frank Oz tomorrow because  in the movie, the score, in the, uh, additional scenes where they're doing the commentary,  Frank Oz talks about what a prick and how difficult Brando was to work with.  Good.  He wanted to try different blocking shots at different angles.  And Brando's like, why? 
[03:42:00]  We already did it perfectly the first time.  Why do you want to do an additional this angle, that angle?  Like, what's his name?  Uh, uh, Orson Welles.  Orson Welles.  Yeah.  I already did it.  There's something about obese icons where they just don't want to be bossed around.  I already did it.  I've already, yeah, I already did it.  It was perfect.  It was right.  Elvis.  Elvis is on it.  Thanks, Mike.  Yeah, hopefully they'll shit on Brando a little bit.  I would love to.  Not even just shit on him just to be like, yeah, fucking dick, like, it's hilarious stories.  Like, you've talked about, and I've watched them too, the Brando-Larry King interviews  on YouTube.  It's the greatest thing ever. 
[03:42:30]  Just watching Brando fucking around with Larry King.  Kissing him.  And Larry King said that he was like, you know, he went and picked Brando up.  Brando said, come get me.  Or meet me, let's go for a drive.  And it was Brando, and Larry King said, I wouldn't have normally, but it was Brando.  Yeah, can you imagine being a guy, like, you're an interviewer.  That's what you do when you have Brando.  He was a guy, Brando was a guy who, like, no matter who you are in Hollywood, you had  to be blown away by him.  I mean, some of the older school guys probably didn't give a fuck about him because they  were already, like, Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant.  Like, those guys were already legends by the time Brando kind of came along. 
[03:43:00]  But anyone, De Niro, Pacino, all these guys, I mean, they worship Brando.  They have to.  Nicholson.  Nicholson.  All those guys.  Who's, like, who's now?  Like, there's that, and then there was Nicholson, Pacino, De Niro.  Like, who's now?  Nobody right now.  Nobody, right?  Well, people say Pitt or Clooney, but they're...  Stop Hanks, right?  Nah, Hanks is good, but he's not on that level of...  No, and Pitt and Clooney are not anywhere near.  They're just very good looking.  Meryl Streep is kind of seen as a... 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  On the level of being gods, like, Meryl Streep is up there.  Helen Mirren?  She has the respect factor, but she's not, like, she is untouchable.  She just had a long career.  Yeah.  Like, it's not like she's done that many great things.  It's just...  Clint Eastwood, sort of?  Clint Eastwood is...  Not respected as an actor like that.  No.  Like, he's a Hollywood icon, but he's not looked at...  Like, Brando was just seen as a master, and there was this fucking idolatry of fucking  Marlon Brando.  Yeah.  And I can't think of an actor now that people have that for. 
[03:44:00]  They had it for Stanley Kubrick as a director.  He had that thing.  I mean, dude, I talked to Matthew Modine, like, a week or two ago, and he's still, like,  in awe of Kubrick.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  This is back from Full Metal Jacket.  Who has that?  Scorsese has that.  Yes.  Martin Scorsese has that.  Oh, Spielberg has that fucking thing.  It's interesting, though, because Scorsese obviously thinks that Leonardo DiCaprio is  a guy, because Scorsese used to use De Niro for everything, and DiCaprio is obviously Scorsese's 
[03:44:30]  new guy.  Well, he's also younger, and he can play a lot of the roles De Niro can no longer play,  and he's a big box office.  Although DiCaprio can be great, and I do like him as an actor.  I think there's, like, I think Gary Oldman.  Oh, yeah.  But he's underrated, Gary Oldman.  Very underrated.  Because nobody thinks, like, he's not, like, he's not a billionaire, A-lister, celebrity  guy.  No, in Hollywood he is, though.  I mean, and I think Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of those guys that everybody looks at  in awe. 
[03:45:00]  Like, I think Philip Seymour Hoffman is recognized as being amazing.  Joaquin Phoenix is really good.  Yeah, I don't love Joaquin Phoenix.  Yeah, he turned me off and walked the line, to tell you the truth.  I didn't like him as Johnny Cash at all.  Who else?  Not, not, uh...  I said him earlier, but would Johnny Depp fall into that?  Johnny Depp is respected a lot.  I don't know if, like, that Brando liked Johnny Depp a lot.  Edward Norton, too.  Edward Norton is one of those guys.  Edward Norton's great, yeah.  Edward Norton's a really good actor.  None of them are looked at like Brando. 
[03:45:30]  And under that, it's Nicholson, De Niro, Pacino.  I think Oscars have something to do with it.  Like, multi-Oscars, and Hank's won, too, but he's just not seen as...  I also think acting is not, like, respected the same way it was.  I was just gonna say that.  Maybe you're right.  I don't think it's valued where, like, in Looney Tunes and those kind of old serial things,  they constantly portrayed old celebrities as being current and relevant,  but you don't see that anymore.  Well, you just discussed it for a second, that he had to bring it back to cartoons.  Sam and I both wanted to fucking strangle you, 
[03:46:00]  but you made a valid point with cartoons, which is what you do.  Mike has...  This is right.  Mike.  Hey.  What's up, buddy?  What's up, guys?  Hi.  Norton, I love you, man.  Thanks, Mike.  Daniel Day-Lewis has just gotta be the guy.  Just everything he puts out is so super consistent.  He's got this Lincoln thing coming out that nobody can wait to see.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think you might be right.  He's one of those guys in Hollywood who is absolutely respected by all the other actors. 
[03:46:30]  If you sign him onto a project, he's one of the few that could do whatever he wants.  Yeah.  Like, he is the posted-on-the-forehead guy, probably.  Yeah.  Like, in There Will Be Blood.  And they're saying, like, Lincoln is just ridiculous.  I mean, have you seen the trailer for him?  No.  He looks like Lincoln, and he seems like he's gonna perform well.  The trailer looks really good, but they're saying the movie is ridiculous.  He's one of those guys, and Hoffman's another one of those films.  Oh, Dustin Hoffman's another one, who has seen, like, De Niro and Pacino,  because of Midnight Cowboy, because of Kramer vs. Kramer. 
[03:47:00]  Dustin Hoffman is the guy that gets that respect.  But he's, like, he's, like, same generation as them.  Yeah.  Oh, I think we got Danica Patrick coming in here right now.  I've never met her.  Neither have I.  Let's get, Eric, have the intern video it.  The video camera is on my desk in my office.  Tell him to run.  Yeah, tell him to hurry up.  Danica Patrick.  Eric, welcome.  Sit wherever you're comfortable.  Sit next to Jim.  Okay.  My name's Sam.  This is Jim Norton.  Hi.  It's nice to meet you.  Hi.  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  Danica Patrick is, of course, a racing superstar. 
[03:47:30]  You're also always listed in the sexiest athletes category.  When you first started, like, getting listed as that,  did you like that, or was it more like I'd really,  people aren't concentrating on my racing right now?  I don't think it's ever bad if somebody wants to talk about you being attractive to them.  I hear you.  I don't know if it's like Jim on the other hand.  And, you know, sometimes, usually the publications that talk about that 
[03:48:00]  or put you in a ranking or a list aren't usually primarily covering racing.  Yeah, I guess Maxim doesn't usually.  No, they don't really, you know, Maxim doesn't usually cover the field.  So they, you know, it's flattering.  How long did it take before it became, because it's kind of a boys' club, that job.  And how long did it take before they stopped looking at you as the beautiful woman  and like, all right, it's just Danica, another good racer.  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, if there's an attractive guy, he gets looked at as, like, the hot guy racer. 
[03:48:30]  So I don't think, I don't know.  I mean, I guess until you're not hot anymore, they won't.  Or even, okay, not even as attractive, but just as, like, how long.  I think I know what you mean.  Yeah, just as another racer.  You know, I think time, as time passes and you prove yourself and you earn the respect of the people around you  and they see you for more than at first glance and, you know, first impression,  which could be good or bad, you don't know, then you kind of get past that.  And they start to, they know you as a person and they care about you that way. 
[03:49:00]  And they talk more about what you're like as a person and you're racing.  How did you get involved in racing?  Because I would think that it would be odd for you to see this thing,  that there is nobody that looks like me doing this, but I want to do it.  Like, usually you can see yourself doing it because, you know, the people doing it kind of are like you.  Well, they're all short like me.  It's, you know, I never really thought about that much when I was growing up.  I started racing when I was 10 years old and my mom and dad never put any real focus on being a girl 
[03:49:30]  or being different or being the best girl.  It was about being the best driver.  Was your dad into that type of stuff or was that like kind of how you bonded with him  or is that something you just did?  No, it was something my dad was into.  He raced snowmobiles, midgets, motocross growing up his whole life.  And so we used to go to the midget races on Sunday nights every weekend.  And after he was done racing, he would work on them. 
[03:50:00]  So, you know, I've always been exposed to racing.  And it was actually my sister who wanted to start doing it when she was 8 years old and I was 10.  And I just, you know, like brothers, sisters, brothers, they don't want to get left out.  You know, it's like.  You have a ridiculous ring on your finger.  I can't.  I mean, it literally, it's like she's an igloo on her hand.  How does your husband feel about you doing all of them?  I've never heard of it referred to that.  It's just, it's very rare I'm distracted by jewelry, but like, oh my, that is an amazing ring. 
[03:50:30]  It's the type of ring.  I think it's the lighting above us.  It's always that overhead lighting.  It's that in convention centers, it seems like when the lighting comes down from above,  it just seems to be a little, it adds size.  That's a great ring.  Guys, keep that in mind, lighting from above.  Keep it in mind.  And I have, I have lights in my house and specifically throw shadows where I need them.  I think it's, you don't give diamonds.  That's weird.  I think it's the type of ring though, that makes women look at like their husbands.  Like, what are you doing?  Like my wife would see that ring and be like, really, this is what you gave me. 
[03:51:00]  I have to be a little bit careful when somebody gets engaged to ask to look at their ring because  immediately or not immediately, but a lot of the time they're like, oh, it's just, it's not yours.  It's just so much.  I don't care.  I'm happy for you.  I, you know, it's, it's the symbol that means the most, but I guess, I think I very shallow,  shallowly, that's not even a word.  Shallow.  Yeah, it is.  Uh, thank you.  Um, I'm not very good at that stuff.  So, um, I think I remember saying something in passing and joking. 
[03:51:30]  My husband and I, we never talked about getting married before we got engaged.  We just got engaged and, uh, you just know, you know, and, uh, I said something about  being bigger is better with a diamond.  Yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  You should laugh when they say something and when they compliment it, you should just go  this old thing.  No, no, no.  And then hold it in their face like green lantern.  Usually it goes, oh, that's so dirty.  That's usually the answer.  Like all women have with their diamonds.  Oh, that's so pretty.  Like, oh, it's so dirty right now.  Yeah.  They feel awkward because you, but basically what you want to say is, well, yeah, he obviously 
[03:52:00]  loves me a lot more than your guy loves you.  Oh, no.  Exactly.  After your, your husband has obviously made a significant investment in you.  Yes.  How does he feel about you, uh, doing the modeling stuff and the, and the.  He doesn't, he doesn't really mind at all.  I think the question he always asks me is that, what does this help?  That's what he always says.  Because with exposure comes, there's, there's a negative side to it too.  There's a privacy issues.  There's, um, all kinds of other stuff that come with it that isn't so great. 
[03:52:30]  So if you're going to go and expose yourself and I don't even mean in a skin way, I mean,  just expose yourself and, uh, for, from an awareness standpoint, what are you getting  for it in return?  And how can you make that, how can you translate that into endorsements or money or whatever,  you know, um, cause that's the point at the end of the day or a better ride or more  sponsors or something's got to pay for this ring.  Um, so, uh, or his, or his, I like to buy him nice stuff too.  You do?  Do you buy him jewelry?  I, I, well guys.  Does he have like big rapper necklaces and stuff? 
[03:53:00]  Uh, he's got two chains.  I heard there's a rapper named two chains and I just had to fit that in.  Um, so I bought him three chains.  Um, what does he, what does he do?  Is he a driver as well?  He is, uh, he was a physical therapist.  Oh really?  He still is.  Um, but he just doesn't practice as often.  Did you want somebody, because what you do is very dangerous.  It's a dangerous job.  I mean, did you kind of want somebody, like a lot of women don't want to marry cops because  of the danger.  Did you want somebody out of that or just to be able to get away from it at the end of the  day?  Or did you not care?  No, I didn't care.  I, I, I think for me it's, you know, I just needed somebody that was strong and smart and 
[03:53:30]  you always, you need someone that you respect.  Did you meet him because you were getting physical therapy?  I was, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  And we, we, we knew each other.  That's how we met.  And then about a year and a half later we started dating.  Wow.  So I was, I still do that rehab to this day from my injury when I was about 20.  So that was, you know, 10 years ago.  What is it?  A back injury?  It was a hip injury.  Oh, okay.  No, I should, I'd say it's still a hip injury.  I still do my hip rehab.  What's the conditioning that racers have to go through? 
[03:54:00]  Because I don't know, people who aren't familiar probably think you just.  Depends on the driver.  You get to drive.  Tony Stewart would tell me I don't work out.  He just drinks a lot of Coca-Cola.  Is he a fat guy?  I don't know who he is.  He's, he's not skinny, but.  Very diplomatic.  All this ring is dirty.  He's, no, but you're, you're never as big in person as what people think on TV.  But, and then, you know, you find the other spectrum.  I mean, I'm, I'm probably fall into that category.  I work out pretty much every day.  Although my 5.20 a.m. call time this morning to go to hair and makeup was probably a little 
[03:54:30]  bit hurtful to help me get, get a workout in.  So I didn't work out today.  But I work out basically every day and my job is a workout.  So I feel lucky for that.  Are you, like, I'm always amazed.  Like, you know, I, I hate being close to other cars.  I just, do you really?  It makes me very uncomfortable.  So you're not, you're not one of those people that just wishes they had a bumper and they  could just hit people out of the way or let them know that you're angry or anything?  No, I wish I had a tank so I could just run them over.  I want no risk to myself.  Right.  Like when you're on the highway and a big truck is next to you, you get nervous. 
[03:55:00]  Or go-go gadget wheels.  Yeah, to go up and over.  But how do you, I'm amazed that racers can be, how close are you to other  cars when you're doing 180 miles an hour?  Oh, you're sometimes touching.  Amazing to me.  My God.  I'd be terrified.  I mean, like, even when-  Most people would be terrified, though, doing what you do and having all, having so many  people listening and they'd be nervous.  Yeah.  But it's not a, it's a different fear.  I mean, I feel like it's just the three of us.  Or, well, I guess there's about 10 of us in here, but it's just the three of us, right? 
[03:55:30]  You've got three chains and an entourage.  Yes.  Well, yeah, but we're not exactly, like, the worst thing that could possibly happen is we'll  be very embarrassed, which we very often are.  But we're not-  Yes, or we should be even more than we are.  Do you have a memory or a story you could tell me about the time that you were most embarrassed?  Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.  When Jim and I were together and the host of America's Most Wanted came in here.  Oh, God.  That would be a good story.  Jim, if you want to-  Oh, we were, this is true.  Sam and I were doing the show and John Walsh, who hosts America's Most Wanted- 
[03:56:00]  Are you familiar with his background and how he started hosting the show?  Because his son was murdered.  Yes, exactly.  In a brutal fashion.  Decapitated.  You made a distasteful joke.  No, no, no, no.  He didn't make a joke.  No, it wasn't a joke.  So, John walked in and we had been talking about the case and John and Adam and all that  stuff.  So, John walks in-  He has the clip.  Okay, here's the clip.  It's not a joke.  This is when John walked in the room.  This is when he walked in.  Yeah.  Is this him?  No, I don't know.  Yes, there he is.  Yes, he is.  Okay. 
[03:56:30]  He's coming in.  I can hear his voice.  Adam Walsh.  Hi, John.  How are you?  What did I say?  Hi, John.  How are you?  Oh, my God.  I'm an idiot.  And you can hear me going, hi, John.  How are you?  Hi, John.  How are you?  John, John, John.  Yeah, he could have called that so many times by women.  But he called him Adam.  It's the worst thing that's ever happened.  It's made the question, what's the most embarrassing thing that's happened to you on the air become  so easy.  Yeah.  Like, it's never left me.  It never will.  Yeah, because it's not only- 
[03:57:00]  I feel like you guys had just said right before it, is he here?  Is that him like John Walsh?  And then all of a sudden you go, Adam, hi.  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, I'm a moron is what people tend to forget.  But it was a total error.  It was one of those things that we've all said the wrong name.  I've done it a million times.  But just in that case, the wrong name.  If you would have said, hey, Frank Walsh, it wouldn't have mattered.  No.  But Adam, you couldn't have picked a worse name.  It's the worst possible thing to call that man.  Not even name.  Like the worst thing I could call him.  But he took it in stride, though.  He was like, eh, no, John. 
[03:57:30]  He was okay.  He was a great, great guest.  And he recovered.  We want to talk about our guest, Danica Patrick, and what you're here to talk about, which  is not how embarrassing I am to be around.  But you have a charity to talk about.  I do.  I've been part of an awareness campaign with COPD for COPD for three years now.  Which is what?  From the beginning.  COPD.  So chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Most people probably know it as emphysema or chronic bronchitis.  And we've been doing lots of great things over the last three years. 
[03:58:00]  And we're just continuing to raise awareness for it.  There's, of the 24 million people that have it, only half know it.  My grandma, she passed away.  She was only 61.  And I think that's one of the shocking things is how young you pass away from something like  this.  And you just end up losing lung function.  Like she was on oxygen 24 hours a day.  It starts as like a cough and then it just...  Yeah, coughing up phlegm.  You get out of breath doing, you know, ordinary activities that maybe you shouldn't be getting  out of breath doing, like walking up the stairs.  But I kind of get out of breath sometimes walking upstairs. 
[03:58:30]  I do, too.  I panic about that stuff.  I get out of the top.  I'm like, why do my legs burn right now?  Oh, boy.  No, not...  Could it be tension, too?  It could be tension, too, right?  Altitude?  I don't know.  Oh, you're panicking me.  But...  You don't have chronic bronchitis.  Well, I have a solution for you.  Go to driveforcopd.org and take the five-question screener.  And then you'll know if you're at risk for COPD.  No, I don't want to take a five...  I want to take a 20-question screener.  So if it's not looking good, I can fudge a couple of them so I come out. 
[03:59:00]  With five questions, you get two yeses, you're in trouble.  Yeah, yeah.  Drive for...  Drive...  Are you over 35?  Thank you for asking that.  Very polite of you.  I'm 44.  Drive for COPD?  So that's one.  That's one check.  Oh, yeah.  What's the other one?  Have you smoked over 100 cigarettes in your life?  Oh, God, yeah.  I quit, though.  Yeah, you should probably go to a good check.  It's funny.  I'm giving her...  I'm adding on.  But yes, but I quit.  Like, she's the questionnaire.  Yeah, 100, but that was a while back.  But it's, you know, it's one of those things.  I feel like with health, it's so scary, but yet once you know everything checks out, there's 
[03:59:30]  such relief and ownership.  Like, you want to...  It's like, I feel like I want to go get checked out every six months just to make sure that  I'm okay.  And if you do catch something, you know you've done it, caught it so early.  So...  Did she smoke your grandmother?  Yeah.  So is that...  She did.  It was kind of like...  Is it emphysema or is it...  Okay.  Where is the questionnaire?  Because right now, anybody who has a cough that's listening to this is panicking, just  like Jimmy is.  I know, we're 35.  Yeah.  It's...  Or went to enough bars growing up, I suppose. 
[04:00:00]  But it's drive4copd.org.  Okay.  Yeah.  So it's just...  It kills more people than breast cancer and diabetes combined.  And I think when you tell people that, they're surprised to hear that.  And they then all of a sudden go, what is this again?  So...  It's the number four.  Or drive...  The number four.  Yep.  Copd.org.  I never heard of COPD.  Like, obviously, I've heard of...  Bronchitis.  Yeah, bronchitis.  And I was trying to say pulmonary, but I couldn't say pulmonary.  Pulmonary.  So I said something else.  And, of course, emphysema.  Yeah.  But I panic about breathing. 
[04:00:30]  We shouldn't call her Adam Walsh.  Yeah, I couldn't have.  It wouldn't be as embarrassing right now, though.  But I want to go take that.  I wish we had an embarrassing story that you could tell, like, after he left, like, there was  a new one and I was in it.  Generally, Jim and I are consummate professionals.  That happens very seldom.  So, unfortunately, I may not.  You smell amazingly good.  I can smell it from here.  Yeah, I mean...  Wow.  Thank you.  It's not like a lot of times celebrities come in and they smell very strong, but it's  a very clean...  It smells almost like...  Just like a shampoo smell.  It's a girl smell, which is a nice smell.  Yeah. 
[04:01:00]  It doesn't happen in the studio very often.  No, not at all.  It's usually just rotting corpses walking through.  You smell really good.  So, COPD...  Gosh, thank you for...  You make me feel a little nice.  Thanks.  Yeah.  You're welcome.  No, I'm all panicking.  You just basically panicked me and as soon as we're done...  You're saying your goodbyes.  No, as soon as we're done with this interview, I'm honestly...  It's like we're done at 11 o'clock.  I am going to go to drive for COPD and take the five-question...  You really are...  Dude, I'm two out of five already.  That's true.  What are some of the other questions? 
[04:01:30]  Do you get out of breath easily doing normal activities?  See, it's hard to say, like...  Because I think I panic a little bit.  Like, I can do...  I can do a good amount...  I think you have panic attacks.  You might be right.  I think that's what we're sort of coming to a conclusion.  Do you cough up phlegm?  No, occasionally.  I guess occasionally the...  Yes, click.  I don't know.  That's three out of five.  What's the last one?  I can't remember the last one.  What is the last one?  I always forget the last one.  But those are four of the five.  Do you panic easy?  Probably. 
[04:02:00]  Do you panic easy?  Yes.  Has a woman ever looked at you disgusted when she saw you nude?  Yes.  So are you...  Do any of you work for the COPD Fund?  I work for the COPD Foundation.  COPD Foundation?  The Foundation.  So am I just panicking or do I have COPD?  Well, if you take the screener, you'll find out.  And you may be able to calm yourself down.  The thing about it and all seriousness is that...  I'll spit that out.  Oh, seriousness.  That's okay.  I couldn't get pulmonary.  Is that it's progressive.  So it starts off slow and it goes slow the whole time. 
[04:02:30]  It's just all this...  And usually when it takes away from you being able to do the things you want to do, it's  to a state that is not great.  Right.  So go ahead.  Take charge.  Go check it out.  That's how Johnny Carson died.  He was always in pretty good health, but he was a terrible smoker.  And he went off his boat, his little yacht, and he dove into the water and they said he  came up and he went, whew, I'm having trouble catching my breath.  And he was always a very active guy, played tennis, very, very active.  That was it.
