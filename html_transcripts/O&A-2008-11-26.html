<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about childhood dioramas, transitioning into a humorous, albeit somewhat homophobic, reflection on Anthony's upbringing and his father's potential disapproval of his creative pursuits.  This led to a brainstorming session for a listener contest involving Opie and Anthony-themed elementary school projects, with callers suggesting bizarre entries like an AK-47 made of macaroni and an Opie and Anthony popsicle stick wishing well. Anthony further recounted his father discarding his childhood crafts, attributing it to his father believing him to be "fruity."

The show then welcomed forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Bodden and another coroner, Peter Dean, from HBO's "Autopsy."  The conversation centered on Dr. Bodden's experiences, including the challenges of detecting suffocation murders and the complexities of forensic pathology, contrasting the realities of the field with the misinterpretations often seen on television shows like "Quincy."  They discussed high-profile cases like the Sid Vicious case and O.J. Simpson trial (where Dr. Bodden testified for the defense), and even touched upon the John F. Kennedy assassination and its controversial autopsy. The segment took an unexpected turn when a cockroach was discovered in the studio, leading to a chaotic, expletive-laden reaction. Intern "Cream Pie Jones" infamously ate the cockroach live on air, prompting further outrage and disgust, and resulting in a proposed "cockroach hunt" contest for the interns.  The discussion continued on the studio's cockroach infestation and the poor reception of Cream Pie Jones' previous stunts involving a "shit hat" and other toilet-related antics.

The cockroach infestation continued to be a major theme, with the hosts and crew embarking on a search for more roaches, finding them in various locations around the studio.  The discovery of numerous insects, particularly behind the refrigerator and near old condiments, led to escalating antics, culminating in Pat Duffy snorting dead baby roaches.  Following this, Rob Zombie called into the show, discussing his friendship with Tom Papa, his upcoming Halloween remake, and his work.  A superfan, Sam Roberts, who had a Rob Zombie tattoo, was present in the studio and visibly excited to meet his idol.  Later, eco-therapist Melissa Pickett joined the show.  Initially, the hosts feigned interest in her work (previously featured on a Penn & Teller show), but the conversation devolved into discussions about eco-guilt and the impact of humans on the environment, utilizing rocks as a grounding technique, labyrinths, and personal well-being, interspersed with increasingly vulgar and offensive comments from the hosts.

A recurring "Melissa Pickett Show" segment followed, where Melissa fielded listener questions about environmental concerns.  These calls, ranging from a caller pouring gasoline on flowers to a soldier inquiring about the environmental impact of IEDs, were punctuated by increasingly vulgar and offensive remarks from Opie and Anthony towards Melissa. This was followed by a lengthy, hostile phone call with Maria, who criticized Jimmy's language and engaged in a sexually aggressive exchange with the hosts and her husband, Arthur.  The conversation degenerated further into offensive and insensitive jokes regarding Maria’s daughter’s cerebral palsy, which was revealed during the call. Greg Giraldo was briefly mentioned.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the ongoing cockroach infestation, showing off numerous roaches trapped in glue traps, and included a pest control expert calling in to advise on dealing with the cockroach eggs.  Another pest control expert later detailed the prevalence of rats and roaches in New York City, describing infestations and pest control methods, which again led back to the studio's infestation and Cream Pie Jones eating a cockroach. This segued into a prolonged discussion about the definition of "snowballing" and whether certain sexual acts constitute homosexuality, along with a graphic description of an intern smelling another intern's anus.

The show then delved into a debate about the definition of "gay," using crude and offensive language, focusing on graphic sexual details and the subjective nature of defining sexuality. A tangent about a friend's video recording of a sexual encounter involving a strap-on and a prostitute was also described. This led to brainstorming a radio contest, evolving through several increasingly vulgar iterations.  The show later featured a prom-themed contest with sexually suggestive descriptions and phone calls from women interested in being Anthony's prom date.  A significant portion mocked clips from *Quincy*, interspersed with offensive and sexually graphic commentary, including anti-Semitic, homophobic, and racist remarks.  Brian O’Halloran and Jeff Anderson from *Clerks* were briefly mentioned. A discussion on offensive language, including the n-word, the f-word, and other racial and homophobic slurs, followed, touching upon the controversy of Native American sports mascots.  The show concluded with a segment focusing on the hosts' disdain for sports mascots, particularly the Philadelphia Phanatic, filled with profanity and criticism of their perceived ineffectiveness.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh, my God.  What's going on?  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's stupid.  Something ridiculously loud and obnoxious.  I sound like the best of Dallas Syndrome records.  We're never going to make everybody happy,  so why do we have to now make more people not happy?  Oh, no.  It's stupid.  It's audio vomit.  If I may use the word doody.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I didn't even know what a diorama was until you just explained it.  Yeah.  I knew it was a shoebox thing because we all had to make them in school, 
[00:00:30]  but I didn't realize it was called a diorama.  Is it a diorama?  I would assume it sounds like it would be.  Yeah.  You'd make a little scene in a shoebox,  and then you'd cut the part of the top off and cover it with wax paper.  Yeah.  Wax paper.  And then you'd cut a hole in the front,  and you'd pick it up and you'd put the open end of the shoebox that you opened  and covered with wax paper under a light.  And then you'd look through the little hole,  and you'd see the little scene that you made inside with little army men, 
[00:01:00]  a little mirror for a lake.  You know the kids that did real well making dioramas?  You know what they're doing today?  What?  Working in museums.  Or doing radio.  I was very good at the diorama.  Were you really?  Oh, yeah.  Yuck.  I used to impress all the girls with my diorama.  You know, a little known fact about Anthony.  I have some diorama.  Could I get some Pepto-Bismol?  You were a goody two-shoes growing up.  It's pretty obvious.  Oh, I was.  You talk about looking in your microscopes as a kid. 
[00:01:30]  Microscopes, telescopes, chemistry sets.  And making puppet shows, and yeah.  Yeah, I was a little fairy, is what you would call them today.  I was a little fairy Mary.  Your dad ruined you, man,  because you had the makings of being a brilliant scientist,  and he thought you had the makings of being a fag.  That was pretty much what a dear old dad kind of,  he thought I was going to be a wussy.  If he would have let you be, 
[00:02:00]  you probably would have done great things.  I may have been an astronaut.  Not that we're doing.  I want to be an astronaut.  Not that we're not doing great things with this unbelievable radio show.  On a daily basis, I look back with pride at what I did that day.  I'm so proud.  People look at a guy like Einstein, whatever,  and they wonder, what would happen  if he hadn't had this nurturing as a child?  Let's just say alcoholism had been involved.  Einstein would have been a comic genius on the radio.  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of discovering.  Exactly.  Instead of discovering something.  Yeah.  I really do think there was a defined fork in the road of my life. 
[00:02:30]  Sure.  And I kind of took the, maybe a wrong turn.  It's funny because a lot of people wonder why we don't have flying cars,  like the Jetsons.  The reason?  Because Anthony's dad thought he was a fag  and had to get rid of all his scientific, yeah, stuff.  Yeah, yeah, everything kind of, you know,  come on, bigger man.  Hey, you're in man training, you would tell me. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, I don't know if there's a bit here.  We're always thinking bits, okay?  A lot of this stuff, it falls by the wayside.  Yeah.  Which is brought up a lot by Ron and Fez,  that we have a lot of things that never develop.  Oh, really?  Never go to the full stage.  Ends in that stage, that pupa stage,  whatever the hell it's called.  Yes.  But then some of these things do take off,  like our animation festival will happen.  You're saying we have a lot of bit abortions?  Yeah.  I'm wondering if maybe some of the listeners  could, like, develop some of these dioramas or whatever. 
[00:03:30]  A diorama based on the show?  That could be pretty funny.  That would be, based on anything to do with the show.  There's a picture of a diorama.  Yeah.  That one's done differently, though.  That one's up on its end.  Yeah, we should.  I like the one you look through.  Yeah, but I think the one up on the end  is better for our purposes.  Yeah, yeah, then you'll see it better.  Then you can put these up on the website.  Uh-huh.  We really should do that, man.  We should have a dumb little contest.  The best, the best Opie and Anthony diorama.  Diorama.  Diorama.  We're giving you homework. 
[00:04:00]  Right, basically the show.  The show's giving you homework.  We're your cool teacher.  You know, we're the teacher that takes you outside on a nice day  to teach you outside under the tree.  And let you smoke pot behind the tree.  We'll look the other way.  No problem.  We won't hassle you.  No, no.  But it's all animations and dioramas,  just things children would like.  I know.  Who can make the biggest gift in diapers  in the shape of an Opie and Anthony member?  I know.  I can't wait till we have the  make something out of macaroni contest. 
[00:04:30]  Spray-painted gold.  God, what idiots.  We are retarded.  That's why they love us.  It is just child.  These are child assignments we give out.  If these people really knew how old we were,  they would be just shocked.  It's so horrid that we're giving out little projects that you give to children.  We stopped growing.  I truly believe I stopped aging mentally at 26 years old. 
[00:05:00]  And again, I always take issue with the,  I don't like the fact that you've given yourself at least 12 years.  I know.  It really is.  I honestly don't see a big change.  Aside from, you know, where I am in life, things like that.  But in my mental state and what I'm thinking, 15.  Right.  Which is just horrible.  Well, I stayed at college until I was 24.  Because I was like, wow, this is really cool.  I could live as a college kid for the rest of my life. 
[00:05:30]  And then, like, the girls started looking at you and you just,  you could tell they're looking at you and going,  what a creep.  Why is he still, why is he still walking around campus and hanging out at the bars?  You don't want to be the old guy at the club.  At 24, I finally had to move on.  And then around 26, I'm like, yeah, this is the age I'll live for the next,  I don't know, 30 years.  Lock it in.  Yeah, I'm locked in at 26.  Bobby Big Rager, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I remember a while back there, I got a hold of some bad sushi. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  And it was brewing.  I mean, really brewing.  Yeah.  And I wound up making my own diurema.  Diurema?  Diurema.  I like diurema.  Yeah, very good.  It's a diurema of a mudslide.  California mountainside caving in.  All right.  You know, we might be on to something.  John in Cleveland.  John?  Yeah, I'm making the official opium.  Opie and Anthony popsicle stick wishing well. 
[00:06:30]  Wow, that'd be nice.  I'm getting a dream of it.  Get your, and he's listening to himself.  He's going to get a big laugh there.  Of course he is.  Maybe we should do, maybe we should open the contest to just, like, kid projects in general.  Elementary school projects.  Like, maybe someone can make something Opie and Anthony related with just macaroni.  Macaroni.  On a piece of construction paper.  Yeah.  On a piece of oak tag.  Right.  We are just the worst. 
[00:07:00]  Children.  My God.  My God, man.  Let's say hi to JC.  JC, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hi.  I was wondering if I could make an AK-47 out of macaroni for the contest.  That would be wonderful, JC.  That would rule.  Wonderful.  When's the due date?  No, that's just kind of a goofy contest we want to do, but we'll, like, display the better  ones on the website.  Right.  Now, make sure you have your projects in on time. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  And how should I make the bullets?  Out of macaroni, right?  Hmm.  All right.  It depends on how big of an AK-47 you make.  Yeah.  I would use maybe a little penne, some penne pasta for the bullets.  All right.  You don't have to use just elbow macaroni, although elbow macaroni was very unpopular  with the projects, as was the bowtie macaroni.  Really?  And then you'd just spray the whole thing with gold spray paint for some reason. 
[00:08:00]  This looks good.  And take it home and have your father throw it out because you're a fruit for making it.  Thanks, Dad.  Your father would throw your little things out?  Of course he would.  Really?  Why wouldn't he?  Only a homosexual would make such projects like that.  What'd you make that he threw out?  A little, it was the macaroni on oak tag construction paper, and it was kind of the shape of, it  was just sort of an abstract thing, almost like the sun, you know, but it was kind of 
[00:08:30]  making that elbow macaroni and then other kind of macaroni, and I spray painted it gold.  Nice.  And it was like, oh, just the sound of the Elmer's glue cracking and the macaroni hitting  the floor, the little gold macaronis hitting the floor.  Like, oh, thanks.  I really should have, you know, if it wasn't so repulsive to me, I should have went gay  and really shown pop.  Yeah, almost, he said it was almost like the sun.  To him, it was like his daughter. 
[00:09:00]  A little fruit.  Yeah, he didn't want a fruity sun.  He thought I was heading in a fruity direction.  I was very, I was nerdy.  I was just into science and things like that.  You could have been like a great scientist.  Instead, you'd tell.  I should have been into drinking and chicks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you are.  I know.  In the end, he won.  Dad wins.  Yeah.  That's true.  Thanks to dad.  We all like, you know, we're at a great job.  I don't know what I'm complaining for.  Yeah, right.  I didn't nurture you, you little sissy. 
[00:09:30]  I was such a little fruit.  To be married with two kids right now?  To be gumdrop?  To constantly cry.  I was such a crybaby.  Oh, big.  Look at his tummy cake.  Now you don't shut up.  Hey, this is Cheech.  And this is Chong.  And you're listening to Anthony Opie.  And one more.  Hey, this is Cheech.  And this is Chong.  And you're listening to...  The Opie and Anthony Show.  So listen up.  But I can't tell those guys apart, can you?  One guy's... 
[00:10:00]  No, they're both white.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  It's so good.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  The worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Slide a finger into me, Bob.  We got the death ghoul.  No.  On this side of the show today.  Very cool.  Wonderful.  Guest Dr. Michael Bodden.  Yeah.  But he did like five HBO specials.  The autopsy series.  And they're fascinating.  The autopsy series was fantastic. 
[00:10:30]  You can't not...  Great.  You can't not enjoy watching a guy talk about death as knowledgeably and comfortably.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  You think this Michael Bodden likes death?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Loves it.  Loves death.  He really loves death.  There was always a great...  That show, Autopsy, was always a good little mystery thing because they'd have a case and  he would tell how they solve it through the autopsy and find out what the dead could tell 
[00:11:00]  you.  It was a thing.  Like, the dead can tell their story.  I love when he finds, like, a fingernail.  Next thing you know, he could tell you it was a white male.  Well, yeah.  Between the age of 35 and 37 and he drowned.  Perhaps we could ask him about that case, the one where they found, I believe it was  the tip of a finger.  Yeah.  In a lake where a man had put his wife through a wood chipper.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  I bet you he can not only tell you what happened, but what she said to deserve it.  Well, should we bring him in?  Yeah, let's get it.  He has a friend with him who's I know...  Absolutely.  Hey, Roland, can we bring the good doctor in?  What, he's traveling with another ghoul?  He has another coroner friend with him.  I don't know if they like to be called ghouls.  Yes.  Perhaps not.  Oh, I know that guy.  Hey, I know you.  Hello, sir.  Hey, I know his...  You want to sit there?  Peter Dean is the coroner.  Yeah, you got some...  Hello, sir.  You got some terrific eyebrows there, sir.  Hey, huh?  Sunburn.  What is he, doctor? 
[00:12:00]  Sunburn, yeah.  Sure.  Serious American sunburn.  Show him how you do things here on...  Oh, satellite, yeah.  He doesn't understand.  They don't do that in England, do they?  No.  We have a lot of terrestrial stuff.  A certain amount of satellite, but not satellite radios.  Yeah.  This is like a...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They don't have it over there.  Head to the curb.  Yeah.  You get the curse on this medium.  Well, you know.  I'm here to learn.  Yeah, put the headphones on there so you can hear everybody.  We get the headphones and...  Yeah.  Dr. Bodden, make yourself comfortable.  Bodden.  Thank you.  Dr. Bodden.  Yes.  We've done about 12 now, 12 HBO documentaries, one a year. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, I thought it was five.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, that's okay.  You've been sleeping a little bit.  I've been very excited.  We were talking earlier how we enjoy the show.  The show Autopsy was great, watching your specials, and you're so comfortable with the  subject.  Well, that's what I do.  I know.  The thing is...  You're comfortable sitting here, and I'm nervous. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, but you know something?  Your line of work is a little more disturbing than this.  It depends how you look at it.  Yeah?  When I started out, I started out as an internist at Bellevue Hospital, an intern resident, seeing  people die and not being able to do anything to help.  That's really disturbing.  Once they're dead, then they're out of pain and suffering.  What's the worst that could happen?  You get a pulse.  We've had that happen a few times.  Really?  A guy goes to the morgue and sits up and says, what am I doing here?  Is that real?  Wow. 
[00:13:30]  It does happen.  It happens.  Because sometimes, especially in older people, the pulse becomes so faint and the breathing  becomes so faint that it's easily overlooked.  And after a few hours, they may come up.  We've had a number of these in New York, but they're all over the States.  What do you need that male nurse for?  That angel of death guy, you know, with a pillow?  It's with those guys, Dr. Bodden.  Oh, Jesus.  That's the kind that we can't tell.  That's the pillow.  Yeah.  That seems to be like a really... 
[00:14:00]  Let's take that.  Let's run with that for a minute.  The old pillow over the nose thing when you suffocate somebody.  How do you determine that somebody was murdered or if they just died in their sleep?  Oh, we're on.  We're on.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Make sure you say fuck a lot.  Hey, watch your language, Opie.  The thing about that is that we don't like to give primers on how to kill people.  Well, I wouldn't, yeah, either.  But I must say that suffocation is the hardest diagnosis for a medical examiner to make. 
[00:14:30]  Is it?  Because whereas shootings and stabbings and baseball bat injuries leave something to see  at autopsy.  If somebody suffocated, when the suffocating device, the hands or the pillow taken off,  everything pops back to normal.  Yeah.  So those are the hardest.  It was easier when we had feather pillows because the feather pillows would often break  and they'd inhale the feathers.  Oh, so I can see it. 
[00:15:00]  When I first started out, we had a few people who had inhaled the feathers in their windpipe  and lungs and we could say, hey, there's something wrong with this.  He's been suffering.  Yeah, I get it.  Go ahead, Jim.  Attacked and murdered by a chicken or something.  Well, how do they, don't they tell, don't the teeth leave a print in the back of your  lip?  Oh, you're pretty good at this.  Sometimes, it depends on the amount of force used or if something is pushed in the mouth,  like if a sock or something is pushed into the mouth to assist in the suffocation, it 
[00:15:30]  can leave injuries on the tongue and the inside.  But if it's, one of the things that happens with the sudden infant death cases with babies  who don't struggle very much, they can get wrapped up in bedding or they can get wrapped  up in plastic.  In the old days, these were plastic to prevent injuring the mattress when a kid urinates.  That's great.  They can get wrapped up. 
[00:16:00]  It can cause death and not leave any signs.  So those are the things that we look at very carefully.  I just was watching, I like watching the A&E crime shows and they had a case where a man  had, he was suspected of killing his infant and they had it as SIDS and a few years prior  he had another baby with another woman who died of SIDS and it turned out that they convicted 
[00:16:30]  him of murder.  Right, well, the thing there is, and the HBO specials you're talking about, we've had  a couple of those where the way one often identifies suffocation of babies is it happens  again and again.  Right.  And that alerts the police and the investigators that this isn't just by chance.  So the ones that get caught are the ones who usually have more than one. 
[00:17:00]  What's the toughest one you've ever worked on where you had to prove that somebody was  murdered and there really wasn't much evidence but you pulled it out?  Well, part of the problem is when we investigate a case as medical examiners, we're there not  just to do something in prosecution, we're there to do something for either side.  So our investigation was a crime committed.  Now, some of the tough ones are when we have a crime, the police think it's a crime and 
[00:17:30]  we don't find any evidence of a crime and say so.  But I think the toughest one was a serial murder in Massachusetts where a nurse was thought  to possibly be poisoning veterans by injecting various potassium into the intravenous lines.  This is about five or eight years ago.  I hear that's very hard to detect.  And yes, it is detected because as soon as we die, the potassium starts getting screwed 
[00:18:00]  up in the body.  The red cells break and all that.  And initially, there'd been some identification by the toxicologist, but his information on  it was wrong.  He had the wrong decimal point, and the judge wouldn't let him testify.  So we were able to make the identification in court, not by toxicology, but by the electrocardiogram, 
[00:18:30]  which with potassium shows certain abnormalities.  That is when the codes were called, they did an EKG, and we went back and were able to find  some of the EKGs and able to establish the toxicology, not by chemical analysis, but by clinical  symptoms and electrocardiogram.  That's kind of tough.  Did the person get convicted?  Yes.  A female nurse convicted, and it was in Massachusetts, which is a non-death penalty state. 
[00:19:00]  But this was federal because it was in the federal VA hospital.  So I had to then testify at a sentencing hearing, and the federal prosecutors were going for the  death penalty in Massachusetts, and the jury voted 11 to 1 for capital punishment, but  because one person held out, she's in jail someplace in Texas. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, it's got to be unanimous.  And she's been in the news every now and then because she has had affairs with various  prominent female murderers.  Oh, really?  Oh, wow.  In jail.  Love in the old prison.  In jail.  All right, so she's a good egg.  Yeah.  She's a fucking guller in jail.  How do you not like that?  So you've been involved with some really high-profile cases, too.  I didn't even realize, it said here, Sid Vicious's death.  Yeah, well, that was when I was the chief medical examiner in New York City, and Sid Vicious 
[00:20:00]  had been arrested for stabbing Nancy Spungett at the Chelsea Hotel, a wonderful hotel in West  23rd Street that a lot of famous writers had lived in, and he was in jail for stabbing Nancy  Spungett.  And he got bailout, and he came out, and within a few days he was dead from a drug overdose.  And when I went down there, his mom was there collecting his things down in Greenwich Village 
[00:20:30]  someplace, and he had a very high level of heroin because he had lost his tolerance while  he was in jail.  So he came out and shot up the same stuff.  Oh, wow.  And he died because he didn't wait to gradually develop the tolerance.  Wow, that'll happen?  Yeah.  And that's why often, it's amazing it doesn't happen more often because addicts, there's  no FDA approval for what's in little packets. 
[00:21:00]  And in the old days, when I started out in the 60s, 70s, when there was sort of organized  crime distribution of heroin, we'd analyze the packets, and they had pretty much the same  amount of heroin in them.  Then as more different groups came into it, and there was disorganized distribution of  heroin, the amounts of heroin in a packet varied a great deal, and if a kid, instead of taking  the usual packets, took one from a different supplier and had more heroin, he could die from 
[00:21:30]  an overdose, so the overdose has increased.  Wow.  Yeah, you were head of the medical examiner's office in New York City, and what year was  that?  Because it was...  Oh, I was in the...  Sid Vicious was about 1978, 79.  I was in the office for about 25 years.  Geez, so you probably saw a lot coming through there, huh?  Oh, we...  Yes.  We had...  We were up to 2,000 homicides a year then, and now it's down to about 500. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, 2,000 a year during the time you were in there.  Was it during the Koch years, or is that...  That was, yeah.  Koch and Dinkins.  That was during the Koch years, right?  And then, wow, that's a lot of work.  Yeah.  We had a lot more homicides then in England.  In England, where they used to not have guns, you know.  Ah, right.  There was a lot less murders, but there's a lot more stabbings, I think.  A lot more...  Yeah, they're still angry.  They're just using different tools.  That's right, but usually, you see, the thing is, when you stab somebody, usually you don't 
[00:22:30]  kill them, you know.  A gunshot wound to the head is pretty devastating, or to the chest, but stabbing, you have...  A person is more likely to survive.  Unless it's one of those multiple, just, you know, over and over, gang gang gang.  Anger, well, like, you know, O.J. will take that whole thing.  Well, see, there you are again.  O.J., the jury said he was not guilty.  Of course they did.  And you go along, you probably even think Lizzie Borden was guilty.  Well, you know, they made up a little rhyme about her. 
[00:23:00]  It has to be true.  That's PR.  Even back then, it was about 1890s, Lizzie Borden took an axe, gave her father...  Her mother 40 whacks.  When she saw what she had done, she gave her father 41.  41, yeah.  Now, the hip-hop culture of that day still lives with us, and it obscures the fact that  she was found not guilty.  That was some gangster rap back then.  Wow.  In England. 
[00:23:30]  Now, what do you...  No, no, no, that was, excuse me, that was in Massachusetts.  On that Massachusetts, yeah.  Paul River.  What, uh, the O.J. thing.  Now, obviously, I detect a tad bit of sarcasm, um, what, and I know it's ancient history at  this point, but what, what do you think went wrong with that case?  I mean, they had him.  Well, I think partly in the United States, the, uh, government has to prove its case.  And I think, uh, the general agreement, even the people who think, uh, that O.J., like, 
[00:24:00]  uh, uh, uh, Bugliosi, uh, Bugliosi, who wrote a big thing about it, and others who were  violently, uh, uh, thought that, uh, O.J. had done it, they all agreed that the prosecution  failed to prove its case.  Mm-hmm.  I think the criticism, in large measure, is the prosecution, uh, didn't present its case  effectively.  You testified for...  I was surprised, because I was a fan.  Uh, I was surprised when you testified, uh, for the defense.  It actually made me kind of question, like, well, you know, what, what kind of evidence 
[00:24:30]  must they have then, because they got Dr. Biden testifying?  What was, what was the basis of them asking you to testify?  Well, I, the basis, there were two bases, which, um, and one has to be careful in, in  these cases.  We don't testify, I don't testify as to guilt or innocence.  Right.  I testify as to certain points, and with every medical exam that testifies in, in a case,  then, like an O.J., there might have been 50 or 60 other people testifying.  Uh, who may have had more impact on the jury.  But one of the things was that the, the medical examiner testified from the stab wound of the 
[00:25:00]  young man Goldman's, uh, uh, body that the person who did the, um, uh, who did the stabbing  was right-handed, about six feet tall, and, uh, stabbed him, uh, from the front.  Um, and I, as I, you can't tell that from an, an unwitness stabbing, it could have been  a midget stabbing him, who was left-handed, stabbing him from the back.  Yeah, I always thought that was a little odd on TV shows, especially where they're like, 
[00:25:30]  he's obviously, he was right-handed.  Yeah, that's right.  And you're like, what?  He voted Democrat.  Look at the stab wound.  You see, unless, unless somebody sees the positions they're in, facing each other or something,  um, there's no hint at whether it's left-handed or right-handed.  And that was one of the issues that I testified.  It's, it's that they, it added in a lot of bad, bad information with the good information.  They had a lot of good information.  I think the DNA evidence was really good, except that it was presented, it was presented 
[00:26:00]  wonderful for a physician.  I loved their five days of testimony on DNA, uh, but somebody who just graduated from high  school isn't going to understand what they said.  That's one of the things that we're very, uh, concerned about, uh, in testimony is how  does the jury understand what we're saying?  Right.  It's like, you must have guests who will come in and they'll say wonderful things in PhD  terms that are true, but nobody understands.  Right, right.  And I think that's partly what happened in OJ also. 
[00:26:30]  So there's like a real, okay, there's a misconception.  Testifying for the defense just means that they called you to talk about a certain piece of  medical evidence, but it does get presented like, oh, Dr.  Biden must've thought he was innocent because he was, I agree.  I'm glad you said that.  That doesn't at all mean that when I testify for the prosecution though, because 99% of  the time I, I work now with the New York state police.  I worked in New York city for 25 years.  We'd be called by the prosecutor to testify.  Sure.  Uh, I would hope that they got the right guy, but the, the, uh, thing about it would be that 
[00:27:00]  the, the testimony I give theoretically could be, uh, useful for either side.  Uh, and, um, uh, we have to be fair and now half the time in my, when I'm asked to testify  in private, I'll give an opinion and I won't be called to testify because my opinion doesn't  agree with the, um, uh, theory of the, of the defense attorneys.  So when I get to testify, it's because the, the lawyers think I'll be helpful, but at the  same time, um, you don't know, the public doesn't know all the times we don't testify 
[00:27:30]  because the, because your opinion is disagree.  Wow.  See, I'm glad, uh, I figured there was a reason for it, but it's like, you don't realize  like, oh, they would call different guys just to talk about one piece of the evidence.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah, look, if the prosecution is saying you can tell by stab wounds stuff about  a guy you can't tell.  That's right.  You know, all right, well, they got to bring in somebody to counter that.  What creeps you out?  Like, does any of this death stuff creep you out ever?  Yeah.  What would creep me out when I started and still is young kids and children who are, um, innocents. 
[00:28:00]  So much of what we do as medical examiners, the victim is often, um, uh, involved in the  death, you know, the, the alcoholic who gets in a fight or the drug addict who gets killed  by a pusher or in a family affair, the, the spouse who's been in a terrible marriage and  fighting and all that for years.  And one kills the other, uh, there's, it's, it's all sad, but there's, uh, an understanding 
[00:28:30]  of that when a parent or a stranger kills a kid, um, uh, who's perfectly innocent, especially  when I had kids the same age, it really was creepy.  Even this creepy, this Kaylee case, that's a Kaylee Anthony that's going on now in Florida.  Um, is this the guy who killed the little brother and it's just, I'm not sure.  This is the mom.  This is the mom.  Who's in jail and refused to say what happened to her.  Yeah.  The kid is missing.  Three year old kid.  Yep.  That's really creepy because he has an innocent kid and obviously there are things going 
[00:29:00]  on that, uh, um, are upsetting.  Can you think of one case though that was the most, like, I guess it's hard when you look  at, say, 10 different stranger children, you can't pick which one, but is there one that  stands out for you that was just the most enraging or the most, uh, upsetting?  Well, the only one I ever cried at, I actually cried when I was asked to be ahead of the-  Pussy.  I'm kidding.  It is, it is, okay, no, no, no, no, it's sensitive. 
[00:29:30]  I'm sensitive.  I had to.  The, the only one that I, that I really, tears came out was when I examined the Kennedy,  John F. Kennedy autopsy for the Select Committee on Assassinations that was established back  in 1978, 79 to review the deaths of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King.  And I looked at that autopsy in the photographs and there was such a terrible kind of autopsy 
[00:30:00]  and photographs where there wasn't a proper cleaning of the body and the proper attention  paid, you know, to show our president who had been killed and to show what I would consider  not proper respect for the remains, what really upset me, apart from the fact that they got  the, uh, the entrance and the exit, uh, and the trajectory wrong, you know, in our president,  uh, when, when the, that autopsy was done by hospital pathologists who, uh, never had any 
[00:30:30]  experience doing gunshot wounds.  And one of the problems, uh, when I started out in the sixties, 80%, 85% of murders in New  York City were, were, uh, solved.  Now, counterintuitively, it's down to about 49% solved.  With all the new DNA and all the new stuff.  And part, and that's around the country.  And part of the problem from around the country that the solve rate for murders has gone down  so, so much is because the people doing the autopsies are hospital pathologists, uh, largely 
[00:31:00]  who, uh, do not know about gunshot wounds and stab wounds as with president Kennedy.  Wow.  And that's still a situation in this country.  They're, they're good, um, uh, pathologists to look into cancer and heart disease and natural  disease that kill 92% of people.  But the 8% of people, accident, suicide, homicide, that medical examiners deal with forensic  pathologists, there are probably less than 400 pathologists in the country compared to  800,000 doctors. 
[00:31:30]  And most of the murders today, 50 murders in the United States today will be done by,  uh, the autopsy will be done by pathologists who are not qualified to do those.  50 murders or 50%?  50 murders.  About 50 murders a day in the United States.  Oh, we did, okay, okay.  I'm sorry.  And, uh, hospital pathologists do the autopsies who are not trained in forensics.  And that's one of the reasons that even with the better forensics we have, the people doing  the autopsies aren't, as with John F. Kennedy.  Was he, uh, shot from the front or the back, do you think?  He was shot twice and only twice from the back. 
[00:32:00]  And, uh, one missed.  The first one misses.  Second one, um, uh, hits, uh, him in the, uh, back and goes into John F. Kennedy.  The, uh, Connelly, Governor Connelly says, he hears a shot and he starts turning around.  That shot, he thinks hit the president, but it missed.  It hit the curb.  When the second shot comes in, he's partially turned to look at what happened.  And that's why that, uh, gunshot wound is thought to be curbs around.  Oh, because he's turned around a little bit. 
[00:32:30]  Because he's turned into a straight line, uh, through his back into his left thigh.  And they're assuming he's sitting there straight, but he's not.  Which he wasn't.  And then the third, and he might have survived that one, but the third shot, um, is, uh,  the one that kills him.  That's in the line of fire with, uh, oh yeah, yeah.  Movie about that.  Also about the, uh, these, I know the house select commission, commission on the staff station  in 78, they, they actually said that they're, I guess through acoustics, they did acoustic  cast. 
[00:33:00]  They thought that there might have been a fourth bullet and they said that they think there  definitely was, but now they're going back on that.  That's a very good question.  And the reason it's a good question goes back.  Our forensic pathology panel concluded two and only two shots from behind from where  Oswald was, but there are other experts, just like in every trial, just like with OJ and  the experts in the acoustical trial said there was a fourth shot, which I, which there's no  evidence from the autopsy.  Um, so they concluded that it was a conspiracy because the fourth shot would have been too 
[00:33:30]  close to the third shot to have to reload.  It was like a second apart.  Wasn't it a, uh, they said it was a policeman's motorcycle audio that had been left on and  now, but then they said later, maybe it was the wrong mic that they had thought.  So what they were hearing was actually a noise from somewhere else and not part of the  assassination.  Yeah, that's right.  And the policeman whose car it was, whose motorcycle it was with the mic that presumed  was open that they heard the fourth shot on, he, he denied that it was his, that it was 
[00:34:00]  his, uh, radio that was on.  He just has consistently denied it.  And, um, I think that the noise I've listened to that, uh, just a lot of static.  You guys would probably have heard it.  There was a nice little professor from Queens college who said it was a fourth shot, but  there's no evidence, no other evidence, no evidence in the body, no evidence.  So you have no doubt Oswald did this, huh?  That's correct.  No, no question.  His fingerprint, his handprint is on the weapon.  He purchased the weapon under a false name.  No, no. 
[00:34:30]  And the trajectory lines up to where, uh, the, um, if you assume that, uh, Connelly is sitting,  turning slightly to, to look at, of course he was a hunter and he heard the first shot  and he recognized it as a shot, which didn't hit anybody, except you can see on one of the  Zapruder films where it struck the curb.  And then the second shot hits the president and Connelly.  And there was also JFK too.  It's funny.  It was, was on a seat that was raised a little bit and it was more towards the middle where 
[00:35:00]  all the old diagrams, like they showed Connelly facing forward Kennedy, but Kennedy was to  Connelly's left, I believe a little bit.  So the trajectory does line up a little bit better.  Yeah.  And he was, he was, they said that he was kind of, uh, slumped down, which is why the  suit jacket was raised.  All these things that the, the conspiracy nuts.  The, the, the thing about it is that, uh, the, Connelly was on a jump seat in front.  So it was lowered down and to the left, a little bit to, to the left of, uh, Kennedy sitting  behind him, you know, jump.  And that, if you take it all into account, it's clear, uh, and we concluded, uh, almost 
[00:35:30]  unanimously, uh, that, um, uh, that bullet, that the second bullet that, um, Oswald shot,  struck Kennedy in the back, went through his chest, uh, went through his neck, sorry, and  into, and to Connelly's chest and into his thigh.  Wow.  That's the so-called magic bullet.  The whole, uh, autopsy thing, uh, where it was so, you know, uh, dirty and, uh, it seemed 
[00:36:00]  like it wasn't, uh, like, was that just business as usual back then or?  Yes.  That was business as usual.  Wow.  Except it was the one thing.  And this is, uh, one of the things that hospital, when hospital pathologists do work, I do autopsy  and people die of cancer and heart disease and people evaporate upon, they'll have the chairman  of the surgery department and the residents and interns there to, to learn from it and  to give information about how the, what went wrong in the operation, for example.  Here, when the president is killed, you can't, when medical examiners do autopsy, you can't 
[00:36:30]  have interested people in the autopsy room.  The autopsy room belongs to the pathologist in charge of doing the autopsy.  And what was happening in, in, um, the Kennedy autopsy is that there were admirals and cabinet  members, uh, in the autopsy room who shouldn't have been there and, uh, giving him orders.  And we asked him, I interviewed, uh, Dr. Humes, who, in Washington, we interviewed him. 
[00:37:00]  I said, had you ever done an autopsy on a gunshot victim before?  No.  Uh, did you tell this to the, to the, uh, people who asked you to do the autopsy?  You should get a medical examiner, not a hospital pathologist.  And he said, look, when all these generals and admirals are there, we don't say anything.  Wow.  They tell us to do something, we do it.  Wasn't he military too, doctor?  Wasn't he military and kind of more subject to orders than somebody else?  Yes, yes.  He was a commander.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, and, uh, he was stationed at the hospital and he just so happened. 
[00:37:30]  And they took the body illegally from Dallas, where they had an excellent forensic pathologist  who'd done hundreds of gunshot wound and rifle wound, uh, autopsies and brought it up to,  uh, illegally to, cause it was at that time a state crime, uh, to, uh, Washington DC where  the doctors who did the autopsy had no experience doing the, uh, gunshot wound cases.  Why'd they do that?  Did they ever say why they did that?  They say they did it because the secret service felt that this might be a conspiracy and they'll 
[00:38:00]  be after Jackie Kennedy.  They're going to shoot other people.  We had to get the, and there was a confrontation.  The medical examiner in, um, in, um, Dallas said, stood at the, um, emergency room door  in the hospital and said, you can't take the body out of here.  This is a state of Texas, Dallas County case.  It's illegal to move the body.  And the secret service there and they, and they had the Dallas police in the, in the,  um, emergency room had a brief confrontation and there was a concern of some people that 
[00:38:30]  they were going to draw guns and start shooting.  But, uh, even though, uh, there was this objection, the decision was made to overrule the, uh, medical  examiner in Dallas and to move the body down to, uh, Washington, which was a big mistake.  And I think a lot of the, there'll always be, uh, questions, but a lot of the questions  that have risen about, uh, autopsy, uh, uh, misfindings, because the autopsy report has  a lot of incorrect information, um, would have been avoided if a proper forensic pathologist 
[00:39:00]  had done the autopsy as was present in Dallas.  What about the brain?  They lost his brain.  Is that true?  Yeah.  The brain, see, one of the things that medical examiners have to do is look at the brain  to gunshot wound to the brain.  So instead of examining the brain right away, Dr. Humes put it in formaldehyde to test it,  to examine it, you know, a few weeks after it was hardened and then it disappeared. 
[00:39:30]  Wow.  In my further investigations later on, it sounded, what I was able to include was, of course,  we interviewed lots, lots of people about where's the brain, you know?  Um, and, um, uh, we were able to determine, uh, and we interviewed the, the, um, uh, gravediggers  that anybody come in, put the brain in.  It's like old Catholic and old Jewish tradition is when the body's buried, it should be, all  the pieces should be put in so God can fix it.  Uh, and, um, what happened here is that the, um, uh, gravediggers said nobody ever came, but 
[00:40:00]  then we found out that there was a midnight vigil when the body was removed from the temporary,  uh, grave to the eternal light where it is now, it is now around midnight where a number  of people, including Bobby Kennedy came, no gravediggers were there and he put the material  into the cast, near the, next to the casket.  And that's where the brain probably is next to the casket in, uh, Arlington Cemetery. 
[00:40:30]  And wait, so they would never allow the body to be exhumed, right?  Is that what it was?  Well, that would have been an issue.  You see, we considered that, and I had to discuss, uh, with other people there, whether  we should ask for the body to be exhumed, which the family wouldn't have, uh, wanted.  They, they made it clear they didn't want, uh, uh, exhumation.  And there was an issue.  What if we want, thought it was necessary, they go to court.  And we decided independently that, look, um, if the family doesn't want it, and since we  have all the information we need to explain the bullet trajectories and the cause of death, 
[00:41:00]  that we shouldn't press for it.  And we didn't press for an exhumation.  Should see if the, uh, Eric Nagel brain is, uh, also deep in that grave.  It's one of our employees.  Yes.  He's hoping he could do an autopsy.  He's been found.  We're getting at it.  Actually, he just has a stem.  It's amazing.  There's nothing after the stem, and he still functions and walks around.  We think it's all motor reflexes.  And as they say, they think that lawyers work like that, too. 
[00:41:30]  Why don't we, uh, Dr. Quincy, douchebag?  Oh, no.  Quincy was, Quincy was very good.  Except what Quincy shows, what the, what the problems are with CSI and all that, is that,  um, you can't just let a case develop normally because it's too boring.  You gotta have the CSI person do the DNA in three minutes, or else you don't have a show  in that show.  So, uh, there's a lot of information given these programs that isn't quite true, like  Quincy.  Well, Quincy, it seemed Quincy was always out there, and, and people were shooting at Quincy 
[00:42:00]  sometimes.  Yeah, that, that, that, that's the kind that doesn't happen.  With Quincy and the CSI, the one person does everything.  Yeah, yeah.  He does the autopsy, goes to the scene, he interviews people, all which doesn't happen.  A young girl was murdered, doctor.  I disagree.  You sit around, I go out and find who did it.  Yeah, very good.  Very, very, very good.  But the thing about it is, I think the public, this is the problem I have with Quincy and  other shows, the public, um, um, realizes at some level that this is all video, uh, license, 
[00:42:30]  you know, that they're allowed to do things that aren't real.  One person doesn't do six different jobs in real life.  They realize that.  What they don't realize is that all cases don't get solved.  The, the, the thing about OJ Simpson, how come only OJ Simpson, uh, uh, you know, he's  only high, high profile cases in Hollywood don't get solved.  Uh, more than half the murders in the United States don't get solved. 
[00:43:00]  Mm.  See, uh, more, I, I don't think anybody's done studies.  Forty, thirty percent of people who commit murders wind up getting convicted.  Well, in L.A. it's probably going to be ten percent with their horrendous prosecution.  Did they, did they blow the Menendez?  They blew, they blew OJ.  They blew a lot of big cases, right?  Well, but.  Maybe if they were doing a case.  They don't, they don't, not everybody gets convicted.  Look at Louisiana, in New Orleans, where they got, what, a two percent, uh, uh, solve  rate for murders, you know, since Katrina.  Two percent?  Yeah, they're less than two percent. 
[00:43:30]  I think there's one murder conviction in New Orleans, partly, I think, because of the  very weak, very weak district attorney's office.  Oh, how he's got it?  How did he catch the one guy?  How bad was the one guy who got caught?  What did he do?  He kept confessing.  In the judge's chair?  Confessing.  Hey, let's take a quick break and continue.  Okay.  Hi, this is Jimmy Smith, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  And now, the worst. 
[00:44:00]  Just pathetic.  Of Opie and Anthony.  They call it toilet humor.  Toilet humor.  We're going to start today's festivities.  I got in front of me a water bug.  We have roaches here.  It's fucking annoying.  We, yeah.  I don't want it near me.  This fucking place is disgusting.  The food.  If you go around that side there and make the left where the refrigerator is, they scurry.  They scurry like the fucking pieces of shit they are. 
[00:44:30]  And I mean the interns.  And then the cockroaches are even worse.  What do you want roaches to do?  Hang out and wait for a fucking, no one's going to go.  A shoe.  A shoe.  Wait for a big shoe.  Ladies and gentlemen.  That's a big one, too.  The first of many.  Holy fuck.  Get that out of here.  What are you, crazy?  Dude, it's in the machine now.  What the fuck?  Are you nuts?  I don't want the roach on me.  Oh.  I'm done.  Get my truck.  I'm out of here. 
[00:45:00]  Dude, why didn't you fucking...  Dude, are you crazy?  You're not going to find it now.  It's crazy.  Well, step on it.  You guys are fucking talking to it.  Kill the fucking thing.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  God almighty.  We're all reacting like Steve C. looking at a pussy.  All right, listen.  Do you got it?  You got it, because I want to fuck it. 
[00:45:30]  Those are fucking disgusting.  You better have smashed that thing.  Smash it.  Smash it.  Smash it.  Kill it.  Keep it away from Poe, because he's afraid of them.  Poe hates him.  Kill it.  There he's a ball.  Wow, nice move, Dan.  Show him to Poe.  I want to see Poe freak out.  Where's Poe?  Poe, come here.  Poe!  Hey, Dan, how about you show him away from my chair?  By my fucking food prep area here.  I have a sandwich.  No, no, no.  Keep him away.  Why, he's a brooch?  No, no, no. 
[00:46:00]  That's right.  No, no.  Keep him away.  No, no.  Keep him away.  Poe really is scared of cockroaches?  No, no, no.  Keep him away.  I can't touch me.  Well, he is Puerto Rican.  I know.  They're like fucking...  I'm sure he's trying to name it already.  Yeah.  All right, Poe, get over there.  Come on, Poe.  You're a fucking martial artist.  Dude, that's a big...  Did you just give it breathing holes?  That's very courteous, Dan.  There's enough air in that cup for a year for that fucking little thing.  Fucking Ray doesn't kill them.  You already have to pass out.  Just glad you gave it...  Why don't you bring it some milk?  Yeah.  They eat shit, Dan.  Give it a little treat.  This is the first of many that are going to be caught, but let Poe take a look at the 
[00:46:30]  cockroach.  Why do you want me to look at him?  He's underneath the cup.  He's safe.  He's going to run.  We want to see who would win, Master Poe or a cockroach.  He won.  Hands down.  All right.  Reveal the cockroach.  No, I'm going to kill it, though.  All right.  Then you kill it.  Let's see.  Wait.  To reveal it, though.  Fight it, Poe.  Fight it.  Fight the cockroach.  You want me to fight the cockroach?  Wait.  Give the cockroach a running start. 
[00:47:00]  It was on his back when we recaptured it.  Wait, Paul, you have to take this thing off.  Hold on.  No.  No.  Danny will take it off to make sure it starts running.  I want to give this thing a chance.  But it's going to run away from him.  No, it's not.  I'm going to kill it.  I'm going to kill it.  No, just not.  What are we doing?  Bobby.  He's going to kill it.  Give me a stick.  Get me my stick.  Where's my stick?  Are you ready?  Where's my stick?  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Give me my stick.  My stick.  I need my stick.  Danny, is it going to run when you lift it up?  Dude, I can kill it.  It wants to leave that cup immediately.  Okay.  Here we go.  Without the broom.  Here we go. 
[00:47:30]  Wait, hold on.  Poe versus the cockroach.  Hold on.  I have to get my weapon.  You don't need a weapon.  What are you going to run?  Bobby, you've got to get near it.  He's going to run.  All right.  Here we go.  Danny's going to...  One, two, three.  Oh, damn.  Fucking damn.  You've been polled.  Wow.  You used every muscle in your leg to do that.  Puerto Rican accuracy.  I love it.  I'm used to it.  A lot of practice.  I love how you strutted around like you just kicked the shit out of something a trillionth 
[00:48:00]  of your size.  You'd think that was fucking Randy Cotoro for him.  You went down, bitch.  That's right.  I'm not even looking at his eyes anymore.  You can't be more dead than that cockroach is right now.  Not at all.  That was a direct hit.  Oh, boy.  Well, we've been talking about the cockroaches.  See, Bobby, we told you cockroaches in the drop ceiling yesterday.  You've got to wear bullshit.  But that's the one thing that is true.  There are a lot of cockroaches in this building now.  And he was fast.  Or in this area.  Well, this is what we want to do. 
[00:48:30]  We want to do cockroach wars with the interns.  Cockroach wars?  Yeah, we want them to set up traps this weekend and see who could, you know.  Oh, like a hunt.  Yeah, see who could.  We want cockroach hunting.  See who could capture the most cockroaches between now and Monday.  Cream Pie Jones said he would eat a cockroach.  Well, there it is on the floor.  Right there.  Lick it up, motherfucker.  No, don't do it.  That's not good.  Cream Pie.  Cream.  It's sanitary, right?  That's a fucking roach.  Roach.  Fucking roach.  Don't do it, dude. 
[00:49:00]  Don't do it.  Cream Pie, get on all fours.  Get out of the way, Sam.  Get out of the way, Sam.  I want the audience.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  You've got to be kidding me.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Oh.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  He has picked up the cockroach.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  He's showing it around.  You've got to be kidding.  And.  Boo.  Boo.  He's opening his mouth.  He's teasing the audience.  Oh, shit. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, God.  Holy shit.  Oh, fuck.  He ate a cockroach.  Spits on the floor.  Post dry heaving.  Oh.  Dude, you are worse than Asians.  Oh, man.  He ate something that touched a Puerto Rican.  Post dry heaving over here.  All right.  Very, very good.  Cream Pie Jones. 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  That was really unbelievable.  Don't ever speak to me again.  So we're going to do cockroach wars.  That was a hell of a closer.  Are people working on their trapping devices?  What do we got so far?  I don't like cockroach wars.  It sounds like you want fighting cockroaches.  All right.  What do you want to call it?  Like some kind of hunt thing.  Cockroach hunt?  Cockroach hunt.  Okay.  Whackaroach.  So far, Cream Pie Jones and Hip Hop Ron have both gotten strongly behind this thing.  And they're both competing with each other. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, really?  I feel like you guys have moved past the dude eating a fucking giant cockroach pretty quick.  Anyway, so now what do we do now?  You know what?  We are so desensitized at this point.  We talk about it from time to time.  That stomach is so fucking nice.  That's why we like guys in here that aren't as desensitized.  We've seen it all at this point.  He wore, uh, Cream Pie Jones actually wore a shit hat.  I took a dump at CBS.  It was a fucking pile of nastiness.  And he fucking put his hands in the toilet. 
[00:51:00]  And he put a, it was called a duty hat.  He made a duty hat.  He made a duty hat.  Jesus Christ.  Big boy made a duty.  This was on two separate occasions, though.  There was one occasion of the duty hat.  And then there was another occasion of him just lifting up what looked like a pulled pork sandwich out of the toilet bowl.  And then waved goodbye to it and put it back and flushed it away.  Bye, and he had to say, bye-bye, duty.  We got to show him that video.  We had it.  Big boy makes a duty.  We were extremely disappointed that this didn't take the internet by storm, by the way, Greg. 
[00:51:30]  How could it not?  I think we had 112 people view this video.  There's a guy wearing a shit hat and that didn't get any views.  What do you got to do to get anybody's attention?  Yeah, really.  Yeah.  I want to talk about the cockroaches as he finds that video.  Now, how many cockroaches have we really seen?  Oh, so fucking many back there.  Have you seen them, man?  Yes.  I'm hearing just rumors.  I haven't seen them.  There have been sightings.  Like, people who have come here and have seen them right where the new studio comes in, right where the audience is. 
[00:52:00]  There's at least two seen there.  When they were cleaning the back sink, like the first clean that happened at the beginning of the week, they found six in one shot.  Like, six just started running around.  Do we know where they might be hiding?  In that sink.  In the back sink.  Yeah, there's two fridges.  There's the front fridge and then the rear fridge and the Rana Fez office.  The front fridge, if anybody has anything in there, just forget about it.  Don't put anything in that fridge.  I've opened that fridge and seen roaches running inside of the fridge.  They creep up on you. 
[00:52:30]  How the fuck did they get in there?  I don't know, but the roaches live in the ice in that fridge.  Like, the ice maker has ice and roaches in it, and the roaches are moving around.  They're fucking dinosaurs.  Right now?  I don't know if they're there now, but...  Someone go look.  I really want to find, like...  Because they say if you see a couple, that means there's hundreds, possibly thousands.  That means there's a million.  All right, where are they then?  There's got to be a place where they're really hiding.  We found at least a dozen here this week.  This week alone?  Yeah.  And how are we going to capture these things?  Get some glue traps. 
[00:53:00]  Okay.  Glue traps.  Glue traps for roaches?  Yeah, yeah.  That'll work?  Absolutely.  Restaurants do that.  You lay them out because when it gets dark, they come running around, you know, trying to  find food.  And then they go, whoa!  And they get stuck.  Yeah, because we've got to have proof.  Yeah.  Jim, how can you eat after that?  I could eat...  There's nothing I can't eat through.  Dude, how about we get...  How about we all...  How about this?  We all get a glue...  We all get a glue trap.  It's like...  It's just a piece of paper with really heavy glue on it.  Uh-huh. 
[00:53:30]  And we all write our names on each one.  And then we see which one gets the most cockroaches between now and Monday.  So he gets best placement, though.  Yeah.  Everybody picks their own place.  Yeah, but everyone's going to pick by the fridge.  No, it's not by the fridge.  I want under the fridge.  I got under the fridge.  I get the spot near Erock's mouth.  I say bait.  Everybody has to choose their own bait style.  There's a shitting rhinoceros caught in yours.  They're not going to get away from a glue trap, I'm telling you. 
[00:54:00]  At least we'll have...  For Erock.  Any chance to rag on Erock?  Let's get some...  Oh, fuck.  So why don't we get those glue things, and we'll start there.  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy.  I love it. 
[00:54:30]  Did they check behind the refrigerator?  I don't know.  That's a good idea.  We're going to do that right now.  If you pull that fridge out, it's just going to look like...  All right, Sam, why don't you do that?  Get a mic, though.  Mr. Pratt's apartment from fucking...  Hip-hop, is that on?  Creepshow.  Yeah, it's done.  Yeah, there it is.  All right.  Fucking creepshow.  All right, they're going to the back fridge.  What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?  Bugs got your tongue?  What?  Oh, there it is.  They found one?  Yeah, Creepi found one.  Oh, look at this. 
[00:55:00]  Wait, shit.  Check out the new ice maker.  Yeah, Pat, the ice maker.  I just checked the ice maker.  All right, they're checking around the...  What?  Whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  That's why I love the show.  Full volume, thank you.  I wrote you.  Ah, shit.  Fucking sad.  Mr. Pratt.  Mr. Pratt.  You got it? 
[00:55:30]  Ugh.  Sam, what do we got?  Pat's up, he's got one.  Pat's picking him up with his hands.  How many?  No.  There's one baby.  Seven?  Seven?  They're all over.  It's infested.  I swear to God, it is infested.  We just moved a file cabinet.  They found one.  Then they moved a garbage can.  They started yelling because there was three behind a garbage can.  They're all over.  When you have that many roaches with this much daylight activity, you have a fucking problem.  This place is fucking infested. 
[00:56:00]  Duffy has two baby ones.  Two babies.  Good, Duffy.  Just smashing the place apart.  I love that one minute you're deconstructing those subtleties of the legal system, and the  next minute there's people licking the back of the fridge for roaches.  Yeah, so multifaceted program we have here.  That's right here.  What?  There's two little ones right here.  You got two little ones?  Yeah.  What do you tend to do to them?  I could snort them. 
[00:56:30]  What are they, babies?  Yeah, they're little guys.  Would you do that?  Sure.  Wait, and now cream pie's coming in with more.  Oh, cream pie's stealing my thunder again.  What do you got, cream pie?  Just one.  Just one.  One little guy?  He ate one.  He did eat one.  Ugh.  Fucking things disgust me.  I think we're about to take out the microwave that's over there to see what's behind it.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's going to be an ugly scene.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Move the microwave.  This is so bad.  I would love to see this place at night.  All right.  This is so fucking bad. 
[00:57:00]  I'm always moving the microwave with a broomstick.  Somebody grab the microwave.  Grab it, it's going to fall.  Grab it, it's going to fall.  Get up.  Grab it, it's going to fall.  All right.  He's willing to snort the roaches, huh?  You guys are just sensitive.  Jesus, what happened?  How's a real man with this broom?  Nothing.  Well, they're scared now. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  More people over there.  That will get them out.  There's nothing behind the microwave, but right on top of the microwave is all old condiments  that have been there.  So that's what's being checked out right now.  Who puts food in there?  What?  Who puts food in there?  I don't know.  Who put it in there?  Who eats it?  Who would store that?  Who the fucking shitbox?  Jonathan Schwartz.  Oh, really?  Frank's place.  Frank's guys.  Fucking go out for lunch.  What do you guys make, eight grand a year?  There's shislers.  There's two more dead ones. 
[00:58:00]  Found two more?  Did you guys check under the sink?  Because I know that I went in there for paper towels the other day and a bunch ran out.  Oh, really?  All right, go under the sink.  Nothing under the sink right now?  There's nothing under the sink right now.  I left my cookies there, too, a couple days ago.  Oh, forget about those.  I'm kidding.  Let's see.  Oh, just say you took it.  They cleaned under the sink the other day.  That's where they found six in one shot.  Who's cleaning?  The interns.  Did any of them get in my bowl of oatmeal?  Yeah.  Exactly.  So we're going to do cockroach hunting, all right? 
[00:58:30]  Get those glue things.  We'll give it the weekend so they can kind of re-accumulate.  Yeah.  They'll fuck, have kids.  The kids will fuck, have kids.  We throw that glue shit down now.  That's just the Puerto Ricans.  And we'll capture a lot.  Let's say hi to Mike in Michigan.  Mike?  Mike?  Yeah.  Hey, Mike.  Hey.  If you open the microwave up or back of your televisions up, you'll find even more.  They like the electronics.  Yep. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Great.  Let's go to Andy in Indiana.  Andy?  Yeah, I just wanted to warn you guys.  If you're stomping on those roaches, that's what releases the eggs.  It's going to cause a bigger infestation.  Shut up.  These guys.  Not if we get interns to eat it.  Yeah, not that.  They like it.  Like, there are some...  Let's say hi to Darwin in Newark. 
[00:59:30]  I just think it's funny, by the way, that we would actually have a glue trap by Erock's  mouth, but a shitting rhinoceros is such a big animal.  Yes.  To stick in a glue trap.  And then to discover it.  That would have to be the weakest shitting right off of you.  Oh, yeah.  Can't get out of that glue trap.  What's up, Darwin?  Yo, you guys are smart as hell. 
[01:00:00]  X-Men cannot afford to get an exterminator, so he got you guys to manipulate a way to get  these guys to do the job for them.  Very nice.  Cool.  Mental focal.  Yeah, well, X-Men hasn't really done any upkeep lately.  No, they don't have enough money for much of anything.  Cockroaches.  Yes, Sam.  I think I might know one of the reasons that Cockroaches is there.  Behind that file cabinet where we just found a bunch, we also found an old bottle of Erock's  Hawaiian Punch.  Erock. 
[01:00:30]  Ladies, ladies and gentlemen, Green Pie Jones.  Green Pie Jones.  What do you want me to do?  They wanted me in a cumzies.  Cumzies.  Green Pie.  She's squeezing his honey.  Green Pie.  Touching his penis.  Green Pie.  That's a full erection.  Green Pie.  Oh, my God.  Green Pie.  She's stuck in my titty.  Green Pie.  I'm such a worm.  Green Pie.  He's turning off on a pit.  Green Pie.  Oh, my God.  Ah, ah, ah, oh, shit.  I think he made the cumzies. 
[01:01:00]  He made the cumzies.  The cumzies.  He made the cumzies.  He made the cumzies.  The cumzies.  Green Pie.  Green Pie.  What brilliant new stunt is Pat doing for the Opie and Anthony show now?  Hey, don't expect me to supply you with anything.  Pat Duffy, everyone.  He's right over there.  Hello.  Hey, Pat, you got a stump for everybody today?  Sure.  I wanted to stick those in my nose, the bugs.  I don't know if you want to do that or not.  You want to snort up the baby cockroaches?  Or I could brush my teeth with those bugs. 
[01:01:30]  I have a toothbrush in my backpack.  I say he snorts up the baby cockroaches.  Yeah, snorting cockroaches would be good.  I like the fact that we're glancing over, brush your teeth with roaches like it's old hat.  Yeah.  Well, that's how you do dog shit.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to top dog shit.  Hey, snazzy dresser, is your mic working?  Yeah, my mic's off.  Greg, have you ever seen Two Girls, One Cup, that video?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I know.  Because I was saying, you know, if you're grossed out by that, I mean, that...  I know.  That was pretty dumb.  That fucking video.  That's kind of silly.  Are they still alive in there, the baby cockroaches?  Yeah.  How are you going to snort them? 
[01:02:00]  I don't know.  I was just going to kind of...  Can I kill them first?  So they don't curl in my brain and kill them?  Yeah.  I mean, if you're a pussy, sure.  Yeah.  I say kill them first.  I really don't think there's a way to get from your nose to your brain.  Yeah.  Unless they have fucking...  Well, goddammit, I was trying to think of a small brain joke.  Couldn't.  Asshole I am.  Are they dead?  They are now.  All right.  Lay them on the table in front of everybody.  All right.  Yeah, how about that table?  Which one else?  Yeah, they have the clear one over there in front of the whole crowd.  The whole crowd, see?  Yeah.  Dump out the cockroaches. 
[01:02:30]  No, don't knock the roaches.  The audience will prove that this is real.  There you go.  Oh, God.  That's fine.  He's just struggling.  God damn you will always stand in my way, Sam.  Are you going to use a straw?  What, are you going to use a straw?  That doesn't help your big fucking head of hair.  You fucking Boondocks comic strip looking motherfucker.  Jesus.  All right.  All right.  Pat Duffy's going to snort baby cockroaches. 
[01:03:00]  He hit hip hop Ron in the balls.  Yeah, he's just deciding him a ball shot.  Here we go.  Oh, you heard him.  Let each one go off.  Oh, man.  I felt that. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  They're in.  Delicious.  That's a fucking man's man.  You heard him.  He's going.  Yeah.  Like it made the sound.  He's just punching him in the balls.  All right, then.  Holy shit.  Where are they lodged right now?  I feel too good down my throat.  And then I'm not sure where the other one is.  Oh, sinus laying its eggs.  Iraq's having a slight problem in there.  I was just going to say.  Iraq, you all right?  What's wrong?  Bring him in.  Bring Iraq in.  Iraq, come in here, young Iraq.  We miss you.  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  Look at how bad he's gotten.  Dude, dude, yeah, please.  Let's really look.  Yeah, I know.  Wow.  I noticed this morning, yeah.  No, I'm not there yet, but I almost threw up on the board.  What's it going to take?  Do we have more bugs?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we want to get Iraq puking today.  I know.  What's on the board?  A mirror?  Wow, same joke several times.  You're right.  Sorry. 
[01:04:30]  Iraq, Jimmy noticed that you might have gained a few LBs.  What's going on?  I actually didn't notice.  Why are you getting LBs again?  What happened?  I didn't even notice.  I'm back to 210.  Fine.  What were you down to?  29.  For that diet thing, I was at 195, but I'm at 210 again.  Jeez.  What happened?  I don't know.  Food.  Food happened. 
[01:05:00]  Well, look.  This is the beginning of one of the duty videos, and it's visibly.  I mean, you were...  You look a lot thinner than that.  A lot.  That is pretty funny that you were skinny, and then you watched someone eat shit, and  that inspired you to eat a lot.  You'd think it might have had the opposite.  Hey, can we put Iraq on the scale?  I don't think he's 210, by the way.  I think he might be a little more than that.  I bet you he's wearing those boxer briefs, and I'll be fucking goddamned if he doesn't  look good in boxer briefs.  By the way, Iraq...  In boxer briefs.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Iraq loves smelling fart boxes. 
[01:05:30]  No, he doesn't.  Does anyone have anything going on today in their pants?  I've had the same pair of pants for a week.  No.  You?  Yeah.  Would you smell...  My asshole.  No.  Come on.  No.  Would you stink your asshole?  Probably.  I've had the same underwear on for a week.  Since the ass smelling contest, which was already three days in, so that's eight days.  Because I have very poor hygiene and no money to buy new underwear.  Do you have one pair of underwear?  I have four.  Do you put the other one on?  Four pairs of underwear.  Are you guys really questioning the underwear-wearing habits of a guy that just fucking snorted  a whole... 
[01:06:00]  You know, you're right.  You mean no dry cleaning patches?  Yeah, wait a minute.  Uh...  We should do it for Geraldo, though.  I forgot.  He's fucking...  He's a great comic.  He's doing a virus show.  Would you just sniff...  What do we gotta do?  We love Geraldo.  You just have to watch.  It's wonderful.  It's good.  It's a wonderful sight.  Iraq, for the big studio audience.  It might not even stink.  Duffy's ass didn't stink last time.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Iraq's looking for the garbage pill already.  You don't need it.  All right. 
[01:06:30]  This is so gay.  It's not gay.  You get a rod and you...  You get a...  All right.  You gotta drop...  Oh, Pat.  I think so.  Sure.  Wow.  Get a good one.  Wow.  Is that what that is?  Yeah.  What?  What are we looking at?  We're identifying what could be the adult penis and balls.  Allegedly genitals of a man. 
[01:07:00]  Yes.  Well, now I just feel sheepish.  Sheepish.  Sorry, Pat.  It's all right.  All right, Iraq.  All right, so Iraq.  You'll lose a few pounds here.  This is all...  You gotta move the garbage can.  That's in everybody's way.  Yeah.  All right.  Just for all the work I've ever done for you.  All right.  That's fair.  Yeah.  You gotta open the cheeks, Pat.  What are we, communist?  Oh, my God.  It's not gay.  Oh, yeah.  It's not gay.  It's gay not to right now. 
[01:07:30]  All right, Iraq.  Yeah.  Get down there.  Good.  I can't even get near it.  I'm starting to heave.  It's delicious.  It's delicious.  Jimmy, make sure he does it right.  You gotta get in there.  We want to smell the sniffing.  Sure, I'll be happy to help out, Hope.  I always get the fucking great jobs.  Make sure his nose is near his asshole.  All right.  Let's go.  My mic doesn't go any farther.  I was fucking happy.  Thanks, man.  Make sure you stay out of the way of that fucking thing or I kill. 
[01:08:00]  All right, here we go.  All right, you get in there.  This is for Greg Jerome.  Iraq, you kneel down first.  Iraq kneels down first.  And this way, don't watch your knees.  It might be dirty.  Now, you move back, Pat.  You can't touch him, but just bend forward.  Open your cheeks a little bit.  There you go.  Spread him up.  Come on.  Iraq, get in there.  Don't be a silly.  Don't be shy.  This makes me incredibly happy.  I can't even tell you.  Open him up, Pat.  What are you fucking...  What are you, communist?  Iraq.  Get a good whiff, Iraq. 
[01:08:30]  Get right in there.  Get in there.  You gotta get in there and get a good whiff.  Get right in there.  Iraq's dizzy.  I can see it.  Let me look here.  Iraq, Iraq, Iraq.  I don't need support on this.  Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq.  Wow.  What a deep asshole.  Oh, my God.  Holy crow.  We gotta hear the...  Iraq, you haven't even done it yet.  Iraq, you haven't even done it yet.  You didn't do anything, Iraq. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, God.  All right, get back in there.  Let's do it.  I gotta say, I'm looking at...  Because I like a girl with a deep asshole.  I like that.  Yeah.  Yours is fucking awful, but what a fucking horrible deep crevice he has.  If you were a chick, I'd fucking marry you.  Literally, it's probably an entire hand length deep before you get to the bum.  It's a fucking deep crack.  All right.  Spread him and let Iraq...  Come on, Iraq.  Iraq, get in there.  Get a good sniff.  Don't be a fag. 
[01:09:30]  Stick your face in his ass.  Don't let it air out.  Don't let it air out too much.  Come on, sniff.  It's gotta get that good...  Oh, my God.  Smell.  Jesus.  Get in there.  What are you doing, Eric?  Yeah, like you're on a fucking big rod.  Gotta get that good man-ass smell.  Here we go.  I can't get near it.  Get in there.  Get in there.  You can't get close.  You can't get in there.  That's just tasteless.  You can't get in there.  Come on, Iraq.  Get in there.  Come on, man.  I can't get near it.  I've seen a dude throw up before, but never for that reason. 
[01:10:00]  Get that nose in there.  All right.  Here we go.  Here he goes.  Oh, yes.  Holy fuck.  Oh, my God.  He pushed his ass into his face.  Oh, my God. 
[01:10:30]  He's got, like, a brown nose.  Oh.  What else is now?  Iraq, you all right?  I did.  How was it?  Oh, delightful.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, that is horrifying.  That's horrifying.  Smelled like gins.  Oh, God.  Pukes out.  Fantastic.  The teeth hurt?  Not this time, no.  This was...  The other time, it was puckering and, like, moving.  This just smells horrible. 
[01:11:00]  I can probably make his pucker if you want.  No.  All right.  That's Iraq, everyone.  Go Iraq, Iraq.  Hey, this is intern Pat Duffy, and you're listening to me desperately seek attention on the worst  of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:11:30]  This is Primetime Sam Roberts, and you're about to hear me light up a mic, as only I can do,  on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Rob Zombie, everybody.  Hi, Rob.  Hello.  Rob.  We haven't talked to you in many, many years.  We go way back.  Yeah?  We used to talk to you when we were at WAF, but I don't think...  Oh, right, yeah, yeah.  I don't think you would remember that.  Yes, I do. 
[01:12:00]  And then we talked to you when we were doing afternoons for a while.  Yeah, that was a while ago, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Man, we've had a few screw-ups since then, been around, but always land on our feet.  I'm very jealous of his friendship with Tom Papa.  Tom's a comedian.  Really?  You are?  Oh, it makes me sick.  I want to wreck it.  Because Tom's like the cleanest cut comic.  He's like, you know, he tours with Seinfeld as a Letterman guy, and him and Zombie are really  close, and it really bugs me.  How did that happen?  How did you meet Tom Papa?  I don't know, but everyone keeps asking me that. 
[01:12:30]  That was like a big topic yesterday, too.  Like, how would you know Tom Papa?  And it's a simple...  I couldn't even remember how I knew Tom Papa, because I was kind of thinking, like, yeah,  why do I know Tom Papa?  You're saying the same thing.  Why would I hang out with him?  But I remember we went...  Both flew across country to this...  Not together, but we ended up at this wedding together that was so boring that we just started  talking, and, you know, we just sort of bonded over the misery of being at this wedding.  And then we, you know...  That's all it takes sometimes, Jay. 
[01:13:00]  He's a funny guy.  Yeah, he's a really good comic.  I like funny guys.  It bothers me that somebody I'm friends with is friends with a rock star that I like.  Well, Jimmy, you being a comic also, you would think that you would have friends like  that.  You have, like, Sully from Godsmack.  Yes.  As a friend of yours.  Yes, he is.  Ozzy Osbourne.  Has no idea I'm alive.  You know...  Now, Sully's all insulted.  You said you don't know any rock stars, so he's like...  No, Sully...  I'm an Ozzy fan, and I watched him the other night.  He performed on the top of the hard rock, and me and Florentine stood for an hour and 
[01:13:30]  20 minutes and waited for him to come out the side door.  Really?  Like, what's wrong with me?  Like a kid.  I know!  You already have pictures with him?  You have every single thing you could possibly have of Ozzy.  There's nothing...  Rob, we've got to explain.  He has to get pictures with everybody that's famous, and Ozzy especially.  He's like an Uber fan.  But he's got multiple photographs with Ozzy.  He's got...  We go with him.  Audio, yeah.  He's got...  How many do you need?  That's what I'm saying.  No, I know!  This is going.  It's not...  Thank you.  You're not going to become friends with him. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, there's nothing...  How many times?  Thank you, Rob.  That's his fantasy.  That is his fantasy.  He doesn't want any friends.  This is what I want.  But Rob is right.  This is what I...  Where is this going is pretty much what I was saying to myself at 1130 at night.  I'm 39, and I'm waiting for a British alcoholic to walk out so I can just go,  Hi, remember me?  I didn't think you would.  Take care.  God bless.  He even has a picture with all of Black Sabbath when they were inducted into the Hall of Fame.  Yeah.  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  But here's what I want from Ozzy.  I want Ozzy to one time walk out, and I'll go, hey.  And they'll go, hey, Jim.  And keep going. 
[01:14:30]  That's all I want.  It'll never happen.  I know.  You could be on tour with him for a year, and it would, you know...  Oh, he doesn't form it.  No.  It's just how it is.  You've given him a new hope, though.  He's hoping someday it's like, Jimmy, isn't this a boring wedding?  It's so boring.  And it's mine.  I'm right.  You don't whore.  Sit down, Oz.  Let's get out of here.  Tom Papa will come in and C-block you from here, too.  I mean, I don't know.  Maybe Tom Papa.  You know, he'll hang out with you.  Yeah, he'll hook you up.  Hey, you do...  I'm really...  I'm also...  This is another thing that makes me very jealous and sick is that you get to work with Malcolm  McDowell, who's one of, you know, my all-time idols, obviously, from... 
[01:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  You get it bad, don't you?  Yeah.  I'm just an envious couple...  He's like a fanboy.  Yeah, he plays Dr. Loomis.  Oh, wow.  We're talking about Halloween, obviously.  Yeah.  We should be going up to speed.  The remake of Halloween, directed by Rob Zombie.  Are you considering it a remake, or is it a new vision?  I don't know.  Everything's just a new term for the same thing.  It's a remake, I guess.  There's a lot of new content, so a remake makes it sound like, you know, it's like a  shot-for-shot redo, which it's not, so... 
[01:15:30]  It's...  But, you know, it's the same story.  Yeah.  We have a lot more backstory and a lot more stuff added.  What about, I gotta ask you, the Captain Kirk mask.  Is that still a part of the...  Yeah, we...  I mean, that's really the only, you know, if you lose that...  The constant, yeah.  ...and people go, well, what the hell is it?  No, we went to a lot of trouble.  It's like Jason making a new Friday the 13th with a catcher's mask on or something.  You should have, yeah, a William Shatner mask of what he looks like today.  Yeah, but today it's the Priceline Shatner mask.  Right, right.  Age the mask like a Shatner age. 
[01:16:00]  Why Halloween?  Like, when did you say, all right, this is a movie I just want to redo?  Or do?  Well, I didn't...  I never thought about it before.  It just was one of those opportunities that came up and somebody offered it to me.  And at first I didn't want to do it.  I just thought maybe it was kind of a stupid idea.  But, you know, I went away and thought about it for a couple months and came up with a way  that I thought it could be done.  You'd do it differently.  And then, you know, what the hell?  Jumped in on it.  Why is it coming out?  Well, it's not coming out on Halloween.  It's coming out in September, right?  Yeah, I don't know.  August 31st?  August 31st, it comes out. 
[01:16:30]  I mean, I don't know.  That's fine with me.  If you come out...  I think that's smart, because then you'll get another little boost at the box office right  around Halloween.  Yeah, I mean, if it came out on Halloween by November 1st, everybody's like, eh, I'm  over it.  Yeah, you're done with Halloween.  Yeah, you're sick of it.  Yeah.  I always thought that it was stupid to have these movies come out right a couple days before  Halloween.  That's why every Christmas movie comes out in November, because if it came out on Christmas  the next day...  Once Christmas is over, it's over, yeah.  Nobody's going to see the Santa Claus 3.  It's the build-up to the holiday, I guess.  December 26th.  All right, good.  I'll show you that I've been in show business for 17 years, and I know nothing. 
[01:17:00]  Why not just release it on the same night?  All the kids will go.  Explains the Aussie scenario.  Is it the same music?  Is the same music in it?  The same theme?  Some of it, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we took the same music and redid it a little bit, so it's a little different,  but it's pretty close.  Rocked it up a little bit?  Not really, because whenever we tried to jazz it up or anything, it sounded kind of like  cheesy.  Oh, really?  Because it's so simple and so perfect that when you kind of try to overdo it, yeah, when  you overdo it, you go, why are they ruining something that's perfect?  So we kind of left it the same, and then we tried to do other new cues that had the 
[01:17:30]  same vibe.  Did you do any cameos?  Did you get any Jamie Lee Curtis face in there or anything?  No, no.  Playing the teacher or something?  I love when they do that.  I didn't want to do that.  Good.  I hate that.  It breaks the reality.  You're watching the movie, then you go, oh, why did they?  I watched the awful movie that I thought was awful, the remake of Lost in Space, which  was just horrible.  And they had a cameo of everyone that was still alive from Lost in Space, and it does. 
[01:18:00]  It just takes you right out of it.  You're like, oh, there she is.  There's the mother, and there's Adam Ward.  They had to throw her a bone.  Yeah.  Major West.  Look, he's playing some guy that isn't Major West.  He's playing an old guy.  I'm just imagining his version of Halloween, a lot of hot chicks, right?  Well, yeah, of course.  A lot of busty, busty, hot teenage girls.  Bodacious, busty broads.  It's hard to find normal girls to be in a movie.  Yeah.  It is. 
[01:18:30]  I always liked the regular, normal, like, girl-next-door chicks in those movies were  always better than the busty blonde.  Oh, yeah.  No, I tried to find people that looked normal, because you watch that, and you're like, oh,  it's Haddonfield, Illinois, and here's the schoolgirls.  Yeah.  They're all out of Hollywood.  They have a lot of plastic surgery in Illinois.  How violent is it?  Because you seem to like gore.  It's not that gory, but it's pretty violent.  More than the original?  Yeah.  But, I mean, the original is pretty tame when you watch it now.  Gore doesn't get people these days as much as this weird kind of suspense, jump out at 
[01:19:00]  you, crap.  Like, things that scared me, I'll tell you what petrified me was The Ring.  Either the original Japanese version or even the remake, American version.  That kind of crap that, like, just comes out at you, or that old-time black-and-white  weird movement.  Yeah, I mean, gore is not scary.  No.  And if it's too much, it's laughable.  Yeah, people start laughing.  Yeah.  No, I kept that to a minimum, and I just kind of want it to be real. 
[01:19:30]  So it's just the actors selling the scares and the suspense.  Yeah.  Also, you don't want to see the monster too much.  When you start seeing the monster too much in a movie, it takes you out.  You want to be surprised when he's just jumping out of nowhere.  That was the best part about Halloween, though.  You'd see him walk by a window.  Real fast.  And then you wouldn't see him for two minutes.  Yeah.  And you forgot that he walked by a window.  She didn't see him.  And then all of a sudden, he's right behind her with that mask.  Oh, my God.  And he never ran, but he caught everybody.  It was like, Michael Myers is the slowest walker ever.  And all of a sudden, she's running, and then five minutes later, he's right there with 
[01:20:00]  that stupid, tilted head.  He was horrified.  He knows all the shortcuts.  Yeah, that's it.  He's a speed walker.  That creepy outfit.  Yeah.  What scariest film you've ever seen, would you have to say?  The scariest film?  I always thought Jaws was the scariest movie ever.  That was the only time I ever remember being scared.  But I was also in third grade, so.  Yeah, it's just getting scary.  My girlfriend saw that recently with me.  She'd never seen it.  And then she's like, no, it was good, but it wasn't scary.  Nobody ever thinks anything's scary.  It's annoying.  I'll fess up to being petrified at a lot of movies. 
[01:20:30]  I can't even take ads on TV.  It's late at night.  It's dark.  I'm, like, thumbing through the channels.  And then that stupid, like, the grudge ad came on.  Yeah.  And I was like, goddamn little kids.  And those two girls in The Shining, every time.  I cannot look at them way down the hall.  That Kubrick shot of them way down the hall.  Come play with us, Danny.  Whoa.  I can't look.  The first half of The Shining is just scary, as all happens.  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  Well, so is the second half.  Well, I thought the second half is more funny.  Grady and him in that bathroom scene is a scream.  Your son is attempting to bring an outside party into this situation.  I thought the first half was really scary because of the whole transformation of his character.  And then he was what he was for the second half, like a complete lunatic.  But watching him losing his mind in the middle of this hotel.  I saw it recently.  And the way Grady changes in that bathroom, of course, it starts out with, 
[01:21:30]  Oh, let me get that hole from you, sir.  And then when he's like, you know, you chopped up your wife and kids.  And then Grady knows the jig's up.  It's like over.  And then he just gets this attitude like, you know, you know what you have to do.  Perhaps a bit more.  Needs a talking to.  I like a talking to or perhaps a bit more.  Either have a chat or chop him into pieces.  And the beautiful thing is that Nicholson catches him.  He goes, no, no, no.  You chopped your wife and daughter up.  And then you blew your brains out. 
[01:22:00]  Like, aha.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Like Grady's going to go, you're right.  I did commit suicide.  Let me get the avocado off the jacket.  Thanks for mentioning it.  That was one of the classics.  Hey, we should change gears slightly here.  You know how we were talking about Ozzy with Jimmy Norton?  Yeah.  Like he's an uber fan of Ozzy.  Yep.  We have an uber fan of Rob Zombie in this room right now.  And you met him.  Oh, yeah.  It's the same thing that you were saying about Jimmy.  It's not even a joke.  But you don't have an Ozzy tattoo, do you?  No.  This guy has been freaking out about this. 
[01:22:30]  This is Sam.  Our own.  Hello.  Yes.  And think how he was panicking because my girlfriend had a gallbladder surgery last night.  So I was calling up everybody going, look, I might not make it into the show.  And when I don't make it into the show, we usually don't do the show because it's kind  of awkward and stuff.  So this show was almost going to be canceled and his little heart was going to break if  he didn't get to meet you or see you here today.  We met before. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  We met at Comic-Con.  And I remember.  Oh, look at that.  Unlike the Ozzy scenario.  Yeah.  I, yes.  Oh, Jimmy.  Hello, Jim.  Well, it doesn't get any.  Hello, Jim.  And then there's someone he knows named Jim behind you.  Not you.  And Sam's like, move, you're blocking Jim.  Yeah, Jim, get out of this blue, go out of the way.  In Sam's eyes, though, it doesn't get any bigger than you, Rob.  Yep.  It's true.  Right?  There's no one bigger in your mind.  What about Vince McMahon? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, Vince.  That's true.  Rob, zombie beats Vince McMahon.  Wow.  It's true.  I don't have a Vince McMahon tattoo.  Tattoo.  Today's the one day you don't have a zombie shirt on.  He wears zombie shirts every day.  I went through my whole closet.  Have we seen this?  You don't want to overdo it.  Have we seen this tattoo?  Let me see your tattoo.  I've never seen it.  Where is it?  He has to take his pants off.  Your arm?  Yeah.  That twig?  That's the...  You're hiding it behind the mics.  Look at that.  Do you know what that reminds me of?  When Bart Simpson got a tattoo.  Yeah.  And it was inappropriate because it was a child. 
[01:24:00]  What was Bart's tattoo?  It was something weird.  Yeah, it was something weird.  Mother, I think.  Was it mother?  Oh, it just said moth.  A moth.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, right.  Stop.  And that's...  Where'd you get the autograph to it?  Well, he did an autograph signing when he came out with Educated Horses in Times Square.  Yeah.  And I signed with a tattoo gun.  Now that's permanent.  Separates the real fans.  Oh, boy.  We're going to be here a while. 
[01:24:30]  It's been 10 hours and he's only on the second person.  Look how rosy his cheeks are right now.  Oh, yeah.  I had to drive home from Syracuse because that's when I was going to school.  Yeah.  Just for the one day.  Like, I drove home that morning so I could get there.  I had my girlfriend wait in line at the Virgin store with all the people for a, you know,  a bracelet.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Seriously.  He's never liked it.  Wow, I love seeing this.  And then so, you know, I finally decided at the last minute that I would just ask him 
[01:25:00]  to sign my arm.  And then we went to the concert, which is the Nokia Theater, right after it.  And so I had to take another day off school to go to the tattoo shop as soon as it opened  the next day and get it signed.  And you went, go right over this.  And by the way, Sam.  Don't you screw up.  Your hero doesn't eat like an eight-year-old.  Yeah.  You know, you should change your eating habits.  You know, someone that's into Rob Zombie like this, you'd think you'd eat a little more,  I don't know.  Cooler?  Cooler.  The guy eats like an eight-year-old. 
[01:25:30]  He eats like an eight-year-old child.  This guy eats just like an eight-year-old, like the aunt just said.  How is that?  I don't remember how an eight-year-old eats.  Well, watch.  We have no idea what he ate last night.  Sam, what did you have for dinner last night?  It was an Elio's last night.  Elio's pizza.  And some more celery.  Celery sticks.  Celery sticks.  And he eats like fish sticks and chicken fingers.  Yeah.  And she eats like finger food that you give a little kid.  Right, because the kid doesn't want to eat much. 
[01:26:00]  And then he washes it down with a big glass of milk every night.  Big glass of milk.  And for dessert, he'll have like gummy cola bottles.  They taste like cola.  Waxed.  But they're like gummy.  Yeah, waxed.  What was your dessert last night?  Drink whatever that was out of it.  We got more ice cream, so I got to have ice cream last night.  How sweet.  Any topping on there?  Sprinkles?  No, we still don't have any toppings in the house.  Oh, that's a shame.  We'll have to buy you something.  It's weird that you like Rob Zombie, like with Lionel Richie being your dad. 
[01:26:30]  It's just weird.  He does look like the head from the Hello video.  Do you want to ask Rob?  That clay head that the blind girl made.  Oh, God, yeah.  Didn't even look like him.  Looked like Neanderthal man.  Yeah, Jesus.  But the whole point was, even though she's blind, she knew exactly what he looked like.  Goddamn.  Well, the guys prepared questions.  The caveman from the Geico ads.  The guys prepared questions for Sam to ask Rob Zombie.  Ah, thank God.  Look at his rosy cheeks. 
[01:27:00]  You're getting to talk to your hero in an equal setting.  Look at Rob.  He's like, oh, this isn't going to be good for anyone.  This is crap now.  Believe me.  It's different than the average interview, though.  We try to do things differently.  I'm glad he's a realist and not working this up to something good.  Right, right.  This is going to be a lot of fun for everyone.  Rob, I want to apologize.  This is going to suck.  Rob's like, whatever.  Can you at least promote Halloween?  Halloween is coming out.  Go ahead, Sam.  These are questions.  How would you rate your remake of Halloween on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being really cool, 
[01:27:30]  10 being ridiculously awesome?  11.  Wow.  Why'd you skip the...  Oh, you already know the answer to the first one.  Yeah.  The first one was, do you remember me?  Do you remember my tattoo?  But all right.  We have established that.  Yeah.  It's weird.  What do you think about the current direction of Hard Rock?  Oh, God. 
[01:28:00]  It's coming back a little bit.  There was like a five-year period there.  I don't know.  A little shaky.  Dude.  It's still pretty shaky.  Oof.  Yeah.  You think?  My theory is that it all died with the grunge rock.  Do you think Brett Michael's new show is going to help?  The rock of love?  I don't know what it's going to help Flava Flav, I guess.  Yeah.  It's...  Help him get more grunge.  It's Flava Flav with a white guy.  I know.  He makes up with every chick on the show.  Just tongue kisses him off.  Rob, I happen to think Sam is getting to the bottom of a lot of things.  You're right. 
[01:28:30]  Let's get to the issues of Barrel.  Go ahead.  What do you look for in a friend?  Well, I look for someone who will stand outside a building in the rain waiting by the side  door.  Whether or not I'm there.  There you go.  There's a little clue for you.  So, what's next for Rob Zombie?  What a typical ass question. 
[01:29:00]  What's next?  I'm going to get the hell out of here as fast as possible.  Good choice.  Actually, ask him the next one.  Okay.  What did you have for dinner last night?  I had pizza.  Cool.  Wow.  We're on the same page.  Look at that.  But he went to a grown-up store for his pizza.  Pop some Elios in a toaster, three-year-old.  You like to make scary movies.  What scares Rob Zombie? 
[01:29:30]  Well, this is doing a pretty good job.  I want an honest answer.  That small desk that separates everyone.  Go to the last question.  So, let's get him out of here.  Okay.  He's a very busy man.  Would you have been as successful if your name was Rob Vampire?  And he goes, not mine. 
[01:30:00]  Not my question.  I want to still...  Sam is shaking.  I've never seen you nervous.  Sam, hold your hand out straight.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  You are a mess.  I tried to take a...  When I went to Comic-Con in the press room, I tried to take a picture with my iPhone.  But it's hardly...  You can't even tell because it's completely blurred.  We'll get a real picture hopefully for you.  Luckily, my girlfriend is there with a real camera. 
[01:30:30]  You're doing some kind of tapping thing with your leg, too, I'm noticing.  This is my one...  I told Stan, this is my one vulnerability.  This is...  It's his weakness.  He's holding on to the counter.  You are his kryptonite.  Walk out from there.  Is there...  Someone catching Mickey Falls.  Yeah.  Look at him.  He's so vulnerable.  He's so vulnerable right now.  And what happened?  Poor boy.  Did you get your picture today?  Yes, I did.  And what happened?  Well, yeah.  I asked him...  Look at him shaking. 
[01:31:00]  He's got to lean on something.  He's very uncomfortable.  Oh, is he uncomfortable?  This is great.  I asked him to be so kind to sign the other two pictures I had with him and then asked  him to sign the third one, at which point he asked if there was anything we were doing  in this picture that would make it different from the two pictures.  Good for you.  Good for you, Rob.  Jeez, what an ass.  Well, let's get the pictures.  We'll compare.  Yeah.  Where are they?  Is there anything you want to ask, Rob, that you really want to know?  Yeah, one last question because we have to take a break here.  Like your own. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, sure.  So, what creatively did you get to do differently as a solo artist that you didn't get to do  when you left White Zombie?  Oh, shut up.  As the lead singer of White Zombie.  Truthfully, I creatively sort of stayed the same.  I just didn't have to argue with everybody anymore.  Makes sense.  How did you get all that dust off of you?  You used to be very dusty.  A little mini vac.  Remember that time?  That was awesome.  Hey, this is Rob Zombie and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:32:00]  Opie and Anthony.  The virus.  Opie and Anthony.  It was awful.  Worthless.  They're the worst.  Just screaming every racial epithet you can think of.  An abomination.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  We got this chick, Melissa Pickett.  She can't hear us right now.  She's an eco-therapist.  We were turned on to her by watching bullshit.  I saw it. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, you saw it?  I saw this episode, yeah.  Oh, that's right.  You were in that day.  I'm sorry.  I actually, I know exactly who you're talking about.  So we're going to lead her on a little bit and, you know, say we're really into it.  Get into it.  And yeah, we saw I'm really into it.  And we're hoping for maybe a good Ramoni.  Possibly, yeah.  Maybe a little bit of an interrupting interviewer.  Or maybe some serious phone calls from the listeners.  All right.  Be smart, folks.  Game on.  Let's say hi to Melissa Pickett.  We'll get her on. 
[01:33:00]  You got her?  Yeah.  We really want to talk to Melissa.  Melissa, are you there?  I am.  Here I am.  Hey, Melissa Pickett.  Thanks for calling the Greg and Tony Show.  How are you?  I'm great.  Good.  We were turned on to you because we saw you on that bull, well, we can't say the word,  dookie.  No.  The bull-ass show that Penn and Teller do on Showtime.  Uh-huh.  And we were fascinated by what you offer.  And we felt they kind of gave you a bum rap comment. 
[01:33:30]  No, I don't feel that way.  Hmm.  Um, I actually did watch the show, in fact, just yesterday.  Yeah.  And, uh, found it humorous.  Yeah.  The subject matter, you know, the final, um, place that they came to in the show was they  couldn't dispute or affirm human impact on the planet.  Exactly.  That's what I noticed, too.  And, uh, I think they were making light of, uh, of the work that you're doing, which, um, 
[01:34:00]  I think is fantastic.  Helping people in such a way was, uh, a very noble thing.  I think it's, uh, very important, uh, uh, to, uh, have people, uh, get together and be  one with nature like that.  Well, you know, I first, uh, came to the work that I'm doing and the focus of this because  I had people coming in to see me and they were complaining of all different kinds of 
[01:34:30]  symptoms.  And as I began working with them to try to help them figure it out, uh, it became apparent  that root issue was their, their concern for, for nature, the environment.  And this was, this was actually affecting them physically.  It can affect them in many different ways.  That's, uh, that's quite amazing that, uh, just this, and is it a guilt thing? 
[01:35:00]  Eco guilt, I think you call it.  Eco guilt, is that a...  Well, where I see that show up is in people not knowing what to do.  And if they, if they are driving their vehicle, if they're, if they're feeling like they're not  doing enough, they do feel guilty.  When they throw away trash, plastics, uh, they do come, they do comment about, I feel  really guilty.  I feel bad.  I don't know what I can be doing.  And, and it's really important not to go to a place of helplessness.  It seems like the, uh, the carbon footprint people are leaving seems to be, uh, uh, how 
[01:35:30]  would you say it?  Um, detrimental.  Detrimental?  Yes.  Yes, that's a good word.  Um, to everything.  Right or wrong?  Certainly, uh, you know, my, the way that I look at it is I can't exactly say what my  impact to the planet is every day. 
[01:36:00]  Well, you're helping.  You're obviously helping.  You're, you're, you're, you're giving a hoot.  Yeah.  Well, I think that's what we all have to do in our own way, in whatever way that is.  Uh, and you know, the, the way that I look at it is I have to be having some impact in,  in the way I live.  How can we have so many people?  Can I, I, I, I, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  No, you, I, I, if you, no, you go.  How about you?  Because you were before. 
[01:36:30]  I'll go.  You want me to go?  I'll ask.  All right.  Go ahead.  No, you, you, you, you.  You're excited about the, well, you know, it's very, very, very.  We're jumping over each other.  So, Bob, why don't you, uh.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll go.  I'll go.  Yeah.  How are you doing?  This is Rich Voss.  How are you?  This is Melissa Pickett.  Hi, Melissa.  How are you?  I'm a big fan, first of all.  Saw the show and, uh, big fan.  I just wanted to get into, uh, the rocks.  I mean, you, you, you went on to the parking lot. 
[01:37:00]  You picked up rocks out of the, uh, out of Mother Earth.  I did.  I would say, right?  Uh-huh.  And you handed them to these people, and what, what does that do?  Like, can I just go to.  Have you ever tried it?  No, I mean, I live in Manhattan, so it'd be hard.  I'd have to dig up the sidewalk.  Oh, you don't have rocks there.  No.  Uh, well, think of it this way.  I'm living on one.  And envision how you feel when you go out into nature.  What is the effect of that?  Uh-huh.  You feel naturally slowed down.  Right.  Uh-huh.  You feel calm.  Uh-huh.  You aren't around a lot of hustle and bustle, so you have clear space. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  What do you mean by hustle and bustle?  Well, a lot of static around you.  It's a lot of people, a lot of airwaves, a lot of radio waves, you know, day-to-day life,  traffic, horns honking, sirens going, you know, what's the effect of all that on the nervous  system?  Do you pick...  You know what I've noticed?  Yeah.  The world's gone and gotten itself in a big damn hurry.  We are in a big hurry.  That's part of the problem. 
[01:38:00]  We're going so fast, we're not paying attention.  Yeah.  Melissa, do you...  So what does a rock in your pocket do?  The rock in the pocket is to help you remember that there is something that you are connected  to that you've forgotten.  So you feel it kind of, it kind of, uh, when you're living with the daily grind, as we like  to say, the rock in the pocket centers you a little bit?  It centers you.  It grounds you.  I wasn't finished, but you go right ahead.  You just, go ahead.  I didn't mean I wasn't finished, but go ahead.  Oh, go ahead. 
[01:38:30]  Do you feel that it's, um, it grounds you and will help refocus you?  Or is it something that's going to kind of distract you because your, your mind will  be elsewhere?  My experience is...  All right.  Sorry about that.  Go right ahead.  It's centering.  No, no.  It's all about you.  I didn't mean to actually talk on the radio show a part of.  Go ahead.  What were you saying?  Centering.  We'll finish this one.  You were, uh, it's centering in what way?  Uh, I feel better.  Really?  That's the best way to say it.  I just feel better. 
[01:39:00]  Any, any time, you know, if you have, why do people like to put flowers in their offices?  Yeah, yeah.  We all know about that.  But let's get back to what you were doing with the rocks.  Do you feel, because a lot of people say that the rocks are a distraction.  I've heard that argument made.  Yeah, yeah.  You say they're centering, and I've heard other people say they're a distraction, and they remove  your focus, because they, they, they put your mind in a place where you're not focused  on the task at hand.  Um, you know, I've heard that.  Well, I mean. 
[01:39:30]  All right, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Whatever you want to say, you go right ahead.  Maybe we should just give you the mic.  Okay.  It's kind of, in a way, just a.  Yeah, I'm sure it is.  It's a really theoretical discussion, because the truth is in the pudding, and, uh.  What does George Harrison's head have to do with any of this?  Yeah, we, we don't understand that whole truth is in the pudding thing.  What does that really mean?  It's the proof.  The proof is in the pudding.  It's an old saying.  But what does that really mean, though?  The truth is in the pudding.  The proof, yeah.  It's in the experience. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, okay.  Sure, sure.  But, but, but you.  Excuse me.  If someone.  Whoa.  Wants to.  Mm-hmm.  Take a charge.  If someone wants to find a way.  Don't get on her bad side.  Who have the best, most functional, fulfilling life, and they are concerned with their well-being  and how they can make it.  We got, we got, we got, I, I get what you're saying.  We got to focus here.  You're rambling in circles.  Melissa Pickett.  Now, what is an M-A-L-P-C? 
[01:40:30]  What exactly does that stand for?  Yeah.  Uh, Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor.  Oh.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Now, what about the, um, the labyrinth?  This sounds very mysterious, almost frightening.  Well, there's a lot of information on the internet about the labyrinth, and I think people  can look that up for themselves.  I'd like to know about your labyrinth and what that, um, what that means, because when  I saw it, uh, it, labyrinths, uh, ooh, they scare me a little bit.  Well, try it out. 
[01:41:00]  See what, see what you see.  Are yours made out of hedges?  No, there are some.  Or in a cornfield?  They're stones.  Do you remember that scene in The Shining?  I mean, it was so scary.  Oh, my goodness, right?  There was the, uh...  A little, uh...  They had choices.  You know, I, I, I want to go back.  I know you said I was ready to go.  Sure, go ahead.  You run the interview.  Oh, no, no, no, no, go ahead.  We're just guests on your show.  Because I don't think the question is, is answered.  No, no, no, well, go ahead.  Whatever you think there, uh, Ted Koppel.  Take us wherever you want.  We're just, we're just actors in your play. 
[01:41:30]  The, um, for, for people who are looking for a way to have a healthy, happy,  healthy life.  Sure, well, that's part of the game.  Go ahead.  Whatever, whatever way they can find to make connection with, with some deeper part of  themselves is what I encourage.  Right.  Okay.  Should we go back anymore?  What else did we do wrong?  Apparently we're not, uh, asking questions.  Your satisfaction.  Go right ahead.  It's all about you, you.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Welcome to the Melissa Pickett Show.  Go.  I think Melissa's making some, uh, fine, valid points here.  This is because I, I've noticed, Melissa, I've noticed I feel terrible, uh, when I use 
[01:42:00]  certain things that I know are going to be in a landfill for a long time.  Uh, these are, these things affect me.  What can I do to make myself feel better about this?  Pay attention to how you live and do, do the little things.  Melissa, I'm feeling ego guilt.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, this is, uh, this is, uh, Ted, Melissa.  He's, uh, uh, please bear with us.  He's a bit slow.  I try to be environmentally conscious and yet I find myself leaving a bigger carbon footprint 
[01:42:30]  than I intended on leaving.  We feel like all voices should be heard on our show.  So Ted's a bit slow, but, uh, his point is, uh, just as important.  So, uh, please listen to Ted.  Melissa!  What can I do to help lighten my carbon footprint?  That will be your turn to answer the question.  Because I tend, I tend to do things like, when flowers are blooming, I'll pour gasoline  on them. 
[01:43:00]  Well, that's not very eco-friendly.  No, that's not, Ted.  Melissa!  Melissa?  Yeah?  You're not answering my questions.  I need help.  What could you, uh, tell, uh, Ted today?  Ted's, yeah, Ted's a little, you know.  Melissa?  Melissa?  I'd say, uh, Ted's a little stressed out.  Yeah, a little bit.  All right, let's go to our phone calls.  They've been, uh, wanting to, uh, talk to you all morning here.  Uh, let's start with Bob in Connecticut. 
[01:43:30]  Bob, you're on with Melissa Pickett.  She's a eco-therapist.  Hi, good morning.  Uh, Greg and Tony love the show.  Long time listener.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Thank you, Bob.  Thank you.  Miss Pickett, Mrs. Pickett, I'm sorry, excuse me, I'm not familiar with your work, I'm not  sure if you're married or not, but I have this tremendous eco-guilt any time I use the  bathroom to the point that I've forced myself to contain my bowel movement for the last two  weeks, and it's becoming extremely uncomfortable, and all I can do all day is daydream about taking 
[01:44:00]  a giant steaming shit.  Booyah!  Booyah!  Wow.  Um, booyah.  Uh, Melissa?  Mm-hmm.  We're going to have to beep that.  Yeah, we're, yeah, they beeped it down the hall, but, uh, he makes a very good point,  because, uh, you know, when you're, when you're doing that, how do we explain it on the radio?  When you're, when you wake up in the morning and you do that, uh, isn't that, uh, uh, wrecking  the environment, in a way?  Um, the, um, the concern that people might have with that is the use of water. 
[01:44:30]  For example, we live in a drought area here, and we had people who were very concerned,  literally, with their toilet flushes.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  They were concerned about conservation of the water and not having it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, uh, you know, that became a concern for people in New Orleans. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, of course.  That became a concern for people in Atlanta.  But they had plenty of water in New Orleans.  It's, it, it's not drinkable.  Oh.  Oh.  So, you know, that's...  I got confused, because you were talking about a drought.  Water is a, uh, the nectar of life.  We don't have water, we can't exist.  Oh, I like that.  Nectar of life.  Wait a minute.  If you don't have water, you can't exist.  No, not at all.  Wow.  Are you suggesting we raise a generation of, uh, super kids?  I'm suggesting we raise a generation of conscious kids. 
[01:45:30]  Mm, sure.  And should we give kids rocks?  Like, if you give a, should you give your kids rocks, or is that, would that be for,  like, adults, or is that a certain age, or can that help kids, too?  I suggest we take kids out into our parks.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  We take kids camping.  Mm-hmm.  We give them experiences with kids, and we get them off the TVs and the computers.  Where did Jimmy go?  Uh, Melissa, did, uh, we got a soldier that came back from Iraq, and, uh, this, I, I, I've 
[01:46:00]  been following the Green Movement, and this is, uh, this has come up a few times.  Uh, Rich in Colorado, what do you have for Melissa Pickett, the ecotherapist?  Hi, Melissa.  I'm a huge fan of yours.  I saw your show, uh, well, I saw you on Penn & Teller, and, uh, I saw your little labyrinth,  the rock garden, and it reminded me of when I was in Baghdad for 15 months, and I was walking  around in circles there, kind of being, doing useful stuff.  But the question I have is, I was driving, you know, those big, huge Humvees around, which  put all the carbon footprint stuff. 
[01:46:30]  And I was wondering, how much of a carbon footprint do IEDs leave?  Hmm.  I have no idea.  I'm not an environmentalist, so you'd have to go on the website, figure that out for yourself.  But you would imagine, Melissa, there would be a lot of...  Well, I saw IEDs, there's a lot of smoke and stuff, and a lot of parts from trucks flying  around.  I was just wondering, like, what would you guess, like, ballpark figure?  What are we talking?  I have no idea, because I'm not an expert in that area.  All right.  But, uh, the point, uh, being, Melissa, that, that, that, I'm sure that would, uh, bring  on a lot of guilt. 
[01:47:00]  If you're one of these soldiers that, uh, is fighting the, the good fight over in Iraq  and Afghanistan.  Yeah, I probably would.  Yeah, I would, I would hope that we would all just send a, uh, good, good words and a  blessing of support.  Sure.  For being over there.  Oh, sure.  And let's support him how we can.  We're running out of time, uh, because we've got to take a break for the, uh, the NPR news.  But first, we've got Steve from, uh, where is he from?  A yellow, something yellow.  I'm not, I can't read the last.  Yellow, yellow, yellow star.  Hello? 
[01:47:30]  Yes, you're on with Melissa Pickett, Steve.  I, I have a, a, a, a bad connection.  I, may I speak with Ms. Pickett?  Uh, you're on the line with, uh, Ms. Pickett.  Oh, hello?  Melissa?  Hello, I'm here.  I, I, I think that a lot of people don't seem to take the, uh, environment seriously.  And I don't think that they understand that their impact, like, people don't feel as individuals,  like, because I personally had my stomach stapled.  And yet I didn't change the problems inside that made me do that to begin with.  Um, and I find that, uh, what's really been happening is people don't seem to understand the impact we have on the earth. 
[01:48:00]  That, that one person can make a difference.  I hope that we all are all making up to begin to understand that.  What's that?  I'm sorry.  I said I hope, I hope that you're doing your part to help people understand that.  Well, I find that, it might sound crazy, but I'm not drinking really bottled water anymore.  I'm drinking tap water because I don't want to continually use all the bottles and the plastic,  which I don't believe are recycled properly. 
[01:48:30]  That's probably true.  Could you elaborate on what else I could do?  Because I'm, I'm feeling like I, I just don't know, but I really do want to contribute and participate accurately.  I'm really worried about this one, though, because, again, it always hurts my throat, and yet it plays funny on the air.  So what do you think I could be doing differently?  Add to what you're doing.  Ramone!  Someone leave a carbon ball print on this bitch's nose bridge! 
[01:49:00]  Ramone!  Melissa carries rocks under her clit hood!  Ramone!  Melissa should be chased through a labyrinth by a bleeding AIDS patient!  I really, uh...  Ramone!  You can't go do this for pedophiles!  I hope that people who are listening will allow, in whatever way that they can, to know that they can make a difference. 
[01:49:30]  Ramone!  Melissa pitches each dirty asshole!  Are you finished?  Yes, that's all I wanted to say.  But I really do want to know what you think I might be doing better to help the environment.  Oh, my goodness.  You know, it never fails.  The caller gets through, and, uh...  She didn't answer my question.  We couldn't, uh...  We couldn't cut it off quickly enough.  Hello?  I'm so sorry, Melissa, that, uh... 
[01:50:00]  Hello?  Sometimes these callers get through, and they just want to make jokes.  We have no need to apologize.  Let's just, let's allow that anyone listening to this show, in their heart of hearts, make their own decision about what's happening out there, how it's affecting them, and let them know that...  Goddamn rich cunt!  We're all human, and we're all sharing in the world together.  Goddamn rich cunt! 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  I hear ya.  It makes good sense.  It sure does, uh, Melissa.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  You all right?  Okay.  It wasn't trippy.  Any other questions?  Still there?  Any other callers?  Yeah, we have, uh, plenty of, uh, calls coming in.  Why don't we, uh, this is a very good question coming in from Steve in, uh, Union, New Jersey.  Steve.  Hi, Melissa.  How are you doing today?  Good.  How are you? 
[01:51:00]  I'm excellent.  I, uh, I, uh, I realize my ideas might not be 100% orthodox, but, um, I was really wondering what you thought about, um, marijuana.  See, I believe that that comes from nature, and it's very difficult for me to be centered when I'm not really big.  Mm-hmm.  So what's your question?  Comment?  My question is, uh, how, how do you think that helps the ego footprint?  Because, I mean, I'm planting a lot of trees here in New Jersey, and, uh, you know, it's helping people get centered in their lives. 
[01:51:30]  I was just wondering what you think about that.  She said she's not an expert on that.  Are you, are you, are you feeling, uh, a bit of guilt because you're smoking the weed, Steve?  Oh, not at all.  Not at all.  Uh, Melissa, can I ask you something?  Yeah.  Uh, of course, we're concentrating here on the United States, but, um, there, there seems to be a lot of, uh, uh, uh, I don't know, it's almost eco-crimes going on, uh, in other countries.  You understand what I mean? 
[01:52:00]  So it's kind of hard, uh, for us to do something knowing that, uh, other countries are just, uh, uh, screwing up by the numbers here.  You know?  I don't think it's just a United States problem, it's a world problem.  It is a world problem, and we got, uh, you know, to the south, we have, uh, uh, Mexico, uh, just pumping out, uh, uh, pollutants, and, uh, uh, to the north, we got just moronic, stupid-ass Canadians, uh, that just don't know, uh, anything about anything, to tell you the truth. 
[01:52:30]  That brings a lot of stress and guilt.  Yes, a lot of guilt.  Yeah.  I mean, they're like our retarded neighbors to the north that have to be cared for and cuddled, uh, as they ruin the planet.  Sure.  Uh, we got Uncle Paul, uh, checking in.  Uncle Paul, you're on with Melissa Pickett, the, uh, eco-therapist.  Uh, hello, this is Paul.  Hello.  How are you?  Well, you know, I, I teach, uh, children, and, uh, what is it, it seems it's very hard to get an eco-responsible message through to younger people, because it all starts at home with the interfering parents. 
[01:53:00]  That's true.  And what is the best way, do you think, to try to get that message to children?  Because I deal with the, uh, very young kids, and it's, it's very hard, because they don't understand consequences or what tattling can do to somebody.  So, exactly what is it?  How do you make that fun for children? 
[01:53:30]  Uh, meet children where they are.  I'm not sure what you mean, although that sounds...  Playing outside, letting them draw, talking about what they like in nature, letting them grow.  Ribbon!  Melissa should pick up rocks from her driveway with her cunt lips!  Ribbon!  Somebody fuck this four-eyed bitch in the back of an SUV with the air conditioning going full blast! 
[01:54:00]  Ribbon!  This four-eyed nerd should be sodomized with a giant sunflower!  You know, I want to go back to the kids.  Ribbon!  Oh, my God!  Melissa should carry bottles of water in her pussy!  Who is letting this color get through?  I don't know how it is.  This is outrageous.  Our screener really needs to...  I want to go back to the comment about, uh, the Canadians and...  Yeah, because it really seems very hard to get that message across, because they just, they keep telling. 
[01:54:30]  You tell them, this is going to get me in a lot of trouble.  You've got to keep your mouth closed, but they tell.  They always tell.  Part of the problem is we, we want to blame other people.  Ramon!  Ramon!  The Jews are responsible for bad weather!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, gentlemen, I've enjoyed our time together today.  Ramon!  And, uh...  And, uh... 
[01:55:00]  Melissa Pickett has thin, unkissable lips!  I, um, have to go out in the world now and...  Ramon!  Melissa has a hairdo, like Claire's cousin Jerry from The Facts of Life!  And so, I'm going to wish you well.  All right.  Ramon!  Somebody tell this dinosaur next, bitch, to shut up already!  To have a wonderful day.  I understand.  Yes.  And to do your parts.  Thank you.  Ramon!  Thank you. 
[01:55:30]  Recycling us, a faggot!  Thank you so much.  Help the world be a better place.  I agree.  I agree.  God bless you all.  Thank you so much, Melissa Pickett.  Mm-hmm.  Bye-bye.  There it goes.  I think that was a real cop-out.  Melissa Pickett?  Oh, this has got to be the funniest thing.  Oh, my God.  I don't think there's anything funnier.  When he just blurts out that fucking Ramon.  I don't think there's anything funnier.  On the fucking planet Earth, too.  I don't think there's anything fucking funnier.  What the fuck, Jimmy? 
[01:56:00]  Hey, this is Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and  Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  When you see a deer, you see Bambi, and I see antlers up on the wall.  When you see a lake, you think picnics, and I see a large mouth up on that log. 
[01:56:30]  You're probably thinking that you're gonna change me in some ways.  Well, maybe you might scrub me down, dress me up.  Oh, but no matter what, remember, I'm still a guy.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Bah!  We got some lady on the phone that says, this bitch won't stop phoning, is very annoyed  you haven't spoken to her yet. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, let's get to her.  We don't like to make people wait.  We apologize.  Who's this?  What's your name, dear?  Hello?  Hi.  How are you, dear?  Hi.  Who are you?  Maria.  Hi, Maria.  What's going on?  Hi, Maria.  What can we do for you today?  I heard you've been calling for the last hour or so.  Actually, it's been two hours.  Oh, my goodness.  What's the matter?  What can we do to help you?  All right.  Only one of you at a time, please.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I have everything to say.  Okay.  Okay.  Number one, Jimmy.  Yeah?  You're sexually confused. 
[01:57:30]  Why, Maria?  All you ever talk about is dicks and ass.  What's confusing about that?  You've just got a point.  Point taken.  Yeah.  Maybe that's all you ever want.  No, that's not true, Maria, because I don't know how to say this respectfully, but I do talk  about big tits and big fat...  Hold on.  That's true.  I didn't finish, dear.  That's true.  How about...  I do talk about big, fat, meaty cunts. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, my pal Jimmy's a slit man.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So now he wants dick, ass, and fat women.  I don't want fat women.  No, no, no.  I didn't say that.  Don't...  You're putting fucking...  You're putting words in my mouth.  And I could only in yours.  Well, now, you also said you had other things to address.  Let's...  Yes, sir.  Let's hear that, too.  What's next?  Tell him to shut up a second.  Oh.  Jimmy.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Jimmy, shut up.  Hold on.  Sorry.  Does this fat pig have a problem with me? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Do you have a problem with Jimmy?  Let's get this in the open here.  That's why I want to know if the other one's concerning you, too.  Jimmy, we love you.  I have to tape everything that's ever on air that you're on.  All right.  Oh.  Does the fact that you have a drinking problem make that difficult?  God, I wish I did.  Okay.  Then I would be happy.  What's number two?  What's number two?  What's number two?  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Number two is, you guys were doing the thing about Obama and McCain this morning?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there's a thing on, if you go under secretpants.net, that they took 30 quotes from 
[01:59:00]  all the Batman shows from the 60s, and 30 quotes from President Bush.  This is old already.  And ask people, who said this quote?  Right.  Batman or Bush, we know.  I like the way she explains it.  She does it slow.  Number three.  Deliberate, yes.  Yeah, I like the way she can nap.  Number three.  Number three. 
[01:59:30]  Is for my husband, Arthur, to get my exit video fixed for my car.  What's the matter with your exit video in your car?  Don't you hate Arthur's wife?  Ha ha!  You fucking guy.  He drives truck.  He's in a shitload.  Bitterman.  No.  Run over my wife, Bitterman, please.  This moose must have really pissed you off.  All right.  She's such a fucking pig.  I'd rather fuck Lars and Minnelli.  Hopefully you'll wind up like Dudley, too. 
[02:00:00]  Like you're all Arthur.  Club-footed and pudding-headed.  With a hat full of mashed potatoes.  A fucking top hat full of fucking mashed potatoes.  Jimmy, you like those, too, huh?  Yes.  I'm gay and I...  No.  You like potatoes?  It's mine, and I don't have mine yet.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you...  Nice, right?  Slowly.  Do you ever suck a guy's cock?  She's answering.  Tell him slowly.  Do you put mustard on it and pretend it's a big hot dog? 
[02:00:30]  Show me with your mouth.  That's what I'm saying.  Show me with your mouth.  He's...  What?  He is...  obsessed with cocks and asses.  Shut your goddamn pie hole!  Ooh.  Can't she talk?  I did not make a new friend, did I?  Can't she talk for a floor?  Did she say the third one?  I don't remember if she said the third one.  Oh, come on.  Come lighten up.  What's the third one?  Yeah, she needs her XM unit fixed.  Oh.  Bobby.  What's the matter?  She stuck around for two hours for this.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:01:00]  You are, perhaps, the most boring fucking caller we've ever had.  Mm-hmm.  Do you understand what...  Yeah, and it's not just me saying that.  Everybody on PalTalk Instant Feedback, everything else, is just bashing you as a waste of time,  boring cunt who just fucking...  Well, I'm just reading.  I'm paraphrasing.  Jesus, Anthony.  But that's what the people are saying.  The people have spoken.  I find her endearing.  The people have spoken.  I don't.  And why?  What? 
[02:01:30]  Why am I boring?  Why would they...  Because you're boring, everybody.  You're not...  What you're saying isn't interesting.  The tone you're saying, the cadence you're speaking in, everything about you, the way you  talk is fucking boring.  You're fucking boring.  When you talk, I see a little cartoon bubble by the head.  There's a bunch of Z's in it.  Z.  Z.  Z.  And it's not even in a talk bubble.  It's a little cloudy think bubble.  Yeah, that's how it is.  Really?  You're boring.  Do you bore Arthur, your husband?  We're going to have to go home early because of you. 
[02:02:00]  Because now you need to sleep.  When was the last time Arthur gave you a little stickin' of some dickin'?  That's right.  Comment?  When duty comes out.  Come on, please.  I think she's good at parties, though, like her other friends.  She probably holds court when her girlfriends come over.  Oh, I bet.  But she's just the talk of the town.  Why don't you answer the questions that wouldn't be as boring?  When was the last time your husband Arthur gave you some dick?  Where the duty comes out.  Oh, last night.  Last night?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  How long have you been married? 
[02:02:30]  Thirteen years.  Oh, yeah.  How many kids you got?  Two?  One.  One.  One kid.  Why don't you like me?  One.  That's handicapped.  Oh, oh.  What's wrong?  Here's the problem.  Can we guess?  No, no, guys.  Guys, stop.  Seriously.  No.  It's very serious.  Can we play 20 afflictions?  Yeah, can we guess?  Can we guess what kind of...  Can we try to guess?  What's wrong?  Sure, go for it.  We'll do 20 questions.  All right, let's get...  Yes or no questions.  Okay?  Yes. 
[02:03:00]  Is it mental?  What do you mean by mental?  It's a yes or no question.  Is it a mental handicap?  Okay, yes.  All right.  Does your kid look like a lot of other kids?  No.  No.  What was your favorite beverage during pregnancy?  Ice-T.  Okay.  Ice-T.  Okay.  All right.  Does it affect your kid's ability to...  No, it was not Long Island.  Okay.  Hold on.  We've got a question.  Does it affect his ability to play ping pong? 
[02:03:30]  Good question.  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  How old is the kid?  I'm actually fun.  I really thought I'd hate you.  How old is the kid?  She's 11.  Oh, she.  Okay, so she's 11.  Can I...  I got a question.  Okay, ask the question.  No, go ahead.  Is your daughter still wearing the same pair of shoes for the last 11 years?  No.  No.  But for the first 12 months, yes. 
[02:04:00]  Do you...  Do you sometimes wish you had fallen down the stairs?  No.  Okay.  Bob, you had a question?  Yeah, I was just...  Does your daughter eat like a horse?  And he means grass in the front yard.  What?  What about the front yard?  For her birthday party, do you put a candle in a pile of lead paint chips?  No, but that's a really good idea.  All right. 
[02:04:30]  So it's mental, mental handicap, IQ of 70 or below.  No, say what?  Actually, we don't know.  Okay, so...  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You want the prize now?  No, no, no, no.  No, we're guessing.  When you guys are taking family photos, is she all the way at the end so you can crop her  around?  No, but that's sad.  That is sad.  That's oldie. 
[02:05:00]  Let's put it this way.  Let me ask you a question.  Let me just ask you a question.  Does she have a really long tongue?  No.  Okay, what do you want to say, Marie?  Give us a hint.  Okay, here's a hint.  It's the opposite of ups syndrome.  Does it rhyme with schnortism?  Okay, I got one for you.  All right.  Okay.  Technically, she's undiagnosed.  Oh. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, we have a question from a listener.  Is her spine shaped like the Superman logo?  No, I wish.  No, I wish it was.  I know what she's got.  Yeah.  I know what she's got.  Daughter of retard-itis.  Oh, Jimmy, that runs in your family.  Oh.  Jimmy.  She got me good.  Someone quick, pop out their cock.  Rubber, you're glue.  First the potatoes, dig, then this. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, no.  I know.  Damn.  All right.  What stupid thing is wrong with your daughter?  What is it?  Hold on, hold on.  That's stupid.  What is it?  More questions.  No, we really want to know the answer now.  What's wrong with your...  On visual inspection, just looking, can you tell that there's a mental handicap?  No.  No?  Does it...  No.  Does it look like she's wearing a broom for hair?  Why would she be... 
[02:06:30]  I wish.  Does her bangs just go straight across the front?  Oh, wait.  I, I, I...  No, I wish.  Undiagnosed.  Undiagnosed.  What is that?  Then she's fine.  All right.  What's wrong with her?  Like, what can you tell us?  Okay, well, first off, um, my daughter's 11.  She's getting four times to locks of love.  Do you know what that is?  Yeah.  Yes.  Hair.  What?  That's where they cut the hair off and send it to little cancer kids.  Which is 47 inches.  My daughter's 54 inches tall.  I'm saying that she's very, uh, that's very sweet.  But what does she have? 
[02:07:00]  Okay, um, um, cerebral palsy is a dump all.  A what?  For what they don't know what a kid has.  Oh, so they just say CP.  You got it.  That's not funny.  Yeah.  That's not funny.  And flush Jimmy with it.  That's not funny.  That's not funny.  What were you saying about me? 
[02:07:30]  You threw me into the mix again.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  What's the matter?  You don't like me.  I'm trying not to laugh really, really effing hard right now.  Really?  How come you don't like me?  Oh, yeah.  How come you don't like me?  Jimmy, I have not liked you since I saw you on everything on TV and heard you.  Why?  But she's obsessed with you.  Yeah, you know, why don't you like me?  Let's be honest.  This broad has called before, by the way.  Yeah, I know.  She's, are you fat?  And then there's no shame in it.  What have I called before? 
[02:08:00]  What's that?  It doesn't matter if you have it or not.  It's irrelevant.  Are you fat or no?  Because I, I, I beg on fat women and they take me wrong sometimes.  God, I wish I was.  You keep saying that.  5'9", 5'9", 150 pounds.  Would you, uh, so what's the problem with me?  Why don't you like me?  5'9", 150.  That's a lot.  You're a big girl.  You're a big girl.  Yeah, I am.  Jesus Christ.  I can palm a basketball.  Thank you very much.  Hang on.  Good.  What?  What?  Your kid's head?  God, I wish.  I wish I had that.  You keep saying that.  Stop saying God, I wish. 
[02:08:30]  That's a crutch.  She's an excellent improper.  Yes.  Always go with it.  Wonderful.  Keep saying the same thing.  Look up that website, secretpants.com.  No, we saw that website.  It sucks almost as badly as your call.  So why don't you quit beating around the fucking, beating around the Mo Howard haircut?  Hey, did you guys ever notice that when he gets offensive, he gets belligerent?  Why don't you tell me, they're both the same thing, you dumb twat.  Yeah.  Why don't you tell me what it is you don't like about me and stop fucking boring everyone?  I gotta go. 
[02:09:00]  Wow.  Wow.  That was a sonogram picture reaction.  I'm sorry.  It's true.  What is true?  When you get pissed off, you get belligerent.  Yeah, so what?  That's not a thin on point.  You really have to go, Bobby?  Yeah, I gotta dent this.  I really...  Hey, I was supposed to go around 10 minutes ago.  I wanted to...  They got a clean cum out of your teeth?  See, another dick reference.  Yeah, see?  Yeah, see, Bob's going to the dentist to have them strengthened.  Anthony, dear. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah?  I really want to stay for what's about to happen.  If you could please call my husband to get my XM for my dentist.  Hold on.  Not until you explain why you don't like me.  You have to explain why you don't like me.  Because Bob is going to have little hairs put on his teeth to make it easier to eat in the ocean.  I'd rather keep Anthony in suspense.  No, it's not going to happen.  I'm asking you.  No one cares.  Anthony, I can't be kept in suspense.  I'm the only one who has interest in you right now.  I have to get my teeth fixed, Jimmy, because I'll mush my food on my palate.  Why don't you keep him in suspense?  Oh, as soon as this show ends, Anthony's not even going to remember you called.  Yes. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  You're very forgettable.  Oh, that's cool, because that's fine with me, because guess what?  So are you.  Then why do you keep calling, you silly pig?  Stop calling.  I wasn't calling to talk to you.  Yes, you were.  There was nothing you'd love more than me to park my fucking caddy and me to let you take my dick down to the root.  Who was kidding?  That's exactly what you want.  I'm sorry.  I'm not a man.  No, you sound like a man.  You're a fucking woman, and you need to be fucking fucked properly.  Your husband's on the road, probably blowing guys through glory holes. 
[02:10:30]  Jesus, Jimmy.  That's what Arthur's doing.  Just don't come in that busted baby maker of hers.  I don't know what'll come out.  That fucking womb.  It's like the house from Lost.  Why?  He gets so belligerent when he gets...  You said that already.  I agree with you 100%.  Maria, you just languish in redundancy.  Say something different.  Jimmy.  Yes?  Quit talking about dicks and asses. 
[02:11:00]  You said that already.  Yes.  Keep it going.  You're doing wonderfully.  I love this girl's improv.  You say the same thing over and over.  You make no real points.  No wonder your husband hates your guts.  Jim, so are you.  Your husband hates you.  What's the point?  You're calling me.  I don't care about you.  I didn't call you.  Yes, you did.  I called Opie and Anthony.  I'm right here, baby.  He's part of the show.  It's Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  We just don't have enough room on the cardboard.  I didn't say I'm calling Jimmy Norton personally.  Doesn't matter.  The phone screener hated you. 
[02:11:30]  He said this pig keeps calling.  You're a fucking attention whore.  You need to connect somehow.  You need that connection.  I don't like being put on ignore for over and over.  Why?  You're ignorable.  You're a non-entity.  You're on ignore your whole life with people.  I think you're a Munchhausen syndrome by proxy woman.  What do you mean by that?  I think that she keeps her daughter ill to get attention.  Oh, yeah.  She's probably right.  One of those kind.  You fucking six-cent soup maker.  Do you do that?  You're a six-cent soup maker.  Right.  You put a little Drano in the kid's soup.  What are you doing over there?  What are you doing? 
[02:12:00]  Shooting feces into her arm to keep her sick?  Actually, I don't think that's funny.  She's probably totally...  You know why?  Because probably it's close to home.  She's probably totally fine.  No, because I just took her to the doctor yesterday.  Because you seem like an attention whore.  Yeah.  And attention whores have this Munchhausen syndrome by proxy.  Have the doctors discussed that with you?  My problem is...  Undiagnosed?  That's fucking weird.  Yep.  And boy, maybe somebody better look into what you're doing. 
[02:12:30]  What does your doctor...  What does the doctor say?  How often do you see the doctor?  A lot, I bet, right?  You help out with the diagnosis and everything.  And you know the nurses by name when you come in.  Yeah, your friends are like, how's it going?  Yeah, yeah.  And you're like, well, you know, it's a struggle every day.  Let me get some more fucking Windex for her Hawaiian punch.  Then you just gotta call and get on the radio.  And they keep hanging up on you.  And you just gotta fucking...  You just gotta keep calling.  You gotta fucking be heard, don't you? 
[02:13:00]  Everyone is pointing out, by the way, Joe from Jersey.  What kind of mother calls up and plays?  Guess what's wrong with my retard kid?  That's true.  Oh, are you a horrible mother?  Yeah, how much attention do you need?  Right from that infected womb up until 11 years later.  She actually decided to play Guess What's Wrong With My Retarded Kid.  You just sell your kid down the river for 30 seconds to try to connect with me.  Because you fucking...  You got something for me.  We both know it.  You try insulting me because you're a little girl in the schoolyard.  But listen, we both know what you'd like.  You'd like me to kind of pull your hair and face fuck you. 
[02:13:30]  Is that the kid in the background?  I was calling about the thing earlier.  What thing?  Was she conceived during a keg stand?  Secretpans.net.  Stop with this corny website.  We'd like me to lay you on the bed.  You want me to lower your head off the bed so the blood rushes to your head and then  throat fuck you with my onion balls on your nose until your eyes tear up.  That's what you want.  Oh, that's...  You want to make that noise.  And now, which means now, besides being into guys, he is unbazed. 
[02:14:00]  On what?  Because if he says he has onion balls...  No.  No.  That was kind of the joke.  I was saying that I have such little regard for you as a fucking...  As a living entity that I wouldn't even shower.  I'd put my onion balls on your fucking desperate nose.  I'd say, look, I'll acknowledge you.  And you'd go, uh-huh.  And you'd say, okay.  Because you sold your own kid down the river.  You fucking called repeatedly.  How did I sell my kid down the river?  Exactly.  The same fucking playing guess what's wrong with my kid. 
[02:14:30]  You're fucking...  You're awful.  You're awful.  You're an attention whore.  You are an attention whore.  You got to admit.  How...  Question.  How did I sell my kid...  I explained that to you.  I stopped talking and listened.  It was just explained to you.  I just explained to you what you did.  You asked...  Shut up.  Go ahead and ask questions.  Exactly.  Instead of just going, no, I don't want to talk about that, you had to be fucking radio prize  whore and try to get the hosts interested in you.  Because we told you you were boring.  You're boring.  And you don't like hearing that.  That's fine.  You're a boring person.  You really fit the fucking profile. 
[02:15:00]  Yep.  Your husband ignores you.  Yeah.  Cool.  What do I win?  Nothing.  You're a retarded kid.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  The kid's a victim in this.  Please.  Be nice.  Who even knows if she has a kid?  I don't even know if she has one.  Can your daughter communicate?  Is she verbal?  No.  Oh, no?  Really?  Wow.  Unfortunately, mom didn't have that.  Yeah.  And you were drunk.  She's what?  You're drunk. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Were you drinking?  Of course you are.  Don't lie.  God, I wish.  During pregnancy?  Wait.  Her kid doesn't talk?  No.  Non-communicating.  She's sound verbal.  Do you speak?  You could hear her kind of slapping in the background a little bit.  Who even know?  I don't even know if she has a kid.  No, actually, we speak.  Oh.  Say, making fun of your kid.  That's not nice.  That's good.  No.  At least I know you or your kid, so it's a little easier, but you shouldn't be making  fun of your own kid.  It's not her fault that you decide to drink during pregnancy.  Mommy, I'm hungry. 
[02:16:00]  Hold on.  I'll feed you in a minute.  Mommy has to go get some attention for herself.  Mommy has to go stay in the front yard and do something to draw attention to herself or  call a radio show.  Yeah.  Jimmy has to talk about dicks and ass because he can't get a wuss.  I can't get a wuss?  It's called a pussy.  It's called a cunt.  Yeah.  It's called a fucking, it's called a fucking, a pussy, not a wuss.  I didn't want to be, I didn't want to be.  It's called a baby maker.  You said dick and ass.  Oh, yeah.  In your case, why don't you say Jimmy just can't get a disaster area?  Exactly.  Holy shit. 
[02:16:30]  Where do you live?  What city do you live in?  Is it your womb lined with lead?  Hey, fallout shelter pussy.  What city do you live in?  Actually, that would be really, really funny if you think about it.  Yeah, I know it would be.  That's what we said.  Why don't you say what city do you live in?  City?  Philly.  Ah, Philly.  All right.  What's going on?  All right, so it's within range that I could beat you. 
[02:17:00]  Mm.  Yeah.  Would you like to meet Jimmy?  Why don't you come up and meet us?  Sure.  Why don't you meet Jimmy and maybe slip you a little dick?  What's that?  Slip you some cock.  I won't let you suck it, but how about this?  He doesn't have one.  Shh.  How about this?  I won't let you suck it, but I'll let you look at it.  Like, I'll wave it in front of your face a little.  Would you jerk off on her face?  Absolutely.  Okay.  How about Jimmy jerks off into your face?  But no touching.  Oh, God.  And do I have to get a magnifying glass?  Oh, Jimmy. 
[02:17:30]  No, she didn't.  You got a tiny cock.  You're saying, she's saying.  God, Jimmy's got a tiny cock.  That's not true.  This is a giant cock.  That's the last girl that was with Jimmy.  What?  What's that?  Do I have to go to Atlanta to the disease place?  Disease place.  It wouldn't affect me.  Well, it already affected me.  Wow.  Really?  Sorry.  This woman, maybe this woman and her daughter can go on a double date with you and Josh Blue. 
[02:18:00]  Dick balls, dick and ass, balls and dick.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be great?  Wouldn't you love that?  A guy.  Dick and balls.  Think about it.  She's trying to breathe out of her nose, but Jimmy's balls are all right up against her nostrils.  And they sweat.  And I have cranky ass, so I was nervous about our big date.  And normally I'd clean that, but for her I don't.  So I kind of rub my fucking sweaty ass on her nose, and I say, breathe.  Breathe it in.  I'd trap your head between my thighs.  And wipe some on his balls, too.  What's that, sweetie? 
[02:18:30]  What's that, Woody?  Nothing.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You have nothing.  You're a lonely woman, aren't you?  Where's Dad?  Actually, he just called a second ago.  What did he say?  Get off the phone, you embarrassing hole?  What did he say?  No, I didn't answer.  I was talking to you guys.  That's good.  Yeah, he's basically saying, well, you get off the fucking phone.  You're embarrassing me.  You're an embarrassment.  That's why he was calling.  You know that, right?  Cool.  Hey.  Cool, hey.  Yeah, cool.  Only once in a lifetime.  Yeah, once in a lifetime. 
[02:19:00]  Do you know how many times you get drunk and embarrass your husband?  Don't you understand that?  You're an attention whore, and you're embarrassing everyone in your life.  Just behave with dignity.  Comment?  Oh, God.  Like, he is the person we should all mock.  Gosh, I'm not calling radio shows begging for attention.  This is my job.  You're home.  Exactly.  Ew.  Now, you can continue to fake laugh, or you can really acknowledge what's going on, which  is that you're an embarrassment. 
[02:19:30]  You're an attention whore and an embarrassment.  Yeah.  Thank God.  And you're a joke.  Exactly.  Oh, Jimmy.  That's why he makes...  Oh, sorry.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  That's why he makes the money.  Because I'm a joke.  Yeah.  Why I make the money...  Okay, fine.  He's a jokester.  He got me.  But the bottom line of this, I'm a joke.  I make the money.  What you are goes beyond that.  Shh, shh, shh.  I didn't call to argue.  I just called to give you, you know...  No one's arguing. 
[02:20:00]  ...a little that.  You gave us nothing.  It's a shitty website.  I didn't call to get insulted.  Yes, you did.  You called for attention.  Any attention you can get, you'll take.  No.  I'm sorry.  You started insulting me.  You went on the phone for over an hour.  You started insulting me.  You're a pest.  Nobody wants to talk to you.  And you continue to call the radio show.  And then you get on and you insult me.  Then they could have said they don't want to talk to you.  You tell us purposefully either your kid is disabled or you make it up just to stay 
[02:20:30]  on the phone longer.  And then you play a game.  Guess what's wrong with my kid?  I cannot.  You're a disgrace.  That is a little insensitive, isn't it?  You're a disgrace.  I mean, we come up with these things.  Sometimes we don't expect people to actually go for it.  And it is kind of disgraceful that you did kind of use your handicapped daughter in radio  If she even has a daughter, because then she goes, oh, she can't communicate.  Therefore, we can't say put her on the phone or make her say hello.  Okay, hold on a second.  I don't want to talk to her. 
[02:21:00]  Come here, Cass.  Look at her.  She calls her kid over.  You guys asked me.  And you call your kid over.  What's her little name?  Her name's Cassandra.  Aw.  Cass.  Carey, boo-boo.  Way to give her a name.  She'll never spell.  Hey, stop.  Come on.  Poor Cass.  She talks to her kid like a fucking puppy.  I know.  No, because right now Jimmy has me kissed because my daughter is my most depressed thing.  Stop using her as a radio prop if she really exists.  Did she just say my daughter's my most depressing thing? 
[02:21:30]  My most precious.  Oh, precious.  You're trying to have cliched nonsense.  I hear.  I hear.  Hold on.  What are you, tickling the kid?  That's the kid cringing at her mother's embarrassing attempts at attention.  You know what the translation was?  Mom, get off the phone.  You're making an idiot of yourself.  Yeah, Mom, you're an ass.  Were you tickling little Cassandra?  No, I just put her up in my lap.  Oh.  11?  Cassie's not that little.  She's 80 pounds.  Why are we... 
[02:22:00]  At 11, 80 pounds?  Is that normal?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's all right.  That's small?  That's all right.  Is it?  Like my 11-year-olds with a little meat on them.  Look, you're depressing the shit out of everybody.  We feel bad for the kid.  I've got to step out of character here.  This is a downer now.  We feel bad for the kid.  Absolutely.  And we don't like you.  I'll speak for myself.  I feel bad for the kid.  Why?  Because you're bringing your kid on the radio.  What are you doing?  She's perfect.  I'm sure she's...  Yeah, she's not the problem.  Yeah, you are. 
[02:22:30]  Don't you get it?  All right.  Could you like leave now, please?  Why don't you just go away?  You guys are great.  Jimmy, kiss mine.  Oh, good one.  Go out with a bang.  She wants it.  She did, Jimmy.  She wants you so bad.  Is that...  It's a problem.  No, she does.  Somebody said to treat her.  She wants your cock.  Well, she knows I shave it, and she knows it looks good, and it's a good thickness, and  she probably just wants it in her face.  Yeah.  She wants to smell it.  Yeah.  She wants to breathe it in.  Everything.  She wants to clear stuff on her face. 
[02:23:00]  Yep.  Why am I saying that?  She tells more about your cock.  She does.  I don't know.  What is wrong with us?  I don't know.  So she had a slight...  You like you.  She had a slight problem with the show.  We just fucking destroyed it.  Yeah, but it was something about her.  It was so annoying.  She's exploitive, and she's a...  Boy, if there is ever a profile or candidate for that Munchausen...  Yeah, that was dead on.  Munchausen syndrome.  She just fucking attention whore.  She probably knows all the nurses and doctors and questions them and helps out. 
[02:23:30]  What do you need me to do?  I do.  No, no.  I give her the injections every day.  We know it.  And before you know it, they find out the kid's fine.  Mother's been pumping fucking toilet water into her.  That's what happens.  She's fucked up.  She's called before.  I recognize the cadence of her voice.  Yeah, she was annoying.  All right, listen.  We got to do line of the day and get the fuck out of here.  Greg Giraldo, thanks for stopping by.  My vote is...  Hey, two fellas.  Oh, my God.  That was depressing. 
[02:24:00]  Hey, but I want a lot of echo.  Can you put a lot of echo on me?  Hey, this is Lee Cherkerson.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The The Enemy Show.  And now, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, let's get the cockroach count.  This is all I thought about this weekend.  La cucarachas.  We learned last week that there are cockroaches that have completely invaded and taken over this facility. 
[02:24:30]  It's infested.  It's infested.  So, we laid down some traps on Friday, Saturday, somewhere Friday.  And now we get to see what our traps caught.  Sam has one of the traps in his hands.  Well, the other trap that was under a file cabinet just got one.  Oh, God.  That one's...  This one was under the sink and has...  The real problem is that there's, like, at least, I count six to seven baby cockroaches. 
[02:25:00]  Okay.  Which means they're reproducing.  Oh, wow.  Cockroaches reproducing?  Yes.  In an environment of filth and fucking food and disgust?  They're also all still alive because they're moving their antenna, but they can't move because  their feet are stuck.  They're trying to figure out.  They're trying to communicate.  Hey, my feet are stuck.  So are mine, idiots.  Talking to each other.  How are your feet?  Stuck.  I'm walking, but I'm not getting any closer.  What's happening?  It's glue, idiot. 
[02:25:30]  We're in a glue trap.  We disgust this.  We're so dead.  I'm walking.  You're not getting any closer.  Could you explain that?  Dead the cockroach.  It's had the imperceptive cockroach.  I'm hungry, but there's no food to be found, and I can't seem to get anywhere.  So there's a total of 16 baby cockroaches in this.  And full size is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine.  Nine full-size cockroaches.  Let me see that.  So there's 25 in this one trap alone?  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  Oh.  Where are the real big guys, though?  The big fatties?  Yeah.  Like the one that Poe stepped on the other day?  Oh, my God.  They're there.  One.  Yeah, he's right.  Look at how many cockroaches.  I can't stand the cockroach.  There's way more than 16.  Disgusting little bug.  There's a lot of really tiny ones in here.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,  fourteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen.  You said nineteen on the one side?  And then one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen. 
[02:26:30]  You missed fourteen.  You missed that guy?  Dude, there's thirty-something in this trap alone.  You miscounted.  Well, I got one in this trap, so that's correct.  And one in that?  Yes.  So there you go.  It'd be funny if there's all those roaches and a dog or a turtle.  Just some weird animal.  Hopefully, uh...  There's an armadillo in here.  Let's fuck it.  Hopefully, Travis's bulldog will get caught in one of these things.  Oh, that useless animal. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  Or Travis's beard.  And by that, I don't mean Lisa.  Here.  He's gay.  Here you go.  Oh, come on.  Eh, eh, eh, eh.  No, it's all right, Ed.  It's okay.  Because the road strap bounced right by you.  Yes, I know.  One of them might have fallen out.  Yeah.  Get that fucking...  Look, they're all moving around.  Do you think they're saying to each other,  Hey, uh, we just got thrown, and yet we didn't fall out.  What do you think happened?  It's new safety standards. 
[02:27:30]  Unfortunately.  Yeah, new safety standards.  That's why...  See, the glow's a good thing.  They don't want us to fall.  We're buckled up.  Yeah.  So now what?  Are we laying down some new traps?  Yeah, it puts another new trap under the sink,  because that's where the cornucopia of roaches came from.  Yeah, sure.  I put one in Poe's office,  because I can only assume how many roaches will be found in there.  Yeah.  All right.  So, yeah.  So not bad for our first hunt.  We got about 30 to 35 cockroaches in the two traps.  Well, the one trap wasn't impressive at all, but... 
[02:28:00]  No.  But, you know, it adds one.  Right.  Let's go to North Carolina again.  Sean.  What?  Yep.  You guys shouldn't be killing the cockroaches in studio,  because the eggs don't crush,  and then they sit on whatever you kill them with,  whether it be, like, sole of a shoe or something,  and then you transport those eggs into your home,  or whatever you decide to go from there.  Yeah.  Don't get me off the studio.  And then...  So you step on one,  and then you walk, like, three city blocks in the heat,  and then still, the eggs are still good. 
[02:28:30]  So you don't understand.  I don't actually step gingerly.  I moonwalk when I go home.  Yeah.  I moonwalk and dance.  You moonwalk over roaches.  Well, Jimmy, you might be okay if you moonwalk home.  Yeah, I do, because it's a strange time.  All right.  We're learning a lot about cockroaches.  A lot of people say,  don't step on the cockroaches.  You'll bring the eggs back to your house.  I don't step.  That was Poe.  Poe was the one that jumped on that.  Yeah.  How great would it be?  All of a sudden, he came home,  and there was fucking 50 roaches sitting on his front door.  Gentlemen.  50 less than usual?  Yeah.  I have a feeling that Poe has a lot of roaches at his house. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I hope not.  Being, um...  We should ask him.  You're profiling.  No.  They're creepy.  They're still moving in the trap.  Yeah.  They're icky.  Icky?  I thought you just cut it out.  And you're going to eat?  Yes.  Well, I'm not fucking...  That's what does it.  What's the matter there, Poe?  I'm not going to sit.  Poe's insulted.  Why?  Why is Poe insulted?  You have no roaches, right?  You have cockroaches at your house?  I guarantee it.  No, I don't have any roaches, but I had mice.  I don't have mice anymore. 
[02:29:30]  What happened?  You have mice still.  No, I got rid of them.  How did you get rid of the mice?  I got rid of them because I...  It's with a spinning back kick.  Tell me how you got rid of the mice and...  What happened is they were coming in through the dishwasher and I covered up the holes.  Oh.  Wow.  Oh, so you don't think you have mice anymore?  Well, they're not coming in anymore.  I don't see any more droppings.  They're there.  If they are, I haven't seen them.  Jimmy turned me on to the whole mice thing.  I go, Jimmy, I found a mouse in my apartment.  And Jimmy freaked out. 
[02:30:00]  He goes, if you have one, that means you have hundreds.  I'm like, shut up, Jimmy.  No fucking way.  I got just one dumb stray mouse.  And I killed that motherfucker in a glue trap and then proceeded to kill between 50 and 60 more with electric traps.  Infestation.  Yes.  Jimmy was correct.  Oh, they're all around you.  They're just trying to figure out how to get back into your apartment because they know that's where the good eats are.  Good eats.  Yeah.  The num-nums.  Huh?  How'd you get rid of the mice?  I made a deal with them. 
[02:30:30]  We played tic-tac-toe.  I won three out of four games.  They had to leave.  You temporarily got rid of the mice, my friend.  So they're still there, right?  Yeah.  I would guarantee it.  You know what?  Any of those electric traps around?  I'm not sure.  Set one of those electric traps.  I guarantee.  I will bet you $100, but then I don't know if you're going to be bullshitting me.  Shocking.  That you find one by tomorrow morning.  If I set the trap.  One electric trap.  I'll bring it in.  Put some peanut butter in there.  Okay.  All right?  You got it. 
[02:31:00]  I'm telling you they're still around.  Let's say hi to Dave in New York.  Dave.  Yeah.  Hey, Dave.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Good evening.  Hey, you.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Do you work in New York City?  Yeah, I work in New York City.  I'm a pest control operator.  I'm licensed in New York and New Jersey.  And I just wanted to let you know you can rest easy, Opie.  You know, those egg casings can be dropped in a bucket of acid and nothing will get inside them.  But if you crush them with your shoe, there's nothing that's going to hatch from them. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  What if one gets in the, you know, the...  Yeah, the tread.  The tread of your sneaker or something.  No, they can't.  You know, they got to move around.  They can be killed very easily when they're very small.  Sir, the way I kill roaches is I sit on them bare bottom.  What are some of the eggs you're cutting my ass hair?  Oh, jeez.  I don't have an answer for that.  I wish I did, but...  Hey, Dave.  Just want to let me know.  Dave, screw the roaches.  I want to know about rats.  You do pest control in New York City?  Yes, I do. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  What's your feeling on rats?  How many rats are in New York City?  Millions.  Millions.  Millions.  Rats, Marco.  Millions.  Millions.  You know, I go out and I fight the good fight every day, but there's more and more.  I read, I finally, I never told anyone, finally got to the end of that rat book that I've  been, you know, picking up every once in a while and just fascinated with rats.  Yeah, they're everywhere.  Why don't we see more rats then?  Everyone says there's millions and millions in New York City, but you rarely see one. 
[02:32:30]  Usually they're nocturnal.  You won't see them until the infestation is so big that they're running around in the  street during the day.  Right.  So, you know, they burrow underneath and every once in a while, like if you're driving up  West Street and you know how they have those little, you know, those concrete things with  the trees coming out of them on the promenade.  Yeah.  Every once in a while, you'll see one of them popping out or popping out of the sewer.  From there, they're just going to grab something and they're running right back into the hole.  So, you know, I see a good amount of rats, not now that they're not doing construction,  but Washington Square Park. 
[02:33:00]  When you walk by at like three in the morning at the park, you just see like the leaves  scuffling constantly.  They're moving around.  It is infested.  All parks are infested with rats.  Yeah, especially in the subway systems also.  I mean, there's not any time of the day you can go down in the subway and see multiple  rats.  I know that when I'm walking to the studio in the morning, any garbage day, just pick  any garbage day that there's a bag on the street of New York.  If you kick it, rats will come running out of them.  And it's happened to be a bunch of times.  If they actually come towards you and they turn around real quick, they can get you with 
[02:33:30]  their tail.  And that hurts like a sumbitch.  How bad have you seen like roach infested apartments or rat infested apartments?  I've actually lifted up drop ceilings in office buildings and apartments where it actually  pours down on me.  It looks like a shower head full of cockroaches are coming down on me.  Oh, they just start pouring out of the ceiling?  Yeah, it's disgusting.  I actually, when we're going in to do a clean out, I have to wear something similar to like 
[02:34:00]  a tight turtleneck kind of thing and zip up my cover all the way to the top.  How about a glue hat in case they fall on your head?  Glue hat.  A hat made of glue.  I wear earplugs.  It's gross.  My neighbors think I'm insane.  I've got to strip down before my wife lets me into the apartment.  I'm standing out there in my boxes before I can.  I've got to bag everything up before I can come into my apartment.  And the thing about rats, you'll never get rid of them.  They get smarter with all the stuff you guys are coming out with to kill them, right? 
[02:34:30]  They learn?  It's true.  Well, rats are smarter than actually mice because what a rat will do is send a probe rat out.  If there's something new in the environment, when we date, they'll send a probe rat out  just to check it out, see what's going on, and if they come back and everything is all  right, then they'll bring a few more of his buddies.  It's actually kind of spooky.  A probe rat.  Is that why, like, they've done studies on rats.  They've actually heard, when you listen real close, one going, but it's not my turn.  All right.  You got point.  I don't want to go. 
[02:35:00]  I have a bad feeling about this one.  What's going to end up happening with the rats, let's say, in New York City?  Is it going to get to a point where, or do they control themselves because there's not  enough food?  Like, how does that work?  Why aren't they continuing to multiply to the point where we have to just give up and leave  New York City?  Well, actually, if there's not enough food, they will turn to cannibalism.  Right.  You know, so it's just kind of a delicate balance between baiting enough and then taking enough  food and harborage away.  You know, this is where, like, the Parks Department comes in. 
[02:35:30]  Like, if they keep all the stuff trimmed properly, then there's no harborage for them.  You know, we need to be doing a regular baiting thing on a regular basis for some of these  areas where, you know, a lot of these, they wouldn't allow baiting before, that kind of  thing.  What do you mean by baiting?  Like, like, like, say, telling one rat that the other one said something about him?  Wait, why wouldn't they allow baiting?  Well, because you go, you get a lot of these typical conservationists in New York City that 
[02:36:00]  won't allow, you know, they feel that a rat is, is, you know, an animal and, you know,  animals have all of your life and that kind of thing.  So the conservationists in New York State, especially in New York City, have kind of tied  our hands and kept us from doing the proper thing.  We're fucking doomed.  Yeah, that's pretty much what's throwing us in.  Are you kidding me?  Ridiculous environmentalists.  That's it.  That's it.  I mean, I'm kind of glad you're here.  I have a job.  That's how I pay the bills.  I, um, recently I was walking home, um, after a late night, uh, drink with some, uh, some 
[02:36:30]  of the Philly crew and stuff.  And we were walking by a brownstone and there was some garbage and I saw a rat go running  into like the front area of a brownstone where there's some garbage, right?  I go, wow, that's cool.  And I went in for a closer look and I swear to God, and maybe you could tell me what this  means, that the rat hissed at me.  I didn't see it anymore.  Yeah, no shitty hiss at you.  It started hissing.  What does that mean?  Was there babies in the area?  It was a cat.  No, no.  Usually what happens is when you get too close and a rat is trapped, it'll get up on his 
[02:37:00]  hind legs and kind of do this hissing, kind of guttural sound kind of to scare something  away.  Or choose your face off.  Dude, let me tell you, I was fucking petrified because it was dark and all I heard was this  hissing coming from the darkness.  I couldn't run fast enough.  Yeah, it's, it's disgusting.  And the problem with rats is on a hardness index, their teeth are actually harder than  steel.  Is there a way when the rat's like standing up like that and hissing?  Did you hear that? 
[02:37:30]  You can't just blow by that.  Their teeth are harder than steel.  Oh, okay.  On a hardness index, yeah, they can actually...  Why don't they make buildings out of rat teeth?  Smarty.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  But that's an amazing, like, fact about rats.  They could gnaw through anything is basically what this guy's saying.  Yeah, they can actually gnaw through sewer jars, anything, you know, below ground, any  conduit that carries pipe, that carries, you know, electrical wiring, anything like that.  So they're really, really a nasty, nasty, nasty problem. 
[02:38:00]  And they also know how to unlock their own jaws so they can, like, get through, like, tiny  areas and stuff.  They unhinged their own jaws.  Yeah, they don't have bones.  They have carolage.  Yeah, they can flatten their skeletons out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If they can get their head into something, they can get their whole body.  You can actually take a rat and fold him backwards to where his head is touching his paint kind  of things, and he won't break his bones.  I heard that's the equivalent of tickling a rat.  He loves it.  If you fold him backwards, you can actually hear them go, tee hee. 
[02:38:30]  Look, I'm sniffing my own asshole.  Yeah, they kind of laugh about it, like, oh, you got me.  You got me.  Rats are good-natured about the ribbing.  Yeah.  The one thing about this book that I read, they said at any given time, I think I mentioned  this on the air, but at any given time when you're walking around New York City, you're  within feet of a rat.  Yeah.  They said there's all sorts of tunnels under every sidewalk.  They're in the walls of almost every building. 
[02:39:00]  They're just everywhere.  Very true.  Let me ask you.  Very true.  It's like a whole network moving right under your feet while you're walking on the sidewalk.  What about this way of getting rid of them?  I've heard this might work.  Whereas, like, what you do is you get into their, like, nests, and you take out their  little positive affirmations that they hang, and you write negative things, and it depresses  them.  You could do that.  Send them in undercover like a little rat 21 Jump Street or something.  I don't know.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[02:39:30]  Good knowledge.  Thanks, guys.  A little knowledge today for everybody.  Let's go to Louisiana.  Carly.  Carly, what's up?  I'm going to wipe that out.  Hey, guys.  I have to tell you what happened to me.  I've never heard this happening to anybody else.  I'm building a house in the country, and before it's finished, we move in.  One night, well, needless to say, the mice just infested the house.  Wait, is there a country field behind it?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Are those probably the mice from the field?  Field mice? 
[02:40:00]  Okay, no doubt.  Oh, okay.  The house is infested.  One night, I'm in bed.  Miss, I don't mean to interrupt you, but you said you hadn't finished the house.  Was the roof on yet?  The roof was on.  Okay.  It didn't rain on your bed, did it?  It had an area that was obviously open.  Okay.  So my boyfriend and I are asleep in bed one night.  Was it spackled?  Yes.  And why aren't you married?  You're going to live with somebody.  Do you not want the Lord to accept you in?  Let's get to the real need of it.  Living in sin.  Yes, he sent mice and pestilence to your sinful home. 
[02:40:30]  That was a place.  Were there locusts in your bedroom, you whore?  Flaming hail coming down on your roof.  I'm kidding, Miss.  Go ahead.  I apologize.  Okay, so we are awakened by the roof.  How much of the insulation was in place at the time?  That's right, ma'am.  What percentage?  Was there a fire in your home?  Because you said it's never happened.  You've never heard it happening to anybody.  So what has never happened?  Because I haven't finished the store.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, we need to know about your unfinished house first.  It's just an area that was unfinished. 
[02:41:00]  There's no floors or toilets.  They just put a wooden structure around dirt on a field and they live in it.  All right, Carly.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, madam.  I apologize.  It's okay.  So we're awakened by the worst noise you've ever heard.  We throw the door open.  We don't know what is going on.  Wait, the worst noise I've ever heard.  Oh, really?  Wow.  My mind is going 1,000 miles an hour and it's coming up with nothing.  Yeah.  Okay, so the worst noise you've ever heard.  So your door opened.  I'm here and I've got an idea. 
[02:41:30]  We can start there, Jimmy.  And continue.  E-Rock, have you seen my toothbrush?  Or, um, hi, I'm rich.  I'll be teaching your children.  I said that was a rich foster.  Okay.  Yes.  All right, Carly.  Worst noise you've ever heard.  We throw the door open and there is a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds going on in the house.  The birds have circulated a memo that this is Mouse House.  And there are like 2,000 birds killing the mice all in the house. 
[02:42:00]  Wait, 2,000 birds?  Okay, maybe 200.  That's still a lot of birds.  The house is black with birds.  The house is black.  How do the birds get in?  What does your house look like?  Well, it's a little house on a stick and it just has a hole in the front.  And that's where we live.  And the floor has all kinds of little seeds on it.  Seed floor.  Yes.  It's a gingerbread house and the birds like it.  And I can't even, like, talk to my boyfriend because it's too loud. 
[02:42:30]  We're having to scream at each other.  Were your floors made of newspaper?  Maybe they misunderstood.  Yes.  My house is made of cage wiring.  What's that?  It was that.  It was crazy.  And the birds flew in and they killed all the mice.  And it went on for like 45 minutes.  And then they all left.  And we never had mice again and we finished the house.  Sounds like a scene out of Evan Almighty.  That's amazing.  It was horrible.  All right, Carly.  Okay.  Thank God you're all right. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, let's go to Dwayne in Minnesota.  Dwayne.  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  What's up, Dwayne?  I don't know much.  I was just going to tell you to shut up and let her finish your story.  But after that ending, you know.  Well, you see, we were kind of just.  Dwayne, here's the brilliance of us because I see what you're saying up there.  Do you have to ruin every story?  We knew that story was going nowhere fast.  So we were trying to get some humor out of it.  No, I didn't know where it was going, Dwayne.  I mean, the bottom line is I knew she was going to get to the end.  We were having fun with her along the way. 
[02:43:30]  What you don't understand about, like, if we just were to let her say it, then you have  to go back and recapture moments that you wanted to goof on.  It doesn't work.  So a lot of times.  I got you, Jimmy.  Okay.  Look at that.  He's cutting you off now.  All right.  He understands.  All right, Dwayne.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's take a couple more here.  Keith in Jersey.  Keith.  Yo, how you doing?  Oh, hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I got a little story for Opie and his little garbage experiences.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  I used to live in Manhattan, and after a nice long night of drinking, our stupid little  game was to kick the garbage piles on garbage night and watch all the rats scatter.  Fuck.  We would all run after the rats and try stomping on them.  And we used to catch a couple of them and make a nice little splatter.  That's like serial killer shit, though.  Yeah.  You know, there's a way to get rid of rats without just stomping on them with your boot. 
[02:44:30]  By the way, that's a cool beginning to a story.  That's not a cool story.  That's a cool beginning.  That should be part one.  I think if you lined up 100 guys, I think there's maybe one that would actually run after  a rat and try to stomp it to death.  Stomp it.  The rest of them, even though we'd all act like we're brave, most of us would be like,  fuck that.  You know the best way to catch rats, and I found this, is you dip your dick in cheese.  Ah.  And then when the rats grab onto it, you flick their little heads. 
[02:45:00]  That sends out a message.  All right.  Let's go to Tony and Jerry.  Tony.  Hey, Jimmy, you're on fire today.  You're fucking killing me.  Oh, thank you.  I had a huge bong hit.  It was probably a $6 toque, I swear to God.  And you said my house is on a stick with a hole in the front.  I lost the whole fucking thing I talked for two minutes.  You owe me, kid.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted to let you know.  Right on, man.  Let's go to Kansas City.  I didn't mean that, though, because that was a birdhouse.  Hey, guys, this is Kansas City Dave.  Kansas City Dave, what's up?  How you guys doing?  All right.  I used to go to Oklahoma and stay with my ex-wife still because I still fucked her for 
[02:45:30]  a little while there after we got divorced.  And the last time I stayed at her house, I woke up and I felt something crawling and I  flipped the covers up and there was a fucking roach crawling out of my ass crack that was  obviously under her covers when I was in the bed.  By the way, do you know right now that roach is somewhere saying, and I thought it was a  good place to hide, all of a sudden warm, disgusting air passed over me.  I was in a guy's asshole. 
[02:46:00]  And all his friends are laughing at him like, what'd you do?  The guy just got the hell out of there.  Grossest thing ever.  Yeah.  For both of you.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Frank at Freehold.  Freehold.  Freehold.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up?  Hey, nothing much.  I wanted to tell you guys, I used to work for Con Edison, man.  Did you?  And a lot of the way that the roaches get into the buildings is through the duct work.  If we used to do a service job, if we didn't do a complete service job all the way,  you have to pack all the duct work.  And if you don't do that, the roaches are definitely getting in the building that way. 
[02:46:30]  I want to find where the roaches are hanging out in this freaking facility.  The big guys.  Where we take down something and all of a sudden they...  They just scurry all over the place.  That's what I'm looking for with this whole thing.  Let's go to Tom in Texas.  Tom.  Hey, guys.  The problem with baiting rats is that they die in your walls and it smells bad.  And also it can kill your dog or cat if the rat's dead. 
[02:47:00]  So I was going to say the whole conservation thing, it's more of just, you know, circle of life crap, you know,  where a hog will eat a rat that's been had the stuff in it and also it dies in your walls  and you have to tear down walls to get the little fella out of your hair.  The circle of death.  But it stinks.  It stinks.  Yeah, it seems like it would smell a dead rat in your wall.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Enough about the rats.  Hey, this is Andre Royal from The Wire. 
[02:47:30]  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  And now the worst.  Just pathetic.  Of Opie and Anthony.  They call it toilet humor.  Toilet humor.  We're going to start today's festivities.  I got in front of me a water bug.  Dude, we have roaches here.  It's fucking annoying.  We, yeah.  I don't want it near me.  This fucking place is disgusting.  The food.  If you go around that side there and make the left where the refrigerator is, 
[02:48:00]  they scurry.  They scurry like the fucking pieces of shit they are.  And I mean the interns.  And then the cockroaches are even worse.  What do you want roaches to do?  Hang out and wait for a fucking...  No one's going to go...  A shoe.  A shoe.  Wait for a big shoe.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's a big one, too.  The first of many.  Holy fuck.  Get that out of here.  What are you, crazy?  Dude, it's in the machine now. 
[02:48:30]  What the fuck?  Are you nuts?  I don't want the roach on me.  Oh!  I'm done.  Get my truck.  I'm out of here.  Dude, why didn't you fucking...  Dude, are you crazy?  You're not going to find it now.  It's pissed.  Well, step on it.  You guys are fucking talking to it.  It's going to kill the fucking thing.  God almighty.  We're all reacting like Steve C. looking at a pussy.  All right, listen. 
[02:49:00]  Do you got it?  You got it?  Because I want to fuck it.  Those are fucking disgusting.  You better have smashed that thing.  Smash it.  Smash it.  Oh, smash it.  Kill it.  No, keep it away from Poe, because he's afraid of them.  All right.  Kill it.  Wow, nice move, Dan.  Here, show it to Poe.  I want to see the Poe freak out.  Where's Poe?  Poe, come here.  Poe!  Hey, Dan. 
[02:49:30]  How about you show him away from my chair?  By my fucking food prep area here.  I have a sandwich.  No, no, no.  Keep him away.  Oh, he's a roach.  No, no, no.  That's right.  No, no, no.  Keep him away.  No, no, no.  Keep him away.  Poe, really?  You're scared of cockroaches?  No, no, no.  Keep him away.  Well, he is Puerto Rican.  I know.  They're like fucking...  I'm sure he didn't name it already.  Yeah.  All right, Poe, get over there.  Come on, Poe.  You're a fucking martial artist.  You protect us.  Did you just give it breathing holes?  That's very courteous, Dan.  There's enough air in that cup for a year for that fucking little thing. 
[02:50:00]  Fucking raid doesn't kill them.  You already have to pass out.  They need to bring it some milk.  Yeah.  They eat shit, Dan.  Give it a little treat.  This is the first of many that are going to be caught.  But let Poe take a look at the cockroach.  Why do you want me to look at him?  He's underneath the cup.  He's safe.  He's going to run.  We want to see who would win, Master Poe or a cockroach.  He won.  Hands down.  All right.  Reveal the cockroach.  No, I'm going to kill it, though.  All right. 
[02:50:30]  Then you kill it.  Let's see.  Wait.  Reveal it, though.  Fight it, Poe.  Fight it.  Fight the cockroach.  You want me to fight the cockroach?  Wait.  Give the cockroach a running start.  It was on his back when we recaptured it.  Wait, Poe, you have to take this thing off.  Hold on.  No.  No, Danny will take it off to make sure it starts running.  I want to give this thing a chance.  You're not going to run away from him.  No, it's not.  I'm going to kill it.  I'm going to kill it.  No, just...  What are we doing?  Bobby, I'm going to kill it.  Give me a stick.  Get me my stick.  Where's my stick?  Pop.  All right.  Ready?  Where's my stick? 
[02:51:00]  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Get my stick.  My stick.  I need my stick.  Danny, is it going to run when you...  Dude, I can kill it.  It wants to leave that cup immediately.  Okay.  Here we go.  Without the broom.  Here we go.  Wait, hold on.  Poe versus a cockroach.  Hold on.  I have to get my weapon.  You don't need a weapon.  What are you going to run?  Well, you've got to get near it.  He's going to run.  All right.  Here we go.  Danny's going to...  One, two, three.  Three, two, three.  Oh, damn.  Fucking damn.  You've been pulled. 
[02:51:30]  Wow.  You used every muscle in your leg to do that.  Puerto Rican accuracy.  I love how you strutted around like you just kicked the shit out of something a trillionth  of your size.  You think that was fucking Randy Cotoros.  You went down, bitch.  That's right.  I'm not even looking at his eyes anymore.  You can't be more dead than that cockroach is right now.  Not at all.  That was a direct hit.  Oh, boy.  Well, we've been talking about the cockroaches.  See, Bobby, we told you cockroaches in the drop ceiling yesterday. 
[02:52:00]  You thought we were bullshitting, but that's the one thing that is true.  There are a lot of cockroaches in this building now.  And he was fast.  Or in this area.  Well, this is what we want to do.  We want to do cockroach wars with the interns.  Cockroach wars?  Yeah, we want them to set up traps this weekend and see who could, you know...  Oh, like a hunt.  Yeah, see who could...  We want cockroach hunting.  See who could capture the most cockroaches between now and Monday.  Cream Pie Jones said he would eat a cockroach.  Well, there it is on the floor.  Right there.  Lick it up, motherfucker. 
[02:52:30]  No, don't do it.  That's not good.  Cream Pie.  Cream.  It's sanitary, right?  That's a fucking roach.  Roach.  Oh, don't do it, dude.  Don't do it.  Cream Pie, get on all fours.  Get out of the way, Sam.  Get out of the way, Sam.  I want to be honest.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  You've got to be kidding me.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  He has picked up the cockroach.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  Cream Pie.  He's shown it around.  You've got to be kidding. 
[02:53:00]  And...  He's opening his mouth.  He sees the eye.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God damn.  Holy shit.  Oh, fuck.  He ate a cockroach.  It slipped on the floor.  Oh, stride even.  Oh, shit.  Dude, you are worse than Asians.  Oh, man.  He ate something that touched a Puerto Rican. 
[02:53:30]  Post dry heating over here.  All right.  Very, very good.  Cream Pie Jones.  Yes.  That was really unbelievable.  Good job.  Don't ever speak to me again.  So we're going to do cockroach wars.  That was a hell of a closer.  Are people working on their trapping devices?  What do we got so far?  I don't like cockroach wars.  It sounds like you want fighting cockroaches.  All right.  What do you want to call it?  Like some kind of hunt thing. 
[02:54:00]  Cockroach hunt?  Cockroach hunt.  Okay.  Whackaroach.  So far, Cream Pie Jones and Hip Hop Ron have both gotten strongly behind this thing,  and they're both competing with each other.  Oh, really?  I feel like you guys have moved past the dude eating a fucking giant cockroach pretty quick.  Anyway, so now what do we do now?  You know what?  We are so desensitized at this point.  We talk about it from time to time.  His stomach is so fucking nice.  That's why we like guys in here that aren't as desensitized.  We've seen it all at this point.  He wore... 
[02:54:30]  Cream Pie Jones actually wore a shit hat.  I took a dump at CDS.  It was a fucking pile of nastiness, and he fucking put his hands in the toilet, and he  put his...  It was called a duty hat.  He made a duty hat.  He made a duty hat.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Big boy made a duty.  This was on two separate occasions, though.  There was one occasion of the duty hat, and then there was another occasion of him just  lifting up what looked like a pulled pork sandwich out of the toilet bowl, and then  waved goodbye to it and put it back and flushed it away.  Bye-bye.  And he had to say, bye-bye, duty. 
[02:55:00]  We got to show him that video.  We had it, right?  Big boy makes a duty.  We were extremely disappointed that this didn't take the internet by storm, by the way, Greg.  Yeah, how could it not?  I think we had 112 people view this video.  There's a guy wearing a shit hat, and that didn't get any views.  What do you got to do to get anybody's attention?  Yeah, really.  Yeah.  I want to talk about the cockroaches as he finds that video.  Now, how many cockroaches have we really seen?  Oh, so fucking many back there.  Have you seen them, man? 
[02:55:30]  Yes.  I'm hearing just rumors.  I haven't seen them.  There have been sightings.  Like, people who have come here and have seen them right where the new studio comes in,  right where the audience is.  There's at least two seen there.  When they were cleaning the back sink, like the first clean that happened at the beginning  of the week, they found six in one shot.  Like, six just started running around.  Do we know where they might be hiding?  In that sink?  In the back of this?  Yeah, there's two fridges.  There's the front fridge, and then the rear fridge, and the Rana Fez office.  The front fridge, if anybody has anything in there, just forget about it. 
[02:56:00]  Don't put anything in that fridge.  I've opened that fridge and seen roaches running inside of the fridge.  They creep up on you.  How the fuck did they get in there?  I don't know, but the roaches live in the ice in that fridge.  Like, the ice maker has ice and roaches in it, and the roaches are moving around.  They're fucking dinosaurs.  Right now?  I don't know if they're there now, but...  Someone go look.  I really want to find, like...  Because they say if you see a couple, that means there's hundreds, possibly thousands.  That means there's a million.  All right, where are they then?  There's got to be a place where they're really hiding. 
[02:56:30]  They're hiding the walls.  We found at least a dozen here this week.  This week alone?  Yeah.  And how are we going to capture these things?  Get some glue traps.  Okay.  Glue traps.  Glue traps for roaches?  Yeah, yeah.  That'll work?  Absolutely.  Restaurants do that.  You lay them out because when it gets dark, they come running around, you know, trying  to find food.  And then they go, whoa!  And they get stuck.  Yeah, because we've got to have proof.  Yeah.  Jim, how can you eat after that?  Yeah, just keep that up.  I mean, I'll get it.  There's nothing I can't eat through.  How about we get, how about we all, how about this? 
[02:57:00]  We all get a glue, we all get a glue trap.  It's like, it's just a piece of paper with really heavy glue on it.  And we all write our names on each one.  And then we see which one gets the most cockroaches.  Who gets the best placement, though?  Yeah.  Everybody picks their own place.  Yeah, but everyone's going to pick by the fridge.  I want under the fridge.  I got under the fridge.  I get the spot near Erock's mouth.  I say bait. 
[02:57:30]  Everybody has to choose their own bait style.  There's a shitting rhinoceros caught in yours.  They're not going to get away from a glue trap, I'm telling you.  At least we'll have...  For Erock.  Any chance to rag on Erock?  Let's get some...  Oh, fuck.  So why don't we get those glue things and we'll start there.  Yeah. 
[02:58:00]  All right.  Jimmy.  I love it.  Did they check behind the refrigerator?  I don't know.  That's a good idea.  We're going to do that right now.  If you pull that fridge out, it's just going to look like...  All right, Sam, why don't you do that?  Get a mic, though.  Mr. Pratt's apartment from fucking...  Hip-hop, is that on?  Creepshow.  Yeah, it's done.  Yeah, there it is.  All right.  Fucking creepshow.  All right, they're going to the back fridge.  What's the matter, Mr. Pratt? 
[02:58:30]  Bugs got your tongue?  What?  Oh, there it is.  They found one?  Yeah, Creepi found one.  Yeah, we've got one more.  Oh, look at this.  Wait, shoot your head.  Check out the new ice maker.  Yeah, Pat, the ice maker.  I just checked the new ice maker.  All right, they're checking around the...  There.  What?  Whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  That's why I love the show.  Full volume, thank you. 
[02:59:00]  I wrote you, man.  Oh, shit.  Fucking sad.  Mr. Pratt.  Mr. Pratt.  You got it?  Ugh.  Sam, what do we got?  Heads up, he's got one.  Pat's picking him up with his hands.  How many?  No.  There's like seven.  There's one baby.  Seven?  They're all over.  Dude, it's infested.  I swear to God, it is infested.  We just moved a file cabinet.  They found one.  Then they moved a garbage can.  They started yelling because there was three behind a garbage can. 
[02:59:30]  They're all over.  When you have that many roaches with this much daylight activity,  you've got a fucking problem.  This place is fucking infested.  Duffy has two baby ones.  Two babies.  Good.  Duffy.  Just smashing the place apart.  I love that one minute you're deconstructing those subtleties of the legal system,  and the next minute there's people licking the back of the fridge for roaches.  Yes, a multifaceted program we have here. 
[03:00:00]  What?  There's two little ones right here.  You got two little ones?  Yeah.  What do you tend to do to them?  I could snort them.  What are they, babies?  Yeah, they're little guys.  Would you do that?  Sure.  Wait, and now cream pie's coming in with more.  Oh, cream pie's stealing my thunder again.  What do you got, cream pie?  Just one.  Just one.  One little guy?  He ate one.  He did eat one.  Ugh.  Fucking things disgust me.  I think we're about to take out the microwave that's over there to see what's behind it. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's going to be an ugly scene.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Move the microwave.  This is so bad.  I would love to see this place at night.  All right.  This is so fucking bad.  I'm always moving the microwave with a broomstick.  Somebody grab the microwave.  Grab who's going to fall.  Grab who's going to fall.  Fuck it up.  Grab who's going to fall.  All right.  Well, he's willing to snort the roaches, huh? 
[03:01:00]  You guys are just sensitive.  Jesus, what happened?  How's a real man with this broom?  Nothing.  Well, they're scared now.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  More people over there.  That will get them out.  There's nothing behind the microwave, but right on top of the microwave is all old condiments  that have been there.  So that's what's being checked out right now.  Oh.  Who puts food in there?  Oh.  What?  Who puts food in there?  I don't know.  Who put it in there?  Who eats it?  Who would store that food in that fucking shit box?  Jonathan Schwartz. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, really?  Frank's place.  Frank's place.  Fucking go out for lunch.  What do you guys make, eight grand a year?  Chislers?  There's two more dead ones.  Found two more?  Yes, two more.  Did you guys check under the sink?  Because I know that.  I went in there for paper towels the other day, and a bunch ran out.  Oh, really?  All right.  Go under the sink.  Nothing under the sink right now.  There's nothing under the sink right now.  I left my cookies there, too, a couple days ago.  Oh, forget about those.  I'm kidding.  We'll see.  Oh, just say you took it.  They cleaned under the sink the other day.  That's where they found six in one shot.  Who's that? 
[03:02:00]  Who's cleaning?  The interns.  Did any of them get in my bowl of oatmeal?  Yeah.  Exactly.  So we're going to do cockroach hunting, all right?  Get those glue things.  We'll give it the weekend so they can kind of re-accumulate.  Yeah.  They'll fuck, have kids.  The kids will fuck, have kids.  We throw that glue shit down, though.  That's just the Puerto Ricans.  And we'll capture a lot.  Let's say hi to Mike in Michigan.  Mike?  Mike?  Yeah.  Hey, Mike. 
[03:02:30]  Hey, if you open the microwave up or back of your televisions up, you'll find even more.  They like the electronics.  Yep.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Great.  Let's go to Andy in Indiana.  Andy?  Yeah, I just wanted to warn you guys.  If you're stomping on those roaches, that's what releases the eggs.  It's going to cause a bigger infestation.  Shut up.  These guys. 
[03:03:00]  Not if we get interns to eat it.  Yeah, not that.  They like it.  It's like, there are some.  Let's say hi to Darwin in Newark.  I just think it's funny, by the way, that we would actually have a glue trap by Erock's  mouth, but a shitting rhinoceros is such a big animal.  Yes.  To stick in a glue trap.  And then to discover it.  That would have to be the weakest shitting rhinoceros. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  Can't get out of that glue trap.  What's up, Darwin?  Yo, you guys are smart as hell.  XM cannot afford to get an exterminator, so he got you guys to manipulate a way to get  these guys to do the job for them.  Very nice.  Cool.  Mental focal.  Yeah, well, XM hasn't really done any upkeep lately.  No, they don't have enough money for much of anything.  To the point where we're infested with cockroaches.  Yes, Sam.  I think I might know one of the reasons the cockroaches is there.  Behind that file cabinet where we just found a bunch, we also found an old bottle of Erock's 
[03:04:00]  Hawaiian Punch.  Erock.  Ladies and gentlemen, Green Pie Jones.  Green Pie Jones.  What do you want me to do?  They wanted me to make cumzies.  Cumzies.  Green Pie.  She's squeezing his eye.  Green Pie.  I'm touching his penis.  Green Pie.  It's a full erection.  Green Pie.  Oh, my God.  Green Pie.  She's stuck in my titties. 
[03:04:30]  Green Pie.  I'm such a worm.  Green Pie.  She's jerking off on her tits.  Green Pie.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I think he made the cumzies.  He made the cumzies.  The cumzies.  He made the cumzies.  He made the cumzies.  The cumzies.  Green Pie.  Green Pie.  What brilliant new stunt is Pat doing for the Opie and Anthony show now?  Hey, don't expect me to supply you with anything.  Pat Duffy, everyone.  He's right over there.  Hey, Pat, you got a...  I don't know.  You got a stunt for everybody today? 
[03:05:00]  Sure.  I wanted to stick those in my nose.  The bugs.  I don't know if you want to do that or not.  You want to snort up like a baby cockroach?  Or I could brush my teeth with those bugs.  I have a toothbrush in my backpack.  I say he snorts up the baby cockroaches.  Yeah, snorting cockroaches would be good.  I like the fact that we're like glancing over and brush your teeth with roaches like  it's old hats.  Yeah.  Oh, that's when you do dog shit.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to top dog shit.  Hey, snazzy dresser, is your mic working?  Yeah, my mic's on.  Greg, have you ever seen Two Girls, One Cup, that video? 
[03:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I know.  Because I was saying, you know, if you're grossed out by that, I mean, that...  I know.  That was pretty dumb.  That fucking video.  That's kind of silly.  Are they still alive in there, the baby cockroaches?  Yeah.  How are you going to snort them?  I don't know.  I was just going to kind of kill them first so they don't curl in my brain and kill me?  Yeah.  I mean, if you're a pussy, sure.  Yeah.  I say kill them first.  I really don't think there's a way to get from your nose to your brain.  Yeah.  Unless they have fucking...  Well...  God damn, I was trying to think of a small brain joke.  Couldn't.  Asshole I am.  Are they dead? 
[03:06:00]  They are now.  All right.  Lay them on the table in front of everybody.  All right.  How about that table?  Which one else?  Yeah, they have the clear one over there in front of the whole crowd.  The whole crowd, see?  Yeah.  Don't bout the cockroaches.  No, don't knock the roaches.  The audience will prove that this is real.  There you go.  Oh, God.  That's fine.  He's just struggling.  God damn you will always stand in my way, Sam.  Are you going to use a straw?  Are you going to use a straw or something?  That doesn't help your big fucking head of hair.  You fucking Boondocks comic strip looking motherfucker. 
[03:06:30]  Jesus.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Pat Duffy's going to snort baby cockroaches.  He hit hip-hop Ron in the balls.  Yeah.  He's just deciding him a ball shot.  Here we go.  Oh, you heard him.  Let each one go off. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, man.  I felt that.  All right.  They're in.  Delicious.  Pat's a fucking man's man.  You heard of each going.  Yeah.  Like it made the sound.  He's just punching him in the balls.  All right, then.  Holy shit.  Where are they lodged right now?  I feel two go down my throat.  And then I'm not sure where the oil it is. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, something.  A sinus laying its eggs.  E-Rock's having a slight problem in there.  What's the matter, E-Rock?  You all right?  What's wrong?  Bring him in.  Bring E-Rock in.  E-Rock, come in here, young Eric.  We miss you.  Look at how fat he's gotten.  Dude, dude, yeah, please.  Let's really look.  Yeah, I know.  Wow.  I noticed this morning, yeah.  I'm not there yet, but I almost threw up on the board.  What's it going to take?  Do we have more bugs?  Oh, God.  Yeah, we want to get E-Rock puking today. 
[03:08:00]  I know.  What's on the board?  A mirror?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Wow, same joke several times.  You're right.  Sorry.  E-Rock, Jimmy noticed that you might have gained a few LBs.  Oh.  What's going on?  I actually didn't notice.  Why are you getting LBs again?  What happened?  How did you put on?  I didn't even notice.  I'm back to 210.  Fine.  What were you down to?  29.  When I, for that diet thing, I was at 195, but I'm at 210 again. 
[03:08:30]  Okay.  Geez.  What happened?  I don't know.  Food.  Food happened.  Well, look.  Look at, this is the beginning of one of the Doody videos, and it's visibly, I mean, you were...  You look a lot thinner than that.  A lot.  That is pretty funny that you were skinny, and then you watched someone eat shit, and that  inspired you to eat a lot.  You'd think it might have had the opposite.  Hey, can we put E-Rock on the scale?  I don't think he's 210, by the way.  I think he might be a little more than that. 
[03:09:00]  I bet you he's wearing those boxer briefs, and I'll be fucking goddamned if he doesn't  look good in boxer briefs.  By the way, E-Rock loves smelling fart boxes.  Does anyone have anything going on today in their pants?  No.  You?  Yeah.  What do you smell?  My asshole.  No.  Come on.  No.  Was it staying your asshole?  Probably.  I've had the same underwear on for a week.  Since the ass-smelling contest, which was already three days in, so that's eight days.  Because I have very poor hygiene and no money to buy new underwear. 
[03:09:30]  You have one pair of underwear?  I have four.  Do you put the other one on?  Four pairs of underwear.  Are you guys really questioning the underwear-wearing habits of a guy that just fucking snorted a  home?  You know, you're right.  You mean no dry-cleaning package?  Yeah, wait a minute.  Gerald, we should do it for Gerald, though.  I forgot.  He's fucking, he's a great comic.  He's doing a virus show.  Would you just sniff?  What do we got to do?  We love Gerald, though.  You just have to watch.  It's wonderful.  It's a wonderful sight.  Iraq, for the big studio audience.  It might not even stink.  Duffy's ass didn't stink last time. 
[03:10:00]  Iraq's looking for the garbage pill already.  You don't need it.  All right.  This is so gay.  It's not gay.  You get a rod and you get a...  All right.  You got to drop and ball.  Oh, Pat.  I think so.  Sure.  Sure.  Wow.  Get a good one.  Wow.  Is that what that is? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  Cool.  What?  What are we looking at?  We're identifying what could be the adult penis and balls.  Allegedly generous of a man.  Yes.  Well, now I just feel sheepish.  Sheepish?  Sorry, Pat.  It's all right.  All right.  Iraq.  All right.  So, Iraq.  You'll lose a few pounds here.  This is all...  You got to move the garbage can.  That's in everybody's way.  Yeah.  All right.  Just for all the work I've ever done for you.  All right.  That's fair.  Yeah.  You got to open the cheeks, Pat. 
[03:11:00]  What?  Communist?  Oh.  Oh, my God.  It's not gay.  Oh, yeah.  It's not gay.  It's gay not to right now.  All right.  Iraq.  Yeah.  Get down there.  It ain't good.  I can't even get near it.  I'm starting to heave.  It's delicious.  It's delicious.  Jimmy, make sure he does it right.  You got to get in there.  We want to smell the sniffing.  Sure.  I'll be happy to help out, Oop.  I always get the fucking great job.  Make sure his nose is near his asshole. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  Let's go.  My mic doesn't go any farther.  I was fucking happy.  Make sure you stay out of the way of that fucking thing or I kill.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  You get in there.  This is for Greg Jerome.  Iraq, you kneel down first.  Iraq kneels down first.  And this way, don't watch your knees.  It might be dirty.  And now you move back, Pat.  You can't touch him, but just bend forward.  Open your cheeks a little bit.  There you go.  Spread him up.  Come on. 
[03:12:00]  Iraq, get in there.  Don't be a silly.  Don't be shy.  This makes me incredibly happy.  I can't even tell you.  Open him up, Pat.  What are you fucking...  What are you, communist?  Iraq.  Get a good whiff, Iraq.  Get right in there.  Get in there.  You got to get in there and get a good whiff.  Get right in there.  Iraq's dizzy.  I can see it.  Let me look.  Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq.  Wow.  What a deep asshole.  Thanks.  Holy crow. 
[03:12:30]  We got to hear this.  Iraq, you haven't even done it yet.  Iraq, you haven't even done it yet.  You didn't do anything, Iraq.  Oh, God.  All right, get back in there.  Let's do it.  I got to say, I'm looking at...  Because I like a girl with a deep asshole.  I like that.  Yeah.  Yours is fucking awful, but what a fucking horrible deep crevice he has.  If you were a chick, I'd fucking marry you.  Literally, it's probably an entire hand-length deep before you get to the bum. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, shit.  Fucking deep.  Frack.  All right, spread them and let Iraq...  Come on, Iraq.  Iraq, get in there.  Get a good sniff.  Don't be a fag.  Stick your face in his ass.  Don't let it air out.  Don't let it air out too much.  Come on, sniff.  It's got to get that good...  Oh, boy.  Smell.  Jesus.  Get in there.  What are you doing, Eric?  You act like you're on a fucking big rod.  Here we go.  Got to get that good man-ass smell.  Here we go.  I can't get there.  Get in there.  Get in there. 
[03:13:30]  You can't get close.  You can't get in there.  That's just tasteless.  You can't get in there.  Come on, Iraq.  Get in there.  Come on, man.  I can't get near it.  I've seen a dude throw up before, but never for that reason.  Get that nose in there.  All right.  Here we go.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  What are you doing?  Oh, yes.  Holy fuck. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, my God.  He pushed his ass into his face.  Oh, my God.  He's got, like, a brown nose.  Oh.  No, what else is now?  Iraq, you all right?  How was it?  Oh, the eyeful.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, that is horrifying.  That's horrifying.  Smelled like gins.  Oh, God.  That puke sound is fantastic. 
[03:14:30]  Do you see, Kirk?  Not this time, no.  This was...  The other time, it was puckering and, like, moving.  This just smells horrible.  I can probably make this pucker if you want.  No.  All right.  That's Iraq, everyone.  Thank you, everyone.  Great.  Thank you, Kirk.  Hey, this is intern Pat Duffy, and you're listening to me desperately seek attention  on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:15:00]  And now, the worst black of Opie and Anthony.  This show sucks.  It's awful.  Well, Jim Jefferies admitted that he likes snowballing.  That is a fucking gay thing, man.  I don't like snowballing.  I just don't have a problem with it.  You've done it.  When you say you've snowballed...  I've done it.  I've done it many times.  What's the definition of snowballing for a second?  Kissing a fucking woman with your own...  After you come in her mouth, she kisses you with your cum in her mouth. 
[03:15:30]  That's not gay.  And you swap it.  That's snowballing.  No, no, no.  That's fucking gay.  I've done it with it.  You're going to say it's not gay, and Jefferies is not saying it.  Wow.  I've done it not even kissing where they've stood above me and spit it down my mouth.  That's not gay.  That's not gay.  That's gay.  Sometimes I like to humiliate.  That's like you come in your own mouth.  Would you do it with someone else's cum?  No, I wouldn't do it with someone else's cum.  That, to me, would be gay.  Someone else's cum would be gay.  I wouldn't do it with someone else's cum.  Have you ever gone down the girl where you've cum inside her and then gone down on her? 
[03:16:00]  No.  That's fucking despicable.  You ever eat your own boogers, but you wouldn't eat somebody else's?  First of all, you just tried to trick me by saying I did something that you didn't ask me about.  I said, did you ever eat your own boogers?  I didn't answer yet.  No.  But it's a speculative question.  I don't eat my own...  I never ate my own anything.  No.  You've never eaten your own anything.  If there's spit in my mouth, or if I...  I gotta spit it out.  Really?  I have to spit it out.  Oh, I don't.  No, no, I just swallow it backwards.  There you go.  But that comes from two snowballers.  We got a lot of reports coming in. 
[03:16:30]  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Snowballing is 100% gay.  No, it's not.  It's not gay.  It's like, I remember being like a 40-year-old boy and coming to my hand and looking at it.  Gay Jim's ill.  More importantly...  No, I think it's...  Because I don't know what it tastes like.  Hold on, we're out of something here.  More importantly, I want to ask Jim, how does it feel to meet your clone?  I never snowballed.  But you two are very similar.  The Australian doppelganger.  She's the same.  Fucking same thing.  Snowballing.  This is like the Australian version of Norton right here.  No, I don't...  I'm not saying you snowballed, but you guys have very similar tastes. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, but I prefer to have a circumcised cock.  It's like the Zara Norton.  Yeah.  But it's fucking...  I've done some filthy sexual things.  Snowballing to me was always just gross.  Like, my girlfriend has kissed me, like, after she's blown me.  Even pecking, there's a numbing...  It's horrible.  I've felched, man.  I'll put any...  Any...  He's into humiliation.  Any juicy pussy shit.  Hold on a second.  The guy just admitted that he's felched.  You suck cum out of a girl's ass you fucked?  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  You all cum.  Yeah, but I'm gay.  I'm gay.  I'm gay.  That is so gay.  I'm being wasted, man.  I'm just fucking...  And I'm not...  I'm only judging it because it's fucking gay.  Like, it's just a gay thing to do.  If you admit it...  Hold on.  How many millions of people...  Hold on.  My mom will never hear it.  She's just going to...  Nah.  You've got to walk us through the felching.  Like, give us some details.  Okay, what's so bad, all right?  You're already looking at where she shits from.  Why not add a bit of comment to the fucking game?  But first of all, see, the thing is about ass licking, the asshole... 
[03:18:00]  The anus is not where she...  The shit is in the lower intestines.  The asshole is...  Licking the asshole is a clean thing.  I'm going through like...  Come on.  Licking the asshole is a clean...  I don't mind licking the asshole.  It is not clean.  We live our whole lives...  We have a piss.  We go wash our hands with soap.  We do a shit.  There's shit smeared everywhere.  We dry it off with a bit of paper and go, that's clean enough for me.  Yeah.  And then we lick the fucking thing.  No. 
[03:18:30]  She takes a shower.  Well, we don't waste the paper.  For what?  If you take a shower, but felching do anything with your own cum...  No.  Oh, hold on.  Does felching, though?  Use any straws or anything?  No, no.  I'm not sick.  Would you lick...  I'm not crazy.  And it wasn't like I was going, and now, my dear, the felching begins.  It was just like, I've been fucking...  You break out of crazy straws.  I'm licking her cum again.  I go lick her ass a little bit.  There's a bit of cum, I'll lick it out.  Jim, if you came on her stomach, would you think it's gay to come on her stomach and  then lick it off her stomach? 
[03:19:00]  No.  I've never done that, but I wouldn't think it's gay.  Not gay.  Humiliation.  I've never done it.  Humiliation is different than gay.  Gay is wanting another man.  Someone's spitting your own...  No.  I'm telling you.  Somebody's spitting your own cum in your mouth, which to me is not my thing.  I've never done it.  I wouldn't do it.  You're getting the taste of a man's fucking product in your mouth, even though it's your  humiliation.  Yeah, but it's still the same chemical composition as any man's.  Have you ever come in your own hand and lick your cum out of your hand?  Yeah, before I had sex, I had done that because I wanted to know what it tastes like.  Jim is gay. 
[03:19:30]  Jim Jeffries is a sissy.  It's not like I ate it.  I just...  How many cocks do you take before you call it gay?  I bet you Simon Kyle's a sissy, too.  I have never touched a cock with my hands, but it's been like a spit roast where my cock  is rubbed against another man's cock.  He's gay.  Why won't anybody join me?  I don't think he is.  No, I'm not...  Jim is gay!  I'm not gay!  He's rubbed his dick on somebody. 
[03:20:00]  I've never done that.  I'm talking like...  Fucking a chick.  Yeah, it's a fucking a chick.  Like, if a girl's sucking two cocks at once, that's the most gay thing I've ever done.  That's absolutely gay because that is a fucking excuse to have your dick.  Just because the bitch's mouth is the receptacle...  But he was a friend of mine!  Somebody's dick...  Take the girl out of the mix and you're just rubbing dicks.  Yes!  Oh, yeah.  Take the girl...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, all the way...  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, let me just say this. 
[03:20:30]  Let me just say, before I forget, before I forget, what you just said, it makes a lot of  sense.  Oh, my God.  It's all the gayness is in context of a girl.  I'm going to lick my cum, I'm going to rub balls, I'm going to do all kind of juicy shit  with my own insides, but there's a bitch involved that makes it not gay.  Exactly, exactly.  It's a publicity stunt.  That's like saying having sex with a woman, if you take the woman away and put a man there,  it's fucking gay.  It is!  You can't just take people out of the equation.  A strap-on's not gay. 
[03:21:00]  Getting fucked with a strap-on's not gay.  It's absolutely...  No, it's not!  Crackity shit, are you out of your fucking mind?  No, it's not.  You've never had a girl strap a cock on and fuck you up the arm.  No, not even ever.  And she's wanking you.  I've never even had a bitch go fingernail deep in my ass.  Oh, my God.  Patrice, hold on, I was with Patrice until then, but when we start talking about the  strap-ons, these phones will fucking light up with guys that say that it's not gay and  that they've done it many times.  It's not.  It's amazing.  I've never done it.  I didn't know that. 
[03:21:30]  Why isn't a fucking woman with a virtual dick in your ass hole not gay?  I've done it right up and down a bar.  What makes it gay is if the strap-on looks like a cock.  If it looks like anything else, then it's not gay.  No, it's humiliation.  It's all about a woman.  Do you believe that, Elby?  If it's a strap-on giraffe or something, it's not gay.  If it looks like a fist.  Right.  If it looks like a fist.  A girl's fist.  A girl's fist.  I mean, a girl sits on your face and doesn't make you a chair.  If it's like a fist and it's got an engagement ring. 
[03:22:00]  But if you're getting a strap-on, if a girl puts a strap-on, if a girl puts on a strap-on  and fucks you in the ass.  It humiliates you.  No.  I'll tell you what.  No.  Dude, I almost had it.  I couldn't go through it.  It's not humiliation.  I had a girl one time, a dominatrix one time, doing it to me, and she was staring me in  the face.  She was fucking staring me in the face.  And called you a faggot.  No.  I couldn't do it because it hurt.  But it was about this woman with these beautiful tits being so perverse. 
[03:22:30]  I didn't think, wow, I wish that was a guy's cop.  It was nothing to do with it.  It was her.  She turned me on.  However you rationalize it.  But I didn't do it because it hurt.  Okay.  If any girls out there that would like to date a guy that does all the things that I do,  please, please email us.  Or any men that want to date him, please.  Yeah.  He's a fag.  I want to go backwards a little bit because you said, you know, it was a friend of yours.  So immediately I was thinking of Anthony and I'm like, oh, Jesus.  No, no, no.  Here we are.  Here we are.  Here we are.  We're not close.  He doesn't call me. 
[03:23:00]  He wasn't there.  Anthony, trust me.  We're on the same page.  So we're friends.  Could you imagine we have...  No.  Thank you.  No.  Thank you.  Don't even say it.  One girl's mouth.  One girl's sucking both our cocks.  And both of you, first of all, even being around another motherfucker.  Okay.  Take the sexuality out of it.  Your dick is just in the vicinity of my dick.  Yeah.  That's why...  That's the problem I have with swinging.  The one thing is just the... 
[03:23:30]  If we swing and swap, it's the dick.  Get your dick out of here.  You take the dick out of it.  Only women like anything that has to do with a dick.  Men shouldn't like anything that has to do with a dick.  And I'm not even being a fucking homophobe.  I'm just saying, dicks are not a pleasurable looking thing.  Well, you grab your own dick.  What's the difference?  Yeah.  Put that on another guy.  It's masturbating.  It's masturbating.  Why?  You just a man's hand on your cock.  You jerk off.  You're giving sexual pleasure to a cock. 
[03:24:00]  Look, if you can convince me jerking off is gay...  But I'm saying that's gay.  You're gay.  Because I jerk off.  With your big manly hand on your...  I jerk off.  On your feminine cock.  I don't think that's being gay, but if you can tell me that's being...  I'm not going to...  Put it this way.  I'm not going to stop saying felching and snowballing is gay.  If jerking off is gay, then we are all gay.  But you're also gayer.  No.  You can't be gayer.  You're either gay or you can't be gayer.  There's no one.  Well, you could be gayer. 
[03:24:30]  Jerking off is gay.  You're sloppy party bottom.  Felching is super gay.  Jerking off is not gay.  All right.  Do you have a...  Do you have a girl put a finger up your arm?  Who hasn't?  No.  She gave it a try.  Didn't like it.  Okay.  Not a fan of that.  You're the most heterosexual man in the world.  Or you don't have a prostate gland.  No.  No.  I just...  It's just...  You know what it is?  It's just the penetration.  It just feels funny.  Like, you know what?  This should not be happening in my ass.  All right.  What about if you fuck a girl in the ass?  It's a violation.  You fuck a girl in the ass.  It's just a strange thing. 
[03:25:00]  You fuck a girl in the ass.  That would be gay by your definition.  No.  Because there's an ass in that.  I enjoy woman ass fucking.  I enjoy woman ass asses.  No, no.  Men and women both have asses.  You know.  So you're fucking a woman's ass.  It's not like she's got a cock too.  And she's used to being the fucky.  Women...  Everything about a woman is going inside her mouth or her asshole or ears.  Yeah.  So the second something's going inside you, you are taking on the feminine role.  So you're saying you can argue that everything's...  If something goes inside you, you're taking on the feminine role.  How about guys that get tied up and trampled and stepped on? 
[03:25:30]  It's all about humiliation.  That's humiliation.  I'll give you that.  All of it is.  You're saying normally my sex is pretty standard.  They're humiliated gay men.  These are isolated incidences.  These are isolated incidences.  You're saying his sex is pretty standard.  These are isolated incidences.  Like this isn't like Tuesday.  Every day, right.  You're fucking sucking come out of your ass.  Sometimes the sex is relatively normal.  A punch here, a slap here, a cut.  Is this a bunch of people on here, Opie, who fucking enjoy felching? 
[03:26:00]  No, no.  Well, there's still...  Bones are lit though.  I'll tell you that.  We'll go through those in a second.  There's a song by King Missal that'll solve the argument someone is saying.  Have you ever heard, Ant, um, gay...  Where is it?  God damn it.  A King Missal song called Gay Not Gay.  Someone is saying if you play this song, it'll solve the argument.  I'm sure that's a fucking band member writing it.  Yeah, because rock bands, they have all the answers.  Exactly.  All right.  Well, let's go to this guy.  We're going to...  You know, we do play... 
[03:26:30]  You know what?  This is perfect.  We do play a game on this show called Gay or Funny.  Or gay...  We can change it to gay or not gay.  Yeah, fine.  All right?  Because people now have things that they're calling up about.  Fucking trannies isn't gay.  All right, let's go to...  No, no.  Fucking trannies is gay.  Let's go to...  No, it's not.  No, no.  If you used to be a man, if there's a cock involved...  That's amazing that you were saying that.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Because he's like, listen, I suck my own cum out of a bitch's ass, but this whole tranny  thing...  That tranny thing.  And I happen to agree with you that fucking a fucking man... 
[03:27:00]  Oh, I agree completely.  There's a baby who thinks he's a woman, but he has a dick, but you've qualified him as  a woman.  Oh, stop with all your double-talking.  Yeah, you can...  No, no, no.  It's fat.  It's because you put tits on a thing.  It's fat.  You can put your pig onto the river.  Oh, cut it out.  All right, let's go.  Oh, come on.  Leave it to Beaver.  We're playing gay or not gay, gay or funny.  Right now, we start with Jess in Chicago. 
[03:27:30]  Jess.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Even my fucking girl thinks taking cum in the mouth is fucking gay.  I fucking came in her mouth on accident.  She fucking swipes it out of her mouth and slaps me in the face with it.  It's not a good fucking relationship.  Good luck.  Shame on you.  It sucks.  You pay for her...  Shame on you for tolerating that shit.  Yeah, right?  Swallow it.  Slaw it.  Walk home.  Slap her back.  What a fucking...  This girl's not slapping me with my cum.  So gay...  They're spitting it on me.  There's a vastly different situation. 
[03:28:00]  That's not gay because you didn't see the handful of cum, you know...  How do you accidentally cum in the girl's mouth?  No, I'm going to go...  Exactly.  I'm going to go...  And then she go...  Yeah.  Jess was gay.  Your name's girly.  You're fucking gay.  Next.  All right.  Glenn the trucker.  Glenn.  Hey, everybody jacks off, right?  Yes, sir.  But if you could suck your own dick, wouldn't you swallow your load?  No.  No.  No, I would suck my own dick, but I wouldn't swallow my load.  I wouldn't suck my own dick.  So what, you'd stop sucking and beat it off then?  Well, here's what's hilarious. 
[03:28:30]  I beat off the end, cover my face a little bit, like I do with girls.  I don't want them to cum in their mouths.  The guy on the phone...  I just jack in my face and then look in the mirror and say, you're a nasty girl.  The guy on the phone says, it sounds like he really, he didn't even, he didn't even assume for five seconds that no, some of us won't suck our own dick if we could.  Right.  I'd suck my own dick, man.  Of course I would.  Like, he goes, you'll suck your own dick, right?  No, I wouldn't suck my own dick.  You'd say you wouldn't suck your own dick if you could, you're a liar.  Okay, I'm a liar, you fucking dickhead.  I'm not lying.  I wouldn't suck my own dick.  You wouldn't suck, you would not suck your own dick if you could. 
[03:29:00]  No.  But you'll beat it off.  That's gay.  You'll beat it off.  Why is that gay, Jim Jeffries?  Because you're oppressing yourself.  A dick is in your mouth.  Just because it's your dick doesn't make it not a dick.  No.  It's a dick in your mouth.  No, it's your dick.  Your dick.  Which is a dick.  That's the same as saying, if you put your hand on it, you wouldn't put a man's hand.  What's the difference?  What's the difference?  It's your hand.  Do you like your nipples licks?  It's a man's hand.  Do you like your nipples licks?  No, I'm too busy swallowing cum for that.  I like my nipples licked, but I've never lifted up to lick my own nipples. 
[03:29:30]  That's gay.  Ah, there you go.  You think that's gay?  You lick your own nipples?  No, because it wouldn't turn me on to do so.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  You're sucking your own dick.  I don't get nipple play, man.  Like, Jimmy loves that.  Do you love your nipples when you jerk them off?  Dude, I can't jerk off unless there's a woman licking my nipples.  There's not a bitch around licking my nipples.  It's not even a feeling.  It's watching a girl with her tongue out licking my nipples.  If I had to pinch your nipples right now, is that gay? 
[03:30:00]  Yes.  Yeah, a little bit.  Oh, no, well, the context.  If it's just fucking him, you playing.  You keep your homosexuality to yourself, Jim Jeffers.  I just like this.  Jim, man.  Jim, if he's being honest.  Jim, I really don't want to do that.  I really don't want to do that.  This is what I've studied.  Jim is a sissy.  I don't think he's gay.  Maybe not a sissy, but he's definitely a pofter.  A pofter.  He's got fucking shame.  He's a fucking, he's filled with shame.  And fucking, that's a shame thing. 
[03:30:30]  He should be because he eats cum out of women.  He should be filled with shame.  I don't eat other men's cum.  There might be some residue from the night before.  But mostly standard.  It's my cum.  Mostly yours.  During the spit roast, there wasn't two loads of cum.  I didn't felch during the spit roast.  It's not gay if you don't know you're eating another man's cum.  I don't know.  I don't know about that.  If you don't know.  In God's eyes, it's gay.  Yeah, yeah.  You know when you're...  Let's say hi to God.  Don't touch your own cock, you queer.  I just want to know one thing. 
[03:31:00]  What about felching is normal, but adding a straw to it makes it weird?  No, no, no, no.  I just don't like...  Because it's just in the moment.  If you just go down there and look at God's eyes in the moment.  If I have a straw ready...  That makes it a little silly.  It makes it a little bit...  You know, a spoon.  I would give you a spoon.  A teaspoon.  Yeah.  Let's see how to Eric and Brooklyn.  Then heat it up like heroin and shoot it into my veins.  Brooklyn.  What's up, Eric?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Listen, for the past hour, I've been hearing nothing but cum and dick. 
[03:31:30]  You guys are all fucking fairies.  I guess we're all gay.  Yeah, hey, I'm fucking fairies.  You gotta cover this.  All right.  I wish that would turn me on.  Because I'm such a fucking pervert.  A girl spit my own cum in my mouth.  I would love to have a new avenue to go down.  Really?  It just doesn't do anything for...  I don't want to lick her pussy after I fuck her.  It's not a major thing for me.  I'm just saying I've done it a couple of times.  It's not one of my things.  You do know you guys need to hang out, right?  I don't want to...  Not for the sex...  Not to have sex with each other, but you guys have a lot of time.  No, probably not.  I do know that my agent was considering me being a support for you, too. 
[03:32:00]  I think this could be a marriage made in heaven.  I have gotten to very disgusting areas sexually.  Very.  How far have you gone?  What's the worst?  Well, what's the worst that you can think of?  I'm just swallowing cum out of girls' ass.  Okay, look.  Look.  Jimmy's willing to play, but he's going about this slowly.  Just curious.  He's not tipping his hand here.  I'm not tipping his hand.  He's not going all in yet.  Okay, I've had...  We've got two poker faces going on here.  I've already told you.  I've had my cock touching another man's cock shoved into a girl's mouth 
[03:32:30]  while making her say that she's a slut with two cocks in her mouth  so that she mumbles it.  That's about as bad as I've really...  And I've eaten my own cum out of a girl's asshole.  That's nasty.  Anything else you want to put on the table?  I'm trying to think of something else that would be...  Oh, there's a girl that used to like to be cut.  But that wasn't me.  That's what she was into.  And just little razors that you cut up coke with  and just slashing her shoulder blades as you...  Holy fuck.  That's the worst I've got.  That wasn't me.  I don't like doing that.  It's not gay.  That's not gay.  All right, Jimmy.  No, but that doesn't make him a Puerto Rican.  Jimmy, you asked... 
[03:33:00]  Now, Jimmy, you asked Jim Jeffries...  I like it.  I should have got more.  I didn't hear you.  That's all right.  Are you...  You want a counter now or...  I've never had my own cum in my mouth.  Not my thing.  Pissed, would you do piss?  I've pissed on a girl, yeah.  Let's probably stay with it.  Would you let it go piss in your mouth?  No, I would not let it go piss in my mouth.  That's just hygiene problems that I have.  It's a personal thing.  Not a bad thing.  I wouldn't...  I wouldn't have a...  I don't have a problem with it.  Would you take a load on your chest?  Yes.  No.  No, no shit.  No shit.  No one shit, Jimmy. 
[03:33:30]  Yes.  No shit.  It's not going to happen.  I don't have a problem with it.  I've watched the porn.  I watched Two Girls, One Cup with you guys.  Enjoyed it.  Had a good time.  But no, no shit.  He's going to be involved with me.  Like, Two Girls, One Cup just didn't bother me.  That made me laugh, really.  That made me dry wretch, Two Girls, One Cup.  Now, when you talk about being a creep, Two Girls, One Cup turned me on because of watching  Two Beautiful Girls just be that cruddy.  I don't need them being cruddy with me.  You know what I mean?  So if the girls are being disgusting, it's something sexy about girls just doing dirty shit. 
[03:34:00]  What bugged me about that was the shit and the puke were slick.  If it's a solid log, I could have enjoyed it.  But the fact that they were chewing it up, that to me is incomprehensibly gross.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It just was just, it was kind of sexy to me.  They have fathers as well that would have had to watch that.  Although, it's saying that, I just hope my mom's not listening to this show.  We're going to go to Teresa from New York.  She's just amazed by the last hour.  Teresa, what's up?  What do you got?  I think this is, do you guys talk like this like when you go to bars? 
[03:34:30]  We talk worse on the radio.  We're playing it down because the public can hear.  Yeah, this is the beauty of it.  Imagine when me and Norton are alone.  Oh, my God.  You guys are the most sexually honest people I've ever heard in my whole life.  It is just amazing what I'm listening to.  It is unbelievable.  I love it.  You haven't been fished?  Yeah, Teresa, what's the craziest thing you have done?  Oh, Christ.  I knew this was going to turn to me somehow.  Well, it's all right.  I'm really, really, really very plain.  I'm sorry. 
[03:35:00]  I have nothing for the show.  Have you done anything?  There's no fingers going anywhere crazy.  Wait, sweetheart.  Have you ever had a guy ask you to do something that you thought might be a little gay?  Gay on his part?  Yeah, like you're like, I don't want to do that.  I don't want to put a finger in his ass or whatever.  No, actually, it's gone the other way.  Like, I've tried it and it's never worked out.  Okay, if I had come out of your ass, would you consider me to be a gay?  You know what?  In the moment, I don't think you would.  Yeah.  I don't think the girl would because it's just some old, it's some like dirty, like treating  a man like how you treat them because they're the fuckies. 
[03:35:30]  So anytime you can.  Exactly.  So once, if you get a chance to turn it around, you want to use every chance you can.  Wow.  And hold it against them, too, to make him less sexy.  Exactly.  And talk about it to all their friends.  Exactly.  So he can get shoes.  Exactly.  So she can call you a fucking cum-eating asshole.  Exactly.  And call all his friends up.  Tell all his friends what he did.  Wow.  You like that, don't you, faggot?  See, the thing is, with me, you can tell them my friends.  My friends already know.  It's like eight million people listening to this or something.  They already know.  What's the big deal? 
[03:36:00]  One of my favorite.  You know what?  You can't disgrace me.  Teresa, thank you.  One of my favorite clips was brought in by Patrice, Gavin.  Yeah.  Do we have that?  For Jim Jefferies?  Oh, is that great?  Holy.  Can you set this up, Patrice, for everybody?  Not really.  You don't remember?  I wasn't here when he did it.  Okay.  Gavin is one of our friends that Patrice introduced us to.  He's real good friends with Patrice.  From England, by the way.  From England.  He was in a hotel room with a hooker, I believe.  The hooker strapped it on and did Gavin's friend in the ass while Gavin filmed the whole 
[03:36:30]  thing on a cell phone.  And laughed.  And laughed all the way through it.  And his friend is getting it.  Gavin who?  I'm not knowing.  Gavin.  No.  He's as big as that doorway.  Gavin the cloud.  He's on a love boat.  Just a big...  And I thought that was gay at the time.  Like, and it was...  Oh, the guy...  And even Gavin just sitting there with the fucking camera taping it.  And laughing.  And listening to this guy get mashed in his asshole.  It's just...  I'm like, this is...  Because he's in such pain.  See, you know, maybe you go, like, way too far thinking things are gay just because 
[03:37:00]  they have anything to do with something as opposed to what...  Because gay men kiss.  I think fucking fat chicks is gay.  Right.  Can I say that?  I'm not saying this like naughty, naughty, you're gay.  I'm just saying it's gay.  Can we be friends?  And there might be some things I do and I go...  When Gavin set this thing up, I was thinking, wow, Gavin is gay.  And I'm certainly not going to tell him because he's about 6'6", 300 pounds.  And he's the least gay dude I know.  Yeah, not enough to fat on him.  And then we played this thing on the radio.  I'm like, it's not gay. 
[03:37:30]  The guy just made something not gay.  Listen, we don't have the video.  He just gave us the audio.  The audio is really good, though.  Listen to this.  We got it, Danny?  Yeah, but you guys are talking over it.  We are?  Yeah, I have it.  It's just with you guys laughing and talking and stuff over it, though.  All right, well, this is the only version we got?  I thought we had a clean version.  Yeah, I mean, I think Eric says that we should have it.  So if you want to just give it a minute, he might be able to dig it up somewhere. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, you rock.  And I thought that was, you know, he's laughing and this and that.  I'm like, this is so gay.  But I'm not saying it like, hey, stay away from me, you fags.  It's just like I go, ass, look at your own cunt.  It's like, that's gay.  But it's not like I give a fuck.  It's not like we're less friends.  We're still defining this game.  We got sucking your own dick stuff.  Tom at Alabama, yes.  Tom, let's go.  Hey, what's up?  It's Brian.  Hey, yeah. 
[03:38:30]  A girlfriend that I've been able to suck my own dick found out when I was 12.  So it was like heaven.  But it is overrated because you can't enjoy it as much while you're giving it to yourself and receiving.  But I had a girlfriend.  Whenever we were fucking, I'd pull it out, put it in my mouth, lick her pussy juice off my dick and put it back in.  And she loved that and told all her friends about it.  So after we broke up, one of her friends out of the club knew I could do that, asked me that.  She said, I heard you can lick my clit while you're fucking me. 
[03:39:00]  I was like, yeah.  So she went home from the club with me.  So that makes it negatively gay.  That's pretty funny.  Right?  Like, lick her clit while you're fucking.  You can lick her clit while you're fucking.  That's just like a magic trick.  You can't do that.  You can suck your own cock.  Or Jeremy can suck his own cock.  But you can't anymore.  Do you know why sucking your own dick is gay?  For the fact that, how do you approach sucking your own dick?  You try.  You try.  Like how a fucking bitch would suck your dick. 
[03:39:30]  Do you suck your dick well?  Or you suck it like a dude who's not gay?  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Do you suck dick well when you suck your own dick?  Are you doing a good job?  Do you twirl the tongue?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you really like.  Or do you let spit come out?  You're fucking sissy.  Are you giving yourself a good one?  If you suck your own dick.  Or are you giving yourself a bad blowjob?  Are you giving.  Exactly.  Are you.  You're fucking.  Are you sucking it just to put your mouth on it?  Why is jerking off okay?  It's just for.  Yeah, it's just.  You know what?  I just realized. 
[03:40:00]  Jerking off.  Is gay.  Is for pleasure.  You want to cum.  Sucking your own dick is for pleasure.  But the thing is.  Jerking your dick is like.  There's a.  There's really a.  It's no pleasure.  You're trying to get to an end.  So it's really.  You don't get out of pussy.  You suck your dick in and stop.  And you're pretending that it's a puss on your.  And you're looking and you're just jerking your fucking dick.  It's.  But.  Patrice makes a good point here.  If you suck your own dick.  You're thinking of a girl's mouth.  Wait a minute.  Do you suck it. 
[03:40:30]  Like you're jerking it off.  Like.  Hey.  I'm just going to suck it.  Just.  Yeah.  Just.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You got to keep your eyes closed.  And maybe cry a little.  Are you doing it for pleasure?  You're sucking your dick.  And you make sounds.  Mm.  Like a bitch.  You're sucking your dick like a bitch.  Or like a dude who's jerking off.  When you jerk off.  No.  You're sucking your dick like a dude who's jerking off.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  When you jerk off.  Do you do it like a girl would jerk you off?  Are you trying to.  Be sensuous with your own cock?  No.  No.  Or are you just pounding your meat?  How much do you hate a bitch trying to jerk you off? 
[03:41:00]  It's.  It's senseless.  When they try to jerk you off and it's just like.  It's like.  Let me do it.  The second I'm ready to come you grab it and fucking just do the last couple of strokes.  And we'll give you the credit.  What?  You take the credit.  How do you create.  You get the collar.  It's kind of like going fishing with your dad.  He caught the fish and then you reel it in.  How do you.  How do you.  How do you.  That's how you deal with girls jerking off.  How do you create a style to suck your own dick?  We can't do it.  That's why it sounds so crazy and none of us can do it.  If we could do it.  These guys.  We can't answer it though.  The rarity.  For us it's foreign because it's such a rarity. 
[03:41:30]  But if you could.  Would you do it well?  If I could.  13 years old.  12 years old.  If you said to somebody.  Will you jerk off?  They'd probably go no.  I wouldn't.  When you're a kid you never want to admit you jerk off.  No.  Or that you would.  It's incomprehensible.  Well as adults that's still the way dick sucking is to us because we never learn to do it.  Patrice.  Very famous story on this show.  My brother sucked his own dick as a kid.  And he's not gay.  He's not a gay dude.  And he explained it this way.  He goes I wanted to get one.  I didn't want to give one. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  That's a good point.  You do it for pleasure.  When you jerk off are you thinking wow I got a big dick in my.  No.  You're going oh this feels good.  Boy this one's a lovely one.  The feeling of the cock in your hand.  The feeling of the cock in your hand is overridden by the feeling of being jerked.  So I'm imagining being soft.  Let me tell you something.  When I jerk my dick I don't even pay attention to my dick.  Right.  My hand and my dick are inconsequential to the fact that I'm looking at something or thinking  about something and jerking off.  But the act of sucking your own dick there's no thought. 
[03:42:30]  You are sucking your own dick.  But we can't do it.  Sometimes I put love beads up my ass while I wank.  Is that gay?  And then yank them off just as I'm coming.  No.  We must have as you're gay Jim.  You're already out of the picture man.  David in Tennessee what's up?  Hey fellas what's going on?  The great Ron Jeremy says sucking your own dick feels incredibly good.  Right up to the point you realize you have a dick in your mouth.  Well Ron does a lot of funny things.  Hey if I can make an observation here. 
[03:43:00]  What's that?  I have no idea.  You're listening on hold.  Everyone wants to listen.  Sound like sound.  It's so much different than on the radio.  Fly on the wall is amazing just to hear it on hold.  Why?  What's the difference?  What's the difference?  I don't know.  You feel like you're listening in on something you're not supposed to listen into.  It's a weird.  You can ask it on the phone.  You get a little teehee.  Yeah it's cool.  All right David.  By the way I wanted to make an announcement.  We're starting to get the lineups together for the O&H Halloween Virus Comedy Show. 
[03:43:30]  And of course you know.  You know.  I would love to.  We're going to see if we can get you guys.  We'll call it a tour.  Your name came up a lot yesterday Jim Jefferies.  Oh thank you.  And of course Patrice.  I mean that doesn't have to be said.  But we're starting to get the lineups together.  We can do a double like me and you called Gay Not Gay.  Yeah we can just perform on the same mic.  Right.  All right.  Oh we got Gavin's audio.  Clean.  So listen to this. 
[03:44:00]  So once again this is Gavin our friend.  Filming his buddy getting a strap on up his ass.  From a hooker in a hotel room.  They're all together.  We've got a sweet last one.  No no.  I'm not a shit.  Oh my god.  Maybe I'm not.  No we don't know a bit.  That's a little bit more.  That's it.  That's it.  There you go.  Wow.  It's like being fucked up in the house.  In your bum hole.  In your bum hole.  Shit.  The camera's not filmed. 
[03:44:30]  I don't know.  That's fine.  Hang on.  That's it Dan.  Why don't you fuck.  Hang on.  Let me just get a sponsor.  OK so we've got Warren in the job and Mrs. Guilford.  Do you want one?  And Lloyd is just going to get involved there.  Let me just get this one.  Quick look mate. 
[03:45:00]  I've got a bit smaller sound.  Where's that small?  That's it.  That's it.  I don't even want to go with this shit one.  What's going on?  What do you mean fucking pussy?  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  What's the matter?  Oh my fucking god.  Is it nice?  Come on.  Why is it nice in the earth?  It's like my fucking eyes.  Oh my god. 
[03:45:30]  Ah.  Ah.  Oh my god.  Fuck it off.  Oh my god.  What the fuck.  What the fuck.  What the fuck.  What the fuck.  What the fuck.  What the fuck.  Yeah.  Oh look at the light.  You can see there.  Give me a towel.  Because if he's covered in shit.  I don't want to.  You can see him.  Give me a towel.  Bye.  Oh shit.  I'll see you then.  I'll see you then.  Oh. 
[03:46:00]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh god.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  Well, when you get in there, fuck, I'm out of your idea.  It's a lot more fun.  Get in there and give it a good ride, it's just. 
[03:46:30]  No, come on, because I don't want to touch too much.  Oh.  Oh.  There we go.  Get in there later.  Get in there later.  Good lad, good lad later.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what I'm talking about.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:47:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, fucking hell.  There was a moment where I started to get an erection.  I'm not kidding you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's okay.  That bitch going, I got shit all over me, get a towel.  I was like, that's fucking hot, mate.  He's shit all over a strap on dildo. 
[03:47:30]  Patree's under his breath.  What's wrong, Patree?  He's calling Jimmy a piece of shit.  Why?  Because it smells, but that's the way the fucking room probably smelled.  This is like a thing in the future.  Oh, oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Smell a radio.  Yeah.  Like scratching stiff.  Oh, fucking.  Fucking Gavin laughing to the whole thing.  Just killing it.  Oh.  Oh.  That's what I'm talking about.  Is that McCain's wife in the red?  Yeah.  Huh?  Fucking hot broad.  Yeah, McCain's wife's all right.  She's like Annie Pollard.  Old broad. 
[03:48:00]  Fuck, man.  Jeez.  Look at this little Halle Berry fucking...  Fucking hell.  Oh.  What is she...  You want to do?  Hey, let's...  That's great.  Listen to this orgasm.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  There's just something in his ass.  How would you like to come like that?  Can you do something in his ass?  Could you play the famous one? 
[03:48:30]  Where it was Guess the Sound?  I don't want to give it away.  Oh, right, right, right.  With the yee-ha guy.  Yeah, I have it?  I think so.  Here's Tom Sizemore from his porno movie that he did.  Oh!  Oh!  Mother...  Fuck!  And here's a little Asian woman getting shit on.  That should be the national anthem. 
[03:49:00]  God, I fucking love it.  The unhappier the girl is, the fucking happier the girl is.  Oh, yeah.  The Japanese are mental when it comes to...  Oh, yeah.  They're sick.  I'm telling you.  I watch it.  They pixelate the cock, but they don't pixelate the shit.  No, the pubic hair.  Only the pubic hair.  Yeah, and the dog's cock is fine to have in there.  You know, it's horrible stuff.  It's all rape, and it's all tying up in...  Pedophilia, yeah.  It's all dressed like school kids and stuff.  It's a fucking horrible...  It's a World War losing thing, I'm telling you, because Germany is the same way. 
[03:49:30]  It's got something to do when your country concedes a World War.  The whole fucking psyche of the nation goes down.  Yeah, well, yeah, that makes perfect sense.  No, the porn in Japan is fucking...  Even I go, it's fucking sick, man.  It's just shit coming out on her.  You hear crackling.  Yeah, you hear the crackling of the pudding.  Do you guys want to...  Of the sausage?  That fucking chocolate mousse crackle.  Hey, you're listening to Opie and Anthony, and if you're not listening to him, you might  be deaf or retarded and just have the radio on and just be looking at it, staring, and 
[03:50:00]  nothing's really computing in.  But you wouldn't be offended by this.  You can't hear me either.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, let me unzip.  I'm kind of suspicious, because your relationship ended just in time for prom season.  What's that about?  Well, you know, I like getting in a limo.  I like a nice limo ride.  Dude, please go to a prom this year.  You want me to go to a prom? 
[03:50:30]  Please go to a prom.  There's got to be one 17-year-old girl out there that needs a prom date.  What girl wants to go to prom?  I'll take it to prom.  That'd be a start.  It's a hacky radio bit.  I'll just go to prom.  But please.  It wouldn't be a radio bit.  That's what I'm saying.  That's why we would actually think about doing it.  How horrible would that be?  The father beats me up because I'm fucking pounding his girl in the backseat.  On tomorrow's...  That's awful.  Tomorrow's show, we're going to have potential dates call you. 
[03:51:00]  Only a prom date, though.  We're not looking for any other...  That's a prom date.  Hi, Anthony.  I don't have a date for the prom.  You'll take care of all that on your own.  We're looking for a prom date for you, though.  A prom date?  I bet you there's one or two listeners that would actually do this.  Yeah.  But they have to put out.  They have to put out.  In the ass.  Yeah, you have to open up your ass for it.  There's no putting out.  That's right.  You've got to give Anthony a stinky mushroom.  That's fucking like...  You've got to give up the brown eye for Anthony if you want to have him. 
[03:51:30]  You've got to let him shoot potato flakes in your right hand.  You love the Cheerio and ride the tailpipe.  Fucking tailpipe.  That's all.  You've got to let him grab a potato flakes in your tailpipe.  Pull it out.  Put potato flakes all over your rink knuckle.  Stink wrinkle.  Rink knuckle?  Whatever.  No, he called it the...  A rink knuckle.  Yeah, he called it the stink knuckle.  Stink wrinkle.  The asshole is the tailpipe.  Potato flakes is...  Yeah, your dried cum. 
[03:52:00]  He's the worst, man.  I love that guy.  I love him.  He had a million of them.  Sewer.  Oh, I can't remember.  We have to...  We said in the past, we've got to get a montage of all those.  Just throw them together.  You've got to give Anthony a rusty trombone with Chuck Mangione playing in the background.  Yeah.  And accurately play it.  Dude, I think there would actually be a girl that we'll call tomorrow and see if you're  serious about this prom thing.  Would you do it?  Yeah, I would go to the... 
[03:52:30]  What if we made it 18 so you don't get arrested?  So there's some girls that are already 18.  17 in New York, according to...  Legal?  Well, according to ageofconsent.com.  Oh, my God.  That's how you know you're a piece of shit if you have that bookmark.  If you have that...  Yeah, right?  Let me just...  That's your homepage.  So we got our animation contest, and now we got the Open Up Your Ass for Anthony contest, 
[03:53:00]  which we'll start tomorrow.  Open up.  It's time.  16 in New Jersey for anybody who has a jersey prom.  How do you know this?  It was a bit I was doing.  Oh, okay.  You were researching a bit.  I was researching a bit.  Yeah.  It's called Living as a Pederset.  That's it.  Yeah, and Pete Townsend was researching a book.  All right.  We got lots of contests to do tomorrow.  Open up your ass for Anthony, and we got to start talking about our animation festival. 
[03:53:30]  Animation Palooza, I think it's called.  Yes.  I like animation.  Well, animation festival is going to be the...  Anima...  That's going to be the working...  Anima Palooza.  I don't know.  Animation festival is going to be the...  Cartoon Palooza.  That was it.  It's going to be the working name.  Yeah.  It's not going to be the official name.  Cartoon Palooza.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You have to go to a prom.  You have to.  Oh, my God.  And this is what it is.  Girls got to be legal, depending on what state that you go to the prom, and she has to put  out a little. 
[03:54:00]  Just a little.  What is that?  Like, you get to, like, squeeze her little boobie.  And I'm going to be squeezing any boobie.  You have to squeeze her little boobie.  How horrible is it for a...  And you don't even have to go under her dress or anything.  Just on the outside.  Like, let's negotiate with these girls.  But I have to come over, though, and as the parents have taken pictures, I got a pin  of corsage on her.  Yes.  But she has to agree that later on in the night, when Mommy and Daddy are gone, you get  to squeeze her boobie a little bit.  Yeah.  And maybe touch the top of Patch. 
[03:54:30]  I can't touch the top of Patch.  Well, we got to negotiate.  It doesn't work like that.  I guarantee we'll find a girl that is dead serious about taking you to their prom.  There's something called date rape.  If not, if she agrees.  Yeah, even if she agrees.  If she doesn't want to, it's date rape.  You don't want to get into there, do you?  Hey, what are you, a mind reader?  Oh, I guess we found a subject that Dan's ready to talk about. 
[03:55:00]  Jesus Christ.  We've been throwing lobs at you all day.  You finally hit one back.  All right, Dan.  Let's get into this a little bit.  Lord Shirehorst says.  Isn't it Horst?  We forgot that guy's name right, Jimmy.  Lord Shirehorst.  Shirehorst.  Says there's a girl available for the Daddy Daughter Dance if anyone is interested.  Daddy Daughter Dance.  How about she has to touch your giant hog through your tuxedo? 
[03:55:30]  No.  No.  Why?  Oh, God.  Just helping a brother out here.  Pretty embarrassing.  Tim W. from Rochester, the home of Brother Weez, always will be.  He writes, Anthony prom equals pink sock hop.  All right, we've got so much to talk about and think about for tomorrow's show. 
[03:56:00]  Open up your Ask for Anthony contest.  It starts tomorrow officially.  I don't think.  I'm just going to go off on a limb here and say I don't think we're really going to get many contestants  if that's the name of the contest.  Huh?  I don't think we're going to get a lot of takers.  Because if it's a prom thing, then you're talking, you know, girl with the parents and  if it's open up your ass.  Jimmy, do you have a problem with the name of the contest? 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, I think it should be open up your asshole.  I think open up your ass is too vague.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Too much.  Too fucking much.  You really have a problem with the name?  That's weird.  Well, and Voss must have a daughter that's doing the prom this year.  Yes.  I spent some time talking with the Voss daughters at one of the...  That was the most uncomfortable thing I've ever experienced. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, was Rich just infuriated?  He was so pissed.  I got her phone number and Rich just was funny.  He wanted to punch me.  He wanted to punch me in the head.  Like I wasn't ever going to use it.  But it was just funny because I knew it annoyed the shit out of Rich.  I was offering her drinks.  I was offering her booths.  There was a bit of realism there.  I was standing right there.  I was like...  He's just talking.  Hey, by the way, yes, I'm sorry, Shay, and to everybody else that have been with us a 
[03:57:30]  long time.  Shay from Connecticut writes, come on, Ann.  Remember how much better everything is when you put teen in front of it.  So it really should be open up your teen ass.  Hole.  Hole.  Thank you, Ann.  Jimmy's role.  All right, so now we're up to open up your teen ass, pause, hole for Anthony contest.  Can't possibly work.  Jimmy, we can't get contestants for the change thing.  We're up to open up your teen ass hole. 
[03:58:00]  Open up your teen ass hole for Anthony.  No, no, no.  Make sure you got the pause in there, Jimmy.  Or how about, if it's too long to put that on a flyer, how about this?  Uh, prom cunt.  How about prom cunt?  You're the winner of the prom cunt contest, which means you get to get me, Anthony Cumia,  a big celebrity with an even bigger cock and huger bank account, to take you, the pig, 
[03:58:30]  to your prom.  First prize is you drink a load out of my balls.  That's also second and third prize.  Fourth prize is you get your ass and pussy fucked in that order.  All right, we're on to some, man.  And bear with us.  We're on to something here.  I drop you off at the end of the evening with a fucking, with a load stuck to your back  and your fucking, your stupid, needing money father comes out and clears my cock off with  your mother's wedding gown.  At least the strapless dress will, at least the strapless dress will stay on after all that 
[03:59:00]  cum on your back.  All right, Ann.  Prom cunt.  Ann, are you the one?  Brought to you by the Opie and Anthony program.  Ann, are you in?  People are very excited.  They're typing in caps at this point.  This will never work.  That's right.  And you do a special dance.  Right.  You get to do a fucking, you get to slow dance with this slob after a Cialis with your big  dick pressing against her.  Right.  And they play the chicken dance at the prom.  And you slow dance with this fucking manatee. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Prom cunt.  She gets, you know what she has to do?  She has to fucking drain a load out of your balls and then go fucking knuckle deep in  your asshole.  And then fucking her father gets to smell the fingers for extra money and guess which  one was in your ass.  And if he, if he, if he guesses, if he guesses right, you don't punch his daughter in the  face.  Prom cunt.  I can't.  Sponsored by XM Satellite Radio.  Void where prohibited.  We're definitely on to something, but more suggestions coming in. 
[04:00:00]  Instead of open up your teen ass hole for Anthony Contest, they're suggesting that we adjusted  just slightly and, and, uh, and rename it.  Where the fuck did it go?  All right.  Get the pin or corsage on right into her fat torso and you just stick it right into 
[04:00:30]  her.  You just, what you do is you fucking put a safety pin into a plastic flower and you just  fucking palm it right into her fat tit.  Yeah.  What do you say?  Here you go, slobo.  Come on, slobo.  Time to head to the dance.  Maybe you can roll a marble on the dance floor and then hit her on the back and she'll  eat it like hungry, hungry hippo.  That's the fucking prom song you dance to.  Hungry, hungry hippo.  Then you fucking, you stick your dick right in her shitter in the parking lot and dad picks 
[04:01:00]  her up.  She has to fucking sit on her side and sit properly.  I'm a fucking side bone.  How was it?  Let's, uh, let's Google bomb the name of this contest so we get a little, uh, so it has  some legs.  The only thing, and you might have to come up with like, um, first semester, uh, tuition  for a college, but that's easy.  You fucking wear a white, a white tuxedo, a white tuxedo to show the fucking damage on 
[04:01:30]  the front.  You want her father just by the colors on the front of it to know how many holes you  got in.  Well, I see a clear crustacean mixed with red, but no brown.  Thank God.  My girl, she kept her on a, she saved her asshole.  Douglas, uh, from Austin writes, my daughter was demolished by Anthony Tuesday.  Well, here's, uh, Don, the trucker.  He writes, uh, open up your teen ass hole. 
[04:02:00]  Very good with the dot, dot, dot.  Thank you, Don.  And give Mel Carmers in a heart attack contest.  Fuck, I like that, man.  Yeah.  What do you say?  Are you in?  Oh, you gotta be in.  You want to, you want to sleep on it?  You know, run it, run it past Logan.  Yeah, see what he thinks about that.  See how that, see how that goes past that ELO.  And there's a special bonus, when the fucking millionaire comes to pick up your fucking  white trash daughter, your wife can suck his balls and then wipe her fucking brow with 
[04:02:30]  his pubes.  What do you think of that, you fucking cuckold?  And the millionaire will throw a few bucks at you, and you and your wife can both fish  around on the linoleum for them.  The way Sonny threw the money down at the camera, Anthony can throw a few fucking tens down.  Oh.  There you go, fetch.  Oh, shit.  I found those legs.  I found the line, by the way.  We just, uh, just in the first word of the contest, to pull open your teen ass hole for 
[04:03:00]  Anthony.  Pull open.  Contest.  Oh.  It's very, it's a subtle change, but I think it gets the point across.  Well, pull open implies that she's putting her hands in her ass cheeks and, like, using  her middle fingers from each one and just grabbing the cheek and physically opening it harshly.  Right.  You know, the way one would fucking, uh, what would you open, you know, when you try to  open a new piece of electronics, it comes in that fucking hard plastic shell.  Yes.  You finally get a knife in there and you have to position your, your, your fingers in there 
[04:03:30]  and pull, like, that's how you're going to open your fucking, your frightened prom asshole.  It's supposed to be the biggest night of your life and you're going home with a millionaire's  load and your fucking pubes.  What do you think of that, Mr. Big Night?  Take your fucking, take your corsage out and fucking vomit.  Yeah.  So we get, we'll need an answer.  You can sleep on it.  Oh.  All right?  All right.  Either that or, uh, or, uh, Black Panther hunting. 
[04:04:00]  No, there's no Black Panther hunting thing.  All right, so you're open to this idea, right?  Oh, oh yeah, this will go over.  And she's fat, so we have to put a little thing around her and we'll call it a cumberbunt.  Open your hole for Anthony's pole contest, uh, Stig.  Yes.  Ream your teen contest, three-line gypsy.  Uh, well, Dry Blood is suggesting we go with the contest, uh, we name it The Cock of Love. 
[04:04:30]  It has to be a prom theme.  Yeah, of course.  It certainly does, Jimmy.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right, good.  I think we're on to something.  Yeah, I like that prom rapist.  I like prom rapist.  Where you can, you have to be 18 or older to enter, but you can, you can enter for a  chance to win a brutal assault on your prom night by fucking Anthony in the limo in your  driveway.  And then he fucking speeds off at his Shelby. 
[04:05:00]  Or you show up at your own prom with a black eye.  Yeah, because he really has better things to do than hang out with you all night.  You show up with a black eye and try to make the most of it, your fifth wheel.  Yeah, you'll, you'll, you'll spend all day getting all pretty, you'll spend all day getting  ready for your prom, and it's only going to be with you for five minutes.  That's right.  The Shelby will still be running.  That's right.  A nice assault right in the limo in your fucking, right in your driveway while your parents  wave stupidly.  Right.  They have no idea what's going on in the backseat.  Boy, they sure are in the driveway for a long time. 
[04:05:30]  And they fucking see the window crack.  And they have a feeling it might have been your head getting smashed against it on the  inside, but they're not sure.  Right.  Holy shit.  Fucking.  All right.  We got to decide on a name.  We got to decide on a name because my bro's ready to go into production with the t-shirts.  So what are we going with?  Pull open?  You have a sick motherfucker.  What is going to be on the t-shirt?  Pull open?  We haven't figured it out. 
[04:06:00]  Brother Elmo, we need a t-shirt for this.  It's brilliant.  It's brilliant in how simple it is.  Milk Anthony's pole contest?  Milk Anthony like a cow?  It just isn't going to fucking work.  Why?  What seems to be the problem?  Everything.  We could adjust the name a little bit.  A little?  Yeah, but you know.  Oh, God.  That's right.  We'll give him a little bit on the name, but the rest of it we got to be tough about.  I'm going to be fucking laughing.  And bring your appetite. 
[04:06:30]  Bring your appetite.  You're going to be sucking a lot of load.  That's right.  Maybe we could just call it your special night.  Right.  But it's so sarcastic.  All right.  Because your special night.  Well, special in quotations.  Your special night.  Yeah.  If fucking you'd never make it into the dance.  You're fucking, you're drinking Anthony's goat cheese.  Yeah.  In the fucking, in the back of the limo.  Let's get a rider together.  Oh, Jesus.  And make her the only girl that sucks cock on the dance floor while everyone else is slow 
[04:07:00]  dancing around her.  Yeah.  You have to, you have to service Anthony on the dance floor.  On the dance floor while everyone else is, you know, thinking that they're in love.  While they're all dancing and falling in love.  Right.  You have to hold fucking cocktail franks in one hand.  Right.  And blow the millionaire.  That's right.  Cocktail franks in your hand.  And it's a, and it's a giant hog.  So you're not going to be able to hide what you're doing from anyone.  Why cocktail franks?  Because we said so.  That's right.  Pigs in a blanket.  Yeah.  Pigs in a blanket.  Cocktail weenies, fatty. 
[04:07:30]  Hold them.  I can't fucking take this.  Just so your fingers smell like hot dog franks on the way home.  And you know, and this will show how good we are.  We're good guys here.  We will supply the diaper after Anthony ruins your ass so he can enjoy the rest of the prom.  Right.  Without fucking butterscotching your new dress.  No one wants to butterscotch while the fucking, while your prom song is playing.  Your date can meet you there.  After Kumia wrecks you in the fucking limo, you can get out and see your stupid senior date. 
[04:08:00]  Right.  He stands there with a fucking corsage, a flower to hand you.  And a goofy emo look.  But he should be handing you his fucking Oxycontin and anal stitches.  All right, Ant.  We're so on to something here.  Yeah. 
[04:08:30]  Yeah.  We're on to something.  All right.  Did you write all that down, Dan?  Dan wrote it all down.  We're going to run it by Washington.  We got no room for fucking, no vague language in this contest.  We insist.  This has to be.  We insist on this one.  We want the lawyers to approve this one.  We're not willing to budge.  Not willing to budge on this one.  Not willing to budge on this one.  We've budged enough over the years.  This is one they need to give to us.  Well, how about chocolate prom? 
[04:09:00]  At the end of the night, for your prize, you fucking lay back in the limo and fucking  Comey and drops a shit right in your mouth and then leaves without an explanation.  Pac-2 from Philly writes, the deep dick under the sea.  Yeah.  We get some potential for chocolate prom.  You all right with this, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  Just run it past Washington.  All right.  We'll run it.  It'll go off really well.  We're going to hope that they blue sky this by Wednesday. 
[04:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure it will be.  I'm sure we'll have to let it bake for a day or two.  But after that, we should be good to go.  All right.  I'm going to be laughing all fucking day because of Jimmy.  I'm Anthony Cumia, and I approve this message.  Hey, it's Opie from the Opie and Anthony Show.  By now, you probably know that Anthony is single.  He broke up with his girl right around prom season.  I think Anthony wants to go to a prom. 
[04:10:00]  Bring Anthony to your prom.  We're looking for women out there that would consider taking Anthony to their prom.  You can be Anthony's prom date.  Send a picture to us.  Where?  I don't know because I don't have, like, someone's email in front of me.  But I think voice guy will tell you where to send your picture.  Call 866-FU-LINE-1 if you're interested in being Anthony's prom date.  I think Anthony wants to go to a prom.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  It's a prom date with Anthony.  And please be 18 or older.  Thank you.  Over and out.  Now I've got to cut it loose.  Put it loose. 
[04:10:30]  Can't stop the sudden that's used.  Hey, we've got something that's been making its way around one of the fan sites.  I don't know which one.  I would give you credit.  But the Quincy clip.  Oh.  See, Jimmy does Jim C, obviously.  Jim C.  Which is based on Quincy, obviously.  Loosely based on the Quincy character is Jim C, which is exactly like Quincy.  There have been similarities.  People have pointed out.  Yeah.  No fingerprint expert.  He has certain weird clipped words. 
[04:11:00]  Yeah.  Clips.  And now.  Clip.  I guess the next stage of this bit, people are finding Quincy clips that they think are  ridiculous or funny or whatever.  And it's not supposed to be funny because it was a drama.  It was a drama.  No one really realizes that this show had credibility.  It was a serious show.  And it was on the heels of The Odd Couple.  It was after he had left The Odd Couple as Oscar Madison.  So it was kind of odd to see him in a drama.  There was some comedic moments and comedy elements throughout the thing. 
[04:11:30]  But basically, it was supposed to be like a serious show.  Right.  And at the time, I don't know how, but it was.  Now, though, you listen back and it's like, this is horrible.  It stinks.  And when Quincy would talk, he would take his thumb and he would take the other four fingers.  Picture going, mama me.  Right, right.  The way you do your fingers.  Mama me.  That's how he would talk.  Like, even when he was just talking casually.  He's a harder guy to do when he's not angry.  Yeah, yeah. 
[04:12:00]  But he's always wearing a dick sweater or some fucking Iranian president members only jacket.  And is this the punk rock clip?  Yeah.  Oh, I hope so.  He wants to talk to a bunch of punk rockers.  This stinks.  It's almost a parody of a show that stinks.  Oh, yeah.  It's so bad.  Yeah.  It's so completely bad.  He's in a punk rock bar.  You want to play the first clip, even though it's slightly long?  I mean, the punk rock clips are the big get here, but the first clip's funny because the  over-the-top caring is like, why would you care about the answer to it? 
[04:12:30]  Right.  It's the one we listened to earlier.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I got you.  Well, let's start with this clip from Quincy way back in the day, and then we'll get to  the punk club.  Punk clips.  I can blow them up even bigger if you want, Quincy.  Oh, thanks.  You can blow them up the size of an elephant.  We still wouldn't get a clear print out of it.  Clear print.  Clear print.  Just as in my day.  Not your day.  What problems are you having?  I'm just overlapping the crispy family.  That was some of Steve's acting right there.  Not your day.  That was his fucking awful boss. 
[04:13:00]  John Astin, his real name was, I think?  I don't know.  Was it?  That fucking dumb mustache.  What was his name?  How'd your parents die?  Yeah.  I don't know.  We haven't done an autopsy.  You're going to blow it up as big as an elephant.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  I'm not going to get a clear print.  Print.  Clear print.  Here, listen to the Steve acted by the other guy.  This isn't my day.  It's not your day.  What problems are you having?  One's over on the ice brick.  These?  Yeah.  Well, what about them?  Why don't we blow them up?  Hoping to squeeze some more information out of them, but no such luck. 
[04:13:30]  Now, Quincy, maybe there is a way to unscrramble these prints.  It's like trying to put the toothpaste back into the tube.  There isn't a fingerprint man alive who'll get a positive ID based on what's here.  Not a man, but a machine, maybe.  Machine?  I had visions of buying one until I looked at the price.  Remember that computer show I went to in May?  At the convention center?  Yeah.  Who cares where it was?  At the convention center?  No, no, the arena.  You sure?  Because I remember the one at the convention center.  Right.  Who cares where it was? 
[04:14:00]  A computer show at the convention center where they have one computer?  Yeah, one computer.  See, because they were real large back then.  That's my large computer joke.  It was so bad, the information they were giving.  It was too pricey back in May.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  Just a machine?  Machine?  What, a computer?  A machine?  I was going to get one, but it was a little too pricey.  Oh, you a Jew.  So because it was too pricey, there's like dozens of murders they're not going to solve.  Yeah.  It's not too pricey. 
[04:14:30]  It's not too pricey.  I'll try to do it the old-fashioned way and save a few bucks.  We wouldn't have fingerprints, Sam, but the boss is a Jew.  That's right.  This guy never saw a penny that he didn't like.  We can't get a clear print.  A clear print.  I bet we could get clear prints off a penny from your pocket.  A pocket.  You're a Jew.  That's a question of anti-Semites.  There's six million of them, Sam, and they're hiding somewhere. 
[04:15:00]  Bobby Fisher was right.  The whole thing was a lie.  They were never murdered.  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking crime lab.  You're in my...  Quincy.  My.  My.  Yeah.  This plot was murdered.  Here, let's go back to this clip.  Went to a May.  At the convention center?  Yeah. 
[04:15:30]  Quincy, they had a graphics computer that could take two combined pictures and separate the images.  No.  Do you remember who was displaying it?  But I was too cheap to buy it.  Too cheap.  Oy vey, Quincy.  Right.  Do you remember who was displaying it?  Calm down.  Maybe I'll just give them a call.  Pick up some modern computer equipment there, huh?  Help Quincy out.  Right.  It could actually separate two sets of fingerprints and play pong at the same time. 
[04:16:00]  That's awful.  So then Quincy, in this particular episode, he goes to a punk rock club.  Yeah.  And he convinces the punk rock club manager to let him go on stage and talk to the youth.  He wanted to talk to the kids.  But do you have...  Is the plot where he's trying to convince them, and like, I just convinced them, and  the fuck...  He's wearing this shit dick sweater, and the manager stinks. 
[04:16:30]  Go ahead.  It's so bad.  If you want to, good luck with that.  And the punk rock kids are...  Not kids, first of all.  Right out of central casting, as they like to say.  Just awful.  The dialogue.  Hey, man.  Right.  They're just really not convincing.  They look like they have Halloween costumes on.  Yeah, it looks like now how you would Halloween dress as a punk.  Right, of course.  Well, they can't have real punk rockers on TV. 
[04:17:00]  That would scare the shit out of everybody.  It was wholesome TV back then.  So this is the edgiest they could get if they have a punk rock character.  But look at how fucking fast the music shuts down.  They're all quiet.  Listen, there's nothing not awful about this.  It's amazing how they took awfulness, and they just stretched it over a bunch of moments.  And wasn't punk rock all about, fuck the establishment.  Yeah.  Establishment.  And as soon as Quincy walks on, obviously, like, he's the establishment.  Oh, the music shuts down.  Everyone is quiet immediately.  They'd be like, what the fuck? 
[04:17:30]  Wouldn't you just start throwing chairs at the man?  I wish it was a Gigi Allen show.  Right.  He could shit in Quincy's face.  Fucking shit out of banana.  He just shoved up his ass into Quincy's mouth.  Him and his brother Merle would have homosexual relations, Sam.  He's pissing on the crowd.  Gigi.  A Gigi Allen show.  Fucking Gigi.  I want to talk to the murder junkies.  The murder junkies.  The murder junkies.  Here's something about Gigi. 
[04:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  Could we stop the muse?  You hate me and I hate you.  He's throwing feces at me, Sam.  And I think I say I do.  So what's new?  You never liked me, so I say fuck you.  Yeah.  You know, you know.  Quincy tapping his foot, singing along.  Fuck you.  And fuck you.  Quincy's shoving a banana up his ass and throwing it at the audience.  With the stupid Mamma Mia fingers.  Mamma Mia fingers. 
[04:18:30]  Looks like the Italian guy on a pizza box.  Yeah, exactly what it is.  If I could just talk to him.  Everything's an intense moment.  How about this?  You give us an autopsy report and then go fuck cardboard ass.  Cardboard ass.  Because that's what he's supposed to do.  The coroner isn't going out investigating at some punk rock club.  Of course he's not.  He's a coroner.  He's a cop.  He's a lover.  He's an alcoholic.  He rubs his fucking dirty balls on his boss's awful mustache.  And he fingers Lieutenant Monaghan's ass when he's fucking tired. 
[04:19:00]  Busy man, that Quincy.  They play Let's Check the Prostate.  We both know what it's about.  Sticks his whole hand in there with his Mamma Mia hands.  Just four, five fingers go up there.  I'm going to fist you.  Here we go.  This is Quincy talking to the punk rock club manager before he goes on stage.  It's great.  We need your help.  I want to go on stage for two minutes and talk to the kids.  Maybe you'd like to take over to the opening act.  You paint a target on your head, I might arrange it.  I want to find an innocent girl. 
[04:19:30]  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  It's just too much to ask for a few minutes to try to save a life.  Hey, be my guest.  But if you expect any of these kids to help you out, you've got another guest coming.  Go ahead.  This should be fun.  That's punk rock, by the way.  Go ahead.  This should be fun.  It sounds like...  I am rock quarry.  And listen to the music that's supposed to represent punk rock.  Yeah, that was the punk rock band playing in the background.  See, they can't even commit because it's stupid TV. 
[04:20:00]  It's just some kind of easy listening rock.  Kind of like Dwayne Allman or something.  It's not punk.  No, that was punk, man.  I want to help an innocent girl.  Girl.  And the guy is like, well, baby, you've got another guest coming if you think those kids.  It's like they took everyone who auditioned and started from the bottom up.  Like the worst actor got the game.  No, then you heard, well, what are you going to say when you go up there?  If that's the guy that got it, how bad were the ones that didn't?  What did they say? 
[04:20:30]  No, that's no good.  You didn't speak English.  It was close.  All right, we'll give him a call back.  All right, here's Quincy trying to talk to the kids from the stage, man.  Please tell me the awful music stops.  I think so, yeah.  Please, can I be a guest?  Please.  It's very important.  There you go.  Wow.  Dead silent.  Wow, just like that.  Not shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  Who are you?  Put the music back on, asshole.  Yeah, what happened to fuck the man? 
[04:21:00]  Please, can I be a guest?  Please.  It's very important.  Oh, God.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Now, many of you know Abigail Garvin.  Garvin.  And all of you know that the police are looking for in connection with a murder that happened  right here in front of this stage.  Now, all the charges against her have been dropped.  She's innocent.  If she comes back, nothing will be done to her.  Why should we believe you?  If I knew who that girl was, I sure as hell wouldn't tell a cop.  Because that's how you are, man.  It's a dog without a uniform. 
[04:21:30]  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  This is so fucking bad.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  I'm rubbing your glue.  Sticks and stones can break my bones.  That's right.  But names will never hurt that girl.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  You can call me a coroner.  You can call me a sloppy sports reporter.  Just over the top acting.  Call me a flat ass fucker. 
[04:22:00]  Right.  If she comes back, nothing will be done to her.  Why should we believe you?  If I knew who that girl was, I sure as hell wouldn't tell a cop.  Because that's how you are, man.  It's a dog without a uniform.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  I'm only interested in helping Abby.  This is right out of a John Wayne movie.  Is there four people in the club?  The guy's killing.  Yeah, there's like 20 people.  Big crazy club.  Yeah.  He's just a dog without a uniform.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  Names you call me. 
[04:22:30]  An asshole.  It isn't just the worst.  I'm rubbing your glue.  Sam has tiny genitals.  Look, we have reason to believe  that she's with Zach's real murderer, Molly Howard,  and Molly is trying to push her into a codeine overdose.  So please, if you have any information.  That's a crock, mister.  You think we're all zombie killers.  You're the killers.  Your whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  We're just your lousy scapegoat.  Besides, man. 
[04:23:00]  The scapegoat?  Who the hell cares?  And Vince leaves the stage  dejected and unsuccessful.  Oh, well.  Mamma Mia hands in pocket.  And he gives all the details.  Molly Howard is trying to push her  into a codeine overdose.  Shut up.  What?  They would just be sitting there going,  what?  An extra aspirin?  I mean, wow.  Codeine overdose?  What?  A little outrageous, huh?  Whoa, hey.  Molly Howard is trying to get her 
[04:23:30]  to take Tylenol PM.  She's giving her melatonin.  Instead of regular Tylenol,  it's Tylenol PM.  It's just a horrid dialogue.  She's taking Abby's Breathe Right strips  and rubbing them in her own ass crack first.  Considering they won't be invented for years.  Stupid Quincy.  Quincy stinks.  Quincy's a cunt.  He stinks.  Listen again.  It's the typical punk rock speech, man.  Yeah, man.  You're the problem, man. 
[04:24:00]  Society.  Society's the problem.  Does the dopey kid say a scapegoat?  He says a scapegoat.  Your whole sick society  with his dumb accent.  Look, we have reason to believe  that she's with Zach's real murderer,  Molly Howard,  and Molly is trying to push her  into a codeine overdose.  So please,  if you have any information.  That's a crock, mister.  You think we're all zombie killers.  You're the killers.  Your whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  We're just your lousy scapegoat. 
[04:24:30]  Besides, man,  who the hell cares?  Yeah.  That really got him right there.  When the kid said,  who the hell cares?  Yeah.  It's like,  well, no one cares.  How do I battle that?  Smokezilla writes,  Cody and Overdose,  are they doing cough syrup shooters?  And someone else,  Jimmy Jakes writes,  I love that they just all take turns  yelling at Quincy.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't all jump on at once  and trying to shut the fuck up.  Your line,  my line, 
[04:25:00]  her line,  his line,  back to me line.  You're sick society.  Society.  And he said,  escape goat.  Escape goat.  It's like,  he was wrong.  The word is escape  and he shouldn't have used it there.  No.  Anyway.  There you go.  Some Quincy audio.  Yeah.  That was an actual,  a legitimate program back then.  Yeah.  Were people just dumber back then?  Was TV all so bad  and unrealistic? 
[04:25:30]  We just didn't know any better,  man.  It was that sick society.  It just seems like something like,  we should have looked and gone,  I don't think a coroner does this.  Hey,  this is Brian O'Halloran.  And this is Jeff Anderson  from Clerks and Clerks 2.  And you're listening to  the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Shouldn't we just say  this is Dante and Randall?  Nobody knows who the heck  Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson are.  Yeah,  that is true.  Opie and Anthony.  The worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[04:26:00]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no.  Is that Lindsay Lohan?  I actually saw this.  Who is it?  Little Joni Cunningham.  Ew,  no.  Erin Moran. 
[04:26:30]  Wait,  is there a porno with her?  No,  it's fake.  It's from Celebrity Fit Club.  Well,  then what the fuck was she doing?  They were having a dumb little party  and she decided to do a fake orgasm for everybody.  That is so unsexy.  Absolutely.  Don't yell out fucking directions like that.  I know.  Right there,  right there,  right there,  right there,  right there.  All right.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no, 
[04:27:00]  often did Joanie gives Chachi a brown shower.  He called her because she's shit in mid sentence.  He goes,  give it to me short curve.  Short curve.  Short curve.  Oh God.  To call her chocolate cake.  It's awful.  Then they would use a glad baggie. 
[04:27:30]  Tom Bosley would kill her glad baggie and clean off Scott Baio's face.  It only lasted four episodes.  It was the same thing every week.  She eats for the first half and then shits on his face for the second half.  She wanted to give Chachi a brown shower.  And then Fonzie's other little nephew, Spike, would come in and give Chachi's balls a tickle.  Remember Mullet Letter Tuscadero?  I'm a dyke. 
[04:28:00]  I'm a dyke.  Oh, fuck.  I'm a dyke.  I'm a dyke.  I'm a dyke.  Oh, fucking fat.  God damn, Jimmy.  Stupid Ron Howard.  Fucking bald by season three.  Had enough of him.  You get it.  You're a director now.  Fuck yourself.  Marianne Ross actually had a clit ring.  Did you know that?  She had a big meaty clit with a ring on it.  It looked like Ed Bradley's ear.  Except not black with cancer. 
[04:28:30]  Fuck, man.  Fuck, man.  Holy shit.  Fonzie was fucking twins as usual.  They're both four.  The fucking dogs. 
[04:29:00]  Give it taste.  Hey.  Yeah, the twins are coming off and they're just fucking...  Yeah, crawl around.  Jenny Piccolo farted a cum bubble.  Right into Chuck's mouth.  That's why he had to leave after season one.  Because he took a cum bubble in the mouth and no one respected him.  They were like, you're a cuckold, Chuck.  He's like, no, I'm a basketball player.  I beat it, cuckold. 
[04:29:30]  He moved to Milwaukee to act out rape fantasies with Laverne DeFazio.  She wanted to be raped with a schlitz bottle.  Oh, my fucking stomach hurts.  You could work for work in there somehow.  Remember, Robin Williams starred on Happy Days. 
[04:30:00]  Don't forget about Ralph Mal.  Ralph Mal's father was a dentist, actually.  And he got Patsy in the chair and then with his mouth open.  He just fucked Patsy's mouth.  Mr. Mouth.  Gave fucking Anthony Williams a mouthful of jizz.  Take that, you crooning faggot.  Then sit on Al Molinaro's nose.  Fuck yourself with Al's nose.  Why did Al leave the show? 
[04:30:30]  And then Pat Morita with his little Asian dick.  That's right.  He actually wanted to do that first movie with Joni.  He wanted to call it the Karate Cunt.  But they said, no one will put this on a billboard.  It's got to be kids.  It's him karate chopping her clit.  He keeps going, hey, ah, and she's like, ow. 
[04:31:00]  Dickie Punchcock from Whackbag writes, pinky sock, Tuscan Darrow.  He gave her a pink sock, Cunningham.  Hey, oh, Cunningham, I'm gay.  I just barked mouth.  He said sit on it, so I did.  What are you talking about?  Of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, okay.  Catch Opie and Anthony live from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. Eastern with replays throughout the day on XM 202. 
[04:31:30]  Want more?  Go to opiananthony.com.  Oh, my God.  Why is banana phone playing?  Oh, that doesn't sound like Elvis.  Helpy's phone.  Hello?  It's not about ratings.  Shut up.  Who's this?  It's not about good ratings.  Shut up.  Exactly.  Citibank, I don't know my job.  You fucking asshole.  Hang up, cunt face.  Shut up, you fucking bank piece of shit.  We know what you are.  After 11 o'clock.  All Jews. 
[04:32:00]  Jews.  After 11.  Citibank is for faggots.  I got the TV on.  Yeah.  Sperm bank.  How about that?  All right.  Swallow your receipts.  By the way.  You fucking robbery.  It's all robbery.  You fucking fees on your machines.  By the way, look at my accounts.  I get paid to do this.  All right.  I'll hang up already.  Bob, you.  They probably want you for all its worth.  I'll talk to you later.  Take your money. 
[04:32:30]  Fucking money lender.  I was just trying to say bank.  I was just trying to say bank.  I was just trying to say bank.  I was just trying to say bank.  I was just trying to say bank.  I was just trying to say bank.  I was just trying to say bank.  I was just trying to say bank.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Ah, that's that old gag.  People saying that they're psyched that you're here, Keith.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That'll change in a couple of minutes.  Flight of the Valkyries, right.  All right.  Sweet Caroline by others.  It's not flight.  It's ride.  Yes.  Yeah, it wouldn't be flight.  Flight of the Bumblebee.  Flight of the Bumblebee.  That song makes me nervous.  Damn.  I feel like I should be doing something. 
[04:33:00]  Keith brought up a great point on the way in.  It's so fucking cold outside that people are just cursing to themselves.  Yeah, they are.  We're on the elevator, and there's people you don't know on the elevator, and you walk  in because you're just out of the cold, and you're just standing there going, fuck.  Shit.  Fuck.  This fucking shit.  And that's how people are bonding, actually.  Like, fuck.  They look at each other.  Yeah.  You walk into a building out of a cold spot.  You just look at each other and go, fuck.  Like, you'll kind of point at the door and go, shit. 
[04:33:30]  But people know what you mean.  Like, someone will go, fuck, and you go, I know, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Fuck, shit.  Ridiculous out there.  Right.  I said it was Everest cold out, and Jimmy had to tell me, you know, it's a hundred mile  an hour winds up there, and the temperatures are a lot colder.  So, Jimmy let me know it was a little colder on Everest than it is outside of New York right  now.  And then here's what I said, which really, I should be fucking just cracked across my  open mouth.  I said, that's the cruising altitude of an airplane. 
[04:34:00]  Just the fact that I said airplane, that's like a five-year-old speaking.  Fuck it.  What else could be cruising at that?  My airplanes were up there.  What else cruises at that altitude?  Faggots in spacesuits?  Whoa.  Watch that F word.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  You're up on the F word, right?  The new F word, because the old F word doesn't matter anymore.  The old F word used to be fuck.  We should be calling it the new F word.  Just be an initial.  That word, yeah.  Yeah, you'll just be able to have an acronym for people. 
[04:34:30]  He's just an effing F.  Are you a fan of banning the N word there, Keith?  No.  Nigger needs to be said.  Nigger can be said.  It can always be said.  Nigger can be said.  Faggot should be allowed all the time.  Someone said it best on our show.  I would love to give them credit, but they're like, look, you can use the word all you want,  but there's a consequence for using it.  And I agree with that.  Well, I mean, it is a consequence, but, Nick, you can say, everybody in here should be able  to say, nigger.  I should be able to say. 
[04:35:00]  Oh, we do.  I know you do.  With the mics on and off.  Usually in my car.  I would like it to be when the mic's off, but you guys just let it sail.  Look, there are consequences.  When I saw you in the elevator with us, I was like, I didn't know I was coming by today.  Do you love Ann Coulter?  I love her.  Yeah.  I love that she's not taking any shit about it.  And she won't apologize.  Yeah.  You have to love Ann Coulter.  Good.  I love her.  She's still goofing on her.  Don't you?  Whatever.  I said it. 
[04:35:30]  Go fuck yourself.  A big man neck.  You do have to love her fucking ignorance.  Big Adam Zappel go, gulp.  Am I in trouble?  Gulp.  Half a man.  Oh, and everybody's trying to distance themselves from her.  And she's just still going, I love it.  She don't care.  It's great.  But yeah, I think that whatever you want to use.  And some people go, it's un-American.  That word should be banned.  And it's like, you just put those two statements together?  Banning words and un-American? 
[04:36:00]  Right.  Right.  Fucking constitution.  It's the amendment they figured to make the first.  It was the most important one.  Let's make it number fucking one.  And then they talk about banning words because they're offensive.  There's no right.  It says you have the right to not be offended.  Well, I don't...  You know what?  The thing to me, I want to see...  It's like, they should have, like, words, the top words.  Like, the top faggot is coming up.  It's almost a...  Faggot coming up the charts.  Yes, coming up the charts.  Nigger's still coming in as number one. 
[04:36:30]  He's still holding his top slot, but faggot is on his way.  Faggot's on his way up the charts.  A few more big people use that word.  We need one more person.  We need one more person.  We need one more person.  One more big person the same thing.  And honky hasn't been on the charts in 20 years.  He's been a long time since the Jefferson.  Yeah, exactly.  Honky.  Honky.  No matter how hard you try, you can say it as hard as you want.  You honkies are getting on my nerves.  They'll just laugh.  Ah, you guys.  I got to be honest.  We've always laughed at honky.  It's just silly.  And it's never been used in a bad way, except maybe in an old Clint Eastwood movie. 
[04:37:00]  But it's always been like a funny kind of term to use on the Jeffersons, like you said.  But even Archie Bunker never said nigger.  You know?  I mean, that was always kind of like, meh.  I think Archie Bunker even said the N-word back then.  Even he was politically correct.  Yeah.  I don't think.  But now by saying the N-word, you're saying the word.  So now they're going to have to ban saying N-word.  We said they're just going to have to go, mm-hmm.  And they're trying to ban the word, mm-hmm. 
[04:37:30]  Because the N-word is now just as bad as a word because you're just replacing it.  I want a few more attacks on faggot word.  I want to hear faggot more.  That's what I want to hear.  That'll bring it back up the chest.  I want it up the way it's supposed to be.  Climate number two.  Faggot is timeless, man.  I love that word.  We're talking about it like it's fucking Dark Side of the Moon.  This is great.  It's always going to be on the charts.  It's just there.  It's a classic.  It rolls off your tongue just right.  Yeah.  Faggot.  Give it a whirl.  Faggot. 
[04:38:00]  Faggot.  Faggot.  It is.  It's funny.  Happy.  Are you a faggot?  Get out of here.  Yeah, faggot.  It works in every way possible.  Every way.  Happy.  Angry.  Yeah.  You tell it.  You can say it to your friends knowing they're not gay.  You just go, stop.  Don't be a faggot.  Get your keys.  We're fucking going out.  You know what?  In a neighborhood, we can use both words in the same sentence.  You faggot-ass niggas are getting on my nerves.  Look at that.  Beautiful.  And it means no hate speech there whatsoever.  Nothing hateful about it.  You love the person you're saying it to. 
[04:38:30]  Yeah.  But you could be sad saying that thing, too.  Like, you could be going, what's the matter?  My son's a faggot.  And he's saying the nigger.  And he's saying the nigger.  Oh, is that the only two words that are offensive that people like that?  No, no, no.  Squaw.  Squaw.  Squaw is working its way up now, but I don't think it's got popular support.  Indians do not like the word squaw.  That's like an R&B song.  It's not popular.  I know.  Yeah.  It's kind of laying low. 
[04:39:00]  Nobody cares.  It's not a crossover hit yet.  It's a category that no one cares about.  But the Indians have been successful with getting teams to change their names, sports teams,  to change their names.  The Redskins.  Well, the Redskins still, but I mean a few more.  Like the Redmen.  The Redmen changed their names.  Red Storm.  Red Storm.  The Kansas City Chiefs, like, said, you know, nope, we're not changing.  No, no, like pro sports.  But, yeah, enough money.  I agree with the Indians, though, on this one.  I'm not the Squaw.  How do you agree with the Indians?  Because they're the only group that's allowed to be kind of car. 
[04:39:30]  I heard them explaining it one time on a talk show, and they were just like, look, they're  cartooning us.  And if you do that with another group, I mean, they're fighting Irish.  The Irish just don't care.  But Indians kind of have a history in this country of, you know, mass slaughter and genocide.  You know, I get their point on it.  Redskins was a term used to pile up Indian bodies.  That was a pile of redskins.  That was how that term came into effect.  I thought it was just their redskins.  No, it was like.  No, there's always some horrible story to it.  You know where the word coffee pot came from? 
[04:40:00]  What the fuck happened?  I really am a fucking mood killer at the Super Bowl.  Oh, shit, dude.  The real history behind the Indians.  Shut up.  What the fuck?  I just wanted to do my tomahawk chopper.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You know what, Jim?  There's no history behind the word nigger.  No, that's nothing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's no team called that either.  All right, let's start one.  Yeah.  Believe me.  You know the history of the Indians.  They were really treated bad.  Nigger is great.  But when they start saying, look, the Jersey niggers lost by eight points tonight, then you'll 
[04:40:30]  be correct.  You can't name a team after black people.  But how great would that be if one of the NBA teams decided to change their name?  Oh, my God.  Well, with all the hip-hop artists and basketball teams, you may get it.  Yeah.  I get it.  Wearing the swag, wearing the shirts, the team's logo.  Just make it N-I-G-G-A-S.  The Brooklyn niggers.  Yeah.  That would be nice.  By the way, we're having fun, but I've got to just acknowledge something.  Hopi.  I went to chew this pen.  Don Rickles?  Oh, I thought you were going to go, we all love each other here. 
[04:41:00]  We're having a lot of fun with these words, people.  Hockey puck.  I just went to chew this pen, and it's a pre-chewed pen that someone else chewed because I did  not recognize my own chewing.  It's probably you.  No.  Oh, you recognize, what, do you leave a fucking mark on there that you can identify?  You know when you're, yeah.  You just see us.  You know the bite pattern?  I want to puke.  Why?  Just because maybe someone else had it behind it.  You ever smell somebody's, like...  Oh, smell this.  No, I will not. 
[04:41:30]  Smell it.  Under no circumstances.  Why?  Interns.  Why?  Get an intern in here.  Scum.  Yes.  All right.  Just get a...  Intern's going to be a word that they...  The I word.  It's just going to be the I word.  I like this kid.  This is Jeremy from Atlanta.  Let's see if we can get him.  He's a go-getter.  He's a good boy.  Oh, by the way, someone's reminding us, you know, we're not going to do the obvious  and play sparkling wiggles for Keith today, but the definition of the N-word,  Luis C. Gay, explain it perfectly. 
[04:42:00]  Do we have that?  I wish we had that.  Well, something in a few minutes.  Yeah, I know.  He'll get it.  Yeah, go find that.  A white guy gave you the definition of...  No, Luis.  Luis Mexican.  Oh, right.  It was the origin of the word.  The guy called origin.  Luis Mexican convenience.  Yeah, I wouldn't...  You're right.  He's Mexican when he needs a federal grant.  Do you hear best definition for the word, by the way, coming up?  It's actually the origin of the word.  The origin.  Yeah.  Yes.  Our own black girl works on the Ron and Fez show.  He fancies himself part Cherokee Indian. 
[04:42:30]  Jeez.  Yeah, and I just read in the paper that the Cherokee Indians are throwing out all the blacks,  saying that they're not Cherokee anymore, because the way they got to be Cherokee was  they were actually slaves owned by the Indians, and the Cherokee Nation decided that they could  become Cherokees.  But the Indians own slaves, too?  Yes.  The Indians own slaves.  I didn't know that.  And they could then become Cherokee Indians.  And now recently, like right the day after Black History Month, the Cherokees got out 
[04:43:00]  of a little beating, a little powwow, and decided, get the blacks out.  We don't want them anyway.  Beat it.  So they're not entitled to any of the privileges that the Indians...  Yeah.  No casinos for you.  No casinos.  You ever go to the casinos in Mohegans?  I never see an Indian.  They're black guys.  Yeah, there's a bunch of black guys.  Black guys for the projects.  They're running the joint.  I run this shit.  I'm Indian.  I'm fucking Apache, asshole.  What's your next question?  Shut up.  I doubled down on that. 
[04:43:30]  I need some money.  Joe from Illinois.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  How's it going this morning?  How do you do, Joe?  What up, Joe?  Uh, yeah, I was called to tell you, uh, they just took away the Illini's, uh, Chief Illina  Wig.  The what?  Yeah, they took away our mascot.  The Illini's, uh, University of Illinois basketball team, man.  Oh, yeah?  Good.  Yeah, they just took away their mascot.  Oh, fucking it.  Fuck the mascots of this fucking team.  No!  Who's next?  Exactly.  Chief Illina Wig.  Who is that?  Who is that?  Who is that?  Fuck you.  We've been enjoying the mascots all these years. 
[04:44:00]  Oh, I know.  I hate them.  There's him next to Philly for that.  You gotta stop it.  What was the Braves, uh, mascot?  Every time a homer was hit, he would kind of jump up.  Chief Nakahoma?  Uh, exactly.  Or is he from, uh, the other...  I don't know.  I want him back.  Chief Nakahoma.  How about this?  All right, how about this?  Let's get a...  Like, for the WNBA, how about Team Lippy?  And the fucking mascot is a woman with a fucking zipped up mouth and a black eye.  How about that?  Team Lippy.  Lippy.  Team Lippy.  Team dinner was late. 
[04:44:30]  You mean Team Licky?  No, Lippy.  I mean, fucking being punched in the mouth by her husband.  Yeah, well.  I want our mascots back.  But if you, you know, you say the Philly fanatic and stuff, they're gonna say that it's goofing  on retards or something.  Right, that's what I'm saying.  Because it acts retarded.  Who's next?  You can't.  You can't get rid of the mascots.  But it's not...  Save the mascots.  Mr. Matt, I could see being a Down Syndrome parody.  Big fucking waterhead.  Mr. Matt, big baseball-headed goof.  But Chief Waka-Hoo and all that shit, man.  Waka-Hoo.  I don't blame... 
[04:45:00]  They're just trying to have a little fun, Jimmy.  And what?  Now no fucking reruns of F Troop?  No.  Because of the fucking Hakawi Indians?  You don't remove...  They went, where the Hakawi...  Jim, are you dating an Indian woman?  Why?  I wish I was.  Because they have big pussies.  Do they?  The kid's like a papoose.  They carry their young in it.  Hey, you want the origin of the word?  Yes.  Give me the...  All right.  From Louis C.K.  Where a nigger came from?  Originally?  There was some black guy being a nigger.  And so they called him a nigger. 
[04:45:30]  Isn't it good for y'all to have to chop up a bunch of stuff?  And that's where it started.  It just was a...  Nigger was a feeling.  Yeah.  He's just like, this...  It wasn't just...  Yeah, it wasn't some wordplay.  He was just blurting out a sound and it came out like that.  Just the guy was being such a nigger.  That it fucking made someone say the word.  Fucking God.  Hey, Patrice was helping it along, too, there.  Jesus Christ.  He wasn't disagreeing, man.  He was being so serious, though, because we had just found out the definition of what 
[04:46:00]  word?  Of kike.  Yeah.  Of course, the Jewish slur.  And so Louie goes, you know what the definition or the origin of the word nigger is?  And we were like looking at him all like, what?  Like, wow, we want to know.  And he comes out with that.  And we're like, you fucking asshole.  I was buying this.  This is healthier.  The origin.  Yeah.  Origin.  Yeah.  I'd like a spelling bee.  Origin, please.  What's the matter, Opie? 
[04:46:30]  Sweetie.  This is the healthier version of the parfait.  Parfait.  I like a parfait.  But it's healthy.  Yeah.  If you don't like it, I'll get you the regular.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  The bottom part of that looks like the shoes of a sexually abused airline passenger.  Oh, thanks.  What is that?  Yeah, as I drink a smoothie.  Oh, he's got a little bleeding of the testicles.  Nah.  Yeah, Chief Nakahoma was the brave mascot.  Chief Nakahoma.  Nakahoma.  See, it sounds like an Indian, but it's Nakahome run. 
[04:47:00]  You get it, Jimmy?  Fucking awful.  You remember, they had, what was the wrestler?  Chief J. Strongbow.  Yes, yeah.  All of, you know, what about the wrestlers that have these names?  Yeah.  You know.  The Iron Sheik.  Yeah, the Iron Sheik.  It's a total fucking stereotype of a, you wore the curly fucking old shoes they haven't  worn in centuries.  He was terrific.  That guy was great.  Down with America.  Fucking guys.  Well, wrestlers are slightly different in that they all parody different. 
[04:47:30]  Every ethnicity kind of gets it.  But then again, you're right.  What's the mascot doing?  You don't see a Jew.  You don't see a Jew wrestler.  Here he is, you know.  Hyman the Banker.  You know, it's a naughty Jew with a big nose.  I'm going to out-wrestle you!  And all he does is send his lawyer out to sue the wrestler once he hits him.  Dude, how fucking great would that be?  That'd be a great gimmick.  Where's Vince?  Oh, he has his lawyer talking for me.  He's at the pay us and stuff.  Shadow boxing.  Yeah, he's like, shadow boxing, but never actually goes in the ring and does anything. 
[04:48:00]  His lawyer just serves papers to everyone in the ring.  Well, you know what?  That's what it is.  I think the Jewish folk never really get it like that.  Never.  Why?  Because we're scared of that.  You know what happens?  Because everyone's scared of that.  Well, because they run the media.  They have been through so much oppression and slavery.  Oh, wait a minute.  What are you talking to?  Well, Brando got in trouble because he was being interviewed.  And he goes, you know, Hollywood has never cartooned or parodied the kike. 
[04:48:30]  He said they have.  Wow.  He actually said it like that?  Yes, he did.  But he wasn't saying that to be racist.  What he was saying is that they've done like the Dago.  He said they've done every race, like blaxploitation movies or mafia movies, have taken the stereotype of an Italian as a guinea.  It's a mafia guy.  That's a stereotype of an Italian.  So he said they've never shown the kike, which is the parody of the Jew.  They just don't show you that in Hollywood.  Well, it was done in another country between the mid-30s to mid-40s.  A lot of cartoons, a lot of posters were put up parodying the Jewish person. 
[04:49:00]  Where?  Berlin.  Poland.  France.  You want me to expand?  In Iraq right now.  Hey, let's go to Bruce in Memphis.  Bruce!  Yeah, it's Rooster, not Bruce.  All right, Rooster.  What's up, Bruce?  You know, normally I absolutely love Jimmy, but I can't believe what a fucking hypocrite he's been.  Not being a hypocrite, dude.  First of all, why am I being a hypocrite?  Because you have defended people's right to talk about everybody. 
[04:49:30]  I am part Cherokee, and I think that the Cherokee Nation needs to rise up and have a little thicker skin about their names.  Let me say, I agree.  See, talking about anybody is different than cartooning them in it, and I'm not politically correct, but they are the only group that you're allowed to do that to.  It bugs them, and I think that they're right to be irritated by it.  If you did it with blacks, like, I think you should be able to talk about everybody, but you can't cartoon everybody in a mascot, can you? 
[04:50:00]  You can't do it with blacks, you can't do it with Jews, you can't do it in any other group where it's acceptable.  But we've proven the Indians are weak, so it doesn't matter.  Oh, no, no, yeah, exactly.  Believe me.  Why don't we just have them running around with an anthrax blanket on?  I mean, come on.  Yeah, we were the first terrorists.  Isn't it kind of cool, though, like, they're not naming a fucking, you know, weak piece of shit thing after an Indian.  They're naming, like, a fucking football team, man.  The Chiefs, like, you know.  Yeah, Kansas City Chiefs.  Yeah, it's like you want a name that shows energy and courage and bravery. 
[04:50:30]  That's why they picked the name.  I'm a hawk chop.  It's not the Kansas City Chief faggots.  Right.  It's like the fucking, you know.  It's like, I think it's kind of showing that they're powerful and kind of, you know.  Yeah, say that when it's 3 and 13, and fucking it's halftime.  I will give it to you that fans are idiots, and the mascots do have to look a little goofy.  They just run out.  I like the Tomahawk.  Although I believe the Redmen's mascot, wasn't that just a guy dressed like an Indian? 
[04:51:00]  Mm-hmm.  Like, legitimately, with the headdress and the makeup and stuff like that?  He was a warrior.  A warrior.  Like, it wasn't like the goofy, big-headed, fucking, you know, Mardi Gras float-head Indian.  How terrific.  How terrific.  Chief Nakahoma can fuck his mother.  Chief Nakahoma stinks.  He's a fucking clit.  Fucking hate Chief Nakahoma.  Hey, the man Nakahoma, didn't he? 
[04:51:30]  Fuck you.  You hate Chief Nakahoma.  You really do.  I would love them to say that he's HIV positive.  All right.  Chief Waste-Awea.  Can you please call up with other mascots?  Holy shit.  We got, we hit Jimmy's button today.  I'm Nakahoma.  I wish I could remember some more of these mascots.  I can't often.  I think a mascot touched him when he was a baby.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  You got the red skin.  Chief Nakahoma grabbed his fucking cock. 
[04:52:00]  Damn.  Nakahoma.  It was his first baseball game.  Yeah.  He went to the bathroom by himself.  Hey there, son.  You need a little help?  Put his tomahawk on your ball sack.  I'm Chief Nakahoma.  Yeah.  Come here.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Please.  We just don't have that knowledge right now.  Oh.  Yeah.  You got the Cleveland Indians. 
[04:52:30]  You know, they like naming their teams after their jobs.  I know.  Well, you know what?  They should.  Again, it's legal, but it should just be enough already.  Get over it.  Fucking change the name of your shit dick team.  What, are people not going to root for the Redskins?  People fucking root for the, when the fucking Colts moved and came back as a Ravens,  they rooted for them.  What the fuck?  What about the Cowboys?  Well, the Cowboys had the, it was, he had a black, it was a black guy who was dressed  as a cowboy.  Yes.  And I think he can.  It's a Philadelphia.  And they beat the shit out of him.  Of course they did.  Oh, they beat him.  It's like, what the fuck?  He had a cowboy shooting his gun. 
[04:53:00]  Yeah.  Oh, the black guy?  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, wait.  Why did they pick a black guy to be a cowboy in Dallas?  The mascot is a Nick.  What's that?  A Nick.  I said the mascot is a Nick.  Yeah, I never thought about that before.  A black cowboy in Dallas is a little strange.  Well, yeah.  We've been to Dallas a few times.  I'm surprised at that flow.  And that's through the years.  He's been there a long time.  I think he's dead, actually.  He got beat up in Philly?  Yeah, I think he was beaten. 
[04:53:30]  He was beaten pretty good in Philadelphia.  Philly is the worst.  Philly brothers are rough, man.  Between Santa Claus getting pegged with batteries.  Should fucking travel with a construction worker, a biker, and an Indian.  Philadelphia has the worst white guys you ever want to see.  It's got to be the worst white guys.  It is.  It's just awful.  What about the guys with the Philly beards?  They're like...  No, the long beards?  Yeah.  That's the...  Their problem.  No, no.  There's problems there, too.  The Philly white guys are the worst.  They're big. 
[04:54:00]  They're thick-necked.  These thick-necked white boys are the worst.  Boston white guys are...  They're number two.  Number two.  Yes.  Philly white guys are number one.  But at least in Boston, you know where you can go and where you can't go kind of a thing.  Right.  You know, you're not going to go fucking into Southie and just bust into a bar and go,  Hey, niggas, what's up?  You know?  Well, you know...  Like Philly, though.  I'm at the game, the Philadelphia Eagles game.  I'm a Cowboy fan.  And there's a guy walking through with just a Georgetown hat. 
[04:54:30]  They started blowing him and throwing beer on him.  He's like, This is Georgetown.  It's a basketball team.  We don't give a fuck.  Get out of here.  Animals.  They are animals.  You've got to love them.  Jesus Christ.  We love Philly.  Let's go to...  Yeah.  Let's go to William in Miami.  William, what's up?  Hello, guys.  Hello, Bill.  What's up?  Well, I was going to say, I'm part Seminole, and I'm down here in Florida.  And a lot of it has to do with pride.  We're actually proud to have these teams have our heritage as their symbols. 
[04:55:00]  It's nothing slanderous or offensive.  No, you're not.  Hey, let's...  Oh, really?  We are.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Let's figure out...  If it's Chief Nakahomo from Atlanta.  I hate him.  Well, how about the fucking...  How about the mascot for the Indians?  It's Chief Wahoo.  Wahoo.  That's his name.  Chief Wahoo.  And it's that big, round face.  Yeah.  Wahoo.  Wahoo.  That's good.  That's good culture.  Chief Wahoo.  All right.  Before we get off the air today, we've got to figure out the worst mascot. 
[04:55:30]  Because someone...  Good old Freddy.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  I forgot about this.  And I think we were up there when they debuted this.  The Red Sox mascot is awful.  What is it?  Oh, that thing is stupid.  The Green Monster.  The Green Monster.  Ew.  The Green Monster.  And his name is...  I forgot now.  Where are you?  Should be a shot pregnant woman.  Wally.  A shot pregnant woman.  Wally?  Wally.  He couldn't find a...  Guess for the name alone, he should be fired.  Wally.  That is no thought process.  The Green Monster.  I remember when they debuted him, the whole place just started booing. 
[04:56:00]  Like, what are you doing to our city?  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the new Boston Red Sox mascot, it's Wally, the Green Monster.  And you just heard, boo!  Go fuck yourself, you cocksucker!  Who the fuck is Wally?  Wally's a queer.  You're fucking queer.  You're fucking queer, Wally.  Go fuck Wally, your mother, your fucking mother.  Hey, Sully, Wally's a queer.  Sully, I'm going to lob this fucking bottle at the fucking monster's head. 
[04:56:30]  You're walking...  And I should have.  That's no thought process behind it.  No, no.  And Jim from Philly...  A wall.  Jim from Philly writes, Opie, we didn't throw batteries at Santa, we threw snowballs at  Santa, we threw batteries at J.D. Drew.  J.D. Drew.  That's right.  Who's that?  Baseball player.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was a baseball player for us.  And let's not forget the standing ovation after what's-his-name was paralyzed.  Michael Irvin.  Michael Irvin.  Shit.  Fucking brutal, man.  That's what gives Philly its fabric, its texture.  Yeah.  You just love to hear stuff like that from cities. 
[04:57:00]  Just mean people.  God damn.  Why don't you love that?  You have to love it.  I'm from Philly.  I've suffered all racism, all this race riots, and I still love it.  I just love Philly.  They're out of their fucking mind.  All right, let's go to...  They certainly are.  Adam's going to piss off a little Jimmy today.  Adam in Virginia.  Go ahead.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I've got a couple of them for you.  First off, the Atlanta Braves have Tommy Hawk and Homer D. Brave. 
[04:57:30]  Homer D. Brave.  How about the other one?  Maybe it could be a white guy and a mustache, husband of the communist cunt.  How about fucking Ted Turner throws that one in there?  And then the other one is the University of Georgia Bulldogs.  They have hairy dog.  Hairy dog.  Oh, like hairy, hairy dog.  But it's just...  Maybe you can have like an ultimate fighting mascot competition.  Have the last mascot standing. 
[04:58:00]  Just a bloody mascot just bashing.  You can give them weapons.  You know, Wahoo have his little...  Tomahawk.  Yeah, they have to have what they're equipped with.  With a Philly fanatic going to like tongue people to death with that stupid fucking party  favorite tongue that sticks out.  Oh, dude.  I want to smack him.  When he came into the studio when we were at YSP.  Oh, he smelled.  He smelled bad.  And he smelled so...  They can't figure out how to watch those mascot fucking uniforms.  And he's inside.  You don't see...  You just see the dopey face of the fanatic. 
[04:58:30]  And we're like, oh, fuck.  That stinks.  And he's like, look, guy.  I don't get to fucking watch this thing.  That's funny.  You don't have a way to watch these mascot outfits.  Look at the Philly fanatic.  You turn that around.  No, that's the green monster.  Let me see.  Ew.  Wally.  It looks like fucking Mayor Menino with a green head.  Big fat fucking head.  That's what the mascot should have been.  A big oversized tongue in a mayor's mouth.  Mascots fucking suck.  They don't help anything.  No, they don't fucking get anybody riled.  Oh, the mascot's getting us to cheer. 
[04:59:00]  Look, he's standing on the dugout.  No one fucking listens to them.  The mascot is fucking passe.  When guys wear fucking suits to baseball games, that's what a mascot was appropriate.  They're shit.  Colby and Anthony. </pre>
