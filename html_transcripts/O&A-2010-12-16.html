<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion about the Channel 7 New York weather girl who fabricated a rape claim, followed by a lengthy segment on the documentary *King of Kong*. This segment included a phone call from Billy Mitchell himself, along with his lawyer, Steve Sanders, who offered counter-narratives to the film's portrayal of Mitchell and his rivalry with Steve Wiebe in the competitive Donkey Kong scene.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, Sal Governale, and Danny, engaged in numerous tangents, including discussions of other reality TV shows like *Storage Wars*, and frequently used crude and offensive language.  A caller mentioned Billy Mitchell's daughter's appearance, and the hosts and guests debated the accuracy of *King of Kong*,  promising to air a full two-hour interview with Mitchell in a future show.

The show then shifted to a bizarre anecdote about a workout glove used to prevent "marble hand," before returning to the *King of Kong* debate with more phone calls.  The conversation then pivoted to the hosts' upcoming Foxwoods poker tournament, specifically their logistical challenges in arranging transportation and accommodations for guest Patrice, and their complaints about Sirius XM's perceived stinginess.

Studio guest Colin Quinn joined the conversation, discussing his Broadway show, encounters with Jerry Seinfeld at a Paul McCartney concert, and his impressions of various celebrities.  The discussion jumped to a video of a Sudanese woman being flogged for wearing pants, anecdotes about Long Island, and reminiscences about their high school experiences, including racial dynamics.  The conversation further veered into discussions of Ted Bundy, Joel Rifkin, and crime on Long Island.  Adrian LeBlanc was mentioned as a scheduled, but absent, guest.  The overall tone remained irreverent and frequently employed offensive language.

Another segment with Colin Quinn featured a graphic discussion of Ted Bundyâ€™s crimes, which transitioned to Quinn's movie project and location scouting on Long Island, including discussions of OTB parlors, gambling anecdotes involving racist and antisemitic slurs, and frustrations with New York state's finances.  The conversation touched on upcoming tax legislation and the estate tax, before abruptly shifting to a call from a supposed journalism student seeking advice from Larry King.  The hosts then discussed Roman Polanski, Michael Jackson, and a bizarre anecdote involving handcuffs and a demand for sex.

A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to Penthouse Pet of the Year, Nikki Benz.  This segment contained sexually explicit conversations detailing Benz's experiences in the adult film industry, including graphic descriptions of her first anal scene and other sexual acts, along with detailed discussions of her personal life, sexual preferences, and those of her listeners.  The hosts and Benz engaged in suggestive and sexually explicit banter, mentioning specific porn actors like Rocco Siffredi and Lex Steele, and providing detailed descriptions of sexual acts and preferences, including comments on genitalia size and shape. A detailed discussion about a broken penis,  safe sex practices, and preferences regarding body hair also occurred.  The conversation also touched upon Colin Quinn's comedic act and his alter ego, Chip, and an upcoming appearance at Foxwoods. The segment concluded with promotional plugs and a humorous reference to a previous on-air spanking of a staff member, Roland, by Benz with a belt.  The show throughout maintained its characteristically erratic and tangent-filled style.

[00:01:00]  about billy mitchell in a second to start the show today but first uh oh dan what are you doing there  what was that about dan he took his shirt on his sweatshirt off and his his t-shirt pulled up  we saw the dan bod put your shirt back on yes dan did you guys see my ab i saw your ab we did see  an ab it needs friends hey we got um we got a lot of creepy stories in new york yeah really quickly 
[00:01:30]  long island's getting all creepy oh fuck that we'll get to that in a second and the joel rifkin  interview which uh made anthony and i laugh hard oh fucking people because it proves our theory but  first uh we want to talk about this weather girl uh the channel seven weather girl here in new york  city i'm just creeped out by this yeah yeah she um and there's the word like i told you  betrayed betrayed the people she works for and with are jackasses yeah you got a girl she's a weather 
[00:02:00]  girl at channel seven here in new york and uh she comes into work one day and basically tells everybody  that she was almost raped as she was um uh jogging in central park yeah which is so hacked by the way  it is hack these days if you're going to claim rape you can't say it was in central park jogging the  cops will be on to you immediately it's not the 70s anymore and and they and they said as soon as they  heard her story they were on to her immediately they were just kind of sitting back and waiting for 
[00:02:30]  her story uh her story to fall apart right know that shit but basically the story goes that a  hispanic man dragged her into the woods while she was jogging uh attempted to rape her and then two  people saved her they saw the whole thing happen and they went and saved her and then what just left  and then the two people left they didn't report it okay she sort of reported like a month later or  something like that and then she claims that on november 21 uh which is uh about two months later i believe 
[00:03:00]  that the the same rapist guy approached her the same guy what a coincidence the same guy approached  her i don't know where i don't i don't i'm not sure if they say where central park times square i don't  know the seedy area yeah the seedy areas of course and uh then she finally had to admit that it was all  a bunch of lies that she was going through some tough times personally i guess and she felt the pressure  of of her professional uh life her personal life and she made up all this to get some sympathy right 
[00:03:30]  whoops so channel seven went what the fuck and they uh have suspended her they removed her from  the website but now they popped her back on the website late last night i guess oh they did uh there  was a huge post of her at channel seven they yanked that down that's gone and uh what bothers me  is uh this it was an outrageous lie said a fuming wabc staffer who like others were flabbergasted to 
[00:04:00]  learn of the deception by reading about it in the post all this trust we had is shattered  shattered we're like a family we feel betrayed oh god it's not about you assholes here's the head  of the network liar liar liar you know it it's not about you if this chick is making it making up a  story where she was possibly raped or almost raped yeah she's got some serious issues going on in her 
[00:04:30]  head perhaps some some mental problems yeah so if you're one big family at abc what you should be  saying is oh my god i feel bad for her i feel sorry for her obviously rape is not something that  should be taken rightly or reported like what we do sympathize with uh her problems that have led  her to bloody block yeah they could do that instead of just betrayed i hope she gets uh the help she  needs that type of thing now don't don't be mistaken we're not saying we would do this either but for 
[00:05:00]  these news people if that story happened here i'd be really creeped out i would certainly not be  insane my trust has been shattered shattered has been shattered we're like a family we feel betrayed  really yeah you're a fucking dope i would love to know which guy said this it's probably a woman  actually i would assume it's a woman i just got that hunch i'm sorry yeah but i i assumed that  so unbelievable they just uh like uh scorning her exiling her scorning her yeah obviously she has 
[00:05:30]  some some issues whether they're mental or not i don't know i'm i'm not here to say i have no idea  but obviously some deep issues yeah so you're not family if you're if you're yelling screaming uh  betrayal at all yeah you know you and uh to be a girl that cried rape oh ouch it certainly opens  you up for some sexual assaults without any repercussions for the gentleman it really does  it's like a she's got a yeah a rep now that she did this because victims have to be squeaky clean 
[00:06:00]  in court yeah so now you you have a you have a almost a free shot at this one free shot and then  you get you get dragged into court it's like hey judge we all know that she made this up in the past  judge come on look she betrayed her entire staff they said it themselves  yeah can you convict someone if she actually got raped now no way the guy would walk i really  believe you're right got free i really as long as she better just lock herself in her fucking house 
[00:06:30]  right uh i remember her you remember her right we've seen her a million fucking times on tv  weather gal weather gal firestorm friends at channel 7 betrayed by rape lie betrayed  assholes betray the staff stupid assholes thinking about themselves all the time right clam up you  she's got emotional problems yeah i remember her sure yeah well look at her stand in front of the  fucking weather map you fool uh and uh james in missouri james james yeah i was listening to 
[00:07:00]  making killer yesterday on fox news and they were talking uh possible jail time for this girl for  lying about that well it is you know well they always reporting yeah they always say uh what the crime  is uh i think she could get up to a year in jail she'll never see a year in jail no she'll get some  kind of community service yeah what what she gets is uh her career shattered is what she gets yeah  so i couldn't hear yeah i was gonna say i was disappointed that it wasn't uh jill nicolini 
[00:07:30]  instead of uh god forbid sir god why would you say such a thing anthony's on good terms with his ex  she's uh she's a fine gal there you go that's terrible you would even say anything like that  all right hey the fiery redhead from the subway incident yes what about her she got a show honored  for bravery oh really woman honored for bravery i thought she got a show on fucking a and e or 
[00:08:00]  something no that's the christ we call her the fiery redhead that that was really pissed off  because that guy exposed himself on the subway yeah uh she's probably she'll probably get some  kind of reality thing going for herself you think i'm yeah i'm i'm really good like i was tired of  reality shows but now uh there's a whole new fucking wave coming in you're back in right not really you  gotta be back in dude when it gets to storage locker auction wars i am like i am like wait is that  a title of a show yeah and there's a couple of them i'm loving storage wars don't do it it's like a 
[00:08:30]  game show and an auction show and a junk picker show it's like one it's uh uh i don't even know  how to describe it what what's that old game show like door number one let's make a deal and pawn stars  at the same time door number one door number two oh you got zonked do they even know what's in these  storage units they get like they get to open like they open the storage unit and then you get to look  you get a peek so you get to like have a flashlight but you can't open boxes you can't step inside the 
[00:09:00]  storage unit so all you see is like these drawers and boxes and bullshit and you have to decide  whether or not hey is that worth it for me based on the book's cover you gotta guess if it's a good  book or not you know what i mean what so you peek around what channel is this on uh that one yes i  do believe this is a and a storage wars fuck i didn't even know this was going on you just started  watching let's open a storage compartment i put this on for two seconds i'm like this is going to be 
[00:09:30]  the dumbest fucking thing in the world i watched two full episodes nice now i will you pick storage  locker number three i'll tell you what if you have a paper clip in your purse you could trade it for a  thousand dollars and the storage locker what do you want to do trade it trade it  that show was terrible trip everyone dressed up like stupid idiots but are they finding anything of  value yes they are yeah yeah yeah they are so this is uh this is kind of like the american pickers  it's it's a whole bunch of shit all piled into one with the little hoarders thrown in you get some 
[00:10:00]  flavor right yeah you get some hoarders because the people that had these lockers it's apparently  people that had rented lockers stored their shit in it and then either fucking left died wherever  the fuck they just never paid their bill yeah it happened to a parasol a few years back and that's  how some uh some photos got out but same thing you know just defaulted on a storage unit so people uh  and then they auction them off to people it's fucked up and some people get some good shit  but uh with all these shows that are coming out i i'm really there's one thing that really 
[00:10:30]  annoys me with all of them the promos at the end they all have to cross their arms and look at the  camera now this kind of started i think with um with uh i'll say american chopper i'll say american  chopper yes it's had a start with american chopper and uh maybe actually even dog the bounty hunter  or fucking uh you know tough guy things but now every show has to have their arms folded and storage 
[00:11:00]  wars and you see them like three guys and they all cross their arms and look at the camera hey i don't  get it even like the little pussy guys from american pickers are doing it mythbusters and they're kind  of fruity and mythbusters are fruity they're gay right this is doing it yeah those guys are gay  to be married of course they're gay no they're just nerves no they're gay they're not gay though  they're don't ever call the mythbusters guys gay why because they're not they're about the  gentlemen who could pull off a beret unless you're gay danny oh sorry voss

[00:15:30]  shots i watch that show and stuff and it's just two delis we're supposed to film this and they're  talking about yeah and they're just kind of like you know one guy's like guy came in he asked for  ham and swiss on a hero with uh mustard you know bobby put mayonnaise on and then they show  they show bobby and and he's all confused and then the guy the boss has to yell at him  and shit and apologize to the customer the promo could after break somebody might burn themselves  on the hot but then skonk deli war and it's done so dramatically but but it's just the deli don't

[00:17:00]  fucking film this who has a deli we could use who's got a deli on long island we're filming this  yeah we need deli wars maybe it needs to be done in jersey or brooklyn because middle america will  love those thick accents yes you gotta have those accents long island accents brutal yeah it really  is the country needs to hear the long island accent long island has very specific delis they're not  like new york delis like new york delis has like you know famous delis and and and they're very 
[00:17:30]  no we're talking about delis is you know we're talking about uh just a basic down and dirty deli  yep that is that thinks they're more than they really are i got the backstory on this whole show  of course i'm ready it's great i'm ready to go i'm ready yeah that's a great deli right there look  at that it's the best yeah there you go i like delis though in a strip mall kind of environment  strip stores those are good hey uh while we have uh salmon here and uh and danny we have to talk 
[00:18:00]  about billy mitchell once again billy speaking of now who are great at things before we start this  remember there are people out there that have not seen king of kong i find that hard to believe yeah  me too so we're gonna have to really spoon feed this for the people wait you mean we've not seen king  of kong who have not seen king of kong 30 times yes king of kong is one of the greatest  movies ever made yes it truly is but it's right up there don't call it a documentary in front of  mr mitchell oh really no uh mr mitchell was pretty much the star of king of kong king of kong uh danny 
[00:18:30]  you want to explain the movie for everybody that has have not seen it sure basically it follows um  a man named steve weeb who is whatever who's trying to from seattle who's trying to uh conquer the  donkey kong title which billy mitchell has held held and had held for something like  20 years many many years yes donkey kong jr is a little side story so it's a little side 
[00:19:00]  steve weeby goes on his big quest to to topple the king billy mitchell and king of kong uh just takes  a look at the whole culture of these fucking video game still throwing quarters in these dumb gaming  machines and not not platform games or a pc game uh the culture it is school arcade game culture  that you would think this is a huge thing with how they present it i mean they're going state to state  there there are people whose entire lives are dedicated to these fucking games well once donkey 
[00:19:30]  kong came out they were done adapting to the technology that was it that i'm not going to advance  after this that was the highest level they could reach yes so uh sam got a coup uh billy mitchell  who doesn't do a lot not brian coup billy mitchell who's part of the movie too uh well the thing is  how did you guys get billy mitchell because he used to hang up on east side dave he sells hot sauce for  that's his job ricky's hot sauce why would he sell hot sauce if he's because he's the greatest video game 
[00:20:00]  player he's the greatest hot sauce guy he's great who has the billy mitchell tattoo me no i have no  idea that is billy mitchell that is a horrible tat man it doesn't even look like billy mitchell could  be the douche there's so many things that are wrong with this doesn't look like um well he doesn't  hold the record anymore so like it's like having like a bronze medalist tattooed on you and there's  like a little on like underneath billy mitchell's bust it says perfection and then under that perfection 
[00:20:30]  banner it's donkey kong and the princess but what doesn't make any sense here is that donkey kong  seems to be throwing the princess away and not a barrel he's in that position where he's rolling  the barrel but it's right in front of the princess yeah and the only thing that can make that better  is if perfection was felt wrong coke logic billy mitchell's not a nerd he's a goddamn champion thank  you and coke logic got to speak to the man on the phone oh really oh yes billy mitchell by the way  holds the live donkey kong record to this day steve weeby has the tape score i do 
[00:21:00]  believe that he's the only man to actually play a perfect game of pac-man oh yes oh yes power  pellets all energizers every ghost so and what you see in the king of kong you got you got people  that have uh the records for all these games and they and they got bragging rights so basically like  uh a little over two years ago uh east side dave got drunk and and found where he could order some  ricky's hot sauce and called up and ordered a bunch of it uh the next morning he was sober and 
[00:21:30]  billy mitchell made the huge mistake of calling east side dave back on his personal cell phone  huge mistake yes and now east side dave billy he's going is this billy mitchell yes this is billy uh you  know you ordered some hot sauce i fucking love you billy and so like i'd say when i think it was  the third special delivery show ever we were still taping shows at that point and dave goes 
[00:22:00]  hey we should call billy mitchell and i said you can get billy mitchell on the phone  i don't know let's try and we called him and pestered him and actually got him on the phone we  had no experience doing a show together just convinced him is this your last show no no no  this was two years ago oh because it sounded like you still have no experience on a show  or any business to be doing a show but we've been doing it every week for okay a year and a half now  on this channel you think it would get better i would think so um so we've been calling him 
[00:22:30]  progressively throughout our careers and growing with billy very lovely sometimes on the air and  many times dave calls him not on the air just to call him just to call him because he can but more  recently something changed with billy mitchell and he started calling dave whoa now what is that  about we weren't sure he started like dave called me once and he goes dude last night i got a voicemail  from billy mitchell and he was just calling to talk did he did he did he play the voicemail tip for you 
[00:23:00]  i've heard it and it's it's a little weird it's kind of dark it's like billy mitchell seemed like  he was in like a lonely spot and he needed somebody that was there i think he probably needs people  around him to inflate the ego i would love to know if he was like i could picture him sitting in a dark  room like just watching his old donkey kong tapes the flicker the tv light you hear in the background  of the message the gentle cling clang of ice in a bourbon glass and he's just fucking calling east side 
[00:23:30]  dave because i mean every time he talks to me and dave it's just you know chanting about how great he  is and screaming billy mitchell it just it's as if the biggest star in the world so well as if and he  is and so uh we get to this set or last saturday and i wasn't going to do the show because i was in  philadelphia for a wrestling thing and dave called billy mitchell to say hey i'm doing the show i'm just  going to play best ofs and stuff i just get billy mitchell to call in for a couple minutes  and he called him and he said hey billy would you have a chance to come on the air for a little bit 
[00:24:00]  this weekend and billy goes how'd you know i was here oh shit and then dave goes how did i know you  were where i just called your cell phone right and billy goes oh let me call you back oh so he realized  and so billy mitchell actually at that point started talking to dave changed his travel plans because he  was coming into town and got in earlier because he said i'm gonna come in the studio i'm gonna i'm 
[00:24:30]  gonna do it live and was that just insane and dave goes okay and then billy mitchell goes how crazy  do you want to get oh shit and dave goes billy mitchell could get pretty crazy dave goes billy you  don't know i'll get crazy yeah he don't know dave then he thought he's gonna be you know bringing  vodka and like just going nuts and billy says you want me to bring a donkey kong machine that's  fucking that's billy mitchell crazy and this was saturday morning yeah show's saturday night you 
[00:25:00]  want me to bring a donkey kong machine and so dave goes yeah and he goes okay so he gets off the phone  and so that morning dave calls me he's like sam you gotta come in you can't you can't go to the  wrestling thing i go well the wrestling thing is in the afternoon so just hold him off oh shit i could  get there by 10 o'clock i'll bet just hold him off for an hour just do the show without me for an  hour and we'll do it and he goes okay so i had to jet out from philly we couldn't get the donkey kong  machine up here but we tried every we called the building security wouldn't allow it up which is  such a shame donkey kong because he is the king of kong because it wouldn't fit through the metal 
[00:25:30]  detector don't just lift it it's a fucking donkey kong machine and billy mitchell isn't a terrorist  well that's what that boy wears an american tie for christ's sake i said his initials are usa on a  video game yeah but he uh they said they would have had to get specialists in here to take apart  the machine oh my god and inspect it for bombs this world's getting weird did they have to hook up some  kind of a special power source to wheel it across the street i remember of course so uh so you didn't 
[00:26:00]  get the donkey kong machine but you got billy mitchell on your show and steve sanders by the way  who's steve sanders who's steve sanders i forgot who's steve sanders billy mitchell's best friend  slash attorney oh okay you're about to hear probably the douchiest guy alive i disagree and he was  disproving a lot of what happened in king of kong king of kong painted billy mitchell out to be a guy  who was afraid of steve weeby who didn't want to defend his score in public who had this army of 
[00:26:30]  people around him that was hiding the truth and all of that is just creative editing all right  let's incorrect let's get it uh going billy mitchell explains king of kong on special delivery  with sam and dave billy hasn't seen king of kong is the first clip here because don't you think  that steve weeby's drawing sucked i mean but that darth vader was retarded i didn't see the movie so  i don't know you're bigger than the movie he's trying to say he's never seen the movie shut the 
[00:27:00]  fuck up do you think there's one thing that billy mitchell has been in or involved with that he hasn't  seen a thousand times he's never seen that or chasing ghosts he said he is so full of shite  what liar why wouldn't he now does he explain why he hasn't yeah of course he does prime time sam  roberts is there with the follow-up real fast darren in canada go ahead yeah uh having the high  score on one of those games is kind of like having the lowest t-cell count in the aids ward 
[00:27:30]  either way you're still a fucking loser oh you're losing sir have you ever been in life  magazine sir life magazine yeah billy mitchell has never seen king of kong bigger than the movie  at this point high road high road billy over here i've been trying to trick him and see if he  answers wrong and proves that he has richie in the movie he's lying no he's spotless why haven't  you seen the movie well the truth of the matter is they were supposed to send me a copy right when  we came to an agreement okay weren't they mr sanders yes they were steve sanders says yes okay so 
[00:28:00]  your actual lawyer well he was for that okay i don't trust him on anything else okay okay but anyway  the truth of the matter the truth of the matter is they didn't send the movie and i was really  annoyed that they didn't send it and then the little festivals that they had the closest the  movie ever came to me was like 200 miles what i'm going to drive and see the movie and so the fact  of the matter is i kind of got annoyed can i stop this for a second yeah yeah if you're in a movie  yeah god i dream of being in a movie and they're showing you 200 miles away i'm fucking jumping in my 
[00:28:30]  car does brad pitt have to jump through hoops to see his latest film he certainly doesn't you could  do 200 fucking miles in just four hours but i'm less i might even you know something  i'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt on this whole fucking thing really but the fact is  the movie now is available in your living room netflix instance you could just get it it's not like  he's got to drive anywhere why hasn't he seen it now that it's available anywhere they bruised the 
[00:29:00]  ego he's not interested i would guess that he's seen the movie a hundred times of course he has  that's my guess he has not but every question i asked him about the movie he was able to reference  the specific scene i'm gonna drive and see the movie and so the fact of the matter is  i kind of got annoyed and so so i i didn't want to see it wait do you realize even though you haven't  seen it that the entire movie you know all joking aside you are the movie yeah i've become aware of  that now by watching the movie actually this time talking to bill i've become aware of that he knows 
[00:29:30]  he's the star but he's like you know what if you're not going to treat me like that fuck you and your  movie he's being literal he hasn't seen the movie he saw the dvd oh is that it i didn't know the actual  movie theater to say it so he's able to say he never saw the movie i saw the dvd i saw the home video  release thousand times well moving on you got uh steve and billy talking about the way the film affects  billy's legacy yeah because i thought that you know he's a donkey kong champion and they make 
[00:30:00]  him look like a horse's ass in this movie by the way someone's reminded me they uh show king of kong  on g4 all the fucking time yeah it's a popular movie and do you think he's ever thumbing through the  channels and doesn't and sees it and he's like oh let me get off of that yeah i won't stop and he  just sees himself and it's like no please that guy probably has and i'm sure you are aware by now  that they kind of paint you in a derogatory sense do you think that they didn't believe any of the 
[00:30:30]  good stuff just the bad stuff i'm really not that nice oh really no not at all but go ahead with  your question do you think that they uh have they besmirched your legacy in the sense that they make  it seem like you have piles of of taped scores that may or may not be legitimate and that you  refuse to compete with people one-on-one do you feel like oh my gosh that's not true it's not  oh i'm sorry my attorney would like to answer go ahead yeah well that's not true well go ahead  steve no i mean billy always played head-to-head not in the movie i didn't yeah the movie said you 
[00:31:00]  didn't how does he know billy always played head-to-head did he have tape scores yes but  for submission never i've never submitted his tape as a score what was you saw the movie for example  when i for example i shellacked him in 1982 in life in life magazine in front of what was considered  to be 19 of the world's best video game player my friend was called that photograph was taken and  it was called the sergeant peppers of classic arcade yeah you know what i just saw chasing ghosts  come on oh my god come on see sergeant peppers of video games he doesn't submit tape scores he 
[00:31:30]  competes live yeah the movie makes it seem like he never competes live and how come he knows that  because he said the movie he heard about he's heard all about but he didn't say he heard he he that  kind of sounded like he saw the movie look at that you ever see this geek photo that is sergeant  these are these are the arcade champions arcade champs look at billy mitch with a mustache my favorite  thing about this is billy has a gigantic hickey on his neck in this photo yeah yeah and there's five 
[00:32:00]  of the most mediocre cheerleaders you're so right that is a horrible picture they're so mediocre you're  right danie are you team they might as well be waitresses in a diner somewhere like they just say here  put these cheerleading outfits on no one's gonna know is steve weeby in that picture  hell no because he wasn't he wasn't a part of this crew right he's a natural born loser that's  why he's not no that's why they hate him that's not part of their exactly and that's why he was  kind of isolated right he's not part of this fraternity what what games represent what arcade  games and i see a little uh we got donkey kong centipede yeah miss pacman defender yeah tempest 
[00:32:30]  tempest and i don't even know what they hated avoid spikes i don't even know what that is  avoid spikes stupid tempest danie are you team weeby i'm team no i i am team  i am team billy mitchell that's right you know he's the champion he is the champion you know that  has steve weeby ever played a perfect game of pac-man every pellet fuck no without losing a life  making it to all the way to the last no you know why because he loses everything he's ever done in  life he's lost wow all of it he's a loser he should probably get equal time on your program he can he's 
[00:33:00]  welcome anytime but he was in a band suck can i ask you something a perfect game with miss pac-man  can you do one better and and beat that record personally no i mean anybody i think a perfect  game is a perfect game you can't who knows sometimes a perfect game means you know then  you can do perfect game i think someone else could have a perfect game too yeah i think it's like saying  you can get 301 in bowling you know gotcha you can't so that record will never be that's it you 
[00:33:30]  could tie it be tied no someone does it faster than he did ah that's true is that possible i don't know  or maybe they get to a kill screen quicker i don't know uh steve screen if you're interested  talks about how the movie makes him and his friends look like billy's disciples  so a lot of you guys in that movie seemed very emotional over billy and the way he had impacted  your lives and everything how did you guys feel the way they portrayed you as sort of disciples of  billy mitchell in the film because a lot of people used words like douche chills and things like not 
[00:34:00]  us but they said things like yeah the truth of the matter is i just came from this guinness book  arcade uh contest yeah where richie knuckles richie knuckles where we have all of the guys that have  been competing for years and years and they're just billy's friends right that's just that's just it  they're billy's friends in fact when i when i uh as i'm their friend when i took when i showed the  t-shirt there at the arcade i was almost knifed there in the arcade are you serious wow not because 
[00:34:30]  they're really his disciples they're just his buddies okay well that brings me back because  i forgot about it brian coo claimed to be your protege or something brian coo said that yeah  in the movie i it never felt to me like you guys were ever that close was i wrong about that is he  really your protege are you he was just saying that he's like the he's trying to become the next  donkey kong champ danny who is brian coo and king of kong brian coo is the geeky well of course geeky 
[00:35:00]  but he's the guy that's running around the arcade asking people if they'd like to see the donkey kong  kill screen right uh he was a banker like some investment banker young guy young kid and i guess  he just made a ton of money really smart retired before he was 30 and decided that he was going to  retire and live his life within walking distance of fun spot fun which is an arcade in new hampshire  yes fun he said that every day he's just going to live his life he's going to eat a few pancakes  and some bacon strips and play some really good video games and then uh try to get excitement 
[00:35:30]  for the for somebody that's getting close to a kill screen and by the way there may be a brian  coo appearance in this studio on a saturday night in march all right make sure you say it on saturday  night you guys i didn't want you to think i was booking you are getting the a-listers that's right  of video gaming of this king of kong yeah right right a-listers of one  documentary of video games but we're the source you are billy explains his wife saying she's never  seen him compete head ahead okay that was in the movie this is a major scene wait what's that it's 
[00:36:00]  a shirt it's a brian coo shirt and what does it say it says there's a potential donkey kong kill  screen coming up if anyone is interested it's a picture of him it's a screen cap from yeah i'm  gonna get that and in march i'll come down to special delivery you're welcome and i will get a sign  that is why wouldn't you buy that shirt that is the best you gotta buy that shirt now the reason i  haven't yet is because it's kind of yellow and that's not my color i hate yellow shirts yeah this  is a key scene in the movie okay because the filmmaker is talking to billy mitchell's wife 
[00:36:30]  and says have you ever seen billy compete head-to-head his wife says no oh which leads  the audience to believe this motherfucker never competes head-to-head his his own wife sold  them out but why don't we put it into context context and that's what billy did okay and here's  why they tried to fool you the guy was speaking off mic so they put the subtitles have you ever  seen billy compete head-to-head if you listen closely i'm almost positive they say have you  ever seen billy get beat head-to-head and that's why your wife says never dave i gotta hear this clip 
[00:37:00]  you hear the clip right now have you ever seen your husband compete head-to-head in video games  it sounds like get beat never no is that does that sound like compete to you or is that get beat  listen all right well i have well i have my daughter kimberly here oh my billy mitchell's  daughter kimberly angelica's ever yes okay uh having have three kids my wife has never traveled with me 
[00:37:30]  anywhere video game competition related so how could she see i don't have any games at home  so i'll ask my daughter have you ever even seen me play video games nope never so there you have it  the thing is she has never seen him compete head-to-head why because she doesn't travel with  him ah but because we wouldn't want to we wouldn't want to abandon our three children and be neglectful  parents especially if one of them needed to be wiped of course oh shit oh damn what's up steve 
[00:38:00]  weeby face when does he practice he doesn't need practice he's the greatest i've never seen him  really when did muhammad ali practice when when he was 17 he doesn't need to practice anymore  importantly when did sinatra practice what does his daughter look like his daughter is actually hot  really very small no she's she doesn't do any he doesn't mean very small like she's it  she's petite how old is she she's 21 i believe because she just graduated college is she a  midget no she's like five foot even five foot but billy mitchell is six five how did that happen 
[00:38:30]  i don't know because his wife is five four that's wow because he has the nerd sperm that's not true  billy mitchell's not a nerd he's a winner he's a winner and that's the difference and by the way he  just cleared that up and that shot at steve weeby yeah was because if you remember in the film  steve weeby's getting his donkey kong record and his kid is yelling yeah daddy wipe my butt  and he's saying no and he's letting the kid get worms or whatever now how does he know that if he 
[00:39:00]  didn't see the movie once again he was probably told but why would someone tell him that like  well yeah it's steve sanders joke about it you would want to know the reference  firsthand if you're going to make a joke like that why didn't you call him out on it  i think you guys are getting lost on the point here steve sanders  i mean we're trying to disprove king of kong now billy mitchell right right right billy mitchell  was not on trial here no he was a guest in our home guest right billy is that how you treat a guest  no billy talks about mr awesome roy schilt and this is another who's uh mr awesome for the people 
[00:39:30]  that don't know what the fuck is going on mr awesome well danny who is mr awesome mr awesome  mr awesome from king of kong is a guy named like we said roy schilt now when steve i remember this  when steve weeby was going after his donkey kong record um he needed a donkey kong board now a board  is like the game it's like the cartridge what goes into a console or what used to go into a console  back in the day it's just a huge printed circuit board so uh he didn't have the money for a donkey  kong board so roy schilt who hates billy mitchell offered to buy steve a board because he knew 
[00:40:00]  that steve could take down or was hoping that steve could take down right billy mitchell they're not that  expensive are they um for original yeah they're probably a little pricey a little bit not too  bad but you know mr awesome has there's a picture of him with some fucking fat skank a mediocre skank  mediocre let's go with that word all day long just uh wrapped around him he's wearing a a dumb it looks 
[00:40:30]  like a post office workers hat uh he's giving the peace sign in front of his car which by the way  the license plate is m-r-a-w-e-s-m mr awesome don't forget about the lightning bolts believe me  the lamest lightning bolts you can have on your car it's an 80s version uh firebird and it's got it's  blue but it's got these white lightning bolts on them that look so lame it looks like stickers that  were cut out of some white fucking contact someone went to michael's and had a good day yeah yeah yeah 
[00:41:00]  and a giant a on the hood which you can either say is for awesome or make up your own a word which i  think you can put it in there but the a is in a lightning bolt font of course it is okay he's mr  awesome and mr awesome is a tool oh yeah he is yes he is and this is and the mediocre skank by the  way is wearing one of those suspender bathing suits like a borat bathing suit yeah exactly yeah it goes  from her uh her pussy and the best thing is he's got around her neck he's got this comic book thing 
[00:41:30]  that he sells or whatever and it's it's the title is mr awesome the comic book life of roy shill but  the best part is that there's a speech bubble above him yeah and in that whole picture that you just  described it says yo dude this could be you with the shitty fiber and the skanko wrapped around you  do they explain where he got his name from he named himself he just named himself he used to have  now you guys are really giving him you guys are giving him the business here but let's let's just 
[00:42:00]  bring it back together and hang on a second he held the missile command world record for a very long  time missile command fucking missile command wow okay that's pretty tough here this is a very  important character in king of kong and here's why because this is the reason why billy mitchell  doesn't like steve weeby and they don't really get into that enough in the movie the reason billy  mitchell doesn't want to associate with steve weeby is because steve weeby is associated with his  enemy roy shilt we all have people that if if they entered into somebody's life we don't want 
[00:42:30]  anything to do with them right right of course that's him for billy mitchell but they don't  really get into that they make billy mitchell billy mitchell's not scared of steve weeby no he  doesn't want anything to do with roy shilt but steve weeby is a very average uh person he's a very  normal very normal family man why would he be hanging with mr awesome yeah why would he be with mr  awesome i can see billy mitchell hanging with mr no billy mitchell would never hang with mr  awesome because they're both superheroes in their own minds steve weeby hangs with mr awesome because 
[00:43:00]  steve weeby is a loser and he thinks mr awesome's cool all right well here we go we got uh billy  talking about mr awesome let me ask you this question about uh i believe we need to talk about it  it's mr awesome roy shilt yeah who's with this guy he's a bit of a weirdo is that the case well i  met him in 85 okay and he was not in the original life magazine cover by the way correct and i haven't  had a conversation with him in 25 years yeah he's never so there is no rivalry strange man and the 
[00:43:30]  most i've said to him in 20 once i met him and i realized that he wasn't a guy for me to know um  the most i've said to him in 25 years i'll tell you the most i've said to him if you're ready  and i don't want to repeat so listen closely jared are you ready hold on hold on hold on one second  this is what i said to him in 25 years okay  it's nothing dave nothing he's about to speak no it was no that was it that was it that was the 
[00:44:00]  point it was hold on hold on hold on it's nothing dave it's nothing you can't just see it there you  go there you go hit the sound of truth even in silence so billy mitchell sounder would i i must add  quickly i miss the shit out of east side dave it's not every saturday i don't listen to your show  it's good i'm very busy the company has a way of letting talented people just go oh he's here  still no he's barely here he's here every week so you got another show that pumps it up there yeah 
[00:44:30]  well and the sam and dave show is a terrific show but it's only on a few hours every once in a while  he's got 90.5 tonight does dave have to get one of those clip-on temporary badges every time he  comes up no because they changed his status to part-time employee but there was a time where he  had to get the little i did have to put him in the system for a few weeks yeah he should be put in  the system that's for sure all right so we got billy mitchell from king of kong a terrific movie  on sam and dave and clearing up this whole thing billy talks about brian coo and perry rogers who 
[00:45:00]  this is who are those guys oh uh perry rogers if i recall perry rogers is another guy who can't  he's a gamer can't get late 1984 you know he probably he probably spends all day playing  mappy or some shit i don't know this was a huge point in the movie and oh i already forgot who's  brian coo again brian coo get his own t-shirt come on oh that guy yeah perry rogers doesn't have his 
[00:45:30]  own t-shirt you walked around i so don't give a shit about these assholes kill screen was coming up  this was a huge point in the movie because they said brian coo and perry rogers basically went to  steve weeby's house forced their way in and uh examined his board and that's and and destroyed  his whole score holy they made it seem like they broke into his house well they were spying the  movie they didn't really insinuate that they broke in but they did insinuate that um they were in the 
[00:46:00]  garage examining things without anybody's permission in the house that's what they said  in the movie right yeah because apparently steve weeby wasn't home and the only was he wiping his  kid's ass in the time no but the wife was home and the wife said i don't feel comfortable with you guys  here can you know come back when he's here and they just said whatever and did what they wanted  there wasn't a sexual assault was there allegedly that's what the movie says danny you ready to have  your mind blown fuck yeah oh shit did you send or know anything of twin galaxies sending or any of  your quote-unquote disciples sending people to steve weeby's house into his garage brian coo and perry 
[00:46:30]  rogers legendary gamer perry rogers good i am good richie knuckles perry rogers all around the  fucking movie sorry sorry all around great guy who would never how old are the children  the fact of the matter is i have to apologize the person who traveled about as much as me  yeah or about as much as walter go ahead was brian coo okay and brian coo was traveling and we're  going to go to ground control which is an equally popular arcade on the west coast as in new england 
[00:47:00]  with fun spot okay and he was going to go there with perry okay so he flew there and from there he  called and asked me if i had uh steve's number and i did sure i still do he and i had shared many  pleasant com or three pleasant conversations on the phone steve weeby and i each lasting more than  an hour long before any of this before the movie came out before any filming began okay and so i gave 
[00:47:30]  him the number and he spoke to uh steve's um wife and it was pre-arranged for them to be there at 2 30  and steve got there and he was late uh and the grandmother opened the garage and to let them play  donkey kong and she gave them a quarter because the machine was locked oh she okay the grandma  came home late stand you know changed his clothes he and brian played a game of donkey kong  together i don't know who won and they took pictures had handshakes congratulatory that's what 
[00:48:00]  happened when and both perry and brian said that's what happened having known the two of them  collectively for 35 years if either one of them lied to me it would be the first time  now at this point truthful steve weeby now acknowledges that that is what happened well  now when he acknowledges that it was awkward because he hadn't met these people but it was  friendly it was handshakes that's what i mean that's the truth of what happened wow these guys  take themselves way seriously wow holy shit now now that's a different story that could be the most 
[00:48:30]  boring story i've ever heard on the radio news and the post called to get the clip of that that  breaking news right there right uh did you give them the uh the audio so they could transcribe it  and put it in the paper i don't know where you got they actually haven't called oh for that clip  particularly what what's wrong they would have had to it's disproving the film it's huge that's why  i'm saying it's huge breaking news yeah bill explains why he stopped calling weeby because he mentioned 
[00:49:00]  that he had called in three times so i said wait a minute why how did this well if you got you know  if you're not a bad guy why did you stop calling him you said you had hour-long conversations with  steve weeby before filming and the movie started up on that because every time somebody got a score  uh from tim serby back in the year 2000 tim serby who had the world record i didn't have it  serbian tim serby who's the original one who took it was he in king of kong no no so who is this  guy exactly because king kong doesn't portray things accurately nobody the one who took it from 
[00:49:30]  me okay um and who was deserving to be in the king of kong and wasn't uh very much so he's a great  guy and a great player steve weeby i called him and congratulated him in 2000 i called steve weeby  and congratulated him also and i invited him to the classic gaming expo so i had three hour long  pleasant conversation why have there been no pleasant conversations with him since the phone  um basically i haven't called him because at one point when i realized that maybe there was a 
[00:50:00]  different agenda okay i just didn't have a reason to call him i had congratulated him so i stopped  calling and just sort of became more isolated i want to answer that too okay i'm gonna make it clear  here in the movie i say to the camera steve weeby you ought to just leave roy schilt behind yeah that  was really the issue billy's already said he doesn't talk to roy hasn't talked to roy and when  when it became obvious that steve weeby and roy had some kind of connection that's when billy stopped 
[00:50:30]  talking to steve weeby this is just unbelievable stuff i cannot believe you see that these motherfuckers  are so this sounds like 9-11 testimony like inquiry yeah this is like fucking jfk warren report  testimony it's a fucking video game we got to the bottom of it right here on the virus  you sure did you sure did there needs to be a new documentary made i think yeah the king 
[00:51:00]  of king of kong yeah and then we figure out who's just like who who's right and who's wrong yeah  finally the king of king of bed finally put it to bed all right well i got a lot of source material  right here i got something to say about this whole thing what's that  i don't care oh come on  i don't care my chokes don't go over i don't care  i don't care i don't care he does that dare i don't care i don't care he's still going you gotta 
[00:51:30]  he doesn't care i don't care it's insulting to billy mission i'm happy you're lucky women call me  pluck pluck plucky i don't care i don't care i don't he doesn't care listen and that goes on for  another two minutes you're lucky i stopped it there this king of kong story has been followed  on the ob and anthony show for the past two or three years now of course and we actually mentioned it  we are finally getting to the bottom of it uh billy talks about we be calling him 
[00:52:00]  that's right steve has called me twice regardless of what you see in the movie  magic billy now when he called me in the movie and he offered to challenge me he had a camera in his  face yes since then he has called me one time he's kind of like the andy dick of arcade game guys  i got the i got the call right on his phone the message that he left me and it was a very pleasant  message to the point that i just well how long ago less than a year ago and it was a very pleasant 
[00:52:30]  message to the point that i thought i kept it at the front of my phone i thought maybe i'll call  him but you never did no then g4 said to me well when did you last speak to steve and i go not in a  while and they said well he left you a message and i go yeah he did and they go we know he did it on  camera in front of us oh shit so the only so now the fact of the matter is i don't want to i don't  want to call just to answer a camera that's what he's doing no and there's probably a producer in  his ear telling him what to say to make billy mitchell out to look like the villain once again 
[00:53:00]  what is that he is not what is this sure i am what are you trying to change my image  yeah because why would billy mitchell want a camera you know or microphone or anything that's  going to be out in the because he's not that kind of guy his image gets skewed he's proven over the  years that he's not the kind of guy who will just thrust his face in front of a camera no or or  get in front of a microphone is he an ass jimmy's back complete ass yeah i walk in just as they're 
[00:53:30]  playing billy mitchell like he just sounds like an ass he is a complete ass but not as big an ass as  mr awesome he's very specific about the media outlets he goes to he's not just going to talk to  anybody with a camera or microphone dave show oh good point he's getting a lot of requests from the  media too but sam and dave got billy mitchell on their show and thank god we only have two clips  to go if you think fucking god so that makes us to 10 oh he takes himself way too serious if you  think these clips are probably the biggest douche walking the planet right now by the way the full 
[00:54:00]  interview was two hours long on special delivery two hours of this shite well east side dave also  played his uh son billy mitchell jr in pac-man so that was part of it that will all be re-aired on  christmas night on the virus thank god can't wait for the whole two hours and then the third hour  will probably be the first phone call that we had with billy mitchell so we're doing a billy mitchell  it's like a whole billy mitchell special yes christmas night that's very very smart well  deserved uh billy talks about the scene in king of kong we're almost done here folks where he goes to 
[00:54:30]  the arcade weebies in yeah and when he pulls up behind the restaurant you remember this danny  danny is is the expert on king of kong well i've seen this like a thousand times explain what he's  referencing um basically it's a scene that makes billy look like a puss it makes him look like he's  running away from uh steve weeb like they're eating at like a restaurant somewhere and uh billy pulls  up and then when he realizes that there's like a camera crew and he knows that it's going to make  him look bad no matter what he says right now so he just kind of pulls is that the dinner where  they got all the nerds together in one place for the movie but he didn't billy mitchell pulls up 
[00:55:00]  sees who's in the in the restaurant and says fuck this and leaves right yeah it's something like  that well that's what the movie portrays doesn't it yes maybe that's not what actually happened  what there was one scene in king of kong again yeah we got to get i want the truth out there for  everybody that's my motivation here wait he goes again because you had another question about king  of kong what else what else do you talk to this guy about hot sauce hot sauce he wanted to do  straight donkey kong talk not donkey you know just video game talk no one gives a fuck about donkey 
[00:55:30]  kong stupid he set the record gives a fuck  when you are when uh steve weeby is there and you see him and it looks like you kind of just make a  lap realize he's there and then walk out because you don't want anything to do with him well we  happen to have a film editing expert in the room here who was speaking to me about that scene on the  right here is that the guy with the camera that's the guy with the camera brent dolan well uh we were 
[00:56:00]  me and billy were in the car uh just driving in and i was telling him i said you know when he walks  into that room where steve turns around and says something to him you notice there's probably a good  five to six steps and these are billy mitchell steps by the way these aren't just regular people  this guy's like you know six five and there's two cameras on that on that shoot by the way  and you know the old cut so he cuts there and then there's five and all of a sudden he's way on 
[00:56:30]  the other side of them where he's just like you know he's gone well the truth is uh stepping one  or one bit before that yeah um everybody was in the restaurant and i walked in and again just to go  back and to show you what and how i have isolated my family from all of this sure um we were all there  and we were meeting steve sand yeah he means by we he's saying all the video game players were  there at his restaurant okay all right now all these people that i've known for 25 years not 
[00:57:00]  one of them has ever once met any member of my family whoa except me except so because he is the  lawyer no and me he had never met anybody until then and so now we pull up to the back and we're  going to a family function and we're going to go to dinner so rather than go and say steve let's go  i look out there and i see everybody 20 some odd people and i go yeah all right i go back to the  car and i say honey kids everybody we all walked in and that's the first time everybody met and we 
[00:57:30]  sat down at the i sat down at the table with steve weeby and they all walked in i didn't see wow i  mean is that in the director's cut or something i was there i saw it yeah what happened he pulled up to  the back of the restaurant listen please what happened there he pulled up to the back of the restaurant  yeah and then he walked into the restaurant you officially lost me too so he did walk in but  they didn't show that no they make it look like he drove away like a pussy but he didn't he just  drove to the parking lot and then he walked in with his family and that matters why because 
[00:58:00]  billy mitchell is not afraid of steve weeby ah steve weeby is a loser no one should be afraid of  any of these people ever really because they're just mr awesome really they're just video should we  be quaking in our boots at mr awesome what about brian coo he's brian coo he looks pretty scary  i mean he did retire at 30. uh you guys are forgetting all about mark alpager who is he oh  shit oh hello he's the guy that plays like crystal castles with his feet yeah he has a weight glove too 
[00:58:30]  yeah when you're playing marble you don't want it so when you're playing marble you don't want to get  marble hand no he calls it i just call it marble not more herbs herbs like you can call it marble  i just wanted to make sure you're a herb so he wears a workout glove so he doesn't get the marble  and he invented the work the glove for that oh yeah he just bought it but he goes but he sort of he  modified he's he found it he said you know what modified he took you know it's like you those  invention commercials like you know you can make an invention better so he decided hey i'm going to use  this for something that's not intended to yeah for use and you know what he's a genius play marble 
[00:59:00]  wow is he called it marble hand marble no just marble well james what do you call it when i'm  playing marble he puts it i probably puts it on and cups his balls and just goes in a circular motion  with his marble glove on on his balls let's uh let's go to larry king on line two larry wow  how important is the first hour of the show  ah shit let's go to palmer in jersey palmer 
[00:59:30]  come on this is stuff called from the sam and dave show right more importantly this is setting the  record straight on donkey kong and twin galaxies and king of kong and we got the last clip billy  explains what happened in the arcade what what what was that the big scene where uh we be trying to set  the record and and billy uh mitchell's kind of lurking around is that the scene right yeah and  it looks like he just walks out he just walks past steve uh steve weeby and then walks out because he 
[01:00:00]  doesn't want any part of it doesn't happen that way you're right does the name dwayne richards mean  anything to you dwayne richards yeah i think so do you remember what he is i think he's a guy  who plays like centipede or some other 80s thing like he's like i think he's the dig dug champion  dig dug no thanks oh oh oh is dwayne richards wait a second i know who dwayne richards is dwayne 
[01:00:30]  richards if i if i'm wait yes he's the nibbler champion nibbler he's the champion of nibbler  what do you mean what's nibbler nibbler dude nibbler is one of the greatest arcade games ever  in the world i don't think so it's a game about a um what is it it's like a worm thing it looks like  a pac-man ripoff i've never that's a pac-man ripoff yeah anthony's right it's like snake on your cell  phone oh you can't cross each thing you eat it makes you long your snake longer right and uh you 
[01:01:00]  got to kind of go through this maze and you can't cross your own yourself body there oh and he's  the nibbler champ but it's it's almost the exact pac-man board yeah what a guy dwayne richards  holds the record that nerd look at this fucking guy fuck well he's got to be into fucking fuck all  of these people not billy mitchell oh no oh there he is except people not gods or maybe you're right  deities was he arrested for something oh god does he look like a kid toucher okay anyway here's the 
[01:01:30]  final clip billy mitchell explains what happened in the arcade this is good so anyway so then we  all had dinner and we autographed books and it was the first time my son was ever asked for an  autograph incredible so i'll tell you one thing let's call up steve weeby so we signed everything  and then eventually it was time and we left we got to hang out so okay i had introduced my how many  things you think he signed that day oh my god well he's a giant star three probably i mean my wife  to everybody sure and then we went to drop steve back off at the arcade and i have my wife with me 
[01:02:00]  and she go i he and i wasn't going to go in and she goes you don't want to go in i go it's okay  again she's not a video game person right she goes no it's okay we can go and i go you don't mind she  goes no and i family on the phone i said steve we're coming in so we came in and right at the door  ed cunningham was there waiting and he miked us up and that was the very first row of games we went  down steve was there and we stopped and i stood behind him because i know during donkey kong when  you can talk to somebody and not mess them up sure and i waited and then eventually i saw where he was 
[01:02:30]  jumping on the monkey's foot and i said to him you know something like how they treat me so not good  and he says i just can't get it together i go i never saw i never saw that exchange real quick  there was a monkey at the restaurant no no no he skipped he skipped to the arcade scene  he's in the arcade now yeah he's playing don't pay attention sam that's dave no i'm dave okay  pay attention so you don't even know there's a monkey so so what happened was i stopped and i i said 
[01:03:00]  i said to my wife i says you remember him he's the other donkey kong player you met in a restaurant  she goes yeah and i said okay hang in there and i walked away and to be honest i'm really disappointed  during all this time period yeah that steve weeby would say that i didn't stop and i didn't speak  to him and i didn't snub him i mean i am i'm just me off a guy that i had friendly conversation with  i'm disappointed that he wouldn't say otherwise who gives a fuck who fucking cares god he does me and 
[01:03:30]  steve weeby ate fucking an omelet together yes he cares way too much that wouldn't happen about his  own uh it's awful but this guy it's nonsense well now everybody can finally go back and watch king of  kong again and maybe think with this now things are not yeah as they seem i don't think we learned  anything right there what are you talking about did you listen to the clips or no i sort of listened  you were not listening with your full attention i just felt like it was an opportunity to check my  twitter for the last hour all right well yeah that's kind of like when you're driving and you know 
[01:04:00]  you can check uh some shit on your phone yeah you're on cruise control and you know you're all  right we can play the clips again that's all right no all right i'll catch it during the replay that i'll  have chopped up to bits first hour of the show might sound very different during the replay no  the conspiracy needs to end here we need to remain intact with this absolutely yeah so where are we  where are we at with this record for king of kong uh donkey kong well steve weeby holds the taped record 
[01:04:30]  for whatever it's worth but philly mitchell has the live record which is much more important  controversy and that's as of september 20th of this year yeah steve weeby is now the world record  holder at 1 million 64 500 with a tape score a lot of donkey kong action in the latter part of 2010  yeah how high does this game go because there's a there's a kill screen so how do you get higher than  that well you they just keep trying to sneak in whatever however many extra thousand points they can  before their kill screen comes right yeah it's like it's a you just have to jump more barrels 
[01:05:00]  just stay in the game a little longer yeah there's ways to do it you could sit there and jump barrels  all day if you wanted to so why don't they do that on the first board well i don't know i never made it  that far well not i mean i've made it to the first board more importantly though really honestly who gives  a shit i would think a lot of people do and especially the billy mitchell i'm gonna back  you up jay in virginia does give a shit uh jay yeah go ahead jay this is the worst shit i've ever heard 
[01:05:30]  oh the roses is so bad oh well that didn't  the worst shit he's ever heard he tricked me sam i thought that was a positive call i'm sorry  well can we go to some of the other callers who want to talk about this i would love to sam but  jay's the only person that has called in the last 45 minutes and jay you couldn't have been more  pleasant yeah i had to switch radio stations it was so bad wow there is another call coming in 
[01:06:00]  finally finally i think we officially have had three phone calls since we started the show  very hot topic i want to thank sam for this let's say hi to josh in north carolina replay will be  josh what are we going to talk about next napoleon dynamite please get to a point oh boy yeah what's  your point sam we don't even know what the point is well because you you and anthony have said for  many days and years that billy mitchell is a douche and this was kind of me proving that he is not 
[01:06:30]  whoa did that not come across whoa this guy is very full of himself who billy mitchell yeah oh man  all right i guess that's uh that's it thank god i mean yeah moving on to napoleon dynamite  did you know that uncle rico was actually a vegetarian he spit out that steak wow yeah yeah  no one chucked that steak at napoleon anybody calling about that  well no but we got john in jersey uh john hey uh i just want to say thank you guys for the last 
[01:07:00]  hour of audible rape audible rape wow wow you feel like yeah you weren't entertained in the last  hour by the billy mitchell stuff i think he's feeling something was forced into his ears against  his will is that what he's it's like an audio rape yes yeah yes all right thank you sir i'm gonna go  on to cody in uh wisconsin cody hey guys i just tuned in about a half hour ago i was wondering if i  missed something yesterday is this the last show before you guys go on vacation linger longer yeah it

[01:10:30]  excitement is in the air it certainly is you'll be heading uh heading up there after the show tomorrow  right yep for the big uh the big uh poker tournament big extravaganza tomorrow um i don't  know are there still seats available or they're kind of taking as many as uh they want yeah i don't  know they took more than they were going to yeah definitely oh that's exciting they went over the uh  they went over the the limit how many how many people i'm not sure what it is now but i know the  limit was something like a hundred at first so and they've they've extended that oh that's that's 
[01:11:00]  great just go to foxwoods.com um use the keyword anthony in lowercase all in lowercase okay yeah  we lost uh bob feller over uh overnight poor little feller hall of fame uh pitcher there bob  feller and world war ii hero yes 92 years old died of acute leukemia that's where you go under  the chin as you drop sugar sugar sugar sugar sugar poor bob feller oh what a life though huh ah what 
[01:11:30]  a life do i have a nice room what happened okay rooms that where for foxville making sure that i'm  yeah good not in the old place there's another issue that it's all good has to be resolved is there  of course there is what there's always something i'll say it yeah patrice patrice handed his check back  yesterday like patrice is supposed to go i want patrice there patrice is fun yeah sitting at a  blackjack table while patrice just lambast the dealer is it's every blackjack player's dream to 
[01:12:00]  have someone like that around yeah i am personally taking care of my own room through keith and through  uh foxwoods because i have a relationship with foxwoods so i can go there and get hooked up with  the room and everything and i've told the management here yeah that i don't need a room  don't worry about it i'll take care of it transportation can i jump in hold on what  no i know what you're gonna say you're going for free basically sirius xm doesn't have to worry about 
[01:12:30]  your best right transportation same thing i don't need them to drive me there i have my own  transportation i i through the casino so you're not there a lot you're not costing sirius xm a dime  it is anthony cumia will be there completely free of charge to sirius xm radio yet they won't come up  with money to give patrice a ride up there like like patrice doesn't want to drive the fuck up there 
[01:13:00]  and and they're getting me completely free i'm not costing them a dime yet they won't come up with  the money for fucking patrice to get a goddamn ride from here up there so patrice just handed  the check because they were giving him the check i guess in advance like here you go here's and he  goes yeah why don't you hold on to that until you know we figure things out or whatever until you know 
[01:13:30]  and patrice isn't like uh other people he's not gonna budge if he doesn't know if he doesn't get  a ride up to foxwoods he's not going so he gave him back the check and said look you keep this  i'm not i'm basically not going unless you give me uh what's taken care of what's the latest on this  dan well i was i was in the bathroom so i didn't hear any of this stuff but uh but does patrice have  a ride to foxwoods now now he is all good he's all good yeah we were we were we spoke for the majority  of the day okay now even that i should i like now you hear that and i should go like oh then i'm so 
[01:14:00]  sorry i'm sorry this never should have even been an issue that had to be taken care of this is  something that they should have just said oh patrice is giving his time to go up there and  shit and i'm sure you know they're not giving him a fortune that's for sure uh to go up there you take  care of the people and don't be penny wise and dollar foolish uh if i'm fucking not costing you dime  a fucking one then take the money that it would have cost to get me up there and get my room and all 
[01:14:30]  that happy horse shit and and use it to take care of my guests for this fucking appearance so it's  they don't understand it's like i worked for a copper company i say copper  yeah we without copper the field of a girl oh no copper feel i was uh and i remember the uh they  wanted they were really cheap and i remember the district manager was in and he said we're a lean burn 
[01:15:00]  company lean we're a lean burn don't and that attitude like if you have people traveling for  you and you don't take care of them people after a certain point in their career will go all right  fuck the gig i'm not doing it yeah patrice is not bluffing he wouldn't do the gig no he just  wouldn't need the money i think he's not paying him what he probably makes for a  fucking a weekend performing he's going to hang out because he's a nice guy and he's not a nice guy  i love patrice but he likes to hang out yeah but you're not gonna get him you're not gonna 
[01:15:30]  if you're not giving him full weekend money yeah you know you can't you can't skimp on this shit no  you can't treat a guy who's doing stand-up for 19 years and who has as many credits as he has  and is as big on the show as he is who comes in comes in uh you know we we just need him for a day  and he's like i'll be there and he comes in he doesn't have anything to plug he's not fucking  pushing anything he's here just because we're like serious actually do you see a value in that 
[01:16:00]  serious xm has never given him a dime so when it comes something like this it should be a no-brainer  yeah make sure you give him way more money than they are paying him i know i know what they're  paying guy give him a suite and give him a car right get him up there without even good room  without even thinking that's it oh and he pays his own his own parking when he comes here he  doesn't even ask for the parking he should he should never which by the way for his truck because  he's got the biggest fucking truck i've ever seen yeah it's got to be fifty dollars easily  every time he comes the guy should not have to pay for parking when he's doing a what amounts to a 
[01:16:30]  favor for the show and for the company it's there's no there's no thought going behind this  shit like when i hear stuff like that i really honestly want to know who decided not to get  patrice a ride at from from new york to uh foxwoods who's the one that said no someone said no someone  said we we don't need to do that i bet who is it i bet they didn't say no is it the board upstairs i 
[01:17:00]  bet they asked the question do we really need to do that is that necessary someone said no a lot of  them don't say no they just leave it up there and it doesn't get done like yeah do you really  think we need to do that i'm not too sure i would love to know i want to know who fucking as they  were going down the whole list of everything that has to be done to pull this off who decided all  right patrice doesn't need a ride up there we we don't we won't have to do that yeah he could drive  himself who did that there's a name attached to that person who the fuck was it no one will come 
[01:17:30]  forward by the way no i will never get a name look down the hall someone will pop out of the  office any never get any second of who and what the excuse is like there'll be some fucking excuse  oh no we didn't say uh no no we we didn't say we just assumed that he was no and then when it came  up we we figured well he should have been you know you don't treat a guest like that assuming and then  waiting until it comes up that he needs a ride and then offering the right obviously didn't wasn't 
[01:18:00]  taken care of right away because uh he was ready to hand the check back every hand if he didn't  accept the check it had been spoken about and he must have been told no or we don't think we can do  that exactly we walked out with him yesterday he handed the check back yeah so but it's the company's  a bit schizo because they'll they'll throw piles of money at people i'm not even gonna i'm not even  gonna fucking single anyone out but what this company loves to do is just throw waves of money at 
[01:18:30]  yeah uh some people yep and then they penny pinched nickel and dime out of everybody else  that works here nickel and instead of doing something that is a no-brainer let's just do  the right thing here's a guy that when jimmy's doing uh his la thing comes in on a regular basis  for free pays for his parking for free never even asked anybody could you at least pay for my parking  doesn't even ask he's hilarious and hilarious fucking yesterday's show was great patrice was in rare  form there's nothing i hate more than being nickel and dimed nickel and dime by anybody hate i don't 
[01:19:00]  fucking nickel and diming i don't understand it and there's no fucking reason for it there's no reason  for it you don't treat fucking uh patrice like that when he's he's he's doing this for us oh speaking  a person like patrice walk in come on there he is colin it's a big broadway star he's gotta be  treated like a big he has to be invited in like a vampire just stood outside like a creep he has to 
[01:19:30]  be invited in yeah look out oh he's got wait wait do you have the white iphone or is that a cover  yeah no it's the white one it's the three gs it's not the four oh oh sorry about that sorry  about that hey we saw your pal colin i gotta start get on mike first of all i gotta i gotta start by  telling you we went to the paul mccartney show at the uh yeah and your uh your pal jerry seinfeld  was there yes he is very talented i'm i will never argue that but he is a nerd he is one of the finest 
[01:20:00]  sitcoms in uh exactly but he is a nerd he was standing with george wallace trying to like  bob to the paul mccartney music and he was so nerdy half the time i think me and it were just  watching seinfeld heads bobbing up and down i think he was tapping his foot right he just  he looked out of place on a paul mccartney show he has some real toe tappers yes he certainly does  i like some of the mccartney's earlier stuff after 1965 i really yeah that's uh all 
[01:20:30]  shit after that a lot of good stuff after 65 oh jesus look who it is that was jim  it was it was a friend of jim yes you should have been there something why weren't you at  the paul mccartney show i wasn't invited to paul mccartney's you should have been you should  have been they invited pretty much everyone yeah they did they really did seinfeld paul simon and  colin i understand why he wasn't invited really if we didn't work for the company you think we  would have been on the list i was actually we barely made the shock that you creeps were there 
[01:21:00]  which is we would happen to work yeah they knew that believe me they did they wanted those three  tickets to go elsewhere of course but if they didn't they would they would have been a year  of fucking paying back complaining to do it and moaning from this i'm just shocked that anthony was  at one two five one two five one two five yeah nice look at that i was in the one two five lingo  i uh i you know i made sure i was he was strapped one two five okay i was probably the only person in  one two five that was actually legally carrying yo i'm dressed kid i'm dressed he was dressed for 
[01:21:30]  the event uh see so uh uh we were just pitching about the fact that um patrice uh is going to the  uh foxwoods big poker extravaganza i have going uh this weekend what do you mean he's going to it  well he's uh one of the uh one of uh my personal guests is he playing it yes he is why wasn't i  invited first of all i'm a poker master i know i saw you on the fucking can i answer that yeah we  we wanted to yeah and then we said colin has a broadway show he's probably not going to want to 
[01:22:00]  do foxwoods you want to do it's a friday night it's a friday night you guys really think outside  the box but anyway is it don't you have shows tomorrow you do i do have shows so you could you  just wanted to be invited you couldn't come anyway yeah you're the same way so don't act like you  want to still be invited you want to come you want to come we'd love to have you you're cordially  invited it's the same way but you're not being in two places at once though oh jim come on he  can't do that colin's sick have you have your stand-in dude do you have to study do you have 
[01:22:30]  another study about this trendy awful name the anti-social network yet well yes we have with  myself and hold on myself and brewer let me plug bill bar which is the fact that it's like  there's nothing to really do with them but it's like hey that movie's hot why'd you call it the  non for the fight oh never mind be more funny be more funny hey you better watch you don't do  that on your broadway show yeah i felt like one of those terrors that lights the explosive 
[01:23:00]  you didn't ask answer the question do you have an understudy i have a nerd understudy yeah a nerd  jerry jerry will get out there and would jerry do it you think no no no no there's no one to study  that can't maybe i'll be like what's his face and does it who does all those things oh rob becker  oh the caveman guy yeah yeah and then he sends people out to make millions of dollars on his own  he just sits there at home what a life that would be what a life 
[01:23:30]  colin's biting his finger oh well you just sell the act and someone goes out  you sell the act jimmy sell it it's the act you get rid of it not selling out you're buying it  that's not crazy though i think you could buy i think you could do that move the show to some other  cities with some other guys well i gotta do it on the other cities first you know like yeah of course  with it of course you don't make money on broadway this is the big secret dirty little  secret nobody tells you is that really uh yeah i think we heard that unless you sell out every  night which maybe al pacino makes money i mean yeah well your deal is dependent on selling out 
[01:24:00]  they said even jackie mason didn't make money on broadway what no he probably did  you ever when i was there it was a lot of tickets and everybody everybody who i know who's gone  has been crowded i've never heard when i was there was a lot of tickets first of all you're stupid  i'm tired second of all it was opening night so they packed the place nobody paid you know what  opening night they have freebies i went i went recently and it was pretty full saturday night  no i was in the middle of i think it was like a tuesday night well i celebrate the city is emptier

[01:29:00]  fucking woman beating let's go see that fucking clip not yet what gentle wonderful people that  is there's um it's like it's like we would capture something on our cell phone if you saw a funny  moment happening in the street right or perhaps somebody dressed a little silly or or a big fat  ass in some some jeans you'd you'd click and and twitter it these guys make it sound so so  benevolent when you know the fucking hateful shit i've seen you guys put around oh a silly guy in a 
[01:29:30]  crazy outfit it's just silly in his life for six months but go ahead smashing a homeless guy's  only food source yeah exactly that might have happened once but uh we've moved on from there's  this sudanese uh woman and she's uh in her traditional garb and god knows what she did i'm  sure she mouthed off or well for wearing pants it was for wearing pants it was for wearing pants  was it for wearing yeah i mean it wasn't like there was no reason for it and uh turn the volume up you  want to hear her wails and screams yeah it's a lovely culture islam lovely uh whipping her in public 
[01:30:00]  this is like what you do in the park you don't but this is like shakespeare in the park for them  yeah you could just beat all cultures are the same and you can't judge a culture telling her to sit  down quickly which she's kind of kneeling in the middle of this courtyard kind of park thing  surrounded by people and there she goes he's getting whipped  in public for wearing pants i don't think she likes it how many lashes she's saying enough  enough 57 i think or what 52 or something  she wore pants i mean come on i like she tries to get away at one point and blocks the guy she 
[01:30:30]  grabs one guy's whip and the other guy comes in and smashes her in the back just savages  this is the peaceful people of the muslim religion where uh you're listening to at home and and we're  watching is it is it muslim though or is it just patrice's people oh no i do believe it's muslim uh  law that they are adhering to i know i'm trying to get on that kind of a race i know i'm being 
[01:31:00]  literal sorry when he goes actually i believe it's actually she grabs the whip and then the guy comes  from behind like ah she's screaming for a mother and here comes another guy hey let go of that guy's  what the well that's the way you should treat your women when they uh don't dress properly there  you go they're a lovely lovely group anytime a woman gets upset that she you know thinks she was  passed over for a raise in the workplace because she thinks her boss might be misogynistic uh yeah 
[01:31:30]  maybe you should watch this you think this is gonna be a human resources situation i think these  people are gonna be held accountable by hr this is gonna be an hr incident good toyota ad though you  see the tailgate of that toyota pickup they love their toyotas over there my god everywhere look at  that toyota she's counting that was 54 lashes just the uh subtitled by tariq he's got a career  yeah tariq was good yeah tariq that's uh perfect and then ah ah ah ah ah ah and they'll all say 
[01:32:00]  well all religions shut up yeah that's how that's the way they get out of it by saying well you know  something it's not you can't condemn the entire religion fucking barbaric that's accepted though  that isn't no one's no one speaks out that that is evil did any did anybody doubt who the  fucking swedish bomber i mean come on even in sweden please it's fucking everywhere they just  everywhere it's i'm sorry my personal opinion here my personal opinion these are not the views 
[01:32:30]  of sirius xm solid radio but my personal opinion is it is a violent horrid religion uh uh and i think  there's maybe a few good people in a shitload of bad apples as aside from uh what they say the the  other way around well i danny agree with you and if jim norton were here i know he would too  isn't that a colin quinn line with the apple thing jimmy says it every once in a while  probably my line it was one of the funniest lines from tough crowd and i forget what you were talking  about about islam but you said why let a few million bad apples spoil the bunch it was i don't know if 
[01:33:00]  you were uh or over wrote it but it was one of the funniest lines anyone's ever said yeah excuse me  what because ken over wrote some very funny uh stuff and for some reason i thought that was his and  that's what you talked to uh rosie about the ken over thing you guys were really good friends i was  like wow colin opening up yeah what what the hell of course i love ken over yeah i know you did  that was very sad that's my impression of colin back in the old days but but opie sounds almost 
[01:33:30]  bewildered like that what do you want me to do go on there and crack jokes about no you just  hey rosie quit being so serious the guy's dead now let's move along i guess you i guess you adjust  depending on what you're doing we're just goofballs if you want to have a serious discussion i'll be  glad to no sorry i'm just saying that with crumbs on you i'm just saying it was nice to hear a  different side of you that's all yeah you got still got crumbs no serious discussion well you have  crumbs like a child like a little you're like a you're like a child you're like a baby man 
[01:34:00]  uh as uh as anybody uh because you know you do get assholes in the crowd every so often  has anyone yelled anything out some real a-holes don't look at me right the fans are always right  because it's not you know you're not up there carolines or anything like that it's a broadway  show anyone scream anything out isn't it funny how carolines used to be like the pinnacle of comedy  and i was like you know up there at carolines well you know times have changed oh that's  broadway too wait a minute i'm just talking about relativity you know it's sort of a theme today 
[01:34:30]  he holds his coffee cup very artistically his legs are crossed i feel that it's very broadway i  feel dressed all in black well let me tell you a little bit about the person you see up there on  stage i i go up there it's part me but i went to high school with this guy oh god and yeah what do you  mean this crowd has there been any have you got you got any fucking idiot that thinks they're at  just any comedy show and blurt something summer there was uh these guys like between each of the  break parts and then i go guys it's not a jets game which was of course the small thing to say

[01:41:00]  yeah yeah they've been there a while too that's kind of a real up to two years possibly that's a  great area to dump a body how do you not smell that shit going to a jones beach show you know what  you know what the areas like to dump a body you remember when clemenza uh uh had uh paulie  popped that was ocean beach right that that that those high weeds and reeds and  shit that they're parked in that's right imagine dragging a body in there and dumping it no one's  going in there why so lazy 10 feet off the highway you couldn't go another 20 well even joel rifkin 
[01:41:30]  said he's very lazy with uh right getting rid of sloppy they went to rifkin the the new york post  really really great uh uh uh the new york post giving this guy attention which is why he killed  people in the first place why he's put in prison and you think he's just gonna rot away there he  must have loved getting that call like hey uh the the post is here to talk to you about a murder  it's a manhunter thinks he's hannibal lecter yeah they're coming to talk to him about uh 
[01:42:00]  about uh another serial killer and he looks good he looks healthy in jail that's another thing like  hey i'm i'm on my way to lunch but i'll talk to you guys he's not suffering in jail after what he did  if the press comes to you in prison after 17 years your first word should be help me it's hell in  here right every day i get ass raped it's horrible they beat me on a daily basis and he's smack talking  other serial killers he's just that's all he's just hanging out he's joking because he's just in  prison that's become his life life in prison isn't that bad it if you're the likes of a joel rifkin 
[01:42:30]  you kill some people you go to prison it becomes your life you just go oh the the post is here  all right i'm gonna go grab something to eat and then i'll talk to them well rested looks like he's  getting some haircuts the death penalty and some nice shaves in in prison it just becomes your life  17 years 17 years you think in prison he looks great from the outside looking in you think a prison  and you would be like oh my god i'd never want to go there it's horrible once you're in a situation 
[01:43:00]  it all of a sudden becomes your life and what you have to deal with no matter what it is are we  still talking about prison yes this sounds like the monologue you go through inner monologue every  morning when i'm going to sleep or when i'm just getting home it's every moment of my life the  situation you know this is it this is it folks of course they should have killed him i wouldn't mind  if they did like the old days like brain operation experiments on him but they don't even do that  we can study him but they don't even study these creeps they wait till after they die and then 
[01:43:30]  look at their brain and try to figure out why they did certain things but yeah experimentation  would be a lot better he was uh he was smack talking this latest serial killer saying that he  did you know and he was very proud of his work joel rifkin actually said uh i did a much better job of  hiding my bodies and he goes i distributed them in other locations because this guy's just dumping  him in one place then why the 17 years in prison if he did a better job well because he had one in  the back of his pickup truck and got pulled over by the cops was that a random terrible  fucking weakness why would you break the laws driving you got a dead body in your car it was 
[01:44:00]  some like just making a u-turn he did something they'd all get busted like that yeah yeah doing  something stupid parking tickets right berkowitz they went back and traced the parking ticket  bundy was pulled over in his volkswagen rifkin in his truck randy kraft a brutal killer a  gay killer in california who tortured guys right no oh i thought that was the different guy thanks  for fucking up my story he got pulled over with uh guy who gets sidetracked easy forget it he got 
[01:44:30]  pulled over and he had a dead marine or a dead dead guy in his car but i like the fact that jim  somehow first of all he's talking to the one serial killer expert me bundy didn't get pulled  over for a fucking traffic violation you misinformer he got i'm saying he got pulled over  the you man yeah of course he got pulled over because they suspected of being a serial killer  trying to destroy your own devious purposes it wasn't like uh i noticed your wipers weren't on 
[01:45:00]  during a rainstorm no they pulled bundy over because he had escaped and he had he not killed  again he was in florida when he got pulled over yeah and uh he had a fucking the seat was missing  dude he got stopped they weren't chasing him that was that is the scariest part you know what let's  just go back to the rifkin thing here's the story and back in 1993 state troopers spot out  spotting his pickup truck without license plates on the southern state parkway high-speed chase ended  in mineola where he crashed that mineola there uh it's one of my favorite quotes archie bunker is 
[01:45:30]  talking about uh the lodge was it was going out to long island and he goes ah we're all getting  together there in mineola they got all the cold cuts you could shove in you it's just a great mineola  joke sorry how you should be sorry of all the great lines on all in the family he picks the  one line that you sat there how about i just like mineola a guy would like the little kid and he was  like hey i know that place i know mineola that's where dad gets drunk that's a nice long island  reference what was the line a guy would a guy would something is a four eyes a guy was something is a 
[01:46:00]  quick it was one of the greatest lines ever oh well better better than mine you look up randy  crap i mean uh how bundy got busted by a fucking serial killer we're still reading this yeah  rifkin got uh pulled over he uh yeah the high speed spotted his truck without plates high-speed  chase mineoli crashed into a utility pole was located directly in front of the courthouse  in which he would eventually stand trial troopers detected an odor from the back of the truck  it came from the corpse of tiffany brisciani oh my god so he's driving around with no 
[01:46:30]  corpse and no plates no plates and he's yeah and he's saying this guy's sloppy yeah i think  it's still out there it's my tag i forgot to put on my tags but you almost said what's wrong with  this guy but you caught yourself yeah because he had a hooker dead in his truck so he's but i mean  how stupid can you be unbelievably you shouldn't be saying that someone else is stupid and sloppy  still got that dead body smell can avian the writer come up to the show guys of course who's that 
[01:47:00]  yes adrian can come up sure yes nice adrian leblanc yeah she's great of course okay to put in the  system yeah eric has the quote you were looking for okay we can play this just because a guy is  sensitive and he's an intellectual and he wears glasses you make him out of queer i never said a  guy who wears glasses is a queer a guy who wears glasses is a four eyes a guy who's a fag is a queer  you can never say that a guy who wears glasses is a four eyes you can't say that is a queer 
[01:47:30]  seinfeld wasn't allowed to do that on his show there uh that's right that's right it's a fag  it's a queer come on now i want to see how um now i have to see how bundy was why don't i just look  it up i have a computer just bugs him that i probably have great info you don't oh terrific  you certainly do no he doesn't he's he's terrific he's probably mixing it up with someone  oh colin wanted to talk about long island yeah a little about long island where anthony and i are 
[01:48:00]  from and uh where anthony still lives home invaders yes i uh i'm like um i'm like uh the salmon you  know i left but then i gotta swim back yes and just come back to long island first of all i'm trying  i'm gonna show i'm my plan is shoot all my movies on long island oh like the old uh howl holbrook that's  very good yes i get all kinds of i get all kinds of scripts and the greatest long island movie of  course of all time is good fellas oh well even though they shot that in staten island let's face  it was it staten island yeah yeah but that's you know just that whole island park like and valley 
[01:48:30]  stream like early yeah yeah that whole thing early 80s near kennedy airport kind of a thing  idlewild it was long island yeah idlewild airport colin loves long island i don't know why it's uh  my favorite thing when he represents everything about america is in long island well you brought  up the dream and the fall yeah you brought up during uh the break the fact that uh i i was  talking about this guy like yeah home invasions and serial killer and and colin's like lambasting 
[01:49:00]  me like you're talking about long island like it's 1970 yeah the the idealistic suburbia of new  york city but it's been crime ridden for years yeah it has it's really you know it's got the it's  got so many derelicts in long island yeah it's really insane yeah even everybody from long island  knows it everybody says oh you really have to pick your areas now when you move to long island  and years ago it used to be you just went to long island you moved there it was going to be nice  there were a couple of areas you had to watch for i think wine dance has always been a little iffy 
[01:49:30]  the dance has always been bad the dance colin is dubbing wine dance the dance and i think that should  take off and the veld the veld roosevelt the veld for roosevelt which is very uh a lot of crime going  on there yes it's always been brutal uh yeah yeah very bad uh but it's one of those uh things it's  sort of you we remember it as being kind of the nice suburban hey we're going i remember as a kid  going on a field trip into new york city and it was like oh we're going to the city this is danger 
[01:50:00]  go to the museum of natural history look out up the west side yeah and uh but it was always this  element of like oh it's the city i always heard about you know the dangers and the i remember i  remember a class trip to the museum of natural history with my class yeah and i just remember  half the kids immediately like yo the minute we got on the train i was like this nice kid like oh  we're going to the museum i really hate it but i'll suffer through it and half the kids like  bust out immediately on the train then all the porter we can get to like making out on the uh  dinosaurs they're like 12 years old they're like making out of the dinosaurs i was like wow 
[01:50:30]  everybody's really you're trying to be a good kid through this whole thing suffering through it i was  like what the hell god damn i see that's something i never said where where were you where'd you go  to school that that that happened that was at is88 oh see okay that's a little it's a little  different than cuba hill elementary school cuba hill yeah it's a road called cuba hill it had nothing  to do with cuba but it was cuba hill elementary it's not much of a hill either by the way no 
[01:51:00]  it's a little fucking mound yeah the school is on but that's what i want christ he knows it too yes  all white this is long island all white except for one kid named smitty dunbar and smitty dunbar  used to always ask me for a stick of gum every time uh i saw him because i used to get my gum was  like fucking cigarettes in prison or money right outside world if you had a stick of gum and he would  like kind of shake me down for a stick of gum and you know you'd only be like you know yo and you  got a stick yeah i could get a stick i'd be like uh he would just say stick you got a stick i'd be 
[01:51:30]  like yes uh here you go i'd give it to him because i didn't want to be the guy that got pummeled by  the only black guy smitty dunbar dunbar you can't get beat up by a guy named dunbar nah smitty dunbar was  the only black guy yeah was he scary uh no but he was the only black guy in my school so he by default he  was the scary guy well that's the other illusion that people live under it's like oh the black  kids are like prejudiced against when there's like one or two black kids in the school they're like  the kid uh homecoming king you know it's like oh he experienced racism it's like no they revere 
[01:52:00]  these kids come on come on we quit living in 1940 for a minute live in reality we had we had lame  black guys in my high school you did lame fake black guys well that was uh i tell the story all  time played a lot of basketball and then we went to wine and play them and then i'm looking at the  black guys for some comfort like okay you know you understand this world right and they're shaking  it's just as scared as we were when we played these animals obi went to school in is the whole  harborfield neighborhood harborfields high school it was north shore long island beach community people 
[01:52:30]  right so you you need to go in houses that were very close to the north shore beaches which  you know that that a lot of people from money you're not getting a lot of um diversity and that's  our black kids were barely in the ghetto like just over the border but not deep enough in the  ghetto to really understand the black culture you had to go down to help us out when we were playing  these other black schools you had to go past the tracks you know where he's like hey guys take care  of this could you just take care of we were we would we would pull into amityville and wine dance to

[01:58:30]  on february 15th shortly after 1 a.m bundy was stopped by pentacola police officer when the officer  called in to check the license plate the vehicle came up as stolen all right bill curtis bundy then  scuffled with the officer before he was finally subdued so there he was just a random stop it was  a traffic violation let's talk about something more pleasant you know i'm trying to get a movie made  called hearts and diamonds and also results and also my own movies immigration movies and you 
[01:59:00]  know if you guys want to kick in a few million i'd really like to start shooting out long island  anytime you like time to back colin yeah it really is a good time to put money to colin  yeah back that horse yeah we're out on long island where are you looking at where you score  you're you're fucking scoping out locations where can we shoot konkama i don't know get the lake in  there good for a couple of them yeah put the lake in there and everything maybe some south  shore bay shore white trash places well yeah plus one side bars you know otb is almost out of  business except in long island so that's where oh it's still running on long island it's still 
[01:59:30]  running in the city but it's almost under but i mean but what about long island long island's  always going to be there's always going to be one in uh hicksville i used to go to the one in comac  all the time in comac right next it was right next to the place i worked and right next to the  bar i went to so we would go for lunch and we'd leave the place we worked true mechanical  air conditioning and heating of course my forte and then uh we'd go to the bar get some drinks  for lunch and then work with heavy machinery but as we're drinking we'd go over and make a few bets  we make a few bets go back to the bar and and see if we won and then go back uh it's to the 
[02:00:00]  fucking heavy cutting metal machines and welding things and giant rollers drunk off our asses  drunk and angry because just lost and man because we lost yeah fucking oh ah there's there's always this  guy i played the triple the a the c and the f i and i wielded and then the a and the f came in  but then the d came in the c with and then i had the d with the it's like you're you're fucking lost  right you're fucking lost they always have a story of how close they came exactly that's what it's 
[02:00:30]  about so i had the four with the six you just see old guys with the program rolled up in their hand  smacking their other hand all mad at themselves i love it there's no you get such a great  fucking vibe in a long island otb you know my friend mike reynolds is another big uh he's a he's  a comedian because like a big gambler growing up degenerate oh yeah one time he's at the track  and he said the race you know everybody screams right during the race and then it just gets real 
[02:01:00]  quiet of every yeah yeah and here's one guy goes in the middle of this guy didn't even say who said  it just he just heard a voice go fuck you god you jew fuck  god should have been looking out for him that day obviously he had a laugh  oh nothing everybody just agreed yeah are you amazed otb's going under we've talked about it on our  show that's that's impossible no bookie loses money leave it to the fucking you know leave it 
[02:01:30]  to the state state of the city to fuck that up to fuck up a book uh making and you expect them to  run like the transit authority and all that other shit that's legitimate right like if they can't  run a bookie joint which always makes money yeah how are you going to run fucking transportation  and fucking infrastructure and all that shit it's that's why the taxes go up service goes down  because they can't even run a fucking horse race operation exactly the mob did it they stole the 
[02:02:00]  idea from the mob and they can't even pull it off they can't do it because the mob knew you don't put  ten guys in charge of something one guy could do right you start whacking some people out you got  to whack them out cut down on the overhead but no they'll put ten redundant jobs and that's with  everything in new york you think the transit authority needs every person they have working for them  and management and whatnot making all those giant fucking paychecks no but they keep them on because  of the unions or whatever but but it's like it's ten levels deep of redundancy that we're paying for 
[02:02:30]  and then they can't figure out where the money's going and why i as a long islander who does not  take the fucking uh railroad and even if i do i pay for it i drive in i pay taxes on every aspect of  my vehicle now i have to pay a transit tax uh on top of that because a train goes near my area  it's astounding and infuriating to me that this shit happens i'm so glad and if the  fucking democrats pull that shit with this fucking tax bill they would load it up just 
[02:03:00]  load it up with earmarks and pork and bullshit that has nothing to do with the fucking and then  they want the estate tax because they're they're kind of mad now that the bush era tax  breaks yeah i'm freaking out bush era tax breaks looks like it's gonna pass what happened it looks  like we're gonna we're gonna be good for another couple of years without having to pay giant amounts  of taxes where's the period where's the period all right there is no period all right there is no  period holy he's on a roll but now they're pissed off and want the estate tax raised they're not happy 
[02:03:30]  with you dying they want to take half your fucking money when you're dead and by the way all that  shit that you have when you're dead you already bought it with taxed money and they want half your  shit and they say that it's too generous now that they have to increase it who votes for these  fucking people thank you i'm done you tell them anthony tell them now i just get it just gets me  very angry with that we're going to take a break i get infuriated like you said it just goes into

[02:13:30]  strip club in wisconsin oh yeah and this gentleman uh put up a sign in front of his business that says  no negroes allowed no negroes allowed he said it's his business he's had enough problems with black  people over the years that he um feels it's his right to put this sign up even though it violates  civil law laws that have been in place since 1964 but um he's putting a no negroes allowed sign up and 
[02:14:00]  uh his business isn't open yet once it does open he will be held responsible for this legally um uh he  had to put it inside his establishment people were a little angry but by the looks of the sign danny  brought this up earlier it looks like something happened with a black guy five minutes before he  put the sign up like it's written in sharpie it's just ripped out of a piece of paper he probably  probably got cut off in traffic and went bah fucker i guess in hindsight i guess kinkos probably wouldn't 
[02:14:30]  print up a no negroes allowed sign for you can i get some no negroes allowed signs uh i need it for  by business um in an hour they sold them out some some asshole in long island had to ship them to his  mansion wiped out the warehouse he put them on every door in his house the whole pallet you guys  are in your backyard how's there been a black person step foot in your house here uh patrice o'neal  really has been in my house uh why was he there a party oh it was a part i think you were there

[02:48:30]  what do you what do you like what what are you more of a submissive dominant um i'm a switch i like  to be both but i'm very but really inside you can only be one really really real you yeah i think at  home with my guy i like to be submissive because i'm dominant everywhere else and yeah guys are probably  like a little intimidated i would gather and not want to like be a little too rugged with you  i'm just in control of everything so at home when i'm in bed i want to be vulnerable just like  fuck me you know wow yeah that's great that's how we are here that's what we said here we're 
[02:49:00]  signing our contracts  anytime we hear fuck me even if it's from a beautiful girl we just think yeah the contract  but a lot of women are like that like a lot of women who are like lawyers and  fucking like women female cops they're like real subs at home because they're like you know  yeah they have the whole life yeah professional life yeah yeah i like to spank very much yeah you  like to be spanked or just to spank occasionally i like to spank but not for sexy things for like 
[02:49:30]  other things like for real things like stealing candy yeah like you you're supposed to take your  grandmother for chemo you didn't the unsexiest scenarios that would be horrid yes do you like  a little spanking every so often things like that that's not really one of your things i'll spank you  anytime you want oh yeah anytime you want are you are you are you wow i like thank you right now let me  do it if i didn't have a girlfriend i would but i would get in a lot of trouble i would certainly do it 
[02:50:00]  but for spanking if i'm let's just say there's been problems in my life due to my sexual proclivities  so with this girl i'm a good boy okay yeah i'm just saying you're willing to take a strap in your  ass but i can't even spank you no it's not a morals issue this is not this is not a uh not a moral  conundrum no not at all believe me i would let you spank me i'd let you spit on me but i have a girl i  can't do it why don't you stab him in the face with that pen and slap him yeah i'd like to see  that it would be i think it would be the same thing as telling jimmy like just a sip of beer 
[02:50:30]  because then my girlfriend would go like what do you want like do you want somebody spanking me  and i'd have to like pull my dick out and go yeah just can i watch and she would lose that argument  so it's how much pleasure can you get out of spanking his nice soft smooth powdery  ass right now i do have a very spankable rump very hairless he does yeah he's very hairless yeah i'm  almost molestable it's like spanking a hamster  very fine yeah it's a good it's a good bottom of the spank what uh what else are you into as far

[02:51:30]  a dominant thing that'd be kind of hot to be humiliated like that like really yeah oh he's  starting to weaken no but it's like the greatest thing it's the greatest you have to take the things  that they hurt you and you sexualize and that's what we do and men are jealous oh  so the idea of you're a woman fucking somebody else is awful but you can always sexualize it  and that can become an incredible and especially if she's on working so she's doing uh uh she's 
[02:52:00]  fucking guys films yes so then you watching that would be like like oh god i could never compete with  that no and that's that because guys that really know how to fuck that's a hot type of it's a cuckolding  you know that's that's hot but you don't want to be completely degraded like i wouldn't want to  fuck her and have her go like why don't you do a sit-up you pig and i'd be like just sad  that's not sexy at all yeah there's a certain thing but if someone tells you like your cock is  not uh it's good really i never could imagine that you are such a little weirdo it breaks it

[03:04:30]  i had like i had urethritis or something what is urethritis it's like some disease you get when  you're like a 90 year old guy but i had it when i was like 28 so your urethro was a little inflamed  yeah i went to the doctor yeah i think that was it yeah but i ended up getting the doctor give me  the news yeah and they showed me a whole book full of dicks i was bellyaching about how like oh i  can't believe i got a problem only 28. oh and he pulled it you should be lucky don't feel sorry for 
[03:05:00]  yourself and he said the number one cause of it was people having doggy style sex and pulling out  and accidentally you gotta watch that abutment but showing your whole book that's weird too he was  hoping you were gonna get excited it made me feel great yeah no that was that was the foreplay  graphic thing i've ever seen did he caress your cock while you were looking like you're so lucky to  have this beautiful specimen rub this salve into your cock yeah let's start the treatment as you  was it hurting when you peed is that what the problem was no it's just my balls felt like as if 
[03:05:30]  somebody was pulling on them even when i was just walking around like jesus christ pulling on my  it was a poltergeist that's what it felt like all the time you felt like internally somebody's  pulling your balls that'd be great i would never heard of that no that doesn't sound pleasant if  you're just you know at work no jim i know it sounds great on the outside seriously  it's time for the serious moment in the show oh people are going hey old man it's called gravity oh  look at this oh yeah now but i'm saying i was 28 when you were a kid i think i've had urethritis i had 
[03:06:00]  that a few years ago i think no really prostatitis that's what i had prostatitis yeah it's like an  old man it does sound older and that made you feel like your balls used to smoke like three four  packs a day and drinks soda all day which is soda yeah i think uh my balls are falling down and you  could get win these la gear sneakers yeah it was on mtv at the time ow my ball oh colin 
[03:06:30]  ah the young crazy colin with his balls falling down speaking of balls i worked with a guy one  time that only had one ball hitler yeah richard balser tom green he was in a he was in a but no  not tom green he was in a bicycle accident so one of his testicles got cut out what an accident it  was a it was a threesome it was me and this girl and this guy and i kept saying really two and a  handsome but i kept saying yeah lick his ball oh and the director's like nikki you can't say ball 
[03:07:00]  you gotta say balls because like the audience is gonna get turned off i kept forgetting because i  wanted to be correct yeah yeah so i kept telling her to lick his ball how awful would that be the  sack with one ball one ball in it and the other one just kind of droopy dog earring like a bass and  hound ear well you can get ball implants you know yeah yeah get a ball bearing or something like a  ball bearing it's a ping pong ball a metal fucking big ball bearing in there why not you'd be like a  super villain somebody you're gonna smack smack that's all you got you get two glass ones so 
[03:07:30]  you can shatter them easily give a girl a roman war helmet she goes blind see because they're heavy  all right maybe she wouldn't do you shave everything completely i prefer that uh you  know what i used to and then i wanted to switch it up i was getting bored so now i have a little  like landing stretch yeah you know what i'm gonna say this for the record and i want your opinion i 
[03:08:00]  think hair making a comeback oh definitely hair making a comeback everybody and i couldn't be happier  i kind of like a little bit of uh fuzz down there yeah i'm not talking the old 70s earth i'm not  talking fucking thighs covered with hair or right down to the asshole none of that but a little bit  to know what you're dealing with is kind of like it fucking gone i never want to hear this again for  myself i'm not talking about that you're not talking about that right right right oh my god you're like 
[03:08:30]  hair in the ass too is that making a comeback i shaved my ass around the subject but but i think  occasionally it's cool to look at pictures of like al natural it's not cool it's just fun it's fun look  at that what's wrong with that 1982 that's hysterical look at that boy these girls when did they start  learning i want it to look fat and like ceramic wow look at that yeah that's a lot damn turn back the  page before they were seeing some caligula that were very fucking hot yeah the sex in caligula was 
[03:09:00]  a great that lesbian scene it was phenomenal that's it look at bob in memorial bob he did some great  work fucking guccione got gilgood into a fucking porno amazing right was he in that caligula gilgood  peter o'toole malcolm mcdowell helen mirren i'm going through all the years of bob guccione here  he celebrated when he gets to me that's when we start chaining and then they turn and there's  baba booey it's a sexy shot of him too with the remote i know what is he doing he's doing the burt 
[03:09:30]  reynolds he's he's in the centerfold of penthouse it's like they call me baba booey from his book  and it's right after like all the hairy pussy shots i'm thumbing through and then ah then his mustache  his mustache so you you haven't do you ever like have sex with guys in your personal life and tell  them about guys that you had sex with at work no why jimmy fantasy coming through jimmy fantasy  jimmy likes that one jimmy does the interview it's like npr he's like so seriously 
[03:10:00]  no i don't think they want to hear about that you know well i mean i know you do but  yeah i'm a great guy yeah call him tell me about your day at work listen if i come home from work  and i'm fucking a civilian and he's asking me about the guy's dick i just worked with there's  something wrong oh see you don't like i mean right right no i'm like why are you asking about the  guy's dead exactly ask about my vagina but he doesn't have to ask about the dick because he wants the 
[03:10:30]  dick he could ask about it because it's sexy that you fucked a guy with a bigger dick right before you  went over and it's a way of humiliating himself it's not like he wants to fuck the guy no he  doesn't want the guy to fuck him get them both to bring them both a beat and they both can  fuck each other maybe he's just wondering because his dick felt like a clapper inside a bell  like who are you fucking yeah 
[03:11:00]  is there such a thing as a canadian porn industry ah canadian porn industry  fucking brandon iron is from canada he can't get back into the states you know brandon no no  there's a lot of canadians in the adult industry actually yeah they don't have their own it's like  hockey uh only with sex no it's like with hollywood everybody goes to la right yeah who are some  canadian porn girls uh myself sunny leone shyla styles um dudley do right's got a big cock  yeah and he fucks chicks with his chin it's a visual yeah certainly wasn't an audio 
[03:11:30]  my favorite part of that and people at home can't see this because anthony was doing  i was doing i was doing a chin fucking he was really trying to sell it i was trying i'll do  anything there were no take dancing fucking monkey here he was selling it there were no takers no  other words peter north is canadian he's got some big loads oh he's notorious for his  like that huh well i respect it yeah i respect i respect peter north's ability i respect it to 
[03:12:00]  cover somebody yes i wish i could do that yeah a lot of uh oh just just when you think it's over  there's four more shots coming now could he do that take i have to take a movie after the fact that  he could do that once is amazing he's been doing it his whole career his body produces a lot of sperm  let's face it it's kind of an interesting phenomenon he's a freak of nature it's more  the semen than sperm oh i don't know what's the difference well the sperm is the actual sperm 
[03:12:30]  from the testicles the semen comes from the prostate it's the juice the sperm swim in really  yeah so it was one of the same thing all this time no they mix right before they come out of your  cock what makes it taste so bad um i don't know how many you call it bad jimmy  taste of my own yeah spermatozoa no it's very much tell you what uh drink a lot of pineapple juice  no i don't care i like the punishment element there's a lot of punishment going on that's how  he bleaches his teeth 
[03:13:00]  i save a lot of money on chris white strips  then tell you what eat a lot of asparagus that's going to make your i do  so funky the come too because my piss smells really strong i love asparagus piss yeah but  come disgusting really yeah oh nice good for me so eat something i jerk off and taste it no i only  did that once it was kind of like i like that it was like a martha stewart tip  it leaves a really weird it's like very very uh metallic and it clings to your throat 
[03:13:30]  metallic yeah it tastes like metal she's talking like she's never tasted  yeah you get the only thing i'm thinking about metallic is like if you go down on a girl in her  period i won't do that i won't even allow a woman to prepare my meals when she's on her  period come on i'm like you must sleep in the other room on the floor mat he sends him he sends  him into the desert for three days get in there three days i thought it was five oh why not you'll  eat on the period i don't care do you like period sex earned his red wings i don't care at all 
[03:14:00]  guys usually don't care they put a towel under me put a towel under me i don't care i don't like  yeah get a towel don't ruin my sheets i don't get involved with that why i just don't care  why do you care what's the difference i don't like blood what's the difference too much blood  what all the other uh what all the other shit that's coming out of everywhere what's the  difference spit blood and vaginal mucus and fucking it's all just part of the human body  you got yeah what's a little blood you're okay with using an enema but you're not okay with a period 
[03:14:30]  but not an anima sexually that would be that would be a necessary evil using an ammo for  before i get fucked with a strap on it's like getting a hotel room it's a part of the process  leading up to it i've come i've come away from sex looking like our butt's wire  dude i can't do it in the period man i'm not squeamish about many things either i don't i don't  need you to shower you can be dirty i don't spit on me you can piss i'm fucking dirty but that's your  line i have a very weird line what about you you don't care i don't care the guy doesn't care it's up to the 
[03:15:00]  guy really yeah why did you say you remember nick to paulo's joke what when he said yeah my  girlfriend we're having sex and she had a period she said it's not that heavy he goes next to you  know when the horse's head scene for the godfather  do you uh what do you uh condoms what do you what do you do um birth control  hell yeah yeah condoms i don't work no work babies um condoms no we don't use condoms uh 
[03:15:30]  in movies you don't have to just stop right there we don't use condoms i like that at home yeah  really yeah why what do you mean why you don't want to feel uh good yeah you don't want to feel  good that doesn't bother a guy though that he sees you having sex unprotected at work and then even if  he's hiv negative but then it's protected at home see here's the thing if it's someone i'm dating  yeah of course no condom but if i'm just you know banging on condom well how about if he has test 
[03:16:00]  results that are negative they better be from the night before oh what about uh blowjobs though what  about them oh yeah no no i don't like the taste of condoms how about if i could show you a test result  from the summer of 95 and it's almost perfect  there's a few discrepancies it's like an fbi informant report it's blacked out  it may look like there's a little a little white out over there but on certain parts 
[03:16:30]  yeah so information act on jim's health bill are you scared okay well because you said health  bill old lady are you scared of hiv and stuff i'm scared of it uh no i'm not it's it's definitely  a concern but the thing is is like as a performer we all in the industry want to keep our industry  safe so we don't around we don't really i don't go and just fuck people carelessly without a condom  i want to protect myself and my co-workers that hiv what a kill joy that was they think they cured
