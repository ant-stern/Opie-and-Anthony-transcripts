<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a discussion of their "Moms I'd Like to F" contest, featuring entries from various women, including Tracy (who later withdrew her photo due to her son's discomfort), Marianne (a "hot mom" who arrives in studio with her husband and four sons, the oldest being 14), Pam, and Bellevue Angela (from the HBO show *Bellevue*).  The prizes are a Myrtle Beach vacation, a combo DVD/VHS player, and bikini shavers. The conversation quickly devolves into sexually explicit jokes and comments about the contestants' appearances.  The hosts then transition to discussing comedian Paula Poundstone's recent charges for lewd acts with minors, using graphic descriptions and offensive language. This segues into a derogatory discussion about female comedians.  Earl, a co-worker, is teased for his clothing choice before being sent to a promotional event. The hosts then announce upcoming show segments: "cat fighting" (naked women fighting), a possible appearance by Carmen Electra and Jim Brewer.

Adam Ferrara joins the show as a guest.  The discussion returns to the "Moms I'd Like to F" contest, with more explicit conversations about the participants and the planned "lesbian couch" segment, involving sexual acts on a heavily stained studio couch.  The hosts recount embarrassing anecdotes, including tales of their families' drunken escapades. Brewer's mother even calls in to discuss her experiences.  Adam Ferrara’s past, somewhat arranged relationship with Anthony’s sister is revealed.  Ferrara's upcoming comedy shows are heavily promoted using sexually suggestive and offensive slogans. Carmen Electra's scheduled appearance is cancelled by her publicist, prompting complaints from the hosts.  Brief interviews with UFC fighter Carlos Nune and other guests occur.  The hosts also discuss the possibility of adding a bottle rocket to the show, referencing a previous incident. A listener, Denise, calls in to express her outrage regarding the hosts' generalizations about gay mothers adopting children.

The show culminates in the "Moms I'd Like to F" contest participants—Pam, Marianne, and Angela—engaging in sexual acts on the couch, involving whipped cream and various levels of undress, all while Marianne's husband observes.  This segment is filled with exclamations of "wow" from the hosts and detailed descriptions of the women's actions.  Listeners call in with various reactions, ranging from disbelief to excitement.  A comedic DMX parody in a James Taylor style is performed.  Jeannie, another contestant, is briefly interviewed, and her outfit is described.  The hosts frequently mention a website (www.com – the actual domain name is unspecified) displaying photos of the contestants.  The segment ends with promotions for Bud Light and Sam Adams beer.

The broadcast continues with a further discussion of the "Mom I'd Like to F the Most" contest, with comments on the physical attributes of the contestants.  A phone call from Elmo, Opie's brother, seeking assistance with his softball team's game interrupts the discussion.  Pictures of one contestant, including details about her tan and breastfeeding habits, are analyzed. The hosts recount a dorm room story about Adam Ferrara sneaking a “dancing bear” (a large pig) out of his dorm room.  Stephen Lynch's song about liking different things, culminating in vulgar statements about wanting to have sex with Adam Ferrara's sister, is played.  Listener calls follow, with people sharing stories about sneaking people or animals out of various places and a caller recounting his encounter with Carmen Electra, where he was introduced as "Stinky" by one of the hosts.  This leads to a discussion about "C-blocking."  Several listeners call in with their interpretation of “What Did We Learn” from the show.  The broadcast concludes with promotions for upcoming events, including a live show at the Stone Pony, and sponsors like Bud Light and Sobe beverages.  Throughout the entire broadcast, offensive language, sexual innuendo, and graphic descriptions are frequent.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  How are you, Anthony?  Very good.  Good, good, good.  Trying to get my computer back online here.  They sure don't have these things down yet.  Computer age and I'm restarting.  Pinyas.  What's the commotion outside the studio?  Is there a commotion or a melee?  Kind of a commotion. 
[00:00:30]  It's kind of a commotion type.  Guy's getting excited because there's a really hot mom here for the milk con.  Oh, see.  She went into the restroom to kind of get ready.  She's all ready?  Yeah.  Wow, cool.  She must be hot.  They start slow, these contests.  She must be hot because there are, I don't know, like 15 people outside the studio.  Most of them work upstairs in sales.  Yeah.  They're not allowed down here during our radio show, Anthony, because they don't get anything done.  They never come down here except when we have hot girls. 
[00:01:00]  Well, I do believe the Moms I'd Like to F contest is going quite well now.  Well, now we have a contest.  If you missed late in the show yesterday, we had a couple of late entries.  And their pictures up on WNEW.com.  Amanda and Tracy were the newest additions.  And it's a contest.  Yes, it is, Anthony.  Well, Mendy's pictures are up there, too.  I was trying to keep that from anybody.  Well, you know, there are guys out there that really think Mendy is sexy. 
[00:01:30]  So, for what you will, I don't know.  All right.  Tracy didn't want to show her face.  What was the ruling on that?  No, she called me this morning.  And I guess her son was a little freaked out in how maybe explicit the photos were coming out.  See how the mom contest works.  They have kids, people.  That's why they're moms.  And this girl.  Tracy?  Tracy.  She had a really nice face.  She's smoking.  She doesn't want to show it now?  No, she's getting a little flack from the kid.  So, what happened? 
[00:02:00]  Did we cut her face off or something?  It's got a little yellow dot over it.  Ah, let me see.  I didn't even know.  Go to WNEW.com if you want to play along.  That girl.  Oh, she was nice.  Well, you know, it's going to reflect in the voting.  But maybe the body alone can pull it off.  It was either that or she wanted to be out of the contest.  All right, all right.  No, we've got to do what the ladies want.  That's okay.  She's got a 14-year-old son, if you remember, from yesterday.  And her son's friends talked her into entering this contest. 
[00:02:30]  Bunch of little geniuses, aren't they?  And there she is in a little bikini.  More like bra and panties.  Showing off her goods.  And that's a mom.  Yeah, she looks great.  Yeah.  Ah, that sucks that she doesn't want to show her face anymore.  Yeah, because she was cute.  That will hurt the voting, Tracy.  But that's okay.  And we have a hot mom that has already arrived.  Yes.  Did you see her yet, Rick?  I didn't see her, but everybody's like, oh, she's really hot, man.  She's fun in the bathroom.  Very cool.  Ladies, you've got today and tomorrow and a couple days next week to get your asses down here and show us what you've got. 
[00:03:00]  Moms, I'd like to F.  The contest continues.  You just show up here in New York between 3 and 7 while we're broadcasting, okay?  Easy as that.  Anthony?  Yeah.  First prize for the Moms I'd Like to F Contest.  Five days, four nights at the Sands Beach Club in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  Airfare courtesy of Spirit Airlines.  Second prize, a Samsung DVD VHS player.  Oh, yeah.  The features are endless on this damn machine.  We just checked them out before the show, right? 
[00:03:30]  This is perfect, man.  It's a VCR and DVD player all in one.  Because I'm at home, and it sucks.  Just last night, I'm watching DVDs, and then you've got to switch over if you want to watch a video,  and I'm pulling wires out of the back.  All in one.  The genius of Samsung.  There you have it.  And then third prize, we've got some certificates for shavers.com.  We'll be giving out 10 bikini shavers as prizes for the Mom Contest.  And we'll dress up all these prizes with other stuff we've got laying around here. 
[00:04:00]  So there you have it, okay?  Nice.  All right.  I want to see this mom now.  Can't wait to see her.  She's still in the can.  What do you think, Ben?  Uh-oh.  Now, the sound's on out there.  Don't rain it.  She looks young to be a mom, that's all.  Oh, well, that's not a bad thing.  No, maybe that's...  Maybe that is her.  I don't know.  Well, bring her in here.  There are a lot of guys.  I'd like to talk to her.  Outside of the studio, so she has to be...  Bring her in.  She has to be hot.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, she'll do all right.  Come on in real fast.  Is she shy?  We just want to say hi to you, that's all.  Hi, how are you?  Good, how are you?  What's your name?  Marianne.  Hi, and where are you from?  I'm from up north.  Up north?  Yeah.  Up north, that's all you're going to say.  And how old is your kid?  I have four.  You have four kids?  Yeah.  That body pumped out four?  Is that your husband?  Yeah, that's my husband.  Right on, bro.  Wow, four kids.  Oh, you want us to get her, too? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, okay.  How old...  You're sick, yeah.  How old are your kids?  By the end of September, they'll be 14, 10, 6, and 2.  You have a 14-year-old?  Yeah.  Boy or girl?  All boys.  All boys.  Oh, my God.  The second girl we've had in here that has a 14-year-old son.  Yeah.  And you don't even look close enough to having a 14-year-old son.  Yeah.  And how old are you?  33.  Nice.  Wow.  You look fine.  Thank you.  Your wife looks fine, bro.  She's the hottest.  How does she stay in shape after four kids? 
[00:05:30]  Chasing.  She's running from me.  That's it.  Now, what do you work out?  You do any working out?  My tie ball.  Your tie ball.  Look at that.  The tie ball.  Oh, it does work.  It does work.  Huh.  Huh.  All right.  Cool.  Well, why don't you go outside the studio, get your pictures taken, and you can hang,  and we'll get you back on the radio when you're done, okay?  What did you bring to wear?  That's what you're wearing?  Oh, wait.  No.  Okay.  All right.  Wow.  That's really like some sexy panties. 
[00:06:00]  I can pick it out, buddy.  Did you?  Very nice.  Yes.  I was shopping today.  Very, very nice.  Do we get to see before the pictures?  Sure.  Here in the studio?  No.  No?  No.  Wait for the pictures?  All right.  Well, you know, masking for everybody.  I'm kidding.  Shut down, my friend.  It's okay.  It happens.  I know.  She shuts you down.  The girl's husband's right here.  I don't know.  She needs a drink.  That's what she needs a drink.  You like Jaeger?  She'll do anything.  We have...  Oh, there you go.  There's an icy cold Sam Adams, and we have shots of Jaeger Meister. 
[00:06:30]  Sam Adams, one of the fine sponsors of our radio program.  Get her a chilled shot of Jaeger Meister.  That's what she's going to do shots.  Speaking of which, there's another mom on the line, Pam.  Pam, what's going on?  Pam.  I'm actually parking.  I'm coming on in.  Nice.  For the contest?  Yes, I am.  All right.  And you already answered my question.  You got shots available?  I'll calm down a little bit.  As long as you're legal, no problem.  We got a few shots for you.  We're never opposed to plying the contestants with some booze.  And Bellevue Angela's already here. 
[00:07:00]  Did she...  Oh, did the guy bring the straight jacket?  He's on his way.  Oh, nice.  Is that the chicken studio now?  Huh?  Is she out there now?  She's hot.  She's hot.  Don't you like her?  Bellevue Angela.  She was on the HBO Bellevue special.  Missed it.  She was out of her mind on that special.  It's great.  But she's fine now.  She is fine now.  She's got new hair, too.  What'd she do?  She lightened it.  She lightened it up.  Cool.  We'll talk to her in a few minutes.  Why don't we get her situated there?  All right.  We have to go.  We have a long trip. 
[00:07:30]  We have a Little League game tonight.  Oh, look at that.  That's true, too.  You rock, Mom.  That's a mom.  Nothing wrong with that.  Gotta love it.  All right.  We're looking forward to seeing your pictures.  Take your Sam with you, and we'll set you up with some of the chilled Jaeger from in our office.  We have one of those machines to chill it down.  Oh, good.  If you need all the guys to leave the area when you're getting your shots done, no problem.  Whatever's comfy for you.  Yeah.  We want to make sure you're comfortable, okay?  Thank you.  Take it done out here.  Oh, yeah.  Right out front. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  The moms I'd like to have contests is starting to shape up, Anthony.  Look at that.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Look at that.  All right.  Who knew?  Let me go to David.  David, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  Listen, Paul Townstone definitely won the Santa.  She's definitely a mom who got F.  Oh, it's the moms we like to F, but not F the kids.  Not moms that are Fing their own foster kids.  Here's another example of the whole thing with, and believe me, I'm not saying Rosie O'Donnell's guilty of anything. 
[00:08:30]  What I am saying, it's that same thing, the single mom of questionable sexuality, adopting kids, getting foster children, and who's watching these moms?  You know?  Because if you ask me, it's like giving somebody the keys to a sex toy shop.  You know?  It's just like, okay, I'll take one of these.  Give me a little Vietnamese one. 
[00:09:00]  I'll take that Indian one and throw in a white kid.  That's fine.  I'll take those, wrap them up, I'll bring them home, because that's what I'm into sexually.  And then they just dole them out.  Man.  I think when you're in the entertainment field, they're a little more lax on the rules and background and stuff like that.  Just the visual of Paula Poundstone.  Hey, give me one of those, a couple of these, give me a chink.  I'll take one of those.  Yeah.  And send Paula Poundstone up with the whole schmear.  She's just a...  And no one's really saying what's going on. 
[00:09:30]  They said that she's been charged with a lewd act with a minor, a girl under the age of 14,  and then endangering the welfare of children and lewd acts with two girls and two boys.  So God only knows what atrocities have taken place in the Poundstone house.  It's just a visual I have in my head.  Paula Poundstone naked.  Oh.  Big raggedy bush.  That maddy peach. 
[00:10:00]  All gray.  You know when, like, you leave your dog out in the rain too long?  Right, right.  And it's all just maddy.  It's all like a madded old dog.  Come here, kid.  She's a man.  You are a kid, toucher!  You see her on stage?  Yeah, I've seen her on Comedy Central, HBO, whatever it is,  when they have the unfunny girls of comedy come up on stage.  You ever see that?  It's like, and now an HBO comedy exclusive.  You're like, oh, cool.  Maybe there'll be some good comics.  It's a night of divas of comedy. 
[00:10:30]  Clank!  See ya!  I cannot get off the channel fast enough.  Nothing less funny than female comics.  Sorry.  Will one or two of them have a good gag or a joke every so often?  Sure.  I'll give them that.  But for the most part, I don't want to hear about how their moms are upset  that they don't have a boyfriend yet.  Well, Paula, it's because you like young girls.  Maybe that's why you don't have a man yet.  Yeah, my mother's always annoying me, trying to ask me why I don't have a husband yet. 
[00:11:00]  I prefer the hairless little ones.  Why isn't anyone laughing?  This is my comedy ad.  So I've seen her on those shows, and you look at her.  She comes out wearing a man's suit.  I like the pantsuit.  Any woman that wears the pantsuit.  Well, the pantsuit is making a big comeback, Anthony.  You know, it's great if you're on trial for murder or something.  You want to walk in in the pantsuit into court.  That's fine.  But if you're up on stage and you're a woman doing an act or whatever you're doing, 
[00:11:30]  the pantsuit.  Or if your grandma going to, you know, your grandson's graduation.  You've already given up the sexuality at that point.  If you're a grandma and you're wearing your pantsuit, it's not like, hey, what, should I put on the hot pantsuit?  No, you've resigned to the fact that you're done.  You're done using your peach.  Anthony, what makes a hot pantsuit?  There is no, maybe on a very attractive woman and crotchless, a crotchless pantsuit, perhaps. 
[00:12:00]  Rosie, Paula, Ellen.  I bet you Carmen Electric could make a pantsuit look hot.  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.  Absolutely.  She's coming in, right?  Yep.  Right on.  But, you know.  Team Carol pantsuit?  What's, what's, and they took Paula Poundstone's kids and put them back in these foster home things.  I was saying, oh, someone's got to keep tabs on this.  It sounds all well, nice, and liberal.  You know what I mean?  Let people, whether they're gay or not, adopt children.  You know.  It's like a toy store out there for some of these people. 
[00:12:30]  Doug, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, Ed, is this the same ugly chick that's on that game show to tell the truth?  Yes, it is.  Yeah, she's one of the panelists on that.  Gee, God, I wonder if she's still going to be on it or whatever.  But she's just, I don't know what the hell would everyone want to F that or if it was a girl or a guy.  I mean, she must have tied them down or something.  Ed, yeah, just a visual in your head.  It's, ugh.  Thank you, Doug.  All right, see you.  All right, bye.  I'd like to adopt some children, yes.  All right, Dr. Smith, what do you like? 
[00:13:00]  I'd like three young hairless boys.  Oh, dear.  Woo!  All right, here you go.  You've been on TV, so I guess you're okay.  Hey, Paula Poundstone.  Anthony, I just got distracted because another hot mom has shown up for the Moms I'd Like to Have Contests.  What's her name?  Guns.  She's got huge, yeah, look at that.  Guns, you say.  And, of course, we share with our listeners, so you'll see all the pictures up on WNAW.com. 
[00:13:30]  Probably within the next hour, at least these two girls anyway.  Yeah.  Hopefully more moms on their way today, right?  Yes.  Let's go to Tommy.  Tommy, what's going on?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Did you know the Paula Poundstone story you were talking about?  Did you hear that she said that she wants, once they start talking, she wants to give them back?  And that she has pity for Mommy Dearest?  Yeah, she said that in the paper today.  Oh, my God, really?  She was saying, yeah, she has a little pity for Joan Crawford.  Exactly.  But I never, ever laughed at a female comedian in my life.  There's not one I ever liked in my life. 
[00:14:00]  They're horrible.  Nothing.  Nothing.  All right.  You guys are doing great.  Later, man.  Thank you, Tommy.  Sure.  All right.  I'm looking as, all of a sudden, I guess she's associated or was with this motherjones.com.  All of a sudden, she's taken off the side and we no longer have any association with Paula Poundstone.  We're going to have to wait and see.  I'm sure more details are coming on this one. 
[00:14:30]  Paula Poundstone is one of the most original and imaginative comedians in the country today,  choosing honesty and her own off-kilter worldview over the usual gender-biased topics of relationships, diets, men, or sex.  Please.  That's all she was doing.  She can be seen on the Rosie O'Donnell show, but they trade tips on how to keep them from growing old.  Ugh.  All right.  Well, we're just getting started.  We got good news, Anthony. 
[00:15:00]  What do we got?  Coming Tuesday to the Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah.  What are you laughing at?  What are you laughing at?  Something, right?  Black girl is wearing shorts.  Oh, you did?  Get the hell out of here.  He's very impressionable.  He's very impressionable.  Oh, he's very...  Look at him.  Yeah, but they're black shorts, so it still looks like he's wearing long pants.  Earl, did you...  Why?  Did you succumb to the pressure of your... 
[00:15:30]  We were goofing on you yesterday about you wearing black long pants and long-sleeved shirts,  so you decided to cool off a little today and maybe wear some shorts?  Yes.  Oh, you did?  I didn't even know you owned shorts.  I told you that...  Yes, I did.  I do own a pair of shorts.  I said I brought...  I told Opie when he came in today, I brought a pair of shorts.  You've got to wear shorts, though, that aren't the same color as your legs, because it still  looks like you're wearing long pants.  Check out those nifty shoes.  It looks like he works for Ups.  Yeah, the Ups. 
[00:16:00]  The guys that wear the brown shorts in the summer.  Well, Earl's got the brown pants on now.  What about the shoes, Earl?  Let me see what you're sporting on there.  Yeah, those boots.  What the hell, adult?  Oh, I used to wear those when I rode my jet ski.  Yeah.  So when you stepped off on the shallow water in a rocky area, you wouldn't cut up your  feet.  You're wearing...  You want to fight an Opie underwater?  You got the shoes for it.  Why not just wear flippers?  You're wearing...  Those are...  Those are like for the water.  You can wear them any time. 
[00:16:30]  Wear them on land.  You never know when you're going to...  They're better than sandals, which I hate.  Yeah.  Earl, you look great.  Very good.  Well, you know, you're working into it.  You're working into it.  Well, Earl's leaving, Anthony, because he's doing a wow sticker stop today at Sipperstein's.  Sip, sip, Sipperstein's.  Yes.  Earl, you're going to be there by 4.30?  Yes.  I went to get our guys so we can leave.  Earl, why do you wear sunglasses inside?  I'm getting ready to go outside.  Yeah, but you're not outside yet.  You still got to go in the dark hallway, a dark elevator.  And, Earl, we're going to take up a collection so you can get rid of the Tom Cruise sunglasses. 
[00:17:00]  I like my sunglasses.  Yeah, really.  Those things went out, like, in 80-whatever.  Did you get them at a wedding when they handed out the blow-up saxophones so all the guys  could get out on the floor and play the air guitar and blow up sax with the Tom Cruise  Risky Business sunglasses?  I'm going to replace them with a pair of vocalies.  There you go.  All right, Earl.  So, please, bring yourself up to 1990.  Yeah, you'll be at Sipperstein's 338 Route 9 North in Manalapan.  Manalapan.  I don't know how to say that one. 
[00:17:30]  Manalapan.  Manalapan, New Jersey, starting at 4.30, giving out the wow stickers.  All right?  You guys suck.  Hey, Earl.  Just take those old records off.  I've been listening to them by myself.  Hey, where are the white women at?  I got it from a needle.  Nigga, please.  Excuse me while I whip this out. 
[00:18:00]  There you go.  I like that old time of rock and roll.  I'm Big Dick Black.  All right.  There's Earl in shorts today.  Wait till you see this.  What?  Wait till you see.  Well, you were busting my balls because it was 95 and I was wearing pants.  I went, fine.  I'll bring a pair of shorts.  And now I'm wearing shorts.  You're like, why are you wearing shorts?  Earl, put on a different color.  That's all we want to see on you. 
[00:18:30]  You're a digital.  You make everyone hot around you.  And I don't mean hot.  I mean hot, heat hot.  You look like you're burning up.  Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make look.  All right, Earl.  People are already yelling at you on the phone saying there's no way you're going to get there by 4.30.  Well, they can go F themselves.  All right.  So why don't you leave and get to the wow sticker stop.  All right?  All right.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you.  We're tanks for nothing.  Anyway, good news for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:19:00]  Coming Tuesday.  Tuesday.  What do we got?  Cat fighting.  Oh, yes.  Cat fighting.  That woman, what's her name?  May.  Maylay.  Maylay.  Maylay called up yesterday, I guess, and said she does this naked cat fighting thing.  Girls naked fighting each other.  Teeth, nails, whatever it takes.  Yeah, it's all legit.  It's not cute cat fighting.  No.  It's hardcore.  And we were like, hey, come in now.  But they're coming in Tuesday? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  I think we should give out some invites.  Want to invite some lucky listeners?  We should invite some lucky listeners to hang with us Tuesday when we do cat fighting.  Ringside?  I think Fox News is coming by Tuesday, so that's a good show for them to shoot.  Cat fighting.  What else is going on with the cat fighting?  How many women are they bringing up?  I think they're bringing a couple right now.  They definitely have.  And we can invite, I guess, our own if we want.  Any ladies out there want to do some cat fighting?  Maybe some teen cat fighting?  Now, our own Steve, Steve C., stepped into the ring yesterday right outside our studio 
[00:20:00]  with an ultimate fighting champion.  Tino.  Tino Ortiz.  And I think anybody else that wants to come in, a girl, and do this cat fighting,  it would be a tribute to Steve.  Yeah.  Would I do?  Nothing.  You got your ass handed to you.  Yeah, I did.  Quickly.  But now, would you be willing to maybe get in the ring with one of the girl cat fighting  chicks?  Dude. 
[00:20:30]  Or do you just prefer the men?  Yes, I prefer the company of men when it comes to getting my ass handed to me.  I think the cat fighters are more dangerous, though.  Probably.  They're going to be working their nails and everything.  I don't want to beat up chicks, man.  Cat fighting Tuesday.  I can't wait.  I know.  Yeah, any girls that want to come up and try it out.  I think Rick would be better suited for fighting girls.  Don't.  But no, we're just going to try to get some ladies.  Yeah, we'll get some ladies.  Stinky.  Some of our female listeners will come down and show off their cat fighting skills on  Tuesday, okay?  Nice.  And you know what? 
[00:21:00]  We need teens.  Teen cat fighting.  Teen cat fighting.  Can I come down?  Because I like fighting girls.  The punch I threw on Robin Givens was the best punch I threw in my whole effing life.  Well, that's what you said in Maxim Magazine, Mike.  She flew across the room screaming until I knocked the breath out of her.  Breath.  P-H-T-R-L.  Breath.  See?  Mele's on the phone.  Mele!  Yeah.  We are so psyched for Tuesday.  You're not going to blow us off, right?  No, absolutely not. 
[00:21:30]  We have a history of people blowing us off on this radio show.  No, she sounds psyched.  Yeah, very important.  We're going to give you a big...  Legit.  Yeah, we're going to promote your upcoming cat fighting.  Yeah, that sounds great.  I mean, what we wanted mainly was to find out if somebody there wanted to be the judges and that was the whole thing.  However, if you've gotten involved with this, it's great because it gives us, you know, more...  Yeah, you'll have a lot...  You're going to have lots of exposure.  We wanted to open it to find out if there's any girls out there that wanted to participate. 
[00:22:00]  You know, I can give out a number.  If anybody from the audience wanted to challenge me, however, it has to be within limits because I'm not a big person.  We can do, you know, something with the audience.  So, Mele, you're going to be doing some cat fighting Tuesday yourself?  Yeah.  Nice.  And then you're bringing down, what, another lady?  We're bringing a couple of girls, depending on who wants to show up.  However, the producer and the promoter wanted to find out if we could have it videotape because they have a video magazine. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, no problem.  No problem.  So they can use it for their own purposes.  Yeah, no problem.  No problem.  All right, we'll work out all those details.  We're just psyched to have you guys Tuesday.  Because I need to know to put you guys on the guest list.  All right, hold on, okay?  Okay.  Go talk to Mele.  Don't read it.  That's why I said hold on.  Right.  Another lady showed up for the Moms I'd Like to Have Contest.  So why don't we take a break, Anthony?  We're just getting started.  I hear Adam Ferrari stopping by.  Moms coming down for the contest. 
[00:23:00]  Carmen Electra stopping by.  Jim Brewer maybe stopping in today.  Oh, that would be mad.  We haven't talked to Brewer in a long time.  It would be nice to say hi to him.  All right.  And more of your phone calls, 877-692-1027.  And action.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay.  Terrific.  And cut.  Opie.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.

[00:24:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Toll free.  877-692-1027.  We have three hot moms outside the studio.  They are entering the Moms I'd Like to F contest as we speak.  Angela's out there from the HBO Bellevue special.  And a lady named Pam with a huge hooter.  Yeah, you could describe her that way, sure.  A tiny little mom with blonde hair.  She's got a smoking body. 
[00:25:00]  Smoking.  And we'll have pictures up on WNAW.com.  Yes, Anthony?  Yes.  Very good.  Yes?  No, I was saying bombshell.  Oh.  You were looking at the screen like there might be something.  Oh, because people.  Okay, let me get this straight.  Opie says Carmen Electra is stopping by.  Ant is silent.  Opie says Jim Brewer might be coming by.  Ant yells, mint.  What a fag.  You've got to watch what you say or don't say around here, don't you?  I think I'm more excited to see what Brewer's been up to.  I haven't seen Brewer in a while.  He's a good friend. 
[00:25:30]  I mean, what are we going to do with Carmen Electra?  Wow, you're hot.  Yeah.  Look how hot you are.  There's hotness about you.  Oh, yeah, I know I'm hot.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, what are you doing?  I'm going to be part of this Ultimate Fighting Championship.  Cool.  Mm-hmm.  So, wow, you're hot.  Ask her about Rodman.  Nah, she's hanging with Dave Navarro these days.  Yeah, well, ask her about that, too.  I was just reading in, I think, FHM Magazine that she had sex with Dave Navarro in a sushi restaurant. 
[00:26:00]  Really?  Yeah, she just likes to have sex all the time.  That's hot.  So, I'm going to say, hey, I heard you had sex with Dave Navarro in a sushi restaurant.  And she'll go, yeah, it was really hot.  Yeah, it's hot.  Is Brewer here yet?  Nah, I'm looking forward to it.  Of course.  Anthony.  Yeah.  A lot of people asking if we're going to do something for the first anniversary of the launching of the bottle rocket out of the peach. 
[00:26:30]  Out of the coos.  Out of the coochie.  Yeah.  We like to call it coochie fireworks.  Yeah, the coochie fireworks.  You've heard of groochie, of course, but they don't take it to the limit that we do.  Hard to believe it was almost a year ago that we had a lady come down.  We haven't talked to her since.  I hope she still likes us.  Yeah.  She allowed us to fire a bottle rocket out of her bottle. 
[00:27:00]  Out of her you-know-what.  Yeah.  Put the stick of the rocket right there.  We set up a little blast deflector so she wouldn't get injured.  And let it loose.  Now, this is what I'm thinking.  A week from Saturday, we're doing an all-day road show at the Stone Pony in Jersey.  Cool.  A week from Saturday.  It's going to be great.  We have lots of stuff going on there.  We have to get a lady on stage to do that trick for us. 
[00:27:30]  Have to.  Yeah.  So someone's going to have to bring us a bottle rocket.  Don't bring mortars.  No, just, you know.  You can't fire a mortar.  Boom.  Just a bottle rocket.  Boom.  That would hurt.  If we could pull that off on that stage a week from Saturday, because there's going to be like 4,000 people there.  We did a bottle rocket.  You think this time we'd get an eight-ounce?  Something with a little more.  A little more thrust.  We could.  We'll start with a bottle rocket.  Denise is very pissed at us. 
[00:28:00]  What now?  Denise.  Yeah.  What's wrong?  You guys upset me today.  Why?  Because you guys are making generalizations about single gay women adopting kids.  All right.  Oh.  Well, we're talking about Paula Poundstone.  That's a disgusting story today.  Well, that's definitely disgusting.  And Ann said, Ann kind of, why am I getting feedback as I talk to you?  I don't know.  All right.  So what's the problem?  Well, I don't want you making generalizations like that. 
[00:28:30]  I thought you guys were cooler than that.  Single mom?  Single?  No, I'm not, actually.  Oh, okay.  I'm gay.  I am gay, though.  Okay.  I'm sure there's plenty of single moms out there that are adopting kids and having, you  know, perfectly normal relationships.  Definitely.  Yeah.  That's true.  But the Paula Pound story is just insane.  Yeah, that sucks.  That's wrong.  That makes a bad name for everybody.  I kind of think, like, when you get a lesbian couple or a gay men-on-men couple there, and  they're adopting kids, it's just, you know, your mind kind of thinks maybe something's 
[00:29:00]  going on there.  Yeah, but we're not all screwed up, you know.  Yeah, I believe the bees.  Okay.  And you think because two guys adopt a kid, there's something wrong?  No.  I think you get two guys, and they adopt a boy?  Oh, that's a little much right there.  I don't think, I don't know.  I don't think that's, no, I don't think that's too cool.  I think there are normal gay couples out there adopting kids, and there's no problems.  There's regular heterosexual couples that are adopting kids, and there's all sorts of 
[00:29:30]  shops of horrors going on.  It's a toy.  It's a toy for them.  The majority of pedophiles are straight, you know.  I'm sure there's a...  I'm sure there's a bunch of heterosexual people that adopt kids, and then they become  toys.  Right.  You're right.  I don't think you could generalize saying that it's just gay couples.  I don't disagree with that, but, you know, I think maybe we've got to take a closer look  at some of these situations.  I hear you.  You know, the people that have been on TV or something, all of a sudden they just grab 
[00:30:00]  up these kids, and God knows what's going on.  Yeah, well, I just want to make sure you guys aren't making a jackalization.  No, I'm not.  All right.  I am.  Anthony is.  I'm making the generalization.  I'm going to kick your butt.  Yeah, hard.  All right.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Robert wants in here.  Robert, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I got a Roman candle for you if you need it.  I live right down the road from the Stone Pony. 
[00:30:30]  No, a Roman candle's very dangerous.  I saw a guy holding a Roman candle in his hand once.  Yeah.  A couple went like, boom, boom, and then the whole thing went, boom, just exploded right  there in his hand.  Yeah, a rocket, I think, you know, you got a little time, if the thing isn't launching,  to kind of throw it.  We got to just get a bottle rocket.  Yeah, I got you, guys.  Let's get a rocket.  A bottle rocket will get the same reaction from the crowd.  All right, guys, stay black.  All right.  We also need a dunk tank for our road show a week from Saturday. 
[00:31:00]  Who's going in that?  Everybody.  I'm not getting in a dunk tank.  Not you, but, I mean, people will.  Oh.  Maybe we'll put Earl in the dunk tank.  That would be good.  He could say, go F yourself.  So we do need a dunk tank for the road show.  Yeah.  Everyone's saying we should use a Roman candle.  No.  We can't use a Roman candle.  They're very dangerous.  Hey.  Mike, we can't use a Roman candle.  Come on.  You guys got to.  They're very dangerous.  Dude, can't we get a guess so much?  Yeah, that made the radio.  All right, Mike.  Thank you. 
[00:31:30]  Jackass.  You ever read the directions on fireworks?  Place in coups.  Light fuse.  Get away.  The Rev wants in.  Rev.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, listen.  Who's this?  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony, let's go.  Speak.  Yo, Anthony, I'm proud of you for standing up to that bull dyke lesbian bitch.  At least you got balls.  Opie, you should do the same, man.  Don't take.  That's what I believe. 
[00:32:00]  I don't think, I don't think, forget it.  I'm not going to listen to your close-minded point of view, you idiot.  Are you talking to me now, Opie, or the caller?  Both of you.  Oh, that's nice, man.  I'm close-minded.  How come it's always a lesbian or a homo?  Lesbian wants to adopt a kid, and you think there's a problem with that?  Yeah, I do think there's a problem.  A kid needs a mother and a father.  What country were you raised in?  There's a lot of people that have moms and pops, and their lives didn't turn out too well, my friend. 
[00:32:30]  That's true.  I'll give them that.  You can't, you're right.  You can't generalize.  It's the year 2001.  Wake up.  Where are our flying cars?  This crap is going on.  There are gay couples, lesbian couples adopting kids, and the kids are turning out okay.  How do you know?  Yes, you're right.  Where's your study, Opie?  Oh, I don't know that.  I see footage of the gay parade.  I can just imagine a guy in a leather cop suit and another guy dressed like an Indian making out in front of a small impressionable child at the home. 
[00:33:00]  At the homo.  You can't generalize.  You just can't generalize.  I'm sure some of that's going on as well, but...  I don't think it's a healthy environment for children.  There's also normal gay couples adopting kids, and their lives are just fine.  Normal gay couples.  That's an oxymoron.  Normal gay.  Well, that's what...  To them, that's normal, Rev.  Yeah, but all I'm saying is, if a kid starts out in that environment, he's already got a big strike against him. 
[00:33:30]  There you go.  Because he's different.  Not because it's wrong.  All right, Rev.  It's because you know how brutal kids are.  You're right, Rev.  That's true.  You guys are the best.  You're right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Imagine a poor kid going to school, and he's got the parent-teacher conference, and here  come two daddies.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, O.N.?  Hey, man.  First of all, I hope you're a nice impression of Mike Tyson.  All right.  Yeah, yo, look.  Don't listen to that woman.  I'm going to get you in trouble.  You can't listen to that woman, Denise. 
[00:34:00]  You could say you're generalizing or whatever, but percentage-wise, when you talk about pedophiles,  you're always going to be talking more homosexual, I mean, at least with the men and the women.  I mean, when's the last time you heard about a lot of, like, like, for instance, priests?  You always hear about the priests and the boys.  You never hear about the, you know, the lesbians.  Right, except for today with Paula Poundstone.  Yeah, except for today with Paula Poundstone.  I'm just saying that percentage-wise, you're going to talk more homosexuals, not number-wise,  obviously, because there's less homosexuals than regular straight people. 
[00:34:30]  That's all I had to say.  All right.  All right.  You guys suck.  Take care, man.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Watch later on in the program as me and Opie completely change our viewpoints.  Let's go, Chris.  What's up?  Yeah, what's up, Opie and Anthony?  Anthony, I'm on your side, man.  I'm telling you right now, it's Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.  Opie, you're a homo.  That old gag.  Adam and Steve.  Yeah, Chris, I'm a homo for having an open mind, you idiot.  Just don't have an opened behind. 
[00:35:00]  That's right.  Gay Marker, what's up?  Hey.  Oh, it didn't sound like a very, uh, Marco, you're certainly not going to help this argument.  Gay Marker.  Yeah?  Would you adopt a young boy?  Not unless he was like 14 and very muscular.  See?  Now, thanks for helping me out, Marco.  Marco, you fag.  Be honest.  Do you look at young boys and pick out ones that are attractive or ones that you...  Honestly, I really do.  I hate to say it.  See?  I do, but I do have a cutoff point. 
[00:35:30]  What's your cutoff point?  Nine?  Like 16.  No, no, no.  Like 16 years.  They start to look really cute at 16, but I would never, ever, like, do anything.  I would never do anything.  I mean, but they look so cute.  That's a winner.  They're so adorable.  Right.  Hey, thanks, Marco.  I'm sorry.  I'm, like, really sick today.  I've had the...  I've, like, been trying to recover for a week from the parade.  I'm still not well. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, now, Marco, you went to the gay parade here in New York City.  Oh, my God.  I've been sick for four days.  I haven't had a normal bowel movement in four days.  Oh, man.  What were you doing at the gay parade?  You name it.  Everything.  Oh, my God.  How much gay, man-on-man sex did you have?  I lost count of the orgy.  You went to an orgy afterwards?  Yes.  A gay orgy?  Sunday night.  Sunday night.  Oh, my God.  How many different men would you say you were with? 
[00:36:30]  I don't know.  Maybe, like, 14 or 15.  Oh, my God.  That wasn't the orgy, though.  Oh, I've been, like, sick for days.  I'm so sick.  Do you have to get your stomach pumped like Ron Stewart?  I think so.  I've just been, like...  That ain't a gag.  Really?  I had too much to drink.  I did too much everything.  Oh, bent over.  It looked like a cannoli.  And I'm supposed to go to Provincetown next week, and I'm, like, not well. 
[00:37:00]  How much is this a party in Provincetown?  What, are you laying on your stomach because you can't sit down?  I'm, like, I'm just, like, rolling around.  I can't do anything.  Oh, it's just ravaged.  Oh, God, it's horrible.  It's just been ravaged.  You know it's bad when you start smelling hair burning from the friction.  And let me tell you.  Oh, no.  I'm never going to tell you.  It's disgusting.  Why?  Go ahead.  If you know what the smell of man...  Right.  Just leave it at that. 
[00:37:30]  ...stuff smells like...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my...  That could be the sickest thing I've ever heard on this radio show.  That has got to be the sickest thing I've ever heard.  Holy...  Holy...  Thank you, Marco, for that.  Me, Brad.  Me, Brad.  You're welcome.  All right.  I have to go drink some water right now because I'm not well.  All right, Marco. 
[00:38:00]  You are...  All right.  Read my column at foundrymusic.com.  It's bye.  Weekly.  All right.  Bye.  Freaking bag.  You want to make out or something?  There goes Marco.  Still recuperating from the gay pride parade.  That happened, what, four days ago now?  Five days ago?  That guy, you know, we think he's great.  He's been on the show.  But I'm so surprised that guy doesn't have, like, 18,000 diseases.  He's like a depository.  Oh, man. 
[00:38:30]  Oof.  I need to go lay down.  I thought the Paula Poundstone visual was bad.  Marco with just 14 different men.  It's like a legion.  See?  You want that, adopting small children?  You can watch.  Oh, how's that for a topper?  Hey, Marco.  Oh, here it comes.  Oh, ho, ho.  All right.  Hey, where are the other two moms? 
[00:39:00]  We should say hi to them.  Are they getting their pictures taken?  One mom is just hanging out with thong panties on outside the door.  Yeah, who is that?  I'm just seeing an ass coming.  Nice.  Wow, look at that.  Four kids.  Yeah.  How'd you do that?  How'd your pictures come out?  I got some nice shots.  They said pretty decent.  I didn't see anything.  Awesome.  All right, cool.  Very cool.  Okay.  Very good.  It's good.  You're feeling it now, right?  Yeah.  A couple of Sams.  A couple of Sams.  A couple of shots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm hearing a rumor that we're going to try to get something else going today, maybe. 
[00:39:30]  Maybe.  That would really be nice.  Is she into it?  Right here.  I don't know.  She didn't indicate anything, so.  She's hot, though.  Yeah.  This mom wants to get together with another mom on the lesbian couch.  Lesbian couch.  No babies, right?  Can't make another baby.  Right.  We can't.  Mom on mom.  Mom on lesbian couch.  Oh, my God.  And here's the mom that she wants to be with.  Hey, how you doing?  We should break the news toward live on the radio.  I'm being sick. 
[00:40:00]  Hey, Pam.  What's up?  Hi, how are you?  Hey, Pam.  Very good.  Good.  Look how hot Pam is.  Yeah.  You're a mom?  Yeah.  I'm a mom.  And she needs at least two more shots.  A couple of shots.  You've been partaking?  Another beer.  That's a good shot.  Let me see the shots, Rick.  They're going to be up on WNAW.com.  Oh, yeah.  Look at you.  I do believe we have a finalist with that picture.  Don't say that.  Yeah, you've always named a finalist.  The famed finalist.  They're all on to the finalist.  But we're really serious there. 
[00:40:30]  We know.  We mean it there.  This time we mean it.  Now, how many kids do you have?  Two.  Two kids at age?  My daughter's 10 and my son's going to be 13.  Look at that.  See that?  Can I ask you a question?  Are those real?  Absolutely.  Are they really?  Are they really?  Wow.  Good.  After two kids at all?  Wow.  I breastfed.  And you breastfed?  Absolutely.  Lucky the kids in the world.  Lucky right there.  Mama.  What size are those?  I'm usually pretty good.  I know you are.  But you've got like a 34 back? 
[00:41:00]  32 maybe.  No.  36?  Yeah.  Those are double Ds at least.  Well, I've been wearing Ds.  No wonder they're so tight.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's a full D then.  Vitamin D.  Did she get her picture taken yet?  I've got her team.  Not yet.  What are you wearing for the pictures?  I have a choice of three costumes.  Costumes?  She calls them costumes.  You've got a lot of the kids at school when you go to the school looking at your son's  friends maybe or anything like that.  Maybe they'll get a little older. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah?  And then they'll start appreciating what their friend's mom looks like.  Well, my son and my daughter are both away.  Oh, are they?  It works out well, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Do you know that she thinks you're really hot?  Yeah.  So does the other girl in the bathroom.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Look at you.  Three-way lesbian couch.  Yeah.  Oh.  I've been approached by the lesbian couch already.  Yeah?  Are you thinking about it?  Yeah.  The other girl approached you?  Yeah.  Oh, because she wants to approach you.  She is, and actually we had a very, yes, she's wonderful. 
[00:42:00]  She's very cute.  We could do that, Angela.  We could do like a three-way.  Now, let me just explain something about the lesbian couch so as not to scare anyone  off.  The lesbian couch is just a place where the girls can go and take anything as far as  they want.  There's never any pressure.  It's a good first step into the wonderful world of lesbianism.  And look at Marianne's boyfriend.  Husband.  Husband.  Sometimes they just make out, and other times they're just unbelievable. 
[00:42:30]  They can make out now.  Oh, he can.  A little touching, a little, whatever, whatever you guys want to do.  It's always up to the girls on the couch how far they want to go.  Wow.  Look at you.  The cutie pie.  Look at you.  I'll move.  Angela.  Angela from the HBO Bellevue special.  She's decked out in camouflage shorts, a little camouflage bikini tie.  I am so excited to meet her.  Isn't that great, right?  And she's completely normal.  Go figure.  She is. 
[00:43:00]  She is normal, man.  Very good.  We got three fine moms for this contest today.  I hope more moms show up.  Yeah.  So any possibility of a couple girls going on the lesbian couch today?  Angela.  Angela, you would be in tonight?  Yeah.  All three.  Get them more Sam Adams.  Three girls saying there's a different possibility.  Sam and Jägermeister.  Mom's on the lesbian couch today.  We will make that happen.  We will make that happen.  We will make that happen.  And you girls, like I said, whatever you girls want to do, the three is very attractive. 
[00:43:30]  And I see no, like, favorite in here.  You know what I mean?  Like, sometimes we've had lesbian couch scenes where there's one, like, men deal come in.  And the other two girls are like, Jesus Christ, what are you, killing us here?  This just looks like it's going to be a great combination.  Sam Adams.  A truly great beer.  Look at that, right?  It's like my great-grandfather used to say.  To get three girls to do lesbianism on a couch, you need my Sam Adams. 
[00:44:00]  Now, let me grab my long-neck bottle in my lap.  Very nice.  That's good.  And, of course, the Jäger, whatever you girls want or need to loosen up a little bit, that's fine.  You want some Jäger?  Does it go well with the Prozac?  Oh, stop, Opie.  I was just saying to Angela before.  I'm going to get a little sleepy now.  I was saying to Angela before, like, they taped her at Bellevue.  Right.  And you're watching and just go, oh, my God, she's going crazy, you know? 
[00:44:30]  There's another crazy person at Bellevue.  And then I thought about it.  You could tape people at a party drunk and get more stuff than she did at Bellevue.  That's true.  I mean, how many parties have you been to where people are like,  You're like, wait, you're hammered.  But put it on videotape, and it's worse than anything you were doing.  I don't know how they pegged you.  Are you on meds right now there, Angela?  Nah.  I've been on meds for about two and a half years.  Well, get on the Sam Adams med. 
[00:45:00]  All right, ladies, get your pictures taken so we can move on to the lesbian couch, possibly.  Very nice.  We will turn off all cameras for that.  My boyfriend's going to get mad at me, but.  That's all right.  It's not like another guy.  Sucks to be him.  Don't worry about it.  I just wanted to tell you about me taking her other virginity.  Recently.  Two nights ago.  Oh, wait a minute.  You mean the flip side.  Yeah.  So you were.  13 years later.  Wait, how old are your kids again?  14, 10, 6, and 2. 
[00:45:30]  So now, what's the name of the 14-year-old?  No, I can't say that.  Don't say that.  I just want to tell him that his mommy had.  Oh, wait, I heard her.  No.  No, let me get this straight.  He might have heard.  You guys, you know, you're having your sex and stuff over the course of your marriage,  and all of a sudden, two nights ago.  We've tried before.  Oh, and then it was like, eh, no, you know.  No, it's more like.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, but it's like immediate orgasm.  Wow.  Yeah.  Did she say that? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, you could say that, sure.  It's, you know, very clinical.  But what finally turned it around for you?  Margarita.  What finally?  Margarita.  You've got to love tequila.  I didn't even ask.  Does anyone know that?  It does.  It's the literal translation.  That's hysterical.  Wow.  That's something.  And it was very good, right?  It was very good a couple times.  Wow.  It was like a 15-year-old.  Yeah.  And how would you know that, sir? 
[00:46:30]  It's been a while.  Okay.  It's Paul Townstone.  You should talk.  Yeah, wow.  What can I say?  We hear it.  We hear it.  What you like.  I hear, yeah.  All right.

All you heard was what happened, and then all of a sudden,  you heard all everybody in the background go, oh.  He was complaining about, you know,  what smell of a man byproduct would be.  And let's just say the next day as you're disposing of it. 
[00:47:30]  That's all.  All right, man.  I got an idea.  You should get one of the moms to play with in my pants.  We pretty much know what's in their pants.

[00:50:00]  Brewer!  Brewer!  I like the dirty little birdies we got going on here.  Lot of ass.  Lot of ass.  I'll tell you what, I've had swamp ass for the last four hours.  Have you?  Why?  Why?  Because it's 98.  Yeah, you get cranky ass.  No, you get swamp ass.  Swamp ass.  I understand.  Swamp pimples.  Oh!  Ow!  You got to watch out.  You don't build up a fragrance back there, you know?  This weather will make you violent.  No, it's going to happen. 
[00:50:30]  No, it's going to happen when you take your underwear off later.  What is going to happen?  It's going to look like a shoeshine rack.  Take it off.  Let's see what you got.  So, yeah, we got some fine looking, uh...  Those are all moms out there, Jim.  Are they really?  This is a mom contest.  Yeah, take a gander.  Yeah, it's the moms that like to have contests.  That's a mom?  That's a mom.  Can you believe it?  Of like 13 and 14 year old kids.  And those are...  Oh, I know!  Adam Ferrara in the studio now.  Oh, I see you. 
[00:51:00]  Adam Ferrara, what's up, bro?  Whose mother is that?  You see that?  You see my mom, I'm going to get her naked.  Brewer brought his mom.  You know something?  Brewer comes in, and I look and go, Brewer brought his mom with him.  His mom is right outside, and there's things going on out there that, you know, I don't  know.  I know my own mother turns this show on.  That's not maternal instincts going on out there.  No.  You see those boobs?  Those are real.  That's in your Paula Poundstone family of mothering.  Rosie O'Donnell, mother. 
[00:51:30]  It's unbelievable.  Maybe we got Rosie down here.  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  That's what we want to see.  We want Rosie O'Donnell.  Try to get Rosie down here.  We want to see a flatso.  So, please.  Yeah.  So, we're going to have those pictures up on WNAW.com.  What were you thinking?  Is your mom cool with stuff like this?  Oh, my mom's crazy.  Yeah?  She's out of her mind.  Because I'm looking, you know.  And my sister, my sister's...  That's your sister right there, right?  Yeah.  Right on.  There you go.  See, that was an accident.  She's like in her 50s.  I was a little...  Oh, you weren't supposed to be really?  Yeah, born?  Yeah, that was one of...  You mean it was supposed to be oops, Brewer. 
[00:52:00]  My mom's like 40, 41.  Hey, Brewer, keep your sister away from Adam.  It doesn't seem to stop him.  Oh.  When did this happen?  He'll date your sister at the drop of a hat.  What happened?  What happened?  You know, you should have a vape.  It was many years ago, Brewer.  We were hanging out like we grew up together.  And his sister liked me, and we went out.  Oh, that's what it was.  Yeah.  Well, what was it? 
[00:52:30]  No, okay.  Anthony promised me his sister so I wouldn't invade his land.  What do you think it was?  Some kind of arranged thing.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You didn't have to accept.  Could have just said...  I asked permission.  I went to the Joe Buck Anthony Council.  Look, my intentions are pure.  I mean you with no disrespect.  Were you like the king of the block?  No.  It was just, you know, it was a group we hung out with and stuff. 
[00:53:00]  And then, you know, you could say things like,  Hey, look, I'm really good friends with your brothers and stuff.  And I don't think it would be appropriate.  But Adam didn't have that in his vocabulary.  I asked you first, and I got a dowry of two sheep.  You dropped subtly like, Hey, your sister's growing up.  Your sister's hot.  Don't even think about it.  Yeah, that's what happened.  You know?  She liked me.  All right.  Well, ooh.  See, I thought you were talking about 50 years old.  And he had him with his brothers.  What am I going to do there? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, you can't even get him with a payback.  I'm sorry.  I got a couple of cousins you can look at.  Louise is hot.  Oh, God bless you.  You go out with my mother, first thing you do is going to get a thank you note from my father.  I swear to God, I asked him the other day.  I said, Pop, how's married life?  He goes, Ah, it's killing me.  But I'm not giving up.  She ain't going to win.  I'm telling you right now.  My dad always said, Dad, how's marriage life?  He goes, Put it this way.  My day exists with a pork chop and a good crap. 
[00:54:00]  That's a good thing.  My father's a diabetic.  I go, How you doing?  How am I doing?  Every morning I pee on a stick.  How do you think my life is?  It's, Oh, I hope it's purple.  It's, you know, it's the little things in life.  I got a crap.  It's the little things in life that make you happy at that age.  My father doesn't even answer the phone anymore.  I go, Pop, don't you hear the phone ringing?  It's never good news.  Leave it alone.  It'll stop.  I got a little big joke.  Hey, Brewer, does your mom smoke pot or what? 
[00:54:30]  No, she never did.  No?  Did your mom?  No.  Did you ever smoke pot or no?  Give a thumbs up or thumbs down.  No?  You're a dirty liar.  I will say this.  Look at her right now.  You see my mom?  Well, we can put her on the air for a sec.  No?  She's 75.  Yeah, sure, Ma.  Come here for a second.  We'll be nice.  It doesn't matter.  She'll come right back at you.  Oh, really?  Brewer's mom.  Ma, come here.  Brewer's mom.  Brewer's mom.  How are you?  Do you remember when you got hammered when you were in the city?  She came.  Now, look at my mom.  So, did my daughter.  No, no.  You got wrecked. 
[00:55:00]  First of all, it's five in the morning.  Yeah.  No, two in the morning.  What are you talking about?  Ma, it was five in the morning.  This is what I hear, like, you know, when, like, you were trying to sneak in as a kid?  Right, yeah.  This is what I hear.  This is, okay, I hear the door open.  I hear this.  I did not do that.  Jesus Christ!  I thought it was four!  I thought it was four!  I can't get my pants off! 
[00:55:30]  I can't get my pants off!  I can't get my pants off!  She fell out of a cab into a puddle?  You think I'm lying?  Did you not do that in the village?  I thought we fell off the curb into this place.  Oh, much better.  What's your poison, Mrs. Brewer?  Oh, what do you like?  Martinis?  Martinis.  What do you like, the absolute, or, uh...  No.  No?  Dry.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I would like straight up, extra dry.  Just a little vamoose. 
[00:56:00]  Not too much.  No, I'm shinky food.  Uh-oh.  Who is she calling into the studio?  My daughter that was with me when we fell in the gutter.  Did you both fall in the gutter?  Yes, we did.  Your sister fell in the gutter, too?  Yes, she did.  Her sister fell in the gutter.  My sister gets just as hammered.  Really?  She hasn't done it in a long time.  And her husband had to pick us out and put us in the cab.  Oh, my God.  She's like Arthur. 
[00:56:30]  75.  Sorry.  74.  74.  You're 74?  Yeah.  You're quite a firecracker at 74.  I've got to tell you that.  Wow.  Show us the moves.  No!  Jim!  Jim!  Stop it now!  He says, Jim, stop it now!  Well, I met your mom.  We should put your mom...  Oh, I know.  Oh, they do the party right there.  My mom...  Tear ass up.  My mom, I take her to see Jim Brewer at the Vanderbilt a couple of months back. 
[00:57:00]  She is so hammered.  She's just, Jim, I love you.  I love you.  You are the greatest thing.  And she's hanging on him like, Mom, either take him in the back room or stop right now because...  I would do you.  But you know what?  I don't know if I want to do you.  I would do you.  I would do you.  I would do you.  I would do you.  I would want to.  Oh, that's great.  You'll offer Brewer your mother, but I can't date your sister.  Hey, you did.  Yeah, oh, my mother just out of control.  But these two together would probably be quite the item. 
[00:57:30]  Falling out of cabs all over the city.  Now, just one point.  Just one?  Yes.  And...  We managed to get home.  Yeah, that's all that counts.  I fell out of the car.  She couldn't get her pants off.  I had to come in there.  I had to take my mother's pants off.  Oh, my God.  Well, I took your pants off for 34 years.  Jim, she didn't come home after being out.  Jim.  Jim, after being out with friends, she didn't come home with dick written on her forehead like you.  No, unfortunately.  What's on your face? 
[00:58:00]  You said dick all over your face.  She used to show up.  She knew I'm getting wrecked or like around the corner.  You know, your friend would come pick you up.  Like, yo, man, we'll take a drive around the corner.  Yeah, you got it.  This effort would show up when you are peaking.  You know, when you're like, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Life sucks.  Get out of the goddamn car now!  Get out!  And who are these whores you hit you with?  You know, we did that?  Yes, I remember.  There were girls with you? 
[00:58:30]  She hunted me down in a pizza place.  These chicks are whores.  Get them out of here, all of them, right now.  Don't look at me like that, Missy.  You're a whore.  Oh, my God.  She's a whore, Norman.  My best friend was Joe, and she's like, and Joe, I'm very disappointed in you humping that girl against the wall at Shane's Pizza.  You think I'm lying?  No, I did do that.  Oh, my God.  This is like a therapy session for Joe. 
[00:59:00]  Isn't it?  What a coincidence.  They get in the car, and he said, you're embarrassing me.  I said, you haven't seen anything yet.  This is out in the street.  You know, Queens.  Yeah, very embarrassing.  The brothers are watching, just having a field day.  Yo, yo, that nigga be wrecking out by his mother.  My mom's be wrecking.  That nigga be taken down by his mom, Joe.  My mom be taking that nigga down.  No, she's falling in the gutter. 
[00:59:30]  She's falling.  Oh, snap.  You call that bitch a whore?  Were they whores, Jim?  Yeah, they were.  Mom, how did you know they were whores?  You can tell.  You can just tell.  Yeah, they had that look.  They had the look?  Yeah.  Right, they had that look.  Reputation.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And you were disappointed in his friends.  See, my mother was never disappointed in Anthony.  I expected from him.  I know.  I was like, I was a great thing for Adam to have around,  because it made him look so good in the eyes of his parents. 
[01:00:00]  That'd be around him.  And the other one with the tattoo.  Why can't you be like Adam?  Be like Adam.  Adam, I know you're good friends with Joseph,  but please don't take his example with the tattoos.  Right.  Okay?  They look good.  It's fine for him.  For now.  But not you.  You're not tough.  That's fine.  Put an earring in your ear.  Oh, did he get the earring?  Did you have an earring, bro?  What's wrong?  Mom, what's wrong with the earring?  I didn't care.  Oh, you didn't care?  Cool.  If my son wants to be a faggot, that's his business. 
[01:00:30]  Well, that's what my dad did.  Yeah, my dad was not happy when I got...  But he doesn't yell.  He just gives you that look like...  Faggy.  Jesus Christ.  Why didn't you go stick a donkey down your throat and just end the day?  Put on a skirt and put the...  Fag it in.  I fought in World War II for this stuff.  For an earring.  Did you get a tattoo?  Do you have a tattoo, bro?  No.  Oh, I was too scared for that.  I told my father, I said, you know, I think I want to get a tattoo. 
[01:01:00]  My father said, you better tattoo a new address on your arm because you ain't living here.  They all got that smart-ass remark, you know?  Yeah, we like that.  Hey, we were going to ask your mom if she, you know, did you used to smoke the wacky tobacco?  Never.  Never.  Never did that, right?  I'm very virtuous.  Yeah.  And you raised a Jim Brewer.  And I raised five bad children. 
[01:01:30]  You were the leader.  You're probably very proud, though, right?  Yeah, I am.  Hey, did you really have a dog named Duffy?  Yes, we did.  Little Duffy.  Little Duffy.  He used to hang out underneath the table.  Mookie?  Mookie.  And I'm not going to tell you who I call him.  Mookie Wilson?  Mookie.  Right on.  I'm not going to tell you.  Gee, let me think.  Was he black?  Yes.  Okay.  That's all he needed to know.  No, he was a right fielder. 
[01:02:00]  Duffy!  And you had to clean the crap off of the back of Duffy in the later years?  I didn't do that.  No, Jim had to do that.  Before you go out, wipe the crap off Duffy's tail.  And no goddamn drinking tonight.  I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm not!  You would have to say that.  Preface it before you went out.  No, I'm not drinking.  Was he a big drinker there, Mom?  Jim?  I think so.  Yeah?  Out with his friends and stuff.  I never came home drunk. 
[01:02:30]  Oh.  Well, you know what was cool?  It was like, she would be passed out.  Because you would have two, three martinis at 10 p.m.  I could be humping someone right on the couch.  My mother would be right next to me.  But I woke up.  My dad's six-pack in.  My dog, wiping his ass.  I'm, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, my God.  She wouldn't wake up for hours. 
[01:03:00]  But what would happen is, what would happen is in the morning, my dad, my dad was a sanitation  worker.  So he would get up about 4.35, Dad.  And he'd always get up.  And this is where I'd get, hey, jackass, get up, get up.  You know, I just fell asleep a half hour ago.  Still says nice head dick all over my face.  And he goes, hey, last night, were you all effed up?  I go, no.  He goes, your ass.  The car's in the bushes.  That's where your mother wakes up, you jackass.  That was the dead giveaway, man. 
[01:03:30]  Because there have been days you come outside and you go, I did not park my car like that.  You know, and you kind of remember trying to parallel park or something or pull it in  the driveway.  And you were really paying attention.  I got to get a little closer to the curb.  I'm good like this.  Why?  You come out.  You're in the middle of the road.  Your car's backed into the curb.  I like two feet up.  Two feet away from the curb on an angle.  It's like, wait, you couldn't even straighten it out.  This day you come out and that's not my car. 
[01:04:00]  Not only is it parked all left up, that isn't even my car.  In the middle of the night you hear, what the hell?  What's a dick?  Nice pork job, dick.  You come out.  I didn't push.  Someone moved it, man.  You got it easy.  My father used to go to bed when I had to be home at 11 o'clock.  I said, Pop, I'll be home.  He goes, you're going to be home at 11 o'clock.  I'm setting my alarm.  I'm going to bed.  I'm setting my alarm for 10.59.  You better turn it off before I do. 
[01:04:30]  That's a good idea.  Look at that.  A little late.  That is a good one.  Yeah.  Well, we used to, well, the first time drinking it, she was up.  You know, like those nights you just go out and it just happens?  It's just like, oh my gosh, 4.30.  What happened, man?  Where's my pants and my money?  Who's the dirty Mexican chick?  She's a whore.  So, yeah, I came home the first night where I really went drinking. 
[01:05:00]  I came home.  It was like 3 in the morning and she was waiting at the door.  You know, this is a friend's field day.  His mom's off.  What a faggot.  What a faggot.  What a faggot.  And the whole time she's yelling, Jesus, Jesus, this is what I made you to be.  My dad was cool.  He's like, please, he don't know where he's at.  Wait till the morning for Christ.  It's kind of traumatic for a mom the first time you come home all left up. 
[01:05:30]  Well, he was the youngest and I went through that before with quite a few of them.  She looks at her daughter in the corner.  My sister drove, my sister, which my mom didn't find out until like a year.  Or did you find this out yet?  My sister.  Oh, no.  Wrecked the garage door?  Yes.  She tried to sneak out with the car.  This is a nice head move, Doreen.  She gets in the car with her friends and she's not sure how to start the car yet. 
[01:06:00]  Whatever.  She starts the car, starts rolling too far.  Car starts coming.  She doesn't know.  She panics.  Right through my garage.  Right through the garage.  Nice way to sneak.  Right through the garage door comes down and she's like, I didn't know what happened.  It's just broke.  It has to three, four more teeth.  That just is broke.  You fell for that once about two years ago.  I fell for it for a while and then I thought, oh, no, they're lying again.  Isn't it fun when years later you come forward with some of these stories to your parents? 
[01:06:30]  All of a sudden your brain says, they're lying.  Yeah.  That's right.  Oh, if you think I'm a big Mets fan, which they do suck.  It's fine.  What do you think of Piazza's new hairdo?  I have a hard time defending myself getting from diehard Yankee fans.  Dude.  Give me an F.  Give me an A.  Give me a double G.  Must I continue? 
[01:07:00]  Nice hair.  D-double-E-K.  Dick.  Come on.  Man.  Well, anyway.  Help us out.  Get that hair back to normal.  First time we moved to, we moved down to Florida in like 86, 87.  First time I come down there, I moved back to New York.  First time I come visit back, you know, we got our dog Mookie.  The Mets are playing the Cubs.  I don't realize our neighbor is from Chicago.  Right?  What was she on?  What was whoever? 
[01:07:30]  Tom and whatever her name is.  So we're on in Chicago right now.  She's watching.  Hey, what's up, Chicago?  That's all right.  I'm sure it's a nice story.  No, go ahead.  Hey, Chicago rules.  So anyway, she goes like this.  She goes, whatever.  The Mets hit her, whatever.  They score some runs or whatever.  She opens up the sliding glass door, and she goes running out into the patio area.  I'm like, what the hell is she doing?  She runs to the fence of the neighbor's yard.  Take that, you goddamn cubbies, fam, and go back to Chicago where you're from. 
[01:08:00]  And the Cubs suck.  Way to go, Milky!  Am I exaggerating?  No.  Strike three!  And there's a bad call?  This damn guy is from Chicago.  They pay him off.  That's what monsters are from, Chicago.  And they're paying off the damn cubbies.  They do.  They do.  To this day, they do.  They're sort of the brave.  Yeah.  We all know that. 
[01:08:30]  Die hard Mets fan, huh?  Sorry to hear that.  Too bad.  We're having a tough year.  It's a tough year for the Mets.  We're done.  We're done.  We're just done.  Jim, matter of fact, your office called me asking if I want some Mets tickets from you.  I haven't even called you back.  I can't give away.  I can't go in Yahoo.  I'm just so depressed.  I'm going Yahoo.  Anyone want fireworks night?  No.  Hey, McGuire's coming.  Nice.  I'll watch it on TV.  Can't even make fun of Rocker anymore at Shea Stadium. 
[01:09:00]  You can't do anything.  What are you going to do?  Yankees are gone.  There's nothing to do but fight Mexicans.  So why are you guys in town today?  There you go.  Inappropriate, Belle.  Mom, why are you in town?  I'm visiting him.  Just hanging?  I decided to come in and try to keep him in line.  Yeah, good luck.  We're just hanging.  I'll tell you.  That's cool.  We're hanging.  We have other moms.  What's that about?  It's just jam.  It's just, you know, it's like a festival.  It's awards.  People jam.  You're hosting it, right?  Yeah.  Can the public go? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, it's beyond.  Oh, sold out and all that.  Okay, cool.  So we don't have to talk about that.  No, we don't talk about that.  But we could talk about Caroline's if you have nothing to do.  Ah, Adam.  Yeah, tonight through Sunday.  Tonight through Sunday, live.  Comedy so loud.  Your cast calls a rumble in Japan.

There's a million reasons to join.  Opie.  Anthony.  Opie.  Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W. 
[01:17:30]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Toll free.  8-7-7-6-9-2-1-0-2-7.  We go from Brewer to the lovely Carmen Electra, Anthony.  Yeah.  And everyone's like, you're going to be nice, right?  Where's that lady?  She doesn't want to talk.  Publicist, right?  Yeah.  She doesn't want to talk.  She doesn't want to talk.  Well, you know what?  She's been in here before, and that was the problem.  She walked in to a firestorm last time. 
[01:18:00]  She was taking Tony Danza upstairs to the news station, 10-10 Winds.  Someone saw Tony and figured we'd have Tony come in on our show.  But at the time, we were doing the Motley Crue Challenge with two very big girls.  And they were naked on the couch.  You've got to explain it to Carmen Electra.  Oh, God.  Watch this reaction.  Now, I've got to blame this squarely on the guys from Motley Crue.  They were in here, and they had this challenge.  It's they take a huge double-ended sexual device, and there's a $100 bill in the middle. 
[01:18:30]  And the first girl to reach the money wins.  Come on.  And it's Motley Crue.  You're not talking about a church group.  It's like a reverse tug-of-war.  Right.  Nice, right?  So all of a sudden, Tony Danza walks in, and the publicist was like, oh, my God.  What the hell is going on in here?  So when you came in, she was like, be nice.  And we're like, why?  What did we do?  Because I didn't remember she was in here that day.  And then she reminded us that we might have stepped over the line for the likes of Tony Danza being in here. 
[01:19:00]  We're being nice to you right now because there's a few moms out there that want to do the lesbian couch, which is in the corner.  Really?  Yeah.  And this, the blame can just be placed on us.  Yeah.  It's a couch in the corner and girls that want to experiment with each other, do that.  Look.  She's like, why did I book her on this show?  God damn it.  Could have went to G100 or something.  They don't do that.  We don't get this crap on Regis. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  No, but it's very loose.  It's just fun in here.  We try to have a good time and fun as the publicist looks on.  Oh, God.  I hate when publicists have to look on.  I know, and they have to be in here during these things.  Did you see that look she just gave?  All the plants just died.  So you're doing something with the ultimate fighting.  That's right.  And what are you doing with ultimate fighting?  The ultimate fighting championship called and invited me to the fight. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  And I was excited.  My whole entire family studies martial arts.  And so I've always...  Do you?  I...  Can you kick ass?  Yeah.  I do tie bow.  So I don't necessarily...  Tie bow.  So you can get in shape in front of the person that wants to kill you.  Yeah.  The thing is, my mom was a third-degree black belt, and I always wanted to study, but she  wouldn't let me.  Yeah.  She didn't want me to get hurt.  She would come home.  She used to break boards, so she would come home with, like, broken bones and bruises, 
[01:20:30]  and she wanted me to be a dancer, so I went to dance classes.  So I've always wanted to study, but I just never really did.  And then I started taking Billy's class, which, you know, I mean...  Keeps you in shape.  Keeps you in good shape.  That's for sure.  I'll give you that.  Right.  But it's exciting.  It's so raw.  I mean, you've seen it before.  Oh, yeah.  We had a demonstration last night.  We had Tito in here yesterday.  No, we did.  Tito Ortiz.  Bring in Steve.  Tito Ortiz took Steve down.  Come here, Steve.  He's 320 pounds.  It took him 11 seconds.  Former bouncer, and we figured we'd let Tito put a hold on Steve, and Steve would try to 
[01:21:00]  stay out of this hold as long as possible.  Yeah.  From the word go, Tito sized him up, took him down, put a choke hold on him, and Steve tapped  out in 11 seconds.  11 seconds.  It was over.  I mean, and I cannot wait to see this.  I will never take oxygen for granted again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's useful in life.  It really is.  And when it's being choked out of you by a guy that size.  Yeah.  I think it's okay.  I can't breathe through my mouth.  I'll just breathe through my nose.  Wait.  That's not there either.  Yeah.  Nothing. 
[01:21:30]  And who else do we have in here?  A champion?  Am I?  Yeah, you're correct.  You are the champion.  Yeah.  I'm Carlos Nune.  Well to weight.  Well champion.  And did you ever fight Tito?  Almost, but.  Almost.  Thank God I didn't.  Really?  Why?  He's a big guy.  He is a big guy.  He's pretty tough.  He's like heavyweight.  I'm well to weight.  Yeah.  Oh, different weight class.  Okay.  I'm pretty well to stay out of there.  But you're pretty good in your own right.  Oh yeah.  What's your record?  Damn good.  You got a damn good record? 
[01:22:00]  Damn good.  Damn good.  That's good enough for me.  Yeah.  At this point with a record of damn good.  Damn good.  That's all I need to hear.  Hey, Rick, why are you laughing so bad?  Well, because we're in the midst of our MILF contest.  Yeah.  Moms I'd like to ask them.  We've been taking pictures.  And well, one mom showed up with kids.  No, you can't bring your kids to the...  Oh my God.  Is it Paula Poundstone?  Is she the one that showed up?  No.  Because that would be inappropriate. 
[01:22:30]  Paula's a little tied up right now.  Oh, but she's a hot mom.  But you can't bring your children to this.  I don't know.  Oh.  Then we realize how wrong it is.  You know?  Yeah.  We don't want to know how wrong this is.  Yeah.  Let's ask Carmen.  Carmen, is it wrong?  Is it wrong?  Yeah.  Well, if they want to do it, you know, if they're into it.  I mean, if they bring the kids, yeah, that's wrong.  That's wrong.  Oh, there's strollers outside our studio.  Leave the kids at home, you know.  The lesbian couch doesn't have daycare.  You know, you've got to be able to...  Thank God Jim Norton's not here today.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:23:00]  That's all I'm going to say.  That's it.  It means something totally different when he tells the kids to play in the ball pit.  Right.  George, what's up?  All right, I'll give my...  Hey, Carmen, how are you doing?  I'm good.  How are you?  Oh, I'm doing great now that I'm talking to you.  Aw.  Did you see her spread in FHM Magazine?  Unfortunately, I haven't.  I work a lot.  It's on newsstands now.  You're on the cover, right?  Yes.  Hey, I got a question.  How can I get into this Ultimate Fighting Championship?  I'm big enough.  You think so?  Huh?  You got to take me out. 
[01:23:30]  Take you out.  You got to be good at techniques and stuff.  It's not just about getting in there and kicking ass.  You got to know how to tie people up.  You got to know how to kick and punch.  Well, it'd be very difficult for somebody to bring me off my feet.  I'm seven foot one.  Doesn't matter.  We saw it yesterday, man.  Don't matter how big you are.  Steve went down quick.  Yeah.  Well, I have a black belt as well.  You would last 15 seconds tops, George.  Tito said he's got a belt to hold his pants up.  That's about it.  He doesn't need a belt.  The guy was just huge.  He took down Steve in no time. 
[01:24:00]  Tito said he could take on Tyson and beat him in 40 seconds.  Yeah.  He said if Tyson was in the Ultimate Fighting Ring, because Tyson's a boxer.  He doesn't know all the other skills that go into being an Ultimate Fighter, that he  would take him in 40 seconds.  I would just love to see that.  I think Mike could bite him, though, or something.  Mike playing a little dirty.  That's a legal hold.  It's an illegal hold.  I think they actually revamped the show, or the fight, and now they have certain rules.  I think before there were no rules at all, but now they have a few rules.  I don't know.  I think you were allowed to bite before, actually. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Anything went.  I don't think you can bite anymore.  No biting.  But you could kick people in the face.  I've seen people's teeth go flying.  Yeah.  It's pretty raw.  Yeah.  I mean, those guys are real athletes, you know?  Yeah.  Not just throwing a couple of big guys in a ring, you know?  But the whole thing of seeing this, because I'm psyched.  I'm going to see this tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah.  Is just to watch huge guys beat the living crap out of each other.  And, you know, I'm in.  I am in.  I really, I've always enjoyed it over the years.  So I'm psyched for it.  And now, someone's going to get a chance to sit with you. 
[01:25:00]  Is this true?  Really?  She doesn't even know.  She doesn't know.  I like how I'm informed about this.  Yeah, we had some giveaway.  Look, look, the publicist, no, no.  All right, I'm just telling you what I heard.  If someone has screwed up here, it ain't me.  It's Motley Crue.  They did.  Now, what happened?  What's the details on this?  Do we have a contest or no?  You guys don't know anything about it?  All right, we haven't really.  Jesus H. Christ.  I knew it.  And the publicist right away. 
[01:25:30]  We should have a contest.  Very good.  You're good.  You're like a tigress.  They should have a contest.  They should.  Yeah.  Right?  The second you go over there, she's like, rip your throat out.  Go ahead.  What, Carmen?  They should have a contest.  That'd be fun.  Yeah.  I'd be into it.  Would you?  Yeah.  You want to sit with me?  Have you seen our listeners, Carmen?  Okay, maybe I take that back.  You can sit with me.  I'm watching it on pay-per-view at home.  You get the good share.  Hey, are you dating Dave Navarro?  Yes. 
[01:26:00]  Nice.  Dave.  Dave's a cool guy.  He's a really great guy.  And you just had sex in a sushi restaurant recently?  I was just reading that.  What was that about?  Well, you know, I just, as you said, I was on the cover, I'm on the cover this month of  FHM, and it's a men's magazine, and it's a little bit more risque, and they tend to  ask, I couldn't believe they use those shots.  They have a boobie shot of Carmen Electro.  They said they weren't going to use that?  No, but it's the British magazine. 
[01:26:30]  I mean, so I guess they can show a little bit more than they do here.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  The British one, they could show a frontal.  Yeah, they show, yeah, a little.  They can show a little.  Just a quick peek.  That's all.  No, the pictures are great.  Thanks.  You've been passing the magazine around a lot in the back office.  So what's the story with the sushi restaurant with Dave?  So when they were doing the interview for FHM, they liked to ask some pretty out there questions,  and they said, where's the, you know, strangest place you've had sex?  And I happened to go to dinner with Dave to a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles, and we went 
[01:27:00]  to go use the restroom, and when the door opened, he pulled me inside, and, you know, the rest  is history.  So, you know, told a little story in FHM, and now I'll hear about it for the rest of my  life.  Wow.  Wash hands before leaving.  Did you pay attention to the sign there in the bathroom?  No.  You've got to wash your hands after that.  No, we didn't.  We didn't wash your hands.  Were people just pounding on the door waiting for you guys?  No.  No one else really knew?  It didn't take that long.  No.  Uh-oh. 
[01:27:30]  That's not a very good thing to say.  You know what?  For either of us, it was, you know.  Dave's side of that.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It didn't take long for either of us.  Oh, okay.  It was meant to be a cookie.  We have so much sexual chemistry.  It's amazing.  Yeah?  There's nothing wrong with being quick, especially when you're with Carmen Electra.  In a sushi restaurant.  In a sushi restaurant.  Have you heard from Dennis Rodman?  No.  Everyone wants us to ask you that.  Nothing?  No, I actually, I moved and I changed my numbers.  Really?  What was going through your mind at that time in your life? 
[01:28:00]  I need to move and change my numbers.  How do you hook up with a Dennis Rodman and go, this is good for me?  I wish him the best.  Yeah?  Yeah, I do.  Absolutely.  I don't know.  I think he has a really good heart and I wish the best for him.  As you move and change your numbers.  As I move and change my numbers.  All right.  He has a really good heart.  As long as it stays at least 300 yards away from me at all times.  Right.  Any listeners want to ask her anything?  Or should we go to the moms?  Yeah, let me see what Mike has. 
[01:28:30]  Mike, what's going on?  Hello, how you doing?  All right.  I want to ask Carmen, first of all, I want to tell her how beautiful she is.  Thank you.  And second of all, I just wanted to know who's bigger, Rodman or Navarro?  Oh, come on.  Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.  All right, Mike.  She's not going to answer that.  No.  Let the publishers talk to him.  Yeah.  Why don't we take a break?  He's printing in the corner.  Are you going to hang for a little while?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:29:00]  A few more minutes?  Sure.  I'll take a quick break.  Come back.  Would you mind if we got the moms in here?  Ask the publicist.  Oh, no.  You.  We want to know what you want to do.  That's boring.  We talk about that.  We gave it a great push yesterday.  Yeah.  And today.  And we gave it another great push today.  Carlos, you're fighting tomorrow, right?  No.  No?  No.  You guys got to wait until October.  I'm fighting in Vegas.  Oh.  Vegas?  Okay.  All right.  There.  We pushed it. 
[01:29:30]  Sounds pretty much covered.  Where's the fight?  Oh, look at this.  We could be done, right?  Where's the fight at, actually?  It's at.  Meadowlands.  Wow.  I don't like you.  Eight o'clock?  Yeah.  Continental Airlines.  She's the publicist.  You're not supposed to like them.  You're ruining our buzz.  What do you want us to say about Ultimate Fight?  Tomorrow night, tomorrow night, tomorrow night.  Here, get on mic.  Right.  Hey.  It's most exciting.  It's official export.  He's wearing a suit.  He's wearing a suit.

Opie and Anthony hit the Jersey Shore July 7th for an all-day road show at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park.  Wow.  The party starts at 1 GM.

Yeah, that's cool.  At least you have a...  Awful.  Take your cell phone and leave.  Yeah, you.

[01:32:30]  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  The publicist, uh, yanked Carmen Electra out of here.  Oh.  Ah.  Ah.  Publicists.  Oof.  Shit.  What a twat.  These people like.  You know, we have a guest on the show.  We'd like them to just come in and sit down so they can hang and be part of this show.  We're not like a show that has, uh, guests that come on to be interviewed, uh, about things 
[01:33:00]  we really don't, we really don't care about.  We just like them coming in and becoming a part of the show, being involved with whatever's  going on at any given moment.  That's pretty much it.  We don't want to have to have a line of people, an entourage, standing there looking like a  firing squad and, and groaning at, at questions or a publicist that's making faces and, uh.  They were all lined up over here. 
[01:33:30]  They were all.  They were lined up against the wall with their arms folded looking at us like.  It was like Nuremberg.  They were like voting on us in a glass booth.  Oh.  It's like, why are we here?  Well, then leave.  We don't need you to have a good radio show.  Oh, the Rodman thing.  Oh, she makes a face.  Oh, oh, the sushi bar thing.  Oh, oh, you know, that's the only interesting stuff we want to hear about.  And they're the ones that gave you the information.  Yeah.  It's not like you found out.  It was in the, it was in the press release.  Oh.  And Carmen Electra, you know, I should say it.  She was very cool.  It was, it was, ugh.  Ugh. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  I'm so annoyed.  That, ugh.  Ugh.  Bitch.  Aren't we going to talk about the Ultimate Fighting Championship?  We spent how much time yesterday talking about it?  Of course, she doesn't have a clue because she doesn't know what this show's about or what  we talked about.  Yeah, that's what, that's what's going to make people riveted to their radios.  Because they're stuck in traffic.  Woo.  So, um, Ultimate Fighting.  That's right, Ben.  Yeah.  Yes, she does. 
[01:34:30]  Well, it had to be said.  It had to be said, man.  Sorry.  It can't be heard, but it had to be said.  Can we bring in the hot mom?  Yeah, let's get right back on track after that distraction.  Moms, I like to F.  The contest is going quite well.  Well, we have at least five moms out there.  Yeah.  We've been distracted between Brewer, who just killed for us, and the Carmen Electra publicist  train wreck.  Yeah.  We can get back to the moms.  One mom brought two very small kids down to prove that she's a mom.  Well, because you wouldn't believe it if you just saw her. 
[01:35:00]  She's, you know, wow.  A blonde beauty.  Yeah.  Where's my prizes?  We got the Myrtle Beach trip for the grand prize.  We have a Samsung.  Samsung.  Samsung DVD VHS player.  And other things to give away.  Yeah.  Oh, we'll dim the lights for you ladies.  Don't you worry about it.  That's Pam, right?  Yes.  With her see-through top.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, don't. 
[01:35:30]  Opie, you reamed it.  Wow, look at you.  Those are real?  Wow.  You have nicer boobs than Carmen Electra.  Oh.  Oh, my goodness.  You should be very excited now.  All right.  What is going on here?  These girls are really tipsy.  We have no problem with that.  I didn't drink anything.  No, huh?  Just a little.  You just had that crazy look in your eye.  Naturally.  Oh, be stopped.  She happens to like Carmen Electra.  On the HBO Bellevue special.  What?  What's that?  She happens to like Carmen Electra. 
[01:36:00]  Don't use the word crazy.  Okay.  So, who's getting with who today?  Pam's in the Moms I Like to Have contest.  Are Pam's pictures up?  How come Carmen Electra didn't say?  Yeah, right.  The publicist really would have allowed her to do that.  That's for sure.  Hey, all the new contestants in the Moms I Like to Have contest are up on WNEW.com.  Oh, they are right now?  I'm looking at Angela's pictures.  Very, very nice.  Very, very nice.  Pam?  Pam's pictures?  Let me see.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to have to go there before the... 
[01:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  Pam.  The site's getting pounded now.  Pam, you got some fine photos up on WNEW.com.  And Marianne.  Oh, yeah.  Very nice.  It's working.  This contest is...  We've got a contest to be very nice.  All right.  So, who wants to do the lesbian couch thing?  Me.  Adam, you're not allowed.  Come on.  Pam, you're in?  Yeah.  Marianne?  Pam's in.  I think it's an all or nothing. 
[01:37:00]  What do we...  I don't know.  What?  What?  What?  Nothing.  Let it out.  You're blocking.  Let it out.  Yeah.  Angela, speak your mind.  What?  Oh, I'm the publicist.  You're dressed.  I know attention.  That's Adam Ferrara.  I can't spit it out.  Why are you dressed?  The mom has, like...  Yeah.  Wait, you've got to talk it to a mic.  There are children out there.  Oh, you don't want to do it because the children are around?  There are children out there.  Yeah, they can't see in here, though.  No, that's why I'm dressed.  They're asking why I'm dressed.  Thanks, because there's two little babies out there.  Yeah, well... 
[01:37:30]  Uh-oh.  All right.  Buzz kill.  As long as there's not a publicist around, we'll be fine.  No.  And we've already located the whipped cream.  Yeah, we have whipped cream.  Oh.  All right, who wants in on this?  Seriously.  Yeah, which ladies want to...  Let me go around the room.  Angela, are you game?  All right.  Okay.  That's one.  That's one.  Marianne?  Yes, you're in?  You're in.  I'm all going.  Okay.  Cool.  Cool.  And Pam?  Pam?  Are you videotaping? 
[01:38:00]  Every time I get out, they pull me back in.  Yeah.  Pam?  Pam?  Like I said, it's a thing that, you know, whatever you girls want to do, that's fine.  Just hit the couch and take it at your own.  It's freestyle.  There's no moves you have to perform.  Right.  Does it give us some points to the contest?  Yeah, really.  Anthony, say, you know something?  Say, yes.  Our listeners do the voting, but this absolutely will give you a boost in the voting.  I'm certain of it.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  Hell yeah.  Let's go to Tommy, who just saw Pam's pictures up online.  Tommy.  Dude.  You're getting dumped out of that.  Sicko.  All right, Tommy.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Pam, are you into the, uh, what he said?  No comment.  Oh.  Wow.  How did Tommy know then?  No comment always means yes.  Yeah.  That is the stupidest thing when you go no comment to a question. 
[01:39:00]  You ever done that before?  Huh?  Guy might like, uh, that whole golden shower thing.  That's why he's my ex-husband.  Oh.  That was your ex-husband?  That was your ex-husband?  No, not him.  Oh, I was going to say.  Wow.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Okay.  Oh, because he was into it and you weren't quite into it.  Actually, no.  That's a whole other story, but it's an O&A story.  Start talking.  Yeah, Pam, let's talk.  It's an O&A story.  It's an O&A story.  They already know it. 
[01:39:30]  He put wow stickers up on the back of the car.  I didn't approve.  However, when I started flashing them on Wednesdays, he didn't approve.  Oh, boy.  So he has a gal.  So he got rid of your husband?  Absolutely.  Second husband.  Second husband got rid of him because of wow?  Not the father of my children.  And wow broke up a marriage?  So you figured you'd get back at him by wowing.  Yeah.  He puts wow stickers up on the car. 
[01:40:00]  He makes women a wow.  Can I ask Pam a serious question?  Why aren't you wowing the inventors of wow?  Yeah.  If you're wowing everyone else.  You should climb the mountain, young lady.  Right.  Because I still do have my principles.  We invented wow.  There's no cameras.  But I have two other lovely ladies here.  I don't know.  That are looking to be wowed.  I'll play what's in my pants.  But I won't wow. 
[01:40:30]  Well, let's get this going, right?  Sure.  Then we'll just hit the couch.  Oh, look.  The lights are dimming.  Thank God.  I thought I had a tumor.  We're dimming the lights.  We're dimming the lights.  It's...  We got mood music?  It's the lesbian mom couch.  Yeah.  Huh?  Music?  Do we have the boom box or something?  A little mood music?  We like the mood music.  Where's the boom box?  We should...  That's on its way up.  Any kind of music in particular the girls into?  Doesn't matter. 
[01:41:00]  Nine Inch Nails.  You pick.  Nine Inch Nails.  Mom's into Nine Inch Nails.  I want to be like an animal.  Nice.  I want to be from the inside.  Are we getting dropped now?  We could do that.  We could do the Nine Inch Nails.  No problem with that.  And then...  I did the whipped cream.  You did.  Okay.  Well, a little whipped cream.  You could have fun with that on the couch.  I could have the hair on it.  Oh.  Nasty. 
[01:41:30]  All right.  There we are.  Use the other can.  Yeah, we will.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't you ladies make your way to the lesbian couch over there?  Yeah.  We'll have Stinky over there with a little remote mic.  And then, well, I guess whatever transpires.  You know what it is, though?  There's a very difficult timeline here.  It's called the window of opportunity.  Yeah, you got a cash in.  We were really there, right in it, the window of opportunity.  And then all of a sudden, with the Carmen Electra thing, it cooled down, I think. 
[01:42:00]  I think they started talking and feeling a little weird about this.  We should have struck while the iron was hot.  I think we would have gotten a better response, but I'm hoping we can bring it back.  I think you regain momentum.  That's what I mean.  I think we're at a critical mass.  We've got to bring it back.  Bring it back around.  I think we need to turn the lights down a lot lower.  Turn those lights way down.  Yeah.  It's radio.  It's okay.  We don't need to.  Yeah, I think that mic's not working.  I should have told you that about ten minutes ago.  Great. 
[01:42:30]  There you go.  All right.  They are all three on the couch right now.  Oh, Pam.  Been here seven years.  Man.  Fair case doesn't work.  Seven years.  Nothing works here.  There are seven yards.  So these ladies just met Anthony.  Yep.  Three fine moms that are in our Moms I'd Like to F contest.  Their pictures are all up on www.com.  The dress is coming on.  One mom just took off her dress.  Now they're all in their bra and panties.  That's good. 
[01:43:00]  One has the whipped cream.  Someone's got to make the first move.  With the whipped cream, you mean?  Yeah.  Whipped cream makes everything better.  There you go.  Pam is...  It's like Catalyst.  All right.  Pam spraying whipped cream on the two girls.  She's being sprayed in on herself.  Look, just like mom used to make.  There is whipped cream all over all three of the girls' boobs right now.  All over their chests. 
[01:43:30]  And now...  Oh, here.  Oh, there we go.  Angela's going for a taste.  Oh, Angela is...  Yeah.  Getting the whipped cream off of Pam.  We have contact.

Now Pam getting in on the whipped cream on Angela's leg.  As the other two make out ferociously. 
[01:44:30]  Wow.  They are really, really going at it.  Oh, now they're just wiping whipped cream all over the place.  Oh, now Angela grabbing Pam.  Wait, no.  Yeah.  Now they're making out and, oh my God, what's going on there?  Marianne going for a taste.  I think we can say that.  She's never done this.  She's never done this.  Your wife's never done this before?  Never, ever.  And it's with two strange girls.  They are really having fun on the couch, Anthony.  They're covered with whipped cream now and, oh my God.  Lose the tops. 
[01:45:00]  Lose the tops.  Lose the tops.  Lose the...  Very good, O.B.  I thought I'd try.  They're going at their own speed.  A lot of touching.  They're people feeling each other all over the place.  They're enjoying every minute.  They're not rushing at all.  These are three moms, Anthony.  Isn't it?  Three moms.  Isn't it cool to see Angela doing it?  Wow.  Now there's some...  Oh, yeah.  I think we could say there's some squeezing going on. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, a little over the bra touching going on.  Now a little neck licking.  Pam is watching Angela and Marianne.  There you go.  Angela and Marianne.  Completely go at it.  Going at it.  Now the hands are going.  There we go.  Now the hands are...  Wow.  Wow.  Angela just using Pam's upper half as she makes out with Marianne.  That's just greedy.  That was a really good move, Angela.  Wow, that is pretty nice, man.

[01:46:30]  All right.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Now there's some more touching going on there, Alphie.  Her husband watching on.  Yeah, her husband's watching Marianne just completely attack Angela.  Now Angela's saying sorry.  No, he's completely...  I know what he's thinking.  He's totally loving this right now.  He's so into that right now.  I don't even have to ask him.  I know he's enjoying it.  This is the best moment of my entire life.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's 35 years of misery and then this. 
[01:47:00]  You get this.  Angela, really give it to Marianne.  Oh, really give it to her.  No, give her one more good one.  Go ahead.  You know you want to.  You're all wet and there's no water in there.  Yeah, those...  How can I work the tops things?  You've got to work a pimp hand.  Get the tops on.  Whoa.  Okay, now they're on top.  Oh, wow.  They're a little bit...  Oh, there's...  Uh-oh.  Yeah, okay.  There's a little more touching going on than there was just before.  I'll tell you that.

A lot of people are saying we should shut the F up so they can listen in a little bit. 
[01:49:30]  So, ladies, we're going to be quiet for a minute, so you can do whatever you want.  Go ahead.  I'm going to miss my little league game.  Can we hear you?  You're going to miss your little league game.  Yeah, the one mom has to go to a little league game.  How disturbing is this?  I forgot to mention that.  Poor kid's going to be there with his little cardinal's uniform and his little mitt wondering where mommy is.  That's awful. 
[01:50:00]  I always wonder why my mom didn't go to my little league games.  I think I just got the answer.  Conjures up an image.  His little hat that doesn't fit quite right.  Where's mommy?

She looks like she's doing a very good job of it.  Opie and Anthony, where your lesbian dreams come true.  Angela had whipped cream spread all over her body.  It's almost all gone.  Mm-hmm.  Ooh, look.  There's just a glaze of joy.  Look what's going on now.  Okay.  All right.  Now we're getting some real serious action.

For those of you listening, if you think you think what's happening...  It's happening.  It's happening.  Yeah, because we can't really describe too much or we're going to get screwed.  You could really use your imagination here.  I can tell you this much.  We've got three moms that have yes kids.  They're in our Moms I'd Like to F contest, and they're just completely going at it on 
[01:56:30]  a couch right now.  Just completely.  Everything you could think of and imagine is happening.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's no holds barred here.  Yay!  Angela.  Wow.

Yeah, Stinky, just keep that mic closed so we can hear any reaction.  There's a lot of sick crap going on.  We've got a husband watching, Pam, who's not in the action right now.  She likes to watch, though.  She loves to watch, and she's just getting really into watching these two go out.  Pam, why don't you describe what's going on?  Angela, is she...  Yeah, describe what's...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:57:30]  Don't describe it.  We will describe it.  Yeah.  I like it better with her voice.  Yeah, but, Adam, believe me.  All right.  This is barely on the radio right now.  No, we have to be as vague as possible.  We are trained professionals.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  No talking.  All right.  Let's just...  Angela.  Yeah, we know it.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just got to tell you, I've been listening for about three, four months.  My mother got me turned on to you guys.

I think we have a love connection.  I think Angela and...  Oh, look at that move.  Oh.  Marianne just totally wrapped... 
[01:58:30]  I do, but these guys don't.  ...wrapped around her.  She's got her in some kind of an ultimate fighting hold.  It's a figure four leg lock.  They want us to mention ultimate fighting.  That's an ultimate fighting hold.  Yeah, that's a submissive hold.  That's a submission hold right there.  Submission hold.  I said submissive hold.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I'm the watcher.  I'm the watcher.  Happy Mother's Day.  Happy Mother's Day.  Wow.  Angela just can't get enough of Pam's upper half.  Oh, my boo-boo is going to be so mad. 
[01:59:00]  And now...  And now...  Oh, Marianne is...  Making believe she's a man right now.  A train.  Yeah.  There is truly a train on the couch right now.  We have two facing one way and one facing the other way.  Oh, smoke.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  I didn't see this on the Bellevue special.  No.  And look at that.  The couch is an absolute mess.  Oh, baby.  Turn this music off and put on Daddy's Home.

This is better than frigging horny goat weed.  It's working on me.  Oh, my God.  She's pulling her hair back.  You know what that means.  The girl pulls the hair back.  Okay.  If you want to know which moms were going at it today, go to www.com.  And that would be Pam, Marianne, and Angela.  Angela's got both of them by the hair. 
[02:00:00]  She's kind of in the middle.  Mm-hmm.  Angela has a little freak in her.  Freak.  Freak.  Freak.  That's something.  There is such...  Oh, wow.  Look at this.  It's like watching a...  We're not...  Shh.  It's art.  It is art.  It is art, Adam.  But...  Shh.  Let's see what they have to say.  Did one of them just say, Adam Ferrara tonight?  And the Carolines?  I think I heard one of them say that. 
[02:00:30]  Listen to that.  This lesbian act sponsored by Sam Adams.  Yeah.  Thank God.  We've got to tell Jim Cook about this.  And for the little kid playing Little League, keep your head down and follow through.  Mommy will be there in a minute.  Concentrate.  Where is Sam?  More Sam.  Mommy promised you would be here.  Sam Adams is an award-winning beer.  It's got more lesbians on a couch than any other beer. 
[02:01:00]  Don't stop.  Keep on doing what you're doing.  All right.  Get that mic in there and let's really listen.  By the way, these moms met today, which makes that part of it pretty hot, too.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Look at what she's doing.  There's, um, she's got horseback riding experience.  Go to Myrtle Beach.  There.  There.  It's the resort, damn it. 
[02:01:30]  It's riding.  It's riding.  Yeah.  They're riding.  Yeah.  They're coming around a clubhouse turn right now.  I think all three of us should go together.  And just to paint the perfect picture here, I look out the studio door.  There's two little kids under the age of two playing with a little ball down the hall.  Oh, boy.  They can't see what's going on.  Everybody's happy.  They can't see what's going on in here, but.  All right.  Let's hear it for the moms.  One of the hottest lesbian couch segments we've ever had on this show.  Ever.  And we've done teen lesbian couch before. 
[02:02:00]  You girls have given the teen lesbian couch girls a run for their money.  I'll tell you that much right there.  As they start cleaning up the whipped cream.  What.  What a day for moms.  Hey.  June 28th.  Mark your calendars.  It's Mother's Day.  It's really Mother's Day today.  Very nice ladies.  Let's hear it for Pam, Marianne, and Angela.  Yeah.  And we have to take a break, Anthony.  Yes, we do.  Yeah.  We'll be back. 
[02:02:30]  Toll free.  877-692-1027.  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys may be bloke.  Oh, great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and A, my two favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What a couple of ass wipes.  The husband is sweating like a pig right now.  Yeah, baby.  Anthony.  Do I make you horny?  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Need I say a goddamn word about Sam Adams? 
[02:03:00]  Sam Adams.  It's like the liquid roofies.  Let me help everyone out.  Yeah.  Next time you have a Sam Adams, what are you going to think about?  Right.  You're going to be in a bar and you're going to like just, you know, casually order a Sam Adams  and something is going to pop in your hand.  Can I buy you Sam Adams?  And can I get one for your mother?  Right.  I'm looking at the Sam Adams label right now off of the Sam I'm Drinking.  Patriot Brewer.  It says right on the label. 
[02:03:30]  Sam Adams.  Brewer Patriot.  It should add an accelerant for lesbian mom sex.  Mm-hmm.  Because this whole thing made possible by Sam Adams.  Go out and get one.  My God.  Get one for your girl.  Or both of them.  Or three of them.  Sam Adams.  Opie and Anthony.  W-N-E-W.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:04:00]  Wow.  Woo!  And what a show it is.  Adam Farrar in the studio.  He's playing Caroline here in New York all this weekend.  Starting tonight, right, Adam?  Starting tonight.  After I go home and take a shower.  Yeah.  Adam got the whipped cream can autograph.  Autographed whipped cream can.  It's a collector's item.  It certainly is.  Lesbian mom.  Yeah.  Wow.  We have another four moms outside for the Moms I'd Like to Have Contest.  See?  Hey, we told you.  And other moms, if you want to come down and you think you could beat the moms that are 
[02:04:30]  up on www.com right now, come on down tomorrow.  Bart, what's going on?  Hey, not much, man.  That was the best radio I've ever heard in my life, man.  You guys beat that long curly hair, black hair guy by far, man.  Well, that was some hot...  Thank you, Bart.  All right, man.  Hey, thanks, bud.  Radio.  Let's go to Paul, 14 years old.  Paul.  You guys are the best.  I look like a glazed donut right now.  Oh, God.  That's like the best for a 14-year-old. 
[02:05:00]  And you want to know something?  You're never going to grow out of it.  Right.  It starts a whole career of loving smut.  Paul, let me teach you something.  That never gets old, okay?  Whether you're 14 or in your 30s, that never gets old.  There's death, taxes, and vats.  Right.  All right, later, guys.  You're not Paula Poundstone's kid, are you?  No.  Okay, just wondering.  By the way, we were talking about Black Earl and his shorts.  The picture's up on www.com.  Oh, yeah, and I'm sure that's the picture everyone's running to right now.  Earl and his shorts.  Forget about what we just saw. 
[02:05:30]  What's it?  Oh, screw Earl and his damn shorts, man.  Yeah.  I wish I was a flying out wall in that room when that was going on.  It was amazing.  It sounded amazing.  He couldn't say nothing.  We have seen so many cool things in this studio.  That was one of the hottest things I've ever seen in my life,  because there were so many sick, twisted things going on.  I mean, you had the husband looking on, and he was just losing his effing mind.  He was standing there.  He was, like, turned on, but he was jealous of the same.  It was wild.  With his jaw dropping, just watching the whole thing.  Amazing.  And then you had Pam, who really likes to just watch. 
[02:06:00]  I mean, she was in the action as well.  Oh, she was getting involved.  She was getting involved, but then getting really into it when she was just watching Angela and Mary Ann go at it.  Yeah, she was like the real mother.  Now Cher.  Cher.  Dave, what's going on?  I don't know.  I mean, you know, you get on the air and you do these things with these people, and you don't give us enough details.  Where are the details?  I need the details.  No, you don't, Dave.  You know something?  That's what your brain is there for.  Whatever you're imagining was happening was happening. 
[02:06:30]  Everything.  Imagining.  Imagining.  Everything that could possibly happen between three women were happening right there.  And you want to know what the amazing thing was?  They were quiet.  Yeah.  It was the first time women are quiet.  There was some of the, I heard the heavy breathing going on.  Well, their mouths were full.  And the lips smacked up.  They were full of whipped cream.  Dave, it was nice.  Yeah.  You can figure it out, okay?  Oh, yeah.  I can figure it out.  Everything you could think that women could do, whatever. 
[02:07:00]  I really liked it when you described those other girls, those teen girls.  Oh, that was so good.  All right.  Thanks, Dave.  Yeah.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, that was damn hot.  But those moms are even better than teens.  Yeah.  The dads clean up after themselves.  Yeah, that was really hot.  They clean up after themselves.  We're going to attempt teen catfighting this coming Tuesday.  Dave, so we'll see if we can beat what we just saw.  You know what was really hot about the moms doing this?  Now, we've had the teen girls come in and do the teen lesbian couch.  But you always assume that the teen girls are like the wild ones. 
[02:07:30]  You know, they're young and they're on the couch with each other.  They're going wild.  When it's the moms doing that, you realize, oh, my God, they didn't lose one bit of their sexuality.  And they know what they want, too.  And wanting to be hot and kinky and stuff.  And just them doing that, it made it that much hotter.  Moms want...  Moms want muff, too, Anthony.  They want it.  Yes, they do.  I don't know.  It was like an episode of Donna Reed I once saw. 
[02:08:00]  I did a benefit for that organization.  Moms that want muff?  Yeah, moms that want muff.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Honestly, I know you guys get pretty famous and all, but how do you contain yourselves with  that going on?  I know you see a lot of, but how do you contain yourselves about to slip out your junk and  start being a suspect?  Well, for me, unfortunately, I was getting a glimpse of the two kids running down the  hall with a little ball. 
[02:08:30]  That kind of brought me back to reality.  Well, the way you deal with it is you just, you watch, you download, whatever happens,  yeah, you kind of do it, and then you blow the top of your girlfriend's head off when  you get home.  All right, guys.  Eric, we sacrifice for our listeners.  That's what we do.  We're like Jesus Christ.  We sacrifice.  We sacrifice for your sins.  That's right.  We have to control ourselves so we can bring you the images that are happening in the studio. 
[02:09:00]  Holy Jesus.  Speaking of images.  Hello.  There's no way in the...  You're the mom of those two kids that are running around outside the studio?  Wow.  And how old are your kids?  Three and 15 months.  Fifteen months ago, you had a kid?  Yes.  And look at your belly.  Wow.  There's no sign of a child once residing in that promised land.  Thank you.  Thank you, Adam.  Beautiful, beautiful blonde with a pink bikini. 
[02:09:30]  That promised land.  But Jerusalem's gorgeous.  Well, I've got to be honest, because some moms, or the ones you really think of, the  stereotypical moms, like you're wearing a little belly ring.  When most moms wear a belly ring, it looks like the handle on a bowling bag.  Yeah.  You know?  But that right there is...  That's nice and sexy and a flat stomach.  Yeah.  Sometimes it looks like a pull tab on a raft.  Right.  Hey, can you breastfeed one of your kids in front of us?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  You know, I...  What?  You always got to go just too far. 
[02:10:00]  No, the kid looked hungry.  That's all.  That's all I was getting at.  I did breastfeed, and that's why I still look like this.  I was concerned for the kid.  Anthony had nothing to do with my sick, twisted mind.  Oh, sure.  You didn't breastfeed?  No.  No?  What, did you put them on the formula?  Because I heard all these horror stories that, you know, your boobs just fall down to your waist.  Well, yours haven't done that.  I didn't want to do that.  You breastfeed, they look like your golf ball and pantyhose.  Right.  So...  Not for me.  Adam Ferrara, Caroline's.  Always along. 
[02:10:30]  These jokes and many others.  Wow.  You're beautiful.  What is your name?  Yeah, what is your name?  Jeannie?  Hello, Jeannie.  Jeannie.  Jeannie.  Jeannie.  Jeannie.  Did we take her pictures yet?  We're about to take them now.  Oh, man, you guys.  Just when you thought it couldn't get any better.  Very skimpy little pink bikini she's wearing.  And I've got to tell you, it must be a little cooler in the studio today than it was yesterday.  I see that because that's a very sheer bathing suit.  I can only imagine when it's wet.  I wouldn't know.  It's never gotten wet.  Really?  Oh, you just wear that one around the pool?  This is bedroom purposes only. 
[02:11:00]  Bedroom purposes only.  It's got the little bows on the side, easy access.  Well, you've got a little tat right there.  What is that?  It says, clean your room.  This is an orchid.  An orchid.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, and a little...  I didn't know it was a teaback.  Look at that.  You know what's great?  The orchid is very symbolic of a woman's anatomy.  Right.  And then you have the back.  It's a moon.  Yes.  Which is symbolic for the ass.  Look at you.  Did you think that out?  I sure did.  Very good job.  Guys, we've got to get her out there. 
[02:11:30]  The kids are crying.  Oh, God.  Come on.  They're upset.  They want to see their mom.  You couldn't find a sitter?  All right.  Or a publicist?  All right.  You know, I'm starting to get upset with our show.  This is just wrong.  What's the matter, Rick?  What did you just say, Rick?  Why, Rick?  She comes walking out, and they see her, and they both go like...  The hands both go up and go, Mommy!  Oh, no.  That's the same thing Stinky did when she first got into the bathing suit.  This is legal, isn't it? 
[02:12:00]  I don't know, Rick.  Why didn't my mom have a pink bikini when I was growing up?  Tim, what's up?  She did.  Hey, how are you guys doing tonight?  All right, Tim.  Hey, absolutely fantastic segment.  Kind of curious why you can't get into a little bit more detail on what's actually going on,  like, you know, describing going down to the netherworld, going down to the nether reaches,  what they're doing and so forth.  Well, I think we were describing good enough that you knew what was going on.  I'll tell you why, because Ann and I are radio geniuses. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, is that it?  Oh, yeah.  I thought we were effing idiots.  We could get stuff like that on the radio, because if you're listening in, it could be  a bunch of ladies just playing Twister.  Canasta.  Canasta.  Yes, never know.  Yeah, but you know something?  I knock with a four.  You knew what was going on.  Yeah, you could hear.  We should turn the music down a little bit.  I'd love to hear the sound effects a little bit better, but it was absolutely fantastic.  All right, we'll take that into consideration for the next one.  All right, Tim, thank you.  I appreciate it.  How much can you get away with saying? 
[02:13:00]  Not much, Adam.  Not much.  Not much.  You've got to realize, certain things in one word are fine, but if you stretch it out and  start putting the pieces together, then it's a problem.  So we like keeping it a little vague, but believe me, we put out enough information.  You're familiar with the show and code words.  You know what's going on.  And then you use your brain.  Use that brain of yours.  That's right.  Everyone's blood was out of their brain, so they had a hard time.  They're like, bye, bye, bye. 
[02:13:30]  Tommy.  Guys.  Yeah.  Man, oh, man, I share this, man.  I got two girls, 14 and 16, and I swear, I can't wait for the next bake sale or PPA meeting  at school, because I am going to be checking every one of them mothers out.  You know, a lot of people say when we do the teen weeks and stuff here, it's like, I don't  remember girls like that when I was in school.  Well, I don't remember moms being like that either.  There's something in the water.  A few of the moms have teenagers.  Yeah.  Teen, teen kids. 
[02:14:00]  My mom was like Mrs. Roper.  Yeah.  Her friends were like Mrs. Roper.  Walking around in the moo-moo in the house.  In the moo-moo, nothing going on with the beanbag, ashtray.  Never really hot.  Nothing.  Okay.  Wow.  Yeah, that was great.  Phew.  Earl's, we don't need to talk to Earl.  He just got to the sticker stop, Opie.  Remember how long ago he left?  Earl was supposed to be at a wow sticker stop an hour and a half ago. 
[02:14:30]  Earl.  Yeah, guys, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Why are you late, Earl?  You were supposed to be there at 4.30.  Yeah, we got here about 10 after 5.  We listened to the lesbian segment, and now we're calling in.  Earl, you got there at about 5.40.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Yes.  So when are you leaving? 
[02:15:00]  I'm going to leave at about 6.30.  Okay.  Earl, pace yourself.  We got a great crowd here.  This is completely raising hell.  Thank you, Opie.  I don't know how much more of that I could have taken.  Earl, please call back.  Something's wrong with your phone.  Hey, we got to play the DMX parody.  Everyone's asking for it.  Oh, yeah.  It would be a good way to regroup the radio show for the last hour.  This was a big hit when it debuted yesterday.  It's My Brother Joe. 
[02:15:30]  It's a huge hit.  We got to play a piece of the DMX song just to get everyone on board.  Parody writer extraordinaire.  And he steered away from doing another parody to the Patty Duke theme.  And he did a James Taylor version of DMX.  Of this song.  Yeah, we all know this, right?  This is going through my head when the girl's on the couch. 
[02:16:00]  Y'all gonna make me lose my cool up in here, up in here.  If I gots to bring it to you, cowards, then it's going to be quick.  When you're made up in the jail before, suck my dick.  You know, little boy, had to run.  Get down.  Get down quick.  You're going to poke your dog with some bumps.  I'm tickling it.  Now I'm one, one.  What?  All over some gum.  Ain't that summer?  What?  You know what's amazing?  What?  How did Brother Joe know what the lyrics were? 
[02:16:30]  Well, you know, singing it as James Taylor would sing it, you've got to know every word  and articulate it.  And I think he did a good job.  It's Joe, my brother Joe, doing James Taylor, doing that very song you just heard.  It's Joe, my brother Joe, doing that very song you just heard. 
[02:17:00]  Up in here, up in here.  If I gots to bring it to you, cowards, then it's going to be quick.  All right.  All you men's up in the jail before, suck my dick. 
[02:17:30]  And all them other cats you run with, get done with them quick.  How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some dumb shit?  All right.  There go the gun click.  Nine-one-one, sh**.  All over some dumb sh**.  Ain't that some sh**?  Your niggas remind me of a strip club. 
[02:18:00]  Cause every time you come around, it's like, what?  I just gotta get my niggas tucked.  And I don't know who the f**k you think you're talking to, but I'm dying.  I ain't slim.  So watch what you do while you go.  Find yourself buried next to someone else.  And we all thought you loved yourself. 
[02:18:30]  But that couldn't have been the issue.  Oh, maybe they just saying that.  Now, cause they miss you, sh**.  A niggas tried to diss you.  That's why you're laying on your back.  Looking at the roof of the church.  Preacher telling the truth.  And you know that it hurts.  Yeah.  Oh, y'all gon' make me lose my mind up in here, up in here. 
[02:19:00]  Y'all gon' make me go all out up in here, up in here.  Y'all gon' make me act cool up in here, up in here.  Y'all gon' make me lose my mind up in here, up in here.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, up in here.  How funny is that, huh?  I love that version. 
[02:19:30]  That is the best.  I slim.  I slim.  It's James Taylor.  He sounds like him.  Oh, that's funny.  We have to take a break and regroup.  I think that song is on foundrymusic.com.  The unedited version.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music dot com.  Opie and Anthony.  It's a road show.  Shut up.  Opie and Anthony hit the Jersey Shore July 7th for an all-day road show at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park.  Wow. 
[02:20:00]  The party starts at 1 p.m.  Anthony Bud Light.  Yeah, sometimes you want a light beer.  You know, sometimes you're drinking beer.  You want a light beer, though.  And you want one that tastes like beer, not some watered-down version of beer.  Bud Light.  When I want a light beer, I drink Bud Light because it tastes like Bud.  A lot of times, you know, you get a party in the cooler there.  It's full of Bud and Bud Light.  And then you pull out a Bud Light and you're drinking it and you realize, oh, my God, I've been drinking a Bud Light.  You know why?  Because it tastes like Bud. 
[02:20:30]  That's right.  Bud Light.  Wherever you're going this summer, make it a Bud Light.  You're going to the beach, ballpark, whatever.  Bud Light.  Look for their new bottle with a clear plastic label, very identifiable.  Bud Light.  We drink it when we want light beer.  You should, too.  Don't be fooled by imitations.  You only want the best, don't you?  So for the real taste that won't fill you up, never lets you down, make it a Bud Light like we do.  Mmm. 
[02:21:00]  Mmm.  Crispy, cold.  Four seconds.  Bud Light.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, by Opie and Anthony, serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  Now.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  In the studio.  Adam Farrar.  Hello.  Playing Carolines all weekend long here in New York.  Billy, it's not too far away.  Come on up and see Adam Farrar.  Very funny guy. 
[02:21:30]  And a childhood friend of Anthony.  My pal.  Hi, Anthony.  Three, two, one.  My pal.  My pal.  Somebody sent an instant feedback.  Said, uh, countdown to Anthony saying, my pal.  Five, four, three.  Here's my pal.  Here's my pal.  And Adam Farrar is on the job.  And Joe Buck's my pal.  The job.  That's right.  You're gonna let me lose my mind.  I like that song.  How funny is that? 
[02:22:00]  That song is great.  Up in here.  Let's go to Bill.  Bill, what's going on?  Not much.  We just got you down here in Philly.  I'm at work.  And if that last radio segment didn't make you number one, I don't know what will.  We're going to give it time.  But hopefully we can accomplish that down there.  Well, keep up the good work.  Thanks, Bill.  No problem.  All right, man.  Philly's the silly of motherly love.  Right.  Yes.  Motherly love.  Jim.  Hey.  Yep.  What's up, Jim?  You're on the radio.  Hey, you guys are really going to go to hell this time. 
[02:22:30]  Why?  You are truly the antichrist of radio.  Why?  What happened?  When I go home tonight, I'm going to hug my kids and beat my wife.  What would happen?  I'm just saying.  This stuff with the mothers coming in, I'm telling you.  It's amazing.  This is the opposite of arousal.  I don't think the Boston Medical Group can even help me at this time.  Oh, come on.  That wasn't hot?  That was really hot.  It was hot until I heard those kids about the kids screaming in the hall and letting their mother  and stuff.  Okay, listen.  Let me clear something up here, okay?  There are a couple little kids. 
[02:23:00]  They didn't see anything.  No.  We're not that twisted.  No.  It's all the visual here.  It's like I'm never going to look at motherhood the same way again.  I think I'm going to take it off my calendar.  Mother's Day.  Jim, you want a visual in your head?  Yeah.  And this is the God's honest truth.  There is a little kid somewhere in the outfield wondering where his mom is.  The kid can't be more than eight years old.  He's got the Cardinals uniform on because he's playing Little League right now.  Right.  The hat doesn't fit on quite right, and he's looking to the sidelines wondering where mom is. 
[02:23:30]  Know why mom is late?  Mom just had a three-way lesbian experience on a couch completely naked in our studio.  Not only that, they're going to be even later because the husband, who was watching the whole mess, is so worked up now.  So worked up, he said he will be having sex with his wife on the way to the Little League game in the car.  Well, now that you put it that way, I'm all better now, I guess.  Mommy, you smell like whipped cream. 
[02:24:00]  You guys are awesome.  All right, Jim.  Later.  That is the God's honest truth.  You missed it.  I caught the ball, and you weren't there.  Where were you, Mommy?  Mommy?  What a matter of fact, here's the Mommy that we just described on the phone.  Marianne.  Hi.  How are you doing, guys?  Have you guys had sex yet?  Not yet, because we're still on the West Side Highway, so we can't do that yet.  Don't let that stop you.  Well, I have had sex with my husband on many different occasions in many different locations, like our big thing. 
[02:24:30]  Go to a sushi bar and ask for the Carmen Electra Suites.  Yeah.  Is he steering without his hands right now?  Oh, he's trying to.  When does your son's Little League game start?  It starts at 8 o'clock, so we should be home just in time.  All right, a lot of people will feel much better knowing that you did not miss your son's Little League game.  No, we won't miss it.  But I just wanted to thank you guys, because I had an awesome time today.  It sure looked it.  Marianne, take this with you. 
[02:25:00]  One of the hottest things we've done on our radio.  Yeah, very hot.  It was very, very, very fun.  And actually, Tam, like, met us in the parking lot and gave us her phone number.  Is she going to the game, too?  Oh, I knew phone numbers would be exchanged.  Yeah, phone numbers were definitely exchanged, and it's something that we're looking forward to in the future.  Actually, Angela was an awesome kisser.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I enjoyed that very much. 
[02:25:30]  Very, very, very, very much.  She's crazy.  No, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  You know what?  I'm crazy, too.  So I just haven't been on a Bellevue special.  That kissing was very hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really was.  I'm glad you saw that.  And the whipped cream all over the place.  Nice.  Very nice.  Yeah, my hair is still sticky from it all.  Yeah, it's going to be stickier later when your husband gets through it.  Yeah, you're right about that.  Wow.  Did that make the radio? 
[02:26:00]  I would think so.  It's just a turn.  Well, what's wrong with butt desk?  Nothing.  Nothing.  But thanks.  I have to tell you a couple things, boys.  I have to tell you a couple things, because I know I always...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  They're dumping out of that nowadays?  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  Oh, come on.  Well, I have to tell you guys about a couple things.  Wait.  Hold on, hold on, Marianne.  Because that needs to get through.  Because of what you just went through, you will be having some backdoor action tonight. 
[02:26:30]  Definitely.  That's all I'm going to say.  All right.  I will definitely be having some backdoor action.  Maybe then.  Having lost my virginity last week.  Okay, okay, all right.  Slow down or they're going to dump out.  You know what we're going to have to do?  Opie, they have us so distracted with meetings about syndication that now they're pushing this stuff.  Because normally, if we got dumped out on things we normally do, we would be going, meeting, meeting, get in the office, let's talk about this and work this out.  They have us so distracted that now they're trying this angle. 
[02:27:00]  We have to call a meeting now and take care of this, because they're really effing with us now.  You're allowed to say what Marianne said as long as she didn't describe it.  Send out the butt sex memo meeting.  I have to tell you that I thought Rick was like the biggest cutie pie on the face of the planet.  So cute.  You're not in his...  I don't think he likes girls with vaginas.  Oh, that's okay.  I don't care.  I'm kidding. 
[02:27:30]  Rick, don't even just start barging in here.  He's like, oh my God, I can't believe you just said that.  But anyway, I just wanted to tell you guys that I had an awesome time.  Marianne?  And, yes?  What about us?  Are we kind of...  Please.  I thought you guys were awesome, too.  Please.  Oh, we get awesome.  Rick's the cutie pie.  Marianne.  I thought, you know, I thought...  Lovey, lovey, look at Marianne on the lesbian part.  Don't say...  You know what?  I have to tell you something, Matt. 
[02:28:00]  But we totally...  All Mariannes in the world are so sick of hearing the Ginger and Gilligan reference.  You think I'm happy...  Ah, never mind.  I don't know.  You're talking to a guy named Opie.  I think I deserve a little better than that, you know, considering, like, I came so close  to eating the peach.  Marianne?  Yes.  Am I at least a good-looking Opie?  Oh, you're a totally good-looking Opie. 
[02:28:30]  What are you, begging for compliments from Marianne?  Marianne was really hot on the couch.  Let's just leave it at that.  I'm just messing with her.  All right, Marianne, have fun.  I have to come back when I have more time and maybe bring Angela back.  Come back in the off-season.  All right.  Thank you, Marianne.  Okay.  You guys have a good night.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  There she goes.  Um, the moms I like to F contests is taking twists and turns we could never have imagined.  Is the blonde's, uh, pictures up yet? 
[02:29:00]  Are the blonde...  What was her name?  I forgot her name.  I was too busy looking at the beautiful pink bikini she was wearing.  Jeannie.  Jeannie.  Jeannie.  Oh, that's right.  Jeannie.  Jeannie.  Okay.  Yeah.  She up?  Let me go to Uncle John.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, I want to make a prediction.  Yeah.  You guys are on Late Night in Dallas?  Uh, yes.  After that segment airs tonight, I want to guarantee that nine months from now the birth  rate in Dallas spikes. 
[02:29:30]  Nice.  Hey, Adam.  Yeah.  Uh, great job on a Rob Reiner roast, man.  Oh, thank you.  You're welcome.  Take care, guys.  Take care.  My pal.  Three, two, one.  My pal.

What's up?  I just want to say that I watch Howard Stern every morning, and I just started watching  you guys because my friends gave me a tip. 
[02:30:00]  Watching?  Isn't it the radio, my friend?  Yeah, we don't do a TV show.  It's, Sean.  Listen to.  Listen to.  I'm not talking about a TV show.  I'm saying that you guys blow Howard Stern out of the water.  Oh, thank you, Sean.  I came back from Florida from school.  I heard you guys and just wanted to tell you guys are awesome.  Hey, thanks, man.  All right.  All right.  Ben, what do you got?  Well, she's coming in.  This is another good one.  Another good one.  Another yummy mommy.  We were one big happy family.  Wait, Pam, who was just on the lesbian couch.  Right.  She's on the phone now.  Pam.  Hi.  How are you?  Hi.  I just wanted to say, it was Marianne's first experience, and God, I gave her all the credit 
[02:30:30]  in the world.  Wow.  I just wanted to say, I'd much rather have Opie and Anthony on that couch.  So, like, am I, um, listen to this guy.  So, uh.

Another mommy?  Yes.  And, uh, how old's your kids?  Five and three.  Five and three.  And you're wearing, man, not much.  No.  It's like a ribbon for a present.  Wow.  How do you describe what that is, Ed?  It's, uh.  I know you said ribbon, but, um.  It's like ribbon.  The whole thing is just made out of ribbon, and it's got little flowery, ribbony clusters 
[02:31:30]  over certain areas.  Strategically placed clusters.  Where'd you get that?  I think Victoria's secret.  Vicky.  I haven't seen it in a porno, and he liked it, and then I found it.  I stumbled upon it.  It came in many colors.  This contest is getting better and better.  Wow.  Found it in a porno.  What porno did you find this outfit in, sir?  I don't know the name.  You don't know?  Well, whoever knows the names, who cares about the names?  Dishonorable Discharge.  It was a war movie.  You don't know the porno?  Was it?  You don't know the name?  Nah.  Can you describe it a little bit? 
[02:32:00]  Was it, uh.  Chick looking like that.  Chick looked like that.  And he said, honey, you need to get one of these.  Nice.  Walk around, look for outfits, point it out.  How long have you two been married?  Five years.  Five years.  She's keeping herself in shape for you.  Yeah.  Nice.  Well done.  I don't know who's going to win this contest at this point.  Now it's completely up in the air.  I can't even pick a favorite or anything.  I mean, the girls that are showing up are just amazing.  Very nice.  Did you take pictures yet, or you just got changed?

[02:33:00]  My brother has to get in on this one.  My brother, Elmo, who's a psychopath.  Elmo.  Hey, yo.  What's up?  First of all, I'm not a psychopath.  But this is completely off topic.  I need, I need a little divine intervention.  Yeah.  You know how, uh, whenever you root for a team or say they're going to win, they lose?  Yeah.  Well, we have a skeleton crew tonight on my softball team.  Yeah.  So can you guarantee that the other team's going to win?  Ah!  The Opie Sports jinx coming into play.  It's actually the Artful Dodger.  He can't do it. 
[02:33:30]  He did it for a little league team.  He felt bad for a kid.  So we already used up his one today.  No, the Artful Dodger softball team, they're really good, Anthony, and I'm guaranteeing  they win.  Guaranteeing the win?  Yes.  Yes.  By the Artful Dodger softball team.  Great.  Thank you.

[02:34:00]  Yeah, second place is a Samsung DVD VHS player combination.  No more fiddling with wires behind the wall unit.  Do you like your pictures?  I see that Rick is showing you your pictures, huh?  They look great.  They look great.  Well, you look great.  Look at you.  You've got a nice tan, too.  Look at that.  I see the little tan lines.  That's good.  Working all week on it.  Oh, really?  I'm going to go out on a limb.  You didn't breastfeed your kids, right?  Yeah.  No? 
[02:34:30]  No.  Look at that.  It's like a trend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You wanted to sleep.  Huh?  You wanted to sleep.  Hook them up to a machine.  I don't care.  I got to sleep, God damn it.  Cool.  Well, great, man.  Good luck, because, well, you don't need it.  No.  What am I saying?  Thank you.  Did any of that lesbian stuff, you know, interest you, or?  In a private showing with my husband, sure.  Yeah.  One of those deals.  Okay.  Well, when you're ready to go public, you know where to come. 
[02:35:00]  We're going to have the couch clean.  You can show me my life.  You call us with the IPO.  Yeah, that couch needs some serious cleaning.  The couch got more stains on it today than I think ever.  It really got...  They pulled it out of here.  My dorm room couch was cleaner than that thing.  It's funny, because people will come, you know, to the show all the time, and they all want to know which couch is the lesbian couch.  Just look.  Look around.  Hello.  The one you're sitting on.  Adam, the couch at the dorm was cleaner than that?  Was it before or after you tried to sneak that pig out? 
[02:35:30]  Here it comes.  In the morning.  Okay.  Listen, you weren't always Mr. Famous Radio Guy, you know.  Don't start with me.  I've seen some of the things you've dragged home.  You...  Don't start, you dick.  The funniest thing, we're playing up in Poughkeepsie, I guess.  When Adam was up in college, we were playing a gig up there.  His band of my band.  And we stayed, yeah, we stayed at his dorm room.  Oh, I love this story.  Yeah, yeah.  Stayed in his dorm room.  We've told this story five times already.  Good, and we don't have to tell it again. 
[02:36:00]  No, we've got to tell it for the new Marcus.  Oh, shut up, Ben.  So we go out, we play, we come back to the dorm room, and we're just crashed out.  That place looked like a flop house.  Yeah.  And we're all crashed out all over.  Now, you've been up all night.  Yeah.  You're drinking.  Yeah.  No way you're getting up at like 7.30 in the morning.  Mm-hmm.  Adam's up at 7.30 in the morning.  Quietly trying to bring the dancing bear out the front door so none of us would see her.  Yeah.  And the only reason he woke up is the bell around her neck kept going. 
[02:36:30]  Clang, clang, clang.  Bessie!  And everybody, the funny thing is, everybody just made believe they were asleep.  Yeah.  And he thought he was scot-free.  Goes back to bed, wakes up.  We all wake up, we're just, hey, Adam, who was the pig you were bringing out of the place?  I thought I got away with it.  I thought I got away with it.  She was big.  I got on top and I cut my ass on the ceiling fan. 
[02:37:00]  I tell you, those moms looked hot, though.  She was no, she didn't look like that.  Yeah, look at that.  That's amazing.  Hot moms for this contest, please.  And the husbands bring them in.  That's great.  Yeah.  Just showing them around.  Hey, we're going to extend the qualifying for this contest.  Oh, we are.  What a...  Oh, yeah.  Like, that doesn't happen with every contest we do.  The first few days of this contest, bah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, but you don't need a meeting for that.  We've just made a decision.  Yeah, right on the air, without a doubt.  Sometimes you've got to think on your feet.  So, moms, if you think you're as hot as the ladies we got up on WNAW.com, you can show 
[02:37:30]  up tomorrow, between 3 and 7, when we're on the air, and next Monday and Tuesday.  Yeah, we'll extend it.  Okay?  We found a song that we want to play for Adam Farrar.  Oh, boy.  What's this one?  It's our buddy, our pal, Stephen Lynch.  Because, see, Adam went out with your sister.  Yeah, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  What?  Have you heard this song yet?  No, I haven't.  Check this out.  Yeah, I got a little tune that I'm going to sing with my buddy Mark here.  Okay?  I wrote this because Mark and I have been friends for a really, really long time. 
[02:38:00]  Mm-hmm, and I think what makes us such good friends is that we're complete opposites.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's right.  We just, we like different...  Well, that makes us good friends, too, Rick.  Thank you for the...  Yeah, why is everyone doing the universal sign for BJ?  So, we wanted to celebrate the fact that we like different things with a little song.  It goes something like this.  All right.  I like my toast buttered, and I'll take mine dry. 
[02:38:30]  I dig the Beatles.  I'm a Stones kind of guy.  I have fine taste, and I like things cheap.  I want to stay up all night.  I just want to sleep with your sister.  What did you just say?  What?  He just said something...  No, I want to sleep.  All right, here we go.  You ready?  No, I'm not ready.  I love the sunshine way. 
[02:39:00]  And I want to nail your sister.  No, so you just said it again.  I like Julia Roberts movies.  I just want to F the S out of your sister.  Hey, Mark, you would rule.  Hey, if you'd say it's cool, I'd go pick her up at a junior high school.  Yeah, your sister.  Yeah, sister?  Yeah.  I think you're talking about my own sister.  I want to F your sister.  No, you're not F my sister.  I want to F her.  If I stick my fist in her feet, and I'm moving around, then I'm moving to her A.M., it'd be so effing great. 
[02:39:30]  I'd nail her dick to you.  I want to make your sister.  Stop it.  What?  I want to make one thing clear.  I do not like Julia Roberts movies.  All right, nice.  Look at that.  Steven Lynch.  There you go.  They dumped out of that?  They did dump out of it?  Oh.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Johnny.  The indication blows. 
[02:40:00]  How come they dumped out of that?  How many times did they dump out of that one?  Just once.  Oh.  Because they knew it was wrong.  Put that version on foundrymusic.com so people could hear how it's supposed to be.  There was nothing wrong with that.  Absolutely.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  See what we got to deal with.  Meeting.  Meeting.  Meeting.  So they wouldn't have dumped out of that if you weren't syndicated?  We haven't signed anything yet.  No. 
[02:40:30]  We've still got some leverage.  Hank, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You guys are great.  Thanks.  I got a story about sneaking somebody out.  We were out in the Hamptons one year and we were at a house.  So my cousin brought this chick home from the Bordy Barn.  So we get up the next morning.  We're up downstairs hanging out.  We're drinking beer at 8 o'clock in the morning.  My cousin talked this girl into going out the front window because she's a dwarf.  She's a dwarf?  She's having sex with a dwarf?  And climbing down.  You know how the houses are out there with the low roof in the front over the porch? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Talks her into climbing down the trellis.  The trellis lets go.  She ends up in the middle of the front lawn and there are about 12 of us standing at the  picture and looking outside.  Oh, God.  She comes down the stairs.  Well, now this is what?  25 years ago?  Every time he pays for that to this day.  To this day.  Busted.  All right.  Thank you, Hank.  You got it.  All right.  See a dwarf fall out of your friend's window.  All right.  Let's take a break because I've got to go down the hall and yell at someone.  And we'll be back with what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today? 
[02:41:30]  You've got to go, Adam?  I've got to split.  Oh, it's not like you've got a show at Caroline's tonight and all weekend long.  Yeah.  Go see Adam.  I want to thank you guys for a great day.  Wasn't it fun?  What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.  Sure.  Do you really have to go, though?  Yeah.  But I think you're cute.  Does that help?  He's got a gig.  You've got that look on your face.  Well, you know, I thought we were going to hang and stuff.  Maybe get some pictures of beer at Hooters or something.  But he's got something to do. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, all right.  I think you're cute.  Shut up.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  And thank you, mothers.  Yeah.  They still out.  Sure.  Sure he can hang for another ten minutes or so?  He's got to go.  He's got things to do.  Look at home.  This is new on you.  This is vulnerable.  It's kind of exciting to hang with someone that's on ABC and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Because syndication.  Oh, that's nothing.  Oh, ABC television.  You get that.  The syndication in 22 markets. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, you get that every week.  Are we really friends or is it like just the radio thing?  Of course we're friends.  Oh, okay.  Didn't I?  Come here.  Give me a hug.  You want to go on a lesbian couch?  No, I don't want a hug.  I just need a friend.  That's all.  Are you all right?  Yeah, I'm okay.  What's the matter with you?  It's not a Paxil day, is it?  All right.  Adam Ferrara.  Adam Ferrara.  Playing Caroline's all this weekend.  Go see him.  He's really, really funny.  You guys have redefined debauchery.

And for all the hot moms listening that are a little timid as far as coming down here for this contest,  you should come down tomorrow.  We treated everyone very nicely today.  Everyone has fun.  Yes.  Yeah.  We got some great pictures up. 
[02:45:00]  Great, great pictures.  Let's play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today, okay?  Yeah.  Let's go right to the phones.  What, Rick?  What?  That Stinky's pissed at me now.  How is Stinky mad?  Oh, because I introduced him as Stinky to Carmen Electra.  Like, that's going to matter.  Like he had a shot.  Like he had a shot.  Not like I had a shot.  It's just that instead of it being the coolest opportunity, it was I get to meet her and right away, we call him Stinky. 
[02:45:30]  And the look she gave me, like, oh, get your arm off of me.  Yeah, because you're really into Carmen Electra, right?  She was hot.  I couldn't believe how hot she was.  I'm not really into her, but when I saw her here, wow.  She's hotter in the magazines.  Yeah, that's really.  Oh, yeah.  But, like, she's hot.  She thinks, like, hey, you know what?  If I just introduced myself as Garrett.  No, I don't think that I was having a shot at all.  Hi, Mrs. Garrett.  Oh, Garrett.  But it would have been cooler.  Nice tool T-shirt, Garrett.  It's not like you're Stinky or something.  She's pretty short, too, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:46:00]  She's hotter in the magazines.  I'm telling you right now.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  When you think she's hot, just think of all the time she's been entered and miles and miles.  Aaron, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that even moms want muff, too.  That was the big one I learned today.  Right.  Oh, cool, man.  And also, Opie wishes mom would have won a hot pink thong.  Thank you, man.  Hey, syndications when old bits don't get dumped.  All right.  Tim, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up?  You guys rock, man. 
[02:46:30]  Thanks.  I learned that publicists suck and that I'm going to need a new box of Kleenex to go online  tonight.  Yeah, some good stuff to check out.  Thanks, Tim.  Right on.  All right, man.  Let's go to Scott.  Scott, what did you learn on the show today?  First, I learned that June 28th is the Opie and Anthony Mother's Day.  Yes.  So Mother's Day.  Second, I learned that Opie is self-conscious about, quote, his new look, referencing Mario  Cantone's reference last week, because he's asking all the girls if he's cute or not. 
[02:47:00]  And third, I learned that it's time for the new listeners of the Opie and Anthony show  to start using the line, you guys suck, instead of the traditional and much despised, you guys  rule line.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  Long live Chuck Radio syndication underground.  Bye.  All right.  Thank you, Scott.  Now, Gator from Long Island saying, he learned, if I don't go and clean the banana juice out  of my shorts, they'll smell worse tomorrow.  Oh. 
[02:47:30]  And Gay Marco, a little tip today on the show.  Yeah.  Stye from Queens, I learned that if black girl wears black shorts, it still looks like  he has black pants on.  Paul, what's going on?  Yeah, all right.  Hey.  Today, I learned that Jim Brewer's mom's been changing his pants for 34 years.  Yeah.  You guys rule.  We forgot about Jim Brewer and his mom.  That seemed like it was days ago.  Oh, yeah.  That was hilarious, too.  Let's go to Woodsy.  Woodsy, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I learned two quick things.  Yeah.  When you drink Stam Adams and Yeager, you get one awesome mom making out theme. 
[02:48:00]  Yep.  And Jim Brewer's mom loves to drink.  Yeah.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Jersey Gary, I learned if you're 14 and listen to O&A, you look like a...  A Glazed Donut, best line of the day, where's mommy?  And if you're a girl and hanging with Brewer, his mom thinks you're a whore.  Let's go to Big Mike.  Big Mike, what's going on?  O&A, yeah, I'm a big fan of you guys, man.  I'm a bus driver in the city, and I have a wow sign right in my front window, man.  So I learned that Jim Brewer's mom's a goer. 
[02:48:30]  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  See you, man.  Thank you.  Okay.  Uh, Uncle John.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys, I learned something very simple today.  Yeah.  I learned that mom upside down spells wow.  Yeah.  Mom upside down.  We had mom upside down, sideways, wrapped around other ones.  That move with the legs.  Holy Jesus.  That's called the scissors.  The scissors.  Remember the scissor move you used to do? 
[02:49:00]  Oof.  Bobby.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Bob.  Hey.  What's up?  Tell him.  Hey.  I learned the only way that Stinky will ever be remembered by a farm and electric is being  introduced as Stinky.  Yeah, that is kind of a drag for Stinky, Rick.  And you could tell Rick probably did that to, like, look.  Later, guys.  All right.  I don't know if that made it through.  You said that Rick totally C-blocked him.  Yeah.  That was a C-block move. 
[02:49:30]  Rick, that was a C-block move.  What did I do?  Saying Stinky.  I think it's ridiculous on both parts.  I think the Stinky thing.  I think Stinky's being ridiculous that, yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  Until I was Stinky, I might have had a shot.  Like, she's going to look.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Like, she's going to look at you and go, you know what?  This is a hot guy.  And Stinky's thinking, yeah, he's rubbing his hands together.  I can't wait to get her back to my place so I can share with my 62-year-old roommate.  All right.  I didn't think I had a chance with her, but I wanted the moment to be with her, not as, 
[02:50:00]  hey, you're Stinky.  And then her looking at me and like, all right, get your hands off of me.  Take this picture.  Let's go.  I don't know.  See, I think that's silly.  But then I think he was C-blocking you.  He was.  I was like C-blocking him.  By introducing him as Stinky.  That was so right.  New rule.  We introduce him as Stinky to everybody.  New rule on the show.  There's two guys associated with the show that has really bad names when it comes to  hot women.  One is me, Opie, and one is Stinky.  For now on, hot girls in the studio introduce me as Greg and introduce Stinky as Gary. 
[02:50:30]  New rule.  I want to be known as Kevin.  It starts that way.  There's three markets that didn't get that.  I don't want to be Stinky.  As soon as you won't want to answer the phone, since you'll think it's beneath them.  Steve, did you have something to add?  You ran to the microphone.  No, no.  I was just going to agree with Stinky.  That's all.  Oh, you don't think he should be introduced to Stinky?  Rick, I don't even know if it's intentional, but it's this C-blocking instinct, Rick, man. 
[02:51:00]  I was.  To just jump in and go, hey, he's Stinky.  Stinky.  Don't pay attention to him.  Hi, I'm Rick.  The producer.  I thought I was doing a nice thing.  He's running up to take a picture.  She doesn't know who it is.  I'm like, oh, well, that's Stinky.  That's C-block.  That's the guy everybody's heard about.  But from now on, I'm Greg.  That's Garrett when hot women are out.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Opie, I learned today that you finally found out where your mother was every time she was 
[02:51:30]  late to one of your little league.  Oh.  That's horrible.  You guys suck.  That is horrible.  That's funny, though.  What the hell?  You've got to take it if you're going to dish it out.  Fight club, fight club, people are saying that.  Rick and Garrett fight club.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned today that Opie and Anthony are the Jesus Christ of radio.  Yeah.  Hey, Opie. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  What's up with your family?  Does anybody have a normal name?  Your brother's name is Elmo?  What's your father's name?  Snoopy?  What's wrong with your family?  What are you guys missing?  A couple chromosomes?  What's going on?  Pretty much, man.  You guys are screwed up.  Hey, you guys suck monkey.  Hello?  Suck monkey something.  Oh.  Who's Rob the van driver?  Someone Rick C-blocked.  Rob the van driver.  Yo, guys.  Yeah.  All right.  The other day, I'm okay.  He's all right. 
[02:52:30]  We're hanging out on stage, and we're talking to a bunch of chicks, right?  And all of a sudden, Rick just comes along and thinks we're like BSing them, and he thinks  that we're telling these stories that we're like famous or whatever, and we were just  like, yeah, we work in promotions, and all of a sudden, he goes, he's just, this kid  works for CDs.  He totally C-blocked us, man.  Wait, so you were hanging with hot chicks, and Rick comes along to make sure they knew  that you worked for free CDs?  Yeah.  Like, you just sort of like, C-blocked us, dude.  I remember that, because Rick was bragging about it afterwards. 
[02:53:00]  He totally C-blocked us.  No way, dude.  He did it twice.  He didn't do it once.  He did it twice.  Oh, he C-blocked everybody.  Rick doesn't know how to hang with guys.  He came in the next day.  I wasn't there bragging.  Dude, you won't believe what I did to those promotions, dude.  Those suckers.  I screwed them.  He's a C-blocked.  It was horrible, bro.  I had to put Motown in their place.  Our promotion guys are cool.  He's like the lion on the plains of the Serengeti.  Anyone else that gets in there, get out.  It's my pride. 
[02:53:30]  All right, Rob.  All right, guys.  Don't be a lot.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  Professional C-blocker.  Jeff writes, what did I learn today?  I learned there will be one upset Little League player, but three very happy moms.  I learned Rick's a C-blocker.  That's what everyone's putting in now.  All right.  Hi, this is Steve C.  He's got herpes.  Hey, that's great. 
[02:54:00]  That is just great.  It's not like you don't.  I know, but they're not supposed to know.  This is Anthony.  For some reason, they call him Premature Anthony.  I don't know what that's all about, but I'm Rick, the producer.  That's Steve.  He likes to have guys mount his back.  Ben, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Hey, this is what I learned today.  I learned I could pleasure myself in my car on the GW Bridge without getting caught. 
[02:54:30]  True.  Get in the coffin.  Die, die.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I learned on a day like today, my underwear looks like a shoe polish rag.  Right, with all the heat.  Yeah, with all the heat.  And another thing I learned from a couple of days ago, that there's a new number to dial.  10-10-O-D-B, yo.  Later, guys.  All right, thank you.  We have to end the show. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  So thank you very much, and we'll see you guys tomorrow for FU Friday.  Opie and Anthony.  It's a road show.  Get up.  Opie and Anthony hit the Jersey Shore July 7th for an all-day road show.  At the Stone Pony in Asbury Park.  Wow.  The party starts at 1 p.m.  Hi, New York.  Hey, New York.  We love you.  What's up?  How was that today?  We showed them effers.  Just talking to New York now. 
[02:55:30]  What's up?  Showed them.  We're all going to be partying at the Stone Pony July 7th.  Yeah.  A week from Saturday.  And what else did I want to tell the people from New York?  Oh, shoot.  I forgot.  Poor Anthony from Philly got a great What Did We Learn?  And it's really cute to watch the people from the New Markets really try to get involved  with the What Have We Learned.  The 99% of them really suck.  Well, they're getting there, though.  They're getting there.  I mean, New York understands it, and they do the instant feedback, What Have We Learned?  But this guy, Anthony from Philly, I wish Philly was listening now because he goes, 
[02:56:00]  Seaman's Furniture would change their name if they knew about the lesbian couch.  That's good.  That's very funny, see?  Haywood writes, I learned Prozac is great with a Jägermeister chaser.  Jerry from Edison wrote, I learned no comment always means yes.  The lesbian couch is a freestyle event.  Marianne and her son in Little League both made it to third base today.  On the mound.  Both of them.  And it's a fine line between radio geniuses and effing idiots. 
[02:56:30]  Hey, we got some stuff to give away to just New York, Anthony.  Our pals.  Give me something.  New York, my pal.  We got some Run DMC tickets, yo.  Yo.  Your street, Opie.  We got three pairs of tickets to see Run DMC at the World on Friday.  That's tomorrow, yes.  Tickets are available now through Ticketmaster.  Yeah, three pairs of tickets to three random callers.  I'll use the New York phone number, 212-757-1027. 
[02:57:00]  They're using that The World thing now?  It's the WWF restaurant.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  They call it The World now.  They take you in the side door, and it's called The World.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  All right.  Anthony Sobe beverages.  Ah, so bad.  Ah, so bad.  It's specially formulated.  Uplifts the mind, body, and spirit.  Great tasting teas and fruit blends.
