<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous, Tarantino-esque interpretation of *Top Gun*, focusing on Maverick's supposed homosexuality.  This transitioned into a rapid-fire sequence of topics.  A clip of Tiger Woods yelling at himself prompted crude jokes.  A darkly comedic scenario involving Anthony's death with Brazilian meat on his face was discussed.  Significant technical difficulties with microphones and audio playback caused frustration and further crude banter with sound engineer Travis.  The hosts expressed their dislike for President Obama bowing to foreign dignitaries.  They criticized government bureaucracy and insurance companies after discussing a woman denied a bone marrow transplant due to a Medicaid and Social Security snafu.  A planned interview with Tila Tequila was cancelled due to her management's excessive restrictions ("Miss Tila," no Casey Johnson discussion, video approval required). Her music was briefly played and negatively reviewed.  Heidi Montag's plastic surgery was discussed, followed by a generally negative critique of reality TV shows like *Jersey Shore*, *Sober House*, *Keeping Up With the Kardashians*, and *Celebrity Rehab*.  A news story about Andy Dick breaking into a house was discussed, highlighting his continued struggles with sobriety.

The show continued with further criticism of reality TV, focusing on the lack of talent and exploitation of women in shows like *Celebrity Apprentice*, *Dancing with the Stars*, and *American Idol*.  *Keeping Up with the Kardashians* and *Pretty Wild* received particularly harsh and sexually explicit critiques, focusing on the female cast members' appearances. A caller provided additional information about Tess Taylor from *Pretty Wild*.  The hosts also expressed disbelief and cynicism towards Kitty Kelly's new Oprah Winfrey biography, making numerous crude and sexually explicit remarks about Oprah and Diane Sawyer.  Studio guest Rich Vos then shared a lengthy, comedic anecdote about his struggles with modern technology and movie rentals, contrasting Blockbuster with streaming services. The segment included promotions for Opie and Anthonyâ€™s European travel guide and Vossipedia Online, as well as Rich Vos's upcoming show.

A phone call with Rich Vos followed.  They played a movie-guessing game, eventually landing on "An Education."  The conversation shifted to Rich's technological ineptitude, his malfunctioning computer, and his struggles with Facebook. The hosts and callers provided comedic technical support.  The conversation touched upon Rich's diet, exercise goals, upcoming comedy shows, opinions on the Masters golf tournament, and his newfound interest in UFC fighting. The segment concluded with a discussion of Anthony's upcoming date with Taylor Vixen, Penthouse Pet of the Year, including detailed, sexually explicit comments about her appearance and a story about a caller vomiting after a previous segment about head cheese.

A highly graphic segment followed, featuring explicit discussions of body parts, childhood nudity experiences, detailed sexual experiences, and sex addiction. One host claimed to be a sex addict and described risky sexual behaviors.  The planned date with Taylor Vixen and the potential for digestive issues were discussed, leading to a proposed "diarrhea contest" idea. A phone call from someone clarifying company policy prohibiting discussions of bodily fluids and excrement caused frustration. A call from "Dr. Steve" provided medical commentary and further off-color humor.  A brief mention of Chan Ho Park's excuse for a bad baseball performance and one of the hosts' stand-up show also occurred, alongside a listener's phone call.

A segment focused on SiriusXM's censorship policies followed, with Rich Voss and Jimmy Norton as guests.  Restrictions on vomiting bits and the diarrhea contest were discussed, along with the lawyers' reasoning.  Rich Voss unexpectedly farted during a photo opportunity with Tila Tequila.  A YouTube video of an angry mother reacting to her son filling their house with energy drinks was played.  Jimmy Norton delivered a lengthy rant about self-absorbed individuals, using highly offensive language. The segment concluded with promotional plugs for Rich Voss's comedy shows.

The final segment consisted of a single, nonsensical statement: "I raised three, two and a half, two and a tenth kids. Thank you. Thank you."  No further context was provided.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, what's up? It's Sam from Opie and Anthony, and it's E-Rock from Opie and Anthony.  Sam, you know the movie Top Gun?  Yes, I do. I've heard of it.  I have not seen that movie until a few years ago.  What are you doing? What are you watching?  I don't know. I just never got around to watching the movie, and when I finally did...  Yeah.  That's really gay.  Well, yeah, that's one of those things you realize after the fact,  and that's one of those things that Opie, Anthony, Jim, and everybody else also realized after the fact.  Enjoy this clip.  More montages. Top Gun, yes.  One of the greatest montages ever, probably. 
[00:00:30]  That is the gayest movie ever fucking made.  Under the guise of not being gay.  Of being manly.  Right.  It was fighter jet pilots.  Why would you play this and not change your zone?  On a carrier.  On a carrier.  Of volleyball scene.  And all that stuff was supposed to hide the gay undertones.  The complete gayness.  Somebody recut, they took all of the most gay portions of this movie and just put it together into like four minutes. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, nice.  It's the whole movie.  It's everything but the planes.  Everything but the credits and the scappers name.  There really is a lot of parts to this movie where you're just like, what the hell?  Top Gun homosexuality.  Hey, uh...  What is that, Quentin?  Yeah, he starts off...  The video that I was talking about starts off with him explaining why Top Gun is the gayest movie of all time.  Yeah, I want to hear it.  I want to hear it.  I want to hear it.  Yeah.  What's the film about?  What's it really about?  What genre does it take?  What, like, it's like a spine?  The spine?  Like one sentence?  No, I don't fucking boy meets girl.  I don't give a shit about that. 
[00:01:30]  Fuck boy meets girl.  Fuck motorcycle movie.  No.  What is really being said?  What's really being said?  That's what you're talking about.  Because the whole idea, man, is subversion.  You want subversion on a massive level.  You know what one of the greatest fucking scripts ever written in the history of Hollywood is?  What?  Top Gun.  Oh, come on.  Top Gun is fucking great.  What is Top Gun?  Do you think it's a story about a bunch of fighter pilots?  Yeah, it's about a bunch of guys waving their dicks around.  It is a story about a man who struggled with his own homosexuality.  That's it. 
[00:02:00]  That is what Top Gun is about, man.  You've got Maverick, all right?  He's on the edge, man.  He's right on the fucking line, all right?  And you've got Iceman and all his crew.  Right.  They're gay.  They represent the gay man, all right?  And they're saying, go.  Go the gay way.  Go the gay way.  He's going both ways.  What about Kelly McGillis, right?  Kelly McGillis.  She's heterosexuality.  She's saying, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Go the normal way.  Play by the rules.  Go the normal way.  And they're saying, no.  Go the gay way.  Be the gay way.  Go for the gay way.  All right?  That is what's going on throughout that whole movie. 
[00:02:30]  He goes to her house, right?  All right?  It looks like they're going to have sex.  You know, they're just kind of sitting back.  He's taking a shower and everything.  They don't have sex.  He gets in the motorcycle, drives away.  She's like, what the fuck?  What the fuck is going on here?  Next scene.  Next scene, you see her.  She's in the elevator.  She is dressed like a guy.  She's got the cap on.  She's got the aviator glasses.  She's wearing the same jacket that the Iceman wears.  She goes, okay, this is how I've got to get this guy.  This guy's going through the gateway.  I've got to bring him back.  I've got to bring him back from the gateway.  So I'm going to do that through subterfuge.  I'm going to dress like a man.  All right?  That is how she approaches it. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  Okay.  All right.  But the real ending of the movie is when they fight the MiGs at the end.  All right?  Because he has passed over into the gateway.  They are this gay fighting fucking force.  All right?  And they're beating the Russians.  The kings are beating the Russians.  All right?  And it's over.  And they fucking land.  And Iceman has been trying to get Maverick the entire time.  Finally, he's got him.  All right?  And what is the last fucking line that they had together at all?  Hugging and kissing and happy with each other.  And Ice comes at the Maverick and he says, man, you can ride my tails anytime. 
[00:03:30]  And what does Maverick say?  Maverick, you can ride my sword fight.  Sword fight.  Sword fight.  Sword fight.  That's fucking it, man.  Fucking love Quentin.  Brilliant.  Quentin Tarantino, man.  The gateway.  The O.B. and Anthony show starts now.  Previously on O&A.  Fucking classic hearing Tiger Woods yelling at Tiger Woods.  Well, he was trying to.  Well, yeah.  It's kind of creepy.  It is.  He talks to himself in the third person. 
[00:04:00]  And, well, here's Tiger yelling.  And Tiger on the T, the hole in the upper back right quadrant.  Tiger Woods.  Suck.  God damn it.  I don't think he's pleased.  Tiger Woods.  You suck.  You suck.  I agree with Lydia.  Wow.  I hate to say that today, but I agree with you, Lydia.  Go ahead.  What did she say?  They're going to find Anthony dead in a hotel room with fucking Brazilian meat on his face? 
[00:04:30]  His wallet gone?  Wallet gone.  Are your knees cut out?  You're secretly hoping this is some kind of elaborate setup?  That would be hilarious.  I do, but I hope that she's a member of a new website called GetYourDateRapedByBlacks.com.  And they throw the whole thing.  Yeah, and they just fuck Anthony's butthole really hard while he's vomiting fucking Brazilian food into the tub. 
[00:05:00]  I'm a degenerate on the internet.  I like looking at pornography.  But then again, I will look up a lot of science stuff.  They would be confused by you.  Yeah, yeah.  They really would be confused by you.  There's no real pattern.  Like, I could run the robots, but I'd probably try to figure out how I could get them to blow me.  Yes, Jimmy.  If they took Anthony's computer, they would think that Roman Polanski and Hitler were roommates. 
[00:05:30]  Don't spit it here.  That's a piece of the pig's sinus.  The whole thing.  Yeah, put the whole thing in your mouth.  Come on.  I just threw up.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Put the whole thing in your mouth.  That's fucking...  That bone is...  Again, that might be one of his teeth or a piece of his tooth shavings.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  Swallowed it. 
[00:06:00]  P.N. Anthony.  Live.  Next.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony. 
[00:06:30]  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  P.N. Anthony.  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you. 
[00:09:30]  Thank you. 
[00:10:00]  We've got enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Huh?  Oh, except for this.  Yeah, except for this.  Oh, great.  Oh, great.  So the mics are blasting through the headphones, but everything else is really low. 
[00:10:30]  That's pleasant.  I want to go back to professional radio.  I want to go back to professional radio.  I don't know where that is anymore, to tell you the truth.  That's a good point.  I don't think there is any professional radio anymore.  So what sounds low and what sounds everything?  Our mics are cranking loud.  Right.  And anything else in the background, music, clips, I bet, everything else is going to be, like, I hear the music, but it's really low, right?  It's really low in the background.  And if he turns that up, then what? 
[00:11:00]  Then what happens?  The voices sound perfect.  I don't know.  But you don't even understand what we're doing to get our voices to this proper level.  It doesn't sound...  I mean, the music sounds bad.  Huh?  The music sounds really bad.  The music's really low.  Yeah.  Can you turn that up, Travis?  And that's way higher on the pod than you usually are, right?  So what happened since the last time we broadcasted that we have this issue now?  I have no idea. 
[00:11:30]  Something was touched.  Was anybody in here last night, or is it the ghost in the machine?  Who would want the mics booming and everything other than the mics unhearable, inaudible?  Amazing, right?  Like, how does it happen?  I don't know.  How does it happen?  I don't know.  Play a clip off of something.  Let's see how that is.  Just anything.  I don't know which one to play.  Boo!  Boo! 
[00:12:00]  Oh, here we go.  Hold on.  Like, um...  Like, um...  I just...  Like, um...  I was like, um...  I was like, um...  Keep fucking that chicken.  Like, um...  Keep fucking that chicken.  Okay?  Keep fucking that chicken.  Okay?  I know.  Keep fucking that chicken.  How about mine?  Look at this.  Wait.  I got nothing.  I guess they didn't...  Anthony, what happened to your buttons?  ...hooked up properly, or did somebody cheese-wiz it again?  Um...  Because I got...  I got nothing. 
[00:12:30]  Anthony's pushing his buttons, but nothing's happening.  The sound is...  Is this important?  No.  Is that important?  Okay.  Oh, is that it?  I'll try it.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  That's working now.  There we go.  Now it works.  Okay, great.  All right.  Now it's fixed.  That's great.  I fixed it.  Now, um...  All right.  This, uh...  That's wonderful.  All right.  How about the CDs?  Did you hit a CD, and let's see if that works, or if that's a clusterfuck? 
[00:13:00]  Just got to run through a little test.  We test, um...  During the beginning of the show.  Thank God Satellite Radio doesn't have ratings.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Let's see.  Here we go.  You should see my house.  You should...  That's really fucking...  I don't know.  It gets louder.  Oh, it does?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hold on.  Oh, that was a bad clip to use as an example?  Oh, okay.  Let me try another one. 
[00:13:30]  That was a bad one to start with, I guess.  Here we go.  Shocking allegations against Steven Seagal.  Okay, so it's just the music.  What are the allegations?  That he's fat with a bad show?  Who said that besides everybody?  Is that show even on TV anymore?  What are the shocking allegations?  Oh, man.  Shocking allegations.  He did indeed take an acting class once.  Nobody believes it.  Oh, good.  So the only thing that's fucked up is Travis's contribution to the show.  That shouldn't be an issue. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, poor Travis.  Oh, I tease with you, Travis.  You're a fucking golden cog in this machine.  We call the Opie and Anthony program.  Are we ready to broadcast?  I think we are.  We should try the phones out.  Oh, Christ.  That's the last test.  Those are a clusterfuck.  Guaranteed.  The answer to feedback I gave up on at 6 o'clock.  Can't get that, huh?  No, I just decide, fuck it.  Why bother?  Why would it work?  Hello? 
[00:14:30]  Hello?  Hello?  You're on the air.  Hey, guys.  Hello?  Hello?  This isn't a joke.  I'm going to fucking go apeshit in about two minutes.  Hello?  Hello?  Try another call.  Maybe it's his phone.  Yeah, it could be fucking.  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, hi.  Hi.  We got him.  Who are you?  My radio broke.  I'm only on hold so I can listen to this show.  My fucking radio.  All right. 
[00:15:00]  What happened, Warsh?  Oops.  He doesn't get to listen.  You pushed the button?  What happened?  A button?  What happened with the first phone call?  Pushed the button.  It was what?  Why would it be out of program?  Out of program?  No.  Everything was set up when I left here at 5.  It never fails.  I don't know how that happens.  I don't either.  All right.  What's the scoop? 
[00:15:30]  I don't know.  It's a fucking joke, isn't it?  I hate seeing Obama bowing to everybody.  What?  I hate seeing him bowing to this communist Chinese guy at his nuclear security summit.  You don't have to bow.  Shake fucking hands with people.  He's always bowing.  Yeah, you are the American president.  You should stand there and shake hands.  You don't bow to these motherfuckers.  Let them fucking...  The guy ain't even bowing.  The Chinese guy ain't even bowing to him.  And there's Obama hunched over.  Ho, ho.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Oh, disgusts me as a president. 
[00:16:00]  Stop it.  2012.  Please.  You can try to get the instant feedback to work.  In it feedback?  It's in it.  Mm-hmm.  And then some woman, you know how they're comparing the health care system with Medicaid and say,  we already got socialized health care through Medicaid.  That's the government subsidized health care system. 
[00:16:30]  This poor woman who's been going through chemotherapy with fucking cancer needs a bone marrow transplant.  Medicaid dropped her days before her treatment.  Why?  Because they're cunts.  And then people are going, oh, this is great.  Yeah, we need health care that the government runs.  Because this is exactly the kind of stuff they were talking about.  That they would look at certain cases, fudge some shit, and all of a sudden you're, you know, 
[00:17:00]  and no one will be refused health care.  No one will be refused based on their past health records.  And there it is.  She's there with a fucking skin bald head, chemo up the fucking ass,  and ready to get a bone marrow transplant, and Medicaid pulls her shit.  And so, first of all, they have, now that it's public, it has to be fixed.  Oh, they're going to try to fix it.  Here's the shenanigans that were pulled.  And if you don't tell me these are shenanigans, I don't know what shenanigans are.  Her son is apparently disabled. 
[00:17:30]  And she's got cancer.  Really rolled the dice on life.  That woman did.  But, so, Social Security sent a letter saying that her son, because he's disabled,  can start collecting Social Security.  This was unsolicited.  They just sent this fucking letter.  So the woman's like, wow, that's cool.  I have cancer.  I'm, you know, I have a disabled son.  Is he retarded?  I don't know what it is.  But he's eligible for Social Security money.  So they send him Social Security checks, a couple of checks. 
[00:18:00]  Then she goes to get this operation, and Medicare goes, oh, sorry, you're over the limit now for earnings because your son is making this money.  She goes, well, it's the government paying the money, and I didn't even ask for the shit.  Like, they just started paying it without any, telling me there would be repercussions about Medicare.  Right.  So she goes, look, I'll give back all the money that was given to me by Social Security for my son.  Right.  And don't send me anymore. 
[00:18:30]  And they went, no, it's too late.  So they cut her coverage off.  That's what bothers me right there is that there's no humanity.  No, no, it's all red tape.  It's the government and the insurance people.  They're all the same when it comes to that.  Trying to talk to one of these people, it's amazing how people have just lost their humanity.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't, there's no one.  I pay my sister's health insurance and my nephew's.  You're an angel.  Yes, but I also hit her a lot.  It just pays for the cuts and bruises.  But we were, I've gone through this thing where they were supposed to send her the bill or send me the bill. 
[00:19:00]  They were sending the bill to a different place than the, it was the address.  It was just a whole mix up in the address thing.  So I wasn't getting the bills.  So all of a sudden they were adding up and they weren't getting paid.  And I'm like, I haven't gotten a bill.  Send me a bill and I'll pay it.  And dealing with these fucking people at Horizon Blue Cross, I think, I've never dealt with worse people than people in the insurance industry.  Because they continually did the wrong thing.  And they still kept trying to throw charges and fees at me. 
[00:19:30]  A $25 fee for paying it on the phone.  I'm like, but you guys said you were going to send it to me.  And you didn't.  Well, sir, that's the rules.  That's what the, well, I'm like, do you, do you believe the shit you're saying right now?  Yeah.  I'm like, I'm like, do you, have you ever dealt with other people before?  And I'm like, I paid it because it's my sister's thing.  But it's like, they're fucking terrible, man.  You, there's no humanity.  Because they're so used to being bullshit of my people.  Yep, that's true too.  They have no sense of when they're being told the truth.  Yeah, they instantly think it's fraudulent. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  Some kind of scam going on.  I love getting that attitude over the phone when there's a legitimate fucking problem with something.  And I am not at fault.  And I call up customer service.  And I'm treated like, all right, all right, dirtbag.  So what?  Didn't pay that last bill or something?  No, everything, everything's in.  I got the records in front of me.  I always pay my bill.  Do you?  Yeah, really?  And you're just treated like a lump of shit because on their flow chart, you've hit the lump of shit box. 
[00:20:30]  And that's the branches that they're dealing out of.  But they treat everyone like a lump of shit.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Every single fucking person that calls customer service.  That's it.  Yeah, whatever.  It's just, I don't know what's going to be worse, though, is dealing with insurance companies or dealing with government bureaucracy like this clusterfuck that this woman's going through.  Because it seems to me to be just the same thing.  It's people with zero humanity.  And the government is known for not being able to run shit well. 
[00:21:00]  I think the government would be easier to deal with of those two.  Because there's always somebody in the government you can probably go to because they're elected officials and possibly get something done.  Maybe.  I mean, that's the only shot I can see you having.  That's the only hope you got.  Yeah.  The insurance company's a private company, you're fucking doomed.  Now that this woman's in the news, I'm sure things will be taken care of.  But, you know, there's thousands, if not tens of thousands just like her that are just getting fucked over. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  I'm glad I store bone marrow in my pocket.  What?  What happened?  I have extra bone marrow in my pocket.  Do you?  Just in case.  Do you want to give her a little, sprinkle a little bone marrow?  All right.  Listen, I think everything's said now.  So that's nice.  Yeah.  Hey, what are we doing with this Tila Tequila?  We're going to interview her.  Don't call her Tila Tequila anymore.  She's got a new name.  What's her new name?  Miss Tila?  Miss Tila? 
[00:22:00]  Who has all the info on this?  We decided, what the hell, we'll talk to Tila Tequila because she was, what, she was friends, she was dating, Casey Johnson.  When Casey Johnson died.  Yeah.  So we're like, fuck, that's pretty interesting.  Also, she's some kind of like one of these celebrities that doesn't do anything.  Doesn't do anything, yeah.  Which I would love to get into the mind of a celebrity that doesn't do anything.  Yeah.  Like a Kim Kardashian, a Tia Tequila.  There's a million of them.  And when you get right down to it, you don't even know why they're famous. 
[00:22:30]  Like, Kim Kardashian's famous, why?  Because she's not even the hottest girl around.  She's not even close to the hottest girl around.  No.  But she's extremely famous.  Why?  Why is Tila Tequila famous?  It's exposure.  You said it before, years ago.  You said, if you took a fucking grapefruit on tour.  Oh, right, right.  That the grapefruit would become famous and people would be like, dude, that's the grapefruit I saw on television.  Right.  But that's the grapefruit that was up on stage.  Yeah.  People would take pictures of it. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  It would get a reality show.  Yeah.  And it would be dating a hot celebrity.  Right.  That is what happens in the United States.  It doesn't take talent.  It doesn't take anything.  It takes exposure in front of a lot of people to become famous.  And then if you do something deemed provocative, then you're up to the next level.  Of like, whoa, did you hear what that, down by the water cooler, did you hear what she did last night?  But everyone wants to take their picture. 
[00:23:30]  And you're like, why?  Like, who are they?  And what do they do?  Like, Heidi Montauk?  Exactly.  Who?  Exactly.  But Heidi Montauk is all over the place.  And she's really famous.  And I don't know why.  Yeah, what does she do?  I think she was on the Hills.  She was married or she was going out with that other dude.  Oh, yeah.  That other douchey dude.  And then she got a shitload of plastic surgery, even though she's only 23.  That broad?  That's good.  You've seen her, right?  The blonde with the big boobs? 
[00:24:00]  I must have.  She actually looks plastic at this point.  Let's see.  She looks plastic.  That's her right there, eh?  Heidi Montauk.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen her.  Okay.  She was a pretty good-looking girl, woman, whatever.  And then decided to get a shitload of plastic surgery.  Have an attractive figure.  At 23.  That's her.  Oh, okay.  Look, she had a nice little look before the plastic surgery.  She looked like a regular kind of girl-next-door-ish, college-girl-y look to her. 
[00:24:30]  And then Post is like trying too hard to look glamorous in Hollywood.  You've got to find the latest photos.  She did a photo shoot out there in Vegas at one of the hot clubs.  It's Heidi Montauk.  She's famous, and I don't know why.  And she's keeping her fame going by having a lot of plastic surgery.  And she showed off her new tits at a club in Vegas.  Her new tits.  Near a pool.  She was wearing a little bikini.  Here's my new tits. 
[00:25:00]  I'm famous.  So it leads to this Tia tequila.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  That's her latest look.  Okay.  Wow.  She really went for the big old titties, didn't she?  Huge, over-the-top dress.  She went for the giant titties.  She looks completely plastic.  She looks ridiculous.  And she says she's not done with the plastic surgery.  Because that's her thing.  At least she knows that's now her thing.  This is why she's famous.  She's the girl known for having a lot of plastic surgery at a very young age.  She's a year.  23. 
[00:25:30]  Why would she do that?  Well, what am I asking?  Why am I asking?  Tila tequila, they offered her to us.  We're like, you know what?  Let's get into the fucking mind of someone that's famous for doing nothing.  So we're like, yeah, sure, why not?  And also, she was either dating or was friends with Casey Johnson.  I don't know what's official there.  She claims that they were engaged and married.  And she Twittered about it, I think.  All right.  So she was dating Casey Johnson.  Casey Johnson is found dead.  So we're like, all right, we could ask her about that. 
[00:26:00]  How did it happen?  Next thing you know, after we said yes to Tila tequila, all these rules started coming in.  Rules.  What were some of the rules?  First of all, she doesn't like being called Tila tequila anymore.  Right.  It's Miss Tila or something like that.  Secondly, don't stare directly into her breasts.  Was that one?  Probably.  That's probably one that we just said we shouldn't do.  Yeah.  Turned into stone.  I think there was only two.  Boner first.  No, there was a few.  And then we can't ask her about the Casey Johnson thing. 
[00:26:30]  No, not any way, shape, or form could that have been, that subject come up.  Right.  Where's E-Rock?  He was the one that was on top of this.  Where are the guys today?  On top of it.  How was it not crushed?  Whatever it was.  Early.  Yes.  If it was Cole, it was a diamond when he got off it.  Yeah, E-Rock.  E-Rock will have the rules.  Here he comes.  E-Rock.  Fuck, so what's the rules for us to interview this C-list fucking celebrity that's famous  for I don't know what? 
[00:27:00]  You have to call her Miss Tila.  I would never call her Miss Tila.  Hello, let's welcome Miss Tila.  In what world would that happen?  Not this one.  Fuck no.  Couldn't talk about Casey Johnson.  Which is a huge story.  Yeah, that's the annoying part.  By the way, that's the only reason anyone wants to talk to her.  Like, what the fuck?  What the fuck was that about?  And then we weren't allowed originally to videotape any of the interview.  But now they're allowing us to do it, but they have to approve the clips that we use. 
[00:27:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  My problem is just with the question.  Literally, he's telling you, get the fuck out of here, E-Rock.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  It's the question that bothers me.  Tell us we can't ask her about that.  That's to me where it's not.  All that stuff bothers me.  I'm not going to call someone Miss Tila.  We didn't have the sisters.  Your name's Tila Tequila.  And we videotape our stuff.  What?  They're only going to approve a shot where she looks good?  Like, from the right side or something?  It's just going to be a fucking videotape. 
[00:28:00]  It's not anything she's got to worry about.  Jesus.  But it's insulting.  I mean, if it was a much bigger celebrity, then you might play a little ball and go, all right.  Of course.  All right.  It's worth it because we're getting so-and-so on the show.  But not for this broad.  Yeah.  And we had to play her new song, which is what she's promoting.  And we all do the dance.  That was very funny.  Oh, God.  I got to give that present. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  That is funny.  Do we have the song?  One big bob.  Thank you.  I think Travis has.  How is it?  It's horrible.  Let's hear the song.  She's a singer now?  The song is called I Fuck the DJ.  No, it isn't.  Oh, really?  She has a song called I Fuck the DJ, but she has all these rules.  Go fuck yourself.  No, she means by playing it.  She fucked the DJ.  All right.  Let's hear this.  Are you ready, bro?  It's real low.  Remember, try it out.  Sounds original already. 
[00:29:00]  Sounds like a Casio demo.  Is that real low on the headphones?  Thank you for hearing it.  That's real low.  It's pretty low.  It's really low on the headphones.  And I cock a lot of shrill, bitch.  Motherfuckers be catching feelings, but I don't feel shit.  Oh, it's just that.  It's just that. 
[00:29:30]  She's like a very corny version of.  Oh, fuck.  Who's that rapper I like?  Oh, Macy.  I know who you're talking about.  The one that wore the plastic bag?  No, I only know her.  Missy Elliott?  Yes.  That's the one with her.  Yeah, she had a video with that fucking plaid bag.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Is it real low still?  Go fuck the DJ.  Is it low on the headphones?  No, I don't hear it that low on the headphones.  It is terrible on the headphones.  Yeah, it's awful.  It's not my stuff.  You know who will like this?  Like fucking 14-year-old girls who pretend that they're rapping, too?  No.  No one's going to like this, Jimmy.  Is Hits 1 going to play this?  No.  They're not going to play this shit.  This is something that they'll try to play in a club to make it like a big club sensation.  Right.  And the DJ will be all like fucking into it because she's saying fucking the DJ. 
[00:30:30]  At the club.  Radio's not playing.  Do you like this anthem?  Horrible.  It's horrible.  It's horrible.  Shut your gap.  This broad will be famous for another couple of weeks.  That's it.  Do you see a picture of her?  Right there.  She's...  I mean...  Wow.  She has good gams.  She cleans up hot.  Yeah.  She cleans up hot.  She should be throwing a fucking hat into a helicopter.  She certainly should.  Exactly.  What's going on there?  So where are we at with the booking? 
[00:31:00]  It's not going to happen.  Yeah.  I don't like fucking...  I don't want...  Yeah.  We don't like rules.  Content restrictions.  She's out.  We don't like rules with someone like her.  She's out.  Bigger celebrities that would bring some good shit to our fucking show.  Then we'll play ball a little bit.  Goodbye.  Come on.  I agree.  Goodbye.  We don't give a shit about your stupid song.  We want to talk about Casey Johnson and all that.  Talk about why you're famous.  And then as a goof, we throw you a bone and we play 15 seconds of your new song. 
[00:31:30]  And then you fucking hit the brick, sister.  Did she do porno or anything?  Yeah.  She gets naked on her webcam.  Is that it?  Oh, does she?  When she sees her popularity's dropping, she fucking gets naked and stuff.  I am.  Sam might know a little bit because he's into that dumb pop culture thing.  If she's not on the gossip blocks for a few days, she'll go to a supermarket in a thong and start bending over.  There you go.  Yeah.  And that's what I want to talk to her about.  That's good.  So, how bad do you want to be famous?  You have no real fucking talent. 
[00:32:00]  You will.  Can you see her, hiney?  Sam, what's the deal with this Tila tequila?  Miss Tila, Opie.  Well, she got famous when MySpace was big.  Oh, right.  She had a lot of followers.  Yeah, she had like 3 million followers.  Then she had the...  Hold on.  Why did she have that many followers?  Because she was posting hot pictures.  She just went viral.  Well, because she got in early.  Yeah.  If you get in early with this social networking, you do pretty well.  And then she did two seasons of her reality show and that got a lot of heat because it  was the first dating reality show where she was bisexual. 
[00:32:30]  It got heat?  Yeah.  From who?  The kids.  All right.  And now, yeah, now she hasn't really...  See, that's what she did recently to get some attention.  That would work.  That would work with me.  She's in a supermarket with some fuck-me heels.  Next to the meat.  Next to the meat fucking cake.  Next to the meat.  And she's trying to touch her toes.  In a very scantily clad.  Dude, I would just jerk off if I saw that. 
[00:33:00]  I really would.  I would jerk off in the supermarket.  Just jerk off in the supermarket.  We're not saying she's not hot, but...  I would take my dick out and they would have to arrest me and I would go, just show me  your asshole.  I have to.  She ended up naked on her live stream a couple months ago.  I do that occasionally.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's cool.  Crazy and just take my clothes off.  Her first TV thing was on Ted Nugent's reality show.  Ted Nugent had a reality show?  She was a contestant.  It was not well-received.  Oh, was that the one where they had to go out and hunt?  Yeah, she was on that. 
[00:33:30]  She was part of that thing?  Oh, was she?  But she wasn't Tila Tequila then.  Uncle Ted's going to...  Uncle Ted's reality show, we're going to teach you how to hunt and...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're going to teach you how to hunt your own food and kill it, so Uncle Sam, or I call  him Uncle Sap, doesn't...  I know you do, Ted.  That's actually what my dad would call Uncle Sam when he'd get mad.  Whenever the country does that, my father doesn't lie.  He goes, yeah, I guess we're Uncle Sap.  Oh, good point, Ted.  Jesus.  We are.  So what was the name of that show?  I know that show.  I don't even remember anymore. 
[00:34:00]  He had them all on his ranch, and they were all hunting, and she was like the pretty girl  who didn't want to get her hands dirty.  Did one get voted out every week?  Yeah.  Yeah, they voted him off.  Even though in real time, they were voting out a person every night.  Ted would just plunge an arrow through him with his compound bow, and they'd throw them  off the show.  You know what?  Take them away.  The biggest problem with reality programming it, when they started it with pretty much  the real world, really made everyone start looking at reality programming.  I mean, there was things before that, yes. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, but...  But they forced those fuckers to stay in that goddamn house for like a really long time.  Yeah.  And then they got lazy.  Like, fuck that.  We could do the same show if they're only in there for two weeks.  They need the turnover time.  Yeah, they figure the first season, there's like six or eight months or something.  It's crazy.  They figure if they put them in the house for a month and a half, two months, they could  pump out like four seasons a year.  But you got...  You know what it was?  You got character development.  You got to know the people and kind of almost give a shit what they were doing and interacting 
[00:35:00]  with each other.  Now, any real world commercials I see, it's fucking two supermodels in a hot tub making  out every fucking time.  And the first one was regular people from New York just, you know, this one's a student,  this one's a...  They just threw them in a fucking house and they lived together.  And now it's cast...  They cast it for the real world.  So it's not a reality show anymore.  It's a fake show called the real world.  Well, Jersey Shore. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  You started with the real world where they were in the house six to eight months.  Jersey Shore, what did they do?  Almost a month?  I don't even think they made a month.  I think they were in there for four weeks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it was like, it might've been six weeks.  It might've been six weeks.  Maybe.  Okay.  What is that?  That's the long side of it.  And you watch how much of a disaster Jersey Shore 2 is going to be.  When they're in Miami, they'll probably be in Miami for two and a half weeks.  No, I think they're going back.  To Miami, to Jersey?  Yeah.  I think they're going back to Seabright.  I think that whole Miami thing was like a publicity thing. 
[00:36:00]  Boom.  And I think they're going right back to Seabright.  I wonder if that was just to throw people off because they originally said the Hamptons.  I thought I read in the paper yesterday or the day before that they're going back to Seabright.  No, you're right.  They actually had the dates of the filming, June something.  They're doing a couple weeks in Miami and then they're spending the summer.  Wow.  Not to be honest.  That's merciful.  You have to see Tila's eagle talon feet.  Uh-oh.  She got big, nasty fucking Harris Hilton feet.  Richard.  Morning, boys. 
[00:36:30]  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Richard.  What's up, Richard?  Big, nasty fucking paws.  They always hide it in her pictures, but you'll catch a glimpse of it, man, in her heels and shit,  and her toes are pointing different directions, and she's got weird feet.  They should have bound them when she was a youth, when she was young.  They should have bound her little Chinese feet or wherever she is.  Bunch it out, boys.  She's part Asian, right?  Yep.  Part.  Let's see.  Oh, yeah, well.  Yeah, she's fucking hot.  There's no doubt about it. 
[00:37:00]  They're not as bad as that guy says.  Yeah, they're all right.  They're all right.  They're all right.  Paris Hilton has horrid feet.  The ligaments that go from the ankle down to the toes are all fucking, like, just poking out.  Well, they look like extra toes, the ligaments.  You know what I mean?  Oh, look at that.  Doesn't that look like extra toes?  They're giant toes.  She's got fucking...  She's got, like, shark toes.  Talons.  She's got a whole set of toes waiting to replace the one she's already got.  Yeah, if she loses one, another one just slips right into place. 
[00:37:30]  That is really fucking...  That's a turnoff, man.  And what's this Heidi Montag all about there, Sam?  Why is she famous?  She started on the Hills.  She's married to Spencer Pratt.  But even the Hills, why was she famous?  They followed her around, right?  Is she married to Spencer Pratt?  Yeah.  Oh, I fucking hate that dude.  And they were on, uh...  Yuck!  I'm a celebrity, get me out of here.  Right.  Mr. Pratt.  We played some clips of that.  He's the worst!  But they're basically...  Well, yeah, the Hills became a big show because people were just watching, like, these rich  kids in, like, California. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  That was all fake, by the way.  Yeah, of course it was.  Totally fake.  They were, like, three camera shoots.  They were, like, still cams and everything.  They tried to make it like a reality show, but it's, you know, on film, edited.  Yeah!  Right.  Fucking bullshit.  And so shit.  And now she's famous because she's getting a lot of plastic surgery.  That's the only reason she's famous now.  Now she did the 10 plastic surgeries in one day.  10 plastic surgeries in one day.  That's Heidi Montag.  Heidi.  Oh, I think you meant Tila.  That's what I've been trying to tell you.  No, I think you're saying still on Tila.  23 years old and she's had a shitload of plastic surgery already.  And so now she's doing the club thing where they pay him a whole bunch of money to make 
[00:38:30]  club appearances.  But she claims she's going to have...  I heard an interview yesterday, she said, she's going to have a career unlike any other  and she'll be doing a lot of movies very soon.  No, she won't.  She's going to be an...  She said she's going to be an action star.  None of these broads will.  Hopefully, Jesse James' mistress will be shitting on her in cam shows.  That would be fucking hot.  Ooh, do I love her.  So you're not digging the reality shows anymore, Ant?  Did you watch Jersey Shore? 
[00:39:00]  No, I saw...  Jersey Shore did bring me back a little bit.  You know what?  It brought me back a little bit.  I don't have to watch them.  But I know the second one's going to be a bust.  I watched The Soup.  I watched The Soup.  I watched Joe McHale make fun of some shit.  And if something funny happens on a reality show, he's got it right there.  I don't have to sit through the bullshit.  And that's it.  I'm not going to fucking try to get...  Invest my time in these idiot, fake characters for maybe one or two chuckles over the course of weeks. 
[00:39:30]  If I could suggest one reality show, there's only one I would suggest.  What?  Sober House.  No.  Sober House fucking rules.  Can't do it.  Kim Kardashian is...  I can't do it.  I can't watch these fucking B-list, C-list, D-list shitheads fucking talking about their problems  and how drunk they are or not drunk and they're getting recovered.  Fuck.  Sober House rules.  You got this...  But this Jen brought... 
[00:40:00]  I guess she was in movies for about two minutes.  And then she had some kind of major fucking, you know, drug or alcohol problem.  So she gets all sober.  And now she runs the Sober House.  And she's a...  Fuck.  She's a kook.  Yeah.  You know what...  And then you got all these whacked out fucking B-list celebrities in there trying to stay  sober.  The whole show's a joke.  Here's proof positive that reality shows just suck a dick.  Yeah.  Is the fact that Opie has named the greatest reality show ever over the course of three 
[00:40:30]  or four years.  And it's a different one probably every month.  So, like, even you can't keep, like...  Oh, no.  I don't have any attention on these dumb-ass shows.  You're absolutely right.  Oh, I hate them.  Well, you heard about Andy Dick, right?  Do we have the Andy Dick story?  Well, now let me tell you something.  When Andy Dick's involved in something, I'm watching.  He's a madman.  But see...  Oh, cocksucker.  This is why I think...  Literally. 
[00:41:00]  I kind of...  Jay Moore called me the other day.  Jay Moore.  The other day.  And he's going to be in here, I don't know, sometime this week.  He's got some big shows at Gotham Comedy Club this weekend.  And I told him Drew Pinsky's a joke.  And he said he absolutely isn't.  And I'm like, he's got to be.  Because none of these fucking celebrities stay sober for him.  He doesn't care.  Stop.  You see Drew Pinsky on the 16 and Pregnant.  Yes.  After what he's doing his...  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he's the go-to guy now.  Yeah.  And he's the one that gets very like, yeah, well, you guys take care. 
[00:41:30]  You're doing a great job.  He makes that face.  You're really going to have to step it up, I think, as far as your responsibility goes.  Because she's doing all the work.  And what you need to do is make more of a commitment to bloody, bloody, bloody, bloody.  Bloody, bloody.  Blah, bloody, blah.  Shut it.  I love bloody, blah.  Weren't you doing sex, provocative sex talk on the radio until the other guy went to the man show?  I mean, stop.  He was part of Love Line.  He still is doing Love Line. 
[00:42:00]  Which was a very famous radio, syndicated radio show.  Well, Andy Dick.  Now, I watched Celebrity Rehab.  And I watched The Sober House, Anthony, right?  Yeah.  What's wrong?  Just peering at somebody.  Oh, okay.  And Andy Dick comes to Drew Pinsky last season and goes, I'm ready.  I'm ready to get sober.  Is he?  Oh, yeah.  Because Sober House lost a cast member.  And then Andy Dick.  Oh, was it Sober House?  Yeah.  And then Andy Dick came in. 
[00:42:30]  I wasn't sure if it was Celebrity Rehab or Sober House because they're still fucking drunk and high.  So I don't know which one is Celebrity Rehab and which one is Sober House because they're still fucked up.  They lost somebody.  They lost a cast member.  They had to kick him out.  And needed a replacement.  And so listen.  And so thank God, Andy Dick, coincidentally, that was the time he thought he would go into recovery.  And listen closely because the punchline of this is going to be very good today.  I promise you this.  So Andy Dick has this moment with Drew Pinsky. 
[00:43:00]  I'm ready.  I'm an embarrassment to my son.  He doesn't even want to talk to me anymore.  I'm finally ready to do this, Dr. Drew.  I know I've disappointed you about 80 times before this, but I know I'm ready.  What did he tell Mr. Nagel?  So Drew goes, okay, you seem sincere and brings him into the Sober House.  And I think he ended up kind of sober, right?  I mean, they said, yeah.  Well, fast forward to today, April 13th, 2010. 
[00:43:30]  We have the latest on Andy Dick.  Okay.  Who, remember, was ready to make a new start.  To make that change in his life.  To make that change and get sober.  So he's not an embarrassment to his family and his son.  Doesn't want to be an embarrassment.  Here we go.  Emergency.  Hello?  I'm calling 911.  Get him out.  Get him out.  What's going on?  I have an intruder in my house.  Okay.  What's your address?  I'm sorry.  He just walked right into my house, but I don't think he's trying to hurt us. 
[00:44:00]  Are you still in the house?  No.  My husband just took him outside.  Is he drunk?  He's, I don't know, he must be something.  He's definitely under the influence of something.  But my baby is here and my husband's outside with him.  I'm very scared.  Please send a cop here now.  I'm hearing the guy shouting and I'm hearing my husband saying to calm down.  I don't know.  All I know is he walked right into our house.  She needs broad view security.  He said, I am not with the fire department.  He's absolutely loony.  He's definitely wasted. 
[00:44:30]  I can't, I'm listening.  My husband's fine.  There's no one being attacked right now, but he's okay.  I'm looking, I can see him.  He said something about, he thought his son lived here.  He's really off his rocker.  Yeah, you guessed it.  That's Andy Dick.  Andy Dick broke into their house.  Son's house.  Andy Dick and he breaks the window.  Hi, this is broad view security.  Can we help you?  Andy Dick just broke into my house.  Yeah.  Send the black police.  Another Drew Pinsky success story is now wandering into fucking houses. 
[00:45:00]  If you have to be home invasion, Andy Dick is the guy you want to break it in.  Yeah, of course.  He's really not threatening.  He's a little frail.  Yeah.  Another success story.  I think we share the same agent as Dr. Drew too, but fuck him.  I mean, he has no good success stories.  It continues.  What does he look like?  Can you tell me?  Oh, no.  He can't.  Is he white, Hispanic, black?  No, he's white.  He looks like well-to-do.  Actually, he looks like a rich white man. 
[00:45:30]  Now, is it possible for you to tell me what this guy is wearing?  Well, he has eyeglasses on.  A pair of slacks.  What are you doing?  He's going over to somebody else's house right now.  No, you can't follow him.  Yeah, I said, Dora.  What's your, you can't do?  And now my son is following him because he's going over to somebody else's house to do the  same thing.  My son is walking after this guy.  I hear a lot of yelling now.  I'm outside and I hear yelling.  I'm pretty sure that's a cop up there. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Are the men there?  Yeah.  My deputies are there with your husband and the guy.  There you go.  So, uh, Andy Dick.  That's Andy Dick.  What does he look like?  He looks just like Andy Dick.  Why does anyone ever say that?  He looks like Andy Dick.  Yeah, why not?  Make it very easy for everybody.  I don't know anything funny he's ever done.  Like, I don't know anything unfunny either.  I don't know his work.  I literally don't know what he does.  News radio.  Yeah.  It's quite the show.  Right.  A lot of people enjoyed the news radio. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I thought that was funny.  The well-to-do thing.  Yeah.  Well-to-do.  But the point is, he was part of this sober house.  Yeah, this is post-sober house.  You know, had the dramatic fucking meeting with Dr. Drew.  They had the music just right.  You know, that fucking dramatic music.  Yeah.  I'm ready to make a change, Dr. Drew.  Went through graduation.  Did he go through graduation?  Sober house graduation.  Went through sober house graduation.  Well, he graduated to home invasions, apparently.  So he's doing very well.  Why are they putting Dr. Drew on TV? 
[00:47:00]  I don't see any success stories with this guy.  Because he makes that sad face.  Right.  He can make that.  He purses his lips and he makes that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to have to work a little harder on that, don't you think?  What do you think the problem is?  Oh, that I like to fucking just pound drinks down and break into people's houses?  Maybe that's it?  Andy Dick.  Wow.  That's a big one.  Yeah.  He's lucky he didn't get a fucking .45 in the chest.  No kidding.  Yeah.  I just shot Andy Dick and broke into my house. 
[00:47:30]  The best part of the story is that this family seems scared of Andy Dick.  Yeah.  It's Andy Dick.  I mean, come on.  Yeah.  That's why she wasn't really panicking on the phone.  I'm sure anyone would be alarmed if someone's in your house, but then when you realize  it's Andy Dick or someone that looks kind of like an Andy Dick, how scared are you really  going to be?  Right.  That could have been a problem.  Right.  So there you go.  Tila Tequila will not be on our show today. 
[00:48:00]  Kim Kardashian's getting another reality show.  What is that one going to be about?  How many sub-reality shows are there from that?  Well, here's the thing that's a little bit conspiracy theory to me.  Her Keeping Up With The Kardashians show is on E!  E! News.  Which, by the way, right next to Sober House is my second favorite reality show.  It's a good show.  Oh, really?  Because Bruce Jenner's in hell.  You got to see just to see.  I've seen the show.  Dude, he's the only one in the house that has real fucking talent. 
[00:48:30]  Wow, really?  That's sad.  Dude, he won a gold medal for this country.  And these fucking spoiled brat fucking daughters of his don't give a shit and treat them like  crap.  Well, he does look like an old lesbian.  Well, their real father's dead and got a murderer off the hook.  Well, he's got two of his own biological daughters in the house.  And then he's got the three Kardashian girls he's been raising most of their lives.  And they just sit around in couches and talk about how hot they are and where they're going 
[00:49:00]  to bottle next.  And they're really famous.  And then here's Bruce Jenner walking in.  They laugh at him like, oh, look at that stupid idiot.  Of course they do.  And Bruce Jenner was a fucking Olympic champion.  And all they do is have sex with black athletes, right?  Well, that's the thing.  E! News.  It's on E!  Yeah.  E! News was the first to report that she had broken up with Reggie Bush.  Oh, boy.  And now E! has picked up the new Kim Kardashian is looking for a new boyfriend show. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  So what?  Is she going to troll NBA locker rooms?  Well, I don't know.  And as such?  Meet some nice young men.  Yeah.  It's embarrassing.  Just go through the penal system.  Pick yourself out a boyfriend.  Is she going to just drive through the ghetto with her asshole up in the air?  Yeah.  Just fucking getting out every block, doing the ass dance.  Right.  Where they just bend over, grab their fucking, and butt clap.  She'll just booty clap her way through fucking Harlem. 
[00:50:00]  I would watch that show.  Until somebody sticks a dick in her.  You don't watch Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Ant?  No!  You've seen the clips on the soup, though, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I've seen it.  Obviously, she's hot.  But as soon as she opens her stupid mouth, there's nothing coming out of it.  No.  She's as boring as they come.  I saw an episode where they were talking about how she works too much.  She never takes a vacation.  She's always working.  Really?  And her working entails sitting in a chair while they do her makeup and hair, and then  she walks out in a bikini.  They take a few shots. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Her big break was coming with her Arby's commercial.  Don't they go to clubs and say, hi?  Yeah, they do.  And then they leave and make a fucking huge amount of money.  It's the same thing like Heidi Montag does that, too.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  And then they fucking come out.  They get like 15 grand or something for showing up at a club.  Insanity.  Yeah.  Stupid fucking that little slob from Jersey Shore.  Snooki?  Snooki.  Yeah, she gets like five or 10 grand per club appearance.  And she's like going everywhere. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Like she'll do three clubs a night.  Yeah, but they said about Snooki, I think there was an article yesterday, she made $2,200  last year.  Yeah, well, think how much cash she's pocketing.  Well, she was a loser that got cast for this dumb show, this Jersey Shore.  Yeah.  She was on.  She's going to be famous for like, I mean, no one's going to give a shit about Snooki.  She's not as famous right now as she has been already.  She's on the downslide.  Already, right?  Already.  A shooting star.  She was at the peak when a fist punched her in her fucking face. 
[00:51:30]  That was her peak.  Who's that?  Is that Kim Kardashian?  Kim Kardashian's ass.  She has a great rum.  Yes.  Of course she does.  But that's.  Are there little farts coming out of that?  Jimmy's always got to make it sexier.  Wow, she's a good ass.  But that's why she's famous.  That's it.  Right there.  Her ass.  Her ass.  That is the only reason she's famous and on TV.  Dude, that's more than enough.  Wow.  You know what, Jimmy?  But you got real talent.  You would like a nice little fucking TV show, wouldn't you?  They give these TV shows to these fucking people that have absolutely nothing happening. 
[00:52:00]  If I had that ass, I would just tuck my head between my legs and lick my own asshole  and roll down a hill like a fucking tire.  Sure.  I'd lick gravel out of my own crack and call it a day.  Is there any way of getting clips where these broads, the daughters, and that stupid  wife of his beat up Bruce Jenner?  Yeah.  I mean, I could look into that.  And see if it's worth playing.  Sure.  Because I sit there like, he was an Olympic fucking champion.  Give him a break.  That was yesteryear.  They laugh at him like, oh, yeah, but are you working on a perfume? 
[00:52:30]  That was 12 plastic surgeries ago for him.  Yeah.  They have a store.  Yeah.  The Kardashian girls.  So they're actually working at this.  What's the name of the store?  It's very clever.  It's Dash, as in Kardashian.  Right, right.  Dash.  We're opening up a new Dash.  Yeah.  But they don't even work there.  They just show up.  They don't.  And look at their fucking iPhones and Blackberries.  And watch some chick that's making minimum wage fucking hassle her.  Chick making minimum wage, sweating her balls off, working her ass off. 
[00:53:00]  The real criminal here is Ryan Seacrest, who's producing half of the reality shows on TV at this point.  Is he?  Yes.  Fucking cunt he is.  He's an asshole.  Fuck.  Whatever.  The fuck did we do wrong?  I don't know.  We're not vulture-ish enough, believe it or not.  I guess if we had nicer asses, I guess we could be on TV, right, Sam?  Yeah.  I would watch.  You know what?  Why don't we just try to shake our asses some more, eh?  We exploit girls, but not as well as we can.  We've got to look at how Ryan Seacrest is exploiting women and go that route. 
[00:53:30]  But he does it with a smile and he's still milquetoast.  But, you know, behind its closed doors.  The key is to not have an interest in women.  Oh.  And then you can produce a lot of TV shows.  There's a problem.  And I'm not talking about anyone.  I'm just thinking that might be the way to go, eh?  So why is a man with Dick doing it?  I think Seacrest is producing the reality show that you like. 
[00:54:00]  Ah, that's the only one I like.  And I don't even watch it, but if it's...  Which one?  If I turn around.  It's the three sisters.  Yeah.  The one we talked about before.  The ones with the...  They robbed houses.  Yeah.  And they're not in jail.  I saw the episode where the girl was crying because she lost her modeling contract because  she robbed houses.  Yeah, she robbed houses.  These girls are so hot.  This is how fucked up the entertainment world.  Yeah, pretty wild.  If me and Ed went on a robbing spree, we'd be in jail.  We wouldn't be on TV and have our own reality show. 
[00:54:30]  They just lost the modeling gig.  Yeah, they're much prettier than you guys.  I'm sorry to say that.  I understand.  It's all about how pretty you are and not having any talent whatsoever.  Just jump in the middle of that and just start spraying fucking clear stuff all over.  The one on the left is ridiculous.  Which one is married to the Laker?  No.  They're not going to show, Jimmy.  Those are the pretty wild girls.  Those are the girls, but white guys.  I literally would have said, those are the Kardashians.  I would have said, oh.  Of course.  Well, it's all the same.  They're using the Kardashian model that works.  So now they're like, well, we got three more sisters that are brunette. 
[00:55:00]  It's like, let's get them out there drinking and sucking cock and we'll just film it and  see what happens.  Right.  See, I have a reality show I'm pitching and it's getting passed away for garbage like this.  It's like three girls, like all of them are like 5'5 and they weigh like 170, 180 and  all of them have at least one rotting tooth that they need to get fixed because whenever  they drink soda, they leave bad breath on it.  And they're all trying to get money to get their rotting tooth replaced.  That's a good one. 
[00:55:30]  Let's pitch that to E.  That should get picked up.  That sickly sweet meat smell of a rotting tooth.  Let's just start bothering E with our fucking show ideas.  Of course, they're going to take meetings with us.  The Victoria's Secret model got voted off or got fired from Celebrity Apprentice on Sunday.  Why?  She didn't fight for her job.  Did he say, you're fired?  Oh, it's just good.  You know, years of him saying that.  It doesn't get old.  No, it was great. 
[00:56:00]  No, definitely it's old.  Thank you, literal Jim.  You're watching Celebrity Apprentice?  Yeah.  Why?  I love Celebrity Apprentice.  Why are you watching these shows?  For what reason?  I love Apprentice.  You're not actually going to get a job with them.  Your brain rots away.  For charity.  Why?  Rots away.  I hope you're sitting there one day and your brain just oozes out your ears and you go,  what happened?  Oh, it was a fucking reality program.  Yeah, you explained to us why you like Celebrity Apprentice.  Well, I like seeing them do the tasks and I like seeing them fight for their jobs.  And I like when they call their famous friends and you never know who's going to pop up. 
[00:56:30]  If they're making cupcakes or something.  I don't even have a button for this.  I don't even have a button for this, Ant.  Do you have one?  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  I have nothing.  I hope...  That sounds like dog shit.  I hope you're talking and then you just have a stroke like Edmund Muskie.  Muskie.  He's used way too much on our show. 
[00:57:00]  Dude, he's the only guy I want to talk about Edmund Muskie fucking brr-brr in the middle  of his fucking speech.  Oh, that's great.  Celebrity Apprentice.  But everyone's watching it, right?  Big ratings for this show.  Sharon Osbourne and Bret Michaels and Maria are all still on it.  Oh, good.  Wow, Sharon might win.  Yeah, she's looking good.  She's looking real good right now.  The biggest waste of time show is that Dancing with the Stars, though.  Even I can't watch a full episode of Dancing with the Stars.  At least American Idol is like, all right, you can see...  I'll watch American Idol.  You see these fucking people that... 
[00:57:30]  Dancing with the Stars is ridiculous.  It's horrible.  It's awful.  But everyone is watching.  Huge, huge ratings.  That one's really bad.  This country's doomed!  How many million?  Like 28 million or something?  I mean, it's just watching.  It beat out Idol one weekend, right?  Yeah.  One week last week, right?  And it's just like karaoke versions of songs and ballroom dancing.  I don't understand it.  They had a clip of Jeffrey Ross' old dancer.  Because Jeffrey Ross' old dancer actually has someone that could dance now with her. 
[00:58:00]  So she's still on the show.  Holy shit, is she fucking hot.  Yeah.  What was her name again?  Ida?  I think so.  I don't remember the dancer's name.  Ida fucked her?  I get it.  Get it?  It's one of those name things.  Let's get Andy on Long Island.  Andy.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Morning.  Morning, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  And I just want to let you know, that show you were talking about with the three chicks  from Pretty Wild.  Yeah.  One of them, Tess Taylor.  It was in Playboy.  And you could see her giant titties.  Oh, yeah?  It was awesome.  Yeah. 
[00:58:30]  Nice.  And they were both, if you check their IMDb, they were also both in a movie and they make  out with each other topless.  Jesus.  Wow.  Check that shit out.  All right.  We got to check that out.  Wow.  Dancing with the Stars.  I think it's Tess Taylor.  The one that's in Playboy.  All right.  Yeah, well, we'll...  Actually, they're not actually, like, biological sisters.  No?  Well, they're hot anyway.  Check that out on IMDb.  Then they should just lez off with each other.  All right.  We'll check it out.  But only in Hollywood, you could fucking rob homes and then you get a reality show.  Yep.  It's fucked up. 
[00:59:00]  I don't know.  I don't get it.  I don't get any of these stupid fucking shows.  And the Ted Nugent show was called Surviving Ted or something like that?  Yeah, that sounds right.  Oh, God.  It only lasted one season.  And I think the reason it lasted one season, the person couldn't wait around anymore, somebody  got hurt on fucking Ted's ranch.  Is that true?  Oh, yeah.  I think so.  A pending lawsuit, perhaps?  Did someone get an arrow?  It was a long time ago.  Arrow to the shoulder blade or something?  Maybe that happened.  Yeah.  Goddamn forbidden.  403 code.  I hate that.  What does that mean?  I always get that.  Nah, it means you can't see the picture you want to see. 
[00:59:30]  Well, that's not nice.  Where are those pictures I was supposed to see?  Well, that's not...  That's her.  I want thumbnails.  Or forbidden.  God damn, is that hot?  Holy shit, is that her?  Holy mother of Christ.  That's her?  Jesus H.  She has big, heavy bosoms.  Yeah.  I want to feed off them.  Holy shit.  You want to feed?  I want to nurse off her giant lips.  Feed.  You want to find the milk ducts?  Oh, God.  You want some milk from the milk ducts?  Yes.  Is that her hiney?  Ooh.  Wow.  Is that an implant? 
[01:00:00]  The fucking nipple's a little too high.  What's that about?  Yeah.  Something going on.  Some girls just look better scantily clad than totally nude.  Yeah, well, she's got a nice face there.  Hang on, though.  Nothing wrong with her.  Hang on, though.  Yeah, that's a good face to look right into.  Let's see where the shit comes out.  Yeah.  Do they have the place where her duty slips out of her hiney hole?  Do we have the place where the diarrhea leaks?  I want to see the place where the Olean leaks.  Show the dirty brown spot where Poopy comes out. 
[01:00:30]  Exactly.  How immature.  I know.  I love that.  Her face is ridiculous.  That'll launch a thousand ships.  What's her name, Danny?  This is Tess, T-E-S-S, Taylor.  Tess Taylor, if you guys want to check it out.  Google image that shit.  Very pretty.  I like the crucifix tattoo on her fucking upper hip, right?  It's really Aussie.  Holla.  It is, right?  Holla.  That's nice.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Let's say hi to this guy. 
[01:01:00]  What's up, buddy?  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  How you doing, Jimmy?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Kim Kardashian just did this spring the Grand Marshal of the NASCAR race out there in L.A. promoting her perfume.  Oh, yeah?  That sounds fantastic.  She's very enterprising.  Fascinating.  She's enterprising because she's a piece of ass, though.  I wish I could have been there.  Nothing comes out of her mouth worth hearing.  I wish I could have been there.  I bet her perfume smells like, it's probably like the drips of her ass sweat in a bottle. 
[01:01:30]  I'd buy that.  Smells like interracial sex.  Yes.  Come in tears.  Mace.  A little mace thrown in.  Come in mace.  The best episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Ed, and then we can move on.  See, now, Kim's mom is a jealous twat.  Oh, yeah?  She's jealous of her children.  So Kim Kardashian gets into Playboy, so the mom's like, well, I could do Playboy, too. 
[01:02:00]  And she did it for Bruce.  Yeah.  And because Bruce Jenner was an Olympic hero, this fucking twat of a mother and wife gets  a, uh, uh, uh, an American flag to cover up everything that is wrong with her whole body.  Yes.  And I think, I think technically she was nude for this, uh, pictorial.  Oh.  With the flag.  With the flag covering up everything.  Oh.  Do you have her, do you have fucking, uh... 
[01:02:30]  Did she show...  Yeah, there you go.  See, look.  Oh, look at her.  She's covering everything up.  Covering everything up.  I wouldn't mind fucking hitting that, though.  Those big, juicy legs up in the air.  Why didn't she show the little hole where the cocky comes out?  Damn.  I want to...  Ooh.  I'm not sure.  I bet, you know, those old lady legs would feel great wrapped around you.  I want to see where doo-doo comes out.  Where the cocky is.  Where her cocky comes out of her.  I want to see, I want to see where the fucking, the part that puckers, like the inside of an  olive. 
[01:03:00]  I want to see where the period juice leaks out.  Yeah, let's see that, too.  I want to see where the fucking baby heads pop out.  God.  That is so immature.  Yeah, I want to see the fucking, the hole that's launched a thousand untalents.  I don't know why it's so funny.  It's so immature.  All right.  I watched, see, now, instead of a reality show, I watched Primal Fear last night.  Haven't seen that in a while.  Now, that's a good fucking movie.  Edward Norton.  God damn it. 
[01:03:30]  Playing the fucking, playing just the little, you know, timid guy.  I didn't kill anybody.  And he turns into Scumbag Roy.  Yeah.  That's good.  John Locke is in that, too, by the way.  He's got mustache and side hair.  So that means, yeah.  You didn't hear David Hasselhoff hosting Raw and what he said when he got in?  No!  Why would I watch that?  I was hooked.  What did the Hoff do?  Did he sing?  Well, he came out to his song.  Did he sing I'm a Knight Rider?  He drove Kit to the ring. 
[01:04:00]  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  No, he did not.  Yes, he did.  Did he drunk drive all the way to the ring?  Was he eating a burger, driving and running over fucking patrons?  How many WWE fans are now paralyzed because fucking Hasselhoff decided to drive Kit to the ring?  Fucking goddamn drunk.  Michael, you're drunk, Michael.  He got in the ring and proclaimed that this episode of Raw would be Hoffsome.  No, you heard wrong. 
[01:04:30]  No, no.  No one is stupid enough to say Hoffsome.  Was this last night?  Yeah.  Can we get the audio?  Certainly.  We got to hear David Hasselhoff.  I want to hear the Hoff.  Okay.  We got to hear the Hoff.  And what he's promoting and what he's doing because it's all a commercial.  Didn't get kicked off of America's Got Talent?  I think so.  I think they went with somebody else because the fucking guy couldn't stay sober or something.  Because he was a good part of that show.  That's Hoffel.  Should have just been, I'm Hoffel. 
[01:05:00]  He did not say Hoffsome.  Hoffsome.  It doesn't even work.  No.  It's not awesome.  And Hoff don't rhyme.  Oh, is he terrible?  He had one of those every week on America's Got Talent.  I can't remember any of them anymore because they were so not memorable.  When he put his book out, he was putting out all his t-shirts that, of course, said his  catchphrase, don't hassle the Hoffs.  In Hoffs.  Decated.  Is that one?  Is that one? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, God.  Fuck him.  All right.  What did we get done this first break?  He's absolutely nothing.  He's a jerk Hoff.  There you go.  Oh, yeah, Chip?  This guy would take the volume on his TV and put it on the Hoffs pot.  We're going to take a break.  Rich Voss is going to be in studio at 8 o'clock.  All right.  And everybody on their prep sheet, scratch off Tila Tequila.  Fuck her. 
[01:06:00]  That's it.  Fuck her.  Fuck her stupid music.  Done.  Fuck her demands.  Go somewhere else.  Open it.  So, can they hear that in the background?  It seems just really low today, everything else.  That seems really, really low in the mix.  Does it sound good to people out there?  I don't know.  I mean, if it sounds good for the people out there, then I'll shut the fuck up. 
[01:06:30]  No problem.  Travis is playing a little Floyd because it's 30 years, right?  Roger Waters will play the wall in its entirety this summer on tour to commemorate its 30th anniversary.  Wow.  30 fucking years.  Opie and Anthony.  What does Oprah's book hit?  Is it today?  It's Tuesday.  It's usually when books come out.  I think so.  It might be today.  I think everything is released on a Tuesday, right?  Tuesday, right, yeah.  Tuesday.  Well, what do you think of this Oprah book?  I don't know. 
[01:07:00]  I'm going to get it.  I mean, there's like a weird media blackout on a lot of it, like Kitty Kelly.  Kitty Kelly's accurate.  She usually writes accurate books.  What are some of the other books she wrote, Jimmy?  Do you know offhand?  She wrote about Liz Taylor.  I read a list of who she wrote about, and I can't remember, but she's written quite a few.  She's got some cred in the business, right?  Yes, she does.  Yeah, she usually tells the truth.  And now she's got this big Oprah book, and because Oprah's so powerful, no one is going to interview Kitty Kelly about this book.  Well, Letterman won't have her on, but again, maybe Letterman doesn't like her anyway. 
[01:07:30]  I don't know.  And then Rachel Ray said no.  Again, I can understand that because it's fucking Oprah's company.  So, you know, you can't piss on Oprah if you're Oprah's company.  But Larry King, I find to be very aggravating because to me this is like exactly the type of thing he would be covering, asking questions.  She's the most powerful celebrity in the world.  And, you know, she's kind of made a living, you know, asking other people to expose themselves and exposing things.  And she's great at it.  But her question made me cry. 
[01:08:00]  But, you know, if you're going to do that, hopefully we'll operate with some level of honesty because you're leaving yourself open to be very criticized.  Right.  You know, again, where Tiger is a golfer.  He doesn't say, hey, this is how you should live your life.  Or this is a guy who hits a ball for a living.  So I don't know.  But apparently Oprah is not happy with this book.  Well, why would she be?  And, you know.  Got this fucking nosy fucking little.  She's a busybody.  A busybody. 
[01:08:30]  It's even better.  Yeah.  Just getting into her life, talking to everyone that she used to know.  But there's allegations of lesbian flings, prostitution, and abuse.  And apparently she's on the outs with her stepfather.  And the big mystery is who her real father is.  Oh, yeah.  And no one would tell her.  I don't know why she doesn't know.  But I think Kitty Kelly.  No, someone told Kitty Kelly.  Right.  She doesn't know.  Okay.  Someone told Kitty Kelly because I watch some of those fucking gossip shows at night. 
[01:09:00]  Because I get enraged by watching The Insider and such.  Because it's just a joke, these programs.  It's unbelievable how bad they are.  Because they're like, you know, leave Oprah alone.  Leave her alone.  That's my girl.  And then all of a sudden they have this whole thing about the father.  It's like, really, you're reporting.  You're just as bad as everybody else that you're trashing for talking about the Oprah book.  Yeah, of course.  It was bizarre.  Actually, there's a clip I want to play for you guys later, maybe, if you care. 
[01:09:30]  But Kitty Kelly in this interview said that, with Matt Lauer, I think?  With Matt Lauer, that an aunt, some aunt down south, told Kitty Kelly who Oprah's real father is.  But she left it out of the book.  Because she wants Oprah to find out for herself.  Well, she was told with the condition that she don't print it.  I think she was told with a certain condition.  So she accepted it.  So why would you tell her that?  Maybe just to let her know who could tell her.  I don't know.  I don't know what her motive is.  Just to promote her own book.  Probably just to promote her own book. 
[01:10:00]  Right, right.  But this is what some of the allegations are.  I don't know how true they are.  The book says, Winfrey concocted stories about sexual abuse she suffered as a child and grossly exaggerated the poverty she was brought up in.  And the book says that she went to great lengths to conceal her lesbian affairs, including hefty payoffs,  and publicly attached herself to Graham Stedman to appear more normal to her audience of housewives.  And the book says she lavished romantic gifts, including a diamond toe ring, on ABC talking at Diane Sawyer. 
[01:10:30]  I guess there's a...  There's a Diane Sawyer connection?  I guess so, yeah.  And there's also an allegation that she sold her body to her money.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What's the Diane Sawyer thing about?  What are they hinting at with that statement?  It was...  Hold on a second, buddy.  Was there some fucking box licking going on between those two?  She just bought her a fucking toe ring.  At one point, it says here, later, determined to become rich and famous, Winfrey was ready to change her story to her advantage, 
[01:11:00]  making sure she cultivated her images in every woman, the book alleges.  That meant that she had to quell rumors about her sexuality.  At one point, the rumors included steamy or seamy talk at ABC about a relationship between Winfrey and Sawyer.  I didn't hear this.  Employees there described giggly late-night phone calls with a series of lavish gifts from Winfrey,  including the sprays of orchids.  I'm sorry, orchids.  And a one-carat diamond toe ring. 
[01:11:30]  Despite the rumors, Kelly concludes Winfrey is asexual.  So again, I read a Times review on the book, too, and they said that it was kind of...  What she's basically doing is rehashing a lot of rumors and quoting a lot of rumors, but not getting anything really new.  So that's a criticism of the book, is that she's basically just went through a whole bunch of stuff,  and she interviewed allegedly over 800 people.  So this book doesn't have a lot of new stuff.  I don't know.  It doesn't seem to.  So, ah, fuck her and a stupid book, then. 
[01:12:00]  And it's like, you know, obviously people want to know about the friendship with Gayle King.  Personally, I could care less either way.  I mean, who gives a fuck?  You're Oprah.  Who cares what you do?  At this point, it's like, if she's straight, she's straight, or she's gay, who gives a shit?  Yeah, no one would care.  She's Oprah.  It's like, to me, she's above it.  She's above any of that stuff.  But Diane Sawyer goes that way.  I don't know.  I never heard that one.  I honestly don't know.  The hairdo wouldn't surprise me.  A little tanner boilish.  I kind of like it.  That'd be kind of hot, though.  What's with the prostitution thing?  That, I don't know.  That's been out there for a long time. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, that's been out there for a long time, when she was like a teenager or something.  This is what was said.  Her family said, again, this is from the book.  Her family says that her having to name roaches as pets is nonsense.  Who would name roaches?  She may not have been well off, but Oprah was relatively spoiled as a little girl, her cousin said.  Where Oprah got this nonsense about growing up in filth and roaches, I have no idea, said a relative, Catherine Carr Esters.  I've confronted her and asked, why do you tell such lies? 
[01:13:00]  Oprah told me, that's what people want to hear.  The truth is boring.  Now, look, again, I don't have a problem if she makes herself a little image, but she did kind of accurately destroy James Fry for that on her show, which she should have.  I mean, I think that, you know, she should have killed her for that.  Yeah, it was a bullshit book.  Yeah.  You know, she made an ass out of herself supporting this guy and saying it was the truth and it wasn't.  I made an ass of myself.  That's a great one.  No.  So, I don't know.  I kind of want to get the book, though, to read it. 
[01:13:30]  And then John Tesh, I guess, in the 70s.  Yeah.  They kind of went out, but it was a little too much to have an interracial relationship back then.  So, John Tesh, I guess, backed out of that one.  According to Tesh's ex, he broke things off because he couldn't deal with the stigma of being an interracial couple.  Yeah.  He said one night he looked down and saw his white body next to her black body and couldn't take it anymore.  He walked out in the middle of the night.  Wait, that's a real quote?  That's what his ex said, yeah.  White body against her black body.  And Tesh has, I think, confirmed that they did have a relationship. 
[01:14:00]  Wow.  She said they went on a date once, but they apparently did have a relationship.  Supposedly two dates, so.  No, we probably did date her.  And that was back in the old broke opera with the big 70s.  Imagine what that bush looked like.  Ugh, Brillo pad.  Big, giant fucking steel wool.  She's probably scrubbing her pots with that fucking bush.  Oh, John Tesh looked down at that and left.  She was so poor she couldn't afford Brillo pads, so she said, what the hell, I'll use my own bush.  Some of them pet named roaches just crawling around in there. 
[01:14:30]  Pet roaches.  Who fucking would believe that?  John Tesh is very white, too, so that must have looked pretty funny.  Like the Jungle Fever fucking poster with the hand holding.  Yeah.  It's usually how powerful Oprah is, though.  No one wants to touch this.  No one wants to touch her.  Yeah, no one wants to have her as a guest.  She can't fuck with Rupert Murdoch.  I don't care how powerful she is.  No, she can't fuck with Rupert Murdoch.  So, you know, Fox is doing it.  And, you know, Fox and Friends, I talked about it this morning.  Mm-hmm.  It's got to be nice to be Rupert and not give a shit about any celebrity in this country. 
[01:15:00]  But, yeah, like all these little talk shows and stuff, you'll never see her on any of those  because Oprah could just crush them.  Crush.  Yeah, but she can't crush Rupert or Fox.  No, no.  Definitely not.  Definitely not.  Oh, there you go.  There's the Spike Lee fucking Jungle Fever poster.  Yeah, look how white and black that is.  Jungle Fever poster.  It's upsetting.  Isn't that a great poster, though?  It's upsetting.  The movie was decent, but I thought Samuel Jackson absolutely stole it and Halle Berry 
[01:15:30]  as the couple.  I liked Frank Vincent's scene.  Tremendous.  That was fantastic.  Dude, Frank Vincent was fucking great in Jungle Fever.  It was fantastic.  Oh, boy, did she come home to a doozy.  Do we have any of that audio, Frank Vincent?  Boy, was he not.  He was not happy.  He wasn't taking it, huh?  He wasn't pleased with her choice of gentleman.  And he allowed the entire neighborhood to know it.  Oh, exactly.  He yelled out the window.  That was great.  God damn, was Frank Vincent displeased.  He really was. 
[01:16:00]  He gave her a beating.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And what he was saying was just brutal.  She walked in the front door, and I think he just went, I'm nigga!  Yeah, yeah.  Like, her coat was still on.  She had a bag of groceries with a little French bread sticking out of the top.  He didn't say, look, the rumor is, you've been dating a black guy.  Word on the street has it, no, he went right to town.  Someone told him, and boy, what a good source that must have been. 
[01:16:30]  And I think the son, one of the sons was John Turturro, who was great.  And the other one was, what's his name, from The Sopranos.  Was it Imperioli?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Michael Imperioli.  I was watching, like I woke up from a nap.  Woken up.  You were woken up.  I was woken up.  I woke up from a nap, and Sopranos was on A&E.  I guess they're playing it.  And it was one of the mid of the, middle of the show, shows run episodes. 
[01:17:00]  So it was kind of cool to watch.  There was some good shit going on.  But to watch them just not curse is really, you realize how much cursing they did on that show.  Freaking.  A lot of freaking.  Hey, tell that freaking guy.  What are you showing the fucking show for?  What are you doing?  And it's A&E, so it's not even under FCC guidelines. 
[01:17:30]  Just play the fucking show.  Seems.  You just grab it.  Like I said, I could have just gone and get a DVD and popped it in, but it was one of those.  What am I going to know?  Yeah.  I have a Sopranos film festival from the middle, and you know how shitty it ends.  So I think that ruins the, like, Sopranos box set thing.  Like, if you wanted to spend a whole fucking week just watching Sopranos beginning to end or whatever,  you just know how shitty it ends, so you, like, the whole lead-up to it sucks. 
[01:18:00]  There are some great fucking episodes.  Well, besides the ending, all the storylines that they just dropped.  Yeah.  That was so fucking frustrating for me.  I understand you can't tie up everything, but they dropped a lot of great storylines.  They said almost like it never happened.  Yeah, it didn't happen.  I'm expecting that from Lost, by the way.  Well, I told you.  Completely expecting.  What did I say day one of this season?  That you guys are going to get your journey ending.  You're going to get your stupid journey ending. 
[01:18:30]  They're just trying to figure out which journey song to use for you.  Love it, touch and squeeze in.  Fucking stinks.  Fucking every new character is worthless.  There's no backstory, and they're fucking terrible actors.  Whoever, that Zoe is atrocious.  How did they cast her?  It's an embarrassingly bad show right now, and it's like the acting is terrible.  The dialogue fucking stinks.  Yeah.  Lazy writing.  It's like they're just, every explanation they're giving, 
[01:19:00]  I feel like they're just shoehorning.  Like, okay, check, check.  All right, we got that one.  How do we solve this question?  It is fucking horrendous.  All right, we got that.  Yeah, you're right, exactly.  I got to go back to The Sopranos, because this guy goes,  I'm sick of, I'd give you credit, but I don't see a name here.  I'm sick of people saying they didn't get The Sopranos ending.  He's dead.  I didn't say they can get it.  He's not dead.  First of all, I didn't say they can get it.  But that's how your life sucked.  And he's not dead.  It was left open for pure speculation. 
[01:19:30]  Well, I don't know, man, because I've been thinking about death.  And, you know, your life just ends, and you don't even know it ends.  Yeah.  You don't even, like, you don't even know.  He was just eating.  There was no.  So when the screen goes fucking just dark, that's how his life,  that's how you die.  No, because there's no, like, fade out.  The time was up on the show.  There's no fade out, though, in your life.  They had all these little details.  You're living, doing your thing, and next thing you know,  it's just fucking blank.  So I kind of like the fact that maybe this guy is right. 
[01:20:00]  He's totally wrong.  I don't know.  It was just an ending like life just goes on.  That's what I think.  Just goes on.  Because there was no menace.  They would have showed you something which indicated the guy was going to.  They would have showed you a face, a gun, something.  Well, they showed the guy going into the bathroom.  They show people looking a little suspicious.  Right.  Like any one of those guys could have stood up and shot him.  Dramatic non-moment of his daughter parking the car.  When did this show end?  Five years ago?  Yeah, I know, right?  Yeah.  And then he woke up with his wife,  and he realized that Newhart was just a dream. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  You know what?  He did something right, because we're still discussing the ending.  Years later.  That guy goes into the bathroom, and then this guy, you know,  black guy looking around.  Black guy.  They're all looking very suspicious.  And then Meadow's having a hard time parallel parking,  because she's a girl.  And he knows.  And they can't park.  Like, Tony's just eating.  Yeah.  Woo!  What?  AJ.  He ordered for the table. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, he ordered for the table.  He got an order for the table.  And then Meadow walks in.  A real man orders for the table.  And then, see, that's how your life would end.  Well, no, that was it.  That's how it ends.  That was Meadow coming in.  That was Meadow coming in.  That's what they wanted to think.  But you don't know.  Maybe he looked up like, oh, fuck, and he got shot, and boom,  it goes to black.  No, that is a life.  That was Meadow just walking in.  Life goes on.  Well, why would the fucking guy tell us?  Because he doesn't even know.  Just fucking tell us.  He left it open to interpretation.  But even if he doesn't know, go look. 
[01:21:30]  I just decided this would fuck.  I don't even know what it means.  Give us something.  Why don't you just end the show?  Like, for real.  Like, let us know how it happened.  Because he was trying to do something different.  I don't mind that.  Man, I'm not going to give people the ending.  Because you know what?  If people wanted him alive, then the people that wanted him dead wouldn't be happy, and  vice versa.  So I'm not going to give anyone an ending.  Man.  Wow, you're too cool.  Thanks for fucking up all of our years of watching.  It's my favorite bit on the show, by the way, is the man. 
[01:22:00]  They're just too cool.  I'm not going to have a radar moment.  Man.  Mash.  That was a great moment when radar, and they all hated Gary Berghoff, I heard, but when  he left the show, the Hawkeye saluted him from the surgery.  That was great.  Did he salute with his little fucking chewed up hand?  No, he was holding his little clipboard with that.  His clipboard, so he couldn't show that his fingers are all fucked up.  He nailed that clipboard with that hand.  A little thalidomide hand.  That was a great episode. 
[01:22:30]  It was a two-parter with radar left.  Yeah.  So he walked out.  They were all in surgery.  His party never happened.  Let's go to Tony and Savannah.  Tony.  They're sad.  Choppers.  Tony!  Yeah.  What's up?  All right.  If you go back to the episode with Baccalari and Tony in the boat, they're talking about  death.  Tony says, I believe when you go, it just fades to black.  And that's how the show ended.  So it was shot.  Yeah.  I think there was more of a death thing going on there than you're thinking.  It's a TV show, so nothing happened.  I'm with you there, Tony. 
[01:23:00]  I'm not.  Leave it open.  I'm not, because what would happen is if he wanted the guy dead, he wouldn't have just  showed a black guy looking at pastry, which had no connection to a mafia show, or a guy  going to take a shit.  They would have showed something much more ominous, and then it would have faded to black, and  people would have went, what happened?  Did he kill him, or did he not?  Then they would have raised that question, and it would have been believable.  But by putting no real menace there, I just watched it.  I don't buy that death thing at all.  The guy, sir, I just wish that you didn't call and say that.  But maybe it's kind of like The Wire. 
[01:23:30]  Remember when fucking Omar died, and we thought it was a huge fucking deal, and they're like,  eh, yeah, that guy, Omar died.  It was like no big deal to everybody else.  Remember that, Jimmy?  Yeah, but they did show you Omar.  By the way, the best fucking shooting ever.  But after all that, you're like, what, that's how he goes out in The Wire?  It was great.  At least it was great.  Dude, you were so not expecting it.  At least it was legit.  At least they gave you some kind of ending.  I'll take a pack of Newports, and he's dead.  And then he's dead.  And then they just talked about him like, oh, that guy, Omar. 
[01:24:00]  What was the line?  I forgot, but they...  Omar.  Oh, yeah, Omar, yeah.  Omar, huh?  But to us watching the show, Omar was everything.  And then they zip him up in the wrong body bag at the end, and then the coroner looks,  he goes, ah, like, what a little screw up with the name tags.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that, like, he was so important to us, but to the coroner, he was just one more dead fucking drug dealer.  He wasn't important to anyone else except...  Man, nothing.  Except very important to us, the viewers.  And when I'm shooting today, I'll discuss that with my new friend, Dominic.  I saw that.  Who was...  Fucking Jimmy killed me.  Herc on the wire.  Jimmy killed me the other day. 
[01:24:30]  He sends me a picture of him and...  What's his name?  Dominic Lombardozzi.  Dominic is his real name?  Yeah.  Herc.  From the wire.  The cop.  And I'm like, god damn, that's fucking cool.  Yeah, we're doing all our scenes together, which is great.  For the HBO show?  Yeah, a couple of men just doing some acting.  You know, a couple of trained actors.  That's it.  That's nice.  Ah, Mr. Faber-Sham.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  You're good.  That's what they tell me.  You know, why don't we do this?  Vosk got here early.  Oh, good.  Why don't we throw him a bone and get him in here? 
[01:25:00]  So we'll do a quick break.  Get Vosk in here.  He's promoting Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  Bananas.  That's one of my favorite clubs, by the way.  You like the Bananas?  I love Bananas Poughkeepsie.  You know, I don't think I've ever been there.  The Poughkeepsie, you don't think it'd be a good gig because it's in a hotel, like a little  shitty hotel on Route 9 in Poughkeepsie.  But that club, there's two clubs.  There's the comedy club and there's like the big performance downstairs, the ballroom  downstairs where they do comedy.  Oh, the ballroom.  And it's great, man. 
[01:25:30]  I love that fucking, for real, I love that fucking gig.  Blade shaped like a banana.  Bananas.  Bananas.  Why do they got to call clubs that?  Bananas?  Yeah.  Where the song is, hey, we have no bananas.  You hear that for six months after you leave that club.  I wake up screaming in the middle of the night for that fucking theme song.  That is awful.  I haven't done the club in a long time.  I do the downstairs, but Rich Pro does the club.  Yeah, of course. 
[01:26:00]  Rich just does the club.  I don't know where he does shorts the club.  Poor Rich.  All right, we'll talk to Rich Voss next.  We got a nice little production piece the boys put together.

It leads to a little discussion about some mundane fucking...  Fact.  Dumb factoid.  We know that.  We know it's mundane.  Did you just get a kiss from Jim Norton?  A kiss?  A kiss?  A kiss, Rich.  What did you get?  That's the quickest I've ever came.  I gave Voss a little kiss on the back of the neck.  Unbelievable. 
[01:29:30]  What's up, Rich?  I'm glad that you guys, I was in the green room, and I heard you say...  Do you like our green room?  It's nice.  I heard you guys say, hey, we got Voss here.  Let's get him in early and throw him a bone.  Well, thank you.  I can't tell you after 40 fucking thousand times in here that I get to come in 15 minutes early.  It's a big bone.  That should get one and a half more people into my shitty fucking show this weekend.  Slow down a little bit.  That really is true.  Slow down.  It's 12 minutes early. 
[01:30:00]  It's 12 minutes early.  Not 15.  It's more like some cartilage.  Dude, you should be selling out everywhere, Rich.  I am.  My fucking act.  It's...  You know, sell.  I know what you meant.  Artistically.  What's that?  I know what you meant, yes.  Let's ask Rich this.  What's on your mind today, Rich?  What's on your radar?  What's on your radar?  We were talking about Oprah.  We were talking about...  There's not much going on in the news today.  But what's on your radar today? 
[01:30:30]  Okay, here's the real deal.  And I'm not coming in like, you know, it's so hacky when people go...  Like, you hear comments go, oh, women this, guys this, women.  But last night, I really figured out that women are really fucking crazy.  I mean, like, Saturday, I was driving home from my gig, and I'm talking to Bonnie on the  phone.  I go, what are you doing?  She goes, I'm watching a movie you rented.  Okay.  So I call her back.  She goes, eh, it's kind of boring.  I cut it off.  I'm going to go to bed.  She didn't like Buy Curious? 
[01:31:00]  I didn't say my documentary.  I said that movie.  So she goes, listen, it's boring.  I turn off.  I'm going to bed.  I'll see you when we get home.  So that was Saturday night.  So the movie was due yesterday, Monday.  Due?  Due.  Due back.  Where do you get it?  From where?  Blockbuster.  You're the last person going to Blockbuster.  I knew he wouldn't make it through the story before he said something stupid. 
[01:31:30]  Blockbuster?  Yeah.  And when I get there, they go, he's here.  He's the last guy.  You do realize most Blockbusters, they're pretty much just giving away their inventory.  So what are you saying?  How else can you get it?  How else?  You found the last Blockbuster that's still doing business.  How much is it to rent?  Well, it's like five, six, almost six bucks.  And you have it for five days.  But if it's a day late, if it's over, if it's a day late, it's a dollar a day.  If it's a day late, they go, ah, just keep it.  A dollar a day. 
[01:32:00]  A dollar a day.  You can buy it, Rich.  What year is this?  Buy it on iTunes.  Buy a movie on iTunes?  How are you going to?  Hold on.  Exactly.  Sir, come on my chin.  I fucking, what do you mean on iTunes?  What do you mean I watch it on my iPhone?  I don't have an Apple at home.  Oh my God.  How old are you?  You don't have an Apple.  What do you eat?  Fucking horse teeth.  Sugar juice.  Rich, you do this to yourself.  I don't do anything.  You rented a movie from Blockbuster.  I don't know anyone that's been to Blockbuster in years. 
[01:32:30]  I don't remember the last time I heard someone say I rented a movie at Blockbuster.  Well, aren't you guys glad you threw me a bone so you got to story this early?  Thank God.  Here's what I'm saying.  I used to have the thing on my TV where-  What thing?  The little thing.  Rabbit ears?  No, where you can get, where you can download shit from, you know, like movies on TV.  You know, how you download them.  What the fuck?  Don't look at me for help.  I'm enjoying this.  Wow.  Wait, you know what I'm saying? 
[01:33:00]  You're in quicksand.  You know, when you get-  This is like talking to someone from the past.  I love this.  Wait a second.  It is.  It's rules, man.  He came in the time machine to our time.  It's like-  We have to explain the future to him.  What do you-  You know, when you-  Okay, talking to Rich is like talking to somebody on a bad cell phone connection.  No, I'm not trying to be funny.  I'm trying to be-  I know, but when you-  Okay, when you have TiVo, when you have TiVo-  TiVo?  Listen, even TiVo is kind of outdated.  You could do it through the phone line, or you could do it through the satellite.  The phone line? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, you could do it through dial-up, or you could do it-  Dial-up?  Yeah, that's dial-up.  Oh, what do you know?  The phone line.  Yeah.  The phone line, or you could do it-  Is this hot tub fucking time machine?  We're fucking living hot tub time machine right now.  You could do it through the phone, or you could do it through, you know, the air, satellite.  Wi-Fi?  Wi-Fi, whatever.  So I had the fucking Wi-Fi.  No, no, no, no, it wasn't Wi-Fi.  It's whatever, you know.  That's way too advanced for you.  It's what?  It's the fucking, you know, the-  The what, Rich?  Digital, where you could fucking get a- 
[01:34:00]  On the cable.  Cable.  Cable.  Cable, good.  Like your internet access, you know, where you get the fucking-  Right.  Right.  Okay, so I had that.  But what is it called?  Danny doesn't know.  Danny knows tech shit.  No, what are you talking about?  What was this gadget?  Are you talking about, like, just on-demand channels?  No, no.  Netflix?  All right, slow down.  Start with the real basics.  Would Tevo ever have something?  You have cable?  I have Tevo.  Do you have basic cable?  I have basic cable.  You have basic cable?  Basic cable.  Do you have HBO?  No.  Do you have the movie channels?  No.  Why would you get those?  Why wouldn't you?  Because I buy everything. 
[01:34:30]  I like buying box sets.  Okay?  Because the only box I'm getting in my house is-  I want to apologize to you, Rich, for not getting you in earlier.  No, I'm trying to fucking-  Like, 601.  No.  This is always classic.  No, it's not classic.  Can you fucking listen so I can go to you try to figure this out?  Yeah, you got basic cable.  Rare cable.  No HBO.  No.  But you can download movies through the Wi-Fi satellite.  Not anymore, because it just fucked up after that whole transition.  What is this service where you download movies? 
[01:35:00]  It's just, you know, you just buy them on Netflix or something, or whatever, on TiVo.  Not Netflix.  Leota gave a smoother explanation in fucking Goodfellas.  I'm going to tell the story.  You didn't let me finish the story, but anyhow.  Okay, here we go.  But we don't want to hear the rest of the story yet, because we're really trying to figure  out how you're getting your movies at home with just basic cable.  Through Blockbuster.  I'm not getting it anymore with basic cable.  We had TiVo.  Okay, then you get the thing that goes through your fucking internet, your wireless internet.  Yeah.  What's that called? 
[01:35:30]  Huh?  What's that called?  The Thing.  The Thing.  I don't know what the fuck it's called.  It's called, you know.  Web TV, someone is saying.  No, I used to have that in the beginning, when Web TV came out.  Danny, do you have any idea?  No.  I'm trying real hard.  Can you get a new movie, a newer movie?  No, it wouldn't be a sling box.  No, it's not a new.  And you download movies.  You go, like, if you look at TiVo, it goes, uh, to buy a movie, you know, when you want  to buy a movie at TiVo.  Oh, my God, Rich, I swear to God, you do it to yourself. 
[01:36:00]  So you could watch a movie through TiVo.  You could have rented a movie through TiVo.  I don't think he's talking about TiVo, though.  Yeah, we got TiVo.  So you could rent a movie.  You get the, what do you call, what the fuck do you call those things where college  diplomas?  I was like, you know, fucking broadband or whatever.  Whatever.  No.  That would be hard.  No, wait, hold on.  Just throw in tech terms out there, hoping that one of them will stick.  I can't remember what it's called. 
[01:36:30]  You've said broadband, Wi-Fi.  It goes through.  Usually people can come up with the answer within a second.  That's why I don't want to move on from this, because I really am fascinated with what I  know.  Because what I'm trying to do is, because we weren't getting the power upstairs, so I  had to get another router and put it halfway from the first router to the second router.  All right, a little wireless, right?  So it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Okay.  That you get at fucking like Best Buy for 70 bucks, and you hook it to your shit. 
[01:37:00]  You hook it up, okay?  And it goes through the wireless connection, and you can download shit, okay?  But what's the service called?  What's the service called?  It doesn't matter, because it's not working.  You can rent movies off Xbox.  You can rent movies off the PS3.  We don't have Xbox.  You could do a little Netflix from your TV.  Yeah, but CDs.  So what is this service where you're downloading movies?  Through TiVo.  And you could do it.  You could do it.  You could do it.  You don't even have to be home.  You could program your stuff. 
[01:37:30]  Anyone on Paltalk got the answer?  No one's really saying anything like that.  Let me see.  Pay-per-view?  No.  Well, that would be obvious.  Pay-per-view?  No, because you can't get the newer movies on this.  It's kind of, there's never new ones.  It's older stuff.  TiVo.  I'm not a movie rental.  TiVo.  Holy shit.  Was that you?  You got that right.  Put that on mic next time.  Better than what's coming out of your mouth. 
[01:38:00]  Is that, is your, do you have a tattoo ring?  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you guys get that done at Woodstock?  That's a hippie thing.  Oh.  Bad damn hippie.  So why don't you explain where you got your movie?  Blockbuster.  No.  A TiVo plug-in to manage your online movie rental.  So you're getting your movies from TiVo.  Amazon Unbox.  Yeah, yeah, Amazon.  Amazon Unbox.  Bingo.  What is that? 
[01:38:30]  We have a winner.  I've never heard of it.  No, we don't.  Yes, yeah, because I got it through Amazon.  I just put in TiVo movie rental.  So it's Amazon Unbox.  You got it.  All right.  I never heard of it.  Who would have remembered that?  That was exhausting for everybody.  You.  Someone go get some towels for everybody.  We got a towel off.  Here's the thing.  But I mean, that's not working now because I'm not getting that towel.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Look.  We're going to fucking guide you through this whole thing.  Maybe get somebody to come over and fix it.  There it is.  Okay.  So what's an Amazon Unbox?  And I never heard of this. 
[01:39:00]  It's Amazon Unbox.  U-N-B-O-X.  U-N Unbox?  Yeah.  So it's got, you know, movies.  It looks like a TiVo kind of setup.  Okay.  I mean, yeah, TiVo.  A Netflix kind of setup.  Okay.  Yeah.  But there's no new movies.  Yeah, apparently not.  Okay.  I'm looking at, you know.  So that's how you got your movies.  Mm-hmm.  And then you had to go back to Blockbuster.  Yeah.  You're basically the last customer at Blockbuster.  You know that.  The store's always there.  I don't even think there's a Blockbuster in Manhattan anymore.  I know.  The one in my neighborhood closed down years ago. 
[01:39:30]  I haven't seen one.  Well, yeah, because, I mean, the only ones that are left are two.  Typically in lesser neighborhoods.  Ah, what do you get?  VHS?  Right.  Jesus.  It went from fucking horrible to stupid.  Blockbuster.  That's when you walked in.  I know.  Now he's coming back with the rubber glue shit.  No, it's okay.  I called our show horrible.  That's right.  I just called you stupid.  That's right.  That's right.  It worked out.  Yeah, it did work out. 
[01:40:00]  Block.  What I'm saying.  What happens to you?  Because I got a lot of things going through my head.  I can't get them all out at once.  I can't get them all out at once.  Are you okay?  You're not having a stroke or anything.  I like the bunch of letters like fucking alphabet soup.  So, Rich, what are you saying?  I don't know what you're saying.  So, we went to Blockbuster.  And you were saying what, you know, I'm just saying how fucking fucked up women are that  they would think this way.  Okay.  So, I'm driving home Saturday night.  How's the movie?  And it's boring.  I'm going to go to bed. 
[01:40:30]  I'm not watching it.  So, I have to return it by Monday.  Of course.  And every time.  The worst is, the fucking worst is when you have a movie that you don't even watch.  And then you've got to even pay like an extra $8 or $7.  Because you didn't bring it back.  Because you didn't bring it back.  I remember that from 1993.  Yeah.  Yeah.  True.  It's the worst.  What year for real in?  Blockbuster?  Think.  I was using Blockbuster in Massachusetts when we were there.  And then right when we came back to New York.  So, late 90s. 
[01:41:00]  So, we've been out of the Blockbuster thing for almost 10 years, Rich.  That long?  Yeah.  Blockbuster sucks.  Buy the movie.  It's the same price.  That's about right.  You can buy the movie for fucking $10.  At this point, yeah.  You can't buy a movie for $25 an hour.  I mean, I buy movies.  No, a movie's $25.  When they come out.  When they come out.  There's no movies really for $25 anymore.  You can buy just the crap.  What movie did you rent?  What movie was it?  I don't fucking even remember.  Like some broad or was up for an Oscar or some fucking movie.  I didn't even watch it.  You don't even know the name? 
[01:41:30]  No.  Why'd you bring this up then?  Because it's not a good story.  It's just a story about women.  How crazy they are.  All right.  Let's get back to that.  You asked me.  See, it would have been good if I just got through the story.  You would have agreed.  Yeah, they're fucking out of their minds.  But now it turned into this whole thing about, you know, Blockbuster and my, you know, cable and all that shit.  No one gives a fuck back in the real world about, you know, what I'm saying.  They care about.  What they care about is women and relationships.  And, okay, I'm not here, like, pretending. 
[01:42:00]  I'm not Patrice who pretends he knows about women.  He just started fucking them like a week ago.  I've been fucking them forever.  Or, okay, you know, he read a book or two on it or whatever.  No, he bought a hat.  Quite an insight, I think.  Huh?  I think Patrice has quite an insight on women and relationships.  Good.  Okay.  Good.  Good.  Yeah, and a suitcase full of.  So you don't know what movie it was, but Bonnie, your wife.  What's a movie that's out now? 
[01:42:30]  Bonnie, your wife, was watching this movie.  Yeah.  Now, tell me.  The one with the football there and the blind side.  No, no.  We don't watch that.  That's the same old story.  Precious, was it with a dame?  No, we already saw that.  They're laying down on the box.  The box is a girl and a guy laying down.  I just want to hug Rich Voss.  I just want to hug him.  They're laying down on the box.  They're laying down.  Okay.  Who is they?  Can you even help with the they? 
[01:43:00]  Wait, wait.  You think we can figure out what movie it is by getting clues from Rich Voss?  Let's try to do this.  Is it new news?  Yes.  Okay.  Here's the clue.  But what's new to Rich Voss?  Okay.  She was up for an Oscar.  The broadest.  This year?  Yeah.  And they're laying down on the box.  Yeah.  You think we can figure out this movie?  I think she's on his chest or he's on her chest.  I know what the movie is.  And he's, he, he, he, you recognize him from other movies.  All right.  That's our second clue, Ed.  You recognize him.  We're going to recognize him from other movies and it's a broad laying. 
[01:43:30]  It's not the Alec Baldwin, Meryl Streep movie.  Oh, Meryl Streep.  No, no.  I would know those two.  I love Meryl Streep.  She's all right.  You love Meryl Streep.  500 Days of Summer?  No.  We turned that off in the middle.  Take the wig?  I liked 500 Days of Summer.  It was different.  A little artsy film.  Most people are, all right, so it's a guy and a girl.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah.  I see it.  An education.  Winner.  That stunk.  Did it?  Yes.  I wouldn't watch it because, you know, goes against everything I believe in. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, exactly.  You should have gotten one, not watched the movie.  I just said the job.  Yes, I know.  I just put it in a better format.  He thought it was about a guy named Edward Ucation.  So, yes.  Yes, folks.  So, you see?  So, Bonnie was watching an education.  Okay, so she's watching.  Okay.  Just how crazy.  He said, I'm going to bed.  You know, it's boring.  So, okay, I have to return it Monday or else it's late. 
[01:44:30]  So, I go, I'm going to the video store.  I'm returning the movie.  Do you want, you know, maybe I can know.  I have to go return some videotapes.  I'm going to return the beta.  I'm going to the.  Yeah.  So, I get back home last night.  I, you know, I drop it off.  I call from the video store.  There's no good movies.  It's blockbuster.  You know, I'm just going to go.  You're the guy on the cell phone still at blockbuster.  What do you think we should get, sweetie?  I'm in new releases.  So, I get home.  I'm home an hour. 
[01:45:00]  I'm sitting at my desk on the computer.  And she says, where's the movie?  I go, I returned it.  She goes, well, what the fuck you do that?  I didn't finish it.  Why will you return?  I go, because it would have been late for, you know, I don't want to pay, keep paying for it.  She goes, oh, good.  So, now I got to go back and get it and to watch 25 minutes.  I got to pay another $5 instead of being like, I go, are you out of your fucking mind?  You said you didn't like the movie.  It was boring.  I told her I was returning. 
[01:45:30]  She goes, but I didn't think you were really going to do it.  Like, it was a threat?  It wasn't a threat.  You were making an idle threat that you were taking the movie back?  She goes, I didn't think you, at first, I didn't think you knew how to take the movie out of the VCR.  Well, she's.  Or DVD player, whatever it is.  DVD, VCR.  DVD.  She goes, I didn't think you knew how to take it out.  And I didn't think you would really do it.  It's not like I said.  Why did you need to take it back so bad?  Oh, he's afraid of those late fees. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, no.  I just want to take a ride.  Yeah, you just want to get out of the house.  Yeah, that's my excuse.  Why don't you just go to BitTorrent or something like that?  Go to a torrent.  Oh, my God.  Why did you say BitTorrent?  And then you download the movie, you burn it to a disc, and then you watch it on TV.  You can do it.  How much does that cost?  Oh, my God.  I want to start doing that kind of shit, but isn't it illegal?  I don't want to.  It's illegal.  So is drug use.  You did that for years?  Yeah, really.  Lighten up. 
[01:46:30]  No one's going to care if you download an education and give it a try.  Okay, if you download it and then you burn it.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  You've got to erase it because it'll eat up a lot of room on your computer.  Oh, my God.  Tech talk with Rich Voss.  This is amazing.  This is amazing.  You are.  I'm just saying, erase it.  Erase it because it'll take up a lot of space. 
[01:47:00]  Okay.  You've got to erase it.  You've got to hold up your hard drive and take a big pink eraser.  So where do you go to?  I mean, like, I don't want to go to the site and then you've got to do this, that, all this shit.  I just want to get to the site and go, do you want to download this?  Click.  Is it that easy?  Well, it's a program you've got to download first, a torrent.  Well, the program is going to eat up a lot of space probably, right?  What kind of computer do you have?  A 486?  Where are you?  Yeah, what's your computer?  Is it new?  How old is your computer?  IBM.  What kind of computer you got, Rich?  I got, like, four at the house. 
[01:47:30]  One for, uh...  But we don't even go online with.  Are they new?  Why aren't you?  What?  The one that we go online?  Because that's what we download for the documentary, and I don't want to go online and take a chance  if they get infected or anything, you know what I mean?  So that, the new one, we don't go online at all with it.  The other ones, and we have, like, three other ones.  Who doesn't go online with their computer?  With their new computer.  I just told you I don't.  Very afraid.  Because it's used for just, for making a movie.  If you're making a movie, you don't want to take that chance of fucking damaging all the stuff. 
[01:48:00]  Uh-huh.  So now your online computers, how old are they?  Like, how old's your newest one?  Uh, the newest one's probably about three years old.  Oh, Jesus.  I might have to dump it.  Yeah, I think you need to know.  I already have two, huh?  What's the problem with the computer?  You have to dump it.  The X and Z doesn't work, so I have to copy and paste every time I use X or Z.  I have to copy and paste.  Do you really?  You've got to find an X somewhere. 
[01:48:30]  I've got to go to Word.  I've got to go to Word.  Spell.  Spell extra.  I spell extra wrong.  So what do you have to?  I pop it down.  So according to your computer, you're an Eero.  And X comes up so much more than Z.  Oh, wow.  So I've got to copy and paste that.  That doesn't work.  That doesn't work.  And the shift on the left-hand side doesn't work, so I've got to do it right. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, my God.  Is that great?  Yeah, the keyboard, it sounds like, is broken.  Yeah, that's an easy fix.  No, that's just that corner.  That's where the coffee spills.  They get a new keyboard.  It's 20 bucks.  The keyboard is nothing.  Yeah, that's an easy fix.  Oh, you think it's just a keyboard?  Oh, fuck.  No, no, no, you fucking idiots.  It's on a laptop.  Please don't call us fucking idiots.  It's on a laptop.  He said laptop.  He said say laptop.  It's on a laptop.  It's on a laptop.  Then you'd have to get a whole new keyboard in the laptop.  Yeah, it's not that bad. 
[01:49:30]  How much do you think a whole new keyboard is?  It depends what kind of laptop.  You're probably looking at like 30 bucks.  That's it?  No, because every time I bring my computer in, it costs 100 bucks for the dude to fuck around with it.  Let's see if they navigate to all that gay porn.  Just bailing him out for this illegal pornography.  Rich, you just stumbled into a radio show.  I don't want to lose this call.  Josh in D.C.  Josh.  What's up, guys?  Josh, you're a fucking retard, man.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, really?  Yeah, really?  Want to play me in golf, faggot?  You and Laszlo need to have a show on Saturday night.  I completely agree. 
[01:50:00]  What's that?  Would you do a fucking tech show with Laszlo?  Laszlo would do this in a second.  Would you do this?  Laszlo is like the fucking opposite of you.  It would be a great show.  Danny, can we book that?  Laszlo and fucking Rich Voss doing a...  A technophile and a pedophile.  Yeah, I would do it.  A zero file.  I would do a tech show.  I got a Saturday in May.  All right.  Well, then Saturday in May, you're going to do a fucking show with Laszlo.  We got to work that out.  That would be one for the ages.  Wow.  So you don't have an X and a Z that works. 
[01:50:30]  And a left shift.  And a left shift.  And a left shift.  And all you have to do is get a new keyboard, which isn't that much money.  And you don't know how much...  Who's going to install it?  ...memory you have.  I mean, not in your head.  In your computer, how much RAM you have, and your hard drive space.  Anything like that?  Oh, it's running low.  It's so slow, this computer.  It's fucking...  It's unbelievable.  Now, you do have a cable modem, not dial-up, right? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, I got a fucking...  I got a fucking...  What is it?  You know, the...  Through the...  What is...  What is...  What is...  Mean?  Just...  Through the air?  All over the house.  Through the air?  Yeah.  I got it.  You know, it's the...  It's like a guy on heroin.  That's amazing.  You're hysterical, man.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I got it.  I got it.  Yeah, you got it. 
[01:51:30]  It goes through your cable and not your telephone.  I got the second fucking router doing nothing, but they're fucking nice lights, man.  You don't...  It's...  You know, if you put a router...  Blinky, blinky, blinky.  You put it halfway in your house, you know, like I put it in my living room so it shoots  some more power upstairs.  Right, right, right.  You got to get the little antenna closer to where you're using your laptop.  But nothing's happening upstairs.  But you don't have any computers hardwired in with like a Cat 5 cable?  What the fuck?  Do I have any computers what?  Hardwired in with a Cat 5 cable. 
[01:52:00]  Hot-wired into where?  No, hardwired in.  Hardwired into where?  Into your computer.  No, for what?  Do I got what?  They're all wireless?  See, because you get faster uploads and downloads when it's hardwired in with a Cat 5 or a Cat 6  than you would have wireless connection.  But where do you fucking wire it into?  The router.  The back of the router.  You got it?  See, where your router...  The cable has a router, right?  Yeah.  And the router comes out and then goes into your wireless box. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You could run a wire from that to your computer and you'll get fast upload and download speeds.  Are you talking about the hot, the heavy, thick wire you're talking about?  Right.  The ones that look like a phone cable but fatter.  No, no.  I use that when I'm downloading videos from the camera to my other computer that's not online.  You're talking about a...  It's, you know, you can get a...  Wait, let them finish.  Yeah.  Yeah, they call them...  I think they call them hot wires. 
[01:53:00]  Hot wire.  Fire wire.  Fire wire.  There you go.  I'm not talking about a fire wire.  Hot wire.  Hot wires.  See, if you touch it...  Hot fire.  Same fucking thing.  Rich, I've never seen so many ha-ha-hahs come up.  Rich, I got...  Fire wire.  Fire wire.  I got great news for you.  Dow G from Connecticut.  I'll install it for Rich.  It takes only 10 minutes.  I'll hook you up if you wear your short shorts.  Oh, there you go.  To install it.  If you wear your short shorts, he'll come over and fix your shit for you.  No, I...  Now, fire wire is great for video.  Thank you, though. 
[01:53:30]  That is good.  The camera to your computer.  Fire wire.  Do you use fire wire 4 or 800?  Do I use 4 or 800?  Yeah.  Yeah, I...  You know what?  I went 600.  You compromised.  I compromised.  They asked me to 4 or 8.  I couldn't make any decisions.  So I went with 6.  Now, do you have a Cat 5 cable or Cat 6 running from your router to your computer that you  use online?  Or are all your computers wireless?  They're all wireless.  And one is dead.  See if you're... 
[01:54:00]  One is dead.  Why?  Not dead.  It's just...  It's because it just fucking...  If you want a faster connection, you hardwire in.  Are you doing a read?  With that.  No, I'm just saying.  Yeah, it should be.  I want to know why his laptop is dead.  Not my laptop.  My desktop.  Why is it dead?  It's not dead.  It's just fucking...  Hey, can I get a coffee with a milk and sweet and low?  Okay.  Googly.  Googly.  Easy with the insults.  Googly.  Those eyes, man.  That's Charlie.  That's Charlie.  He's a little heavy.  Charlie.  Every time he steps, his eyes bulge out. 
[01:54:30]  Charlie.  He's a little heavy?  Yes.  Have you ever tried to fucking cut out sugar?  It's almost fucking impossible.  Cut out what?  Sugar.  Sugar.  I did that with no slob.  Because then I would say, who do you think would have won?  Ray Robinson or Ray Leonard?  And people were like, who?  Oh.  Oh.  Boo.  Why are you trying to cut out sugar, Rich?  Speaking of sugar, my teeth hurt. 
[01:55:00]  Ouch.  Why are you cutting out sugar?  That's where you gain all your weight, man.  It's just to fuck you up.  Yeah, but show your abs.  You're looking good.  Yeah, I'm all right, bud.  Oh, God.  Your stomach looks like an ant.  I'm sitting here.  You got a thorax.  I know, I suck.  What is it?  Break a gate board, Park.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Horrible.  There you go, Rich.  Show those ass.  Yeah, fucking awful Paul Stanley chest hair.  You're on the cover of Destroyer with a fucking star on your eye.  Dope.  Yeah, sugar is pretty rough. 
[01:55:30]  Sugar, and I'm only doing one.  I'm crazy for Twizzlers.  I love Twizzlers.  How good fucking Twizzlers are.  But only the strawberry cherry Twizzlers fucking eat my ass.  The brown ones are good.  No.  If you take a whole brown one in your mouth.  I don't let them in my house.  They're not allowed in my neighborhood.  Make them clap when you leave the room so you know they're not stealing.  Wait, you're cutting out something else besides sugar?  Some bread, a little bread. 
[01:56:00]  I'm trying to cut down on bread.  Why?  Because I want to get fucking ripped, man.  I got to get ripped for the summer.  Bread and sugar are tough.  They are.  Well, I'll do.  What else is there to fucking eat?  I'll do, I'll do.  I have bread and sugar sandwiches.  Almonds.  When we were a kid, we used to have bread, butter, and sugar.  Yeah.  Bread, butter, and sugar sandwiches.  But you had margarine.  Yeah, margarine and sugar sandwiches.  Yeah.  I wonder bread.  But I'll eat one whole wheat, you know, the little round Arnold's ones now.  They're pretty fucking.  Yeah.  You know, they're only like 100 calories.  I'll eat one a day of that. 
[01:56:30]  You're like a girl.  I'm trying to cut down on sugar.  Are you counting calories?  No, I'm not counting calories.  Yes, you are.  You said 100 calories.  You can't.  You know what, uh, there were some other tech questions I needed to.  Yeah, yeah, let's go with this.  Oh, oh, Facebook.  Right, right.  Facebook.  I'm up to my limit of friends.  I went to Barnes & Noble.  I couldn't find it.  I'm up to my limit of friends, 5,000. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Now what?  I think somebody set up a fan page.  That's right.  Someone set a fan page up for me, too.  How do you send them over?  What do you do?  How do you get them to your fan page?  I don't know.  Send it over.  Bring it over.  Send it over.  Put an announcement on your thing to go to the fan page.  It's, it's, I don't even know where it's at.  I think some guy sent it up from, thank you, whoever you were for sending it up.  Oh, my God.  But I don't even know where the fuck it is.  No idea.  So you don't even know what the Facebook is.  I got an email from Nigeria.  I could make $10 million. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, Facebook's on.  PayPal.  PayPal emailed me and needed my social security number.  Apparently, the guy that set up your fan page posted the link on your wall.  Yeah.  Why?  How do you know that?  Because Travis just told me.  Oh, he's listening?  Thank you.  Yeah, that's my job.  And I'm also looking at your page.  It's right there.  Where is it?  What do you mean?  You go to your, you go to your Facebook page.  Yeah.  And there's going to be a link under, I set up a fan page for Rich. 
[01:58:00]  There's a link.  Yeah.  And you click on that.  And that's your fan page.  How do I get people to go there instead of sending me friend requests?  Wait, we should have.  Copy and paste the link.  We should have Rich do exactly what Travis said.  Not you, Danny.  Copy and paste the link.  Much like you do with X and Z on your computer.  But where am I?  That is hysterical, man.  That's amazing.  Copy paste, X and Z.  It's a pain in the ass.  Thank God it's X and Z, though.  And not like, you know, A, E, I, O, U.  That's not something I would thank God about.  I would thank God about good test results. 
[01:58:30]  That's true.  Okay, I'm not going to waste my thanking to God on that one.  On your keyboard.  Thank you, God.  Literal boss.  Right there it is, Rich.  Right there.  Okay, so it's right here.  So what are you saying?  What do I do?  Okay, so you know how when you want to tell people something,  you write it in the space that says write something?  That's probably how he emails people.  Yeah.  Okay, so you copy and paste that link.  Yeah.  And you say, hey, everyone.  How did you get to my Facebook without even going? 
[01:59:00]  Without even knowing the password,  which is not going to happen this time.  Without knowing the password or any of that shit.  You could visit your page.  Yeah, you can go to your own page.  He's just visiting.  He's just visiting.  He's not in there.  This is just me going to Rich.  How'd you read his email, though?  What?  What?  Okay, so this, I can't do it right now because I'm not at my own page.  Well, you could if you logged in.  Yeah, if I logged in.  Wait, let Rich do it, Danny.  Do you really think I'm logging in here?  No.  I can't do it.  You don't have to log in.  I guess you do.  No. 
[01:59:30]  You can write something.  Can't do this.  No, if he writes it right now, it'll be me posting on his wall.  Right.  All right.  So I need to log out, and then he needs to log in.  Okay, so I log in.  Okay, so I log in.  I find this shit right here.  Rich, let's walk you through it.  Okay, listen.  Log in.  I'm going to copy it right now, so all you'll have to do is paste.  That's good.  It's like a computer clinic, Rich Voss.  Have him log in to his own Facebook page.  That's what I'm going to do after I copy the link.  Well, make sure you don't fuck up with the stupid password again.  Yeah.  Now you log in.  All right.  Log in to your Facebook.  Does he have to say it out loud as he types it in? 
[02:00:00]  It's going to be very easy, because our X's and Z's work here.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He's covering his head up.  He's taking a picture in 1920.  Yeah, he's covered his head up with his hoodie.  I can't see the keyboard.  And the keyboard.  Meanwhile, we can see what he's typing on the keyboard.  Yeah, he put it over his head, so he can't see if we're watching.  That's how they get him to run through Central Park without being distracted when he's pulling  a fucking carriage.  And the best part about what he just did was that when you type in your password on the 
[02:00:30]  screen, which he was covering, it comes up as asterisk anyway.  Yeah, yeah.  You do know that, right?  Your password will be asterisk for everybody else.  You don't have to worry.  All right.  Now what?  Now the big password.  All right.  Oh, this is.  Just hit tab.  Tell Danny to look away.  I've got to look up my password for Facebook.  Oh, yeah.  You don't remember it?  I hate to forget passwords.  Me too.  All the time.  All right.  Danny's going to look.  Every one of my passwords is butterscotch. 
[02:01:00]  I write them down in code on my iPhone.  No one can see, Rich.  So I can figure it out.  Special codes.  All right.  Okay.  Did you guys figure that out?  There's some kind of hacker that just got it.  That's a long-ass password.  Oh, my God.  Please re-enter your password.  You fucked it up.  You fucked up your own password.  Oh, I gave the wrong one.  Yeah.  I'll wait when that happens.  Try again.  Don't worry about it.  Jesus Christ.  That's why he's trying to type and cover the keyboard at the same time. 
[02:01:30]  Those little teeny hands.  I know.  Look at him go.  Exactly.  Oh, that's it?  That's easy.  Yeah.  No, it's not.  That's so you.  It really is.  That's an easy one to figure out because it's too close to, like, you.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  It is.  It should be just an anonymous thing.  That has something to do with your life.  Oh, I got to really spell out speech impediment.  Hold on.  Should I stay logged in?  No. 
[02:02:00]  What?  It says keep me logged in.  Log in.  Okay, I'll log in.  Yeah, that would have been good.  I know.  All right, there he goes.  All right, you're logged in.  You're logged in, folks.  All right, now.  Yeah.  Now what did that?  39 friend request.  I don't know what to do with it.  Now you got to copy, paste.  Where is it to copy?  I lost it.  It's already copied.  Yeah, but don't.  No, I want him to copy it.  I'll copy.  I know how to copy and paste.  I've been doing it with X and Z for months.  Yeah.  All right, find that link.  What are you looking for?  I don't have my glasses.  What are you looking for? 
[02:02:30]  That link.  All right, where's the link?  The audience are copy and pasting lots of Zs right now.  Where's the link?  You're looking at your news feed.  It's becoming X subscribers.  What am I looking for?  I go to my homepage?  No.  What do I go to?  Home?  I'm at home.  Oh, hold on.  Look at him.  I'm looking for a link.  I think Julian P.  He is so computer illiterate.  On your own wall.  And book illiterate.  Yeah, just illiterate.  What are you saying? 
[02:03:00]  Do you work on your own Facebook page or does someone else do it for you, Rich?  Hold on.  No, Danny's helping.  How do I get to my wall?  Well, like, you know how...  Have you ever visited someone's page before?  Never.  I don't care about this stuff.  I don't care about this stuff.  Because it would be like the same thing.  He's freaking out over here.  Except you just go to your page.  Yeah.  Okay.  You're on your page.  Let's say you wanted to go to her page.  Do you post on your own Facebook?  I would click her face or her name right here.  Okay, so where do you think you would find yours?  Right here.  I clicked my name.  All right. 
[02:03:30]  You just clicked his name.  All right.  Oh.  Ah, there you go.  Now you can send a message out.  But you're trying to find a link to your fan page.  Oh, here it is.  Here it is.  All right, you found it.  All right, go ahead.  Copy and paste.  Okay.  Just like you would with the...  There we go.  Copy.  Get a good one.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right, guys.  Copy that.  You think I don't know what the fuck I'm doing?  All right.  Now what?  There he goes.  He pastes.  Now what do I do?  Shoot yourself. 
[02:04:00]  You don't know.  You got to explain what that is for everybody.  Yeah, you got to kind of...  Holy shit, Rich.  All right, so what I did, folks, is I set up...  No, you got to explain what it is.  On the...  You're not on mic.  Because everyone's just going to get a link and they don't know what it is.  Holy shit.  What am I typing?  People are going to say, you got to explain what that is.  He gets on mic and starts explaining.  Okay, folks.  What it is.  Type it in so when they see the link on your page, they know what it is.  Right.  Not listening to the show.  Because people aren't going to just click our links.  Holy shit.  Okay, here's what I'm putting in. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, put in something.  What do I put it?  Under or over it?  Right here?  It's like Scotty in that there.  In that Star Trek movie when he picked up the mouse and went, computer?  Dude, he doesn't know how.  Computer?  He doesn't know how to fucking explain that link.  Where am I putting the link?  Where am I typing the link?  Right there.  Right here?  Yeah.  No, that's under.  Hold on.  Here and I'll hit enter.  And then I'll go down.  There you go.  Okay.  Now put something like, you know, hey, click above link to get to blah, blah, blah.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey is what I eat every evening.  What am I saying? 
[02:05:00]  That I went out of room for friends?  Yeah.  Write whatever you want.  I don't know what to put.  I don't know.  How do you not know what to put?  It's your Facebook.  Go.  Explain the link and why you're doing this.  Explain that link.  Explain why you're doing it.  You're a writer.  Hey.  You wrote for the Oscars.  This.  This.  This.  Link.  L-I-N-K.  Uh-huh.  Capitalize that.  No.  This link.  This link.  Good.  You're a terrible typist.  I can't do it.  I don't know what to write.  Just write something. 
[02:05:30]  You don't know what to write.  What is it a link to, Rich?  What is the link to?  What is it a link to?  I know how to type, stupid.  Meet me here.  Here.  All right.  Do this.  Jim's going to help you out.  You're a fucking silly goose.  I am a faggot.  There you go.  There you go.  Jimmy just wiped out the link and put, I am a faggot.  All right.  Now you've got to start over, Rich.  No big deal.  I don't know how to cut it.  All right.  Copy, paste.  It's still copied.  You don't have to copy it again. 
[02:06:00]  You copy it.  You copy it.  Yeah.  Copy, paste it again.  It'll always be.  Once it's copied, it's...  It'll be there until the next...  No, no, no.  But I erased it.  All right.  It does it.  Paste.  Okay.  You got the link back up there.  So now you want to send this out to everybody on your Facebook.  What do I hit?  Share?  No.  No, you got to explain the link.  Don't just click on links.  Before all that shit was dropped down.  Eesh.  It's like marketing.  You got to give them a reason to click on that link.  Hit enter.  Now, yeah.  Tell them what the link is.  Yeah.  Tell them what that's about.  They're not going to click on a link.  They don't know what it is.  Yeah. 
[02:06:30]  Go ahead.  Explain what you're trying to do to everybody.  My fan page is a waste of...  My fan page.  Oh, period?  My fan page.  If this is my fan page, that's a sentence?  That's it.  What else do I need to let them know?  That's my fan page.  Come here.  Why don't you put...  What?  Like, click on the above link to get to my fan page. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  You got to make it very obvious what you're trying to do.  Say something like, due to the large number of friend requests, I have...  Oh, slow down.  Slow down.  Dude.  No, Ed.  Let him, yes.  Let him do it.  I just want to start off.  I got it.  All right.  Dude.  All right.  Now he's good.  All right.  Explain the link.  Dude.  Make a sound.  Yeah.  Overwhelming.  Abundance.  How do you spell abundance?  A-B-U.  That's a big one for you.  Hold on.  I got to look it up.  I'll spell it for you. 
[02:07:30]  No, you'll fuck it.  No, I won't.  A-B-U-N-D-A-N-C-A.  There it is.  Say it again.  Abundance.  A-B.  A-B.  What?  What did your sandwich come on?  Abundance.  Due to the over...  Abundance.  A-B-U-N-D-U-N-C-E.  That was very funny.  Due to the overabundance of friend requests. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Would there be an S on that?  No, it's requests.  No, it's singular.  Go.  Due to the abundance of friend requests.  Go ahead.  I am a retard.  Sorry to inform.  Why are you sorry?  You make it sound like a good thing.  Yeah, this is a good thing.  Due to the request.  No, you're right.  I shouldn't say I'm sorry.  Yeah, make it sound big.  Like, this is a good thing for you.  Okay, you're right. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  Bigger than life.  Go back.  Delete a few.  Due to the abundance of friend requests.  I am definitely sorry.  No, I don't want to put that.  I have started a fan page with unlimited friend access.  I have started.  Even though you didn't start. 
[02:09:00]  A fan page.  Please click.  Period.  He's sweating.  Click above.  Period.  I started a fan page.  I do the abundance of friend requests.  I have started a fan page.  A fan page.  Fan page.  Please click the above link.  Oh, why are you helping him?  Okay, hold on.  Why are you helping him?  I got it.  You still can't do it. 
[02:09:30]  Please.  All right, please.  Just click above link.  The eagle.  That's Landy's?  Yeah.  How do you spell eagle?  E-A-G-L-E.  No, I don't want to put that.  That's been used before.  Please click the above link.  You got to finish strong here. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, okay.  And I am selling a queen-size bed and frame.  Why are you selling?  Why are you?  I know that's real.  That's the sad part.  I know.  Why are you selling a queen-size bed and frame?  Because I want to buy a king. 
[02:10:30]  You want someone to buy your shitty old mattress and frame?  Oh, my God.  How do you know what my frame looks like?  Oh, shit.  That's going to be a whole thing.  Now there's going to have to be phone calls made after the show.  That was a joke, right?  You don't really know what the bed looks like, do you?  C-H-E-R.  And bed frame.  Yeah, that seems pretty good.  All right, now what?  Can't you change that big, long link into just text? 
[02:11:00]  Do they have that feature?  It does it automatically.  If you highlight it and then just over it.  So now what do I do?  Right like.  I don't know.  Is that it?  Am I set for life?  That's it.  Now you're there.  I think you posted it right above I am a faggot.  See?  Yeah, but see, that post will wear out when other posts come along, won't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It will wear out.  I mean, it will be gone.  Do I got to keep doing that?  Or what?  It will go down from your.  On your wall.  No, but it will stay your status.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, I see. 
[02:11:30]  You know what that means?  Okay, so now the friends that say, I want to be your friend, I can't accept them.  What do I do?  I write back and tell them.  Don't just look.  Go to my fan page.  Yeah.  Go to your.  Just delete it.  And then give them that link.  Yeah.  I got to give them the link?  Yeah.  How are they going to find the fan page?  It's right there.  It's right there.  It's right there.  There you are.  But I mean, the people that you're going to write back.  Wow.  What?  You should make it easy for the people that are writing you.  Go, okay, look, I can't accept you on this page, but my fan page, here's the link. 
[02:12:00]  I'll accept you there.  And then when I get a fan, say I put a thousand people on my fan page.  I don't even have Facebook and I know all this shit, Rich.  Say I put my.  You don't have to have anything because you're a celebrity.  You shouldn't do it.  You know what I mean?  You're a celebrity.  I'm semi.  He's not a celebrity.  I am.  I was recognized about seven times yesterday.  We're all about the same.  Okay.  What's that?  We're about the same. 
[02:12:30]  As a dope.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you for helping me do this.  Okay.  Say I go to my fan page, right?  Say I get a thousand people.  But you're not even controlling that fan page.  It's somebody else's, right?  Yeah.  Well, he set it up.  You don't have the login or anything.  Oh, shit.  So you just sent a lot of people to a place you don't have control of.  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  See, that's not good.  The guy in Australia started mine and then gave me access.  Hopefully the guy will give you all the.  What do you mean give me that to get in and out? 
[02:13:00]  Can you get in and out of your fan page?  No, he can't.  He's a fan of himself.  No, I mean, well, oh, fuck.  Rachel Maddow looks like fucking Ralph Hodge.  So maybe I should just erase all that because this guy.  Yeah, why don't you.  We should have him erase everything.  Because he doesn't have control of the fan site.  Really?  You should send them all there after you get control.  How do you erase that post?  That could never happen without help.  I need help.  You can erase that. 
[02:13:30]  I need help.  I need help.  I'm the first one to admit when I need help.  My neck is better.  It's getting better.  Have you ever gone to?  You want me to tell you the biggest waste in fucking life?  It's physical therapy.  Yeah?  Not at all.  What?  You think it's?  For what?  For what?  Let's talk about physical therapy after the break.  No way.  It's not a waste.  I'm telling you.  My brother thinks it's a waste.  Why?  What have you been doing?  Well, can we do it after the break?  Oh, yeah.  Because you know this is going to lead to another fucking 20 minutes.  All right.  There's no way there's leather repair things.  Oh, wait.  Hold on. 
[02:14:00]  Just let me get this out real quick.  Yeah, go ahead, Rich.  This weekend I'm in Poughkeepsie at fucking Bananas.  And April 29th and May 1st up in Boston at Motley's Comedy Club.  Boston.  There's a lot of O&A fans.  Come to the show.  I'm not bullshitting.  I'm at the top of my fucking game on stage.  Why are you doing a Wilbur?  Why am I doing a Wilbur?  Or aren't you?  Why?  Because there would be a reason for that.  Okay.  So come to Motley's in Boston.  April 30th, May 1st. 
[02:14:30]  And this week, Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  Anybody that sees Rich Voss is guaranteed to go home having a good time.  You know what, Rich?  And we don't question that ever.  I fucking...  We were talking about that yesterday.  Fucking Rich Voss on a fucking stage.  You kill on our show in a different way.  But on stage, you have complete fucking control of what's going on in that comedy club.  Rich Voss is hilarious.  After the break, we talk about...  What was it?  Physical therapy.  Yeah.  And we got to talk about Ant's big date that's going down tonight.  You don't know anything about that.  He's got a big date?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, he does.  We'll tell you about that next, too. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, shit.  Talking golf with Rich Voss.  I know the Masters is pretty much history at this point.  Fading away fast.  But what do you think of the Masters?  You're a big golf guy, Rich.  You know what I... 
[02:15:30]  What I watched was great.  What gets me are these...  This time didn't happen as much as the hack writers.  Finally, they gave the winner his due.  You know, he had the cover story, Mickelson on MSN.  You know, because I turned on...  I was listening to some sports radio that night.  And the announcers, Tiger Takes Fourth.  Talk about the fucking winner.  You know?  It's enough already.  Yeah, they had to at some point.  But there's another side of that. 
[02:16:00]  I mean, the ratings for this Masters was through the roof.  You know?  Yeah.  Because Tiger was coming back.  So, it's hard to completely ignore him.  Listen, he's obviously the best thing for golf.  But golf has been going on since when?  Probably 10, 20 years.  You know, whatever.  I mean, you know, after Nicholas.  I mean, Nicholas was such a rage back then.  You know?  And he faded.  And it's still...  Obviously, the ratings.  It's all about numbers in this world. 
[02:16:30]  But the game's going to last with or without them.  You know what I mean?  So, give other people their due.  Fucking that little Anthony Kim.  That fucking guy was...  He was on a comeback.  I hate the Asian golfers.  I said it yesterday.  Yeah, but I like Anthony Kim.  You know why?  Because they're robots.  There's no emotion.  And they barely miss a shot ever.  Anthony Kim is a little different.  I like seeing Phil Mickelson from the Pine Needles in the middle of the woods and going,  What the fuck?  Did you see him hit that fucking shot?  Exactly.  And Anthony Kim is right in the middle of the fairway.  Once again, like a robot.  Middle of the green, two-putt, move on to the next hole. 
[02:17:00]  I like these guys.  Fucking Phil Mickelson's drive once ended up in a trash bag.  I want to see that shit.  Yeah, the trash bag.  It did in the U.S. Open a few years back.  Get out of here, really?  He was in contention and his fucking drive ends up in an actual trash bag.  They didn't know what to do.  That's fucking a lot.  He hit that shot, though, out of the Pine Needles, and then he fucking missed the putt,  that fucking jimoke.  What's up, bro?  It was good.  I don't know.  There's just some violence going on.  No, it's just BJ Penn on fucking.  He's coming in tomorrow, and I'm just watching him on fucking. 
[02:17:30]  Who is he?  Whose ass is he handing?  He's playing with the Fox announcer.  Who is he?  He's a fucking UFC fighter.  He tied him up pretty good.  Dude, literally, it took one second to take that man down.  To take him down.  Yeah.  I'm annoyed we don't have his book.  Because he's here tomorrow.  It's funny.  You're really a big UFC fan now, aren't you?  I love it.  You love it?  Yeah.  It's so funny.  You're like a fat chick.  Why?  I just like a fat chick.  A groupie.  I love it.  You know, it's something you'll never be able to do, but you sit and watch it.  So what?  You love comedy?  I know. 
[02:18:00]  Why are you making fun of him for being a UFC fan?  Oh, shit.  Exactly.  That's weird, man.  It's ridiculous.  It's something.  A lot of guys are into the UFC.  Yeah, but those guys are semi-fit.  They're semi.  You can see them maybe doing it.  You can never see him.  You know what I mean?  But did you like baseball growing up?  Huh?  Did you like baseball?  I played baseball.  You watch movies.  Have you ever seen yourself act?  You played baseball?  What position?  Second base.  I'm a good infield.  When I played in your fucking game, I'm fucking... 
[02:18:30]  Why can't I like UFC?  What's wrong with you?  Nothing.  I'm glad you found something.  You love it?  I really do.  It's fun to watch, man.  It's a sport that I find really interesting.  I like the guys a lot.  They're all cool.  None of them are dicks.  Everyone I've ever met has been fucking nice.  I like them.  Because you're on the radio.  Do you think they're that nice to everybody?  They don't know who we are.  Yes, they are fan friendly.  Absolutely they are.  Dude, they bring the fighters over.  These guys don't know who we are.  Maybe I'll check with them.  They're the public.  But you were a big boxing fan, I thought. 
[02:19:00]  I still like boxing.  But boxers, a lot of the times, have not been fucking cool.  These guys are much cooler.  I mean, they're nicer dudes.  And I think what they do is a lot harder.  We got it.  When did we get this?  Just now.  Oh, great.  Thank you.  Came in.  And he signed it to you?  No, he's coming in tomorrow.  He's a big deal.  B.J. Penn.  Although he just lost on Saturday.  Yeah, he's one of the best.  What do you mean he's one of the best?  Everybody that comes in here is one of the best.  Who's the best?  Every time there's somebody in here, they're one of the best UFC.  That one black dude that's funny.  Ram Page Jackson. 
[02:19:30]  He's great.  He's funny.  He's got a good sense of humor.  He's supposed to be good.  Who's the other guy?  Lidell or whatever.  Chuck Lidell is retired, but now he's coming back to fight.  Isn't he going to be the main event?  Yeah, but he's not fighting Tito.  Is it 115?  115 in Vancouver.  Tito Beld?  What's that about?  He might be hurt.  I don't know.  I honestly don't know, but they're both hosting the fucking UFC show.  So there's only about four of them that are worth seeing, right?  Four or five?  No, there's actually a lot of them.  Really?  Anderson Silva is a fucking amazing fighter when he's not being a cunt.  Fucking Shane Carlin.  Lesnar's fun to watch.  St. Pierre.  Yeah, St. Pierre.  I like fucking even...  How about this one?  This one. 
[02:20:00]  That's Charlie.  Leave Charlie alone, man.  There's a fucking WEC fight.  I really want to see this.  The lighter.  Whatever.  All right.  So I'm just asking him.  How could you not like it?  You're a guy that did karate and likes fighting.  These guys can all have fucking amazing fighters.  Big love because Taekwondo, when you used to watch karate tournaments, it was more technique.  I mean, it was different.  These guys would murder a Taekwondo fighter.  Of course they would.  If it's two different styles, of course they would.  They would fucking grab the leg and break them in half.  But watching the Taekwondo tournament is fucking great. 
[02:20:30]  The kicks.  This, you don't see as many kicks.  It's just a fucking bar brawl.  It's more of a bar brawl.  I don't think you've ever seen a UFC match.  Nah, there's a lot of technique now.  Have you seen Mirko Krokop?  Fucking silly goose.  He's fighting again, by the way, for the UFC.  Oh, really?  Mirko Krokop?  You don't know what it's with kicks?  I don't think you've seen a UFC match.  Yeah, with the...  Can you go to Krokop Highlights Day and then kiss me the lips firmly?  Let me say hi to Terry in Dallas.  Terry!  Hey, Terry.  Hiya.  I wanted to say, you fuckers owe me $12 for my dinner last night. 
[02:21:00]  I was listening to that fucking replay, and I pulled over on the side of the road and  tossed cookies after hearing that head cheese bit.  Oh, yeah.  E-Rock ate head cheese on the show yesterday.  I put the video up on my YouTube channel, Opio Radio.  Today, they're supposed to be eating pork brains.  What happened?  Yeah, we couldn't get any.  And I literally, I pulled over on the side of the road, and I had, like, exorcist vomit,  dude.  And I puked on a fucking car driving by.  A lot of people didn't understand why the head cheese tasted so bad.  I don't know.  Because a lot of people are saying it's a delicacy.  Really?  Bob Kelly was saying he loves it.  No.  I don't know. 
[02:21:30]  Just the way y'all were describing it, it couldn't be good.  It couldn't be edible.  Well, check out the video.  It's even worse if you see the video.  It's horrible.  It really is.  It smelled awful.  I couldn't even imagine eating that shit.  No.  Granules of gristle and bone.  As a new listener, I appreciate the show.  It's an awesome show, man.  I keep listening.  Hey, thanks, man.  Hey, did you watch the dome go down in Dallas?  No, I was actually, I'm up here in Michigan right now.  I wasn't able to.  Oh, okay.  I wasn't able to be home.  Right, right, right.  Did you watch your whole state go down? 
[02:22:00]  What's that mean?  Michigan.  Oh, Michigan.  I thought he was from Dallas.  I think he's just visiting Michigan.  Oh, yeah, I drive a truck.  I drive a truck.  I drive all over the place.  All right.  Thanks, brother.  Now we're just watching.  We're just watching Crow Cop work out.  Fast forward, Danny, see if you can get some fights.  His left leg is fucking deadly.  It's like Bill Wallace.  On Thunderfoot.  Remember Bill Wallace?  Yes, I know who he is.  No, you don't.  I met Bill Wallace.  I got his autograph. 
[02:22:30]  I wish you would have signed it with his foot across your cheekbone.  Is that your wish?  He only had one wish.  All right, why don't we.  Real quick, I just want to tell you how Callaway must feel fucked.  They say anybody that buys their driver and if Phil Mickelson wins, they get it for free.  Callaway had a promotion before the fucking Masters.  Wow.  Anybody that buys a Callaway driver by this time gets it free if Mickelson wins.  So they have to give all that money back?  Yeah.  A refund or whatever?  Yeah, to everybody.  Wow.  That's a dumb deal by Callaway.  I think they lost a lot of money. 
[02:23:00]  They probably had an insurance thing.  That's how they work, though.  Yeah, it's like a hole-in-one thing.  Yeah, they take out an insurance policy and pay some premiums and then the insurance company  is like, I'll take the gamble.  Yeah.  Because the odds are he's not going to owe fuck.  That's a hell of a left foot he's got there.  Wow, he just put that guy right down on the ground.  See, but that's not UFC.  Yes, it is.  It's mixed martial arts.  Oh, it is?  It's kickboxing.  How come there's no dome?  Where's the dome?  It's a different league or whatever, yeah, where they use a ring.  But it's the same, you know.  A boxing ring. 
[02:23:30]  It's weird watching a real man do things that real men should do.  I know.  Look at that.  Look at this.  I can't stop eating rolls.  You've been in that position.  Look at that.  Look at the size of that fucking black dude.  That is a big guy he's fighting right there.  Holy shit.  Don't matter.  And he's pounding his face.  Don't matter.  But watch this guy.  It looks like he's crying at one point.  Look, he falls.  He's crying.  I like how he fights in his polka-dotted underwear.  Oh, dude.  Mirko Krokop.  What cheeks he has.  Cheeks.  He's fighting again, though.  He fucking got beat up in the UFC.  He didn't do that well. 
[02:24:00]  Ow.  All right.  Why don't we move on?  Ant's got the big date tonight.  And Rich has no idea about this date.  Oh, really?  So we're excited for Anthony there.  Yeah.  It's a big date.  Going out with a penthouse pet of the year.  Oh.  The penthouse pet of the year.  The latest penthouse pet of the year.  Oh, this one you don't have to pick up at the bus stop.  No one.  Taylor Vixen.  Like a runaway.  Really?  You're going with a penthouse girl?  Yeah.  She's the pet of the year.  We set up a little date, and she went for it.  So they're going out tonight.  That's fucked up that the radio, that the DJ has to win his own contest to go on a fucking date. 
[02:24:30]  There was no contest.  It wasn't a contest.  It's funny, but there was no contest.  It wasn't a contest.  I just asked.  Yeah.  Am I the 10th caller?  I said, uh.  Yes, you are.  Good.  I should, uh.  They're going to a Brazilian steakhouse.  Oh, that shit is off the fucking hook.  You've been there?  Yes, yo.  With the paddle?  I've been to one.  I've been to Brazil.  And you could eat.  Oh.  This is who Ant's going out with tonight.  See, but already the mystery is gone. 
[02:25:00]  The mystery is gone.  That's not.  The mystery of how your weenie feels in there.  What's wrong?  You don't like seeing fucking, uh.  It's gross.  There's no penis.  You don't like seeing a.  There's no penis.  What don't you like about that shot?  That pussy is amazing.  What don't you like about that shot?  What?  That?  Yeah.  Taylor Vixen is on her side.  She's petting here.  Showing the goods.  Showing the brown eye.  First of all.  Brown eye and the puss.  That thing's got to be gigantic.  What part?  Point.  The puss.  He's pointing at my dick.  The puss.  The puss. 
[02:25:30]  I mean, you got to be packing to fill that fucking beehive.  Anthony laughs at big vaginas.  I got confidence.  Yeah, he laughs.  I got some confidence there.  You know.  I think I'd be able to.  You like that?  I mean, God's not going to completely punish you.  He gave you something.  Jesus.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Fucking rich.  What the fuck, dude?  He gave you a nice cock.  What the fuck, man?  What about that shot?  Taylor Vixen.  It's Taylor Vixen on Twitter.  That's an airbrush.  That's a good shot. 
[02:26:00]  That's a poster shot.  You don't like the asshole with a little dirt in it?  I like to see it.  We like assholes with a little dirt.  Just a little dirt, we call it.  A little soil.  I like a pretty face and firm breasts.  Nice little firm breasts.  Not like fucking out of shape because she had a baby breast.  Nice, firm.  Oh, shit.  What happened?  No, she's got nice breasts.  I like them.  They're nice and, you know.  You don't like an ass cave?  A good ass cave?  A nice ass.  Donnie's get a little?  No, she's got nice tits.  What happened after the kid, though?  They get a little?  No, they, no. 
[02:26:30]  Little?  Little?  No, did they get a little, like, saggier?  No, not at all.  Nipple discoloration?  No, they're perfect.  Yeah?  They are.  They're perfect.  That's good, right?  That's cool.  Now, I'm glad because a lot of guys complain.  Well, they, I don't know why they would complain.  We're showing you Taylor Vixen pictures.  They're hysterical.  What about that one?  There's too much pussy in it.  It takes away from everything else.  Give Ann a little advice.  What are you talking about?  Give you some advice?  Too much pussy in a picture? 
[02:27:00]  How does that happen?  Because then it takes away.  It's one of the full frontal pictures.  Listen, if you're looking at pictures.  Standing up.  Like, yesterday, for real, Bonnie, I was looking through a catalog.  Bonnie was in the car looking at a catalog at Victoria's Secret models.  They're so fucking fine, these girls.  It's all about airbrushing.  They're all airbrushed.  It's all airbrushed.  But they are really hot.  They're hot.  They're hot with your clothes on.  And you're not seeing their pussy.  And you're just fantasizing about what it would be like to fucking hit them with a shovel and then fuck them. 
[02:27:30]  Okay?  But they're so hot like that.  I'm with you, Rich.  A little clothes doesn't hurt.  Ann likes totally nude, though.  Ann's a totally nude guy.  Yeah, I'm a totally nude.  Like, do you really think that's nice?  Look at those gross tits.  You think fat tits?  Yes, that's nice.  You like that?  I love that.  Yeah, because the word fat is in it, and you can relate to it.  Ann's going on with that tonight.  Oh, my God.  That's her?  What's wrong with you?  She's great, dude.  What if they become boyfriend and girlfriend for three months?  Oh, no, she's not bad.  Look at those giant juicy tits and those legs.  She's fucking hot.  No more summers of lust.  Dude, you're out of your mind, Rich. 
[02:28:00]  Wait, you think that's hot?  Yes.  Yes.  It's over the whole country.  Wait, go back to that shot.  What's wrong with the picture?  Those big juicy tits?  I don't know.  I want to suck them.  She's a corn-fed Texas girl.  Oh, God.  Corn-fed fat tits.  Corn-fed?  I would suck them for fucking weeks.  It's not a cock.  Relax.  What's wrong with that picture we were just seeing?  Foss is an odd guy.  I'm not odd.  I like a pretty...  Look at...  She's beautiful.  I'll show you some pictures.  Go back real quick.  Look at those thick legs, too. 
[02:28:30]  I like a fucking corn-fed juicy thigh.  Like, this one right here is a much better picture.  Much better.  Look at that.  Look how sexy that...  Is that her?  Yeah.  Yes.  Okay.  Her tits, they look nice.  Look at that.  How could...  That picture right there is enough to go, man, I'd like to fuck her.  And then, you know, right there.  Right, but the other one's not with her big fat tits.  The other one was just as good.  Can we see the Santa hat?  Yeah, the other one's just as good, Rich.  Can we see her fat tits?  She looks better with dark hair.  I don't care about her hair.  Yeah.  I wouldn't care if Al Zarkawi was holding it in his right hand. 
[02:29:00]  The fucking tits are amazing.  How could you even get to her face when you got those big boobs there, Rich?  Really?  The left one's a little bigger than the right, too.  Nice, right?  My mother had big tits like that.  Who killed?  Oh, Christ.  It's just big.  Those big tits.  I'm sure they look just like that.  And by accident, you'd see them and you'd fucking hate tits.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We got to slow down.  All right.  I think we know what happened there.  We got a bad boy...  Someone hates mother.  We got a bad boy Bubby on us.  We do.  Remember bad boy Bubby? 
[02:29:30]  And you hate tits.  You don't like big tits because of your mom?  Danny, don't show any more pictures right now.  I don't like women because of my mom.  Don't get distracted.  I don't like women because of my mom.  What was wrong with your mom and her big boobs?  Just, you know, you don't want to see...  Did you see your mom naked once?  Yes.  And I would roll over and say, put your clothes on.  Yeah, I've seen her.  You've never seen your mom naked?  One time.  No.  Only once?  She was tying my brother's shoe and she leaned over.  That's not naked.  That's her breast.  That was good enough for me. 
[02:30:00]  What did she do when she did it?  Nothing.  Deserves something.  One time.  Yeah, she had a little thing on.  My mom had a nice set.  Let me see what...  Ugh!  Your mom had a nice set.  You just said...  Ugh!  Ugh!  She had big boobs.  What can I tell you?  As you eat yoga, you're talking about...  I saw my mother breastfeeding my sister.  Her and my dad told me to come in and watch.  What?  Why?  Twist it. 
[02:30:30]  Again, it's...  That's how you raise little birds.  It's...  Who's 30?  You know, I'm 41.  My sister is 34.  You're seven.  It was a long time ago, so they were probably...  You know, they were like, it's natural.  You should see it.  It's healthy.  No, it's not.  Oh, really?  From the guy that had to take a shower with his brother and his father?  Okay.  That was a long...  Thank you.  That was when I was...  Okay.  It was like before kindergarten.  Yeah, that's not...  I had to learn how to take a shower.  Really?  With the whole block? 
[02:31:00]  Foster didn't like seeing his little girl get a tattoo right to my defense.  What?  Yeah, it was just natural.  So I watched.  It was weird.  It must have been.  Yeah, for a seven-year-old, it's weird, I think.  Did you see her nipple and everything?  I don't...  I think so, but just watching my sister's feet.  Did you suck on it?  What was wrong with Ed Sullivan?  Did your mom have good feeders?  Yeah, exactly.  Topo GQ.  Did your mom have good feeders?  Yeah, well, I guess all right for that.  It didn't do anything for me.  Were they engorged?  Did you just say it didn't do anything for me?  Meaning I didn't... 
[02:31:30]  Well, he's asking me if they didn't have nice feet.  He's asking if she had nice tits.  At seven, you didn't see him under your porch?  Yeah.  Please.  At seven years old, you don't know if your mom has nice tits.  He asked me.  How old are you when you get your first hard-on?  Do you remember?  Depends.  I would get my penis sucked at that age, and it wouldn't get hard, but my friends would.  I didn't even know what erections were.  That's how young I was when I was doing that.  I couldn't even tell you.  Me and my friend would blow each other, and I didn't know that your dick was supposed  to get hard.  Mine didn't get hard.  At 25, you didn't know your dick was supposed to get hard? 
[02:32:00]  I was confused.  He said he had a gig for me.  So I said, I'll kiss the noodle, mister.  Your friend would blow each other at how old?  I want to say...  I want to say never.  But yes.  But I was...  Wait, hold on.  Honestly.  That means what age will the audience accept?  No.  He was, I think, in first grade, and I was 36.  No, we were both very, very young. 
[02:32:30]  I had no concept of cumming, and I literally didn't...  When his penis got hard, I didn't know what that meant.  Mine didn't get hard.  Mine just stayed soft.  You didn't know what that meant?  Put the lube on your ass.  That's what it meant.  Yeah, you're getting that.  Wait, now he got hard at...  How old was he about?  Again, we were both...  I think he was a year older than me.  How can...  I was in kindergarten, first grade.  There's no way a first grader could get a hard on.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe he was two years older, but it was the same age.  I get, like, I didn't know what it was or something, but I'd get boners in, like, kindergarten. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Ugh.  No.  Yeah.  See, I can't think that far back.  I'd look at the school...  I don't remember.  I'd look at the class picture and look at, like, some of the girls and be like, ooh,  and I'd get a boner and not know why or what to do with it.  Yeah, me and my cousin used to, like, play, like, little...  Gay doctor and stuff, and we, like...  Gay doctor?  You know, we...  Dr. Steve?  You'd make shitty wine for each other and hate Dr. Kaku?  I would sleep at his fucking house, go over his house, and then, you know, we'd touch 
[02:33:30]  dicks and this and that, but he'd always go, you know, sleep in my bed, and I'd go, no,  because he peed the bed.  Okay, so I wasn't sleeping in my bed.  Yeah, that's disgusting.  But we never blew each other.  We didn't know what that was.  You still touch dicks.  Yeah, like every kid.  Might as well.  No.  No.  Well, the thing is, we did blow each other.  A lot.  A lot?  Yeah, and then...  Why, does it feel good?  Yeah, I remember it feeling decent. 
[02:34:00]  Rich, you do that?  A little docking.  What do they call it?  That's docking.  What's wrong with you?  Where have you been?  Where have I been?  Yeah.  Not there.  Not there, but that...  You can tell that's a nice cock right there.  See, that's right there.  Not the one with the fucking...  Ugh.  The extra skin.  Which cock do you like, Rich?  Have a look at yours.  I like the fucking turtleneck.  No, you want the one on the right?  The one on the right's nice, right?  That's a nice cock.  The guy has a nice body and everything. 
[02:34:30]  See, that's a better shot.  That's a better shot than that stupid girl's pussy any day.  Two guys docking?  No, no.  It's better than a dirty asshole?  If you took away that fucking tube...  Are you out of your mind?  You'd rather look at a guy's dick picture.  If you could put a picture of a nice cock in a guy and a naked girl next to each other.  See what you think looks better.  That's all.  I'm not saying in a gay way.  I don't need the pictures.  Well, how is it not in a gay way?  It's just a human body.  More docking.  Like, if you...  What would be more exciting to watch in porn for you? 
[02:35:00]  A girl blowing a guy or a girl eating another girl's pussy?  Depends on the people.  A blowjob is different, though.  A girl blowing a guy is more exciting than watching two girls.  Exactly, because you're like, ah, fucking lucky girl.  Yeah, I've used that.  Yeah, I've said that many a times.  No, I understand that because you can relate to getting blown.  And again, for me, pussy eating, two girls eating pussy is not even...  That's so boring.  It's not boring.  It's just...  It's not boring.  When you're a sex addict or when you've seen a lot of pussy and a lot of nonsense, it 
[02:35:30]  loses its effect because it's not taboo anymore.  You think you're a sex addict?  You think that...  No, you're saying...  You don't think I'm a...  What are you, fucking nuts?  I don't know if the word addict is the word you use for sex.  No, addict is not.  I'm not a sex thing in the top of the house.  No, addict.  I'm a sex addict.  Really, you're a sex addict.  You really have...  So you're saying, like, you're comparing it to alcohol and drugs where you have to physically...  And mentally...  No, I'm comparing it to food addiction where there is... 
[02:36:00]  No, food addiction, you need to live.  You have to have food to live.  Yeah, but sex is also an extraordinarily instinct-based thing.  You don't need it to, quote-unquote, survive, but to say you're going to go without having  sexual thoughts or feelings is unrealistic.  Okay, everybody has thoughts and feelings.  You're right.  Everybody does.  So what I'm saying is I compare sex addiction to food addiction because you can't be abstinent  from it to be healthy, so you have to find a fucking healthy way of doing it.  So that's what I compare it to.  But, okay, but as an addict, okay, you like sex and it obsesses you a little...  And fuck hookers in Brazil without a rubber. 
[02:36:30]  That doesn't mean you're sex.  That means you're stupid.  Of course it does.  It means you're stupid.  It's part of an addiction.  When you're drunk driving, that's one of the signs that you got a fucking problem drinking  because of the risks you're taking, the insanity you're displaying.  Oh, the police have the problem.  They're stupid numbers.  I don't know.  I just, it's hard to comprehend, you know, because when you're fucking stealing and robbing  to get high and fucking, you know, hitting people over the head, you don't seem like 
[02:37:00]  you're doing that for sex.  She looked good.  She looked good.  That ass looked great.  Of course she looks good, but...  But it's, you know...  Sorry.  It's fucking...  Yeah, it's for PR people.  That's probably...  Sorry.  I apologize.  It's an addiction.  I threw you right out of that.  I'm sorry.  Do you think it's an addiction?  He'll let tequila walk by our studio.  I think with some certain people, it is.  Other people, I think, just like to fuck and use it as an excuse for cheating. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  I agree with you, too.  You're right.  But, um, and I think it's one of the most widely used excuses for cheating is saying,  oh, well, I got to go to therapy now because I'm addicted.  Meanwhile, you're just going, hi, I'm just like, fuck.  Do you understand?  I would ride in circles for hours, and I mean, hours, ritualistically looking at prostitutes,  and I would only let them get in the car if they talked to me through the right side of  the window.  I would leave sometimes start at one o'clock in the morning after gigs and go home at  six thirty in the morning when the sun was coming up, and I wouldn't even get one. 
[02:38:00]  It was just to keep it fueled.  It was insanity.  So, the thing is, as far as Jimmy's concerned, it seems to me, like, if you like something  really a lot, you have some kind of problem with it.  Like, I don't know how to do it in moderation.  Like, looking at a prostitute, going out and getting blown once in a while, I would drive  around when I wasn't horny.  My dick wasn't hard.  I would just be zoning out as, like, a drug.  Yeah, but you're doing it because you're also, you're bored, and you have nothing.  That's what you know.  Boredom is one thing, but when you're riding around for five hours a night looking at prostitutes 
[02:38:30]  isn't explained away by, fuck it, I need a hobby.  Okay, first of all, let's let the audience know the word isn't riding, it's cruising.  Let's go with the right word.  Oh, cruising, right.  But I've done it for hours.  The amount of hours, it's all time.  Like, when you start jerking off, and literally, you find that you're jerking off six hours  later, and you haven't come because you're getting high, and you're zoning out, it's  unhealthy behavior, dude.  I'm telling you, you have no...  High?  High?  It's a high. 
[02:39:00]  It's a fucking zone out.  It's like, when people binge eat, it's a fucking...  Come on, man, you're supposed to know a lot about addiction.  No, I do, but I just never, I never, I, like, jerking, I never felt a high from it.  When you jerk off, you pretty much jerk off just to come, right?  I mean, you come when you jerk off, like, quickly?  I do it to get the fucking family out of the room.  Rich will be at Bananas this weekend.  Yeah, I do it to shoot a load, and I could do it quicker than anybody. 
[02:39:30]  I'm like a, I could do it like that.  I don't.  I never let myself...  For six hours, you've jerked off.  Without a duty, I've had marathon jerks, where, again, it's like you just, you're fucking  riding...  You stop.  You'll jerk, stop, for...  Jerk, stop, jerk, stop.  You're on line.  After a while?  Yeah, but you're just playing.  It's a crazy...  You're talking on Insta Messenger.  But I mean, the next day, you're like, fuck, you're feeling your dick because it's long?  No, no, no, because I'm not jerking hard, but you're getting close, you're stopping,  and then you get up, you eat something, you come back, you fuck...  It's crazy.  I'm telling you, it's fucking...  Back to work.  Yeah, it really is. 
[02:40:00]  Okay, so, okay, so say you like that.  Now, you take, say, like, let's just say, Tiger, even though I hate talking about him,  who fucks all these broads, he's just fucking getting pussy.  That is not the same type of obsession compulsion that you're talking about.  I'll tell you why I don't agree, because, again, the risks he took were addict behavior.  Like, he was fucking all these girls without rubber.  He's got a billion dollar empire.  Because it feels better.  Nah, but that's, dude, there's a craziness that goes with being an addict that's fucking...  People are willing to take a chance of consequences just to feel good. 
[02:40:30]  But not on...  And without having a...  It doesn't necessarily have to be a problem.  Dude, there's a billion dollars at stake.  Yeah, without a rubber.  A billion dollars.  And half of that in a divorce, if you get...  It's like...  It's not that if he caught the fucking...  I'm just saying that the risks for there, there's no way feeling good,  because if it was all about feeling good, you would get one mistress,  you'd pay her, have her fucking tubes tied, and get her disease tested often,  because you're on top of a billion fucking dollars. 
[02:41:00]  Well, then you'd have to get, like, eight mistresses and a Perkins waitress.  See him hit a ball when he's this thin.  No, but you know what I mean?  That's fucking...  Use him as a club.  If it's just a guy getting laid, you get one side piece,  you fucking...  You sugar daddy-er, and you get her tested often.  That's what you do if you're fucking without a rubber and just want to feel good.  But so you're saying, hey, he's just fucking broads in different places.  You know, he's living...  I don't think he's idiotic like you are.  I think he's living the celebrity life going, hey, I'm fucking this broad here. 
[02:41:30]  I'm fucking him.  You know, you, you're driving around.  It's a whole different type of level of...  We don't know all of his ins and outs.  He was fucking them in his house, in his truck.  Like, he fucked...  He was pulling out tampons in parking lots.  Apparently, he fucked his teenage...  Yeah, the girl down the street.  Yeah.  The risk you take by doing that, the risk for fucking losing your marriage,  fucking humiliating your kids, the risk for...  It's like there's too many risks to explain away just feeling good. 
[02:42:00]  If he got blown, you know, ah, it's one thing.  He's fucking raw in his office, in his house with his crib.  It's crazy.  All he stands to do is lose.  Well, there's winning when you, like, feel good and you're coming and some chick.  When your ball's deep.  Yeah.  Perkins waitress.  When you hand grenade a girl on her period.  Like, like, you know what?  Oh, my God.  I don't think I've ever heard that before.  Hand grenade her.  You pull the string. 
[02:42:30]  Just pull that fucking, pull it out.  Her head pops and confetti comes out.  I'm going in.  To me, Letterman was a guy just getting laid.  He doesn't seem like an addict.  He picked, like, one or two chicks and whatever.  You know what I mean?  You know what?  That's not a guy running around being crazy.  He was extremely cautious.  He took a few small risks here because he was probably horny.  Making out with her in the park, in the driveway was stupid.  But he's not a guy who was behaving like a lunatic.  That's how a guy behaves when he just wants to get laid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  So you corrected me.  Thank you.  All right.  Hey, we got a couple good things to play for everybody here today.  I do wait. 
[02:43:00]  Well, you're a fucking Yankee guy, Chan Ho, right?  Chan Ho Park?  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Had a bad performance.  He had a bad outing.  And apparently a novel excuse.  Yeah.  Check this out.  Sick?  What?  I had a lot of diarrhea.  Are you welcome?  That's what you want to know?  Your manager said you were sick.  Yeah.  I had a lot of diarrhea.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  I had an diarrhea and then...  Why?  Why is it funny?  I don't know.  I mean...  Save it.  Off day, off day, I had a lot of diarrhea.  And I feel very...  For what I did yesterday, I went through, too. 
[02:44:00]  A little.  A lot of cough.  And then, you know, just chest hurts.  And if you have dehydrated, something like that.  Oh, my God.  He's blaming a bad performance on diarrhea.  Who's the guy that's just laughing his ass off?  They're in the locker room, so it's the players.  That is a little diarrhea.  He's a reporter, obviously, right?  Diarrhea.  In the locker room, asking him about his bad performance.  He goes, all right, you want to know?  Diarrhea.  Little diarrhea.  You think that's what he had?  Or one of them said, no, no, it's diarrhea.  And fucking...  He might have had a fucking bad elbow or something. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  How do you say that?  Diarrhea.  Yes, I had the diarrhea.  Diarrhea.  Diarrhea.  Diarrhea.  That's fucking great, man.  Cha-cha-cha.  He was fucking squirting.  You ever have diarrhea, Rich?  The worst is when you get the cramps right here.  And you go, if it's going to come out, then you run home.  Like, when I was a kid, I got cramped so fucking bad.  I was like four blocks from my house.  And I'm running home.  And then I stop and keel over into pain. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  And then I fucking got home.  I ran upstairs.  And as I'm opening my pants, I shit all over the bathroom.  It flew out like a fucking mudslide.  It was like dead third world kids below my ass.  It was horrible.  It just went everywhere.  And then what you had to do...  Then what you had to do is go and hug your mother's big, juicy tits.  They were nice tits, huh?  Well, fucking diarrhea.  What were they?  Like 36 double Ds?  38 long? 
[02:45:30]  What did your mom have, man?  I want to know.  I don't know.  Puddle of Bates wants us to start a little goodness gracious diarrhea of all the dramatic  things.  Oh, God.  Where's my fucking clips?  Diarrhea.  Diarrhea.  Diarrhea.  Diarrhea.  There's something about that...  Hold on.  It has to be...  Goodness gracious!  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen!  There's liquid shit on the mound!  Who's that fucking... 
[02:46:00]  Is that that broad...  What's her name?  That announcer.  Nobody acknowledge him.  What's her name?  Billie Jean King.  No, I said girl.  Who the fuck...  Oh, Sue...  Susan something.  Susan?  Sue.  Susan, yeah.  Susan Walker.  No.  It was actually Susan Walker.  Yeah, Susan Walker.  It isn't.  Yeah, it's Susan.  The fucking Yankee announcer?  Yeah.  Susan Walker.  It's not Susan Walker.  Then who is it?  I don't know.  Susan something.  And what were you going to say?  I'm sorry.  No, it's all right.  It's just the expectation you get when you're close to the toilet. 
[02:46:30]  You can be like running to the house or in the car or something.  And then the second you get into your house and that toilet is close, your body just gives  up.  I know.  It's like you can hold on in the car.  You're like...  And then it's like, oh, come on.  I just gotta get on.  I just gotta get my pants down.  It's very close.  I once had it so bad.  True story. 
[02:47:00]  I shit on a sidewalk in Manhattan.  Get the fuck in.  It was late at night.  I was trying to get home.  I knew I wasn't gonna make it.  I looked around.  There was no one around.  And I swear to God, I fucking dropped chow, spread my fucking cheeks, and spread liquid  diarrhea all over the sidewalk.  I've never admitted this before in my life, but I swear to you, it went down.  This was when we were off the air.  Jesus, you really took it hard.  I fucking just shit on the sidewalk in Manhattan. 
[02:47:30]  Yep.  True story.  True fucking story.  I was scared shitless someone was gonna catch me, but I didn't care at that point.  I was in desperate need of a toilet, and I couldn't find one.  Your body just knows.  Huh?  One time I was shitting in...  Your body just knows.  I was shitting in the woods, and this Russian guy comes running past me.  That was a callback from your earlier Sopranos.  We understand.  No, you didn't.  I was good.  I was gonna get that one.  Yes, we did.  But you don't give anyone time to figure out where you're going sometimes.  Whenever a laugh isn't there, you just explain it. 
[02:48:00]  Well, it's because I saw the fucking disgust in Anthony's face.  He knew what you meant.  You think you're gonna go over Anthony's head?  He knew what you meant.  I said I saw the disgust like it didn't work, but it was a good callback, I would think.  Well, Anthony.  Are you psyched about this date tonight?  Oh, yeah.  You know, it's one of those things where it's like, you know, when else was I gonna get  a chance to go out with the Penthouse Pet of the Year?  Please, God, let her charge him at the end of the date.  Will that be hysterical? 
[02:48:30]  Well, I would pay it.  I'd be so happy it happened to you.  Oh, see, when we were talking in studio, I thought you picked up on what this is about.  Yeah, that's $2,500.  Yes, for dinner and companionship.  Oh, here you go.  And you put it in my hiney hole, so that's another five grand.  Sorry, sorry.  No, it's just one of those things, you know.  It's one of those things you gotta check off on your little list of things to do.  Your bucket list?  Do you have a bucket list?  No, a fuck it list.  It's funny, you guys are making a big deal about this date, and she's probably with a 
[02:49:00]  friend going, I don't know, some fucking guy.  Exactly.  That's exactly what I'm thinking.  He's not making a big deal out of it.  We're trying to get some shit out of it.  He's like, whatever.  He's gotta be excited.  He's gonna fucking go to a Brazilian steakhouse and eat so much meat, he's gonna have to  take a shit in the hotel room.  I'm gonna have the fucking dump sweats.  Oh, I gotta go to the bathroom.  Wait, I gotta go to the lobby.  Just hang out here for a minute.  And then I'll go down, take a dump, come back, all my shit will be gone.  I'll have been robbed.  I hope she goes to blow you, but your fucking balls and assholes smell like fucking, I've 
[02:49:30]  been shitting balls.  I hope you have, I've been shit like this toilet water splashed up on your bag, and there's  little flecks of your own shit under your balls.  I hope she goes to blow you and you hear, she goes to tongue your bag and it's speckled  like a fucking, like AIDS balls.  She's gonna go, was you ever take dirt bike riding?  That is, man.  Yeah, she's gonna buy you fucking, keep on your balls. 
[02:50:00]  Just hang them on the taint so nothing gets in there.  She goes into her pocketbook and pulls out a squeegee.  Well, you chose to go to an all-you-can-eat place, first date, and you guys are gonna eat  a lot of meat.  What do you think, I'm gonna be sitting there pigging out on fucking meat?  How much meat will you eat on a first date with a penthouse pet?  And they're gonna have two pieces of lettuce and a quart of gin.  That's exactly it.  But that's the type of place you eat until you fucking can't move.  No, I'm just gonna fucking eat like a human. 
[02:50:30]  You should just pig out in front of her.  Just keep eating meat.  I wanna see how much she can fucking eat.  While you're joking with her and you're having a nice time, go, look, let's do this.  Let's just eat until we're both shitting our pants.  Please say that.  Say let's eat until we're fucking, until our logs are poking out like fucking, like little  turtles.  We have to fight over who gets the bathroom at the hotel first.  You ever see a taxi episode where fucking Louie's meeting Zina's parents and he's trying  to be charming but he's bombing horribly and he's saying how good the food is. 
[02:51:00]  He goes, we may have to race for the can after.  Really?  We may have to have a race for the can.  Race for the can.  You're getting a hotel room?  No, I'm just saying I'm staying in the city because I can't.  Boy, does he miss the important part of the story.  You're dating a penthouse pet.  Really?  You have amenities in the room?  No, because I thought maybe he wouldn't stay there tonight.  I need a room in New York.  I was gonna take it over if he was leaving.  Ass?  No.  I can't very well go out and then commute.  You guys want a diarrhea contest? 
[02:51:30]  What do you mean?  What?  Did I stop everyone?  Dead in our tracks.  Who would be in for a diarrhea contest?  I never know when I'm gonna have it.  Danny's definitely in.  I have solid logs though.  No, no.  I'm telling you.  They're all over the city.  This Jackson Hole place that has burgers.  A hundred different burgers you could fucking order.  Sure, I will guarantee if we get a round of burgers, at least half the room will fucking  have diarrhea within a half hour.  Not me.  Let's have a diarrhea contest. 
[02:52:00]  Who's in?  No.  Rich?  No, I don't get diarrhea.  Exactly.  You will if you eat one of these burgers.  I don't eat red meat.  Do they have turkey burgers?  What the fuck's wrong with you guys?  Jimmy, would you do a diarrhea contest with me?  I know.  Well, I can't do it today, but I mean, I would do it someday.  I'm not gonna induce diarrhea on myself.  Let's do it Friday, eh?  What's wrong with you?  I can't induce diarrhea on myself.  Why don't you get some fucking listeners to come in and...  No, we do it.  How are you gonna do it?  I'll do it if someone joins me.  And you sit in the toilet?  What happens is, you eat these burgers, I'm telling you, your stomach starts gurgling 
[02:52:30]  or whatever immediately.  I'm telling you.  I believe it.  But then what happens?  First fucking guy that shoots fucking liquid shit wins.  A hundred dollars a man.  Let's go.  You win or not, Rich?  What happens in the 50-gallon drum channel?  Well, yeah, we'd like to do that again.  You can't do that?  We can't do shit.  Why do you think we just sit here and talk now?  We can't do shit.  You gotta put a contest.  We could do liquid diarrhea, though.  But no one wants in.  Come on, Ant. 
[02:53:00]  For a time's sake.  No, I can't.  I don't like diarrhea.  My goal is to see...  No one likes diarrhea.  Why don't we do this?  Oh, I'm in.  Let's get two listeners.  Rich, you in?  No.  Let's get two listeners and give them a great prize.  Two guys.  But to get the prize, they have to fucking sit.  They have to, like, kind of squat back to back and both shit into buckets while squatting back to back.  All right.  Get one of the...  Oh, God.  That's great.  Get one of the knuckleheads down the hall to fucking run that by the lawyers, please. 
[02:53:30]  Why not?  The lawyers are going to just...  You can't shit into a bucket?  No.  What happened to radio?  Of course you can't.  Not only radio, satellite radio.  I think you can.  You expect them to say no on regular radio.  People get satellite radio just to hear people...  I will bet money they will have a problem with that.  I will bet on that, too.  Yeah.  I'll take a bet on that.  I'll take all bets on that.  Some type of bodily, fluid, function-y things.  But if we all eat burgers and all of a sudden one of us has to fucking run to the bathroom, then, you know, that's good.  Come on, Ant.  No.  I'm not going to do that. 
[02:54:00]  Danny?  It's just me and Danny so far?  I shan't be partying with that.  We need a few more people.  E-Rock's in.  E-Rock will do it.  You think Kenny will do it?  No.  Kenny, you want in on our diarrhea contest?  He's shaking his head no.  Fuck.  What?  Let me see.  How thin...  Can I see your wallet?  No.  Why?  Can I see the wallet?  No, you definitely can't see anything.  Oh, really?  Really?  Oh, really?  Smash it?  Yeah, because you're allowed to.  I'm past that.  That's like hack now for me, if I do shit like that. 
[02:54:30]  Try and do new stuff.  Let me see your wallet.  You'll cut it up.  Let me see your wallet.  Let's get back to your diarrhea contest.  How about you trust me for once?  We've been friends forever.  Trust me.  I trust you.  Let me see your wallet.  I'll prove it.  I don't...  Guys don't let guys see other...  I do new stuff and I won't do anything with your wallet.  There's nothing to see in my fucking wallet.  I want to go through it and make a bid out of it.  Let me see what's in your wallet.  Please listen to me, fucking prop act.  You're not going to take my wallet and do fucking ten minutes on my wallet, okay?  Hey, put up the plastic. 
[02:55:00]  Gallagher.  I got it.  See, why does he...  You don't let anyone in the house to do that.  Why'd you do that?  Some people don't get a lot of it.  All right.  Sometimes I'm over the head.  It's like my fucking diarrhea bit's going to be a bust.  Iraq, you in?  Liquid diarrhea contact?  He says no?  Wait, how did you set up...  What the fuck's wrong with you guys?  How did you set up this date with Iraq?  What's wrong with us?  I expected you to say no.  She came in.  She was a guest.  Iraq.  She was a guest.  You can do it if it's not on the air and you don't describe it.  So, what's the point? 
[02:55:30]  Wait, what do you mean?  This isn't a regular radio.  What do you mean you can't...  Wait, you talked to somebody about this already?  Yeah.  Who?  Who?  Who?  Gary, who was...  How does he know?  Did he talk to anyone yet?  It falls under defecation and bodily fluid.  Yeah, but that's it.  Half these channels fall under defecation.  Every time I talk...  Every time I talk, body fluid.  Wait, there's a defecation rule?  What is the defecation rule?  Please...  But I want to see the lawyer talk. 
[02:56:00]  Can't piss or shit on the air.  What if it's in the bathroom?  Can't mic it.  Can't describe it.  Why can't you describe it?  That's FCC.  That's FCC.  It's not the FCC.  We don't have to be FCC compliant.  It's the company's policy.  Why?  What the fuck?  It's in the bathroom.  You can't describe...  We can describe a fucking beheading but not shitting?  Here.  You're not an asshole.  Why are they making the same mistakes regular radio did?  Don't these people realize what fucking killed regular radio?  Why would you do the same thing to satellite radio?  Holy shit.  Why wouldn't you avoid all that bullshit they put their fucking radio shows through? 
[02:56:30]  I don't get it.  Why can't you describe a fucking bowel movement?  Holy fucking shit.  Go get that explanation right now.  Tell him I want his tie so I can shit on it.  That is fucking mind bending.  Make the same mistakes regular radio made.  Why would you do that?  Why would you make the same mistakes regular radio did?  Regular radio is a disaster for all this. 
[02:57:00]  It fucking sucks because they allowed lawyers to fuck it up.  They allowed these fucking lawyers to fuck up regular radio.  So there's no FCC really for satellite radio and you can't describe a bowel movement.  That can't be possible.  That might be their own policy.  That doesn't break any...  It is their own policy.  For what reason though?  It's an XL channel.  It's an adult channel.  Yeah.  We even have like...  Yeah.  We have that in place.  I don't understand.  We're an XL channel so you know you're going to hear some stuff that's a little crazier than 
[02:57:30]  the other channels.  You just explain what that girl's fucking pussy look like.  Exactly.  So how can you explain what a pussy looks like but not what number two looks like?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  Number two.  You can say shit until they take that away from us.  Yeah.  I don't get that.  I'm a pretty level-headed guy.  You're not a level-headed guy.  Like Frankenstein.  Exactly.  I'm not even close to it.  You guys attacked Iraq like he made the rule. 
[02:58:00]  He walked in here.  I know.  He looked like he was like, holy fuck, I'm just relaying a message.  And a lot of dating questions coming in with God.  They're all just inquisitive.  Dennis in Staten Island.  Dennis?  Listen, I really hate to interrupt this shit fight, but my question is, will Ace Rothstein  be wearing his glasses tonight so he can peruse the menu?  Will you bring your reading glasses tonight?  No, I don't need reading glasses.  I occasionally put them on when I'm home alone to look at, like, if I'm going to be looking 
[02:58:30]  at small print for a long period of time, but I don't need them when I'm out to look  at a menu.  Jesus.  All right, here comes Iraq.  Fuckers.  Iraq's coming back.  I was going to sit there the whole time.  What the fuck did I do?  All right.  Fuck you, Rich Voss.  Excuse me.  What was you saying?  Iraq, go ahead.  I hate her fucking entourage.  Yeah.  What a body.  Teala Tequila, what a body she has, man.  Wow. 
[02:59:00]  Is that her?  Dude, she's wearing a shirt.  Kenny, get her on the show so we can beat her up.  No.  Her skirt is, like, this short.  Yeah.  Where the fuck is she?  No.  Let's bring her on so we can fuck everything up today.  Iraq, what's your, uh, what did you find out?  All right, this is what I was told.  It is the, uh, company's policy.  We can do things that are offensive, we just can't do things that are obscene.  Um, that includes insertion, bodily fluids, and such.  Do you know obscenity has never been defined as far as the Supreme Court goes? 
[02:59:30]  Oh.  It just hasn't been defined.  Carlin did it?  No.  No.  Obscenity hasn't been defined.  No one, by the way, let me, let me, let me tell you this.  This is another thing.  Um, yeah, there's obscenity, uh, and then there's indecency.  Indecency is allowed.  Indecency on regular radio is not allowed.  Obscenity is not allowed on either.  Do you realize that nobody, I believe, in the history of radio has ever been fined or fired 
[03:00:00]  or called out by the FCC for obscenity.  They have for indecency.  We've all been, you know, fined and had our pee-pee smacked for indecency.  But as far as obscenity, no, it's never happened.  It's just never happened.  So what the fuck is everybody so scared for?  Why would you make the same mistakes?  That's my headline today.  Don't make the same mistakes regular radio did. 
[03:00:30]  Holy shit.  There's more obscenity going on in the closed office fucking doors with the suit and ties,  man.  Man.  I saw Jimmy Graham with a mic.  Man.  They're the real obscene ones.  War is obscene.  Shitting into a bucket is not.  No, it's obscene, man.  What the suits are doing to our show.  Man. 
[03:01:00]  That's obscene.  Stupid suits.  Stupid suits.  Oh, you're changing since you met this girl.  Fucking Pacific Northwest hippie asshole.  I want to smell your cock before and after the date.  I want to just hold it under my nose like a fake mustache.  Yeah, can we go old school?  What?  We all want to sniff your fingers tomorrow.  That's not asking for much.  If it doesn't just smell like Brazilian barbecue, I guess so.  Yeah, not his fingers.  I won't know if she has a great pussy or if that's actually honey glazed ham.  Are you going to try to close your deal tonight or do you want a relationship out of it? 
[03:01:30]  Are you going to play it by ear?  It doesn't need a relationship.  I don't want a relationship.  Not even with her?  Like you wouldn't have?  No.  She lives in L.A.  Okay.  And what do I want a relationship for?  I'm going out to dinner.  She lives in L.A. and she's going back when?  Like Thursday.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, what?  Yeah, this is perfect.  Listen, Dr. Steve's on the line.  Dr. Steve.  Sorry, Dr. Steve.  I insulted you before. 
[03:02:00]  Yes?  I called you gay.  I called you gay.  You didn't hear all the insults we've had for you the last couple days, have you?  What?  Who?  Jimmy?  Yes, I apologize.  Bobby Hill, 30 years in the future.  Well, I have to hurt my feelings.  Bobby Hill, yeah.  Is that Joe Torre sitting there with all those senators?  I've been eating a lot of peanuts and stuff.  Are they going to rot through my stomach?  I can't.  I hope so.  Call for this.  No, no, no.  You'll be fine.  Because I'm trying to cut out sugar.  You'll be fine. 
[03:02:30]  Why are you calling, Dr. Steve?  Well, you know, you were talking about the vicinity thing.  When we did the diabetes urine tasting challenge, I started negotiations with the suits three months ahead of time.  All right.  Months.  And so I got really well-versed in their reasons for it.  And what they're worried about, and if any of it makes any sense, this is what they're worried about, is that satellite radio hits the whole United States.  And there are some jurisdictions like, well, let's just say rural Alabama somewhere, where you've got a prosecutor that wants to make a name for himself. 
[03:03:00]  He hears something that he deems is obscene and sues the company.  But why couldn't he do that with just HBO or any other pay service that isn't available to everybody?  Explain that, Dr. Steve.  Well, because they're not doing excrement either.  I mean, you know, showing fecal matter and, you know, swirling down a bowl or something like that. 
[03:03:30]  He might do it.  But, you know, what they're looking at is things like, you know, excrement and insertion and those kinds of things are considered a quote-unquote obscene.  And that's what they're worried about is some lawyer, some prosecutor out there, some DA that wants to make a name for himself and sue the company.  Now, my encounter to that was that, how would that be bad for Syrians?  Yeah, exactly.  But, you know, they think it would be bad. 
[03:04:00]  Now, I have people calling my show and describing their bowel movements all the time.  But, you know, it's in a clinical setting, I guess.  Maybe that's the difference.  The bottom line is that they're allowing these fucking pariah lawyers or the possibility of one of these fucking pariahs to wreck it.  But, and meanwhile, I'm going to take a shit or I'm going to take a piss.  I'm going to record it and I'm going to bring it in.  Yes.  Why not?  And then I'm going to dump water into a toilet.  I'm going to say it's piss and you be the judge. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, shit.  You're of the mind.  Well, I'll play it on my show.  Well, I mean, you get away with it because no one's really listening to your show.  Oh.  It's all about how big your audience is.  I love Dr. Steve's show.  Dr. Steve is great.  We're on the, we're the bullseye of the radar and you're, you know, just off the screen.  I understand.  I get it.  I get it.  Hey, Dr. Steve.  I actually love Dr. Steve's show.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Do you get nervous when you meet Dr. Dean Adele?  Hey, he was my inspiration. 
[03:05:00]  I got to be honest with you.  What does that mean, Rich?  He's a bigger radio doctor.  I think Dr. Dean did a great job at the time.  You're doing doctor radio guy bits?  He's the only one doing them.  No, he's not a doctor radio guy.  Holy shit.  I think she looked fucking good.  So let's get her in here and beat the shit out of her.  I want to beat the shit out of her.  She looks good.  I'm going to beat her up.  I'm going to beat her up.  That's not her.  It's a publicist.  Then we'll get in trouble with the publicist.  Let's beat her up.  Oh, I can't.  She's an easy target.  I don't want to beat up a chick.  And the bottom line is, it's not her.  It's a publicist.  It's never the artist.  It's a publicist.  We want to hear a fucking publicist story. 
[03:05:30]  Last week when I was doing Joy, fucking, you know how you sit in the green room and  on screen you see who's taping before you?  Fucking Carol Burnett was there.  And I wanted to do everything to get her.  And some publicist goes, email me.  Really?  You weren't able to meet Carol Burnett?  No, I couldn't even get to her.  They surrounded her like fucking all these.  You're a comic.  You should be able to.  But they're douchebags.  Any fucking comic.  What the fuck is wrong?  The comic should have been able to.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Just showing you.  Listen, I didn't want to take a picture with her, dummy.  I didn't want to. 
[03:06:00]  Why don't you say hello to her?  I got a picture with her because I went over at XM at Jazz at Lincoln Center.  I mean, you went over.  And Bruce, our old buddy, took very good care of me.  And she was very sweet.  And the people around her were nice.  They were very, very pleasant.  Because you weren't asking her to be in a movie.  You were taking a picture.  But she is fucking.  Why didn't you just say hi?  Hi, Ms. Burnett.  But you're a fucking one of the funniest people ever.  And then ask her.  And then say, look, my wife and I are doing this thing about women.  It was.  Steve, I think everyone forgot about you.  Why didn't you walk up and just say hello to her? 
[03:06:30]  I couldn't.  Yeah, Rich.  What's that?  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, we forgot about you on the phone.  We're talking about publicists.  No, I.  I said, yeah, Rich.  I could talk to this guy, Dr. Steve, forever, man.  Can we get Carol Burnett in here?  I would love to talk to her.  Rich has a question for you, Dr. Steve.  Tell him.  Which one?  The one you were telling us during the break.  Oh, that one?  Yeah, you got a doctor on the phone now.  Go ahead.  Well, the good thing is I've had MRIs. 
[03:07:00]  I've had all kinds of CAT scans and everything.  Everything's normal on the inside, right?  The cysts on my kidney, they say that's normal, even though it's the size of a baseball.  He said it's not cancerous or anything.  Are they going to get rid of it?  No, the first time they did drain it.  Then I went to a new, what do you call it?  Doctor?  Yeah, I forget what kind.  Urologist, urologist.  No, it was a specialist.  And he said, I don't know why the first guy drained it.  Don't even tell me why, Dr. Steve, because it will get me nervous. 
[03:07:30]  But there's nothing wrong with them.  And I didn't have a question at all.  All I know is I've taken MRIs from my brain, nothing there.  And CAT scans, my lungs are good.  So I just want to say that I feel good.  What can that giant cyst on his kidneys be?  How did you guys let that line go?  I said it all too late.  Rich said it on purpose.  Yeah.  And then I waited too long and said, you can say that again.  No, tell them.  A little too late.  It's all about timing.  Adults, if you get over a certain age, you get cysts on your kidneys. 
[03:08:00]  Some people do.  No, you don't.  Yeah, you do.  Dr. Steve?  Yeah.  Please tell them.  This is a cyst on your kidney, Rich.  That's what I'm having trouble.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can get those.  They're completely benign.  Yeah.  They're just, they're filled with fluid and you can pretty much ignore it.  A lot of people have.  Now, there are some people that will get a lot of.  Dr. Steve, isn't that the secret ingredient of your wine?  A drained kidney cyst.  Just a touch. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  Squash through a leprosy toe.  Helps the bouquet.  Wine joke.  Yes.  Dr. Steve has wine.  Is it on the market?  Why would it be?  Yes.  Dr. Steve's wine.  It's on the black market.  It's called Little Peas.  I'm sober.  It's good for Molotov cocktails.  It's what they use to keep the kidney fresh before they put it in someone's body.  He delivers it like they did at the end of fucking a Bronx tale.  Right. 
[03:09:00]  But he makes a great wine label.  Amazing.  Your wine labels are amazing, Dr. Steve.  Thank you.  Is there radiation in, hold on.  Wait.  Is there radiation in MRIs or just in CAT scans?  Oh, my God.  Radiation?  Is that what you said?  Yes.  Okay.  Now, look.  There's radiation and there's radiation.  In an MRI, the radiation is microwaves, whereas in CAT scan, they use X-rays.  And it's felt that the X-rays in the CAT scan are much more likely to cause problems down the road than the microwaves in the MRI. 
[03:09:30]  So, in theory, the MRI is safer.  What's the risk of a CAT scan?  And it's probably one in 1,000 people will have some long-term, down-the-road, 20 years down-the-road problem from having a CAT scan.  So, that means that your odds are great that you get two or three, four CAT scans in your life and never have a problem with it. 
[03:10:00]  But, if you multiply one in 1,000 out times 350 million people in a certain, you know, sizable fraction of those getting CAT scans, you're talking about, you know, a few thousand solid tumors 20 years from now that, you know, could have been prevented.  But, you know, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  In 20 years, I don't care.  I'll be fucking 72.  There you go.  I'm going to start smoking again at 65.  That's good, Rich.  I always said that, too.  Are you done with Dr. Steve? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  Can't you talk to a doctor forever?  No.  Oh, my God.  They're boring as shit and just scary.  Are you crazy?  You don't have to fuck?  How much information?  How much do you want to talk to a doctor forever?  You want to ask him questions?  No, I don't want to know.  You want to just pepper him with questions.  I thought you were supposed to get a complete everything.  I'm going to.  He's been â€“ I want to get my executive physical.  The executive?  Jerry.  All right, Dr. Steve.  Bye, Dr. Steve.  Always a pleasure.  Physical without the belt.  Weirdmedicine.com, right?  Yep. 
[03:11:00]  Drsteve.com.  Thank you.  Drsteve.com.  I'm sorry.  All right.  All right.  There he goes.  Dr. Steve, everybody.  All right.  We should take a break, Ant.  You know.  Yeah.  Why don't we do that?  We'll get some more questions about your big date for the listeners.  Can I fill my fees out real quick?  Yeah.  I'm in Poughkeepsie this weekend at Bananas.  And at the end of the month, April 29th and May 1st, Motley's in Boston.  Motley's Comic Club, Boston Mass.  I want a lot of â€“  Did I show you this?  The George Brett thing?  He already had it.  Oh, he had it?  Ah, look at this. 
[03:11:30]  Me and Travis got a match today.  Going to play George Brett going into the break.  Did you get your plug in, Rich?  Yeah, you got it.  You did get it in?  Yeah.  All right.  Then this.  Right side.  Back to the right.  Both hands.  Right side.  Pardon.  To the left side.  I shit my pants last night.  I did.  Went out and had a great meal.  Just a great fucking meal.  I had to go to the bathroom so bad in the car.  I'm going, travel.  Hurry up.  I got to shit.  I had fucking shit in my pants.  I'm good twice a year for that. 
[03:12:00]  When was the last time you shit your pants?  Me?  Yeah.  Been a while?  Yeah, it's been a while.  I was in Vegas a couple years ago.  Just an honest to God, true story.  Staying at the Bellagio.  I went over to the Mirage for dinner.  Met some friends of mine over there.  Went to Kokomo.  It's a great little steakhouse.  The guy brings out some fresh crab legs.  He just came in.  I got to give them to you guys.  I'm eating them.  Then we go play gamble a little bit.  I had a tea time early in the morning.  So I said, look, I got to get going.  I'm walking back to the hotel. 
[03:12:30]  I get three quarters of the way out of the lobby.  All of a sudden, I go, oh, fuck.  And I'm standing here like this.  I got my butt pinched so fucking...  I'm fucked.  I can't move.  All of a sudden, you know, felt all right.  I went just like this.  Water.  I had some food poisoning from the crabs.  Take off my leather jacket.  Tied it around my waist.  I'm just standing there, and it's just running down my leg.  I got jeans on, black bucks. 
[03:13:00]  No socks.  And I just start fucking walking.  Every time I'm walking, something's coming out.  It's water.  Straight fucking water.  Then, to tell you how sick I was, to tell you how sick I was,  then I'm standing outside, and I got my cell phone, and I called the guy.  I said, Larry, you won't believe this.  I'm standing outside the fucking Bellagio.  I can't move.  I got shit everywhere.  I shit all over myself.  And Larry's about a 48 waist.  So he brings me over a pair of pants and some towels and some towels.  And so then he comes over, and he meets me. 
[03:13:30]  I tell him where I'm standing.  He finds the closest bathroom.  When you go up the escalator, you go into the fucking...  I can't get in the elevator.  It's come o'clock at night.  So he goes in.  He finds the closest bathroom in a lobby of the hotel.  And then I get in the escalator, and he kind of pretends like he dropped something,  so no one gets behind me, tells me where it is.  I go in there.  He goes and gets the towel all wet for me, throws it over the fucking stall.  I take off all my fucking clothes, just wipe off, leave my shoes.  Left my shoes, my pants, everything right there. 
[03:14:00]  The towels right there in the stall.  And I'm walking barefoot with my shirt and his pants that are 48 waist through the lobby like this.  It's midnight.  Got up in the morning, took the most perfect double-tapered shit I've ever had in my life.  True story.  Who's the pitchers in this game?  Fantastic.  Logan Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.

[03:21:00]  April 29th and the 30th.  Go to richvoss.com.  Hopefully all your dates are up there.  Right, Rich?  Yeah.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Where's E-Rock?  We got another shitty lawyer update.  E-Rock.  So, we're trying to...  I don't know.  I threw it out there as a goof  but I would actually do  a diarrhea contest with a few people  if they were willing  to eat a few burgers with me.  Eh, problem.  And so far,  I know we got two or three  that would do that  and then we went to the lawyers  and they're basically saying  no fucking way  because Jimmy wanted  two listeners to come in, 
[03:21:30]  eat something that would cause  liquid diarrhea,  explosive diarrhea  and then they would have to be  back to back  as they're shitting into buckets.  Back to back.  That's horrible.  It is hilarious  but the lawyers already  shut that down  and now you got another update?  Well, because I was  trying to figure out how,  you know,  in certain comedy pieces  or whatever,  you can play somebody  like blasting into a toilet  or you can play a clip  of somebody peeing  into a toilet.  Yeah.  They said that 
[03:22:00]  even that's treading a line  but you're allowed to  because it's accenting  a comedy piece  and you're not really  describing what's going on.  So, that's okay  but if you have somebody  actually doing it live  and you're describing  that they're sitting  over a bucket  taking a shit  and the company  would not allow that  to be a contest anyway.  I got a question.  Will your father  send me a new putter?  I've been through  about five or six  in the last three years.  I told him that your dad  sent me a driver. 
[03:22:30]  His dad is like golf smith.  I asked his father  to send us a son  who isn't retarded.  What's that?  All right.  Sorry, you're on.  So, there's that  and then I was told  about vomiting  in the studio now.  That's treading another line  because it's...  They're going to take  vomiting away from us too?  It borderlines  excreting fluids.  Shit.  Why don't they  fucking stop?  This is all the stuff  that wrecked regular radio.  Why are they going to  make the same mistakes? 
[03:23:00]  We've let the lawyers  do it.  Good job.  What about crying?  Yeah, that's fluid.  Vomiting is one of our  best bits lately.  Yeah.  I had no idea  but that was just...  Never have Bob Kelly on.  Why would there be  a problem with vomiting?  We've been doing it  for years  and no one has  piped up at all.  No one said anything.  Yeah.  No one has said anything.  No one has ever said  anything bad about it.  They didn't say  we couldn't  but it was brought up  that it's also  treading a line.  That's their way  of going,  look,  we're allowing you guys  to do some stuff  so don't get too pissed off. 
[03:23:30]  They're a little uptight.  Why won't they  fucking do the radio show?  I don't give them any ideas.  I don't really.  Those are nice sneakers.  Ah, you're laughing  at his sneakers, right?  What kind are those?  These are Nike Jordan.  Aren't those for ball players?  Like they're basketball sneakers, right?  Yeah.  Neil Armstrong's.  They're nice.  They look like moon boots.  Huh?  I just did a rich boss.  I explained it right after.  I didn't get it. 
[03:24:00]  Those are great.  Wow, that's great.  The boss has a pair.  I know.  Those are nice.  So when they hint  that the vomiting is,  that means they're taking  that away too  because that's how they do it.  They didn't say no.  They didn't say we couldn't do it.  Trust me.  It was brought up.  Trust me.  How do you stop someone  from vomiting,  especially someone like Bobby  who just,  we don't even know sometimes  we'll do something  and he'll just start puking.  It's terrible.  Jesus Christ.  Yes, Danny.  Those jism trees 
[03:24:30]  are everywhere.  I didn't realize that.  I thought they were just kind of  isolated,  but they are all over the place.  Because of Bobby,  wherever I go,  I smell jism.  It's funny.  It's true.  I always thought it smelled  like something else  until he brought to our attention.  They are all over your neighborhood.  The other day I was driving  and I was like,  oh my God,  I smell gum everywhere.  I smell jism tree.  And I'm driving home  and like just every street  is just lined.  Yeah.  With those trees.  I'm like,  holy shit,  they're everywhere.  What the fuck?  All right,  why don't we,  well, 
[03:25:00]  fuck that.  All right.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  We'll have to censor the puking.  We'll have to just put beeps in.  What?  The only way to fight back  is for listeners  to write in and complain.  That's the only way  because at least they know  their audience  who pays is listening.  If there's something bothering you,  they're paying for something  a little different.  So what are they getting  different than regular radio?  Us saying fuck?  Who cares?  And pussy farts. 
[03:25:30]  Who cares?  And cunt hat?  No one has ever complained.  What are they paying for?  No one's ever complained  about vomiting  on the show.  You say something?  Even on regular radio.  No one ever complained about it.  Yeah.  So why just start fucking  making up rules  before the powers that be  make you adhere to theirs?  I don't know.  You can't even do like  a good,  like bulimic bit.  What bit?  A bulimic or something.  You can't get them in now.  I can't take it anymore. 
[03:26:00]  It's not your show.  Oh, you're right.  You come in here  once in a while.  You know what the deal is.  If you only knew  what we had to deal with  to do this fun show  that should be the easiest  fucking job in America.  It's mind boggling.  Yeah.  They take things away from us  that no one has ever complained about,  even on regular radio.  Do you know that people  have been doing vomiting bits  since we started  in radio together?  And we've been on  a million markets  at one time, 
[03:26:30]  so they can't even use  that as an excuse.  It's because no one's complained.  No one's like  filed any FCC things.  So the lawyers for the company  sit there and go,  uh-oh.  You know,  they're going to start  looking around and realizing  they don't need  this many lawyers.  Let's make shit up  so we can keep  our stupid jobs.  So they just make up books  and pass them down  to the people down the hall  and go,  oh,  oh,  okay,  here's something new.  The lawyers have determined  that vomiting  or this is bad  and we shouldn't do this anymore.  They put out a memo.  Good.  Well, 
[03:27:00]  let's pay them  because now they're working.  Just fire them.  Do you ever meet  with the people  that say no to bits?  I don't even,  if a lawyer walked  past me right now,  I wouldn't even know.  They smell like shit.  So your argument  has to go through  an agent to them  or you can't even  have the argument with them?  but most of the time  it's between us.  And who?  You and who?  A program director?  There's a couple  of people down there.  Oh.  I just yelled,  I'm sorry.  Is it the argument  where you go,  I can't believe  you really think this  or I can't believe 
[03:27:30]  you're saying this?  Like you can't,  the argument  where you don't have  a chance  and it's resinked.  Yeah,  you just know  there are times  where you just  don't have  a fucking  the old  snowball's  chance in hell.  Jimmy's leaving  the studio.  Rich Voss is leaving  the studio  for a photo  with Tila Tequila.  We said no to her.  It's Miss Tila now.  Tila Tequila.  It's not Tila Tequila,  it's Miss Tila.  Doing a lot of radio  today here at SiriusXM.  We passed on her  because we're not allowed  to ask certain questions.  Trying to drag her 
[03:28:00]  out of there  and there.  Tila Tequila.  Let me see  what she'll look like.  Please say no to Jimmy.  There she is.  Please say no to Jimmy.  Oh, she's got a  she's got a little  purple thing on.  You can see her ass  right through that  by the way.  With Tila Tequila  in the rich house.  Who's the same height  as Tila Tequila?  Tila's hands are bigger  than Rich's.  Yeah.  Alright, and there she goes.  You can see her ass  right through that.  She's got a little  see-through skirt on.  That's not bad,  but you know what?  She's not right. 
[03:28:30]  She gives a shit.  What happened?  Did you fart  while you were  getting your picture taken?  Who farted?  A-Rog, what happened?  Everyone's walking in  laughing.  What happened?  Alright, so Jim  takes his photo.  It's very nice.  Rich goes over  and he's like,  oh great.  Leans over  and he's holding her  and then just goes  it's so loud  that everyone heard it  but Rich is still  holding her  so she can't move  away from the photo.  And then she  pushes off 
[03:29:00]  and she goes  what was that?  And there are people  like, oh I don't know  what that was.  Jimmy's dying.  Somebody in her party  walked around  and he goes  I think he farted.  Jimmy, can you hear  the fart?  Dude, I'm surprised  you didn't hear the fart.  I couldn't believe.  By the way,  she's wearing a thong.  She's not naked underneath.  Yeah, yeah,  she's got a thong on.  But Rich farted  really loud?  Dude, it was literally  this, it was dead  silent 
[03:29:30]  and he went  wait  it was like that.  It was loud  and wet.  Did you feel her  twitch a little bit?  Best part is  And obviously  you did that on purpose  Rich, right?  It wasn't an old man thing.  Rich won't let her go.  Rich kept holding off.  Oh, is that  fucking perfect?  God damn  Voss rules.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:30:00]  Jimmy's still dying.  I couldn't believe  I had no idea  you were going to do that.  I literally had no idea  you were going to do that.  I almost walked back  in the studio  while you got your picture  but I'm like  I'm just waiting  for my camera.  Oh my god.  That's great.  Did you snap the picture  before or after  the fart?  During.  It was during  because I want to see  if her face shows up  like maybe she  she's making a face.  Oh, that's great.  No, you can't see.  She's just smiling.  But Voss looks like  he's pushing one out. 
[03:30:30]  How you do?  Oh my god.  God damn, man.  You had your hand  around her waist.  Tight or what?  Yeah, I just touched  her back.  Going on there.  Yeah, she's got  a great little body.  She's sexy, dude.  I didn't even get  to look at her really.  I wasn't paying  attention.  Farting on her.  You don't even know  who she is, right, Rich?  Yeah, she was a bisexual  or something.  Huh?  Tenny was loud?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Dude, it was literally  Tenny, there was no one  talking.  No, it was classic 
[03:31:00]  because they go  Jim Norton wants  to take a photo.  She goes, oh, okay.  She was nice.  And Rich Voss,  she goes, nice to meet you.  He grabs her  and then farts  right on her.  Dude, I can't believe  you just did that.  It was literally  it was this loud.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe  I feel  52 years old.  You can't fucking  roll, man. 
[03:31:30]  You know we'll get  in trouble for that, too.  You know that, right?  Especially,  thank God it wasn't  Jimmy because there  would be some issue.  Can you please  not fart on the guests?  You know,  some dumb thing.  Oh, no farting  on the guests.  It's going to be  the next prerequisite.  Oh, fuck, Grinch.  Thanks for the laugh.  Holy shit.  Holy fuck,  is that great.  All right.  Hey, Danny.  What is a Wendy  Williams today?  She looks like a lion.  A lioness.  She looks like a maniac.  Look at her eyes.  She does look  like a maniac.  Courage. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  She has a frog face  or something.  Does it look like  a frog?  Something.  Fuck.  She looks like  a California raisin  in a wig.  Danny,  what's his mom  yelling and screaming  at her kid all about?  Oh, this is great.  It's good.  Yeah, apparently  some kid,  he's trying to launch  his own sports drink  like Red Bull style  with a whole bunch  of caffeine  and his mom  is pissed off  that he's trying  to do it in the house  and she gets mad  when he leaves  the cases and bottles  around  upstairs  like he's only  supposed to keep  all this stuff 
[03:32:30]  in the basement  so they go away  on vacation  and he decides  to pull a prank  on his mom  and just have  something ridiculous  like 20,000 cases  shipped over  and he just stacks  them up all around  the house  and the living room,  the kitchen,  the dining room,  everywhere,  sets up cameras  and then waits  for his mom  to come home  from this trip  that she was on  and she was not pleased.  You should see my house.  You should see this.  Oh, fuck.  I can't believe it. 
[03:33:00]  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it!  I can't believe it!  Christ! 
[03:33:30]  I can't see it!  I can't see it!  I can't see it!  Shut the camera and go upstairs.  Oh, my God! Please!  What did you do?  Get out! Get out!  Oh, my God!  Get out!  I can't take it!  I can't take it!  I can't take it!  I can't take it!  I can't take this!  I can't take this! 
[03:34:00]  I can't take this!  Well, what are you doing?  I don't know what to do!  Oh, my God!  How can you do this to us?  How can you do this?  Where's her china?  I can't take it!  I can't take it!  Oh, my God!  Wait!  Where's her china?  I can't take it!  I can't!  I can't!  Just be quiet!  Just cut the mirror!  Slow down!  Come on! 
[03:34:30]  I can't!  I can't!  I love it, but it's fake!  Holy shit!  It's fake!  I really don't want it to be because it's really good!  It's fake!  I love it, but it's fake!  Because his acting sucks!  Is that the husband?  Yeah!  They're getting the name of this energy drink out there if this goes viral, right?  Not really!  It's got 1600 views!  1600!  Oh, okay!  Then maybe it's not fake!  I like it!  No, I'm not saying it's bad!  It's an epic nervous breakdown caused by Vital Energy on YouTube! 
[03:35:00]  It's a fake!  It's gotta be!  It's a commercial!  You think?  Of course!  She comes home and there's just cases and cases of this new energy drink all over the  house!  It's fake!  All over the house!  Are people saying fake on the comments?  Fake, fake!  Let me go part two!  Let's listen!  Okay!  Mike, move out!  Please move out!  We...  Move out!  I can't stand this!  I cannot stand this!  I cannot stand this!  I'll give you this to me!  It's on to you! 
[03:35:30]  It's on!  I'll give you two of this to me!  What?!  I just want you out!  I want these drinks gone!  Fuck this!  Oh!  You'll be so disrespectful!  This is my house!  I've worked my own life for this!  I've worked my own life for this!  Get the hell out of here!  Get the hell out of here!  We're in the night tonight.  No!  Yes, we are. We're getting it out of here.  I can't stand it out.  We're getting it out of here tonight.  I can't stand what you did.  I know. I know. 
[03:36:00]  Get out. Just get out.  I know.  Get out of here.  Mom, I'll get out. I'll get out.  But I just want to tell you, it's on camera.  The whole thing is on camera.  We're getting it out tonight.  I can't get it.  I have a little work tomorrow.  I know. It's coming out tonight.  It'll take us.  It's not going to take more than an hour.  I promise it didn't take that long.  I'm not sure.  She married a Bonnie? 
[03:36:30]  How would he get so many cases, by the way?  It's not like a huge company.  It's obviously the guy who started the company.  If that's real, it might be fake, but if that's real, what a cunt.  It might be a little of both.  He knew that he could surprise his mom,  and then the video would go viral.  You know what I mean?  It's real from him.  Her, it's a real reaction.  Like him, it's fake.  So he decided, you know what? 
[03:37:00]  I got this energy fucking drink company.  We're talking about it now, right?  And so surprise his mom, videotapes it,  and now everyone knows about the energy drink.  But the husband or the dad sounded a little fake.  Maybe he was in on it.  Maybe he was in on it and she wasn't.  Because he said this is being filmed,  so now he has her permission.  I don't think the mother would sue.  What, are you kidding me?  She wants to own the company.  You don't come from a family where moms sue their kids.  Look at that.  No. 
[03:37:30]  I don't think it makes the house look that bad.  What?  It doesn't look bad.  It's a new type of fucking paneling.  I can't follow a fart.  I'm done.  You gave us the moment of the day, though.  That's great.  I can't fucking follow that, man.  It almost blew that little skinny bitch over.  What are they saying?  What did Liam say, Jimmy?  He said that they weren't even sure what it was.  It was fine.  It was just a silly moment.  I wasn't sure what it was.  Meaning, like, they...  Yeah.  It sounded like a fart,  but no one probably thought that a grown-up farted. 
[03:38:00]  Not like that, no.  While taking a photo.  During a photo op.  They're like, he...  This guy's been on television, hasn't he?  Yeah.  He didn't just come over and fart.  He's a parent.  Oh, jeez.  He's a grandparent of a small African-American child.  What, you're a grandparent now?  Who's that?  Oh, fuck.  Steve and MJ had their son.  I got to congratulate them on their baby boy.  Steve's a father. 
[03:38:30]  That's right.  Yes.  That's right.  Very cute boy.  Came out of nowhere, but Steve...  Young Xander.  No, it came out of nowhere.  It didn't come out of nowhere.  Well, no.  It came out of nowhere,  because they had a little time to go,  and then boom, you know.  How much time was left?  It was only the third month.  It was a very, very cute baby, too.  I saw the photo.  It's a very cute baby.  Yeah, Xander.  So happy...  Congratulations to Steve.  Xander Carleesi?  Yeah.  Steve and MJ.  You have to...  You can't type a congratulations.  You have to copy-paste the X at the beginning of the name.  Yeah, because...  No, for him, he would think it was because of the Z.  The Z, right. 
[03:39:00]  Xander's with an X.  That's kind of a cool name.  It's completely original.  Yeah.  Nothing bad.  I think that if best names all start with C, guys.  All right, what's this...  Wow, we're struggling.  I don't feel that way.  I think that the trailer for the New Turk February film is out.  Oh, what?  Oh.  Hey, what's the movie that you did with Brooke Shields  and Paul Creece and stuff? 
[03:39:30]  Furry Vengeance?  I saw a commercial for that.  Furry Vengeance.  That's coming out very soon.  Who's the star of it?  Brendan Fraser and Brooke Shields.  There's a lot of people in it, though.  Kenji Yong's in it, and I guess not a lot of people.  Three.  Brooke Shields is in it?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  She's a big box office show.  I remember Blue Lagoon.  She made...  Brooke was actually really funny, though.  I know, I heard.  She made fun of my posture.  She was mocking me.  She's like, how do you stand like that?  Wow, really?  Yeah, but she was like a real fucking...  She's like a guy.  She just shit talks, and she...  Really?  She's fun, man.  That's pretty cool.  She's extremely accessible. 
[03:40:00]  And I got a photo of her making fun of my fucking shit posture.  If I can find it, I'll show her.  Oh, you have so many pictures of you and celebrities, Jimmy.  I know.  My goodness.  You keep them all on your phone?  Most of them.  Just to show people?  Yeah, not all of them.  Do you put them on your computer, too?  Oh, computer first.  Your phone fucks up?  Computer first.  And then you got a hard copy, I'm sure, right?  Only the one...  Nah, something.  Hey, can you back up these iPhones on a PC?  Oh, my God. 
[03:40:30]  No, I know you can't on a PC.  Oh, my God.  Here we go.  More tech talk.  We're too tired.  We can't do more tech talk.  Tech talk.  Yeah.  It's been as much as we can.  You absolutely can back up your...  On a PC?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, as long as you have iTunes.  Ooh.  I have it so much.  Yeah, I got it.  But it's a pain in the ass trying to figure it out, right?  It's a big thing.  No, it's not that big a thing.  iTunes is pretty easy.  You know, there's a search feature.  I lost a lot of songs.  When you lost a lot of songs?  On my iTunes, the ones that I fucking didn't pay for. 
[03:41:00]  Like, oh, it's just a mess.  I really wish I had somebody to spend a day with me.  Let me say it again.  She's beautiful, Brooke.  That woman who was yelling at that fucking kid sounds mentally ill.  Can I just tell you?  Oh, yeah.  I fucking hate mentally ill people.  I really do.  You should be fucking put down.  Yeah.  I just can't...  Because their self-centeredness, their fucking self-obsession in their own little shit world.  That's screaming.  Oh, it's fucking enraging. 
[03:41:30]  I've heard that screaming.  Oh, it's fucking...  It's like you crazy bitch.  Crazy, right?  Bitch, shut your fucking mouth.  I've heard those screams.  You can't hear that.  I've heard those screams.  That's what made me think it was real because I know what that sounds like.  I think she was real.  I've heard those screams.  Yeah.  It was the father that threw me off.  I'm like, I think he's acting.  Well, so you're saying that all...  So he might have been put up to it by the son.  Mentally ill people are a pain in it.  You don't like them?  They're the fucking worst. 
[03:42:00]  Hold on.  They're the worst.  Let me get DeRose on the phone.  I want you to tell him.  He's not that bad.  What are you trying to find?  Because they're just self-obsessed.  I fucking despise their self-obsession.  I loathe it.  Despise.  Despise.  They fucking hate it.  They're fucking perpetual victimization.  They're fucking whinging.  Shut your fucking mouth.  Take a pill and stick your fucking head into a fucking gas tank. 
[03:42:30]  You fucking annoying burdens.  Well, there's some people that have problems with anxiety or depression.  I'm not talking about anxiety.  Anxiety.  I can't even say it like that.  Anxiety.  Anxiety.  Anxiety.  Anxiety.  Anxiety.  The ex was taken away from me in my voice.  But some people that have that, which is a mental disorder, get through it.  I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about people who are truly mentally ill who just â€“ they're so enragingly unaware 
[03:43:00]  of what annoying bags of shit they are.  I'm not even â€“ I'm dead serious.  And I'm not talking about people that are fucking â€“ I have anxiety.  I'm an addict.  I'm kind of nutty.  But people who are so self-obsessed and their self-obsession makes me fucking hate them in  a way I can't even describe.  Can you not hold your chest like Jack Benny when you're talking, please?  Hold on.  Let me get another reference from 1907.  Oh, look.  Are you talking old references all day long?  Shut up.  Dude.  Jack Benny is an â€“ that's an old reference. 
[03:43:30]  It's an old reference.  That's a bad one, man.  And Jimmy has passion about what he's talking about.  But people with that kind of illness don't know they have it.  I don't care.  So they should be allowed to fucking ruin everyone's lives around them because they're  not aware of it?  I'm tired of hearing it.  So what are you saying?  Put them on an island?  Yes.  Whatever.  Whatever it takes.  Yes.  Keep everyone else healthy.  All they do is â€“  Sacrifice one to keep everyone else healthy.  How about the people that come back from fucking war that have mental illnesses?  But we're obviously not talking about them. 
[03:44:00]  Paul, you can't draw â€“ mental illness is mental illness.  No, it's not.  No.  I'm talking about people â€“  A guy who has shell shock is a little different than somebody who's just self-obsessed and  has absolutely no true ability to see themselves.  I don't hate a guy who's shell shocked.  I have empathy for that.  But somebody â€“ these self-obsessed people who just don't understand what they really  are and they're perpetual victims.  Me.  Me.  Me.  So I guess â€“  Just fucking die. 
[03:44:30]  So you would basically say that to the Genovese guy that used to walk around in a robe?  No, because I don't believe that he was truly mentally ill.  I think he was smart.  He was a smart guy.  Not the Genovese guy.  The Genovese guy.  The guy from Rite Aid.  The guy from Genovese.  Yeah.  Was Dwayne Reed a mafia guy?  He wore a robe.  Yeah, he was.  Was he at war with Walgreens?  Yeah, no.  And it's on here!  King Cullen.  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall. 
[03:45:00]  My mistake.  I thought the ball was gone, but apparently not.  No, it wasn't.  King Cullen.  Jesus Christ.  You went from there to Great Eastern?  A.M.P.  She's making a good point, this Jimmy Norton.  I don't agree with that.  Do you got some mental illness in your family?  You're just the worst.  No, yeah.  Me.  I'm not talking about that, though, dude.  I know what you're talking about.  You're talking about...  You're just a self-centered ass in the middle of the day.  You know what I'm talking about?  The people that may are conscious and all that fucking walk the streets.  Rich, you're self-aware that you might have some mental issues. 
[03:45:30]  That's very different.  There are people out there that are not self-aware.  They don't understand that they're fucking a major fucking problem for everybody around them.  All they do is fucking burden everybody in their lives around them.  And they want to be treated equal.  But they don't understand that everybody around them begins to hate their fucking guts.  And they isolate everybody.  And they sit there and they feel victimized.  Why does everybody...  Shut up! 
[03:46:00]  Shut your fucking mouth!  You fucking annoying burden!  Shut up!  Either take your fucking medication or throw yourself through a window.  Don't kill yourself.  Just throw yourself through a first floor window.  So you lay there and look stupid.  You look all stupid.  You assholes.  With some cuts, bruises.  Exactly.  And you pick your burden self up off the linoleum.  Self-centered bags of shit. 
[03:46:30]  God, that passion.  Me!  Me!  Me!  Me, me, me, me.  If you could fucking...  That passion and emotion.  If you could fucking bring that out in one of your acting roles, you'd be fucking great.  You should see me acting...  I'll try it a little later today.  I'm doing some good acting.  That's why you connect with that.  Go back to that fucking emotion.  Yeah, go back to that today, Jimmy.  I'm telling you.  I don't need to for the scene I'm doing today. 
[03:47:00]  Really?  What are you going to do?  Just fucking...  What do you mean?  Just talk?  Talk?  No acting?  No, I don't actually have to talk in this scene.  I have to...  This part of the scene that we're shooting today is strictly action.  And my partner, one of the co-stars in The Wire, actually has the dialogue.  I read for that show.  Exactly.  And if I did a read, they told me.  Thank you.  Did they really?  Oh, Jesus.  What word did you fuck up? 
[03:47:30]  I just...  Oh.  What?  Me.  Me.  Me.  Oh, I fucking...  Just the way they're so wrapped up in their own fucking dog shit.  They're so fucking wrapped up in their own fucking shit.  No one gives a fuck.  Shut the fuck up. 
[03:48:00]  Holy...  We all got fucking problems.  You fucking burdens.  And you know who you are.  There's so many of you.  You know who you are.  You fucking annoying motherfuckers.  But me.  No, no, no, no, no, me.  No, no, me. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, you should have been fucking aborted.  Oh, you fucking...  Some people in our country have a lack of perception and a self-obsession and delusions of grandeur.  It just...  I want to bite their faces and go, no one thinks of you.  No one. 
[03:49:00]  Jimmy, you're not a fan of the ones that are not capable of understanding what they're doing to the people around them?  Dude, I fucking despise the ones who have no understanding of how everyone around them leaves them.  Everyone walks away from you.  See, Jimmy and I might have had a conversation on the way home yesterday.  That is now part of the radio show.  And they don't say, they don't say, God, I am an overbearing intrusion into every area of every person's life that I touch. 
[03:49:30]  Never would they say that.  Never.  It's never, I am the problem.  I am a fucking burden who contributes nothing.  Not even an inkling?  Never.  Not even an inkling?  If you wrote it down to them, if you said it to them, you might as well say, hey, are you a blimp pilot?  They would have the same perception of piloting a fucking blimp as they do into what absolute burdens and annoyances they are. 
[03:50:00]  And how people around them, everyone around them, everyone, friends, boyfriends, guys that have fucked them once, chicks that have blown them once, fucking uncles that met them once at a party all want to go, shut your fucking mouth.  It's a constant burden to be around them with, there's no fun. 
[03:50:30]  There's a pall over the room when they're in there, right?  They're a thick smoke.  Yeah.  The smoke that would happen if you filled a barrel of shit and lit it.  Can we ask questions?  That thick fucking smoke.  Can I ask a question?  Sure.  You're not a fan of the people that make it about themselves?  I fucking.  It's always about them?  They make my stomach hurt because their self-importance, when they contribute almost nothing to anybody around them, is why I fucking hate them. 
[03:51:00]  And there's so many of them that exist.  There's so many like that.  It could be a big day for you personally, but they make it about themselves?  All about them.  Are you a fan of that?  My name is Zicky Dender.  But today is not about you.  It was supposed to be about me.  But I'm hurting.  But it was my 12th birthday.  Why is it about you?  Exactly.  Or it's my fucking, my anniversary or my, whatever the occasion may be.  But why are we getting into this now? 
[03:51:30]  But Daryl, why are you talking about the people?  It was my wedding.  I don't.  It was my wedding.  Why are we getting into this now?  This had nothing to do with you.  I just fucking need to interject their utter worthlessness into everyone's affairs around them.  And no matter how much they talk, nobody will give a fuck.  I'd like to sit them all down in a room and go, there's a reason you're alone.  Nobody gives a fuck about you. 
[03:52:00]  Do you think that's a coincidence that everyone around you walks away?  Do you really think that everyone just came to that same conclusion for no reason?  Or perhaps you are a toxic fucking shit cloud.  Not even at that point, they don't even go, wow, it must be about, it must be something I did.  Not a clue.  Never.  Even when it gets to that point, they don't go, wow, it must be something I did. 
[03:52:30]  I'm alone here.  Never.  Never?  They have no idea.  You think they're aware of the big, huge fucking black cloud that follows them everywhere?  They have no idea how everyone around them looks at them like, oh, we were hoping you would die in your sleep.  They have no idea when they're walking around the neighborhood, everyone has to grab an umbrella because of the black cloud.  What they don't realize is when they walk around the neighborhood, nobody fucking thinks of them.  Nobody. 
[03:53:00]  Nobody looks at them.  Nobody thinks of them.  But in their head, everybody's thinking about them.  Oh, everyone is talking about them and wondering about them and being curious about them.  Hate to explain it to you.  Nobody fucking thinks of you ever.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  It is exactly the way it is. 
[03:53:30]  They're fucking self-obsessed.  I'm not saying I don't make judgment errors or make fucking perception errors about myself.  I don't have the most accurate picture, but I have enough of a grasp to know when people around me hate my fucking guts.  Are they capable of understanding the problems they have caused around them?  No, they have no concept because they're victims, always victim, which is me. 
[03:54:00]  But I wasn't different.  And how about life and the way I'm hurting?  No one fucking cares.  It's April.  We're all paying taxes, you burdened shitbags.  You should have been fucking hangers.  You should have been in a fucking toxic waste bag in the fucking back of a Planned Parenthood.  Jimmy, we got some phone calls coming in. 
[03:54:30]  Greg in Staten Island.  Greg.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hello, Greg.  Yeah, a friend of mine.  No, not me.  It was actually me.  I had to play a rocket ball, and my own partner knocked four of my front teeth out in one shot, right?  So I pull up, have to go out to the dentist, and my freaking mother, who, like, after I had my teeth surgically re-implanted in my head, which didn't even take, by the way,  my mother doesn't want me to go anywhere after that because, you know, she had a rough day. 
[03:55:00]  You had four teeth knocked out.  I'll help you out.  And your mom made it about her and her bad day.  Yeah, it was her bad day.  Exactly.  It's never about you.  People's...  You never get the spotlight.  Does she always have the spotlight?  Oh, his mom, I'm sure she does.  Whoever it is, it's like we all have these people in our lives.  And you want that spotlight maybe to shine on you one lousy fucking day of your life.  His mom should because she has teeth.  Nobody wants to look at him.  There's people who have... 
[03:55:30]  They just don't understand how they are...  Kinison said emotional tampons.  And they don't understand how they fucking bleed everyone around them.  And they are struck down in terrified loneliness, as certain 12-step friends of mine say.  And they wonder why.  And it's because your lack of perception about yourself.  You don't know when to shut the fuck up.  What do they see when they look at themselves in a mirror? 
[03:56:00]  Victim!  Me!  Hurt!  Hurt!  How they be wronged!  Everybody wrongs me.  Not even a clue that they're the problem.  Not even a clue that people don't wrong you.  They react to you because you're shit.  They react.  They're repelled by you.  Like you're a greasy substance and people are water.  And they go... 
[03:56:30]  And they roll away from you.  No understanding.  Because you're a draining slug.  You're a fucking emotional slug.  Not even a hint of understanding.  Not even...  Dude, no inkling.  And then people would go, you should feel bad for them.  I would if they were struck by a car.  And as I was urinating on their wounds, I would go, wow, that looks like it burns.  Well, look at them reaching once again, like they did in life when they were healthy.  Reaching to take, to bleed, people dry, to victimize themselves. 
[03:57:00]  Let's go to Jeff.  Back on.  Jeff from Massachusetts.  Jeff.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi, Jeff.  Jimmy, I said the same thing almost word for word the other day watching Hoarders.  Those people are the most...  Absolutely, dude.  Yes.  All these people are spending their whole day trying to help them clean the house out.  And they're running around going, don't throw this out.  And they have to...  Dude, the way they have to treat the people at home...  Now, we should really look at this and see if you really need it. 
[03:57:30]  Well, it was my aunt's.  And when she died, she left me all alone.  And this is what I have to remember.  Yeah, it's just some fucking powder puff from 1950.  And they can't throw it away.  And they got to coddle them and be like, it's okay.  All right, all the cleaning crew, leave the house.  We have to talk now.  It's like, how about you just throw her shit away as she's in the fetal position in the corner  until the place is clean and go, there.  Now it's clean.  How about this?  You leave them. 
[03:58:00]  You leave them.  Sit there in your own fucking waste alone and die that way.  You don't fucking...  They don't want to be helped.  Fuck them.  Jimmy, how do you feel about the people that give you the call for help?  Look, if it's sincere, that's what...  If people really want help, I don't mind helping.  I'm not even crazy people.  I'm talking about people who will just sit there in their own fucking sewage energy and  feel bad for themselves. 
[03:58:30]  And they wonder why everyone in their life is repelled by them.  And that's why.  And they don't fucking know it.  So what are they waiting for?  I don't know.  And I don't care.  What are they waiting for?  What do they want from us?  They want us to fucking hold them and make me better.  Make me better.  I don't care if you're better.  Don't give a fuck.  Pay my taxes.  Pay my taxes or my mortgage.  That'd help, right?  Whatever fucking human pile of shit you are. 
[03:59:00]  Quid pro quo.  I'm taking your shit.  How about you help me out a little bit?  Is this a personal thing?  No, I'm just saying in general.  We might have had a talk in my home yesterday.  I'm going through some things.  We all fucking...  A lot of us are going through some things.  Yes, everyone goes through things.  Every person goes through things.  Now, if this person, nameless, faceless person, all of a sudden,  to enter this room, what would happen?  For all of us, it's different.  We all have many people like that.  But I would imagine you just want to sit them down and go,  you're fucking worthless to me. 
[03:59:30]  Because you have made yourself worthless to me.  Would they take all the energy out of the room?  You're just a drain.  You say the same fucking shit.  Day in and day out.  And nobody gives a fuck.  And you don't get that nobody fucking cares.  Shut the fuck up.  I think we covered it.  I'm trying to think.  Yeah.  They don't get it, brother.  I've never been that deluded about my effect on other... 
[04:00:00]  I've never fucking...  You're speaking my language today, my friend.  ...leached on like that.  And everyone deals with it in their lives throughout our whole lives.  We all have it.  You're speaking my fucking language.  Speaking my language.  They just don't fucking understand.  Don't you hate the saying they did the best they could with the tools they had?  Don't you hate that?  No.  And I don't even disagree with that.  But at times that's not enough.  Because I don't care if they did the best they could.  I don't agree with that.  Sometimes I do.  But that's at least acknowledging like... 
[04:00:30]  Jimmy's talking about the people that have no fucking clue.  There are people with mental illness that will say something like that.  And they go, look, I did the best I could.  But I really did have issues.  And I know what my issues are.  And I know I'm working on my issues.  That's not the person he's talking about.  Yeah, I'm not talking about...  Even that's a little rough.  But he's talking about the one that's not even self...  Nowhere's near self-aware.  Burdens.  What they're doing to everybody around them.  Burdens.  Who wonder...  They wonder why everyone leaves them.  And they wonder why everyone walks away from them. 
[04:01:00]  And that's why.  Yeah, but I have no friends.  And I got...  They left...  You never had any friends to leave you.  You've always been an awkward Jew in a black neighborhood.  Even around white people.  And I've repeated myself.  Now I feel like I can't do this stuff.  When you say...  Hold me for...  I'm getting nervous.  Because, you know, like when you say burdens...  Like, what are you talking about?  People that you've got to take care of for the rest of you?  Oh, boy.  I don't understand.  Oh, boy.  When I say burdens, do you mean Richard? 
[04:01:30]  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  I'm just trying to fucking get you going.  God damn it, Jimmy.  Oh, God bless you.  It's the lack of understanding that I hate them for.  Yeah, but you're not in your fucking head.  I don't want to be in the head.  That's the issue.  I don't give a fuck.  I heard recently that someone told me this.  That they were incapable of understanding the wrong they do. 
[04:02:00]  Ah.  Incapable of understanding.  Then I guess the solution would be for them to fucking go in a room and never talk to anybody.  Because, again, you're right.  I'm not in their heads.  But you know what?  I have no interest in being in their heads.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't care.  I don't empathize.  I don't sympathize.  I don't give a shit.  And just being on the opposite, isn't that self-centered, though? 
[04:02:30]  If it was somebody close to you, you would care?  If it was somebody close to me, I would do what everybody in their lives has probably done, and that's walk away from them.  Just walk away.  Because, again, their lack of perception makes me not give a shit why they feel the way they do, why they're sad.  I don't give a fuck.  But some people are incapable of understanding what they do to others.  Then, again, there's one solution.  Lock themselves in a room and talk to no one until they understand that they are alone because of who they are. 
[04:03:00]  They're alone because of the way they behave.  They behave.  Wow, you hit a nerve with a lot of people.  Everyone deals with them.  A lot of people have someone like this in their lives.  Sure they do.  Multiple.  And we're talking to people.  We're talking to that type of person right now.  You don't know it.  There's that type of person listening.  There's that type of person experiencing it.  There's every facet of it.  Yes.  Every facet of it.  Yes. 
[04:03:30]  All right.  That's great.  Whoa.  Richie Voss, get your plugs in, buddy.  You did a good job.  Yeah.  Great job, Rich.  Always got a meeting.  The fart thing was classic and a lot of the other thing.  The tech talk earlier was classic.  If you're just tuning in, the replay today is going to be a good one.  Friday.  It really is.  Ignore the first ten minutes.  We had some technical problems, but we got through it faster than usual and moved on with a fine radio show today for everybody.  All right.  This Friday and Saturday, Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then April 29th, 30th, and May 1st at Motley's Comedy Club, Boston. 
[04:04:00]  All right.  Cool.  Great city.  I want a nice big fucking turnout.  I want to sell out the room.  It's only 13 seats.  All right.  So the end of April, beginning of May.  God, that felt good.  Fucking Motley's.  Holy fuck, man.  That felt fucking great.  I got it.  By the way, if you said that to a person in a room, the type of loser I'm talking about would not be affected by that.  That is not about the other person. 
[04:04:30]  That is about me or you, the individual who feels that way.  Because the person who is intruding or leeching, they don't care either.  So that would mean nothing to them.  Of course.  So I don't think that by saying that or any of us saying that about anybody would change a fucking thing.  I am with you, brother.  Because the type of fucking piece of shit that I'm talking about will never be changed and they will never, ever understand.  They wouldn't understand that you were just talking about them. 
[04:05:00]  No, they would.  But they would somehow make it look like they were not the problem.  You were, bucko.  But you're insane for saying that type of thing.  But what you're talking about is just a complete self-centered person.  You don't have to be crazy to be that self-centered.  Yes, you do.  To be that self-centered.  It's called, there's like all kinds of terms for it.  I mean, yes, you do.  Really?  I think you got to be a little nutty.  I think you do.  Or if you're not crazy, then you're just garbage.  If you're crazy, at least you're crazy and a burden.  If you're not crazy, then you're just complete shit. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah.  Did you change Rich Voss' Facebook page?  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Why?  Words coming in?  Why?  I don't know.  A lot of people just checking in.  I'm just wondering for the show.  I don't think so.  How is that even possible?  Okay, I wasn't.  It's just the status of what Jimmy, because Jimmy was on there.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, what's the status say?  The status.  That he was a faggot.  Oh.  And it was just queen-sized bed.  That's all.  What the fuck happened to my page now?  Nothing.  I can't fix it.  I'll just fucking erase Facebook. 
[04:06:00]  I don't give a fuck.  The whole Facebook, the whole thing?  The whole company.  I'm going to fucking take my Etch-A-Sketch and go side down.  Is it all fucked up again?  No, it's exactly as you left it.  Just the faggot one.  It's the, he calls you a faggot thing.  Yeah, so what are you saying?  There's a link to your faggot page.  I was just asking, because a lot of people are noticing.  They're all checking out your Facebook right now, Rich.  Oh, you're fucked.  You guys fucked me up somehow.  Oh, he looks a little old there.  Wow.  Who does?  Are you banks left?  Wow.  I knew that we should.  Oh, you're dead.  Why is he leaving? 
[04:06:30]  Honestly, he's like 52.  There's no bad blood.  I think he just wants to go out and do gigs and stuff.  I think he did a Tonight Show since like 94.  He just wants to go out and do gigs.  Wow, man.  After fucking Jake fights back his...  Well, I think that's why he waited.  I think he was going to leave earlier, but he waited until Jay was back on.  All right.  Why don't we get out of here?  We got meetings to do today.  Why don't you get...  Yeah.  We got a gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta meeting today.  I gotta sleep.  Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta.  Put in a word for our friend, too.  I will.  It doesn't mean shit, though.  Nothing means shit around here.  The week that I'm in Boston, I think I want to come back in in two weeks. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah, Boston's a great problem.  Great city.  I'll be in Pittsburgh coming up and Seattle.  I had to cancel Florida.  I apologize to the Marco Island people.  Oh, my God.  But it's because I'm shooting this episode for HBO.  It's just, it's shoot date.  There's nothing I could do, so I apologize.  But it's being rescheduled.  You'll be back there.  Boy, that's nice to have the fucking just say I had to cancel.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Yeah.  That's good for you.  Especially for a shoot.  Yeah.  It's one of the, dude, I gotta fucking cancel, you know, it's like, well, whatever.  It's like fucking, you know how it is.  Monday, I'm supposed to do Red Eye, right? 
[04:07:30]  Yeah, but I can't because I gotta do Leno's and I gotta go to the Red Eye, right?  Jesus, look at you.  What are you doing, Leno?  Just, I'm doing the round table thing on Monday.  This coming Monday?  I am with, yeah.  Good gym.  Fucking A.  All right, guys.  Sensation.  Ron and Fez up next, right?  The great Ron and Fez.  Yes.  And Rich Voss.  What about him?  The great Rich Voss?  Oh.  Rich Voss was right on the fucking mark today.  Always.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  I bet he's dumb.  I'm not dumb. 
[04:08:00]  I'm very smart.  I raised three, two and a half, two and a tenth kids.  Thank you.  Thank you. </pre>
