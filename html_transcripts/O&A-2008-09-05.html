<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a lively discussion surrounding the Republican National Convention.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with in-studio guests Bob Kelly and comedian Jimmy Norton, dissected the speeches of John McCain, Barack Obama, and Sarah Palin, comparing their styles to musical acts and focusing heavily on the appearances of Cindy and Sarah Palin, with Opie expressing attraction to Cindy McCain.  Numerous polls were analyzed, and caller reactions, including dreams about Cindy McCain and expressions of attraction to Sarah Palin, fueled discussions about the appearances of female political figures and societal pressures on their attire.  A contentious interview with Bradley Jacobs, senior editor of *Us Weekly*, regarding their controversial Sarah Palin cover, “Babies, Lies, and Scandals,” provided ample comedic fodder.

The show took a dramatic turn with a chaotic studio incident involving Eastside Dave, a guest from another radio show.  Dave's display of tattoos culminated in a digestive emergency, resulting in nudity, vomiting, a contaminated newspaper featuring a nude picture of him, and a near injury to E-Rock, a staff member, who was chased and collided with a security door, later visiting the ER and facing an odd interrogation from a nurse about domestic abuse.  Master Poe, a martial artist,  mistook Dave's actions and karate-kicked him in the gut, further escalating the situation and causing a flurry of panicked calls to supervisors and HR.  This incident was interspersed with discussions about Sam Roberts' upcoming birthday, a planned “What’s the Haps” segment featuring Sam’s reports from the RNC (including an interview with a Grim Reaper protester and Keith Olbermann's response to a 9/11 video montage at the convention), and Anthony Cumia's recent breakup with Jill Nicolini, inadvertently revealed by Bob Kelly, leading to the announcement of Anthony's planned 24-hour webcam show with multiple women in lingerie.  A phone interview with Scotty at the RNC discussing a "participatory democracy experiment" performance piece called "Revolutionary Love 2" led to a debate on the word "queer."  An interview with Charlie, the Grim Reaper protester, followed, with further commentary on the RNC and New York City protests.  This was followed by a segment on the New England Patriots and a news segment delivered by Big A and Roland, marked by Big A's pronounced stuttering. The news included an MLB instant replay controversy, a man killing his kitten, Jesse Jackson's hospitalization, a fatal assault, and an upcoming hurricane.  A caller named Marissa was challenged to sing "Consider Yourself" from *Oliver!* resulting in a humorous, albeit uncomfortable, segment.  The show included a surprise birthday call from Mick Foley, who discussed his departure from WWE, citing Vince McMahon's directing style, his TNA debut, and a failed reality TV show pilot.

The later portion of the broadcast focused on Sam's birthday celebration, beginning with a "cake farting" stunt involving Amy, who farted on cakes, leading to sexually suggestive conversations with the hosts and other guests, including stand-up comedian Heather Height.  Pat Duffy's participation in the stunt escalated the vulgarity with the addition of the "Russian Broad" or "Cake Fart Girl,"  resulting in physical and verbal altercations, including Duffy's beard and testicles being pulled, him receiving a kick to the groin, and extensive discussion of a cake imprinted with female genitalia.  The volatile interaction between Duffy and the "Russian Broad" was a dominant feature, interjected with discussions of Duffy's personal life, a policy regarding guests with disabilities (due to a cancelled appearance by Master Poe), and a collection taken for Duffy.  The show concluded with the "line of the day" announcement. The broadcast consistently used offensive language throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And we're pulling out of the driveway.  Take a look to the left.  Take a look to the right.  Do we look left again?  Of course we do.  And then we make the right turn.  We are on the road.  Just go for it.  Step on the gas with the Opian Anthony Show.  Hi.  Good morning.  Bye, buddy. 
[00:00:30]  Where do we begin today?  That was the big convention, I guess.  That was pretty big.  Big story.  Yeah, the speeches are on way too late, though.  What are they doing?  I don't know, but you're right.  I think they think they're available. 
[00:01:00]  To everybody.  You can go online and get them.  So it's not like if you missed it, you're not going to see it.  That's what we did.  Yeah, I mean, we have to get up for a morning show.  But the regular Joes out there, they still have to kind of go to bed early as well.  Yeah.  These speeches starting at 10 o'clock is kind of crazy.  I think you get a much bigger TV audience if you go at 9, right?  They're trying to do West and East Coast together.  Oh, maybe that's what they're doing?  Jimmy, look at you with the logic.  That makes a lot of sense, actually. 
[00:01:30]  Ooh.  Yes.  McCain came across as a very nice guy yesterday.  He did?  I thought so.  He's a lovable guy.  You just want to tussle his hair.  Oh.  So did a few Southeast Asians.  Bamboo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, come here, you.  Oh.  He's one of those guys.  The whole thing is BS. 
[00:02:00]  Do you think they look stronger than they do?  Like when Obama was speaking last week, he looked unbeatable.  But then you saw...  Obama blows him away on a stage.  I mean, what he's saying might be complete BS, but his presentation is pretty amazing.  You know?  Well, it's kind of seeing some of these bands and their stage shows, wow, but they only  have one hit song.  Yeah.  Obama might be that type of guy.  One hit wonder?  Yeah.  And McCain has like a whole library of songs, but the stage show isn't that great. 
[00:02:30]  Repertoire.  He decided to go with just the basic setup, you know?  But you know the hits.  Yeah, you know the hits.  I don't know.  It did look terrible with just that stark blue background when they zoomed in on him.  I guess there was a flag flying in the background and some other stuff, but all you could see  when they did the tight shot on him was a blue background, which leads me to believe there  is going to be a lot of funny McCain videos put together because you could just key that  blue out and put him in any situation whatsoever. 
[00:03:00]  Any situation you want.  Yeah.  Drop McCain into some scene.  Yeah.  He did well.  He stumbles a lot.  He's not the greatest speaker, but that doesn't mean he can't be the president.  You know, Obama is smooth.  Sarah Palin was smooth.  Yeah.  Joe Biden was pretty smooth.  He has his issues, Biden, occasionally.  Yeah.  But, yeah, McCain, it's not like a guy you're compelled to sit down and listen to what he's 
[00:03:30]  saying.  You know, Obama people seem to really want to hear what he's saying.  And McCain, it's like, all right, here comes the politician.  Oh, come here, you.  Yeah.  Oh, the old curmudgeon.  I don't know what's wrong with me, though, man, because I'm starting to fall for Cindy  McCain.  Yeah, you're really, like, every time she comes on camera, it's like, wow, that Cindy  McCain is a good-looking woman.  And no one wants to acknowledge her in the office, because I'm just trying to get someone  on my side.  I'm like, wow, that's Cindy McCain. 
[00:04:00]  I don't know what's going on with me.  Yeah.  Getting these weird feelings every time she gets on.  Weird feelings.  Every time she's on TV.  And no one wants to, like, bite and join me on the Cindy McCain, she might be hot train.  She looks weird.  There's something.  It's not.  You know what it is?  It depends on what color she's wearing.  This is one of the stones.  Because the one we're looking at, what?  She looks like one of the Rolling Stones?  It depends on, I've studied this.  Like, the picture we're looking at right now, she looks like an old lady, because her really 
[00:04:30]  blonde hair looks like it could be white hair.  But then she wears different colors, and then her blue eyes start us sparkling, and I don't  know.  There's something about her.  What can I tell you?  She's obviously up there in years.  Yeah.  But she's kind of holding herself together.  But you can kind of see it below that necklace.  That's where you see it.  On the neck.  Yeah.  She's kind of her, her.  Wow, that's an awful picture.  She's got short hair. 
[00:05:00]  Well, that's just in a bun, bro.  Oh, it's in a bun?  Oh, come on.  That's another thing.  She's never had short hair.  That's something Palin's got to do.  She's got to change that hair.  She's got that big friggin' beehive thing on her head.  They're praising our hairdo.  Are they?  Yeah.  Who's they?  They're, they're, they're.  What are the gays saying?  No.  No, they're the ones that, no, they're the ones when they come out and say, you know,  hey, here's what it is about her hair.  Like, I don't, what am I, an expert? 
[00:05:30]  Maybe you're right.  We need gay guys.  Maybe you're right.  Because the headline goes, new look, a glam slam.  A glam slam.  Not many straight guys saying, glam slam.  Did anyone call it fabulous?  Sure sign.  They were saying that she looked great from, like, the top of her head to the waist, but  then below the waist, it just gets yucky.  Sarah Palin won style points for updating from an Audrey Hepburn below to a Paul Abdul above.  So they're, so they're saying her hairdo's a lot like Paul Abdul. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, Abdul is a dog, though.  Just don't go from Audrey to Catherine.  Yeah.  For one night, hockey mom Sarah Palin went from school marmish grand to subtly sophisticated  glam.  Thanks to a makeover, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, they had to make her, make her over.  Yeah.  This whole process, I'm telling you, is just a bunch of crap.  It is something. 
[00:06:30]  Well, what do they, what do they say, the polls now even, pretty much, the poll that  came out?  Well, shouldn't McCain have a much bigger lead because it's like the Republicans weak?  Don't, don't, shouldn't they get a nice push because it's all about rah, rah Republicans  this week?  Well, I think you've got to wait and see what happens.  You know, it was just on last night, so they've got to do a new poll.  Now, I know you're.  You see people that went, oh, I watched them last night.  I said no in the last poll, but this one, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, there was an eight-point bounce for Obama after their convention, and we'll know 
[00:07:00]  Saturday or Sunday if there's a bounce for this.  Yeah, we'll see, but.  The two biggest applause points last night were nothing about policy.  It was when he mentioned Sarah Palin, and then when she walked out, the place erupted.  Yeah, I'm starting to think that I don't give a crap who the next president is.  I really don't.  I don't care if it's Obama.  I don't care if it's McCain.  I mean, I just like the process, and I like how ridiculous it is.  Ridiculous.  I mean, at one point, McCain goes, and I can't wait to introduce Sarah Palin to Washington. 
[00:07:30]  That's good.  Yeah.  You're going to introduce the vice president to Washington.  Who's this broad?  Well, let me introduce you.  You may not know her.  She had to have at least visited Washington.  She must have went on at least one of those school trips that we all go on when we're growing  up, right?  Or, you know, try to get some cash.  The governors go every year.  There's a governor's conference.  They meet with the president.  They meet with the vice president in the Congress, who she's been there twice.  Yeah, but they don't get the super duper VIP pass, my friend. 
[00:08:00]  And dude, unless it's an alphabetical order of the state, she's at the end of the line.  She ain't shaking hands first with the president.  Yeah, no.  No.  No, there's a lot of places she can't go when she went down there.  Oh, your pass only gets you this far.  Yeah, she's got one of those passes that we get when we go to concerts.  Hey, it's all access.  We can get back here.  No.  No.  What?  But it says all.  Oh.  Well, there's four stages of backstage passes.  Ah.  We got the worst one.  We got the worst one?  Because you're Opie and Anthony, and no one respects you. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, no.  Even though you've been in this town for well over 10 years now.  Everyone.  Well, thank you very much.  Everyone has a laminate, but Sarah's got a wristband.  Yeah.  She can't get back here.  No, she's got one of those pukk-kunks.  A stamp on the hand.  Pukk-kunks on her hand.  And she's licking it and then trying to rub it on a friend's hand.  Right.  Hey, here we go.  Here's my brothers.  Only one, though.  Steve, New York.  What's up? 
[00:09:00]  Hey, what's going on, man?  Listen, I think this is probably just because I'm consuming way too much media, too much MSNBC  and all, but I had a dream about Cindy McCain the other night.  Dude, I'm willing to jump on board with you.  She's hot for an older lady.  Yeah, well.  Yeah, I'm not saying I want to have, like, sex with her or anything.  She's just giving me some feelings that I'm a little confused about because she is an older woman.  I think it brings me back to when I used to caddy for the old broads and I used to kind of get turned on a little bit. 
[00:09:30]  Mrs. Jones, I'm watching you.  Because he's old broads.  You're a tramp.  You're a tramp.  You know the old broads were playing golf because their husbands were working hard and they wore their little golf skirts.  And you're thinking, yeah, yeah, yeah, why not?  There used to be a caddy that, you know what, huh?  He went way past why not and was doing.  Oh, really?  Doing not.  Yeah.  It's probably a good way to get killed if you're a caddy and you're doing these wives. 
[00:10:00]  No kidding.  Some of those guys.  My club was a mafia club, too.  Not too smart.  You're not supposed to really say it like that.  I love the mafia.  You're supposed to just say, ah, a few of the good fellas that come in.  You know, because they're good fellas.  I'm a big fan of the mafia.  I have no problem admitting it.  Yeah.  They always treated me and my brothers very, very well.  All on the up and up, by the way.  Yeah.  The biggest tippers and just took care of us in general.  That's great. 
[00:10:30]  And I have no problem admitting that.  Now go get your golf bag.  I'll tell you who I hate it.  Better not say it.  Didn't begin with a G, did it?  A G.  No.  G.  Yeah.  G-O.  No, no.  You know.  What?  G-O-T.  G-O-T.  John Gotti.  Do you hate John Gotti?  Is that what you were saying?  You were crazy.  Jesus.  I actually didn't get that. 
[00:11:00]  I think he was talking about nationality.  Oh.  Or group.  Oh, yeah.  No, Gotti ruled, man.  I thought you were talking about.  He knew how to take care of his neighborhood and he had fine entertainment for everybody.  Absolutely.  Let's go to Darren in Jersey.  Darren.  Maybe not for everybody.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  What's up?  I have an odd attraction to the Alaska Governor Palin.  I just want to see her doing dirty, dirty things.  I don't know why.  She has struck a nerve in a lot of the guys in this country. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they see her and just want to have some kind of, want to see her naked.  Here's the nerve.  She's the only bangable vice presidential candidate in the history of our nation.  Absolutely.  It's a hell of a way to put it.  Ferraro.  You're right.  I believe the only other female.  Just awful.  Oh, yeah.  An awful head of man hair.  Horrid.  Yeah.  Right, right, right. 
[00:12:00]  She's like a male Supreme Court justice.  At least you don't have to look at her driver's license to make sure she's a female.  You can just tell.  Yeah.  Some of these other broads they've thrown at us.  You're like, what is that?  Let me look at your driver's license.  But she's got to ace that pantsuit thing, that skirt, jacket, politician, every woman wears thing.  Get rid of it.  Blouse, skirt, blouse, unbutton a bit, sexy, like a bra underneath.  I'm not even.  A little cleavage.  Yeah, you know something? 
[00:12:30]  I'm not talking, go put on the full slut here.  I'm not talking that.  But you're a woman, obviously.  You don't have to just gussy yourself up.  I think it's all these stupid organizations like NOW and these women's groups that just bash it into these women's heads that if they're going to be in this business that is predominantly run and employs men, whatever the business is, that you've got to kind of dress like a man? 
[00:13:00]  What the hell is that about?  Just put on a skirt.  Let's see some gams.  She should dress like a high school.  Cheerleader?  French teacher.  What?  High school French teacher.  That's her look.  Speak French?  They all used to dress sexy in my school.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Blouses, boobies, some of that nice French scent.  Scent?  Whatever it is, you just knew it was fancy in French.  I never took French, so. 
[00:13:30]  And a skirt with nice, what are they called?  Stems?  Yeah, nice gams.  Gams.  Nice sticks.  She should dress like a high school French teacher.  I'm telling you.  Not too slutty, not too, it's right there.  Right there.  Yeah?  Yeah, the principal's not going to give you a problem dressing that way.  What if your French teacher was a man?  Now you can't relate.  Obviously, female French teacher.  Come on.  Come on!  All right, well, we only have two highlights from the McCain speech. 
[00:14:00]  Obama, we had a lot.  Sarah Palin, we had a lot.  McCain is just not that impressive on a stage.  No, he doesn't have that wow factor, does he?  I'm not saying, I'm not trashing him.  I'm just saying, you know, that's the obvious.  Out of the four biggies that spoke, he probably came in third or fourth place.  He came in fifth.  He's a bum.  He's not that exciting of a speaker.  And anyone else noticing yet that Rudy Giuliani is really full of himself? 
[00:14:30]  You know, he's in the paper today bragging how great he was.  Really?  Yeah.  And how his speech was well received.  Of course it was well received.  You're talking in front of Republicans.  What a dummy.  But he is full of himself.  Yeah.  Take a closer look at Rudy when he's on TV.  That guy thinks his you-know-what doesn't you-know-what.  The 9-11 thing that they did, what did they do, a little montage of terrorism over the years? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  That's nice.  Is that the little fear factor thing that they like doing at times?  Some people thought it was completely appropriate.  And guess what?  Other people thought it wasn't.  I wonder if that was across party lines.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Well, I got that.  Because then you got that blowhard Oberman losing his mind because they did a 9-11 video.  Oh, really?  Yes. 
[00:15:30]  But first, a couple clips of McCain's speech.  Really quick clips.  Tonight, I have a privilege given few Americans.  The privilege of accepting our party's nomination for President of the United States.  We are proud of it.  Oh, wait.  That's quite a privilege.  We needed to play that for everybody?  All right.  Of course we did.  That's the big, you know, thank you.  All right.  And then this.  I know these are tough times for many of you. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  You're worried about keeping...  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  His voice is that up front.  You want to hear a big just, USA, from like a whole crowd and you're hearing, USA.  Well...  What was that?  Well, there was a protester that, you know, we were talking about the protesters in the office.  Yeah.  I love the protesters at these things because I like to take myself inside the protester's 
[00:16:30]  body and you're sitting there at this convention and you start looking around, you know you're  going to be the protester guy and you're like, all right, I got to make my move.  You look around, you're like, you know what?  Looks pretty clear.  Looks pretty effing clear.  I don't see any problem.  I think I could get right to the stage.  Go for it.  And say what I need to say.  Go for it.  And then you stand up and start.  Yeah.  And within literally a foot, someone tackles you and you realize...  Yeah.  Wow.  ...that the place is covered with protection.  I thought you were a fellow protester. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  And then next thing you know, you're being dragged out and your genitalia is being shown  to everybody.  They don't care.  They don't care how they...  If your pants fall down.  Oh, they don't care how they get you out of there.  They're not going to help you pull your pants up.  It's like riding a bull.  You're like, you know, I think I can last...  I think I can last eight seconds here.  I can do this.  Bull starts and you're off the damn bull in a half a second.  Well, that's what this was all about.  And McCain, he handled it pretty well. 
[00:17:30]  Please.  My friends.  My dear friends.  Please.  Please don't be diverted by the ground noise and the static.  Uh-oh.  What do you mean by that?  Mwahaha.  Mwahaha.  Mwahaha.  He has a creepy laugh. 
[00:18:00]  This is McCain.  We should get a montage of his creepy laughs.  I don't know what that meant.  I don't...  It was a protester and they were distracted and...  I don't know.  What was the protester doing?  He meant to say background noise and he said ground noise.  Oh.  He left out words and sentences last night when he introduced Sarah Palin.  He said Governor Sarah.  Yeah.  Sarah.  What the hell was her name?  It did stop.  Sarah Palin.  Yeah.  And he cut off sentences.  But they...  Because he doesn't know if it's Palin or Palin.  It's Palin. 
[00:18:30]  It's Palina.  I think Palin is starting to win out.  I've heard it...  I've heard it both ways, though.  Well, they were yelling, Jim.  There were three protesters who yelled war statements at three different times.  And the minute they stood up and yelled, just like Opie said, they were tackled and  the whole crowd just started chanting, USA, USA.  Yeah.  I hate USA chants, even though I love the USA.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just a chant that's a little like...  I hate shirts that say USA on them with a rocket ship.  I get it. 
[00:19:00]  Just say here.  Yeah, like I am a member of the National Rifle Association.  Really?  Yeah.  You'd never know.  But I am.  And they send you catalogs all the time of some of their goods.  Yeah.  And I just, you know, I am a strong proponent of the Second Amendment and love my guns.  The NRA is a great lobby group for gun owners.  And even I look at their catalog and go, there's no way I would wear that. 
[00:19:30]  There's like this shirt.  It's just like red, white, and blue all over.  And it says NRA.  And then it says something like the Second Amendment, the original Homeland Security.  I'm like, I...  Okay, terrific.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand the meaning of it, but who's walking around with that shirt?  Could you bring in a catalog for next week?  Oh, sure.  Let's thumb through it.  I would love to.  Pats, little sayings on the shirts, and little granny bags that have holsters in them. 
[00:20:00]  Nice.  Do you get the NRA Wine Club flyers?  No.  I got that.  And I, of course, joined.  But it just doesn't make sense to me to have NRA and wine together.  But yet there it is.  Hey, drink.  Yeah, why not?  Why not?  And then they got the magazine, which I love.  I love Armed Citizen.  That's my favorite part.  It's a page that just has stories about how people thwarted crime with their legal guns. 
[00:20:30]  And it's nice.  You know, a lot of times it's like, 75-year-old Martha was asleep in her room when she heard a ruckus downstairs.  She grabbed her .357 Magnum out of the night table.  They just picture this translucent, bony hand wrapped around Dirty Harry's gun, walking downstairs, either shooting a bad guy or her stupid husband.  Not too weak to pull that trigger.  That's right.  Right, granny?  Oh, you've got to bring in the catalog.  Oh, yeah.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  We're off to a good start. 
[00:21:00]  It's a Friday, obviously, and usually we call it in.  But we decided today we're going to do a radio show.  That's what we do.  Damn it.  I thought we were calling it in.  Remind me to tell you my new patriotic line.  Oh, all right.  When we come back, Norton, we'll have that.  Speaking of protesters, we haven't gotten to this all week because we've been really busy.  But Sam did What's the Haps live from the Republican National Convention a few days back.  We're there.  We're in the middle of it.  We're sending our staff up to huge events like this.  And he talked to Charlie, who is dressed as the Grim Reaper. 
[00:21:30]  And that guy explains his outfit.  And you've got Luke.  And you've got Scotty.  And we meet CX9000.  Wow.  Is he the one that turns to liquid metal?  No.  Well, CX9000 is wearing a cardboard robot costume.  And he has something to protest.  I am awesome.  And let's try to get into this next.  Sam keeps saying that the audio is pretty good.  Also, Keith Olbermann just outraged over the 9-11 video. 
[00:22:00]  That blowhard.  He's angry.  And then we're going to tell other things.  But first, Ant needs a new family.  Ah, yes.  Let's play this one more time as we go to break.  I'm putting out an alert here.  I need a new brother and sister.  You've heard the rumors, and it's true.  Anthony Cumia of The Opie and Anthony Show is looking for a new family.  Because the ones that I used to have, they suck now.  They're no fun.  They don't hang out.  It's all about these goddamn children all the time. 
[00:22:30]  After being abandoned by his biological siblings,  who selfishly chose to procreate and form families of their own,  Anthony's taking applications for a new brother and sister.  Dude, it is so depressing.  They're all inside doing baby maintenance crap.  I need a new brother, Joe, and a new sister, Dawn.  Qualified candidates will be exposed to the following curriculum at the Cumia Estate.  Bench drinking, driving really fast, shooting firearms in the home,  frequent encounters with law enforcement, vomiting, diarrhea, gambling, 
[00:23:00]  lukewarm hot tubbing, mild infatuation with the World War II era,  notably Germany, specifically Hitler.  You've got to admit, snappy dressers.  So if you're between the ages of 18 and 19, have a slender build,  questionable judgment, loose moral fiber, and no interest in children  because children ruin everything.  Ow.  The goddamn babies are right.  Ow.  Then sign up today to be Anthony Cumia's new brother or sister.  And you need other things.  What?  You know, I can write it down. 
[00:23:30]  Rehab?  Wow.  Intervention?  Wow.  What's up, peeps?  Booyah!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show live from New York City  where the Yankees suck.  Yankees lost again last night, I believe, right?  Wow.  You guys are the Yankee fans.  Well, Jimmy's not anymore.  I was concentrating on Big Blue. 
[00:24:00]  Giants?  I'm a Jets fan, but Giants, yeah, you know.  Yeah.  I thought all the partying they did after the Super Bowl,  they would be blown out last night,  but they started off the NFL season in fine fashion, 16-7.  Yes, Anthony.  I'm just not really concentrating or caring about the hell the Yankees are doing.  And people say, oh, fair with a fan.  It's like, no, you know, I paid attention to the season.  They stunk up the field everywhere they went.  Well, they're seven and a half games out of the wild card.  Oh, jeez, sorry. 
[00:24:30]  I just saw some fat protester getting maced in the face.  Look at this, these idiot protesters.  Please just baton him.  Convention class.  They're running them over with their bicycles.  They're a woman or a man.  I don't know.  That's just it.  You can't tell with those disgusting protesters.  They look like McFoley.  Goddamn hippie.  He had a little McFoley to him, right?  So you've got the Yankees seven and a half games out of the wild card.  And I think there's 12 games left. 
[00:25:00]  How many games?  There's 20-some.  What?  20-some games left.  But they were down 7-0 last night and did score five runs in the ninth with another useless A-Rod Homer.  They can't hold a lead either.  I mean, for the season, they've been getting some runs on the board.  And then all of a sudden, their pitching falls apart.  And they lose.  Hard to have a 7-0.  When you score five runs and you're still losing, your pitching stinks on ice. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Love it.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Positively demonic.  Yeah, is it?  Can you try to name and pitch?  Can he?  The milkman.  Belly to belly.  Delivers.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Here's something.  The game's about the players, not you, idiot.  Absolutely.  Shut your mouth.  The milkman delivers.  How old of a thing is that anyway?  When was the last time a milkman?  For the rest of America, I think they know by now. 
[00:26:00]  But it's John Sterling, the play-by-play guy.  Yeah, it was awful.  And he's decided that it should be all about him and not the players on the field.  The traveling elixir salesman delivers.  It's Melky Cabrera.  Yes.  And John Sterling has these horrendous expressions.  And I guess someone in the Yankee front office says, that's good, John.  Keep doing that.  Oh, John, you're doing a bang-up job.  They're horrendous.  And it's a scary time for Mets fans because, you know, I think it was this time last year 
[00:26:30]  that they completely fell apart like no other team has ever fallen apart before.  How big of a lead did they blow?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you tend to forget those things, but a pretty big one.  They were doing pretty well.  Mets are ahead of the Phillies by three, but they're playing the Phillies.  So, you know, we're going to be.  That could change pretty quick.  Yeah, absolutely.  Like double jeopardy.  And the NFL decided to recognize Chad Johnson's new name. 
[00:27:00]  We talked about this earlier in the week.  Yeah.  So they're going to recognize that his new name is Ocho Cinco, and it'll be on Chad's  jersey.  Dope.  What an idiot.  Ocho Cinco.  One drop pass in the papers, wherever he is, is Ocho Stinko.  Why would you name yourself so easy to do that?  How about Bill Bumble, so if you drop the ball, they hit your shoehorn and F in there,  you idiot. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  What do we got?  You want to do what's the haps?  I would love to do what's the haps.  We got Overman losing his mind.  We got Fox reporter Megan Kelly just going after the editor of U.S. Weekly, because they  had on their cover, what was the cover, Babies, Lies, and Scandals?  Well, the week before they had the Obama family on there, and it said, just like, the greatest  family ever.  And then the next week you have Sarah Palin, and it says Babies, Lies, and Scandals.  So it's a little obvious where they're going. 
[00:28:00]  But the Fox reporter just owned this woman.  Owned her.  Yeah.  Did we hear that?  Yeah, we could do that as we get Sam in here for what's the haps.  And then we got to check on E-Rock.  Everyone all right from yesterday's show?  Man, there was a controversy yesterday.  We'll get into it in a little bit.  But there were karate kicks to the stomach.  People might be fired.  E-Rock was at a hospital most of the afternoon yesterday.  And he had nothing to do with the karate kick, by the way. 
[00:28:30]  No, no, that was something different.  Something different.  Tied into the whole thing.  And I was just getting panicked texts from Steve.  Oh, my God.  The pendulum is swinging back the other way.  Steve has two modes of operation.  Lethargy or panic.  Lethargy.  He does. 
[00:29:00]  He goes from zero to 100, man.  It's this.  Here's Steve in a nutshell.  Oh, my God.  Help me.  And that's how you executive produce.  Yes, it is.  Well, according to Washington, you weren't producing yesterday.  Oh.  We're getting all the facts together.  And hopefully the next break we'll talk to E-Rock.  There were accusations of spousal abuse yesterday.  It was just, it's, yes.  Oh, wait till you hear this.  You haven't heard that one yet, stunt brain.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[00:29:30]  Jimmy, stick around.  We'll get into it at 7 o'clock.  Yeah, don't go anywhere.  Don't go anywhere.  I want to make sure that always gold Nagel is taken care of.  Yes.  Always gold.  That son of a bitch always delivers.  And then we got a tattletale among us.  It is just a soap opera.  Emails.  Emails.  All kinds of things going on.  Human resources were involved.  It was just amazing.  Yeah.  We'll get into the whole thing during the next break, okay?  A little tease for everybody. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  We're all going to be fired.  I ruined things.  All right, so we got Fox reporter Megan Kelly talking to the editor Bradley Jacobs of Us Weekly  over the Palin cover that says, Babies, Lies, and Scandals.  I saw this magazine on newsstands.  Let's see what happened here.  Well, Us Weekly, the magazine, is under some serious fire today for its new cover. 
[00:30:30]  The headline grabber, Babies, Lies, and Scandal, is what's causing all the stir.  This story, not only focusing on Sarah Palin, but also on the governor's 17-year-old pregnant daughter.  It got a lot of attention, so did it cross a line?  Here with us now, Bradley Jacobs, the senior editor for Us Weekly.  Hi, Bradley.  Afternoon.  All right, so the problem that a lot of folks have about this, and I have to tell you we've gotten tons of email over this,  is that the headline in and of itself, we'll start with this, sounds like an attack. 
[00:31:00]  Babies, Lies, and Scandal?  What are the lies?  Actually, it's, if you, if you read the story.  Oh, no.  See, right there, right there, even the layman can see.  Oh.  He's having a bit of a problem.  He just realized.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to Ed Naughton.  He just realized, you know, maybe it's not worth going on TV to get a little fame.  Yeah.  Oh, can I just leave? 
[00:31:30]  Oh, boy.  I just realized what I'm in for.  Oh.  Oh.  He immediately knew this was not going to be a fluff interview.  He probably got the call.  Oh, good news.  They watch you on TV.  Yeah, it's going to be great.  Oh, what should I wear?  He's telling his friends, hey, to make sure you watch.  All happy.  Bye.  I haven't even heard this audio.  And you know this is just going to end horribly for this guy.  Because she's so comfortable.  And she's so obviously has a point of view on it. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  She's ready to roll.  She's prepared, ready to roll.  He's just, I'm hot.  If you read the story, you will see it's actually very measured.  It's a very measured story.  What are the lies?  Actually, the lies that we point out are some of the liberal bloggers who were speculating that the daughter was actually, had given birth.  There was a cover up there.  We were one of the few magazines that actually did call to task those liberal bloggers for the news stories. 
[00:32:30]  Don't put the headline.  Bradley, do you think the cover in any way suggests to the viewer who's looking at your magazine while standing there in the grocery store that the lies are lies about Sarah Palin by her attackers?  I don't think we can talk about all that here.  Why not?  Why?  That was the easiest question ever.  When you look at the cover and see babies, lies, and scandal, you're not thinking, well, the lies are the liberal bloggers.  I could tell that without opening the paper. 
[00:33:00]  I have x-ray vision.  I'm going to look through the cover.  You're just looking, babies, lies, and scandal.  You assume the lies and scandal are also part of what's going on with her.  And then when she brings that up to the guy, he goes, this isn't the place to discuss it.  You're here discussing the story.  Yeah.  Where do you want to talk?  Are you meeting people individually in the back of a Buick behind the RNC?  I don't know.  Where should we discuss it?  Me, you, Betsy? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  We'll discuss it.  We'll cut lines of coke on the cover of the magazine.  Me, you, Betsy, a hooker.  Some white man in an Obama mask.  I don't know why he likes that.  He's a size clean but a racist.  I want to acknowledge Pierce Mark from Whackbag.  He's becoming a regular.  He writes, if you saw the video, the guy was all smiley and happy before that point.  And now he's going to fall apart in front of everyone's eyes.  Flop sweat. 
[00:34:00]  We've gotten a lot of press today, but a lot of people haven't read this story.  You may disagree, but it is a fairly, it's a very balanced story.  We interview strategists on both sides.  We interview.  Bradley.  Sarah Peele's deputy.  Yes.  Okay.  You say, first of all, you point out her husband Todd's DUI arrest.  Do you point out that that DUI arrest came 22 years ago in 1986?  Of course. 
[00:34:30]  The DUI arrest was everywhere.  No, you don't.  You don't, Bradley.  That's not in there.  Do you, you mentioned an official, you mentioned so-called Troopergate talking about, and I'm  quoting from your article, an official who refused, she's under investigation for dismissing  an official who refused to fire her sister's state trooper ex-husband.  Do you point out the allegations that that trooper, she allegedly wanted fired, tasered  his own stepson, who was only 10, and made death threats against Sarah Palin's father?  Do you mention that in the article? 
[00:35:00]  We didn't have time to get into everything that you've mentioned.  How busy were you?  Wow.  You know what this reminds me of?  Probably the only funny bit I've ever seen Martin Short do, where he played that nervous  guy being interviewed on, like, 60 Minutes with the cigarette ass that's hanging up and  he's sweating.  What do you mean?  That is exactly what this guy turned into.  The whoopee cushions.  The guy was the whoopee cushions.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What?  The guy named Nathan Thurm.  I don't know what you're talking about. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  There wasn't enough room?  What is he talking about?  Yeah, there's the guy.  Yeah, maybe we can put the link up on onaradio.com.  Nathan Thurm on YouTube.  Uh, wow.  Oh.  And does this remind you of some of our earlier TV interviews?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Wow.  It was supposed to be nice.  I thought they wanted to talk about the show.  And, oh, they always bring these things up.  You know, you go through a couple of these things.  You learn really fast to get your S together if you're going to be on TV. 
[00:36:00]  It's just, uh, this guy is being owned.  Here's the last one.  Can I say you know that you're in trouble?  Yeah.  He was just so happy to, like, hear his own name.  And Nate, what was his name?  Uh, soon to be forgotten, uh, Bradley Jacobs.  Bradley.  Bradley.  Yes.  Yes.  He just came like his mother was calling.  And we're here with Bradley Jacobs.  And he probably gave a nod to the camera.  You know what the intro people are?  Yes, I'm here and ready and prepared. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, my God.  My family's watching.  I look like an idiot.  It's not the place to talk about that.  We didn't have enough time to just...  What are you doing, Bradley?  He has an excuse for everything.  The ink ran out.  We ran out of ink.  We handwrite this.  They're calling him the...  He's the senior editor?  Senior editor?  He's so fired.  I think you're not going to be here for Bradley Jacobs.  You know what, though?  He's just going to go away in a couple weeks.  There'll be a little thing in a paper somewhere.  Here it is.  He wasn't alone there. 
[00:37:00]  Obviously, somebody came to the studio with him, driving him there or whatever.  And they were probably like, no, you did good.  Yeah.  Do you think?  Because she had some questions.  No, you handled it.  You shut her right down.  And then you're on their head.  They're like, oh, my God.  You look like crap.  You couldn't get a coherent word out.  No, you know, the five seconds that you actually talked, you did very well.  Well, she was just schooling him. 
[00:37:30]  See, that's...  I just made fun of myself.  Oh!  From my Letterman appearance.  Did you...  Oh, Jesus.  Because you just described what I went through.  Oh, no.  You know, the five to seven seconds that you actually got to talk.  You know...  You were good.  I've since...  You were good.  I've since watched that again.  And you talk a lot.  Yeah?  No.  All right.  The, uh...  The difference is you weren't being ripped apart by a broad.  Yeah.  By a broad.  By a broad.  Here's...  The slamming continues. 
[00:38:00]  The last minute of this.  You mentioned...  You mentioned her, quote, involvement with the Alaska Independence Party, a group that  wants Alaska to succeed from the Union.  Do you mention the fact that the McCain campaign has denied that, and even Alaska state officials  have denied that and said that's a lie?  Okay.  We're missing the point.  This is a big...  We're missing the point here.  We're missing the point here.  I'm a lying sack of crap.  Yeah.  And I've written it down in this magazine.  We're missing the point. 
[00:38:30]  The point.  This is the point.  This guy is an itty.  The boob.  The point is a spear, and I should fall on it.  You're missing the point.  You're missing the point.  Stop this.  You're making me look silly.  That's the point.  That's the point.  I came here not to look silly, and now I do.  I love this guy.  Oh.  Even Alaska state officials have denied that and said that's a lie.  Okay.  We're missing the point.  This is a big news story that everyone was talking about. 
[00:39:00]  It is a very measured story.  You're just pointing out the few things in it that you are dissatisfied with.  Then you are dissatisfied with the fact that it's fabricated.  We're just so obviously misleading from the cover.  Right.  He doesn't know the detail.  We do mention that.  No, you don't.  Swallow.  Stretching the truth.  If he just had nervous vomit right there, where he just throws up from being nervous. 
[00:39:30]  I had a nervous stomach.  I guarantee you, as he was walking away from camera, he was Pez dispensary tums down his  stupid throat.  His reflux is killing him.  Oh, wow.  Flop sweat under that jacket.  They aren't lies, necessarily.  They're lies of omission.  They're truths that are only half-stated, so you probably couldn't sue them.  Yeah, yeah.  They know how to get away with all that crap, that's for sure.  The agenda's obvious.  That's what the tabloids do.  I'm glad they're getting theirs.  Trust me, I'm glad they're getting theirs. 
[00:40:00]  Wow.  Scott and Hoppog, he writes, this guy wouldn't hack it on the O&A show.  Learn to pass the buck, Bradley.  I was pointing out a few things in it that you are dissatisfied with, but this was a...  Bradley, what I'm satisfied with is fair and balanced reporting, where you tell the  whole story.  You make one accusation, then you tell what the other side is saying.  It's very balanced, rather than throwing things out that are incendiary.  You're not mentioning the fact that we talked to friends of the Palin family.  We talked to students who go to school with Bristol. 
[00:40:30]  We talked to Sarah Palin's deputy mayor.  We talked to Republican strategists and Democratic strategists.  So, because one part of the report is fair in your view, the other unfair reports are  accused.  I've got to leave it at that, because we're out of time.  I wish we could have given this more full discussion.  And I hope your readers will actually read the story for themselves and make up their  own mind.  Your readers.  I will leave it at that.  Good final word.  Bradley, thanks so much.  Thanks so much.  She fell apart at the end, too, throwing out the stupid Fox line about fair and balanced.  Yeah, yeah.  And then when he said, well, we do kind of talk to all that, but she goes, well, the  one part of your story that is fair, well, that doesn't really make sense. 
[00:41:00]  No, she had him anyway.  She had a head full of steam.  Yeah, we're being lied to as we watch these shows.  Fair and balanced.  Fox isn't fair and balanced.  They're very biased, but it's like Bill O'Reilly.  That was proof that was what was played yesterday.  What?  The Bill O'Reilly.  Yeah, because he calls it the no spin zone, and that guy spins, you know.  He was a complete hypocrite on the single mom, teen mom aspect of. 
[00:41:30]  Sure, I got it right here.  I got it.  That little slut.  Yeah, we can squeeze this in.  Bill O'Reilly spins so much, they should name one of these hurricanes that are coming  up the coast.  The Bill O'Reilly.  The Bill O'Reilly is spinning out of control off the coast of North Carolina.  Yeah, he is the worst, man.  So, this is great, and you got to hand it to Jon Stewart in that daily show.  We played this yesterday, but it's worth playing one more time, man.  I love when hypocrites are exposed. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, and they just get caught.  I love it.  What you're about to hear is Karl Rove talking about Palin's experience, and then Jon Stewart  does a little something-something.  Listen to this.  She's a populist.  She's an economic and a social conservative.  She's a reformer.  She's a former mayor.  She's the mayor, I think, of the second largest city in Alaska before she ran for governor.  Karl Rove is very impressed with Governor Palin's experience as mayor of a city with 9,000 people 
[00:42:30]  in it.  I imagine he was equally impressed last month when Tim Kaine, former mayor of Richmond,  population 200,000, former lieutenant governor of Virginia, and now current Virginia governor,  was on Barack Obama's vice presidential short list.  He's been a governor for three years.  He was mayor of the 105th largest city in America.  And again, with all due respect, Richmond, Virginia, and smaller than Chula Vista, California,  Aurora, Colorado, Mesa, or Gilbert, Arizona, North Las Vegas, or Henderson, Nevada, it's 
[00:43:00]  not a big town.  So if he were to pick Governor Kaine, it would be an intensely political choice where he said,  you know what, I'm really not first and foremost concerned with, is this person capable of being  president of the United States?  Same guy.  Same effing guy.  Blatant contradiction.  And a douche.  Karl Rove is a douche.  Yeah.  And then he got O'Reilly doing pretty much the same thing.  Jon Stewart, The Daily Show.  Well, at least everyone can agree on the more sensitive issue of Governor Palin's pregnant 
[00:43:30]  teen daughter.  Millions of American families are dealing with teenage pregnancy, and as long as society  doesn't have to support the mother, father, or baby, it is a personal matter.  It is true that some Americans will judge Governor Palin and her family for the sake of her and  her family.  We hope things calm down.  But, yes, Papa Bear.  Teen pregnancy is an issue for which judgment is personal and must be withheld. 
[00:44:00]  On a pinhead front, 16-year-old Jamie Lynn Spears is pregnant.  The sister of Britney says she is shocked.  I bet.  Here, the blame falls primarily on the parents of the girl.  Who obviously have little control over her.  Incredible.  Incredible.  That's a perfect example of what O'Reilly does on a nightly basis with his dumb show.  And that wasn't a spin?  He didn't put a spin on that?  That is the definition of spin. 
[00:44:30]  You're spinning the friggin' story to make it sound like somebody you like is doing the  same thing, yet they're fine.  You know, you're fine with them doing it.  And then you have a problem with somebody else doing the same thing, so.  Yeah.  Spinning.  What a douche.  There's a difference between, we all have inconsistencies.  I mean, we all, you know, it's human nature that's inconsistent, but there's a difference,  and don't dump out of this, between that and being phony baloney.  Oh.  Baloney.  It's shaped a lot like a big ****, so. 
[00:45:00]  I think you're hitting the car crash, which would have been.  No.  No.  I'll hit this, though.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  You're right.  All right, we gotta take a break.  What about opening?  We're rocking.  Yeah, we'll get to that, too, man.  We got too much to do today.  No.  Maybe we go late today.  That's what we do, Stump Brinkman.  It's Friday.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, no, we go early today.  Get out early.  You're right, Anthony.  One of my things. 
[00:45:30]  Opie and Anthony, we'll see if Iraq's okay.  We got what's the haps with the protesters.  So much.  And then we'll spin out of this political thing and get into other silliness, right?  A.G.N.  What?  He's A.G.N.  Always called Nagel.  Boo!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Happy birthday to primetime.  Sam Robert.  The prime time Sam Robert's birthday is actually tomorrow, but we made an executive decision 
[00:46:00]  that we're not coming in on Saturday to do a show just for your birthday.  That's right.  It's a tradition around the joint to bring in breakfast for the birthday boy.  And when it's myself or Anthony, the breakfast is healthy.  Basal teas, usually.  Yeah, nice egg white omelets.  Oh, nice.  Tasty, healthy we like.  Jimmy, tasty, healthy with maybe some apple pie.  Maybe a little piece of cake afterwards. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, whoa.  I like cake.  It's good.  Steve, when it's his birthday, we're all like, I don't know, chugging smoothies that are just  awful tasting.  I'm one day closer to death.  You're nailing it today, Jimmy.  Steve has two gears, right? 
[00:47:00]  Two gears.  Yep.  Glacier and help me God.  So it's Sam's birthday, and so now we get to eat Sam's favorite food for breakfast, which  is what?  Well, if you know Sam over the time he spent here on the show, you know he's a very finicky,  very picky eater.  He doesn't eat a lot of things that grown-ups eat.  He likes kid food, little finger food, chicken nuggets, things like that. 
[00:47:30]  Um, well, what's another thing that you eat that you eat all the time that your mommy makes  for you?  Well, we got fish sticks as a big one.  Fish sticks, right.  That was the other big thing.  He likes fish sticks.  He likes things that usually by eight years old, you start going, Mom, could I have some  food that, like, I see you and the grown-ups eating?  Yeah.  Bagel bites is a weekly occurrence for dinner.  Bagel bites for dinner.  This is just what Sam does, so.  No veggies, right?  No.  Yeah, okay.  Okay, so, uh, why would we have anything different here for him for his birthday? 
[00:48:00]  So, as I turn around and look, I took a picture, by the way, it should be up on owndayradio.com  in moments, but go ahead.  That is the biggest pile of, uh, what appears to be McDonald's chicken biscuits.  Now, you enjoy these, Sam?  Chicken biscuits are the best.  There's nothing better than McDonald's chicken biscuits.  And Steve, like, earlier in the week was like, what do you want for breakfast for your birthday?  I was like, I don't know, whatever.  I don't even eat breakfast, really.  And he was like, well, what do you eat for breakfast? 
[00:48:30]  And I was like, chicken biscuits.  And he was like, well, is that what you want?  And I was like, yeah, get, like, 50 chicken biscuits.  You're telling me, you're 50.  There's a pile.  There's 50 over there, my friend.  Of course.  He got the 50 chicken biscuits, and then the rest of the staff found out that this was all on Steve's credit card.  So instead of just taking the 50 chicken biscuits, they all ordered their individual favorites for McDonald's breakfast, whether it be a sausage McMuffin or what have you. 
[00:49:00]  I'm declaring bankruptcy.  So Steve spent $183 on McDonald's breakfast.  Holy Jesus, $183.  On 50 chicken biscuits, a dozen hash browns, and a bunch of sausage McMuffins.  Chicken biscuits, that's my screen name in the chat room.  Oh, well.  Lucky us, a nice greasy breakfast.  Eat up.  Yum, yum.  Smell it. 
[00:49:30]  Smells like chicken biscuits in here.  Yes, it is filling the studio with fragrance.  I'm going to fill up my gas tank today.  Just going to squeeze half of those things out into a gas can or something.  They're so good.  Two bites of that thing.  That thing is really good.  They're delicious.  But you know what?  I want to live.  I want to live.  Of course, they're delicious.  Is that your third one, Travis?  No.  I hate the youth.  Travis is such a skinny little wafy twink that he could just eat those all day. 
[00:50:00]  No problem.  Chicken biscuit day has been probably a biweekly celebration in the office for about two months now.  Whereas maybe every other Friday, Travis, me, and Danny will decide today's chicken biscuit day.  See, here we go.  Travis, Sam, I could see you guys just scarfing down the chicken biscuits.  Danny, probably not so much.  He should probably lay off the chicken biscuits.  He doesn't fall into your category, really, of being able to just mow down these chicken biscuits without any ill effects to his guts. 
[00:50:30]  He's thicker.  Don't suck in your belly when you walk in here, you lion sack.  These other two, I don't know what's going on, but not a hint of a fat cell.  It goes right to Danny's bubble butt.  Why the male nudity on this show, man?  He just pulls his pants down and walks out.  Bad food shows up on him the way, like, soda cans showed up in Sean Penn's pillowcase. 
[00:51:00]  Wow.  Yeah, nice.  Yeah, these guys, they don't gain weight.  They could eat this crap every morning.  I hate you.  Sam and I look good.  Whatever.  Look like a twink.  Good.  I'll be down.  You're 30, and they say, sorry, there's no more blood reaching your feet or head.  We're getting the Silence of the Lambs mask for E-Rock so he doesn't partake.  Yeah, we've got to put the mask on him, wheel him past it on a hand truck. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, because, you know, E-Rock can't help himself.  We all know that, so.  You will let me know if that stomach stops rumbling.  Poor E-Rock.  We have to tie him down so he stays away from that pile of goodness over there.  I'm having a few hundred chickens for breakfast.  Speaking of the E to the Rock, E-Rock took one for the team yesterday.  Yeah.  And, wow, we need an update.  How do we explain this to this side of the audience? 
[00:52:00]  There's no real explanation to this thing.  I don't even know how it got started.  I just know that Eastside Dave from Ron and Feather's show was involved in it.  Yeah.  He is not shy, to say the least.  Well, we started talking about tattoos.  That's how it started, right?  We found out that half the guys around here have koi tattoos.  Yeah.  Four or five of the guys have koi tattoos.  Some are pretty cool koi tattoos, and others are horrible koi tattoos.  And then it led to Eastside Dave coming in and showing off his horrible tattoos. 
[00:52:30]  Horrible, I lost a bet tattoos.  He's got a lot of, I lost a bet tattoos.  A lot.  Not just one.  Many of them.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, Danny.  And then Eastside Dave decided if he's going to show off his tattoos, he's got to be naked  because, you know, he's got tattoos all over his body.  And then he warned us that...  And his butt is also branded.  Right.  Like, each cheek...  Right.  ...has a brand in it.  Right.  And then he warned us that we need to hurry up with the segment because he was having 
[00:53:00]  blankies.  He was having...  I like to call them blankies.  Well, stomach issues, let's say.  But he calls them...  You're never going to be able to describe that.  Oh, I know.  I know.  But he warned us.  Yeah, he warned us that he did have to visit the restroom.  Because I know Human Resources is listening to us very closely today to see who should be  fired and who shouldn't.  And the fact is, Eastside Dave warned us that he had this...  This...  Pressing problem.  This pressing problem. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  He needed to use the facilities.  Yes.  And, of course, it's our job to make sure that he doesn't get to a facility anytime soon.  No, no.  Of course not.  Why would we want him to get to a facility?  Because that would be boring radio.  When he can do it right there in the studio and gross everybody out.  Yeah.  So, Bob Kelly starts puking.  Mm-hmm.  And then E-Rock started, I believe, puking, right?  At first?  He was...  What Dave was doing also was cleaning up with a newspaper. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  So the newspaper was then contaminated.  Well, it's fair to say he's not a fan of the comics.  No, no.  He used a Beetle Bailey, I believe.  Yeah.  Not a big fan of Beetle Bailey.  Which made Jimmy very happy.  Yeah, of course.  Jimmy's not a fan of the Beetle Bailey.  No, who is?  No, but Dave improved it greatly.  Yes.  Of course he did.  Yeah.  And then...  He finally added a funny frame at the end.  Yes.  And then he said, Dave, in all his wisdom, and this is what I love about the guy, decided  that he needed to run around with no clothes on, with... 
[00:54:30]  With that newspaper.  With that newspaper.  With that contaminated newspaper in his hand.  Yeah.  And chase E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Right.  That led to E-Rock in a complete panic, what, slamming...  What happened to you?  I still don't know.  I ran out of the studio, and somebody was blocking my way to run out of the studio.  Mm-hmm.  Ran around, hit the security door, because all the doors from coming into XM to the studio  are like in a chamber pattern.  Yeah, it's like an airlock.  It's a get smart type.  Get smart. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  He's walking through it.  Get food.  Get dumb.  Sorry.  So, I hit the security door, and as I was falling, Franklin from the Ron and Fez show  was coming in through the front door of XM.  I hit that door and him, too, and went down onto the floor.  And my hand got caught in the door as Franklin was walking in.  So, the whole top of my hand got cut open and was bleeding, and my elbow went into the 
[00:55:30]  metal frame from the security door.  So, I hit one door, the second door, and fell back, hit the frame of the second door.  How do you run, like the Tasmanian devil?  Well, if you got what's coming at you.  Yeah, yeah, because he knew.  You're going to go into full panic.  Nipping right at his heels was a really disgusting, contaminated newspaper with a nude Dave chasing  him.  Right.  Before the update, Iraq, just keep it right there.  It was obvious that he might have had a broken hand and possibly a broken elbow, right? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  So, then it continues.  Then, Dave, somehow in this melee, Master Poe decided that he needed to karate kick Eastside  Dave pretty hard in the gut.  Master Poe was assuming that Dave was going to run out.  Naked.  Naked.  Naked, holding what can only be described as the most disgusting thing that a human can  produce on a piece of newspaper, and he thought he was going to run out into the hallway. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  Out of his realm of security.  Right.  And into the building's, you know, private area, thus getting in trouble.  Right.  He assumed.  Right.  So, instead of saying, hey, stop, or whatever, he decides to kick Dave in the stomach or  the chest.  I don't know where the big footprint ended up, but it was on Dave.  Right above his abdomen.  Yeah.  So, it was kind of like right below his boobies. 
[00:57:00]  He kicked him and just laid him out.  Laid him out with a kick.  Right on the floor.  Master Poe has some belts.  He's got some of those black belts.  Well, yeah.  He's a martial artist.  One of our guys is like, what is that about?  Yeah, and then Poe said, well, you know, if he goes out into the hallway, we get in  trouble.  Uh-huh.  No, Dave gets in trouble.  But this is where Poe is just not a smart man.  Dave was never going to go into the hallway.  Dave knows the limits of what's happening over there when we're doing our radio show. 
[00:57:30]  And Poe, we've told him over and over and over again, he doesn't understand what we  do with this radio show.  He doesn't understand.  And now it has led to him laying the east side Dave out with a kick.  And then this guy, then he finds out this video.  So, then he complains to what?  Human resources?  He calls Washington?  He's like a little tattletale and gets everybody in trouble.  Then the phones are ringing all day yesterday.  Oh, that's when I started getting texts, panicky texts from Steve. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  He was very panicky.  Yeah, apparently Poe assumed that he had to make a preemptive strike.  And even though no one knew about this, we didn't say anything, no one was going to  go and say Poe kicked Dave or anything, Poe decided to make a preemptive strike and write  an email to one of the supervisors.  Which is...  Which you never...  I don't even have to tell the people listening to us. 
[00:58:30]  That is so not cool.  You don't draw attention to anything, to the brass.  You wait for brass to come to you with a problem.  You never go to them.  Never.  Because it's only trouble.  All hell breaks loose on this radio show on a regular basis.  And none of us are calling Washington and telling on anyone, except for Poe.  Poe's the only one.  And he's the toughest guy in the room, but he's not that tough.  Because he goes running to these lawyers and human resource people.  He's the only one that does that.  So he went to one of the supervisors, who then I guess, now that the supervisor is on 
[00:59:00]  to what's going on, it makes kind of a problem.  We like to...  I'll be honest with you.  We have rules that we have to follow.  But sometimes we get a little rambunctious, and perhaps we'll stretch those or bend them.  I'm being honest.  But we know it's safe, it's cool.  All for the sake of good radio, by the way.  Good radio.  And we definitely try to keep everyone safe.  Safe, happy, whatever.  We all know Dave is a friggin' lunatic. 
[00:59:30]  So that's the type of radio he does.  But then if you get in touch with the supervisor, now the supervisor feels he's got to do something.  Right.  So they get in touch with this one and this one.  And before you know it, the story has gone down a line, a chain of command, and turned  into some huge issue that now Steve was getting emails and texts and stuff.  And he's texting me that, you know, it's over.  It's over.  Yes.  I have no respect for anyone that sends emails to human resources.  None.  None whatsoever. 
[01:00:00]  You've got to take care of your own battles.  You've got to.  That is such a, I can't even express how lame of a move that is.  How lame that is.  We're all working together.  We're a group of guys doing a radio show.  And we have one guy that is running to Washington whenever he can.  And sending out emails and getting human resources involved.  I can't express how lame that is.  And everyone out there listening to us, they have one of those guys in their office. 
[01:00:30]  Especially when.  One of those guys that just want to, like, get people in trouble.  It's like no one was trying to get anyone in trouble.  No.  The heat of the moment happened.  No one was hurt.  It was, you know, everything's being played up for the air.  It's all good.  And then once you go to the bosses, because nothing happened.  No, it was, nothing happened.  No one was saying anything.  I'll tell you what happened, because they're saying what Dave was running around with is a health issue and blah, blah, blah.  But Dave knows that in the end. 
[01:01:00]  And I told some people, because now they're calling me.  I'm like, no, what's more dangerous is a karate kick to the gut.  That could kill somebody.  And also poke through a garbage can and a bucket full of ice at Dave as well.  Like, way to understand what's going on around you.  I think the thing is, he was worried for whatever reason, but it's almost like, well, when the radio show's going on, people inside the studio understand that we're not going to run into the hallway.  We understand the parameters and the limits.  Right, right, right.  So your job is to not protect us from a bit that Dave is doing, or to protect Dave from running into the hallway. 
[01:01:30]  You're not babysitting.  If Dave, Dave is not stupid.  He plays stupid, but he's not stupid.  He wasn't going to run into the hallway.  He was not going to do that.  He was not really going to rub anything on anybody.  And no one really thought he was.  Well, not, I mean, one person thought.  Well, exactly.  That's the problem.  Nobody who should be in the radio studio thought that.  Right.  Dave falls down a lot.  Let's break the wall here. 
[01:02:00]  Dave will run around with something gross.  He'll run two feet with his pants around his ankles and fall.  Just fall into something head first.  That's part of the gig he's doing.  It's part of the show.  He doesn't want to, let's break it.  He's not going to really rub anything on E-Rock or anybody else.  And we all understand that.  I sit two inches from him when he does that.  I keep saying not all, unfortunately.  And that's the big issue today.  I'd run my ass off, too, though.  Of course I would.  I wouldn't just stand there because you never know.  And it's just getting too close to you. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But that's Dave.  And we're all laughing like, holy crap, all hell's breaking loose.  And one guy's not laughing and decides he needs to karate kick somebody.  That is so effing lame.  And then when E-Rock stops, Dave falls.  Why does he fall?  Because he's not really intending on rubbing anything on anybody.  It's so great.  And I hate to break the bit up for anybody, but that's what was going on.  He's not retarded.  It's so irritating that somebody wouldn't get that.  And leads to emails and calls.  You know, I hope he's not even over there today. 
[01:03:00]  I can't even look at the guy.  I can't even look at the guy.  He's not one of us.  He's just not one of us.  He doesn't get it.  And then E-Rock went to the hospital.  And E-Rock, man, I was talking to E-Rock yesterday.  You had me laughing pretty effing hard.  So what's the update on the elbow, the hand?  All right, well, the elbow is a little stiff, but it's fine.  The hand's not broken.  It'll be fine, too.  I see.  Ace bandage, though.  Yeah, they said to keep it until Sunday, but I... 
[01:03:30]  Need an eye patch?  Linger-lunger.  So I get to the emergency room, and there's a guy next to me who has his face all cut open from sheet metal.  Yeah.  And they sign us in on this list, and they determine that both of us are not a top priority right now.  So we're both sitting next to each other.  The guy's bleeding from his face, and he's not a top priority.  25 minutes later, they get me in, and the guy bleeding is still sitting next to me.  I'm like, maybe you should take him first. 
[01:04:00]  Great triage they got over there.  And they go, no, no, you're next.  Sucking chest wound or a hangnail.  Yeah.  My insurance.  Ah, probably.  So they bring me in, and they put me in a room where this lady comes in with a laptop.  She's filling out my insurance and personal information, and my girl's with me.  Then the nurse comes in and asks, she said, I have to speak to Eric.  I need everybody to leave.  And then she turns to Angela, and she goes, I need you to leave, too.  Uh-oh.  So she goes, okay.  So they all leave.  She shuts the door. 
[01:04:30]  And said, you're fat.  That has nothing to do with this.  Look, son, don't have any chicken besoins tomorrow morning.  So she sits down next to me, and she looks at me, and she goes, is this a domestic abuse  issue?  Ooh.  And I go, are you kidding me?  And she goes, I have to ask you.  I said, have you-  Ask me again.  I'll punch you.  You should have told me.  Well, you should have said, pointed towards the door where Angela was and go, ask that  bitch! 
[01:05:00]  So I said, are you serious?  Have you looked at her?  And she goes, I have to ask you, is this a domestic abuse issue?  Is everything okay at home?  I said, everything's fine.  It's work that sucks.  Exactly.  They all make fun of me.  My refrigerator door gets beat up from all the opening and closing.  The cookie drawer's in bad shape.  But the treadmill, you can eat off it.  Sorry.  Thanks.  So she goes, okay, I just had to check.  And then the nurse leaves and looks at Angela, and she goes, you can come back in, like directly 
[01:05:30]  stating it to Angela.  So that's like, I guess, is that common practice now?  And did she assume that you hurt your hand belting her, or that she, like, did something  to you?  Because when I signed in and they were taking my insurance information, I said, I got hurt  at work.  I kept saying I got hurt at work.  So I don't know if that triggered something.  It was at work.  That's what all the husbands do say, to hide the fact that their wife could, you know,  slug them.  And the wife always says, you know, she hit herself with the door. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, you know.  It's like, oh, when my husband threw me into it.  But I've never heard of a guy being asked that question.  No.  And the husband always says, well, I was being chased with a disgusting newspaper, and I  hit my hand on a door that Franklin was walking through.  Franklin.  Franklin.  Franklin was coming through the door.  And a man with questionable-sized genitals was kicking somebody.  Good observation.  Franklin is a weird name.  Franklin.  Hello, Franklin. 
[01:06:30]  What happened?  Well, Franklin was coming through the door.  Was he?  Franklin should be a Bond traitor, not in radio.  I'm Franklin.  Hello, Franklin.  Franklin's a good guy.  So wrap it up, P-Rod.  All right, so the doctor comes in, and now I have to explain how I got hurt, and it's  on the medical report that I was being chased by Dave with a disgusting newspaper.  Oh, really?  It's on that?  That's great.  So, um, then the newspaper had to explain it hurt itself because it was chasing you. 
[01:07:00]  Boo.  Boo!  Boo!  So then they send me to radiology, and I'm getting my hand x-rayed.  What was on the newspaper?  That joke?  Sorry, Iraq, just had to redeem myself before the break.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  So I'm in radiology, and you have to turn your cell phone off while you're in there.  So I thought my phone was off.  I'm getting x-rayed.  Coming up, Robert Kelly will be joining the Opie and Anthony show.  He's going to be at Caroline's tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday, 212-757-4100. 
[01:07:30]  What's the haps on the way?  Oh, brutal.  We've got a primetime gossip from Sam Roberts.  You want to go with this?  I want to hear.  Yeah, let's go with this as we go to break here on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back with another pulse-pounding rendition of primetime gossip.  Recently on the Opie and Anthony show, overweight comedian Bob Kelly came in to say hi to the host of the show and create an uncomfortable situation for everyone. 
[01:08:00]  I went from one to another to another.  And, um, and no, I won't have it anymore.  You and your girl are still together.  What?  You done?  Hello?  Awkward.  Huh?  Awkward.  What?  Sorry, dude.  While we have no idea what he was referring to, that wasn't the O&A news of the day.  The real buzz kicked in when Anthony let the audience in on his latest media endeavor. 
[01:08:30]  Reality programming is phony.  I just want the real deal.  See, this has to be me and six to eight girls.  And that's it?  Yes!  That's right.  A 24-hour webcam show centered around Anthony and his kinky sex antics.  This will be the real deal.  Reality programming where it's just me with a bunch of chicks living at my house.  However, Anthony's focus may not be on women alone.  Everything is done in bra and panties, by the way. 
[01:09:00]  Yes, even me.  I'll be in bra and panties the whole time.  Will Anthony's bisexual drag queen sex party romp be a hit?  Stay tuned as you get all the information from Primetime Gossip.  Opie and Anthony.  Got Bob Kelly in studio.  And we got Norton.  Jimmy, you got the Wilbur Theater coming up, right?  Yeah, I got two things that went on sale.  Boston, November 19th. 
[01:09:30]  November 15th.  Tickets are on sale at Ticketmaster.  It's over half sold from the pre-sale yesterday, so that was great.  And Stress Factory, the 7th through 9th of November, the week before.  Go to StressFactory.com.  That went on sale at midnight.  So, you know, just check me out in November on my MySpace page.  You can catch me at Stress Factory.  See, we told you Jimmy likes Vinny's Club down there in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  I don't like Vinny's Club.  Jim, why don't you like my club?  Just come down.  I'm going to give you the most money I can.  And I'm going to do my phone calls. 
[01:10:00]  Where are you from, sir?  Yeah, your daughter's been picked up by the police.  That's so inside.  He doesn't do those on my shows.  He doesn't do the phone call with you?  No.  Oh, God, I suck.  Why?  You still have to deal with the phone call.  You're not big enough yet.  Yeah, I know.  That's when you know you're big.  I mean, right?  You get big enough, you don't have to deal with hacky bits before you at the Stress Factory.  You know what?  Maybe he does do them.  Maybe if someone would see me there, maybe he has done them, and I'm saying no. 
[01:10:30]  I don't think he has, though.  I think he has.  Back in the day, maybe he hasn't in the last few times you've been there.  But, you know, he calls up some mom or dad and makes the funny joke that their kid was in some kind of horrific situation.  It's the most uncomfortable thing I've ever seen.  What?  What happened?  Well, yeah, she hit a tree.  God.  Yeah, she was beheaded.  She was over in Iraq as a contractor.  He does a prank call in front of the audience. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, but it's the worst prank.  What?  Is she okay?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we're going to need you to come down here and identify her mouth.  That's all we have left.  Oh, God.  Right.  Here's how you stop that.  At my shows in November, if Vinny does a call, please just all scream, Vinny's a queer.  Oh.  Oh, no.  And even if he doesn't.  Oh, no.  Bobby, way to go, by the way.  Because of you, Anthony's in the paper today. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Thanks, blabbermouth.  You are a blabbermouth.  Way to go, Bobby.  Way to go.  In the daily news.  Daily news.  What is that?  Russian Malloy?  It was all planned out.  Me and Anthony worked with his publicist.  Did we?  How to get him in the news.  I have a publicist?  What?  Did I get him in the news?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I apologize.  I didn't.  I didn't. 
[01:12:00]  I thought you got, you know, things.  Well, maybe you should ask some questions before you go on the air.  That's right, Bob.  I'd like to talk to Bob like Pacino spoke to Kevin Spacey and Glenn Gary Glenn Ross.  I'd like to talk to him like spoke to Spacey and Glenn Gary Glenn Ross.  No, that wasn't.  No, because it was.  It's a little.  No.  Was that on Golden Bond?  Well, when he, uh, when Spacey says the wrong thing, oh, no, your contracts went out last  night.  Pacino's like, no, not to my knowledge. 
[01:12:30]  I thought he just, she kills Spacey, you effing see.  That wasn't Miller-like reference.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  I'm sorry it wasn't from, you know, a movie that's 40 years old like I like quoting.  You're like Shelly when you're at the Carp DM.  Oh, God.  Uh, Anthony, do I have permission to read this?  Uh, yeah, sure.  Why not?  It's in the newspaper.  Uh, Daily News in the, uh, gossip column.  Ooh.  Gossip. 
[01:13:00]  The gossip column.  It says, uh, Opie and Anthony fans' suspicions were confirmed yesterday when Blabbermouth comic  Robert Kelly asked Anthony Cumia if he and CW11 Traffic Babe Playboy model Jill Nicolini  were still on.  Way to go, Bobby.  Way to go.  Thanks, Bob.  Uh, and Cumia mumbled no.  So, and then they, uh, they say here, wonder if it has anything to do with that recent YouTube 
[01:13:30]  video of a very young pretty blonde on Anthony's lap.  Now that boy was just a nephew.  It doesn't, couldn't they have said girl?  Uncle Paul's laughing at that one.  Uh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wee, wow.  A little scandal.  So scandalous. 
[01:14:00]  Uncle Paul.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  Very funny.  She was a towel tale.  Nice, my brother's son.  Oh, God damn.  Yeah.  So that's how it, uh, comes out because we've been, uh, kind of, uh, kind of just skirting  the issue there, Bobby.  Way to go.  That, uh, that, uh, video was, um, came out like after the fact.  It wasn't, there was no breakup that was caused by some YouTube video. 
[01:14:30]  That was, uh, yeah, after the fact.  That's all I'm saying.  It's just, uh, you know, I'm getting some facts out there.  It was amicable.  And, uh, yes, it was a girl.  It wasn't a boy.  Yeah.  Um.  Thank God.  Those YouTube videos.  And, uh, uh, a, a, a boy, uh, named Danny was on Anthony's lap.  Yeah.  So that's, uh, that's that.  It's in the gossip column. 
[01:15:00]  Anthony was teaching him how to shotgun a beer.  Are you sad?  What?  Are you sad?  Are you all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  You know, like late at night, though, like when you lighten that fireplace and all by  yourself in that big room, like, it's because I'm all by myself.  Exactly.  Does it, does it, does it suck?  I have house guests.  You do?  Like all night?  Sometimes.  Really?  Yeah.  And I'm sitting there just in front of the fire going, Rosebud.  No.  No. 
[01:15:30]  No, just, you know, one of those, one of those things.  Let's do that.  What can you say?  I'm sorry, dude.  I liked her.  Yeah, I'm, you know, I didn't say anything bad.  She was cool.  Yeah.  Do you guys still talk?  Occasionally.  Like, she call you or you call her all the time?  Text.  You text her, like, all the time and you wait for her to text?  No, there's, there's, um.  He texts, how are you?  And she texts, die. 
[01:16:00]  Thank you, Jimmy.  They give the same boring line of questions.  I was waiting for somebody to jump in.  Would I have a friends and family plan?  No, there's, uh, yeah.  I don't know.  There's, there's, uh, there's just a great story that one of these days will make really  a great story.  Oh, there's a tease.  That's a tease.  It's just fantastic.  So that story's true.  What?  Oh, which one did you hear?  Anthony. 
[01:16:30]  Wow.  Anthony got real on, what?  Wow.  Well, he started it.  There's a, uh, yeah, there's a great story in there.  There's a story going around.  I'll, I'll say that much.  He didn't, he didn't know an old Jew from Long Island.  What?  What?  Huh?  I just followed his lead.  He said, and I said.  I just said, there's a great story that, like, would be, it would be, put it this way.  It'd be very entertaining.  What?  And it's, it'll probably make a great entry in a book one day.  It'll be, it'll be very, uh, uh, compelling. 
[01:17:00]  Would it be a chapter?  Uh, yeah, I can make a chapter out of that.  Wow.  Could you give us a hint to this story at this point in time?  Uh, no, no, I don't think a hint is a good idea.  When can you, uh, maybe tell this story?  Uh, should I tell Bobby the story and then have Bobby slip?  No.  No.  No.  Um.  Let's put it this way.  Anthony's excuse was, no, I have those photos.  I was doing research for a book.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:17:30]  When will you maybe let this story out?  Um, let me think.  Because if it's the one I heard, it's, it's pretty amazing.  Is it a Lulu?  Oh, man, you'll get the whole town talking.  It's a good one.  It's a, it's a, yeah.  Yeah, that was a, you piqued my interest.  That's right.  When should you tell the story?  Why don't we put a time on it?  Hmm.  Let me think.  You're in the press.  Need another month?  Because there's just a few things that need resolution.  That's all.  Resolution? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, a couple of things that just need some resolution.  And then I could, you know, I could, I'll, I'll talk.  Like there has to be no chance you'll ever get back with her ever.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It has nothing to do with that.  You'll never get a piece of that again.  No, no.  Then you can talk.  No, no, no.  It has nothing to do with it.  It's just, there are a few items, let's just say, that need to be exchanged before, you  know.  But she has to get your handmaid t-shirt back?  There's the, what? 
[01:18:30]  Nothing, sorry.  Did you leave your AC hanky at her place?  So she, she has stuff of yours and you have stuff of hers still?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  That's pretty much, pretty much it.  So until the, the exchange is made, then, you know.  You're not saying anything.  I don't say anything.  Wow, people are going to start fishing around more now, my friend.  What are they going to fish?  Let them fish.  Let them fish.  Let them fish and speculate.  That's what our audience has done since day one with this show.  Yeah.  With all the drama.  We have so much drama. 
[01:19:00]  So, uh, but yeah, it was a, uh.  Why don't you just get a glad trash bag and stick it on the front and tell her to come  over and grab it and leave your stuff on the front porch.  That's what I told the ex.  Yeah.  So the stuff will be out the door.  Treated her like Kay in The Godfather.  I just shut the door slowly in her face.  It was an abortion answer to me.  I'm talking about the ex, uh, ex-girlfriend.  So the story.  Yeah.  The story will, the story will come out eventually. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, eventually.  So it leads to Ant's, uh, latest endeavor, which is to put, uh, webcams all over his  huge house and invite women to basically live with him.  That's what I want to do.  I want to get a whole web, uh, site set up with, uh, live webcams in various rooms in  the house, you know, cover in the house and then, uh, invite six to eight girls as like  a sleepover thing.  And they have bunk beds in the rooms and hang out and just do what girls do, you know? 
[01:20:00]  And, uh, are you going to invite them to live with you for, uh, a specific amount of time,  like a month at a time?  Or is it just like, uh, maybe rotate new ones in.  I understand that.  I don't know.  But is it a weekend thing?  Is it going to be?  No, I think it would be only be good if it was, you know, around the clock.  So you're going to have women there around the clock.  All the time.  This is exactly what I told you to do a while ago with your house.  Yeah.  The home for, what was it called again?  Wayward, um, uh, skanks or sluts or something. 
[01:20:30]  No.  I think the word coke was in there as well.  Coke whores?  Something.  Yeah.  No, I got to revamp that because I, you know, I don't want my stuff missing.  Right.  You know, things like that.  Maybe have Keith as security cracking the whip.  He's, uh, he's in line.  He's serious.  He's going to do this.  And he can tase them, you know, out of line.  You said you're going to do it by the spring and I'm saying you need to do this immediately.  I know I need to do it immediately, but logistically, it's kind of, I got my tech guy working on other stuff right now.  Like, like, like hooking up my computer systems. 
[01:21:00]  That's got to all be done.  Oh, I thought.  A new desk today.  I thought you meant deleting files.  Big desk.  Deleting files.  Burning hard drives.  Right.  And then sinking them in the bottom of the pool.  Right.  Putting old computers.  All my computers are safe.  Putting old computers in concrete.  I have nothing illegal in, in, on any of my computers.  Yeah.  That's right.  I'm sure that if you do have that, all those girls over, you'd be in bed by 11.  Sure. 
[01:21:30]  And up for the show.  Yeah, I'm sure that'll help the show.  I didn't even think of that.  At this point, I'm just enjoying the ride.  We got a, we got a little promo because you're, you're looking for the girls and here we got this.  Reality programming is phony.  I just want the real deal.  The Kumia Foundation is proud to present a brand new website the whole family can enjoy.  This will be the real deal.  Reality programming on the internet where it's, it's the real deal.  It's just me with a bunch of like chicks living at my house. 
[01:22:00]  It's Uncle Anthony's hot drunk sluts who put out allnight.com.  It's the idea of having a bunch of drunk young women at the house, but girls that really party and stuff.  Would this be a 24 hour a day thing?  Yep.  It's Uncle Anthony's hot drunk sluts who put out allnightandday.com.  Yeah.  With guns and hoos.  Someone's getting shot.  Guns that could go off at any time.  Right.  How, how exciting is that?  One night I could teach them all how to field strip on AR-15. 
[01:22:30]  It's Uncle Anthony's hot drunk sluts who like guns and put out allnightandday.com.  Some of the rooms put bunk beds in there and then the cameras and they can, you know, go at each other.  And then the jacuzzi.  And see, this has to be me and six to eight girls.  And that's it.  Yes.  Log on and get in touch with yourself.  Uh, two words.  Panty party!  Yes.  Panty party indeed. 
[01:23:00]  Although Stephen S. from Bayshore writes, uh, where, where was that there?  Let me, okay.  Anthony's home of daddy issues.  Anthony's home of daddy issues.  Yeah, that's a good one.  This isn't a radio bit, by the way.  Anthony will.  No, no.  This has to get done.  Definitely, I'm going to do this.  Why not?  All right, we're going to change gears because we got a bunch of stuff we could do.  We could, we could sneak in the Keith Olbermann thing.  We could, uh, maybe do the, uh, the people crying over dead trees.  Which one do you want to do fast? 
[01:23:30]  Crying over dead trees?  And then after the break, we got Big A and Roland doing the news for us, which is going to be terrific.  And we got, uh, birthday dummies got what the haps.  Yeah, I know.  That's why I want to try to, let's try to squeeze one more thing in here.  What do you got?  You want to go with the Keith Olbermann?  Yeah, we could do that.  I wouldn't want to hear that.  This blowhard.  Oh, that guy really is a pit bull.  Get out of his way.  Well, the setup is real simple.  The Republican National Convention last night, they decided to show kind of a 9-11, uh, we've 
[01:24:00]  been threatened for years video.  Yeah, it was 30 years of terrorism's greatest hits.  Yeah.  From the Iran thing to the cold to the Beirut bombing finishing with 9-11.  And when you start showing 9-11 footage, you know, you're going to get people getting  a little uptight about it.  Yeah.  Understandably.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  Uh, what was interesting about this video last night, they didn't show Bush down at Ground  Zero.  They showed Rudy Giuliani doing the same thing.  It would be inappropriate.  What?  Oh, the president.  Jesus Christ.  I, you know, I got to think sometimes before I speak. 
[01:24:30]  Uh, and some people thought it was, uh, appropriate, of course, and some people thought, what are  they doing?  Why are they going down this road?  Yeah.  Well, that's always been one of those Republican staples with, uh, with the politicians.  They really have brought that out and, and been like, Hey, if you don't vote for us,  it's going to happen again.  Yeah.  The Republicans keep us safer from terrorism.  And they remind us every second tube. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  So, uh, Oberman was one of these guys that just thought it was just ridiculous that they  did this.  I'm sorry.  It's necessary to say this.  And I wanted to separate myself from the others on the air about this.  If at this late date, any television network had of it.  Can I, can I set this up please by saying that this Keith Oberman, he comes across as  a tough guy on TV, but he doesn't do anything until he checks with the bosses first.  He's one of those guys.  Yeah.  So he probably went into some office and said, I'm going to do this tonight.  Is this okay? 
[01:25:30]  Because if it's not okay, I'm not going to do it.  All right.  Do it.  But because you know, uh, I don't want to, I don't want to lose my job or anything.  Yeah.  He's a worm.  And that's for the people that linger long in the crap he did with Imus where he kept his  mouth shut until it was, he knew his job was safe.  And then he went on TV and spewed all his hate for, uh, Mr. Imus.  A worm.  So you know that he checked with everybody before he did this.  Late date, any television network had of its own accord showed that much videotape and  that much graphic videotape of nine 11.  And I speak as somebody who lost a few friends there. 
[01:26:00]  It, we would be rightly, uh, eviscerated at all quarters, perhaps by the Republican party  itself for exploiting the memories of the dead, and perhaps even for trying to evoke that  pain again.  Uh, if you reacted to that videotape the way I did, I apologize.  Uh, uh, it is a subject of great pain for many of us still, and was probably not appropriate  to be shown.  We'll continue in a moment.  His, his comment was just as self-serving as showing the, the footage. 
[01:26:30]  I don't know.  Just say, I don't even disagree that it's like a writer ready with nine 11.  I mean, you don't have to keep showing it.  If you're using it for political and a political rally, it is kind of irritating, but his melodrama,  you're right.  That's what kills you is he's everything, every time he speaks, it's this monologue of  drama. 
[01:27:00]  Everything is just like, Oh my God, can you believe this, sir?  Well, I can't believe they used this.  Yeah.  It's, I don't know.  I don't know what to think if that's like, um, a bad thing to use.  I mean, it, I don't think it's exploiting the, the dead.  I think it's, it's exploiting the, um, the event, you know, but, but, uh, and maybe not 
[01:27:30]  what the hell to think on this one.  Well, well, Anthony was, it was well thought out though, because what they did, I'm sure  they want to just do nine 11 cause that's what everyone knows and remembers obviously,  but they kind of put it into a montage of like, look, we're not really exploiting nine  11 cause we're showing you some opening band terrorist attacks before the headliner.  We're showing you 30 years of this.  So look, look, we're not exploiting the nine 11.  It's just part of what we're trying to say here.  Cause they, I think if they just had nine 11 for us, the outrage today would be like over 
[01:28:00]  the top, right?  Yeah.  So they kind of softened it by showing, look, we've been threatened for 30 years now.  We, the Republicans are the only ones that could keep you safe.  There was an ad, uh, years ago.  Who the hell put that one out there?  Stunt brain with the atom bomb, little kid picking daisies.  There's a little girl and she's, um, picking daisies and, uh, she looks up and, and there  goes the sky, just big mushroom cloud. 
[01:28:30]  And it was like that got flack even back then.  People were like, Hey, what are you trying to do?  Scare the crap out of us?  I think it was a late sixties, early seventies political ad and I would bet it was the GOP,  but not sure.  We'll see if we can pull it.  It was actually a company that sells daisies.  Oh, the daisy pickers, uh, Ted's Daisies, I believe.  Ted's Daisy Company.  Have your daisies been lost due to an Armageddon?  Have you lost 45,000 friends and family as well as your daisies? 
[01:29:00]  Is your image burnt onto a wall?  Uh, it was, uh, Barry Goldwater.  Was that the, um, LBJ did it?  Good old LB.  Was he running against Goldwater?  I don't know.  Yep.  We got the ad.  We'll throw it up on O and A radio.  Yeah, that's it.  There she goes.  She's like doing a little, like, loves me, loves me not thing.  A little innocent daisy thing.  Cute.  Where's the mushroom cloud in the background? 
[01:29:30]  It hits in the background?  Huh?  Oh, it'll become, and they talk about this, you know, how nice it is to live here and  in America, blah, blah, blah, and then, oh, the kid looks up, little, little, little  face, looks right into, zoom into the eyeball, so you see the reflection, and there it is.  Oh, boy.  A big hydrogen bomb explosion.  Oh, boy.  There goes her innocence.  She needs daisies.  Yes.  This girl lost all of her daisies. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, so that ad was kind of, definitely caught some criticism.  And it's got to be said, they both do it, because it's being pointed out by Bruce and  Louisiana and a few other people.  Democrats showed the Katrina footage to make the report.  Yeah, that's true.  There you go.  You know, that's what they do.  You know, McCain's wife, there's something evil about her.  Hot?  No, just, like, when you watch, the way she, she has the same smile, it looks like she  has, like, 101 Dalmatians somewhere. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, wow, that's pretty creepy.  You know something?  That's pretty good, Bobby.  You're right.  She does.  There's something evil looking about her.  Yeah.  She scares me when I look at her.  Listen, Bobby Kelly of Studio.  We got robertkellylive.com.  We got Bob Kelly at Caroline's starting tonight.  I'm going tonight.  Okay.  I thought you'd be a little more excited.  No, I'm excited.  I was waiting.  I thought there was more, like, what show?  I don't know yet.  Oh, okay.  But you're there all weekend.  212-757-4100.  Big A and Roland doing some news for us. 
[01:31:00]  What's the haps on the way?  And we got earth people crying over dead trees.  Still lots to do on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hmm.  Oh, Jimmy, your mic isn't working.  There we go.  There it is.  Stunt Fingers.  Welcome back to Norton and Friends.  My guests today are Greg Hughes and Anthony Fumia.  Thank you.  And Robert Kelly.  Robert Kelly joining the forum.  And, uh, hi, Bob. 
[01:31:30]  Whose mic isn't on either?  Mike, yeah.  Why would it?  Wow.  Stunt brain.  That's all right.  There I am.  Hi, Jim.  Not very familiar with the mixing board.  See what happens when Opie just tries to squeeze one out before a commercial.  Can't throw a fuse in this place.  No kidding.  Stunt brain couldn't turn a mic on.  You think it's magic, Mike?  How long have you been doing radio?  All right.  We got what's the haps.  We got, uh, earth, uh, first members crying over dead trees. 
[01:32:00]  Earth first?  Yeah.  Yeah, this sounds like a great group.  Earth first before, I guess, everything.  So, kill yourself.  Well, who got the earth first clips?  Danny?  I hate these protesters.  All right.  Stand by, uh, Sam.  I know it's your birthday tomorrow.  Stand by.  And we also got Big A and Roland doing the news.  It's...  Oh, really?  I love when Big A does the news.  And then you got Roland with his tragic news.  So, we're going to mix the two together together today, I'm assuming, right? 
[01:32:30]  You should make Big A hold a puppy in his hand while he does the news.  Just twist its neck.  That thing would be so dead when he was done.  And he wouldn't even realize he'd killed it.  He'd just wringing his hands all nervously and just twisting it like a balloon animal.  Oh, I killed it.  He's sleeping.  Maybe if we applause and applaud, he'll come back to life. 
[01:33:00]  He'll come back.  Everybody clap.  Run for your life.  It's Sam's birthday.  Yeah.  Danny, what do you got?  Well, this clip is just of these, uh, these, like, hippie earth emo people.  They're out in the woods, and they're having a meeting, and they're talking about how terrible  it is when trees die and when humans kill trees.  And, uh, they're just kind of expressing their, uh...  Deforestation, man! 
[01:33:30]  Shut it.  They're basically mourning in the woods.  I went north of New York City last weekend, when we had the long weekend.  Within a half hour, there were so many effing trees.  I'm like, what's the problem with this planet?  There are plenty of trees.  There are plenty of trees.  You know the foresting industry?  The logging industry.  They replace trees when they harvest them.  It's like farming.  It just takes forever.  The older guys, though, man, they didn't.  No, back then, they just chopped and went.  But then someone came along and said, you know, maybe we should... 
[01:34:00]  Well, because I think harvesting of trees got a little more efficient, and they weren't  just a couple of guys with that big long saw cutting down one tree at a time.  But now they, you know, they have whole areas that they replant.  They have people in there with the little trees, and they plant them in there.  Every tree they cut down, they actually plant two trees.  We have too many trees now.  I swear to God, the founder of Greenpeace quit Greenpeace because it became a political 
[01:34:30]  organization instead of what it was meant to be.  And he actually said, like, look, people cutting down trees is fine.  It's actually better because they plant two trees for every one they cut down.  So, I mean, it takes, you know, a hundred years for that.  It takes a long time.  But, you know, I mean, it's not like things aren't being done.  And these guys, unless you're in a loincloth on the plains hunting your own food with weapons  that you make out of stone and wood, you can't complain about anything. 
[01:35:00]  These jackasses, I'm sure, using their cell phones to call mommy and daddy for more money  and using technology that you need to chop trees down for, you need to burn fuel, all kinds  of stuff.  But they, man, no, man, we got to save the planet, man.  Oh, listen to these guys.  Let's get right to the audio.  They sit in the woods and they mourn dead trees.  Deep in the woods of North Carolina, an extreme... 
[01:35:30]  No, stop.  I can't even.  We've all burned.  Is that someone crying over dead trees?  Now I'm realizing I probably made a mistake with this clip because I cut out, like, ten seconds  of just, like, sobbing and crying.  Dude.  Why would you do that?  Because it wouldn't make sense to just start with that.  So, I clipped it to just the guy coming.  It makes perfect sense.  This is so good.  I'll have to get the first part.  It's not that much.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  The dead trees.  Deep in the woods of North Carolina, an extremist eco-group called...  Terry Schiavo is there.  And the tree is telling her, shut up.  The tree's smarter than she is.  Exactly.  Just drop the acorn or dopey hairdo.  Jeez.  Your father has more interaction with it.  Jeez.  Are you enjoying the Jell-O?  Yes, she is.  That's right.  Old creaky doorman. 
[01:36:30]  Now let me give Jell-O to an oak tree and see what it says.  Ah, man.  I'm going to hell.  Casey's backing you up there, Robert.  He says, I used to be a logger planted two trees for everyone I cut down.  Yep.  There you go.  They're doing their part, I guess.  I just made that up, too.  I'm glad that someone backed me up.  Sometimes it works out.  Here we go.  A group called Earth First bewails the violation of American nature.  I want to mourn the loss of all the old growth trees I've seen. 
[01:37:00]  And tell them that we love them and that we don't want them to die.  And there are some people here who do care.  I couldn't be real.  Dude, this cannot possibly be real.  This woman needs to be committed. 
[01:37:30]  It sounds like a spokesperson for all the women living in Anthony's house.  Everyone has fun at the Chateau.  That woman needs to be on this radio show.  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We need to talk to these folks.  As a chainsaw is in the background.  Boy, is she upset at the tree being dead.  Start Googling.  Let's go.  I'm building my back deck right now.  I'd love to just put her there on the front line for her to watch a forest fire. 
[01:38:00]  Watch her just...  I backed it up.  Here we go.  And tell them that we love them and that we don't want them to die.  That there are some people here who do care.  So, I want you to know that, Drees.  That we care.  Holy crap.  Oh, my God. 
[01:38:30]  Is she for real?  Come on.  Why can't you...  Why can't, as a human, can I connect to that?  Why can't I connect to that pain?  Why does it make me laugh?  I cannot even deal.  Look at that lunatic.  I'm looking at the video of her on the monitor there.  She's just wailing, crying.  And it's never a hot chick either.  You ever notice that?  No, they're never hot.  Any girl that likes trees has unconditioned hair.  Just pale skin. 
[01:39:00]  They just suck.  Are there any, like, attractive girls at that event at all?  No.  No.  Not a one.  They'll have arthritic knuckles.  Ugh.  Oh, God.  The women of Earth First in Playboy.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  No, the paper on the page is made from trees.  Yeah, so isn't the tampon you're using.  Goodness gracious.  Yes.  Goodness gracious.  The trees are dying.  Of all the dramatic things, the oak is kind of just standing there because he knew the poison ivy is itching everybody. 
[01:39:30]  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, the trees are dying.  Wouldn't you love to be in the middle of the circle and just go, you're all fools?  Yeah.  Hey, idiots.  Yeah.  Don't sweat it.  The trees have been here.  They're going to be here long after we're gone.  That's not Lord of the Rings.  Huh?  That is a very mentally unstable person.  Yeah, but the problem is, I thought it was just going to be one. 
[01:40:00]  There's a circle of these people.  Yeah.  And as she's crying, the other ones are comforting her.  Sure.  And there's other people crying with their heads down.  There's a whole bunch of them.  Here is the, if there was a God in heaven for the biggest ironic twist ever, a rotting huge tree picks that moment after standing tall in that forest for hundreds of years to fall over and crush this woman to death.  How great would that be? 
[01:40:30]  We love you, trees!  Ah!  She's just dead.  Well, we got more.  Here we go.  I think we are deeply hurting in America.  I think we are deeply craving answers.  I think that we've lost our identity as we have evolved into technology and into industrialized society.  Bring me to this.  Back in the 1900s. 
[01:41:00]  Wasn't I reading somewhere, though, because of all the new technology, we're saving a lot of freaking trees.  Things have gotten so much better.  If you look at the early 1900s, the beginning of the industrial age, we were spewing crap out and using resources up and did not even care about what was going into the atmosphere or in the water or anything.  Now, it is more economical and, I guess, for publicity's sake, better to help the environment. 
[01:41:30]  They recycle a lot more of this stuff.  Where you used to just spew stuff out of smokestacks, they run them through intercoolers now and actually harvest the heat and the waste from it, and they can scrub it.  They run it through scrubbers and clean it.  This was something that wasn't being done years ago.  We've gotten better at it.  Look at some of the third world nations that are just starting to industrialize, like India and China, and that's who's spewing the crap out.  Go over to China and protest there and see how they treat you. 
[01:42:00]  You won't love the tree they hit you with.  It's a bamboo stick that they pull your pants down and whack your fanny with.  And plus, we have email.  Sounds good.  We have email now.  Yeah.  Less paper.  We need tree mail!  And the actual paper industry, the newspapers are going to be gone in the next 10 years.  Yeah.  We're going to have a little electronic piece of plastic that's your paper that downloads the newspaper at night.  He's like the, what's his name? 
[01:42:30]  Kreskin.  He's like the future.  It's on the internet.  Nostra dumbass.  Bobby's the future.  Google it.  It's out there.  They already have it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's a little thin piece of paper.  We're not going to, we're not doing anything anymore.  It is true.  When was the last time you actually sent out a letter or anything?  A few days ago.  Occasional bills, but yeah.  Come on, congressman.  To save the trees, Ted?  Yes.  Trees have long, we've been raping and pillaging the tree community for many years. 
[01:43:00]  An electronic piece of plastic.  We call it a computer, people are saying.  No, you jackass.  It's actually a piece of paper.  It's as thin as a piece of paper.  But it's plastic.  It's plastic.  It's thin because they have flexible screens now.  And it's just going to be, it's a thin piece of paper that you just, you bend the corner  of it and it changes the page.  Like book readers are going to be as thin as a piece of paper soon.  And then your newspaper will be as thin as a piece of paper.  You just have it at your house and it downloads the newspaper before you even wake up.  And you could read it in your flying car. 
[01:43:30]  I'm getting that from, well, I can't even say the name.  It's on YouTube.  Look it up.  All right.  We will, Bobby.  Let's get to the end of this clip here.  All this technology and into industrialized society.  Bring me to this cathedral.  Bring me to those guys.  Bring me to this rock that has the most incredible life.  That makes me feel alive.  I'd love to bring the rock to her forehead.  I looked at clear cuts and burnt forest and I felt outraged, but I didn't scream and I didn't 
[01:44:00]  cry and I need to, Oh, I could only wish that that, if she was screaming like that because  remove a hat guy was taking care of her the old fashioned way.  There's such show offs, there's such attention seekers.  Attention.  I want to beef up that clip. 
[01:44:30]  Hold on a minute.  Incredible life.  That makes me feel alive.  I've looked at clear cuts and burnt forest and I felt outraged, but I didn't scream and  I didn't cry and I need to.  Oh, here's another one of these crybabies.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  I've had a time machine.  Travis got the longer clip of them crying in the beginning of the piece.  That's what we were asking for.  Here it is. 
[01:45:30]  Deep in the woods of North Carolina.  Baby, baby, stick your head in gravy, I say.  Exactly.  Wrap it up in tree bark.  Send it to the next douche.  But what a bunch of little, God, they just notice me.  They're crying so hard.  And I should be.  I should be crying and screaming.  The trees are probably like, shut up.  Yeah.  Get out of here. 
[01:46:00]  We're trying to grow here.  Yeah.  There's bees taking dumps on them.  Trees aren't living great lives.  Bears rip them apart.  Yeah.  Trees suck.  Birds have no respect for them.  Can't run out of the way of a fire.  Yeah.  Just stand there.  We talked about that once before, didn't we?  Trees are known as the retards of the Pacific Northwest.  Just standing like big stoic lumps.  Hope the fire don't come this way.  Can't move.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  My roots, aka Tootsies, are being burned. 
[01:46:30]  You did a tree rant.  We got to find it.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy's tree rant.  How stupid trees are.  We may be fine.  Jimmy's tree rant.  If he rocks listening in the back office, maybe we could end the show with Jimmy's tree  rant.  Tree rant played over that woman crying.  Trees and fire.  Yeah.  Jimmy did a brilliant piece on that.  Sam, what's the haps?  I don't know.  What's the haps?  I don't know.  You best know the haps.  The haps is it's your birthday tomorrow.  Yeah, tomorrow.  How old is young Sam? 
[01:47:00]  I don't want to know.  Well, I don't want to know.  Well, you don't want to know because you're picturing him as 14.  Yes.  A young, hairless twink.  But he's not.  He's a grown man.  No, he's not.  I know.  I am.  But you are 25?  Five.  Five?  25.  Wow, dude.  You remember 20 like it was yesterday, right?  Yeah, it's just like these years flash before.  And that's how fast, actually faster, 30 will creep up on you. 
[01:47:30]  Really?  Oh, please.  You're halfway there.  Right, Jim?  That goes like 25 to 30.  It's like gone.  It's like going downhill.  It's just.  Oh.  And when Ope hits that, you're going to know, too.  I was going to say, it's weird that Sam's catching up to my age.  It's very strange.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll hit 30 at the same time.  I'm thinking.  I'm sure.  I'm thinking I can pull it off still.  Oh, God.  There's always that thing about, if you lie about your age, you better pick a good age.  No kidding.  Or else people are going to just go, oh, do you look lousy for that age? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I told the police I'm eight.  But I'm not.  I'm really 57 years young.  Sam, what's the haps at the RNC?  Yeah.  We meet Scotty?  Scotty, yes.  What was Scotty all about?  Well, Scotty, a lot of people had a lot of different political causes at the protest at the RNC this week.  But Scotty was with some kind of gay performance group. 
[01:48:30]  I guess they were acting out some kind of love letter to Congress or something.  Isn't that every performance group?  I guess so.  But this guy was walking around in, like, hot pants with a picture of the Virgin Mary on it.  Yeah.  Hot pants?  Yeah.  And a pink silk robe and a Pope hat with rhinestones on it.  Ah.  So I figured he'd probably have some...  He would know some haps.  Yeah.  Because I was trying to find out what's the haps with all the people there.  And so I figured Scotty would be the guy to ask.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So I'm here with Scotty at the Republican National Convention. 
[01:49:00]  Scotty, what's the haps?  Well, I'm a part of a great queer performance called Revolutionary Love 2.  I Am Your Best Fantasy.  It's a participatory democracy experiment in the form of a love letter being performed.  Wait, wait, wait.  Is this guy...  Is this guy gay?  I know he's part of the queer performing group.  Uh-huh.  Which is some kind of experiment.  It's an experiment.  Yeah.  I caught that from him.  I don't know if he's at...  What his sexual preference is.  I couldn't tell.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you can't tell just from a voice.  So I should just be quiet. 
[01:49:30]  The shorts were tight.  The best part of the clip was what he's all about.  I got lost there.  He's a...  What?  Can we go back?  Yeah, they're doing an experiment.  A performance called Revolutionary Love 2.  Yeah, listen to what he...  He explains what his group's all about.  Yeah.  All right, so I'm here with Scotty at the Republican National Convention.  Scotty, what's the haps?  Well, I'm a part of a great queer performance called Revolutionary Love 2.  I am your best fantasy.  It's a participatory democracy experiment in the form of... 
[01:50:00]  What is a participatory democracy experiment?  Experiment.  What is it?  It's a sequel.  And it's a sequel.  He said two.  Two.  Yeah.  So, you know, one was so successful they had to make the sequel.  Well, the cast of the first one completely died.  They're all just...  Participatory democracy experiment in the form of a love letter being performed by a jilted lover  to their ex who is inside. 
[01:50:30]  The walls of the Excel Center.  Isn't queer a derogatory term?  Well, queer is a word that we...  Has kind of...  A lot of the gay community has taken ownership of because it's encompassing of, like, all identities.  Gay, lesbian, transgender.  Wow.  What are you talking about?  He's babbling.  Babbling fruit.  Shut up.  It's like a rich boss that takes it in the...  Are straight people allowed to use the word queer? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  I think so.  You wouldn't have to say the Q word?  No, I think you should say, like, oh, that's my friend who's queer.  My, you know...  But I couldn't say, like, those guys are queer?  Um, not me, but I mean the typical person.  Depending on the nature of the comment, I mean, I think, yeah, I think, you know, just...  I think you can kind of identify when someone's using it as a, you know...  Could I say, like, that's a queer hat? 
[01:51:30]  Sure.  It was a queer hat.  Oh, okay.  As long as it was.  Yeah.  It has rhinestones and stuff on it.  Look at you trying to fit in.  I like it, Sam.  What do you mean?  How far did you go to fit in?  What?  I was just asking questions.  Oh, oh, I'm sorry.  What do you think of Joe Biden?  Oh, you know, I'm...  You know, I'm...  He's pretty new into my sphere of knowledge about the political arena.  Your sphere.  I'm anxious to learn more about him in the next couple weeks. 
[01:52:00]  What about this chick that John McCain has running with him?  Well, I happen to like polar bears, so...  And I hear that she also likes polar bears, but not enough to kind of, you know, manage drilling.  And I think...  What?  I'm glad she is not interested in foreign dependency on oil, but I just...  I think that there's a lot that needs preservation up in Alaska.  Do you think he's kind of queer for picking a woman to be his vice?  Do I think he's queer for doing that?  No, that doesn't seem like a queer gesture, no. 
[01:52:30]  Okay, I'm just trying to figure out how to, you know, use the word properly.  I think you need to use it to describe, like, the things of people who identify as that.  I gotcha, I gotcha.  Okay.  Well, thanks a lot, and good luck on your queer performance.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right, great.  Thanks a lot.  Did he ask for your number after that or anything?  No, he was really...  He must have loved you.  He was really upset, actually.  Was he?  I guess the whole, is John McCain queer question caught him off guard, because he really left  quickly.  But he said you could use it in any context, really. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  It was fine, and then he got upset because you were using it, and I think you thought you  were making light of him.  No, I wanted to take advantage of my opportunity to speak to somebody in the community so I could  really get the message out on how to use the word queer.  Yeah.  Well, that was educational.  Yeah, sure.  That is odd, technically.  Yes.  I love that when you hear a gay guy talk, everything in my brain is so juvenile that it's all about  him taking it.  Yeah, I don't understand.  Drilling.  You know something?  You're right.  When he said something about drilling, all I was doing was trying to concoct some kind 
[01:53:30]  of a joke in my head about drilling.  Every time a gay guy talks, I'm like, yeah, you take it.  I get it.  Yeah.  We know how you guys do it, and it looks real silly.  I went and had two hot dogs yesterday.  Did you?  I get you.  I bet you did.  Mustard on your face.  So true.  He did say drilling.  He said bear.  Yeah, polar bear.  Joe Biden entering his sphere. 
[01:54:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  Whatever you want to call it.  Sure.  Let's get Charlie in here before we take a break.  Let's do it.  You met Charlie at the RNC.  Yeah, Charlie was dressed up.  He had white face paint on and had a Grim Reaper hood on.  Oh, that's hot.  That's a hack for protesting.  But you're standing all by himself.  That's a hack costume for protesters, the Grim Reaper.  Yeah.  I actually like the new one for Scientologists, the ones that protest Scientologists.  They have that mask from that movie.  What is it?  V for Vendetta.  V for Vendetta.  You ever see those guys?  Yeah.  No.  Oh, they walk around all the time. 
[01:54:30]  I haven't seen the mask.  I haven't seen the guys, though, the protesters.  They wear the V for Vendetta mask because they don't want to be seen because they'll actually,  the Scientologists will come after them and ruin their credit and go after them and ruin  their lives.  I actually met them in San Francisco.  I took a photo.  They walk, like, eight of them walking on the street.  Do they wear, like, the cape, too, and everything?  Some of them.  And the knives?  Yeah.  Not the knife, yeah.  It's kind of like a cool movie, isn't it?  All right, so we're out here in Minnesota with Charlie.  Charlie, what's the haps?  Haps?  Yeah, what's the haps? 
[01:55:00]  What do you mean by haps?  Good.  It's like, what's the haps?  Like, what's the haps?  You mean what's happening?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I'm here to, pretty much the makeup of the show is one of two things.  One is, here, what's it say in there?  Yeah, I got it.  Two symbolic issues of the way I'm looking is, one is Green Reaper.  The other part, I would say, is the makeup shows.  A man that can't friggin' get his point across? 
[01:55:30]  Terrible carnage going on in Iraq.  Terrible carnage?  So it's two points for dressing up as a Grim Reaper.  Point one was the Grim Reaper.  Point two is terrible carnage in Iraq.  Terrible carnage.  Unbelievable.  So he's protesting the Grim Reaper.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, that's a good cause.  He's protesting death.  Yeah.  I like how Sam was annoyed that he made him say, what's happening?  Oh, that's the beauty of the bit.  He refuses to.  I love, it's rare, because most people kind of pick up on, what's the haps? 
[01:56:00]  Well, I'll tell you what's happening.  But it is rare, and I love it so much when someone just doesn't quite know, and they go,  what?  The what?  And you're like, the haps, like, you should know this.  I like when they ask me, what's the haps?  Yeah.  But I'm asking you.  I'm asking you.  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  Yeah.  The haps.  And then I said third base.  Yeah.  It's hard to have in Costello.  Charlie continues.  The sad part of this whole situation is that our politicians keep saying, well, we'll be 
[01:56:30]  out sometime next year.  No, they didn't.  They keep the timetable back.  They never put a timetable.  I'm here to say, no, they immediately make a timetable and get out now.  Immediately make a timetable and get out now.  And he said, okay, we've listened to you, and we'll get him out sometime next year.  That would be wonderful.  I think you picked up on that was what he was bothered by.  Yeah.  It's the same thing.  I love Sims. 
[01:57:00]  He's an idiot.  Sims, it's a piece of fantastic.  These people are just morons.  Well, see, there's nothing dumber than all these protesters.  They're sitting here protesting the government, and they're taking a protest route.  They're guided by police officers telling them exactly where they're allowed to march,  which is nowhere near the arena that the convention center was in.  Right.  Because they don't have credentials.  They're not allowed to even approach the convention center.  No politicians could see them.  And besides that, I was there on Monday when no politicians were even in the state. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Give us some, like, I don't know, distance that I can relate to.  Let's say we're here in Midtown.  Where would the protesters be if the Republican convention was right here?  I had to walk a half a mile.  I was dropped off at where the convention was.  So you're saying, like, from here you'd be, like, the East River or maybe the Hudson.  Yes.  You're saying, like, a half mile.  Yeah.  Like, in the old days the protesters were right out front, but not. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, that's fantastic.  They do that in New York, too.  When people want to protest, they push them across the street.  How wide is Central Park?  That's maybe a half mile.  Half mile.  Imagine being on one side of Central Park and an event you're protesting is on the other.  Yeah.  They would not even hear a peep out of you.  Of course not.  Brilliant.  We have to take a break.  Okay.  We'll play more of Sam's audio later in the show.  But after the break, we've got Big A and Roland doing the news. 
[01:58:30]  If you haven't heard Big A do the news yet, if you're one of the newbies out there, please stay right there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy, tickets?  Oh, my goodness.  Yes.  In November, I'm hitting the Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  Don't hit it.  Just perform there.  Oh, no.  I'm going to hit it.  I'm an angry young man.  And the Wilbur Theater in Boston.  So you can go to my MySpace and get tickets.  Both are on sale now.  Yeah.  Just talking football with Bobby Kelly. 
[01:59:00]  I asked him who the Pats were playing this weekend, seeing if he's up on his knowledge.  And Bobby goes, I'm not watching this year because they broke my heart, right?  Yeah.  Tom Brady, you know.  Your lover.  Yep.  What happened?  Your lover in your dreams, I should say.  I forgot what happened.  What did they do last year that broke your heart?  Geez, I can't quite remember that.  They did what they typically do.  Yeah.  They choked. 
[01:59:30]  Self-destruct.  They don't typically choke.  I know.  Wow.  That stupid model Giselle.  I got confused.  Stupid Giselle.  Still blaming Giselle in Boston?  Is that what they're doing?  Anytime somebody famous who struggles and gets their way to the top, and then they get  the hot chicks and the women bring you down, it's always hot women.  You know.  I mean.  I know.  I'm very logical with my stupidity. 
[02:00:00]  Yes.  I'm serious.  It just makes sense.  But if you really think about some of the stuff I say, it makes perfect sense.  And this is what I got for you, Bobby, and all Pats fans out there.  They're playing the Chiefs.  Yes.  They should lose on purpose.  They should lose 72 to 7.  They get a basketball game?  Because there's too much pressure now.  Everyone's thinking, you know, could they go undefeated?  And if they start getting win after win after win, then they're going to feel that same  pressure they were feeling yesterday, and they're going to blow it again. 
[02:00:30]  It's too much pressure.  So they should get a loss out of the way immediately.  I'm telling you.  It would be the best thing for the Pats, and then they're going to destroy everybody and  win another Super Bowl.  You're predicting they're going to win the Super Bowl again?  I'm just saying.  It would be crazy for them to try to get another undefeated season together.  It would be insane.  It's a good point.  Thank you.  It's a good point.  I just can't wait to see Brady in his uniform.  He is a big fan, isn't he? 
[02:01:00]  He's so presidential.  I got the Jets and, of course, the Dolphins.  Got Chad throwing for the fish.  They got Brett throwing for the Jets.  It's going to be a good game.  Game of the week, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Game of the week.  With the Jets?  And the Dolphins.  It's going to be the worst game of the week.  Who's going to win?  The Jets are going to win.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  But they got Brett Favre, but he's finished, too.  He's going to give them two above-average years, and then he's going to go into the Hall 
[02:01:30]  of Fame as a Packer.  That's what happens with these guys.  And I'm a Jets fan.  There's excitement all over the place.  Brett Favre, jerseys everywhere, but that's how it's going to end.  He has to go in as a Jet.  Only talk about these two seasons.  What if he ends up winning the Super Bowl for the Jets?  Then he's got a problem.  Then he's got a problem.  Maybe he goes in with the Packers jersey and a Jets helmet.  I don't know.  Yeah.  All mixed up.  All messed up.  I only refer to Green Bay as a bunch of cheese-eating clear. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, we're running out of show, unfortunately.  In studio, we got Big A.  What's up, Big A?  Nothing much.  How you guys doing?  All right.  Good.  Why am I looking at a picture of you with your gut hanging out, and it looks like you're  passed out?  Oh, my God.  I thought that was Colin.  I swear to God.  What?  What is that picture from, Big A, that I'm going to take a picture of and put on onaradio.com?  What is that?  I have no idea.  You look passed out. 
[02:02:30]  Where is that, Danny?  Oh.  Yes.  Oh.  Sorry, Danny.  That's okay.  Eric's telling me that Big A was staying at a friend's house in Boston or whatever.  Was he babysitting?  He just fell asleep on the couch, and obviously with his shirt up past his stomach, so they  decided to take a picture of him.  Wowie.  It's disturbing there.  You're not comfortable with that picture, are you?  You don't want everybody looking at that.  Not really.  It's a little bit too late, right?  Like you're some slumbering animal. 
[02:03:00]  Hey, Big A.  They just caught your bad side with that picture.  Just remember, I've always been nice to you.  Just remember that.  You're the candy, right?  When you finally do snap, you start just breaking these guys' necks like chickens.  All you got to do is run.  I'm not going to run.  What's he going to do?  Chase you?  Can you run fast?  No.  No, of course not.  Used to be able to, right?  In your old football days.  Yep.  You ever seen pictures of a young Big A?  No.  Just your normal run-of-the-mill high school football player guy. 
[02:03:30]  Did he have the same brain?  Handsome fella.  He was the same guy?  You talk the same, too?  Yeah, you still sounded like an idiot, but at least he looked, though, right?  How many times can I throw that ball in the air before somebody hit it?  Well, let's not forget, though, Big A didn't actually play football.  He has a championship ring because he was the equipment manager.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, he was the water boy?  God, water boy, yeah.  I want you to think of something Bobby, Bob, Bob, Bob, my mama, my mama said.  All right, we're running out of show. 
[02:04:00]  We got Roland, of course.  He's going to do some news, too.  And people might remember that Roland does a terrific job with tragic news.  So we mixed in some of the top stories of the day with some tragic stories.  That's how this is going to work today, Danny?  Right.  Right on.  All right.  Let's start the news with Big A, everyone.  Um...  Um...  Us...  Us...  Us...  Us... 
[02:04:30]  Us...  Us...  Us...  Us...  Us...  Us...  Up.  Everything, everyone.  It's time to...  On your day with me, Big A.  And me, Roland.  Jesus, man.  It's like a car stuck in the mud that finally gets traction. 
[02:05:00]  It's so hard to watch.  It's so uncomfortable.  I've talked to people.  They say they actually stopped breathing listening to this bit.  On last Thursday, Major League Baseball...  I started reviewing home run calls after installing the instant replay. 
[02:05:30]  A super star, Alex Rodriguez, who is accustomed to how she blasted a home run, which he hit the fell pole and left.  The blast, which was unmistakably, the German home run was reviewed. 
[02:06:00]  Dude, anyhow, baseball is one of the last sports to institute the use of instant replay. 
[02:06:30]  You didn't say the last word.  The last two words.  Instant replay.  Oh, my God.  I'd hate to be his kid.  Daddy, will you read me a bedtime story?  Oh, the sun's coming up.  We only have five stories to go, by the way.  Wow.  Yeah.  An Indiana man allegedly killed his girlfriend, six-week-old kitten, in a fit of rage last week after she said...  A what?  A fit of rage. 
[02:07:00]  No, a six-week-old what?  Kitten.  Kitten?  A what?  Kitten.  Kitten?  Meow.  Meow.  That's love.  Okay, I'm kidding.  Kitten?  All right.  Kitten?  I don't know.  Kitten?  A fit of rage last week after she said...  She was leaving him.  She said her boyfriend, 21-year-old Zachariah White, was drunk and had to punch the walls in the refrigerator after she told him she was ending the relationship.  She asked him if he thought he was Muhammad Ali. 
[02:07:30]  Why allegedly responded, I'm not Muhammad Ali.  I'm Zach White.  The tied-in for the Winchester's Golden Falcons.  According to the Star Press, White then allegedly picked up the kitten named Spot and punched it into the ceiling fan.  He punted the kitten into the ceiling fan?  Yeah, pretty much.  The cat later euthanized. 
[02:08:00]  White who had a black hole level of .89 when he was arrested and was charged with animal cruelty and public intoxication.  Hee-hee!  What a trooper.  Jesse Jackson had to stop campaigning in Georgia this week when he was hospitalized for us. 
[02:08:30]  For stomach pains on Wednesday.  Jackson said his stomach is really much better.  And that he has viral gas control and enteritis. 
[02:09:00]  He says he does not know how long he will be stuck in the hospital.  Because doctors are still doing tests on his stomach. 
[02:09:30]  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  That should be the whole show every day.  Oh.  66-year-old Nick Nauelio was punched in the face so badly he collapsed and died along the street on Wednesday night.  Hee-hee-hee-hee.  Nauelio was well-known in the neighborhood and the woman apparently asked him to walk her home because someone was acting suspicious. 
[02:10:00]  A man walked up to the pair in Crescent Avenue and started punching Nauelio reportedly.  Hee-hee-hee-hee.  Reportedly?  Reportedly.  Repeatedly.  Oh, well, he's dead.  Uh, police arrested the suspect in the attack but have not released any information on his identity.  Hee-hee-hee.  Hee-hee-hee-hee.  He's dead.  Tropicals.  Bumps.  Bumps. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, boy.  Bumps.  Oh, boy.  Calm Hannah is set to make his way up the eastern coastline over the weekend.  And the forecast is us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  What's happening to you?  Us.  Us. 
[02:11:00]  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  We'll be, um, um, uh, um, uh, we'll be strong.  With maximum pain was hitting 65 miles per hour.

[02:13:00]  How did you forget that?  Alright, we're almost done.  Eleven hellish bodies bearing signs of torture were dumped in a field on the outskirts of the city of...  Merida?  A 12th body was found 50 miles away.  Police say all 12 men were decapitated alive...  Although the heads of the victims have not yet been found.  Hehehehe...  Hehehehe...  The still undefined men were found naked...  Bound according to Reuters... 
[02:13:30]  Branded with the letter Z...  Suggesting the notorious Zeta...  Hitsquad may have been behind all the killings...  More than 2700 people have been killed in Mexico so far this year...  While kidnapping rates have soared paths of Colombia and Iraq...  Hehehehe...  Hehehehe...  Hehehehe...  Hehehehe...  Hehehehe...  Hehehehe...  What just happened, Roland?  Mexico?  Mexico...  Boy...  Where?

Happy birthday to primetime, Sam Roberts.  Ah, here we are. 
[02:19:00]  XM Satellite Sirius.  Nope.  No, it's Sirius XM.  Sirius Satellite XM Radio I'm going to go with today.  Yes.  I think that's what it is, Ant.  Yeah.  Sirius Radio XM Satellite thingy.  Thing.  We got a live crowd out there.  Hey, everybody.  How are you today?  It's Friday.  That means we get the big crowd.  Yes, they waged it first.  We get the big crowd on Friday. 
[02:19:30]  Attention Sirius.  This is what we do.  Why don't you start taking notice?  We have live audiences on our show.  There's a guy out there who dropped a dumbbell on his toe and his whole toenail ripped off.  Really?  Yeah.  Nice.  Very nice.  He just easily just said, Iraq stepped on us.  Dumbbell.  I told Iraq when he was telling me what was going on at the hospital, Jimmy, that you were  a huge fan and it made him almost tear up.  Go, Iraq?  I go, Iraq, Jimmy's a huge fan of what you do for this radio show. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  He knows that.  I've told him that.  Iraq is, he's an odd dichotomy of things.  He is a bungler slash irreplaceable.  Yeah, absolutely.  No, it's funny.  Kenny walked in and looked at Master Poe and said, please don't hurt me.  I found it funny.  The 25 people outside did.  No, no.  I'm a little distracted. 
[02:20:30]  We have a celebrity here.  I just want to get this out of the way because I am a bit starstruck.  All right.  Pablo Picasso?  Linger a day.  My favorite song happens to be an old Oliver song.  Uh-huh.  And I understand that we have someone who actually can do it.  Yes.  I have to hear.  Consider yourself live.  Yeah, yeah, that's a very famous song from Oliver. 
[02:21:00]  From, uh, Oliver.  You might remember.  Actually, this is, like, probably the most popular song.  Yes.  From Oliver.  And a lot of times, this is, of course, Baby Girl, and you don't hear it in the organic  British accent.  No, no.  Which I know that she does.  No.  Um, and I would love a live...  See, I can't do it on the spot because I know I'm going to say it right.  Like, not wrong on purpose.  No, no, I'm sure you won't.  Well, say it right.  That's fine.  Yeah, you've got to give it a shot. 
[02:21:30]  You know, coincide yourself at home.  No.  No, you've got to do it right.  Oh, my God.  Don't be shy.  Coincide yourself at home.  Oh, my God.  She was actually in a play or something?  You were in a play?  When I was little.  When you were little.  Who did you play?  Just an orphan.  Just one of the orphans?  And at one point, did you have to sing the big line?  Yeah.  No, well, that was more during practice, like when we were practicing it. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah?  During the show, I think I did it right.  So what did you do?  You stepped up and you went, and give it your all.  Give it your all.  Close your eyes.  I really can't.  Turn down the lights.  Maybe make her a little more comfortable.  Oh, you can absolutely, I'm sure.  Let's get her comfortable.  What was your dance move?  Did you have to do something like a step or whatever?  What did you do?  Or did your arm have to swing back and then forward and go, coin city yourself?  Yeah.  How did?  Come on.  I really don't remember.  Go back and talk about this.  But if you'd like me to do that, I'll do it for you.  I would love you to.  Yeah.  All right.  Give us a good accent.  Make it loud. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  I think you got it.  Danny, you should dim them down, and then when she comes in, you should bring them up  like a real play.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  That's true.  Wait, should she have a cordless mic so she has a little, you're okay?  No, I think I'm good, yeah.  Spit the gum out, too, so you can get that queen really good.  Yeah, just spit it on the floor.  Come here, sweetie.  No, it's all right.  He said Dave will eat it later.  No, she might be nervous on the air.  Chewing it helps keep you moist on the air.  Yeah.  Chewing it will fuck it up.  Let her spit it in your hand, Bobby.  Dude, I better spit it in my mouth.  I know.  Well, I know. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, you helped me out.  Yeah, I was helping you out.  So, what was the dance move you wanted me to do?  Well, it's like, it's just your fist has to go coin city.  Yeah, yeah, you know exactly what it is.  Of course you do.  It's natural.  And that's during the big, long, drawn-out coin, because that's English for consider  yourself as coin.  Wait, no, no, can you?  But I think part of it, though, should be that, like, while she's doing it, the leg  has to come up a little bit.  Like, what, coin city yourself?  Oh, yeah, you can kind of stomp a little.  Yeah.  Like, it's got to be like the left arm back, like you're going tall. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, tall.  How would you describe that?  Kind of like a, oh, yeah.  Like you're crossing your body with your arm, like, oh, rats.  And the one leg should be lifted up.  It should be really a bubbling burst to consider yourself.  Yeah, perfect.  A little more pep.  Feel it.  Go?  Yes.  Wait, wait, wait.  The lights are going to come on.  Nice and loud.  Project to the audience.  You have to project.  Yes, yes.  Nice and loud.  Should she face the audience?  And no talking.  You've got to sing it. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, face the audience.  Yeah.  Okay.  This is for them.  Good?  Yes.  Perfect.  Coins.  Consider yourself at home.  Oh, my God.  Is that good?  Coins.  She wants out of this studio so bad.  Oh, I know.  So bad.  So uncomfortable.  If I knew this was going to happen, I definitely would have came in.  Where is that accent from?  Is that the British one?  Well, I think when I was little, well, still now, I guess, I can't do accents or anything 
[02:24:30]  talk.  Really?  I'm dumb.  Yeah.  No.  Coins.  Consider yourself.  It's supposed to be consider yourself.  Yeah, but like my British accent would be like, would you like a cup of tea?  That was better.  That was all right.  It's better than Bob's.  Oh.  I don't know.  Not you, Bob.  Not Bob.  No, no.  British Bob.  Of course.  British Bob.  That wasn't as bad.  See?  Yeah.  That was almost British.  Say crumpet in a British accent.  No, I can't.  Just try it.  I can't say it in English.  Just say it. 
[02:25:00]  Just say it.  Oh, my God.  She's squirming.  She's nervous.  Why are you so nervous?  You've been on the air before.  I know, but I have to.  You're making fun of me.  You know everybody here.  You're amongst friends.  You're amongst friends, Ricky.  Hey, we got a little song for her.  Oh.  Come, city, yourself.  At home.  Wow, you're doing it good now.  Come, city, yourself.  I want to have a family.  Let's have her.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's have her sing along. 
[02:25:30]  No, no, that's all right.  It's all right.  I've got to go to the bathroom.  So I'll see you all later.  Danny, get her some headphones.  Do it in the studio.  Everyone else does it.  Could you hold your hand out and let me just see your hand?  Hold your hand straight out.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  A little shaky.  Wait, we got headphones so she can sing along to the song?  Yeah.  Sing along.  What's wrong with you?  Come on.  You'll love this.  We need a little cabaret here for peace sake.  You'll love this.  She's freaking out.  No, Marissa, you can do it. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, you'll love this.  Listen, Marissa.  Coin, city yourself.  I know.  At home.  Yeah, just listen to it.  Just sing as much as you can, all right?  This really is an entertaining radio.  It is.  No, it really isn't.  Beyond comprehension.  Yeah, it's wonderful.  Sing along to the song.  Here we go.  No, I'm not singing along.  Oh, sing along.  Sing along.  Here we go.  Come, city yourself.  At home.  You forgot the good part.  That's all she does.  I really don't know the words.  We'll print an apple. 
[02:26:30]  No, Danny.  Oh, my God.  And Danny is uninvited to the barbecue.  He's printing it out.  You having a barbecue this weekend?  What barbecue?  Oh, I'm going to mess up with this barbecue.  There's a little barbecue happening at the house.  You having another barbecue?  It's a little party.  You said it yesterday.  Yeah.  What are you celebrating?  There was going to be a nothing, really.  Just having a barbecue?  What kind of food?  Just having a little barbecue.  What kind of food?  I don't know.  They're going shopping. 
[02:27:00]  I'm there.  What are you getting?  I bring cupcakes.  Like burgers?  London broil.  London broil?  Get some turkey burgers.  I can't eat London broil.  Are you coming?  Yes.  Is the hot tub going to be hot this time?  Let's hope so.  If not, it gets a fucking doo-doo in it.  Does not?  Someone's having a little shit.  Coin City, a hot tub.  Hot toilet.  Is this the two-day barbecue that we heard about?  Yeah.  This is going to be a tropical storm party.  Tropical storm party.  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Because the tropical storm is supposed to hit us over the weekend.  And it's going to make lousy weather.  But we don't care.  We're barbecuing and hot tubbing.  Why are you getting a London broil?  Huh?  London broil is good for a barbecue.  If you're a...  But for when?  No one likes London broil.  London broil, you're fucking...  London broil stinks.  It's got no bones and it slices on a bias.  Get a fucking hamburger on a fucking...  A bias?  Who needs that?  I don't like juice.  Slice me.  I don't like racist food.  Get some filet. 
[02:28:00]  Mignon.  Or New York strip steak.  There'll be all types of meat for the barbecue.  Get some knock worst.  Knock worst?  They'll put you a big fat hog on the grill.  Just throw it on the grill?  Throw it on the grill.  I see grill marks in your fat helmet.  That's actually a video on YouTube.  There's some guy that does barbecue his dick, but we think it's all fake.  Yeah, we don't think it's real.  It is, you know, fake.  We're going to have to decide Dave to do it for real.  It's not real.  Yeah.  No, this one is real.  Okay, it's fake. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, it's a fucking video of Steve being fired.  This one's real.  It's on YouTube.  Terribly embarrassing.  Coing, right?  He's printing out the words.  All right.  I'm not singing it.  Why wouldn't you sing it, though?  Yeah, why?  You did it, man.  How old were you when you did the play?  Eight, ten, I don't know.  How old are you now?  Twenty-eight.  Yeah, so you did the play, and you weren't nervous then, right?  No.  Aw.  But I suck, and I know I suck now, so there's no.  I think you're great.  I think you're doing awesome. 
[02:29:00]  Everyone wants to hear it.  You got a gift.  Why don't you share your gift?  You can't keep a gift bottled up like that.  It's really not a gift.  No, not really.  You already say the first part.  Just do the first part with the song, the Queen City Yourself.  I love that.  She has no clue what to do with her hands right now.  They're in her back pocket, they're in her back pocket, they're in her front pocket, on her hips, down, up.  I'm not doing this.  All right, we got the words.  I'm not doing this.  She's got the words.  All right, here it is.  There we go.  There you go.  Just focus. 
[02:29:30]  This is easy.  The sooner you do it, you'll be off the hook, you'll be out of here.  Yeah, it's just a little song.  And then we'll get into some cake farting.  Yeah, we all like singing.  Cake farting live.  How about just the first line?  The first couple.  No, first couple.  Just go as far as you can.  Just go, seriously go, just go as far as you can.  Yeah, here we go.  Here it is.  Coin City Yourself, at home, Coin City Yourself, one of the family.  Yes.  Come on. 
[02:30:00]  Here you go.  Oh, wait, she's falling apart.  What happened?  Hold on, you're way behind.  What's up?  She's so uncomfortable.  I can't even handle it.  Unfortunately, we're going to...  I would never do this to you.  That's all I've got to say.  Oh, no.  Unfortunately, we're going to have to start over because she fell way behind.  Yeah.  You were doing great, though.  By the way, Jimmy Norton invited you in here to sing this.  I love Coin City Yourself.  I think it's organic.  Yeah, I wouldn't have said no either because it's a great song. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, I can't do it.  I can't.  Coin City Yourself.  Yeah, I don't do it right.  Coin City Yourself.  All right, let's try it one more time from the top.  All right, here we go.  Here's the song.  One more time.  Coin City Yourself.  I can't do it.  Wait a minute.  You're doing great.  Family.  We've taken to you.  So strong.  All right, I'm done.  Where? 
[02:31:00]  She's like Uncle Paul would love this kid.  Of course I do.  A part of the family.  Let's hear it for Baby Girl.  Yes, very good, Baby Girl.  At least we got a little bit there.  A little bit of Coin City Yourself.  She just mouthed I hate you.  Sam, sit down for a second.  It's your birthday tomorrow, right?  Uh-oh.  Are we bringing the cop in that isn't really a cop?  It's a dancer.  It's a guy who mouth fucks him. 
[02:31:30]  Coin City Yourself.  A queer.  Are you on mic there, Sam?  Coin City Yourself.  A pocket pussy.  Yeah.  Whipped cream on his hard cock and Sam's going to suck it off.  And it turns out just to be a real cop, not a dancer.  Prime time Sam Roberts.  His birthday is tomorrow.  We got just, you know, you're one of the underlings, so we got one surprise for you.  Okay.  You know, you're not one of the big stars, so you don't get a whole show of surprises.  You get one little one.  You don't get faggity chubby checker crooning to you.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, God, that's right. 
[02:32:00]  Fucking awful.  I forgot about that.  Fucking rotten queen.  Chubby changed the way everybody danced.  Really?  Did he?  Chubby changed the way people have sex with, like, other men in the ass?  Fucking fruit.  Instead of chubby checker, it should be upper decker, because that's what he likes.  Fucking nice log on his face.  We've had it with chubby.  Chubby checker should cut off his feet with a lawnmower.  How about a second hit, huh?  It's been 40 some odd years.  It's about time.  What do we got on the phone for Primetime Sam Roberts? 
[02:32:30]  It's a surprise.  Sam, your surprise is on the phone.  Hello?  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday from Mick Foley.  Whoa.  Happy birthday to you.  Look at that, Sam, huh?  It's Mick.  Good guess. 
[02:33:00]  How's it going?  How's it going, Mick?  Good, Sam.  Hey, that was at least a good rendition as Consider Yourself, Emily.  Well, how are you doing?  How's everything?  This is quite a surprise.  Good surprise?  Very good surprise.  All right.  Well, hey, the last time I was asked to call in for somebody's birthday, it was Christy  Canyon's radio show.  So you're in good company.  Oh.  And we know how much you like Christy Canyon there.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah.  Canyon, I should say, yes. 
[02:33:30]  The porn girl?  The porn girl, yeah.  I love her.  She's like mid-80s.  She's great.  She's old school porn.  Yeah, yeah.  Not from the 80s.  Yeah, Christy Canyon was sexy.  Sure.  What was her big movie there, Mick Foley?  Uh, you know, I'm strictly the guy who's got the one best of Christy Canyon tape hidden  down there in a dresser drawer.  But I know there was Portrait of Christy.  There was the talk show, which was a takeoff of talk shows, which was quite, you know, quite 
[02:34:00]  a feeling.  So, you know, she's legendary in those circles, but I'm strictly a best of guy.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Do you come with any news for Anthony?  Anthony today, because you were the one that starred that whole thing.  Why does this always have to come up?  What kind of news?  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yes.  First of all, Anthony, I'm sorry I missed the barbecue.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, there was a big party and everything. 
[02:34:30]  You invited Mick.  Well, of course, Mick was invited.  He's going to live in New York.  Sorry.  Why didn't you go to the big shindig there, Mick?  You know, it's right around there.  I had a little career change.  Right.  We heard something was going on.  Yeah.  JBL blew up your spot the other day.  He said you're going to be with TNA, it looks like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to be starting there pretty soon.  I'm pretty excited about it.  And also flattered that apparently I'm the first guy to ever be taken down from the WWE 
[02:35:00]  alumni website.  Holy shit.  But you're like a guy.  Vince McMahon doesn't play.  When you leave the organization, you're dead.  Yeah.  I thought it was bad enough.  I went up to my wife.  I said, I've got some bad news.  And she goes, you're kidding.  She knows whenever I say bad news, I'm usually kidding.  I said, I've been taking off the Legends of WrestleMania game.  She said, no, because she knows that that could be a pretty decent royalty. 
[02:35:30]  Sure.  And I understood that one.  But last night, I just learned to use the internet yesterday.  So it was up to like 4.30, like punching in like Steve Forbert tour dates, for example.  Of course.  Yeah.  In your first day, you've got to punch in the Steve Forbert tour date.  And he's playing at Joe's Pub on Friday in Manhattan.  Okay.  But anyway, I saw that I said, let me type in Mick Foley TNA and see what comes up, see 
[02:36:00]  what people are saying about me.  And it turns out, you know, Reliable Source said I had first been moved off the active SmackDown  roster to the alumni files.  And I guess as of yesterday, I was erased from the alumni files.  Jesus.  Why are you leaving?  You know, just, you got, who's current there with WWE?  I am, Jim Norton.  Okay.  You know, I was announcing for a while and sometimes, you know, something just doesn't 
[02:36:30]  feel right, just doesn't, you know, give you a feeling of fulfillment when you do it.  And that was the case.  I got to stop you.  I got to stop you.  All right.  Stop me.  Because you're being a little polite.  According to JBL, you didn't like the fact that Vince was yelling in your ear as you're  trying to announce these matches.  Well, here's the thing.  Vince is yelling, yeah, Mick Foley.  Mick, you're doing it all wrong.  You suck. 
[02:37:00]  Supposedly, the chatter in your ear got to you after a while.  Vince trying to, like, tell you what to do while you're doing it.  You know, this is cool because usually when I'm on, we can have a little fun at Vince's  expense.  And it doesn't, it makes me seem kind of like an independent guy because I'm willing to  poke fun at my boss.  But now that he's not my boss, I'm worried that if I, you know, if I say something derogatory,  that'll be, you know, construed as derogatory, bitter.  Right.  But if you guys say that it's because he was yelling at me and saying things like, 
[02:37:30]  okay, say it, say it, say it.  Mick, Mick, it's Vince, I'm in your ear.  What the hell do you think you're doing?  Say, say, everything I say.  Just say it.  I'm fantastic.  Vince McMahon is the best, the greatest.  I don't care who you're talking to.  Just say it or you're...  You know, I did, I did ask JBL after I found a job for about three months. 
[02:38:00]  I was like, you know, you announced here for a couple of years.  He said, yeah.  And I said, this thing with Vince in your ear, you know, does it get any better?  And he told me that, you know, it was definitely a concern to him.  And so once I realized that it was not really, you know, that that's not an option.  And I'll give Vince a lot of credit.  I think he specifically was gentler with me than he was with other people.  But, you know, in the end, it's his show. 
[02:38:30]  You know, he can, you know, he can produce whichever way he likes.  But for me...  What kind of stuff was he yelling?  You know, he only...  He didn't yell at me that much.  It's just those moments he did kind of stood out and made it hard to enjoy the show.  So that, you know, there were times, a couple times, like the episode where Edge and Vicky Guerrero got married.  Where, you know, ten minutes into the show, I'm sitting there thinking, how am I going to get through these two hours without walking out? 
[02:39:00]  You know?  So I...  Were they suggestions on what to say?  Or was it...  Like, what would he...  What's an example of what would be something he would say that would be like, oh, God?  Um, well, it would be the difference between saying, how about we lay out here and saying, lay out, damn it.  Lay out!  Oh, I gotcha.  You know, laying out means, you know, don't, you know, let the action speak for itself. 
[02:39:30]  Right.  And, man, it just...  Yeah, instead of, why don't you lay out, it's...  Shut the fuck up, Mick!  Let the fucking action do the talking!  You're a borefest!  You know, like, when I was writing, for example, you know, surely, you know, it was, you know, an editor could look at it and then tell me where I'd gone wrong.  But that's a lot different than being told while you're writing it that what you're writing stopped. 
[02:40:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Change it!  And, you know, one of the reasons I laughed when I did was that, man, you know, I still, I do, I do like Vince.  You might not be able to tell from the last few minutes, but that was quickly changing, you know.  And I had had a great run there, you know, really enjoyed my time and it had been, you know, good to me beyond my wildest hopes. 
[02:40:30]  And I kind of wanted to get away while I still felt very positive about everything.  So, uh, I think I did things the right way.  I kind of went out with a bang and, uh, you know, I'm looking to start something different.  So basically what you're trying to say is, uh, you know, you're, you've had it with Vince and the WWE and you don't mind, uh, burning a bridge.  And that you have moved on and you don't need Vince anymore.  I don't think that bridge was burned until I called in this morning. 
[02:41:00]  Well, we'll help you out there.  No, it was, uh, you know, it was, it was cool.  And, uh, I thought it was, you know, I thought it was cool.  Um, and I did, you know, I talked to everybody on the way out and, uh, I've seen people leave on a lot worse terms.  I try to do it the right way.  And I'm sure there's a, you know,  I got a couple of bad jokes there that I just won't say.  Hey, um, do you, do you, do you coin city yourself like lucky?  Yes. 
[02:41:30]  Of course.  Norton.  Yes.  Norton.  Yes.  Well, why do you ask Jim?  Just because I mean, like you, you're leaving on weird terms.  Um, and you're not, you're going to be considered like a part of the family.  Wow.  I like, I like how you're tying that in.  Of course.  Are you singing for me?  No, no, no.  I always tie it in the spoken word.  Yeah.  Any, uh, any, any final thoughts, uh, that you have about the WWE before Vince showed you the, uh, the door and threw you on the curb there?  No, he didn't show me the door. 
[02:42:00]  I think, um, I saw the door.  I wanted to open it.  Mick, Mick, it's Vince.  See that door?  Walk through it and leave your mic behind.  And keep walking.  That's right.  That's right, you team walker.  No, you know, the final thoughts, it was, it was great.  Uh, I, uh, loved being part of it.  Uh, but, uh, I sensed that, uh, you know, there was not much more I could do there.  Once, you know, once you've been the announcer, uh, and you realize that, you know, when that's through. 
[02:42:30]  Buff my ass!  Buff my ass, Mick Foley!  I'm trying to be a diplomat.  Are you?  Diplomat.  Are you trying to say that?  It's difficult.  Are you trying to say that Vince, uh, McMahon is a motherfucker?  Wow!  I don't think he's trying to say that.  No.  No.  This Mick Foley, he's lost body parts for this Vince McMahon.  Uh, that's true.  You know.  Uh.  And he should at least leave you on websites and stuff.  Yeah, that's true. 
[02:43:00]  Uh, they could have left me hanging on the website.  Um, but, uh, listen, like I said, it was great.  And just when I come in from now on, um, you guys will have to do all the Vince-isms,  and I'll just kind of blink twice for no and once for yeah.  Ah, absolutely.  Well, I gotta tell you how things work around here.  And now that you're not part of the WWE, ah.  Oh, Jesus.  He's still Mick Foley, uh, you know, author.  Who was there for you guys?  Who reached out when you guys were off the air? 
[02:43:30]  Triple H.  The Dudleys, um, who else?  Yeah, let's see.  Uh, the Blue Meanie, I think, gave me a call.  Uh, Killer Kowalski before he dropped dead.  Aw, poor Killer.  Um, who else?  Who else?  No, of course.  Mick's always been there.  He's a stand-up guy.  Well, hey, I appreciate it.  And, uh, you know, I wouldn't have gone to TNA if I didn't, uh, think that it was, uh,  you know, a show and a group on the rise.  And, uh, we're gonna be, or they're going to be in Long Island tonight and Manhattan tomorrow. 
[02:44:00]  And I'll probably, I'll be starting sometime soon.  So I just hope, uh, some of the fans, uh, who liked what I did on WWE will kind of, uh...  Basically what he's saying is, you know, if Vince didn't show him the door, he wouldn't know what TNA was doing.  Oh my God, you are...  Well, I think that Mick probably got a good money offer.  Mick's a great asset to the company, because he's a huge name.  Yep.  And, uh, yeah.  He wasn't gonna be yelled at.  Are you gonna be announcing for them?  Are you gonna get in the ring a little bit, too?  Well, you know what, we haven't really determined, uh, what the role is, uh, but I did say, I said, look... 
[02:44:30]  I've tapped into your earphone here at TNA.  Thought you could get away from me, didn't you, Mick?  I hijacked the line.  I hacked it myself.  And I'm gonna be talking in your ear now, too.  No one admits he's gonna just buy the whole TNA thing just so he can fire you again.  Just so he can talk in your ear.  Right.  Hey, what does lay out mean?  That just means don't talk?  Yeah, it just says shut up.  Lay out means let the action speak for itself. 
[02:45:00]  You know what, if anyone remembers that, uh, episode, it was really good, but at a certain  point, uh, Edge and Vicky were doing, uh, uh, their first dance as a married couple, and  they actually had a, a live, uh, a duo singing, and they sang a full song.  It went on for like three and a half, four minutes, and I'm sitting there two minutes into  this thing saying, if I don't point out the absurdity of this, you know, like, it needs  to be addressed, um, and, and, you know, what happens is once you start getting, you  know, hammered, even if it's not that regularly, you start doubting your own, you know, your 
[02:45:30]  own timing, wisdom, and I'm sitting there like, I need to say something, like, Jerry Lawler  would definitely say something here.  I've watched the show, you know, for, you know, 20 years, I know that you're supposed  to say something here, and I just kind of chimed in with, wow, this is, this is really  a special moment, which is, you know, seems pretty tame, and, uh, really got the, uh,  the unleashing.  Really?  Just from that?  Uh, what's that?  Just from that?  Just, just from that, yeah. 
[02:46:00]  What was the unleashing?  Well, you know, it, like I said, it was, it was just the words layout, followed by damn  it, but that in a way that made me want to leave the arena.  Wow.  You know, in honor of that, uh, sorry, Sam, we're boycotting, uh, the WWE.  What?  Yeah, for, for at least, at least a month or so.  Why can't we have WWE guests in, Mick Foley in?  That doesn't work that way.  Nope.  Because Sam is thumbs downing you while we're talking.  No! 
[02:46:30]  And we don't like it at all.  Sam's very disloyal.  No, that's not true.  I say Mick Foley is the only TNA guest allowed on the Opie and Anthony show.  Lay back!  Lay down!  Lay off!  Shut up!  Sit down, Sam!  Sam, I don't mean to put...  I'm gonna do this to Sam every day now.  Just talk on like this.  Shut up!  Cut your hair, you look ridiculous!  Sam, I don't mean to put you in a bad spot, but I'm going to.  You know, because...  You're Jim's ass? 
[02:47:00]  One bad spot.  You're, uh, you know, Mick Foley loves you.  He called you for your birthday.  He's not with the WWE anymore.  I need you to say something bad about Vince McMahon and the WWE in honor of Mick Foley's firing.  Say it, Sam.  Okay.  Say it, damn it!  I think Vince McMahon made a mistake in letting Mick Foley go.  There you go.  Wow.  All right.  Yeah.  Wow, easy on the harshness.  We didn't mean that crazy.  Well, you know something?  Knowing the WWE, he'll be back. 
[02:47:30]  Come on, you little twink.  They bring everybody back every so often.  They really do.  Mick will be back.  Yeah.  He'll be forced to share a hotel room with Dusty Rhodes.  And his voiders.  Ow.  Well, Mick.  Hey, well, listen, Sam, I just called in for happy birthday.  I'm glad I get a couple of these things off my chest, but honestly, it was a good move,  and it was time to make the move, and I wish WWE and Vince nothing but the best, seriously. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, I wish I could see your face as you're saying that.  Hey, are you doing an A&E reality show?  You know what?  They came into my home several months ago for like eight days, 16 hours a day, and we did  a pilot, and everybody involved thought it was going really well.  But on day two, I got like a little feedback that the people at the station were concerned  there wasn't enough conflict in the family. 
[02:48:30]  So did you hit your wife?  You're getting along too well.  What are you doing?  Start knocking her around a bit.  Shake one of your kids.  Oh, God.  So much for reality, though.  Yeah, you know, hey, I was told when I addressed that, I said, well, you know, we're not really  a family that yells at each other, because I know that's kind of what, you know, from  looking at a little bit of reality here and there, that's kind of what they want.  A lot of stuff that looks staged to me, they said, no, that's, you know, that's passe.  We think it's time for like a new type of family on TV. 
[02:49:00]  And first of all, there's conflict in every family, and if you look for it, it's there.  It doesn't have to be so bold as, you know, as like you said, yelling or smacking.  Yeah, having sex with one of your daughter's friends.  Real conflict.  Jeez.  But I was actually relieved, you know, I'm glad I tried it so that we're not sitting  there saying, I wonder what would have happened if we tried that, you know, reality thing.  We tried it, you know, they paid us pretty well for the week, and it was really a cool 
[02:49:30]  experience.  We got great home movies out of it, but I don't think I'd want the cameras in my house all  the time.  You know, I don't think that, and I'm not saying this, I'm not saying this to be mean or sarcastic  or anything, but I don't really think it's worked out well for the Hogans, you know.  Dude, I fucking hate that show.  And it's on its third or fourth season at this point.  Yeah, it's doing really big ratings.  And another concern I have...  It's fake, it's scripted, it's awful. 
[02:50:00]  And this is hard for me to say, because I'm a Hulkamaniac.  Well, you know what, it was important to me that it not be scripted, and the whole time  they were there, the eight days for 16 hours, it was only like one line I said that, you  know, they wanted me to say that didn't feel natural.  And when they came back six weeks later, it was weird, because I had to talk about a comeback  match that it already had, as if it hadn't happened yet.  And then there was a lot of things they wanted to do to bridge the gaps, and it kind of, you 
[02:50:30]  know, at that point, it kind of felt like acting.  So, yeah, I mean, we were glad we tried it.  You know, I recommend a reality show pilot for any family to try, but honestly, you know,  when I look at, you know, what A&E has on there, and believe me, it's kind of humbling  to realize that they green-lighted the two Corys, but not my family.  Well, you're not a big enough train wreck.  You probably got a more normal, healthy household, with the exception of a Christmas room, but 
[02:51:00]  you're probably a pretty nice family.  Yeah, you got to get a drug addiction or something, and then call A&E again.  Yeah.  But, hey, you know, what...  Oh, he's going to continue.  Jesus.  Hey!  Lay back!  Lay down!  Lay off!  Get laid!  That would have been...  Believe me, there would have been a lot of conflicts.  I know you have nothing to do anymore, but Jesus.  All right, Mick, it's always a pleasure.  Yeah, absolutely, man.  Hey, thanks, guys.  And you have no idea how often I'm, you know, approached by people bearing good news about 
[02:51:30]  O&A and the contributions I made to Anthony's personal life.  Oh, well.  Well.  Well.  Maybe someday you'll hear the news.  How about...  Let's just kind of equate it to you and the WWE.  Oh, no!  Oh, Mick.  That's right.  No.  You know something...  It's funny you're calling today.  You might want to pick up the daily news, my friend. 
[02:52:00]  Anthony was getting his ear whispered in, too.  Stop laying out.  Stop laying out.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, Mick, you know something, things happen, you know how things like that are, and, you  know, it was a nice summer and everything, and what can I say?  She caught Anthony sucking a dick.  Wow, I'm sorry.  That was one of my claims to fame. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it's still a claim to fame.  That's a pretty good one.  Well, sorry about that, buddy.  It's okay.  Everything's fine and dandy.  You'll, you know, I'm sure you'll get all sides of the story.  Sorry.  You hooked him up with a Playboy Playmate.  Yeah.  I'll fucking take a chick who was, like, in an episode, an issue of Penthouse Forum.  Some fucking fat broad from the back page.  Nothing.  Yeah.  I wouldn't worry.  You know, you did a great thing there, Mick. 
[02:53:00]  Well, hey, I appreciate it, and sorry it didn't work out.  I'll see what I can do about, you know, some other social event.  Yeah.  What do you got?  I'm not sure.  Unless it's a junior high school play, I don't want to hear it.  Apparently.  To read the news.  Hey, listen.  Maybe I can come in right after my big debut on TNA.  Hey, we can talk about it.  Yeah.  All right.  That sounded enthusiastic.  No, I was like, and when the hell is that?  When do you debut? 
[02:53:30]  Sometime in the next several weeks.  All right.  That's really pinning it down.  Several.  That isn't even a number.  No.  In the next several weeks.  Could be three.  Could be seven.  Three weeks, maybe.  Now, Mick, we're all over that.  You know that.  Hey, thanks, guys.  We're fucking around, but we wish you nothing but the best, and you're going to be great on TNA.  Huge friend of the show, Mick Foley.  Come on in anytime you want.  Thank you.  And listen, I'm being sincere when I'm just reiterating that I thought I left in pretty  good terms with WWE, and I really do like it. 
[02:54:00]  Why?  No.  Why?  You fucking didn't.  Why'd you do that?  Oh, damn.  Oh, I did not expect that one.  I saw that right arm move.  You are a fucking prick.  Enough.  Enough.  Oh, shit.  Oh, it's fucking Mick Foley.  Enough.  Oh, Sam, he called him with you.  Happy birthday.  I know.  Why didn't you hang up on him?  You didn't get to talk to him, Sam? 
[02:54:30]  He's doing his final words to try to, you know, salvage anything he has with Vince McMahon.  That was a big call.  Happy birthday, Sam.  Now beat us.  Bring that cake shitting bitch in here.  Yeah, we got, uh, we're going to be doing some cake farting after the break.  Get the cake shitter.  Get the cake shitter.  No one's going to shit again, right?  No, don't worry.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You fucking, don't worry about it.  No.  You shit every day, right?  Yeah, but I don't do it in front of my friends.  I've heard you did.  That's because you're not a good friend. 
[02:55:00]  Who told you that?  You're a good friend.  Bob Kelly, Caroline's this weekend.  Cake farting next.  Stay there.  All right, let's start the XM show, finally.  Enough of Sam's stupid birthday.  25.  It's not like he's a 12-year-old and we're wearing hats and pinatas.  I know.  Those are the best.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Like, no one knows who it is.  I've got to announce the name.  You get penis candies in your father, the pinata, to the boy's hair. 
[02:55:30]  What?  What did you say?  It's so creepy.  You get penis candies.  And they what?  They fall out of the pinata into the boy's hair.  And then what do you do with them?  Kiss them out.  Kiss them out?  Ugh.  What?  You're a disgusting man.  What was that?  Can we get to the cakes? 
[02:56:00]  I think we should.  All right.  Sam's birthday.  I saw cakes around.  I'm like, all right, it's for Sam's birthday.  And then I forgot that we set up a cake farting today.  Bedelia!  Bedelia, you bitch!  Where's my cake?  Oh, man.  Entenmann's cake.  You know, you could have really gotten bad cake, but they got cake that I just want to  eat.  And after the farting, I'm not going to be able to resist.  You're lucky that you got Entenmann's, because I figured if there was a girl coming in and 
[02:56:30]  she was going to fart on cake, we'd want something with a little substance to it.  Steve decides to ask Sam yesterday, what's your favorite kind of cake?  And then starts asking me if I have a Carvel near me.  He wanted to get an ice cream cake for this girl to bury her ass in.  It doesn't work that way.  That's because it would hurt her.  Her pussy lips will get freezed.  Do they have a mic out there?  They're laughing pretty good.  You know, I think I took it into mic, the platform.  It makes us look good when the audience laughs that loud.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, hey. 
[02:57:00]  Hey, let's talk to the farter.  So she's going to be farting into some cakes and stuff.  Is that what her name is?  The farter?  The farter.  Get in here.  Oh, that's her?  Oh, careful, dear.  Watch your step.  Watch your step now.  Pat Duffy's in love.  I can see.  Pat Duffy.  Nah, she ain't fat enough.  Mic on?  Not fat enough for Pat Duffy to be in love.  She's sexy, man.  Pat Duffy likes an ample ass, a bunt, or something like that.  I like your little tattoo.  I'm not fat at all.  What's your name?  I'm Amy.  Hi, Amy. 
[02:57:30]  Hi.  What are you going to do today?  I'm going to fart on a cake for you guys.  You can fart on cue.  What are you, Greek?  How do you do that?  No, I've been holding it in.  Do you have to fart now?  Yes.  Really?  Well, don't.  I've been having a fart since I woke up at four this morning.  Wow.  Did you prepare for the farting today?  I ate a lot of White Castles last night.  Oh, that was good.  So you haven't done the bathroom?  Holy shit.  Do you have a dick?  I went to get some, but I didn't fart.  I can hold the fart on.  You're, like, pink like a guy.  Yeah, it's fucking out drinking.  White Castles.  I got a fart.  I've been holding it in. 
[02:58:00]  Shot, kill him.  I'm good.  Scratching my balls.  Wait a minute.  You took a shit, but you can shit without farting?  How the fuck does that happen?  My farts come after my shit, I guess.  I don't fart before I shit.  You have, like, a separate canal for farts?  I don't know.  I mean, it's the same fucking funnel.  I piddled this morning, but I didn't...  You piddled.  Can you say that again?  I piddled.  Can you say that one more time?  I piddled.  A little popcorn piss.  Fuck, I want to fucking punch my wife in the face.  But, Bobby, you were in love.  Fuck her.  She doesn't fart.  You want a farter? 
[02:58:30]  One night when she was in the middle of the night, she was sleep, grinding her teeth, and  then a little...  came out.  I was like, ugh.  I wanted to dump her then, but this chick's...  She's kind of like, I like you.  You're kind of...  What are you, Italian?  I'm Italian-Norwegian.  Norwegian?  Norwegian.  Oh, you don't fuck with black guys, do you?  No.  I can't say much for my sister, but not me.  Oh!  She's a...  The sister's the wild one that wants to hurt daddy.  Yeah.  She smokes Newports?  Yeah, she did for a while.  Of course she did.  Because you always tell a chick dates a black guy when she's puffing on Newport 100s. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, fuck that.  Comes home, starts talking like this and shit.  Oh, well, the town that we live in, I live on Long Island, the town that we live in, everybody  talks out loud.  Mastic?  Brentwood.  Okay, Brentwood.  Brentwood.  She has black lipstick.  Brentwood.  That's a tough town.  Yeah.  She's got a lot of Hispanics in Brentwood.  A lot.  A lot of El Salvadorians.  Oh, that's the worst ones, yeah.  Is it?  Why are they the worst?  Because they're uncliffed.  Because they're always trying to hit on me, and like, they're just nasty.  Hey, mommy. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, it's like, you're telling me you love me in Spanish.  I don't care if you love me.  Go fucking do something else.  I hate that.  Do what?  Like what?  Like, go suck some other chick's dick or something.  I don't know.  Suck a chick's dick?  Yeah.  Jesus, Jimmy, wake up.  I'm right here, Bobby.  Bobby.  But I try not to hang out in my town, so I try to leave as much as possible.  Where do you go, wine dance?  It's a Long Island joke, people.  Wine dance now.  I slip, base jar.  What do you do for a living?  I'm a dog groomer.  A what? 
[03:00:00]  A dog groomer.  I'm a dog groomer.  Really?  Do you have the little thing that does the nails, that little new thing out there?  No, that thing doesn't work.  Do you squeeze their asshole muscles?  The anal glands, yeah.  You squeeze that shit in the ring.  Like that?  You have to.  Really?  Yeah.  That is the most disgusting thing that dog groomers have to do.  What?  Every dog in their assholes has a little anal gland, and it fills up.  And you've got to discreet it.  You ever see a dog scoot?  Yeah.  You ever see a little dog scoot across the desk?  Hell yeah.  The anal glands are filled, and you have to bring them to the vet, and she squeezes the  dog's asshole, so it like pops out, and pfft, and jizz. 
[03:00:30]  It's the worst smelling thing you can ever smell.  Is it really?  Oh, yeah.  You smell his belly button?  I'm sure it smells worse than that.  Really?  Hey, chick in the polka dots, coin city yourself in the way of the girl that wants to see.  That's right.  No offense.  Marissa came in and sang.  She should be able to see.  She texted me and said, tell that cunt with the red hair to get out of the way.  Marissa!  What? 
[03:01:00]  Oh, no.  Marissa!  I don't know.  Do you believe everything he says?  No, it's radio.  It's a bit.  Why would you say that?  I was just being cordial.  Why would you say that?  Nah, it actually happened.  That's very mean.  Do you have panties on?  Of course I did.  Yes.  Of course I did.  She said, tell that Molly Ringwald looking bitch that she ain't made of glass.  All right, so what was the answer to the panty question?  I'm wearing panties.  Do you have g-strings? 
[03:01:30]  I'm wearing boy shorts kind of thing.  Could you make a little g-string out of it and try to blow two candles out?  Split the font in half?  Am I doing with my underwear on?  No, no, no.  Can we see the underwear?  Not to be dirty.  I want to see something.  Not to be dirty.  Wait a minute.  At the back?  Wowie.  Holy sugar.  Seriously, take this ring and stick it in your vagina.  Jesus.  He wants her to take his wedding ring and put it in her vagina?  Why am I losing weight?  From what?  From what? 
[03:02:00]  For the impending divorce.  Yeah.  So, can I see?  I didn't see.  I was caught up with...  I think you're lying.  I swear to God, baby.  I didn't see.  I was caught up with fucking killing my wife.  Oh.  How spankable is that?  Wait, stop for one second.  That's very spankable.  Yeah, that is spankable.  Can you pull them, like make them g-strings a little bit?  That, like that, yeah.  God damn.  Yeah, now can you bend over a little bit?  Touch your toes.  Can you back up around 13 feet?  Do you like to be spanked?  Yes.  You do?  Yes.  Like hard or like soft? 
[03:02:30]  Hard.  Could Jimmy spank you?  No.  Do you want to smack my ass?  Yes.  More than I want to breathe.  Come to him.  Come on.  No, come to him.  Come here.  Did you ever have a dull buck knife put to your throat?  You have to turn this way.  The audience will...  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  A pal talk audience wants to crucify me because I haven't done anything.  Which way do you want me to stand?  You need a little light, Jimmy.  I can't see.  I can't see.  Okay, bend forward.  Bend forward.  All right, now just go.  It hurts.  It hurts. 
[03:03:00]  All right, keep going.  Just keep going.  A couple more maybe.  Keep going.  Let me get this.  I think he's been trying to say too much.  Get on here.  Oh my God.  Wait, did you have a seizure?  I can't explain that.  You guinea brat!  He starts hitting her.  Jimmy's in shock over here.  That's what I expect.  How do you even explain that? 
[03:03:30]  He looks like a retard having gone through a seizure.  There you go.  That's what I was.  He turned into a fucking robot.  Yeah.  Well, let's get some cake farting done, huh?  Can I just ask her a couple more questions?  Sure.  Is that your real hair, Carla?  No.  What color hair do you have?  It's a little lighter than that.  It's a little lighter than that?  Yeah.  Do you use brick?  Where are we going with this?  I guess he's trying to ask me if the drapes match the...  Yeah, yeah.  This is all going down the road.  Is your pussy the same color and do you shave it?  You call your pussy a drape? 
[03:04:00]  I don't know.  What do you guys call it?  Nothing.  No, it's do the drapes match the carpet?  Yeah, we know what she was trying to say.  Nice.  Does the lamp match the fucking stove?  Yeah.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Is that code for fuck you in the ass?  Does the toaster match the crib?  So it's totally shaved?  It's shaved?  It is, but it's about one week grown-in.  We were going to see it anyway.  She's got the bludo going.  Did you get arrested?  I got the one week thing going on.  Oh my God.  That's a week?  What? 
[03:04:30]  That's a week?  Is your hair all the way down?  That's not that bad.  That's not bad.  So you're not that hairy a person, huh?  Yeah.  Why would you shave?  That's the Norwegian definitely fighting that Italian.  Yeah.  Because you're the fucking...  My dad is Norwegian.  He's very, very, very hairy.  I got very lucky not to tell you that.  Really?  The Norwegian is hairy?  I thought the Norwegian wouldn't be hairy and the Italian would be.  I thought this would be Norwegian wood floor.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh.  Boo.  Oh, they're all booing.  Boo.  As they should be.  They're the best crowd ever. 
[03:05:00]  That was a test and you passed.  Oh.  I'm so happy.  I was looking through the crowd and I was like,  who's this girl going to be farting her cat?  I'm so happy at you.  What did you think it was?  I'd like to fart on a cake.  Well, I know Jim looked very excited.  He's like, you're going to be the farter?  No, I saw the video.  I was so excited.  I saw your little movie.  My little movie.  What?  She's got a movie.  What?  Um, well, should I say how this started?  No!  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, me and my friends, my friends have radio shows on the Cringe Humor Network. 
[03:05:30]  And, uh, Hate Speech Radio asked me to fart on a cake for his birthday.  Oh, well, that's no title for a radio show, I hope.  That's their title.  That's Dave and Heather's right there.  How do you put that on a team?  Oh.  They're the radio hosts?  Yeah, they're two of them.  And then we got the BJ radio host back there.  And, uh, great shows.  But, uh, they asked me to fart on the cake.  I did.  It was actually for fun.  It's not a turn-on thing at all.  I just think it's really funny.  It doesn't sound like anything could be a turn-on as far as farting.  Yeah, farting.  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  Someone left a cake in the rain, and what does she do?  Fart son.  Almost shits on her.  Well, I heard I'm not allowed to drop a log, so.  Would you if you were allowed to?  Have you ever?  If it happens, it happens, right?  Yeah.  I mean, who's, what are we going to say?  She's going to make sure she doesn't, but if it happens, it happens.  If a little snickerdoodle falls out and hits the back of your calf, no one's looking.  Just give her a Kevlar shirt just in case a foot comes towards her.  Yeah.  I thought it was a brown bullet. 
[03:06:30]  Resembled a fat, smelly knife.  I got more.  It looked like one nunchuck.  Well, let's do some cake for it.  Could have been an exploding cigar.  I smoked it for a half hour, and it didn't blow up.  You got to go with the dark cake.  You think so?  Yeah.  Because we got three different cakes we could work with.  I say dark cake.  Chocolate on chocolate.  That's what it is.  You go to white. 
[03:07:00]  Oh.  So you can see if any little dust comes out a little faster.  Chocolate on chocolate.  Now, what do you think?  It's so funny when she's done because she's squirt, you know.  Looks like shit.  Yeah, yeah.  What kind of farts are you sporting here?  Do you have continuous one big one, or is it a few of them?  I'm going to try to get a couple little ones out.  Like, I've been holding it an old eye.  You have good asshole technique where you can kind of squeeze one out, but then...  You know what?  Farts are just farts.  I'm used to just walking around.  I got to fart, right?  Yeah?  Squeeze one out.  But then when you put on the spot, it's like, all right, you got to hold it for this 
[03:07:30]  particular moment.  So I'm really hoping that I get...  How long have you been without a boyfriend?  I'm just going to fart.  And my ex-boyfriend thinks that what I'm doing is disgusting.  Really?  Fucking queer.  Well, fuck him.  I don't even give a fuck.  Fuck him.  Oh, who would?  What a douchebag he is.  Do you have a fart during sex?  No, not with him, but...  No?  Hardcore sex is awesome.  When someone's going down on you, you just... 
[03:08:00]  I love you.  No.  Hold on.  Lisa's walking through.  Oh, thank you.  Go ahead, Lisa.  It's all about you.  I love that she answers questions I didn't even ask.  Do you have a fart during sex?  No, but I love hardcore sex.  I love hardcore.  I like taking it in the ass with a shovel.  Oh, no.  No, not a shovel, right?  Do you prefer the...  Do you prefer slow?  Like, do you prefer the...  The deep hard fuck?  Or do you...  It depends, but yeah. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  Do you like it?  Do you ever take it in the rump?  I took it a couple times, but I really don't like it.  Me neither.  I don't either.  Pulled it out and had a little Lincoln hat on it?  I don't know.  Jesus.  I like just like a knuckle rubbed around my asshole.  What?  That's kind of gay.  Up to the wristwatch.  Yeah.  That's kind of gay.  Like, just a knuckle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, you never ate a guy's ass?  You never licked a guy's ass?  No, because I don't know any gay guys like that.  That's hardcore.  You don't like a gay...  You don't like a nice ass licking on a guy? 
[03:09:00]  Oh, I'll take an ass licking on me, but I won't do one on a guy.  He threw a guy's legs over his head like a fat baby and just munched his pussy out?  Oh, fuck.  Jesus.  Bobby.  Just asking.  Bobby.  Just asking.  We'll do a little Q&A, that's all.  Yeah.  Trying to get to know the girl.  Wow.  I think she's smoking.  I'm so happy at you.  Thank you.  I'm praying the fart smells.  Are you really praying it stinks like fucking really bad?  I'm so praying the fart smells.  That would be great.  I'm hoping for you guys.  I will laugh my ass off.  All right, let's get the chocolate cake down. 
[03:09:30]  Okay, do we want any...  Let's mic the audience, too, if we can.  Anything else on it?  Because we got some extra goodies to put on the cake.  Like more frosting or some pudding.  I've never seen this before, so I don't know.  I guess we could try dry, and then we could always add.  All right, let's do that.  Are you going to light a candle?  Is she going to blow out the candle with the fart?  No.  Fine.  All right, the cake is on the strip of coal or on the strip of coal.  She'll light the cake on it, or are you just leaving it? 
[03:10:00]  No, well, for now, we'll add more later.  Well, you tell us.  Later.  What do you want?  You want three?  How many cake farts are we doing?  As many as you can muster.  All right, Jimmy, you want to be the man on the scene there?  All right, I'll...  I do this to Jimmy every time.  Thank you, shittiest beard I've ever seen.  It's a chin strap.  He's just a mess.  He's got a chin strap beard.  All right, so what are you going to do for us today? 
[03:10:30]  I'm going to fart on the cake.  I guess I got to disrobe, right?  Yeah, you might want to.  Where can I go?  I don't want to be in the Paltor camera's way.  Well, if you stand exactly where dumb fuck is standing, you'll be in the way.  Pop.  Oh.  19 people just moved.  Jimmy, slide around a little bit so I can help you out a little bit.  Okay.  So I can see.  Well, move back.  Move...  She's got a beat.  Look at the stomach, too.  She's solid.  Look at that.  Thank you.  She'd take your top off when you do this.  Yeah.  Well, you don't need your underpants. 
[03:11:00]  You don't want to fart.  Yeah, I know.  You guys ready?  Yeah, we are.  You might want to take them off.  What about the top, though?  Holy mackerel.  She's removing her underpants.  She's naked.  Her vagina, it sits between both legs.  I hope so.  And it's got a little stubble on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's pretty.  Which way do you guys want me to face?  The audience or you guys?  Yeah, we want the audience to enjoy the game.  Well, you can kind of face both ways.  Maybe you could put squat facing Duffy with kind of... 
[03:11:30]  How do I say this tactfully?  With your cunt and asshole.  Now, maybe you could just kind of face them a little bit.  Oh, the one girl's blocking her boyfriend's...  Madam, why are you blocking your husband or boyfriend's eyes?  He's got glasses.  He probably can't see that well anyway.  Hold on.  She's getting ready for the cake part.  Turn a little of this off.  We can't see anything, madam.  Hold on, hold on.  What are we, mashed potatoes?  Please hold.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I got a great view here.  I was in a room with six people. 
[03:12:00]  Now, I got a whole fucking audience.  Yeah, and plus, you know, God knows how many...  I mean, a million or so listening.  Yeah, right?  Oh, my God.  Sorry, I hope your piney doesn't fucking panic.  That's a point.  Yeah.  How's the cake?  I hope my dad didn't listen today.  Oh, I hope he did.  Don't worry about it.  Wait a second.  We can't see.  He's already concerned with your sister.  We still can't see.  Yeah, you're only farting on cakes.  Yeah.  You're not going to marry one.  All right, unless you guys...  She's sitting...  Hold on.  I didn't know she was going to sit on it.  I'm trying to get out my high.  I was holding all fucking day.  You got to hold yourself.  You just warn us when it's coming, because we're going to chit-chat and all that stuff. 
[03:12:30]  Her hiney is in the cake.  Yes.  Let us know when we need it.  What a great gift.  Yeah, fucking crap.  I hope you don't mind if I move my legs.  That's right.  There's no need for language like that.  She's rubbing her wrong...  My ears are not garbage cans.  Don't worry.  I'm holding all fucking day.  Oh, no.  Bend over a little.  No, half of it is the reverberation doesn't work.  The what?  You need reverberation, otherwise you won't hear it.  Yeah, you have to, right?  You give us a little warning?  I have such a fucking cramp.  What's the matter?  I'll massage it.  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  I've been having such a fucking cramp all week.  Jesus.  There we go.  Oh, it's good.  There's rubbing the cramp down, right?  That's right.  That's good right there, right?  Is your clitoris cramped?  No.  Bobby's rubbing out the cramp.  Oh, my God.  You're really...  You're fucking...  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  I've been all week.  I think your fart is in your cast.  Oh.  Fucking Bobby.  God.  What the fuck happened?  You're Steve running in to not stop anything. 
[03:13:30]  I'm just kidding.  I didn't know.  Is that better?  Do you feel better?  You wouldn't have...  Let me know if you get a...  Bail out.  Bail out.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Stay right there.  It's really bad.  Let me know if you get a cramp in your pussy.  All right.  How's the cramp?  I think he's making it worse.  Of course he is.  That's what Bobby does.  Yeah.  It's pretty...  It's actually...  You really get a fucking knot right there.  Yeah, I do.  All right.  Stop kicking my nuts.  I'm not kicking your nuts.  Why would? 
[03:14:00]  Bob is giving the worst cat massage.  No, I'm giving you a good one.  Oh, it's just awful.  She said it's bad.  You're making her cramps worse.  You're making it worse.  I'm not a fucking Asian lady.  I'm just trying to help out.  I know.  All right.  Stay right there.  Do that right there.  Or a doctor fucking Kelly.  I know.  He just wants to stare at my throat.  Stop cock-locking, Tony.  Of course he does.  I want to stare at your twat.  I'm not staring at anything.  How am I cock-locking?  I'm back here, and you're fucking massaging her thigh.  Exactly.  She's got cake in her asshole, Bob.  All right. 
[03:14:30]  Good point.  Sorry, guys.  I'm just a little nervous right now.  Why are you nervous?  I haven't been this close to another pussy.  I know.  Why is he nervous?  She's being brought by Colonel Kurtz.  All right.  She's going to try to get it.  All right.  She's back in there.  All right.  She's back in the cake.  Her ass is in the cake.  Come on, people.  I need a fart.  Let's speak.  You'll get one.  You can do it.  I was holding it all day, people.  Come on.  You can do it.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  You're doing good.  It's not your stomach.  I'm trying to.  If a log comes out, it's okay.  Just push.  Push like you're giving birth. 
[03:15:00]  Could someone hand me my Coca-Cola that's behind the lease?  Oh, yeah.  The Coke will do it.  I just rinked that entire orange juice.  It's still gassy.  Now push this.  That's okay.  Have some Coke.  You'll get it.  Atta girl.  Make it stinker.  She's chugging down on the phone.  Jesus.  This is a fucking immature show.  I think I got one.  Okay.  Here we go.  Hush, y'all.  Everyone quiet. 
[03:15:30]  I might pee.  It's fine.  Now, come on, people.  So close.  I feel you.  Oh, please.  All this pressure.  Everybody's staring at me.  Nobody's talking.  Now, you'll be fine.  No, no, no.  Just do it.  Sorry.  Jimmy, are you going to go in for a sniff right after?  I'll probably get it from here.  I don't want the cake to spoil it.  Oh, my God.  Why won't it come out?  You're doing good.  You're doing good.  Just keep focusing.  I think it's not coming out because you're not topless. 
[03:16:00]  That's true.  You're being constrained by that broth.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  Perhaps if your titties were exposed.  Don't burp.  Swallow that air.  Take your high heels off, too.  They're probably digging into you.  Yeah.  Maybe Poe kicks her in the stomach.  Here it comes.  All right.  Shh.  This is so fucking annoying.  I had nothing to do but fart all day on the train.  I'm like, God, I got to go. 
[03:16:30]  It'll come.  I got to go.  Don't worry.  Don't hurt.  So much pressure.  And then you sitting right there.  Come on.  It's all right.  Why?  Make it stinker.  Make it stinker.  You got to make it stinky.  Stinker.  It's okay.  Oh, my God.  Everything's fine.  Come on, fart.  Do it.  Hurry up.  Too much pressure.  Nah, you'll be fine.  Who cares?  You're letting everybody down horribly.  I, yeah, you're telling me. 
[03:17:00]  No, no, it's fine.  You're fucking telling me.  No, who cares?  Our whole Friday show is built around this,  and here you are with your twat and a cake,  just doing nothing.  That's all about you.  No, no, go right ahead.  Ruin it.  I'm just kidding.  You're such a jerk.  I'm going to make sure I shove this face,  this cake right in your face when I'm done.  He will love it.  Yeah, I know.  How are you going to shove it when I'm nose diving into it?  I'll be swan diving.  What are you?  You know, she's going to get mad  and throw hundreds of dollars at him?  All right, well, what are you going to do?  Why, Bob?  You have to fucking spoil our fun.  Just trying to stall for the fart. 
[03:17:30]  I'm going to push your stomach.  Do that Tai Chi shit.  I'm trying to push my stomach.  Yeah, where are we at?  Luke, you want to push my stomach?  You're doing great.  I'm working out a little smelly, disgusting baby.  Oh, my God.  I ate so much White Castle still.  Oh, look at that sound.  It's just fucking crazy.  I haven't waited for shit this long  since E-Rock was late for work.  Where is that motherfucker?  High five, brother.  By the way, would you be open 
[03:18:00]  to being on a webcam in a house?  Yes.  Who's house?  She's always on the counter  farting into the crumb cake.  Farting into all the food.  Are you farting?  No, okay, I'll eat it.  She lifts the saran wrap and gas  and it looks like Giphy Popcorn.  She farts at the liverwurst.  My coffee's cold.  Will you fart me?  I should just have someone  blow air into my ass.  What?  You should have said that  before the cake was there. 
[03:18:30]  Pat Duffy, would you blow some?  All right.  Do we do it with a straw  or are you going to go  just mouth to mouth?  Like a life raft.  I don't like the way  you dole out the assignments.  I get to watch,  but when it comes to the air  being blown in the ass,  Duff.  Jimmy, would you like  to do the air belong?  No, Duffy should do it, I think.  Duffy's not paid.  Duffy, are you going to do it  with a straw  or are you going to go  mouth to mouth?  I'll leave it up to her.  Do you want me to use a straw?  Or do you want me to use...  I use a straw.  What the fuck?  Are you guys crazy?  The end of a straw  is a little sharp. 
[03:19:00]  I remember hurting myself once  while I was being fenced.  Does that help you fart  mouth to mouth to your ass?  If you blow wind into your ass...  Air comes in, air comes out, Dara.  At least you guys  won't have to wait that much longer.  She's right.  Just blow it in  and I'll fart it out.  All right, let's go.  Yeah, let's...  And I think with the straw  it just looks funnier, though.  Motherfucker.  That's amazing.  That's all right.  But don't start sucking out,  you little devil.  Yeah.  Send it over.  You want to put this  in your own ass?  Yeah, let her put the straw  in her own ass. 
[03:19:30]  No, no, just for safety.  Now, Kat, she touched you.  Pat will fucking  croquet mallet it in.  Kat's going to suck  instead of blow.  Pat will use his shoe  to calm down  and get your asshole.  Oh, God.  He's in the way.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Not yet.  Hold on.  Someone has to mic the girl  because the straw going in  could be...  You want me to hold the...  I'll hold the mic.  All right, tell us what she's...  He's micing my ass.  All right, tell us  what he's doing there.  He's sticking the straw  up my ass.  All right.  Ow!  Don't twist it. 
[03:20:00]  Dude!  Just blow now.  Just blow in there.  All right, and now  Pat's blowing.  Ow!  Oh, he's stuck!  All right, hold on, hold on.  Ready?  Wait, no, not yet.  Hold on.  Please, hurry.  That hurt.  Um, ready?  Yes.  Oh, more.  All right, wait.  That was going on.  All right, we need more air.  We need more air.  Wait, wait, I got more.  I heat blew so much air 
[03:20:30]  into my ass.  Thanks.  I need a little  reverberation.  All right, shake it around.  It kind of sounds like a queef.  cake party.  I think that's all of it.  All right, hold on.  I'll say one more.  One more, yeah.  Does it smell?  Oh, Danny!  Danny doesn't smell.  I can't smell anything, man.  All right.  I think it smells.  All right, Pat.  Let's draw back in the ass.  Don't do it as deep. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, come on, Pat.  All right, hold on.  Her eyelids fluttered.  She fucking blew  on her kidneys.  And don't blow it up  like it's fucking hell.  All right, he's blowing air  back into the butt.  Slow.  Slow.  She'll tell you why.  Ow!  It's a tire of a semi.  All right, shh, shh.  Poof.  I think I gotta poop, though, now.  Good.  Right?  Right through the straw.  Oh.  Uh, yeah, no.  Don't poop.  Yeah, I'm gonna poop.  No, you're not.  All right.  Okay, right on the cake. 
[03:21:30]  Don't poop.  No, I'm good.  I have no more air coming out.  Yeah, don't poop.  What, is it a solid log  or is it a big fucking mess?  I think it's a solid log.  A big white castle mess.  Let's up, we put the straw in there  and suck it out like a fribble.  Oh, no.  Duffy, Duffy.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  I have to protest.  I must stop this atrocity.  No duty in the studio.  We'll all be doomed.  Yes.  So how does my ass smell?  You just sniffed the straw.  Smells like asshole and chocolate cake. 
[03:22:00]  Oh.  Yes.  All right.  A lovely combination.  You rocking chocolate cake?  Duffy, are you in love there or what?  I'm in love with her,  but I like the other girl a little better.  Which one?  Well, gee, I wonder why.  The redheaded girl.  But that's her boyfriend right next to her.  Yeah, right.  What are you doing, you silly?  Rubbing her thigh.  Never stopped me before.  What's that tattoo you have on the breast?  She's really sexy.  It's a comedy mask and a microphone.  Okay.  Do you do stand-up or just the radio?  I do stand-up and radio.  That's cool.  Do you want to do stand-up for us today? 
[03:22:30]  Maybe.  Why not?  Yes, sir.  What's your name?  Let's do it.  Heather Height.  Heather?  Height.  Height.  H-E-I-G-H-T?  Yep-er.  Cool.  Why don't we have her do stand-up for the crowd?  Okay.  Let's go.  Are we doing a little disappointed?  The farts didn't smell.  I gotta go wash up, weird.  Oh.  Yeah, go wash up.  Well, you gotta put some pants on or else Paul will kick you in the chest.  Yeah, someone's gotta eat the cake, by the way.  Yeah, stick your...  No, Joe, there could be germs in it.  I wanna see you guys eat the cake.  Don't eat that cake.  Yes, it could have cholesterol.  I must stop everyone from hurting themselves. 
[03:23:00]  Be careful, Jim.  The ice might tinkle off your teeth and break them.  I'm the catcher in the rye.  A little reference that maybe readers know.  I'm the catcher in my personal life, too.  Catcher for the guy.  I love the little cake frosting.  It looks like a log.  That was great.  Yeah, it just kind of... 
[03:23:30]  That blowing...  Nice.  That was good.  The straw in the ass with Pat Duffy blowing air into the ass.  Amy's my hero.  Honestly, God.  That's improvising.  Heather Height.  Heather, you were the one that pretty much introduced us to cake farting.  Yes.  And that's awesome.  And what's the name of your show again?  It's Hate Speech Radio.  Hate Speech Radio.  How do we get there?  On CringHumorRadio.com.  All right, very good.  Oh, Jimmy's now...  There's no cake.  Nah, man.  I do a little cheat.  There is no cake.  You play Portal.  It's a little Portal joke for people.  I like that.  Great game. 
[03:24:00]  I didn't get it.  Can we clean that fucking load of frosting up?  Yeah.  What's wrong?  It's sitting there looking like a scarf on Diaclossi's.  What?  What?  What?  What?  No one knows what you mean.  I know.  It's like, shut up.  You want to do stand-up for the crowd?  Oh, I guess so.  That's a little weird, but all right.  I'll do something.  I don't care.  Behind glass, it's like a fucking prison comedy.  It's like an experiment.  Who are you doing comedy for, Hannibal Lecter? 
[03:24:30]  Go.  No, I'll be like the man in black, right?  Someone should bring her up.  Do they want to bring you up?  Yeah, Bobby, you bring her up.  I'm already here.  Go ahead.  Yeah, make it like a show or something.  All right, cool.  All right.  I'll come over there and do it.  What's your name again?  You got an intro.  Heather Height.  You got to give her the intro.  Bob Waite introducing Heather Height.  It's not as fun when you can't hear through the headphones.  Trust me, it's funny.  Do you have like a TV credit?  You want to make something up? 
[03:25:00]  Yes.  What have you been on TV?  Sell the kids.  I'm never coming back.  What would you do?  Sell the house, sell the wife, sell the kids.  Tonight Show?  All right, cool.  Whatever.  Heather Height.  All right.  You guys, hey, how you guys doing tonight?  Hey, sir, how you doing?  Good to see you.  Hey, what's up, cutie?  Look at this little fucking young buck.  I just fucked his mouth.  Welcome to the show.  All right.  Are we our first comedian?  Are you guys ready for you?  Bobby, why does he got to like warm up the crowd a little?  I did.  I just warmed him up.  That was the lack of luster.  Hey, people.  I'm with my wife, Bonnie, this weekend in Biloxi, Mississippi. 
[03:25:30]  23 years without a drug or drink in my body.  The baby's going to be opening for us.  Bonnie's middling.  I'm headlining.  I'm going to be sitting on a piano going, where are you from?  Fuck Mike Bibiglia.  All right, you ready?  You guys ready for your first start?  You guys ready for some comedy tonight?  Yeah.  Woo.  Yes.  This is the woman you came to see.  You've seen her on absolutely fucking nothing. 
[03:26:00]  She has no credit to what to speak of, but she's on hate radio.  Her name is hate fucking whatever.  Hate speech.  Radio.  Thanks.  Next.  Her name is Heather Height, everybody.  Heather Height.  Give it up for Heather Height.  You got a red light, the MC.  Thank you very much.  What's your name again, sir?  Oh, beat it, host.  This is so awkward.  This is wonderful.  I love awkward situations, so it's okay.  So I'm a single mother of four, and I have no fucking idea what I'm doing. 
[03:26:30]  I think that you need like a whole different parenting technique.  When you have four, my one friend has one kid, and she drives the little fucker to school  every day because he won't get up in time to catch the bus.  That would never happen in our home because they would be too afraid I would set them on fire.  I find that children are much more well-behaved when worried about their own lives.  It brings them closer together, you know.  I hear them in their room in the morning bonding. 
[03:27:00]  Get up.  She's crazy.  It's all my mom's fault.  My mother has the parenting techniques of a sociopath.  While other moms were like teaching their daughters how to like cook and stuff,  she was teaching me how many bodies fit in the trunk of a 78 Buick.  And my father taught me how to drive when I was 13.  I know that that's young, but he needed a ride home from the bar,  and we were going the same way.  So it's like, what the hell? 
[03:27:30]  So now my 16-year-old wants to learn how to drive, and I don't know.  I guess I'll have to start drinking again.  So, one more?  I'll do one more.  Yeah, what are you doing?  A three-minute spot?  I don't know.  You guys didn't give me a time.  So my dad used to think it was a...  You're headlining.  You're doing 45.  Yeah.  My dad used to think it was putting a prank phone call on me.  He'd call me up and like breathe heavy, and I'd be like, oh, hi, Dad.  You know, because he did it all the time.  And he's like, how do you know it's me? 
[03:28:00]  I'm like, because you're the only fucking one that does it.  Except for like this one time, somebody called me up and breathed heavy into the phone.  And I was like, hi, Dad.  And there was like silence.  And then he hung up.  And I'm picturing him like going to all this prank phone call meeting buddies, you know.  Like, she totally fucked with me.  She said, hi, Dad.  She's crazy.  That's all I got.  Well, no, I would...  The last one...  The last one needs to be tightened up a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  The last one she's tightened up. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  And I would change when the kids joke, all in personal opinion, about fire.  I like the fire.  Thanks.  Instead of saying worry about their own lives, put in skin grafts.  Oh, nice.  It ties in with fire and it's more specific.  Yeah.  And it's a more vile image.  That is...  A child with skin grafts.  That's awesome.  No eyelids.  Yeah.  That stupid look on their face.  Big dumb hat that never fits quite right.  That shitty wig.  Let's hear it for Heather Hyatt.  That's a tough spot right there.  Thanks for getting well. 
[03:29:00]  Thank you.  You did very well.  Heather Hyatt, everybody.  Give it up.  Hate Speech Radio, right?  Hate Speech Radio on Cringe Humor Radio, 8 o'clock on Sunday nights.  Nice.  You want a piece of cake?  Anybody...  This is not the farted on cake, but a piece of...  We got some motherfucking marshmallow iced.  Oh, marshmallow iced.  Why didn't you use that?  I want a sliver of this bitch.  She looks good for four kids, too.  Four kids.  I know.  Single mom.  Same dad for all four.  I was married twice.  I was married twice.  Bobby?  Jesus.  Well, my mother had a couple kids.  She looks like shit. 
[03:29:30]  But you said it looks good for having four kids.  Well, I look good for having no kids.  Four kids.  Yeah, that's what she wants to hear.  Four kids.  Well, let's not get carried away.  Four kids.  No, no, no.  Jesus.  You're hot is one of them.  Let's talk carry away.  Thank you.  For a mom.  I mean, you don't look like a mom.  You're four of them.  Trying to give you a compliment.  I know.  That was lovely.  That was trying to give a compliment?  It wasn't great.  Holy shit.  It just came out wrong.  What are you going to do?  Oswald was trying to give him a haircut.  Hey, what was the portal joke?  Because everyone said it was brilliant and I didn't get it. 
[03:30:00]  And I need...  You got to play the game.  I want to be part of the club.  You got to play the game because it doesn't make any sense whatsoever unless you play the  game and know that if you get through all the levels, that you're promised cake.  But there is no cake.  What?  Wow.  Yeah, you got to play the game.  They said it was brilliant and hilarious.  Thank you.  To anybody that played the game.  Anyone else, it was the dumbest thing that no one understands.  Great game.  Portal.  Love it.  Portal. 
[03:30:30]  Spores comes out today.  Today or next week?  Who hated it, Portal?  You?  Oh, you're thinking man's game.  Sorry.  Thank you.  Sorry, Dane can't go around with a knife with you and stab people.  Oh, did you get mad because he got stabbed?  Yes, I got mad every time that motherfucker stabbed me.  We're playing a fucking game.  He'd run off.  Because you hit in the same bush every fucking day.  I got a machine gun.  I shoot him with fucking machine gun.  He could still come toward me and fucking stab me and run away laughing.  Heather is still standing there awkwardly.  I know.  I'd like to...  Oh, sorry.  She would really like to leave the room. 
[03:31:00]  No, I'll hang out.  I don't care.  Talking to Call of Duty 4.  Yeah.  Speaking of duty, how's that girl cleaning up over there?  Everything's fine?  You're good?  You know, Entenmann's frosting we found doesn't really stick.  We heated it up in the microwave before she started it.  Yeah.  So that it like kind of, you know...  Did you take a shit?  You took a dump?  You feel better, Amy?  It was a big fat one?  Cigar shaped with windows?  Did it look like a half a thumb?  Like little rabbit turds?  Did it hover and then fly off quickly?  Oh, was it a bunch of milk duds? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, for the most part.  It had bubbles in it?  Well, he blew so much air up there that I guess it just shifted everything around.  I was just like, hey, we're leaving now.  Did it sound like you were dropping change in the toilet?  I would say, yeah, it kind of sounded like that.  So who's eating it?  We don't know.  We would like to see some people eat it.  Well, on our show, my boyfriend, the birthday boy, licked the frosting off her ass after she  was done.  You're a good girlfriend.  I'm an awesome girlfriend.  She is.  Is he good to your four kids? 
[03:32:00]  What?  Is he good to your four kids, this guy?  He's a great guy, yes.  Why?  He's not your kids.  Is he going to be magic number three?  Jesus Christ, were you crazy?  No, apparently I have two children every time I get married.  Is that it?  We're not doing that.  Who wants a piece of cake?  No, I'd totally marry him.  I had one child after my divorce.  It was sort of the cause of the divorce.  See, that's a joke about fucking young girls. 
[03:32:30]  Uncle Paul found it funny.  Yeah, we know who we is.  You did a good job.  Fucking Danny.  Yeah, that's just true.  Thank you.  Danny steps up.  Jesus.  All right, girls.  Thank you.  Yeah, ladies.  Wow.  Thank you so much.  And Jim, thank you for your tips.  I really appreciate that.  Oh, you're welcome.  I'm totally honored.  Oh, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Don't appreciate him. 
[03:33:00]  He didn't mean it.  Good job.  You got balls for getting up and doing that.  Thanks.  Then another compliment, calling her a guy.  Yeah, absolutely.  God.  Air up the pussy.  That's a first.  You guys are breaking the glass ceiling, let me tell you that.  She looks up.  Wait a minute.  I didn't see a glass ceiling.  I thought it was tile.  I heard it really blonde under this red nose.  I was coming from a guy who broke a concrete floor.  Come on, Bobby.  Come on, Bobby.  That's funny.  I don't know where the boy is, I think. 
[03:33:30]  All right, there they go.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, that's awkward.  Oh, and he does that.  Oh, see, girls.  That's okay.  He'll walk it back toward us.  See, he does that, but then there's no payoff.  He just says it.  Yeah, I just kind of look at my Scrabble game.  Hey, is it true this guy's going to propose to you on our show today?  I heard rumors.  Is that what?  Oh, my God.  Oh, a special moment.  Come on, do it now, dude.  What?  Here's your moment.  This is what you asked for.  You did tell us that. 
[03:34:00]  Apparently not.  No, he's shy.  He's not shy.  He's my co-host.  Are you kidding?  I'm not shy at all.  No.  Whoa.  We got a laugher.  All right.  That laugh has to go.  The go has to go.  Here he comes.  Howdy, gents.  Hi.  How y'all doing today?  Sir.  Very well.  What's going on?  How you doing?  You can hold that yourself, probably.  I can.  All right.  I'm a professional, kind of. 
[03:34:30]  Hold the microphone.  So that I'll get paid or have any talent or?  Jimmy's just awkward.  I'm missing an email.  Bobby, you got anything on this guy?  What?  I'm sorry.  I was just staring at her.  I know, right?  Her bum imprint in that cake is fucking awesome.  It is like the perfectly shaped bum print, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You make a good ass print.  Thank you.  Did your cooter get in there?  Yes.  Good girl.  It looks like it's about right here. 
[03:35:00]  Able to perfectly identify where her pussy touched the cake.  It's fantastic.  Depending on the time of the month, it's cherry topped.  Pussy's like finding Bigfoot.  I think Pat Duffy could lick the pussy print off the cake.  I mean, Duffy.  Ah, here comes Duffy.  Hey, Duffy.  He didn't even hesitate.  Wait, bring it to the table.  Where do you see the...  Show him where the pussy part...  Oh, wait.  I think that's right there.  Are there any little tubes in there and little hairs?  No.  No. 
[03:35:30]  There were micro hairs coming out of her.  You're right.  I want to CSI this.  It's David Caruso, this.  Okay, so this is your vagina.  It's like a plaster cast of Bigfoot.  Is that your vagina?  That's what I said.  Yes.  Ten minutes ago.  Fuck, I didn't even listen.  Yeah, thanks.  I'll listen on the replay.  It's always great when you do someone else's joke.  No one laughed when I said it either.  And no one laughed.  What the fuck?  You get a different show when you listen to this back, man.  What is this right here?  It's like Bigfoot.  Yeah.  That is a labia print. 
[03:36:00]  Yes.  Wow.  Labia print.  Labia majora print.  I really squished that cake in there.  Hey, Pat, how's your groin?  We haven't talked to you since you got kicked pretty good.  Yeah, I've seen that.  It's feeling all right.  I felt like I had a stomachache the whole rest of the weekend, but I enjoyed it.  She did some more torture later that night.  What other torture?  Just like when we were pulling on it.  I really liked that.  She was doing that a lot.  And then when I had a boner, she was just squeezing it as hard as she could.  I know.  She was really squeezing it as hard as she could.  It was good. 
[03:36:30]  It was really good.  Do you want her to do anything to you?  No.  I had a feeling it was going in that direction.  Why?  She's a tough girl.  She's sinewy.  Did you ever have somebody grab your beard and your nuts at the same time and pull them?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  I'd like to.  Can she do that right now?  All right.  Did you mind doing that?  What am I doing?  You're a little dominatrix.  You pull his beard and you grab his balls and you pull them at the same time.  And you go, you've been a bad boy, you Amish faggot.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  All right. 
[03:37:00]  Is Russia Broad going to get mad, though?  I think she is, yeah.  Oh, really?  So that could make for a good Friday night, in your case.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  She hits you over the head with a mallet.  Fucking bash your cockhead with a trophy.  I have to win one first.  Wait.  I didn't know you guys were an item officially.  You were Russian Broad.  Sure.  Yeah, I guess so.  All right.  Good.  Good for you, Pat.  Thank you.  She'll fucking kill him, I guess.  I hope so.  I'm sure you'll fuck that one up, too.  I know I will.  Good luck to you.  I know I will.  All right. 
[03:37:30]  Now, hurry up and cheat on it.  Yeah.  God damn.  All right, go ahead.  All right, he's pulling his...  All right, he's pulling his...  You grab...  You thought you were going to have, like, boxers?  Is there something funny?  Pat Duffy doesn't have pants on, and fart girl...  Duffy.  Cake fart girl started laughing.  Yes, Bob?  That's not what you want.  I didn't think he was going to go.  I thought it was going to be boxers.  Oh, hello, mic in my face.  There's kids out there.  Are you ready?  It's cold radio.  Did you move a bit to your right?  Where are you from?  Vermont?  Yeah, the camera... 
[03:38:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, a bit to the right.  What's the Vermont show?  You're moving forward and backwards.  Oh, there you go.  I like Vermont.  He's got a big, huge cock.  Perfect.  Thank you.  He's got a big Vermont dick.  That's all I'm saying.  I like Vermont.  Listen.  All right, this is what you do.  Focus on me for a second, not on his fucking enormously huge, soft mule.  What kind of a fucking prison are you looking through?  Really?  Yeah, really.  Oh, never mind.  It's not even passing his ball sack.  It's shrinking. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, but it's shrinking right now.  It was big when he first pulled it out.  Listen.  You're going to grab...  I want you to grab...  You're going to grab around the balls and the dick like a cock ring.  Bobby, show her.  Okay.  Show her how it's done.  Show her with your mouth.  I grabbed your dick yesterday.  I like that his dick and balls are all one color.  There's no fucking hue whatsoever.  And they're rubbing up against the fucking cord for the headphones.  I like that, though.  It's like his dick is invisible.  Oh, come on.  It's not that bad.  Listen to me.  You want to grab his bush fat, right?  Okay.  Around his bush fat, like a cock ring in his dick and balls. 
[03:39:00]  Grab it and pull it out, and then you grab his beard like this.  Okay.  And then you pull both.  All right.  And you call him a little Amish faggot.  Can I call him a little Amish cunt?  Whatever you want, baby.  Okay.  Make up your own dialogue.  Do your thing.  You improvise.  You know what?  You can do that and then fart while you're doing it if you want.  If I have it in it.  Make it your own, sweetie.  That's all I'm saying.  Do your thing.  Let's do it.  You ready, boys?  Yeah.  Can I grab it nice and tight?  Wait, no.  Tighter.  Tighter.  Tighter.  Fucking.  Fucking.  You cannot fucking hurt me. 
[03:39:30]  Holy shit.  This is not going to happen.  Duffy's an animal.  What is that about?  Because she's trying to hurt you.  You're not going to hurt me.  That's what he told me to do.  No, no.  You did fine.  That's part of it.  That's what he wanted me to do.  No, don't get it.  You made her nervous.  Duffy relax.  Wait, you don't want her to hurt you?  I know.  I do.  She's not going to.  You're going to pull his back.  She's trying to scream.  Look at me.  Basically, he was daring you to do it harder because he was saying, you can't fucking hurt  me, meaning this is nothing.  You're into that shit.  All right.  She's nervous.  Let's try it again.  You sure you didn't date black eyes?  No.  All right.  Listen to Bobby. 
[03:40:00]  Bobby, walk him through it again.  All right.  Listen.  Here we go.  He's going to get mad.  He's not going to hit you, honey, like your last boyfriend.  Okay?  Oh.  No.  They never hit me.  I hit them.  I know.  It was a joke.  Relax.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  Take 10.  Nothing.  I don't know, dude.  I'm just staring at Duffy's cock.  All right.  Cool.  Don't pull into it.  Get a grip first.  Okay.  Pinch it like a ring.  Okay.  You know you're on like a pussy, Duffy.  All right.  We're going to hear her call you an Amish.  Can I punch you in the cunt?  Of course not. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, shit.  Back to your internet radio show.  Listen.  Oh, damn.  Holy shit, Duffy.  What did she say to Duffy?  I called him a pussy because he screamed like a little girl when she pulled on him.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  So I totally deserved it.  Whatever.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  You ready?  All right.  He's not.  Listen to me.  Focus.  He's not going to hit you no matter what you do.  Okay.  Well, I hit back.  He might yell and scream, but that's part of it.  That's what this fucking creep likes.  And he may have milk come out of his wee-wee.  Yeah. 
[03:41:00]  It's okay.  And when he says, you can't fucking hurt me, then you got to yell more things at him.  Yeah.  You really got to get into this here.  Okay.  But you got to simultaneously grab his beard and his fucking cock, and then you pull together.  Don't grab and pull and rip.  Like one fucking-  One motion.  Fluid motion.  Okay.  All right.  Ready?  Let's go.  All right.  Ready?  Grab the dick.  Wait.  You got a shirt.  Fix the shirt.  No shirt.  Like that?  Yeah.  Grab that.  Now grab the beard.  No, grab it with your fucking finger.  Like that. 
[03:41:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Now look at him in the fucking face like a little maggot that he is.  You fucking Amish fuck.  You're a fucking Amish fag.  That's what you are.  You're a fag.  You like that, don't you?  I don't want to literally murder your whole family.  I bet you do.  I bet you do.  Oh, God.  Come on.  You're not even pulling hard, you fucking cunt.  Do it again.  Slap me.  Slap me.  Do it harder.  Harder, you fucking bitch.  Harder.  Harder.  You have nothing on me.  You are not going to hurt me. 
[03:42:00]  You're not going to.  I don't fucking get hurt.  Grab his dick.  Grab it.  Pull it.  Holy shit.  You're a fucking fag.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  Get him down on his knees.  Get on your knees.  Get him down.  There you go.  Now say good pill.  That was adorable.  Wow.  Wipe him on the cake. 
[03:42:30]  I'm getting reports.  Steve is right by the door getting very nervous.  Somebody else.  Yes.  Stop.  She yells fag.  He thought it was fag.  Yes.  Hello.  Now, why did she keep calling me?  Get on your knees.  Oh, you finally said so.  Wow.  Good job, Amy.  Wow.  Wow, man.  I like that better than farting on the cake.  I bet. 
[03:43:00]  It looked like more fun.  It was a lot of fun.  God, man.  Duff, you all right?  Yeah.  I'm just fucking so angry at you.  It's not even funny.  Oh, they totally do it.  No, I know.  It's a good thing.  He likes to be angry.  No, he likes that.  That's what he likes.  He likes that.  It seemed like it.  See, now you're supposed to have sex with him.  That's how this all plays out.  Yeah, that's how it's supposed to work, right?  Smell your hand.  It smells like a Russian.  She ripped pubic hair out, by the way.  She was showing everybody the pubic hair.  No, I think that was his beard.  That was his beard.  That was his beard.  Same thing.  Oh, all right.  Same texture.  Yeah, it was. 
[03:43:30]  That's why I looked at him like, oh, I got pubes in my hand.  But then I realized he's shaved.  We get it.  Duff, here.  I got it like.  No way.  Yeah, take that.  I'm so fucking rich.  Thank you.  How was she giving him?  That's kind of weird.  You paid him for that?  What are you, into this?  Yeah, really?  Jesus Christ.  You're fucking old.  No, the fucking guy doesn't get paid still.  I gave him a little, a few bucks.  A girl touched his cock.  Yeah.  Gee, what a trooper.  You know what, though?  He needs money for his Russian brood.  I do. 
[03:44:00]  We'll try and go see Bob Kelly with her tomorrow night.  But the good news is, if she breaks up with you, then you got this girl.  All right, then.  I hope they can someday trace that money back that he bought a knife with it and killed  her.  Bag of lime.  A bag of lime, yeah.  Something private, I hit back really hard.  Much harder than you hit me.  Wow.  When you, with your Russian girl, or?  Oh, she can take a punch.  What?  Really well.  You hit her?  Yeah.  Not in the face or anything.  Not close.  In the gut? 
[03:44:30]  You punch her?  No, I like to eat her.  That's even worse.  Hitting her in the stomach?  Just hearing, oh!  I like to eat her, I like to eat her out and like, and just pull back and punch her like  right in the inner thigh.  Like right next to her vagina.  She likes that.  Do you ever slip and go elbow deep into her vagina?  No.  She likes that?  Yeah.  And then after you punch her pussy, did it ever go, you never got me down, Duff?  Does the fight doctor have to come in and cut over her pussy when it gets swollen? 
[03:45:00]  I'm going to freeze it.  Freeze it.  Does her pussy go cut me, you hick?  That was kind of my joke.  Listen to the replay.  Were you guys disturbed out there?  Is that all right for you?  I think that was all right.  This is my confused reaction.  There's somebody really fucking confused out there.  This lady right here is fucking appalled.  She's like, why am I here?  She was dragged here by her.  The lady in the front row.  Miss, come in here.  Yeah, come on in here.  Let's talk to this.  We're going to have your face.  She's like, no, I'm hard.  I'm fine.  No, I'm going to make the hair up and talk to you. 
[03:45:30]  Hey, our buddy's out there, too.  You guys.  Mets buddy.  What's up, bro?  I know you.  All right.  Hey, let's talk to Patty's sister.  Hi, Missy.  Hi.  Hi.  Hello.  Okay, what's your name?  Cindy.  Have you been here before?  No.  Oh.  Are you familiar with this program?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  All right.  You're a fan.  All right.  Is that your husband or boyfriend?  Boyfriend.  You were kind of covering his eyes before.  Yeah.  Do you want to fart on a cake or something?  No.  We've got two more cakes left.  I don't know.  You know what goes on on the show, then, so it's not really a bad, you know. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  I heard the whole thing before with the Russian thing, but just seeing it live.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was just like.  Did your boyfriend not like his testicles grabbed?  No.  No, huh?  No.  He doesn't like him twisted just to do it.  Look, she turned back to check.  He's not nodding.  Yes, I do.  Yeah.  I do.  She doesn't know.  Not with her.  Something weird going on between those two.  I think they have that kind of Duffy relationship in private.  Look at your little feet.  I know.  I'm very many.  Look at your little tootsies. 
[03:46:30]  She's got little feet, Jimmy.  I'll say she does.  Yeah.  I want to hang her sneakers on my mirror.  What size little tootsies do you have?  Size three and children.  Oh, my God.  Size three and children?  She's got size three feet?  And children.  You got little Japanese lady feet.  But you're like five, what?  One, two?  Four eleven.  Look at my face.  What?  Four eleven.  Oh, you are?  I know.  My kids usually say I'm a dwarf, but I'm not.  Well, officially you are, I think.  Yes.  Four ten.  Four ten.  Four ten is the cutoff.  You missed it by an inch, huh?  Yeah.  I think you squeezed an inch. 
[03:47:00]  You're trying to squeeze an inch on me somewhere?  That's embarrassing.  By the way, Pat, Lindsay Cole from St. John, Canada.  Laugh, LOL.  Nice comeback, Duff.  Being called a fag and you say, no, I'm not.  I felt I had to say something.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  I was really just telling myself.  Can we, like, walk on your testicles or something today? 
[03:47:30]  You, personally?  Not me.  I love you, Duff.  I would do it, too.  Well, have her do it with her little feet.  Yeah, have a little feet testy walk.  There's Patty there, too.  Four foot eleven.  Would you walk on his testes with your tiny feet?  I'll open his back all the time.  Well, the back's a little different than the ball sack.  Would you walk on his ball sack with your tiny feet?  How much do I get?  How do you walk on his ball sack?  You should.  A hold on, hooker question just popped up.  I know this show. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, well.  I mean, what, are they laying on the floor and fucking step on him?  If you place your balls on that table, she could step on them while you're on, you know.  Oh, yeah, I guess we are.  We got a dominatrix for you next week.  A professional.  Yeah.  We got your professional ball.  Yeah, we don't want to shoot the load, you know, here.  Good point.  Yeah, we don't want you to dribble little cumzies.  Yeah.  Hey, Duff, Duff, did that turn you on at all, what you did?  Yeah.  It did, really?  Yeah.  When she dragged you to your knees by your balls?  Bobby, you didn't see him get kicked in the balls? 
[03:48:30]  When?  That was like a week ago or two.  It was insane.  You didn't hear about that?  You just took a deep breath.  They're going to make me do it again.  Oh, he got fucking nailed in the nuts.  Really?  No, I've never seen that.  It's insane.  You want to teach Norwegian and Italian broad how to kick you right?  One kick?  All right.  One kick.  I don't want to be like one trick pony guy.  We're just trying to get the Russian broad pissed off to have a good weekend.  Oh, that's a lot of explaining to do.  I think I feel bad if I kick him in the nuts.  No, he likes it. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, I see that.  I don't want to be one trick pony guy.  I don't.  First, I'm puking and then shitting.  You got like ten.  That's two tricks right there.  Too late, Flicka.  Hey, Bobby, there's the video up here.  Look.  Pony joke.  Watch this kick.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Watch this kick, Bobby.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Oh, shit.  Look, look.  Then he punches the wood.  My hand still hurts.  Yeah, I think he might have broke your knuckles or something. 
[03:49:30]  Oh, that was awesome.  And then...  We need to get good audio on that.  Yeah.  Watch this, Bobby.  This one...  Watch this.  Watch this.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Watch this long motion.  That's a good one.  Damn.  That is fun.  Yes.  Keep an eye on the Foundry Music logo.  Yeah, follow the Foundry Music logo. 
[03:50:00]  I'll be Anthony with some fucking weird Turkish font.  I know.  It's like the fucking Al Jazeera writing.  Fucking cake icing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It looks...  You're right, Jimmy.  It looks Arabic.  It's horrendous.  It's in the white up there.  Yeah.  Big block letters.  Foundry music.  It's hidden in plain sight.  If you stare at it and cross your eyes, you're C.O.P. and Anthony.  Thanks.  All right.  Coffee, man.  How did you go from, like, not drugs, not drinking, that clean-cut kid, to fucking this? 
[03:50:30]  Well, this has always been there.  The violent side of me has always been there.  My whole life.  It's just now more emphasized.  Can you fucking blink when you talk to me?  No.  You're fucking scaring me.  Yeah, don't be scary.  When I talk about that side of me, I just tend to become Pat Bateman.  Duffy is a little scary.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right, dude.  All right.  Pat Duffy, everyone.  Pat Duffy.  Fucking Duffy.  That's what I say.  Wow.  I guess we've got to start wrapping up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to thank the tiny...  He's got to eat the cake.  He's got your whiskers in his cake. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, you've still got to eat the cake.  Only in that right corner.  This right here is her...  That's my vagina.  Her fucking vagina looks like a weird S.  He's scooping out the vagina like he's done this before.  On a real woman.  Ready?  Yummies.  Yeah.  Wait, what happened?  What happened?  What happened?  I wanted to point out a pubic hair on it, but I already ate it.  All right.  That was probably the ones I rubbed from your face on there, because I did put your face  stuff on there.  Yeah.  I get it.  Yeah. 
[03:51:30]  He's such an idiot.  I kind of do want to kick him in the nuts.  I know.  Pat Duffy.  There he goes.  He just brings it on himself.  You all right?  I hate myself, so...  That's cool.  You're not alone.  God damn it, man.  Is he a fucking fine...  He is a fucked up individual.  He really is a head case.  Something is wrong with him, but it makes for good radio, so fuck it.  What do we care?  What do you think?  Another fucking just destroyed life in our wake that we leave.  Another destroyed life, but another fucking pool party for you. 
[03:52:00]  Exactly.  Can I go?  Yeah, you're done.  Fuck no.  I don't need a salt charger.  Find a body in the cabana.  Know who did it.  Chocolate cake icing all over a fucking plot.  You should invite Pat Duffy to your barbecue.  Why would I do that?  Pat, go to my place.  I got a wedding to go to.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you...  No, I thought you said go to your place.  Oh.  Fucking house, sis.  Hope he just invited you to his place.  All right.  I won't touch anything.  He lives high up in a building.  You could push a bitch out a window. 
[03:52:30]  All right.  Hey, we didn't talk...  She jumped.  We didn't talk to Saul Rosenberg today.  The Saul...  Sounded like guy.  Who?  Remember this guy.  Come in here.  I forgot his name.  What's your name again?  What's your name, bro?  Ten.  I already agreed to Master Poe not to go on the air.  Master Poe told him not to go on the air.  Why would Master Poe tell you not to go on the air?  I don't know.  Just saying he told me.  I don't know why. 
[03:53:00]  Go ahead.  Ask him.  I didn't realize that we...  I was going to say change is actually produced.  I should say had one.  I don't know.  Steve.  Hello.  I have no idea why.  He just told me before.  Steve, why...  There's a meteor headed toward Earth.  Why is Master Poe telling people not to go on the air?  That's up to us.  That's our fucking job.  No, let's leave Poe off the air.  No, I want to know why.  He's right there.  I'm booking guests. 
[03:53:30]  Call me Roland Poe.  He also said that you went to Human Resources first.  Master Role.  That's why he went to Human Resources.  Oh, that's an outright lie.  I know.  Why did you go to Human Resources?  Yeah, why would you do that, Steve?  Because I fuck things up.  Please isolate that and use it.  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, look at that.  E-Rock smiling jumped on it to market down to the tenth of a second.  Poe, why are you telling this guy not to go on the air?  He has a disability. 
[03:54:00]  He has a disability and Steve knows he's not a disability.  We let E-Rock get on the air and work here.  We're not allowed to have people with disabilities on the air?  Of course we are.  Exactly.  The whole fucking staff would have to be quiet.  And the bleachers.  Are we discriminating?  Ah, fuck you.  You laugh when it's us.  We're discriminating against the...  The whatever.  The whatever's.  You know what it is?  Here's what I think.  Here's my interpretation of the ruling that came across. 
[03:54:30]  I believe exploitation of somebody with a mental handicap...  That's right.  ...or a physical handicap...  We're not exploiting...  ...is probably a problem.  Yes.  Just talking to somebody...  ...is allowed.  ...is allowed.  I would say that's allowed.  If we wanted this lovely girl to pull his balls and pull his beard...  That would be exploitation.  That would probably be exploitation because he probably wouldn't know what the fuck he's doing...  ...or what would happen...  ...and he'd make cumsies in your hands. 
[03:55:00]  But a little chit-chat with a microphone...  ...I think is fine.  Steve, ruling?  What do you think?  No!  Don't even look at him!  All right.  All right.  Let's bring in stupid.  No!  Jesus.  Oh, my God!  I can take a job.  I can take a job.  Of course you can.  Believe me.  Just right now, everything that's happening today...  ...this is all what drew me to the show in the first place... 
[03:55:30]  ...back in your NEW days.  Exactly!  See?  I've been listening to you guys since...  ...I think about 2000.  You guys, there was an article about you.  I forgot what paper.  Yeah, probably some fucking...  ...drag.  I don't know.  I think it was either the Newsday or the Daily News.  Yeah.  Either one.  Now, what did you think of what you saw today?  Did you enjoy the cake farting?  Oh, believe me.  It was Radio Gold.  Yeah?  Ah.  It was Radio Gold.  I downloaded it.  Makes me wish I had satellite radio. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, you don't?  Oh, yeah?  You don't have one?  No, I don't, but there's a way you could arrange for me to get a subscription.  Oh, why wouldn't we do that?  Yeah.  Yeah, it'd be nice.  Sounds pretty smart to me.  That'd be nice to subscribe to you.  Anybody does.  Jeez.  Touche, you fucking little worm.  Oh, God damn you.  What about Pat Duffy getting his beard and his cock pulled at the same time?  That's also Radio Gold, also.  Why?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's just funny getting someone, seeing someone get his ass kicked by a girl. 
[03:56:30]  That's why.  Oh.  Make sure Pat doesn't hear that.  Oh, Russia Broad's here.  Uh-oh.  Oh, I was here for that.  That one was a, that's a classic, that one.  With the kicking to the nuts?  I love his voice.  That's why he's got to be on the radio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a classic.  Classic.  All right.  You know what?  You get the special C in the corner.  Special C for you.  Oh, good.  Is it reputable?  I have a Civil War member, Abelia.  You guys know I was a Jerky Boy fan back in the day. 
[03:57:00]  Of course you are.  Do you do laser treatments?  I have a hemorrhoid.  It's tearing the ass out of me.  I have a foot, a boot with a forehead.  And you're a Mets fan.  Let's hope they can keep it together at the end of the season, right?  Oh, I hope so.  Well, I wear these glasses, though.  I can't see, God damn it.  I had a cannon in the backyard.  It went...  Actually, I can see, but some things look blurry without them.  And you can't. 
[03:57:30]  I was very hurt.  Now, if you want to know your cancer, you should be washed apart.  And my shoes fell off.  You should take my mother out at night.  She can hardly see anything at night.  Take my mom, please.  What did you say about your mother?  Your mother can't what?  See anything at night?  Yeah?  Yeah, she can.  She's a juvenile diabetic.  Oh, sorry.  How old is she?  What?  I have no freaking idea.  I just know she was born sometime in the early 60s.  Oh, yeah?  How is she still a juvenile? 
[03:58:00]  I guess that's what they call it if you've had diabetes since then.  Is it childish diabetes?  No.  If they go, na-na-na-na-na-na, and her toe falls off.  No, it means she's had diabetes since she was a child.  Oh, he's right.  I understand.  Hey, can I see your glasses?  Oh.  No.  What?  No problem.  No problem.  Here.  Don't, uh, I wouldn't give him.  No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't give him the glasses.  Don't do it.  Don't.  Don't.  Just don't give him the glasses. 
[03:58:30]  Come on, give Opie your glasses.  Don't give him the glasses.  Opie's looking like, do you honestly think I said that?  Eight guys just ran in here.  Don't fucking do that.  That's all right.  What happened?  I wouldn't worry about it.  I can actually see very well.  If I'm watching TV, if the screen's big enough, I can see it.  Yeah.  How many cocks in my house?  Gotta go to a drive-in fucking theater.  Oh.  Nothing.  No, you just need something the size of my uncle's TV.  Uh-oh.  That also.  Yeah.  Which one do you like the best?  Uh, Uncle Paul.  Come on. 
[03:59:00]  That's who I am.  They know.  I'm in on that fit now.  That's my name.  Don't wear it out.  I like that fit.  They know.  Captain Obvious over here.  As a matter of fact, I think you should, you should meet my Uncle Mike.  You and him would get along very well together.  Oh, homo?  He's in.  No.  No, I don't mean it like that.  I mean, he's in, he's into hunting.  You could go hunting out in upstate.  I don't like hunting.  I like shooting.  I like target shooting, but I don't like killing things, so I don't like hunting.  Don't shoot Uncle Mike, go hunting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You could, you could, you could run up and make the pheasants fly. 
[03:59:30]  And Uncle Mike will shoot them.  I'll shoot them.  I'll flush them out.  And then you can jump in the lake and get the duck.  Wow.  Yeah.  Was it, I was a little too eager on that one too.  Wow.  You put attitude behind it and everything.  And you could jump in the lake and get the duck.  And it's perfectly clipped delivery.  I get the duck.  I have seen one of his trophies at his old house in Queens.  Wait, could you wait until someone diffuses his last joke? 
[04:00:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Oh.  Wow.  He has it locked away in a closet, but back in the day, he had a deer head hanging.  He used to use it as a hat rack.  That's a good idea.  All right, listen, he's a, he's a big fan of our show.  Yeah.  And of course, he's a fan of pinwheels as well.  So that's not saying much.  Thank you, sir.  What's your name again, for real?  Name's Danny.  Danny, that's right.  What are those sneakers?  He comes by all the time.  They're like Jordans or something.  I don't know.  These are some Jordans that my uncle vaguely used. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, it's like that episode of Star Trek with Frank Gorshin.  Okay.  Star Trek geeks in the room can laugh.  I just made a joke for one person.  I didn't actually hear what you said.  No, and you won't.  Well, we got some, we got some newbies to the voice.  Someone's writing.  He sounds like the pharmacist from Family Guy.  Well, that's the same guy.  Yeah, it's the same guy.  Yes.  And Danny, you know, he's here all the time.  He's welcome.  Damn audio.  He's always sitting on those bleachers. 
[04:01:00]  What's going on with the Russian broad?  Everyone needs to know, Pat.  Is she pissed off at the Norwegian Italian broad that did the cake farting?  She wants to have a word.  Oh, Russian broad in the studio.  She's got the sexy black on.  Oh, who's the bitch that pulled the balls?  I didn't.  He told me to do it.  Yeah.  Look how she just points her finger.  Is everything they tell you to do?  Yeah, exactly.  It's the only first time I've been on the show.  Even better.  No, no, it's okay.  You can pull the balls if you want.  I can't believe I just got blamed.  It would probably be the last time he scared me. 
[04:01:30]  What?  He scared me because he was yelling in my face.  Yeah, I got a little out of control.  She never saw her.  Who'd yell at her?  I told her she couldn't hurt me.  And I backed away because of the way he yelled at me.  Well, I think it's only appropriate.  Russian broad is very mad at Pat.  I think you should kick him just one.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know he had to go.  One kick to teach him a lesson, I'm thinking.  What do you think, Bobby?  Because we don't want any catfighting or anything.  Well, the thing is, what I learned in therapy is if you get it out, then you feel better.  If you keep it in, that's what causes problems. 
[04:02:00]  I think if you let it out on Pat, then you'll have it.  Do you think these will do some damage?  Yeah.  Those are awesome.  Those are beautiful.  Thank you.  Russian broad.  Now, you have to scold Pat and say, you know, you're not allowed to have other girls pull  your cock and your beard, only me, and then kick him hard in the balls.  How about you have to tell him that no one else can pull his cocking balls?  It would be funny if you stretched his fucking cocking balls out and then just give it a  nice smack.  What do you think?  I'm down for anything.  You look like Uncle Fester took Morticia's outfit. 
[04:02:30]  He just made that up and they're like, okay.  Oh, by the way, we're invited to Anthony's school party.  He said he likes us.  Oh, really?  What?  What the hell is that going to happen?  And a house sit at Opie's house.  Jesus.  Wow.  And my show.  You can come tonight.  Oh, thank you, Bob.  On your seats.  All right.  This is the grand finale.  So now you got to make sure Pat doesn't do that again.  Russian broad.  So what are we doing?  Come here, you asshole.  Oh, yeah. 
[04:03:00]  No, no.  You deserve it.  All right.  You deserve it.  You're right.  All right.  Well, a nice speech before you kick him.  This is the grand finale of today's show.  This is the one kick that's going to kill me.  Was she born here or could she be deported?  Should you take your shoes off?  I told her she doesn't want to.  Are you going to hurt more?  Why is she wearing it?  Wait, wait, wait.  You're going to...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, but wait.  You can't hurt him too bad.  Yeah, don't destroy the ball.  Take your shoes off.  Yeah, you got it for us.  Yeah, we got it.  You got it.  You can't let it die. 
[04:03:30]  All right.  She's mad that she has to take off her massively.  I know, but she has to give him a good swift kick in the balls.  Are you wearing a Miller dress?  No, it's a Miller shirt.  All right.  All right, here we go.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  That's the point.  Wait, guys, end scene.  Here we go.  I have to make my speech first.  All right.  Make your speech.  All right.  You are an asshole, first of all.  Okay.  To let some other bitch kick you in the balls, you don't fucking deserve me. 
[04:04:00]  Oh, fuck.  Holy down he goes.  Wow.  Fuck.  Lesson learned.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  Duffy, all right?  Oh, and he just slapped her.  Oh, and she slapped him. 
[04:04:30]  That is love.  Oh, come on, Duffy.  You're going to get away with that?  See, we're perfect.  All right.  Why don't you guys have sex now while we do line of the day?  We got to get out of here.  Kidding me as fucking cock as a black eye.  That was a bad kick, Pat.  That was one of the...  That was a bad one, huh?  Mm-hmm.  That was a bad one.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm all right.  I taste blood.  But I'm all right.  Really?  Well, that's from the punch.  I'm okay, though.  Totally good.  You're sweating, dude.  Yeah, I'm a sweater.  Yeah?  Pat, maybe you want to, like, protect the balls.  I don't know.  You want to be a father someday? 
[04:05:00]  No.  Don't you rub his balls after that?  Or do you just kick him and leave him...  I kick him and leave him to his agony.  Really?  It's better that way.  Yeah.  Really?  Because I'm by myself.  It savors the emotion.  Is there some love going on between you two, or is this kind of a...  It's based in hatred.  It's blossoming.  It's a little bit of both.  Really?  Well, a girl willingly kicks me in the balls and eats my asshole.  Obviously, I'm going to love her.  Yeah, call him a faggot.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Call me a fag now.  I think she already did.  Bye, buddy. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, she eats ass.  Several times.  Jumping G-Hosifat.  That was fucking hard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can I come to the pool party now?  Yeah.  No, not with those big fucking swollen black and blue balls in my hot tub.  In my lukewarm tub.  Little kids can use them as floaties.  He can ice down his balls in your jacuzzi.  That's the joke.  Come on.  Of course.  Hey, Pat, could she eat your ass while we do line of the day? 
[04:06:00]  Pain and pleasure.  That's what we're about on this show.  That's right.  I have a pretty dirty ass, so I'm going to have to decline on that.  I want to have a clean butt.  I think that would be up to her to decide.  Yeah.  What are you, all of a sudden, it's religion?  What are you?  This show just never stops being what it is.  Like, as soon as you're like, oh, that's enough for a great two days.  Yeah, can you eat his fucking asshole while we do the fucking wrap-up?  Shitting one day, a fart in the cake, fucking ball pulling, ball kicking, and dirty ass eating. 
[04:06:30]  Now line of the day.  We do bits all the way up the sidewalk until we say goodbye finally.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Kick this homeless guy.  Piss on me.  20 minutes left.  Of what?  And then we lose what?  And then we cut out.  Come on.  I got a Ferrari waiting out for that.  All right.  Line of the day.  Sponsored by Carbonite.com.  Carbonite backs up your computer hard drive so you never have to worry.  You're picking up the new gun today?  No.  I picked it up.  I got a Sig 556.  Sweet.  Rifle.  It's unbelievable.  I heard those are actually no good.  Uh, yeah, yeah, they're horrible. 
[04:07:00]  Pat, you gonna be all right?  That was a bad kick.  Yeah, I'm all right.  I just need to sit down.  I'm not gonna lie to you.  That was a bad one right there.  That was worse than the kicks on the video.  Yeah.  I know.  You gotta tell her to come the fuck down.  Yeah, she wound up and fucking smashed your balls.  She really takes pleasure in it.  And there's a kick happy.  And then you slapped her really hard.  What happens if she decides, you know what, fuck this, and then, you know, next thing there's  like, problems.  Well, what do you mean by problems?  Well, she goes to the authorities with a black guy or something.  A black guy?  What's up, and I'm putting you in a fake plastic garbage bag. 
[04:07:30]  Oh, a black guy.  Yeah, right?  Anyone else want to give Pat Duffy money, you're more than welcome.  This is the donation part of the show.  I literally...  Pat Duffy works for free, so if you want to throw a few...  There you go.  I literally...  I literally didn't...  I literally didn't eat dinner last night, so if anybody would like to pay...  Why?  I didn't have money for it.  Why don't we pass the hat down around?  This is like a church.  Thanks, retard.  I feel bad for him.  Later on, he's going to bite her clit off like one of those dots on the paper rolls.  He told me he's hungry. 
[04:08:00]  I said, eat my pussy, that's your dinner.  Oh, gross.  Oh, saucy.  You better put some mashed potatoes in there.  He looks hungry.  All right.  Nothing?  No, and I shouldn't have had anything.  I was so close to the end of the show.  I hate that.  You've got to redeem yourself.  That's what line of the day is for.  At least you crashed into soft mashed potatoes.  Call me crazy with these two, but I see...  You're crazy.  I see too much pain and not enough pleasure. 
[04:08:30]  Because as Pat Duffy's trying to breathe again, she's slapping him in the head.  But she's also rubbing his arm very gently.  Yeah, how about a little more pleasure?  Uh-oh, Jimmy, who's on the phone?  Whoa, what's up, man?  Give me more fucking news.  Jimmy just picked up his cell phone.  Yeah.  He's talking.  All right, Carbonite.com, promo code XM.  It does something with your computer that I...  It backs up your files.  So you never lose, you don't have to worry about your hard drive taking your crap,  and you lose all your files.  That's right.  That sucks.  All right.  Who's passing the hat around for Pat Duffy out there? 
[04:09:00]  Got to go to the FBI and pick him back up again.  There's a guy right there with the hat.  The guy with the one tone.  Bombing, bombing, bombing.  I know.  I want to try to get Pat a few more bucks.  That's good news, Pete.  He's got a...  What are you giving him there, dumbbell?  Fuck Pat and his money.  I have a fucking $200,000 car I want to drive home.  All right.  Fuck this bum.  He's got 10 bucks.  Pat, 10 bucks.  He's got 10 bucks for you.  What?  What, do I got to dance for 10 bucks?  He's got a 20?  This guy's got a 20?  Peace!  Come on, they're giving you money.  Just get the money.  Pat works for free for your entertainment. 
[04:09:30]  Pass the money back.  There you go.  Oh, you're the man.  Who else?  All right.  Thank you.  That's it?  It's a contribution.  You don't have to give money.  Look at that, Pat.  If you want to, that's great.  Crispy fiber from old Jimmy Norris.  Wow.  Thank you.  Jimmy.  How much you can make, Pat?  Followed by an Andrew Jackson.  That makes it 25.  We can back 15.  Yeah, did you make change?  Now it's...  All right.  Take the Russian broad out.  I only have...  Take her out, torture each other's genitals. 
[04:10:00]  Hey, Pat, I'm going to give you a little money, too.  There you go.  I got one.  Jesus.  You only have Confederate money to give him.  Yeah.  Pat.  What did you say, Dan?  What, are you giving him a buck?  You're giving him a buck.  No, I give it to him in piecemeal, so it's like bigger.  You don't say in piecemeal, you just say piecemeal.  All right.  Thanks, Jim.  All right.  You're trying to help you from humiliating all of us.  You're giving a fuck.  You're giving a fuck.  You're giving a fuck.  That's the crap.  Thank you.  Fucking get money here, you goddamn fuck.  How much are you giving?  Oh, come on, Ant.  Why don't you give him a five?  Because I don't have any change.  Give him a hundred.  I only have a twenty. 
[04:10:30]  I didn't have a fucking hundred.  You guys just bought a giant egg of weed.  Jeff, great.  No, you can't.  Great.  That's wonderful.  That's wonderful.  Buy drugs with it.  That's nice.  I don't do drugs.  Buy fucking apples with mine.  Trying to do the right thing.  Buy hugs.  Buy drugs.  That's wonderful.  I have.  All right.  You and the brush.  Could you hug my prick with your mouth?  All right.  Runner-up lines of the runner-up.  Well, whatever.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  Yeah.  We're all going to be fired. 
[04:11:00]  The new Steve bit.  Love it.  Oh, fuck it.  From lethargy to panic.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, boy.  They fell for it again.  They got me.  Yeah, they fell for it.  You don't have to leave yet.  Oh, okay.  Oh, because Pat told us to leave.  Oh, okay.  I mean, you don't have to leave the building.  What?  Well, no.  You two have to leave.  She doesn't because...  No.  What?  I'm sorry.  I'm going to boot the audience out.  Who's leaving?  No one.  You're all set.  You're supposed to stay. 
[04:11:30]  You're cool.  No, you can all stay.  We're sitting there.  But I'm in there.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Is the hot tub going to be hot this time?  Let's hope so.  If not, it gets a fucking doo-doo in it.  Does not someone have a little shit?  Coin City, you hot tub.  Hot toilet.  That's hilarious.  Jimmy.  It makes me laugh.  What was it again?  Hate Speech Radio?  Give them a plug for the kick farting.  Cringe Humor.  Right? 
[04:12:00]  Cringe Humor.  Cringe Humor Radio?  What?  Cringe Humor Radio.  Hate Speech Radio on CringeHumorRadio.com.  All right.  Guys, thank you, because I know we kind of took your bit.  Yeah.  It's the BJ Radio.  That's all right.  You did this.  We happily give it to you.  All right.  Enough.  An homage.  Steve has two gears, right?  Two gears.  Yep.  Glacier and healthy God.  I didn't get that one.  Oh, dude.  Nice.  Steve got a bashing today.  I got bad news about my Boston show, too.  What?  What happened? 
[04:12:30]  There's only 200 tickets left.  Damn.  Jimmy, look at you with the little sellout.  I started yesterday on that thing.  Yeah, it's 1,100 seats.  That's in October.  You're going to have to do two shows.  I think I'm only doing one.  You should do two.  Why are you screaming at me in front of everyone?  Because you don't listen.  That's awesome, Jimmy.  Yeah, Boston tickets.  There's only a couple hundred left.  That was Pete on the phone telling me that the pre-sale was a big hit.  So go to Ticketmaster, you fucking douchebags.  Yeah, hurry.  And I'm at the Stress Factory, too.  Fucking who cares?  He's so nasty with his plugs. 
[04:13:00]  How the fuck are they supposed to buy tickets for the plug like that?  Buy some fucking tickets.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  We're getting the Silence of the Lambs mask for E-Rock so he doesn't partake.  Yeah, we got to put the mask on him.  Wheel him past it on a hand truck.  Yeah, because E-Rock can't help himself.  We all know that.  You will let me know if that stomach stops rumbling.  Poor E-Rock.  E-Rock, he wanted to dig in to Sam's breakfast, but he didn't want to do it in front of us. 
[04:13:30]  Bob Kelly, Caroline's.  Caroline's, tonight.  Yes.  2-1-2.  Saturday.  7-5-7.  Sunday.  4-100.  Come down.  Come down to the show.  7-5-7.  Pack it up.  4-100.  That's right.  This weekend only, big show.  Your commercial running on 2-0-2 is hilarious, by the way.  Oh, is it?  Fucking hilarious.  Okay.  Which one is it?  You're just making fun of all the fans, and then say, well, if you're one of those, then  come see my, whatever.  It's very clever.  Another runner-up line of the day. 
[04:14:00]  All right.  Let's start the news with Big A, everyone.  Oh, my God. 
[04:14:30]  That one was ponderous.  I love that bit.  Mine of the daytime.  This is it.  Everybody else get their plugs in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pat Duffy and Russian Broad, thanks to them.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  It's Friday at 11 fucking 30.  T-G-I-F, I say.  If that guy has to go around the block, I've got to wait 45 fucking minutes.  Who's that guy? 
[04:15:00]  The guy that's waiting outside with my car.  Oh, nice.  Line of the day.  Here it is.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  All right.  And now, Pat's blowing.  All right, stop.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Ready?  Wait, no, not yet.  Hold on.  Please, hurry.  That hurt.  I'm ready.  Yes.  Oh, is that a great sound? 
[04:15:30]  Yeah, that kick farting worked after all.  Boy, they're quick.  Mick Foley called in to the Opie and Anthony XM radio show on Friday to wish show personality  primetime Sam Roberts a happy birthday.  And then proceeded to talk about Vince McMahon, and he revealed that he's going to be on TNA.  Wow, yeah, they do pick up on shit quick. 
[04:16:00]  The wrestling sites don't fuck around.  Sam, happy birthday.  Thank you.  All right.  Later.  Later.  Hey, this is intern Pat Duffy, and you're listening to me desperately seek attention on Opie and Anthony.  This will not be over quickly.  You will not enjoy this.  Oh, that was fun.  Opie and Anthony.  I'll see you next time.  Oh, my.  This is fun.  I'll see you next time.  This is fun. 
[04:16:30]  I'll see you next time. </pre>
