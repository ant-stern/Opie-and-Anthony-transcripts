<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sandy Kane and James Brown in studio.  The hosts initially discussed FHM Magazine ranking their "Team Voyeur Bus" among the top 20 coolest vehicles, prompting a countdown of the list which included The Tank, the General Lee, and the Lunar Roving Vehicle.  This transitioned into a discussion of *Miami Vice* and its enduring appeal to a staff member, Earl.

The majority of the show centered on a highly controversial contest initially titled "Rape" (later renamed "Run Around Park for Erin," and further modified to avoid the offensive acronym).  The contest involved a woman, Erin, being placed in Central Park; the first listener to find her and remove her panties would win a trip to WrestleMania.  The announcement sparked a furious debate involving numerous callers, staff, and eventually, their boss, Ken Stevens, who vehemently disapproved.  The hosts grappled with the legality and potential negative publicity, fielding a wide range of reactions from outrage to enthusiastic support, along with numerous crude alternative contest suggestions.  They attempted to mitigate the offensive aspects of the initial name and concept throughout the segment, proposing alternative rules involving a frying pan, golf tees, or a different person altogether.

The show also featured a discussion about Napsterâ€™s legal troubles and the music industry's struggles with copyright infringement.  Listener calls offered diverse opinions on the subject.  Comedian Jay Moore called in to discuss his role in *Cherry Falls*, and the show promoted an upcoming "Best Ass Contest."  Comedian Louis Black, experienced with the show's past controversies, offered his perspective on "Run Around Park for Erin."

A significant portion focused on then-Vice President Dick Cheney's health, gun control (with Louis Black participating in the debate), and the hosts' disdain for weathermen.  They promoted a comedy benefit for the Jerry Red Wilson Foundation, featuring Louis Black, Jim Brewer, and Adam Ferrara.  A chaotic and heated phone call with James Hetfield of Metallica ensued, followed by a rambling call from someone claiming to be President George W. Bush.

The show concluded with a deeply disturbing news story about a 16-year-old who killed her newborn baby, prompting strong reactions and further discussion about the death penalty.  Jim Norton called in throughout the show, adding to the chaotic and offensive nature of the broadcast, which was characterized by frequent profanity, sexually explicit discussions, and violent topics.  Anthony also mentioned receiving large flowers from MafiaMob.com, jokingly suggesting it might be a threat.  The broadcast further included a recurring segment where callers shared what they had "learned" that day, often in a sarcastic or absurd manner.  The discussion about the infant's death included graphic descriptions and misogynistic, racist, and other offensive language from the hosts and callers.  The entire show demonstrated a highly inappropriate and vulgar tone.

[00:02:30]  Another great eight-minute radio show.  Rocked.  It did rock.  Segue of the year today.  I don't know, I kind of like yesterday's better.  Filter and the slipknot, that's not an easy job.  Pretty good.  We're not going to bore you with the weather and how the weathermen amped up and all.  It's what it is. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Screw it.  They suck and we got to move on.  Enjoy the weather.  Can we get rid of all the people that want to tell Ben he did a great job today?  Yeah.  I think we know.  I'm getting a bit jealous.  It used to be your gig.  It used to be our gig, you know?  Ben's getting the credit. 
[00:03:30]  Segging the tunes.  All right, we got lots to do today.  Lots and lots to do.  Yes.  Got new little contests coming up.  Yeah, why don't we do a little show thing here?  Tell you all the things that are coming up on the radio show, all right?  Yeah, yes.  We just got out of a huge little, huge meeting in the back office.  First off, I want to thank the fine folks at FHM Magazine.  Uh-huh.  The whole Voyeur Bus thing made the magazine.  It's in the latest issue. 
[00:04:00]  What is it called?  It's called 16 Top 20 Coolest Vehicles.  Coolest Vehicles.  And the Team Voyeur Bus made it.  They got a picture of the Team Voyeur Bus with the WNW banner on the side.  It mentions us.  It mentions that people got arrested.  What number were we?  We only made 16, Anthony.  Out of 20?  That's pretty good.  Who did we beat?  FHM's 20 greatest road machines of all time.  And coming in in 20th place, we beat the Deathmobile from Animal House. 
[00:04:30]  Wow, that's a cool vehicle.  Not bad, right?  We also beat the Batmobile.  Which one?  Huh?  The original Batmobile or the one from the movies?  Uh, the original.  Oh, yeah.  That thing wasn't too cool.  Anthony, we beat Herbie the Love Bug.  Herbie the Love Bug?  Who could forget that Disney extravaganza?  And, uh, the Landspeeder.  From Star Wars?  Yes.  We beat that. 
[00:05:00]  Team Voyeur Bus beats the Landspeeder.  See, there's a little PC in this magazine.  They just call it the Voyeur Bus.  But you can't, uh, you can't blast, uh, womp rats out of the Team Voyeur Bus.  Team Voyeur Bus.  Luke did.  Uh, let's see.  The top 20 greatest road machines of all time.  Yeah, the Voyeur Bus comes in 16.  You can pick this up for yourself.  FHM Magazine, page 110.  The latest issue with, uh, that piece of ass Shannon Elizabeth on the cover.  You want to, you want to, uh, hear who beat us? 
[00:05:30]  No, I want to hear who beat us.  All right.  In 15th place, The Tank.  The Tank?  Remember The Tank?  The Tank.  The Tank.  I'm waiting, I'm waiting.  I'm thinking from...  It has nothing to do with TV.  Oh, it has nothing to do with TV shows or movies, I should say.  It's real life.  It's just The Tank?  Do you remember The Tank?  Damn.  Tank.  Tank.  It was a huge news story.  Oh, the guy that drove the tank through the, uh, city streets and, uh, they finally killed  him.  Yes.  In San Diego.  All right. 
[00:06:00]  Remember that video of him just rolling over cars?  Yeah.  On a, on a sunny afternoon in San Diego?  They use it in a commercial now.  Do they really?  Yeah.  And, and it's kind of morbid when you think the guy was shot at the end of that thing  and killed.  Mm.  All right.  Uh, in 14th place, The General Lee.  Yeehaw.  Uh, no, no, flash.  No.  In 13th place, uh, the Ferrari Daytona Spider from Miami Vice.  Hmm. 
[00:06:30]  Uh, in 12th place, though, Earl still watches that goddamn show.  Earl watches Miami Vice.  Every day after the show, he goes into the back office, into our office, and turns on Miami  Vice.  Like, Earl.  Can we get Earl down here?  What the hell?  You know, yeah, it was cool to watch when it first came out, but it's a little dated.  That show has 80s all over it.  It's like, got the 80s all over it.  Earl loves it, though.  Can't get enough.  Well, we'll find out why.  In 12th place, the Lunar Roving Vehicles. 
[00:07:00]  Well, those were pretty cool.  Sure, I could agree with that.  We're counting down the greatest road machines of all time because, uh, the Voyeur Bus made  it.  Mm-hmm.  The Teen Voyeur Bus in the latest issue of, uh, FHM Magazine.  Yeah.  Uh, 11th place, Shriner Mini Car.  Shriner Mini Car.  The Shriners Motor Patrol is so, uh, so serious about their go-karts that some even customize  their rides with full transmissions.  Oh, I've seen them.  Yeah.  You know what, uh, they're talking about there?  Yeah, the little cars and the Shriners go with their little caps on and, and go down  the street in their parades.  All right. 
[00:07:30]  Ah, 10th place.  This should have been a lot higher on the list.  My number one vehicle of all time.  What is it?  The Sky Cycle.  Ah, the X-1 Sky Cycle.  Evil Knievel, when he was going to jump over Snake River Canyon.  Right.  It wasn't a motorcycle.  He called it the Sky Cycle.  It was a rocket.  The Sky Cycle.  And the, the parachute came out when it, when it launched.  Yeah.  He didn't even get off of the launching ramp and the parachute came out.  Yeah, I was watching something on Evil, uh, recently, and he had no clue what was going  to happen with the Sky Cycle.  Nah.  They just kind of put it together and said, all right, we'll see what happens. 
[00:08:00]  I think, um, they expected, uh, the thing to launch, and then he pulls the chute right  away.  No way he was going to go to the other side of that canyon.  So, but he pulled it a little, uh, premature.  A little early.  It was still, uh, it was still great to see.  Uh, number nine, RoboSaurus.  Oh, is that that thing that the car and truck shows that eats the, uh, eats the cars and  the fire comes out of his mouth?  The white trash love the RoboSaurus. 
[00:08:30]  All right.  This is the thing.  Well, they're not arguing which truck is better, Ford or Chevy.  God damn, you gotta go with Bigfoot.  Go Ford.  Anyone who puts so much loyalty into the make of their car should just be shot.  Uh, Earl?  Unless you like Dodge.  Earl?  You should be shot anyway.  You watch Miami Vice after the show, Earl?  The last couple of days.  Oh, I, I watched the show, the scream, the one.  No, no, let me tell you something, Earl.  You make a point. 
[00:09:00]  It's not like you just happen to watch a couple of nights a week.  You make a point every effing night to go into our office and turn on Miami Vice.  And I say, well, Stinky, what do I say?  Hold on.  Who's putting this crap on?  And it's Earl.  Earl enjoys the show.  Well, then Stinky turns the conversation.  Right.  Where it should be.  But why, why, why the attraction to Miami Vice?  I would think a, it's a scream to watch.  It was, it was one of those shows.  You think the black guy was a role model?  Back in the 80s?  Philip Michael Thomas? 
[00:09:30]  Was that his name?  That was for me what the Brady Bunch was for you.  Did you see on the Daily Show?  They were doing some story on Don Johnson assaulting somebody in a bathroom.  And they run through the whole story and they say Don Johnson assaulted the person.  They run through the hows and whys and ifs.  And a witness to this can collaborate the story, corroborate the story.  It was Philip Michael Thomas who was working in the watch room.  And they had a big girl in that. 
[00:10:00]  So what's the attraction to Miami Vice now that it's the year 2001, Earl?  It's just a little nostalgia and that's all.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  I see you're wearing the Don Johnson beard today.  Cute.  Nice.  With the little sports belt.  Wait, you get the new shaver there that leaves that stubble?  I see you're wearing the...  It doesn't look the same on a black man.  You're wearing the little blazer thing with the t-shirt.  And you're wearing no socks.  Yeah, Earl, turn down your colors, man.  They're a little bright today. 
[00:10:30]  That show is just so 80s.  And the sad thing is, I remember when I first came out watching it,  I think it was one of those shows that premiered right after the Super Bowl or something.  It was one of those huge shows that premiered.  And I was just like, this is the coolest show ever, ever.  And then it was on in the office the other day.  And you laughed your head off.  So I'm sitting there watching it going, this is the worst show ever, ever.  It's horrible.  Exactly.  You laughed your head off and everybody did that show.  Hey, man, there was a time we thought Silver Spoons was cool, too.  I mean, you've got to move on, Earl.  Hey, hey, what? 
[00:11:00]  I'm just kidding.  Silver Spoons.  I was flipping around the other day.  I'm like, oh, my God, I love Ricky Schroeder.  You know what the best thing is?  And Gary Coleman.  Yeah.  I was in Silver Spoons.  They had the different strokes in there.  Gary Coleman was in this episode of Silver Spoons I was watching.  Was he playing the kids?  When the government had to come and I was watching for 30 seconds and maybe someone can help me with the plot line.  Oh, yeah.  The government came and were taking away their computer or something because they were...  And computers?  They were young hackers or something was going on. 
[00:11:30]  I'm like, kids with hacking and computers and what?  When was that at?  Like mid-80s?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, probably.  All right.  Mid-80s.  Earl, I noticed you're starting to grow your hair in a little bit.  You're going to try to get that Don Johnson poofy look to go along with your Don Johnson beard?  Hardly.  All right.  Can we move on?  Yes, please.  We're talking about the greatest road machines of all time.  Of which the Voyeur bus is number 16.  Yeah, it has our names and it has WNEW.  It tells how people were arrested.  It's pretty cool. 
[00:12:00]  I want to thank FHM Magazine for considering us for this.  Page 110.  So we count down the greatest road machines of all time.  We left off at...  Where were we, bro?  We were at the Sci-Cycle.  Yeah, okay.  And then the Robosaurus.  Okay, here we are.  Yeah.  Number 8.  The Sweet and Low Upholstery Truck.  What?  Cheech and Trunk.  Cheech and Trunk's truck.  Oh, the truck that was made out of weed.  Right.  From Up and Smoke. 
[00:12:30]  Hey, man.  That's number 8, Anthony.  Number 7007 Submarine Car from The Spy Who Loved Me.  I never saw someone eat so much acid in my life, man.  What did you give me, man?  Yeah.  In 6th place, EM50, otherwise known as the urban assault vehicle from Stripes.  Ah, Stripes.  Yeah, that was cool.  All right.  That could have been a great movie.  Yeah.  It just went a little too long.  It was really good at the beginning. 
[00:13:00]  And then it just kind of fell apart.  Turned into some lame pseudo-comedy action movie.  The greatest road machines of all time.  Number five, the Mystery Machine.  Yeah.  From Scooby-Doo.  Number four, the Tron Lifecycle.  Oh, my God.  Made it to fourth place.  Tron.  Anything to do with Tron should not be on the list.  Tron sucks.  Ugh.  Number three, the Fabulous Car, Anthony.  The Fabulous Car. 
[00:13:30]  Do you know what the Fabulous Car was?  It's got to be gay.  Hey.  Hey.  Any time you would use the word Fabulous.  Fabulous.  Not content with his 47 Cadillac sedan as it came off the assembly line,  ambitious auto mechanic Eli Lewis Mattar added a sink, a toilet, a stove,  a water heater, a refrigerator, a washing machine, and an iron to the back seat.  In the front, he put in a TV, a tape recorder, and a bar.  The radio antenna became a shower head, and a water fountain was installed on the rear fender. 
[00:14:00]  Who cares?  A kook.  Only then was he ready to drive cross-country without stopping, which he did in 1952 for  one non-stop, eight-day, 7,482-mile trip from Alaska to Mexico.  He also fit his fabulous caddy with the retractable auxiliary wheels, which lifted the car and let  him change a tire while still driving.  Interesting. 
[00:14:30]  That's a winner.  Fabulous.  All right.  Coming in at number two, Anthony, you got it over there.  Oh, yes.  The Mach 5.  Mm-hmm.  Remember that?  Speed racer.  The Mach 5.  Okay.  Jumped.  Had the little ram thing.  Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.  Had the saw blades that came out and cut down trees.  And all he would say as he's driving is, oh, oh, oh.  Number two of the Mach 5.  And finally, the greatest road machine of all time, according to FHM's magazine. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  You had it.  Christine.  Remember that?  Stephen King's movie?  Mm-hmm.  Christine.  It was a big 58 Plymouth.  Christine, number one.  I don't agree.  Don't agree.  Where is Grandpa's Dragula?  Yeah.  Remember Dragula from the Munsters?  It was the coffin that he laid in and the drags that rolled.  What about Knight Rider? 
[00:15:30]  Knight Rider.  Why not?  I can see that not making it.  Why?  What about the WNEW Opie and Anthony band?  Come on.  No, we're already represented in there with the voyeur button.  We should be represented twice.  I'm happy enough about that.  Here's someone that has the plot.  Why?  We did it right.  Here's someone that has the plot line from that Homer Spoons episode that I came across the other day.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I'm not real proud of it, but I saw it, too.  Ricky hacked into the FBI's secret stash of whatever files, and he copied some pictures of, like, a secret plane or something. 
[00:16:00]  And the FBI came to give him the death penalty.  And they confiscated his little computer, and Gary Coleman was his friend, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, he played Arnold, though, in the show, too.  His name was Arnold.  Oh, it was the same character?  I think so.  I don't know.  They called him Arnold, and then they ran away, and they confiscated all the newsletters,  because Arnold was the editor of the school newspaper or something. 
[00:16:30]  He was a fidget guy.  Something stupid like that.  All right.  Was it one of those crossover episodes where they used, you know, Arnold from different strokes  to help promote?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Could have been.  I think they did that also with Mr. T the day before.  Right.  All right.  Oh, wait.  Did I just admit I watched it twice in a row?  Sean.  I took a peek for, like, 30 seconds and moved on, because I'm like, oh, my God, Gary Coleman.  We just had him on the show recently.  You watched it too long.  All right.  Well, I took a peek two days in a row.  You watched the whole damn episode. 
[00:17:00]  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  Wait, wait.  One more thing, guys.  Yeah.  Hey.  Fox Family Channel, 6 o'clock, everyday Olsen twins.  Ah.  Did anybody catch them last night on 7th Heaven?  7th Heaven there.  They were making out with the brother in there.  Lots of feedback coming in that they looked hot.  They're getting there.  Oh, man.  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  A few other people want to add to this vehicle list.  Eric, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, what about the dogmobile from the Dumb and Dumber? 
[00:17:30]  There you go.  The dogmobile.  Is that really a cool vehicle?  Isn't it?  It was different enough to be on the list, I think.  I have another one.  Yeah.  The Beamer from James Bond.  Ah, yes.  Wasn't that a cool vehicle?  It was.  Remote control and everything.  I think you missed the James Bond car, Opie.  Did I?  Number 7.  007 submarine car.  No, we said that.  No, that was not from that movie, though.  Well, that was a cool car.  All right, Eric.  Thank you.  Better than that one that you're talking about.  Let's go to Kevin. 
[00:18:00]  Kevin.  No, Opie, don't be upset.  We know how you like weenies.  It's a Oscar Mayer wiener car.  Oscar Mayer wiener car.  The wiener mobile.  I know you like wieners.  You know, you're upset it wasn't on the top ten there.  Yeah, Kev, you got me.  I think he's trying to say something, Opie.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I figure, you know, you've been in the gay tendency of all these gay guests lately.  I figured you'd like the wiener mobile.  All right, Kev.  Nice try, though.  Glad you guys.  What?  I don't know.  Rich, what's going on? 
[00:18:30]  Hey, Rich.  Yeah.  What's up?  You're on the air.  I'm thinking the OJ car, guys.  That's famous, bro.  The white Bronco.  The white Bronco.  Yeah.  If they got the guy with the tank, they should have had another real life vehicle.  You know what I'm saying?  With the out-cowlings in the backseat?  Come on.  You don't get better than that.  Nice.  That should have made the list.  Thank you, Rich.  Peace out, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Kevin.  Kevin, what's up?  What's going on, man?  Hey.  What's going on with Ecto-1?  Huh?  From the Ghostbusters.  Oh, the Ghostbusters mobile. 
[00:19:00]  What about the DeLorean with all the cocaine in the back?  There you go.  There's one that should have been on the list.  Yeah, right?  Oh, the Back to the Future DeLorean.  Oh, the Back to the Future DeLorean.  Oh, the Back to the Future DeLorean.  Yes.  Yes, of course.  It's a big one.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  All right.  No doubt, guys.  How did the Back to the Future DeLorean not make it?  Dave, what's going on?  Travel through time, for God's sake.  Dave.  Yo.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, what about, like the guy said yesterday, where's the snow, Dick?  Where's the Urkel-Mobile, Dick?  The what?  The Urkel-Mobile, you know, the little... 
[00:19:30]  Oh, the Urkel-Mobile.  Yeah.  That was dope, dude.  That was dope, dude.  Did Urkel have a mobile?  He did?  Yeah, he had the car with the hood that popped open and everybody had to get in the front.  It was like a little clown car.  I wasn't an Urkel fan.  I'm sorry that I missed that one, Dave.  Thank you.  Mike's got a good one.  Mike, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  The car for Smokey and the Bandit.  Yes.  Oh, the...  That was the Trans Am.  The Trans Am, of course.  That was a gorgeous car. 
[00:20:00]  Very good.  What about Speed Buggy?  Speed Buggy?  Yeah, from the...  That Shaggy's voice was the guy Tinker also.  Oh, okay, okay.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Someone is saying the Jack car from Cannonball Run.  That was good.  That was Jackie Chan.  Jackie Chan was the guy driving that car in Cannonball Run.  No ass.  Jackie Chan was the only guy for the Godzilla movie.  All right. 
[00:20:30]  So, there you have it.  Pick up FHM Magazine.  The Voyeur Bus is in it.  Pretty cool.  It has a picture and everything.  Starsky and Hutch's Gran Torino.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Damn.  All right.  We should take a break, Anthony.  Yeah.  We are going to talk about our brand new contest.  Oh, no.  For a trip to WrestleMania.  Oh, no.  Where's WrestleMania this year?  Houston, I believe, right? 
[00:21:00]  Houston.  It's in Texas, Houston.  But why are we doing this?  Why are we doing this?  It's our new game called Rape.  And the winner will win a trip for two to WrestleMania.  We are dead serious.  No.  Details next.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Who else did you a bus filled with naked jeans that you could see from the street from their ass? 
[00:21:30]  What a day for new jeans.  Oh, come on.  You can't arrest the Voyeur Bus.  I agree.  You want a little dose of honesty?  You find it here on The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're a couple of idiots.  Filthy, disgusting, crazy idiots.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  It's the O&A Show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number. 
[00:22:00]  Well, we have this trip to WrestleMania, Anthony.  Yes.  We got to talk to Frank, though.  He's a little freaked out about our contest we're thinking of doing here.  Frank, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, I'm on takeout.  I called yesterday.  I'm off of work because of the weather.  Yeah.  I just don't want to lose the show over something like this.  I think you're going to have a hard time bringing this thing to completion.  Well, why don't we explain the game, and then maybe as a show, we'll let the listeners  involved and see if this is worth doing or not, okay? 
[00:22:30]  All right.  But also, if you're going to go through with this to some degree, this girl, Oren, we got  her sexual history yesterday.  She started when she was six.  Yeah.  It was amazing, incredible, riveting radio.  Yeah.  And she brought us to eight years old.  Yeah.  And she finished up at 10 years old.  Yeah.  And I believe she said she's 23.  So we got a lot of ground to cover with this girl before we get to the contest.  We got, if you could slowly just start at 11 and work your way through, I'd appreciate  it.  I think everybody else would, too.  Yeah.  I think we skipped about a decade there. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  If she wants to call back, we can find out what she did between the ages of, yeah, 10  and 20.  Yeah.  I'm begging you.  Very important.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, bud.  All right.  So, Anthony.  Yeah.  Here we go again.  We worked out the details of our rape game.  Yeah.  We want to see if this is feasible, okay?  So we'll just throw it out there, and then we'll take some questions from our listeners,  okay?  All right.  How does the contest work?  Well, we have a trip to WrestleMania. 
[00:23:30]  Where's that this year?  In Houston.  Houston, 10.  For two people, okay?  All right.  The WWF gave us the trip, and they're always looking for us to give it away in such a way  that'll create talk and, of course, you know, so they can get exposure for WrestleMania.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had a girl on the air yesterday.  Her name was Erin, and she pretty much told us about her sexual history.  Yeah.  And one of the things she liked to do was pretend she was raping other little girls. 
[00:24:00]  Rape fantasies.  Rape fantasies.  Which we just, we were fascinated by.  It's so out there.  It's so crazy.  You wouldn't think anybody would have these, but it is a sexual fetish that people have.  They are fantasies.  No harm comes to anybody.  They are fantasies.  Rape fantasies.  So a lot of girls started calling with their rape fantasies yesterday.  And we were amazed that there are so many girls that are into this kind of rape fantasy.  So we were thinking, like, wow, we might be on to something here. 
[00:24:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Kate has to jump in right away.  Kate, what's up?  Hey, I was listening to you guys yesterday about the rape game, and I wondered, you probably  should run it by Louis Black, since he's such a good litmus test of, you know, what a good  idea the border bus was.  Oh, yeah.  Can we get Louis Black on the air real fast?  Maybe we should.  We want to know about our latest idea.  Thank you, Kate.  Okay.  Take care.  Love you guys.  That's a great way.  We should decide if this is worth it or not.  Okay? 
[00:25:00]  All right.  So, yeah, the girls started calling like crazy with their rape fantasies and stuff.  Yeah.  And then this girl, Erin, said, you know, I'm not in a relationship right now, but I would  like to play some of these games.  Right.  Kind of kept it kind of vague.  Games.  Games.  So we came up with the rape game.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What we want to do.  You might want to slow down your vehicle.  Well, what we want to do within the next week is set a girl loose in Central Park. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  Girls set loose Central Park.  In Central Park.  You know, the park's a lot safer now than it was.  The girl's name is Erin.  Very important to our contest.  Okay?  Of course.  So we're going to set Erin loose in Central Park.  Yeah.  Now, everyone who wants to win the trip to WrestleMania in Houston will have to try to find Erin in  the park.  Yes. 
[00:26:00]  And pull the panties off of Erin.  Right.  And what does, what's the full name of this contest?  The full name of the contest is called the rape game.  Run.  Right.  R.  Run around park for Erin.  All right.  Run around park for Erin.  Right.  All right.  Well, that's better.  It's an acronym.  It's like tag.  It's like playing a game of tag.  Right.  And she's it.  She's it. 
[00:26:30]  You pull the panties off Erin.  You have the trip for two to WrestleMania in Houston.  It's a very simple concept.  Yes.  Already getting people that want to play.  William Kennedy Smith checking in and he wants he wants in.  He wants it.  Should we have a run around with a big blue dot over her face like in the trial of William  Kennedy Smith?  Well, we'll we'll dress her in such a way that, you know, it's Erin.  OK.  And we'll set her loose.  And right around three o'clock, whoever wants to try to win the trip to WrestleMania, we'll 
[00:27:00]  start running through the park looking for Erin.  I'm in.  I'm in.  Please.  Can I play?  I love this game.  I can't believe you're actually bringing it to the airwaves because this is one of my  favorite games.  I've been playing this for years.  You're ripping me on.  And all you have to do is rip the panties off Erin and you got the trip because there's  more than one person that have, you know, has has discovered Erin and earns running for  her life. 
[00:27:30]  The first person that gets the panties off her body.  Do you, um, do you understand there might be some people upset by this concept of a  contest?  Why?  What?  What happened?  Well, it's it's a sensitive subject, even though what we're doing is not really that.  It's sort of a play on this girl's fantasy that she has.  And who are we to not deliver a fantasy?  Good, bad or indifferent.  But I think it might strike a nerve with some people. 
[00:28:00]  But it's not what it is.  Run, run around park for Erin.  Uh huh.  You find Erin, you take the panties off her body and you got the trip to WrestleMania.  What's the problem?  The problem?  We could go on the air right now and say there's going to be no sex going on.  Oh, no.  No, we won't be sex.  Uh, Frank, what's going on? 
[00:28:30]  Opie.  Yo.  Since you're bound to determine to sponsor this game, I thought somebody should remind  you of a little lesson we all learned from the voyeur bus debacle.  You guys seem to remember the little trick that one of the convicts tried to teach Rick,  the old toilet paper butt plug.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Remember that one.  You may want to remember that because you may be playing the prison version of the rape  game very, very soon.  Frank, this game is completely legal.  There's nothing illegal about the rape game.  Call me crazy.  What's wrong, man? 
[00:29:00]  You're just with me.  What's wrong?  I just kind of have an uneasy feeling about this.  Hey, help me out here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Try to explain.  Oh, look what happened.  Oh, my God.  Look what happened.  Yes, look what happened when you hang up on people.  John, what's going on?  Yeah, I think you guys are crazy.  I know it's close to your contract time.  Yeah.  I guess you guys want to get fired.  You know what it is?  Uh, that's...  You want to...  It wouldn't be a...  It wouldn't be a bad thing. 
[00:29:30]  Come on.  You make great radio.  Don't get yourselves fired, please.  What?  You're playing.  They'll throw you guys in jail and they'll...  Why will they throw us in jail for a legal contest?  Oh, come on.  You know the mayor...  It's called the rape camp.  He's looking to throw you guys in jail for any reason.  Run around park for Erin.  Oh, yeah.  It would be fulfilling her fantasy.  It would be fulfilling her fantasy to a point.  See, we do have a line and we have a conscience.  We will not let our listener have sex with her. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, you're flirting with it.  You're flirting with death.  What's that, Rick?  This is legal, isn't it?  I don't know, Rick.  Thank you, John.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Fish.  Fish, what's going on?  Yeah, what's it doing?  How we doing?  All right.  Yeah, I'm asking a question.  Yeah.  How are we supposed to know if it's Erin?  Well, we got to make sure you guys, you know, know it's Erin.  Because there are people out there that look like other people.  And God forbid there's someone else that looks like Erin.  Right. 
[00:30:30]  And me and my partner Tom go out there and we, like, wind up taking off the wrong pants.  Well, you would be in an awful lot of trouble.  Well, you know, I'm glad you brought that up, Fish.  Yeah, go about that one for just one second.  Erin's going to have to be dressed in a way where there's no doubt in anyone's mind that  that is Erin.  Absolutely.  I see an O&A wow shirt and we would definitely know it's her.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  There's an attorney that wants to give an opinion, Anthony.  All right.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey.  Hey, scum-sucking pig-ass white douchebag.  What can we do for you? 
[00:31:00]  I haven't heard of that before.  Well, that's true.  Basically, the expression I would think that best labels, what you guys are doing, is it's  wrong on so many levels.  Yeah.  You say it's not legal.  I mean, it is legal.  I don't think that public exposure is legal.  There's no public exposure here.  You're ripping her panties off.  I would assume that the idea is for her not to have anything on her to me.  Well, you assumed wrong.  Yes.  Just like the lawyers that work for this company. 
[00:31:30]  You assumed wrong.  I am not going to talk to a lawyer about this.  Because they're going to make me feel guilty, and we're going to back down.  It's the rape game.  The rape game.  Can't we say runaround park for Aaron?  Yeah.  Instead of using that word.  It's an acronym.  It just makes it easier to say.  An acronym.  Instead of saying the World Wrestling Federation every time, you say, you know, WWF.  Rick, always over the top.  I ain't reading that, Rick.  Oh, my God.  Sick F.  Runaround park for Aaron.  Yes, Anthony. 
[00:32:00]  No one's going to get hurt, and there will be no sex.  TJ.  Yeah, we could call it rape war.  Huh?  It'll be running around park for Aaron on roofies.  Get her on roofies.  It'll be a little more easier to identifiable.  Realistic to collect, baby.  See what happens now.  Now it just snowballs.  Aaron will have protection.  Aaron will have protection to make sure she does not get hurt.  Oh, boy.  We have a girl who wants to do this. 
[00:32:30]  She'll be in the park.  At 3 o'clock, we say go.  First person to find Aaron and take the panties off her body wins the trip to WrestleMania in Houston for two.  Ann, what's wrong?  Can we punch her?  No.  Is there any punching?  No, there's no.  Because that takes half the fun out of it right there.  I want to lay a few into the rib cage. 
[00:33:00]  No.  Can I take her to my hotel room?  No, none of that.  I wouldn't be taking her.  She would go there willingly.  Willingly.  We will make sure that nothing happens to Aaron.  Because they all come to my hotel room totally willing.  I never even take them.  I'm laying down trying to catch some sleep.  And they're knocking on the door and saying, hello, Mike Tyson?  And I say, yes.  And they go, can you rape me?  And I say, well, sure.  Who am I to say no? 
[00:33:30]  So I'm into this.  Central Park.  And when is this going to be?  Hopefully next week.  Next week?  Yeah.  If I'm not incarcerated, I will do it.  All right.  And I'm on the Zoloft, so I'm going to go off it.  Because I want to win this.  I take it to keep on killing all of you.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, what's going on?  Yeah, you guys are, your rape acronym should be Risking Arrest, Penetrating Aaron. 
[00:34:00]  No one's penetrating anybody.  None of that will be going on.  It's a very simple contest.  You guys are freaking out on us.  What's wrong?  Race around Park for Aaron for the trip to WrestleMania.  You pull the panties off, Aaron.  Mm-hmm.  And you win the trip.  First person to do it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's kind of an uneasy feeling about this one. 
[00:34:30]  Rich, what's going on?  Hey, Opie.  Four words, man.  Big joke.  Attack, man.  Somebody's going to get in trouble.  The girl is not going to get attacked.  You guys are using your minds too much.  Somebody just looking at her in the park don't know that.  We're going to have security with her.  And there's going to be no sex.  And she will not get hurt.  I got another contest idea.  Oh.  Rectal and peach eating contest.  Thank you.  And I was black or blacker for the future. 
[00:35:00]  Let me tell you something.  This goes horribly bad, guys.  Horribly, horribly bad.  I know I'm blacker for the future.  I'm still here.  Where are you guys?  I'm looking around in the future.  No, no.  I don't see you.  Where are you?  Tony, what's going on?  What up, boys?  Hey.  I back it up 100%.  Yeah?  Why not?  You put a pair of Speedos underneath,  over the panties.  Under the panties.  Why not?  Dude, and after what McMahon pulled in the ring last night 
[00:35:30]  with Trish Stratus,  even he wouldn't object to this one.  Yeah, maybe we should get a WWF representative to see.  Dude, she was like almost butt naked last night.  See if they're into this contest.  Dude, I'm in.  I'll do it.  Freak that.  Because there's a lot of people that want to go to WrestleMania.  Well, bro, you put like a flag on her.  You grab the flag off her back,  and then she hands over the panties.  We're going to have detailed rules.  Aaron will not get hurt.  Okay, and look at the hurt.  There will be no sex.  We will have bodyguards with Aaron.  Dude, I'm in.  I back it up 100%. 
[00:36:00]  It's going to be kind of like our version of the Running Man.  Aaron's going to be set loose a good half hour to 40 minutes beforehand,  and then we're going to give the word,  and then anyone who wants to try to win the trip to WrestleMania  has to find Aaron in the park and pull the panties off of Aaron.  One more thing, boys.  I bet you Anthony would back it up if it was Farney Olsen twins.  Well, yeah.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  Later, boys.  Lisa has a little problem with this.  I was waiting for a lady to call.  Who doesn't?  Lisa, what's up?  Hi, Lisa.  You guys.  Yeah?  Come on.  What? 
[00:36:30]  This is so gross, even for you two.  Yeah, I agree.  You're encouraging a bunch of idiots to run around New York City and attack women.  Not New York City.  All right, the park.  No, and not attack women.  No.  All right.  She's going to willingly stand there, and they just pull her panties down.  They're going to have to...  No, she's going to be able to run.  She's going to be able to...  She's going to be able to...  She's going to rip her panties off.  Uh-huh.  Take the panties off of Aaron.  Okay.  So they're going to tackle her and rip her panties off?  No.  Now you're thinking too much.  You're thinking too much.  There's a way to do... 
[00:37:00]  Let me tell you guys something.  You're not using your minds.  There's a way to do this where the girl will not get hurt.  There will be no sex.  I don't think that I'm the one that's not using my mind in this situation.  You know, I think...  And you know what?  Also, I will go on record and say this girl, Aaron, will enjoy the whole contest.  Right.  But there's a difference between fantasy, like fantasizing about something, and actually  acting it out in the cold in Central Park with a bunch of strangers.  You ladies are always complaining we never do anything for you.  There you go.  It's a bunch of guys on from, you know, Brooklyn that are going to be doing it. 
[00:37:30]  No, no.  Now you...  Guys, just be careful.  You should be concerned about this.  This is...  Thank you.  You know what?  You know what?  And I want to give Aaron some incentive.  For every hour that she survives out there in Central Park, we throw in more money.  Oh, that's good.  So now she's got to run for her life.  Now she...  Yeah, she is completely able to run away from her...  Right.  ...fantasy attackers.  I'm thinking for every hour she survives, she wins, I don't know, like 200 bucks or so.  I like it.  That gives incentive for her to hide and run? 
[00:38:00]  I'm horrified, but I'm kind of drawn to it.  Stephanie, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I'd like to up the end.  Yeah.  If you say that there's other women with these rape fantasies, why don't you have these other  women be part of it?  No, we got to...  No, see, we got to keep it to one girl.  We got to...  Why?  Having around maybe, I don't know, even 10 running around there would be more exciting.  No, 10 running around.  More variety.  It's been done already.  It was called the Puerto Rican Day Parade.  But you have all these people like a teen voyeur bus and this and that. 
[00:38:30]  You know, why don't you have, you know, something else in Central Park?  No, look, don't confuse the issue.  I would love it.  That's our next game called Wilding.  Thank you, Stephanie.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  No, you guys are freaking out.  We got to stick to the basics and it's a contest that we can do.  Yes.  Okay?  No one's going to get hurt.  No one's having any sex.  You find Aaron in the park. 
[00:39:00]  You run around the park and find Aaron.  And then you rip the panties from her.  Right.  And you win.  Aaron, on the other hand, has to evade any of her attackers any way she can.  No, don't even call the attackers.  Contestants, Opie.  Contestants.  She has to.  Because that's what's freaking everyone out.  There's no attackers.  There's no victim.  Evade.  It's a contest for a WrestleMania trip.  Evade the contestants. 
[00:39:30]  Evade the contestants.  And every hour she evades a contestant.  Shut up.  I'm a professional.  I know how to get this by the lawyers.  You can't say attack or victim.  You can say evade.  Evade the contestant.  The contestant.  She wins bigger prizes.  Right.  So, ultimately, it is like a big game of tag, where she is it, and remember when you played  tag, and the little kids would come out, and you'd have to tag the person. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  Oh, then it's harmless.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  Why is everyone freaking?  Don, what's going on?  Hey, listen, man.  I got two things.  First of all, you're telling the gals that you finally have a contest for them, but you  call it rape.  I love your logic there.  No, wait, wait, wait.  It's called R-A-P-E.  Go ahead.  Say it any way you like.  Run around park for Erin.  Okay.  Second thing.  Erin is the prize.  You find Erin and take the panties off her. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, you can set it up like playing football, so she's got them hanging from her belt or  something.  Well, uh...  But the other thing is, when have you guys ever done anything that didn't get out of  control?  Oh, God, I know.  See, that's the only problem I have, O.B.  That's the kicker right there.  Because you guys always ruin it.  You guys ruin it for us.  That's right.  We ruin it.  We bring you fun games, and you take it too far.  Oh, man.  All right, Tom.  I wish you luck with this one, guys.  Thank you.  Take care.  Should we call the press? 
[00:41:00]  I'm pretty excited about our latest...  Oh, no.  Can we please keep this buried?  No, Rick.  Cody, what's going on?  Yeah, you guys are F-tards.  Why?  I got my top ten list of bad ideas, and a game called Rape is number one.  Number one?  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Another lawyer trying to tell us no.  Ivan, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Erin is going to have to sign a huge indemnity clause or a waiver of liability.  Oh, listen to this lawyer babble. 
[00:41:30]  Goodbye, lawyer.  They're...  They could ruin everything.  Shane?  Shahan.  Shahan.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  From Boston, huh?  From Boston, yeah.  All right.  I was listening to you guys up to a few years ago, and then I didn't know you guys were back  on the air.  I'm on board with most of the stuff you guys do.  I would like to point your memories to April Fool's a couple years ago.  I don't think I have to mention the incidents.  I'm just saying, if we're looking for some kind of meter stick like Louis Black to say, 
[00:42:00]  you know, is this okay or not?  I think this is a little more hardcore.  You guys are using your imagination.  Wait.  The problem is, though, I want to see it happen.  I love when you use your imagination, but you've got to calm the F down, everyone.  It's a very simple contest.  No, but see, that's the thing, is I want to see it happen.  I don't want to see anybody get hurt.  The mayor thing is totally different than this.  The mayor thing was some horrible event that we said happened, but it wasn't really as  bad as...  Oh, wait a minute. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  Shahan, thank you.  No problem, guys.  Bye.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  All right.  Basically, what this is like, bodyguards, no bodyguards.  You're sending a girl out there with guys, that's like hanging warm meat from her panties  and then they've got a bunch of pit bulls.  I give our listeners more credit.  I couldn't even say it.  I couldn't even say it.  I don't know. 
[00:43:00]  What happened?  What happened?  You just thought I would be listening.  All right.  Thank you, John.  What did I miss?  I kind of spit out this.  What did I miss, though?  I couldn't even say I give our listeners more credit without laughing.  The water's filling out of Rick's nose.  Hey, Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Now, usually, like, I like everything you do.  Yeah.  But just listen to the name, Rape. 
[00:43:30]  Well, no, it's called Run Around Park for Errant.  You'd call it that, but I think we all know it's called Rape.  Oh, God.  It's like, it's, you know, the rape game.  Remember that song, The Name Game?  Honestly, I do hope this goes down, though, because this will be great.  All right.  Thank you.  I'll catch you guys later.  Where's our supporters?  The people that aren't supporting us, they don't understand the concept of this very simple game.  I know. 
[00:44:00]  Go over.  Maybe they didn't hear me.  Go over everything.  Okay.  The lovely Aaron.  This is called Run Around the Park for Erin, right?  And Erin will be in Central Park.  We'll put her somewhere in the park.  She will be readily identifiable as Erin.  Believe me, you will have a description.  It'll be very obvious.  We'll make her dress completely in pink, something.  You will know who it is.  There will be no mistaking.  Anyway, you will have to run up to her and catch her, because her incentive is to run. 
[00:44:30]  Run.  Run for prizes, Opie.  Right.  The longer she evades...  Kind of like Running Man.  The longer she evades the contestants, the more prizes she gets.  Like Running Man.  Right.  Like a game of tag.  And then when you finally do catch her, you take her panties.  You tear her panties from her.  Maybe that's the part that's... 
[00:45:00]  That seems to be getting bigger.  Maybe that's the part that's freaking everyone out.  And you are the winner of this contest.  And you'll win the trip to WrestleMania in Houston.  Right.  What's the problem?  It's a game of tag.  And Erin will be let...  You know, she will leave the station a good half hour to 40 minutes ahead of everyone.  It's like capture the panties.  And anyone can be involved in this contest.  Anyone plays.  You don't have to sign up to be a contestant.  You just know that on that given day, we are putting Erin in the park. 
[00:45:30]  And you have to find her.  And when you find her, you will run after her and catch her.  And tear the panties from her.  And you will be the winner.  Look, see, now people are making it worse.  Can we smash her head with a brick?  No.  No.  No.  Erin will be well protected by bodyguards and people that can run as fast as...  I envision a park full of women running for their lives. 
[00:46:00]  Alex, what's up?  You guys are sick Fs, man.  What?  But let me ask you something.  How do you verify that it's her panties?  And how much can we do to get them off her?  Shut up.  Sicko.  You guys don't get it.  I'm very disappointed in our audience today.  I know.  I'm very disappointed.  You guys have sick minds.  Sick, sick, sick, sick minds.  Can we hear from the ladies?  Let me go to Al. 
[00:46:30]  Al, what's up?  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  You guys, bro.  Hey, you guys, I don't think it's called rape until the girl called stop.  Oh, my God.  See, no, no.  This is what we did.  Ron, you guys are going to wreck our contest.  It's a very simple concept.  Mike, what's up?  All right, here you go.  Hey.  You could give her some of those giant-sized pregnant lady panties and then give her a stun gun.  No, no stun gun.  There's nothing.  She will not need a stun gun.  It's not rape.  Rape is committing a sexual act without her consent. 
[00:47:00]  If she gives, like, her consent to this whole thing and there's no, there's not even any  sexual act.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to hang up on my, there's going to be no sex.  Erin's not going to get hurt.  No one's going to get hurt.  You know what I like even better?  The game is simple.  You're basically running around the park looking for this girl, Erin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hence, run around park for Erin.  Rick.  Rick, you're enjoying this way too much, man.  You scare me.  Calm down. 
[00:47:30]  Tom, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Listen, I just want to wish you both a fond farewell and wonder what market you'll be playing  in.  Anthony, come in.  One other thing, guys.  Yeah.  I belong to this lodge, you know, and there's like 200 of us, Teaneck Moose Lodge, and we're  going to get a pool.  How many indictments do you think would be the top?  Thank you, Tom.  Look, it's a fun game of tag.  Oh, I capture the flag.  That's all it is. 
[00:48:00]  Only it's the panties.  Eli.  Hey, guys.  I think the acronym actually stands for Radio A-Holes Pursue Employment.  All right.  Thank you.  I think your main problem is it's going to be on public property.  You've got to find private property somewhere so Giuliani can make his last stand on this  issue.  This isn't a...  It's a fun little game of tag in Central Park.  How is that elite?  Yeah.  All right.  And we've got to take a break.  The phones are exploding.  I don't know.  We do want to hear from the ladies.  Oscar, you stay there. 
[00:48:30]  Everyone stay on hold if you're waiting to talk to us, okay?  It's like reality programming.  Yeah.  We should do this before Mark Burnett gets a hold of...  Exactly.  ...a hold of this idea.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  It's the O&A Show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, what happened?  I thought we were all just having fun.  I thought we were having fun, too.  Ouch.  Well, things have drastically changed in the...  The last time we talked to you.  In the short time that it takes to run a few commercials.  We've gotten a couple of phone calls.  Well, it's like someone around here pulled on us and called our boss, who's in another city today. 
[00:49:30]  Well, he's on hold.  Maybe he just wants to play.  Seems like a lot of people have a problem with our new contest called Run Around Park for Erin.  Yeah.  Let's talk to our boss, Ken Stevens.  Uh-oh.  Ken Stevens.  Hello.  Hi there, boss.  How are you?  Thank you for that great introduction, by the way.  Oh, no problem.  Now, you're in Washington.  How did you find out about our new contest? 
[00:50:00]  We want to find out who the weasel is around here.  That would be the assistant program director.  I hope he was right.  That's Mr. Weasel.  He's an officially authorized weasel.  That's his job.  Now, what did you think when he called you up and told you...  Well, let's even back up.  How did he explain it to you?  Pretty much what you just said.  It was a contest involving running around the park and trying to track down this woman with a fantasy. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  All right.  We did say that.  A little vague.  Yeah.  It's a little vague.  I don't think he got all the details out.  Close enough.  We got a...  We don't think that requires a lot of details.  Well, it's like anything else.  Like a scavenger hunt.  Yeah.  Like Tag.  A game of Tag.  You ever play Capture the Flag?  Right.  Something like that.  Only the girl in the park has the flag, if you will. 
[00:51:00]  Whatever we use to...  For a flag is...  Hey, we're going to use panties.  And the contestants go out in the park.  It's not buying it.  They find the girl and remove the panties from her.  And the winner will win the trip to Houston, to WrestleMania.  And as long as this Erin girl can evade the contestants, she wins more prizes by the hour. 
[00:51:30]  The longer she could evade this.  It's sort of like reality programming.  This is our version of Running Man.  Like Running Man or something, right?  No.  Okay.  Ken, what's the prize?  It's like growing up.  I'm trying to think of a way to explain the obvious to you.  Okay.  Which would be...  What if her fantasy was being murdered in the park?  Well, then we would try to find an acronym for kill. 
[00:52:00]  That's what I thought, right?  I'm not sure that there's a difference.  Not a big difference, anyway.  Well, it's just a game of Tag.  No.  What if we just called the game Run Around Park for Erin?  Right.  Because that's all it is.  There's no sex.  Erin won't be injured.  There's nothing sexual about this.  Nothing sexual about the game.  She'll have bodyguards just to make sure.  It's a contest of anger, Opie.  There's nothing sexual about it.  Right.  All she has to do is kind of go about her day in the park. 
[00:52:30]  And our listeners have to find her.  And they remove the panties that will be hanging from her body.  See?  Ah, we finally put that one out there.  Hanging from her body.  The panties will be on the outside, hanging, much like flag football.  We've all played tag football.  Right?  And the first person that gets the panties wins the trip to WrestleMania.  And from now on, we'll just call it Run Around Park for Erin.  Do you want to check with the lawyers? 
[00:53:00]  No.  There is a strategy involved here.  I think it's a fun game.  Melissa up for this, maybe?  Ken?  Oh, you're in it.  Did you hear that painful?  You've lost your mind.  What is wrong?  It's not a contest.  It reminds me of, I wasn't there, but it had to be much like the day in Boston when somebody said,  Hey, I got a good idea.  Well.  It turned out to be a great idea.  Well, Ken, I think I got you here. 
[00:53:30]  I think something with the name of this contest is really what's getting Ken.  Sure.  But that and the whole idea.  Really?  Because if we just approach this as it being a simple game of capture the flag,  what if we put Stinky out in Central Park?  Work with me here.  We have a flag off of his belt.  Yeah.  You have to find Stinky and grab the flag off of his belt, and you win a prize.  Okay.  Is that acceptable? 
[00:54:00]  Sure.  That's a whole different thing.  Okay, now what if we replace Stinky with a girl?  Name her.  Same thing.  Now, it's the same thing.  We replace Stinky with a girl.  Same rules.  You have to take the flag from our belt.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  See, now we're up to that point.  Now, instead of a flag, it's a pair of panties.  Is that still okay?  Now I'm starting to have a problem.  But why?  Because there's a...  What if it's like grandma panties?  Yeah.  Those big boomers.  Those big unsexual.  Nothing sexual about them. 
[00:54:30]  Because there is nothing funny.  It's just that O&A twist.  There is nothing funny about that.  About the O&A show.  Pardon me?  Right?  No, there's nothing funny about that.  We understand that.  That's what we're saying.  We've made a point of saying that.  There's nothing funny about that subject matter that was brought up earlier, Mr. Stevens.  We never said that was funny.  We never did.  But this is a kind of a taking the reality programming to the limits that everyone talks 
[00:55:00]  about at the water coolers.  Very good.  You ever hear that?  People go, oh, well, they have Survivor.  They have this one.  Why don't they do this?  Or why don't they have a show where you really got to be a Survivor?  Why don't they...  We're just bringing it to that level to just show people how insane this reality programming  is.  Stevens, comment?  That's good, but no.  We do work for CBS.  They're on the cutting edge of reality show.  Reality programming.  Mark Burnett's going to get a hold of this one, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So everything was okay, Opie, up until the panty thing.  All right. 
[00:55:30]  Then maybe we can work out the panty thing.  It's still called Runaround Park for Erin.  How about we hang a frying pan and some golf tees.  That's a bad name.  Frying pan and golf tees on her belt.  Panties.  And they got to grab her panties.  Why don't we go back to the stinky idea?  Because stinky's not hot.  We...  Hmm.  Opie, I'm really trying.  I don't see I'm getting through to this guy. 
[00:56:00]  Where could the problem be, is what I'm thinking?  Because, Opie, there's nothing funny.  It's not a sexual conversation.  That's right, Anthony.  That's exactly right.  It's a game of capture the flag.  It's not...  Let's go back to the capture the flag.  In fact, call it capture the flag.  Capture the flag.  Capture the...  C-T-F.  Flags.  No.  No.  Capture...  Capture...  Ultimate...  No.  No?  No.  Okay. 
[00:56:30]  I was trying.  Capture...  Underwear.  No.  No?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  How about we use Black Earl and call it the Underground Railroad game?  You waddle doodle, boss.  Oh, I'm trying here.  God.  Ass nuts.  Let me think.  Who haven't you offended yet?  I dare Anthony to just say, F you, we're doing it, and hang up. 
[00:57:00]  No, I won't do that.  The listeners are all for this.  They're very excited.  Not the ones that really like you.  Not in that way.  They're not...  We promise no anal on your couch.  How about that?  Is this being taped?  I hear a new da-da-da song.  Run around park for Aaron.  That's what we'll call it. 
[00:57:30]  What was it?  Run around park for Aaron.  We won't even say the word anymore.  The bad word that isn't fun.  We know that.  We know that's not fun.  Ken, comment.  Now, let's go back to the capture the flag.  Capture the flag.  How about capture the flag?  We put the game on.  There's a group you forgot.  There you go.  That's right. 
[00:58:00]  No, we understand that.  There's a group you forgot to offend.  I'm trying here.  Okay, capture the flag.  Everything's good until we get to the panties part.  Capture the tampon.  No.  The panties.  It's just panties.  What if Stinky had panties from his belt?  Is that okay?  We put Stinky out there.  Stinky runs around.  And a guy has to grab the panties off of Stinky's belt. 
[00:58:30]  Would that be okay?  Those really big grandmother kind?  Yeah.  And what's the name of this contest?  It's just capture the panties.  C-A-P?  Capture the panties.  Oh, that'd be capture.  C-C-T-P.  But maybe we don't need an acronym.  But would that be passable?  Yeah, I think we're getting there now.  All right, that would.  You sexist bastards.  We can do it with a guy, but the girls aren't allowed to have any fun on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, my God, Ken.  Well, you suggested it.  I was leading you into my trap.  Worked perfectly.  Mwah-ha-ha-ha.  It was brilliant.  Thank you, Opie.  As brilliant as panties.  Panties, panties is great.  Give me a break.  Capture the balloon knot, Ken.  Comment.  Capture the what?  Where are you today?  I'm in Washington. 
[00:59:30]  Washington.  Very important business.  He's in Washington.  Meeting with the president.  Oh, boy.  Now we're going to have to have a meeting about this.  I don't really see it getting solved right now.  Hmm.  All right, we'll, uh...  No, we can solve it now.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  You were getting there.  You had a great idea.  That's something like, like, I don't know, like PLJ would play.  Capture the flag.  Who cares?  Capture the flag.  Well, I was just going along with your idea.  It's run around the park for Aaron.  That's it.  Nothing sexual about it. 
[01:00:00]  Nothing whatsoever.  No, that's, that's just, that's bad.  That's very bad.  Find underwear in Central Park.  No, no.  No, that doesn't quite work.  That's not how you spell that.  I understand, O.C.  I'm not very good at spelling.  Or diplomacy, for that matter. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, my God.  Hmm.  Well, we better let Ken go for now.  How about a bra?  Hanging off the belt.  A little less sexual than panties.  Off a stinky's belt?  No, stinky's out of the picture.  That was my clever ruse, Ken.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We've got to use a girl for this.  Hmm.  No, I don't see that working out.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh.  This is going to be our big spring promotion. 
[01:01:00]  Oh.  You'll have no problem with the game.  I have no problem with the game.  Say it, Ken.  I have a big problem with that game.  Jedi Mindtrap.  These are not the radio hosts you're looking for.  No?  It's not working?  I've got to work on that.  How come the Jedi Mindtrap works everywhere else but you?  All right.  We better let Ken go.  Ken, very busy in Washington.  All right, Ken.  We'll try to work this out. 
[01:01:30]  All right, well, you'll let me know before you come up with a new acronym, right?  Yeah, we don't have to let you know.  No, but I'd appreciate it.  We don't have to let you know.  Please?  You can't hear me right now?  Yeah, yeah, what?  Come on, so I'll freak him out.  Well, the contest starts and...  Did he hang up?  Hello?  He hung up.  Oh. 
[01:02:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Didn't even get to say goodbye.  Oh.  It's never good when he hangs up on us.  All right, so this is going to happen, what, next Wednesday?  Next Wednesday.  Run around the park for Aaron.  Looking forward to it.  What happened? 
[01:02:30]  We were all starting to get along again.  All right.  Uh, Laura, what's going on?  Opie, Anthony.  Yes, yes.  You guys are crazy.  You know exactly what type of guys are going to show up to this.  Guys that want to go to, uh, Wrestlemania?  Wrestlemania.  Yeah, and what kind of guys are those?  A bunch of toothless, drunken, white trash a-holes with white beater t-shirts on.  That's exactly what's going to come.  And what is, and most of the people that come to the park are, you guys are nuts. 
[01:03:00]  You know exactly what's going to go on.  Why do you think you need bodyguards?  Hey, I'm, I'm, uh, I'm insulted.  I think the listeners ruined this contest.  No, no, no.  By freaking out.  No.  See?  I've been a loyal listener to you guys since you've been on in New York,  and I love everything you guys do, but we all know what the underlying thing is that's  going on here.  Yeah.  That the, that you want it.  Well, tell you the truth.  I mean, it sounds funny and all, but.  No, it doesn't.  All right.  It's a contest.  Thank you.  Ah, come on.  All right.  I'm going to let Laura go. 
[01:03:30]  Ah, Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  I just wanted to say that I think it's a pretty good idea.  You know, it shows you guys got some balls.  And, um, it's real, too, way too easy to push buttons.  So that's what makes it more fun.  Don't you think?  All right.  Easy to push buttons.  You know, you're next.  The listeners make it, the listeners make it worse.  That's not nice.  Let's go to Oscar.  Oscar, what's going on?  Guys, I don't know what Ken's problem is here.  This is the cutting edge of reality radio. 
[01:04:00]  Mark Burnett is going to jump on this.  Yeah, Mark Burnett's going to grab this idea.  I'm telling you.  Within a year, it's going to be on HBO, not on regular TV, on HBO, because it's so far ahead.  It's going to be right after Oz.  All right.  Thank you, Oscar.  You got it.  Bye.  All right.  Krista, what's going on?  I think that if you let girls do it, then nobody would have as much of a problem. 
[01:04:30]  What happened?  I said if you let girls chase around the park.  And tag her underwear, then I don't think they'll have so much of a problem.  Ah.  But the problem is, the winning prize you get for it sucks.  Who the hell likes with WWF?  I don't know.  Well, there are plenty of people that do.  Females?  Not too many.  Now, you see them out there.  Yeah.  Sure.  I'm not one of them.  They love The Rock.  Thank you, Krista.  Thank you.  I figured out the K word, by the way. 
[01:05:00]  What?  Ken.  Ken.  Ken.  Right.  So what's the Central Park find underwear in Central Park?  For Ken.  For Ken.  Ken.  All right.  We better take a break, because I'm sure he's going to be calling back. 
[01:05:30]  All right.  That went well.  I think it did.  Have you ever seen the people that listen to this show?  Opie and Anthony.  Toothless, drunken, white trash.  Hi, Dr. Oates.  One, two, seven, three, many, many, many.  Hey, this is John Velby.  They call me Dr. Dirty, because I'm a f***ing a*****.  But you're still listening to Opie and Anthony on 102.7 N.E.W.  Yeah.  Thank you, John.  The O&A Show, 212-757-1027 is our phone number. 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  Everyone is outraged over our latest idea for a contest.  It was a very simple contest that had nothing to do with sex.  I thought the boss would be proud.  We were doing something that had nothing to do with sex.  Right.  It was a simple game of capture the flag.  Run around park for Aaron.  And people are outraged.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Just want to make it perfectly clear, because we're getting phone calls from news organizations now. 
[01:06:30]  There's nothing sexual about the contest.  Oh, please.  Weren't you listening?  They want to know if we can guarantee the safety of the girl.  Nothing was going to happen to the girl.  Nothing whatsoever.  Simple game, just like I said.  It would have been the same thing if we put a stinky out there with a flag on his belt.  The same concept.  Same concept as flag football.  And everyone is outraged, because we're calling the game run around park for Aaron. 
[01:07:00]  Please.  And the boss just hung up on us.  He's never done that before.  A little angry, I guess.  Well, you know, that's his job, Opie.  All right, we should move on to other things, I guess.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I just wanted to make a point.  I think everybody, I'm all for the contest.  I just think everybody's going crazy, you know, because of the initials.  It's rape.  But, Anthony, you were talking about your mom used to eat AIDS bars or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, so, I mean, they didn't try to ban and stop selling the AIDS bars. 
[01:07:30]  The AIDS diet plan.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what I mean?  This is the rape game.  It's just like capture the flag, you know?  I don't think it's that big of a deal, but I'm all for it.  All right, Andy.  All right.  There you go.  And this all came about because of some of the conversations we had on the radio yesterday  with the ladies.  Sick.  Yeah, we were like...  Girls are into...  The few girls I called yesterday were into these rape fantasies, which I just can't fathom.  Amazing.  But they were into them.  I don't know. 
[01:08:00]  It was inspiring.  Hey, Keith, what's going on?  Hey, Owen, hey.  How you guys doing, man?  Good.  Listen, I'm all in for it.  I think it's a good idea.  I don't see anything wrong with it.  I just want to tell you guys, don't buckle down to any of these scumbag lawyers or douchebag  feminists that call in.  Of course, if there was a guy out there in a park, you wouldn't get one phone call.  Right.  You would not get one phone call.  Everybody would say it's a great idea.  Listen, there's two consenting adults doing what they want to do.  There's nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing against the law.  No, there was going to be an invader and many contestants. 
[01:08:30]  Okay.  So, I mean, you know, you've got two consenting adults.  There's nothing wrong with it.  So, you know, don't buckle down, man.  Good idea.  Go for it.  Well, when Ken hangs up on you, that's...  Who?  Don't worry about that, man.  Yeah, Ken's our big boss.  When he hangs up, it usually gets ugly after that.  No, listen, man.  It's a good idea.  I like the name.  Go with it.  All right.  Thank you.  This guy's stuck.  Thank you.  Later.  All right.  Moving right along, Anthony.  Yes. 
[01:09:00]  What about money, Ken, is flying up from Washington as we speak?  He's on a plane right now.  I wouldn't doubt it.  All right.  A little distracted now.  Oh, it happens.  All right, Anthony, what's going on with Napster?  Well, last I heard, the guy that runs Napster has three days.  Yeah, check this out.  This is insane.  Three days to filter out the names of songs that are given to him by the record company. 
[01:09:30]  So he's got 72 hours.  The record companies all get together.  They hand this guy a list of the names of all those copywritten songs they want filtered  from Napster, so you won't be able to download them.  Not only the actual names, but any misspellings of the names of the songs or tricky ways to  do it.  Like instead of the spelling T-O of two, if you put the number two, it won't show up either. 
[01:10:00]  So this amounts to, I don't know how many songs, but it's got to be millions.  Millions upon millions.  And they have to get this done in 72 hours.  It's as simple as this, too, like Metallica.  Enter the Sandman.  Yeah, if you put Enter Sandman, and you know, it's Enter Sandman.  You can't get it.  But if you put Enter the Sandman, you might have been able to get it. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  But they're going to put that in, too.  Yeah, the record company is going to have all sorts of ways to...  Identify their songs, and they're going to have to remove all these combinations.  To build a database this big in 72 hours, it's impossible.  It ain't gonna happen.  So what does that mean?  If it's not done in 72 hours...  They'll probably shut them down.  The court will just shut the whole thing down?  That's it.  So it looks like Napster, although this has happened in the past, and then all of a sudden they get some kind of injunction.  But it looks pretty bad for the Napsky, Opie, for the Napster. 
[01:11:00]  So we might have to look for another way to find our clever little songs that we play on the air.  I know Steve had a good one.  I'm not telling everybody, though.  I want to check it out myself before it gets bombarded by that.  Yeah, it sucks.  I mean...  And Lars is so responsible for making this a huge issue.  And then you read in the latest issue of Playboy, is it?  The interview with Metallica. 
[01:11:30]  And you really get an understanding of how big an a-hole Lars is.  And how hated him and even James is.  Well, they're all a-holes in the band.  They all hate each other, according to the latest issue of Playboy.  They're all fighting with each other.  Yeah, well, Jason's out.  It's turning out that the reason Jason left Metallica is because James Hetfield would not allow him to release his solo album.  He's got a bunch of solo stuff. 
[01:12:00]  Anyone in a band has their own solo material, you know?  And he wanted to put out an album.  And the other guys in Metallica are like, what?  No.  And James is really adamant about this.  Saying, oh, well, where does it end?  He puts an album out and it sells.  And then what?  He tours the album?  It's like, he's like, this is like a marriage.  You're married to the band and you don't just go off and...  What?  For the record, Lars is all for Jason putting out this album, by the way.  Oh, Lars is?  And Kirk is, too. 
[01:12:30]  The only one that's not for it is James.  And Jason's like arguing and saying, man, you know, any chance Hetfield gets, he's on someone else's album.  Supposedly he sings on Corrosion of Conformity's albums.  South Park.  And the South Park thing, thank you for the movie.  They're all effed up, those guys.  Well, they've been at it for like 20 years.  It's a shame, but it might just be a time to pack it in for Metallica. 
[01:13:00]  Lars running around doing goddamn millionaire.  Who wants to be a millionaire?  Lars Ulrich.  From the band Metallica.  Pretty confident about that.  Are you?  Are you?  Hey, Jason, what's up?  You want a Regis tie?  I'll get you one of those Ray Geltman.  Get him a tie, for God's sake.  Sorry about that.  Jason, what's up?  Yeah, I know the music is going to be filtered out, but what about like clips from your show 
[01:13:30]  where like comedians like Brewer and everyone like that?  Filtered out?  I think that's the stuff that'll stay on Napster if Napster survives.  Oh, because that's the only stuff I download anyway.  All you're going to get is, I don't think our record company is putting a list of Opie  and Anthony tracks together to hand over to Napster.  I wouldn't worry about that.  I get it.  And we're not going to be handing over a list of stuff that has been on our show to get off  Napster, so we might be the only thing on Napster after this period goes by.  I think so.  Cool. 
[01:14:00]  All right, Jason.  O and Aster.  What is this Napster clone that may set up shop offshore, Anthony?  Yeah, well, you know, the courts can't regulate the Internet when it's happening outside of  the country.  You know, not this country anyway.  So now some guy's planning on doing like a Napster clone outside of the grasp of America's  legal system.  That's where we get all of our casinos, online gambling, some of the porno. 
[01:14:30]  You know, you just kind of pipe it in.  Go offshore.  Sure.  That's why it's ridiculous when you look at America trying to regulate what we see on  the Internet.  Because you could just move and then, hey, you've got no jurisdiction over me.  And they cannot possibly filter out stuff that's coming in from all over the world.  It just ain't going to happen.  So this will probably pop up, but then they'll charge for it.  Because I don't think you could run a system like that offshore without wanting to make 
[01:15:00]  money.  You might as well do gambling.  I don't mind if they charge.  I just want them to keep the cost down.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, like we said, I'd pay, what, five, ten bucks a month?  Perhaps.  In a second.  Yeah.  In a second.  Pop it on.  Screw it.  Are they going to allow that, though?  No.  Let's go to Dylan.  Dylan.  Dylan.  Dylan.  What's up?  I'm just so disgusted with record companies and the fact that they just want to siphon  money off an existing company.  Like, what do they have to do with the program that Sean Fanning wrote? 
[01:15:30]  Why do they deserve money?  They should just improve their own product.  Well, it's simple.  The record company's saying it's copyright infringement.  Yeah.  But it's just, if they really, like the people that are doing this battle don't know what  it's like to download music.  It's not that easy.  You know?  It's like...  I think we all could agree that it is pretty easy.  Yeah, but it's not...  That's why Napster rocks.  But it's not the same as, like, going to a store and buying an album.  Like, I'm not going to...  Aftards are downloading music through Napster. 
[01:16:00]  I'm not going to, like, go out and...  If there's a band that I really love, I'm not going to download their new album off Napster.  I'm going to go buy it.  And the record companies should have faith that they're still going to sell records.  It's like the same thing when cassettes came out.  They were freaking out.  We've heard all the arguments, Dylan.  It's not happening.  They don't want to listen to any of that.  It's over, Johnny.  They just want...  Yeah, they just want money.  I'm a musician.  I'm just liking stuff that it shows that they really...  They just want a piece of the action.  They have no regard for artists at all. 
[01:16:30]  All right, Dylan.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Steve, comments about Napster?  Well, I think the record companies, I don't think they care if 1% of the population is downloading free music  and free anything off of the Internet.  I think it's when a significant portion, i.e. 70 million people, are downloading free stuff  with a program that's as easy to use as Napster that it becomes a significant problem.  But they have said that record sales haven't gone down.  Single sales.  For all those.  Single...  Record sales have been declining as at the normal rate that they have every year. 
[01:17:00]  Well, that's because they keep raising the prices.  That and there's not a lot of great music coming out.  Not really.  Not really.  Yeah.  It's so expensive to put an album out.  But the other side of the argument is, why shouldn't an artist be compensated for his work?  And that's...  And why are there so many people that feel that they're entitled to free stuff?  Well, Steve, what I was trying to get at, because we've all had the arguments.  We've heard all this crap over and over again. 
[01:17:30]  What are we going to do now?  What is going to happen now if they shut down Napster?  There's going to be alternatives.  They're just not going to be as easy.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, you'll have to be a little more of a geek to be able to download it.  And that'll reduce the percentages, and then the record companies will be happy.  Because instead of 90 million people downloading stuff for free, it'll be...  Like 10.  One year.  Or whatever.  How is 3,000 miles to Graceland, Steve?  Fantastic.  Actually, I don't have it yet.  Still downloading?  He actually was in the office before telling me about how he has been downloading maybe 
[01:18:00]  a couple of movies.  Which is fine.  It may be movies.  It's out there.  Current runs.  And then he goes...  And then he goes...  He goes, yeah, later on I'm going to download Chocolat.  Like, I'm just watching the download bar move would be more interesting than the other  movie.  That's true.  Why are you downloading Chocolat?  Actually, I'm not.  I'm not.  Someone offered it to me, and I said, okay, fine.  Yeah.  Let me go to Steven.  Steven has something about the...  Chocolat.  Steven, what's going on? 
[01:18:30]  Hey, how are you doing, guys?  Hey.  I'm a computer programmer.  It easily can be done that they can filter out all the stuff.  In 72 hours?  Easily.  Because as long as the company has given them a list of the information, they already  have a database with all the files on it.  Like, whenever you go and download, they always say it's like this many people in the  database.  Yeah.  As soon as you go in, it automatically adds your information to the database, and automatically  what they can do is say, if you ever look at any of the download on the MP3 files, number  one, they just say, any of these artists automatically filter out. 
[01:19:00]  And then they can say, like, each piece of the names, they filter out the names, and it's  not that difficult to be done.  I don't know.  It seems like a lot of stuff to have to put in to filter.  Oh, yeah.  It'll probably take them the three days, but they could be able to do it, but I'm sure  they're going to say something, oh, it's not enough time, and they'll be able to do  something like you guys say, like an injunction.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's going to be weird popping on Napster and just being able to pull up old folk songs.  Ooh, if I had a hammer. 
[01:19:30]  Wow, this is great stuff.  There's some polka stuff, too.  Yeah, polka.  All right, Stephen, thank you.  Well, done with the public domain.  Didn't Metallica's lawyers say, well, that's great.  Fine.  I'm glad they're finding religion, but if they don't have this under control in a week,  we're still going forward with our suit.  Hey, Vic, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hit us.  Hey, I'm glad to hear some guys on the radio finally saying that Metallica sucks and it's  time to call it quit.  You know, they used to rule, and now they just suck and they've sold out. 
[01:20:00]  It's over.  It's over for now.  Oh, yeah.  It's definitely over.  You know, usually everyone's kissing their ass when they come out with a new album saying  it's so great, but you know what?  They blow.  It's time to quit.  And they've definitely sold out.  You know, what more is it to say?  All right, Vic.  Thank you.  Later on, guys.  Peace.  I mean, what, putting the music in as Pig Lenten?  What is this about?  Are they going to be able to filter that out? 
[01:20:30]  No, there's so many variations on spelling.  They could, like you were saying, you could do fade to black or fade number to black or  Metallica hyphen fade to black.  Wade, Faye, Ute, Ak, Blaine.  And you have fade to black.  Oh, that's great.  If you're just doing it by names, you're not going to be able to filter out.  If people hook up, you'll make your own Napster language that people will be able to figure  out.  The cool thing about the Internet is there's underground communities, and they'll figure  it out, and they'll have a way of, you know, continuing this.  There is a way around it. 
[01:21:00]  Max, what's going on?  Hey, Max.  Max, you there?  Buddy?  Someone's on.  Now, I couldn't go.  I go out and let's say I buy a Metallica album.  I take a song.  I put it to mv3.  I email it to Steve.  Have I done something horrible?  Is that copyright information?  No, but 1,000 people just didn't copy it off of you.  All right.  What's the number, then?  What if, uh...  Well, again, it's percentages.  It's percentages. 
[01:21:30]  Well, what if...  You and I are two people.  Two people out of 100 million people.  That's fine.  Is five people okay?  I guess.  Ten?  What's the number, then, all of a sudden where it becomes a problem?  Let's get on the phone with Sony Music and ask them.  Ask them how many is a problem.  Let's go to Don.  Don, you're next on WNNW.  Yeah, I just wanted to explain the thing with the movies.  There's a thing called DivX Encoding that's out now, which is like MP3 for music, but it's just for movies.  Yeah.  And what you do is you go on IRC.  Just give them an IRC client, which is Internet Relay Chat. 
[01:22:00]  Yes.  Go and find a DivX channel or chat room, and people will hook you up with the newest movies that are out there, even in theaters still.  And, yeah, but you need, like, a cable modem to download something that big, at least a cable modem or DSL.  But, yeah, I mean, IRC is a place where you can still get MP3s after Napster's gone, get movies, games, software, everything.  Hey, where did Steve go?  Hey, Steve, where did you go?  Yes.  Where did Steve go?  Steve?  Thank you, Don.  No problem. 
[01:22:30]  Take it easy.  All right, so that's the latest on Napster.  Not looking good for the boys.  People who are using Napster are not stealing from anyone.  Members are trading files that they already own or bought from record stores.  The record companies charge too much for CDs.  It's ridiculous.  Look what happened to concert tickets.  The prices are so out of hand.  Remember Pearl Jam's protest, the ticket mask.  What does that have to do with it?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:23:00]  It ended their career.  They always do win it in the end, though, the big companies, Opie.  We're just pawns out here.  Little pebbles.  Yeah, we're nothing.  A little tooth in a piece of a tooth of a gear snapped off and fell into the works.  No one would notice.  The machine churns on, Opie.  All right, well, there.  Oh, my God, I want to kill myself now.  Well, geez, I just freaked myself out.  Are you high or something? 
[01:23:30]  That's a conversation you have when you're high.  Hey, Ann, what's up?  Hi, I have a question.  Yes.  My husband had a Whip It Out Wednesday sign on his truck.  Yeah.  Nice.  Well, I said, yeah, that doesn't bother me.  I'm up for it all.  And I said to him, I said, what's that about?  He goes, oh, I don't know.  I didn't do it.  He said, I guess it was just a practical joke.  I said, I don't think O&A would think that was a practical joke.  I think that they would think it was a pleasure.  So I wanted a little clarification. 
[01:24:00]  He's listening.  What are you trying to find out?  You want us to rat out your husband?  No, no.  What do you think wow means?  If you had it for a girl, for a guy, to Whip It Out, I would be thrilled.  Whip It Out.  Hey, Ann, thanks for calling.  Thank you, Ann.  What?  What?  Talk about being high.  By the way, if you want a wow sticker, send your self-addressed stamped envelopes to 888-7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106. 
[01:24:30]  That address on all the websites that you know and love, including WNEW.com, okay?  Right.  We'll be back.  What kind of show is this?  It was like somebody pouring hot wax in your ears until your brain was completely numb.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027-WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  Hour, by O.P. and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027-WNEW. 
[01:25:00]  We are...  212-757-1027 is our phone number, Anthony.  Yeah.  A lot of people outraged today.  Ah, what a nightmare.  I've got to say hi to Jay Moore.  Jay!  Jay.  Gentlemen.  What's up, Jay?  What's happening?  First of all, let me start by saying it has been way too long since we spoke, and I apologize.  What have you been up to?  I've just been doing stand-up, hitting that road.  I was in Tempe, Arizona, and once again, there's people in Arizona in the middle of Death Valley 
[01:25:30]  screaming out, O&A!  Nice.  That makes no sense.  People are vacationing in Tempe, I guess.  That exotic locale.  Cool.  Yes.  Gateway to Tucson.  So what have you been up to, buddy?  Just doing stand-up, trying to get a job like the next guy.  Well, I heard you're going to be in a movie with Denise Richards.  Is that true?  It's supposed to be true, but the strike's coming down in April, so now it's going to  happen after April.  What does that mean now?  It means nobody works during the strike.  I'm no rat.  I don't cross no picket lines. 
[01:26:00]  I ain't no rat.  That means more reality shows for us.  Right.  Even if it's a shot at the bank, Denise Richards, you've got to take a pass.  You can't cross the line.  Oh, man.  That's what I'm hearing.  Everyone's got to, like, you know, not work, so I don't know.  Well, the joke's on them, because I get to go through stand-up, so let these dumb actors  go on strike.  What's their issue this time?  Residuals for cable.  Residuals for cable.  And I kind of understand what they're saying, because I watch, you know, I do the voice  for Beyond the Glory on Fox.  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  And I have the dish, so I have, like, every channel in the world, and that thing's on,  like, 50 times a day.  So if I got residuals on that, forget it.  Yeah, but why didn't you work that into your deal?  Because you don't, it's just not how it goes, the cable.  You get paid a flat fee up front for a show, and that's that.  Jay, you've got to back up.  Beyond the Glory.  I saw it the other night with The Fridge.  Yeah, how about Spaceman Bill Lee?  Bill Lee, that was good, too.  You didn't voice all of them, didn't you just voice The Fridge?  No, I do all of them.  Oh, see, we didn't even recognize your voice until The Fridge won. 
[01:27:00]  I swear to God.  They had Buster Douglas, an amazing story.  Then they had Spaceman Bill Lee, who pitched for the Red Sox and the Expos.  The Red Sox would have won the pennant if Don Zimmer didn't sit him.  Yeah.  They were 14 games up, and he was 12-4 against the Yankees that year.  Another coulda, shoulda, woulda for the Sox.  I know, it's unbelievable.  Well, Bill Lee was an interesting character.  And then the refrigerator, where, God, his life went bad, huh? 
[01:27:30]  No, it's great.  His is the best one.  Because he's not like a bum.  He saved all his money.  And when he was Don, when he ate himself out of football, I love that expression,  then he ate himself out of football.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  He's trapped in football.  He's just surrounded by cheese and crackers.  I gotta get out of football.  I'm gonna eat my way out.  He's still relatively young, isn't he?  He can't be more than 40 years old, right?  No, he's probably about 40, and he's probably about 40,000 freaking pounds.  Yeah, he's over 400 pounds, I hear.  And he just fishes and drinks beer, and he owns a brick company. 
[01:28:00]  A brick company, really?  He lays bricks, but that's what he always did.  Doing the Super Bowl show.  How many good years did he have?  Probably six.  How many good years did the refrigerator have?  Six?  About six.  Yeah, it seemed like he was more than that, you know?  What's Jim McMahon there with you?  I'm here with Jim McMahon.  I was wondering who that was.  I'm here with Richard Kent.  No, that's a good show, though.  I like it.  Thanks, brother.  I like it a lot.  So tell me about this contest everyone's up in arms about.  Ah, where are you calling from?  My home.  In L.A.? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, I rented Cherry Falls.  Uh-huh.  It's so bad, it's hilarious.  I don't even know that movie.  Cherry Falls.  It's a horror movie I did.  Wait, come on.  It was so bad, it didn't get released.  So they just put it right to video.  When did you do that?  I did it like two years ago.  Cherry Falls.  All right, well.  There's a murderer in a town, the town of Cherry Falls, and he's only murdering virgins.  So the kids get together to have an orgy. 
[01:29:00]  And then the killer runs through the orgy just stabbing people.  Sounds like every horror movie.  I got it.  Now I got to get it.  I'm not going to be able to get it.  You know what?  It's showgirls.  It's showgirls bad.  Everyone's going to rent it, though, tonight, and I'm not going to be able to get it.  Showgirls wasn't that bad, though.  No, but, okay.  It's showgirls without any nudity, but it's like that type of bad where you're laughing  because it's funny.  It's fun.  And you're the killer?  Yeah, I'm dressed up like a woman stabbing people at an orgy.  When you plug a movie, it's like showgirls without the nudity.  Yeah, I told you it was bad, but I was laughing my nuts off. 
[01:29:30]  Really?  Yeah, I was like, you know what?  I'll stand behind this one.  This is so bad that it's great.  And you're the murderer?  I'm the teacher.  Oh, you're the teacher?  I'm the one all these little hot little virgins come up and go,  Mr. Marlinson, can I have sex with Timmy?  And I take him in the courtroom and bang him.  Hey, there's a guy in the line that's saying that Cherry Falls is priceless.  Hold on.  It is priceless.  That's what I'm saying.  Hold on.  Let me get Chris on.  Chris, what's going on?  Nothing much, man.  What's happening?  Hey.  The part in Cherry Falls where J. Moore reveals himself to be the killer, 
[01:30:00]  and he's sitting there in a black dress, and he's putting on makeup.  Dude, it's worth the price.  Wait.  You just ruined it.  Trust me.  The movie was ruined as soon as it started.  He ruined it.  He said that Jay's the killer.  You already said it.  Yeah, we already said that Jay was the killer.  Oh, I said, well, are you the killer?  And you said, no, I'm the teacher.  And I'd have been like, oh, okay, I'd have watched it.  People had an orgy.  Yeah, no, Jay said he was the killer.  Anthony, are you at the show right now?  He's a smart ass. 
[01:30:30]  I was trying to keep the suspense there.  I didn't know.  Even if you know everything about it, Chris is right.  It's so bad, it's priceless.  Cool.  It's hilarious.  I'm telling you, the look on Jay's face when he turns around with him, when he's putting  the lipstick on, I'm telling you, you will S yourself.  Completely S yourself.  I see sigpick.  Hey, Chris, how about when I do Otto and George, when they do the cutaway of their little  ventriloquist tummy?  Dude, the movie, I'm telling you, if that comes out on DVD, I am picking it up.  The movie is priceless.  DVD.  Hey, Jay, did it make the movies at all? 
[01:31:00]  No.  No, there's my phone's breaking.  Peace out, Jay.  I love you.  Take care, guys.  All right, Chris.  He showed it on USA TV.  It was on USA?  Yeah, it didn't even, like, get sold to TNT.  It was like USA, right after this old house.  Jay, there's a guy on the line, Ron, who was in the orgy scene.  Stop.  Of Cherry Falls.  Ron.  Hey.  Hey.  Hold on, man.  I hung up.  That guy was full of crap, Jay. 
[01:31:30]  I could just ask them where they filmed it, and they'd all be like, oh, I don't know,  and that's how we can bust them.  Let's see.  Brittany Murphy.  Oh, you're on the Internet already.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Stop looking at your stocks for five seconds.  Internet.  Internet.  Crackhead day trader that Anthony is.  Not anymore.  Oh, come on, dude.  Who'd get into this market at day trade?  Where'd you go to Gamblers Anonymous to get out of the stock market?  No, it just took a hit over a year ago, and it's over, Johnny.  You don't see the stocks moving 15 points either way on a given day. 
[01:32:00]  It's over, Johnny.  Can anybody put baby powder on your shoes?  Those wacky suits.  We had that.  Rocky liked the movie as well.  Rocky.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  Yo, man, I love the movie, and because the reason why is because Brittany Murphy was in it,  and she's like the hottest girl ever.  Who's Brittany Murphy?  She was a little nerdy girl.  She was in Clueless.  She was also the girl that hanged herself in Girl Interrupted. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, okay.  Oh, you ruined that.  What?  Oh, come on.  Oh, jeez.  Give me a break here, man.  I was going to go see that this weekend.  All right.  Well, thank you, Rocky.  Hey, yo, anybody knows I'm all my best, okay?  Keep on rocking.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Did you guys see Girl Interrupted?  No.  You've got to see it, because the entire movie, Angelina Jolie, is like herpes on her lip.  Really?  Like she's got a split lip, like right in the middle of her lip.  Well, those are hard lips to take care of. 
[01:33:00]  She's got those big-ass lips.  No, this is pretty nasty.  They'd be cracking.  What's the contest?  I got the vibe.  All the way out in L.A., people are going, you got a call.  They got some crazy contests.  Well, we have a few print medias calling us now.  We just had an idea for a contest, Jay.  That's all.  It's called Run Around Park for Errand.  Run Around Park for Errand.  Wait a minute.  Errand.  Errand.  E-R-I-N.  Errand.  Oh, so that would be a...  Okay, rape would be the abbreviation for that. 
[01:33:30]  It is?  Oh, wow.  That is, Hopi.  I didn't even notice that.  Let me think.  Run Around Park or Rap for...  Run Around Park for Errand, okay?  There was nothing sexual about the contest.  No one was going to get hurt.  And it was a way to give away a trip to WrestleMania in Houston.  Oh, Houston.  Who doesn't want to go to Houston?  So basically, you want to hear the details?  Please, Hopi.  The big boss called.  He is really pissed.  He hung up on us.  So tomorrow's going to be a very ugly day. 
[01:34:00]  But basically, this girl, Errand, will be in the park with Stinky and some bodyguards.  Just to make sure, okay?  We let her loose about 40 minutes before the contestants, okay?  It's kind of like our version of Running Man.  Then when we give the signal, anyone who wants to go to WrestleMania, they run all over the park trying to find Errand.  Right.  When they find her, the first person that takes the panties off Errand's body wins the trip to Houston for WrestleMania.  Now, does Errand know that the panties being ripped off her body is part of the contest? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  So what's the problem?  Yeah.  Is she going to wear them like around her wrist?  It's like flag football.  Nice.  It's flag football with panties attached to her.  What's Errand look like?  What are we, dimension-wise, what are we talking about?  Because I have a good idea for the sequel contest.  Hold on one second.  We're getting something.  So a lot of people are outraged over that, Jay.  Well, no one's raping her.  No, there's nothing sexual about the contest.  Everyone's going to be fine. 
[01:35:00]  You should have, after this one, the smashing success because everything you guys touched on is gold.  Jay, Jay, don't even say it because we're in a lot of trouble.  Why?  He's going to, go ahead.  All right.  The next one should be, the girl should just be, like, literally 675 pounds because it'd  be so much harder to get the underpants off because there'd be all those, like, folds  and things hanging over the sides.  Thank you.  So, like, once they got her, she could, like, punch them in the face and it'd be like a big  brawl would ensue.  Right.  You can get Star Jones.  Now, Anthony's wanting to...  Tear the panties off of Star Jones in the park. 
[01:35:30]  We better not talk about it anymore.  We're in...  Yeah, well, the boss called and got all pissed off at it for some reason.  I don't understand.  It's just a little game.  There was nothing sexual about the contest.  We're running for me.  I remember the story like this.  What's this?  It was a dark and scary night.  Kind of like the night.  25 years ago.  Ah!  The town of Cherry Falls. 
[01:36:00]  Now.  You haven't heard about Rod and Stacy?  Did they break up?  Wake up!  Wake up!  They're dead!  Come on!  What their parents hid in the past.  Nobody has seen or heard of her for over 25 years.  Mom, did you know I seen that woman named Laura Lee Sherman?  Her death?  No.  Why?  Is her name the present.  Who is it?  Is your mom home?  No.  She didn't tell you I was going to die.  Four teenagers have been killed. 
[01:36:30]  Some have been viciously attacked.  All victims are cared to be virgins.  I need to ask you a personal question.  How far are you going?  Face-wise?  Can you go further?  It looks like it rocks.  I want to see this now.  I swear.  Service, tell me.  We're playing the commercials. 
[01:37:00]  The trailer rocks.  Where did you try to install the trailer?  Oh, there's Jay.  It just showed you.  You better come.  Come on.  This is my pulse.  I can't just flip.  Oh, that's over the head.  That's right, baby.  Don't mess around.  Something romantic.  I can't just split.  Goddamn.  That looks good.  I got to see that now.  I can't just split.  And then I split his melon open with an axe.  Split his head open with an axe.  There you have it.  Cherry Falls. 
[01:37:30]  Starring Jay Moore.  He's quiet.  If that would have come out before Scream, my God.  I'm hearing it's going to be available on DVD next week.  How funny is that?  That that movie's really corny.  There's going to be like a run on it tonight.  Oh, forget about it.  We're going to go to Blockbuster now and get it.  There's a scene.  There's a fight scene in like the secret laboratory towards the end of the movie.  Secret laboratory.  Yeah.  Hey, Heyman.  That's awesome.  It's really.  Me and my wife watched it last night. 
[01:38:00]  We were just laughing our asses off.  And then in that fight scene, I looked at Nicole and I said, you know, that is actually  a great two minutes right there.  A great two minutes.  It was like a bunch of fighting, getting stabbed in the leg and like just blood spraying  all over everybody.  That's funny.  Everybody's jugs and are out, you know.  Nice if you grow tough.  All right, Jay.  You guys are the best.  We got to take a break.  I just wanted to check in because it's been too long and I just wanted to show the respect 
[01:38:30]  to you guys.  When are you going to be in New York, man?  I'm going to Paris.  The French love action.  Who knew?  Paris.  Paris to promote action.  Are you kidding?  That's cool.  I got four first class tickets out of them, too.  J'ai mill.  Voici, je m'appelle Jay Moore.  Tu veux mon programme d'action.  I'm speaking French now.  Call us from Paris.  I'll do that.  All right.  It's eight hours ahead, so I'll call you at about six in the morning.  All right, Jay.  Take care, guys. 
[01:39:00]  God bless you.  Thank you.  Jay Moore.  It's been a while.  Yeah.  Hey, Anthony, really fast.  We've got to tell everyone that, are we going to be allowed to do this one?  What?  The best ass contest starts Monday.  Ah.  There it is.  Just like the best boob contest.  Exactly like that, except we're looking at booties.  Ace.  And, um, what are we giving away?  No, what are we giving away?  What's the grand prize for the best boutique contest?  Ah, it's a three-day weekend to Vegas. 
[01:39:30]  Nice, right?  Thank you, nice lady.  Nothing.  This is the deal.  Starting Monday, ladies, open door policy.  Once again, you just come on down, show off your, uh, your back, uh, your back end.  We'll take pictures.  Mm-hmm.  And you'll have a week to do that.  And then we'll narrow it down to some qualifiers, and you know the deal from there.  But basically, you need to know, starting Monday between three and seven, come on down  and show us your ass.  Yes.  Only hot asses, please. 
[01:40:00]  Why, last time, uh, you don't want those, uh, sisters showing up with the big asses  that they had?  No, I'll check that out.  Put those, uh-huh.  Put those up on the site?  I'll take a little teak, but it's going to run the same way.  We pick our finalists, it goes on the website, and you get to vote.  Right.  So we need the ladies to start, uh, showing up this coming Monday.  Nice.  All next week.  So if you can't make a Monday, you know, just pick a day, okay?  Uh, how many pairs can we give away?  Three pairs?  All right, we got three pairs of tickets to the Jerry Red Wilson Comedy Benefit. 
[01:40:30]  This is going to be cool.  A lot of guys you know and love from the show will be performing, including Jim Brewer,  Louis Black, and Adam Farrar.  Others, Janine Garofalo, Daryl Hammond, Colin Quinn, Greg Fitzsimmons, and David Tell.  March 13th at Town Hall.  That's next Tuesday.

[01:41:00]  You will never see a more wretched hive of gum and villainy.  1027.  WNEW.  We sure run the spectrum on this show.  One day you could be so aroused by what's going on, and the next day you could just be puking.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Fresh meat on the way.  1027 WNEW.  All right, we're back on the hotline. 
[01:41:30]  Louis Black, Anthony.  Yes.  He has no idea why he's calling into the show today.  Louis!  I have no idea.  Hello.  You have no idea, right?  No, except that Rick said call in because you got some psychotic contest.  Well, we're in a bit of trouble.  What?  You seem to be the voice of reason for our show because you have been involved in the past in a contest where things went horribly wrong.  Yeah, exactly.  And that's what I spent an hour discussing over it.  I had a meeting for a gig, you know, to do something possibly for, and that's all I talked about. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know, the Voyeur Bus made the latest issue of FHM Magazine.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  They did a thing called the 20 greatest vehicles of all time, and the Voyeur Bus came in in 16th place.  That's not bad.  Not bad, right?  Yeah.  And we came in at 23rd.  Talked about the arrest.  It mentioned the show.  It mentioned the radio station.  A picture of the Voyeur Bus is pretty cool.  Very nice. 
[01:42:30]  So, yeah, you were involved with the Team Voyeur Bus, and it went horribly wrong,  as we all know.  Yeah, it went awry.  So, I guess Ann and I are just looking for someone that is in the know and is brave enough  to tell us no.  Right.  All right, so we came up with this contest.  We got this trip to WrestleMania, Louis.  Mm-hmm.  The boss has already hung up on us, and we have a meeting planned for tomorrow.  So, just to give you a little taste of what we've been dealing with today.  Excellent.  The contest is called Run Around Park for Erin. 
[01:43:00]  Mm-hmm.  Any problems so far?  No, so far so good.  A girl named Erin.  Yes.  And, uh...  She's the one who got, uh...  Who's Erin?  She the one who I think?  No, Erin's just, uh...  She's a girl.  Oh, okay.  From the show.  At this point, it doesn't even matter who Erin is.  Okay.  All right, so far so good.  So far so good.  Okay.  And you run around the park for Erin.  Right.  Now, you find her in the park.  Uh-huh.  Anybody can play.  Any guy can play.  Are you into those reality shows, Louis? 
[01:43:30]  Well, you know, uh, you know, I find them delightful.  They're really, you know...  Okay, all right.  They're really good for the, uh...  You know, when it comes to expanding consciousness, there's nothing better than that stunted horse crap.  You know, there's been a lot of articles in the papers lately about reality shows and how far they're going to take it, right?  Right.  Okay, so it's our little reality show, kind of like a little take on Running Man.  Right.  If you will.  Okay.  So, Erin is, uh, set loose in the park.  Yeah.  40 to 45 minutes later, anyone who wants to try to find Erin, uh, is allowed to. 
[01:44:00]  Uh-huh.  And they go search out Erin in the park.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  The first person to find Erin...  Uh-huh.  ...and, uh, pull the panties off of Erin...  Uh-huh.  ...wins the trip to WrestleMania in Houston, Texas.  Right.  Pull her panties off?  Pull the panties off of Erin.  Yeah.  And she said it's okay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, she's okay with it.  Um, we'd make sure someone's watching her.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, anybody, uh, can play. 
[01:44:30]  And her job, she would get more prizes if she could evade the contestants.  Right?  Uh-huh.  Um, every hour that passes by, she gets a better prize.  Right.  So her motivation here is to run away.  How many contestants?  As many as want to, uh, try to find her.  Oh, with your audience?  It could be hundreds.  Run around the park for Erin.  Hundreds?  It could be thousands.  It could be thousands, sure.  Which park?  I was just...  I was just...  Hopkins Square?  Central Park.  Central Park.  Central Park. 
[01:45:00]  Run around the park for Erin.  So what's the problem?  Look at that.  See?  Here's a guy that got arrested for us.  Yeah, but I mean, if she's agreed to it...  Uh-huh.  She has agreed.  Um, she's...  We have guaranteed her safety because there will be people with her.  Mm-hmm.  Like bodyguard types, you know, security.  Matter of fact, uh, a bunch of people from the NYPD said they would help.  Mm-hmm.  Um, uh, take care of Erin.  That happened last time they helped.  Yeah.  And, and also, she would be easily recognizable as, uh, the person that these people are looking 
[01:45:30]  for, so there's no, uh, no cases of mistaken identity.  Well, yeah, that would have to be.  Yeah.  I didn't even think of that.  Well, see?  We're thinking.  Yeah, well, they've got to be given something.  You've got to know.  Why would she be recognizable?  I don't even want to hear.  So, uh, Ken Stevens called from Washington.  Mm-hmm.  Um, he wasn't happy, and he pretty much said, no, no, no, no, no, and hung up on us.  Mm-hmm.  And now we have to discuss this tomorrow.  Run around the park for Erin. 
[01:46:00]  What's the problem?  You're being serious, right?  Yeah.  I mean, if she agreed.  She agreed.  Then I don't see what the problem is.  I'll even go one step further and give something away.  Lewis.  The panties are just kind of hanging off her.  Dangling off the side, like flag football.  Like flag football.  Yeah.  And the only reason we have that, because if there's a lot of guys chasing Erin, it's got  to be the first guy that grabs the panties.  Right.  Yeah.  To determine who won the trip.  Mm-hmm.  And the boss had a problem with it.  That doesn't, I don't, compared to what the other stuff, no. 
[01:46:30]  Dan from Hoboken, apparently Lewis doesn't automatically think acronyms like Jane Moore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  What do you mean acronyms?  What is that?  Nothing.  No, no.  What does that mean?  Nothing.  I don't know.  What's an acronym?  I don't even know what an acronym is.  I'm not even sure.  That's a big word for me.  Supposed to be smart.  I really don't know what that is.  Yeah.  Acronym.  It's some weird thing.  I don't know.  Run around the park for Aaron.  Run around the park for Aaron.  Oh, my God. 
[01:47:00]  What?  So what?  What?  I missed that.  What?  If I missed it, to hell with it.  See?  See?  You know?  They had a little problem.  And it's R-A-P-F-E.  Right.  Which is RAPF-E.  RAPF-E.  Hello?  I've never heard anybody commit a RAPF-E.  Right.  Right.  That's exactly it.  But in a lot of acronyms, I don't think they count the word for.  No.  You can't call it that.  You can't say.  You can't do the acronym.  We might have called it that in the beginning just to get the contest kind of rolling along. 
[01:47:30]  But might have said it was the R-A-P-E.  Yeah.  Right.  The E-A-A-A-A.  But since, we have just referred to it as run around park for Aaron.  Well, we should, boys.  Because we can't be tossing that word of our own lightly.  You know?  Right.  Even though I don't even work in an office.  Even in life, no, we can't toss that word around lightly.  Right.  You know?  All right.  So.  You know, I mean, basically, no one should be doing R-A-P-E. 
[01:48:00]  Of course.  Of course not.  And.  It's not part of the contest.  Well, no, it's not part of the contest.  There's nothing sexual about the contest.  No one was going to get hurt.  Right.  All right.  I bet that's an unusual one.  But did Jay get that immediately, that little pig?  Isn't that amazing?  You got it?  Yeah.  Jay figured it out right away.  Man, not, not, no, not Mr. Nice Guy.  Lewis?  Yeah.  Lewis, for the love of God, tell us no.  Someone has to do it.  Lewis, be the man and tell us no.  Tell us no.  If Aaron said yes, I don't know how I can say no.  Oh. 
[01:48:30]  Are you going to play?  No.  Not quite.  You know why?  That requires running, okay?  I am not going to scoot about the park.  No.  Do I walk through the park on any given day?  No.  Okay?  Never.  So am I going to race over there?  No.  So everyone is outraged, Lewis.  Everybody's outraged except me?  Some media outlets are starting to call.  Well, you can't, you shouldn't have called it R-A-P-E.  Well, we can explain that too, though.  Uh-huh.  For anyone that wants to listen. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  Um, you got me on the phone.  These girls were calling us yesterday.  And you can even play the tape back.  Ant and I were shocked.  They were talking about rape fantasies.  They have these fantasies.  They participate.  No, Lewis, Lewis.  And I don't want to make a joke out of this.  They called with these rape fantasies.  Like, yeah, it's something I'm into.  It's like, you know, I'm into lesbians.  Or I'm into feet.  Or I'm into this.  This is what they are into.  This is their fetish.  And we were, quite frankly, shocked. 
[01:49:30]  I'm shocked.  And her name was Erin.  So we came up, that's how it kind of evolved.  Uh-huh.  From there.  It would be a good contest.  A good way to give away the tickets.  And almost, in a weird, twisted way, kind of fulfills one of these fantasies she has.  Well, you know, yeah, but women don't really want to just be, you know, you want to be, I think, raped by a guy you know, basically, don't you?  I mean, it's not like you want some guy in the middle of the night that comes sneaking around with liquor breath.  You know what?  If that isn't a new sweeper. 
[01:50:00]  What?  If that isn't a new sweeper on a show, you want to be raped by somebody you know.  Well, I mean, if that's a fantasy.  If you're going to tell me women are fantasizing about this, then it's got to be by some guy that they, you know, they want some guy that they're going out with to just take them.  That's a different thing.  That's called just, you know, you know, you know, that's called let's get in the broom closet now.  Lewis, we have talked in the past.  I can't believe I'm talking like this.  But we have talked in the past where these girls will really play it out, though.  They will leave their door unlocked. 
[01:50:30]  They will tell.  No.  I'm telling you.  Not for a stranger to come in, but the boyfriend or the husband or something.  We talked to a girl yesterday.  It's not like rough sex, Lewis, where maybe you pin her, you know, her arms down or something.  I mean, some of these girls really get into the whole scenario of the thing.  Wow.  Yeah.  I think it's pretty effed up.  It is effed up unless it's somebody they know.  And then it's just, you know, that kind of thing.  Lewis, how sick is this?  The girl yesterday was talking about when she was eight or nine and her little friend would come over. 
[01:51:00]  And they're both girls.  And she would hide behind the door with her father's trench coat on and a knife.  We are so screwed.  And then go at this girl.  No.  Yes.  Can I interrupt?  Yes, Sophie.  This whole thing has taken on a life of its own.  You know we just had Jay on?  Right.  Yeah.  I don't know if Jay's doing us a favor or trying to screw us over bad.  Andy.  Yeah, he was just on a radio station called Comedy World in Los Angeles. 
[01:51:30]  I listened to it on the Internet.  Yeah.  But is it an Internet radio station or one that broadcasts that just happens to be on the Internet?  No, it's a real radio station, but it's also on the Internet.  And he was talking about the rape thing.  He was talking about the runaround.  Yeah, I only heard a section of it because my computer's not that good.  But I know he was mentioning the contest.  All right.  Thank you, Andy.  No problem.  Jay spreading the word for us.  That's good.  That's excellent.  That's really good.  Don't laugh, Louis. 
[01:52:00]  So that's how it all came about, and now everyone's kind of outraged.  Well, I mean, using the word is what outraged them, but if it's just basically a bunch of guys chasing a woman to get her panty, it's a different thing.  Okay?  Hello?  Hello?  Is anybody home?  And I'm the arbiter of good taste.  How did that happen?  All right.  I mean, were you surprised that I took this position?  I am.  I thought you'd be outraged yelling no, no, no, something.  Well, not if Aaron wants to do it. 
[01:52:30]  Why would you be, you know?  It's just using that.  You can't use that word because it basically kind of, you know what everybody thinks.  You use that word.  It's in the media.  When you use that word for a contest, people go, well, you're glorifying the action.  Hey, Louis, it was never a word.  It was an acronym.  Well, then why did he just keep his mouth shut?  I don't know.  I can't believe you guys, though.  I just don't believe one.  I can't believe I missed that.  But, of course, you know, I'm like, you know, I'm like Heidi, really. 
[01:53:00]  Like Heidi.  Maybe we explained too much from the beginning.  But certainly, well, you did.  You were explaining it in such a way that I thought, well, this isn't so bad.  And the way you were explaining it, it sounds almost like fun.  It's right.  It's still not bad as long as we don't use the word.  And we understand that.  Because the word has nothing to do with what we're doing.  The word has huge connotations, especially in Central Park.  Again, bring up the voyeur bus thing.  It sounded all well and good.  But if we would have said things like illegal and incarceration to you while we were telling you about how nice the voyeur bus was, you never would have gone. 
[01:53:30]  No, of course not.  See?  Yeah.  But who thought there was going to be the thing you've been running around town for days?  Right.  Louis?  Yeah, and it's not against the law.  Louis, are you okay with our other contest called Capture Underwear Near Times Square?  Perfect.  Cool.  That's perfect.  That's just...  That's really unbelievable.  Who was it?  Was that Rick who wrote that out, that little thing?  I don't know who that was.  No, I've got to give Dan from Hoboken that one.  Is that right?  That's unbelievable.  You have to have your underwear near Times Square.  Oh, man.  Well, you had a problem with Central Park. 
[01:54:00]  I'm just thinking maybe we should move it out of the park.  No, you can't do it in Times Square.  We've got to be a place where she can hide.  All right.  Well, I don't think it's happening because when Ken hangs up, that's not a good sign.  Is that right?  Yeah.  What about doing it in Macy's?  In Macy's?  Yeah.  In Macy's window.  There you go.  No, not in the window.  You know, there's a lot of places to hide in Macy's.  I'd love to see your guys, that audience, running around Macy's.  Well, we had the Sex for Sam thing where people did have sex, actual sex, all over locations  in the city. 
[01:54:30]  Why is...  That wasn't a problem.  Get those flowers.  Why is Stinky...  Stinky.  Are these our goodbye flowers?  What are these?  Bon voyage.  What is...  Who are they from?  They're warning Anthony to watch his back from MafiaMob.com.  Uh-oh.  That ain't good.  They send me flowers?  Mafia Mob sending me flowers?  Oh, man.  I want all inquiries made as to where these came from.  This will not go unanswered.  Oh, man.  That's the new way they're doing hits now, is with flowers? 
[01:55:00]  You're getting way too involved with MafiaMob.com, man.  I am so close to Lieutenant.  Lieutenant, it'll make you pee yourself.  No.  Very close to Lieutenant right now.  I just got to either whack someone else, or I have a nice job coming up soon that I  can't talk about, but I got to pull it off.  You know what I'm talking about, Louis.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Louis, we're into some crap these days.  Oh, man.  You guys...  We need help.  Man.  You guys, we need some therapy.  We're going to admit it today. 
[01:55:30]  We need help.  Well, I'm very surprised at their reaction.  Mark, real fast?  Yeah.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I was thinking, why don't you start the contest in Jersey and go over to Central Park?  That way, you can cross state lines and make it a federal offense.  That's just when you thought it couldn't get worse.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  That's funny.  A lot of people are on the phone lines, and they want to wish us goodbye.  No.  Come on.  Really, that's nothing. 
[01:56:00]  All right, Louis, a couple other things while we have you on the phone.  Do you have anything on Dick Cheney?  Oh, yeah.  Well, of course.  Now, I have said this.  I know.  That's why I'm asking.  Hello.  You've said a lot of this.  First off, four heart attacks I thought he had.  He had five before whatever this is.  You know, this is unbelievable.  If this is not like, okay, nothing up.  Game's over.  Get him out.  But you know who's next in line is Strom Thurmond.  Did you know that?  No, that's not true.  Yes, it is.  We went over this yesterday. 
[01:56:30]  No, he's the president pro tem.  Isn't he next?  Well, if they both got killed?  No, but he's next in line to take Cheney's place, isn't he?  No.  I think the president gets to choose a replacement.  He already lost his right of choice since he picked a guy who's half dead to begin with.  And then both houses have to confirm his choice.  Right.  And that's how we got Gerald Ford.  Oh, for God's sake.  No, I can't.  It's unbelievable.  And if they're not asking him to leave in, he, what's his name, Bush called this precautionary.  Precautionary? 
[01:57:00]  They're sticking another pin in his heart, for God's sake.  That's not precautionary.  It's called, hello, you're about two minutes away from the death zone.  And I like how they have to let everybody think he's okay.  Wouldn't any other human be in the hospital for about a week, at least, or two weeks, when  something like this happens?  This guy, a few hours later, he's out.  No, it's cool.  They just, like, roto-rooted my aorta.  Again.  Do you want to leave the president alone for too long?  No.  You can't.  And then he wasn't.  No.  The president, you know, today, he's gone to Camp David three times since he's been in office 
[01:57:30]  in the first hundred days, right?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Clinton didn't, and Camp David is, you know, like fun camp.  It's, you know, it's like fun house.  Who knows what goes on there?  Oh, for God's sake, it's in the middle of the Maryland woods.  They're just jumping around nude.  And then he's been there three times.  Clinton didn't go until the second term.  This guy's already taken three breaks.  Three times? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  In the first hundred days.  And I love what he had to say yesterday about that thing in San Diego.  Where I will say the weather's always nice, okay?  They can talk about our city all they want, but that's what happens when the weather's  always nice.  That kid was depressed, and he knew, he said, and he didn't blame it on himself as he should  have, and he blamed others.  Yeah.  And that's what happens.  When the weather's always nice and you feel bad, it's your fault.  And, you know, and then jackass gets on television.  Did you watch the moron?  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  His response?  Yeah.  What's the matter of teaching values?  Well, you know, what are you going to do?  Go house to house?  You lunatic?  How are you going to teach them?  Like, the school out there wasn't trying.  You know?  They were out there going, you know, we're into serious gunplay here in San Diego.  We got gunplay one, gunplay two.  The kid was going to be in here now.  He's in gunplay three.  Yeah, you're making a great point.  Well, it's ridiculous.  House to house.  And he never mentioned a gun had anything to do with it.  It's like, oh, the guns have nothing to do with it. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, it's just this value thing.  It's a gun!  You know, if the kid didn't have access to a gun, was he going to do it with a butter knife?  Maybe.  Oh, yeah, like poking a couple of eyes out, okay?  That's ridiculous.  That's unbe-  Well, I can't even say it.  Unbe-effing levable.  Exactly.  Lewis, are you trying to tread on our Second Amendment rights?  Yeah, uh-huh.  Those rights were put in when we were wandering around and there were bears everywhere.  For God's sake, you had to shoot dinner. 
[01:59:30]  Now it's like, come on, get a grip.  Lewis, I think they're put in place to keep whatever government we have in check, knowing that...  Oh, yeah, boy, that's what's going to stop the nut chops.  You know what?  If the government...  What makes people think that the government, which has not done crap for us in 180 years,  which is basically an immobile object that can't do anything,  that these guys are going to coalesce and actually lead some sort of a...  Oh, boy, they're going to round us up. 
[02:00:00]  They're not even interested in helping us.  For God's sake.  Oh, yeah, boy, we're going to stop the government.  Oh, yeah, that'd be great.  Have those idiots attack the idiots wearing the uniforms in Michigan.  That's something...  Now that would be reality TV.  Now, okay, then maybe not our government,  but don't you think another government would be more inclined to attack us  if they knew that the public wasn't armed?  What government would that be?  Which one are you talking about?  You love pushing money. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, yeah, Mexico.  Canada?  They'd come up here with their pot.  They could come up here with their pot and immobilize us in 10 minutes.  They need to bring guns for it.  What about Canada?  All they got to do is stand in every corner going,  free pot, game's over.  North Mexico.  North Mexico.  What about Canada?  Oh, Canada, yeah, well, yeah, they're right.  They're so busy at their health care clinics,  they haven't got time to move.  They got free health care.  Why would you leave a hospital?  I don't know.  They'd be there all the time.  I'm more like Charlton Heston on this one. 
[02:01:00]  From my cold, dead hand.  From my cold, dead hand, Lewis.  Oh, good.  But you went and you looked, you schmuck.  Even though I know you're about as nutty as a fruitcake,  I trust you with a gun, okay?  And I think if you had kids and if the state would allow it,  you would lock the gun up so the kid couldn't get out of it.  You wouldn't be going, look at what daddy's got.  And when I die, you get to have this.  I don't think you do that, okay?  I'm talking about the rest of these loom jobs.  You've got to go to these things. 
[02:01:30]  They're going to, like, circus tents and buy weapons.  Hello?  Is anybody home?  It's a constitutional right.  What do you need?  I need a bazooka.  It's a constitutional right.  It's not a constitutional right.  It's in the Constitution.  It was put in there for when there was, like,  when we had a reason to have it.  Oh, now you're saying that the Constitution should change  our First, our Second Amendment right  just because the times have changed?  No, I don't think they should change it.  But I do think, considering we've gone from people 
[02:02:00]  who knew what they were doing with guns  with people whose brains are sullied to the point where, you know,  you could basically, you know, kind of squeeze them  and oil would come out and not a drop of brain power  that you have to basically say,  look, before you get your gun,  you're going to have to wait three days.  Huh, huh, huh?  Is that exhausting?  I had to wait two weeks for a couch.  Okay?  And you couldn't wait three days for a gun  while we check to see if you're a nut job. 
[02:02:30]  That is a great line.  See, that is just, uh, that's the first step  of the anti-gun people, though.  Once they get that, then they go further.  They never stop.  Okay, and the gun people have got to stop being paranoid, too.  I'm more paranoid about Charlton Heston,  who's absolute proof of what happens to a man  when he doesn't get a shot for syphilis.  Okay?  There's somebody I want in leadership.  Talk about water on the brain.  He's got spirochetes just whipping through his head. 
[02:03:00]  I'm serious.  I bet if you check, if you check his number,  there's, like, big sores everywhere.  And he didn't even notice.  He didn't even notice.  God damn, Stephen, I shouldn't have sex with monkeys.  God damn, Zira gave me something.  Oh, my God.  Well, I guess, Lewis, we can agree to disagree.  I love yelling at you.  It's the best.  You love when you yell at me. 
[02:03:30]  It's great.  I love you yelling at me.  I love you coming up with this stuff.  It's great.  What are you kidding me?  That's what it's about.  Hey, Lewis, before...  It's about people screaming stuff.  Before we let you go,  any thoughts on the weather or the weathermen?  Oh, yeah.  Good job here, huh?  Yes, sir.  Why don't we just shut everything up?  You know, can they put a muzzle on them?  Rabies shots would be nice.  Oh, boy, they're watching us now.  Ooh, we're going to have a storm.  Let's make it a really big storm.  So they'll watch us all the time.  You know, it's like, you know, come on. 
[02:04:00]  The way I'm sitting in Aspen, Colorado,  with Norton, Norton and I are in an airport,  right, together in Denver, actually.  We've gotten into Denver.  Norton is sweating it because his plane's a little late.  Are we going to make it back, Lou?  I said, Jim, when was the last time  they said there'd be a big storm?  And there was a big storm.  Never.  Never.  I said, if they were saying it's going to be two inches,  I'd be freaking out.  That's exactly what we were saying yesterday.  Isn't it true?  That's how it is. 
[02:04:30]  When they give you a week's advance notice of a storm,  don't even sweat it.  You don't even have to worry.  When you wake up in the morning and go,  I didn't know about snow.  What's it snowing out?  Then you try to open your front door  and there's six feet in front of you.  Well, you know, you could say,  you know, you might want to,  you know, my mother lives in Maryland.  She's called me up.  She said it was like an insane asylum.  She said, you go to the store  and literally, you know,  all of those shelves in a giant supermarket  have no bread and water.  You know, nothing.  She said it was hysterical. 
[02:05:00]  She said you would have thought  we were being invaded by Martians.  The way they reacted.  You know, you can say we're going to have a storm  and it might be a bad storm,  but you don't sit there and go,  oh, my God, it's going to be the storm of the century.  There'll be, oh, boy,  there will be sewage coming down on us  and big giant ticks.  Rodents will rise from the earth.  There'll be big 17-foot rats.  You've got to watch them  because they come out when it snows.  I mean, it's like stupid.  Flaming hail.  I like what you guys did on Comedy Central there,  the storm of the century of the week. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Wasn't that good?  Perfect.  All right.  I got one thing to push, though, guys.  Oh, he's...  Oh, okay.  And you know.  You have carte blanche.  Well, this is a big...  Actually, this is a very good thing, actually.  And there's...  It's for...  And there's a lot of guys that you know.  Brewer is in it and Adam Ferrara.  We're going Tuesday.  Yeah.  It's the fundraiser for the Jerry Red Wilson Foundation.  Yes.  It's at Town Hall.  It's at 730 next Tuesday. 
[02:06:00]  And Daryl Hammond, who I just worked with in Colorado, is there.  Colin Quinn.  Janine Garofalo.  Garofalo.  Garofalo.  Jim Brewer will be there.  I'm there.  Attell is there.  Adam...  David Attell.  Adam Ferrara.  And Greg Fitzsimmons, who just won Best New Comic at Aspen.  Are you guys going to get, what, five minutes each?  Probably five minutes.  Which will be great.  It's going to rock.  It's going to be, I think, a great night, and it's for a great cause, because it's, you  know, Jerry got whacked, basically, you know, and he did not know. 
[02:06:30]  I mean, he just had no idea.  You know, the story of Jerry Red Wilson is pretty intense.  Brewer was telling us about it backstage in one of his shows recently.  Yeah, it is.  The guy was, what, ready to just explode onto the scene?  I mean, he was on, was it Carson or Leno at the time?  He was on Leno.  Leno, and then, what, two weeks later, he found out he was...  He dropped dead or something?  Yeah, two weeks later.  The weirdest thing was just, I mean, from what I know of the story, because he was out in  Los Angeles at the time.  He'd gone out there. 
[02:07:00]  He was, he just asked his, he just phoned to Hawaii and asked his girlfriend to marry  him.  And he thought he, and from what I heard, I mean, Greg really knows the story, probably  the best Fitzsimmons, but from what I heard was that, you know, he then found out that,  you know, he had an earache, and that's all, and he thought it was an earache.  You know, you think I'm flying.  And, you know, I get that from time to time.  And came back, and he was, and by the time, you know, I think that they got him to the  hospital, that was that. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, God, now I'm going to be a hypochondriac when I get an earache.  Oh, no kidding.  He went just like that?  I mean, what was the cause?  It was spinal meningitis.  Holy ass.  Which is why we're having the benefit, and he was just about to explode.  I mean, he had a series, and he was a funny guy, and he was a really nice guy, you know?  So you guys are all getting together for this.  Yeah.  And this year is the first really, they've done benefits before, and this is the first  time we've been able to step up with a big benefit, and I'm actually pleased to be a part  of it. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, we're all going down.  Because I know my discussions with you, when I go to heaven, just before they throw me  out, part of the tape will be us sitting around talking in the studio.  Yeah.  You know, I'll say to God, well, you know, can you open the door?  And I go, well, no, first you're going to have to look at this tape.  And it'll be the three of us, and a guy next to us throwing up a cat eyeball.  Yeah.  And then he'll say, well, you have to go.  And then I'll go, well, yeah, but I did that benefit.  He'll go, I don't care.  Get down there and tell your pals when you get there that you can't play pool for another ten years. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  Yeah, we're all going Tuesday.  Tickets are going fast for Ticketmaster, 212-307-4100, or Ticketmaster.com.  It's happening at Town Hall this Tuesday.  The Jerry Red Wilson Comedy Benefit.  All right, Louis.  You got it.  I'm going to call in tomorrow, or at least I'll listen tomorrow, to find out what happens  with your content.  The runaround part for Aaron, huh?  Yes.  All right.  And, Louis, remember, a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, 
[02:09:00]  the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.  Well, good.  And I can't wait to see you in uniform.  I cannot wait to see you all ready to go.  You know, sitting up there on the 10th floor there, you know, with your, you know, all done up,  wearing that duck outfit.  I cannot wait.  The O&A militia.  I cannot wait.  Oh, man.  Mr. Paintball.  I cannot wait to see it.  Hey, I did play paintball. 
[02:09:30]  I loved it.  I'm sure you did.  I would.  Isn't it time to hug a tree, Louis, you bed-wetting liberal?  I'm not a liberal.  I'm a psychotic.  Don't forget it.  I like that.  All right, man.  Good to talk to you guys.  Thank you.  Definitely.  Take it easy.  Thank you, Louis.  Bye-bye, guys.  It's our buddy, our pal, Louis Black, from Comedy Central's The Daily Show.  Opie and Anthony.  How are my little pigs today?  Do I have to drive the bus?  Can I ride on the bus? 
[02:10:00]  Where's the bus?  The thing with the young girl is I think we're going to have to, well, I'll go to court with  She's not 18.  She's not 18.  It's a mockery.  The election isn't over and there's no team.  Do I have to drive the bus?  Can I ride on the bus?  Where's the bus?  How are my little pigs today?  We use you for good radio.  We're not your friends.  Unbelievable.  Oh, my Lord.  Shoot me now.  The thing with the young girl is I think we're going to have to, well, I'll go to court with  She's not 18. 
[02:10:30]  Do I have to drive the bus?  Can I ride on the bus?  Where's the bus?  I don't know what's going to be, Anthony.  I've got to go blood in front of my ears.  1027.  1027.  How are my little pigs today?  We use you for good radio.  We're not your friend.  WNEW.  Another one of our pals checking in.  Yeah, Jim Norton.  I hear Brewer's checking in as well.  Is he?  Let's go to Jim. 
[02:11:00]  The pastor was supposed to be in today.  Brewer.  Yeah, but he had to get some family members to the airport.  Ah.  It is the storm of the century after all.  Storm of the century.  Jim Norton, what's going on?  I don't want to generalize, but all weathermen should die of AIDS.  Wow.  What's your problem?  How irritating is this?  I'm worried in Aspen about getting home three hours late the flight is.  There's a baby crying on the plane, and I wanted to get up and punch it in the face.  I wanted to drill my fist into its little toothless mouth. 
[02:11:30]  I hate children and weathermen.  Wow.  I've been in that seat, though, man, where the kid's just crying and crying, and everybody  gives that look, and the mommies give the look like, oh, it's okay.  Yeah, isn't it cute?  No, it's not.  I could smother it with an airline pillow if they were big enough.  And I did see Lewis in Aspen.  I had a great time.  Yeah?  Yeah.  45% of the oxygen, and everything closed at 11. 
[02:12:00]  It was a great, great week.  45% of the oxygen.  Yeah, that's kind of rough, huh?  It's a great place to hang out if you hate breathing and drive a milk truck.  There's no reason to go to Aspen.  I called an escort service.  It's absolutely true.  $3,000 they wanted.  Three grand?  Yeah, and then I'm like, are you out of your mind?  She goes, she's really pretty.  Do I get to chop her head off and keep it when I'm finished?  Three grand for taco.  Better jump off her body and pack my bags for me. 
[02:12:30]  That's absolutely true.  Three grand?  I'm like, well, for how long?  I mean, you can't say certain things on the phone.  For how long?  She's like, well, until you're finished.  I'm like, sweetheart, that's $180,000 an hour.  Boom, boom.  What do they go for in New York?  Oh, wait, $200,000, $300,000 maybe?  Yeah?  Yeah, believe me, it's very doable, very doable.  For good quality?  Why?  Did that one get dumped?  That probably did.  I love laughing. 
[02:13:00]  Hey, man, I want to just congratulate you.  I love the fact that you guys are running a contest that should be done during the Puerto Rican Day parade.  Okay.  See, now we know we've gone too far.  If Norton's on our side, Norton likes this idea.  We have found the line.  I am 100% behind it.  I think what you ought to do is get a woman and hide a crumpled up WOW sticker in her balloon knot and send out 10,000 drunken O&A fans with pliers.  The winner gets wrestling tickets, lubricant, and a director's cut of the accused.  Wow, that is horrid. 
[02:13:30]  I am so behind this contest.  I just wanted you to know that.  All right, Anthony, it's official.  We can't do the contest.  I am 100% and I will be participating in it.  I am really behind you guys on this one.  Anything Norton's into, we've got to stay away from.  I'm out, guys.  I've got to call a girl.  I just wanted to check in.  All right, Jim.  That's great.  And one thing, people have to go to the Jerry Red Wilson benefit.  He was a great, great comic and he's very, very missed by other comics.  So if you guys can make it, go to it.  There's a lot of great comics on the show. 
[02:14:00]  It's going to be a lot of fun.  We're all going Tuesday.  Yeah, absolutely.  So people have to get tickets and go and support this because Jerry was a very loved comic.  It's at Town Hall and tickets are available through Ticketmaster.com.  All right, boys.  I'll see you soon.  Thank you, Jim.  Thank you.  He's plugging.  He was a very loved comic right after he says he wanted to smother a small child with an airline pillow  and punch him right in his toothless face.  You guys are classic.  That guy's got problems, Anthony.  He's great.  212-757-1027 is our phone number. 
[02:14:30]  Once again, I want to remind the ladies the Best Ass Contest starts Monday.  Monday, yes.  Just come down.  Just like the boob contest, you just show up sometime next week.  We take pictures of your bootay.  And then the listeners will eventually vote for their favorite butt.  And we've got a nice trip to Las Vegas that we're giving away, okay?  Yeah.  We pick the finalists, put it on the site.  Just like the boob contest, only the asses.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  It looks like James Hetfield is checking in today. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, really?  We were talking about Metallic and that interview that's in the latest issue of Playboy.  Maybe he was listening to us today.  Mr. Hetfield.  Hey, dude.  Hey.  What's going on?  What's up?  What the F?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, hey.  Ooh.  We got this, dude.  We got second whole fag bands out there, dude.  Hold on.  We were just playing the same song at the same time. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  It's so good if you have an album, dude.  You're going to have a little nester in your bag.  Woo-hoo.  Oh, yeah.  Woo.  James, what's your problem, man?  Dude, let me speak for Laura.  James, he's just really upset that you guys were saying bad things about us.  Dude, personally, I don't really give two Fs what you say.  I stand firmly on it.  Give me a ball.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:16:00]  Lars, you ruined it for everybody.  Dude, shut up, dude.  Dude, the only thing that was ruined was that the people, these guys are pirates.  They're no good.  They're, like, raping and pillaging.  What do you think we did for?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come with you.  Yeah, dude.  It's James again.  Why are you being such a prick to Jason Neustadt?  Hey, dude.  We gave him everything he had.  If he wants to go back and flip burgers, dude, it's fine for him. 
[02:16:30]  Guy just wants to make his own music.  We gave him a lot of money.  We gave him lots of tours.  Hey, yeah.  Tours.  Ooh.  Kind of wants to make his own music.  That's what I do.  Now he can make his own, but not while he's done.  My chomp.  No, you want to hear it, people?  Oh.  Yeah.  Hello, dudes.  Yes.  James is really hopped up.  He's a little annoyed that you, whatever you dudes are, but. 
[02:17:00]  You, you little troll fidget.  What'd you do?  You wrecked an actor.  Did I come there and take your little nuts in to cut your hair like us?  You're just as a sellout.  That was my imitation, dude, of a brewery laugh.  That was pretty good, Lars.  Hold on a second, James.  You're breaking things.  Goddamn.  Woo-hoo.  Atta-gie.  All right, there, James. 
[02:17:30]  Anyway, yeah, dudes, we might even come down and check out all these other, hold on, James  wants to say, hey, dude.  Yeah, James, yeah.  Who's that other dude on?  Uh, Lars.  Jim Norton?  Oh, yeah, Jim Norton.  Who's that other black man?  Uh, Louis Black.  Louis Black.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  He's funny.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  He just left the building, but, dude, all the fags. 
[02:18:00]  They call out and say, we're not, we're dying.  I'm just going to let you know we'll be back.  And we're going to come and we're going to have music so loud, we're going to, your balls  are just going to fall out and freak in the Philippines.  Hey, Lars, why did you appear on Millionaire?  You, uh, went on Regis Philbin's Millionaire Show like some kind of a sellout.  Well, I don't know if you want to call it sellout, dude.  It's just basically charity for dudes that don't have it. 
[02:18:30]  And I...  Well, well said, Lars.  Well, dudes, everyone's got a funny, you know, sense of humor, and I figure they asked  me, because I'm by far brighter than the reach, dude.  Lars O'Rig from Metallica.  Yeah.  I feel it on me, girl. 
[02:19:00]  Well, anyway, dude, that was fun, Bill and Regis.  He has a little hottie as a daughter.  They don't tell you that, but they give you a makeup room, dude, and all that.  They're pretty much...  Yeah, she's quite a piece of ass, I gotta say.  Gelman tried to bang her once.  Get off my daughter, Gelman!  But anyway, dudes, we gotta go.  We're getting ready to go find another dude to jump in for the base, and we'll come back  and rock.  We will rock!  Yeah! 
[02:19:30]  I was just wondering if drunk George W. was there.  Well, dude, I'll go look for him.  Yeah, because, you know, the whole Dick Cheney thing.  Hello!  Hey, drunk!  You're not gonna believe what I'm hanging out with!  Who are you hanging out with?  Justin Metallica.  You're hanging with Metallica?  Yeah, I figured, hey, I got a great song.  You know, I called up...  I called up by Fred...  Who the hell is over there in Iraq? 
[02:20:00]  Saddam Hussein.  Saddam!  And, you know, I don't like what he did to my father.  Yeah, you kind of dissed your dad.  Yeah, and how I feel about that, I say, hey, first things first, I'm gonna bust you in your  stop box.  And that's what I did.  And people are like, hey, hey, hi, hey, hey, look.  Anyone that rides a goddamn camel, they don't even belong to him. 
[02:20:30]  You know what I mean?  Come on.  Use your head.  Jesus Christ.  People are up.  I got Susan Sarandon with two fingers up her plunge knot talking about this and hooping and  hollering about that.  Hold on.  And I love him so quickly and cheese.  Yeah.  That is my new...  You know how Bill Crickle has his own song? 
[02:21:00]  He has a saxophone.  Whatever.  That's a song you're into.  But I got this baby now.  God bless America.  I'm bringing Reagan back to the house and I'm multiplying him by a lot.  Sounds like Metallica's problem.  Well, I put that TV right on the top of a missile, the first missile I shot.  So they can listen to Metallica if I bomb their little camel faces off. 
[02:21:30]  Hey, sweetheart.  I'm on the phone.  Who's that?  Oh, that's a little cheese in training.  She's the new secretary.  Do you want to see a little?  Say hi.  Hi.  Say hi.  She's the brightest thing in the world.  She's working on it.  They're love nuts.  Come here.  You want to talk to these a-holes?  Let me think...  Hold on a second. 
[02:22:00]  Ooh.  Yeah.  I love the bush.  Ooh.  Forget it.  Yeah.  Bro, it's a pot.  I totally love George Bush and everything he stands for, and him and Regis, and we're going  to come back and we're going to rock.  Yeah.  Oh, that's funny.  Anyway, dude, these guys, we're going to party.  We're going to beat some Mexicans.  And we're going to make this a country again, okay? 
[02:22:30]  And you're not worried about Dick Cheney, huh?  Hey.  Yeah.  Look.  Between you and me, Dick does things he shouldn't be doing.  Okay?  He parties hard.  He just had a heart attack.  I know that, Dick's face.  What do you think?  I'm out in the woods?  What do you think?  I'm out in the left field with a goddamn bowling ball?  That's all I understand.  Why didn't you help me out here?  Huh?  Where are you at? 
[02:23:00]  Freaking.  You sound like you've had a couple.  You sound like you've had a couple.  Well, you'd have a couple, too, if you got chinks and goddamn students who are underwriting  letters every five minutes.  Jesus Christ.  I just want to load taxes and buy a f-ing cheeseburger and people up my license.  Am I right or am I wrong?  I guess you're right there.  Oh, hold on.  Good part.  Doesn't that just make you want to knock a goddamn Arab office, camel? 
[02:23:30]  See you later, camel, Bucky.  I sure am the best of my father.  Still holding the grudge.  I've got to go crap, so it's been nice talking.  All right.  All right, George W.  He just hangs up.  Hung up.  He always does that.  Poor guy.  All right.  Now, that's Jim Brewer.  I've got to give him credit for all that.  He was supposed to be here today. 
[02:24:00]  Hey, look who's on the phone.  Andrew Dice Club.  No.  We've had every gaminian that's ever appeared on the show today.  Oh, no.  Even just saying that, you scared the audience.  Okay.  So, Dice.  So, we were talking about the Best Ass Contest.  So, that'll start Monday.  So, ladies, please come on down and show us what you got, okay?  Come down.  Some great prizes up for grabs.  And all you have to do is show up next week between 3 and 7, Monday through Friday.  Yeah.  Come on.  You got a nice ass?  Come on down.  All right. 
[02:24:30]  Take a break.  Regroup, Anthony.  Anthony.  We have more tickets for that benefit.  This is going to be really cool.  Got a lot of the players checking in to say hey.  We got two more pairs of tickets, excuse me, for the Jerry Red Wilson Comedy Benefit featuring  Jim Brewer, Louis Black, and Adam Farrar, and a bunch of other fine comedians.  It's happening March 13th at Town Hall.  That's next Tuesday.  A bunch of us are going down.  That's in the Times Square area.  And tickets available now through Ticketmaster.  212-307-4100 or Ticketmaster.com. 
[02:25:00]  And we'll give out a couple to a couple of random callers.  It's 212-757-1027.  Get your balls out.  Clap your ass up.  Get your penis.  It's today.  That could be the gayest thing I've ever heard.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're not homosexual, but we are willing to learn.  1027-WNEW.  212-757-1027 is our phone number. 
[02:25:30]  We have survived the storm of the century.  Yeah.  Oh, thank God.  Thank God is right, Anthony.  We're very nervous.  People want to talk about this teen mother in bedside.  Yeah.  There's nothing to say here.  What happened?  Oh, she threw the baby to the dog.  Oh! 
[02:26:00]  Are you insane?  Dude, I did that just to see your face.  Are you insane?  I totally did that just to see your face.  Look at you.  You looked at me like, are you insane?  Holy ass.  It's called thinning the herd.  Well, if you haven't heard the story, I mean, you hear about a story like this and you still  don't believe in the death penalty, something is wrong with you.  Why should this person be allowed to live another minute on this fine planet? 
[02:26:30]  Oh, it'll be because she's young and had no guidance and anything else a lawyer could spit out  as to why she shouldn't have to be punished for this.  A Brooklyn baby died the kind of death that could make the toughest cop or firefighter cry.  A teenager who hid her pregnancy from her ailing mother and kid sister  delivered the infant herself several days ago.  Then, 16-year-old Lisa Small allegedly hurled her child into the small yard behind her tenement 
[02:27:00]  where the family's snarling, hungry dog was waiting.  Oh, my God.  I can't even read the rest of this.  Ah, what's going on here, man?  Oh, my God.  What's the matter, Ropey?  What's the problem here? 
[02:27:30]  You're insane.  I can't even read the rest of the story.  Oh, my God.  It was pretty awful.  It's a horrible story.  She threw her baby down into the backyard, and the dog ate it. 
[02:28:00]  You know, I got another point I want to bring up here.  It's amazing that they could print something like this in a paper, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, and no one's going to get offended by the details,  but God forbid you show, like, a nipple or something in the Daily News or the Post,  everyone's outraged.  Death, okay.  Sex, no okay.  But they could print something like this.  I mean, this...  I haven't read anything this horrific in years.  Police learned her grisly secret yesterday  after a neighbor called 911 and reported a newborn being eaten by a dog. 
[02:28:30]  The Pitbull-Rottweiler mix was gnawing on a corpse so mangled  it was impossible to determine its sex.  Hmm.  How about that?  And it just goes on and on, and you can put this in the paper.  Yeah.  But a nude woman or something, God forbid. 
[02:29:00]  God forbid.  Yeah, please.  I mean, it's called thinning the herd.  It's what they do.  That's what people do occasionally.  What do you think?  That kid would have had a great life?  I think 16 years old.  But not every kid born to, like, a piece of trash like this,  and, you know, turns out bad.  No, but, you know, now we don't have to worry about it.  Now we don't have to worry about it.  Get rid of the mother. 
[02:29:30]  She took care of it herself.  Get rid of the mother.  Well, we can only hope that maybe she contracted some kind of infection,  giving birth to her own kid.  And maybe something will happen.  What are you going to do?  And then at 16, she has a kid, and she's living in a tenement.  The mom is incapacitated, from what I hear, and she's raising another six-year-old herself.  Please.  And, by the way, you just took the title today.  What?  I held it for a very long time. 
[02:30:00]  Joe, what's up?  Just calling to let you guys know that, Anthony, you've hit the official low point on the chart.  You are officially the sickest F on this show.  Come on.  I'm just saying.  You know something?  Look at that.  You just took my title away.  Everyone feels all bad today.  Everyone feels all bad.  It is horrible.  I'm not saying it's not a horrible thing.  What I'm saying is this is the way of the world.  What happens is in some way, shape, or form, there are checks in place that try to keep down the population of people that shouldn't be alive. 
[02:30:30]  In the jungle, maybe.  This woman's offspring, who knows?  I really don't care.  Fine.  She feeds it to the goddamn dog.  Unfortunately, the dog's going to have to pay for this one.  They'll put the dog to sleep, and the woman will stay alive.  The dog is doing what it knows.  You already know it, but you are going to hell.  All right, Joe.  Take care, guys.  And then someone's going to argue the death penalty with me.  Shut up.  Don't want to hear it. 
[02:31:00]  Don't want to hear it.  Nicole, what's up?  Hi.  Hey.  Well, I think she should be killed.  Well, that's obvious.  They never give death penalty to people like that.  Let me tell you something about the death penalty.  When did we take care of that little problem in New York State?  We finally got a death penalty.  I don't know.  Seriously, what?  Eight years.  Almost eight years ago?  They never use it.  No one has died yet.  No one used it.  No one has died.  Remember, everyone was like, woo-hoo, we finally have the death penalty.  Doesn't matter.  When do we start the killing?  Well, my suggestion is that I think it might make it go a little faster. 
[02:31:30]  They start earmarking the 1040s of the people that are against it so that they can pay to  keep those people in prison.  You know, it costs more to execute someone.  I love that.  Oh, please.  I don't want to pay to keep these people alive.  They're in prison also.  I don't care how much it costs.  When are we going to start killing people?  Amen.  We have a death penalty in New York, and we don't use it.  These people are.  And you know what?  When they brought that down and said, we're going to finally get the death penalty in New  York, everyone's like, oh, finally.  And I'm sitting there like, what a crock of ass. 
[02:32:00]  They won't kill anyone in our lifetime.  Ain't going to happen.  I know.  Well, thank you.  It won't happen with this girl, either.  She won't even be up on it.  I know.  You know why?  They, first of all, have to determine if the kid was alive first.  And from the state of the body, I don't know how they're going to figure that  one out.  The difference doesn't make it.  She threw it to a dog.  She said it was stillborn.  Oh, please.  If it was stillborn, it's not murder.  She was just feeding her dog with what happened to be around at the time.  I'm not saying there's not other crimes there, but if it was stillborn, it's not a murder. 
[02:32:30]  I think they could tell from the blood if it breathed or not.  I think we finally found a girl for our contest.  Yes.  And we want to play it the real way.  Oh, God.  Thanks, Nicole.  Thanks.  Sean, what's going on?  I just want to say that not only should this girl burn in hell, but any attorney that's  going to defend her should be hung by his yam bag as well.  Someone will defend her.  Hey, where's the daddy?  Thanks, Sean.  Where's the daddy in all this? 
[02:33:00]  She keeps a pregnancy from her mom.  There's a sharp woman because she was ill.  Put down the crack pipe.  Jesus Christ.  Dan, I can't even read the rest of the details.  It's that insane in the paper today.  Let me see.  Let me see.  La-de-da-da.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Let's see. 
[02:33:30]  Lieutenant found in the icy, muddy yard a pit bull Rottweiler mix.  There you go.  Because one isn't just good enough.  You've got to mix both of them.  No, I read that part already.  Gnawing on the corpse?  Yeah.  Okay.  At first, he thought it was a doll.  I'm going to report to Obey and Anthony.  What do you want to say to me?  Let's just listen.  They were talking about how that little girl who had a baby out the window  to a hungry dog waiting in the yard.  Hello? 
[02:34:00]  We're going to talk to Phil next, Anthony.  Yeah.  He has a comment about this story.  But continue.  All right, it's on to us.  Phil.  Hello?  Hey, Phil, you jerk-off.  What's up?  I'm sorry, man.  What's going on?  Nothing.  I got a hungry dog here.  I could go find this little girl, and I'll feed it to my dog.  This girl, she's definitely burning hell for what she did. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  You know?  Terrible.  It's nothing to make fun of, but, you know.  Well, that's obvious, but nothing's going to happen to her, really.  Yeah, you don't think so?  Not really.  Yeah, I don't know.  No, nothing will happen.  They'll make her like, oh, the poor girl, look what happened.  How old was this, Dick?  Sixteen.  Oh, man.  Thank you.  There's someone that feels for the girl.  I got to give Mike's take on this.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Right.  You weren't there.  How do you know what actually happened?  You're going to accuse this girl of doing this stuff left and right. 
[02:35:00]  If you're saying what she did is actual fact, which is not because you weren't there.  I wasn't there.  Okay?  Just like everybody, my mentality is ready to accuse somebody.  Mike.  If the child was born, stillborn.  All right.  If the child was born, stillborn.  You've got a 16-year-old, doesn't know what to do.  She was scared.  She hid it.  And you know what?  You've got a dead baby there.  She doesn't know what to do with it.  So she put it in a garbage can, let's just say, which is probably what she did.  Okay?  Now you've got a dog.  A dog goes through garbage cans left and right all the time.  It's still right.  No, you don't.  You told me. 
[02:35:30]  You told me.  I believe him.  Mike, it's still wrong.  Right or wrong, but still, you've got a 16-year-old girl who doesn't know any better.  He hears what the lawyer's going to say.  And if the kid, exactly.  This is her lawyer right here.  And if the kid throws a stillborn child in the garbage, which does happen.  Stillborn babies happen all the time.  Okay?  You've got a mob mentality now that you want to throw around.  Mike, Mike.  He's burned his girl, killed his girl.  This mother effers in law school.  Mike, you're in law school, aren't you?  Negative.  Not at all.  No, you should be.  You sound like one of those scum-sucking pigs.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  You know what?  They'll be able to tell from tissue samples and blood if the kid was alive when that happened. 
[02:36:00]  Fireman said, at first I thought it was a doll.  It was too terrible to think it was a baby.  Murphy said rescuers use fire tools to subdue the dog.  Fire tools?  This guy is really pissed at you.  What's the problem?  Rob, what's up?  I hit an all-time low today.  What's the problem?  You hit an all-time low and you made me laugh.  I'll see that.  That is disgusting. 
[02:36:30]  Now you feel bad for laughing?  I feel bad for laughing at your puppy-child humor.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  I can't.  All right, Rob.  I've got to go to church this weekend.  Don't laugh.  Go ahead, Anthony.  So they used fire tools on it to loosen its jaws and sprayed mace on it to loosen its jaws from the baby's body.  Ouch.  Unfortunately, the infant was dead already. 
[02:37:00]  Unfortunately.  That would have been a nice life.  Not only is your mom a friggin' 16-year-old whore bag that threw you to a dog, but you somehow lived through it and now you're Frankenstein.  Now you're deformed and the kids made fun of you at school.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up, Anthony?  Relax with that.  Come on.  I don't know what I'm more pissed off, but you were that moron, Mike, that just called.  I hope both of you get hit in the butt by a Rottweiler and a pimple.  Doug, you're from Springfield?  Yeah.  What's Springfield?  New Jersey.  Oh, New Jersey. 
[02:37:30]  Okay.  I love Springfield.  Thank you.  Eye for an eye.  We should throw that girl against it with a dog now.  All right.  If a dog needs none.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Mm-hmm.  Neighbors in the building said she was a quiet girl devoted to caring for her mother  and raising her six-year-old sister.  Not a violent person.  She's a good girl.  That's what they always say.  It's never like, God, what a C word this one was.  Mary Jane.  Hi.  How are you?  Pretty good.  That one fellow that called and said that she didn't know what she was doing. 
[02:38:00]  Well, she knew what she was doing when she laid down and spread her legs.  Nice.  Now it's hot.  It's not hot.  It's disgusting.  And, you know, the death penalty is really too good for her.  I think throwing her into a pack of wild, hungry dogs would be just what she deserves.  Unfortunately, we don't do that.  Oh, no, we don't.  We're so liberal.  A liberal lawyer will save her tail.  You know.  We'll have to run in for her.  It's disgraceful.  It's horrible.  They think kids are disposable.  Yes.  Well, some are.  They're like they pop out of a Pez dispenser. 
[02:38:30]  The poor dog.  They kept the dog half starved in the back, chained up in the cold and everything.  Well, three animals the same way.  And now, yeah.  And, well, you know, this animal is dead.  They're just going to kill it.  Of course.  And all it was doing was, hey, here's some meat.  I'm hungry.  This is her only child?  Does she have other children?  A six-year-old.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Oh, a six-year-old.  Well, look what we're dealing with.  No, she doesn't.  She's got a six-year-old sister.  Oh, really?  And no other children.  The mother's kind of incapacitated.  Oh, it's always come from a bad environment. 
[02:39:00]  I'm so sick of that.  Oh, the bad environment thing?  Yeah, yeah.  The bad environment.  The ghetto.  There are 8,000 things the lawyer is going to say to get her off of this whole thing.  It's just so wrong.  It's so wrong.  You know, and the death penalty, as you said.  How many people have been put to death in New York since it came into existence?  I mean, the one in Jersey at least had the common decency to throw her in a girls' room.  The garbage pail.  I mean, you know, there's so many ways to get rid of a child.  People have to be dying.  Huh? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Feed her to a dog.  How about adoption?  It's funny because I don't know her.  Oh, unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Adoption.  No, no.  You know what works in this case?  What?  The death penalty.  Exactly.  Exactly.  But, you know, how much more evidence do I have to have to put a person to death?  Put a person, you know, give a person a death penalty.  How much more proof do I have to have of what she did?  You will not see the death penalty used in our lifetime.  Thank you.  I mean, the kid may have been stillborn, but still, it's still a human being. 
[02:40:00]  No, if it was stillborn, then it's not a murder.  Then it's not murder, of course.  Of course.  Well, you know, that's what the lawyer will say, and that'll be the end of it.  Yep.  All right, Mary Jane, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  You guys are terrific.  Steve got this all wrong.  Steve is saying Jesse Jackson's the father, and we can't even say that on the air.  Would you stop?  Carolyn, what's going on?  Hey, well, I guess we found something that teen doesn't sound good in front of, which  is teen infanticide.  No, it's kind of hot now.  Oh, is it?  No.  You sick ass. 
[02:40:30]  All right, thanks, Carol.  Bye.  Bye.  Well, that one in Jersey was kind of good.  Remember that story?  Went to her prom.  She's in the prom dress, and she was pregnant.  Went to the bathroom, had the kid, put it in the garbage pail.  And continued dancing and said, where's the punch?  She did, basically.  And then, you know what happened to her?  Not much.  That's it.  She's out.  She's been a couple years, right?  They're out.  Yeah, well, that's because they get into court, and then the lawyers say that it was a horrible  thing, but they were so young and so confused, and it's everyone's fault, but theirs. 
[02:41:00]  Right.  And that's the same thing.  They'll do this.  It's the dog's fault for being so hungry and having those big effing teeth.  Dave, what's going on?  Big pumpkin.  Yeah, listen, I'm a truck driver.  I deliver to all these prisons all the time.  These people live the life of luxury in there, you know?  And also, the death penalty.  Listen to this.  They get lethal injection.  What is that?  You know, it's gotten to the point we can't even kill people the right way.  You know, I deliver to Sing Sing and I think that's where they keep old Sparky. 
[02:41:30]  That was the electric chair.  Old Sparky.  Yeah.  That's the way to do it, man.  If you're going to kill someone, we want flames shooting out the top of their head.  That's right.  Boy, what porn out of the day we is.  We feel so guilty, we can't even kill people the right way.  That's exactly right.  No one feels a thing with that.  You know something?  That's right.  Well, I'm the bad guy today.  I'm going to say something else that might not be, people might not like to hear.  But I believe it's true.  There was a woman a few weeks back, got attacked in the hallway, ripped apart, and killed by a dog. 
[02:42:00]  Two dogs.  No one, people were outraged, but it wasn't like this.  Oh my God, it's an infant.  Do you remember when you were born and a few minutes old?  Do you remember that?  I don't either.  I think it's worse for that woman that lived a whole frigging life and getting ripped apart  by a dog.  What's the baby thing?  Wow, this kind of sucks.  And then you're gone again.  You weren't there.  You weren't there.  Then you're there.  It's like the first person that gets knocked out a dodgeball real quick. 
[02:42:30]  All right, start the game.  Boom.  Oh, the fat guy's out.  And you leave.  It's like you didn't even get to enjoy the game.  How much pot?  The kid didn't get to really enjoy the game.  How much pot did you smoke before the show?  I smoked no pot, but I'm saying.  You're absolutely insane.  I think it's worse for the woman that's been there and lived a life.  Smoke weed every day.  It is for a baby who doesn't know Christ.  The baby doesn't even have a gauge of pain yet.  These are the type of conversations you have when you're really, really wasted.  The baby doesn't have a gauge of fear or anything yet. 
[02:43:00]  It just has instinct, which we don't even know because the baby has no way to communicate  that.  So for a second, it comes out of the womb, right?  The mama goes, I'm tired of this baby, throws it out the window.  All of a sudden, the baby hits the ground and goes, what was that?  I don't know.  I'm a baby.  Then this big monster comes over with huge teeth and starts eating you.  You're still like, all right, I'm up for this.  It's life, I guess.  Anthony?  You have nothing to really base it on.  As an adult, you're like, ah!  You lose your mind. 
[02:43:30]  Anthony?  Yeah.  Were you partying with Christopher from The Sopranos?  I said it might not be a popular thing.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This happens to be one of my favorite shows.  I wanted to listen and learn.  I learned that from my ride home, I'm going to wear the pants because I think that your  show's so funny, I'm going to pee myself every day.  That's another goal we have.  Everybody wetting their pants on their drive home.  That's a dumb.  Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this? 
[02:44:00]  1027 WNEW.  Mr. Han.  I lean for Brooklyn's all mad at us, Opie.  And you?  Well, it's us.  It's our show, right?  Opie and Anthony.  No matter what goes over the airway.  You know what?  Yeah.  You're right.  All right.  Because usually I'm in your seat, taking the heat for what you say, and people say that  you're sick. 
[02:44:30]  I was just speaking my mind.  I think it's a lot more horrible for a grown woman to be ripped apart by a dog than it is  a baby.  It goes down to the cute thing again.  You know why we only kill the ugly animals and eat them.  There's no otter stakes.  Because otters are cute.  Just like Dennis Leary said.  So like old grandma and her old taint getting ripped up by a dog by a pit bull.  People go, ah, well.  But baby, you do anything to a baby, people freak out. 
[02:45:00]  Eileen from Brooklyn.  I'm a 30-year-old female from Brooklyn, New York.  I have to say I am totally disgusted by the way you're poking fun at this.  Good story.  I'm not poking fun.  We're giving our own take on it.  I'm giving my opinion on it.  Poking fun at the story of the baby who was killed by the dog.  You are a disgrace to radio talk shows everywhere.  Well, at least we can agree somewhere.  My husband's a fan of your show, and I absolutely refuse now to let your show be heard in the  house.  Great. 
[02:45:30]  Now, Eileen, your husband's going to say you're a bitch because you're not letting him do  what he wants to do.  He wants to listen to us in the house.  You say no.  What do you think?  He gets pissed at O&A?  No, he gets pissed at you.  I'm very insulted and find you inappropriate.  I will pass this on to all my friends.  Your friends probably don't listen to you either.  Make sure people know how despicable you are.  You haven't heard the end of this story.  Oh, Eileen, a little hanging thread at the end of that. 
[02:46:00]  Hmm?  Hmm?  How about a fresca?  You haven't heard the end of this.  That's a thread.  That's probably what her husband says, too, when he thinks the argument's over.  You haven't heard the end of it.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right.  That means at three in the morning.  Three in the morning.  You're going to wake me up to continue this.  Poke you with the finger.  Bunk, bunk, bunk.  And another thing.  Can we move on to what did we learn?  Sure.  All right.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, guys. 
[02:46:30]  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, want to tell you what I learned?  Yeah.  Life's just a game of dodgeball.  Yeah.  Some people stay in for the long haul.  Some people get taken out right away.  That's it.  Don't get hit in the ass.  Sundication.  All right.  Sundication.  Here we go, Anthony.  Ollie from New York.  That bitch deserves to fry.  Not even Norton can support this type of behavior.  Angela from Dubbrox.  Today I learned Black Girl actually still watches Miami Vice.  I learned that Louis Black isn't as quick with the acronyms as Jay Moore. 
[02:47:00]  I learned all weathermen should die of AIDS.  I learned that metal music makes you want to knock an Iraqi off his camel.  And I also learned that feeding babies to dogs is nothing more than thinning the herd.  My God.  I didn't say that.  Stye from Queens.  I learned today airline pillows too small for baby suffocation.  Yeah.  I learned Anthony has to work on his Jedi mind trick.  God, I'll get that down one of these days.  Damon from Babylon.  I learned today movie rental, $4, a 12-pack of beer, $10. 
[02:47:30]  Jay Moore as a transvestite killer, priceless.  Philip Michael Thomas as a role model for Earl.  What was the name of that movie?  Cherry.  Cherry Falls?  Falls.  A Jay Moore bomb.  He admitted it.  He said it.  Not us.  You make your own jokes, people.  Tuna from Queens.  Today I learned bras are less sexier than panties.  Yeah, I'm not even going anywhere with that, Rick.  But Rick looks at me and I knew what he's thinking. 
[02:48:00]  I was thinking the same thing.  It's a little figured of on instant, I'm sure.  Sick bunch of bastards out there that they are.  Today I learned four never gets used in an acronym.  God, help me out.  Write down what you were...  Now I'm like totally distracted.  Write down.  Let me go to Steve.  Steve, what's going on?  I'm hanging on. 
[02:48:30]  You're on.  Let's go.  Oh, what's happening?  I just learned today that I want to drive myself off the road into a tree because I realized  coming home that I totally agree with Anthony's position and that is sick.  Later.  All right, thank you.  Anthony, throwing a picture.  Vinny, what's going on?  What's up, fellas?  I learned that time travel is possible.  You just got to give a stack or two to Lewis Black.  Oh.  Later, fellas.  Thank you.  You're insane. 
[02:49:00]  That's why I didn't say it.  You're insane.  John, what's going on?  What's up, ONA?  Hey.  I learned that an S-cord in Aspen cost $3,000.  Yes.  Take it easy, guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Jay.  This has been an effed up show today.  Jay, what's going on?  It's very dark.  I think it's the storm of the century.  It got to us.  Jay.  Well, I learned two things.  One, I learned that dingo really can eat your baby.  And the other thing I learned is I'm taking the express to hell because I was laughing  my ass off when you played the New York clip.  I almost hit some idiot out in the driveway shoving those snow away. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  Average New Yorker checking in, Anthony.  Yeah.  God damn it, you racist Fs.  What?  When will you show some basic effing shred of human compassion?  Oh, my.  Specifically you, you racist scumbag, Anthony.  Some kids are disposable.  What kind of kids are those?  Thinning the herd?  The kid didn't ask for this S.  The 16-year-old scumbag should be killed just like the 14-year-old scumbag who shut 
[02:50:00]  up his school should be killed.  The kid deserved a life even if he's black or would have grown up poor.  Hey, hey, hey.  You effing scumbag.  I never brought color into this discussion, ass.  Holy smoke.  The only person I brought up was the one from Jersey.  She was white.  I'm not bringing color up.  I'm saying it's thin in the herd, you jackass.  What do you think?  That kid would have grown up to have been a respectable person in society?  Doubtful.  Possible? 
[02:50:30]  Sure.  Doubtful.  I think average New Yorker assumed that it was a black baby.  Look at what a piece of crap our mother raised.  Laying on the couch.  What?  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  I learned Dykes have been around for 90 years.  Yes.  See you later.  Dykes Lumber, our brand new client.  Dykes Lumber.  I'm serious.  What is Siobhan going to say?  Siobhan, what's up?  Siobhan.  Siobhan.  Close enough. 
[02:51:00]  How the hell do you get a name like that?  It's an Irish name and you don't want to know the spelling because it'll scare you.  Spell it.  Now we need to know.  Yeah.  No, I can't tell you.  You don't know how to spell?  No, I do know how to spell.  S-H-A-I-B-O-N.  And it's horrible.  Wow.  So it's pronounced Siobhan.  Blame the Irish.  And blame my mom.  Okay.  So I learned today that the girl from Bed-Stuy could sell her new recipe for kibbles and  bits to items.  I guess they can make a lot of money on it.  I'm sorry.  I really am upset.  You shocked me.  You shocked me.  I really am upset.  And can you do me a favor? 
[02:51:30]  Oh, my God.  I almost lost my cookie when you played the smoke weed every day thing.  Pretty funny.  You've got to play that one more time before you guys sign up.  All right.  We'll do that.  All right.  Thanks.  She's requesting a two-second bit.  Smoke weed every day.  All right.  Josh, this could be the worst thing that's ever written on Instant Feedback.  It says Jim Norton, but I don't think it's him.  I agree with Anthony about babies.  They don't know what's going on.  That's why I have sex with them.  Jesus. 
[02:52:00]  I've had it.  Enough.  I'm done today.  Buck, what's going on?  You guys are insane.  Yeah.  Yo, Ken Stevens is a sexist.  Yeah.  All right.  Later, guys.  Thank you.  We'll quit every day.  Guess who's on the line?  She's finally checking in.  Erin.  Hi, this is Erin, and I learned that I'm not the only one with a rape fantasy.  Yeah, well, we can't do anything about it.  We can't play run around park for Erin.  Well, later, guys.  All right.  Bye.  There she is, the girl that started it all, just in case she was made up. 
[02:52:30]  I can't read that.  I want more babies back then.  I want more babies back then.  She lives baby back then.  Get in my belly.  Get in my belly.  See, it's funny in a movie.  You look like a baby.  Today, I learned that Ken just arrived at LaGuardia. 
[02:53:00]  That's awful.  I learned that Master of Puppets will be the battle cry of our troops in World War III.  Average New Yorker checking back in, Anthony.  Ah, F it.  I apologize.  I love you guys. 
[02:53:30]  That can't be him.  He was really pissed.  Jason, what's going on?  Yo.  Hey.  I learned a couple of things today.  Yeah.  Let's see.  George W. attacked Iraq out of Revenge of his father.  Mm-hmm.  He carries the people who just don't have it.  Mm-hmm.  You two are forming your own militia.  Mm-hmm.  And it takes Louis Black two weeks to get a couch.  Very good.  Very good.  He picked up a lot of things.  You know, I already listened to it. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  Thanks, Jason.  Bye.  Byron from Newark.  I learned that Anthony was smoking weed before the show with Christopher from The Sopranos.  I learned that Stinky is not as hot as Aaron.  Everyone's saying you smoked AK-47 before the show.  Got that.  I learned Anthony gets wood from Dykes.  There you go.  Lots of great instant feedback from you guys. 
[02:54:30]  Thank you.  Yeah.  Let's get the hell out of here.  Yeah.  My God.  This has been a very, very disturbing day on the Opie and Anthony show.  Very disturbing.  Another pair of tickets to the Jerry Red Wilson Comedy Benefit featuring Jim Brewer, Louis Black, Adam Farrar, and others.  It's happening this coming Tuesday at Town Hall in Times Square.  We're all going, or a lot of us are going.  Tickets available now through Ticketmaster, 212-307-4100.  Or Ticketmaster.com. 
[02:55:00]  We got a pair of tickets to a random caller right now at 212-757-1027.  Yes, Anthony?  I also want to thank the fine people from MafiaMob.com for my flowers.  I hope that doesn't mean a prelude to a whacking.  I don't want to get whacked yet.  Just getting in, and I hear I might be in line.  You got flowers.  What the hell are you going to do with those?  They're like five feet tall.  They're huge.  Those are the ones they send to the people that get whacked.  You can't do anything with those flowers. 
[02:55:30]  All right.  I might be getting bumped up.  That's what I'm hearing.  People are talking.  I'm hearing.  We'll get some info tomorrow, okay?  All right, man.  Thanks, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  This is not the Discovery Channel.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The movies and wacko show. </pre>
