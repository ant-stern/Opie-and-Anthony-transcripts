<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a critical discussion of Barack Obama's response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  Opie and Anthony focused on the perceived lack of concrete action and specific plans, repeatedly questioning "how" the administration intended to address the crisis. They compared Obama's declining approval ratings unfavorably to George W. Bush's during Hurricane Katrina.  The segment also included a caller from New Orleans criticizing Obama's language, a humorous digression on classic Hollywood actors' physiques, banter with several callers, brief coverage of the World Cup (including vuvuzelas and a fake football score), and a caller's Bigfoot sighting story (reported by CNN).  Patrice O'Neal was mentioned as an upcoming guest.

The show transitioned to jokes about Bigfoot roadkill and a supposed leprechaun sighting in Mobile, Alabama, before discussing Perez Hilton's legal issues.  A significant portion focused on a video of a Seattle police officer punching a Black woman. Opie, Anthony, and a caller, Keith (a Detroit police officer), debated the justification of the officer's actions, analyzing the video's cuts and the woman's behavior.  The discussion explored racial implications and selective editing in news coverage, broadening to include other instances of police encounters caught on camera, particularly those involving Black women. Patrice O'Neal joined the show, offering commentary and jokes. The segment also touched upon President Obama's perceived lack of authority and underlying racial tensions in the US,  included a comedic anecdote about a hot dog line, a vintage James Cagney film clip (grapefruit incident), a Shirley Temple clip, and promotion for Patrice O'Neal's stand-up shows.

The next segment covered the NBA playoffs (Celtics vs. Lakers), the prevalence of neck tattoos in the NBA (attributing it to players like Allen Iverson and Dennis Rodman), and a scathing critique of soccer.  The hosts discussed Al Gore's divorce, speculating on infidelity involving Larry David's ex-wife, and shared angry accounts of frustrating customer service experiences.  Patrice O'Neal, present in the studio, contributed significantly, sharing anecdotes about his own customer service interactions.  Notable moments included vulgar commentary on NBA players, profane dissection of soccer, and detailed accounts of poor customer service.  A breaking news story about a state trooper shooting was briefly mentioned.

The final segment heavily featured a discussion about negative stereotypes of Asian people, particularly Chinese and Indian individuals. The hosts and callers used highly offensive and racist language, sharing anecdotal experiences relating to customer service, allegations of spitting, and comments about physical attributes.  Specific incidents discussed included finding hair in food, a woman breaking her hip in a Chinese restaurant, and cultural differences in humor and politeness.  The conversation also included discussion of the video game *Red Dead Redemption* and the announcement that Executive Producer Steve Carlisi had come out as gay.

[00:02:30]  that was the my major observation and then what he was saying it's like oh it all sounds great but  how the fuck are we gonna do that and people need to know how the fuck are we gonna just blow off  fossil fuels and go with alternative energy sounds like a great idea it didn't work for a lot of  fucking presidents that came before him including what uh good old jimmy carter was the main one  jimmy carter you know when you get on uh tv and start talking about uh during this um disaster they  got going on in the gulf and you use it as a great opportunity to drum up another tax a fucking 
[00:03:00]  carbon tax he wants to just tack have an energy tax more tax tax tax stop it already would you  and he and then even msnbc which he can go there and they will just lap his ass sure uh even they  were like yeah yeah they didn't i'm not feeling this one not many people were feeling the speech  last night you know i mean i'm i'm more of an obama guy than anthony although yeah well 
[00:03:30]  anybody would be although not as much the clan is although not as much as i was you know a year  and a half ago same thing you look at the polls uh they say the same thing a lot of people aren't  as much obama people as they used to be but i'm i'm about the people and i i want to see a personality  on the guy and you don't see it personal he's like a robot people's livelihoods are getting  completely destroyed in the gulf and there he is just reading some shit last night he's another one of  these presidents that wanted to run for president but then to be president is uh a whole nother story 
[00:04:00]  he was very good at running for president and then uh now he's having a little bit of difficulty  in the job of president see his hair it's just turning gray by by the day right it's more and  more gray by the day he needs some of that oil from the gulf and just splatter it in his hair and  cover that up just pop it on because it's uh oof i was not impressed with the speech i mean we got  some quick highlights if you want to go over them highlights low lights right highlights and what 
[00:04:30]  are they saying man up to 65 000 barrels of crude oil is being spilled into the into the gulf i've  heard so many every hour or something like that or no every day every day millions a day and i don't  fucking know and they could only collect 10 000 gallons a day they can't 10 or 15 000 gallons a  day so there's still still 20 to 40 000 gallons of uh oil being there have some problems and now 
[00:05:00]  it's hurricane season man this is this is oily hurricane oil hurricane come on come on his uh  disapproval rating on how uh they've handled how he's handled personally whatever this crisis yeah is  the same as um george bush's was for katrina okay so and if you remember wow his wasn't very good  no no not at all like a 52 or 53 disapproval rating on how he's dealing with this you know what we 
[00:05:30]  might as well go right down to where it's uh you know sort of the ground zero this one mike in new  orleans mike good morning mike how you doing what's up mikey man you guys have had a hell of a run down  there huh yeah it's been pretty interesting man over the last five years but i couldn't hope  help but notice last night that uh obama during his speech referred to uh us people here at the  gulf coast region as america's neighbors america's neighbors all that horse shit you're just the 
[00:06:00]  neighbors you don't live here right all that all that feel good shit just fucking talk no one talks  like that oh he's talking about america's neighbors he's talking about world war ii how you know oh  people weren't sure if we'd be able to come up with the planes and tanks that we would need to fight a  war that and it's like wow what what are you what are you bringing up and talking about landing man on  the moon this is capping an oil thing clean up the oil clean the fucking oil up you know they went 
[00:06:30]  right down to new orleans after the speech and people down there the the leaders what the the parish  leaders that that's strange to me what's what what's that about parish they got some weird system  down there it's old they have many many parishes and then each parish has a leader and they were  talking to a few parish leaders yeah and they're saying look we're just not seeing the equipment  on the ground down here we're not seeing the people pretty please with sugar on it right clean  the fucking oil how about we get all the equipment down here and how about we get all the fucking 
[00:07:00]  people down here and then and then we'll start feeling a little better the oil is is pouring into the  marshlands right now let's not start sucking each other's dicks just yet gentlemen uh yeah  msnbc a couple of the guys were talking about um chris matthews probably yeah mobilizing a shitload  of people how about some of his uh the people that voted for him and and and give a a very um i don't  know uh one of these speeches that kind of motivate people to to want to volunteer and go down there and 
[00:07:30]  clean the beaches thousands of people no one gives a fuck i got an answer to that because keith  i'm an asshole oberman told me why oh yeah he says that bp is preventing uh that from happening  because they don't want all the all the video uh being released of people wearing you know gas masks  and whatnot to clean up the oil and because that's toxic as well right and obama uh was supported now is  that true or not i don't know bp was a big obama supporter a lot of his policies they've supported 
[00:08:00]  and um you know i think obama's a little slow on the draw with these guys well he kind of showed  him last night and yeah another fucking he's finding an ass to kick i was really impressed where's the  ass where's the ass that he was going to kick what happened what happened i might have to send him  another tweet yes look out everyone left my my tweet alone because i think they're scared  oh really a little they're scared of the visit you didn't want yeah you don't want to visit we're 
[00:08:30]  all scared of the visit no even though supposedly we visit supposedly we live in a democracy but  whenever whenever you kind of trash a politician you're scared of the visit yeah just walking home  whistling a happy tune next thing you know you're in a van the black van pulls up and throws you in  bunch of guys with little headphones and lapel buttons then they're reading the tweet back to me  yeah did you say last night oh but what i meant what no what you meant doesn't matter sir right 
[00:09:00]  no it's a democracy right yeah you freedom of speech and somebody doesn't like it i dipped into my  politics a little bit last night but now i'm back out aunt i'm back out that's it i can't deal with  the bullshit that that that you see every day with these politicians in general yeah in general i like  to speak more in general than yeah this was self this is uh one of those situations where it's not  quite pure politics it's you know an oil spill mixed with politics and i i don't know well you know it's 
[00:09:30]  not like i said look i'm not sitting here blaming barack obama for the uh oil spill it's not his fault  um it's just he's not and he's being criticized by his own supporters he's not and hasn't been very  presidential and we're 55 56 days and how many how many freaking days we're in the mid 50s and and  he's just really starting to uh get riled up about this thing at the beginning he really didn't do 
[00:10:00]  anything he didn't even mention it and now it's kind of like ah maybe you should have looked a little  more presidential well why don't we hit a couple highlights from the speech you know already this oil  spill is the worst environmental disaster america has ever faced and unlike an earthquake it's like  he's doing a book report already this oil spill is the worst disaster that it's such a staccato 
[00:10:30]  weird speech pattern listen how his sentences end face yeah that's how you used to do it in  fucking school when you're doing book reports yeah america has ever faced faced and unlike an  earthquake or a hurricane it's not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days  the millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the gulf of mexico are more like an epidemic  one that we will be fighting for months and even years but make no mistake oh make we will fight 
[00:11:00]  this spill with everything we've got for as long as it takes great we will make bp pay for the damage  their company has caused and we will do whatever is necessary to help the gulf coast and its people  recover from this tragedy you could you could uh interpret that as blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  because when i'm listening to these speeches i sit there at home and go how how yeah how how 
[00:11:30]  once you have the job you can't just make campaign promises you know those are like campaign promises  right we will do this we will do this all right how are you gonna do it exactly he gave us no hows  there how are you gonna do it how there was at least three or four hows in that 40 uh second clip  were you chatting with the bp people what what what's the timeline um did you did you give them a  deadline before uh the military goes in and uh army corps of engineers and and they start doing the 
[00:12:00]  job and billing british petroleum for it or like anything i would love to hear anything from him  that here is what we're doing and here's the timeline for it correct talk about oh we we came up with  weapons in world war ii uh we came up with a way to get a man on the moon yeah kennedy said it in the  fucking uh like 61 and we did it in uh 69 yeah well we had a solid eight years there i don't think 
[00:12:30]  in between the famous fucking statement i don't think we could take eight years of oil pouring into  the gulf how about a timeline here well there were a lot of unanswered fucking questions there man a lot  of house how is that gonna be done you're gonna get a lot more volunteers now how are you doing this  what's gonna happen are we getting other nations and their rigs into the gulf are the are they are  they there oh rigs all right he he's he's always about uh just cash like all right we're gonna oh 
[00:13:00]  we're gonna get british petroleum and have them pay it's like all right yeah believe me i think they  know they're gonna have to pay for this i think that i don't think they're gonna finally you know  at some point cap it and go all right our job here is done as as uh you know crude is is pouring  onto the beaches well that's the next clip here making uh bp pay yes and as you listen to these clips  just just to yourself how yeah you'll know when to say how in your own brain tomorrow i will meet  with the chairman of bp and inform him that he is to set aside whatever resources are required 
[00:13:30]  to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company's  recklessness and this fund will not be controlled by bp in order to ensure that all legitimate claims  are paid out in a fair and timely manner the account must and will be administered by an  independent third party great to say that but is uh bp agreeing to this you know what that is going  to be in courts for years right because they're insured they are insured right and they're going 
[00:14:00]  to say look we paid for insurance for this and whatever the insurance company can dole out that's  what they're fucking gonna pay like we're not we're not liable for this you know as far as uh  personally they just ah they're insured fuck it and you can inform anyone of anything he just did  as a matter of fact he goes tomorrow i'll be informed that's what i mean bp guy was watching yeah 
[00:14:30]  oh shit i'm gonna inform that's great yeah he knows now that's wonderful believe me i think he knows  uh you want to continue with this just the highlights of course i want to hire a little  of a barack and then the phones are just fucking lit barry few months ago i approved a proposal to  consider new limited offshore drilling under the assurance that it would be absolutely safe  that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precautions would be taken  that obviously was not the case in the deep white uh deep water horizon rig and i want to know why 
[00:15:00]  the american people deserve to know why the families i met with last week who lost their loved ones  in the explosion these families deserve to know why and so i've established a national commission  to understand the causes of this disaster commission and offer recommendations on what additional  safety and environmental standards we need to put in place already i've issued a six-month moratorium 
[00:15:30]  on deep water drilling good i know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs  does it but for the sake of their safety and for the sake of the entire region we need to know the facts  before we allow deep water drilling to continue and while i urge the commission to complete its work  as quickly as possible i expect they're known for that that work thoroughly and impartially  do you understand how many billions upon billions upon billions and i could keep going of barrels of 
[00:16:00]  oil have been pumped out of offshore oil rigs with nary an accident uh it happens he's talking about you  know and i will not have this happen unless we have assurances that it is safe uh completely safe and  it's it's it's a thing where you do have accidents and accidents are usually caused by someone's  negligence but they're still considered accidents that i don't i'm sure they didn't want this to 
[00:16:30]  happen yeah uh did they cut some corners i don't know all the details but you you can't take a single  case and knee-jerk it into let's put more people out of work oh really let's fucking do uh uh make it  make it even more difficult to uh uh stop depending on foreign oil oh i thought you were gonna say more  difficult to do a radio show we see this happening in our business one guy fucks up yeah and everyone  and the fuck up i i have in quotations by the way because i don't think uh the dj fucks up and then 
[00:17:00]  it's a knee-jerk reaction and then everyone's not allowed to do that particular type of thing on the  radio anymore and and obama is following that exact same path he's politicizing this disaster  uh which i mean he really it's business as usual he shouldn't be politicizing it he shouldn't be  trying to uh get any of his agenda across based on this disaster he should be dealing with the disaster 
[00:17:30]  without trying to get his shit through enough yeah let me uh say hi to dan in jersey he knows a  little bit about the bp insurance thing uh dan hey guys how you doing pretty good buddy hey bp is  not insured unlike some people are kind of thinking right now they did a uh less than brilliant move a  couple years back and they decided to insure themselves instead so they set up some sort of  like crazy ass trust i forget how it was specifically set up they're not insured well if it was if they set 
[00:18:00]  it up themselves and it was approved then uh they're insured they're self-insured a lot of  people are saying good right right right they're self-insured but the thing is that it's not as if  you're litigating between two different parties and and it's going it's not as apt to be tied up in  the legal system as it would be if you're oh really yeah you watch i don't see a lot of i don't see a lot  the people in the well go ahead sorry i'm just saying you watch any situation like this is always 
[00:18:30]  going to be litigated for a long fucking time many years for a long time i don't see uh anybody  getting money anytime soon down there in the gulf bp regardless if there's an insurance company  involved either bp is going to be in court with the federal government uh when they try to force them  to do shit like pay off money or set up some kind of fucking uh escrow account to pay off uh the 
[00:19:00]  people that are hurt by this especially when this whole situation gets a little bit more under control  yeah oh yeah then people he's gonna be like what yeah right we'll fight this in court we'll see you  in court once they do cap this and uh clean it up a little bit little oily birds doesn't look as bad  right right right uh the news will go away away slightly all the cameras will go away the news  people go away and everyone's interest will go away and they'll just sit in court for a while  until there's a settlement of some sort and uh the people that get screwed are going to be the people 
[00:19:30]  that are have the fishing industry down there uh tourism beaches whatever restaurant owners  yeah they'll be the ones that get fucked and uh each side will have their talking head and it's just  come on we've seen this before with other shit give thou a break another clip from last night  one place we've already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and 
[00:20:00]  issuing permits known as the minerals management service good there you go over the last decade  this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility  a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police  themselves at this agency industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight oil companies  showered regulators with gifts and favors and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety 
[00:20:30]  inspections and write their own regulations ice when ken salazar became my secretary of the interior  one of his very first acts was to clean up the worst of the corruption at this agency  but it's now clear that the problem there ran much deeper and the pace of reform was just too slow  about five thousand feet deeper secretary salazar and i are bringing in new leadership at the agency  michael bromwich who was a tough federal prosecutor and inspector general that'll work and his charge 
[00:21:00]  for the next few months is to build an organization that acts as the oil industry's watchdog  oh more watchdogs more watchdogs and blue ribbon commissions and fucking this bullshit oh god this  guy i'm amazed anything gets done in washington nothing does i'm just amazed and obama knew all  this shit was going on before this of course he did you know everyone just looks the other way and  hopes something like this doesn't happen and then it does happen and then you got to react and change 
[00:21:30]  everything you know god this guy yeah about firing some people instead of just hiring a bunch of new  people well there's commissions and in the coming months we're gonna blah blah we'll have a committee  put together that will find these improprieties and we'll blah blah blah blah blah blah blah we're  gonna put together a commission to watch the commission yes and then they make sure they're  properly doing the commissioning thing but they're gonna be being watched by another commission right  and by the way there's another commission shh keep it under your hat let's say hi to tony in 
[00:22:00]  brooklyn tony hey guys good morning good morning tony i am so focused on the s s's and the way obama  whistles when he says the letter s i don't even i don't even hear the content of what he's saying i just  listen for the s and i go yeah he's got a gap in his teeth somewhere he's got too much air escaping  an oil problem they're leaking lots of oil that's from smoking so i thought he was supposed to quit 
[00:22:30]  smoking but probably all the stress of his job what a whistle comes from smoking maybe it's a  wheezing smoke and then a more than a tooth smoke no it's like a tooth decay or something  my aunt has it what are you saying what are you saying my aunt my aunt has it oh okay all right  well his auntie my auntie's got that uh oh you know there you go jimmy james new hampshire jimmy james 
[00:23:00]  morning boy hey hello hey i decided last night that i would let my 10 year old daughter stay up and  watch the presidential address because you know it's an educational thing is it educational all right  uh turned out no uh well at the end of it she looked at me completely straight face and she just  asked dad these people are stupid why can't we fire them and hire smarter people and all i could do  look at her and say honey i honestly don't know out of the mouth of babes it's yeah i mean it's so easy 
[00:23:30]  but we can't figure it out well you know boys yeah they they just can't figure this shit out man  i mean we gotta wait for that uh that other what that that that the relief well excuse me yeah yeah  to be drilled which is sometime in august i don't know are they drilling their asses off or are they  taking lunch breaks oh they better be fucking drilling like armageddon right like bruce willis on 
[00:24:00]  that asteroid they better fucking be drilling you think they're just working regular days or are they  fucking drilling there better not be one guy leaning on a shovel when someone comes and checks  that fucking sight what are you doing uh how about taking a break let's take a lunch how about a  lunch get in there and finally one more clip from obama's speech last night as we recover from this  recession the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of 
[00:24:30]  jobs millions but only if we accelerate that transition how are we doing that only if we  seize the moment how how and only if we rally together and act as one nation how workers and  entrepreneurs how scientists and citizens yeah the public and private sectors yeah was that when i was a  candidate for this office i laid out a set of principles that would move our country towards  energy independence what happened last year the house of representatives acted on these principles 
[00:25:00]  by passing a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill a bill that finally makes clean energy  the profitable kind of energy attack america's businesses now there are costs associated with  this transition all and there's some who believe that we can't afford those costs right now  i say we can't afford not to change how we produce and use energy you because long-term costs to our  economy to our national security and our environment are far greater yeah good for you yeah the cost 
[00:25:30]  again more more tax tax tax tax tax tax tax tax tax tax tax tax tax tax tax more babble five years ago  let's uh replay this audio yeah and we'll all realize not much uh changed from this huge disaster he's the  committee appointing guy and the let's just tax the shit out of uh the top two percent of the country  guy oh my god uh it's a blue ribbon commission and then this guy writes what the hell is a blue ribbon 
[00:26:00]  i know where's the blue ribbon what does it mean rhetoric is this some rhetoric just getting up there  using it to pass his little agendas and bullshit tired of it uh all right let's say hi to mike in  minnesota mike hey boys hi good morning mikey he's been handling the whole situation like a boob from the  start um there's no foreign ships in the gulf helping for starters because he turned down aid from the 
[00:26:30]  dutch when this first happened they've been turning down uh aid from foreign countries continuously with no  good explanation and unlike katrina when uh bush uh temporarily suspended the jones act which  prevented uh foreign ships from going from american port to american port it's a protectionist act  meant to uh protect union jobs if they he won't suspend that act he won't provide a good reason for  it and that's why there's no foreign ships helping us out right now even though people want to help us  out and you know as far as his suspending uh american operations drilling that's just putting 
[00:27:00]  american people out of there's there's chinese next door to the guys in the gulf continuously  drilling and they're not affected by any of the proclamation oh so the chinese get to continue  doing exactly what uh caused this disaster right yeah exactly the chinese cubans the venezuelans  people that aren't even in our hemisphere drilling in the gulf get the fucking dutch over here to help  us clean up this goddamn oil something right just just do something please my god i mean we make our 
[00:27:30]  jokes do something or nothing we make our jokes about this whole situation but jesus this is a bad  one don't just make it sound like you're doing nothing uh let me go to derrick in tennessee derrick  yeah obama last night said the reason why we have to drill 40 miles outside of and the water is  because there is no more oil on land to drill right well wait what about anwar north dakota montana 
[00:28:00]  but the environmentalist won't let us drill there who are all democrats so it's his own people stopping  him from drilling on land then this mess would have never happened yeah we can't drill anymore they shut  down all these refineries and and and then they just go well now we got to come up with alternate  fuel you know what we got some really good fuel it's called oil and until it completely runs out  that's the only time we're going to come up with something really viable when that last drop of oil 
[00:28:30]  comes out of the earth the next day you will see brilliant people come up with something that is  amazing and replaces oil and is as convenient uh as economical and um but until that day we got oil  fuck it or if the oil completely destroys the gulf yeah i mean completely big fucking just black  surface on top of the gulf don't forget about this energy oh the wind you like the wind you talked 
[00:29:00]  about wind turbines last night it's hard to fucking drive your car with a windmill on it we're building  wind turbines i like the wind turbines yeah they're cool yeah they they fucking generate power and shit  but you know what earl my friend one asshole on this feedback it doesn't think we should be talking  about this really this was a huge fucking speech for obama last night phones are fucking lit the  feedback is spinning i'm spinning to the point i can't even read it i want to apologize to that guy 
[00:29:30]  i want to send him uh let's send down to louisiana yeah exactly on vacation this kind of was a big one  for obama last night a big one i think he um he didn't come off as presidential as he should have  or could have no not like you said you know when you got a reagan in there reagan would have talked  to the people of the gulf yes yeah he would have fucking really gotten in there i'm swimming down myself  and kept that will bp cap that will exactly like he would have fucking done something you just see 
[00:30:00]  ronnie reagan with his bad in shape out of shape old man fucking body like in those swim trunks from  the 50s like charlton hesitant yeah the ape sucking in his gut and diving off a rock right i'll be right  back mommy i'm going down to that whale the whale whale whale whale you gotta move your head around

[00:44:00]  ronald reagan so i don't know man the oil continues to spill into that gulf and uh obama really didn't  give us much uh last night as far as what um what's gonna happen i heard commissions i heard  committees i heard new appointments um some more money is going to be needed uh he's going to find  an ass to kick over at bp um this is like world war ii and the moon landing and that's it and uh and  the oil still and wind power and wind power and how we got to stop but depending on foreign oil 
[00:44:30]  meanwhile this was our own oil but i think we i think we needed him to say starting tomorrow  yeah there's going to be whatever happening like something very concrete as far as the cleanup  goes not talking to the ceo bp or any of this other shit but starting tomorrow meaning today  i'm gonna have another 20 000 people down there helping you people out yeah fuckload of ships and  everything like getting yeah try to get the oil out of those marshes so marshes uh michael landon

[00:45:30]  james coburn the great names  uh fuck yeah uh and now people getting silly wilford brimley stop fatty arbuckle jackie gleason 
[00:46:00]  fatty arbuckle uh obama should use nasa engineers chuck in jersey is saying oh yeah i mean i yeah i'm in  agreement that they've never faced anything like this before so they don't know what the fuck to do  to stop this right and we have a lot of uh you know seems like we have a lot of resources a lot  of minds on the case a lot of minds and a lot of resources i think he's giving bp much too much time  to do this themselves much too much time to do this themselves this isn't any longer a company 
[00:46:30]  based disaster where the company is like we got it we could take care of it this is a disaster that's  affecting the united states its people uh food supply industry and and i think we need to use the  resources that this country has to go in there and start cleaning some shit up well we got kevin  costner clean it up didn't bp buy some kevin costner uh rigs i saw him uh on tv yesterday i didn't hear 
[00:47:00]  the sound but oh he was babbling babbling about his fucking invention i think they bought some of  them did they i think so i think that hit overnight now it's just so huge you heard about the congressman  right with the harry carrie oh yeah yeah he's a little uh this will wrap up oversensitive our sad  break for the morning the bp oil our sad oil break although we uh we worked in some in shape 
[00:47:30]  bad of shape old of course wonderful actors uh yeah that was why stephen basho is reminding us  bill burr's take on uh the actors back then uh it was like it was they were considered in shape if  they had a tan that's all they needed was a tan well tans do make you feel healthier right yes so  you got louisiana congressman joseph uh how do you say his last name cao i guess he's an asian guy 
[00:48:00]  i would say uh chow chow cow cow probably sting who knows but he had this to say  mr chairman the um oil disaster um has caused to meet you kind of great economic impact to my  district uh hundreds of businesses have closed and thousands out of work uh mr stern  asked mr k to resign well in the asian culture we do uh things differently during the samurai days 
[00:48:30]  we just give you a knife and uh ask you to uh commit hara kiri uh my constituents are still  debating how about doing what they want me to ask you to do but uh with that being said  the cleaning up process has been a disgrace the claims process has been dismal  and one week into the oil spill i approached bp about establishing a trust account and i received 
[00:49:00]  no response now that the president is asking you to establish an escrow account what would be your  response your response you know what also uh that is um so racist if that guy did something  and some other uh person got on mic and said you know something sir mr cow chow whatever your name 
[00:49:30]  is um i believe because of what you did you should uh do what asians did years ago uh take a knife  and commit hara kiri uh wow that guy would be fired a lot of people so fired completely fired  offended that guy would be like oh my god you're using uh a stereotype because just because i'm asian  i'm supposed to do that but he's able to say it with the impunity that's what just doesn't make  sense with all this crap it's we have so many racially based double standards that um will never be 
[00:50:00]  one um nation black people allowed to say the n-word white people aren't allowed to say the n-word  that's just well that's really allowed it's just what company are you in at the time  in general you're just not allowed to yeah it's pretty off limits but they use it like it's  nothing which they use it in a way where it doesn't have any power whatsoever but for some  reason when a white person says it there's a lot of power behind it yeah but the black community says  say so much that it has lost its power that word has lost its power nothing to it stop it's a goof 
[00:50:30]  word now all right enough we got patrice o'neal coming in today thank god i think jimmy's in  pittsburgh i think he's filming something for leno that's going to be on later on this summer  and then uh jimmy's going to be uh where next uh chicago right right right right right right so we  got uh patrice today and he should be here within the next half hour so he's got to be very well i was 
[00:51:00]  going to say he's got to be very happy but i guess he's not very happy because uh la yes to game  seven last night they certainly did they kicked the celtics oh sorry the black celtics the black  celtics uh got their a's is handed to him that's right and patrice is a big uh black celtics fan well  coming from uh boston right that area but we got a game seven holy shit this is fucking david stern's  got to be jerking off in his office today biggie you get game seven with uh the lakers and the celtics 
[00:51:30]  are you kidding me this is the this is the perfect scenario for for the nba and uh david stern they  plan all this in advance uh sometimes you wonder it you know it's like sometimes you wonder you're  like how could that happen sometimes you wonder about that there's a lot it seems to be a lot of  game sevens and what's going on with the vuvuzelas any any updates on the vuvuzelas there are vuvuzela  updates i have uh some personally uh and um uh there's uh somebody working on getting it taken 
[00:52:00]  out of the broadcasts they're trying to filter it out filter it out why don't they put the  announcers in some kind of booth i guess you want the ambient noise you're gonna need the sound of  the game you're right crowd noise how are they gonna filter it out with magical programs and  equalizers that cancel out the vuvuzela sound i know it's quite amazing quite amazing at this point  don't you want to hear the vuvuzelas if you're watching world cup i wasn't watching world cup 
[00:52:30]  but now you're watching i came home and it was on i have a lot i had a lot of people at my house  yesterday uh doing work and whatnot right and uh ang was over there uh and she apparently is into it  she's into the world cup i don't know because it was on so i wasn't going to change the channel  did you ask her she's into it no i just assumed okay um and or the other that or the the tv  entertainment center people that were there were into it and put it on but i don't know i just sat 
[00:53:00]  down on the couch and pretty much passed out uh but during the time i sat down i was listening it was  it's intolerable it's just this droning hum throughout the entire thing it's a torture  if you fucking made an al-qaeda guy in guantanamo listen to that for hours on end it would absolutely  be considered torture there there would be investigations and blue ribbon commissions and 
[00:53:30]  everything if some fucking guy is sitting there and they're they're they were asking him uh all  right what did you know about uh the embassy bombing but what what what what what what what what what  what did you what did you know i knew nothing of the the bombing i oh okay please stop it stop it  i will tell you i will tell you please this is like fucking audio waterboarding 
[00:54:00]  can you keep that going so i can do my bit yeah  oh no not the beat not the beat  yeah for the vavuzula you know you make a very good point the vavuzula make a very good point 
[00:54:30]  people would talk but now you want to hear it because it's become such the thing the sound is  a star remember how you said if you just take uh uh an orange or a grapefruit right and take it around  well you have to put it on the country you have to put it on tv for uh i don't know how long and  then you could actually take that orange on the road and people would be fascinated like holy shit  that's the orange that was on tv that's the one look it's the orange right and and the sound itself  has become a celebrity where now you tune in going i want to hear that what does that sound like i want 
[00:55:00]  to hear what that vavuzula and that's all about and is the um is the nigeria germany uh score thing a real  no it's totally fake yeah okay i saw that over did they play each other though they would have to  put germany first germany could not be the home team yeah i i'm sure most people saw it on their  social networking the the screen cap of nigeria and germany playing yeah where obviously it would 
[00:55:30]  be nig for nigeria and their score below that and then right next to that would be the ger for germany  germany and for a while put them all together and you get right for a while over the weekend  people thought it was real and now we're hearing it it probably wasn't i think it just didn't look  like a professional graphic is what it was and also i think nigeria's uh abbreviation is nga  so it's oh really so what could you spell with that that's not even fun whoever thought of that 
[00:56:00]  though bravo that was a good one babe ruth oh babe ruth in shape out of shape okay yeah yeah we were  talking more more about like actors from when we were growing up where our aunts our mothers oh they  were in love they would swoon they would almost fucking start diddling themselves in front of you  because john wayne didn't have a shirt on and now you look back and go what the fuck he was a mess  there it is nig and then ger over there yeah so oh what else did you have on the world cup that was 
[00:56:30]  it oh yeah i was just watching a little bit and uh i i i really could not get into it uh there was a  lot of running back and forth a lot of guys kicking toward that goal and just missing the goal completely  a lot of guys working it all the way up to the goal and then uh just another guy comes sliding in and  kicks the ball away no why wouldn't they maybe take take two players off the field from each side 
[00:57:00]  yeah doesn't the game get way more exciting i think it opens up the field yeah or how about this it's  so hard to even get close to the goal to score how about no goalies wow think about it though how  many saves do these guys have a game the whole team has to get in there and yeah yeah people love  their soccer man every time we talk about soccer i get killed because people like man i fucking love  this sport how could you trash it you don't understand it blah blah blah i know we just don't 
[00:57:30]  understand things what do i know we're we're just stupid just a sport i just never never got into but  yeah but i definitely watching more and more of it though well uh like i said it was on and um i  then turn it right off right not out of interest in the sport but just interest in the fact that  people are interested it's the vuvuzelas and the vuvuzelas can you imagine it it's your job  to make an announcement to the the stadium to stop blowing the vuvuzelas i don't think uh that would 
[00:58:00]  work you don't think that would work well i don't think that would fly with those people  and and those people and what you're hearing is just thousands and thousands of people just  continually continually blowing those damn they won't stop it's constant  right then a few guys uh stop because they have to take a break but there's there's more people  that are continuing oh yeah yeah around them it's not going to stop if one person stops if you were  sitting in that stadium though and you didn't have one of those horns to blow oh and you were in the 
[00:58:30]  minority fuck that you would be out of your mind you would have to leave the stadium they said  they're running out of earplugs oh what they're selling earplugs for the people yeah yeah they're  running out you don't want to sit there with that right behind you imagine that shit next to you  you're just surrounded by vuvuzelas uh danny i got something for you today this guy's saying eight  shots on net per team for 120 minute match bird from philly is that accurate because then my 
[00:59:00]  taking away the goalie thing isn't a crazy idea because you would adjust your defense a little  bit too knowing you don't know of course so so even those eight shots wouldn't be h uh wouldn't be  eight goals i mean no just because they're so it'd still be a relatively low scoring game if you  didn't have goalies how many shots on goal you're talking sacrilege by the way as far as soccer goes  you're talking about changing the entire game right here well are are you happy with the one 
[00:59:30]  zero score a one one score i could give a shit if they trotted and made it a basketball score  i i i it doesn't hold my interest i just uh one guy scores and then he's got to run down the  he's got to run down the field right and take his shirt off and wave it around i love that we just  took the word football and made it our own yeah we said fuck you and look how pompous we are our  sport that is called football they barely use their feet a couple kicks here and there a couple field 
[01:00:00]  goals that's yeah i know most of the game is not used with your feet and the ball two guys using their  feet right on the entire game we're gonna take your fucking sport you call football yeah where you're  using your feet the entire game and we're gonna fucking take that word make a whole nother sport where  we barely use our feet fuck you we're just fucking assholes in this country we really are just pompous 
[01:00:30]  assholes we fucking just ruled for so long we figured we could do whatever we want here it is  the average number of shots on goal in a pro soccer game is usually around eight to ten a game so you would  still have a low scoring game without goalies yeah because not out of those eight to ten on on on goal  you would adjust a little bit and you would stop a few of those yes it's anywhere between what  four per side maybe four or five goals or five per side you'd have a you'd have a lot more excitement  excitement and now i'm being called stupid from someone in the uk oh boy no goalies are you 
[01:01:00]  fucking stupid you're stupid uk yeah think about it though you and your stupid newspapers what's  wrong with the oh i hate them i've talked about this before they just they're all lies i go to drudge  report and i click on a link about the fucking it says asteroid headed toward earth and you're like  what the fuck and you click on it and then you see that link come up www fucking something uk 
[01:01:30]  the mirror and then and then you read the story and realize it's such sensationalized  bullshit it has nothing to do with the truth yeah the mirror dot co dot uk yes yes emergency yes  well what are they talking about today yesterday they had something that just annoyed the piss out  of me when i went to it because i was like you know you motherfuckers you you wrote me in to go to  your fucking site with a sensational and what was the sensational story again no if my computer 
[01:02:00]  worked because i i'm gonna i'm gonna hit you up with something i saw yesterday all right let me let  me see because uh tell you the truth it's probably still on here i'm gonna fucking hit you up with  something oh come on load a fucking network in this shithole you want to start with mine then all  right what's yours uh some dude in north carolina spotted bigfoot oh really and cnn took it as a very  serious story how could they do that could you go to cnn and the bigfoot story and you got to listen 
[01:02:30]  to this fucking guy and not one person on cnn going wow this guy seems a little fucked up  it just hit yesterday well maybe they took it off their site already because they're embarrassed  that they even had it on oh got it then no fuck go to um um mediate had it m-e-d-i-a-t-e dot com 
[01:03:00]  which is a pretty good fucking website as far as news sources go you can't find it yeah there he is  to the right he looks like arty lang this guy looks like arty lang yet and you gotta install shit  okay look at this this was on cnn yesterday and just uh the visual is very easy he looks like  arty lang and he saw bigfoot in in his backyard ah in north carolina and hopefully we'll have the  audio in a second and not one person on cnn laughing at the guy commercial of course your video will play 
[01:03:30]  in 10 seconds gotta sit through these commercials like i said man 15 seconds uh 30 i don't mind  even it's a long time all right here we go i tried to call him tim peeler thought he was calling  coyotes instead of them him he got something that frightened even the self-proclaimed mountain 
[01:04:00]  man this thing was 10 foot tall he had beautiful hair it scared me sergeant markself as a cleveland  county deputy didn't see the creature this time there was a 8 to 10 foot hairy man looking person  but remembers the stories of a sasquatch when he was a kid was uh killing some animals breaking in  chicken houses killing chickens it's the same mo that tim says he saw for himself here comes tim 
[01:04:30]  again the sasquatch going after his dogs i come out here and rough talk him and run him off got him  to leave called 9-1-1 then the creature came back and i said get away from here get  that's great stick at him and he went right back out that path again really deputies filed a suspicious  person report and tim is still recalling the details he looked like he had six fingers on each 
[01:05:00]  hand but even though sworn to serve and protect this is just totally uh blowing my mind that's even  brought back up are left manning up at least for the cameras doesn't bother me now i don't think there's  anything to it see the problem is there's a sheriff down there that remembers bigfoot sightings when he  was a lot younger yeah but this guy tim who sort of looks like arty lang is out of his  fucking mind and no one's calling him crazy he he told the bigfoot thing to get by using a stick 
[01:05:30]  he was demonstrating how he did it right because a 10-foot bigfoot type creature is going to be scared  of tim out of shape tim out of shape out of shape guy out of shape out of shape guy right um let's see  oh and here's an example of what i what i was talking about yeah it said uh nasa warns of solar  flares so i'm you know i like science i click on it here's the from the telegraph uk nasa warns  solar flares from huge space storm will cause devastation britain could face widespread power blackouts 
[01:06:00]  and be left without critical communication signals for long periods of time after the earth is  hit by a once in a generation space storm no no no why not it's possible no they're they're  constantly over hyping everything and and over dramatizing you go to the nasa site you'll 
[01:06:30]  realize yeah we're due for solar flares nothing that we haven't had before and we could we could  kind of handle them right and then they always try to say that like at the end it's like well we've  had these before at the end of the story so uh don't panic right okay so they're uh sensationalizing  the whole thing they sensational they love the big dramatic headline as dumb fucking limeys they'll  sit there and suck it up oh right what do you think of the bigfoot story though that's true but tim yeah 
[01:07:00]  uh uh we go to uh cleveland jeff what are you doing man hitter jeff i'm rolling down the road hey uh  you guys need to pull drops from that for uh patrice o'neal you know like the get out of here line  and stuff because i think that'd be just great if you surprised patrice with those well oh you're  going to help us out with our show yeah well i'll believe if i had a laptop and you know i'd  i'd tear it apart i'd ask you if i had the time so i appreciate the help jeff we need it at this  point thank you that's great thank you hey i'll move up there what else should we do

[01:08:00]  and poke him with a stick do you believe in the bigfoot thing no yeah i don't think i do anymore  we've been around i used to love believing in it when i was younger we've just been around too many  places where he was supposed to be and no one's ever really gotten a good view no one's ever found a  dead one like a real dead wood right bigfoot's big woods if there were bigfoot's uh feats around  you'd find a dead one come on a little road kill like bigfoot wouldn't cross the street and get  nailed by a fucking peterbilt or something fuck that all the hunters going deep yeah yeah yeah 
[01:08:30]  shooting thinking it's a deer or something what's this bigfoot so smart it can evade us  for so long stop and what's creepy is uh the guys that set up the cameras in the middle of the woods  yeah black and white cameras and they they let them roll all night or all weekend and then you  sit there at home hoping to catch bigfoot where's bigfoot usually it's just a few deer yeah just  deer deer walking by the camera yep uh yeah you know what uh mongo's kind of right today mongo 
[01:09:00]  yeah that audio is going to become the white man's version of the look upon audio oh where to go dad  can we play that going on a break because yeah that was our white man moment right there tim  totally thinking he saw the bigfoot get out of here get you get you get you get  we'll play leprechaun going into the break when travis finds it real fast yeah  then we'll regroup we're gonna get patrice o'neill in here soon we're gonna talk about some other

[01:10:30]  many of you say the leprechaun looks like others find it hard to believe and have come up with their  own theories and explanations for the image my theory is it's casting a shadow from the other limb could  be a crackhead that got hold to the wrong stuff and it told him to get up in the tree and play a leprechaun  we're gonna get down to the bottom of this yeah still down there guy don't be afraid don't be afraid 
[01:11:00]  man this guy helping to direct traffic says he's prepared for his encounter with the leprechaun  he's suited up from head to toe this waters off smells right here this is a special leprechaun flute  which has been passed down from thousands of years ago from my great great grandfather who was irish  i just came to help out others just came to get lucky in hopes a pot of gold may be buried under  this tree i'm gonna run a backhoe and uproot that tree i want to know where to go like i want to go

[01:15:00]  all of them are assholes grabs him by the wrist and squeezes what a tough guy what's this guy's  past oh so he's gonna fucking skeletons this guy got so does he grab that kid uh you know his  right arm so hard like that i think you have every right to give him a left hook to pop on what you  left absolutely uh uh well another thing that was caught on video that i um that i think it's  completely taken out of context and the way the news is treating it is just ridiculous in seattle 
[01:15:30]  there was a police officer right and um he punches a white police officer punches this black chick in the  face and it's uh the news is all over it i haven't seen this yet as uh police officer punches woman in  face now you watch the entire video and realize this guy is oh yeah see look at that but he's totally  justified he is completely justified in popping that fucking annoying instigator right in the face holy 
[01:16:00]  shit i haven't seen this yet oh and you know what she backed right the fuck off back off  bitch now a couple things anthony that's all you see is that clip see that's the problem where's the  long-form clip yeah because this guy's got to know better we we talk about this all the time cops  you're being filmed all the time now oh yeah he knew he was being filmed there are other people with  cameras all over the place so where's the uh the rest of this video because all we're seeing is a 
[01:16:30]  five-second clip over and over again where where she takes a right right buzz  fucking buzz cut white cop grabs a black chick and just pops her right in the face  right in the face what's the backstory of that what are they saying so far well they're saying  she was being uppity okay i'm teasing of course there she was interfering with uh an arrest he was  trying to make oh here's the long form grabbing him yeah this is the original arrest so the cops 
[01:17:00]  trying to arrest this one woman there's one woman in the black shirt and he's trying and then look  look the one in the pink gets in and at one point he pushes the officer and he pops her in the face  because now look the other chick's on his back now are you outnumbered are you serious  oh and then this guy are you serious are you serious who's this guy saying are you serious can  you turn this the camera man serious i know the camera man but who's he just some black guy that 
[01:17:30]  came over into the crowd are you serious they have a word for this on uh and mania.com by the way  and he's she's not fucking complying  take your hands off me no you're being arrested dummy  and why are you soccer i saw that  i mean you're ripping her clothes man shut up he's trying to arrest her you dummy 
[01:18:00]  you just socked her in her face  yeah she's crying  this guy's having trouble why can't he battening her down  why can't he get her cuffed because she's trying to grab  no she did no she was yeah she was then you saw that on the video  this top is brave because where's the help oh i know where's his backup this looks like it could be  an ugly situation anyone could reach over and grab his gun 
[01:18:30]  you ain't gotta do that and she's not putting her arm behind her fucking back so he's twisting her arm  back this cop is is completely justified in everything he did  and he's telling the one he popped in the face to stay right where she is 
[01:19:00]  fuck dead  get arrested and shut up  he got the cuffs on finally got the cuffs on and she starts screaming and crying that is so  fucking annoying if he had a taser he'd use that fucking thing i'm sure he didn't have one on him  so uh because he's completely outnumbered by the way yep and he's trying to take down that that one uh  black girl he's trying to get her arms behind her back she will not comply she is completely 
[01:19:30]  resisting arrest then her friend comes over and starts grabbing at the cop from behind and then  goes in front and pushes him uh so he just grabs him by the arm and punches her in the face taking  her out of the mix he did exactly what he was supposed to do i'm amazed that other people on the  scene here didn't get involved well you know what one cop trying to deal with this whole situation you  pop one in the face and uh maybe uh wow that's a hell of a pop and she just she left the fucking 
[01:20:00]  situation he took her he made her a non-threat and then i see danny shaking his head what are you  what are you seeing on this i just don't understand how you know you think that it's  okay wherever you are to put your hands on an officer and you're looked at as like if and then this  guy i'm having a hard time no it's all right describing how pissed off i am with this video i 
[01:20:30]  know i was like that last night i was losing my fucking mind i had to retweet it there's no  there's no situation where you should ever put your hands on a cop put it on a cop right right  it you know they are the authority figure whether or not you feel that you were wronged or whatever  you just need to comply with the officer deal with it later deal with it later deal with it  later i hate these guys with the with the uh the video cameras go oh that's wrong man oh no oh no  you didn't know you punched her oh no there's never i would never ever ever think of a situation where  i would think it was okay to put my hands on an officer in the way that uh these women put 
[01:21:00]  their hands when he's trying to arrest somebody else too because you know damn well you're  fucking getting popped in the face you seen this clip yet patrice well patrice has entered  oh shit oh shit entered at a great time we have to go right into the black white thing  hold on i'll stick my middle finger up just because i know something well well uh  yeah all right play this for patrice yes now now this explain to patrice what's happening  all the news i want patrice's angle on this here's the news the news is saying uh cop 
[01:21:30]  punches woman in face okay that's the headline that's the clip they're playing over and over again  and you'll see it in this clip in context but all they've been showing is the cop grabbing some  black chick it's and popping it right in the face it's it's lol it's a hell of a punch  it's but you can you're explaining the conspiracy editing of this it's absolute well all this let's  see well all the show well okay all the showing is is the cop punching the woman in the face the 
[01:22:00]  other one first so you don't know any the reason why it's always rough to see a guy punch a woman  i gotta be honest with you look at that there we go here here it is oh yeah yeah just punches  her face and they keep here's all they show on the news okay white officer punches black woman in  face boom her head goes back nice punch right to her right to the kisser boom it is funny i mean 
[01:22:30]  it's funny in a sick way that's his wig just oh yeah  oh we he gave a rollercoaster face  what is rollercoaster face  yeah i'm sure they taught him that move in the academy yeah to subdue a black 
[01:23:00]  bitch knock that bowl right in the chops man  fuck me man is there any reason for that what you do bite that  niggas dick right before there is a reason that's the problem that's all they're showing  but that's all they're showing on the news now here's the whole clip here's the whole clip  all right oh by the way for the people at home denny so they can play along where do they go go to  youtube type in seattle police confrontation okay make sure you get the long clip not like the  30 seconds people get frustrated when we do the visual thing but this is this is worth it man 
[01:23:30]  just to hear rollercoaster face from patrice that's i'm gonna use that so much now hell of a  hell of a way to start your appearance on the show this time man i love that right out of the box with a  with a brilliant line all right here's here's the clip now if you notice it's a different girl that  he's tussling with at the beginning of this he's got a situation on his hands here he's is alone  they're cutting out the f word i don't know why well it's a news clip because this 
[01:24:00]  bitch he's trying to arrest will not stop she's not complying  saying get the fuck off me push different different girl right okay we gotta make  now here comes pinky here comes the girl in the pink shirt pushing the cop he's got his hands full  with this other girl now he's trying to get in between can you pause this and bam punches her in the  face once hold on but you missed something which is key to this her boyfriend pinky's uh  boyfriend trying to pull her away it's like you don't want to do that he knew what was coming and 
[01:24:30]  pinky goes fuck that i'm getting involved and that's key to this whole clip her boyfriend knew  what was happening on my part right patrice abso-fucking-lutely look the dude is like no  man you don't want out of this stay out of this this is not a good situation you want to get involved  and she's all cocky and confident going well fuck that i'm gonna get in the middle of this  motherfucker i ain't scared of no fucking police officer here's what she learned this day this  day what she learned patrice she learned this day the word options and i had to teach every 
[01:25:00]  bitch i ever been with options which is like look you don't at that a great term is your mouth  writes a fucking check that your ass cannot cash what what was making her do that was woman  and here's what i learned when i was 16 cops hate people who do things based on the law they think  they know all right right the law they think they know he can't put his hands on a woman it you got 
[01:25:30]  that that bitch learned a valuable lesson that men learn we learn the lesson of getting fucked up  physically that women don't learn because they've taken away everything that we could do to stop  them right like just even if you grab a bitch by the side of both sides of the face and just move from  the left to the right just to say bitch you know what my shoulders i'm allowing you to live  this cop didn't even have to do that he just said wait everybody let me show you something all right 
[01:26:00]  stop me from moving your face from the left to the right watch this go ahead bitch and then you  just stop and you just said look but still he's in deep shit that fucking guy clocked his hoe oh yeah  but once again uh danny freeze frame this there you go yeah look at him he's man whoever that is maybe  just a friend maybe a boyfriend is like no man stay out of it he's seen it watch the look  fuck it off me get off right now he's six flags nigga she got she just got six flags that was 
[01:26:30]  it was one flag for her it was six flags for the cop nigga  fucking bitch stop and now and now he completely took her out of the mix because she backs right  the fuck off now oh yeah and he goes back to the other girl who will not fucking comply and and the 
[01:27:00]  guy with the camera now watching the cop punch this uh bitch is is like oh no oh no like like he did  something wrong he did no he didn't he did as a cop because he's this look cops have a different uh  he is supposed to control the situation and and his safety was in jeopardy first of all yeah he is  he is arrogance on the cops part all right ready officer needs assistance he was he was calling into 
[01:27:30]  his mic he was he was saying yeah yeah yeah yeah he was he was getting fair enough he was getting  backup but you can't just stand around go could everybody be cool until backup comes here and can  no bitches jump on my back cops are supposed to be better than us in these situations i'm supposed  to you know what if i clock the bitch like that under any circumstances i'll go to jail for assault  that's period no matter if there's seven bitches on me if i put a bitch's face like he did yeah but  there are different come on man there are different rules in that situation for a police officer 
[01:28:00]  he is under and by the way police officer shit though and he got the taser shit would have been  more acceptable he probably didn't have one or or if he tased her in something and then there would  have been all the tase cops tase a fucking woman and wait what you're not seeing yet patrice he had  a tough time cuffing her he popped her in the face so forever to cuff the other took her right out of  the fucking mix let's play it boom wow he didn't keep pounding on her he didn't kick her in the head  he punched her once right in the fucking kisser and she she also all of a sudden decided her 
[01:28:30]  boyfriend was right why don't we somebody needs to get our boyfriend on the phone and go did that  help you he see he probably was like man oh nigga it took me a long time i could never get that  bitch right he pulled her away and she like got out of his grip and said no i'm going in he  chris brown thinking thinking she's gonna fucking make a difference oh did he nail her he chris brown  he put that bitch to a wall play it again i'm still not convinced he should have punched you like this 
[01:29:00]  though  kenny yes please kenny please professional opinion please sir please i mean be honest i i watched this  clip two or three times okay is it working yeah i watched this clip two or three times last night  and uh there's a lot of issues going on here kenny you would have never smashed that  bitch in the face like that you would have never did that we'll see when i was a professional police 
[01:29:30]  officer my was that your first week out of the academy  you have to be nice until it's time not to be nice all right yes how many years of unprofessional  service did you have no i'm uh i'm very proud of my career was there ever a problem with the ever  problem you had with a woman where you would you would have never smashed a chick like that because 
[01:30:00]  your madness would have stopped you you would have did what was some other shit but you would  have never put this bitch out like that yeah hypothetically i heard one time oh yeah that these  two cops all right was handling a boyfriend girlfriend dispute and the one cop was cuffing  up the boyfriend uh-huh and the cop's partner was dealing with the woman okay and that cop turned  to look at the other cop dealing with the woman and it looked like they were ballroom dancing in the 
[01:30:30]  middle of the street right right and the cop yelled at his partner like what what are you doing  stop playing around yeah and and and the cop yelled back but she's a lady okay and the cop said well  she ain't acting like a lady fair enough you know so so so then that other cop after he coughed up the  boyfriend went over to the lady hip threw it to the ground and coughed her up  but wait a minute though hip hip throwing hip throwing is an accept i'd have took i'd have took a 
[01:31:00]  hip throwing more venom but then that was a non-police if it was one girl if you noticed something after  he dispatches pinky he's got that other chick that he still has to deal with and he never  fucking laid a hand on her as far as punching her and she was putting up a fight she was putting  up a struggle what was he didn't want to deal with two people with two bitches right okay girl or guy 
[01:31:30]  two people that were on him and other people that might have he didn't know if anyone else was getting  involved so he dispatches problems as they come in and he left if one to one i've seen like fun  things yeah where white bitches was acting crazier oh and i never see i seen a white bitch get tased  maybe but i i just can't imagine if that was a white bitch getting smashed getting roller coaster  faced she would have i like that he this i've never seen it i think i've seen domestics where they 
[01:32:00]  where they pound where they pound a white bitch uh white trash bitch because uh they're taking their  man away and uh she gets involved she gets crazy they go back off back off back off she gets nuts  won't won't stop and they they pop that was such a not in your uniform  fucking thing that was a punch because he couldn't be  tussling with two of them he could have controlled her uh maybe by shaking i'm on his side in a lot of 
[01:32:30]  degrees but you know that the racial situation immediately has to bubble somewhere i don't want to  make it right but it's like i know i know it's to me this guy dude any bitch should have gotten  punched well let's put the mass any bitch doing that should have gotten punched in the face let's  play the clip again there sam this cop's in a no-win situation yeah yeah he's gonna get screwed for  this of course even though he don't know that would you but but kenny would you do you think was there  ever did you think would that move like kenny that punch was you would have never did that punch 
[01:33:00]  that's a man thing there that wasn't a fucking like cop thing this motherfucker you can't make  it look like a man punch it that's what you know what i mean it was not it was not government  issue punch right it wasn't right you can't you can't he got a strong armor a little bit or or  something or bitch slapper you can't do the man punch i just pray he gets he has a good lawyer  yeah he's in trouble yeah all right let's play the clip again so there's pinky being held back but 
[01:33:30]  she says fuck that and she gets involved in the arrest of this other woman and bam  are you serious  are you serious  oh my lord this whole get the fuck off me thing are you serious i don't understand the get  the fuck off me but see put your hands behind your back and he will not be doing that to you 
[01:34:00]  little pause is this this is the thing i know  i do it i do a joke where i go look white women do something to get killed black women do  you know that they need to get some lesson there yeah some man lesson man lesson that 
[01:34:30]  that is egregious what this bitch is doing it's like stop doing what you're doing but this is it  i don't know if it's girl or it's black i don't know i really don't know but do you understand something  if that woman put her hands behind her back do you honestly think that that police officer would  be slamming her around the fucking car i don't know i've seen some shit i've seen some shit where  niggas just limp like oh i know he goes to the stiff ballet dance and that motherfucker still gets 
[01:35:00]  beat down some shit and it's usually after a car chase they drag him out of the car they're all  pumped up and they're fucking just bashing the shit out of this guy i understand they're mad because they  took him on his journey yeah yeah they're kind of mad they were going home they were on their way  home and i'm not sure what i'm seeing here this bitch should just fucking stop he's he's trying to  just get her arms behind her back if she did that guaranteed he would have cuffed her put her in the 
[01:35:30]  car and none of that shit would be this is why i'm saying and and i think i say in this to kenny because  it is i always say look cops cops should be able to arrest you if they weren't cops meaning  i want my police to be better than me physically yes this guy might not be better than a girl  physically man he this seems like i wouldn't i think i would be laughing as this because it  seems like he got a neck move yeah that he can do to cause her pain that wouldn't happen that might 
[01:36:00]  have been worse pain than the punch yeah he got some shit they taught him police he's trying to like  get a get her in an arm lock he's wrestling with this bitch yeah but he didn't he didn't know how  to do the arm lock he did it backwards he did it backwards i saw that yeah yeah this guy he's  going to be laughed out of the police department if he doesn't get incarcerated uh this guy keith  from detroit is a cop on line uh four he deals with detroit and he yeah yeah so he's he's got a 
[01:36:30]  little bit of a uh of experience with this hey keith hey what's up fellas how you doing  look let me tell you black bitches when you try to arrest them are the worst motherfuckers in the  world to put the cuffs on really because first of all they think oh take your fucking hands it's  always take your fucking hands off me you know why excuse sir i'm gonna interrupt why 
[01:37:00]  i i'm it's it's the law shit you ain't supposed to touch me you a man it's like get your hand they  look like get your hands off me yeah like no and this guy's black right yeah this yeah he's okay  it's a it's a and you just have like a very tough time with the black women no it's like this  someone teaches them this jailhouse bullshit law stuff and they think they can't be arrested and when 
[01:37:30]  they come out there and you want to arrest one the whole neighborhood comes out and you have to  crack some fucking wait a minute though officer you have but if you watch this clip you i guarantee  you what's your size by the way i'm six to 255 you've never you've never punched a woman like that  you've done some some rough shit but you you fucking cock the bitch  imagine that big meaty fist as a matter of fact retreat he should have knocked the 
[01:38:00]  bitch out oh my lord have mercy a message all right because when you are engaged with one  individual trying to arrest them you don't need another one so guess what eliminate the threat as  soon as possible yeah that's what he did yeah black cops saying this now okay so now it's not racial  now it's a cop thing okay sir is the is that is that oh by any means necessary kind of law that we 
[01:38:30]  don't know about like i didn't think you were supposed to be clocking women like isn't there  what's the police procedure no there's no procedure she is considered a threat when she put her hands on  him right okay when you're engaged with another individual all right you don't need someone else  doing something trying to stop you from making their arrest okay first of all you never know if  this will come out of her bra or panties with a knife okay okay eliminate you as quickly as possible 
[01:39:00]  so so okay physical okay physical hand uh uh uh uh like okay eliminate the threat what you say  eliminate the threat but is there isn't there like soon as you feel maybe a threat that you pull  out stop threat something like your pistol or your fucking taser you're talking about making a kid  for trees or what i'm saying i'm saying like to put your hand meaning it seems like you shouldn't  have cops wrestling with people in the street he wasn't using deadly physical force on her 
[01:39:30]  no no no he just he eliminated the threat with a stunning blow to the face look i'm not even i'm  not even fucking i don't have a problem with that but i'm saying it seems i think drawing your weapon  is a lot more dangerous uh in that situation it doesn't seem like police should be getting into  tussles that's part of the fuckers that's part of the training uh that's part of the training  day patrice when you're on patrol patrice okay you're getting tussles every day domestic violence 
[01:40:00]  and i give you detroit by the way you you know you get a different pass because you in  afghanistanville so it ain't like we're talking about fucking intersection where mcdonald's and  and and puffy's uh it's it's uh you in detroit so i i have to say you know i've seen clips of like  those those like on black websites and stuff or fights in the black bitches in in in detroit  you know fight better than some dudes so i can understand that exactly i can understand another

[01:48:30]  there's no white police we can't find any i believe we've been looking for trees we've been  looking for you we have the clip of when benny grable was getting rambunctious yeah uh  we had a clip of the the grapefruit clip yes with the mush in the baby grapefruit clip  that's as far as we have one of the greatest clips ever can we play that today we haven't played  that in a while i know it's old school but that grapefruit to the face of that 
[01:49:00]  bitch is pretty goddamn fun as a routine accident but when it was over a shreveport woman was lying  in a pool of blood at the shreveport police department and the police officer who had been  with her wound up being fired ktbs 3's chrissy quill joins us tonight with more on this story you'll  see only on three chrissy this was all caught on videotape oh boy well jody at least some of it was but  a lot of this case revolves around what wasn't caught on tape we want to caution you some of 
[01:49:30]  the video you're about to see is very graphic i love hearing that roll okay after angie garbarino  had a wreck shreveport police took her in on suspicion of dwi as this video shows she was very  argumentative officer wiley willis was required to read her her rights but garbarino was insisting  on making a phone call yeah she thinks she knows the law now again and and i just wanted to make a 
[01:50:00]  quick very quick yeah um something that black girls don't have that if you've seen that other  clip is that sense of entitlement though the black girls are willing to fight for this like just  they're scrappy uh white this lady has this entitlement of of even above the law kind of feel not more 
[01:50:30]  says i'm ready to fight with you cop yeah it's more or less you i'm where's your where's your manager  to a cop right right where's your manager like it's mcdonald's i like to speak to your manager  like she's also intoxicated um and uh she thinks she knows the law she's like oh she always in in in  the cartoons they always get one phone call they get their phone call right it's like you know something  right now you're not getting your call right now right it's it's uh right yeah yeah so they get this  these uh misconceptions about what what it's like uh being arrested it's on oh yeah it's 
[01:51:00]  everywhere oh it's big news it's it's huge news and all they're showing is the punch and then and  then they're not showing that that the guy tried to hold the girl back and and not to get right  with the rest the arrest of the other woman they cut it right when the boyfriend pulls pinky away  guys so fired if that's the clip they're playing on now the riot over there at south street seaport  yeah we'll get to that a little later that's another good one a little free concert  drake was playing bitch a little free concert that went horribly wrong and is there more black 
[01:51:30]  black people doing shit yeah it's a white boy i saw a thing you saw the whitey throwing something  okay patrice just went oh and look but the chair got launched oh god no they try to do a free concert  at uh south street seaport this is it i'm telling you it's a very revolutionary kind of shitty  undertone i'm feeling though people it really is yeah people are really upset with something  i will not deny that you're absolutely right it's bubbling over with the negro president 
[01:52:00]  the negro president who by the way i heard you guys talking about uh two things one your hot dog  line and harry carrey did not get enough credit you motherfuckers should have laughed harder that  made me fucking laugh but second it's there's some kind of undertone dude that's very yeah it's it's  very like fuck the government i wish again it wasn't obama that it was overflowing on yeah but he  lost his authority i'm gonna tell you when he lost his authority i'll give you one guess when people 
[01:52:30]  say fuck you and it's not the oil thing obviously it's not the oil thing so one little thing little  thing it's a it should be it should have been little but it was big was beer yep the beer what do i get  he uh no you get a good job nothing like bush would have never let anybody fucking that was so  tell him to do he had a beer with that fucking cop he called that cop foolish and if somebody he should 
[01:53:00]  have said fuck him he was foolish now what the fuck y'all gonna do about it i still got three more years  to go he didn't hnic that shit he should have joe clarked it joe clark i'm telling you but after he did  that no one believed he can't even handle his punk ass citizens let alone this oil thing and these big  government it yeah it's he fucked himself royally when he had when he had beer with these guys and had 
[01:53:30]  a fucking sit down with that fucked up cop you think the cop was fucked up he wasn't let me tell you  again i keep saying it i'm just saying i keep saying it i one thing i hate and not from you not  from the show i don't like white people's lying attitude about subversive racism i don't like how  it has to be a clan member for it to be racist or a skinhead who's saying nigger who has a tattoo 
[01:54:00]  niggers ain't shit on his eyelids for it to be racism so when a cop does these things right that  you feel a racist you can't prove it it's this na na na na quiet shit about racism that i don't  fucking like he was being racial okay fuck racist he might not have been like a frothing at the mouth  fucking nigga hater but he was being racial it was a fucking black guy in his own house there was 
[01:54:30]  some kind of it was cambridge he would have not did that to the average white boy or the average  uh white version of that black man a fucking but he was he was called there he didn't just pass by  and think i'm gonna hassle a black guy in his house if if i said that he was dumb and i get the  thing is to be like look i would have fucking faked it as the president i wouldn't have said oops  my bag time for tea it's you he fucked up his authority when he did that he he just it's like 
[01:55:00]  the the country got mad at him and he had coffee with the guy he should have he might have should  have fucking sent his 10 motherfuckers down to knock on the door and go officer um we're from  the government we think we made a mistake and uh we're here to say sorry and we're going to  go for god but not uh open that he fucked up with that now nobody listens to him i i heard that oil 
[01:55:30]  speech it was just like really yeah two months you this yeah right bush did a lot of shit one thing he  did that was good he did a lot of i don't give a fuck so and i heard you all those those authoritative  presidents the ones that we felt comfortable with fucking reagan and clinton they did a lot  i don't give a fuck a lot yeah oh yeah it was just how you the best how they talked to the public  i liked the best presidents are usually the ones that are the i don't give a fuck they don't listen 
[01:56:00]  to a lot of people they they have an idea what they want to do and they fucking do it uh bush didn't  go down with katrina when he left he bush still didn't go down no for katrina he still he's didn't  go down for the war the longest war in the history of the planet earth he or this country he didn't  go down he laughed at shoes this nigga just said fuck it to every obama should just go look we trying 
[01:56:30]  and look i i president's going vacay he's doing too much and then we're and he's making this and then  we're going we have 30 000 it's like man dude you it it's something he lost and i and i feel bad i feel  bad for him there's an uh there's an authority that that i think white people are nervous about black  authority any goddamn way so you see the names you named it was like when you was naming who would  have been good or not a not a nigga in sight not sydney portier didn't come up 
[01:57:00]  fucking mr timbs had a little bit of somebody you know a little personality right mr paul robertson  oh man river a deep voice somebody martin luther king or somebody malcolm x to be an authoritative  president but white people and this is the thing you might say it because you're openly racial  another white guy might go no that's not true i would love martin luther king it's like just 
[01:57:30]  fucking be honest for a second that's some of that shit's racial yeah there's a lot of covert  race the tea parties some of it's not racial eat my ass i don't think it says racial some of it's not  racial i don't think it is as much as some people think it is i think a lot of people might not be  racist but it's definitely look man white people are annoyed at the black president economic uh i i 
[01:58:00]  think i think being taxed for some of these programs uh is some of this is some let me ask you a question  be honest as a white guy is some of this shit if as honest as you can be yeah if there was a white  president right now right would this same things be this this uprising feeling in the country would  the same things be happening if it was this stern white authority figure like doing the same thing 
[01:58:30]  with mccain if mccain was the fucking president mccain john mccain yeah john mccain john mccain  or mccain mccain did i say mccain mccain was it i kind of like knockatomy plaza there's a new  republican coming up in the ranks oh shit if bruce willis i'm sorry about that and you know these  cocksuckers got me for that now really mccain i'm sorry if mccain was the president what i would say 
[01:59:00]  the president and some duck to work with a zipper i would say yes to that patrice i would absolutely  say yes maybe not as much because it is a white president but definitely there's something going  on out there we're we're fucking had it as as a society let me think honestly the way i feel  having a black president makes it bubble a little more i'm thinking at least at least that it i'm  serious you'll never hear a motherfucker that ain't you guys say that shit there's a problem there is a  problem with a lot of people looking at obama being a black president not just because he's black it's 
[01:59:30]  because of what he does because he's black he appoints certain people based on his own race and  and uh his own races ideology and wants and and and i think it's cool there's not that many black  people doing a fucking thing in the government he's hiring a lot of lesbians and fucking puerto rican  attorney general and fucking you know who's the attorney general is it what's his national 
[02:00:00]  is he black is a black guy but some okay and that's how come no one if if the president bush  by the way had a lot of black people but yeah clinton didn't how come if if it was this is what  makes me i i would love to be fair all the time racially where it's just like boom boom boom but it's  like clinton and he didn't hire that many black people man and and it but you never look at if there's a  white attorney general like janet reno we just called her funny looking but it was not that it was a 
[02:00:30]  problem black people in power should be able to hire other black people and because there are some  qualified fucking niggas walking the streets i think you're absolutely right but when you get  somebody um you know like the attorney general talking about uh the fact that uh white people cannot  honestly talk about race and that which what is the fucking problem with that there's no problem 
[02:01:00]  but but if it's the other way around and you say black people can't talk about it then there's a  problem it just but you would never say that because black people can talk about race fairly and we're  down for but the issue is we don't like being able to not only ones who fucking say that there's  every time you have a racial conversation not you but white people yeah white people never go you  know in all honesty i hate niggas but here's what it's just it's always let me start out by saying 
[02:01:30]  it's never fucking it's always a i'm not racist angle yeah yeah you're always trying to please  you're always trying to that's paramount that's first and foremost before i do anything i want to  say look i'm not a racist but and then blah blah blah blah whatever you say is bullshit like you  you you could you could you could say you have prejudice and bigotry in you and and racism there  is there are i i i i base my opinions of people on as the great dr martin luther king said the content 
[02:02:00]  of their character i'm not basing shit on the color of people's skin do you think a fucking black ass  indian who i've seen indians blacker than any black black guy i've ever heard the term black  as indian any black i've seen indians so are you talking about the dot the dot indians yeah but  they always got white people hair though yeah they do what is that about there you go right there  it's not the color of the skin it's the curliness of their hair 
[02:02:30]  look at him trace is so right so not a hint of a not a hint of a curl in there  dim in their white people hair  that really bug me will you black face mop head there's not a hint of a nap in that hair  like that guy who asked indy to get the shankara stones  all right listen but but it's it's it's one of those things it's it's like i don't look at that  guy and go like oh look how brown he is ew i hate him because of the color of his skin 
[02:03:00]  it's like no he's working at some goddamn telephone thing telling me wrong things about  my dell computer and then i look at convenience store cameras and i see a black-skinned gentleman  holding a shotgun at the agent behind the counter it's his fault for not letting me steal the cigarettes  why is he fighting me over the gum and the lottery tickets i'm stealing why would he make me shoot  him you must go to pancart palace you must go to pancart palace get the stone we knew when the crops 
[02:03:30]  could come back that you would return the stone  call him  call him  dr johns cover your heart indy  dr johns  dr johns he's stealing cigarettes  uh we we started with the cop thing

[02:07:00]  people are they can't be trusted with the sharp knife he's cutting it he's cutting it with his long  nails because he's pulling them apart i was trying to pull them apart  oh damn two hits per grapefruit too by the way yeah two hits per grape she just looks over and  starts crying seeing a big bushel of grapefruits knowing everyone is going into her face until they  get a good take but that's when they fucking they that's back when they used to kick the little

[02:16:00]  gout real bad on those fucking when you're 40 000 feet in the air man it's fucking you gotta be  young to deal with that fucking shit they're just going back and forth they should have had that that  game tonight and give them two days rest man there's no fucking way they because the game was late  sunday in boston okay they probably left sunday night they had to go back home leave pack up  leave sunday night get there really late uh uh sunday or really early monday in la go check in a

[02:17:30]  that's weird two games la i mean in uh l32 you're right i'm sorry too you're right you're right so in  in in fucking i'm going old school remember when yeah when it was it went it went two two one one  one one one yeah right remember that which was better but maybe not because motherfuckers get  the gout flying back and forth yeah man my ankles through game seven in la he's just swollen ankles  motherfucking my ankles look like basketball they fucking look like like macy float heads 
[02:18:00]  all you can tell is it's my my shoe i'm my i'm busting out my shoes like the hulk  on the fucking plane your black celtics are in trouble game seven in la what are you thinking  you're done come on black celtics come on black celtics come on black celtics ever since you said  that on our show a while ago but you're shocked that we know this you saw i think you started on  our show and we popped up the picture of all the black celtics and their celtics uniforms 
[02:18:30]  just so out of place the black fucking celtics and they are black and let me tell you not because  they're color they got get nate robinson's a thug big baby is just frothing at the mouth  fucking they're getting kevin garnett everybody in the league at one point was scared of kevin  garnett he used to travel with his boys he was a fucking rough motherfucker paul pierces from  compton or some shit ray allen is the only black celtic that's not like fucking really black he can live in the 
[02:19:00]  white world yeah he's a he's look at his easily look at the face they have of him yeah like kind  of like happy but nate robinson throws gang signs during the game dude when nate does good he throws  gang signs you know yeah you don't want to see this shit you know like where it looks like your fingers  hurt but he can't play unless you allow him to be a gang member he cannot play correctly under rules  that is you gotta let him do his gang shit him rasheed wallace and doc rivers knows that so when 
[02:19:30]  they he tries to get as much out of them as he possibly can but he's a gang member look at him  yeah look he's throwing up he can't stop but he's he's amazing when when you let him be a gang member  and he can play you make a good point i used to be all in with basketball i really was i i i couldn't  get enough of the nba and it finally hit me i lost interest when the neck tattoo made it made the  appearance in the nba i was starting to try to figure out when did i lose interest and i think  when that when the tattoos started coming higher and higher and it's not over the shirt a little 
[02:20:00]  bit even over the shirt a little bit i was still in but now with the fucking neck tattoos jordan i  realize i don't like it as much magic bird sydney moncreate no tet a large one doesn't have a big  a giant basketball with a halo around it and jesus with sneakers it's like jesus with sneakers  it's awesome did you just have did you just have jesus dunking as a as can you not have any 
[02:20:30]  more crosses on your eyes on your face could you name one old school tattoo from one you know that's  very curious now who started the tattoo thing in the nba i think in 96 okay 96 that's 14 years  ago kobe didn't have a tattoo until i'm telling you until white people hated him for the for the  rape beef then he went tattoo and he tried to like mc hammer his way into black people because  black people was like fuck kobe because he snitched on shack and all that and there's something about 
[02:21:00]  him that just niggas don't like and he tried to put the fucking like he niggered himself up a little  bit with them fucking tattoos and and we wasn't falling for that shit but kevin garnett doesn't have  any tattoos either he came in in 96 i think tattoos start and look at his wings and prayers and king  crowns and horse shit to try to like get people to go hey you're fucking black uh but garnett doesn't  have any and i think 97 98 you might start tracing tattoos back to around 97 i don't know who there 
[02:21:30]  there's probably one here one there before that but that's yeah i think something bad bad happened  that seems about right i think kenya martin might have i think kenya martin is one of the pioneers  of this horseshit of the oh he has his girlfriend's lips tattooed his mama's face a couple of pistols  it's just he won't stop and like i said the worst of them all is jr and god bless it i love jr but he 
[02:22:00]  just has a giant he just has too many things what do you mean jr jr smith what does he have i mean dude he  has a giant i think did we talk about yeah i'm trying to remember what was it again young money  young money on his oh yeah it looks like in front of his neck looks like the yankee emblem it's  atrocious that's right i forgot about that and you know what i want to do i want to live to about  be 80 at least so i can see what the fuck alan iverson is doing oh you know what at 80 years old 
[02:22:30]  i just i just say that i go to the phones here john affiliate i don't have to go to him  iverson started the tattoos you know what that might be about right i and and iverson came in  in 97 i think i'm telling you trace it back to 97 i think that 97 thing is about right with and i  think i i think that guy's onto something iverson might have started that whole because jordan and  them were leaving bird bird retired in eight and nine imagine bird with a tattoo of of like or  jordan of a bird of a of a pigeon shooting a basketball with a jesus halo like although i get it 
[02:23:00]  although the jordan hitler mustache which we start on this show is now fucking taking over  the world what the hell is he fucking did you notice that shit yeah oh yeah we were the first  ones to talk about he's bringing back the hitler mustache if he pulls that off i'm gonna tell you  something it's the biggest thing of the 21st century all white people will be like hail jordan  if he brings thank you so much for bringing that back like i want to someday be able to just shave  off the edges of my mustache and come into work without without having people look at me in a 
[02:23:30]  certain way niggas will and his look uh carmelo has it and i have it too but the the seat here's  why jordan is buck wild that i have it you have the fate but i got it but it kind of goes into a  mustache you have a face on the nose carmelo has that also jordan is clean around the hitler mustache  jordan is completely has a fucking hitler mustache that is hitler he put a little  fucking hitler mustache the fuck is he thinking i mean he's that's gangster right but you know what 
[02:24:00]  who's to say why not let me tell you something here's what you bring back here's what hitler  hitler was a bad motherfucker in this in the fashion world yes the fucking flip bang too that flip  hitler bang oh that's coming back with the white kids with with the fucking tapered edges right hitler  kept his shit sharp if he didn't if he didn't kill six million jews man i think we'd be hitler and  up shit very fashionable uh sharp mouth clothing i think justin bieber has that justin bieber's got 
[02:24:30]  the hitler hey uh hitler's sweet patrice do now people are mad because we're not mentioning rodman  rodman was tattoo guy too you know what oh you got rodman and you got iverson it's right around  there was looked at like a freak he went crazy if you look at detroit wait a minute i'm a man i'm a  basketball watcher you look at detroit pistons did not have that he didn't have all that  shit till 96 97 when he's when he lost his fucking mind and i remember when rodman had the tattoos it 
[02:25:00]  looked so out of place on the court remember yep yeah i'm thinking all right i think it's down to  rodman and possibly an iverson thing that started this i might i might i might go with that i might go  and i was all right with it until they started moving up the neck i'm like whoa whoa but car but  carl malone didn't have have it none of them none of the old schoolers had had tattoos man none of  them is that true what somebody's saying um what happened didn't jordan buy up a lot of chaplin  memorabilia movies his cane and hat and things is that a tribute to charlie chaplin it might be but 
[02:25:30]  it but it's overshadowed by it hitler overshadowed charlie chaplin they don't call it the chaplin  mustache oh that's a hot hey man let me ask you a question is that hitler or chaplin yeah it's the  fucking hitler joint it's the hitler which tells you every time right chaplin had it right yeah which  tells you hitler was on the forefront of fashion because it was a it was the charlie chaplin but hitler 
[02:26:00]  hitler made it his own he fucked up all right so we got game seven tomorrow i think mussolini  had clear nail polish and he fucked up and you're not watching uh you're not watching world cup are  you you're not a world cup guy i watched are you taking a peek i watched brazil and north korea  yesterday your fucking tweet was hysterical yeah i'm watching and i'm seeing the  who cares the soccer fans get mad when you talk like this soccer um i i tweet soccer

[02:28:30]  it's soccer still sucks it's like no matter what you do this country you know what why doesn't  football this this is why these fucking boring sports why is a touchdown six points with an extra  point they could just make a touchdown one point yeah why because it fucking adds something to it  when the score is 28 16 even though they only scored three four points is three times 
[02:29:00]  maybe four four four five field goals or some yeah i got you but you know what i'm saying it it and  it's a possibility here's another thing they don't have to play to win it's not a i win sport it's a  wow watch the skill sport we're not playing around with that shit in this country man we tried it for  years see that's the thing about soccer uh folks football any america is a sports loving country 
[02:29:30]  if it has a certain kind of value to it we will fucking play it we sort of play soccer but it ain't  it's something about it that doesn't quench no that's fucking that thirsty thing man any sport that girls  can do as entertaining as men can't be respected wow wow you just fucking nailed it uh because even 
[02:30:00]  basketball they don't do as well as men no one gives a shit about the wnba i think they the championship  games tomorrow no one no one gives are you kidding are you kidding no no i'm not exactly that league is  about ready to go away oh yeah oh they i think they're in deep trouble they it's nokia they're  not even like the los angeles this and or the or the sacrament it's the it's the fucking uh the church's  chicken fucking spurs now like bad news bears sponsors yeah they have sponsors now like yeah 
[02:30:30]  like fucking bail bonds right like like uh like fucking i didn't know that yeah like poker chips.com  is oh wow you know they're because no one and here's the thing girls are fantastic man i love  girl i love girls because they're girls if you play basketball in panties and the nipple was out or it  just you fucking eat each other's pussy at the front i'd watch it all day long but you're playing 
[02:31:00]  man shit with girl legs and bodies you're on a fast break by yourself all right cindy got the ball  no one's and she lays it up exactly the same way she would have if someone was there in front of her  you're a girl you can't do any shit with it we did they fucking suck you can't take off from the  foul line they can't jump to a 360 they can't run here's what they should do lower the rims shorten the 
[02:31:30]  court to to the you know where the men's court ends at half court that's where you put the other  rim for the bitches so it moves faster they did make the ball smaller for them because they're girls  stop trying to be little dudes you fucking sit down and pee and i'm gonna tell you soccer you  watch women's soccer same excitement level as men's soccer yeah it's not like you're watching look and 
[02:32:00]  every and here's another thing about soccer every uh every if there's a new best player in the  world every day there's a new ronaldo that ain't the nigga from last week how'd they figure that out  if they're not scoring a lot that's what i'm saying i don't know right now messi messi messi  from argentina best play in the world really what happened to this other guy i got used to  ronaldino was the best last week and then cristiano was the best that we and then beckham was the best two 
[02:32:30]  years they changed the best to oven there's ten motherfuck they don't score and here's the  problem with even the score hockey finally figured it out i was watching uh somebody talking about  hockey they're trying to get it able you able to shoot more yeah soccer is like okay oh okay this  fucking little korean guy oh he went past no no no the guy kicked the ball and uh that's it ends in 
[02:33:00]  disappointment way too many times you don't even see a shot on the goal we we did this earlier patrice  the average soccer game eight to ten shots on goal per team what eight to ten soccer fans and that's  what 90 minutes of action stop being so um protective and and having an ownership you notice  football if you said to a football fan hey man football sucks they would go wow really nice  talking to you there's no argument football doesn't suck he'd be like i like it football doesn't because 
[02:33:30]  even when things are going bad this i argue with uh about rugby rugby's a sport for men oh yeah but  but but it's it's a constant bunch of horse shit  in football it here's how americans make things make sense it's rugby where i hit you run 
[02:34:00]  until i fucking stop you from running you i hit you and things are done get up and try it again  rugby's like that no rugby's rugby's yeah scrums and this guy's flipping backwards and then a guy  puts it and it never stops and it's there's no projectile hitting there's no you run as fast as  you can and hit somebody no it that's what i'm saying they go soccer do you know they can't barely i 
[02:34:30]  watched some of this shit they can't barely show a replay because soccer don't stop it doesn't stop  during it does the timeouts are not like okay huddle in this talk yeah timeouts happen you call this  guy off he just runs off and another fucker runs on and and they all look like they're doing the same  fucking thing we don't like it listen soccer fans we don't like it stop forcing us to like it we don't 
[02:35:00]  we're not rooting for here's how awful we we we call it a victory that america tied england  nobody gives a fuck victory and why is the soccer field so large why does it have to be that large  they make you tired they run too much what the fuck are you doing these niggas it's just  that's why we're talking about the dumb fucking horns so much there's nothing else to talk about  exactly stop the stop the horns anthony's got the app i got my app the my app get the

[02:38:00]  one time mate and uh you know this is the uh the back line of uh you see yeah it's what the  fuck this is the world's chance to shine yeah i was saying the other day after world cup game  the post game shows the easiest thing for anyone to do what are you what are you talking about after  the game especially when it's a one-one tie you could wrap up the game in two minutes go to the  highlights you can win you can win the world cup and not win a game like you it just could be a bunch 
[02:38:30]  of ties yeah and the point system and if it's zero zero you get nothing well it's just look people who  enjoy soccer don't get a lot of people enjoying it just say okay you don't like it listen this is  how america this is why we're losing we're losing our arrogance yeah look it it four billion people  are watching this fucking world cup and america doesn't give a shit and people want america to like 
[02:39:00]  it so they really do want us to watch it and and don't like it don't you understand we don't watch it  and but there's four billion of you watching it on one tv i might not even a flat screen an actual  real tv with antennas i was in brazil last world cup and uh fucking the hookers stopped working over  there yeah it's fucking oh shit really completely empty in world cup time boy they love it but we 
[02:39:30]  just don't like it but stop being angry if you don't like football or basketball i don't get mad they  really get they really get pissed they really get pissed it's it's not enjoyable for us it's not  something they do is not right now oh make a go make a go 10 points i like that idea you're right  about football because technically they it's only scoring basketball should be one yesterday's score  should in in the nba should have been 45 to 20 like yeah but we want it's something about more bigger 
[02:40:00]  numbers more higher three make a let me tell you something which when you're saying that an attempt  at goal it's only been 10 attempts again eight to ten make an attempt if you get to get a clean shot  off in a certain area make that count as a half a fucking point not the worst idea a goal is a full  two points an attempt an official attempt in a certain area goalie has to make the save it's a 
[02:40:30]  fucking dude yeah the only thing we care about right in a hockey game and and for people who don't like  i mean people who don't like hockey and not like soccer we do love the mano a mano all right goalie's  gonna stop you from trying to score thing oh here it is i love the and the soccer kicks i've never  seen the goalie stop that it's basically i'm going to pretend i'm kicking right and the ball will go left 
[02:41:00]  the goal is just too fucking big for him to defend the entire thing so yeah when it's just  a player against the goalie it's going in what you see that fucking english fool it just hit off  his face english his family's probably has things painted on the door that his his his  fucking sister's gonna get raped now because of that horse shit bill buckner people go oh bill you 
[02:41:30]  suck but his life he gets to live yeah in brazil if they lose one of those guys are gonna get  stabbed in the stomach kill him well that makes it a kind of a cool sport if think about this part  yes if you think about it fucking awful fans stab you imagine imagine they do that in the major  major league baseball you know come on man i i watched uh england usa and i tweeted i just watched 
[02:42:00]  this whole game i don't know if i watched a good game and i was being honest i had no idea and people  were trying to explain to me on twitter please what is this is why and even their reasoning was like one  day i want you to explain to me the what like one day i want you to explain because i have a friend  who loves baseball i just say look i'm a sports person please explain to me one day and a soccer  guy explain to me one day in the base just what is the fucking thing about soccer please tell me what  the allure is as a fan i got an open mind where i'm i i've been asking that question and i still i don't

[02:59:30]  yeah bells and whistles you can do it's just it's just a shame because you was talking about live leak  or live stream live stream what they did to him why wouldn't they work with you live stream  work with me i could bring a lot of viewers in i could bring a lot of people to come in right  and some of those people are going to start their own show a lot of yeah yeah but you know what i  fucking had to go to ustream i went to ustream and then i go to ustream and and it's like oh i could  do fucking 14.9 aspect ratio i could go widescreen i could do a few other things that i wasn't able to 
[03:00:00]  do with with live stream and i have no you know i didn't have any personal problems with live stream but  it's like you know why do i have to sit here now and have commercials thrown in every five to eight  minutes i swear every five to eight minutes my show stops and it won't work with commercial goes in  and i know it's this but you're not explaining it it's but you don't know when they're going to  throw the commercial no because at least if you knew when the commercial was going to pop you could work 
[03:00:30]  around that like we do right here like i can monitor my show and what the people are seeing on my show  as i'm doing the show right and that's usually what i do and then every five minutes it says 20  seconds to commercial and it's counting down but when i get that commercial doesn't mean everyone's  getting it they all get it at different times based on when they logged in so if i saw that and  it was all at the same time i could go all right here comes a commercial guys i'll be right back in  20 seconds you can stop and i could stop the show you can't because you're realizing at any given 
[03:01:00]  moment someone's missing what you're saying you're talking to nobody when they're showing a  commercial they're showing it to everybody that's no no that would be that would be good because at  least then i can work around it they're at any given moment someone is getting fucked they're putting  commercials on all all so how many my thing is okay when they when you leave these places  i left sprint for the same reason i i like said okay sprint go eat my dick what what did sprint do to  you um uh uh oh shit oh charge me it's simple charge me for something i downloaded that didn't 
[03:01:30]  work and i said could you just take that off take that off sorry sir which is becoming the most  egregious thing i've ever heard sorry sir i can't do that i go please take this off man i'm i'm a good  customer i'm asking you don't see me as a as a person that's trying to get over on sprint i pay my bill  come on man just take it off this is not a scam i pay a hundred and some odd dollars a month i'm 
[03:02:00]  not nigerian here yeah and they said no i go you know um i i i think i'll just get to fuck fuck you  i'll go somewhere else i i have i have the ability to leave fuck you and i'm wondering how many knees  does it have to be for the company to go oh maybe we should take we should stop being a piece of  shit we should probably start taking the shit off when they say when do they care you take the  shit off way too when do they care way too many me's have to do it yesterday just yesterday i get 
[03:02:30]  a phone call and uh it's uh cable vision and they go another gangster they go hi mr kumia wait they're  still going at it with you they go hi mr kumia they've tried this with you a few times this is even  better they go we just want to um let you know of some uh great new um options we have for you and  stuff and she's talking i go um i don't have cable vision oh they had no clue that i don't even have  the company anymore and i haven't for about six fucking months she goes oh what what do you got 
[03:03:00]  now i go i have verizon i got fios okay i got fios she goes oh and then they they got uh could i ask  you why you because i'm sure the supervisors go if someone tells says they got a different company  you ask them all the questions she goes can i ask why you left i go yeah um my picture was constantly  freezing up and pixelating and i was getting a lousy signal uh and with uh uh fios it's great it's  smooth as silk i just got i got more channels more hd channels and she goes you know a lot of times 
[03:03:30]  that's not an issue with uh she's making excuses i'm not even with them anymore and she goes sometimes  that's an individual connection with your house or something i go oh i know because i called cable  vision to come fix it three or four times and it never got fixed i go and file verizon came over  hooked me up fiber optics i have smoothest silk video now and i said when there was a problem  uh with the video and i called them up they ran another line into my house another fiber optic 
[03:04:00]  one just for video and one just for data from all the computers i have and didn't charge me extra  for it it was just because that was what i needed but you do you do realize though you'll be you're  you're on the bottom you're coming in oh i know yeah and it's just like when a pizza shop opens in  your neighborhood the the slices are as big as your fucking fucking elephant ears right  for a for a dollar 
[03:04:30]  fuck you know what god damn it patricio absolutely right  because it talks about it and talks about this files like they're they're special they're not like  me eventually you're gonna get fucked by but you know what then i hope every company deal with  i hope wait wait wait bios comes out then because i'll switch to them but what happens to the  pizza though you set up your bit there it starts with the elephant ears for a dollar right then it  slowly gets smaller for a dollar to until until it becomes minuscule for a dollar seventy five 
[03:05:00]  two dollars right less cheese less sauce less less everything when they first come around and  they and they got to do what they got to do then you got but they won't maintain they never  maintain that situation i hope there's another place that opens up i tell you one time i got  somebody on the phone i'm pretty good at getting people to be human one time i the girl goes okay  if you pay over the phone um they don't like you to pay with them they don't like you to do human  stuff anymore if you watch the supermarket there's one aisle with one person and then everybody there's

[03:16:00]  san france dude they've been there longer the first time i went to san francisco oh a chinese  girl said you're so funny and i she didn't use an fl or a r like it was like you're funny they've  been there longer than like any other place in the country thank you we talked and i said dude i'm  telling you i said look i'm not bullshitting you this may sound right where i'm from i'm at war with  asians man i'm at war with them they just won't be nice san francisco asians are the greatest asians 
[03:16:30]  i dare they're so like people i don't never have i met any other ones that's like they're a long  fucking yeah they've been there a long time i think that's what it is east coast asians like chinatown  agents just oh it's a whole nother a horrible group no idea i i i have a place that i order uh  sushi from i have it delivered you know japanese not as bad as chinese by the way i'm jumping in 
[03:17:00]  right now wait a minute right now wait a minute though i'm jumping in right now you have he has to  you have to jump in i'm jumping in right the fuck now it's still bad we're not as bad we have to explore  the fact okay that look in every group and this is i'm explaining it to people out there that wonder  why white people and black people are the only it seems that it's redundantly us talking about race  for that simple point is that we pick the color that we picked a side black and white we don't get 
[03:17:30]  into irish and italian and half barbados and half jamaica it's black versus white  right fucking chinese people every group has a white person of that group that they hate  puerto ricans are the white people of latinos because they don't have to swim here and they  treat them like shit they treat every other latino like shit because they're illegal puerto ricans  laugh at arizona because they they're not fucking right these dirty mexicans right same thing as 
[03:18:00]  japanese japanese are the white people of fucking china of asia yeah and they they  act a little sushi restaurants they have a little bit more personnel when you go to sushi restaurants  and you're having trouble those people are chinese but the that's what i'm talking about uh this this  place does both chinese and japanese and i think they have like a japanese sushi guy that makes the sushi  but everyone in charge is chinese so when i order uh first of all i i get stressed out to the point 
[03:18:30]  of like i'm sweating when i have to call the order in because i know no matter how many  fucking times i give them my goddamn address something's gonna be wrong they cannot get that  address right on the phone i'll be like blah blah blah here's my address and they give it back to me  and it's a completely different word than my street completely different word and then i'm like no that  one and and you try to get the order right with them and and it's on their menu they wrote the 
[03:19:00]  fucking thing and they're frustrated yeah yeah because they can't understand you in this great  world where we speak this language exactly i'm doing what i'm supposed to be doing and now i've been  i've been like for for years you use the same place because you just get used to it and everything  and i i always ask for extra like soy sauce oh and and and they bring me i got i got like stacks of  sushi and i got two thimbles two thimbles of fucking soy sauce am i supposed to dip all these 
[03:19:30]  california rolls and this right are you serious california rolls and it's fucking dried up even  worse though they hold back the wasabi the same way yeah it was everything did you see how much  fucking fish i ordered you fucking ass the guacamole okay how healthy as big as my fist you can't eat  sushi without the fucking without the soy sauce and one little wrap of fucking rice and salmon soaks  up all the fucking that's why you need a lot of fucking soy sauce they do it with the wasabi too 
[03:20:00]  man i don't know what the deal is is it hard to make or something no it seems like it's a cheap  fucking thing wasabi powder just in case i needed it i have wasabi in my house for the same reason  because i know they'll never give me enough you make it it's the easiest thing to make  you mother fucker it's horseradish it's it fuck yeah but until then giving you two packets was  taking care of you everything's counted they can't fucking they don't just i'll pick up a handful of  chopsticks and throw them in it's like one two four napkins four napkins but that's what they make 
[03:20:30]  them do in their country of of you know one fortune for a real sushi lady and make real sushi sandwiches  for us sandwiches  what do we have here the building blocks of sushi sushi meat peaches and guacamole  it's not that hard to let other people from other countries talk to you if they have peaches and it's 
[03:21:00]  just all peaches and cream all the time it'd just be a dessert you dongle i love guacamole it's my  favorite what's that  oh it's really hot guacamole  holy guacamole  i don't know what he's doing 
[03:21:30]  that's like an actor that has been in some great shit and john c reilly and he's doing dr steve uh  uh brawl oh my god on adult swim and it's fucking hysterical it's classic sushi sushi meat  peaches where he points to the ginger peaches and the wasabi and guacamole guacamole 
[03:22:00]  this is horseradish you're most likely to have come across it that's the powerful paste wasabi  that's eaten with sushi sushi that's eaten with sushi look i don't want to get banned by  fucking it but they have to stop man a lot of these people let me tell you dude when i was doing doing  the pilot and you know we had some racial shit going on and if you ask a foreigner to do them  them they do the they do the exact 
[03:22:30]  fucking like racist oh absolutely we do right they're exactly how they're portrayed yeah except  if they do it i can't do it because i'm i'll be a fucking piece of shit of course but they do the  stereotype they are the stereotype so so what's the harm in in doing it especially in a comedic context  uh not this hate mongering or something uh what's that crime in doing it it's just they're just

[03:23:30]  that's why again black and white people are much happier even though we're in this racial game  we're much because we fuck each other we it's like a tom and jerry we fuck each other we're like  fucking tom and jerry the roadrunner and coyote like fist fight yeah we have sex with each other white  people fuck black people mexicans indians they're just loyal to them what what how can an asian woman  be happy i've watched asian porn you know you watch porn the the little dick asian thing is an 
[03:24:00]  absolute fact i've never seen a asian guy packing wood those women have to fuck that and they're loyal  to that how can you be a happy woman indian women that have to wear that garb when it's hot oh that  whole big paisley colorful long robey thing with jewelry and the weird shoes and they turn them into  big socks indian cum that turns a woman into a pig

[03:46:00]  culture and indoors it doesn't matter if they're if they're clearing their throat they're spitting out  just like if they're they won't hold the door open for you because it's it's a waste it's considered  a waste of time wait instead of what's the waste of time holding a door like there's no politeness  because you're just i'm gonna try that one out i wonder if that's real and then if you get yelled  out you go i'm not wasting my time exactly where it goes uh i could i can wow i could relate to it  where i worked in a chinese restaurant for about four years delivering now i was considered a peasant 
[03:46:30]  because i was delivery guy but from the area i'm from from a good area and you made a lot of good money  delivering the food but once they realize like the size of your house or what you drive they treat you  like you're you're just uh you know you're you're one of them now because you have enough money  because in their country it's if you you have all the money or no money and you're treated like a  peasant well look at you trying to talk low and uh i'm at work and i don't want to be too loud  and another thing is they don't understand any type of humor like sarcasm i don't think they do 
[03:47:00]  either it doesn't relate yeah yeah it doesn't translate yeah sarcasm only thing that's funny to them is  oh no no no no fucking a girl with fucking a blurred out pussy with a rat crawling in her  asshole let me say i saw a fucking chinese thing where they had a bitch's head sticking out of  out of the floor yeah and and gave her a fucking meatloaf hat and let and let heal a monster  run around to eat the meatloaf hat and they think that's hilarious that's one of those game shows 
[03:47:30]  right they think it's hilarious yeah they're game shows they don't care if people are just about  being killed that's what they find funny though like they let people run on icebergs and let them  fall off and smash their face into one when they're trying to jump and we step one that stick the uh uh  what do they call that that show on abc oh yeah the great buns i they look i watched uh ninja warrior  and the other thing they do the great buns i you know i watch it but after a while you go  this is the meatloaf hat oh man look at this it's a pork chop there's a big fucking 
[03:48:00]  gila monster a woman in danger is hilarious in japan man oh you're out  so what's the last girl to have her head up  this is kind of genius though they're just screaming they're screaming and running away from

[03:53:00]  from brooklyn and then the other one is they have elaborate pay systems where you have to put in a  quarter to get the cart and then you get your quarter back when you take it like a fucking ride  so a lot so a quarter makes you take it back they're going to go to a dollar that'll make  you definitely take it back yeah you put it in then you get your quarter but white people's  supermarkets you know what they have they have the fucking cart return thing yeah all over the 
[03:53:30]  parking lot people bring it and they there's guys that actually go and get the carts and bring  them back and put them all over the fucking park and how wide the aisles are aren't the aisles so  wide and wide you know what just in case a nigglet wants to turn horizontal that no one has to have  a fight big large aisles nice and large it's spaghetti in the spaghetti aisle with the sauce that makes  sense wonderful very exotic and it is what it is it's just like you go there you ask usually all white  women all white women are evil yeah 30-year-old white women white guys friendly white guys and
