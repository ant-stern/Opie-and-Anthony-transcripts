<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The "After Opie and Anthony Live" broadcast with Sam Roberts covered a wide range of topics.  A significant portion focused on Roland's persistent, unconventional methods of pitching guests to Opie, including casual, almost manipulative, conversations designed to subtly suggest potential guests.  The discussion then shifted to Haley, an American Idol contestant, and speculation about a possible relationship with the winner, fueled by the observation of her eating a bagel with cream cheese outside the studio.  This transitioned into a recap of a fitness challenge between Sam Roberts and Eric, highlighting Eric's poor cardio and prompting good-natured ribbing about his weight and lack of fitness motivation.  Jim Brewerâ€™s chaotic Wildwood vacation story, filled with street brawls and a diverse, unruly crowd, was recounted. The show also touched on an unresolved conflict between Danny and Kenny and concluded with Sam's humorous misidentification of Donald Rumsfeld's position in the government.  Several members of the main Opie and Anthony team, including Eric, Roland, and Nicole, participated in the lively conversation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That's what it is.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  I, of course,  and the Sam Roberts that the production refers to.  And we, of course, are doing what we always do,  keeping the studio live, because why not?  We have the studio.  And we're going kind of inside what's going on back here 
[00:00:30]  at the old Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony, Jim, they're all gone.  They've gone home.  I saw a couple of the bosses  quickly trying to get up the hallway.  But Opie scampered out of here  before they had a chance to talk to him.  He slid right out the door  almost as soon as the mics turned off  and got out of here.  However, Roland did manage to grab him.  I saw Roland got a chance to talk to Opie.  Roland's not the type of guy  that you can brush off easily. 
[00:01:00]  When he's got business to conduct,  he's going to make sure the job  that needs to get done,  in this case, pitching guests for the show,  gets done.  Roland knows all their hiding spots  and their tricks.  So you can't fuck with Roland.  Well, because Roland, his trick,  especially with Opie, I've been noticing,  is to kind of try to get to know him  on a social level.  Go to his house.  Walk around his neighborhood.  Play with his child.  And then, you know,  in the middle of all that,  say, by the way,  what about I mention a guest pitch 
[00:01:30]  just when you think  you're having a nice dinner  or what have you with him.  We learned that, of course,  last week with the guest pitch  that Roland did  while Opie was waiting  for the hangover, too,  to start at the screening.  Roland also has this other thing now  that when he's hanging out  with Opie socially,  they'll be talking about  just random stuff  and Opie will talk about  his phone  or some new app  that he has  and then he'll go,  oh my God,  you know who else  uses that app?  And then he'll just mention  the guest name  that he's trying to get 
[00:02:00]  on the show.  It's crazy then to me  that Roland is this transparent  yet Opie still hangs out  with him  and he won't hang out  with you anymore.  Eh, whatever.  I don't like that.  I got his 200 bucks.  You know who I walked by  outside?  Oh, the American Idol girl?  Haley from American Idol.  The third place runner-up.  Haley.  Isn't there a rumor  about her?  What's the rumor?  About her and the winner?  No, not the,  what?  Oh.  That's what Roland  was telling people.  Roland talks more shit 
[00:02:30]  than anyone I've ever,  he better come in here  because he couldn't  be more wrong.  But yeah,  Haley was eating  a bagel with cream cheese.  I believe a sesame seed  bagel with cream cheese.  You know who else  was excited to see her?  That's the rumor.  You know who was  excited to see her?  Who?  Club Soda Kenny.  I know, he called me.  He was so excited  when he realized  what it was.  What rumor  are you starting  about Haley  from American Idol  and with the winner?  There's no rumor  of Haley being  with the winner.  Yeah, there is.  That's the other girl,  the second place runner-up. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, the second place.  That's the third place girl,  Haley,  that's here right now.  I thought the other  was the runner-up.  No, it's the third place  runner-up.  Oh, then,  then, yeah, no.  But I don't know  what they look like.  I don't watch  The Voice.  You're the only one.  No, no.  Everybody,  it's a new...  Nobody's watching that show.  I don't watch it.  Why?  I got sucked into it.  Like,  hit who won?  I don't just want to do it.  What was that?  Death of the Prince  of the Comic-Cready.  Oh, very nice.  He'll be in here tomorrow,  I've heard. 
[00:03:30]  Is he?  I've heard.  Yeah, he's like  my foot in his ass.  I don't understand.  If Haley from American Idol  has time to eat a bagel  outside in the hallway,  she should have time  to do a minute or two  on After Opie and Anthony Live,  don't you think?  And she has a bodyguard.  A bodyguard?  Yeah, did you see  the guy staying up there  with her?  Was he like a big,  burly guy?  Yeah, a big dude.  Why does she have  a bodyguard?  Do people want  to do her hard?  I mean, I know  she's small.  I don't know.  But I didn't realize...  I noticed  that the management  tried to grab Opie  before he left. 
[00:04:00]  He slid out.  You, however,  got him.  That's right.  Did you pitch?  You bet your sweet ass  I did.  How did it go?  It went very well.  No dick in the ass  today?  No.  Oh, excuse me.  That's necessary?  Eh.  That's the type  of show we do?  He's a married man.  That's what he does.  He can't get home  because his wife  will slap him.  Is that right, Eric?  What?  You try to get out  those male aggressive  things here because  your wife won't let  you do it at home?  No.  She just looks the  other way and rolls  her eyes.  She's disgusted by you?  Yeah.  That's awful. 
[00:04:30]  How are you feeling  after Friday, by the way?  You still a little sore?  Because let me tell you  something.  The champ.  I know.  Eric won.  Fair and square.  I mean, the push-ups  I still have some issue  with.  But Eric won the  competition.  However, after running  around the block once  and Eric technically  only running halfway  around the block,  he was panting  for a good half hour.  Dude, you gotta get  more cardio in your  workouts.  You're not a big  cardio guy, Eric, huh?  No, I'm not a big  running guy.  Anyway, I have a problem 
[00:05:00]  with body heat.  I'm very hot all the time.  Yeah.  So it takes me forever  to cool down.  That's weird, Eric.  You should see something  like the doctor about that.  You know what?  Yeah, you should too.  I know.  I'm scared.  There's actually, I just  looked it up on E-whatever,  E-medicine.  You know what that is?  What?  It's being overweight,  is what that is.  Is it?  Yeah.  Fuck them!  People who are overweight  get hot.  That's not like news. 
[00:05:30]  I hope the WikiLeaks  people hacked their website.  Was there anything, Eric,  like, you proved yourself,  you proved that you  can do push-ups,  not as good as me,  but you can do push-ups,  you proved that you  can do sit-ups,  you can do a couple dips.  Well, he did...  Mark said prison dips.  Yeah, I didn't think  those dips...  No, those were like  prison dips.  Usually the dips are where  your hands are behind  your back and you  push yourself up.  The dips he did was  like in the Stallone  Cobra when he was  in jail.  Yeah.  That's the dips he did.  I do dips like 
[00:06:00]  holding the bottom  of two chairs with my  feet on the ground  and pushing myself.  It's just like you do  with your hands behind  your back.  It's the same exercise.  But yeah, he did the dips  where you're hanging up  in the air.  Eric, were you...  I mean, you did three.  I only did two.  Yeah.  Were you sore?  No, not really.  Not from that.  What were you sore from?  I wasn't really sore.  I was just overheated and...  From the running?  Yeah.  Now, I was going to say,  I was thinking about this  over the weekend,  and after getting made 
[00:06:30]  fun of so much  for being so fat  for such a long time...  He's sitting right there.  No, I was talking to you.  Oh.  Yeah.  I was going to punch him.  Eric, don't you like  look at that and say,  okay, I am capable  of doing some exercise.  Don't point it, Roland,  when you say that.  Eric, enough deflection.  I am capable  of doing some exercise.  Oh, I know I'm capable of.  But if you did that  on a regular basis...  Come in here.  Come in here.  Nicole and Stanley T,  come in here.  Come in here.  Did you just talk to Haley? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Confirm this rumor.  Was she or was she not  eating a sesame seed  bagel for breakfast?  I saw it.  I didn't see whether  it was sesame seed,  but it was definitely  a bagel with cream cheese.  There you go.  Credibility to Sam Roberts.  How was she?  She was good.  Am I allowed to talk  on this mic?  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, you're not,  you know, you're tan,  but you're not all the way there.  She's on Ant's mic,  of course.  How come if Haley had time  to eat a bagel,  she didn't have a couple minutes  just to come on  and talk to After Opie  and Anthony Live 
[00:07:30]  with Sam Roberts?  Oh, dear.  I'm sorry.  I mean, if she was  eating breakfast out there,  Nicole, from the morning mashup.  All of them.  So you got...  Oh, I can't just grab them  at the end.  So you totally got nagged, huh?  Yeah.  They just were, like,  not happening.  I mean, Opie and Anthony  weren't taking American Idol people,  I guess, this time around.  But you would be perfect.  I would think so.  But this show didn't exist  when American Idol started.  So can't I just jump on board now?  Like, let me just get Scotty tomorrow.  Yeah, I'll give you  the person's number.  She'll set you straight.  I thought you were friends with her. 
[00:08:00]  Who?  The person who books  the American Idol people.  The fox lady?  No, the one here.  Yeah, but...  Oh, yeah, I mean,  she's fine.  But the fox lady  doesn't like the whole  Opie and Anthony thing.  Roland?  Well, it's not that  she doesn't like it, though,  but she has a set of rules.  Okay.  So you do have to take them  from the beginning?  From the beginning and now.  Why don't you just do  one question with the Idlers?  Because, listen, Nicole,  between you and me,  by the time the production  is done on Haley's One Question,  nobody will remember  who Haley is.  Okay.  When you go to TMZ 
[00:08:30]  and they say,  former Idol cast-off  was busted for this,  and you look at the picture,  don't you look at it saying,  who is that person?  Yeah, but fine,  so do one question with Scotty.  At least they'll remember him  because he was one of the winners.  Maybe I'll get Scotty McCreary.  Okay.  Don't you wish he did  maybe lock them doors  one more time?  Oh, my God.  It's the greatest thing  I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah.  For real.  For real, for real.  Can you work on Scotty McCreary  for this show, Roland?  Ew.  What do you mean, ew?  Roland's upset  because he watches The Voice  because he used to work  for Carson Daly.  No. 
[00:09:00]  That's not why?  Are you sure?  That's the reason.  It's a better show.  I was also talking to E-Rock  after the physical fitness challenge.  Oh, yeah, I heard  that you didn't do so hot, Sam.  I did fine.  I heard you didn't win.  I didn't win.  There was a little rumor  going around.  Well, there was also  a thing about the push-ups.  We won't get into it again.  Okay.  But don't you think  that after winning  a physical fitness challenge,  E-Rock should say to himself,  if I did this every day,  I could actually get into shape,  like the shape of a person.  One might think  that could be a thought  that went through his head.  Eric.  I'm not responding 
[00:09:30]  to shape of a person,  little fuck.  I just kind of threw that in.  I didn't realize  you were listening.  Eric, don't you think?  But we need motivation, though.  He doesn't want to talk to you.  He's hurt now.  Oh, somebody on  Instant Feedback,  Jordan and Scranton,  said Eric isn't a big running guy.  He's a big,  comma,  running guy.  That's not nice.  That's what he said.  Eric is not big.  Nope.  Nicole.  You call him big?  He's fat.  You call him fat?  I would, definitely.  I'm not...  Roland? 
[00:10:00]  I would call him fat.  Yes, you would, Roland.  Seriously, Eric,  why don't you exercise,  like,  even three to four times a week,  every other day?  But see,  we need incentive.  How about you could live  a healthy lifestyle  is the incentive.  And we're good  and girls would want you.  Yeah, Eric.  Look,  I don't need to worry  about girls wanting me.  That's true.  Why?  Because your wife  is disgusted by you?  I think you should be worried  about girls wanting you.  No, I'm worried  about her wanting me.  Well, you know what  she would want you  if you were in shape?  She would be like, 
[00:10:30]  oh, Eric doesn't disgust me.  How do you know  what goes on  behind closed doors  if they've got  an amazing love life?  Sam just assumes.  He sits at home...  And what he doesn't know  he makes up.  Listen,  he sits at home  playing Xbox  talking to Roland  on the headset  while she's in the bedroom  with the cat.  It's a horrible situation.  How do you know?  Eric, is that true?  I haven't done that  in a while.  A while.  Roland,  when was the last time  he was on Xbox with you?  It's been like  when since Saturday?  I'm just kidding.  Yeah, exactly.  It's a horrible situation.  I would really love  to hang out with you  but I have to pee  like a freaking racehorse. 
[00:11:00]  Go pee.  I don't mean to keep you.  I gotta take a leak.  I just wanted to find out  about Haley.  Yeah, dude.  Haley had a bagel  with cream cheese.  I knew it.  I knew it.  Eric, why don't you  get yourself in shape?  You just have to exercise  like three times a week.  Even three times a week.  Let's make a bet, though.  No, no bets.  If we lose like 40, 50 pounds.  No, because Eric  always loses bets  when it comes to weight loss.  I know, but that means  you should take...  One bet.  One.  Listen.  One bet.  I'm not making a bet  by like one or two pounds  at most.  I'm not gonna make a bet 
[00:11:30]  because it doesn't matter to me.  I would just like to see  the people I care about  taking care of their bodies.  Wait.  Alright, so if a weight challenge  or a physical whatever to you  doesn't matter to you  but when I say  it doesn't matter to me,  everybody else says  no, that's not true.  It's not a challenge.  I'm talking about  you losing weight.  Eric losing weight  doesn't matter to me.  Like, that I would bet on it.  Unless there was something...  Should it matter to me?  Yes.  Does it?  In a way.  Do I do anything about it?  Nope.  Not enough is what you're saying. 
[00:12:00]  Not enough.  It matters to you  but not nearly enough.  But wasn't it any part of you  saying,  oh man, I exercise today  and I'm capable of this.  I could really shut  a lot of people up.  Yes, because  after everything was done  on Friday  and not talking the live show  but behind the scenes work  and the weekend  and everything done  I had some time to kill  so I went downstairs  to the gym.  Did you?  Yes.  Wow.  And I went down there  for a while.  What'd you do?  Stand by the vending machine?  There's no vending machines. 
[00:12:30]  That's why you don't go anymore.  No, I went down there.  I was down there  for about 50 minutes  and then got changed  and went out.  You were just hanging out  in the locker room?  No.  Ew.  No.  He's at the juice bar.  But like, yeah.  I wish they had a juice bar.  I would be there.  But are you going to go  like regularly  or are you just going to go  like every now and then  when the mood hits?  I used to go regularly.  For like three weeks.  No, I used to go regularly  a lot.  When you were thinner?  No, even when I was heavier  I was still, 
[00:13:00]  I was going  and doing something.  I just haven't gone  in a long time.  So Friday kind of  got me back  in the mindset  of going to do it again.  Alright, it's not Tuesday.  How many times  have you gone since then?  Well, we were busy  this weekend.  You told me what you did  this weekend  while the show was on.  You sat at home.  You stayed in the apartment  for the entire weekend.  We drank and watched movies.  That's repulsive.  Well, now that I'm out  on Tuesday,  I'll go today.  You will not.  I will too.  I'm going to check in  with you tomorrow.  Okay. 
[00:13:30]  You're going today?  Yeah.  Liar.  Nah.  Are you going?  No.  You know Roland  got a new gym membership?  You did?  I did.  Are you going to  start going,  do you think?  Have you started going?  When did you get it?  I got it  last week.  Before I got sick.  Right before you got sick?  Mm-hmm.  So that was like  the end of the week?  Yeah.  And have you gone once yet?  I went once  for five minutes  seeing my card  and I left the gym.  What is a Roland  planning on doing  at the gym? 
[00:14:00]  Are you talking?  Because to me,  I would think  that you and Eric  should both be  concentrating  more on  running,  treadmill,  treadmill.  I do weights too.  Well,  because weights,  you don't need  to put on bulk.  You'd think you'd  try to get all  the weight off  and then put  the bulk back on.  You can put  the bulk on.  So what are you  planning on doing  at the gym?  I don't know.  Or maybe not even  going.  Maybe just paying  the bills.  I joined.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  All you could be  as responsible  is for the first step.  Let me get past that.  Yes.  And then we'll  deal with that.  Why don't you  look in the mirror  and then put  a picture of  yourself next  to Carmen Electra  when you were  Carson Daly's  assistant and  say,  oh,  these two people  don't even look  alike.  Yeah,  well,  that guy was  happy and then  he realizes the  business and  just sad.  Oh,  so a lot of it  is misery and  you fill in the  void that's left  by this business  with delicious 
[00:15:00]  treats.  Delicious treats.  They're always  great to eat and  everything.  Oh,  delicious meals,  steak,  and everything else.  Cheesecake.  Of course.  Do you know how  great and difficult  it is to walk  around the city  with Roland?  Because we could  be anywhere and  Roland will,  out of nowhere,  we'll be talking  about something.  He'll go,  oh,  this is great  Italian bakery  coming up.  They have the  best.  And he's listing  all these desserts  and you're like,  I can't do that.  And then we walk  a little further.  Oh,  this place has  the best pizza.  We got to go  over there.  Tell me this,  Eric.  It's the best  and the worst.  You've put on 
[00:15:30]  weight since Roland  started working  for the show  again.  I think that  might be true.  I think you've  put on considerable  weight since Roland  has started working  for the show again.  He's blaming you,  Roland.  I think Roland  got here and he  said,  oh,  I'll just get  Eric to go  with me when  I eat.  And Eric said,  oh,  if Roland's doing  it,  it's okay.  We've dined  at some fantastic  places.  Eric has a fine  palate.  Whereas before  you got here,  Eric was like,  yeah,  my wife's making  me go to see  a trainer and  I'm on the  South Beach 
[00:16:00]  diet and  none of that's  holding up  though,  huh?  That book  sucked.  I tried,  Eric had a,  Eric doesn't  have to give  a credit.  He also has  a great palate  and he has  a love for  food like  I do.  That's what  it is.  Well,  yeah,  but it's not  like a positive  thing when it's  like you're  not a healthy  weight.  Look at the  Food Network.  I mean,  that'll shift.  Let's talk  Food Network  here for a second  before we get  a break.  So,  you know,  I wanted to  play a bit.  We do have  to go.  We don't have  time. 
[00:16:30]  I've been  thinking I'm  changing some  stuff around,  was going to  exercise more,  et cetera.  Really?  Then I look on  Twitter and  Roland now calls  out Adam from  Man vs.  Food that  Roland and I  will take him  on in a two-man  tag team.  You've been  threatening the  guy from  Man vs.  Food?  Yeah.  Rolandos 99 on  Twitter.  You can check it  out.  So when you  watch Man vs.  Food,  Roland,  which is  this guy  and he goes  to various  restaurants  and he does 
[00:17:00]  the big  challenges.  Like if it's  an ice cream  place and  they have a  giant banana  split challenge  with 44  scoops of  ice cream,  he tries to  eat the  entire thing  and that's  the whole  show.  You look at  it and you  watch him on  TV going,  I could kill  him.  I could destroy  him.  Like if we  could get  Adam Richman  in here,  the type of  shit that I  was talking  about,  E-Rock and  physical fitness,  you would be  talking in the  eating challenge.  Oh, people put  away his money,  that's how  scared he'll  be to bet  against me.  He went,  it's, 
[00:17:30]  it's the  Man vs.  Food Nation.  Yeah.  He's looking  for people  to do the  challenges for  him too.  Oh, so  you're saying,  you know,  not only,  you know,  you're not  going to get  healthy,  but you're  going to  enjoy your  food and  maybe get  a little  TV time.  If it's  the cause for  delicious food,  I'm there.  Yeah, and  what's more  important to you,  the delicious  food or the  TV time?  Delicious food.  Okay, Eric?  TV time is  whatever.  Delicious food  or TV time?  That's tough  because both  are equally  enticing. 
[00:18:00]  Well, what  about the  knowledge, Eric,  that you  would look  horrible on  TV, like  you'd look  much fatter  than you  should?  That is  true.  See, it  doesn't count  as me insulting  you if you  say that is  true.  No, that  is true.  Because, you  know, you'd  be leaning  down to eat  your burger  and all your  chins would  start rolling  up under  your neck  and everything.  I wouldn't  feel bad  because I  used to have  fat people  walking around  after the  tornado.  They're not  embarrassed.  You are  self-loather  because you  laugh at  fat people.  I do. 
[00:18:30]  It's not  right.  That's how you  beat them to it.  Gotcha.  All right, Eric,  we can't play  the Jim Brewer  bit yet?  No, we do  have to break.  All right, we're  going to take a  break and when  we get back,  based on a lot  of the racial  conversation that  was going on  earlier today,  we're going to  play Jim Brewer's  Wildwood story,  the time he went  to Wildwood,  New Jersey.  Also, if we  have time, I  kind of want to  play Bobo's  breakdown that  was discussed  on the show  today.  It was only  from Friday,  but it was 
[00:19:00]  absolutely  hilarious.  I don't know  if we'll have  time.  We'll be back  with more  after Opie  and Anthony  live.  See you  this way.  The virus,  Sirius XM,  and now,  the Opie  and Anthony  show continues.  This is  after ONA  live.  All right,  we're back.  We had to  take a break.  They went  very long  today.  I think on  all their  breaks,  especially the  first two,  and so we  didn't fit in  as many breaks  as we had  to.  When that  happens,  you got to  put them 
[00:19:30]  in somewhere.  And while  we still have  some time  here on  After Opie  and Anthony  live,  we figure  we'll put  them in  here.  I'm Sam  Roberts.  I wonder  if,  what's her  name is  still around  here.  Is Haley  from American  Idol still  wandering around  here?  I haven't  seen her  lately,  no.  You think  she went  home without  saying goodbye?  Oh,  she's already  gone?  She's gone.  Oh,  man.  Oh,  well.  E-Rock  today,  oh,  first of all,  I should say,  I was getting a  bunch of,  oh, 
[00:20:00]  speaking of tweets,  before I do  that also,  a lot of  positive feedback  on the most  uncomfortable  interview special  that aired on  Monday.  If you missed  it,  you missed it.  I don't know if  we'll ever replay it  again.  I mean,  I guess we might,  but a lot of  great feedback on  that from Steve  the Whistler to  Philippe Petit to  what's-his-name  with the book  about hooking up  with girls,  Tucker Max.  Tucker Max.  I don't think  Philippe was in 
[00:20:30]  this special.  Oh,  he wasn't?  He was on the  short list.  I think we ran  out of time.  There was a  question from  one person who  asked why the  bro-cabulary  guy didn't make  the cut.  Well,  because the list  was pretty huge,  you know,  and we only had  five hours to  work with.  Don't underestimate  the amount of  uncomfortable  interviews that  we've had on  this show.  So, I mean,  there definitely  will be a  part two.  And I also got  many tweets.  Who knew that  so many of our  fans were so 
[00:21:00]  well-versed on  the workings and  the going-ons in  the government?  Because, yes,  I said on the  show that Donald  Rumsfeld was the  Secretary of State.  Iraq, you did not  correct me.  It was the  Defense.  He was Secretary  of Defense, and I  heard that  throughout.  throughout the  entire Memorial  Day holiday as  the show aired.  But, at least we  all learned  something new and  learned to pay  more attention to  our words when  they're being  broadcast.  I still, by the  way, speaking of 
[00:21:30]  tweets I got,  people were asking  me and pondering  about it, trying to  figure it out.  I don't know what  happened between  Danny and Kenny.  I don't know if it  was resolved.  I don't know if it  ever will be.  It may be one of  those things that  just sits in there  and it was what  it was, or maybe  it will unfold in  front of all of  us in the days and  weeks and months  to come, but I  have no idea where  any of it came from  still to this day.  Eric, were you  behind it?  Nope.  Do you have any  idea? 
[00:22:00]  Nope.  I don't either, but I  mean, you know, it  is what it is.  We're a close-knit  group, and staying  around the same  people for long  periods of time,  especially when you  have to wake up  early in the  morning, can lead to  outbursts on  occasion.  That was what  happened.  I don't, as I  said, I don't know  anything about it, so  stop asking me.  I'm not behind this  one, guys.  I don't know what  to tell you.  Speaking of  outbursts, though,  we had a lot of  talk about Black 
[00:22:30]  Biker Week in  Myrtle Beach on  today's show, and  Eric and me were  talking, because I  had to screen calls  today, so all of  you that called into  the show and  wondered who that  melodic voice was on  the other end of the  phone...  Or got hung up on.  Or got hung up on,  yeah, that was me.  One person did tweet  me saying, stop  hanging up on me  when I have good  things to say, and  I would like to say  to that person, I  hung up on no man  who had good things  to say today.  What about the  people who just  want to call in and  listen to the show?  Well, those people, 
[00:23:00]  at first, at the  beginning of the  show, fine, because  nobody's calling in,  but when the phone  lines are tied up,  no, you can't.  And, I mean, people  generally understand  that, except our  other phone screener,  Troy Kwan, who  spoils them.  He doesn't like to  free up lines at all  because he's a lazy  person.  It's like, wow, that  guy's been on the  phone for two hours  now.  He had an extended  Memorial Day vacation,  I suppose, because  he's not in today.  But, as I said, I  was in their  screening calls with  Eric, who was  running the board,  and we were talking  about Aunt Jim and 
[00:23:30]  Opie all talking  about the Black  Biker Week and how  you have to know  where to go and the  behavior of certain  people and this and  that and that and  this, and we agreed  that it was very  reminiscent of Jim  Brewer coming in  here.  It was just almost a  year ago.  It was just shy of a  year ago.  It'll be a year ago  next month.  And by next month,  I mean tomorrow.  Not exactly tomorrow,  but tomorrow is next  month.  You're confusing me.  I know.  I'm glad you're here  because it gauges me on  the simpleness of the 
[00:24:00]  people listening.  Yes.  Jim Brewer was in  here last June  talking about bringing  his family to  Wildwood, New  Jersey.  Yeah, and just  remember that this  story normally went  about 27 minutes.  Yeah, I mean...  fantastic story, but  we don't have that  kind of time to play  those things, so this  is a condensed  version.  We don't have time to  play those things  because we have to  spend 20 minutes  talking about Eric and  Rowan's fitness.  So please don't scream  when we don't play the  entire bit of 
[00:24:30]  something because we  just don't have the  time.  Who does?  That's not what this  is.  That's not what this  show is.  You'd be surprised.  We give you a  condensed, we give you a  concentrated version, we  keep in all the good  stuff, and if you want  to hear the full version,  you can look for it on  Audible.com or just  wait until it's part of  a Worst Of show.  It's that simple.  There you go.  But Jim Brewer brought  his family down to  Wildwood, not realizing  what time of year it  was and what to expect,  and he told the story  in a way that only Jim 
[00:25:00]  Brewer is capable of  doing, which is  excellently.  It's Jim Brewer,  possibly the world's  greatest storyteller,  and his adventure to  Wildwood, New Jersey.  After O&A Live.  You know, I'm very  open-minded, but have  you guys, you've been  to Wildwood?  I have been, actually,  yes, last year.  Many years ago.  Lately?  Last August, yeah.  Wildwood, meaning New  Jersey Shore.  The only way to blend in  there is to tattoo, I  hate whitey all over you.  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  And, uh, oh, dude, let  me tell you something.  I went to, my daughter,  North Wildwood with the  boardwalk?  Yeah.  My daughter has a  gymnastics convention,  right?  So, we're trying to get  hotels, they're all sold  out.  And everyone tells you,  eh, well, the hotels  there aren't so nice  anyway.  All right, no problem.  Go down there.  I find a condo, which is  a half a block from the  boardwalk, three blocks  from the convention  center. 
[00:26:00]  Nice.  And this is going to be  perfect.  Nice.  We show up.  There's a lot of, uh,  different groups.  Walker, we got to about  midnight on a, on a  Friday night.  Very diverse crowd.  Thank you, Anthony.  Wait, what weekend was it,  by the way?  Uh, Memorial Day.  Oh, not in Wildwood.  No.  And that's what everyone  says.  No.  But why is that?  Gang weekend in Wildwood.  Oh, shit.  That's when the gangs go  there.  Are you kidding me?  No, I'm, that's been,  that's been talked about 
[00:26:30]  for years.  It's known as gang weekend?  Gang weekend.  It was a gang weekend.  I believe it.  Check it out.  With your young family.  Oh my God.  Now I realize how much  danger I was and how  stupid I was all weekend.  Oh my.  All right.  Is it really known as gang  weekend?  I believe it is.  Yeah.  I think.  Cause I've been down there.  That's why I was surprised  by what you're saying.  It ends with cops.  There's some diversity,  but.  It ends with cops and them  explaining this to me.  However, that's interesting  you say that.  Cause I thought the cop was  just doing a cop out.  Friday night.  We get there. 
[00:27:00]  Diversity crowd, blah, blah,  blah.  Beautiful condo.  We get in a condo.  I'm always sweating out  because anywhere I gotta go,  the wife has to walk in,  look around and go,  oh yes, we're staying.  Or no, we're not.  Find a new place now.  She has to approve.  She's done that before?  Oh, of course.  Yes.  Absolutely.  There's nothing more fun  than being delayed on a plane,  taking for out of the kids  and having a breakdown.  You walk into a beautiful  sweetening.  I smell smoke.  Someone in here  has smoked before.  Or there's stains.  Or like, we're leaving. 
[00:27:30]  It's a five star.  Sweet.  Are you kidding me?  Where we going?  I want to be put up.  All right.  All right.  All right.  So, with that,  thank God,  instant relief,  I get in the condo,  we're okay.  No, I don't have a problem  with diversity.  None whatsoever.  The next day,  I notice the group  directly across the street  from me.  There's about 30 of them. 
[00:28:00]  And they're having a great time.  They're singing gospel.  Not gospel.  They're singing,  you know,  they're just singing.  R&B or something.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yeah, okay.  A lot of R&B,  a lot of this,  a lot of Latino music.  It's all good.  However,  around four o'clock,  I hear screaming,  yelling,  look out in the street.  There's about 30 of them  in the street, 
[00:28:30]  right outside my condo.  You motherfucker,  I'll kill you,  motherfucker,  I'll kill you.  You're all right.  We want a piece of this.  You man up,  man up.  I'm like,  man up.  Okay.  All right.  You know,  cops come,  cockroaches.  Back in the buildings.  Don't get too much.  We survived.  The first night,  very loud.  I can't stand white people.  Hate them.  Let's round them up  and kill them.  Hey, 
[00:29:00]  white people,  especially ones  that just got here.  All is good.  All is good.  I go on the boardwalk.  I notice,  all right,  it's a little,  I'm a little too,  uh,  um,  upper middle classed out.  So let me scale down a little  back to my roots.  I'll put on my T's,  my ACDC shirt,  little shorts.  I know.  I got no problem with this.  No problem with the diversity.  I got no tattoos.  I have no tattoos. 
[00:29:30]  I stick out big time.  Yeah.  Big time.  No tattoos.  You stick out.  All right.  I'm walking around  Sunday night.  We're leaving Monday,  Sunday night,  about seven o'clock.  You know,  class breaking.  Fuck you,  you mother.  Look out.  Full blown brawl.  Oh shit.  In the middle of the street.  There's three piles of people  getting kicked,  punched.  I'm trying to get,  the kid's like,  what's going on?  Nothing.  Don't look at this. 
[00:30:00]  Look,  who wants to play,  uh,  Candyland?  Let's,  how's him,  Coke and Pepsi,  killing each other.  Call the cops.  There's a brawl outside.  I see knives.  Cops come.  They put,  whee!  As soon as they hear the sirens,  of course,  the cockroaches go back in their,  in their business.  Which is why they put on the sirens  before they get there.  Absolutely.  So they don't have to deal with that shit.  Absolutely.  Now it's about,  nine o'clock,  ten o'clock.  Kids go to bed. 
[00:30:30]  Car pulls up outside.  You know,  now that I think about it,  this is really,  I'm really stupid for doing this,  but,  my wife,  hilarious,  she's like,  ooh,  someone's having a barbecue.  I went,  hun,  that's not barbecue,  that's pot.  And a pot is just streaming  in our,  in our condo.  And I look out,  they're all outside,  you know,  with the big cigar,  I hate white people. 
[00:31:00]  Car pulls up,  blasting.  Shaking horse,  like a dope,  I don't even think.  You know,  that's,  they're turning that down.  So I go,  oh no.  This is how people die.  Shit,  what's wrong with you?  This is how people die.  I go outside,  I go walking up,  and they're all right in the middle  of smoking a pot and all that.  And I said,  listen,  listen,  oh, 
[00:31:30]  listen,  the,  listen,  my kids are right there.  The,  the one guy's looking at me,  goes,  I'm parking.  I said,  I understand you're parking,  but you don't need the music that loud.  It's just,  I got kids.  It's just,  you go down the street and play that.  I got no problem with that.  If you go down the street and play it.  The one Latino kid,  he's,  he's had no shirt on since we got there.  And he's the main culprit for starting all the fights.  He goes,  no, 
[00:32:00]  no,  I feel him.  I feel him.  I,  it's all right.  I feel him.  He reaches in,  turns it down.  I said,  all right,  we got a connection.  We're okay.  He feels me.  I'm cool.  I wasn't a dick.  I just came out like,  listen,  man,  he turned it down.  I go back up three minutes later.  Ping,  ping,  look out.  Full blown street brawl.  Again,  the kid with no shirt has a guy in the street and he's smashing his head on the ground.  He was feeling him too.  The other guy's kicking his legs. 
[00:32:30]  And then as I look up,  there's the chicks are now fighting.  All these Latino chicks pulling hair,  screaming,  fighting.  There's a whole group of black kids coming out.  And it's,  I'm like,  this is the sickest thing I've ever seen in my life.  This is stuff you see on like police videos.  And you go,  this would never happen in the Northeast of America.  This is obviously,  again,  I call the cops.  Oh my God,  the fires,  they're killing each other.  Meanwhile,  this must go on. 
[00:33:00]  Cause every white person in the neighborhood,  and there's only like six of us,  they all hang out on their patios in the pitch dark.  Just watching.  Yeah.  Like behind towel,  you know,  they put the towels over the railings and it just,  they're peeking through.  Yeah.  And they're all just watching,  you know,  and,  and again,  cops,  turn on,  scatter like cockroaches.  Midnight,  same thing.  Fight,  killing each other,  blah,  blah,  blah.  They're beating each other against my condo. 
[00:33:30]  And I hear like,  I call the cops.  I said,  don't turn on the sirens.  They're trying to break in the condo.  That gets them to come.  They come.  So stupid the cops are or how much they don't care in Wildwood.  Cops come and they pull up to the house.  I give them the address and everything.  This is where they are.  They keep going up there and three times and the animal,  no shirt is in there.  Cop gets out.  They all come out and they start talking to the cops.  You know,  we're watching like, 
[00:34:00]  oh,  they're going to get it now.  Those little gang bangers are going to get it.  They start pointing down the street.  All the cops get in their cars and they head off the street.  Oh,  they told him,  yeah,  they went that away.  They totally diverted them.  They went that away.  You can't even make that up.  So they all take off except for one.  The one guy's parked below me and I'm,  and I,  and my wife's like,  don't stand.  I said,  no,  I'm going to tell these guys.  And my brothers are cops.  I'm going to tell them they're all in my house.  I go,  hey,  shh,  hey,  shh. 
[00:34:30]  He looks up at me.  I said,  listen,  they're all in that.  They're all in there right now.  Cause no,  it's,  it's another house up the street.  I said,  no,  I've been here for two nights.  It's that house.  They get in fights.  They wait for people to walk by.  They start the fights with them.  And the main guy is looking at me right now.  He's got no shirt on.  He's up on the top and he's right there.  But the guy saw you point at him?  Oh yeah.  Oh,  he goes,  are they,  are they black or white?  I said, 
[00:35:00]  everything.  Black,  white,  Latino,  mostly Latino.  He goes,  okay.  He gets in his car and he leaves.  Swear to God.  All right,  you know what?  Let me just get out of this place.  Let me get out of this place.  We're done.  It's Monday morning.  It's Memorial Day.  So we're leaving.  Life is good.  No worries.  I'm packing up the house.  They're all outside.  We're hanging out.  No big deal.  I have my car in the front.  I packed it. 
[00:35:30]  I have my in-laws who,  to give you a little bit of my in-laws,  I mean,  they are as white as you can be.  And as they've never seen any type of crime whatsoever,  except for on cops.  Matter of fact,  there's a joke in our house called,  where's the gun,  Jen?  Because they live almost near Pennsylvania.  And one night,  someone was banging on their door at three in the morning.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  And my father-in-law is going, 
[00:36:00]  Hey, you know,  who is it?  And they couldn't understand.  We're calling the cops.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  Open the door.  And he said,  Get the gun, Jen.  Knowing he has no gun.  But as a last resort.  And my mother-in-law goes,  What gun, Herb?  We don't have guns.  After ONA.  Live.  At least we're all richer from the experiences that we have in this world.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  We're about to wrap up. 
[00:36:30]  We don't have a lot of time.  Thank you to Jim Brewer for supplying us with that always hilarious story.  By the way,  I'll try to talk about this more tomorrow,  because it's a weird thing.  But,  as it turns out,  tomorrow night,  that's Wednesday night,  tomorrow,  I'm going to be co-hosting.  You remember Derek Poundstone,  the power lifter,  E-Rock?  Yes.  He does a radio show called Poundstone Power Radio.  It's on XM 207,  Sirius 92.  And what kind of radio show is that?  It's like a fitness radio show. 
[00:37:00]  Like,  he talks about,  like,  I don't know,  getting his life together.  I'm not quite sure.  But,  I'm going to be the guest co-host with him.  Tomorrow.  I guess he usually does it with Covino from Covino and Rich.  Covino can't come in.  So,  I'm going to be the co-host of Poundstone Power Radio tomorrow.  Fantastic.  Uh,  I'm not quite sure how it will work out,  but I'm sure that you'll all tune in in case I fail.  Uh,  which,  I never do,  except in the case of sit-ups.  7 to 9 p.m. 
[00:37:30]  Eastern tomorrow night.  We'll talk about it tomorrow to remind you.  Also,  if you want to go to the Opie and Anthony Facebook,  we have the,  uh,  photo gallery up from the Physical Fitness Challenge.  Oh,  I was looking at some of those pictures.  I look real tough in a lot of them.  The one with me doing sit-ups,  I don't like how much leg is showing.  But,  beyond that,  I like how I look.  I like how I come across.  Well, I didn't take those photos.  I know,  Roland did.  He was getting very close.  Very close.  Very close.  Listen,  I don't know what I did to upset Ronnie B,  but hopefully we can get him back in here on some day,  at some time, 
[00:38:00]  because Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Opie and Anthony,  and after Opie and Anthony Live,  continue live tomorrow.  We'll see you then.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the ONA show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  On the virus. </pre>
