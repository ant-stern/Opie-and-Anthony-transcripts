<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast featured a wide range of topics and guests.  The show began with Ron Bennington in studio, joining the hosts in a discussion about their childhoods, focusing heavily on physical discipline received from their parents and whether it constituted abuse.  Mars, a regular contributor, shared particularly graphic anecdotes about his upbringing, including being hit with a hot oiled spatula by his mother and his traumatic association with the Spanish language.  Bennington also contributed childhood stories, including his escapades stealing chair caps and his experiences with priests.  The conversation touched on the lasting emotional impact of these experiences and included numerous jokes and playful interjections from the hosts.  The segment also included reminiscences about unpleasant experiences at Radio Row and the Super Bowl.  Further anecdotes from Mars about a transgender family friend nicknamed "Wonder Woman" and his mother's use of a bedpan were also shared.  Troy Kwan's absence from the studio during this segment is noted.

Continuing the theme of familial relationships, the conversation shifted to the hosts' and Bennington's mothers' volatile personalities and their fathers' passivity. They discussed the lasting effects of feeling unloved as children and the difficulties in giving and receiving love as adults, touching upon the use of therapy to address these issues.  Extensive profanity was used throughout this segment.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to planning the on-air wedding of Fez and Patty, two recurring characters.  Bennington participated in brainstorming the details, including potential musical guests (ZZ Top, Lighthouse), the Hard Rock Cafe as a venue, and logistical aspects.  The hosts engaged in frank and sexually explicit discussions about Fez and Patty's relationship and lack of sexual experience, including jokes about Fez's anxieties and preferences, and reminisced about past segments featuring Patty, including an incident involving her wig being pulled off on the street.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about the show's future, a past expensive dinner with Don Wickland at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant (during which Opie was particularly unkind to Wickland), and a critique of the radio industry.  They criticized the lack of originality, plagiarism (citing examples like "Chuck Roast," "Sandy Beach," "Sonny Fox," "Bubba the Love Sponge," and "Kid Kelly"), and the prevalence of bought calls and pre-packaged bits. Opie expressed frustration about a lack of opportunities for new projects.  This segment included a surprise appearance by Mike Tyson, promoting his one-man show "Sway."  A substantial interview followed, covering his career, personal transformation, and reflections on boxing and MMA, including reminiscences about past fights and fighters.

Mike Tyson and his wife remained in studio for a further segment, during which the hosts discussed his calmer demeanor compared to past appearances, speculating that his wife's presence might be a factor.  The conversation covered his boxing career, including the infamous ear-biting incident with Evander Holyfield and Don King's involvement.  His financial struggles and past lavish lifestyle, including owning white tigers, were also mentioned.  David Morrissey, actor from *The Walking Dead*, then joined the show, discussing the show, his character (The Governor), the show's willingness to kill off main characters, his research into cult leaders, his background as a bartender, and the differences between American and British acting styles.  The segment also mentioned Louis C.K.'s poster controversy, Ron Bennington (who was already in studio), and a new intern.

Later segments touched upon the musical history of The Faces and Rod Stewart, further promotion for David Morrissey's show, Mike Tyson's subdued appearance, and Ron Bennington's and Jim Norton's contributions to the show.  A significant portion of the show focused on intra-office dynamics and conflicts between show staff members Sal, Roland, and Eric, highlighting communication issues and perceived laziness.  The "Line of the Day" segment featured listener submissions with commentary, mentioning Mars as a frequent contributor.  Sam Roberts engaged in an extensive discussion with Opie and Bennington about the challenges of breaking into the radio industry and the lack of investment in new talent, focusing on his own career aspirations and difficulties within SiriusXM, including a mention of his viral video from 2012 and a listener contest offering $1500, possibly involving a gay stripper and Sal.

The show concluded with a discussion about a listener, Lucas, who traveled across the country hoping to take Sal's job.  The hosts proposed a jingle-off contest to decide his suitability, with listener votes determining the winner.  The scheduling of the jingle-off was debated due to Lucas's vacation plans, and the hosts ultimately gave him a few days to prepare.  The hosts expressed skepticism about Lucas's understanding of the show, and the segment ended with an announcement that Fun and Fez would host the next day's show.  "Radio Wizard" was mentioned as a regular segment.  The overall tone throughout the broadcast was informal and included frequent instances of teasing and banter between the hosts.

I do  It gives everybody going  Yeah listen to this  You got the Grim in the Morning thing  Get up if you want to  It's Grim in the Morning  No not that  With Greg and Jim  That's just a horrible way to start a show 
[00:01:00]  No I mean the Grim in the Morning  Oh really?  Yeah where is that?  Got a nice surprise for everyone today  I'm not surprised  Surprise Jimmy!  Ron Bennington  Hi Ronnie  It's your special day  What's up Ronnie?  Hey buddy  Did you get the red carpet treatment?  Oh yeah  I told Mars to roll out the red carpet today  Well since he's abused  It's hard to find 
[00:01:30]  He's red with his beaten blood  I told him  I go man  A lot of people related to you yesterday Mars  He goes bruh  I didn't even realize I was abused  Until I saw your eyes  I'm like how do you not realize you're being abused  When you take a hot oil spatula to your hands?  But he learned  He learned  He didn't steal anymore  He did learn  Yeah  Mean but effective  The only thing that takes Mars back now is if he hears Spanish  If anyone yells in Spanish  He just starts crying  Well it now makes sense though 
[00:02:00]  Because over the years  You know we've needed the Spanish guy every once in a while  To translate something  Right  Maybe say something  And every time he tries on our show  People call up and go  He doesn't know how to speak Spanish  He speaks baby Spanish  He speaks baby Spanish  But now we know why  It sets his mom off  I  Because she only knows Spanish  I had a buddy in Florida  That I thought spoke Spanish  But when other Spanish people  They would tell me later  And he was like a big dude  They would say  He talks like a toddler  Like a little kid 
[00:02:30]  But to me it sounded like perfect  It sounded great  Yeah but it's because shit like their grandparents  Or whatever said to them  And then they got to school  Right  And that part of them never improved  Right  And they need a hot spatula in the back  Yeah right in the back of the hands  I don't know if that's abuse  Do you really think  A hot oiled spatula  I mean no one's ever died from a hot oiled spatula  Let's do it then  I want E-Rock to do it  E-Rock  We'll get a hot plate  What do you think  For Ronnie B  And the eye bag 
[00:03:00]  Oh we'll put this right up  No shit  Perfect for you  Come on let's do it for the eye bag  It's a super weak  Okay  No you'll get a couple like drops of oil  That might burn a little more than the spatula itself  The great pictures  He's thinking about it  E-Rock  Here's the thing  He's thinking about it  You know we leave here today  We're heading to New Orleans  To be part of Radio Row  And we want to show  Wait what  What's going on  Yeah we're all going  The whole station's  We're going to be in Radio Row  What really  And 150 other radio shows 
[00:03:30]  All lined up  That's my dream  We're really going  That's my dream  Have you ever done Radio Row before  Yes I have  It's the worst  We stopped doing Radio Row about  I don't know  At least  I don't know  12 years ago  Easy  It's really hard  When me and Ann first started doing radio together  We had to do a few Radio Rows  I remember we were supposed to do one  And then we got kicked off the air  We were supposed to do one in Boston  For Jim Cook  And I was so excited  Because Gene Simmons was going to be there  But then we never wound up going on 
[00:04:00]  Because we got booted off  You know what  That was the last time we did Radio Row  We did the Sam Adams Brewery  Oh yeah  With a whole bunch of other radio guys  The thing is  Is like you see Gene Simmons with everybody  Before he gets to him  And by the time he gets here  You just feel like shit  Yeah  What else does he have for us  And then there's a lot of things  Where they promise Gene Simmons  But then you get to talk to a roadie  And like  I don't know what's with Gene  He should be here  Right  It's fucking terrible  They said we were going to go to the Super Bowl this year again  And there's nothing 
[00:04:30]  Don't  Don't  It's awful  It's fucking  It's the principle though, Ronnie  No, no, no  Have you ever gone to the Super Bowl  As a radio show?  Yeah  It's fucking awful  Yeah, but I want to go once  I've never gone  Don't do it  I've been at this radio thing since I was 18  I want to go once  Go for real  And fucking just go to the Super Bowl  And SoundCloud it  Yeah  I'm going to go and just SoundCloud it  But don't fucking show up  And like  Uh, Jim Nance is running late  And there's 800 shows here 
[00:05:00]  To make it feel like you're just nobody  Of course  You know, it's like the DMV of fucking radio  And then you start interviewing janitors  And like  Yeah, anybody  And old cheerleaders  Anyone you can find  I did one at Disney  Where they kept running voices by us  You know, so like  Yeah, what do you mean?  This is the voice of whoever  What fucking cartoon character  Right  And then he would try to talk that way  Right  And then I would try to like say  So when did you start doing voices?  And he wouldn't break characters  Oh, Christ  I'm like  Oh, people at home  So you couldn't even break them down a little bit  You're not a fucking cartoon  Exactly 
[00:05:30]  E-Rock  Spatula  Hot oil  I don't know, I gotta think about that  We slap both hands  How about we slap one hand?  We slap the one hand you don't need  Did it happen to Mars every time the same way?  No  Just once  Just once and that's not abuse  You've had some shit happen to you growing up, Ronnie?  Everybody got hit, right?  Of course  It's our generation  Yeah, so why would they now turn around and call it abuse?  If everybody got it?  See, I don't know  You're the greatest, Carney  I don't even know if you're fucking with us  I mean 
[00:06:00]  A hot spatula?  Just because everyone was a slave in the 79's  Right  Doesn't mean it's no longer slavery  Yeah, but nobody knew not to  So you can't break the balls of the people at the time  Oh, look  There's YouTube videos of guys getting hit in the butt with spatulas  That's a little different  This was heated, though  Yeah  But his mom was cooking  It's not like she sat it on a pan, right?  Let's bring him in  I don't care  I mean  I almost had him crying  But I failed  Because I pointed out that he was almost crying  And that made him uber aware  Here's what 
[00:06:30]  I blew it  Here's what you say instead of crying  You just say  I know I set your eyes  I said that  There's some water in your eyes  That's what I thought would work  That should have worked  Yeah  Okay, so I didn't blow it  Because that's exactly what I said  Well, you just be comforting  Just be comforting  Like, you know, like, man  I know it's rough  But it's going to be all right  And then all of a sudden  They feel relaxed  And then they cry  And then you call them tired  Here comes Mars  And then he tells me this morning  He goes  Rah, I got so many more stories  I'm like  What were you waiting for?  Yesterday was the  Let's make everyone sad  Because Mars had a shitty live show  Hi, buddy 
[00:07:00]  Hi, buddy  How are you?  How are you feeling today?  Pretty good  You know, I tried to relate to you a little bit  When I came in  And you didn't really want to talk about  Yesterday's appearance, I noticed  I didn't know what to make of it  This morning talking to you  So I just wanted to leave it alone  I even held the door a little longer  Than I usually do  Thinking you didn't follow me in  It was awkward, I know  I didn't know if I were to say  What's wrong with you?  To say thank you  Or whatever  But I'm really nervous now  Why?  Because Ronnie's in  Because Ronnie's in  And Ronnie fucking pulls shit out of people  That's not true 
[00:07:30]  Yes, you do, sir  I'm here for you  You're the best  Just relax  You're like an interrogator  No, you're all dressed in camouflage  Like anything happens  You go into the bushes  We can't even see you, Marce  And he says you speak baby Spanish  I do  He's absolutely right  Which I think is hilarious  He's absolutely right  Yeah?  Yeah  Why don't you speak the language  If your mom only speaks Spanish?  Like I said, it tore up  I speak it tore up  But how do you have a mom or father  That you can't really communicate with?  That's strange  To me  My earlier days, yeah 
[00:08:00]  I spoke better  And as I grew up  And grew distant from them  I didn't use the language  Yeah, but you probably never  Talked to your mom  On more of a  Higher, I should say  Than a third grade level  Yeah  Absolutely right  Your entire life  That's weird  That's all she's got  Is there a lot of  No, I'm thinking that's all you got  As far as Spanish goes  That's all she's got  Trust me, it's her  It's her, she's  Wow, she's  Okay, yeah  Alright  I got you  Alright  So what do you do?

Even for that generation  Look at Ronnie  See he's not phased  He's not phased  I just feel like  You can you know  It's you're judging  Outside of the error  Right  That it took place in  You know  That back then  An extension cord though  It's the same as a belt  That's a whip  Same as a belt  I don't know  Is it the same as a belt?  Yeah  It's two different things  I would love to get hit by a belt  As opposed to being a belt  Sure  Alright well  I think I got a belt 
[00:22:00]  You're setting your fucking  So high down there  I love to get hit by a belt  Iraq would you get hit  By a belt  And an extension cord  So we can see if it's different?  Oh I don't want  You haven't done anything  For the show lately  Can I tell you something?  Troy is texting  Yeah  Saying Iraq is a pussy  And he will get hit  With a hot spatula  No he shouldn't do that shit  Troy is the fucking  Real deal man  Where's Troy?  Is he here yet?  He's here  He's here  Let's bring Troy in  And let's get the hot plate  Before fucking  Radio wizard shuts his down 
[00:22:30]  Do you like being spanked by girls or no?  No  Hell no  I don't like that shit at all  Any rough stuff?  Tie me down?  Fuck no  I don't like it  Oh yeah  I'm losing my mind bro  Here's Troy Kwonk  Yeah I'll do it  He rocks a pussy?  Yeah  It's a hot spatula in oil  And then we take it out of the fucking hot oil  And whack your hands  Just smack me in my hand?  Yeah  Yeah  That's easy right?  Yeah  Let's do it  Did your mom just let it sit there?  Morris how did it go down?  That shit was hot  It was you know  And the grease too 
[00:23:00]  Did she just hit it?  Yeah she just hit it  But the grease is important  Because the grease is what stayed on his hand and burned  You dip it in grease  Alright we got a hot plate around this joint or what?  Get some grease  We got some grease?  Grease  That's easy to get  Do you think an extension cord is worse than a belt?  Have you got hit by that?  Well a belt has a bigger surface  That's what I'm thinking  But a cord might have more of a whip type of an effect on it  There's no doubt that the cord is going to hurt  An extension cord is a motherfucker  There's metal running through the extension cord  Did you get hit with the end of it? 
[00:23:30]  Or is it just like they hold it like a belt would?  Just like a belt  Oh that's a motherfucker  It's going to come down faster too  Did it leave a mark?  Did it leave the big long line?  I left the big long line mark  Did you show it to your friends later?  Do you have any scars?  I showed you yesterday  The only scar I could come up with  I didn't see any scars  What did you show me?  I don't remember  Inside his scars are inside  Deep inside  My hair is on my hand  Oh right right  They don't grow  He can't grow  Do you ever  We shouldn't  Hey do you ever bring it up to your mom now? 
[00:24:00]  No  I have in the past  And they act like  You know  Oh well that was Dan  I was stupid  I was ignorant  You know so it's kind of  Oh there's a low acknowledgement there  What are you going to do?  Sometimes there's no acknowledgement  Yeah but they  I mean no  What would you like her to say?  Nothing  But I'm saying  If you talked about  How would you like her to react?  What would be a reaction  Where you went  Okay she kind of gets it  To stop being a fucking cunt now  And just you know  Be there for the  I don't want her on  Nothing  I want nothing  Good for you 
[00:24:30]  Mars  I really don't  Yeah stop with that shit  Stop with that  Wishing that she's going to change  She's not  The reality is  No one ever changes  No  No one ever changes  They don't  But then it's  It's up to you  Whether you accept that  Exactly  That's the fucking thing  That I don't understand  Like people are like  Oh I hit my parents  I'm going over there this weekend  Yeah  Why would you?  Why would you go to an unpleasant place?  You don't put up with it  With anyone else  No  The only  The only reason  Like I said yesterday  I put up with it now  Is because I have a lovely wife  That wants to have 
[00:25:00]  All the grandparents  She wants the perfect family  That ain't happening  Well she's living a lie  She's getting  She's getting  Yesterday I told her  About what happened here  And she was like  Dude  Really man  If you feel that way  We don't have to  Have her  Too late  You know  It took this show  For her to realize  Right  She's a nice person  No but seriously  The thing is  Is like  Opie went across for you  The way your wife should have  Okay  That's the thing  You got to let into your head  Okay  Every fucking night  When you're laying next to her  You know what I mean  Like she's asking you  Swallow some shit  So we can feel like 
[00:25:30]  We're a real family  Instead of the truth  You got a real family  It's not  You know  It's a real radio family  That's what I said  It's a real radio family  This is your fat  That's what I said  But you got a real family  Don't worry about making  Your family  Seems like you're a grounded father  And you got a good woman  And you got good kids  That's all you need  You don't  Because if you bring her around  Then there's going to be that darkness  And that  Everyone's tense  You don't need that shit  And your kids pick up on that  And granted  You know  She's getting older  Trying to get to the pearly gates  So she's fucking 
[00:26:00]  You know  Too late  You know  But she's doing  She's trying to do the right thing  Like she take  When she does have  My kids  What do you mean  She's doing the right thing  Has she removed all spatulas from our house  Yeah  Stop pissing in front of the kids  How about we start there  Yeah  How about we get rid of the bedpan  And the spatulas  Has she stopped tankling into a chock full of nuts can  Right  And how about she puts down her fists  Start there  And get rid of that old fucking stereo system  Seems to be a fucking hazard  Da da da da da da  Fucking edge of pirates flying around  Lizards on the wall 
[00:26:30]  Someone throws a quarter off the fucking cruise ship  The whole family's diving in  As fast as they can  I'm glad we were able to make the jokes today  Because yesterday was a little intense  We got some jokes in  But  Did you hear his head got  Kind of got stuck in the  Oh yeah  You remember  I was describing that big stereo  Back in the 70s  Two big speakers on either end  There was in the middle  The turntable  Radio  And then next to that  Big television  So that big whole stereo system 
[00:27:00]  When I  When she knocked me down  You know  I'm young  I don't know  I go in  With my head turned to the side  And she's mounting me  So I look at her  So now I turn my head  Upright  And I wedge my head  Underneath the stereo system  Not knowing that I could turn it back  The other way  I'm fucking nervous  Right  This bitch is trying to kill me  You know  And she's looking at me  And then she's actually  Sam asked  Like how was she hitting me  She was punching me in the face  And smiling  And going  And like with every hit  Was like  Huh  Like huh 
[00:27:30]  How about that  She hated your father  She's just bullying you  You might want to listen to Pearl Jam's Alive  Yeah  It's a whole song about that shit  Listen to that whole  Don't call me daughter bullshit  Pearl Jam's all about family abuse  You might want to go into their catalog  A little bit  I like Pearl Jam  Go listen to Alive  Imagine  You should wear shorts  Wherever you go now  Like that  Troy you ever get hit?  Is this no big deal to you?  I got hit as a kid  I mean nothing like that  Oh so you acknowledge  That Mars had a rough huh?  Oh yeah  Yeah he hit it bad 
[00:28:00]  But it's like  I guess it's like a Hispanic thing  I mean they just  They're just racist  They're crazy  Yeah that's horrible  Yeah she threw  I know we all  Maybe not Sam  Maybe you  Maybe she threw something at you  Your parents maybe  Right exactly  Nah my mom was about  Throwing my whole room out  On the driveway  But thank god she didn't throw anything  Did that mean you had to leave  Like you're supposed to leave now?  No I was supposed to clean my room  Oh okay  Great  Yeah  Did it work?  If I left shoes out  It would be the dumbest  Stupidest thing  So instead of saying 
[00:28:30]  Hey why don't you put your shoes  In the closet  No the whole room  Had to be in the  On the driveway  Yeah  Why do they care about your room?  I never understood that  Because if the doors close  Who cares?  But she  Back in the day  In the 70s  She threw a  Hairbrush at me  And the plastic back then  Was not like the plastic  We have now  A little lightweight  Plastic back then  Was fucking sturdy  You know?  Plastic today will do some damage  Okay  The bitch throws it  She misses me  You know  Back then we didn't have sheetrock  We had plaster 
[00:29:00]  She made a fucking hole  I didn't see the plastic  Coming off  You know I didn't think  Anything of it  I thought hey  She missed you know  Right  But now as I'm speaking  To you guys  I'm like you know  If she would have  Hit me with that shit  She would have fucking  Probably really caused  Some serious damage  You think she hated you  Most?  Yeah I think so  Yeah  That's the part that hurts  I still think she hates me  Yeah  She does  She has a problem with me  Do you get any love  From the older people  In your family  Like an aunt  An uncle  Yeah those people  Yeah yeah yeah  Crazy love  I had a grandma  That was amazing 
[00:29:30]  You know I have an uncle  That gives me so much love  That I think that he knows  The things that have occurred  You know  So that's kind of cool  But why wasn't he there  To fucking save you  That's the thing  Because it's his house  Yeah but the thing is  If he could  You know what I mean  Like today  If you found out  Some neighbor kid  Was getting abused  You'd go over  Where were these people  For you  That's the part that hurts  Despite all the  The nice things  That are being said  That's why  That's that thing inside you  You'll never be able  To take care of  Yeah they thought  It was the thing to do  Back then I guess  You know  I really 
[00:30:00]  I'm good with it  You're not good with it  Yes I am  Yes I am  You're fidgeting  In your pockets  You're not good  You know what I mean  It's okay  This is not a fucking safe place  I passed  Try to keep your hands still  For a minute  You're good with it  Then we'll believe  That you're good with it  You're good with it  The way Ving Rhames  Was good with it  When Bruce Willis  Came back in  Is this Armageddon  I don't know  We're in a couple films together  No this is the  Ash fuck  Sheriff  And Mars is asking  For music  For a segment 
[00:30:30]  Yeah  You want your segment produced  No no  How about the Hulk music  Why don't you play some music  You rock instead  Just sitting in there  Fucking gaining weight  No disrespect  I guess we're not doing  The spatula thing  What happened to the show  I don't know  We would have had a fucking  Hot plate fired up by now  Nobody takes you seriously  At your word  No no  That's not it  Lawyers  We're looking out for  They're not up yet  No yeah  Lawyers are still sleeping  Give a fuck  First hour  First hour  We do whatever the fuck  Right  They're still sleeping  You got 15 minutes to burn  That's right 
[00:31:00]  Why do you want to be burned  Why not  I just  I'm just tired of people  Not stepping up around here  Right  You know what I mean  Troy comes to fucking  Comes to work  Troy put a strawberry  Up his ass  What's that noise  What is that  What is that  It's your phone or something  Oh  Mars vibrate  What's going on  That's a water sound  Your phone  Yeah  Oh man  Are you trying to keep calm  Yeah right  That's it  Even the phone sets them off  Yes  It's sad  What was that  Unrelevant calls  The sound of just the fucking  Over the water 
[00:31:30]  Was that a wave  It's  You hear the  The sea  And then you hear the  Ship off shore  Go  Yeah you want to leave  Is that  No it reminds me  Of this whole family  Holding on to a door  Who's calling you  It was  One of the guys  In the shop  Don't they know  You're busy  You're being a big radio star  Right now  Nah  That shit could wait  What do they need you  To do that  What do they want  I don't know  Are they looking for  Some nuts and bolts  Or something  Yes  Probably  There you go  See Sirius is calling me now  Look  Let it go  All right 
[00:32:00]  Listen  So Troy's tired  If you want to step it up  Troy's stuck a chocolate  Covered strawberry up his ass  And Sal grabbed it  Without his hands  Yeah  That's the type of program  We're giving people these days  Well  You bring it back  The shock jock thing  Which I really appreciate  We're trying to bring back  The shock jock  Yeah bring it back  It's retro now  Try to have some fun around here  I know  I know you want to do it  In the studio  But that probably leaves a mark  And we'll probably have  Legal issues  Why are you saying that  You know what  It's Troy crime  No because Troy's not going to sue  Troy doesn't sue  Yeah Troy  Don't give a fuck  Don't give a shit  I like the other one better  Remember when I told you 
[00:32:30]  When she smacked me  In the bitter cold  Yeah  That's a good one  That's a rough one  That's a rough one man  Being slapped in the face  In the cold stinks  So what  We have to hang outside  In the cold for a while  It's not cold out today  Get our hands cold  It's like 40 today  I think  It is  And who would slap Troy  It's nice out there  Way to not bring  This up the last three days  When we were freezing  Our asses off  He waits till it's  Guammy in New York  What are we going to do 
[00:33:00]  Where's that hot plate  Where's the grease  Do we even have one  I don't even know  You have to go buy one  Maybe we can microwave  Some fucking oil  Or something  Pour it on your head  Martha Stewart's studio  But your mother  Made you a better parent  Right  Your mom made you  A better parent  Because you'll never  Do shit like that  You'll never even  Probably hit your kids  Yeah absolutely  Well  That's an interesting question  Jim Norton  Because then  He might be going  Too far the other way  Oh  Let the kids get away  Now  Now you're talking  That's sort of what  I was talking to Jimmy  About on the way home  Yeah  When you are brought up 
[00:33:30]  In a household  That's a little strange  You can do the exact same shit  Or you can go  The complete opposite way  Where they're just wild kids  No they're not wild  But they'll walk over daddy  They will right  They'll get over  See nobody respected you  Nah  Not generation before  Generation beneath  No  They understand the respect  They do respect me  But you know  They'll get  They'll get  You know  You do the timeouts  That shit don't work  But I have to do  My kid mocks me  And he goes  Over here  Like he'll point to places  Where he's supposed to sit  I'm like are you kidding 
[00:34:00]  You know what happened to us  When we didn't behave  You know what works  And then he sits there  Mocking us  Yeah sure of course  Why wouldn't he  So then we'd like  Take his chair  And we'd try to put it  In like maybe a boring room  That's the best we can do  Does he have electronics  What do you want  Leaf frogs and things like that  What do you want  To electrocute my kid  Yeah  Exactly  Get him in a tub  With that stuff  You know  The leap pads  You know  What kind of sick  Fucking thought you got now  Look it up man  I know leaf frog  What are you getting at  Tetris  You take that away from them 
[00:34:30]  I know my son  He's seven man  All I have to do  Is talk about  I'm removing your  DS  Yeah but what about  These people  In the fucking  Like you ever see  These little kids  In a restaurant  Where they're just  Screaming to fuck it up  And their parents  Are like this  Wallace  Wallace  Wallace  It doesn't happen  It doesn't happen to me  I'm like  I've actually sat in restaurants  I go like this  Hey Wallace  I'm not fucking around with you  Sit the fuck down  Because I'm not your parents  Because I can't  I don't understand  Why people let themselves  Get abused like this  You're not an equal  With those kids  No  Okay you know what works 
[00:35:00]  Absolutely works  When my kid acts up  I'm mortified  I get him out of the situation  I get so uncomfortable  That I'm bothering other people  But if your tonality changes  The kid has got to respect that  The kid has got to say  Of course  My old man's  Kind of crazy  Yeah  That's it right there  That's exactly what I do  I'm sorry  I could use like  More of a stern voice  And he'll calm down  I've realized that so far  Dude you grab him  By the bicep  Put a little squeeze  And look at him in the eyes  Where are we going with that  It's a little squeeze  What  It is  It's just a little squeeze 
[00:35:30]  A little bit  I threaten the little guy  Threaten the little guy  And I say  I will fucking kill you  Something like that  See  It's problem solved  I don't do anything  Oh man  I don't feel bad for you  You have to make him  Drink out of that coffee can  In the bedroom  Squeeze his little bicep  Oh god  Peace  That's all I have to do  Peace  Peace  He's got thumbprint  He's got thumbprint bruises  All over his arms  That's good  That's what they do  Yeah  That's the Puerto Rican way  Wow  What do you do really  You just squeeze his arm over it 
[00:36:00]  It's all in there  Peace  15 years  Mars Jr. is going to be  On a radio show  Telling stories  And you're going to be like  I didn't know  I don't understand  Why are you so upset about it  Now all I have to do  Is change my tone  And the eyes  And that's it  It's good enough  Oh god  Oh boy  How old are these kids  I'm sorry  How old are they  5, 7, and 15  What gangs are they running with  No gangs  I'm on top of them boy  I'm on top of them  Just like your mom  Was on top of you 
[00:36:30]  Giving left hooks  No  Oh boy  I'm doing rose  Everyone's looking down now  Hey you got the Puerto Rican flag there  I don't know why it's on this either  What the Ali  Float like a butterfly sweatshirt  That Jimmy's wearing  Why is that on it  I don't know  It makes no sense  Puerto Rican flag  I have no  My ex saw it  And she goes  That's a hipster sweatshirt  I'm like really  She goes yeah  It's got a Puerto Rican flag  I'm like I didn't even notice it  Makes no sense though  Maybe it was when he fought  Did Ali ever fight down there  In Puerto Rico  I'm sure he did  I don't think so either  I don't think so  I don't think he had a  He might have trained at one point 
[00:37:00]  But I don't think  That he ever had a  Did he have some Puerto Rican blood  In him maybe  A little bit  That's probably one of those  Sweatshirts they sent to Africa  You know they couldn't sell here  But you got it  No I bought it at a very hip place  Like where  Oh  I think it was Urban Outfitters  I was cold  Really  Yeah  Wow that's weird  Morris do you abuse your kids  No I do not abuse my kids  Why are you squeezing their arms  Get on top of them a little bit  No I don't get on top of them  I'm  Your words  Me too  I like how nervous he gets 
[00:37:30]  Yeah  That's great  Oh  You alright  It's unchattered waters for me  I'm chattered waters  Nobody's talking about them  Exactly  This is what you're saying  Takes a lot of bravery  I want to unshatter your teeth  To begin with  Takes a lot of bravery  If you just  Express this  It took  Like I said  It took nine years  To even bring it up  And you're kind of like  An alpha male too  So this is kind of cool  Right  To see an alpha male  Break down a little bit  That's why  He's an alpha male  He needs to protect  He can't let it happen again 
[00:38:00]  And that's why  He's always thinking  Every day he's thinking  When is something bad  Going to happen  Now do you grow up  Do you think that way  Like oh  Is something bad  Going to happen  I don't  Think most people do that  Only from six to ten  Yeah sure  Anything could  I laugh at most of the stuff  That happens around me  Because of how I was brought up  I think  You just laugh it off  Like  Yeah I've seen a lot of shit  Dumb shit  You know  Mine was more like  Mental abuse  A lot of screaming and yelling  That's rough  That's rough too  What was weird about it though 
[00:38:30]  Coming home and seeing your room  In the driveway  It's a little rough right  Why didn't you act like  Oh this is my room now  Did you have to read the comic book  Under your lap  Mom this is great  Thanks  My thing was  I realized from an early age  So I like avoided the house  As much as I could  I became a caddy  At twelve  Thirteen  And I would  I would do two loops a day  Easy  So I was there  When the sun rose 
[00:39:00]  And I was there  As the sun was setting  Did you do two bags  Or did you do one  Two bags  Now I got the herniated disc  To prove it  Yeah that was a lot of weight  For a thirteen year old  What kind of fucking man  Let a little kid  Carry two fucking bags  It was disgusting  How did you feel better  About yourself  If you're a man  Like  Okay grab both those bags  And struggle with that  Yeah and follow me  I was half the sizes  Of a lot of these golfers  At first  Yeah  It was crazy  But I enjoyed it  I enjoyed the conversation  Just being out of the house  And being on the course 
[00:39:30]  Loved the sport  You know  That was my thing  To avoid  I had siblings  That confronted him  Like that was just stupid  And then I knew at eighteen  Let's go  Let's get out of here  Let's do this  Yeah  So  But in the back of your mind  You're like  There was never any comforting time  For you either  I mean  We talk about it  I mean  If two days went by  Without some kind of drama  In my house  That was huge  Two  Two days  Barely  And that barely happened  There was always some dumb issue  It was always dumb shit 
[00:40:00]  You know  She didn't raise kids that were bad  You know  She had seven kids in the house  And none of us have any real  Like  Right  Issues or problems  You know what I mean  That deserved anything that was going down  It was always dumb shit  Like if we didn't eat our meal  That would be a problem  If we didn't eat everything on our plate  Why do you think people get into that thing  Because they like  It's like they didn't plan their life  And then they look around  And there's all these kids  And they're like  What happened to my life  That's a really good question 
[00:40:30]  In my situation  My mom has openly said this  Which is kind of fucked up  That she never wanted all those kids  Yeah  She had  She had six births  And then she had  My dad's  You know  Daughter from another marriage  So seven kids in the house  She was raised Catholic  So she did it the Catholic way  Where you don't use birth control  And you have kids  But wouldn't it  She never wanted seven kids  She tells us this  Wouldn't a mentally ill person have problems  Even if there's only two though  Like the fact is that they're crazy  So no matter what the circumstances 
[00:41:00]  They're going to be fucked up  I think so  But I think  I think  Certainly having a lot of kids  Helped it along a little bit too  You know  But yeah  She came from a weird house  Which I don't know much about  Because I don't ask the questions  Her mom was  A cunt  I will tell you that much  My mom wasn't as bad as  Her mom  You know  Her mom  Sued her  For money that she borrowed  When you know  We had the six kids  And now we got to eat  And pay the bills  So my mom  Took out a little loan  With her own mother  And they weren't paying her back 
[00:41:30]  Fast enough  And I remember that  My quote  I say quote  Because she wasn't  My grandma  Ended up suing my mom  And went through  The whole court system  Everything  Lawyers and all sorts of shit  Fucked up right  Right  It's fucked up  And it was  You know  They were in a bad spot  They needed the money  And my dad wasn't making  That much money at the time  And they were paying her back  But not good enough for her  And she didn't even need  The fucking money  And sued her own mom  So my mom  My mom actually did the right thing  She got rid of her own mom 
[00:42:00]  Early on in my life  Said you know  This is a horrendous influence  For my family  So she can't be around  So I went from like  I don't even know  I think I was  12 maybe  And then the next time  I saw her  I was like 22  23 when she was dying  In the hospital  The classic story  I tell on the air  Where she looked at me  And went oh precious  You got so  You know big  And I just looked at my mom  And said I'll be in the car  Do what you gotta do  I gave her nothing  I was like whatever  Old lady  Enjoy wherever the fuck  You're going  And that was it 
[00:42:30]  So  But she  You know  She removed her from her  From her own life  To protect our kids  But then you know  My mom did her own shit  See that's the thing  That brings it back  What is the fucking  Hardcore thing  Is it mental abuse  Or is it physical abuse  You know because  We didn't really get  The physical stuff  Right  So who had it worse  I had them both  I don't know if I've ever  Said this on the air  But my  My  My step sister  She's my sister  But for the sake  Of the argument 
[00:43:00]  She got some of the shit  The physical shit  From your mom  Yeah and I always wondered  Why we weren't getting that  Wow that's fucked up  Yeah weird shit  That's fucked up  Yeah like oatmeal  Over the head crap  Like fucking mommy deer shit  Oh yeah  Like way more physical shit  With her  And I was like wow  Is that coming our way  And it never really did  Not to that extent  But you can't have  Physical without mental  You can have mental  Without physical  But you can't have physical  Without some kind of  Mental aspect  Because you're always afraid  Absolutely  Like if you're walking  In the house  Your mother's a fucking wacko 
[00:43:30]  He's got the same thing  And he's also worried  That she's gonna punch him  In the face  It's like the same person  But you had  You had at least seven kids  To kind of spread it over  A little bit  Yeah and I always had  The feeling that my mom  This came out of therapy  Which pumped down my therapist  But I always had the feeling  That my mom could kill me  Which you know  Made it tough to sleep at night  Honestly think that you  Might die  Oh yeah  Yeah yeah yeah yeah  Yeah if the circumstances  Were right  Abso-fucking-lutely  Abso-fucking-lutely  Cause she would just  Fly off the handle  And just do crazy shit 
[00:44:00]  But I don't really remember  Physical abuse  I just don't  Then I wonder why  You were so afraid  That she would kill you  Like her mental abuse  Was just so fucking  Just a lot of screaming  And yelling all the time  And just like  Losing her shit  Throwing stuff  Like hiding in the attic  That type of thing  She hid in the attic?  Oh yeah  I found her in the attic  A couple times  Just having like  Mental breakdowns  She had mental breakdowns  A lot  And then would have to  Go away for that  So yeah  And that must have been  Nice right 
[00:44:30]  When she went away  It was  Like oh  Look I'm looking  To see if she's calling in  Yeah it was kind of nice  It was like a little vacation  And that's what it was  That's how it was told to us too  You know oh she's  Visiting a relative  She'd be gone for a little while  And she did the shock treatment  Back in the day  Wow  She did the shock treatment  When she was pregnant  With my sister  What?  Old school shock treatment  Cause now supposedly  They figure that shit out  A little better  American horror shit  Huh?  American horror shit  I don't know  That's why One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest  As brilliant as that movie is 
[00:45:00]  Is a little  You know that's a little creepy for me  Just saying the  Yeah the crazies  Because in the back of your mind  You're like  Does it go down  Another generation?  Do I have this somewhere?  Oh yeah  Fuck yeah  Is it inside my kids?  Completely  Yeah  Completely aware  You know  My wife helped me with that  And then I  You know  I've been in and out of therapy  Making sure  You know figuring this shit out  How'd your wife help you?  She just  How did she help me?  That's a great question  Just  Just being there for me  And talking about the shit 
[00:45:30]  Like she  She would acknowledge  The craziness going around  Like this is  Pretty fucking crazy right?  And then we'd just  You know  We'd start talking and stuff  Especially when she comes  From kind of a happy  Blue collar family  Yeah blue collar thing  You know  I mean  She would probably tell you  She had her own issues growing up  But I  I kind of laugh at it  Right  Cause of the  You know  But that's not fair  But you know  Where I  How I grew up  And how she grew up  I think is  You know  See that's what I mean  But she would probably argue that point  I think everyone would argue that point  Like well fuck 
[00:46:00]  We had a bed too  And this is what happened to us  Right?  Yeah I think there's a difference  Like I said  You know  In my whole neighborhood  Everybody got whacked  But we took it  Because it wasn't a big deal  Right  There wasn't any fear  It's like  I gotta be home by five  We're still playing ball  I'll go home late  And take a fucking smack  On my way in  And that'll be it  Right  And my thing was always  Just go down  Just hit the floor  Whatever happened  And I did that with my parents  I did it with cops  When a cop would start to fucking hit  When we were kids  Go right down  I would go out  And go down 
[00:46:30]  My old man used to call me the bad actor  Cause if he gave me a smack  I'd go over the fucking table  Nice  Oh  Jesus  I would come up  It was a very wrestling move  Where I was just  Acting like I was shaking it off  And then go back down  And go  That's funny right  And the same thing  If the cops start to fucking swing at people  Just don't fucking  Just go down  Yeah  And then they're like  Oh shit  Fuck  What did I do  Hurt that kid  Hey Ronnie  You ever had your mom  Come on and get you  And start smacking the shit  Out of you outside 
[00:47:00]  In the fucking street  Yeah  And then pull your ass in  And slapping you  In front of your friends  Yeah  So she humiliated you  In front of the whole neighborhood  But it was  We were accustomed to it  Because  That seems more normal  Yeah  You know  I've heard a lot of those  Types of stories  Oh mom's got in trouble  No big deal  You know  And then  You know  Willie might get in trouble tomorrow  We all  What's your penis  Willie  I understand  I understand  What did he do  Yeah  Marsh talked about him  In third person  That's funny 
[00:47:30]  Willie  Willie got me in trouble  Yeah  I'm trying to explain  My situation  A little bit  To Ronnie here  I don't know  If I'm fully explaining it  Hey  There was like  There was always  Like a sadness  There was always  Like a black cloud  There was  There was always  An issue  Over just dumb  Stuff  No one  No one really  Acted up  You know  Just normal acting up  In our family  But it was always  An extremely  Big deal  You know  If he came home 
[00:48:00]  A little drunk  Or something  At 17  18  Normal shit  Like that  It would just be  Just horrendous  A lot of just  Yelling and screaming  And my dad  You know  A great guy  But would just sit there  And just kind of  Allow her to  Run the household  Like this  You know  Everything was  A big fucking deal  It's the only way  I could explain it  Just dumb shit  That might have been  A quick little  You know  Two minute thing  Like don't do that  Or clean your room  Became this  Over the top  Fucking thing  See the weird thing  Is Fez had the same thing  Where his dad was 
[00:48:30]  Passive  Right  And his mom was aggressive  And you saw how  He turned out  Right  So you've already  I mean  Every time that he  You know  Something comes up  It'll always go back to  Well then my mom  And I'm like  Your mom isn't  Fucking here  No yeah  I'm just  I'm just  Yeah  I'm just saying  That it doesn't  Bother me to the level  It used to  For many years now  I'm just bringing it up  Because it's the discussion  Today  No but I think  The weirdest thing  About it  And people don't  Normally talk about this  But the thing that 
[00:49:00]  Hurts the most  Is  Not being loved  That when you're  Not loved enough  When you're a kid  Then that makes you  Feel like you're  Unlovable  And then you spend  The rest of your life  You can't accept  And give love  Alright here's the  Weird thing  And I don't know  If I've ever  Mentioned it on the air  I was completely  Loved by my mom  Completely  She just had a weird  Way of fucking  Showing it  Alright see that  I have no doubt  I have no doubt  That my mom  To this day  Loves the shit  Out of me  And my dad  But that takes you  That what does  Love even mean  What the hell is it 
[00:49:30]  If it's love  How come it can be  So explosive  Right  A little while later  Right  I mean and that  Adds to our fucking  Confusion  Right  That's why we go  Through life  Yeah  But I'm  Not acting the way  We should act  Yeah  That's a good point  You know  But I have no doubt  I was loved  Right  You know  She would always  Try to do the right thing  But she just had  Her own issues  That always got  In the fucking way  You know  But I mean  Christmas was  Beyond amazing  Her birthday  She fucking cooked  Every night a meal 
[00:50:00]  And we all sat down  She really did  Fucking try  Abso-fucking-lutely  But then would just  Fly off the handle  Over the dumbest shit  All the fucking time  And that's the lesson  I learned  Because for many years  That's what I did  Obviously  Everyone knows  But it's been  A few years now  Where I don't do  That shit anymore  I realize how stupid  That is  And how it actually  Hurts you  So the same way  Would be for you  Like if things  Didn't work out perfect  Everyone knows  You can fucking  Pull a million  Fucking clips of me  Losing my fucking mind 
[00:50:30]  And a lot of times  I had a good point  To make  But when you're  Yelling and screaming  And flying off the handle  No one's gonna listen to you  They're gonna  Obviously look at you  Like you're a fucking idiot  You're an asshole  You're a dick  You're a lunatic  Right  So I purposely  Purposely try not to yell  That much  And it's been  A few years now  So you then  Become your dad  Instead of your mom  Then you're your dad  You let all this stuff  Go on  But inside  No I try to like  Just handle it  From a different angle  I'm not giving up  On like 
[00:51:00]  My feelings  And you know  Things I want to express  But instead of yelling  And screaming it  I'm trying to find  Another way  Well your wife  Doesn't yell at the kid  Either  No there are times  Like I'll raise my voice  In my house  And she'll go  Stop yelling  I'm like wow  This is so not yelling  My definition of yelling  Is so different  You know  Yeah  It's interesting  I'm sorry  It's interesting how  With you  Therapy works  Because you let  You let it out  You know  It's just cool  To talk about it 
[00:51:30]  Like a lot of people  When they find a therapist  They're expecting  Some fucking  Magic cure  From the person  You're talking to  But really  They're there  Just to let  To really just listen  And let you  Just you know  Get it out  I mean  There's so many times  When I'm sitting  And talking to therapy  I go  Holy fuck  That's why I do that  Like I have the realization  She's not telling me  From a stupid textbook  What's going on  I think a good therapist  Shows up late  Like Judd Hirsch  In Ordinary People  That's what a therapist does  Yeah because of the swimming  You know  You call them on a pay phone 
[00:52:00]  You remember something  About Buck  And they show up for you  Yeah you saved yourself  Seriously you had to  But if you're  If you go  If you go to a therapist  You were the strong one  If you go to a therapist  And think she's gonna  Fucking lay out  Your plan for you  You're on  You're on the wrong path  They ask questions  That are smart  They kind of guide you  A little bit  Right  But it's very  It's very subtle  If you got a good one  Very subtle  How they guide you  With these little questions  And then you  Will go with that  That thought  Or that question 
[00:52:30]  For a while  Miles do you think  You couldn't even go  No I don't think  Speaking about it  Helps  Not me  I'm not the type  I'm not the type  To talk about something  That's  He thinks he's not white  No  Yeah that's silly  No it's  Reason being because  Everyone's the type  To talk about  What the fuck's going on  In their lives  Okay I can  Probably talk about it  But I'm saying  The end result  Will still be the same  We didn't do anything  Nothing changed  I went through the experience  So what  You don't change  You learn through this shit  You're supposed to change  You're not  The problem is a lot of people 
[00:53:00]  Ronnie's  You're gonna nod your head  Ronnie knows  You know you get in these  Situations with people  In your life  And you waste so much  Fucking time  Waiting for them to change  That's not gonna happen  You're supposed to change  You're supposed to change  How you handle that person  But talking about it  I don't know  Yeah cause you're an alpha male  You talked about it yesterday  For the first time  And it was cool  It was different  It made you feel better  It was a relief  That is possible  But I'm talking like  With relatives  She'll never change  No I know that  But she affects you to this day  We saw it yesterday 
[00:53:30]  On this show  You had tears in your eyes  That was a big moment  Did not  Nobody saw that  But I'm just saying  Nobody saw that  But it is okay  Forget about her  She'll never fucking change  She'll always be that person  I know that  But I'm just saying  Speaking about it  Doesn't really  I don't know  It doesn't do anything for me  Cause I've tried speaking about it  With other people  Did you speak about it  With your wife?  Yes  Yes in the past  But it doesn't do anything  I mean it doesn't make me feel better  It makes me angrier  When I speak  What happened yesterday  Sure yeah  I was getting fucking angry 
[00:54:00]  That's good though  What's wrong with that?  What's so good about that?  Anger is just a smokescreen Mars  It's about her  See Jimmy knows too  Feeling pain  Anger is just safe  That's a male  It's easy for us  Anger is easy  We're in control when we're angry  It's comfortable  Jimmy's right too man  And here's the transition  You're at the age now  That it's time for you to start  The warrior has to go  In a different place  And you go on  You become the wise man  You become the medicine man  This is what happened  As we evolve  As we age  You don't want to stay  In any one thing 
[00:54:30]  That's why nobody likes  A guy who's fucking 38  Running around like he's 18  Gotcha  Okay  So you've created  This warrior character  You wanted to protect  Yourself and the people around you  Now  Slowly  Surely  You move on  To become  About wisdom  And that's what you get  From understanding yourself  You get some knowledge  And not holding on to this shit  You at least get knowledge  Why this happened  And why maybe you do certain things  And then maybe you can help somebody else  Who's got a problem 
[00:55:00]  And you're like  Hey I know what you're talking about  I went through this  And this is how I came out the other side  Right now  You're just stuck  At that early part  That you wouldn't deal with  Why?  Why did this happen to me?  What did I do?  What did they do?  Why?  So you want to find that out  And you can move on  I just think I'm good with it  That's fine  That's up to you  I think I'm good with it  You're 47  You're wearing camouflage  Morris  I'll fucking knock  You're still trying to  Are you hiding from your mom? 
[00:55:30]  You think she's going to pop up?  Yes  You're going to hide behind a bush  Or something?  You're like a Puerto Rican  Clarice Starling  Right  Camouflage  That says it all  You're still trying to  Maybe she'll hit the bush  Instead of you  Oh lord  I want to make that point again  Really  I mean  You know  The people around you  That cause all this strife  They're never going to fucking change  Yeah I know that  You have to fucking change  How you deal with that shit  And I didn't know that  For many fucking years  Trust me  Many fucking years  As soon as I learned that lesson 
[00:56:00]  It made things a lot easier  I don't deal with them  I cut them off  Like have you though?  I've been trying again  They don't visit me that often  They're not around me that often  Trust me  That's how I've dealt with it  Like a cancer  Just take the shit out  Cut it off man  Don't have to look back  It doesn't hurt  I don't believe  I believe all of it  Except for the last part  It hurts where  I didn't get the love  From my fucking father  And mother  The way I should have  Like the way I love my kids  I mean sometimes 
[00:56:30]  Yeah that brings a tear  To my eyes  So if it still affects you  Like when you talk about it  Or if you still get  Really surprisingly angry at it  That means it's in there  It's almost like  You know  You don't realize  All these little poisonous  Things are buried  And then when they start  To fucking seep out  They didn't just get in there  They've been in there  The whole time  So that's what therapy does  It kind of gets rid of them  Because they kind of  I think affect us  In ways that we never know  They help us make decisions  That we never realize  They're helping us make  That's the advantage  So consciously right  Yeah  It doesn't mean that you're  Fucking  You're weighed down 
[00:57:00]  By all the time  Of course not  I guess so  When it creeps up  I smoke a bowl  I'm fine  I think that probably helps too  It does  Let the record show  Troy Kwan said  Enough of this shit  And left the studio  Yeah he's not trying to hear  This pussy talking  He's like  Fuck this pussy talking  I was ready to take  A hot spatula for you guys  But then he just stood there  Yeah  What goes on Mars  Oh my god  I thought I put it in a fire break  He didn't  Oh Mars  Why is that a different ring  Than the ocean  Because that's my daughter  Oh 
[00:57:30]  So she's a little more manic  Than the other person  Freaking out  Yeah  Daddy are you okay  You okay daddy  You sound pathetic  On the radio  Daddy how long am I  Going to be in the closet  Locked in this closet  Can I come out  He's doing stuff with his kids  He's teaching them to make zip guns  Everybody's in the garage together  It's so much fun  I'm just amazed about that chair thing  When there's so many other things  You can use for that dumb game 
[00:58:00]  No because  Oh you know what else we used  We used poker chips  You take poker chips  Wait wait  You put poker chips in you  Are you telling him to wait  Are you crazy  You take three  Right  Three what  Three poker chips  A fact  You take your bubble gum  You stick a bubble gum  You know baseball bubble gum  When it came with the baseball cards  Take that gum  And chew it up real nice  Getting good saliva'd up  And put it in between the poker chips  So they can stick together  So there's two sticks of gum  Three poker chips  So now I got this little thing like this  Look  And I 
[00:58:30]  Look  Scully away  Look man  What  I didn't grow up with a lot of money  But we didn't have to fucking  You know chew bubble gum  To make toys  Let me tell you something  That was a white kid  That told me  Did you have to chew bubble gum  To fucking make your toys  Ronnie B  Of course not  Come on  You never did shit like that  No  No  We went to play baseball  We had to  Gargle with flan  What  Flan  Right  That sounds nice actually  That sounds like something  I wouldn't mind  I'm never a fan of the flan 
[00:59:00]  It stinks  Flan's atrocious  Not a fan  No  It's awful  It just tastes wet  It's flummy  Like it was like you left it in the sink  Why is my fucking  Why is my pound cake wet  It stinks  Alright  Are we done with this shit  I hope  I'm good to go  Pussy hour over  Everybody just stopped their fucking sobbing  Well Sam wants to tell a story about one time his dad stopped a check  When he was on his way to the fucking Westchester mall  Zabit Samuel 
[00:59:30]  Sam's got his issues  We just haven't been able to get him out of him yet  I'm good  The signs are there  I'm alright  I mean I had a wonderful childhood  He wouldn't cook soup and make a salad for his wife the other night  Cause he's self centered  He's a good  Sam's a good guy  But he's selfish and extreme  Ronnie  She calls him and goes  Look I'm a little late  You know  At work  So can you start dinner  And dinner at their house is soup and a bag of lettuce  And he wouldn't start dinner  I didn't want to 
[01:00:00]  Eventually I did  Why wouldn't you want to do that  Why would I want to  It doesn't sound like a fun thing  Yeah but sometimes you gotta do things for the person you decided to spend the rest of your life with  That's what I said  Eventually  But I tried to be like  No  And she was pissed  Doesn't she do nice things for you  All the time  Do you do nice things for her  Yesterday I bought her a potato  Mmm  So  She wanted a baked potato  She got home  I mean she baked it  I didn't bake the potato  To you that's a big deal  You bought a single potato at the store  I bought two  Because I got one for me too 
[01:00:30]  Of course  Did you wrap hers or just put a little ball on it  But to Sam that's a big deal that he did that  Sure  Well she came home  Anyone else that's a throwaway  Oh you want a potato  By the way anything they eat seems to be an appetizer  It's a potato  It's a salad  It's a soup  When are you going to make it to the entrees of that family  We're simple people  Yeah I guess  Yeah  And he gave her an A&P gift card for Christmas  $50  What's tonight  Basket of bread  What are you having  Throw some cheese on that at least 
[01:01:00]  Garlic knots  Yeah we'll get Sam  One of these days we'll get Sam  We'll get you good  Nah you're getting a lot out of me  We'll get you good  Keep working  He's a very simple man  Man I'm not complicated  He has an OCD idiot  Right  That's accurate too  Why are the best radio guys like weirdos man  I think everybody's a weirdo  And only radio guys fucking  Are allowed to fucking do this 
[01:01:30]  So admit it  Yeah but I  You think  Yeah I do think that the whole concept of normal  Yeah  It's like almost the same way they lied to us about Santa Claus and Jesus  They also lied about normal  So we thought like there's a regular life  But it's really just fucked up  Yeah  People that you've ever met  But the best people I've ever met are the people who realize that  And then go on  That's why like fucking ex-addicts and ex-alcoholics  Are so much fucking cooler  Than people who never had any problems  You know because they 
[01:02:00]  Or act like they've had any problems  Because they've worked through them  Right  And they can sit around and talk with you  And yeah you're comfortable kind of exposing it and talking about it  Instead of hiding it  Right  I'm learning something today  Because over the years we talk about the greatest comics are the ones that are fucked up  I've always thought the best radio guys had a little fucked up shit going on in their lives  And you're trying to tell me that's  No I think fucked up works but then you've got to walk through it  You can't stay in that spot  Of course not  You know you can't stay in that spot  What happens if you stay in that spot 
[01:02:30]  Besides the obvious death shit if you're an addict  Yeah I mean you really become an annoying fucking person  You really are unpleasant  An asshole  Yeah  You are unpleasant  And you basically say stupid  And that's like what the addicts do is like  I was stupid for a long time  Let's go back and take a look at it  Blah blah blah  And now my life isn't so great  But it isn't because  I'm doing this anymore  You know  It's Sam's thing of  You know  I'm going to act like I don't love my wife 
[01:03:00]  Isn't that kind of funny  You know  I treat my wife very well  You just said you wouldn't start a fucking dinner for her  In that moment  I probably could have behaved a little better  What were you doing that was more important than opening up a can of soup  I absolutely wasn't doing anything  Just sitting on the couch  That wasn't the issue  Yeah that wasn't  What was the issue  I was probably playing  All kidding aside  What was the issue  Taking a shower  I just didn't want to do that  At that moment  So I said no  You dump it into a pod  You put it on real low  If you're doing a shower  But I was going to have to 
[01:03:30]  Simmer  Figured I was going to have to stir it  Well you said no  But then you kind of deep down  Knew that you'd do it  It's kind of like  Probably when you grew up  Like your mother would say no to you about something  But then she always surprised you by doing it  So you kind of liked that feeling  No  When they would say no  It wouldn't happen  But  No I mean I knew I would do it  I just said no  Were you annoyed  You play the mommy game  With your chick all the time  What's the mommy game  Well you know  You act like you're the bad boy  And you need her to get you stuff  And you know  That's the thing that you have  You kind of mommy her up a little bit 
[01:04:00]  I don't think so  Are you hoping she's your new mommy  No that I'm not  I don't need that in my life at all  What about kids for you  No  Yeah  But I mean  Maybe in  Two three years  What's your big concern there  I don't have any money  But  The other concern  The one that you're not saying  That's the only concern  I mean  That doesn't stop anyone else  By the way  It should stop some people  Yeah you will never have enough money for kids  It just doesn't happen  You just  At a fucking certain point  You're just like 
[01:04:30]  I'm gonna do it anyway  Well it's money  And it's also  I mean I don't have any  Career stability right now  I'd like a little more of that  You know  Well what are you concerned about  With the kids  What do you mean  It's the hair going down  Another fucking generation  You don't have to pick that hair out  Could you imagine  You and your chick  Had to sit there every day  And try to fucking pick that hair  That would be fucking horrific  Because she's got curly hair too  Not as curly as mine  But  Yeah your kid's gonna have wild hair  Oh it's gonna look like  Juan Epstein  She saw like a  Mixed 
[01:05:00]  Like albino looking kid  In the mall  With a giant  Bleach blonde afro  And got freaked out  Because she was like  I imagine  That's what our kids  Are gonna look like  How are you gonna get  Blonde hair out of you two  Oh it's probably not blonde  But it'll be you know  I want him to be even light  No I think it'll be dark  However very curly  Unless it's an albino  If it's albino  Then it'll definitely be light  Man those albinos  Will take you back every time  Holy fuck  I saw one in Time Warner  During Christmas  I fucking started following him around  I was like  Yeah  I felt like it was like  An exotic creature 
[01:05:30]  Hey  Is that bad to say  No  You were following him  I absolutely was following him  I was amazed by this  It is out of the norm  Completely out of the norm  You don't see many  No  I saw  The weirdest thing  Is a black albino kid  I saw him in Mississippi  When I was a little kid  And I've never  It was like  Our car was pulling up  And the kid ran in front of the car  And the lights hit him  It was like  And to this day  That fucking memory  Comes back  I just see these pink eyes  And this 
[01:06:00]  It was like  Sam's hair  But fucking white  Black person  But really  Pale and white  Right  That's my fucking  Silence of the lambs moment  It was back  No matter what happened  You saw a rat person  Or something  It was fucking phenomenal  And now I'm always on the lookout  For black albinos  Let's just google it  I want to see it in real life  Yeah that's too easy  Bring one on the show  I want to come up  I want to come up on it  In the wild again  I want to repeat that  In its natural habitat 
[01:06:30]  Yeah  That shock  It's like being on safari  Well why don't we take a break  Ronnie B's here  I wanted to make it a surprise  It's always fun to have a little surprise  The iBang  At the iBang  On Twitter  Thanks for inviting me in today  I know I had to bitch about it on the air before  I don't know what to do with the Fez bit  I gotta be honest with you  We'll talk about that when you get back  Yeah people are trying to get me involved  I don't know  This might be yours  This might be all yours  I'm not going to support it if it's just mine 
[01:07:00]  Really?  Yeah it's just  It's too weird  Can you at least explain it to me after the break?  I sort of know  But I'm saying that for the radio audience  We'll talk about it when we get back  Alright we're going to explain that  The Opie and Anthony Show  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony Show

[01:08:00]  They only keep it in storage for Oprah  When she comes here  But how about we give it to Ronnie too  She still have a channel here?

Yeah Oprah has a channel  Is it good?  No she just has her friends doing shows  Sucks  But she doesn't even have the other one  Her old best friend right?

Yeah  Oh god  When Oprah was here  They got her her own elevator though  I know  Like the elevator waited for her  Yeah we weren't allowed to look at her  You remember?  Yeah I saw her  You saw her?  Yeah  She dropped it  She was eating a cracker  A piece of it fell out  And I gave it to Dave  And he saved it  I don't know whether it's still around  But he was very proud of his Oprah cracker  Yeah and they rerun like a bunch of old Oprah shows 
[01:09:00]  That must be great  Just the audio  You know  Alright here's the Paddy Fez thing  Oh right so  Okay  Five years ago  On the show  They both said if they weren't with anyone  On that date  In five years  They would get married  And who kept track of the date?  One of our producers kept it  Just had it  Hiding it in his back pocket?  Yeah  So  We replayed it for them 
[01:09:30]  We surprised them  We replayed it for them  And they agreed  That they would get married  With the possibility that they could get divorced  Or annulled later  Right  It's up to them  But they would get married on the air  Now I'm here to say that  You know  Ronnie's good at the old work  But you're not going to allow them to have a fake marriage  No  I know that  I know that much about you  Sometimes you're hard to figure out  But I know that much  I think it would be funnier  If they were forced to get married 
[01:10:00]  And stay married  And then work their way out of it  And then have to figure out how they get a divorce  Or whatever  I don't know if they would  Because they're kind of perfect for each other  Right  They're too middle-aged  Too elderly  Middle-aged  Asexuals  Is Fez asexual  Is he like a sexual anorexic  He's never had sex  In his life  So he's not officially  Really?  Gay, right?  Yeah  He has gay thoughts  See, he claims that he is gay  And I say that he's  Since he hasn't done anything gay 
[01:10:30]  I think officially you're not gay  Unless you do some gay stuff, right?  Didn't he date someone?  No  We saw the make-out thing with Apollo  Yeah, but that was  And why would Fez allow the old cold sore to  Fez don't give a fuck  If it's a bed, he don't give a fuck  I'm still horrified by those pictures  I'm not horrified that  That two men are going at it  I was more horrified  Than at the fucking cold sore  He only did it to fucking annoy  This Catholic friend of ours  I can't keep up  Why?  What happened to the Catholic friend? 
[01:11:00]  That he walked in  And that they were  Oh, I see  Because I got you  And he fucking showed his true colors  Right  That day  But no, Fez  Has never done anything gay  But I asked the guy from Al-Q  Can you be gay?  And he goes  All you have to do is say you're gay  Okay  And then you're gay  Alright  Yeah, I guess so  It depends on what you feel  If your whole life  All you think of is men  And you fantasize about men  And your love fantasies  Are all about men  Just because you haven't fucked  Doesn't mean that you're not gay 
[01:11:30]  So is a gay asexual?  Maybe  Or a gay sexual anorexic  As they say  What's the gay version?  I've never heard the anorexic  Yeah, why the anorexic thing?  I've just  I've heard that term  I think it's something to do  With somebody who's just  Absolute  It's probably like asexual  But somebody who has  A sexual preference  And just kind of  You know  Voices himself of it  That's what I think it is  Okay  And Patty's never had sex  Never had sex  No, the thing is  The weird thing about Fez  Is he's been offered sex  Right  He could have sex 
[01:12:00]  No, he doesn't  He said what he really wants  Is love  That's what Patty says  Yeah  They're very similar  Bullshit  Because Patty keeps saying  She's never had  Yeah  Patty said she's  Never had sex  Because she's waiting  For the right person  And all that crap  And so Fez  He definitely wants to have sex  So what's holding him back?  He finds it gross  I think  The thought  Of a penis  Coming near him  I think grosses him  He's never sucked a dick?  No  Jesus  What kind of friend 
[01:12:30]  Are you, Ronnie?  I would  I would write it up  Oh, you mean  Put my own dick on top?  No, no, no  Just fucking  Send it up for the poor guy  Because in that case  Probably a bad one  No, I've offered many times  I mean  This is New York City  We could have sex for him  In fucking ten minutes  Really?  But he says no  Is he worried about diseases?  He's worried about diseases  He's worried about being stabbed  By a mean gay  He's worried about diseases  But the Apollo  With the cold sore on his lip  It was okay  The Apollo with the cold sore  Was a bit 
[01:13:00]  That he could run with  And feel good about himself  Oh  The cold sore is rough though  It was an angle  Oh  Alright, so they're gonna  Definitely get married  When is this going down?  This is up to you  Because you would be  The mother of the bride  And we would put this whole thing  Hard rock Johnny  So we could do it  At the hard rock  Name the day  Name the time  Why am I still connected  With Stalker Patty?  Because you invented her, dude  You brought her to the world  She was living in our studio  For a while  This is your way  Of saying  See, we have a lot  Of new listeners  They don't even know  Half of it 
[01:13:30]  With Stalker Patty  It all started with her  Giving us cookies  And we've been with her  Ever since  That's been a long time  And then she got kicked  Out of her apartment  And she was living  Under the stairs  At NEW for real  And they were cool  With that until  Well, they weren't cool  With that  But then they finally  Kicked her out  Because they found out  About it  Remember the mattress  Under the stairs  With her stupid  Stuffed animal  Because I used to  We used to actually  Get off work  And have to be quiet  As we walked by  Not to wake her up  Because I was doing  A night shift  And I would be like  She's Patty sleeping 
[01:14:00]  And people would be like  This is my work  Can't be fucking quiet  More seriously  Because I just wanted her  To get her rest  And we blew up her spot  I believe  Yeah, you did  There was a chance  Where she could have  Worked it out  With her landlord  Or her roommate  I forget exactly  I haven't thought about this  In years  And of course  She blew it up  For the radio show  People were really mad  And then we were stuck  We're like  Well, I guess  You could sleep here  For a while  The two things  That I think  That you ever  Turn the audience  Against you  There were a lot 
[01:14:30]  Of people mad  Over that  She lost her place  Over our show  But then when she  Got the wig  Pulled off on 57th  Like when I came in  Later  People were still  Calling  That was fucked up  That sucked  Like they were  Really for some reason  Mad about the wig  That's probably  The number one  As far as  Things I've done  Because she was  Screaming  Please don't  Like she  She broke character  Right  And was just  Begging as a person  She said something like  Everyone's gonna laugh at me  Do we have any of those  Clips there  I know someone posted 
[01:15:00]  Posted on Twitter  A few days ago  Matter of fact  But then you know  Then I'm in a spot  Do I say what happened  After the bit  I'd rather let the bit  Just sit there  Yeah let it sit there  Because you know  You could say what  Happened afterward  To show that you're  Absolutely a human being  In the end  But that doesn't  That doesn't make for  Good radio does it  No  I think that this wedding  You know  It's up to you  You are father  The bride on this  But this wedding  Would take us 
[01:15:30]  Full  Ronnie you don't think  It's funny that  They're gonna end up  Married  Yeah I think it's  Hilarious  You know  Because people  No because people  Were saying to me  They're like  Look it's gonna be  Some dumb fake  I'm like no  Ronnie would never  Accept a fake marriage  This will be a real marriage  Right  And he didn't really  Want to  And Casey didn't want to  And now they couldn't  Be any happier  Are they happy together  Oh yeah  They got two kids together  Sam has found  Just in case 
[01:16:00]  You think we're lying  Here today  A picture of  Stalker Patty  This has gotta be  I would say  Wow at this point  We gotta say  Eleven years ago  Maybe twelve years ago  Her sleeping on a couch  Under the stairs  At NAW  And short haired  I guess  Oh yeah  Because she shaved  Her head a couple times  For the show  Boy a fucking NAW  Looks like shit  No kidding  I forgot about  Shaving her head  Every once in a while  She would finally  Grow it all back  And that's when  We said 
[01:16:30]  Alright  Time to shave it again  We had to make up  Four hours  What are you gonna do  So what's the  Timetable on this  We'll do it  Like April or something  At the Hard Rock  Old school  Johnny wants to do it  We could do it  Any time of the day  Skinny Johnny  Oh yeah  He's very thin now  Is he creepy thin  You know  The thing about him  Is that  Remember he was always  He's a fun jolly guy  Yeah  Not anymore  Really  He's just like  Hey  Things have gotta run  Perfectly  Oh really  Yeah  And he's got all kinds 
[01:17:00]  Of chicks on the side  No  Yeah and he's  Fucking doing coke now  No  Changed a lot  Like everything we  Liked about him  Has changed  How much weight  Has he lost  He's lost  Hundreds  Hundreds of pounds  Oh good for him  200 easy  Yeah  Well it's not  He got the  Surgery  Well that's still good  He's also on the  Apnea mask too  Is he off that  It was a weight thing  Yeah it was a weight thing  Yeah he sleeps like a baby  But he actually got  He didn't just get  He didn't get a band 
[01:17:30]  He actually got it all cut out  Wait  He got his stomach  What's the difference  Well your stomach is now gone  When you have the band  It's just like fooling yourself  But with this  They went in and cut out  Like I don't know  80% of his stomach  Or whatever  And so he just  That's scary  His stomach is just the size  Of like a quarter  That's scary  So what does he eat  Like what is he  Like a couple of  Helpings of soup  And then like a little  No that would be far too much  He would throw up  And have diarrhea from that  They had a peanut yesterday  But he broke it up 
[01:18:00]  Over three meals  But it really is  How you eat  You know  You just sit there  With just like a pixie stick  That's rough  That's scary  To just decide  I'm going to remove  Most of my stomach  You can't go back  That is fucking scary  No you can't go back  Can it expand  The little piecey  The little change  Percy left  See that would be interesting  That's a really good thing  I bet you it would expand  I bet you it expands  To how much  I don't know  But  Is he a big  Like when you get the surgery  Obviously the band  Is much less of a surgery  Than the other one 
[01:18:30]  In the band  They just go in  And put something around it  Yeah the band  They just go in  And tie it off  And kind of  Fucking fool your stomach  And then you have  Another part of your stomach  That just does it  Just sits in like  An empty garage  Yeah just like  The old garage  Really  Getting all fucking  And moldy  And dusty  Yeah  That can't be good  If it's not being used  It seems like it's good  Right  Does he have a big scar  No because they  They go in just through  These tiny things right now  They do all that  I thought it was all  A giant scar  In the middle  They do all that surgery  Now with tiny little  Fucking  I didn't know that 
[01:19:00]  They barely  Cut you open  Didn't Steve see  Have a big scar from his  Well yeah but he did it  Years ago  Things change so much man  Steve did it 10-12 years ago  Probably at this point  Suck it out  It's like they put  A little fucking hose in you  Yep  And suck it all out  Are you awake  No  I'm just kidding  I just wanted to ask  A really dumb question  Same day surgery  So what else is going to  Happen with this wedding  Is it  I mean we got to have  Some festivities  Don't we  Well it looks like  Loverboy  Is going to play  But I think we can  Get some big bands 
[01:19:30]  Sam has a connection  With Loverboy  I know he has a connection  With Loverboy  Yeah we were talking about it  Do you remember  For Dave's wedding  That we played  Some of those games  And stuff  Some newlywed type games  It was fun  Yeah  We do a bunch  Of that kind of stuff  And go old school  With this  Alright  And maybe do a deal  Where we do it  In the afternoon  Right  So everybody can  Sleep in that day  Will I have any  Legal obligations  If I give away Patty  I think that  You know  I mean  To me  I love the fact  Now that you're  Going to walk her  Down the aisle  I would 
[01:20:00]  Oh man  Yes  You should do that  Alright I'm in  I mean seriously  I'm in  I'm in  I'm in  I'm in officially  Alright I'm going to  Get them on top of  Who's marrying them  Ancestor  The same person  Dawn will be  The go to  Dawn will be there  Okay  Has she married anyone  Since Casey and Dave  That's a really good question  But I think  I think she's done it  For some listeners  Yeah  Now did she marry  Sam  Did she marry you guys  No  But see Sam 
[01:20:30]  Because he paid so much  Attention to his wedding  You were coming up  With a lot of stuff  That we're going to need  Yeah  I mean  You're talking about  The cake is very important  Yeah  What kind of cake  It can't be just a  Run of the mill wedding cake  Well with those  Those probably got to be  Some kind of fucking  Diet cake right  Yeah  Some kind of  Diabetes cake  You have to  You have to figure out  What you're going to do  With the vows  I'm not eating a diabetes cake  If I'm going to be  Well then  For them  For the rest of us  It could be something  Entertaining  For them  Would you rather  No  It's like a  One big flan 
[01:21:00]  Jimmy explained that  To me today  Yeah  Yeah  Now you wanted  Who kid  To spin a little bit  Yeah as a DJ  And we could even do  A band DJ combo  Because you got to  Get people on the dance floor  Why don't we get  One of these DJs  That actually draws though  Like a fucking  Danger Mouse  Or one of those  Kind of things  I mean we got  Steve Leeds  On this now  Yeah we got Leeds  And he wants to  Bring in  If we could get like  Skrillex or something  But for the band  Leeds brought this name up 
[01:21:30]  To me  And I don't even want  To put it out there  ZZ Top  ZZ Top  If we have ZZ Top  Nice  At the Hard Rock  How  And here they come  Yeah  Maybe we southern  Webbing his thing up  They can change the lyrics  A little bit  He's got stents  The thing is  I don't want him  Defined just by his stents  No  That's what I worry about  What about Lighthouse  I don't think  That band's doing anything  Can we get Lighthouse  Now we're on to Lighthouse  Maybe a little Lighthouse  Into ZZ Top  All right  I mean this could  Lighthouse will warm up  The room for ZZ  This could become  That type of day 
[01:22:00]  Now what time of day  Do you want to do it  Oh boy  First thing in the morning  I'm at my best  You really want to do it  No no  Of course not  6am  3 o'clock in the afternoon  Like at 3 o'clock  I could have just said 3pm  Maybe we do a pre-show before  You had mentioned  Doing the bachelor party  Immediately before the wedding  That might be a lot of fun  Yeah  Oh wow  And it gives us a chance  To gay slash tranny  It up a little bit  Exactly  I'm not going to argue  Tranny action  Makes any wedding better  Who knows that  Oh my god  A Fez bachelor party 
[01:22:30]  Why are we talking about this  Like it's real  It's real  I know it's real  But it  Okay  Do we have a date  So I can mark it off  In my calendar  April something  We're going to probably  We're going to need  A little time to put it together  Spectacular  But I really want it  To be the type of wedding  That people will never forget  As long as they live  I mean I want to take  The weddings that you guys have  And just blow it away  Wow  Wow  Damn it  Your chicks furious  Damn it  That they didn't get that  We both had wonderful weddings  That's a lot of work 
[01:23:00]  Who had a better wedding  I mean  Ope has that money  Ope's wedding was fantastic  Yours in the barn  Was pretty nice  Yeah  Sam's was very good  I'm not even making a joke  I liked it  I think we did a great job  I'm not a wedding hall  Wedding guy anymore  Ope had the best one  I ever went to  Sam's was right up there  I think Nolan  From the Comedy Cellar  Had the second best  And yours might have been third  Yours was really great  Third best wedding  That's pretty good  I like a wedding  In a firehouse  I think that's the way  An Elk's Lodge 
[01:23:30]  That's the Philly way  Yeah way old school  Been in a lot of those  Situations  I've seen weddings  In the last eight years  In Philly  You're there at the reception  And the fucking thing  Goes off  And the  Because it's a volunteer  Fireman  A lot of like  The wedding party  Runs and jumps on the truck  And goes off  But then everyone's like  Yeah we're gonna do this  Anyway though  We don't need them  What else do we really need  To make this family  I mean  I think we need a really big band  Two willing participants  They both want to  Alright have you talked  To Stark or Patty  Yeah I had them both 
[01:24:00]  On the show  They realized  They made a deal  Five years  Yeah  This is like a deal  With the devil  Yeah  And five years  They said  You know how these  Fucking people  That don't want to  Do anything  Are like five years  Great  Yeah my life  Will turn around  Yeah  You don't think  Twice about it  When it came up  Fez was pissed  But agreed to it  And Patty then  Gave in  To it  Because she did  Make a deal  I saw Fez  Get down on one knee  Yeah  And with a bottom  Of a paper cup  With a hole punch 
[01:24:30]  Through it  Proposed to her  Yeah that's  Oh you saw the whole thing  Yes  Is there a ring  No we're gonna need  What the fuck  Steven Singer  What is he waiting for  Yeah we're getting  We're getting on  Steven Singer  What was the cup for  We used that  For a temporary ring  Oh okay  No we need  We need an actual ring  Right  I mean we didn't  Have one at that day  Well how about  Steven Singer  Gets one up here pronto  What I'd like to see  Them do is get a  Diamond chip  I think that would  Be really nice  Maybe a pre-engagement  Diamond chip  Into a diamond 
[01:25:00]  Yeah  But the beauty  Of this is  When this is done  I think they could  End up  Feeling comfortable  Because Patty said  She is okay  With him still  Trying to  Go out and be gay  It's gonna be  Somewhat of an open  An open marriage  With two fucking  Versions  They both go out  I want us to see  No one  Just striking out  Over and over  And over  And over again  There is between  The two of them  Over a hundred  Years of virginity  Wow 
[01:25:30]  Yeah  Now here's a question  Are you  Are you  Officially married  If you  Don't have  The old sex  Absolutely  Well that could  Lead to an annulment  That could lead  To the annulment  Because I think  That's grounds  For annulment  Yeah  But are you  So you're officially  Married  But you have to  Have the sex  I think  Right  See that's a  Technical  That's a  Technical question  Does anyone know  No you don't have to  They call it  Consummating the marriage  But the marriage  Is still intact  And it's only 
[01:26:00]  Gonna null and void  The marriage  If one of the people  Complains about  Either cruel and unusual  Or it's  If both are happy  With it  It's unusual  Yeah  But it's not cruel  So they will  Officially be married  No matter what  But what I would  Like to do then  Because you raise  But shouldn't you  Force them to have  Sex one time  Well we could do  What the Apaches  Used to do  Yeah  Where you have to  Come out with a rug  With the blood on it  And then everybody  Starts to cheer  So throw that  Whoever catches it  Is the next  We won't even know  Who the blood is from  That's the beauty of it  Or 
[01:26:30]  If it finally uses  That piss pump of his  He's gotta push  Some blood through there  What's  He's got a piss pump  That's what he  Calls his fucking cock  Because it hasn't  Been used for  Any other purposes  Does it get hard  At least  He says no  Not really  Because  He doesn't jerk off  Well he's on a lot  Of fucking meds  But has he ever  Jerked off  He claims he has  Claims but you don't  Believe  I don't believe  Anything he says  A good jerk  Is good though  Right  Oh yeah  That's amazing  I don't think 
[01:27:00]  That he has the drive  The sexual drive  Ever  No he said  Even when he was  Younger  It's one of the  Reasons why  He didn't even  He was never even  Curious  And he actually  Says one of the  Things that keeps  Him from having sex  Is performance  Anxiety  And I'm like  Dude  You know the gay  Thing  You suck a cock  Or you give up  The asshole  They'll be very  Happy  Probably very happy  Not having to make  You cum  Or you can just  Jerk off while they  Play with your nipples  Like have some kind  Of a sexual activity  And then build from there 
[01:27:30]  You don't even have to  Perform  How do people  Don't have a sex drive  So  I don't know  You know  Some people can't  See color  So who knows  You know what I mean  Who knows  That's so weird though  Are we sending him  On a nice honeymoon  After the wedding  Um  Staten Island's beautiful  That time of year  I'll throw in a few bucks  For a honeymoon  No we should send him  To like one of those  Swinger places  Where everybody just  Goes and fucks  While those two  Will just sit there  And they'll kind of  Become like the mayor  And the mayor's wife  Hedonism  Yeah  Hedonism  There you go  Imagine them  And hedonism  Yeah  First of all 
[01:28:00]  Imagine either one  Of them in the sun  Right  Fucking burning up  That sex drive thing  Even as a teenager  Fez just didn't  Do what we all did  Nothing  Nothing  Not at all  Has he ever  Has he ever  Came  Yeah  Yeah  He claims that he has  He says it's not all that  You know  Pleasurable  I disagree  Yeah coming  Is fucking great 
[01:28:30]  Yeah  It's awesome  Pleasurable  All right Dr. Steve  Hi y'all  Has  This is the same thing always  Has Fez ever had his  Testosterone checked  Oh god  That is all shit  Way to take the sex  Out of our fucking show  No here's the thing  He always takes the sexiness  Out of his  He thinks testosterone  Solves everything  Right  Yeah  Right  Why do we all get the same text  Like we usually do  It's always the  Why didn't he just give that one to you  It's always the advice show too  With Fezzy  Where everyone feels like 
[01:29:00]  They're gonna have that one thing  That's gonna make him normal  But he's not  You know  He's not a regular guy  But maybe when he settles down  With Patty  That's the difference  That he hasn't found that one person  Like he's got  You know  The thing is  She's been there all the time  Sam  She's been there all the time  Aren't they always right under your nose  Yeah  You know  This is a great love story  It is  It really is a great love story  And maybe  Two radio shows coming together  For love  Yeah  Coming together for love  And showing that 
[01:29:30]  If you're a good person  And you wait long enough  Yeah  That  The right person will come  The right person will be there  You're just desserts  You'll get  Yeah  Sometimes true love  Just finds you  In the form of an audio clip  From five years ago  Where you made an agreement  Well how many hours of vacation time  Has Patty built up  In the last four years  That's  See  Their honeymoon might be  Only a couple hours long  Yeah  You're right  That'll be  That'll still seem really long  For Fez  Get a  I don't know 
[01:30:00]  An hourly rate  Motel for them  She actually  For their honeymoon  When we were in D.C.  She flew down to Sayas  And it was the first time  On the plane  And they actually did  The announcement  That the woman  Like yelling  And pointing out the window  Yelling  This is a miracle  And how old was she  She was  40 at least  No  She was well into her 50s then  I don't know  How old is she now  Does anyone know  I think she's 6-0  She turned 6-0  Yeah I'm pretty sure she has  Wow  We used to say  50 year old virgin 
[01:30:30]  Have we been saying that  For 10 years  Yeah  Holy  Is she 60 man  I think she is  She has good tits  For an older 6 year old  Never seen her next in a while  So is Fez though  I mean  To be totally honest  Those are untouched too  I don't know  I think they really  Could end up being happy  I really believe that  What do you think  Fez would want sexually  Would he want his nipples  Sucked or his ass  Played with  Like what do you think  He would desire  If he could have it  I think  That the  Thought of that  Makes him shake 
[01:31:00]  Like a puppy  Like I  Like he could  Intellectualize  Like  Cause you know  We turned him on  To Russian  Fucking rape porn  So he's kind of  Gotten into that  A little bit  Just  That type of thing  But in real life  He never makes  The  Attempt for it  Who does he like  In the Russian rape porn  Who does he  Who does he  See himself as  I think he sees himself  As the rapey  Yeah  The victim  Will Taddy be the rapist  I'm speechless

[01:34:30]  The air after  Not doing radio  For over two years  And it was a bomb  Yeah it was terrible  It was horrendous  What about the Hoboken guy  That used to always write into him  Dan from Hoboken  Yeah he was fucking great  I forgot about him  I forgot about him  And also  Brother John was his name  Or uh  Used to call in  Yeah John  Brother  Was it John  Father John  Brother John  Wow you're  Yeah man  What about  Old Dirty  OD  Oh yeah  I was confused  For the real Old Dirty  But it was our Old Dirty

So maybe we do  Like a  Hunting  Oh sorry  Maybe we do some kind  Of homecoming  Slash wedding  Yeah  Bring back some of the  Old  The old scores  Lady Diane Marion 
[01:35:30]  Could be the flower girls  Wow I forgot about them too  What a shame  That they're not around  They were so good  Colin Quinn was obsessed  With them  Yeah  I'll say it every time  Their names come up  He couldn't get enough of them  They were strong  They were strong  The retarded  Laverne and Shirley  At the MTV Music Awards  I'll never forget it  Yeah they blew a Mick Jagger  Picture for me  Those fucking dunces  Mick walked over  And said hello to us  And I shook his hand  And I was going to get a picture  And they're like  How are you  And he fucking walked away  I wanted to murder them both  Part of our negotiations 
[01:36:00]  Because we weren't  We weren't happy  With the company at the time  So they  So they gave us  You know a new deal  And then they're like  And on top of it  We're going to give you  Your own spot  For the MTV Music Awards  The rest of the press  Are going to be in a chorale  But you guys are going to  Have your own spot  Because we own the whole  Fucking thing  Because they owned MTV as well  And then what do we do  We turn around and say  Well we're not going to  Interview anybody  We'll be there  But we're going to let  Laverne and Shirley do it  And man they did not  Disappoint  Yeah  It's one of my favorite  Favorite fucking  They asked him 
[01:36:30]  When I was a radio  They asked him of Dale Earnhardt's  Fucking son  And walked by  And they asked him  About his father  Sorry about your father  Right  It was so uncomfortable  They were comparing  Dresses with people  And what they were wearing  With what the stars  Were wearing  Did they look nice  They thought they looked  Like fucking rock stars  Yes  They got their hair did  And they got  Fucking special dresses  It was all  The lead up to the thing  Was this fun radio too  Alright so the thing is  We can't see any of those  People before that day though  We just got to bring them out  You don't think we should 
[01:37:00]  Bring them on in an interview  No  No that day  Like before we do the wedding  And just have them  Just keep coming out  And it'll be like  Some weird fucking  Where are they now show  Limo Anthony  Now they're coming back to me  We used to throw darts  At his back for plugs  Troy would do that though  That's easy  Yeah  No yeah  That's why we didn't care  Guy wanted plugs  So we said  Alright let us throw  Darts at your back  Every dart that sticks  In your back  Will allow you  To plug your company  And that was the days  Where we just  We didn't need any help  We decided that 
[01:37:30]  If the dart hit the spine  That could be bad  So we gave him  Some cardboard  Down his back  To make sure  The spine was protected  Uncle John was the guy  By the way  Uncle John  Very good  Yes  Yeah we didn't need  Fucking lawyers back then  We took care of our own shit  Yeah it all worked out great  Yeah  That was a good run  That was a hell of a run  What are you gonna do  It was a fucking historic run  How come that book's  Never been written  That's a very good question  Cause I don't know  Where to begin  With that shit  We've had offers too  We've had big offers 
[01:38:00]  That would have been  A great  Easy book  Yeah  We should look into that again  Absolutely  Anybody want some grapes  Well  Big boy got grapes  Big boy got cancer fighters  Alright so  Ron Bennington in studio  From  The iBang  On twitter  You got the big wedding  With stalker patty  And fez  They'll be talking  About that  I'm sure  A lot  They'll be talking  About it more today  Starting at 11  Yeah sure  Alright  And I'm in 
[01:38:30]  Fuck it  Good  We're gonna do it  We're gonna do it big  And but  Sam  Who's the person  To run  The thing  Down the hall  Who do we want  To go to  Is it Gary  Is it Rob  Do we go  Right to the  I think  The guy  Who's gonna  Actually have  Passion for this  Is Rob  Cross  I think  He's the guy  Rob never likes  To stick his neck  Out though  And he's still  An intern  That could be  A problem  The people  Down the hall  Well 
[01:39:00]  E-Rock knows  What you don't  No  It wasn't that  But I'm saying  He's still with  The company  Why don't we  Reach out  To Don Wicklin  And see if he  Wants to do  This all over again  Well  Wick he was  The person  Who  But  Here's the problem  He spent  So much  Money  On Dave's  Thing  That Elo  Honestly wanted  To kill him  How much  That wouldn't  Cost  It was like  25-30 G's  Above  Above  Oh wow  Over cost  Of what his  Budget was  But he was  Putting out  For stuff  Like 
[01:39:30]  You know  Tablecloths  And flowers  And all that  Kind of shit  You could really  Probably get  From listeners  You know  You don't really  Have to go in pocket  I mean  You know  We are gonna  Have to do  A live read  At the end of it  And then he  Sent him to  Vegas  Just as a thing  And then he  Bought a bunch  Of fucking  Hotel rooms  In New York  Which are always  Like $3.50  A piece  And he had  A block of them  For the family  Meanwhile  He could've done it  In Jersey  And just paid 
[01:40:00]  For like a van  To take him in  It would've been  A lot cheaper  Right  There's ways around  That  There is ways around  We really wanna bring  Don Wickland  Back into the war  Though  I don't know  I think he's  Gonna bring all  These old people  He's very happy  These days  He's very happy  Living his life  With the broad  Minded girls  He's the big cheese  Down there probably  Yeah  They all  Ask Wickie  Yeah  They all respect him  Everyone's nice to him  When he takes him  Out to dinner  Not like Opie  Was that night  Opie wasn't nice to him  He made him cry  He did  What 
[01:40:30]  That night  That he took us  All out to dinner  And you said  I gotta sit next to Ron  So I get somebody  To talk radio with  I look over  And it looked like  He was shot  Like he was  Taking us out  On his dime  Right  I was very excited  I'm like  Cool  Me and Ron  We'll talk a little bit  We'll have some nice food  Yeah but you know  Wickie always had a thing  For you  He cared about you  Very much  Well his chick said  Do you know  How many times  He'll come home upset  And ready to cry  Because of the way  You treated him that day  And Opie just laughed  Fucking laughed 
[01:41:00]  That was before therapy  I just want  And that was like  I just want to say  You treat Gary worse  Than you treated Don  Oh fuck Gary  Who's Gary  There's not enough therapy  Why can't Gary run with this  And we don't trust him  Maybe Gary can  Why don't we ask him  He doesn't really know  What he's doing  He's not a passionate guy  He doesn't really know  What he's doing  That's the problem  Maybe we need somebody  Straight out of like  The PR department  For this  You know  Nothing  They bungle everything  They're not good 
[01:41:30]  Did you enjoy that dinner  Well I enjoyed  What happened that night  Yeah  Brown Wickland  Saved up all his money  What restaurant  Was it again  It was London  He paid for the whole thing  I should probably  Write him a check  You know  The London restaurant  I don't even know  If it's still there  But it's owned  By the English guy  Who yells at it  Gordon Ramsay  Right  So not only  Did we go there  And I think it was  Like one of the weird holidays  I think it was around  Valentine's Day  It might have been  Valentine's Day 
[01:42:00]  I think this was his  Gift to his wife  For Valentine's Day  Alright  So you know  That's always extra  And then he tagged us  You know  He threw us in  And then we ate at the chef's table  In the kitchen  And you brought your girls  Yeah  Yeah we had this  So you're eating  In front of  Where they're preparing it  And the chef brings it over to you  Not fucking waiters  Wow  And explains what you're eating  And stuff  And the first thing I remember  It was fucking hot  All he bitched about 
[01:42:30]  Was the heat  And he had to wear a jacket  And he came in in a jacket  Seriously  Like when you make  A 7th grader wear a jacket  The whole time  He's just  I don't get this  This is fucking  This is bullshit  I mean right  Coming through the door  And then  All he bitched about  Was the heat  Because we were in the kitchen  It was hot  That sounds like  An awful place to sit  It was hot  Most  The booth itself  Was terrific  You know  All the kind of food lovers  Would jack over this  Of course  And they honestly said  If you want to come over  And learn to cook with us 
[01:43:00]  You can  It should be like  Roland's paradise  Oh Roland would love it  My brother would have loved it  Because he's a chef  I love the experience  Don't get me wrong  But he was bitching about  The heat the whole time  He bitched about everything  It was just so  It was hot  Fucking  Funny mean  And he wouldn't even sit next to Don  No  Don was on  It was me  And then three chicks  And then Don  Because we were in this  Circular fucking table  He had the worst seat in the house  He wasn't with the dudes  No  No  He wasn't with the dudes 
[01:43:30]  And he wanted to be so bad  Like he was  He was peeking over  And the booth was  Big enough  It was pretty much  As big as where we're sitting now  So you couldn't really  Just have a conversation with Don  He would have to lean over  Or get up  Just to talk to us  Were you watching people  Just walk in  And take orders  From the salads  Out to other people  In the kitchen  It was terrible  No  It was cool  I can't  I can't make believe  It was like  It was really cool  It was one of those shows  It was like  And I was being funny mean  Because I was getting  Some great reactions  Out of Ronnie  So I was like  All right  I'm going to go with this 
[01:44:00]  Because it's too much fun  But the reason he set this whole thing up  And like you said  Had to save up his money  Was because he's thinking  You know what  It'll be worth it  I'll be able to make that personal connection  With Opie  I've been looking to make  It was very nice  All he said  He even told us  He goes  Every day  He tries to make Opie happy  And it's impossible  And Opie just sat there  Bullying him  So you would laugh  And I did  I did laugh  Because it was  Overly funny  To see  Either  I mean  Don't you think it's funny  When a man's like  I want another man's approval 
[01:44:30]  Of course it is  I mean no no  I don't think any of us  Can relate to that  Can we  No  No  And when someone is  When someone is purposely  Trying to make you happy  That's like awkward  Of course I'm not going to go with that  Why would I go with that  You can relate to it Jim  Sure  Like when he offered  To share his banana  With Gene Simmons  Yeah absolutely  I've had my share  A pathetic moment  Sure  But it's like  Always those comics  That always say  How all they wanted  Was a smile  From Johnny Carson  You ever see those guys  They'd be like  You know like Letterman  If he talks  And then I made  And then Carson 
[01:45:00]  Gave me a thumbs up  You're like  Why would you give me a thumbs up  Oh you don't like that  No I don't understand  I think if you're a comic  I can understand  I think they're just the honest ones  I think other comedians  Would have desperately wanted that  But thought it was cooler  To say that they didn't  Letterman is probably  Just being honest about it  Because if you were on  The Tonight Show  You wanted Carson to laugh  Or thumbs up  They honestly wanted  His approval so much  And that's the way  Wiki was looking like  Here's my set  And there's Carson over there  And he won't  He says it's too hot  But I think as a man  You smell that shit  And it kind of 
[01:45:30]  Is a turn off  Right  It's homoerotic  Yeah well  Well it depends on  The kind of person you are  If you have compassion  And decency  You just treat the person nicely  Who's trying to make you feel good  I love Don  I look back  I look back fondly  Yeah he was a soldier  He was great  He was absolutely  A fucking soldier  I would have him  Over these dummies  Down the hall  So funny  Yeah  I would have told him  That when it mattered  I know  Exactly  At the time  I know  You were sitting there  Shitting on Wickland  All the time  But he got it  And he understood  Like when we needed shit 
[01:46:00]  He would do anything to get  These guys are worse  Ah they're just  They're just  You know  They're a waste  Ronnie doesn't even know  Their names  He doesn't even know  Their names  That's how much of a waste  They are in his life  The thing is  Don loved radio  Yes  He did love radio  You think these other guys  Loved the corporation maybe  Yeah  He loved radio  The way E-Rock  Loves radio  Yes  Yes  And you don't run into  A lot of guys like that anymore  That honestly love Ronnie  A handful  These guys don't even like  This radio show  So  You know that right 
[01:46:30]  They don't like this radio show  This is not their thing  Which ones don't like it  I would say all of them  Wow  I think Steve Blatter  Has got an appreciation for it now  But going into it  He definitely didn't like this  Yeah there's a lot of stuff  He finds his tasteful  I think Rob enjoys the show  Rob but he's  Yeah Rob might  Rob's just kind of like  A creepy Gollum character  He just kind of hunches  Over the fucking computer  Nobody knows what he's doing  But he'll always survive  But he's still an intern right  No he's full  Management  Now Rob is 
[01:47:00]  I think Rob likes radio  A lot  He's a radio guy  But most of those guys  Would rather plug in music  I think  Fuck yeah  I hear Gary  Like knows how to do music  And shit  So good for him  He should do more of that  Yeah Rob likes radio  He doesn't like taking risks  So  No one  No one in this day and age  Wants to take risks  Oh I know  What was his radio name?  Chuck Roast  What?  He was Chuck Roast  When he was on that  At K-Rock in LA  When this discussion comes up 
[01:47:30]  I have to sit out  Chuck Roast?  Just say some ugly things  No I have to sit out  Because my name's Opie  Oh  That's cool  Opie's not great  But Chuck Roast  Is  It could be the worst thing  I've ever heard  And it's not like  When he was a kid  People were calling him  Chuck Roast  No  Mine is based on my  Childhood nickname  Sorry  I got a slight pass  You do come across  These guys that come up  With their own radio names  And they are douchey  Do you have him saying  He's Chuck Roast?  Eric?  Sorry I was getting  The Chuck Roast demo 
[01:48:00]  If you wanted to hear that  Oh that's what I was asking for  Yeah  Wow Jesus  That will never happen again  What about the guys  Who actually just took  Somebody else's name in radio?  A lot of guys like that  Yeah  I knew Sandy Beach  Was one of those big names  That everyone took  Sandy Beach?  Yep  That was a big one  How fucking terrible  Ronnie can help me with this  I'll give you one that works  Here's Sonny Fox  Sonny Fox is a biggie  Yeah that's around  Sonny Fox  Don Steele's  Don Steele's a good one  I didn't know that  Yeah  Didn't a few guys try 
[01:48:30]  The Bubba the Love Sponge too?  Scott Shannon did it in LA  Shannon yeah  Ripped off Bubba's name  He stunted it there  And then Z100  Used it for one of their  Promotions guys  That's why Bubba  Had to copyright it  Because people were using  Bubba the Love Sponge  In different markets  That really sucks  That you know  You fucking make something up  And then other people are like  Hey that's so great  I'll do it too  Yeah  What unoriginal  Fucking hacks  Radio is full of  Terrible  It's really full of  Unoriginal  Uncreative  Fucking hack  Zilches  Who fucking  Snivel about where they are 
[01:49:00]  None of them are funny  Or forthcoming  Oh fuck them  I'm trying to remember  Some more of these radio names  Eric said that  Do you know any  Scott Shannon changed Todd's name  You said right  Oh yeah  Before Scott and Todd started  When he took Todd from Albany  When Todd started in New York  He called him Ross London  So it was Scott and Ross  So people would think it was  The Scott and Ross  From when he was at Z100  Ross Britton right  Yeah  Ross Britton  Ross  What a fucking hack  Yeah 
[01:49:30]  They all did it man  It was so  It seemed familiar  And people would come back  To listen to them  How about you just be good  At what you do  And if they listen  They listen  Well  Maybe that's not the right attitude  That's not how it was done  Back then  That's fucking embarrassing  God I remember  All these radio names  A lot of people use Steel  Steel was a biggie  St. James Steel  Don Steel  Yeah just a lot of  Rock radio was  Just filled with people  I don't think  Kid Kelly's the only  Kid Kelly  Kid Kelly I think is one  I think you're right about that  What are some other names  Yeah he had a trade market  Kid 
[01:50:00]  Because other people  Tried to do it  Yeah he has a copyright on it  Steel was a big  There are other kids  But they're  Kid Craddock  Kid Leo  Kid Leo yeah  Why Kid  Because it's young  It's hip  It's now  Yeah  Then later that became  College Boy  Where they would just  Call the young guy  College Boy  Yeah  Yeah that's right  You always expect  Kid something  To be younger  Someone's saying  Dusty Street  Is another name  I don't know  I don't know  If I know  A lot of those  I don't know  I know Dusty Rhodes 
[01:50:30]  But  Another one  Was Magic Matt  But you know  Even the term zoo  Wasn't even franchised  They just stole that  From each other  So everybody  Act like  Well we'll just  Call ourselves the zoo  A morning zoo  Doing really good  In the other town  I wouldn't  But they were also  Owned by the same company  They're just shameless  Thieving hacks  I don't think so  Because Shannon  Would  Want it  That was one of the  Big mistakes  Yeah he left Tampa  With it  He left Tampa  With it  But when he brought  It to New York  That company 
[01:51:00]  He was with  Put it in Houston  Put it in Philly  Put it everywhere  Remember  Pig Radio  Anyone  Power Pig  Power Pig  Power Pig  Power Pig  We're going crazy  We just  We just took  In a regular car  And fucking  Painted pig on it  We're driving  Around town  We're the  Power Pig  I fucking  Knew a guy  That his show  Got beat by  The Power Pig  And he  He was like  Very big top 40  He got knocked out 
[01:51:30]  By the Power Pig  Then he went to  Another town  After he got beat up  And he tried to  Start to power cow  And do it  The same shit  He did not  The same shit  That was done to him  That beat him  Yeah he started  Doing other people  Radio people  Their idea  Of an idea  Is I just heard something  Right  And I'm going to  Fucking do it myself  And they used to  Get away with murder  Because if they  Just happened to travel  Because the radio  Was so local  Right  And then you would go  Oh I heard something  Cool over here  And then you go  Back to your dumb  Little town 
[01:52:00]  And started it up  The  And they got away  With it for a long time  Before the  You know the internet  And all the social  Network  Yeah a lot of guys  Would have the same  Carrier  I'm trying to think  Of some of those  Fucking things  That they would buy  Remember like comedy  Oh yeah  Well Larry the cable guy  Was a huge one  Yeah Larry started  With me  Larry actually  Is a friend of mine  Oh really  Did he officially  Start with you  Yeah  And he was  He hadn't even  Done radio  What was his bit  On radio again  Was it Larry the cable guy 
[01:52:30]  Yeah he became  Larry the cable guy  Like that  And then he  Franchised it out  What would he do  He would call in  As just a local  Cable guy  I mean he  He made it a  Fucking job  Calling in  Different shows  Yeah but a lot  Of people have done that  Now here's the thing  Too that you will  Hear everywhere  That that bit  Of I'm giving  A phone call  Would you call  My wife  Yeah yeah  Those are all  Bought  Fucking  Yeah  Those are all  Bought calls  Right  Yeah  And they actually  Even the fact  That people go viral  And put them on 
[01:53:00]  YouTube  They still  People are so  Fucking stupid  They still believe  Well we played  Ryan Seacrest  Here's Ryan Seacrest  He makes probably  A hundred million dollars  A year to do radio  And he did  The War of the Roses  Yeah  And his fucking call  On the internet  Went viral  And we played it here  We were so uncomfortable  At how fake it was  And we couldn't believe  People were buying  Into this thing  And he was pushing forward  Like look at this  Great piece of fucking  Radio I did  Unbelievable  I guess  Why couldn't you  Take that concept  And then try to spin it 
[01:53:30]  And at least make it  Your own  Somehow  Wait you can buy  Those calls  All of them  Every one of them  Because you cannot  Put those calls  On the air  You're not allowed  To do that anymore  On radio  Well you remember  We did  When we were doing  Jacktober  There was that  Carmen Calls bit  Right  Where's this character  Carmen  Yeah she did  And then we did it  We looked and  I mean dozens  Of radio stations  Are using the same service  All buying those same calls  What's it called  The radio  Where do you steal the bit  You steal the thing  Oh bit board  There used to be 
[01:54:00]  Bit board  No no no no  A prep burger  No no the  This is the radio  Oh the fugitive  Fugitive  Every year  A different channel  Why couldn't you take that concept  Get some creative people  In the room  And go alright  This is what everyone else  Is doing  How do we make it our own  At least do that  See here's what the problem is  It never starts with the PD's  That the PD's are so  Fucking rats  That they don't train young guys  To write  They don't train young guys  To fucking care  The difference between 
[01:54:30]  I think radio and comedy  Is that you take some places  And there were older guys  That would say  Anyone who steals bits  I don't give a fuck  How big your laughs are  You're not getting on  In this room  And that  Brought like a certain  Integrity to stand up  Where PD's are like  We don't give a fuck  If you steal from us  You're stealing twice  And feeling like  That's okay  And there was never  Any integrity  To radio  Because they never  Saw themselves as an art form  And the program director 
[01:55:00]  That was a loose title  Because they didn't really  Program anything  They looked at charts  And they also had a consultant  That came in and told them  What to do  And they would follow  Exactly what the consultant  Told them  So really  They were babysitters  They were absolutely  Babysitters  I never came across  One program director  In all my years  That had a creative bone  In his body  Not a one  And it continues to this day  Sorry to those guys  But you know  It's still nonsense  After all these years  I never listened to 
[01:55:30]  One of those fucking guys  Well all those guys  The fucking people  That they should have been  Working with  From the beginning  Were like fucking  Sam and Dave  And all the young guys  Right  To say look  Here's what we're  Going to start doing  So you can write material  And you can come up  With things  And book differently  Instead of falling  Into that really easy thing  Man you make a great point  Because we do have  Young talent around here  As much as we beat  The shit out of these guys  Right  Young talent  That's so young though  And not so young anymore  Used to be younger  No why not so young anymore  Because they never took you aside 
[01:56:00]  Because they don't have  And I say this  And make people laugh  But they don't have  The skill set  To sit a young Sam down  You know when you were  Fucking green  And go alright  Let's develop you  They don't have any vision  No one has developed  Anybody around here  No there's not one  We've been here eight years  And now you're a 30 year old man  Still waiting for a fucking break  There is no sense  Of developing our own talent  No sense of like  What happens when  The established guys leave  None  There's going to be a panic  Years ago  I fucking said this 
[01:56:30]  To CBS  I said what we should do  Is take a young  Fucking  All the young guys  In the country  And put them in one market  Right  And make it  Almost like  A 24 hour  Fucking  Morning show  Fucking place  Where the young guys  Have to go in there  And in two  Three years  Start to roll them out  And just send them  To different cities  And put your best  Fucking talent  Make it like it's a triple A thing  Right  And fucking have those guys 
[01:57:00]  Do that  And they went  Well that would take money though  And I go  But you know the money  That you're going to make  Back  Exactly  It's an investment  You'd be able to  It's the same thing  The A&R guys would do  Years ago  When they would fucking  Grab people  When they were young  And the first couple albums  Wouldn't sell big  And the third one would  Sure  But the problem is  You put guys in that situation  Which  And I love the idea by the way  But as soon as the ratings  Don't come in  Within a month  They panic  And go  Alright let's  Turn this into a country station  You would have that 
[01:57:30]  In a fucking market  That you didn't give a fuck  About  So fucking small  And CBS had those markets  Yeah  Yeah  There would always be  An Akron  Or some fucking  Right where you go  Alright we know  You guys have talent  But you need to  Fucking just do it  Yeah  That's a great idea  Would they be rotating  Them on time shifts  Or no  Yeah you're rotating  One of you guys  When you graduate from here  You're going to get  Mornings in Portland  Right  The next guy is going to get  Afternoons in Chicago  But you know  You would kind of be  Battling against each other  But you would have  Had to care about  The fucking business 
[01:58:00]  Not just this  Fucking next rating  And that's how  They fucked radio  Yep  Because I'll tell you the truth  There is nothing  That people connect more to  Than local radio  You  No fucking show  That does a national radio show  Should be second  At the very most  In every market  Right  Because local radio  You could really  Fucking compel people  Right  But they don't love radio  They don't love it  I used to  I used to love radio  And I couldn't wait 
[01:58:30]  To get in my car  In a new market  And check it out  And I  I don't remember  How long it is now  But I just stopped  Because I knew  I wasn't going to hear  Anything  Compelling  Or creative  Or different anymore  It's garbage  But there was a time  Everywhere  When I was growing up  In this business  18  And I was driving  From Long Island  To just fucking  Either  Well  Geneseo  Then it was Rochester  Then it was Buffalo  Those are long fucking rides  And you would tune in  Those tiny little stations  And they would blow your mind  With the shit they were doing  Some guy would be in there 
[01:59:00]  Just fucking wailing man  They would be wailing away  And then  Somewhere along  I'm trying to put a date on it  I don't know  Somewhere in the mid 90's  I guess I would have to say  You started realizing  Holy fuck  It's absolutely  The same sounding show  No matter what market you're in  And that's what consultants  Did to it  By being lazy  Yeah  Yeah  By being fucking lazy  And acting like  Okay here's what time  These bits have to be replayed  Blah blah blah  There's no originality  It's too bad  And it's the same thing  That happens around here  The only thing 
[01:59:30]  That garners any interest  Is pre-established  Proven brands  If you're  If you've made a name  For yourself somewhere else  Or if you have a brand  Doing something  Well they think  Yeah they think  Then they'll put you on  They think  Cause this fucking  Celebrity  Is good in his field  That he's gonna do  A good radio show  Right  It's gonna  Smack him in the fucking ass  Or look  Everybody's going to this website  What if we  Gave this website a show  And now everybody's gonna listen  No they already go to the website  Are they listening to that show  No  I like those guys though 
[02:00:00]  But no one's listening  Why would they  Just go to the website  Whenever you want  But how do you know  They're not listening  You're talking about BuzzFeed right  BuzzFeed has it  Rotten Tomatoes has it  Rotten Tomatoes yeah  They have their own shows  Because their website was good  Yeah  BuzzFeed is a radio show  Where they at  And they still won't give you  A radio show  No hell no  But they'll give a website  No interest in that  Where's BuzzFeed at  On uh  Stars 2  Wait  No  Indie  Stars 2 is now Indie  Yeah I heard that  Changing the name  What's wrong 
[02:00:30]  Indie is the name of a channel  Well it's like Indie  You know Indie uh  Indiana Jones  Yeah  Indie  Great lot of whip sounds  Yeah  You know what the Indie channel is  That's Sam Yu  You don't like the name Indie  It's the worst  That's hip  That's hip and young Sam  Maybe in 1992  It was hip and young  I'm here to say Indie goes probably back to the 80s  I'm here to say  You know who the last people  I'm here to say  Indie replaced College Rock 
[02:01:00]  Yeah  That's when it was the same thing  The last people  R.E.M. was Indie  Yeah  They've been around a long time now  The end of Indie  Like the end of Indie being cool  Yeah  Was when Kevin Smith and Tarantino first started getting noticed  After that  I mean Indie's over  Nobody says Indie  Maybe they're going retro  That's  They're going retro?  Indie radio's cool  You think so Jay?  It's very now  It's happening  So what are the big changes at Indie radio?  They're putting Pete Dominic on in the morning 
[02:01:30]  But he does political talk  Indie talk  Indie talk  How's he doing Indie talk?  No he's talented  But why is he on a channel that's named Indie?  Why don't they keep him on one of the political channels?  And then they're just doing  You know  Cavino and Rich and Jay Thomas  Like always  Jay Thomas is Indie  You think so?  Oh yeah  I saw him on Murphy Brown  So Indie  He was on Cheers  He's Indie  Trust me  He was another morning zoo guy  Out in LA  He was going to zoo out there?  Yeah  He took it before Shannon got out there  He was on 99X in New York City 
[02:02:00]  When I was listening  How do you know that E-Roc?  He loves everything about radio  Do you still listen to regular radio breaks?  It's hard to  Because there's nothing that stands out anymore  No young guys that you're out there going  Oh my god these fuckers are hot  Nope  No  It's just tapes of established guys  Who have been out there 20-30 years  There was a time  You absolutely were worried about  You know  Other radio shows  And people coming up and stuff  I haven't worried about a radio show  In probably 10 years  I don't think there's anyone 
[02:02:30]  That's going to fucking take us out  Dude you better look out for Pete Dominick then  Pete Dominick  Because he's coming at you in an Indie way  Alright  Could happen  Yeah  New York Times wrote it up  Yep  What?  The Indie?  Yeah  Indie  The Indie switch?  Yeah  So they got some ink  Yeah  It's good to have ink  Well this  Corporate guys love when you get the ink  This show has been so dependent for so long  It's about time we had an independent alternative  You know  Why does it bother you so?  Because you weren't asked to be part of the big Indie?  Yeah  Do you feel like that should have been your shot? 
[02:03:00]  I've  I'm discouraged because I feel like they ruined  Like the whole channel is ruined  Like Indie doesn't make any sense  And you were hoping that was a channel you could go to  Yeah  They have  Kavino and Rich right?  I love those guys  They got Jason Ellis  They got guys who are young and doing  Whatever  Indie type of stuff  That's not Indie  No that's Indie  You just described Indie  They could have made a young guy's channel  And instead they made Indie  So your only problem now is Pete Dominick 
[02:03:30]  I don't mind Pete Dominick  But what are you unhappy then?  That they're not doing a young  It's not a young guy's channel  It's not young guy talk  It's called independent thought  It's described as NPR with a bite  They're doing something called  Ew  Wait they're doing independent  Fucking NPR with a bite  That's what Indie means  Okay  Independent thought  Independent thought  And the article said NPR  Isn't that what we're kind of doing?  NPR fucking stinks  The most overrated radio ever 
[02:04:00]  So sick of it  But picture it with a bite  That might be a little better  You know what?  Yeah you're missing the bite part  You're missing the bite part  Yeah the bite is what really gets it in  Sam wants another radio show  But they're not going to give you one  Because you're too big of a part of this show  So that's why  No matter what they tell you  They haven't sent you off on your own  Because you're a valuable member here  I sat down with those guys  I gave my blessing  Like look I'd hate to lose Sam  But if it means a better fucking career path 
[02:04:30]  You gotta do it  You have to  He's literally told multiple people in management  If you have an opportunity for Sam  I will not be mad at you for taking it  What's their reasoning?  I just  I mean  You know  I'm trying  They're just stupid  They don't know what they're doing  Here's a kid that works his fucking balls off  He's been on a million fucking radio shows  He's done everything they've asked of him  He now runs the 10 o'clock hour for our channel  And they fucking are just stupid 
[02:05:00]  They don't get it  But even though you'll let them go  They are looking at the bigger picture  What they see the bigger picture is this show  Well then give them the money  And they see you as being a valuable part of this show  And of the staff  And they don't want to lose  They give them the money at least  What?  Mike Tyson's coming out  In here?  Yeah  Oh good  What are you talking about?  Roland just whispered in my ear  Mike Tyson's coming in here right now  How did this happen?  Get the camera  It wasn't the wizard  Do we have time for break or we should stay?  Okay I'm going to ask you 
[02:05:30]  Oh really?  I was packed  No no  Have you met Mike before?  Yeah  A few times  He was on our show  It was probably one of the best hours ever  He was out of his mind  What is he promoting?  I'm getting nervous  Don't get nervous  He's a fun interviewer  He's a very good talker  So Mike you still boxing or what?  Just dumb questions  How about Roland tell us what he's promoting?  What is he promoting?  Does anyone know?  He's doing Sway  Nobody's doing  Yeah but he's got to be pushing  Is it his one man show?  No  What is he promoting D-Rock? 
[02:06:00]  I don't think anything  No no he's promoting something  Someone promotes  His one man show is done  I thought he was taking that on the road  What is he promoting?  Doesn't he have something going on Sam?  I have no idea  That's great  I knew he was in the building from 9 to 12  I'm like wow  Oh you did know?  Oh yeah  He's doing Sway  He's doing a  Oh fuck Roland 
[02:06:30]  You put us in a spot  Now we're just sitting here waiting  How do you turn those off?  Roland goes  Mike Tyson's coming in  And then he just leaves  Yeah I do the same thing with those TVs  Because people will just fucking look at them  They're too distracting  All the ADD people  What's Mike Tyson promoting?  Kenny?  I think Spencer's doing the show a favor  And squeezed him in  And I heard him say to Roland  He'll feed the plugs once he's in here  Okay  Alright 
[02:07:00]  So we're getting a little squeeze  Squeeze job today?  A little squeeze job  Thanks Kenny  Alright a few minutes with Mike Tyson  Never hurt anyone  Well that's not true  Evander Holyfield  I saw an interesting  Why is he running?

I don't know  I'm just going to be there  I'm going to be in their presence I'm sure  Hey your show going on the road  I saw  I was somewhere  And I saw like this  Coming in March  It might have been San Diego or somewhere  Yes  I'm going to do more than a  Probably a 40 or 30  30 city tour  And we're going to start off in Indianapolis  Whoa whoa whoa  And then go from there  I think our last show was in D.C.  Or Maryland  Nice  Yeah  Have you been updating the show and adding to it 
[02:08:30]  Or is it kind of the same as it was when you were  Well I don't know  I believe my publicist said we added a few shows  And it's selling pretty well  I'm just very grateful  You know  And you know  Yeah I'm very grateful  Yeah  The show was  I told you I saw it  The show was  The one man show was amazing  It was brutally honest  And that was what was so entertaining about it  I can give you the tour start date right now  Yeah  It's when Mike points at a fucking little stick  You read  You read  It's February the 13th 
[02:09:00]  You can go to Facebook  It's Mike Tyson  On tour for a list of cities and tickets  And also  March the 19th  If you're here on the East Coast  In Newark Prudential Hall  And April the 28th  Yeah  In the Newark Prudential Hall  The beacon in New York City  Oh wow  Is the 28th  And the 5th  Is the  I don't know what this says  West  Is that Westbury Theater  Big time  Oh Westbury Music Hall  Okay over in Long Island  So you're kind of hitting every borough  Right  And is the show  I'm sorry  Is the show the exact same  Or has it been changed at all 
[02:09:30]  It's pretty much the same  I discussed with my wife  Who's the writer  And that we should change  Some other experiences in life  So maybe we'll either  Add some in  Or else we're  We'll do it for the next tour  Called something else  This is with Spike  Second Chance tour  Or something  Yeah  But is Spike Lee still involved  Yeah  He's producing still  Direct now  And he directed  You put the whole thing together  You know  With Mike's acting  The  That movie that you did 
[02:10:00]  James Toback's movie  Black and White  Oh god yeah  Was so  Strong  And I mean  Going scene for scene  With Robert Downey Jr.  To me  Was one of  I mean  Because that guy  Is so great  But the scene  He's amazing  Yeah  The scene that you guys  Did together  Had so much electricity  I thought it was  Just phenomenal  I'm just so happy  To be able  To have that opportunity  To work with  The kind of  Elite class  At such an early stage  In my career  And improvisation 
[02:10:30]  Right  It was  It's unbelievable  To pull off  But they told me  To smack the shit  Out of Robert  Yeah  They just smacked  Oh you can say  Oh you can curse  It's fine  Well no I can't  Because my wife  Said I can't  Can't  Can't  Can't  Can't  Can't  Can't  Can't  Can't  Can't  Somebody  Come back  And get  Us  Hey  You said  Shit  On  So  You can't  Have that  Position  That job  Oh you don't  Want stuff  To get out  There  Like  Yeah  Now you're  A bad guy  Again  You saying  Things  I can't  Talk about  People now  With your 
[02:11:00]  Guys  It's gonna  Be a dead  Shitty show  Well the  Great thing  About that  Is the  Look of  Terror  When you  Grab  Robert Downey  Jr.  The look  Of terror  On his  Face  Because that's  The thing  About improvisation  You don't  Know how  Far it's  Going to  Go  And he  Was in  The moment  Too  It was  He looked  Like he  Was going  To die  But still  He was  Down in the  Bottom  Kicking me  Get off  Me  Get off  Me  They didn't  See  Show that  Part  But he  Was fighting 
[02:11:30]  He was kicking  Are you happy  With where  Things are now  Like you got  Things are so  Much calmer  Now it seems  Than like  In the past  I'm just  I don't know  What I am  I'm just happy  To be existing  Being alive  And having  The opportunity  To give  To have  A better  Image to  My children  Than I had  Before I  Started going  On this  Particular  Journey  It's been  A good  Journey  You're on  A roll  Sir  I'm very  Grateful  What was  The turning  Point Mike 
[02:12:00]  What was  That turning  Point that  Made you  Think  I'm going  To go  Right  Instead of  Left  I just  Needed a  Change  I was  Just killing  Myself  I just  Needed a  Change  It all  Comes to  Time  In all  Of our  Life  Even if  Everything  Is going  Well  Super  Something  Has to  Change  And I  Felt this  Was the  Opportunity  For me  To change  Were you  Afraid  At one  Point  Like when  Things  Are crazy  And bad  That sometimes  Not knowing  What it's 
[02:12:30]  Going to  Be like  After  Is even  Scarier  Than  Things  Remaining  Bad  Were you  Afraid  Of what  Life  Would be  Like  Without  All  That  Turmoil  At  One  Point  I'm  Living  Life  Without  It  Now  And  It's  Pretty  Progress  I've  Come  Such  A  Long  Way  To  Try  To  Backslide  But  It's  Been  Known  To  Happen  Before  So  It's  A  Conscious  Consistent  Inside  Job  You know  It's  Consistent  And  Consistent  Did you  Always  Have  This  Because  The  Thing  I  Liked  About  The  Show 
[02:13:00]  So  Much  Was  There  Was  A  Lot  I  Guess  It  Was  Brutally  Honest  It  Was  There  Was  No  There  Was  Nothing  Fake  About  It  You  Felt  Like  You  Were  In  Your  Living  Room  And  This  Is  How  You  Talk  To  People  About  What  Happened  In  Your  Life  And  Did  You  Always  Have  That  Kind  Of  Insight  Into  Yourself  Or  Was  That  Something  That  You  Gained  After  Things  Slowed  Down  For  You  A  Little  Bit  Of  Of  Course  I  Always  Had  Some  Sort  Of  Insight  In  That  But  I  Just  Didn't  Have  A  Time  To  Express  It  Because  Of  The  Rat  Race  I  Was  In  You  Know  I  Was  King  Rat  And  In  That 
[02:13:30]  Situation  You  Never  Have  No  Time  To  Do  Any  Inside  Searching  You  Know  Just  Trying  To  Survive  Right  So  Once  It's  Quiet  You  Can  Look  Back  Then  You  Have  Some  Time  To  Reflect  And  Make  Decisions  On  What  Really  Happened  I  Don't  Really  Think  About  What  Really  Happened  I  Always  Think  About  What  Happen  Is  There  Anything  That  You  Really  Would  Like  To  Happen  That  You  Kind  Of  Think  Is  Kind  Of

[02:21:30]  Declarative  Statement  You  Can  Contrary  To  Popular  Delief  You  Can  But  To  Watch  These  Guys  The  Chess  Match  That's  Actually  Going  On  There's  So  Much  More  Thought  Involved  Than  I  Think  People  Realize  Who  Don't  Watch  It  It's  An  Invincible  Energy  That  You  Can't  Even  Fathom  I  Watch  Hughes  Matt  Hughes  Fight  Holy  I 
[02:22:00]  Watched  Him  Bend  His  Arm  So  Far  Back  He  Bend  Gracie's  Arm  So  Far  Back  He  Couldn't  Go  Back  Any  Further  And  He  Didn't  Tap  Out  So  He  Let  The  Hand  Go  And  Look  For  Another  Another  Another  Hold  He  Didn't  Be  And  Tapped  Out  He  Had  To  Beat  Him  To  Submission  He  Had  To  Beat  Him  Unconscious  And  And  And  This  Sounds  Horrible  And  It's  Disgusting  But  Right  There  That's  The  Essence  Of  Fighting  Right  There  The  Most  Worst  Part  Is  Willing  To  Give  Your  Life  For  That  Art  Right  Not  That  You're  Getting  Beat  Up  That  It 
[02:22:30]  Means  That  Much  To  You  That  I  Won't  Give  Into  The  Essence  Of  Losing  Our  Essence  Of  Losing  And  Fighting  Even  Though  We  Die  We  Won  Right  That's  The  That's  The  Mentality  To  The  Top  Apex  Of  Fighting  Mentality  Wow  Do  You  Think  That  Two  It's  Like  Cause  You  Know  MMA  Gets  A  Bad  Rap  Because  There's  Elbows  Thrown  And  There's  Knees  But  I  Think  Boxing  Is  Really  Was  Was  Scarier  They  Get  Hurt  More  In  Boxing  The  MMA  There's  No  They  Do  Because  The  Jab  Right  Ten  Rounds  Of  Jab  You're  Getting  Listen  If

[02:23:30]  Is  Different  Now  We  Have  So  Much  To  Do  Come  On  Don't  Kill  Yourself  Let's  Do  This  Or  That  Back  Then  This  Is  All  We  Had  We  Had  This  Cold  We  Die  In  The  Ring  Or  We  Take  Our  Beating  Like  Men  And  So  It's  Good  To  Say  Hey  I  Don't  Want  To  Do  This  No  More  God  For  If  Somebody  Hear  That  I  Give  Up  I  Don't  Want  To  Go  Out  You  Just 
[02:24:00]  Didn't  Do  That  You  Didn't  Do  That  Back  Then  You  Know  It's  So  Cool  It's  Cool  To  Do  Now  It's  Not  A  Big  Thing  To  Do  Now  Back  Then  You  Didn't  Do  That  Nobody  Would  Have  Anything  To  Do  With  You  It's  Just  Like  A  Dog  In  A  Fight  That  Quit  Right  Kill  You  Wow  Is  Anything  More  Heartbreaking  Than  The  Thriller  In  Manila  DVD  With  Ali  And  Frazier  Where  They  Say  That  Ali  Was  Wanted  The  Gloves  Cut  Off  Yeah  And  The  Guy  Said  You  Can't  Even  Write  That  In  The  Storybook 
[02:24:30]  Like  Frazier  Should  Have  Won  That  Fight  Right  And  Just  Kind  Of  Gave  Up  A  Second  Before  Ali  Did  He  Didn't  Give  Up  I  Said  You  Can't  Fight  Frazier  He  Said  We  Can't  See  Joe  You  Can't  See  Joe  Said  Tell  Me  Where  That  I  Find  Him  Wow  Yeah  That's  A  Mentality  Guys  Who  Aren't  In  That  Game  Just  Can't  Oh  Losing  Is  Actually  Dying  Yeah  I  Don't  Think  Joe 
[02:25:00]  Got  The  Respect  That  He  Deserved  From  People  Either  I  Mean  He  Was  Such  A  Phenomenal  Fighter  But  He  Fought  The  Same  Time  As  Ali  No  He  Had  To  Because  Holly  Couldn't  Be  Ali  Without  Frazier  Yeah  That's  True  No  Way  I  Couldn't  Be  Ali  Without  Frazier  Frazier  Brought  Out  The  Best  Of  Him  You  Know  He  Could  Never  Find  That  In  Himself  If  He  Never  Fought  Frazier  He  Would  Never  Beat  Ali  That  We  Look  At  Him  Today  Do  You  Think  Larry  Holmes  Was  An  Underrated  Champion  Yes 
[02:25:30]  Incredible  Fighter  Yes  Amazing  Fighter  It  Just  Seemed  That  People  Didn't  Like  Him  As  Much  As  Ali  And  He  Went  To  49  Oh  He  Bad  Right  Unmercifully  And  You  Know  We  Not  Gonna  Like  That  Stuff  But  Didn't  He  I  Thought  He  Like  He  Cried  After  That  Fight  Holmes  He  Tried  To  Take  It  Easy  On  The  He  Never  Tried  To  Take  He  Really  Did  It  And  One  Time  I  Was  Only  14  At  The  Time  1980

[02:29:00]  A  Blow  Dart  Gun  And  All  All  Sorts  Of  Shit  Because  He  Was  Basically  Saying  His  Daughter  Is  Seeing  A  Guy  That  Might  Be  A  Little  Jungle  Like  He  Was  Saying  This  Shit  And  Then  He  Was  Doing  A  Blow  Dart  Gun  Thing  I  Didn't  Know  His  Wife  Was  Here  Because  I  Face  She  Was  Behind  Me  And  He  Kept  Referencing  Her  And  She  Is  Stunning  Like  What  A  Knock  You'd  Expect  Him  To  Have  A  Hot  Wife  But  Wow  But  She's  Also  Very  Together  She's  Like  She's  Working 
[02:29:30]  On  The  Mike  Tyson  Brand  It  Looks  Like  Yeah  But  She's  Coming  At  From  A  Better  Place  Than  Us  You  Know  We  Just  See  Him  Go  Crazy  She  Wants  To  See  Him  Be  It  Looked  Okay  It  Like  Looking  At  An  Ugly  Celebrity  You  Don't  See  Them  As  Ugly  Anymore  Because  They're  So  Famous  It's  The  Tattoo 
[02:30:00]  That  Tattoo  Is  So  Famous  If  You  Forget  That  It's  On  Half  His  Face  He  Also  Though  When  Mike  Came  In  The  First  Time  Who  Kid  Said  You  Never  Know  What  Mike  You're  Going  To  Get  Not  A  Bad  Way  He's  Like  Some  Days  He's  Very  High  Energy  Other  Days  He's  Melt  Like  That  First  Time  He  Came  In  He  Could  Have  Just  Been  Having  A  Mellow  Day  This  Was  Just  A  Mellow  Day  I 
[02:30:30]  And  I  Know  That  Was  The  Real  Answer  Just  Sits  On  The  But  I  Would  Like  To  Think  Mike  Tyson  Is  Out  There  Doing  Something  Else  Besides  Just  Watching  TV  And  They  Broke  Him  You  Think  Yeah  They  Broke  Him  Well  Prison  Will  Do  That  To  You  Taking  Away  All  The  Money  And  Oh  It's  Good  I  Don't  Have  All  The  Money

[02:34:00]  We  Know  Because  He  Been  On  The  Show  Twice  And  He  Likes  To  Just  Avoid  That  I  Don't  With  That  He  Doesn't  Even  Like  Really  Talking  He'll  Talk  About  Boxing  In  General  He  Still  Loves  The  Sport  Of  Boxing  But  He  Doesn't  Like  Talking  About  His  Time  In  It  Anymore  At  All  He's  Had  It  Maybe  He's  Just  Sick  Of  The  Same  Questions  Over  And  I  Don't  Know  The  First 
[02:34:30]  Booth  That  I  Was  In  The  Evil  Angel  Booth  He  Was  Just  Being  Brought  Around  And  The  Way  You  Just  It  Is  That  Sea  There  Was  A  Movement  Right  It 
[02:35:00]  Is  Gone  And  It's  Like  You're  Saying  It's  Like  You've  Walked  Into  A  Cartoon  Like  You're  A  Little  Kid  And  You've  Walked  Into  A  Cartoon  That's  How  People  Are  Larger  Than  Life  Guy  Yeah  Are  You  Surprised  He's  Still  Alive  He  Should  Be  Dead  I  Mean  He  Did  Enough  To  Be 
[02:35:30]  Not  Many  Especially  After  He  Lost  The  Money  Right  I  Mean  Like  He  Lost  Hundreds  And  Hundreds  Of  Millions  Of  Dollars  That  No  One  Knows  Where  That  Was  Basically  Robbed  From  Yeah  I  Hear  He  Basically  Lived  In  A  School  In  Connecticut  That's  How  Big  His  House  Was  It  Was  Like  They  Describe  It  As  A  School  Well  You  Know  Like  The  Amount  Of  Fucking  Money  This  Guy  Yeah  How  Did  You  Lose  It  Again  White  Tigers  Oh

[02:36:30]  Us  Out  To  Vegas  Food  Would  Be  Sent  To  Us  And  We  Would  Be  Drinking  And  Drugs  And  Stuff  And  You  Would  Be  On  The  Air  Going  This  Is  The  Most  Don  King  Has  Done  It  Again  This  Is  One  Of  The  Most  Remarkable  Things  I've  Ever  He  He  You  Just  Fuck  For  Him  You  You  We  Didn't  Have  That  Experience  We  Had  Him  On  Once  Maybe  Twice  Jimmy  Oh  He  Has  Been  On  A  Couple  Times  And  You  Go  Into  Going  He  Is  The  Worst  Human  Being  Alive  But  He  Turns  You  He  Turns  You  Right  In  Front  Of  Your  Face  How  Do  They  Describe 
[02:37:00]  Him  In  When  We  Were  Kings  They  Said  He  Has  This  Amazing  Air  Of  Welcome  And  He  Has  This  Way  Of  Making  You  We  Like  Having  Around  Like  Not  Not  A  Laugh  Box  Guy  But  A  Guy  Who  Genuinely  Enjoys  You  You  Like  Having  Around  Because  They  Make  You  Feel  Good  And  That's  The  Effect  He  Has  On  People  And  He  Makes  You  Feel  Fucking  Valid 
[02:37:30]  He  Makes  You  Feel  Alive  He  Makes  You  Feel  Smart  Makes  You  Feel  Part  Of  And  The  Weird  Thing  About  That  Is  You  Would  Just  Suddenly  The  Fact  That  It  Would  Just  Be  In  Vegas  So  Everybody  Had  To  Fly  In  You  Know  What  I mean  Like  The  Audience  Doesn't  Drive  There  The  Audience  Flies  In  The  Audience  Is  Staying  In  The  Same  Hotel  You're  Surrounded  By  It  And  It  Just  Building  All  Week  And  Then  Finally  I  Don't  Think  The  Superbowl  Can  Ever  Compare  To  The  Kind  Of  Weirdness  That  A  Big  Fight  Has  And  Certainly  The  The 
[02:38:00]  New  MMA  Stuff  Doesn't  Compare  Yet  Right  Because  All  The  Money  Isn't  Being  Bet  Like  Everybody  Bet  Right  When  Ali  And  Frazier  Fought  The  Entire  Country  Had  Some  Kind  Of  Bet  Going  Back  My  First  Loss  As a  Wager  The  First  Wager  I  Ever  Made  Was  A  Dollar  Fifty  To  My  Friend  Kenny  Panko  In  Sixth  Grade  And  It  Was  The  Ali  Holmes  Fight  And  I  Bet  A  Dollar  Fifty  On  Muhammad  Ali  In  Quarters  And  I  Lost  It  I  Didn't  Understand  That  He  Was  Going  To  Ship  It  On  The 
[02:38:30]  Holmes  Thing  Came  Up  In  The  Interview  And  The  Reason  Why  Like  Everyone  Wanted  The  Next  Ali  And  That  Was  A lot  Of  Pressure  For  Holmes  Because  He  Didn't  Have  That  Charisma  Or  That  Personality  But  He  Was  An  Amazing  Boxer  A  Jabber  But  He  Didn't  Have  The  Mike  Skills  Or  Any  Of  That  Shit  And  That  That's  Why  He  Probably  Doesn't  Get  The  Respect  That  He  Probably  Deserves  Because  We're  Not  You  Know  Why  Does  Joe  Namath  Get  Remembered  More  Than  Any  Other  Quarterback  And  He  Only  Had  The  One  Super  Bowl  Because  There  Was  Something  About  Joe  He 
[02:39:00]  Had  Charisma  Ali  If  You  Go  Back  And  Look  At  Some  Of  The  Things  That  Ali  Said  He  Said  Some  Of  The  Worst  Fucking  Things  In  The  World  And  People  Would  Be  Like  Laughing  And  Then  Fucking  Poor  Joe  Would  Say  Something  Back  And  Everybody  Like  Joe  You  Fucking  You're  A  Scumbag  You're  Fucking  Piece  Of  Trash  You're  Garbage  Fucking  Ali  Came  Into  Philadelphia  Fucking  Joe  Frazier's  Town  Fucked  With  Him  On  His  Block  And  The  People  Philadelphia  Sided  With  Fucking  Ali 
[02:39:30]  In  His  Home  Town  It  Killed  Frazier  And  Frazier  Lent  Him  Money  Yeah  Gave  Him  Money  That  Whole  Story  Where  Ali  Was  Down  On  His  Luck  And  Frazier  Was  One  That  Came  To  His  Aid  And  Helped  Him  Out  A  Little  Bit  Gave  Him  A  few  Bucks  Got  Him  Back  In  And  And  You  know  He  Was  Like  Back  In  The  Civil  Rights  Days  He  Was  Called  Like  Uncle  Tom  And  Shit  Like  The  Worst  Thing  That  You  About  A  Black  Person  In  Philly  Holy  Fuck  People  Still  Sigh  I  Mean  I  Always  Feel  Bad  For  Francher  Although 
[02:40:00]  Ali  Had  A  Knack  For  Really  Fucking  With  Tough  Black  Like  You  Know  He  Went  To  Sonny  Liston  House  And  Just  Nobody  Sonny  Liston  Was  A  Dock  Worker  From  Philly  Like  You  He  Was  The  Guy  Who  Would  Literally  Break  Your  Fucking  Head  Up  With  A  Stick  He  Was  A  Genuine  Tough  Guy  And  Ali  Would  Show  Up  At  His  House  And  Taunt  Them  He  Just  He  Knew  How  To  Promote  A  Fight  How  Did  He  Do  That  I  Mean  He  Was  The  First  Shock  Jock  He  Thought  Of  Anybody  He  Did  That  Shit  Up  I  I'm  Only 
[02:40:30]  Gonna  Fuck  With  The  People  That  Are  Above  Where  I  Am  And  Make  People  Say  To  Them  You  You  Gotta  Do  This  Right  You  Why  Why  Are  You  Asking  About  Him  You  Know  It  Was  A  Great  I  Wanted  To  Ask  Tyson  About  This  But  I  Didn't  Because  I'm  Wearing  An  Ali  Sweatshirt  So  I  Didn't  Ask  Him  But  I  Wanted  To  Ask  Him  About  His  First  Time  Meeting  Ali  But  I  Think  It  Be  Too  Cheesy  Wearing  Ali  Because  I  Watched 
[02:41:00]  Recently  The  Interview  Of  Ali  On  Arsenio  When  Sugar  Ray  And  Tyson  Came  Out  And  I  Can't  I  Think  That  Was  The  First  Time  Anybody  Had  Seen  Mike  Tyson  Be  Really  Humble  In  Front  Of  Somebody  People  Only  Knew  Him  As  This  Crazy  Champion  But  To  See  Him  Pay  Such  Homage  To  Ali  On  TV  Was  I  Think  Surprised  Everybody  Well  Did  You  Ever  See  Him  With  Cuz  D'amato  With  Tyson  When  He  Was  A  Kid  He  Treated  Cuz  Cuz  Like 
[02:41:30]  Cuz  Was  Basically  Like  Do  This  And  Tyson  Would  Do  It  And  Then  When  Cuz  Died  That's  When  It  Got  Really  Fuck  And  He  Left  Kevin  Rooney  Don  King  The  One  Thing  I  Want  To  Mention  About  Don  King  We've  Had  A lot  Of  Fighters  In  Here  Over  The  Years  None  Of  Them  Really  Kill  Don  King  They'll  Talk  Bad  About  Him  A  Little  bit  But  They  Don  Motherfuck  Him  I  Tyson  Motherfuck  Is  Special  Yeah  Yeah  But  We  Haven't  Had  A  Guy  That  Motherfuck  Don  King  If  You  Want  More  Money  You  Gotta  Go  Back  Yeah  But  These  Are  Guys  That  Are  Way  Past 
[02:42:00]  Their  Fighting  Days  We've  Asked  A lot  Of  The  Fighters  About  Them  They  Probably  Just  Don't  You  Don't  Acknowledge  They  Don't  Want  To  Deal  With  It  You  Don't  Want  To  Think  About  That  Money  You  Lost  And  We  Talked  Before  Too  I  Think  That  Was  One  Of  The  Things  About  Don  King  That's  Fascinating  To  All  Of  Us  Is  That  He  Alpha  Mailed  Ali  And

[02:51:00]  British  Theater  Yeah  For  Me  I  There's  A  Ian  Home  Who  Was  We  Know  From  Films  Because  He  Was  The  Alien  And  The  Alien  And  Stuff  Like  That  He  Was  The  Guy  With  The  White  Blood  That  She  Suddenly  Meets  In  The  Alien  I  Remember  That  I  Haven't  Seen  He's  A  Great  Actor  But  He  Stayed  Off  Stage  For  A  Long  Time  He  Sort  Of  Got  Stage  Fright  So  He  Was  Off  For  About  20  Years  And  They  Came  Back  In  A  Pinter  Play  And  I  Went  To  See  That  And  He's  He's  My  Favorite  Actor  I  Just  Think  He's  Wonderful  So  You  Should  Check  him  Out 
[02:51:30]  How  Did  You  Get  You  Play  For  Those  You  Who  Are  Walking  Dead  Fans  If  You  Haven't  Seen  The  First  Half  Of  Season  Three  Turn  There's  Some  Spoilers  But  You  Play  The  Governor  Of  This  Village  That  They  Stumble  On  With  People  And  You  Really  Are  You  Turn  Out  To  Be  Kind  Of  A  Sociopathic  Character  He  Creates  This  Protective  Place  Where  Your  Kids  Can  Run  Out  Of  Their  House  And  They  Can  Be  Safe  Now  In  This  World  That  Is  Very  Rare  But 
[02:52:00]  Of  Course  That  Type  Of  Security  Comes  At  A  Price  And  He  Slightly  Manipulates  His  Populacy  Somebody  Who  Says  Your  Security  Is  Dependent  On  Me  So  You  Have  To  Worship  Me  In  Some  Sort  Of  Way  So  That's  What  He's  Doing  But  He  Then  Lets  Two  People  Into  His  Community  Which  Is  Michonne  And  Andrea  Who  We  Know  Very  Well  From  The  Last  Series  And  That  Sort  Of  Starts  To  Undermine  His  Power  Really  And  Andrea  Tells  Merle  Who  Is  His  Main  Henchman  And  His  Brother  Is  Close  By  So  That  All 
[02:52:30]  Starts  To  Unravel  His  Leadership  Michael  Rucker  By  The  Michael  Rucker  Just  Wonderful  And  You  Know  And  Also  We  Know  That  Power  Is  A  Terrible  Corrupter  And  It  Sort  Of  Plays  On  The  Governor  As  Well  He  Starts  To  Find  That  You  Know  Once  Power  Is  Slipping  Through  His  Fingers  He  Is  Going  To  Fight  Like  A  Dog  To  Keep  It  And  He  Also  Has  This  Thing  With  Quite  A  Strange  Thing  And  Where  He  Has  His  Daughter  And  His  Daughter  Is  Is  A  Walker  But  He's  Holding  On  To  This  Hope  That  She  Will  Sort  Of  Come  Back  To  Him  And 
[02:53:00]  Then  Once  That's  Taken  Away  From  Cubby  You  Have  Her  In  And  She  The  Nursery  As I  Like  To  Call  The  Nursery  Yes  And  You're  Talking  To  Her  And  You're  Screaming  Look  At  Me  Look  At  Me  And  She  Just  Won't  Look  At  You  And  There  Was  Such  A  Great  Hopelessness 
[02:53:30]  In  That  Like  That  Is  The  Reality  And  I  Like  The  Fact  That  The  Walking  Dead  Doesn't  Give  You  The  Happy  Moment  You  Kind  Of  Hoping  Anybody  Who's  A  Father  You  Know  You  Maybe  Your  Kids  Are  Ill  Or  Something  You  Know  You  Sort  Of  Feel  This  Powerlessness  And  This  Is  A  Man  Who's  There  He  Is  With  His  Daughter  All  His  Best  Memories  All  His  Best  Self  Is  Wrapped  Up  In  This  Relationship  You  Know  I  Think  Him  Being  A  Father  Was  The  Making  Of  This  Man  So 
[02:54:00]  When  That  Is  Taken  Away  From  Him  His  World  Really  Does  Crumble  And  I  Think  Then  When  That  Happens  To  Him  He  Gets  Angry  At  The  World  The  World  Has  Treated  Him  So  Badly  So  It's  It's  A  Warped  Sense  Of  Revenge  On  His  Part  But  It's  Also  Something  That  I  Understand  You  Can  Get  Angry  At  The  World  When  It  Doesn't  Treat  You  Well  And  Seize  Did  You 
[02:54:30]  Have  To  Audition  For  Did  They  Offer  Did  You  Hear  About  It  And  Say  I  Really  Want  To  Be  In  This  Well  A  Mixer  Of  All  Of  Those  Things  Really  I  I  I  I  Came  To  The  Show  As  A  Fan  I  I  Stuck  With  It  And  Loved 
[02:55:00]  It  And  Then  I  Went  To  L.A.  Last  Year  And  Whilst  I  Was  There  My  Manager  Said  Listen  There's  A  Park  Coming  Up  On  The  Walking  Dead  Do  You  Want  To  Go  Up  For  It  And  I  Yeah  Tell  Me  Where  I  Need  To  And  When  And  I  Met  The  Creatives  There  And  Got  Well  With  Them  And  It  Happened  Very  Quickly  From  Then  On  And  The  Part  Wasn't  Really  Defined  And  They  Were  Saying  It's  A  Major  Part  But  They  Weren't  Saying  What  It  Was  And  I  Didn't  Know  The  Comics  I  Don't  Know  The  Comics  At  All  And  Then  I  Went  To  The  Comics  After 
[02:55:30]  I  Got  The  Part  And  It's  A  Very  Different  Sort  Of  Character  In  The  Comics  He's  Very  Evil  Right  Off  The  So  I  Wanted  To  And  You  Ended  Up  Researching  Cults  Right  Yeah  Well  Cults  And  Leadership  All  Over  Really  Not  Just  You  Know  I  Mean  There's  An  Idea  That  You  Know  What  The  Woodbury  Is  Which  Is  My  Community  It  Has  A  Cultish  Like  Atmosphere  To  It  But  Also  It  Has  A  Normal  Leadership  Quality  To  It  You  Know  That  Idea  That  You  Know  The  More  That  You  Can  Paint  This  Danger  On  The  Outside 
[02:56:00]  Really  I  Mean  You  Know  There's  You  Know  From  All  Of  Our  Leaders  Look  Have  To  Play  With  That  But  You  Know  Cultish  Wise  I  Mean  Waco  Is  The  Big  One  And  Jim  Jones  And  Stuff  Like  That  But  I  Mean  Also  I  Look  At  Communities  In  Danger  So  You  Look  At  The  Plague  In  Europe  In  The  1300  You  Know  People  Were  Building  Walls  Around  Their  Villages  And  Not  Letting 
[02:56:30]  People  In  And  Not  Letting  People  Out  And  People  Were  Dying  Left  Right  And  Center  Their  Leaders  Were  Dying  So  People  Who  Weren't  Equipped  To  Be  Their  Leaders  Were  Suddenly  Having  To 
[02:57:00]  So  You  Read  Up  On  These  Guys  These  Cult  Leaders  The  Koresh  Or  Marshall  White  Apple  Or  Apple  White  Whatever  It  Was  I  Always  Get  That  Mixed  Up  You  Know  Nike's  Castration  That's  All  You  Need  So  How  Does  It  Help  You  As  An  Actor  When  You  Read  This  Stuff  About  These  Guys  It  Starts  To  Immerse  You  In  The  World  You  Know  So  If  You  Read  About  Manson  For  Instance  You  Know  The  Way  He  Had  A  Hold  Over  His  Followers  Those  Type  Of  Things  And  What  That  The  Way  That  People  Can  Manipulate  People  Around  Them  And  Also  Where  They  Come  From  You 
[02:57:30]  Know  I  Mean  There's  There's  A  Whole  Nature  Nurture  Sort  Of  Are  You  Born  Like  This  Or  Is  The  World  Created  You  Of  Of  Both  Those  Things  Are  True  So  It's  Just  Immersing  Yourself  In  The  World  Really  And  I  Like  To  Do  That  Not  All  Actors  Do  That  Some  Actors  Are  Reading  The  Morning  News  And  They  Just  Walk  On  And  They're  Brilliant  And  Great  That's  Their  Method  Mine  I like  To  Immerse  Myself  In  Things  Around  The  Subject  I'm  Working  On  It's  My  Inner  Geek  Comes  Out  In  That  Way  Will  You  Be  Like  That  Off  Camera  Too  Like  I  Heard  Louis  CK  Talked  To  On  The 
[02:58:00]  Phone  He  Said  He  Was  Still  Talking  Like  Ulysses  S  Grant  On  The  Phone  Because  He  Was  In  Between  Takes  Will  You  Do  That  Yeah  I  Stay  In  Accent  Certainly  Oh  You  Do  All  The  Time  Me  And  Andrew  And  Also  The  Great  Thing  We  Have  Is  We  Film  In  Atlanta  So  You  Know  Our  Whole  Crew  Is  Local  So  We  We're  Hearing  As  Well  So  We  Just  Talk  To  Them  In  Accent  All  The  Time  And  That's  Really  Good  For  Us  Because  It's  Like  Any  Workout  When  You  Do  A  New  Accent  Your  Muscles  Are  Different  You're  Asking  Different  Things  Of  Your  Muscles  To  Get  Going  So  You  Need  To  Keep  Them  Up  There  Which  Of  The  Leaders  Are  The 
[02:58:30]  Crazy  People  You  Read  About  Did  You  There  Had  To  Be  One  You  Connected  With  More  Than  Others  I  Don't  Relate  To  The  Drinking  Poison  But  There's  Something  About  This  Guy  I  Kind  Of  Understand  Yeah  I  Mean  You  Take  Little  Bits  From  All  Of  Them  I 
[02:59:00]  Now  We  All  Buy  Into  That  We  All  Buy  Into  That  Threat  That  It's  Out  There  That  They're  Coming  For  Us  And  How  That  As  A  Populist  You  You  You  You  Move  Through  Fear  Fear  Fear  Of  The  Unknown  And  That  Is  Being  Created  By  You  Know  It's  It's  A  Sort  Of  Smoke  And  Mirrors  Like  Things  Sometimes  That  Is  Making  You  Angry  As  A  Populist  And  Making  You  Sort  Of  You  Know  Manipulated  As  Well  So  He  Was  Someone  I  Looked  Out  Only  Because  Of  The  Fact  That  I  Lived  Through  It  Really  When 
[02:59:30]  You  You  You  Are  On  A  Show  Like  This  Where  You  Know  Obviously  Any  Week  They  Could  Just  You  Know  Decide  To  Kill  You  Like  Is  Every  Script  You  Get  Like  Just  A  Nightmare  Yeah  Like  You  Worried  About  Here  We  Go  It  Really  Does  Add  To  The  Feast  On  The  Set  Really  And  Also  That  You  Know  You  Get  The  Set  We  Do  An  Eight  Day  Turn  Around  You  Get  The  Script  Everyone  Runs  Off  Into  Their  Trailer  Reads  It  And  Then  They  Come  Out  You  Know  And  There  Always  One  Door  Left  Closed  But  I  Think 
[03:00:00]  That  What  Plays  On  The  Audience  As  Well  Is  That  No  One  Safe  So  They  Love  The  Characters  They  Love  Watching  The  Show  And  Getting  Into  The  Characters  But  They  Know  Like  In  The  World  Itself  It's  Not  Like  The  Star  Trek  Moment  With  The  Guy  You  You've  Never  Seen  Before  Beams  Down  And  You  Know  He's  Going  To 
[03:00:30]  Nice  Thing  It's  Not  You're  Not  Wanting  It  To  Happen  Because  It's  A  Great  Atmosphere  And  I  Love  Working  On  The  Show  But  You  Know  That  That's  Why  The  Show  Works  And  I  Think  We  Accept  It  One  Thing  That  Convinced  Me  That  This  Was  A  Really  Good  Show  Is  When  A  Show  Kill  Somebody  Off  At  The  End  Of  Season  Two  Like  The  Sopranos  Did  It  The  Walking  Dead  I  Could  Not  Believe  They  Killed  Off  The  Co-Lead  At  The  End  Of 
[03:01:00]  Season  Two  It  Shows  Like  True  Blood  Which  I've  Tried  To  Like  I  Know  It's  Kind  Of  Tweenish  Of  To  Watch  It  But  I  Can't  Get  Into  It  Because  They  Didn't  Kill  Off  A  Major  Character  They  Don't  Make  You  Feel  Like  I  Have  An  Interest  In  Watching  This  Anyway  Because  They  Will  Do  That  Then  You're  Undermining  The  Real  Danger  In  The  Show  Why  You're  Watching  It  It's  A  Different  Show  In  That  Way  Ours  Is  A  Show  That  Really  No  One  Is  Safe  And  I  Think  The  World  That  Is  True  Of  The 
[03:01:30]  World  And  It's  True  Of  The  Show  So  You  Know  That  The  Show  Is  Taking  The  World  Seriously  Then  The  People  Out  There  The  Walkers  They  They  They  They  Indiscriminate  They're  Not  Going  To  Say  Oh  He's  The  Lead  So  We  Better  Not  Kill  Him  You  Know  They're  Just  Going  For  All  Of  Us  And  That's  That's  Important  You  Ever  Been  In  A  Scene  With  Somebody  Who  Really  Stinks  Not  Necessarily  On  This  Show  No  No  No  Who's  Just  An  Awful  Actor  Not  For  A  Long  Long  Long  Time  Daniel  Day  Lewis  It  Would 
[03:02:00]  Be  Great  You  You're  Supposed  To  Do  No  I  Mean  Not  For  A  Long  Time  When  You  First  Start  There's  A  Little  Bit  Of  That  But  No  Not  For  For  For  Ages  No  I've  Been  Privileged  Enough  To  Great  Actors  What  Did  You  Do  Before  You  Acted  I  Was  A  Barman  Really  I  Mean  I  Wanted  To  Act  From  A  Very  Early  Age  I 
[03:02:30]  You  Got  Knocked  Out  A  Few  Times  Yeah  So  How  Does  That  Feel  Yeah  It  Only  Feels  In  Retrospect  Really  For  Me  It  Was  That  Thing  Of  Like  You  Don't  Know  Anything  That's  Happened  It's  Suddenly  The  Light  You  Know  All  Those  Clichés  The  Lights  Go  Out  The  Bells  Start  Ringing  And  The  You  Don't  Feel  It  You  Don't  Feel  It  Until  You  Later  On  And  You  Feel  It  For  Me  The  First  Time  It  Happened  I  Realized  That  Something  Wrong  Had 
[03:03:00]  Happened  When  I  Looked  At  My  Trainer's  Face  And  He  Looked  Worried  For  The  First  Time  It  So  That  Was  Really  So  When  I  Came  Into  Acting  It  Was  Like  I'm  Getting  The  Same 
[03:03:30]  Buzz  Here  It's  The  Same  Atmosphere  Same  Dressing  Room  Same  Butterflies  In  My  Gut  But  No  One  Unless  You're  Working  With  Michael  Rucker  He  Seems  Like  A  Real  Hardcore  Guy  He  Was  In  Mississippi  Burning  And  He  Was  Great  And  He  Was  In  JFK  Right  Yeah  He  Is  A  Great  Act  Henry  Serial  And  He's  A  Great  Actor  But  You  Know  There's  A  Very  Physical  Show  So

[03:06:00]  Thing  For  Me  At  That  Time  In  My  Life  It  Was  Just  Want to  See  What  You  Can  Do  What  No  Don't  Accident  Let's  Keep  This  Going  Get  It  Like  Old  Times  You 
[03:06:30]  Hearing  About  The  Beatles  It  From  Liverpool  Yeah  That's  That's  The  One  But  It's  It's  A  City  It's  A  Big  Working  Class  City  And  It's  Tough  And  When  I  Was  Growing  Up  It  Was  Another  Recession  So  It  Was  Quite  Tough  But  As I  Say  The  Thing  I  Loved  About  Boxing  Was  The  Gym  And  The  Camaraderie  And  That  Sort  Of  You  Well  Weren't  They  The  Tougher  Like  There  Was  This  Big  Thing  That  The  Stones  Were  These  Tough  Fucking  Middle  Class  People  Well  That's  That  Was  Built  Up  By  The  Management  Really  I  Mean  You  Know  Everyone  Said  Keith  Richards 
[03:07:00]  Says  Particularly  When  The  Beatles  Came  To  America  They  Had  The  White  Hat  And  They  Worn  Black  And  What  Was  Left  Was  The  Black  And  That  That  Was  The  Stones  Did  But  They  Manufactured  That  I  Mean  Lennon  Was  A  Middle  Class  Boys  So  Was  Jagger  Really  But  You  Know  They  Were  Really  No  One  Could  Ever  Call  Ringo  Star  Middle  Class  You  Know  Or  George  Harrison  Even  McCartney  Really  They  Came  From  Tough  Neighbourhood  But  Music  Rescued  Oh  They  Were  Broke  They  Were  Yeah  They  Came  From  But  Music 
[03:07:30]  Rescued  Them  Liverpool  Was  Always  A  Big  Musical  City  And  The  Advantage  That  They  Had  Was  It  Was  On  The  And  When  The  Beatles  Came  Back  To  America  With  That  Influence  You  Know  It  Was  Like  People  Were  Hearing  That  Music  For  The  First  Time  Some  People  Because  They  Had  Been  Brought  From  The  Ships  So  They  Had  Access  To  The  Music  It  Wasn't  Like  Now  Where  They  Could  Download  It  They  Would  Stay  On  The  Docks  And  Wait  For  The  American  Ships  To  Come  In  Or  The  The 
[03:08:00]  Sailors  Would  Sell  Them  These  Records  How  Strange  Is  That  But  The  Weird  Thing  Is  That  They  Cherished  It  More  They  Loved  It  You  Know  What  Is  So  Many  Of  Those  English  Invasion  Guys  I've  Met  And  They  Know  So  Much  About  American  Music  Like  You'll  Bring  Up  A  Muddy  Water  Song  They  Know  Who  Played  Bass  They  Know  So  Much  More  Than  Americans  Do  They  Have  So  Much  More  Of  There's  That  Great  Movie  Hail  Hail  Rock  And  Roll  Where  Keith  Richards  Helps  Chuck Berry 
[03:08:30]  Put on  A concert  Back  In  His  Hometown  And  They're  Rehearsing  It  And  Chuck  Berry  Starts  To  Play  Johnny  B  Good  And  Keith  Richard  Turns  You  Don't  Play  It  Like  That  I  Listened  To  That  Record  Till  There  Was  A  Hole  In  The  Vinyl  And  You  Never  Played  It  Like  That  And  Barry  Was  Like  Oh  Yeah  And  In  A  Way  For  Those  Guys  Particularly  In  The  Stones  I  Think  Their  Love  Of  Music  And  Their  Geekiness 
[03:09:00]  About  Absolutely  That's  What  Saved  Their  Life  You  Know  Brian  Jones  In  A  Way  He  Got  Sidetracked  Because  The  Music  In  The  End  Was  The  Drugs  Meant  More  To  The  Music  Whereas  Rich  Is  Always  The  Music  I  Mean  I  Know  We  Went  Out  There  Sometimes  But  The  Music  What  Brought  Back  In  The  Studio  And  The  Love  Of  Stones  And  My  Favorite  Which  Was  The  Faces  I  Think  The  Faces  The 
[03:09:30]  Greatest  Band  I  Don't  Know  The  Faces  Ronnie  Lane  And  Rod  Stewart  And  Ronnie  Wood  Was  In  The  Faces  Kenny  Jones  Was  Playing  Drums  But  They  Were  The  Early  Rod  Stewart  Stuff  They  Were  Also  On  Those  Records  It  Was  Such  A  Great  Well  It  Was  Always  The  Faces  And  Then  It  Became  Rod  Stewart  And  The  Faces  And  They  Became  Rod  Stewart  But  They  Were  Still  Playing  When  Did  This  Happen  It  Was  All  The  Same  Stuff  But  The  Record  Companies  Were  Just  Changing  Stuff  Rod 
[03:10:00]  Where  They  All  Used  To  Go  And  Play  On  This  Little  Estuary  In  Essex  And  So  Many  Bands  Came  From  There  The  Stones  The  Faces  And  You  Would  See  All  Those  Guys  In 
[03:10:30]  Clubs  And  Shit  When  You  Were  Growing  Up  I  Didn't  They  Were  A  Generation  Of  Me  Quite  A  Few  Generations  But  Their  Music  Really  Still  Resounded  And  Coming  From  My  City  Which  Is  A  Very  Serious  Musical  City  It  Wasn't  Weird  It  Wasn't  Like  Saying  You  Wanted  To  Be  An  Astronaut  The  Only  Thing  That  Was  Weird  Was  I  Wasn't  Saying  I  Wanted  To  Be  In

[03:21:30]  Back  You  Up  Yeah  Because  Every  Funny  Guy  Needs  A  Couple  Straight  Men  You  Know  I  Love  Having  Days  When  Opie  And  Ron  Do  The  Show  I  Like  When  They  They  End  Up  Getting  Into  Radio  Stories  And  They're  Always  Fantastic  I  Love  It  When  They  Talk  About  Radio  But  Then  It  Also  Looking  Like  They're  Talking  About  When  Creative  People  Were  On  The  Radio  And  There  Were  Shows  Coming  Up  And  There  Was  Competition  And 
[03:22:00]  People  Were  Doing  Stuff  And  Then  You're  Like  That's  Just  It  Doesn't  Exist  Anymore  Now  It's  Pay  No  Mind  Now  Everybody  Just  Gets  Put  On  The  Pay  No  Mind  List  Unless  It's  Already  Established  Unless  We  Know  Unless  It's  Already  Worked  And  We  Can  Put  It  On  Or  You're  On  TV  We're  Not  Putting  It  On  Right  Unless  You're  Coming  In  With  A  Fan  Base  We're  Not  Going  To  Give  You  An  Opportunity  To  Grow  One  Was  It  Ron  Had  A  Brilliant  Idea  He  Did  Start  Literally  Start  A  Farm  League  You  Know  I  Mean  Part  Of  Part  Of  Where  This  All  Started  Happening  Was  When 
[03:22:30]  Big  Companies  Started  Buying  Up  All  These  Radio  Stations  So  Radio  Stations  Weren't  Really  Independent  Anymore  So  You  Go  Fine  Let's  Use  That  To  The  Advantage  And  We  Have  All  These  Stations  Like  Ron  Said  We  Build  A  Farm  League  And  Blah  Blah  Blah  But  He  Said  It  And  This  Is  The  Part  That  Everybody  Everybody  Comes up  With  These  Ideas  And  Everybody  Gives  Me  Advice  On  What  I  Should  Do  In  What  I  Should  Pitch  To  People  Around  Here  In 
[03:23:00]  That's  The  Whole  Thing  Nobody  Spending  Any  Money  Nobody  Wants  To  Pay  Anybody  To  Do  This  Anymore  Unless  They  Been  Doing  It  For  Years  But  They'll  Let  You  Do  It  For  Plugs  Yeah  Yeah  If  You  Got  Something  To  Plug  Or  If  You'll  Just  Do  It  For  Free  Then  Have  At  It  Boys  Was  Enjoy  The  Mikes  Was  It  Depressing  During  That  Whole  Discussion  When  You  Know  These  Guys  Who  Obviously  Made  Huge  Names  For  Themselves  In  This  Industry  Are  Looking  Over  At  You  And 
[03:23:30]  Pretty  Much  Saying  You're  Part  Of  A  Dying  Breed  You're  The  Last  Of  What's  There  You  Know  What's  Funny  About  What's  Happened  Is  That  Originally  When  Like  When  Opie  And  Ron  Talked  To  Me  Before  They  Would  Say  Things  Like  You  You  Got  To  Go  Out  There  And  Do  It  You  Got  To  Start  Sending  Tapes  Out  You  Got  To  Start  Doing  This  You  Got  To  Start  Doing  That  And  They're  And  They're  Realizing  That  The  Industry  Is  Not  Doesn't  Work  That  That's  Not  The  Industry  Anymore  That  It  Doesn't  Work  The  Way  It  Work  For  Them  So  I  Can  See  It  In  Their  Eyes  Like  When  Ron  And  Opie  Are  Talking 
[03:24:00]  To  Me  And  Giving  Me  Advice  About  Where  To  Go  With  Radio  And  Everything  They're  Like  They  Have  This  Strange  Sympathetic  Look  As  If  To  Say  You're  Fuck  Dude  I  Don't  Know  What  To  Tell  You  Anymore  You  Did  Everything  It's  Not  The  Business  That  They  Used  To  Know  Right  Nobody  Knows  This  Anymore  Nobody  There  Is  Not  Anybody  Who  Knows  This  Business  There's  No  Advice  There's  No  Way  To  Succeed  Anymore  But  If  You  Took  Guys  Who  Have  Like  The  Guys  Who 
[03:24:30]  Work  Here  Have  Experience  In  Radio  The  Guys  In  Management  But  It's  All  Experience  In  Managing  Radio  Like  If  Any  Of  Those  Guys  Had  The  Experience  That  They  Have  And  An  Ounce  Of  The  Creative  Thought  That  Guys  Like  Opie  And  Ron  Have  We  Could  Figure  Something  Out  We  Could  Go  To  The  Next  Level  But  Nobody  Is  Interested  In  Going  To  The  Next  What  I  Want  To  Try  This  And  I'll  Put  My  Name  Behind

Is  Already  Pretty  Much  Covered  Right  Well  The  Thing  Is  And  This  Is  What  We  Were  Talking  About  They  Definitely  Need  To  Do  Other  Morning  Shows  Because  Opie  And  Anthony  They're  Simply  Not  Going  To  Exist  Forever  And  Neither  Is  Howard  Stern  So  Once  You know  You have  To have  Other  Shows  That 
[03:33:30]  Are  Ready  To  Fill  In  In  A  Moment's  Notice  Once  Your  Established  Shows  Are  Gone  You  Got  To  Have  Another  Generation  Of  Shows  Right  So  Who's  Your  Second  Person  Going  To  Be  Sam  Roberts  Sam  Roberts  And  Sam  Roberts  Both  Of  Them  What  Do  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  Well  If  You  Want  To  Take  Over  Opie  Anthony  God  Forbid  That  They  Don't  Want  To  Do  Radio  Any  I'm  Not  Just  Going  To  Do  Their  Show  And  Have  Like  I'll  Be  Opie  And  Like

[03:34:30]  SiriusXM  Is  They  Do  A  Good  Job  Of  Promoting  The  Brand  People  Are  Aware  At  Least  Sirius  People  Know  What  It  Is  When  You  Say  Satellite  Radio  People  Say  Sirius  Right  They  Have  Done  A  Good  Job  Of  Getting  That  Brand  Out  There  The  Internet  Shit  Is  Really  Coming  Together  The  On  Demand  Stuff  Is  Awesome  Everything  Is  On  Demand  And  I  Mean  For  Me  It  Works  All  The  The  On  Demand  Stuff  They  Got  Other  Stuff  Up  The  You  Know  Up  The  Tunnel 
[03:35:00]  That's  Coming  But  You  Can  Have  All  That  If  You  Don't  Have  Content  What  Do  You  Have  Well  That's  What  I'm  Saying  That's  Why  You  Need  To  Develop  So  Beyond  Opie  Anthony  Howard  Stern  Because  That's  What  Separates  Sirius  XM  From  All  These  Other  Dumb  Internet  Things  Is  That  We  Actually  Have  Exclusive  Content  But  What  Happens  When  Those  Shows  Are  Gone  And  It's  Your  Turn  To  Step  Up  And  You're  Focusing  On  This  And  This  Isn't  Even  The  Shit  Anymore  What  Do  You  Mean  What  What  Happens  If  It's  Now  Like  Moved  To  Something  Like  An  Internet  Company  Like
