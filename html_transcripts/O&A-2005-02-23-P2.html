<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with intern Nathaniel performing a stand-up routine filled with expletives, detailing his parents' tumultuous divorce and his mother's herbal supplement obsession.  This was followed by a listener call-in segment featuring harrowing tales of disastrous holiday experiences, including family conflicts, infidelity, violence, parental abandonment, and even a girlfriend's mother's death and a caller recounting his girlfriend's incestuous pregnancy at age 12.  The hosts interjected frequently with their own jokes and comments.  One caller shared a humiliating story about his upstairs neighbor sleeping with a woman he was pursuing, leading to a discussion of his dating prospects.  The hosts gave their advice.  Nathaniel's appearances in several commercials were also mentioned.

The show then shifted to a segment dominated by Mike from Buffalo's dating woes, specifically his pursuit of a woman involved with a Navy man. The hosts relentlessly mocked his "nice guy" approach. Mike shared a graphic story involving a used tampon found during oral sex with another woman.  The hosts offered various dating suggestions.  Concurrently, a host described an awkward encounter with an enthusiastic employee of NY Confidential after delivering an air check.  Studio guest Erica brought in a used loveseat, prompting a blacklight inspection for stains and humorous speculation.  Erica also discussed her anxiety, a cancelled wedding due to financial difficulties from her antique furniture store's closure, and her relationship with Ben.

Next, a woman brought gifts to the studio: a fragile dish (which Opie immediately broke), beer pitchers, and a hatbox containing vintage poker chips and playing cards, including a deck missing cards and a deck from the "Moshe Suck Valley Railroad Company".  Opie’s callous treatment of the gifts caused the woman to leave in tears.  This was followed by an interview with Connie, a sales representative for a sex toy called "The Liberator," alongside numerous emails received about producer Ben's appearance during the interview.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a yearly list of dangerous toys.

The show then transitioned into a segment beginning with morbid jokes about children's toys referencing various tragedies and public figures.  Listener calls added to the dark humor.  The conversation turned to hazardous toys from the hosts' childhoods, like lawn darts and click clacks.  Guest Bob Kelly recounted an embarrassing encounter with Jerry Seinfeld. A phone interview with Shannon Mullin, author of "The Best You'll Ever Have," followed.  The conversation covered sexual myths, the G-spot, sex toys, and various sexual practices, punctuated by crude commentary from the hosts and callers.  Listener calls continued with sexually explicit and darkly humorous themes.

The final segment featured continued calls for Shannon Mullin, covering topics ranging from homosexual activity in prison (a call from incarcerated Scott), childhood oral sex (“Monster Rain” from caller Bill), a comedian’s (Wool Jimmy) habit of having prostitutes urinate on his throat (with voicemails from his concerned mother and Connor’s mother), “pussy farts,” and a caller who accidentally solicited a male prostitute. The segment ended abruptly due to technical difficulties and dropped calls with Shannon Mullin, with the hosts speculating on her reasons for disconnecting.  Bernie Getz was announced as the next day's guest.

[00:02:30]  ¶¶  ¶¶  ¶¶  ¶¶  ¶¶  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Some people don't like you to mention certain things.  Some people don't want you to say this.  Some people don't want you to say that.  Some people think if you mention some things, they might happen. 
[00:04:00]  Some people are really fucking stupid.  Pick me.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Guys, we've got to bring Nathaniel in here.  We promised him that we would listen to his stand-up.  Oh, yes.  Well, we promised him a while ago.  Well, because he took the smell from Rich Voss' ear.  That's right.  Opie, this is coming off of seeing Brian Regan over the weekend.  I understand that.  So it's a tough act to follow.  Well, we were going to do it on Friday after Brian Regan was in here, but we didn't think  it would be fair to the guy.  True.  Nathaniel's our intern, and he does stand-up and all sorts of things on the side. 
[00:04:30]  How long have you been doing stand-up?  About six months.  Six months.  Very new at it.  Yes.  Did you have anything that inspired you to become a comic?  No.  I mean, I've always enjoyed the stylings of Jim Norton.  Who doesn't?  But, yeah, I just wanted to make people laugh.  Yeah.  And have you throughout your life?  Have you been known as, like, the funny guy?  Yes.  I guess so.  You have.  And was there anything that happened, though, that was like, wow, you know, because you  just decided to go into comedy. 
[00:05:00]  Did you see somebody, go, I could do that, kind of?  Yeah, I just took, sorry, my story sucks.  I just took a class and decided to give it a shot.  A comedy class?  Yeah.  Who taught it?  Uh-oh.  See, this is what I was digging for, people.  Yeah, what's up with these comedy classes?  Well, um, you...  Isn't it tough to teach someone to be funny?  You either have it or not?  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know anybody who's ever done well coming out of a class, but it doesn't mean  that there's not.  No, no, I probably don't know that they took it.  Do they teach you, like, techniques?  No, it's mostly, like, writing and making sure you have, like, a point of view and identity. 
[00:05:30]  I mean, some people show up and you're like, I can't wait for this person to give  up comedy, but...  Am I really?  Yeah, just because you go through this class doesn't mean you're going to come out the  other end funny, but just because you go to it also doesn't mean that you're not funny.  That's correct.  If you're naturally funny, you're going to go through it, take out of it what you can,  and then you move on and realize it was worthless and have to gig every night obsessively like  Jim Norton does.  Yeah, the one I took two years ago, which turned into nothing, was taught by David LaBarca.  Oh, David LaBarca, he was related to Joe Ansis, who died, unfortunately, who was the guy 
[00:06:00]  that gave Lenny Bruce his whole lingo.  Really?  Yeah, like, you know, like, hey, daddy, yo, all that stuff.  Joe used to hang out at Dangerfields, man, he was a very interesting guy.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, he knew Lenny well.  He was one of the funniest guys, but he would never go on stage.  Isn't the best way to...  Just do it.  ...do it is just to do it.  Just go to the clubs and gig everywhere and take your crap nights where you bomb and take  your good nights where you kill and then just keep doing it. 
[00:06:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah, for the past six months I've been trying to do, like, three open mics a week and...  Nice.  That's pretty good.  Very good.  ...subject myself to that hell.  You got to bring people with you?  No, these are just five bucks for stage time and tell jokes to comedians who won't laugh.  Yeah.  You pay five bucks to get on?  Yep.  That's something.  Five bucks.  That's pretty funny.  For a bunch of cynical, jaded asses that are just waiting to go on themselves, so...  Right, right.  That's pretty much the whole audience is the guys that are paying five bucks to get up there.  Yep.  Wow.  That's delightful.  Really fast, we've got to rewind slightly. 
[00:07:00]  Larry in New York, what's a mezuzah?  Oh, and hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen, the mezuzah is put on the door frame by Jewish people.  It prevents evil spirits from entering your house, which means Norton can never see Anthony's  Christmas tree.  Well, Anthony took the mezuzah off.  Yeah, he took it off.  I took off my mezuzahs.  I don't want them there.  It would be great if I left it on my door and some Arabs attack me thinking I was Jewish. 
[00:07:30]  Exactly.  To explain that I'm not.  Something tells me in the area you're looking at for an apartment, there's a mezuzah on every  door.  Yeah, there are a lot.  Yeah.  You know what?  Jewish people make fine neighbors.  They don't cause a problem.  They don't join gangs, unless you consider bankers' gangs.  They're wonderful neighbors.  I'd be happy to live among all Jews.  We're all gays.  They're great neighbors, too.  Just got to smell that awful food that they cook.  No worse than my gassers, Ant.  Believe me, they'll be complaining about me.  They'll just be going, hmm, who's cooking the matzo ball soup? 
[00:08:00]  Jews are fine neighbors.  All right, so we got Nathaniel's...  Do you mean Norton Berg?  His last appearance at Caroline's.  This was about a week ago, right?  Yeah.  A week ago tonight, I think.  Yeah, it's one of the worst intros ever, too.  Well, you checked off the ones you want us to play, right?  Yes.  Okay, so this is Nathaniel's, and this is the intro, and him getting his act going on.  Is this CD you're playing available on eatabullet.com?  Were you selling it December 23rd at the downtown?  Yes. 
[00:08:30]  Naughty Nathaniel?  Now that would work.  All right, let's listen to Nathaniel's act here.  All right.  From the Connecticut, welcome Nathaniel Brian.  From the Connecticut.  There we go.  There we go.  Mm-hmm.  Where were you in the lot?  Hi.  Oh.  Does anybody else's mom get a huge kick out of humiliating them? 
[00:09:00]  She's taking a poll.  Mine does.  She started pretty early with my name, actually.  She and my dad teamed up to give me the nickname Than for Nathaniel, instead of Nat, Nate, or Nathan,  which is an awesome nickname if you never want to pick up a chick at a bar.  Because most of the conversations go something like, hi, I'm Than.  Stan?  Than.  Sam. 
[00:09:30]  We're not hooking up.  We're not hooking up.  The conversation has run its course.  I actually introduced myself to this one man.  I was like, hi, I'm Than.  And he goes, oh, is that Vietnamese?  I can only guess he was looking at my Asian features. 
[00:10:00]  Turns out he was wrong.  I'm Korean.  But I guess we all look the same to you, don't we, asshole?  That's good.  Getting some big laughs, actually.  Yeah.  Sounds very natural, too.  Yeah, the mix is a little bad, I think.  You kind of have that relaxed guy thing.  What, do you come up on stage and it was kind of a long time in between, you know,  when they announced you and the applause stop before you said something.  So what, do you just kind of like stroll around, look at the crowd? 
[00:10:30]  No, I just like put my bottle of water down.  Oh, was that it?  Yeah.  You don't want to look too eager?  Yeah.  High-fiving like Leno before you go on?  High-fiving the crowd in front.  The opening joke's a little, not a bad opening joke, it's a little bit slow.  Aside from that, it's good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's not bad.  Except he breathed like La Mata when he was doing material.  All you wonderful people.  Going back to the phones for one second here. 
[00:11:00]  Jay in Indiana.  Yes, Jay, real fast.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Love your show.  If you want to know how good Jewish neighbors are, just look at A. and Frank's family.  They were great neighbors.  Never made a sound.  I'm punching out.  Oh, God.  First of all, what do you mean Anne Frank's neighbors?  Anne Frank was Jewish.  The German people were her landlords, technically.  He's saying that the Jews were quiet.  They never said a word.  Yeah, we're quiet.  The Jewish neighbors.  And he's talking about the Franks, I guess. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  Never heard them partying up a storm or anything.  All right, here's more of Nathaniel's show at Caroline's last week.  My mom's big into self-improvement.  She takes a lot of herbal supplements.  She takes, like, 30 pills every morning, which is a lot.  I've asked her, you know, what could you possibly need 30 pills for?  She said, like, well, this one's for memory and this one's for my immune system.  I like to ask her, which one gets Dad to move back in?  That's pretty funny.  Apparently none of them is the answer. 
[00:12:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Hey.  Is this thing on?  Hello?  It wasn't a bad joke, you know.  It was very good.  It wasn't bad at all.  So Dad left Mom, huh?  Yeah.  On Father's Day, I helped him move out.  It was great.  Are you kidding?  No.  How long ago?  Three, four years, five years.  You helped him move out?  Yeah.  On Father's Day?  Yes.  And what was he saying to you as you were loading the truck with his stuff?  There was no surprise, really.  I was happy for him.  Proud of him. 
[00:12:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, you saw a lot of fighting growing up and...  Yeah, well...  What was the big problem with your parents?  It was all verbal.  Actually, I think my next bit...  Oh, really?  My...  Oh, look at how he...  Oh, he is good.  My axe speaks for itself.  He is good.  Well, let's take a listen and find out the answer to that question.  Yeah, my parents are divorced.  There were some early warning signs.  Um...  Dinner conversation was one of them.  Uh...  They sort of went along the lines of, um...  Lowell, why don't you put that fat from the steak directly on your chin? 
[00:13:00]  To which my dad would reply, um...  You're the one who cooked it, bitch.  Really, I'm just happy that a man named Lowell got laid and made me.  That is a tough first name.  God bless him.  Problems at the home, yeah.  Yeah.  It was just like... 
[00:13:30]  I would be, you know...  Well, not to bring the show down too much, but I wouldn't want to have friends over too  much unless they were already in the circle and knew that it was going to be...  You knew that you're just going to hear them yelling at each other?  Yeah.  I had the yelling parents too growing up until they got divorced and it was just, you know...  Oh, can't you two just shut the fuck up for like one night?  For one night, always...  Hey, son of a bitch!  And then you'd see like the old man would take the plate full of spaghetti and throw  it and it would hit like the wall next to the phone and slow... 
[00:14:00]  And you're sitting there horrified watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall.  Like, oh...  Fuck you!  Get the fuck out of this!  Oh, fuck you!  Oh, and the horrified kids just sitting there.  Did that actually leave?  After the fights?  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  Huh.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep because the yelling would stop.  Yeah.  That's, you know, first mom would have to wind down a little.  You know, even after dad left, she's still going, you know.  Ah, fucking asshole! 
[00:14:30]  Eat that shit like I need a fucking hole in the head!  Son of a bitch!  Comes in here and...  I'm trying to sleep!  He's gone!  Shut up!  Just shut up!  Oh.  Make me...  I'll tell him they're going to fuck himself if he can fucking...  He's coming back!  No way!  Is that...  Oh, God.  He's been gone a half hour.  When would he come back?  The next day?  Yeah, like the next day.  And then everything would be all right?  To go sleep with or something.  Would everything be okay the next day and they would... 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, like it would just...  You'd resume again, I guess, like normal life.  Would they go upstairs, have sex, make up sex and all that?  I guess.  I wasn't too...  Until the next fight?  I didn't have much of a perception of that kind of thing.  But I guess, yeah, if everything was fine.  And, you know, they'd be sitting down watching like Ronan Martin's laughing, laughing, everything  was fine, you know?  And then out of nowhere, it just...  You'd hear the rumbling.  You'd be in bed and you'd hear like...  Outside the door, just talking.  Just talking.  What do you mean by that? 
[00:15:30]  It's like Ronan Martin's laughing is on, you know?  So they're kind of laughing.  And then you'd hear...  And then you'd hear from the kids' room.  Oh, God, the trauma.  It was always creepy, like, anniversaries and birthdays would be like, they'd fake it 
[00:16:00]  for a day.  And it was just so creepy, like, oh, yeah, we're buying it, you love each other today.  Sure.  Yeah, yeah.  Here's the gift.  Oh, we got her a vacuum.  It's a real loving gift.  My dad actually once got my mom a porcelain figurine of a warthog for Mother's Day.  If that doesn't speak volumes, passive-aggressive, yeah.  Oh.  That's hilarious. 
[00:16:30]  And then we were pretty young, so, you know, we got the talk.  Like, I realized...  Yeah, and we all knew, like, we were real young, but it was so obvious.  You know, oh, Dad only comes home on the weekends now because he's at work?  Shut up.  You're insulting me.  And then we got, you know, called into the room and Mom sits down and goes,  me and your father are, I want you to know, and I want you to know it has nothing to do with you,  but we're divorced. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, okay.  Can I go out and play now?  How is this going to change my life?  Does this mean I don't have to listen to...  Oh, it does?  Okay.  So it's a good thing.  Great.  Good.  Well, thank you for staying together for so long and really, like, torturing us.  You couldn't have pulled this one, like, five years ago?  You know, when maybe we couldn't remember as much and didn't have to listen to the yelling and screaming?  This was supposed to be about his commentary.  Yeah, I know.  Holy mackerel.  All of a sudden...  We're all just staring at Anthony like, make it stop. 
[00:17:30]  All of a sudden, it's about me.  I kind of feel like you did in your room while listening to your parents.  A little uncomfortable, Anthony.  Here's an idea, Pop.  There you go.  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp.  Give that a whirl.  Sorry, it's not about me.  It's kind of, you know, look at...  Hey, your act touched the nerve.  There you go.  It's good stuff.  How about that?  And I must say, mine isn't the worst case scenario, that's for sure. 
[00:18:00]  I knew a girl once, remain nameless, whose father walked out on the family on Christmas Day.  On Christmas Day!  That little tidbit of baggage will stick with a girl for a while.  Makes Christmas a fucking treat for year after year.  Let me tell you that one.  Hey, here's a present.  Yeah, my daddy left on Christmas.  Fucking Christmas.  Here it is again.  Merry Christmas! 
[00:18:30]  I think I know who you're talking about.  Oh, my God!  Oh, no.  I gotta go...  I don't know.  Christmas Day.  Do you know how this screws up Christmas?  Let's go take a leak, Jimmy.  Do you know if a father has to be that goddamn selfish, he can't wait till the 26th?  You can't wait a day?  He's gotta screw up Christmas.  And, you know, fine, screw up your own family.  Do you realize you're screwing it up for every guy that's trying to make a relationship with your daughter?  Because every Christmas, you, especially the first one, takes you by complete surprise. 
[00:19:00]  Everything's fine and dandy.  That's hilarious.  You're thinking, oh, man, this is a special day.  I just started dating this girl.  It's our first Christmas together.  First Christmas together.  I got a nice stack of presents for her.  I've been listening to Christmas carols in my car all the way over to her house.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
[00:19:30]  You can't see that one coming.  It's so true.  You can't see that one coming until the 25th,  until old St. Nick is supposed to be wiggling his fat ass down the goddamn chimney.  That's when you figure that one out.  My father left on Christmas. 
[00:20:00]  Thank you, Pop.  Job well done.  At that point, you should have just taken all our presents and thrown them in the fire.  Exactly.  It would have been a happier moment.  He did.  He left on Christmas.  Goodbye.  I'm going.  Well, that's what you should have said.  And you know what?  I'm taking his lead.  I'm off.  Well, you did do that, but I think ten years later, right?  It wasn't Christmas.  Oh, you should have waited until Christmas, though.  You really should have waited until Christmas.  You should have had that vicious intuition and waited until Christmas. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, my God.  And say, I now understand why he left you.  That would have been a bad one.  And slammed the door.  That's just not that mean.  I'm leaving.  It just really isn't that mean when it comes down to it.  Anthony is a very nice guy.  I know you.  Dress in a Santa cap.  That is spying away from the house.  That whole baggage thing when you get into a relationship, you have no idea.  You think you got it all figured out until a holiday comes or Father's Day, in my case.  You think you got it figured out.  Oh, Jesus.  Father's Day, in my case, was the big one.  Why was that a big one? 
[00:21:00]  Door slamming and crying all day.  I'm like, what the hell happened here?  Isn't that great?  Aren't the dates of what things happened just tragic?  Jeez.  They come out of nowhere.  Oh, the Christmas.  I got the visual, though.  You got the gifts all piled up nice.  Probably wrote out a nice card.  Knowing you, you might even have had a Santa hat on because it was your first Christmas.  Really just giving it your best.  Giving it my all, by gosh.  Yeah.  Dude, one of the worst cases of chick baggage I ever had came out of nowhere because this 
[00:21:30]  wasn't on a specific date or anything.  One day, my girlfriend just burst into tears out of nowhere.  And, oh, no, nothing, nothing.  Is this a girl that I don't know?  Yeah, this is one I don't know from years ago.  All right.  It's like, what happened?  What's the matter?  Blah, blah, blah.  Nothing, nothing, nothing.  Jesus Christ, what's wrong?  So, every year, around this time of day, she started getting a little weird.  And I never knew what the hell it was. 
[00:22:00]  Find out her mother was an alcoholic, always drunk.  She was leaving for school one day.  And she says goodbye to her mom every day.  And her mother's always, like, drunk, passed out or something like that.  So, one day, she's passed out on the kitchen floor.  And she says goodbye to her and goes to school.  She comes back, her mother's dead on the floor.  She had slipped and cracked her head on the counter.  And when she said goodbye to her in the morning, she was already, like, she had already hit her head. 
[00:22:30]  So, maybe, you know, I'm sure she went through years of thinking, if I only call up the hospital, blah, blah, blah.  She left her there on the floor because she had always been passed out.  So, when did you try to help this bad, bad girl?  I know.  I said, jeez, miss, not paying any attention to anything.  Yeah, I tried to help her.  No, you don't help.  It's just baggage.  So, that was obviously the anniversary of the death, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  The anniversary of that every year.  Jesus, and you'd see it coming from weeks away, and you're like, oh, it's that day.  You'd see it bubbling under the surface.  Oh, it's mom clocked her head on the edge of the counter day.  Spend the whole day waxing the kitchen floor.  Oh, my God.  You know, there's no Hallmark card to get her for that occasion.  Yep.  So, your mom whacked her head on the counter.  Sorry to hear whoops-a-daisy. 
[00:23:30]  Whoops-a-daisy.  Whoops.  Whoosh.  Crash.  A little cartoon.  Bringing up some memories really fast on the phones, and then we'll go back to Nathaniel's  commentary.  Yeah, I don't want to shut him out.  It's his day.  Bill on Long Island.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Bill.  What's up?  Oh, Bill.  Christmas.  I was like four years old, and everything's going great.  And then, for some reason, my grandpa locks himself in the basement, and my dad drives  away, and I don't see him.  It's Christmas Eve, and I'm a little four-year-old. 
[00:24:00]  I'm like, where's Daddy gone?  And apparently, it was a huge fight, and Daddy didn't come back for a few days.  And then next year, the exact same thing happened again.  Every year?  Yeah, the worst.  And no one ever told me why.  Now, that story's kind of sad, but Tennessee always beats out any sad story.  Let's go to Jim in Tennessee.  Listen to this one.  Go ahead, Jim.  Hey.  Tell your cute story.  Go ahead.  Okay. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's a funny story.  We should have Christmas songs playing.  Yeah, hold on.  Hold on.  We need a nice Christmas song.  Wait a minute, Bob.  If we're going to do this bit, we've got to get some Christmas music.  There we go.  All right, Jim.  Go ahead.  Calm it down a little so we can hear his story.  Tell your cute little Christmas story.  Okay, my father, his birthday is on Christmas.  It gets plastered.  He's in the Air Force.  He's a Chief Master Sergeant.  He comes home.  My sister's pouring his whiskey out down the sink so he doesn't get any more plastered. 
[00:25:00]  He takes the bottle and commences to busting her over the head with it.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, 16 stitches.  And, you know, he was a Chief Master Sergeant.  Nobody was going to cough.  Of course.  Nobody was going to, you know, take him to jail.  Well, that must have been a Merry Christmas.  Yeah, Merry Christmas.  That must have been a fun, memorable Christmas for the kids. 
[00:25:30]  I have a worst Christmas story.  I don't want to tell you, I never told it on the air.  Oh, come on, Jimmy.  I just remember one year my friend was married and he didn't want to be married.  He took a little boat ride.  Oh, God.  Why does it always have to go back to the little Connor Peterson?  Why, why, why? 
[00:26:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  All right, we have another one, Anthony.  Dave in Queens.  Dave, go ahead.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Hi.  Hey, a little nervous, guys.  Hi, boo-boo.  Hi, Frida.  Love you, Frida.  Can you hear me?  Yes, Frida.  I was married for about two years and I was, you know, the sex was always a little weird  with my ex-wife, with my wife at the time.  And she told me, can you hear me, guys?  Yep.  Yeah, Frida.  She told me that her father got her pregnant when she was 12. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Make a long story short, it didn't work out well.  Dude, if I heard that story, my girlfriend would wonder why every Christmas I had a throbbing  heart on.  Well, you know what?  In actuality, starting one time, I was joking around saying, who's your daddy?  And she just made a straight face and she said, don't say that.  Oh, wow.  I didn't take anything of it.  And then, you know, sex got weirder and weirder.  And after that, it all went down south.  Ah, what a curmudgeon she was. 
[00:27:00]  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas, everybody.  What selfish parents, man.  George in Jersey.  What about George?  What about George?  She's a selfish girl.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  This is a true story.  We're planning a big family Christmas.  Everybody's coming in from around the country.  My 70-year-old grandparents are coming up from Florida.  Three days before Christmas, my father calls me up and says, I'm going to divorce your mother,  but I'm going to tell her after Christmas.  Right.  And now we're all sitting there.  Everybody comes in.  The brothers, my brothers are sitting around the Christmas table just waiting for that special 
[00:27:30]  moment where Dad's going to say, by the way, I believe in your mother.  It was miserable.  It ruined Christmas.  It was horrible.  They're all geared up for the big, I'm getting a divorce from your mom story.  But here's the worst part.  The worst part is, is Dad goes to see a divorce attorney, finds out he's going to lose 20% of  everything that he owns, Dad's out of it, and now we're stuck with my family for Christmas  for the rest of my fucking life.  Yeah, see, it would have cost him too much, so he didn't get a divorce. 
[00:28:00]  There you go.  At least they're together for the right reasons.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  Merry Christmas.  Earl in Alabama.  What's up, Earl?  Hey, what's going on?  Come on, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I just, I'm a truck driver, and I was coming home for Thanksgiving last year, 2003.  Thanksgiving, Christmas.  Call it up.  Sure.  Well, hang on.  It all goes over the whole holiday season.  All right, let's go.  But I found out on my way home that my wife was banging a prison inmate.  We ended up signing divorce papers. 
[00:28:30]  We ended up signing divorce papers the day before Thanksgiving.  I got to come back down there on Christmas Day because, you know, because we've got a five-year-old  daughter, so to see my daughter, I had to go in there and see this guy living in my house  with my Christmas tree and everything, you know, with all my stuff.  That ruled Christmas Day, and then to rule New Year's Eve, that was our anniversary.  Oh, man.  There you have it.  Oh.  There you have it.  His wife was banging an inmate.  Merry Christmas, everybody. 
[00:29:00]  I got it from a Negro.  I thought I heard Negro.  Oh, bang, you inmates.  You can whip me all you like, white devil, but you'll never break my spirit.  I don't know where my other clips are.  I know.  I see that.  Aaron and Callie.  What's up, Aaron?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  I just got a pretty messed up Christmas story.  I was going out with my girlfriend for a few years, and I was probably 19 at the time. 
[00:29:30]  And, well, we had some problems and broke up for a while, and she decided she wanted  to get back together.  But at the time, I had already got another girlfriend, and we were living together.  Well, so my parents thought it would be a good idea to bring my old girlfriend to my  work while I was living with a new one and try and get me back together with her.  Well, basically, I was kind of pissed off, so I go home and tell the girl I'm living  with, well, hey, my parents, they brought, you know, my old girlfriend over, and they're  wanting me to get back together.  And, of course, my girlfriend's reaction is to get pissed at me and basically want to 
[00:30:00]  break up.  So I'm thinking, well, you know, maybe I should get back together with my old girlfriend,  you know, because she was pretty hot or whatever.  And so, anyway, I called her up, and we made plans to go over to her house on Christmas  Day, or I did, and got back together with the girl I was living with, and she was crying  and sniveling and whining.  And, well, basically, I felt kind of bad, so I was like, well, no, I'm going to, I called  my old girlfriend up on Christmas morning and said, sorry, I'm not coming back together, 
[00:30:30]  it's over.  And basically, all I heard was this click.  And after listening to you guys, I'm thinking she's going to have some emotional trauma for  a long period of time.  So, punch it out.  Thank God.  Too late.  I know.  Just in time.  Everyone else punched out.  You were the last one to punch out.  I didn't like it to anyone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's the guy that has to turn off the lights.  He's the last person listening to the show today.  Flip the lights on your way out. 
[00:31:00]  Lock up.  Lock up, please, because everyone else left.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, I was about nine years old.  Me and my sister had a paper route, and my father was, you know, mechanically quite,  if he wanted the grass, he would set the house on fire.  So, Christmas Eve, he comes home all drunk, he falls into the bushes, and, you know, him  and my mom have a fight, me and my sister go to bed.  I wake up like three o'clock in the morning, and I hear something in a bliver.  So, I go downstairs, and I see my father, what I thought was, taking apart these pipes 
[00:31:30]  of those, that he was actually trying to put them together.  So, I got all pissed off, and, you know, that he was taking apart the pipes that Santa left  us.  So, I start, like, throwing the presents at him.  My mother wakes up, she's screaming.  It was just a friggin' debacle.  So, your drunk dad was ruining your presents.  No, I thought he was.  He thought so.  He thought he was, but he wasn't, but he still kind of beat up his father a little bit there.  Yeah, he was trying to put them together, and I didn't put that together.  All right, nothing worse than the, uh, nothing worse than the father-son brawl. 
[00:32:00]  Never had one of those.  My father would have killed me.  But those things are just the most awful things ever, when the son is beating up the father.  I almost had one.  I picked up a stick out of the garage, and my father's like, come on, let's go in the  backyard.  Get out.  I'm like, nah.  You gave up right there, nah.  Nah, when he didn't see...  What were you picking up a stick for, you ass?  I was drunk.  I was drunk.  I was drunk.  You were drunk.  Yeah, he didn't mind the stick at all.  He was ready to take it and smash me with it.  Stuff it up your ass.  I felt, even in my drunkenness, I felt it would be prudent to replace the stick and end the 
[00:32:30]  quarrel.  You're quite a willful young boy, Jimmy Norton.  All right, let's go, uh, let's try, let's try one more.  James in Arizona.  What's up, James?  Uh, nothing much, just listening and loving.  All right.  My story is that, uh, I come back from being deployed in the army.  Yeah.  My wife was pregnant.  It wasn't mine.  I've been deployed for 13 months.  She's seven months pregnant.  We got a divorce right before Christmas. 
[00:33:00]  It was finalized on Valentine's Day exact.  Wow.  There you go.  I found that to be perfect.  What a great Christmas.  You wrecked two holidays for her.  Yeah, that was just fucking magnificent.  No, she wrecked them for him.  Yeah, that's true.  Did she try to explain the pregnancy?  Uh, yes.  She said that she slipped and fell on someone else's dick.  Slipped and fell on someone else's dick.  So hurry, darling.  Uh, Mark. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, hello?  We want to end up on an up note.  Help us out.  Yeah, my girlfriend kicked me out last year Christmas.  She boxed up all my shit and put a bow on it and left it at my apartment.  Nice one.  That's a clever girl.  And kind of funny and silly at the same time.  Oh, we got one more.  Yes, one more.  Scott in Texas.  Yes, Scott?  Yeah, when I was a kid, the little kid next door, Jimmy Norton, he forced me to play Monster  Snow under the porch on Christmas Day.  Monster Snow. 
[00:34:00]  God, we know what Monster Rain is.  What is Monster Snow?  It's when you put on snow pants.  It makes it that much more difficult to do.  Because you're both shivering.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, brr, brr.  All right, well, let's get back to Nathaniel's comedy tape.  Sure.  Yes.  Three of ten.  It's not about us, douchebag.  Yeah.  This will seg nicely into my observational humor about airplane food.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Are you serious?  I don't see that.  Oh, okay.  I was just trying to get disgust from Jimmy.  I think you're going to talk about...  I love the airplane food.  Disgust from Jimmy.  Just look at my stomach in this t-shirt. 
[00:34:30]  I think you're going to talk about country clubs here, right?  Yes.  It's Nathaniel, our intern.  Like Frank said, I am from Connecticut.  The suburbs.  Awesome.  Yeah.  Very waspy place, as you'd expect.  Actually, our local country club's motto is we will have a Jew by the year 2015.  I'm not sure if that means we're going to have a Jewish member or if they will have captured one.  That's funny.  But they're hell-bent on getting one, either way. 
[00:35:00]  Also, a very, very small black community in my town, or as we call it, Carl.  That's good.  Funny.  I like your delivery.  Thank you.  It's very deadpan.  I definitely like that delivery.  He's getting some big laughs.  Joe from Miami is saying, Nathaniel ripped off Richard Belzer's voice. 
[00:35:30]  It will still have a bell's sound to your voice.  It's not the same delivery, though.  The Jew joke is good.  The Jewish joke.  Yeah.  But you should say Jew second, I think.  Like, we will have a Jew by the year 2015.  You should say by the year 2015, we will have a Jew.  Get the funny look at the end.  It's paced better.  Oh, look at that.  The pacing's better.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's still a good joke, though.  Okay.  Here's Nathaniel talking about waiting for a subway.  But I even tried the nice white job, too, for a while. 
[00:36:00]  I worked for an investment bank, which was awesome.  Yeah.  That's about the appropriate level of enthusiasm right there.  One person clapping.  But, again, I knew it might not be for me because during the morning commute, of all things,  I'd be waiting on the subway platform being like, here comes the train.  I could take it to work or throw myself in front of it.  I wonder what the third rail tastes like. 
[00:36:30]  Probably tastes like sweet, beautiful freedom is what it tastes like.  That's very funny.  Thanks.  All right.  Let's go right to the next one.  It's Cherokee.  I was psyched, though.  I thought I was less white, actually.  I found out I was 164th Cherokee.  But I sort of thought about that, and I was like, so that means my great-great-great-grandfather 
[00:37:00]  had sex with a Native American woman, right, in the 1800s.  I have a hard time believing that was consensual.  I'm white and a descendant of a hate crime.  Good.  Wonderful news.  That's good stuff.  I was just about to criticize you for not enough rape jokes coming through.  Look at that, doing Jimmy proud. 
[00:37:30]  Like a trooper.  All right, we've got one more from Nathaniel, our intern here.  I take jiu-jitsu, too, to defend myself from some of these things.  Could you say jitsu, Jew?  It's cool, though, when you start, they're like, why do you want to take jiu-jitsu?  A lot of people say fitness or confidence, whatever.  I think my reason through them, I was like, I want to take jiu-jitsu in case I'm ever wrongfully  imprisoned and need to ward off the amorous intentions of my fellow inmates.  As soon as I said that, I was like, you know what, take that back.  I would kill for that kind of attention. 
[00:38:00]  All right, you guys have been awesome.  Thanks a lot.  Prison race, Joe.  Thank you very much.  That's some good laughs in that.  Not bad at all, man.  Very good.  Very good, Nathaniel.  And you do other things?  You do a little acting?  I think it came to everyone's attention that you're in a commercial.  Yes, I have been in several TV commercials.  Several?  Yes.  Which ones?  ETOPS.  TOPS Trading Cards Online.  Presence.  ETOPS. 
[00:38:30]  Comedy Central.  I was actually on a 30-second promo.  It was all me.  It was pretty cool.  Really?  Yep.  It was the You're Among Friends promo.  I don't know.  Among Friends.  You're Among Friends, Ricky.  It was Ruth Gordon holding your cut wrists while Martin Mull milled it out and Chris Makepeace  just sat there.  You're Among Friends, Ricky.  Come on, Hobson.  Wow, that is good. 
[00:39:00]  My bodyguard.  Yes.  And also NFL Network.  That aired during playoffs last year, which is very cool.  Yeah.  And most recently, National Geographic Channel.  National Geographic Channel.  That's the one I heard about.  Yep.  I'm in a doctor's office.  You're in a doctor's office, sitting in a chair.  Yep.  In the waiting room.  Yep.  And I also do improv and sketch on the side, too.  Oh.  That's what we've got to get a little more of in this.  That's right.  More sketches.  And he takes good coffee orders, too.  The next time you come in here, I'm going to yell, freeze. 
[00:39:30]  Freeze?  No, we don't do any of that short-form stuff.  No?  No.  All right.  From O&A Pictures comes a true story of one man's pain.  It does hurt.  And a family torn apart.  And it makes you feel really funny right after it happens.  The War of the Kumias.  I had the yelling parents, too, growing up, until they got divorced, and it was just, you  know.  And then you'd see, like, the old man would take the plate full of spaghetti and throw it,  and it would hit, like, the wall next to the phone. 
[00:40:00]  And you're sitting there, horrified, watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall.  Fuck you.  Get the fuck out of the wall.  Fuck you.  Oh, the horrified kids.  Did that actually leave after the fights?  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep, because the yelling would stop.  First mom would have to wind down a little.  That fucking asshole.  You know, even after dad left, she's still going.  Beat that shit like I need a fucking hole in the head.  I'm trying to sleep.  He's gone.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, God, he's been gone a half hour.  Did he just shut up?  The next day?  Yeah, like, the next day.  You know, they'd be sitting down watching, like, Ronan Martin's laughing, laughing.  Everything was fine, you know.  And then out of nowhere, you'd hear the rumbling.  You'd be in bed, and you'd hear, like,  And then you'd hear from the kids' room.  Can't you two just shut the fuck up for, like, one night?  And then we were pretty young, so, you know, we got, you know, called into the room, 
[00:41:00]  and mom sits down and goes,  Me and your father, I want you to know,  and I want you to know it has nothing to do with you,  we're divorced.  Oh, okay.  Can I go out and play now?  How is this going to change my life?  Does this mean I don't have to listen to...  Oh, it does?  Okay.  So it's a good thing.  Great.  Well, thank you for staying together for so long,  and really, like, torturing us.  You couldn't have pulled this one, like, five years ago?  Yeah, fucking asshole!  Well, maybe we couldn't remember as much, 
[00:41:30]  and didn't have to listen to the yelling and screaming.  Don't wear your back!  Here's an idea, Pop.  There you go.  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp.  Give that a whirl.  The War of the Kuias.  It's got to be you're going to just sit there disgusted,  having to listen to this crap.  Here's Opie and Anthony, when they aren't stinking.  Who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, we're going to move on, 
[00:42:00]  because the stories are just not funny.  That wasn't a bad story I told.  At least I said it wasn't a funny story.  I didn't say...  Mike from Buffalo.  What's up, Mike?  You can't follow up the urine on the girl story.  I know.  I told him in the wrong order.  Let's go, Mike.  All right.  I need a good manly pep talk here,  because I'm feeling like a real pussy right now.  All right.  What happened?  Last night, keep in mind, the bars are open here until 4 a.m.  So just a little bit ago, I was out at the bars,  and I've been after this girl for like eight months,  and I'm totally head over heels for the chick.  She's super hot.  Just the nicest girl in the world the whole night. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, he's in love.  You'll never get her.  Listen to his voice, man.  You'll never get her.  That's not true.  You'll never get her.  Do you own a handgun, sir, and a passport?  Well, no.  Here's where it gets real shitty is tonight I got the friend speech.  Oh.  The dreaded friend speech.  And then following the dreaded friend speech is the  I like your upstairs neighbor speech.  Oh, you're just screwed.  So you're at the bar hoping that to,  well, first of all, you're at the bar probably thinking 
[00:43:00]  you're doing pretty well with the girl, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And is she really hot?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  What does she look like?  I'd say 5'3", about 105 pounds maybe.  Brunette, you know, real skinny,  the most perky little ass you've ever seen.  He's in love, man.  Oh, yeah.  But so, you know, this isn't the bad part yet.  You know, this is all the take, you know, with a grain of salt.  So I get home.  You know, my friend's giving me the whole  don't feel too down on yourself. 
[00:43:30]  You know, go in, drink your beer, put yourself to sleep,  wake up tomorrow, and then deal with it speech.  Uh-huh.  And as we're sitting there in the driveway,  the neighbor pulls up with the chick in the car.  He's like, go in the house and do yourself a favor, go in right now.  So I go in the house, and I'm sitting in the house,  and listening to them go upstairs, and now they're banging.  Oh, dude.  Oh, this is painful.  And you just got to sit there.  The girl of your dreams is just getting slammed.  By my upstairs neighbor, who now, mind you, 
[00:44:00]  has known for the past six months or so  that I've been dying to get with this chick.  Wow, that is rough.  What should I do?  Should I go take some, you know, revenge, or what should I do?  What kind of revenge?  He didn't do anything wrong.  He just banged.  Yeah, he didn't do anything wrong.  You sound like the type of guy that couldn't do any revenge.  No, not really.  You sound kind of submissive.  Yeah, you sound kind of submissive, kind of wimpy.  Yeah.  Do you know what I would do for revenge?  I mean, this might be too harsh.  I don't know if I can even get in trouble for suggesting this. 
[00:44:30]  But you ought to call his place really late at night,  when he answers, ask him if he has Prince Albert in a can.  And if he says yes, say, well, then you better let him out.  Yeah.  He doesn't own a bowling alley, does he?  No, no.  And ask if he has 10-pound balls, and then ask him how does he walk.  Oh, wow, that is rough.  How old a guy are you?  I'm 24.  24.  Yeah.  And she's 21, he's 29, so I'm upstairs.  She's 21, he's 29. 
[00:45:00]  How was his technique?  Was she moaning?  I didn't hear moaning, so I'm guessing not very good,  so maybe I spilled on something.  He was rocking back and forth with his hands over his ears going,  No!  No!  No!  It was kind of like when Private Pyle is screaming,  he was just laying on his back with his hands over his head like Joker.  Yeah, so basically I just sat here drinking a beer,  chain-smoking cigarettes, thinking, God, I feel like a pussy.  Well, when was the last time you got laid? 
[00:45:30]  Three weeks ago.  That's fine.  All right, you're doing okay then.  Well, it's nothing to brag about, though, that's for sure.  There's nothing you can do, though.  What are you going to do?  Big fatty.  Is this girl kind of a slut or what?  Well, she wasn't a slut, but, you know, my friends call her two names.  They have two names for her.  One is Jay Leno, and the second is Gargamel, so you do the math.  Wow, what's that for?  Wait, wait, the girl that you...  The girl that you like, they call Jay Leno?  No, no, no, no, the last girl I got.  The last girl you had sex with.  Yeah, that's what I want to clear up.  Jay Leno, and what's the other one? 
[00:46:00]  Gargamel from the Smurfs.  Oh, boy.  So she's got a big jaw.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  You got the Smurf, and then you got the other one, Finger Cuffs.  Well, that's not what we like.  Watching her walk up to the house the next time after my friends call her Jay Leno,  I just was sitting there just shaking my head like, oh, my God.  Hey, what do you say we go to bed together?  I'll give you a little oral sex.  But, you know, you turn the lights off.  It's all good, so...  Yeah, there you go.  I think you came across too desperate with the girl you wanted to bang. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, it sounds to me like that could have been the problem.  As soon as the girl smells desperation, it's over, Johnny.  It's all about the upstairs neighbor after that.  Yeah, because I bet you that guy was kind of hanging out, being cool, not playing his cards, you know, too much.  Want to come over to my house?  Bitch.  Yeah, hey, what are you doing, you know?  She gave me the whole, you know, I love you, but, you know, I don't see you as anything more than a friend.  And the whole time my head's just shrinking lower and lower going, God damn it, I suck.  Here's what you got to do.  Stop talking to her. 
[00:47:00]  It happens, dude.  It happens to all of us.  I just got blown off by a chick I liked.  The first girl I went out with that I liked in a while, and, of course, I don't get a call back.  So, whatever.  Just stop talking to her.  Enough.  Ignore her, and if you can, grab some girl in front of her and just touch her genitals at the bar.  Fox News Channel's got jail gone wild.  They got the two hottest chicks.  Why are you turning the channel?  Ben, what are you doing?  Aw, Ben.  Ben, what happened?  What the F is wrong with you?  It changes. 
[00:47:30]  Both channels change.  All right, look.  Look.  We're live right now, and I know on Fox News Channel, they're going to show that video over and over and over again.  Do yourself a favor and put it on in the background.  It's two jail girls, really hot.  Really hot.  And one's topless, and they're taking all their furniture and smashing the windows in their cell trying to get out.  That was really hot.  Very good.  Yes, Mike.  Yeah.  So, I'm a pussy.  Yeah, yeah, you sound it. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, well.  It happens.  No big deal.  Move on.  So, what should I do to not be a pussy?  Don't look so wanting.  Yeah, you seem very needy.  Don't look so wanting.  Girls smell that crap in there.  I mean, you know, I just want a hot chick, because that's so much to ask, you know, and I don't want to have to pay for it, like Norton, you know?  Dude, every guy wants a hot chick.  Put yourself in a hot, like, we all think, like, yeah, I can give her the special relationship.  I'll show her what a real relationship is like.  We want them to see our specialness.  But you know what?  They want a hot guy, and they should want that. 
[00:48:30]  So, just accept where you are, and you've got to pay for it.  That's why there's prostitution.  What do you think?  I want to pay for it?  No, no.  Do sit-ups or pay for it?  I would pay for it, had I had to.  Hold on, we've got to interrupt again, because they're showing the video of Boston.  I see a guy sitting on a fleet bank sign about 20 feet in the air.  And you wonder why the cops had to take care of business, and unfortunately, this girl died.  They're ripping trees down, 10 more square.  They're trying to yank a 20-foot tree out of the ground.  A tree out of the ground.  One guy's 20 feet up in the air on a fleet bank sign. 
[00:49:00]  What a bunch of animals.  What a bunch of animals.  I want to see the rioting footage from St. Louis.  You're just not going to see it.  You know, Yankee fans, we are not on a mile.  All right, Mike.  Come on.  Yeah?  I think you need to keep in touch with the show.  Yeah?  Yeah, we want to see your progress as the weeks go on.  How you work it.  Yeah, it doesn't sound like you have game, though, bro.  No, I don't.  That's my problem, you know?  The nicest guys, they always finish last, and it don't get any further back than me. 
[00:49:30]  Look, he's the nice guy.  Don't sell yourself as the nice guy.  Yeah, stop being the concerned friend, dude.  You want to scrap a lot.  And it doesn't work.  It never works out for you if you're the nice guy.  You know what the nice guy gets to see?  The nice guy gets to see all his friends bang all the girls that you love.  I don't know what the nice guy gets to see, but I sure know what he gets to hear.  Yeah.  So what did this other guy have that you didn't have?  Besides a 21-year-old mouth on his mule. 
[00:50:00]  Well, I just got to say you're the nicest guy in the world, so apparently, look.  You know, I don't think I look that bad, but apparently, you know.  Come on.  Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.  Look, look.  Is she out of your league?  Every guy knows where their place is.  So what did this guy have that you didn't?  Did he dress better?  Was he taller?  Does he work out?  He has the wrap.  Does he have a big, huge mule?  I didn't want to have to do this, but he is a seaman.  He's in the Navy.  Oh, the Navy?  Does he walk around in his uniform?  No.  Oh, yeah.  No, he doesn't. 
[00:50:30]  What?  He walks around in the uniform.  He's got a Harley.  Dicks do like the uniform.  The Navy uniform?  And he's got a Harley?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And what do you got?  A little bicycle?  Yeah.  What do you drive?  What's your mode of transportation?  He's got the Harley.  What do you got?  A Cavalier.  A Cavalier?  All right.  Wow.  That might be.  Yeah, the Harley or the Cavalier.  Yeah.  Very rare a chick will not choose the Cavalier.  That's usually a real pussy magnet. 
[00:51:00]  Navy guy, what do you wear?  No, I shouldn't even say that.  What do you do for a living?  Yeah, what do you do?  He's Navy.  Well, I work in a grocery store, but...  All right, so you drive a Cavalier and you work in a grocery store.  What's your job in the grocery store?  I work in the dairy department.  Yeah.  Nice.  That's good.  I actually make like, you know, over $25,000 a year.  I work for, you know, I got a decent place.  Shut up, Ben.  That's a lot of money in Buffalo.  Oh, my God.  He's in Buffalo, right.  That's like Trump's money in Buffalo. 
[00:51:30]  I say $25,000 a year and I'm single.  That's a lot of fucking money.  Maybe not for you guys.  All right.  Dude, it's not the money.  It's not about the cash.  It's not about the money.  It's going to have something to do with your personality.  Did you tell her that you work in a grocery store?  Oh, she knows, yeah.  Yeah, she knows.  Of course she knows.  That's why she's with the Harley guy.  Do you try to get on her good side by always checking her milk when you come over and telling  her how long it's good for?  Hey, let her get into the 10-item line even if she's got 12.  You don't care.  You're crazy like that.  You're working it, man. 
[00:52:00]  You're showing her some love.  He's Navy with a Harley.  You're a grocery guy with a Cavalier.  Now, how tall are you?  I'm 5'9".  5'9"?  How much do you weigh?  I weigh 160.  All right.  That's not bad.  He's about the same or what?  He's actually about two inches shorter, roughly probably about the same weight.  It's probably a military muscle, though.  She gets to listen to the Harley kick over.  And what sound can he give her?  Beep.  Beep.  I got a pretty loud exhaust. 
[00:52:30]  I don't know how many vibros are.  Yeah, because your muffler's broken on your Cavalier.  Oh, you'd know it.  Oh, this poor guy.  I'm feeling bad.  Yeah, I am, too.  You want to bang an almost 50-year-old virgin?  Hey, I've never had a virgin before or anyone older than me, actually.  We got another girl.  We call her David Letterman.  Maybe you can...  I think one way...  Got a receding hairline and a gap in her teeth.  I don't know.  Maybe you'll give me his free hour.  I'll fly to New York.  Speaking of the free hour, a lawyer lady down there in Washington squashed the idea. 
[00:53:00]  We can't give away our free hours?  You could say it.  Anthony and I are kind of a bunch of pussies because we've only been on the job a few weeks.  Yeah.  So we don't have a choice in this one.  But, yeah.  Why can't we give away our hour?  NYconfidential.com wants to give everyone on the show a fine lady of the night for an hour.  Eric visited that place yesterday.  Yep.  Really? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Sex Bagel got his hour?  Yeah.  I talked to Jason briefly the other day.  How was it?  I didn't go for the hour.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Drop something off.  Oh, sure.  Well, so did Jim.  He went there and dropped something off, too.  A big gooey load.  The what?  Turn it up.  Hold on.  I can't hear anything.  I bet you he's going to...  Oh, my God.  He's panicking.  I bet you he's freaking out.  All right.  Yes?  I couldn't hear a word you said in there.  What did you say?  All right.  This is Sex Bagel, everyone.  Yeah.  So you went to NY Confidential? 
[00:54:00]  I dropped off the air check, which was what we were required to do.  The guy freaked me out a little bit, and I left.  Freaked you out?  What, did he touch your leg?  No.  He's a nice guy, but he's really obsessed with the show, and he's like, did you talk to Jim?  We left him a bunch of voicemails.  We've got some girls he wants to meet.  Jim hasn't called us back yet.  I said, I haven't seen Jim today since the show.  Well, let him know.  Have him call.  Have him come down.  Okay, I'll tell him.  I'll tell him.  So you were there in this paradise of hot chicks. 
[00:54:30]  No, there was only one girl there.  Oh, okay.  There was only one girl.  They were doing construction and some other stuff.  There was a bunch of other things going along.  So the guy's talking to me, here, you want some scotch?  You want some this?  No, no, no.  They were filming a porno.  Could be.  So were you thinking about getting your free hour yesterday?  I can't do it.  I cannot bring myself to do it.  No?  To do what?  Remove your mule?  What can't you do?  That.  I can't do that.  Can't pay for it.  He's not paying for it.  I know.  It's free.  They're paying for it.  You eat it.  Eric, let's make believe your mom and dad are not listening to the radio show. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, okay.  Now would you do it?  Oh, is that Mr. and Mrs. Bagel have the radio?  Yeah, Mr. and Mrs. Sex Bagel have the XM radio.  Yes.  One thing I've learned early on in this business, Opie, that we call show,  you cannot think about who's listening to this program.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  I've had nightmares where I've had to go to family functions and dinners and stuff  where I know what I was talking about and I know they were listening. 
[00:55:30]  You know.  Repeat after me.  Oh, we did that just for the radio.  Right.  That's what you say.  You have to say that.  It was a gag.  It'll get you out of everything when you do this type of radio show.  We did it for the radio.  Right.  We are good actors.  That's what I do.  Of course that didn't happen.  Yes.  Talk to me when your father comes and looks you in the eye and says,  so your mother and I were listening yesterday and then you remember that yesterday you were  telling golden shower stories and your father says, your mother looked at me and said, 
[00:56:00]  he doesn't really do that, does he?  And I looked at her and said, no, you're just joking for the radio.  And then you and your father make eye contact and you both know that you're a piss drinker.  All right, when that happens, you understand embarrassment.  But you know what?  Who are you talking about, Jim?  Just speculating.  It could have happened.  Here's another.  People who shine will notice.  Here's another one I've used many times.  And 20 legs of lamb. 
[00:56:30]  Here's another one I've used many times.  She wasn't as hot as we made her out to be.  That's another one.  Of course not.  You lack urine, Doc?  It's our job to make them sound like the hottest girls in America.  That's true, too.  She actually wasn't that hot.  There, that's the line.  All right, we've got to teach you this stuff.  So why couldn't you do it?  Because, again, I don't know why you can't give the hour away just for companionship.  That's perfectly legal.  Well, you know how lawyers are.  Lawyer lady down there in Washington squashed me giving away my free hour from nyconfidential.com. 
[00:57:00]  I'd give it to this guy, Mike, from Buffalo, who's on the line still.  In a second.  I definitely could use it.  But, mm.  All right.  Yeah, I feel in the gutter right now.  I'm fucking drunk as a skunk because I came home, heard that, fucking just started pounding the beers.  How many times did they go at it?  It sounded like just once.  But, you know, I was trying not to pay too much attention, but it's hard not to, you know?  Did you hear the slurping of her greedy mouth on his Navy mule? 
[00:57:30]  No, I'm like, God damn it.  That's not a big deal.  Who cares if, that's why you said that he probably wasn't that good because you didn't hear any noise.  That was when he was, he was, he was in the back of her throat giving it to her really savage.  The whole time she's telling me the, the, I love you as a friend, but that's it, and I like this guy.  He, she's not looking straight at the ground.  Bro, just walk away.  In the face.  Just walk away.  You got to just turn, turn and walk away.  And walk away.  What did you say when she said that? 
[00:58:00]  Uh, well, you know, I, I've done everything I could for you for the past eight months.  I've let you, you know, done everything I could, and you meet this guy.  I tried the best I could, and he waltzes in and one day fucking sweeps you off your feet at what, you know,  after eight months, you know, you never looked at me like that.  Holy S, you worked this chick for eight months, and the guy got her after one day?  Yep.  Oh, dude.  Oh, you are a sap.  Oh, my God.  Really, we can't help you.  I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking to our conversations on the phone every day. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, you're that guy.  Did she tell you problems?  You came across two desperate girls, smell that crap a mile away.  Hey, uh, Mike, did she tell you her problems, and you helped her, like, solve some of them?  Uh, no comment.  Oh, God, yeah.  And did you give her this one?  Hey, look, if you ever need to talk.  Do you ever need to talk?  I'm here for you.  Oh, repugnant.  Oh, you're just another chick to her.  You're just like a friend.  I don't want to be a chick.  What can I do different?  What should I do?  It's too late.  You're past the point of no return. 
[00:59:00]  Yes, she already knows you're a pussy.  She already knows you're a pussy.  Just learn from it and stop acknowledging her and just move on.  You'll meet some other nice girl who's purchasing eggs or something else in the dairy area.  Right.  Dairy.  So, for the next girl, what should I do different than I did with this one?  Don't be so desperate, and don't try to be her friend.  You try to be exactly what she made you.  Her friend.  Dude, do you know any dealers in Buffalo?  I'll give you some advice. 
[00:59:30]  Dealers?  Do you know any dealers in Buffalo?  No, what are we talking about?  You can suggest roofies?  Get a big bag of Coke.  Well, see, that's the funny part.  She actually was quite into that for a while.  Well, there you go.  The Navy guy probably had some good Coke.  Get a big bag of Coke.  It's better known as whore bait, and you'll be getting laid like crazy.  Wait, were you trying to talk her out of doing the Coke?  No comment.  Oh, yeah, you were probably like the good guy.  Hey, you've got to take care of yourself and settle down.  Don't get me wrong. 
[01:00:00]  I love partying, but she was a little overboard.  Meanwhile, the Navy guy is doing lines off her tits.  Oh, of course.  He's giving her a mouthful of throat yogurt, and you're over there pricing eggs, telling  her to be a good girl.  She's grinding her teeth on all fours, and she's just getting it from behind.  He's got a rail of Coke that goes from her breasts all the way down to her patch, and  he ain't stopping.  Dude, you said you like to party.  Let me hear a night out with Mike. 
[01:00:30]  Budweiser and some D&D with my friends.  If I know of Buffalo, I think it's a few beers and a few shots of Jägermeister, right?  That's about it.  Oh, yeah.  The Jäger bombs, actually.  Jäger bombs.  Chicken wings.  The Red Bull and the Jäger.  Wow, watch out.  Mike's getting crazy.  Yeah.  I'm going to go first game right now.  All right, dude, listen.  Listen.  Can I ask a question before you?  She is so out of your league.  You have to go to a preppy bar where the girls sip their little beers.  You'll be better off.  I don't think you're ready for a Coke whore.  No.  Are you ready to really make fun of me now? 
[01:01:00]  Why, Mike?  Last week, she was in the hospital.  She was in the ICU for four days.  You want to guess who was sitting by her bedside the whole time?  Oh, yes.  Dude.  What was wrong with her?  Yeah, what was wrong with her?  Uh, she had an asthma attack.  Oh, I thought it was her latest abortion.  Jesus, dude.  You sat by her bedside.  Oh, yeah.  Did you read to her?  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Did you say, I'll always be there to catch you?  The worst part is I even got a parking ticket because I parked in the wrong spot.  Dude, you are the worst.  Were you standing over her as she opened her eyes for the first time and saw you and went,  Hey, pumpkin.  I'm here for you.  Squeeze her hand.  And she said, I want you to do one thing for me.  And you said, what?  And she said, win.  And you said, win what?  And she said, the pricing competition in the dairy department, you zilch. 
[01:02:00]  Now beat it.  Get out of my hospital room and bring me some military dick.  Oh, can you go score me some coke?  I've been in here four days and I'm jonesing.  Jesus, dude.  What the freak?  Oh, holy ass.  You are a true zilch.  You're a sap.  We were with you for a while, too, man.  You poor guy.  I feel for him, though.  Of course.  Every guy's done that.  We've all done something like this in some stupid way. 
[01:02:30]  But, you know, by 24, you'd think you'd learn.  You know, this is kind of 16 through 18 you do this stuff.  You know?  You do anything for that girl that just isn't going to be yours.  And you look at her every day and you want her and it's a horrible feeling.  And you've got to look at the guy she's with and it's just awful.  Oh, waiting by her hospital bed.  That's classic Lifetime movie shit. 
[01:03:00]  The last chick I was head over heels for, she was about to leave her dude for me.  And then she told me she was pregnant with this kid.  Oh, man.  Wow.  You're just a mess.  You've got to look at a different class of girl.  You're just a mess.  Isn't there a nice girl you can meet over, like, in meets or housewares or something like that?  Unfortunately, I just work overnight.  It's a bunch of weird people.  Now, you're out of your league.  I mean, you should start striking up conversations with the cashiers at the supermarket.  You've got to settle down. 
[01:03:30]  The thing is, they're all under age.  Settle down.  We've got this nifty stoplight system where if the girl's 15, she wears red.  If she's yellow, she's 16 or 17.  If she's 18 or above, she wears gray.  And almost all the cashiers are yellow.  And believe me, some of them you look at, you're like, oh, check that out.  What do you mean they're Asian, sir?  Let's say hi to Tony in Cincinnati.  He wants to help out Mike in Buffalo.  Go ahead, Tony.  Tony.  You fall asleep on us, Tony.  I hope that's working. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  He had advice for you, but I guess he's out.  Hey, I'll take all the advice I can get.  Trust me.  I think we gave you enough.  Let me try this one more time.  Tony?  No.  I wonder if we could do that today.  All right, Mike.  I guess we've got to let you go.  Well, I'll keep in touch and let you know the sad story of Mike.  Please do, White Earl.  Hold on.  Try it now, they're saying.  Hold on.  Let's give it one more shot.  All right.  Tony in Cincinnati.  Tony?  No.  No.  Maybe there's a...  Hey, story of my life. 
[01:04:30]  I get nothing, sir.  Tony?  No.  No.  I hope we can conference people today.  Hold on.  I've got to test this out.  We're trying to figure the system out, sir.  Oswald in Jersey saying, tell Mike the only way to get the hot chick.  Tony in Boston.  The only way to get her back is to kill yourself.  That'll show her.  All right.  We've got Jaime in the studio.  It's his fresh haircut.  Today's...  Very collegiate.  Should I try it again?  Try it again?  No, I know.  I did it that way. 
[01:05:00]  Tony in Cincinnati.  What's up?  Yeah, I got some advice for that dude.  Look at Jaime just fixing things.  Jaime can run in, push a button, and it's fixed.  I love it.  You have to move here.  He walks in, these stupid DJs.  That's right.  All right, go ahead, Tony.  You got some advice for Mike in Buffalo?  Yeah, you just got to let it go.  You got to get something in your own league, go ahead and marry it, make a couple of kids,  buy the Honda, pay for the groceries, keep your head down, and after 10 years, you're  like, not even looking both ways when you cross the fucking street. 
[01:05:30]  I love this guy.  Yeah.  Should I just walk out there now and just save myself the trouble?  Yeah.  That's pretty much what you have to look forward to, is Tony's life in Cincinnati.  That's what the nice guy shit will get you, I'm telling you.  You got to get the next one.  Just give up on this one.  Go to the next one and treat her like an absolute whore.  That's what they want.  Well, what pisses me off is the girls, they always say, you know, I want to be treated  like a princess.  You know, where's my Prince Charming?  And then they got a guy like that, and they're just like, fuck it, I'm going to go with the 
[01:06:00]  asshole who treats me like shit.  You know, I don't get it.  That's the way.  They want to be treated by a princess by, sir?  Yeah?  They want to be treated by a princess by a guy that doesn't have to treat them like a princess.  Do you understand what I mean?  They don't want to be treated by a guy like a princess who's just lucky to have them in  her presence.  You understand what I'm saying?  She knows you're going to treat her like a princess, but this Navy guy, she figures  will blow her off and treat her like shit, so when he's nice to her, it's a pleasant  surprise.  Ooh, very good.  Yeah.  That's fucked up. 
[01:06:30]  It's true.  That's fucked up.  Well, I ain't saying it ain't true, I'm just saying it's fucked up, you know?  Oh, and she will be calling you when this Navy guy, you know, blows her off.  Yeah, well, the next time she's in the hospital with a Coke overdose, you'll be sitting  there holding her stupid hand with a little name on the wristband.  You'll be there thinking you got a shot again.  Yeah.  Bedside.  That's such a sorry excuse for a male, I'll probably answer the phone, too.  I'll be there for you as she walks in because her legs are sore from being banged so well  all night.  You know, Mike, I do...  You need a pillow? 
[01:07:00]  I'll get you a pillow.  I do have to say, Mike, you're not alone.  There's so many guys that have done this.  Oh, of course.  All of us.  Any guy that says this never happened to him at some point is lying.  Joe from Jersey.  Joey.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think we're done with this.  All right, Mike.  Poor guy.  You check in from time to time, okay?  All right.  I'll call and keep you posted.  Bye, Mike.  Hey, if they have morning sex, could you give us a call back?  I'll put the phone up to the door.  We can hear what she sounds like.  Yeah, is he still upstairs? 
[01:07:30]  I think so.  No, you know so, with the Harleys parked right outside there.  You see it.  You see it as you're on the phone.  Wait a minute, Norton.  That damn Harley.  That's your problem, is that Harley.  You go out there and slash the tires now.  Norton, I'm telling you something here.  You know, you hear me?  I have a question for you first, though, before you go.  What?  Do you...  Can you...  How long after you price the milk, how long is it actually good for?  Like, if it says October 1st, how long is that for real good for?  If it's actually kept under refrigeration, they tell us five days. 
[01:08:00]  Okay, so they are kind of giving you a little lead time to finish up that milk.  Yeah, that's under perfect temperature, though, of course.  So what do you think is going to happen with this girl?  Uh, she's going to call...  Rejected him just like she did.  Wow.  That poor guy.  Because your mom still buys your underpin.  Turn down your TV.  Opie and Anthony.  Good morning, little booper.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck. 
[01:08:30]  Good for what ails you, what what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Let's get an update from Mike in Buffalo.  Yes, Mike.  Oh, what a weekend.  What a weekend.  Oh, yeah?  What happened?  Well, starters, after I talked to you guys that day, I'm hanging out.  We got a little bar in our basement, you know, where we got our TV and DVDs and all that stuff.  Yeah.  I'm hanging out down here feeling sorry for myself.  And after he goes to work, she stays up at his place and comes down here and proceeds to ask me, you know, what's wrong?  How am I doing?  And I'm like, you know, how the hell do you think I'm doing?  You know, this sucks. 
[01:09:00]  She goes, what sucks?  I go, that the girl I like is upstairs, spends the night with my neighbor, and then comes down here and asks me how's my day going?  Confrontation.  Nice.  Yeah, and she's like, oh, oh.  And then, you know, an awkward couple minutes, and then she goes back upstairs, and I'd say probably since Friday morning, she's probably called me ten times wanting to hang out.  That's awful.  Wanting to hang out.  Here's what that was.  That was, he played the sad sack role.  Yeah.  How you doing?  And she probably didn't catch on for like 40 minutes, and he kept kicking around, and he would like hold the razor and spin it in his fingers. 
[01:09:30]  What's wrong?  And then he went into that thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, I'm sure you're a nice guy, but you've got to realize this guy's entertaining her upstairs with tales of being on the USS Cole when it blew out, and you're sitting there going, do you believe that milk went up?  She's got to bang the military guy.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're done.  She's just being nice.  She's being because you're her friend.  Yeah, it's like she keeps flouting it in my face, though.  It sucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm leaving to go to work and seeing her car parked outside. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, so he banged her well.  She came back for more.  Oh, yeah.  She's staying the night and everything.  Yeah.  Wow.  That sucks.  It's over.  You know, you did exactly what we told you not to do.  She's going to work with jizz in her hair because she doesn't have time to shower.  It's kind of hard to say, you know, to not see her when she comes down where you hang out and, you know, start talking to you.  You know, it's hard to ignore her.  He played the sad sack.  I know he did.  We told you not to.  God.  How you doing?  I'm all right.  No, I'm okay. 
[01:10:30]  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  You know, but seeing you, the girl I like, upstairs with, oh, and then she's like, oh, I feel so bad because you're such a good friend.  That way I'll, now, what should I do?  I should call and maybe spend a little more time with my good friend.  She's like, this is what she thought.  Oh, shit.  There goes my ride to the airport.  Yeah.  All right.  Let me call him.  What are you doing?  In between getting banged really well, I'll call him.  That's what I'll do.  Dude, and we're not even knocking you a little bit, maybe.  You've got to stop with this chick.  Let her go. 
[01:11:00]  I know it's hard because she's banging the stud upstairs and you're downstairs with an apron going, putting little price stickers on apples.  I understand it's frustrating.  And I know he can't do the things you can do.  Like, by golly, if cheese goes bad, who's going to tell her?  Right.  Not him.  You know, throughout this weekend, I was tempted to call up the Jay Leno chick again.  And, you know, but after the way, the reason I'm not banging her anymore, you guys will find this funny.  You know, we were getting together and I figured, you know, I'll be a nice guy, you know, hoping for something in return. 
[01:11:30]  And I figure I'll go down on her, right?  Yeah.  So I'm going down there taking care of some business.  And, you know, that's one of the things I can do.  Business.  He's like filing his taxes.  He's bragging, though.  That's one thing you could do well, you said?  Oh, yeah.  Like that, I'm pro at.  So, you know, I'm going down.  I feel I'll make her good.  And then still, you know, return a little later.  He's a pro at that.  So he says.  Wow.  His tongue works like a little, like a little, like a little, like a little, ah!  Aw.  Better than mine does.  There you go.  Improv skills.  Go ahead, man.  I'm sorry I interrupted you with my lack of gift. 
[01:12:00]  He's good at the, ah, he's good at the, ah, down below stuff.  Yeah.  All right.  So I'm going down, you know, hoping for a little in return, you know?  And all of a sudden, ah, I didn't, you know, really check first.  And that was my first mistake, you know?  I just kind of went down there.  And I'm doing what I got to do.  No recon.  You got to recon, man.  You got to recon the area with a quick visual.  Oh, my God.  Are you insane?  Quick visual before you go there.  And a quick swipe of the finger, and then you, a quick one, and then you grab the breast,  and as you're kissing the nip, you go, you smell your finger.  That's the oldest guy trick in the book.  We go, we go right from that area. 
[01:12:30]  You take a little swipe with your finger, and then you grab the breast, and your finger's  right there.  I think women know we're doing it, but they got to respect that we're checking.  I like taking a little pH tester and dipping it in there and seeing if it comes up acid or  base.  That's how I check.  See what color it turns.  Sure.  Hey, it's a light green.  Looks good today.  Just put it right on your fingernail.  You don't want to eat yellow.  See if your fingernail turns yellow.  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  So why should you have checked first, sir?  Well, so I'm down there.  I'm doing what I got to do, and all of a sudden, I stick the finger in to make it, you know, 
[01:13:00]  that little extra bit better.  And I'm like, what is that?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  A tamp?  Oh, yeah.  Ah.  Not just a tampon.  No?  It wasn't where it was supposed to be.  It was up there.  Like, way up there.  Right.  You know why it was way up there?  The guy that was with her before you jammed it up there.  You pushed it in.  You loser.  Ah.  It wouldn't have been so bad if she was still on the rag.  It was done with.  It was up there and forgotten about. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, stop it.  Because it was jammed up there.  Where did God?  I go, I stop, and I'm just like, real awkward.  I don't know what the fuck to do.  You know, is that what I think that is?  That's got to be what I think that is.  I go to her.  Is that what I think that is?  And she goes, what?  Like, she had no clue what I was talking about.  You sure it wasn't an IUD or something that she put in because she knew you were having sex?  Oh, no.  A sponge?  Something?  Yeah.  Because, you know, I left a finger in, like, feeling.  Is that what I think that is?  You don't seem very knowledgeable. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  He doesn't seem very knowledgeable.  I don't know.  There could have been some form of birth control device because she came over knowing she's  going to have sex with you.  Well, when I brought that up, she's like, oh, no, I don't think I forgot to take that  out.  And then she, you know, it's like, oh.  Didn't you feel a string or something?  You are a zero.  You really are the worst.  You are really awful.  You're just.  You are a sad sack.  We don't even want to waste time on you anymore. 
[01:14:30]  I got to hear the rest.  So what happened while you were performing oral treats on Leno?  What happened?  Well, you know, I stopped as soon as I realized what was going on.  And I'm like, oh, I just felt vile.  I felt like I was violated.  Like, it was the dirtiest thing that ever happened to me in my entire life.  And.  Well, how do you think she felt having the guy from the dairy department go down on her?  She was aiming for the guy in meats or the guy in canned goods.  But no, she had to settle on the guy.  I'm just kidding you, man.  I feel guilty. 
[01:15:00]  I can't even.  She leaves, just horrified it.  And, you know, basically text messages me.  I'm sorry.  I've never had anything happen like that to me before that.  That was so embarrassing.  And I was just like, yeah, I can't go there again.  You will.  Dude, do you have like a toaster and a bathtub?  Uh, yeah, I do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do the math.  Yeah, you're kind of a sad, sad sack.  We got the new Frenchie on the line here.  Andre.  Oh, no.  Henri.  Henri.  Oh, hold on.  Oh, don't worry.  Oh, just a little button push away. 
[01:15:30]  Hold on.  Okay.  You got it, Oh?  Yes, he does.  Yes, I do.  Henri.  Henri.  Did you lose the faggot?  No.  Mike from Buffalo is still on the line with the new Frenchie.  Mike's a good guy.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  It doesn't mean I'm a faggot.  Ooh.  Okay.  I just tuned in.  Did he kiss the girl that fucked the Navy guy or did he make out with her?  He still wants to?  No, he's still pining away for the girl that's getting banged really, really good and hard  by the Navy guy.  Hey, Mike.  Yeah?  Can you hear me? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  You want to kiss this girl, no?  You want to put your tongue down her throat?  Well, I don't really want to taste the Navy dick either.  Taste the Navy cock in your mouth and taste the Navy balls.  You should suck the Navy guy's dick.  It'd be easier for you.  No?  Yeah.  I guess.  I guess for him, you know.  That's the only way you're going to taste her.  Oh, stole my line, you fucking prick.  Anyway.  Yeah, like we couldn't see where all this was going a mile away.  You want to kiss her?  Hey, you want to put your tongue in the mouth of the girl with the Navy guy? 
[01:16:30]  Okay, get ready.  Here it comes.  Regular Maginot line of jokes he's got going there.  This guy's sitting here pining for this girl.  I want to make fun of him.  Why?  I called to make fun of him.  Okay?  And I beat you to it.  Yeah, he kind of diffused you're making fun because we saw the setup coming like a bunch  of Nazis blitzkrieging their way across your country.  Son of a bitch.  He makes fun of himself.  Don't worry about it.  He works in the dairy.  I said Ray Charles could have seen that joke coming. 
[01:17:00]  What did you say?  I said Ray Charles could have seen that joke coming.  Oh, that's kind of good.  And he's blind and dead.  Oh, okay.  At least I get laid.  That's okay.  Ooh.  At least I get laid by the girls I want.  This guy sits and cries for a girl who treats him like shit.  That's the funniest part.  How long before Henri is just going, shut up, fag?  I know.  I'll never do that.  Leave me.  I will never do that.  I've proved myself many times so far.  All right.  All right, Henri.  We've got to move on.  Okay. 
[01:17:30]  Trying to spend less time with the boring callers here.  Bonjour.  Mike, I think we're, I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you anymore.  You're still a pathetic guy, Mike.  It's good to know you're still a pathetic guy, though.  Yeah.  I want Mike to stay in touch.  Yeah, stay in touch.  I will.  I'll call you next time I got to.  Clean up your life like you would clean up a broken ketchup bottle on aisle three.  Pretend your life is a spill.  Right.  Just get to mopping it up.  Grab that big supermarket mop and just mop up your problems.  Sorry, excuse for a man.  Aisle five. 
[01:18:00]  All right.  Very good.  Very good.  You're kind of funny, though.  All right, Mike.  Not bad.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  See you, Mike.  Coopie and Anthony.  XM 202.  You guys want a Mike the Pussy update?  Mike the Pussy from Buffalo.  Remember Buffalo?  Oh, yeah.  We got a lot of new listeners.  Mike hasn't called in weeks.  Mike was head over heels in love with a girl that he had a friendly relationship with.  Look.  He had fallen into the friend zone, and he wanted to take it further.  She obviously didn't. 
[01:18:30]  And what happens?  She winds up going with his roommate or housemate, the downstairs neighbor.  Upstairs.  Upstairs.  Upstairs.  The upstairs neighbor.  The Marine guy, right?  Yep.  Marine.  Motorcycle.  Harley, yeah, yeah.  And this guy spent time with her when she went to the hospital, and he did all those  things that these saps think are going to get you into bed with the girl.  Meanwhile, you're just more and more the friend, the person she counts on to do things for  her while she's banging other guys.  And this guy, heartbroken, a real sap, and we gave him the business. 
[01:19:00]  His job?  His job is in a supermarket in the produce section, I believe.  I thought it was dairy, but I could be wrong.  Could be dairy, right.  It was dairy.  Pricing the milk.  Is that...  You're all right with that, or you want to have to read from Rent Boys, you sick ass?  Oh, geez, why?  Because I got the wrong aisle in the supermarket?  No, no, I don't.  All right.  Now, believe me, when Ant reads from Rent Boy, he's going to read from Rent Boy.  That'll never happen, by the way.  He'll read.  He doesn't care.  Yeah, right.  And I love it.  Rent Boy.  You just wait. 
[01:19:30]  All right, so let's get the update from Mike.  Let's hear what's new from Mike.  Mikey.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, Mike.  What's the latest with Mike the Pussy?  Oh, well, I figured I'd call and give you guys a little update.  It's been a little while.  With the girl who I was after, I basically gave up on that.  Wow, what a guy.  Good.  About time.  Yeah, basically, you know, she still calls every once in a while, but I don't really  give her much of the time of day.  Yeah.  You showed her.  Good man.  She still railing the other guy? 
[01:20:00]  No, actually, that stopped.  Oh, why?  Trouble in paradise?  Why didn't you tell me he was an asshole?  And I was like, well, I wouldn't have believed you if you did.  You know, it's...  Oh, she...  I guess the guy is an asshole.  Yeah, so she found out.  And she found out.  She started to realize that.  Mm-hmm.  And she came right back to you to say, why didn't you tell me?  Yeah, and I was like, well, you wouldn't have believed me if I did.  You know, she was...  How many loads did you think she took before she realized the guy was an asshole?  I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  I don't know, but the reason I was calling back is to tell you about what happened to  me last night.  Okay.  You were pricing quartz...  And?  ...of skim.  No, no.  Not last night.  Okay.  But, you know, I did end up doing what Noren said and go back and fuck Jay Leno again.  Oh, the chin girl.  Yeah, he's got this girl that he can screw when he wants to that looks like Jay Leno.  We forgot to mention that.  And he says he is really, really good at eating snatch.  Yeah, but the problem was...  But we don't believe it. 
[01:21:00]  She had, like, a tampon stuck up in her or something?  Yeah, yeah.  See?  I did cave and go back to that.  I didn't go back to the heart transplant, girl, though.  No, right, right.  That was good.  Well, I forgot about the heart transplant, girl.  I forgot about her, too.  Yeah, yeah.  This guy is really pathetic.  Hey, dude, how would you feel about banging someone who took a boat to the back of the skull?  If it was a girl, maybe, you know, but...  Ah, just close your eyes.  Yeah.  Yeah, he won't notice.  Right.  Yeah, probably.  All right.  So, anyways, there's this girl at work who I ended up banging last night. 
[01:21:30]  Ooh.  Yeah.  At work at the supermarket?  No, I know.  This was home on my day off, so...  No, but she works with you at the supermarket?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What does she do?  Man, she must be a real treat.  Yeah, she works in the grocery.  I work in the dairy.  Ooh.  What does she do?  What does she do?  Ah, just stocking and stuff.  Ah, little glances at each other over the cereal section.  Sure.  Sure.  Does she talk dirty and say, fuck me like it's the expiration date?  No, no. 
[01:22:00]  Not like that.  Oh, baby.  Open up.  Here comes some curdled milk.  No.  Did she grab your junk and squeeze it and go, price check on this cock?  Yeah, put it in aisle one, in aisle two, in aisle three.  Clean up in aisle seven.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  That's funny.  So she's 29, probably about 5'7 or so.  She's how old?  29.  29, okay.  And how old are you again?  24, almost 25. 
[01:22:30]  She's 29, still working at the grocery store.  This can't be that good.  Yeah, she just got out of a marriage for like six or eight years, so she just wanted some  non-committing screwing around.  There you go.  How much does she weigh?  Yeah.  About 110.  Oh, cool.  All right.  All right.  And what does she look like?  Any good?  Well, that's where it gets interesting.  Her face is a little messed up.  Her body's great.  Lots of tattoos.  Oh, she's a butter face.  Lots of tats.  Well, this is the reason I called back. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, okay.  We're not done yet.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  Because, you know, she's always got to be attached.  Yeah.  And, well, I was banging her last night, and she kind of shocked me a little when she  took out her teeth and proceeded to give me the best blowjob I've ever received in  my life.  Wow.  The toothless one.  You know what?  That's just awful.  I got a toothless.  I don't care how good the BJ was.  The toothless thing is just not happening, man, ever. 
[01:23:30]  The only time, there's no, it's disgusting, and it would remind me of a baby or an old  person.  There's no reason to have a girl take her teeth out, ever.  Yeah.  All of those choices are really hot, Jim.  Well, I was thinking both, but apparently, picky, picky.  Just should put the lips over the teeth, and that's that.  Charles Brunson face.  You must make a face like Charles Brunson and cover the teeth.  If I had any game, you know, I'd probably have that same attitude, but, you know, me,  I'm not arguing, I'll take what I can get kind of thing, you know? 
[01:24:00]  All right.  Well, Mike, we're going to cut you short today.  It's good to hear that you're still a pussy in Buffalo, New York there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  At least he's getting some.  I kind of respect that.  Isn't that great?  He's getting a toothless...  Divorcee.  ...supermarket divorcee.  Divorcee, yeah.  Good job.  Excellent.  All right.  Yeah, take it down.  All right.  All right, there he goes.  It's an independent film.  Our buddy Blind Dave from Connecticut is checking in.  Hey, Blind Dave, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  What do you got today, buddy?  I just want to...  Hey, Mike, thank you. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, he's gone.  Oh, he's gone.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted to say thanks to him.  He could make self-help tapes.  Really?  Yeah, because I'm going to feel great about myself all day.  Blind Dave is mocking Mike.  Oh, my God.  Blind Dave feels better about himself when Mike calls.  Yeah, because I haven't sunk that low yet, so...  Yeah, but you have a girlfriend and stuff, don't you?  Yeah, but it gets old after a while.  No way.  I haven't had any strange.  Isn't everything strange to you? 
[01:25:00]  Right.  You can't see her.  Well, never mind.  Yeah, how are you going to...  What she's got to do is change perfumes.  That's a great point, Anthony.  I don't have to role-play, because she's whoever I imagine her to be.  Right.  All right, punch it out, guys.  He knows where to punch it out.  Bye, Dave.  That's why we love Dave.  He knows he doesn't have much today, so he just said, all right, that's it.  He just said that because he knows it takes him ten minutes to hang the phone up.  Yeah, he's still bumping around the night table.  Early.  First one.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:25:30]  The Fat Girls.  Please let me meet you.  I have huge tips.  Just love you.  It's a freak show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Say, Jim, nice meals.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  There's some sexual reference.  Well, we got Erica in the studio.  Hello.  It's Couch Lady.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  So what's the deal?  You were supposed to be here last week with the couch?  Yes, and unfortunately, I had a little...  What?  Incident?  Oh.  Infection?  No.  In what? 
[01:26:00]  I don't know.  I guess I had anxiety last week.  Oh, you had an anxiety attack?  I had an anxiety attack and my...  Is that why our porn stars had to have lesbian sex on a piece of fiberglass?  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  So I was going to wake up really early in the morning and...  Wait, are you the same girl that was just sitting out there?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just wondering.  Because there's other girls that have been walking through.  I guess he was a little confused.  There's another girl sitting next to me that's blonde.  Oh, okay.  I told you there's a bunch of people out there now.  Oh. 
[01:26:30]  I get you.  Yeah.  What's your name?  Erica.  Erica.  So you own a furniture store?  Well, we had an antique consignment shop for home furnishings and we had a bunch of stuff  that we had.  But you were the same girl sitting right there.  Yeah.  I told you.  Huh.  Are you married?  No.  Oh, nice.  I don't know.  She's getting married.  Oh, not nice.  Could you tell us more about the furniture store?  It's closed.  I thought it would make a good addition to the book guy we just listened to.  No, it's... 
[01:27:00]  Why did it close down?  Economy's not good.  No.  And you oversleep a lot?  Pretty much going down the crapper, so...  Yeah.  And I what?  And you oversleep a lot.  I heard you had a problem last week.  I heard you gave me something for anxiety.  Hey, come get back on mic.  Knocked me out cold and I just did not wake up.  Really?  Wait, who gave you this medicine?  My doctor.  Right.  And so you had some anxiety and he gave you something?  Yeah.  To make you sleep?  Yeah.  He goes, here, take one of these.  I'm like, good.  What were you anxious about?  I don't...  I...  Well, things and...  Yeah?  Just...  Just things.  Whatever, and I took one and knocked me out cold for like 12 hours straight and I... 
[01:27:30]  Same girl, huh?  It worked.  You weren't anxious for 12 hours.  Yeah, exactly.  There's something about this glass.  Kind of works, is what I'm thinking.  Oh, the couch is coming.  Oh, here comes the lesbian couch that Erica brought in.  We're having a ceremony.  Do we have any, you know, music that we could play?  We should have thought ahead of time.  Lesbian couch music, Opie.  A little Katie Lang.  What do you want, a polka?  I think there's like a heart filter on that glass or something.  I'm going to...  A what?  Like, you know, in the heart videos. 
[01:28:00]  Ugh.  All right, where's the couch?  Very nice.  Jim's on the lesbian couch.  You bet I am.  You want to explain what the lesbian couch is for the people at home?  You're the expert on couches.  It's just a love seat, probably from the 80s.  Yes, it is a love seat.  From the late 80s.  Late 80s?  Late, late 80s.  Only the best for your pals, Opie and Anthony.  Early, I don't know exactly what year.  Any stains on it?  No, it's clean.  It's clean.  Where was it all this time?  Yeah, where was it for 20 years? 
[01:28:30]  Come on, tell the truth.  If it doesn't sell in the store after so long, we take ownership of it, and it's out in the warehouse for a little while.  It goes to the warehouse for half an hour.  Oh, we got...  If it doesn't sell...  We got the blacklight.  We're going to make sure this is a...  Ooh.  Well, you need an extension cord, guys.  I don't think it's going to reach...  Sorry, not as good as through the mirror, Opie?  Is that what you're trying to say?  No, I didn't say that, really.  Yeah, you're trying to say it.  You can say it.  I don't know.  Like, you just looked different when you were sitting out there.  That's all.  What are you saying?  She's lovely.  I know she's lovely. 
[01:29:00]  Stop trying to cause trouble.  Norton's causing trouble.  I'm not at all.  I'm trying to sit on the couch and look at her hiney.  You have a nice hiney.  Oh.  She goes, oh.  Do you have an extension cord?  Are we going to check it with the blacklight?  Yeah, we're going to check it with the blacklight.  All right, we're plugging in the blacklight.  I want to see if anybody's been having any hanky-panky.  No idea who owned it prior to...  I have no idea.  Oh, yeah, no idea.  It's probably a homicide committed on this couch at 86.  I could only dream.  Turn off the lights.  Ooh.  This will definitely make this more gooder. 
[01:29:30]  It's light out.  We have to get some curtains, by the way, for them stupid...  We don't need the blacklight.  Matt, it's curtains for you.  I asked you guys what you wanted.  I could have brought curtains.  No, the couch is fine.  Yeah, the couch is fine.  A post-1981 couch?  I have no idea what year it's from.  It does look kind of 80.  All right, let's turn on the blacklight.  Here we go.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's fine.  It'll serve the purpose.  Yeah, for a bunch of dykes.  Don't blacklight the girl.  Blacklight the couch.  Oh, boy.  Can you turn it on?  What are you doing? 
[01:30:00]  Why doesn't anything work on this show, ever?  Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Danny, get that blacklight working.  That's the important thing.  All right, now we're trying to figure out how to turn on the blacklight.  Come over here.  I'll fill out your card.  Wow, this show is just going downhill in a hurry.  No.  We can't figure out the blacklight.  It's fine.  Danny, what's wrong with the blacklight?  I don't know.  It's not turning on.  Danny.  Danny.  Sorry.  Calm down.  Danny.  It'll be okay.  I tested it before I brought it in to make sure that it worked before I brought it here. 
[01:30:30]  Perhaps the extension cord is bad.  It's been laying in the booth.  Plug it directly into the wall and see if it works.  Perhaps the socket is bad.  There you go.  There's plenty of things that...  All right, we got the blacklight on.  It's the extension cord.  It's the extension cord.  Everyone calm down.  All right, pull the couch over and give it a once-over.  How do you know if there's a load on there?  What do you see?  You'll see white.  Oh, my God.  Is that X-Files music?  Very good.  All right, we're checking the lesbian couch for splooge marks.  So far, so good, right?  Anything?  We're getting a thumbs up.  Oh, they're pointing out something, Steve? 
[01:31:00]  Eric?  Jim?  Yeah.  And on the armrest would be where you would bend a girl over and bang her.  All right, Steve, absolutely.  What are you seeing?  Big white stain right on me.  Get out of here.  Let me see.  I'm not lying.  Take a look.  Uh-oh.  What does it look like, Mulder?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You would absolutely use that part of the couch, too.  You would bend her over that.  That's a definite load right there, a dried-up load.  That light detects semen.  Oh, there's another one.  There's something going on over there where your upper back would rest on the back of the 
[01:31:30]  couch there, Anthony.  All right.  What is that?  Is that urine?  Oh, that's just the design.  No, what is that?  Is that the pattern of the couch?  It is now.  All right.  That's what...  I don't know, man.  Is that the pattern of the couch, or is this just splattered?  Sploge stain.  Sploge.  Oh, what about that stain?  That's the pattern.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  I see the pattern.  The pattern is called jizz stain.  It was very popular in the early 80s. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, there's another one.  Oh, is that a big stain right there?  What do you think?  Wait a minute.  Maybe that's just the pattern, too.  I think we have a relatively clean lesbian couch in there.  I think so, too.  There's one or two spots on it, but...  Well, I don't know.  Let's go back to the stain on the right armrest.  There's leaves in it?  There's leaves in the couch, Anthony.  Yes.  I aired it out yesterday.  What?  What?  I aired it out yesterday, and the leaves...  Outside, and the leaves fell...  Yes.  All right.  She aired it out.  Thanks.  Wow. 
[01:32:30]  Look at that.  A condom.  No.  All right.  I think we're pretty clean, huh?  It's clean.  Look, a thousand young couches.  Let's go back to this stain over here.  I think this might be just part of the...  No, that's a stain.  Okay.  We definitely have one stain in it.  All right.  Well, hopefully tomorrow we'll get a bunch more stains on that thing.  Okay.  Sorry, Jimmy.  You won't be here.  That was nice.  I like that.  The lights were out.  The X-Files music playing.  Yeah, I like the lights out.  The weird black light on, like they're investigating something.  Very nice.  That was good.  Well, guys, the show became more gooder today. 
[01:33:00]  We now have our lesbian couch back.  Yeah.  I'm glad there's no lesbians here to use it.  I know.  Tomorrow.  Yeah, tomorrow we're going to do it.  Maybe they can't make it tomorrow.  The lights will come out tomorrow.  All right.  Well, I hope you appreciate it.  Very much.  Use it often.  So when did you get married?  I was supposed to get married this month.  But what happened?  Why?  Why?  Because of the store closing and other stuff, so we decided to push it off to the summer. 
[01:33:30]  What was the other stuff?  Did he bring it up to you?  Oh, no.  It had nothing to do with Ben.  No?  He didn't bring it up to you and say, perhaps, you know, the store closing, we should push  this off?  Yeah, guys tend to really want to postpone those things.  Who's Ben?  I still be my fancy.  Oh, I'm thinking of Ben Sparks here.  Don't say.  Our own producer.  So maybe he whipped out that big, delicious treat.  It's not a big deal.  No?  No.  It's one of those take it or leave it, married or not married things?  Well, whatever.  It will happen.  Isn't it kind of an important thing, though? 
[01:34:00]  It is.  You should be kind of excited about that, no?  You know, yeah, you are, but you can't dwell on it if it happens.  You know, you've got to postpone it.  If it happens, it happens.  If it happens, you know.  There's a story here.  Yeah.  What's the story?  Come on.  How long have you dated Ben?  I have been dating Ben for a little over three years.  Okay.  Cool.  His mom owns the store, you know.  Uh-uh.  The mom doesn't like you.  Oh, no.  No?  She's in New York.  Oh.  She's cool.  It's just that the economy went down the shitter. 
[01:34:30]  No, it didn't.  People don't want to buy stuff that's used.  Listen to Bush.  It didn't.  It's got leaves on it, yeah.  Yeah, they want to buy new stuff and not pay two years in no interest, you know, so they  don't want to go spend their money.  Oh, it was used furniture.  Because it's a consignment shop.  Exactly.  It's all used stuff.  Oh, okay.  People kind of want new furniture.  Yeah, they want their furniture without splooches.  They want clean furniture.  They want to shop at Siemens, not have furniture with semen on it.  Exactly.  Right.  That's what they...  They want clean stuff. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you have sales on Tuesday?  Starting at noon.  We're selling the best used furniture with the biggest splooge stains.  This Tuesday night, come in for our splooge stain spectacular at splooge stains.  No, of course it's not named splooge stains.  Your store wasn't named splooge stains, was it?  No.  And I'm not going to say the name of the store.  Okay.  So now things with Ben, you kind of, you want to get married, but... 
[01:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  We're totally going to get married.  We're now changing the entire concept of the wedding.  We were going to do that typical, you know, big reception, and everyone sits down for  dinner, and the photographer, and the limo, you know, that whole...  You're going to tame it down?  The whole wedding.  Now it's going to be...  Just get a tent in the backyard.  No, that's what we're doing.  We're going...  Money was an issue.  I'm not going to lie.  Okay.  Money was a total issue.  So...  Well, it sounds like it.  Just a tent with a bunch of load-stained couches?  We started spending $30,000.  We're going to cut it back probably to $10,000. 
[01:36:00]  Fine.  So...  Wow.  We'll just have a big, fat party this summer, and...  All right.  It sort of sounds like you're going through a tough time.  No.  I mean, not necessarily.  No?  I'm getting through it.  I'm fine.  Well, it sounds like the anxiety, and the furniture store closing, and the marriage having  to be postponed and scaled back.  I'm a mess.  Fine.  Yeah.  It does sound like, you know, it's a little bit of stress in your life.  And I'm glad you could take time out from your stressful life and bring us a lesbian  couch.  So I had all the time in the world.  There are other ways to earn money. 
[01:36:30]  Jimmy will show you.  At the nasty hotel I stayed at last night next door.  Oh, did you stay in the city?  I stayed next door at...  How do you get the couch here?  In your car?  In a minivan.  In a minivan.  Which hotel did you stay at?  The one to the...  Is it the one Opie used to stay at?  Similar.  Oh, yeah?  What's it called?  I don't know.  You tell us.  The one right here, to the right of the building.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't even know there was a hotel there.  The Salisbury Hotel.  Isn't that awful?  Isn't that a homeless hotel?  I walked in going, ooh.  I think that's a flop house. 
[01:37:00]  It's like a flop house or something.  I thought it was classy.  No.  So not.  Lit Park and Meridian is right across the street.  And then we walked in and it's...  And that's a wonderful hotel.  I love it.  Why didn't you stay at the old Park and Meridian?  I didn't even know it was there.  Because business is bad.  No, not necessarily.  I don't really care.  I can't afford it, Jim, okay?  Thanks for rubbing it in.  I wouldn't stay there.  For four hours?  I mean, I got to bed at midnight.  She can't afford her wedding and you spend $30,000 a year on hookers.  Why did you get up in the morning?  Why did you...  Why did you...  I didn't know what time necessarily you guys could take it in. 
[01:37:30]  So I just decided to...  We were trying to sleep after the anxiety medication and thinking about the business going down  and sleeping in the hotel with the red neon light blinking through the window.  So...  Actually, no.  I fell right to sleep and then I got up and showered and came over here.  Really?  For you guys.  Wasn't that big a deal?  No.  I'm sorry.  I got nothing.  I'm a mess.  I'm trying to sleep and this is outside.  What?  What?  I just want to drop the couch off. 
[01:38:00]  I don't know.  I'm glad I brought it to you guys.  No, are you kidding me?  No, we're happy.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, no.  I'm glad.  That's better than the last one we had.  It was a little road trip for me to take, you know?  Yeah.  No.  Awesome.  We'll give you some prizes.  Yeah.  I actually have prizes for you guys.  What do you have?  What do you have?  I brought some other stuff for you.  What?  What gifts?  Do you like me to get it?  Sure would.  Yeah.  I am...  No.  Not donkey sausage.  No, no, no.  No, follow Ben out the door and get the other stuff. 
[01:38:30]  What kind of gifts?  I don't know.  It's just a little stuff.  All right.  Yeah.  Go get the gifts.  Yeah.  I'd like a gift.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  Opie, it's on outside.  Oh.  No, I want to...  Audio's on outside.  She's coming back in with her gifts.  All right.  Shut up, Ben.  Jesus.  Ben's giggling like a nut out there.  Bring her in.  Bring her in.  I didn't know what you were doing.  Bring the lady in with the gifts.  Jesus.  Bring in the present lady.  I'll hear the replay.  Talk anything about me. 
[01:39:00]  I really don't care.  That's what sucks about this show.  Don't.  Stupid replay.  Stupid replay.  Don't defend me.  No.  All right.  We like you, actually.  Yeah.  What kind of gifts?  What do we got?  It's a magazine.  A sink magazine that we're in?  A buying gift.  That we have?  Huh?  You want to sign it.  The sink.  You want us to sign stuff?  That's a gift.  And what's with the pink hat?  Pink hat?  Is that a gift?  Is that yours?  Steve, we got a gift.  No.  Like I said, the store's closed and, you know, I listen all the time. 
[01:39:30]  So, you know, I heard a couple different things.  Oh, boy.  I went to the store and grabbed some stuff just for...  All righty.  Let's see what she's got for everybody.  Well, I have...  Buckle in.  ...because Opie has nothing to entertain with.  I grabbed something.  Uh-oh.  Oh, it's not that.  What is it?  Is it one of those things that's used for jacking off, like, in 10 to midnight?  No.  It's just a simple little dish that he can just throw on the table.  Oh, and, like, chips can go in there?  Oh, wow.  This is like a housewarming.  Wow. 
[01:40:00]  Hey, you haven't got a housewarming gift yet, have you?  Oh, boy.  So you gave Opie something that is breakable.  I really, you know, it's just crap and stuff.  Wait till we all get our gifts.  Why would you give Opie something that he could perhaps accidentally drop?  You could have washed it before you gave it to me.  Jesus.  This leftover dip in the dip part.  Check the price tag on the back.  She spent $13.50 on me.  Thank you.  And then I got two beer pitchers for you guys in case.  Oh, we might need pitchers.  That's true. 
[01:40:30]  Hey, I just grabbed some stuff.  Don't worry.  I don't understand.  Don't be defensive.  You're bringing us gifts, and we appreciate them.  Oh, I'm going to smash this.  No.  He is the worst.  What?  I didn't say anything.  Wow, now that's a nice pitcher.  It is a nice pitcher.  Is it glass?  No, it's that hard plastic, right?  It's plastic.  Those are good to drink a lot of beer out of if you're starring in Young Frankenstein.  I thought it was glass.  All right, what's that?  What do you got over there?  Looks like a Claymore mine. 
[01:41:00]  What is that?  Oh, I think it's...  Poker chips?  Poker chips.  From a 1940s...  It's poker chips that Al Capone used.  You obviously stopped at a garage sale on the way down to New York.  It looks like poker chips in a hat box.  Oh, they're in a hat box.  Wow.  Wow.  I got some...  You got any cards with those chips?  Yes.  Oh, let's have a little hand just for fun.  I could sit here now and shuffle chips with one hand. 
[01:41:30]  Wow.  Like they do on the World Series of Poker.  That's just wonderful.  This is good.  I'll bet there's a gift for Jim Norton in there.  This probably sat on top of a 60s style folding poker table for years.  I hate my gift.  What is that?  I'm sure it's a joke because they were ranking on you.  You had nothing.  What is...  What's that?  My gift stinks.  Oh, wow.  Oh, they're playing cards from the Moshe Suck Valley Railroad Company. 
[01:42:00]  What the fuck is this?  Wow, I guess there must be some more gifts in there.  Now that's it.  No?  Wait, you got a beer pitcher for Jim?  I just grabbed him for all of you to use.  But what about Jim?  It's for everybody.  But that's not fair.  No, these are for everybody.  It's not necessarily, I mean...  But I don't drink alcohol.  Exactly.  Could someone open the window?  Yeah, I'll take it back. 
[01:42:30]  All right.  Name of the game is Texas Hold'em, boys.  Ooh, you got chips and everything.  Yeah.  That would be great if they weren't...  That pack wasn't missing aces.  Card with little...  Are there 52 in this?  I don't think there's 52 cards there.  I never brought these in.  At least the other pack of cards is still wrapped.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got one wrapped, one unwrapped.  Would you gamble at the bus station on the way here?  Yes, I did.  And then this pack, because there's four decks of cards, both of these are still wrapped. 
[01:43:00]  Atta boy.  I'd love to know where these came from.  No idea.  Where'd you get them?  The store.  What store?  Her store.  Someone probably bought them.  I can't imagine why the store is going under.  I just can't fathom with little tidbits like this.  Little trinkets and knick-knacks.  Yeah, you might need better stuff in your store.  Maybe that's what it is.  Wow.  You were selling this?  There's plenty of stuff in there that was very nice. 
[01:43:30]  I bet.  That's only the best for your pals, huh?  You can throw it out the window.  Opie, stop looking around.  I know him.  You break it.  I'd be happy if you broke it.  I'm just trying to figure out where I could break it.  This place is so nice and new.  No, no.  This state-of-the-art studio that we're in.  It's a bit.  Opie doesn't really break things.  There's a gang from XM Satellite built for us.  Opie doesn't really break things.  It's a joke.  I never broke a thing in my life.  It's a bit.  Oh, the cars have little trains on them.  Yeah, little choo-chos. 
[01:44:00]  Choo-choo!  Well, if you haven't broken anything yet, you might as well,  because it could be the first thing you break in the studio.  You broke your mouth, but that could be the second thing.  That's a good gift.  You could have people over.  You could put the dip in the one thing and the chips in the surrounding dish.  Well, Martha Stewart.  Very good suggestion.  All right, well, this is lovely.  Thank you.  I'm done.  There's your couch.  All right.  Thank you for the couch and the gifts and everything.  You're welcome. 
[01:44:30]  Why do you look so dejected?  Yeah.  I'm very happy.  I play cards, and now I have chips and choo-choo train cards.  Yeah, now you have two packs of cards and a felt case.  Yeah, the case is felt with some gold leaf trim on the side.  That's right.  It's like an old velour shirt I had when I was eight.  Can I see those pictures?  Yeah.  I promise you're not going to break in front of me.  Don't break anything, Opie.  No, I need the other one, too.  That's not bad.  Oh, I can't break this.  No, why would you?  It's glass.  It is glass, right?  It's glass.  They're both real glass? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, people will.  It's plastic.  I was ready to shower to that.  No, I wasn't.  I'm kidding.  No.  All right, Ben.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  We got the lesbian couch, which we will use tomorrow.  Opie got a nice gift, and Anthony got a nice gift, and I don't drink, but I have beer  pictures that I can share.  You can put some soda pop in it.  You don't like the New York Times, do you?  You can put some soda pop in it.  Maybe I can have a Coke.  All right, thank you.  Oh, you're welcome, guys.  Okay.  Have a good one. 
[01:45:30]  Thank you.  We have to take our picture, don't we?  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, don't.  Don't.  You're going to go right through that window.  It's going to go through the control room window.  No, Opie.  Oh, my God, no.  Opie, don't.  Don't do it.  She's still in there.  Oh, my God.  See, you put dip in that, and then you put the chips in the... 
[01:46:00]  It's not even washed out.  It's nice.  And you can...  Look at the remnants from the dip.  It's a going away party.  Great party, isn't it?  When you have your little party on Sunday for football?  Yeah.  Why is this place so nice?  There's nothing to break in on.  Nah, you know, don't drop it on the floor.  Opie, Opie, Opie.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You just gave Jaime a heart attack.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Opie.  Oh, my God.  You threw it.  Oh, my God. 
[01:46:30]  It's broken all over.  Yeah, you got the little...  Now you just separated.  You can put the dip in that dish.  All right.  I'm not even looking out the window.  I can't even look at her face now.  Why?  Because she gave you something, and you broke it.  I didn't think it would break that easily.  It's ceramic.  It's rare when you throw ceramic on a hard floor that it breaks.  So I could see where you'd be confused.  Oh, my God. 
[01:47:00]  You are the worst human.  She's ready for her picture with you, Opie.  I can't even look at her face.  No.  Why?  Oh, God.  Not even smiling at all.  I can't believe you.  I cannot believe you.  You can fix that.  A little glue.  Opie, look out the window.  Look out the window.  She's going to cry.  I'm sorry.  Is she smiling?  You can put this right back together.  This is not even that much damage. 
[01:47:30]  All right.  Well.  Oof.  All right.  Well.  Let's get out of this uncomfortable situation, please.  She's really hurt.  They're practicing being cruel and unusual.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is Opie.  One half of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony, I don't know where he is.  He's probably listening to this in his car, though.  As I'm working, sitting here, saying stupid shit into a microphone. 
[01:48:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Norton was just lying on the lesbian couch.  It stinks, huh?  It's fine.  It smells moldy.  I'm just tired.  I don't care.  All right.  Well, I like the lesbian couch.  Thumbs up to the lesbian couch.  It'll smell like...  It has only one splooge stain, so that's good.  That'll change up.  Were you trying to give her a thumbs up through the window?  Did you notice that?  Thumbs up.  I'm with you. 
[01:48:30]  She's just staring into space.  She's not even looking at you.  I'm not trying to make up for smashing her gift.  I just kind of tossed it to the side, and then it's shattered.  I don't know.  It's ceramic, and you broke it on purpose, and you giggled.  You're an awful person.  All right, well...  Your aunt's doing nothing but trashing those awful 1951 poker chips.  Yeah, see, that's the difference, though, man.  What?  Why don't you say what you were saying during the commercial break?  How much I hate your poker chips.  I said...  And wish I had balls like me.  That these days...  Those chips stink.  Nowadays, you can get chips out of the same chips you play with in Vegas. 
[01:49:00]  You know who uses chips like that?  Third graders.  Yeah, these chips are...  They need a little weight.  They don't have any weight for them.  They need some weight.  These are the plastic chips you used to play with with your junior high buddies.  They're awful.  You'd steal them from your parents and play poker.  They are awful plastic chips.  Give her the chips back.  Yeah, you gotta give them back.  Just tell her you don't want them.  You might have to, man.  Oh, Brady's a good point.  Tell her you don't want her stupid chips. 
[01:49:30]  Why do I have to be part of your rudeness?  Because you're like all brave when we're in commercial break.  But I can understand, you know, that something might suck and I might hate it, but I'm not going to...  And, Norton, what about you?  These gifts stink.  They do stink.  I don't want to be known as the bad guy today.  Hatbox full of chips.  Hatbox.  The Lucille Ball hatbox she bought when she was out with Viv.  She got that from a garage sale.  That little stupid hat in the box.  Yeah.  Now, take it back, Lucy.  Now, Anthony, what's what it looks like?  Call her back in here. 
[01:50:00]  But I understand I can get a bad gift and still be nice and not hurt people's feelings.  Call her back in here and give her her gift back.  Why do I have to hurt someone's feelings?  I will not bow to peer pressure and hurt someone's feelings.  Call her out on her gift.  I will tell her her gift sucks.  But I will keep it.  Oh, you will, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's see Anthony say that.  You're really not coming back in here.  Are you insane?  Hi, Erica.  I just wanted to say, Opie had a little mishandling of your gift.  He bobbled it a little while he was trying to put it over by his stuff and it broke. 
[01:50:30]  But I have the cards and chips and thank you.  You guys, I know, I know.  Anthony, tell her.  Throw them out.  You hate them.  I don't care.  Tell her.  Don't bother me.  What?  Are those good chips?  I'm not saying that they're bad chips.  Are they good chips?  No, they're old.  They're probably from the 70s.  I just grabbed them.  70s earth mama chips.  70s earth mama muff chips.  It would have been cool if it came from Frank Sinatra's house, but obviously it didn't.  You know, they could be worth money. 
[01:51:00]  You don't know.  I don't know.  If they weren't money, you'd be getting married.  What's wrong with that?  That's a genuine wood chip holder, isn't it?  Hey, give me those chips.  I guess that's good for my faith, Steve.  Give Opie the chips.  Look, I'm just thinking I like them.  I really do.  But I'm thinking maybe somebody else could use them more than I could.  I'd be more than happy to take them and throw them in the trash for you, Anthony.  No, I'm not going to throw them in the trash, but perhaps somebody could use them more than I could. 
[01:51:30]  Tell her.  I'll take them back, Anthony.  Just give them to me.  Tell her.  She's yelling.  Tell her.  I'm trying to be nice.  What do you mean?  Why am I being yelled at?  You play Texas Hold'em.  Why can't you use those?  Well, they're just not quite the type of equipment I like playing with.  What kind do you like playing with?  They're chips and cards.  Well, different cards and different chips.  People play with different types of things.  Yes, sir.  I'll pass it back to her.  Just give her the chips.  Just, Opie, give those to her.  It's heavy. 
[01:52:00]  Here, these are the cards that are still.  There you go.  They're all wrapped up.  See, they're still wrapped.  They're all wrapped up.  You ever play 52-card pick-up?  Oh, gee.  Opie.  There's no reason I eat the cards at her.  Did the cards hit you?  Did they?  Opie, she had cards falling off her sleeve.  Come on.  No.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, my God.  Opie. 
[01:52:30]  Holy shit.  Opie.  Don't videotape.  Oh, boy.  Now clean it up!  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  I am mortified.  Oh, Eric, she spilled my chips.  I'm not mortified.  I knew you'd do stuff like this.  You're a thing. 
[01:53:00]  She spilled my chips.  Oh, God.  You guinea brat.  Now clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  Oh, my God.  I'm mortified.  I apologize for the other half of this program.  Don't apologize.  I don't really care.  That is uncalled for. 
[01:53:30]  That was uncalled for.  I hope you got a good laugh.  I hope you got a good laugh.  God, he's still immersed in it.  It's fine.  He can laugh all the time.  I can't even talk to you.  That is horrible, man.  I knew from the start it was a bad idea to bring those in in the first place.  I should have just brought the couch and be done with it. 
[01:54:00]  That is horrible.  Look, I didn't have a problem with him or anything.  Oh, for some reason, I don't understand why he's got to be like that.  Oh, my God.  I apologize for the actions of some of the people on this program, you know.  Well, enjoy picking up your poker chips.  Thank you. 
[01:54:30]  You guys can finish your show and talk about me and do whatever you want.  I don't care.  All right.  There she goes.  Wait, wait.  She's walking away.  Wait, can you take these?  Oh, look, she's getting her stuff.  She's not even going to sit back down now.  She's getting her stuff and walk.  Oh, my God.  There she goes.  Ben, go smooth things over.  Ben, Ben, smooth things over a little bit.  Remember when Rick had to smooth things over?  Guess what?  Now it's your fucking job. 
[01:55:00]  If you wanted to be the big dog, go ahead.  There it is.  Yeah, you're the big producer now.  Go fix that.  That is the biggest laugh I've had on the show.  We broke it.  You fix it.  Because the way you threw them and rolled them across the console,  it was a heavy stud, and they rolled and all just fell off.  And the chips were flying out, and the chip carrier fell on her foot.  It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen one person do to another.  That's the biggest laugh I've had on the show.  I couldn't breathe.  You are an awful person.  I literally could not breathe. 
[01:55:30]  I was laughing so hard.  I don't know how you do that.  That just makes me so happy.  Those are things you think about doing sometimes, but no human does them.  But Opie, just stay.  I'll break your bowl.  I'll throw the chips at you.  I'll fling the cards at your face.  These chips have coffee stains on them.  These are awful.  See, now you're brave.  I can't be brave with you.  Holy S.  The back of my skull hurts.  I laugh so hard.  Eric from Jersey.  The sound of plastic chips raining to the floor is the saddest sound I've ever heard. 
[01:56:00]  It will be like the sound of the thousands of tears she's going to shed in the car.  Yeah.  Just walked outside with Ben.  Ben's talking to her right now.  Yeah.  Gave her a nice garbage bag full of ONA stuff.  She is bawling, crying.  Oh, my God.  See?  I knew it.  Here's what she said.  She goes, I don't mind if he broke it, but he threw it at me.  Oh, no.  And she turned her face into the wall near the elevator, and that's all you're hearing. 
[01:56:30]  Stop it.  You are horrible.  Cringe radio is back, boys and girls.  It's about effing time.  She threw the chips.  I didn't throw him at her.  Hold on a minute.  I think being smooth, though.  He actually didn't throw him at her.  I'm going to go check now.  I was a very good athlete when I was growing up, and trust me, I didn't throw him at her.  Go fix that.  I made it very close, but go fix that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's awful. 
[01:57:00]  I cannot believe that.  I'm horrified.  All right.  Opie has no soul.  Evil to the core.  Yeah.  That's what they're writing.  And I wonder why I'm alone.  Opie is the effing Antichrist.  And I wonder why I'm alone.  I go home alone every day, and I wonder why.  Why am I alone?  Jesus.  Can't figure that one out.  You made her cry.  I didn't want her to cry.  She was nice, and she tried to be good-natured about it. 
[01:57:30]  I know.  She tried to take the ribbing.  It was the loud chips falling before the thing rolled off the console.  That was a big bet.  I'm all in.  I will splash the pot whenever the fuck I please.  Dude, you've got to read something to the end, some feedback.  This guy, Cody, from Buffalo.  Opie put some good force into throwing those chips.  Sounds like some South American ring stick. 
[01:58:00]  No, that's...  I was horrified during that whole thing.  An update?  Yeah.  Yeah, Ben's calming her down.  Steve's out there.  They're, you know, getting her to breathe and calm down.  And they're going to try to see if she wants to come back in and get her picture.  Yeah, because she wanted pictures and stuff.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Tell her if she cleans up.  If she...  Say you're brave without her in the studio. 
[01:58:30]  That's the difference.  I admit it.  That's the difference between you and I.  Say that to her face.  No, I've done enough.  Haven't you done enough?  I think I've done enough.  I can't...  I don't know even...  What's going on out there?  It's just, it's not fun, Ope.  You threw it right at her.  I didn't throw it right at her.  Do we have the videotape?  You didn't get that on videotape?  Yeah, I did.  You got that on videotape?  It kind of rolled on the console.  I kind of just rolled it at her.  Okay, well...  She had plenty of time to get out of the way. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, jeez.  She's a little upset.  Yeah, I would guess.  She drove all the way here from Rhode Island.  Used to give something to the show.  Yeah.  Wanted to get her photo.  Oh, my God.  She comes here to give something to the show and get a picture with Opie and Anthony.  Well, maybe she should have gave something to us from this decade.  Who are you to say that our gifts aren't good enough?  You know what?  He raised frankincense and myrrh not a good enough gift, Opie.  We're starting a rule on this show.  You bring gifts, don't get them from a garage sale. 
[01:59:30]  That's all we ask.  You know, baby Jesus' best gift he got was a song from a little drummer boy, Opie.  That's right.  It had nothing to do with materialism.  It had nothing to do with the gold, frankincense, and myrrh might have been good gifts.  But the little drummer boy's song was the best gift of all.  And I'd have taken that over those lousy chips.  All right.  Well, let me see the video, Anthony.  All right.  Here's the video.  We're looking back at the tape.  She's all smiley.  Steve, I'll need a screening when you're done there. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, my God.  Well, you kind of missed the toss, but you got the aftermath.  I wasn't really expecting you to do that.  Oh, gee.  What did you think you were going to do?  Play a hand?  It's like catching a UFO.  You're just not expecting it.  Wow.  That's my look at Norton.  This is going to be great for foundrymusic.com.  I'm all in.  Show Anthony.  All right.  Bring that over here.  I got to see that.  I think the audio will really help that clip because you were too close on her face.  But all you see is the chips go flying by her.  All right. 
[02:00:30]  Well.  All right.  Let me get a look.  All right.  There's Opie with the devious smile on his face.  She's talking.  Still, yes.  Smiling.  Oh, my God.  No.  That's.  Oh, you see it clearly.  Did you see the chips flying by on the table?  Yes, Ben.  Not as if we've done enough damage to being in this new building already.  Yeah.  There's people just coming to work, getting off the elevator.  Yeah.  You see this all going on in the hallway and are just mortified.  Oh, they see her crying out front.  Him filming it. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, no.  See that?  Yeah.  Not even trying to comfort her.  Could you face it this way when you break down emotionally?  Oh, my God.  Oh, I'm horrified.  I am horrified.  Yeah, I'm not going to fix this one.  See, this is the type of thing, the barrier that people say, you know, how far do you take  things on satellite?  That's where, you know, I think the line should have been drawn somewhere.  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  Girl just kind of bring some gifts to the show.  I definitely.  Give me those.  I'll pass them to her.  She enjoys.  What?  What?  Give me those.  I'll pass them to her.  You're horrible, man.  That clip is hilarious.  You can see her face.  I mean, in the background, you can see the chips just lying behind the table.  Look at the construction workers looking at them like, what the hell is going on in there?  All right.  Well, can we take our last break and then regroup here, I guess?  I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that was great.  Why don't you go out and take your picture with her, Ove? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Old fan from the AF days.  She's been a fan since the AF days.  Whatever.  The first time in 10 years she's going to meet us.  Go buy Demento World and shut up.  No.  She's a nice lady.  Learn to play poker with the Ove and Anthony Show.  No.  Oh, God.  She spilled my chip.  I'm sorry, sir.  Oh, baby.  Oh, my God. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, my God.  Now, clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  He's up on the gay shit.  Oh, gee.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, why don't you get your girlfriend, the Liberator, this year, Anthony?  The Liberator?  I can't believe you haven't heard about the Liberator yet.  I have never heard of this thing. 
[02:03:00]  They're advertising this in the back of almost every magazine now.  But now it's in a regular newspaper.  Yeah, this was in the New York Post today.  You haven't heard about the Liberator?  Cure Common what?  What does that ad say?  Cure Common Liberator.  I don't know.  It just says Cure Common.  Cure Common?  Is the headline that says Liberator adds.  It's supposed to spice up your sex life?  Well, the Liberator adds dimension to your bed that elevates lovers for convenient access  and targeted contact. 
[02:03:30]  What?  Yep.  You've never heard of the Liberator?  It looks like a big, like, cheese wedge.  Is it?  It's a cushion?  Yeah, it's like a cheese wedge cushion.  A wedge-shaped cushion.  The only way to explain it.  It looks like it's got hatches on it.  What the hell is...  So then the lady lays her belly on the Liberator and her head is way down.  Yeah.  And her butt is way up.  That's the part of the wedge that goes way up.  And then you, yeah, you mount from behind and gives you convenient access and targeted 
[02:04:00]  contact, Anthony.  This is specifically made for backdoor action.  Doggy style, yeah.  Offering scores of positions to explore.  They also come with...  Wait.  Scores of positions?  I'm thinking only one position if you use the Liberator.  Well, wait a minute.  She could lay the other way, right?  Uh-huh.  Hang her head off the high end of the wedge, and then you could walk up to her.  How are you doing?  Uh-huh.  Offering scores of positions to explore.  They also come with washable covers, so you can get freaky with lotions, potions, and 
[02:04:30]  gourmet notions.  Yeah, because that's why it's washable.  Yeah.  Not from the splooge that'll be all over it.  Eric, see if you can get them on the phone, because it says for a free guide, call 1-800-blah-blah-blah.  Ooh.  I want to talk to the people that make the Liberator today.  The Liberator?  Why would they even name it that?  But it's a big cheese wedge, and I guess you just keep it in the closet, and then what?  You've got to pull that thing out.  Hey, honey.  We've discussed this, you know?  Honey.  Honey, I got the Liberator out.  I'm hanging over the Liberator. 
[02:05:00]  Get ready for some real action.  And you pop it on your bed and just bang over it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's too much.  It's one of those things we've discussed, you know, a lot of these things you use for sex.  Yeah, the props.  Props.  They sound good at the time, but then as soon as the orgasms are complete, you kind of look  at each other, and it's kind of awkward, no?  You feel silly that you've got to clean the cushions.  Right.  And pack it up.  Put all the dildos in the dishwasher until next time. 
[02:05:30]  They aren't selling that thing as something else, like a pillow.  No, this one, no.  Like some things they sell as regular items, and you know that they're meant for sex.  Like the back massagers in Brookstone?  The back massager.  It's a dildo.  Right.  It's a cylinder-shaped...  With a big vibrating head, but they're trying to claim it's for your back.  And the advertising picture is a woman smiling, holding it to the back of her neck?  Yeah.  I think you missed, honey.  Yeah, that's not where she wants to hold it.  No, they're not even fooling around with this one. 
[02:06:00]  It's all about getting the woman in the perfect position for backdoor sex.  And you're liberating what?  You're liberating the woman.  You're liberating your sex life?  Because I guess a lot of women out there don't get their G-spot hit.  And that's supposed to do it, huh?  Yeah, and maybe a lot of women are a little too shy to tell the guy,  hey, you're missing by a foot.  You might want to move it this way.  And you don't want to put the pillows that you're going to be laying your head on under there?  Is that it?  I guess not.  Getting all kinds of junk on there?  I guess not.  So now they have the liberator. 
[02:06:30]  Hey, congrats.  Yeah, that makes a great gift, I guess.  You know what to get, Grandma.  Hello?  Yes.  Who's this?  This is Connie.  How can I help you?  Connie, did they tell you you're going to be on the radio?  No, they did not.  You know, my people need to be fired.  Dumped out of that?  You can take her off now.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Will you talk to Connie, make sure she knows she's going on the radio?  I actually dumped out of that, Opie.  We had to dump out of that?  I hit the dump button.  Did it work? 
[02:07:00]  Hopefully I got it all.  Does the room over there understand that people can't be put on the air unless they know that  they're going to be on the radio?  Maybe we should have taken this week off.  Holy shit.  Because everyone is asleep around us.  How are they not informing?  That's rule one.  That's rule one.  When you get into radio and you get the big book.  It's rule one!  You get the big book of radio rules.  Guess what rule one is?  Well, now she's ready, right? 
[02:07:30]  All right, now Eric's yelling at me through the headphones.  Connie.  Yes.  Okay, you're live on the radio with Opie and Anthony, okay?  Okay.  And we saw the ad in the, I guess it was the New York Post here in New York.  Maybe the Daily News, I don't know.  They're pretty much the same stupid paper.  Bunch of junk in both of them.  But nice little advertisement for the Liberator.  Yes, there it is.  It's the cushion that is, I don't know, in the shape of a cheese wedge for the lady, right?  Yes, sir.  We have four specially designed portable cushions that allows couples to experience new positions. 
[02:08:00]  Really?  Four cushions?  Yes, sir.  Four shapes.  And explain what the cushions look like.  I'm describing like a cheese wedge.  Well, we have a cube that's just like a square block, and it's just for leaning on or sitting against.  Yeah.  We have the stage, and it's just a small cushion, like for a bed cushion. 
[02:08:30]  Large, large.  And then we have the wedge and the ramp, and both of those are triangle shape.  Triangle shape.  That's where you get that wedge where some parts of the body will be a little higher than others.  That's correct.  And that's supposed to be a good thing.  Yeah, my pal Anthony's not too sure how this Liberator thing works.  So, what, the lady lays down on her belly?  Either way you want.  You just use your imagination.  Oh.  Now, Connie, do you have any experience with the Liberator?  I do have mine. 
[02:09:00]  I've not used it yet.  It's on the way, but we do get quite a few orders.  The one that's most popular is called the Wedge Ramp Combo.  Wedge Ramp Combo.  You can get both the triangle shapes together.  I think that's what I'm seeing, the small triangle and the big triangle?  That is correct.  Basically, the small triangle is where she can rest her head, right?  You can use it as a pillow.  While you're just pounding her ass.  Either way.  Right.  And I see zippers on these things.  They are, they have two covers. 
[02:09:30]  One, the inside cover is like a silky covering.  And then the outside is a velvet covering.  And the zipper, obviously, so you can remove it, so you can throw it in the washing machine  to get all the splooge stains off, right?  That is correct.  Right.  Hey, is yours going to come with an ashtray?  How much do you smoke, man?  Well, we won't answer that one.  Yeah, maybe you ought to get off the cigarettes.  I heard that.  Yeah.  Holler.  Well, so why did you decide to get the Liberator? 
[02:10:00]  Well, as I said, it's just to explore new positions.  Yeah, and do you need to explore new positions in your relationship?  Well, we can always.  Yeah, that's true.  How long have you been married, Connie?  31 years.  31 years young.  I mean, 31 years married.  That's correct.  And you wanted to get your big old ass up in the air for your husband, right?  I guess.  You can say whatever you want.  Is your husband excited that this is on the way? 
[02:10:30]  I'm sure he is.  Really?  How do you know he's excited?  Does he know where your G-spot is?  Well, after 31 years, if they don't, I'm in trouble.  Right.  That's true.  And he knows how to hit it?  Hit it good?  I guess we do.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it good, yeah.  That's wonderful.  She's going to have her big old ass up in the air, and her husband's going to be pounding  away from behind hitting her G-spot.  Are you both in shape? 
[02:11:00]  I guess so.  I know how to take care of business.  Oh, I like that.  No, woman.  Yeah, what's your favorite move in bed?  I think I prefer to keep most of that to myself.  Oh.  What, you just play with yourself?  No, I said my preferability to my sex position.  Ah.  Hey, what is the Liberator going to set me back?  Well, each of the shakes have a different price.  What about if I want the big wedge, small wedge combo? 
[02:11:30]  That's $175 and $20 shipping.  But couldn't you just use the cushions from your couch?  Well, you can, but these, you won't be sliding around, or the cushions won't be moving while you're going about your business.  I have a question for you.  I have a question for you, too.  The Liberator, because of the shape, is it, say a girl, and I'm being very speculative here, but just say a girl has passed out, and you need her in a certain position, would the Liberator be more likely to keep her from jostling about? 
[02:12:00]  That's what I said.  You don't slide around and move, the cushions don't move while you're having sex.  But I'm saying if she was, like, incapacitated and passed out, because, like, you use the one wedge to get the hips in the air and liberate her of her dignity, and then you put the face on the other wedge to keep the breathing free.  Because sometimes if somebody's passed out, their face is in a pillow, it's hard for them to breathe.  You don't want them snoring, either.  Well, yeah, then there are other charges.  Well, no, I've not been asleep having my sex, so I don't know. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Well, is this good for the anal sex, too?  Yes, sir, it is.  Oh.  Any experience with that, Connie?  We'll keep our comments to ourselves.  Ah, that's a yes.  That's a yes, Connie.  All right, Connie.  After 31 years, you've got to imagine you gave that up a little bit there, right?  Of course.  Well, you don't have an imagination.  You won't last 31 years.  That's right.  Either that or he went after a 15-year-old girl.  Not quite, but a little bit.  So, no, people are buying this for the anal sex, huh? 
[02:13:00]  Well, as I said, you just have to use your own imagination.  There's quite a few positions.  But how does...  Each of the cushions do come with a position guide.  Oh, a position guide.  That's handy.  All right.  Yeah, what other positions are they using this for?  I'm just imagining a girl's butt up in the air.  Nice.  Okay.  What else?  Go ahead and imagine.  Oh, really?  Well, what's the guide say?  You have a guide you send.  So, what are some of the ones the guide may suggest?  Well, I don't have the guide in front of me, but, again, you can just use your own imagination. 
[02:13:30]  Connie, how did you get into selling these?  Well, I work for the call center that, you know, we have the account for it, Liberator Shakes.  Right.  And we sell them that way.  You sell other things there at the call center?  No, not through Liberator, no.  Oh, you just sell the Liberator.  Wow, I'm looking at another picture on the website.  Oh, my goodness.  Looks like he's ready to mount. 
[02:14:00]  Too bad you can't send the girl, too, the models.  Well, I guess.  Very.  Yeah, I would assume you're one of the models, too?  Just wish.  Just wish.  Do you wish or do we wish?  No, I wish.  Ah, I see.  Yeah, she really is a cute one.  Afraid not.  What's that, miss?  I said, afraid not.  All right, well, I'm seeing nude pictures.  Yeah, now we're seeing the nude pictures of the Liberator in action.  Right.  Have you looked at this website, Connie? 
[02:14:30]  Yes, I have.  Wow, you're pretty free-spirited, aren't you?  Well, in order to sell these, you have to kind of have an imagination and free spirit.  Yeah, go ahead.  No, I'm just looking at this one picture here of the blue.  They come in different colors, the covers?  Yes, they do.  So, the one is blue, so after you finish, it will look like a sky with clouds on it.  Well, if you don't know how to wash it, it might.  Yeah.  All right, well, that looks wonderful. 
[02:15:00]  I guess we'll be getting more information.  What do you got to do?  Get our address?  Hey, sure.  You want to go ahead and place an order?  You just want the brochure sent, too.  I think we want the brochure.  Well, the one position that I'm concerned with, because a lot of people, I think, are misconstruing  this, that it's only used for one style of sex.  And one of the pictures that was amazing, the guy is laying back on his back on the Liberator,  and his head is kind of propped up, while the girl is, um...  While the girl is, uh, what, Jimmy? 
[02:15:30]  I'm trying to say this politely.  All right.  And why are you biting your fist really hard?  She's, um...  You know what I'm talking about.  He's kind of sitting up with his back up, and she's, um, sucking his cock.  Okay.  Yeah, is this good for sucking cock?  Well, evidently so.  You're watching it.  Wow.  The Liberator's good for sucking cock, Anthony.  All right.  Thank God for that.  That's right.  Liberate me of a load.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Stop it, you.  All right, Con, anything else you want to tell us about the Liberator? 
[02:16:00]  I think a lot of our listeners want, uh, you know, one of these for their lovely, um,  wife.  Is this just for traditional couples, or can shit-ticks use it?  Anybody that wants to have different sex positions and experience, you know, different,  um, sex.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But even, you know, it even works with the, you know, what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about, Connie, the goddamn, the goddamn queers.  I guess they can.  Yeah.  We have a lot.  We have them for lesbians, uh, people that are straight and gay. 
[02:16:30]  Look at this, there's a picture here on the website.  Uh, the one girl's on her, she's got, like, complete, like, in the doggy style position,  but he's kind of, like, got her Liberator up on the bed, and he's got his face buried in  her cheeks.  Right.  He's, like, ass-eating.  He's, like, tonguing her asshole while she's hunched over the Liberator.  And she's kind of moaning as his tongue is in and out of her brown eye.  Okay.  Yeah, is it good for the ass-munching?  Evidently so, sir.  Again, you can use it for, you know, experiencing new positions, and you can put them in the 
[02:17:00]  floor, on the bed, on the couch, on the table, whatever you want to use it for.  I love Connie.  She is unflappable.  Connie just doesn't care.  You are great.  All right, Connie.  Is it good for sink fucking?  If you can fit it in there.  Yeah.  Well, I know a guy that likes to do that in hotel rooms.  Yeah, we have a guy that, uh, calls the show, he likes to fuck the sinks when he's on, um,  on, uh, on tour.  He goes into hotel rooms and lays on the sink and puts his, uh, you know, his junk into 
[02:17:30]  the sink and lays on the counter, and then he, uh, spanks it and doesn't have to worry  about cleanup.  Well, that's one way of doing it.  That's pretty resourceful, I would say.  Yes, it is.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Connie.  So.  Hey, you've been great.  You've given us a lot of, uh, worthwhile information, and if we could get a brochure, that'd be fantastic.  Okay.  And whose name are you going to put this in?  Uh.  Ben Sparks.  Everybody's going to talk at once.  Ben Sparks. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Okay, one second, sir.  What's the address?  It's 111 57th Street.  I'm sorry, 111 West 57th Street.  Uh, fifth floor.  Suite 500.  Suite 500.  Um, New York, New York.  And what's the zip?  One zero zero one nine.  One zero zero one.  I don't know why I'm repeating it unless you didn't hear it.  And make sure you send the brochure for the, the gay sex positions, all right?  Great.  Okay, and whose name again?  Ben Sparks.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  I got it down.  He's got a huge hog.  It's awful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He has, like, one of those retard hogs.  It looks like he's smuggling it.  You might have a lot of enjoyment out of these.  Oh.  Oh, look at you, Ben, huh?  His cock is known as the liberator.  It liberates women of their walking abilities.  Okay, then you might need to get more than one set of liberators.  Oh.  Yeah.  True.  One for him, one for the girl, and one for his hogs.  That's right.  Yeah, can you pile up these liberators so you can kind of have sex in between the two liberators? 
[02:19:00]  Ooh.  If you can manage to keep them still.  Hey, Connie, you like the big hogs or the little hogs?  Well, we'll keep my preferability to myself again.  Let's just say I bet Connie's happy with her husband.  Yes.  Evidently so.  Yeah.  Where are you, Connie?  Are you in New York?  No, sir.  I'm in Georgia.  Oh, okay.  Georgia.  You're a Georgia peach.  Yes, sir.  Ha, ha.  That's a little rotten.  Oh, bae.  All right.  Did you get all the info you need? 
[02:19:30]  I've got Ben Sparks, 111 West 57th Street, Fleet 500, New York, New York, 10019.  Could you throw something a little special in there for him?  Yes, sir.  And also, let me get the email address.  Yes, it's, um...  Yellow trees.  Yellow trees.  No.  Do you want ben.sparks at xm.com?  Yeah, just keep...  Yeah, uh, yeah, there you go.  Okay.  Yeah, it's, um...  Excuse me.  No, no, no, no, no.  This is not for listeners to email Ben about his big cock. 
[02:20:00]  This is only for Connie.  Ben.sparks.  Okay.  Ben.sparks at xmradio.com.  I think that's it.  By the way, this is not for listeners to write about Ben's big duties or his big delicious  cock.  Or if you have some gossip that you want to pass on to Ben.  No, nothing like that.  I would never quit ringing, right?  Oh, wow.  No, this is only for Connie.  You listeners out there, don't even think about annoying Ben, because he'd hate that.  He really would. 
[02:20:30]  He really would.  Yes, I would.  Do you miss Carlo?  Me?  Connie?  Go ahead.  Oh, I thought you knew Carlo.  No.  Who?  No.  I'm afraid not.  Carlo Rizzi.  No.  No?  Oh, okay.  I thought you might have known him.  No.  All right.  All right.  Well, I guess we found out a lot about the Liberator today, thanks to Connie, who loves  sex.  How's Merle in Reno? 
[02:21:00]  Okay.  I don't know him either.  Ah.  I thought she would have known him.  All right, Connie.  Well, you enjoy your banging.  Okay.  And I guess that's it, right?  We're done with Connie?  You were great, Connie.  Thank you very much.  You're welcome, and I'll have a great day.  All right.  You too.  There she goes.  Connie?  Yes.  Hello?  Hmm. 
[02:21:30]  I think she hung up.  I wanted to ask her something, too.  Yeah.  Connie?  Connie?  Connie?  You had her.  She was unflappable.  She was great.  Wow.  I'm sure she's hurt at all, though, right?  Well, when you're selling the Liberator, I'm sure she has hurt at all.  Probably not like that, though.  Okay.  I thought I'd get her with that sucking...  Nothing.  Nothing.  He just didn't care.  Well, you can do whatever you like.  The Liberator.  Liberate your wallet of money for nothing. 
[02:22:00]  For no reason.  Just use your couch cushions.  Don't need that.  What is that?  Well, just wait until your kids are sleeping and just lay over one of them.  They won't know.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Well, Ben's getting emailed.  Oh, show stuff, I hope.  Freddie at CagedTour.com.  How big is your big duty, Ben?  How big is your big duties?  How big is your retarded cock?  Timothy, subject, big cock.  Sorry, Ben.  Just had to do it. 
[02:22:30]  Kurt, subject, big cock.  And then he just writes, pictures, question mark.  And then there's Chief, who just writes big cock about a hundred times.  And then, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, very excitedly.  Noah writes, I have a rabied squirrel in my backyard.  Could you beat it to death with your huge cock?  Shit, dick. 
[02:23:00]  Did he spell it right?  Rabied or rabid?  I don't know.  R-A-B-I-D.  Yeah, I messed up.  All right.  Sorry.  Carl, guess what I heard is the subject.  I heard that you have a huge, delicious hog.  And this guy's using his Nextel two-way message.  Ben, you guys rock.  Happy holidays to all at ONA.  P.S.  Good luck with the Liberator.  That's within the first five minutes.  The fact that people are writing to ben.sparks at xmradio.com, this type of filth. 
[02:23:30]  This is not what these email addresses are for.  This is only for business.  We're trying to get some work done, guys.  You've really got to stop.  You don't want to send them emails addressed to old gravy legs.  Stuff like that is ridiculous, stupid, and a waste of time.  There you go.  All right, Ben.  I think we took care of it.  Yeah, it should be fun.  Yeah, it should be fun.  Office accounts.  Oh, yeah, geez.  Our listeners respect that.  They won't do that again.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  A few bad apples there. 
[02:24:00]  Comparing Ben's cock to Connor Peterson.  I mean, why would you do that in an email?  Evil.  And loving it.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I almost broke my vagina.  Drink until she's pretty.  It's a freak show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they're not awful.  Okay, terrific.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  No more of that.  It's bad for you.  Well, Anthony, the list of dangerous toys is out.  Oh, Christmas.  Is out.  Every year there's a bunch of toys that are made. 
[02:24:30]  Get recalled.  And they get recalled as a public.  A little tykes choke on stuff.  The New York Public Interest Research Group.  I guess they buy all the toys, test them, and then decide which ones are very dangerous for your child.  Throw them in ten cribs and count how many living babies there are after the day's worth of play.  Yeah, I wonder how they do their experiments.  And the news, man.  Bunches.  That one's blue.  The news.  They're just a bunch of scumbags.  Because I saw this the other day.  Coming up, is the child. 
[02:25:00]  Is the child.  Jesus, I got it now.  Is the toy your child playing with dangerous?  Yeah.  We'll tell you after this.  And there's your little Johnny in the other room playing with all his toys.  And you're wondering if one of those toys is going to kill him.  But you have to wait through the commercial break.  You got to wait.  Because these scumbags want to, you know, get their ratings up.  I've seen ones that it's not even a commercial break.  It's a teaser for the news that isn't even going to come on until later that night.  And they go, toys could kill your children.  We'll tell you which ones at 11. 
[02:25:30]  Are you driving a dangerous car?  Tune in at 11 o'clock.  For our insider investigation.  A popular food.  Poisoned.  We'll tell you what it is.  What?  I can't eat until...  What?  Nothing.  Very good.  So there's a list of the dangerous toys that we should be watching out for.  How dangerous are these?  Not really that...  I don't know.  I've never heard of any of these things.  Jimmy.  What?  I see you slipping a cheek off the chair. 
[02:26:00]  I actually did not do it.  Did not do it.  I promise you I didn't do it.  Then what the hell is that?  I lifted my cheek, but I was afraid if I eased it out, it was going to be a butterscotch pudding  extravaganza.  A tippy-tom on these?  Yeah, especially after one of those nice smoothies.  That's the last thing I knew.  I was blasting it into my socks.  So I stopped.  Choking hazard toys, not properly labeled.  Fun years, music, big drum, musical set.  Hot wheels, rev up cars.  Oh, you know what toy is really bad this year? 
[02:26:30]  Fist of drunken father when child is talking loud when it's supposed to be in bed.  That's a really dangerous one.  Careful.  Careful of that one.  Could cause bruising.  Did that happen to you as a kid?  No, it didn't.  But you've got to be careful, too.  The black kids are having a little problem with the toy this year.  Is that the, um, there's this toy called Teacher's Mouth makes your penis wet in certain  parts of Long Island.  Dangerous toys, Anthony.  Hot wheels, rev up cars. 
[02:27:00]  What's wrong with that one?  I don't know.  They don't tell you what's wrong with them?  Not really.  Just like little pieces?  Yeah, we're talking, well, these are the choking toys, so.  Choking hazards?  There's got to be parts that fall off that the kids could choke on.  But there's other hazards, too, but it's not just choking toys.  Choking hazard.  No, they've got categories.  In South Carolina, they're saying that you have to, the minivans are very bad for kids.  Oh, boy.  Especially when put in reverse.  And they still hate your hackling, by the way.  That bed can laugh and have fun. 
[02:27:30]  Fisher-Price Loving Family Pony Parade.  Oh!  You could choke on that.  You could choke on it.  Choke on the...  You could choke on it.  Choke on the pony penis.  Horse gag.  The baby Annabelle with pacifier and rattle.  Ah, the pacifier, I'm sure.  And just like home stove with sounds, I guess, has parts that the kids could choke on.  Mm-hmm.  Strangulation hazards, Anthony.  Oh.  The water yo-yo balls.  Water yo-yo balls? 
[02:28:00]  Wow, we're out of touch.  What the hell is a water yo-yo ball?  I've never heard of that, but you can strangle yourself with it?  Yes.  What happened was the water yo-yo balls is the toy that they sold in Houston, Texas.  And a woman named Andrea Yates, she puts her children and they bob up and down in the tub like yo-yos.  Bubble, bubble, bubble, up, down, up, down.  That is hazardous.  Then the bubbles stop.  That is very hazardous.  And another strangulation toy is the bungee ruse, whatever that is. 
[02:28:30]  Bungee ruse.  Does that come with a colorful little cowboy hat and boots?  Boots with little taps on them to do a little dance in Colorado?  That could be a choking hazard.  Oh, by the Garrett, little blonde wispy hair is not included. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, my God.  We are never getting less of this.  No.  Oh, come on.  It happened years ago.  Yeah, please.  You can talk about it now.  I didn't tell her to look that good.  There is a problem now with the new Joel Steinberg play toy set that they say that the handcuffs  are hazardous and radiator not included.  Oh, like the little Katie Beers dream house. 
[02:29:30]  Underground dungeon sold separately.  Or the E-Tan Pats hide-and-go-seek game.  Little Adam Walsh bobblehead style.  All right, I'm going home.  Spring sold separately.  Okay. 
[02:30:00]  Maybe I went too far with that one.  God, that is horrible.  I knew that one was going to get out.  Tragedy.  Good news, though, Anthony.  It was sold separately.  The spring.  Torso not included.  Holy shit.  That's awful. 
[02:30:30]  Anthony, this just in.  Booby man from Brooklyn.  Yeah.  A lot of the children's toys are Steve resistant.  So that's good news.  All right.  There you go.  Whoa.  No, this would be really awful right here.  You know you want to joke about that.  Too soon.  Oh, no.  Too soon.  It only happened two days ago.  Here's a little rule in comedy. 
[02:31:00]  You don't make fun of something before the dental records are back.  Oh, no.  Holy crap.  Awful.  What is this?  It's a yo-yo ball.  Oh, the yo-yo balls.  Yeah, it does look dangerous.  Oh, I've seen these things.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like a rubber ball. 
[02:31:30]  My nephew and niece have these.  On the end of a rubber bungee thing that you put on your finger and use like a yo-yo.  These things are actually addicting.  They're kind of cool.  They have soccer balls like this almost.  Do you tie around your waist?  Seriously, I'm not even joking.  And you kick them and they teach you how to kick a soccer ball.  Wouldn't it snap back into your nuts?  It's not necessarily a rubber string.  It's more like a regular.  Oh, got ya.  All right.  Anthony, there's also excessively loud toys.  Oh.  For the little tots that have their ears that are still developing there. 
[02:32:00]  The Barbie Princess musical CD Boombox.  And the Elite Operations M1 Tank from Jeffrey Inc.  A little loud.  And then potentially toxic toys.  There's a couple that made that list.  Hello Kitty Star Glitter Nail Polish.  And Sculpey Ovenbaked Clay.  Oh. 
[02:32:30]  Yes, Jimmy?  He's biting his hands so hard.  Oh, no.  He's trying to control himself.  No way.  No way, he says.  Wow.  He's got a line.  He's got a line.  Just, people, just think of some of the things Jimmy has said on this show.  And there's something in his head right now that he deems too offensive to say.  Just think of how horrific that must be.  Well, I think the listeners want in.  They want to help out the parents out there.  Yes, Nick in Michigan. 
[02:33:00]  I think you forgot to mention one of the hazardous toys.  You forgot the Chai Bang Little Outdoorsman kit.  Watch it out, guys.  I think that's that hunter.  Yeah.  That was what they're shooting as fellow hunters.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would be bad.  Kevin in Boston, what's up?  Yeah, the Station Nightclub playset comes with Steve Boots.  The what?  The Station Nightclub playset comes with Steve Boots.  And a great white CD with it. 
[02:33:30]  All right.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, I guess what we were going to try to do here today was talk about some of the toys  that we grew up with, which were a lot more hazardous than the toys we just mentioned.  The Robert Reed T-cell yo-yo that doesn't come back up.  Just drops.  The little Matthew Eepin baby shakes a lot. 
[02:34:00]  Wow.  British nanny not included.  Oh.  The Connor Peterson father-son fishing game.  Anchor's away soundtrack sold separately. 
[02:34:30]  A little...  Oh.  Is this...  Oh.  Is that...  Oh.  I can't...  No, don't do it.  Is this...  Let me say, you ass.  That is horrible.  I cannot say that.  You wrote this down?  No, I don't say it. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, too soon.  Yeah.  Too soon.  You're right.  Oh, phew.  Rule of comedy.  Don't make fun of things until it stops smoldering.  All right.  My first lava lamp cooking set.  Oh.  Jamie's...  Jamie's little lotion bucket.  Who? 
[02:35:30]  That's the girl that was in the well?  Isn't her name Jamie?  Silence of the Lambs?  No, it was Karen.  Karen, Freddie.  Jamie was...  James Gum.  Jamie Gum was him.  Yeah.  James Gum.  Oh, then I guess it would work for that, too.  Oh, yeah.  The lotion basket.  But he was more Buffalo Bill.  Yeah.  But Jamie, that's the guy who actually knows the movie a lot.  Nice try, Freddie.  Case from Brooklyn.  The Bethany Hamilton surfboard.  Arm not included.  Thank you for that. 
[02:36:00]  Mormon from D.C.  The Christopher Reeve rodeo play set.  I like the Christopher Reeve My Little Pony.  Mikey Biggs from Long Island.  The Shelley Long relationship game.  Pills not included.  That song is so addicting.  The Abu Ghraib Lego people.  You stack them up. 
[02:36:30]  People are horrible.  Let's go to Steve.  Hey, how you guys doing today?  What's up, Steve?  I got one.  Well, actually, I got two.  The first one is the Little Doggy Company's portable radio for children.  Known to cause back strained and herniated discs while moving it from plate to plate.  Very good.  The other one is the Jeffrey Dahmer kitchen set.  Hands not included.  He likes it.  He just laughs at it. 
[02:37:00]  Tony from Chicago.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  You left two gifts off the list there.  The first one is the Joel Steinberg Louisville Slugger.  And the second is Susan Smith Child Safety Seat.  Not bad.  We did both of those references already, but they're not bad.  John from Denver.  John Benet Ramsey dress up in bondage kit.  Oh.  That is rough.  Mike in Allentown. 
[02:37:30]  Hey, how's it going?  Home of the Bear Man.  Yeah, they're on down here.  The one that you guys left out is a Siegfried and Roy lion tamer kit.  I'd like to know who Siegfried and Roy are.  I know.  It's Siegfried.  I have a Siegfried and Roy.  All right, so when we were growing up, the toys were a little dangerous, right?  The Noreen Shatner snorkeling kit. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Can't remember any of the toys that we grew up with anymore, but we're talking about like  lawn darts.  Very dangerous.  Now, they showed some dangerous stuff.  I think those yo-yo things that you just were talking about, that's like a strangling  hazard.  Sure.  Because it's some rubber, I don't know, it's a rubber stretchy thing on the end of it.  It's like a rubber bungee, and on the end of it is a rubber ball.  So I guess if you wrap it around your neck, you could strangle yourself with it. 
[02:38:30]  But it's nothing these days compared to what they used to sell as toys and not recall  as kids.  These things weren't recalled when we were kids.  They were out there for us to play with and be endangered with on a daily basis.  Lawn darts.  Huge, giant darts.  Well, lawn darts, they weren't dangerous until you started making up your own games.  No, because the game itself is dangerous.  It was played like horseshoes.  You had to throw the darts kind of at each other.  You were at opposite ends of the yard.  Or you would stand behind a little circle on the lawn. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Right.  But kind of dangerous.  You know?  But see, we started getting brave and standing in the circle, things like that.  In the circle, throwing them real high in the air so you could barely see where it's  coming down.  Right.  Yeah.  Those are pretty dangerous.  I don't think they make lawn darts anymore.  A lot of kids were impaled by the lawn darts over the years.  Now they make safe lawn darts or something.  It's made out of rubber, the whole thing.  It doesn't have a point on it.  It had a big metal spike that would go like six inches into your skull if it hit you.  The other one, my favorite, click clacks. 
[02:39:30]  Remember those things?  Oh, yeah.  They were glass balls on the end of strings with a little loop to hold on to.  And what you would do is kind of tick, tick, tick, tick, tick them together, get them going,  and then really start wailing so they meet at the top and the bottom.  And they would just sometimes explode, sending shrapnel like you were in the NAMM, like a  claymore went off.  Or you would smash the side of your head, too. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  If you did them wrong, you could smash yourself in the temple with it.  One I used to love was a super elastic bubble plastic.  Remember super elastic bubble plastic?  Yeah.  You blew like bubbles or something?  Yeah.  You blew these big bubbles.  It came with a tube, this lead tube, like a toothpaste tube, full of this chemical that  I'm sure was just the most toxic stuff ever.  And you would put a blob of it on the end of a straw and then blow into the straw.  And it would blow this big balloon thing up made of super elastic bubble plastic. 
[02:40:30]  The problem was when you were blowing into it, it was fine and dandy.  But if you inhaled, like you took a breath to blow more air in, and some of the air that  was already in this toxic plastic balloon went back into your lungs, could be a problem.  You'd start hacking like you had tuberculosis.  And God knows what kind of disease you'd get from it.  Because it was something from DuPont Chemical, I believe, put it out. 
[02:41:00]  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember reading about it.  I wonder why that's not around anymore.  Highly toxic.  But kids would...  What kind of cancer is that causing?  I remember a kid down the block would chew on it like bubble gum.  Holy crap.  He'd chew on it.  Super elastic bubble plastic.  And then there was Incredible Edibles.  What was that again?  That was...  They would give you this big monster factory, or a bug factory it was called. 
[02:41:30]  And you would take these metal plates and put this goop, they called it goop, in it.  And then you'd slide it in.  It was almost like a miniature Easy Bake Oven kind of thing.  But it would use metal coils to heat this thing up to a billion degrees or so.  And then they'd give you this metal clamp that you would precariously put in the plate and pull it out.  Now you're holding pretty much a branding iron on a six-inch fork.  And if it would touch, which it would all the time, touch your hands, you'd smell burning flesh, 
[02:42:00]  and you'd have these angled metal burn marks in your hands.  This was a toy for kids.  It plugged in, it was hot, and then the bubbling little goop that you put in would cool down, and you'd have a bug.  It was like this plastic bug, but you could eat it.  And when you ran out of the goop, you started melting your crayons, right?  Crayons, yeah, and putting those in there.  Because the oven got so hot, it would melt anything.  But you were supposed to eat this stuff, and you never knew what it was.  The goop came in these plastic tubes.  Again, some kind of chemical that solidified after you heated it and let it cool. 
[02:42:30]  And then you'd eat it.  Look, I'm eating a bug.  You had a lot of edible stuff when you were a kid, and you just didn't know what the hell it was.  Chris from Jersey, what's up?  Yo, man, what's going on, guys?  Hello, sweetie, Norton.  Hi, fella.  Welcome to the radio program.  I hear you.  The worst toy, and they still fucking make it, is that light bright.  You know what I'm talking about?  It was like a white box, and it came with like a billion and one little plastic pegs, perfect for choking on. 
[02:43:00]  And then you put the little frame over it, like the little plastic paper thing, and you poke the pegs through it, and they light up.  Because this thing lights up with a bulb that gets to be about 9,000 degrees.  And they still make it.  It's still in the stores.  I can't believe they haven't pulled it.  You go to Toys R Us, it's there.  Light bright, making things with light.  Right.  That was the song.  That's the one.  Yeah, you'd put in these little, and I'm sure those are a choking hazard, those little pegs.  Yep.  And you'd put them in the various colors, and it would, that's a little dangerous. 
[02:43:30]  David from Jersey.  What's up, David?  A lot of calls from Jersey today.  Hey, David.  How you doing?  You stuck.  Thanks.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Okay.  I got two.  I got two for you guys.  It's NYU base jumping kit.  Not bad.  And the Chandra Levy hide and seek, and seek, and seek, and seek.  I thought you were just stuttering.  Very good.  Nice.  Hey, that's good.  All right.  You rock, man.  Thanks, fella.  All right. 
[02:44:00]  Charlie from Newark.  What's up, Charlie?  What's up, all of you guys?  What's going on?  You forgot a game.  Huh?  The Christy Alley Hungry Hippo Game.  Hungry, hungry, Christy.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Greg from Kansas.  You hit her on the back, and her fat mouth opens, and grabs something, and pulls it back in.  You punch the small of her fat spine.  Greg, what's up?  Hey, they still sell that plastic bubble stuff down here. 
[02:44:30]  They've got a safety mechanism on the straw, where it only blows one weight, where you can't inhale it.  Oh, you can't inhale it anymore?  Right.  They put a little one-way check valve in the straw?  Yeah, great.  Of course they still sell it in Kansas.  No, it's in Texas.  What?  Texas, I think.  Oh, Texas?  Oh, I said Kansas on the line.  Oh, I said.  All right.  That'll stop you from getting a jack-in-the-box trauma on your brains out that way.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dan.  Hey, Dan, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Dan from Jersey.  I got another toy for you. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Michael J. Fox, Bobblehead.  Nice.  Horrible.  And cut.  Michael J. Fox would be a fine Etch-A-Sketch.  Although not when making the picture, but like, I'm finished with this.  Hold this for a second.  What are you doing?  I was just showing it to you.  Oh, Shuck-A, Shuck-A, Shuck-A, Shuck-A.  Try to show him your Etch-A-Sketch, and he just ruins it.  Shrinky Dinks. 
[02:45:30]  That's right.  Remember the Shrinky Dinks?  Oh, yeah.  You'd take these little things.  You'd cut them out of plastic and put them in your oven.  You'd color them in.  Put them in the oven on a cookie sheet and bake them, and they would shrink and turn into glass.  But sometimes they would explode, and you'd get this Shrinky Dink explosion, which would leave little glass shards inside your oven.  It would cause fires.  Mm-hmm.  Remember Digger the dog?  Digging, he goes with you when you explore.  Just pull his leash. 
[02:46:00]  He's your dog for sure.  It was this awful plastic dog.  You'd just walk it.  It would just go, ow, ow, ow, ow, and it just sucked.  I guess it sold.  You got the worst toys growing up.  I didn't get that, though.  It's just a little puppy you could pet.  Megan Kang is sold separately.  That is really awful.  Jim from Center Reach.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  How about the Rock'em Sock'em Master Pobots? 
[02:46:30]  We're moving on from the Master Poe thing.  Please do me a favor and move on from that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  I used to get beat with the Hot Wheel Track.  Hot Wheel Track, yeah.  Yeah, that was the other thing growing up.  The parents would use their own toys to beat us up.  How degrading is that?  I definitely got some spankings with the Hot Wheel Track.  Hot Wheel Track, that orange length, that three-foot length of track.  Upper legs, wham.  They could leave two different welts. 
[02:47:00]  The bottom welt, which would give you the little notch that you used to put the little tongue in to stick the tracks together.  Or they'd turn it upside down where you get the two thin rails.  From the top of the track, which would leave two really nice welts.  Looked like cuts.  I liked color forms when I was a boy.  Another dangerous choking hazard.  I would smell them, though.  The plastic always smelled good when you first opened them.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that.  You'd peel back the color form. 
[02:47:30]  I'm weird with that.  The smell of a brand new set of color forms.  Fantastic.  That was very nice.  When you smell new books, right?  You've got to smell a new book, especially with shiny pages.  I'll smell one.  I always hate when my face leaves grease on the page.  But do you ever only smell the page once?  I can't smell it more than once, or I feel like the smell is gone.  It is.  Right?  Like the little dittos you'd get in school, when they'd take one and hand it back, hand  the pile back, and you'd smell it.  Yeah.  But then, alas, it was gone in a second. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Once you smelled it.  Yeah.  Dittos.  I used to smell it.  We so need to take a break.  Why would you...  Who's on the hotline?  Someone's calling it.  Oh, the Mabel King jump rope.  Or you could pick up the Rich Voss speak and spell.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Mabel King jump rope. 
[02:48:30]  That's a good one.  Who's on the hotline, Oak?  I don't know.  I'm still waiting.  Who?  Big Kev.  Hey, Big Kev.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  You guys didn't talk about BB guns or disc guns or...  Yeah, those were toys as a kid.  They would give you BB guns.  You can't get a BB gun anymore.  Well, you can't just go in and buy one.  You know, like a kid can't go in and buy one. 
[02:49:00]  You have to have an adult with you.  Exactly.  But as a kid, you used to be able to just go in and buy a BB gun.  Go in into the woods, kill everything, shoot your friends.  How old were you when you got your first gun, Anthony?  First gun?  12?  12 or 13.  Yeah.  Pistol.  Got a .22 pistol.  They once bought me a rubber band gun.  Ooh.  I know.  That's badass.  They had different childhoods, I'll tell you.  I said, give me the Gat. 
[02:49:30]  Let me show you where it's at.  I was only allowed to shoot it in the backyard by myself.  Hmm.  That was a lot of fun.  Shoot it in the backyard by yourself and it was a rubber band gun?  It was a rubber band, like, rifle.  So, you know, you stretch the rubber bands, you know, far enough back.  And you were told to, hey, now be careful with this.  Oh, yeah.  Rubber bands were talking.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oof.  And then there was a mechanism where the rubber bands would stretch even more after you got it loaded.  So, they would go pretty far.  Oh, I bet.  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  Wow, that sounds quite dangerous.  I never heard of something that could work as a weapon and also help ponytails stay in place.  All right, Kev.  Thank you.  See you.  Bye.  The Reginald Denny pinata set.  Wow.  Hey, guys.  Let's say hi to Bob Kelly.  Bob.  Bob.  Bobby.  Bob.  Bob.  What's up?  What's up?  Hi, fella.  Can you hear us?  Hello.  Hello.  Bob, can you hear us?  Yeah, I can hear.  Are you guys fucking with me with that whole thing? 
[02:50:30]  No, no.  We're actually not.  We're not.  We're actually out of time with the phones.  The phones have had problems all day.  Yeah, what's up, man?  Colin was in the other day, and he was telling us a story about you and Seinfeld, and it was  a little embarrassing.  Yeah, that friggin' son of a bitch Seinfeld douchebag.  Would you like to tell us the story?  Yeah, I feel like I'm on The Tonight Show right now.  Yeah, Johnny. 
[02:51:00]  Norton's Ed.  I don't want to be Ed.  I want to be Doc.  Take one up the keister.  Is he gay?  I, uh...  He always seemed a little flamboyant.  Seemed a little Noah-like.  Remember when he was filming Comedian?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he was...  That son of a bitch was coming down with this little camera crew, and I never talked to  him.  I never said nothing to him.  I never say nothing to famous people when they come down there.  And there's certain comedians... 
[02:51:30]  We're talking about the comics, by the way, where most of that movie Comedian was filled.  Yes.  Thank you.  Where all the big-time New York comics hang out when they're not on the road.  Right.  All right, there you go.  Sorry.  Thanks.  So, this son of a bitch comes down.  I never said nothing to him.  I just...  You know, some comedians kiss their asses, you know.  Yeah.  Especially if he was filming, so there were certain comedians, Godfrey, that were just,  you know, sticking their faces in.  And I never said nothing to him. 
[02:52:00]  One night, he says something to me.  I say something back.  I feel like we build up a rapport.  Rapport?  You know what I mean?  What did he say?  Excuse me?  Yeah.  What's the code?  Because there's a door code to get down.  Is this seat taken?  Well, you know, it was kind of like a little conversation we had.  Yeah.  So, the next day...  What was it about, Bob?  Was it something like...  All right, so it wasn't that much of a conversation, but it was enough for me to maybe say hi to  him again. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  He said...  Did he ask why you were looking at that midget and crying?  Ooh.  Is that the first time he's done it?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  All right.  What is that?  I'll never live that down.  No.  You won't.  And you wonder why I fuck sinks.  So, I went and I did this gig up in Buffalo two days later. 
[02:53:00]  The worst gig of my life.  I have to hire my own driver to pick me up to drive me to the gig.  This guy picks me up in a van, one of those, you know, one of those, you know, cool vans  with the captain seats and the TV and the, you know, VCR.  Nice.  So, he's got every Seinfeld episode ever, ever, ever, ever, and he's got headphones on and  he's not watching and he's listening to them.  Jesus.  This guy's a Seinfeld freak. 
[02:53:30]  So, we go, we're driving to the gig.  He's telling me about Seinfeld.  He finds out I'm a comedian.  He starts calling me Jerry.  Oh, jeez.  Oh.  I took him up to, we went to lunch, you know, because we had like an hour to kill.  Yeah.  So, the whole time he's telling me about, you know, his family and he's, you know, he's  like Jerry and I'm like Bob.  He's like, oh, I know, but I just really like Jerry.  So, I'm like, okay, call me Jerry.  Oh, my God.  That's weird.  Did he ask you to listen to an audio cassette of his stand-up and put you on his show?  Jerry. 
[02:54:00]  Jerry.  So.  Ma.  Nice talking to you.  So, this guy, this guy asked me for an autograph, but, you know, I was like, you know what?  I might be able to get you one because I just talked to him the other night for the first  time, me and my new buddy.  Yeah.  So, then I go to do this gig.  It's outside, after a band, in the rain, in the afternoon, next to a skydiving simulator 
[02:54:30]  at a beer fest.  So, how was the gig?  It was all right.  It wasn't that bad.  You pulled it off.  So, this gig was hell.  So, I go back to New York.  I met this guy.  I mean, I lived this Seinfeld episode.  Yeah.  This guy, the whole gig with the thing and the flight simulator.  I can't wait to see Jerry and tell him the gig, you know, tell him about the gig.  So, the first time we talked, we made a bet. 
[02:55:00]  I was making bets and he jumped in on the bet.  So, I owed him a buck because he won the bet.  That's why that was our conversation.  Oh, okay.  So, he's on stage.  Do you remember what the bet was?  Yeah.  It was if Gretzky was on the team that when the Rangers won the Stanley Cup.  And no, he wasn't.  All right.  And so, he walks off stage and I got my dollar out and there's like a crowd of people going  nuts.  He walks by me at the foot of the stairs in the cellar and I go, here's your buck. 
[02:55:30]  You won the bet.  And he looks at me with like, I almost think that, you know, he could smell dog shit, but  he doesn't know where it is.  Look.  And he took the buck, which kind of annoyed me that he took the buck.  Of course.  And he didn't say nuts.  All right.  Don't worry about it.  He took it.  Yeah.  I go, but I got a story for you first.  He goes, you want your buck back?  So, in my head, I'm like, what a fucking dick.  And he walks up two stairs.  He turns around and he goes, I'll be upstairs in the back corner eating. 
[02:56:00]  So, when you're done, come up and we'll talk upstairs.  So, I go, all right, man.  I'll be up.  I'm doing my set.  Right after my set, I'll come up.  We'll sit.  We'll talk.  He goes, not you.  He was talking to the lady next to me.  I was so, you understand, there was a crowd of people there. 
[02:56:30]  The lady next to me looked at me like, I'm sorry.  And then he just walked up the stairs.  How embarrassing.  Oh, for that split second, you're like, oh, my God, Jerry's inviting me up to his table.  I'm going to hang.  And that, not you.  It was just the fact that I assumed that he would invite me from two sentences to sitting  down and having food with the guy.  Right.  And I'm like, yeah, I'll be right.  I said it so confident, too. 
[02:57:00]  I was like, good, I've got to do my set.  But right when I'm done with my set, I'll be up and I'll join you.  And then we'll talk about stories.  I've got to do my craft.  Not you, in that Jew voice.  That, his just big, fat lips.  Just not you.  That's a good story, man.  Oh, that rings through my head.  Oh, of course it does.  If someone says, not you, it rings through my fucking head.  You know how embarrassing it is when you're walking down the street and someone waves 
[02:57:30]  and goes, hey.  And you wave back and then you realize it's somebody behind you that they're waving at.  That's the worst feeling.  And you're all embarrassed.  Obviously, yeah.  It's got to be that times a thousand.  It's Jerry Seinfeld.  And you're in front of people.  And that is the worst.  When Colin told me that, I couldn't stop laughing and feeling bad for you.  I cried like you at a midget wedding.  Dude, I, let me tell you something. 
[02:58:00]  I, in my head, in like a split second, I literally saw myself being on his new show.  See?  I'm the new Kramer and I was just a superstar.  For a split second, like.  Colin, Colin, just blowing him off.  Jerry's inviting me to his table.  This is great.  All right, I'll be up right after I do my set.  I finally made it.  So, like Jerry will tell people about Bob, like, oh, you've got to sit and talk to this guy.  He's out of his mind.  He's crazy.  Yeah.  Bob, they've offered me a show and I need a help. 
[02:58:30]  I need a writer.  Just like Larry was on Seinfeld.  I'd like you to be on this new project I'm working on.  Yeah, we need a professional person who knows about eating ass and all those.  And effing sinks.  Maybe you can be the tear Nazi.  The tear Nazi.  People come in with a sad story and you just cry and they walk out of your establishment.  God forbid I show emotion to a little girl who can't touch her face.  Little girl? 
[02:59:00]  She was a woman.  Just happened to be a two foot tall.  We finally got the audio of that.  We're going to play it after the break, by the way.  Finally.  We've been looking for that audio for weeks.  All right, Bob.  We're going to let you go.  We might call you back because I think we're going to play the midget audio as well today.  All right, guys.  I love all you guys.  You're the best, Bob.  Not you.  See you, man.  Bye.  Bye.  There he goes.  Bob Kelly.  Is that just an embarrassing story?  That's great.  Like he's looking up the stairs at Jerry looking down at you. 
[02:59:30]  He says, when you're done, come on up.  We'll eat and talk.  And for that split, because you know, as a comic, he's standing there going, this is great.  Oh, my God.  What an in.  You know, if you're going to network with a comedian, Seinfeld's the guy that you want to network with.  The guy, you know, took stand-up comedy and turned it into what every stand-up comic wants.  The most successful sitcom in history, you know.  And there he is, ready to go.  All the fantasies rushing through Bob's head. 
[03:00:00]  And, oh, yeah, I'm going to do this.  I'm going to tell.  The friends he's going to tell.  He's thinking about the friends he's going to tell that he hung out with Jerry.  And he invited him up to his table.  And the comedians that will see him walking in.  Right.  Like we're all walking in.  And there's Bob at Seinfeld's table chatting, having some fun.  Chatting away.  Jerry throwing his head back.  Ha, ha, ha.  Laughing at Bob's banter.  Bob.  And Bob going, dude, I just can't do it.  I can't give you six weeks, Jerry.  I can't.  It's impossible.  It's impossible. 
[03:00:30]  And then in that split second, in that split second, not you.  Because the comedy cellar, when you walk out of the showroom, you can make a right to leave  or the steps up to the left will take you up to the olive tree.  And it's very cramped.  Yeah.  And everybody, if Seinfeld was speaking, everybody is silently listening.  Of course.  Everyone heard it.  What a wonderfully horrible story.  Oh, dude, it's just awful.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony. 
[03:01:00]  Ah, you son of a bitch!  Worst, worst, worst, worst of Opie and Anthony.  Ugh.  I wouldn't order this shit, either.  You suck.  Rock.  And we got Shannon.  We're calling her?  Author of The Best You'll Ever Have.  What Every Woman Should Know About Getting and Giving. 
[03:01:30]  Knock Your Socks Off Sex.  So is it going to be the whole, hi guys, how you doing?  The perky, very up.  I think she'll be very business-like.  You think?  Yes.  I think they'd have to be like, hi.  Well, this book is going to teach everyone what they really need to know to spice it up  in the bed to shut up.  How many copies of the book do we have, Ben?  Just one.  That's good.  Yeah.  Let one person peruse it.  Oh my God, you know what? 
[03:02:00]  I love this new bit.  It's a Jimmy bit.  It's hearing the pages.  Yeah.  I want to.  I do love that bit.  I love this bit.  They don't understand what's going on.  Oh, oh, oh.  Thanks, buddy.  Yes.  Oh, wait.  Jimmy, can I have that book?  I think we have our sexpert on the line here.  Let me just, I'm just perusing the Sharon and Mullen.  Cool.  Hold on.  I got to see the book.  All right.  No, I don't.  We're trying to get her on the phone right now.  All right.  But this is a little, like a one sheet on the best you'll ever have. 
[03:02:30]  What every woman should know about getting and giving Knock Your Socks Love Sex by Shannon  Mull.  Here you go.  This is the picture.  And I do believe we have her on the line.  And it's Shannon Mullin, right, Shannon?  Yep.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Welcome to the program.  Hi.  Thanks for having me on.  Oh, no problem.  When we found out that we were going to have you on the show, we got quite excited.  Oh, yeah.  We really did.  We love sex.  LOL.  Who doesn't is right, you know?  So what's going on there, Shannon? 
[03:03:00]  Not much.  The book is called The Best You'll Ever Have.  Yep.  With a very, very long subtitle.  Well, can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  Hi, this is Connor.  It's myth number one.  You have a section here on sexual myths?  Uh-huh.  What is this about?  Tush sex is for gay men.  Yeah, that's a big myth.  Oh, I think you were saying that it was...  Oh, that's a myth.  Hold on.  Yeah, that's a myth. 
[03:03:30]  I thought you were saying that it was actually only for gay men.  No, no, that would be part of the myth list.  Oh, so that's something that is a knock-your-socks-off type of sex?  Yeah, that's actually something that I think people ought to talk about more.  For women, they think, well, why would I want something up my butt when I have a perfectly  good vagina?  Right, exactly.  Especially if you're going to hit logs.  Yeah, so you have to kind of think it through and think why that makes sense in order to  convince yourself to give it a go. 
[03:04:00]  And why does that make sense?  And why does it make sense there, Shannon?  It makes sense for women because there's a muscle called the PC muscle that goes from  your pubic bone to your tailbone, like a hammock.  Uh-huh.  And all of that muscle is filled with nerve endings.  Every human being who has an orgasm has their butt twitch.  You know?  It's all connected.  Anthony and I have this thing, though.  We think butt sex should be left for the young.  How old is too old to have butt sex?  Right. 
[03:04:30]  For the young only.  You're a bit saucy  You're a bit saucy for our program  But that's okay  There's actually a good line here too  This is pretty funny  It's about the G-spot  And it says here  The search party  Hold on, what page is this?  It says  Break out the rubber gloves  Kidding  About looking for the G-spot  Now, hold on  This is page 51  Yeah  Is that a problem  That most men have? 
[03:05:00]  Finding the G-spot?  That's a problem  Most women have too  So where is this?  Really?  So where is this G-spot?  Yeah, I'll tell you  Because I finally came up  With a way to explain it  That I think is pretty simple  There's a picture in the book  That you can't misunderstand  What page?  What page?  Yeah, what?  There's two pictures in a row  Let me just flip through  Oh, hold on  I got it right here  There's one with a finger  With a finger  I have page  I have page 49  It's a diagram of the G-spot  Is that it?  That's right  49 and 53 
[03:05:30]  Oh, two pages  Hold on  You should look at 49  Then you'll look at  Let me get 49  Hold on  Alright  So we show it first  Like in relationship  To what everyone knows  Everyone knows  The uterus and the ovary  Right  Because we had that in school  So if you can explain anything  You have to show that  Uh-huh  It says here the G-spot  It also has a picture of the bladder  Yes  Exactly  The bladder  Because at least  We totally know that  In our heads  Not much  Right  And for women  The only thing they really remember  Is the tampon diagram 
[03:06:00]  True that  Oh, yeah  Every box of tampons  Comes with one of those  Who doesn't know that?  But that diagram sucks  So how do you find the G-spot?  You shove a couple fingers in there  And then what do you do?  Well, I would start with just one  Just one  Shock  That's true  You don't need to lose  Your babysitting job right away  You can reserve the rest of the hand  For other activities  Right, right, right  So through that  The motion is the come-hither motion  Yeah  Come over here  Yeah  So when you're doing that  Stop halfway through  And take a look at your hand from the side 
[03:06:30]  And you'll see you're in like a perfect C shape  Uh, yeah  A perfect C shape  It's like two and a half inches in  Toward the belly button, right?  It's towards the belly button side  And it's very, like you said  Like two and a half inches  It's the bottom one-third  So it's not very far in  And if you press on the pubic bone  Which is really the base of your jeans zipper  Everyone has a pubic group  Yes, we do  But behind the pubic bone for women  Is the G spot  So you try to get behind that bone  It's quite spongy, right?  It is 
[03:07:00]  It's like a ridgy, spongy  It's erectile tissue  So if she's in the right frame of mind  The G spot's there  And you can see it  And if she's not in the right frame of mind  If she's nervous or uptight  And just not ready yet  It won't really be very prominent  And the main thing for women is  They've felt it here and there  But it makes them nervous  Because it makes them feel like they're going to pee  Oh, really?  So a lot of times they'll feel it  And they'll seize up and stop everything  Instead of knowing they're not going to pee  Being able to relax  Women tend to lose the best orgasm to fear of pain 
[03:07:30]  I like to call that G spot  Connor's headrest  Headrest?  Yeah, our old Connor here in the studio  I know  I always  I'm afraid to go swimming though  I am  I  The book here  Now, are you actually  Is it released yet?  Yeah, it just came out  Oh  Time for Christmas  Where can you get it?  Barnes & Noble  Amazon  I think your local bookstores carry it  Yeah  Um  Hold on 
[03:08:00]  What, what  There's Twitch talk  There's actually  I'll say one thing  I like the  There's a tremendous amount of like little headings  At the top of every  Every page  So it's kind of like  Almost like a food for thought type of book  Oh  Like, you know what I mean?  Like you want to go out and go fishing or something with your mom  And you know, if you're going to go fishing  Maybe only one comes back and two don't  Right  How about here?  It's just don't hate  Masturbate  Oh  That's a pretty good story  I got  What's that about?  Well, I started this business called Safina 
[03:08:30]  Right  About two years ago  And um  Safina is these in-home sex ed salons  And we sell sex toys  Oh  Oh  We call them sexories  Accessories for your lost life  Sexories  Like accessories  But only  But only  Uh  Sex  Right  I get it  Right  Accessories for your lost life  I mean the whole thing about  You're brilliant  In America  Is still  It's very awkward and uncomfortable  Like tush talk 
[03:09:00]  I mean the reason we call it that  Is so you can actually talk about your butt  Without feeling like a weird person  Without feeling dirty  Well no one wants to listen to their tush  Plus it's breath stinks  Ha ha ha ha ha  Yeah  Ha ha ha ha ha  All right  Oh  All right  Well what else do you cover that could help us out in the bedroom  Well  Sex toys are something that almost every woman is interested in  But they need permission to like them  So if you're married or you're in a long term relationship  You really should get some 
[03:09:30]  But make sure they're attractive  Don't buy ugly things  Um  Sharon  What's the difference between a clit and a penis  Oh that's a good question  What page is that  I'm sorry to interrupt you Sharon  What page is that  Let's see  That's in the second chapter  Uh  Connor wants to follow along in his own book  Yes  Like he followed along his mom  To those depths of  Well  That's good  It starts off  Uh  Explaining kind of where the clitoris is  And what is  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  I'm looking for the diagram 
[03:10:00]  There's a great diagram  Of the difference between a clitoris and a penis  Oh  What page  I'm sorry  I didn't mean to interrupt  What page  I'm trying to follow along the book here  Still looking for  Okay here's a good page  Hold on  I gotta think  Ninety-four  Hold on  The cover keeps falling off  Hold on  All right  Ninety-four  We're at page ninety-four here  All right  You'll be surprised  At how similar the clitoris and the penis are  Really  In fact they're almost exactly the same  Well if they're on Jamie Lee Curtis they are  Yeah  Even on your most average woman 
[03:10:30]  Well Susan obviously there's a difference in size though  I don't have a page here  There is a big difference in size  But they operate exactly the same way  You know everyone starts off female  This I thought was very surprising when I started this research  At the seventh week if you've got a Y chromosome  Your vulva closes up and it becomes testicles and the clitoris grows  Oh  So everyone starts off the same  So we actually have all the same exact stuff  And the clitoris operates exactly the same as the penis 
[03:11:00]  So when blood rushes to the region  Yes  The clitoris raises up and gets erect and sticks out from its foreskin  How did you learn all this?  This took me about a year and a half  That's it?  Well that's all I did  I've interviewed doctors, urologists, dominatrixes  You know people who know things  Real  Let me ask you a question  Right here I'm looking at page 150  It says  I've never had an orgasm  Yeah 
[03:11:30]  These are stories of real women  Why are you laughing at that?  Some girls don't have an orgasm  I don't believe that  A lot of people  Yeah exactly  A lot  I would say no less than 10%  My dad and mom would always fight  And she would always  My mom and I were talking one time  I actually just heard the fight from inside the little womb I was staying in  That day  Like she would never have orgasms  Right  I mean I heard this  It was kind of embarrassing as a kid to hear that  But it's like I think times have changed now  Well I think men are more in tune with making a woman have an orgasm  Am I right or wrong?  See Connor's very interested in your book 
[03:12:00]  And learning all he can  I mean I just know he's soaking up every bit of information he can  And just tearing through it  That's good  That means he's actually interested in women  That's good  Oh yeah  Oh I am  I'm very attached to my mother  I think everyone's with me  You know  Because this orgasm thing is not a small problem  I mean when I say 10%  I think I'm being conservative  Wow  Wow  Safina  So Safina  What kind of advice could you give to the ladies that don't get the orgasms there?  Yeah  Orgasms really do start in mind 
[03:12:30]  So it's very very important  Just relax  Just relax  And that's  Most of the time if you haven't had an orgasm by the time you're in your 20s you're pretty frustrated  Can't you just get them really  Can't you get them just really drunk?  Will that help?  Oh what about alcohol?  It really can't hurt  I mean as long as you're not doing anything related to the butt  Let me ask you  You should never be drunk or high  That's a really bad idea  Never be drunk or high for the butt  That's the only way I can take it  Is tush sex bad for you? 
[03:13:00]  No  That's another myth  Shut up  Yeah  Because people think  Wow  You know that doesn't seem like it ought to happen  Because in our culture it seems so bad  Yeah  And they think  Well what if I get all stretched out of shape and I'm in pain  Yeah  Right  If it's done properly  With lots of lube and going very slowly  Right  Yeah  It's just another muscle you're exercising  But if she's crying and saying no  Yeah then you probably better quit  Right by 10  Really?  Should you stop or should you put the diaper back on? 
[03:13:30]  Absolutely  I know he's being silly  Yeah  Oh Connor  Sarah  Sarah?  No Shannon  Oh Shannon  Opie  Tafina is the company and Shannon is the team  Oh I'm sorry  That's okay  I've been calling you up  Amber was the mistress  Let's see  The male G spot  Equals the P spot  Yeah  P dash  P dash spot  What does that mean?  The P spot is pretty interesting 
[03:14:00]  Because like I was saying  The clitoris and the penis are the same  Well men have a G spot too of course  Because we have all the same stuff  It just moves around  So you know where the G spot is right behind the pubic bone  And you make this come hither motion  The P spot is just a little further back  And it's on the back side of the prostate  So you're saying that men and women are pretty much the same  Before we were born  But it's just some type of a chromosome  Yeah  All right  And so everything just shifts around  Yeah  But what makes women a little bit smarter than we are? 
[03:14:30]  Oh Connor  They sure are  They sure are  We know who the boss at home is  Unless you have a motor and a boat  Then we teach you  Wow  Yeah one little blonde hair in the front seat  Dad didn't think  Okay  I do have a theory about happiness  I'd love to try out on you  Oh  Oh  Little experiment  I don't know if you agree  Well hold on  Okay  Here's my theory 
[03:15:00]  All right  The reason why I focus on women with Safina  And getting them to buy sex toys  Turn up  Is because I think that  If women think something's a good idea  And then we can all do it  Yeah  Because if women are having fun  Then we can all have fun  Right  So my theory is that women are in control of the fun  And that women can still have fun  Yeah  What do you think?  I have to agree with you  I think you're right  Yeah  Yeah 
[03:15:30]  You seem to have culled a lot of knowledge  From a lot of people  And put it together  Very nicely in this book  Well thanks  What have you learned on your own  Through your own sexual experiences?  Wow  A lot  I think I've learned a lot  Well I found  This is really distracting  What's that?  The kazoo is really distracting  Jews are distracting?  Is that the kazoo?  Kazoo?  What are you talking about? 
[03:16:00]  Something must be bleeding through  I don't know what you're talking about  Oh okay  I was hearing this Christmas music  We were having  Christmas music?  No  Actually we don't play Christmas music on our show  Never  Yeah because we figure all the other radio stations are doing that  So I don't know  Okay that's good  Okay  I don't know what that was  We had some equipment problems earlier  And we do apologize for that  Oh that's okay  I'm Shannon  If something was bleeding through  From a production facility  I'm going to sweep this up your ass  But I pooped from there 
[03:16:30]  I found my G-spot  And I lost it  And I found it again  You did?  Yeah I lost it for like seven years  Wow  Where'd you lose it?  You lost your G-spot?  Yeah I actually thought it was attached to this guy I was dating  And when we broke up  You know I thought  Wow  That was so great  I really  For seven years?  Yeah  Now nobody else was able to find it  Seven years  It was horrible  G-spot doesn't work  Breaking a mirror  And then having bad luck  You know  Yeah  So I found my G-spot 
[03:17:00]  Because  I finally found another guy  Who could find it  And then I realized  It wasn't attached to him  Where was it?  Was it at the mall?  Oh girl  It was under the couch  Pushing  Oh Connor  Oh my  She's buried  Jiminy Cricket  Oh boy  Alright  Well listeners  Listeners have a few questions I think  Right?  Great  Yeah they're very excited to talk to a  Sexpert  A sexpert right  Do you call yourself a sexpert? 
[03:17:30]  What is your title?  I'm a sexpert now  I'm actually the new sexpert for iVillage  So I'm a real sexpert now  What is iVillage?  iVillage is a women's website  It's like a kind of compilation of magazine articles  From Cosmo  And all the major magazines  And health issues  And sex  Alright  Alright let's go to Ken  And  Hold on a minute  Let's go to Ken  In Virginia  Stop it  Or you will not get your snorkel  And flippers for Christmas 
[03:18:00]  Ken?  Yes sir  Do you have a question  For the sexpert?  Absolutely  A couple of months ago  Little Connor  Was looking a whore's ass  And he came down  With a cold afterwards  And I was wondering  If she found anything in her research  That correlates the two  Oh yeah  That is true  Connor  I was performing Tushalingus  Yeah  Tushalingus and got a cold  And he got a cold  I got a cold  This is a true story  Yes  Is that possible Shannon?  That's more than possible  But I don't know if it's related  Okay  Huh 
[03:18:30]  But if you only got a cold  You're lucky  Well you can't get anything from that  It can't happen to me  Alright  Oh boy  We're all having a bit  Oh gosh  What can you get from Tushalingus?  Herpes is transmittable  No it's not  From mouth to butt  Or anywhere  Is he eating logs bad?  I think you get something called  Stinkiest Tongiest 
[03:19:00]  You know  Stink  I'm going to call  You got us easy  You could have gotten something bad  Alright  Why don't we say hi to Chris on Long Island  Chris you got a question?  Hi  Good morning guys  How are you?  Good  Morning Chris  Welcome to the program  Thanks  Hi Shannon  Hi  Hi  I just want to let you know  That my wife has read a couple of books  By Miss Frankel  She's a huge fan  She's great isn't she?  Yeah  Yeah  And I have a question for you  You were talking about these successories  And a friend suggested something 
[03:19:30]  I wanted to know  My wife's teetering  Maybe I can push her over the edge  How do you feel about  I'd like her to  Defecate  On a plate  Preferably  On a plate?  Yeah  And then you know  Maybe she could microwave it  And when it gets nice and hot  Run around the house  With it yelling donkey sausage  Have you heard of this before?  This donkey sausage phenomenon?  No  No what's that?  Oh well it's this new thing  And it's really great 
[03:20:00]  You just run around with a plate  Full of  You know  Hot steaming defecation  Running around yelling donkey sausage  Donkey sausage  You know  And it's supposedly a great turn on  But my wife hasn't  You know  She's kind of on the edge  She doesn't want to try it  Well that's a good question  Shannon  Donkey sausage  Yay or nay?  Well you have to think of  To get anyone to do anything  Especially with sex  You have to think  What's in it for them  Right  So now why is that going to be fun for her?  You have to figure something out  Shut up 
[03:20:30]  Shut up  Shut up  I think you have to come up with a reason  Why that's going to be fun  Right  For her  Well that's a great question  I think it's some type of fetish thing  He was into  Yeah like if he wants to put down  Plastic bags on the floor  And maybe have someone come over  This afternoon at 5.30  And you know  Drop logs on  Drop a few logs  Right  3.50  Alright let's go to Eric in Manhattan  Eric you have a question?  Yes I do  Alright  Quite often I have sex with my wife  In a balloon nut  Yeah  And when I pull out  I have a little surprise  Is that safe 
[03:21:00]  And how do I clean that?  I think what he's saying is  He pulled his  Does it say it right?  It's tush sex  And he pulled it out  And it looked like his mule  Was wearing an Abe Lincoln hat  Oh yeah  Old gravy leg  Right  Well one thing for sure  It feels like she's got to go to the bathroom  She does  So she ought to consider that  Before you start  Because that's  You know  It's really not a holding area  Right  Right  It's not a holding area  No  So there really should be  Almost nothing in there 
[03:21:30]  Yeah  Under normal conditions  So you should probably ask that  Okay  In advance  Alright  That's some good advice  I must say  Good question  Serious questions  Only from our listeners  Yeah who's this now?  Vivid Empire  Hey what's up?  Hi  I want to know  I want to know if this is considered  A glass coffee table book  And what is the best way  To introduce scat to the woman?  Is this considered a coffee table book?  No  A glass coffee table book  A glass coffee table book  A glass coffee table book 
[03:22:00]  You can lay under it and read it  Right  While listening to it  Yeah it's not big enough  Chuck Berry records  It's one of the big books  So I don't know  But it is  It does have like a really cheerful  Chicklet looking cover  Right  So you could read it on the subway  And nobody's going to think of anything  Yeah  And what was the second part  Of your question?  Yeah what was the second part?  What's the best way to introduce scat  To my wife?  Scat  Scat  Like the old singing?  That's what I think  I don't know  My chest is a 
[03:22:30]  Old gravy chest  Old gravy chest  Oh  You know  Oh  You know having the girl  Like release herself  Number two on the chest  What?  Oh is that what that is?  Is that what scat is?  Yeah I think so  Wow  The euphemisms are amazing huh?  Yeah  We're trying to keep it clean  For broadcast  Dude is that what scat is  When someone uses your chest as a bowl?  Yeah so you could even sculpt it too  Huh  Sharon 
[03:23:00]  I can't  Like I just  I default back to the  Why is it going to be fun for her?  Because that's the only way  To motivate anyone to do anything  Well maybe  Maybe it's fun for her  Because the guy gets so turned on  By his fetish  And she knows that she won't go to bed  With a blackened jaw  Well that's  That's probably  With a blackened jaw right  That's always an incentive  Yeah really  I know really  Connor  Is having a good time  I mean if she really thinks  That's going to be fun for you  Maybe she could be convinced  But  That's going to be a long shot  You probably should find somebody 
[03:23:30]  Who has the same interest  Right right right right  Alright we only have  Time for a few more questions here  Let's say hi to  Looks like  On Ray  On Ray?  Hello everyone  How are you today?  Hello On Ray  Thank you for calling the program  Thank you  Thank you Care Bear  Shannon are you there?  Yeah  Okay good  I have a question for you  I'm currently dating another man's girlfriend  I'm playing a bit of a devil myself  If you understand  But my question  Is that  When  This gentleman  His name is Mark  When I have his girlfriend over 
[03:24:00]  And  She is  Performing  How I say  Oral treats  Yeah  That's a good way  Oral treats  On me  She tends to have a bit of a gag reflex  Very quickly  And I want to know how to  Kind of  Maybe work her out of that  So I can  Perhaps push a little more down  If you  If you understand what I mean  You understand what I'm saying to you?  Yeah  How do you get the girls  To open their throats?  Yeah because  This one  She seems to not  Be able to take  As much as I want to give her  Cunt  What do you think? 
[03:24:30]  Yeah  Well maybe she's just not going to be able to  It sounds like she's already trying too hard  Or she shouldn't be gagging  But she should probably use her hand  At the same time  She does use her hand a little bit  But I try to  Push more  And not more than  Two or three inches  Go in  And then she tends to have  You know  At a tough time with that Cunt  I don't understand  How I can maybe  Get her to be able to accept more  Without  Kind of  You know  Having a gag reflex  Or  What do you think?  Yeah  Well it's  It's too much  It's too much 
[03:25:00]  Maybe it's just too much  But there's nothing I can do  To try to  Help her get past that  So she has to  She can use her hand  At the same time  But obviously  It's going too far  She wouldn't be gagging  Because gagging happens  Pretty far back  Yeah  There's too small mouth  Yeah  On Ray  Is that it On Ray?  On Ray  On Ray  He punched out  Or his phone may have  I guess his phone might have gone out  I sound like his cellular  Alright well  That was very good  Good question  Good answer  We got a couple of more 
[03:25:30]  Yeah let's go to  Scott in  California  Scott Modesto  Modesto  Scott  Yes hi  Little Connor  Hi  Hey there  I had a question for Shannon  I got in a little bit of legal trouble  Shannon  Because my wife really wouldn't  Shut the hell up  And Connor you were there  You remember that right?  I do  Yeah  It was a really  She was a pain in my ass  And see Shannon  I'm surrounded only by guys now  Because of my little legal trouble  And because Amber's gone  And my wife is well 
[03:26:00]  Not with us  So I was just wondering  Now that I'm surrounded by guys  How should I go about  Satisfying my desires?  Surrounded by guys?  You're in prison?  Yeah he's in prison  Oh okay  He calls our program a lot  Yeah  Okay  I'm trying to picture this  I know  He's been in for about a year now  And a lot of the things  That he enjoyed doing  Fishing  Things like that  He's not able to do anymore  So I guess he wants to  Enjoy himself  Is it normal to go gay  Because you're in prison  I guess is what he wants to know 
[03:26:30]  Well you know  The spectrum of  Kind of straight to gay  Is this continuum  And through history  Men tended to be  Kind of gay  Before they got married  Really?  Yeah  If you look at ancient Greece  And lots of parts of the world  Even now  It's considered  Like a normal boy's activity  That you have  So it's not gay  If you're single  Yeah  I think  The definition of gay  And straight  Is all what you decide  To call yourself 
[03:27:00]  Well it's not gay  If you don't push back  Whatever makes you feel  Like oh that's okay  I don't know  Whatever you call yourself  But I mean  There are labels  I think that make  Some kind of sense  Right?  Yeah there are  I mean people who are  Not interested in having sex  Of the opposite sex  Ever  That's on the far end  Of gay  But most people  Somewhere in the middle  Somewhere in the middle  So  Freddie Krueger  Rob Halford  You could go out with girls 
[03:27:30]  But then on the other hand  You're equally as comfortable  Maybe putting a java log  In the fireplace  And having a glass of wine  With another man  In your pajamas  Let's relax  Perhaps  And that's absolutely acceptable  Well you know  I think if we didn't have  Social taboos  Around being gay  More people would be  More fluid about it  I agree  Right right  I agree  But do you  Do you think that's a bit  Faggoty  The scenario that  Anthony just  Described  Two men  Just hanging out  Watching TV  With a fire going 
[03:28:00]  In their pajamas  Maybe  Glass of wine  Some cheese and crackers  Cheese and crackers  That sounds like a nice  Kind of almost  That's a date  It's a date right?  That's a real date  That's what we were thinking  It kind of sounds like a date  Yep  Yeah  And then all of a sudden  The firemen show up  Oh it's fantastic  It's fabulous  And that's a porn film  Fabulous  Yeah  Alright  Why don't we go on  To the next question  It's Bill in New Hampshire  Bill you have a question  For the sexpert  Oh Shannon  I sure do  Hey ONA  Nice 
[03:28:30]  Hey sugar nut  Hi  Alright  Bill what do you have  For Shannon  Um well  Something I've been  Feeling really weird  About for a long time  When I was young  Okay  I used to  Kind of experiment  With my friends  Um  We'd hide under a porch  And play silly games  Is that normal?  What do you mean  What do you mean  Silly games?  Um  Well  We'd get under the porch  And  You know 
[03:29:00]  We'd kind of  Gobble each other up  A little bit  I'd rest my head  On my friend's thigh  And  We'd just go from there  What?  Did you have any  Weird name  For this uh  Thing?  It sounds like  A circle jerk  With oral sex  Oh  Well  We called it  Monster Rain  Monster Rain  Monster Rain  What kind of a sick  Idiot would come up  With a name like that?  What is that?  Why Monster Rain?  What does the rain have to do with it?  Yeah  Helen what do you think of that?  Well it was a good excuse  To get under the porch  We would pretend  It was raining monsters 
[03:29:30]  So the rain was coming  You guys would hide under the porch  And then  Right  Give each other oral favors?  Exactly  Oh okay  So you know  Shannon  It's little kids  Blowing each other  Yeah  Where do you stand on that?  Helen is that normal?  It seems like a thing  Yeah  It seems perfectly normal  I think Monster Rain  Is pretty creative  But  Yeah  There you go  I can feel a lot better  About myself  Yeah  I mean  How old are you  When that  Like when you and  Jimmy Robinson  Don't do that anymore  Helen 
[03:30:00]  No no no  I'm asking the sex part  How old is that  When you're not normal anymore  For doing that?  Well I don't know  If you're ever not normal for it  I mean  Because then you just  Well the bible says different  Huh?  At some point  You just cross over into gay  Alright  Right  Right  Once you've hit puberty  God willing  You know  Then you're just  Seeing guys instead of girls  Under the porch  Yeah  No that  Yeah but  That seems like a normal  Kid thing  Yeah Bill  Don't worry about it  Thank you for the question  Yeah that's  Thanks Bill  I like that one actually 
[03:30:30]  Let's go to New Mexico  And talk to Mike  Mike what's going on?  Not a whole lot  How's it going on eh?  Good we're enjoying  Shannon  Shannon Muller?  Mullin  Mullin  Mullin I'm sorry  Hello marmalade bag  Oh yeah  Shannon I got a question for you  Great  Shannon  Yep  Oh  Something must have  Happened to his phone  Uh oh  Did we lose  New Mexico?  Yeah  Okay  I don't know what that was 
[03:31:00]  Sorry Shannon  Let's go to  He had asked like  Shannon  Like it was going to be  A good question  Yeah  We lost him  It could have been a good one  Now we're all going to be  Wondering what he was going to say  Which is  Always uncomfortable  Uh  Wool Jimmy is calling  From New York  Yes  Wool Jimmy  Hey Opie Anthony  Little Connor  How's it going?  I've been better  I'm kind of wet behind the ears  Oh  That's terrible  Well let's give you  A little background information  I'm a 35 year old aspiring comedian  And uh  I enjoy ladies of the night  Occasually  Really 
[03:31:30]  And the problem is  You know you're um  You're an aspiring comedian  Can we see you um  Anywhere  Uh actually you can see me  At the downtown  On December 23rd  That would be what  This Thursday night  That would be  Okay  Go to my website  Eatabullet.com  If you'd like to see my  Luscious body  Are you  Are you going to hopefully be funny?  Oh  I will kill  I'm ready to go  Or is it going to be  The same old crap  That uh  You're known for  Oh  Why do you got to do this  To me on radio?  Sean I'm just joking  We kind of know this guy  He's a local comedian 
[03:32:00]  Connor  And he's a meaty disaster  Connor you have something  To add to Jimmy?  Yeah a little  If you want to go see  A little Jimmy  You can see him  And actually uh  Nathaniel who's headlining  At 516-293-7700  That's the downtown  A little plug for you  A little Jimmy  Thanks a lot  I'm going to come to you  In actually  Alright  Shannon if you'd like  To come too  It's on me  Cool  Yeah that sounds like fun  Well my problem here  Is that uh  I enjoy my ladies  At night like usual  And um  I have a hard habit  Of laying on my back  And having them  Urinate on my throat  Mmhmm  Um 
[03:32:30]  I need to get over this  Because I'm running  Out of money  My mother's getting  Very distraught  Over this situation  You told your mother  About that?  My mother actually  Left a message  On my answer  Oh my god  You know what  Oh my god  Okay yeah  Uh Shannon  We do have that phone call  Oh no please don't  We do have that phone call  But uh  Shannon we'd love to play this  It's a message  That uh  Little Jimmy's uh  Mother  Left  Little Jimmy  On his phone  Mmhmm  And it's about  Uh  Ladies of the evening  And maybe what  Jimmy could do to uh  I don't know  Stop  Stop seeing them so much 
[03:33:00]  How interesting  Let's hear it  Yeah maybe you care  To have some insight  Yeah I mean  You're the sexpert  I mean you know  What does  What does  Little Jimmy Norton's  Mom know  About prostitutes  Right  Right  Let's give a  Alright  Hold on  Little Jimmy  Hi sweetheart  It's mom  How are you  Jimmy I know  This is a little awkward  But everyone's fine here  But we heard the radio show  We love it by the way  And you were talking about  Giving up  You know  The ladies of the evening  Um  Which is a wonderful thing  But you know what  Dr. Phil always says 
[03:33:30]  Replace something  With something  So I was thinking  You know  You have that nice  Gym downstairs  And you know  Just for like  20 minutes  For half an hour  And you would feel better  Use that  And also  There's gyms in New York  You could go  You could exercise  And you would feel  A whole lot better  You'd lose a little weight  You'd tone up  And you relieve  You know  Tension and stuff  And you'd be meeting  Other people  I don't know honey  I just thought  It might be a good thing  I'm sorry  I'm interfering 
[03:34:00]  I know  I just  I'm thinking of you  Nobody knows I'm calling  So uh  Don't get offended  Or think I'm strange  But I am a mother  And I worry about you  You're doing so well  Everything is falling  Into place  This might be just  One of the  You know  The health thing  It would help  It would help you  Sweetheart  Well anyway  That's it  I'm not going to go on  I know it's not my business  But anyway  I love you  And I feel I can  Interstate this  I'm your mother  I'm taking a special license  But anyway  We're looking forward  To seeing you at Christmas  I really hope you can make it 
[03:34:30]  And uh  Anyway  Don't be mad at me  Okay sweetie  I love you  Talk to you soon  Bye bye  And there it is  Little Jimmy's mom  Isn't that sweet  Little Jimmy  Thank you  Thank you for uh  You know  Sending that in  And sharing with everybody  We greatly appreciate that  But Shannon  What we were thinking  Is that what was  Little Jimmy's mom saying  Because of the fact  She was saying  Dr. Phil says to replace things  And that he should go to the gym  Is that basically  He's kind of fat breasted  And awful  And that picking a prostitute  Is probably the only option  Until he does a few crunches  Well she said that really nicely 
[03:35:00]  If that's what she thinks  Actually I'd like to play right now  The uh  A phone call that uh  Our own Connor's mother  Uh made to uh  Connor  Oh yeah  Hi uh Connor  It's mom  Next stop  Davy Jones locker  Um 
[03:35:30]  Uh  Hello  Is that it  Yeah I don't even know  What that means  Yeah  I didn't get that  I didn't get it at all  It's an old Sicilian message  They got diapers  I don't get that either  So  Um  Well  Any advice to  Wool Jimmy  As far as the hooker habit  And the mom  Calling and all that  He kind of sleeps with the guppies  Well exercise is always a good idea 
[03:36:00]  But  Yeah  It's not exactly equivalent  To a urination  Right  Exactly  So probably that won't change  What you feel like doing  But it's always good to get fit  Okay  Uh  Does that help you a little Jimmy  That really helps a lot actually  I don't  I don't feel so bad about myself  Alright  Very good  Thank you for calling the program  Alright  Thanks a lot guys  Bye  Bye a little Jimmy  See you at the downtown  Yep  See you later  We'll get to see him again  That's going to be great  It's going to be a great show  Hey Greg in Vegas  We got to wrap up with  Shannon 
[03:36:30]  Hey I got a question  About pussy farts  Do I cry  Do I laugh  Do I hang a car freshener over it  Or what do I do  What was the first part  Pussy fart  Shannon  Where do you stand on that  Pussy fart  Well they're there  You know  But should girls feel silly  Uncomfortable  Should they just say  Ah  Ah here it is  Moving around  And if the guy wasn't there  It wouldn't be  Wouldn't be making noise  You know  Right  Good point  It's really the guy's fault  For moving around  So no 
[03:37:00]  So your book now  When did it actually come out  It just came out  At the end of November  So it's been out  For two or three weeks  Two or three weeks  Two or three weeks  So we must have  One of the first copies  We have one of the first copies  Oh thank you  I think they sent you  Like early  Why did you only send one though  I don't know  The publisher did  I'm sure we can get you more  Please do  Oh yeah  I'm running out of pages  Connor's going through it  Like crazy  I'll get them to send you  A couple more

Wow  Maybe you should talk to them  A little bit more  Before you get them home 
[03:38:00]  Oh good good  Good suggestion  Yeah  Well hey  Should you feel ashamed  That you picked up a man  When you thought you were  Picking up a female prostitute?  No no  I wouldn't  And what's the best way  You say to like  Wash man breath  Off of your junk  Just in case  You know something happened  And then you're  You're getting this  Waft of man breath  Yeah and your friend Tyler  Is knocking on the bathroom door  Going how was it?  And you're you know  You're in there  Washing shame off your mule  Anaseptic soap

Hello? 
[03:41:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[03:41:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[03:42:00]  Hello?  I don't know. 
[03:42:30]  I don't know.  Hello?  Oh, Christ. 
[03:43:00]  So, we're about to end the program.  Yep.  Okay.  We're about to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What did you guys think of Shannon?  She was all right, huh?  Yeah.  There you go.  I thought she went on a little long, but it was all right.  It was a good segment.  I thought she was very nice, but she got a little rude at the end.  I think she was pissed off at us.  I don't know why she was unhappy.  No, no.  I think she was pissed off at us.  I think she thought that some of the callers were making fun of her or something. 
[03:43:30]  No.  She didn't have to have an attitude about it.  No.  I've got to understand some of our listeners are just stupid.  She didn't really sound like an expert on sex.  Yeah, a lot of people are putting books out lately that just, you know, just to probably  make a profit and rip people off.  Why'd she hang up on us?  I didn't.  I don't understand.  You know, I think we treated her nice, and she hung up on us like that.  No, I didn't hang up.  I was going to plug the book again, but if she's angry at us, there's no reason for her 
[03:44:00]  to be angry.  I don't know why she hung up on us.  We're not angry.  I think that she probably thought...  You sounded so nice at the beginning of the call, and then at the end...  I thought we were having fun, but all of a sudden, she hung up a couple times.  I was ready to call her a bitch or something.  I mean, I'm enjoying this book.  I didn't really want to go there, but I didn't know what to do.  All of a sudden, we were left out there with, you know, an uncomfortableness that I've never  been hung up like that.  No, three times the same.  She hung up three times, man.  It was like there's no reason for it.  No.  Sometimes I understand we have phone problems, but for the most part... 
[03:44:30]  We had phone problems.  I don't know why she would do that.  And there was a couple...  Can you hear me?  She seemed nice at first.  Wow, the instant feedback are calling her the C word for some reason.  Why?  No, no, no.  For what?  I don't think she was that bad.  A little bitchy, maybe, but I wouldn't use the C word.  I would probably sense how, like, that was really rude to be talking, and all of a sudden  she's gone.  I know, just hanging up like that.  Wait, she's there?  Hello?  I'm here.  Shannon?  Hello?  Yeah.  I'm here.  Can you hear me?  Program complete.
