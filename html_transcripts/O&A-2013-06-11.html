<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a William Shatner impersonation before launching into a discussion about a viral video of a person BASE jumping.  This segued into a critique of a Sean F. song, followed by a conversation about protests in Istanbul, prompted by Opie's recounting of negative experiences with rug sellers and forced jewelry store visits during a past cruise there.  He then shared a story about a trip to the Parthenon with a former girlfriend, where her expectation of a proposal clashed with their relationship’s reality. This led to a bizarre comparison between the Shroud of Turin and a strand of Muhammad’s beard Opie claimed to have seen in Istanbul, sparking a discussion about religious relics.  Opie also mentioned his upcoming appearance on TBS’s "Who Gets the Last Laugh?", along with guests Amy Schumer and Sam Roberts.  The hosts then discussed a court case where a man slapped his lawyer, resulting in a revoked plea deal and jail time.  The conversation then jumped to Tim Tebow’s signing with the New England Patriots, Opie’s mountain climbing experiences, and upcoming guests Robert Zimmerman (George Zimmerman’s brother), Ozzy Osbourne, and a review of a humorous incident involving Ozzy and a book gift.  They also touched on the difficulties of jury selection in the George Zimmerman trial and Spaz’s surprisingly accurate predictions. The segment concluded with a discussion of social media and a magic trick performed by Opie, ending with a mention of a Lego AT-AT discovered in Opie’s house.

The show continued with a discussion about a late invoice and a 10% late fee, shifting to a debate about the Xbox vs. Playstation console rivalry.  The hosts then discussed the Wii and Kinect.  Studio guest Kenny was expected to review a new Blackberry phone after a break.  Upcoming guests were mentioned, including Robert Zimmerman, Kirk Fox, Ozzy Osbourne, Geezer Butler, and Seth Rogan.  A vulgar segment called "America's Got Genitals" followed, featuring crude descriptions and commentary of various penises.  This was followed by a discussion of Gene Wilder's career and *Willy Wonka*, along with Richard Pryor's absence from *Blazing Saddles*.  A disgruntled intern, Tyler, called in to complain about not being invited to Anthony’s online-streamed party.  The hosts then discussed a 12-year-old girl singing the Star-Spangled Banner and a viral video of a woman angrily confronting Dunkin’ Donuts employees, using racial slurs.  The closing segments mentioned Robert Zimmerman’s impending interview, included a bit with Uncle Paul about a Jordache jeans commercial, and a segment about an American soldier in Iraq, concluding with more discussion of Robert Zimmerman’s lateness and a Gary Busey audio clip.

The next segment began with technical difficulties in connecting with a remote contributor, Roland, for updates on George Zimmerman's news appearance. The hosts speculated on the case, debating whether Zimmerman's actions were stalking or self-defense.  Robert Zimmerman and his lawyer then joined in studio. They discussed jury selection, media portrayal, and the public’s emotional response to the case, highlighting the challenges faced by his family due to intense media scrutiny and misrepresentation of his brother and their family's mixed racial heritage.  He also provided information on a defense fund for his brother.  Following Robert Zimmerman’s departure, Ozzy Osbourne joined the show to promote his new album, leading to a lighthearted discussion about his music career, social media, online dating, and the show *To Catch a Predator*.

The show featured interviews with Ozzy Osbourne and Geezer Butler of Black Sabbath, discussing their new album "13," the recording process, and their past drug use.  This was followed by another interview with Robert Zimmerman, who discussed the ongoing trial, jury selection, the six-person jury size, and the racial implications of the case, again highlighting the challenges of the legal process and the impact of media coverage. Comedian Kirk Fox called in, discussing his prank show "Who Gets the Last Laugh," his upcoming show "The Test," and sharing prank ideas, including one involving arson. He also discussed his past as a tennis player.

The final segment promoted Black Sabbath's "13" with a giveaway, along with giveaways of "Oz the Great and Powerful."  A significant portion was dedicated to Robert Zimmerman and his lawyer, with the lawyer's enthusiastic entrance ("Slavo!") being a highlight. This was followed by an interview with comedian Mike Cannon, who shared graphic details of his personal life, including his father's post-divorce behavior, their competition to sleep with women, Mike's masturbation experiences, and his parents' reactions to his sexual exploration.  The interview concluded with a plug for Cannon's stand-up show. The show ended with further giveaways and listener calls.

Yeah, they want to build a mall where there's like sacred grounds  Oh, of course  There was some dumb religious shit  Oh, is that what it is?  No, not religious shit  Just like, you know, a nice piece of property  Is that it?  Yeah, and they want to build a mall there  I have not kept tabs on anything that's happening in Turkey  Well, that's what's happening  Do you need to know more?

I mean, you know, you should watch this shit  Well  It affects us all  There's so much to watch, though, in the news these days  Turkey is not on my very back burner  I went to Istanbul  Istanbul  I went there just before 9-11  Did you go to a marketplace?  I did  Yeah?  Was it dirty?  Yes, it was 
[00:05:30]  And the kids are very, very desperate  And they, I mean, they have to be very, very desperate if they came up to me  Oh?  Because me, 12 years ago, you think I dress shitty now?  Oh  So they saw money?  Yeah  When I was walking down the street?  Are you kidding me?  Well, you don't look Turkish  No  So you're probably a tourist  Yeah  Yeah  They must have assumed you had some cash on you  Well, it was one of those vacations where you go to these cool places  But they're in cahoots with each other 
[00:06:00]  And so you go to Turkey  And then they bring you to all these places  Assuming you're just gonna buy rugs and stuff  Oh, boy  And they make believe it's part of, like, the whole experience  I remember sitting in Turkey  Istanbul  In this place  And they're showing me those beautiful rugs  Oh  You know, the big, uh  The rugs that the genies fucking fly around on  But you're like, hey, I'm fucking  I'm just, I'm just chilling  I want to look at the ruins  And then look at some culture shit  And they make believe this 
[00:06:30]  Oh, no, this is culture shit  But it's the big  They're trying to sell you  It's like an Amway meeting  Yeah, yeah  Also, they're trying to sell you rugs  And they're like, and we could even ship them back to America  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  There's a scam no matter where you go, huh?  And every time the cruise ship stopped  It was the Greek islands and Turkey  Every fucking stop had one of those little things  Where they were in cahoots with the locals  And just imagine  Yeah, yeah  You're a shop owner or whatever the fuck  Or you own this rug store  And every day you're guaranteed a cruise ship 
[00:07:00]  With all these fucking Americans coming through  So, you know, they get a little tasty  Oh, they're getting a kickback  You know how we talk about plug-all on this show?  Yeah, yeah  So they get the kickback  Yep  Here, I'm going to bring you Americans every fucking day  And we're going to go right to your shop  You fucking kicked some money up to me  Yeah  Yeah  I remember we went to a beautiful Greek island  I forget which one  And we had to stop in a jewelry store  Butt sexo?  Huh?  Oh, butt sexo  That's a Greek  Because they love the ass sex over there 
[00:07:30]  But also, we're in a jewelry store  I'm like, what does this have to do with my vacation?  This isn't a vacation  But they make believe it has something to do with the local  I don't know  Where's the Parthenon?  Exactly  You think they just have a little deal cut with the people?  They have a deal at every island and every stop, man  And finally we're on to it  Because it makes it sound like you can't miss this  Stefano Singer is there  Fucking, you gotta sit there and listen to his drivel  Yeah, I finally started avoiding the first stop  Knowing that it was some horse shit 
[00:08:00]  The other corner of Mount Olympus  Right  And then the Parthenon, oh my god  It's falling apart, huh?  It is  It needs  Places in ruins  It needs a nice sweep  What a heck  I gotta be so hacky so early  It's pretty amazing, though  The Parthenon's pretty amazing  Yeah  That's some real fucking, like, ancient shit  Yeah, but of course the X had to fucking ruin that  Oh boy  I'm thinking, wow, the fucking Parthenon  Is there one of the wonders of the world? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, that's fucking  It's right up there, right?  That's a biggie  And I'm like, fuck, the Parthenon  We're walking around and just taking it all in  This shit was here  You picture the people that walked through history  And saw the same thing you're looking at  Right  It's crazy  Then we're walking away from the Parthenon  And I'm thinking, fuck, the Parthenon  I'll never be back here again  That was an amazing experience  And we're walking back to the hotel in Athens  And all of a sudden I look behind me  Because she's not, like, walking, you know, next to me anymore 
[00:09:00]  Uh-huh  And she's, like, she's about 10, 15 feet behind me  Crying her eyes out  Why?  She thought I was going to ask her to fucking marry me  At the Parthenon  Oh, no  I'm like, what, are you crazy?  Oh, no  We're barely hanging on here  So that's what I remember  Instead of a wonderful fucking day at the Parthenon  She's bawling  I'm like, we're not getting along  This trip was booked in advance 
[00:09:30]  Are you happy you didn't make anything  Oh, my God  I'd be in Anthony's world  Yeah, yeah  Just bawling  I'm like, what?  We just saw the Parthenon  Now we're going to get a Greek salad  What the fuck?  And she's weeping  Bawling  And I kind of asked her  And, you know  And I'm like  I don't know 
[00:10:00]  These broads, man  You take them to a really exotic place  They expect way more than you  Yeah, they do  You know?  It's like fucking, you know  They have all that romantic shit in their head  Well, fuck  Well, fuck  I mean, no, my point  Like, you have to look at it overall  Before we went to the Parthenon  And we're just hanging out in Huntington, Long Island  True  We don't have the Parthenon feeling now, do we? 
[00:10:30]  It's close  You know  We're walking around miserable  Both realizing that maybe this relationship's not working out  But then we go to the Parthenon  And now it's like, what?  Fucking, you got hit with magic dust or something?  Yeah, yeah  What the fuck is that about?  You know  Instead of maybe going, you know what?  That was a fucking good vacation  Maybe we could build on that  Maybe  Parthenon  Millions  You know  Yeah, exactly  Maybe if we had the same feeling as we're walking around Huntington 
[00:11:00]  And then we go to the Parthenon  Then maybe it makes sense because it matches up  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I wasn't going to be caught up in that romantic shit  Knowing that overall there was issues  Yeah, that would have been awful  Come back after a romantic  Oh  And then we're back  Buyer's remorse  Yes!  Buyer's remorse  Because you get bamboozled  Right  And all of a sudden I'm fucking engaged  But now walking around Huntington going  Wait, well, where's the Parthenon?  I need the Parthenon  You don't have the Parthenon  But now you're stuck with  You know 
[00:11:30]  Oh boy  Oh boy  Hope she's doing well  Wherever the fuck  Nah, I don't give a fuck either way  It's  Gives a fuck  Yeah  You're just somebody I used to know  That's why that song rules  Isn't that weird?  Hmm?  It is  It's just somebody you used to know  That's it  Most important people in each other's lives for a while  And then  Right  All of a sudden it's just like  I don't know what you're doing  I don't give a shit  I don't even know when her birthday is  That's it  I guess that used to be important  In my life 
[00:12:00]  Used to be  Right  I don't know that when I'm dating a girl though  I don't know when anyone's birthday is  Oh, I used to know the birthday  I'm so terrible  But I really don't know the day  Yeah  Beep beep beep beep beep  Oh, yeah, there it is  Two days  Have the two day alarm set  Right  I love this damn bowl  I love turkey  Yeah  Fuck yeah  It was a cool fucking place, man  I love that damn bowl  It was fucking cool  Belly dancers  Yeah  Oh, yeah, it was nice  The blue mosque was amazing 
[00:12:30]  It needed the money  Do you do touristy shit?  You know what?  Not really  I'm, uh  You know, the Caribbean kind of guy  I don't want beaches and things like that  But as far as going to faraway lands  Especially over there  Over the Atlantic  No  I remember the cruise ship is pulling into Istanbul  Yeah  And all you see is  Mosques  Oh, boy  Yeah, but this was before 9-11 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah  So think about it  But now if you see that  You know, instantly  You're like  What the fuck?  Where am I?  Danger  They're going to take my head  They're going to lop heads off  They're going to take my head  But I remember just walking around  And there were just moss everywhere  And you had the Shiites  And a bunch of Shiites in that area  Which were very, very scary  And then I told you  I stayed online for  I think it was two hours  To see one strand of Mohammed's beard  What's the security like around that?  I don't remember  It's been so long 
[00:13:30]  I don't remember  I don't think  I don't remember over-the-top security  I remember this piece of hair  It was one strand of hair  Just spray nair on it  Let's just dissolve  Could you find it online?  Because, you know  I don't want to kill people's religion  But I thought it was a complete waste of time  But to those people  They were losing their minds  That they'd get to see this  Hello  Hello  It was behind this huge  Extremely thick glass  And then I think there was more  Another glass box inside that 
[00:14:00]  Wow, damn  Yeah, it was ridiculous  And the line was unbelievable  And I just remember thinking  We spent two hours to see this  It's one strand of hair  Yeah, there it is  That's it  There you go  And yeah, okay  So it's in a really  It's in a thick glass box  And then inside it is another glass  Enclosement  Damn  And supposedly that's a strand of his fucking beard hair 
[00:14:30]  Now what's the equivalent in like the Catholic religion?  Shroud of Turin  Would that be like  No, would that be like having Jesus' beard?  Yeah  A piece of Jesus' beard hair?  Yeah  Yeah  That's pretty righteous  No, if that's your religion, I get it  But if you're not part of that religion  I was like, really?  Yeah  If that's legit, that's a pretty impressive  But I don't even know the story behind that  You ever seen the Apostle Paul's toenail clipping? 
[00:15:00]  Fucking  Yeah  It'll change your life  Yes  I don't understand that  Yeah?  Like, what's the story?  How do they know that is?  A piece of his  I don't know  How the fuck do you know anything?  Maybe we can look it up  See what the story  I don't know  Probably got passed down  Someone who  Yeah  I don't even know how Muhammad died  I don't know what his death was  It was a skiing accident  Oh, is he skiing?  Yes  It was skiing  I didn't know that  Mm-hmm  Wow  Nobody wants their thing 
[00:15:30]  They've done tests on the Shroud of Torrent and stuff  It's just not what they think  No, but they don't want to  You don't think?  No, they've  Yeah  They don't want to go 100% and say it's definitely not  They're like, well  Right  Yeah  It's off by hundreds of years  Yeah  It's just not it  Yeah  What do you know what that is, Sam?  Just said that the beard was said to have been shaven from Muhammad's face after his death  By his favorite barber  Uh  In the presence of Abu  I can't pronounce his last name 
[00:16:00]  And several others  Not gonna be working here anymore  Individual hairs were later taken away  So why are they down in one?  It was a long time ago  People lose hairs  What year did he die  Is it 1,500?  How irresponsible are you?  You got a baggie full of his beard hair  And you lose it all except for one strand  Yeah  I guess they didn't have Ziplocs back then  Yeah, right  Uh, even Sam's mom  You know  Packs in  That's right  Sam's hair 
[00:16:30]  Right  Someday maybe, right?  Thousands of years from now  Maybe  And this is  From the Prophet Roberts  Yes  Yes, he preached mediocrity wherever he went  No, they probably just took it and left with it  Like you kept it  Right  Yeah  Yeah  What year did he die?  Hey, do they shave the beard after they die?  Is that traditional?  I don't know  Because those guys like to grow their beard  Do they ever?  But then what happens?  You die and then you gotta get rid of the beard for  For, uh  That doesn't seem to make sense  No  Well, unless 
[00:17:00]  Unless you gotta have it down here  But you can't have it up there  We know nothing about it  Except for the, um  You know, blowing up things part  You know  We know that part of the Muslim religion  Hmm  But, uh  All that other stuff  I don't know much about that  I know  I know the lopping off head part  And the virgin thing  The virgin thing  Everyone knows that  I know the, uh  The virgin thing  Wrap the women up  Stone them if they're raped  It's a hot joke  But the virgin thing is overrated  Virgins in general always suck  They're terrible  They always suck  I think, uh  Maybe you get, like, uh

[00:23:00]  Gonna be in there  T-fucking-bow  Belichick  Doesn't play though  So I don't know  What he saw in Tebow  Where he's like  No, we gotta have him  Cause Belichick  Isn't gonna fuck around  Like Rex Ryan  And then  Like, oh, we just want  Some asses in the seats  So let's get this  Fucking freak show  No, none of that shit  They do very well  Attendance-wise up there  So  Sure  I mean, supposedly  Rex Ryan never wanted Tebow  So they just fucking  Sat him that whole time  Belichick would not  Bring him to the Patriots  And sit him  There's no fucking way 
[00:23:30]  Belichick's not that guy  I heard Belichick  Had been just fucking  Trashing him though  The whole time  I heard Belichick  Was always a fan of his  Really?  Yeah, I really did  Who's saying this?  I really did  I've heard  People are saying  What?  People are saying, yes  People are saying  Yes  Exactly  Yes  You go to Hobbit Square  And they're just fucking  Talking about it  I'm telling you  Yeah  Yes  They sit around  Fucking at the T-stop there  And they're just all about  Talking Tebow  Are they excited? 
[00:24:00]  How does that?  And then they go into that  Really nice  Two-level Starbucks  They get a nice coffee  And then they  Go back out  And they talk more Tebow  Yeah  I'm telling you  It's happening  How is Boston feeling  About the T-bow  I think they probably  Are not happy about it  I would think  They're not happy either  But Belichick's  Not a stupid man  Yeah  So I mean  They're not bringing him  Up there  To just sit his ass  He sees something  That he could use  Within the offense  Utility player? 
[00:24:30]  Oh sure  Yeah  He's not gonna  He's not gonna be  Fucking  Taking a shitload of snaps  But he's gonna  He's gonna come in  A bunch  A little more than he was  On the Jets  Yeah  A little more work  Yeah  Give Brady a little more time  Fucking  I don't  Kissy face with models  Exactly  Is that what it is?  I don't think  I don't know  I mean Tebow's a bad quarterback  But I don't think he's as bad  As you know  The Jets made him look  Last year  It's somewhere in between  Would be fun 
[00:25:00]  He just chose not to use him  At all really  Would be fun to watch him  Play against the Jets  And just fucking  Kick their ass  I don't think it would happen  But it would be one of those  Like kind of fun things  To watch  We're heading toward  The same shit as last year  That fucking Sanchez  Is gonna start again  We're heading toward  The same shit  Are there just no  Quarterbacks available?  We picked up  We picked up  What's his name  But they're saying  Fucking Sanchez  What's his name?  Yeah I call him  What's his name  Why is Belichick  Taking Tebow  There's gotta be a reason  Cause he's pretty 
[00:25:30]  He must be something he likes  See I just know  Basic sports shit  But then someone  Will go deeper  And explain exactly why  Well exactly  Belichick  That's who's gonna go deep  You think he wants to  Embarrass the Jets  By using  I mean maybe he  Wouldn't think that  Could be  Like a fucking troll move  He's so obsessed with the Jets  The troll move  Maybe that's  Maybe he might think that way  Tebow's gonna be trained  As a tight end  Ooh  Sexy  Only wants  Only wants Tebow  For Jets playbook  I mean  Really  You're gonna fucking 
[00:26:00]  Get a quarterback  Just for one fucking  I don't think the Patriots  Are gonna  Are worried about the Jets  In the upcoming season  Justin  They're in the same division  Really?  I didn't know that  No they're not  That's the only thing  I can see  Cause Tebow's garbage  And I live down here  In Florida  And all I have  All I hear about  Is St. Tebow  And I just hate it  Yeah I'm not a fan  Of the whole St. Tebow thing  But I don't think  He's garbage garbage  I mean  Wow that's fucked up  God don't make no junk 
[00:26:30]  Oof  Would you climb Mount Everest?  No  I have  You have?  Yeah yeah  We were off  Remember  I was  I was up there  I was like whatever  Yeah  I looked around  How long did you stay up there?  Ah fuck man  Six seven hours  Just laughing  Six seven hours  I'm just laughing  I went shopping  At the little shop  They have up there  The Everest  It's just  Oh they're showing  They show  Oh wait  Let me see  Everybody in the courtroom  Was laughing  Look at that  I'm not accepting 
[00:27:00]  These plea negotiations  Judge threw out  The plea deal  And gave Johnson  30 days  30 days in lockup  On the spot  What happened  Was the judge  No his was incredible  The judge said to  Johnson  You should be very happy  With your attorney  He's done a great job  And Johnson just went  Yeah man  And a couple of people  Do you go to the court  And she freaked  I mean that is unacceptable  That is not the law  Is it what we saw  That is an unbalanced woman  Yes that's what he did  It was a blocker  It was also in response  To something she said 
[00:27:30]  That's horrible  I was just reading it  And I thought  Oh my gosh  How horrible  Because he slapped  His attorney  Thinking it was a woman  And it was a man  It was a man  Sports guy  It was that he  The judge felt  He was disrespecting the court  And that he was  Because everyone else  Then started giggling  In the courtroom  So she felt  That he was not  Taking this seriously  And that was life  And you can see his face  You didn't show a part of the clip  Where he turned around  And he was  I mean  God we do such a better job  Than these idiots on TV  Yeah but you'd think  If he knew  Holy fuck  Put us on TV  They're boring the fuck 
[00:28:00]  Out of everybody  What's up with Donnie Deutsch  Just getting out of bed  And just rolling in  To the TV studio  You'd never even know  He rolls out of bed  And his fucking clothes  Are on his bedroom floor  And he figures out  What doesn't smell too bad  And he puts it on  And he just gets  In that studio  I guess he's just  A casual guy  Casual guy  Just fucking  Puts his fingers  Through his hair  Tries to comb it  Real fast  With his fingers  And he's ready to go  That judge really  Was not fucking  Dealing out justice  Right there  No what a humorous bitch  She's a twat 
[00:28:30]  And what will happen  Is they'll find another judge  And they're gonna fucking  He's not going  For 30 days  First of all  He's not going  For 30 days  First of all  He shouldn't have gotten  A plea deal  In the first place  He should have gotten  At least 30 fucking days  For headbutting a woman  Like in a domestic  Well let's slow down  A little bit  Let's slow down  A little bit  Yeah  Stop jumping  Let's find out  What she did first  Believe me  Believe me  I've wanted to  Punch the shit out of  Maybe supper was cold  Maybe  Maybe supper  Supper was cold  But you can't then 
[00:29:00]  Give a plea deal  Like that  Dangle it in front  Of someone's face  Like that  And then take it away  Based on  Her kind of  Being annoyed at it  And kind of  Putting him in the position  Where you know  He's excited about the fact  That he got a good deal  And the lawyer's right there  And they're kind of  He's feeling good  Asked him how he feels  About the lawyer  And it is a very  You know  It's a sports thing  Right  Knocks him on the ass  A little bit  And it's not his fault  The rest of the courtroom  Started laughing  Right  She's like pinning it on him  That he's fucking doing 
[00:29:30]  You know  He's doing seven minutes  In front of the crowd  That's why  It's a dramatic thing today  But he's not gonna do  The 30 days  Remember that little girl  Where was she  In Florida  She talked up to the judge  And they did the same shit  I forgot what that  Whole case was about  Yeah  You know  Fast forward a couple days  It wasn't in the headlines anymore  And they didn't give her  That sentence  Yeah  She looks like  Fuck the asshole  I guess she thought  She was gonna have this moment  Where everybody looks  At this video  And they're like  Wow man  She doesn't take any guff 
[00:30:00]  Oh that's good  You know  Fuck him  But everyone's looking at it  Like she's a fucking  Unstable bitch  Yes  I agree  Because that one girl  That one girl  Who cursed at the judge  And gave him the thing  It's like that's  A little different  Than him doing something  Dumb with his lawyer  Yeah  That girl you're watching  Going just shut up  Yeah yeah yeah  Don't tell the judge  Fuck you  What are you doing  You can't say  Fuck you to a judge  That's contempt  Yeah  Right  I mean and to pull up  A deal  For something that has  Absolutely nothing to do  With the original crime 
[00:30:30]  Absolutely  And the deal  You know  If you want to give him  Contempt  That's you know  That could be argued  But to take away  The plea deal  Based on that  Is ridiculous  Ridiculous  Like I said though  It'll be overruled  Or whatever  He's not gonna do  On appeal  Yeah yeah  He's not gonna do  30 days  Yeah that's correct  Then again if he appeals  Or could he lose  His plea deal  And have to go for  Six months if he loses  That like who knows  I don't know  We'll see  I don't know  We got some more  Legality happening here 
[00:31:00]  On the show today  Huh huh  Oh yes  We got Robert  Coming in  We got George Zimmerman's  Brother coming in  Robert Zimmerman  So that's at 8 o'clock  Robert Zimmerman's  Coming in at 8  He's been  He's been down there  In Florida  Watching the  Pre-trial  And the jury  Selection was  Going on yesterday  I was watching  Some of that  Holy shit  I don't know  How they do it  The defense has  Such a hard  Fucking job  Picking jurors  Because they want  To question these people 
[00:31:30]  So they're asking  Them tough questions  Because they want  To get the right  Jury in there for them  But they can't  Piss off the jurors  Through their questioning  Because you don't  Want them holding  A grudge  When they're sitting there  So they gotta be  Very nice  You know usually  You see lawyers  And they're  On the attack  When they're  Questioning a witness  On the stand  So they're  Questioning these  Potential jurors  And they have  To be very nice  If the juror  Doesn't understand  Something  And starts getting  A little rambunctious  The lawyer  Has to then 
[00:32:00]  You know  Alright  No no I understand  It's very walkie  On eggshells  Kind of a thing  Why don't they  Have robots decide  You think they  Should do a robot thing  Yeah  Because everyone  Knows about this case  It's going to be  Tough to find a jury  Imagine robot jurors  Oh he's gotten  Everything else right  People don't really  Know Spaz anymore  I know  Unfortunately  It's just  Spaz has been around  In what  12 years at this point  11 years  N-E-W  Something like that  N-E-W  But you would come up  With some fucking 
[00:32:30]  Crazy far-fetched  Shit  Hair-brained  Crazy  And ten years later  This shit is like  All coming to fruition  Being talked about  And fucking text  You text me every once  A while  With the latest one  One of the fucking  You just texted me  Two days ago  About the giant mosquito  One of the best lines  Was when he was like  And look out  You'll get encephalitis  From the giant mosquito  And we used to say  Giant mosquito all the time  Right  And then I look on  Fucking  Look at the news one day  And they're talking about  Jersey  And Florida 
[00:33:00]  I mean  Having these giant mosquitoes  Which are very fucking  Scary and dangerous  Spaz had the giant mosquito  There you go  Giant mosquitoes  Invade Florida  Brilliant  Giant mosquitoes  Look  11 years ago  Spaz warned us  Of the giant mosquito  And now  They're here  Remember when he talked  About pointing microwaves  At hurricanes  Yes  And actually  Pointing them at  Tornadoes  And then hurricanes  It was using  Kitty litter  Right  To put in the clouds  To suck up all the moisture 
[00:33:30]  Right  All of these things  Have been  Robot surgeons  Right  Robot surgeons  He did robot surgeons too  Yes he did  Robot surgeons  Now we sit here  In the year 2013  And you think  Oh fuck  That's an easy one  No he did  This is 11 years ago  And we call him crazy  Yep  What do you  He used to do  A quick little segment  Once a week  Oh yeah  We can review  Or something  Microwaves  At tornadoes  For real  Oh yeah  And what does that do  It dissipates 
[00:34:00]  The energy  For somewhere  It disrupts  The energy  In the cloud  Wow  Yeah yeah  Yeah  But he  And his  Were always  A little off  From what they're  Doing now  Because he  Literally said  They should stack  Up microwave ovens  Pointed at the tornado  And then open the doors  And plug them in  All right look  He can't be perfect  With these  But  The first smartphone  Looked fucking ridiculous  Too okay  Exactly  You know  He's got the idea  Then you hone it  Yeah  What were you saying  George Zimmerman  Robots 
[00:34:30]  Yeah yeah  Oh  Robert Zimmerman  His brother  Who's coming in  At 8 o'clock today  Yeah  Which means  I'm going to get  Some fine candy crush  Time in today  And then Ozzy  Is at 9.30  So fuck it  I skate from 9.30  To 10  I'm here part time  Today  I love it  Ozzy and Geezer  And Geezer  Good job by the way  On the prep sheet  Oh no  Oh no  Well Sal does a terrific job  With the prep sheet  Yeah he did a really good job  Yep  First line  I'm not going to read  The whole prep sheet  Oh Sal  Oh good job

[00:36:00]  It was quoted  As  A signable contract  They think something  Along that  It was very British  Of him to say  Something like that  Yeah  Ozzy said that Bill  Was having certain troubles  No no no  Just playing  He said that  In some interview  That he was having  Trouble playing  Yeah  Oh wow  Well Ozzy's coming  In here today  That's great  Yes  We'll see you  Got any gifts for him  No just me  No we got your  Books in the corner  We got the Beatles books

[00:48:30]  With the buttons  See people have forgotten  But I used to be a huge Blackberry guy  And I hung in there  Way longer than I should have  Yes  And Kenny's still doing it  He's got the buttons  And the touch screen one  He's trying to adjust  The thing is heavy man  Of course it is  Yeah  It's heavy  And then I got a call  From Travis this morning  Right  He's like  Kenny said  Your phone went right  To voicemail  Cause I usually get a call  From Kenny  And I didn't get it  And I woke up  And I looked at the clock 
[00:49:00]  And my last alarm  Was ready to go off  But it was a little later  Than usual  I usually get the Kenny call  And I'm like  Oh okay  I'll be in  And when I get in  Kenny's like  I think my new phone  I don't know  I might have had  The wrong number  Is this it?  I didn't even know  What the number was  I think it was  My original landline  That I haven't had  In my house  For fucking ever  Right  But he doesn't know  How to  And he's still got  The buttons now  And then he's bothered  That the Anthony G's  Show up on his phone  Before the Anthony C's 
[00:49:30]  Oh boy  Oh boy  Yeah that's gonna drive him nuts  Yeah that will  Why do they?  I don't know  And why do they?  Blackberry stinks  Blackberry  He texted me about it yesterday  About his new phone  He said  I got my new Blackberry  You're gonna be so  J-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E-J-E 
[00:50:00]  mistake oh my god could you please with that robot oh siri would love him so he is so flustered  because he really doesn't like change no he does not that's his personality man yeah he likes to  get in that track and it has to be the exact same track every fucking day i that shit drives me nuts 
[00:50:30]  and that's weird for a security guy you would think he wants to mix it up every day so nobody's  you know right gets wise to your patterns i remember the day i go how about we go this way  and you could see it he's like oh like it was a whole new world now you're talking crazy  it was a whole new world  he is one fucking strange that's why he's great at what he does though man kenny is great at what he 
[00:51:00]  does i never question him ever yeah he's a very efficient but kenny's a guy who doesn't mind  reading small print he wants details handled he's a very deep he's he if he you give him a task  forget it i just know it's done every fucking time very competent very dutiful guy like he really he's  there's nothing lazy about him like you know i wish he would spend less time on his paperwork and  then maybe go outside but besides that he's great he stinks of treating himself he gives us a detailed 
[00:51:30]  fucking email about our expenses i've never read it i've never read him and i just know i could  trust kenny so i'm like i don't care how much my oatmeal cost and how much it added up to for the  month and i know he spends hours on the weekends i know itemizing everything itemizing sending i've  never read one of them i even said i don't need to know i don't like the little threat in there  though yeah if it's not paid in a timely fashion there's this percentage that gets tacked on 
[00:52:00]  i don't know that one i don't think he's ever hit us up for that no no i don't know but he has to  write it because we don't only get the emails our agent gets the emails and then the agent sends us  a check for the amount we just got to sign it and put it in the envelope and give it to him but but he  still treats it like we're getting the email and we have to figure out when it's going out and it  and if we don't do it in time how is it worded do you have one of them on your phone i got eight of  my just guys do you how is that threat i like any threat i swear though i've never read one of 
[00:52:30]  these this is gonna be the first one i feel like my legs are gonna be broken look it's it's not even  it's still in the unread fucking font of course it is why read it i don't read this shit  your invoice is attached uh he uses my my real name oh yes your invoice is attached please acknowledge  receipt of this email slash invoice have you ever acknowledged receipt no not even if he asked me 
[00:53:00]  in person i just looked at once but he's not doing this for us he needs to do this so he can check it  off his list of things to do yeah yeah and please remit payment at your earliest convenience payable  by check to blah blah blah tax id blah blah blah oh god invoices 30 days past due will incur an  additional 10% late charge thank you for your business it is greatly appreciated i don't like  that fucking 10% shit he's trying to push off on us after 30 days i have no idea if he's ever hit me 
[00:53:30]  up for that 10% because if if it was even approaching 30 days he would let you know like it's never gonna  get past 30 days i've been more than 30 days past but then i'll just pay like five at once have you  really you know shove him in the hand to him in the morning i don't even put him in the mail  we love kenny well we'll get an update on the new blackberry phone uh let's get his review oh we  should get a review a lot of electronics news uh with the xbox and playstation talk about that oh boy 
[00:54:00]  what a fucking that's one of these internet battles this is like apple fucking microsoft kind of uh  right you know electronic geek battle that goes on and well no one you're an xbox guy right i am an  xbox guy i recently upgraded to the the brand new playstation or the latest playstation i love it yeah  yes i love it well you know what and now it's xbox versus uh playstation it's a battle royale going 
[00:54:30]  on between these two companies what happened if you say you like one the other fanboys will  fucking just pound on you but what happened well i dropped their price um xbox came out announced  what uh their xbox one is going to be all about right and a lot of people um uh not happy with some  of the features a lot of people were confused about some of the features and they had this big  announcement and then right afterwards playstation sony comes out and announces their playstation 
[00:55:00]  for a hundred bucks less and you could share games and you could do a lot of things that  uh aren't happening with the xbox so uh the playstation people are like see face fuck you  right so i don't know well the numbers tell all so whoever um we'll see whatever company sells the  most is usually declared the winner but aren't they uh both companies are pretty healthy  yeah but it's not like a betamax vhs uh situation right where this could only be one winner no and 
[00:55:30]  it's not like the how is the we doing the we is for fucking people that we in their pants little  children's every once in a while we throw the we on down there in philly and we have a good old  time it's we really do i hate those cartoon cartoonies fucking faces here i mean i don't go  out of my way to i don't go out of my way to find wii games or any of that shit but do you use the 
[00:56:00]  wi-mote all right we absolutely the wi-mote the uh the three-point uh shooting fucking uh game is  great yeah yeah but we all look like idiots jumping up and down in the fucking living room  making believe we're nba stars yep yep yep and the golf is kind of cool but i but i don't i don't  i don't turn it on that much yeah it's a goof the wi's a goof it always has been a goof  but that technology seems like it would really fucking be great but it doesn't seem like they're 
[00:56:30]  advancing it too quickly because the connect works really well i've i've had the xbox with connect for  a few years now and uh it's amazing how it really does pretty realistically capture uh what the  fuck you're doing but better than the way yeah yeah and it's you don't have to have the  wi-mote you don't like the wi-mote i hate the wi-mote the only thing i like about the wi-mote is when  someone videos their friend winging it through the television by accident surrounds the wee castle

[01:06:30]  hey  what was he great in  well he was great in this obviously  blazing saddles  young frankenstein  stir crazy  fucking uh  silver uh  bullet  uh  silver streak  i'm sorry silver streak  so far you're naming a lot of uh  movies that are overrated  okay keep going  he's such a great  i loved him in blazing saddles  i loved him in uh  willy wonka  and  you know  the uh  i don't know what it was about him  i never was a huge huge fan of his  i don't think he can ever pull anything off 
[01:07:00]  himself very well either  it's usually an ensemble  typecast  or he needs a very strong co-star with him  i don't know  i just always found him a little too weird for my liking  his yelling  no one yelled funnier than jean wilder  like  it's true  his yelling and screaming  all right  where it starts slow and he just starts yelling  yeah  just  starts  yelling  yeah  yeah  yeah  that is kind of funny 
[01:07:30]  yeah  you're with me on this one huh  yeah yeah yeah yeah  yeah it was just something about him i don't know what it was  i mean obviously  he  was in some great movies  i turned around and there was a  what  you stupid ignorant son of a bitch dumb bastard  jesus christ i met some dumb bastards in my time but you outdo them all  get over there  all right  yeah  that's kind of funny  i do like that  like little  bastard shot me in the ass  he just looked completely crazy 
[01:08:00]  he did look crazy  yeah  yeah  he's a man he's the man  and uh willy wonka  i'm not saying he sucks i don't know  what a masterpiece that movie is  which one  willy wonka  and the story about him  what's the opening scene where i tell you the story where he has the cane  yeah  and then he uh  realized he doesn't need the cane  and he said he would do the role if they let him open the  his first scene be like that  and he said this way the audience will never know whether to believe me or not  like that was his idea 
[01:08:30]  yeah it's a little bullshit right from the start  yeah  that was pretty good  that was a good movie  i do the same thing but then i used the cane through the whole fucking movie and as  the credits are rolling i'm like ta-da  i don't need it  but that doesn't  who cares  who would care  i hated the the remake or the recreation or the reboot or the re whatever the fuck they call it  yeah you didn't like that one  because they used one little fucking um kickable  yeah they kind of cloned the uh  they cloned one kickable  oompa 
[01:09:00]  that took me out of the movie it was the same fucking guy  i hated the oompa loompa scenes in the original  oh god  because it was creepy right  no  oh you just didn't like it  aww  the sting and the fucking split camera and they just all  ugh  they're cute  i hate fucking midgets  aww let me see them  oompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doompa doom 
[01:09:30]  I would be shocked that these little fuckers were touching.  But you were also like 35 years old when this came out.  That's true. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I enjoy this, too.  Yeah, I like that.  I don't like their pants balls on the side.  Pushing 30 on you?  I only got a couple left in me.  That's it.  Yeah, that's true.  Use them while you can.  How he would just go from like crazy loving.  And Charlie, like he was just such an unpredictable maniac.  He was great in that role, absolutely.  He was great in that role, absolutely.  I can't believe, I just saw the Richard Pryor documentary, thanks to Jim Norton.  I didn't even know it was on Showtime. 
[01:10:30]  And it's just amazing that he was in Blazing Saddles.  Well, that was, and that documentary, by the way, there was a lot of footage not shown of his family.  There's a big controversy about that because his ex-wife did it.  But yeah, that was...  It's amazing.  The Hollywood just didn't believe in Richard Pryor for that role.  He got a writing credit, right?  Yeah.  He wrote.  He wrote a lot of it.  He wrote a lot of it.  And they, you know, Mel Brooks wanted him to be the guy.  He was mad at Mel Brooks for that, too.  We got Cleavon Little. 
[01:11:00]  Why?  Because Mel Brooks didn't stick up for him?  I'm sure Mel Brooks, you know, stuck up for him.  He felt, I think, that Mel did...  And that's, again, I'm just kind of going by...  But Hollywood, all those executives thought he was too unstable or something?  Yeah, they might have been right in that moment.  What's his name?  He did fine, but...  And then he went on to work with, um...  Fucking, uh...  What's his name?  Who?  Gene Wilder.  Fucking Gene Wilder.  Oh, yeah, they had some really funny movies together.  Of course.  Welcome sheriff scene over there.  But how do you not have Richard Pryor in that movie? 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, when you're doing an edgy comedy like that.  I think Cleavon is the one who told him.  I think Cleavon actually told Pryor.  They were, like, friends, and he hopped in the car and said,  Hey, get this movie, or whatever.  I think that's how Pryor found out was Cleavon Little telling him.  Really?  He thought he was getting it.  Cleavon was pretty smooth, though.  I don't know if Richard Pryor had that...  Well, he would have made it a different role.  That smooth, kind of...  Yeah, but you don't know.  Because, you know, unfortunately it didn't happen.  But I bet you Richard Pryor would have made it his own.  Yeah, Pryor was a good actor, man.  In Grease Lightning, he was good.  And fucking Lady Sings of the Blue. 
[01:12:00]  He would have been very good, though.  Grease Lightning!  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hi, buddy.  Are you bummed you weren't invited to Anthony's party?  Oh.  Oh, hey, your hair looks...  Let me tell you, your hair looks very nice today.  Does it?  It's not greasy.  You did.  It's got more fluff to it.  And why wouldn't you invite him as just a goof?  I feel bad for him.  We all know what you were doing on Friday.  We're not stupid.  The oil slick in the pool.  Oh, boy.  Why wouldn't you just fucking invite him as the goof? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Knowing that you didn't really give a fuck if he was there or not.  I don't know.  He's a nice guy.  I mean, you threw a whole party together because we have two hot interns.  We all know that.  We're not stupid.  Another dude.  Really?  I understand Anthony's thinking on that.  He doesn't need another guy.  There's plenty of dudes at the house at that point.  But he was so bummed out that he was texting the girls who were there while the party was  happening.  He was at home on Saturday watching the party on the West Stream.  If he was there, he wouldn't be texting them. 
[01:13:00]  He'd have been monopolizing their fucking time.  He watched the party on Ustream, man.  You're just not a nice person.  Where do you live?  You just invite him and just throw him in a corner somewhere.  He watched it on Ustream.  What the fuck, man?  On Ustream, that's terrible.  He's really bummed.  He's a nice boy.  He's working.  There'll be more parties.  But do you understand why you weren't invited?  To an extent, yes.  Oh, to an extent.  You don't have a vagina.  I'm an intern.  And you might be...  How old are you?  I'm 21.  Yeah, you're too old.  You've got to realize something, sir. 
[01:13:30]  You're too old by at least three years.  Look back at the history of Anthony and the interns.  You can do a little research and realize I don't even know their names.  Okay.  Yeah, very...  I'm not very intern interactive, let's say.  But, you know, we changed it up this semester.  Not really.  Got a couple of girls in the mix.  And, you know, you still are in that old school. 
[01:14:00]  All right.  Old school intern relationship.  Their new school intern relationship.  I'm a little more involved and interested in their, you know, future endeavors.  And their schooling.  Right.  And how the internship works out.  What's that?  For the lovely Sydney and Jackie.  You know their names like that.  Huh?  That was a stretch.  Just like that.  Yeah, that's from me.  Okay.  You are...  I'm going to be completely honest with you.  I don't know your name. 
[01:14:30]  That's fine.  That's fine.  I don't either.  I never...  What is it?  I'm Tyler.  I never knew that.  Tyler!  Nice to meet everybody.  Hi, Tyler.  I didn't know either.  No.  And I'm usually, at least, try to...  Ah.  I watched it on Ustream.  Oh, that makes me so fucking bummed.  You're not.  That's brutal.  That's terrible.  Just the tail end of it.  I wasn't there all night.  Oh, of course not.  Not that you guys know.  I'm having a summer party at my compound this weekend.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  And he was texting, like, intern Jackie saying, hey, I see you're taking some phone calls on Ustream. 
[01:15:00]  And she just rolled her eyes and put her phone away.  She blew me off.  Yeah, they actually were doing a little show live from the compound.  I saw some karaoke.  That was all right.  Karaoke.  It's always a lot of fun and stuff.  Do you sing a little karaoke?  Not anymore.  I gave that up.  Oh.  You never know.  All right, Tyler.  Thanks for the oatmeal.  All right, we've got to move on with the show.  And the girls got an hour yesterday. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, they did.  They got an hour.  Thanks, Tyler.  Oh, there he goes.  Thanks for the oatmeal.  You should have to invite Tyler next time.  There he goes.  And then the girls said they got, like, 200 followers on Twitter because of the Ustream thing.  Is this a girl who belts out the anthem for the Miami Heat?  She was good?  I know her.  Do we have that audio?  Oh, didn't sound good.  It's right now, live at our New York studio.  Supergirls.  Hi.  Oh, good morning to you.  Good morning. 
[01:16:00]  You know what?  If you were watching, if a person was watching that with their eyes closed, so just listening  to it, you would have thought it was a 25, 30-year-old woman singing it.  Oh, thank you so much.  And in particular, we just played a part where you hit the word free.  Free is your favorite part of that song because what happened?  Well, it's the feeling that I get.  He's a doofus.  Actually, a lot of people belt that part of the song, and I go into my head voice for  that, and I made that up when I was five, and I still do it today, and it's just the  crowd responds so positively to that part of the song. 
[01:16:30]  No, she's not.  And it's just so rewarding for me, and I can't believe they appreciate what I'm doing.  Because that's where you shift into the high voice.  Right, yes.  So what is it?  You said the high voice or head voice?  Head voice.  It's when you go into a higher voice.  A 12-year-old should not know what a head voice is.  Yeah.  You just go into your head voice.  Right, Brian, this is a different thing.  You don't do that in karaoke.  This is different than the head voice we have.  I've seen some, like, you know, kids that are very good at singing the anthem.  She's the type of kid that takes me out of movies because they were brought up to be 
[01:17:00]  like child stars, so there's nothing natural about them anymore.  Instead of watching cartoons, I actually used to love to watch musicals, like My Fair Lady  and The Sound of Music.  Did you really?  After I watched the movies, I used to dress up and sing songs all over.  She talks like she's way older than she really is.  She's a delight.  A delight.  Uncle Paul thinks she's a delight.  Sam's got it.  What an awful thing to say.  We only heard the last second of the fucking thing.  Yeah, maybe. 
[01:17:30]  Let's give her a fair shot here.  Sure.  12-year-old Star Spangled Banner singer.  Stunned.  Stunned?  Stunned by the dawn's early light.  What so proud they we held at the twilight's last evening.  It's okay.  Yeah, it's all right.  Whose broad stripes and bright stars.  It's a little effective, not quite mustered, but. 
[01:18:00]  We like you.  Huh?  We follow you on Twitter and everything.  What happened?  You don't like that version?  Julia Gale.  12 years young, but a voice full of soul and, let's be honest, agelessness.  Oh, look at that smile.  Oh, okay.  There's just an agelessness for this kid.  Yeah, but you don't like that version?  It's all right.  A mustard version of it?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm a creep.  Jesus.  What the hell am I doing here? 
[01:18:30]  I don't belong here.  The world loves that version.  You know that dumb version?  Don't care if it hurts.  I want to control.  He likes you.  What a perfect boudoir.  What a perfect soul.  Shut up.  I thought you said you liked them.  Do you like them or not?  I like the guy, sure.  You like a scene?  No.  You know that video does 50,000 views a week still?  Right.  A week. 
[01:19:00]  50,000 views a week.  Great.  Good.  But I'm a creep.  Oh.  I'm a widow.  What the hell am I doing here?  Doing here.  Come on.  When I don't belong here.  It's so careless.  It's so careless. 
[01:19:30]  Don't want to have control.  Control.  Ah, stop it.  I want to pass.  All right.  Let's turn it off.  I don't know why I get so annoyed by that.  What a perfect soul.  Oh.  Right.  You liked Young Frankenstein?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  You liked it?  Oh, my God.  Frankenstein.  Frankenstein. 
[01:20:00]  And Marty Feldman was really good in that.  Yeah.  That was kind of funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was married to Gilda Radner.  Someone was telling me.  Really?  I did not know that.  Oh, yeah.  Huh.  Oh, you didn't know.  I know.  Oh.  It's like.  Sorry.  Hey, did you know?  Yeah, really?  We got to play this lady at Dunkin' Donuts.  Oh, this fucking bitch.  Did you watch it?  Yes.  Should we just watch it?  No, it's like nine minutes long.  She is a piece of shit.  I know, but that's nine minutes radio we don't have to do. 
[01:20:30]  I don't get what she was going for.  I don't get what she was going for here.  What the fuck was she even going for?  She's out of her mind.  Yeah.  You know, I learned, I think it was on Sunday morning.  I'm not really sure which show, but there's a whole website dedicated to people, waiters  and waitresses being dicks on the receipts.  I didn't know this.  I think I've seen it.  When they write shit on there?  Yeah, there's a whole fucking website dedicated to, you know, fucking people being assholes 
[01:21:00]  in restaurants.  Yeah.  They're like putting that N-word on there.  And the shit they write on receipts and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know it was a phenomenon.  Phenomenon.  Phenomenon.  You know I can name 25 Muppets?  What?  Something I couldn't do before having kids.  Oh.  I know 25 fucking Muppets.  Wow.  How many do you know?  None.  You know the basics? 
[01:21:30]  Well, I know.  You know the Kermit?  I know Kermit.  Yeah.  You know Miss Piggy?  Fuzzy Bear.  Yeah.  All right.  You know the Fogs.  Miss Piggy.  I know Animal.  Chipperoni.  Chipperoni's in there.  I know the other one starts with a G.  Gonzo.  Gonzo.  You know Sweetums?  No.  Ralph?  Nope.  Ralph the Dog.  You know Janice?  No.  Dark Teeth?  Nope.  Dr. Honeydew?  Nope.  Oh, yeah.  I know Dr. Honeydew.  Sam the Eagle?  And then...  Was it the rat? 
[01:22:00]  No.  No.  Pepe?  Beaker.  Oh, you know Beaker?  Yeah.  You know Scooter?  No.  Um, Polly Shitfula Cunt?  Polly who gives a fuck?  My favorite.  My favorite.  Going to the Muppet phase.  Ah, that shows a little more maturity.  Muppets?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, it's not just that splash of, you know, color-y, cartoony on the TV that 
[01:22:30]  they're just mesmerized by.  Mmm.  Yeah.  So, we got a lady.  She didn't get a receipt at Dunkin' Donuts last night.  And I guess they have some kind of wacky policy over there?  Yeah, it's one of those places where they have a posted sign that says, if your server  or whatever, cashier, doesn't give you a receipt, your meal's on us.  Why do you give a shit if you have a receipt or not at Dunkin' Donuts?  What am I, deducting it from my taxes?  KFC does the same thing.  Cares.  Really?  Yep.  But who cares?  Yeah.  It says it's a guarantee. 
[01:23:00]  You know, I went into a place once.  It says that their breakfast was 100% guaranteed.  And the guy told me he was going to kick 100% of my ass.  What?  I had him fired.  Good.  He physically threatened you.  He physically threatened me.  Yes.  Used foul language.  He just fell in for some guy who was pissing.  I know, I know.  But you know what?  Dennis didn't want to fucking hear it.  Fucking threw his ass right out of there.  What a great movie.  The only bad part was, Dennis had to go in there and clean Big Hairy Pussy off the mirror 
[01:23:30]  himself.  Uh, well.  Ah, Dennis.  All's well it ends well.  Um, so you got this lady.  She didn't get a receipt at Dunkin' Donuts.  So she decides to go in the next morning and video herself being an insufferable cunt.  That's what it says here today.  She was.  If that definition of an insufferable cunt could be audio, this is it.  Okay, this is all being under video surveillance, by the way.  Um, I was here last night.  Right there.  What does that even mean? 
[01:24:00]  What does that even mean?  It's under video surveillance.  Like, she's recording it on her dumb phone.  Right.  And she's like, this is under video surveillance.  No, it isn't.  You're recording it on your dumb phone.  And some asshole has to deal with this that only makes minimum wage.  Right, right.  He's working at a Dunkin' Donuts.  Right.  I think it's bad enough if the day goes perfectly and you work at Dunkin' Donuts.  You leave feeling like shit.  If the day went swimmingly.  Now you got this fucking piece of shit.  So you think she's taking on the man when it's really just a guy making minimum wage. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, this poor sap.  Jesus.  Give me a receipt, okay?  And then she can turn into a complete rude bitch.  I don't know if you have any type of security cameras here, but you need to pull them up and listen to how she treated me.  Yeah, yeah, because that's the security cameras of four.  Facebook, I already posted on Facebook what you guys did.  I have never had a problem with day shift.  You have always given me exactly what I've asked for and respected me with kindness.  Well, then relax when it didn't happen once.  Yeah, one time.  You piece of shit. 
[01:25:00]  Exactly.  I've always had great service.  Great service at Dunkin' Donuts.  What are you talking about?  What happened?  She was supposed to get a receipt and the girl gave her crap?  She's supposed to get a receipt.  She says, well, you didn't give me a receipt, so the meal's free.  And then the server said, you can come back tomorrow for a free meal.  And the woman said that the server was rude about it.  And you know why they give receipts, right?  Why?  Because the employees are stealing.  But it sounds very much like Crazy Amy from Kitchen Nightmares saying, she said, are you sure? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know.  There's no reason for this fucking...  And then she's the one using, you know, bad language.  She wasn't being very professional in her protest here.  But the receipt thing really is to, you know, keep the stealing...  Is that what it is?  ...way the fuck down.  Yeah, man.  You know.  The donkeys.  Your coffees, whatever.  And you don't really ever fucking ring it up.  But if you have to constantly give receipts out, there's records of every fucking sale. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, I thought there was something.  So they don't give a fuck about...  Oh, you know what?  I was wondering what that was before.  They don't give a fuck about the customers.  No.  That's what that's for.  They're trying to keep the fucking stealing down from their own employees.  You give the people their shit, and then you just pocket the cash.  Of course.  We all learned that when you had those horrible jobs.  That's a good gag.  Ah, the register's stuck.  We got someone working on that.  Oh, yeah.  Man.  Before our fucking security cameras, the world ruled. 
[01:26:30]  Ah, the stealing, the ability to steal.  So fucking good.  Look at that Lou Ferrigno.  He looks good.  Yeah.  And I see the other side of what's going on.  Of course you do.  You don't hear it.  My father was a lieutenant of New York City.  Look at those ashtrays on the side of his head.  That's why you have all your pins.  What?  Well, these are from other sheriffs in California.  So I have like 50 of them.  That's great.  Now, do you have...  California has 52 sheriffs.  We were just talking about the NSA situation with the leaking.  A lot... 
[01:27:00]  Leaking.  Aside from that, a lot of people are absolutely frustrated.  They're all facing us.  We can read their lips.  Anyone else notice they're subtly talking louder?  Louder.  But not too loud where they're assaulting the guy?  They provide memory upgrades.  Any computer.  Any memory upgrades.  Because a lot of times you go to a hotel, you're by yourself, and you want to go online  with the computer.  And you can't make the connection because you're out of memory.  But this company can provide any memory upgrade for any computer to speed up the memory.  So it's crucial. 
[01:27:30]  Crucial.com.  Yeah.  And you have a contest.  Yes, it's called toughoncomputers.com.  Whoever makes a loudest war is going to pay $5,000.  So if you send your video in, it's a loudest war.  The loudest war?  Can you imagine that?  That's great.  What the fuck is he going to know?  I know.  Could you explain to them what it's like to flex and then rip your clothes off?  Because we've both had that experience.  Arnold?  Arnold, sorry, Lou.  What is it like?  He called him Arnold?  How small are the clothes? 
[01:28:00]  Tight.  I mean, tight, but I got it.  And you would just, it would just rip all its hands off.  It's all getting hot.  Yes, he's hot.  Man, the wardrobe budget on that show must have killed you.  Oh, I've done 90 episodes.  They're showing Bill Bixby.  500 shirts.  Take it from the top.  We didn't get that one, Lou.  They're not even showing them.  They're showing up Bill Bixby.  But still today, the show holds its own. 
[01:28:30]  I mean, they have CGI.  Now he's like, right, Lou?  The show doesn't hold its own.  Yeah, Lou, good point, Lou.  Thanks a lot, Lou.  Lou Grant.  Absolutely.  The show doesn't hold its own.  It's not even on TV anymore.  I know.  What are you talking about?  Netflix, that shit.  No one wants to see that Hulk anymore.  It doesn't hold its own.  You want to see Avengers Hulk.  Yeah, the Hulk in the Avengers is far more relevant.  Fucking awesome.  Like, the illusion of his power is right there.  And this one, it was like, oh, look.  He's big. 
[01:29:00]  He's going to slow motion flip a car over.  Right.  Poorly.  Yeah.  I wonder if the green paint is going to get rubbed off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's not fucking jumping and smashing through entire buildings.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  Hey, man, Chris.  Kick that out of my head.  When I was a kid, it was very cute.  Instead of the bionic man, I would say the Bukkani man.  Why?  I just liked saying that.  You're the Bukkake man.  Fucking Jimmy. 
[01:29:30]  God damn, man.  I love your fucking old school shit when you were a kid.  You were such a little weirdo.  A little Jimmy, a little weirdo.  The Bukkaki kids.  You've got to squeeze in Dunkin' Donuts, lady, because we got Robert Zimmerman on the way.  Yes.  George Zimmerman's brother coming in in a few minutes. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  So back to this lady just being a twat.  I thanked you for that.  This girl was so fucking rude to me.  Oh.  And said, okay, well, you can get your order free next time.  So you know what I told her?  I said, I want the whole fucking menu, bitch.  Twice.  Give me your manager's number, the owner, now, because they're guaranteed.  It's a guarantee, and I've already called my lawyer, and he's already on it.  So when it says you don't get a receipt, you get your order free, it fucking means it, right?  You've already eaten most of it.  Or is it a lie?  Because this is all being recorded.  No, that's true. 
[01:30:30]  Because I don't know what happened yesterday, so.  Is there a video camera there?  Because I should get my order free.  I already talked to someone earlier, and they already said I can have my order free today.  Ugh.  And it's already on video record.  Yeah, you talked to Munira, right?  Yeah.  In the morning?  Yeah.  I'll give you your order free.  Okay.  So, whatever you ordered yesterday, I can give it to you to be, or.  Pull it back up.  It's just being completely.  Or, do you want to tell me what it is?  Yeah.  I'll make it for you.  Okay.  So the guy, obviously, is being very nice.  Being reasonable.  He's like, alright, look.  Yeah.  We'll give you your fucking stupid coffee. 
[01:31:00]  He's going above and beyond.  Yeah.  And dumb egg sandwich, whatever it is, for free today.  Yeah.  He couldn't be nicer in this situation.  I love when people come in, and their self-importance is amazing.  Like, she's thinking they're going to look at the video surveillance to see if she was treated.  Those cameras are for when someone walks in and shoves a gun in your face.  Of course.  Dummy.  And then, you know, you've got to kind of grab the coffee pot, and you fling hot coffee in  his face. 
[01:31:30]  And it's awesome.  Totally awesome.  Totally awesome.  Yes.  Hi, Facebook.  This is what you have to do in life.  It fucking sucks.  Blow my brains out.  I cannot wait to post this.  I cannot wait to post this?  Why?  Really?  So you could look like a dummy and be on radio shows and everything else.  It's hard to see.  She was pointing it at the register.  She turned it to herself a couple of times.  I literally thought this was the best one in the city, and I gave you guys so many good  remarks online, because I have a business degree, and I really did.  A business degree.  She crossed the line. 
[01:32:00]  I'm very sorry about that.  This is all being recorded and posted on Facebook, because they failed to give me a receipt last  time, so my order is free.  This guy couldn't be nicer.  It's about to get posted.  So this guy doesn't know what's going on.  He's just standing there.  She wants a moment.  Yeah, that's it.  And I actually wanted my iced coffee.  Now she's just talking to another customer in the store.  I have made nothing but good complaints about this.  She's recording this other customer, and he's just like, eh, meh.  She's trying for a moment, you know?  They're the best.  They're the best.  Last night she forgot to give me a receipt. 
[01:32:30]  Ugh, gives a shit.  You can have your order free tomorrow.  And I said, well, then I'm with the whole fucking menu truck, and she said, we'd be meaning  to call in it.  And she gave me the guy's number, and then they wouldn't answer.  Like, why do you think I give a fuck?  Yeah.  Unless she was hot, then I'd be going, oh, really?  Yeah.  What'd you have, hon?  Yeah.  They should.  And I'm about to take off and watch this Dunkin' Donuts explode if they were to keep  being bitchy.  She looks like a fucking wacko.  Those big, dumb eyes.  Yeah, she looks crazy.  So then she found the employee.  Too bad, though. 
[01:33:00]  She found the employee that pissed her off.  Oh, she did?  Yes.  Look out.  The last clip here.  Okay.  In the trilogy.  Look out.  I'm still recording all of this.  And even if they hock a loogie and shit in it, I don't even care.  Because one time they pissed in my fries where I'm from at home.  Literally, I could smell the piss in it.  Yay.  So I know they probably are spitting and shitting and doing everything in it, because  they really, really don't give a fuck.  They really don't.  That's why I'm not eating this food, and I'm giving it to my boyfriend.  I can't trust them anymore.  You can't trust them, but you're going to give it to your boyfriend? 
[01:33:30]  Give it to my boyfriend.  Self-important douche.  Yeah.  Cut.  So many good, like, so many good recommendations.  Over a hundred.  Like, after, like, ten, after ten, after ten, after ten, after ten.  Would you ever accept a recommendation about how great Dunkin' Donuts is?  No.  Who cares?  But she gave over a hundred of them.  Who cares?  Who gives a fuck?  Like, that's really spiking their business?  I got ten, after ten, after ten, after ten, after ten, until that bitch crossed my line. 
[01:34:00]  Like, why would she do that to me?  Are you Nidie?  Pretty obvious why.  Yeah.  What's your name?  Is Nidie going to still be working here after this?  No, we're going to fire her.  Oh.  Well, guess what?  This shit's about to go live, bitch.  Right on Facebook.  Because I already posted what your dumb ass did last night.  So I hope you're happy with your little fucking fan nigger self.  Oh.  Oh, she went there. 
[01:34:30]  I'd kick her right out of that fucking place.  Oh, she went there.  She had a wonderful fucking person.  She made it racial.  I guess the woman looked to be of some type of Arab descent.  She's maybe Indian.  Who knows what she was.  Yeah, it could have been anything.  You fucking pig.  Oh, she's being a real...  Oh, yeah.  But she really looks like a cunt.  Oh, yeah.  With your little fucking fan nigger self.  Because I'm about to nuke your whole fucking planet from Mars.  You think y'all are tough, big fat of Arab's bum in the trade center? 
[01:35:00]  I'll show you tough.  I'm not done.  You didn't give me my water.  You didn't give me my fucking culotta.  No, no.  I made it.  Okay, well, here you go.  Where is it?  I'd throw it on the floor in front of her.  There it is.  Get the fuck out.  Why are they appeasing this cunt?  Because they failed to give me a receipt yesterday.  And then they failed to give me the guarantee where it was supposed to be free.  So I had to do this.  This is all on video.  And it's all going to be on the internet.  Well, good for you.  Enjoy the comments.  She's right, though.  She's fucking right.  Oh, you think so? 
[01:35:30]  I love her.  You're a good judge of what the situation is all about there, Chipper.  Yeah, she was saying that they didn't do something.  How's the comments?  Okay, a lot of dislikes.  Yeah.  Not much sympathy for her?  No.  What a dumb fucking little whore.  First, first, all.  She can't afford a lawyer at all.  What a dumb twat.  I hope you choke on your fucking donut.  Yeah, someone kill it before it lays eggs.  Yeah, it goes on and on and on and on.  All right, good. 
[01:36:00]  Wow.  Yeah, she pulled that racist shit out of her hat there.  Damn.  These poor people are just working at Dunkin' Donuts.  Please, right?  And then they have to deal with this piece of shit.  We should break so we can clear the field.  Yes.  Robert Zimmerman.  Yes.  The show is about to get very busy.  We got Robert Zimmerman.  We have Kirk Fox, who's on my episode of Who Gets the Last Laugh,  which is on tonight at 10 on TBS. 
[01:36:30]  And then we got Ozzy and Geezer.  Yes.  So.  Stay tuned.  Well, now we got to do intros for tomorrow's podcast.  Oh, we do.  Podcast number five will be up tomorrow, right?  Yep.  Very cool.  I'm going to be completely honest with you.  I don't know your name.  The Opin' Anthony Show.  On Serious X.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[01:37:00]  I just want to say one thing, y'all.  I want to say one thing.  This is the Opin' Anthony Show.  Opin' Anthony Show.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Cause here comes Uncle Paul. 
[01:37:30]  Let me show you how to make a big boy love ya.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul recalls his favorite Jordache commercial.  Yay!  That was Timothy and Amber.  She would always jump up.  I'd say, you got the look.  And she'd go, I want to know better.  And I'd say, you got the look.  And she'd say something.  And I'd put her face in the pillow.  Like, yeah, we'd all dance Jordache.  And slide them down.  Sure.  I'd say, let me smell that word. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, I could always tell when she'd been running around.  Cause her little feet would smell.  And sometimes Jordache in that little middle scene  keeps the smell of the privacy.  Yeah, the jeans would just keep that in there.  Scrub-a-dub-dub.  Somebody's becoming a woman.  They're so young, their bodies are confused.  The body don't know what it's doing.  I bet she was jogging around the playground. 
[01:38:30]  You fall off the jungle, Jim?  I smell a little copper.  My dad says when we're in my room, we have to keep the door open.  Jordache Basics.  I'm not going to do anything different if the door's not open.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy staring.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Cause here comes Uncle Paul.  On the next American War Stories. 
[01:39:00]  Battleground.  Iraq.  Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant realizes no man can prepare for war.  We thought we were going to starve.  So we like brought like little like bars and stuff like there's going to be no food.  There was more.  I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  There was.  You go to the buffet.  There's Chinese food.  Mac and cheese.  Barbecue.  Pizza.  Ice cream.  You could walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and sunnies as you want. 
[01:39:30]  But no matter how rich the rewards, every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there.  I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more.  So tune in as we chronicle the victories and the defeats for American hero, Bob Kelly.  I broke my knee, man.  On the next American War Stories. 
[01:40:00]  And now back to The O.B. and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Still waiting for Robert Zimmerman to show up.  George Zimmerman's brother. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, apparently we weren't even able to say something yesterday.  Because everywhere he gets booked, they never really announce.  Because there's a lot of people that wish to do the Zimmerman family bodily harm, which is pretty crazy.  Pretty crazy.  And he was up for, I guess, Piers Morgan last night.  And he's flying back to Florida after this to sit in on the trial a little more. 
[01:41:00]  Is the family in hiding?  No.  They're in the courtroom.  No, I mean, when they're not in a courtroom.  No.  I don't know.  How does that work?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  See, I've got to answer things like this.  Like, Robert Zimmerman is George Zimmerman's worst enemy.  How is that?  He's defending his brother on the Twitter.  Right.  I don't know.  Well, that shit is, you know, going to be involved in the case or anything. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  Don't worry about that.  I guess the defense was trying to get some video that was on Trayvon's phone entered into evidence.  It's Trayvon recording two other guys fighting.  You know, and they're talking and, you know, shit like that.  And they initially said, no, you can't have that in there.  Now they're trying to get it put in as a voice example for Trayvon. 
[01:42:00]  So it's like, all right, they're trying to, like, backdoor it, I guess they were calling it.  Right.  And get it put into evidence as something else.  But meanwhile, if the jury sees it, they might get a little more of a line on what he was about and stuff like that.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Interesting goings on going on.  Why don't they allow just everything?  Hey, there's plenty of shit that.  They just don't trust the jurors enough, right?  Is that what that's about?  I think technically they don't want to confuse the issue. 
[01:42:30]  Right.  Certain things aren't admissible because they aren't relevant to the case.  Right.  They'll always argue that certain things aren't relevant to the case, even though it seems like it is.  I think a lot of the...  But if it's not relevant to the case, the jurors should be smart enough to go, ah, that's just horseshit.  Well, they say why should it then even be presented?  Well, but let the jurors fucking, you know, work through all that.  Well, it's like a rape victim.  Like, they say you can't, no matter what her sexual history is, you can't bring it up.  They just don't think it's relevant.  Certain times, prior behaviors, if you're, can be counted. 
[01:43:00]  Other times, they can.  It's really weird.  Yeah, I know I understand what it's all about in the end, but I don't know.  Yeah, I think, I honestly think some of those texts and whatnot are relevant to the case.  If you can show that maybe Trayvon had a certain aggressive nature for a penchant for fighting or whatnot, you know, I think that would be relevant.  But apparently they say, at least in the opening arguments, they're not. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, I don't know if they are or not, to be honest with you.  I don't know.  Yeah, I could probably be convinced either way.  Yeah.  So he's only doing our show in Piers Morgan.  Did he do anybody else in New York?  No, that's it.  He flew in, flew out.  Just because you have a little relationship with the guy online?  I have a nice little rapport with him on Twitter.  I definitely support his brother, you know, from, and I've definitely been keeping tabs probably more than a lot of people on the case. 
[01:44:00]  I'm not sitting in the court.  I'm not saying that.  Coax and Pepsi's till.  Oh, boy.  So I think it's very important.  I think this is a very important case to, you know, your right to defend yourself.  And I think there's such a racial aspect to this whole thing that's in play right now that I think is clouding some people's view of what true justice is. 
[01:44:30]  More importantly, he's late.  He is late.  He's very late.  I know.  He's 17 minutes late.  But it's New York.  It's raining.  I don't know.  Is it raining out there?  Extreme close-up.  Hey.  Camera's in my face.  Yeah, it's like a...  Oh, fucking Chip.  You can move it wherever you want.  You can move the camera wherever you want.  If Chip shows up during this interview, I might be in court for the same reason. 
[01:45:00]  If Chip shows up?  Oh, God.  So what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  Yeah.  Pick a card.  Yeah.  What is he doing?  Jesus.  Right?  We got Gary Busey acting all crazy and shit.  We can play this as we wait for Robert.  Is that something exclusive?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's exclusive to our show.  Is it?  Yeah.  Everyone knows he's pretty fucking normal when he's on TV. 
[01:45:30]  But we got a different version of him.  That's right.  Gary Busey is a different kind of man.  That's me.  I'm surrounded by angels.  Those angels were giving me information to say.  They go home after shampooing somebody's puppy, but they didn't know it.  And they were gold, white light, and they were moving like they were breathing.  And out of that light came an androgynous voice that spoke to me and thought.  He said, you're in a beautiful place. 
[01:46:00]  You are going in the right direction.  You may come with us now.  Or you can return to your body and learn how to kill lions with a short spear.  But for the responsibility you have coming up in you, you must look for help in the spiritual realm.  I'm recording a CD with some of Buddy Holly's songs no one's heard before.  It's wasted time.  It's wasted effort to write something that doesn't have to be righted because it's already right. 
[01:46:30]  Nothing is difficult for this cowboy.  Hey, hey, I'm high and I'm dry.  I'm looking for some bozo to put me in the water.  And that is the intergalactic communication value.  Oh, yeah.  I was only about a foot long and a quarter of an inch wide.  And that's the size of your soul.  And your soul is housed in the column of your spine. 
[01:47:00]  It's like explaining an orgasm to a 10-year-old.  So be careful when you come at me growling.  I'll get you.  And you'll be floating on air.  And the word float, F-L-O-A-T, stands for feeling light on air today.  It's your choice.  I'm running the money with my truth.  That's what you get when you buy that dinner.  Figure it out.  It'll come to you later.  Fucking love it. 
[01:47:30]  Wow.  I love it.  That was creepy.  I love it.  And artistic.  And a lot going on there.  I think that could be turned into a little animation.  A lot for the palate right there.  Who wants to take that on?  Coke Logic, you want to take that on?  Could be.  Wow.  It kind of has that cups.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Drinking from cups.  Drinking from cups.  Has that kind of feel to it.  Wow.  He is fucking. 
[01:48:00]  I think if that was animated, it would do pretty well.  Yeah, yeah.  What was he talking about, though?  Oh, yeah.  I knew it perfectly.  I don't know.  And his little beautyisms.  What are those things where he takes float, feeling light on air.  And then he didn't have a good one for the T.  What was the T?  Today.  Well, it's not today.  Well, why not?  It should have been something else.  Yeah.  He lost me with the T on that.  It's like float, feeling light on air. 
[01:48:30]  It's like, all right, all right.  Today.  It's like, oh, you found a T where you didn't even try.  Should have been, like, floating light on air.  Titties.  Titties.  Titties.  Now, Robert Zimmerman is 20 minutes late.  Oh, man.  The only reason I keep saying this, because I am wondering if he's already on his way back to Florida. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, man.  I will be very angry.  No.  Do we know?  No.  Any word from Roland?  Not yet.  No, man.  Let me call Roland.  Man.  Call Roland.  Call Roland.  Let's see what Roland is.  Because now we're just kind of in the middle of Florida.  Yeah, it's weird.  Yeah.  Can't really do anything until we know what the fuck's going on with Robert Zimmerman.  Well, people are speculating you had to walk past the Shade 45 studio.  Perhaps they dragged him in there. 
[01:49:30]  Hello?  Hi, Roland.  Hi, Roland.  It's Opie Anthony and Jim Norton.  How are you?  All right.  We're wondering if Mr. Zimmerman is in the building.  Yes?  Oh, we're asking.  No, no.  What?  I'm downstairs waiting for him.  Oh, I thought he said yes.  Yeah, I thought he said yes, too.  So, he's 20 minutes late.  Is he still in New York City?  I don't know.  I sent out emails and everything to wait in your back. 
[01:50:00]  I haven't heard anything.  I sent her back when it's at 10 at night.  That says see you tomorrow.  Okay.  So, he's not showing up today.  That's obvious.  Oh, he has to.  So, we can move on to other things.  We could just play clips from his appearance on MSNBC yesterday.  But it's...  Can I...  I don't think he was on Piers Morgan last night.  He was on MSNBC.  No, I saw a Piers Morgan thing and it said who was going to be on and I saw his name. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, I don't think...  There's no video of him on...  Yeah, I don't think he was...  Wasn't he on MSNBC?  He was on MSNBC but not in studio with him.  Let me check my messages.  Let me check...  Oh, boy.  See if I got something here.  So...  Check your fucking messages.  Oh, oh.  Right, Frank?  Yeah.  It's hard to hear you, guys, Gary.  The cell service sucks.  What?  What?  He said I...  It's hard to hear you because the cell service here is fucked.  All right.  Well, now you know how we feel.  Yeah, Roland.  How do you ever feel?  It's fucking crazy.  Trying to get people on the phone. 
[01:51:00]  We can't get anything done around this place.  How do you think we feel, Roland?  Okay.  All right, Roland.  All right.  What do you think?  Do you think this is happening?  I don't see him yet.  Once I do, I'll text Travis.  All right.  He did tweet that he's doing the show.  Oh, did he?  When did he tweet that?  12 hours ago.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hmm?  Because he said it's coming from a circle, so...  Roland, is that him right there? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  That guy.  Take a look.  Right there.  Yeah.  The guy booing the black security guard.  All right.  Well, keep us updated, Roland.  All right.  Maybe we could call Barry Williams if we have time to kill.  Where are you going to watch your TBS show tonight?  Will you watch it at home, or are you going to watch it with family, or are you just going  to not watch it and watch it after?  This is how people...  I might not even watch it.  Why?  Because I'm always worried about stuff when it's on.  Yeah.  I don't know.  No, we'll probably just watch it. 
[01:52:00]  Yes, Anthony, you have the right to defend yourself.  That's why Trayvon attacked his stalker.  How could you even say...  That doesn't classify as stalking.  And there's no...  If someone's following you, you're not allowed to punch them.  You're not allowed to put your hands on someone, even if they're following you down the street.  So regardless, I'm not even saying he was, but even if he was following him, you can't...  Defend yourself like that, using physical force, against somebody that is following you. 
[01:52:30]  And stalking is quite the leap from a neighborhood watch guy getting out of a vehicle and trying  to see where a guy that he has suspicions about is going after he called the cops already  and wanting to keep tabs on where this guy's going.  And trying to say that's stalking?  What was he, fucking picked him out?  Oh, there's this Trayvon guy I've been following for months.  There he is.  Let me follow him some more. 
[01:53:00]  So just stop with the fucking wording trying to make this something it wasn't.  He wasn't stalking him.  He wasn't defending himself against an attacker.  If anyone was attacked, it was Zimmerman.  You're shouting.  Oh, because these people are morons.  They're morons.  They know nothing of the case.  They know nothing of self-defense case law.  They're fucking assholes that are so emotionally invested in it that they don't take any time 
[01:53:30]  to realize what's really happening and what the case is really about.  Fuck.  Ah.  Ugh.  People.  How's your dinosaur?  There was a line of people taking pictures by it.  I saw Troy Kwan, his bitches.  They were all lined up just waiting to take pictures of the dinosaur.  Yeah.  Ah, these Twitter people.  Yeah, there's a lot of dopes on Twitter. 
[01:54:00]  Let's be really honest.  They just don't really get it.  Oh, my God.  Let's see.  Is it Zimmerman tweets?  No?  I don't know what's going on.  He should have been here already.  I wonder what changed.  Oh, boy.  It's kind of, you know, where's maybe a phone call to Roland?  Do I have phone?  Yeah, look.  I got the mouthpiece as a number.  I forgot his mouthpiece, maybe. 
[01:54:30]  Give the Esquire a call.  Let me see.  Give the Esquire a call and see what he says.  Esquire.  Hey, there.  Give the Esquire a call and see what he says.  He DM'd me.  Is that what he did?  Let me see.  Roland just texted.  He has Robert.  They're on the way up.  Oh, boy.  Hey.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  He's coming upstairs.  He's coming upstairs.  He's coming upstairs. 
[01:55:00]  Bobo, what do you think of that?  Bobo, what do you think, Bobo?  Bobo, Robert's coming upstairs.  It's a big deal.  He's coming in the studio.  Oh, a footnote to the party.  Bobo, of course, wanted to go to my party.  How was he as a guest?  Well, I left it to the Twitter audience and said, you guys decide whether he should be able  to come or not.  And they actually decided that he should.  Because they would have liked to have seen some pictures and stories and stuff.  That's very nice.  So I put on Twitter, I said, okay, you can come.  I immediately got tweeted from Bobo, I don't have a ride. 
[01:55:30]  How do I get there?  Can I get a ride?  Can someone pick me up?  Is there a way?  I'll take the train and a cab.  I don't have money.  I can't get...  So it was just like all that.  He pounded.  He's like, please, people, vote for me to go to the party.  I want to go to the party.  Can I go to the party?  Please let me go to the party.  The idiot has no ride.  Okay, you can go to the party.  I can't get to the party.  He's exhausting.  You're the only one that still deals with him.  Well, you know.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do? 
[01:56:00]  He's a fool.  He's a fool.  Bobo's a fool.  He is a baffune.  Definitely.  What's going on with this whole thing?  Oh, no.  Oh, don't.  It's a clarity, please.  What the fuck with that?  Does it sound like I knew about sports last night?  Yeah.  You don't, though.  I had to fake it.  You did fake it, right?  What did you say?  Just like hacky sport things?  I liked your little voice at first.  What do you mean?  Well, you had this going. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, really?  You got a couple of gulps, which was adorable.  Were you nervous?  I don't know if I was nervous because I was comfortable around her.  It looked like you were signing with your hands.  Yeah, I'm a fidgety guy.  You are fidgeting with your hands.  How sexy is she?  There.  Oh, my God.  Michelle Bela is sexy, man.  She looked really good yesterday, too.  She has great legs.  Oh, she's fantastic.  She looked good on cam.  She is fantastic.  Yeah.  Did you see the, was it Justin Stangles?  You know how behind you, people's tweets are going? 
[01:57:00]  And there's a, someone's screen capped, Justin Stangles' tweet was behind you guys.  Oh, really?  What did it say?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It was just something about sports.  Why don't, why don't you bring your clips to our show?  Oh, shit.  We're saving them for the extra show.  It was Eric Stangles.  Oh, I heard something.  I heard a niggle in my head.  It seems very, uh, self-indulgent.  Well, it's part of the show.  I guess.  Yeah, we're all self-indulgent in the end.  I can give you clips.  We want some.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  I want it for home use.  I want a Sam party. 
[01:57:30]  Why'd they play, like, the episode twice in a row?  They always do that with the crossover.  I don't know.  It's kind of weird.  It was so good.  Because they don't have a lot of programming over there.  Maybe, no.  Actually, I think Jim's right.  They usually don't do that, but they really like the episode.  Oh, yeah.  They wanted me to do a show, and I said no, because I don't believe in that, uh, channel.  NBC.  You don't believe in NBC Sports?  NBC Sports channel, you know?  Yeah, they wanted me to do it where I pick all my teams.  Yeah?  Yeah, I give them my picks.  We're going to call it Jimmy's Picks of the Week, but spell picks P-I-X.  That's good. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, with my suggestion, it'll catch people.  Jimmy's Picks of the Week.  From 8 to 8.10.  Only on Thursday.  No, I thought you did pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  How come not great?  Well, no, he was very natural.  Oh, thank you.  Except for the gulping and the fidgeting.  Well, the gulping, and you fell into it, like, very quickly.  Once you got a good laugh and stuff, then, you know, you were like, all right, I could  do this.  Gotcha.  At first, and I love the fidgety hands.  He was doing what's called washing the hands, where it's almost like a sling blade thing. 
[01:58:30]  Right.  Yeah.  You were doing that, and then you were praying.  You were doing a, here's the church, here's the steeple, open the door, see all the people.  Right.  All of that.  That, and then you were kind of just doing a, you were really distorting your hands.  At one point, you literally had one arm bent and shoved onto your leg, and the other one  was against the arm of the couch.  I was like, what is he, he's, like, deforming himself.  And then just leaning in, like, casually listening.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was fascinated just by what you were doing with your arms and stuff. 
[01:59:00]  But more importantly, what did Mrs. Roberts think?  Oh, my God.  What did she think?  There it is.  Why aren't you asking the real questions here?  My mom called me, and she said, did I, did, she said, I thought you would do great, but  you were just phenomenal.  Woo!  Woo!  Nice.  And she said, and you have real chemistry with Michelle.  You and me.  Are you thinking co-host?  Co-host? 
[01:59:30]  I was like, thank you, Mom.  Perhaps.  And Jess, I guess, broke out the binoculars to see it on your television.  Is that what happened?  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  Entering the studio, Robert Zimmerman, George Zimmerman's brother.  Gentlemen.  How you doing, man?  Pleasure.  It's Slavo!  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Robert's lawyer, of course.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  She just dropped the Slavo on E-Rod.  We're on. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, yeah, we're right on the air.  How are you?  Pleasure.  What's up, Robert?  Opie over here.  How are you, buddy?  Can I call you Opie?  How are you, sir?  Opie.  Mr. Kumia.  Yes.  How you doing, man?  Very well.  Pleasure to meet you, finally.  Pleasure to meet you.  When are you?  Are you going back to Florida today?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  Yeah, my spot on CNN got bumped.  Oh, it did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It definitely did.  Uh-huh.  Was that a political reason, or?  No, I think he just did one of those live audience shows, and the audience took a lot  of time to ask very simple questions. 
[02:00:30]  I gotcha.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So what's going on?  Anything happening in court today?  Yeah, I'm...  Still jury selection?  Still jury selection.  The Fry hearing has not concluded, so there's not a conclusive decision about the expert testimony.  And we'll see, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  It was just, ah, it's such a chore, like, watching these, because it's really a grind. 
[02:01:00]  It just seems to, and I'm sure you guys obviously want this resolved as quickly as possible.  And then to watch some of this line of questioning going, like, it's so tedious.  It's so tedious.  There's a juror consultant, which is, you know, a specialist in selecting jurors, which is just,  it's uncanny.  But it's, um, hopefully we get to justice, you know?  And hopefully there's a, um, a result.  I hope the result is respected.  That's what I really...  Right, right. 
[02:01:30]  Now, obviously, the emotions attached to this case, a lot of times, things like this transcend  facts and transcend actual justice.  Uh, your concerns about that?  My concerns about that, I don't want to sound overly, uh, legal, but there are, um, there  are what are called lesser included offenses and things like that.  Um, for example, if you are charged with murder too, you can be convicted with manslaughter  or negligent manslaughter. 
[02:02:00]  And my concern with that is that sometimes juries don't exist in a vacuum.  When you're on jury duty for two weeks or three weeks at a time, somebody notices, you know,  somebody realizes you're not going to work.  Somebody realizes you're not walking the dog or somebody realizes you're not doing whatever  you would have been doing, you know, every day.  And then, uh, you know how the news is.  Yeah.  Is it one of these 30 people?  And then is it one of these 10?  And we think it might be one of these eight or whatever, you know?  So I, I think that sometimes, um, in a case like this or others, juries have, um, they 
[02:02:30]  have pressure.  I think jurors can rise to the occasion.  And I believe in the way that our system is set up, but I, I, I certainly, as a family  member, I'm concerned that they might have, uh, a lot of pressure to do something as it  were.  Right, right.  Something.  Now, now that isn't true justice.  Uh, that's trying to compromise somebody's legal right.  I don't, I don't think it would be a factor, but for the racial element that has been kind 
[02:03:00]  of woven into this whole story.  Exactly, yes, yes.  Can I ask you one, what, what is the, how frustrating is it to see the media doing, behaving, because  no matter what side of the case, people, the media has been fairly repulsive so far.  This is, some of Robert's biggest complaints on, on Twitter and stuff is the way the media  has handled this.  That's where the bulk of that real anger is, right?  The editing of that audio, regardless, the editing of that audio is unforgivable.  Yeah.  And it's clear what the intention of it was. 
[02:03:30]  Absolutely, yeah, it's been repulsive, and I think one of the things that has happened  to me is that I was, I was kind of, uh, you know, protesting by myself, but now looking  back, I have like a year to look back on of people saying the same thing, and I've been  listening to this for a long time, and I'm kind of now just repeating or summarizing what  people's frustrations are.  It's not just me.  You could go to a cut and paste list of answers to some of these people, because they, it's  the same, uh, inaccurate, uh, information that they're, and it's been dispelled, uh, by 
[02:04:00]  a lot of people, yet they don't want to accept that that never happened, this is the way it  went down.  Uh, and as all this evidence comes in, especially during the court case, people will still not  want to believe it, not even look at it, and they'd rather go off, uh, ill-informed, uh,  because it better fits their emotional, um, response to this whole thing.  Yeah, putting, putting fact before emotion is difficult, especially when emotion has been 
[02:04:30]  so misinformed for so long, but, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll see what happens.  Have they, have they mischaracterized your brother too?  I mean, whenever you see a family member being, or a friend being talked about publicly, I  think it's probably rare that they get it right.  Yeah, I don't think it's only mischaracterized.  I think there was kind of this vacuum at the beginning of information.  There was kind of like this black hole made around George and everybody got to fill in  their, you know, mythological version of George that was not anything, uh, like George. 
[02:05:00]  Um, but George has, he's a real person.  He met the jurors yesterday and questioning, and I think that's important because they  can see that he's not just some news story or some, you know, icon on the screen that  flashes by with a narrative.  He's a real human being.  It is hard to see that, but a real person, I mean, a lot of people following, uh, this  case, uh, you know, it's the guy on TV, it's that picture, it's, you know, uh, one photograph,  uh, and, you know, it's, that's your brother.  This is your family.  Right, exactly. 
[02:05:30]  And it's gotta be weird too.  You're regular citizens.  Like, you're not meant to be like, you know, on the news and like, you're just a regular  dude going to work and the next thing you know, your brother's in the news and you're  on CNN talking about your brother who's like, like, what a, what a, what a reality shift  that, I mean, and you know, Trayvon Martin's family too, I'm sure has the same thing.  All of a sudden the regular people, this tragedy, and now they're on television, kind of quasi  celebrities talking about what's going on.  Right.  I think it's a, it's, it's, I've characterized it before as a reluctant duty, but it's not just  a duty to my brother. 
[02:06:00]  I think it's a duty to my country because I don't want to see people charged with crimes,  uh, without probable cause simply to appease the masses.  I don't think that's the right thing to do.  And I think that's what happened here and I'll continue to be vocal about it each and  every time it happens.  And what is the, what is the, the exact, you guys are, you're half Mexican, half white or  whatever.  What is your makeup?  Because they were going with the white and they could, what's that?  What?  White Hispanic.  White Hispanic.  White Hispanic.  They could not, I've never heard that term used. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  Until this case, they couldn't get white into it fast enough.  It didn't fit the narrative any other way.  They need a white on black crime.  Right.  That's what they wanted.  Um, and they heard the name Zimmerman.  So they're like, Oh, okay, this is great.  And then you guys turn out to be Hispanic.  Right.  And, and they're like, wait a minute.  No, no, no.  Let's get rid of that whole part.  Yeah.  That irony kind of repeated our whole life of our mom being very Hispanic from Peru. 
[02:07:00]  She does not look white.  She is not white.  You know, so sometimes we'd be in school or at the doctor's office and they'd say, you  know, Mrs. Zimmerman.  And she'd get up with her kids and they'd look at her like, Oh, this poor lady doesn't  speak English, you know, or whatever.  And, um, they'd be like, no, no, no.  We said Mrs. Zimmerman.  Oh no.  She's like, yeah.  Yeah.  That's me.  That's me.  Right.  But that's that kind of, I mean, it was like the inverse where now we had that name  meant white, you know, right away. 
[02:07:30]  And, and, and we did not, uh, retroactively inject race and say, wait, but we're Hispanic  because I think that's kind of a moot point and kind of draws more.  It sure is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the other half of the family?  White.  But what?  Like German?  German white.  Zimmerman.  It's, that's where our name comes from.  That's what I figured.  It's German.  Okay.  Just making sure.  So half German, half Hispanic.  That's right.  Now is this, uh, I heard this jury is not sequestered.  The pool is not sequestered.  The order as it stands, my understanding is that it is not sequestered thus far, though 
[02:08:00]  the court may readdress that at some other point, but the, um, cause it's such a volatile  kind of atmosphere differences and advantages and disadvantages.  Sometimes when you have a sequestered jury, for example, people may figure out that you're  just gone, you know, for three weeks, four weeks at a time when, when the jury is not  sequestered, you can go home and go back to work as it were, you know, on the jury.  So they may not figure out necessarily that you're doing jury duty and, and there are, 
[02:08:30]  you know, there's, there's advantages and disadvantages.  So we'll see how it plays out.  But definitely I, I would have preferred just speaking as a family member, the, um, what's  called the veneer or the, or the pool to be sequestered.  Because I think that the objective seemingly is for the, for the jury to have some kind of  anonymity, but when you don't have that pool of 500 people sequestered to begin with, I  think you lose any real anonymity in reality.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And, and, and you're right about one thing, and I've had mixed feelings about this case, 
[02:09:00]  to be very honest.  Anthony's a hundred percent for your brother.  And I played devil's advocate too, but I really, to be totally honest, I'm very, I  don't know how to feel about it.  There's times where I feel like he was wrong and there's times where I feel like, yeah,  man, it's just an unfortunate thing, but he was defending his own life.  And I don't know how, I think a lot of people don't know how to see this.  Like you, you only know what's being said from both sides.  And it's like, I can't get a definitive 100% opinion on it.  Right.  Again, if you, if, I think if you look at it emotionally, you're going to have much more 
[02:09:30]  of a difficult time, um, assessing what happened and the legality of it.  If you do look at it legally and look at the evidence that, uh, is, is being presented.  And, and I think you get more of a line that, yes, here's a man who felt, felt his life was  in danger and, and being, being threatened to be taken away from him and defended himself,  uh, in kind and, and saved his life.  That's, that's the legal part of this. 
[02:10:00]  Did that happen?  Right.  Uh, now emotionally, you could be like, well, was he just a boy with, uh, you know, uh, with,  uh, iced tea and Skittles?  Uh, he's unarmed.  Was he this sweet kid?  Uh, did Zimmerman, was he walking around like he was the, you know, the, the boss of this  block or something?  All that is, is this peripheral interference.  And, and I think if you could try to weed that out, you get much more of an accurate  depiction of what happened and, and where this should go, uh, when, when this trial does 
[02:10:30]  end.  Well, yeah.  And it's also hard to get like, cause when you look at like the fact that he had the  back of the head injury and like the press just didn't want to show that.  So that actually makes me think that, that Zimmerman's telling more of the truth.  Yeah.  Neither did seemingly the state because it took them a long time to get that image produced  from a black and white grainy photograph to the actual full color, high definition image  of what George actually looked like in the back of that police car.  Again, it didn't fit the narrative of, of first of all, why he was even arrested after, 
[02:11:00]  you know, I guess the police that were on the scene and, uh, from witnesses that, uh, gave  their account to the police on the scene.  Um, obviously they decided he was justified in what he did.  Um, at least, uh, maybe a grand jury could look at it or whatnot, but, but at that time  they didn't deem it necessary to arrest him.  And I think that they would have wanted any shred of probable cause to arrest him. 
[02:11:30]  I think there were enormous political and other pressures.  And I think those people were men and women of honor that despite the pressure, despite the  politics, despite the clamoring, they were faithful to their oath.  They said, the law is the law, we arrest with probable cause.  And I think chiefly who now doesn't have a job and everybody else who doesn't have a  job now would have wanted any inkling of probable cause to say you're under arrest for whatever,  for anything, for, for criminal escalation, let's say, or, or whatever the case may be. 
[02:12:00]  Right, right.  And it just, you don't charge people with crimes in this country, hopefully.  And that'll remain the standard because people are concerned about politics or race or whatever.  You know, it's very, it's a very explosive racial issue.  And I know just from Twitter, you know, discussing the case with you on Twitter, the second you  defend your brother and defend him with facts, with facts based on, on the, the case, based  on what the police saw on the scene, based on what witnesses heard and saw, and you defend 
[02:12:30]  your brother, you are labeled a racist.  Right.  It's astounding to me.  And, and that's more offensive than somebody defending your brother based on, on facts.  Yeah.  I call it the crying wolf scenario that we have.  It's kind of twofold.  It's one that where there is real racism, we should reserve that word for when we have,  you know, a real glaring example of this is racism and we can't stand for that, you know, 
[02:13:00]  but the other side of that is that I think the standard has devolved to where, for example,  if you say, Hey Jim, I think you're a thief.  It's probably because you stole my eraser, you know, and I've seen you do that two or  three times or whatever, you know, my stapler, you're always stealing my stapler.  So you have to have some grounds for making an accusation.  I think now this racist word has become kind of a word you just throw out.  And then someone has to retroactively prove that they are not in fact a racist, you know,  make a career out of proving like I'm not a racist and throw their arms up and just go  into this whole, uh, effort of proving that they're not. 
[02:13:30]  And I don't think that's the right standard.  The criteria for being called a racist has changed so much over the years.  Now it's, I disagree with someone of color or with a different religious background,  whatever it is, you disagree.  You are now arguing your point.  Right.  Now you're a racist.  Although I will say you make the criteria from 1810 on.  No, you know what? 
[02:14:00]  And again, it's back to the press because like, I've argued this, I've talked to this,  even I didn't get into it with, with black comics at the comedy.  So just chatting about it and like, and they're, they're very passionate about it.  And, and, and then you hear what they say, like, look, this, this, this.  And it's like, these guys aren't lying.  That's what they've learned in the press.  And a lot of times you hear something like the audio that came out and you don't follow  it closely enough to hear the corrected version.  Right.  So a lot of people are going, the media does not correct themselves on the front page.  No, they're not in the business of correcting themselves. 
[02:14:30]  They do it on page eight or they do it quietly.  Oh, here's the actual audio.  They don't come out with the same vigor and correct themselves.  Well, one of the best things I've seen on the news of late with, with the various  things that have happened, the Boston bombing, when they try to just jump on the story and  get a little premature is, um, well, uh, the earlier reports had it this way, but, uh, it's  like, wait a minute.  You guys were the ones that pushed it forward.  You were the ones that said it.  You guys were the ones that pushed it forward.  Don't make it sound like it was this vague information that came into you. 
[02:15:00]  You jumped the gun and reported it this way.  Right.  And with, uh, your brother's case, it's, it's obvious they did the same thing.  Right.  They wanted this to be, uh, some type of racial injustice that was going on.  They wanted the reason that this happened was that, uh, your brother was, uh, obviously  a racist and he was just out to, uh, to, uh, hurt, uh, someone of color that night.  And, and looking at the facts, it seems especially that nothing could be further from the truth. 
[02:15:30]  I think, I think hopefully going forward from this, I mean, we're having this conversation  now.  There are things that get, like you said, the, the Boston bombing, you know, and, and,  and whatnot that get misreported and earlier reports suggest as it were, you know, but  I don't think we can afford to do that with race.  I think race and the word racist or racism need to have a very revered place, uh, in, in  light of the, of the civil rights legacy.  I think there is a point to respecting what, what those words actually mean, you know, in 
[02:16:00]  our language.  You're taking the sting out of it and the, the, the reality out of it.  If you just throw it on something that is absolutely not racist.  Right.  I, I couldn't, I couldn't agree more.  I mean, that, that, that has to be what comes from this in the end is that we have to understand  that the media acted with incompetence.  They took the word of these attorneys, you know, spinning this, uh, with who have now proven  financial motives in the outcome of this narrative.  Um, and they reported their story as fact. 
[02:16:30]  And that's, that's the definition of incompetence.  Right.  If you take the word of people who stand to make money or millions from getting people  to believe something, that's the very definition of incompetence.  So I think when you add race to that, we need to say, you know, never again after this  case.  Yeah.  When, when, when you see something like, um, uh, justice for Trayvon, uh, and then you  say something like, how about justice for, for George? 
[02:17:00]  Uh, again, you're called racist.  If you say something like that, it doesn't just saying justice for Trayvon tip the scales.  I mean, it's, it's a hard art.  I sometimes, I'm not a black man as you all can see.  So it's very hard for me to make this argument sometimes, but I think that our country has  the original sin as it were of slavery, of racism, you know?  And I think that sometimes people, uh, or, or I should say racism vis-a-vis slavery, you  know, via slavery. 
[02:17:30]  And, and I think that sometimes people are responding emotionally to very straightforward  facts.  And I think that I can't blame them for feeling the way they do.  Well, Jim, when you brought up the tapes, you know, and the editing and whatnot, if  you think that, that the news informs, if you are still that misinformed, that you actually  think that the news informs you and that is how you are informed that this is what actually  happened, I don't have any problem with that.  You know, it doesn't help us, but if that's what you really think, because that's what 
[02:18:00]  you're being, uh, told 24 hours a day, seven days a week, you know, I, I would feel  the same way if I were so misinformed, you know, I know my own brother, I know what actually  happened, so I don't feel that way.  But I think that, um, the challenge is getting people that are reacting emotionally and having  emotional, um, commitments to, to the narrative to start to think intellectually about what  actually happened and start kind of divorcing those two elements between the feeling and 
[02:18:30]  the fact and, and getting to the bottom of it.  Very hard to do with, uh, with race, with race-based cases.  I mean, you saw a very polarized, uh, support, uh, basis with, with the OJ trial.  Um, and that's really the, the last real, I mean, huge racial, uh, trial in this country.  Uh, but you, you see it here, you see it here.  I mean, there are people, it, it is so divided on racial lines as to who's supported here.  And I think, I think justice should be what is supported here. 
[02:19:00]  And, and the evidence, in fact, should dictate, uh, how you feel about, uh, the, the, when  this trial ends and there is a verdict, how you feel about that verdict should be based  on nothing but what did happen.  Right.  And, and the best, uh, of people's ability to present what really did happen and keep  that emotion, um, out of it.  That's very, very key because our system is not perfect, but I do believe it's the best  in the world. 
[02:19:30]  And it kind of is like this filter, right.  For what is allowed in and what's allowed, what's not in court, you know, so emotion doesn't  play in court.  No.  Facts do, you know, and I think.  It's what the blindfold's for.  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  And I, and I think that that will be, that's why I'm glad that so many members of the public  are attending.  They're handling that lottery really well.  I think that the public has to participate to respect the outcome.  And I think that, you know, um, uh, going forward, it should be about justice and not 
[02:20:00]  about color.  And, and we should have a reflex after a case like this to whenever somebody brings up race,  no matter what the race is, if it's white, if it's, I don't care what the race, or if  it's an invented race, like white Hispanic, you know, cause we'll have other invented races.  Right.  We should, um, we should throw up a red flag and say, not so fast.  And then never again, you know, because it's, it doesn't do us any good to come to these  foregone conclusions based on emotion about what may or may not have happened when something 
[02:20:30]  is so sensitive and so tragic.  Um, it doesn't help us.  It's a disservice to us.  And it, and it should be about fact.  And there's a day and age with, uh, of course, Twitter, social media.  Uh, has anybody been concerned that you're being very vocal in public, uh, on Twitter  about the case?  After, um, I, I announced yesterday that after the jury is selected, I was not going to tweet  anymore.  Oh, really?  No, not at all.  Now, is this, is, has this been on the recommendation of lawyers or is this just your personal? 
[02:21:00]  No, my attorney personally says that my first amendment right applies, you know, until the  rule of sequestration is invoked.  If there is a rule of sequestration, that's a very legal term.  Now that's so, if you're in court and you're seeing stuff.  You have to get out.  Right, right.  And you can't talk about it.  Sure.  And whatnot.  So until that point, I, I should feel free to take advantage of the first amendment is what  I've been told.  Now you've taken some hits with some of your, your tweets.  People have said, uh, oh my God, he's, he's ruining his brother's case.  Or, uh, he's, uh, again, he's being a racist. 
[02:21:30]  He's saying that, uh, I guess one of the most controversial ones was comparing, um, one  of the, uh, killers of, of the baby.  Right.  Um, to Trayvon in some way, shape or form.  You put two of the pictures together.  Uh, a little about that.  What, what, what happened?  I think, I think, you know, I, I think people who don't want to hear, um, or accept or believe  because they have seen images of a 12 or 13 year old child that this person could have  done what he did to George, Mr. Martin, and he could have said what he said to George and 
[02:22:00]  you're going to die tonight, mother effer, and then reach for his gun.  They don't want to believe that, you know, but what happened there is, was kind of similar  wording, you know, and, and it would have gone to that in my mind had George not defended  his life in that instant.  Um, but I think that Twitter is, is, is, is a, is a, is a wacky world.  So I'm going to leave it alone, you know, for the, for the trial and, and just let that,  uh, let the judicial system take its course.  Now you, you, I, I'm very close with my own brother. 
[02:22:30]  Uh, you know, we talk about anything, uh, a little more the personal connection between  you and your brother.  Were you close growing up?  Uh, very close, very close, very close.  So now when, are you able to speak with him just as a brother to sit down and, you know,  and say, how are you kind of, I think it's funny because I think people assume that I  have ever had a conversation with him about this case.  And I had like maybe two or three conversations way back in the beginning, but I think that's 
[02:23:00]  very telling because it came, it was his idea to be forthright and forthcoming with his  family like he was with the police, you know, and everything else.  But aside from that, um, I think when people have something to hide, they're shady, they're,  they're, they're mysterious, they, they kind of withdraw.  And, and I, I remember when I found out that my, my little sister called me actually and  she said, you know, somebody died.  And I was like, Oh my God, somebody died.  Our dad had just gotten out of the hospital. 
[02:23:30]  I thought he had died.  Oh wow.  And she said, no, it's not dad, but, uh, George will call you and he'll tell you what  happened.  And then he did, you know, so I think that, uh, despite the controversy coming out and  being so honest and open about something very tragic, um, says a lot about his character.  I don't think that people who are hiding things or criminals or, or, or have, uh, you know,  uh, mixed feelings about what they did would be so forthcoming.  And, and he, and he was, and I'm glad he told his family at the time and he told everybody 
[02:24:00]  the consistent story.  Yeah.  Wow.  Uh, so you do get to talk to him though.  Just like, how are you kind of a thing from time to time?  And this case has never come.  I mean, it's been like, it's been like 15 or 14.  He's freaking out.  Jimmy's freaking out.  What's going on?  Where's Ozzy?  He's ready to lobby waiting.  Oh, okay.  Well, I, I, I want to, no, I, Jimmy's, Jimmy's, Jimmy's, Jimmy's, Jimmy's, Jimmy's,  but I don't want to ask him to leave because what you're saying is fascinating. 
[02:24:30]  Can we, is it possible we can, we, can you go back for a bit?  Oh, I, I can hang, I have to do, um, Fox News at, Fox News at 10.  Can you, can you, can you, can we bring Ozzy and Gieser and you guys can hang out and watch  them because they only have, they only have a few minutes.  I don't want to end this because you're very interesting.  I also want to, yeah, I want to ask you a couple more questions after, uh, Ozzy and also,  uh, want to get out the information on how, you know, people could support, uh, support your  brother and, and, and the case and whatnot, uh, get that website out there.  What, what is that app actually? 
[02:25:00]  It's called, um, gzdefensefund.com.  gzdefensefund.com.  Right.  And, uh, it's very easy.  There's a link right on there.  Right.  You can, uh, use PayPal or whatever.  And just, uh, you know, this is, it's, it's a bigger issue than just George and Trayvon.  This is, uh, this is an issue of, of someone's right, uh, to defend themselves.  It's an issue of, of finding out what really happened, uh, and, and people having a fair,  uh, trial.  So, um, uh, I, I absolutely, uh, support, uh, your brother in this and, uh, yeah, hang out 
[02:25:30]  for a little while.  We'll get you on the couch when you come back.  We got Ozzy last minute.  You can watch, you can watch Jimmy fawn over Ozzy.  It's, it's fascinating.  Thank you.  Are they coming right in or are we going to take a little break?  Oh, they're coming right in?  Okay.  I just saw Opie, like, run out.  I was just getting, I was just getting this in my ear going.  Hey, uh, Ozzy has to, he's doing a lobby waiting.  I'm like, uh, uh, uh, uh, I saw, but I don't want to, because I know, I saw what looked  like a full-blown anxiety attack on the part of Jimmy, on Jimmy's face. 
[02:26:00]  Which seat do you want Ozzy to sit?  You sit here and then put, of course, of course he wants Ozzy Osbourne right next to him.  Well, we have, I, I, I don't mind using him either.  Right next to him.  He loves Ozzy.  Because their record's coming out today, uh, what?  What happened?  Oh, he's, oh, look at him.  Fucking Roland.  He's just, Roland.  Roland.  Roland.  Let's get, uh, look at Ozzy.  Ozzy Osbourne.  How you doing, Ozzy?  Take a seat, my friend.  Hello. 
[02:26:30]  Hi, guys.  What's up, man?  How you doing, man?  Take a seat.  I hope Steve lost so much weight.  Yeah, Jimmy lost a lot of weight.  Just going to the gym.  Just going to the gym and eating better.  That's it.  What did you cut out?  I just cut out eating late at night and just awful food that I was eating.  And on the road, it's hard because I eat a lot of crap on the road.  So we're on right now.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Hop the old headphones on.  Talk about the, uh, the new album.  Oh, my God.  It's doing really well around the world.  Yeah.  It's easy.  You tweeted yesterday that it was number one in, uh, in Germany, right? 
[02:27:00]  Yes.  And now today it's number one in USA, USA, UK, Greece, everywhere.  Oh, really?  So you're, you guys are obviously really.  Or iTunes.  So you're really thrilled with the fact that it's doing well.  Oh, absolutely.  Um, were you surprised by how it sounded when you, when you guys, when you finished with  it, how did you finally hear the finished product?  Well, I'd get the mixes every day.  We'd take, when we were doing it, we'd take a rough mix at home.  So that was all I was used to.  And I was kind of like, I was kind of thinking, well, it's okay, I suppose. 
[02:27:30]  But then when I heard the finished master, it blew me away.  It was so much, so good, well done.  Did you think it was going to do this well, this fast?  Oh, no, not at all.  I mean, when you're, when you're in the, in the middle of it, you don't realize how, how,  how, you know, what you're doing, you just do it naturally.  I mean, we, if it's, if it's number one now around the world, it's the first number one  we've ever had, both solo and together.  Well, the fact is too, it's also the fact that you're doing with iTunes and you did CSI 
[02:28:00]  and you're doing all of this kind of like mainstream stuff.  That's a treatment that Sabbath never got.  Well, it's kind of weird when we were together.  We never had one good review of anything.  Anybody said we were going to last.  But all of a sudden people are going, you know, they're saying positive things, which  I don't really feel comfortable with because we were always a people's band, you know.  But now it's what you've got to do because there's no records anymore and, you know, you've  got to do the, you've got to be on chat lines and what other.  This sounds like, like old Sabbath. 
[02:28:30]  This, uh, you definitely went back.  Rick Ribbon had a plan.  He was, he was, you know, it's stopping on with the, as you say, we just haven't had to  get together.  And if they do, I want to be the producer.  And so, yeah, it took us back to the first album.  And after, I'm there also, I mean, why is she going up the first album?  Well, there's like 19 albums each.  You know.  Wow.  So you've got to go back and kind of unlearn all the stuff you've learned in the 35 years. 
[02:29:00]  And it's like, lyrically, the album is brilliant.  And I know, Gieser, you're responsible for a lot of that.  Is it kind of hard to address stuff that you addressed when you were 20 or 25 and address  it now in kind of the same vein or with the same emotion?  No, because it's different.  It's, um, same, there's still some more crap going on in the world.  So, you know, there's still loads of things that you can sing about.  Well, pedophilia you address in the Catholic Church scandal, which I thought you guys addressed  really nicely and pretty aggressively. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  I mean, Ozzy came up with the line, Dear Father.  And at first it was the quote from Jesus, they know not what they do.  So I didn't want to use that since Jesus had already said it.  Yeah.  Probably if it's been quoted a few times, you don't want to rip them off.  So I thought, well, what could I do, Dear Father?  I didn't want to do it about your dad or anything.  So I just thought, well, Father, Catholic priest.  And that was all going on at the time when I was writing the lyrics. 
[02:30:00]  And so I thought, since they've been having a go at us since we started, let's have a go  back at them.  Oh, yeah.  I guess it's got to feel good after all these years of hearing them criticize what you do  and what you stand for.  Like, you know, look what was going on.  Yeah.  Because they never really listened to the lyrics anyway.  I've said they've always condemned metal, any metal thing, saying satanic and all that  crap.  And meanwhile, they're fiddling about it, little kids, you know. 
[02:30:30]  So it's our turn to show the real hypocrites and the real evil people are in the world.  And how is Tony?  I mean, I know he's, you know, he's resting up in England and getting ready to tour.  Is he doing okay?  Yeah, he's doing great.  He's responding well to his treatment.  And is the tour going to happen as scheduled?  Do you guys still think you're going to be going out and doing?  Hopefully.  It's like we contact him on a regular basis.  He sounds great when I text him on that. 
[02:31:00]  What was the schedule like when you were recording?  Because, again, he's going through chemo and treatments and he's doing an album.  So how did you balance that?  We were doing like about four or five weeks on and then he'd have his treatments and have  to rest for about a month and then go back in and do it again, which is the same thing  that we're doing for the tour.  Yeah, he'll be, we'll be touring for about six to eight weeks at a time and then he goes 
[02:31:30]  back and has his treatment.  And you're uncomfortable with the, almost the positive press and with the good reviews  and the stuff like that?  It's kind of difficult to get used to that, right?  I haven't really read any reviews yet, so.  Well, I mean, Rolling Stone is being nice about it and it's like all these outlets that  typically didn't give you guys what you deserved are now being nice.  Well, I suppose you start, you know, when they slugged us, they didn't even go to last.  Yeah, if you were around long enough, they're like, all right, we love these guys. 
[02:32:00]  It's kind of like, it's kind of like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know how to take it because it's like when the media and that start liking us,  I think, oh, well, they missed us the first time around.  But then again, I was just talking to Howard Stern and in 1968, we had no idea it was going  to last five years.  I can't imagine.  45 years.  Jesus.  It's unbelievable.  That really is.  The last studio album was 35 years ago. 
[02:32:30]  Last studio album that long ago.  Yeah, what was the, because I don't remember that, like I was, you know, I became a Sabbath  fan when I was about 12 or 13 and, you know, that was 1980 or 81.  So this is the first time I've ever experienced this and, you know, the anticipation for this  album, it was like, there's no way it could have lived up to what I wanted and I really  mean it.  It's fucking so much better than I had hoped it would be.  I can't believe how fucking much I love this record.  I mean, I hope you guys understand how great it is. 
[02:33:00]  You're just looking at each other.  You're gushing, Jimmy.  I'm just being a gushing, sissy fanboy.  Who are you going to blow first?  Well, geezer just volunteered Ozzy, so I guess Ozzy.  Well, what was the question?  I really wasn't.  I was just saying, I kind of hope you guys...  Oh, there was no question there.  No question.  That was a rhetorical ass-kissing you just got.  I was just basically saying...  That was a good ass-lapping.  Do you know how good the record is?  Because when you're close to something...  Well, when you're doing it, you don't realize, you know, you like it, you love it, but then 
[02:33:30]  we're not used to having all this attention, you know.  We used to put albums that would go on the road, you know.  Well, the CSI thing was interesting, too, because that's such a mainstream show, and it's very  rare that I ever got to see my band on a show like that.  You know, because I loved you guys, and I loved Kiss, and there was never that mainstream  treatment in the 70s.  But there's no outlet anymore.  There's no music television.  There's no MTV, just the fucking channels with games and things.  There's no... 
[02:34:00]  Unless you watch that metal show on VH1, which is like 4 o'clock in the morning or something.  So do you think that...  So records aren't making what they used to make.  I mean, obviously, the money mostly comes from touring as opposed to the albums.  I don't really ask my wife that question.  I don't know.  Because they're saying, like, a lot of bands complain that they can't make money doing the  albums anymore.  Well, it's like...  They're downloaded for free, and pretty soon it's going to be...  You can't make...  Anything is going to cost you money to make records. 
[02:34:30]  Has the technology and stuff in iTunes and the availability and grabbing one song here  and one song there helped you guys or hurt you guys, do you think?  Do you think it's exposed you to more people, or does it hurt you?  I think it's instant now.  It's like I was saying last night, you can look up iTunes now, and I was just looking  to see what new stuff is coming out this week, and I noticed that the Sabbath album is number  one, so it's like, oh God, you know, you forget that it's that instant.  So I understand that the people want it, want something, but they want it now, and everything's 
[02:35:00]  instant now, so that it's like, instead of having to go down to your record shop, which  is gone.  But there's something sad about that, because when you used to do vinyl albums, you'd have  a great artwork on the albums.  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's something to read, and you're kind of excited for anything to release that.  Something to clean your weed on.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Missiles.  Yeah.  Astros.  You can wing it across the room. 
[02:35:30]  There's a little bit of everything with those album covers.  You're on your pizza box.  Yeah.  Something to shoot at.  Right.  But that is, you do miss that.  It's like the smell of a new record, and the big booklets that would come with them, and  all that stuff now is just like a little digital picture, and it's not quite the same.  And the vinyl things become a collector's only kind of a thing.  Yeah.  Also, journeying outside the house.  You have to go to the store.  Oh, yeah.  You can stay in your house and have everything delivered.  You don't have to leave ever.  It's amazing.  I like that idea a bit, you know. 
[02:36:00]  I kind of like that part myself, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't go out much.  Go on the couch with the fucking Netflix on them.  Netflix on them.  Yeah, yeah.  You just pop everything really instantly available right there to your house.  Do you not think we're all moving too far?  It is a little bit.  There are times where you should probably go out, maybe meet people face to face.  Get some air.  Yeah, get a little air.  I don't know.  It just seems like now, we were talking about Facebook and Twitter and how you meet people, 
[02:36:30]  and especially relationships with girls and things like that when you want to go out.  You used to have to look a girl in the face and ask her, you know, hey, you want to go out or you want to do that.  Now, you wind up seeing each other's fucking pussy and tits and dick and everything else.  Before you go out.  Give me that.  Before you go out.  I want to have a look at that one.  Pussy and tits and dick.  That's one girl.  That hand.  That hand's been with more chicks.  Jesus.  It's just that, the whole, the dance has been just compressed into this tiny... 
[02:37:00]  So you can lie also, you can also lie on this movie.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm 21 and she's fucking 85 years old.  People do that too.  They send out photos that aren't them.  Yeah, yeah.  I know, because I do it.  Yes, of course you do, Jim.  I receive them!  I don't know.  It's just, I don't think it's better or worse in any way. 
[02:37:30]  I just think it's different.  You know, history will...  It fucking is if I didn't wake up next to an 85 before.  History will always, you know, things will change over time.  I mean, this is just something else.  Yeah.  My fingers are so sticky.  Who are you talking to there?  Sticky fingers.  It's weird.  I've gone through entire relationships on the phone, like just text messaging and pictures 
[02:38:00]  and then you never wind up meeting the person.  It's really weird how you get, you don't have to go out and talk to people.  There's a beginning, a middle and an end of this pseudo relationship and you never meet.  It's, it's the oddest thing.  And then after a while you realize, oh, I haven't even fucking like messaged them in, in weeks.  Oh, I guess that's over.  It's like, what was it?  What over?  It was never was.  It's an odd thing.  It really is.  It's the oddest thing on the TV when they set people up and they go, they got a sex thing. 
[02:38:30]  And a guy goes, you know who I am.  Oh, would they, would they, would they have you go to the house and he shows up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have I seen it?  I've been on it.  It's pretty weird.  You know?  Yeah.  There was one guy when he took all his clothes off and the guy goes, he's sitting there naked.  He goes, well, what do you do?  He says, I'm a rabbi.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was, uh, uh, To Catch a Predator.  To Catch a Predator.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Craziest show ever.  Yeah.  Actually, uh, there was a guy there and he said to, um, what was his name? 
[02:39:00]  Chris Hanson.  Chris Hanson.  He goes, oh yeah, I saw you on the Opie and Anthony show.  I was like, oh great, there's one of ours.  They got one of our fans.  One of our fans getting cuffed out on the lawn, crying, trying not to look into the camera.  That was a highlight for us, huh?  It certainly was.  Hey, better him than me.  Do you get concerned with privacy and stuff like that?  Because now everything is saveable, like with digital technology, every text you save,  every message, it's, it's all saveable.  Every movie you make.  And it's like, you know, I don't know how I feel about that, whether it's good or bad, 
[02:39:30]  but I mean.  Well, regardless how you feel, it's happening.  Just have the NSA.  It absolutely is.  If the government's been watching me.  I must be honest, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't know how to work a computer very well.  Yeah.  Two things about it.  You're not, uh.  But I can't remember that.  My son sits there and says, if you want to get this, press this button.  I'm still pressing fucking buttons and nothing happens.  Trying to find something.  I'm impressed with what the screen fucking wipes out.  You must, you must be a wizard.  I'll get that curly thing.  That's it.  That's it. 
[02:40:00]  The thing that says it's doing something, it's doing something.  It's working!  It's working?  I've had it 15 years and he's fucking working!  Hey, how's Jack doing?  He's doing great.  He's doing great.  He's doing absolutely great.  We love him, man.  He's a good guy.  He's only done our show once, but he's a solid human being.  He's very cool.  It's something we, like, grew up, we watched your kids grow up on television.  Wow.  Jack's just giving us her daughter, Pearl.  Crazy.  It seemed like yesterday it was in a field in my house.  He was a little kid on the show. 
[02:40:30]  It's fun now, yeah.  Are you a good grandfather?  You a good grandfather, Oz?  I love her, she's wonderful.  I've got grandchildren from other kids.  Oh, that's true.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ninety-three.  I was a little off on that one.  Yeah, just a little, just a couple of years.  I was off a couple of decades.  No, I do not.  I've been a busy boy!  Yeah, you certainly have.  I guess the new one, I should have said.  You know, I was just sharing the other day, I was just sharing them.  Would you like to be able to have another kid?  She goes, no fucking way.  You're done. 
[02:41:00]  No more.  Oh, we're done, we're done a long time ago.  Yeah, yeah, I don't doubt it.  Do you ever, excuse me, you're more private.  Like, you see Ozzy's life has been so public for all these years.  Did that kind of make you want to be more public?  No, no, no, no.  Wow, that was definitive.  I'm not the least public person on earth.  I don't use the phone, don't use anything.  Oh, really?  I go home and that's it.  You never see me.  That's it, huh?  You're not online or anything, geezer?  I'm online, but only about three people know the dress. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, so you're not a big guy, you know, you don't enjoy like the Twitter or the texting  or anything, you kind of just keep it to them.  No, I have people to do that.  Yeah.  I sent you an email, actually.  I thought it was you.  Yeah, but Hasselhoff.  No.  Joey's like, no, that's not me.  No, we all, because we all took, last time I saw you guys, like two weeks ago, we all  took a picture and you said to your assistant, you never send me the pictures to your assistant.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She sent it to me. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, thank God.  Okay.  Because I should have just lied to you.  You sent it to me, you sweat.  That sounds like an instant delete.  Fucking Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Who is this creep between, I wanted a picture of me and Ozzy, not this fucking troll.  I've just been ruining the photo.  Yeah.  Do you guys watch that metal show?  Do you watch that?  Fuck.  No, no reason to go to sleep.  I watch it.  Oh, shit.  There goes Eddie Trunk.  There goes Eddie Trunk.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:42:30]  Florentine.  Florentine.  All right.  So, what happens?  I'm seeing you guys tonight at the town hall.  We're doing that thing down in-  Oh, yeah.  And we're talking to a large audience.  And we're going to have Tony will be on remote and Brad Wilkes and Jack.  And Brad was a great choice for drums.  And I know you guys had to pick somebody.  You can't have an album without a drummer.  And what was the final point that said, this is the guy for us, as opposed to other guys 
[02:43:00]  that you've been working with?  That we had two weeks to go in the studio and record.  And then we didn't have anybody.  So, Rick, it was Rick's idea to bring in Brad.  We tried a few other drummers and they didn't work out.  And Rick just said, try Brad.  It's going to work out.  And we tried him.  We did about two weeks rehearsals with him.  And after about a week, everything fell into place.  And we went, yeah, this is the right choice.  Was there a time where you thought he might not be the guy? 
[02:43:30]  Like, was there a time where it was-  The first few days, it was like really strange.  Especially after being with Bill for hundreds of years.  Right.  And it was just weird playing with a different drummer that you've never played with before.  And then, but-  Originally it was going to be Tommy, but Rick didn't want to use Tommy.  Rick Rubin gave him a few pointers and Brad sort of got it and we got into the groove of everything that we were doing.  And it went from there.  It turned out really well. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, it seems like to go back and I was amazed you were able to grab.  Like anyone who's an old Sabbath fan will love this because I was amazed you were able to get that sound.  Like legitimately get the sound of like the first couple of albums.  Rick Rubin was hell bent.  I didn't know what he was talking about for a long time.  Probably likewise, aren't he?  From the first album.  Yeah.  We kept doing it.  May I just listen to the first album and it was like, what the fuck is he on about? 
[02:44:30]  And then it kind of clicked because we were originally, we were a jazz blues band.  And we'd be doing the songs on the first album live, so it was like a bit of an overflow from the blues.  The feel he was looking for.  To be able to listen to old tracks like that and know what needs to be put on the guitar,  what needs to be put on the bass and whatnot to get that old sound is really, that's a talent, man.  Rick Rubin for years.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:45:00]  Every time I'd run into him, he would say, if you do a Sabbath album, count me in.  So he didn't come straight in fresh.  He'd been working in his mind.  Right, right.  So he knew.  You know, it was very interesting.  It sounds like old Sabbath, but it doesn't sound dated at all.  That's a talent to be able to do something like that.  It basically got us back to playing live in the studio instead of putting tons of overdubs and keyboards and effects and everything else on. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  That we got into this habit in the late 70s of just layering everything, just going over the top in the studio.  Yeah.  Producing ourselves.  And the more dope we were doing, the more.  The more tracks.  Were you guys doing drugs in the 70s?  No.  No.  Everything.  No.  No.  No.  We're going to church.  Oh, geez.  We're doing Tylenol.  Yeah, that's about it. 
[02:46:00]  Andrew was good there, man.  Well, there's a documentary that's being shown tonight, a 25-minute documentary, and you said something interesting about back in those, like, you know, a lot of times you have to sing the chorus more than once.  And back in those days, or for a while, you'd sing it once, and then they would just, the computer would bounce it off something.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And now you wanted to sing these.  Yeah, yeah.  I sang it exactly the way I used to do in the old days.  Which was kind of just to blow it right through.  Just go through it, you know.  And did you like this more, having done it, this process, or did you kind of go like, wow, we missed the computers, or fuck, we've been missing out? 
[02:46:30]  No, no, no.  We never had our first album.  It was two four-trick machines bouncing under each other, if you don't know what I'm talking about.  And once you bounced it down, you couldn't take it back, so you kind of mixed as you're going along, you know.  And it was just, we just, because we went in, plugged in, played, and that's the way we thought people would make records.  Why did bands stop doing that? Because every time there's a classic record, you always hear, like, these amazing albums.  Oh, we did that in four hours. Like, all these great works that were done.  And then, for some reason, people fell into the computer trap and overproduced. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  A lot of it's having your home computers, because you can do anything on your laptops.  As many tracks as you need.  Yeah.  And then they go into the studio, and that's the thing, that's the way you're supposed to do it.  You had to play it live accurately in the studio, because you only had a limited number of tracks on the tape.  And once you bounced it down, though, now, if you bounced down your bass and guitar track onto a single track,  now you can't alter the difference between the bass and the guitar. 
[02:47:30]  So you have to keep building and building and building.  So you've got to play pretty accurately together, as opposed to if you got a zillion tracks,  now you just bam, bam, bam, mixed it later. Fix it in the mix, motherfucker.  Exactly.  We'll fix it in the mix.  But then that process got meticulous.  Yeah, then it got overproduced.  Right.  And then they would take a year to fucking mix an album.  Yep.  But this time, we got back to playing it live in the studio, and if one of us made a big mistake, 
[02:48:00]  we'd have to stop and start from the top again.  Start over again.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So we all had to really concentrate, and we sort of knew the songs backwards by then.  A little more pressure.  And are you vocally doubling yourself, like you're singing on top of yourself again,  instead of just taking one track and doubling?  I'm still doing the whole thing.  You're singing.  I like that because it gives these slight differences in the voice and makes it almost  like oscillate a little between the notes. 
[02:48:30]  You've been in a recording studio.  Yeah, a couple of times.  Yeah, yeah.  A few times.  He was in a band.  But it's such a fuller sound when you do it like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's like the classic Ozzy sound, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sometimes a flaw is okay.  There's one part in Damaged Soul, which I know I'm kind of going deep for anyone who  hasn't heard the album, but it's such a fucking heavy song.  And there's one point where you say soul and your voice cracks a little bit and they 
[02:49:00]  left that imperfection.  Yeah, yeah.  I like that.  I've always liked the fact that you can hear people's fingers going up the fretboard.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It makes it sound like a...  Now it's like fucking pure sound.  Yeah.  And it's not supposed to sound like that.  It doesn't sound like that.  Yeah, yeah.  I've been in the studio doing an album.  And I sang it one, not on this last album, but one of my albums.  And I got this track home to my house.  I'm playing it and I go, I never fucking sang it like that.  And I found the producer and I said, Michael, can I ask you a question? 
[02:49:30]  Is it possible to tune the voice differently?  He goes, oh, yeah.  Oh, did you do that?  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  I said, you fucking asshole.  I mean, that can make it sound different, you know?  Yeah, that's not me.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  So it irritated you?  If I don't want to sing it that way, I don't want to sing it that way.  It just altered the melody.  Yeah, they could alter the pitch and then they gate out any ambient sound that was in there. 
[02:50:00]  This is the beginning of a Pro Tool.  I don't really know what Pro Tool is.  Pro Tools.  Fucking around with it in a Pro Tool.  Yeah, yeah.  So did you at one point get caught up in that?  Like just recording in different students?  Not with each other, but I mean, as the years went on, did you kind of fall into that?  I've never really got into that kind of thing.  It's not the way we started.  But a lot of producers do.  You know, I think that's the way you do it.  That's why Rick was so good, because he took us back as if it was an analogue recording.  Right, yeah.  And the days of the drugs and all that stuff. 
[02:50:30]  Tony said in an interview recently, I think with BBC, that you would have them flown in on a private plane.  Yeah.  Wow.  I didn't get any.  I was the one that picked you up.  I went down Monday to get a coach on the plane.  He couldn't get back to Friday.  That's probably a bad idea.  Send Ozzy for the drugs.  He'll bring him back.  I'm still fucking out there now.  I'm trying to do the fucking white lines on the runway.  Oh shit.  Yeah. 
[02:51:00]  Send the dog out for the sticks.  White lines on the runway.  Yeah.  Is it harder to come up with the, like you said, like the lyrics and stuff.  You're not talking about a lot of this, like the drugs and all that stuff that you would write about at one point.  I mean, that's obviously.  Hey.  Methademic Ozzy wrote.  Oh, is that you?  Yeah.  What happened?  You were just watching something out of meth and you're like.  I was doing meth.  Yeah.  It's called a mirror.  He was watching something.  It was just two big lines on a mirror.  Oh shit.  Perfect answer. 
[02:51:30]  That was.  Yeah, I guess so.  Why would I have think that Ozzy didn't do meth?  What the fuck's wrong with me?  It's Ozzy Osbourne when you're talking to me.  I agree.  That was a dumb question.  I asked this.  Good thing I got it out of the way now.  Not that I.  He's so sweet.  You're a sweet boy.  I really am.  He just likes thinking the best.  He is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who did meth in your life?  What the fuck's wrong with me?  It was him.  It was him.  Just say no to drugs, Ozzy.  Right, Jimmy.  We get it.  Well, I don't.  I never did meth.  I never did it.  I quit years ago and I never got to do it. 
[02:52:00]  I hear it's quite a fun one for a little while.  Oh, yeah.  It's good for insomnia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fun.  What does it do to you?  I'll tell you about.  I was watching that thing.  Someone suggested I watch that.  Breaking Bad.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking great.  Isn't that a great show?  Every time he comes, I'm watching some other show about drugs and people getting fucked  up.  Jack says to me, Dad, why is he watching programs about drugs?  That's all I watch. 
[02:52:30]  You just watch drug shows?  That's all I watch.  Shows about smuggling and all this shit.  Breaking Bad's a good one.  That is a good one.  Right.  I'm looking forward to the next series, actually.  Were you more into being drug-induced up or a little down on stage?  Any fucking thing.  Anything?  Like when you were performing, though?  Did you have any preference?  Heroin, coke, fucking everything.  Really?  So you didn't even care?  You didn't even care.  Up or down.  Up or down.  Up or down.  Up or down. 
[02:53:00]  Up or down.  I didn't even begin with a B.  Did you ever leave the stage after a show and then maybe wake up the next day and have  no recollection of doing a show?  Really?  That was my fucking habit, that was.  It wasn't a show.  It was a decade.  How did the show go?  Fuck the show.  It was a whole decade.  I fucking did.  I mean, when I discovered Second All.  That was another one.  Really?  Second All?  I didn't fucking place down in the bathroom.  What does Second All do?  I never did that either.  It's Bobbitcher. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Breads.  Wow.  And it takes you down.  Oh, fucking.  I don't like that.  That's what I would tell you about.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think that's what I have over, over too many of them on the fucking Titanic.  You go down big time on that.  Is that good after a night of coke binging and stuff to kind of come down?  You could say that.  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah.  Dr. Ozzy prescribes that you should take some barbs when you.  I'm always amazed with guys that figured out the combinations. 
[02:54:00]  I was just a very basic, you know, basic guy.  Let's get some dummy like me.  Try these.  See if you come around.  Did anyone in the band get pissed at you like fuck Ozzy come on which I got fired  Nine o'clock in the morning  Very productive no, I didn't think it would be yeah, did it interfere with the recording schedule and stuff when you were back in those days 
[02:54:30]  I  Well rock star Ozzy, I I really love it  And again everybody knows I'm gonna love it on the Sabbath freak, but it's like I it's so nice to say it and mean it  I love this album so much. It's nice to be a fan and then have a product come out. You're just like wow  I'm not disappointed. It's really heavy  I mean the album is really fucking heavy and it's it's like it's something I would have expected in 1971  So if that was the goal you you hit them. Yeah, thank you 
[02:55:00]  All right, and my friend Jim Florentine said it's a masterpiece. It's out today  He put he puts on that sleeping a show there that metal show when you got to go to sleep you put it on  Ozzy that should be the problem  He says yeah, that's our yeah, we know the hosts and I know you guys have music channels to do something  I'm gonna keep you all day because I know there's other press you and I'm seeing you tonight  I don't want you to think I'm interview stalking you. This was like a  He is see me tonight go like what we just talked to you, but it's for a different thing and I'm not 
[02:55:30]  Trying to fucking bother you. All right, of course, you're not  Ozzy Giza. Thanks so much for coming in man. Take a quick break and perfect  The O.B. and Anthony show I like what you do on Sirius XM  The O.B. and Anthony show  The O.B. and Anthony  The O.B. and Anthony  Continues  Ozzy was great 
[02:56:00]  Giza was great. I like Giza as well and Jimmy  Did a great job there sir. So thank you. Somebody told me I I and I apologize to Robert. I was just panicking  I I I I uh  Yeah, pop back up Bob  I wish I got a picture of the look on your uh your face the anxiety  You were in you were in you were in complete panic mode  Well, Ozzy because we got it in our in our headphones from Iraq saying all 
[02:56:30]  Ozzy's in the lobby waiting and I was worried that we're gonna leave because they have music channel interviews  So I said can they do the music channels first because we had Robert right and then come over after for a few minutes  And I goes no they can't like the music channels aren't ready  So like literally if Ozzy and Giza didn't come in here. They probably would have left now. Yeah  Yeah, we obviously we have Robert Zimmerman George Zimmerman's brother. He's uh  George is on trial is down in florida. They're doing jury selection and stuff and uh  Robert's come up  Uh to do our show. It's fantastic. Thanks so much 
[02:57:00]  I want to ask one  Yeah, the fans really are like get on that show  I want to ask one uh one question. What kind of threats are you and your family getting?  I've heard I've heard uh rumors where you know you you show up to do an interview like uh like our show and uh  They come out of the woodwork. They have and I think sometimes what kind of stuff have they been saying or attempting to do?  Well the day before yesterday the day before jury selection they were tweeting out our parents address again like roseanne retweeted and right  Yes, slightly had tweeted right and so um, it it's something we take seriously 
[02:57:30]  It's it's not something you can afford to be  Mistaken about because you could be dead wrong, right if you don't take them seriously, but  um, it's something also that worries me about  Um, or I should say adds to my concern about the the jury, you know, I don't think anybody understands  what it's like to be associated with George  Yeah, his family, you know, and I'm worried about that  Uh going forward that that these jurors will be under some kind of pressure right in florida 
[02:58:00]  There's something called lesser included  Uh verdicts  So if you are charged with murder too, you could be convicted of  Manslaughter or negligent manslaughter  Um, and sometimes juries feel pressure to do something something anything  Yes, yes, right, right  Yeah, yeah, I'm worried about that because it's something that we do live with so if he if he's charged with murder too, I guess that  They literally the prosecution can just charge that and not have the risk of not getting it because he's less a charge that they could just convict  I think it's a tactic I think it's a tactic prosecutors use all the time, you know, they overcharge and they think that in in high pressure cases like this that the jury will feel compelled to do something, you know, to to appear 
[02:58:30]  If the original charge is so big, my god, it's got to be something so we have to  Yeah, yeah  Also odd about florida, the six-person jury  Very odd  This is really odd  I mean, obviously we're used to a 12-person jury  What's that all about and how do you feel is that advantageous to the defense or the prosecution? 
[02:59:00]  Um, the number's half so I mean it's hard to really judge if it affects it either way  I'm glad that there's only six people who are going to have their lives disrupted by this, you know as opposed to twice that number  But I think 12 um applies when there's uh when it's a death penalty case, you know  It's six and a lot of people say are you sure you know what you're saying and I'm like, yeah, I'm sure, you know  Just really six people and it should be 12 and you know, but I've been hearing that for a long time for the better part of the year 
[02:59:30]  I would think you might get a more I don't know if intimate's the word but a little more um  They're they're in that jury room. They're discussing things. It's a lot closer group  I think than 12 and it would probably be easier for people to convince other people  Right, especially if it's a limited amount like one or two people that aren't  Um in in line with the rest of the jury  It's it's bizarre, but you know the population of florida is very old. Yeah, yeah, yeah getting 12 very old people 
[03:00:00]  and obviously the the racial makeup is uh  the racial makeup is is  Important whether it should be or not  But it is in this case a lot of people are making a lot  Uh much ado about the racial right that if there are not enough, you know of this race or that race or whatever  And as you said whether it should be or not who knows, you know  But it is important because our system relies on people respecting the outcome based on participation 
[03:00:30]  You know not just the public attending but the jury being sure reflective of the public of the community, right?  And what what is the percentage, uh of uh the black, uh percentage in in the uh county?  I think when you talk about seminal county generally, we're only talking about somewhere between 10 and 20 percent  So don't uh, you know, don't quote me on that. It could be 14 or 11, you know, or something like that  I think in sanford, uh the number might be higher, but  Seminole county as as a whole is not, uh 
[03:01:00]  Very populated with african immigrants. Have you have you it has has basically  I'm sorry. I know that there's plenty of like you said like roseanne retweeted something and has it been a long racial lines the way people have lined up or no?  Um, have you have you have you noticed any black people favoring uh george?  I think that the um african americans who have shown their support have done uh a  Have have taken an approach of kind of throwing out the old book that al sharply and jesse jackson  You know, like if this person is african-american, they must be right. Therefore the other one is wrong 
[03:01:30]  And they and they're they're nauseated to be quite honest with the whole  Race aspect of everything. It's it's not just hypersensitive, but it's it's become this  Like I was talking about before this kind of retroactive  Proving that you have to do that. You're not racist when someone just right you are, you know  And there's kind of sick of that, you know, and yeah  The black people that have shown their support  Um always bring that up, you know, like we don't accomplish anything by just saying racist 
[03:02:00]  That's easy. Yeah, you know, we don't we don't fix anything. We don't get to truth  We don't discuss fact. We we have no dialogue that's meaningful. We just insult somebody  Yeah, yeah, it doesn't really help, uh with with anything, right?  Uh, so  As far as the trial schedule and I know it's pretty open-ended. Um, what are they talking six weeks about?  Estimated the estimates now or that jury selection might take two weeks or thereabouts 
[03:02:30]  Now the fry hearing was supposed to take a day. Yeah, yeah, and that or part of a day and it's ended up being this, you know  Multi-day. Yeah, yeah  So these these cases there's a lot at risk here and there's a lot of presentation to be done by the defense and and and the and the state  Um, so things tend to expand, you know and go on for more than one would expect when you watch the  uh, I was watching the uh sound experts and uh for the defense and the prosecution and to see such stark differences 
[03:03:00]  Right between their opinions  Uh, professional opinions on the same thing, right? Uh  Is that disheartening when you know when you see that it's encouraging it's encouraging encouraging to me?  I hope that you know  I hope that that that the court rules that those experts are not allowed  But if they are allowed, you know  Too bad for the state those people come across and i've heard from many and they come across as hobbyists  At best, you know, the state the state witnesses and if that's  If that's what the state had to stoop to to bring charges is these quacks. Yeah, you know with with their with their voodoo 
[03:03:30]  Science if as it were  Um, then you know, they're gonna have to put that before a jury and I think it's gonna look  Very bad and the the the old good for the goose good for the gander thing  If if you have the defense and the prosecution presenting experts on the same piece of evidence  And it's directly contradictory contradictory to each one  Right  It that right there is is reasonable doubt. I mean it it kind of cancels 
[03:04:00]  Right out the evidence, right?  Well, what the fry hearing does is it determines uh, what's called uh, the the admissibility based on methodology  You know, is the method used to to determine whether this is expert opinion or not or to an  Analyze uh a piece of evidence  Is it is is the methodology behind it sound science, you know, and I think what's  Resonating here and what's emerging is that you cannot analyze screams you can analyze voice right right when you have a scream 
[03:04:30]  And you have a scream over telephone and there's all these  Variables from a phone inside a home that the speaker could have been  Or the microphone could have been pointing any which way or it could have been on the face or not on the face  No, yeah, because that scream is being heard from somebody that was on the phone with 9-1-1  Right, so the the scream is coming into the house in some way shape or form through a window a door whatever it is  Into the phone onto the 9-1-1 tapes right now that how  In any way shape or form can anybody think that you can decipher who that is? 
[03:05:00]  Well certainly the fbi can't or have not been able to you know  Certainly the the state of florida has not been able to but there seems to be an expert for the state yeah  Yeah, yeah a lot of money  Um who's making what one uh defense expert called imaginary accusations about what he hears so I gotta be honest with you  I I honestly think that if this case wasn't so racially charged and uh so much hadn't been brought out in the in the media and  And uh people using it for their own devices. Uh, um, I I think this would have never 
[03:05:30]  Come to a trial  Um, and and if if it did I I I think it would be a slam dunk acquittal right?  Yeah, I I think the media likes to pat themselves on the back  And they they are under the impression that but for their action, you know  But for them look at what we did look at. Yeah, we brought justice, you know  And it would not have been uh, this way if we did not get involved and what actually happened was the law stopped working 
[03:06:00]  45 days later when right was arrested  Self-defense statute exists so that when people are forced to defend themselves  Their lives are not screwed for lack of a better word, right?  Yeah, because they defended themselves and that's the way it should be  You know, if you defend your life and you're justified in doing so there should be some kind of standard  Uh that says  We can prove that's not true and they're therefore you're arrested  You shouldn't have to yeah  You shouldn't have to go broke  Uh, you shouldn't have to sacrifice everything you have in your life just to prove that you were right in the first place, right? 
[03:06:30]  Uh, I I was saying before during the break that this it's a very important trial  Uh, I I I think when you have racially  Charged uh  Trials like this, it's very important that it's done right every trial is important that it's done, right  Right, but when something is so out there and in the public eye  It can be very discouraging if things go wrong people lose faith in the system  Uh, it makes people very cynical, so I think this really has to play out based on 
[03:07:00]  evidence  and true justice  uh  Regardless of of what people's emotions are and on either side I think it's very important  I think it was playing out that way in the early days, right?  Yeah, the people who are investigating it despite what the NAACP would have said at the time that there was no investigation  Whatsoever, you know, that's obviously false, but  Um, I think those people were giving that message fairly consistently  Yeah  There is no probable cause and that in this country we charge when there's probable cause and george had not committed 
[03:07:30]  Murder or any crime, you know, and so  Um, I I think that the people of sanford deserve to hear that message  Repeated by the special prosecutor instead of hearing  We're gonna charge with murder because all of these people here are incompetent. They were not incompetent. They were honoring their oath. Yeah, yeah  It's really  It's really it's such a  A hard  You know, it's like I I see like a half  Why did my question about george was why did he 
[03:08:00]  Not the fact that I wanted one operator saying go back like I know that's all nonsense  But but but if he got out with the gun  And he had the pistol how did trayvon get on him?  That's always been a point. I heard I heard yeah  Your spot of saying like yeah, you have a gun. How could you lose control of a situation? I was I was I was telling uh,  Anthony before that  I think that if you don't carry a gun  You have a different  Expectation about what that means and I think that in this in this country 
[03:08:30]  We have really 50 sets of laws that govern  The expectations that we have of you know, what what what does it mean to carry a gun based on where you live  Where you are with town city state? I mean  There are so many different laws whenever they say well  We need to do something about gun laws, right?  It's like you can't  They vary so much from state to state and city to city, right?  You can't just cover it with one thing yeah, yeah, definitely and you don't just you can get  Assaulted and have a gun if you don't feel your life is being threatened 
[03:09:00]  Um, you don't use your gun it's isn't it is in fact illegal right the lonious in some situations to  Brandishing you're not allowed to do it  Uh, I I think people that carry guns uh for the most part  And they should be are the most educated people about guns  Um, when whenever I get into a second amendment argument with somebody that doesn't know anything about guns  It's I wonder why they're even arguing I would never attempt to start talking about race cars 
[03:09:30]  With a race car driver and and profess to know more than they do about it  And I think that's the same thing with the second amendment issue  But again emotion gets in right people feel compelled to repeat stuff  No matter how inaccurate that they've heard people are under the assumption that no matter where you are  You can walk into a gun store and without any kind of check buy a fully automatic machine gun  And just go out along your merry way and they will argue that point to you regardless of how educated you are on on the fact  So I think when when you hear things like well 
[03:10:00]  He gets out he has a gun this guy's unarmed  Uh, how did this happen?  Obviously, he's in the wrong because he had the gun he didn't  Right  No, it doesn't work that way and as as somebody who carries a gun you realize what the responsibilities are  um  How far you can  advance the confrontation based on what's coming back at you  Right, I think the word that comes to mind is escalation  Escalation  You know an escalation of force  Escalation of force  Violence and and what when you finally have to make the deadly physical force 
[03:10:30]  Yes, right  That's when the gun becomes exposed or relevant and never before that and it wasn't  As we we hear in in testimony and whatnot  What the police were told and and what evidence shows based on how close he was when he was shot  It seemed to be there was an altercation  The gun was not brought out until  The one shot was fired that when when george felt his life was being  uh in imminent danger, so 
[03:11:00]  If he got out and started waving the gun around or you know  I mean, that's just absurd somebody who calls the police that much is not it's not going to be  Yeah, why would you call the police if you're out just looking for gun trouble?  It right  None of it really adds up and I think a  A sensible  Jury will will eventually see that and uh  You know, I I hope for the best for uh your brother and uh and your family  Uh again, what what website can people go to if they want to uh kick in a little support?  It's um, the only website to go to yeah 
[03:11:30]  GZ defense fund dot com  That's the only website and there's other fake sites that are like for yeah, yeah  Yeah, not this or dot that but gz defense fund dot com  Is the only one uh that links directly to the trust for for his defense  Yeah, so what do you got going on the next couple of days looking like for you fox?  CNN yeah back to florida and we'll see from there i'm definitely concluding  I mean, I I think this will be the last time i'm on the radio until george's acquittal  Because I think that I need to uh 
[03:12:00]  Insulate him from any kind of harm that could come his way or anything I could say that's  Inflammatory prejudicial controversial or what have you  Um, i'd like to remain vocal about people who are railroaded  Especially as it relates to the second amendment or race after his case and there'll be a time for that  But now our objective is seeing him acquitted  So I have to be very very careful  Just dm me the stuff. I'll put it right out. Okay. I'll put it out my own name. It'll be great 
[03:12:30]  Work it's a team. We got to get him out. Uh, yeah, yeah, you got fox coming up. Uh, yes going over there great  uh, and and your lawyer buddy, uh  Yeah, um, it's uh, see um, chris at cjplaw.com chris at cjplaw right dot com  Um, he found a show.

[03:14:00]  Pushed it to the end  Listen, after tonight, you're gonna get a lot of directing jobs. You know that.  Oh, I hope so, yes. Uh, kirk fox, we became instant friends out there in la, sir.  Listen, it was inevitable  It was, right?  I've been stalking you long enough and uh, I made sure you were on that show so that uh,  Eventually, I could be on your radio show.  Kirk, I haven't seen anything. Have you been on more than one episode or is this the only episode?  All of them just about  Oh, you are on all of them, okay  Have you been in?  I do every prank, jimmy 
[03:14:30]  Oh, okay  He uh, I don't know how, uh, how you did it. I mean, you're on every week playing a different uh, person and uh, hitting it out of the ballpark  Uh, most of the time  Listen, I'm just lucky that uh, I came out of there alive  I had to play cops, I had to play a lot of things  Everything was always real except the bulletproof vest and the gun  Right  And I think our prank is the best of the season  I'm gonna say it now, I've been downplaying it this entire time 
[03:15:00]  We filmed that in what, November, December, but  Listen, Opie, the word on the street is that it might be the best prank ever uh,  Even committed on anyone on earth  I say it's the best prank of the season, right there  I, I, I hear it's between me and Tom Green as the best prank of the year  Listen, this isn't about Tom today  Tom's not on the phone with us  So we don't even need to bring him up, but he was definitely in the running, but has no competition  Yeah, we take on like conspiracy uh, shit tonight 
[03:15:30]  And Kurt Fox fucking, fucking nailed it  It was right, it was right in our wheelhouse  We scared some people  We changed the world  The, the funny thing is we had a film uh, I don't know, in a very scary part of L.A.  And uh, the first mark comes in and we nailed it  And then the fucking director, the real director goes home and says, ah, you don't need me anymore  So then we're just playing around  Yeah  With no supervision  He felt that he had seen enough  He, he said, I've seen enough, I got other things to do, because that's like the L.A. thing to do 
[03:16:00]  Well, he also has a wife and children that must have demanded his attention  Oh, I see  And then it turns out that the one he saw was like the weakest of the night  We ended up getting even better marks  Listen, it was, it was a good time  Hey, uh, Kirk, I, I know a little bit about you now  I, I know that you drive a very old car  Uh, you know, old, but it was new once  And I think that's important  Tell these guys how many miles  On that car?  Yeah 
[03:16:30]  Listen, there might, there's clearly over a hundred thousand  It doesn't matter how many miles are on my 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid, but I still have it  Yeah, but you're becoming a star out there in Hollywood  And I think you need to upgrade your car  Listen, I will, I will, I'm gonna get something new  I'm looking at things a little faster, but this, this car has a few more miles on it  It's like a, it's like my favorite t-shirt  Kirk Fox is a strange dude, I'm telling you  That's why we hit it off, huh?  Kirk was in the Tom Sizemore video  That I was originally gonna do or be a part of or something 
[03:17:00]  And, uh, so how, how was it?  Which one was he?  Um, which, which one were you with Tom Sizemore?  Didn't you play the manager?  I was selling the dog, the dog shit  Wait, were you, were you the, were you the boss guy or the other guy?  The boss guy was  Oh, okay, you're the boss, yeah, very funny, man  Yeah, you're a real prick  The fox is hilarious  It's gonna make me a star tonight on TBS  I'm gonna go from sewage on Parks and Rec  Yep  Where I'm working, uh, novelty items with Tom Sizemore  But you're also  I live in that dumpster, which is nice  Yeah, yeah, that was a nice dumpster 
[03:17:30]  You're also, uh, gonna start a, a talk show, right?  Listen, uh, we're actually shooting a show right now  It, it's called The Test  And it's gonna premiere in September  It's a one-hour conflict resolution  And I am the host of this show  So it's syndicated  And in September, it's gonna be on TV every day  Wow, who's your competition?  Who do we have to knock out?  Uh, I don't think there's gonna be any competition for this  We're going after Jerry Springer?  Who are we going after with this?  Listen, I think we're gonna go right past those guys  Nice  It's not the same wheelhouse, but, uh, the difference is 
[03:18:00]  You got, you have me hosting  And it's just not about the fighting now  No  This is about the resolution  And we're actually helping people  So I'm digging it  Right, very cool  Also what I wanted to say  Yeah  You know, if any of your guests want to be on the show  Because we are, we are in production right now  If they, uh, if they need a, if they need anything answered  Lie detector, DNA, drug, whatever they need  You know, I'll fly them out to L.A.

Yeah, he's gonna want to just be out there in public  Why don't we put, uh, George Zimmerman on your show?  Oh, yeah  Bring all the guests together today  And then Ozzy could be like the house band for you  Ozzy was fucking hilarious  I'd like to get Ozzy on that show  And, and, and Kirk, you were a professional tennis player too, sir  I did have my moments out there  But that didn't last too long 
[03:19:00]  I, I had trouble, uh, getting to the net  But, but you were really good  I still am good  No, you're, you're okay now  You were really good back in the day  You know, I, I was great  But, uh, I, I don't think I utilized my gifts  And then is it true that you became a tennis instructor?  Well, what else are you supposed to do?  I, I think every  You're a funny guy, a creative guy  I was a tennis pro  Yeah, oh, you were a tennis pro  Well, I was a professional for a little bit 
[03:19:30]  Right  And then I started teaching tennis in Beverly Hills  I even made a movie about it a few years ago with Donald Logue  Uh-huh  Tennis anyone?  So tennis is a part of my life  Did you, uh, get to, like, uh, you know  Show the, show those hot women, uh, move or two  On the tennis court?  I mean, isn't that what you're supposed to do?  Yeah, I don't think  I made sure my shorts were extra small  And I always would leave a little hanging out  You didn't have to teach  If that's, if that's throwing bait out  Then that's  You threw some bait out 
[03:20:00]  Throwing bait out  Just a hint of a nut  I didn't show me on the tennis court  But, you know, that's how you get people to  Right, just  Just let that nut just kind of peek out every once in a while  When you're a fucking nut  When you're fucking leaning toward the fucking  I want to be on  I want to be on your prank show  I have an idea for a good prank  Oh, I have a good idea  We're past the prank show  That's our prank show's done, Jimmy  We're done, man  Why don't you be on the test and come out here and, uh

[03:22:30]  He just, like, bows ahead  Well  When I do a prank, I want people to think that their life would be better if they weren't living  I actually got, I got a talking to, because when we were filming this, uh, the guy pulls me aside and said  You're way too happy that these people are scared shitless  Oh, really?  The guy goes, there's a balance  Obviously, you gotta, you know, you gotta pop in, like, and put it over the top  But you gotta play it just right  They're like, you were way too into the fact that these guys are fucked

Does it really?  It's no longer about the victim  Yeah  I love  I flew to LA, let me show you something 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, I loved it  I loved it  I really enjoyed doing the show  We'll see how it, we'll see how it works in the end  Tonight, huh?  And we'll see if I win, man, because I'm up against, what?  Paul Rodriguez and Russell Peters tonight  Oh, come on  You can't fail with them  Yeah  Well, my prank is a good one  Oh, Jimmy, yes, your prank  I want to do a prank show  Let me hear what your prank is, Jimmy  Geez  For the second season of Who Gets the Last Laugh  Yes, that's what I'm saying  If they pick up the show for next year  It's where we tell a family  Yeah  Hey, you have one free dinner in a restaurant 
[03:24:00]  But you must dine this evening  So when family goes to a restaurant  And they have their free dinner  You rob them?  No  But the way you do, though  You give them a bill  And you say, no, your free meal in restaurant  Was not tonight  And they go, hey  And then when they get home  You've burned down their house  And they come down  And their house is in flames  See, I didn't see that coming  No, but then the joke is that 
[03:24:30]  We've moved your furniture to another home  Oh, oh, oh  So the furniture's saved?  We're into an apartment somewhere  Well, it's great  It's an apartment  Fireman that just comes in  And just, you know, robs them  Or charges them money right there  To put the fire out  Yeah  I see something here  Burn their house down  Yeah, and then say, hey  You gotta, you know  You gotta pay us before we turn this hose on  Hey, there's food in your stomach  So you would let a nut slip out on the tennis court  Just to kind of do a little chumming, huh? 
[03:25:00]  Well, listen  Chumming  You gotta do what you gotta do  Chumming  And I listened to you on the Jay Moore podcast  And I texted you, obviously, about it  But I want to say it on the air  Your dad was a very unique individual, sir  Bamboo Ben  Bamboo Ben would just  From heart  He would just wander the beach out there  Well, listen  He had a  He was going in the same direction every morning  He wasn't walking in circles  But he would do three miles every morning  In the deep sand 
[03:25:30]  And every couple hundred yards  He'd reach for the heavens and say Raya  And he'd have a couple hundred people following him  And he was my Forrest Gump  Right  Yeah, the guy actually had followers  From really walking around the beach  Day after day  Not just on Twitter  I mean, he had real followers  He had the real ones  Not the actually followers  Not the goofy ones that we all have  Real followers that believed in Raya  Mike Forrest, yeah  When he was running  Which is air backwards, obviously  Your dad was all about the air backwards 
[03:26:00]  Every morning he'd get out  He'd wake up  And he'd say  Isn't it wonderful?  And we'd say  What?  What is so wonderful?

Jackie didn't like the film  No  That's true  That's a good point too 
[03:35:30]  Sydney  Sydney  You're excited about the film  Yeah  It was good  But Jackie says it was bad  Is this the moment  Finally  Separate them  They're not getting along  You didn't like it  It was just too much graphic  What do you mean graphic  It's a film  Like  Like what  You were just looking for an audible experience  No but you can  You can tell the person  From the green screen  Like they  It just clashed  Is that true Sydney?  No it was awesome 
[03:36:00]  It was put together perfectly  Jackie doesn't know what the fuck  She's talking about  Does she?  I don't know  I was disappointed in the fact  That it wasn't a musical  Oz The Great and Powerful  The James Franco  Wizard of Oz prequel  What do you mean it wasn't a musical?  It should be a musical  Right  And that's what pissed me off  It was ridiculous  It pissed me off too  I know  But other than that  It was really really good  It's all in IMAX 3D  Not according to Jack Hay  Maybe that's what you needed  You needed the IMAX 3D  Did you see it in IMAX 3D?  Do they have IMAX 3D in Rochester?  That hasn't gone up there yet  No we're not that heck  We do have IMAX

[03:37:00]  Yeah  Broadcast extraordinaire  That's right  What makes you say that  About me today?  Because I just love your show  It's amazing  Thank you very much  What's your name?  My name is Jason  Jason do you want one of these  Wizard of Oz  Great and Powerful DVD things  That Roland just gave me?  Certainly  My son would enjoy it  Alright well I'm going to give it to you  So stay on the line  That's line 6 for you in there  E-Rock  E-Rock  How did it feel?  It's always exciting when a guest comes in  And they're familiar with the show 
[03:37:30]  Especially when they're a news noteworthy type of guest  And today we had a very very topical news noteworthy guest  In George Zimmerman's brother Robert  What's going on?  What are you telling him in his years?  No it's something for Roland  What is it?  What's the wrong Roland?  The guest  What guest?  I just text Greg to come back  Oh the comedian?  Yeah  What's his name again?  Mike Cannon  Mike Cannon  Yeah Mike Cannon's coming in here today  Very famous comedian 
[03:38:00]  Everybody knows who he is  E-Rock  E-Rock  Big  New  Noteworthy  Guest comes in  The lawyer  Of Robert Zimmerman  Do we have  How he entered the studio?  And to preface it though  Downstairs  Do you want to know where it is?  He wasn't  Sal you isolated it?  Oh fuck yeah  Son of a bitch  He was an Uber fan  He walked up to me and said  Roland  I'm going to teach you how to swim  I'm like what?  Like he knew everybody  And that only happened yesterday  Yeah  So this was Robert Zimmerman  George Zimmerman's brother  Of course George Zimmerman 
[03:38:30]  Is the guy  Who's going on trial  For the murder of Trayvon Martin  His brother Robert Zimmerman  Who's been very outspoken  In the defense of his brother George  Was on the show today  Very interesting guy  Talking about  Some of the death threats  And things like that  That he's been through  And the way he feels  The media has treated  His brother throughout this whole case  Well  Before we got into  Any of the news  He walked in here  With his lawyer  Robert Zimmerman did  And this is what his lawyer 
[03:39:00]  Entered the studio with  Entering the studio  Robert Zimmerman  George Zimmerman's brother  Gentlemen  How you doing man?  Pleasure  It's Slavo  Oh  You think it's out of control now Eric?  Do you think it's starting to get  A little out of control?  Yeah because it's forced  What do you mean it's forced?  Because Roland tells people  To say this shit  Did you tell him to say it?  I swear to Jesus  This one  When he walked in  He goes  I gotta say Slavo  He goes  When I walk in  He goes  Walking in trouble 
[03:39:30]  I go no  We're selling radio  You can say whatever you want  You think Roland's telling guests  To yell Slavo?  I think so  Not this one  Do you believe him?  That he didn't do it this time?  The second one I told him to do  Before he left  Yes  The second and the third  Oh gee  It was a third  It was a third one  No he was trying to  But at the first time  He was so excited  He goes  I gotta yell it  I gotta yell it  I'm like  Yell away  But do you believe him?  That the first one was all  I'm looking at his face  Probably the first one wasn't 
[03:40:00]  But the others were  I know  I saw Roland telling him  So then  So then isn't that exciting?  No  The guy who's representing  George Zimmerman's brother  Is a big enough fan  That he's yelling Slavo  When he walks in the room?  Highly educated  So he does comedy  Exactly  Is that what it is?  They teach comedy in law school?  Yeah  Yeah  I don't know  Is that where you learned it  Mike Cannon?  It is not  In law school?  He did not  Mike Cannon just walked in  He's headlining Caroline's tonight  Right?  Yep  How's it going man?  Young comedian  How are you?  I'm good  Good  How old are you? 
[03:40:30]  I'm 28  Okay  So yes  Young comedian is right  How long have you been doing this for?  Like five years  A little over  Okay  How many times have you headlined Caroline's?  This is my second time  I did it for the first time last June  Is that kind of like the mecca?  It is man  To me  I mean if you know  You told me when I was 18 years old  That I would headline Caroline's  That would be ridiculous  Have you wanted to be a comedian forever?  Yeah  But I didn't know that it was a viable option  Right  To make a living  So I always just wanted to kind of  I think I heard somebody else say this too  But I always wanted to just be the funny version of a job  Like I never put it together that you can be a comedian 
[03:41:00]  I just wanted to be like a funny teacher  Okay  Yeah  Whatever job you fell into  I was going to be hilarious  You just be the funny guy  Exactly  Were you the funny guy in high school?  I was yeah  I was like a jock  And I played sports and all that stuff  You were a jock and the funny guy?  Yeah  That's fucking  That's bullshit  I'm damaged enough though  Are you?  Yeah  How could you be?  If you were the jock and the funny guy  You're probably getting laid in high school  I did a little bit  You did right?  Yeah  You say that though 
[03:41:30]  Like you're ashamed of it  I almost am  Because the comedian thing is like the loser  Right  Yeah  Who had to develop this sense of humor as a defense mechanism  Sure  Yeah  It really didn't kind of come full circle  Until my parents got a divorce and a bunch of friends died  Okay  That was like okay  And your parents or your friends died?  My friends died  Okay that's good  You got that working for you  It worked out  How old were you when your parents got divorced?  I was between 20 and 21  Okay now  I could go in two directions  Some people  They go 
[03:42:00]  It's really not a big deal at this point  They're probably better off divorced  I'm raised  Right  You know I'm not a kid anymore  I can handle this  Whereas other people are like  My whole childhood has been erased  Sure  Was this difficult for you?  It wasn't so much that my whole childhood was erased due to the divorce  It was probably due to the behavior of one of my parents afterwards  It didn't go well?  No I mean my dad was kind of weird  We also lived together like just him and I right after college  And was it one of those weird like we're sharing an apartment 
[03:42:30]  And you're like dad now you're like a person  And we had like almost like bang offs for an entire summer  Like we were just trying to see who could sleep with more girls  Is that right?  Yeah  I mean and plus that was just at the height of when I just started abusing booze  And your dad was like I'm with you dude  I'm right there with you  Well the odd thing was is that he held judgment against  He was like you can't drink I've been sober  But you know bring it home as many  So that's what happened  Like so your dad's sober  Yeah  But he's still like we just we gotta get girls 
[03:43:00]  Yeah I mean we never did it together  He just like several times walked in on me in the living room  Just spread eagle ass naked  And it was like I know what happened  Yeah  But there was no sort of we're in the same bedroom  Foot high five from under the covers  Jersey Shore  Nothing nothing quite like that  I have uh I've walked into a few uncomfortable situations  But nothing uh nothing where I actually caught him in the act  Did you know though when he was bringing home girls  Like he's banging that girl right now?  I knew it from like the next day he would brag about it 
[03:43:30]  Like it wasn't even  Yeah it was like and I'm like dude act like you've been in the end zone before  Like this isn't a big deal  Right oh god I can't imagine  Cause like for me  I couldn't imagine sexualizing my parents  Right  Which yeah that was  But you want to think that you were brought to this earth through immaculate conception  Yep  And that your parents like they get along  Kind of  You don't even want them to get along that well  But there's certainly no physical attraction left  That's a good point  Whenever I see parents that are actually like super romantic 
[03:44:00]  And very into each other I think about how uncomfortable that must be for their children  Like I never really had that problem  My parents even at their top would like you know they're Irish Catholics  So they'd kiss hello and then ignore each other for the next three days  Like once you figured out what sex was and what it looked like  Uh when people were having sex you're like those two people do not  Yeah I never  I never want to picture that whatsoever  And they made sure that I didn't I wasn't allowed to picture it  Right  Cause that's the weird part of an Irish Catholic household  So then what did your mom think of your dad just kind of roomating with you 
[03:44:30]  She I mean she's the one that kind of forced the hand at the time  Because uh you know I rebelled right after the divorce  It kind of hit me a little a little harder than I'd like to admit  It must have been an ugly divorce for Irish Catholics  Those are some stubborn people  Yeah yeah it was it was just a weird thing  Because then he like instantly started dating  And then I don't know it turned into this whole thing  So I  You think he was cheating on her?  No no I just think that he's uh he's a dude  And probably was like alright once this is over  Right like I've been stuck here for 20 years or whatever 
[03:45:00]  All bets are off which I don't even fault him for  Do you know who he was going for?  In terms of what kind of girls?  Yeah  Um  Like was he going for younger women?  He wasn't which actually troubled me  Like  You would have  You would have preferred  Exactly  And my mom is like you know not to be weird  But she's an attractive woman  And like  You find your mom a little  I don't but  You can recognize her  Yes and my friends have made comments about it since I was a kid  So it's  It's common knowledge  You're the funny guy who's a jock and has a hot mom  Sure  Right  And then 
[03:45:30]  And then I want to paint me into a corner  It's a really nice corner to be in  Until everything just goes to shit  Right  Right  So but he started going for older women?  He started going for  Yeah women like his age  Maybe a little older  And like  Apparently on purpose  He told me that he was going for like fives and sixes  It's like cause the pretty ones will  You know they'll break your heart  As evidenced  And I'm like that's  I don't want to hear it  Like  Yeah  You know what that's the two things  You don't want to picture  Your parents having sex  Mmhmm  And like the sort of  Love troubles that you go through 
[03:46:00]  Like oh  Yeah  This girl broke my heart  This girl  You don't want to think that your father is capable of feeling that anymore  Right  I mean I'm in college  So I'm exploring sex quite a bit  Right  And to find out that my old dad is also doing the same thing at a different point of his life  Was like depressing and gross  Cause you think when you're going through all this in college  You're going okay well it's a learning process  Yeah  I've seen all the YouTube videos  It gets better  You know  And like I'm sure that at some point I'll mature into 
[03:46:30]  And then you look at your dad in the next room  And you're like oh no  Like oh god I'm doomed  It actually gets worse  Even when I was a kid though  Like he was never really sexually appropriate  In terms of what he said  Like cause I was  He acted like once I hit 13  We were boys  Like that was it  Like we would go golfing together  And he'd light up a cigar  And he goes  Tastes so good  It's like pussy  And I'm like I'm 14  When you were 14  Yeah  14  See at first I was like  Oh my god he's smoking a cigar around you  And then it's  Like pussy 
[03:47:00]  Yeah  The only  Sort of sexual interaction  That I had in terms of talk  With my parents  Was at one point  I was probably like  I was probably like 15  I was probably a little older  Than I even should have been  But my dad  I'll never forget  He was  He'd just gotten home from work  And I was sitting at the computer  Cause I know I was sitting at the computer  Cause I never made eye contact with him  Right  And he's in the hallway  And he goes  You know  Sam  We're gonna need to have one of the  Talk  Soon 
[03:47:30]  And I was like  What about  And I knew  But I'm like what about  Yeah  Oof you never want to admit that you know  Right  And he goes  You know  Man to man talk  He said  And I'm just looking at the computer  Going  Ah no it's alright  And he goes  What do you mean  And I go  I know everything  I'm good I got a book  And he goes  How do you know everything  TV  And then  He said the phrase  That made me realize  That he wanted to be there  Even less than I did  Okay  That was it  It was just  Thank god  That was the whole thing 
[03:48:00]  My first sexual talk  With my parents  Came after I was already  Kind of taking care of myself  So like this one time  I was walking into my parents bedroom  They're watching TV  In the living room  So I went to the second TV  And I just hear my mom go  Kevin  Talk to him  And he  And he just follows me  And he goes  Listen  Uh  Just stop doing it  Into the towels  Oh god  Is that true  Yeah that's totally true  And he was like  You're  It's like  They're breakable  At this point  He's like you can't  Well what were you doing  How old were you  I was like 15 
[03:48:30]  16  So you're like 15  Of course  That's when you're jerking off  Like crazy  Like an animal  Just coming home every day  I remember sitting in high school  Being like  Oh my god  It's last period  That means I'm gonna get to go home  And jerk off  Yeah  It's just like  Something to be excited about  I know a lot of people  That didn't even wait  I know a bunch of my buddies  Were just in the bathroom  Like can I get a hall pass  Or you'd see the one weirdo  Who's sitting under the lab desk  And he's just like rubbing  Grinding on a textbook  And you're like  That's  Like your buddy  That goes to the bathroom  To jerk off  You're like  That's kind of funny  The weirdo is in the back  Like 
[03:49:00]  Pleasuring himself  Yeah  Earth science  Is like I don't  I had some girls say  That they would position a textbook  On their lap  In a certain way  And kind of take care  Of themselves  What with like the spine  I think the corner  Which actually seems  Really uncomfortable  Yeah  But I don't know  I mean I don't know  What that anatomy is  Anyway  I don't know how that works  But  So you'd be what  Jizz staining all your towels  I was ruining all the towels  I had two sisters  So  And you didn't think to like  Throw them  So you just  I just  I used  Or a tissue 
[03:49:30]  Grossly enough  I used one towel  Specifically  And I just kept it  Behind my door  It's my lucky towel  Yeah  I was like whatever  At least they'll  Not notice  That a lot of towels  Are missing  It's just one  And I guess my mom  Was kind of poking  Around my room  And noticed that  There was kind of  A boulder towel  Behind my door  And just instantly  Was like  Alright  Hitting the desk with it  I used to be like  Obsessive with making sure  There was no evidence  Yeah  Because like I said  I didn't want to have  To talk with my dad  There was no sexuality 
[03:50:00]  In my household whatsoever  None  Do you think that hurt you?  Yeah  I mean I didn't know  How to wait  What was going on  With any of these women  And I barely know now  And I'm married  But I mean  I didn't know anything  About any of these women  Until much later  I was in college  Way behind everybody else  Like I don't know  What you guys are doing  But I got a Hulk Hogan DVD  And I'm just watching it  I'm just sitting at home  You guys go out  I don't know what's so great  That's going on out there  I thought you were going to say  You were cranking it  To the Hulk Hogan  Yeah of course  I just was struggling  With a lot  My mom actually 
[03:50:30]  Right after that talk  Got me a book called  What's happening to my body  So after that  I kind of  I got the weird  Like animated  Slash illustrated version  Of what sex  And vaginas  And penises look like  And you're like  Mom this is made  For seven year olds  This is really uncomfortable  This is not age appropriate  It looks like the same people  That drew Berenstain Bears  Yeah  Like it was  It was very similar  Illustration  Berenstain  Berenstain  Or whatever  Brother or sister  But yeah  You just give me a hustler  Or something 
[03:51:00]  Like that's where  The answers are  When you're a teenager  That's where the answers are  Yeah  My mom found a  My mom found a porn  Like a VHS porn  In my closet  And I instantly gave up  My friend that gave it to me  And I got banned  From being friends with him  For like a year and a half  Who was Eddie  It was Rob  I'll say his name  He knows who he is  Yeah totally  He was a bad influence  I used to  I never wanted any evidence  So like I would get myself  Started in the bedroom  And it'd be late at night  And then I'd kind of 
[03:51:30]  Look outside in the hallway  And then waddle to the bathroom  You know kind of  Split legged  Because you don't want  And then always  Jerk off directly  Into the toilet  Oh wow  Like kind of  You know  Point down  So you didn't even  Pull your pants up  To go to the bathroom  In fear that it would  Interrupt your erection  Right  Nice  That's a solid thought  For a kid  Plus you don't know  But I'd bring him with me  Because you don't know  If you pull him up  That might be enough  Stimulation to just  Finish the job right there  When you're a kid  Oh my god  You know  But I'd bring the pants 
[03:52:00]  With me  Because I'm like  If I get caught  After  Walking back  And I'm just  Walking back  To my bedroom  Naked mom  No worries  What's weird about this  But you go directly  In the toilet  Wow  Flush  You're done  Solid aim  Wash your hands  A little bit  Everybody asks  I was in the bathroom  I was just taking a piss  Yeah  And then you  I brought you  You bring your pants  With you  Yeah  Just a real quick  Sounds like a heavy  Milkshakey flow  But sure  Right  Can I check your stream honey  I want to make sure  Everything's alright  I used to think  That the point of masturbation  Was to just get hard 
[03:52:30]  And admire it  Like I didn't know  That there was more  And I think it was  Sixth grade  I read something  That you keep going  Came into German class  The next day  And told my best friend  Rob  The same kid  That gave me the porn  I was like  Dude you keep going  And he was like  Bullshit  And he went home  And just tried it that night  Changed his life  Yeah I remember  I remember that  That process  Of like you start  And you're just like  Well I don't know  How long I'm going to do this for  But I guess I'll stop now  That was fun  And then one day  You get to it  And you're like  What the fuck  Oh my god  I fell asleep 
[03:53:00]  In between  Like the first time  I did it  Because it was taking so long  I didn't know how to do it  I just passed out  Let me go to line two  Area code 225  I don't see your name  But you're on  After Opie and Anthony Live  With Mike Cannon  Who's going to be at Caroline  You just hung up  While I was introducing you  He said his shorts are so stiff  They walk on their own  But he might have a good story  So Mike Cannon  How did you  So you decide after college  That you're going to do comedy 
[03:53:30]  I played basketball  For my first two years  At a junior college  And was prepping to play  After that  I was working out  And stuff  I actually got hurt  I tore my ab  My groin  And got a hernia  At the same time  In one shot  In one shot  Yeah  So I was out  From anything athletic  For six months  Figured out  I started boozing  At that moment  Sure  Nothing left to lose  What else is there  And then at that moment  I kind of realized  To myself  That my favorite part  Of basketball  Was kind of  Crowd reaction  Like I was flashy 
[03:54:00]  I liked to kind of  Show off a little bit  And I liked hearing  All the  Like that kind of stuff  Yeah  You see that's the way  Because I'm a pro wrestling fan  Okay yeah  I completely grew up  On pro wrestling  So anytime I was involved  In any athletic school sport  That was the part  That I liked  Except I didn't have  Any athletic ability  So I just like  Yeah come on guys  Let's go  Like you know  Trying to do macho man  Impressions  Or whatever I could do  I joined the wrestling team  For a little while  That's awesome  You would have been good  On the N1 tour  Just going  Oh baby  Exactly 
[03:54:30]  Exactly  But I was just thinking  I joined the wrestling team  For the entrances  Yeah  And that would be enough  But it wasn't the same thing  At all  Yeah it's interesting  Because like  And also  Just one teacher  In college  Was like  I was super political  My first two years  Of college  Until I learned better  And then  Then this teacher  Was like  You know  You kind of remind me  Of Jon Stewart  And that one compliment  Sent me on a  Career trajectory  Like that's how low  My self esteem is  As a person  Once somebody says  Something nice  I'm like  I'm gonna do that 
[03:55:00]  Yeah  I'm good  He said so  I know it  Thanks dad  I mean teacher  Yeah  Tony  In Long Island  Hey Sam  How are you buddy  Good  How are you  I'm here with  Mike Cannon  He's at Caroline's  Tonight  You're on Long Island  It's close enough  Yeah  Yeah  It's not a bad trip  I don't know  If I'm gonna make it  But yeah  The reason why  I'm calling you Sam  I've been listening  To you a long time  What kind of free shit  You got for me today  Well I'm glad you asked 
[03:55:30]  We got some more  Wizard of Oz  Great and Powerful  Blu-rays  And then  Opie's Sudoku  Puzzle from today  Alright I'll take  I don't want  The Sudoku puzzle  Alright I'll send you  A Blu-ray  Thank you  Alright buddy  I'll put you on hold  Thank you bud  Did you see  Wizard of Oz  The Great and Powerful  I did not  Is that the  James Franco  Zach Braff joint  Yeah  Is Zach Braff in this too  I think he is  I think he's  The Flying Monkey  I hate that guy  Yeah I mean  He's getting a lot of shit  For that whole  Kickstarter thing  I hated him  Before Kickstarter  I hated that  Garden State movie 
[03:56:00]  It was horrible  Oh man see  That's funny  Because the summer  I lived with my dad  In an apartment  I watched that  Every morning  Because of how upset  I was  You're just depressed  Yeah  And you're like  Oh it's my story too  Oh my god  This is just like me  I got so frustrated  Watching that movie  Because all it is  Is  Any bit of emotion  Like when you  Watch that  Because you're depressed  And you're like  Oh it's such an emotional story  And blah blah blah  It's only because  Of the music in it  Yeah  Like every person  That came out of that movie  Is going  The soundtrack was so great 
[03:56:30]  Yeah  I'm like  Zach Braff had nothing  To do with the soundtrack  He just picked the songs  The acting is never mentioned  The acting's not great  The tone the music set  He wrote the movie  It's not a well written movie  It's not particularly  Well directed  It's just  He made a long music video  To some songs he liked  He made a mixtape  That's hilarious  A mixtape music video  Yeah  And it drove me crazy  How many people  Like that movie  It just appealed  To entitled white people  That didn't know  How to feel like sad  Yeah I guess that's the thing  For like somebody like you  Yeah  Who had never dealt 
[03:57:00]  With any kind of loss  Right  Or sadness  You're like  I thought I win everything  Though  I don't understand  That now  This Zach Braff thing  Is like  Oh my god  There are people  With sorrow in this world  Right  He's just like me  But uh  Yeah I didn't see  This Oz movie  I was talking to  The two girl interns  One of them said  It was great  One of them said  It was horrible  Yeah I heard  I didn't hear  It was that great  I don't know  I know Mila Kunis  Is in it  She's pretty smoking hot  Yes  Mila Kunis  I can get behind  Yeah  Literally  Buzzing  But 
[03:57:30]  The new Superman movie  Comes out  Yeah I want to see that man  Yeah I do  Well I don't know  Yeah I want to see it  It looks  Here's the thing  The trailers look cool  But I feel like  The last movie  With Kevin Spacey  And him in it  Remember  I didn't see it  But I  Because I heard  Oh really  I heard it was so atrocious  It's terrible  And for me  Like it ruined the franchise  Like it's good  That you didn't see it  Because now  I can't take a Superman movie seriously  Yeah I can kind of look at it  With a clean slate  And I love Christopher Nolan  So  Right  I'm on board with that whole  Dark superhero stuff 
[03:58:00]  Right  Like all the Batman movies  Oh my god  Yeah I'm obsessed with those  I love Tom Hardy  Just Bane  He was such a badass  I would like Tom Hardy  But you know  He's one of those  Guys that like  Girls like so much  Right  You start to be like  Yeah he's the man  And then every girl in your life  Is like oh my god  He's so hot  And you're like  He's not that great  Yeah you know  This kind of sucks really  I'm going to rebel  Against your positive opinion  Even though I thought similarly  Yeah  And you think that maybe  If you start shitting on him  A little bit  Women will be less  Less attracted to him  Right 
[03:58:30]  Because your opinion  Is so valued  You know  You're just like  You know what  I hate those supple pillow lips  They're so dumb  Yeah yeah  Thanks for reminding me  They're awesome  Yeah and his accent  How horrible is that  I love it  Shouldn't have brought up  The accent  Looking for flaws  And there aren't any  Tom in Madison  Hey guys  What's up Tom  Love you Sam  I can't believe someone  Would not want  Opie's Sudoku puzzle  How do you feel about Mike Cannon  You can't just call up  And say I love you Sam  And like leave Mike Cannon  Left out  He's doing Caroline's tonight 
[03:59:00]  Mike's doing a great job  At the visions of  Me and my father  Potentially being in a situation  Where we could potentially  Screw the same girl  Who get caught in the act  Was kind of horrifying  But no  If I was on the east coast  I'd be coming to see you brother  No doubt  Excellent  I appreciate it man  Alright so you won  Opie's Sudoku puzzle  Yeah yeah absolutely  Okay Tom and Madison  Hold on  You won the Sudoku puzzle  So that's when  It all started falling apart  And then you decided  To take a comedy  Yeah  Cause I went to  I actually went to 
[03:59:30]  The same college as Opie  I went to Geneseo  Geneseo  Yeah and I joined  Some weird like  Sketch group  Where we did like  Kind of the local TV stuff  But that was my first  You know  Foray really  Into comedy  And I felt really  Intimidated  Cause everybody else  Had been doing it  For a while  So I was like  I don't like this  Team stuff  And then I just  Started doing  A few open mics  Every couple months  In Rochester  Which you wouldn't believe  But shit and piss jokes  Killed  Yeah  They love that  In Rochester  Oh my god  I left there doing  Like four shows total  In like 18 months  Thinking like 
[04:00:00]  I am on the fast track  Because I am crushing  With these urinal bits  Yeah not realizing  That maybe the bar  Was a little lower  Than you had  Originally thought  Yeah they're talking  About garbage plates  So I  Because one of our  Interns is from  Rochester  Okay  And yesterday in the office  I'm sitting there  And I'm talking to her  And she said something  About the south  And I'm like  You realize that the south  And upstate New York  Are the same place  The exact same place  With different accents  Oh man dude  And she's like  No the food's better upstate 
[04:00:30]  And I was like  What?  No way  That's a horrible argument  She's like  Garbage plates  Garbage plates are really good  To feel sad  Like that's one of the things  That you eat  That's like  This is delicious  And then three minutes later  You're like  I wish I didn't do any of that  Like disco fries  And stuff  Yeah  I mean  If you live up there  You tend to think  That anything is amazing  Because there's such little  To do  This is her  This is Jackie  She's from Rochester  From Rochester  And she  Are I going to get yelled at now?  Her accent's horrible  It is awful 
[04:01:00]  They make fun of me all the time  But  Dad  Yeah  Well I'd say sale  Like instead of  It's like  Yeah that's the one  That's pretty bad  I didn't say the south  It was necessarily  You said  You specifically said  That the food upstate  Was better than in the south  It was  It's a specific thing  We have in Rochester  Rochester  It's a specific thing  We have in Rochester  It's whatever  I'm over  I love my accent  You do?  I do  You shouldn't  I do  You want to get into  Broadcasting though  I know  I mean I guess I should talk 
[04:01:30]  Right?  My voice is horrendous  And I've been told that  At least it's not like  A Staten Island one  That's really thick  I don't know  I have to take classes  To go  You really think  Is that bad?  Would you rather have  A Staten Island accent  Or a Rochester accent?  I would rather  I would rather have  A Staten Island accent  I think so too  Where are you originally from?  I'm from Rockland County  New York  I mean initially  Right outside of West Point  But then I moved there  I'm with you  Westchester right here  So I'm with you  Right outside the city  Is where you need to be  Of the affluent Jew  That's right  People think that 
[04:02:00]  But you know what  People forget  Yonkers is Westchester  That's true  Yeah  Mount Vernon is Westchester  There are no affluent Jews  In Mount Vernon  No they're not  I used to play basketball  In Yonkers on School Street  I played with Jadakiss one time  Really?  Yeah it was absolutely hilarious  And he was Jadakiss at the time?  He was Jadakiss  Yeah oh  He was wealthy  He refuses to leave the hood  Refuses  I love it about him  But he used to like  Throw no look passes  That he would release the ball  And then like a second later  Would look away  So it wasn't so much  Of a you know 
[04:02:30]  No look passes  It was just a weird  Kind of misdirection  Was he throwing out  His weird bird call things  That aren't really bird calls  Yeah  Oh yeah  Oh my god  I wanted to tell you  You know  We were talking about your dad  You know Father's Day is here  It's on Sunday  Is that I had no idea  To be honest  Yes  And you don't want to get  To add another pair  Of those glasses  That help you find  Golf balls in the weeds  Do you?
