<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie graphically detailing his son's first vaccination experience, focusing on the child's distress and his own feelings of helplessness.  He launched into crude jokes about the pediatrician's appearance. This segued into a discussion of childhood injuries, with callers sharing anecdotes about accidents and mishaps.  A police officer caller recounted performing CPR on his children, leading to a discussion about CPR success rates and the prevalence of childhood injuries.  The conversation then veered into wedding experiences, both from the hosts and callers, including a memorable Christmas Eve wedding.  A caller from Israel introduced Jewish customs and traditions, prompting discussion of other religious practices.  Further tangents included the lack of unsupervised childhood play, the cost of bicycles, and a humorous viral video of Slayer music overlaid on Pentecostal church footage.  No guests were in-studio beyond Opie and Anthony.

The show continued with a discussion of the recent arrest of Russian spies in New York, focusing on their seemingly amateurish operation and the female spy's attractive appearance.  This transitioned into a lengthy segment on the BP oil spill and criticisms of the Obama administration's response, particularly concerning the Jones Act.  A chief engineer in the merchant marine, Raymond, called in to clarify details about the Jones Act.  The ensuing discussion involved multiple callers debating the government's handling of the crisis, with one caller presenting contradictory documentation.  LeBron James's impending free agency was briefly discussed before the show was significantly dominated by a heated and extended phone call with a listener named Dan.  This involved a contentious and highly personal debate about Sarah Palin, political ideology, and various other topics, characterized by insults and accusations of misogyny from both sides.  Multiple other callers joined in, escalating the argument.

The segment with Dan continued, with the hosts mocking Dan's claimed occupation as an optometrist and accusing him of being lonely and sexually frustrated, while Dan boasted about his chess skills and alleged spelling bee championship.  This argument, filled with insults and interruptions, concluded before Alex Jones joined the show.  Jones and the hosts then engaged in a discussion covering various conspiracy theories, including the JFK assassination and 9/11 attacks. Jones presented evidence he believed challenged the official narratives, while the hosts expressed skepticism and pointed out contradictions.  A caller, Rocko, supported Jones's work.  The discussion included the New World Order, geoengineering, government manipulation, and detailed arguments regarding evidence surrounding the JFK assassination.  Further discussion included topics such as the authenticity of Bin Laden videos, the moon landing, Watergate, and the health of past presidents, with Jones offering his perspective and cited sources.  Jones also discussed his films, notably "The Obama Deception," and made claims about government conspiracies related to vaccines, fluoride, and staged events like the BP oil spill, including allegations of the CIA faking Bin Laden videos, poisons in food and vaccines, and the government collecting babies' blood.  He also claimed he'd been offered money and positions to alter his message.

[00:06:30]  but you would think after all these years they could figure something out still a metal tube that  they stick in you and inject fluid through it so uh so uh she hits him with the shots i'll  i'll fast forward this this story right into his fat fucking thighs the kid turns beet red holds his  breath and just loses his mind so then my my wife loses her mind i grabbed the kid to try to calm him  down so now he thinks i'm the evil one because yeah because i was the one that he saw first after 
[00:07:00]  this horrible pain and and uh whatever i mean now i'm gonna get sappy freaking out oh yeah oh jesus  yeah you know her she's oh no so he's just losing his fucking mind beet red screaming bloody murder  and just like you said welcome to life for your first little he didn't have any of this shit  before yesterday there was nothing but presents and colorful things and mobiles and shook shookers  under the chin yeah a little pat on the head is this shot like that or all they just do all three 
[00:07:30]  real quick she tried to go quick but each shot was just hell on earth for this damn little thing  and then uh i sort of calmed him down and then he was uh pretty much miserable all day yesterday  and you just feel like like like shit really you feel like shit you're like this is yeah i brought  you into this lovely world and here's your here's your first shot of holy shit life sucks it is  right there'll be plenty more of this before you die of old age yeah it's like the whole life is just 
[00:08:00]  full of these this is every relationship you'll ever be in every job you'll ever have right it's  just everything this is your car breaking down this is but the first seven or eight weeks of uh  of your life is you know i finally figured out that's what they say when you have a kid you relive  your life basically so obviously we went through the the shot thing way back in the day as we all say 
[00:08:30]  of course and you know the first seven or eight weeks was gravy fucking gravy but this is what  life is really about this shit kids don't get that inoculation thing anymore huh right in the arm  where we know where they well that's where i think 68 wasn't that the last year they have the one with  the scar yeah that's where you show your age if you want to not much that's fucked up like every kid  was marked yeah yeah i have that yeah yeah you do you guys got a little one too those those shots  were done in school weren't they i don't even know i remember lining up in school to get the 
[00:09:00]  bullshit shots where everyone was that was the gun yeah it was that fucking gun they put it up to  your arm and went like oh is that what the scar is yeah it's just like would push the fluid right  into your is that polio i don't know is that the polio one i don't know i remember pox i remember  someone's saying pat from unaki saying small pox yeah small cox but remember uh you got word that  it's going to be shot day and then yeah and in our school system which was harborfield's uh well  harborfield's high school washington drive i'll go real local in centerport they lined everyone 
[00:09:30]  buddy up in the gym and you line up good boy johnny and you saw every you saw everybody crying there  wasn't one that escaped crying from that shot it was just a miserable day for everybody it was a gun  and then they like screw some freaking uh little thing on top of it and then yeah you get it on  your arm like a star trek kind of kind of thing and then boom and and yeah it left a scarf for the  rest of your life you just like fucking marked the children i bet there's a conspiracy theory about 
[00:10:00]  that oh i'm sure yeah so it was uh i was one of those sad days yesterday you know yeah then the  kid was just whining and crying not whining just like like what the hell was that man fuck no more  of that please but then by the time i left this morning he seems like he's uh he's he's back to  snapping back he's snapping back pretty quickly which is good one bad memory now there you go you  got one that's count them keep going that's the first set of shots i think i think he's got to do 
[00:10:30]  another oh shit yeah it's more yeah they warned uh warned us said well the next visit in a month  will just be a checkup but then then we're going back to this horror show wow i didn't think i thought  they did it all in one shot or something and you talked to doctors and stuff and they said the kid  won't even remember that memory and stuff but come on somewhere deep in your dna all that shit builds  up i'm thinking yeah right they say other shit like that kids do remember when they supposedly don't  remember anything why not the you know shop things they say your whole personality is formed before 
[00:11:00]  you're two like whatever's gonna make you like the different stuff comes after but you you have  your basic core by the time you're two so you remember everything that was a pediatrician white  yeah is that but who who gave the shot there's a very very black or white no she was a monster  white woman oh see i figured they said the black nurse and it's a whole racial thing yeah i guess  it starts us disliking each other very young i guess i'm trying to remember what mine was  you know my my kid's gonna hate fat chicks like his father because and chin hair fucking chin hair 
[00:11:30]  god damn man get rid of that stuff and then i'm looking at her thinking i don't trust you i i think  you would smother a kid oh she looked like one of those i'm having these thoughts as as she comes  in with the needles yeah like misery yeah woman yeah yeah exactly was she a treat kathy bates kathy  bates and misery who turned a little scrapbook she turned 60 yesterday did she yeah get to that  yesterday but she uh the big 60 for kathy that doesn't seem so fucked up because she's always 
[00:12:00]  just looked old and frumpy yeah because misery has to be at least mr man 95 98 i'm gonna go yeah okay  i was gonna say definitely over 10 years ago i think it's even i think it's probably older than that  perhaps older than that well who's saying 95 that's 15 misery was 1990 yeah 90 20 years ago  that was a long time ago she was 40 in that i love that movie i don't know why but that was it oh it's  a great one that was one of the james conden is so good in that yeah i saw that in the movie theater 
[00:12:30]  yeah the whole and i mean i i think people have seen it already at the end when she comes you know  for that final comeback the whole movie theater jumped like i felt the earth actually move itself  like three feet back fantastic when he smashes her head with the typewriter yeah her big fat dumb head  oh that was great oh it's fantastic you're ruining the movie man oh i know never got out of the cock  of duty car yeah it's just fucking weird wow was she enraging in that movie yeah yeah her mr man 
[00:13:00]  mr man like when she comes down with the gun all fucking mellowed out i don't know yeah i'll just come  down here yeah like uh you're a little weird or she noticed her penguin was facing the wrong way  great movie absolutely that's fun that if it's on i'll i'll watch it uh so yesterday was a weird  fucking day for the poor kid yeah a little tater tot let's go to ed in jersey ed hello ed 
[00:13:30]  hey you gotta take a uh infant cpr or choking course big uh i have a one-year-old and she had  a breath holding incident jesus like four months ago i pulled an alarm clock away from her and she  spun away from me and she was crying and then she stopped crying and walked away fell forward and  passed out and when i flipped her over she was blue so i thought she was choking on something or  whatever so i you know i i'm a police officer so i gave her rescue breaths all right you know we had  9-1-1 cup and all that stuff we took her to the doctors and they said that she held her breath so 
[00:14:00]  long that she couldn't regain it actually passed out oh that's great oh yeah and then my three-year-old  about a year and a half ago she was choking on a part of a soft pretzel and uh i flipped her over  pointed her down and gave her back blows and dislodged it but you know this is stuff that you never  ever expect you know so you really should take one of them what about let me ask you hold in the  breath they don't care she's like you know i've made the right decision i don't really i don't  really need to do this i'd rather just hold the head of a puking hungover girl right same thing you 
[00:14:30]  don't know if they're going to survive yeah it was weird she had vomit all over her i was wiping her  down and wasn't sure she was going to make it to morning had to hold her hair back it was horrible  terrible scene at my house pounder on the back with a clean ass because my cum was all over  what is the holding the breath thing is that is that a lesson the kid learns like as a way to  make the parents panic what is the holding the breath they said she does it like she's done it a 
[00:15:00]  couple times we just did it last week but she didn't pass out she she at the last second she  takes the breath so now she's like you know one year and four months but um the doctor said they  can't die from it but i didn't know i she just went out cold on time sounds like her and like  your body actually passes out and then they kick into overdrive but it's like what's in there  mind like are they doing this to like i'll show him or not on purpose they they hold their breath  they're so pissed and then they like panic it's almost like a little like panic attack because 
[00:15:30]  then they can't regain their breath and then they get yeah i think it's because i know in cars  in cartoons when i was growing up they'd always show like the little kid when when it was mad it  would fold its arms and go and hold its breath and turn all kinds of color breathe finsta breathe  maybe that is to freak out bunny i'd have to like smack baby finsta to uh clarify it for us a little  bit more really dr steve you think he's up this early oh no oh y'all hold its breath  well they'll do that every so often i asked the doctor i said is it possible because you know i 
[00:16:00]  actually cleared her throat thinking there was something lodged in there yeah did the finger  but i asked the doctor i said is it possible that she held her breath for so long that she passed out  and he said absolutely he said it's you know it's pretty common so it's just something once they get  a little bit older that can actually happen jesus christ it doesn't happen well i'm sorry they don't  die from it you know instead of having a uh a really nice fucking smartphone for everybody how 
[00:16:30]  about we figure out the shots for the kids i'd rather have a smartphone i know how about a smartphone  that gives shots yeah smartphone that gives shots now you're talking well you give the kid a phone  after he gets his shots yeah this is nice right now you're talking i'll go i'll go get the brand  new iphone if it if it's you know can do the shot thing properly yeah so did you take any kind of cpr  yeah yeah we know all that shit all right i appreciate it ed know all that shit tough guy  uh fly fishing yeah yeah that'll happen i haven't left my house in eight weeks what are you what are you high 
[00:17:00]  go fly fishing with this guy sounds like every everyone that's around him starts choking for  some reason yeah hey you want a pretzel this guy's the angel of death he hurts people and then saves  them how about you offer a food that's not dry to your guests yeah on the job i'm about over 25 on cpr  calls no lie what do you mean over 25 i've never had a shave and i've done about 25 different times 
[00:17:30]  i've done cpr jesus you stink we haven't what are you getting there the next day you haven't saved  one person with your skills never never they're always i've had the defibrillator on them within  you know a minute or two uh you know different but no i'm telling you it doesn't really work for  adults when they have when they go with the cardiac and stuff wow all right well uh i was gonna  look on your record there yeah you might be you might be the angel of death hopefully you'll uh 
[00:18:00]  yeah anybody that does that i mean i think it's like it's like like five or six percent of the  time you'll actually get an actual save out of a a real cpr save all right but sometimes you do it  like we're still talking like a car yeah yeah i agree i'm gonna start holding my breath  until you stop talking sir all right thank you we gotta give someone else a shot go ahead in  wisconsin cody hey what up my my daughter does that she'll cry she'll hold her breath her eyes 
[00:18:30]  literally will roll in her back of her head her arms dipping right out looks like she's knocked out  cold i started calling her chuck liddell because he keeps doing the same damn thing every time  it's freaking freaky we just took her to the neurologist neurologist said uh yeah it's pretty common  no big deal okay um it doesn't do anything mentally as far as like oxygen to the brain or  anything like that she said uh up to seven years old she's seen kids do it i'm like this is bullshit  diagnosis is uh a bitch your kid's a bitch

[00:19:30]  bullshit the you know god forbid anything even as serious as a broken arm things like that like that  shit just happens to kids and you don't know when or where just you get the phone call oh hi yeah  this is the school uh yeah broken leg broken arm broken foot whatever didn't every one of our  monster rain under the porch yeah i was gonna say didn't every one of us have the the nurse call 
[00:20:00]  our parents or whoever was raising yeah us you know i want to include everybody right i think every  single one of us yep got got that that phone call where we got hit in the head with a hockey stick  a broken arm something we uh i was listening to uh ron and fez uh right here on this very channel at 11  a.m and uh they had a good subject they were bringing up uh the point that you don't see a lot of  kids walking around with casts anymore and i found that like very interesting it's like yeah what the fuck is 
[00:20:30]  that all about like they used to you used to walk around and constantly you'd see kids in fucking  arm casts sure and uh they play safe and that's what that's what uh was brought up with the fact  obvious they're playing video games now they're doing and and there's not a lot of just kids  riding their bikes far like we used to you know go out and ride your bike a few miles and now you  know the parents are so paranoid of abduction and other bullshit that they they they're just playing  fucking xbox it comes down to this kids don't play unsupervised anymore yeah it's all about play 
[00:21:00]  dates supervise and i guess like the playgrounds are a little more safe with some cushioning and  shit we have monkey bars that if you fell through it was like you were a pachinko ball just bouncing  off a fucking metal i remember my sister who was about six years older than me so she was uh  she had to be about 16 or 17 and we had like a we had like a penny saver route it wasn't even a  paper route and i was 10 maybe and we took off on our bikes for a and and she couldn't get a route 
[00:21:30]  near the house it was like 10 miles away from the house so my dad would just drop us off with one bike  and all these penny savers she would do the penny saver route and then we would have to drive drive  our bike one bike home 10 miles i was 10 years old 10 miles that no one cared about kids back then  right get out get out of the house and play they just assumed you would be all right it's it's evil  out there i just want to stay inside did i ever tell you the story of my sister panicking on the 
[00:22:00]  way home that of the 10 mile uh ride after all these years did i ever tell that story where my  sister i should have been driving the bike because she's a panicky pete and it was and it's a and  and it's a hill wait was it one bike with two of you on it yes i always hated that because we  were fucking poor how many times i have to tell you did someone have to sit on the seat and someone  had to stand or was it on the handlebars this is so long ago i think we just kind of shared the seat  or side saddle on the metal bar between the seat and handle right that was always the bad one no 
[00:22:30]  this was just a basic bike it didn't have any pegs or any of that shit so i had to sit kind of maybe  it was a longer seat or something i don't remember exactly banana seat did it have a banana banana seat  and so there was a little hill that we had to go down and my sister panicky pete just fucking  shaking side to side so i go flying off the bike rip up my knee to this day it's still scarred right  yeah we had to like uh limp to the nearest house and they had to call uh somebody to bring me to  the hospital get stitched up blah blah blah so year after year when we pass this hill we always take a 
[00:23:00]  look and the older i got i went you motherfucker this was no fucking hill whatsoever shallower the hill  guy yes yeah my first memory you're thinking it's suicide hill a double black diamond for the  skiers out there and by the time you got you know old enough you realize it was just a simple tiny  little you know decline and she panicked on me nothing worse than having to ride someone on your bike  though i hated that because you would you'd have to stand up while they sat on the seat and it wasn't 
[00:23:30]  like a motorcycle with a nice roomy seat and pegs and shit like that right so they're constantly  their legs are out because then you always hear i heard the horror stories and saw it of the kid  that got his foot caught in the spokes that was always like that happened to all of us shoot up  the foot and then the uh usually the sneaker would protect you though yeah but uh sometimes barefoot i  saw one once that was just horror at a girl did she lose a toe no but it was so shoot it was like 
[00:24:00]  fucking the skin was ripped off the the muscle of of her foot muscle and and she was just i remember  walking home screaming crying and limping with just blood it was like a war zone growing up it was like  the vietnam war you just look and go ah yep she took one in the foot yeah and then there was uh if  your if your uh ankle your your pant leg got caught in the sprocket under the chain because you didn't  have a chain guard because they weren't cool and uh that could suck your uh suck your fucking 
[00:24:30]  calf muscle in that happened to well i didn't get my calf muscle uh ripped off but uh remember back  like in like the early 90s when pipe leg jeans were like the coolest thing ever i was racing my  friend on my bike and my bike didn't have a chain guard and it was probably just at the peak of the  fastest i could possibly be riding a bike my pant leg got caught in the chain and then your foot goes  around and the pedal hits the back of your leg yep and then now it's caught in there it's really 
[00:25:00]  fucked up it hurts i did a few flips it was like an indiana jones movie where he just takes the you  know the stick right through the spokes yeah and you know the bike just goes on three times tumbling  over that was another thing when somebody was on your handlebars they could get it caught in the  front spokes or it was very hard to steer you could get in that wobble factor or they could just fall  off and you would run them over they'd fall off your handlebars and you'd run them over or flip  over very dangerous bike riding back then you don't you again you don't see that either to this 
[00:25:30]  day i i tuck my uh my pants leg in my fucking socks do you you wrap around tuck it in the right one i  tuck in i don't trust uh even the newer bikes uh old school my friend can't happen when you're driving  they got the pegs now yeah they got pegs yeah of course they got pegs fuckers well and you know  what you start a fine topic and it does come down to the fact that kids just don't play unsupervised  anymore unsupervised or as like i don't think they play as crazy and on shit that was just not 
[00:26:00]  fucking safe remember the just the metal fucking monkey bars yeah the playgrounds were all grounds  were just all fucking metal many ways to kill yourself the slide was like a fucking razor blade  and and there were kids that got like third degree burns on that metal slide that was sitting out in  the sun like a frying pan and then a kid in shorts would get up there sit down burn on the back of  your legs the back of your fucking leg kid wouldn't budge it would be going yeah and then just stop 
[00:26:30]  there on a fucking frying pan you ever see ball bag guy ball bag guy dan you've seen ball bag guy  right he went down a slide that had no water oh a water slide water slide with no water supposedly i'm  sure maybe it happened some other way and and uh the skin on his ball bags underneath completely gone  oh yeah yeah that's um someone fucking tweeted i i didn't even think we would bring it to air and  all of a sudden we are now fuck that's when you put the water yeah those slides that have the little

[00:34:30]  to be 48 miles an hour and it was a donut annoying big fucking how many of our jelly  donut how many of our listeners are awkwardly putting down a donut right put the donut down  it's fucking as they listen to your story do you know last night had a tuna sandwich like your pal  anthony i went to a wedding last night my buddy norm got my it was amazing oh the monday night wedding  unbelievable and uh tom papa did the ceremony he's actually allowed to do weddings they made it fun  it was fucking great wow he's like a reverend or something yeah he had to go online and do it 
[00:35:00]  but the food they had was uh great and then after i ate three very thin slices of ice cream cake and  then i had carrot cake and then i had like a brownie and i went home jimmy i almost shit in the car  i had to shit i was driving bobby and don home because they came with us and they had to drive  and as i'm driving them it was like that feeling like you're driving it's like oh  what do you think you're gonna shit your pants i was driving i'm like all right we just gotta i gotta 
[00:35:30]  get through this light because i can't stop it  did your foot come off the pedal at all dude that was exactly that kind of shit when you have  to lift your feet off the pedal you lift your cheek up you lift your oh it was fucking terrible  start working the gas at your left foot to give your right foot like it's cramping up boy man that  rectum it really does just it's linked to every single part of your body but usually uh the cake 
[00:36:00]  doesn't do it ice cream cake the ice cream must have done it yeah it was the ice cream cake mixed  with some kind of meat product i'm thinking yeah well i ate it was a really cool wedding because  you walk into this kind of like it was like a club they had rented and you have the uh the altar at the  uh front and then they have hors d'oeuvres and stuff really good food out on the tables already  wow so people were sitting down it was like a party and then they did a ceremony it was short it was  fucking great man i highly recommend you do a different wedding yeah something unorthodox 
[00:36:30]  get married out there because because to to the average person we've seen the exact same wedding  a million fucking times do something different i don't know what it is just do something different  yeah it's not about money to do something different usually oh the whole the same thing when i get a  when i get a wedding invitation i just cry i'm like i've been through this i know exactly what's  going to happen it's going to be it's going to be like groundhog day it's the exact same fucking 
[00:37:00]  shit over and over again i i'm pretty much done with weddings yeah we're finally old enough where  we don't have to deal with it as much but reach an age where it's like holy fuck late 20s to early  to mid 30s it's everyone you know it's it's wow i get to waste my whole summer going to six weddings  yeah thank you everyone you're right like six fucking weddings it's people your own age and then  other people that failed are on their second one that's what happens like in your 30s yeah like  your 20s all your buddies and shit like that are getting married and then your early 30s it's the 
[00:37:30]  people that fucked up and failed that decided they want to fuck up again and then you got to go to  those weddings and then you're sitting there just going get out of here this is doomed  so doomed worst wedding ever christmas eve because because the people who would do that because they  got the hall cheap i'm like christmas no shit are you fucking crazy who the fuck did that i don't  even want to talk about the person that is so fucking selfish centered and selfish yeah it's like 
[00:38:00]  oh and and they were bragging the whole time like man we got such a great of course you got a great  deal well did you go to it or did you have a little while uh for a little while yeah then you're  just gonna go for a few minutes it was like a it was like an early christmas eve wedding so you  could still kind of do christmas eve but how's that because you gotta people gotta buy shit last  minute you go gift shopping and prepare that tree yeah yeah busy yeah it's the worst fucking day to  have a wedding that was that was the worst ever busy ever a christmas eve wedding i went to a 
[00:38:30]  halloween it was something the whole thing was over by something i don't remember this is a long time  ago now like six or seven at night but even how fun is that a wedding that's over that that's like  why even have a wedding if you're gonna be done by seven at night because they got a great deal on the  hall man yeah uh there was a great one here oh monkey bars in yeah chris in the poconos chris  yeah uh when i was eight years old i slipped and fell on the uh monkey bars it was december so you  know there's frost building up all right i went to one of those they threw me out 
[00:39:00]  but uh they sent me to the office because they thought that i uh knocked the wind out of myself i was  sitting in the nurse's office for like an hour before they realized that you know all the blood  was leaving my face no one believed that a kid could get a concussion back then either but you  lost half your spleen right yeah the bar went up and under my rib cage and uh pretty much and half  the spleen and they had to remove it wow you can live with uh a lot of your spleen gone but yeah but 
[00:39:30]  maybe as a little kid you don't really want to deal with that no wow do you know when i was a child  i was running by the pool in edison new jersey shouldn't run no horseplay and there's the next  to the pool you know how you have what are those it's like a it was like a little rectangle right  next to the pool small and but you could reach in and there was water in it i don't know what it  was skimmer maybe it was a skimmer over the top and open yes the skimmer always knows someone had the 
[00:40:00]  someone had the fucking cover off yes because you should never have to be able to scoop your  hand in that and i fell and i skinned both of my knees i had little bandages on both oh did you i  certainly did i took a cigarette to the eye as a kid fucking split my head open what a cigarette to  the eye running by you know oh my brother got a tennis racket to the head my father was playing  tennis and joe just like walked up he's a little kid a little baby kid he walks up behind my dad 
[00:40:30]  my dad goes for a backswing and just wailed joe right in the head left a permanent scar on him  and then at the bungalow in mastic when we used to go out to mastic here's how white trash  the uh cumia family was is slash is exactly uh we we we summered in mastic nice went to the bungalow  where where they would just throw kids in the pools no such thing as swimmies you just got thrown in 
[00:41:00]  the pool and and and a bunch of drunks tried to watch you and at one point my brother was just sinking  sinking and uh one of the drunk uncles uh grabbed and uh grabbed his hair and pulled him out by his  hair uh and and he says he remembers like sinking down and actually seeing his own face like in the  pool wall like oh and he just kind of looked at it and remembered that and then he was out of the 
[00:41:30]  water wow it's like that episode of mash when hawkeye kept sneezing and itching because a kid came in  smelling like uh clothes that were moldy that was bringing back some weird memory of when he  drowned almost drowned in the lake oh wow i don't remember that one yeah and he said he's and you  know this therapist fixed it in the one episode of course he did he always fixed everything in one  episode because he fell into the water but his cousin pulled it out sigmund yes and he goes i i don't 
[00:42:00]  know but he just he helped me into the water and he goes well you said something there he helped you  into the water another yes and it turns out he had pushed him into the water pushed him and pulled  him out and did hawkeye start crying yes it was very good hawkeye hawkeye was very sensitive oh yes  he was cry all the time yes don't let the bastard win i remember that episode is very big because they  said bastard on regular television and it was yeah it was hawkeye you know yelling at uh at uh that was a  big deal death to hear bastard don't let the bastard wait oh it was a big deal and then the show came 
[00:42:30]  out remember the tv series the bastard the miniseries maybe chuckle every time he's a bastard  on television i don't remember that the bastard either i don't remember that at all followed by  the sequel the motherfucker yes i remember when i said that that margaret uh houlihan had a great  clit that was one that got big big big uh controversy on cbs hey jimmy would you like a miniseries  danny would you would like to explain to george the trucker the the the fuck face in virginia 
[00:43:00]  how my wedding was different your wedding was fucking i have to say overall opie's wedding  it was probably different probably the best wedding i've ever been to and i don't say that  to be polite either it was uh the way it was different was i mean there was a little bit of a  ceremony but it wasn't long and drawn out it was to the point we got a gospel band in a catholic  church try to get that done a gospel band in the church a lot of money to get that done  it wasn't boring how you went all out just to please patrice is beyond me you know what's funny 
[00:43:30]  about the catholic church they uh well whatever i i i hate the catholic church they molest children  right it's funny what but they're all goody two shoes like we're like hey we want to do something  different we want to get a gospel band they're like get the not in our church and then you pull  out the old wallet next thing you know we got them fucking singing and dancing and clapping  then they didn't have a problem with the gospel fucking uh uh people we brought in yeah we're 
[00:44:00]  always open for a donation and the reception it's all the reception that that's what weddings are  it's all the reception because yes you know there's a service there's families you gotta you have to do  something where you're gonna you take this man and you're also whatever you know that's part of it  yeah but the service was fucking first of all there was a live band that was great it wasn't  cheesy there was none of the cheesy shit you do at weddings we put a lot of money into the uh the band  yeah they were fucking and uh there were tables linked together with giant buckets of candy 
[00:44:30]  around them and you could just go and eat all the candy you wanted and everyone spent their time  eating candy yeah reese's pieces fucking every candy you can imagine what about the video game  area didn't you didn't no i didn't go to the video game no oh we had fucking wheeze and all sorts of  shit set up oh yeah wait was that right yes i did see that that was the kids i didn't want people to  sit at their table going when the fuck is this gonna be over so you could just like wander around 
[00:45:00]  and do all sorts of shit yeah i didn't do that that was that was mostly kids in that area i think  right playing video games well then we had a kid area oh i didn't see the video game area so the  freaking parents didn't have to deal with their screaming kids that's where i hung out  with babysitters yes that was probably overall the best wedding i had ever been to i just try to  make it a little different that's all yeah yeah you got to shake things up a little bit yeah and  then the then the cheesesteaks did you make it to the cheesesteaks no i didn't i was doing i ate so  much because then the band cleared out and then we had we had an after party you didn't have to stay 
[00:45:30]  for it then we had a dj with an after party and then they brought out the like the greasy  cheesesteaks and shit no i wish i would have known oh my god it went forever uh that's what  made it different george you fuck why is george a fuck was he saying what made it different or is  he saying something that's his name well i was trying i was trying to give the the youngsters out  there a little advice to just try to make your wedding a little different then he's like well  what made your wedding different tell me now i want to get divorced i don't know how it goes from 
[00:46:00]  trying to help people out there to you know this guy being a dick i was actually trying to help  people because seriously your your wedding is going to be a bore for most people and i'm sure  even my wedding was a bore for for you know a bunch of people because they've seen it all so you try  to just do something different that makes it exciting i'm gonna go the opposite route i'm like  you know what fuck everybody i'm gonna have a very heavily religious wedding with with just a 
[00:46:30]  ceremony that if the church lasts for two hours yeah we're just sitting there a lot of kneeling  sitting getting up that there is nothing worse than when you first go to the church knowing knowing  you're gonna be there for so fucking long when it says on the full mass it says full mass not the uh  the mini version it's full mass full mass weddings suck everyone is gonna suffer and the reception is  gonna be one with religious fervor i want the reception to have a religious theme to it uh 
[00:47:00]  there's not gonna be a whole lot of dancing it's gonna be a somber quiet event if naked john lock  thinks he's staying on pal talk he's got another thing coming great uh goodbye sir you don't want  you're bounced let's see uh remember the christmas wedding i went to anthony christmas eve someone's  going to trump that story jim in north carolina jim hey how you guys doing good brother uh yeah i work 
[00:47:30]  for a burial vault company and uh wintertime's our busy season november to april you can hire and fire by  and we only try to close on christmas day that's the only day we're actually closed every year  so christmas eve and the day after christmas is killer with funerals you went to a christmas eve  funeral well i worked the christmas eve funeral oh you worked it all the time is that something  that like um you could put the body you could put it off you could put the body on ice put it on ice 
[00:48:00]  unless you're uh a jew yeah yeah they gotta get him in the ground they gotta get him in the ground  and then they gotta sit shiva right i remember that yeah you know it's sort of crazy you know  because the winter time's on especially this last year was terrible the jews have to plan  immediately you gotta get the planting done joan river's talking about when she sat shiva for edgar  edgar she was crying and there i was sitting shiva for edgar i was sitting shiva 
[00:48:30]  they sit on a box and you gotta just sit there i don't know why the jewish religion is like about  you just gotta sit you got everything with the jewish religion is be miserable and uncomfortable  the only good thing is though it's like if if you are having to go to a shiv or you're you're hosting  one it's basically just people bringing over food and bottles of wine so it's actually not that bad  it's kind of like a week of just can you sit in a chair it's almost partying almost in a way in a  weird way don't you have to sit on like a box maybe if you're like super religious yeah yeah i 
[00:49:00]  don't i never heard of that but it's usually just friends and family bringing over big platters of  cookies and well that's like what what catholic funerals are like that too like uh but it's just  one day that you plant the guy you have the wake you know and then you plant the guy and then back  to someone's house for a lot of food and then you're just talking but before you know it you're  you're drinking and just laughing it's like oh now it's like uh thanksgiving or christmas or  something with the dead guy yeah yeah but the uncle's gone where is it i just just make believe 
[00:49:30]  he's in the caribbean that's right we just planted oh that's why we're here fuck yeah yeah he went  on vacation oh that's why we're here if you go into that one room of the house you'll know why we're  here you're walking back to the car from the cemetery and the the creep grave digger guys are  starting to turn those cranks to get the casket in the ground it's always one creepy there's always  one party pooper usually it's usually it's the wife of the deceased if you could get her out of 
[00:50:00]  the house it's a hell of a party for everybody yeah if you could kind of get her mood up right  so she's not wailing and screaming throughout your party right it's a good time because if you think  about it it really is it turns into a really good party most families don't do the right thing get  her in a bedroom somewhere just get her get her get her away from the happiness because we're now  telling really good stories because we haven't seen each other in a while right we're all together  now having fun but you feel guilty because you're having so much fun uh i'm being told that uh only 
[00:50:30]  the hasidics are really the um the ones about misery and everything like that but i don't know  a lot of uh jewish uh religious occasions are all kind of wrapped around this this it's celebration but  it's uh thinly veiled suffering there's a lot of suffering going on and sacrifice and  you know leaven that bread right why puffy bread is good bitter herbs why why bitter i don't get it 
[00:51:00]  enjoy enjoy yourself yeast costs money that's steve from bay shore kevin and our favorite anti-semit  he goes because yeast costs money unleavened bread do you know what a canter is and do you i've heard  the the word they like sing whatever maybe somebody jewish can explain what it kind of like the  they kind of like sing the torah because like there there is like a torah torah torah no that's 
[00:51:30]  modi the comedian is apparently a canter yeah i thought it was a goof and he went up in a full jewish man  regalia is this getting you excited your hand my balls your hand is firmly planted down your  right right now i'm giving the old my balls are an irish center and i'm giving them the old shook  a shook on the side but him and charade went up and did like it was a goof thing where modi would  fucking uh would canter and then you know charade would read the interpretation of what it meant it 
[00:52:00]  was funny but he's actually really fucking good man i never saw that done before no idea i've never seen  it or or heard it it was fucking really cool to watch we just don't know a lot about the jews we  don't know a lot about anybody else's like business the religion their fucking their their cultural  backgrounds i just i don't like anything that doesn't involve me they're very musical their  weddings choose i think they're very musical uh yeah yeah they're not boring receptions they're 
[00:52:30]  fun when you saw and i saw andrew dice clay up on that chair of the pictures of his wedding  where they put him up on the chair i'm up on the chair that's right look finally after all these  years i'm a jew hava nagila hava nagila oh i'm in the chair don't don't drop me how many guys  how many guys how to lift them how many guys how to lift them depends on what year yeah jesus

[00:57:30]  black people dancing to slayer that's the great part of it martian there's a few white guys in there  who are even worse dancers oh yeah when white people get hit with the spirit they're even worse  oh hell yeah they're on the floor like doing the the worm spinning around in circles jumping  that's crazy that's crazy people they're crazy people but can i say how much i love bob kelly's  wife she does a thing which really humiliates bob and i don't mean just shows him his act 
[00:58:00]  she does something called checking for nickels okay what is this what is this because sometimes  chip will dance and humiliate my girlfriend and he was doing a few moves last night just  and bob was like ah really uncomfortable watching chip dance yes at a wedding monday night wedding but  then his wife did what was checking for nickels which is i don't know exactly how she does it but 
[00:58:30]  it's got something to do with uh her feet kind of like moving but her arms are straight and  it's fucking i can't do it justice only bob can explain it but it's terrible it's a dance though it's  almost like an irish ah like a step dance kind of it's fucking great it bob ran away she did it and  me and my girlfriend is it rolling checking check i think that's what she called it whatever whatever  it was checking it was a good it's a cool thing just do and wow she made bob so 
[00:59:00]  fucking uncomfortable he didn't want to watch dude he physically ran away i'm not saying i'm not saying  that like metaphorically he ran away physically it made him so uncomfortable and then he promptly  almost stepped in a pile of dog shit i would say the size of a beanbag chair outside he missed it by  maybe an eighth of an inch oh that would have been fantastic i almost saw his dumb dress shoes  slipping a dog shit he would have fell backwards right onto it he would have fell right into it 
[00:59:30]  like a slippery banana our banana peel is really that slippery let's let's let's get into that a  little bit depends on the surface they're on i get the fuck out of here but everywhere in cartoons  they're slippery yeah old wise uh tale let's say but cement not not so bad so much like a school  hallway floor oh you're you're going with the banana peel yeah get out of here let's try it out  with fatso smooth all right geez one of two yeah let's say um 
[01:00:00]  we should take a break yeah i want to eat i want to eat i don't even know my oatmeal is cold  yeah i know a bunch of fun stuff i need i didn't eat my cereal cereal yet so what do you are you just  nice to the baby for the rest of the day after like that you just kind of give it like extra kisses  and stuff yeah he tried to like i don't know it was sad crank up the mobile  baby music but then brought it right uh brought it together welcome to life son yeah there you go 
[01:00:30]  the options are worse i'm getting polio yeah no kidding exactly but i'll say it again i'll summarize  fucking 2010 let's figure out an easier way to do this i guess that's the easiest way still and  no flying cars with nothing still the easiest way is to stab a needle into your seven and a half week  old's uh chubby thighs seems to be the only way to get stuff into our veins these days unbelievable  you'd think there'd be some kind of osmosis thing they'd have an osmosis machine yeah but no oh man 
[01:01:00]  but the nurse with the fucking chin hair you don't want that get a piece of duct tape and smack it  with it and just rip it out rip it out go there i did it what would you have done if like only when  you were along with your son if like when you're holding him you're like there there if he just went  what the fuck was that oh my god oh my god but never did it again right and no one would believe you 
[01:01:30]  no one would believe you you know what he just did and you're telling everybody that he cursed  and they're like no he didn't right and then he didn't say anything and then finally you're  along with him and he went you're a fucking rat  that would be a great plot for a fucking horror movie there's no one buying into it  all right opian anthony and now picking up where they left off the opian anthony show continues 
[01:02:00]  looking around there's just not much in the news today man no huh we got russian spies yeah i don't  really know what that's about though i i know the russian spies are really hot or the one they showed 
[01:02:30]  was really hot one of them uh she was using a little facebook magic um oh really yeah a little  voodoo she looked a little more haggard uh than she looks in her uh facebook i think she had a  facebook or a myspace and they pulled her picture from there and she looked pretty good she doesn't  look bad i mean they got her they got her on the cover of the paper she's some uh russian chick  red-headed russian yeah fiery fiery red red uh reds ten reds actually yeah the russians uh busted 
[01:03:00]  there in new york they were uh not like the cold war days they were going after like economic  information and foreign policy information uh more so than you know weaponry and things like that they  used to uh want to spy on us for a whole new world you know so uh they were doing that but they were  living in some town and uh and boy did they pick a town of dummies they were showing the people their 
[01:03:30]  neighbors and they're just like i never knew they just seem like nice people just dunces and uh  they finally caught him there uh they intercepted a communique between moscow and these people that  spelled everything out oh really that's a dumb fucking thing to have sent spies but they were hanging out  at a starbucks and under the globe near columbus circle yeah they just you know and what were they  doing do they have like uh trench coats on yeah no no trench coat the old school spies yeah she's 
[01:04:00]  wearing a nice dress yeah yeah she's looking all hot in this picture look at that shit well hot and  shit that look good and um yeah they just uh they caught him busted him it's old school stuff though  you know russian spies and it was a pretty big operation they had uh russian spies all over the place  sounds kind of cool though right yeah still sounds kind of cool ruski spies i'm sure uh yeah there's 
[01:04:30]  gonna be a little problem when when we have a little discussion with uh russia oh no obama obama's  actually probably going to apologize for um having inconvenience the poor spies being here in america they  should have been treated as american citizens and what so you're saying you don't like obama  well well i've said that enough over the uh past a couple of years but i'm just saying you know  how about showing some balls i i you know and of course it was it was sean hannity i was watching 
[01:05:00]  last night but uh the information gets out there and he had the great american panel and there was  uh a couple of liberals on there and stuff so you get to hear the other side uh why is  why are there uh ships that we could be using to help clean up this oil just not being used  you mean the military yeah i don't know uh i'll tell you why because i found out last night 
[01:05:30]  apparently wait because hannity told you or did you do your own research or uh hannity told me and  then i went on the internet and looked up what the law was you did look it up yeah there's there's a um  there's sort of this act you know like a an act um where you can't just say all right we got this  giant ship it's in norfolk virginia right now and it's an oil skimmer it's made to fucking drive around  and clean up the fucking oil and it's sitting there because uh there is some kind of an act where 
[01:06:00]  non-union labor cannot be brought in and and do this job uh this cleaning up job and the unions  are the ones that support the shit out of obama and he doesn't want to piss them off even in this  emergency situation by uh having this ship coming the jones act right is that what it's called so wait  is this a fucking union issue yeah yeah yeah it's it's a union issue it's an obama wants his votes 
[01:06:30]  issue um so instead of cleaning this shit up and doing what they got to do it's still just bp and you  know the coast guards out there but for the most part there are so many resources other countries that  want to come in and help meanwhile you know it it's another country spill so it's fucking british  petroleum we're allowing them to do it japan owns part of that fucking rig and all kinds of 
[01:07:00]  shit how about these 16 or so countries that want to come in and help clean up the gulf we allow them  to come in and do it yeah why not we help them so if it's a union issue can't you get the unions to  clean up the oil no they don't have the equipment they don't have this military ship they don't have  that equipment all right so i'm just trying to break it down so okay it's a union issue but the  the unions don't have the equipment to clean up the oil so isn't there a way to go look you don't  have the equipment so we're gonna we have to get this cleaned up what you do is you repeal or suspend 
[01:07:30]  the jones act yeah right and let the fucking military go in with these ships and clean the  fucking stuff up let the military do it or you allow it's an emergency or you just do it and if and  then then you look if the unions really complain or sue then you allow these unions to be fucking  you put them up in public and say these these guys are suing yeah and and you and you allow the public 
[01:08:00]  right outrage to to to shame them wow you got the phone that's but again is that wrong is there  something missing there because that's fucking what an indictment on unions if that if that's all it  is it's sad it's also known as jones act deals with uh cabotage coastal shipping requires that all  good transportation uh goods transported by water between u.s ports and uh be carried in u.s flag  ships constructed in the united states owned by u.s citizens and crewed by u.s citizens and u.s 
[01:08:30]  permanent residents that's the purpose of the law is to support the u.s merchant marine industry  but agricultural interests see it's the ship we have but it's it's registered in another country  um but it's in virginia right now just just use the fucking ship but is that really what's stopping  obama from like do you think obama said or anybody said look let's use that ship and someone went did  jones act like if we're going fuck the jones act i don't see obama allowing his fucking right now his 
[01:09:00]  his name is being he's really getting a beating for this i don't see any president allowing the jones act  well to fuck it again if it's that simple he's getting a beating but not as much of a beating as  he'll get from his constituency here's the deal um uh he's not he doesn't really seem to have this on  the front burner he just doesn't this is a it this is a catastrophe happening off the the coast uh it's 
[01:09:30]  hitting beaches it's now in mississippi and it's just it's destroying a lot of uh beach and wetlands  do something and the oil skimmers just sitting there well there are plenty of dumb country vessels  that could be used and we got the chief engineer in the merchant marine all right wants to set the  record straight about the jones act let's say hi to raymond in virginia beach raymond 
[01:10:00]  hey guys good morning good morning raymond help us out it's not a union issue okay the jones act  require uh pertains to shipping that's done inside the united states territorial waters  this vessel is foreign flagged it's going to gather up the oil that's spilled and then it's going to sell  it at a profit by the the constraints of the jones act any type of activity like that that occurs  inside territorial waters has to be done by a u.s flagged vessel yeah exactly but who gives a 
[01:10:30]  shit at this point if they scoop it up and sell it let them fucking scoop it up and sell it get it  the fuck out of the gulf absolutely our uh extinguished president there could just  fucking with a stroke of the pen turn around and say that i waived the requirement to the jones act  for the purpose of yada yada yada and we're done yeah who's who owns the ship it's a foreign  flat company but it's no big no big deal they can write a letter of exclusion this one event and off we 
[01:11:00]  go but what happens if they scoop it up they get to keep it yes and then they sell it as waste oil and  and make you know oh let them well then why don't we do the right it's kind of waste oil right now  yeah yeah really it's how much money can we get for it on the beach how much money  oh damn yeah ring out a fucking pelican right how much money can we  you know a union member i just want to straighten it out okay 
[01:11:30]  it's a law thing unfortunately but the idiots in office with a stroke of the pen can fix it  once again the dumb americans we are a dumb country once again we get to blame bush tell  him jeff tell him tell him yeah uh bush suspended the jones act here in katrina  yeah the reason that he did it was because he wasn't beholden to the unions and that guy that  was on the phone before uh it used to be the jones act was about espionage you know we didn't  want foreign flags exactly right off the coast but it is turned into a union that's why i said that 
[01:12:00]  it's like it's just what you said like the written letter of the law or the act the way it's worded  doesn't mention unions but it's all about unions it's about fucking unions exactly and uh yeah jimmy  jimmy and you were saying well then why don't people why don't aren't people up in arms about  this and all this shit right this is precisely the reason that this shows perfect example jay you don't 
[01:12:30]  you didn't know about it and you're pretty damn well informed think how many other people don't  know about this shit and if they knew about it there'd be a revolution no tom's got to be talked  to all right after yeah all right uh i mean obama should do something and then if the unions then  people become aware if the union actually made up would have to make a court issue out of it or  whatever yeah then then i'm saying the public uh flagellation by the public all right let me thank  you jeff we got to go to tom in uh pennsylvania tom go ahead if tom isn't joking i swear  he is the biggest douche but i'll preface your call that way go ahead tom yeah thanks anthony 
[01:13:00]  listen i mean obviously we're still pumping millions and millions of gallons of oil into  the gulf every single day if he was out there cleaning this stuff up while it was still pumping  you'd be breaking his balls that he's a fucking idiot because he's trying to clean up something  that's not what would i so what you're saying is if let's say a pipe breaks in your house  until the plumber comes and cleans it up you don't grab a mop and try to sop it up and put it in a 
[01:13:30]  bucket and get it out of your house is that what you're saying you wait until the plumber you just  sit there and watch your kitchen fill up with water is that what you're saying i'm fucking smart enough to  shut the fucking water off i'm saying you can't shut the water off and that's what that's what you're  you're saying you're saying they should that that i'm a reput you said i'm a republican dick  they're waiting to get the oil turned off before they clean it up how about when it approaches the  beach they fucking start cleaning it up oh look at this anthony and hannity are full of 
[01:14:00]  shit fucking idiot jones act has nothing to do with this yes it does tom i will say so far  so you bill broderick so far your call is not good dude you're not you don't have any point other  than the fact that you probably just don't like ant on hannity or hannity but uh you have no point  yeah okay  terrible okay so wait 70 days you you were listened to you were heard and listened to you  and respond we all listened to you and your point was horrendous it's 71 days they're waiting now to 
[01:14:30]  shut this fucking thing off uh i think you could start cleaning up i know they don't know how to shut  it off so so we all know so don't clean it up when it approaches the beaches don't get a skimmer out  there jeez every fucking asset that bp has and why should we be paying for this shit these  fuckers are professional how about it goes it transcends right like you always fucking do you  dickhead oh how about right now it transcends uh the cost and bp's responsibility and it is what is 
[01:15:00]  in essence um an invasion of our shores by goopy uh army how about we clean it up with the military  and then send bp the bill yeah there you go but guys who's turning the fucking thing off well however  they do it they'll eventually figure it out we don't know what the point is just clean it up as it's in  the ocean there's no like yeah brilliant point by ann of course you don't let your fucking kitchen  fill up before you just start mopping it and mopping it so that the damage doesn't accrue right do what 
[01:15:30]  you can right you got all right all right thank you we're gonna move on that was an awful awful  point eddie in st louis who usually talk sports anthony eddie anthony you know i have the utmost  respect for you i think you're a funny guy and uh you're very talented no he's not but that being  said i've got documents right here that completely uh fly in the face of what fox news and you've been  saying what do you have i have uh statements from the uh uh uh the press secretary mr gibbs saying 
[01:16:00]  that uh quote we're using equipment and vessels from countries like norway canada and the netherlands  there's not been any problem with this if there's any need for any type of waiver that would obviously  be granted statements from the acting maritime administrator saying quote 23 of the vessels  responding to the oil spill are not u.s flag and they are not in violation of the jones act  oh that's coming from the white house press secretary huh well yeah but there's uh and  then i've also got ones from guys who are uh you know supposedly not political national incident 
[01:16:30]  commander administrator uh thad allen i mean excuse me admiral uh june 18th document saying that there  are 15 foreign flag vessels involved in the response so why aren't we seeing this i have not seen  well you're not in the gulf uh yeah well how about they show the news and they can show greasy pelicans  every day how about i see a fucking norwegian flag a norwegian flag ship maybe a norwegian cruise ship  could help out everything i see is some fucking thing that looks like quince boat the orca with 
[01:17:00]  with a couple of bumpers on it a couple guys from new orleans i want to see big fucking ships  sucking up oil with big fucking flags that you don't even know what country exactly with guns on  him for some reason shoot the oil any comment uh i mean like i said i mean if you uh did the  washington post wrote an editorial about all the washington post a couple of days ago and i mean  they were ripping obama a new asshole yeah even they had to state in there that uh it did the jones 
[01:17:30]  act has had no official impact on this i mean you know i'm i can understand if you want to bash on  the unions but uh it looks to me like just you know i've read a bunch of shit on this stuff you know  there's other stuff besides sports that i'm into and it really doesn't seem like an issue to me  i know mccain introduced legislation trying to repeal the act but uh you know i honestly think  that's uh to do more with his uh quote-unquote free market interpretation how come it seems that  the american people um really in in great numbers are are kind of looking at this like nothing uh is 
[01:18:00]  really being done and not enough not nothing but not enough is being done by the powers that be to  get all kinds of shit in there to fucking solve this problem and i'm glad you asked me that question  because i've always considered myself a staunch democrat and i mean i voted for carry and i i  held my nose doing it and i voted for obama boom stole jimmy's bed i had a feeling when i voted for obama  that like i don't know maybe i was uh under a spell or something i just thought that he was going to be 
[01:18:30]  different i thought he represented another track of politics and so far it's been you know meet the  the new boss same as the old boss and it makes me not even want to just a little oh now i will say  this if i lived to be 500 years old i'm glad i didn't vote for that bitch palin because she scares  the hell out of me i agree with you for her no i agree she's an idiot i think if you ask me  her campaign rhetoric she was trying to get obama lynched i honestly no dude honestly she's just  she's not a threat she's just a dummy she's a conservative lady yeah that's all palin is she's 
[01:19:00]  a fucking conservative lady cooking brownies for a fucking uh kids boy scout troop or something  she's not evil she's just a conservative lady who was fucking thrown into a national spotlight  she never should have been on that level she probably did a nice job as governor she was not  vetted properly it was a terrible campaign spotlight then she's still in that fucking spotlight  she's selling books yeah it's unbelievable she's fucking on fox news she's selling books she's just 
[01:19:30]  she's an she's a dummy i hope you answer your ultra conservative dummy why i think she's in that  spotlight and i think democrats unwittingly make her so much more important than she is and and by  accident by attacking her so harshly they force people who kind of agree with her ideology to rally  around her because they feel like she's getting the shit kicked out of yep there you go hey eddie  yo screw all this politic thing uh lebron james we got a couple days left where is he going  okay well basically i still think that the best shot for a title is for him to go to chicago because 
[01:20:00]  i mean look at it they got noah they got rose you stick lebron and they're all you need to do is add  a tall guy to it but why why would you want to like following uh jordan's footsteps there you know  come on i mean uh he wouldn't be considered the greatest chicago bull of all time well i mean he  would if he wins more than six or seven rings he's not gonna win six or seven he's they've been  talking yes hey the smartest thing to do is go to the eastern conference because if you've got  to go through the lakers you're probably fucked i mean the suns had a fantastic team last year but  i mean even they you know got destroyed but there's been a lot of talk about the lebron going to the 
[01:20:30]  heat and uh going with uh dwayne wade and then maybe getting chris bosh but i still think the  lakers are going to make that's the headline today anthony lebron goes to miami they're thinking  oh is that the headline well no i mean not that i thought it was something like i'm sorry  the supreme court said that uh you know people are thinking amendment includes all states and  cities people are talking and saying that it's that there's a good shot he's going to end up in  miami which is yeah not good news for the knicks i thought he was uh saying he was just going to 
[01:21:00]  stay in cleveland he ain't staying in cleveland is he eddie the knicks is completely helpless i mean  you know my family's originally from the bronx so i'm you know like i'm a jets fan and a knicks fan and  it's just oh knicks it's very tough you know because it seems like they made a lot of moves  it's fucking endless it all goes back to that it's a flow chart right it really is 
[01:21:30]  no matter where it starts that's where it ends up yeah it floats like it's a river or something you  know uh chip cuckoo i i just to finish up with uh eddie lebron james if he goes to the knicks he's  got away what a bunch of years before the team has a shot at going to the fucking finals well like  i said they freed up a lot of cap space so i think we'll go out and make some big acquisitions but the  wild card was that russian billionaire who was trying to buy the nets i don't know what happened  with him but look caught for spying he's gonna go to miami imagine or he's gonna go to probably uh 
[01:22:00]  chicago but i think the main thing is i don't think he's gonna go to miami because no matter  what he talks about wanting to be on you know a quote-unquote super team i still think he wants  to be king cock on that team i think he has a big ego and that's what it's all about i mean you know  people are talking about he could stay in cleveland but honestly i think he just likes to see his name  on the tv all right good job brother thanks thanks eddie i like that eddie in st louis he's a  shit and someone is knocking down your plumbing theory anthony i'm sorry really yes they are how 
[01:22:30]  is that greg brady's leftovers wisconsin when you have a fucking bullet hole in your chest and  you're bleeding all over the place do you start cleaning up the blood before the bullet hole is  sewn up that's different shut up yeah because you know how to sew the bullet hole up stupid  why is it stupid that's like it's just as good as your plumbing and by the way you do take something  and and put a compress on it so so you plug you can plug that hole up 
[01:23:00]  jeez what an ass why is that stupid but your plumbing thing is logical plumbing thing it makes  sense because it's not you're not dying during the plumbing thing well the gulf is dying well  that's the gulf it's not you you're the one that's got to clean it up cleaning up yeah i'm trying to  think which one i like best the gulf is the fucking water in your in your i like the gunshot one better  gulf's your kitchen okay broken pipe is the oil okay your mop is the fucking ships that should be 
[01:23:30]  out there cleaning up okay that's it what about the bullet hole the bullet hole who what's the gulf  um you you're the gulf mm-hmm see but then you're being injured you're not being injured very injured  very very very i have a bullet hole and it hurts me very much knocked my shoes off and my glasses  uh it's you all right why don't we it's a u.s ship should be working regardless of the jones act 
[01:24:00]  it's foreign flagship jim and ann are woman haters palin better than obama knows how to  run i'm a woman how am i a woman hater i just kind of defended let's go to dan in tennessee  dan hey fellas hey come on let's be serious i mean obama you're gay aren't you hold on no this  is dan why don't you know these guys how do i know callers dan you and dan go at it all the time and  and he's going to be like oh anthony why would you say how am i a woman hater dan yeah you know 
[01:24:30]  congratulations to you opie i haven't talked talked to you in a while thank you related um i i just think  it's just so obvious that when it comes down to palin it's like this thing kicks in with y'all to  trash her just like the media does but when you when you really think about it in terms of common sense  government which is really what we need i guarantee it i mean you can say what you want to about the  girl but we do apparently we can't you're getting mad but you can't back it up with logic because 
[01:25:00]  she has actual experience in running government and and and the best presidents turn out to be like  ex-governors because they have to balance a budget they i guarantee you she with this oil spill  she would have been all over it she would have probably at least called some experts and got  together and said look we need to figure out how to stop this hope bp you've got two or three days if  you don't do it we're coming in and i've got wouldn't sound like that it'd be bp you have two days 
[01:25:30]  and you better clean this it's just she doesn't sound presidential she's got she's got energy  experience dan how how how does that's a vagina dan i want to know how that makes me a woman hater i  actually just said that palin is not what people say she is so how does that uh well you were putting  her down because oh she's on the national stage you know i don't think she's qualified dan i don't  think she's qualified but don't allow your arrogance hold on dan no experience in government 
[01:26:00]  don't allow your arrogance to think that you're the only one who's who's who's made an informed  decision i've seen her speak enough and i haven't attacked her like the cornball media has and i don't  attack her like other comics do but after having watched her for this amount of time i don't want  her running the country well i i do because we're good for you i'm glad she has the values conservative  values i don't like her that's what this country was always ran abortions country it's been a center 
[01:26:30]  to the right country because look come on let's just be honest about it the president the president  has no experience at running do you think because we wait wait but do you think because we don't think  palin is qualified to be president that all of a sudden we're thinking obama is or is a good  president you're you're making it a one or the other thing i don't like either of them and i  wouldn't want either of them in the white house unfortunately we have one in there uh i i i don't 
[01:27:00]  i don't want her running and fucking up a republican ticket well we're glad you feel that way good  welcome to another democrat welcome to another democratic president if she's the  fucking ticket with the ability to welcome to another democratic four years if she is on that  ticket welcome to four more years of a democrat president i don't have conservative values hold on  dan i don't have conservative values that's your life so don't act like don't act no no don't act 
[01:27:30]  like you're this guy who loves women and we hate women you keep babbling we're just going to turn you  down you're not having a conversation now no one can hear you so you can babble to yourself  i don't have conservative values so i'm not looking for someone who's against abortion i don't that's  who you want values yeah my stupid president i didn't hear a word you just said so keep talking  to yourself like you're doing the car rambling dude you're not going back and forth you're being  an attention whore you're like rambling this is my job you're calling my job wait i'm an attention 
[01:28:00]  whore you're calling my job  fuck your conservative values you cornball conservative i'm an attention whore i'm working  values of running government not i'm not talking about abortion i'm not talking well we are that's  to me not what i want in the white house wow for somebody with conservative values you use dirty  liberal language so what what what when you can't run a government give me a conservative 
[01:28:30]  value that has to do with the government then like you said it means to have a balanced budget  okay it means it means to run it means like lower taxes pro business it's not conservative  fiscally conservative i like i like fiscally conservative i don't like but but it goes hand  in hand with this morality fucking church bullshit you got a problem with loving yeah because you know 
[01:29:00]  what sometimes the best president likes a little pussy now and then oh you know what and and this  that's what we're talking about and this whole this whole conservative because you can't be fiscally  conservative without also being this more moral fucking bullshit artist where where they're they're  they're trying to get rid of sex on the internet but meanwhile they're jerking off in their own  closets they're fucking tripping over their own cocks what they're molesting children  yeah you fucking all kinds of shit just shut up with your records every one of your 
[01:29:30]  fucking conservative moralists has been taking dick in their mouth yeah every one of the guys  thou protestest too much is that what it is anthony yes every one of these corn balls against gay  marriage and knocking gays with their conservatives has been fucking sucking dick really well that's  funny because obama doesn't believe in uh and uh gay marriage either uh why do you why do you hit  us with obama like we like him yeah exactly have you listened to this show dummy have you listened 
[01:30:00]  to this you called up now dan you called up and said y'all are woman haters and you are you you're  always trash and pale and i think it's because she doesn't have a dick once again don't be it don't  be it why are you saying woman hater i think i think but you're wrong so you like strong strong  women who have actual value okay stop saying value wait let me let me let me let me jump in dan  sure uh freak let me jump in dan uh jim norton was just saying the other day he wouldn't mind seeing 
[01:30:30]  hillary make a run for the fucking white house so speaking of women hating uh jimmy made that point  only a few days ago which made anthony go yeah what do you think what do you think of hillary clinton  dan as a president oh he hates her hates her she's way too liberal to me oh but she's a strong  woman she has experience in government what are you talking about having experience at running  anything oh my god come on she's been a senator in new york it's been uh she's been uh involved 
[01:31:00]  with politics her whole life now you're a man to the president you're just a woman hater  although that's using the term loosely with hillary what i said you're a fat ankle hater  you don't like frumps what i said the other day dan since you're not going to go back and forth  we'll just talk and turn you down what i said the other day was that i used to hate hillary clinton  and i really turned around on her like i don't love her now but i like her more than obama and i would 
[01:31:30]  trust her handling of the middle east and stuff more than i trust no one can hear a word you say  since you're not going to talk you can be the same way you are with your fucking wife  where you babble at her and she nods oh good point dan good point dan you're not going to do that  here you can go back and forth or you could just get turned down and babble in your stupid voice  and talk about value i'm a man who likes conservative values you don't like women  i'm a pea brain don't i'm going to pull out the harsh insults 
[01:32:00]  i didn't say a fucking word about moral values i'm talking about moral ways the bottom line was this  you called up just admit that you don't know what you're talking about for the record i love  this you called up and said you don't know what you're talking about you said we don't like women  because that's your argument is such that you said we don't like women when i think i think it's  because she actually has morals she has she's a common sense strong you say that okay dan and you've  been heard you've been heard yes she was really able to get those moral values into her family 
[01:32:30]  where her daughter uh exactly pregnant out of wedlock exactly what happened to her daughter  getting pregnant out of wedlock she's really able to get that morality uh um really across to her  family right what happened there what happened there what happened there what happened there what  happened there what happened there what happened there you're right what happened there what happened  there what happened there pregnant out of wedlock pregnant out of wedlock pregnant out of wedlock 
[01:33:00]  what are we in fourth this guy dan is just one of these conservative jerk-offs who can't handle  when somebody else makes a point values got the conservative values he just said anthony just said  what happened to her conservative her great values when she couldn't even run it in her own family  and her daughter got knocked up out of wedlock what happened to that you can't blame a parent  what what she's she's the moral fucking cornerstone of the family oh my god and she's got this great  morality that she's going to bring to the entire country she can't bring it to her daughter you can't 
[01:33:30]  me you can't blame the parent any points that's just dumb ass yeah yeah that's dumb stop talking to  yourself haha gotcha she's got i don't like a woman with values values i'll occasionally smack one when  i'm drunk intelligent conversation now now you're acting like a a beaver either take back what you  said about us not liking women then take that back it was it was incorrect just as god made me sir 
[01:34:00]  just admit you were wrong women make it skeptical i don't care if it's skeptical your interpretation of  it is wrong you said jimmy and anthony i'm threatened i'm threatened by strong women you  kind of are you let her run around with little horrors that that you can like manipulate oh  shit i think he's got me on this one all right all right you got me on that one you are an uninformed

[01:56:00]  psycho oh and a fans come on i don't care who buys them is that really come on this literary giant  douchebag have you now which which book have you read which book have you read huh which books have  you read which of my books have you read uh the first one that you came out with okay so you not  even think about buying another one yeah i don't believe you you're gonna tell me you didn't think  that book was funny you're lying you're lying it was okay but it wasn't it you know it's kind of like  are you going to write a book about being funny are you going to try and write a book about a 
[01:56:30]  biography or it's which is it one or the other it's like okay you know it's a funny book you're  lying dude you know you're lying i think you ought to just you know quit trying to act like you're a  literary giant and just stick to comedy do a cd or something you know i actually have it's thanks for  the plug dan i have a cd on itunes two of them actually the one thing about hunting that was  probably like george carlin like material like on the hunting you know thing where hunting is not a  sport no fishing is not a sport yes that's like that was like so funny that that should be on a cd

[01:57:30]  how many how many did you sell i hit number 11 on the times bestseller list uh number number 11 on  the new york times bestseller list with my second book because it came out on election day of 2008  number four on the bestseller list for the first book i mean how many copies i have no i honestly have  no idea i have no idea how the book world works see that kind of determines a little bit uh no i  think the best sell bestseller list yeah stop yeah you can't really argue that my friend you know that  the books were very successful and he knows that very successful well i know you know a lot of people 
[01:58:00]  buy them out of loyalty you know probably their motives don't dan their motives are irrelevant  their motives are irrelevant the fact is that you can't do this when you're pinned in an argument on  something you can't just keep trying to find another shitty angle don't try to be an author  well i've written two bestsellers how many copies well i don't know how the book world works i honestly  have never asked i just know where they were on the list and following your logic i mean a lot of  people bought palance uh books because they were just fans right yeah well yeah i mean yeah i mean 
[01:58:30]  i don't i just don't what are you talking about why are you talking about books anyway yeah that's way out  of your league exactly you wouldn't know one if you saw one and i actually don't consider myself  what are you using to chalk up your tires like my whole life you just like the bottom line is  this i wrote a book and you went out and bought it good thanks tick tock i'm just out of loyalty  regardless and they're not going to be honest with you really the fans aren't going to be honest 
[01:59:00]  are you fucking nuts ten dollars and ninety five cents i don't think they're going to be honest with  you no of course you know just get away from the book selling and stick with a comedy like like cd or  why don't you put the phone down and pick up a tire pressure gauge  you bought one i'm pretty sure you probably bought the second one but i'm glad you enjoyed the first  one well you may have had problems with it it was very sexually open and uh maybe a little jealous  that i fucking went out and did a lot of dirty things i was okay talking about it  there's nothing about you and anthony i can assure you that i would ever be jealous you're just 
[01:59:30]  obsessed about jill nicolini you're lying you're fucking lying you would have liked  you would have liked jill right you're perverted twisted little dork you would have liked jill right  right on the show one you wouldn't like jill right you called you said jill is a attractive and uh  a strong woman so you would have liked uh you would have liked uh jill right yeah yeah yeah  i fucked her  and you won't admit this is how dumb you are you won't admit that you have a sexual thing for sarah 
[02:00:00]  palin so her appearance actually makes you more connected to her thought about it you're lying  dude you're fucking lying like you guys do and like you're lying you know i don't i don't think  about her like you're lying why did you just mention jill nicolini no one was talking about jill yeah but  you go with anthony's ex you know your your relationships with women therefore thus leading  you down i think this path of kind of of anthony not really having you know a lot of respect or  esteem for sarah palin and her and considering her political views are like pretty much identical 
[02:00:30]  no they're not that only leads me to think that he has problems wow you are way off base well how  about well the fact that you would mention jill the fact could you thank you there you go now you  now you learn to listen this is how we teach someone who just keeps babbling this is how you  were taught when you were a little child you were slapped and now we turn the blame down  this is what would lead me to believe that you have a thing for sarah palin because when talking  about anthony you mentioned jill a strong attractive woman well you're obsessed with sarah palin who's 
[02:01:00]  a strong attractive woman so i'll take your same dog shit logic and that's what would lead me to  believe that you have a thing no one can hear a word you say cunt that's what would lead me to believe  that you like sarah palin not respect for her values not respect for her intellect because you know  she's not really that bright she's not a retard but she's not bright enough to run the country i think  she gets beat up too much by the media i think they attack her because she's an easy target  and i think they they weigh too much attacker and i think that she should i'm sorry was i done talking 
[02:01:30]  again dude this is i'm not an actor in your place i'm a real person i have a real thought process and  i've listened to you babble oh yeah and you haven't been right you know just like ranting on i mean come  on no i've been going back and forth with you trying to i've been going back and forth  exchanging ideas listen you're not exchanging ideas you're trying to get all your points in  because you know you see exactly there you go criticize me you were doing the same thing when  we started we listened to your start you made an accusation i went to address the accusation as 
[02:02:00]  incorrect and you just right there you just go you started babbling over that's what you do dan  you're wrong in your interpretation all right all right you said that many times  dan now you got to deal with texas richard in texas another trucker you got the truckers fired up go  ahead richard i just want to say i haven't been doing this very long but i've noticed there's  three types of truckers out there there's old road dogs the guys have been doing it forever they're  easy going great people there's the young guys like me don't know what the hell we're doing look

[02:17:30]  fucking he gets a lot laid the  bullshit no guy driving alone isn't attacking anthony out of jealousy it's  just not happening that's where he's not that's where he's not being honest  and i never play the jealousy card i i would never say oh you're just  yeah because that's like almost a cop-out uh in an argument uh but just the way he  was describing things it's like i go home and i i strap a gun on and i'm alone in my house  you know what i love doing that i got i could 
[02:18:00]  fucking watch great movies just sit there  sip a little wine and then people just come over  that's fine too that's fine and yeah whatever fine and dandy and you know what else he doesn't  believe this is what this is what bothers me about dan not his views or the fact that he's  passionate this is the dishonest part this is the i'm going to be compelling  caller title guy they don't like women that's why well that call will get through and it works it does get  through yes but that's so then what he has to do is try to prove that we don't like 
[02:18:30]  women because he said something conversation starting and controversial but that's where the  bullshit is you don't believe that dan and you know you don't believe that um i don't know man  i'm telling you he doesn't a lot of conservatives out there that believe that shit he's uh no  conservative which makes it really strange no conservative stands on the you don't like women  platform that's what the liberals say to the conservatives you guys don't like women that's  why you don't want them to get abortion that's why you fucking uh you know all that stuff no  conservative says you don't like women when people don't like palin yeah bullshit let's take a break 
[02:19:00]  and we'll continue  yeah that was fun with dan man maybe i shouldn't say that he's such a 
[02:19:30]  rambling ass  here it comes wow wow wow ready wait for it here it comes right now  yeah yeah rock  fuck the white man and his corporate  fucking greed yeah  man hey uh we're gonna have alex jones on the show yes who's alex jones anthony you know anything 
[02:20:00]  about this guy well this guy if i could grab this  do do alex jones has an xm show the alex jones show yes on 165 talk radio um  and um it's the alex jones show yes and uh what he does is um as i read this is big conspiracy 
[02:20:30]  guy yeah rogan likes him a lot a lot of comedians like him uh i don't know if he's a good guy or if  he's a dick but i know he supposedly does good radio and he's a big conspiracy guy  well is joe rogan around today uh did we try to get him he's west coast nice west coast and we'll  just see what my my issue is i just want to actually see what he thinks about certain uh  certain things yeah he's got he's got a lot to say about all kinds of these uh  things things that are going on that people have these uh misconceptions about and and uh 
[02:21:00]  conspiracies he's why he has a film called the obama deception it's a hard-hitting film that  completely destroys the myth that obama's working for the best interests of americans uh the obama  phenomenon is a hoax carefully crafted crafted by the captains of the new world order he's one of  those guys he believes in the new world the illuminati he's gonna be on in about 10 minutes  he's being pushed as savior in an attempt to con the americans into accepting global slavery  we've reached a critical juncture in new world orders plans it's not about left or right it's 
[02:21:30]  about one world government the international banks plan to loot the people of the u.s and  turn them into slaves on the global planet i just it's not that i'm sure he's a smart guy  i'm sure his arguments make sense i just can never buy that stuff yeah it's uh of course he  believes 9-11 is an inside job i don't give a new world conspiracy in which the world leaders  are looking to create one world government with ultimate power i don't give people that much  credit not at all if if that ever happened it would be because that's what we just turned into 
[02:22:00]  you know that whole one world power thing and see conspiracy guys well i'll say this to him too  believing in a conspiracy because you think it has merit makes sense to me but even if i don't  agree with it it makes sense but when you believe in a conspiracy it's almost like when you're a  conspiracy guy your agenda is the conspiracy must be proven so it's like you will kind of ignore facts  that point against it or twist them around to make them fit your agenda 
[02:22:30]  where you'll take teeny weeny innuendos that are seem like facts that that strengthen your cause  and you'll hold them over overwhelming facts in the other direction that's been used by the 9-11  people uh conspiracy guys so much they totally discount facts they take these little  fucking tidbits of rumor and uh speculation and present them as fact and then before you know it  uh people are watching these movies on on on the internet and stuff and going wow that's amazing 
[02:23:00]  it's like no it's made up it's fake that's my problem it's not what they're saying it's the fact  it's their their lack of of common sense in a lot of cases and the way they refuse  to bend when it's something that goes against them they accuse everybody else of having an agenda  gatekeeper but their agenda is that there is a conspiracy happening and nothing is going to  tell no matter what no i don't know if this guy's like that i don't know i can't say he's like that i  don't know well we got a guy that listens to his show uh religiously okay uh rocko in new hampshire 
[02:23:30]  rocko dude dude it's thermite man thermite what do you know on alex jones you listen all the time  actually alex jones has been around for a while um he's been around for probably about 15 years  he's a really really good researcher scares the living shit out of me though and a lot of times  you listen to him and you he's got a four four an hour show or something like that and i only catch  him on uh my ipod uh he's got a podcast and he put that too but um i in his shows he talks about 
[02:24:00]  a lot of conspiracy theories but he backs them up with a lot of i'll call it interesting factoids  because really any theory just has to be proven no matter which way you twist and turn and jimmy  know that more than anything yeah um anything i mean even a theory like the theory of relativity  it's not it's never been proven if you think about it but yet we live day in day out you know so  these theories have a lot of backing to them and they're very interesting in a lot of theory yeah  well danny just said danny just said danny sometimes makes really good points into the keyboard he said 
[02:24:30]  he said that's why it's a theory theory of relativity but it's right fact of relativity  he's right the law of relativity yeah yeah and you know it you know and you can go on and on and on  and this argument is never going to be proven in any way shape and form in our lifetime but the fact of  the matter is is that if you listen to him and just really think about what he's talking about it  is really interesting and you know jim and uh and i've been listening to you guys for years too  you know but you've got great theories and you've got really great intelligence to you jimmy you know 
[02:25:00]  you're great as well you know oh you're a dick but i love you wow well that's wonderful that's what  i want on my fucking tombstone go fuck yourself how's that rock you want go fuck yourself on your  tombstone exactly that's what i'm gonna have on mine but no seriously you guys all have great views and  this guy's really good too don't attack him just listen to him he's really i'm not gonna dude i'm not gonna  attack him unless he attacks us i'm not i don't have him on to disprove his theories like oh we  don't it was more like i hear he's an interesting guy and if he's got a radio show that does 
[02:25:30]  conspiracies to me that's interesting so it's not about attacking him or proving him wrong  it's not about that it's like i think he's probably an interesting dude yeah and you know  i'm not a conspiracy theorist i listen to all views i mean you know whether 9-11 was an inside  job or not it's fine i don't you know whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen well it'll come out  eventually but at the same time you know you think about all the like little things like you  know hole in the pentagon five you know five feet wide or five meters wide whatever it is there's a  lot of interesting stuff there five meters what you mean you mean that hole that the firemen made 
[02:26:00]  when they broke through the wall as opposed to the other hole that the actual plane made when it hit  on an angle so that's why it wasn't the shape of the plane like it was in the world trade center  and it was concrete and brickwork instead of uh steel and and there's absolutely evidence of engine  parts and fuselage parts and plane parts all over the place yeah i know yeah it's like it's it that's  what bothers me about conspiracy guys is like they they never acknowledge facts that disprove what 
[02:26:30]  they're saying regardless of how strong the facts are and to me the hey guys how you doing oh okay  alex that happened alex are we just connected to alex oh are we live on air right now yeah  dude nobody even told us you were coming in well okay i mean they just pointed me in here and said  they're gonna be ready for you in a minute and i walked in here and sat down oh cool good thing i  didn't say anything embarrassing that's fine i mean if you need a couple minutes no problem no no it's  good to be here on the show i've heard it many times and i hear people talking about it all the time  so i know it's very very uh influential so it's good to be here with you yeah we were just hashing 
[02:27:00]  over uh some of the you know biggest conspiracies that are going on the these days and over the  past few years of course 9-11 and uh the whole new world order thing um so where where where do you  stand on a lot of these is it are you one of these just it's an absolute conspiracy uh a little more  open-minded with these things uh where where do you stand well really i'm somebody who goes off the  facts off of what i can prove now people can have disagreements about the way i interpret things 
[02:27:30]  uh but uh 15 years ago when i first got on radio i talked about the gulf of tonkin uh being staged to  get us into vietnam in 1964 and i had the san diego newspaper clippings from the time from research  i'd done and from books i'd read uh and but it was only a rumor for the general public so it was a  conspiracy theory and of course five years ago it was declassified that the gulf of tonkin was staged 
[02:28:00]  and they released the lbj tapes with mcnamara where they planned to stage it and mcnamara tells  the president showing who the boss was how they were going to stage it and what he would say  coming up in two days at the press conference and it's lbj at his ranch outside austin where i sit  and mcnamara the defense secretary at the pentagon and another example is uh more than 10 years ago i had  declassified hidden in plain view government documents about terraforming or geoengineering of the globe going  on uh since the mid 90s there's been a giant covert hidden in plain view weather modification going 
[02:28:30]  on on a global scale uh and uh it's run by the pentagon and now two years ago uh the at the end  of the bush administration they began to declassify more of it and then john p holder in the white house  science czar went public in his first press conference and announced that they basically  can manipulate and control the weather it's a secret program but he's just letting us know what's  going on they're saving us from global warming so so my point is one man's conspiracy theory is 
[02:29:00]  somebody else's facts now are there people saying they're blood-drinking lizards from planet pop tart  that are cyclically controlling our brains are there schizophrenics running around who you know think  that they're jesus and the pope and uh mary and joan of arc and a kibler elf uh rolled into one and also  the lucky charms uh you know person yes but i'm somebody who just covers the facts i can prove and i found  nine times out of ten truth is much stranger uh than fiction alex let me just see where they can  hear alex too he's on uh xm 165 talk radio saturday so he's not on sirius only on xm 6 to 9 p.m eastern 
[02:29:30]  you're not uh from the school of thought that that sometimes the um path of least resistance is  in fact the facts well the social engineers uh are able to predictively especially with computers but  before they had idiots savants uh and others that were able to societally manipulate uh things they  call it the scientific dictatorship the final revolution this is what uh all the top uh globalist  even you know 60 70 80 90 years ago bertrand russell hg wells and countless others who who wrote fiction 
[02:30:00]  and non-fiction who were members of the british royal society they talked about understanding normal  weakness normal human behavior and then guiding things and manipulating things through our normal  instincts and so yes most of what goes on is just human weakness and human greed and lust and avarice  uh but the new world order like a symphony conductor knows how to play all those different factors 
[02:30:30]  together in a type of three level uh chess uh where they're looking forward long term and they're also  willing to make sacrifices the the only thing that i find troubling about any uh conspiracy is the fact that  i've never seen a group of people able to work together to be quiet um enough for long enough  where it doesn't come out and and uh get exposed in some way shape or form well i totally agree with 
[02:31:00]  you i absolutely totally agree with you that's why people got off the ships in san diego after the  gulf of tonkin on when they rotated back a year later and they the captain of one of the ships and some of the  top officers said it was totally staged no torpedoes were fired at us and so the truth did come out just  like i've interviewed police officers and firefighters and medical workers that said they heard the  countdown to blow up building seven uh and now uh even a fox news reporter admitted okay well there was  going to be a countdown to blow it up but since it fell on its own uh we didn't have to blow up building 
[02:31:30]  seven on nine eleven so i agree with you this stuff all comes out i don't see i don't agree with that  whole thing um as far as building seven goes and uh the world trade center being rigged for explosives  because it just doesn't make sense that something on that grand of a scale when you know the facts about  building demolition you could not possibly plant that much explosives within a building that is 
[02:32:00]  operating i don't care if there was uh some people taking some days off and some floors were closed  and there were maintenance crews when you watch a building being demolished it takes uh weeks if not  months of prep work by professional and now all you need is some jet fuel and uh even though the  firefighters reported that most of the fires were out and people were standing and gaping holes in the  north and south tower waving white shirts calling for help suddenly those giant four foot around columns  shattered and were projected 600 feet into other buildings and well when they didn't find any body 
[02:32:30]  parts bigger than about an inch because the explosives were so high powered well tower one and two were  non-conventional uh massive explosives top down building seven was a classic controlled demolition  and of course the cia was based in the building see i cannot absolutely cannot accept that i i  accept the fact that uh it was extremists that hate our way of life hate our country uh  freedom hate our freedom of course and flew uh planes into buildings and the buildings were not 
[02:33:00]  uh set up to take that kind of heat not melting till the point of liquid but enough to weaken the  structure so that when it did collapse when you have that much weight falling on uh onto itself you're  going to get pieces of metal flying out uh as if there was an explosion because literally it is the power  of an explosion you're getting that much energy is being dispersed uh out of the building you know  that nist had given all those reasons the pancake and they said tower one and two were hollow which 
[02:33:30]  wasn't true and now they've had to reverse all that and on building seven they've given six different  reasons and had to reverse it i mean if you look at building seven uh you know we interviewed the head  the deputy head of emergency management uh mr jennings in new york barry jennings and then about a week  later he mysteriously died after we aired the interview with him and he talked about how they  blew up building seven and of course then he died mysteriously how how then was was this explosives uh 
[02:34:00]  how these explosives brought into these buildings well i mean let's talk about seven it had the fbi  nsa cia defense intelligence it was the biggest uh single in u.s intelligence building uh private  intelligence building in the world uh most uh buildings of that size 47 stories or more are  completely government installations like fort mead uh with the nsa and others the entire building  was a giant spook command base 
[02:34:30]  yeah you like that uh little uh ding ding there i absolutely do is that the pavlovian  conditioning hey guys but i also want to tell you i am on xm they they are one hour my syndicated  radio show also at night but i really appreciate you guys out of the gates plugging that you guys  also the websites are infowars.com and prison planet.com and that's where people can actually  go and look at the information that we actually cover i mean i was talking 10 years ago when they  got rid of glass steagle actually 11 years ago with economist about how the imf and world bank had 
[02:35:00]  gotten rid of glass steagle type legislation uh in third world nations by design gone  in and paid off governments to do it so the private banks could come in and sell derivatives  to the countries to financially destroy them and now we have the goldman sachs timberwolf emails  we have the mcclatchy newspaper emails that they got where goldman sachs premeditatedly  sold derivatives to destroy their competition and to uh collapse the economy so they can consolidate  power and new and now the new banking re-regulation uh legislation even the washington post 
[02:35:30]  admits allows the private federal reserve to fully uh take over any banks or institutions  they wish and gobble up their competition that's why the texas banking association president two  months ago wrote an editorial saying this is a criminal takeover by the very central banks that  engineered the financial collapse but we hear on the news oh obama's getting tough on those rascally  bankers he's going to show them by giving them even more power it'd be like if uh  uh somebody robbed a bank and the police showed up and said wait a minute you just stole a million 
[02:36:00]  dollars we're going to give you a truckload of gold bars to punish you uh and uh 15 hookers how  does that can i ask a question this is off the subject there's something i wanted to ask in the  beginning then we got into 9-11 what made you a conspiracy guy like because to me my problem not  problem my issue with conspiracies is that it seems like a lot of times people become so uh invested in  the idea that a conspiracy must exist that their agenda becomes proving a conspiracy as opposed to 
[02:36:30]  seeing sometimes plain and simple facts in the other direction uh now you seem to be a very well  informed guy like what put you on the road to like thinking that there's a lot of conspiracies and i  believe that some of them you're probably very right about well that's a really good question uh i  mean i number one uh you know i played football and drank beer and everything else in high school but i  also um because my mom's got a degree in history i happen to see a lot of history books laying around  from the time i was about 11 and i started reading history books voraciously instead of fiction  and i read gibbons rise and fall the roman empire rise and decline of the roman empire shearers 
[02:37:00]  rise and fall the third reich heinz hobel's order of the death's head i read the secret wartime report  that had been declassified around that time of the mind of adolf hitler uh i read about the japanese  imperial system uh i studied the aztec uh kingdom and and all of the subterfuge and conspiracies and the  ruling classes and how they engineered societies even thousands of years ago and then in my high  school i i never really did drugs you know i smoked pot here and there but i'd been to parties where 
[02:37:30]  people were using drugs and i also hung out when i was in high school you know with college kids  and so i would see the uh police who i'd see do drug raids at my school i would then drive across the  lake from rockwall to uh ralette and i'd see the same cop at a college party selling cocaine and so  then i found out that the sheriff was dealing cocaine that the police that the police were  involved and later they did go to prison for it but so i saw them doing drug raids at the school  and busting kids for you know half a joint or a roach and then i saw them parading around the 
[02:38:00]  news as our saviors but i knew full well by the time i you know uh you know left uh you know dallas  and moved to austin that that the police and and then later i found out i knew some uh i had some  friends who had older brothers who were drug dealers uh in dallas and they said of course  you know we get our marijuana and and other drugs from the dallas police department out of the drug  lockup and then i would see the news saying it's ridiculous police don't deal drugs and then later  i read about serpico and other cases and i interviewed famous new york detectives uh where in the 60s 
[02:38:30]  and then again in the 70s they had to fire over 75 of the vice squad in new york because they were  dealing drugs and running wars but then the news told me the police don't deal drugs then in 96 i  watched the the congressional hearings where the cia solicitor inspector general admitted that the cia  shipped in the majority of the cocaine during the 80s and gave the crack cocaine uh recipe to people  and then later interviewed free ricky ross and others and i mean i mean look now on fox news i have 
[02:39:00]  video you can just google fox news admits pentagon growing opium and it's so in our face now they  have araldo go i'm going to talk to this colonel in the marine corps colonel uh so you're guarding  the opium yes we don't like it but we actually help them grow it now and if we don't grow it and ship  it out uh then uh al-qaeda will get the opium money so okay whatever you decriminalize it then al-qaeda  al-ci-ada that we admittedly created in the 80s they won't be making money off of it because it won't be 
[02:39:30]  illegal anymore i mean now reuters ap new york times all admit our government grows  the freaking smack and ships it in i'm tired of it i'm tired of it they're drug dealers they've got  the drugs illegal so they can get higher prices shipping it in can you can i can i say if you  didn't say al-ci-i-a-c-i-a how did you say it al-ci-ada if you didn't say we created in the 80s that  would i just never would have gotten the fact you were saying cia but that made me go back and think 
[02:40:00]  al-ci-ada uh i i i i gotta ask you what is the end game here because it seems like all of  these are somehow tied in to this giant power grab who is the head of this where is it going why  haven't we gotten to the point where uh this entity this thing that is doing all this has ultimate  control where is the end game in this whole uh big big picture social darwinism the final revolution i 
[02:40:30]  have literally over a hundred government finance textbooks like eco science by john p holdren the  current white house science czar where they say a planetary dictatorship the financial times of  london had an article uh titled just last year and now for world government and they admit we're smarter  than you we kept it secret for your own good it is a kind gentle authoritarianism an oppressive system  for your own good we are going to create a global government control grid that controls all the 
[02:41:00]  resources all the money we are then going to create a carbon footprint because humans exhale carbon  dioxide and we are going to tax that and we're going to have a one world government that enforces a  one world one child policy and we are going to phase out at least eighty percent of the world  population as state department memorandum declassified 1992 written 1973 state department memorandum  200 and it's uh double coded also as a cia document state department memorandum 200 states that they 
[02:41:30]  will use war famine and sterilization programs at that time to reach the goals that if third world  countries want u.s loans half of their population uh must be reduced so i'm not to interrupt you i'm  sorry but just a question on the theory of it because i'm why theory okay oh your feelings on it if  this whole state in fact i have all their guts they think we're so dumb this is admitted  hold on if this is what's happening or if there's a world order why would those who are in charge of 
[02:42:00]  it allow information to be passed so easily in this like when you look at what you could have done in  1975 abu grabe was not even able to be kept a secret there are really secrets are so easily exposed  now why allow the system to progressively get more and more transparent not by their doing but  simply by the way information is passed no they've actually done cycle that's a very astute point you  made uh there are psychological warfare studies uh from the 50s the first ones i read by british 
[02:42:30]  intelligence that were declassified and then you can read more modern uh versions in in psychological  uh treatises out there about learned helplessness acclimation to where now they just basically  don't even care if i'm on the air throwing all this out uh they know the average person is just  going to think it's a conspiracy theory and not actually go read these government textbooks here's  an example uh in montebello two years ago it was in the toronto star that the police attacked their own 
[02:43:00]  police as a pretext to then attack the peaceful protesters to create a pretext in the future to just shut  down protest altogether police admitted that uh the pentagon sent in troops uh dressed as anarchist  in 99 uh to attack uh police as a pretext to then demonize them on the news agent provocateurs and now  at the g20 in pittsburgh and at the g20 in toronto that was going on this week last week they actually 
[02:43:30]  have black vans pulling up we have video this up on infowars.com black vans pulling up and grabbing  protesters peaceful protesters for no reason men women you name it children in some cases and dragging  them into black vans and driving away with them and i discovered going back to g20 meetings three  four years ago in different parts of the world that it was staged they were grabbing actors who were role 
[02:44:00]  players to scare everyone and they would do it in front of news cameras to say you may not just get  arrested if you protest you may disappear with plainclothes men grabbing you and putting you in  vans well they have and then the news says oh my god look the government's kidnapping people and then now  this year they're actually doing it for real so just like jack bauer tortures somebody's kid on 24  in front of their parents to get answers and it turns out he's the good guy they're reshaping us  through pavlovian conditioning social conditioning to accept that secret arrest kidnapping abu graib is 
[02:44:30]  good they're they're releasing this on purpose bush came out two weeks ago and said yeah i ordered  torture and i'd do it again meanwhile the people he ordered to do it went to prison but it's all part  of the conditioning process why my thing is why allow the real information out because like something  like the freedom of information act that's such a if if the the world dominance or world order is the  issue why why would you allow something like the freedom of information they probably argue that 
[02:45:00]  there's certain information they would want to get out absolutely let me break that down very very  very good point there as well let's why do we have the national security act why do we have the foyer  uh act 1947 almost everything the u.s government does is out in the open the british oss founds the cia  out of uh blue bloods at yale skull and bones you know that's mainline news and covered in the film  uh the good shepherd that robert robert de niro made with matt damon but if you watch that i mean what 
[02:45:30]  do you have you have satanic rituals going on with the guys that founded the cia well that's actually  true who is skull and bones uh and i'm going to answer your question uh this way uh skull and bones  in 1832 this is encyclopedia britannica in 1832 british intelligence uh came in and made deals with  some of the wealthiest people in the u.s we just beaten the british you know 40 years before or so 
[02:46:00]  and they came in and they and this has now been released as part of their annals and said we're  going to take over yale and harvard and princeton and we're going to kind of merge the u.s again back  into the british empire but you'll share in the empire and they made deals with the  robber barons and they said we're going to finance you with rothschild uh money and we're  going to finance the rockefellers and others is when all this got started and we're going to set  up british intel uh through your and that's all a secret society was in that day and age was a private  intelligence agency and they did it through elite colleges because that's where the elite families 
[02:46:30]  are and so that's how we got the cia after world war ii out of british intelligence oss and skull  and bones founded the cia and americans and the congress said you want unlimited power  to to rob banks to whatever you have to worldwide to fund your operations you want all this incredible  power smedley butler had just come out the former marine corps two-time congressional medal was that  really his name smedley butler that that sounds like a name somebody makes up to make up an awful 
[02:47:00]  name that's a terrible name yeah all right god sorry but well no i mean smedley butler he's the  most highly decorated marine in u.s history but smedley butler came out and said look there is a  basically a foreign intelligence operation taken over the u.s they tried to hire me to overthrow the  united states and they said we don't care smudley smedley we're setting it up and they tried to hire  him to be part of this they wanted to just have a complete coup but smedley blew the whistle so they just  said look we'll just have a national security state and so congress said okay but you got to 
[02:47:30]  have a four-year request where 20 years later things have to be released and you notice now  it's 40 plus years after kennedy and now they've backed it up to permanent first thing obama did when  he got in is he just said forget it it's supposed to be declassified uh it's unlimited classification now  and so they do and more and more they're denying for your request i i put in three or four times  in the last five years for my fbi file my nsa file by federal law i'm supposed to get it and they don't 
[02:48:00]  even respond so i had a lawyer send letters and they said look it's national security we're not telling  you what we got on jones on you national security yeah they will not they will not give me my files  see the kennedy assassination is one too like i was very very big on the conspiracy i believed it very  thoroughly i went to dilly plaza you know i read a lot of the uh the books on it and and then the  more i would hear little things that would kind of go against conspiracies which sounded like 
[02:48:30]  and then uh i did a little bit more research and i actually found a lot of the stuff that uh the  conspiracy guys really sell just wasn't so and it seems like they deny a lot of the things like  like buliosi raised a good point in his book about how a fact that uh supports uh things just  being the way we think they are is ignored by a lot of theorists and an innuendo that appears to ruin  the fact is taken as fact and let me tell you a story the person that was the uh that ran the funeral 
[02:49:00]  home the person that ran the funeral home uh and and he's very wealthy guy he owns a bunch of  funeral homes all over the state of texas now he was a young man at the time uh the fbi came in put  black ink on oswald's hand and then put the black ink on the gun uh i i interviewed him he actually  showed up at a radio event for 5 90 a.m the station i'm on and it turned out to be him it turned out to 
[02:49:30]  be the guy you know famous guy and he went further than ever and he said come to my house uh you know  sometime this week and i'll give you a full interview and about two hours before i was there to interview  him he was riding with his uh wife in a wealthy area of austin and got run off the road and has  now been unable to talk to me because he got hurt so bad uh i mean you want to talk about hardcore  uh number one i'm a great shot with a rifle you know born and raised in texas uh i've gone out in  the field uh with that type of cruddy post world war one rifle and you can't hit the side of a barn with 
[02:50:00]  it uh i mean you can't barely even shoot it three times in six seconds even though one round's  already chambered much less aim the thing and i mean i i mean i mean hundreds of witnesses saw  plumes of smoke and men behind the knoll and the railroad operator who was 50 yards away in the  railroad tower who they killed two days later when he went public i mean he saw the men shooting he saw  them in the green green pickup truck i mean they were running around killing people left and right 
[02:50:30]  uh i mean my family's from dallas my family that's just incredible i had family who were cops in  dallas uh i've interviewed fort worth star telegram reporters uh who who were friends with ruby and  drank at his topless well the guy let me say the guy the the shot i know again you you say that it's  an impossible shot to make and i'd heard that there was i think a specialist i i don't want to say his  name wrong i think his name was miller who not only reenacted the uh yeah they have discovery 
[02:51:00]  channel puff pieces the shooting the facts are wrong and where the guns were and but i'm saying  i've heard that that that shot had been reenacted by a guy who actually used the actual gun and  actually improved a little bit on oswald's time and i've also heard do you know what fletcher  prouty said uh no but he's the one by the way just so people know he's the one that mr x uh donald  sutherland's character i mean fletcher wrote the secret team it's on record he was the head of black  cops for the entire pentagon as liaison to cia and it's on i mean they had lawrence livermore 
[02:51:30]  laboratory even the dallas morning news who's been one of the biggest absconders with the truth  on the jfk assassination uh two years ago had to admit that the government itself but a sub compartment  uh did bullet fragment tests and found it wasn't the same bullet i mean do you know what happens if  you fire a full metal jacket bullet into water it bends more than that did that shot through two  people three or four bones in a car seat i mean do you know what happens to a hollow nose uh it a 
[02:52:00]  hollow nose comes out a soft tip comes out better uh than uh when you shoot hard objects because it's  it's it's able to bend quicker if you shoot metal and bones with a full metal jacket it shatters  okay it shatters the bullets shatter guys guys go out and buy a brisket or or buy a big side of beef  that's got a bone in it and go out with a 30 odd six at 100 yards away and shoot through the meat and 
[02:52:30]  the bone with a full metal jacket round and that full metal jacket round is going to look like hammered  crap so why let me ask you this this this is what doesn't make sense to me why go through all that  like they want to kill kennedy they want to use oswald to do it they wanted to do it in plain  view so everybody that could think would know we're the mafia we've taken over america it's a black  op why rule any politicians that get in our why not just kill oswald why do you have him shoot jd 
[02:53:00]  tippet why why not just kill like they can't be such geniuses and so capable of cover-up and yet make  such glaringly easy to fix mistakes like why allow oswald to ever be taken in for questioning  why not i mean again if they could set all this up you pen a phony suicide note and oswald blows his  brains out that's a much simple why do you get jack ruby involved this that's a good point for most 
[02:53:30]  of the experts i've talked to too much uh he got nervous just like tim mcveigh got nervous of being set  up uh lee harvey oswald got nervous and wasn't didn't go where he was supposed to go and it also  turns out that you know one of these other cops was a literal lookalike i mean it's now been  declassified that yes he was at a u2 spy base uh in japan yes he did have national security clearance  i mean no one is allowed to defect to the russians in the late 1950s early 60s and then come back to the 
[02:54:00]  united states i mean this guy had his address next to the fbi and the cia in new orleans i mean  you've got guys guys listen in any black op in any big operation they create an artificial fog of war  i'm surprised they didn't have a fat lady running around naked that day paint herself blue you know  with a paint roller but i'm surprised they didn't have airplanes fly over and you know throw ostriches  out on top why make such always do confusing things to create confusion to where it gets so 
[02:54:30]  confusing that that even good investigators can't ever figure out why make such a sorry to interrupt  why make such a glaring because i've heard again i can't argue the bullet um because i don't know  enough about the the physics of it but i've heard it debated um i have heard it debated and i found that  what i've heard in the film jfk about the magic bullet theory wasn't correct um that why go why make 
[02:55:00]  such a glaring easy to prove error like it just doesn't make a set that these geniuses can can be  influential enough to to set up the president and they make that mistake sure look let's just move on  from the jfk assassination because the i mean you can i mean i'll keep talking about if you want but  over 90 percent of americans now in polls it was just 80 percent a few years ago uh believe that  the government's lying about what happened uh with jfk and i understand that it becomes popular to be 
[02:55:30]  contrarian and i've been trying to make a jfk film for five years and it does become such a big  quagmire a tar baby uh where you know there's disinformation on both sides there's lies on both  sides the issue is the preponderance of the evidence is jfk and bobby and i've talked to jfk's  uh secretary by the way were fearing for their lives they had been death-threaded well sure no  of course president attorney general yeah at that time especially sure well i mean it has been 
[02:56:00]  declassified uh that l.l lemnitzer the head of the joint chief of staff came to kennedy and sadly bobby  greenlighted it that that that's been declassified that's abc news baltimore sun uh but jfk said no  they wanted to bomb dc bomb miami shoot cops in miami uh they wanted to attack u.s military bases  and claim that cuban terrorists they wanted to launch a fake war on terror they even had in there  how to it's called operation northwoods yeah they've had in their ways to grab patsy cubans 
[02:56:30]  who they'd put on trial and execute now isn't this more of a not where we want to do this we're going  to do this than a let us look at every option we can to get into cuba and and get rid of uh castro  obviously it covers you know these days whenever you go into a war you cover everything from  a knife fight to nuclear weapons not this was everything in between no it's no it wasn't just 
[02:57:00]  some idea of a scenario bantered uh uh ballied about between a scenario that you can go you can  google operation you can google operation northwoods national security archive but i mean let me just  tell you this was obvious this was declassified uh in 2000 national security archive released in 2000  the actual operation northwoods then four months ago the state department declassified its memorandums  and minutes of meetings with lemnanzer with bobby kennedy and with jfk and the original uh communique 
[02:57:30]  and the original battle plan uh is a operational uh plan that they that had been green lighted by the  joint chiefs of staff and they were asking for approval uh to invade so so so this was a a bay of  pigs uh cuban missile crisis era plan this is what they wanted to do and bobby uh said well actually  let's attack our embassy in honduras instead of killing u.s citizens bobby said i don't mind 
[02:58:00]  i don't mind uh killing a few people but let's not have it be actual embassy staff uh in honduras  uh and then let's say cuba did that it's too incredible to say that fidel castro would attack  the u.s and so they took that to kennedy and then and then he fired lemnanzer and he fired uh the  dallas brothers and the head of the cia and no it's on record on record that this was an operational  green light battle plan and kennedy had also given the order to recall our troops from vietnam he'd 
[02:58:30]  signed an executive order to begin abolishing the federal reserve but i don't think anybody's  disagreeing that there was a lot of motives to have jfk killed honestly you might be right about  all that i'm not i don't know i'm not saying you're wrong and i'm not saying there weren't a lot  of motives to have any president killed but what i'm giving you is is absolute admitted government  fact gulf of tonkin was staged uh they did plan to stage terror attacks in the u.s even his brother  agreed but said do it in latin america and kennedy said no and they said you think you're the president 
[02:59:00]  we'll bang you die we're going to blow your head off in plain view we're going to show everybody else  in the establishment that the cia can control the media that we can kill a president in plain view and  kill hundreds and hundreds of witnesses and hundreds and hundreds of people were killed  that were witnesses to the fact hundreds were killed do you hear how the the thing i have the  issue i have with that is like and then there's disinformation to me that the conspiracy guys buy  like well oswald was a terrible shot first of all the the he was a sharpshooter he was not a terrible 
[02:59:30]  shot it was a terrible rifle he was he was a terrible but there's that myth that he was a terrible  shot and he was not a terrible shot he classified as a sharpshooter and as a marchman before he left the  military and to think that they would use such a blundering that guy wasn't a communist he's on  record now cia no point i'm making is why would they use guys let's go back but alex why would  they use a bad shot like i'm just very basic common sense things like they're going to pull  this off you know what this is a straw man argument listen listen you know what a straw man argument is 
[03:00:00]  right no i don't it's the but it's how it's what makes me question you may not let me just tell  them okay alex jones says the caribbean is aquamarine blue at high noon alex jones says that  if you go down to belize at high noon on average day that the beautiful waters are aquamarine blue  light blue and that the sand is white now somebody goes out on the internet and they say no in the  caribbean the sand is purple and the water is black and there are sea monsters swimming around in it 
[03:00:30]  that's what alex jones said okay listen i there are what a conspiracy theory is with the dominant  controlled dinosaur corporate media what we're sold as a conspiracy theory as anything any thought  outside of the established received knowledge given to us by abc cbs nbc or fox news okay the dry  stale teleprompter dying media anything outside of that is called speculation opinion uh conspiracy 
[03:01:00]  theory it's way to put something in a box it's it's a way to minimize uh people's ideas it's a way to put  a stereo but i'm not doing that but i'm not doing that what i'm trying to finish saying you're being  very kind let me just finish because it's key is that i can't speak for for the millions of kooks  out there that call themselves conspiracy theorists who make things up and then who discredit real  discourse but but but there are people who defend the establishment and still say that there were 
[03:01:30]  wnds in iraq and bush didn't lie about it when we have the government documents white house and  downing street memos where they knew there weren't i think that's pretty well accepted these days i'm  not talking about i'm not even saying you're wrong about that what i'm and what i'm talking about is  the the myths that are held by a lot of conspiracy theorists about about oswald's shooting ability  and things like that and you don't hear conspiracy theorists coming out and going well you know what  that's incorrect yeah she was a good shot uh there were actually people on the fifth floor who heard 
[03:02:00]  the shell casings hitting from the floor above like there's a lot of things that have happened  and then people hang on to the fact that like well the uh the uh house select committee on  assassinations uh said yes it was a conspiracy because of some audio uh thing that they heard it's like  you just don't hear the conspiracy theorists owning up to anything well in 1979 uh the congressional  long investigation uh found that there was a 95 chance that it was a conspiracy and that other 
[03:02:30]  people were involved and i'll tell you my just i think you're right about that and i know that i mean  i've got a copy of the report i'm saying i think you're right about that i just don't have it in front  of me um but the the evidence was not based on medical evidence it was not based on any type  of physical evidence it was based on acoustics i've interviewed dallas morning news reporters  who talked to the surgeons at parkland who said his brain was completely blown out and then they  gave us a fake brain and put it in a glass jar and then when that became an investigation it was robbed 
[03:03:00]  it disappeared out of the national archives i mean come on guys he was at a cia spook base but hold  i mean the guy was at a total black ops base in japan was allowed to go into russia to bring back  a russian wife he was a deep cover national security operative so exactly so if that's true why use him  why use a guy they always burn their their their military black op lower level people so they take  a guy like that they allow him to do it and then they allow him to be picked up and questioned by the 
[03:03:30]  dallas police i don't know if he did it you know that's the problem listen guys i mean let's just  take 9-11 for a moment okay right he may be he may have been one of the shooters that's the whole issue  is that that's how they do these black ops to where you can prove that the official story is a lie  but because it's different intelligence agencies and people say well was it the mafia almost all these tv  shows say some conspiracy theorists say it's the mafia some say the pentagon others say it was rogue 
[03:04:00]  people in the south who were handing out flyers saying he was guilty of treason for civil rights  others say it was the israelis others say it was the russians others say it was just mcveigh acting  alone or or or oswald and then when you actually go look at all the pieces when you actually go do all  the research when you actually look at it you find out that going back to world war ii that's what  the oss and then cia would do they use local mafia they use local hitmen and then they'll have another  backup team on top of that there'll be three four groups of shooters not even knowing the other 
[03:04:30]  groups are there these guys are compartmentalized you ever seen a mission impossible this message  will self-destruct in 10 seconds that is literally how this stuff works it's all compartmentalization  so these geniuses who can oversee all of this they're called spy masters yes they leave all of these  things to chance they basically leave all of these things to the human factors are all going to go off  without a hitch and they make such glaringly bad decisions and such glaring errors that i can see 
[03:05:00]  and believe me i dropped out of high school that you think anybody constructing a conspiracy of that  level would have stopped would have easily seen coming or nipped in the bud okay guys please let me go  over this with you it was a conspiracy theory that our ships were attacked now it's admitted  it was a conspiracy theory that the government planned to stage terror attacks to blame it  uh on iran now that's been declassified i mean it's in the new yorker magazine confirmed white house 
[03:05:30]  officials admitting that three years ago dick cheney wanted to paint up u.s ships like iranian ships  and blow up a u.s destroyer okay guys when you begin to understand that of course  they would use two different cia teams and a mafia hit team all men who had committed scores of  murders and assassinations i mean let's take e howard hunt okay uh e howard hunt of course 
[03:06:00]  everybody knows about the cover of rolling stone a few years ago the deathbed confession of e howard hunt  well guess what we actually broke that first and we've interviewed saint john hunt you should have  him on and we actually released on youtube the video and the audio of e howard hunt who was  actually arrested that day photographed it looks just like him as one of the tramps that people said  they saw shooting and then ran to one of the rail cars and the police were ordered then to release them 
[03:06:30]  and e howard hunt uh who admittedly in world war ii was a sniper in china okay he he he said in his  deathbed confession to his son that yes lbj and others and that's as high as it went wanted kennedy  dead and that yes he wasn't pulling triggers there he was running multiple hit teams running mafia hit  teams uh he was running a european hit team a a pentagon hit team and that he was there for the 
[03:07:00]  quote big event they had planned to kill him in chicago the week before but that was called off so  by the way when e howard hunt threatened to go public with this uh for hush money whenever they  were sending him to prison for watergate when his wife's plane was coming in with with with the money  in chicago and i and i've interviewed uh the uh detectives and and police involved they blew her  aircraft up uh coming in with everybody aboard just to get her so lbj wants kennedy dead okay i would 
[03:07:30]  never say that wasn't true so the way they stage it is a few cars in front of lyndon b johnson uh and  his wife and connelly and his wife and they do it in a way where there are so many possibilities of  failure as opposed to just planting a bomb in his car and blowing it up no because then they couldn't  have a lone gunman sure they could have a lone bomber who wanted it to be a public execution so  with anybody with a brain would know hey black ops runs this country there's been a private 
[03:08:00]  corporate takeover of america and if any of you politicians get out of line we're going to kill  you in broad daylight and we've got the power we've got the power to cover it up so to make  have you seen the footage of the motorcade where the secret service throws fits when they didn't  take the route they ordered him to take the safer route when they ordered the bubble off the top and  when they told well that was kennedy who ordered the bubble off the top yes yes but but but but when  others ordered him not to run alongside the cars that was i think that was kennedy too i think 
[03:08:30]  kennedy had a really weird he didn't want to appear weak in the south i believe he didn't want to appear  overly paranoid uh i'm not saying there weren't terrible decisions made but again if you're going  to assassinate him publicly i don't say that that couldn't happen you do it the dallas trademark  because again he's assassinated publicly he was going to be there speaking a few minutes later  and there's nothing to chance you have a guy open up on him in front of everybody  it's like all this crazy stuff they throw in that is so easy to disprove hey guys you know that the 
[03:09:00]  adam gadon videos they put out of the american al-qaeda you know they got caught uploading the  al-qaeda logo in the intel center logo and that intel center is admittedly run by two former heads of cia  and pentagon psyops i mean i mean they have a a group run run by known black ops that uploads fake  videos and then three weeks ago the washington post in the spy talk column interviewed high-level cia  operatives who admitted that yes we put out a fake bin laden video now i already knew those were fake 
[03:09:30]  they done right so the same thing is they're just going go you know they have a raldo up there oh  uh yeah the government is growing the opium and then oh yeah uh you know uh washington post we are  uh you know putting out fake videos so we're putting out fake okay hold on so former fake cia  guys are putting up the adam gadon video and the uh the other uh videos bin laden has been fake and  that's known foundry logos so what is let me ask you how does it work where somebody will call up 
[03:10:00]  because again i understand if it was one news organization that's one thing but you have a lot  of reporters involved and now you have a lot of news outlets so what happens does somebody go look we  have this information the bin laden video was faked with voice tracking and they go to who the news  editors who go uh no i want to be specific i mean i mean this actually happened so let me just go over  what happened um back in 2001 2002 right after it happened they had prestigious uh experts in voice 
[03:10:30]  print in face print and then also in in uh linguist and in voice inflections in france in canada in the  u.s it was it was in major newspapers but it only came out here and there it never became a big you  know national news story like uh the lacey peterson case or something and but it was there hidden in  plain view that not only can they take real bin laden audio and do a voice print and create a voice 
[03:11:00]  key that will open doors or start cars or you know get you on your computer i mean you know they know  voice print that's why you can call up to your own phone and set up a a program a decade ago and  speak into the phone and it does voice print analysis and lets you into your voicemail okay  well the same system they take a real bin laden tape and they run it into that and then they take  the new one and it doesn't pass voice print then they had linguist you can pull up the stories  i even forget what universities it was all over the news and they go that's not even a guy from the  middle east that's somebody who probably is arabic probably uh lived in uh the united states most 
[03:11:30]  their lives i mean you know they can tell just like an american i mean you're not a linguist but  you could say that guy sounds like he's from new jersey or that guy sounds like he's from alabama  or a fine southern gentleman sounds like they're from uh georgia i mean people know that well you  take somebody who's a linguist that studies arabic voices arabic dialects and then they're on record  saying that's not him but you could look at it they didn't even get a good guy and the cia bragged  about that famous video and said yeah it wasn't a fake computer video and and they did release some of 
[03:12:00]  those i mean you could it looked like final fantasy it was that basic computer template  i mean looked like something like a doom the video game it was i mean they've got some of those too  they're just completely fake robot talking head because they're so lazy and think we're so dumb  but the particular one is just a fat bin laden whose nose suddenly got even bigger sitting around  drinking with young boys and sounds like a lucky bin laden to me yeah so so that's how dumb and  so so they know that the average media person kind of buys into the false reality 
[03:12:30]  the average media person uh just even if they decide to have an awakening suddenly their buddies  say oh well you're a kook and then maybe their editor lets them run the story but then it doesn't  become a big national news cycle so it's a dead issue what bothers me about this stuff is like the  amount of people you have to involve there's hiding in plain sight and then there's misinformation  but the amount of people you have to involve to make these things work to me is not created by 
[03:13:00]  these mass conspirators it is created by conspiracy theorists who can't explain it any other way like  almost like and i'm not going to obsess over jfk i'm only mentioning that because that's probably the  most famous of all conspiracy theories is that in order to make their theory work the dallas police  department has to be involved there has to be a lot of people involved are you kidding you know how  corrupt the dallas police department is but there's no group of people that you can get  ordinary american citizens higher levels is a whore running narcotics trafficking 
[03:13:30]  sure absolutely but then they have to include the warren commission the dallas police department is  the head of the dixie mafia for the entire south of the united states but how do you keep so many  people so many quiet earl warren people said the warren commission from scarface when the cop says  i got 20 killers with badges and when they hit it hurts okay that was a great line from scarface but  that doesn't explain why the chief justice of the supreme court would run a fraudulent operation for  nine months oh really well a lot of the other congressional study find that it was complete 
[03:14:00]  baloney justice earl warren give me a break what study do you mean i'm not sure which one you mean  the other congressional study which one do you mean no they had the commission that wasn't 79 the  house select committee on sat station did not find it was complete the way the reason that what they  said is 95 conspiracy and i'll tell you exactly why they said that they said that because of an  an acoustic expert who heard something which very very much sounds like a fourth shot and i'm just  telling you that was what it was guys can we just stop for just a minute because hold on let me finish 
[03:14:30]  it was it was a fourth shot acoustic for the house select committee on assassination and they said  by nature if there's a fourth shot there's a conspiracy so i do believe you're 95 truthful thing  none of it came from physical or medical evidence hey listen for the sake of argument guys let's do this  so he was cia at secret bases and allowed to go to russia and allowed to defect back when no one  else would be and left alone and so what he had an office in between the cia and fbi new orleans and 
[03:15:00]  so what when he was in boy scouts he was recruited into a pentagon program uh in south texas and let's  just let's just forget all that everything's fine uh the government loves us uh let me just tell you  about some things that are admitted if i may i'm only talking about the acoustic evidence that with that  the uh house select committee on assassination let's just say okay let's just for the sake of argument  let's just say that he was a lone gunman and everything's fine okay all right everything's  yes everything's fine though listen listen you're right let's just say i mean for me the jfk thing 
[03:15:30]  is is a hundred percent inside job and we have so much proof it's it's a ridiculous honestly alex i'm  listening to what you're saying i mean and you make some good points and some very compelling points  but i haven't heard anything that contradicts other evidence that i that i think is strong evidence  all right let me just say this because you have a large audience and it's important for them to know  that i have made 25 films and they're all free 25 films and uh the the important film they need to see 
[03:16:00]  to understand the financial collapse and how it's done by design i made this film over a year ago  and you'll now notice when you watch the obama deception on youtube and google for free uh just google  the obama deception that everything that we cover in the film literally has now happened  i mean i lay out everything obama's going to do because of who put him in power i released the  film a month and a half after he was in office okay people need to go watch for free end game 
[03:16:30]  blueprint for global enslavement end game blueprint for global enslavement because i will show you the  elite i will show you their own writings their own statements they openly state that that they see us  as garbage that has to be taken out that there's too many of us and some can argue that's true but the  point is we're all being targeted and they are putting soft kill binary weapons in the food and  water and degenerative diseases are all off the charts and the u.n has been caught adding live 
[03:17:00]  polio to shots worldwide they've been caught adding live cancer viruses to every major vaccine i have all  their admissions i have cnn from yesterday admitting that there is silicon plastic in the chicken  mcnuggets okay that is a huge bold statement that like you say you have documentation yet  i've never heard of any of this on any other i just gave you the films for free that end game  blueprint for global enslavement sir i earlier when i started the show i mean when you first had me on 
[03:17:30]  uh i gave you john p holdren eco science population resources environment you can search engine eco  science and you'll find ap and reuters admitting that you know white house science czar  under fire for statements about putting sterilants in water uh yes sir what i'm telling you is the  truth and what i'm telling you is it's our i mean i mean look how do we know you're not a  misinformation like almost like you could be very much be a disinformation guy who is throwing out 
[03:18:00]  uh crazy things to take the focus i'm not saying you are but you understand what i mean  here's the deal here's the deal trust but verify i'm begging people to just simply in fact jaron  you're out there i can't remember the exact headline we're lining them up again uh uh top epa scientists  say fluoride deadly will you print me some mainstream articles on that or give me that press release  here's the issue i had them on in 2000 i had them on in 2005 now they're sending more certified letters  to the epa environmental protection agency scientists fda scientists by the thousands uh epa and fda 
[03:18:30]  top toxicologists uh you name it i mean phds the vast majority he just gave it to me they have come out  with press release after press release and with peer-reviewed papers saying we are the majority  the head of the fda union in 2005 testified before congress you can search engine this you can have  them on your show and they explain that sodium fluoride in one part per million precipitates 
[03:19:00]  into the bones and more than doubles bone cancer in boys some studies quadruples let me continue i just  every organ and is and and is also reduces fertility and uh here here's here's one of the press releases  epa scientists and workers call for an end to water fluoridation because of cancer risk and and it  is a hundred percent a pull it surprise winning okay okay okay i i understand what you're saying 
[03:19:30]  here that that is fact that people can check on here's fact that is absolutely known because we live  it on a daily basis why then is the life expectancy higher than it's been in any other time in history  and keeps getting higher and higher i was going next all right okay  let me answer it i can answer your question in about five minutes uh where is the closest old  cemetery in your area um i don't know but i could find it yeah front of models okay well we my family's 
[03:20:00]  been in texas since 1829 we got mexican land grants and so the joneses the johnsons and the browns  uh all lived in the same area uh all lived in the same area and they intermarried and i can go to  family cemeteries in teague texas in fairfield texas in buffalo texas that are have graves from 1829  1830 and you go there and more up to half of them are you know little missy jones died at six months 
[03:20:30]  uh we love her uh around half of them are kids under the age of 10 most of them just a few months old  and and if you go to a cemetery with people from the 30s 40s and 50s you will find that around 20  percent again that's a rough estimation but a larger percentage of them are children and so  the issue is when you when you average out yes and there's been major studies on this and in fact  i've had people that do actuaries from insurance companies you know on to talk about this when you 
[03:21:00]  average out the life expectancy and and and take out the infant mortality rate because infant mortality  is way down in the entire western world uh i mean a lot of women died in childbirth i mean  cemeteries are full of them you know 15 years old 20 years old women used to get married when they  were 13 yeah and uh good old days yeah well the point is is that is that you go in there there's  a lot of 15 20 year old women a lot of them would die the first time they had a kid and the rest are 
[03:21:30]  dead kids and so women aren't dying in childbirth like they did now you take those out the average  person depending on the year you can look at the actuaries online there's been major harvard studies on  this if you made it past the time you were about 15 the average person lived to be above 80  so now the average male what 74 years the average woman about 76 in russia it's dropped from the 70s  down into the mid 50s and now for the first time our infant mortality is going back up and uh population 
[03:22:00]  is going down now they have more high-tech sciences so they pump the poisons into you and the soft kill  degenerative weapons that take time and and so no one notices it until decades later then they use  high-tech science and expensive drugs now that you're a retiree to suck all the money out of you  in the process of slowly killing you but you can't use harvard as a legitimate source of study like this  and then and then beforehand say that they're basically part of the machine no i was talking 
[03:22:30]  about specifically at the key fraternities of the rich blue bloods at harvard at yale at princeton  specifically being infiltrated and and skull and bones being founded by british intelligence and  why do studies though that that absolutely again if they why do studies that would absolutely  disprove i can go to a cemetery and it's full of dead kids well i'm right i'm right i'm not saying  there's not a lot of dead kids in cemeteries but again why even why even allow that study to be done 
[03:23:00]  there's such simple things that could stop this stuff from coming out this why allow the the institution  to do a study that basically just proves that i mean in 1961 in his farewell address  eisenhower said watch out for the military industrial complex over 90 percent of funding  and universities and studies is now government and more and more they are trying to adulterate  studies and you do have to watch them look all i know is this my taxes are going way up and i can  watch congressional hearings whether it's bush people or obama people and they say where's the 500 
[03:23:30]  billion where's the 800 billion where's the two trillion and the head of the fed the head of  the new york fed the head of the treasury all former goldman sachs people paying themselves bailout  money sit there and say i'm not going to tell you where the two trillion went sit down and shut up  now i know something's wrong with that picture and i'll expand on that i watch henry paulson  with with congressman stern this is in my film the obama deception and congressman stern said i want from 
[03:24:00]  florida said well you know what we know where 218 million went it went to you how did you as the  former head of goldman sachs holding hundreds of millions in goldman stock how did you get a 218  million dollar payment of bailout money you gave aig that it then that you knew was going to pay out  to goldman sachs and he said i got a waiver and congressman stern said who gave you that waiver  and he said i'll tell you who gave me that waiver i did now let me tell you that isn't a conspiracy  that's out in the open raping me and my family and raising all these taxes and getting rid of middle 
[03:24:30]  class tax cuts california raised a bunch of taxes bloomberg reports 46 states are about to go  bankrupt i have the government and banking documents where they plan to bankrupt states they create the  welfare system things go bankrupt the banks come in and loan us fiat money and take over our society  and california knew two years wait they put what documents that says that they plan to to bankrupt  states uh in 2002 i'll just give you one of the big ones that the bbc got greg palace they got imf world 
[03:25:00]  bank documents that are international front consortiums uh for the private central banks  that their u.s consortium front holding company is the is the federal reserve and in those thousands  of pages of documents uh it's called uh in fact one headline it became world news was um imf world  bank documents uh what was that headline imf world bank documents uh it'll pop my head in just a second  imf world bank uh document story uh goes viral i think was one of my headlines and it links over to 
[03:25:30]  the bbc uh but the point is is that in there it's the hundred point plan how they go in how they get  buy off politicians and they take decades to do this how they get the politicians to take big loans from  them then when they don't pay those loans back and they tell them not to then they lose their credit  rating then the loans go up even bigger and take nigeria billion dollar loan 50 plus billion paid back  they still own another 50 billion on 1 billion so they pay 100 billion plus box and never never pay 
[03:26:00]  back the 1 billion yeah but they're giving me 10 million they sent me an email saying that uh  a doctor died and uh i got 10 million from nigeria i got the same email they're giving it back one  citizen at a time let me just tell you something guys look i i please don't believe me please all right  go go look it up for yourself research soft kill weapons research neo eugenics research  sterilants in vaccines uh just search the term un caught adding sterilant to vaccines you'll get 
[03:26:30]  mainstream news please search i mean all right i i do you know instead of individual circumstances and  and uh events and things like that let me just ask you a blanket question is there anything uh any  large events aside from just signing a little shit bill or something like that that the government  does that you actually believe happened the way it happens do you believe in the moon landing do you  believe in um that that the watergate uh uh conspiracy uh which was a conspiracy uh it was actually 
[03:27:00]  played out the way i mean i actually know exactly what happened with both those cases all right deep  research well first let me briefly just put it this way uh most of what happens is real  and is the way we were told but then they'll spin it they're like oh police are taking blood at  warrantless checkpoints under federal grants in texas isn't it good and i take that article and i go  no this is total thuggery the end of the fourth amendment can you imagine in nazi germany if they  were taking blood at checkpoints i mean i mean what have we turned into so so most of the time it's 
[03:27:30]  just out in the open what they're doing i could imagine wait taking the blood i'm not sure you mean i'm  sorry buddy taking the blood what do you mean okay well i mean now under federal grants all over the  country they're setting up random checkpoints and police are now taking blood and i found out  about this six years ago and got the government documents by searching anything you can imagine  the government's doing where are they taking i've never heard i'm not saying you're wrong i've never  heard of it let me tell you not only was i telling people about them taking blood at warrantless  checkpoints before it was news because i got reports of it now it's mainstream news in texas 
[03:28:00]  new york california wait like there'd be a dewee checkpoint type of checkpoint pull up at a  checkpoint right and they got an rv and the cops take your blood i have never heard of that never  heard of that expand on that 15 years ago a nurse in san antonio at a pentagon database who works for  university of texas sent me secret documents saying that all babies since 1972 in a worldwide 
[03:28:30]  program under the un have their blood taken and it's stored uh in the u.s and pentagon and  university databases and and guess what i talked about it for 15 years and now it's cnn ap saying  yeah we got your baby's blood it was taken secretly and yeah the pentagon's got it and yeah cbs news the  government says they now own your dna and your dna uh and they've got computer systems that can track  your entire genome in two minutes individually but but briefly so why aren't they using that like 
[03:29:00]  they're taking they're going through all this stuff to take blood from criminals uh like you know  for rape cases and dna stuff where it actually and in times actually freeze people operation they're  getting you used to it now being harvested like in england at a traffic stop we're we haven't gotten  to that phase yet except for the quote dwi blood blood points but that's actually four databases  they've been covertly doing it okay australia six years ago went into an earlier phase than us  and they went ahead and announced guess what we took everybody's blood at birth part of a un program 
[03:29:30]  and now we're going to use it to fight to solve old murders so what group decided to do this is  what i mean like was australia is doing it the u.s and no one has heard of no one in my experience has  heard of that we have a we have a global government so they all get together and none of them have the  the uh just the the blabbermouth syndrome none of them they're all these perfect working humans who  don't make mistakes they don't make judgment errors gave me this 15 years ago and i i covered it and got  death threats over it and why did i why not just kill you why give you death threats i mean 
[03:30:00]  it doesn't make sense why because if they kill me it makes me a martyr and it underlines and  highlights and puts an exclamation point behind what i said but they made jfk a martyr apparently  if they did jfk a martyr malcolm actually made a martyr because he actually had power and was  threatening him let me well so are you if you're giving out alice honestly i am getting that you're  giving out real information about the moon landing and what was the other one yeah i want to hear about  the moon landing yeah but it was moon landing what was the other one uh the watergate okay  moon landing moon landing i actually have done deep research on this and because i've been 
[03:30:30]  researching this stuff for 20 years on air for 15 and i went out and i would never give people my  opinion until about the last two years uh and that's because a lot of these guys are old and have  heart trouble and raymond teague uh who on record was part of the frontline apollo missions and also  assigned to rca and ran the moon cameras and the sky lab sky lab cameras raymond teague uh engineer 
[03:31:00]  uh he's a electrical engineer before that he was an air force intelligence and uh he'd had a he's had  like eight heart attacks he's got a whole bunch of stents and he came to my office and i've been friends  with him for years he's one of my dad's patients uh dental patients and he said look i may die  anytime he's still alive this is actually two years ago but uh he said i almost died last week  and he said i'm gonna go ahead and tell you and then by the time i got him on air he wouldn't say  at all but i've said it all for my safety and he was shaking when these guys break national security 
[03:31:30]  parameters they start shaking and uh it's just amazing but alex why on your show not to disrespect you but  why on your show go go now raymond teague and you can see him in photos in fact i showed this on my tv  show slash you know uh radio show you just google alex jones raymond teague and you know photos of him  on the front line he wasn't the second or third backup unit because they had whole whole ground crews he 
[03:32:00]  was on the front crew for apollo and sky lab running the moon cameras he said we went to the moon  uh and and this is intel i'd gotten from others from years ago who'd been researching it but and  i got other direct sources when i went public with this when he went public he said we went to the moon  he said but the van allen radiation belt was frying all the film and they needed for pr  and for public relations information they needed to show people some some cool color photos 
[03:32:30]  there were basically other spacecraft on the moon um we we have more advanced spacecraft a more advanced  technological system uh than what the public's told and that's basically all he would say  and uh he said he said look we were on the moon i was running the rca cameras uh and there's a lot  more going on that you don't know about and he said it's all highly compartmentalized and he said he  wasn't even sure about this at the time but other nasa people told him this so this is the guy running 
[03:33:00]  cameras on the moon okay raymond teague ran the cameras on the moon for rca period okay yes we  went to the moon all right went to the moon but the pictures aren't all real those big lavish beautiful  color photos with you know with the distance hash marks that are behind rocks or behind things and  and and flags that are waving well they've been they've plenty explanations about those but  well i'm just telling you i know that that was listen you cannot even in the little thin  lead shielding cases they had go through the van allen radiation belt i mean you know what happens 
[03:33:30]  whenever uh they in sky lab or the international space station when a solar storm comes up when  there's a electromagnetic uh release in one of those coriolis flares they have to get behind the  water tanks yeah they turn the and it's still very dangerous and uh it shows it's really hurting the  astronauts just like airline pilots have a lot of health problems because they're at 35 000 feet  33 000 feet and uh there's about 10 feet of water if you condensed it down between uh you know ground 
[03:34:00]  level sea level and 30 000 feet and so much of the shielding that is there from the water that's in  the atmosphere isn't there at 30 000 feet and above and so it's also frying the airline pilot how are  buzz aldrin michael collins uh and and neil armstrong still alive there if it was uh if it was it was a  very bad dose of radiation well i mean they're uh very good uh genetic specimens they did swing around  and they did time their moon shots four times when the sun was not very active i mean we didn't have 
[03:34:30]  any coriolis storms in the last three years and suddenly they're back with a vengeance i mean there  haven't been any sunspots and that's a coriolis uh flare ejection uh in uh in three years now how are  their pictures now from uh uh the shuttle and the uh space station they're digital they're on hard  drives they're on digital chips they're not film they're not 35 and 70 millimeter okay i mean look  i'm telling you what raymond teague at nasa said okay what about watergate you said that yeah okay 
[03:35:00]  watergate uh was a setup nixon had been used but he was acting as the president he'd made deals with  china uh he'd gone along basically everything the globalists wanted uh but uh he was doing a few  things they didn't like and they wanted to move their agenda on so they wanted to damage the office  of the presidency they'd already politically i mean they'd already physically assassinated uh jfk  now they wanted to politically assassinate and weaken the image of the presidency to further the 
[03:35:30]  power of the bureaucracy and the strong men that are around the president that's why they only get  people who are compromised like george w bush or barack obama now who have all these skeletons in  their closet and so that's why he was set up from within and the plumbers were basically set up from  within uh that's the word i've gotten from a lot of good sources and what the evidence shows  we know there's deep throat inside the white house yeah yeah well that was uh it was alexander haig and a  compositive alexander uh haig and of course um hair kissinger but uh hair kissinger but you think 
[03:36:00]  nixon was uh what you're saying is nixon was just kind of a a setup there he was uh he wasn't as  involved as uh as they said in the end no nixon it's on the tapes i mean nixon was in there uh and  that you know talk about digging a hole for your enemies and you fall into it uh or setting a trap for  your enemies and you get caught by it he was recording everybody and you know there he is on the 
[03:36:30]  tapes going bohemian grove north of san francisco most goddamn faggy thing you've ever seen all right  in their orgies i mean oh the rituals and of course helmut schmidt german chancellor wrote about that  as well oh i love the satanic rituals we do in uh in in germany but i love the ones at the grove i  i enjoy it what was the reason what was the reason for getting nixon out uh it was about damaging they  were done with him it was about a sacrifice but he had what i have what two years left it was about  damaging the image of the presidency oh okay it was about lowering morale for what purpose 
[03:37:00]  to demoralize people uh to to they had problems with presidents trying to be presidents  and so it's about making them be these uh you know kept creatures i mean let's go back three thousand  years ago to the chin what china is named after today and they would come to the elites you know  the king and the queen these would be the grandchildren these would be the grandchildren  well i mean to understand what's happening currently got to understand the the of the past 
[03:37:30]  the grandchildren of the war chief who'd unified china who'd actually been tough and intelligent  the grandchildren were little spoiled brats and so the king's court uh you know the wise men would  come and say uh you know emperor um you need to grow your fingernails out to about two feet long  you're too godlike to feed yourself and we must have a groom with a stool of course you know the  british royals have their butts wiped as well and and so it's all about controlling them and oh we must  bind your feet you must be carried you're not allowed to touch the ground and actually what it does 
[03:38:00]  is it makes them these kept creatures uh who are controlled by the power behind the throne and so this  was a similar 20 20th century or 21st century model of uh what the aztecs did to their ruling elite  to turn them into kept creatures uh and what the british did i mean you know about room of the  stool right i mean you know the queen of england has her butt wiped right uh i didn't know that still  went on yeah oh yeah well i mean they they officially got rid of it about uh 90 years ago but no they 
[03:38:30]  they still uh they still have a toilet attendant it's normally a high-level government official  oh see that was bush had george w had a room of the stool uh where they have a special toilet and  then they examine his feces oh yeah and that's just something for your show i know that's something  you're listening now is that i've heard that is that uh to see no that's associated press i mean  no no i mean i've heard that is the purpose of that things have always been examined is the purpose of  that to see if he's sick or to see uh food allergies right that stuff to see where his health is yes and 
[03:39:00]  and and his crap is also national security i mean for the last 50 years they've had a special toilet  but they just admitted it under bush to humiliate him further uh but yes uh well they claim that  foreign governments might get in the sewers to get his poop uh to find out what he is uh what drugs  he's using he was a well-known drug addict yeah alex to bring it to current times here the oil spill  is there any conspiracy uh there that's starting to the entire the entire thing is 100 a staged event 
[03:39:30]  from pillar to post i could give you the end of the breakdown of that if you'd like uh i guess give us  give us some basic this is keeping obama kept right uh yes yeah yes this is how they're grooming  his stool what do you got what do you got on the oil spill just the basic uh folks well hey you guys  if you get powerful enough maybe you can have a groom of the stool huh yeah of that i've paid to be  one that's true you'd like to uh groom uh the queen elizabeth uh no not not after 1958 when she 
[03:40:00]  started to get a little fucking long in the tooth when she was young and fixing automobiles i would  have eaten her ass sure i mean you notice you notice that uh yes hey you notice that uh she uh  is queen elizabeth the second okay yes yeah yeah yeah number two number two see one oven roman  as the romans talk about some poop with you guys all right listen alex what this will be a youtube 
[03:40:30]  classic no no seriously the oil spill the oil spill let's go all right all right let me get out of  this mode for a moment and get serious hold on one second in fact you guys talk for a second let me  let me actually pull up those files in my mind go on oh is that what he has to do no he's googling  something mind file he's googling something he's googling something okay yeah here we go would you  like me to go over the information yes let's please alex okay let's set the stage here with  what's happening with the oil spill let's go back to the week before the ceo of british petroleum 
[03:41:00]  he'd just been replaced the former chairman and ceo uh had been the chairman of goldman sachs  simultaneously the most powerful uh shareholder in the worldwide private central bank cartel  always at the scene speak of the devil he shall appear the ceo of goldman sachs they dump 44 percent 
[03:41:30]  uh the week before the oil spill uh you have the ceo of bp separately dumping over a third of his  this is all mainstream news uh you have vanguard that holds the majority of barack obama's millions  and mutual fund money uh that was fully dumped the week before fully dumped talk about insider  training uh and and and they weren't dumping uh specifically other big central banks are on record  now uh dumping their stock not of other oil companies but of bp specifically again isn't this 
[03:42:00]  very obvious yeah it goes back to that obvious question why not do it uh way before the actual  because they don't care their religion is about doing it right out in front of you now now but  that's how they acclimate your subconscious mind they know your subconscious mind is thousands of  times more powerful than your conscious mind in your subconscious right now you know the truth in  your gut you know the truth you know things aren't right in the world you know you're being lied to 
[03:42:30]  you know things are getting worse so yes there but as long as your subconscious can be told something  and in plain view it feels comfortable as if it's in power and so there isn't anxiety in knowing  that's probably why they let me do what i do they think little of you i think more of you and they  think this is just going to acclimate you and and as known as revelation of the method but let me  continue to run why make trouble for themselves by allowing you to do it this like there's so there's  so easy ways to stop you from saying what you say again freedom of information all these little 
[03:43:00]  little things they could do to make their lives astronomically easier i'm sorry let me answer  that briefly and then get back into okay you know try not to be long-winded because i am long-winded  and just give you the basic on on the goldman sachs coup in the gulf okay um but this is the issue  i've studied it 50 years ago uh 40 years ago 30 years ago they would kill you better than a hammer  people wrote books about this stuff they would get beaten to death on their way to the grocery store 
[03:43:30]  in a small town they'd get run over they'd be killed they'd die of a you know uh 12 hour cancer  and it's now been declassified that they did have cancer weapons programs and you know it uh but but  side issue now if they now there's so many people out here speaking out that they found that when they  smash us flatter into pancake and when they kill us it only uh hurts them more now they are starting  to prosecute whistleblowers they didn't do that in the past you know pentagon whistleblower releases video  of troops killing kids and laughing in baghdad they're you know they're charging that guy with 
[03:44:00]  felonies and they're trying to hunt down even msnbc reported that that there were kill orders for the  guy that released the pentagon papers daniel ellsberg and there may be kill orders for the head of  wikileaks so so if you're releasing original bombshell you know prima facie uh bullet points that will  hurt them uh they tend to kill your ass dead in a hammer if you don't release it first once you  release it you're safe uh so that's why they haven't killed me they have tried to buy me off 
[03:44:30]  and things like that now they've tried to buy you off absolutely who's tried to buy you off well i  mean i do wear a journalist hat and when a company or a group comes to me and says you know this is  off record and i've even signed a non-disclosure in one case i mean when somebody comes to you and  says you know we're going to give you this proposal and you give us your word it won't you know be on  the record but i mean i've had major radio networks in the past and others come to me and say i mean  one more than 10 years ago i was and they offered me a 15 times what i was making and then so why 
[03:45:00]  wouldn't you reveal who they were if you're revealing government stuff that could be why not  why not expose these people because i have honor that's not honor though you're helping them i don't i  don't mess with people's families i don't call for people to mess with politicians or globalist  families because i don't want my families messed with it's the rules of war but if somebody comes  to you and and and and offers you a deal and says it's off record uh and unless it's criminal it's  off record so you would honor these people who are helping to perpetuate to keep these things going 
[03:45:30]  that you're fighting you know what you know a radio vice president or a radio president and these  things have all changed hands you know it's different people today you know it's like oh yeah there's a  world government but it's for the good of everything alex and you know we've got to lower the standard  living here to help the third world and i mean i've heard the speech repeatedly so somebody came  to you with that smart guy the general public will tear you apart you belong with the elite you're a  smart guy no more black helicopters no more federal reserve you'll replace rush limbaugh and we'll 
[03:46:00]  develop a tv i was offered basically to be glenn beck before glenn beck was even on the radar so why  wouldn't you take that job and then use their own uh duplicitousness against them honorable they've  they've been given intelligence files on me so that's honorable hold on they know i'm for real  they know i'm not going to sell out boys they know i'm not going to go on there and sell out i'm not  going to change what i say i can't control what i say so wait they offered you these big gigs and all  this money and on your honor you're not revealing who they are and you didn't take it to use that 
[03:46:30]  platform because you're making films for free which to me i didn't sign contracts they told me  no they told me they said we will you will have editorial control you will have a couple of  producers and we will bring you what you're going to cover and you're not going to cover  i mean this happened repeatedly it was like a script no more black helicopters no more fellow  reserve no one and this happened three different times one time it was a little radio guy you know  a national consultant then it was a vice president then it was even higher level i mean come on guys so 
[03:47:00]  you fight against here's the deal hold on you fight against declassifying stuff here's the deal  you fight against declassifying stuff and yet you're helping classify all my way i'm doing it my way  and i'm getting it all but why not then help bring them down here's how you make yourself bigger  is you bring them down through their own their if they come to you with these type of deals  and they come to you by law free some radio guy who knows the truth and and because he is a part of  what you're fighting no he's not he's serious let me tell you something why would he be privy to the 
[03:47:30]  information i talk to radio executives now and i mean people that are good friends with  rush limbaugh and glenn beck and people like that i talk to radio execs now who know i'm a good guy  and i don't burn people and they tell me let me tell you the truth these guys have all got bodyguards  and know the new order is real and we thought you were a kook 10 years ago and we're scared and a lot  of people want to leave the country so they came to a known kook quote unquote these radio ceos aren't bad  alex they came to a known kook they came to a guy like you and they just trusted you and they said 
[03:48:00]  look we can we're going to tell you what we're telling you we're going to put our careers and our jobs  on the line by offering you this gigantic salary instead of just leaving you guys i'm on the cover of  radio inc i didn't get back with talkers to be on the cover last week because i was too busy i mean  they recognize talent you think i'm making i'm not saying you're not talented i think hold on hold on  you think i'm making this stuff up i think you're making up the part about them offering you a lot  of money movies guys my websites combined are starting to approach the drudge report i mean 
[03:48:30]  they recognize talent they came and they said listen kid you got talent and they said you want to be on  a crusade and basically go nowhere or not be sure going somewhere or do you want to go to the big time  right now kid i would believe that they offered you a job and said look we would like you to change  your format we like you but not what you're talking about that i would believe but you're saying  you sign confidentiality clauses as far as them believing in the new world order you're implying  that it's something like the new world order and they're somehow a part of it they're going hey 
[03:49:00]  come with us i was repeatedly given speeches that because these guys don't want you to think they're  dumb they're like yeah there is global government you know but it's so do you think that they were a  part of it and believed it or were just appeasing you to try to get you to say two different things  that could have been it okay well that's kind of different than what you were saying that's all i'm  telling you well i mean look gee it sucks you in slow but the devil doesn't come and just tell you  everything that is evil and then hold you to your honor to not tell everybody else hollywood people 
[03:49:30]  i know a lot of hollywood people i've never really reached out to them they've all reached out to me  and and i have been with some of the most powerful people in hollywood i mean some of them  you wouldn't believe i mean i'm talking about colin quinn no i'm talking about i'm not i'm talking about  the biggest lawyers in hollywood i'm talking about some of the biggest producers i'm talking about  people that have made billions of dollars i'm talking about above brad pitt level okay i'm  talking about the highest level we get it they all know this stuff's real okay all right let's get a 
[03:50:00]  bunch of all know and they're scared and they want to break the order you know what i woke up bruce  willis i can talk about that because rick link letters talked about it okay did a movie with him yeah  well the point is bruce willis you know was basically a right-wing neocon until he saw my  films when he was here making a movie uh in austin three years ago and i wasn't even going to talk  about it then rick link letter came on my show and said yeah i woke up bruce willis with your videos  he said now he understands the new world order and how both parties are controlled and then bruce  willis a few months later gave a vanity fair interview and he said yes i no longer am basically 
[03:50:30]  the way i was uh the same people that killed kennedy are the ones running america today  it's a world government but i'd love to sit and have a debate with bruce willis i don't say that  you have in turn people that don't believe you you're not a smart guy but i do find it difficult  to believe bruce willis i don't know i do find it difficult to believe that they would come and  just offer you people that run entire studios that know know their waters why do they trust you  enough alex to tell you this stuff when what you do is talk about this stuff for a living 
[03:51:00]  because because it's known that i don't that somebody says this is in confidence it's  in confidence you know you're a man of honor and people respect that so why would they betray  themselves and put everything they have on the line to talk to let's be honest unknown blabbermouth  well you know what i am someone of a bladder blabbermouth on the radio but in person i it's it's more  electric i mean so you're saying that if somebody gives you these facts which in a way i don't know  why people tell me things when you sit out on a veranda overlooking the hollywood hills 
[03:51:30]  uh you know talking to somebody you get real with them and look them right in the eye and say you  know this is going to destroy your grandchildren you know this you know this program is real you  understand the true power structure if you're respecting your confidentiality humanities people  say yes i know what are we supposed to do so well you should be exposing those people that you're  exposing other people you can't expose people but not expose people who are just nice to you in  person format it's not like i'm out running around doing this in the last you know decade i mean 
[03:52:00]  this might have happened to me 10 12 13 times all right well that's a lot that's a lot of names  i'm wallowing around in these i mean i could go out there and try to ingratiate myself more but i  haven't even attempted that that's a lot of names 13 people you say you said big radio heads had come  to you and offered to pay you 10 times what you were making just a number 10 15 times have i ended up in  super high powered meetings and events and and seeing things so you're saying that people who knew  there was a new world order not just believed it and were being uh what do you think it's like if 
[03:52:30]  i'm right being near the top and knowing how evil this plan is i think that none of them who really  believe that or thought that would come to you and admit that they knew or thought that and expect you  to not talk about okay one time here's an example one time probably 11 years ago i was up at the texas  capital and i was walking out of a bathroom and up walked one of the heads i'll just leave it at  that of the government of texas and he stuck a card in my hand he said you ought to come by for a 
[03:53:00]  meeting sometime and he goes listen everything you're saying is true but the public's a bunch  of idiots and they and they don't want freedom you'll come by my office sometime and i ended up  losing the card never coming by his office because i'm busy the point is these guys wait hold on you  you were too busy to go by a man in that powerful positions like you interview a guy who who ran the  film for the moon and i know you do a lot of compelling interviews why would you blow that  off or why would you protect his name when this is a guy you could put a a face to the theory because 
[03:53:30]  i could tell by what he said in that two minute conversation was they wanted to you know basically  offer me something or try to it's all about influence all about network so you wouldn't go and just  try to somehow uh engage that man and learn what you could know i'm saying all this all the stories  i just told you are stuff that fell in my lap right so why not why why do extra googling i'm doing i'm  doing two interviews today i got a four-hour radio show coming up in an hour and a half uh i'm i'm 
[03:54:00]  working on a film on bioweapons and chemical weapons and the food and water supply that's scaring the  hell out of me i mean i've got all just so a very powerful guy in the texas government came to you  admitting that you're right but you were too busy no he didn't really he didn't really you know he  said you're right about all this but your perspective's wrong it's always the same with  these guys it's yes yes there's an elite yes this yes it's corrupt yes it's out of control but you  don't understand the people don't want freedom and and and and and if they had the power they'd be 
[03:54:30]  just as bad all right i think you gotta wrap up we have 15 minutes to show left before the computer  well the oil spill thing though oh because that's a current you want to hear the oil spill well you got  to make it fast because we really got to get out we run out of show so everyone hold on hold on  we where we were at everyone dumped their stock a week before the the big event yes i mean obama  dumped his stock the head of bp the head of goldman sachs which is one of the main owners of british  petroleum they all dump it and then i started getting this report we're 70 something days into it but  within a week uh there were news reports just because people would talk to folks in the in the oil 
[03:55:00]  drilling community in mississippi and louisiana and then about a month ago they had the uh coast guard  hearings with the survivors and the survivors said look two months before they gave us orders to drill  this super deep well at 18 000 feet uh that had never been done before and we told them it was going  to blow up this is this is this is an atlantic monthly by the way the minutes of this and a bunch  of other publications the atlantic monthly headline was are you effing happy i told you the rig uh was 
[03:55:30]  going to effing blow in fact will you print me that because that's the sub headline and so the the the  anadarko and halliburton engineers said it's going to blow up uh you can't dump seawater into this before  we've capped it with cement and mud it's coming in with incredible pressure and they gave them orders  to do something they knew would blow up and then it indeed did blow up uh and then we expand why would  british petroleum do this well the globalists have to sacrifice even a pawn or a rook in a gambit 
[03:56:00]  uh to win this game i mean this is chess and this is an important sacrifice they can just change the  name of the company as bp's done uh over and over again and bp is the top funder the top funder  after goldman sachs and harvard of obama the number three uh contributor uh they fund they are the top  funder of billboards radio ads uh global carbon tax garbage they bullied the rest of the oil industry 
[03:56:30]  into it they've made their deals through government cartels they get 80 of the oil under federal law  that comes out of alaska with those pipelines they send it to asia their top globalists their entire  carbon tax failed when the climate gate emails came out and when the text of the new global treaty came  out that oil taxes gas taxes at the wellhead at the pump bed in your home on natural gas would all be  paid to goldman sachs jp morgan chase and others on record in this new global consortium a new global  government with a global constitution run by private banks issuing their own cashless sdr that's 
[03:57:00]  mainstream news herman von rumpe head of the eu gordon brown uh former head of the britain talking about  ban kai moon head of the un this is the plan open world government run by the banks the ponzi scheme  operators i mean madoff founded the nasdaq i mean this is a 600 trillion dollar conservative uh even the  washington post submitted that two days ago 600 trillion dollar derivative so they've got to have  this new global tax this new global energy tax that they can then sell derivatives on so they get tax 
[03:57:30]  money then they also monetize uh the carbon credits they own hundreds of billions of dollars in carbon  credits bp owns over 50 billion dollars conservatively leverage through fractional  reserve banking it's five times that uh sometimes they go all the way up to 10 times depending on  how they leverage but they don't tend to leverage over five times uh with uh derivatives on uh cap and  trade credits obama al gore they all totally invested in it chicago mercantile new york stock exchange 
[03:58:00]  all of this is going on so they've got to have so the day it happened i said if it's staged this is  before i knew they gave orders to blow the well that they knew would cause it this is before i  understood all that i said if obama comes out and says i want the carbon tax to to fix this and to  pay for this on all americans we know this is a staged event and sure enough he comes out and says the  answer to it is that then on top of it for 70 plus days what are we almost into day 80 uh right now i  mean day 79 71 uh i mean i mean it's incredible i mean let's do the math uh alex alex i'm not to be

[03:59:00]  good crisis go to waste so any way you cut it they are using this to pass their global tax to  financially conquer us and we cover it all in infowars.com all right and uh let's say alex let's  you can hear him uh 165 talk radio saturday 6 to 9 p.m that's only on xm and it's infowars.com  and prison planet one word prison planet dot tv weekdays 11 a.m to 3 p.m sundays 4 to 6 p.m

[04:00:00]  of it but uh you're you're a very compelling guy and you make great points and uh you know i would  i would love to listen to your show you absolutely get people thinking there alex hey i converted joe  rogan i mean i'm when i knew joe 12 years ago uh you know when he'd come and visit in austin  he didn't believe anything yeah joe is very easy to convert all you gotta do is throw a  fucking hash brownie in his face joe is really smart we love joe no we love joe alex we'd like  to make jokes here you didn't pick up on many of the jokes today but i bet joe can kick your ass in  mine all right i like to see him do that yeah that is true i'll let me tell you i'll slap joe in the

[04:01:00]  all right all right all right jones everyone he was an interesting guy man i mean uh get you  thinking i don't agree with it uh like because people were saying well is he going to be at the  borgata july 2nd and 3rd and i'm like why would he be there this weekend i was just gonna ask jimmy  norton will be there though but he was uh yeah there's a lot of that stuff that it's just like  you go like i i'm exhausted i'm exhausted well it was there's certain things like i i didn't like 
[04:01:30]  the way the we we were kind of keep getting away from i want to harp on the assassination but the  house select command assassinations or he didn't want to talk about whatever he's a smart dude and  by the way jimmy was very very good with with like he was tripping up on a few things he was  contradicting himself uh and jimmy was very good at pointing that out but it's not to say that he's  a phony i don't think he is i think he's very smart my only thing is got a job to do yes he's got a  gig let's let's be serious i don't fucking i don't leave here and i'm not completely the uh you know 
[04:02:00]  from the radio show believe me but but to me any conspiracies like whenever you point out certain  things i almost never hear conspiracy theories guys go oh yeah that's a good point you know i  didn't think that like yeah that does make it more sense to do this way there's always they always  have to again because the agenda becomes a conspiracy and their whole thing is i have to prove the  conspiracy conspiracy is more important than the event than the events of what happened the idea of  conspiracy becomes more important than the event and and a lot of these conspiracy guys are so hung up 
[04:02:30]  on the gulf of tonkin incident and yes it happened but it doesn't necessarily mean that every time we  go to war there has been some type of government-run conspiracy event to get us into it yeah um you  know i'm i'm sure there are behind the scenes shit that goes on that we'll never know about but uh  you know they take one instance and then it has to mean every time something happens that instance is 
[04:03:00]  the benchmark for it no i just don't believe and again that certain people would risk everything  to cover up certain things some people i'm sure would but the mass level of these conspiracies to  me is what trips them up because i don't care how black ops they are they're people and on on a  certain level you can't get you can't get people to keep those kind of secrets world-changing  secrets you're not going to get groups of people exactly that's the biggest argument i have  what he's saying about goldman sachs and a lot of these scumbags and banking i have a much easier 
[04:03:30]  time believing a lot of that there you go well we should thank um uh alex was enjoyable though i  enjoyed talking to him i thought it was man cow no oh yeah a lot of people said man cow bubble the  love sponge maxwell who was that guy yeah he does kind of sound like a radio guy boys right  alex jones very enjoyable guy a nice guy all right let's chop chop out of here we'll see you guys  bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye </pre>
