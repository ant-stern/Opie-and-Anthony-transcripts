<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a surprising introduction by Larry King, followed by the hosts discussing listener-provided homeopathic remedies.  Opie then recounted a thrilling yet "skeevy" rat-hunting escapade in New York City, describing unusually large rodents and their established trails. This led to a conversation about the replacement of a rock station with a sports talk station, prompting criticism of the declining rock radio landscape and SiriusXM's internal financial matters.  A news story about a bear mauling a teenage girl, heard over the phone by her mother, was followed by a discussion and viewing of a clip from the documentary "Stainless Steel," featuring a strongman, possibly an acquaintance of one of the hosts.  The hosts then heavily criticized Christine O'Donnell's performance in a contentious interview with Piers Morgan, where she dodged questions about gay marriage and ultimately stormed off.  Jim Norton concluded this portion by narrating a recent stand-up performance where he successfully confronted a heckler.  Upcoming guests were announced: Florentine, Andrew Dice Clay, and members of the Jersey Shore cast, including Uncle Nino.

The show continued with a lengthy, sexually explicit "F.U. Line" segment, followed by details of a "prostitution contest" offering $1000 to a woman for a date with Bobo.  Numerous photos of contestants were reviewed with sexually suggestive commentary.  Jim Florentine joined, contributing to the discussion.  Callers then shared graphic descriptions of medical procedures involving urethral cameras, leading to explicit and humorous anecdotes.  The conversation touched upon Florentine's and Opie's comedy careers, driving habits, and speculation about the sexuality of 80s wrestlers.  The "prostitution contest" remained a topic of conversation throughout this segment.


The show then tackled allegations of sexual harassment within the WWF in the early 1990s.  Graphic details of alleged sexual encounters between Pat Patterson and ring boys were recounted by the hosts and a caller, Tom Cole.  A clip from the Phil Donahue show was played, showing an accuser, Murray Hodgson, confronting Vince McMahon about the allegations.  Hodgson claimed he was fired for refusing to sleep with Patterson. McMahon denied specific knowledge but acknowledged the possibility of harassment.  Tom Cole then alleged sexual harassment by Mel Phillips and Terry Garvin, providing specific details.  The hosts speculated on McMahon's motivations for the Donahue interview, considering the concurrent steroid scandal.

Vinny and Uncle Nino from Jersey Shore then joined as guests.  They discussed Uncle Nino's wine, a police stop for lacking an EZ Pass, their experiences filming Jersey Shore (including Vinny's departure from Season 5), interactions with fans, and the fallout from Abercrombie & Fitch's attempt to distance itself from the show.


The next segment opened with criticism of Abercrombie & Fitch's marketing.  The conversation shifted to the Jersey Shore cast, specifically Dina (graphic details of her behavior, including an accidental exposure incident) and JWoww's weight loss.  Numerous crude jokes and sexually explicit anecdotes followed, focusing on pubic hair and oral sex.  Uncle Nino heavily participated, sharing offensively stereotypical jokes.  Jim Florentine promoted his podcast.  Vinny offered brief comments.  Roland, a guest who became increasingly intoxicated, joined in the crude humor.  Kenya, a female employee, briefly joined, leading to more sexually suggestive banter.  The segment ended with more jokes, including one involving a blind date and a dog.


A highly informal and sexually explicit conversation followed, featuring Vinny Guadagnino, Uncle Nino, and Dina. The main topics were sex, dating, and relationships, with frequent crude jokes and anecdotes.  Vinny's dating life was heavily discussed, along with a potential conflict between Roland and Colin Kane. Uncle Nino continued with off-color jokes.  Dina's interview was laced with sexual innuendo and crude humor.  Roland's drinking habits were also discussed, leading to further jokes and anecdotes.  The segment concluded with plugs for guests' appearances and the announcement of returning interns.  The final segment involved post-show discussions among remaining staff and a search for absent guests.


The after-show briefly discussed radio station YSP's format change on September 6th, speculating on the fate of personalities like Danny Bonaduce.  The lifting of Chad Dukes' ban and the upcoming Ron and Fez show were mentioned.  Rob Cross's possible drinking was briefly noted.  Promotional information for the show's Facebook page and broadcast times concluded the segment, followed by an unrelated comment about a "virus".  No guests were present during this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King, welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show, right here on SiriusXM's Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it, the thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony Radio Show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Take the fuck out of here, that ain't happening.  I don't even hate those fucking people saying.  We're opening up our daily gifts from you lunatics.  Oh God, are you people out of your birds?  Kids, this guy wants me to give my kid pediatric oral drops.  You know, it's nice enough that he, I guess he has a company where he's got basic, what do you call it, homeopathic medicines. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, it's homeopathic medicine.  Mine is pediatric oral drops for, ready for this?  Restlessness, teething problems, minor infections with or without fever.  I'm supposed to give him some of these drops?  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, you like, to get something from listeners and give it to your kid?  That seems a little... 
[00:01:30]  I mean, thank you and all, and it is in a legit box and stuff.  But you should remember that, you know, people's kids are pretty precious to them, for the most part, unless you're Casey Anthony.  But, you know, you're not going to be taking the old eyedropper out and squeezing those into the kid's mouth.  It's Heel Incorporated.  I never heard of it.  Yeah, he doesn't sleep well at night, so I'm supposed to give him a drop of Vibra Call.  What the hell is Vibra Call in the homeopathic world?  I got some, what'd you get, Ant? 
[00:02:00]  Vibra.  I got the Nux Vamica Home Accord.  It's for relief of nausea and vomiting, dyspepsia, and bloating and constipation.  I don't have fucking shit problems.  Well, you're talking about icky stomachs every once in a while.  Oh, if I have a tummy ache.  I think he's picking up on little clues that we...  Is that it? 
[00:02:30]  How about if you want to give a...  Someone goes, sounds like Ant bloated and full of shit.  Ah, follow...  That's funny.  Look, we're pretty much gods at this, at this point, so if you want to give us a gift, make it easy.  I like wine.  I like really nice bottles of red wine.  Yes.  I will be your best fucking friend.  Of course I have to go to wine.com.  Keep that in mind.  Yeah, we will look.  There's homeopathic medicine.  What the fuck?  But what is this?  This is heel medicine, like anti-inflammatory and a gel-sick. 
[00:03:00]  I think I'll try the...  Or analgesic.  Sore throat, hoarseness, canker sores I'll take for sore throats.  You got canker sores?  No, but I mean, it covers all three.  I don't have canker sores.  Oh.  And this is...  Would you like one?  I have cankel sores.  Would you like one?  I certainly would not.  You sure?  Yes.  I wasn't sure you heard me.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  This is for the temporary relief of muscle pain and joint pain, which I get when I finally  get my fat-titted body to the gym.  Aw.  I won't use the heel stuff.  What am I going to use the heel stuff for?  Maybe just give this to one of the wrestlers, you know? 
[00:03:30]  What is it?  James, me and you after Labor Day.  I haven't been to the fucking gym in a month.  I've been...  Oh, shit.  I've been going, but not as much.  Well, I've gone, but just very here and there, I got to get back into a fucking routine,  man.  Jesus H.  Christ.  I almost called you last night.  Why?  I freaked out a lot of people, because I tweeted that I'm going rat hunting.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's one of my pastimes.  Yeah.  Every once in a while, you find out about a spot in New York City.  Because some asshole goes, oh, really?  Rats in New York?  Fuck you. 
[00:04:00]  They're giant ones, like bunny rabbit size.  Thank you.  There was an article in the paper.  Every once in a while, New York City will let you know there's a hot spot of activity.  Hot spot.  It's not like they're all over New York, but there's hot spots.  If you look hard enough, you're going to see a rat in New York, of course.  But when you hear...  Fucking whole family's rats.  When you hear of a fucking hot spot of activity, that fucking gets my juices going.  I got Roland to go.  I filmed some shit.  It's not worth making a video, unfortunately.  But we're sitting around, waiting for these rats to come out, because the article said, 
[00:04:30]  oh, they come out when less people are walking around and when the sun goes down.  So I'm sitting there like a lunatic.  It's like the sun's going down.  I'm like fucking waiting.  Then I'm talking to the horse carriage guys.  They're all Russian mobsters that'll fucking slit your throat if you say the wrong fucking  thing, by the way.  I learned a lot last night.  These guys don't fucking play.  They're all crazy fucking rookies.  I go up to them, so they think I'm a tourist because they've got a camera, and I'm asking  about the rats.  And the guy was really fucking annoyed that I wasn't looking for a horse carriage ride. 
[00:05:00]  And said a few things like, ah, they're only fucking rats, and then walked away really  mad.  I'm like, whoa, what's up with this?  Wow.  So then we're sitting around the plaza and waiting and waiting, and this is a true story.  Also, we saw a couple little baby rats.  They just started to fucking-  Little ones.  Started to come out a little bit.  The little ones.  And I got it on film if you want to see, but it's just a rat.  Yeah, all right?  And then another half hour goes by, and then there are a little bigger rats, okay? 
[00:05:30]  Another half hour goes by.  All of a sudden, me and Roland see two fucking rats that look like kangaroos.  Oh, jeez.  These things were fucking huge.  Just hopping across the lawn and jumping in a bush.  So then we start looking closer, and there's actually rat trails, okay, leading from the  bush.  Because what they need to do, actually, there's brush, and then there's this bush, and then  there's a lawn in between.  And you can see the trail they've made. 
[00:06:00]  Because if you know anything about rats, they're creatures of habit.  They use trails.  They don't fuck around.  They know their trails, and they know they're safe.  So all of a sudden, you see this hole from the brush.  Clearly, like, the rats are going in and out of that.  And then a trail across the lawn, like a bike went, you know, across the lawn, but no fucking  bike is on this lawn.  It's where the rats are going from the brush into this bush.  Now they're close to the sidewalk to get the horse feed that they desperately want. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, okay.  That's what they're after.  So the rats started getting bigger and fucking bigger.  And I swear to God, the hair on the back of my neck went fucking crazy.  Heebie-jeebies.  I filmed some shit, but I need a plan.  But I saw 10 to 12 rats.  Yeah.  Easily.  Easily.  Jesus.  And they say it gets so bad, but you got to get there.  You got to be there late.  I'm thinking around midnight.  They say that whole brush area just moves.  There's so many fucking rats in there.  Yeah.  Is there a way to put a little camera down, like, right next to the trail? 
[00:07:00]  That's what I was thinking.  And get them, like, boom.  That's what I want.  Just whizzing right past the camera.  That would be cool as fuck.  See, you're thinking like I am.  I didn't have a plan, unfortunately.  Because a lot of times, I would see a rat, but my camera wasn't on.  And these fuckers, like, they are moving.  They're quick.  Except for the two that were hopping across the lawn.  Hopping.  Like kangaroos.  That is some creepy shit.  That shit creeps me out.  But it's a perfect place to check out rats because they have, like, these cement benches. 
[00:07:30]  So you can actually be up about two feet.  But we saw another one jump.  Jump about two feet over this little, like, you can't call it a fence.  It's like a little garden fence, I guess.  It's like two feet high.  This fucker.  Because I was walking toward one of the benches, and it was under it, I guess.  And jumped up and over and back into the brush.  Oh, man.  I wanted to bring Jimmy, because he's told the rat hunting stories from the past.  You and Voss.  I haven't gotten rat-looking in a long time. 
[00:08:00]  It's something you do in New York, man.  I'm telling you.  It is kind of fun to do.  But it's fucking skeevy.  Yeah.  And there was a smell there.  And Roland's like, that's just horse manure.  I'm like, no.  No.  It's not.  Did you film them?  Huh?  Was it like rats?  Did you film them?  Well, that's a...  I filmed, but I have nothing for my YouTube channel.  There's a lot of rats and stuff.  I mean, because people have seen rats.  I got to come up with a plan and come up with some different...  Me and Walsh to feed them.  Peanut butter.  They love peanut butter.  You reach these peanut butter cups.  You throw one or two of those down.  Fuck. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  They'll fucking...  And they'll come for that shit?  That's like if I'm out...  If you want me out of the house, then you just put camel toe in the hallway.  Well, I know where the holes are.  I know where the fucking paths are that they make.  So, all right.  I'm going there with some peanut butter cups.  Yeah.  It's a dead one.  Yeah.  Look at me.  They sure die funny, those rats.  They're on their back with their little paws.  Oh, that is a...  Ugh.  Oh, God.  Those fucking rats are disgusting.  But then a guy tweeted me.  He said that...  Let me read this. 
[00:09:00]  Because this sounds cool.  Maybe someone can help me out.  Because, unfortunately, 140 characters doesn't do this justice.  You should come to work with me in the electric manholes in the street.  If you want to see rats.  I have sick video of them.  Yeah.  What is an electric manhole?  I guess that's where they access the wires and stuff.  Like Con Ed.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I thought it was like they set up these electric manholes to zap rats.  Hmm.  That means I'm going to see some rats without any fucking protection.  I'm not that brave.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Maybe with those big electric gloves on.  Yeah?  Yeah.  The ones they pull those big fucking electric handles with.  Fuck.  It's electric.  But Jimmy...  Oh, look at them all.  Oh, God.  Wait, where's that?  Rat Zoo.  Collect Pond Park, downtown Manhattan.  Ugh.  Yeah, this is what I started to see.  Ah.  They were starting to come out, but I couldn't wait around.  Look, look, look, look.  Yeah, I know.  Do they bug you?  I can't.  I'm fucked.  Do they bug me?  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look inside.  They're showing in the grass.  Whenever you have like a... 
[00:10:00]  Whenever there's grass, you can look in there and see them running around.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  And they're running out.  They're coming around.  They're giant.  Yeah, yeah.  That's basically what we saw last night is what's happening in this video, but not enough.  They don't bother you, though.  I mean, they try to avoid you.  Dude, I had one hiss at me.  I was walking...  Sure wasn't rolling?  Yeah.  I was walking home late one night with my brother-in-law's, and we're going down one  of the streets that's really dark with the brownstones, and we saw one, so we approached  it, and it felt trapped because it was near the garbage and the front entrance of this 
[00:10:30]  brownstone that had kind of bushes and stuff.  So we're kind of looking around because we wanted a closer look at this thing.  It was trapped, and it hissed.  It made a noise that made us all jump the fuck back, like, get the fuck out of here.  I didn't know they made noises like that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I can't even describe this hiss.  Way worse than a fucking cat.  Way the fuck worse.  Fuck.  So, I guess if I waited longer, it was going to get really good because everyone was saying, 
[00:11:00]  oh, yeah, they come out, and they get aggressive because they want the horse  feed that's all over the sidewalk.  Yeah.  So, for the people that are wondering, it's the Plaza Hotel.  It's across the street, actually.  It's a little park.  I think it's called Army Something Park.  And, man, there is some activity there that the paper was writing about.  I bailed at 10 o'clock.  I bet you if I made it to 11, 1130, it was going to get really good.  The Plaza, huh?  But, I mean, there was nothing forever. 
[00:11:30]  And then you just see the little, some leaves go like this, like a little rustling.  And there's a little baby.  I'm like, okay, they're starting to come out.  And sure enough, man, they just started fucking coming out one by one.  That's skeevy, man.  I think they were coming from one of the sewers over there, too, because the two hopped out  of a sewer, I think, and ran across the lawn, like the kangaroos.  So, that was my night.  That's wonderful.  You wouldn't do anything like that?  No, I would.  I would, but I'd be so skeeved out. 
[00:12:00]  You think you're brave until, like, you're pretty close to one, and it really fucking skeeves  you out.  I get the heebie-jeebies real easy with certain bugs and things like rats and stuff.  Right.  But I'll look.  The shit like that, I'll look at it and be like, eeeh.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a pull saw.  Let me say hi to Brian in Jersey.  Brian?  Brian.  Yo, yo.  Hey.  You guys think that rats are bad?  You should come out by me. 
[00:12:30]  Walk up my front door this morning.  It's a big-ass bear, like 400 pounds.  Yes, I need a gig.  Oh, I think Steve's losing his gig today.  Oh, fuck.  I'll bet if he knows that they were going sports talk, he's probably been trying to talk sports  all week to whoever would listen.  Oh, my God.  Yes, I understand.  There was a Homer yesterday.  Yes.  Everyone was yelling Homer at me when I walked by.  Homer.  Yeah.  I know the legendary rock station going away, YSP in Philly. 
[00:13:00]  It's going all sports.  Yeah, sports talk.  I hope that fucking flops.  It's not going to flop.  No, I know.  Sports talk works.  Sports talk is huge right now.  But do they need more of it?  Isn't there enough on AM?  FM rock?  Who wants to listen to that shit?  How about this?  Not only is it going to FM, there's more than one per city now.  It used to be there was one per city.  But now, a lot of these cities have got two FM sports talk stations.  It's probably a cheap format to do.  And there's also, you're not going to get any trouble doing it. 
[00:13:30]  And the rock stations all stink.  I mean, they can't play enough songs.  They can't keep up with fucking satellite or iPods.  I'm so glad we're not involved in that.  The rock stations did it to themselves.  They got the consultants.  They were listening to the stupid consultants that were telling them to play the same hundred songs  over and over again and telling their DJs to shut the fuck up.  And then they wonder why the entire audience went away.  Even a good rock station would have trouble.  But the way they do it, they have no shot. 
[00:14:00]  But they saw the signs coming years ago, and they just ignored all of them.  Those dopey lawyers at CBS still have a job?  Because those dopey lawyers were the ones that pretty much shut us down and everyone else down at K-Rock.  But they are also in charge of YSP in Philly.  So why are those lawyers still employed?  They have done nothing but fucking give bad advice.  What they did was ruin a really good format.  City by city.  Because they also ran the Boston station.  BCN that went all sports. 
[00:14:30]  So why are they still getting a paycheck?  I hear shit like that.  And I'm like, I'm just glad we're not there and involved in this.  Where it's like, oh boy.  Like that stress of terrestrial radio and the format change and ratings and like all that stuff.  You know, we obviously take our shots here at SiriusXM Satellite Radio.  You know, and not just for ourselves.  For people like Sam who don't make enough money and have to go in and ask for a raise every day. 
[00:15:00]  How'd it go yesterday?  How'd that work out for you?  You did good?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm a millionaire.  All right.  It worked out perfectly.  Enjoy the taxes.  But just like, I remember being in that shit and just being like, oh God.  Right.  Oh, the stress.  This guy wants us to know that it's an AM station that has taken over YSP.  We know that.  What is it?  WIP or something like that down there in Philly? 
[00:15:30]  W-I-P?  Yeah, WIP.  I understand there was a bunch of goals.  Poor Steve.  He gets a good gig down there with Bonaduce.  He is.  I don't think they're keeping Bonaduce.  Are they or no?  We don't know.  Steve is literally a few days away from one year since getting let go from here.  Wow.  The 25th, I guess, huh?  That was a quick year.  That went by pretty quickly.  I hope the next year goes by really fucking fast.  All that money that they saved on him got spent on, oh yeah.  Flowers.  Flowers for a wedding? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, Steve has your raise.  Yeah.  Well, whoever wins this Bobo contest also does.  They tucked that away.  They just reallocated those resources to somebody else.  They could have gave that to you, Sam, give you a little raise or a part of it, and they  still would have saved money.  Well, the precedent was set several years ago when Than left.  And nothing happened.  That nobody gets replaced here.  When Than left, that was our money.  We were supposed to use that to bring on someone new.  Disappeared.  And that money just disappeared.  We didn't pocket it. 
[00:16:30]  No.  So they have that money, and they have Steve's money.  So they've been saving a lot lately.  Anyone else?  Ah.  Oh.  Oh, his money too?  Ah.  Gentlemen.  All right.  Damn, there's plenty of money they're holding.  That could be your raise, Sam.  Hey, I understand the Phillies were hitting double plays.  Really awkward sports talk with anybody who will listen.  Hey, how's it going?  Did you hear about the two pop-ups yesterday? 
[00:17:00]  They should do that.  I'm thinking we should get the fanatic in.  Yeah.  And talk some sports.  We could ask about the home runs, and if he thinks that the Pirates, I mean the Phillies,  are going to be hitting doubles.  What?  Doubles.  We can let him throw out the first rock song pitch.  Boo.  Jimmy, your homeopathy crap is a sham. 
[00:17:30]  Good old James Randi, you know, the pen guy?  Yeah.  Did a TED lecture?  Oh, no.  A TED lecture?  What's that?  Does anyone know?  That's what I talk publicly, Gregory.  Did a lecture about it and other shams.  I don't know if homeopathic is all.  I won't say that's a sham.  All of it.  I mean, some of it might be, but I don't think all of it's a, you know, how can all of it  be a scam?  Some of it's probably just not using the stuff that's in regular medicine. 
[00:18:00]  It's a fugazi.  I'm sure, but a lot of it never works for me, though.  Homeopathic stuff, just like, when I use sinus spray, it just doesn't work as well as  Afrin.  As the chemicals.  Yeah, but Afrin fucking reclogs you a couple days later.  Damn, that's not good.  No.  Speaking of bears, um, yes.  Girl called mom as bear ate her.  This is one of the stories of the day.  Oh, spread your legs.  Teenage girl called her mother as a brown bear and three cubs ate her and her stepfather  alive. 
[00:18:30]  Whoa.  Where were they?  Olga.  That should be a clue.  Olga Moskalyova.  19.  Jesus.  Made three calls to her mother, uh, Tatiana, during the hour-long ordeal as the adult bear  toyed with her before killing her.  Mom, the bear is eating me.  Mom, it's such agony.  Mother, help me.  The bear, it eats me now.  She screamed.  Wow.  I heard the real horror in Olga's voice and the bear chewing, Tatiana said. 
[00:19:00]  Wow.  The mom could hear the bear chewing her daughter alive.  What a horrid call to get.  Oh, my God.  What good service she got, though.  You know she didn't have an iPhone.  She must have had Verizon if she could make a call.  That's a great ad for whatever fucking phone service she had.  Look, if I'm ever being eaten alive by a bear, I'm not calling loved ones to have that vision  in their heads forever.  I'll take my eating without calling anyone.  You're just supposed to lay there.  Where did that article do it?  Where were they?  What happened?  The attack took place near Petra Blavaka, in eastern Siberia. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, man.  Siberian bear.  They don't put up on any shit.  They don't play.  Yeah.  They don't play.  It's cold.  She probably should have said, get out of here.  What do you think, I'm a bunch of berries or something?  Yeah, I should have.  What?  What happened?  I want to see a documentary badly.  It's going to be, I want to see if we can get a copy.  I'm going to ask Roland to get us Stanless Steel. 
[00:20:00]  Stanless Steel.  What's that about?  About a guy named Stan.  Oh, boy.  What is Stan up to?  Stan is a fucking, can you Google Stanless Steel, please?  He's a strong man from New Jersey.  And I hear it's getting four-star reviews.  And Roger Ebert gave it a good review.  The Chicago Tribune gave it four stars.  Can anyone tell if he gave it a good review?  What did he do?  Well, he gave it four drops.  Four drops of drool.  Four drops.  Now, the name, I found his name, and I'm like, he looks really familiar. 
[00:20:30]  And then I realized, I believe this is my friend Stanley, who I knew so many years ago, 30 years ago.  I told you the bodybuilder and his brother, who were very close friends of mine?  Yes.  I believe that is him.  I remember you saying Stanley.  And I believe that's him.  And he looks the same.  He's older now.  Obviously, he's 30 years older.  But I think that's fucking him. 
[00:21:00]  Wow.  And I really, really want to see this guy's documentary.  I think it's came and went in New York.  So if anybody...  What's the movie about?  It's about, I guess, what he does.  Strong man, obviously.  Because he bends metal.  What's the angle?  He bends coins.  But for real bends them.  Not like with Matt.  He's a fucking...  I remember him being a bodybuilder and being strong.  But I didn't realize that he was a potential...  Like, fucking...  Yeah.  Lunatarily, really strong.  There's footage of him, locked arms, and two small planes.  I mean, they're small, trying to go away, and they can't. 
[00:21:30]  And he's just...  But I really want to see stainless steel.  If anybody knows anything about it...  Yeah, can we just see a little bit of the trailer?  Because they said it's a really good documentary.  Huh.  I like it so far.  Oh.  You did some stuff with bending.  Some metal pipes, didn't you?  I do.  I bend the strongest bars in the world.  Yeah.  I thought so.  They call me stainless steel. 
[00:22:00]  The strongest man in the world at bending steel.  I actually can bend coins in my fingers.  No.  No, come on.  Ladies and gentlemen, I bring to you the moment you've been waiting for.  I can't mess this up, because I only have, like, a few more shots.  That's fucking Stanley.  That's all I've got.  You grew up with this guy.  I know him.  The best.  Yeah, I know him.  You do.  It's finding the right peg to fit the hole, so to speak.  I don't know.  What is he intent?  I don't know.  Who's that man?  That sounds like something to do with a truck stop. 
[00:22:30]  He takes point, pause that.  What he does is he puts a cloth in his hand.  Yeah, that's a good thing.  And he takes a fucking nail, and with his hand, he just takes it and he swings it down,  and he puts it through, like, two license plates.  Two license plates into wood.  Through a piece of wood.  Yeah.  With nothing on it, just a piece of cloth on his fucking palm.  Was there trickery there?  No.  No, he's a fucking...  No.  He's the real...  He's real.  Good. 
[00:23:00]  He's one of the real supermen.  That's Mike.  Who's Mike?  I believe that's Mike.  Will you pause this, Sam?  Jesus.  Throw hot oil on him, Stanley.  Oh, shit.  I believe that's Mike.  Throw hot oil on him, Stanley.  I believe that's him.  Remember that story?  Yep.  I think that's it.  I love that story.  I can't swear to it.  I would have to talk to him, but it just seems to me too close to be...  For coincidence.  But I was fucking out of my mind.  I couldn't be like, these guys, I've been wondering what happened to them for 30 fucking... 
[00:23:30]  Because Stan was like...  Mike was my age and Stan was like 10 years older.  And he would hang out with his kid brother and they would play Asteroids and that's how  I met them.  In like 1980.  And they were with me, I think, or they stopped in the day I got on the fucking paper.  When me and Ozzy were in the paper together in 81.  Yeah.  Super Bowl, the beginning of 81, playing for 10 hours during Super Bowl Sunday.  You're like the Tom Cruise of this crowd, though.  As far as entertainment goes.  Like, if you want to take it on that scale.  And the most handsome.  Yes. 
[00:24:00]  Yes.  But I fucking...  I haven't talked to them in probably 29 fucking years, man.  Wow.  I'm so happy for him because it's getting...  I read some of the reviews.  They said it was really fucking good.  I don't know what his goal is, but...  Yes, the goal.  I can't be hurt.  Exactly.  If I want it.  Why don't you set goals right now?  The diamond in rough form, it's valuable. 
[00:24:30]  But when you shine it, then it sparkles.  And that's what we're going to do.  We're going to shine up our lives.  But when you tell me to get strong like that, how the hell am I going to beef up like this?  Well, you have to take mental responsibility.  Oh, come on, man.  What's his brother?  What do you mean?  Have some mustard, whore?  All this extra baggage here and there in your brain.  You know, you want to have someone to talk to about it.  You want to relate to someone.  He's just walking through a bodybuilding competition. 
[00:25:00]  He works for a scrap kind of place in Jersey.  He's just a brute.  This is his spirit.  This is his core.  His very being.  I don't know what...  They're just showing kind of clips of him.  I don't know if he plays...  He probably doesn't play well on radio, but they're just showing clips of his life.  And I don't know exactly what the goal of the documentary is or what it's accomplishing or what they're saying.  They're not really telling you.  Is he entering something or does he just... 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, like what's the...  I don't know.  What's the payoff?  I was watching clips of him on Ricky Lake and he's been on a lot of television.  Obviously, the payoff is he's chasing the dream.  He wants to be famous for doing this stuff and it doesn't seem like it's sticking.  Yeah.  All those things...  There lies the frustration.  We were seeing...  You guys couldn't see, obviously, but there's clips of him bent over.  Oh, there's one clip I watched of him fucking popping a full beer can against his leg.  Just holding it against his leg and pressing it until it bursts.  Oh, shit.  He's a big boy.  Oh, that's so fucking cool to see somebody I've wondered for so many years. 
[00:26:00]  Can we get him in here?  I would love to.  I Twittered him and I tried to Facebook him.  It's like I'm a chick.  Oh.  But I was so fucking happy to see Stanley.  I think that's them.  And you were just kids when you knew him.  I would.  Well, he was...  He's 10 years older than us, I think.  But Mike...  I mean, we're 13 years old?  14 years old.  So I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't...  There's...  Where's the screening, Sam?  I think it...  What if he saw you somewhere and was like, oh, that's...  I don't know.  That's Jimmy.  You know what?  Brooklyn in September. 
[00:26:30]  Hmm.  I guess that just sounded like a symbol.  September 8th...  Where?  September 18th?  18th in Brooklyn.  Park Slope.  I'd love to go to that.  You know what?  If we're going to play trailers, I just got one.  Can Roland get this copy of this, please?  The screener?  I emailed him.  Okay.  And also maybe get the director in here.  Or Stan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That'll try.  Yeah.  No.  He's on the red eye.  He's strong.  He's a strong guy.  Do you want it?  What?  Fucking... 
[00:27:00]  Here he is.  Here's Roland.  Hi, Roland.  Hi, Roland.  Bring him in for a second.  Because I want to thank Cliff Barry on Twitter.  He just...  Come here for a second.  Because Roland went rat hunting with me last night.  He was freaked.  Comes.  Roland, how creepy was the rat hunting yesterday?  It was very creepy.  It freaked me out.  I went, ah!  Yeah.  They are just disgusting.  Yeah.  He was like...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just found a trailer for a rat movie that someone's making in New York City. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, God.  This is why I didn't post my video.  Because this is nothing to compare to what I'm seeing on my iPad.  Oh.  Roland, I was telling these guys as we...  The longer we waited, how much bigger the rats were getting and how more frequent they...  And those characters were leaving as the night went on.  I know.  I'm thinking if we were there at midnight, it was going to be a fucking scene.  Oh, really?  I just couldn't stay up that late.  I was tired.  That kangaroo rat just freaked me out. 
[00:28:00]  I'm like, eeeeh!  The two that ran across the lawn, right?  Yeah.  It's like a little...  It looks like a mini cat that just started hopping.  Was it hopping around or something?  Yes.  Well, this guy on Twitter just turned me on to this.  Speaking of documentaries, Jimmy, this is a real movie.  Rats of Tompkins Square Park.  And here's the trailer.  Bike Lane Films.  A public park. 
[00:28:30]  Rat poison.  Just now footage of an open field.  Rats crawling out of trees.  Oh, top scum's work.  There's just a lot of rats.  People throw food there for us.  Pigeons and rats hanging out together.  Where's Tompkins Square Park?  Brooklyn? 
[00:29:00]  There's some big fucking rat holes there.  Holy shit.  Wow, that's a big rat.  It's like a field.  It's just got big holes in the middle of it.  Yeah, they all live underground.  They're in the streets.  They're in the streets.  Holy shit, they're fucking...  They're fat, too.  Yeah, they're all big, fat, looking like fat rats.  It's really just the same thing over and over, but it's kind of fun.  Infestation.  God damn, there's a lot of these fucking buggers.  Or invasion. 
[00:29:30]  It's very funny.  Wow, it's scaring the pigeons away.  It just went to attack a pigeon.  How big are the rat holes, though?  It looks like meteor craters in the fucking ground.  Wow, fuck yeah.  This summer.  Rats of Thompson.  It's not a real movie.  Chuck E. Cheese, the guy puts for...  Thank you for that.  Holy shit.  Yeah, I guess with those oats and stuff that the horses are eating, they love that shit. 
[00:30:00]  Of course.  And those guys don't clean that stuff up.  They just leave them laying around there.  No, man.  Strap the old feed bag on.  They're too busy trying to get someone to, you know, give a ride.  Yeah.  They should just feed them a big can of beefarino.  That's what they do.  Apparently, it makes them pass gas.  Dominic Barber's in trouble again.  Yeah.  Being sued again, I think.  Yes. 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  This was what...  These are the allegations that were going on about a year ago when he had to say,  I'm leaving my practice.  He was fucking people over, allegedly.  Fucking people over for their retainers.  Yeah.  Not, you know, buck-toothed, you know, little kids' retainers.  Money.  How do you screw someone for a retainer?  Or what, do you just not do the work?  Yeah.  You take their money, and then you...  That's what they're saying.  Yeah.  You take their money, and you don't do the work that was promised. 
[00:31:00]  Or you do the work that was promised, and don't give back the rest of the retainer  if something's settled quickly.  And he doesn't have the record of the hours that were put in.  And, yeah, he kept, you know, allegedly, again, kept the money.  One client suing for $200,000, and one is for $450,000.  Yeah.  A hefty retainer.  I can only say it couldn't, couldn't happen to a nicer man.  How happy are you? 
[00:31:30]  I love, I love, because, yeah, eventually justice catches up with some people, you know.  Not all, unfortunately.  No, there have been some Nazis that went to South America and lived wonderful lives well  into their 90s.  But most guys in a divorce case don't get to see their wife's or ex-wife's divorce lawyer  suffering or being in the paper and feeling, you know, it's just nice.  Yeah, take a giant fall from his fucking career.  He had to retire.  This guy's career was huge. 
[00:32:00]  He's been through divorces.  He's, like, lost his fucking business.  Would you like it if he committed suicide?  If I heard that Dominic Barbera was so despondent over these allegations that he in some way  took his own life, I would not feel the least bit sorry for him or how he felt in those moments  leading up to his decision to take his own life. 
[00:32:30]  I would not give a shit.  I might even feel a little, you know, a little joy.  Not that I would wish anything, any harm to come of anybody.  But if he himself was so despondent over these allegations and the loss of so much over the  years that he did decide to take his own life, I would not be sorry. 
[00:33:00]  He's a prick.  Like, wouldn't give a shit, as a matter of fact.  He's a fucking prick.  Is pissing on his grave?  Would that be...  No, he's not dead.  There's a great clip that a lot of you are going to see today.  Christine O'Donnell walks off Piers Morgan's show last night.  Piers?  Who's that?  Who's Christine O'Donnell?  I know the name.  She's that fucking politician there that was talking about witchcraft and... 
[00:33:30]  Tea partier.  Yeah.  Where's she from?  Like, PA?  She's one of those PA bruds.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Where's she from?  So, uh...  Piers asks her about gay marriage.  And she couldn't handle the question.  Well, she was on promoting her book.  Right.  Yeah.  And so...  And you know how some people come here and they go, you know, they want to talk about this,  they don't want to talk about, and then they give you the laundry list of shit they don't  want to talk about.  Which we never agreed to, by the way.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  Well, very rarely would you agree.  If, you know, if the people are cool and everything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, you know, she's a Republican Party politician, founded the Advocacy Organization, and has  been an advocate for non-profit, blah, blah, blah causes for nearly 20 years.  So, she, you know, she's in the public eye.  I think it's fair that Piers would ask her political questions about candidates.  It's a big topic right now. 
[00:34:30]  People that are running for president.  And she just...  My book, my book, my book.  Shut the fuck up.  Answer a question.  I hate we get guests like that.  I know.  I see he has to deal with that shit, too.  What's her book about?  It's about...  Is it about the odor on her clit?  She has a cheesy odor on her clit, and she's talking about it finally.  Cheesy odor.  I think it's about her views on America and how to make it better.  It's supposed to be an inspirational tale of bringing the country to where it should be. 
[00:35:00]  So, it's more political fucking propaganda from the conservative far right.  Yeah.  All right.  So, fucking Piers is totally within his boundaries there.  Jimmy, you're going to love this clip.  You're going to love this.  So, Piers asked her about gay marriage.  Right now, I'm curious about whether you support gay marriage.  You're getting...  You're borderline being a little bit rude.  You know, I obviously...  Really?  What the fuck?  And he's even surprised.  Fuck you. 
[00:35:30]  Like, really?  Am I?  You're fucking...  That's a hot topic, man.  Absolutely.  And she's involved in the political spectrum.  Yes.  Why didn't she just say no?  Have the fucking...  Have your conviction.  I would have said, yes, I'm for it.  Why don't you just say, no, you're not?  Right.  Say, no, you're not.  How is that being rude?  That's one of the hottest topics in America, and in American politics.  I don't want gay people not buying my book.  I fucking hate them all.  Yeah, but gay people don't buy my book.  That's exactly what it is.  If you're in the political world, you should be able to handle a question like that.  Of course.  And work your way around it.  Why dance around it? 
[00:36:00]  You are or you're not.  You believe in it or you don't.  Oh, exactly.  At least, whatever her name was, Miss America, who I didn't agree with her answer, but this  is why I hated Perez Hilton and a lot of gay activists, because they asked her how she  felt about it.  They asked her.  She gave an honest answer.  She gave an honest answer that she was against it, and I don't agree with that.  I think she's an asshole, but you know what?  Right.  At least she told the truth, and she gave her opinion, and she's fucking punished for it.  She wasn't volunteering an opinion and saying, hey, by the way, this is how I feel  about gay marriage.  She was asked by that fucking asshole, Perez Hilton, and she gave an answer. 
[00:36:30]  Because he didn't like the answer, then they all go out for blood.  Shut up.  Unbelievable.  Right now, I'm curious about whether you support gay marriage.  You're borderline being a little bit rude.  Really?  I obviously want to talk about the issues that I choose to talk about in the book.  Do you answer that question in the book? 
[00:37:00]  I talk about my religious beliefs, yeah.  I absolutely do.  Do you talk about gay marriage in the book?  What relevance is that right now?  That's the book.  Now she's really being an asshole, because now he's trying to say, look, we're talking about  your book, then.  All right.  Do you address that in the book?  That's a question about the fucking book.  And didn't she say, yes, it's about my...  Can you rewind a little bit over?  It sounded like she said, yes, it's about my religious beliefs, yes.  So then she's actually almost implying that she talks about that, or what would involve 
[00:37:30]  that, and her feelings about that.  And then he asks a follow-up question, and this fucking twat doesn't want to answer it.  And not even asking again, you know, are you for or against, he's asking her if she addresses  it in the book.  She doesn't even have to say yes or no at that point.  She just, she can say, it's in the book, you want to know, read it.  We've heard fucking people throw that line of shit out every so often, but she won't  even address if it's in the book?  Oh, this fucking dumb bitch. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, God.  Talk about gay marriage in the book.  What relevance is that right now?  Is there a piece of legislation?  I mean, I shouldn't be voting on anything.  It's obviously one of the most, it's obviously, as you know, because of Michelle Bartman's  views and others, it's obviously a highly contentious political issue.  I'm just curious what your view is.  You keep saying it's in the book.  So I'm bemused as to why you wouldn't just say it in an interview.  It's in the book.  Because I don't think it's relevant.  It's not a topic that I choose to embrace.  It's not what I'm championing right now. 
[00:38:30]  I've been there, done that, gone down that road right now.  What I'm trying to do is to promote a book that I hope to be a very inspirational story  to people who are part of the Tea Party movement so that they can continue, you know, in this  movement to bring America back to the second American revolution.  That's my goal.  That's my focus right now.  Is awful.  Yeah, they're...  Wow, is shit.  She is fucking hateable.  Idiot.  Yep. 
[00:39:00]  What an idiot.  I'm happy that Piers has to deal with the same shit from these dummies that we have  to deal with.  Without...  It's never political people.  It's usually actors or whatever.  I don't want to talk about the divorce.  Paris Hilton.  Yeah, but she's just valueless.  But this is one who should talk about it because she has a book.  Of course.  It's in the book.  Why would I...  It's not one I choose to embrace.  Answer the fucking question, you fucking twat.  That wasn't said very smartly.  Do you agree with Michelle Bachman that we should maybe repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell?  You should restore that? 
[00:39:30]  I'm not talking about policies.  I'm not running for office.  Ask Michelle Bachman what she thinks.  Ask the candidates who are running for office what they think.  No personality.  Why are you being so weird about this?  I'm not being weird about...  That's a really good question.  Why is she?  Yeah.  Why is she being so weird about this?  She's being completely evasive about political topics that she's involved in.  Because she's a coward and she doesn't want to hurt book sales by giving the wrong answer.  Ah.  That's all it is.  Antwin said she wants gays to buy her book or she wants people who believe in gay rights 
[00:40:00]  to buy her book.  She's just a coward who wants book sales.  She wants more moderate people to buy it and, you know...  You can't promote it then.  She's one of these fucking crazy ass religious righties that I can't stand.  She's fucking despicable.  I'd fuck her though.  Why are we paying attention to her?  Why is the media paying attention to her?  She pops up here and there and people fucking pay attention to her.  I honestly do not know.  She should be squashed like a bug. 
[00:40:30]  Or, you know, just fucking shoved to...  Relegated to the back burner, as they say.  Gives a shit.  I love what Pierce is doing though.  I actually like him, but I...  He's not stopping.  I didn't think I would like him, but after our interview with him, I was like, I kind  of enjoyed him.  Yeah, yeah.  He was cool.  I liked him so much more than I thought I would.  Yeah.  He's a smart guy.  That's what they think.  Why are you being so weird about this?  I'm not being weird about this, Pierce.  I'm not running for office.  I'm not promoting a legislative agenda.  I'm promoting the policies that I lay out in the book that are mostly fiscal, that are 
[00:41:00]  mostly constitutional.  That's why I agreed to come on your show.  That's what I want to talk about.  I'm not being weird.  You're being a little rude.  Oh, she's a cunt.  I don't...  I'm baffled as to why you think I'm being...  I think I'm being rather charming and respectful.  I'm just asking you questions based on your own public statements and now what you've written  in your own book.  It's hardly rude to ask you that, surely.  Well, don't you think as a host, if I say this is what I want to talk about, that's what 
[00:41:30]  we should address?  No!  Uh, not really, no.  You're a politician.  Yeah.  Okay, I'm being pulled away.  Bye.  We turned down another interview for this.  Good.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  You're leaving?  Well, I was supposed to be speaking at the Republican Women's Club at 6 o'clock and I chose to be  a little late for that.  Not to be...  Shut up.  You know...  What?  Yeah, not to endure a rude talk show host, but to talk to you about... 
[00:42:00]  I don't understand why...  ...and to talk about the issues that I address in my book.  Have you read the book?  Yes, but these issues are in your book.  That's my point.  You do talk about them.  Okay.  All right, are we off?  Are we done?  He's still there.  I'm not.  I'm still here.  He says he still wants to talk to you.  Well...  It would appear that the interview has just been ended because I had the audacity to ask questions  based on stuff that's in this book. 
[00:42:30]  Anyway, it's a good book.  It's called Troublemaker.  I think we now know why it's called Troublemaker.  Christine O'Donnell.  Available in all good bookshops.  Making America Great Again.  All right, there's a couple of good bookshops.  Nice and sarcastic here.  Bookshops.  Yeah, but I don't know if people, you know, picked up on the sarcasm.  I wonder.  What do you...  Yeah.  I mean, when she calls him a rude talk show host, that's not even close to being rude.  And that wasn't...  By the way, that wasn't a publicist, this dude, because she was being the cunt.  The publicist was just reacting to her being a cunt.  And she was being a cunt.  Right.  He should have peed on her book. 
[00:43:00]  Or just knocked it on the...  I think it would have been funny if he...  I mean, again, but he's talking to people, dude.  He's getting people, like Gingrich or her, like...  Yeah.  There's a way to handle that, which he just...  He handled it perfectly.  I'm just...  Yep.  But it would have been funny if he knocked it on the floor.  Something.  It's a wonderful book.  Yeah.  Flock.  That would have been great.  You can buy it if you want, because...  Yeah.  I learned nothing about it.  Why am I doing an impression of him?  It just starts tearing pages out of it, like we've done here.  Yeah, we're able to talk about it with a den-den.  That's why I said pee. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, yes.  It may have been a peeing incident.  Yes.  She's just a twat.  Yes, she is.  She came across as a twat.  Good for peers.  We're done here?  That's a good moment for him.  You go talk to the Republican women.  You go talk to a group who's comfortable and like-minded.  Right.  Like every other fucking dummy does when they don't want to be...  When they don't want to talk about things that might make them unpopular with whoever  they're talking to.  Preaching to the converted, Jim.  That's what she's going to do.  Go there, get applause. 
[00:44:00]  She wants those cheap...  They call them cheap slut applause breaks.  Yes.  When you say something, you know it's going to get an applause break.  Yeah.  And ooh, did I get heckled last night.  Really?  Oh, no.  Why?  Jimmy, what happened?  What happened?  Could that be the tease before break?  It's not strong enough to be a tease.  All right.  To be honest with you, it's just not...  Fair enough.  What happened?  I was just...  I walked on and I said I'm going to Utah tomorrow and some lady goes like, woo!  Or boo!  Or whatever.  She made some noise.  So I was like, oh, you're from Utah.  We joked for a second. 
[00:44:30]  Nothing bad.  Not fairly attractive, blonde.  And then I just kept talking and then she piped in again.  And so I was like, all right.  I was just starting my set.  And so I was quieting her down.  She kept talking.  So I was like, I said something about how I guess she'll just keep talking to anybody  who has ears and isn't running away from her.  Like, it wasn't a horrible thing, but I was trying to go like, shut up.  Right, right.  And then she walked out a few minutes later.  And I'm doing something and her boyfriend kept talking.  And I could see his fucking cunt face right now. 
[00:45:00]  And I was in the middle of talking about like, how I like to be cuckolded sexually or something.  And I said, and I really, again, I was nice about it.  I'm like, sorry, please.  Like, this is important stuff.  That's how I'll shut somebody down.  Right, right.  Because it's so obviously not important stuff.  In a goofy way.  Yeah, yeah.  And he goes, I'm sorry.  It's boring.  It's not funny.  And I immediately knew, okay, this fucking faggot pussy boy is sticking up for his fucking girlfriend.  So I, believe me, I hated him. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  And so I started to slam him.  And I forget what I said to him.  I'm just telling him, like, why don't you just get the fuck out then?  And he goes, what are you mad?  And he had that fucking cocksucker Donny Osmond smile.  Oh.  But it was that passive aggressive.  Yes.  But I really fucking smashed him.  Um, and I just kept attacking him and kept going back to him.  What were you saying?  Like, like.  This is passive aggressive and a fucking.  I forget.  I honestly don't remember.  I have it on tape though.  I wish.  It would be a better story if I could remember.  Mm-hmm.  But I know that I went way farther with it than he wanted to go. 
[00:46:00]  And it shut him down.  Because I told him, don't try to fucking reverse psychology with that passive aggressive shit.  And it wasn't really funny.  All the crowd hated him and started clapping.  And, uh.  I just kept going back to him.  And I kept going back to him.  And, uh.  They finally walked out.  And it felt so good to fucking.  I haven't had one of those.  I was funny with it.  But I was more mean than funny.  I think. 
[00:46:30]  Good.  I haven't been heckled like that.  Like.  It felt so.  The crowd went nuts.  I mean.  They were totally with me.  Because they just saw that he was a cocksucker.  And a fucking.  Just some.  And I think I called him a mid-level.  Some fucking mid-level.  Mid-level manager's jizz bucket.  Some fucking office puke.  And I just told the audience.  How nice.  Do you know how much I love my job?  Wouldn't you love to do this at your job with the jerk off in the office?  And everybody was just happy.  Where you could just turn around and fucking nail him like that.  Oh.  That's great.  And I'm capturing the emotion I felt.  Although I'm not doing a good job of describing it. 
[00:47:00]  Because I didn't think to talk about it.  No.  That's good.  No.  You're in the moment.  I hated that guy so much.  Did the crowd applaud you?  Fucking.  When I went off.  It was towards the middle.  Towards the end of my set.  Yeah.  It was a tremendous applause coming off.  Because they knew exactly what he was.  I was so angry.  That I was hoping that he was waiting for me to be confrontational.  Like.  And I very rarely get that angry.  But I hated his fucking striped shirt.  He's every.  He's every absolute fucking office jerk off. 
[00:47:30]  That is you.  It's like.  He's the guy that used to make.  He's like.  He's an office boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He used to making a sarcastic comment.  And he forgets.  I knew I was wearing.  I was wearing this shirt.  The Sabbath shirt.  But it's like.  Hey.  Stupid asshole.  I've been doing this for 21 years.  You're not.  You're never going to win this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're not.  Never.  You're not winning.  Will you win this situation.  Yeah.  With that fucking.  You're broad.  You're never going to ever win.  Because I don't mind humiliating myself a little bit to get to you.  Sure.  And.  And he would never do that. 
[00:48:00]  And that fucking.  What are you mad?  And his dumb fucking.  Oh fuck.  And I kept mocking his fucking pussy boy smile.  And I know it.  I just know I wrecked their fucking night.  That felt good.  But I literally.  Oh.  I almost wanted a physical confrontation.  And it's rare that I feel that angry.  I'm sorry I'm getting.  I wish I had brought the tape in or whatever.  Hell no.  This is great.  I'm just.  You're described it perfectly.  I hated that guy.  I hate him.  Yeah.  We all hate him now.  I know exactly who you're talking about. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Like the type of person.  Oh good.  Good.  Fuck him.  Don't try to salvage.  And his cunt.  Don't try to salvage.  Oh and the crowd went nuts.  Because he walked out first.  And then she started walking out.  And I'm like.  I'm sorry I had to do that.  But I really want to fuck you.  And the crowd really enjoyed that.  Oh wow.  And she slammed me back.  She was a cunt.  And she wasn't happy.  But it was just nice to just sit there and sexualize her like that.  And she had to listen to her.  Oh perfect.  You should have thrown hot oil on her.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  What did he say?  Hey whore. 
[00:49:00]  Have some mustard.  And she waved.  And he threw a Chinese mustard and hit her chest.  Hey whore.  Have some mustard.  Hey Stanley.  You want to throw hot oil on him?  If it's them.  He wanted to go back.  Because the guy was hitchhiking bare chested in 100 degree weather.  But he wanted to drain engine oil into a fucking margarine dish.  Hey Stanley.  You want to throw hot oil on him?  Hot oil.  It's a medieval time.  We got to get him on the show.  That's fantastic.  If it's the same Stanley and Mike.  I just love these guys to death. 
[00:49:30]  Fucking A.  That's great.  I want to see that documentary so badly.  It's called Stan LaSteele.  I think Strongman is the documentary.  Look it up online.  He's a really really nice guy.  Yeah.  We'll get copies of that.  Hopefully we'll get him in.  We'll get him in.  Alright listen.  Here's the deal.  We got Florentine today at 730.  We got Andrew Dice Clay calling in.  We got Vinny, Uncle Nino, and Dina from the Jersey Shore stopping in.  Oh jeez.  Uncle Nino and his horrible homemade wine.  Horrible jokes.  None of that today.  And his horrible jokes.  Yes.  And we can't wait. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah he's a good dude.  He is.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  What's up baby?  You want to get some dirty talk going?  Yeah that's it.  I'm going to give some cyber sex.  I'm good.  I'm going to lay your back or something.  And I'm going to lick all the way down your neck like this.  I'm going to take my tongue and just go like. 
[00:50:30]  I'm going to clean out your ears or something and get wax on my tongue.  And it'll lick all the way down your neck.  Oh that's a nice dark nipple.  I wouldn't mind getting some nook out of that.  And then I'm going to get my tongue.  And I'm going to start flicking it all over your nipples so much that you start cumming.  You're going to cum so much that your shoes are going to make sloshy noises.  And I'm going to get down here and just start licking your fucking cuda really good.  I'll just I'll open up your cuda.  I got I got like long nails on my middle fingers. 
[00:51:00]  So I'll dig my nails into your cuda lips and I'll open them up and I'll just go like.  And I'll get in there until you cum so many times or whatever.  I'll stick it right in you too.  I'll climb right on you like you're rebuilding or something.  I'm going to climb on like you're a tree or something and just cram my oats at you.  Someone put a finger in my ass.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s. 
[00:51:30]  Fuck you.  Yeah I'm a truck driver and I just want to say fuck you.  There's a manager of the store that told me to be there at 4 a.m.  Not 4.01.  I get there at 3.45.  She don't show up till 4.30.  Talk about oops I overslept.  Let's fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah I'd like to say big fuck you to golf.  Put my balls off, drinking and smoking, hitting balls on the golf course.  For once man when a fucking ball goes straight.  Shooting my boys, trying to fucking impress. 
[00:52:00]  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah I'd like to give a big fuck you to both my wife and Jimmy Norton.  Number one being my wife for struggling so much when I try to pinch her nose and fart her mouth.  And then I'll fuck you to Jim Norton for not giving me a good method of doing it.  Fuck you both.  Fuck you.  Hey this F.U. goes out the boss.  Dude chewing gum on the radio.  How long you been on that gum?  Do you know that nicotine is seeping into your jaw through your gum line?  You're gonna look like that dude Ebert.  Yeah Roger Ebert.  You're gonna look like him.  You know what you're actually gonna sound like on stage? 
[00:52:30]  Anybody wanna buy a dryer door?  Uh, uh, F.U. lost.  Fuck you.  This F.U. goes out to Les Zeppelin.  Claiming to be like Les Zeppelin is like the WNBA claiming to be the NBA.  Not good.  It's like dudes playing left handed.  F.U. Les Zeppelin.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give a big fuck you to Governor Rick Scott.  Alien looking motherfucker.  For cutting teacher's salary by 3% while using taxpayer money, put your name on the Florida welcome signs. 
[00:53:00]  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd like to say a big fuck you to God for putting something as wonderful as a pussy on something as horrible as a fucking woman.  I bet you think it's real funny if they're sniffing your ass off.  A lot of guys gotta put all this fucking bullshit.  Just gonna stick our dick in a worm, wet hole.  Fuck you guys.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this F.U. goes out to my stupid cunt wife. 
[00:53:30]  First, you fall asleep on the fucking couch while I'm at work.  And then I come home and find that our daughter chopped all her fucking hair off with a pair of scissors.  And then you find a way to blame me for it.  Then you throw me out of my own house.  Then while I'm out getting drunk at a bar trying to drink away my fucking sorrows because of your sorry ass,  you call me back saying,  You gotta come back.  We got an appointment to get her a haircut.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Call the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line. 
[00:54:00]  866-FU-LINE-1  That's 866-FU-LINE-1  Sirius XM  The Virus  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony  Uh, quickly.  We're doing our prostitution contest.  It's not.  What, Sam?  Sort of.  It's not prostitution.  Really?  Yeah.  We're giving $1,000 to a lady to go out with Bobo.  What do you think that is? 
[00:54:30]  You don't have to have sex with him.  You just have to have lunch with him.  Ladies, how would you like to win $1,000 in a dream day with our very own Bobo?  I'm kind of enthusiastic.  Did we get any pictures overnight?  Yeah.  This is checking right now.  How many?  All right.  All you have to do is send an email to opianthony at SiriusXM.com  with your photo and quick paragraph of 500 words or less  telling the show a few things about yourself  and why you deserve a date with this hunky, eligible bachelor.  You don't like that part.  You hate that part.  Hunky, eligible bachelor? 
[00:55:00]  Who wouldn't hate that?  Is this Rob Cross trying to be funny?  I don't.  I can't confirm or deny who wrote that.  I think it's Rob Cross.  Could be.  I don't think his internship says that he should be writing funny copy.  He should be getting coffee for the host  and learning about how to be a manager someday.  That's what he should be doing with his internship.  Not writing witty copy for us.  He's not an intern.  What?  He's not?  Ooh!  No.  He's a manager.  Of what?  Like a Starbucks when he's not here? 
[00:55:30]  No, he's a manager of this channel.  What do you mean?  Like he's one of the three guys in charge of this channel.  He's not?  No.  No way.  He's an intern.  That's silly.  He dresses like an intern.  He acts like an intern.  No, he doesn't.  If you're going to make stuff up, at least make it somewhat believable.  Yeah.  I'm not making...  He's my boss.  What?  Boss Cross is what we call him.  Boss Cross.  Do you mean that in a cool California way?  Like he's great?  Yeah.  He's boss?  You're not boss.  1960s?  What the fuck?  No, no, no. 
[00:56:00]  He is my boss.  Like I go to him for approval on things.  He's the Boss Cross.  Ah.  He's what?  Rob Cross the boss.  Boss Cross.  He's your boss?  He's my boss.  You should be making more money than him.  Don't you realize this stuff, Sam?  That's neither here nor there, but he is my boss, my supervisor superior.  He's got to be here or there, right?  I think.  He can't be neither, either.  But he's your actual boss.  He's the boss.  The Bobo Dating Game is sponsored by Trojan.  Get closer with triple-tested quality Trojan bearskin condoms. 
[00:56:30]  Trojan, America's number one most trusted condom brand.  This must be thick.  For official rules and entry details, visit SiriusXM.com slash thevirus.  Deadline for entries is noon Eastern, a week from tomorrow.  By the way, I got those condoms home yesterday.  Yeah.  And I put one on.  I had no one have sex with.  I was alone.  I really was alone.  Did you have a boner when you put it on?  I had a raging erection.  Yeah.  And I put one on just because I hate condoms, but I'll wear them when I have to. 
[00:57:00]  I haven't had to in years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it fucking felt pretty good, man.  Yeah.  Like, I was just toying with my penis in the condom.  It was awesome.  Might as well.  But I mean, honestly, it felt good.  Like, it didn't feel like...  I usually hate because it's so gripping.  Yeah.  But this one is like a fucking just loosey-goosey.  It is loosey-goosey on you.  Yeah.  So I think I'll be able to use these.  Thank God.  Wow.  It's shaped like the tip of when they launch spy satellites.  You ever see a rocket that they launch the spy satellites in? 
[00:57:30]  Like, the actual rocket part is thin, and then the payload section, which, appropriately  named, payload section, gets a little thicker at the tip.  Fat.  Yeah.  So there you go.  And your cock gets to slide around willy-nilly in there.  That's a great endorsement for Trojan.  Meh.  So $1,000, and we don't have any contestants yet, do we?  We have a few contestants.  We had the Jackie Broad from yesterday, I guess, right?  Yeah, she's entering.  We got Lady Trucker.  And Lady Trucker. 
[00:58:00]  Wow, this contest is fucking rocking.  Look, we're going to pick three finalists.  Three is you're going to get to come in the studio, and then we'll date one of you.  Although you have to get to New York on your own.  We're not going to fly people here.  And you know what dating leads to, Sam?  Well, I mean, if it goes well.  Sex and $1,000 means prostitution.  The $1,000.  Meaning, this is our first prostitution contest.  The $1,000 is for the date.  If it leads to sex, it leads to sex.  I don't know.  Jimmy, can we get a flow chart, please? 
[00:58:30]  You're the king of the flow chart.  $1,000 for a date means what?  Well, hard to say, because you're paying for the companion's time only.  Yeah, that's exactly right.  Now, if there's no guarantee of sex, literally, the date could go out with Bobo, eat a burger.  Yeah.  If she can hold it down while listening to him talk.  His ramblings.  And talk and go home without sex.  So, technically, no, because if she wants to fuck him, she will.  Let's be honest.  That's not looking good.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  Unless, all of a sudden, he sends somebody else as him.  First comes love, then comes marriage.  Then, you know, with a nice of Bobo.  Bobo's dick in a meat grinder.  Had a miscarriage.  Sorry.  No, no.  But you can see where the flow chart does lead to prostitution.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's money in it.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  So, Sam, this is a prostitution contest.  It's not, because...  We should call it that.  As I said, the ladies are not required to have sex with Bobo in any way.  They don't even have to give him a kiss at the end of the date if they don't want to. 
[00:59:30]  Sure, they won't.  But if they fall in love with Bobo, and that's a major possibility...  What about a handjob under the table while they eat their burger?  Not required.  Is that possible?  It's possible.  It's not for you.  From Bobo?  Wait, yeah.  And you're the chaperone.  What if one of these fucking loose whores wins the contest and decides she really wants  to give Bobo a fucking handy under the table?  Are you going to stop this as the chaperone of the contest?  Shit, no.  The chaperone.  Hell no.  Yeah, wait till you get the losses.  Your dream date in? 
[01:00:00]  Puerto Vallarta, Mexico!  Oh, they ought to send them there.  And we have more contestants, I've just been told.  About a half dozen more.  Can we see pics?  They're sent to me at my Gmail address.  Yes, we can.  And we're looking at possible locations.  This was discussed yesterday.  Oh, boy.  Let's hear the locations.  So far, at first, Pizza Place was brought up as a possible dating location, but...  Original race or famous race?  Original famous. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, right.  Travis and I discussed it further.  And we're thinking a Dave and Buster's date may be perfect.  Well, Dave and Buster's could be good.  There's a lot of action.  Of course, we all remember the Anthony Nicolini, Dave and Buster's extravaganza.  So, it works out for couples.  That's where love happens.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You could win shit for your chick.  What is that?  What is that?  That's a lovely young lady whose name I'm not going to mention. 
[01:01:00]  No, I couldn't see.  Like, the picture's not big enough.  Expand that picture.  Oh, no.  It's big enough.  See, I meant the picture.  Oh, the picture itself is not big enough.  Oh, see how we work well together?  There it is.  She's in the contest.  Yuck.  Look, she's way out of Bobo's League.  That's good.  She's not bad.  Yuck.  She just entered the contest yesterday.  You might need glasses, Jimmy.  No, no, I see her.  She's got a nice little body.  Who's the next one?  What?  Let me see.  She's not bad.  A little body. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Why not?  Well, I thought that was Carlisi.  All right, let's see.  Which one?  Let me see if I can see in this picture which one she is.  Okay, it's the blonde.  The blonde over there.  That's pretty good for anyone.  Hey, the blonde's all right, man.  Now we're tacking.  Hey, Jim Florentine.  How are you, sir?  Jim Florentine.  Joining the Pogram. 
[01:02:00]  Any other pictures?  That blonde's all right.  She's the first one that looks like she's female.  She entered?  She's cute, man.  Yeah, she's all right.  Where's that bitch from?  That's the same blonde right there.  Whoa.  Come on now.  What's going on there?  I think we might have a finalist.  I think we got a ringer, as they say.  Although, there's still another over a week to enter, so.  Any more pictures of her?  I want to see her.  And she likes golf.  What is she saying?  We could read her entry, can't we?  Sure.  Read her entry.  Well, I'm 29.  Bullshit.  I live in Iowa, but am willing to come to New York for the chance to win a life-changing 
[01:02:30]  evening, for the worse, I assume, with the insufferable tool that is Bobo.  Nice.  I'm a pretty avid O&A fan and have been for a long time, so it's cool there's a contest  for non-Sandy Kane-looking bitches to get on the show, even if it means spending the  majority of the time with Bobo.  I think it'll be pretty cheap entertainment to listen to that little dummy stutter out  sentence fragments.  As long as there is no chance of him drugging me and dragging my lifeless body to the Queen's 
[01:03:00]  Motor Lodge, this could be fun.  I like it so far.  I'm cool with him chugging his crank while staring at my tits over a nice pasta dish  and cocktail at F.H.  Riley's.  If that doesn't say fuck it, oh, I don't want prostitution to Bob at F.H.  Riley's.  Yes, usually F.H.  Riley's is only for drugs.  Motherfucker.  That just shut me down.  But there's some prostitution in there, Sam.  And this pretty much...  Wait, hold on.  Bobo's going to pull his pud while looking at her tits.  That's prostitution.  No, she's willing to let him do that for free, and then the $1,000 is for the trip to 
[01:03:30]  Dave and Boston's.  I love her.  Yeah, there's some prostitution.  Yeah, she seems like a good sport.  Funny.  Good sport.  What else does she say?  And this pretty much sums up why I want to go out with Bobo.  I honestly couldn't think of any more or better reasons than this.  I'm not working with much here.  It's Bobo.  Fuck.  She's pretty hot, man.  She's got a great chance.  She's got a little bit of sense of humor going on there, right?  Here's the next one.  Is this another one?  That's the same.  That's that pig.  Okay.  What do we got there? 
[01:04:00]  Let's see.  Okay.  Oh, shit.  What the hell is this?  I don't like chicks with props.  Get the gun.  Show them where it's at.  Oh, the gun?  Yeah.  That's not a prop for her.  If you notice the racial background, that's just what she carries.  Are you very confused with that picture?  It's like a purse.  You're confused with that picture, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you're digging the gun, but you're not digging the racial makeup.  No, actually, she's not bad.  She's very light.  I like that.  Yeah.  Flip that pic.  Wow, what is she about? 
[01:04:30]  God, Bobo's getting some fucking snatch.  So what's the deal?  He's going to get laid by one of these girls?  Thank you.  No.  It's a prostitution.  We don't know if they're going to fuck him.  She's not black.  Is she?  Is she making a black nation?  Make the picture bigger.  And I said bigger.  She's pretty.  And then go down on the face.  She's pretty.  Go down on the face.  Let me see.  Oh.  She looks a little more Arab.  Yeah.  She looks like a fucking, like a Japanimation almost.  Like a.  Yeah, yeah.  The anime chick.  Oh, yeah.  She looks like a problem.  I think she's some type of either Middle Eastern background or like Indian or something 
[01:05:00]  like that.  She's got that look where even without mascara on, they look like they're wearing mascara  kind of thing.  Right.  Those eyes.  Yeah.  Very pretty, too, though.  This has really turned into a contest for a little Bobo.  Now it is.  Go down there.  Let me see.  Let me see that body, man.  Let me see that body.  I bet that girl's got to shave that pussy every three hours.  Right.  Because it keeps growing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She's hoping her pussy gets cancer. 
[01:05:30]  She's all right, man.  I'm going to read what she has to say.  Quarantine.  You think there's a prostitution contest, right?  Just what you're hearing.  A thousand dollars for a date with Bobo.  What do you think that says?  Oh, so they win a thousand after going on a date with them.  They're just going to...  Isn't that prostitution?  Dave and Buster's.  Yeah.  Is there anything wrong with that?  No, I don't think there's anything wrong with that, Sam.  What's wrong with that?  It's illegal.  Do you know we send management at this point on our show?  No.  It's not illegal.  Prostitution?  She's not going here, give me the money, and then I'm going to suck your dick. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, okay.  There's a dinner involved.  Right.  So there's a buffer in there in between.  But as soon as one of these broads yanks is cranked, then it's officially prostitution, Sam.  Don't you understand that?  If the yank is cranked, it's because they're fond of him.  They're falling in love, not because...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Of the thousand.  When I put an extra thousand dollars up...  Well, then you're hiring, and that's prostitution.  So maybe they're going to really like them, though.  You don't know.  They get a thousand from SiriusXM, and then if they yank his crank, then I'd give a thousand. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  Well, now you're...  If she doesn't look him in the eye when she's yanking his crank, then it could be prostitution.  Yank?  Oh, really?  Well, yeah.  I mean, I've had that before where a girl didn't want to do it, but she did it, and she  wouldn't even look.  I go, you don't have to look me in the eye.  She just looks away?  I'm just glad it's my hand.  That is not my hand this time.  This chick is a Filipino model.  Yeah, she's pretty hot, man.  From Hawaii, living in Pennsylvania.  Moved to the U.S. when she was 18.  By the way, excuse me, Sam.  What a shitty decision to go from Hawaii to Pennsylvania.  Yeah, what the fuck? 
[01:07:00]  Who the fuck's in Honolulu and says, I hope Pittsburgh has apartments available?  I'm an idiot.  I would like to go on a date with Bobo because I believe it would boost his confidence to  be with somebody who doesn't look like a member of his inbred family.  That's funny.  Sam, we need this.  A lot of people want pictures of these women, especially the blonde we just talked about  and the Filipino one we're looking at now.  Okay.  But I think we need their permission before we can tweet their pictures.  Yeah, we'll get their permission.  I bet it's already put in there.  We'll double check.  If we have permission, we'll tweet them. 
[01:07:30]  All pictures sent will become property of blah-di-blah-di-blah.  Yeah.  I just want to do the right thing.  People will be able to use your image, blah-di-blah-di-blah.  Yeah, but let's make sure.  You're right.  Maybe some of these girls don't want their pictures.  I would like to go on a date with Bobo because I believe it boosts confidence.  Someone doesn't remember his inbred family.  She's a very confident girl.  A little full of herself a little bit.  At the very least, I'll make good radio as he attempts to win me over.  I also like to shoot guns and just started my background check for my first AR-15, Stag Arms. 
[01:08:00]  By the way, I'm fluent in English, so it won't be hard to understand me while on the radio.  So, the image is the unedited photo for the contest.  The second photo is for Ant, even though the gun is a fake and he's not into my skin tone.  No, that's not true.  You're getting a bad reputation out of you.  That's not true.  I know Filipino chicks, you know, that they're a little darker, but I like that.  No, I like that. 
[01:08:30]  You don't like the white girls, huh?  She looks crazy.  No, I like white girls.  I'm, like, totally into white girls.  That's it.  Yeah.  Never had a darkie before.  No.  Never.  I'm just not into it.  There are a couple that I've met over the years that, yeah, I would.  There had to be one in the back of a strip club when you're getting a lap dance.  No, those were the worst.  Those were always the worst.  I remember I was in one of those fucking back rooms with some Russian chick and she was just, like, my type, you know? 
[01:09:00]  And she's grinding away and shit like that.  You know, strip club shit.  Yeah.  And some black chick comes over to just hone in, because I was throwing money out like a fucking champ that night.  Right.  And the vultures you get in strip clubs when they see, like, that you got some money.  Uh, and this black chick comes over and she stands on the armrests of the chair and leans over and before her pussy got within literally like a foot and a half from my face, I started getting a waft. 
[01:09:30]  And then she got even closer to where I, I swear, I was turning my head side to side like fucking the cop in Reservoir Dogs when Michael Madsen's got the gun in his face and going,  Like her pussy was feeding your lima beans?  Yeah.  I was Marvin Nash.  That was horrible.  There is a smell.  I didn't like it.  There is a smell that comes with that. 
[01:10:00]  You know, I'm sure it's not, uh, I'm sure it's not every chick.  But the smell is the trade-off, man.  It scarred you for life.  Yeah, she was just sweaty and yuck and fucking, and it's like, don't hone in on my fucking nice white Russian chick.  She said, uh, the money, I make the, I make the fun time for you for the, you pay me the money.  The white Russian chick didn't have a waft?  No, but she was just annoying Russian.  They're the unsexiest people, personality-wise.  Terrible, yeah.  Alive.  They're fucking awful. 
[01:10:30]  Buy me a drink, I, you know, will sit here and talk to you very annoyingly.  You put those two girls together, you got a broad though, man.  Because the black girl will give you the personality.  And we'll give you the ride.  Yeah, yeah.  So you put that personality in the Russian broad.  Because the white chicks never think they belong there.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm going to school, I'm doing whatever.  Of course.  You know, they're too good for the place.  The black chicks and the Puerto Ricans, the rent's got to be paid so they'll go the extra mile.  They're home.  You just got to deal with the stench. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  She was sweaty as fuck.  I was just like, oh, God, get out of here.  But no, that chick that sent the picture in, she's fine.  She's all right.  She's good, yeah, yeah.  Any more, Sam, or is that it for the contest?  Okay.  Who's this?  Who's this?  Someone just said, what the fuck is going on there?  Get the fuck out of here.  A tranny, I guess.  It's going to send a tranny.  I don't know.  With a giant cock. 
[01:11:30]  That's a massive fucking dong.  That's it for today.  All right, so the prostitution contest is doing well so far.  Yeah.  And people say, why not FH Riley's?  We don't do the prostitution thing in FH.  It's the only reason.  Well, we're going to do it here in Manhattan.  We'll go someplace very local.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Florentine, how are you, brother?  Good, man.  I like your little boy haircut.  You do.  You look like a little boy.  Really?  Yeah.  How about you and your son look exactly the same right now?  We actually have exact haircuts right now. 
[01:12:00]  Oh.  Exactly.  You do?  Yeah.  Matching haircuts.  I can't grow along anymore, bro.  There's too much going on up there.  Yeah.  I've got to keep it a little shorter.  Hey, we tried to call you the other day because of, what's his name there from Warren?  Oh, Janie Lane.  Janie, yeah.  Yeah.  We just interviewed him three weeks ago.  No, I know.  That's why.  Yeah.  He was in good spirits, you know, and he's like, look, I'm in the program.  I got guys around me, you know, sober for a while.  Now, he didn't say exactly how long.  He's like, I'm working on new music. 
[01:12:30]  Never felt better in my life.  Did you believe him?  Yeah, because he was completely coherent and everything.  Because I've met him before where he's been completely out of it.  Right.  But that's always the story of an addict, you know?  And then, usually when they relapse, I mean, we don't know exactly what happened, but they  found vodka and pills.  I guess, you know, they always think they could put in as much as they used to when they take  time off and they can't.  And that's what really fucks them up.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I guess that's true, huh?  Right.  Because I used to drink a bottle of vodka and take, you know, 15 Percocets, you know, when 
[01:13:00]  I built up all that resistance.  And then they'll do it for six months or whatever.  And then they do it that night.  And that's when things go awry.  Because I always wonder why these guys drop out of nowhere like that sometimes.  That's what usually happens.  That makes sense.  Yeah.  So, it's too bad, man, because he was a good dude, you know?  Even, look, he was the singer and war and everyone made fun of him, Cherry Pie or whatever.  But, you know, they put out some decent, too.  In that era, it was, you know, in that time, they were a good band.  I hate that he distances, used to distance himself from that song. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, I don't know why.  Don't put him on the fucking map, man.  Dude, it's the same thing with the Crank Angus thing with Special Ed.  I'll still do it.  People want to hear it.  I'll throw it in for a few minutes into my set.  Who cares?  Right.  I'm not going to walk around going, I'm never doing that again.  Fuck that.  You know what I mean?  People like that.  Yeah, you got to own it.  It's like a quick hit single.  It's a fucking, you know what I mean?  Right, yeah, yeah.  You throw it in at the end.  Ozzy plays Paranoid.  He's played it his whole career.  He's probably sick of the song, but he knows the crowd.  Like, it's two minutes and 42 seconds.  That's how much I talk about Special Ed on stage. 
[01:14:00]  That was one of the biggest fucking pop metal songs of the era.  Absolutely pop.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And Bobby Brown was in the video that the model chick that he married.  So fucking own it, man.  Yeah.  And I didn't know Warren went on without him.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's been out in a band for a while.  Then he came back in for a couple years, but they just couldn't get along.  The new singer's good, and they just put a new record out.  It was pretty good.  But is anyone paying attention?  You know, they do a bunch of festivals, and they play over in Europe.  In Europe, the 80s metal is still big.  Yeah.  You know, these big metal festivals in the middle of Oklahoma and shit like that. 
[01:14:30]  Those bands do good.  Is the interviewer going to be on the metal show?  It's good.  They moved it up to August 27th, so it'll be Saturday, August 27th.  You were with him three weeks before he died.  Yeah, man.  I got pictures with him and everything.  That's fucked up.  That is fucked up.  You guys are opening with Iommi, right?  Yeah.  That's the first one?  Yeah.  What do you fucking think?  Is it then they say Sabbath is getting back together, and I'm sure they're not?  Then it's like, maybe they are.  Well, Tony Elmi was talking to some journalist he's known in Birmingham, England, forever, 
[01:15:00]  just talking off the record, and the guy went and printed the articles.  I know.  What an idiot.  He said, you know, we got together, me and Ozzy, we wrote some songs, and it looks like  it's going to happen.  So.  You know, but we're keeping it quiet, and the guy just went out and announced it, and nothing's,  but, you know, Ozzy's still touring with his regular band.  He's doing festivals over in Europe and stuff.  So, you know, who knows what's going on.  They probably will.  I mean, those guys get antsy, they want to get out, and it's about time they do something  again.  Yeah.  I agree.  I was so heartbroken when I heard no.  I was like, fuck. 
[01:15:30]  Well, he asked Elmi on the show, like, three weeks ago, and he said, look, he goes, wouldn't  you guys like to know?  He goes, look, I wouldn't rule it out.  And I said, what's your relationship with Ozzy these days?  He goes, we talk three days a week.  We all get along great, which is the first time in a long time.  That's great.  There's too many managers and lawyers involved.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  I can only imagine.  You know, it's all like, I want this, I want this.  No, you're getting this.  So that's what always complicates the Sabbath reunions all the time.  You know, it's about the music, man, not the man.  Let's let them play.  Yeah, they do fucking love it. 
[01:16:00]  Jeez.  Hold on one second.  Tim in Jersey.  Tim?  Hey there.  Hey.  Yep.  You got my information there on your screen?  You want me to say it?  Yeah, go ahead.  This guy's a, are you about to, as in any second?  Uh, well, I'm sitting in that parking lot about the walk-in.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  This isn't as good.  He says he's about to have cameras shoved up his penis hole.  I thought he was going to do it live on the show.  Ow! 
[01:16:30]  Oh, maybe.  I don't know if the doctor's good.  I had one of those cameras.  Cannavision?  Yeah.  I had one of those cameras shoved up my nose about a week, two weeks ago.  Yeah.  I can't imagine that fucking thing going in a penis hole.  This guy has a bad HMO.  It's a disposable.  What, Tim?  I said it's probably a little smaller than the one that goes in your nose.  You better hope.  Yeah, all literal, Tim.  What are they checking for?  Well, I thought Jimmy would be interested in this.  I got that pain problem Jimmy has.  You got pee so much, right? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And every test comes back normal.  So the last test is they shove a camera up your pee hole,  then they look at your prostate and your bladder on the way up there.  I have a feeling my bladder is just hypersensitive.  I have a sensitive bladder.  He really is.  No, you got OCD.  That's why.  You drink a lot of fluids.  Yeah, yeah.  I always get confused.  I think that's what I don't like.  You have to piss right before you go on stage.  I do the same thing, but I'm not as crazy as you about that.  But it's all in your head.  I think a lot of it is.  But always pee comes out, though.  I never empty my bladder. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, well, I...  That's Kenny laughing like a lunatic in the corner.  Well, because that's the same thing.  That's the same thing when we first started doing comedy.  We'd drive to frigging Vermont to do a gig.  He'd stop every fucking 100 miles to get $6 of gas in.  So you'd always just need a little.  You would never fucking fill your tank.  It's the same thing when you're fucking pissed.  Would I really not fill the tank?  Yeah, $6.  Why?  He goes, I got to pee anyway.  Get six bucks.  Another hour later, I get another six.  I got to pee.  I have no idea.  I still haven't figured out to this day.  I'm still angry about it 20 years later. 
[01:18:00]  Why do we have to stop that much?  Why would you do that?  I keep a Gatorade bottle in my car.  I whizz in that, and I fucking fill my tank.  And you just keep going.  And I'm there an hour earlier.  I pull the Gerard Depardieu and just piss on the floor mats.  Why wouldn't you fill up your car and then stop just to pee?  I don't remember.  I was probably scared.  What's that about?  I probably fucking didn't want to spend as much.  I wasn't making much money back then, man.  I was making fucking 50 bucks a gig, 25 bucks a gig.  So you're hoping the $6 would get you all the way to...  And then you realize, oh, fuck, I'm going to have to use a few more bucks for my pocket. 
[01:18:30]  All regular unleaded?  My pocket money.  Well, that's why we drove with Levy, because Levy was always drunk, and we'd drive him.  And then he was so hammered.  He's like, here's some money for gas.  He'd give us like 100.  We wouldn't say anything.  Ah, nice.  Yeah.  Generous drunk.  I'm telling you, if it wasn't for Levy's alcohol problem, me and Norton probably wouldn't  have careers.  No, we probably would have dropped out in 94.  But fucking thank God Bob poured so much booze down his throat that he needed people who  were sober to drive him.  And he got us in all these clubs and got us all these gigs. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, no shit.  Oh, yeah.  This is a real thing.  Oh, yeah.  We were working like six nights a week.  We were doing comedy like six months.  Because Levy worked a lot.  Levy worked a lot.  He was a maniac.  So you were in clubs that you had no business being in.  No business.  Because of Levy.  Yeah.  No shit.  Because Bob would have me drive him or Jim drive him or the three of us, I would MC, Jim  would middle, and Bob would close.  That's a hell of a show.  Yeah.  I mean, it's better these days than it was probably back then.  I mean, but I still laugh at fucking Roy Roger's.  I literally still laugh at that joke. 
[01:19:30]  It still makes sense.  20 years later.  Yeah.  I said I used to tell her, yeah, I'm going to take this chick to the nice French restaurant  called Roy Roger's.  And I fucking, every time we pass the Roy Roger's, I'll fucking giggle and I'll think  Roy Roger's.  Just makes me laugh.  20 years later.  But I used to have some awful, Jim, I remember what I used to do about, I go, yeah, I know  what, because I said it never works when I get girls flowers.  I go, I know why they call it a dozen roses, because it doesn't fucking work.  It's terrible.  We all had a few.  I remember you used to do Stephen Wright. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You used to do a Stephen Wright impression.  Yeah, impression of Stephen Wright.  I don't remember the jokes, though.  They were terrible.  There was one of you where, like, I hurt my toe.  I got to call a tow truck.  Yeah.  But at the end, you'd be ashamed of yourself.  You'd go, Stephen Wright.  Thank you.  Stephen Wright.  Stephen.  You'd never feel good about it.  Oh, yeah.  I had another one.  I threw a, my dog was barking the other day, so I threw a shoe at him.  It was a hush puppy.  Did you do that?  To stop him or something.  Yeah, yeah.  It was terrible.  I must have blocked that out like a fucking bad rape memory. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, because he remembers every bad joke.  If you did it one time, then we'd bring it up 20 years later.  Jimmy will remember it.  Yeah, yeah.  I fucking, I used to say on stage, because I was, I think if I played the audio on the  show, but I was so young looking and I had a crew cut, my opening line was, I look like  the bastard son of Sinead O'Connor and Uncle Fester.  Oh, yeah.  And then I would say, I met Sinead O'Connor once, and we stood by side, we looked like  testicles.  Oh, yeah.  That was an opening one for a while.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And Governor Florio was there that night, and he came over and stood right between us. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Because he was a dick.  Dick, yeah.  And you'd do that voice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he'd stand right between us.  Not a home run.  No, huh?  I think I finally stopped doing that joke in Lancaster.  I was working with Otto, and I think he went on stage, and he just kept going, two testicles,  and George's head kept popping up, and he was just fucking mocking me, with like two  testicles.  All right, George.  All right, all right.  And I finally had to stop him.  He tugs at George's shirt. 
[01:21:30]  Wow.  We got another guy that had a camera up his pee hole.  Vinny, does that hurt?  Dude, it hurts like nothing I've ever experienced.  I'll tell you, go up the nose, they numb up your nose a little bit.  And it didn't bother me at all.  They had to check my throat.  Everything's fine.  But, if you care.  But I can't imagine that they fucking numb up your dick.  They don't use a local. 
[01:22:00]  They gave me two Percocets that I took, like, on the subway, on the way to 96th Street.  I go to the urologist.  They go, yeah, normally guys under 40 scream, so just so you know.  And this camera is like, you know, like the antenna on your car?  Holy shit.  It's about that long, and it goes all the way in your bladder where he pokes around.  Holy shit.  How long does it take to get in there?  I don't know, 15 seconds.  And it was the worst pain ever? 
[01:22:30]  I've had it done twice.  It is the worst pain ever, guys.  Holy shit.  Then, when he finishes, he shoved the catheter back up there, and they do a reverse where  they fill up your bladder with water to see how much it can take.  So, they're filling it up, and he's going, all right, I'm going to keep pumping in water.  You tell me when you absolutely can't take anymore.  I'd rather have cancer.  Then, he put another catheter up my asshole. 
[01:23:00]  Just for fun.  Yeah, what, did he pick you up like a fucking, like a bag?  I like a luggage.  Holy shit.  What's the one up the ass for?  Yeah.  Well, there's a little sensor on your prostate, because I guess when you're peeing, something  pulses, kind of like a pulse.  So then, after they fill up my bladder, there's this toilet seat in the middle of the room that's  got like a graduated cylinder under it, that I then have to like empty in, empty back into  with the water they pumped into me, while this thing up my ass is testing like the pulse 
[01:23:30]  rate.  And what'd they find out?  Nothing.  They found nothing out.  I would have loved for them to tell me, Vince, you have cancer, because then at least it would  have been worth it to have that fucking cancer.  But wait, what if your pulse is off, like what if you're pulsing or something?  Is that what happens?  Like the little prostate sensor could be a little bit off, and it could think that you have  to pee when you don't?  I guess.  That's what I have.  I wound up having, I think he said I had prostatitis, which was caused by stress and sitting down 
[01:24:00]  too much.  On a bike seat.  That might be where I am.  On a cock.  Yeah.  Or a fist.  That's why guys don't go to the doctors, man.  Fuck that shit.  See you guys later.  That's a camera up there, P-hole.  We got, well, here we go, guys.  This one didn't work out too well.  Oh.  John in Jersey, go ahead, buddy.  What up, boys?  Hey.  Yeah, I had to get that test done a little while back, because I had some blood in my 
[01:24:30]  urine.  And we lost that.  I'm just, I'm getting woozy.  And we lost Jake.  I need some feedback.  He's out too.  Go ahead.  They take you into this room.  It looks like a dungeon with some, I don't know.  It was scary as hell.  And they put you on the table.  Your feet are up in these stirrups.  It's like 20 below, so you're not even bringing your A game.  And the nurse didn't look that bad, so, you know, I was looking like shit. 
[01:25:00]  They put this Novocaine jelly up there to start you out that burned like battery acid.  And then he starts to insert the camera, which was about the diameter of a Bic pen.  And as...  Gotta love technology.  We gotta get that shit smaller.  Yeah, that fucking shit was horrible, man.  As he's putting it through, he gets to about the prostate. 
[01:25:30]  And I was like a Capri Sun when you're trying to get that straw in that little fucking hole.  My ass was lifted about two feet off that table.  I screamed like a little bitch.  And the doctor started yelling at me,  You're gonna hurt yourself.  Fuck you, you're hurting.  There's gotta be a better way.  You're trying to shove something through a fucking muscle that's been trained since I was two to stay closed. 
[01:26:00]  And, uh, so, long story short, afterwards,  he failed to tell me that I'd be farting out of my dick for about fucking 12 hours.  I would fucking...  That would make it worth it.  Just stand over and put your dick in her face and cut gasses in her eye?  Like a fucking cockhole?  Wait, you could fart out of your penis?  Well, they pump a bunch of air in there.  Oh, yeah, so that's gotta get out of there.  Does it sound like a balloon when you let it go?  When they take it out, you go to piss, it burns like fucking razor, like you're pissing razor blades and you're farting out of your dick and it was horrible. 
[01:26:30]  And then I wound up getting a kidney infection from it anyway.  Oh, motherfucker.  All right.  It sucks.  But, hey, good luck.  To that guy, right?  Punching out, boys.  Why am I shifting the conversation to dick stories?  This is what we live for, you dope.  Dick stories.  Hold on a minute.  Greg.  Ope.  What's wrong with you?  My problem with you, Ope, is you're always demanding the conversation rotates around you and what you want to talk about. 
[01:27:00]  That's exactly what happens in the show.  No, it is, Ope.  You're focused on these dick stories, but you got Florentine right there and he's telling great stories.  And we're going to get back to Florentine, you cunt.  These are good fucking stories, you cunt.  Let's go to Brian in Cherry Hill.  Brian.  Hi, boys.  Hey.  I just had this shit done twice recently, and to the guy that's about to go through it, the worst part is this. 
[01:27:30]  The first time you have to take a fucking piss, it feels like those fishing hooks, like those three hooks on one hook,  it feels like that shit's tumbling out of your fucking cunt.  Oh, my God.  And it's literally like you got tears in your fucking eyes.  I, I, I, I can't, I can't.  You can't handle this?  No, it's, it just sounds so painful.  There's another 10 waiting to get on.  No shit.  There's another 10.  Would you have this done, Florentine?  No.  No.  I haven't even gotten an ass exam yet. 
[01:28:00]  You didn't do the ass exam?  No.  Are you getting up there?  Yeah, but I don't care.  Is it almost ass exam time?  I don't care.  I don't care.  No?  You've never had a finger up there?  You know.  I mean, doctor-wise?  No, never doctor-wise.  Wow, really?  You should do it.  You're at that age where it's going to help you cum.  No?  No, I just never have.  I don't even have a doctor.  I don't even go.  You don't go to a doctor?  Why?  Nothing wrong. 
[01:28:30]  Well, preventative medicine, Jim.  That's a good one.  No, it is a good point.  Wait until something happens.  Yeah, there's nothing wrong.  Why am I going to go?  Because you can go find something and go, oh, you should do it.  Yeah.  They don't fucking know.  You're right.  I just eat healthy and, you know.  Yeah.  Drink a little and whatever.  That's it.  Yeah, what am I going to do?  Our grandparents lived today.  We're 90.  They fucking barely went to a doctor.  There was no medicine.  No.  They just dealt with it.  Yeah, they fucking smoked.  They smoked.  Exactly.  They smoked.  They drank.  They had a lot of stress.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Dad would come home and beat the shit out of them. 
[01:29:00]  They wouldn't say anything.  That's got to tear your insides apart.  It's not a bad way to live.  Just think about it and stuff, you know.  It's not a bad way to live your life.  You shut up and stay in the corner over there.  I'll talk to you when I don't feel like it.  Because as soon as you go to a doctor, their whole job is to find some weird little fucking thing.  Yeah, put you on your medication.  Refer you to some other doctor, one of his cronies, so they all share the fucking wealth of the insurance money.  Yeah, keep putting on your medication.  Now you've got to be on it the rest of your life.  Yeah, yeah.  Go on that.  Go on this.  Fuck you.  Get heartburn once.  You've got to take a pill the rest of your life. 
[01:29:30]  No, I'll fucking deal with it.  I won't eat the Mexican tomorrow night.  I'll be fine.  Yeah.  Back in the old days, what'd you do?  There were no pills.  You swigged down some Pepto.  That was it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm fine.  You had a nice shiner.  You just stayed in the house for like three, four days.  You didn't go to the doctor.  A shiner.  Well, you made sure supper was warm.  Yeah.  The old days, chicks were great.  Your fucking husband would punch him in the face.  She'd put ice on his knuckles. 
[01:30:00]  You want one more?  Aaron in Indiana.  Aaron.  Hey, yeah.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Maui.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I was like 12 or 13, I had a bad injury to like the spot between your asshole and your balls.  Your taint.  Where your reefer goes down through there.  And basically, I was on a ladder and fell.  And then I kind of hit the ladder between my legs on the way down. 
[01:30:30]  And it was just pretty bad.  But didn't find out I had the injury until about 17, 18 years old when I was trying to pee.  And it would just dribble out like I was a 90-year-old man.  And it would hurt really bad every time.  So long story short, I go to the doctor.  I have to get a urethroplasty.  So they had to slice that open and basically take the skin from inside my mouth and just sew it down into there to keep that hole open. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, wow.  The fucked up thing is they never removed it from his mouth.  It's very awkward.  So wait a minute.  So your urethroplasty closed up?  It was all the way scarred shut almost.  Oh, scarred.  Yeah, he said it was the size of a pinhole.  Holy shit.  I wonder if I have that too.  You got all this stuff, Jimmy.  Well, you fell off a ladder.  I had a problem, too, with my penis.  47 surgeries.  How many?  47.  47 operations. 
[01:31:30]  Wow.  By the way.  I don't think Florentine's digging this conversation.  I don't care.  I think I've learned something about you today.  What?  You get squeamish about medical shit and doctors and stuff?  I mean, I don't want anything in my fucking pee hole.  No.  No, of course not.  You know, when you thought you had chlamydia back in the day or a yeast infection, they always stick something in there.  That always hurt.  Why do they got to do that?  Would you let them put something in your pee hole for wrestling photos?  Depends on what it is.  We were talking about Brutus, the barber beefcake yesterday.  There's allegations that there may have been some gay sex with him and Hulk Hogan. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Well, you're lucky.  I mean, you look at those pictures of those guys.  Yeah.  It's very gay.  Jimmy's not surprised.  He said it yesterday.  Why did a lot of them pick this very flamboyant dress and stuff?  Like, Sergeant Slaughter picked, like, a military uniform, shit like that.  Like, what made somebody not want to be that guy, but go like, you know what I want to do?  I'm going to put on tights. 
[01:32:30]  I'm going to wear, like, these flamboyant fucking, you know, feathers and shit like that.  Those were the guys that made the money in the 80s.  But why?  Because, you know, it was rockin' wrestling.  You had to go out there like a...  No, it wasn't really rockin'.  It was very femmy.  It was.  I mean, but, like, guys like Ivan Koloff just had, like, that one piece, that black.  Yeah.  Just that one stripe.  Like, Nikolai Volkov just had, like, black trunks.  Yeah, that was it.  That's it.  Ivan Putzky, same.  George Steele.  George the Animal Steele.  Yeah, just hairy, yeah. 
[01:33:00]  Now, you look at...  Dusty Road.  How about you take guys like the Rockers, right?  Right.  Now, they were supposed to be rockin', rockers.  And they dressed like that.  So even they could have an excuse.  But you'd get just the guy that would come out, you know...  Like Brutus the Barber Beefcake?  Brutus the Barber Beefcake.  Well, because he's half barber, half male stripper.  Half beefcake.  Half barber, half male stripper.  That's not what that was about.  Well, because he started as Brutus Beefcake, and he was just like a... 
[01:33:30]  He was pretty much a Chippendale, but they didn't say...  So what did he...  Why did he...  But then when he turned to a good guy, he was the barber.  Why?  Because kids like the barber.  No, they don't.  They give him a lollipop.  Oh, yeah.  That is the dumbest gimmick ever, if you think about it.  It's like, what do you want to be?  Oh, how about we make a barber character that runs out of the ring?  Well, that was when they had a cop, and they had a Mountie, and they had, you know, everybody.  By the way, Keith...  Big boss man.  That's right.  Where is he now? 
[01:34:00]  What's he doing?  Didn't he get into a skydiving accident, like he fell on his face or something?  No, he was on the beach, Bruce Beefcake.  He smashed his face up because one of those paragliders hit him in the face with their  knees while they were...  Yeah.  Oh, he wasn't even in the thing?  No, he was just like standing on a dock or something, and somebody shattered his entire  face with their knees.  Why did he move out of the way?  You could see those things coming.  He's probably on coke or something.  I don't know. 
[01:34:30]  I thought it was a big bird.  Fucking idiot.  By the way, Keith Robinson was in yesterday.  I thought it was a flying cock.  And he said that picture looked like a fat you, which made me laugh.  Is that what he said?  Yeah.  That looks like fat Florentine.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  That's funny.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Well, goddamn.  She also said the Ultimate Warrior was gay.  Hulk Hogan's wife said this.  Yeah, well, the Ultimate Warrior said that.  Hulk used to take his wife around, and all the wrestlers would fuck his wife, and he  would sometimes watch, get involved, cuckold, and she said, no, that never happened, and 
[01:35:00]  I think this guy that said that, Warrior, is gay.  Yeah, I mean, they try to keep, there's a lot of secrets, I think.  I've talked to the Iron Sheik before, and there's allegations that a lot of those guys  running the wrestling and the wrestlers were gay, and he just doesn't see his pants  at the time.  I didn't see anything.  I just drank, so I don't know, but he definitely knows his insinuation.  Come on, Clutch.  A lot of the top guys. 
[01:35:30]  I fuck you and humble you.  Nikolai Volkov actually has a lot to say when you talk to him about guys who were gay back  in the day.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I've talked to him about it.  Volkov, yeah?  What has he said?  Well, I mean, there's a long-standing rumor about Pat Patterson.  Oh, yeah.  Pat Patterson.  His real name is Pat Patterson, but he changed it.  All right, Chip.  Oh, God.  But there are rumors about him in the Brooklyn Brawler.  The Brooklyn Brawler?  Yes.  There's also rumors about Tony Gurria. 
[01:36:00]  Remember him?  Yes.  What was his name?  Did he have a name, though?  Tony something?  No, he was just...  Tony Gurria.  But he was one of those guys like an S.D. Jones that kind of lost most of the time.  I had his brother gone.  Supposedly it was.  I knew that wasn't far behind.  But supposedly he was captain of the WWF for a reason.  Oh, to keep somebody happy?  Yeah, keep a lot of guys happy.  Oh, well, you know, yeah.  And there were, like, back many years ago, I think in the 80s, even the late 80s or something, 
[01:36:30]  there were a couple of ring boys, I think, was just, like, young guys who set up the ring  and stuff who tried to sue and said Pat Patterson had taken liberties.  Yeah.  What liberties did they say he took?  I don't know the specifics, but I would assume at least oral sex would have been involved.  Did he suck at their young cocks or they were sucking his cock?  He would probably, I mean, he'd probably be down for either one.  In your fantasy, what would happen?  If you were a ring boy, let's say you were a fucking twinkish, shirtless ring boy. 
[01:37:00]  I would prefer Pat Patterson to give me a blowjob than for me to give money.  How about if he was sucking your dick and he laid you back and all of a sudden you hurt  his belt under, and then all of a sudden he lowered his older gentleman dick and balls.  And he flipped around so he could do each other.  He smelled like bad perfume.  And you smelled an oniony asshole over your face because he's been in that seat all day.  This bar will smell like high karate.  He fucking smacks him with high karate on you. 
[01:37:30]  He's a legend, though.  He's the first Intercontinental Champion.  So you gotta respect that.  Big stomach is rested on your chest.  And then he even stops sucking you.  Like, he just puts his face, your dick is resting against his face.  And he just starts humping your mouth with a dog on the carpet.  Oh, shit.  Fucking your ring boy mouth.  I'm not a ring boy.  And then you hear him just go like, God, put a finger on my ass.  And you pretend you don't hear it.  And then he just reaches back and he slaps your hand and he puts it. 
[01:38:00]  And then you put a finger on his ass and he cums immediately.  He's demanding.  Yeah, because you know he's done that a million times.  He knows all the moves.  Yeah, yeah.  He works for public before Vince gets there.  He knows the ring boys.  Just having a gig is a lot more important than, you know, their...  Dignity.  Dignity, exactly.  Vince always scolds him for doing it.  Yeah.  He always knows when there's a crying ring boy and little cum drops on the rug in the office.  God damn it, Pat.  Yeah.  Pat, look, you gotta knock it off with the ring boys. 
[01:38:30]  Sam, on Instant Feedback, a clip from the Donahue show about the WWF sex scandal.  I think Donahue did a whole fucking show on this.  I think I've seen that.  Is that new?  No.  I'm just kidding.  What you do on your own goddamn time is your business.  But you can't be fucking the ring boys.  No fucking the ring boys, Pat.  The turnbuckle's covered with your cum.  We gotta clean it up before every match.  Why would he cum on the turnbuckle? 
[01:39:00]  I don't know, because he'd grip onto the corner.  Oh, yeah.  As a young ring boy shoves four fingers up his ass, and then diddles his taint with this  thumb.  I didn't believe the sexual harassment.  And I bet you Sam, if Sam was the ring boy, Pat would have him pinned up against the corner  turnbuckle, and he'd have a hand on each rope.  And he'd be kissing Sam ferociously while another ring boy knelt behind him and ate his  asshole.  Oh, shit.  And he'd make them switch back and forth.  Would the ring boy go against the ropes to get a running start? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, he'd get a running start.  Yeah.  And slide right in there.  And he'd put his face in his ass.  He'd step first.  He'd step on the fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  To make that loud sound.  Sam would be the one he kissed more, because he had a lifesaver breath.  Aw.  Lifesaver breath.  Jesus.  I like the red ones.  Let's take a listen to this thing.  The harassment exists in your workplace?  I believe that...  Do you believe that sexual harassment exists in your workplace?  I believe that there is a possibility of sexual harassment existing everywhere. 
[01:40:00]  I asked directly if it was in the World Wrestling Federation.  And I don't want it in my organization.  I don't want it.  I'd like to reiterate the question.  Do you believe there is sexual harassment amongst the wrestlers or employees at the World  Wrestling Federation today?  There is a possibility of that.  That's why I have these independent investigators to come in.  And who are these independent investigators?  Fairfax Group Limited.  And I would like to hear what you have to say.  And everyone has to say it.  McMahon Investigations.  Would you therefore believe that because of all these allegations coming forward and 
[01:40:30]  more and more corroborating evidence proving that there's no doubt sexual harassment is  running rampant in the World Wrestling Federation, that you are definitely...  It's running wild, brother.  Do something about that.  Hold that for a second.  Who is this guy questioning him like this?  Yeah.  I'm amazed Vince would go with this.  But Vince is actually...  Plus, I'm amazed they have the phone number of the Phil Donahue show on the TV.  Yeah, look at that.  So anyone could call in.  But Vince is fucking...  This guy's making Vince uncomfortable.  Yes.  Vince is not in a dominant position here at all.  No, this was 92. 
[01:41:00]  Because this is a surprise attack, you think?  Yeah, Vince is usually right in their face.  Vince answered the question and the guy grilled him and he's like, well, yeah, no, I do.  It's possible.  Vince is nervous.  The more recent Vince would have leaned over in his chair in the guy's face and go,  you make allegations like that against me, I'll have your ass.  They're saying this guy, Murray.  Oh, God.  Murray confronts Vince on Donahue about allegations that he was fired from WWF after refusing to  sleep with then Vice President Pat Patterson.  So they know each other. 
[01:41:30]  So Vince may know this guy is absolutely right.  Absolutely right.  Why would Vince agree to this?  Maybe he didn't know he was going to be there.  It may have been the steroid thing, too, because this was right when the steroid scandal  was breaking.  So maybe Vince thought he would clear his name.  I'll play that, though.  What's this guy's name?  Murray Hodgson.  H-O-D-G-S-O-N.  Hodgson.  Mr. Hodgson.  Hodgson.  I'm guessing if in fact that is the case, why wouldn't I do something about it? 
[01:42:00]  Why would I risk what we have?  Because you haven't done anything about it until it became public, because you thought  it was underwater.  Because I had no knowledge of it.  I made knowledge of it to you when I was fired, and you just blew it off and let me  go.  I retained a lawyer.  You were fired because you were not very good.  You were not a very good announcer.  You could not.  That's the only reason why you were fired.  You could not make the transition from radio to television.  That is the only reason why you were fired.  I would like to remind you, sir, that I have a two-year contract.  Two years.  You also have a clause in your contract that states, and as you know, you were hired on 
[01:42:30]  a trial basis.  I was not hired on a trial basis.  You also have a...  You do not have a contract?  Mr. McMahon, I have a two-year deal with your firm.  In fact, you will note, in a clause, it states very clearly, and I have it outlined for all  to see here today, that you can be fired almost at whim if, in fact, you're not doing a good  job.  You did a horrible job.  That's the only reason why you were fired.  That's it.  Maybe I should point out, first and foremost, that might be your inability to pick good talent.  It could be.  You had a national talent search, Vince McMahon.  It could be. 
[01:43:00]  You advertised in Billboard magazine and across many different media sources, searching for  one man that could be the new...  You know who got this job that the guy got fired from?  He said you couldn't make the transition from radio to television.  That's when Vince was looking for a radio guy.  It's Todd Pettengill's job.  Oh my God, really?  Todd got it after this guy?  Todd is the guy who ended up with this job.  Yes.  I wonder if Todd had to fucking suck off Pat Patterson.  Hold that clip right there.  Because we got a guy on the line that swears he sued. 
[01:43:30]  The WWF back in 1992.  Tom in Manhattan.  What's up, buddy?  What's going on, guys?  I never give interviews, very, very rarely.  But I'm a fan, and I just was listening this morning.  I sued in 1992, just real quickly.  Pat Patterson never did anything with any ring boys.  I was a young kid.  I started helping set up the ring back in the 80s.  It was Mel Phillips and Terry Garvin.  Wait, who are they?  I don't know who those guys are.  That says you.  It's public record.  All right, Tom, we've got to slow down a little bit here. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, you can't just start spitting out names on the radio.  We've got to know who these people are.  I got you.  Okay.  Can you give us your last name so we can Google it?  Just Google WWE.  Tom Cole.  All right, just because if it's public record and this is you.  No, you'll see it all over the place.  But I just want to just state that Pat Patterson never did anything with young boys.  And Vince, I'm the one.  You know, I was in the audience during the Donahue interview. 
[01:44:30]  They got rid of Mel Phillips, who was in charge of the ring crews and was a ring announcer.  And Terry Garvin, who was, you know, he was like a manager for the WWE, WWF.  Not, you know, a TV manager, but behind the scenes.  So, you know, they harassed me and other young kids, boys, teenagers.  But they did get rid of them.  And they never came back to work.  Now, wait.  You're saying that.  Were they found guilty of that?  Are you just alleging that?  Or was that actually proven?  The WWF looked into it, and they found it to be found. 
[01:45:00]  They found everything I said.  But they weren't found guilty.  They just got fired.  Yeah, they just got the boot?  They got the boot.  Well, I don't know if that's true or not.  How old were you when you were working for the WWF?  I started on and off from the time I was about 13, 14 years old.  And what happened to you, allegedly?  The guy, Mel Phillips, had a foot fetish.  But there was never anything more than a foot fetish.  So I know it's funny, guys.  Are you sure you're not thinking of Mel from Alice? 
[01:45:30]  Anyway, and Terry Garvin.  The funny thing is, the guy would offer him pictures of Florentine.  So the guy had a foot fetish.  And the other guy, Terry Garvin, he was the guy who tried to use his job as an instrument to get up.  Wait, who's Terry Garvin?  I don't know.  He was an office man.  Dude, you might be telling the truth.  I'm not saying you're lying.  I'm only saying that we can't just start spitting out last name allegations on the radio. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, we've got to protect our shit.  Hold on, but we just have to make sure.  No, I know you do, but I'm sure Sam could do it now and a hundred things will come up.  Is that Terry Garvin?  That's Terry Garvin.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Oh, boy.  That's pretty flamboyant right there.  It's a good name from Terry because it could go either way.  I've got to go back to work.  All right, buddy.  I could call back, but I've got to go back to work.  All right, Tom.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Oh, man.  I want to talk to that fire guy, man.  Yeah, but I don't know if any of this stuff is true.  It's like he's just saying that.  I would rather investigate it first.  Is his name all over the website? 
[01:46:30]  Tom Cole?  Sam?  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  I've got a bunch of Tom Cole stuff.  Yeah, he's a merry old soul.  A merry old soul was he.  Yeah.  He'd call for his pipe.  He'd call for his ball.  And he'd get fucked in the ass instead.  Old Tom Cole had to fill the old hole and cocks and cum in it.  Old Tom Cole drank cum out of a bowl.  Pat Patterson fingered his tookus. 
[01:47:00]  Pat Patterson didn't do anything.  I know.  It seems Pat Patterson's.  That guy just pretty much vindicated Pat Patterson.  He's the first intercontinental champion for God's sake.  Of course he is.  But we got the guy to talk.  That one guy had a foot fetish.  Yeah, Mel.  I want to know what happened after that.  Because then the other guy came in.  Mel.  And then good old Mel had the foot fetish.  That's what he said.  And then Terry came in.  And that's when the guy had to go back to work.  I want him to call back.  Mel was sucking them tootsies, I guess.  And what did Terry Garvin try to do?  Dirty wrestler feet. 
[01:47:30]  Do you think of worse feet to suck?  After you just built the ring and put it up.  Oh, sweaty ass crack.  Probably loves a holster's feet.  Working all day.  Men, feet, and sneakers, and union shoes.  Fucking horrible.  It smelled.  Calluses and fungus.  Good old Mel on his knees jerking off.  Rubbing his cock into the canvas.  Big black delicious hog.  Sam, the Garvin.  Who did he play? 
[01:48:00]  I think he was a wrestler way back when.  Was he the Red Rooster?  No.  That's Terry Taylor.  Oh.  All right.  Fair enough, sir.  He's not the Red Rooster.  I was just wondering.  He was an older wrestler, and then he ended up working in the back office.  Ant, you mentioned the big boss man, and John's going to tell you exactly what's going on with him.  Oh, really?  Because you don't know, sir.  I was wondering.  You don't know, sir.  You ain't, sir.  Yeah, yeah.  John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, the big boss man, he died of a heart attack back in, like, the 90s or something like that. 
[01:48:30]  You're kidding.  How did it happen?  Oh, God bless him.  Yeah, he died of a heart attack, but, uh.  Oh, no.  God, we didn't know that.  No.  First time I'm hearing this.  What about JFK?  How's he doing?  JFK.  He likes to say.  Of course he did.  Right.  We get it.  Jesus.  Nikolai Volkov is a building inspector in Baltimore.  Isn't he really?  That's what he does. 
[01:49:00]  Imagine that guy showing up.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  I'm waiting for a treat today, Florentine.  We found out yesterday.  Oh, shit.  Bruce Beefcake was collecting subway tokens in Boston.  Yeah.  Working in the subway.  Yep.  Working in the subway collecting tokens.  Really?  Yeah.  I totally got an incident with a bag of possible coke.  Yeah, there seemed to be a bag of coke.  I guess the Hulk didn't give him any hush money.  No, no, no hush money.  Yeah, if you're a token, give her out her.  Should we get those guys in the minute? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, we got a break.  Florentine, what are we promoting?  New season of That Metal Show starts this Saturday, VH1 Classic, 11 o'clock.  Tony Aomi's on.  Nice.  Janie Lane's next week, the episode that we did with him.  And then Helium Comedy Club in Philly, September 7th through the 10th.  Nice.  Very good.  Okay.  And I leave today to do tomorrow and Saturday, Utah, Wise Guys Comedy Club.  I can't do any radio out there because they're going to be doing a live remote, so I'm fucked.  Oh, Jesus.  So I'm looking forward to it.  And I have a podcast.  Go to JimFlorentine.com.  It's up on iTunes, all that stuff. 
[01:50:00]  We did that together.  That was fun, man.  Yeah.  But Florentine's continuing with us.  Yes, you can.  Just wanted to get all your plugs in.  Up next, we got Vinny and Uncle Nino from the Jersey Shore.  Stay there.  The Virus.  Sirius XM. 
[01:50:30]  Let's do this.  It's Mr. Jim Florentine on Twitter.  Speaking of Twitter, Vinny from the Jersey Shore, a friend of the show.  This motherfucker has some followers.  Oh, yeah.  What are you up to on Twitter?  Today, I think it's 1.6 million.  Well, how about you blow up our Twitters today?  How you doing?  Good. 
[01:51:00]  Vinny, you want to blow up our Twitters today or what?  Let's do it.  We could use the help.  I already tweeted you.  Yeah, I know.  I got four new followers from you.  Thank you.  Nino got Twitters.  We're going to get Nino.  Yeah, we're trying to get everyone organized.  Nino.  Florentine, that's Uncle Nino.  You'll know him by the end of this fucking thing, though, appears.  Trust me.  Oh, yeah.  Trust me.  And now you got the Uncle Nino's vino.  Yeah.  Yeah, the bottle's a little nicer than last time.  It's coming out very soon.  Very soon.  The same wine.  Let me tell you something, but the bottle's a little more, it's a better presentation than 
[01:51:30]  last time.  Wait, is he a picture on it?  Yeah.  He's going to put his picture on it.  Really?  No, no, no, no.  Now it's just a feel.  Oh, how heavenly.  Just to let people know, last time these guys were in, Brooke Shields was here as well,  and Nino brought his wine, but it was in a jug.  It was in a jug, yeah.  It was like in a milk jug or something.  Put a little bit of a bottle.  Put a little bit of a bottle.  Now it looks nice.  The presentation there.  Last time it was like fucking Jed Clampett.  This is nice.  But now it's a real label on everything.  Yes, there is, yeah.  Wow. 
[01:52:00]  We got the grapes from California, and they shipped them over.  Oh, I thought you had a vineyard out there on the old fucking...  Yeah, I was going to say, wait a minute.  The fucking...  Fresh Killed landfill.  Fucking gross great grapes.  The fuck is buried there that the grapes are growing so well.  We got two buyers in California, they buy the grapes.  Yeah, shit, no.  Jesus, man.  Yeah, Tony Grapes sends it over.  What's up this fuck, guys?  Vinny wine.  Come on, Iraq, fix the chair.  Sorry, Eric probably broke it. 
[01:52:30]  What's going on?  Come on.  Eric probably broke it.  I'm not too far.  The chair's cringy when you're out there.  What do you think he is, a midget?  He's a big gentleman.  You're not drinking anything?  Sam, open that bottle.  Open it.  It's what I'm talking about.  And what it tastes like.  Nino kind of likes to take over for it, too.  Just enjoy it.  I know, it's cool.  Vinny's the big star, you wouldn't know, because Nino's going to talk the whole fucking  time.  That was another fucking nightmare to get up here.  The last time was a fucking nightmare.  Why is that?  What happened?  We got pulled over on the way. 
[01:53:00]  We got pulled over, yeah.  My gosh.  Why?  When you come from Staten Island and you go in the H-O-V lane, H-I-V lane.  H-I-V lane.  H-I-V lane.  Yeah.  H-I-V.  You got to have easy pass.  My cousin Doug doesn't have easy pass.  Oh, so it's not only the amount of people in the car, you got to have easy pass.  You got to have easy pass.  What the fuck doesn't he have easy pass for?  I don't know.  Doug, why don't you have fucking easy pass?  What the fuck are you doing?  You're the prick.  Look at the fuck's up.  I know.  You can't get in that bottleneck at the Lincoln Tunnel.  It's the bottleneck.  I don't the government know where I'm going. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, hey, I don't need fucking...  First of all, look at this shirt.  Why don't you have easy pass?  Let's go, sir.  Hold on.  You got to get the...  You're the guy that fucks it up for everybody.  We hate you guys.  I never leave the island.  You change-throwing motherfucker.  I'm stuck on Staten Island.  I don't get off of that much.  You think it's Tony Soprano?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Tony Soprano disables all the details of theirs in the car.  So you don't have easy pass?  I don't, no.  So yeah, so the best thing is, right, we get pulled over and then the cop, like, I was  like, I'm a little fucked up. 
[01:54:00]  But I had my sunglasses on and I took them off.  And he's like, oh, I recognize you.  How you doing?  He's like, I don't know, can I have an autograph, blah, blah, blah.  And then Uncle Nino goes, hey, I'm his Uncle Nino.  Uncle Nino's in the back seat.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  The fuck?  You know how he is.  Probably like, look, we're getting out of this thing.  Why don't you just shut up for a minute?  Exactly.  Then we got to take it.  He got away with no ticket.  And Doug is like, he has his window open.  And he spits out the fucking window.  He spits out the fucking car.  The cop goes, oh, it's okay, it's okay. 
[01:54:30]  He spits out his own window.  It was one of those morning cigarette coffee.  Yeah, yeah.  From deep down in my lung.  Nice clam.  Last time.  I mean, last time.  That's about six inches.  The last fucking time.  Last year, what, six months ago?  About that.  Yeah, what the fuck?  1974.  That was a tall nightmare.  Six months ago.  A tall nightmare.  I had to take a shit.  I was fucking driving.  The fucking bus.  That was a tall nightmare.  Well, you're looking good.  I like that.  The shirt. 
[01:55:00]  Look at you.  All buttons.  Two buttons.  I just seen a dog chasing a cat.  They were both walking.  He's looking around the room.  He just says this stuff.  He's just beginning, brother.  Wait, why did you guys get pulled over?  Did you say it?  Yeah, no easy pass.  No easy pass.  No easy pass.  How did they know that?  Oh, you were going slow.  Oh, that's my man.  My man, Sam.  Sam the man.  What do you think when you're driving,  you see people with easy pass going through  and you're sitting there like,  what are you going like,  I got to get it eventually?  A little jealous.  Yeah, it's hard, right? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  But the cop's name is Ike.  So, hey, thanks, Ike.  Ike and Mike.  I thought I got it.  He'll be called on the carpet now  by his commander.  There's only one cop named Ike.  What are you doing?  I'll give you an autograph for my son.  What's his son's name?  Gordon Flesch?  Now, just let everybody know  who this poor bastard is.  All that let the famous people go.  Give up.  Yeah, let me tell you,  that wasn't a huge scandal.  Taste the difference.  In New York.  Yes, of course, literal, Jim.  You don't want us to taste his wine 
[01:56:00]  that tastes the difference.  And French oak barrels.  French oak barrels?  French oak barrels?  God damn.  What did you, did you,  French whiskey,  I don't worry about it.  You stepped it up.  You stepped it up a notch.  I'll take a sip of that, Sam.  Huh?  Sam.  That's not bad.  A little dry.  Last time was a little sweet.  Vinny, is he using your money  to start this business?  No, no, no.  I don't know.  No, no.  I'm using Bob's money.  And wine and paper cups  is always the classiest thing I can do.  What is it to Staten Island?  Like wine and paper cups. 
[01:56:30]  Let me smell it.  That's really not bad.  Oh, that's not bad.  It's not bad.  Wow, Jimmy's just winced.  I haven't smelled wine in years.  What does dry mean?  What does it dry?  I haven't drank in years.  You take a sip,  and your mouth goes...  It's a tart kind of...  It's like a fucking...  It's like you...  No, no, no.  It's probably you're putting a...  Cotton?  No, not cotton.  A pussy?  No, no, no.  A cock?  Squish grapes?  Oh, there you go.  Hey.  Preparation H.  It's in your mouth.  Preparation H.  What are you doing?  Preparation H.  Why would anybody like that? 
[01:57:00]  That's awful.  People would like a dry wine.  It's a subtle quality of a wine.  It's not the whole thing is like fucking putting alum in your mouth or something like that.  I like a fucking refreshing beverage.  I don't want to suck in...  Suck fucking...  You want a refreshing beverage, you drink iced tea.  You want to get drunk, you drink wine.  Fair point.  Probably not a great way to describe it by saying dry, but people understand out there.  A nice dry wine.  I don't know what that means.  I've only heard that.  I've never drank it.  A dry goes like a nice steak, right?  Just wine's good. 
[01:57:30]  Red meat.  Red meat.  Oh, this should pass the door with some meatballs, you know?  So you have some steak and then you fucking have dry wine after?  It sounds fucking awful.  I like this.  You drink it with it.  White wine.  White wine.  No, no.  What does white wine go with fish?  White wine.  White wine.  White wine goes with fish, right?  That's how fucking...  White wine, right?  He's asking you a question.  Does white wine go with fish?  With fish, yeah.  That's not dry, though, white wine.  Yes, it is.  Oh, it is.  Yeah, even more dry than the red. 
[01:58:00]  Women drink the white, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Right, Nino?  This is a heavy, thick red, too.  It's good, it's good.  It's like the sidewalk under Paul Castellano.  Yeah.  Hey.  I'm bringing my mob jokes out.  Hey.  Hey.  What was this?  I heard you on the radio a bit earlier.  You were talking about rats?  Rats?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You catch any?  No, no.  There's rats all over New York.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A family of rats.  You should catch them.  You get some big ones, huh?  I'm not going to catch them.  I'm going to look at them.  You can eat those fuckers.  You can eat them in Africa. 
[01:58:30]  You can eat them.  Yeah, they're called...  With fucking Nino's wine.  They go great.  Hey, rats with my wine.  It's fucking fantastic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I kind of like this.  We ate rat 10 years ago.  Really?  We had two guys come in and cook rats with us.  Oh, that's right.  How was it?  It was fucking good, Vinny.  What?  The one was horrendous.  He made like a steak, a poivre rat.  Yeah.  He gets a French chef and actually cooked up fucking rat and it was amazing.  And people went back for seconds.  It was supposed to be this goof contest where people were like, we made them eat the rat, 
[01:59:00]  but they went back and got a second fucking helping.  But then another guy came in and he was like a serial killer wannabe and his rat was horrendous.  We asked for two chefs.  We got one real chef who cooked it really nice and we got another guy who pretty much  sliced up a rat and threw it in a frying pan.  And it really goes to show you how cooking really matters because the just rat on a stick  was...  People were puking.  In a frying pan.  A little onions.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:59:30]  You slice the garlic real thin so it liquefies in the pan.  It's a good system.  Totally surprised.  Oh, good fellas.  Yeah.  Close enough.  A lot of the other.  But the rats came in live, too.  Yeah.  Really?  And the one guy...  Oh, you won't see him no more.  The one guy had a tough time...  Remember the one guy had a tough time...  Take the frying pan.  Leave the rat.  The one guy had a tough time killing his rat.  Remember that?  It was horrendous.  Oh, man.  How did he do it?  How did he kill it?  The one guy knew. 
[02:00:00]  He just fucking bopped him.  The thing was dead before he knew it.  That was the French chef.  That was Mark.  Right.  The French chef.  He knew he took the back of his knife and took the rat, held it down, and smashed the  back of its neck.  And the rat just went completely fucking dead.  This other guy is like fucking got little rat shackles.  He's torturing the fucking thing.  He's working him up, burning him with cigarette butts.  He really worked over the fucking rat.  He was slamming the rat on the table, and the damn thing went down.  The rat's confessing to shit.  Right.  He's waterboarding him. 
[02:00:30]  His eye popped out.  He's like, you made me pop your fucking eye out.  You rat motherfucker.  I would love to do that bit again, but you can't do that shit on the radio anymore.  Yeah.  The other day, my friend Doug over there, again, he ran over a family of raccoons.  Oh, family?  In front of the mother.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Were they in the easy pass lane?  You were cutting across it?  You were gone.  No easy pass, motherfucker.  The raccoons were moving faster than he was.  They were in the front of the exact same lane. 
[02:01:00]  He left me like a voicemail crying about it.  I still have it.  They are adorable, those raccoons, aren't they?  Yeah.  Love you, bitch.  That was horrible.  He was in front of the mother.  Yeah.  How many did you kill?  These guys, they're all hunters, you know?  So he played a voicemail on me.  I called him up because I felt bad.  So I was kind of like, oh, I just killed the whole family of fucking raccoons, you know?  Yeah, we're all hunters.  They're like, oh, listen, you faggy.  You sound like a faggy.  Raccoon goes great with raccoons.  How many did you kill?  I was like, oh, should I go back and run them over again in case they're still alive? 
[02:01:30]  You don't run them over again.  It was like they were kind of coming out on the road and then they stopped it.  Then they were like, fuck it.  We're going to go for it.  Ah, bad move.  Right on to my car.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Damn.  Wow.  That's all your fucking tie.  You're losing your ties now.  That's where your ties are falling off.  That happens.  Yeah, raccoon teeth are sharp.  He says it's my ties that fall off.  Right through a sidewall.  Someone's fucking killing the fucking raccoons.  Cocksuckle.  I've been listening to you guys for a while. 
[02:02:00]  And I just stopped listening.  You took me off the fucking air in the morning.  And you had that fucking guy.  Who was that guy?  Larry King or something?  You got him in the fucking morning.  Oh, the intro.  The intro.  He's insulted.  All right, all right.  What was that?  It was Larry.  Larry's the guy with the suspenders, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think he's wearing diapers for 30 years.  He's a fucking diaper.  So he doesn't listen to us.  He only listens to the intro himself.  And then goes back to bed. 
[02:02:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  So what are you doing with yourself?  Come on.  What are you?  Beside the wine.  Beside the wine.  Yeah.  Are you proud of Vinny or what?  Still doing this Jersey Shore shit?  Yeah, yeah.  I got a couple of periods coming up.  Ha, ha, ha, yeah.  Brother Vinny, yeah, I got a...  It's all about here.  It's all about here in my life, yeah.  Imagine three or four periods coming up.  And I love things cooking.  I love things cooking.  Oh, shit. 
[02:03:00]  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Jig your wine.  Jig your cook.  Jig your wine.  How was Italy, man?  Yeah.  Italy was amazing.  Florence.  You guys ever been to Florence?  No, no, man.  Fucking amazing.  We're stuck here.  Yeah, I know.  We're stuck.  It's literally the same city that it was like 800 years ago, you know, and you just...  Exactly.  Everything is still there.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Was it your first time?  First time in Italy, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you feel a connection?  Because I feel no ethnic connection whatsoever or anything, but when you go over there and  you're Italian, do you feel like, ah... 
[02:03:30]  Not really Florence.  We explored some other areas that...  Florence is like Manhattan, you know, so you feel like you're here, but there are some  other parts of Italy that are like fucking godfather too, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah.  And that's when I really felt the connection.  My mother was born there in Sicily, so I've been seeing the pictures my whole life, and  then to see the pictures in person, you know, it was an amazing feeling.  You know, her great-great-great-great-grandmother did so much fucking.  What movie is that?  I was just doing movie books.  Greatest monologue ever. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, yeah.  True romance.  True romance.  True romance.  True romance.  Look that one up someday.  What?  Your camera up.  I saw that.  Yeah, yeah.  I flew down to my hometown in St. Taggart, in Sicily.  How was that, Vinny?  Oh, it was good.  It was good.  Yeah, yeah.  It was good.  You were born there in Nino?  Yeah, I was born and raised there.  I was there.  I came in this country.  I was 13 years old.  Yeah?  1969.  As a matter of fact, yeah, 69.  75.  75.  Yeah.  Everything 75.  Everything 75.  Yeah, August 15th was my anniversary.  I'm in this country for 42 years. 
[02:04:30]  42 years?  42 years.  Did you speak a typhus?  Did they have to put you in that room?  I went to school there.  We speak Italian English.  Fool me.  Yeah.  Sicilian is like a different dialect than Italian.  And then he speaks like his own language.  Yeah.  Two languages.  Menino's language, Sicilian and Italian.  And English a little bit.  That's three.  Four.  English a little bit.  Wait, Sicilian is different than Italian?  Yes.  Much different.  Because my...  Can you shut the fuck up?  I'm waiting for that.  I'm talking this time.  You got to talk. 
[02:05:00]  Remember last time?  All right.  They told me to shut up.  My mother, they speak Sicilian.  And then when I went to Italy, everyone was like, oh, Vinny, you speak Italian, you speak Italian.  But it's a completely different language.  You're better off speaking English to Italian people than Sicilian.  Really?  That's how different the language is.  Yeah.  So they don't...  Italians don't understand Sicilians?  No.  It's kind of like...  Picture like America and then like jive or something.  You know what I mean?  Like some southern accent.  It's like black people and white people.  We just miss each other.  Creole. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  If you're trying to listen to somebody speak Creole, they live in America, but you're  like, what the fuck is...  What the fuck is...  Wait, what's Creole?  French Haitian.  Yeah, it's down in Louisiana.  Oh, okay.  It is Haitian, right?  Yeah.  The boy Files Gump, their brother, who's cooking his shrimp all night.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That big guy, who is that?  Yeah, yeah.  Bubba?  Wait, that is Haitian, right?  Bubba Gump?  Yeah, yeah.  It is.  It's some kind of mix of Caribbean and French.  Yeah, and they speak in the world.  And Haitians speak in Haiti, I think. 
[02:06:00]  Do they?  I think so.  Does anybody know?  I don't know.  Do you speak French, Jim?  Do you speak a little French?  No.  How about you?  He speaks Greek.  Yeah.  I took two years of French.  How do you say cut the grass in French?  Maudie lawn.  Maudie lawn.  I say we got it.  Holy shit.  We got it.  Ah, these fucking jokes I forgot about.  Hey.  Vinny, did you expect Jersey Shore to last as long as it has so far? 
[02:06:30]  No.  It's unbelievable.  No.  Absolutely not.  The new season, 9 million for the first fucking episode.  Yep.  Biggest premiere in MTV history.  Wow.  Damn, it was.  It's still damn good, man.  I mean, the first time we went, we just thought, like, I thought it was going to be like an hour  special.  You know when you watch those MTV things, like they come out with a new show every day?  Yeah.  And then it's five seasons later.  And it's only been two years.  That's the most amazing part.  Right.  Five seasons in two years.  Yeah.  That's why people say, oh, did you change?  Did you change?  I'm like, I don't have time to change. 
[02:07:00]  You know, like, all I'm doing is filming.  Yeah.  What season are they showing now?  Because I know four and five are both shot.  Are they showing four now?  Yeah.  And then five started.  Four just started.  Yeah.  Third episode?  Third episode tonight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And five starts, there's a break, and then five comes on.  Yep.  But it's already done.  Yeah.  It's already done.  It's amazing with these producers from MTV, with this fucking show.  And they pick eight different people, kids, like, from, you know, random, and they'll  look different from different, you know, areas, and put them together under the  same roof, and the shit that comes out of them, it's like magic. 
[02:07:30]  You know?  It's crazy, it's crazy, it's crazy, it's crazy, it's crazy, it's crazy, it's crazy.  He should write the fucking synopsis for it.  Yeah.  It's like fucking magic.  They're geniuses, they're geniuses, you know?  Do you like all the people that are in the house there, Nino?  Yeah, yeah, I like them.  I like some of them.  Oh, you're looking at Vinny.  Oh, yeah, who do you like?  I like everybody, right?  I like Mike.  Mike Sanitation's all right, you know?  Yeah, he loves his...  I mean, I can't picture Mike and dance with the stars, you know?  I met him in Florida.  I mean, he's got a great body, great hair, whatever you call him.  But, uh, he's pigeon-toed like a motherfucker, you know? 
[02:08:00]  He's gonna be at the dance with the stars, right?  I heard.  As I kept on the show a couple of times, and I just heard that Snook is gonna be at the  dance with the stars.  No, she's not.  She's not.  She's turned it down, yeah.  Yeah, how could she go?  With those fucking moon boots that she wears.  With the stars on the moon, she will make.  She'll have a shot, you know?  Moon, moon.  Snooki blows us off.  She doesn't want to do our show.  Yeah.  She's pretty much the only one.  She's the only one that won't do the show.  She's blowing everybody off.  What's up with Snooki there?  I don't know, man.  She blew us off.  We had a Sunday dinner plant. 
[02:08:30]  You know?  You don't miss Sunday dinner.  And, uh, she didn't come.  Well, was it family or the whole cast?  Or just...  Well, it was, uh, my family and two, like, two girls won a contest to win, uh, dinner with  my family.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  So this fucking guy was there, of course.  And, uh, she was supposed to come, but she didn't show up.  Did she call?  I gave it...  No, she didn't call.  She didn't call.  When did I turn it to...  Were they any good?  What?  Were they any good?  The girl?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It was this girl, right?  Shut the fuck up.  I've got to say that.  Oh, my God. 
[02:09:00]  You're old.  Let me tell you.  Let me tell you.  It was this girl, and, uh, she was a straight hillbilly.  Like, she ate frogs and squirrels and wrestled alligators.  She was from Florida.  They flew her in.  Oh, shit.  They flew her in.  And, uh, she never had Italian food, so it was cool.  She had a...  Was she pretty?  She's sweet as fuck.  She looked like an angel.  No makeup.  Yeah, she was pretty.  She wasn't bad.  She was pretty, yeah.  But she ate fucking rabbits, frog legs, squirrels, everybody.  She hunts deers with a bow and a gun.  Yeah.  21 years old. 
[02:09:30]  She was a fucking killer.  Wow.  Sounds like a catch right there.  Yeah.  It's like a little safety, look at her.  I had fucking same murder there.  You get any of, uh, Vinny's leftovers, Nino?  Yeah, a lot of leftovers, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I mean, I go to this fucking...  I got a friend of mine, Augie.  Augie.  Not Opie, Augie.  His name is Augie.  He called, he says,  How come he says,  Come, it's my daughter's birthday.  Yeah.  You know, because you come,  it's like, it's in this club in St. Allen.  I go there.  It's like from 12 to 4 in the afternoon.  There's about 40 little girls. 
[02:10:00]  The oldest one was 15 years old.  From 9 years old to his daughter.  Way too old for you.  11 years old.  And he goes,  I'm going here, we love you.  Would you bring Vinny?  We love Vinny.  We love Vinny.  So everywhere I go,  I'm going here, we love Vinny.  We love Vinny.  He's like, I'm like a stepping stone to Vinny, you know?  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, you're the connection.  Yeah, no, but I was in Long Island last week in a club.  I met this girl.  No names.  And, uh...  No names.  No names.  No names.  She gave me a number.  I gave her my number.  Shout her out.  And, uh, no, she called me two days later. 
[02:10:30]  I said, oh, Nino, I do, Uncle Nino.  I said, listen, uh, Regina.  I said, Regina, how old are you?  She said, I'm 24 years old.  I said, you know, I'm a few years older than you.  She goes, Uncle Nino, I don't care.  You're handsome.  I like you.  I like your character.  I said, you know what I mean?  That's the crazy thing.  When he goes on appearances,  the young girls.  I just like to make out with him.  Jim, I said, you know, me.  You're interested.  21 years old.  No, I'll be with you.  I'll spend time with you.  I said, okay, call me next week.  We'll get together.  He's 24 years old.  She's gorgeous.  You shouldn't have put her off 
[02:11:00]  until next week.  You should have fucking sent a car for her  and had her come immediately.  Send a car?  What the fuck?  Send a car?  He's like, yeah, send a car.  There's a motherfucker.  Send a car or a car?  A car?  A car.  A car.  Pick her up.  Are you not going to send her a car?  All right.  One time we were on appearance, right?  And he froze up big time with the girl.  Like, this woman, she was his age.  She spoke Italian.  And she's like, you know,  you are the man of my dreams.  Most amazing person.  And then he didn't say anything. 
[02:11:30]  He rolled the fucking window up.  He got scared.  And I'm like, me and Al looked at each other like,  what are you doing, bro?  You don't see what happened for the previous two hours before that.  Oh, God.  No, you know what?  She's your age.  You don't need that.  No.  What are you going to do with a fucking 50-year-old chick?  Yeah, you do that when the show's off the air.  That's when you date one-year-old days.  Yeah, now you got to fucking pick the 19-year-old.  So 21-year-old chicks like to make out with you at these appearances?  21, 24.  Nice.  He had a triple kiss on his last appearance.  Yeah, triple kiss. 
[02:12:00]  Three-way kiss.  Three-way kiss.  Yeah, fucking him grabbing a fucking ass.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Accidentally.  Accidentally.  It's crying.  It's fucking crowded.  No names.  It's crying.  It's fucking crowded.  No, fuck that.  Let me shop again.  Politically correct, bro.  Yeah, yeah.  No names.  No names.  No names.  Regina.  They didn't care that you grabbed their asses?  No.  Accidentally.  Accidentally. 
[02:12:30]  It was a new crowd.  You want me to leave here?  You don't want to do that.  It's got to be different after, like you do the first season, you just meet these people.  It's all new and everything.  Have certain things started coming out in people's personalities that you kind of like, oh, jeez.  All right.  Of course.  I didn't see that coming.  You're going to see in the last season some shit that you've never seen before.  Because it just has to happen.  I always say every time we go into a season, I'm like, what else can we do that no one has seen yet? 
[02:13:00]  And then something else just happens.  And that's the whole formula of reality TV.  It just puts you in this bubble until every little dark demon inside everyone's personality comes out.  How much of this day is planned?  I'm like, okay, say you guys go to Italy and they're like, we're going to go out to a club tonight.  I'm sure there's a coordinator that says you're going to go to this club.  No.  How does it work?  What happens is a month before we get out there, producers, they clear the whole city of Florence.  Like restaurants, they ask them, they sign contracts, they say, can we come in here and film? 
[02:13:30]  And then they put a big book on the table for us the first day we get there.  And then in that book, we make the show.  Oh, okay.  So we say, we're going here tonight, we're going to this club, and we give the producers a heads up.  And it's really just on the spot.  Oh, so then they give the place a heads up?  Yeah, without us knowing.  We just live the life.  They don't interact with us.  What's that expression?  On the sperm of the moment?  Is that what it's saying?  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, Vinny said something in there that you're going to see things that you've never seen before. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  A huge rumor, more true than a rumor, that you walked off.  Yeah, I did.  Season 5, you walked off.  Yeah, you're going to see it in full detail, what really happened.  But all I can say is, I mean, we went straight through from Italy to New Jersey, living in that environment.  And then everybody has a point that that's just not the right environment for them.  You know, like no one's going to love me more than myself and make the decision.  So I was like, you know, I need a little break. 
[02:14:30]  And that's what I did.  And, you know, sometimes like money.  Did someone piss you off?  No, no, no, no, no.  I just needed a break.  You know, sometimes money and all that shit just isn't important to me.  And I just need to recharge my batteries a little bit.  He just said, fuck you.  Went home to his favor for a couple of days.  That's all.  Fuck you.  Went home to his favor for a couple of days.  I would imagine Nito's like, will you get back in that house?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  I got laid over here.  I got fucking money.  I won't accidentally grab some more asses.  I don't want to be grabbing all the ass over here. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, that's not what I did.  But the media kind of spun it and said, like, he left.  He had a fight, blah, blah, blah.  But I just needed to break it.  Yeah, you're going to find out.  But I'm back.  I finished it.  We had Paulie D in.  And you guys are really close.  We asked him about Sammy and Ronnie and how annoying that shit is.  Yeah.  Well, me and Paulie, we kind of just stay out of it.  So now when we watch the show, I'm watching that drama for the first time with America  because while it's happening in the house, we're just interested in getting girls and 
[02:15:30]  partying, you know?  So when they fight, we just go the other way.  And then when Mike got into a fight with Ronnie, which you're going to see, like an actual  fight, we didn't even run in because we thought Ronnie and Sammy were fighting.  So we were like, ah, fuck it.  You know what I'm saying?  They knocked them out.  They knocked them out?  It's second nature to us, you know?  And then when we saw them fighting, we're like, oh, shit, we ran in the fucking room.  Ronnie knocks them out, right?  And you know that.  I see them.  They're two out of a stretch.  You'll see.  You'll see.  They're two out of a stretch, I think.  Fuck away.  Shut up.  I shut up. 
[02:16:00]  He wasn't there, but you'll see.  There's a little twist to that story.  That's what Paulie D said.  He said there's a twist there.  There's a little twist to that story.  You know, fucking.  Ronnie's fucked up.  Ronnie's fucked up in his head, you know?  Did you bang any chicks in England in front of Italy?  I had nine chicks in England.  In Italy, you'll see.  I mean, I did my thing.  It wasn't, honestly, it wasn't like it is in Jersey.  The Italian girls didn't, they weren't, you know, Jersey girls, they see cameras like  running in front of it and, you know, like, oh, get me on. 
[02:16:30]  You know, Italian girls weren't like that.  They didn't give a fuck.  They didn't give a fuck.  They didn't give a fuck.  And then all the American girls that were there, which was 99%, they were too young to  get in the house because you got to be 21, you know, for my safety.  Oh, shit.  Take them outside, Allison.  It was hard if you didn't in the backyard.  What's the drinking age in Italy?  21?  That's the thing.  There is none. 
[02:17:00]  What the fuck?  Those are in the club.  They're 17.  They're fucking drunk.  And I'm not bringing them back because who knows, you know?  Yeah, you don't need that.  It's just bad PR.  Even if it's not illegal there, it's still like, you know, I need Kenny to book me a  flight to Italy immediately.  Did they show the Jersey Shore over in Italy?  Yes, they did.  During the same season or a little behind?  It was a little behind, but now I think they're showing Italy out there.  The Italian girls didn't care about the cameras?  No, they didn't.  Are they shy or they just didn't give a fuck? 
[02:17:30]  No, they don't give a fuck.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't give a fuck.  I lived there.  I know.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't give a fuck and, you know, they still have fucking, like, strict parents  and shit.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  They're not up on top of bars, like, flashing their titties.  Up alone, y'all.  Let's go in the backyard and blinding, buddy, whatever.  What the fuck?  Holy shit.  Wait, what?  Do you like the chicks here better?  I would prefer dirtier girls.  I don't like shy girls.  I don't like fucking healthy parent situations.  No, you go there to find, like, a wife. 
[02:18:00]  No, I want a chick I could bring in the backyard and get blown.  Seaside, New Jersey.  I prefer that.  I prefer a clean-cut, nice girl.  I think they're freaky, but they're just more mature.  Like, these 19-year-old girls, they look like they're 30.  You know, the way they hold their cigarette, and they all have careers, and they're smart.  Like, they start young out there.  They're usually engaged by, like, 19 years old.  They speak English?  Some of them speak.  A lot of them speak English.  Do you speak Italian? 
[02:18:30]  I learned how to speak Italian in Italy.  I mean, I spoke a little bit from my family's foundation, but it was Sicilian, remember?  And then I took whatever I learned there and then mastered it in Italy.  So I can have a conversation in Italian.  Wow.  Like a minestrone.  Three languages.  English.  Thanks.  That's fucking good.  Minestrone.  I want Nino to talk about the cast a little bit. 
[02:19:00]  Throw some dirt around, brother.  Who don't you like?  I've seen an episode that Ronnie, Ronnie went, it was that thing, it was the third season?  Yeah.  Went to the doctor?  Yeah.  He went to the, it was something like he was partying too much.  He went to the proctologist.  He was, his plumbing was leaking or whatever.  Fucking.  And, you know, that reminds me of, you know, you got to stop drinking, you know, stop partying  so much.  He said, I agree with your system, you know? 
[02:19:30]  That reminded me of something.  I went to the proctologist once.  Had a little rash on my ass.  So, you know, so I walked in the room.  I bent over.  He put his finger on my ass.  He says, oh, Nino, there's nothing to worry about it.  You have a slight case of hemorrhoids, you know?  So I'm looking back.  He said, Doc, can you give me a second opinion?  He stoke two fingers on my ass.  What the fuck?  I forgot about his tagline.  What the fuck?  I went to another doctor. 
[02:20:00]  We cleaned it.  I went to another doctor.  So another proctologist.  So that man, no, he gets behind me.  I feel something going on my coulee.  So I'm looking.  He says, oh, I don't know.  I'm looking back.  He's got both his hands up in the air.  What the fuck?  I said.  What the fuck?  He said, oh, I don't know.  Oh, the same episode.  The same episode.  The same episode.  The girls went to the sex shop to buy like dildos, vibranos or whatever. 
[02:20:30]  So that's another thing I did one day.  I was in Jersey, South Jersey.  I went to the...  I bought a fucking blow-up doll.  I bought a blow-up doll.  A blow-up doll.  A blow-up doll.  It was nice.  I paid $150 for the fucking doll.  So I rented a room because I had a convertible.  I couldn't do it in the car.  So I rented a room.  I blew her up.  I blew her up.  I blew her up.  I blew her in the ass.  She fought in my face and fought the fucking window.  I said, what the fuck?  Quickest hundred times I threw out the window.  What the fuck? 
[02:21:00]  She fought in my face.  Wow.  You rent a room to get a blow-up doll, but a real girl, you'll get blown in the backyard.  Yeah, the back of the backyard.  You won't bring a real girl to the house.  She don't bite in the back of the yard.  No.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  I got to ask Vinny about Abercrombie and Fitch.  That's all over the fucking news.  That's fucking hilarious.  They're going with the situation where they said that they don't want any of you guys wearing  their clothes.  Yeah.  I never wore their clothes to begin with.  I never shopped there. 
[02:21:30]  Actually, they closed down in Staten Island.  They?  Yeah.  It was a bad publicity stunt, though.  I cannot believe that they used to sell GTL shirts.  Oh, really?  Did you guys know that?  No.  They used to sell...  There's pictures online.  And now they're saying they don't want to be associated with the Jersey Shore and shit.  And then last night, right before I went out, I couldn't resist.  I hate talking about things on Twitter now because it gives them so much press.  That's the point of what they did.  But I got a trending worldwide.  Last time, I wore Abercrombie. 
[02:22:00]  And then the whole world just started abusing them.  It was trending worldwide.  It was pretty cool.  Why do they want to dissociate with you guys?  They said that they were going to pay Situation to not wear the clothes.  Because on the last episode, he was wearing these fucking disgusting neon green Abercrombie  pants.  And they said that it gives them a bad name.  And they don't want to hurt the feelings of the fans and stupid shit like that.  What assholes?  They were going for a publicity stunt.  And then what happened?  I think the stock fucking dropped yesterday.  The stock plummeted. 
[02:22:30]  Sales dropped.  Someone got fucking fired yesterday.  Everyone was like, yo, they had shirts that used to say the Fituation and GTL.  And they're trying to say that they don't want to be associated with the Jersey Shore.  What?  Dicks.  Yeah, it just backfired.  You said the sanitation.  And there aren't those shirts?  Anyway, yeah.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Plan backfired big time.  Yeah.  Yeah, how annoying.  I hate when a company does that.  I mean, it worked because they were trending on Twitter all day yesterday.  And, you know, that's the first time I've heard Abercrombie. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, but the Jersey Shore is not seen as effeminate.  Like, when you think Abercrombie, you think fucking twink models.  You don't think just regular guys.  Like, I'm happy to be wearing Abercrombie jeans right now.  But, you know, it's just because I can wear a 32 and that's the only company I can still wear a 32.  But you think of fucking.  What the fuck?  Surfer dudes, right?  Yeah, you think like fucking, you know, kind of like German effeminate fucking twink men.  You're all trash.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just, you know, guys that are probably sexually abused by fucking other guys.  That's just what I think.  I don't think of fucking, you know, Italian dudes in Staten Island. 
[02:23:30]  I wonder if it's goodbye today with the stock dropping so much.  I don't know.  The whole fucking market's going to take a shit.  Is it?  Yeah.  All right.  Dina's coming in today, too.  I know, I know.  I can't.  She's my, she's, I'm closest with her.  Is this her first year?  She's skewers.  Second, second, second.  She's really cool.  She's not like caught up in any of this and shit.  She's like, you know.  Wait, she came in four or she came in three?  She came in three.  Oh, so you said three, four, five.  Okay.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Yeah, she's wild, too, man.  She gets drunk and she does.  She gets fucking wild.  She dropped her fucking panties the first night in Jersey. 
[02:24:00]  Nice.  By accident, she was like going to show.  Is it by accident?  It was by accident.  Yeah.  Did you see it?  No, by accident.  Mike did, nah.  Mike, no, I didn't see nothing.  She showed Mike.  She set a record.  Like, she came in the fucking house.  Fuck.  And her panties were down by accident.  She went to go pull her skirt down and everything came.  Did she want to show him?  No, she went to go show him, like, her thongs.  Yeah, she dealt the bush.  She dealt the bush.  What'd she have going on?  She'll tell you about it.  Yeah, she'll tell you about it.  Fuck yeah.  You like a shaved bush, Uncle Neil? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yo, you like a hairy one.  Are you old school?  You like the hairy ones?  I used to go to the dentist to get hair cut years ago.  I used to go to the dentist to get hair cut.  Right.  So think about that.  I used to think about that.  What the fuck?  Means he ate a lot of hairy pussy.  Okay, there you go.  Stuck in his teeth.  All right.  Give me those.  I'm a little slow today.  I never heard that.  I just put two and two together.  Let's figure it out.  Sure.  I didn't get that.  That's pretty good.  That's all right.  What's going on with JWoww, Vinny?  Oh, man.  What's up?  She lost a lot of weight and her face looks a little weird.  I saw your tweets. 
[02:25:00]  Sorry.  I don't know what you guys are talking about.  Yeah, she's got to be on some kind of fucking...  Nina will talk.  What's up?  What's up?  JWoww.  What?  She's going for a look.  I mean, supposedly her boyfriend whips her into shape.  I mean, he's a cool...  He's a really cool guy.  I love Roger.  And he's a gym buff.  So, she lost weight.  All right.  A little too much weight.  Yeah?  You think so?  I was with this girl. 
[02:25:30]  Oh.  Thank you.  Big fat girl.  He just saved you, Vinny.  How could you?  She's almost 150 pounds.  I found out the next day she lost her husband, a bitch.  What the fuck?  It's the only way that shit works.  It saves every one of those lines.  It saves that shit.  Are you guys ever laughing at the jokes?  I don't know.  Sometimes it's the whole presentation.  Jim, Jim, Henry.  What kind of a bird delivers white babies?  What's that big white bird? 
[02:26:00]  A stork.  A stork.  What kind of a bird delivers black babies?  A crow.  What kind of a bird delivers no babies?  A swallow.  What the fuck?  I'm done.  I'm done.  No, you're not done.  He goes, I'm done.  He goes, I'm done.  And I'm out.  Oh, what the fuck?  He's living on a high note.  I owned the butcher store in Brooklyn.  I think it was 1975.  1975.  And this lady used to come in.  She's like 40 years old. 
[02:26:30]  Cute.  Pretty nice.  Sexy lady.  She had a lot of kids.  She was very poor.  So one day I took her in the back room.  And they left her for like two hours.  I don't know how to give her a pound of suami, a pound of ham, a pound of bologna.  She goes, I buy some bread.  I told her, go fuck the baker.  What the fuck?  I buy some bread.  I go, fuck the baker.  What the fuck?  I like these jokes.  They're like from 1950.  Again, the butcher.  The baker.  It's the Italian Rodney Dangerfield. 
[02:27:00]  Uncle Nino, which one's out of all the girls in Jersey show would you like to take in the backyard?  I think I like to have a little menagerie.  Let's go three, oh three, oh four.  When you see Dina, ask her, tell her you have Skittles.  Oh, really?  Tell her you have Skittles.  Why?  Does she do a lot of E?  No, no, no.  Can I just say that and leave it and then you ask her?  Sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I danced with Dina.  Remember that.  I danced with Dina.  And then she called me a fucking pimp.  I don't know why. 
[02:27:30]  She said, in the third season.  Yeah.  Uncle Nino, it's an old pimp, she said.  It's a good thing.  It's an old pimp.  That's a good thing.  Maybe it was on my fucking stick.  I don't know.  It was a stick.  Did you get a heart on?  I got, uh, what's, no.  I could talk again.  What's worse than a heart attack?  What?  A soft attack.  What the fuck?  Why do you have the walking stick?  Are you injured or are you just like it?  No, I just like it.  I just like it.  It's an elf.  You know, I rub the, I, something, I got a good memory. 
[02:28:00]  You're fucking injured.  Yeah, my back is a little fucked up.  That's a big difference.  I got a good memory, but it's short.  Sometimes I forget things.  So I heard elephants have a good memory.  So I rub the, I rub the stick and think.  It's kind of like an ivory elephant there on top of his cane.  What was I talking about?  I just figured out what I was talking about.  I just figured out what the fuck I was talking about.  What happened to his back?  What happened to your back?  I'm not back.  I've been a stalemate.  So one of you guys, I was a stalemate for all my life.  Of course, since I was, so, you know, I love, I still try to do it today, but it's still 
[02:28:30]  hard for me, you know?  He's actually really good.  Stonework?  Really, really good.  One of the best on Staten Island.  One of the best in the fucking world on Staten Island.  What the fuck?  It's not saying much.  What do you do?  You build brick houses?  No, no, no.  I build brick houses, but my main thing is fireplaces, waterfalls.  I just did a waterfall two years ago for my doctor.  It's out of this fucking world.  Out of this world.  The one that puts two fingers up your ass? 
[02:29:00]  Not the doctor.  Not the hard doctor.  The other one that only put one finger up.  The hard doctor or the soft doctor?  Or the dentist that gave you a haircut?  A lot of doctor stories.  So wait, do you do them indoors or outdoors?  Indoors, outdoors.  How do you keep a waterfall clean?  Don't you have to clean it because it gets fucking buildup of something on it?  Waterfall.  Clean.  Don't you have to clean those things that have the water constantly following?  No, no.  The waterfall is usually in the pool. 
[02:29:30]  The water is filtered from the pool.  It gets filtered.  You turn it off and it filters through the water.  It runs through a filter.  It's like a pool.  So it's got chlorine.  It's not fucking nothing.  You can pee in the fuck.  All that.  Are you guys hanging around or not?  Why?  Who else?  Well, because Dean is coming in.  And I want you guys, you know, we haven't met her.  So it would be cool to do this all together.  I'm thinking.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You got a little more time?  Oh, yeah.  We're here.  We're chilling.  All right, cool.  So why don't we take a break and when we get back, because she's only a couple blocks 
[02:30:00]  away.  So Dina will join the fucking part.  Let's do it.  We'll have a little magic talk.  More Nino.  More of a little magic talk.  We'll have a little fucking orange.  You want to.  We're still on the air.  We're still on the air.  Yeah.  My goal is to have you talk shit about some people.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Look, he keeps looking at Vinny.  He wants to so bad, but he actually has some self-control.  And I liked last time where Vinny was just kind of going, hey, come on, Uncle Vinny.  I'm clinching.  I'm clinching.  I'm clinching.  Now he just turns around and goes, shut the fuck up. 
[02:30:30]  A lot's changed.  Yeah.  A few things have changed.  I've seen the dynamic change a little bit between you two.  All right.  We're going to continue with these guys.  They're killing today.  Are you still gambling?  The Jersey Shore Knicks.  I always gamble.  Don't wear condoms.  It's a gamble right there.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P.  Anthony Show.  Oh, look at it.  Listen to this.  Yeah, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, da, da, da.  What happened to the levels?  Very low.  Yes.  Turn up, Sam.  You stink.  Like the mains or something?  What are you doing?  This kid don't know shit.  Stereotypical.  Yeah, right?  I was with a girl.  She told me, fuck me in my ear.  I said, what?  She's not going to need to come.  Fuck that.  I'll be, uh, Sam's fucking everything up.  Yeah.  The levels were fucked up.  I think it's better now.  Oh, that.  The iPhone.  Oh, they went, ow.  That's pretty loud now.  Are we back? 
[02:31:30]  Yep.  Oh, fuck.  Me and Florentine were talking about kids in the hall for the last 15 minutes.  It's, uh, yeah, now it's too loud.  Oh, there you go.  But we were talking, uh, in the-  Yeah, turn that headphone level down and then turn your level up.  There we go.  Is that good?  Yeah, that's good.  That's about where it should be, I guess.  We were talking about, uh, Utah.  And they wanted to know when I'm going to be there.  And I said, this Friday, Saturday.  What?  What happened?  Wise Guys Comedy Club.  They're just asking, so I figured.  What a nice, uh, plug.  Yeah.  You're going to go to Utah and you know. 
[02:32:00]  I love that he just slips it in.  Utah.  What the fuck is that?  What the fuck is that?  Yeah, then somebody asked me when I'm going to be in Philly.  I'm going to be at Helium September 7th to the 10th.  Oh, yeah.  People just ask.  Yeah.  And then they said, when's that show starting to your host?  I'm like, that metal show?  That's this Saturday.  This Saturday, of course.  11 o'clock, Tony Iommi, VH1 Classic.  It's a whole night of rock that night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck the pot.  I don't care about the other show.  Oh, I don't care about that show. 
[02:32:30]  I'm talking about VH1.  Sam, you fucking idiot.  What are you doing?  What are you trying to do?  You know, he's.  Uncle Nino was asking about my podcast.  I'm like, can you just get it at jimflorentine.com?  It's on iTunes.  On iTunes, right?  I put it on the website this week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Florentine's involved in a lot of shit, man.  Hey, uh, that's good.  Yeah, yeah.  Shit.  Get out.  I would do something about that.  Gotta diversify like that.  Yeah.  Good observation.  I couldn't believe Uncle Nino was asking about my Twitter, too.  I'm like, he's out.  It's Mr. Jim Florentine.  Oh, mister.  How about that, folks?  Somebody had mine and whatever. 
[02:33:00]  Ezra from New York writes, Uncle Nino sounds like a drunk Robert Loggia.  Robert Loggia.  From Scarface?  I should kill him.  He hasn't gotten a hit all year.  Fucking Frank Lopez.  All right.  All Frank was better.  Couldn't fuck Elvira right.  How great was that?  Of course not.  Hello, madam.  How are you?  Yeah, the paparazzi follows us all the time now, Florentine.  Jeez.  The show's gotten that popular.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  Cameras.  They just follow you around, right? 
[02:33:30]  Vinny hates this world.  Vinny's like, what are you seeing cameras at this point, Vinny?  I do.  Well, when we film...  What kind of cameras?  Black and white?  Black and white?  When we film, it's in the house, it's cameras, and then now that we're famous, we film on the  street, and they open public, and then we have the paparazzi.  So, it's either paparazzi and the cameras, or just the cameras in the house.  There's never a break when we film.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're just...  No privacy, huh?  Nah, but it's a sacrifice.  Last time we left, he told me, he says to me, he says, those guys downstairs, paparazzi, 
[02:34:00]  don't, please don't talk to them.  Just keep walking.  Hey, you gotta...  You gotta breathe.  Handle it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He sees the paparazzi, he wants to have a conversation.  Ask me fucking about the food, but it was about the football season, but the Super Bowl,  I said, buddy, I don't know about fucking Super Bowl.  Leave me the fuck alone.  I don't talk to him.  Remember?  I don't talk to nobody.  He said, don't talk to nobody.  I'm gonna be like a fucking satan.  I love him.  And he walks around and just go like, Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened?  I was just...  I'm like just hoping that this is for a good reason later on. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, but he's just the kind of guy that's just like...  I don't like nobody.  I just want to relax a little bit.  A lot of people think I'm an asshole, like a lot of fans and shit.  And they're like, oh, situation's so nice, blah, blah, blah, and Vinny's a fucking asshole.  But I'm really just shy, and I'm real, you know what I mean?  It's not in me to go up to people like, hey, how you doing?  Right, right.  Just because it's the right thing to do.  I'm just like, I don't know how this happened to me, you know what I mean?  Yeah, you'd feel like the kind of guy that would probably want to just hang out somewhere quiet. 
[02:35:00]  When he talks, he says words that remind me of things, you know?  He's just that asshole.  So, when you realize you have an overbite, when you realize you have an overbite, when  you're in pussy, it starts tasting like shit.  When you have an overbite, what the fuck are you?  They're waiting for it.  I know.  That's how we know the joke's over.  It's crickets.  What people can't see, too, is the creepy reach for the wine. 
[02:35:30]  It's great.  The hands open.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The slow wine grab.  The guy grabs the wine, turns his head, takes the swing.  It's like it's Vegas in 1968.  Yeah, it's like a rat.  You give me a fuck, give me up.  You're like a rat.  Hey, give up.  75.  Vegas, like 75.  Who?  An Irish guy walks out of a bar.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's possible.  What the fuck? 
[02:36:00]  You didn't need it that time.  Little Irish guy stands out in the corner.  Little old man.  He's out in the corner.  He's got no pants on.  What?  Little Irish man.  Crazy.  He's got no pants on.  He's got a cock about this fucking long.  You're on the radio, bro.  Young guy comes over.  Oh, he says, sir.  He says, you're a leprechaun.  No names.  You're a leprechaun.  Shut the fuck up.  You're a leprechaun.  He says, maybe.  He says, I don't do anything.  What else have a cock that big?  Little old man says, 
[02:36:30]  you're the only way to raise your wish.  He says, I'm going to have to fuck you up the ears.  So the guy thinks about it.  He thinks about it.  He says, what the fuck?  What now, you know?  Pussy space that bends over.  The Irish guy gets the back of him.  Starts pumping away.  The Irish guy says,  Marais, how old are you?  He says, I'm 30 years old.  He says, you still believe in leprechauns, huh?  What the fuck?  I still believe in leprechauns.  You got to bring him over to the compound, Andy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's perfect for one of those parties. 
[02:37:00]  Why would he ask while he was still fucking?  Like, why wouldn't you say that after you came?  No, no.  It's exciting.  It's exciting.  Hey, how old are you?  What are you, sir?  I'm 30 years old.  Sam, what's going on with Roland?  What happened?  Out there.  There's a little thing going on with Roland.  What's going on?  Yeah, Roland's really been enjoying Uncle Nino's wine. 
[02:37:30]  Really?  Nice.  He'll be my best fucking customer.  Yeah, he will.  Roland, he'll be my best customer.  What the fuck?  I've never seen a smile like that.  Get on mic.  Get on mic.  Ronald.  Holy shit.  Delicious.  Take a picture of me and my buddy.  I'll go with Roland.  What the fuck?  Roland, whatever.  Raleigh's fingers.  Oh, what the fuck?  That's a good one.  What the fuck?  They did the old, you know, intertwined hands.  Sam, how much wine has Roland had?  How much?  Well, Roland, like, everybody got a taste in an old paper cup. 
[02:38:00]  Roland's had at least, like, three full cups of wine.  Oh, shit.  It's accidental.  But he's a bigger gentleman.  He's a big guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it takes some more.  You like the wine?  I love the wine.  It's delicious.  Yeah, all right.  Hey, I love management, too, today.  Yay.  What the fuck?  He's Italian all of a sudden.  Yeah, yeah.  What the hell happened, Roland?  I don't know.  I want pizza right now.  You should say what the fuck after that.  Sounds like a carnino. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  I don't think of shit.  What the fuck's going on?  He's hammered.  Hey, what was that?  What the fuck?  Speak up.  He hasn't had breakfast yet.  No, no.  This is breakfast.  I have an empty stomach.  It's got vitamins, minerals, everything.  Drink the fucking wine.  What the fuck?  It's great for you.  I'm going to eat eggs and bacon.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Wow. 
[02:39:00]  We don't need toast.  Fuck the toast.  Oh, bro.  Jim, Jim.  I remind you of a joke about toast.  Remember the last toast I made?  You told me you were going to write it down.  What was the toast I made?  Oh, you did.  You did say that, Jimmy.  It's a crack.  Right.  Ah, right?  You have a bad memory.  Yeah.  It's a good memory.  I don't have to.  Let him rub the cane.  Let him rub the elephant.  Yeah, rub the elephant.  Just make a toast to the crack that never heals.  You listen to me? 
[02:39:30]  You listen to me?  Yeah.  He's trying to cover his ass.  Crack that never heals.  The more you rub it, the better it feels.  You can scrub it from in hell.  You never get rid of that fishy smell.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Roland's in.  Roland's laughing.  Roland's in.  Holy shit.  Uncle Nino, you ever have one that smells down there?  That's right.  Smell it.  Yeah.  If it smells like fish, you like a dish.  Yeah.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Let him pay attention, Anthony.  Smells like fish.  You like a dish. 
[02:40:00]  If it smells like cologne, leave it alone.  Ah, yeah.  They're trying to cover up something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I was just passing.  I was paying attention.  I was passing the bottle of wine to Ruralo.  Ruralo.  Ruralo.  Yeah.  Ruralo.  Rurali.  Our health care insurance is so-so, so I'm taking care of my health.  What the fuck?  You're going to walk down there for a race.  You're all red.  Everyone's young, Sandy.  What the fuck?  Look at him.  Roland's got a state.  Roland's got red.  His tongue is red.  He's been eating blueberry pie. 
[02:40:30]  What the fuck?  Best customer.  Is your best customer?  You know.  I'm welcome.  Oh, you drink from nothing.  Where's Dina?  Where's Dina?  She's stuck in traffic 15 minutes out.  What the fuck?  My boy finally came in.  I was talking fucking traffic.  What the fuck?  What the fuck, huh?  I tell you, Roland, you look like you're having a good time.  I'm happy today at work.  Ruin my party.  Yeah.  That's great.  Are you a little tipsy?  Roland, the drinks are on the house. 
[02:41:00]  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.  I just forgot what the fuck I was going to say.  Rub the up.  Rub the up.  Rub the up.  Rub the up.  Oh, you just came back.  You just came back.  You just came back.  You just came back.  Oh, this past birthday, I have a twin brother, you know?  Yeah.  I have a twin brother.  Motherfucker, forgets my birthday.  So this past birthday, I was very depressed.  I forgot my birthday again.  So I'm in the middle of the night.  I'm watching television.  They have those commercials.  If you're lonely, depressed, call together.  The ladies are called together. 
[02:41:30]  So I called together.  That put me on for four fucking hours.  That got me more depressed.  Let me kill myself.  I jumped out of the window.  I was in a fucking basement.  I couldn't get that right.  My fucking head on the ground.  My feet were still in the house.  What the fuck?  Look, Roland loves it.  You got an audience.  Look at Roland.  Roland.  I can't get drunk without girls around me.  Yeah.  It really is creepy. 
[02:42:00]  Isn't it just fucking 12 men drinking?  Yeah.  I can't do it.  I'm just never that dude.  I'm just never that dude.  You're ugly with the camera.  The camera's got a lot of bitches in there.  We'll cook.  Never just drink with the guys though.  Go out and fucking...  When I get drunk, I get horny.  Well, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, I need some girls around.  Roland gets hungry.  Pizza party?  It'll be a pizza party in my office today.  Yeah!  Oh, you think so? 
[02:42:30]  Oh, you bitch of a sweet ass.  I need five pizzas right now.  Is there the pizzeria opens?  Call me ASAP.  You are one.  Okay.  You're a sap.  Yeah, right?  Roland has restaurants that call him if they haven't heard from him.  What the fuck?  You're going to have to board up the...  He is...  Yeah, he really is.  What do you got?  His eyes are all glassy.  His teeth are red from the wine.  And as cool as it is in here, he's sweating. 
[02:43:00]  Why are you sweating?  Why am I fucking sweating?  Why am I fucking sweating?  What's in your eyes?  Yeah, jalapeno.  He's got a fucking dog.  They'll see you in the cat.  He'll both walk.  What the fuck?  Hey, Sam, have you tried wine?  No, I haven't tried it.  You've never tried it in your life?  No, no, yeah.  I've tried wine before.  You want to have a sip of jalapeno's wine?  Put a straw in there.  Just have a sip. 
[02:43:30]  Put a straw in there.  A crazy straw.  The only got a little bit left.  I need to save it for Dina.  There's bottles.  There's a lot of bottles.  There's another bottle around here somewhere.  There's a whole bottle around here somewhere.  What the fuck?  Is there?  Yeah.  Have a little bit.  Might as well, right?  There's two bottles.  Go ahead with your beer for it.  Have a sip.  Have a sip.  Take a sip anyway.  I'm not going to drink after rolling.  That's germs.  Oh, oh, oh.  No, no, no.  He's got no water.  Wow, he's down on that.  Oh, back in Brooklyn, 1975.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  1975. 
[02:44:00]  It's better to be short.  We're listening.  We're listening.  We're focused.  1975.  I'm coming up.  Is it short?  Short.  Throw me the cups, C-Rock.  Hurry up.  Go.  Hurry up.  Sorry, every time you're telling me,  it'll take me fucking long.  I was going to say it.  I was just fucking.  See you fucking.  I was in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  I was almost 4 o'clock in the morning.  I was a little horny.  So I ran to this girl.  I said, miss.  I bought a blowjob.  She says, $10.  I said, all right.  I said, for an extra $5,  I give a wax job with her. 
[02:44:30]  A wax job.  I said, wax job?  What's a wax job?  She said, oh, you like it.  I said, all right.  $15.  What the fuck?  So she's blowing me as I'm coming.  She bites my cock so hard.  The wax popped out of my ears.  I said, what do you go?  She's beautiful.  Never again.  Never fucking again.  Never again.  I went a week later.  A week later.  I was in the same neighborhood.  Back as a week later.  I was in the same neighborhood.  I was fucking.  I went into this girl.  She says, I said, I'm going to get laid.  She says, $10.  I said, all right.  So she takes me under the fucking broad work. 
[02:45:00]  In the sand.  I'm laying on my back.  She sits on top of me.  She says, pumping away.  As I'm finished coming, she farts right on my lap.  She says, $10.  Get the fuck out of here, you pig.  She goes, no, $15.  I said, what?  You told me $10.  No.  I said, $10 to get laid.  $5 to blow the sand off your balls.  Shut the fuck.  I give her $15.  Where's Roland?  Where's his audience?  Nothing, no.  I don't know if he has to tell us.  So he gave me $15.  No, nothing, nothing, no. 
[02:45:30]  Same, same, same neighborhood.  Sure.  Of course.  It was like three weeks in a row.  Three weeks in a row.  Three weeks in a row.  I'm in the same neighborhood.  So I fucked this girl.  She gives me fucking crabs.  I gave my wife crabs.  That was fucking a disaster.  So I read it to her about a week later.  I said, you fucking dirty pig.  You gave me crabs.  So she says, what about for dollars?  Lobsters?  What the fuck?  What about for dollars?  Lobsters?  Lobsters?  What do you expect from the next season?  Nightmare.  Fuck. 
[02:46:00]  All right, take a break, take a break, take a break.  I'm still having nightmares.  Last time I was here, in that fucking bathroom.  What happened?  I had to pull myself up with the fucking...  The bathroom was so fucking long.  Oh, yeah, like a nice high boy toilet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like a throne.  Where's Roland?  Yeah, where's Roland, man?  He really pumps up your material.  Roland is just fucking...  Roland, you're missing some good jokes.  You and Nino.  Dina's like 10 to 15 minutes out.  Holy shit, where is she?  Second traffic.  Where, though?  She's coming from New Jersey.  She's coming from far deep, New Jersey. 
[02:46:30]  Really?  Yep, yep.  Just to do our drag.  No, she's doing like the whole...  The tour?  The tour, yeah.  Oh, yeah, going around.  I don't do the tour.  No, huh?  Loyal to you guys.  Ah, I see.  What, she's doing everybody?  Fucking pretty cool.  What, she doing?  She doing everybody?  Yeah, she's doing everybody.  She's doing everybody.  What the fuck?  Yeah, she's doing everybody.  Al Camino, you wear condoms?  Condoms?  What the fuck is that?  What the fuck?  Condoms.  What if a girl says, 
[02:47:00]  I want you to wear one before you fuck me?  What I do is I sneak out,  I take it out,  I bite a little,  I bite it,  when I put on it,  boom, it slips right out.  A nice old school track.  Get on, fucking big boom.  He bites.  Roland's loving that one.  Oh, get on mic, man.  Oh, shit, Mike.  I've never seen Roland so happy. 
[02:47:30]  Me neither.  Yeah, Roland...  She's a good day.  Yeah, you are stress-free Roland.  Stress-free Roland.  It's like a drug-free.  It's like,  I'm drug-free.  I stopped doing drugs.  It was the worst 20 minutes of my life.  I'm drug-free now.  I get it for nothing.  What the fuck?  What was the doctor joke?  Oh, boy.  Shut up.  What was the doctor joke? 
[02:48:00]  It's five minutes, bro.  Just shut up for one minute.  What was the doctor joke?  What was that doctor joke?  The one that I said the last time.  Two doctors or something?  No, the doctor told me I got to stop having sex,  stop doing drugs,  stop drinking.  What did I do?  I switched fucking doctors.  Yeah, that's what you do.  Of course.  He just took his mic.  He just took his mic.  I got one more, one more.  What are you doing?  You're just off from all this shit.  Is there any way you can get away from it  and just hang out and be a normal human being? 
[02:48:30]  I mean, we travel so much.  I do appearances, too.  I call that my waiter job  because I do have other things I want to do in life  and that's how I make money.  And then my vacation is like home, you know?  When you travel so much,  your vacation becomes your house.  Just hanging out at home, right?  But what do you like doing at home?  I just like plopping down my ass in front of the television.  I can't do that, though,  because then I fall into these ruts,  you know what I mean?  I have dogs, 
[02:49:00]  I fucking exercise,  play basketball,  go bike riding,  and shit like that.  Yeah.  Is it harder, though,  to go out without just being...  Staten Island is not that hard  because everyone's like really stuck up over there.  Yeah.  So I go to the gym  and it's fine and shit, so...  Yeah, look at that fucking guy over there.  Yeah, but it's still...  Yeah, everywhere I go.  Dixie's fucking cool, dude.  Exactly.  He sounded like...  Hey, look.  You got a fan out there.  Oh, got a girl in here?  You got to bring her in.  She's losing her mind.  Is it for me?  It's not for me.  No, come on in here for a second.  Come here.  She's losing her mind.  You know that I still text that chick once in a while. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  She's from the one that was in here last time.  Hi.  Oh, what a big shot.  Are you shot?  Are you shot?  Are you done?  Yeah, it's her.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, it is her.  What's up?  Hi.  That's from last time.  You could bypass me.  I'm just like, bypass me.  Hi, how are you?  How are you?  How are you doing?  I'm good.  How are you?  Good, good, good.  You guys...  Do you think...  Do you think he looks very handsome today?  Yes, he does.  Oh, thank you.  I like your new hairstyles and facial hair.  Okay, I don't exist here.  No, she's looking right through you now. 
[02:50:00]  Sorry.  Hi, Uncle.  Ksenia, right?  Kenya.  Oh, Kenya, Kenya, so...  Close, close.  Away from Kenya?  That's pretty good.  No, I'm not.  I'm Dominican.  Dominican.  It's...  Wait, what the hell are you doing?  I'm working part-time here.  Oh, okay, cool, cool.  We haven't seen her since, Vini, by the way.  By the way, Vini, we haven't seen her since, and she works here.  I was just going to say...  Oh, name.  I know.  This is the second time I've seen this girl, and it's when you were here.  That's so funny.  I was just passing by.  I was saying hi to my friends.  Oh, yeah.  Just passing by.  You haven't passed by in a year. 
[02:50:30]  We've never seen you pass by yet.  Because I work on the 19th floor, so I was saying hi to my mash-up friends.  Rich, Ryan, and Nicole.  Just happened to walk by.  I used to intern for them, so I wanted to say hi.  And it was just a coincidence that...  It was.  I swear.  I swear to God.  Again, again.  I love you.  I swear.  You tease your animal?  You tease your animal?  You tease your...  Yeah, put a little bit of moose in it.  That's it.  And then for a memory, he goes, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Oh, Jesus.  No, he did not.  He's teasing us something.  That was good.  Chip loves that one. 
[02:51:00]  That's a good one.  He's my heir of fun.  No Dominican jokes.  No, no, no.  You've got to keep him.  This is the new Vinny.  He's very worried.  Every time he talks, do you worry about your whole career just going down the toilet?  Every time.  It's a very fine line that I walk every day.  Oh, yeah.  Do you think Uncle Nino's handsome?  Yeah, he is.  Kenya smells really good.  Yeah, you're not just stopping in.  Thank you.  You got all gussied up for this.  Nobody say hi to me.  Oh, hi.  You want to hug him?  Oh, you can hug him.  Yeah.  Vinny's not moving. 
[02:51:30]  Vinny's not even getting out of the way.  I'm going to grab her ass.  It's crowded in here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I just saw an accident.  I think Nino had an accident.  Don't worry.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, help her, I see there.  It's crowded in here.  Wow, she does have a nice dance on.  See, now I'll have a drink.  Kenya, Kenya, Kenya.  Kenya, Kenya.  Yes, Kenya.  Give me a drink, Vinny.  Yeah.  She's very pretty.  I'm bringing her to dinner Sunday. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, this is her last time.  I did?  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he just told me to shut the fuck up.  No, no, no.  I'm kidding.  Would you go to dinner with Vinny if he invited you?  I would, yeah.  Do you have a boyfriend?  I don't.  How about if he won't, but I still work here, would you go with me?  How about, yeah, I would love to make love to your belly button.  From the inside, eh?  All right, now that's a funny fucking joke.  From the inside. 
[02:52:30]  You didn't need a what the fuck there, huh?  No, no, no.  That's a good one.  She's pretty.  That's a good one.  You look really good.  Yeah, beautiful.  The months have done you well.  You look tan.  Did you go somewhere?  Thank you.  Um, I haven't.  I'm actually going to Miami today.  Did he just say Dominica?  Dominica.  He goes, you look tan, wear your paint.  He goes, Dominica.  She's Dominican.  She's from Dominican.  Yeah, I went to Dominican.  Fuck it.  No. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, shit.  You're a crocodile.  You're a real dog.  Thank you.  Where's Roland?  He's missing some beauties.  I was laying in bed today.  Anthony, what are you doing?  Writing a fucking book over there?  No, I eliminate people from a certain chat room.  I was laying in bed.  Listen to me.  I was laying in bed last week with a girl.  Yeah.  So I turn around.  I look at her face.  She got one tooth in her fucking mouth.  I said, oh, bitch.  Can I have a bed?  Go brush your tooth.  She's walking to the bathroom. 
[02:53:30]  I said, honey, lift your stockings up.  The red gold.  She says, I'm not wearing any.  That's a fucking...  That's a fucking...  That's a fucking...  That's a fucking...  Look at Roland.  I just cheered him.  Wait, the guy would raise his glasses.  What do you got?  We have to stay with us.  I don't know.  I could...  Yeah, where do you guys go?  Just hang out.  Yeah, why don't you take a seat over there?  See you right next to me.  Yeah, take a seat next to...  I have to go to work soon.  Don't work?  What the fuck is that?  I do?  We're big shots around here.  We can tell everybody you don't have to work. 
[02:54:00]  We can meet a working.  Wait, where do you work again?  I work here.  Yeah, I'm working with the music programming department.  Speak on the microphone.  Speak on the microphone.  Yeah, I work for the...  Not that microphone for you listeners at home.  I work for the music programming department, but I'm on the 19th floor.  I hope she doesn't forget anything, because Nina's going to make her rub the elephant, and it's going to be that cane.  The cane won't be anywhere near her.  Nina, I've got to blow up her spot. 
[02:54:30]  She works on the 19th floor, which means she's not just stopping by, because you have to take a whole other elevator bank to get where she works.  All of that's right.  I have to blow up your spot.  This is no fucking...  It is.  I didn't even know who's going to be here today.  Give me two nipples with that.  She has to go to the lobby to go to another elevator bank to get to work.  Like I said, I came to say hi to my friends, and I was going to go visit my boss.  How come you only do visiting in this area when he's in the building? 
[02:55:00]  I don't know.  It just happened to be a big coincidence, but I swear I didn't even know he was going to be here today.  Really?  I'm so serious.  Why don't you guys get together, Vinny?  What's up?  We leave here, and then I go on Staten Island.  What are you, from the Bronx or something?  I live in Manhattan, uptown Manhattan.  Yeah, she goes uptown.  And he's Harlem?  Yes.  Kate, Kate.  I don't like dating.  I think dating's weird.  I don't know.  Kate, what do you do?  He just likes fucking.  Just kidding.  Yeah, that's funny.  Dating's weird.  You're sitting at the table, and then you've got to make conversation and shit. 
[02:55:30]  I don't like that.  Hey, this girl, Kate, does the collar match the cuffs?  Don't answer that, Kenya.  She says no cuffs.  What the fuck?  No cuffs.  Kenya, don't answer that.  She's a nice girl from Dominica, bro.  Dominica.  You don't want a relationship?  You just like to kind of hang out, bang, and that's it.  No, no, no, no.  It's not like that.  I just don't like the dating part.  Like the actual making of the conversation.  That's what I said.  You want some back, Lily? 
[02:56:00]  I like when it just happens.  I don't know.  Yeah.  That back's it.  So like if me and her, like if we arrange to go out, and then like we get there, we sit  there, oh, this place is nice.  It's like awkward.  Yeah.  I hate that.  You remember season two when you talked to Ronnie?  So before, but before, but before you were on the show, how would you make that happen?  It's a lot more difficult.  I love it.  Before I was on the show, I really didn't get that.  I love it.  To go right through.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, because it's hard to go from zero to 60 without having a show.  Exactly. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, no, no.  So you'd rather meet her in a club, have a few drinks, and see what happens afterwards.  Exactly, yep.  No dinners.  Roland agrees with that, too.  At the end of the morning, get the fuck out of here.  I love the color in your toenails and your...  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  What's that?  What's that?  A turquoise or blue jade?  Yes.  That comes from...  Did you just mention vodka?  No, it doesn't.  Yeah, you really did name every color but green. 
[02:57:00]  What is that?  Turquoise, blue, black, orange.  And then she said...  I love it, Jim.  Adam from Great Neck writes,  It's for the first time in history, Kenya is not dry.  Oh, that's pretty good.  Sorry, Kenya.  That's pretty good.  Oh, shit.  A little geography joke.  I like it.  Yeah, I like it.  Get the...  Oh, fuck it.  Is your belly button pierced?  What are you?  It's not, no.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, Texas.  I was just wondering. 
[02:57:30]  Hey, Kenya.  I could pierce it now.  From the inside.  Kenya, talk to Vinny.  You're obviously a big fan of him in the show.  You got any questions?  Yeah, ask him a question.  You always wanted to ask him a question.  You're both going to do this again.  I'm getting me all fucking horrid.  Let's do this date thing right now.  How is it?  Yeah, get this date shit over with.  Hey, how was it?  How is it?  Vinny will...  How was Italy?  See?  It's fucking...  Yeah, yeah, see?  Italy was nice.  That's a high question.  Is the situation really that ab-fantastic? 
[02:58:00]  Oh, get the fuck out of here.  Roll up.  Roll up.  Roll up.  Roll up.  Roll up.  Roll up.  Roll up.  Roll up.  Roll up.  Roll up.  Roll up.  Roll up.  Roll up.  Roll up.  Let's get her some wine.  Roll up.  Wait, let's go to Roll up.  Anything else, Roll up?  Does DJ Polly use a lot of gel products?  How is it on TV?  Do you meet a lot of celebrities?  What are they like?  Do you know Lady Gaga?  I love Lady Gaga.  Exactly. 
[02:58:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  He's gone.  Do you have fancy restaurants and stuff with forks?  Yes.  Roll up.  Another sip.  Another big sip.  He took me.  Oh, that's a big sip.  He had to wet his whistle after all that talking.  He's doing pretty good after all that slurring.  I feel like I'm at the compound.  Roll up.  Roll up.  You want to go over the cast of The Jersey Shore?  I'll mention his name.  No, you don't have to go.  How about Ronnie? 
[02:59:00]  What do you got on Ronnie?  Oh, wait.  Wait.  You got a sip first.  He's that guy called Nino.  Two doctors walk in.  I don't remember Ronnie.  Two doctors walk in.  He had to fuck out of here.  Two bars walking with you.  Wait.  I just noticed that.  I got two doctors walking in.  Roll it.  I was on a blind date.  I was on a blind date.  I was on a blind date.  The bitch showed up with a fucking dog.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[02:59:30]  So what'd you do?  I don't fuck the dog.  I got an answer for you.  I was going to say that.  God damn.  I did a favor.  Oh, what are you doing?  Look, I told you.  I did a favor.  Oprah?  I did a favor.  I did my friend a favor.  Yeah.  Anthony, I did my friend a favor.  Yeah.  Yeah, I did a favor.  It was nothing.  It was nothing.  It was nothing.  Let me give you some money.  Thanks a lot.  I said, boy, it's okay. 
[03:00:00]  I said, please, let me give you some money.  Buddy, you're my friend.  Don't worry about it.  He goes, let me do something.  Let me take you out to dinner.  It's all right.  You take your wife.  I'll take some other pig.  You know?  What the fuck?  I love how he has to get attention before he tells his joke.  He looks around the room.  He's like, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Point out who's going to tell the joke.  Roll the joke.  I think we're fucking stuck in here.  Roll, yeah.  We're stuck together.  We're stuck together.  We're stuck together.  Hey, Roll, you got another joke?  Because the two doctors one was terrific. 
[03:00:30]  We're stuck together.  We're stuck together.  We're stuck together.  Roll's got one.  He's got it.  I said, we're at a restaurant.  What are we doing here?  Get the fuck out of here.  Opie, listen to me, baby.  Listen to me.  Pinkberry?  Is it really yogurt?  Or some jizz?  Get the fuck out of here.  Sam, Sam.  This is why he's going to take off like a motherfucker.  Sam, Sam.  This is why those wonders.  Those fucking wonders.  It's a magical juice.  Magical.  This is. 
[03:01:00]  You're going to have to deal with this.  Sam, what are you doing?  Why are you texting over?  Oh, no.  Why are you calling the list?  I'm listening on the drive home.  This is Opie Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's the?  This is the juice of life.  Right, rolling.  Ah, the juice of life.  This is life.  Yes.  It's life.  And Jim says, it's life, juice.

Rolling, rolling.  Back in Sicily.  Anthony, get out of here.  I just wanted to tell Roland, it's all fun and games and stuff, but what happens now when  the show is over and you're still like this and now you've got to work around.  Well, Kenya.  That's why you go home sick.  Get the fuck out of here.  I got to shit or something. 
[03:02:00]  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Kenya works in the same building.  She'll help him out.  Whatever she's got to do.  Yeah?  She'll help him out?  But she's on another floor.  Stick her rolling and I'll pierce your belly button.  On the inside.  Right, right, right.  Look at that.  Come on.  You're alone, bro.  That's my girl.  Hey.  Yeah, man.  You're moving in on Vinny's girl.  How many times have you been in 50?  50, 50.  Has he ever cock-blocked you?  All the time.  He does?  He is right now.  What are you just barging?  You can't even sit next to each other.  In a way, it's cock-blocking, but in a way, I like having situations kind of like that. 
[03:02:30]  Is that cock-blocking or cock-blocking?  When you have a really crazy guy around.  What did you say?  What was the question?  Yo.  Shut the fuck up.  You have a balloon thing.  I didn't do it.  That's your blueberry.  What the fuck?  You get a crazy guy like that.  Get the fuck out of here.  I give up.  Wait, the girls are more likely to fucking talk to you because he's so crazy.  Yeah, they run away.  They need safety, you know what I mean?  Because they're scared of him.  Ah, shit.  That's why I come in.  So that kind of works.  Look at those two mafioses out there.  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, shit. 
[03:03:00]  He's off the hook.  He's off the fucking hook.  Actually, they keep going on the channel, so it's okay.  They're talking about gardening.  Get the fuck out of here.  Change the channel.  Roland's like Fredo's wife at the wedding.  Never book a walk.  You want me to take care of this?  That the fuck.  That the fuck. 
[03:03:30]  I love it though, Roland.  Can you have a real...  I'll break the ice.  I'll break the ice.  I'll break the ice.  Oh, this couple.  This couple.  They go to the movies.  Watch the movie.  Oh, sure.  So, they watch the movie.  A few minutes go by.  The wife says to the husband, Annie, this guy next to me is bothering me.  The husband says, ignore him.  Five minutes go by.  She goes, Annie, it's really bothering me.  The husband says, what is he doing?  She says, he's masturbating.  The wife says, don't look.  Do you ignore him?  The wife says, I can't. 
[03:04:00]  The husband says, why not?  She says, he's using my hand.  The wife is very smart.  She comes up with good ideas every day.  Marriage is exciting.  She's in the kitchen one day naked.  She wraps herself in Shreve Wrap.  And she plays on the kitchen table.  That's because of work.  Open the door and says, motherfucker.  Leftovers again.  Get the fuck out of here.  You know, you've got to give him the quantity. 
[03:04:30]  Quantity of jokes.  Roland, what do you got on Snooki?  Let's ask Roland about Snooki.  Oh, Roland.  Roland, what about Snooki?  What about Snooki?  She looks a little orange and like an Oompa Loompa.  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, boy.  More wine.  More wine.  Because he got a dick in the ass.  Get the fuck out of here.  And why won't you come on the show, Roland?  Yeah, Roland.  Are they saying it in Italian?  She's like, cuntaroo. 
[03:05:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  Yo, is this how that happened before?  No.  That's why we're going with it.  No.  Roland.  Snooki is just like a little chill.  I don't know what diet like that is.  A little chill.  I'm going to have two large pieces of the shit, Snooki.  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to name it to flush it.  What diet like this, cuntaroo?  They say that at the Vatican.  After they touch the kids. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, jeez shit.  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, oh, oh.  There's two priests.  Two priests.  They got to go on a mission.  They got to go on a mission.  They got to go on a stage.  They got to fly on a stage.  So they take a little altar boy with them.  They take a little altar boy with them.  So they're on the plane.  And something goes wrong with the plane.  The fucking pilot gets ejected out of the plane.  There's only two parachutes in the plane. 
[03:06:00]  So the priest puts it on.  The other priest puts it on.  One priest says, the other priest says,  What are you going to do with the altar boy?  The other priest says, fuck him.  The other priest says, you think I have enough time?  Get the fuck out of here.  He was going to jump or something.  That's right, Chip.  Oh, wait.  Listen.  I heard Anthony open.  I've been listening to him.  Do we have to pay attention?  Jim, who's this fucking guy?  Who's this guy, Chip?  Chip.  Who's this guy, Chip?  Chip.  There's a guy, Chip.  Who's the fuck is he? 
[03:06:30]  Who is he?  He's a guy that comes in.  He bombs him.  Gynecologist, what?  No, he's a gynecologist.  He's just a guy who wants to be.  He's a gynecologist.  He's a guy that comes in.  I'm like a friend of mine.  A friend of mine is Johnny from Brooklyn.  He's like, he was born a little deaf, you know?  I ran into him a couple of weeks ago in Brooklyn.  He's all excited.  He runs up and says, I'm so excited.  I was relaxed.  I always run.  He said, I bought an earring here.  That's perfect.  I bought the best one I make.  It cost me $450.  I said, how much you pay for it? 
[03:07:00]  He said, it's $4.30.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  You don't have any gynecologist jokes?  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm just confused right now.  Go, Roland.  Go.  I love you.  I'm here.  Oh, how come Polish girls don't like dildos?  Because their teeth fall out.  What the fuck?  Oh, what?  I'm just confused right now.  Roland, you got anything?  You good?  Roland, you all right? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  You got to check on Dina.  Oh, you got to go check on a booking.  Yeah, and I have to check on my pizza order, too.  I've never seen him like that.  What happened?  What?  He's sweating like a maniac.  It's a maniac.  She's making it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Traffic in the tunnels.  Fuck, we want to meet Dina today.  I know.  She's fucking awesome.  Well, it would be a seven-minute interview, because I sure as fuck ain't hanging out.  I got to get back to Long Island, get my fucking pool, huh? 
[03:08:00]  I was in a swim pool, I was in a swim pool.  Young girl says, I call Nino, is it true if you take your freak around, I'll drown?  That's fucking good.  Is it a pussy or something?  He really does have a joke for all the kids.  She's close, bye.  She's close.  What?  Well, so is the fucking minute hand from 12.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[03:08:30]  Exactly what I'm doing.  He's fucking lying.  Oh, oh.  Ron, Ron.  I'm here.  Roll it, roll it.  I still see you.  How does Pinocchio make love to his wife?  How does Pinocchio make love to his wife?  How does he fuck his wife?  How do I finish?  She sits on his face.  Lying, motherfucker.  Keep lying, motherfucker.  She sits on his face.  Get the fuck out of here.  You get the opening.  You get it.  Oh, I got it.  Oh, I got it.  That's not the problem.  I got it.  You got it?  Oh, we got it.  Does the doctor know what it is yet? 
[03:09:00]  They're not all going to be winners, sir.  Shut up.  How many cups of wine have you had so far, Roland?  Just grape juice.  Oh, grape juice.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Five minutes?  Five minutes.  It's fine.  What happens now if you try to bang me to one of the bosses?  Are you really?  Get the fuck out of here.  You should take her out on a date side of that.  You should start by getting an easy pass, though.  She's not going to want to sit at 45 minutes of the time.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  It's like a Knick game or something.  That's fine. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can get tickets to a Knick game.  Ken, what would you do?  What would you do with Vinny?  What would I do with Vinny?  What would your ideal day be with Vinny?  Yeah.  Stop.  What are you talking about?  A Knick's game sounds fun.  But after that.  Yeah.  Like, what goes down?  Get the whole night.  Course night seats.  A five-star restaurant.  A limousine.  Diamond earrings.  Gucci.  Versace.  All the cheese. 
[03:10:00]  A destiny.  A thousand dollars, because I don't want to walk home.  I'm scared.  Other than that, I'm just a normal girl in New York.  I just want love.  Bullshit.  Oh, my God.  Anthony, you create a fucking monster.  You create a monster.  Oh, shit.  That's not my whining.  What the fuck is that whining?  I just found the guy who makes me laugh, and then I walk in, they're like, money's 200  pounds.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[03:10:30]  A lot of shit's coming out today, man.  Oh, yeah.  Kenya?  Basically, when you bang Vinny, I guess is what we're going to do.  So, the neck game, then what happens after the neck game?  Not the first night, right?  No, not at all.  Not the first night.  Not at all ever?  Not the first night.  Not the first night.  Oh, man.  Do you guys make out?  Yeah, definitely.  Maybe a kiss or two.  Oh, I forget.  Vinny's moving on.  No, no, no, no, no.  I like a challenge.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Good, good.  Challenge.  I don't believe it when they say it, when a girl says, I'm not, I won't do it, I'm not. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, really?  That's what they say to us.  The first thing they say, I'm not DTF.  That's the number one pickup line.  What is DTF?  Down to fuck.  Oh, well.  You haven't been watching?  And then what happens?  They are.  Yes.  Always.  Whenever they say it, they are.  I'm not saying, I'm not labeling you as that because they asked you.  That's what happens.  Jimmy says, I'm not HIV.  And then he is.  It's true.  I didn't get it.  I didn't get it.  It's true.  What the fuck guys mean?  If you say that you're an 80, then you're really not.  Exactly. 
[03:11:30]  If you have to say something, then.  Yeah, so I understand that.  So are you going to say it?  Well, you guys asked me the question, so that's why I answered it.  Yeah.  So we kind of know what happened.  I think that anything's possible, though.  You know, like, you don't plan those type of things.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, even if you're a girl that doesn't have sex with every guy.  Oh, he's good.  Once in a while, you know what I mean?  Like, you meet that guy and it's spontaneous and it's an actual experience that you can remember  for the rest of your life in a good way.  You know what I'm saying?  It's true.  It's true.  You just go with the flow. 
[03:12:00]  That, by the way, is why Vinny is very good.  Yeah.  Because that's his feel-out move right there.  Right, right.  When he goes like, well, anything can happen.  If a girl goes, oh, no, it can't, she's not getting a date.  Right.  But if she agrees, then she could be a hassle.  You know, there could be a connection.  I can see that.  It's hard.  You can't predict the future.  It's everything in life.  Yeah.  Uncle Nino, how long do you wait before you have sex with a girl?  What?  Yeah.  She's on her way up.  Minus 30 seconds.  30 seconds?  Minus 30 seconds.  Minus 30 seconds.  It comes before she walks in the fucking room. 
[03:12:30]  She's on her way up.  She looks like a vampire.  We got funny listeners, man.  Mark in Chicago.  Did Uncle Nino get a Jackie the Joke Man CD for Christmas?  No, because he hasn't stalked me yet.  Oh, get the fuck out of here.  This is truth serum.  No kidding.  Who's stalking you?  What?  Who's stalking you?  Jackie.  He's stalking you?  Hey, guys.  Oh, it's here.  Hold on a minute.  We're getting some dirt.  He emails me more than Jesus himself.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[03:13:00]  I read your emails.  Snooze and delete.  What?  That's one thing.  We have a comment, Howard and I.  We don't like someone.  Get the fuck out of here.  What are you doing?  Holy shit.  Don't worry.  It's not an A-lister.  We're safe.  Even Google doesn't know who he is anymore.  Oh, wow.  He Google-bombed it.  Google-bombing what?  The best wine in the world.  Holy shit.  This is true serum.  Those Staten Island grapes.  It's true.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:13:30]  That really is.  Wow.  Wow.  You're getting a lot of stress out today, Roland.  Roland, any other guests or potential guests, bookings, people that we wanted on the show  that have been on the show that you might have had issue with?  No, just him and Colin Kane.  Colin Kane?  Oh, no.  What's your problem with Colin Kane?  He's a good guy, right?  He is.  Who the fuck is that?  Don't be a liar.  So what's the problem?  Come on.  He doesn't like me. 
[03:14:00]  Why doesn't he like you?  Oh, everyone likes Roland.  Yeah, we all like Roland.  Fun guy.  I don't know.  What happened, Roland?  Why doesn't he like you?  Well, guys, I can't say.  You can too.  Come on.  How do you say in Italy, once they're an asshole, always an asshole?  I know that's a bestie mid, that's a bestie mid.  Yeah.  You only a king.  What did he just say?  That was slag, Cecilia.  What did he just say?  He's slag.  Roland, speak Italian.  I like a lot of bestie mid.  I like a lot of bestie mid.  Bestie mid.  I like a lot of bestie mid. 
[03:14:30]  No.  Roland, we need more Italian from you.  Speak Italian a little more.  Vinny's right.  Bushi, bushi, Pavarotti.  I gotta do poopy, poopy.  So wait, did he call him anything nice to you?  He's nice to everybody.  Yeah, he's very nice.  What happened?  He can say it.  What happened?  I don't know.  I mean, do you trust the snakes?  Oh, really?  No, I didn't say that.  Trust what?  It's all right.  Trust what?  Whatever.  He said, trust.  I guess he's saying something about trust.  How do you say, how do you say, fuck you in Jewish? 
[03:15:00]  Trust me.  Trust me.  Trust me.  For the post line.  Did you see that?  I like that.  You got moves, Nina.  You just got moves.  Oh, how come all Jewish men get circumcised?  Why?  Because all Jewish women always want 10% off.  What the fuck?  Ken, you like that one.  Ken, you like that one.  Yeah.  You like that, Ken, you?  Dominicans love Jewish.  He's a Jewish old man crossing the street. 
[03:15:30]  He gets in by a car.  If you can make a girl there.  He's laying in the middle of the street.  Yeah, that's good.  He's laying in his back.  So the massacre close by.  They walk over him and say, sir, are you all right?  He says, I'm okay.  He says, sure you're all right.  He says, I'm okay.  He says, are you comfortable?  He says, yeah, I got a few dollars in the bank.  What do you call Jewish fig?  Oh, come on, bro.  What's the F words?  No.  No.  Come on.  E blue.  E blue.  You need the fucking money.

We didn't say stop with the case.  Nina, tell the idea.  Stop with the case.  The gay shit.  Oh, shit.  You know what it is?  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  Don't blow up your nephew's career.  It's not like the old days.  The good old days.  It's not.  In like 1975.  Where, you know, you tell these jokes.  Now everybody's all politically correct.

You like the N word.  No.  All B.  All B.  He's breaking the microphone right now.  We got your back.  By the way, that means yes.  There's no way Uncle Nino has any black jokes.  There's no way he would have any.  No.  No.  Now that he put the word in his mind, it's going to slip out. 
[03:17:00]  It's in his mind now.  Exactly.  There's no control.  No.  Get the fuck out of here.  I see a lot of people getting fired today.  Oh my God.  Including me.  Yeah.  A conga line.

Yeah, you're on  I'm not  They so are  Oh  You have no pull  Cause they're out in the hallway? 
[03:34:30]  Yeah  They'd rather be hanging out in the hallway  Vinny!  Vinny's with Sway  Vinny's talking to Mr. Sway  Tell Sway and Vinny to bring the conversation in here  And Frank Lucas  I don't mean to reprimand you, Kenny  My  You already put your headphones down, Opie?  He's leaving  Opie, you just got here  You gotta be effin' kidding me  You just got here  You couldn't get anyone else in here  So I'm not staying  Kenny's working on it  He's not working on it  Besides, if I don't have you in here  What's my pull? 
[03:35:00]  I'll be right back  Oh, Eric, you're gonna try for me?  Yeah, I'll be right back  Well, Opie, you're not helping  Forget about  Oh, Opie left  Forget about  Come back in here  Kenny, come in here  Who's that guy?  Next week?  Next week?  Oh  Mars  Everybody's gone  Yeah  E-Rock's doing something  Well, E-Rock has been successful in the past at doing things  This is after Opie and Anthony Live, of course  My name's Sam Roberts  We just had a hell of a show 
[03:35:30]  If for some reason you're just tuning in now  And this is what you hear  You really have bad timing  Because we just had  Vinny and Uncle Nino from New Jersey  Shorten for the last two hours  Dina joined us  Roland got all fucked up  And I mean  Now you're just listening to Ron and Fez interns  Put the banners up  It's not comparable  Comparable even  What's going on with E-Rock?  Is he doing anything  Or is he just  Helping his cousins out?  Mars, you're my only guy 
[03:36:00]  I can count on here  I saw Frank Lucas here  He's a guy who was in  A while back  He's a guy  American Gangster was based off of  He was in doing Shade 45  I see Eric running back by himself  This is bad news  He just nodded his head  What does that even mean?  I don't know  There he is  What happened?  Um, well  How do I put this?  Alright, so  Vinny's in with Sway  Oh, he's still here  He's still here  Okay, I can  But Opie's taking Nino down to the street 
[03:36:30]  To do jokes on the street  Well, go into Sway's studio  I can't right now  Why? Is it locked?  No, he's on the  They're on the air talking right now  Listen, Eric  I don't think I should be the one  To have to tell you  You're a radio star, okay?  I don't think you should be the one  To tell me to do anything  Since it's your show  You should go over there  And walk into some other live broadcast  And tell them  I want your guests  To come back on my show  Did he just leave Mars?  Was that Vinny that just walked out?  No  Are you sure?  Yes  That was Spencer  I thought I saw he was wearing a hat 
[03:37:00]  That was Spencer  Oh, okay  So that's going on in there  So you think  As the host of this show  I should start walking in  To other shows  And just say  Excuse me  I see the guest you're interviewing  With a live mic  Come with me  You'll be on my show  Or  Should I just go in with a live mic  We'll put all the extension cords  Like the first week we were here  And then  And then just conduct the interview  In their studio  You should go over there  With a live mic  Yeah  And just go in  Sit down with the mic  And just put the mic  Next to the mic  That they're talking into  And pretend that you're also 
[03:37:30]  Part of the interview  How great would that be?  And I could just talk over  Sway the whole time  And just not acknowledge  That there was something else  Going on  And every time Sway asks you a question  You go  Wait, wait, wait  Sway, hang on a second  Sway  Just let me do this  And then you continue going  I got this Sway  This is not, you know  Five to the hour  Every hour on MTV News  I'm conducting this  And Dina's in the studio  Next to her  Next to him  Doing Hits 1  And then going to Cosmo  So I'm trying to see  If I can get her back  For a couple minutes  Yeah, get Dina in here  Between those two things  Because she's a blast in a glass  And we didn't even touch on that 
[03:38:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah  What a crazy show it was  I mean, there is no way  We can get this crew together tomorrow  Because this was a Friday show  I don't care what day of the week  It technically is  That was a Friday show  Yeah, and what we're doing now  Is such a letdown  After that big show  Well, it's always tough  People don't realize  Like, at least there's stuff  To talk about  But it's like  You end  It's just like  Pounding energy  Energy  Energy  Two hours  Of just a party  In this studio  And then 
[03:38:30]  The energy  Kind of gets sucked  Right out of the room  When everybody leaves  And I'm responsible  Even Roland's gone  I don't know where he went  Where's Roland?  I should be talking to Roland right now  You know pizzas are on their way, right?  Did he actually order the pizzas?  Before he came in  For the long run  Of laughing  And drinking  Whatever  He already ran back  To the office  And ordered five pies  Thank God  Because I was worried  That he would take the time  To sober up  And then he wouldn't  Order the pizzas anymore  Because that's just  What Roland needs  After downing a bottle of wine  Is just a box full of carbs  Five pizzas 
[03:39:00]  Where'd he get them from?  Uh, I don't know  He knows  None of his places  That he gets food from  Are bad  Roland, yeah  Because he knows  All the best places  In Manhattan  But I can't believe  I mean, I'm telling you  I was pouring his cups  Like you would pour juice  In a paper cup  Like you'd give someone  A glass of water  I was giving Roland  Glasses of wine  And it wasn't because  I was instigating anything  He kept asking for more  Like I walked by him  And he'd say  Sam, I have a lonely cup here  Next time  We should have a sippy cup  For Roland  Just so you can always 
[03:39:30]  Drink wine out of it  Or something with  A big crazy straw  I want to know  Where Kenya is  She's back on the 19th floor  Well, why does  Everybody leave me?  There's so much  I need to know  Why are you alone?  I don't know, Eric  I think  Who's that?  Oh, those are the  Ron and Fez interns  Now I'm paranoid  Every time I see somebody  Out there in the hallway  What a party it is  That they're gonna leave you?  Who's this tall guy right here?  Let's get him on the after show  Right, Mars?  Uh, I don't know  Who he is  I would love to find out 
[03:40:00]  I would love to ask him  Hold on  Okay  Let's see if we can grab him  Because it looked like  He might be going to the same studio  That Eric said Dina was in  So maybe  If he has to wait  I'll just ask him who he is  Real quick on the after show  Because I'm trying  I gotta do something here, Mars  I have to do something  Because  The energy has just been sucked out  And I'll tell you this  After yesterday's after show  I'm giving Troy the day off  Really, why is that?  He came in here  As just a ball of fighting  And negativity  It was like  It was fun to listen to 
[03:40:30]  Because fights are fun  But there was no  It was very  Sort of hostile  And I think Troy brought  A lot of that in here  So  He's banned for today  That's a big  That's a  That's an important man  Who is it?  His name's Rennie Harlan  He directed like  Die Hard 2  And a whole bunch of  Other big movies  Okay  When is he booked  To come on the after show?  Well right now  He's in Al Q  With Larry Flick  And a hot blonde  Who's the blonde?  I don't know  But she's wearing those  I don't even know  What those pants are  But they're very form fitting 
[03:41:00]  Is she willing to come in?  The red pants?  Yes  You know the one I'm talking about  They're hip huggers  Is she willing to come in here?  She's in there  With the director  And the Al Q people  Alright  That could be our second stop  If you want to grab a mic  We can walk right into there  Yeah we're going to need  A lot of extension cords  Okay  Because I'm going to just go  Studio to studio  Interviewing people  We'll set up a mic  In there  Yeah  In the shade 45  And one in Al Q  And you can do the interviews  With everybody from this studio  We have to do something  To take after  Opie and Anthony live  To the next level  And this

Yes  This is a very interesting tweet  I'm so glad you brought this up  Because I was hoping  And I'll let you announce it  I'm not stealing your thunder  That's okay  But um  I was so glad 
[03:45:00]  Because I saw the tweet  And I've seen  Tweets about it  From the higher ups  So I know it's official  But we just didn't have time  To mention it today  Because  I mean the show was a complete  What's the  What's a good way of saying clusterfuck?  What's a good clusterfuck?  Friday show  It was a Friday show  It was a complete Friday show  But Eric  What is this announcement?  Well the announcement is  We have interns  Returning to the Opie and Anthony  Oh my god  Unbelievable  They said it wouldn't be done 
[03:45:30]  And by the way  I would just like to state for the record  That if Opie and Anthony  Had found out today  That they were not getting interns  Yeah it certainly would have been addressed  But because they found out  That they were getting interns  Yeah I don't know if we'll have time for it  We got a lot of stuff going on  But uh  We're busy people  Yeah nevertheless  We are going to have interns back  Yes  Um  Now  Listen  I go to  When there's promotions and stuff happening  My go to guys is  Travis  Because uh  He handles all the promotions and stuff 
[03:46:00]  So when I have questions  I don't like to address them off the air  I like to keep everybody  Who's listening at home  Involved in my thought process  So I go to Travis  I ask him questions on the air  When I didn't know how the Bobo game worked  I brought Travis in here  I asked him questions on the air  Who am I going to  Since you retweeted Eric  I'm going to ask you  Okay  Who's the guy that I go to  About intern questions  That  Would be me  Eric Nagel is the intern question man  Yes  Okay  So if uh  You want to intern with the program 
[03:46:30]  Uh  You have to get  Uh  School credit  We're not doing freebies  It's not a paid internship  You have to get school credit  And it's not  And it's not a rule that we can bend  It's not our rule  Nope  So you have to  If you're a college student  Uh  And you want to intern for the Opie and Anthony show  How do they apply?  You go to  Siriusxm.com  Slash internships  Mmhmm  You fill out the form there  You select uh  The Opie and Anthony show  And uh  Then we'll contact you  Range an interview  See if you're going to be an intern  For the uh 
[03:47:00]  Fall semester  And listen  I'm going to tell everybody something  Because everybody thinks  You know  Oh  Everybody associates  Internships at the Opie and Anthony show  With just  You know  Disasters  With your  You know  Stunt guys  With your intern Davids  With your whoever's  Let me explain something to you  This is how we judge  If you're a  Glass is half full  Or half empty guy  If you're not going to apply  To this internship  Because you think  All we do is goof on you  And you'll just be an intern David  Then please don't apply  Because if I were in college right now 
[03:47:30]  You know who I would be looking at  And saying  That's the guy I want to emulate  Scorch?  That's the reason  No not Scorch  Oh  Who I would be  You know which former intern  I would be looking at  From the Opie and Anthony show  Saying  I need an internship  I need to do what he did  You know who that would be  Eric?  Danny?  No not Danny  It would be me  Sam Roberts  Oh  I was an intern Eric  I was an Opie and Anthony intern  In case you didn't know  Steve Sturiano  Come in here  I was an Opie and Anthony intern  You can be too  So we're bringing the interns back 
[03:48:00]  If you want to be the next Sam Roberts  It's the only way you're going to be able to do it  Because listen  You're not going to  You're not going to climb this ladder  As fast as I climbed it  But  At least you'll be able to give it a shot  Were you asking to interview Vinny?  Yeah  Roland was awesome enough  Because he just came up to do you guys  Yeah  And then he was getting out of here  And I just said  I was passing by  And I was just like  Roland  If he has time  And Roland hooked it up  So I got 10 minutes with Vinny  And did he do it yet?  He did it  Why is everybody else getting Vinny Eric? 
[03:48:30]  I had no idea  I mean  We were looking for Roland too  So that's where he went  Roland was outside the studio  With his manager  Talking with him  While he was interviewing Vinny  So is Vinny and Sway right now?  No Vinny's gone  I think he was actually  What?  Opie and him were talking after the show  I think he's doing something with Opie  If I'm not mistaken  Mars  You told me he was in with Sway  That's what Eric told me  He was in there for a minute  They walked in  And that was the last I saw him  He never went into Sway  That's what I thought  Ever because  He talked to Sway outside the studio  And him and Sway are going to do something 
[03:49:00]  But I think Vinny's going to do something bigger with him  Like come in for a few hours  And not just a couple minutes  Well Mars  That's the last time I go to you for information  You lost Vinny  No I lost trust in you  Why?  I was following what Eric was telling you  No no no no  No blaming other people  Because you came in here yesterday  And you didn't accept Troy blaming Eric  So I'm not going to accept you blaming Eric  You're right  You're right  If I go to you for information  And you have wrong information  Whose fault is that?  My fault  That's right Mars  I'm glad that you've learned that lesson  And hopefully we'll be able to rebuild  This trust that we once had  I apologize  It won't happen again 
[03:49:30]  Thank you very much Mars  You're a good engineer  You're a better man  He's a good engineer  But a really shitty information relay person  Well he's not a great  He's not a good  I'm always kidding  He's not a good producer  He's not a good engineer  Oh  But he is a great man  He's not a very good producer either  No no no  Very bad  Very poor  Very bad  But Eric was just informing me  And informing the audience  That the interns are coming back  To the Opie and Anthony show  Oh I can't wait  And I was saying  That like  I don't know where your philosophy is on this  But I know some people  Because I've spoken to people  Who said  That they wouldn't want to intern 
[03:50:00]  Because of the interns  That we've goofed on in the past  And to me  This is  A person who would say this  Is a person who  Not only is pessimistic  But will never be successful in life  Because it's just a horrible outlook  To have on everything  And that's something  That you carry with you  What people don't realize  Who think like that  Is Sam Roberts  Danny Ross  Travis back there  Yeah  All former interns  Of the Opie and Anthony show  D-Boy  We should talk about D-Boy 
[03:50:30]  I don't know  Well yeah  We have time to do that  But all these people  Successful in radio  I'm hosting this hour now  Yeah  I started as an intern  So if you're sitting there  And saying  Man how do I get  To be the next big thing  In radio  Like Sam Roberts is  And not get paid for it  That's not nice  Why would you say that?  Yeah that's not cool at all  I mean  Did you get your raise?  Why would you bring that up?  I was trying to talk about the interns  Not cool  I just thought maybe  You know  We should talk about it some more  It's a real lack  Of professionalism 
[03:51:00]  Bringing that up on the air  Really Steve  Do you get paid more than Sam?  I don't think that's  I don't think my salary  That's a private conversation  You should have one show  Right Steve?  Steve has multiple shows  Does he really?  Steve is on Funny in the Morning  Steve is the host of the phone show  Steve is the host of  Sundays with Steve  That's right  On Raw Dog  Troy  No no no  What do you have to  Because I banned you for today  He banned you  I don't know if you heard that  But I banned you for today  No I missed it  I was in the studio  Well don't  Speak off mic  You can speak but off mic 
[03:51:30]  Don't put the mic  Because I banned you  This isn't going to go well  Because  I told Mars  I didn't do it Troy  It's not for life  It's just for today  Because yesterday  You had a lot of hostility in here  And when I left the after show  I felt that there was an overwhelming  Sense of hostility  That went along with it  No there's no hostility  Well I felt that there was  So I thought it would be best  Don't ban me  Just for today  Just for today  Off mic you can talk  But just for today  You're banned  Florentine and Norton  Are you doing stuff with them? 
[03:52:00]  No I'm not doing anything with them  Why are we doing this on microphone?  He's off mic  I'm not on mic  He's off mic  Okay I'm going to  Why don't you go figure out this  I'm going to go  I like Jim Norton  And I don't want to make him mad  We're not going to make him mad  What about Florentine?  Jim Norton more so  I'm not going to make Jim Norton mad  More so  No Florentine said he's doing something with him  How about we go outside the studio  And talk about like normal fucking human beings  Instead of live on the air  This is why you're banned  This is a show  This is what the show's all about  It is you're right about that  That is a good idea  It's not about raw dog conversations 
[03:52:30]  It is  A lot of it is  It's called Jim Norton  But yeah  And where's Roland?  Jim Norton  Where's Roland?  He's not drinking wine anywhere  Troy where's Roland?  He's ordering pizza  Where the fuck is he?  Tell him to come in here  People want to hear from Roland  He's running all around  He can just order the pizza on the air  Yes  Let me see if I can find him  He told me he already ordered the pizza  Can you release my band then?  If you find Roland  And you don't have a lot of time  Look at you  Well I'm saying  There's not a lot of time left in the show  And  You know 
[03:53:00]  I mean  You understand why I band him right?  I understand  There was so much hostility yesterday  And Eric  Yeah  That conversation  From yesterday  Wasn't about being hostile to you  But  The minute  I mean  Troy came in  And he snapped at Mars  Real quick  Yeah  Right away  And he was incorrect  You were right  Troy was wrong  But he snapped at you  And then he started like  It was more like  Hey everybody  Eric's coming to work on time  And he's not getting credit for it  But Troy changed it around to 
[03:53:30]  I don't like Eric  I don't like Eric  And it was like  There was a lot of hostility  Remember when  Troy started with us  I admitted I was wrong though  You're banned  You're banned  You're banned for today  Out of here  Out  You said if I found that  You're going to release that  Well where is he?  I don't know  I'm looking for him  There's no way I would have missed him  If he was behind you buddy  I would have seen him  Trust me on that  Troy comes in again  I'm putting the show on hold  How are you going to put it on hold?  Remember the old hold music?  Maybe you should  I'm going to have to  If Troy comes in again 
[03:54:00]  I'm throwing the show on hold  That's a sacrifice  I'm willing to make  How long is  See I want to  In honor of  Did we find out  Eric?  See if you can find out  What happened to YSP  Okay  We were supposed to find out  Later this morning  Is what all the articles said  Because at the beginning  Of the show today  Opie and Anthony  Brought up  WYSP  Flipping Formats  Which is a radio station  In Philadelphia  Where our old executive producer  Is working  Steve C  It was an old affiliate for us  Yeah 
[03:54:30]  We were on YSP for a while  Then we were replaced  By Danny Bonaduce's morning show  And now Steve  Is the executive producer  Of Danny Bonaduce's morning show  However  In the first hour of today's show  Which is hard to remember  That anything besides  Uncle Nino and Vinny  Happened today  But that was today  In the first hour of today's show  O&A were talking about  How they were flipping formats  And I was supposed to come down  Today this morning  So I don't know  If any of that's out there  But I would love to 
[03:55:00]  Find out  If it is  Eric's looking that up right now  Eric's good like that  I also  I mean  We just ran out of time  Because I wanted to play Mars  Opie brought up  Peeing on the book today  And I thought  This would be just a perfect day  To replay Opie  Peeing on a book  How long has that been  We don't have time  We don't have time  Because we gotta get out of here  Ron and Fez  Are coming up next  So we have to make sure  That we get out of here  In time for that  Oh somebody  On the feedback  Is saying something about 
[03:55:30]  That I appreciate  That they're saying  Nice things about me  But they're saying  That the internet feed  Is in a loop  Is that people's  Individual phones?  Perhaps  A lot of problems  Do occur  For reference to your phone  Maybe if you shut  The coverage  Do you think if you shut your phone  On and shut it back on  That's a good try  But you know  I mean but people  Because I guess  The show kind of breeds this  I think there's a lot  Of people  Who call in  Or feedback  To O&A  Whatever  Before they try to fix  Their own problems 
[03:56:00]  Like they're like  Yeah my car doesn't get  The radio station either  Yeah shit don't work  Do you have best of XM?  No  Well okay  Try that  Nobody tries to solve  The problem  Themselves  Before calling in  Because they want to get on  The I'm complaining  About something bandwagon  Exactly  So I think  There's some of that  Not to say O&A  Are doing that  I'm saying the callers  No no yeah  I think there's some of that  Doing that  But also  Not to say  I mean look  We get enough complaints  About the online feed  There is a problem  But hopefully  Is what I'm saying  You'll be able to  Restart your phone  I don't think 
[03:56:30]  YSP flipped yet  Their sites  And their feed  Is still up  Somebody is texting in  From Philly  Steve H from Philly  Says they dump rock  On September 6th  September 6th  Is a very special day  In Philadelphia  Because that's my birthday  And I know the people  In Philly love me so much  That they celebrate that  Like Rocky  You know what I mean  It's a big deal  Down in Philly  So I guess they dump rock  On September 6th  You were born in Philly?  No no no  I'm just saying  That they happen  To have an affection for me  Right  I don't know  But why is that?  I don't know  I didn't create it  There's Troy Can't Find Roland  Look who's still banned 
[03:57:00]  I should lock the door  Oh fuck  Too late  No  What?  I'm answering your question  Where is  No  Don't touch that mic  Troy  Turn it off  That mic's off  Where is  Is he here?  He went  Downstairs with the Jersey Shore people  That's what Rob Cross said  That was like 25 minutes ago  That's what Rob Cross said  He's probably drinking  Yeah it's on  Enough with him  It's on FMQB  That YSP flips on September 6th  Oh wow  Okay so YSP flips on September  Does it say what they're doing  In the mornings or anything?
