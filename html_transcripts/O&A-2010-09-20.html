<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts employing vulgar language to describe their show and their perceived standing in radio. Jim Norton, a frequent guest, was in studio, recounting a frustrating experience navigating severe airport traffic caused by a major storm, humorously prioritizing his near-missed TV appearance over the storm-related death of a woman.  This led to morbid jokes about the relative safety of various groups.  The conversation then shifted to Norton’s harrowing drive through the storm-ravaged city, contrasting his travel woes with the tragic consequences faced by others.  A brief mention of Jay Leno praising their show followed before the hosts announced that Kevin Smith would be joining remotely from his car.  A lengthy, profane debate about the superiority of Fios over Time Warner Cable ensued, detailing negative experiences with Time Warner and highlighting Fios's superior technology and features like the Red Zone channel, prompting an enthusiastic explanation of its fast-paced, multi-game coverage.  The discussion included various sports anecdotes, such as a baseball player being impaled by a bat.

The conversation eventually returned to Kevin Smith, who joined from his car, sharing his own travel woes and a story about a friend's extreme constipation during heroin addiction.  Further discussions of sports and celebrities, including Lindsay Lohan, filled out the segment, all punctuated by frequent offensive and vulgar language from the hosts and guests.

A subsequent segment focused heavily on anecdotes about bodily functions and personal experiences.  It began with a story about a friend cleaning out a deceased woman's apartment and discarding her belongings, prompting reflection on the ephemerality of life and friendship.  This transitioned into graphic descriptions of defecation in various unusual places. The conversation then shifted to masturbation while driving, followed by a detailed discussion about Fleshlights, their features, cleaning, and psychological impact. Kevin Smith, again a guest, extensively shared his experiences with Fleshlights and recounted stories from his cross-country travels on his tour bus (acquired after a negative air travel experience).  The segment ended with an announcement of the Smodcast podcast moving to Sirius XM and a discussion of the hosts' contract negotiations.

Another segment featured Kevin Smith discussing a host's infected boil, leading to discussions of MRSA and other infectious diseases, including graphic descriptions and images of STIs and infestations like pubic lice in eyelashes and "blue waffle."  The conversation veered into celebrity gossip (Lindsay Lohan and Ashton Kutcher), Smith's film *Cop Out* and its mixed reception, and his frustrations with lazy media coverage, using Ben Affleck’s *The Town* press tour as an example. The segment included listener questions, hinting at future discussions of comic book movies and the *Smodcast*'s return to Sirius XM.  

A later segment started with Smith recounting a bad Southwest Airlines experience, followed by reminiscing about embarrassing early interviews and career experiences. This flowed into a discussion of uncomfortable-to-watch television shows, featuring a former *Friends* actress, and a comparison to the UK version of *The Office*.  A contentious interview between Terry Gross and Gene Simmons was dissected, playing audio clips highlighting Simmons's offensive remarks. Smith shared an anecdote about a previous encounter with Simmons. The discussion included Simmons's reality show, *Family Jewels*. Smith then discussed his Batman comic, *The Widening Gyre*, and the online backlash to Batman’s bladder spasm.  The segment included listener calls focusing on Smith's participation in a hockey tournament, his large television, and his BP stock investment after the oil spill, culminating in an awkward interaction involving a blind employee assisting Smith.

Another segment began with a failed comedic bit with a fan, followed by a discussion of the VMAs (Cher's appearance) and Gene Simmons's hair.  Caller Darren explained his unusual name origins, while another caller prompted a discussion of superhero movies (*The Dark Knight*, *Green Lantern*, *Captain America*).  A poignant call from listener John, who shared how Smith's *Clerks* helped him cope with his wife's death and his subsequent romantic life, led to a discussion about grief, and compared it to George Carlin's experience. The conversation shifted to music, Smith's limited tastes, and the changing media landscape, culminating in reminiscences about cassette players. The final part focused on horror movies (*Friday the 13th*, *The Shining*), analyzing plot points, actors, and personal reactions, including a detailed discussion of *The Shining*'s bathtub scene and Kubrick’s directing style and relationship with Shelley Duvall.

A final segment heavily focused on *The Shining*'s cinematography, particularly Steadicam shots and Kubrick's directing style. In-studio guest Danny, presumably a filmmaker or camera operator, explained the Steadicam's mechanics. The conversation shifted to  Jack Nicholson's performance and Shelley Duvall's character, utilizing explicit and offensive language, and dissecting the absurdity of plot points. The segment included discussions of road closures in NYC due to high-profile visits, concluding with the guest promoting his shows, a hockey podcast plug, and Kevin Smith discussing a *Breakfast Club* 25th-anniversary screening, speculating about Emilio Estevez's absence, and Jim Norton's humorous question about a potential romance between Ally Sheedy and John Candy in *Only the Lonely*.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shut up!  Get us back to the funny.  But first, let's play this.  People understand we don't belong in radio, right?  Satellite radio douchebags?  I take that as like a compliment.  Yes, we suck a dick.  Sorry to everybody out there.  This is fucking satellite fuck dick radio. 
[00:00:30]  Holy shit.  What a great show.  We heard you.  I don't want to make everyone feel bad,  but you know this is what old people sit around and do.  Pretty porn, semen squirting, and shoot up the job.  Oh, what the fuck?  This morning has been, I feel like I'm on Jerry Springer.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the roll.  Here we are.  Good morning.  Here we are.  You're listening to the number one show on satellite radio. 
[00:01:00]  Hey, man, Jay Leno said it, so it must be true.  Morning, morning, morning.  Jim Norton back from L.A.?  Yes.  Thank goodness we missed you, Jimmy.  That storm traffic, going to the airport.  Oh, yeah.  I literally, at one point, I was so buggy,  I almost got out of the car and just started walking on the Grand Central.  Like, I didn't know what to do.  I was going to miss, I walked in for an 825 flight because they called me that day to come out.  Yeah.  I walked into the airport 808.  Wow. 
[00:01:30]  An 825 flight.  And they let me on the plane because they knew that there was a big weather problem.  Sure.  You would have missed your plane.  I heard it was like a little late, your plane leaving.  It was a little bit late.  It wasn't that bad.  And it was probably because Obama was in town, so I think they had runways closed and stuff.  So, yeah.  Well, when we get a storm like we did last week, you've got to expect it, though, right?  But that was, dude, it was horrible.  It's the worst traffic I've ever hit.  It was one of the worst storms to hit.  Yeah, it was bad.  But of course.  As far as thunderstorms go.  And I'm so self-centered.  Like, I know a woman died, a tree went through, which is horrible. 
[00:02:00]  Her family has to deal with that.  Ow.  But this is what a self-centered ass I am.  I'm actually, like, I talk to God.  Yeah.  Like, I'll get mad or I'll say thanks for good things.  And I'm actually like, what the fuck, dude?  Like, I'm actually mad that I'm going to be late for a plane to perform on a TV show when I know there's a dead lady.  Yeah.  Yeah, when you're getting on a plane, don't say what the fuck, dude, to God. 
[00:02:30]  Well, he understands.  You might take him personally.  He doesn't mind.  Yeah, you might take his finger and just flick your plane.  Right.  And say, fuck you.  This is what I do now.  Like that bus full of church people.  That van full of church people.  Dude, it's just amazing.  God doesn't give a fuck.  I tweeted that yesterday.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Really?  Right?  What was it?  A Bronx bishop and just church do-gooders.  And they were going too fast.  A tire fucking popped or something.  Oops.  Everyone's dead.  Wrong God.  Wrong religion.  Oh, really?  X that one off.  Oh, that's that.  That's what I would do. 
[00:03:00]  Anytime something happens to a group of church people.  You X that religion off as being the religion.  And you move on to something else until you reach a religion where if you're doing a church  activity and nothing ever happens to anybody, that's the religion.  There's two scenarios I never want to be in.  I don't want to be in a van with a bunch of churchgoers ever.  No, no.  And I don't want to be on a bus to Atlantic City to gamble with the old people.  Those are the bad ones.  Is there any more to add to that list? 
[00:03:30]  I don't know.  Those, it always seems like the churchgoers have dying fiery accidents and old people  going to gamble.  That's because have you ever been on one of those buses going to Atlantic City?  I've never been.  Have you been?  Oh yeah, yeah.  Years ago.  And the bus driver's just like, the bus is sitting there rocking back and forth just  going, blah, blah, blah.  Like 110 miles an hour down the fucking turnbite.  Blah. 
[00:04:00]  They don't give a shit.  The driver's half asleep.  He really is.  He's as old as the people on the bus.  And they end up in the woods.  Oh, it's crazy.  Right off the fucking highway, into the woods, bus roof gets ripped off, and somehow some  of the old people make it through.  Unbelievable.  They pull through.  Unbelievable.  Hey, that lady that was killed, did she?  I heard she pulled.  Which lady?  The one that the tree fell on her?  Where did the tree fall on her?  Jewel Avenue.  I think the Grand Central, or it might have been the VanWick. 
[00:04:30]  I heard it was raining so hard that she pulled over because she couldn't see and wanted to  be safe.  And when she pulled over, the limb fell and fucking...  Oh, wow.  But let me tell you something.  What a bad place to fucking pull over.  Jimmy doesn't know because he was in L.A.  I was stuck in Central Park.  I was in the middle of a bike ride when that thing hit.  And as far as rain goes, I don't think I've ever seen it rain harder in my life.  It was like a wall.  And it was like a wall of water.  It was so bizarre how much rain was coming down at one time. 
[00:05:00]  And then getting hit in the head with the hail was no fun.  Oh, did it hail too?  Oh, yeah.  Not as much in Central Park as in Brooklyn.  Because Brooklyn really got the brunt of the storm.  So I don't blame her is what I'm saying.  I don't know how you would have driven in that.  I think you would have had to pull over.  Yeah, pull over, not under a tree.  If she pulled over, like what, five, ten feet sooner or later, she would be alive today.  Yeah.  Maybe, because I finally got by.  We jumped off the Grand Central, jumped on the Whitestone Express to get to JFK. 
[00:05:30]  And it was literally, there was like five downed massive trees in a row.  Oh, wow.  Like, I couldn't, I've never seen anything like that on a highway.  There was like three or four, and then you went for like maybe, you know, 30 seconds,  and there was like a couple of more.  It was fucking horrible.  Wow.  Don't make the trip to the airport a bitch.  But, I mean, you know, God was looking out for me because I made my flight.  Maybe her not so much.  Yeah.  But me getting on the plane.  You're more important to God.  But that's what a self-centered idiot I am.  I actually think that he was concerned with me. 
[00:06:00]  Of course.  And everyone believes God cares about what they're doing at the moment.  He doesn't.  Would you have your cabbie run over a dead body to get you to the airport quicker?  I'd have him run over a live person to get me done.  Dead body.  Dead body.  Who cares about that?  A live woman giving birth.  Yeah.  It's not as important.  How's our pal Jay Leno doing?  He's good, man.  How's he doing in the ratings and all that?  He's doing all right?  I think he's doing well.  I didn't ask.  But he seemed to be in great spirits.  The mood there.  The exec producer.  Everybody's in a great mood.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Man, he loves poking the king of all media, doesn't he? 
[00:06:30]  I don't think he thinks of it.  Poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke.  He just loves you guys.  I know.  And we love him.  He's great.  Honestly, he has never mentioned poking anybody.  He always asks how you guys are doing.  He's like, I hear the show is doing great.  We are doing great.  People have talked to him about the show.  So he's very happy.  I mean, it's our last week of our contract, but we're doing great.  Oh, my God.  What a week last week was. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And that's what we do.  We come in Monday and go, I don't know.  How are you going to top it?  Ah, whatever.  It's just amazing.  I know how we top it.  Kevin Smith is in a car to do our show.  That's great.  The entire show today.  Oh, is he going to be in a little show?  Yeah.  An entire show from his car?  What?  I don't know.  Yeah, I guess.  He's in a car to do the show?  I mean, if you know anything about Kevin Smith, he might as well.  He does smodcasts all over the place.  Yes.  And they're great smodcasts.  He doesn't need an actual, you know, multi-million dollar studio.  No, we don't.  And obviously, we don't either.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:07:30]  Piece of shit studio.  That works.  Yeah.  I guess.  I don't know.  We come into our windowless little box.  The way I look at it is, as long as the audio gifts I'm giving are received in those  filthy listener ears.  Yay.  I literally, sometimes I think that every five minutes, someone should call up and just  go, you know what?  Thank you, guys.  Thank you for the audio gifts.  Little ass kissing.  Auditory gifts.  Is today thank you day?  It should be.  Every day should be thank you.  This show should be four hours of talk broken up in five minute increments with thank yous. 
[00:08:00]  With thank yous from everybody.  Every single person listening.  Well, you want to talk a little football?  Football.  My God.  Fucking Jets had a nice game against the Pats.  They certainly did.  First half was so-so and then the second half, they fucking routed him.  They unloaded.  Brady did not look like a happy man every time he fucking unsnapped that helmet.  He just was like, ah, there goes.  You guys are in trouble up there with this Brady. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  He's got a Justin Bieber haircut.  Did you see his Justin Bieber haircut?  Yes, I did.  Slow with this guy.  The ladies find him very attractive, Opie.  Very attractive gentleman.  On the clear blue skies.  You really got down.  I fucking was doing that all weekend.  I love your Ira.  I don't need to see him.  I just want to hear you do it.  I can't get enough of just talking like him.  How he said cock on Friday is...  Maybe the guys can find it for Jimmy. 
[00:09:00]  And sucker, Thursday, come by.  I'll invite you to my sucker.  I'm going.  You're going to his sucker?  Oh, I'm so going.  Jimmy, you want to go?  It's on 42nd Street.  He invited us.  What's his sucker?  Where you kind of let your hair down after...  It's a celebration.  After Yom Kippur.  Of what?  To celebrate.  And you're just like, why?  Why?  He never gives you an answer.  Because he's a boob.  He is a boob. 
[00:09:30]  The man is a fool.  I like how Stinky comes in as his handler.  Yeah.  And just sits in the chair and laughs.  Sat him.  I know.  Well, Stinky knows.  I mean, he worked with us for a few years.  So he knows what we're capable of.  Oh, yeah.  And he doesn't want to go back to Jay Thomas with a broken Ira.  Oh, no.  He's got a line.  Right.  Exactly.  He's got a...  He knows.  He's the line.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He knows.  We could talk with Ira.  He can say things.  But the second we want Ira.  They made me pull down my pants.  And I had my cock out. 
[00:10:00]  Like, he doesn't need that.  I just want Stinky to go, all right, guys, enough.  Yeah.  Let's push it one day where he has to do that.  With Stinky has to throw in a towel.  All right.  All right.  My guy's out.  Right.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  The Jets look good.  Yeah.  Cowboys.  Cowboys.  Wow.  Redskins beat him.  What was it?  27-20, something like that?  That was now Chicago.  I mean Chicago.  Sorry.  Redskins beat him the first week.  Right, right, right, right, right.  Yeah.  Sorry about that. 
[00:10:30]  I didn't see the game, to be honest.  You didn't watch?  No.  Why didn't you watch?  I slept till five.  I flew home the day before.  It was just a whole...  Were your arms killing you?  No, no.  It wasn't a plane, man.  I can't find a person.  Right?  Sorry.  I forgot.  Did you guys...  Did you guys see Randy Moss's catch?  Yeah, one-handed.  Holy shit.  You raked that one right in.  I was fucking with the pass fans all afternoon, but, I mean, you've got to give it to Moss.  That catch was the one for the...  What happened?  Oh, should they write a book about it? 
[00:11:00]  Should he write a book?  The catch?  Dude, did you see the catch?  Yes.  It was amazing.  One hand, he pulls it in.  It is amazing.  The only reason the other guy had to write a book about the catch, because that was it  for him.  Yeah.  Randy Moss has a bunch of highlights, okay?  David Tyree, right?  Yeah.  Our famous David Tyree interview.  We didn't care enough to stick around for the interview.  We franchised that one out, didn't we?  I like how Patrice wrote, like, Rivas pulled a moss string.  Yeah.  Yeah, then Rivas... 
[00:11:30]  Rivas got burned so bad that he had to leave the...  He had to leave for the rest of the game.  Yeah, he was done.  And everyone was coming to his defense going, no, he looked a little shaky during warm-ups.  And he got burned so bad, he's like, I gotta get myself off this fucking field.  Yeah.  That looked real bad.  Ow!  I mean, I'm...  Oh, my arm!  I'm a Jets fan, and that was very suspicious.  And he all of a sudden...  Pulled a hammy.  He pulled a hammy.  Yeah.  He pulled a Rodney Dangerfield.  Oh, my arm!  I think it's broken! 
[00:12:00]  But that catch, unbelievable.  That's just ridiculous.  Yeah, that's...  Hey, Ann, I saw your tweet.  You checked out the Red Zone for the first time?  Yeah, yeah.  I got the Fios, of course.  I'm jealous of you, Red Zone fucks.  I don't get it with my cable system.  Why don't you get Fios you have in the building?  No, we don't have...  They're wiring it.  Oh, okay.  I don't know if it's official yet.  Oh, you gotta get it.  I didn't get the memo, because as soon as I get the memo, I'm done. 
[00:12:30]  By the way, they...  Done with stupid...  What is it, Time Warner?  Yeah.  Is that what we got in Manhattan?  I don't even know.  I guess it's Time Warner.  Time Warner's commercial yesterday.  I saw, and it's...  I can't remember his name, but it's some guy.  And he's talking about how phony Fios is.  He's going, it's phony, because they say they have the most HD channels.  And some of the channels that they're adding up as the number of HD channels are kind of  redundant channels.  Because you could get HD, HBO, but then there's HD, West Coast HBO, and stuff. 
[00:13:00]  But it's like, that's still a different HD channel for what I'm watching here.  Right, right.  And then I'm thinking, this whole selling point to this commercial is them saying, yeah,  they have more HD channels, but they're like some duplicates.  It's like, who cares?  They still have a fuckload of HD channels, and more than your stupid fucking service.  Oh, and I had a guy just come and knock on my fucking door from cable, Cablevision. 
[00:13:30]  They want you back?  You recently left?  I'm like, yeah.  Can you tell us why?  Yeah.  Boom, boom, boom.  But I went on a fucking tear.  And just told the guy for like five straight minutes, telling him why I went and switched.  And he had no answer but News 12.  But what happened to these cable companies?  I told him.  I told him.  They let everyone else catch up.  And now you've got, in my case, Time Warner.  It just looks old.  Archaic.  It looks old. 
[00:14:00]  I told the guy.  There's so much going on with TV now.  I said, you guys at Cablevision ran Long Island for years.  Since cable came around, you were the guys.  You did nothing but give us the minimum, whatever you had.  And we paid huge prices for it.  Never worked on new technology.  Now there's options that are more technologically advanced than Cablevision.  I noticed it.  And I switched to it.  And I go, and I really, I can't imagine switching back. 
[00:14:30]  Because I don't think you can offer me anything that I'm not getting now.  What are you paying?  How many boxes do you have?  I go, you don't understand.  I don't care about the price because I'm getting a better product.  Like you could give, I know you could add up fucking, do your math and say,  I could give you that many boxes in your house for this much less money.  I go with what?  And why didn't they do that before?  Yeah, yeah.  Do that before. 
[00:15:00]  And he goes, and we have, he goes, you know, it takes a lot to get the infrastructure back up  and renovate it.  But we're working on that now.  It's like now, Verizon put in an entirely new fucking infrastructure.  What will you guys do?  Sitting on your fucking piece of shit, breaking down infrastructure.  They got lazy.  With nothing new.  I go, the guide alone.  The guide.  I said, the guide alone for Fios beats the piss out of the Cablevision guide. 
[00:15:30]  In speed, in being able to customize your favorites, in breaking down each color-coded thing for  movies, sports, science shows, whatever.  Do you get the news thing, too?  Yeah.  Where it's like six news channels all on one screen?  Yes.  And then you click on the one you really want to see, and that goes big, that goes full  screen?  It's fantastic.  It's amazing.  They've never had competition, so this is, they don't know how to deal with it because  they never competed against each other.  And it's true fiber optic that you're getting. 
[00:16:00]  It's just.  Somebody tweeted yesterday, and maybe you wouldn't know because you don't do fantasy football,  right?  No.  I'm not a fantasy football guy either, but we all know a lot of people that do fantasy  football.  This guy tweeted a picture where he's watching whatever his game was.  I don't remember now.  And on the left side of the screen, or it was a separate screen, maybe someone could  explain this to me.  It was a fantasy football app, and he had all his players just listed, as big as his  TV, basically.  And it had a running score of how his guys were doing. 
[00:16:30]  See, how great is that?  So he didn't have to go to his computer, because most guys watch football now with the  computers so they could check out their guys to see how their fantasy football team's  going.  I've never seen that before.  Is that on Fios?  I don't know.  It is a Fios app.  Smart activity that is going on is amazing.  So it's a fantasy football app on Fios.  Yeah, you've got all your players on the left side as you're watching the game.  On the right side of the screen.  They found a way to keep you off the computer for that piece of it.  Yes.  That's smart.  And also, you can set game alerts for your own specific team. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  Like, for Red Zone, if you want to watch an actual game on CBS, you can set a game alert  so that when the Patriots are in the Red Zone, it'll pop up on your screen.  You'll go, oh, okay, cool.  And you switch to the Red Zone.  Right.  You've got to be kidding me.  It's great.  Cable sucks.  And you know what that is?  It's true.  We get none of this.  Fiber optic.  It's fiber optics.  That's how they get all this fucking information piped into your fucking house.  Yeah.  Because it's not thick coaxial cable that's an ancient design. 
[00:17:30]  You know what I get?  I get to climb up on a rickety, like, sort of like stool thing to turn off all the power  on my Wi-Fi to reboot.  And I do that probably once a week.  Thank you, Time Warner.  You know what?  Thank you.  I do the same thing with cable.  Thank you.  I've never had to reboot my frigging system with Fios.  Because I have internet through them, too.  I've never had to reboot my modem.  Time Warner has fucked up my online gaming that I don't go online anymore and play.  Because I'll be in the middle of some great, you know, I'm a Tiger Woods guy, golf guy. 
[00:18:00]  And I'll be in some great matches, kicking ass, whatever, having a good round, and all of a sudden,  boom.  Oh, I've got to now reboot my fucking Wi-Fi.  Thank you.  Thank you, Time Warner.  Thank you.  So I'm going to have the cable guy come to my house and try to convince me to come back  to a service I left for multiple reasons.  And I told him, I said, the picture itself is so much better, I don't get the pixelation  and skipping that I was getting.  He had no answer to that.  He's like, did you have somebody come by to repair it? 
[00:18:30]  I go, at least five times.  You've got to feel sorry for that guy.  I know.  He had his little cable vision badge around his neck.  And he's just talking, and his little cable vision pins on his lapel, like, rah, rah,  go, go, cable, cable, slam the door.  I was done.  Oh, with a little pendant?  Oh, yeah.  Pendants?  You want cable vision.  You want, no.  Goodbye.  Sis-boom-ba.  Yeah, rah, rah, sis-boom-ba.  That's, I'm so happy.  Oh, yeah.  And you know what?  Why would they have people fucking walking from door to door, banging on your door to ask 
[00:19:00]  you to come back?  Because they're fucking hurting.  And they never, this is why I hate them.  They never had any competition.  These motherfuckers would stay out of each other's backyards, so no matter what they  did, you were fucked.  Totally fucked.  They had a monopoly.  Now, it's competition, and like I said, just.  I can't wait for files.  Me neither.  I can't fucking wait, because I want to check out some other shit finally.  I'm going to live with you if you have it first.  Fine, no problem.  Move in.  I'll just give you a tookus little nuzzle. 
[00:19:30]  It's an amazing system.  You could babysit my kid, and I could actually, you know, go outside during the weekend.  That would be nice.  Come on.  When I used to go to the guide and try to, like, scroll down the Cablevision guide, and  you'd hit the button and have to fucking sit there.  Now, it's not five minutes per fucking channel that you're waiting for, but that delay was  enough to bug the piss out of you.  We just sit there going, come on.  And then you finally hit the show that you want to watch, and it took forever to just 
[00:20:00]  go to that channel.  I think you like Fios.  We get it.  I know.  I love it.  We get it.  I think you're the CEO of the company or something.  I know.  It's getting a little creepy how much you like it.  You're having a love affair with your Fios.  I pay the bill every month.  I'm not getting a freebie.  They don't sponsor.  They're not a sponsor, as far as I know, on this platform or anything.  I don't know, but all I could say is, from my experience using it, it's fantastic.  There you go.  And then Red Zone, I had my experience with that yesterday.  You're not a big football fan, are you? 
[00:20:30]  No, I'm not, but...  Red Zone will make you a football fan.  I'm telling you.  Do you have to order it, or does it just come with it?  I don't know, because we can't get it.  I just got everything, so I don't even order it.  I only get to see Red Zone when I'm down in Philly.  It's $50 a year.  They have it on Comcast down there.  Really?  Yeah, Comcast has Red Zone.  Wait, Time Warner just doesn't have it?  Yeah.  What fucking douchebags?  Why do I care?  It's a great channel.  Yeah.  It's great.  Although, the guy running it is a little insane. 
[00:21:00]  I was having an anxiety attack watching Red Zone.  Well, for the people that don't know before you, because I know what you're about to do here,  the Red Zone, you pretty much watch the entire fucking league all at once every Sunday.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  You're watching every game at the same time.  It's at the same time, they switch back and forth.  It's like watching the highlights that they used to show on the news live for every fucking game.  Whenever a team is in the Red Zone, meaning getting closer to score, they go right to that game. 
[00:21:30]  They go right to that game.  So they're just popping around the league like this.  And it's happening, like, all the time.  Like, there's going to be a team where something amazing is ready to happen, and they're going back and forth.  I was losing my mind.  I swear, my heart rate was up to about 100 and fucking 90.  Well, that's good.  I'm at the edge of my seat.  It's like exercising.  I had no idea what was going on, yet I knew everything that was going on.  I was in this state like I had been doing cocaine on a weekend bender watching Red Zone. 
[00:22:00]  It was crazy.  And the poor guy that announces this, I was losing my mind.  Watching the Jaguars and the Chargers game, which was hysterical.  Jaguars, we're at Qualcomm Stadium.  Let's go to San Diego and watch Jaguars with another turnover.  That's the sixth one.  Now, holy shit, let's go to the Patriots and Middlelands with New York.  My God, there goes Brady.  And he likes to go.  Oh, the touchdown.  Touchdown.  What an amazing catch. 
[00:22:30]  We'll get back to that replay.  As soon as we go to the Bucs and Panthers and the Bank of America's game, let's go back there.  Oh, my God.  Holy fuck.  Give me some more cocaine.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Let's go back.  We've got to go to Fort Field, Detroit, where the Eagles and Lions.  Holy shit.  Michael Vickson.  Oh, no.  Touchdown.  Holy.  Wait a minute.  The Buccaneers are playing.  I don't even fucking know.  Holy shit.  Let's go to Texas versus the Redskins.  We're here in Washington, D.C.  It's effective on Faggis Field.  It's amazing.  Look at McNabb.  He looks fantastic today. 
[00:23:00]  Eli Manning.  Holy shit.  The Manning brothers are going to be playing later on.  But right now, let's go back to Lambeau Field.  And Green Bay, while the Bills are taking on the Packers.  Aaron Rodgers is taking on the Packers.  Holy shit.  I can't fucking believe it.  Give me some more crystal meth.  I couldn't fucking take it.  Wait, dude.  It's one guy doing all the calls?  One guy.  You haven't seen it yet.  It's awesome.  It's out of fucking control.  And the guy is completely under control.  He has it knocked. 
[00:23:30]  He's got it all figured out.  He knows every player.  I'm sitting there.  My eyes were darting around.  Because also, you get the network feed, whatever network it is, from the Red Zone.  So it'll be the Fox feed on one.  And then it's the CBS feed on another.  So I'm like, where's the score?  Where's the fucking play clock?  I didn't know what to look at.  And then they go split screen and all sorts of stuff.  Oh my God.  And the second something happens, bam, they're in another city.  Where am I? 
[00:24:00]  I don't know.  We're in Oakland.  Holy shit.  It's the Rams and the Raiders.  Oh my God.  Let's go to Cleveland.  What?  Where am I?  I finally, after an hour, I was in a cold sweat and just went to the Jet game.  Oh really?  You had to give up and just go to the Jets?  I was fucking having an anxiety attack watching the Red Zone.  It's fantastic.  Believe me.  And another good thing about it, 
[00:24:30]  you start to get to know key players from every fucking team.  You get to know the whole league.  You don't need to know some of the peripheral guys,  but you start knowing like...  The stars of every team.  You wouldn't give a shit about.  You know the quarterback.  You know the receivers.  You know the key guys.  And then bam, you're on another team.  Holy shit, I know everyone on the Buccaneers.  It's amazing.  What the fuck?  I wish they could figure something out like that for hockey,  but they just can't.  I mean, football is a sport where they all play on Sunday,  so it makes it perfect, you know? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  But something like that for hockey,  because I love my hockey, would be great.  But I don't know.  I don't think they could figure that one out.  You know what I mean?  It would be a great channel.  Third and more than nine.  Every time someone's third down and more than nine,  they just go to them,  and it's one uneventful,  one fucking uneventful out-of-bounds pass.  Third and 27.  Yeah, third and 27.  Horrible number.  The punch channel.  Punts.  All punts.  Nothing but punts.  And a bunch of women tune in at first  because they misunderstand it.  The punch channel. 
[00:25:30]  That would be great.  Oh, my God.  How boring.  It was crazy.  There we go.  Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego.  Let's watch.  Oh, my God.  The Jaguars, their 10th turnover in 10 minutes.  This is a fantastic game.  That was the funniest fucking thing about that.  What?  Jacksonville.  Oh, my God.  How many turnovers did they have yesterday?  I didn't get to see.  It's like six.  Look at Anthony.  He's a football expert.  I was.  I had Red Zone.  One afternoon with the Red Zone.  I had Red Zone.  Now I know everything.  I didn't even get to see a piece of that game.  Oh, you need the Red Zone.  It's fantastic.  Thank you, Time Warner.  Thank you. 
[00:26:00]  Because you know what your people want.  They had that monopoly.  Jesus.  They obviously don't have the technology to do it.  You know what it is with Time Warner, by the way?  You don't need the technology.  You just pump in the channel.  So it must be another dumb contract thing.  You need fiber optic.  Not for the Red Zone if it's just the channel.  Well, you know what?  But no, to have that and to have all the interactive shit that you get with Fios, you need fiber optic  for all that info.  But if Comcast down in Philly has it, then Time Warner should have it. 
[00:26:30]  So I'm starting to think that these motherfuckers are stuck in some kind of contracting negotiation.  I told the Cablevision guy, too.  I go, you know what the final thing was, was that bullshit that happened with ABC and Cablevision.  And I go, look, I don't care whose fault it was.  Because I heard that both sides, Cablevision blaming ABC, ABC was blaming Cablevision.  This was when Lost was winding up, and they chopped fucking ABC off of Cablevision. 
[00:27:00]  And we sat there going, well, we're at their fucking mercy, because where else am I going  to go?  An antenna?  You motherfuckers?  And he was telling me, of course it was ABC's fault, and contracts.  And then he goes, you know, Verizon's going to be having that problem, too, because their  contracts will be coming up.  I go, well, when that happens, then I'll be mad at them.  I go, but right now, I was mad at you guys.  And I called up and said, that's it.  Take all my shit out.  Why did he even bother with the guy?  Because I wanted someone to know from Cablevision to go back and say, wow, perhaps we really fucked 
[00:27:30]  up.  You know, you've seen me do the out-of-control two-door, two-handed door slam.  As soon as the guy said I'm from Cablevision.  Wham!  Not just one-handed.  I do the two-handed door slam.  Wham!  Right in his face.  Why would you talk to the guy?  And then he gave me his card, like, I'm going to call and say, come on back, guys.  Rip all the good stuff out. 
[00:28:00]  Because that's what they do for this guy.  If he gets you to converge back, then he gets a little piece of the action.  Oh, well, you know what?  He's the gatekeeper, man.  No piece of the action at my house, because I am nothing but happy with those fine folks.  Look, I don't give a shit who gives it to me.  I just want new technology.  I just want new and good technology.  I want new technology, because then, you know, we'll take phone calls from people that will explain what they don't like about Fios.  But all I see is that Fios is way ahead of the basic cable companies. 
[00:28:30]  Yes.  Way the fuck ahead.  Way ahead.  And that's all I care about.  And it's because they weren't sitting on their fucking ass while Cablevision and Time Warner was.  You know, Time Warner's worse than Cablevision.  Like, they're not even...  They're terrible.  Yeah.  I don't think they're even trying to get new lines in and shit like that.  It's unbelievable.  And update their fucking cables.  No.  You get a whole bunch of who gives a shit channels.  Can you get the Yes Network on this for the Yankees?  I don't know.  For Fios? 
[00:29:00]  Yes.  You can get everything, right?  Yeah.  What can't you get?  I can't get News 12 Long Island.  Oh, fuck.  Which really upsets the shit out of me.  And I can't get these certain college games.  Yeah.  You can't get MSG and MSG2 in HD.  Yes.  But you can't get...  Cablevision is holding back for some reason.  Oh, those bastards.  But you could get them...  I can't get New York One News either.  But you could get regular MSG?  Yeah.  All right, so...  And I could get Fios One News or whatever it is.  Why is News 12 holding out? 
[00:29:30]  They're like a college TV station.  It stinks.  Cablevision probably pays them.  Who cares about that?  It is a Cablevision.  But for the rest of America, I'm sure...  No one gives a fuck about them.  News 12?  Who cares this...  I'm going to News 12.  I remember, and this is the God's honest truth, 9-11.  The peak of fucking 9-11 while it was like, oh my God, what's happening?  News 12 had a report with a guy from North Shore Animal League talking about puppies.  Oops.  And I'm like, because it was a taped piece.  Oops.  It was taped. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, they run taped pieces over and over again.  Like, why would I give a fuck?  I think that they're so old, their weather guy wears a bow tie.  Does he?  I think so.  Great.  Should have hanged himself with a brooks.  Your fucking news sucks.  And there's no reason to fucking have News 12.  Well, we have News 12.  Oh, yeah.  I'm really missing that.  Who cares?  I put on CNN or Fox or fucking any of the other 24-hour news services.  But first of all, I know what's going on from the internet before I ever turn on TV news. 
[00:30:30]  So why the fuck do I need that?  You don't.  Again, it's for...  You know what Cablevision's for?  You old, powdery-smelling, dying people.  That's who it's for.  I don't know.  This is scaring me.  Technology?  What's an app?  I don't know.  Because you get your apps on top of your file screen when you punch it up.  And you could go...  Well, you get your widgets.  You get widgets?  Yeah, they're the same thing.  I don't get widgets.  You could do your Facebook from fucking, your TV and shit like that. 
[00:31:00]  If you're just hanging out, you do that shit.  I don't get shit.  And Fios does have a local Long Island news channel.  So if you need that...  For what?  Then you could go to it.  But it's like...  Yeah, you can tweet from your cable box.  What?  I can tweet from my fucking television.  I get to stare at my fucking cable.  I don't have to because I got a fucking iPhone.  I just sit there.  But it's, again, old people like, I don't know about that.  But your super saver Lillian doesn't know.  Super saver Lillian loves cable vision.  I watch my programs. 
[00:31:30]  You actually interact with your TV?  That's weird.  It's great.  I could DVR a show.  And then how about...  You could DVR something?  That's about it.  How about if I want to go to, like...  I want to go to On Demand and shit like that.  There's a button that says On Demand.  You hit it, and there's your On Demand shit.  I don't have to scroll through 200 channels of Spanish fucking programming.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.  It was so annoying to have to sit through a...  All the 200s were Spanish programming. 
[00:32:00]  And I was sitting there, and it's like, I can't skip through this.  I can't...  I have to go through.  Telemundo.  How much DVR space do you got?  That's a big one.  I'm sure.  A million gigabytes.  I'm sure.  It's ridiculous.  It's pretty standard, but they're coming out with new boxes later in the year.  Okay.  That'll allow you to actually add on your own storage to it, I think, up to a terabyte.  You can buy a terabyte fucking hard drive, plug it right into the fucking thing, and  then you're rocking that.  How big is the one they got now, do you think?  I don't know.  It is pretty standard. 
[00:32:30]  There's files across the country.  I've never filled mine up, and I was doing Lost in, like, fucking HD.  And, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just gotta, you know...  Well, I guess you like your files.  I love it!  More importantly, are you a Jets fan now?  I, uh...  I'm admitting this right now.  I am a complete bandwagon jumper.  From one game.  Nice.  Just yesterday's game.  Nice.  I saw, uh...  Sanchez do a great job.  I saw them beat the Pats.  So now I am a Jet fan. 
[00:33:00]  Well...  And not a Jet fan.  Don't ask me anything about it.  Don't fucking tell me...  I haven't been there for years.  Don't tell me...  I know.  I know this.  I'm just jumping on a bandwagon.  One dummy's gonna call up,  You know, it's too easy to root for him now!  That's why I am...  Well, that's...  That's it.  At least he's being honest about it.  I don't care.  I'm a Jet fan.  I believe Jet Green.  I hate the people that aren't honest about it.  And Sanchez decided to become an NFL quarterback in the second half yesterday.  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  That's it.  He finally decided, you know what?  I think I'm gonna be a fucking NFL quarterback.  Yeah, he was throwing that ball.  We've been waiting, Sanchez.  Jesus.  Where were you?  Thrown it further than five yards.  When they were three, I said, where were you?  Where was I?  Not watching them.  Actually, fucking a chick.  No clue.  Now, J-E-T-S.  Jets, Jets, Jets.  We gotta play the Dolphins next week.  Oh, really?  I had no clue.  Jesus, man.  I thought I could fucking talk a little football with you.  No, no.  I don't know who they're playing. 
[00:34:00]  I'll just be there.  All right.  I'm gonna turn it on, and I'll say,  Oh, the Dolphins.  Let's see how well they do.  Hey, they won.  Great.  Great.  I want to go to a game this year.  I didn't go last year.  No?  No.  How do we get tickets?  Just go early in the season, man.  Do we have to, like, call somebody?  It's so nasty going to fucking middle of the winter.  I am not a middle of the winter football guy.  It's New York.  I don't care.  They get the season in before it really has that bad weather.  Are you kidding?  Remember the XFL when they decided we need to play football in the actual middle of winter? 
[00:34:30]  In the middle of the winter.  Hey, I went to a few games at the Meadowlands, and fuck, just freezing my balls off and bundled  up and everything.  Nothing better.  And then people sit in their chairs, and they're all so bundled up that your arms, like, you  just, you squeak in between two people.  And you're just there with your jackets touching, because you're all puffy?  You're talking about, I mean, my years in Buffalo.  Now, now.  Oh, that's crazy.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  Where they, it's so-  That's crazy.  Where it's so cold, they can't get the ice off your seat.  Yeah.  Imagine that.  Just sitting on your ice seat.  You would have to sit on a block of ice, single degree temperatures with a wind chill.  And I like drinking beer during a game, and you can't drink beer when you're freezing  your fucking ass off like that.  No.  So you gotta go to whiskey.  Well, you gotta, you have to have a flask if you go to the-  A flask?  If you go to the Bills games.  It's nice.  The ICC keeps it cold, though.  In December and January.  But they're brutal.  Yeah.  Brutal.  Ooh. 
[00:35:30]  I remember putting my feet on a block of ice and my fanny on a block of ice.  It was insane.  That's not fun.  It's too fucking cold.  No.  Way worse than what happens here in New York.  When you're just concentrating on how cold you are-  Jersey, whatever.  Instead of the game, I don't think you're having fun.  And I do that if I'm freezing.  Well, why do you think I got the seats?  I was just an overnight jerk making no money.  And all the bigwigs at the radio station got all the fine seats.  I told this story a few times.  But first few games of the year, it's nice.  You're in short sleeves. 
[00:36:00]  Of course.  You're still getting a little sun.  Watching the game.  Beer here!  And all of a sudden, the weather turned and those seats, they're like, fuck that.  We're not going to the game anymore.  So the overnight jerk, like myself, got the seats.  You got the seat.  The cold seat.  The block of ice seat.  Got to sit like a champ.  Didn't matter.  That was four degrees out.  All right.  So you're a Jets fan.  That's good.  Yep.  Brand new Jets fan.  Welcome me aboard, please.  What's going on with the Cowboys, Jimmy?  Cares.  Fuck them.  Are they going to have a rough year?  Fuck them.  Wade Phillips is a twat. 
[00:36:30]  I'm not a fan of...  I think the defense is not that great.  I'm not a Romo fan.  I never was.  I don't think he'll ever win a fucking game that's going to make me truly happy.  So fuck them.  America's team, by the way.  Nah, just I'm annoyed.  Are you?  Yeah, I'm irritated.  But I haven't been watching much sports.  Why are you irritated?  Just because I would love to see them have done well.  But I'm so not really invested anyway.  You're losing interest in football?  I've lost interest in almost every sport. 
[00:37:00]  Almost completely.  Like the Yankees, I kind of came back last year.  I'd like to see them do well this year.  But I'm like, got it done.  Oh, fuck.  All of them go fuck themselves.  You and the ball.  You and the ball in the tundra.  Go fuck yourself.  You ever take off a Saturday to come watch me?  No.  Then why should I?  It's annoying.  A couple have, right?  No.  You've never had a sports guy in your audience?  No!  You're lying.  Maybe they've been there, but they haven't taken a fucking game off.  You're dissing one of our really good friends.  Uh-oh.  Tyson's a buddy of mine, yeah.  Tyson Walter.  Tyson, yeah, but Tyson didn't take time off. 
[00:37:30]  He just came.  Oh, his off-season?  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Getting a fine for taking off from your game because you went to see Jimmy Norton.  That'd be great.  $10,000.  That's an expensive ticket.  I really am a fool.  Millions of fans.  Yeah.  Watch my mediocrity.  What, do they live in Marco Island this coming Thursday, Friday, Saturday?  Who knows?  For the comedy club I'm going to be at in Florida.  Very nice.  Exactly.  I just love football because there's just not a lot of games.  Yeah, everyone is pretty important. 
[00:38:00]  I mean, I love hockey, too, but I think I would love it more if they cut that season down.  Pretty important.  Every fucking week is important, right?  Yeah.  That's why they get so much fucking emotion into it.  But the other side of it, four weeks into the season, your team could be done.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the other side of the whole fucking thing.  But so far, so good.  And I guess Travis is, what, Baltimore there?  Fucking got the Yankees, got the best of the Yankees. 
[00:38:30]  Yesterday, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, baseball's still on?  Yeah, baseball is still being played.  Really?  They nailed Rivera.  And, you know, he's human.  What are you going to do?  But you've got a shitty team, so.  Yeah, but we're getting better.  You get lucky.  We're getting better.  Good luck to you.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  Good luck to you.  Thank you.  Just a bunch of knock-around guys, the Yankees.  Just some lovable schmoes trying to make the best out of it. 
[00:39:00]  They've got to end that baseball season before football starts.  They really do.  It's just overlapping seasons and everything.  It's never going to happen because there's money involved.  They make a lot of money.  There's just too much going on now.  When we were growing up, there wasn't all the social networking and all that crap.  But now it's like, get your baseball season over before football starts.  Is it overload, or is it the point that we can pay attention to so many different things going on at once now that it's not that big a deal?  In the oldie days, you couldn't have two games on at the same fucking time on your television. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, the Mets were on Channel 9 and the Yankees were on Channel 11, and that was it.  You couldn't fucking have any more sports or there'd be no programming on anything.  Now, with all the channels and shit, speaking of baseball, did you see the guy that got impaled by the back?  Oh my God.  It wasn't even that bad, right?  They're making more of it?  No.  They said he had to go to the hospital, and they had to do something to get the fluid or an air pocket that formed in his chest. 
[00:40:00]  Whoa.  Like, it didn't puncture his lung, but when you open up the cavity in your chest and your diaphragm goes to pull down to open your lungs up,  it'll just suck through that hole and your lungs won't open up.  Oh, so he got fucked up.  So, yeah.  I saw him just running off the field, so I figured he was all right.  What happened?  That fucked him up.  A bat fucking broke.  Went flying down the third baseline.  Right into his fucking shoulder, like chest, shoulder thing, under his collarbone. 
[00:40:30]  Tyler Colvin, hospitalized after being impaled with a piece of broken back.  It just looked like it hit him, but it fucking gored him.  Did he set the record for the world's largest splinter?  Splinter?  Yeah, that's a big splinter.  It didn't stick in him, which is good.  That would have been really gross.  It just kind of poked him?  But it bounced off of him.  There goes the bat.  Let me see this.  And he's, wham, it just hit him.  They show it in slow motion.  Right down the third baseline.  But it hit him.  It stuck.  I don't care.  Dude, it went in and came out. 
[00:41:00]  I know, but I thought he ran down the baseline with the thing sticking out of him.  No, he got fucked up.  He actually touched the plate, though.  Of course.  Got the run.  Of course, because that's way more important than your life.  Then they put a towel on his shoulder and took him down.  The dugout was very concerned.  You could see the guys were a little shaken by it.  Except for the guy that would take his place.  I bet you he was on the edge of his seat.  Probably was.  Get to play.  He gets to spin around in the outfield or something.  All right.  That's what I would do.  That's what Jimmy does. 
[00:41:30]  Someone told me that Kevin Smith was in a car and he was going to be here before six.  Not before six.  He's plane landed at 545.  But he might have had to shit.  Yeah, that's fine.  Or he might have hit dust in traffic.  I just got the wrong information.  But Kevin Smith's going to be doing most of the radio show with us today.  So why don't we take a break and eat?  He's probably shitting.  Set up for Kevin Smith.  He shits a lot.  Well, he flew all night and then he wants to come in here.  He's crazy.  He just loves to shit.  Look at him.  He's getting, like, his legs start.  They've shown him being walked into the dugout and into the back.  And his legs are getting a little shaky.  How far in did the bat go? 
[00:42:00]  Far enough in where it punctured the cavity.  And how many people are at the game?  Did you see that crowd shot?  There was nobody there.  Did that suck when you get impaled in front of nobody?  For what?  For what?  Oh, of course it was in Florida.  Wow, Florida just doesn't give a shit about their baseball, man.  They really don't.  Oh, my God.  It's amazing.  There's just other things to do.  Jet ski.  Yeah, it's just nice out.  Beach volleyball.  Go down and go fishing.  Look at hot girls in Miami. 
[00:42:30]  There's a million things to do.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  There's no one there.  Wasted seats.  Wow.  There is absolutely no one there.  It's going to look like my show is this weekend.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  Just a sweet boy with a bat in his chest and nobody behind him.  Wow, look at that.  That is a lot of empty seats.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, baseball is over.  Except for like four or five cities.  Yeah.  When's the season over?  Done.  I don't know. 
[00:43:00]  October.  October.  I couldn't even name you the starting lineup for the Mets, and I used to be a huge Mets fan.  Ed Cranepool?  I have just given up on the Mets.  Ed Cranepool.  Giving up Odeca.  Ed Cranepool.  Ed's going back a ways.  I remember having his baseball card.  I think I'm like two, three weeks out from hockey, though.  Are you kidding?  Didn't they just finish?  I think two weeks from Saturday.  Is that about right?  Something like that.  Yeah, preseason starts this week.  Yeah.  Two weeks from Saturday, I believe. 
[00:43:30]  20,000 at the Cubs game stadium.  Just under three weeks.  20,000 plus.  No.  See, they pumped that number.  Yeah, you'd think they pumped it up.  20,000 meaning maybe 12 were there.  Maybe.  Because they count all the tickets that were sold, but people didn't actually go to the game.  Maybe, yeah.  There's no way there's 20,000.  No, it looks like 10.  Tops.  Oh, man.  There's no one there.  Come on.  Get a grip.  All right.  Want a break?  Yeah, I just got my sandwich.  I'm going to eat.  Oh, Lindsay Lohan. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, God love her.  Hope she's okay.  God love her.  She's taking advantage of the...  She's taking advantage of the...  Of all of us.  Yeah.  Well, of...  Yeah.  Huh.  She's not taking this thing seriously.  Did you really think when she went into rehab that she was going to be successful?  I believe in her, aunt.  She wanted...  Yeah, you do?  I do.  I believe in her sincerity.  Because you know when it's court appointed that it's really going to work.  Absolutely.  And you really want it for yourself.  Yeah, she's full of shit.  Yeah.  I got paid.  She deserves everything that she gets. 
[00:44:30]  Millions?  Stupid.  Stupid.  Bitch.  Yeah, I was trying to come up with a good word.  Whore was too easy.  Bitch.  Red-headed twat.  What would you go with, Jimmy?  Stupid head?  Stupid head.  I like that.  And you're a stupid head.  I don't mean to be so harsh, but you know me.  I go right for the throat.  Don't get on my bad side.  I used the term dunderheads yesterday.  Dunderhead.  That's a good one.  I was calling the Pats fans dunderheads.  They were dunderheads. 
[00:45:00]  Shouterheads are a good one, too.  Shout-ah-heads.  Someone actually tweeted back, how old are you?  Dunderhead.  That's what they call the Kaiser.  Right.  Stupid dunderheads.  All right.  I think Kevin Smith will join us next.  Maybe not.  I don't know.  But he'll be here soon enough.  Stay there.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B.  Anthony. 
[00:45:30]  Our pal Kevin Smith in studio.  Good morning.  Good morning, Kevin.  How are you guys?  Good.  I hope you weren't reading your Twitter.  No.  What was that?  Well, we were wondering why you weren't here.  Well, we got the wrong info.  Okay.  People said...  Were you guys turning on me?  No, no, no, no.  Someone said, as I'm sitting here at about 545, Kevin's already in a car. 
[00:46:00]  He's going to be here probably before the show starts.  Obviously wrong info.  Whatever.  So then Jimmy was speculating why you might have been late.  I just said that maybe you were shitting because you shit a lot.  So what?  I do.  I'm a big shitter, man.  We were...  I just came last night.  Go through it.  I love it.  I came from...  Where was I last?  It's been a blur.  I was at Los Angeles like at 930 last night.  We did a show.  I got a theater there now based on Smodcast.  A little theater called Smodcastle.  So we do two shows on Sunday usually. 
[00:46:30]  Jay and Silent Bob get old where we sit around with Muse and he just talks about all of his  drug dependence years and whatnot.  Funny, heartbreaking stories about that.  And then after that, I normally do a show with my friend Malcolm called Blowhard, but  I had to catch the flight to kind of get here.  So I'm still...  I woke up and I was still kind of in the mindset of speaking.  And last night when I was speaking, Muse revealed that during his heroin addiction  days, he would only shit once a week and it would be like a softball-sized bloody stool. 
[00:47:00]  Once every week.  And I was sitting there on stage just going like, I shit eight times a day.  That would be hell to me if I couldn't fucking...  Can you imagine?  It's better than shitting.  It's just socially, it's just great to do.  Yes.  Yes.  It gets you out of so many jams.  Like, I'm sorry.  I gotta go take a shit.  Take it off.  Can I ask Kevin then?  Where?  Well, do you shit outside?  Oh, Jesus.  Or have you ever shit outside?  Camping?  The only time I ever shit outside, it wasn't...  I wouldn't call it outside. 
[00:47:30]  It was inside outside.  But it was in a house where the place had been shut down and the plumbing was off.  I had to take a shit so badly.  Can't shit in the toilet because it's all completely bare.  So we were cleaning out this.  It was so...  Even the circumstances were strange.  My mom worked for this company called C.T. Peters.  They appraised the contents of people's homes after they died and then they hold a big garage sale.  So they had already done that in this house and it was pretty much all empty.  Everything that was of any value, so to speak. 
[00:48:00]  It was gone.  Not sentimental value because the place was fucking packed with this woman's life and her family and whatnot.  And my job, my friend Brian Johnson, was just to dump it all into a fucking dumpster.  It was so sad, dude.  It was sad.  Like, we found pictures that were like, you're looking on the back, taking 1920 something, and they list all the names.  It says a good time was had by a woman.  Oh, was it?  So, so bad.  Did she have any friends that could give that to her?  That was it.  They said no.  There was nobody.  How do they have cut this woman?  And the children, too. 
[00:48:30]  Like, you'd imagine she'd have a kid or two who would want something.  But I guess they took the monetary value and just left it.  We shouldn't take our lives seriously then, you know.  We can't.  Because at the end of the day, some fat piece of shit is throwing your cool shit away, you know.  Because they don't have room in their apartment.  That's that fucking movie.  About Schmidt.  About Schmidt.  It's one of our favorite movies of all time because it certainly is a black comedy, but most people don't see it that way.  I howled during that movie.  When he, all of his work that he wanted to pass on to this new young buck that was coming in, he'd been there for years, and it's just his shit ends up in the dumpster in the back. 
[00:49:00]  Totally.  It's like, there's your life, motherfucker.  My favorite moment in that flick, though, is when he was sitting down pissing because his wife had made him for years and years and years.  And then when she dies, he finally stands and pisses and pisses on the fucker.  Stands up and takes a piss like a man.  People were crying in the theater, and I'm howling.  All right.  I'm like, I see what they're doing with this movie.  I see his childhood home, and it's a tired job.  And he's trying to explain where his bed used to be, and it's a radio display.  It's awesome. 
[00:49:30]  His whole life was who gives a fuck.  Nobody cared about anything he had done or accomplished.  And that's why it's important to make friends and make an impact in people's lives, because at the end of the day, somebody just throws your shit out.  Throws your shit away.  At least you want a friend throwing your shit out.  A friend wouldn't do that.  A friend would be like, I'm going to keep all this shit, because he was a married guy.  Make friends and make an impact.  That's what it says on Gacy's Headstone.  When my dad died, we had a dumpster in the front of the house, and all this stuff that was really important to him, we just looked at it like it's not important to us.  Isn't that amazing, man? 
[00:50:00]  I mean, everything, he's probably a pack rat his whole life, saved all this stuff.  He was close to a pack rat.  I mean, we obviously took stuff that was important to us, but all that other stuff that obviously was only important to him.  You can't save everything.  Sorry, pops.  You know, like you said, some things just aren't important.  You can if you get really important in this world, and then they'll national archive your shit.  Everything is good.  That's what I'm aiming for.  That's what you want.  National archive.  So you shit in this house, but where?  I'm in this house.  We're emptying the contents.  My friend was like, I'm going to go to 7-Eleven and get some Gatorade.  I think his Snapple was huge at the time, so he went to grab some Snapples. 
[00:50:30]  I had to take a crapple.  Couldn't do it in the bathroom.  Found a towel.  Spread it out.  Took a dump on the towel.  Closed it over.  Waited for my friend to come back.  And then he was just like, you didn't get much done.  I was just like, there's just that over there that has to be thrown out.  And he goes again, he's like, oh, what the hell?  And I was like, I took a shit, dude.  And he was horrified.  It wasn't like we didn't have a good laugh.  Like, oh, that was great.  He was just like, why would you do that?  Made me feel so guilty. 
[00:51:00]  I was like, I'll never poop again.  Made me feel shame for shitting.  On job sites when I was in construction, you learned never to open a closed spackle bucket.  Because that's where they do?  Usually in a closet somewhere or down in the basement in a corner.  Some people would be like, oh, I could use a spackle bucket.  I need to mix something up.  A quick thing of sacrete or something.  And you pry that lid open and just a big, nasty dump.  Because those things were used as toilets.  Right.  That was it. 
[00:51:30]  And that was only by the civilized people.  The uncivilized people just leaned in the corner and shit on fire.  We came back from the strip club one day.  It was one of those long Friday lunches.  And the cement guys, who are savages, the concrete fucking guys, I think they're all Portuguese or something, used a four-foot folding ladder, an A-frame ladder, leaned it on its side, sat on it, and took a shit.  That's brilliant.  But all over the ladder. 
[00:52:00]  What was the ladder meant to be?  A makeshift kind of.  Like a square toilet, probably.  Like a square toilet.  Yeah, like he sat down, sat on where the edge was, kind of by the top of the ladder, if it wasn't laying down, and used that little V to put his ass in.  But his shit got all over the ladder.  And it wasn't my ladder.  It was the guy I was, his helper.  Right.  And he was always, he pissed.  You ever go in a stall and you see, like, crap on the wall?  Like, how did it get there?  Yeah, I always wonder how.  People write their names on the wall.  There was a restaurant in our town called Careless Navigator, and there was a girl, apparently, who had went in the bathroom. 
[00:52:30]  A friend of mine followed her, and when she came out, she was just like, I'm pretty sure she wrote her name and shit on the wall.  And I was like, dude, what?  Well, that sounds like a guy thing.  What girl would do that?  I think sometimes it's that out of control, you're pulling your pants down and bent over, and you don't get in.  Whammo.  I always wonder that.  You think there's that much velocity that it's going to fly across and hit the wall?  How would her name wind up in it?  Well, no.  I always think it's something else. 
[00:53:00]  Or it's a very angry person.  Yeah, yeah.  Or they're trying to make friends, make an impact, as I was saying.  I'm starting to think I'm an animal then.  I took a crap outside on the beach during vacation, because I didn't want to walk back to the beach house we were renting.  Right.  How far are we from the beach house?  And where was this?  Five minutes.  Where was this?  Outer Banks, North Carolina.  Great spot.  You're fine.  There was no one on the beach.  Thank you, Kevin Smith.  They don't care in NC, man.  In NC, they're like, go ahead, crap on the beach.  And then I scooped it up, and I threw it in the ocean. 
[00:53:30]  That's perfect.  I recycled.  Yeah, there you go.  And then the birds were feasting.  Yeah.  Disgusting.  See, he's the first one to say it's okay.  I'm all right with that.  I didn't want to walk back to the house.  Well, that's a fat man that's saying that, like, I don't want to walk either.  You know, I hear that.  Oh, I also had my car right next to me, because, you know, it's a four-by-four.  So I could have taken the ride.  Why not just go in the ocean and shit?  Yeah, I don't know.  Because I just had sweatpants on.  So then I would have to get naked, and then that would have been even a whole new thing, 
[00:54:00]  I guess.  How humiliating.  It's like a fucking log is hanging half out.  I would think it would be the greatest story you get to tell for the rest of your life.  If you live.  Yeah, you'd live.  You think it's shark repellent?  You would live.  I was shitting in the ocean, man, and all of a sudden I saw a shark circling, but the  brown log stepped in the bay.  It was like a dolphin.  It just bought the shark for me.  And the shark would be telling his friends, I thought it was an eel.  I don't know what happened. 
[00:54:30]  All right, enough about shitting.  No, there was one other quick story.  And I have one.  A job site.  Oh, and then you got one.  Spack a bucket again.  But the job site was full of people.  There was nowhere to go.  There was no private area to go to take a dump.  And I'm sorry, I don't have the prison mentality where I could just take a shit in front of  people.  So I went into my work van and shut the back doors and went in there and then took the  bucket out.  But it doesn't matter because without water, the second that comes out of you, it is permeating 
[00:55:00]  every inch wherever you are.  What are you, an alien?  You got to explain this to us?  No, I know.  Spoon feeding.  But even after I left the doors open, when we went to leave the job, and it was hours  later, the guy got into the van and was just like, oh my God, what the fuck?  It smells like shit.  I'm just amazed by the aroma of shit can just linger so long. 
[00:55:30]  It stays around like weed.  It just kind of lingers.  I was checking in the hotel.  I just literally checked in the hotel before I came here.  And at the front desk, they were like, hey, there's a weird smell coming from your room.  Can we deal with it?  And I was like, you know what?  I just want to put my shit down and go.  Don't worry about the weird smell.  Got in the elevator and I smelled weed.  So I was like, that's the weird smell.  I can deal with that weird smell.  Then I got into the room.  That wasn't the weird smell.  Somebody had put a fish somewhere and just forgot about it.  Someone was mad.  Oh, it fucking reeks in that room. 
[00:56:00]  I had to open the window to smell New York, which smelled better than the room.  Why would you get in the room?  I would have been such a bitch about that.  I'm so tired.  I'm so not that guy.  I can't be the guy that's like complaining.  After the Southwest thing, I can't complain about anything ever again.  And the nice thing is everyone's super nice because whenever you go someplace, now they're  like, treat him nicer.  He's going to fucking tweet about you.  So I don't get hassled that much.  But still, something like this.  I'm like, it's all right.  Like when Jay Moore said he does at the hotels, he like shits in the bathtub, pisses all over, 
[00:56:30]  just leaves the place a wreck and then puts Telemundo on.  Maybe there's a dead hooker under your bed or something.  It's fucking fantastic.  I don't know, man.  You sure it's a fish?  I don't even know.  That's what it reeks like.  It reeks like somebody left old food there.  It would be your luck that it's a severed head or something.  I'd be fine with a dead animal.  I'd talk about that for, I'd eat out on that story.  It's probably a dead rat or a dead mouse.  You think so?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:57:00]  That's that rotting animal smell.  Some people get angry at the service and they'll stash some food somewhere.  Maybe Luca Brazzi stayed there before you.  I'm like Kevin, though.  I don't complain either.  It's got to be really bad.  I'm fucking...  My wife will complain at the drop of a fucking head.  I can't be...  I just like...  No way.  I'm not one of those like, I deserve better.  I'm like, I can't even believe I'm getting this.  So I'm okay with this.  You should show them your Twitter followers and say, if this isn't fake by the time I  get back, I'm going to fucking ruin your business.  I'm the worst. 
[00:57:30]  I'm the worst.  Are you the worst?  Yeah, man.  You don't want fucking dirty smell.  I can't be bothered.  I just...  I don't know.  Whatever.  Well, you don't want...  Dirty smell.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Did you have a shit story?  You said you had one after anything.  Hey, what about your shit story?  Okay.  By the time I shit on a Pepperidge...  I shit on Peepa's Pepperidge Farm White and I put like a little thing into it, like  a little...  Hors d'oeuvre?  Yeah, like an hors d'oeuvre toothpick.  And I said to my friend Bill D'Angelo, I'm like, here, look, I got a sandwich.  And then he looked at it.  He's like, ah, dude, it's shit.  And then I put it in the street and a car ran it over. 
[00:58:00]  Why is that funny?  Because it was last week.  That needs to be a children's book.  Jimmy's Pooh.  It is, but I screwed up, I called it the shit sandwich, hit the car ran over, and they're  like, you're giving away too much.  The shit was probably better than that awful Pepperidge Farm bread.  Oh, you know how crumbly it is, too.  Eat that stuff.  My grandmother would keep it in the fridge.  Only grandmas have that laying around the house.  You can't make a sandwich out of it, you can't fold it.  Because it's crumbling like they are.  And it just keeps breaking the ball.  It also had, like, two different wrappers on it.  Like, I like my bread, like, wonder. 
[00:58:30]  One wrapper, that's it.  I'd reach in, I'm done.  There, it was like, open the wrapper.  Plastic and the paper.  Then there was another wrapper.  Yes.  Keeping me from the brats.  One more question for Kevin.  We'll get the disgusting stuff out of the way.  Because I reckon, Kentucky, it's a good idea.  You need to ask every guest if they jerk off when driving.  Because we had that discussion last week, too.  I don't think I've ever.  And who doesn't do it?  Who doesn't what?  Jerk off while driving.  I never did.  You did, though.  I've done it.  Oh, you weren't here.  But I have done it once or twice in my life.  Never. 
[00:59:00]  Once or twice in my life, I have.  I had to drive back and forth to Buffalo, man.  Why not?  Drive and jerk?  Yeah, why not?  There's just too much shit to concentrate on.  Yeah, really.  It never occurred to me.  Even a blowjob is a...  That's a little rough.  That's rough.  That's a whole other fucking thing.  Bang your head on the wheel.  I start hitting the pedals like baby legs.  Just kicking.  I can't fucking...  Break gas.  Break gas.  It never occurred to me to jerk off on the road.  You don't drive a lot then, I'm telling you. 
[00:59:30]  I drive a ton.  You do, huh?  Yeah, but I just...  I don't know.  That seems like a lot to balance.  You're doing both things half-assed, I think.  Kind of.  You're not driving well, and you're not jerking well.  But if you're in a car and you lose all the radio stations, it's before satellite, then  you're like, oh, what else can I do?  It's like radio or jerk off.  Come on.  Can't listen to fucking Skinner anymore.  Quite a jump for you and there's nothing else.  And your mind starts wandering.  I saw one time, I was probably 18, I picked up a hitchhiker.  And I remember she wanted me to buy her liquor. 
[01:00:00]  So I bought her beer and I drove her home.  It's like a Lifetime movie.  She was rubbing my leg.  And I was so overcome with lust.  But then she just left.  Like, she wouldn't do anything with me.  She rubbed my leg a little bit.  And then she's like, no, I can't.  I'm married.  And she took the beer I bought her and left.  And that time, I actually did jerk off while I was driving.  I was so out of my mind.  And then I saw my friend Dean.  And I put my dick away and just talked to Dean.  I love your story.  That's what happened.  I saw Dean and that was the end of my fucking jacking off.  I fucking love your stories.  You're silly. 
[01:00:30]  I don't know.  In order to get a...  Sometimes you just do have to get what Opie likes to call the poison out.  You gotta get the poison out.  But, I don't know.  Jerking is...  You gotta...  I haven't jerked since I got a fleshlight.  I haven't jerked it.  Yeah, the fleshlight.  You have one?  Yeah.  I got a few.  I like variety, Jane.  He's like Sinatra with cigarettes.  He leaves them all around the house.  Danny gave it a thumbs up, too.  Yeah, it's pretty astounding.  I mean, I don't even know how else to describe it. 
[01:01:00]  I'm all about it now.  You almost sit there sometimes going, like, okay, real sex or fleshlight sex?  Real sex is gonna take, like, a back rub and, like, you start laying the groundwork.  Fleshlight a minute out in three.  And it's amazing.  I wish Kevin was just joking about that.  It's fucking true.  So, it feels amazing.  Unlike, like, all these years we've been jerking off where it's like, yeah, it's alright.  That is true.  Jerking off is truly getting the poison out.  The fleshlight, though, is a fucking vacation. 
[01:01:30]  It's a staycation.  You just want to sit there and use it and use it again.  Isn't it crazy?  What is it?  Like a sleeve?  They really come around with that rubber.  Oh, it's amazing.  Texture inside feels pretty astounding and it's ridged and ribbed for his pleasure.  Yeah, easy to clean.  It's not that bad.  Do you put it in the dishwasher?  No, you stick one end on the faucet, turn it on, just blows it out the other end, man.  It shits out your cum, as I say.  It's very, very easy to clean. 
[01:02:00]  I'm telling you, but you've got to clean it.  The weird thing is if you don't clean it, like, sometimes, I don't know if you've done  this, I get lazy, I'll do it, and then I find it's freakish.  Once you open the door a little bit, I've never been like this before.  Now I tag it two, three times in a sitting.  So, I finish and I'm like, alright, now I'm smoking a joint to come down, and then all  of a sudden I'm like, you know what, I could probably do it again.  But if you don't clean it, like, I let two, three days go by, and what comes out of you 
[01:02:30]  looking white turns brown or black.  Like, they've all died.  Like, it looks like the battlefields and gone with the wind.  All these corpses.  Fucking Jonestown.  Where's your wife with this?  Oh, damn.  She has a real kind of don't ask, don't tell kind of thing.  Her philosophy is like, I've had a vibrator for years, you never seem to care.  And I was like, you're absolutely right.  Yeah, there you go.  So, it kind of goes both ways.  You feel creepy cleaning up after a, just, a regular jerk is a regular jerk, but the second 
[01:03:00]  you start bringing props in and other things, when you're done, it's amazing a man's mindset,  like you're all in, you're just, this is great, it fucking feels fantastic, you shoot,  and you're like, I am a creep, this feels awful and awkward, now I gotta clean this up.  And, you ever pass by a mirror and not want to look at yourself in the mirror?  Even when I'm not jerking off.  It's just the shame of what you just did and you're cleaning. 
[01:03:30]  This don't have that though, man.  This, it hides your shame.  It hides the shame.  Because you're depositing it into this thing and then you cap it and forget about it.  It's more like, it feels, it's so good, you don't give a fuck.  Wow.  That's a good point.  I have got to try one of these.  Do you jerk it or fuck it?  You fuck it.  But, you know what?  You kind of, I guess it's a combo of both.  Can we see a picture of it?  Yeah.  It looks like a giant prop flashlight.  Danny's pulling out his phone.  That Scooby-Doo would tear it out.  He's not even taking it out.  Put it on the web. 
[01:04:00]  I'm going to get hard if I pull up a picture.  He's like, there's my lady.  Here's my chick.  It's pretty ingenious, dude.  I don't know why I waited so long.  I used to be one of those people who'd be like, who would fuck that?  I would fuck that a lot.  That looks inviting.  It's tanking.  And they've got different orifices.  One looks like a mouth, one looks like a vag, one looks like an ass.  You know what?  It brings back childhood memory because it looks like Hubba Bubba.  Oh, that one's a Raven Riley version.  Yeah, they actually, they do, what do they do?  Very Hubba Bubba look to it.  Porn stars, yeah. 
[01:04:30]  There's a bunch of different.  They model porn stars, pussies, that one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is like, why bother?  There's one that is so blank, so personality-less, it looks like a coin slot.  Oh, that one right there.  That ain't even it, dude.  That looks like lips.  There's the coin slot.  The original stealth.  Wow.  Look at that.  They're not even trying.  That's crazy.  They're not even putting on the pretense of, like, this could be a vagina.  They're like, it's just a fucking slit.  Fuck it.  That's called the Jackie Chan eye.  Oh, God. 
[01:05:00]  That's pretty bad.  And then they've got lips and then a little asshole.  Yeah.  Honestly, the shit on the surface, don't even think about that.  That's just bells and whistles to drag you in.  It's what's inside, as always.  What's inside is what counts.  That is just the facade, ladies and gentlemen.  If we drive around back, you'll notice the Beaver Cleaver house is just a facade.  That always depressed me, though.  I wanted to think it was a real house.  The Universal Tour, when they take you around the back and go like, aw, come on.  Yeah.  Put me out.  The Psycho House.  The Psycho House is all small. 
[01:05:30]  It's four foot high.  Ah, terrible.  I want to think it's a big house.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Well, it's more than four feet, but it's...  It's just small.  They wanted it to look far away and big up on the hill.  The Psycho House is about three-quarter size.  Yeah, three-quarter size.  So you're there, and you're like...  The little tram goes right next to it, and you're like...  Seems strange.  Oh, yeah.  I was on the steps of that house.  Like, when we were doing post on Mallrats, we were cutting the movie.  We used to take our little golf carts and follow the tram around the tour.  So there was a chick who'd been in our movie.  Joey Adams was shooting another movie, Biodome, on the Universal set. 
[01:06:00]  So we would go up to visit her, and they were kind of stationed.  They built the Biodome near the Psycho House.  So we were hanging out there one day, and my friend Malcolm Ingram was interviewing.  And we'd been friends.  She'd been in Mallrats, but that was kind of it.  And then he was like, let's do the interview in Vegas.  We're on the Psycho Steps when this is happening.  He's like, let's do the interview in Vegas.  And I was just like, oh, I've never been to Vegas.  It was back in 95.  And she was like, yeah, when we're there, Kevin and I could get married.  And rather than treat it like a joke, I treated it like a fat kid. 
[01:06:30]  Where I was just like, we could totally get married, couldn't we?  And she's like, Kevin, I was just kidding.  And I was like, no, no.  I mean, wouldn't that be cool if we got married?  Like, we like each other, but not like...  She's like, we haven't even kissed.  I was like, that's what we'd be cool about.  It was the stupidest idea I've ever had in my life.  But I pursued it doggedly to the end.  And she was finally like, you know what?  All right, we'll do it.  We'll go to Vegas.  We'll get married tonight.  I was like, all right.  Five o'clock came.  Nobody picked me up.  Two days later, she finally talked to me.  She was like, that was a little much, Kevin.  I don't want to get married.  I mean, we haven't even really dated. 
[01:07:00]  Let's find out what we think about each other.  I was like, okay.  And then we did wind up dating for like two years.  Damn.  A lot.  That's cool then.  But the second house, for me, will always fucking represent like that moment where I was  like, yeah, let's get married.  And it was embarrassing in retrospect.  Because it was, yeah, it was like, clearly I got way too into the idea.  And she was like, it was a fucking joke, you loser.  Did you hear from the window, she's a whore, Kevin.  She's a whore, Kevin.  Kevin, leave her alone.  Leave her, Kevin. 
[01:07:30]  Bring her up here, Kevin.  Hey, yeah, we got to take this phone call.  There's a woman that does the drive jerk.  Rachel, DC.  Rachel.  Hey, boy.  Yeah, man, I admitted that I do a little jerking on the road every once in a while.  Not in many years, though, because I don't do the long drives anymore.  Well, I first did it when I was driving cross-country.  I was moving from Philly to California to go to grad school.  And driving by myself in a Miata gets pretty boring after a while. 
[01:08:00]  So I actually first started doing it just to keep myself awake.  Then I realized, of course, that...  You had to roll the window down, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, that didn't work.  And, I mean, I'm, you know, almost losing control of the car.  Like, I'm riding the clutch.  I mean, it's a whole big thing.  Don't realize that there's truckers, even SUVs going by me that can see into my little car and see exactly what happens. 
[01:08:30]  How do you not realize that?  You're in a Miata.  Exactly.  And if you could see their face looking at you.  Because she was on a sensual journey of self-exploration.  Yeah, she didn't care.  Yeah, self-exploration.  Yeah, exactly.  And I drove across country in three days, so I was on, like, no sleep.  There's been times where I've wanted to jerk off, like when I pull up to the GW and I see no line at the toll.  Then I kind of want to as a celebration.  Well, see, for us, I don't know that either.  Yeah.  Chicks have it so much easier, though.  If I was a chick, I'd be jerking off everywhere. 
[01:09:00]  Because you can hide it.  I do it in D.C., too, because if you're stuck in, you know, beltway traffic down here, if you know anything about it, it takes you, you know, two hours to go six miles.  Is it just to stay awake or do something, or are you actually, like, getting off every time?  Oh, well, I first did it when I drove across country to stay awake, and then I was like, ooh, that's pretty good.  No, now it's sort of passing the time, but I really enjoy it.  Do you remember what state you came in? 
[01:09:30]  I think, I think I first did it in Iowa, maybe.  Nice.  Ah, great state.  Nice.  Yeah.  You are in Iowa.  Just put a corn cob up her ass and fucking check.  Nice.  And I think, I grew about 80, so I think I hit Nevada.  Nice.  While, I mean, it got to the point where I was doing, in every state.  And when I reached California, I made sure I didn't want that. 
[01:10:00]  They just have pictures of her masturbating in front of Mount Rushmore and fucking Devil's Tower.  No.  Just jacking it.  Now, here's the question.  You go across the country.  How many states do you think you could come in?  Kev?  How many states?  How many states?  Well, I mean, if I was seriously.  You guys start from the East Coast.  With the flesh, you're in trouble.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I've done that.  I've done the coast to coast.  I don't jerk off in the car, but I own a bus now.  A tour bus? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  After the Southwest thing, I had a bunch of tour gigs to do, a bunch of the Q&A things.  And I didn't want to fucking fly anymore.  I didn't want to go near an airport.  So I started renting Rockstar tour buses.  First time I called the dude up, called one of the places, because I was like, I wonder  if you can do that sort of thing.  Called up, and I was like, yeah, I was interested in renting a bus.  And the dude's like, how many people in the band?  I was like, just me.  And he was like, oh, you that Too Fat to Fly guy?  And I was like, yeah, yeah.  He's like, totally.  So I rented a bus, I think it was three times from this company, Coast to Coast it was called. 
[01:11:00]  And then I kind of fell in love with it, and I went and bought a used bus.  How cool is that?  And it actually enabled us to drive.  This guy, Clovis, who's a friend of mine who's a driver.  Clean guy?  No, he's filthy.  Of course he's filthy.  No, I mean, like, you know.  Yeah, he don't do any of that stuff.  Okay, no, that would be my fucking nightmare.  He's the straight laces for it.  That I picked the wrong driver as I'm snoozing in the back.  This guy's doing all sorts of shit and driving.  Utterly trustworthy and just happy to be driving and whatnot.  And happy that it's like not a packed bus full of people, you know what I'm saying? 
[01:11:30]  In the beginning, he was one of the drivers I had when I was just renting.  And I'd be in the back, and I'd smoke, and I'd put, like, pillows against the back door.  And I'd really try to build up a barrier so the smoke didn't travel.  But smoke in a tube, it's going to fucking travel.  So Clovis, at one point, we'd stop for gas or something.  And he was just like, he was saying, okay, we're going to go another 200 miles and break for it.  So I was like, right on.  And he goes to leave, and he stops.  He comes back.  He goes, Kevin, I just want to let you know, like, you could feel free to smoke back. 
[01:12:00]  You don't have to worry about it.  I said, oh, you know, I'm afraid that it'll come up there and hit you.  He goes, Kevin, I've driven Jimmy Cliff and Snoop Dogg.  He's like, you're just one man.  I was like, right on, right on.  That's easy.  So on the bus, I've got the flashlight in there because generally it's three days to get across the country.  Right.  And I'm tagging that thing left and right.  So I've come in many states on the road but never driving myself.  You love it or what?  I love it so much.  Do you guys stop at cool places?  We do, totally.  All right. 
[01:12:30]  And we also, and you know what's really nice about it?  You're in the back, and you've got the curtains down and whatnot, shades down.  You open them up, you look out the window, you're like, Indiana.  Close it, jerk off, open the window.  Chicago.  You know, it's just every time you open it, it's nice.  It's fairly sweet, though.  I gave it to my in-laws, Jen's parents, my wife's parents, to take to where they go to Grand Canyon.  And they went with two old friends, and there's like a bunch of 60-year-olds in this bus getting really loaded going all these.  So somebody said, is this a flashlight?  Somebody was like, we're working. 
[01:13:00]  They unscrewed it, looked in the front like fucking Elmer Fudd and shit.  They got hit with a bunch of black cum.  And the neighbor's wife lifted it up to the lights and looked out.  You must have pimped out this bus, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's on the bus?  Oh, did I pimp?  I thought you said pimped out.  No, pimped it out.  No, not at all.  The bus was pretty nice to begin with.  Yeah.  I didn't do too much to it.  In the back just recently, I had a table put in, so I could kind of sit in the back and write.  There was a table up front, but I wanted one right next to the bed.  And it's pretty cool, man. 
[01:13:30]  It's like, you know, I mean, it's not really economically friendly in as much as you're using a lot of gas to get one guy around the country.  But I don't know what to do.  I'm not flying, you know, so I wasn't.  Are you still not flying at all?  I flew in here tonight, though.  So last night I flew.  But generally, there was a long stretch where I wasn't.  And if I have a preference, I'd always rather take the bus.  I couldn't take the bus this time because I had to come out to do the breakfast club thing tonight, see you guys.  They're not going to get back because tomorrow we start shooting Red State. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, right on.  Yeah, it's a pretty fucking tight schedule.  Could you imagine you had to fucking fly if you went and the first time back into a plane, they gave you shit?  I was on.  Nobody gave me shit, but I was on an Air Canada flight, and my wife was with me.  And we'd just come off this cruise, and it was kind of the first time I was going to fly.  And in order to get to where I had to go, I didn't have enough time to do the drive thing.  So I had to go like, all right, I'll concede to the flight.  Like, we get on this flight, dude.  I literally sit down, and the guy next to me goes, hey, they're going to throw you off this plane? 
[01:14:30]  And Jen's just like, I'll switch seats with you.  Yeah, yeah, thanks.  Yeah, great.  That guy.  But generally, it's been fine.  But yeah, in the airport now, people double take.  They're like, you're not supposed to be here.  You're too fat for here.  Oh, fuck.  I don't want to be known as that guy.  I'll take it.  I'm all right with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the week that it happened, I was so fucking like, how does one live after this?  But three days later, man, what's his name?  Tiger Woods came out and was like, I'm so sorry. 
[01:15:00]  And suddenly, nobody gave a shit.  Right.  Wow.  I didn't even realize that.  Yeah.  Same time.  I'll always owe that dude a debt of gratitude.  It was three bad days.  And then all of a sudden, everyone was on to him.  I was like, yeah, isn't that horrible what he did?  Look at him.  Casting those stones.  Exactly.  But the bus is cool.  You guys are well.  I'm serious.  If you guys want to use it, let me know.  I would love.  It's a cool thing.  I mean, I'm not saying you got to use it together, but if like you go out.  Someday, I would love to go cross country and some kind of bus like that.  It rocks, dude.  It is so cool.  And you pack it with, you know, food because you got a full kitchen in there. 
[01:15:30]  You pack.  I got DVDs or TVs.  Damn.  It's just like being in your house.  The beautiful thing about it is I used to sweat traveling so much.  Just like, oh, I got to get packed and got to get ready and the rush to the airport  and go through security and all that stuff.  Thing just pulls up to my house.  I just kind of throw my bags in and we go.  So I'd leave the house whenever I was wearing.  On a long time, right.  Pajamas, robe, just get on the bus, continue doing the same thing.  Do you ever look at the clock, though, like eight hours later and go, fuck, I would have  been there?  Never.  Oh, it doesn't bother you?  Oh, God. 
[01:16:00]  No, because I got weed, Jimmy.  What do I care about getting there?  Time is inconsequential.  Totally.  It creates time and whatnot.  You do a little chilling.  Yeah.  It's nice.  Because it really does let you kind of think, just be alone.  Like, really, generally speaking, I'm by myself on the bus.  So it gives me time to just kind of sit there and think, write, do a bunch of stuff.  But it also creates possibilities.  Like, we took, because of the bus, I started taking the podcast, the Smodcast show, out  into the world and doing it live.  Because I was like, I got this bus, man.  Like, that's what people do with a bus. 
[01:16:30]  So I hit up Mojo.  I was like, you want to start doing it live every place?  He's like, yeah.  And then I brought my other friends, Brian and Walt, to a show called Tell Them Steve,  Dave.  We took them with us live.  So now it's a bus that actually, beyond just taking me from gig to gig, we use it to live  tour with the podcast.  So that's something I never would have done if I hadn't had the bus.  Because it was just by sitting on the bus for two months going like, hey, man, I should  go out on the road, like the fucking Partridge family.  I've got a bus.  You feel like a rock star?  You do.  You kind of feel like a rock star and whatnot. 
[01:17:00]  It was cool.  There was one time.  There was only one time, though.  First time, I think, first time I rented the bus.  I was doing a gig in Austin.  And I got off the stage.  And as I came back to the bus, I saw a young woman getting off the bus.  And I was so wigged out by that, because that ain't my fucking thing at all.  Oh, shit.  And one of the drivers was just like, yeah, man, she was talking about blowjobs.  And I was just like, dude, that's why you don't let her on the bus, if that's the case.  I'm married.  You're married.  Will you fucking let somebody on the bus?  I was weird.  But generally speaking, people leave you alone. 
[01:17:30]  That's nothing but trouble.  You've got a flashlight.  You don't need that.  Yeah, I was like, I don't need you.  I've got rubber.  I've got an adamant rubber and a wife.  I can't wait to see the next version of Fleshlight come out on the box.  It'll just be as endorsed by Kevin Smith.  They were cool.  They jumped on, what was it, about six months ago or more?  The podcast that we do on the website got very expensive because it kept getting, you  know, the more downloads you have, the more it costs. 
[01:18:00]  And so it's a free show for everybody, but for fucking yours truly.  It was costing me deep.  So I looked for a sponsor.  And, you know, finding a sponsor for the shit that we talk about isn't very easy, as you  guys are well aware.  So I reached out to Fleshlight because they had sent me an email after Zach and Mary make  a porno.  And they're like, it was so funny that you shouted us out.  We would love to do a Zach and Mary Fleshlight.  Nothing ever came of it because the wine seed company didn't really pursue it.  But I remember the email and I hit them up and I'm like, do you guys want to sponsor the 
[01:18:30]  podcast?  And they were like, okay.  And we, and it was such unfamiliar terrain.  Like at that time, I really thought like, I'm breaking new grounds.  Nobody's doing it.  It's fucking, it's the same as radio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like basically just recently with like now, now after about six months, more advertisers  are starting to come in.  We were holding them at bay and we were just like, let's not do it.  But now it's happening.  And at that point you, you start looking at it like, oh, it used to just be us sitting  around talking.  Now it's a business kind of thing. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the, the sponsor end of it to me is still, it blows my mind.  And I, whenever I see somebody who's like, yeah, yeah, we'll give you some money to  say something nice about it.  And Fleshlight, I could get behind, literally.  I could get behind it.  It's a product that I can kind of like, yeah, I like this.  I don't think I could just kind of be like, sell anything, but that I could totally speak  passionately about.  The Fleshlight demonstration video is hilarious.  Are they showing how to clean it?  Yes.  Look at the, I mean, who cleans it with a bowl? 
[01:19:30]  They got to show you the real way, which is like you take it to the sink, put one end of  the sink, threw one end, and that's it.  And just bless.  I hope, now how do you clean the end of the sink, though?  That's not my problem.  It's his sink.  You don't care.  Yeah, totally.  I'm not a kid anymore.  It's not like I take drinks out of the sink or anything like that.  And anybody that does, they shouldn't be, and that's their punishment.  Oh, man.  We should announce the Smodcast thing, because you were just talking about it.  Yes.  We're excited, and we're hoping that we'll be here. 
[01:20:00]  I mean, Kevin Smith's Smodcast will be on this fine channel.  On the virus.  Yeah.  Yeah, they finally made a deal with Kevin.  We've been asking for this for, I don't even know how long, but they finally worked it out.  Since it was just XM.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what happened.  We used to run them on the virus, and then they were going to make something a little more  official, and then everything went quiet, because they started talking.  Merging and all that.  So finally, yeah, they picked it up a month and change ago. 
[01:20:30]  Somebody was just like, hey, can we run them here?  Yeah, we're so happy about this.  The Smodcast debuts on the virus Saturday, this Saturday?  Yes.  Okay.  With an original virus-exclusive episode of the show, which is very cool.  Then we're doing a marathon.  Smodcast Marathon will air Sunday from 7 a.m. to midnight, featuring the new show plus episodes  from the archives.  The archive shows are just amazing.  A lot of our fans haven't heard them.  We're up to, I think, 134 episodes.  All totaled, we have 200 different podcasts.  How long are they each? 
[01:21:00]  About an hour.  About 15 minutes to an hour.  Sometimes a little bit longer.  Why do I do four, four and a half hours of radio?  I'm telling you, dude.  That's the thing.  People talk about it going like, oh, it's so clever.  I'm like, you know what?  It's no different than what those fucking dudes do every morning on the radio for four hours,  five days a week.  We do one hour a week.  That's it.  That's awesome.  It's pretty sweet.  Then we've got the Smodcast airing regularly on the virus, Saturdays at 1 p.m. and Sundays  at 5.  They're going to run.  Basically, what they're doing is running what we run on the site.  Then once a month, they have one that we just do for them. 
[01:21:30]  That's awesome.  And that'll be like, Scott and I recorded one already for them, which is actually really  funny.  We figured we'd do a reintroduction of sorts.  So we wound up kind of doing a truncated history and it turned into something pretty  funny episode.  But after that, it'll be stuff like we'll be pulling from the Smodcastle, like some of the  live shows, some of the shows we've done on the road and some of the other shows that  I'm in, that Scott's not necessarily like Jay and Silent Bob get old and blowhard.  And it's cool for us.  It's like, you know, it's just one more place to kind of throw the show so it can be heard. 
[01:22:00]  And, you know, for us, that's kind of what it's all about.  We couldn't be happier, Kevin.  Oh, I'm delighted to be here.  We're very excited.  So there you go.  There's the big announcement from Kevin Smith today.  Very nice.  Me on the virus.  Smodcast on the virus.  Lots and lots of it.  Jesus Christ.  Are you guys going to be here?  Well, we still have a contract past October 1st.  Is that when it left?  This October?  No, this October.  Yeah, we're close.  We're getting there, aren't we?  So what happens?  They're hashing it out. 
[01:22:30]  A lot more Smodcast replaced.  Catch Kevin Smith 6 to 10.30 every morning.  I thought I was augmenting.  I didn't know I was replacing.  You're replacing.  What will happen?  Well, I mean, I would love to say what I want to say, but I'm just trying to keep my mouth shut.  It's frustrating.  They're in negotiations.  They're negotiating.  We'll see what happens.  With you guys or with another party?  Does it have anything to do with the other party who may or may not be sticking around?  I have no idea. 
[01:23:00]  But I don't think so.  We're separate.  Separate company altogether still.  Yeah, separate.  What happened?  We never really talked about it.  It's the same company, but it's like two separate negotiations going on.  It's our agent negotiating.  I mean, I'm not giving away any secrets here.  I don't know what happens after October 1st.  If we have a deal, we're back.  If we don't, I don't know if we continue without a contract or if they just take us off the air.  I don't know.  I'm going to go play golf for a while until they figure it out.  Take the bus, dude.  Take the bus.  Take the bus.  And hockey star.  I'll be fine for a while. 
[01:23:30]  I'll be fine.  It is two separate deals.  They're negotiating dollars with Howard and pennies with us.  Is that going to happen on the other end or do you think he's going away?  Howard, I don't know.  Wow, a lot of loaded questions today.  Well, I think he continues.  Here?  I'm serious?  I think he works even less than he is now.  So you think he's doing three days a week or something?  If I was a betting man, I'd say he goes for like three days a week.  Yeah?  Sure.  Yeah.  Keeps just facing it a little bit. 
[01:24:00]  He loves doing radio.  It's obvious.  Yeah.  But I don't think the company wants to pay the salaries.  Yeah, that's kind of huge.  I don't think they can.  Or they can.  That's fine.  We'll see.  We'll see what happens.  Who fucking knows?  Who knows is right.  But.  All right.  Want to take a break?  Yes.  You need breakfast, Kevin?  Anything?  What do you need?  I did not get breakfast.  I'm good.  I'm totally fine.  You good for now?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  More with Kevin Smith.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Yeah.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:24:30]  I am with Kevin Smith. 
[01:25:00]  I just announced that the Smodcast is coming to the virus, and we're really, really happy about that.  You'll hear all the promos on this channel explaining everything, because there's a lot going on with that.  There'll be instructions.  Yeah.  If you sit tight, there'll be instructions.  Yeah.  And Kevin was telling me, I think we talked about it on the show, that he went to Australia for the Smodcast.  The Opera House.  Well, no, it wasn't with Smod.  That was just me.  That was Q&A.  Oh, the Q&A.  Right, right.  That was cool.  That was a very cool venue.  It was one of those venues that everybody seems to know, too.  I hear there's a lot of different rooms. 
[01:25:30]  I think Jim Jeffries was telling us.  There's the main room.  I did both.  Then there's some side rooms.  There's the theater, and then the opera theater, and the opera hall.  And I wound up doing both.  You sold out one, and the other one wasn't available the next time?  The other one wasn't available, and then they kind of opened it up and whatnot.  So it was definitely cool.  But they're not that different from Canadians.  They're pretty close to Canadians.  Australia?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Australians?  They're just like Canadians that like pussy more.  Like, they're very, you know, they have a zeal for life. 
[01:26:00]  G'day, aye.  You know, they're just very into life and stuff, it would seem.  And fucking and drinking.  They would seem like a cool place to kind of...  Yeah, all the good things.  They seem to be doing it right over there.  And I also felt like, what a great place to be, because who the fuck is going to take terrorism out there?  Yeah, I really do.  You know what I'm saying?  You're too far away to be fucked with.  Everyone's just like, leave them alone.  Yeah.  So it's probably a safe place to live.  They give out very light prison sentences there, too.  I was watching a show about I Escaped from Jail.  Oh, I love that.  I have a lot of stuff.  And they showed the one story of the Australian criminal who broke out. 
[01:26:30]  And what did he get, like, fucking five years?  Five years.  No, with the help of a woman who worked in the prison system.  They shot a cop in the chest and had a shootout with the cops.  He got eight years.  She got five.  I couldn't believe that.  They're still together.  And she really ended up getting out before she did.  Yeah.  Like, because of some weird thing.  They found out the initial crime he was guilty of that he actually broke out for.  They acquitted him of that one.  So all he was in for was breaking out of jail.  Of jail?  Yeah.  The cop that they shot, did he get killed?  No, he lived.  They shot him in the chest. 
[01:27:00]  But then they had a shootout, a half-hour shootout in the woods with other cops.  Did anybody get hurt there?  I don't think so.  How do you have a half-hour shootout and nobody gets shot?  It's amazing.  It was across, like, water.  Yeah, they showed one guy.  There were trees in the way.  He's got, like, an AR-15, and he's in the water, and he's shooting, going through magazine after magazine.  He's just shooting 30-round clips at these people.  He said he saw the flash, the muzzle flash, coming at him out of a bush, and he's just like,  I figured if I just kept shooting at that area, I'd have to hit somebody. 
[01:27:30]  This is after a prison breakout.  He got eight years, and his correctional officer girlfriend, who helped break him out, got five.  That's it?  Five.  Five years.  My God.  By the way, we've got a wise-ass.  How long was the drive to Australia, Kevin?  I couldn't do that.  I wanted to.  I really, really wanted to.  I did, I wanted to chitty-chitty bang bust the fucking, make it fly and shit, but no,  unfortunately, at that, I had to take a plane.  Did you go Qantas?  I didn't.  We went to Virgin Australia.  I had gone Qantas last time I was there. 
[01:28:00]  It was fine.  It was totally good.  Yeah.  You know, it was actually, there was something on that plane that I'd never had before.  We were in these two seats, kind of on the side.  Courteous people.  Yeah.  Number one, there was that.  Nobody was like, you're too fucking fat guy out of here.  I'm like, oh, thanks.  Um, they had a curtain that came over the area where we were sitting.  And so Jen and I, my wife and I were sitting by, uh, two seats on the side by the window.  Then when the flight took off, they would close this privacy curtain.  So you were by yourself.  If I was a younger man, I would have been like, but I think most people do try because 
[01:28:30]  they checked every 15 minutes.  I've never been waited on like this.  They'd be like, can we get you?  And I was like, wow, they're so like service friendly.  And Jen was like, they just want to make sure we're not fucking.  Yeah.  They don't want jizz on their curtains.  That's it, man.  That was it.  You could have asked them not to check on you anymore, though.  So they'd leave us alone for a little while.  And then they'd be like, look.  Yeah, I was like, I need three minutes.  Don't check.  Three minutes in a wet towel.  You in one seat, the fleshlight, and the other.  I like those, uh, those goddamn sleeper seats on planes are great. 
[01:29:00]  They're pretty sweet, man.  I just flew on American.  They had one too.  Yeah.  American.  Now I went to, uh, LA like, I don't know, a couple of weeks ago and sleeper seats.  I can't imagine sitting anymore for a whole flight.  You just lay down, go to sleep.  You wake up.  I call time machine.  You're like, bup, I'm here.  That was great.  It's the next best thing to hypersleep.  That's what we really need is you get on a plane, you're out, and then you wake up.  And then you wake up.  I used to stay up all the time on planes because I was always excited about just being on a plane, looking out. 
[01:29:30]  My whole world was looking out the window.  I feel positively continental.  I'm in the air.  I'm a gentleman of the air.  Ah, yes.  Now, you're also a nervous Nelly, let's not forget.  No, I wasn't so much nervous.  Did you get dressed up to fly?  Like, you put on a suit and shit?  I put on a suit and tie like the other day.  You were petrified to fly when I first met you.  You were scared to fly when I first met you.  No, I hadn't flown in a long, long time, so it was very, like, yeah, there was anxiety there.  There was a little anxiety going on.  But it wasn't like I was, oh, my God, the plane is going to crash.  It was just a whole thing. 
[01:30:00]  There's a lot of shit going on when you fly, you know, especially when I hadn't flown for a long time.  This was, like, back in the fucking 90s.  But then it got to the point where we were flying around a lot doing shit, and I would just have my nose pegged against the window the whole time just looking.  I could not not look out the window.  Like a dog or a four-year-old.  Yeah, yeah.  I just had to look at every little thing on the ground, and then I'd play, like, Bomber Pilot.  You take a scratch on the window, and you line it up with things with one eye on the ground, and I'd go, what's wrong with you?  It's fun.  You were in your 30s. 
[01:30:30]  I know.  Jesus.  You've got to stay young.  And then I realized, look, I could just, then electronic devices came in where I'm like, look, I'm on a plane watching a fucking movie on my computer.  This is great.  And then it just got to the point where it's like, yeah, I'm fucking sleeping.  What am I doing?  Yeah, I'm up in the air.  I've done it before.  Now, the thrill is pretty much out of the whole thing.  Point A to point B kind of guy now.  Just get me there.  I was sleeping.  I finally fell asleep on an American flight coming back.  No, the United flight going out. 
[01:31:00]  And there was open seats because the weather kept people from getting to the plane.  So I'm in midair.  I'm asleep.  And the fucking flight attendant wakes me and goes, we're sorry.  We're going to have to put somebody next to you.  She's sick.  Sick?  So they bring up this little Asian girl from the back.  SARS?  Yeah.  She had a great fucking mask coughing on you.  She had Ebola.  She was just shitting and throwing it all over.  It was a bloodbath.  No, she had fainted.  So she had a fucking oxygen mask.  So they wake me and they fucking sit some girl with an oxygen mask next to me. 
[01:31:30]  And then her friend is there yapping at her in fucking, I don't realize how loud I'm talking voice.  It was horrible.  Can you say no to that situation?  No, because I didn't want to get sick.  But you don't know what she's got.  It was only if she felt dizzy.  It wasn't like she was sick.  She just passed out.  Because she's got the flu.  Yeah.  She's got some kind of plague or something.  Yeah.  I don't want to be a prick.  Right next to you.  Maybe she has MRSA.  Should have been a prick.  What's MRSA?  Oh, God.  What is that now?  It's like a fucking big open infection pustule thing.  It eats its way through your body, basically. 
[01:32:00]  And we thought Fez had it from Ron and Fez because he had a big thing under his arm.  What was it?  A boil?  A boil source?  Yeah.  We're thinking it might be a boil now.  But we've MRSA.  Oh, it's a super bug.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  It sucks.  Oh, I don't even look at those fucking pictures.  You don't want to look at MRSA.  Wow, that's pretty.  How do you stay away from this?  You don't.  You don't go to the hospital.  Is that where you got it?  Yeah.  People get him at hospitals.  He didn't get it.  It's a boil on him.  You get it from an ingrown hair or fucking something.  What, MRSA?  No, no. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, that's what he has.  Yeah.  He doesn't have MRSA.  He's just got fucking infection.  How do we know?  The doctor checked it out.  You had to bring a doctor's note to do radio on Friday.  The doctor squeezed it and jiggled it.  I blame the ingrown hair on anything, man.  Anytime I feel a lump or something, I'm like, ingrown hair.  It's got to be.  It's got to be.  Can't be anything worse than that.  Ingrown hair.  I know it.  It's creepy shit.  I can't look at it.  Danny, come on.  It's so fucking disgusting.  Holes in people.  And it's a bug?  It's like a germ?  No, it's not a nice thing.  Yeah, it's an infection. 
[01:33:00]  It's an infection.  It's some kind of viral infection, though.  Not a bug bug, you know what I mean?  It's very resistant to antibiotics and shit.  It's one of those things that are going to wind up killing the whole human race.  Like some zombies.  What was that movie, man, with Will Smith?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I Am Legend.  I Am Legend.  Yeah, creepy shit.  What was the one?  Omega Man.  Omega Man was the one with Charles Heston.  Damn you.  Chuck Heston.  You should make a movie about Mercer.  People give you shitty movie ideas.  You ought to make a movie about Mercer.  That'd be great. 
[01:33:30]  You should do a movie about that.  Great.  That's like we get, yeah, I hope this don't end up on your show tomorrow.  It's like, do you understand how boring your fucking conversation exactly?  Why the fuck would it end up on the show?  It has nothing to do.  What you say has no value in the world of comedy.  How dare you?  It's like a plumber's over the house talking about running a pipe.  And he's like, yeah, we're going to have to do this.  But we might have to dig out something under the house and stuff.  Hey, I hope this doesn't end up on your show tomorrow.  Or, yeah, yeah, I'm going to talk about a plumber digging a pipe hole. 
[01:34:00]  Listen, shithandler.  As you talk, I just see Z's.  That's what you are.  Fucking row of Z's.  It's like, yeah, Kevin, I got an idea for a movie.  It's great.  I get that quite often.  Do you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm always like, look at the movies I make, dude.  Like, seriously?  Like, what you told me is inventive.  Why would you think I would do that?  Are there any really bad ideas, though?  You've got to have some fucking duds.  No, I just tune out. 
[01:34:30]  People throw at you.  Yeah.  It's like, look, I can't take any unsolicited ideas.  All you have to do is hit them with the kind of like, yeah, no, I can't really.  If you tell me something, look, you can't tell me because if it ends up on the screen,  you know, I'm in trouble.  You keep it to yourself.  And that's true, man.  It's weird.  You're not allowed to.  Well, you're not allowed.  I could, I guess, if I wanted to.  But you're not supposed to read the scripts.  Yeah.  Because that's actionable.  But you can watch somebody's finished movie.  What's the difference?  Yeah.  Like, if you're going to steal, you could steal from the finished movie, too.  Sure you can.  It's a bizarre set of rules, man. 
[01:35:00]  But I never accept scripts.  Yeah.  Because no one offers them.  Allison wants people to know that you can get mercy in the community.  We know that.  I think it starts in hospitals, and then you infect people after you leave or something.  I don't know.  Great.  Good thing Allison called up with her fucking not helpful.  What an unfun person she is.  She wanted to help the show.  She didn't want to help the show.  She was just trying to give sad advice.  Yeah, that was a real reality burst.  Great.  Okay.  You know, I was sitting there going, that's only in hospitals.  As long as I never go there, I'll be fine. 
[01:35:30]  What a dud, Allison.  Allison, you're a buzzkill.  Allison.  What do you do at parties?  Do you give out drunk driving statistics?  Fucking horrible woman.  Well, Allison.  Killjoy, go ahead.  What do you do at parties?  I just wanted people to know that it used to be that you could only get it in the hospitals,  but it is in the community.  It is treatable.  This is another advertisement for the fleshlight. 
[01:36:00]  Exactly.  Is that what it was?  Just her talking.  Yeah.  I would be like, yeah.  Well, you guys get the whooping cough in California.  Who?  There's some whooping cough shit going on.  There's some commercials for whooping cough.  Whooping cough is happening in Hollywood.  There's someone holding a baby, and she's holding the baby.  What is whooping cough?  The kid makes a whooping sound after it coughs.  Is that what it is?  Yeah, they get some kind of bad cough.  So this is a baby disease?  Bad cough.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's a baby disease.  So then it doesn't matter to us.  I give a shit.  I live, I got through the baby years. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, you got through all those.  I ain't never going back.  No, no, that's it.  I survived all my shit.  Now it's their turn.  Some kind of whooping cough thing happened.  I guess Kevin doesn't know about it, so that's good.  Uh-uh.  No.  It's probably people who haven't gotten shots, and something tells me, Southern California,  probably a lot of babies that haven't had the proper medical care coming up from.  Well, because Jenny McCarthy's telling people how bad it is.  Oh, is she?  Oh, yeah, she is.  I thought she was on my plane.  Really?  I thought.  There was a chick in front of me who kind of looked like her, and it was going to be awkward 
[01:37:00]  because she doesn't like me at all.  Why?  She auditioned for Mallrats years ago, and there was nothing happened.  It was just kind of like, you know, she was fine, but I had a different idea in my head.  And the day that she came to audition, I didn't know who she was, but one of the producers,  the older producer guys, was just like, oh, this is a girl from Playboy.  I guess she'd posed in Playboy.  Exactly.  So there have been a few people who came to the audition who hadn't been coming to the 
[01:37:30]  other audition.  So let's say there's three more bodies in that room than normally would have been there.  And me, so young in my career, I couldn't be like, fuck off.  That's just rude.  You just want to stand and stare at a pretty girl.  But, you know, there was a studio, I was like, all right, go ahead, you can stay.  She came in, auditioned, left.  That was it.  After she left, I think there was some chit-chat about, like, she was in Playboy.  Oh, right on.  That was it.  Six months to a year later, I get a call from a fact checker at Details Magazine going,  I would like you to confirm a story that Jenny McCarthy told us. 
[01:38:00]  And I was like, okay.  And so they're doing some cover story on her.  And she said that the Mallrats audition was the worst audition she had ever had in her  life and that it was, she couldn't stand the fact that none of us in the room could  wait until she was gone before we started laughing.  She said the door hadn't even closed as I was leaving and I could hear them all laughing 
[01:38:30]  at me.  Whoa.  Now, I don't know what the fuck she heard.  Maybe she heard laughter in another office.  Nobody, again, it was like with the plumber where it's like, buddy, what the fuck makes  you think?  Laughing.  I'm going to fucking, you know, tell your story.  Same thing.  It was just like, it was an audition.  She didn't crush it.  She didn't blow it.  And she left and we were just like, okay, who's next?  Probably someone farted in the room or something as she was leaving.  Who knows what it was.  But they hit me with that and I was so offended because I'm not that guy.  I go painstakingly out of my way to not let people's feelings get hurt.  I grew up fat.  I know what that's like. 
[01:39:00]  Even people I don't fucking like, I don't go in for like the attack kind of humor.  So at that moment though, I felt totally fucked over.  I felt like you fuck.  That didn't happen.  You're making shit up.  So the dude goes, do you have a comment?  And I said, yeah, I would just like to point out that that is absolutely untrue.  We waited until she was way out in the parking lot before we started laughing at her terrible  audition.  So I let him put that.  He's like, you want to go with that?  I was like, yeah, I do.  And they put that in the article.  And ever since then, she's, I guess, had a real distaste for me. 
[01:39:30]  And she did some movie.  What was it called?  I don't know.  I think Love Sucks or something like that.  And the commentary track, her and the director apparently trashing me and stuff.  She still won't let it go.  It's like that happened.  Who's the director?  15 years ago.  I have no idea.  Exactly.  Let it fucking go.  Leave it alone.  Yeah, she was upset, though.  I'm like, really?  Why would you be upset?  I mean, why would she have said that in the first place?  And she must have, that must have been her take on the situation.  At least that's what I thought for years.  And then I started hearing about, like, where she stands on the autism thing in terms of, 
[01:40:00]  like, don't inoculate your kids.  I don't know.  Oh, right, yeah, because that's a big controversy, whether people getting their kids inoculated  are causing autism or not.  Well, I just had to go through that, because you don't know what to do.  Yeah, we went through it as well.  I mean, long before Jenny McCarthy, you know, brought attention to it, my wife was just like,  I don't know if I want to go with all these shots.  Yeah, we all do that, man.  We don't know.  And when those needles hit the little tiny baby thighs, holy shit, they stop fucking breathing,  turn beet red. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, it's fun.  A pile of little inoculated arms.  If I had a division of men like that, our troubles here would be over very quickly.  A little inoculated arm pile.  I know, that division was just horrid.  We weren't sure, so we're talking to our pediatrician.  She goes, my kids just had it done literally before we got here.  I'm like, well, I guess that's good enough for me.  Bring in the needles.  There's some you've got to go through with, you know?  Right.  And then there's some, yeah, that's kind of like, do you need this much antibiotic in 
[01:41:00]  a kid that, like, we don't live in that world anymore?  It's not a third world country, man.  They pump the kid full of shit where it's just like, some of these diseases don't really  exist anymore, do they?  Smallpox?  Yeah.  You know?  I thought we had the whooping cough beat, but Danny, they're all coming back.  Danny just showed some stats.  I don't want to sound like a xenophobe, even though I am one.  I don't want to sound like one.  But there are a lot of people coming into this country bringing back some of these diseases 
[01:41:30]  that have been, you know, eradicated.  I guess that's only historically fair, though, because we came to this country and we brought  diseases and wiped out the natural population.  That's how we cured them.  Yeah, we're like, here's some blankets and some booze.  Fuck off.  You're cured.  Get in your little corner here.  Exactly.  Stay to yourself.  We gave them shiny things to look at.  Thanks for Manhattan.  Here's a bead, idiot.  Oops.  Oopsie.  But it's like, things like, they're making a big deal out of bedbugs. 
[01:42:00]  You know, bedbugs in the hotels.  Now, look, I stay in a lot of fucking hotels.  I don't think I'm bringing any bedbugs.  And believe me, I've spent a good four days laying in my own filth in my bed at home.  Right.  I'm not bringing bedbugs around, though.  Right.  You know, I kind of make sure I'm bedbug-less.  How do you know, though?  I think it's somebody coming in because I've never seen a fucking bedbug.  They're out there.  It's people coming in from faraway lands with the old steamer trunk, like from I Love Lucy,  full of bedbugs.  That's what I picture.  Do you know anything about the bedbug? 
[01:42:30]  We did a podcast on bedbugs, so I've looked up a bunch of them.  Oh, really?  You got a lot of bedbugs facts?  How they mate is amazing.  The female has no vagina.  Why would she?  Useless.  So basically, the male penetrates her stomach.  Oh, right.  Has to actually stick her with her.  Yeah, it's called, oh, what's the word for it?  Traumatic insemination.  Which, that does.  That's actually, that term actually applies.  What's more traumatic than somebody jamming a dick in your stomach?  Damn, that's right through the stomach wall.  And they said that, uh, since the, you know, they're fucking bugs, they can't always necessarily 
[01:43:00]  in the, in the heat of, of, uh, what is it called when you're, when you're.  Oh, passion and fucking.  Instead of like, they'll lance dudes sometimes.  Who are like, I'm a guy!  Oh, my God.  Oh, bedbug cum in your guts.  What a horrible life this is.  You live in the darkness, in a crack, in a crevice.  You come out, suck a little blood for about two minutes and fucking go hide for the rest of  the time.  When you fuck, you're either killing or being killed.  Wait, does the female die?  I don't think so. 
[01:43:30]  Oh.  But, hurts though.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like a bitch, yeah.  Oof.  Traumatic insemination.  I don't want to be fucked in the belly at all.  And I got a lot of fucking belly to, I can spare it, man.  I might not even feel it.  You could play just the tip, I wouldn't even know.  But still, that kind of thing.  That sounds horrific.  Traumatic insemination, dude.  Yeah, that's rough.  How awful is it to be sleeping and to think that some bedbug is having its stomach split by a bedbug  cock?  They're fucking right next to you.  Right underneath your pillow.  And they're just sitting there going, first I'm going to fuck you in the belly, then we're  going to suck this guy's blood. 
[01:44:00]  He be chibis.  He's still got common blood on the bottom of his bedbug dick.  He's going to crush your fucking neck.  Yuck.  They said that the way to find them is telltale fecal marks.  Really?  Yeah, they shit, apparently.  They have to shit.  And they're very thin streaks.  It's so fucking good.  Where do they shit, though?  In your bed.  Like in your mattress.  So if you see like little thin streaks.  You could just be inhaling it.  Yeah.  That means you got bedbugs somewhere.  Bedbug poop.  Hiding.  Do you look at them on your sheet or under, you think?  I don't know.  Based on what I read on Wikipedia is on the sheet. 
[01:44:30]  When I saw a piece that they did.  Because they suck off you and as they head, they make their long journey back to their  little hole.  I guess they take shit.  They're streaking.  Is that the shit?  Yeah.  I've seen pieces on them where if you look at your mattress and pull it up and I'll open  up crevices.  What are they getting in your bed?  Look at this.  It's shitting.  How big do they get?  Do we know?  10 feet long.  They showed a picture of my armadillos next to a person's pinky and you could see it.  I went really big.  Yeah, you did.  I went 10 feet long.  Exactly.  I said armadillo.  That's funnier.  Yeah, because like armadillo's eyes.  You feel them walking across your chest shitting. 
[01:45:00]  Like the tip of your pinky, I'm assuming?  They're small in that.  Well, they showed one next to somebody's pinky.  They're like between a flea and a tick.  Yeah, they look like a flea or a tick.  You're right.  They do the same thing.  Bed bug scale.  Oh, good pull.  That's what it looks like.  There it is.  That's actually bigger than I thought.  And look at its ass all full of blood.  That's what it is.  Its whole body's full of blood.  I've had that crawl out of my hair.  What?  Yeah, that bug.  No way.  Yeah, I've had one of those crawl out of my hair.  Disinfect this place. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, really?  It's going to be all over you.  He has bed bugs.  They were saying that not only that, they're not, I mean, bed bugs is kind of like a cutesy  name for them, but they're in everything.  They carry, they go in clothing, they go in blankets.  There are bugs that fucking attach and feed to your eyelashes.  You ever hear those things?  I don't know what the name is, but they grip onto your eyelashes and suck the blood right  out of your fucking eyelid.  That's so rude, man.  I know.  It's like, why do you need to do that?  Can't you just latch onto a foot?  Go to an animal.  They don't care.  Yeah, they don't care.  You think a deer cares if the doughy little eyelashes have bugs all over them? 
[01:46:00]  We give a shit.  We sit there and we kind of form our lives and figure out what to do and figure, think  about the shit to talk about, worry about our life.  These creatures live such a simple, horrible existence.  It's just so bad, dude.  At least you never want to come back as a bed bug.  No.  Could you imagine you were once a human, you come back as a bed bug and you're like, I  used to fuck in a bed.  Now I eat and poop in the bed.  Well, it depends on whose bed you were in.  I mean, if it was fucking Jeffrey Tambor, that would kind of suck, but if it was Megan 
[01:46:30]  Fox, just keep biting her cliff.  Oh, is that one of those bugs, Danny?  Which one is that?  The eyelash bugs.  They're really like microscopic.  It don't matter if you can't see them.  They're microscopic.  They're doing it right now.  You don't know.  Is it really?  They're that small and they're just feeding off the other?  Supposedly, yeah.  And what are the ones that...  Supposedly you got all sorts of tiny bugs on your body at all times.  Then there's the other bugs that just eat your dead skin in your bed.  Yeah, but that's helpful.  Like some kind of mites and shit.  How about right off your body?  They're right there right now.  You know what you do? 
[01:47:00]  You fucking take your sheets off and wash them.  You don't need bugs cleaning up after you.  What the fuck is this?  Caveman time?  It's like, fuck, we're animals.  That's what sharks have.  They have things that clean them and we have things that clean up our dead skin.  You got bugs on you right now.  Remora sticks on a shark, just kind of eats the shit that falls and cleans his bed.  Sounds like the name of a girl that works at DMV.  Remora.  Get over here, Remora.  Ew, what is that?  Come on, Remora.  Crusty bug eye.  Those are the bugs in the eyes?  No, that guy has a whole different problem.  That guy has pubic lice on his eyelashes.  Pubic lice on your eyelashes. 
[01:47:30]  There's too much bad shit out there.  I don't need this.  And that's also one of those things without the internet, you never would have saw that  picture.  No, no, they never had a magazine you could open to see that.  You could get pubic lice on your eyelashes.  He's probably eating some snatch.  That's got to be it, right?  Eating some hairy bush that was up to his eyebrows.  You think he's got an itchy eye?  Oh my God, that's fucking horrendous.  Oh, I'm sure he's digging in, right?  And she had like a fucking, looked like a black bikini ball.  Oh, what is that, Danny?  Same thing.  What are those things, man?  Same thing.  Those are pubic lice. 
[01:48:00]  Pubic lice.  Hanging on the eyelash.  Oh, they don't know.  They think it's a ball bag.  Yeah, they're probably like, what an odd looking vagina.  These are the cleanest smelling balls I've ever been on.  Hey, I feel like this cunt is looking at me.  That's horrible.  Oh, I don't need that.  Pubic lice.  They're all in your eyelashes.  You'd probably put glasses on.  Oh, man.  That's right, Chef.  What's that?  More of the same?  So what, it's just walking on its skin now?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:48:30]  Look, it's trekking off.  Look how close to the open eye it is.  Look at the damage they're doing.  Oh, get the fuck.  Who took the picture?  I hope it's the doctor right before he cures them.  Why do we even try?  Can we have some kind of pubic lice contest?  I've had crabs three times.  I've never had lice.  Ew.  Years ago.  The same girl gave them to me twice in a week.  I was so...  I swear to God.  What's wrong with you?  I knew she had them, so I still had some rid and a comb.  And she was so fucking awful.  I remember one time she was standing on my steps.  I could smell her vagina through her jeans. 
[01:49:00]  That's the truth.  Wow.  She was horrendous.  She was wearing a hurt locker suit, and you smelled her vagina.  The same fucking girl gave them crabs.  Nothing worse than a smelly vagina.  Wow.  That was a...  I fucked her on the rug in her house, and then a week later I fucked her again, and I saw one.  I'm like, yeah, it was her.  But I just fucking...  I got rid of them immediately.  You could see them?  You feel them at first.  The first time...  The second time, I saw a little black thing, and I pulled it off.  His little legs are going.  Get the fuck out of here.  We are so fucking outnumbered in this world by those things. 
[01:49:30]  My pubes are awful.  They're straight like an Asian person.  My fucking pubes are horrid.  Terrible straight pubes.  So it's easy to find them, then, at least.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You could comb them out easy.  You got eyelash pubes.  I'm sure I did.  Yeah, yeah.  The legs were moving?  Yeah, yeah, because you pick it up, and you pull it out of your skin.  How great is it you knew she had, and you went back in?  I thought she did.  Isn't there another way to find out if she had it than to fuck her  and see if you get it again?  I want it to fuck her. 
[01:50:00]  Even though she stunk?  Yeah, you know.  What are you going to do?  You know what?  That's an answer.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, you know.  What am I complaining?  I know exactly what you're talking about.  I was 19.  Of course.  I was lonely.  Nobody liked me.  Is that pubes fucking lice?  Yeah, that's not fun.  What is the sticky fucking rock candy shit they're leaving behind?  That's what I'm looking at.  It looks like the shit that the aliens build when they put you in the wall.  It's probably the edge.  That crystalline fucking encasing shit.  Egg clusters, probably.  No, it's their diarrhea.  Probably is. 
[01:50:30]  It's like some kind of waste product.  STD crabs.  Now I just want to wash my eyebrows.  I know.  I can't scrub my...  It just makes me sick.  Now I'm thinking about that stinky room.  What the fuck?  Oh, God.  That is rude.  Just click on that.  Oh, it's a dirty vagina.  Oh, damn.  Let me see.  We're looking at a vagina that is so pockmarked with bug bites.  I thought it was a redhead.  Bug bites.  It's all swollen.  Are those bug bites?  It looks more like cold cuts. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That looks like...  That is a vagina that went a few rounds with Tyson back in the 90s.  And it's traveled down to the fucking sphincter.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like...  It's a vagina that...  It's all one large crack.  Yeah.  I bet her nickname in high school was old olive loaf pussy.  Kevin, a man of your stature, you've seen the blue waffle, haven't you, sir?  No.  What is that?  Oh, God, no.  You haven't seen the blue waffle?  I don't think so.  I hate the blue waffle.  It ends with the blue waffle.  I mean, Danny, is there any other pictures?  Because you don't go back from the blue waffles.  All right, we'll go blue waffle for Kevin Smith. 
[01:51:30]  The blue waffle.  Blue waffle infection.  Somebody explain it before we go there.  Here's a whole smodcast for you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  What happened?  It's basically a slang term from extremely nasty or severe vaginal infection, STD on the vagina.  The infection could cause lesions on the outside as well as bruising.  I can't even...  Yeah, it probably smells like...  Where is the...  Which causes it to look blue in color.  Where is the...  I can't look at it.  Which one is the vagina?  I can't even look at it.  There's so many different, like, folds and curves.  There's so many things going on there.  Again, an alien. 
[01:52:00]  That looks like when they were dissecting the alien with that probe.  Oh, look at the weird...  And pulling the little lifts of the...  Ah!  Here's the worst part.  It looks like the fucking alien at the end of the Watchmen book.  Like the weird squid pussy on top of it.  The worst part is the little white sticky stuff in the hiney.  Yeah, that's what I looked at.  That's what made me go, oh, what is that?  Just pause?  That whole area should be removed with a post hole digger.  Just lay her down and get rid of it.  Just core her. 
[01:52:30]  She needs to be cored.  How do you let them take a picture?  Yeah, that had to be a doctor taking that picture.  Had to be, right?  Yeah.  Not a very good doctor.  No, not at all.  Everybody spread this around.  You can name it the blue waffle.  Tweeted that one right away.  My name's Dr. Dirty.  I'm not really a medical professional.  I just take pictures.  You gotta get followers any way you can, man.  That truly does it.  Yeah, that's the blue waffle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's like eight kinds of bad.  Yeah, that's not good. 
[01:53:00]  That is not needed.  If you're alone, even if you're alone on the island of loss with that person, I think I'm  still like, I'll take a blowjob instead.  Yeah, you'd still need something.  I'd rather fuck the lice eyebrows than that woman's vagina.  That is just...  Danny can find any sexually transmitted disease online.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Stop it.  That's like the elephant man's pussy.  That's warts.  That's gotta be warts.  Is that a woman or a man?  It looks like a picture of Mars.  I don't know what the fuck that is. 
[01:53:30]  It does.  It's gotta look like Mars.  Get your ass to Mars.  Yeah, it does.  Cool hang on.  She's got the fucking pyramid mines in her snag.  There's Kwato popping out.  That's terrible.  He's gonna give us an important lesson.  Oh, man.  Go to a doctor.  Do you think...  All right.  There's one, two, three, four.  There's three, five dudes here now.  One lady behind a six.  Anybody ever gonna look at something like this in their future?  Personally?  Never. 
[01:54:00]  You think so?  I would never be in a position where I would see that.  No, I mean, like, could it happen to you?  Do you think...  Oh, God.  I would hope never.  Like, this person, you know this person wasn't planning on this.  This shit just kinda happened, unfortunately, for them.  I'm not planning on that.  And you also, you look at it and you're like, oh, they're before the grace of God.  But you never know, man.  20 years from now, you wake up, you're like, what is this thing?  Yeah, but you see one and you have it taken care of.  You don't just leave it until... 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, that's true.  If you start seeing something happening, you might want to take care of it.  Ugh.  Yeah, that's some out of control shit.  That one says Paris Hilton vagina.  Is that its own condition?  That can only mean it isn't.  I've got Paris Hilton vagina.  By the way, Lindsay Lohan has a fucking horrible looking puss.  This photo's of it.  She has the type of vagina I hate, that fucking caved in type of pussy.  It's fucking awful.  Where were their pictures of that?  Danny showed it before.  Oh, what is that? 
[01:55:00]  Oh!  He didn't plan on that.  No.  What is that?  Oh, it's his cock head.  It's a penis and his whole head is like cauliflower, like reddish pink cauliflower growing around it.  It looks like the penis after he got taken.  I grabbed myself.  The penis in The Last Temptation.  Not The Last Temptation.  What was it called?  The Passion of the Christ.  It's just beat the shit out of him, man.  And it's wearing a crown of thorns.  Yeah, true.  That's what it looks like.  A big old fleshy crown of thorns.  That's what you get when you fuck the Book of Revelation. 
[01:55:30]  What a disaster.  Oh, dude.  No, stop.  What happened to him?  I don't want to know.  I want to know.  I never want it to happen to me.  I don't want to do whatever he did.  I think this should be preventative more than anything else.  Unless he stuck his dick in a Cuisinart.  That's either an ugly cock or a delicious party snack.  It's monkey bread.  Oh, shit.  It looks like a little delicious, what do they call those pigs in a blanket?  Moons over my hammy. 
[01:56:00]  Look at that.  Pigs in a tumor.  That's amazing.  It looks like he's got those moon rocks he used to grow as a kid when he got to see monkeys and moon rocks.  It's the moon rocks.  Ugh.  No.  That's fucking horrible.  When the first one sprouted up, why didn't he just rush to a doctor?  No.  Did it happen in ten minutes?  Maybe he thought he was the next step in evolution.  The cock and the sunflower merged.  But dude, find Lindsay Lohan's pussy.  She has a fucking... 
[01:56:30]  Hers is not gross.  It just annoyed me when I saw it.  Because it has that thing...  Annoyed me.  ...where it just goes in.  It's like...  Like where?  On the bottom?  Hard to say.  Danny, there's the picture.  I mean, it's just irritating her.  All right, there it is.  That.  Like, right here.  Maybe something Anthony could probably describe it.  I'm trying to...  Right there on her left side...  She's got a cleft.  A cleft!  Yeah, it looks like a line drive smashed her in the box.  And then, like, the bottom part of the labia majora actually has a...  Like a crease in it, almost.  Like, down. 
[01:57:00]  And then a horizontal crease.  Fair to say.  And then it continues.  Pretty bad angle.  Yeah, that is a bad angle.  When was this picture taken?  Yesterday.  Yeah.  Her pussy is horrible.  Lohan...  What's that?  What?  Oh.  I was like, good God!  I know.  It's like, what are we looking at these little pussy shots for?  She's spraying eagle.  It's like she flat out gave it up.  But, uh...  Man, how many...  When do you fucking learn to wear underwear?  How many times...  If one person got a fucking...  Just a quarter inch of my ball in a photo, I'd be wearing a chastity belt made of iron 
[01:57:30]  for the rest of my life.  Dude, no!  We were on to this years ago.  We knew the women were doing this to get, you know, some press.  They do get a lot of press.  Yeah, when they feel like they need a little bump out there, they'll give you the snatch  shot.  Yeah, but, like...  They all do it.  There's press, but then there's...  They got it.  No.  You're getting out of the back of a limo or...  Big fucking Escalade.  You gotta know that they're gonna get a shot of it, right?  Yeah.  What's up with Lindsay Lohan?  She failed a drug test, and...  Yeah.  Will she go back to jail?  I don't know.  My heart aches for her. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, she's terrific.  She was...  Let me play this...  I went to this mandatory rehab, which I don't think ever works.  I couldn't hate her more.  Really?  Yeah, only because she's just irritating to me, and she's never done anything to make  me like her, and I think she...  Freaky Friday?  Come on.  I don't know what it was.  She was a good little actress back in the day, man.  Yeah.  Like, Freaky Friday, Mean Girls.  When she was a kid, yeah, Mean Girls was good.  But that's a little...  I mean...  But enough already.  I ain't in.  Yeah, she's...  Just enough.  You know why I don't like her?  Because your wife had her niece there, and said that she asked her for an autograph, and 
[01:58:30]  then that Lindsay was a bitch, and ever since then, I fucking hated her guts.  Yeah, Kev, she was on a park bench, Central Park.  She was filming the John Lennon movie that didn't do well.  Was that a good movie?  Did you see it?  Yeah.  I didn't see it.  My wife watched it about two weeks ago.  He put on a lot of weight for it.  He did again.  Yeah.  He looked just like him.  It was creepy.  He did look like him.  This is the weird thing, though.  She watched that two weeks ago, and I saw him on the cover of it, and I was like, whatever  happened to this movie?  I remember the trailer for it and shit.  And she was like, it was fine.  It wasn't that great.  And I was like, wow, man. 
[01:59:00]  Leto put on all that weight.  I wonder if he'll ever take it off.  I was at the fucking VMAs, and there's a dude walks past me, and I was like, man,  that rock star looks like Jared Leto.  Oh, shit.  He's taking his look from Jared Leto.  Who would want to look like Jared Leto?  And it was Jared Leto.  He's a fucking movie singer now.  Yeah.  But he's all ripped.  He won an award, too.  They won some.  He won an award.  He won an award.  I wouldn't say it was ripped.  His band's 30 seconds to mark.  That's it.  And he had bleach blonde fucking short hair.  He doesn't really care about movies.  He wants to do the rock star thing right now.  I think he's down a guy.  Well, it seems like.  The sickest thing I ever saw was that fucking Christian Bale in The Machinist and then Batman. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  And it was like, how the fuck did he do that?  I love The Machinist.  That was a fucking movie, man.  Matt Damon, too, on Courage Under Fire, lost a shit ton of weight to play the junkie part.  I just can't.  I mean.  It's got to be easier to take off the weight and then put it back on and still stay in  shape than gain the weight and try to take it off.  I think it helped.  These cats are thin to begin with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it, too.  It's not their natural condition.  But he did put on.  Leto put on a bunch of fucking weight.  De Niro and fucking Raging Bull. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  That was a big.  That got a lot of publicity when he did that.  80 pounds.  That was the first one who did it.  It was the first one who did it.  80 pounds.  He was the first, right?  Yeah.  I don't think he did that before that.  No.  And also, he did it for The Untouchables.  He put on even more.  Right.  Remember?  And if you watch him in Taxi Driver, he's a rail.  Yeah.  He's got like nothing.  And Cape Fury's cut.  Let me get your expert opinion here.  Now, obviously, you lost a lot of weight in the machinist.  We're looking at a split screen.  Is that some makeup, too, to make it look worse than it is?  Because we're looking at a complete rib cage right there.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That doesn't even look like makeup to me.  What's the machinist about? 
[02:00:30]  How could it?  That's like.  He's a guy that has this.  That's dangerously thin.  This job.  And he's alone.  And it's kind of a psychological.  Okay.  Is it good?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's good.  I liked it.  Yeah, totally.  It's hard to describe.  But it's fucking.  It's not like.  Hey, man.  Let's all get together and watch the machinist.  It's more like.  You know.  I was home and I watched the machinist by myself.  It was pretty good.  It's a good date movie.  Yeah.  It's pretty grim.  Yeah.  God, look at how thin he was, man.  Unbelievable.  And then he got all bulk for Batman. 
[02:01:00]  Good.  Wow.  Fucking amateur.  Yeah.  You've seen any good movies lately, Kevin?  I know that we're.  What did I see?  I saw.  I saw Ben's movie.  The Town, which I really liked.  Oh, yeah.  How was that?  I heard a lot of people said it's really good.  He did a really good job with it.  Did a good job.  He's good in it.  And, you know, some great bank robbing sequences is good.  Totally cool.  Do you look at his directing style and go like, you know, yeah, fucker got that from me.  No.  No.  Not every million years.  I'm kidding me.  There are some people on the net who are trying to be like, your fucking boy's a better director  than you. 
[02:01:30]  I'm like, right on.  Yeah.  Bank heist comedy.  Bank heist movies, absolutely.  But let me see him do a comedy and then we'll talk.  You know.  It's just like, why can't he be good at that and I be good at my thing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah.  They want to like drive a wedge or something.  But I'm like, I thought it was great.  I thought he did a great job.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Is it scary?  Yeah.  Is it a horror film?  No.  It's like a bank heist movie.  Okay.  Bank heist.  But it's done very well from what I hear.  Yeah.  It opened number one.  It was like 24 million bucks.  Yeah.  I haven't been to movies in a long fucking time.  That was the first time I went with my wife in quite some time.  And before that, just watching a lot of DVDs. 
[02:02:00]  I watched The Joneses recently, which I enjoyed with Demi Moore and David Duchovny.  It's kind of an interesting concept.  What is it?  This family moves into the suburban neighborhood, but they're not really a family.  They're just all kind of put together by this corporation.  They go out into the neighborhood wearing these different clothing, playing with different high-end expensive toys and stuff.  And essentially, the neighbors then want to copy them.  And they go to the mall and buy the shit.  And so these people are just basically a sales force that are tied in with the local commercial venues and whatnot. 
[02:02:30]  So essentially, they wear it.  He'll be sitting there playing golf, David Duchovny.  It's a great shot.  I don't know what they call it in golf.  But he starts talking about how cool the putter is, and then everybody wants the putter.  It's a good idea.  And then at the end, it kind of turns into a standard kind of relationship movie.  But it was a good concept, I thought.  Pretty cool.  Movies really...  She looks fucking astounding.  Still.  Oh, my God.  Amazing.  What is she doing?  Nothing unnatural, it would seem. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah?  Because I...  That movie is in HD.  Is Ashton Kutcher just getting old?  Is it like a Twilight Zone?  She just sucks the fucking life out of her?  Totally.  He's Dorian Gray somewhere.  Sucking the youth out of him.  Is he just old?  He cheated on her, supposedly, somebody said.  Whoa!  Yeah, there's rumors out there.  With who?  I don't know.  Some chick.  Rue McClanahan.  He's got the worst Twitter account.  Who?  Oh, Ashton.  A plus K?  Oh, it's the worst.  What does he do?  He's got all those followers and does nothing. 
[02:03:30]  I don't...  He's no longer the top dog, though, right?  Isn't it like Lady Gaga now?  Is it Lady Gaga?  I think she is the most.  Gaga.  And she actually...  She's pretty active with her.  You were at the VMAs?  Did you run into her in her meat dress?  No.  Did she wear it there?  Yeah, she did.  At this award ceremony?  I believe so, right?  I don't think she wore it to the...  I saw her, but...  Didn't she...  I haven't seen the meat dress, but I never saw her before.  Ever.  Didn't she accept one of her awards with the meat dress?  Oh, I don't know.  I think that might have been last year.  This year, no meat.  Kenny's going yes.  Kenny's saying yes.  Was that at the VMAs?  That's this year? 
[02:04:00]  I believe so.  Yeah, she's worn the meat suit a few places.  Yeah, that's this year's meat suit.  I recognize the shoes.  We noticed she used cheap meat.  She used strip steak and some flank steak.  A lot of flank steak.  Minute steak, if you will.  It's a steak-up outfit.  Very grainy.  Yeah, that's a weird statement, I guess.  I don't know what she was doing.  Her statement was for...  What was this one for?  She doesn't even know.  She made it up on the spot when they asked her, I think.  Where is she from?  Here.  Mars.  From New York? 
[02:04:30]  She's a New York City girl.  Is she?  Correct.  Yeah, she used to play in the village all the time.  That was the first time I saw her was at the VMAs, and she had a hard time getting around  because she had a lot of clothing.  A lot of weird stuff on her.  That was not this year, man.  I'm telling you, that was last year.  Was it?  Yeah, because...  I don't remember seeing her wearing meat at all.  Maybe you thought it was a dress.  Yeah, you might have just thought...  I would have remembered that, man.  That would have made an impression.  I'm starting to think Kevin didn't have good seats at the VMAs.  I was three seats from the stage. 
[02:05:00]  Where Kanye came out and performed, I could have threw a tissue at him.  Right on.  But she, I guess, was over to the left.  I didn't see the meat suit.  Yeah.  Did you like Chelsea Handler?  Um, she was fine, you know.  I didn't understand why they tapped her.  Like, did something happen?  What's that?  That's one of her fucking dresses.  That was also meat?  No, no.  That's last year.  This is not meat, but that's her outfit last year.  That's the communicable penis disease suit.  Look at her hat.  This kind of looked like one of those cocks that we saw.  Top of a fucking tampon hat disease cock. 
[02:05:30]  You can't even describe.  It looks like she was sprayed with blood, I guess.  Well, she's got, uh, it looks like lace over her face.  Ah, right, okay.  In a prince kind of way.  Red all the way from knees to...  What's the sincerity there and just the complete publicity?  I don't think...  Is she any different, though, than Madonna?  Yeah, Madonna, like, would change her shit every few years.  Well, she's only been here for, like, what?  A couple, like, a year, two years or something?  I mean, if I'm just hearing about her now, she's just...  If I'm just...  If she's coming on my radar, that means that she's relatively... 
[02:06:00]  She's such a fucking weirdo.  I don't know, it's just weird.  Well, that's why she's doing it.  But that's kind of like, I mean, that's a...  For all the other weirdos out there, this is what she's doing today.  Well, her little monsters need her.  Yeah.  Oh, stop it.  Or what's the...  Who was the other guy?  Alice Cooper.  It's kind of like Alice Cooper, Marilyn Manson, Elton John, when he used to put on big outfits  and whatnot.  You know, it's just...  Yeah, I guess so.  Fine.  It's nothing...  I mean, it's...  I'm certainly not saying what she does isn't good, but it's not very...  It's not new.  We've seen it before, yeah.  She's kind of picked up the mantle and ran with it. 
[02:06:30]  And she's like, all right, Madonna, wear a fucking pointy bustier, I'm going to wear  meat.  Meat suit.  The total meat suit.  But her explanation as to what it was was so fucking horrid.  What was it?  She was on Ellen and she said it was like something about how if we don't stand up for our rights  pretty soon, we're not going to have any more rights than the meat on our bones.  It was like, you're shoehorning.  Specious, yeah, best.  That wasn't what it was for.  She was trying so hard to make a statement out of it when it was just, ah, I just figured  I'd wear meat today.  Yeah.  She was like, why'd I do it?  Because it looks fucked up. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, it's fucked up.  Because you're going to talk about it.  It's amazing.  Why didn't anyone wear meat before?  Is that her wearing a Kermit coat?  A Kermit, yeah, a lot of Kermits.  That's what she looks like?  Is that an old picture?  Those are all Kermits?  What a dumb jacket.  Looks like she's being raped by frogs.  This is like an early attempt at Lady Gaga.  Yeah, she is trying.  How does she sit down?  Is that her right there?  On big cocks.  Oh, it's her hiney.  That's a nice ass right there. 
[02:07:30]  All right, look at that.  Yeah, all right.  Nothing wrong with that.  Does she do that a lot?  I see her wearing lots of clothes.  This is actually her wearing very little clothes.  Ah, she's all over the place for this stuff.  That ain't a bad ass.  I like that ass.  I'm a lady gag.  All right.  Now we're just looking at the internet.  I know.  Now we spend way too much time looking at the internet.  I know.  That's usually a sign to take a little break, which we could do.  And don't forget, Kevin Smith is announcing that his Smodcast comes to the virus, and we're 
[02:08:00]  really excited about that.  Yeah.  And there'll be promos on the channel explaining everything.  Every weekend.  Every weekend.  It's about fucking time we got the Smodcast back on the virus.  We had it for a little while.  You did, totally, in the beginning.  We went away for, I don't know, three or four years, because that's how long it takes  for things around here.  But it's back, and that's great.  Happy to be here.  Awesome.  Happy to be here.  You want to take questions, Kevin?  Because everyone has questions.  Yeah, let's do it.  All right.  We'll do it after the break.  People want to know about how you feel about some of the comic book movies coming out.  Okay.  Oh, the hard questions. 
[02:08:30]  Yes, the real hard one.  I'm ready for those.  All right.  When are they going to make the Archies into a movie?  That'll be soon, right?  They just added a gay character to the Archie universe.  They did, yeah.  All right.  His name's Kevin, ironically.  His name is Steve Carlisi.  Yeah.  Poor Steve.  We'll talk about all that stuff next.  The Virus Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  Kevin Smith in studio today. 
[02:09:00]  Hello.  This song rocked.  I got a text from...  You came on the radio.  You were just rocking.  Yeah.  What is this?  I'll live it up in a minute.  In a minute.  Yeah.  You got a text?  You said...  Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve.  It's just to correct the... 
[02:09:30]  Crabs are lice, Jimmy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Same thing.  Yeah.  Crabs are just head lice?  Or lice.  It's the same creature.  Same family?  Yeah.  Pubic lice is crabs.  So I guess he took my elitist statement so that I've never had lice to task.  Yes, he did.  He showed you.  Yeah.  I really thought I was a fucking big man on campus because I'd only had crabs.  He had to show you.  He showed you.  He certainly did.  Kevin, we got a guy on the line.  Just saw Cop Out last night.  Great movie.  What I want to say about Cop Out really fast is the commentary was just awesome. 
[02:10:00]  Did you watch the Blu-ray thing?  Yeah.  I watched from beginning to end and I'm not...  What was it called?  The MMM.  Yeah, yeah.  MCM.  Maximum comedy mode version.  Yeah.  That was fun, wasn't it?  It was awesome and I got to tell you, I'm not really into all that geek stuff.  I'm not that guy, but I just loved it.  I'll be honest with you, that is the best version of that movie, I feel.  But naturally, I feel that way because I'm in it. 
[02:10:30]  Right.  Like when you watch that version of Cop Out on Blu-ray, it's the movie itself and then  I periodically pop up and start talking and then bring you over to deleted scenes.  Right.  Very interactive.  The easiest way to describe it is kind of like a feature merged with one of the Q&As.  So the movie winds up being like three hours, which some people are like, fuck you, I hated  that movie at an hour and a half.  Why do I got to watch three?  But it's even more entertaining, I feel like, with me sitting there trying to explain myself.  Right.  I love it.  Trying to explain myself. 
[02:11:00]  I love it.  Thanks for watching, man.  He's jumping around like, all right, let me show you now the deleted scenes over here  and then, well, we got to fast forward to here because then it makes sense to see this  first before we go back here.  It was...  Sean William Scott pops up.  I love Sean William Scott.  He's a funny motherfucker.  He is really good.  He is a really funny guy.  Didn't it sell well on Blu-ray too?  It did.  We opened really strongly.  Like that week when we came out, I think we had the top sales, top rental, top digital,  and top Blu-ray or something.  So it was a nice little kind of bittersweet kind of like, yay, people did like it. 
[02:11:30]  Because in the moment, boy, every critic on the planet just wants to make you believe.  They still do it, dude.  They still.  Every time they get a chance, they just pull out a knife and be like, not like Cop Out.  Meanwhile, on Twitter, dude, all I see is the people that buy tickets and a lot of motherfuckers  really like that movie.  I was confused by all that because I really liked the movie.  Simple as that.  Oh, you're just saying that because you guys are friends with Kevin Smith.  No, I liked the fucking movie.  All that matters is what Entertainment Weekly says because that magazine has their finger 
[02:12:00]  on the pulse.  What did they say about you recently?  Oh, nothing.  They've just never said anything good about anything I like.  Yeah, I'm not.  Just snarky twats.  I'm so over it.  I used to enjoy press.  And back in the early days, before the internet and whatnot, I used to save it.  Like articles, they would talk about the movies we did.  Oh, wow.  My father started it.  He'd be like, here's a pile of clippings I pulled from your stuff.  And I didn't want to throw him out because he took the time to do it and shit.  So we started laminating him in books because I figured we could always refer to him. 
[02:12:30]  We had volumes and volumes of books.  And we just kept doing it out of kind of common practice without ever thinking, like,  all this shit's available on the internet.  You didn't have to save it.  But, I mean, when we started, there was no, like, kind of a repository of articles and  past and present and whatnot.  So it was okay.  I did the exact same thing.  Laminate.  Laminate.  Laminate.  But it's all how we're just assholes and shitty people and this and that.  But I still collected it.  Right.  I mean, it was, to me, I think I might have two articles where we're actually human beings 
[02:13:00]  and they like it.  I don't know.  It was still, even, God, 10 years into my career, I always found it kind of thrilling  that somebody would, like, be writing about the flicks we did or putting my name in the  paper.  And then after the Southwest thing, I could care less.  I hate the media now, like, with a passion.  I felt like they really all kind of fucked me over and abandoned me in a weird way with  that thing.  Because I'd always been really kind of friendly with a lot of people.  And, again, you don't know everybody when you say the media. 
[02:13:30]  It's not like there's one person representing everybody.  But I was very, very press-friendly and very friendly with journalists.  And I really felt like none of them showed up.  None of them showed up except to kick me while I was down.  Right.  They had the opportunity to have that story that everyone's going to go, oh, did you  hear?  And they weren't going to stop and take another angle on it.  They're fucking weasels.  Because they're fucking weasels.  They're lazy weasels.  And case in point, man, Affleck spent two weeks out on the road in advance of this movie  coming out getting asked the same stupid fucking questions. 
[02:14:00]  Over and over.  I read a bunch of his articles because I was like, great, man, hopefully they're going  to cut this dude some slack.  They're all still bringing up Jennifer Lopez.  Oh, you're kidding me?  That shit happened seven fucking years ago.  They're still bringing up Jennifer Lopez.  They bring up fucking Daredevil, Gigli, Jersey Girl.  And it's just like, this dude has done a shit ton of stuff since then.  And all they want to do is write that article about, like, he's been in jail for seven  years.  Will this one let him out?  Just so they hope that, like, if the movie does well, they could be like, Ben Affleck's 
[02:14:30]  back and we brought him back.  It was such lazy journalism, dude.  And we're talking high profile pieces, not even just podunk shit.  Like, major newspapers, right?  All of them wrote the same fucking piece.  And that's not saying, like, well, Ben Affleck's not that interesting.  Ben Affleck's a pretty interesting fucking guy.  They just all wanted to write the same fucking thing.  Just do a little research and come up with a different angle.  Look what I got.  I'm going to give him a little poke here.  Like, hey, remember when you were dating Jennifer Lopez?  That didn't work out.  And he's like, why the fuck are we talking about?  But he dutifully sat there and took it. 
[02:15:00]  Like, I didn't see him in any press blow up or be like, fuck off.  I don't want to talk about this.  Take the mic off and walk away.  No, he fucking, he did it, man.  And I was like, wow, good for him.  I wouldn't have stood for that, man.  No way.  Never again.  I can't wait.  I go out in the world and if people want to talk about Southwest, I'll be like, fuck you.  You could have talked about it when it happened.  I'm not going to talk about it now.  It's ridiculous.  I didn't ask you about that, really.  You know what I mean?  I take a bus now.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah, exactly.  It lets the bus stories.  That's all I cared about.  I found my first article ever written on me. 
[02:15:30]  I was six months in comedy.  My friend's brother wrote it.  He was like, worked for the local paper.  It was called, Comedy is Not Always a Laughing Matter.  Can you bring it in?  Not the way I was doing it.  It wasn't.  And I remember saying, I haven't read it.  I didn't read the article recently, but I remember saying like, my influence, I'm kind of  like Robin Williams and I talk a lot about game shows and things that piss me off.  How old are you?  21.  That's awesome.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  I should have been fucking kicked in the chest. 
[02:16:00]  What a faggot.  Oh, wow.  I got the first article written on me.  We should have a day where we bring them in.  Bring yours in.  Mine's horrendous.  It's horrid.  I was interviewed in a Chinese restaurant and just made some horrible points.  Horrible.  And it's printed in a local rag who gives a shit fucking magazine.  I should bring in my interview that I did.  Did I ever show you the interview I did after my first TV tape of Friday Night Videos?  Really not good.  I was high energy, wacky.  I can't watch it.  I hate that guy.  Yeah, it fucking stinks. 
[02:16:30]  You were a different dude?  I was a cunt.  Were you?  Do a little piece of that Jimmy then.  No, I was the energy.  I was like, how we doing?  You know, I was just like so friendly.  You put on a voice too like that.  Oh, dude.  It was like, let me tell you about something I saw in here.  Fuck it.  My girlfriend wants to watch some of it.  I'm like, you won't fuck me.  With a lot of these things?  Like, I should have, you know.  You were playing a character.  But it was awful and I can't look at it.  Was that the one we saw recently?  The one we saw recently.  We should give Kevin a taste though.  No, that was fucking, I was, no, that's, I'm less the same to that. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, that actually wasn't as bad as.  I do an interview after this Friday Night Videos taping and I'm just,  trying to be charming and I'm fucking, it's humiliating when you see like how you thought  you were being this great interview back then.  Totally.  Oh, no.  You really thought you were nailing it?  What a glop of shit.  They never aired it.  Glop.  Fucking humiliating.  Glop.  When you were doing it, were you like, I like doing this.  You were like, I know I'm not doing the right thing.  Oh, no.  I thought I was terrific.  You were into it? 
[02:17:30]  I'm embarrassed to say, like sometimes you don't know how to admit things.  Yeah.  Like, it never aired.  It was supposed to air after your segment, of course.  They're probably like this little douchebag.  But I said something to her, like, we were talking and she asked me how I got in a comedy.  I'm like, well, you know, I was a big Richard Pryor fan and then I waved in case he was watching.  No, you didn't.  I did.  What?  I did.  Oh, I gotta see this.  Oh, no, you didn't do that.  I did.  Hi, Richard.  That was fucking...  Did you say, like, hi, Richard? 
[02:18:00]  No, but I was kind of trying to be funny about it, but it was pathetic and not funny and desperate.  It's humiliating.  It was the day he lit himself on fire.  He was watching.  I would have been watching, but I was in flames.  But you look back on that shit and you're just like, it's fucking cringeworthy.  Oh, yeah.  I can't watch it.  It's like living in the office, the British office.  Best show ever, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Gervais just, oh, how uncomfortable is it to watch him? 
[02:18:30]  You know what else was good?  Like, along those lines, and a lot of people didn't give it credit.  Did you ever see the one with what's-her-face, the chick from Friends?  I loved it, too, on HBO.  Fucking the comeback.  Wasn't it amazing?  It was so uncomfortable.  I thought it was so fucking good, so unbelievably uncomfortable.  That's one of my favorite DVD watches.  I popped that in.  I could watch that whole season.  Because there's only 12 episodes.  You're out in six hours.  Yeah, yeah.  And each one of those half hours, there's definitely something in there that's laugh out loud.  How great was her fucking makeup man, Nick?  Yeah. 
[02:19:00]  There's one scene, and it was so well done.  And she's flying somewhere, right?  And he's with her, and she's flying first.  And the lady goes, will that be two and first?  And like, you know she doesn't want to fly this lump first class.  But she's like, oh, yeah, okay, special, my treat.  And he's like, oh, okay.  And it was so perfectly-  Well, the conceit is that the cameras are always on them, because it's, you know, like a documentary.  Yeah, yeah.  So she's like, if the camera wasn't there, she would have been like, no, he's back in college.  But the camera's there, so she's like, okay, yeah, Mickey can ride up for that.  Yeah, my treat.  Oh, Mickey, that was her name. 
[02:19:30]  And the fighting with the writers all the time about her role in the show, because there  was a show within a show, and just so like, oh, do she?  That was the only part, there was one part, like one of the writers was almost too mean  to her.  It was like, you would never talk to the talent like that on a show.  I forget what his name is.  Paul, I think his name is.  Paulie, Paulie D.  You would never talk to the talent.  Nah, you wouldn't.  But she was like, supposed to really be on the down slide.  Well, she was being shoehorned into, like, the conceit of the show was she was being  shoehorned into their sitcom.  And they had won an Emmy for creating another sitcom before. 
[02:20:00]  So the one writer was very political and kind of like, hi, how are you?  And the other one was just utter content.  And it was a little, it might have been a little too much, like too soon, because you're  like, who would ever act like this?  Just do that nasty.  Totally.  But I guess there are people like that.  And she was so out of place on the show.  Like, she was so out of place.  Remember when she did the robot at the end?  Oh, God.  We used to do the robot at the end of the...  Of her old series.  Yeah, because she had a series years ago.  She punches the dude in the stomach and he pukes. 
[02:20:30]  She's dressed like a cupcake.  What was the old show called?  The original show?  I'm It.  I'm It.  I'm It.  And she kept trying to come up with a catchphrase for this one.  She was like, I don't even want to see that.  That was her catchphrase.  Oh, it is an amazing show to watch.  It really is.  It's so uncomfortable.  It's like right up there with the original British office in terms of like something that  you're watching going, oh my God.  I'm going to have to find that again on a DVD and watch that because I saw it when it was  originally on and I actually commented on it on the show and I was like, have you guys 
[02:21:00]  seen this?  Because it's unbearably uncomfortable.  Yeah, I thought it was amazingly well done.  They canceled the show?  Yeah.  They just did it in one season.  I mean, it had its own arc.  It kind of self-contained.  They didn't leave you hanging.  I'm sure they won a second season.  It felt like they did, but I think early on, I guess a lot of people weren't tuning in,  but I think more people found it on DVD.  They should really think about doing it because it was so fucking good.  Right on.  Let's go to the phones.  Everybody has something for Kevin Smith today.  Marty in Chicago.  Marty. 
[02:21:30]  Hey, boys.  How's it going this morning?  I was having fun just hanging with Kevin.  Hey, Kevin, I had actually a couple of questions.  All right.  Mad Men on AMC and Breaking Bad.  What do you think?  And also, I think a person who does great interviews is that Terry Gross on NPR Fresh Air.  She had Jon Hamm on it.  She really got a lot out of him, more than just the standard hub.  Yeah, Terry Gross, she's been a pro forever, man.  Whoever she interviews, she usually pulls something good out of him.  Did you ever hear that fucking Gene Simmons interview she did?  No.  She hosts Fresh Air on NPR, if I'm remembering correctly. 
[02:22:00]  She did an interview with Gene Simmons.  This is available somewhere online.  Can you look up Gene Simmons, NPR, Fresh Air, or something like that, where he is so over-the-top, hostile to her, almost like the comedy writer.  Oh, man, really?  Like, and he keeps, there's a chip on his shoulder about NPR.  Like, he keeps saying, like, you and your NPR people, like, you know.  Well, he's much more conservative, probably, than they are.  He probably has a political thing with them, because he's, Gene's conservative.  Is he really? 
[02:22:30]  Much more conservative, I think, than they are.  I mean, can you play this sort of thing, or is it...  It's a little long.  It is long.  But he kind of goes at her in the first few.  Yeah, let's go.  It should make you feel any less vulnerable, or any less like Gene Simmons, or your other names, Gene Klein, or Chaim White, which was your birth name.  Close, but no guitars.  It's Chaim Witz.  Oh, thanks.  Okay.  You said it...  Well, the name came out through Gentile mouth, so it didn't quite have the flavor.  It came out bland.  All right, now stop it real quick.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know anything about him.  Is that a sense of humor? 
[02:23:00]  He might have been being slightly sarcastic, but Gene is a weird guy, like, uh...  He's a...  That's...  You know what that was?  She pulled out, like, that, all right, look what I know about you kind of thing, and he didn't like the fact that, oh, you're just saying this because you think you know more than everybody else.  It gets worse.  And he gets...  Yeah.  And he is like that.  He's a nasty man.  We've had it on the show.  That's my opinion.  Not Jimmy's.  I like him.  I find him to be a nasty man.  I'm with Anthony. 
[02:23:30]  He's...  I still like Kiss, but he's just a dick.  And what he did to Danny that day...  Explain the Danny thing.  And Kevin will love this story.  Danny is constantly trolling for stuff on the internet.  Right.  That's part of his job here on the show.  So, he's next to Gene Simmons.  Studio is smaller.  That's the old XM place.  Uh-huh.  Well, the board...  And Danny's doing this.  Now, that's what you'd hear.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just fucking...  And Gene's talking.  Without looking over at Danny or missing a beat with him talking, he continues talking. 
[02:24:00]  He puts his hand over on top of Danny's hands to make him stop typing while he's talking.  And we were just like...  That's like an elder statesman move.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just don't.  And condescending at the same time.  So condescending.  Extremely.  Extremely.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Completely unnecessary.  Very.  And so just...  It wasn't like it was type, type, type, type.  It was...  Yeah, he wasn't banging away on the fucking keyboard.  It was quiet.  I had him in a comic book store out in Los Angeles at Golden Apple many, many years ago,  back when it was on its other location, its original location. 
[02:24:30]  And Bill Leibowitz, a guy who owned the store, who's passed now, he was just like, have you  ever met Gene Simmons?  And I was like, no.  I was not a big kiss guy, but my friend Walter was a huge kiss guy.  So just in honor of that, I was just like, I got to meet him just so I could tell Walter  I met Gene Simmons.  So I went over and he introduced us.  I was like, hey, man, how are you?  And within, no lie, two minutes, he had whipped out a notebook and was showing me all these  projects that he was involved in.  Yes.  He was showing me off his resume.  And then he flipped the page and he showed me a bag with money on it. 
[02:25:00]  Who is this person?  Oh, that he owns that.  Oh, this is that chick from fucking Delaware.  Is that who it is?  She's running for something?  What's her name?  Yeah.  She's going to win.  Wow.  Well, they found something on her.  Oh.  She's an actress, though, right?  Yeah, she was something.  She used to be an actress?  She looks familiar to me.  Bill Maher found something on her about how she was talking about being a witch or something  years ago.  It's just some old, old clip of her saying she went on a date and the guy was a witch. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, on the politically incorrect.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so now people are like, we can't vote her in her office.  She might worship the devil.  Yeah, yeah.  Bill Maher is like fucking saying shit about her, which is...  She a Republican?  I guess so.  Of course.  What were we just saying before I interrupted myself?  What happened with Gene?  So Gene flips the page and he shows me a bag, like a drawing of a bag with a dollar sign  on it.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  And I was just like, right on.  What is that?  He goes, see this?  This is going to make me...  This is my future.  This is going to make me a billionaire.  And I said, what is it?  And he goes, nobody ever thought to copyright the dollar sign on a money bag. 
[02:26:00]  So I did it.  So I was like, really?  Can you just do that?  Can you do that?  And I guess you could, but it's kind of a dick move.  Isn't it in every cartoon where there's a crook?  But he said at a certain point, like, it was a couple years it would kick in, that if  Monopoly wanted to show, you know, money bags running around holding the money bags,  whatever that character's name on the Monopoly game, they were going to have to cut him  a check or something.  Holy shit.  It's kind of weird.  It's like squatting, like cyber squatting. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, it really is.  Like, hey man, you know what, Earl, I bought sex in the city of the movie dot com.  You know, it's like, why would you do that, dude?  Like, well, rainy day.  Never know.  All right, so let's see.  Oh, let's hear nasty, Gene.  Not a gentile mouth.  Ooh, maybe it's a discussion we can have.  Yeah, okay.  But let's not start something we're not going to finish.  Right.  But in terms of the, what was the question about makeup?  Oh, did you like being covered up by makeup and did it make you feel less vulnerable or,  you know, less like Gene Simmons, Gene Klein, or your birth name? 
[02:27:00]  I don't feel covered up any more or less than any girl feels covered up when she wears makeup.  The makeup is simply an extension of a personality.  And colors, clothing, makeup all express something.  And getting up on stage was a chance to sort of live out the, oh, I don't know,  sort of a scream therapy meets a rock and roll band version.  I wanted to put together the band I never saw on stage. 
[02:27:30]  I wanted to be in a band that gave bang for the buck.  I wanted to be in a band that didn't look like a bunch of guys who, you know,  should be in the library studying for their finals.  You know, I wanted stars up on stage.  And regular people just didn't look big enough.  So we wore eight-inch platform heels, put on more makeup and higher heels than your mother,  and made more money than your banker.  It all kind of works out.  How can you make rock and roll sound that boring and paint by numbers?  He's just like, so we decided. 
[02:28:00]  It was a logical progression.  Yes.  It really sounds natural and organic.  We could cut to the chase.  E-Rock just sent in all the highlights where they go at it.  Well, we'll start with this track, talking about money.  Or was that it, maybe?  I don't know.  Let's start here.  Are you trying to say that all that matters to you is money?  I will contend, and you're trying to disprove it, that the most important thing as we know it on this planet and this plane is, in fact, money.  You want me to prove it?  Go ahead.  The first thing you need besides air, which so far is free, and by the way, if you went scuba diving, you're paying for air. 
[02:28:30]  The other thing besides that is food.  It's what we need to survive.  I don't know what other tool I would use besides money to buy it, although, as a woman, of course, you have the ability to sell your body, then get the money, and then with that, get food.  But ultimately, money is part of it.  You are weird.  Really?  How do you get food?  Well, not by selling my body, but...  But that's a choice you have that I don't. 
[02:29:00]  See, that's what started, right?  Yeah, right there.  And then...  That is the most inane logic I've ever heard.  It's ridiculous, retarded, obnoxious.  He can't be real.  It sounds like the kind of conversation you would have when you were, like, 15, 16.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of thing.  You want me to prove it?  You want me to prove it?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Prove it.  First of all, he's not proving anything.  You're giving your take on something.  It's more like, I think you've given an example.  Yeah, an example. 
[02:29:30]  How about people that just live in the mountains and hunt?  They trade sex for food, apparently.  Sex for food, yeah.  Or fuck their food.  Yes.  You could fuck a moose and then eat it.  Is there more?  Oh, yeah.  It gets way better.  There's a bunch, right?  That's just the beginning.  Look at the chase.  How much money do you have?  Gee, a lot more than NPR.  Oh, I know.  You're very defensive on money, aren't you?  No, I'm not.  I'm actually just trying to show you that there's a big world out there, and reading 
[02:30:00]  books is wonderful.  I've certainly read, well, perhaps as many as you have, but there's a delusional kind  of notion that runs rampant.  Wait, can we just get something straight?  Of course.  I'm not here to prove that I'm smart.  I'm not here to prove that you're not smart or that you don't read books or can't make  a lot of money.  This is not about you.  You're being very defensive.  Why are you doing that?  Oh, God.  He's a passive-aggressive cunt.  Fuck Gene Simmons and his fucking asshole.  Isn't that weird?  I hate him.  Kiss Alive 2 is fucking great.  What an album. 
[02:30:30]  What an album.  Destroyer.  That's all that's about it.  All you have to do is separate the work from the man.  Exactly.  That's all that matters.  You can still dig the work.  I mean, because it wasn't just him.  It's three other guys.  God.  And it continues here.  Now, let's get to the studded cod piece.  Do you have a sense of humor about that?  I mean, does that seem funny to you?  No, it holds in my manhood.  Otherwise, it would be too much for you to take.  You'd have to put the book down and confront life.  Not everyone wants to fuck you, Gene. 
[02:31:00]  He's talking about the book, too.  He's like a real anti-intellectual or something, because he keeps ribbing her for reading.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  He's like, if you put down a book and suck a cock, you'd know what I'm talking about.  He's like, what are you talking about?  He's such an asshole.  The question is that if you want to welcome me with open arms, I'm afraid you're also going to have to welcome me with open legs.  That's a really obnoxious thing to say.  No, it's not.  Why should I say something behind your back that I can't tell you to your face?  Has it come to this?  Is this the only way that you can talk to a woman to do that shtick? 
[02:31:30]  Let me ask you something.  Why is it shtick when all women have ever wanted, ever since we've crawled out of caves,  is why can't a man just tell me the truth and just speak to me plainly?  So if I do that, you can't have it both ways.  So you really have no sense of humor about this, do you?  Oh, I'm laughing all the way.  Oh, to the bank, right?  Well, of course.  Don't I sound like a happy guy?  Not really, to be honest with you.  I was going to suggest you get outside of the musty place where you can count the dust particles falling around you 
[02:32:00]  and get out in the world and see what everybody else is doing.  Having sex with you?  Well, if you chose, but you'd have to stand in line.  Oh, stop it.  Who wouldn't fuck the God of Thunder?  I submit a lot of women would love to have their pussy eaten by that tongue.  The God of Thunder.  Who wouldn't?  Saying he's fucking phenomenal.  I think he's got a lot of pussy, or is that a shtick?  Of course he is.  No, I think he's got lots and lots and lots of pussy.  But he's been with that one broad forever. 
[02:32:30]  He said that they've had an open relationship, I thought, no.  I think half of what he says is complete bullshit, and the other half is exaggeration.  Him and, what's his name, Sharon Tweed?  Shannon Tweed.  Shannon Tweed.  They've been together for years and years.  However, they have this open relationship.  But I think that was just shtick and a fucking, you know, a publicity stunt thing.  Well, can I ask this?  I think during the heyday of Kiss, yeah, the guy probably got a fuckload of pussy.  Yeah, but fuck that.  Like, the Family Jewels is the name of the show. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, the fake scripted fucking show.  Well, that's what I'm asking.  Like, that show's been on enough.  Do they show Gene, like, chasing other women, actually having sex with other women?  It's so fake.  No.  Seems like a normal, regular household, but they're not officially married to me.  Right.  The little I've seen of the show.  Great reality show, second only to the Osbournes.  Oh, it's terrible.  Shows of the inner workings of a rock star's life.  I watched one episode the other day just because I criticize it all the time, and it's so fake. 
[02:33:30]  Like, you know this didn't happen.  And I like the fake people that come over the house to do work or something, and they're actually really angry, yet they signed the fucking release, and they're not so angry where they're leaving.  That's the thing.  Every time you see somebody blow up on a reality show, it's like, just tell yourself, they signed a release.  They signed a release.  No matter how mad they may seem in this moment, they were okay with it getting there.  Yeah.  Or maybe they signed it beforehand.  Gene would do that because he's smart.  I'm not defending Family Jewels just because there was a roast and I happen to be a part of it. 
[02:34:00]  Who cares?  You're not doing it.  Is there more?  Gene.  Oh, there's more.  Thanks.  One of them leaves.  If I remember correctly, I think one of them leaves.  Yeah.  I think we're getting to that point.  Let's see.  Are you interested in music?  Don't you love this interview?  Tell me the truth.  Well, I think it's kind of a drag.  Because you're making speeches and you're being intentionally obnoxious.  No, I'm not.  I'm being a man.  That's what I mean.  You're being intentionally obnoxious by defining everything that you're saying as being a man. 
[02:34:30]  Well, I can't talk.  I know better.  I know all men.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, I always define it the way that you're speaking.  You're wrong.  I always define it as, for me, I kept doing that over and over again.  What bothers you is you're finally hearing a man tell the truth.  Instead of, you're the only one I'll ever live with and you're the, he's lying.  He's lied ever since he was 12.  I promise I'll pull out.  He's lying.  And I refuse to play that game.  I refuse to stand up in front of a rabbi and my friends and the woman I love, who I will 
[02:35:00]  tell you I can love with all my heart, and promise that she's going to be the only one  I will ever have until the day I die.  That's a lie.  I'm watching the luckiest girl in the world right now.  This is the girl that's, is that really him?  That's Gene, yeah.  For sure?  And that was after the interview.  That's Terry Gross.  I like the fact Gene's pants are still on and he's kneeling on the bed and he still  has his pants.  She won't kiss, though.  Look, she won't kiss.  Nah, she don't want to kiss.  She keeps trying to kiss and she won't kiss.  She's like pushing his face away. 
[02:35:30]  And he's got his t-shirt on still and his wig.  Oh, is she trying to kiss him?  His wig?  That's a wig?  I don't know.  I mean, you've got to think something's going on.  I'm delighted to see someone else fuck with a shirt on this.  You never see that.  I feel like I'm not alone.  Maybe I do have something in common with Gene Simmons.  Well, you don't think she wanted to kiss?  Wow.  No, she doesn't.  It says up there, it says, in one alleged, Gene Simmons puts on a condom before entering  his lady friend who then refuses to kiss him.  The reader may draw his or her own conclusion. 
[02:36:00]  My conclusion would be?  She's a hooker.  She's a hooker.  Yeah, that would be my conclusion.  Usually the non-kissers are hookers.  That's my conclusion.  That's what I've heard.  That's where they draw the line.  Yeah, kissing for them is very personal.  But oddly enough, we just saw her shuffle to the edge of the bed and take his dick in her  mouth.  Yeah, right.  So weird.  Didn't she hear a condom on at first, though?  That, to me, is what gives away that I think she's a hooker.  It looks like there's a condom on his dick.  Yeah, well, he did.  It says he puts it on.  Before the blowjob, though.  Yeah, that's true.  Regular girl doesn't put a rubber on before she fucking blows you.  So then who is?  Do you think this is her place?  Yeah, yeah.  He wouldn't have the camera hooked up. 
[02:36:30]  It's probably her hotel.  Or her place.  So he probably didn't know what was going on.  Oh, no.  No.  Hence Gene's secret.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's keep going with this interview here.  Terry Gross from NPR.  I like what she said.  Because it's a drag.  Yeah.  It's kind of a drag.  Do you like the movie Spinal Tap?  And do you think that's...  Oh, that's a tough question.  I mean, at this point, if you're Terry Gross, though, you're grasping at straws.  Because this dude has kind of like just been the un-interview.  That's what... 
[02:37:00]  So maybe she's trying to take it to the insult level.  That's a lazy question.  Like you were saying earlier, though, I'm thinking.  True.  Do you like the movie Spinal Tap?  And do you think that Spinal Tap has any comment on...  Rock and Roll?  Sure.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  I think it's all funny.  I mean, when you really think about it, I'm not delusional enough to think that what I  do is important to life as we know it on this planet.  No.  But neither is what you do.  You know, the world can get along very well without us. 
[02:37:30]  Farmers are more important.  Teachers and firemen and so on.  Because if they're not around, it really affects us.  Your job and my job, whether you wear less makeup and I wear more makeup, is to entertain  people.  And I'm here to tell you, I'm very entertaining.  I don't know about you, but this is NPR.  He's got a real bug up his ass.  It's like NPR killed his parents or something.  He always has a bug up his ass.  It doesn't matter what show he does.  He thinks people look at that like, wow, look at Gene. 
[02:38:00]  He's really getting the most of everybody.  He just comes across like a dick.  Tell Kevin the Jill story, too.  That was very telling.  Oh, when he did that, yeah.  When I was going out with Jill Nicolini, the traffic girl, Gene was doing an interview  over there, and she was doing the entertainment segment that day.  And then Gene was coming over here.  So he gets done over there, comes over here, and he starts saying shit like,  you know, oh, how about I just, you know, fuck your girlfriend or something. 
[02:38:30]  I think you told me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was like right in your face.  He was right in my face.  And I didn't know that he knew anything about us having a relationship or something like  that.  Right.  So I didn't know he was being that personal.  And then I find out later on that he was like pinning her in the corner of the studio saying,  yeah, why don't you come to my hotel tonight?  And like she was getting pissed about the whole thing.  And then him coming here knowing, because he said, you know, she said, oh, you're going  over to open Anthony. 
[02:39:00]  Anthony's, you know, me and him are going out.  So he knew.  And even knowing, sat in front of me, looked me right in the eyes, and completely just  fucking disrespected me like that.  Yeah, no doubt.  On your show.  Like, I'll fuck your girlfriend.  Maybe I'll just do that.  Like, and if he was just like, like the generic, like if it was just a goof, like he didn't  know my girlfriend, he didn't know, whatever.  But the fact that he knew he was just trying to like pull one over on me or something.  Well, it sounds like he likes to go into every interview scenario kind of the way he did 
[02:39:30]  with you.  Yeah, yeah.  With Terry Gross as well.  How weird is that?  Nike Town, which is a huge store on 57th Street here in Manhattan, is closed because of  bed bugs.  Bunch of people.  Lady Gaga's rally on gays and military.  Lady Gaga has bed bugs.  We got that.  She's not even dressed so poorly.  She's dressed kind of normal.  Oh, God.  There they are, dude.  The bed bugs.  Nike Town's got the bed bugs.  In Nike Town, there's a bed bug orgy going on.  A lot of guts being fucked.  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  I mean, look.  Ew, that's what it looks like, dude.  How can you not see that?  I know.  You're buying all that new stuff in there and bringing home bed bugs.  Pointy dicks.  Look, and they're under the, is that, ah.  How many bed bugs does the store have that they have to close it down until further notice?  They closed one in, they closed a Victoria's Secret here in New York as well.  Oh, it's the worst.  For the same reason.  Really?  Yeah.  Could you imagine?  You bought some panties, put them on, they're like.  Somebody, somebody used to work there before the.  At Vic's Secret, the same one they closed?  You got some inside dope? 
[02:40:30]  Oh, boy.  No?  Bed bugs.  No bed bugs.  Did you say, and bring them home and put them on, Kevin?  I said, if you bought panties, you came at that Victoria's Secret.  Okay, I wasn't sure.  Take them home, put them on.  You're like, ah.  Imagine, you come out of the dressing room, you've had them on your face for a little while.  All right, let's continue with this Terry Gross thing.  Almost over.  What exactly is NPR in your mind?  I never knew.  It always sounds like a sixth grade school teacher.  See, if I was in charge, give me the reins, I would get National Public Radio. 
[02:41:00]  And people start.  I actually agree with him.  That's fair.  Then why is he on there doing an interview?  Because he's going to change the world.  He can't just rebel from the outside.  You've got to change it from within.  Get in there.  Yeah, you've got to get in there.  He's showing us the way.  He certainly is.  People start snoring.  I'm not questioning the content.  You should have bright people on.  Maybe you should never have me on again if you don't think I'm bright.  Clearly, it should be a wonderful place for people who read and are bright to have a conversation, 
[02:41:30]  a discourse perhaps without hearing whatever it is you hate about the outside world.  Fine.  How about some style?  Give me a little spice instead of this blend.  You ever see the Saturday Night Live version?  It's pretty spot on.  Have you listened to it enough to know if it's spot on?  Sure.  I was in Los Angeles and did a quick one.  P.J. O'Rourke, who's great, who wrote for Rolling Stone, was on with myself and one 
[02:42:00]  other gentleman, I don't remember, and the instructor, you know, the teacher, sorry, the  DJ guy gets on, good afternoon, Gene, going, what's the matter?  Why are you talking like that?  What do you mean?  He's going, you know what?  Let P.J. talk.  P.J. the DJ.  You need, as a listener.  I would beg you guys to get, because he doesn't have an affected voice of his own.  I was going to say, with his monotone fucking, that's a character he's playing, crap, yeah,  he's just, well, here we go, blah, blah, blah, blah, it's the same fucking thing he's 
[02:42:30]  doing.  He's such an ass.  I would beg you guys to get something else on the air.  Something with, I changed the call letters, NPR, I changed it, give it some oomph, Lexus,  Locus, something, see?  Not a fan of NPR, but I think they do pretty well, right?  Yeah, they do very well.  I think they're fine.  They're very profitable.  They have a gazillion listeners.  They have more listeners than anybody, if I remember correctly.  So they're doing something right.  Every fucking cab driver in New York listens to them. 
[02:43:00]  Has it on.  Every cab driver.  And that's nationwide, NPR as well.  And I think it's boring, too.  I hate listening to it.  I think it's terribly dull, but it's great when jeans are on.  I'll tell you that much.  Then why is it so successful if it's so dull?  I don't get it.  I don't know either.  Some people like dull.  I think it's talk that's kind of, it's not, nobody's screaming at them.  Right.  It's more conversational.  Screaming at them, yeah.  It's not offensive in that way.  The type of thing you can listen to when you've just come from a fucking clitoral circumcision 
[02:43:30]  in the sedan.  Now you're driving fucking.  The calm voice.  The soothing voice.  Now you're driving me to the airport.  Okay, five in the morning.  All right, let's get through this.  Gene is too into himself.  I think he should.  You said you don't have sympathy for that guy on the roof who keeps saying, I'm going  to jump.  But my impression is you don't have much sympathy for anyone.  You're so into yourself.  Well, that's so true.  You're just so deep into yourself.  I think everybody should be.  If it sounds like admiration coming out of you, I accept it. 
[02:44:00]  I think life is too short to have anything but delusional notions about yourself, which  is you should really like yourself more than you deserve to because the alternative isn't  very good.  You should really think you are better looking than you are because the alternative is sort  of, you know, some bad notions.  And so I'm aware as the same person that I'm not the best looking guy in the world.  I'm aware of it.  But when I go into a party, I will walk out with your girlfriend.  See, there you go. 
[02:44:30]  It's like, you know what?  No, you won't.  Exactly.  Not this decade.  I walk out with my girlfriend and me.  Where are we going, Gene?  Yeah, Gene.  We're going to listen to records.  I'm going to fuck your girlfriend.  Just clueless about the whole thing.  I'll walk out with your girlfriend.  Really?  And I'm walking out with both of you.  Let's go to McDonald's.  Yeah.  And with duct tape and a fucking gun, he'll walk out with a girlfriend.  The interview ended this way. 
[02:45:00]  Just one more question before we wrap up.  I would like to think that the personality you've presented on our show today is a persona  that you've affected as a member of KISS, something that you do on stage and before  the microphone, but that you're not nearly as obnoxious in the privacy of your own home  or when you're having dinner with friends.  Fair enough.  And I'd like to think that the boring lady who's talking to me now is a lot sexier and more  interesting than the one who's doing NPR, you know, studious and reserved.  And I bet you're a lot of fun at a party.  Well, we'll leave it at that. 
[02:45:30]  Gene Simmons, thanks so much.  I look forward to our meeting.  Bye-bye.  They're both right.  Yeah.  They're both right right there.  But she wasn't being shitty to him.  She wasn't.  She was just doing who she normally was.  She was being herself, doing what she was doing.  She hung in there.  Exactly.  She did.  I was always kind of impressed that she was able to.  Yeah, she hung in there.  She would have given him a lot of leeway, I think, if he would have just been nicer at  one point.  I think she would have been very, very courteous.  He was just so hostile and so coiled spring.  Yeah, yeah.  And so like, you're wrong about that. 
[02:46:00]  It's like, I don't even think you guys are arguing, really.  Yeah, there was no need for an argument or some kind of hedge-butting.  It just sounded like he was feeling kind of bad about himself, and he told his publicist,  put me on NPR so I can say a lot of cool things about me.  Yeah.  I'll talk about me.  All right.  Let's go to the phones.  We asked people to call with questions to Kevin Smith, and they've been holding for like  a half hour or so.  Tom the Trucker in Canada.  Tom?  Morning, guys.  How y'all doing?  Hi, Tom.  We got Kevin Smith in studio.  Yes.  Hey, Kevin.  I just want to give you a big prop there for coming up to Brantford and supporting the 
[02:46:30]  Walter Gretzky Foundation.  That guy's like a, you know, he does more in Brantford than what Wayne does.  Oh, yeah, God, yeah.  It was, thank you, yeah, back in June.  It happened first time last year when I was out here shooting a couple of dicks, which  became cop-out.  Went up to Brantford, Ontario, and played in the Walter Gretzky Street Hockey Tournament.  And we went back this year as well, and this year we broke the record.  We went for the Guinness Book World Records of the most registered teams in a street hockey 
[02:47:00]  tournament.  It was held by, I think it was a ladysmith out in Vancouver or something like that.  And we won it.  We kind of spent like February till June driving it, kind of online and interviews and whatnot.  And we wound up breaking the record like handily by about 30 teams, 30 members of a team or  something like that.  30 more people.  And all we needed was a number of teams, which we'd beat that handily as well.  How many teams played?  I think we had to get 195, and I think we were at 207. 
[02:47:30]  217.  217 teams playing over the course of a weekend.  But it was cool.  And it got into the Guinness Book of World Records.  So, or at least they sent all the stuff over to him and Guinness was signing off on it.  So I thought it was kind of cool.  Walter Gretzky is a really cool dude.  And, you know, he's the son of Wayne.  I mean, the father of Wayne Gretzky.  His son is the greatest hockey player to ever live.  But this dude has spent so many years just giving to his community and to Canada.  He's largely regarded as Canada's dad.  So it was kind of a nice thing to be like, let's put him in the record books. 
[02:48:00]  His son has enough fucking records.  Put the dad in the record book.  Did you go to his house or anything?  I did.  And it's awesome.  Where Wayne grew up?  Yeah.  At the Variety Avenue house.  They still live in the same place.  And you go, they take you down into the basement and they hit you with bricks.  No, you take you in the basement.  And it's just like a fucking museum.  It's like the Hockey Hall of Fame.  And he keeps everything.  And it's not just Wayne.  It's all the kids.  Sure.  So you see all these trophies from when they were all kids playing whatever, gymnastics,  baseball, hockey. 
[02:48:30]  And then at a certain point, you just start seeing more and more of Wayne's.  Wayne, man.  Oh, wow.  I got a memory.  I was working in Rochester, New York, and I forgot about that.  Wayne's brother was supposed to be the next Wayne Gretzky.  It never happened, obviously.  Yeah, yeah.  What was his name again?  I forget.  Ted Gretzky.  Ted Gretzky.  I think he played, I guess I don't know much about him, actually.  He did play, and there was definitely the kind of like, will he be the next great one?  Yeah, and he was fine, but he wasn't Wayne, yeah.  And it's the same house Wayne grew up in?  Yeah.  Did they add on to it or anything with all that Wayne Gretzky money? 
[02:49:00]  They did.  They added on.  Yeah, they added a bit on to it.  Knocked down maybe the neighbor's house and say, beat it?  No, they just kind of built out.  We need your space.  And then they put a pool in the backyard, because when he was, you know, the legend is when he  was growing up, his dad froze the backyard, and that's where he learned to play hockey,  and they have all this footage of the backyard rink and stuff.  So now it's been replaced by a pool.  There's no more kids to, you know, put the rink out for anymore.  All the grandkids are kind of grown up and whatnot.  And so I guess he put a pool in for him.  That is so cool.  So that was weird, being in the backyard and being at the edge of the pool and just knowing  that the kid who would become the world's greatest hockey player in the world, like 
[02:49:30]  literally would just take shot after shot for hours at a time.  Right there.  Right there.  It was kind of cool.  I don't get really, you know, verklempt about that kind of thing, but that one I was really  like emotional about.  I was like, oh, it was amazing being at a crossroads of history in some way.  Do they still have his room set up?  No.  Lots of him, but they kind of, his room has gone off.  Imagine how creepy that would be.  That would be strange.  But yeah.  He left it just like he left it.  Yeah, we don't want to touch it. 
[02:50:00]  We just want to honor Wayne's memory.  I'm like, he's alive.  Yeah, right.  His brother's name is Brent?  Or is Brent?  Brent Gretzky?  Yeah, he's got a face.  Thanks, Danny.  Brent, there's another brother as well.  It's a key.  But I think Brent's the one that played.  Let's say hi to Andy in Cleveland.  Andy.  Hey, guys.  Kevin, I wanted to ask about Widening Gyre.  Yes, sir.  It's a great book.  Thank you.  Can you help us out?  Widening Gyre.  This year, I did a Batman miniseries for DC.  Last year, I did one called Cacophony. 
[02:50:30]  This year, we did one called The Widening Gyre that I did with my friend Walter Flanagan.  And it was six issues long, and then the sixth issue just came out, I guess, maybe two months ago.  And it was kind of a big shocker, spoiler, big shocker ending.  Right.  And then with the next volume of it, six more issues starting pretty soon.  Right.  But I took some heat for it, though, because there's a sequence in it where at one point, Batman's telling a story.  He's trying to, like, give some confidence to this younger vigilante who's been hanging out with him. 
[02:51:00]  He's kind of training, an adult, not a kid this time, like Robin, more of an adult.  So the whole arc of the miniseries is about how he has to learn how to trust.  He doesn't know how to deal with people.  He knows how to be Batman around people.  He doesn't know how to be a human being around people.  So slowly, this guy's kind of working into his trust level and whatnot.  And he sees that this guy's feeling badly, like he's not going to be nearly as good as Batman is at this kind of crime-fighting thing.  And so Batman's like, you know, to himself, he's like, just give him something.  Give him a little something more.  You know, say something for once. 
[02:51:30]  So he tells the dude a story about the first time he used explosives on one of these gigs.  And it was a moment from Batman year one, very kind of famous moment where he blows open the wall of, like, all these corrupt city officials.  And he's like, ladies and gentlemen, you have eaten well.  You've eaten Gotham's soul.  Your meal ends tonight.  Just scaring the shit out of everybody.  So in my story, I said, you know, same thing happened.  But since it was the first time he used explosives, he wasn't used to the intense heat that was going to go off and the impact from the wall being blown out. 
[02:52:00]  And when it happened, a wave of heat hit him really hardcore, knocked him kind of for a loop a little bit.  And he had what I referred to as a bladder spasm.  Uh-oh.  You would not fucking believe the amount of people, dude, who wanted my fucking blood.  They're like, you, how dare you make Batman pee?  Batman can't pee.  Batman would never piss.  He doesn't pee.  Meanwhile, Batman in the comics at that point was lost in time.  He was fighting pirates and fucking cavemen. 
[02:52:30]  But I said he had a bladder spasm.  And you would not believe the amount of people that were just like, you're a fucking idiot.  How dare you?  You ruin this.  How could you ruin Batman like that?  It lasted.  It was two dudes.  Two dudes on the internet feeding one another.  It lasted for about half a day, just as quickly went away.  But there was a moment where it threatened to kind of take away, like, the ending of issue six was really, really fucking cool.  It was a real shocker.  But that moment, like, these guys really wanted to kind of like, oh, fuck that.  This book is horrible because of this.  One of these dudes was like, this is the worst comic book page ever printed in history. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, holy shit.  In the history of comics.  Just because, like, and I didn't even say that he pissed.  Like, he was like, I had a bladder spasm.  Right.  And I talked to, like, a friend of mine's a firefighter.  He's like, dude, yes, that happens.  That's what would happen.  Yeah, yeah.  But these people, they're like, it wouldn't happen to Batman.  I'm like, Batman, he's not real.  That sounds.  He's not real.  It sounds exhausting to argue that stuff.  Oh, dude.  It really does.  I argued for about three minutes.  And I was like, what am I fucking...  Well, I'm talking about...  Why am I arguing with people who are fucking not getting laid? 
[02:53:30]  Sure.  Fuck this noise.  Yeah.  That's funny, man.  Let me go to Tom in Ohio.  Tom?  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to say, Kevin Smith, I think your movies are awesome.  I've been watching them for a while now, and I used to date this girl.  I'm not sure.  She said she was related to you.  She lives in Northeast Ohio, but she's the one that got me turned on to her movies, and  I just want to say that they're the greatest things out there, and you're one of the best  interpreters around, and I look up to you, and I think you do a great job. 
[02:54:00]  Thanks, man.  I totally appreciate that.  Can I share something with you, dude?  There's a picture here on the computer, which is awesome.  It's Batman, and he's got like a...  He's reading a note, and it says, Dear Batman, I came in your mask.  Regards, Robin.  How great is that?  He's got a wide-eyed expression, like you son of a bitch.  Thanks, boys.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for the props.  What's your favorite movie, Tom? 
[02:54:30]  The original Clerks.  It's awesome, man.  Thanks, man.  And don't take any shit from those Southwest geeks, man.  Never, sir.  Never.  How much did it cost you to make Clerks?  $27,575.  Which was a lot of money, though.  I guarantee it.  That's insanely well-spun cash, man.  Still, to this day, it's like 15, 16 years later, and somebody stole Clerks, which is good  on one hand.  On the other hand, it's like, you haven't done anything as good as Clerks.  But it's like, how do you feel about the theory that when you're directing something, 
[02:55:00]  you should tell the story visually, and the dialogue should spice it up?  Or do you think the dialogue should write the story?  One of those guys.  I've always been the other guy.  You're the dialogue guy.  Yeah, because visuals don't occur easily to me.  Only more recently in life have I kind of started concentrating more on the visual aspect  of telling a story in film, which is weird because it is a visual medium.  But up until recently, it's always been more like dialogue first.  And how about conflict?  Every story has to have conflict?  Not really.  It just depends.  I mean, most stories do. 
[02:55:30]  Otherwise, they don't really go anywhere.  But I'm not one of those dudes that's just like, I need three acts and a conflict.  I just kind of have an idea for a conversation, and I build everything else around there.  Start with the dialogue for me.  Because somebody was saying recently, no, some things don't have to have conflict in them.  But it's like, I can't think of one thing I've ever seen.  It doesn't have to be between people.  It could be between a guy and himself.  I can't think of one.  Well, they say there's three basic stories in the world.  There's man versus man, man versus environment, man versus himself.  You forgot man versus tranny.  That's one that a lot of people have battled. 
[02:56:00]  To the death.  The eternal struggle.  Let's say hi to Tim in Connecticut.  Tim, got a question for Kevin Smith?  Hey, Kevin.  I was wondering if you had purchased any more massive televisions lately.  All right.  What was the one you bought?  I have a 103-inch television.  I didn't even buy that one.  That was given to me by Panasonic.  God bless him.  I don't think I could ever, in good faith, spend as much money on a TV as that TV.  Because I think when it came out, it was like $70,000.  Wow.  And unless it had a fucking steering wheel and a motor on it, I don't think I could justify  that purchase to my wife. 
[02:56:30]  103-inch.  But they gave me one for judging a contest, I think it was.  Wow.  And I love it.  The wife hates it.  She calls it the nuclear sun.  Because it's so bright.  She's like, we can't go to bed, dude.  There it is.  It's just like.  I forgot it's in your bedroom, too.  It's so fucking mad.  And it sits literally like three feet from the end of our bed.  That's so bad for your eyes, isn't it?  If it is, I don't care.  Look at the rest of me.  It's kind of shit.  We don't care about the eyes, Jim.  But I love it.  I lay on the bed on my belly just like this.  So I'm like two feet away from the screen. 
[02:57:00]  She can't stand it.  I'm trying to get away from that.  We're trying to turn on the AC as much as we can for you, Kevin.  The thing is great.  Here's the story that's going on here.  Kevin is really hot.  I'll say.  A little warm, man.  It might be that jersey.  I'm fanning myself.  I'm fanning myself like an old black lady.  My fingertips are numb.  You're freezing.  Because the air coming out of there is about 30 degrees.  And look at me.  I got goosebumps.  I'm freezing sitting here.  You want to switch?  I'm getting hit with this, too.  It's cold coming out of here. 
[02:57:30]  I'll come over here.  We'll be fine.  There's none for me.  Meanwhile, I'm waving a magazine.  I love the hockey jerseys, but they just don't breathe.  See, I go the other way, which is, like, I wear this during the summer because it breathes  pretty.  I mean, this is micro mesh, so it's pretty, it's not as heavy as the other shirt.  It's not as bad.  I don't know where to go.  Everyone wants to talk.  Blown BP oil well, now permanently capped.  That's a happy piece of news.  Oh, yeah, especially since someone bought stock.  Yay!  Yay!  Oh, I was capitalizing on dead pelicans. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  What were you doing?  How?  Explain.  Once the stock dropped and the bottom fell out.  You just started buying.  And I still realize that this is a company that makes a fuckload of profit every quarter.  They make billions of dollars.  Once this whole thing passes and it gets off the news and people forget about it, it's  going right back up.  It's going right back up.  So I bought a fuckload and I'm waiting.  Price today of oil is up, so.  Yeah.  So you still haven't made?  Oh, I've made some cash on this one. 
[02:58:30]  Me too.  Playing the markets and whatnot?  Yeah, you just fucking throw some in your E-Trade account and fucking buy and sell.  It's as simple as video poker now, isn't it?  That's what it is.  Yes, it is.  That's dangerous, man.  I don't think of it as anything but gambling.  Like, I'm not like, well, let me buy some blue chips and hold on to them for a while.  No chip.  I look at it as, you know, yeah, it's like playing online poker.  Your future.  You're freezing over there. 
[02:59:00]  That's my stuff.  Oh, a little angel.  Now your mosquito bite is bleeding.  You all right over there?  It's a mosquito bite.  It's a bed bug bite.  It's a bed bug.  No, I swear.  It's a skeeter.  A bed bug was fucking your bicep.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I hope that fucking...  You guys can turn the AC off if you guys are cold.  Mercer doesn't...  No, no, no.  It's fine.  You fanning that actually makes the cool air go on me, too.  I'm in a great spot here.  I like it.  You are.  You're in the Nexus, man.  Perfect storm.  I feel like Caligula.  You should be feeding any grapes.  Blind Stevie's coming into the studio with the fan for Kevin Smith, I believe. 
[02:59:30]  And he's having a magazine in my hand.  It's totally fine.  No, Stevie walked right across the studio.  He doesn't know where it is.  Right into an elevator shaft.  I'm good, please.  No, you don't even have to bring in the fan.  This guy is the most blind he could be without having a German Shepherd.  Yeah.  How you doing, Stevie?  You know Kevin Smith?  Hi, sir.  Do you know which one he is?  I've heard his movies.  Poor little fucker.  Stevie, say hi to Kevin Smith. 
[03:00:00]  I did.  We did.  He was working, yeah.  All right.  I got to hold the fan because I'm plugging this fan in.  You're not making this fucking dude hold the fan on me, are you?  That would be great.  This is horrible.  Let's make him hold the fan.  How great would that be?  Stevie, why don't you just hold the fan?  Yes, it was a great idea.  Bring a Negro for Kevin Smith.  Put it down.  Don't let him talk to you in the same way.  You're not going to make him hold the fan, are you?  He's standing there holding the fan.  I feel bad for him. 
[03:00:30]  Stevie, why did you shave your head?  Oh, wow, he did.  Yeah, get on mic.  I figured it was time, you know, to...  Keep the fan on.  No, talk through the fan.  Talk through the fan?  Yeah, you know how you get that effect that we all tried as kids?  Can you do that?  I'm trying to make a stand on it.  All right.  I figured it was time.  No, that's not how you talk through a fan.  You're fucking fanning the microphone while Kevin Smith is...  It's so hot.  But you told me to talk through the fan.  From behind.  From behind.  Okay.  And then you sound like, what was it, Darth Vader it sounded like or something? 
[03:01:00]  No, it's just a little choppy.  All right.  All right.  It's not working.  No.  Yes.  Obviously, the bit's not going to work.  Let's just move on.  Bit just fell apart.  Oh, my God.  And no one admitted.  I figured it was time to get a haircut, so I figured I'd do it yesterday while I wasn't  coming in.  All right.  All right.  You sound like Babe Ruth right before he died.  Enough with this idiot in the fan.  Put it down and go fucking drink poison.  There you go.  Yeah.  Just put the fan close to Kevin Smith so he can get some relief. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  I'm good, sir.  Thank you.  Why are you putting the fan down to his ankles?  My cankles are boiling.  Can you put that fan down there?  I'm feeling very hot.  I got the vapors on my ankles.  All right.  You better just hold it.  That would be better.  Holding the fan.  What are you doing?  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to make it stop, though.  It's like moving on me.  Well, repeat after me.  Lodi, your show is hot, Mr. Smith.  You really look a lot more like Bobby now from King of the Hill. 
[03:02:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  With the short hair.  With the short hair.  You're really.  Yeah.  I've gotten that before, so.  Oh, you have?  Yeah.  Have you ever, well, I was going to say, have you ever seen the show, but.  How about we put the fan down?  Yeah, it is weird.  Yeah.  It is weird.  Yeah.  I'm good, sir.  I got the fan.  Thank you.  I'm a fan boy.  Get it?  What do you mean?  Oh, he didn't.  Kevin, it's very uncomfortable.  How about you put it in the, put it on the chair or something. 
[03:02:30]  I'm going to start acting like Gene Simmons all of a sudden.  Why don't you be a little creative and clever?  What are you doing?  You said the chair.  Put it on the chair.  Yeah.  Yeah, so what, which chair?  This chair.  You're supposed to be a think on your feet kind of guy.  I'm embarrassed.  I'm trying to be, but I mean.  What would you think would be the best way to have that air hit Kevin Smith without you  holding the fan?  Go.  That's all you got to do.  Put it down?  I don't know.  I'm not asking you to answer me.  I'm just saying do it. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Figure out a way where you could put the fan.  Did he put it on the floor again?  He's about to.  He is fucked.  Now, aim it.  Is that good?  Aim it at Kevin.  Yeah, put it up.  Just put it up a little higher so he gets hit with the fan.  Just lift it up high.  Do it.  No, can you aim it up?  Oh.  Jesus.  You're panicking.  Is that good?  Kevin, you feel that?  I'm totally good.  I left this conversation 10 minutes ago.  I'm now just knee deep in life and style weekly. 
[03:03:30]  He really does.  You guys do what you need to with the fan.  Kevin just bailed.  Yeah, he's perusing a gardening magazine.  And I don't blame him.  Did you guys, anybody watch the VMAs by any chance?  A little bit, a little bit.  A few minutes.  Did you see Cher come out at the end?  Yes.  He looked good.  A little rough, huh?  Really?  Yeah.  From where I was sitting, it didn't look bad.  Again, my seats must have been bad.  Wearing that, what was it, from the old video?  Yeah, from the, yeah.  It was the only time of the night, the whole time I took my kid. 
[03:04:00]  And the whole time of the night, I kept turning over the kid going like, who's that?  Who's that?  Everybody that came out, I was like, I don't know any of these people.  I felt like an old man lost on the train.  I was like, I don't know anybody here.  Somebody get me home.  You know what?  She looks exactly the same.  She looks the same, man.  When she first wore the outfit.  Yeah, she doesn't look bad.  Totally.  But that was the only time of the night where somebody came out and my kid turned to me  and was like, who's that?  I'm like, well, that's Cher.  Let me tell you why.  I know this one.  She looks like a male, female impersonator of Cher.  She's tall, man.  But she hasn't fucking aged.  That's a 20-year-old outfit. 
[03:04:30]  Because she's dead.  They just keep wheeling her out.  Like a vampire, man.  She doesn't have to poop anymore.  And you need a coat?  Nah, I'm good.  You want to wear my sweat jacket?  No, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Let's go back to the phones.  Everyone's waiting to talk to Kevin Smith.  Oh, of course it's a wig.  But he has to have Gene Simmons.  I want to make Chinese food in his hair.  Gene Simmons is a wig?  Oh, my God.  He has to be.  So what's under it?  He wants to go walk.  I think there's a picture of bald Gene Simmons, right?  Yeah.  Danny will find everything. 
[03:05:00]  Is he bald?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He's an older guy.  He did it.  It was for something.  I'm sure he has some hair.  Yeah, no.  That's him just shaving his head.  That's him.  It was shaved for something.  He was shooting something.  He has a nicely shaved head, though.  He doesn't look creepy bald.  He looks like...  Yeah, I think I got indentations in my head.  I ain't looking forward to the shave.  I got liver spots.  My head's a mess.  Do you have liver spots?  Like Mr. Burns and shit.  I just slugged fucking on my head.  Three little dots on your head?  It's creepy.  Excellent.  Oh, my God. 
[03:05:30]  All right.  Let me say hi to Darren.  Darren, what do you got for Kevin Smith?  Is this the first or second Darren?  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  Old joke.  Darren.  Sergeant was the second one.  Huh?  Dick York?  Dick York.  He was a good one.  And then the other one was Dick Sergeant.  Both named Dick, too.  Yeah, very odd.  That's actually how I was named.  Get out of here, really?  Yeah, dead serious.  So your family's a big fan of Bewitched?  Yeah.  My brother was named after that, too.  After Bewitched?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  What's that?  And I have a brother named Quinn after Quinn Martin Productions.  Get out of here, man.  Big TV watchers.  Big TV watchers.  Quinn Martin Productions.  Epilogue.  Jesus.  His sister, Epilogue.  Yes.  His daughter, Quincy.  The girl.  My brother Scott was named after an astronaut.  You know which one?  What's your brother's name?  Scott.  Is it Neil A.?  Oh, probably Scott Carpenter.  That's why I'm asking.  Yeah.  Scott Carpenter.  Yeah.  Original Mercury 70s.  Jesus.  All right.  What do you got for Kevin Smith, Don?  I wanted to ask Kevin what he thought about some of the new superhero movies that are coming 
[03:06:30]  out, like Green Lantern, Captain America, Thor, stuff like that.  I saw a bit of Thor at Comic-Con, and I could care less about that character, but that footage  looked great.  Like, it actually looked like it might be a cool movie.  Really?  The other one's running around wearing those gigantic costumes.  Who's playing Thor?  It's a dude who played Kirk's dad in the opening of the new Star Trek movie.  Oh, in the opening.  Yeah.  Okay.  The one who gets killed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:07:00]  All right.  Spoilers.  Yeah, right.  Spoiler right there.  You haven't seen Star Trek yet.  What was your favorite superhero movie of all time, Kevin?  Mine?  I think Dark Knight, hands down.  That was great.  Oh, yeah.  I love Dark Knight.  I can still watch it.  It's still popping in.  That's the first one, right?  The first.  No, that was the second one.  Batman Begins was the first one.  Oh, right.  I love the one with Heath Ledger.  You like that one?  Oh, yeah.  I like it, too.  Although, Heath Ledger was amazing.  I don't like Christian Bale as Batman.  You don't dig him, man?  Nah, I'm not digging him.  He's, he's, for me, he's neutral.  Jimmy doesn't like this part. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  I talk like that.  That's the weird thing.  It's fucking terrible.  It hurts my throat.  I was like, Jimmy Garanti.  He must have friends.  He was doing that in the Terminator movie, too.  He was doing that.  He yelled the people.  He had that whole thing.  It's like, he doesn't talk like that.  What the fuck is he doing?  Cha-cha.  Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.  But I liked that movie a lot.  I thought they nailed it.  I thought that, and it also played more like a cop movie than it did like a superhero movie.  He just happened to be a cop in tights or something.  That's what it felt like.  Yeah, that was a good one. 
[03:08:00]  I don't know.  We had the discussion last time about his head hanging out the car door.  You know what a great moment that was?  Just amazing.  Just enjoying the fresh air.  Yeah, fresh air.  Just amazing.  Just having a kid moment in the middle of all this mayhem.  That and when he looks over his shoulder when the motorcycle goes by, when he's trying  to kind of commit suicide by cop.  That's a great shot.  It was well shot, that movie.  Yeah.  Oh, very.  I don't know where to go.  But I look forward to that.  I look forward to Captain America.  I mean, who doesn't?  Who's playing him? 
[03:08:30]  The guy who played the Human Torch.  What's his name?  Richard Pryor?  And somewhere, the young Jimmy is giving a shout out to Richard with that one waving at  the camera.  Casey's watching.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Check it out.  The new comic.  Chris Evans is his name.  And then what was the other movie he said?  He said Erica.  Oh, I don't know.  Green Lantern.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah.  I'm all for it, man.  I'm all for seeing that, too.  Jesus.  That character, to me, has always been kind of, I don't know, it's one of those impossible 
[03:09:00]  characters.  Like, when you write for Superman, it's like, how do you write for the character that can't  be harmed, except by one thing?  Yeah.  You know, it's like, you know where your story's pretty much going to go at any given moment.  Green Lantern, the guy has this ring that essentially, whatever he thinks or wishes,  the ring does and makes.  And in the comics, that's historically a giant boxing glove, punching villains and stuff.  So his imagination kind of limited.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:09:30]  But this is the one that they've been talking about for years.  And now that CGI exists, that they could actually pull this character off and make shit from  his ring.  It's going to be just a green guy with a gigantic cock.  Exactly.  That's the whole movie.  I'm getting compliments.  The real Green Lantern.  He gets this amazing ring from space.  He's like, this is what I use.  It's two hours of women saying it's the biggest cock I've ever seen.  Of course.  And the credits roll.  All right.  We got a tough question coming in.  John in Virginia.  John.  Here we go.  Hey, Kevin.  How are you, bud?  How are you, sir? 
[03:10:00]  Good.  Hey, back in 96, my wife died in childbirth having my son.  Jesus.  And three or four months after that, a friend of mine brought a DVD down and it was Clerks.  And it was the first time I laughed.  And I laughed through the whole goddamn movie.  And you just hold a special place, man.  You can do anything.  And you never do shit, but you could do shit.  And I would still laugh at it.  But I wanted to let you know, it was funny when you did Jersey Girl.  I was just going to say, like, oh, man.  That's, yeah.  I feel like there's a weird connection with you. 
[03:10:30]  I never met you.  I don't go on the computer and blog with you.  But, brother, it just, you helped me out a lot not even knowing it.  I appreciate that so much.  Let me ask you a question.  So your wife died in childbirth?  Yes.  How long before you started getting back on the horse, so to speak?  Because Dave Anson in the Newsweek, like, in Jersey Girl, the conceit was Jennifer Lopez died in childbirth having Ben's kid.  They're characters, not them.  And then seven years later is the first time he hooked up with Liv Tyler.  And I remember David Anson in Newsweek was like, that is patently unbelievable. 
[03:11:00]  He's like, that could never happen in a million years.  And I remember he actually gave me the benefit of doing this kind of sit-down piece with Newsweek.  Like, instead of just writing a shit review, he sat down and did a dialogue piece where he's like, I don't like the movie and here's why.  Now, would you like to talk about it or defend it?  So that's kind of what I did.  And my point to him was like, I don't know, dude.  Like, I'm crazy about my wife.  She dropped dead.  I'm not going to start fucking, like, right away.  I don't even know if I, it might, seven years is conceivable.  He's raising a daughter. 
[03:11:30]  He's like, he's in the fucking suburbs living with his dad.  Where's all this pussy hitting him from?  Seven years.  I'd get blown in the limo on the way home.  Hey, look, before you run the car back, I already got to have the suit cleaned.  But he did.  He really took me to task for that.  He said it wasn't.  It wasn't long enough?  Seven years?  Absolutely unbelievable.  He said nobody would wait seven years to have sex.  Yeah, that's a long time.  And then I said, well, David, what if your wife died?  And he was like, I'm gay.  And I was like, okay.  Never mind.  Right?  You got me there, dude.  All right.  So, John, that's the question. 
[03:12:00]  How long?  Well, I would say it was less than a year.  Wow.  I wore my wedding ring.  Right.  And then I was in a band.  And I remember my drummer and singer, we were after a gig, talking to these two chicks.  And I walked up and they said, oh, well, you're married.  I said, no, actually, I'm not.  I'm a widower.  My wife died having my son.  And the pity pussy started.  I was going to say, my God, it must have just jumped into your lap.  I mean, that's the way the universe corrects itself.  It's the least it could fucking do for you.  You poor thing.  Yeah, no doubt.  Yeah, it was awesome. 
[03:12:30]  I mean, well, I mean, you know, I mean, look, I was devastated.  Of course.  And I still think about it every day.  I say, my son's 13.  But, yeah, man, the wedding ring, first of all, I never knew that wearing a wedding ring,  you get more pussy than if you're single.  That's what they say.  That's never.  If you're a widower with a son and a golden retriever puppy, I just walk down the street  with a T-shirt and a boner and get sucked into your lap.  How the hell is this guy doing?  He's got all the fucking tricks.  I have a new story.  I'm just going to buy a ring now and fucking wear it. 
[03:13:00]  You're what?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I lied.  George Carlin, when I first met George Carlin, we were talking about doing Dogma.  His wife had just died.  And they've been together for years and years and years.  And the only request he had about the script, about doing the movie,  was he's like, my wife just died.  I was wondering, I can't take this ring off yet,  so I'm going to put a Band-Aid around it and see if that's cool.  My heart broke.  I was just like, that is so beautiful.  What a lovely sentiment that he's just not quite ready to commit.  Even in as much as I'm just on the set for a couple days, 
[03:13:30]  he didn't want to take it off.  He just put a Band-Aid around it.  That's love.  What was her name?  Brenda.  His wife's name was Brenda?  Brenda Carlin.  Okay.  Because he signed a photo.  I have a photo with him and he signed it?  After Brenda died, there was a chick named Sally  who he was with for a while, I believe.  Sally Mann.  Not Sally Mann.  That was a chick with a dancing fan.  Sally.  I forget her last name.  Did she die as well?  I don't think so.  Okay.  Because he put like an S period, J period after his autograph.  It's really weird on the photo that I have with him. 
[03:14:00]  Right.  He signed it and he put an S-J.  I wonder what her last name was.  Stupid jerk for you.  He was like, I heard you gave a shout out to Pryor in your youth.  What about me?  Where's my wave?  I was so uncharming.  Yeah, I was never very good in school.  Really?  Faggot?  Tell us more.  Uncharming?  Oh, I was fucking awful.  Behind the music.  All right, John.  Thanks for the phone call, buddy. 
[03:14:30]  Thanks, man.  Yeah.  What a good guy.  Yeah, right on.  What a good guy.  Isn't it nice to know that the fucking universe took you?  I know, really.  At the top, you're like, oh, man.  I know, I know.  But I mean, the universe corrected itself.  It's like it took something really important from him.  And they're like, well, we can't give it back, but we'll do some of this.  And he's laughing his ass off at clerics after that happened.  Imagine that.  Probably like uncomfortably hard for everyone around him.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, oh, look, he's laughing.  Ah, ah, ah.  We're all going to laugh.  Laugh.  Laugh.  Laugh. 
[03:15:00]  That fucking De Niro and Cape Fear laugh.  Yeah.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hands in the back of his head.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Everyone's just sad.  Oh, what a sad thing.  It's got to suck for any kid that, like, your mother dies.  13 years without a mom.  You think there's guilt there?  But then you get that guilt thing.  For the kids?  It's got to happen.  I mean, I don't know.  Like, if it happened to me, let me try.  If I was responsible for my mom's death and childhood, no, I don't think so.  Yeah, it's just a thing of nature.  Yeah, it's just like, I had nothing to do with it. 
[03:15:30]  I mean, you know, you just hope your father never gets mad at you one day.  He's like, you fucking blah, blah, blah.  Then again, kids blame themselves for divorce.  Yeah.  It's not always logical.  And then you've got to wonder if your dad kind of resents you a little bit because you  were having a great old time.  And then, you know, kid comes out, no more good times with a wife.  I think it makes you go the other way, where it's just like, this is the last piece of  that person you'll ever have, is that kid.  You can't fuck it, though.  Good point.  Good point.  You can, but it's not spoken unfavorably at all. 
[03:16:00]  You can, but why would you want to?  Oh, Anton is logic.  I think it's leaking.  Let's take some leaks and continue with Kevin Smith.  The big news today, Kevin came in to announce that he's doing the Smodcast for us now.  Yes.  Which is really good news.  We're taking it here on the virus.  We're taking it here on the virus.  Yeah, yeah.  One exclusive new show a month, and then they play a bunch of the other ones that we've  been playing for years now.  Which is awesome, because those shows are great.  Thanks, man.  And we'll have promos on the channel to explain the whole thing for you.  So stay there.  More with Kevin Smith. 
[03:16:30]  The Virus Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. & Anthony Show.  On the bell tolls.  On the bell tolls.  It's time to call. 
[03:17:00]  You know, Kevin's done our show a lot, and it just hit me.  We've never talked music with you, have we?  No, not really.  I have a pretty shitty musical taste.  Oh, you do?  But they just kind of stopped at a certain point.  I don't really listen to anything all that new.  A lot of 80s shit, a lot of Run DMC, a lot of Public Enemy.  Lately, though, I've found myself going back to the 70s tunes.  All the songs that I hated when I was a kid, that my parents would play, or I'd hear on  those K-Tel commercials, now that's what I listen to in so many of them. 
[03:17:30]  So you, growing up in music, not so much?  Nah, not really.  But right now...  I hate live music, too.  I can't...  Really?  Yeah, you can't hear the lyrics, man.  That's the...  I'm a word guy, so all you ever hear is, like, instrumentation.  That's fine, but I like hearing the lyrics.  Last concert you went to?  I think it was, um...  I mean, do you count shit like high school musical?  I had to take the kid to that high school musical concert. 
[03:18:00]  But, I mean, for me, I think Liz Phair is the last time I went out to see.  I saw her play, I think, at the Spider Club in Los Angeles or something.  But she was...  Even her, she was lost in the orchestration, the music itself, without hearing.  I couldn't hear the dialogues.  I was like, why am I here?  Oh, that's kind of hard to grow up.  Kind of hard to grow up not being into music, though.  Yeah.  I mean, well, I grew up in Jersey, so we had music given to us.  She's like, you have Springsteen.  Right.  And then later on, you have Bon Jovi. 
[03:18:30]  Right.  So we were instructed who to like from an early age.  For Jersey, that's about all you're allowed.  Yeah, totally.  And my father was a big country and western fan, so there was a lot of that playing in  the house.  So that kind of takes you out of the music mix right there.  It really does.  And it's not like, you know, you could put in your Kiss album.  Yeah, yeah.  You'd be like, take that off.  I didn't even have a Kiss album.  My father was like that, too.  I know.  You had a bunch.  Oh, yeah.  Growing up, my father was into country, and it was just the oddest thing.  Do you remember names from your country youth, like Charlie Pride? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, there was all those guys.  You remember that name, right?  The Silver Fox.  Yes.  Tom T. Hall.  Oh, my God.  All those names from my youth, man, that I would see and hear all the time.  Every once in a while, they come up, and you're like, oh, my God, I haven't thought of that  name.  Yeah.  Who was the one that would go, oh, how they love to talk?  He says it.  Was that Charlie Rich or Charlie?  Maybe Charlie Rich.  He says his K is too hard.  Wall.  I like old school country.  I can't name much of it.  Take the ribbon from your hair. 
[03:19:30]  I don't know.  Take the ribbon.  That was one.  And he stopped loving her today.  He plays the wreath upon a door.  Always in my father's room.  Real loud.  I never understood it when I was a kid, but I listened to that song when I grew up.  Sad.  What was my old man doing in that room?  Why would you listen to that music?  All those songs are so fucking just sad.  But he had a pretty happy life.  He had a wife who dug him.  It's not like he had some lost love, but he listened to all that fucking music.  I never quite understood why. 
[03:20:00]  We went out to California.  Me, my brother, my father, and my father's like chick at the time.  And it was in a Pinto, in a fucking hatchback.  Not even one of the longer Pintos.  And four people, 3,000 miles in a Pinto, with him just blasting his eight tracks of country music.  So in the middle of the, you know, the track would change.  I remember that.  No one knows what goes on behind those doors. 
[03:20:30]  There it is.  Yeah, it would end.  Like a song would sometimes end in one of the tracks, and then it would track over to  the next track, and then the song would ramp up again.  Yeah, they couldn't time it out, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But why couldn't they figure that out?  That seems like something they should have been able to figure out.  Say fucking eight tracks.  What the hell are they doing?  I know, but come on.  At that point, they were just like, hey, man, we put music on this tape.  That's a miracle.  Yeah, that's an amazing point.  What, are you going to take a record player in your car, motherfucker?  All right, good point.  But yeah, it's so weird, like what you would tolerate, and now, if somebody did that to 
[03:21:00]  you, like we're going to break up your track.  Oh, yeah.  What?  You're out of your mind.  The, uh, I never thought we'd get any further than the cassette player in a car when I had  like that, and you've just popped your cassette in, and then they had the...  The fancy ones would flip it inside.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My friend Ernie O'Donnell had that.  He had that.  He put it in his truck, put the tape in, it would self-flip, but then one day it stuck, and  we can only listen to the Blues Brothers soundtrack for the next three years. 
[03:21:30]  You said that in, uh, the cop-out, uh, commentary.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Totally.  I thought that was a great story.  It's true.  It's like where I, it's like I learned to drive Ernie's car listening to, to, uh, fucking,  uh, Bruce Willis.  No, Bruce Willis.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, I got to bring this up, because I, I swear, I love the, the, uh, the commentary  on the cop-out.  Uh, you had one of your childhood friends play a scene with Bruce Willis because of  that cassette.  Ernie, that guy.  For that thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ernie, uh, Ernie O'Donnell.  Can you tell that story, old fan?  Absolutely.  He's a friend of mine growing up for many, many years, and, uh, he always wanted to act. 
[03:22:00]  He's way into acting and whatnot.  So he's popped up in the movies over the years.  He was in Clerks.  He's the guy who's like, I'm a trainer.  He's the guy who's giving Dante shit about lifting up the milk and whatnot.  So, uh, going into this, going, I mean, there was, honestly, when I got the job to do what  it was called a couple of dicks, then it became cop-out.  Once Bruce Willis was cast, there was only one person in the world that I wanted to talk  to.  It was Ernie O'Donnell.  It was the only person who I knew would be more excited than me. 
[03:22:30]  Everyone else was like, oh, good for you, man.  Bruce Willis, that's kind of cool.  But I knew Ernie would be like, you're kidding.  Like, cause that was, we, I drove, he taught me how to drive in his truck listening to fucking,  Bruce Willis' album, you know, the Respect Yourself album.  The Return of Bruno, it was called.  Right.  So I gave him a shout and I was just like, uh, we're doing, I'm doing this movie, dude.  I'm doing the next movie.  Uh, I said, I got to tell you who's in it.  And he's like, who?  And I was like, Willis.  He goes, get the fuck out of here.  I said, even better, dude, you're going to be in a scene with him.  He was like, get the fuck out of here. 
[03:23:00]  And he came up and he's the guy in the sequence with, uh, Sean William Scott.  They robbed the house.  Right.  Jimmy knew where I was going.  The, uh, yeah, the card store.  The card store.  Isn't that wild?  All based on the cassette.  You're a stupid cassette player.  I know, right?  Stuck.  Those are the worst when you just hear it start grinding away in there.  Or slow down just for a split second.  When was the last time you listened to a cassette and heard that hiss?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The cassette hiss.  And they couldn't figure that out when they flipped it too. 
[03:23:30]  Because sometimes you'd have the end where it was just dead air for a while.  Because the other side had to make up for it.  Had to be a little bit longer.  Yeah.  A little longer.  But then they figured out how you could fast forward right to the next song without trying  to figure it out yourself.  But that, no, that was hard too.  Because you keep...  That was more home units.  They would look for the three second guy.  Right.  Yeah.  And then it would stop horribly.  Right.  And you would think it was going to split it.  It was so hard to try to figure out, like, I want to hear a certain song.  I'll put this in.  I've got to fast forward it on the other side.  Wait a minute. 
[03:24:00]  No, if I put it this way...  Fuck, I can't find this song.  It would piss you off.  God, we're old.  It just sucks.  There was a report I saw.  You guys probably did it at one point.  But there was some report, news report, came out a couple weeks ago where they were talking  about all the things of a class entering high school right now, I guess, is the class  of 2014.  Oh, shit, yeah.  And so they were saying these are the things that the class of 2014 has no concept of and  are not familiar with.  Number one, they've never twisted the phone cord while they were on the phone because they've  never lived in a world with phone cords. 
[03:24:30]  Number two, they have no idea what this means when you tap your wrist because nobody wears  watches anymore.  Everyone has their clock on the cell phone.  It was a list of all these things.  I was like, that's fucked up, man.  Like, shit that...  I want to see this list now.  We didn't do this bit.  Yeah, it's common.  It's all the shit that you do and all the shit you are used to.  Take for granted.  Cassettes.  It doesn't exist in their world at all anymore.  Like, there are some people that, like, one of the things...  Yeah, there it is.  The Beloit College...  Remember dubbing cassettes when you had the dual cassette player?  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  And you were able to put it in and make it, yeah. 
[03:25:00]  Twice the speed.  Twice the speed.  Skip down to go too well.  Yeah, that's...  I just found a bunch of my old stand-up cassettes.  I used to tape every set, and I wanted to know how to put them on digital so I can goof  on them.  You can't do it.  Here we go, man.  Number 32, Czechoslovakia has never existed for the class of 2014.  Get the fuck out.  Number 41, American companies have always done business in Vietnam.  If you're graduating in 2014.  Number 58, Beethoven has always been a dog.  Strange. 
[03:25:30]  You know what's funny?  Beethoven always been a dog is just as important as never having seen Czechoslovakia.  Exactly.  It's right there on the same list.  It's irrelevant.  It's a weird list, though.  There it is, man.  There's a full list right there.  All the ones worth mentioning.  Few in the class know how to write in cursive.  For these students, Benny Hill, Sam Kinison, Sam Walton, Burt Parks, and Tony Perkins  have always been dead.  Ooh, that's fucked up right there.  Email is just too slow, and they seldom, if ever, use snail mail. 
[03:26:00]  Al Gore has always been animated.  I guess since 92.  Is that the year they said?  If you were...  Yeah, born in 92.  Born in 92.  Yeah, that's fucking...  Caramel Macchiato and Venti Half-Calf Latte have always been street corner lingo.  Jesus.  John McEnroe has never played professional tennis.  Clint Eastwood is better known as a sensitive director than as Dirty Harry.  Oh, Jesus.  Dr. Kevorkian has never been licensed to practice medicine.  This is all shit that's happened since 92, dude. 
[03:26:30]  That's not that funny.  There it is.  They never twisted the coiled handset wire aimlessly around the wrist while chatting on the phone.  Jesus.  Cop Killer by rapper Ice-T has never been available on a recording.  Wow, was that yanked?  They yanked, remember?  Oh, yeah, they yanked that one.  And they still have never reissued it.  Wow.  You can still get it somewhere, right?  Yeah, probably online, I'm sure, but you can't go into a store and buy it, though, unless  you're going into, like, a fucking second-hand store.  Who's going into stores and buying anything?  Yeah, I was going to say, oh, that doesn't really exist.  If I like a song...  That's the thing you see on the bus, dude, crossing the country, how many fucking malls 
[03:27:00]  are abandoned and empty?  Yeah.  Like, just malls are just going under, man.  Just kind of like...  Who's going out?  Because everyone's buying their show.  I like to go to an Au Bon Pain with a young lady.  Coffee and a croissant, perhaps a good conversation.  I never knew how to pronounce it.  No, until just now.  Au Bon Pain is a wonderful place for a young couple in love to go and get them to know each  other a little bit and talk about their fears.  Over a turkey sandwich. 
[03:27:30]  A turkey sandwich served by some Indian lady.  And then you're...  This is the best of France.  Do you notice if movie theaters, too, are kind of dropping off?  I mean, I know movies are still grossing a lot and everything, but, of course, the price  is going up and shit like that.  I haven't seen too many, but it almost seems like a matter of time, right?  Because more people...  Especially with, like...  Have you seen the Netflix streaming technology?  Yes.  Where you can literally watch a fucking movie on your phone and it's streamed in 20 seconds. 
[03:28:00]  It's there.  I know.  It's right there.  And it's crystal clear.  It's like watching a DVD.  And that's right at the beginning of that technology right now.  No doubt.  So, if you're doing that, you're going to be able to do it at home way quickly.  But there's still always going to be that element of, like, let's go out.  Just like the theater never died.  To go out.  Movies, I don't think, will ever die.  Yeah.  People still like going and having that collective experience.  But you can't have the theater in your house.  That's it.  Live.  You can't have a movie.  And the better home theaters get, the better surround sound gets.  You put a couple of bad incidents.  Bed bugs.  I keep finding bed bugs in movie theaters. 
[03:28:30]  Right.  You know what I like?  A couple of chasing them.  I like fucking paws.  I like drinking beer if I'm sitting there and watching a fucking movie.  I don't want to be a slave to people that are sitting in front of me.  Man.  Man.  I think really the movies are fast becoming the domain of the young because you're right.  You get to a certain age, you're like, I want to build my perfect movie watching environment.  I can do it in my house for, like, less than five grand or something like that on a low-end scale.  At that point, you can make the choice to be like, I don't want to deal with that shit anymore. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  Teenagers and kids, though, they'll always go to the movies.  Kids, because parents just need something to have them do.  Yeah.  Teenagers just get the fuck away and suck cock and make out.  Yeah.  I like your pop.  I remember getting a handjob at the premiere of Friday the 13th.  Which one?  The very first one?  Yeah, the first one.  And it actually first came out on Friday the 13th.  It was actually by the actress who played Mrs. Voorhees.  Mrs. Voorhees.  Oh, it was great.  Straddling your dick, calling it Jason. 
[03:29:30]  Save my boy, Jason.  Come, mommy.  Come, mommy.  I thought you were going to say it first came out during the previews.  No, no.  It came out on Friday the 13th.  It's actually the date.  The movie or your fucking watch?  My watch.  The date they put on the bottom of the screen was Friday the 13th of that year.  And I was like, wow, I'm sitting here on this date.  Oh, you're watching the movie and suddenly you're sucked into the reality.  Yeah, it was like, wow, that's...  And then broken into the reality because some chick's like, yeah. 
[03:30:00]  Presumably some chick is giving you a hand.  It's a great story.  Yeah, it's a fantastic man.  Well, any handjob story in a movie theater.  Absolutely.  Beats I had my ass finger during Stardust Memories.  That's fucking great.  Because that was so scary, that movie.  Friday the 13th.  I knew what happened at the end.  My friend Jonathan Blatt told me.  Ah, scumbaggy spoiler alert.  Didn't matter.  It still scared the fucking balls off me.  But isn't it weird how they just dropped her like a bad habit for the second one on? 
[03:30:30]  That was it.  Like, she was the villain of the first movie.  It wasn't Jason Voorhees.  Which is that great, true question that people are asked.  You know, who was the killer in Friday the 13th?  Yeah.  And everyone says Jason.  And no, it's Jason's mother.  It's Jason's mom.  Well, maybe they realize a dead guy back to life with a hatchet's a lot more interesting  than a woman who probably is a lesbian who's overacting.  Yes, kill him, mommy.  Great hairdo on her, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Her fucking very outdoorsy shoes and tough-skinned pants. 
[03:31:00]  I never thought about it.  Do you realize the great thing is that even though Jason was born and became a monster  after he drowned, somebody stuck their dick in Mrs. Voorhees.  That was the most horrifying part of that.  Dumb Jason couldn't swim.  Everybody has to die.  Oh, fuck.  I never thought of it that way.  No.  Swimming lessons would have just negated that whole series.  If that dude could swim, that'd be it.  Or little swimmies.  How could nobody...  For $1.99, there's no Friday the 13th series.  And Jason lived happily ever after. 
[03:31:30]  How is that bitch so strong?  That's how you know she was dyking when she was grabbing heads and sticking knives.  There's no way...  She killed Kevin Bacon, man.  He was in that, wasn't he?  What are you doing?  He was in Nightmare on Elm Street.  No, I thought Johnny Depp was Nightmare on Elm Street.  Oh, Depp, I'm sorry.  I think Kevin Bacon was Friday the 13th.  Oh, what are you doing in this?  He gets stabbed through the bed, I believe.  Oh, wow, okay.  Did you just question Kevin Smith on his movie knowledge?  You could, you could.  I'm getting old.  Shit slips, dude.  I don't...  I can't say that I know for sure, but I'm pretty sure...  Danny's pretty good with horror shit.  Yeah.  Is this the ending?  Yeah, it is. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, this was fucking...  That's her in the boat, right?  Can you turn the volume up?  Not that you have to hear much.  Oh, nice.  And you didn't see this coming, too.  This is how movies ended.  This is a Carrie ending.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because that was like the first one that really just...  Where her hand juts up at her.  Well, here you felt safe because you're like cops.  Yeah, yeah.  So everything must be okay.  And the old lady's dead, so what could possibly happen?  She just is crazy in a boat.  The end.  Roll the fucking credits.  We're done.  But the music is more masturbatory than anything else, right? 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  You feel like she's going to touch herself.  Yeah.  Oh, she's all happy.  You know, when the chick was making this movie, she's like, I'm going to be huge.  Oh, damn.  Yeah.  That is fucking horrifying.  That still made me go a little like, eh.  When that happened in the movies, oh, and all that place just went bullshit.  I don't understand, though.  Did she...  What happens in the reality of the movie?  And why is he a little boy there and a fucking man in the next movie?  I don't know.  Because they probably figure a little boy walking around, killing everybody would be silly. 
[03:33:00]  I think she might have been dreaming that.  I don't know.  Was she?  I don't remember.  Does it keep going?  I know in charity.  Does she wake up or no?  Why a hockey mask?  Why all of a sudden a hockey mask and a hatchet?  Well, they didn't do the hockey mask until I think...  Third one.  Third one.  Yeah, the second one, he had a sack on his head.  Oh, did he?  He probably called silly.  Everyone was challenging him to races at camp.  That was a movie they were working out in front of us.  Every movie.  Like, wait a sec, the killer's a woman.  No, it's a little boy.  No, it's a big man on the back. 
[03:33:30]  No, it's a hockey mask.  They absolutely did.  Motherfuckers.  What was the scariest movie for you, Kevin, of all time?  Let me see.  I mean, I still think those two little girls from The Shining will unnerve me no matter  where I am in life.  That does just...  And still haunts me like if I turn any corner, there's always a piece of me going, it's going  to be two little creepy British dudes.  Why the fuck are they scary?  They're not ugly.  Because you weren't expecting it.  And they were so creepy and calm. 
[03:34:00]  And you realize they were dead and they had been slaughtered.  But now here they are inviting a boy to play.  I think it's that...  And they're talking and they're synchronized speaking.  That's always scary.  Like, come play with us.  And the music and the fucking Kubrick shot of that...  Like, yeah, look.  Look at...  Look, just look.  Oh, come on.  Will that just fuck you up?  And what's really weird is you remember them as twins, but I don't think they're technically  twins.  And they were not in the book.  Well, they were naughty girls, though, trying to burn the place down.  Where do you think these chicks are now, man?  That's what I always think.  I would love to know what they're up to.  Come and play with us, Danny. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah, I...  Look, where do you think we are?  We got killed by Delbert Grady.  Delbert Grady, of course.  Yeah, but technically they did steal matches and try to burn them.  What was he supposed to do?  Live with that?  He had to correct them.  I'm shining girls now, he wrote.  That was a good call, man.  This is a dude who surfs the internet a lot.  Danny knows.  Danny knows.  Kubrick got the idea of them from a photo he saw of two girls that looked like that.  That's why he put them in.  Stephen King hated the movie because he's an idiot.  The movie was scary.  Well, that was one of those rare instances where the book is brilliant and the movie is 
[03:35:00]  also brilliant.  But they're two very different things.  That rarely happens, you think?  Yeah, I mean, yeah, very rarely.  Is it where both stand there as their own kind of unique entity?  Carrie did both.  The Carrie book was scary and the film was scary, but not as scary as the book, I don't  think.  But was it close?  I didn't read that.  I don't remember, but I think so.  But in the book...  Remember in the beginning, he was always mad that everyone was screwing up his shit,  and then he directed one himself and it was dog shit.  Oh, and it was horror.  It's terrible.  Like anything he was involved in directly, unless it was just... 
[03:35:30]  Maximum Overdrive, which we all wanted to see so badly because he had a green goblin  head on the front of the truck.  And we're like, this is amazing.  Oh, this blows.  The dude got killed by a toaster.  It was about electronics turning on people.  He did The Shining.  He redid The Shining as like a miniseries and it fucking ate balls.  Oh, with fucking the dude from Wings.  That's the dude that they're like, your agent calls you.  And they're like, hey man, there's a lead role up for grabs.  You're like, fucking A, man.  Steven Weber.  Fucking A, I would love to do it.  And they're like, you're playing Nicholson's role in The Shining. 
[03:36:00]  Wouldn't you just be like, fuck off?  There is a no-win scenario.  I don't know if there were craft service on that movie.  That's the Kobayashi Maru of fucking movies.  It is, it is, man.  You cannot win.  And Weber didn't figure out a way to fucking break the machine.  Reprogram the test.  Well, in the book.  Are those the girls?  No way.  Yeah, they're kind of...  Take it from VH1's Where Are They Now?  They're a little scarier now.  Yeah, they're high.  They definitely look scary still.  Oh, shit.  What happened?  They must be around our age, man. 
[03:36:30]  Because I remember being around the same age as those girls.  I wonder if they still hang out together.  You think they just lurk in hallways?  Yes.  Like, hey, remember us?  Come play with us.  And no one knows them.  But they're older now.  I'm trying to get through here.  Fuck our mouths forever.  Did you say dirty stuff?  What a great porn team that was.  The one on the right looks like the lady that got out of the tub later on in the movie.  What a fucking buzzkill that was.  You got ugly fucking Shelley Duvall and Bag of Bones upstairs.  You're going to fuck this hot chick and it's an old dead lady? 
[03:37:00]  Oh, drat.  I love the...  When I saw The Shining in the movies, though, how hot was it when an English chick first  gets out of the tub?  Yeah.  Big, hairy fucking 70s bush.  Which in the 70s, we didn't call 70s bush.  No, it was just called pussy.  Yeah, we're like, look at her pussy.  Yeah, pussy is great.  Meanwhile, if you took somebody from today, back then, they'd be like, what pussy?  Where are they?  Where's the pussy?  I don't see the pussy.  Like, it's behind that giant mat.  It's called a pussy because there's hair on it, dummy.  That's why it was called a pussy.  Not anymore.  Yeah, there she is, a fucking English chick. 
[03:37:30]  Where is she today?  Oh, my God.  She probably does look like she looks like the older version, probably.  That was really creepy, too.  It was so fucking scary because the doors open, there's a lady in the tub.  It was probably Brady's wife.  Do you think that's who it was meant to be?  Double Grady's wife?  No, she's way too hot for Double Grady.  You think Brady was fucking that?  Come on.  Maybe a young version?  Rubbing some avocado on her pussy and licking it off.  I just assumed she was some person that had been killed there earlier or something.  Oh, maybe she was.  Yeah, that's true.  They never said much about the Grady wife, except in the book he talked about her. 
[03:38:00]  I put on a fucking little bunny ears and I wanted to blow my friend and go, that's  my favorite scene.  That is.  That's fucking awesome.  There's a shout out to that in Red State.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  That was one of my favorite moments in a movie ever, is that fucking snap zoom to the dude  leaning up after blowing the guy.  He's ashamed for a couple of reasons.  He has a lousy costume and he's sucking a dick in an abandoned hotel.  I didn't want anyone to see this.  Why would he leave the door open?  Close the door if you're going to suck dick in a dog costume.  It's like my dad always says. 
[03:38:30]  Leah Beldum, that's her name.  Who, that lady?  The younger one.  Yeah, Danny's close.  I bet your tits are fucking so juicy, though.  When that old bag is laughing and then they have that shot of her just slowly sitting  up in the tub, that is a fucking creepy-ass scene.  Yeah, it's a very, very...  I think that might be the scariest one.  The Exorcist was a horrifying movie, too.  Oh, my God, yeah.  You know what the scariest part of The Exorcist was to me?  Was when he's having that dream and he's trying to tell his mother not to go down into 
[03:39:00]  the subway.  Right.  But it's silent.  It's silent, yeah.  That was fucking...  And that fucking demon face is flashing.  And the flash demon face.  That was a woman, by the way.  In the frames, was it?  Yeah.  I've been trying to squeeze that into a conversation for four years.  Oh, fuck.  What the hell was that, Danny?  Yeah.  I'm getting scared.  I know.  I'm getting scared.  Would it have sucked, though, if he went into the...  Nope.  I thought I had a joke, but I don't.  Did you guys see there was an ad that they did for, I want to say, like BBC, and they 
[03:39:30]  were doing some kind of Stanley Kubrick week or something like that, showing all his movies.  But they did this tracking shot like this.  They reenacted the entire set of The Shining and did a long Kubrick tracking shot from the  back rooms onto the stage across the fake snow.  But they had to reenact the whole thing.  Wow.  It was pretty astounding, man.  It was kind of cool.  That sounds like a lot of work.  It really was.  My job on the film would have just been to type out, Tuesday, that was going to flash  on the screen.  Dong.  That was a great fucking part of that movie, too. 
[03:40:00]  Just like cutting with a dong.  You can play a handball in that giant room.  Yeah.  You just hear him the noise.  You're like, what is it?  And you just see him whipping that ball.  I hear Kubrick was crazy with focus, getting everything complete, and it would just take  him fucking forever.  He was one of those multiple takes guys.  Ever.  Yeah, with like a thousand takes.  I used to say Fincher's the same way.  Yeah.  People say Fincher is such a bear for detail, and multiple takes.  I was talking to somebody who was doing some job on our flick.  I think it was a sound recorder.  I think it was a guy with a boom mic. 
[03:40:30]  And I was saying, we ain't got a lot of money, dude.  So trust me, we ain't going more than two or three takes.  He's like, so you ain't going to Fincher this?  And I was like, what does that mean?  And he's like, oh, I was going to Fincher, man, with the takes.  I was like, what do you mean?  He's like, 40, 50, easy.  Holy shit.  That's weird.  How do you pull through all that?  But that guy's like a true artist.  What does he direct it?  He gives a shit about that.  What does he direct it?  The one coming out now is The Social Network.  He did Fight Club.  He did, what else has Fincher done? 
[03:41:00]  Alien Resurrection.  Alien 3?  Yeah, it was 3, the third one.  I heard Kubrick took like 80 takes to get Scatman's face when he's being summoned by the kid.  Like that, when he's shaking his head.  When he's pushing it on him in the head.  That face right there.  Jesus.  80 takes, your Scatman crows, you're like, I don't have much time left, Scatman.  He couldn't get the contrast of his nostril right, I think.  Jesus Christ, it looked like a tunnel.  How great.  Did you ever watch this documentary on the DVD?  Yeah, yeah.  No, there is one.  You would love it.  It opens with him brushing his teeth. 
[03:41:30]  Fantastic.  He's brushing his teeth and he's talking about like, you do this out of respect for the other  actors.  And he's being Jack Nicholson while he does it.  And then he kind of leads us onto the set.  You see Stanley Kubrick yell at Shelley Duvall.  Shelley Duvall is brilliant.  Shelley Duvall looks like she's going to cry.  He's like, literally, he's like, God damn it, Shelley, you just keep fucking it up or something  like that.  He's very harsh with her.  She was the one that gave him the most good.  Oh, there you go.  Look at that.  Pussy.  Here it is, man.  She's got them long legs.  It's like a catcher's mitt down there.  Yeah.  I love his, he doesn't even care that there's a ghost pussy. 
[03:42:00]  He wants to fuck anything with that AIDS patient upstairs.  She is very long and thin, right?  Yeah.  And she goes right for the kiss?  Yeah, she goes right up to her.  When I look at her now, that looks like my wife naked.  Maybe that's why I married my wife.  You look like the chick in the pool in the fucking tub of the shining.  Make sure you specify which one, though.  Look at how still she is.  That's what's great about her. 
[03:42:30]  Her C-scar over her pussy.  That's great.  Look at that.  The colors are great in the room, too.  Oh, yeah.  She does have a C-scar.  Yeah.  Yeah, she does.  But nice, heavy, droopy tits.  Yeah, those are just natural little fucking stagger.  She made the first move.  Yeah, she did.  She made the first move.  She's touching his coat.  She has to just touch his fucking dirty coat.  And this fucking music through this whole movie was just the creepiest heartbeat thing  going on behind it.  Composed by a man who became a woman, Wendy Carlos.  Really?  Same word at the Clockwork Orange. 
[03:43:00]  Mm-hmm.  And dead now.  Dead?  Wendy Carlos died?  Yeah, dead.  I believe so, yeah.  Grady was in Clockwork.  Yes, he was.  He played the father.  Yeah.  Now she's reaching her hands around Nicholson, and he's doing exactly what anyone would do  when you see a fucking ghost.  The small of her back.  Yeah.  I love the kiss.  Right for the fucking smooch.  Dude, that sounds very much like Full Metal Jacket, too.  Yeah, very much.  Same music?  I guess she probably, I think she probably composed that.  He's smooching around.  I don't know what gives it away that he's kissing a dead thing. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, well, maybe he opens his eyes.  Now is she?  She's probably still the girl there.  No, she's the old lady.  That looks like old Ben.  No, that's a switch.  They just hid the, they hid the, they did a whip pan and hid the cut in it.  And she's all rotted.  Yeah.  And the kid is shaking, of course.  This kid does not handle crisis well.  We get it.  Holy shit, what a scene.  Oh, that's so creepy.  Yeah, she's laughing, and I like the, you're getting out of the tub.  The thing is, as a 10-year-old, I found this bullshit, because I'm like, even if she's  laughing at me, I'd still want to have sex with her. 
[03:44:00]  We would make it out and stuff.  And that's such a nice room.  What a suite Delbert Grady had.  I know.  It's like a three-room suite.  What are you going to screw it all up by hacking your kids apart?  I'd move the family in there.  Fuck the ghosts.  That whole getting out of the tub thing with that old lady is the creepiest fucking thing.  I know.  Once he gets outside in the room, man, that's where I'd be really scared, because then  you've got to get from there throughout the rest of the hotel.  Yeah.  Why'd he leave the key in the door?  I would have taken the key.  He's a little shaken.  Man, I'd be down at fucking, down at the bar in a second. 
[03:44:30]  I like the fact that Scatman flies Continental to fucking Denver to see Larry Durker.  Larry Durker's got to get him the snowcat.  Apollo Creed's trainer.  The snowcat.  Yeah.  I just like how he doesn't have the time to explain, like, the shine.  He's like, ah, the people that are taking care of the hotel are just a bunch of assholes.  A bunch of assholes.  Unreliable assholes.  Yeah, he doesn't want to say the boy is summoning me because the hotel is murdering my family.  The guy's trying to, ah, fuck it, they're just a bunch of assholes.  Assholes, I need a snowcat.  Well, technically he's right, too, because Nicholson didn't do any upkeep. 
[03:45:00]  He fucked up.  He took the thing out of the snowcat.  The distributor, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  And they took the transistors out of the radio, too.  Took the transistors.  He ruined the bathroom door.  He was the opposite of a caretaker, man.  Fucked it.  Fucked everything up.  I love Shelley Duvall.  Her skinny ass couldn't get out of the fucking, ah, out of the window.  Right.  80K-12, 80K-1.  And in the book it was a hedge.  And the cop is just like, anything else?  Oh, she was babbling.  No, the worst part of that is, um, everything's fine here. 
[03:45:30]  How's it with you?  Over.  Over.  And the whole scene is over.  And you know the dude on the other end was like, shut the fuck up.  And the cop took his dick out because he was hoping it was Tub Lady again.  But then he realized it was just her.  Those long shots are the best, though.  Like, when he's on the fucking, ah, on the big wheel, the quiet and then the fucking noise.  I was saying, that was Steadicam.  They're following the Steadicam all around and whatnot.  And that's, I think he was one of the first.  That was like one of the first.  But he was one of the most notable.  Steadicam is a guy on a fucking, ah. 
[03:46:00]  No, that's the camera that you wear like, ah, the, ah, remember Aliens?  It's a counterweighted.  James Cameron, like, took the idea of the Steadicam and turned it into this, the gun unit they wore.  Essentially, the Steadicam harness is put on by the guy operating the camera.  And it's like a jumpsuit.  There it is.  And it goes around you.  And it has this arm that has a gyro on it that keeps it level.  It never bumps.  So you get all that creepy smoothness.  So, like, when they're following him on the big wheel, they were probably using low, Steadicam and low mode. 
[03:46:30]  It's amazing.  Yeah, it's really, really smooth.  Was he using that?  Every time you're in a movie and you see, like, 360, they go around people.  That's what they're using.  They show people, like, running upstairs with those.  And that camera just stays exactly where it is.  And then you see the actual film of that.  And it's the smoothest going upstairs thing.  Did he use that in Clockwork, too?  Because he always has those fucking long Kubrick.  You could always tell a Kubrick movie because the long, holy shots.  Just the greatest.  Yeah, the colors, the impeccable focus. 
[03:47:00]  I mean, the dude literally composed.  That always amazed me.  I brought it up before.  Like, some directors, you can watch and just go, I know who directed that just from the look.  Yeah.  It's like, how the fuck do you pull that off?  Tim Burton's another one of those guys.  Yeah, Spielberg.  Tim Burton's definitely a guy.  Spielberg was a guy that kind of had that going for him, too.  Yeah, Tim Burton.  Spielberg has moments.  If you look at the movie, you'll see a Spielberg moment.  A moment, right.  And then you're like, oh, this is Steven Spielberg.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The push.  Anytime you see me in a movie, you know who directed it?  That's my signature. 
[03:47:30]  Exactly.  I have to put one fucking Special Olympics contestant in it.  Oh, Jimmy.  So what is this that you have on, Danny?  He's just showing us how the Steadicam works.  The Steadicam and how it works and what it looks like when they're filming compared to...  You ever use one of these on anything?  Yeah, I've never personally worn them.  They don't make a harness big enough for me to wear it.  But we've used them in almost every flick since Small Rats.  Really?  Yeah.  That's got to be fun to use.  It looks like it's fun.  It is a cool thing. 
[03:48:00]  But the people that wear...  It's heavy.  The camera is heavy once you've got it on there.  Unless you're shooting with a digital camera.  When you're shooting film cameras, those things are fucking heavy.  So the dude will put it on there and it stabilizes.  But after a certain point, he's like, all right, I'm putting it down, putting it down.  There's a big rush to get it off him because he's just reached the line where he's like...  Straight out of fucking collapse.  Yes, totally.  But now with a lighter camera, like an HD camera, you wouldn't have that problem.  You could sit there and probably wear it most of the day if you want.  How does it not shake when you run?  It's got gyros built into it.  It's got some kind of...  I think they're just called gyros, right?  Those things that keep you balanced no matter where you are. 
[03:48:30]  The thing that prevents gimbal lock in the...  Gimbal lock.  I love saying gimbal lock.  There it is, yeah.  They use it in the snow.  See, all that running stuff.  How do they prevent their footprints from showing up in the snow?  That's why they don't look down at the snow.  They kind of keep it up here and don't look back too much.  And Danny fills the frame so you're not seeing the trail behind him too much.  Otherwise, you'd see two sets of footprints and you'd be like,  why isn't the cameraman helping the kids?  Yeah, like, help up!  Help that boy!  His father's trying to kill him!  Hit the man with the axe with that heavy camera, you selfish asshole.  So I'm trying to get the shot. 
[03:49:00]  That was a very scary thing, though, when he's fucking backing up  and you're worried Nicholson's going to come around the corner  and fucking catch him backing up on his own footprints.  I just remember being a kid and being like, that's clever.  Like, I never would have thought of that.  I would have been killed.  It made me feel, like, stupid as a kid.  Stupid, totally.  Because I'm like, oh, God.  I would have just, like, dropped and cried, like, don't kill me!  Then again, you wouldn't have drooled and summoned a Negro from Florida either.  You wouldn't have written murder backwards.  Those are all the tips, man. 
[03:49:30]  Parents can't read those signs anymore.  When your kid's writing murder backwards, it's time to pay attention.  You wouldn't have worn an Apollo sweater that was torn.  I might have.  That I might have done.  The kid walked into the fucking, I guess the tub lady or somebody,  ripped his little sweater.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was supposed to be the tub lady who abuses him.  And he tells his mom, and that's what she thinks.  It's Jack Nicholson.  Maybe he hurt himself.  Jack with the worst suggestion ever.  Maybe he did it to himself.  His wife's like, you idiot.  You shitty book.  I'm going to go see Lloyd and have another drink.  Shut up.  Oh, Lloyd the ghostly bartender. 
[03:50:00]  He's great.  He was a pants to glory.  I'd love to sit and get a drink from Lloyd.  Hair of the dog that bit you, Lloyd.  Hair of the dog that bit you.  Lloyd knew just what to say.  He was the guy you talked to.  Your money's no good here.  That's what you want to hear when you're going to pay for a beverage.  Of course you do.  So, Auburn Penn.  Best bartender from here to Timbuktu.  No, Timbuktu to Portland, Oregon.  Portland, Oregon.  Portland, Maine.  Portland, Maine.  Corrects himself.  Then it scribes how he fucking broke his kid's collarbone. 
[03:50:30]  By accident.  He does.  He somehow finds a way to blame him, too.  Five miserable months on the wagon.  But the way he holds that drink, and the way he fucking sucks that down,  it's like, goddammit, that's what it looks like to take a drink  when you're, like, dying for a drink.  Yeah.  That was terrific.  I know.  I've seen it a lot in Danny's face.  He's seen it a lot in mine.  That's what it looks like to really want to drink every day.  My god, man. 
[03:51:00]  Look at the time already.  Yeah, we've got to get you some heat, Ant.  What time is it?  No, I don't want to get stuck in that UN fuck dick traffic.  What do you mean?  Why can't they move the United Nations to, like, Iowa?  What's going on?  Where people just masturbate.  You've got all the world leaders coming in and messing up the city for a week or so.  Yeah.  A bunch of street closures and shit until September 30th.  When you have, like, fucking Obama and Ahmadinejad and everything,  it gets a little security sensitive.  Is this president in town tonight?  He's coming in Wednesday.  It's just so inconvenient for everybody.  They closed down, like, everything around the Waldorf Astoria. 
[03:51:30]  I saw some streets were closed down as I was coming in.  Yeah, I don't know if I could get out going eastbound the streets I usually take.  I might have to go further down.  I don't know.  I don't fucking know.  You'll figure it out.  You can get around town, right?  Cab-wise and shit.  You're still kind of fucked up.  They're frozen zones.  Yeah, frozen zones.  That's something that you never want to hear.  Yeah.  And you'll just see, like, five SUVs with lights on them blinking,  just in every part of the road shut down with motorcycle cops following them 
[03:52:00]  and not know who's what, where.  Just when they take a lane away and they do the cones in the middle.  57th Street.  Oh, fuck.  Certain guys get that, but, like, Obama is a whole area shut down.  Yeah, yeah.  They shut the city down for Obama, basically, when he moves around.  I hate that one.  57th.  We watched last time, Jimmy.  Two lanes.  They change it to one fucking lane either way,  and the middle they cone off for diplomats just to drive back and forth.  That's smart, though.  Whoever thought that is smart?  In what way?  I never would have thought of it.  I just would have wondered how diplomats are going to deal with traffic. 
[03:52:30]  I know, but it was a smart way to get them around, though.  You're not a diplomat.  It sucks.  I'm a diplomat.  I'm a true gentleman.  Yes, you are.  And I have to plug Marco Allen.  Yeah, hit it, Jim.  This Thursday, Friday, Saturday, I'll be in Florida.  Marco Allen's at Comedy Club, Off the Hook.  So come see me if you're down there.  Off the Hook.  Is it?  Yeah.  And the big news, Kevin Smith's Modcast starts back up on the virus.  Very cool.  Starting this weekend.  We're going to have promos explaining the whole thing on the channel.  Hey, can I plug something else, too, that starts this week?  Please.  Over at smodcast.com. 
[03:53:00]  That's our little podcast network over there.  Tuesday, we start a hockey show.  Really?  Yeah, my friend Walter Flanagan is doing a show with a couple of our friends called Puck Nuts.  Nice.  And it's mostly Devils-oriented, but all of the NHL.  So that's our first kind of like non-comedy, but there's a lot of laughs in it, but more  sports-oriented.  I'll check that out.  We're trying to diversify the network.  You are all over the place.  We've got seven different shows.  Now there's eight different shows a week.  Eight different shows.  One day we have two shows.  It alternates.  So they're all different. 
[03:53:30]  He's taking over this channel.  We're fucking finished.  Not at all.  You feel it?  I'm done.  All right.  Well, Kevin, it's always a pleasure.  You know that.  Yes.  Awesome being here.  Thanks for having me in.  And only for you guys do I fly early.  I was supposed to be on an 11.55 flight last night.  That would have got me in at like 8 or 9 or something like that.  No, we appreciate it.  I jumped on the 9.30, so I'd come out and sit down.  Do you still think it's tonight or no?  It's not.  No, I'm pretty sure it's sold out.  Tonight I'm in town. 
[03:54:00]  I don't know if I mentioned it.  Yeah, we didn't mention it at all.  I'm in town to do this Breakfast Club 25th Anniversary screening at the Paris.  Lincoln Center's hosting, I think all yesterday and today, they've hosted a John Hughes retrospective.  Nice.  And tonight, they're doing a 25th anniversary screening of the Breakfast Club with four  of the five cast in attendance.  So Molly Ringwald, Ali Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall, and Judd Nelson.  For some reason, Emilio couldn't be bothered.  Wow, really?  Really?  Yeah, I guess he's a director now.  So he's like, I don't want to fucking talk about that.  Might be doing a movie.  He could be doing a flick. 
[03:54:30]  Absolutely.  Could be doing another.  But he also didn't do the Oscar thing either, which I thought was weird when they gave  the tribute to his on the Oscar.  Maybe he just wants no fucking part of that at all.  Maybe he didn't like John Hughes.  The way I've heard it is, he's just kind of like, that was then, this is now.  Yeah.  He's done with the whole thing, huh?  Which was a movie he was in, wasn't it?  That was then.  Thanks.  He's making a movie.  That was an essay Hinton book.  Was it?  Yes, that's right.  It was.  It was the same chick that wrote The Outsiders.  She wrote The Outsiders.  Rumblefish.  Rumblefish, right.  By the way, I didn't know that she wrote Rumblefish.  As he was saying it, I just kind of followed suit.  Good job.  I knew she wrote The Outsiders, but I didn't remember that he was going The Outsiders. 
[03:55:00]  It's called piggybacking.  I just piggybacked him completely.  As soon as you heard Rumble?  Yeah, what else could it be?  Either Rumble in the Bronx with Jackie Chan or Rumblefish.  One of two things.  I don't think the same person wrote the same thing.  You assimilate the information quickly, man.  That's the important thing.  Just get it and like, it's in my information now.  Yeah, I knew that.  Yeah, but I'm glad it wasn't.  That would have been humiliated if it was wrong.  Yeah, it would have been.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Kevin needs to sleep and eat.  I am going to go to sleep, man, for a couple hours and then go over there and do that thing tonight.  I get to moderate.  I get to kind of be John Hughes tonight. 
[03:55:30]  I get to stand there with the cast and ask him questions and whatnot.  Try not to be too geeky.  Try to keep it funny.  But then I noticed they only give us 45 minutes.  Why?  I mean, fuck.  Why even bother showing the movie?  We've all seen the movie.  Let's just do three hours of asking these motherfuckers questions.  I know.  So we'll see.  Hopefully we'll push it later than it's scheduled to go.  But, you know, you can go on for hours.  You can do an hour with each person minimum.  So, you know, hopefully we'll try to keep it interesting.  Ask Ally Sheedy if she did fuck John Candy in Only the Lonely. 
[03:56:00]  I've been dying to know that for fucking 10 years.  I know this has nothing to do with John Hughes.  But Chris Columbus wrote that and he was a huge protege.  So a backdoor question from Jim Norton, who's not in attendance.  He's got it all figured out.  Did you fuck John Candy?  He's got it all figured out for you.  You think she did?  No.  Why not?  I don't know.  Because it's just not the way it is.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But he was good.  It was a great movie.  I thought it was a good movie.  A semi-serious movie.  Loved John Candy.  His mom, right?  His mom was like...  Moreno Harrow.  Yeah, Moreno Harrow was his mother.  All right.  We're back.  Kevin, thank you so much, buddy. 
[03:56:30]  Thanks for having, guys.  Thank you.  See you soon.  And yeah, that's it.  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez. </pre>
