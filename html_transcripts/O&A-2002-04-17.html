<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a lengthy segment dedicated to "Whip-em-Out Wednesday" (WoW).  The hosts enthusiastically promote the listener-driven event, where women flash their breasts to drivers displaying WoW stickers.  Numerous callers recount their experiences, detailing various encounters, locations (including highways), and the duration and number of women involved.  Specific examples include Eva's first-time WoW experience, John's report of a large group of participating women, and Spike's encounter with a B+ sized breast.  The hosts highlight the daily “wins” and offer tips on obtaining stickers and alternative participation methods.  They also discuss a planned WoW appearance on live TV at a Queens Family Court and a suicide attempt by a WoW sticker-related suspect from a bridge. A humorous montage of a previous WoW live TV stunt is played.  The planned appearance of Dennis Leary and other guests is mentioned, along with the hosts' failure to secure promised midgets.  Opera Mary, a station employee, discusses recording commercials, and a listener recounts a particularly unpleasant job: cleaning horse genitalia. The Pavarotti toilet rumor is also discussed.

The show transitions into a discussion of unusual and unpleasant jobs.  This segment starts with a graphic description of horse breeding and the resultant mess.  Listener calls detail various awful jobs, including cleaning biohazardous waste, working a boardwalk paintball booth ("Shoot Ed"), manually assisting in horse mating, and a disturbing account of a horse gelding.  Other accounts include a man in Times Square who allows verbal abuse for a dollar and a caller's experience witnessing involuntary urination by a teenage girl on a ranch.  A caller also describes using electric shock to stimulate breeding in a stud dog.  A call comes in from a listener claiming four women in a red convertible are available for WoW, but their participation remains unclear.

Ozzy Osbourne calls in, discussing "The Osbournes," his coloring books, and his detachment from his daughter's emotional problems.  Dennis Leary and the cast of "The Job" are in studio, promoting their show and recounting anecdotes, including Leary's attempts to get autographs at a Mets game. The upcoming induction of "The Job" cast into a broadcasting hall of fame, their plans for independent production, and the show's future are discussed. The hosts plan to take a young male listener on a date with Diane Farr, a female police officer from "The Job."  Crude and sexually suggestive humor pervades this segment.

The next segment delves into explicit discussions of the hosts' and guests' sexual exploits. A significant portion focuses on a caller, Chris, trying to get a date with Diane Farr. The conversation becomes extremely graphic, involving discussions of penis size, drug use, and explicit sexual acts.  Several callers share their opinions (often negative) and personal anecdotes.  Gary, a young caller, is teased.  Lenny Clark recounts an undercover experience in a gay bar, and Kevin makes a drug-related offer. Rich Voss and Jim Norton engage in a lengthy and explicit discussion of their sexual encounters.  The hosts also discuss negative listener feedback regarding a past "55-gallon drum challenge" involving women and sexual acts. The segment promotes *The Job* and other events, includes merchandise promotion, and concludes with a discussion of a listener-submitted personal ad criticizing the show.

The final segment features listener calls detailing humorous and bizarre experiences, including a roller coaster incident at a gay-themed park and a woman performing oral sex while whistling.  The hosts discuss Jim Norton's upcoming shows and promote his appearances, along with Dice Clay's performances.  They mention an upcoming Maury Povich episode featuring deformed individuals and uncut videos on MTV2.  Eddie is a guest in studio.  The show continues with crude and sexually explicit humor throughout, concluding with the hosts thanking the listeners and making further crude remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, hey! Time to be fed!  Your balls are yelling.  No!  Whatever, I'll do what I want!  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show!  Yes, yes!  My God, man!  It is Whip-em-Out Wednesday in New York City and in 17 other cities as we speak.  As another season of WoW kicks off, I've seen so many WoWs now on the vehicles driving in. 
[00:00:30]  And written in the dirt on the trucks.  People really, really getting involved in this as the nicer weather comes around.  And you can't lose.  Can't lose.  You put a WoW in your vehicle, it's going to make that commute home a little easier.  Yeah, it's the greatest radio promotion ever.  Yes, ever.  Ever.  Because we have thousands of winners every week.  Yep.  Thousands of winners every day.  Because it's really, whip them out whenever. 
[00:01:00]  You see the WoW ladies on a car and you feel like showing them, you show them.  What other radio promotion gives you thousands of winners every day?  Thousands!  Thousands!  Much better than a stupid CD.  Because the radio station plays one song off the CD.  Who cares?  Much better than having to wait until maybe the station van sees your sticker and pulls you over and gives you a choice of a CD or enters you in a contest that you might be able to win something later. 
[00:01:30]  And they give you like $104 because they pulled you over on the highway.  And then you realize, I've got to pay taxes on the $104.  It's not even worth putting out all the paperwork just to win $100.  Thousands of winners every day.  And you don't have to do anything but just put a WoW in your car.  That's all it takes.  And support the Opie and Anthony show and see what happens.  It's kind of like fishing.  You put it on and you go, you know what, what the hell, I'm going to put the WoW in my car.  You don't know.  It might not happen today.  That fishing thing is very accurate, Opie.  You're out with your friends.  You're fishing. 
[00:02:00]  What are you thinking about?  You're having a good time with your friends.  You're drinking, right?  Maybe you're on the boat.  You're eating something.  You're trading stories with each other.  All of a sudden, I think I got a bite.  I think I got a bite.  Then before you know it, you're reeling in the big one.  It's the same thing with WoW.  You slap it on the vehicle.  As you're driving home, you're not thinking about it.  Nah.  You're thinking about the commute.  It's just every day.  Here's what you do.  And then all of a sudden, what, why is, what, what, why is the girl next to me showing her boobs?  Oh, that's right. 
[00:02:30]  I had the WoW on the vehicle.  You'll end up loving us.  Yes.  Because it'll come, it'll come a time, you're miserable in traffic, and you put the WoW on,  and all of a sudden, it's going to happen.  Yes.  It's going to happen, and you're going to love a sport.  I just don't get the fishing analogy, the fishing thing.  I don't see how WoW connects to a young lad crying while his grandfather says,  if you tell anyone, I'll drown the puppy.  Right off the bat.  Drink the rest of your coffee, man.  Roy!  All right. 
[00:03:00]  So, in New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, 866-277-4WOW.  A lot of the cities just having WoW sticker stops like crazy.  Right.  I know Stephanie, who won the Naughty Nighty contest, she's handing out WoW stickers all the time down there in D.C. for us.  I hear they're doing it in Boston for us.  We're sending out our WoW van today.  I think we're going to Long Island here in the New York area to hand out WoW stickers.  Yeah.  It's really important to get your WoW sticker immediately so you can join in the fun, Anthony. 
[00:03:30]  Join in the festivities.  Why?  I kind of miss the homemade WoW signs.  When we started WoW about seven years ago in Boston,  we didn't have stickers because the station didn't support the WoW thing.  No, of course not.  As a matter of fact, they took it away from us, and we didn't have any power.  No.  You know, and it went away, unfortunately.  But what was cool about up there was that the homemade WoW signs, wherever you went,  people took it upon themselves to make their own WoW. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  So they could join in the fun.  Correct.  So we love seeing the homemade WoW signs.  And if your station that you're listening to us on doesn't have WoW stickers,  you can send a self-addressed stamped envelope to us here in New York.  We'll give you the New York version.  And if it's too confusing, you can just, you know, scratch out the radio station here in New York.  Right.  Maybe it won't make sense in Columbus or Portland or something.  But you'll figure it out.  Self-addressed stamped envelope, 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106. 
[00:04:30]  That address is up on opieandanthony.com.  Right.  And the cool thing about WoW, before we move on here, because we love Wednesdays.  It's ridiculous, especially when the weather is how it is today.  Anyway, you're going to see this WoW thing grow from week to week.  Yeah, like bacteria.  It's great.  We're going to get bigger and bigger.  We're so early in the season, but we enjoy when the construction sites put up the huge WoW banners.  We'll put the huge WoW on the side of the cranes.  Yeah.  You get the guys with their hard hats with the WoW stickers. 
[00:05:00]  You get some of our psycho fans getting on live TV with the WoW signs.  And we award all these people that help us out, help us spread WoW.  What about the people working on the road crews, on the cement barriers?  How many times have you seen a big fluorescent WoW painted?  On the outhouses?  Yeah, wherever.  You guys rock.  We see it all.  It ends up everywhere.  Everywhere.  So, I mean, all you need to participate is a WoW on your vehicle or a WoW on your book bag. 
[00:05:30]  Because people ask about that.  Could I put a WoW on my book bag?  Right.  Or put a WoW on your t-shirt, a WoW on your bike, a WoW on your skateboard.  Anywhere.  Anywhere.  And you'll see thousands of winners every single day.  On a daily basis.  Not weak, Anthony.  Eva from Cleveland, what's going on?  Not much.  How are you?  Pretty good, man.  What's going down in Cleveland today?  I just wowed for the first time.  And it says you're 18. 
[00:06:00]  Yes.  Ah, teen.  Truly turned 18.  Teen WoW.  Now, Eva, did you WoW someone with the WoW on their vehicle?  Of course.  Bravo.  See?  There you go.  See?  Only the WoW stickers.  Only people with the WoW.  Yes, we have instructed the ladies to only show their boobs to the guys that have the WoW.  And how was it, Eva?  It was awesome.  And was the guy very appreciative or what?  What's that?  Was the guy very happy?  Oh, yeah.  You probably made his week. 
[00:06:30]  And how big are you?  I'm a full C.  Full C.  Well, Eva, thanks for helping us out with Whip Him Out Wednesday.  No problem.  All right.  You guys talk.  All right.  Not much excitement in that call there, Anthony.  Well, as long as she's doing it.  John, what's going on?  Hey, I love you guys.  Why?  Love you guys.  There is three car loads of chicks on New York State Thruway between 57 and 59.  Just whipping them out to everybody with WoW signs and stickers.  In Buffalo, right?  In Buffalo, yeah. 
[00:07:00]  There must have been.  I was at the toll booth, and I was lucky enough to pull up right next to them, and they were  just going ballistic.  Cars, beeping horns, nobody moving.  It is a beautiful thing.  I love you guys.  You rock.  You know what's wild about this WoW thing and ladies listening up?  The ladies start getting together with each other.  Like, hey.  Oh, yeah.  They group up.  It's like a holiday every Wednesday.  It's like, hey, ladies, we've got to do our thing.  And they have, like, a designated driver while, you know, three or four other ladies are showing  their cans all over the house.  Just hang out the windows or sunroof.  Sure.  All right, John.  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Thanks, guys.  All right, please.  John and everyone in Buffalo enjoying that heat wave.  I hear it hit 40 in Buffalo.  Ooh, balmy.  Balmy in Buffalo.  Spike, what's going on?  Yeah, guys.  How are you doing, buddy?  All right.  I just got my first wild.  I said it did rocks like a charm with some dark meat.  They pulled up right alongside of us.  It was a guy in the passenger side, and he pulled out a wallace, and she did it, and it  was unbelievable.  And it made your day, right?  It made my day, man.  After setting my ass off that day, it was worth it. 
[00:08:00]  How big was the dark meat?  I'll tell you about a B-plus, but a little bit better than a C.  Nice.  It was pretty good.  All right, cool.  Yeah, it was worth it, man.  All right.  Thank you, Spike.  All right, buddy.  Take care.  All right.  Peace.  Bye-bye.  We've got to get through some of these calls, and then we'll move on with the show, but  people are losing their minds today, anchors of the weather.  It made your day, right?  Turn that down.  Turn that radio down.  Oh, you dick. 
[00:08:30]  Dougie F.  Yeah?  How long have you been listening to our radio show?  Megan?  How long have you been listening to our radio show?  Oh, for a long while.  I know.  Don't you know, don't you know by now you've got to turn down the radio if you're trying  to get on the air?  I didn't know I was on the air yet.  Am I on the air?  Oh, yeah.  You didn't know because your radio was up too loud.  All right.  We're on like a five-minute delay, so they can dump out of everything they don't want on  the radio.  Right.  All right, listen, I'm at the Long Island City right now. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm in a big white van with 102.7 on it.  Yeah.  And I'm with my girlfriend.  She's just wowing anything that has wow on it.  All right.  Thanks, Dougie F.  We just made a...  All right, turn your radio back up.  Yeah.  Loud.  So you don't hear the truck horn blaring down on you.  Turn the radio back up so you can hear how ridiculous it just sounded on our program.  You sound ridiculous.  Ridiculous, and a man with a girlfriend wowing can't afford to look ridiculous.  Ridiculous, ridiculous.  Brian. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  What's up, Brian?  What's going on?  I'm on Park Avenue in 57th.  I got a wow on a concrete truck about 15 feet.  I'm pulling up to the Brooklyn Diner.  You're going to be outside the Brooklyn Diner with your wow display?  Yeah, in about five minutes.  And what?  You're driving a huge concrete truck?  Yeah, I got a fleet of 50 concrete trucks.  Whoa.  My company's Ferrara Brothers.  An Italian guy in concrete.  Woo.  Go figure that one out.  Wow, that's odd. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, I read your email before the show today.  I'm going to be pulling up in about five, ten minutes.  You could look out the window from 50 stories up, and you'll see it spinning around.  Cool.  We'll send someone out there to get a picture so we can get it on the website.  All right.  No doubt.  Hey, Brian, thanks for helping us out with wow.  No problem.  All right.  Peace.  All right.  Look at these.  I mean, the calls are going nuts today.  Pete, you're next on the opening of the show.  Good.  What's up?  Hey, Anthony.  How are you?  I was driving down a turn fight, right?  I got my wow sticker on the back of my truck. 
[00:10:30]  And this big black chick, man, she whipped these two big black memories out at me.  And you know what else I wanted to tell you?  That no matter what you guys do, that guy in the morning on his worst day is awesome.  Nice try.  Hey.  Nice try, Pete.  Nice try.  Did he really get wowed, though?  Is that true?  Huh?  Yeah, sure.  Very important.  There you go.  Wowed by a big black girl, I guess.  There you go.  Pete, if you only knew. 
[00:11:00]  If you only knew.  Someday, everybody will know.  Right.  Double LC, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Oh, our friend from Cleveland that was in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Nice.  Here you go.  Hey, what's going on with you, boy?  I know you wow every Wednesday.  I wow every single Wednesday with my shirt on or off.  And I've got my outfit on a day that I want to wow people with.  But we did something special for you guys here in Cleveland.  What's that?  Made a little bitty wow commercial.  What do you mean?  It's just a little bitty commercial that we put together.  Well, actually, I did for everybody that was on Wednesday. 
[00:11:30]  And where's this commercial being played?  It's not being played yet.  We're going to send it to you guys.  Oh, okay.  We'll check it out.  Oh, okay.  I have, like, the CD right here in front of me, though.  All right.  Yeah, we'll send it in.  All right.  We'll do that.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye-bye.  She's one of the nicest heinies I've ever seen.  She's got a nice, she's got a nice, just about everything.  She's so sexy, it bugs me.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I got a problem with wow. 
[00:12:00]  Why?  I was wowed the other day, the last week, and I happened to miss my exit on the highway.  That will happen from time to time.  It was great, though.  All right.  She was in a red BMW with cow seat covers.  All right, cool.  Thank you, Bill.  Good work.  All right.  QFC from Queens is giving us a little heads up here.  There are cameras everywhere, CNN, all the New York local news channels at Queens Family Court,  8914 Parsons Boulevard, Jamaica, Queens. 
[00:12:30]  They're there for that 12-year-old drug mule to appear in court for the first time.  He was just released from the hospital.  So they're down there, Queens Family Court on Parsons Boulevard in Jamaica, Queens.  And all the stations are going to be doing live shots down there.  You will be cordially invited down to this very radio station if you happen to get a wow on there today.  We'll whisk you right through security.  You will be whisked in.  We will give you some sort of prize, I'm sure. 
[00:13:00]  That is completely fine.  We will handle you like you're a terrorist trying to get through Logan Airport.  Yes.  You will get right in.  Is that the 12-year-old kid whose father made him take drugs in a balloon or something?  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  I hope he's a member of a parental group.  That's what a good parent does.  Hey, he doubled the balloons, though.  He cared.  Well, it's an open answer.  Yeah, it's time to get to a wow on live TV.  The first person that does it in New York will give you something very special.  We'll give you a great prize.  And here's a perfect opportunity. 
[00:13:30]  Right there, Queens Family Court on Parsons Boulevard, Jamaica, Queens.  All right.  Let's go to David, who's in D.C.  What's up, David?  Oh, and hey.  Hey.  How you doing?  All right.  I just want to put up a warning for everybody.  You have a sticker stop down here with Stephanie?  Yeah, yeah.  And there's a jumper on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.  He's been effing up the beltway all afternoon.  And someone's jumping down in D.C.?  Well, yeah.  He's a murder suspect who escaped from Jersey.  Let him jump?  Let him jump, yeah.  Why the hell wouldn't you just shoot him off the bridge? 
[00:14:00]  Do you guys remember in Seattle a couple years ago there was a guy?  He was ready to jump, and he was taking up traffic so bad, and after three hours, people  started screaming, jump, just jump.  And she did, and she did.  Bravo.  Yep.  Isn't that great?  She lived, unfortunately.  Hopefully this plane will jump, too.  They ought to just shoot him off the bridge like when you swat a fly that's on something.  Flack.  Just watch him plummet into the water.  David, where's the Wow sticker stop in D.C. today?  At 5 o'clock, she's going to be at the Springfield Mall. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, wow.  At Exit 2.  I'm a New York listener, but I'm trapped down here for six months.  Go check out Stephanie.  She's beautiful.  Oh, I have to.  All right.  Thanks, David.  All right.  Yeah, D.C. really getting involved with Wow, and we greatly appreciate that.  Jesse, what's going on?  Hey, if I was only in New York today, oh, my God.  I'm out here in Portland, Oregon, and there ain't shit going on out here, man.  Portland?  Hey, Portland?  Hey, we're on in Portland?  You are on in Portland, Oregon.  9-70, hot talk.  Hot talk, yeah. 
[00:15:00]  A.M.  I love the amplitude modulation, Opie.  Hot talk.  You betcha, man.  Yeah, it's unbelievable here in New York today.  It's the girls.  Oh, my God.  The girls.  Yeah, I just called my dad, and he said it's 95 and just below D.C. today,  and I was just going nuts because it's cold and raining out here.  It's really.  It's 55 degrees.  It's really dangerous here in New York.  Like, I think there was a reason why God made seasons where you go from winter to spring  slowly.  Yeah, yeah.  But when you go from winter where the girls are wearing five layers of clothes and a week 
[00:15:30]  later, because it pretty much had some flurries in the area about a week, week and a half  ago.  Yeah, it was cold.  Where they're down to, like, just a tiny little T-shirt, no bra, no undies.  I mean, the girls are walking around New York.  It's just, the sights are ridiculous.  Naked.  Oh, what?  Great.  Yeah, we're not going to stay here for about another month, month and a half.  But it just makes it that much more special, though, to go from winter coats to this.  Right.  We had no warning.  It wasn't like, oh, okay, now we're down to a light sweater.  You know, now we're down to a light jacket. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  It went, boom, right to shorts and a T-shirt without bras in New York.  And the women in New York do not believe in bras in general.  It's unbelievable.  All right, Jesse.  All right, thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Yep.  Isn't it beautiful?  All right.  So that is going on.  I mean, we can take calls like that for the next three and a half hours.  Yeah.  Wow is happening like you wouldn't believe.  Running rampant, as they say.  That's right.  Hey, speaking of live TV, we promised this last week.  I'm still trying to search out the wow report they did on us in Boston. 
[00:16:30]  But I have Psycho Mark.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  What is this again, Ben?  Is this when he blindsided?  It's a montage of all the ones he's done?  Or is this the one where he knocked over Maury?  This was the original, the first one he ever did.  It was the CBS 2 one.  I don't even think this was Mario Alta.  I think this was the very first time he did it.  We should have a Mario Alta one.  I don't know.  That was hilarious.  A little tip for the people that want to get wow on live TV. 
[00:17:00]  There's a couple of ways to do it.  You've got to kind of be smart about it.  You can't just run up with a wow sign not knowing if they're on their live shot yet.  You've got to know that they're doing their live shot, which usually happens around 5 o'clock, during their 5 o'clock news thing.  You'll see the camera go on.  You'll see the person start talking.  Then you know to make your move.  Another great way is to have a friend.  I was going to say, you should coordinate with a friend.  You coordinate with a friend.  Or, in some cases, we've done it with this very program. 
[00:17:30]  We tell you when to go.  We watch the television.  You're on the phone with us.  We then go, okay, here's the live shot.  Go.  Right.  And you then run behind the live shot.  We laugh our balls off.  And check out the whole damn thing live on the show.  And then you come down here and you're rewarded and hang out with the show for the rest of the day.  As a matter of fact, the montage we're about to play, I think there's some of that going on where Mark wasn't really sure if he was on camera.  And we're kind of telling him, no, move to your left. 
[00:18:00]  Move to your left.  Move, move, move.  Yeah.  So, if you can get down there to the family court in Queens by about 5 o'clock when they go to the live shots, give us a call then.  And we'll help you coordinate it.  It will be great.  You'll put Geto out on the show.  Oh, I can't wait.  I can't wait to see the first one.  It's so funny.  By the end of the summer, you'll see news people doing their reports, especially on a day like this when they want to be out and about.  They'll be doing it on top of the van, the news van.  They don't do it at street level anymore.  And they have thugs that they take with them for the live shots to chase away any people that might do this. 
[00:18:30]  You just watch how this grows as the spring moves on and then we move into summer.  It'll just get out of hand.  And it's so funny, too, when we coordinate these things live on the air because it's like you're performing some kind of a mission.  It's like, okay, no, hold it, hold it.  All right, you're in position.  You got your sign.  All right, wait, wait.  They're going to the live shot.  Here it is.  All right, go.  Go.  And then we're watching and it's just hysterical.  It's interactive television.  And get creative with it.  We like when you dress up like a gorilla or a Gumby. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  And the most creative sign, you know, you could do it with the wow and stuff, but we welcome any O&A reference signs.  Really funny.  All right.  Let me go to Stephanie real fast.  Oh, wrong call.  I'm sorry.  Why is she calling over here?  Stephanie from D.C., the winner of the Naughty Nighty contest.  Yes.  Hi.  What's up, Steph?  You know what's so funny?  I couldn't remember what contest she won because she barely had a nighty on.  It was those pictures where she's pretty much naked that put her over the top. 
[00:19:30]  Stephanie, are you going to be in the wow me contest?  I'm not sure yet.  Probably.  You should be.  Yeah.  We're going to break that out within another week, hopefully.  We're getting organized.  But it's going to be just like the Naughty Nighty contest.  We're going to invite girls down to the radio stations that are going to participate.  Take the pictures.  And you take a picture, you know, topless, and then we'll have our listeners vote for the favorite pair.  For a huge, huge prize.  So what's going on, Stephanie?  I heard the guy that called in and said, it's a jumper on the Wilson Bridge. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Well, we're en route, and there's other ways of getting to the Potomac Mills.  It's not always by the Beltway.  You don't have to talk so much, Stephanie.  Yeah, just tell us when you're going to be there, and people will show up.  They'll figure it out.  Well, we're in there.  We're pulling in now.  So we'll be at Potomac Mills, being entered from 3.30 to 4.  And then it'll be pre-filled more from 5 to 5.30.  Okay.  Very cool.  Did you say 2.30?  3.30 to 4.00.  Don't make no. 
[00:20:30]  So 5 to 5.30.  I was making sure you know it's almost 3.30.  Okay, cool.  Okay.  Well, let us know how it goes, all right?  All right.  I will.  All right.  Bye.  What?  It's just sometimes, you know.  We want to play.  Bless us more.  We want to play this Psycho Mark montage, and I think it's what Anthony was just explaining,  where we had to coordinate with him live.  Live on the air, yeah.  We were doing the radio show, watching the news at the same time, and we worked it out together. 
[00:21:00]  Yep.  Check this out.  We got Channel 2 news on.  We got a megaphone or something to say.  There's Mark.  There's Mark.  Causing trouble on CBS 2.  With the hugest wow sign.  Marsha Kramer is a tight-ass shrewd.  This is like interactive TV.  Like Omar.  He's a freak.  There he is.  The huge wow sign.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened, Mark?  What happened, Mark?  Some CBS audience left the party.  You look like a stock-raving lunatic.  You're slastic.  You can't be doing that.  What the hell are you, Mark?  You're interrupting our own news broadcast.  God damn.  You know we're going to get in trouble by the company again. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, I know.  I don't know her.  Gents, whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Mark of course.  He's very mad at me.  You tell her, go to our boss.  No, I'm not.  I'm just hanging out.  You see the thing.  If you should be allowed to do your job, I should be allowed to be more.  I almost f***ed in my pants.  That was the funniest thing I've seen in a very, very long time. 
[00:22:30]  Mark, I got one question for you.  How do you walk around with that set, you guys?  What do you, like, walk around like John Wayne, swaying, like?  Yeah, I just want to know, guys, when is the farewell show going to be?  That's why you're going to listen every day.  This could be it right here today.  You never know.  Oh, man.  That got me so excited.  I forgot about that.  Second, Mark, we saw him, you know, because we're watching the television.  It's live. 
[00:23:00]  We're on the phone with Mark, and he can't see the live shot, but we can.  So we were going, move over to the left, left, because we saw like he was just out of frame,  and he moved over, and there he was.  We were directing him.  Totally interactive television.  I cannot wait to do that again.  It's so much fun.  Oh, we're going to get a bunch of new ones.  Yeah.  So there you go.  Getting more and more excited about Wow Anthony.  Let's go to Heather.  Heather, what's up?  Yeah, I have a complaint about Wow.  Yeah, go ahead.  Guys, with Wow in the car, every single one I've seen speeds by like 80 miles an hour, 
[00:23:30]  and I don't even get a chance.  Oh, well, they're lost.  Guys, look around a little bit.  You might be missing something, man.  All right, and Heather, where are you calling from?  Marriac.  Oh, nice.  Look at that.  Wow's spreading all over the place.  All right, man.  Thanks, Heather.  All right, we'll break.  Did we have any luck finding the midgets for Dennis Leary and the gang?  Oh, boy.  Goddamn midgets.  Goddamn midgets.  Oh, boy. 
[00:24:00]  Goddamn midgets.  Not only are you genetically horrendous, you're unreliable.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Marriac Povich can get them anytime he wants.  We promised Dennis Leary and Lenny Clark and Adam Farrar midgets the next time they come on our show.  They're going to be here in 45 minutes.  We don't have the midgets.  We don't have any midgets.  No midgets.  We want a girl, little person would be ideal.  What happened to the midget stripper?  She hates us.  Phone's disconnected. 
[00:24:30]  The message I left on the one thing was somebody else's phone number.  Not for nothing.  I think she was retarded.  Are you sure it's disconnected?  Maybe she couldn't just reach the hangover.  We're getting a busy signal for four weeks.  Never know.  Those Vienna sausage fingers gripping the phone.  Yeah, hitting five or six.  You know, trying to dial a two.  It's a one, two, three.  No, little fat, awful, uncoordinated fingers.  Yeah, midget goes to shake your hand.  It feels like you're squeezing a muffin.  It's all puffy and palm in their hand. 
[00:25:00]  You've got a little shaking hands and a little muffin.  A little baby foot.  To bronze your fingers.  Give you a good raping.  A baby foot.  All puffy.  That's what midget hands feel like.  Little nubs for fingers.  They're just awful.  So come down here.  Yeah, come on down and be loved.  All right.  Watch your nose with your fat fist finger.  Dennis Leary and the gang coming by in about 45 minutes.  Awful little creep.  Yeah, we're going to look really stupid. 
[00:25:30]  You're unbelievable.  Jeez, man.  And then we got, I mean, there's a whole bunch of things we've got to get to today.  Yeah.  All right.  Right-o.

Sweet release?  Sweet release  Oh, release  I'm a girl and even I felt like a dummy  I heard you were very uncomfortable trying to do the latest version of the sweet release commercial  I was  I was not enthusiastic enough, apparently  Yeah, well, because we made such a stink about having to do this read 
[00:29:30]  It's a, I guess a pill, is it, that you take  And before you know it, your byproduct of sex tastes like some type of fruit  So while we're doing it, we were a little uncomfortable with saying how the male product tasted  Because, quite frankly, we don't know  Exactly  I don't know if it tastes like a hard, crisp apple  I don't want to know  And more importantly, they took us just goofing around doing this live read 
[00:30:00]  And made it into a real commercial  They took out all the parts where we're goofing around and talking weird and screaming  And threw it together  So, they took our advice and had a girl do the read  Right  But, Mary, how many reads have you done?  I haven't done very many boxes of the reads yet  So, she had to throw it together  And we have some audio of it  Steve's gathering it up  I think how uncomfortable she sounds 
[00:30:30]  Her and Stinky should have done it together  And at the end, she should have went  That tastes awesome  Awesome  Hi  How do I taste  I hear I taste like a hard, crisp apple  These guys are awful  And the new Club Stinky brand  You'll taste like Thai stick  Hey, Mary, did you  You sang the latest version of the Awesome Garrett tune, right?  Yes, I have  Yeah, this one's for our old boss, Dave Dickless there at AF  Dave Dickless

[00:31:30]  I went to college for that  For almost three years  Where do you go to opera college?  You go to a school that just has a music program  Yeah, like Fordham had a good school  I don't remember seeing that when I was looking at the SUNY book  Like, hmm, I want to go into opera  Opera school  Hey, look at that  Potsdam has an opera program  I'm going to open up a little opera shop  Right  How boring were the parties on a Friday?  Everybody get around a piano and sing?  Oh  I have to say, in that field, people are annoying like that

Hey, you guys  Yeah  Hey, ONA  I love you guys  Yeah, man  No, I mean you suck  Thank you  Thank you  And you particularly suck today  You're picking on opera singers  So you think we're different from you guys  Yes  Should we pick on opera singers?  I guess so  You're an opera singer?  I'm an opera singer  Give me a little  Yeah, fill something out  You ready?  Yeah  Wow 
[00:35:30]  Bravissimo  That was Italian  Wow, that's really good  The phones cannot handle opera  Do you notice that?  Phones just go to crap  There's too much stuff going on for the phone line  Did you go to opera college too?  I sure did  I went to Carnegie Mellon University out in Pittsburgh  Which is great for like computer science  But it also has a good music program  And what are you doing?  You ever hear like you got Juilliard  You got Manhattan School of Music  Yeah  You go to school for this  Ted, we're just jealous 
[00:36:00]  Don't worry about it  I know  What do you do with your opera?  What do I do?  Yeah  I was just in Florida for three months  Doing an apprenticeship with Sarasota Opera  That kicked ass  You spent three months in Sarasota, Florida  I don't know if you know where that is  It's like south of Tampa  It's beautiful  Yeah  It's like a big vacation  And you just sing  You just sing some opera with some people  With a lot of people  In front of crowds  Like big crowds  In front of crowds  Who's the best opera singer in the world?  Is Pavarotti the best one?  That's me  Oh, he's a little cock chore 
[00:36:30]  Pavarotti actually brings his own toilet from gig to gig  He's so fat  This is true  Thank you  Stop it  Absolutely true  Thank you  He has his own toilet  On tour with him  Because he's a monster  But how did he  Oh, you're talking about  We were talking about Pavarotti  I thought you were talking about me  No, no  Pavarotti  This is true, dude  Pavarotti has his own toilet shipped from city to city  Because I guess he's tired of trying to sit  Can you hold on one second, sir?  No  One second  He can't  You know, every time they stop the show  When they have intermissions  They eat the full course meal  Ted?  Yeah  It's not all about you  Hold on 
[00:37:00]  Hold on one second, Angel Lines  Listen for a little bit  He brings his own  Because, you know, it's got to be tough to actually take a dump like a human being  Right  So fat, awful Pavarotti has his toilet shipped  Now, I don't understand  How do they pipe it?  How do they connect it to plumbing?  Well, dude, I'm sure they can do it in a hotel  I mean, they can take it  No  Wait, wait, wait  This sounds  We'll call you out on this  I'm definitely calling you out on this  Yeah, no one gets their toilet shipped from gig to gig  Unless it's a huge, like, toilet 
[00:37:30]  It's a whole bathroom on the back of a truck  That  But they cannot just take a toilet  And start doing major plumbing renovations in a hotel room bathroom  Well, you're in a hotel  Yes  They can't just take the toilet off and put a new toilet on  Dude, where do you read this?  You probably could, but you'd have a huge problem with  No, you wouldn't  I mean, the hotel can allow you to remove their  Pavarotti, yeah  Look, your pen is red  Dude, I am  I'm telling you 
[00:38:00]  Unless it's hooked up a different way  But he brings his own special toilet seat  Norton's probably in heaven thinking that  Someday he'll be able to do this  A hotel room with my own toilet  Where I can lay underneath it  And have a gal sit there  You know how he is with his hotel room  I want my own toilet  Maybe Stinky  Pavarotti does it  Maybe Stinky was in the room right after Pavarotti was  Pavarotti  And it was just somebody they dumped the rest of the toilet  We thought it was Pavarotti's toilet  He's a 300 pound  Our Jim  Is a gullible Jim  Jim 
[00:38:30]  Dude, no  I actually read it  Where did you read this?  Where did you read this?  I heard it  Prove this  You heard it  It's a total rumor  It's not  It is  There is no way  He has a crew  Of plumbers  That follow him around  One guy  To move a toilet  And then replace it with his personal toilet  You know he also to get on the stage  He has to be lifted to walk up to a stage  He's too fat  He has to be lifted to get onto a stage  Alright Ted, hold on a second  I'm going back to you to say that  It's true  Someone's going to back you up Jim 
[00:39:00]  It's true  Julio  What's up  Hey, what's up  Down by the schoolyard  What's going on?  It's a guy  Pavarotti  That son of a bitch carries his own toilet  Thank you  Each gig  He has an intermission  He has a four quart meal  And he's got to take the dump  Someone find that story for us  It's true  It's true  Where do you find out about this?  I read it in the papers also  I read it in the Time magazine  I read it  I read it also in the Daily News  It's a true story 
[00:39:30]  Alright, thank you  Thank you, Angel Face  I know the guy's going to back you up  I still don't  I'm not buying it  I absolutely do not believe this  Listen, everyone has weird little  When you're that  He's probably the biggest opera singer in the world  You can make certain weird demands  For us, that's weird  But when you're the biggest opera singer in the world  As a comic  I worked with Dice  Dice gets amenities  Can I ask you something?  He's a comic  Let me ask you something  Alright  I know  Being in the HVAC business for a while  The heating and air conditioning business  For a while 
[00:40:00]  I worked with many of the trades  I worked with electricians  With plumbers  And other HVAC guys  I've seen many, many toilet installations  They are not that difficult  I do understand that  And for the most part  In the United States  Very standardized  The bolt patterns  Everything  The diameter of the pipe  Very standardized  Across the country  You go to  Now this guy tours the world  You go to Japan  Or Russia  Or somewhere else  The toilets 
[00:40:30]  Are going to be different  Does he have toilets  That are adaptable  To all those different  Pipes  And  Screw mounting positions  I don't know  It's possible  It is ridiculous  To assume  That he has a toilet  For every nation  Bring  Bring my  Japanese  A toilet  I need the  Japanese  A toilet  Today  How is he  Thinking about such  Maybe he doesn't  Maybe it has  It's so like  You know  Like a port-a-john  I don't know  Maybe a port-a-john  We're arguing 
[00:41:00]  Pavarotti's toilet  Yeah but what  Two men just  Getting turned on  Harry what's up  Hey he doesn't  Bring his own  Toilet  He brings like  His own seat  Like a baby seat  Oh his toilet seat  Okay my  Oh my god  That's completely  Different then  He brings a  Toilet seat  Okay  I'll agree  With that  That we can  Agree with  We are in agreement  That the whole  Toilet has to  Come out  And  No you guys  Said that  You said toilet  Not toilet seat

[00:42:00]  Hey I need to take  A dump backstage  There better be  A toilet back there  A toilet  With soft paper  For a delicate butt  That delicate Italian ass  But they may have  Requirements on the  Toilet ball size  No distinct smells  Anywhere near the artist  There can't be flowers  Wow  No smoking of course  Oh well  I guess Tom can't be  Backstage at a Pavarotti show  It doesn't say  Toilet  HVAC has to be quiet  What is that 
[00:42:30]  Towels  Eight towels  But nothing about  A toilet  He needs a golf cart  To move around in  Yeah  Alright  How many pages  Is his rider  Five  As it should be  He's got a five page  We ought to send  This exact rider  With Oli and Anthony  Wherever Pavarotti  That's right  To the next road show  We want toilets  We want the exact rider  To send to the next city  Soft tissue  We're bringing a plumbing crew  With us when we hit the road  Next  Alright  John what's going on  Yeah

[00:45:00]  Oh wow  And the reason he's famous  Is because he can eat cancer  Well who's the best  He's still a great artist  Who's the best  I don't know  I like Pavarotti  I like Placido Domingo  I like them both  Alright hey Ted  I love Jose Carreras  I don't know  Ted  Yeah  Before we put everyone to sleep  Thank you  Okay thank you  Can you send us some opera stuff  Send you some opera stuff  Yeah like I don't know  Do a little something for the show  Like it's Whip Him Out Wednesday  Oh  A little Anthony show  Yeah  Something like that  Oh  What do you mean like record something

[00:46:00]  When he performs in London next month  Britain's The Sun newspaper  Reports that the  160 kilogram star  That's like  Stop forcing the metrics on us  They suck  I believe this is a British website  I'm dealing with  Had the lavatory specially made  To take the Pavarotti body  When he's away for international gigs  So that sounds like it's a whole thing  That maybe goes in a truck  And he can step up  Go in the trailer 
[00:46:30]  Go into an enormous bathroom  That makes sense  Having a team of plumbers  With wrenches  And wax seals  And what not  To fasten the bowl down  I didn't break it down like that  I just said  It goes in his own toilet  Wire suspension  Things on the side  Like a bridge  You know what I'm just thinking about  Technical  I don't know anything about  How it goes  And you're talking about  The different pipe settings  And what in our Japan  Well you know  They crabbing a little bit  About a lot of things  If you think about it  Jim was right  I was right  Okay  I mean you know  I said he brings his own turlet 
[00:47:00]  You broke it down  You went on a technicality  My friend  Yeah I was right  Can you imagine it to Jim  Could you imagine  Your job is  To remove the Pavarotti waste  Yeah  Or to scrape the fecal matter out  So when they lift it up  It doesn't spill all out  All over the dock  Little Ketner boy  Fat pig  Why does he stop eating  Disgusting and dull  That's got to be  The worst job in the world  He's shoving food  To his fat bearded face  How come  Why do opera singers  Have to be fat 
[00:47:30]  That annoys me  That toilet was Pavarotti's toilet  And those beaches will be open  It's the 4th of July  Wipe you son of a bitch  Oh there we go  Saw Pavarotti  Eat a rocking chair once  All right  We'll come  Oh boys  He's here for his noon area  That pig selfish fool

[00:50:30]  Up an elephant A  And rub his prostate  So that he won't go  And attack the female elephant  That is not a job  That is  That is  I swear to God  Dude that is a job  Why would they have to do that?  Because  Elephants  They don't  I guess  Neuter elephants  When they're in captivity  Because they need to try to breed them  Yeah  And so  An elephant  You know  If it's that time of  You know  The year for him  To mate  So they don't attack  The female elephants  Then it hurts them 
[00:51:00]  It relieves the elephants  Of built up pressure  Yeah  You have to massage  The elephant's prostate  Do you have to do that  Or somebody else?  No  No  You know of someone  That does this?  I knew a guy  That worked at the zoo  But I didn't know  That wasn't his job  Wow  That's an awful job  We need someone to confirm  That this goes down  At the zoo  Yeah  All right Dave  Thank you  All right  Take it easy  When I had a horse  When I lived out in California  A lot of 
[00:51:30]  I don't  A lot  A lot of the people  That own horses  You've got to take care  Of your horse  Right  It's not like you're rich  And have the stable hand  To take care  You take care  Of your own horse  There are certain jobs  That are completely  Disgusting  And I was watching  I know what you're going to say  Because I had a friend in college  And I'll tell you  What he had to do  To work his way through college  Yeah well  I think it's going to be  Very similar to your story  This isn't even college kids  Get this  This is when I was in 
[00:52:00]  You know  Elementary school  And what not  You know  I was a kid  And the other kids  Around the stable  That had horses  Some of them  Were girls  And they were anywhere  From age of  Eight  Up to  Thirteen years old  And they had their own horses  They had to  If they had a male horse  They had to  Grab  The  Mule  Right  Mule  Anything in this context  Even funnier  Pull it out 
[00:52:30]  Of the sheath  Because you know  How it kind of goes up  Into the sheath  And pull off  Dead skin  That resembled  Beef jerky strips  They're grabbing it  Right  Holding it out  And pulling it up  Because that can  Irritate them  And cause infections  And that was their job  That's their job  And female horses  You know how they have  The little  Oh you know  What you call them  The breasts  On a horse  Horses have boobs  But you know 
[00:53:00]  What's weird  On a female horse  They're right  Between the back legs  Now of course  People are going to say  Of course they have boobs  But I mean  Can you see  When they get pregnant  You really can't  When they're not pregnant  You can't really see them  They're just inside  The back thighs  Right up to the back  Of what you are  Disturbed man  Jim Norton  And in between  The two of them  It will build up  To where you pull out  This thing of dirt  And sweat  And build up  That is about  It's about the size  And consistency 
[00:53:30]  Of a Drake's  What do they call that  A ring ding  Yummy cake  It's just this big  Flat ring ding  It looks like  And you got to  Clean that out  No  Yeah  And here are like  Kids just you know  Muscling in  One of my roommates  In college  His family was  Quite poor  Yeah  And he had to  Work his way  Through college  And he would  Wake up every  Not every morning  But I think on  Weekends it was  Or something like that  At four or five  In the morning  He would put on  A rain slicker  And his job 
[00:54:00]  Was to mate horses  Oh yeah  They do this too  And he would  Explain the whole  Process and how  When a horse  A male horse  Does his thing  It is just so  Out of control  You've got to  Wear a rain slicker  Because it goes  Everywhere  And he would  Have to take  His job was  To take in two  Hands  Yeah  The horses  You know what  The mule  And get it in  The right place  Yeah  A lot of times  To make the horses  And that was his job  Because horses  I guess they're  Very sloppy  And they're  You know  It's all about  Just  Well you know 
[00:54:30]  They're insane horses  Right  When they get  Worked up like this  The stallion  Goes completely insane  And can tear the crap  Out of a female horse  That you're trying to make  So you want it done  As quickly as possible  Also  If he takes a couple  Of jabs  And misses  Doesn't matter  The mere act  That he's doing it  It'll go all over the place  Yeah  So you want the money shot  To be where it's  Around the horse's face  So his job 
[00:55:00]  Is to guide it in  Yeah  Much like a U-boat  You guide the torpedo  Into the old torpedo  I had a roommate  In Geneseo  That was his job  A lot of farms  Up there  You know  Yeah  Well did the owner  Say like  I'm not going to race him  I'm just going to put him  Out to stud  I'm going to put him  Out to stud  Thanks Tommy  Chris what's going on  Hey guys  What's up

[00:58:30]  We're going to have to  My Monica joke  At the time  Oh I know  At the time  That's like three years old  Like Kennedy's seat covers  What  We're going to have to  We're going to have to  Do that again  There'll be some  Unusual jobs out there  There were some  Really sick stories  In California  With the horses  There was a guy  Just some guy  He wasn't a vet  Or anything  He'd just been around  Horses for years  Jimmy Jackson  His name was  Are you going to tell  One of your  Jimmy Jackson  One of your horse stories  One of my horse stories  Can you tell the one about  I don't know if you're going there 
[00:59:00]  Hold on  I got to write down  I think it's the punchline  Little penmanship  Oh that one  No I wasn't going to say that one  But that was a fun one too  Well you're going to have to  Get to that someday  The wacky cowboys  This guy  He used to buy horses  At an auction  And he'd use them  On his rent string  For a while  And then he'd sell them  To the dog food companies  After they would  Be ready to die  He was a horrible guy 
[00:59:30]  But you know  He's making a buck  He would buy stallions  And you'd have to  Gel them  You know  It means chopping  Their nads off  To calm them down  That's what you do  You can't have  A horse with his  His  Yambay  Yeah  Because they're crazy  Like that  It's very common practice  But you should see  How you think  It's a surgical procedure  How this is done  I saw this done  When I was a kid  I was horrified  He  You rope the horse 
[01:00:00]  You tie his  His legs together  And then  You take the  Sack  He took out  His buck knife  That was just  On his leather belt  Grabbed a handful  Of yams  And just cut  The  Cut the  The sack open  No  The yams  Fall out of the sack  He cuts the  Things  Tubes  And blood vessels  That are attaching them  Then grabs a  Mitt full of 
[01:00:30]  Pine tar  And just  Slaps it on there  Untied the horse  Smacks him in the ass  And the horse  Like  Whoa  Limps away  Like  A beauty queen  Out of Tyson's hotel room  That's awful  Yeah  Is that how they all do them?  Well this guy did  Plenty like that  And you know something  These ranch owners  And people that own horses  They're all from the same mold  You don't go to the vet  And ask them to  You know  You send me a bill  For gelding 150 horses  You know what I mean?  Yeah  Just go out there 
[01:01:00]  With your pocket knife  And some pine tar  I never saw one of his horses  Die from that  How about suicide?  Dean what's up?

[01:14:30]  And you show your CD  Or whatever  And get out  Meant a little something  When Carson  When Steven Wright was on  The first time  Remember that night  We were watching on TV  And he came out  And he had that set  And Carson called him right over  Huge thing  Yeah  And then he had him back  The next week  Remember that  Well I tell you  That was great  But one of my favorite  Carson's appearance  Was by Teddy Bergeron  When he did that  Crazy piano thing  I write a thousand songs  In a week  And he was killed  And then Carson  Had him back  The next time  But he couldn't walk  Under his own power  But I mean  You know 
[01:15:00]  These things happen  These things happen  We're hearing you  Cause some problems  At the med game today  Ah Piazza was a putz  He wouldn't talk to me  Then I couldn't get  The Atlanta Braves  To sign some balls  That I shelled out  Good money for  Now  From the regular  Perspective  Not the Lenny Clark  Perspective  What happened was  There was a bunch  Of retarded kids  Some were retarded  Some were just bent  Hey I get it  I get it  Some kids  They were messed up kids  But they were nice kids  And they sang  The national anthem 
[01:15:30]  Ah that's sweet  As they're singing  The national anthem  Mike Piazza goes over  And puts his  Catches his mask  Over his heart  And he's standing  At attention like we all were  Except for Lenny  Who's trying to get  Piazza's attention  And then get into  The Braves  Can you sign the ball  For me  While the retarded kids  Are singing  Well I figured maybe  They'd think I was  With the group  I don't know  I thought the kids  Sang pretty well  They did  How do you know  You're too busy  Trying to get autographs  Nah I didn't want  His autograph  I wanted Tom Glavin  Or Maddox  Or Schmoltz  Which are all  Say 
[01:16:00]  Why didn't you walk  Over to the  Well they wouldn't let me  It was a problem  Who held you back  These cops  What's wrong with them  Undercover cops  The nice guy Charlie  Used to be with the horse  Cops  These are the people I meet  They're not going to help me  And what did they say  Hey I used to start a job  I used to ride horses  30 years  Can you help me  Oh no I can't help you  They might yell at me  I go yell at you  You're retired  You're working there  This is a second job  But you're Lenny Clark  You just walk over there  Yeah but no one knows  It's Lenny Clark 
[01:16:30]  Because he's losing  So much time  That's probably it  That's right  Who's the skinny guy  And I didn't want  To get arrested  And have Dennis  Ban the rest of the  Cars from bailing me out  Because I wouldn't have  Missed our induction  Into a museum tonight  A museum  You don't know about that  What's that  Oh big news  Big news  We're getting  Inducted  And it was funny  Dennis said  You'll never hear  Any of us mention  With that word  Ever again  Inducted  It's the last time  First and last  Inducted into the  Museum of Radio  And Television  Broadcasting  Hall of Fame 
[01:17:00]  Yeah  For a show  That ABC  Didn't pick up  Until today  At least that's  The rumor I'm starting  Oh you starting  That rumor  Or do you hear something  No no no  It's not a rumor  We're getting picked up  You are  We're getting picked up  We're taking  There you go  We're taking matters  Into our own hands  Yeah  We're going to production  Whether they want us or not  And you know what  We're putting ourselves  On the air  We'll take over  The building in New York  We'll take over  The building in LA  We're on  We're picking our own night  That's the other thing  We may go multiple nights  We don't care  We don't need ABC  To tell us it's okay 
[01:17:30]  This is a free country  We're on  No one's ever done that angle  That's right  We might go on  During the day sometimes  Because I can't stay up  Late at night anymore  Since I lost the weight  There may be a whole night  That's just the job  That's right  From 8 to 11  All night  And maybe even  Different networks  That's right  You just jump around  One night  I might go running  On my bus  The next week we're on  We might take turns  We already did it  With Comedy Central  We're a very big hit  We're a very big hit over there  We don't need anybody  We're just going to make the show  And put it on our show  Just like  We're going to be like  A comedy Taliban 
[01:18:00]  We'll go from network to network  Just terrorizing the network  We'll be on Al Jazeera network  To whatever that network  We're going to have  We're going to have  Our own airlines  That's right  Smoking  You can smoke on our planes  Smoke blue  That's right  We're going to have  Smoking, drinking  And porno  In that airline  That's right  At every seat  They'll be porno  Every single seat  And our stewards  Are going to be strippers  That's right  That's a great  Stripper midgets  Midget baggage  Midget baggage  Handlers  Yeah  And there'll still be  Some sick mother  F that would bring 
[01:18:30]  Their kid on the flight  To cry behind you  The whole thing  Yeah of course  It's the porno flight  We'll have the midget  Put the kid up  In the luggage container  Because no screaming  Or crying during porno  That's one of the  Announcements they made  At the beginning of the flight  Don't cry during porno  So we're going  We're going  To a museum induction time  I'm very excited  Inducted  I'm just glad  They got rid of that  Wednesday 930 show  What the hell was that about  Why did they take you off  To put that  That's our other guy though 
[01:19:00]  I understand  Dennis explained the whole thing  But it wrecked the momentum  I understand though  But you know  How many hurdles  Do you got to jump over  The goddamn show  Give it a time slot  And let it go  They want us to dance  Like little chihuahua dogs  In a commercial or something  We're not doing it anymore  We're making the show  We don't need that  Screw that  What we need from you guys  Tonight is to have  Your loyal listeners  Who have helped us  In the past  But tonight  No fooling around  Frank is gay at 9 o'clock  And they got to tune in  And I'm not  Believe me  I'm not sleeping with

[01:27:30]  Is that Ozzy's  What you're talking about  The show needs  Subtitles  We said that on  But I guess Sharon  Didn't want that  Now Ozzy  I can pretty much  Understand this  Everything  Yeah  We have to watch  Three or four times  Each episode  Just to pick up  Everything  There's a couple of  Words that are  A little wrong  That hand man  When he came  When he started  Throwing  First he was going  To throw the wood  Over it  And then he throws  It and you hear  The smash of the  Glasses  He almost trips  Over a wire  Trying to make  His way back  Unbelievable  He's gone  I love it  Love the guy  When he changed 
[01:28:00]  The trash  You see the ones  Where he had to  Change the trash  Can liners  Yeah  You just look  Fifteen minutes  Fifteen minutes  In the TV remote  And you're watching  You're just captivated  Watching every minute  Of Ozzy  Changing a garbage bag  I don't know  If it's sad  Or great  Trying to figure out  The remote  Was one of my  Favourites  Which I think  Was the same episode  As Sharon saying  Oh my god  There's crosses  Everywhere  We'll never sell  This house  Oh my god  And last night  He was on  The Little Rascal  Oh when they  Showed that  You know 
[01:28:30]  When you  Go to Disney  Or something  And the old folks  Are riding around  On those little  Rascal scooters  They call  And to see Ozzy  Being helped off  Of the tour bus  And then the next  Thing you see  Is backstage  And he's riding  On one of those  Things  It's kind of sad  You know  That's a touch of reality  I don't want  But it's funny  It's very  Very funny  I don't care if it's sad  As long as it's funny  Baby  Oh my little rascal  Oh my little rascal  Papa Dom  They used to drive  Around the little rascal  Yeah  That chef

[01:37:00]  Oh my god  They are some tough  Tough bitches  I'll tell you that  We had two female cops  They were hot too  And we had a contest  Which one of us could keep from being cuffed the longest  We called it resisting arrest  So these girls come in  It was awesome  These female cops come in  Yeah  And we got into an open space over here in the studio  Said go  Go hit the stopwatch  And Rick wound up winning  Right  He resisted till he was bleeding  Yeah  They need him in the groin 
[01:37:30]  They weren't fooling around these girls  They were not kidding  Really  They got me  Oh yeah we got effed up  To the point where I was being choked out  And just went  Whoa  Done  I was thinking  Alright  I could at least  I'll just keep my arms in front of me  And I'll lay down  They won't be able to cuff me  They put me in a hold  Where I went  Put my arms right behind my back  And just went  Do it now  Please cuff me  Right  Tough  Tough women  I'd go for the cuff right away  You would?  Yeah give it up right away  Rick was bleeding  They had a knee in his neck 
[01:38:00]  One in his groin  And was pushing his arm behind him  And just yelling at him  Put your arm behind your back  It was so hot  How long did he last?  How long did you last?  A little over a minute right?  No  It was three  Oh that's right  That would never happen in real life  Because the cop needs assistance  Oh you'd beat that  Oh yeah forget about it  I'd beat you like Rodney King  But the girls I know that I grew up with  That are cops on the weekends  Will go out and they lie  They're like I'm a school teacher  Really they don't want to  Yeah  Totally lie  Don't want anybody to know  I don't want to  To know that they're cops  Well it's kind of a stigma on a girl

They're Christian rockers  How nice of them  But at least it's not like Striper  Well anything Christian rock stinks  But it's good  It doesn't sound like Christian rock  All right  Creed is like Christian rock  Really?  Creed's pretty damn close to Christian rock 
[01:56:00]  Ozzy  Or Sabbath  Really?  Yeah  Who to you is Jesus Christ  Ozzy  Right?  Sure  Who's on my shirt?  Opie  This from the improper Bostonian  BCN listeners  It's entitled  I am all  And they all start like this  I'm all for free speech  Right  But  Yeah  And I happen to love WBCN  However  Is anyone else out there ever offended by the Opie and Anthony show? 
[01:56:30]  I am  Ha ha  Under that  Who?  Ha ha ha  On February 22nd  The show was about how they had women there eating all kinds of gross things  I guess people were trying to qualify for the 55 gallon drum challenge  We had them eating blood and stuff  Yeah  They had one woman  Brains  In her underwear  Drinking out of a toilet bowl like a dog  Ha ha ha 
[01:57:00]  Ha ha  Ha ha  I had a rod looking at her you whore  Ha ha ha  It just looked so perfect  Wasn't it great?  That was fun  Yeah but we had  I remember that bit  We had chocolate pudding all around the bowl  We spread chocolate pudding around the bowl  And this lovely lady  She was beautiful  I think she was from the Philly area  Yeah  She had to lick the bowl to get into the 55 gallon drum challenge  Why?  Like a dog  Like a dog  I tried calling WBCN to talk with them about it  Yeah that always goes well you dope 
[01:57:30]  Just turn the radio off  Right  You stupid hole  God almighty  Why would you call?  I really  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  You really hate people  He says I effing hate people  Very loud  I hope your kid loses his hand in a lawnmower  These are the people that will ruin it for everyone  No they won't  Oh yes they will  No one listens to her  You're a fat whore  Oh yes they will  Nah no one cares about her  She's a pig  Slowly but surely  People like this are winning the battle 
[01:58:00]  They're not winning the battle  She's a pig  And this shows that BCN is right on the ball here  It says they gave me the number for the Opie and Anthony show  Which is a good thing  That's what they should do  Which I have tried calling numerous times  It rings and rings and rings  No machine  No person  No nothing  Good  Now what number  I wonder  What number she got  This number  Because these phones get answered all the time  Awesome Garrett 
[01:58:30]  Is awesome  If I may say  At answering the phone  Let her call  It's 212-307-7171  You want the number  212-307-7171  What?  You need to do that to sell 30 tickets  No  That's so pathetic  Don't worry  We're going to sell out  We're there  It's 30 tickets  I got 30 tickets left  I'll get my checkbook  Jesus  Enough  I ran about the homeless people  Enough  It's a sold out show 
[01:59:00]  She could direct it via email  By going to eatabullet.com  I'm sure  We never do something so gratuitously self-serving  That stupid hole she is  They put misogynistic crap on the radio  And then make it impossible to contact them  Very classy  So I'm airing my grievance here  Oedipus  Are you listening?  Hell no  He's not in there right now  He's not at the station  He's out  Having fun doing something  Probably playing golf 
[01:59:30]  Playing golf  Relaxing  Or you know  Is he snorting coke in the secret room?  Or stealing CDs  Or selling them to record stores  Or selling the CDs back to the record stores  To make his fortune  He's a busy man  God that bugs me  Yeah so that was from the improper Bostonian  First few things in life bother me  Like that type of person  It's just  It's just  They have to just make the repeat  Why not just turn  I don't get it  Turn it off  I've never  Complained about a show 
[02:00:00]  Oh that stinks  I turn it off  I don't understand  This fat  Lonely  Piece of garbage  I just  Oh man  I hate pieces  Isn't that awful?  Dude it's  Well she wants to decide for everyone else  What is appropriate on the airwaves  It just  It taps into something man  It just  You know  It's  A radio is  It's a device  Right?  It's a machine  It's an appliance  It's whatever you want to call it  It's got an off switch  Here is something similar  To people not turning off 
[02:00:30]  The radio when they're annoyed by it  You might want to turn this down a little bit  Hi  Hello  Jackhammer company  Yeah  I have a jackhammer here in my living room  And it's really loud  And it's annoying me  I'm calling to complain about the sound of the jackhammer  See  He listens  It's just going and going  It's in my house  And I hear it  And my kids are hearing it  And it's offensive  And it's loud  And it's annoying 
[02:01:00]  The watch switch  Oh  No I know I can turn it off  I choose not to  I choose to have it  Very loud  In my living room  And then call you  Because you made the jackhammer  And complain about the noise  But  Oh  The button  Let me  Oh  Oh yeah  That's much better  Okay  Thank you  Why would you 
[02:01:30]  If your blender  Was on  And it was making too much noise  You're going to call the blender company  Hey  It's making too much noise  Turn it off  I hope right now  Her husband is out  Having an affair with someone  Who is putting a wart on his mule  The size of a Down Syndrome kid's head  Right now  Cut to the room where he is doing that  And going  Hey  Wow  How did he know  Maura  What's up  Well  I was listening to you guys  Talking about this  Spunk holder  Boston  Who 
[02:02:00]  Spunk holder  Yes  I like that  The spunk holder  Who thinks she speaks for the majority  Like she's  Liberating all of us women  From Boston  And I can assure you  I'm a faithful  Listener  Of the opening  Opie and Anthony show  And I was not offended at all  By what was going on  During the 55 gallon drum challenge  In fact  I was thrilled  I thought it was hysterical  You have a brain  You know it's weird  These people think that we forced the ladies to come in  And try out for the 55 gallon drum challenge  And then we forced them in the barrels 
[02:02:30]  These girls really wanted in  Or they think that any woman who comes  She has a self esteem issue  And she feels bad about herself  So she wants to put herself on the radio  And be humiliated against her will apparently  Whoever wrote that article  She needs to quit writing articles  Because nobody gives a crap what she thinks  We love you guys  Alright thank you Maura  There you go  No problem  Bye bye  Bye  Anyone who's offended by humor is a liar 
[02:03:00]  And you're looking for attention  Because your life has amounted to nothing  Your little voice was never heard  So you somehow have to associate yourself  With things that are being done by other people  You're a dishonest pig  Jackie from the NYPD  Hey what's up  We get complaints  People have nothing better to do  We get people that like  Move in next to a hospital  Or move in next to a school  And then complain about the kids  Or complain about the fire  Yeah isn't that amazing  They move next to a school  The kids go out for a recess  And they're loud in the playground 
[02:03:30]  And the people are complaining  They're too loud  Make them shut up  You moved there  That's exactly what we say  There's nothing we can do about these kids  The school's been there for 60 years  And these people move in and complain about it  Airports another thing  When people move in near an airport  And then try to get the airport  To change their pattern  The flight pattern  It's like you moved there  Idiot  Yeah  You've got nothing better to complain about  They've got to find something  All right  Thank you Jackie  Take care  Wait wait  We heard you whisper that my friend

[02:09:00]  J.O.  In a hotel room?  Well from my experience  That's brilliant man  My favorite was  Me and him  On the bed with a girl  I told you the story  And the girl's in the middle of us  And we're both whacking our bags  Like she's in between us of course  That is so gay  No it's not  There's a girl  But there's a girl  And he goes  Oh my god  He goes hey let's flip a coin  And the loser has to F her  To me over her 
[02:09:30]  He says it  What a pig  You are despicable  What does she do?  She just  I laughed nervously  Because he had a rod  He was real  I couldn't get a rod  I kept laughing  And then she gets up  And gets off the bed for a minute  And we look over at each other  Like alright we gotta stop  One second  And this is what a selfish pig  He finishes right 
[02:10:00]  Oh god  He finishes  Then I'm on the bed with her  I'm packing like a half  He goes to the bathroom  And I guess there's a cat log  And the thing  And I hear him going  Trying not to puke  While I whack my bag  It was awful  His cough  He was automatically  Out of the section  Rocking Jewish throat 
[02:10:30]  Did he finish  Like on the bed?  I didn't look where it went  Are you close enough?  I was looking at her  And just trying to hope  He didn't say anything else  That made me laugh  I was laughing the whole time  Where did you find this creature?  She was some girl he knew  She lived out of state  She came in for like three days  And we went to the hotel  And then how do you start  What are you just  You're all laying on the bed  Dude you're watching TV  How do you start 
[02:11:00]  Just pulling your hog out?  It's called good cop bad cop  And he will actually go  Do you mind if me and him  Just say oh  And I'm like oh come on man  Cut it at me  While I'm unzipping my fly  Oh my god  And he'll start  He's like come on  Just touch it  And then she's looking at me  I'm like I don't know  What he's doing  I'm like go ahead  Just touch it  Shut him up  Holy smoke  That is sick  But he's always the one  That leads into these things  I'm never able to pull girls  That will do this  And she just stayed there 
[02:11:30]  Did anyone get to have sex with her?  No we didn't  And did she even touch anybody?  She might have  Oh really  Now the girl or boss?  The girl  Oh okay  I wouldn't want to gag him  And hear that one  I think I can get over those speed bumps  Hey Lewis what's up? 
[02:12:00]  Hey I just wanted to say  That I think I've seen  Rich Boston's show before  Oh yeah?  Yeah it's called  Love Line on MTV  Later  It's like a VH1  Version  Yeah it could be  I never saw that show  So I don't know  I can't  Well they got a comic  And a psychologist  That sit and take phone calls  And solve people's problems  So it's a little similar  It's about bosses  Saturday night  It's called  Love Line on TV  You're horrible 
[02:12:30]  You can't use that C word  What did I say?  George what's up?  Hey guys what's going on  You guys got to lighten up a little bit  I'll cheer up  Hey how is it possible  That the ugliest man in comedy  Gets a television job  And what could he possibly  Bring to the table  In advice  People not feeling bad  For themselves  Because they're not him  That call went nowhere  First of all  I am a good looking guy  So he can't say  I'm an ugly guy  He can  Yeah but that's not  I know I'm not a bad looking guy 
[02:13:00]  No  Anthony  Do we have any more?  What's up everybody?  Anthony's going to bring up  A good point here  Go ahead Anthony  Anthony you said before  Something about  How do you go about  Starting this whole J.O. Fest  Yeah  I want to know  Boss and Norton  How the hell  Did the two of you  Find out that you're comfortable  Even doing it together?  I'll tell you  I'll tell you  One of the first experiences  I had with Boss  It made me like  No we can just  No we can do it 
[02:13:30]  Cool  Boss to get out of my car  This is years ago  After a set  And I'm laughing  And I laughed  And he closed my door  And went into the parking garage  And got his car  And then  Wait hold on sir  I'm explaining here  You know  And then there was a time  Where he was dating a girl  And he's like  I'm going to try to get her  To give me a Hummer  While you watch  Meeting me  And I had strapped at home  She was hot  Really hot 
[02:14:00]  And I had just finished at home  Literally  Like my belly button  Really smelled like a fish  And I come into the city  This is where I live  In Jersey  And there they are  I walk by  I see Boss and this girl  In the car  And I get in the back seat  And I can't even get a ride  Because I had just arrived  And you know  She's humming him  And I'm like  You're looking back  And I'm like  Yeah  Wow cool  This is comfortable  Really  Who cares  Yeah  What's the big deal  It's not like we're touching each other  Not at all 
[02:14:30]  We don't even shake hands  We're disgusted by each other  You kidding me  You  You're like  The perverted odd couple  Yeah  You got the  Exactly  I'm a neat freak  And he has AIDS  Can I pity you  Well I got rid of it  I had soup  Soup  Chicken soup  Yeah  Chicken soup  Pured the AIDS  Yeah I got rid of it  For this week  Thank you Anthony  See you later guys  See you  See you  How did they know  We were coming 
[02:15:00]  Well most guys  Don't do that with each other  Never  In my life  I mean I've had other friends  Where we  I guess you know  Trained  Is that what they call it  Yeah  It wasn't a big deal  But you know  You know what the thing is  You can't just start a story  That you're laying there  Next to a girl  On either side  Jacking  You can't just drop us in  In the middle of that story  We need a little background  On how the hell  You got to that point  That's all I was saying  All the time  It's funny  We don't care 
[02:15:30]  Who cares  I'm not homophobic  I don't care  I don't think  He's going to try  To lick my mule again  I tell him  Hey look  That's for girls  He cries a little  And I say  Look  Nothing personal  Oh god  He had  He had  Chickatron's number  On his mule  Why  Why  I could go on air  And say  And this isn't gay  But Norton's packing  I mean  Every other part of his body  Is pathetic 
[02:16:00]  If you look at him  I mean  If you look at his  His  His no pigment  His physique  Looks like jello  Alright  But he's packing  See  And that's the whole thing  That's what gives him confidence  That must be  You know  I'm not saying  I haven't seen bigger  But you know  He's doing over  He's ducked bigger  So that's why  If we're  Like  If we're the girl  Like I'm not going to follow him  I got to open  Oh there you go  Alright

Blubber-breasted, thin-lipped, nothing  And they stare, Maury  I don't know why  Eddie  Yes, sir  What's up, man?  I learned that a girl can give Voss oral pleasure and whistle at the same time 
[02:42:30]  Thank you for catching that one, Ed  And I learned if you're going to go F with a good same girl as Norton  You have to go first  Oh, yes  All right  All right  Oh, by the way, I got, did you drop something?  I have to give a report because I'm really proud of myself  He is so proud and so happy  You know how Jim always goes, excuse me, you dropped something  Or, sir, could you please?  And then he turns away and doesn't even look at him  And the person turns around and looks at who was just talking to him  And they feel foolish 
[02:43:00]  Uncomfortable and stuff  You feel all foolish  Jim will go, oh, excuse, could...
