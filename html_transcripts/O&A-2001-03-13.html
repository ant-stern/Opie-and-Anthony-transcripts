<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a disastrously unsuccessful "Best Ass Contest," offering a Vegas trip and Pinnacle Horny Goatweed sponsorship as incentives.  The low participation was blamed on the previous day's show, which featured discussions of "freaks and weirdos" and a video clip (available online) of intern Brian faking a head injury.  To boost entries, the hosts even offered cunnilingus as a prize.  Caller Cassandra confirmed the show's morbid content as a deterrent.  Guest Adam Ferrara arrived, with the running gag of another injured intern, John, heavily bandaged, providing comic relief.  The show also unveiled new, ambiguously gay radio sweepers created by producer Jimmy, prompting much debate and ribbing.

Anthony's car troubles, including a repossessed Lexus and past mishaps, were discussed, leading to a call with a repo man describing a live repossession.  Listener calls reacted to both the sweepers and the underwhelming ass contest.  The segment concluded with Janie from Lindenhurst becoming the first contestant, her picture promised on WNAW.com, and a promotion of the Jerry Red Wilson benefit show Adam Ferrara would attend.

The show continued with more entries for the "Best Ass Contest," with several women's photos slated for WNAW.com. Janie, from Long Island, featured prominently, her "Gary" tattoo sparking suggestive banter.  DJ Drew Boogie visited the studio, playing remixes like "I Hate You All" and "Dice Dice Baby," prompting excited listener calls.  A significant portion focused on listener calls debating Napster and the ease of accessing copyrighted music, particularly Metallica songs.  Adam Ferrara, preparing for a fundraiser and promoting his new TV show "The Job" (with Dennis Leary), shared extensively negative opinions about Janine Garofalo.  A heated, insulting call with "Tony the Tool" from mafia mob.com ensued, filled with threats.  The "Best Ass Contest" continued to be a focus, with commentary on contestants and excitement from the hosts and a contestant's friend.  The segment closed with further contest promotion and promotion of Ferrara's TV show.

The broadcast then featured a countdown of "Max XX"'s "Top 25 Guy Movies of All Time," including *Goodfellas*, *Braveheart*, *Enter the Dragon*, *Predator*, *Die Hard*, *Full Metal Jacket*, *Scarface*, and *The Godfather*.  The hosts discussed the films, played clips, and veered into tangents with humorous anecdotes and off-color jokes.  A news story about a man catapulted by a manhole cover explosion in Midtown Manhattan sparked calls, including those from Con Edison employees explaining the causes (gas leaks, old wiring).  Callers shared improbable accident stories, including one about a 15-foot manhole-explosion launch.  The discussion touched upon construction crane dismantling and a caller attempting to mail a severed head to Michigan.  References to the Olsen twins and a running joke about Hispanic babies falling out of windows were also included.  Several callers were identified by first names or nicknames.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  What's your name, scumbag?  Call ourselves a pretty little maggot!  Hey, I like that. That was a new one.  I like when the new ones make their way into the show.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's the O&A Show, 212-757-1027.  How's everyone doing today?  Greetings.  That's a winner. 
[00:00:30]  I haven't even done anything yet.  Thank you.  Ah!  All right.  Day two of the Best Ass Contest, Anthony.  Yeah, we have our contestants.  We have so many pictures for you guys to check out from day one.  I think it's going to be easier to pick finalists with this.  Judging by yesterday's turnout.  What the F happened?  Well, I'm still confident.  I feel it was, um, we really didn't get the hit on it yesterday because a lot of stuff we were talking about yesterday. 
[00:01:00]  We had a very busy show yesterday with, uh, freaks and weirdos and employees.  Brian, the intern.  Whatever.  By the way, the video clip of Brian taking off the bandage from his forehead to reveal nothing.  Oh, is that on Foundry?  It's on foundrymusic.com.  I gotta see it.  You will see for yourself there was nothing there after he told us he had two to three stitches under the bandage.  Did Steve get a good zoom? 
[00:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's a great shot.  Did he get a good zoom in?  It's a great shot.  It's amazing.  I'm trying to get to it before the delay, uh, kicks in.  But, uh, Anthony, Best Ass Contest.  Yeah, look.  You're making us look like tools, ladies.  You know what I mean?  You know what?  If we don't get ladies down here, then we're not doing a road show.  Uh-oh.  And we're going to be doing a road show very soon.  Mm-hmm.  But if we don't get the asses down here, we're going to have to punish you and take away your road show. 
[00:02:00]  And I'll have you fired.  Fired.  Fired.  Yeah, we, uh, we didn't get the hit on it yesterday, and that's the reason, I feel, we didn't really get, uh, many contestants yesterday.  Oh, wait.  We didn't get any contestants yesterday.  None.  Today, ladies, there's a huge prize up.  How about the first lady to come down here and win something cool?  See, that's what we did last time.  Because no one was coming down for the booth thing.  No, that got people to come down. 
[00:02:30]  But I don't think we have anything cool.  Why wouldn't we have something cool to give away, Opie?  Whatever, Ben.  What do we got?  We don't have anything.  Yeah, right now, uh, I think Brian's in the lead.  Well, of course, Brian's in the lead.  For the best ass.  Biggest ass.  He gave us great radio on his last day, didn't he?  Yes, he did.  But, but we need, we need the girls to come down.  If you want to call before you come down, that's fine.  You know, it would make us feel good if a lady called and said, you know, oh, Ed, I'm on my way. 
[00:03:00]  And really seems dedicated, and she's coming down.  A lot of the girls that were in the boob contest.  You know, you could win a trip to Vegas by entering the ass contest.  There were plenty of girls that had great asses, too.  So, what are you waiting for?  Maybe the lady should call up and tell us why they're not coming down.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Maybe they have a problem with the way we're doing the contest.  That could be good.  Either way, we've got to get this going.  We've got a trip to Vegas to give away, Anthony.  Las Vegas Rock. 
[00:03:30]  Winner of the Best Ass Contest.  We'll get their own professional photo shoot and could become the next Pinnacle Horny Goatweed spokesperson.  Courtesy of Pinnacle Horny Goatweed, sponsor of the Best Ass Contest.  Do the weed and you'll succeed.  Prizes, prizes, prizes.  So, you get to be a spokesperson, possibly, and you got the trip to Vegas, definitely.  What are you waiting for?  Let's go to Christina.  Christina, what's up?  I was wondering, because you guys are having a lot of problems right now with the Best Ass Contest,  if I could join in with, I guess, what's in my pants?  Well, if it's an ass, come down here. 
[00:04:00]  Nah, no ass.  You don't want to have the ass work it?  Nah.  That's too bad.  We'll play What's in My Pants later on today.  All right.  All right?  Goddamn, that video clip is hysterical.  I just watched it.  Brian and his head wound.  There's nothing on there.  He comes in yesterday with a big bandit on his head and his eye patch.  And then when he takes it off, he's like, look, see, it's right there.  Right there.  Like, he was nothing.  He was trying to play it and there was nothing.  Pristine skin.  And then we all were very, very embarrassed and it was very awkward and it just sucked. 
[00:04:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And also, the girls better show up because if we cancel the road show, this is going to be a good one.  If we don't get 20 contestants for the Best Ass Contest, we are canceling the road show.  Oh, there we go.  Very funny.  Look at you.  John. 
[00:05:00]  John, our intern.  Our intern for today.  His whole head is bandaged up.  His whole face with a band.  I had a horrible, horrible accident.  I went through the windshield.  They broke my car yesterday.  Yeah.  Went through the windshield.  I'm sorry, guys.  He looks like a mummy.  It all wraps up.  I hope I'm not making you feel uncomfortable or anything.  Is your arm wrapped up, too?  Yeah.  What happened to your arm?  You broke it?  Yeah, because after I went through the windshield, I kind of fell off a building and I kind of  tried to break my claw with my arm.  With your arm?  How come you're moving it and it's just in a loosely wrapped ace bandage instead of a cast? 
[00:05:30]  And don't question it.  I believe John.  John says he was in this bad accident and fell off a building.  You know what?  I believe him.  Do you have a police report?  Yes.  I know.  In fact, I do.  All right, quick.  Where did this happen?  In my hometown, actually.  What is your hometown?  My hometown is Linden, New Jersey, actually.  I can contact the police department if you'd like.  Very good.  Try and make it through the show, guys.  I'm doing it for you.  Try and make it through.  That's good. 
[00:06:00]  Can you stay like that for the whole show?  Oh, my God.  Adam just came in.  Adam Ferrari.  He's missing an arm.  He's missing an arm.  Look, his arm is gone.  In a crocodile accident in Linden, New Jersey.  One-armed Adams in the studio.  Crikey.  This is funny.  Oh, my God.  John, stay like that for the whole show, all right?  Oh, yeah.  I have to.  I have horrible lacerating injuries on my face.  He's not lying.  You're implying I'm making this up inside?  No, we wouldn't dare. 
[00:06:30]  Somebody spoke to a lawyer.  Dan from Hoboken checking in.  Way to get airtime, John.  Well, you know what?  You know what?  He did a good job, though.  He had a horrible Israel.  I'm not trying to get airtime.  Hey, Anthony, Cassandra wants to tell everyone why no one's showing for the ask.  All right.  Cassandra.  Hi.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Actually, that's funny because I lived in Linden for a little while, so I know that area.  But the reason why girls aren't showing up is because, first of all, yesterday, you're  talking about firing this stupid intern. 
[00:07:00]  The day before, all that you're talking about is all these deaths with the firemen finding  all these corpses and stuff.  What woman is going to want to listen to this and then realize that the ask contest is still  going on?  Cassandra, we have women that listen to our show.  But during all that?  Well, maybe they tuned out that day, but they're listening today.  Yeah, but then yesterday, well, you said that you started it yesterday or you started  it today?  We started it yesterday.  Officially.  Right.  But we really didn't push it.  All right.  Because I live...  Cunnilingus to the first girl that comes down.  There you go.  Cunnilingus.  There you go. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'll be there in one minute.  All right.  All right.  I've got to go.  All right.  Bye.  Come on, ladies.  Show up today.  What are you waiting for?  Back that ass up.  Adam Ferrara in the studio.  Anthony, this is going to be a little awkward, but we have some new sweepers for our radio  show.  New sweepers.  We always like the new sweepers.  They're the clever little things that are put together by production that sort of give  you a little taste for the show.  No, it's put together by Jimmy. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And Jimmy does a great, great job.  All those incredible sweepers you hear going in and out of commercials, that's all Jim's  work.  You've heard the ones like the feature of maybe Louis Black talking about how he'll go to  court with the girls from the voyeur bus.  That whole thing.  The montage of me, Adam, and Jeffrey Ross imitating Louis, you know, and then put in with the music.  Things like that.  Well, he's got a new concept.  A new concept. 
[00:08:30]  He has ONA gay sweepers.  Look.  What?  What?  They're his ambiguously gay sweepers for the show.  I thought we went that route already.  A little concept that he...  A little concept that he's been working on.  And, you know, the guy worked really hard on these things.  Okay.  We were going to smash him and just move on with the show.  You know, Mapplethorpe worked hard, too.  Yeah.  Doesn't make the picture good. 
[00:09:00]  Adam, do you have to leave in five minutes or something?  No, I have to leave at five o'clock.  Five?  Five.  Oh, look.  Why are you so busy?  I have to go.  I'm at Town Hall tonight for the Jerry Red Wilson benefit.  I know.  Okay.  Ben, what time is that?  The car's going to come get me.  I have to go and wash him.  You have two cars now?  Jesus Christ, my pal.  Look at my pal.  Don't walk, Mr. Lexus.  We're going to start?  Look, Anthony has to give back his Lexus.  Fine.  I'm not giving it back.  I remember laying under that bug going,  the oil's going in my eye. 
[00:09:30]  I have a more clagging.  Yeah.  Look.  Look.  Why?  I was supposed to give the Lexus back today.  I'm not giving it back.  I'm telling you, I'm not giving it back.  He refuses to give the Lexus back.  I refuse.  Possession, nine pence.  It's mine.  I have it.  I'm used to this.  Remember my Monza, GMAC?  Uh-huh.  GMAC financing.  For some reason, they get a little upset when you didn't send a payment.  Right.  And GMAC turned into, get me Anthony's car.  Yeah.  I hid my car nine months without one payment. 
[00:10:00]  Nine months.  I was like, 22.  Did the repo guy finally get it?  Finally got it.  Someone ratted me out.  He had the Philadelphia experiment, like, I can cloak this.  I did.  I was trying to, it's not a cloaking device.  Wait.  Slow down.  Yeah.  So you had a car for nine months and they finally got it?  I had a...  How'd you hide it from everyone?  I had a Monza.  Right.  And I couldn't afford the payments.  But I didn't care.  You know, I really didn't go for...  I had a crappy job.  I was a kid.  And the repo guy came to where I worked. 
[00:10:30]  Came to my job.  I was doing some machine shop work for pennies.  And he said, look, I'm taking your car.  And I begged, pleaded.  I'm just like, look, I will pay you.  You come here tomorrow.  It's where I work.  I will give you a check.  Just, I'm working.  You come here.  You could get it tomorrow, but I have a check for you tomorrow.  I then went in and quit my job.  Because I figured I could get another job with a car.  But I couldn't get to the job I had without a car.  So I had to leave. 
[00:11:00]  So I had the car.  Right.  And I just pictured this big bruiser getting there the next day.  Here it is.  I mean, he made it his mission to get this car.  Nine months I went without them getting my car.  I had a different address.  I would park it in train station parking lots.  Take the train to my house.  I mean, this is what I was doing to hide this car.  And then someone ratted me out for like a bounty.  It's almost like Mafia Mom.  And so they finally got my car.  But how did they get it? 
[00:11:30]  I mean, how did they know where you were parking it?  Somebody ratted me out.  You didn't even have a home back then.  Dude, I was great with this.  Yeah, for like a month or two, I was living out of the car.  It was horrible.  So where was the car when they finally repoed it?  It was in one of the train station parking lots.  Someone spotted me.  That guy, that big bruiser guy had a mission.  I effed him over and he was pissed.  You know, speaking of repo men, when Rick was doing his own radio show in Fort Myers.  Was that Max?  Mad Max?  It was the Mad Max show.  Yes, Mad Max. 
[00:12:00]  I love that Mad Max show.  Yeah.  How many names did you have?  I just had me, Anthony.  That's it.  We were talking about this.  When I got together, the first general manager that we worked with said, Anthony, we've got to change your name.  Boys, boobie, boobie, boys, why not make it shwoogie?  It was the shwoogie guy.  The shwoogie guy.  He said that he wanted a different name because Opie is like sort of, it's obviously not a real name.  So he wanted me to have like a name that kind of went with it, the Opie and Dopey show or Slappy and Lappy, something like that. 
[00:12:30]  I'm like, my name's Anthony.  He's not changing his name.  I don't care how hard it is to roll off the tongue Opie and Anthony and open the knee and anthem the name and me when people call up.  Hey, is this the Open to Me and Anthem the name and me and me show?  But people then just said, oh, an A.  Imagine if we changed your name to like, we would have never went for it.  Douche Max.  Max.  Opie and Max.  Yes, Opie and Max.  Hey, Max.  No, I don't know.  I know.  I never had a radio.  All right, drop it. 
[00:13:00]  Jesus Christ.  Not only Max, Mad Max.  Mad Max.  Mad Max.  Were you angry?  Was that it?  No.  Or you were just mad insane man?  Yeah.  He was out of his mind, Max.  That's right.  Out of his mind.  Didn't have a horn, though.  Can I back up, though?  I mean, Opie's been my name since I was 12, too.  I know.  It wasn't radio.  This is not a radio name as well.  But it fits.  All right.  So, when Rick was doing the Mad Max show down at Fort Myers.  Yeah.  It was a great bit.  Oh, yeah.  I used to have the repo man. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  He'd call into the show every time he was about to repo a car.  Well, that's good.  And he'd have his cell phone on.  And live on the radio.  Live on the radio.  The guy was hooking up the car.  I got a Mazda.  Hey, can we steal that bit?  Mad Max?  Or will you be angry?  We don't want to be, you know, considered Mad Max wannabe.  Yeah, we don't want to rip off Mad Max.  Damn it, man.  You took that from Mad Max.  Hey, dude.  I remember Mad Max.  I got tapes down here in Fort Myers.  There's a guy, Mad Max, and he's going to be pissed. 
[00:14:00]  That's a great bit, though.  That is a good one.  We've got to try to steal that from Mad Max.  Mad Max.  Isn't there a Mad Max in Oregon somewhere?  Just about every market.  All right.  So, can we play the promos, Anthony?  Okay.  Now, these are sweepers about the show.  Hold on.  Another girl about the ass contest, though.  We're all over the place here right now.  Chris.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Oh, I thought you were a girl.  Yeah, Chris.  Christine.  Well, sorry I couldn't help you out with that. 
[00:14:30]  I don't have breasts, but, you know.  All right.  So, you're saying the girls aren't coming down for the best ass contest because it's winter  and they don't want to show off their asses.  I think they might be a little white in the old tush there.  They're waiting for that pant to come in.  They might have a little zit going on here and there because their pants have been on all winter.  I definitely think that's the reason.  Well, here's the deal.  We have a road show that we're ready to do.  If we don't get 20 girls down here for the best ass contest in the next few days, road show is off.  Yeah.  And this is going to be a really good road show, so don't make us pull this away.  Hey, didn't Rick do that repo thing in college to win one of the cars? 
[00:15:00]  Didn't he have, like, 15 naked men in a Volkswagen?  That's one of the contests.  That's how the idea started.  Man, Max is circle jerk.  I thought so, Rick, you fag.  All right, Chris.  All right, fellas.  Bye.  Our first ass contest contestant is here.  No way.  She is filling out paperwork as we speak.  Does she have an ass?  She's got an ass.  Bravo.  Who's going to give her cunnilingus?  That's right.  We told her she gets cunnilingus.  Big cap? 
[00:15:30]  I think Mad Max should do the honors.  Mad Max.  See, it's not Rick, so they won't interfere with the manners.  Right.  Mad Max.  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on?  We don't like to be called a repo man.  We are recovery agents, all right?  You don't like to be called a repo man?  No.  It's degrading.  We're recovery agents, all right?  Did you hear about the repo guy that took the...  I just heard this in the news.  He hooked up a car when the guy went into a bank to do some of his banking, 
[00:16:00]  and there were two kids in the car.  He hooks it up and just takes it away.  And now he's in trouble, man.  You can't be taking the kids along with the car.  Hey, Chris, next time you have to recover a car, give us a call, okay?  All right, definitely.  Actually, I got one on the hook now.  On the hook now.  Cool.  What's the story with that one?  He didn't tell you.  It's still very good.  I know, but did the person chase you when you were hooking up the car or anything?  Did he ask you not to tell you?  No, no, not at all.  It was nice and easy.  All right.  Have a go, guys.  Thanks, Chris.  Until he comes out of the mall when it's gone. 
[00:16:30]  Recovery agent.  You're a repo man.  It's a guy with a slim jim.  They're car thieves that actually figured out a way to do it legally.  Did you ever see Repo Man in the movie?  Yeah, it was a little too spacey, a little too weird.  I like it a lot.  A little too weird.  Pablo Picasso would never be called a...  ...hole.  Look at you doing lines from movies.  Thank you.  This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  All right, you want to do the gay sweepers, Anthony?  Yeah, what is this now?  They made sweepers, and it's based on the ambiguously gay duo theme from SNL cartoons. 
[00:17:00]  I don't want Jimmy insulted, because he does all the production for our show, and he does  a great job.  He really does.  But I don't know if we would just throw these sweepers into the general rotation.  I think it would, I don't know, it would perk some people up out there, and I don't  know if we want to go down that road.  The old dirt road.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, let's give a listen, and we'll all judge together.  All right?  We have to decide if these should go into the rotation. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  Okay?  So listen along.  They're really gay.  Great.  They're extremely gay.  That's a winner.  It's our turn in the barrel, Anthony.  Here it goes.  We weren't even going to play them on the air.  Let's hear what Jimmy put together.  I don't even want to push this button.  I haven't heard this yet.  You've heard them?  Oof.  All right.  Oof.  Okay.  Are you ready?  No, but let's go.  All right.  Here.  Are you sure?  Okay.  Here.  Give it a try. 
[00:18:00]  Oof.  Oof.  Oof.  Oof.  Oof.  The M.A.G.  Wesley Gage.  Oh.  I love it already.  Great.  Yes.  Suck it and you whore.  What a mess.  The M.A.G.  W.A.G.  W.A.G.  Duel.  1027 W.A.W. 
[00:18:30]  That's a winner.  All right.  Look.  Mm-hmm.  What?  What is that?  I don't know.  Maybe Jimmy's mad at us.  He gave them to like Ben and Rick and said, here, put these in the rotation.  Oh, yeah.  Just let it fly.  It's me sucking O.B.  All right.  I had to dump out of myself.  Great.  Great thing.  As I was saying, it's me sucking O.B.C. 
[00:19:00]  Great.  Great.  Great sweeper.  Yeah.  That's not real ambiguous.  You pretty much know what's going on.  You're pretty much doing this.  Yeah.  There's no room for doubt.  That's blatant.  He just wanted to throw it in.  He's part of the rotation.  Rotation?  Without us commenting about it.  All of a sudden, we would go to commercial, and that's what you would hear.  Jay from Nutley.  Um, what?  Joe from the Upper West Side.  Way to suck that sea, Ant.  Woo, that's a winner. 
[00:19:30]  Are you kidding?  There's two more, Anthony.  Oh, there's more.  Yeah.  Gay, gay, gay, three to seven.  People are loving this.  Uh, that sucks.  Literally.  Are you kidding?  This guy, that was the funniest effing thing, man.  Oh, yeah, it's funny.  I'm on the receiving end. 
[00:20:00]  Definitely put it in.  Freaking funny.  Hold on a second now, Ant.  We might have a problem.  We might have to put it in rotation.  Max, what's up?  Yeah, Ant, you're not kidding.  You're on the receiving end.  Max.  Are you mad, Max?  I'm very upset.  He's the Mad Max from the Quad Cities.  First of all, Hope, it's guys like you that paved the way for, uh, Gay Marco, Geneseo,  and second of all, those things are freaking funny.  All right, thank you.  Ant, did you swallow?  Yeah, Doug from Springfield.  Doug?  What's up? 
[00:20:30]  You guys are doing your next road show in the city, right?  In the village.  Christopher Street.  Yeah.  What's that?  That's a great sweeper.  Doug wants to ask Ed if he took it all.  Oh, but then.  Stretch your mouth.  Penises.  A giant?  Oh, no, you went like that.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  How's that for a topper?  All right.  Well, now you've got to play the other one.  All right, we'll play the other two. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, great.  Uh, Kevin?  Kevin?  Hello, hello?  He's been standing himself.  It's hot in here.  I'm about to have one of my spells.  Jason, what's going on?  Oh, listen, man.  You guys got to keep that indignantly gay duo, man.  It's the funniest thing I've ever heard.  All I want to know is who's the wife and who's the husband.  Easy.  See?  See, it's our turn in the barrel.  Owen Gay, three to seven.  How many ribs did Anthony take?  Referring to yesterday's show.  Very good.  Anthony, your pottery barn catalog's on the way. 
[00:21:30]  Anthony, you want to hear the second one?  We have three.  You ready yet?  Yeah.  Here's the second one.  It's supposed to just go in a rotation.  Like it's no big deal.  Okay.  Here it is.  Opie and Anthony.  The ambiguously gay duo.  I am not gay.  I want heart C.  I'm terminal fact.  I love C. 
[00:22:00]  Ass nut.  Gay oral.  Try your C in this mouth.  It's an F vest with man junk.  Very nice.  Junk.  Man ass.  Glows oral.  Ass.  Penis.  Get your balls out.  The Opie and Anthony show.  We want your penis.  The ambiguously gay duo.  Oh, my God.  Steve was scared to even play it for me. 
[00:22:30]  You've got to be kidding.  Steve goes, uh, are you in a good mood?  Because I want to play something for you.  Yeah.  Well, you have to understand,  Jim's been working on these for about four months.  These are all the drops and stuff that...  Is he going to get mad?  No.  No, no.  This is...  I don't think he's mad.  I think he was just waiting to find out  what you guys were going to say about him.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yes.  But you're right.  I was a little apprehensive to play these for you this morning.  Well, that one didn't have an act.  No. 
[00:23:00]  Well, there you go.  Adam, putting it in perspective for us.  I'm trying to help.  Great.  Next.  Hey, one of you guys guesting on Will and Grace.  Easy.  Next week.  Thank you.  Frank?  Yeah.  Hey, you're on the radio.  Hey.  We'll be kind of on about a bit.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  Keith, you're next on NW. 
[00:23:30]  What's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  Yo.  You're on the radio.  Let's go.  Hey, what's going on, dude?  I saw Ron and Fez Ron at noon.  All right.  Thank you.  No problem.  Ant, any comments about the second one?  Anthony's starring in Cabaret next week.  Anthony, do you want to take the wiffle ball bat challenge?  Charles Nelson, Ant.  Ant, you still haven't returned your copy of the first wife's club. 
[00:24:00]  Pitcher or catcher.  Spitter, swallow.  Mike, what's going on?  What's going on?  I want to know if Owen A stands for oral and anal.  We're getting killed.  That's funny.  See, we share and this is what happens.  E from New York.  Not only does it suck, but it also blows.  Yes, it does.  You ready for the third one?  No.  Well, here it is. 
[00:24:30]  Hey, Anthony, let's get naked.  No, never.  Take that shirt off there.  No, just go along with it.  You are gay.  I hate bars.  He loves junk.  I'm pulling out my junk.  Nice.  Now I'm ready for action.  You're obviously a stud.  Let's get naked.  Opie, could you take my pants off?  Yeah.  Naked?  He's just what I imagined him to be.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  I'm going to ask like a nine-year-old boy.  Yes.  Screw me, Opie.  Okay.  Dick.  Ass.  Painful.  Dick.  Ass.  Painful.  I love junk.  I love ass.  We're all men jumping all over each other.  I'm going to touch myself.  The Amigee Whistler Game.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  That's a winner.  You see, okay, none of that.  Why am I taking it this day? 
[00:25:30]  But you know what?  That had a character, Archie.  You were very coy in the beginning.  I was coy in the beginning.  You were a little coy in the beginning.  And then I opened up to things.  There was a whole little story going on there.  Is your car ready, Adam?  Unbelievable.  I'd take it in that one.  You took it in two out of the three.  And the second one wasn't even...  What's that?  Whatever, Ben?  What did Ben say?  You're giving us more drops, Ant.  Just keep talking.  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  I can't believe you're just going...  But I'm taking it in that.  Like you prefer to be giving it?  No, no.  I prefer that they not even be made.  But if they are there, how come I've got to take it in two of them?  And then in the second one, it's not like anyone's taking it.  It's just kind of a vague gay thing.  Opie doesn't take it at all.  No.  You're his best.  The first and third one you're taking is that.  Your complaint is Opie's selfish.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:26:30]  I get no payback.  Oh, brother.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  I want to know when you're going to be on the next episode of Queer and Spoke.  I want to make sure I see that one.  I like to...  I want to know if Anthony takes his good hope.  Hey.  All right.  Oh, my God.  So there you have it.  That's awful.  I mean, I understand Jimmy worked on it a long time.  Just, I find it a little strange also. 
[00:27:00]  He decides to go in that direction.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey.  I just want to welcome Anthony to the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  All right.  Great.  And I'm the head plane thrower down at the Glory Hole, and I want to divide him down for  his first drink.  No problem.  All right.  Let's keep it.  We're getting killed on the phones now.  Tim, what's up?  Howdy.  Hey.  Baggots.  Chocolat stops in 30 minutes.  Get chocolat.  Oh, man.  Fred, what's up?  Yeah, I finally learned on O&A that Anthony has no gag reflex. 
[00:27:30]  That's good.  I'm really enjoying this segment.  My God.  Dave?  Yes?  Hey.  I heard Vaseline is the new sponsor of your guy's show.  Yeah.  Oh.  Congratulations.  Hey, Cindy...  Mike?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, O&A.  Hey.  Hey, I thought it was great.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You guys have a great show. 
[00:28:00]  Gabe?  I think you opened up your demographic.  Gabe?  Shut up, Adam.  Amongst other things.  Your car's outside.  Gabe.  I came to plug, but it has a double meaning now.  Yes, Dave.  Gabe?  Steve?  Hop on, Adam.  Steve, what's up?  Everyone else, Dave?  Hey.  You guys should change your name to Neil and Bob.  Whew.  Well, no, good job, bud, Jimmy.  Out of all the clips we've done on this show to put together... 
[00:28:30]  I would guess thousands of clips.  You decide to go in that direction.  I want to defend myself.  All my sound bites came from the Sally the F slut doll thing.  There's no defending.  We're going to try, though.  Put together like that.  Oh, what do you think?  Everybody's thinking, wow, what show was that from?  Where they were, you know, banging each other.  They must have hung a mic in the office.  I missed that one. 
[00:29:00]  Because all the clips were put together so smoothly.  Joe, what's up?  What's going on?  I'm just going to tell you guys that the XFL has turned you guys from tight ends to wide receivers.  Oh, that old gag.  Thank you, Bob Nelson.  All right.  All right, let's take a break.  Great job.  You know, suddenly, Hospitaliano ain't so bad.  You know, when it's my turn in the barrel, I can handle it.  Hospitaliano. 
[00:29:30]  Can you guys leave us alone?  We took our turn in the barrel.  Doug?  Yeah, this is what happens when you wash too much eyes.  Oh, that must be it.  Rick Fox wants your number.  Rob?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  What's up, man?  I want to know when Anthony's doing a duet with Eminem.  We're getting killed, Dad.  Greg, yeah.  Like you didn't expect it.  Let's play this. 
[00:30:00]  Greg.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I just want to know when you guys are playing the next game, but what's in my mouth?  Oh, no.  All right.  That was good.  All right.  Thanks.  So, I guess the answer's no?  I guess the answer's no.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  The answer's no.  What?  All the...  No, we're not Siegfried and Roy.  Oh, very funny, right? 
[00:30:30]  The crying game.  That's good.  Jerry.  What's going on?  What's up, Jerry?  I wanted to know who got hit in the face with more balls.  Yogi Berra or Anthony?  Good one.  You got me.  Ass F.  That's good.  That's exactly what we expected, so I guess the answer would be no.  Is 30 Rock a gay bar? 
[00:31:00]  People are so funny.  Jim, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Oh, I'm just curious.  Did you ever write Anthony's name in cement?  Oh.  Let's punch out.  Let's punch out, Anthony.  Punch out.  Do we have the girl for the ass contest?  The girl's ass contest?  Oh, what do you care?  Did you fart?  I smell Vaseline. 
[00:31:30]  Savage.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, are you going to be taping Match Game 2001 tonight?  Oh, how's that for a topper?  Okay.  All right.  Let's move on, okay?  Good, good job.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony of Boobies and Whores show.  By 7 o'clock, I think you're going to say, you know what?  I had a pretty good time today.  1-0-2-7, WNEW. 
[00:32:00]  In studio, Adam Prar.  Hello.  Performing at town hall tonight with a bunch of our pals, Anthony.  Tickets still available.  We're all going after the show tonight.  The Jerry Red Wilson benefits.  And tickets available.  Yep.  And it's a great lineup.  Dave Attell, Lewis Black, Colin Flynn, Kevin Meany, Jim Brewer, Greg Fitzsimmons, and a bunch of other guys.  Yourself.  And me.  You guys are all going to get, what, seven minutes?  Yeah, seven to ten minutes. 
[00:32:30]  That's all right, though.  It's going to be cool.  Yeah.  Town hall.  You're right.  Town hall.  You can buy tickets at the door, I believe.  I believe so, yeah.  If that's not true, someone should call us and let us know.  And it's for a good cause.  That's what we're assuming, and we're all going down right after the program today, okay?  Yes.  Also, I think this is the end of our friendship with Adam Prar.  Why?  What happened?  He's going to be on TV tomorrow night.  You know how they get Anthony.  I know.  That's it.  It doesn't matter.  You guys grew up together.  Ant and I have seen this time and time again. 
[00:33:00]  Really?  Yes.  You get too big for the radio show.  It's just happening.  I don't want to go.  You have to.  I don't want to go.  You have to move on.  I want to stay here.  We're talking about The Job.  The Job.  Starring Dennis Leary, Adam Prar, Lenny Clark.  Bill Nunn, Diane Prar, Julian Acosta, John Ortiz.  And it's getting good reviews.  It's getting really good reviews.  And it's premiering tomorrow night at 9.30 after the Drew Carey Show.  Yeah.  Look at you.  Nice placement.  White hot comic, Adam Prar.  Oh, you read that in the paper?  Yeah, we did.  No, that's just what I say all the time. 
[00:33:30]  Really?  We saw that.  You going to leave that open?  You going to use the word white and hot open after what just happened?  No.  All right.  Very good, though.  Look at this.  Yeah, my mother saw the...  My parents of the New York Times, they were on the TV thing.  Yeah.  The picture.  My father calls me up and goes,  Hey, De Niro, did the ship come in yet?  They're waiting, man.  Oh, God.  Yeah, they're waiting.  And my mother goes, she's going to watch the show. 
[00:34:00]  She goes, and you know, Wednesday, the program is on.  And Wednesday night, they have to bring the garbage cans out.  But I'm going to make your father do it.  I don't want to see people me dragging pails.  I'm the mother.  You should see out of the parents' house.  I swear to God.  Tony Soprano's house.  Oh, it's decorated by the same people that did the casino at Caesars Palace.  There's like peeing fountains.  Even the outside, Tony Soprano's house.  Come on.  Inside, Tony Soprano's house.  What does your father do?  What business? 
[00:34:30]  He's in the construction.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  As far as you know.  Enough said.  Yeah, I don't feel like talking about that anymore myself.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to call up.  Oh, who's got a problem with my taste?  What?  Oh, yeah.  I have a tastefully appointed home.  Everyone likes red shag and stucco.  Yeah, the stucco, the red shag, the wrought iron.  Oh, the statue of Sinatra.  Right.  Adam Plastic on the furniture?  No.  They don't go that bad.  What about the red velvet couch thing?  All right, fine.  I've been in your mother's house. 
[00:35:00]  Well, what?  Nothing.  I can't think of that.  See, it's a nice contemporary house.  There's a red velvet couch in the house?  Yeah.  What about a fireplace?  Look at that.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Poster of Jerry Veil.  What other friggin' house have you been in that has a real, authentic slot machine?  And I swear to God.  We got a slot machine in the basement.  And I'm like, I remember going there.  I'm down there.  I go, hey, you know, can I play?  And Big Joe's just like, yeah, put some money in. 
[00:35:30]  It's like, what?  No, it's not just a game for anything?  No, you put money in.  What am I, running a charity here?  All right.  That's funny.  He fell off the truck.  This ain't the fresh air fund.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you guys make money off of it, or is it just kind of fair?  Only Anthony comes in.  I've never seen it pay off.  I've never seen that machine pay out.  Oh, he fixed it.  Yeah, he sure did.  Hey, he comped your meal, didn't he?  He did.  Yeah.  He did.  He comped my meal at the house.  I had dinner.  I had a couple free drinks.  It was great.  I was there hanging out at the bar for two hours, playing the slots, and I got raided. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  You got dinner.  I got dinner.  I got comped, and I saw a show.  It was Adam.  It was me.  But it's a white hot comic.  We had to throw him out when he ordered a hooker.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the Atlantic City.  Well, you know.  Tell that story.  What story?  Everyone knows Adam.  He's been in Vegas and Atlantic City.  He's done some gigs there.  Sure.  We went to see him at the Tropicana in Atlantic City a few years back. 
[00:36:30]  This is a good one.  And this is right, you know, you were just starting to hit.  You were red hot.  Not quite white hot yet.  Red hot comic.  Oh, what a dick.  You should have a vein running up your face right now.  So now he, now what does he say?  What does he say?  Come see me at the Tropicana in Atlantic City.  I want to show my pals a good time.  Like my pal, Tropicana, this is great.  So we trudged to Atlantic City. 
[00:37:00]  It's like two in the morning.  I don't even know what it was.  We were catching you the next day.  So I'm figuring this is great.  We're going to get comped at the Tropicana.  Nice.  Nice room.  It's Adam.  We go there.  He's staying at some fleabag hotel about five miles from the Tropicana.  What's the math?  You're thinking you guys were going to be all hooked up, right?  Just the talent doesn't stay at the hotel.  Meaning, like saying it to me like I should have known.  You know, he didn't tell me that we weren't staying at the Tropicana.  You called my father to find out where I was staying. 
[00:37:30]  He goes, where is he, in the Tropicana?  My father goes, they don't put the help up at the hotel.  The help.  So we go to this fleabag hotel.  It was, it had one of those Murphy beds to come out of the wall.  Yeah, out of the wall.  We had to sleep on the floor.  And I wasn't heavy enough to keep it down.  I didn't know I had to sleep the other way.  So every time I inhaled, the bed came up a little bit.  It was awful.  And then he goes, oh, okay, well now we'll go, we'll get some food.  Here we go, we're going to get food comped.  It's on me, don't worry about it.  He's like a player.  I'm a player, baby. 
[00:38:00]  We go, he hands out these food vouchers to all of us.  Get online with the food vouchers.  I look at them, they're outdated.  The food vouchers are expired.  We have to go to the employee cafeteria.  I'm picturing we're going to be at the Trop, we're going to sit at the table,  Tony Vail sending over a bottle for us, I don't know.  We go to the kitchen help.  We're going through the kitchen with these trays and expired vouchers.  Adam, last minute, tells me, say you're with the band. 
[00:38:30]  I go, what band?  Just say you're with the band.  Now I feel like I'm committing a crime.  Don't look nobody in the eye.  Don't look anyone in the eye.  Say you're with the band.  I have this, like, ulcer.  I'm getting all this anxiety because now I'm feeling like, uh-oh, I'm somewhere I'm not supposed to be.  Yeah, and this was supposed to be fun.  This was, I'm picturing the Trop.  There's whores.  We're gambling.  VIP.  It's great.  VIP treatment.  It's like casino.  Mo Green, drug chips, everyone in the house.  Drug chips.  Michael, how are you?  Michael, how are you? 
[00:39:00]  Don't look nobody in the eye.  You're with the band.  Don't order anything hot because they've got to look at the vouchers.  Put a face down and get a sandwich.  Cold wrapped up sandwiches.  So we skate through that one.  I forgot the name of the band you said to say.  It was some mariachi band or something.  And we work ourselves through that.  We didn't even see the show.  Why?  I didn't even get, I don't know.  You didn't have, like, tickets for that?  He wasn't even in the big room at the Trop.  Nah, I was in the comedy club.  He was in the comedy club in the Trop. 
[00:39:30]  And we got drunk and gambled.  Yeah, we did.  When we won.  Once.  And then lost everything.  You know, you always look at the dark side of things.  Did you win?  It was how I woke up.  It's cold and as a mother eff outside.  I'm broke, hungover.  I haven't eaten anything but a crappy sandwich from your crappy vouchers.  You're in a Fleabag hotel.  Fleabag hotel.  I leave destitute.  Barely enough gas in the car to get back.  That sucked.  And now you're driving a Lexus.  Shut up.  No thanks to you. 
[00:40:00]  White hot comic.  All right.  Now he's got a TV show.  He's doing benefits.  Well, we went to Jersey to see NASCAR.  That was your idea.  No.  We went to see a heat stroke.  No, no, no, no.  Trying to carbon monoxide poisoning.  You stand next to the jet car, you get a buzz as they go by.  You didn't say that.  That was the bison, not me, who dragged us to, what was that place that does the top fuel?  English Town, New Jersey.  For the drag racing.  The most heinous day amount. 
[00:40:30]  It was 110 degrees on tar with top fuel fumes all over the place.  That wasn't me.  Wow.  Funny cars?  Funny cars.  Nothing was funny that day.  No funny cars?  No, they were funny cars, but nothing was funny.  I tell you, I thought I was going to die of heat of prostration.  Well, don't look at me.  I didn't want to go.  Well, don't blame it on me.  God, you guys, like, how long have you been there?  That wasn't me.  I didn't want to be bickering.  We got to the best ad contest, Anthony. 
[00:41:00]  For a long time.  Yeah.  We have the first, don't make me tell your wedding story.  Oh, please.  The reception at OTB.  We've heard the wedding story.  At OTB.  Should have known right there.  Yeah.  The wedding story is a great story.  We leave where I get married, go right to the bar, and it's our place in Best because  of Preakness.  No, no, the wedding procession was two air conditioning trucks and his car.  Yeah.  And he got married in some Justice of the Pieces house in where, Port Jeff, on a green  shag rug.  North Port.  In the guy's basement. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  And I'm standing witness to this, and he's standing there, and his wife's standing there,  and his brother and everything, and the minister's wife is watching Barnaby Jones in the next room  with the door open, and she's telling us, keep it down, he's chasing him.  Do you take this woman?  I was so hoping, recently, I've been thinking about that, going, maybe he wasn't a real  Justice of the Peace.  Wouldn't that be a kick in the ass?  I gotta look that guy up.  You know what pissed me off is I lost the pool by one year.  Did you? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  And I lost on the Preakness, though.  Wow.  Yeah.  That was on OTB, the Preakness.  That's funny.  I should have known.  I don't know if this is for real, but let's go to Snatch.  Snatch, what's up?  Snatch?  Snatch?  Yes?  What's up?  I'm about to repo a car.  I gotta sit in the parking lot.  I'm getting...  This guy's a dentist.  Come on.  I swear to God, it's 98 and 50.  All right, and you're repoing a dentist's car?  Yep.  Right from his office parking lot, or like this whole office building.  And you're going to hook it up right now, live on the show? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, if you want me to.  Yeah, let's do it.  Okay.  Explain what you're doing.  Listen, I do it two ways.  What I do is I have my partner hook it up.  I go and tell the guy I'm taking it and make it come out.  Slow down.  Hold on.  Okay.  Don't curse, all right?  Okay, sorry about that.  So what?  You're going to go tell the dentist you're taking this car?  And my partner's putting it on the back of the tow truck.  Well, do it live on the air.  Let's go.  Okay.  All right.  I'm rolling up on it right now.  My partner's going to back up to it.  I'm walking into the office.  Okay.  All right.  I'll keep it in front right in my top pocket.  I don't know if this is legit, but we'll... 
[00:43:00]  Just...  Can you believe that the guy's name?  Don't say the guy's name.  Okay.  Where are you?  How close to the dentist are you?  I'm...  We're in the parking lot.  My buddy's pulling the truck up right now.  I'm walking into the building.  All right.  Yeah, I'll just use his first name.  Yeah, you can use his first name.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A live repo.  Take your place, Anthony. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  Come on, Snatch.  Where are you?  Yeah, I'm going into the dentist's office, but I'm going to the dentist's office.  All right.  My guy's looking at the car as we speak.  Sounds like Scorch, yeah.  I'm walking in right now.  Only dude repo.  Kingdom of nudist repo, sir.  She's walking into the dentist's office.  The phone's in your pocket?  Well, now he can't talk to us.  Hello, hello, hello. 
[00:44:00]  Hello, hello, hello.  He's probably...  He probably can't answer, but maybe we'll hear from...  Angelo?  Angelo?  Angelo.  Angelo?  Um, I'm trying to keep this open.  Your car's being repossessed.  Your car's being repossessed.  Do you want to take yourself out of it?  All right.  I'll go out in the parking lot.  You need to come out.  All right.  I'm going to get on the truck right now. 
[00:44:30]  He's coming.  Come on.  Just like that.  And the guy's not losing it.  Oh, no, no.  He's in his office.  I'm trying to be a little professional.  How many payments?  I don't lose it, man.  I do this every day.  I do like five or ten a day.  How many payments is the dentist behind that you're repoing this car?  Let's see.  Usually it's a two or three.  This gentleman is exactly...  Last thing was made in December.  So he's three. 
[00:45:00]  Maybe it's Alan...  Maybe it's Alan Sniffen's car.  Is it a radio dentist, Alan Sniffen?  No.  All right.  So what's going on now?  He's...  I guess putting something in somebody's mouth and coming outside.  I just walked back outside.  My guy's dragging up on the flatbed as we speak.  The car's being...  This guy has wow stickers on it.  The car has wow stickers on it?  No, the flatbed doesn't.  Oh, all right.  Good.  I don't want you to repo in a listener's car.  We got a lot of them on cars.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  Actually, before they were easy to get, we used to try to take the wow stickers off the cars.  All right.  I'm going to put you on hold in case anything else happens, all right?  Okay.  All right.  There you go.  The guy's repoing your car live on our show.  Boy, this repo guy really brings the magic of indebtedness to life, doesn't he?  Ponderous.  Well, that's why he's a repo guy.  Let's go to Rick.  Rick, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  I just want to say that I never heard of Adam until you guys had him on your show.  And I saw him do the...  I saw him on the Comedy Central.  That's funny as hell. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, yeah.  Like, he did this one bit with asthma.  Like, he said that...  He's like, yeah, yes, I met this girl with asthma.  And then he was doing the humping thing.  Like, she was calling his name, whatever.  That's funny as hell.  What?  And I just want to say...  Isn't that Jay Moore's bit?  No, no, man, Adam.  And I just want to say that I called earlier, and then whatever douchebag answers your phone  is hung up on me, and I was trying to call up to compliment him.  Isn't that Jay Moore's bit?  Do you do an asthma bit?  Yeah, I do a bit about making love to this woman who had asthma.  I think Jay Moore's ripping you off. 
[00:46:30]  What?  Jay's doing that bit?  I think he is.  Get Jay on the phone.  How does the bit go?  Oh, I have a tremendous ego.  I was making love to this woman.  She had an asthma attack, and I thought I was a god.  That's right in the middle of...  Who's the king?  Who's the king?  In the middle of...  That's it.  Breathe, baby.  Adam does all my material that I wrote.  All right, let's take a break.  We've got to get...  I never got an Alexis.

But now mine seems tame compared to those.  Yeah, I mean, you just kind of touched on it.  That's okay, but the ones we played for Jim were way over the top.

[00:59:30]  10 10 wins or anthony was and they were talking about napster 10 10 wins yeah and and they're  saying uh well napster might be gone but plenty of other sites popping up to get your free music  i'm john montone and uh they don't realize you know do a little research pop the napster up put a song  title in you'll get it you'll get it you'll get uh songs from bands such as metallic assault 
[01:00:00]  that's a biggie i left my ass off when i saw that metallic assault because obviously metallic are  one of the banned bands from napster one that they had to filter out so uh they filtered it out but  people are making up their own names and and you could put in uh what the hell i put in uh ride the  lightning and it came up ride t lightning comes up you download it there's ride the lightning 
[01:00:30]  metallica napster is still there and it's still just as good as it was last year just as good still  just as easy every song you were downloading you can download there is no change to napster anthony  a quick example of what you're talking about we put in metallic assault on napster under artists  and what comes up seek and destroy sanitarium battery enter sandman of course uh welcome home 
[01:01:00]  and it keeps going on yeah metallic assault and that's just one there's plenty of other ones you  just put a song title in the title you don't even have to change it you do not have to change the song  title and it'll pop up uh dave what's up hi uh i did a flash animation for you guys a long time ago  a cartoon and you put it up on one of your sites but through boogie stuff the real stuff i do for  work is all animation and video and i can put it to his music and it would be sick well uh why don't 
[01:01:30]  you just uh stay on hold and we'll get your your number and you guys can hook up and see what happens  all right all right man hold on all right thanks give david's uh number there wow 12 of my files are  being violated i love napster metallica it's right there  kill them all she can destroy look at that  hey hey hey hold on brett let's go to sean sean radio sean what's up hey what's going on guys hey 
[01:02:00]  i want to talk about napster and uh i was trying to download the new tool disk last night  and uh i've got all kinds of weird ascii symbols and all kinds of acts like that going on all kinds  of what that was just like is that the filter or how it's working or what's up with that  uh you gotta back up because i didn't understand what you said what did you put in yeah what happened  when you try to get the tool album um i i started to download and all the like the cute songs came up 
[01:02:30]  with like ascii symbols and like uh the whole interface got all got all screwy steve is shaking  his head steve from fabrymusic.com uh for real no if um if napster has successfully blocked this song  you're just gonna you're not gonna see it that's all oh it's the program itself yeah there's an issue  with you with your program i'm downloading the tool uh song right now yeah they they're they're  not able to block out the thousands of songs that the record companies are providing the record  companies under this um amended little uh little agreement yeah yeah agreement thank you uh have 
[01:03:00]  said that the record companies not only have to provide the artist the song title and the copyright  but they have to provide the alternate spellings of that song and there's so many alternate spellings  they can't block them all out now and they just got 135 000 new song titles and artists on friday  and there's only i think 60 people at the napster corporation that are doing this so the people  that are using napster they're too smart for this they're already working around it yeah i got you  all right all right over now bye accoladum does a kick-ass version of ride the lightning 
[01:03:30]  metallica backwards damn from hobo uh rob what's up hey what's up guys hey i was just gonna say that uh  all the metallica uh songs they should put it under a heading like f wars or something like that  just to dig the knife in a little deeper you know i'm sure there are some songs under that title  that would be great hey last week i called in to you guys and when they went to connect us uh  something happened we didn't get connected and you called me rob swab that was very hurtful of you 
[01:04:00]  opi i'm sorry very hurtful i apologize you didn't have to be so hurtful thank you bye rob when you put  in large you get a bunch of metallica songs really yeah how are they going to stop that they're not the  only way they're going to stop that is to completely shut it down everyone thinks it's  stopped but it's not metallica where the l's are ones instead of uh l's that works too john montone  thought napster was done it's done napster finished i'm john montone where am i going to download my 
[01:04:30]  songs hello somehow i don't think he even uses the napster yeah joe i need the new tool hey joe  joe uh hey hello the guy who said hello hello he was just there a minute ago what happened all right  joe thank you the guy who wanted to talk about uh nugent's idea on napster is he still on the phone  what's nugent's idea hello we'll never know all right let's uh move on to dave dave what's up hey

[01:06:30]  into napster why can't we just have naps at the pot and share our weed with each other hey we had  we had joe purry on the air last week he admitted that he does the napster yeah but i don't think they  were too uh happy about it but he's using it yeah he's kind of hypocritical hypocritical i don't think  they have to worry either it's all these bands see if you're a band that's making an s load of  money and your albums are selling you don't have to worry about napster if you're a band that isn't 
[01:07:00]  making a lot of money you love being on napster because it gets you out there right so what's the  problem lars joe what's going on hello this tool the nugent guy  you are the biggest dick he called back the nugent guy i'm here  and then he answers his radio 40 seconds later hello hello somebody call the iron  mike t what's going on what's up guys hey i was just gonna say man i put in f lars on napster

[01:44:00]  complain my god michael opie i called yesterday you redeem yourself at dsa's carnage  the ass contest wait wait wait wait slow down what happened to carnage yeah what happened  this bandage boy whatever i was yeah i don't even go into that the best like you bet the best contest 
[01:44:30]  is the ass contest all right i mean there's nothing better than a well-shaped rump without a doubt  the other guy who called before is probably queer wants to see man ass all right because i can imagine  the future would you bring in there it's going to be definitely tight and anthony i joined mobster.com  i'm coming after you yeah all right i got the points and you're dead thank you michael i should  have asked his name i thought i was going to break some bad news today for somebody yeah you were 
[01:45:00]  supposed to do that some guy wanted to get a divorce today and another guy just wanted to  fire his babysitter yeah that guy chickened out i guess called up this is a great thing because uh  opie's a real prick and uh if you want someone fired or you want to announce that um agreed with me  yesterday what i'm not going down this road i know but whatever ben was into it stinky was into  it jesse was into it people were into it people were inspired by you and they were calling up and  saying opie i would like you to fire this person or i would like you to um tell my wife that i want a 
[01:45:30]  divorce and uh i thought it was a good idea i think you'd be perfect for the job i got a new contest  what guess who the next person's  guess who the next you bet you better you better ease up there paly why you just better slow down  can i say it bad i'd uh i'd um yeah just hearing things just hearing things i'm sure um 
[01:46:00]  little drudge jr i'll have the info all right anthony yeah top 25 guy movies of all time  what magazine is putting this out no but this list is good remember the last list we did last one  sucked it sucked a lot of movies didn't make the the the list and everything uh it's a new magazine  called max to mad max to the max magazine i thought it was mad max magazine m-a-x-x magazine 
[01:46:30]  it's a good way to spell it that mad max spelled with two x's there are so many guy magazines out  there i know and uh this one has a uh a list top 25 guy movies of all time do you agree with this  list anthony um i see uh a couple of omissions but um what is one name an omission  name a movie that should be on this list that's not on the list all right top 25 guy oh i 
[01:47:00]  alien alien guy movie hell yeah that was a good one how about uh platoon platoon okay  ridges of madison county  i'd go with rollerball myself rollerball that was a good one what's the one with the uh slap shot yeah  slap shot's a great guy movie didn't make the list i think what they're going for are like legendary 
[01:47:30]  movies really good ones that really make an impact slap shot wasn't good yeah it was good but i don't  think it rates up there for the 25 best guy movies but something like uh alien that was great all right  so you want to hear the list anthony yes all right we'll count them down okay smoky and the bandit not on  the list well that's not really that's a good that was a pretty good movie though bill guy movie bill  yeah what's up guys let's see smoking a bandit's not on that list either huh kind of bummed huh yeah

[02:12:30]  manhole covers just when it's about to go you do it all the time you know you see them if you're  steaming or something you walk over them you don't think about it keith the cop says this happens all  the time all the time all the time keith manhole covers are just uh blowing up yeah it's like  especially in the winter time you get a lot of the salt and everything gets down into the con  ed stuff they're blowing up all the time people walk over them they get clipped every once in a  while so you got to figure with all the people walking around in manhattan that uh when something like 
[02:13:00]  this happens someone's bound to be on it or under it but it's got it's got to suck to be the guy  i mean the odds of something like that happening are just ridiculous right it goes through your head  you're just like why look at me i'm 40 feet in the air why can't you be the lottery guy no you're the  guy that the you're the guy cover explodes under right now how many uh well a lot of people on top  of them or they're getting hit by them when they come down no a couple people have been like right on 
[02:13:30]  top of them when they've gone a lot of times it happens because cars are parked over them you get them that  they you know hit the bottom of the cars wreck the bottom of the cars well that's no big deal  but being catapulted is a whole different story i don't get the odds how about it hitting someone  though like when it comes down big manhole pop i've never heard of that when when they explode  people call for for blocks they think it's like an earthquake or something yeah pretty wild ouch  i don't get that odd thing though yeah what are the odds yeah i mean a lot of people try to win the 
[02:14:00]  lottery right and somebody does right why can't you be that lucky no you're the other guy that's  lucky that you you were on top of the manhole you read these stories in the papers all the time what  about like the person that dies because a crane falls the other crane accidents a crane accident  goes it's crashing through your bedroom and kills you what are the odds of that happening but it  happens it happens you just kind of just gonna roll with it is there an actual book of these things  about the the odds of these things happening like strange obscurity sure people have all the odds on 
[02:14:30]  it happens all the time you know people write a book about anything but i mean i couldn't you fly in  the air and what the hell would you think i think it was i think it was giuliani's crackdown on jaywalking  yeah i'll put uh jack in the boxes underneath the manholes manhole i like the way that sounds  you think he's popping them popping manholes i just love the popping manhole jr what's going on 
[02:15:00]  isn't that like winning the lottery when you do get hit by one of these manhole covers  you're getting paid for life but yeah of course the odds have got to be uh pretty similar what you  know why can't you win the lottery instead you're the guy that gets catapulted by the manhole cover  yeah but you're winning the lottery then because you're suing the city in carnet and god knows  everybody you're gonna make a lot of money you see it with the if if you live well yeah you got  the guy uh this guy did live he says i give thanks to god said said uh shaking thanks to his lawyer 
[02:15:30]  what he's gonna give thanks to his lawyer yes yes he will all right thank you jr thank you  just trying to get more details here anthony says uh firman pina 40 of brooklyn pina said he was on  his way to work as a food runner at a local steakhouse around 5 p.m when he stepped out onto 8th avenue  at 50th street that's pretty close to here my left foot stepped on the edge of the manhole and  all i remember is that it blew up and the cover threw me on the floor he said my back was in pain  pina manhole this is getting very weird here hey he was treated at a hospital for his injury how high 
[02:16:00]  up did he go do you think uh no no it's just he was walking it blew up from under him the explosion  was so loud a worker on the 33rd floor of the morgan stanley dean winner uh building on broadway  broadway nearly a block away said she and her colleagues felt it no that was just the stock  market crashing right and nothing to do with the manhole that's a winner 
[02:16:30]  well just like the key said though it's like an explosion uh they felt the jolt the lights uh  flickered and the computer flicker flickered yeah for blocks what's the worst building shake and  everything you know it's got to be worse than this woman just cashed in the one that uh got hit by the  light when the parade was had the big balloon oh yeah thanksgiving parade and the cat in the hat  knocked down one of the uh street lights now there you go there's another one of those weird situations 
[02:17:00]  she lived through it but i mean she's she was lucky to be alive she got the brain damaged she's probably  not going to be able to enjoy the money she got from the city oh well her family will the family  will hey what what about that story remember we we never got to we were laughing about it though in  the uh in the office that guy who's taking a leak on the runway oh yeah what the guy's taking a leak  on the side of a runway and he gets hit by a plane the plane crashes into plane crashed  plane crashed while it was coming in for a landing on him taking a leak let's see the odds are pretty 
[02:17:30]  great that's going to happen if you decide to take a leak on a regular on a runway well he was just off  the runway and the plane kind of missed the runway hit him taking a leak some people that happens to  like you're driving around you see uh rocks falling into the road didn't that happen to that intern  yesterday didn't he uh that's gonna happen yeah he was catapulted by a manhole manhole cover he should  have used that one damn that was me jose hey how you doing guys uh i'm not getting this what would  make a manhole cover explode yeah keith said what it's just kind of the pressure builds and it's 
[02:18:00]  got a pop there's a lot of stuff down there electrical and the like you said the salt  through the wires i'm a cop not a kind ed worker but i mean you know the salt gets down and gets in  the old wiring stuff like hundreds of years old down there and then if you got some gas down there  leaking and you get a spark it's over johnny so there's just like an explosion and then the manhole  cover just pushes right off also they have a lot of transformers down there because there's you  know no telephone poles um yeah just to let you know um i'm gonna make uh the uh ashley and olsen 
[02:18:30]  twins uh reference of the day oh hey how about that do i want anything mary kate and ashley  olsen reference of the day thank you thank you jose no problem all right the street continues tina  what's going on oh nay what's up tina you're not gonna believe it i was in manhattan for the last three  days and i was in midtown last night i was walking to dinner with my cousin and we saw a bubbling manhole  and she says it all the time i've been in the city i've never seen this before and we were

[02:20:00]  groups play the lotto okay you know they're looking for that big win when i go when i go into a store  or something now it's it's insane i got to stand behind people that can't speak english and want  either uh lottery or phone cards give me the good one and all you want to do is pay for your daily  news and it takes forever you can't you can't have a separate line for that crap give me uh three

[02:23:30]  due to the salt yeah and we just finished repairing them and it was a gas leak and the manhole took  straight up i went up about 15 feet so joey you're trying to say the manhole uh exploded i exploded i  just went straight up like a rocket shot you backwards huh a matter of fact i'm a pretty heavy  guy and it turned me completely around and i came down backwards i landed on my back i did some damage 
[02:24:00]  to my leg i ripped the two tops of both my fingers off and joey this uh happens all the time  well i'll tell you the truth not many people are ever on top of it seems like a delay yeah i know  i know all right joey thank you okay you didn't hit hit the back of your head did you  no no i didn't look back at my head at all all right buddy thank you let's go to greg greg you're  next on any w greg yo what's up you're on the radio hey hey listen i just want to tell you real 
[02:24:30]  first there's a book i heard about last week called worst case scenarios and it's it's how to survive  i mean everything you possibly imagine and i'm sure manhole covers are in there explosions  falling cranes falling out of trees hanging from cliffs poison shooting stabbing alligator bites  it's a really bizarre book you guys can check it out uh cool sounds like a good read  worst case scenario thanks greg uh i don't think there's any way you can really do anything to  avoid being hit by a crane if you're walking around don't walk under crane we had a question 
[02:25:00]  and the old lady got answered the old lady with the crane that was what about two years ago  she didn't even leave her house no you're laying in bed watching her her cereals watching my programs  listen a crane just comes through the wall through the ceiling and kills her smashes into her what  he wasn't even on the dangerous streets of uh survives that we never got our answer to the  question they're building a huge building over here next to our building and uh of course they use these  cranes to build it and the higher the building goes up the higher the crane goes up so they could 
[02:25:30]  bring the material i've all seen these cranes all over the city i want to hear from a construction guy  how the f do they get the crane down how do they get the crane down gentlemen i mean i told anthony it  obviously has to come apart yeah but even if it comes apart then you got to crane it down they can't  break it up into pieces that guys can carry down in buckets my second guess was they just make it part  of the building you just encase it in the building and leave the crane every time you build a new  building i don't know i mean these cranes are up there really high and they got to get them down 
[02:26:00]  they got to get them down after they get the building built and there's no crane from the street  that can go that high to get the crane and you can't get another crane to lower the crane down because  then you got a crane up there they have to have like some sort of jacks that they put and then they  keep putting levels and they raise it up and they do the same thing to get it down like they lift it and  they pull the pieces out and then it comes down comes down where through the middle of the building  because they're on top of the building yeah usually it's like the building's completely like the one 
[02:26:30]  we're watching it's in the the support for the crane is through the middle of the building yeah  this crane would have to come down on the outside of the building and we've never have you ever seen  one of these cranes coming down no we're going up for that matter they just magically appear don't  know how you doing mike what's going on hey guys hey yeah i used to work down in the sewer systems  not like hit them but you know we used to do uh manhole inspections on them and there's like 
[02:27:00]  before you can enter them you have to like check off all these things like there's a flammability  thing like an explosive thing uh hydrogen sulfide like a lot of nasty stuff down there so mike you  inspect manholes for a living i used to i got out of that crappy business yeah all right  uh thank you mike no problem okay uh from the ona message board guys my dad works at con ed he's  told me some stories about a manhole about manhole coverage going flying he told me sometimes they 
[02:27:30]  find them on top of 15 story buildings cut right through cars from when they fall uh they are caused  by gases building in the sewers and the transistors and the manholes click over and spark then boom it's  effing crazy you know we were talking about um uh the ethnic things and it seems to uh happen to  one ethnic group i swear to god the hispanic cannot keep their babies in the friggin windows  every time a baby falls out of a window and you hear about it i'm not talking about women that throw 
[02:28:00]  the babies to the dogs like that one that happened the other day but anytime you hear a baby that fell  through a window because it didn't have the bars on it always hispanic just bringing it up just an  observation opie who's uh too afraid to even comment on that you're doing observational humor today i  noticed hey what's with these hispanic children falling out the window bill what's going on what's  up guys uh dollar bill actually that's how you usually call me but um the crane the crane is actually built 
[02:28:30]  uh put together in a shaft and lift it up into the building as they go up and they dismantle it on  itself it actually comes down on itself through the same shaft that went up all right what they're  doing is they as they need to go up the floor they just add the uh the beams to the side of it and  then they raise it floor by floor so then when they take it down they jack it up kind of remove another  piece from the structure that holds it lower it down onto the other piece  jack they actually stand on top of it and they stand on top of it there's a platform on top of 
[02:29:00]  those cars uh you see them on the side of the buildings on manhattan with the ones on the inside  they stand on top of it and then they lower it floor by floor take the supports from the top from  above it down and then they just keep going up and down riding up and down in the elevator until it's all  gone but it's a crane </pre>
