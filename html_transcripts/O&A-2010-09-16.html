<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the fallout from a listener’s tweet suggesting that Ron’s colleague, Fez, might have MRSA. This led to extensive deep-cleaning of the studio, including hazmat crews, and Fez being required to get a doctor’s note before returning to work, causing tension between the two shows.  The bulk of the show, however, focused on a new intern, Stevie, whose unusual appearance and mannerisms, including his nystagmus (a condition affecting eye movement), became the target of numerous crude jokes.  The hosts relentlessly teased Stevie about his appearance, perceived lack of social skills, virginity, and his fondness for Big Country.  Stevie, however, gamely participated, reading his own comedically-offensive soft drink advertisement, "Schlong Soft Drink," and sharing his top 20 worst insults ever received ("faggot" being number 20). His severely damaged glasses were also a frequent source of mockery.


The show then transitioned into a humorous, though offensive, interrogation of Stevie about the nicknames he'd received throughout school ("pussy," "red beard," "douche," "Tiny Hands McGillicuddy," "shots of Visine," etc.). The conversation delved into Stevie's strained relationship with his father, described as a "bad guy" and a "not very good parent."  Despite initial discomfort, Stevie warmed up, showcasing surprisingly good comedic timing in his "Schlong Soft Drink" bit.  The hosts then launched into a lengthy discussion about the winner of *America's Got Talent*, interspersed with tangents, including a scathing review of the *Death Wish* film series. Rich Voss and Bob Kelly were mentioned as upcoming guests.


Opie then recounted a story about performing oral sex on an older man for a steak as a teenager, a story extensively discussed and joked about by the hosts and in-studio guest Rich Voss.  The conversation drifted to a debate about the proper term for a large outdoor gathering (picnic vs. barbecue vs. cookout), Rich Voss's boogie-boarding injuries (including a possible broken nose and near-paralysis), and whether Voss had been invited to Nick DiPaolo’s party.  Robert Kelly (Bobby Kelly) also joined them in studio.  Sherry, a NASCAR employee, briefly appeared, discussing her work and the presence of several NASCAR drivers in the building.  The show concluded with discussions about a comedian’s upcoming gigs, including one at a comedy club in an Italian restaurant. The overall tone remained highly vulgar, sexually explicit, and humorous.


A significant portion of the show detailed Anthony's home robbery during a party.  He described a guest being caught on camera entering his gun closet and later discovered to have stolen over a thousand dollars.  A police officer present at the party questioned the thief, but he left before Anthony could confront him.  The conversation veered into the political primaries, the hosts’ differing opinions on the seriousness of the robbery, and tangents about karaoke, ham radios, and their personal lives.  The latter half of this segment reintroduced Blind Stevie (the intern), whose appearance and mannerisms again became the focus of vulgar and offensive jokes.  The discussion involved increasingly crude anecdotes about Stevie's life and his difficult relationship with his father, further escalating the offensive humor.


The final segment included a caller, Stevie, who recounted a violent altercation with his father, describing physical assaults in a movie theater and other instances of abuse.  Opie, Anthony, and Rich Voss (in-studio) reacted with a mix of shock, humor, and profanity, extending the vulgar jokes about Stevie’s father’s occupation and personality.  The conversation shifted to phone calls (which Stevie declined fearing his father), and then to plugs for various comedy shows.  The segment ended with more jokes, profanity, and the hosts teasing each other, punctuated by the repeated, nonsensical use of the phrase "pump tent."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shut up!  Get us back to the funny.  But first, let's play this.  People understand we don't belong on radio, right?  Satellite radio douchebags?  I take that as like a compliment.  Yes, we suck a dick.  Sorry to everybody out there.  This is fucking satellite fuck dick radio. 
[00:00:30]  Holy shit.  What a great show.  We heard you.  I don't want to make everyone feel bad,  but you know this is what old people sit around and do.  Bitty porn, semen squirting, and shoot up the job.  Oh, what the fuck?  This morning has been, I feel like I'm on Jerry Springer.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We're friends with him, but he's a terrible person. 
[00:01:00]  Of course he is.  Most of the people we're friends with are terrible people.  Yeah, horrid people.  Yep.  Morning.  Morning.  The place smells nice again, huh?  It smells disinfected.  Yeah, man, because the Fez thing continues.  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  It's probably going to turn out to be nothing, but...  But now what's the latest?  Well, the latest is...  On Mr. Fez Watley.  Well, the company did the right thing,  and they cleaned this place to make sure there's no MRSA or anything else  that's highly contagious.  Some type of infection.  That I could bring home to my son, by the way.  That's what this is about, because I'm getting beat up.  Like a little present?  I don't...  For the most part, I don't care.  I believe I'm healthy enough to not, you know,  to back down diseases. 
[00:02:00]  The dumb stuff anyway, right?  But I want to bring something home to my young son, so...  My young son.  The paranoia hit me, and when Ron and Fez were talking  that Fezzy might have a little MRSA,  it was either a joke or the real deal.  And then we dug deeper with Dr. Steve and everybody,  and he's like, yeah, there's a possibility it could be something.  Yeah.  So they cleaned the place, and then let Fezzy back yesterday. 
[00:02:30]  So I go, well, guess what, guys?  This is what I told management.  I go, well, go clean the place again.  So the hazmat suits were in here yesterday again.  They just left a few hours ago.  Everything, again, looks very clean.  If you look even closer, it looks even cleaner.  Cleaner, because it's got the twice over now it's had.  Because these guys didn't know what to really clean,  because they cleaned it the day before.  So they just clean everything.  Again.  Yeah.  And the latest, and now this is where the two shows  are going to have to start hating each other, unfortunately.  Oh, no, but it's been so long. 
[00:03:00]  We've got the longest-running shows that got along ever have been  the Ron and Fez show and the Opie and Anthony show.  No two radio shows have ever gotten along as long as we have.  Well, I think the streak might be over.  It's finally done?  Well, because I guess management took Fezzy aside.  Oh, no.  And said he can't come back until he has a doctor's note.  And this is, we're forcing Fezzy to get a doctor's note  so he can do his job.  And this is absolutely because of what you have said. 
[00:03:30]  Yes, of course.  All based on a tweet from a listener that probably is 300 miles away  from where we broadcast.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it's over between the shows, I think.  I think this could be the beginning to the end.  Could be it.  You can't make another broadcaster get a note from a doctor ever.  A doctor's note.  Especially because we're all grown adults.  Now, he was going after the show yesterday.  Right. 
[00:04:00]  So, does anyone have any information on what the doctor said?  Well, all I know is they decided to get the cleaning crew  back in here last night.  Uh-huh.  So Fezzy went to the doctor.  Oh, interesting point.  Wouldn't he have been able to just call one of the bosses down the hall?  Hey.  And say, hey, this is what it is.  It's not MRSA.  Yeah.  But I'm thinking if they got the cleaning crew back in last night.  That they heard something. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, scrub-a-dub-dub.  Oh, boy.  And then I got an email that Fezzy's not coming back until he gets a doctor's note.  So, I don't know.  Didn't he go to the doctor, though?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Yeah, so he wouldn't have the note?  That's just it.  If he went to the doctor, then they wouldn't have had to clean this place yesterday, is  what I'm thinking.  Right.  No, if he went to the doctor and everything was fine...  Why would they have to clean this place?  He could have called management and said, I went to the doctor, everything's okay. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  And the management went, oh, okay, we don't have to clean.  And then when we came in this morning and said, hey, what the fuck, they would have said,  well, Fez went to the doctor yesterday and it's diagnosed as this and it's not that serious.  So, now I'm leaning towards, oh, no.  I'm leaning towards...  Mercer.  Mercer, yeah.  I don't know.  You'll have to listen to Ronnie at 11 o'clock today.  Oh, shit.  Because now he's got to be mad at us because now he has to do a solo show.  Oh, that's right.  Ronnie's going to be mad because...  I mean, as great as Ronnie is, he does like to just at least bounce off that vacant stare 
[00:05:30]  of Fezzy's.  Oh, my God, that poor intern.  Yeah, the vacant stare.  You know.  So, he'd rather do that than, you know, communicate with a wall.  Yeah, yeah.  At least he can look at something.  Right.  Is he going to put a crash test dummy in the chair?  Maybe he'll do that.  Maybe he'll put up a picture or something.  Oh, boy.  Is that kid...  I don't know what he's doing. 
[00:06:00]  Who is that person?  It looks like the kid that had the horn blown in his face and woke up and started yelling  at his brother.  That he played yesterday?  Yeah.  Is he a little funny?  I don't know.  Is he slightly funny?  Is he the guy that looks at everything real close?  And not funny in a good way?  Sam, is that guy a little funny?  A little funny.  You know what I mean?  What do you mean?  Sam knows...  We have a new crop, by the way.  A new crop of interns.  A new crop of interns.  So, again, I don't know what their names are, what the fuck they do, what their stories 
[00:06:30]  are, but a new crop, and Sam is the guy that usually has the skinny on the interns.  Not only that, but I get to hire them now.  Yeah, that's true.  Yes!  Maybe we'll get some actual men now.  Well, no, we're going to get a lot of weirdos.  Usually Sam was allowed to pick the one weirdo of the crop, but now that Steve's not around,  it's going to be all weirdos. 
[00:07:00]  Look at Crispin Glover's walking down the hall.  I know.  Look at this guy.  All right, Hamilton.  That's great.  Jackson Brown.  Right.  Haven't you guys noticed the caliber of intern that we get has progressively been going  downward?  Right down the chair.  That's because Sam has been involved in the hiring process.  More control I get.  You know, that rules, though.  I've got to be honest.  It rules.  Well, listen, we lost...  Why do you want some do-gooder fucking...  Right.  We lost Love Buzz.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Love Buzz is gone?  Oh, yeah.  Tragic loss.  Tragic loss.  No, I'm bummed Oscar's gone.  Oscar.  Oh, George Harrison.  Very good, Danny.  A young George Harrison is now interning for us.  But we had to find a replacement.  Yeah?  That's where I found Stevie.  That's Stevie?  Is he funny?  He's very funny.  He's got a million of them.  No, it's...  He's got a million of them.  Oh, no.  You never want to hear that.  Is he officially, you know, a little bit?  This is only his third day, and so far I've actually...  He's got Down syndrome, right? 
[00:08:00]  No, he doesn't have Down syndrome.  That I know of.  I've partnered him with...  I know we've been opening our minds over the last couple of years, so this is where we're  going now?  No.  Open your mind.  Giving people that don't get opportunities an opportunity?  He's got...  No, he's got plenty of opportunity.  I've actually...  What percent funny do you think he is, Ted?  15 percent funny?  If you're looking for funny percentages, I think we've got to really go down.  Dude, I...  Single digits.  I could put his picture up on a Special Olympics website.  Oh, yeah.  People would be cheering for him. 
[00:08:30]  And they would absolutely think he's a bit funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  What's with his peepers?  He...  His vision is not the best.  Not the best.  I saw him...  I just looked out the window.  Now, this is why we're even having this conversation, and that looks exactly like him.  Danny just found a picture of a Down syndrome child.  It looks just like him.  I looked out the window and saw him tinkering with a little radio unit and a headset.  Yeah.  And he was holding it.  I kid you not. 
[00:09:00]  I'm not exaggerating.  It was one inch from his face trying to plug something in.  Yes.  Well, yesterday, he spent a long time...  That looks just like...  Yeah.  I told you.  Yesterday, he spent a long time trying to figure out what Troy's name was, because we wouldn't  tell him.  Yeah.  So, he went to Troy's desk, and he looked at his name tag on his desk, and said...  Well, it says right there, his name is Todd.  So, that's about where his vision is. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, look at this.  Oh, really?  He went to the East Islip school area, and that is where I, indeed, went to the same school.  Hey!  There you go.  I was in the East Islip school district.  Yeah, but you went to many different schools.  Yes, but that was the one where Boomer Sison and me got in a little...  But you didn't go to the special classes.  No.  No.  His date of birth is January 25th, 1991?  Yeah.  Ninety-one. 
[00:10:00]  Ninety-one.  Dude, dude.  Yeah, I know.  It's crazy.  It's nineteen.  I was already in radio ten years when he was born.  He's rocking...  I was a Dookie Houser, let's not forget.  He's rocking community college.  This could be the next Opie, you never know.  Yeah, really?  This is the future of broadcasting.  I never looked that funny.  What's wrong with him?  All right.  Hopes and dreams.  Uh-huh.  To make sweet love with a woman, dot, dot, dot, eventually.  You should get some history.  The reason we have a bio on him...  Yeah.  ...is because on their first day, D-Boy saw a bunch of the interns just standing around. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  And so he got frustrated with them and told them all to write up bios with pictures.  He's that guy, I'm telling you.  No, he's got a beard.  Will he be honest?  I bet you people think he's funny.  Should we talk to him?  Yeah, we will in a minute.  Okay.  Hobbies.  So he's a virgin.  Nineteen-year-old virgin.  You bet.  Wow.  I mean...  Yeah, and he wants to have a future in radio, talk, or rock format.  Mm-hmm.  Hobbies.  Playing and watching ice hockey.  Opie. 
[00:11:00]  Now, we know you have tickets, usually season tickets.  To the Islanders of the year.  Shut up.  Wouldn't it be nice if you took young 1991 born Steven to an Islander game?  Listen, on his resume, his email address, I won't say what it actually is.  It's got some numbers and stuff in it.  Yeah.  But it's Isles Rock.  Oh, dude.  He's a big fan of the Islanders.  Do you know how you'd look if you walked in like that?  People would applaud you.  Oh, you're being so good.  To make a wish.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  They would think I'm helping out the Special Olympics.  That's not bad for my image.  It would be pretty good.  That's good.  Give me a, give me a, yeah, all right.  The problem is how bad it is for the image of the Special Olympics.  Favorite team?  Islanders.  He loves playing video games, listening to music, and plays the drums.  Favorite fans?  Nirvana.  The Police.  Devo.  And Big Country.  He's a Nirvana fan, too.  You guys have a lot in common.  And I love the police, too, by the way.  I don't talk about the police much, but... 
[00:12:00]  So you can make each other mixtapes to listen to while you're driving up to the Islanders  game?  That's a great idea.  This guy has to be retarded, though.  What do you mean?  No one would list their favorite bands as Devo and Big Country.  Big Country.  Big Country had one song.  One hit called Big Country.  And Devo, questionably, maybe had two or three.  Oh, this is a hell of a song.  He's probably dancing to this.  All right.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Do words kick in right now?  Yeah?  Doesn't it? 
[00:12:30]  Like, oh.  I'm fighting for you  In a big country  With a big tongue in my mouth  I'm fighting for this bass  And I'm fighting for this  You're fighting for this  With a big fat tongue  And there we go 
[00:13:00]  It's not a  It's not a  Corbat  Corbat  Corbat  Corbett, Corbett, Corbett.  Holy shit.  Big country.  Name one other big country song.  Just trying to get into the radio business.  Learn about the radio business.  I did rock radio for many years, and I couldn't name another big country song.  He wants to do rock radio, too.  I know.  Rock radio.  Islander fans, that's great.  I was listening to a station over vacation.  Yeah.  We're talking about many different things.  They were called The Shark. 
[00:13:30]  Very dangerous station.  Yeah.  They were a very dangerous rock station down there in the Outer Banks.  The Shark.  92.5, The Shark.  If you could look up that radio station, because everything was very dangerous and revolved around...  Sharks?  Yeah, around sharks in general.  The Shark.  Oh, man.  That sounds dangerous.  Anyway, back in.  So, can you name another big country song, anyone?  And I mean the audience, not just in here.  Big country. 
[00:14:00]  No.  No, right?  Dude, I couldn't name that one.  All right.  Really?  You don't...  You've heard that song?  I have, yeah.  Okay, good.  Uh, uh, favorite quotations?  Let's see.  Uh, and then I quote.  I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert, but I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime.  In a big country, dreams stay with you.  Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside.  Stay alive.  His quote is big country.  His favorite is quote. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, we missed the obvious.  Let's go to Cody in Indiana.  Hey, uh, Cody, what's up, buddy?  I'm so afraid and I almost want to fucking punch out.  But, uh, I'm a big dummy!  Big dummy!  Ah, no, that's good, dude.  All right, that works, brother.  I'm a big dummy!  A little mean-spirited.  It is, just a tad.  Cody knows how to do a phone call.  Yeah, that's it.  He hung up.  He's gone.  Gone.  Uh, favorite movies.  Movies.  Wait, do you think that he listens to country? 
[00:15:00]  Do you think when he listens to big country, he's, like, with somebody and he, like, really  wants them to hear the words?  Yeah, I mean, if his favorite quote is from big country, you know he wants them to hear  the words.  I bet he said that before, and then when that part of the song comes on, he wants them  to go, hey, now I see.  Yeah, oh, see, big country.  Here, share some of my paint chips.  Here's an infant, let's throw it in the tub or out into the yard or something.  How do you look a little funny, but you're not a little funny? 
[00:15:30]  I'm really confused by this kid.  Oh, I can't wait.  Ah, I just, you know.  It's kind of luck.  Favorite movies.  Yeah.  Slapshot.  Major League.  Back to the Future.  Hey.  Blade Runner.  Clerks.  And Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey.  He preferred the sequel.  Yeah, he liked the sequel more than Big Adventure.  I'm going to spin this back on you.  You want me to take him to a hockey game, but I'm thinking you guys should do a little  Back to the Future viewing in the big theater at your house.  That would be great. 
[00:16:00]  First, I think he has to come in at some point.  Not now, but whenever.  And I want to see his Back to the Future knowledge.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Because if he doesn't actually have a good background and understanding in the movie,  I don't want him over.  That's it.  All right.  That's fair enough.  Yeah.  Celebrity encounters.  Wow.  He met Trotz.  Once met Brian Trottier and acted like a nervous preschooler.  What year is this?  1984?  Just happened.  What's wrong with this kid?  That's because he wet his pants.  I know.  A nervous preschooler? 
[00:16:30]  At this point, Brian Trottier is very excited when anyone recognizes him.  Jesus.  Favorite TV show.  Get a hold of yourself.  Unsolved Mysteries.  What?  South Park, Beavis and Butthead, early 80s MTV.  Because it was Big Country.  Big Country.  Because Big Country was one of the first videos.  Big Country.  They would play where they're on the all-terrain vehicles.  And they were on the mountainside.  On the mountainside.  Well, of course.  Stay alive. 
[00:17:00]  Software Literacy.  Okay, this gets into a little more of the business end of it.  Yeah.  What he does.  It's more like a resume kind of a thing.  Microsoft Office Suite.  Adobe Photoshop.  Apple Final Cut Pro.  And Audacity.  So he does have...  Very well versed.  Very well versed.  Yeah.  These other pages, he was told...  I gave him to Troy and told them that they would be creative partners.  Uh-huh.  And Troy...  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  And then Troy told him that starting yesterday, he's got to come up with a new idea for a bit 
[00:17:30]  every single day of his internship.  Because we want to get these creative juices really flowing.  And he was...  Let me tell you something.  Well...  He was pumping them out.  We have idea number one right here.  He's going to have to actually do one of these ideas.  Oh, of course he is.  I think he should do all of them.  All of them.  Uncomfortable News Minute is the name of Stephen's first idea.  And it's described as this.  I'll do reads on the most, and he used the word, wacky... 
[00:18:00]  That's good.  ...and uncomfortable news stories I can find, and have it be around one minute or so.  That's where the minute part...  Hence the minute part of Uncomfortable News Minute.  And then the Uncomfortable News is what he's reading for a minute.  What he's reading for a minute.  Right.  So it really does spell it out.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  Stephen's number two idea here.  Titled, People Are Dumb.  Does he just look in the mirror for a minute?  Oh, that's unkind.  Oh, it's anyone on the track he's running with at the time for a ribbon. 
[00:18:30]  He says, I go to the street and get idiotic feedback on...  Current News Topics.  It's very news-oriented.  He likes this.  Hence the dump.  It's never been done before.  No, no.  People have never gone out.  That's just called the news when they go out on the street.  This, uh...  This looks like a little bit already.  That's right.  This is like a little skit, a little commercial.  A little skit. 
[00:19:00]  A little sketch.  Oh, no.  That he did.  So I don't know if you want to spoil all his punchlines, or...  No, I'm going for this one right now.  Okay, okay.  This is called...  It's a little bit, Opie.  That we probably might have played something like this early in our career.  We probably would have.  We probably wrote about ten of these.  I know!  This is called Schlong Soft Drink.  Schlong Soft Drink.  Oh, boy.  Schlong Soft Drink.  Oh, boy.  And here's the...  That's like Dick Insiders.  Yeah.  Yeah, sort of.  Yeah, it's like Dick Insider. 
[00:19:30]  Dick Insider, right?  Or, uh, Klee Motors.  Klee Motors.  And Klee Taurus.  Right.  No, he is a huge fan of the show.  Yes.  So I'm sure that he heard when we tore apart the intern last summer for the Dick Insider  bit that he did.  Ah, that he wrote.  So he stole from...  Fifteen years after the original.  Right, from 20 other radio guys.  So Stevie decided to come up with something a bit more original than that nonsense.  Yeah, this is a Schlong Soft Drink.  And here's the read.  Thirsty?  Grab a Schlong! 
[00:20:00]  Straight out of Russia.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yes?  Star right.  Star right.  Star right.  Star right out of Russia.  I was correcting.  Star right.  Star right out of Russia.  Star right out of Russia.  It's Schlong!  The brand new soft drink that gives a full taste and will leave with a feeling, not leave  you, will leave with a feeling of long, hard satisfaction.  Get it?  Are you getting this?  Oh, it's kind of like a sexual thing. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, good, good.  Schlong is available in all sizes, including small, medium, large, and donkey.  This kid loves cack.  He loves it.  Also available is Asian Schlong for those craving that taste.  Schlong without getting filled up.  If you really want a drink that will melt in your mouth, always grab a Schlong.  Schlong.  All drinks melt in your mouth.  They're liquid already.  Holy shit.  Let me just... 
[00:21:00]  Hold on.  I can't...  I got to get over that.  I just read it, but I...  It's funny, right?  Dude, I have to hear him read this.  Yeah.  I have to hear him.  Has anyone ever heard him talk?  I mean, I've...  Yeah, I've had lots of conversations with him.  Yeah.  Well, this leads to what I saw yesterday, Ed.  Uh-huh.  The kid was an inch away from a piece of paper writing.  Writing.  It's like Governor Patterson.  So I go to Kenny and I think...  And Sam, I go, what is he doing?  And I think...  Was it you that came up with the idea?  The 20 names he's been called? 
[00:21:30]  I believe, actually, Troy told him...  Because he was...  I sent him in to learn how to phone screen from Troy.  That's kind of the thing, you know.  I send him places to people.  Not to bother them, but so he learns.  Hello.  Where can I get this delicious beverage?  It sounds wonderful.  You're not forgotten, Steve.  No.  You're not forgotten.  You will live on for at least another week and a half. 
[00:22:00]  But so Troy sent him away and told him to come up with the list of the 20 worst names he's been called in his life.  Ah, that's interesting.  That tells a lot about a person, I think.  Did he make that list?  Yes, he did.  All right.  You want to meet this kid?  How many were retard?  I would love to meet Steven.  Stevie.  We'll call him Stevie.  Stevie.  And he's wearing an Islanders shirt.  Dude, that's even worse.  Stevie.  He calls...  Of course he's wearing an Islanders t-shirt. 
[00:22:30]  And he better be way more nervous to meet us than stupid Brian Trottier.  What does Brian Trottier have done in the last 20 years?  Here he comes.  Yeah, his entry music.  Listen to your entry.  You have entrance music, dude.  How happy are you about this?  That's good.  Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.  What's another big country song, by the way? 
[00:23:00]  All right.  First rule of broadcasting, speak into the microphone.  That's okay.  You're new at this.  Are you nervous to meet us?  Yes, very.  You should be, because we're much bigger stars than Brian Trottier.  Actually, with those glasses, he thought you were Brian Trottier.  No, I knew who you were.  So he's nervous as a preschool child.  And he had to answer that, like you were being serious.  I know.  He goes, no, I know who you are.  No, I know who you are.  No.  Name us another big country song.  They had a song called King of Emotion. 
[00:23:30]  Was that like their next hit?  What was their next hit?  No, that was a couple albums later.  The next album after that was...  No, no, slow down.  We all know the big hit from Big Country.  What was their second biggest song for the masses?  Well, I mean, they only had that one hit in America, but they were bigger in Europe than America.  Oh.  So that's probably why you only know them.  Like Rula Lenska.  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know who that is.  Why would you be a Big Country?  Very, very old reference I just made.  That's a good one, though.  But he loves the 80s culture, so he probably got it. 
[00:24:00]  Who knows?  Yes, he does like it.  Actually, I think that's maybe 70s.  Was it 70s?  I have no idea.  Rula Lenska?  Yeah, that's not a topical one.  Not even close.  Rula Lenska.  It's awful.  That would have been a really hot joke when I was 14.  So, how do you become a Big Country fan?  There's a million bands out there.  I mean, you know, I like a lot of music.  I like a lot of bands.  I mean, those are the only ones that I put down, but I mean, I listen to a lot of music,  and, you know, that song came up, and I got into them just from listening to In A Big 
[00:24:30]  Country.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, it's like one of those things where you hear a song you like, and you want  to get the whole album, and you sign on other albums that you want, you know, because I'm  a big music guy, you know?  Yeah.  I like how he does say it like, big country.  Right.  Like they do in the song.  I gotcha.  Because they have to.  Could you sing a little of the big country song for us?  Well, I don't have a very good singing voice, but I'll...  That's not true.  You're a musician, though, right?  In drums?  Yeah, I play drums.  Yeah?  How long have you been drumming?  Since I was in first grade.  Oh, okay.  So, you must be pretty good.  You're probably pretty good.  I guess.  I don't know.  I guess.  Uh-oh. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, that sounds like a hustler right there.  Yeah, I don't know.  And then you bring a kid in, and he's fucking just racking it.  Are you a little funny?  You got me.  What do you mean?  Like, retarded?  No?  Oh, shit.  You hear that a lot, though, right?  Face.  He nailed you.  Oh, my God.  He does hear it a lot.  Well, that's got to suck.  What do you say to those people?  It's all right.  My God.  All right.  He's going to sing a little big country for us. 
[00:25:30]  With no music.  Is that all right?  That's rough.  I know most of the song.  Oh, wow.  All right, go ahead.  Close your eyes.  You want the lights down?  No, no.  It's cool.  It's cool.  What do you mean?  Stevie Wonder?  I don't know.  What's that supposed to mean?  Stevie Wonder?  Well, because we were talking, you know.  Because he doesn't see anything, so with the lights down, I wouldn't be able to see anything  either.  What happened to him?  What? 
[00:26:00]  What happened to Stevie Wonder?  We're confused.  There's MRSA in my nose.  He can't see well.  God damn it.  I mean, he's blind.  I can't see so good.  What's up with your peepers?  My glasses?  My glasses.  Yeah.  I'm actually due for a new pair.  These I've had for a long time.  Like, I've noticed when you read things, you look very close at the page.  Yeah.  Yeah?  What's that about?  Is that needing new glasses?  Um, no, I mean, no, it's the way my vision is. 
[00:26:30]  Macular degeneration or something?  No, no.  Are you going to go blind before your internship's over?  Oh, shit.  That's horrible.  That's horrible.  It would be funny to watch happening, though, on some level.  Also, he just starts bumping into things.  Were you one of those kids that were, like, six months old with the glasses on?  No, I actually didn't start wearing glasses until I was in about third grade.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, really?  Horrible parents.  No, no. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  What, uh, so what's the diagnosis on your peepers?  Um, I gotta get a new pair.  But do you always look that close, even with a new pair of glasses?  Yeah.  Now, why is that?  Because people usually don't look that close.  Well, I have, uh, can, actually, I didn't tell Sam or anyone because I wanted to do my interview.  All right.  Hold on, folks.  Hold on, folks.  No, no, no.  It's, I...  Whoa, whoa.  He's yelling at me.  He's yelling at me.  Yeah, hold on.  The boss is talking.  He's got a temper on him, this kid.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[00:27:30]  Um, what do you got?  I have a, it's called nystagmus, and, uh, I've had it...  Oh, shit.  You need a doctor's note before you can come in here.  Just hang out with Fezzy.  It's cool, I mean, I can...  You have a lump under your armpit?  No, I'm fine.  I can see fine.  I mean, it's just...  What does that mean, though?  It's a condition I've had since birth where I really can't control, like, the movement  of my eyes, and I just...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What do you mean the movement of the eyes?  They just start wandering?  They want, yeah.  They go back and forth.  They go right down a girl's tits when they walk down the hallway.  No, they go back and forth and, like, uncontrollably, and I really can't completely control. 
[00:28:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Like Alan Suze?  Like fucking...  Another reference.  There it is.  Like Tweaky from Buck Rogers.  Can you say it?  B-D-B-D-B-D?  Who sang The Wanderer?  The Wanderer.  Oh.  The Wanderer.  That should be your favorite band.  This joke would have been great if I...  Dion?  Dion.  Del Shannon?  No.  No, he sang Runaway and then killed himself.  Oh, sorry.  He killed himself?  Del Shannon?  Yes.  Fuck you, Kevin from Connecticut. 
[00:28:30]  As he should have.  All right.  So your eyes kind of go crazy.  Yeah.  All right.  That probably wouldn't have blown his interview.  But I don't think that...  No, no, no.  You would have been an executive intern if I told Sam that ahead of time.  But that doesn't do anything to have to make you look at the page that close.  Well, I mean, my eyesight isn't that good either because of...  Even with glass.  It contributes...  That contributes to my eyesight being also a little worse than most.  But, you know.  How about your far...  Your far sight? 
[00:29:00]  Is that good?  Um...  I mean, no.  It's not...  It's not great.  How many fingers?  Are we just blobs to you?  Four.  Three.  Oh, shit.  Right.  He rocked.  Dude, he totally got it wrong.  Well, I'm not going with numbers.  He first said four.  Yeah, I was...  I was holding up three fingers.  Dude, I'm eight feet away from him.  How many fingers?  Two.  Okay.  Okay.  Fuck.  How many...  How many fingers?  Uh, one.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  Two.  He's blind as a rock.  I was just doing the rock symbol. 
[00:29:30]  I also got the mic stand going, so I can...  No.  Yeah, yeah.  It's at chin level.  No, you're Jimmy's.  Okay.  Oh, Jimmy, you fucked him up.  I'm sorry.  What shape do I look like to you?  We're just blobs.  Like, oh, you're...  I can see you.  I'm just not, you know.  Yeah.  It's a little fuzzy.  That's all right.  I can see all of you, though.  Can you make out facial features and shit?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Now, this virginity thing.  Oh, no, no.  He's got to sing big country stuff. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, that's right.  Shit.  Yeah.  Please, if you will, Stevie.  Okay.  The new intern.  Stevie.  Stevie.  All right.  Young Stevie.  I've never seen you look like this without a reason.  Another season got fallen through.  Another season passes by you.  Oh, wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah.  It will help you out.  I'm expecting to grow flowers in the desert, but I can't live and see the sun in winter 
[00:30:30]  time.  In a big country dream, stay with you.  Like a lover's voice by the mountainside.  Can you see a mountainside?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why he likes big country.  It's the only thing you can see is a mountainside.  He needs a big country or he bumps into things.  Right.  That's what I want to grow in my yard.  A big country. 
[00:31:00]  You're a virgin.  Who wouldn't want one of those?  I'm not taking him to an Islander game.  It would be a waste of a seat.  Why not?  What do you mean?  Tell him you take him to an Islander game.  You can't see the ice.  You wouldn't see the game.  No, are you like four rows off the ice?  I can see that four rows.  You know where you sit.  You fucking weirdo.  No, because I'm...  But are you stalking me?  No, I've seen the videos you put on YouTube.  Uh-oh.  He could get a puck in the head and restore his sight.  It could be a miracle.  A miracle on ice.  I could also die, but okay.  Yeah, true.  Now, there you go, man. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  Now, uh...  Oh, the virgin thing.  Virgin.  So, how old a guy?  Let me see.  You're 19 years of age.  Yes.  Did you grow up in East Islip?  Yes.  Oh, East Islip.  So, uh...  Did you go to Timber Point Elementary School?  Yes, I did.  I, indeed, went to Timber Point Elementary School myself.  Did they talk about Anthony at the old school?  No.  I don't hear much of him.  Christ Jesus.  Really?  I thought you could at least say, yeah, I heard something.  You got your picture on the wall in the hallway.  You know, Boomer Esiason also went to Timber Point Elementary School. 
[00:32:00]  You know, his picture is all over the high school.  Son of a bitch!  Fucking Boomer is all over.  Ouch.  And no Anthony, right?  Well, don't feel bad, because Tony Graffanino went there, too, and he has a World Series ring,  and Boomer doesn't have any championship ring, so...  Oh, wow.  There you go.  Thanks for that fact.  They all know a little bit about sports.  They all know a little something about sports, don't they?  Remember the male guy, the male...  They all seem to know a little bit about sports. 
[00:32:30]  If I take you to lunch, you're not going to stare at girls' tits uncomfortably while I'm trying to eat my lunch.  Oh, jeez.  Is that what Eddie did?  You don't remember that?  Yeah, like a blithering idiot.  I took him to the Brooklyn Diner, because I do have a heart.  I just don't like showing it.  And I brought Eddie to lunch, and we're sitting in a booth.  He was so excited that someone actually asked him for lunch after 30 years with a company.  And this girl came over that had just a nice set, and he was basically drooling as he's staring at this girl's tits. 
[00:33:00]  He doesn't have the switch.  It was so fucking uncomfortable, because he doesn't look funny.  He is funny, but he doesn't look funny.  Does this mean Stevie's going to get a lunch?  Maybe.  Lunch, island, a game...  Does this mean I look funny?  You do look retarded, let's be honest with you.  I mean, come on.  I can't control the way I look.  Do you...  I'm not going to, you know...  Obviously, I don't want to give you a dress out or anything, but do you live near Country Village Lane?  Um, yes.  Until recently, I was where my dad lives.  My parents separated and lived with my mom there.  Why are they separated? 
[00:33:30]  They separated when I lived there.  They blame each other?  Oh, God.  It was his bad sperm or her drinking?  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  Horrid.  Horrid.  I'm so glad we have a funny intern.  I lived there.  I lived there on Country Village Lane.  Right down the road there was Boomer.  And then some of my old bandmates lived there, too. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  You know the Klotz family?  No.  Eh, well.  Yeah, I'm a little bloody.  Klotz.  Oh, what are you going to do?  So, all right.  We're from kind of the same...  One of the same places.  Yeah.  Like that.  That's kind of...  And I'm a legend there, apparently.  A picture is just up all over the place with Boomer.  Now, the virginity thing.  Yeah.  What seems to be the issue?  Is it you not wanting to?  You not being able to? 
[00:34:30]  Is it women who have good eyesight?  No.  It's just I haven't wanted to, you know?  You haven't wanted to?  Get the fuck out of here.  Every guy wants to.  He's never seen Tiz.  Every guy wants to.  He thinks they're tumors.  No, I mean, like, I get horny and stuff.  I'm like every other guy, but, you know, it just never came up.  It never happened there in high school, you know?  How often do you tug your wiener?  You want to be honest?  Yeah, we tug your wiener.  No, maybe I'm a funny number with commas in it.  Of course. 
[00:35:00]  Two or three times a week.  That's about right.  It's not about right at his age.  I haven't had much time lately because I've been coming in here, so...  You've never been coming in here?  Don't do that.  Dude, come on, man.  No, no.  It's not actually coming.  You're a grown-up.  That's not very professional.  I'm a grown-up.  He's been coming in here, though.  You're 44 years old.  You said coming in here, though.  That was funny.  I assumed.  You've been coming in here. 
[00:35:30]  So, you...  But you don't want to?  No, it's not that I don't want to.  It just never came up in the past.  Well, you've got to kind of make it come up in the past.  No, I had opportunities.  What do you mean you've had opportunities?  I mean, I had girls that I could have went out with, and I...  Give me an example.  Well, I had a girl that I had a crush on, and she was kind of into me, but I was too stupid  to realize it, of course.  Oh, I didn't see the stupid things.  You were too stupid to realize it.  No, it wasn't like I was a card.  Was it a dance?  No.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe it was a dance.  I knew her from school.  I knew her from school.  Was it a camp? 
[00:36:00]  No.  Was she blind?  No.  I'm taking her stuff.  Most people, like...  Was she pretty?  Aw.  Yeah, I mean...  Yeah.  I got along pretty good with all the kids in my school.  I mean, most people don't really know that I have anything wrong with me, but you guys  figured it out pretty fast.  I mean...  Really?  When you put your face to a page like that, I would think people might go, I wonder why  he's doing that.  Well, I mean, yeah.  Well, he asked me about it.  It's a good conversation starter.  I just, you know, explained it to him straight up.  Have you ever looked back up and noticed they were gone?  You were still talking? 
[00:36:30]  No.  How do your eyes go all haywire?  Make it happen.  I can't.  Watch it.  I can't.  I can't control them.  Could you take your glasses off for a second?  Yeah, take them fuckers off for a minute.  Whoa.  Watch him while he's talking.  They go crazy.  Oh, my...  Yeah?  Could they be any closer together?  Holy shit.  Sorry.  No, I'm not.  Don't be apologizing.  That's good.  You're a predator.  That's good.  No.  Eyes close together, predator, far apart is prey.  Do your eyes actually look at each other?  No.  I'm kidding.  It's worse when I have my glasses off.  When I have my glasses on, it's not that bad.  Well, it's fine.  Just let them go nutty. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Let your eyes air out for a while.  You won't bother them.  Can you see anything now?  You're a lot worse now.  Wow.  What do you mean?  We would assume that.  Looking or just in general?  No, I mean, I can see you all, but it's a lot.  It's fuzzy.  How many fingers?  Two.  Okay.  That was a good guess.  He had a 20% chance of getting it right.  Yeah, that's true.  That scared me.  It seems like his eyesight's better without his glasses.  No, that was a lucky guess.  Okay, how about this?  How many fingers?  Is that all 10? 
[00:37:30]  Oh, shit.  Not even close.  You're off by 40%.  Wow.  It's all 10 for the woman that got her hand eaten by the monkey.  Seven?  You know, she doesn't have all her fingers, Jimmy.  Keep him up.  He guessed wrong twice so far.  Well, Jim said you're off by 40%, and then he did the math, and he came out with seven.  Oh.  Your third and final guess.  Math was never my best guess.  How many fingers is Ant holding up?  40%. 
[00:38:00]  Less than 10.  Six.  All right.  That's correct.  He's correct.  He did the math.  He did the math.  Not bad.  Wow.  A couple guesses, but he got it.  You're busted.  You're like broken.  No.  Yeah, he doesn't work right.  We have a broken intern.  So now, you don't date?  You don't pursue girls?  You don't...  Are you on Facebook and shit like that?  Yeah.  So do you know girls?  I know playing girls, yeah.  All right.  So what's the deal? 
[00:38:30]  No, he's on I Can't Look.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  That's how he reads.  His face is in the book.  There you go.  Oh, Stevie.  Stevie.  Stevie.  Stevie.  God, I hope this qualifies for a make-a-wish if I do bring him to a game.  So what happens when with these friends that, you know, do you try to get him to be a little  more than friends, or what happens?  Well, you know, I've flirted with a couple girls, and, you know, I just, it's kind of 
[00:39:00]  like where I don't see the opportunity right away.  I'm kind of...  You don't see anything.  Oh, stop.  Oh, damn.  When opportunity knocks, he answers the iron.  Figured to reestablish that already, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, Stevie, I'm depressed.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that's...  I'm sorry.  That's pretty sad.  Well, you're only 19, though.  Yeah.  When do you think...  If you have to have a ballpark number to throw out, when do you think you'll get laid? 
[00:39:30]  You never know, you know, something comes along.  No, you kind of do.  Oh.  You know.  I'd say anywhere from 20 to 27.  I don't know.  So you're writing off...  You're writing off the rest of your 19?  Well, I mean, my birthday's going to come up in January, so...  Oh, okay.  I like the fact he says, I got three more months of just jerking off angrily, and then it's  going to be tap-toeing through the fucking pussy garden.  Tap-toeing.  I'm sorry.  Tap-toe through the two lips. 
[00:40:00]  Through the two eyes.  Yes, of course.  What was the assignment we gave him?  You mean the 20 names thing?  That was...  You got that on you, Stevie?  Yes, I do.  He was told to always keep the list on him.  Of course he was.  So he could, you know, read it at all times.  Look at that paper.  Can I put my glasses on now?  That is worse than I've ever carried around shit in school, and I failed miserably.  You do realize...  It's a folded piece of paper.  Well, I've had this for two days now.  One day. 
[00:40:30]  You did it yesterday.  Discounts is two days.  Oh, hey.  Oh, talking back to Sam.  Hey, Sam, how about you shut the fuck up?  You're right, because 24 hours is two days.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  Matt isn't your strong suit.  I know.  Or seeing.  Put your glasses on so you can read the piece of paper.  They made me do like a...  Or seeing.  Oh, we're going to go right for the fucking throat, Sam.  Yeah.  It's a blind kid with red cheeks.  Stevie.  Stevie, can I see your glasses?  I want to see how... 
[00:41:00]  What?  No.  I'd like to see what kind of prescription they are.  Yeah, can I see your glasses?  A lot of times you look through someone's glasses and you're like, holy shit, I can't  see anything.  So Stevie's going over and handing Obi his glasses.  Wow.  Thanks, Steve.  The first person that handed Obi anything in ten years.  So you can be on the microphone.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Okay, well...  Is he really bad?  Why are they all busted?  Yeah, they're like bent and busted.  Yeah, well...  They have fingerprints in them.  Well, because I...  I played... 
[00:41:30]  With parents?  How many times have they just knocked off your face?  Look at these.  A couple times, actually.  I played deck hockey, so...  You need...  Dick hockey?  No, deck hockey.  Oh, dick hockey.  No wonder he has my girl.  You play dick hockey.  No, I don't...  I don't deck.  I play deck hockey.  Huh?  Oh.  You know, I don't...  Oh, sorry.  I don't, you know, do the docking thing with the two dicks.  No.  The one arm piece of these glasses is broken to the point where it almost doesn't fit on  his ear anymore.  There's no thing that goes around the ear. 
[00:42:00]  You need these to leave the house, and they're fucking busted.  No, they sit on my head still.  It's not a problem.  I'm going to get a new pair soon anyway, so I'll figure just...  Holy shit!  They're binoculars.  Holy fuck!  Holy shit.  Dude, if you put these...  Dude, I can't see anything!  If you put the glasses on, you'll get an instant...  You'll get an instant headache.  I'm fucking...  I got an instant headache.  I'm buzzing.  Yeah.  Wow, that's like a drug.  First of all, I want a photo of these horrible glasses. 
[00:42:30]  That is...  They're all busted apart.  Stevie, are you poor?  Do we have to buy you glasses?  No.  No, I just...  It hasn't...  You know, I'm overdue.  I'm going to go to the eyeglass place, you know?  Overdue?  Overdue.  You're way overdue.  Oh, the end is off.  That's what I'm saying.  What happened?  Look through those, Jimmy.  It's astounding.  You don't have conjunctivitis right there on your eyes, do you?  No!  Oh, all of our eyes are...  Is that thing contagious with your eyes going back and forth?  No!  Oh, fuck.  Get the hazmat people back in here.  Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right,  I don't have mercy, though.  No, I...  Oh, well.  Pink eye is very contagious, too. 
[00:43:00]  Look how bad that is.  Mars, make sure they clean the studio for tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  How are your eyes that bad?  Ugh!  Do you have lenses in your peepers?  Oh, yeah, I can see.  I mean, yeah, the eyes...  You can't see.  When was the last time you had your eyes checked?  Um, a couple months ago.  When are you going to go see Dr. Hubble again?  That doesn't make it.  Wow, you got bad eyes, dude.  Sorry.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Hey, Travis.  That's a shame.  They'll let Travis's glasses just beat up.  I'm really blind, so I want to see, like, how bad he really is.  All right.  Travis.  Wow.  Wow.  They pushed Travis backwards.  Is he worse than you?  Oh, wow, yeah.  And Travis, you're bad.  Yeah.  What is your vision?  20, like what?  20, well, without, it's like 20, 80, and with, it's like 20, 50, 20, 40.  20, 80.  It can't get you down to 20, 20, huh?  So that's like, what that means is, at 20 feet, what people could normally see, at 20 feet, 
[00:44:00]  to him, it looks like it's 80 feet away?  Yeah, without my glasses, yeah.  Wow.  Holy mother of God.  That's not that bad.  Yeah.  Do you drive?  No.  Thank God.  Oh, you don't drive?  Why?  I just, I just missed the, uh...  The eyesight thing?  The minimum for the...  Yeah.  But hopefully in the future, my eyes will get, you know, get better.  They're not going to get better.  During the driving test, you got me drunk.  I mean, I, I see, like, a special, I see specialist doctors and stuff, like, they, my eyes, yeah. 
[00:44:30]  What do they tell you?  What's the prognosis?  Well, you know...  We're over here.  So, uh, there's a chance that you might be able to drive...  In the future.  In the future, like, when there's flying cars.  No.  What, uh...  Wow, that's a bitch, dude, because that comes in handy with getting girls.  Well...  It's driving a car.  Yeah, but, you know...  Ah, you're right.  Have you ever driven?  At all?  And mommy's long gone, so she can't take you on dates. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Or take you to your dates.  Have drunken friends ever gone, hey, let's let Stevie drive?  No, but my friends have...  I've been in the car with my friends, and they go, hey, well, we should let Stevie drive.  No, we're all going to get killed.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's what I do.  Well, at least you have the magic of those interactions.  Yeah.  You got some magical friends.  They're wonderful.  Tell me about it.  Wow.  All right, could you...  My head still hurts from putting those glasses on.  It's terrible.  I got an instant headache. 
[00:45:30]  Wow, that really is.  Anything happen to you, Ann?  Yeah, it made my eyes cross a little bit.  I got like a migraine headache now on my left eye.  Thanks, Stevie.  What's another favorite song?  My eyes are useless.  I don't think it's a real song.  Nah, it's kind of...  Oh, boy.  Oh, literal Stevie.  Oh, literal Stevie.  Look at you.  I'm sorry.  Stevie, read your list.  So they made you...  What's the list?  What's the homework?  Okay, well, I was in Behind the Glass yesterday.  You sure? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.  And so I go in there, and Troy was in there, and Troy was...  How do you know?  Because I...  Well, they were trying to play name games with me, but I knew his name was Troy, but then  he confused me, and then I figured out it was, you know, Troy.  Ah, okay.  So, anyway, I was talking with him.  I was in there for a while, and he said something.  I went in, Sam told me to tell him something, and then he's like, oh, there's a weird, creepy,  weird kid in here.  Are you still with this story? 
[00:46:30]  No, I was starting to look at the phone.  Yeah, yeah, I was starting to look at, like...  Because this is the setup to the list.  To what?  Oh, wait, it's straightened everybody out.  Oh, right, Christy.  Hey, idiots, he's talking.  I'm sorry.  I thought the setup to a list would be a lot quicker, but that's okay.  No, there's a story behind it.  That's why I have the list.  Don't let me interrupt, then.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  So, when we last left you, Troy was in the room, and you were.  Yeah, and I'm like, I'm right here.  So, and they're like, it's all right.  You know, I've heard worse.  And he goes, really?  Really?  What else worse have you heard?  And I'm like, well, you know, I started giving him all the names and stuff. 
[00:47:00]  And he goes, here, do me a favor.  Write me a list of the top 20 worst insults you've ever heard.  It really is.  This all captures his idiocy.  I'm not trying to do an impression.  I'm just, you know, I'm just telling you what he said.  Fuck yourself.  Fuck your mother.  He ain't doing an impression.  Who's doing the impression?  You're the big shot.  No, you're right.  No, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm nervous of him.  He does these impressions.  You think it was Helen Keller?  I can see how a blind girl could fall for him. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, shit.  So, you've been called names over the years.  Well, yeah.  And you remember these.  They probably hurt.  Yeah, he told me to go through my memory bank, think long and hard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, what are, yeah, some of the names.  So, number 20, I chose faggot.  All right. 
[00:48:00]  You know, everybody's been called faggot.  Absolutely.  And you could just claim you didn't know.  Yeah.  You thought it was a vagina you were putting your face in.  Whatever.  It doesn't bother me that much.  No, I wouldn't.  It's all right.  19, uh, numb nuts.  Numb nuts.  Numb nuts.  You could call that.  Okay.  You think that's worse than faggot?  I'm, you know, I don't really care.  Okay, you're securing your sexuality.  Is this in order of, um, hurt?  Yeah.  Hurtfulness?  Number one, it's...  Well, I'm not saying what number one is.  No, it's number one is the worst one. 
[00:48:30]  Number one is the worst one that I feel is most of the same.  Okay.  All right.  So, like...  Son?  I thought...  Son.  That's because his parents hate him.  I know.  They spell it S-U-N just to pretend it's a yellow bright thing.  He has less damage looking into it than he's gotten from being born.  Oh, he didn't understand the rules with the eclipse. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, it's Steve.  Number 17, red beard.  Red beard?  Why?  Obviously.  Because you got a little bit of a red beard.  But I've heard people say, like, red beard, the pirate, like...  Ouch.  Two patches on his eyes.  And the pirate on his shoulder, poking at one.  Eating his eyeball.  This corny is delicious.  All right, Steve.  Number 16, pussy.  Pussy. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So pussy and then red beard bothered you in, like, that order?  You know, I mean, I...  I don't know.  It's just going through my memory bank, whatever.  Why would they call you pussy?  What would you do that they would, you know, because you usually got to do something before  someone goes, ah, you pussy.  It's not really my friends that call me a pussy.  It's more people who just see me around school that are kind of jerks and they're, you're a  pussy, man, or something like that.  Oh, that's real brave of them, huh?  I know, right?  Yeah, exactly.  And what do you do?  Did you ever confront one of them and realize an hour later you were talking to a locker?  No, it didn't bother me.  No, lockers are metal.  Sorry. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, man.  Jesus.  All right.  Okay.  Number 15 is douche.  Douche.  Yeah, that's a good one.  These are all hack names, by the way.  Yeah, well, you know, I don't come from a very original town.  They're all, no, man.  Sorry.  Stuff like that.  Maybe I was original when I was in East Islip.  Number 14 is one that Sam made up.  Yeah, you did. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, fuck you, Sam.  Fuck you and your family, Sam.  Tiny Hands McGillicuddy is calling you out.  His hands are a little small.  I'll add that to the list.  Old Tiny Hands McGillicuddy.  I was drinking to your mom, too.  Exactly.  I don't understand you sneak a little wine here, man, when you're pregnant.  You're not supposed to funnel booze into your vagina.  Jesus.  A little wine ain't going to hurt anyone.  Maybe a beer.  Jesus.  Goddamn.  Number 14 is shots of Visine while you were there. 
[00:51:00]  She drank her subblot.  Well, you know.  Holy shit.  Where's mom now?  Oh, she's at home sleeping.  Oh, yeah.  Do you live with mom?  Yeah.  So, dad ran?  No, I don't live with my dad.  Where's he?  He's still in East Isle.  Do you like him?  No.  Oh.  Is he a bad guy?  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  What did he do that was bad?  He was just not a very good parent.  Oh, God.  He's very bad to me.  I'm sorry.  He's bad to you?  Oh, shit. 
[00:51:30]  This is my weakness.  Would he yell at you?  Yeah.  Would he hit you?  Am I going to get in trouble for this?  Well, playing catch might have been a little awkward.  Let the kid be.  That ball hitting his head every time.  We'll get into another day.  Let him be.  Oh, come on.  You look sad, though.  I still want to know about this.  Oh, we just got it.  Oh, no.  You're okay, right?  Yeah, I'm good.  Yeah, you're fine.  Now, let him be.  Don't worry about it.  I'm playing along.  All right.  Good.  My dad did the same shit.  Exactly.  Look how he turned out.  Millionaire. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe we'll get into it.  Go ahead.  Hold it up with your little handsies.  Yeah.  We'll get into that another day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not today.  Not on his first day.  I'm more conscious about my hands now.  Don't be.  Don't worry.  You can't see them.  All right.  We're back on.  Make Voss up like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Go ahead.  Hold it up so I can fucking put my camera on macro and get a photo of those.  You're a pommeless ping pong ball.  Oh, man. 
[00:52:30]  Holy goodness of those tiny fucking hands.  Teeny.  I wonder you don't jerk off.  You can't.  You want me to go through the list?  No.  No.  We'll end right here.  Of course.  Well, number 13 is Dickhead.  Dickhead.  Yeah.  Like I said, not a very creative town I come from here.  Yeah.  I've heard that before.  Okay.  Number 12.

[01:39:30]  so what did  you think  yeah it was  pretty good  did you see  the part man  when like  he shot  the Giggler  and like  did you talk  about  I can't  fucking  fathom that  you know  at least  one person  after that  movie  probably tried  to incorporate  a laugh  and get  called  the Giggler  because he  thought it  was cool  what are you  doing  hey  it's the  Giggler  hey you know  what happened  to the Giggler  in the movie  though watch out  no but nobody  would call him  the Giggler  he would just  laugh a lot  and people  would just  go stop  laughing you  asshole  your laugh 
[01:40:00]  is annoying  movie stunk  they killed  the Giggler  but he repeated  it  yeah yeah  he had to  he was very  angry  killed the  Giggler  the Giggler  are you itching  or are you  mad at somebody  no I got  the heebie  that guy  didn't have  two bowling pins  killed the  Juggler  there probably  was another  gang member  called the  Juggler  every scene  by the way  in that movie  is that bad  it's just  it's like  that bad  so now we gotta  see this  dude we have  to see it 
[01:40:30]  I couldn't  stop watching  can I get it  on Netflix  of course you can  I don't know man  Netflix  I watched the  entire thing  and loved  watching it  yeah I gotta watch it  because I was so  douche chilled out  dude it should be  called Death Wish 3D  we should redo that  in 3D  it's wonderful  the Giggler  just like flying  toward you  as he gets  shot in the back  is the original  Death Wish still  holds up  nah  not as much  it's the same  but at least  it was violence  like real violence  the beating  with the jack  I kill rich cunts  that's the one  with that kill rich cunts  this number one  they're all so hokey 
[01:41:00]  wait let me ask you  was the Giggler  the same guy  that was in  Breakin  it looks like him  it looks like the  Puerto Rican guy  from the Breakin  from Breakin  might have been  I don't know  I don't know  there are a bunch  of fucking people  in these stupid  ass movies  Death Wish  it was such a  franchise too  when a new  Death Wish movie  came out  people were like  oh Bronson  yay he's back  Death Wish  Death Wish 4 
[01:41:30]  a lot of suits  around here today  what's going on  there's a giant  acquisition outbring  nice  they told you  they did actually  yeah  yeah I got an email  they're doing some  inside trading  no they just  wanted to know  what I thought  of it  they got Jimmy's  whole thing on it  I made some good  stock picks  nice  our intern  Louis C.K.  he's been here  for a year  I know  I just have to  keep goofing on him  there's something  going on with him  too  I have no idea 
[01:42:00]  who these people  are  there's something  going on with him  too  yeah  hopefully it's  an illness  you want to guess  he's a Peter  Pumper  shit dick  busy  he might have  is that guy  coming in here  to fire us  he's just walking  by  I hate suits  the suits just  get you all like  blech  when you see them  yeah 
[01:42:30]  by the way  the Giggler's real name  yep  it's a Hollywood name  if I've ever seen one  oh no  that's not his name  really  Kirk Taylor  I'm Kirk Taylor  who was he in  Full Metal Jacket  he was in Full Metal Jacket  was he  apparently so  maybe he was just like  he was Payback  which one was Payback  I know that name  I don't know  I just said he was Payback  it just sounded good  right Ant  yeah  alright we should take a break  because we got Bob Kelly  and Rich Voss standing by  we're going to do something  a little different  going into break  Jim Norton does a little 
[01:43:00]  side show for Sirius XM  on Raw Dog  it's on today actually  at 4 we're going live  Bobby co-hosted with me  usually  and today we have  Kurt Metzger  we were going to have  Judah Freelander  but he's shooting  so this is a preview  of today's show  yes even though  it's from last week  with Esther Kuh  I'm really confused  alright so this is  from last week's show  from last week's show  yeah  gotcha  ok so yeah  Jim Norton does this show  on Raw Dog  XM 150  Sirius 104  every Thursday  at 4pm  and he pretty much  co-hosts with Bob Kelly  and then you get  other comedians in there  and you guys just  fuck around 
[01:43:30]  and have a good time  and Bob Kelly  admitted something  pretty outrageous  last week  on Jim Norton's show  and with Bob Kelly  coming in  we figured we'd give you  a little piece of  Jim Norton's  little side project  side show  whatever  yeah  so check this out  as we go to break  and then we'll  ask Bob Kelly  about this  when he comes in here live  did any of that  make sense  yes  ok good  you got molested  no I didn't  I didn't either  but I think it's funny  when people do  you got molested  I didn't  I blew a guy 
[01:44:00]  for a steak  yeah let's move on  did you really  yeah  well here's what's  annoying  we had salmon  yesterday  I couldn't get  my dick sucked  no  as a t-bone  I'm not just  blowing guys for fish  who did you blow  for a steak  how old were you  how the fuck  I'm just curious  you were hungry  I think I was young  I forget  I was really young  16  Bob was about 15  no I wasn't  fucking in my teens  no youngsters  don't blow people  for steak  now who do you  blow for the steak  I was some guy  down the end of the block  this kid  who was like  you know  a little older than me 
[01:44:30]  it wasn't more  molestation  did he cook it for you  or did he take you  out to Albeck  to break flesh  we had one of those  little hibachis  and we went out  on the roof  after  was he Japanese  you were into Asian guys  no this guy  this guy had a big one  was he retarded  no he wasn't retarded  I was kidding about that  he was like scientific  like he invented shit  okay  I blew a fucking nerd  so basically  did you offer the blow job  like you want some steak  and you're like  alright I'll suck your cock for it  I didn't even know  what sucking cock was 
[01:45:00]  but what happened  he saw those soft lips  and he said  do you want some steak  my pillow lips  and then I just knew  we were in a closet  did he blow a load  in your mouth  no  I don't think he could  blow a load  did you lick his balls  no  we weren't fucking  professional faggots  did you get cum in your hair  you asshole  she asked a good question  did you get cum in your hair  no he didn't even blow a load  oh you were terrible  we were  I guess  I gave a lousy blow job  but did you kiss it first  yeah I'm subtle  what do you think I am 
[01:45:30]  let me ask you  dude I opened my mouth  I put it in  was it hard when you put it in your mouth  no it was soft  what was playing on the radio at the time  it was actually a journey  don't stop  yeah it was fucking  I don't think it was molestation though  because he was young too  it wasn't like a guy  it was like experimental  fucking gay shit  you know what I mean  how did it come about  what were the words  what did he say to you  I know you remember  how do you like this piece faggot  did he  no  no but how did it go  from steak to blow job  what did he say  quickly 
[01:46:00]  that's why I have weight issues now  that's really  hey do you have any  do you have any  I don't like the bottle  yeah how did it  how did it go to  fucking blow job  what did he say to you  I don't remember what he said  I just  you know you don't remember that shit  you remember pieces of it  I remember her closet  I remember her dick  that's why I don't like  I don't like  you know  locker rooms and shit  because it smells like cock 
[01:46:30]  did he make you lick his ass  no  we weren't fucking professional faggots  you're acting like  it's like the pornos you watch  no  did you brush your teeth  that's why  no not at all  I went right for the steak  oh my god  I had cock steak breath  that's worse than hot dog burps  Sirius XM  the virus  yeah  this is the Obedientity Show  twice as my boss  as it was the first time

[01:48:00]  oh god  I thought it was record time  for saying something silly  silly  you don't call a barbecue  we went to the picnic  no it's a barbecue  no it's a fucking Puerto Rican  Puerto Rican  what are we black  black people call it a cookout  no  huh  they call it a cookout  no it's not a picnic  oh oh right  right  it's different  just slightly different  oh yeah it's kind of like  the NBA draft  whose barbecue is this  Nick DiPaolo's  DiPaolo's  Nick DiPaolo's house  they call him picnic DiPaolo  once again I didn't get  invited to Nick's house 
[01:48:30]  ah that motherfucker  it's not that dude  it is that  he's had a million barbecues  and he's never asked you to come  why  I don't know  because you won't respond to his email  or answer his call  that's not true  this is what Nick does  Nick does this  he says  tells one person  and then he tells that one person  to tell everybody  and it's up to that person  yeah that's true  that's how Ant does it  I am despicable  did you have a party  on 4th of July  I mean on Labor Day weekend  yes I did  I don't remember getting my invitation  I wasn't invited  well

[01:54:00]  in a wave  okay  now this was before you  exited  and you came back  alright  so my vacation was a little rough  I had to flee a hurricane  not my choice though  huh  not my choice  what they made you  yeah mandatory  but then  not if you lived there  then I learned  you could hide your car  and stay there  which I should have done  because it was a  it was a bust  that hurricane was a bust  down there  yeah I know  but where do you hide a car  behind the house  they're not  they're not looking that  much for you 
[01:54:30]  did you leave  did you leave and go back  yes  so you had to  leave for how many days  and then go back  one day  60 miles inland  six hours in traffic  you had to sit in traffic  for like six hours  we were in a horrible  traffic jam  but then it turned out  it was a car accident  and then everything  kind of opened up  like Armageddon  fucking traffic jam  like  like get out of your car  and play frisbee  for a while  like Independence Day  traffic jam  better movie  get out of your move  thank you for  answering my joke  it was get out of your car  I said I'm not getting  I don't even know  if there was a traffic jam  in that  one of those  fucking asteroid movies  had a traffic jam

[02:59:30]  didn't  fucking  think of  the inside  attack  because I  wouldn't think  anybody  invited over  to my  house  that's being  cool  and shit  is going to  try to  I didn't  invite him  because the  circles you run  in are such  good circles  is that what  you're saying  well I do  perhaps Danny  knows some  people that are  a little  shady  have you  brought Danny  to task  on this  and brought him  in and asked  the goofing  and jokes  have not  stopped  anytime  anything  is missing  for a second  is Danny still  friends with  this guy  yes  that's the odd  part  yes  because he's 
[03:00:00]  got 500  extra bucks  yeah  the guy  was  he put it  in Danny's  bank account  fucking  chip  fucking  scumbag  fucking hate  you  so now  next time you  have a party  you're going to  say no one's  allowed upstairs  probably  yeah I'll just  say that  yeah that's  what thieves  do they  listen to  verbal  orders  I will  lock  the doors  upstairs  next time  you go there  he's going to  have a fucking  lasers  just laser beams  upstairs  yeah  more cameras

[03:01:00]  out the front  door  goes all the  way around  the side  of the house  into the  backyard  and sits  next to his  fucking dumpy  chick again  instead of  just walking  and he said  guess what I  found in a  barbie pocketbook  this was in  your easy  bake oven  nice if it  was 1968  I know  easy bake oven  I know  and he wasn't  using the  make oven  anymore  every joke's  a fucking  food joke  with this  guy  and every 
[03:01:30]  show is  a food  fucking  show  with you  wow  so you're  just going  to take  the hit  you can see  in your eyes  you're taking  the hit  I'll see  whatever  the cops  are doing  it's in  the law's  hands  now  if anything  if they  did arrest  him  and it  goes to  court  I'm sure  they'll have  to tell  him to  make  retribution 
[03:02:00]  for it  exactly  so I  tossed  the girl  out  I tossed  her the  money  that was  missing  you paid  her what  you owe  her again  did I just  sing the  Barney song  to her  or something  is that  no but  that's a  good one  do you want  us all to  chip in  and get  that thousand  back  somehow  no chip  shut up  wasn't calling 
[03:02:30]  you  that's fucked  up man  you can't  even have a  party now  it wasn't  even me  and I said  this before  it wasn't  even me  like  the guy  doesn't know  me  so he wants  to rip  me off  whatever  but to  fuck your  friend over  like that  you know  some friend  invites you  over to  somebody's  house  you don't  know  and shit  like that  and you  rob the  place  even said  to him  you're  among  friends  you go  over  a guy's  house  he probably  knows you  he knows  you got  some cash  and you  know  and he's  got nothing  he's 
[03:03:00]  fucking  hurt  and then  he walks  fucking  go see  what you  got  just to  snatch  some  shit  or he  could be  a drug  addict  well  that too  I don't  know the  guy's  background  what's that  I don't  fucking know  all I know  is he took  some shit  from my  fucking  house  but he  wasn't  stealing  from  Anthony  because Anthony  doesn't use  Anthony's  park  doesn't have  a pocketbook  so he  knew he  was stealing  from somebody  else  in Anthony's  house  so now  he's  victimizing  two people  Anthony  and the  person  and  three  people  so it's  probably  drugs 
[03:03:30]  involved  because when  you're  that  fucking  you know  shut up  no  it was  a fucking  little  long  was it  a pocketbook  or a  backpack  little  Winnie the  Pooh  backpack  little  Eeyore  backpack  he stole  fucking  a thousand  dollars  on my  trapper  keeper  that's  fucked up  so you  go buy  her books  the next  day  yes  really  what is  Jimmy taking  pictures of

[03:36:30]  yeah  there's a lot of us  have had father issues  we've talked about it  on the air  yes  I mean everybody  he had to take a fucking  shower with his father  and brother  he has to deal with  all the fathers  he's fucking  you know how many  disappointed father's eyes  I've looked into  I thought she was 
[03:37:00]  taking the school bus home  no I told you  I was giving her a ride  go ahead  Stevie  yeah  all right  what was it  mental  physical  did he hit you  a little bit of everything  what was the worst thing he did  yeah  what really stands out  he was kind of abusive  did he ever look at you  and just laugh  no  no it wasn't like that  no  I'll give you something real quick  we could do a little  sharing here 
[03:37:30]  one time  I stole a bunch of quarters  from my father's room  to buy ice cream sandwiches  because I was starving  because he never bought us food  he worked overtime  the week before  yeah exactly  please  I guess he didn't buy  another tall boy bud  to sit around  and do nothing with  and just drink  like you do  exactly  but I can afford to do it  you're saying it like  if I were kids  they wouldn't be starving  not if you had to pay  the thousand back  you're just fucking them  they'd be too sad to eat 
[03:38:00]  we make him sit here  we start attacking each other  get back to here  get back to him  it's just an attack  it's a free for all  it's like the army  after him  fighting  what did you think  you were going to do it  and get away with it  I don't  go ahead  so I  and then  my father thought  I had bought  some type of toy  with it  or a model rocket  with it  and actually  smacked me in the face  because I stole the water 
[03:38:30]  that's how they  said  you should have just done this  you could have had steak  instead of ice cream  I don't leave food around the house  for a reason  you faggot  because you're you  that's when I was starting  I said  alright let's go see  if Rich Vos and eat  I'll be working the sizzle up  in LA  so you guys  hopped out in the shower 
[03:39:00]  yeah  it was  but I felt so bad  because I took that money  because I was hungry  and he was supposed to  as a father  be supplying me with food  because I was a kid  and instead  he supplied me  with a smack in the face  and accused me  of using the money  to buy a toy  did you say  I was hungry  and he repeated  and the tree  smacked your hand  and started throwing  apples at you  that was really good  if you knew  what I was talking about  exactly  1939 joke  I'm sorry  that's what you were  talking about  that's when he wrote it 
[03:39:30]  he comes back  he came back  he came back  he came back  let's ask Stevie  what happened to you  oh shit  when you get here  it's nobody's saying  Jesus  all he said was  let's ask Stevie  how does that get you attacked  I haven't woken up  since my beating  two hours ago  I'm just coming too

[03:41:00]  with everyone  so I said no  it was a school night  I don't want to go home  he didn't like that  he wanted to see Harry Potter  so he could figure out  how to make you disappear  why?  it took too long  go ahead bro  don't let this go bro  yeah okay  so anyway  the theater was empty  so I got  so's your head  he's Harry Potter  hold on  Bobby wants to take a bite  I have one

[03:42:30]  he punched me  and kicked the shit  out of me  in the middle  of an empty movie theater  like really fighting you  yeah  like treating me  well not  yeah kind of  yeah  were you whining  and he gave you  one smack in the face  show us on Sam  go ahead  treat Sam like  he treated you  you're your dad  you get to be the dad  in Sam's you  do you want a condom  you're a little  Sam  you're a little Stevie  and you're the father  and you're a big bad dad  now do exactly  what dad did  alright Stevie  first let Stevie say 
[03:43:00]  do I have to really hit him  or can I like  yeah no really hit him  I hope he really does  have retouch strength  and he actually  takes Sam's head off  like a Quentin Tarantino movie  just flies across the room  the odds are good  he's going to miss  so don't worry about it  hit the one in the middle  hit the one in the middle  he actually looks at Vance  and it's actually  a normal face  oh cause it's thin  you have to take  three of them  to put them together  thanks  yeah  go ahead 
[03:43:30]  dad I really have to go home  I have to go to school  I don't think  this is a good idea  okay and then he was like  you don't have to say  he would just do it  yeah  just do it  keep going  just in your arm  no he would get me  but he see what he did  microphone  he hits a lot harder  than I do  what was he saying  as he was punching you  I wanted you to die  what was he saying  his teeth were grinted  I really don't know  what he was doing  he was like  guard her
