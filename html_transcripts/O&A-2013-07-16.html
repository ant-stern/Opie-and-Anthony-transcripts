<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie discussing the horror film "The Conjuring," noting Anthony's absence due to illness (shared with Lynn Coppola).  Jim Norton was in studio, recounting his terrifying viewing experience with two interns, Sidney and Jackie,  which included a confrontation with an annoyed movie critic. The conversation expanded to other horror films ("Paranormal Activity," "The Ring," "Cloverfield"), and memories of seeing movies with Patrice O'Neal.  Callers shared their own horror stories, and one criticized the show's focus on the interns.  The segment concluded with humorous anecdotes about drive-in theaters, including sneaking peeks at adult films.  The interns were actively involved throughout. Norton's lunch date with them was also discussed.  The entire segment was punctuated with vulgar language.

Opie then launched into bizarre childhood stories, including the time his family took in a rebellious teenage girl, "Karen," who smoked and eventually left.  He detailed other unusual family situations: a boyfriend living secretly in the attic, hosting inner-city children for the summer (a topic discussed with regard to its racial implications), and several problematic tenants, including a crack addict who used Opie's spoons and another who committed suicide by train.  Dennis Falcone's planned drive-in story was unmentioned.  Opie mentioned a highly viewed Ultimate Warrior interview and reacted to "The Conjuring" trailer on air. He also recounted the story of a Jehovah's Witness former colleague who refused to participate in a Mother's Day segment. The segment ended with a caller sharing a story about visiting Harry Chapin's grave.

The show then featured a studio interview with Jeff Bridges, preceded by Johnny D. recounting negative experiences with NAW colleagues, except for Scott Muni.  The interview covered Bridges' career, *R.I.P.D.*, his birthday, thoughts on remakes, *King Kong*, his band "The Abiders,"  meditation, technology, and anecdotes about his father, Marlon Brando (secondhand),  *The Amateurs*, and roles he supposedly rejected.  After the interview, Opie and Anthony discussed Bridges' filmography and a host's controversial, recently altered tattoo, with interns giving their opinions.

Comedian Joe DeRosa then joined the show to discuss his heavily criticized new tattoos, mocked by Opie, Anthony, and tattoo enthusiast Troy Kwan.  The tattoos included a poorly executed microphone, one initially resembling a KKK symbol (later altered), and an agnostic symbol. The discussion covered laser tattoo removal, the cost of quality tattoos, and DeRosa's encounters with George Carlin.  The conversation shifted to attractive actresses and Montreal show dates (in a conference room).  The segment included plugs for DeRosa's and other comedians' shows, an Insane Clown Posse appearance, and a brief interaction with a female reporter outside.

Claudia, a Los Angeles radio personality, visited the studio next.  Discussions included Claudia's career (including her time at Playboy Radio), her single status, flirtatious banter, Joe's "Kitty" tattoo (criticized for its appearance), plastic surgery, high heels, drive-in theaters, and further criticism of Joe's "KICK" (Keep Kicking Him in the Nuts) tattoo inspired by George Carlin.  The segment contained commercial breaks and live reads.  The show concluded with analysis and suggested improvements for the "Kitty" tattoo, ending with a Twitter post of it.

Finally, a segment focused on further criticism of Joe DeRosa's tattoo, with callers offering suggestions for fixing it.  Sam Roberts recounted a humorous interview with the Ultimate Warrior, including a story about his colleague, Roland, intruding on a photo opportunity. The hosts also shared a story about an awkward subway encounter with Mark Ruffalo, featuring Roland's clumsy interaction. The segment concluded with plugs for social media and the next show segment, all while continuing the jokes at DeRosa's expense.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio.  So shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house.  I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening.  It sounds like a little.  What?  He did a dang open hand.  It only did a dang open hand.  Stop it.  Stop with that shit.  And now, here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, god damn it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh boy. 
[00:01:00]  Good morning, everyone.  Good morning.  We got a sick radio show.  We got one down.  And I got a...  I got this type of cough, tickle thing.  See, it does that.  It makes me stop talking.  Anthony's out today. 
[00:01:30]  And I'm right behind him.  Who gets sick when it's 95 degrees out?  I know.  It's right from being in door.  Everybody has it.  Comedians, I know.  Everyone, right?  So many people.  Oh, it's scratchy throats.  I told you, Lynn Coppola's walked in.  She said, I'm losing my second voice.  I'm losing my voice.  What are they?  Just spray shit over the fucking city?  I don't know what it is.  We all just touch each other.  But how...  I don't know Lynn that well.  I've seen her once.  Why do we have the same fucking illness?  By me.  How weird is that?  Oh, you're the carrier.  I'm ground zero. 
[00:02:00]  You're ground zero.  For the monkey virus, I'm ground zero.  You brought it from the comedy cellar to the O.P. and Anthony show.  So, I'm going to be clearing my shit all morning long.  That's right.  You sound like me every day.  I'm always clearing my throat.  Well, that's a nervous habit, isn't it?  Some nervous tick or something?  No.  You'd think it was, but it's actually...  It's part of what I eat or what I drink.  It is literally...  Milk.  Milk.  We'll do it.  You know the haters hate how I say milk?  How are you supposed to say it?  I guess it's supposed to be milk. 
[00:02:30]  How do you say it?  Milk.  Oh, milk?  It's more of an E.  I think it's one of those Long Island words that I never got over.  I used to practice to get rid of my stupid Long Island accent, but I think...  Long Island accent.  Oh, God.  A few words still slip in there.  So, it drives them nuts for some reason because I say milk.  Oh.  I don't mind.  Thank you, Jim Norton.  You can say milk where you want.  Because you have a life.  That's why you don't mind.  That's why you don't mind, because you have a life.  No, I'm too busy clearing my throat. 
[00:03:00]  That really is a thing.  I think it's something I eat.  Maybe it's gluten or fucking weed or whatever.  Right.  But I'll eat certain things and my voice is just like...  I hate it.  You just want to clear it, right?  You just want to get everything out.  Yeah.  Like that.  Very satisfying to do that.  Well, we were just talking about it.  It was interesting.  Probably.  Oh, they hate how I say that, too.  What?  Because I don't pronounce the T in interesting.  Say it again.  I know how to pronounce all these words.  I just choose not to.  How are you saying it?  I say interesting, but I think that's more of a Long Island thing, too. 
[00:03:30]  I don't even notice, man.  Dude, it's interesting, not in it.  I didn't notice Ant said finger until someone pointed it out.  That's a good one.  Yeah, finger.  Now I can only hear finger.  And he struggles with that every time.  It's hilarious.  You see his brain, which is usually extremely quick.  His whole brain shuts down because he knows he has to say finger.  Are you going today to see...  The movie?  Yeah.  It was supposed to be a group project, so I think... 
[00:04:00]  Is anyone going?  I don't know.  The whole crew?  We're talking about that horror film.  What time is it?  What's it called?  The Conjuring.  The Conjuring, right.  Is it screening today?  Yeah.  Seven or something?  I don't know if you'll see me at seven.  Why?  Seven o'clock?  I'm at home.  So?  Are you supposed to participate in the discussion?  You're right.  You're right.  If there's a discussion, I'll be there.  All right, then you should go.  All right.  Who's going?  I'll go.  If you go, I'm not going.  That's obvious. 
[00:04:30]  Well, we just don't get along socially.  I mean...  Right.  If you can set up two screenings at seven, then we'll both go.  Please.  Please.  Yes.  Will Roland go?  Yeah, Roland has to go.  See, Kenny's the big get, but he's just not going to go.  You don't like horror films, huh, Kenny?  I think Kenny should have to go.  That's Kenny's...  Oh, go ahead.  I've never seen Kenny watch a horror movie.  That's Kenny's kryptonite.  This big, tough fucking monster doesn't like horror movies.  I just thought of something funny.  Yeah.  You know how you guys were talking about clearing your throat? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  You know how I clear my throat?  I know how I wish you did it.  I spit the cock out.  He's such a treat every morning, isn't he?  He really is a delight.  He's a delight for everyone.  He couldn't wait to say that.  Everybody's waiting for that joke at six o'clock in the morning as they wake up.  And here's the sad part of Kenny.  He will now repeat that joke to every single person he sees at Series XM.  Yeah, they deserve it.  They do deserve that joke today.  Yes. 
[00:05:30]  What's up with you and horror films?  They're not necessary.  I'm a pussy.  I don't search them out myself, but I don't walk around life like you, like a huge monster.  Yeah, I don't want the gory horror scary movies.  Was it gory, Jimmy?  Jimmy went and saw The Conjuring.  I went and saw it.  I was not alone.  I had the company of two young ladies.  Really?  A couple of young ladies.  Did you finally get to go to lunch? 
[00:06:00]  We did go to lunch.  Yes, we did.  Yes, we did.  That's all Jim Norton wants is to go to lunch.  He hasn't been able to find that one lady to go to lunch.  It wasn't quite a romantic interlude.  No, why not?  Who are these young ladies?  The young ladies might be interns at a certain radio company.  Come on.  Sam, why?  Do you have a problem with this?  I never got a lunch and a movie screening when I was an intern.  But you got a job out of it.  What, you're saying these girls don't have a shot at them?  Not, not, no. 
[00:06:30]  Of course not.  Why?  But they're perfect at what they do.  What, upping the mood?  Yes.  They've made this place a very, very happy place.  Are they here today?  Oh, yeah.  Can I?  How did it come about that you went to the movie with the two interns, Jim Norton?  I was honestly going by myself, and Roland just told me during the, I was at the gym and  he texted me and he said, oh yeah, the interns are going too.  We didn't arrange it that way.  It was literally just the way it worked out.  Yeah.  And, uh. 
[00:07:00]  Here they come.  Yeah, I didn't get to share a fancy meal with a celebrity like Jim Norton until years after  I was working here.  Yes, but you got to share many with me.  Now we've shared many, yes.  Maybe they should just do the whole show with us today.  What?  By the way, this shows you how comfortable the interns are.  Instead of both taking the one mic, fucking Sidney's in Anthony's chair.  They just spread out.  Put his headphones on, Sid.  Yeah, why not?  What are you doing?  You're here.  Am I right?  Sidney knows you.  What are they going to do?  Yell at me?  I'll just sit down in the aunt's seat. 
[00:07:30]  How do these buttons work?  Look at how Jackie sits in front of a mic.  Jackie's ready.  You're ready to broadcast, aren't you?  They're both very comfortable.  Yeah.  So did Jim Norton give you the invite, or was it one of these things where you guys all  just happened to go?  Roland invited us, but by the time, when me and Sidney got there, our names weren't even  on the list.  Roland should get fired for that.  We just dropped Roland's name and said he invited us.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Mine wasn't either.  It was all under Roland.  The guy goes, I came alone, and he goes, who at Warner Brothers, do you know? 
[00:08:00]  I'm like, Roland Campos?  But it works.  It did work.  I don't understand how all that works with him.  I don't understand how you've been in show business this long, and your contact at Warner  Brothers is Roland Campos.  Humiliating.  You knew the guy wouldn't know me.  But he was happy that some people from the show came, though.  The guy from Warner Brothers, he doesn't listen to the show, but he's like, what do you  do?  I'm like, oh, you know, we're on the air.  He goes, oh, wow.  It's good.  Thanks so much.  He was really nice.  They were very nice there.  Very cool. 
[00:08:30]  And they treated us.  Well, we're going to sell some tickets, I think, for this movie.  Why?  Because the interns went?  Yes.  It's ridiculous.  We were the only ones who screamed.  Yeah.  In the entire movie, we're the only ones.  We were the entire movie.  You're kind of giving away the punchline, because that's what Jimmy told me.  He said you two were the only ones screaming.  And then we'd laugh after, because we were the only ones.  Why wasn't anyone else screaming?  It was just, how many people were there?  Were there 25, 30, maybe 40?  Yeah.  Was it one of those tiny screening rooms?  Those things rule.  You know why nobody else was screaming?  Because they're all media people that didn't bring their cute female interns with them. 
[00:09:00]  That's why nobody was screaming.  Because Jeffrey Lines doesn't have a little 20-year-old intern to bring with him.  No, but they are the ones.  That reaction that they were giving the movie, it's like the movie company would spit on every  other person in that room.  Those are the ones that they wanted.  Do you really need a notepad for a horror movie?  Yeah, just writing.  This shot didn't work for me.  Yeah, they're just writing notes about a horror movie. 
[00:09:30]  Maybe some drama that's a little complicated, but not a horror movie.  That's like a fucking carnival ride.  Yeah.  Just go with it.  It was pretty scary.  I mean, honestly...  The trailer was horrifying.  Yeah.  And don't watch the trailer right before you go, because it shows you a lot of the scary  things.  But even with that, it's still a lot of it...  Every time they screamed, I literally felt like water was thrown on me.  Like, not annoyance, but I was equally frightened of what I was seeing. 
[00:10:00]  I just don't scream during horror movies.  I just kind of cave into myself and go like, oh...  He did.  He was leaning towards the other side, like in our little balls.  I was fucking...  There were a couple of parts of it that were truly horrifying.  Was it a bit of a turn-on that they were screaming?  No, but it was funny to me.  I'm used to hearing that sound.  Believe me.  But it was fun to watch.  I realized, like, I haven't watched a horror movie with screaming girls in...  Maybe my whole life, I've never sat in a theater with two screaming girls watching. 
[00:10:30]  It was fun.  Right.  That's the way you're supposed to enjoy the movie.  The guy in front of us did not find it fun.  No.  Why?  He was pissed off that you were screaming at a horror movie.  Yes, he shushed us.  Yeah.  And I shushed him back.  Who was it?  He was some guy writing.  He was, like, in the aisle seat.  Like, a big sweaty neck.  All sweaty.  Oh.  Yeah, it was terrible.  Down his neck.  And he was in the row in front of us.  And I guess they screamed at something.  But he didn't shush the scream.  It was after.  Because then all of a sudden, Jackie turned into a fucking black movie patron.  And she's like, why is she doing that? 
[00:11:00]  It was me on that loud, though.  In a screaming room.  Yeah.  Not in a movie theater.  Yeah.  It was, like, going on 125th Street.  And she starts, well, is he going that way?  And then the guy was like, shh.  And she shushed him back.  I hate to admit it, but I almost see it the other way with the guy.  Yeah.  You're signing with the guy.  Well, because these screening rooms are very serious.  Of course.  The whole reason to go to a screening room is because you're watching the movie in peace  so you can review it.  Well, they only invite people to the screening room that really could sell tickets for them 
[00:11:30]  or write a nice review or whatever.  It's all media people.  And there's two interns that are like, wow, three more people?  Yay.  It was the popcorn.  What do you mean they don't have popcorn?  No notepads.  They just walk in.  No.  It was good.  I thought it was really good.  It was scary.  It's just Facebooking the whole time.  Yeah.  So they have something over there.  They're people.  Look, I got to see The Conjuring already.  Nicki Minaj ringtone goes on. 
[00:12:00]  Who the fuck is here?  Yeah.  I kind of see it the other way.  Of course you should.  We don't use our phones at all, though.  In my eyes, these interns can't do no wrong, but I don't know.  Yeah.  I almost understand the shushing.  We did eavesdrop on that guy.  Yeah?  In the beginning.  He wanted to be an actor.  I mean, he was talking to himself during this conversation.  So me and Sidney just kind of listened to him.  What do you mean he was talking to himself?  His overall goal was to be, like, not a starring actor.  And he knew that.  Yeah.  He knew going into it. 
[00:12:30]  Who was he talking to?  Himself.  He was just kind of like, you know, I'm here.  And I don't know if he's talking to the guy in front of him, but he was kind of just projecting.  No one was listening.  It doesn't matter who he was talking to.  Was he talking to a, like, a device?  No.  No?  No.  I almost said tape record.  Thank God.  Well, now I did.  Now I did.  I know.  That's why I stopped.  I'm like, oh, they don't know what a tape record is.  Tape recorder is.  Jesus.  A device.  Thank you, Sidney.  I got to update that.  I always say tape recorder.  And what?  Do you want to be a character actor?  I don't know.  He just said, he was like, I knew from the beginning I would never be a star. 
[00:13:00]  But, you know, you could tell he really wanted to be a star.  Who was he talking to?  I don't know.  He really wasn't talking to anything?  I swear to God, he really wasn't talking to anybody.  Holy.  He was, like, reading the pamphlet they gave you and kind of just like, oh, look at this guy.  I could have been him.  Yeah.  That's what it was.  Went on with the conversation to himself.  Weird.  Yeah.  Creepy.  So I didn't really care that he shushed me.  How was Jimmy during the conjuring?  I was upset he didn't scream at all.  I mean, he looked scared. 
[00:13:30]  I was frightened.  I had to be macho, though.  You know.  Obviously.  Just in case.  In case the gals showed a little.  Get him out of there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had to know they were safe.  Except for one part you did scream.  Did I make a noise?  On top of the.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Did I make a noise?  I didn't even mean to do it.  What kind of noise was it?  It wasn't really a scream.  It was just like, look at that.  Yeah, I did gasp at once.  There was a couple that really, it was, there was a few horrifying moments.  And the people in front of us, there was a, there was a guy against the wall, because 
[00:14:00]  we were only like six seats deep.  And he had a woman with him, and she didn't scream, but she was cowering against him.  Right.  People were frightened, man.  It was, there was some terrifying moments in that film.  You guys like it?  Oh, yeah.  It was really scary, but it was good.  You like scary movies?  No.  I hate them.  No.  No, me neither.  The last one I saw was the first Paranormal Activity, and I didn't want to go see a scary  movie after that.  I like, I'm awful with scary movies.  I like the scream movies, actually. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, those are those like, like kind of teeny bopper horror movies.  Yeah, I like that.  I do too.  I enjoyed that for some reason, but I don't, I don't, I haven't seen The Ring, any of those.  That was scary.  The first time I saw The Ring, I was alone.  Keith Robinson got me a copy of it, and I watched it in my old apartment by myself when  we were off the air, and I was so fucking freaked out, I had to like, leave the lights  on in my apartment.  That was the last Leave Your Lights On movie.  I just lived in my sister's bed for like a week.  I was terrified. 
[00:15:00]  It was frightening.  Really?  The TV had to leave the room.  It was all going to pop on on me.  Well, The Conjuring got to all of us, because we watched the trailer yesterday, right before  I went to bed last night, I actually prayed that I wouldn't have weird fucking dreams about  The Conjuring.  Just based on the trailer?  Yeah, I said to myself, please, no, don't wake me up in the middle of the night where  I thought I saw or heard something.  Not tonight.  That's when you know that it's like a good...  I was a little fucking nervous that I would have those weird dreams about, you know, what  I saw. 
[00:15:30]  When you know it's a good scary movie, it's like you go and see it, and then you go about  the rest of your day and forget about it, and then when you go to sleep, like the movie  starts creeping back into your head, and you're like, oh my God.  Sydney did that to me.  Oh my God.  I forgot about it all day, and then Sydney goes, oh yeah, I just remembered.  I'm like, oh God, now I'm scared right before bed.  I'm screwed.  It's going to attack me.  Are you guys good friends now?  Yeah, we tweet.  Yeah.  You'll be friends after this experience?  Mm-hmm.  I would say so.  I mean, she's in Florida, though, and I'll be in New York.  That's a no from Jackie.  No, I'm just not going to fly in Florida. 
[00:16:00]  Sydney's all like, yeah, I think so.  Yeah, I'd love to, but there's a great distance between.  Yeah, this day and age, you just can't figure out how to keep in touch.  Lines of communication get broken.  Yeah, that's how it is.  When I was growing up, you had to write a letter.  Now you can just fucking text each other.  I know.  It doesn't matter where you fucking live, Jackie.  Absolutely.  Skype.  Right.  What got me was that my ex and I had been texting, so I told her about the movie and  how scary it was, and then before I went to bed, I looked at a text that she had sent 
[00:16:30]  and it was something about, oh, it was so scary, and I'm like, fuck, and I had to think  of it again.  And it was, it's like weird.  I get up to pee where I'm like, I know I can't be uncomfortable because I'm 44 years  old, but I still was like, you know, like, it's almost like you're talking shit to yourself  as you're going, like, what is our fucking ghost here?  Like that aggressive conversation you have, but you're really frightened.  But you couldn't even tell yourself it wasn't real because the movie was based on a true 
[00:17:00]  story.  So you're like, well, then what am I supposed to do?  This is real.  Well, I think Hollywood came up with that shit just to make, you know, the people going  to the movie more scared.  I bet you it's loosely based on a true story.  You know what I mean?  I'm going to read up on that.  As soon as you see it across the screen based on a true story, it freaks you out even more.  Well, they, um, I don't even think that popped up in the beginning.  It was a whole paragraph.  Oh, did I?  Yeah, it was a paragraph about that.  Oh, so you weren't paying attention.  I wasn't.  I was like, I'm not going to read those words.  Yeah, I was reading.  I didn't want to read that. 
[00:17:30]  Stupid words.  Until the monsters pop out.  I think it was like a whole book before it even started.  Because you're in a special screening, so when you talk about the movie, you know what you're  talking about.  Well, it's because people write, like, newspaper articles and they need information.  Right.  So they want to make sure they know all the character names and all that, so it's all in  front of them.  Yeah, it's not like people are going to go to, like, the movie theater and everybody gets  a book about the conjuring.  Yeah, that was a special, special thing that they gave.  It was pretty scary, man.  I fucking, the story got me, there was, again, like I said, a couple of cheese dick horror 
[00:18:00]  things that they didn't do, that they could have done, like, that I kind of wanted them  to do, because I wanted that, and they just avoided it.  I was like, oh, okay.  They kind of had integrity.  And there was like one or two moments that they could have probably made scarier, but  they didn't go the fucking completely hack route.  And there was a couple of scary shit, man.  I would absolutely recommend seeing it.  I think it's going to do great.  When does it come out?  This weekend?  Yeah, I think Friday.  And the same, by the way, the same couple that this is based on, also are the couple 
[00:18:30]  who are the Amityville Horror, that that's supposed to be a true story, too.  Right.  It's the same couple of witch hunter, ghost hunter people.  Well, they're not the people, like, George Lutz's name wasn't, I forget his wife's name.  Lorraine.  Lorraine Lutz, okay, they were the folks from Long Island.  These guys are not them.  No, the ghost hunters.  Wait, what's the connection?  The ghost hunters were...  Were also involved in the Amityville Horrors.  It's like a prequel.  Yeah, it's like before Amityville. 
[00:19:00]  They make the joke at the end.  71, yeah.  When I was in high school, we would go to the Amityville Horror House.  We would get, like, drunk.  We'd have, dare I say, some road sodas.  We thought we'd be cool.  I'm like, hey, let's go to the house tonight.  And we'd go there at night, like, around 11, 12.  Fucking creepy as shit, seeing that house.  Well, it's just that, whatever the design of that barn.  But they got rid of that.  Is that gone?  Yeah, they finally, this is years ago now, they finally sold the house and the new owner 
[00:19:30]  said, fuck that, we don't want people stopping in front of our house all night.  So they redesigned the whole front of it.  Oh, they did.  So it doesn't look like the house from the movie.  The book was scary.  I mean, when I was in school, everybody had read the book and it was fucking frightening.  And I think the, what was it, the bar the guy went to after the murders?  I don't remember.  Was pretty much right on the corner.  Ronnie DeFeo.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you remember when that happened?  I don't remember when the murders happened.  I don't know.  I would have to say the 70s, right?  I want to say, I'm going to guess 74 is when all that went down. 
[00:20:00]  I don't know if 74 is the murders or when the actual haunting happened.  I'm going to guess 74 is the murders.  I think it's a haunting.  Was it?  Because this one was 71, so it would have had to have been, at least after, so the killings  would have had to have been before 71.  You learned all that without even reading the book.  I've seen the Amityville Horror movie with Ryan Reynolds.  Well, that was a remake.  They read the movie years ago.  What, Sam?  She likes Ryan Reynolds.  I saw your face.  Don't try it.  You're trying. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, that was it.  The movie was like maybe, uh...  Nobody should be able to get away with...  You look so beautiful.  So beautiful in this studio.  I mean, come on.  What year was the Ronnie DeFeo murders?  I think he killed his whole family in the house.  Yeah, and then I think he went to the local bar, if I remember correctly.  Was he just a nut?  He was just like a, what, a kook?  Of course.  Yeah, he wasn't possessed or anything.  No.  That was, by the way, a scary scene in the original movie, I think.  How many movies were on the Amityville Horror?  There was the remake she's talking about in the original. 
[00:21:00]  They went way too far with the whole thing.  Yeah, I think they did three sequels.  Oh, my God.  Something like that.  And then a remake.  And then they, yeah.  There was one that showed Ronnie walking through the house, and it was fucking terrifying.  Because I guess because you know that really happened.  What year was it, Sam?  74.  Wow.  Jimmy nailed it.  It was when he was convicted of the killing.  Oh.  When he was convicted.  So he probably did it.  Oh, Jimmy.  But the conviction, who knows how long of a trial was it, Sam?  It couldn't have happened.  No, it was around 6.30 p.m. November 1974. 
[00:21:30]  He entered Henry's Bar in Amityville, Long Island and declared, you gotta help me.  Yeah, it was November 13th, 74.  Okay.  That it happened.  And he was convicted when?  Right after that, I guess.  He probably just admitted it.  He said, fuck it.  I did it.  Okay.  He was found guilty a year later in 75.  That's it.  Yep.  Nowadays, man, you don't get all that happening in one year.  It takes forever.  It was probably a bunch.  I'm going to guess it was a lot of competency stuff.  Because I think he was, they didn't know if he was, they called him Bad Boy Ronnie for  whatever reason.  He was just crazy, they thought.  Yeah.  But I bet I was known as Boy Most Likely to come up with an accurate stage. 
[00:22:00]  Very good at that.  See, I can't get over that, like, this dude is there.  It's his job to watch these movies and just review them.  But he watches movies quietly, like a reviewer should.  And when he shushes the girl, who he doesn't know why this young girl is there.  Right.  Who's talking, she shushes him back.  I do.  Good for you.  Well, I didn't want to hear him anymore.  I mean, I said one thing. 
[00:22:30]  I said one thing.  I was interested.  It was awesome.  I mean, it's not like I was screaming.  Why'd she go in there?  I was like, oh, why'd she go in there?  Yeah, it wasn't distracting.  Like, what's bringing to Sydney?  Why, why would she do that?  You know what, though?  If you're a movie reviewer, you know, maybe you're looking at the film way too closely.  Yeah.  So then you got these two girls that have no business being in there, but they're  basically regular moviegoers.  Wouldn't you pay close attention to what they're, you know, reacting to, and that would help  your review? 
[00:23:00]  It's like a director putting up with the test screen audience's opinion.  Right.  Well, what I think is they should have.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I would have added to my review that, you know, and these two broads were screaming  throughout the whole fucking movie.  Somebody might.  I'd write it just like that, too.  They might get mentioned in somebody's review that they were screaming.  I hope so.  They may actually think that the movie companies planted you there.  They, they were such screamers.  They sounded like movie company plants.  Right.  It was.  It was really bad.  My throat hurt at the end.  As I had a sip of water.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were fucking hollering up a storm. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, Christ.  A lot of stuff just popped out at you.  I screamed at something I shouldn't have even, like a bird flying into a window.  I freaked out.  I was like, okay.  That's some good movie making, Sam.  When they get you to scream for, you know, things that, you know, weren't the scary parts.  And only one guy shushed them.  But, you know, every single reviewer in there is like, it's a fucking bird.  Why are they still screaming?  Well, they take their jobs a little too seriously.  That's true.  I don't know if that would bother people, though.  To see a horror movie with people who are screaming, it didn't seem to affect anybody negatively. 
[00:24:00]  Like, I didn't see anybody looking back.  There's one black guy behind us.  Right.  And I heard him kind of chuckling at something that you guys screamed at.  But it was, it didn't seem like anybody was annoyed at the yelling.  I used to go to the screenings with Patrice O'Neal.  It was one of the things we did a lot together.  And one of my favorite moments ever with Patrice O'Neal, it was Cloverfield.  I remember that.  Were you there, too?  I was, yeah.  Okay.  There wasn't many people in the theater.  Were you there, too, Sam?  Yeah, I was.  Okay.  Who was the reviewer? 
[00:24:30]  Jeffrey Lyons.  It was Jeffrey Lyons.  He's a fucking stiff.  So Patrice is, like, you know, just laughing out loud at ridiculous parts of the movie and  just enjoying himself.  And we're enjoying Patrice watching the movie, basically.  Because Patrice treated it like the girls treated it.  He always treated it like he's just at the movie.  Yeah, he's like, fuck, I get to see this movie before anyone else.  Right.  That's how we looked at it.  You're right.  Right.  So the credits roll on Cloverfield, and he basically said, skip it.  Was that exactly what he said? 
[00:25:00]  No, I think, in my memory.  I don't want to get this wrong.  I thought it was just skip it.  In my memory, the credits are rolling, and Patrice is just in his chair going, boo.  Oh, that's what it was.  Okay.  I knew it was better.  Yeah.  I knew it was better.  I would be a horrible spokesperson for fucking Patrice O'Neal as we try to keep his name  alive.  Yeah, because that's way funnier.  Yeah, he's just going, boo, boo.  He had his big dumb hat on.  Right.  And Jeffrey Lyons just turns to Patrice so annoyed and goes, no one asked you. 
[00:25:30]  I was like, God, relax.  I felt the same way, because I loved it.  Everyone hated it, but me.  I liked it.  It was awful.  I loved it.  I mean, motion sickness.  That's what a lot of people felt.  I loved it.  I got what they were going for, but they could have made it less shaky, still had that same  effect, and I think that movie would have done really well, because the story itself was  kind of cool.  Yeah.  You know?  That's what bothered a lot of people.  But they blew it with that shaky cam, because I, too, got really fucking nauseous during that. 
[00:26:00]  I looked down so many times during that movie, I just couldn't handle it.  Did they ever show the creature either?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They did.  I thought they did it.  In a second, when T.J. Miller, who was the camera guy, was getting picked up and eaten,  they showed him for a second.  Oh, yes.  It looked great, too.  And then it falls down.  And the helicopter shots.  Oh, yep.  Right.  Yeah.  I think so, right?  They made a mistake.  Yeah, they missed a little bit.  With that shaky cam.  I don't know.  I enjoyed it.  I did, too, man.  I couldn't believe how much it felt like it's such an original movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Keegan and Utica. 
[00:26:30]  Keegan.  Yep.  Hi, Keegan.  What's up?  Hey, I heard someone mention Paranormal Activity, and you're talking about people screaming  in theaters.  I actually had this.  The movie wasn't the best form I've ever seen, but the experience is one that was like,  the absolute best.  Halfway through, I'm like, oh, man, I got to piss, and they're just talking, so, like,  I got time.  I go out, go to the bathroom.  I'm walking back.  I'm not making this up. 
[00:27:00]  Door slams open to the theater.  A large, sweating black woman is running out screaming, yelling, fuck that shit.  It puts me out of the way, and I'm like, all right.  I'm walking back.  People start jumping as I'm walking past them.  I sit down.  My wife looks at me, and she's like, you fucking missed it.  I'm like, missed what?  I didn't, the whole movie, everybody else knows exactly what just happened.  I missed the big moment. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, that's funny.  It's always weird when you're pissed.  I had to sneak out once during the film, and I tried to do it in a place when the, these  guys are, when there was, I don't think I really missed anything.  I almost did, but, you know, it's hard when you got pissed on a horror film.  Right.  Oh, that's funny, Keegan.  Good job.  Let's go to Canada and say hi to Jody, Jody Jacobs from Canada.  What's up, Jody?  Jody.  By the way, Jody was the pig's name in Amityville Horror.  Right on, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Jody. 
[00:28:00]  Hey, Jody.  I just got a story here.  Me and my fiancee actually lived in this house for about a year.  This was three years ago.  And a bunch of fucking weird shit started happening through there, like lights and shit  were coming on all hours of the night, two o'clock, three o'clock in the morning.  And we had three kids.  They were, they were hearing children laughing upstairs.  It got to the point where I actually had to fucking get up and search for fucking something  that was actually there or wasn't there.  And everything just went to fucking shit.  We actually had to move out of there. 
[00:28:30]  We lived there roughly for about a year.  So it was pretty fucking creepy shit, man.  There was a lot of shit going on.  Like what?  What else?  Well, fucking another thing was like, like downstairs, like the basement, fucking nobody wants  to go into the fucking basement.  This was like a low rental place, right?  And we were having, like I would have nightmares in the basement.  So would Aaron, my fiancee.  And the kids would fucking definitely not go down there.  We'd hear footsteps.  People sort of fucking, just fucking around, like laughing and talking. 
[00:29:00]  And it was, it was all fucking whack.  This, this went on for roughly probably about, like the year that we stayed there for a year.  It happened roughly for about six months, the last six months.  My fiancee never believed in any of that shit until that stuff started happening.  And once that started happening, we had to fucking move out of there.  Like, I don't know what to believe, but there's, uh, we could take it.  We could take two hours of, um, stories easily.  I become such a cynic with it.  I'm not, I really don't know what to believe, but I mean, this guy, you were convinced there 
[00:29:30]  was some shit going on in that house though.  No, I was, I was definitely convinced, man.  And I'm like, I'm not one of those spiritual fucking guys who believe in, you know, I'll  have to actually see it before it actually believe it, you know, and shit, like that  was fucking happening.  And kids don't lie, man.  You know, like the kids were fucking hearing shit here.  Yes, they do.  Well, you know, these kids are like, uh, uh, three, five and seven.  So it was, it was fucking, it was definitely right off the fucking hook. 
[00:30:00]  You know, I'm glad I was out of that fucking place.  That's for sure.  I wouldn't bullshit you guys.  You guys are my, uh, favorite turds.  That's for sure.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, Jody.  Thank you, brother.  My, um, my brother lived in an old house in Westchester and he swears it was haunted.  So, and he's, he's a level-headed guy.  He's one of the level-headed ones in my family.  And the first time I went to see him,  he, you know, I was sleeping on a pull-out couch downstairs in the living room and just,  what a fucking asshole, but this is my family.  And just as he's turning off the lights upstairs, he goes, oh, by the way, the house is haunted. 
[00:30:30]  And then turns the lights off for the night.  And I'm like, you gotta be fucking kidding me.  And I just, I just waited till the sun came up.  All the, that's all the talk?  Yeah.  Because it was an old house to begin with.  So it had a weird vibe to it.  And the creaky, the creaky.  I didn't hear, I'm not going to sit here and say I heard anything.  No, I didn't hear anything.  But him just saying that was like, great.  So I had a shitty night's sleep.  Wow.  And I couldn't wait for the sun to come up.  Couldn't wait.  And then he told me stories that the toilets would flush on their own.  And people have explained that that could happen just if you have shitty plumbing. 
[00:31:00]  But he would talk about how doors would slam really hard in the middle of the night.  And he was convinced there was some weird shit going on in that house.  That's creepy.  What was the whispering?  Look what she made me do.  Look what they made me.  Or she made me.  Oh, yeah.  Or she was screaming.  But in the conjuring?  Or she was like, follow me.  This is my hiding spot.  And they're whispering, clap.  Look what she made me do.  Oh, I can't even think about it.  Freaks me out.  That was what the whisper was.  Look what she made me do.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, yeah.  Look what she made me do.  No. 
[00:31:30]  Scary.  Yeah.  No.  And the clap was kind of creepy.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was some fucking very creepy, isolating moments.  Do we have us watching the Conjuring trailer, E-Rock?  Yes, we do.  I want to play that into the break.  People enjoyed it yesterday.  They thought it was hilarious.  Okay.  I was just watching the stupid trailer.  And then Jimmy and the interns actually went and saw the movie yesterday.  Let's say hi to Adam in Houston.  Adam.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Adam. 
[00:32:00]  I don't want to be critical, but you guys are dangerously close to jumping the shark with  this intern stuff.  I, you know, I always live my life by thinking about what would Patrice think.  And I do not think Patrice would be overly happy with these white girl interns getting  so much air time.  I know you think that, sir, and you sound like a very mentally stable man, but you misread 
[00:32:30]  Patrice then.  I think you don't understand that he would have understood the enjoyment of hearing female  voices as opposed to male voices all the time.  I think you're completely wrong, actually.  And you know what Patrice would have loved?  The underlying current of every minute they're on the air, the boy intern is not.  Of course.  Like, that sort of antagonistic.  You really didn't know Patrice, Adam.  He would totally get what we're doing with this. 
[00:33:00]  And I know Patrice had a weird take on you.  Because in the end, you idiot, it's a bit.  Yeah.  Not to tear down a wall, but the whole fucking thing's a bit.  Of course they're shitty interns like every other intern we've had.  But they just look good.  Yeah, I don't know if it's cool about that.  Fuck, I think fully a bitch was yours.  I have to disagree on that.  I didn't mean that.  Sorry.  What are you apologizing?  I didn't mean it.  That guy just got me mad.  I didn't mean any of that.  She's shushing movie reviews.  She's in movie screenings.  You're apologizing. 
[00:33:30]  You're offering, why don't they have him do the whole show today?  There are no bids here.  But Patrice would love these two because they're nice.  If you were nice and you were just, you know, because you were a woman, he wasn't going to  be ultra critical for no reason.  Right.  It was certain attitudes that he criticized and certain people who have entitlement.  But you guys are just, you know, you're going along with it.  You're having fun.  There's a difference.  And you don't find it funny that they went to a special screening and they were just screaming  the whole time.  That's great.  Is he gone?  Yeah, he just left.  I didn't hang up on him.  Slurping their soda. 
[00:34:00]  No, there was no beverage.  No, you can't.  We couldn't even find the place to begin with.  We had to call Roland.  Well, because they're like hidden.  These screening rooms are in these buildings and all of a sudden they open up to these  amazing theaters that only like, I don't know, 25 fucking people could go to.  Yeah.  The reason they're hidden is so people like Jackie and Sidney don't show up at them.  Yeah.  You just show up and say, you know, Roland, you're allowed in here on A.  We'll just do it from now on.  We should have like 500 listeners show up to the screening.  Yeah.  Who do you know, Roland?  Roland sent us. 
[00:34:30]  Good old Roland.  The fucking narcoleptic guy that works at Sirius.  Creepy.  He's well connected though.  It amazes me to this day.  You guys got to go see it.  Yeah, maybe today.  You have to see it tonight, man.  Maybe we'll see it tonight.  Yeah, you should.  Oh, but now it's in a regular theater tonight, I think.  That's even better.  I mean, even though we saw it where we saw it.  Actually, that would be better, right?  I'd prefer to see it with half.  You should be sure it's the next two 20-year-old girls that you get the full experience.  Yeah.  Or black people because they react properly to horror films.  Of course they do.  I feel like it would be scarier in a bigger theater too. 
[00:35:00]  I mean, it was so small in that one.  You're all close together.  It would be like feeding off of each other's feet.  Yeah.  I feel like we would have screamed more if it was a bigger.  I don't know if that's possible, but, you know, we would have figured a way out.  When else would you have screamed?  During the opening credits?  Yeah, I guess.  I guess the seats would have probably too separated in the screening room for you two  to clutch on to Jim in fear.  No, they were right next to each other.  Everything was right there. 
[00:35:30]  Not that I need validation, but I do want to go to another caller about the Patrice thing.  Sean in Jersey.  Go ahead, Sean.  Kobe, big-time fan, long-time listener.  Got it, got it, got it.  All right.  Thanks, Sean.  I think that caller was definitely wrong.  This definitely would have been one of those mornings where Patrice would have brought up  the power of vagina.  Exactly.  Exactly.  He would have totally got this.  He would have been laughing in our faces and doing that point like, ah, because he would 
[00:36:00]  know exactly what this was about.  Absolutely.  We all miss him.  Oh, God.  I still can't listen to Patrice's comedy.  To this day, I still can't do it.  Thank you, Sean.  No problem.  All right.  I want to get to that point where I could just fucking put on his CDs and just laugh instead  of being like, fuck, way too early on this one, man.  All right. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, drive-in.  Hold on.  One more call.  Jen in Boston.  Jen.  Morning, guys.  Good morning, Jen.  We took the drive-in in Milford, New Hampshire.  We saw Despicable Me, so my kids were all excited.  And the preview in between the movies was a frigging conjuring.  Why would they do that?  Absolutely, my kids were horrified.  Oh, good.  Of course they were horrified.  Why would you do that?  We're in the middle of the fucking woods.  And this movie, they were just the side. 
[00:37:00]  They couldn't even deal with them.  Wait, this is the drive-in?  The drive-in.  How great would it be to see the conjuring in a drive-in?  I went to that drive-in.  It's a cool, old-school drive-in in the Boston area in the suburbs.  Oh, you know where it is?  The one she means?  I believe so, yeah.  Because there's not many left, right, Jen?  No, no.  There's one in Menden, Mass.  And then there's one in Milford, New Hampshire.  And we were up in...  Oh, okay.  I think I'm talking...  I'm thinking the one in Massachusetts.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  It's the one in New Hampshire. 
[00:37:30]  Right.  I saw the trailer for The Conjuring when I saw The Purge.  That made sense.  Right.  The Speakable Me is the worst.  No!  Why would they do that?  But wait, when you watch them drive-in now, is it the same type of hang speaker?  There's got to be a better way.  I haven't gone in years.  They're still right next to you.  They got the speakers, but you can also change it to your car.  You can change the station.  That's for show.  Because now they got it on your radio.  Oh, how does it sound?  Jackie's talking about the one outside Rochester.  We got four in Rochester.  I went to a few fucking drive-ins in the Rochester area. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Drive-ins are awesome.  You have four drive-ins in Rochester?  Yeah, 45 minutes each direction.  They're the greatest, too.  We used to go on just a boring night with a bunch of, dare I say, roach sodas.  We brought a grill one time.  Yeah.  And they don't give a fuck.  No.  They let you do whatever the hell you want in Rochester.  They're not so fucking, fucking just, what's the word I'm looking for?  Uptight.  Uptight is absolutely the word.  So we would set up a whole fucking, like, picnic. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Blankets, grills, beers.  Yeah, we get about, like, ten people to go who get, like, a couple different cars.  But are they popular?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're still really popular.  Yeah.  There was one when I was up there, which is way too long ago now, but there was a whole  lawn in front of the fucking screen.  So you parked your car, and then you moved all your shit in front.  Had, like, a little picnic.  How'd you hear?  I don't remember anymore.  I'm trying to think if they had speakers in that area, or people just kind of cranked up  their cars in the front row.  Is there a plan iPhone app now that you could fucking pick? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, all that, I'm sure.  It's probably off by a half a second.  It's always annoying.  Right.  I've been going to a drive-in.  Last thing I, I remember seeing E.T. in the drive-in.  We hopped the fence and went and saw E.T.  That's how I saw E.T.  I haven't been in fucking years.  My grandma had a house in Waiting River.  On the way home, we'd take the country road, and I think in Riverhead, they had a drive-in.  And we would always just get the glimpse of the fucking Disney movie as we're driving  by on a hot summer night. 
[00:39:30]  It was the coolest thing ever.  Like, holy fuck, there's a movie going on over there.  Yeah.  You would think my parents would stop just once.  Yeah.  It was like a glimmer of the movie.  That's all I got, but for some weird reason, it's a great childhood memory for myself.  For a split second.  Now I think about it, I'm like, fuck my parents.  Why didn't they go in?  Once.  Yeah, that movie was probably 50 cents.  You're right.  Yeah.  I'm thinking of it as a lovely memory.  I saw, if the light was red, we got to see an extra minute of the movie. 
[00:40:00]  You drove past a fun place.  Right.  You're right, Sam.  That's a terrible memory.  They took the country road to drive you past that place.  Possibly to get free entertainment.  Just to show you what bad boys don't get.  I love doing radio with these two.  What?  They're very observant, Sam.  They're just giggling.  They got follow-up questions and, you know, thoughts.  Good commentary.  Good commentary.  They keep the story going.  She added a lot there.  I understand, but there's never been a compliment given to a person in here. 
[00:40:30]  They're just wonderful.  You have to pause to mention how great they are for conversation?  Yeah.  And they still have the sign, I think, that says Riverhead Drive-In, but the thing is long gone.  I think there's, like, a Home Depot back there or something.  But you're right.  Why the fuck do they never stop?  They just wanted to show you.  They wanted to get us home.  You know, we'd spent the weekends at Waiting River, so it was time to fucking get home, I guess.  Do you have to...  Can you buy tickets in advance for drive-in?  There's no drive-ins around here.  No, but I'm saying, like, up in New Hampshire or Rochester or whatever. 
[00:41:00]  I would love to go to one.  I don't think so.  It's like a regular movie theater.  Yeah, you just go there.  Oh, Rocky Point.  Hold on.  How do you know?  You can't just drive up there and it's sold out.  You could probably be Fandango.  It's never sold out.  No.  Never.  You should go to a drive-in.  I want to.  I have a comfortable car just to relax.  Let me just get John on the phone.  I fucked up that whole thing.  It's actually the Rocky Point drive-in.  He's absolutely right.  I was thinking Riverhead, but...  John, go ahead.  Yeah, how you doing, O.P.?  It's the Rocky Point, where my great-grandparents had a place in Rocky Point, a summer house. 
[00:41:30]  We should go out there all the time.  And then we'd stop on the way home.  My father would take us in there, you know, and we'd watch another movie.  But it was great, Rocky Point, in those days, you know?  What the fuck?  Wait, but your parents stopped.  My parents never stopped.  Do you understand this?  And we were going to Wading River, especially in the summer, easily ten straight years.  We didn't stop once on the way home.  It wasn't one and done.  We saw this Rocky Point drive-in over and over again. 
[00:42:00]  You see how much better his pleasant childhood memory is than yours?  Fuck!  He got to watch the movie.  Yeah, man.  Hey, not only that, O.P. had a great playground there, don't you?  I wouldn't know!  And I'd catch a glimpse of a movie as I drove by, okay?  And it used to be a one-lane road, and then they'd turn it into a two-laner, so the lights  were more, stayed green longer, so then I really didn't get a glimpse of the damn thing.  No.  Just a bunch of kids in there enjoying cartoons. 
[00:42:30]  Having fun.  Yeah.  Yeah, why didn't they ever stop?  Headed home.  That was one of the last drive-ins, too, all from around.  Yeah, I think so.  Wasn't there one in, oh, this is too local.  There was one in Bayshore.  I'm going to say Comac.  It was Comac.  It was Schmitttown.  It was at the Cock.  Huh?  What about the conch?  Everyone in the conch?  We used to go to Schmitttown.  We used to throw kids in the trunk and everything.  I think Schmitttown.  I think we got a glimpse of that movie screen once as well, yes. 
[00:43:00]  But for some reason, they didn't think this would be a good family activity to go to a  drive-in.  Well, I'm sorry about that, but it was a great time.  I wouldn't know.  Well, I kind of know from the nice glimpse.  Thanks, John.  My dad took me to a drive-in.  I forget what we saw, but I remember that the late feature was The Sensuous Nurse starring  Ursula Andrews, and I wanted to stay and watch it.  He was like, no, I'm not taking you to watch The Sensuous Nurse.  Had a drive-in?  Yeah, I didn't know how inappropriate that would be for father and son to watch The Sensuous 
[00:43:30]  Nurse.  But you know what?  You know how desperately he wanted to see that movie, but he was with you like, fuck.  Yeah, he probably went to throw me in the trunk and then fucking whack his bag all over  the thermos.  Well, you know what?  You just set up the next phone call, because I was about to say, this guy's bullshitting.  But now, after what you just said, I have to believe.  Eric in Indy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hi.  What do you got, buddy?  Yeah, we were, I didn't live in Indiana, and until the early 80s, in the middle of the 
[00:44:00]  country, in the middle of nowhere, there was a Triple X drive-in theater.  So, growing up, as a teenager, you would sneak by there and watch Triple X movies on this  huge screen.  Well, this movie, how did you do that outdoors?  Were you able to get a glimpse as you drove by?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, it was a huge screen.  How could you not?  There was a six-foot fence, but you stood back ten feet.  Sam, we come from a way better time than you guys.  I know you guys got youth, but we had some shit that went down when we were going up. 
[00:44:30]  And the census nurse, by the way, was rated R. It was not rated X.  The movie I was talking about was rated R.  It was a hard R, though.  Yeah.  You know what I'm talking about.  They would show some things.  It was probably mild compared to a lot of, you know, I've seen it since.  It's not mild if you're 13 years old.  Oh, God, I want to crank to it.  Get you frothing.  Just the idea of there being any kind of titty on a drive-in screen is, like, amazing.  Right.  Oh, yeah, there was.  Oh, that's huge.  And there was just Harry Bush everywhere. 
[00:45:00]  There was Harry Bush everywhere.  Yeah.  But how great would that be if you're just driving, like, late at night home and you catch a glimpse of a titty?  Then that's a nice memory.  And didn't some of the drive-ins have it where you could tune your radio in so you could hear the audio from the movie instead of having to put the speaker on?  Well, we would kind of do that.  You're bringing up another memory.  When we knew we were getting close to the Rocky Point drive-in, we would tune it in so we'd get to hear, you know, the movie for a couple miles.  We would only get to see it at the red light, but we'd get to hear it for a couple miles. 
[00:45:30]  So, like, as you were approaching, you could hear what was going on.  You're like, I can't wait to see this for a second.  Yes.  And then we'd roll down the windows and six of us in a tiny car would all poke our heads out looking at the movie quickly.  That's a hard memory.  Why did they ever stop?  This is really...  Did you ever ask?  I might have to go back to therapy.  I've got to figure this one out.  No, I thought it was a great memory until we started talking about it.  Yeah.  Now I'm realizing it's just sick. 
[00:46:00]  Had you never gone to...  I swear we never went.  Not once.  And this Rocky Point drive-in was, I don't know, like 20 minutes from Waiting River.  That's like on some Orphan Annie shit.  That's weird, right?  Yeah.  All the kids having fun inside.  You could almost smell chocolate chip cookies when you're going by.  Done for you.  I guess they're a thought process.  We just had a great weekend at the beach house and it was just time to get everyone fucking home.  Oh, that's the last thing they wanted to do was listen to you six in the backseat.  Right.  Well, they fucking wanted to get home, yeah.  Six, sometimes seven. 
[00:46:30]  Sometimes eight, actually.  Oh, my God.  Sometimes eight in that car.  Jesus.  That's all it was.  My made-up sister, Karen, that came and went.  I had a made-up sister.  No, I didn't know.  But she had red hair, so it kind of made sense.  She went from my sister's best friend to my sister, like, within a weekend.  Your sister's best friend to your sister?  My...  Like, so now this is our sister now.  Yeah.  No longer your sister's best friend.  Yeah, yeah.  It's so weird.  And she had reddish hair, so it kind of worked. 
[00:47:00]  I think the whole thing...  And even when we put our initials in the cement outside our house, we added her initial.  I thought you meant, like, an imaginary friend.  No, no, no, no, man.  Like a real person.  We just started being a sister.  We said a made-up sister.  That makes it a little weirder.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Oh, man.  I think the whole thing with, like, your family bringing in kids at odd points, so you have  these weird, like, pseudo-siblings is a very...  I've always thought that it's very strange that your parents did that.  Yeah, they meant well, but then, you know, then Karen hated my mom, and one day just 
[00:47:30]  left, and I never saw her again.  That's the pseudo-sister?  Yeah.  Never saw her again.  How long?  I guess, like, some of my siblings, you know, got back in touch with her because of Facebook.  Oh.  You know, 20-some-odd years later.  Are you curious?  Yeah, sure.  She was around a couple years, I think.  One day, she just had a boyfriend that packed up a pickup truck with her shit, and she  said, I'm out of here.  Oh, like Mickey and Mallory.  Right.  And I'm just a kid. 
[00:48:00]  I'm like, what do you mean you're out of here?  You're my sister now.  They told me you're my sister.  Oh, he's crying.  And then she said that she'd be back to, you know, visit or whatever, and we never saw  her again.  Where'd she come from?  A broken home.  Oh.  Yeah, her father was getting remarried, and the new one actually said that, you know,  it's her or me.  Wow.  Oh, my gosh.  And the father said, all right, it's you.  So now her daughter needed a place to live.  Oh, that's a rough one. 
[00:48:30]  And she was only a teenager, and she was probably 14, 15 at the time.  That was it.  Wow.  Yeah, that'd be so weird to bring in, like, because it's almost like bringing in foster  kids.  And then she would sneak cigarettes, and smell the cigarettes smoke at night.  She was a bad girl.  She was a naughty one.  She'd cough.  She'd cough because you already had smokers long at 15, 16.  If I was your parents, taking in some girl who was there because her dad said he didn't  want her anymore, and she was still acting up?  Right.  I'd be so pissed. 
[00:49:00]  That's so ungrateful.  In general, I don't think she acted up.  I mean, smoking is acting up.  Most people know I had a mom that was a little unusual.  Yeah.  And, you know, this one's like, what?  I don't have to deal with this.  Right.  I'm out of here.  Yeah, she don't need parents.  A strange way of enforcing the rules.  Yeah, it was kind of cool she didn't need parents.  Yeah, she didn't need parents.  It was a little erotic.  Did you ever whack your back to her?  No, no.  To be honest, no.  But she's not really your sister, I guess.  I felt that it was a little erotic. 
[00:49:30]  The independence was sexy.  And she walked around our house like a little hippie.  Oh, I like that.  You know what that means, right?  No bra.  Yes.  What?  Sorry, sir.  You watch her just fucking just tits jiggling.  Her not my sister tits jiggling.  But then they say it was my sister.  So, you know, you got that confusion in your head.  And then the red hair kind of, you know, brought it all together.  Oh, that probably fucked you up good.  Just sexual thoughts of this person that they were insisting was your sister.  Yeah, yeah.  But the sexual thoughts wouldn't go away because in your brain, you know she's not your sister. 
[00:50:00]  Right.  I don't know.  She moved in when she was like 15.  She said, there's no way.  But we had to find a K to put her in the cement.  You did?  Yeah.  All our fucking initials are in the cement.  And they said, nope, we have to put the K in there.  And she still came home with cigarettes and took off.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Big red bush.  She'd open up her window so she could sneak a smoke.  Oh, my goodness.  That does sound erotic.  It was nice.  I think she was into the Allman Brothers.  It was like, yeah, she was a hippie girl, man.  You think she had a gentleman from her class sneaking up that window? 
[00:50:30]  No, that was my other sister.  My real sister.  Yeah, she had a boyfriend live in the attic.  I've told all these stories.  Yeah, but that's not erotic because that's your real sister.  Right.  Oh, it goes back to the movie you guys saw.  I thought my house was haunted.  I'm going to retell the story for the gals.  And me and my brothers were all young, 12, 11, 10.  We thought our house was haunted because we heard noises in the attic.  It turns out that my sister's boyfriend got kicked out of the house. 
[00:51:00]  And so, logically, she thought it would be cool if he just lived in the attic.  And she would sneak food up there for him.  How long did he live up there for?  I don't know, to be honest with you.  Maybe like a summer, I would guess.  Oh, my God.  That's wild.  Oh, no, it was more than a week.  Mom and Dad.  It was for a while.  I heard a ghost yelling, I'm going to come.  Open your mouth.  And then I thought it was so cool.  My sister, she's technically my half-sister from my dad's first marriage, technically. 
[00:51:30]  So she was a bit older.  She was six, six and a half years older than me.  And I started asking questions, and she let me in on the secret, which I thought was the coolest thing ever.  She goes, all right, I've got to show you something.  I'm like, what?  And we went up to the attic, and there's the guy going, hi.  Hi.  Just living in your attic.  I'm the ghost.  Oh, he had it all fucking figured out.  He had a nice little fucking spread up there.  Your parents never know?  No.  They never went up to the attic?  He plugged in a little electricity that he turned on. 
[00:52:00]  A little light sucking up your electric bill.  And then he had a little, like, cot slash bed thing.  The weirdness of your childhood, like, even the stuff that you thought was just regular, typical childhood stuff, was weird.  Yeah.  That's why I want to write a book.  I don't want to write a book about radio.  I want to write a book about growing up.  Because when I get with my brothers, the stories we remember together is like, holy fuck, I forgot about that.  This didn't happen to people. 
[00:52:30]  No.  No.  That was a crazy time.  It made it fun, though.  How did they get in and out of the house?  There was a back door that led to the attic.  It was perfect.  Oh.  It was perfect.  It was a secret passage.  Oh, yeah.  Right up to the fucking attic.  It's insane.  Creepy old attic.  I can't fathom.  With windows, though.  Is there a ladder?  That's where all this haunting shit comes from, by the way.  You know, you're just not in on the fucking...  Yeah.  On the guy living in your attic.  Right.  So anyone else coming and going would go, holy fuck, this house is haunted.  Because it was an old house to begin with, so you would hear the creaking. 
[00:53:00]  I think very few people have mystery people living in their houses for seasons.  For an entire summer.  I don't think that happens very often.  I think there are more cases of actual ghosts haunting houses than people living there for a full summer.  Well, then we brought in the colored girl.  Well, my grandma called her the colored girl because she came from a different generation.  It wasn't racist.  She just didn't know any better.  Right.  The worst nickname she could have had, let's be honest.  Yeah.  And it would piss off my mom because my grandma was living with us for a while, too. 
[00:53:30]  And we had a colored girl renting a room where I think we might have just...  Did we...  Oh, no.  That was the summer where we took in a fresh-haired kid.  From the city.  What?  I don't remember all the stories.  Were these just random kids?  Are you new on them?  Well, my town's very, like, Catholic.  I was brought up pretty religious.  And, like, it was the thing to do was to, you know, kind of have a black kid around for a little while for the summer.  That was the... 
[00:54:00]  So they can leave the city and enjoy the beaches and stuff.  That was their accessory for the summer.  I think it was called the Fresh Air Farm.  So you're living in, like, the Long Island suburbs.  And, like, the thing that all the Catholics do is bring in some black kid from the city.  And then we went to the big, I think it was Camp Balvernia.  And we had a big retreat there.  And all the white families brought their black kid there to swim in the pool.  Oh, my gosh.  And in a weird way, everyone felt good about themselves, that they were helping the hood.  Of course they did.  Yeah.  And these black kids don't realize they're just being used for social standings. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  And then we'd bring them to, like, the ocean and stuff.  And they would be just amazed how cool the ocean was.  And then they'd leave them.  I don't think that would last long.  I think that was only a couple weeks, maybe.  Everybody had a Gabby Douglas in their family.  Yeah.  Yeah, I can relate to the Gabby Douglas thing.  But my...  My...  Oh, I almost said something really bad.  Go ahead.  Our kid, let's just say, fucking didn't do the gymnastics like she did.  No.  She didn't do much of anything.  What?  That we were impressed with. 
[00:55:00]  Or she probably would have continued...  Or she probably would have continued living with us.  She had no special skills.  Oh, no pizzazz.  No pizzazz.  Your friends come over and say,  Opie, how come your black kid doesn't do any tricks?  What does yours do?  Yeah.  I just remember, as a kid, realizing how weird it was.  We went to Camp Alvernia.  It was some weird religious retreat for the day or the weekend.  And all the white families had their black...  It was bring the black kid to the pool day or something. 
[00:55:30]  That's so weird.  It was so strange to me.  I'm like, what is this?  And it's like everybody feeling good about themselves.  Right.  Thinking they're doing the right thing.  But the racial undertones are just omnipresent.  And then they popped back on a bus.  We never saw them again.  I don't even know the girl's name.  You don't remember?  No.  The color girl.  But it made the town feel good for a summer.  It's racist.  Is it racist?  I think so.  Why?  Because you're just kind of finding a random black kid and using them. 
[00:56:00]  Like you're trying to show them a good time to make yourself feel better.  Like, look what I did for this person.  It's less than me.  That's sort of what I felt that summer.  Yeah.  It was a little strange.  Yeah.  I mean, it's like taking in a striped hat.  Because you would call up other families like, you got one?  We got one.  Why don't we all get together?  Play date?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like a play date.  Because I don't know what to do with these people.  Maybe if we get them all together, they'll play amongst themselves.  Does yours eat its vegetables?  No.  Mine either. 
[00:56:30]  They meant well, though.  They did.  Their heart was in the right place.  No.  Well, then my parents started renting rooms and my grandmas were living with us.  As we left the house, there was a lot of empty rooms.  So my mom, who was always obsessed with money, thinking she was going to be on the street any day,  started renting rooms to crazy fucking people.  And the, quote, colored woman wasn't a crazy person.  She was very normal.  But my mom came home one day.  My grandma goes, the colored girl came downstairs. 
[00:57:00]  She needs to ask you something.  And my mom really pissed off.  Goes, her name is, and I forgot what her name was.  Right.  Don't say that.  That's your actual grandma.  Yeah.  And she wasn't racist at all.  But she, I mean, if she was alive, she'd be 100 and, how old would she be now?  103.  The era.  It was the era.  Yeah.  It's not some old lady that just moved in and then you're like, no, this is your grandma now.  No, no.  We knew her pretty well.  No, it was not the half-day grandma.  No.  Okay.  But really quickly.  She didn't have red hair.  But I felt bad for my younger brothers. 
[00:57:30]  I got, you know, twin brothers that were, are six years younger than me.  So they were still in the house when they started renting rooms.  So they had to deal with these crazy people.  And my brother, Quinn, befriended one of the guys.  Normal white guy.  Seemed normal on the outside.  And he started stealing everyone's shit, including Quinn's bike, to go get drugs.  Oh, my God.  Which was a bummer for Quinn because he thought he had a real friendship with the guy.  And a bike.  And a bike.  And then there was the girl that OD'd in the woods.  She was, she was, she was dead. 
[00:58:00]  And they brought her back to life.  She was renting a room.  She was living with you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who brought her back to life?  So you guys just rented rooms to drug addicts.  Well, my dad had a good heart.  Yeah.  But he believed in people.  Yeah.  That was one of his faults.  He believed in people for real.  He, he brought in Vietnam vets.  So, you know.  Didn't you say there was something about the spoons too?  Oh, yeah.  Well, there was another guy that would cook up his crack with the spoons I used to eat cereal with. 
[00:58:30]  See, that's a true story.  So you go down for cereal in the morning.  No, see, I was sort of gone.  Okay.  But I was, I was coming and going.  So I got a glimpse of it.  But my brothers actually lived through this period.  But you'd come back to the house.  And I would go, hey, it's good to see everybody.  And I'd go for a spoon.  And I'm like, mom, why the fuck is the spoons burnt?  There's scorch marks on the bottom of the spoons.  And she had no idea that that's because the guy upstairs was cooking up his drugs.  In my old room, by the way.  And then I'd go up there and there'd be burn marks on the rug and stuff. 
[00:59:00]  I'm like, I used to fucking, this is where I fucking had dreams.  Yeah.  That's it for my childhood.  Right.  That's why all you have left is driving past a drive-in movie.  Holy fuck.  And a fake sister.  Yeah.  And a fake sister.  So that guy was cooking up crack.  And then we had the girl that OD'd in the woods.  I think my brother saved her life.  I would have to ask Brett.  I think Brett was the one that knew something was amiss and went up into the woods and saw  her pretty much dead.  So you escaped a lot of it.  Huh?  You escaped a lot of it.  It seemed like it only got weirder after you left.  Yeah.  I knew that 18 would be a good year for me because I could fucking move on and do my thing. 
[00:59:30]  Well, you figure you make your fake sister and get out of there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And then, you know, it continued up until the last tenant that my parents had in the  house.  Mm-hmm.  I told a story and it did make the paper, if you don't believe me.  So we had a tenant that my dad believed in.  I think this was...  He believed in him.  I'm trying to remember if this was after my dad died.  It was right around when my dad died, within a year. 
[01:00:00]  He left a suicide note.  No.  In the house.  And he decided to park his car at the Green Lawn train station, collect us up, and fucking  good night.  And your family's the one that has to deal with that.  Also, my mom...  I think it was only my mom living in the house.  And the cops showed up knocking.  Do you know so-and-so?  Yeah.  Well, he killed himself today at the Green Lawn train station. 
[01:00:30]  He parked in front of a train?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he wanted out.  And then the cops went up into his room that he was renting, and there was the suicide  note.  And then we had to deal with this family that had to come down and get all his shit and  stuff.  He was in our house for years, this guy.  And how come his family...  For years.  Where was his family before?  I don't know.  And he couldn't live with them?  He really didn't have family come around.  Yeah.  He had issues.  But my dad believed in him.  Your dad is just...  Was it a big house?  He was a good-natured man. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  You thought it was a one-bedroom apartment?  We got a sofa.  Nobody sits on the sofa.  We can rent this out.  Let's see.  One, two, three, four...  Cots still in the attic.  Six rooms.  Oh.  So, you know, but I'm one of seven slash eight slash maybe nine.  And when we left, they were empty rooms.  So, yeah, they started renting them out to get some pocket money.  I think that's most of the stories from the tenants, I think. 
[01:01:30]  I think I'm missing out on a couple.  I have to ask my brother.  Did you think your parents needed the money, or was it your mom's, like...  Lonely, empty nest.  Or your mom just being crazy, going, like, oh, I just...  We need to make sure that we have something we need.  Yeah, she was obsessed about money her whole life.  She's obsessing about it right now somewhere.  My parents rented out a room, but it's just, like, to some dude named Dave.  Like, he's not...  Dave's a good guy?  Yeah, he won't park in front of a train or anything.  You know what?  Yeah, we didn't...  I didn't think this guy would ever...  Check your spoons.  Right.  He's, like, his own shelf in the fridge. 
[01:02:00]  It's cool.  Ew, really?  Fuck that.  Oh, you gotta have Dave putting his fucking egg salad sandwich by your shit?  You know how much I would hate?  If I came back from college, and there was a Dave in my house...  It's a paper bed.  Especially if you sensed that your father was submissive to him, and then he was fucking...  And then he was fucking banging your mom.  I'd go from there to there.  Yeah.  That was a weird transition.  Yeah.  But it makes sense.  I just remembered another one.  Brett tells a really good story. 
[01:02:30]  We had another guy that was ridiculously paranoid, thought the government was watching him, and  thought Brett was some kind of secret agent.  But your dad believed him.  Dad believed in this guy, too.  I forgot about this.  And Brett had to constantly convince the guy that he's actually the son of my father, who  was still living in the house.  And the reason he went over there was to visit, and he wasn't, you know, spying on him.  Okay?  And Brett tells a story that he would do a lot of the fixing up around the house, because 
[01:03:00]  my dad got older.  And my brother was in the attic above this guy's room, this paranoid guy.  And I'll just shorten the story, because he makes it way better.  There's so much more to it.  But somehow, he put his foot on the sheetrock, and his foot went through, through the fucking  ceiling, sort of near the closet.  He looks into the hole to see the paranoid guy looking up at him, like, really?  You're not spying on me? 
[01:03:30]  And Brett was never able to explain, look, I was just trying to fix something in the attic,  and my foot went through the sheetrock.  I would have seemed like I was a secret agent, like, send, like, secret facts and stuff  to myself.  Yeah, all right, well, yeah.  Like, play and do it.  What?  Like, I would have just made him think I was an agent.  Oh, God.  Made him believe it.  That is unbelievable.  You don't need that in your home, though.  That's something you fuck with people, but you don't fuck with somebody who lives in  your house who's psychotic.  Then they turn it on you.  Yeah.  They invited problems into our house. 
[01:04:00]  It was crazy.  Because your dad believed in him.  Yeah, I'm going to...  I'll write my brothers today and see if I'm missing out on some of the tenants.  That'll be one chapter in the fucking book.  That's like eight chapters right there.  You have a ten.  Yeah.  Each chapter.  All right.  The colored girl chapter.  Yeah.  That was just a quick one.  I don't know her name.  She didn't even talk.  She just went, dude, da-dude, da-dude.  She was sasset.  I liked her. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah?  She was all right.  Yeah.  I think my dad liked her, too.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  I saw her in his eye.  She'd probably spank his ass a little when she walked by.  No one was looking.  She could have his ass a little swat.  I think my dad might have had a little thing.  Not an actual thing, but you know.  Maybe a little thing.  I think he might have been daydreaming a little bit when she walked by.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Just thinking about that sweet chocolate syrup.  Oh, yeah.  Shaking her fucking black hiney around the house.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  All the Hughes men are entranced by the jiggling black hiney.  She knew what she was doing, walking up those stairs, swiveling the hips.  She had some juice.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  She had a little thickness.  Well, I got brother-in-laws.  We go to the black mall down there in Philly just to look at the juice.  Sure.  You got to.  We make a whole thing out of it.  He calls me up when I'm down there.  He's like, you want to go look at some juice?  He calls it juice.  I go, yeah, let's go look at some juice.  And then we just walk around the mall looking at black hinders. 
[01:05:30]  Nice.  True.  True story.  I like that.  Yeah.  It's a nice bonding time.  Yeah.  God, you'll say anything when Anthony's not here.  Got to fill up the time, so I might as well tell this shit.  Anyway.  You couldn't actually tell that story when Anthony was here.  He would object vehemently to it.  He would be so disappointed.  He would be so bummed out.  Yeah.  And yes, the Convary was very good.  I recommend it.  It was very frightening.  Well, what we're going to play into break, yesterday we were looking at the trailer 
[01:06:00]  that started this whole phenomenon, the Conjuring phenomenon that led to Jimmy and the interns  going to the screening yesterday.  We were just watching the trailer, and people thought this was hilarious, how we were losing  our minds.  So I think we'll replay it into break.  Girok.  Sure.  I want to thank the interns.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Maybe we'll have you back in.  We'll see.  We'll see how it goes.  Throughout that break, Dennis Falcone wanted to come in here and tell a drive-in story.  And I fucking gave him the old, see you later, buddy.  Well, what was the drive-in story you wanted to see? 
[01:06:30]  I just wanted to say that.  You know, I think it's so, I think we should save it for after the break.  It's so good.  Once we've moved on.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  No, I think Dennis Falcone needs to tell his drive-in story after the break.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  I remember.  I would go to the drive-in and people would behave.  We need to make sure we clear the field for Denny.  And that it's obvious why you've never been on a radio full-time voice.  Yeah.  You know what he told me?  It's lacking.  It's lacking a little something. 
[01:07:00]  It's depressing.  What?  He told me, because, you know, he's heard us say that before, and he kind of, he knows  that his voice is, he just doesn't have a strong voice.  But he said it's all he's ever wanted, is to have a radio voice.  And he says to this day, he's in the car.  When he drives anywhere, he's talking up every song.  He practices his boss jock voice daily.  Yeah, that's like me fucking practicing my jumper.  It's not going to happen.  Accept it.  You have your own voice.  Be your own voice.  You don't need a big radio voice. 
[01:07:30]  Now this is way too inside, but fuck it.  When I was living in Buffalo doing radio, I still came from, you know, the old days of  radio where it mattered if you had a good voice.  And then people said, fuck it, including myself, and said, look, just get stupid on the radio  and hopefully it'll work, because you don't have the actual radio voice.  Had a horrible Long Island accent.  But I worked with a guy up in Buffalo.  His name was, I think it was Garth Hemp.  You could look him up.  And he would smoke cigarettes without filters, and he would drink bourbon. 
[01:08:00]  And the sole reason was to fuck up his voice, get it all deep and scratchy, like mine is  today, because I got a, you know, a throat thing happening.  He would purposely do that.  It's great.  Garth Hemp wants to give up his fucking lungs and liver.  And I wonder if he had a fucking backsell a shitty song.  Yeah, that's him, all right.  He's going by his real name now, Garth Kemp.  Let me see him.  Oh, it is Kemp.  No, it says on a message board that he did.  He used to call himself Garth Hemp.  Oh, okay.  Because it's cooler.  Because it's cooler.  Yeah, Hemp.  Oh, I get it.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Doobies.  He did not belong in Buffalo at the time.  He's got to be in L.A. or something, right?  He's on...  He was kind of an L.A., West Coast type of guy that...  Yeah.  He's on ABC7 in L.A.  That's a great job.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  He did all right.  He came into Buffalo to do mornings, and he would...  That was the tip he gave me.  I was just a young kid.  He's like, yeah, you should start drinking bourbon and smoke cigarettes without filters  to get a voice like mine.  And he did have the voice. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Do you have any clips of him?  And he was the one that coined the phrase Buffalo Betty.  Really?  Yeah, that I love to this day.  I love calling Buffalo girls Buffalo Bettys.  And what that meant, back then, you had no clue if a girl had a nice body, because up  in the Buffalo area, in those horrible winters, they just would wear these oversized Buffalo  Bills sweatshirts.  I have a couple.  He's the weatherman.  He's the weather guy.  Yeah.  Let me hear Garth... 
[01:09:30]  Earlier in the day, big, big delays happening that were going on in the Dallas.  Yeah, man.  ...about a three-hour delay through Dallas, Texas, due to heavy weather moving through  that area.  But for the West Coast, things look real nice.  It's all bourbon and unfiltered cigarettes, huh?  Does he have the voice, or what?  Yeah.  Christmas Eve tonight...  I don't know what Denny wouldn't do for that voice.  He doesn't drink bourbon.  He's the 90's how to get it, though.  Yeah.  Costa Mace and Clayton 7.  And not too late.  He would tell all the young guys like myself, you know, he would try to turn us on to cancer.  Yeah.  That was his whole tip. 
[01:10:00]  And alcoholism, yeah.  Because when you're coming up...  Cirrhosis of the liver and cancer.  Yeah, when you were coming up, you'd try to get some tips from the older guys, and that  was his.  Then I heard Brother Weez, and then I was like, all right, I don't need the fucking cigarettes  and the bourbon.  Just be stupid.  People will enjoy us.  Not that Brother Weez is stupid.  No, his waist is just...  Horrible.  Oh, my God.  Brother Weez has the worst voice in radio, and he's a hero to me.  Because he just fucking...  He is.  He's just himself on the radio.  He's just kick-ass. 
[01:10:30]  All right.  We're babbling now.  We've got to clear the field for Denny's big drive-in story.  Yeah, it's going to be a fucking gem.  Some innocence that happened.  And I remember one time we would bring a punch that had a little bit of liquor in it.  Well, no, Jim.  We wouldn't do that.  Really?  You want to get your ass eaten?  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oof.  Boo.  Boo.  Good-natured story. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  I have a good-ass-eating story.  Maybe later, though, Sam.  Stay in front of Denny.  Not in front of the ladies.  Let's watch him.  Why?  They ain't gonna handle it.  Not in front of the interns.  They're radio people now.  They get it.  Yeah.  Oh, and the Ultimate Warrior says hello.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I saw that you tweeted that.  I interviewed him yesterday.  Did you fucking bring audio to the show, or did you ask ONA questions?  No, I didn't ask ONA questions.  Why?  We want him on the show badly.  I know.  He remembered when I was calling him, because we got his phone number, and I was leaving 
[01:11:30]  him voicemails trying to get him on the show.  Right.  And he goes, I remember you guys.  I said, oh, I'm not gonna do Opie and Anthony.  Those guys will tear me apart.  But he's a brave guy.  Not that brave.  He comes across as a tough guy.  He can handle us, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're on his side, too, in the whole Hulk Hogan fight.  Although he's the only one fighting that fight, isn't he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, yeah, he says, I mean, you can, I got the interview, but it's wrestling questions.  Nah. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, what'd you ask him?  I can tell you, Chip.  Where do they go for the interview, though?  You should get a nice little plug-in.  Not Sam on YouTube.  Okay.  If you want to hear The Ultimate Warrior.  You should ask one question that we could have played on our show.  You could play it on your show.  No, people don't really like wrestling.  I don't know.  I got like 13,000 hits in 12 hours.  That's one guy.  Did you really?  Really obsessed.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  Well, you ought to fucking run the SiriusXM site.  Yeah.  Killing them. 
[01:12:30]  Wait, 13,000 in one day?  In 12 hours.  Oh, no.  That means it's way higher.  You know how that works, right?  No, that's not a real number.  Sick.  It's probably well over 20, that means.  Nice.  I'm serious.  You watch that counter jump up today.  My Colin Quinn video got 1,600.  Ooh.  That's a lot.  Why?  Because, you know.  He's a big star.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to play us looking at the Conjuring trailer yesterday.  People thought this was funny. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, it was funny.  So hopefully it is.  We'll replay it here.  Danny's going to come back and tell us his drive-in story.  Yeah.  I know the story.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He got his pekka stuck in the fucking cigarette lighter.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Jeff Bridges comes in at 815 today as well.  So hit it.  You rock.  You want to see this Conjuring thing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is from the scary part.  Oh, it's the Conjuring? 
[01:13:30]  That's an awful habit.  It's a true story from the 70s about two people that are like paranormal witch hunter type  people that go into houses and stuff like that.  Look how nice.  Like they wash the color out and everything.  Yeah.  It just looks scary.  Right.  It's a true story and it's horrifying, they say.  Let me see it, Sam.  I'll kiss you.  The Conjuring.  Don't kiss me.  Brad.  What is it?  Ah!  Fuck you, you cocksucker!  Stop.  Jesus Christ!  It takes a toll on her. 
[01:14:00]  A little peace each time.  Oh my God.  You have a lot of spirits in here, but there's the one that I'm most worried about because  it is so hateful.  It's me.  What would she hate me too?  Creepy kid.  Ah, son of a mother fucker!  It's not here.  It's not at all.  Why would you give yourself to this?  This thing has latched itself to your family.  I know, I've never seen nothing like this. 
[01:14:30]  You hate this?  I don't like this.  I'm coming with you.  No, I can't lose you.  There's a lady in a dirty nightgown that I see in my dreams.  She's standing in front of my mom's bed.  Hello.  Do you want to see him?  Yeah.  When the music stops, you'll see him in the mirror standing behind you.  Look what she made me do. 
[01:15:00]  Oh my God.  Jesus!  No!  I don't like this!  Oh my God!  I hate this shit!  Oh my God!  I don't like it!  I hate this!  I just have a little screen.  I see you.  My arm handle is standing up.  Yeah, no, I got the...  That was so scary.  That was so scary.  This is really scary.  Well, duh!  My arm handle.  Your reactions were grown men. 
[01:15:30]  The whole show should go.  I'm a father of two for Christ's sake.  Kenny has to go.  I guess I have a screening for all of us after the show.  Oh, yes.  Someone's saying we've got to see the first trailer for The Conjuring.  Oh man, I already got...  I finally got Wyoming down.  Is there another trailer?  Here's the teaser.  Oh, it's just a teaser.  That was the main trailer.  I'm in my own room.  Oh, really?  You're the young man.  Oh, that's in the room.  What?  Oh, no.  The mic's in the way.  One, two, three, four, nine, ten. 
[01:16:00]  Alright.  Zombies.  First clap.  Nice song.  What could possibly be wrong with this movie?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Just the fun and free 70s.  She's...  Innocence.  Blindfolded, feeling around the room.  Oh, fuck.  The door opened up in the room.  Yeah, it's pretty great.  What the fuck?  I'm gonna get you now.  She's blindfolded.  You're just clapping in the closet. 
[01:16:30]  She's feeling around in the closet as she's blindfolded.  Pulled the blindfold off.  She took your blindfold off.  I win.  I was in Christine and Nancy's room.  Alright.  Alright, nothing happened.  There's nowhere in the closet.  It's very creepy.  And how did somebody clap?  Fucking mirrors in these movies.  God damn it.  I hate mirrors.  Girls, it's way past your bedtime.  Oh, she heard a noise.  Oh, boy.  She's going to investigate.  The girls are asleep.  What's making the noise?  Fuck that. 
[01:17:00]  Fuck, watch.  Oh, man.  She's falling down.  Fell off the wall.  Don't go there.  Don't.  Don't go there.  We don't need you to investigate, ma'am.  Oh, my God.  Why is she doing this? 
[01:17:30]  Don't go down there.  You never go down the basement.  Oh, my God.  Don't ever go down.  Alright.  That's just a lot of things covered up.  Who's ever down there?  I'm going to lock you in now.  Good thinking.  Oh, shit.  A door hit her in the face.  She's down in the basement by herself?  Yes, with the light off.  Oh, she's got a match, though.  That's cool.  Is she alone?  Yeah.  But the match can't see too far.  But she's going to try anyway. 
[01:18:00]  This bitch is going to burn her finger.  Oh, my God.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  We've got to set up a screen.  Get the fuck out of here.  No.  No.  Get the fuck out of here.  No.  I don't like that.  You guys got to go.  You guys would be way worse than a gym at these screenings.  We're shot jocks, Sam Roberts.  I can't.  Fuck that.  With the fucking hair on my arms and around my soft penis is standing up. 
[01:18:30]  That was so fucking scary.  Fuck that.  If we set up a screening for tomorrow or Wednesday, can you two commit to it?  Fuck that.  Dude.  That's that shit.  They fucking do it right.  When you get people that can make a movie like that and do it right like that, it's so funny.  You don't know where it's coming from.  You spend the whole movie going, ah, because you don't know.  Yeah.  Oh, is that scary?  I think there's some downtime where it's just some nice dialogue. 
[01:19:00]  But then you don't know of like the next second, so you can't ever.  Is there another great groovy 60s song in there?  That's like paranormal activity when there's just conversations going on in the kitchen and you're just sitting there waiting for all the kitchen drawers to open.  And you know it's coming.  You're not even listening to the conversation.  You're just looking around like, all right, where's it coming from?  Yes.  See, the thing, the funny part is like, they'll cut.  All right, we got to redo that. 
[01:19:30]  There was a problem with the match.  So whoever's hands they were, it's like, I'm going to run to craft services and grab a fucking, I'm going to grab a turkey sandwich with the clapping in the dark hands.  Those hands were holding, were wiping an asshole an hour before.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony. 
[01:20:00]  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. continues.  Remember how we listened to the radio?  And I said, that's the place to be.  And how I got the job as an FM jock the day you married me.  It was two kids and I was into AM rock, but I just had to run around.  You know this one.  Fucking phenomenal.  W.O.L.D. by Harry Cainter.  I love it.  I forgot you're a big Harry fan.  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  I am the morning DJ.  Oh yeah, I know this.  Sure.  He's a genius, this guy.  He's great.  Is this Denny's walk-on music?  He wishes he was the morning DJ.  This should be a walk-on music.  Let's make this his walk-on music.  Remember when we used to do walk-on music for everybody?  Yeah, we should do that again.  Yeah.  This is Denny's song.  This is his dream right here.  Yeah, this is about his legendary DJ that Denny never was. 
[01:21:00]  That Denny never was.  I feel bad for that.  No, this is about a DJ who just kind of does these little gigs locally and he winds up in  these shitty places and then he gets cut because we're just drinking and he comes back and  his fucking ex-wife is hooked up with someone else.  Great.  It's a great song, huh?  Yeah.  Good storyteller, this Harry Chapin.  Brilliant, man.  Don't want to go out on a limb or anything, but I think he was a good storyteller.  I've watched this Sessions thing he did where he sang all this stuff live in front of a 
[01:21:30]  small crowd and I don't know if it was BBC or what it was, but it was fucking amazing  to watch him sing live.  He was so good.  I found his stuff kind of depressing.  Yeah, that's why I like it.  You like that, huh?  Yeah, he captures that weird, that sadness and that loneliness, but he captures it well,  not in a cheesy way.  And you like going down to that level?  I love it.  With music sometimes?  If it feels genuine, if it feels real, like if he tells a good story, which he does.  I should listen to more of his stuff. 
[01:22:00]  Like you feel for this guy, this fucking lonely radio guy, like you see this guy's story and  it's just shitty.  I saw a lot of those guys over the years.  Yeah.  And you do feel bad.  Oh my God, dude.  Every radio guy in the country who's heard this person loved this song.  Yeah.  Because they had way more passion for what they were doing than the people they worked  for.  Always.  Always.  Bouncing around the country.  Right.  You know, it brings up what I was doing last night.  I saw the Johnny Carson documentary, Thanks to Anthony, on Netflix. 
[01:22:30]  Fuck, it was good, man.  And Johnny Carson's talking about the same shit we talk about today, meaning he was frustrated  by the network because they were fucking around with his material and he had to bump heads  with the executives and he thought that was just complete nonsense that they should just  let him do his fucking thing.  And I'm like, wow, even Johnny Carson had to deal with that shit?  Was that what that was?  Well, on a much lower level, obviously.  But then you see a guy like Carson had to deal with it. 
[01:23:00]  And they show his mother, right?  That's the one that hit the interviewer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What a, I don't like saying the words, Sam, but Johnny Carson's mom was good.  Oh my.  I'll say it like that.  Makes it easier.  She was brutal.  Yeah.  She fucking, Johnny Carson was at the, you know, top of his career basically.  And I think it was, I think they said it was Time Magazine.  Sat down with Johnny Carson's mom to do this article.  I guess it was on Johnny Carson, but they went down there. 
[01:23:30]  I think she was still in Nebraska.  And she watched Johnny Carson's monologue in front of a Time, I think it was Time Magazine  reporter.  And, and after it was over, she got up and said, oh, that wasn't very funny.  Just a fucking narcissist.  What the fuck?  Awful bitch.  Awful.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Just hateable.  A hateable narcissist woman.  There's enough people out there that'll, that'll hate you.  But coming from your own fucking family and friends, what the fuck?  In front of that reporter. 
[01:24:00]  And maybe if that was her true, you know, thought on the thing, you don't blow up your,  your son's spot.  Nah, she sucked.  His mother sucked.  But then it was kind of interesting because, um, interesting.  Uh, when she died, I guess they found a box in her, uh, in her house that was filled with  all of Johnny Carson's press copies and stuff.  Every single, you know, magazine he was in.  Oh, she saved it.  She saved everything.  And that, they hinted that that made Johnny feel a lot better about the, you know, the 
[01:24:30]  relationship he had with her.  Wow.  In, in a way like, oh, see, she really did, you know, care and, and was, you know, and  was happy and had pride and all that.  And then supposedly Johnny Carson kept that box in his closet right up until he died.  I would love to, uh, it's interesting.  You don't hear about Johnny Carson giving a shit about anybody.  So, you know, the fact that somebody was kind of, kind of had his number, I guess that  was his mother was the one for him.  Everyone's got that one person.  Uh, documentary was, it was, it was terrific. 
[01:25:00]  And then he's, then he's explaining the joke and he basically says the same shit we've  heard a million times on our show where, you know, you break, you break down a joke and  really get into it.  You're offending someone every single fucking time.  Yeah.  You know, the same shit that we're dealing with today.  He, he got it, obviously.  I mean, he was, he was the king.  I want to see that again.  Deservingly so.  I want to see that again.  That was a great special, a great documentary.  His example was divorce.  You, you, you know, you tell a joke about divorce or, you know, but you could do it with 
[01:25:30]  any other topic that's going on today.  And he's like, you break it down, man.  You know, divorce is not a, a good topic.  You know, people are hurt, you know, there's alcoholism, there's cheating, there's kids  that are hurt, but you know, but the joke itself is funny.  Yeah.  Period.  Denny.  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  This is your walk-on music.  You like this one, right?  Yeah.  Matter of fact, Harry died on the L.I.E. on his way to a concert.  Yeah, I know.  He ate the fucking steering wheel.  We all know. 
[01:26:00]  We decided not to mention that part of the legacy.  Oh, okay.  Where he burned alive on the L.I.E.  We all know.  I didn't get into it that deep as you did.  I just said he lost his life.  I think he had a tanker truck who was not pretty.  On his way to a concert, huh?  Yeah.  What exit?  I don't know.  What exit?  But it was on the L.I.E.  You should know that, Denny.  I don't remember.  You should know what exit, Denny.  He was heading west to Eisenhower Park for a concert.  But you should go real local and go, you know, you know that exit that we've all passed a million  times that happened right there.  We don't have to be as local. 
[01:26:30]  No, we're national.  You're not.  We're multinational.  You're national sometimes.  I work for the same company as you do.  You're national sometimes.  I work for the same company.  Somebody's sick.  What?  Somebody's sick.  We love you, Denny.  I know you do.  You need the big break.  Yes.  I'm happy.  Even though your voice is a little soft.  Even though your voice is a little soft.  Of course it is, yeah.  I worked with a guy once who...  Could you relate to the Garth Hemp story I told?  The old school guy?  Yeah, I did.  I worked with a guy by the name of Dave Wiener. 
[01:27:00]  I'll never forget.  He was a newsman.  And this guy would smoke like...  Because you remember back in the day, you could smoke in the radio station.  Right.  And he always had a cigarette.  And the reason was because he was working on his voice.  I wanted to get a deep voice.  And he would always smoke.  Right.  And just...  You know, I smoked back then.  It didn't help.  Oh, you tried it now.  No, I just smoked before that.  He did...  He went to Florida.  He was down in Florida.  I don't know if he's still in the business.  Maybe died of cancer.  I don't know.  But he smoked like crazy, this guy.  Because you could smoke in a radio station back then.  Right. 
[01:27:30]  And, you know, I mean...  Look, I remember working with this other guy.  He was a Jehovah's Witness.  And the story is, is the way I found out about it is we were doing a Mother's Day thing.  You're hurting your voice right now.  And I said, John...  Well, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'll tell you...  Hold on.  We're going to get to your story.  But you're hurting your voice.  I'm not hurting my voice.  I'm just talking.  You're your regular voice.  I'm just talking.  Because you're really trying to...  No, I'm not.  You're really working the vocal cords.  No, no.  I'm just speaking regularly.  And the thing is...  Sam, it's me.  No.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm just speaking...  I'm speaking with my headphones on. 
[01:28:00]  I guess I can hear it.  With my headphones on.  You can see the way the muscles are contracting in his throat.  Yes, the muscles are growing.  You're like...  That's why a lot of guys would stand up.  All right.  So you could project a little better.  Speak from the diaphragm.  Wait.  Who is the guy that moved to Florida?  Dave Wiener.  You fucking fell for it.  Fuck yeah.  Big pecker.  Anyway.  All right.  Very immature.  So I told this guy once...  Did he start over?  I would sell my soul to the devil.  No, I'm serious.  I'm serious.  Start over because I forgot.  Forgot what?  The whole story.  The story is the guy was a Jehovah's Witness. 
[01:28:30]  Okay.  And he was very religious.  I didn't know anything about that religion at the time.  And we were doing something on the air.  And I said something about,  Hey, what are you getting your mom for Mother's Day this year?  And he just clipped the mic and walked away.  And I walked in the newsroom.  I said, you know, why did you do that?  And he goes, well, I honor my mother every day.  Because I guess he didn't celebrate holidays or something.  What a jerk off.  He just let me hang in there.  So I said, well, why did you do that?  And, you know, he just said he honored his mom every day.  I said, okay, that's very nice.  And I said, you know what?  I said, one day I said, if the devil walked through the door, 
[01:29:00]  I would sell my soul to the devil for a great radio voice.  You would?  I would.  So, wait.  He was mad at me.  He was yelling at me.  He's an asshole.  But was this on the air?  No.  See, that was the...  You didn't do things like that back then.  You didn't do things like that.  You just didn't.  No, but as soon as you started doing those things,  you went to the top of the fucking, you know.  Well, yeah.  It was a different time.  As soon as you started talking about that stuff,  that's when people started paying attention and went,  oh, fuck, these...  You know, now it's worth listening to these guys. 
[01:29:30]  Well, if you're...  Instead of a dumb weather and traffic break.  But if you're not going to a music station...  Ten seconds on the Doobie Brothers before Black Water starts.  Who cares?  But then you started talking about how much of a dick that guy was.  People wanted to listen to that.  I didn't say that.  He was...  I just, you know, disagreed with him.  He was a dick, Denny.  Dick.  We're on your side.  He left you hanging on the air because he honors his mother every day.  He's a shithead.  Okay.  He was a dick.  You should have kept those mics on.  Yeah, you should say,  why don't you honor your broadcast colleague?  Yeah.  That's right.  He was a self-righteous shithead.  I said, it's part of the show. 
[01:30:00]  Just go along with it.  That's all.  Just say, you know, whatever.  I'm taking him out.  The fact that you had to say that to him should have made you want to spit on him.  Yeah.  That guy sucked.  Yeah.  We're on your side, Denny.  Yeah.  Where's his sense of show business?  Exactly.  I honor my mother every day.  Do ya?  He got mad at that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was...  Because I guess he didn't celebrate the holiday.  How did he honor his mother every day?  I didn't get a dick with her back.  I bet you didn't honor his...  Yeah.  I just walked out.  I guarantee he didn't honor his mother every day.  He wanted to save some money and buy her a gift, I guess.  Which guy is this, by the way? 
[01:30:30]  Was it Dave Wieter?  No, it was Johnny D.  Johnny D.  Johnny D.  There's a lot of Johnny D's out there.  Oh, yeah.  What's he doing?  I don't know.  Hey, this guy knows what exit Harry Chapin died on.  See, we go local here.  What's going on, brother?  Hey, Tony, what's up, buddy?  From Brooklyn, I know you.  Harry Chapin was exit 40 on the LIE.  Okay.  Okay.  Where's exit 40?  Which one is that now?  Help me out.  Jericho Turnpike, around there?  The conch?  No, that's...  Conch is further east. 
[01:31:00]  No, no, no.  He was on the LIE exit 40, right by, you know, where it comes off, 25.  Yeah, right by Jericho Turnpike.  Okay.  And he got hit by some truck.  He was having a heart attack, and he passed away.  I don't know.  And then his wife got like $12 million on the lawsuit from that.  Why?  Wow.  Oh, from the accident itself.  I got you.  Do they mark the spot where Harry Chapin died?  Like the rest of the roadside memorials we all are lucky enough to see as we drive around? 
[01:31:30]  I think that was like 35 years ago.  Although, oh, I live in Huntington, actually.  Nice.  We live parallel lives.  Lived in Buffalo, too.  So, um, my mother and I went, uh, saw his grave and, uh, sang Cats in the Cradle.  Kind of cheesy, but what the hell.  Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You and your mother stood there.  You can't just quickly.  Hold on.  They can do.  Hold on.  Jimmy's got this.  Good.  Jimmy, you can't just...  You and your mother went to see Harry Chapin's grave, and the two of you stood there and sang  Cats in the Cradle?  What can I say?  My mother's 67.  She loved Harry Chapin. 
[01:32:00]  Good for her.  We'll go along.  All I'm thinking of is how great it would be if the sky opened and then fucking an anvil fell on both  of you while you were doing that.  How douchey was that moment, Tony?  You gotta be honest.  It was, uh, very douchey.  Okay.  You know what?  She, uh, you know, something she wanted to do.  I grew up in Buffalo.  I live in Huntington now.  And, uh...  Neither of those things is pertinent to the story as to why you sang Cats in the Cradle  with your mom.  I bet she didn't get through the whole song because she didn't remember the words.  She didn't remember the words, and now it's awkward, and now you're kind of humming 
[01:32:30]  part of it.  Where they were crying.  Right.  Cradle and the silver spoon.  Who was the hair band who did the song?  That was Ugly Kid Joe.  Yep.  Okay.  I would have played that version myself.  I prefer Harry's.  Harry was so good.  Johnny Cash did a great version of this.  Really?  Great cover.  It's faster, it's not sad.  Really?  Why don't we play that, uh, sometime today there? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  You rock.  Our Jeff...  Jeff is...  Danny, thanks for coming in.  Jeff Bridges is on his way up.  Okay.  Godspeed.  We'll go back to you.  Thank you.  Thank you for your time.  All right, Tony.  Great story.  Harry Chapin singing Cats in the Cradle at his grave.  That's, uh...  Yeah.  That's...  It's borderline heinous, that story.  Him and his mom.  Because they didn't know Harry Chapin.  That would be bad if Harry's friends did it.  Mm-hmm.  What?  Is he...  He's coming in now.  Yeah, he's on his way up.  Okay, cool.  And we'll get back to Danny and his, uh... 
[01:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  Drive-in story.  That terrific story.  And I want to make him listen to Garth Kemp's voice.  I want him to critique Garth Kemp's wonderful...  Oh, it's a great voice.  Old-school radio voice now doing weather in L.A.  That story about that guy leaving him hanging is going to annoy me all morning.  Of course.  But, well, you know, the business is filled with those douchebags.  Johnny D.  We worked with all those guys at NAW.  They were all just shitty people toward us.  Because we were trying to do something different.  I can't wait to tell you... 
[01:34:00]  The only one that wasn't shitty was Scott Muni.  I never met him.  And he probably had the right to be shitty to us.  He was an amazing DJ.  Old-school guy.  And he fucking took us under his fucking wing.  Big time.  And the rest of the guys, like, fucking hated us openly.  Not Muni, man.  He would go, hey, come on in.  And invite us into his office and just tell story after story after story about all the guys he met.  He said, yeah, it's time me and John and Yoko were hanging out. 
[01:34:30]  Just showing me, like, fucking pictures and autographs.  He was just lonely.  He was cool.  He liked us a lot.  I wish I would have met him.  He drove out of the garage one day the wrong way.  He had his own rules.  He didn't want to wait to go out the right way.  So he went out the way you fucking come into the garage one lane, one of those tiny lanes that has the big fucking big time curve.  He just went flying up there.  One day he didn't care.  What are you doing, Sam?  He stopped breaking everything.  Everything's okay.  The shit he had in his office, though. 
[01:35:00]  And Pyle's like, oh, let me find this.  And it would be some just Paul McCartney autograph or Paul McCartney signed picture.  Oh, yeah, this was the time me and Paul went for coffee.  Unbelievable.  I don't have any of those memories.  Yeah, you do.  I don't.  We've fucking met.  We've met some people.  Yeah, but I didn't want to have coffee with them.  You've had coffee with Bob Kelly.  You were at Ozzy's house.  You were at Ozzy's house?  You filmed a little thing with Ozzy.  That is true.  I don't have anything from there, though. 
[01:35:30]  By the way, I can't wait.  Jeff Bridges is going to be amazed when he realizes his movie opens on my birthday.  Your birthday's in two days, Jimmy.  Yes.  What are we doing this year?  Oh, please.  The surprise bash hasn't been planned.  Thank you.  I don't even know if you're going to be here for your birthday.  I will be on a plane.  I'm on a plane.  Flying home Thursday night.  I'm doing a Jay Leno segment.  And I'll be getting off the plane and the red line coming right here. 
[01:36:00]  So I'll be tired on my birthday.  You'll be tuckered out.  Yes, I will.  I'll be very loopy.  Why do you keep checking the headphones?  What's wrong with you?  Are you an OCD?  Well, I was going to ask you something, but I don't know.  What?  Is it even worth it to get you a cake since you're so svelte and taking care of yourself now?  Probably not, but I'll ask you after Jeff Bridges.  Jeff Bridges walking into our studio.  Terrible timing for that awful question.  Mr. Bridges, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show, sir.  How is it?  Yeah, please.  Holy mackerel.  We're on the air. 
[01:36:30]  It's a pleasure to see you.  You all right?  Good morning.  Wow.  We're all right if you want.  Wow, you're actually here.  Yes.  Here I am.  I'm used to seeing you on the big screen.  It's rare we get a lot of the A-listers to do morning radio.  Oh, don't say that.  No, no, no, but they don't like doing it.  We get a lot of A-listers, Mr. Bridges.  Good, good.  Do you like morning radio or do you not like it?  I'm doing pretty good right this second.  You know, I'm a little sleepy.  I'm looking forward to my coffee.  It should be here soon. 
[01:37:00]  Any second.  Keep the speed.  Right.  You played one of my favorite roles.  You can't hear?  Just down, just a skosh.  Yeah, you got your...  I imagine it's a little.  Hold on.  We're probably blowing out Mr. Bridges' ears right now.  Is it right here?  Yeah.  You got it?  Yeah, cool.  Thank you.  I almost told him left to turn it down, right to turn it up, but I'm assuming he knows how  to do that.  My mother is in love with you, before we get into the interview.  In love with you.  Cool, man.  Yeah.  She's an older broad, but she... 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, that's all right.  I like older broads.  Yeah.  She was in love with Jeff Bridges.  We talk about Mr. Bridges all the time.  Jeff, Jeff's a very handsome guy.  He played, you know, you were playing King Kong.  Let's be honest.  I'm not a woman, but back in those days, I would have hooked up with you if it was possible.  Where did they shoot that?  That was one of the scenes that stuck with me.  Oh, man.  Where you're standing on the outside of the tower, and Jessica Lange and the ape on the  other...  Oh, yeah.  And that was a horrifying moment to me.  You know, it was a wild thing during that, when we were shooting that. 
[01:38:00]  This little guy comes up to me, and he says, how do you like my temple?  I say, your temple?  He says, yes, this is my temple.  I say, what are you talking about?  He says, oh, yes, I tightroped across, and Philippe Petit...  Oh, no kidding.  And he lived right across the street from that, and he would look up at that thing every day.  You know, this was his...  We're obsessed with Philippe Petit and what he did that day.  Man, wasn't that amazing?  We talk about it all the time.  And then he was sentenced to what? 
[01:38:30]  To perform for free in the park for a year or something.  And that was the year we were making Kong, and that was wild.  He taught me how to juggle, which I think...  The thing about that day, now they figure all that stuff out, and they test everything.  He just...  He snuck in.  And then he...  You saw the documentary, right?  Oh, yeah.  Where he shot the arrow to get the line across, and then that was...  Can you imagine?  He didn't know if it was all going to be, you know, secure enough.  And he was planning that for years. 
[01:39:00]  Right.  And all his friends, you know, were laughing at it and say, yeah, we're with you.  And they all fell out, except for his best friend who went over to the other side.  It was just him and us...  God, what a story.  And he laid down on the wire between the towers, and that's what freaks me and Jimmy out.  He said he saw planes flying above him.  Not just walking, but he did a 45-minute show.  So he's been here and talked to you guys.  Yeah, a few years back, we talked to him.  And then we just had Nick Walenda a couple weeks ago, who did the Grand Canyon thing.  Oh, wow.  There's something about the towers, though.  There's something about the way he had to rig that and sneak in that makes that so impressive. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, God, amazing.  Did it annoy you a little bit, though, that you guys were doing this movie, and he had  to come over and just go, hey?  I walked between those two buildings.  Yeah, did it bug you a little bit, that he had to come and get a little, you know, kind  of...  Why would that bug me?  I don't know, because if he's kind of coming over and getting, you know...  No, actually, you know what his connection was?  He used to perform with Jessica Lange.  Yeah.  In France.  She was kind of a street performer.  So he knew her?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  There you go. 
[01:40:00]  Did she remember him?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they're buds, yeah.  Did you like the remake?  I mean, it's always weird if you...  I mean, even though your version was a remake, of course.  Oh, yeah, but our version was kind of a joke.  I mean, you know, you had this guy, you know, Rick Baker in the suit, you know, and then  they would cut to this, you know, 90-foot-tall, you know, statue of an ape, and it was ridiculous.  No, I thought the new thing was, the new one was, you know, kind of spectacular.  The ape was incredible.  You know what freaked me out about what I didn't like about the 77 version? 
[01:40:30]  It had nothing to do with you or the acting.  It was that in the movie poster, because I was like nine at the time, in the movie poster,  they show Kong straddling both buildings, holding planes, and you're like, he's fucking huge.  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.  But in the movie, he didn't do that.  No, no.  He had to jump from one building to the other.  I was very, I felt very gypped.  I remember as a kid, you know, pretending to be sick so I could stay home and watch the  original.  I used to love that thing.  The original Kong?  The original Kong.  Oh, yeah, that was, that was great.  What made you get into acting? 
[01:41:00]  I guess Bo got into it first, and of course your father.  Oh, my dad.  I mean, he, he wanted all of his kids to get into showbiz.  He just loved it.  It was kind of unusual for an actor, you know, but he, he really dug it, you know, wanted  us all to go into it.  He was great at it, too.  That's just the opposite, right?  Not that I need to tell you that.  Yeah, you hear a lot from, you know, guys like yourself that, oh, I don't want my kids  to go into this business.  It's too crazy.  Yeah, yeah, but he dug it, man.  Oh, he, he said, you gotta do it. 
[01:41:30]  I, I wanted, you know, for a long time, I wanted to, I said, well, I don't know, dad,  you know, I'm thinking music, you know, maybe.  And he says, no, no, Jeff, come on.  He says, you know, you could, you're going to be able to play all sorts of things.  If you're an actor, you know, you'll get to, you know, do the musician thing, whatever  you like, you know, you use all of it.  So I'm glad I, I followed his instruction.  What instrument do you play?  Yeah.  Guitar and piano.  You're supposed to be very good.  I've heard you're very good.  Oh, I'm, you know, not real great musician, but I love playing music.  Like, I'm going out in the road here in a couple of days with my band. 
[01:42:00]  You do a band?  Yeah, yeah.  My daughter, Jessie, is going to open for me.  Oh, nice.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That sounds cool.  Yeah.  So, well, what's the name of your band and what kind of music you play?  The Abiders.  Nice.  Little country, little rock.  And do you sing?  I sing.  Okay.  Writes, tunes, you know.  That's cool.  A lot of actors are doing, like, who, Kevin Bacon's got the band with his brother.  Yeah, but we, he was in this movie that's coming out, R.I.P.D., and we jammed when  we were, you know, making that movie. 
[01:42:30]  That was a lot of fun.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, a lot of actors, you know.  Juliette Lewis is, like, she's got, like, a lot of music out.  Oh, she loves it.  Yeah, yeah, she's wonderful.  And her dad, you know, Jeff Lewis, we worked together before.  I don't know him.  Oh, yeah, he's been in all of Clint Eastwood movies.  You'd recognize him if you saw him.  Oh, really?  I'm going to look that up.  I'm going to Google that.  That was your first, by the way, Oscar nomination was for the Eastwood movie you did, I know, Thunderbolt  and Lightfoot.  A Picture Show was before that.  Oh, was that your second?  Yeah, but Jeff Lewis was in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. 
[01:43:00]  But who did he play?  I don't remember the movie.  He played, you know, there was Arthur.  He played George Kennedy, and he was George Kennedy's sidekick.  Do you find doing films now that, are the scripts, I find like a lot of the films are  not, like, they're just doing reboots and remakes of what they already did.  I know, man.  And I don't know what that is.  Yeah, well, it's, you know, it's the show business, it's the business aspect of showbiz,  you know, and they, I guess the financiers want a sure bet or something, but. 
[01:43:30]  They don't want to take as many chances?  Yeah, I think the fresh stuff, that's what people want to see.  They want to see something different.  Absolutely.  Can I tell you one of my favorite things you ever did?  You play a great psychopath, was the remake of The Vanishing.  Oh, yeah, but the original was much better, man.  Come on, did you see the original?  I did the French one, yeah.  Oh, see, because my guy, you know, my character, he got away with it.  Yeah.  And it was bizarre, the same director directed both of them, and he wanted, I guess he wanted  the. 
[01:44:00]  He wanted to change it up?  He wanted the American version, but it softened it, I thought.  Do you think he wanted it, or the studio told him?  No, he wanted it that way.  The studio probably wanted it that way, too, but I think he was into it.  Wasn't that, was it one of Sandra Bullock's early movies?  Yeah, it might have been her first, I think, I don't know.  Well, she plays Keeper Sutherland, all of a sudden they're at a rest stop, and she disappears,  and he becomes obsessed with just finding Diane, and he wants to find his girlfriend,  because she's gone.  Right.  And then it turns out that you, fucking Barney. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, God.  But the original was a masterpiece, I thought, that's what got me on board on that movie.  Now we gotta see the original.  Oh, God, it's chilling.  How did the original end?  The original ends when this guy's family, who buries all these people alive,  he's having a picnic with his family, you know, at his cabin, past the ketchup, you  know, and you know, underneath that table, under that table, there are all these people  he buried alive.  Oh, wow.  You know, life goes on, you know. 
[01:45:00]  Well, they let you know, because the thing was, he didn't know, I don't remember in the  French version, he didn't know how Diane died, he became obsessed with knowing what  happened to her, so Barney approaches him and says, I will, you'll experience everything  she experienced.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that leads us to a question, why do you think in America we need that?  We need a happy ending, or we need everything tied up all nice by the end of a movie.  Oh, that's how we want life to be.  But only in America, because when you do see the foreign films, they will go in those other  directions.  Every once in a while, an American movie will go dark. 
[01:45:30]  And we love it.  I dug it when, what was that movie it did about with, what was it, shit, I can't think  of the name of it.  You know, the bomb, the scare, you know, I know I get blown up, I can't think of it, it'll  come to me in a sec.  A little early in the morning.  That was a very dark ending of this particular movie.  I remember the studio, we got a note from the studio, we want you to shoot a positive ending.  And we went, oh, shit.  And the director made a very bold choice. 
[01:46:00]  He said, let's shoot it.  Arlington Road is the name of the movie.  Oh, just a little movie called Arlington Road.  And he says, let's make, we're going to, we've got to do it, but we're going to make  a terrible, we're going to just do a terrible job.  And that was bold, because, you know, we could have, we could have lost.  They could have said, thank you, and put that on there.  But thank God, they didn't.  That's great.  That's hilarious.  But that's typical studio thinking, I guess.  It's just, let's just get one in case the focus groups don't like.  Even in our dumb world, we get that. 
[01:46:30]  Like, oh, that was really good, but let's shoot a safety.  Yeah.  And do it this way.  And you're like, oh, that's the one they're going to use.  Yeah.  Do you think focus groups have hurt movies and stuff?  I mean, they make them more financially probably successful, but do you think they've hurt  like what, what films could become?  Maybe.  I, you know, I, I, I like the director to have the, you know, the visual.  One guy, I just let him do his deal.  You know, that's, that's my, you know, that's what I would vote for.  What motivates you to take a role?  Because you've turned down a few gems. 
[01:47:00]  Which ones?  Because that's, I hear rumors that I've turned down all kinds of things.  It's not true.  Hooper and Jaws.  No.  Is that true?  No.  Right here.  Turn down the role of Hooper and Jaws.  I don't know who Hooper is.  Who's Hooper?  Hooper was, Hooper was, the shark.  No, it was, uh, Matt Hooper was, uh, Richard Dreyfuss's part.  Oh, no, no.  Okay, that's one our, our, our Sal got wrong.  Was that Sal?  Unless I, unless I wasn't, I don't even know about it.  You know, that's.  Maybe your agent did. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Well, do you know of one that you did turn down?  No.  Not really?  Well, I can't think of anything I turned down that I wish I hadn't, you know.  Right, right.  But what did you turn down that would be considered a big movie?  Because you guys all have to have one.  I can't even.  Did you turn down the lead in Raiders of the Lost Ark?  No, negative.  I've heard that one.  Okay.  Wait, it's on the list?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I would never make this up.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Okay.  Those were two.  Do you have any more?  Or is that it for him?  Yeah.  Um, were you really in True Grit? 
[01:48:00]  Let's just make sure what I have.  Yeah, yeah.  I have the right stuff.  No, I'd like, I'd like to, well, on that one, you know, True Grit, working with the brothers,  you know, they're, they're the master of filmmakers, you know.  So anything they want me to do, I'm on board.  What motivates you to take a role?  Obviously, you have to like it, but is there other, do you, do you care about who you're  working with or do you care about this?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's a big part of it.  Uh, the kind of movie I like to see, you know, that's kind of the, where the filmmakers  are kind of ahead of you.  Something fresh, you know, that's, you know, a little different. 
[01:48:30]  And what do you do?  They say you meditate before you go on set or is that just another lie that's been thrown  into the prep sheet?  It's a semi-lie.  I meditate at times, you know.  But you don't do it before you walk on set every time?  Not every time.  Okay.  We just have no accurate information.  Your name is spelled J-E-F-F?  Three Fs.  Three Fs.  It's fucking amazing.  I love meditation.  I just got into it.  You said, yeah?  I just got into it.  I don't know what the hell I'm doing, Mr. Bridges.  That's the, that's, you're right on that.  But I like it.  Isn't it cool?  It's cool. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, yeah.  It settles my brain.  And I want to get into it even deeper.  Yeah.  Try to figure it all out.  Just ten minutes a day, just by yourself.  Oh, man.  Trying to get that brain silent.  I can't make myself do it.  My mind just won't stop.  Well, that's nonsense.  That's okay.  That's what the mind does.  You know, you should let it do your thing and just say thanks and go back to your, yeah.  Right, right?  Yeah.  What do you do if you itch?  I always have an itch.  Like, if I'm trying to relax and not do anything, something itches.  Well, that means you're not really meditating.  Because all that goes away if you do it properly. 
[01:49:30]  I know.  I've never done it properly in my life.  Because I do it, I do it on the Upper West Side.  And it's really loud outside the window.  And you hear the trucks.  And next thing you know, you go, whoa, wait.  I didn't hear the trucks for the last ten minutes.  Then you know you're meditating.  I wrote a book recently, you know, called The Dude and the Zen Master.  Nice.  And the Zen Master is this cat named Bernie Glassman.  Right.  Who is a homeboy here.  And he's, you know, from New York.  And we had a great time making that. 
[01:50:00]  And he's a wonderful guy.  Yeah, he's...  What's it about?  It's about, you know, it's about sitting.  But Bernie came to me and he said, Jeff, you realize in Buddhist circles, the dude is considered the Zen Master.  And I said, what are you talking about, man?  He says, oh, yeah.  He says, you know, Lebowski is full of modern-day koans.  Koans are these kind of Zen, you know, questions that you have to, you know, answer experientially sort of. 
[01:50:30]  And I said, what are you talking about?  He says, well, look at it.  The koan brothers, you know, for one thing.  And then he mentions all these koans.  Like, you know, probably one of the most famous koans.  What's the sound of one hand clapping?  You know, that kind of thing.  You know, it makes your money.  And I said, well, give me an example.  He said, well, you know, shut the fuck up, Donnie.  There's a koan for you, you know.  And he kind of explained that.  Or the dude abides or whatever.  He says, let's write a book about the koans that are in Lebowski. 
[01:51:00]  So that's what the book is about.  Nice.  I'm going to have to pick that up.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so it's like, we have to plug what the movie is, because they're telling us we have  like eight minutes left.  R.I.P.D.  It opens Friday, July 19th.  I could talk to Jeff Bridges all morning.  Yeah, all I want to do is ask you questions about movies.  You fucking, Fearless.  I loved Fearless.  The Big Lebowski, obviously.  Oh, that's a good one.  Fearless or The Big Lebowski?  Both.  I think Fearless, Big Lebowski got a tremendous amount of love, but Fearless, I thought, was 
[01:51:30]  very underrated.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  In hindsight.  I thought so.  Dragon Edge, going way back.  I mean, you know, it's crazy.  Look at how many movies he's done.  Yeah, it's a very impressive resume going back to, I think, the early 70s.  Now, you've had a bomb or two, right?  I guess, yeah.  Is that a bad feeling when you know the movie just didn't work?  Sometimes, yeah.  Yeah, you know, sometimes, you know, so many things have to come together to make it, you  know, a success.  You've got to count on so many people doing their parts. 
[01:52:00]  There's so many things, you know.  Yeah, I remember I made a movie that I really enjoyed called The Amateurs.  Great cast.  It was all about, you know, a little town making a porn movie.  We had a great time making it.  And, you know, the guy who distributed it, you know, was a crook and it never, they just  never saw the light of day at all.  You know, but you've got to, you know, kind of let it go.  So is that movie not out there anywhere?  It's probably on DVD or something.  It's really funny. 
[01:52:30]  Ted Danson is just great at it.  Wow.  That's so weird.  Yeah.  All the time.  They just put the movie on the shelf for years.  Well, yeah.  The guy went bankrupt.  I mean, you know.  And no one could go and say, screw it, let's try to figure out how to get this out there.  No, no.  Yeah.  Drove the poor writer and director who was wonderful.  Mike Traeger kind of, you know, gave him a stroke.  Can you imagine working on something for a couple of years and then just...  It's your baby.  Oh, and you love... 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, it's your baby.  And you get Jeff Bridges and Ted Danson to do it.  Right.  Oh, man.  Like, that's a miracle in itself.  And I got these guys and you're telling me that no one's going to see this?  Some scummy distributor fucks everything up for you.  Oh, that's awful.  We got to talk about the new movie, obviously.  R.I.P.D.  I want to make sure I get it right.  You are a slain police officer who joins a team of undead police officers working for  the Rest and Peace Department. 
[01:53:30]  I'm not close.  No cigar.  No.  Once again, you fucking idiot.  By the way, I am just reading...  Jeff, I just want you to know you're on a very professional show here.  Yeah.  Of course.  It might not sound that way.  Or seem that way, I should say.  Here's what's going on.  R.I.P.D.  First of all, it stands for Rest in Peace Department.  Okay, I have that.  Although some people are calling it R.I.P.D.  Which works out.  Right, right, right.  But anyway, I play a marshal from the 1800s 
[01:54:00]  who is no longer with us.  I'm dead.  I belong to the Rest and Peace Department.  And the Rest and Peace Department has made up of all of these wonderful peace officers  who are now after dead people  who want to be alive still and actually exist and are walking amongst us.  And we are, you know, taking them back where they belong.  And I'm partnered with a wonderful actor, Ryan Reynolds, 
[01:54:30]  who is a modern-day cop who's also dead.  And he wants to get back amongst the living.  And we are undeados.  Okay, so if Ryan Reynolds was recently killed, maybe this is accurate then.  Maybe he's the recently slain cop.  There you go.  It sort of made sense.  A recently slain cop joins a team of undead police officers.  But he's not the recently slain cop.  He's from the 1800s, Mr. Jeff Bridges.  Gotcha.  Do you like playing a guy from back then more?  Or do you prefer playing a modern guy more?  Or do you not care? 
[01:55:00]  I do not care.  You know, it's fun cowboy guys.  I mean, I love the, you know, westerns.  You know, they're wonderful.  What's amazing about you, though, is like no matter who you play,  whether it's a cowboy or whether it's, you know, Barney,  you always bring some, you never seem to play the,  you always play an interesting guy doing that  as opposed to some predictable version of that character,  if that makes any sense.  Thank you.  There's always some weirdness to it.  And, like, you know, really, no one can play what you do the way you do it. 
[01:55:30]  Thank you, man.  I appreciate that.  And I know that that was really a kind of shitty off-kilter compliment.  I'll take it.  I'll take it.  No, but I mean that.  How do you, I always ask great actors,  how do you make something yours when you see it?  Well, you know, when you're preparing for the role,  what I do is look inside myself, you know,  think of different aspects of myself that, you know,  kind of work for the character, and I might magnify those, you know, 
[01:56:00]  and got, you know, aspects of myself that don't look,  kind of kick to the side, and so kind of like that.  And then I look, you know, I find when I'm working,  it's probably like with you guys, you know,  are you always looking for things to put on the show?  Oh, yeah.  You know, you just, so you just, I'm just open,  and I'm looking at people.  I say, oh, see how he's twirling that?  I think I'll use that.  Right, right.  You know, just that my mind's always, you know.  Always working.  Always working.  Smart.  You'll incorporate something that you see or experience during the day. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  God, I hope my pen twirling ends up in a Jeff Bridges movie.  I'll go, that was because of me.  I know it.  Or did you do it just for me?  Right, exactly.  His next role, he'll just ask completely wrong things to a guest,  and that will be the contribution from this program.  Do you, are you the same, like when the camera cuts,  do you live in the role for a little while,  or are you immediately back to being Jeff?  That's funny.  I remember doing an interview at home one day, 
[01:57:00]  and the guy asked me that same question,  and I said, you know, I'm really not the kind of actor,  who, you know, takes his work home,  and I, you know, don't have people call me by my character's name,  and that sort of thing,  and I was doing the movie Jagged Edge,  where I was playing, you know, a psychopath, basically,  and the guy says, oh, really, you don't do that,  and my wife happened to be in the room,  and she went,  I said, why did you, why did you, why did you do that, sir? 
[01:57:30]  She says, you don't think you do.  You don't think you bring it home, but you do.  So I think subconsciously, the character lingers, you know,  but I'm not aware of it.  I don't try to do it on purpose.  You're not afraid of, like, if you,  if you pick up something for a movie,  and you become this guy,  you're not afraid of losing that,  like on the two or three days you have off or whatever,  you're not afraid it's going to go away?  No, it's kind of a nice rest, you know,  take a rest from it, it seems to pop back.  It does.  Yeah.  Did you know Marlon Brando?  No, no.  Really?  I'm always trying to talk to people. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, I admire him.  We had James Lipton in, and he discussed Brando,  and I just love hearing about how fucking nuts Marlon Brando was.  I can never get sick of him.  My brother worked with him.  In what?  Actually, it turned out that he was replaced by James Mason,  but he rehearsed with Brando for a long time,  and Bo, he told me a story, he said,  and I was working with Marlon,  and Marlon came up to me, and he said,  Bo, do you mind if I put my lines on your forehead? 
[01:58:30]  Bo said, well, sure, Marlon, but why?  I'm just curious.  He said, well, I want to have eye contact.  I want to appear that I'm looking at you.  You know, it's funny.  I'd heard stories about that,  and I never knew if it was true.  Well, did he do it?  Yes.  He did.  With Marlon Brando, whatever, yeah, whatever, Marlon, you know.  But I would think he's just saying that to see if you would go, sure.  No, he really meant it.  There's so many weird ways of acting.  Another thing, I heard that he, 
[01:59:00]  maybe Brando invented this,  but I worked with other actors who use this,  and it's kind of fascinating.  You know what an earwig is?  No.  Oh, is it the earpiece?  Yes, a little earpiece that you put in,  and they can't see, you know.  And this particular actor,  and I hear Brando did this all the time,  didn't memorize his lines at all.  And he had an assistant in another room  who would give him his lines.  Wow.  So this actor that I was working with, 
[01:59:30]  you know, you'd be talking to him,  and he would have this kind of blank stare,  and then there would be a pause,  and then he would say his line.  And it was kind of a wonderful effect,  something that I wanted to try.  But how did it,  didn't it look like you weren't in the moment  if it required a faster,  like if you have to cock your head to hear?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But fortunately,  the guy's character's name was some idiot.  They can edit that out, too.  But wouldn't it be wild?  Is it an actor we know? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, but I'm not going to...  I figured you wouldn't.  I'm not going to push you,  but is it a pretty famous one?  Yeah.  But wouldn't it be great  if, you know, a whole play like that,  where everybody had earwigs,  there was no lines,  and there were people in the other room  just giving him, you know,  so I think it would be an interesting effect.  That would be amazing, yeah.  If you hope that the piece worked,  because there's nothing worse than, like,  watch, watch.  Would they actually, in final cut,  would they take the dialogue 
[02:00:30]  and put it closer together?  Would they cut out that pause time,  or would they leave it?  No, it was left in this case.  I mean, the guy's name's some idiot.  You know, they just leave it,  you know, that glaze, it worked.  Yeah, I heard Brando did that  because he just didn't feel like  doing the work anymore,  but then I heard on The Godfather,  if you see, like, screen,  like, caps of that,  there's, like, lines written  all over the kitchen, like...  Oh, yeah, yeah,  a lot of ways to do it, man,  a lot of ways to do it.  Do you find more...  Are you more comfortable  knowing everything before you go in,  or do you kind of like to learn as you go?  I'd like to know my stuff, you know,  but each one is different. 
[02:01:00]  I remember a couple of them,  like I did a movie with Tommy,  Lee Jones,  and one of my favorite actors,  Blown Away, was...  Yeah.  And we're getting towards,  you know, the climax of the scene.  We all knew from the beginning  that that scene wasn't working.  We said, well, we'll fix it,  you know, and it was the day,  and they couldn't fix it, man,  you know.  What are we going to do?  Well, put it on the damn cards, man.  I say, put it on...  And I've got to, you know,  do this scene with one of my favorite actors 
[02:01:30]  with reading cards off the back,  you know, from behind his head,  you know, stuff like that.  What do you mean?  The fixes that they put for the scene?  Not the fixes.  The whole, you know,  I had like a monologue, you know.  The whole big thing.  Or with Iron Man,  you know, you'd think  with a $200 million movie,  they'd have a script, you know.  But often,  Downey and Favreau and I  would be in our trailer  working on the scene for that day  trying to write it 
[02:02:00]  while they're all tapping their foot  waiting for us to come to work.  And we're, you know, saying,  okay, you play my part,  I'll play your part.  Let's figure, you know,  Favreau.  Oh, I know a good writer.  Let me call this writer.  He might have some idea.  No way.  Yes, yes, man.  You would never think  on a big budget film  that would happen.  Well, so that freaked me out.  Of course.  Because like I was saying,  my M.O. is, you know,  learning my lines, you know,  and then so I don't have  to think about it.  But I made a,  so it drove me crazy at first,  but then I made a little  inner adjustment. 
[02:02:30]  I just said,  oh, Jeff,  you're making a $200 million  student film.  Just relax, have fun.  You know, and look at the result.  It came out great.  It was great.  You know, so there's a lot  of ways to do it, man.  The process is so interesting,  isn't it?  Sometimes.  It's fucking,  because I've done it  and it's really hard to do well  and I'm amazed by guys  who do it so well.  I have a follow-up question.  So the blown away scene,  did it end up working in the end?  Not really, huh?  I mean, you know,  when I watch movies 
[02:03:00]  that I'm in,  there is a home movie aspect to it,  you know,  because I remember,  you know,  everything that went down.  I'm not just following the story,  so that, you know,  it's stuck in my craw.  Gotcha.  Is there a monologue  you look back on  or a moment you look back on  and you go like that,  you know,  if that's something  I would want everyone  to remember me by,  like one moment  or one monologue  that you felt like  I did that really well?  One that comes to mind,  I don't know if it was a monologue,  but it just popped in my head, 
[02:03:30]  was the dude  getting into the car  with the big Lebowski,  you know,  trying to backpedal,  you know,  and getting the toe  and all that stuff.  I dug that scene quite a bit.  Yeah,  that movie's classic.  Those writers, man,  I mean,  the Coen brothers,  the black guy.  They made a lot of great films.  And they make it look so easy,  you know.  Right.  Yeah.  I think he's got to go.  Thanks.  Well, yeah,  the last thing I have to say  is we interviewed your brother  once on the phone. 
[02:04:00]  The incident is fantastic.  Yeah, yeah.  Drives me nuts  that everybody doesn't know  that movie.  Oh, yeah,  that's a great movie.  Was that his first?  Marty Sheen,  yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know if it was his first,  but that was early,  yeah.  And Ed McMahon.  Ed McMahon,  right.  And Brock Peters.  It was such a great movie.  Oh, yeah.  About just a problem  on a train.  It was Martin Sheen's  first movie.  I really don't know the movie.  Oh, it's Black and White.  I got to see that, too.  Tony Masante.  It was really great,  and all I wanted to do  was talk to Bo Bridges  about it.  So whenever there's  a Bridges around,  you have to mention it.  Sure.  All right, RIPD, 
[02:04:30]  obviously with Ryan Reynolds  and Jeff Bridges,  opens this Friday,  July 19th.  Oh, you are on Twitter.  The Jeff Bridges,  spelled with a J,  J-E-F-F Bridges,  on Twitter.  And do you read  all your at mentions?  No, man.  I don't even know  what that is,  my at mentions.  You know,  I have someone  to handle all the  Facebook and Twitter stuff.  What's this vining?  Do you know about that?  What is that?  Is that the next thing?  People are enjoying it.  What is it? 
[02:05:00]  Six, seven seconds?  Six second videos.  Oh, my God.  And then they can jack with it  and do weird things with it.  Yeah, and Instagram  is like 15 second videos.  I like the Instagram.  You can get a lot done  in 15 seconds.  It's all happening  too fast for me, man.  I don't dig that.  No, you don't like  the technology?  No, I mean,  it's too overwhelming,  isn't it?  I mean, if you don't  answer your emails  for a couple of days,  forget it.  You're just swamped.  Yeah, but can you  picture life anymore  without computers or email?  I can't picture life without it.  I'm hooked for it.  I kind of dig it 
[02:05:30]  and hate it all  at the same time.  Or leaving your house  without your phone.  That's like a tragedy now.  Yeah, oh.  We come from a time  where you just did that.  You didn't have a phone.  Yeah, and everybody  can get you anytime.  I used to like  being off the grid.  Yeah.  I thought I was  doing crazy shit.  It was just nice.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, it's just me  for a few hours.  No one could get a hold of me.  Do you remember  leaving for the airport  and you knew you'd call the guy  when you got to the hotel?  Right.  There was no way  to get a hold of you  unless I used a pay phone  in the airport.  So it would be six, 
[02:06:00]  seven hours  before you could talk  to somebody.  And now I'm literally  texting until the door.  Oh, yeah.  No, I don't text.  Oh, you don't?  My wife texts.  She feels all modern.  She feels all modern.  Yeah, I don't.  Yeah, that's another thing.  You know, you got to keep up.  I don't want to keep up.  Oh, God.  Well, what do you do  for fun when you're not acting?  I know you got to go,  but the music,  which you're hitting the road with.  I like, you know,  I do ceramics, you know.  Photography, too, I heard.  Photography, yeah.  Do you take pictures  of the other actors?  That's the main thing I do. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  I'll get you guys a book.  I took some shots of R.I.P.D.  I'll get you guys a book.  Oh, yeah, I'd love to see that.  Absolutely.  He loves his photography.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Are you a photographer?  No, I mean, you do.  You do, but I take pictures  with people,  and I do it poorly.  No, I don't take  very good pictures.  Jimmy's thing is he's obsessed  with getting pictures  with celebrities.  Oh, well.  I like to do it.  It's an obsession, though.  Yeah, and you do,  like, this selfie?  I have a couple of times.  Selfies?  Yeah, I got Sidney Poitier  in a pharmacy.  I had to do a shitty iPhone selfie. 
[02:07:00]  But, you know,  what you got to do  is you got to do  when you're getting,  you know,  getting fucking Cialis  in Beverly Hills.  So if you say no  to a picture  after this interview,  it'll make my day.  Certainly.  Because he'll be so bummed out.  He will be bummed out.  I wouldn't be angry.  I would just be sad.  I was on a flight  with Joe Pesci recently,  and he wouldn't take  the picture because  of everything you're  talking about.  I just wanted a picture  with Joe Pesci.  He goes,  oh, man,  I just don't look good  right now.  I flew all night.  It was like one  of those red eyes.  And he just would not 
[02:07:30]  take the picture.  I'm like, look,  I don't even need  to tweet it.  I just want a picture  with you.  Maybe he could have  taken a picture  with his hand.  Yeah.  He just put his hand  in the front.  He's got to put  your hands out.  That is Joe Pesci.  That's a great one.  The next one,  it says no.  That one bummed me out.  You know,  I'm not as obsessed  like Jimmy,  but that one was a bummer.  I don't want to creep out  my new Hollywood best friend.  Yeah,  we feel like we're  friends with you now.  Good, man.  You better come back.  Yeah.  You should come back  with the band  and play a song.  We would love that. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, good deal, yeah.  You going to come  and perform in New York?  Yeah,  next time we're going  to go to Texas  and Nashville  and then we're going  to work on our way  up the coast.  Yeah,  we'll get up here.  All right.  Well,  the great Jeff Bridges,  I love you.  I think you're just,  you're fantastic.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  And the movie's RIPD  and it opens Friday,  so let's all go see that.  All right.  All right,  Jeff Bridges, everyone.  See you guys.  The OP&A 3 Show  on Sirius X. 
[02:08:30]  Sirius X.  This is the OP&A 3 Show.  The OP&A 3 Show.  The OP&A 3 Show.  I got to say,  Jeff Bridges might be  one of my favorites 
[02:09:00]  of all time.  Simply put.  What a great guy.  I loved him.  I loved him.  He seems like  the nicest guy ever.  I don't know if he's  faking it,  but I felt like,  I felt like going,  you know,  Jeff,  we got another hour here  and then I think  we should go  and get a bite to eat.  Would that have been  a mistake, Jimmy?  No.  He's just hanging out, man.  Yeah.  That vibe.  He's like a down-to-earth guy.  He's been in  so many huge movies.  Yeah, 
[02:09:30]  I was on my way over today.  I was like racking my brain  of like how many  Jeff Bridges movies  I've seen.  And I mean,  just recently,  he was a bad guy  in Iron Man.  Yeah.  I completely forgot about that.  I mean,  stuff right off,  like the True Grit,  Crazy Heart.  Yeah.  Hello.  And that was about it,  really.  Starman.  Starman.  A Hat for Winkle.  A Hat for Winkle  was one of his big ones.  Sea Biscuit.  Sea Biscuit?  Oh,  The Contender? 
[02:10:00]  Arlington Road.  Arlington Road?  The Contender.  Big Lebowski.  Big Lebowski.  Which was an amazing movie.  Jim mentioned  The Vanishing earlier.  Tron.  Fearless.  Fabulous Baker Boys.  Oh, shit.  I forgot about that movie.  Jimmy said  The Vanishing.  Fearless.  Blown Away.  Jagged Edge.  Jagged Edge.  The Big Lebowski  is my second favorite  comedy movie  of all time.  Jagged Edge.  Who was in that?  That was,  what's her name? 
[02:10:30]  Who we had at once,  right?  Wasn't Cher in that?  No,  it was The Broad  from the other movie  where she was a stalker.  Jagged Edge was with  Fade,  I mean,  Fade Tunaway.  Yeah,  she's a regular.  Glenn Close.  Thank you.  Glenn Close.  And I wanted to mention  to Mr. Bridges,  I got obsessed  with film flubs  and they used to have,  they used to write books  about film flubs,  you know,  continuity errors  in films. 
[02:11:00]  And Jagged Edge  has a classic one  with Glenn Close  and maybe you could  find it online,  Sam Roberts,  where it's a courtroom scene  and her suit jacket,  her suit jacket  or her whole outfit  changes colors  mid-scene  and no one picked up on it.  Really?  Yep.  That seems outrageous.  Well,  it was way back  when they didn't really  totally focus on continuity  as they do nowadays.  I mean,  for Christ's sakes,  you'd think they'd have  the fucking costumes  in order.  Yeah,  but I forgot  it went from brown to blue 
[02:11:30]  or blue to brown  in mid-scene.  They cut away  and they come back to her  and she's wearing  a different color  like,  you know,  courtroom suit.  Her skirt was suddenly  brown in the back.  You got that,  Sam?  Remind me,  I saw a film flub  last night at court.  You did?  Yep.  I love film flubs.  I'm obsessed with them.  We used to do drinking games  with film flubs.  You'd get a movie  where there was  a million of them  and you would call it.  And sometimes we would  call it before it happened  and you would get  extra points for that  and we were fucking geeks.  What's like a classic movie 
[02:12:00]  that's got tons  if you were going  to play that game?  It was the one  with Michael J. Fox.  What the fuck  was the name of the movie?  There was a million.  He crashes into a picket fence.  That was very good.  Doc Holliday.  Doc Holliday has a million.  Thank you.  Doc Holliday?  Doc Holliday.  Yeah,  Doc Holliday.  I like that movie.  But that film  has a million of them.  Oh, really?  He crashes into a picket fence  and then they go back  to the car  and all the stuff  is off the hood of the car.  Really?  But initially after the crash  it was on the car.  Stuff like that. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah,  but I love film flubs.  It makes the movie fun.  What did you see last night?  In The Conjuring they had one?  No, no, no.  Oh, did you see that?  Yeah, I saw yesterday.  Was it good?  I was very scared.  Very scared.  The scary is Insidious?  It's the guy that did Insidious.  Oh, you know what's funny?  Oh, we talked about it yesterday, Joe.  Yes, that's not surprising  that it's the same guy.  Okay.  And he also made the same mistake.  I'm not going to say what, but...  I know what you mean already.  I will say...  One of my favorite movies  growing up was  The Idol Maker 
[02:13:00]  with Ray Sharkey  where he plays this guy  who discovers these young guys  and makes them famous.  And I used to tape...  I forgot that I used to tape record  Ray Sharkey's dialogue.  Whenever there was profanity on TV,  I would tape it.  Why?  I love profanity.  I loved it growing up as a kid  because to me,  there were such strong expressions  of thought.  You know what I mean?  God damn it!  Like a guy who could say  God damn it really well  in a 1980 movie  like The Great Santee.  That type of shit  I would tape.  And I loved it. 
[02:13:30]  I was tweeting as Chip  while watching...  I did a couple of fucking two...  No, one video.  One video I backed off on.  I did one video as...  I Chip while I was watching  The Idol Maker  while Cesare was on stage.  Cesare.  Nobody remembers The Idol Maker?  No.  I never heard of it.  The Idol Maker?  Ray Sharkey?  I don't know who Ray Sharkey is.  Died of AIDS in 93, I think.  I think AIDS.  I should say I think.  I don't look Ray Sharkey.  Yeah.  The Idol Maker was fucking good. 
[02:14:00]  I gotta get a movie list from you.  You've seen a lot of movies  that I haven't seen  and they seem like  they're really good movies  that just didn't get as much attention.  Well, this wasn't an amazing movie  but one of the things is  they're making a...  He's making this teen idol  this guy Cesare  who was a waiter.  Right.  And he's changing his name  to Cesare  and they're plastering posters  all over.  It's supposed to be the 50s.  And when you can see  that they're plastering  all these Cesare posters  and behind it  I can see the razor blade  and I realize  it's fucking British Steel  by Judas Priest.  They've just kind of put this 
[02:14:30]  over a 1980 fucking...  No kidding.  Yeah.  I was like,  you lazy fuckers.  You lazy fuckers.  Was that the film flub?  Mm-hmm.  Hmm.  He did die  HIV positive.  I don't...  What else was Ray Sharkey in?  I've never heard of this.  I don't know.  But again,  this movie was on cable a lot  so I would fucking put  my little fucking blue...  my recorder  my blue cassettes  and there were certain films  I recorded  like Stir Crazy  this  I would just record  some of the stronger  dirty lines from. 
[02:15:00]  Right.  Loved it.  Very cool.  You know what's funny  when I was...  I'm sorry.  No, go Joe.  When I was little...  Please.  Let me get out of your way.  I insist.  When I was little...  I missed you, Joe.  I missed you too.  All right.  Go ahead.  When I was little  profanity used to bother me.  It used to upset me a lot  and if I was watching a...  Really?  When I was like  six, seven years old  when I was watching a movie  with my mom and dad  and somebody would say fuck  I would...  my stomach would drop  in the same way  it would if you see something  like visually shocking  on TV 
[02:15:30]  like very violent  and you're not expecting it  that queasy feeling you get  I would get that same thing  when I heard fuck  when I was a kid  and I'd make my mom  turn the movie off.  What a douche.  I know.  I'm not saying it was cool.  It's just the polar opposite of you.  I failed to see how  like injustice for all.  Wait.  You changed your kitten tattoo.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Sorry, Jimmy.  No, we'll move on to the...  Hold on.  We'll move on to the kitten tattoo  but say what you were going to say, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no, dude, please.  I don't even remember.  It was something about 
[02:16:00]  language and recording  and justice for all.  I would rather...  What did you do?  It's still healing.  That's why it's read like that.  Okay.  You can't take the abuse anymore?  No, it wasn't that.  It was that...  People made fun of that tattoo, Joe.  I know they did  but it was your mistake.  And it looked like  you wrote kitten on your forearm  but it was a George Carlin quote.  Right.  And I didn't have a problem  with the kitten thing  or the people made fun of it.  What I had a problem with  was it was two really large  very hard  aggressive looking K's  and I honestly had  a few people say to me like  what is that man  with this like...  Is that Aryan? 
[02:16:30]  Like almost...  I just got self-conscious.  I walked down the street  and I noticed sometimes  black people  kind of stare at it  like what are those K's  on his arm?  What was it originally?  K-K...  It's K-K-T-I-T-N.  Keep kicking them in the nuts.  With a period.  With a period.  It was trashed.  All capital letters  and a period.  I know.  I didn't like the period.  The period was a bad decision.  Of course it was.  I never thought  of the K-K-K angle though.  I would respect that more.  You were one K away  from a nice beating. 
[02:17:00]  I know.  So what I did was  to cover the K  we put lines on top  of either side of it  and then he was...  And it got rid of the period  so Jimmy should be  more comfortable.  And then he said  we should put a line  on the back  but the lines were  coming out to here  and I said you know what  it almost could look  like a microphone  if we put some mesh up there.  So he did  and it's like a...  It looks like a cigarette.  Wait, that's not  the beginning of a cover-up?  That's it?  That's it.  It doesn't look  like a microphone.  It looks like a candy cigarette.  It doesn't look  anything like a microphone.  No.  It doesn't look like a microphone.  No, it doesn't. 
[02:17:30]  It doesn't look like a microphone.  No, microphones are not that...  Who are you?  Bob Barker?  No, that's what it's supposed to be.  It's supposed to be  like one of those old school mics.  I'm telling you  it doesn't look like a microphone.  No, it doesn't.  Just have it filled in  and just say it's a black bar  and it's for,  you know, whatever.  It's for Trayvon.  He failed making  that into a microphone.  I'm sorry, Joe.  Who did that?  How about we do this?  Fucking Bill Burr.  He did your fucking tattoo work.  It looks like a cigarette.  Get the interns in here.  Do they know?  Make sure they're not listening.  I'll find somebody  who doesn't know.  Because you're not 
[02:18:00]  going to believe us.  So I'm going to  march people in here  and ask them  what it looks like.  I won't say anymore  to not give it away,  but honestly,  when we were doing it,  the part of it  was supposed to be  that was kind of abstract.  I didn't want it  to look like this picture  of a thing.  Well, it worked.  Were you guys  just listening to the show?  Yeah.  So you know  what we're talking about?  A tattoo.  Yeah.  What does the tattoo look like?  Be honest.  Well, I'm going to...  It's a cover-up  for his kitten tattoo. 
[02:18:30]  Most people say...  Hold on.  Sydney went...  It's like a ruler.  It's still healing.  That's why it's red and scabby.  It looks like a ruler.  What's it look like  to you, Sydney?  Back home,  we have this kid  who gives himself tattoos  at home  and it looks like that.  These girls are terrific.  You look like that.  They always come to the table  with something.  You look like a kid  from Fort Myers  who fucking gives himself tattoos.  All right, look at it.  If it's a microphone,  though,  where's the...  You know, like the... 
[02:19:00]  The microphone is quality.  The head.  The head of the microphone.  They have those  like the kid's spelled kitten.  All right, wait, wait, wait.  All right.  He didn't hear.  You didn't hear.  Troy Kwan,  who knows a bit  about tattoos, obviously.  Wow.  Troy's got some good ones, man.  When are you going  to do the neck tattoo?  You're going there, aren't you?  I'm thinking about it.  I know you are.  I could tell.  I could just tell.  But I did the hand.  That's a big move.  Yeah, you got full sleeves now.  Holy shit.  Oh, the blue hand is great.  What is that?  It's like... 
[02:19:30]  This is all old skateboard graphics.  This is Santa Cruz.  This is Mark Gonzalez,  Tony Hawk,  Mike Vallele,  Steve Caballero.  You really got good work, man.  Thanks.  I love...  One of my favorites  is the fucking...  You might want to introduce  Joe DeRosa to your tattoo guy.  The guy...  Listen.  What do you think  of Joe's cover-up?  That's a cover-up.  It's not a cover-up, though.  All right, don't say what it is.  All right.  What does it look like to you?  Uh...  Kitten?  Kitten something?  No, but what does 
[02:20:00]  the thing around it look like?  Yeah, now it's...  He's turning it  into something else.  And he really thinks  that the guy did a good job.  No, but...  Joe, I'm...  You've not explained this right.  All right, yes, we are.  All right, it's...  Before I get beat up  by Bill Burr again  for being nasty to you.  What?  Are you kidding me?  It's all fun, I think.  Stop it.  Go ahead, Joe.  Go ahead.  It's just...  It's not being turned  into something else.  I put a framing  around the letters  to give it...  He was worried that it  looked like a KKK tattoo. 
[02:20:30]  It did.  It was...  The Ks were too aggressive.  So I went to a guy  and he goes,  look, we could soften it up  a little bit.  We could maybe add something  to it to just kind of  just soften up the tattoo  a little bit.  But it's not soft.  It just has a border around it.  Well, he meant like  kind of take some  of the emphasis  off of the letters  a little bit.  What it just takes  some of the focus.  Well, first of all,  it's still healing.  So it's a little scabby,  but it looks like...  Like the one side  looks like honeycomb.  Like...  You know what I mean?  Like a...  So you look like security 
[02:21:00]  at the honeycomb hideout.  We said it looked like  a cigarette.  But it's supposed  to look like something.  And he's mad.  He thinks we're  fucking with him.  At first it looks like...  Quick, it just looks  like kitten.  Okay.  You see the cigarette.  Oh, that's a cigarette?  No, it's not a cigarette.  It's supposed to be  something else.  He's turning it  into something else.  I'm looking at Troy's blue hand  with a screaming mouth in it,  which is perfectly done.  And you got a rectangle wrong.  You got to go  to fucking Troy's guy.  You got to go  to Troy's guy.  This is done, by the way.  There's no more covering. 
[02:21:30]  That's done.  It's a done tattoo.  Yeah.  I got to introduce  you to my tattoo artist.  I like this.  What is it?  What is it?  No, you don't.  It's supposed to be  sort of just an abstract  old school mic.  Oh, now he adds  the word abstract.  I said that earlier.  Did you?  Yes.  Okay.  It's supposed to be...  Abstract and it doesn't  look like a microphone,  I guess.  But it's supposed...  Here's why the mic  looks like that.  When I first started  recording music and stuff  when I was in  like fifth grade...  Look at Troy's face.  He's got a lipstick to you. 
[02:22:00]  I'll explain.  We used to have...  I used to have these  little flathead mics  from the 1960s  that looked like that.  And I was like,  oh, it's kind of to me,  it's like the first mic  I ever used looked like that.  Maybe you should have  taken a picture of those mics  and gave it to your tattoo artist.  Maybe you should walk around  and tell everybody that  as they're looking at your arm  like, what the fuck is that?  Ruler Honeycomb thing.  You're going to get tired  of telling that story  over and over again.  But here's my thing.  I hear what you're saying.  I don't give a fuck  if anybody gets it or not.  My point is,  once that's healed  and whatever,  I don't think you'd look  at that and be like,  what the fuck? 
[02:22:30]  You'd just be like,  he's got some weird thing  that I don't understand.  It looked like there's  something on the end  that maybe you covered up.  Yeah, it's permanent.  Yeah.  And tattoo laser removal  is getting really good now.  Is it really?  Yeah, I can think of  three that you would have removed.  What do you mean by really good?  Would you see scarring there  or the tattoo really faded out?  It really starts to fade out.  You barely could tell  there was a tattoo over there?  Yeah, and if you keep doing it,  it'll eventually go away,  but it'll fade enough  where you could cover it up.  You could get something  to cover it up.  Is it painful to do? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Or it hurts like shit.  What do they do?  They basically go in  and just break the pigment down  and then your body  actually just starts  flushing it out.  How do they break it down?  With a needle?  No, with a laser.  Why does it hurt?  Can't they numb it?  I'm sure they could,  but when you go into that,  when you start doing numbing,  you have to have  a doctor's license  to do stuff like that.  Oh, really?  So you just need  a certain license  to take the pain.  Yeah.  But there are people  that could do both, right?  Can they numb it?  Yeah, there's a,  yeah, I mean,  if they're certified  in being able to do that. 
[02:23:30]  Joe, let's talk about this.  What's going on  on the other one?  Those are new too, huh?  This one's new.  This one's old.  I've had that one long.  What is the,  let's see.  This?  Yeah.  Stop getting tattoos.  He's sending it to the mic.  It's a valid question.  I said,  does that remind you  to stop getting tattoos?  See,  she's terrific every time.  That was a good one.  That was a fucking  home run, Sydney.  Yes, it was.  It was.  It hurt a little bit.  What is it supposed to be?  The circle with the line? 
[02:24:00]  It's a lot of things.  Is there any way  I'm going to explain this  and not just get trashed  from front to back?  But the locations  are even awful.  Your locations  make everyone uncomfortable.  But one is like  off to this  off center  on the forearm.  One is under  the fucking  crook of the elbow.  That tattoo looks like  it's slipping off  his bicep.  What's off center?  This one?  No, the other one.  The fucking  kitten honeycomb.  The other one  is a microphone.  Abstract.  Were you drunk  when you got those?  No. 
[02:24:30]  You were fully  aware of what you were doing?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  It's coming to my  mouth.  Here's the...  Can you explain  that tattoo,  the new one?  I can...  This is the newest one.  All right,  but the one...  The circle  with the line  to return.  I can explain  all these.  This one was fine.  It worked.  It was what I wanted.  It looked the way  I wanted.  Yeah, it was exactly  what I wanted.  It was perfect.  It was exactly  what I wanted.  Right on.  This one,  with the letters,  that's being  screwed on.  Yeah.  Yes.  This one, 
[02:25:00]  the tattoo artist  was supposed to...  I was new to tattoos,  and the tattoo artist  was supposed to select  all these fonts,  and we're supposed  to work through it together  and all this stuff.  She never did  any of the work.  She showed up  40 minutes late  for the appointment.  I was panicking,  and I just was like,  fuck it,  just do this font,  please.  And I regretted it.  Where were you going to  that you needed  a permanent tattoo  that quickly?  Why wouldn't you  at that point  just leave and go,  okay,  it doesn't feel right.  It takes a week.  It was...  Because it was impulsive  and it was stupid.  It was a bad decision. 
[02:25:30]  And you weren't fucked up?  No, no, no.  How much did she  charge you for that?  Like a hundred bucks.  See, you're trying  to be a skinflint.  You're trying to save money.  Are you a cheapskate?  No, it's a nice shop  that she works at.  I can't name it  because it's going to  sound slanderous  or whatever,  but it's a nice shop.  They work on a lot  of reputable people,  I'd say.  So was it she knew  they were breaking  her in with you?  No, she just  fucking didn't do  what the fuck  she was supposed to do.  You know, like...  Would you tolerate  that, Troy?  No.  Look at Troy's letters 
[02:26:00]  on taking care of business,  just like Elvis had.  Troy, do you have  one bad tattoo on you?  I have a couple  shitty ones on my legs  that I got when I was a kid.  But look at the work  on Troy.  Yeah, well this guy  is just insane.  I had to book this appointment  for last September  for like now.  This guy,  Justin Weatherholtz  at Kings Avenue.  He's awesome.  Is he that?  He's a year out?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  But I knew I was going  to do my forearm,  so I wanted him to do it.  How much did that cost,  that blue hand?  It just...  I did it all like...  It's basically like  $200 an hour  and I just paid for...  I've had it paid off  for a while, so...  So wait a minute. 
[02:26:30]  You had to book...  What's his name?  Justin Weatherholtz.  He's really great?  He's amazing.  Yeah, he's at Kings Avenue  Tattoo here.  Do people know him?  He's getting a big name  for himself, yeah.  He's on Instagram.  You can check out  his work on it.  People have to book  a year in advance?  Yeah.  I should get a tattoo.  You should.  He would hook it up  for you, too.  He would take care of you.  Really?  Yeah.  What's that?  No, it can't  in Fort Myers.  What kind of tattoo  would Jim Norton get?  I don't know.  Something really cool.  Like maybe...  An Aussie tattoo?  Yeah.  I thought.  But without the disdain.  An Aussie tattoo?  Yeah, that was very... 
[02:27:00]  That was Rochester loathing.  You hear that?  An Aussie tattoo?  Tattoo.  That sounded like  Kensington to me.  Yeah, she was right.  I'd probably get  like a fucking eagle  flying over a sun.  Fuck yeah!  Fuck yeah!  See, I could do that one.  Fucking piety devil.  Fuck yeah!  Devil giving a thumbs up.  What?  You fly sometimes.  I know.  That big delicious cock's  about to spill out  into some lucky mouth.  I add you to the list  of people that have  failed the test.  That's right.  Why are you looking  at my crotch, Joe DeRosa?  How do you miss it?  Because you went up  and then the fucking 
[02:27:30]  buttons are flaring.  I get lazy.  You get the button flies.  I button most of them.  Is this really that bad?  Really?  It's kind of bad, Joe.  Compared to Troy Kwan?  Yeah.  How about we do that?  We'll get both of you guys  some followers on Twitter today.  No.  Both of you put your arms out.  No, I know.  I know it's going to get trash.  Look, the guy that I went to  is actually very, very good.  In his defense,  he didn't have a lot  to work with here  because he wanted to do  a framing around it  and everything.  I was like,  don't.  I just want to keep it streamlined,  very simple.  But there's nothing in that 
[02:28:00]  that says the guy's good.  No, it's not good.  Huh?  Well, I mean,  he didn't do this part.  He just put lines on it.  You know?  That's what I asked him to do.  Explain the new one.  You still have it.  You're avoiding it.  This is a lot of different things.  This is still healing, too.  This is a lot of different things.  This is sort of a tribute  to bad religion.  It's a symbol  to mean agnostic.  It's sort of my concept  on life  of kind of not believing  in a lot of things,  not subscribing  to a lot of things.  It sort of just means  a bunch of different things.  See? 
[02:28:30]  Troy's shaking his head, though.  Look at this.  What?  What?  It's your tattoos.  Why don't you like this one?  Get to say, Troy.  It's okay.  I'm not going to be offended.  I mean,  they're just not my thing,  but they're very basic.  You go for a very basic tattoo.  And you light skin tone,  so you can have  real nice color.  I know,  but the problem is  you have a much,  much,  much nicer body  than I do.  So when you went,  like,  color and stuff on me,  it was red,  and it looked like nicer,  and then it just doesn't look right. 
[02:29:00]  Like,  I look better with just...  It looked like Ghostbusters.  Tell everybody why.  That's why.  So it wasn't that  it didn't look nice.  People thought his statement  about atheism  was a Ghostbusters tattoo.  It's obsessed with Ghostbusters.  Joe's trying to make  a social statement,  and they think it's a fucking  giant marshmallow movie reference.  And they're just thinking  about Ray Parker Jr.  boom, boom, boom, boom.  That's why.  I like Ghostbusters, too.  Exactly.  Your pale palette of a body  is perfect, Joe.  You got a kitten tattoo  and a Ghostbusters tattoo.  Exactly.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:29:30]  I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry.  Redo it.  Redo it.  You could redo all that.  They're not beyond repair.  If he likes it,  then fuck it.  He doesn't like it.  He hates them.  This is the conversation  he has in the mirror.  It's like an old school  fucking microphone.  It's not.  Well, what do I do with this?  I told you what to do with it.  Exactly.  Lock your arm off.  And then have it removed.  I don't have it removed.  No fucking way.  I've at least lightened it  and then do something  over top of it.  Why do you get a picture  of Carlin's face tattooed?  What does the kitten mean?  Like, what is that? 
[02:30:00]  It was a George Carlin quote.  I met George Carlin.  He said,  keep kicking them in the nuts.  And then that's why  there's a microphone  kind of around it.  So why wouldn't you do  like a cool,  maybe like a Carlin portrait  and maybe have like  a banner underneath it  that said that  or something like...  Yeah, why not?  I didn't think of that.  The look on Joe's face  is like just the classic  like,  oh, I wish I had thought of it.  Oh, man.  How about you?  You want to make a statement?  How about you have  shit, piss, cunt, fuck,  cocksucker, motherfucker  and tits tattooed on your phone?  Because he said that to me. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, he did.  He probably said that to everybody.  He did.  No, that was his advice.  He never said that to me.  We had a real conversation.  But to you,  keep kicking him in the nuts.  He didn't know what you did.  But yeah,  you could have done  like a cool banner.  How long did you talk to him?  I talked to him  for like seven minutes one day  He was on my friend's radio show  and I called up.  I was like one of the only callers  because nobody listened to the show.  And I talked to him about comedy.  I said,  you're my idol.  He said,  you should have done it  with a phone  instead of a microphone.  Because he talked to him  on the phone. 
[02:31:00]  Exactly.  That would make more sense.  You had to get a picture of you.  You had to have yourself  tattooed sitting by a window  staring at it on the phone.  Or you should take  an old school telephone  and strangle yourself.  Joe,  we don't mean to go down this road  every time you're here.  Yeah,  but you got your work.  We really don't mean to do this.  It's fine.  I even say to myself,  just be nice to the guy today.  It's hard though,  isn't it?  It is.  Because you were shaking your head  like,  what the fuck is that?  I know what you were doing. 
[02:31:30]  There's something that  for some reason  doesn't feel mean about it.  I don't know why.  Okay, good.  Because I don't want it  to come across mean.  I really don't.  Because I really like you.  It's not.  And you know that.  It makes me laugh genuinely.  But like,  here's the thing is,  honestly,  Troy,  without,  be honest,  without going for a joke,  I'm not saying you've been  going for a joke,  but I'm really asking this.  No, he hasn't.  Do you really,  like,  do you really think  this is irreparable  other than just  getting it removed  in your opinion?  Because to me,  I don't give a fuck  if anybody gets it or not. 
[02:32:00]  I don't like people  asking me what it means.  I don't like talking about it.  It's there for me.  So if it can just look like  an interesting  sort of abstract design  on my arm,  that's all I care about.  Joe,  can I,  can I,  I just got some  intel.  Good, good.  From the great  Eric Nagel.  What?  The great Eric Nagel.  I don't care about that.  He just texted me,  is this real?  Yeah, it's real.  George Carlin  signed a picture  for the great  Eric Nagel,  also known as E-Rock.  What's it say? 
[02:32:30]  Hey, Eric,  kick him in the nuts.  George Carlin  says,  keep kicking him  in the nuts.  Yeah,  I know he,  that was his thing  that he said to everybody.  Yours just says,  kick him in the nuts.  But can you imagine  if you had that,  then you could have  tattooed the whole  statement on your arm  that he wrote out.  He,  before I got the tattoo,  I watched an interview  where they said,  what advice do you give  young comedians?  And he said,  I always tell them,  keep kicking them.  I knew that he said  that to everybody.  But Eric's not  a young comedian.  What do you want for me?  I knew what I was  getting into.  It wasn't like I was like, 
[02:33:00]  that was my special  moment with George.  I knew that that's.  He said the same thing  to you as he did  to the guy that likes  Legos.  Exactly.  Did you just want a tattoo  and you're like,  all right,  this works?  Or did you really  think about it?  Coke floats.  No,  I thought about it.  In his cup.  Did they put like  the outline on it  before they did it  and you still went  through with it?  No,  the outline came later  after the abuse  that he got from everybody.  Listen,  I'll take a trashing  from you,  you,  and you,  not from these two.  Well,  it's a fair chance.  I have to use  to take these girls 
[02:33:30]  that just walked out  of the study hall  to answer phones  over here.  It's a fair question.  The girls know.  I got a tattoo  and I thought about it  for at least a year.  And they're co-hosting today.  I was on the back.  Wow,  you went for a big tramp stamp.  Right over the hiding.  From my grandmother.  I thought about it  for a while.  Wait,  turn around.  Let's look at that.  Yeah,  it's nice.  That's a big tramp stamp.  Yeah,  it's good.  It's a bunch of birds  and fucking...  What is what they call them?  Carrots?  What are they sitting on?  That's from your grandma?  That's from my grandmother,  yeah.  I got her initials  down on the bottom.  Where's the initials?  I didn't see the initials.  Oh,  I thought she did the tattoo. 
[02:34:00]  What's the initials?  LBM.  LBM?  Oh,  I'm not even going to talk about that.  It's good work, though.  Thank you,  Grandma.  Did you go to Weezer's shop?  Yeah,  LBM right over the thing.  That could stand for  long bowel movements.  This is before Weezer's.  It's a good tattoo.  My grandmother's more proud  than your grandmother.  You're just saying  that that's a good tattoo.  Wow,  she's getting pissed.  What happened?  My grandmother's more happy  than your grandmother  by your tattoo.  Oh,  the Rochester claws are coming out.  Guess what never happened  to my grandma?  She never had a load 
[02:34:30]  drizzled over her  getting fucked on each time.  And by the way,  and that's not true,  Joe,  she did.  And not by white men.  Wow,  Joe.  What?  They're our co-host today.  I'm just joking.  It's all right.  I'm just joking.  You're a friend  who passed away,  grandma.  But your grandmother  passed away?  Too far.  My grandma's dead too.  Yeah,  but that was different.  She deserved it.  Wow,  that went too far,  Joe. 
[02:35:00]  They're just trying  to learn radio.  They're just trying  to have fun,  tease your tattoo.  Have a little fun.  Welcome to the playing field.  You're a seasoned comic.  What are you doing?  They're just trying  to learn about radio.  Exactly.  Why don't you try  to help them out?  This is divide and conquer.  This is what he does.  This is what he does.  This is what Bill talks about.  He pushed me  to say that mean thing  about your tattoo  and now he's going to go,  it's so mean  and he's instigating you  to say mean things to me.  Don't give away my tricks. 
[02:35:30]  I got tricks.  Yeah.  Listen,  in all honesty,  can you take that statement back?  It's fine.  But here's the thing.  Can you take back  the load thing?  That was a little too far.  Yeah,  load drizzled.  You don't have to.  It's a job.  Drizzled.  Drizzled.  That implies  that somebody  was actually just  pumped in there  and the load  was drizzling.  Just falling out  of the penis.  Yeah,  drizzling.  That's a better way  to fucking put that.  All right,  shooting jizz.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Like,  I would probably get,  I would probably get 
[02:36:00]  welcome to the  Jim Norton show,  everyone,  on my arm.  Why would you get that?  Because if we want  things that George Carlin said,  like,  why wouldn't I get that?  I don't understand.  Oh,  it's the sketch we did  for Tough Crowd.  Oh.  Jimmy really didn't  want to mention it.  At the end of the sketch  where I interrupt,  I interrupt and I say,  I love the seven dirty words  that you never can hear  on television.  He goes,  you want to hear  seven more dirty words  you'll never hear  on television?  Welcome to the  Jim Norton show,  everyone.  That's really funny. 
[02:36:30]  Oh,  it was great.  Then he called me  and Colin  cocksucking motherfuckers  and that ended the sketch.  It was really delightful.  You should have got  that on your arm.  No.  Funny,  not on the phone.  It was in front  of a studio audience  where George was dressed  like a priest  and I was dressed  like an altar boy.  He said so much stuff to us,  I wouldn't even know where,  I don't have enough room  on my body  for George Carlin tattoos.  We had him on,  I think,  Cape Fear.  Dude,  we had him on three times.  Wow.  Beautiful mind  on my back.  He was on three times  at least twice.  I was in with him once. 
[02:37:00]  I was only in with him once.  And he would do an hour  every time.  Like,  it was nothing.  Oh,  what happened?  Oh,  Joe called that?  Why don't you make that  into a tattoo?  No,  you should have that  whole radio conversation on.  So it should be,  you're calling number five  and then keep checking him  in the nuts.  Oh,  Joe.  This was worth  the drive-in today.  Joseph.  What do I do?  Now wait,  Troy never answered  the question.  Now,  I think you get  some cool tattoos.  If that was it 
[02:37:30]  and whatever,  would you look at it  and go,  oh,  that's bad  or we just go,  it just does nothing for me.  I don't even get the point.  I mean,  it's just black outline  and there's nothing.  What's that?  Don't hold back.  From one to ten,  is that a good tattoo?  Tell the truth.  You help me.  But honestly,  from one to ten,  rate that tattoo.  Look,  it's your tattoo.  If it means something to you,  it means something to you.  I think you could have done  something a little more  creative with it.  He offered to do  something much more creative  and I was like,  it's too elaborate.  I can't do it.  No,  what did he offer to do  besides cover everything  that you have? 
[02:38:00]  He was like,  look,  he was like,  why don't we just put,  and he put like a design  and colors and stuff around it  and kind of framed it.  It was just too,  it's too much.  I like like,  okay,  things that look classic  and like very streamlined.  So instead you went  with a classified FBI document.  Like they were covering up  a word that we're not allowed  to fucking look at anymore.  You should let Mike  cover that.  Yeah,  you really should.  Or any guy cover that.  It looks like a fucking  barcode.  You're buying an arm. 
[02:38:30]  There you go.  Yeah,  I don't know.  I mean,  I don't know what  I would get it covered with.  Anything.  Anything at this point.  But the problem  is there's so much black.  Yeah,  I mean,  you gotta go darker  and bigger.  Yeah,  that's the thing.  I don't want to  goddamn,  you know.  Then get it lasered.  I've seen better work  carved into a tree.  But he still  didn't answer my question.  Yeah,  that's why  you had to get a heart.  Would you look at it  and go,  that's a bad tattoo?  Or would you look at it  and just go,  I don't get the point of that?  Because there's a difference  in those two statements. 
[02:39:00]  But see,  I worked in a tattoo shop  for many years.  So I'm very judgmental  with people's tattoos.  I would not like that tattoo.  I personally wouldn't  understand it.  I think the tattoo  is so bad  that it's not even  open for discussion.  Yeah.  Oh,  I'm serious.  Stop it.  I'm serious,  Joe.  It's not.  Especially because  Troy's in here.  Troy's got some  really amazing pieces  on his arm.  Troy has fucking  Michelangelo  working on his arm.  Yeah,  I'm not a tattoo guy,  but I mean,  you've got to respect that.  That's some good work 
[02:39:30]  right there.  Troy's a work  on his arm.  Actually,  and I don't really  give a fuck about tattoos,  but his stuff is,  I actually walk in  and just go like,  fuck that,  it's great work.  It's incredible,  but that's also  Troy's personality.  That kind of stuff,  that's not who I am.  No,  it doesn't have to be  your personality.  Your personality is dull?  Yeah.  That's boring,  dull.  You're not though,  Joe.  Black and white.  It could be something,  it could be simple.  I understand what Joe wants.  He wants to go for simple.  He's not looking for,  Ozzy has thanks  tattooed in the middle  of his palm.  It doesn't have to be  a fucking genius tattoo.  All right,  so what would you do  with that?  I would cover it  and start over. 
[02:40:00]  I would laser it off.  Fuck that.  And put a little bit of,  so what,  you fucking get it numbed  and you deal with it.  But you can laser  just part of it off.  All you can do  is lighten it up.  Yeah.  And then you could,  if you like,  kick them in the nuts  if that means something to you,  get a cool banner  that says it,  get like a silhouette  of a microphone,  you could do a portrait  of George Carlin,  you could do,  there's so much you could do  with that idea,  but it doesn't have to just be,  you know,  kind of like,  I don't even know.  It's like,  it's like,  like,  like Auschwitz victims 
[02:40:30]  had like the numbers  tattooed on them like that.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Maybe you can get a picture  of Oscar Schindler.  Or a little red dress.  I did think about like,  getting this turned into  some kind of,  like if you,  if you sort of  did a stained glass,  like if you took the lines here  and added more lines with it,  you could do it  and make it even more confusing  and not even know  what's going on.  Yes.  That does not look  like a microphone.  A stained glass?  What is it?  What are you doing, Joe?  You're fucking coming apart  at the seams.  This could be a blob  on your arm. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I could put a hat  on every letter  so they look like  fucking people  in the 50s.  Oh, god damn it.  I like it.  All right.  You don't like it.  I did until 20 minutes ago.  Why are you hiding  all your tattoos now?  I felt great about it.  This one's getting trashed.  Well, it's Ghostbusters.  Yeah, I mean.  You would think by now,  you know,  Iraq would have snuck  in a little Ray Parker.  He's busy in there  fucking looking  at his Ultimate Warrior picture.  I know. 
[02:41:30]  Did he get  an Ultimate Warrior picture?  Not only did he not get one,  Roland went out of his way  to get one  just so he could text it to Eric.  Oh, you didn't go  to the big interview, Eric?  What happened  with Ultimate Warrior?  He's dead.  Sam got to...  He's been dead forever, though.  He's not dead.  He's been alive.  The Ultimate Warrior's dead.  The original guy died.  I just talked to him yesterday.  He did die.  Probably fucking six years ago.  All right, well,  then maybe I should go  get an In Memoriam tattoo.  No, the new Ultimate Warrior  is alive.  The second guy,  the original guy died. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, I probably won't get  my wrestling information  from you.  Listen, there's two things  I know.  Sam wrestling and tattoos.  Wait a minute.  The fucking Ultimate Warrior  died, man.  He didn't die, Joe.  The Ultimate Warrior  is alive.  I talked to him yesterday.  What's he do now?  The Ultimate Warrior.  He licenses himself out.  He does signings.  Who died then?  Lots of people are dead.  Yes.  Hopefully you're a tattoo artist.  I knew this was coming, 
[02:42:30]  by the way.  Why?  To photograph your fucking ankles?  I knew this was fucking coming.  What happened?  Oh, this fucking horrible...  Like a doll foot.  Fucking DeRosa has  like an awful doll...  What does that look like?  Those terrible fucking sneakers.  Wait, let me see your sneakers.  You said they look like  Gilligan shoes last time.  Ah, they're vans.  God, guys.  Jesus Christ.  Can I fucking sit  for two minutes?  It's more your ankles  that bother me, 
[02:43:00]  not the pants.  I think the shoes are fine.  I like the shoes.  The tattoo's not good.  Yeah, maybe you can get  a pair of sneakers tattooed.  I like your tattoo.  Thank you very much.  Come on.  Can I ask the lady something?  Sure.  Yes, you may.  You know that Jeff Bridges  is in a movie  with Ryan Reynolds.  I know, I heard.  I'm very jealous.  Did you get a picture  of Jeff Bridges?  No, I didn't.  He was sitting  in Travis's office  with the door shut.  What do you think  of Ryan Reynolds?  I'm in love with Ryan Reynolds.  He was here once.  Was he?  Yeah.  I'd marry him in a heartbeat.  Really?  Said he's married  to Blake Lively.  And you have a fellow.  She's so hot. 
[02:43:30]  You can't marry him.  You have somebody.  You can't cheat  with Ryan Reynolds.  Is that your one?  Actually.  Oh, that stupid bit.  I love Ryan Reynolds.  What's yours?  And then you go  around the room.  Who would your wife  let you just have  one night with?  And then you always  creep everybody out  and you just name a child.  That's my pass.  That's my pass.  Is this?  Shut up.  Who's the best chick?  Who's the chick in Hollywood 
[02:44:00]  that you would  any just,  you would just give anything?  Probably Scarlett Johansson.  Yeah.  Really?  I think she's the sexiest, yeah.  That's a biggie right there.  She's juicy, man.  Fucking love her.  Yeah, she's great.  She's great.  She's great.  She's fucking hot.  Mine used to be  Marissa Tomei, but  Oh my God.  Really?  She's a little,  I mean,  I don't think she's old.  I could never come  just thinking of  Paws Attraction  at fucking  My Cousin Vinny.  Paws Attraction?  Paws Attraction  on the cars. 
[02:44:30]  Fucking Scarlett Johansson's  pretty goddamn hot though, man.  She's fucking juicy.  Her fucking leg.  She's like a woman, man.  Oh, she felt fantastic.  Mine used to be  Drew Barrymore,  but I guess that dates me.  She's still hot though.  There was a time  she was ridiculously hot.  Alicia Silverstone  for me was one of the ones  I liked her.  I thought she was really sexy.  She was as ripe as a god  at one point.  Remember how hot  Liv Tyler was?  Oh my God.  Oh yeah.  She was like  I would say I was never,  like look at Scarlett Johansson's 
[02:45:00]  ass.  She has his juicy  pale ass cheeks.  Oh, and I fucking spank her.  It's very naughty.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Fucking.  Her breasts are bud-like too.  Oh, they're fucking heavy.  They got nice buds.  Sorry, girls.  That's probably what she said.  She probably puts them  in your face  and says suck my weighty bosoms.  That looks bud-like.  That's like something  Judi Dench would say.  Yeah, you're probably right.  Like early spring.  Those buds  that come in.  Remember,  back in the day  when Madeline Stowe 
[02:45:30]  was just fucking righteous.  I loved Madeline Stowe.  Wait, give me a picture  of Madeline Stowe.  She was in  for Unlawful Entry  with fucking Michael.  Ray Liotta.  Ray Liotta.  I want to be wrong, Joe.  Madeline Stowe  was very fucking right.  I got to see a picture.  I'm just laughing  at the name.  Yeah, she was good.  Oh yeah, she was always  ridiculously sexy.  Not so much right there.  That's her now.  Go back a little bit.  She's like 50.  No, she still looks alright.  I would still fucking  suck her toes.  She was lovely.  The white dress one  is like her  and that's like  prime Madeline Stowe. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, she was hot  and she's got a great body.  Her,  Barbara Hershey  was fucking smoking.  Who else,  Jill Claiborne?  What do you mean?  What's wrong with me?  You come up  with the strangest names.  What?  You're with me  for fucking Madeline Stowe.  You're not with me  on Barbara Hershey.  Let's go farther back.  No, Hershey is...  No, I don't think.  No, that's her now.  No, I know,  but I remember her  from...  Nah.  Beaches?  Nah, that's a beach.  She's lying on that deathbed. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, who else?  Charo?  Who else?  Charo.  Who else, Jill?  Give us one more.  Fucking...  Who else from back in the day?  Fucking...  Susan Sarandon  was great.  She sucks.  Jesus Christ.  Another bra  that was always overrated.  I wouldn't even let her  jerk me off  after Rocky Horror.  She was fucking terrible.  Goldie Hawn  back in the day?  Maybe.  I would maybe  eat her box  after seems like old times.  Oh, Jesus.  Seriously.  What's wrong with eating box, Joe? 
[02:47:00]  Huh?  Pardon my language.  But I mean,  maybe...  You tell me you wouldn't have been...  She's cute.  In Private Benjamin,  she was cute.  Hang on, hang on.  You're right, you're right.  Her daughter's way hotter.  How about the sergeant  in Private Benjamin?  Yeah, fucking Eileen Bremis.  Yes.  We met...  That's not...  No, that's a comedy.  No, Eileen Bremis  is a comedian, I know.  Her name is similar to that.  It is Eileen something.  Wait, I met Kate Hudson  in Boston, me and Ann.  We're doing a broadcast up there.  Jimmy, you went to that one?  I did.  Well, I was with Chris Robinson.  Chris Robinson, 
[02:47:30]  and I said the douchiest thing  after meeting her.  Who'd you meet?  Kate Hudson.  Oh, she saw her.  She was in her early 20s,  and I said,  she's like an angel.  God, you fucking quiz.  I've never lived that down.  You fucking quiz.  Ew, did you say that?  Yeah.  And we were all excited  because we were drinking beers,  and she goes,  guys, can I have one?  And then we almost all came.  That would be douchey  even if she was dead with wings.  I know, I know.  I'm going to throw myself  under the bus, too.  Eileen Brennan.  I said,  she's like an angel. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, my God.  Terrible.  I can't look at the girls.  Terrible.  Even if she played  for the angels.  I can't look at the girls.  Toby, did time stop  when you saw her?  Oh, God.  I saw her in my house.  It was the worst, Joe.  Did time stop long enough  for you to take a loan  across your bed?  It was so bad.  It was fucking horrible.  Who else was good  back in the fucking day, dude?  Well, the day you're talking about  is obviously the early 70s.  Exactly.  Look at the 80s and 90s.  This is the 80s and 90s. 
[02:48:30]  How old is,  which one is this again?  Barbara Hershey.  How old is Barbara Hershey?  Barbara Hershey was like  fuckable in 1976.  That's when you want to fuck her.  I don't think she was.  Come on.  Beaches was like 87.  How old is Barbara Hershey?  Barbara Hershey's 65 years old.  She stinks, Joe.  That's pretty much the 70s.  She's a fucking old lady.  Yeah, you know the way I like it.  Barbara Hershey can fucking  go jump in a lake.  She's too old.  Helen Mirren.  Joe likes old broads.  I'd bang Helen Mirren right now.  Nah, I would say.  I mean, it's.  No, I mean old broads. 
[02:49:00]  It's like Helen Mirren old.  After Caligula, I'd bang her.  She made out at 60.  How old was she again, Joe?  60.  Ew.  How old is that?  60-year-old.  Ew.  And this is a few years back now, too.  How old were you, Joe?  We know where the Drizzled the Load reference came from.  How old were you?  28.  Oh, Joe.  Who was she?  She was some lady.  She came to a show.  That's by the way, never how you want to start a pussy story.  She was some lady.  And I think he's pumping down the number, too. 
[02:49:30]  How old was she really?  I think she was 60.  What happened?  A little older, I bet.  I would not deflate the number.  The number only makes the story even better.  You were in a hospital.  She was vomiting outside the chemo ward.  What happened?  Yeah, what if she was lying?  What if she was older?  She came to a show with a butt.  She was an airline stewardess.  Oh, no.  She was an airline stewardess.  An old airline stewardess?  You know she had corns on her feet.  She was standing all the time.  She had an Eastern Airlines hat on. 
[02:50:00]  I worked for Braniff when they started, honey.  Oh, Joe.  Oh, fucking terrible.  All the fucking abuse from takeoff and landing that body has taken.  How bad were the hands when she was jerking you off?  Decades of takeoff and landing.  Her body was terrific.  She probably had some work done, but her body was really nice, actually.  I didn't have sex with her.  We just kind of made out outside of a bar.  Did she jerk you off?  She grabbed my dick over the pants.  We were against the wall in front of a bar.  Why didn't you take her to the car or something? 
[02:50:30]  I didn't have a car.  I was in New York.  You threw a 60-year-old broad up against a wall?  She was into it, dude.  Classy dame like that.  She's fucking into it.  Here's the funny part.  She's good.  I was going to go with back.  She went hip.  It was much better.  We heard her.  Here's the funny part.  Here's the funny.  Well, not the funny part, but whatever.  I had just signed with my first manager.  I remember he came to meet me at the bar.  I was out with her.  The first thing my manager ever saw me do was make it out.  Oh, awful.  They tried to get you an audition for Harold and Maud. 
[02:51:00]  The remake of Harold and Maud on Broadway.  Yeah, so she just came in with a bunch of other stewards.  60-year-olds.  It really sounds like a story from the 50s.  Oh, that's funny.  She went home and fucked Sully Sullenberger.  How terrible is that?  Wow.  And they were all single, and I went after her.  Of course they were.  And she was like, what are you doing?  These chicks are like 22 years old.  And I was like, nah, I want to hook up with you. 
[02:51:30]  I wanted to see what it was like.  I wanted to take some time.  It was very turned on by the idea of she was so much older.  I think it's admirable.  No, old lady breath would drive me crazy.  She didn't have it.  You know what an old lady's mouth tastes like when you kiss them?  It's just like old shit.  I wouldn't mind a woman a little older than me.  But even I'm at 44 now, I don't even like them in my age group, much less fucking older.  But 60, they can fuck off.  But here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  She was Helen Mirren 60.  She wasn't 60.  So at least give me that much in the story. 
[02:52:00]  I understand that.  Helen Mirren, I met once, and she was very pretty for an older woman.  For a woman that age, I get the attraction to her, but I just couldn't do it.  All the history and the fucking charm bracelet and the gray.  Oh, it would drive me nuts.  It would drive me nuts.  And you know there's gray hair in weird places.  Oh my God, yeah, leg hair.  That she just can't get to anymore.  Did she take out her teeth before or put them in a...  Whoa.  No.  Yeah, she kissed you.  You gonna let her do that?  Nailed it.  Nailed it.  Shut your motherfucker. 
[02:52:30]  You gonna let her do that to you?  You're all fucking family's rats.  You're all fucking rats.  Did you kiss her rats?  You really tried to do fucking goodfellas on her.  No, no.  You know what an old lady's sweat tastes like on her neck?  Remember you kissed your grandmother on her fucking cheek?  The old lady's sweat?  Did she taste like that?  No, no.  She was as hot as you could be for 60 years old.  Exactly.  She's not.  She's not at all.  I tried to...  I'd rather fuck a 40-year-old guy.  No shit.  I tried to open kiss my grandma once. 
[02:53:00]  I didn't know that.  Why?  I didn't know any better.  And then she told me to close my mouth.  Yes.  And then get out from under her skirt.  I don't know why.  I was young.  I didn't know.  I didn't know you...  I didn't know you'd kiss your grandma, you know, differently than you'd kiss your dad.  All right.  Listen, we're going to Montreal.  We should announce this.  Next week?  Yes.  And Joe will be up there.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  Our pal Joe.  You're going to be doing our show next week, I guess.  I would love to do it.  I didn't even know you guys were going to be up there.  I know.  No one knows.  That's why we've got to finally announce it.  We like to announce five days before.  So why would we let Buzz go?  Well, it doesn't matter because we're also learning we're broadcasting from a conference  room.  So it doesn't even matter if we announce this.  That stinks.  We want to, you know, meet some people.  We have to change that.  When we hit the road, we like meeting people.  A bunch of the guys are going to be up there.  Yeah.  It's going to be two great shows next Thursday and Friday in Montreal at the Hyatt.  Bobby will be up there.  But they got us into the conference room.  Colin's going to be up there. 
[02:54:00]  Colin will be up there doing his show.  I'm doing a TV show on the 28th.  I think I'm...  Whitney Cummings is hosting it.  Oh, no.  I'm doing something that Jeff Ross is hosting.  I was going to say I thought you might have been hosting the thing I was doing.  No.  This is like the Canadian HBO show.  Whoa.  Very cool.  So we'll be up there next Thursday and Friday in a conference room.  So I don't even know why we're announcing it.  But it will be, you know, two really good radio shows.  We got to get some fans in to watch.  It really is dull just to sit in a conference room, look at fucking hotel conference walls. 
[02:54:30]  Why a conference room?  I remember years ago I went up there to see Wee's.  He was at the Montreal Comedy Festival.  He was in the middle of, I think, the lobby.  I was with you.  So people were coming and going.  It was perfect.  We want that kind of vibe.  Not a conference room.  We were off the air.  It'll be good.  It'll be like a conference.  But it'll be like a business meeting, but with a little fun, you know?  Yeah, absolutely.  No fun comes from a conference room.  I've been fired in conference rooms.  But don't they mean like it'll be like a big room with seats where they can fit a nice crowd and everything? 
[02:55:00]  They don't mean like a little fucking...  There's no crowd.  Really?  Yeah.  No, I wouldn't.  No, Joe.  It's legit.  It's a conference room.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  I know, but I'm saying I would think it would be a...  I don't...  I'm surprised that they wouldn't...  That you guys even have to take care of the crowd issue.  I would have thought that that would have been the whole fucking point was to do a show with an audience.  We've got to find a better place to broadcast.  Yeah, because for me, insurance was an issue, but I found out I'm going to be okay with that.  Sure.  Yeah.  That was good.  Oh, that's cool that you guys are being up there. 
[02:55:30]  That's exciting, man.  It's nice to...  Sounds it.  To know some...  Can I come to the conference room?  Yeah.  We'll save a seat in the conference room.  I'll be there.  We'd rather have a long table.  We can get ribbons to put outside the door.  God, what is he doing down there?  What are you talking about?  I haven't pitched in a while.  Who?  I turned over a new fucking...  Well, let's ask him.  Maybe we didn't pitch our case strongly enough.  Yeah, we need a better place.  We need to ask Gary.  And I'll ask him.  Maybe he would be willing to work with that.  Broadcasting from the Hyatt, Montreal on Thursday and Friday of next week from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. 
[02:56:00]  We're giving the comics another hour to wake the fuck up with special guest comedians stopping by.  So...  Sweet.  Finally making it into Canada.  Can I plug some shows?  Yeah, Joe.  I have to do the same thing.  I'm at Gotham Comedy Club.  This Friday and Saturday night, five shows.  Please come out this Friday and Saturday night.  You're also...  Joe is at Atlantic City at the Revel Casino, which I've never been to. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  And the...  I'd say in August.  I'm sorry.  Joe will be in Austin.  Cap City's a great comedy club.  Great room.  It's old school, man.  It's like written in block letters on the front.  It looks like it's going to be terrible until you walk in and the vibe is fucking amazing.  So why don't you like the block letters on the Rose's forearm?  Exactly.  Maybe that's what you should get.  Fucking Cap City Comedy Club.  Because nothing comes...  Nothing amazing comes after these letters.  That's basically where it fucking stops.  The period drives Jimmy. 
[02:57:00]  I have one...  I'm working with Amy and Artie Lang and Dave Attell this Saturday.  Our early show is sold out.  The late show, there might be tickets available in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  And I'll be on Leno with...  I'm going to be here tomorrow.  But I'm doing my segment.  Amy's actually a guest.  But we'll be on Leno together on...  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, I love doing stuff with Amy.  We did Jesmyn together.  Wait, what day is that?  She's just fucking hilarious.  We're going to be on Thursday night and then I fly home.  There's a huge birthday surprise planned for me Friday. 
[02:57:30]  And I'm doing the Gathering of the Juggalos this year.  Yeah, and they're coming in.  We got them in the 23rd next Tuesday, I think.  I can't wait.  They're coming in.  Oh, yeah.  What are they going to do for us?  They'll just hang out.  They're fucking idiots.  Yeah, fuck.  Yeah.  They're cool dudes, man.  They're fucking...  They're going to be very entertaining.  They're going to be fucking awesome.  You think so, right?  But they got to do shit.  No, they don't got to do shit.  You've got to be down with the clown.  I'm down with the clown.  Until you're dead in the ground?  Okay.  Family.  Fair enough.  Family. 
[02:58:00]  There you go.  They did a video where they're just plugging the Gathering of the Juggalos.  They're just kind of like being silly and kind of making little remarks about everybody.  But it's funny.  They're not dicks.  Joe, you should get a big hatchet man to cover up that silly thing you got on your arm.  Those guys were...  Oh, you did the gig.  I did the gig.  I had a story about it in my act about how it was the worst show I ever did in my life.  Why?  And I closed my first half hour specials with it.  And I got some death threats from it, actually, from some of the fans. 
[02:58:30]  But then they have an internet radio station.  Definitely fuck off.  And one of the main guy on that station, this guy, Upchuck the Clown, who was at the gig, he got my back.  He kind of got everybody to get off of me.  He was like, he's a fucking comic.  He's just joking around, man.  But, like, guy, they did not take it light.  The fans didn't take it light.  Yeah, I know this could be a nightmare of a gig I'm doing, but it's just, you know, the money is...  But at least Upchuck the Clown will be there to make sure cooler heads prevail. 
[02:59:00]  How many years ago?  I did it, um...  God, it's got to be going on eight years ago.  Oh, it was a long time ago.  This is a comedy tent.  No, so we know who you are.  We don't know who you are.  Some might, some won't.  I mean, there's a lot of hip-hop there, so I don't know if they're going to be my audience or not.  I mean...  It's not hip-hop.  It's not hip-hop.  You think of it.  Right.  No, I know.  Look, they have psychopathic records.  They've gotten a lot of bad press after the Tila Tequila, however you say her name, incident,  about the violence and substance abuse that goes on at this gathering through the years. 
[02:59:30]  What, do you want more death threats?  What's wrong with you?  No, no, I'm just...  No, no, I'm justifying...  All right.  Easy.  I'm justifying why it would probably be a good gig now.  Then all that stuff with the CIA and the FBI came out.  Jesus, Joe!  Joe!  Oh, the Juggalos were classified as officially, like, as a gang or a cult by the FBI.  Oh, come on.  They're just fucking fans having a good time.  But that was a great...  The FBI...  Classified the Juggalos as a gang, and then the Insane Clown Posse responded by saying 
[03:00:00]  they were preparing a lawsuit against the United States government for classifying their  fans as a gang.  Good for them.  My point is, is that I think after all that, they probably were kind of like, all right,  guys, like, let's keep this good thing we got going.  Sure.  Let's just tone down some of the fucking insanity that's given us this bad rap or whatever.  I would think.  I don't know.  You know?  You should get a clown tattoo.  A hatchet, man.  You gotta get a hatchet.  Yeah.  I think that's your next tattoo.  I'd love to meet those guys, because I was always curious if they ever actually heard 
[03:00:30]  the bit or not.  Well, come in when we talk to them.  But I'm afraid they'll be like, fuck you, mother...  I don't know.  They're very cool guys.  Yeah, I mean, they seem like they'd be nice.  They're very cool.  There's your tattoo.  Yeah, that could cover it.  Right there, yeah.  Just put that bullshit you have right there.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  Look at that.  Right down the body.  Oh, no.  You can write that horse shit kitten thing right here.  Right, right.  That thing that means nothing.  That stupid fucking dumb, stupid cunt thing I have that means dark shit.  Yeah.  Who's this broad? 
[03:01:00]  She's just taking our picture.  Who are you?  Who are you?  I can't hear you.  How did I come in?  She's really...  She's lovely.  Yeah.  Delightful, and she's taking pictures outside the studio.  Why are you taking our picture?  Hello.  Hi.  Why are you taking our picture?  You're very lovely.  Do you know us?  I saw a bunch of hot guys here.  That's what's up.  Nice.  That's what's up.  That's what's happening, ladies.  Who are you?  What's your name?  My name is Claudia.  Hi, Claudia.  What do you do?  I actually am a reporter. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, a reporter.  What are you reporting on?  About the All-Star Game.  Oh, okay.  Are you doing any story about really bad tattoos?  Well, ask her, Joe.  That's fair.  What do you think that...  I can totally write something about it.  Is that okay to you?  Does that look terrible?  It's healing.  It's healing.  Wait, what is this?  Kitty?  Is that Kitty?  It looks like Kitty.  Fuck the world.  Fuck everything.  You know we don't know her.  I know you don't fucking know her.  Fucking shit. 
[03:02:00]  Who do you work for?  I work for 93.9 FM in Los Angeles.  Oh, okay.  And you're just in town checking out satellite radio?  Yes.  Are you...  I'm just...  Yeah, I'm checking.  You're so hired.  Yeah, are you trying to get a job here?  No, I'm not actually, but it would be nice.  Are you going back to L.A.?  I'm going back to L.A., yes.  So why are you at satellite radio if you work for regular radio?  You'll be there tomorrow.  I actually used to work at Playboy Radio. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, okay, you did.  So what did you do?  Yeah, you did.  You had your own show?  I used to do the sports reports for the morning show in Spaniel.  When do you go back to L.A.?  Tomorrow.  I'll be there tomorrow.  You're going tomorrow?  What are you doing there?  Ah, it's just a silly thing on The Tonight Show.  Wow.  I guess I'm going to have to watch TV.  Well, if you want.  I mean, maybe you can go to the taping.  Now, how long have you had your show on Playboy Radio?  Probably like two years.  Oh, okay.  And why did you leave? 
[03:03:00]  I just wanted to try something different.  Oh, very lovely.  Are you married?  No, I'm not.  I'm single.  Are you really?  Oh, boy.  Me too.  And, you know, it's so difficult to find somebody I connect with.  Well, it is very difficult.  Oh, in L.A. especially.  L.A.?  Oh, they're all so empty and vapid out there.  I know.  You've always wanted to meet a down-to-earth gal that works in the biz, right?  Absolutely.  With a good head on her shoulders.  Somebody who's got writing skills, yes.  Let's ask her.  Do you like lunch?  Lunch?  Do you have lunch right now?  Jimmy loves lunch. 
[03:03:30]  I'm a big luncher.  I enjoy a good lunch.  I do.  Me too.  I know.  Let's do it.  All right.  Whoa.  Is that just for the radio?  Hey, girlfriend.  No, she's just shutting.  She's just...  And then I'll follow her outside and go, where should we have lunch?  And she'll go, I was just kidding.  We're on the air.  All of a sudden, she doesn't know English anymore.  Sorry.  I don't know you.  No te conozco.  I speak a little Spanish myself. 
[03:04:00]  You guys should go to lunch and talk scoops.  I can't tell you.  I have to go to the gym and I have a construction in my apartment.  How much are you lifting these days?  I don't know.  13-year-old boy question.  I was kidding.  I was...  Come on, Jesus.  No, I can't lift because I have a sore hand.  Oh, what happened?  I was doing these exercises.  You don't want to know.  Well, you've got to slow down then.  I know, but I was just going crazy.  Just trying to...  I'm really running out of steam very quickly. 
[03:04:30]  But I have this.  No, don't put your brace back on.  Why?  They got to look it out of the special tool.  Jesus, please.  Don't put that fucking Nana backgammon brace on.  I'll wear this to lunch.  You're really injured.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, I want her to think that I'm really like a warrior who got hurt.  It looks like her on his keyboard.  Exactly.  Fucking carpal tunnel.  Why would you do that in front of the hot girl?  I don't know.  I got hurt putting a thumb in from watching porn. 
[03:05:00]  So, now, did the stuff on Playboy Radio, did you see like a lot of nudity or no?  No, there wasn't.  Once in a while, we'll have like a sex expert coming in with her toys.  Oh, what kind of toys?  Just different kinds of toys.  You know, the new ones.  The new ones?  Did you take any?  Like, just, you know.  They gave us a couple.  What did they give you?  Let's try.  I got it, Jimmy.  Did you take any?  Still in the box, actually.  I haven't tried any.  Well, all right.  Well, you'll figure it out when you get back to them. 
[03:05:30]  So, you are going back tomorrow.  And what is your name before I get in trouble?  My name is Claudia.  You're very nice.  I'm Jim.  Thank you, Jim.  A very firm handshake by Claudia.  That means no lunch.  No, it means no lunch whatsoever.  That means no lunch.  Matter of fact, if we were in the airport on the same flight, I'm like, are you hungry?  And we were sitting next to each other on the plane.  She'd refuse to eat just so it wasn't a lunch.  With me.  What time are you flying back?  Five in the morning.  Why so early?  I got to go back to work. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, you got to be on the air tomorrow?  And I have my little doggie.  No, I don't do actually on-air stuff.  I write online.  Oh, you write online?  Oh, where's your column?  It should be in there, actually, if you look at the website.  Oh, okay.  98.9 in Los Angeles?  93.9.  93.9.  Why don't you guys get breakfast at the airport tomorrow?  Exitos.  Because I'll be doing this tomorrow.  Then I fly at noon.  What's the slug line for Exitos?  Lo mejor en inglés y español.  I don't know what that means.  What's that mean?  The best in English and Spanish. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, Spanglish.  We do the Spanglish thing, yes.  I understand every other word.  Does your boyfriend work for them?  She doesn't have a boyfriend.  No, she's in English.  She's not married, but she has a boyfriend.  Does your boyfriend work for the station or no?  No.  No?  What does he do?  He actually works for Fox Radio.  Oh, okay.  So he's got a job in the business.  Right, right.  And that was my way of finding out.  I'm really good.  You're sneaky.  No, I know.  I'm going to have a safe flight.  Do we know the Fox Radio guy?  What's his name? 
[03:07:00]  Do we know?  Do you want to say his name, do you?  I don't know.  Are you the one to say?  Yeah, he works in marketing.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Marketing.  Claudia, you can do so much better.  Let's let Claudia go.  Thank you very much, Claudia.  Thank you.  It was nice meeting you there.  Have a safe trip back.  Yes.  Thank you.  Lovely.  Wow.  So, single can mean...  She's fantastic.  Of course.  I just knew.  You knew, Jimmy?  Of course.  She's really sexy, though. 
[03:07:30]  You know, I wasn't that into her.  No, why would you be?  She's under 70.  Why aren't you into that?  I don't mean this to sound mean.  Some big, juicy lips.  What was wrong with her?  There was a lot of construction going on there.  There had been a lot of...  There was plastic surgery involved.  What?  Really?  Oh, I don't know about that.  I didn't pick up on that.  I didn't either.  The difference doesn't make...  She was hot.  Listen.  You don't like her because she didn't have a dick. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  That's not helping her, Claus.  She was lovely, man.  No, here's the thing.  I don't know if she's had surgery.  She doesn't look like she does.  No, I didn't notice that.  She looked like she had natural, juicy, Spanish lips.  Her whole face looked...  When your skin is that fucking smooth and shiny,  that's a fucking face.  I think she's Hispanic.  No way.  Jackie, can you back me up for once?  I just noticed the lips.  I just thought the lips were a little done,  but I didn't really look.  No.  The accent had been kind of drawn into it.  Jackie and Joe sound like jealous teenage girls. 
[03:08:30]  I'm telling you.  Which is okay for Jackie,  but not so much for Joe.  Because you got Kitty tattooed on your arm.  I like the accent is what I wanted.  I thought she was great.  The accent draws you in.  Wasn't she sexy?  She was pretty sexy.  Beautiful body.  I love Hispanic girl.  No, no, no.  But make out with her soft, beautiful lips.  Start talking in Spanish.  But that's my point.  It wasn't...  It was a very, very real thin body  with big boobs.  That's not a beautiful body.  Juicy rubble.  He's crazy.  Get the fuck out of here.  I'm not saying I wouldn't bang her.  You're talking about fucking a 60-year-old lady 
[03:09:00]  and you're going to turn that down.  Get the fuck out of here.  I agree.  I'm not saying I wouldn't...  Oh, you guys used to fight.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that.  Well, Troy knows.  No, no, no.  It's fine.  It's over.  Okay.  I forgot about that.  You're kidding me.  Hold on.  Jesus, Troy.  Get the fuck out of here.  Her ass was beautiful.  Her legs were nice and feminine.  It actually looks like your hair is standing up from anger right now.  You do that to be gentle.  Here's my...  I'm not saying I wouldn't bang her.  I'm just saying I don't think she's like a fucking 10-knockout smoking chick. 
[03:09:30]  That's all.  She was very beautiful.  How many times does just a random Hispanic girl walk in here?  And take pictures of us and then be nice and sexy.  And call you all hot.  Yeah.  She says she saw hot men in here, Joe.  You know what?  Get the fuck out of here.  I preface these statements with I'm not trying to be a dick.  I'm just saying.  But you come across as a dick.  No, I don't.  Yeah.  You guys want to hear what you want to hear.  You're mad because you said it looks like Kitty.  Exactly.  No, not me.  Yeah.  I bet if she was a fucking Pan Amp stewardess, she'd be happy to make out with her friends 
[03:10:00]  in front of the Regal Beagle.  That's some old references right there for the people that I don't know.  That's some old shit right there.  What's her face that was in here the other day?  The porn star.  Oh, uh.  What's her face?  Lexi Love.  Lexi Love.  Yeah, she's nice.  Lexi Love in the face was not as pretty as that girl was that was just in here.  But I liked Lexi Love's body better because it was proportionate.  It was proportionate.  And that girl had super high heels on. 
[03:10:30]  Burr said this to me once.  He goes, you take the heels off of most girls, the whole form of the body just goes away.  It's true.  Yeah, but that's because it makes them stand up taller.  It creates, it emphasizes the muscles and shape in the legs.  But it makes them look sexy.  Who cares?  Yeah, exactly.  Take off the high heels.  Don't fuck with their shoes on.  That's why I started this when I said there's a lot of construction going on here.  Take away the outfit and the heels and the plastic surgery.  And I don't think you got the smoke and the eye cheek anymore.  You can say that about any girl.  Take away the head and the feet.  Oh, it's right there. 
[03:11:00]  Makeup.  Who are you, the fucking Iceman?  That's right.  Put their hair up in a bun.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Take off that red shirt and the fuck out of here.  You guys are all wrong and I'm right.  No, we're not.  No.  You're not right about much, Joe.  I'm very fucking right about this.  Not girls, not tattoos.  I've seen the girls that you date.  You date way hotter chicks than that.  Yeah.  Way hotter.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean that that girl's not hot as shit.  But it does.  You're missing the point.  I'm not saying that.  I wish we had a picture to show everybody.  Did anyone take a picture of her?  She was beautiful. 
[03:11:30]  Joe, I don't know what you're talking about.  It might not be your type or whatever, but she was beautiful.  Let me ask you a question.  Fuck out of here.  You can't tell.  There's no difference in your head between, yeah, obviously I would sleep with that girl.  She's attractive.  And no, if Scarlett Johansson is a 10, that girl can't also be a 10.  No, but it was the way you started.  It wasn't like you were like, you just were like, is this just me?  Or is she like, you were hoping to give her a beating and we all think that she's lovely. 
[03:12:00]  Lovely.  She's a delight.  And she almost went to lunch with Jim Norton.  Exactly.  If it wasn't for my physical abominations, I might have had a shot at taking her for a  Cobb salad.  I swear to God.  You did it to yourself by putting the wrap on in front of her.  Oh, God.  I swear to God, I was not looking to trash her.  That's why I said I'm not trying to be a...  I swear to God.  Give her a number.  Seven.  Oh, God.  But you got...  Listen, if you're going to put...  Hold on a second.  If you're going to put Scarlett Johansson at 10, she was... 
[03:12:30]  Come on.  She's a strong seven.  Seven.  No, she's hotter than...  I would probably say an eight.  I could go eight.  Eight and a half.  Yeah, she was solid.  No way.  Sexy.  No way.  Strong.  Yeah.  No, seven.  I got a thing for Hispanics.  Very kissable.  You know what I should be to just sit on the couch and smooch?  I'd hug her back.  Give her deep kisses.  Roland, what do you think?  Seven.  Roland, come on.  Let's see here.  I should give Joe the finger behind his back.  But I'm not going to say anything, Joe.  Roland.  I'm not that type of guy.  She had a great ass, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, perfect body.  You didn't see the ass? 
[03:13:00]  Why?  Everyone else looked as you left.  I know.  What were you looking at?  Did you notice the silence?  That was her leaving so we could look at her ass.  Her accent?  She's beautiful.  Can you play back the silence, Sal?  Yeah, she was wonderful.  How would you even know that it was playing back?  Well, she goes, all right, I got to go.  And then you hear silence because we all were checking out her ass and forgot we were doing radio.  A bunch of rock-horn pricks.  All right, well, what do you want?  I don't know, guy.  She was like, I would go to lunch.  I'm very, very nice.  Yeah, she was just being polite. 
[03:13:30]  I don't really understand why she's here, though.  Probably some guy's trying to show her off.  She said she was researching for the All-Star Game.  Yeah, maybe her boyfriend's in town or something.  She's looking for a job.  Yeah, of course.  She's blogging online.  She wants to get out of L.A.  Well, maybe she was phoning for an interview and she just can't.  Of course.  Okay, I got you.  Yeah.  I mean, I could fucking hook her up.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you stay with me?  I'm having some shelving today.  That's what you do.  That's what you do.  I can't believe you didn't like that.  What is happening behind me? 
[03:14:00]  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Why don't you worry about it, bro?  What?  Fuck off.  What's happening behind me?  I think he was imitating, like, I don't know, a cat, like, covering up a turd.  Well, Roland is a...  He might have been the turd in that scenario.  I'm not really sure, though.  Look, he's covering up...  Roland's flipping you off, making gestures in his crotch, and then kicking imaginary dick.  Dirt on you.  He's shooting imaginary jizz on you for a second back.  Meaning what?  I don't even get it.  Meaning.  I don't know.  He's just doing things that are disrespectful to you.  Why is Sam crying? 
[03:14:30]  Because it's funny.  The stuff you find funny, though.  There's been a lot of funny stuff, but it's this that makes you cry?  Sam has this whole after show planned right here.  Yeah, I know.  You're saying it, right, John?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Bro.  Whoa.  Maybe.  What do you mean maybe?  I mean, if we can talk honestly.  Can we always talk honestly?  In this room for once.  Sam, can we end with Denny's drive-in movie theater story?  No.  Let's clear the field.  And make room for Denny's drive-in story.  No, I mean, let's do it now.  Yeah, that's what I mean. 
[03:15:00]  Like, right now.  I used to go there, and we would just watch the movies and not leave until it was over.  Because it's like a sheesh.  Denny has a terrific drive-in movie theater story.  Exactly.  You're like this.  Hey, while we're waiting for Denny, can you do the live read?  A joke head.  Okay.  You got the paper, though.  Where is it?  It's in front of Opie.  By now, you've probably heard about the whole home HD DVR from Dish called the Hopper.  It has a bunch of amazing features like Auto Hop, which gives you the power to skip all the commercials  from most primetime shows from the major networks. 
[03:15:30]  All you have to do is enable it once when you play back the show.  Then you can just put down the remote and skip all the commercials.  It's a great feature because when you try to fast-forward through commercials with a normal DVR,  it never really works.  Now you can finally watch your favorite shows totally uninterrupted, all the way through  from beginning to end, completely commercial-free.  So if you love watching primetime network shows but you hate watching commercials, the  Auto Hop feature is perfect for you.  It only comes with a hopper from Dish.  Watch more TV.  Watch fewer commercials.  All with a hopper from Dish. 
[03:16:00]  Call 1-800-WATCH-TV to get Dish Network today.  Plans are starting at just $29.99.  That's 1-800-WATCH-TV.  Yeah.  Remember how we listened to the radio?  And I said, that's the place to be.  That's Denny's walk-out music.  Okay.  Okay.  He always wanted to be the morning DJ, Joe.  Fell a little short.  What happened?  But he's still trying.  What happened?  Well, he admitted.  His voice is a little weak. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, he sounds like a nasally child.  A little weak.  Denny.  Stop trying to build me up.  Thank you.  What's your driving story?  I said a little weak.  We can work on that.  He's got a good voice.  A lot of good voice.  Huh?  No, and it's not a great voice.  I admit it.  I admit it's not a great voice.  It's fine.  I honestly think it sounds like a great voice.  Give him a claret and D.  It's a fine voice.  Go ahead.  Put a little processing behind that?  There you go.  See, these kids today don't know about processing.  Reverb.  Denny, I tell you, I think you have a good voice.  In my opinion, it's not been in line with the rest of this room for this whole show. 
[03:17:00]  But I tell you, I think you've got a good voice.  Thank you.  Didn't that young lady, her profile looked like Eva Mendez?  She had a little Eva Mendez to her.  Okay, can I say this real quick?  Yes.  Sorry.  Great point.  Eva Mendez is a fucking...  Why do you have to say Eva after we all said Eva?  Wait, wait, wait.  Exactly.  What the fuck?  Always have to be different.  I'm sorry.  She's a what?  She is a fucking 10.  Oh, okay.  No plastic surgery, no heels, no bullshit, no makeup. 
[03:17:30]  10 right out of the fucking box.  All right, so she's the no-frills version of Eva Mendez.  That's pretty good.  But my point was just, you can't go, who cares about the bells and whistles?  You have to.  You have to go, well, that means she's not a 10 at that point.  Instead of getting lucky charms, you get marshmallow and stars.  Troy does not agree.  Troy?  You've fallen over a girl with a penis.  Like, what does that say about your...  You mean me or Joe?  Please clarify.  But why does this disgust you so much?  Just because it just... 
[03:18:00]  That girl was insane.  But you're not hearing what I'm saying to you right now.  If Eva Mendez is a 10...  Denny, your story might have to wait.  If Eva Mendez is a 10, right out of the fresh morning, no shower, nothing.  That girl's an 8.  Come on, Troy.  Oh!  7.  I think 7's fair.  I think it's very fair.  I'm not being mean.  I think it's just a fair statement.  That's a little...  I don't understand why he makes you angry.  You get me my feathers ruffled. 
[03:18:30]  Why?  Just, I don't know.  Joe, he hasn't let go of the other thing.  Huh?  He never let go of that other thing that he said you guys are all good on.  I don't think he has.  He never let that go.  The other day when it came up, when I go, me and Troy are cool now, you know, I'm not  trying to be a fighter.  Here's what happened.  He ran into this fucking room like there was money being given away.  We were on the after show and calling Roland out on some bullshit.  And then Roland was like, well, Troy, you talk shit about Joe.  And you know what Troy's response was?  I never said I liked Joe. 
[03:19:00]  I don't think Troy likes me.  We're fine.  We're fine.  He didn't get over the other thing.  When they were fighting, I'm going to take it as a further.  I don't think Troy ever liked me.  No, never.  Even when we were like supposedly friends.  I think he was just plotting and making the fucking joke me out.  I don't know if we were ever friends.  We were pretty friendly.  We used to hang out at functions.  We're cordial.  But I mean, like when we would go to aunt's barbecues, we would sit and hang out for a  long time and talk.  We're cordial.  I would say we were friendly.  Friends are people I hang out with on a regular basis.  I would say we were, it seemed like we were on our way to potentially swapping numbers. 
[03:19:30]  And then you just, you sunk that shit.  And I hold a grudge.  I still have anger towards people I had in high school.  So like, I don't get over shit easy.  Oh, that's fine.  Now, why do you have a grudge against Joe?  What exactly did he do?  Oh, geez.  I don't know.  No, no, no.  That's not going to answer.  I'm not being combative, Jim.  I'm saying like, this is a.  It's a long thing.  It's a long story.  Yeah, it's a long story.  The short of it is, you weren't here this the one day.  I would rather build, you know, new hatred.  Yeah.  We're not going to go back to hatred.  Let's get some new hatred going.  You were out the day it happened.  I was filling in for you. 
[03:20:00]  And Troy, I started making fun of Troy's shoes or something.  And then.  And my jeans.  And by the way, you're wearing diesel jeans today.  And Van sneakers.  With rips in them that you goofed on me for.  Right.  Right.  Oh, shit.  But Troy.  You were on that shit like a year ago.  Troy, we're past it.  It's a year later, dude.  Yeah, I told you I don't let go of shit.  I've already apologized.  Because he's doing the shit that he made fun of you for.  You're going back to the ripped jeans thing.  Totally.  Wow, he never forgot.  He made fun of you for that.  I was wearing diesel jeans.  I had these in my closet when I was making fun of him. 
[03:20:30]  That wasn't the point.  That's not cool.  The point was.  Because he's making fun of him.  I mean, he does.  That's not cool.  Of course.  That don't make no sense.  That doesn't make any sense.  Thank you.  Anyway, the point is, is I made some jokes.  Troy got a little angry.  And then it carried over into an actual fight a month later when, again, you weren't here.  When you fucked with your livelihood.  Oh, I've heard about that one.  And we got in a big fight.  And then we didn't talk for a long time.  And then finally at the Caroline's Christmas party, I went up to Troy.  I said, Troy, can we just let this go? 
[03:21:00]  Oh, I was at that party.  And then he said, yeah.  And I thought everything was cool.  He never let it go.  He didn't let it go.  He said, yes, he was lying.  He lied.  He lied to you, Joe.  We're fine.  But see, the problem is, Jim starts shit back up.  Jim's taking his pants off.  Listen, I'm not going to get angry.  I'm not.  I'm not angry at you.  We're fine.  What is Jimmy doing?  He took his pants off.  I have to go to the gym directly after this.  And Troy and I still have to do something.  So while you're talking, I'm just changing.  So I don't have to do it at the gym.  I'm very pressed for time.  He put his gym sweats on. 
[03:21:30]  He's very pressed for time.  Those are the thinnest sweats I've ever seen.  They are, yeah.  They have some light sweats.  I like my cock to breathe.  He likes to show off the cock.  Yeah.  He likes it that way.  So, um, okay.  So what's happening here?  Troy still hates you.  Well, we also got, uh, Denny's, Denny's drive-in, uh, movie theater story.  It's kind of a letdown after all this.  Yeah, I don't think it's Troy's angle.  Oh, Denny, please.  Oh, I heard a preview of this thing.  It's not going to disappoint.  Wasn't that great?  I mean, you were talking about sneaking into the drive-in.  I never snuck in.  I never went. 
[03:22:00]  The first time I went to a drive-in.  Don't rub, Saul.  Well, it was when I was 20, probably 23 in Rochester, New York.  It was the first time I ever went to a drive-in.  Did you ever see a drive-in movie as a kid?  Yeah, at the Red Lights.  I told you that.  For how long?  For maybe a minute.  A minute?  But we'd get to hear the sound for a while because we'd pick up the movie before the  red light.  You never actually went in to watch it?  Oh, Joe.  Listen to the first part of today's show.  What do you want for me?  I brought up this nice, what I thought was a good childhood memory and then realized, like, 
[03:22:30]  what the fuck was wrong with my parents that we never actually went and saw a movie at  the Rocky Point drive-in.  That's hilarious.  They would just take it so you could kind of see the screen.  No, I was on the way home from my grandma's house.  Oh, drive-ins.  I missed those.  Those were the fucking best.  I wouldn't know, Joe.  You missed out.  That's the point today.  You missed out.  Mike has rubbing salt in opiate wounds.  Joe and Danny over here is a lethal combination.  But Danny, Danny can relate and has a story.  Oh, right.  I wanted to see, a bunch of buddies of mine wanted to see the movie with Foxy Brown. 
[03:23:00]  Who was that?  Pam Greer, back in the 70s.  And they all wanted to sneak in, but nobody had the money to get in.  So, like, one guy, what we did is we all chipped in, like, two bucks.  But I had to go in the trunk of, like, a 1972 Chevy Nova.  And I got claustrophobic.  And as we're driving into the entranceway, I'm banging on the thing to let me out.  And then the guy got mad from the manager and he called all our parents when they had  to come down there.  But I got claustrophobic.  It wasn't a great story.  It was just a...  Jimmy, you're missing an amazing story.  It wasn't a great story.  Still from the top, Danny. 
[03:23:30]  Jim missed it.  No, no.  It's not in here.  I had a carter phone.  It was just a thing in passing.  It's not a bad story.  It's not a bad story.  Please retell it for Jimmy.  And what song should we play over the story?  Just to bring it all together.  We have Beach Boys Driving.  Did you have Beach Boys Driving?  Yeah, that'd be great.  All right.  Let's get a little Beach Boys Driving.  And then we tell the story for Jim Norris.  It actually is a good story.  I said a bunch of buddies of mine wanted to see this Pam Greer movie, Foxy Brown or something,  back in the 70s.  Nobody had enough money for everybody in the car.  So they locked me up in the trunk of a 1972 Chevy Nova. 
[03:24:00]  I got claustrophobic, turned to sweat automatically, started banging on the trunk to get out.  But the management found out that we were sneaking guys in.  And it wasn't a big thing.  That's cool.  What did you and Patsy and Ralph Mouth do after that?  It wasn't a big thing.  It wasn't a big thing.  I wish you were locked in the trunk of Harry Chapin's car.  I would just get claustrophobic.  That is the hackiest thing to do in a driveway.  That's a terrible surfing movie.  That's a hack move to hide someone in the trunk.  But they used to do that.  You used to do that back in the 70s. 
[03:24:30]  You would do that.  That's all.  That's all I was saying.  It also would squeeze a lot of people into a phone booth.  Exactly.  That would be worse if you said you jerked off Tom Bosley.  That would be a great story.  You know who really enjoyed that story, though, was Troy Kwan.  He loved it.  I saw him last night.  I saw him.  It wasn't a big story.  Troy appreciates nostalgia.  Troy, what did you think of the story?  I was falling asleep.  It wasn't a great story.  It was just furious.  It wasn't a great story.  Troy just doesn't like fucking shoddy stories. 
[03:25:00]  I respect that.  And I admit it.  Troy likes a real story.  Making conversations.  He doesn't like Joe or Denny.  A bad drive-in story.  Troy likes a nice, solid drive-in story.  Yeah, yeah.  He needs a real punch at the end of it.  I like Troy's TCB tattoo.  Elvis taking care of business.  Denny, what was the movie?  Oh, Foxy Brown.  Foxy Brown.  Jesus Christ.  Pam Greer.  I'm looking for details that might spice it up.  I can't believe you went to see Foxy Brown.  Pam Greer.  You're going to sneak in.  You sneak in for like fucking Star Wars or some shit. 
[03:25:30]  You know, sneak in for the big summer blockbuster.  You didn't make that yet.  You got to climb the fence or something.  Exactly.  You know, a guy thought it would be fun to do and lock me in the trunk.  That's what you thought was fun?  Happens.  I didn't like it.  I didn't like being locked in the trunk.  It was zany.  We heard you.  That's all.  Jesus, God.  I told you it wasn't anything exciting.  It was a good story, Denny.  It was a good story, actually.  That literally should be the lead story on awfulstories.com.  Okay.  I don't like how Sam's sleeves are rolled up like Ray Liotta in Something Wild. 
[03:26:00]  They're just cupped.  A little cupped never hurt anybody.  Yeah.  You should have a cigarette pack rolled up in those sleeves.  Okay, so.  I thought that reference was going to do a lot more.  I never saw the movie.  Is it Jericho?  He's like a greasery kind of guy.  You get it?  My old pal.  It's there.  I'm going to bring this all the way around.  A guy I used to work with at BAB who is in the record industry.  Still doing well, even though everyone else is not.  He wrote, Harry Chapin died near Exit 40, which we figured out on the LIE near Jericho. 
[03:26:30]  He was in a blue 1975 Volkswagen Rabbit.  I guess the fuel tank ruptured by climbing its back.  Yeah.  What did he die from?  What, did he get rear-ended or something?  I think he saw climb his back probably.  All right, Rabbit.  Rupturing the blue 1975 Volkswagen Rabbit, rupturing the fuel tank by climbing its back  and causing it to burst into flames.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  So wait, was he driving the blue 1975 Volkswagen Rabbit or is that what?  He was driving the Rabbit, I believe.  Okay. 
[03:27:00]  There you go.  That's a bug, right?  The Volkswagen Bug.  No, the Rabbit was another model.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What did it look like?  It was a little, like, hatchback-type deal.  It was more of a square-type car.  Not the van.  No.  No, it was a Rabbit.  Speaking of square.  Denny?  Yeah.  He's a square.  The car was square.  Couldn't sneak somebody to the drive-in in one of those things.  Right.  How would you handle that situation?  He didn't like the drive-in story?  Denny the drive-in bandit. 
[03:27:30]  That's the raciest thing he's ever done.  Denny got beat up by greasers when he was growing up.  One time we stole rock candy out of the corner store.  The Tufts and leather jackets would beat him up.  Sneak right into the after show.  Yeah.  Well, you don't have to do this proper.  You got to do some live reads and commercial breaks.  Have fun, guys.  You got two more.  At least do one of them.  Do I?  Joe will do them.  Yeah, Joe.  He owes me.  What the for what?  You know what?  You're treating him like a rock star. 
[03:28:00]  I'll do one.  I don't care.  I'll do one.  All right.  And I'll be at Gotham this Friday and Saturday night.  Please come see that.  Bye-bye.  There you go, Joe.  We're not leaving anywhere.  We're still on the air.  Thanks, man.  It was fun.  The show is still on.  We'll do it in a week.  Yeah.  All right.  You do that one.  How did you sleep last night?

[03:30:30]  So, E-Rock, give me a sweeper and a bed.  The O.P. and Anthony Show continues, sort of, after O&A Live with Sam Roberts.  It's next.  There you go.  This is After O.P. and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  This is After O.P. and Anthony Live. 
[03:31:00]  This is After O.P. and Anthony Live.  Wow.  Joe DeRosa's sticking around for After O.P. and Anthony Live.  He's been having a tattoo help the entire commercial break.  Are you at the moment?  Like, I've always been afraid.  Like, I got...  With my tattoos, because I got Jack White's autograph, Rob Zombie's autograph, and then I got a white zombie logo from I got when I was in college. 
[03:31:30]  You could say you like them or don't like them, but they're just what they are.  Right.  You know what I mean?  So, there's no real, like, right or wrong decision to make, because the guy signed my arm.  The guy just texted me.  I told you he's a fan.  I bet you he heard the show.  Yeah.  Let me know if the tattoo heals up, I guarantee.  All my work for a while.  That can't be a coincidence.  That's got to be that he's listening to the show.  Yeah, because Joe's got this tattoo, and it says, 
[03:32:00]  It's K-K-T-I-T-N, which stands for Keep Kicking Him in the Nuts, which is what George Carlin told him and every single other person that he met.  But I knew that.  Okay.  Because, listen to the thing, Bobby Kelly.  He did.  Yeah.  Bobby Kelly made fun of me for that.  He's like, he fucking said to everybody, and I'm like, I know.  That's why I got it, because I was like, this is what he told people, and he told me, too.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  Like, I thought that that was kind of what made it cool. 
[03:32:30]  I told you over the phone.  Yeah.  That's a little more embarrassing.  When you revealed today on the show that your encounter with George Carlin was because you called the radio show that he was on.  Well, hold on.  That's a little less than, like, I met him at the cellar one night, and we talked comedy.  I called my friend's radio show at NYU.  It wasn't like I called, like, whatever in fucking Minneapolis or whatever.  It was a college radio show.  I called, it was like calling into your friend's podcast and talking to George Carlin.  So there's that.  There's also the fact, too, that, I mean, I would have rather, I'm glad I met him like that versus in person, because if I met him in person, I probably would have talked to him for 30 seconds. 
[03:33:00]  I got to talk to him for seven fucking minutes in a scenario where he was there to talk to people.  Did he tell you anything besides what he tells everybody else?  Oh, my God.  He gave me tons of advice.  Well, why wouldn't you get some of that advice tattooed on your arm?  Because it wasn't anything, it wasn't a phrase.  I wanted to pay tribute to him.  And make it simple.  Make it something that, just like that, there's the tribute.  Yeah, and I picked, this is how the problem started with this tattoo.  I picked the wrong font. 
[03:33:30]  If I picked a better font, it would have been fine.  But I picked the wrong font, and I got the stupid period put at the end of it.  I fucked up.  Honestly, I know Jim hates the period.  I don't even mind the period.  Because I think the period is like, you know, like, it makes it, this is, this is a thought.  Yeah, I know.  That's what a lot of people said to me.  But I never liked the period.  It looked too like, period.  Yeah, it is a little like that.  I didn't like it.  But I picked a bad font.  I picked a font that was too aggressive and hard looking.  Yeah, it is. 
[03:34:00]  It almost looks like a Roman numeral type font.  It's very, yeah.  So then, and actually, that's what we were going to do, was just keep it with the line,  so it almost looked Roman numeral-ish.  And then I was like, ooh, where do we put the mission?  It's my fault.  So what Joe did was, he went to his tattoo guy and had them add a rectangle around the initials.  Right.  And then just add a little bit more to the rectangle and make the top look slightly meshy.  And then he said it's a microphone, which I was like, Joe, I don't have any problem with you. 
[03:34:30]  But I'd never seen any type of microphone like that.  Like, microphone was literally the last thing I would have thought of.  Like, I would have thought that that was a dog before a microphone, and it doesn't look anything like a dog.  There's no legs, there's no tail, no ears.  I fucked up.  And that's what crushed me, is when I saw your face today, it's like, that realization that, oh shit, I just got a bad tattoo.  Like, I don't know what that's like, because I'm happy with mine. 
[03:35:00]  I like this one, everybody's giving me shit about this one over here, I like this one.  Yeah, I don't know about that one.  No smoking?  I'm not a fan.  Why?  Just because I think it's sort of like, what it is, that tattoo, it's a black circle with an X across.  It's like the Ghostbusters logo without the ghost, and it's black.  But, I mean, I guess I get it, and I don't mind it on the level, like, that's not like a bad tattoo, whereas that one kind of is.  Right.  Like, that one's just kind of like, eh, whatever, to me.  What do I do?  I don't know what to do. 
[03:35:30]  I don't think the circle with the X is necessarily a problem.  I definitely wouldn't get it, but I understand, I guess, what you're doing.  Um, that, I think, and Troy, what you didn't see, I'm glad you're coming in here, because during the commercial, Joe showed me a picture of what his artist wanted to do with the initials.  And that's why I don't have a problem with the artist anymore.  Show Troy.  No, the artist is fine.  Show Troy what the guy wanted to do.  He's very good.  I just panicked at the thought of getting something so elaborate done. 
[03:36:00]  He wanted to add colorful, like, yellow and black accents behind the letters just to make it pop.  He wanted to do something like that.  How much better is that?  Yeah, that's a lot better.  A lot better.  I just thought it was too elaborate.  I was like, I don't know, man, it's going to be this huge thing on my arm.  Yeah, but now it's like, it looks like you got branded in a fraternity or something.  And it still looks like kitten, though.  Yeah, like, that tattoo looks like a mistake.  The problem?  And that's my problem, too.  The circle with the X on it, that also looks like I got this when I was fucking stupid. 
[03:36:30]  Not like, you know what I mean?  Yeah, it looks like a dare or something.  I like this one.  It looks poorly thought out, even though it's not.  I like this one.  I'm going to stand behind this one.  I mean, look, I got Rob Zombie's autograph on my arm.  Who am I to say?  Well, I mean, it's like you said.  To me, this is what it is.  So, that's cool.  You know, like, somebody can look at this and go, what are you against?  And I'd be like, well, what are you against?  It's up to you.  I don't care.  You go like this.  When somebody says, what are you against?  Look at him and say, what do you got?  And just be a tough guy like that. 
[03:37:00]  You know what I mean?  That's too...  You got tattoos now.  You can do it.  That's too coy.  And then I had the period at the end of your tattoo.  I swear to God, I almost had Keith Robinson tattooed inside of this thing.  And it would have been the funniest thing of all time.  That would have been fucking hilarious.  Yeah, for a week.  And then people would have been like...  I also was like...  You're right.  That was actually very giving of you, because now that's hilarious forever, because it's  always awful.  Yeah.  Well, I mean...  But it would have been the opening conversation in any meeting I ever had, ever.  Like, any time you go to pitch a TV show, anything. 
[03:37:30]  What's that?  Why do you...  Yeah, but...  Now it's like...  Yeah, that's true.  If they knew who Keith Robinson was.  Now you've got...  Now you've got Kitten in a box.  Look, I don't know what to do.  Troy, have you ever come back from, like, a week later and been like, oh,  fuck, this tattoo sucks?  Not really.  Not to that level?  No.  I mean, I've had tattoos where over time I'm like, ah, man, I shouldn't have...  Because you've had to cover stuff up before.  Yeah, absolutely.  But not until much later, you're saying.  Right.  This is what I wanted, and I thought it was fine until today. 
[03:38:00]  Today was the...  Really?  Yeah, I had no problem with it.  Well, then stand by it.  Just be like, ah, fuck all y'all.  Or do you think we're right?  Well, honestly, I can't tell, because, as you know, this is an environment that smells  blood in the water.  So, you know, I can't tell if everybody's hopping on me because, because, like, it's  the gang mentality of the room, or if it really is...  As I said earlier, I don't have a fucking problem with somebody looking at it and going, 
[03:38:30]  I don't get that.  Yeah.  I just don't want somebody to look at it and go, that is, that looks fucking terrible.  Like, that's what I don't want.  When Voss saw my Jack White tattoo, he trashed it, and that was because, okay, he's trashing  it because he's trashing it, and that's what Voss does.  But when I first got it, I came in here with it, and the guys were like, you know what,  that actually looks pretty cool.  So it's not like they just trash it because.  If it looked cool, they'd probably be like, oh, actually, you improved it.  Well, that's why I said I wasn't sure.  And now you are. 
[03:39:00]  It kind of looks like a homemade...  It looks like somebody did it in their home.  It looks like Joe did it himself.  Yeah.  Like, he had a tattoo done, and he's practicing on his own arm.  Here's what I think I could do, and I know you said you don't want to be one of those guys  with a mic tattoo, but whatever.  I think I could have the guy sort of brush up on this a little bit, make it look a little  more illustrated, turn this into a more significant microphone, and then even like, I don't know,  maybe I can even get fucking Carlin's face around it or next to it. 
[03:39:30]  But no microphones are sticks like that.  At least a microphone that way.  I'm saying if he came out and put it in, you know, whatever.  I told Joe, like, you don't want to be one of those comedians that has a microphone tattooed  on their arm.  It's not hacking.  That'd be like if I got like a radio mic, and it's like, come on, dude, what are you doing?  Well, I don't know what else to do.  I think you should...  Take my advice.  I'm not getting it lasered off.  No, I don't think you should get it.  It's not happening.  Get it covered up.  I think you should get some kind...  Find a good artist.  How do you get this covered, Troy?  I told you, you got to go bigger and darker.  I think you should find a good artist.  Do you think you're going to get a giant black spot on my arm? 
[03:40:00]  No, no, no.  You could do something that just kind of works in what's in the middle.  Do you not think he could add, like, accents to it, like that original thing?  Like, just add yellow and green shit to it?  It's hard, man, because it's just very, like, elementary looking.  Not saying that the tattoo artist was elementary, but it just doesn't look like...  It looks like somebody did it in, like, a trailer park or something.  It does.  And that's not his fault.  That's what he was working with.  No, that's what you wanted.  And the girl originally did a nice job with the lettering, but I would have appreciated 
[03:40:30]  if she did what she said she was going to do and supply me with different fonts and  be like, dude, let me just warn you now, you're going to have huge letters on your  fucking arm.  At the end of the day, though, they stencil it on first.  So you got to be like, this is going to be on my arm fucking forever.  I know.  And that font looks racist.  I know.  But you got to look at it and say, it looks like a racist font.  And I said to her, I'm worried that it looks racist because it's two big K's.  And she went, it doesn't say KKK.  And you were like, well, lady said it. 
[03:41:00]  Here's your money, lady.  She made me feel like, seriously, I'm not trying to pass the buck, but it's fucking bullshit.  It's like, you know what?  You're like a fucking doctor.  You know more about this than I do.  I'm trusting you right now.  You're very easily influenced, aren't you?  You're like a mechanic.  I'm trusting you.  You're telling me things I don't know about.  You're a sensitive guy.  You're easily influenced, aren't you?  I think so.  I would say, yeah, I'm kind of easily influenced, but I don't think that's an unfair point to  make about a tattoo artist.  It's like, you work in a field that I don't have a lot of understanding of, so you should 
[03:41:30]  go above and beyond your call of duty and say, look, dude, let me talk you through this  a little bit.  Also, at the end of the day, you need to have your radar on for either shitty artists or  people, or if you...  She was not a shitty artist.  She was a very good artist.  If you're rushing into something...  She just didn't fucking do what she was supposed to do.  I mean, at the end of the day, it's not her body that it's on.  So she might still stand by the fact that it doesn't say KKK, but you're the one who  has to deal with black guys looking at your arm like, what the fuck is your problem?  Right, well, she's rushing in 40 minutes late, which means all of her appointments are 
[03:42:00]  going to be later if she doesn't get to it.  That's not your problem.  You know what I mean?  That's not your problem.  I know it's not.  And my point is, is because it was a friend of mine and all this stuff, it's like, I gave her  more credit than I should have.  Yeah.  I was like, ah, we're friends, and I'll never fucking go to her again.  I'm not even friends with her anymore.  I think I should be your tattoo consultant, Joe.  I think you should run past all the tattoos that you're going to get, and I'll help you  out.  You've got to have a real clear design.  Next time, before you get another tattoo, you need to get the design approved by multiple 
[03:42:30]  people, because you are a poor decision maker in that chair.  Just with this one, I stand by the other two.  I like the other two.  They're very basic.  You could have done a lot more with them.  I think this, you know what I actually kind of want to do around this one, is get, when  this was healing, or it still is healing, but when I first got it, it was kind of bruised  up a bit, and there was like this weird, like red, like sort of bruising, like smudge  around it, and I thought like it actually would look cool if there was like this sort of like  red sort of like shading around it and stuff. 
[03:43:00]  You know what I mean?  I feel like that, I feel like that tattoo, the circle with the cross across it, but  something, but not that kind of thing, not like a starburst of red, but something that  would function like that.  Something that you have on a sleeve that was like your first tattoo when you were a kid,  and now you have a whole bunch of cool shit around it.  Yeah.  And then it's okay.  It's so dark, it's like, what do you do with it?  You just kind of sort of live with it.  Just sit it there, like, yeah, it's the first thing I got.  I was 18.  But I, I, I was drunk.  I know it's like, it was a dare, we were at, you know, Daytona Beach, spring break. 
[03:43:30]  There should be a really good story with that tattoo.  Yeah.  Well, what do you think needs to go around this one?  There's not much you can do, it's just black.  Like, you could have done, you could have done just an outline, and then done some gray  shading inside it to kind of just make it so bold.  You know what you do?  You add another line, X-Men, Wolverine movie is out this summer, now you're topical.  Oh, no.  What do you think?  I don't like that.  Yeah, yeah, make it an X-Men logo.  No, I don't think so.  Do you like the location of it? 
[03:44:00]  I mean, is that a good location?  Shouldn't it have been a little higher on the shoulder or something, maybe?  I mean, I probably wanted it so when he has a t-shirt on, it sticks out from the bottom  of the t-shirt.  Yeah, I wanted to be able to see it.  I don't kind of see the point of getting it where you can't see it.  Well, you can see it.  Because I don't take my shirt off, ever.  Ever.  Oh, I guess nobody, Mike in Indiana, what's up?  Oh, shit.  Hey, guys.  When can we see the tattoo online?  Because it's kind of silly you guys talking about something nobody can see.  All right, Troy, can you take a photo and text it to me? 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  Take a photo of the kitten tattoo.  All right, I'm going to put it up on Twitter, and Troy will put it up, too.  Also, Joe, do you also realize that there was only one Ultimate Warrior, you idiot?  He's right, Joe.  Do you realize I don't give a shit?  There was one Ultimate Warrior.  I want to say this before the tattoo goes online, the picture goes online.  The artist is tremendous.  I asked for this.  Yeah.  He was very accommodating.  On that one, I don't blame the artist.  I fully blame you.  He didn't have a lot to work with here.  Yeah. 
[03:45:00]  I don't want anybody to think we're trashing the artist.  Are you back with your girl?  Me?  No.  No, but you know what?  We do talk, and we have interaction now because of the show that day.  I actually went home and called her and apologized.  I was like, you know, of all the places that would make me feel like I was being a dick,  I was like, I was on O.P. and Anthony today, and I kind of feel like I was unfair to you  with certain things.  And we made up.  She didn't want to go back out, though? 
[03:45:30]  Well, I don't know.  No, I didn't try.  It was a really insensitive question.  I mean, that's a good question.  It wasn't like that kind of thing.  It was just kind of like, you know, let's talk and, you know, one of those.  Thank you for asking.  Jack in Colorado.  And this tattoo stands for my agnostic beliefs in the microcosm.  Oh, Joe, will you ever win?  You are.  You're the Charlie Brown of tattoos.  The tattoo artist just keeps moving that football, but you're going to keep swinging. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Eric in Florida.  Hey, Joe.  Is that a KKITN?  Is that a tattoo you don't like?  Oh, yeah, it is.  Yeah, it is.  He really fucked it up.  He's trying to fix it.  Is it just black text?  Yes, sir.  Yeah, but there's a rectangle around it, and then one side of the rectangle is way too  bold.  All right.  There's these two guys.  I was watching TV on this show.  These two guys made this invention, because normally, to get tattoo removed, you have to  laser it off or paint it off or something. 
[03:46:30]  But these guys made this invention.  You can find it on the internet.  It's got a 50-watt light bulb in it, and it absorbs.  It shoots down and breaks the pigmentation up, and in three minutes, it'll start breaking  that black in half and half until it's gone.  So you can try to look for that and remove it easily, or you can just keep getting shit  on it.  Are you being serious right now, or are you joking?  I'm being serious.  This show called Shark Tank, where these schmucks go on TV and try to get investment.  Yeah, they try to get investments from these billionaires, and they brought this tattoo 
[03:47:00]  invention they made.  It's like a 50-watt light bulb, and it breaks the light.  The light's all shot in this one little pin center, and you point that on the black spot  where you want to remove, and it breaks up the pigmentation in the skin and clears it  out.  Does it hurt?  No, it doesn't hurt at all.  I don't know anything about that.  Yeah, I don't know.  It doesn't hurt.  By the way, go to NotSam on Twitter.  Did you put it up?  No, no, no.  Okay, NotSam on Twitter to see a photo of Joe DeRosa's tattoo.  And I have a buddy who does tattoo removal, GoTattooRemoval, and if you go to their website, 
[03:47:30]  you can see he does amazing work.  Scott in Rochester.  Joe, you're overthinking it, dude.  Here's what you do.  You enlist in the Army.  You get deployed to Afghanistan.  There you go, Joe.  Jesus.  Ben in New Jersey.  I think Joe might want to get himself a handgun and try to tattoo his forehead.  That seems insensitive.  That's a very good call. 
[03:48:00]  Thanks, buddy.  Does anybody at all have anything, like, helpful?  You fucked up, Joe.  That's the helpful thing.  You fucked up.  I don't mean that in a shitty way.  I've been trying to help you out the whole time.  I know.  I know.  But you're not...  Troy, relax today.  He's not listening to you, Troy.  No, he's not.  He's like, does anybody have anything helpful to say?  What do you think I've been trying to do?  I want to hear some suggestions.  I'm really asking.  Here's what you do, Joe.  Here's what you can do.  Here's your suggestions.  Either you get a skin graft, okay, where you have the piece of skin removed, you have 
[03:48:30]  the tattoo removed by a laser, or you cover it up, or you just own it and you just deal  with it.  Those are your options.  Joe is like a girl because he doesn't actually want the solutions to the problems.  He just wants to be able to talk about it forever.  He wants to finish out the after show talking about his tattoo.  He wants somebody to tell him somehow that it's okay in a convincing way.  Right.  But it's not okay.  No.  It's a big mistake.  Oh, stop it.  It's fine.  And what you got to do is either cover it up with some design.  I get that. 
[03:49:00]  Add some accents to it.  I keep asking, what design could you cover this with?  Go to an artist.  Anything.  Well, you know.  Literally anything.  There's a reason we put the picture online is because I thought people would be like,  oh, here's what you could do with it.  Well, I just put it online.  I told you.  I'll introduce you to my tattoo artist.  He's amazing.  He'll figure out something great to do with it.  I am looking at this.  But, you know.  And if you're on Instagram, check out.  His name is Justin Weatherholtz.  He's at Kings Avenue Tattoos.  There was another option that you didn't mention.  It's this light bulb tattoo removal thing that apparently works, according to the reviews, 
[03:49:30]  at least.  Find the new tattoo removal device.  I don't know.  Jim in Syracuse.  I wanted to congratulate Dangerous Joe on his first funny line ever on the O&A show.  He said, if there's two things I know, it's tattoos and wrestling.  There it is.  There it is.  And that wasn't even that funny.  You didn't think so?  No.  He's joking with you, Joe.  What am I still here for right now?  Just for suggestions. 
[03:50:00]  We were all wondering the same thing.  Is it to the point where now the callers are going to trash me, too?  Hopefully.  I was here for that.  Is that it?  Is that all I'm here for?  Joe, look at the phones.  They're lightened up.  They're lightened up.  If we could clear all the phone banks just to make sure every caller is just insulting  Joe in some way.  Well, we only got a couple minutes left.  I mean, I don't know.  I could mention that the reason we were talking about Ultimate Warrior earlier is because Roland  and me went down, and I interviewed him yesterday because he's in this new DWE video game. 
[03:50:30]  It's up on YouTube if you search Sam Roberts, Ultimate Warrior.  WWE2K14.  Yeah, that's what it's called.  WWE2K14.  Well, this is going to talk to her 29th.  It comes out October.  I have the other one, though.  From before.  Right, so you buy the new one when it comes out.  Right, right, right.  There you go.  See, I got the one last year.  You got the one before?  From 2K13.  Oh, no.  I believe it was called WWE13.  Right.  This one we're talking about.  Is the next one.  2K14.  14. 
[03:51:00]  Yes, yes, yes.  And if you pre-order, it's got the Ultimate Warrior.  But the problem was, this is what a Dick Roland was, that we go down there.  We didn't know the Warrior was going to be there, but I invited Eric to go with me to  this press conference.  Right.  And he was like, oh, I can't go.  I got stuff going on.  Right.  So we get down there, and the Warrior's there, and I do this interview with him, and then  Roland says, oh, would you take a picture with Sam, too?  I go, oh, that'd be great.  So he takes a photo, and then Roland, without any provocation, says, oh, and can I please jump  in for one, too?  I'm a huge fan. 
[03:51:30]  And he couldn't be less of an Ultimate Warrior fan.  Are you a huge fan?  I didn't know who the fuck that guy was.  The first thing he does, sends old E-Rocket texts, hey, look what you missed.  It's a picture of Roland and the Warrior.  You didn't care if you met him?  No, I set it up for Sam, because he wanted to interview him, but I was excited for the  sandwiches that were there, provided for me.  Did that hurt you, Eric?  No, because that's not how he phrased it at all.  How did he phrase it?  He phrased it along the lines.  He's like, yeah, the interview went good.  I said, was he crazy?  I heard he's difficult.  No, it went good.  Yeah, but that was the whole conversation. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, and then he goes, look, we got photos, and sent me the photo, so there was nothing malicious  about it.  Yes, it was malicious.  The whole fact that the photo exists is malicious.  All right, if you say so.  You know, Eric is a glutton for punishment.  Don't act like you got a heart, Sam.  Don't act like you're somehow calling out this terrible thing Roland did, and you see the  harm in it, and you're on Eric's side.  Don't get butthurt, because you got a bad tattoo, Joe.  I am not butthurt.  I'm just saying, don't try to act like a nice guy right now. 
[03:52:30]  You're a little butthurt that you came on the show, and you're coming to the realization  that you fucked up your arm forever.  And Sam and I made a big celebrity, too.  And then, what's it?  Who?  The guy who played the Hulk.  Mark Ruffalo.  Mark Ruffalo was on the subway with us.  You met Mark Ruffalo on the subway?  We didn't meet him, but he was on the train with us.  I love Mark Ruffalo.  Well, as he's getting off, he's still in the car, and Roland goes, Dr. Banner!  What'd he do?  He just cringed. 
[03:53:00]  He just cringed.  It was the worst.  Shout out a person could make.  Mark Ruffalo's like some guy that looks like the out-of-shape Hulk just yelled Dr. Banner at  E-Rock, you weren't mad that Roland...  Well, at least I could lose away.  You can never get rid of your tattoo.  What?  You're nasty.  Oh, god damn.  Cover your arms.  E-Rock, you weren't mad that Roland decided to take a picture?  No.  Not really.  I don't take a picture of a retard.  Did you offer me the chance to take a picture?  Why didn't you?  Oh, shit. 
[03:53:30]  Taking shots at DeRosa again.  Oh, Roland's got some venom.  We gotta go.  Because we were behind on breaks today, unfortunately.  But, Joe DeRosa, where are you gonna be?  Gotham Comedy Club this Friday and Saturday night.  And make sure to go to NotSam on Twitter.  You can see the Joe DeRosa tattoo and send some suggestions to Joe DeRosa Comedy on Twitter.  Actually, please don't.  Serious suggestions only.  Please don't.  Watch suits.  I'm not gonna read my mentions.  I'm DJing at 675 Bar in New York City tomorrow, and then Friday I'm at Los Feliz DJing. 
[03:54:00]  And fuck it, Norton's gonna be at The Gathering.  Yeah, and we're doing Montreal next week.  I'm looking forward to that.  Montreal next week.  Tonight, suits.  USA.
