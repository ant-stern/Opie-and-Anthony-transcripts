<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie describing receiving a copy of his book, *Happy Endings*, completely destroyed by someone using Jets stationery.  The hosts jokingly speculated about the sender's motives, calling him a "retard" and "idiot," and making crude assumptions about his personal life.  The conversation then shifted to a caller, Greg from Nebraska, who discussed the Dixie Chicks' anti-Bush stance and its impact on their album sales.  This led to a discussion about the political climate surrounding George W. Bush and Barack Obama, with the hosts using Obama's middle name derisively and making crude jokes about fetuses and sushi.

The show then focused on "super fans," with numerous examples cited, including Captain Jet, the drum guy, Freddy Says, and Dancing Larry.  The hosts expressed extreme contempt for these individuals, using offensive terms like "douche" and "retard," and suggesting violence against them.  A caller informed the hosts of their impending removal from DirecTV due to a merger. More super fan stories followed, including descriptions of a hot dog-throwing fan, a Red Sox-bashing fan, and a barrel-wearing fan.  The hosts also discussed a documentary about suicide attempts at the Golden Gate Bridge.  Opie then shared a high school love letter he wrote, which was read on air, containing both romantic expressions and harsh insults.

The next segment heavily featured Jim Norton’s embarrassing high school love letters, rediscovered by the recipient, which were discussed in detail, along with his past awkward romantic encounters. This transitioned into anecdotes about Steve, a studio employee who brought cookies, leading to jokes about possible poisoning.  Norton recounted stories about past relationships, including leasing a car to an ex-girlfriend instead of giving an engagement ring, and a conflict arising from his ex-girlfriend driving Anthony's ex-wife to a lawyer. Audio from Kevin Hines, a Golden Gate Bridge suicide survivor, was played.  The hosts discussed their past reckless behavior.  A call from Mark followed, featuring a short bit about his movie preferences, and a discussion about a *Godfather* scene and a failed Comedy Central pilot.

The following segment began with further discussion of Kevin Hines’ survival.  The hosts then transitioned to a discussion about auditory hallucinations, specifically a recurring "hey" sound, leading to a call with Dr. Steve who identified it as a hypnagogic episode.  Dr. Steve explained hypnagogic and hypnopompic episodes, and other sleep phenomena.  The conversation turned to Obama apologizing for a comment about Nancy Reagan, and the election of Stu Rasmussen, the first openly transgender mayor. The hosts expressed varying levels of comfort with Rasmussen.  Criticism of Mayor Bloomberg's policies, particularly his proposed plastic bag tax, followed, with the hosts comparing the gradual increase in taxes to slowly boiling a lobster.  Listener calls about auditory hallucinations, parking tickets, and New York City parking challenges ensued, including a discussion of Toronto's parking meter policies.  The segment concluded with more listener calls and the hosts' upcoming appearances.

The show continued with a segment heavily focusing on listener calls detailing frustrations with New York City parking enforcement, high ticket costs, and difficulties faced by delivery drivers.  A caller recounted a meter maid being dragged by a car, and another described a physical altercation.  Listeners shared anecdotes about exorbitant parking fees at hospitals and sporting events. The hosts and callers used frequent profanity.  A listener mentioned a "view tax" in Utah, and the hosts discussed their experiences with “Parking Wars” and a previous bit about the Elephant Man.  Reality TV shows, particularly "Celebrity Rehab," and Jim Norton’s book were discussed.  Dr. Michio Kaku and Paul McCartney were mentioned. The potential removal from DirecTV was briefly touched upon.

The final segment centered around “Jimmy Justice,” a YouTube personality who films and confronts NYC traffic enforcement agents.  Opie, Anthony, and Patrice (a studio guest) played audio clips from Jimmy Justice's videos, highlighting confrontations with agents, often described with derogatory terms, specifically targeting overweight African-American women with a particular hairstyle.  The conversation focused on the agents' perceived incompetence and abuse of power. Jimmy Justice himself called in, detailing his motivations and methods.  He confirmed his videos had led to some positive changes and mentioned specific instances of agents facing consequences.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  It's amazing to me what happened.  What a bunch of babies people are.  I got a little note. Somebody actually sent me a copy of Happy Endings, which I wrote.  Yeah.  With all the pages torn out of it.  Oh.  Somebody who's obviously a classic individual because they have Jets writing paper. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, that's Jets, um, a stationery they wrote.  Hey, don't make fun of my Jets, because this guy's a psychopath.  I love my Jets.  I don't like, uh...  What was his name?  Did you write the, uh, note?  I don't like Jetman, but I like the Jets.  Jim, I am spreading the wealth with this book.  With the four tickets we're going to buy for the Stress Factory.  I guess my, my, because I liked Obama and I didn't, I didn't like McCain.  Yeah.  That, uh, that the Spread the Wealth tie-in.  Yeah.  And you probably wouldn't have gotten four tickets anyway, retard, because all five shows 
[00:01:00]  are sold out.  Oh!  Ah!  As far as the new book, you have to be crapping me.  Try keeping your liberal mouth shut.  Voting based on Bush and based on race is just ignorance.  What?  Is it?  Here's the point.  Stupid, you bought the book first.  Once you purchased the book, you probably didn't know what it was when you bought it.  I thought it was a hat.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Um, the whole, the book trashes liberals.  The new book, you dummy. 
[00:01:30]  It almost trashes no conservative.  It's 95% liberal professional.  Yeah.  You idiot.  Wait, so he bought a book, mailed it to you.  That was old happy endings.  He was basically letting me know, and I was getting my comeuppance.  Ah.  I don't care, dude.  Don't buy the new book.  Jimmy, he showed you.  He sure did.  He spent money and then ripped it up and mailed it to me.  So not only did you read the book first, and I know you enjoyed it,  you had to take the time to rip it up.  You now don't own the book anymore, and you paid post it.  To mail it to you.  Very smart. 
[00:02:00]  And you did a good show at the Stress Factory.  Where did you lose in this?  I didn't.  The shows were sold out, so there wasn't the glaring empty seat  that this idiot would have been sitting in.  Four empty tickets right up front.  Where's that guy?  What happened to them?  A nice spotlight on the one empty table.  All shiny.  So you didn't lose out there.  You got the money for the book.  You didn't lose out there.  It wasn't any COD delivery on the package that got to you,  so he paid for that. 
[00:02:30]  Where do you lose?  Probably in the fact that I had to hold that awful writing paper.  I don't mind this little Jets writing paper.  If you're an 11-year-old boy who wrote this, I accept it.  You're writing to Brett Favre.  Exactly.  Because I know if the FBI was to do a print thing on it,  they would see Dear Santa probably on the page right above this.  I'm actually going to save this.  Hope your next book is better than this one.  Love your grandson, Frank.  It really is like that childlike writing,  but I love the fact that he's just trying to show me who his boss is. 
[00:03:00]  You've got a few pages for your paperback now, Jimmy.  He showed you.  You should put this in your paperback.  Yeah, maybe I will.  Not a bad idea.  Jim, I'm spreading the wealth with this book  and with the four tickets we were going to buy for the Stress Factory.  As far as the new book, you have to be S-ing me.  Try keeping your liberal mouth shut.  I just had to read it for myself.  It doesn't make sense.  It's based on Bush and based on race is just ignorant.  I'm spreading the wealth by not going to the Stress Factory.  It doesn't make sense, sir.  No, it doesn't.  But I'm glad you didn't go because you're obviously a dumbbell 
[00:03:30]  who wants to hear a prime material that I'm not doing.  Jimmy's spreading the chuckles.  He was spreading the humor there, and you missed it.  Absolutely.  Boy, did you miss out.  Yeah.  Every page he had to tear out one by one,  or did he just tear the binding out?  I don't know.  Keep doing that.  Keep buying products.  Ruining them.  Yeah.  Sending them to the people who created them,  and then complaining how you don't have money.  I bet after he was done with that, he smashed his wife in the face.  Let's hope so. 
[00:04:00]  Did he go out and puncture his own tires?  I'll show Jim I am not going to work.  You, sir, are a dope.  Wow.  Dope.  Let's go to Greg in Nebraska.  He's not a baby boy he didn't like losing.  Is that it, baby boy?  Yeah.  He didn't like losing, baby boy?  Hey, Greg, how are you, buddy?  Greg?  Greg?  Greg?  Greg?  Greg?  Oh, Greg!  I mean, it's Greg.  What's up, Greg?  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  You're the first call of the week.  How does that feel, my friend? 
[00:04:30]  First call of the week.  We're not even awake yet.  Wow.  So what do you got?  Well, I was just thinking, the Dixie Chicks, they came down hard on Bush, you know, and everybody  went out and bought their CDs to burn them in the streets.  Yep.  And I think that CD right there was their best-selling CD.  Oh, that's how it always works, sure.  Problem with the Dixie Chicks was that they trashed Bush in England.  I think that's why they annoyed people.  There was something irritating about that because it was like most, you know, can we all know 
[00:05:00]  how Britain, the British have these weird view of Americans?  And it's almost like such a whore move for any performer, male or female, to go there  and just to get the audience to clap.  I go, he ain't my president.  Yeah.  Just like that cheap slut applause.  Wait, I didn't know he did that in Europe.  The Dixie Chicks did that in Europe?  Yeah.  Well, they did.  Yeah, that was in...  No, I thought they did it in America somewhere.  I mean, if you're going to have, you know, balls, do it in Texas.  It was also the fact that...  That's what they said.  Not everybody in Texas. 
[00:05:30]  No, go ahead.  Well, Greg, I think we're done with you.  It's your show now.  All right.  It's the Greg from Nebraska show.  Yeah.  I think it's also the fact that it was early on and, you know, you couldn't, you couldn't  criticize Bush without really being hung out to dry at that point and not being supportive.  Bush was tied in with, if you didn't support Bush, you didn't support the troops, the war,  9-11, America, 9-11, you were on the side of the terrorists.  Hated children.  Yeah, everything.  It was just everything.  You loved Osama bin Laden.  Right.  Wanted to have tea with him somewhere. 
[00:06:00]  Helping the insurgents.  Yeah.  Like everything.  And then it just became like all the rage to bash Bush.  Well, now it's easy.  Yeah.  Although there's a few still defending him out there.  I understand.  He's, you know...  Who?  There's a few.  Oh, yeah.  Well, his approval rating is like 20 or something.  So 20% of the people are still approving of him.  Sure.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's 20.  It's probably a little higher than that.  Well, just wait.  Just wait till Barry gets in there and takes over, my friends.  Barack Hussein. 
[00:06:30]  Barry.  Obama.  Hussein.  How did we do that in a few short years?  Barack Hussein Obama.  Anyone with the Hussein in the name.  How in a few short years did we do that?  Remember Saddam Hussein?  You wouldn't hire anyone with the name Hussein for your tiny little business.  No.  Somewhere in the middle of Jersey.  In a few short years, everyone in the country just went, ah, screw it.  Yeah.  Hussein, whatever.  Barack Hussein Obama.  So he's going to, apparently, they're talking about him using this executive order that he 
[00:07:00]  can do.  He can pull these shenanigans that George Bush used and was crucified for using by Congress  and Democrats and liberals and everything.  But he's going to use them, like, the second he gets in there, to get things done immediately.  One of which is stem cell research.  Which, we have stem cell research.  It's just not federally funded in certain...  Well, Bush made it pretty tough. 
[00:07:30]  You can't use embryonic stem cells.  Yeah.  Right.  It was very tough because Bush in his pro-life stance and his religion and everything decided,  you know, he was going to play God and not let doctors come up with cures to horrible  diseases using stem cells.  So Barack is going to try to turn that around.  Well, I heard he's going to and he's hiring some sushi chefs as we speak.  Really?  To take care of the stem cells.  To fillet the little fetuses and embryos.  They're ready to rock.  That's wonderful.  They're ready to rock with the fetuses. 
[00:08:00]  A little fetus roll.  Sure.  Spicy.  Spicy, crunchy fetus roll.  Nice.  Tender, delicious.  But here's something else that a dummy is doing.  Here's something that idiot is doing.  He's our president.  President-elect.  In a month or two.  He's the president-elect dummy.  Two months.  And here's another thing he's doing.  If you haven't noticed, driving around, gas prices, especially in some parts of Jersey,  gas prices are down everywhere.  But in some parts of Jersey, $1.99 a gallon, symbolically below $2 a gallon. 
[00:08:30]  It is $2 a gallon.  But symbolically, you see that $1 thing up there.  It makes you feel good.  And that's because I think the economy has driven down gas prices because there isn't  as much demand.  People aren't spending money going out, driving, traveling, whatever.  And it's brought oil prices way down.  This dummy, the second he gets in, is going to sign this executive order to stop any drilling  that George Bush wanted to do in Utah because it might hurt the delicate ecosystem there. 
[00:09:00]  You know what that's going to do?  You know what your buddy Barack is going to do now?  Drive the goddamn oil prices right back up again.  Here's the idiot that sat there talking about how it's the economy, the economy, and how  no one can afford anything, and the poor middle class, and everything else, and tax the rich,  and all that bullcrap.  And the first thing he's going to do, the second he gets a pen in his hand, is sign something 
[00:09:30]  that is going to drive the price of gas right to F back up where it was at $4 a gallon,  if you remember that.  $4 a gallon.  But, Anthony, he can't be that stupid.  He's that stupid.  He's got to know that's what would happen.  Because he's a liberal dummy who's going to sit there and make sure a hoot owl is saved,  make sure some lizard can walk around on the desert floor in Utah because he doesn't want 
[00:10:00]  to hear ka-chunk, ka-chunk of an oil rig.  Say praying mantis.  What?  Oh, the praying mantis.  Who cares about the praying mantis?  You know it's illegal to kill one?  Oh, I know.  As a kid, I was very scared.  I thought the feds would get me.  I thought they were watching me.  How did that rumor get started, by the way?  I don't know, but boy, did that thing stick.  Oh, yeah, it did.  You kill a praying mantis, you get arrested.  One praying mantis started that whole rumor.  Yeah, hey, don't kill me.  It's illegal.  It's an alien-looking thing.  That one and the one where the curb was government's property. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  You could stand on the curb and taunt your enemies right in front of their house, and they  tell you to leave, and you go, I'm on government's property.  Government's property.  That was like your kid's way of just saying, leave me.  I can stand here and taunt you and your siblings.  I remember that one.  Government's property.  You're on the grass.  I am not.  I'm on the curb.  That's government's property.  Let's say hi to Brian in Detroit. 
[00:11:00]  Brian.  What's going on, guys?  Is it cold in the D?  That's all we need to know.  It's cold in the D.  It's cold in the D.  Most ma-mah-mah-mah-mah-mah-mah-mah-mah-mah.  Where's my clip for it's cold in the D?  It's cold in the D.  I can't find it every time someone from Detroit calls.  Oh, Western Echo's checking in saying praying mantises are queers.  They look like snakes.  They're not queers.  They have little teeny heads.  How do they think of anything?  And giant eyeballs.  But they're always praying.  They really are.  Very religious little things.  Look, hey, it worked. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  Go ahead, Brian.  I got something that's going to really make Anthony happy.  Yes, sir.  I went to Chicago over the weekend downtown.  The majority of the blacks had hats on that said the United States of Obama.  Not America.  Yeah.  Obama.  Yeah.  I saw a few of those on the news.  It was the United States of Obama hats.  That's wonderful.  Can I say my favorite part of your call, sir?  Was that after you said the United States of Obama, you went, not America.  Like, we weren't exactly sure what that should have been. 
[00:12:00]  United States of Emirates.  You know, this is just going to be fantastic because all these guys with the United States of Obama hats and the shirts that say Obama and the shirts that say my president is black.  There's a bunch of these things going around.  Read into what this guy is going to do, because not only is he doing stupid stuff like that, he's doing business as usual things, too, which cracked me up.  He's talking. 
[00:12:30]  All of a sudden, he started talking tough to Iran about their nuclear program.  I like that.  Saying, hey, you know, you can't just have some nuclear program.  Hey, what happened?  Yeah.  You can't just say that.  You got to sit and chat with the guy.  You got to sit and have a little chat.  Yeah, but he was saying that before he read the secret documents.  Now that he's read the secret documents.  Oh, maybe now he's like, hey, these guys don't have this.  I know how I'm supposed to act now.  Okay, I get it.  I get it.  And the people got to understand, the ones that are wearing all that Obama stuff, like your team just won the Super Bowl. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to go out on a limb, but most of those people don't read a lot of books, and those are the people that are going to be very disappointed.  I'm telling you, if you're wearing one of those crazy spray-painted Obama shirts or one of those Obama hats, those are the ones that are going to be very disappointed.  They don't know how this whole game works.  Nope.  I'm telling you.  It's business as usual, only, you know, it's a liberal Democrat.  Yeah, I understand. 
[00:13:30]  But it's still business as usual.  But those people think that the entire world's going to change, and their lives are going to get incredibly better, and it's just not going to happen that way.  It's just not.  You know, the crappy economy brought down the fuel prices.  Right.  Really did.  The worst thing you could do is something that's now going to boost fuel prices in a crappy economy.  The only thing we have to cling to is the fact that fuel prices went down, and things like shipping of goods and stuff, the prices of that, it's a little more manageable for these companies that are trying to conduct business. 
[00:14:00]  But you sign an executive order that's going to raise the price of gas again.  And, wow, are you screwing up the economy even more.  Let's say hi to Greg in New Hampshire.  Greg.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Greg.  I threw her last week.  You guys promised that there wasn't going to be any more political talk.  Well, we're saying, it's just the weekend.  Ant, Ant, Ant, you're calling him a dummy.  He's the president-elect.  He won by a majority overwhelming. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, because he's a dummy.  Please, Ant, Ant.  I have a choice now, sir.  I bought the serious package.  I can switch it to Howard, and I will.  You said no more political bullshit.  Here we go.  Go to Howard.  Go switch.  Don't even say it.  Just do it, Dave.  Hey, Greg.  Okay, it's over.  Take care.  All right, goodbye.  Bye, Greg.  Bye.  It's over.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, we won't talk about anything.  Take care.  Goodbye.  You didn't get your way, little baby.  Bye-bye.  Sorry, kid.  It's wrong with you.  Obviously, this guy hasn't listened to us long, because we would never go for that dumb game.  If you don't stop doing this, I'm going to listen to Howard. 
[00:15:00]  Well, then go listen to Howard.  Skin off my ass.  Right.  I still get paid jackass.  I bet he yells.  I bet what the problem is.  That's just somebody who's used to yelling.  Like, when Mommy doesn't do what they want, they probably, like, yell, I'll do this.  And Mommy goes, all right, all right.  Go ahead.  Bye.  Hey, you know what it is?  It's not the politics.  Listen to the way he said that.  It's that I don't agree with his politics.  Hey, he won by a majority.  That guy, he's the president-elect.  All right.  If I was pro-Obama and really just sitting here stating that, he wouldn't even have called. 
[00:15:30]  You're raining on his parade there, Anthony.  Let me rain on it.  Good.  You know what?  We are going to move on, because the Jets had an amazing victory, even though they're winning without Brett Favre, basically.  How was that?  87 to 1?  I don't know.  I think it was 40 to zip at halftime, and I was done.  And then, of course, it plays out like every blowout plays out.  The second half is a complete bore fest.  Yeah.  The Jets score another touchdown, and the Rams scored, what, a field goal?  47 to 3?  Something like that?  Yep.  Pats beating the Bills, though. 
[00:16:00]  I'm paying attention.  Thursday night, I believe, right?  It's the Pats and the Jets fighting for first place.  But we've got to talk about this douche after the break.  We've got one of these in your town, supporting your favorite team.  What is wrong with that?  This guy, his name is Captain Jet, and he's wearing a huge jet plane football helmet thing on his head.  Can we get the picture up on onaradio.com?  Yep.  And I want to talk about this, because I'm a season ticket holder for the Islanders. 
[00:16:30]  And every team has to have that one douche that's looking for attention.  That has nothing to do with the team.  He's not a mascot.  He's just a super fan that wants to be known as the super fan for that particular team.  Yep.  I know we've got the Jet guy that gets the crowd going, and he's pretty impressive, the fire dude.  Fireman Ed.  Fireman Ed is pretty impressive.  The guy that gets the J-E-T-S-Jets a chant going.  He's an exception to the rule, because most of these guys are losers like this guy, Captain Jet. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, what about that?  Yeah, Cowbell guy, Cowbell man at the Mets game.  This is what we're going to get into after the break for a few minutes.  Yes.  Annoying ass.  Danny will explain Cowbell man for everybody that's out of town.  You know who was the most annoying person ever?  Huh?  Bernie Williams' effing wife.  What?  She would sit there at one World Series.  She sat right behind home plate and just banged these sticks together and made this bang, bang, bang. 
[00:17:30]  And it was right near an ambient sound microphone for the game.  So the entire time you're just hearing this bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  The whole time I wanted to punch her in her face.  All right.  We'll talk about a few of these zeros after the break.  877-212-ON-A.  Opie and Anthony.  It's a Monday.  We all know that.  Hence the wake up music.  Jesus.  What are you going to do?  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:18:00]  I don't know.  Something's going on.  Let's say hi to Blitz.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Blitz.  How are you today?  Hi, guys.  Hi, hi.  I'm fine.  What's this bull crap about Sirius XM removing the virus from DirecTV's listings?  We're not going to be on DirecTV now?  Yeah.  What?  It's going to be removed, like, tomorrow or something.  What's the reason?  I'm sure it has something to do with the merger.  I don't know.  No, I just scrolled up on the guide. 
[00:18:30]  I didn't know it would no longer be offered on DirecTV.  We have a nice audience that listens to this show through DirecTV.  That's good.  What's the reason given?  I don't know.  We haven't confirmed it yet, but we've been hearing that it's Wednesday, that they remove it.  Oh, yeah.  That's another thing probably from, you know, corporate.  You guys are going to fight this, right? 
[00:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  We fight everything.  We're beating men.  We fight by sitting here on a daily basis and keeping our jobs.  Yeah.  Just wonderful.  That's our fight.  You can't fight City Hall.  That's what I say.  You can't fight...  Never mind.  I'm not going to say...  I'm showing today that I'm a good boy.  Oh, boy.  Was I going to say something?  Thank you, Blitz.  All right.  Bye, guys.  By the way, it's my birthday tomorrow. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  I mean, no, wait.  Well, next month, really, but never mind.  What's wrong with you?  I love this guy.  There's something wrong with you, but that's okay.  Sounds like he just blows his nose all day long.  Almost a big A thing going on.  Yeah, well, you know.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dave in Cleveland.  What's up, Dave?  Now that you guys are talking about it before the break, super fans.  Yes.  Cleveland Indians have a guy that actually buys an extra ticket to bring a drum to the game 
[00:20:00]  and bang it out in the bleachers.  So he has to buy two seats, one for him and one for his drum?  Yes.  And he wants to be known as the drum guy?  He's got some silly name, but I'm not sure what it is.  I'm the drum.  We also have the big dog, a big fat-ass guy that sits in the dog pound for the Browns  game.  Yeah, we've seen him.  He's thinned down a little bit, but the drum guy is annoying. 
[00:20:30]  Just attention whores.  It's like, look at me.  Yeah.  Look, I'm part of the game.  Yeah, exactly.  I come down here and people come to see me.  Yeah.  He walks around the stadium with his drum, like, oh, wow, look, drum guy.  Oh, my God.  It's a drum guy.  You know, he just sits in one seat.  He won't move.  He can't move.  He's just because it's too big.  It's a big bass drum.  You know what?  If I was a guy who sat next to drum guy, oh, boy, would that drum not be playable. 
[00:21:00]  I'd be knife guy that stabs the drum guy.  Yeah.  Well, not even stab the drum guy.  Just stab the drum.  Stab his drum?  Just over and over again.  I mean, he's got to run out of money eventually where he can't buy another replacement drum.  Drum heads.  Yeah, I would assume the first three or four times he would come to the stadium with a  new drum.  Yeah.  But you continue stabbing that drum, you know, what's he going to do?  He's going to run out of money fast.  Yes, Travis?  I was going to bring up another super fan.  Okay.  Sweet old Freddy Says over at Yankee Stadium. 
[00:21:30]  Freddy Says.  He's the guy that bangs with the spoon in the pan.  Right.  Walks around.  His name is Freddy Says?  Yeah, because he's got the sign.  It says Freddy Says and then a witty little thing about the Yankees.  Yeah.  And the pan is all banged up.  Oh, yeah.  And the spoon.  And you look at it and go, that's the pan.  It's right there.  And the spoon.  If your whole thing is that everyone knows you because you go to a game to watch a team  so often, the government should shoot you in the back of the head. 
[00:22:00]  You have nothing to contribute.  He's beloved by every time.  He's not beloved.  He's a zilch.  Of course.  You saw him.  He loves him.  He's beloved by who?  Yeah, I saw that guy.  We saw him in Michael's.  Did you get a picture of him?  I'm like, who, him?  And he goes, that's Freddy Says.  How about this?  No.  Freddy Says, scream, whistle, keep up noise.  It helps Yanks.  Exactly.  That's what his sign says.  Let's take a picture with an old man who actually carries that out of the house and spells says  wrong. 
[00:22:30]  He looks like he's tired before he gets to his seat.  It's like just too much going on.  The only thing I like that Freddy Says was, I have AIDS.  I have to leave the band, boys.  Sorry.  Freddy Says.  His crazy teeth of mine got me in trouble.  Well, can we get some of the pictures of these super fans up on onaradio.com?  The Cleveland guy, apparently, is named John Adams, and he's been at every game since 1973. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, that's wonderful for him.  Guess what?  You know.  Every game.  The rest of us had family obligations.  We couldn't go to every effing game.  You loser.  You knew there were certain moments where it was like he had to make a choice between  something very important and the game, and he had to tell his family or people like  No, I have to.  You don't understand how important this is.  I haven't missed a game.  I know it's Dad's funeral, but the Indians.  He'd understand because he knows how much this means to me and the fans. 
[00:23:30]  I'll draw him extra hard for Dad.  I have a job to make these people happy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to John on Long Island.  John.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, bro?  Nothing, man.  And I sit behind that fat idiot, Captain Jet.  Elegant.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  This all started because there's a picture of Captain Jet in one of the rags here in New  York, and he just looks like a big fat douche. 
[00:24:00]  His hat is a jet plane.  With wheels.  It's got landing gear, engines, wings, a tail, the whole thing.  It's a jet plane hat.  Yeah.  And he's got a big thing on his chest that says Captain Cape.  He's got a Captain Jet logo, like the Superman logo.  Yeah, like the Superman logo, but it's ten times bigger.  Yeah.  With this big fat body.  Yeah.  And a green cape.  Yeah.  Well, he's getting a lot of attention today, but what do you got on him?  He wears a cape you're saying, John?  Yeah, and he goes up and down the aisles, and I just want to fire his fat ass right down 
[00:24:30]  the stairs, man.  And you have to sit behind him, right?  Yeah, I sit like three rows back, and he's just retarded.  It doesn't matter.  He's always drunk.  He's like a retard.  Oh, boy.  He looks like John Goodman.  TB 1, 2, 3, 4, and I hope Corey Lytle is in his hat.  That's great with Clem Munson.  Thurman.  Good old Thurman.  All right.  Well, there you go.  You guys got Captain Jet at the home games there. 
[00:25:00]  Yep.  All right, guys.  Good luck to you.  Yeah, right on.  Let's say hi to Chris in Alabama.  Alabama, man!  Hey, roll tide.  Bama!  Bama!  Bama!  We have the University of Alabama football game.  Sweet home!  Sweet home Alabama.  Alabama, man!  I'm out!  At University of Alabama football games, we've got these two guys.  Alabama, man!  Poor guy.  And isn't that Kid Rock song just terrific? 
[00:25:30]  Making money off Leonard Skinner?  That's wonderful.  How about all musicians just start writing songs where they don't sample anybody else?  How about we try that again?  It's catchy, but come on.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Chris.  Anyway, at Alabama football games, they've got these two guys that have been showing up  since the Bear Bryant era, and they're two real tall guys with red pants and these big  Alabama ties, and they are both carrying plungers with a roll of toilet tissue, a tied detergent 
[00:26:00]  box, and then another roll of toilet tissue, you know, a roll-tied roll.  And they have actually people line up before the games to get their pictures taken with  these two guys, and they're just two fans.  They just show up at every game.  I don't get the toilet paper.  We don't get it, though.  Roll, tied, roll.  Oh.  That's the University of Alabama show.  Roll, tied, roll.  Oh, right.  And, I mean, they're literally, you can see, you can find them because there are lines  of hundreds of people before Alabama football games lined up to get a picture with these 
[00:26:30]  two guys, and they're from Scottsboro, Alabama.  They're called the Scottsboro Boys.  Right.  So there you go.  Anyway, roll, tied.  You know what I noticed yesterday?  Huh.  I noticed with digital cameras, people take probably hundreds more pictures than they  used to take.  Of course.  Hundreds.  Yet, no one sees them because they're worthless pictures most of the time.  You used to, if you had a camera, you used to wait because you had to develop it, get 
[00:27:00]  hard prints back.  It meant something.  The drugstore.  Yeah.  It meant something.  Now, your pictures reside on your cameras, on your computers.  You never look at them, really.  How many of them do you actually print out on photographic paper and frame?  You know, people do.  I understand.  None.  People do.  Very rare.  Me?  None.  Right.  My sister, my family, occasionally, like Patrick will take that, print it out, put it in 
[00:27:30]  a frame, but I think people are taking so many pictures that will just never, ever be seen  by anybody.  That's a very good point.  One of those, what are you going to do with a picture of the guy with the roll-tied roll  thing?  Are you hanging that up somewhere?  Are you going to blow it up to poster size?  You got to get one of those digital picture frames where the pictures rotate.  That's great, dude.  One of those.  I have one of those.  A few of those.  Sure.  You got to get those, but even those, you're not going to display every picture.  There are pictures that I have taken that are on hard drives that I yanked out of computers 
[00:28:00]  and then just smashed that I don't know what they were.  I don't care what they were.  They're just useless pictures.  Yeah.  People take useless pictures.  That's a very good point.  Very good point.  Let's say hi to Adam in Queens.  Hey, I'm sure Obi's very familiar with the Rangers superfan, that guy dancing Larry, that  the fans reward him by chanting homo Larry every time he gets up.  I love it.  See, I love when the fans fight back and make fun of the superfan. 
[00:28:30]  What does dancing Larry do?  He's on screen every game and he just gets destroyed by the fans.  And everyone's hoping that his name turns into stroking Larry.  You know what?  I couldn't stand at Yankee Stadium when they would play Cotton Eye Joe and then they'd put  the live from the control room and you'd see the guy dancing around to Cotton Eye Joe,  but it was the same shot from the 80 other times I'd seen live from the control room. 
[00:29:00]  And it wasn't even close to live.  It was probably like a couple decades old.  All the guys wearing big...  Oh, here we go.  Come on, man.  He's wearing these big wide 70s lapels because it's 30 years old.  It's like 1979 or something.  I don't know why they play this.  He's got a disco sucks hat on.  This isn't current?  Yeah, what the hell is this?  Yeah, it's time for Cotton Eye Joe at Yankee Stadium.  Well, if you go to YouTube, you get to see Dancing Larry.  Here's Dancing Larry.  The Ranger fans hate this guy.  Ew, what does he do? 
[00:29:30]  He's known to do this.  There you go.  He just dances for everybody, Jimmy.  Wow, that's dancing.  Yeah.  He just is an idiot.  Someone push him over.  He's just a complete idiot.  What is he doing?  Besides embarrassing me.  But Bernard McGurk.  Yeah.  He looks like a Dancing McGurk.  But every game, he gets his little Dancing Larry moment.  What a douche.  Yeah.  These are the guys I hate when I go to sporting events.  What does he dance to?  I think he dances maybe to Cotton Eye. 
[00:30:00]  Hopefully it's taps.  Inappropriate or something like that.  That funeral music they play.  I don't know, but this bitch should get it.  Yeah.  I'm kidding.  Oh, I knew I was dying.  Danny, find some bagpipes for Jimmy.  Bagpipes.  Ah, there you go.  But the shame on the team for going that.  The teams have no idea what's funny.  No.  They think that's funny.  They put the lights on them. 
[00:30:30]  They let them go.  And they think, wow, this is part of the community getting involved.  It sucks.  And the fans, big tough hockey fans, how about you throw beer at Dancing Larry?  That will stop it.  Oh, then you get kicked out for throwing the beer.  Of course.  Because it's a family atmosphere now, Jimmy.  A shameless vilch.  A puck into his bald head.  And now what are the people behind him?  They're Dancing Larry's friends.  Well, they're trying to, like, you know.  Is that a lemon party?  They're trying to suck off Dancing Larry's fame.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:31:00]  It just sucks.  A lot of people corrected me.  Yes, Kid Rock is using a Warren Zevon riff in that song.  I know that.  No, but it's both of them.  Yeah.  He's there.  They got a little bit.  Sweet Home Alabama.  They got a little of that Sweet Home Alabama riff in that song, right?  Yeah.  It's both.  That and Werewolves.  All right.  More Werewolves than in London by Zevon, I think.  Let's say hi to Brian in Philly.  Brian.  What's up, boys?  Tough loss for you guys yesterday, man.  The Sherlock Eagles have a...  All right.  Why don't you keep talking instead of having a conversation, you idiot? 
[00:31:30]  You dork.  He didn't want to talk.  He's like, screw you.  We're a radio show where we like to have a little conversation with you guys.  Not hello.  Yeah, you were like, hey, tough loss for you.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Nice opportunity to acknowledge we have fans in Philly, and it was a...  The Giants beat the Eagles yesterday, 36-31.  He wanted to talk about Birdman.  Callback.  I apologize.  It's Monday.  We're a little edgy. 
[00:32:00]  I don't doodle.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Garth in New York.  Hi, Garth.  Hey, I moved out of the area, but I used to be a big Devil's fan.  They had a guy named Bowman.  He would always get the crowd going, and he was the worst because in the bar area for season  ticket holders, he acted like a celebrity superstar.  He was just a douche.  What would he do, though?  He would stay at the bar, and people would actually buy him drinks, and he would stand there and 
[00:32:30]  just kind of puff out his chest and look around and talk like he was... almost like he thought  he was as good as the players.  It was unreal.  I don't know if he made the move now that they moved to Trenton or not, but he was just awful.  Devil's playing Trenton?  No, they're in Newark.  Newark.  Yeah, I know.  Or Newark.  Newark.  Sorry.  Newark.  Do you know this Bowman?  You're a Devil's fan there, Erock.  I haven't seen him at the New York.  Do you know who he is, though?  Vaguely.  I'm looking him up right now.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Jordan in Ohio.  Jordan.  Hey, I was calling in about the super fan thing. 
[00:33:00]  We have a guy up at the University of Michigan, the hot dog guy, and every game at halftime,  he'll buy a couple dozen hot dogs, start chucking them up into the crowd at people, and then  get kicked out for throwing stuff every single game.  So he gets kicked out every game for throwing hot dogs?  Yeah.  That sounds like a dumb thing.  Yeah, let's go to Rochester, the home of Brother Wheeze.  What's up, Brett?  Hey, how's it going, Ope?  Hey.  You know what?  The Amex games and everything. 
[00:33:30]  I'm the kind of guy that, well, they sell the $5 plastic horns, you know, the ones that  go brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, when you're hearing them on TV and everything?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll sit up there, drink with my friends, and, you know, we'll just sit there and blast  the horns.  But the thing is, no one really cares, because the Amex suck.  Hell, I think we've won two games this year out of the 12, so I'm hearing no one's  feelings.  See, I remember when I lived in Rochester, and we made believe that it meant something  to go to an AHL game.  Did it?  Well, you got the Sabres right next door. 
[00:34:00]  It makes it a little tough to follow AHL.  Yeah, but hey, at least we got a Calder Cup, like, what, 12 years ago?  Well, did they?  Yeah.  Who would even know that?  God.  And I think that's about the time I lived up there.  Okay, that happened when I was there?  Great.  Good for them.  The only thing I remember about going to AHL games was they had the tomb, and the tomb  was a place where you could smoke indoors.  It was the greatest thing ever.  And it was a glass...  Oh, God.  It was a glass-enclosed room that you could see if you're just walking the concourse, and 
[00:34:30]  people would go in there, and the smoke was so thick, it looked like it was just fog in  there.  This is when they were trying...  I think they called it the tomb or something like that.  They were trying to ban smoking in public places, which they have successfully done.  Although they brought it back in Atlantic City, because business dropped drastically.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Fantastic.  They looked at the numbers and said, wow, we're losing money because people aren't smoking.  How about they lost money because the economy stinks and no one's gambling? 
[00:35:00]  True.  That's pretty much what it is, not the smoking thing.  I think it was before the economy, you know, S the bed.  Is that different, though?  I wonder, because Vegas...  Is Vegas smoky or not smoky?  I don't know.  I would think Vegas is probably smoky.  It was smoky.  Okay.  But they were getting...  They had a non-smoking section.  I love going to the non-smoking casinos, because I don't want to sit there next to you.  It's always some Asian guy just puffing cigarette after cigarette, yellow fingers, just  stinking up the whole jernt with their cigarettes.  Enough! 
[00:35:30]  God, right next to me.  But when they were trying to ban smoking, but people would freak out at the thought  of a smoking ban, so they slowly just relegated these people to outside the building, and  then they told them, you can't smoke outside the building.  They drove them around the block or something.  You know, they made it impossible.  Then they came up with these rooms, like Opus was talking about.  Big glass rooms, some in airports, various other public locations, where people would  go in, and the walls were dripping with nicotine. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  And tar, and just, they were yellow.  And the ceiling tiles, with these giant turbo fans, couldn't suck the smoke out fast enough.  And they'd just be in there smoking, and they looked gray.  The people in there looked gray.  Just, it was like an atmosphere you couldn't possibly live in.  If a probe came from another world and took an air sample from that room, they said, there's  no life on this planet.  Right.  It can't be. 
[00:36:30]  We don't have to mess with this planet.  But you're in there just breathing this in and smoking a cigarette.  That's true, man.  But then they did away with a lot of those, too.  What, the airports?  Yeah.  You know, LAX still has one.  Of all the places, you'd think Los Angeles wouldn't have one.  Really?  They got one of those?  Yeah, there's a, the terminal, I think, that, it's Terminal 6, I know, is Continental, out  there.  And they have, it's an outdoor one, I guess, because of the weather in LA, they can do  it.  It's like a little outdoor area, but it's, you can't get near the planes.  But if you're going to do it, you might as well do that, because then there's no  cleanup.  It's kind of like a courtyard. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, a little teeny courtyard.  Yeah.  Some seats.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can only do that in warm weather, though.  You're not going to use that space for anything else.  I mean, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Three feet by ten feet.  I love the enclosed glass room.  The enclosed is the best, because then you're passing by just looking like, ooh, it's like  a zoo attraction.  It's creepy.  Look at the smokers.  It's really creepy.  Let's go to Bill in Boston.  Bill, listening on BCN, how are you?  Hey, guys, I got a guy for you down in Tampa Bay.  Hello, Bill!  What's up, Bill?  How much, guys?  Hey, there's a guy down in Tampa Bay that picks one player on the Red Sox every year and 
[00:37:30]  just berates him.  And the best thing is that the dome's quiet, that's all you can hear on TV.  But does he pick a different guy for every game?  Nope.  Same guy every game, every year.  For the entire year?  Yep.  Oh, my God.  How does he pick the guy?  I don't know.  He just picks his guy.  It's a random guy, too.  Like, a few years ago, it was Mark Bellhorn, all year.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Just screams at him, and, you know, with the dome being empty, that's the only thing you 
[00:38:00]  can hear on TV.  Right.  Very good.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Jim the Trucker.  Jim?  Hey, what's up?  Pretty good, Jim.  What are you hauling?  Uh, a pasta sauce on, actually.  Pasta sauce?  Yeah.  We need our pasta sauce.  Where are you going with the pasta sauce?  Chicago.  But Chicago has their own pasta sauce, don't they?  Yeah, I guess so.  I had to bring it all the way from Phoenix.  I don't know why, but whatever.  I never got that.  I don't get it either. 
[00:38:30]  It sucks.  Denver has this lunatic that parades around in a barrel with nothing but, nothing more  on than boxer shorts and shoes.  Yeah.  It even goes to the games that have the blizzards and the snow.  I don't know if he does it anymore.  I think he got sick and died or something.  Yeah, he looks pretty old in this picture I'm seeing, so.  He would go to the gate.  You can't sit down if you're wearing a barrel.  How does he sit down?  Just needs a...  Dude, he just parades up and down the aisles acting like a old crazy person all day long. 
[00:39:00]  The fat lump of crap that he is.  How does he get in with that outfit?  Yeah.  I don't know.  He used to be on TV all the time.  How do you become one of those fans?  Because you can't just dress up like that and show up at the gate and have the guy go,  all right, you go right in.  Unless you're this guy and they go, hey, how you doing?  Come on in.  I like to hear from the super fans that failed miserably with their idea.  They were turned away at the gate.  Because you know there's a ton of them that never caught on.  They catch on.  And they turned him away at the gate because what he had was dangerous. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  Like AR-15 guy.  Right.  Or say a Milwaukee Brewer guy.  And he would just show up inappropriately with photos from pro-life rallies of aborted fetuses.  Right.  But they would have nothing to do with the team.  He would just go, go Brewers!  And hold the pictures up.  Pedo guy.  Yeah.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  He would get the names of the visiting team and make him, you know, oh, wow.  I was going to name the fetus joke. 
[00:40:00]  Overly excited tranny guy.  Pup tent.  Oh, they called him pup tent.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, super fans just suck in general.  They're the worst.  Just seeking attention.  Hey, uh, oh, thank you for the reminder.  I'm going to go to Tom in Rhode Island before the break.  Tom?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Uh, hey, I just wanted to call and remind you guys about that documentary from Friday about the 
[00:40:30]  Golden Gate Bridge.  Oh, the guy that jumped and survived.  Yes.  Kevin Hines.  I actually, uh, Saturday night I was home and I was flipping through the channels and  that was actually on the independent film channel.  It's called The Bridge, I believe, right?  Yeah.  Oh, it was crazy.  That was probably the craziest documentary I've ever seen.  The weird part about that documentary, this guy set up cameras facing the Golden Gate  Bridge for, I think, a year, maybe a little longer.  Yep.  And he caught a lot of people killing themselves by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.  And what's creepy is you just see these little dots just kind of ending their lives. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Yep.  Yep.  That one guy at the end that took the backwards leap off the railing?  Yeah.  Yeah, that stuck with me for a little bit that night.  That was pretty crazy.  All right, we'll play the audio after the break, okay?  All right, thanks, boys.  Punch it out.  His name was Kevin Hines, not was.  His name was Kevin Hines.  His name was Kevin Hines.  His name was Kevin Hines.  I shouldn't say was because the guy jumped and survived.  Yeah.  So his name is Kevin Hines.  And we got some audio from him next.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:41:30]  Good morning, everybody.  Opie.  Yeah.  What's up, Jimmy?  Yeah.  I wanted to tell people where I'm going to be, but I have something that somebody gave  me that I think people will enjoy.  All right.  I'll be in Staten Island signing at Barnes & Noble on Wednesday, and in Thursday I'll  be at Porter's in Rhode Island.  But I had a girl show up.  This.  This was a girl I was in love with in high school.  And she saved anonymous love notes that I used to write. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, no.  Holy crap.  And she brought me one that I wrote when I was a sophomore in high school.  And, uh...  Oh, no.  I can't ever take these.  This is...  She has more, too.  Oh.  I want to revel in every one of them.  Yet I don't want to hear a word.  It just...  It's not as awful...  Again, it's only one page.  Written in, you know, regular...  I could not write cursive at the time, so it was written in...  Child-like print.  Yes, child-like print. 
[00:42:30]  And, uh...  Very mature.  She scratched out her name.  This is a photocopy.  She kept the original.  So, hopefully...  Or is she a lawyer now?  No.  There's a photocopy.  She kept the original.  She wanted me to sign this.  That's why she brought it.  Wow.  But I'm like, okay, I have it.  And she's like, um, okay.  And I'm like, please bring me the other one.  I told you.  I won't mention your name.  Um, you know, so Diane...  Is she married?  I don't know.  I didn't ask her because it didn't want to...  I signed a book.  I'm like, you know, hey, it was great seeing you love Jim.  And then one of her friends goes, oh, he's still in love with you. 
[00:43:00]  So, I was like, I didn't want to ask any questions because it would have seemed creepy.  Yeah, yeah.  How'd she look?  Did she hold up?  She looked great.  Sure.  I mean, you know, she's my age.  I love when your exes don't hold up.  It just makes you feel really good about yourself.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, no, no.  Dude, I never dated her.  I don't know that.  Remember I told you the story of the girl I asked that on the phone?  Yeah.  And I said, do you want to go out with me?  And she was like, no.  And I'm like, I tried to be funny.  And I went, well, that's how the ball crumbles instead of the cookie.  See, no, it's ball bounces, Jimmy, and how the cookie crumbles.  It should have been cannonball bounces into my chest. 
[00:43:30]  But that was the girl I said that to.  Okay.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had such a crush on her.  Remember I told you I used to walk with Iron Man playing with my friend?  Yes.  That's the girl.  That's the girl.  All right.  Wow, this girl's famous to us.  She really is.  That's the girl.  All right.  Yeah.  It's kind of cute.  All right.  Dear such and such and whatever.  Oh, yeah.  I apparently had written her a bunch of notes already.  Yeah.  Sure you did. 
[00:44:00]  Stalker.  Oh, I really was a creepola.  You probably think I've either forgotten to write or I've stopped liking you.  Well, it's neither.  My feelings for you have only gotten stronger.  You poor, pathetic ass.  Why would you put yourself there?  She didn't want you.  No.  She didn't want you.  This wasn't going to end like a movie where finally she goes, oh, and some common thing  happens and you hook up.  This is just another broken hearted douche trying to get the girl.  She didn't know who I was at this time. 
[00:44:30]  Of course.  Why would she?  So I said, my feelings for you have only gotten stronger.  When I'm in class with you, I always think about you.  Every day I see you at least five times and I just want to talk with you.  I don't write you enough, which is what probably makes me uncomfortable.  You're usually with someone, so I don't.  I wish I had the nerve to tell you how I feel instead of writing it.  And then it gets a little weird, the note.  I go, do you know who I hate?  And I put a question mark. 
[00:45:00]  Anyone you're with.  Wait, but what's cool about that is you ended up writing a book about that many years later.  Yeah.  Do you know who I hate?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Ties in nicely.  It absolutely does.  You know who I hate?  And I don't even know who I was talking about, by the way.  Yeah.  You may not know her, but she's a real bitch.  An ugly, nasty bitch.  She thinks she's the main subject in every man's certain kind of dreams that men have.  Yes.  In every man's certain dreams.  Gotcha.  But she's a real dog. 
[00:45:30]  Why would you do this in a love letter type thing?  I don't know.  You just put in this venom in there that shows a dark side of you that isn't like one of  those bad boy dark sides where the girls are attracted to it.  That's creepy dark sides.  Yeah.  This is animal torturer talk.  Yeah.  Let's me and you tear the head off some kittens one night.  Yes.  You know who I hate?  Happy children.  Let's smite them.  All right.  Yeah, what a boob I am.  She thinks she's the main guy in every guy's certain kind of dreams, but she's a real dog. 
[00:46:00]  But you, you're great looking and you are very sweet.  How do you know she's sweet?  I don't know.  I didn't know what else to write.  And why would I write, you are great looking, like, like, you know, Palin's fifth kid.  But you are great looking and you are very sweet.  That's why I love you.  This one.  You said that's why I love you.  Yes, I did.  I love you.  Yeah.  Wow.  Healthy.  She's a bitch, an ugly real dog.  But you, you're great looking and really sweet.  That's almost like, yes, I've been murdering hookers, but you'll be okay because I have a, 
[00:46:30]  I think you're the cat's meow.  I'm not going to kill you.  Well, wouldn't the girl take away from this letter the fact that you're probably in love  with the girl you're bitching about in the letter to this girl?  Uh-uh.  No.  I'll tell you why.  It was too vile.  Yeah.  An ugly dog.  Yeah.  But you're trying to impress this girl, but you're talking about this other one you hate  so much.  I don't know why I didn't say it.  In all honesty.  I think he was, uh, you know, trying to make this girl look better by really trashing  some other chick. 
[00:47:00]  Like, hey, I'm not a crazy guy that thinks every girl is, you know, hot, or I'm not after  just any girl.  You know, I think this girl's a piece of crap, but you, I'm not as desperate as you think  I am.  You look great.  Yes.  I'd like, you know, some of those, you'd probably think I'll go with any pretty girl, but most  of them I'd like to open their throats like lambs.  Just bleed them out, hun.  Care for emulsions?  All right.  It's kind of weird.  She kept the letters.  Well, you know what it was?  I don't know why she did.  I guess there was something either really creepy. 
[00:47:30]  She was probably like, she probably would tell her family if I ever turn up floating  in a river with no hands left, this is the guy.  Check this guy out.  I don't know why she did.  Maybe she's a saver or something.  I think my friend is now a cop, a good friend of mine who used to walk at me, ratted me out  years later, like just to tell her like, you know, um, but I said to her, how did  you know it was me?  And she goes, well, you used to sit in front of me in class.  And one time I suspected it was you.  So I looked through your notebook and I stole like a page out of your notebook and did a  handwriting comparison.  Wow. 
[00:48:00]  Which I thought was hilarious.  Spy girl.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Poor girl was so freaked out.  And I had her doing like CSI work.  Yeah.  She's checking out your handwriting.  Bill Curtis came over and we discussed your case.  You little creepy weirdo.  The handwriting was a match with the creep Jim Norton.  And, uh, well, okay.  So, uh, but that's, but you, you're great looking and you are very sweet.  That's why I love you.  This will probably be my last letter to you until I tell you who I am or call.  Maybe I'll. 
[00:48:30]  She's so mysterious all the time.  I like the fact at the time that I was somehow engaging her in something.  Yeah.  Without the risk of her knowing who I was.  Because I knew I was ugly and she wasn't going to like me, you know.  So it was like, she was the pretty girl.  I wasn't trying to freak her out.  I was just trying to have something with her that I knew wouldn't last.  So that you could, what, at some point step up and go, look, here I am and we already have something.  It's not like I got to step up and be like, hey, I'm Jim.  I like you. 
[00:49:00]  And it'd be all awkward.  You could go, hey, you know those letters you've been getting?  I got it.  I must admit it was me.  I don't know.  I don't know how, if I rationally thought it through.  Yeah.  Because if I did, I probably would have said, she's a nine.  You have a Chinese bowl haircut.  Which I did.  I had a bowl haircut.  I looked Asian because I had cowlicks.  So I couldn't do anything with my hair.  I would actually, my hair would be wet and I would comb it straight forward over my forehead  and then bobby pin it so it would dry like that. 
[00:49:30]  No.  Yes.  Stop.  I would bobby pin my hair.  Oh my God.  It was terrible.  You know.  You had a mo haircut.  I did.  Yeah, but I had a mongloid.  I did.  Of course I did.  We've known Jimmy for a really long time.  I can so see you looking Asian now.  Look at his eyes.  Just his eyes.  Yeah.  I think when he shaves his head, it throws off the whole Asian look a little bit.  Yeah.  With that haircut, I really did.  I think you could pass for an Asian.  God, would that be funny.  And it just, because again, it was so embarrassing.  Mm-hmm.  I have high school pictures, which I think I've showed. 
[00:50:00]  They're online somewhere.  They're horrendous.  So that's what I, you know, reality, I knew I would probably never get her.  How many letters did you write to her?  I don't know.  I know there's another one, which I hope she has.  She says she has them, which I just love her that she saved these, because I'm like,  you have to let me have these.  I will just, we'll have a good time.  Laugh.  Oh, yeah.  I told you the one I put, which is really embarrassing.  Oh, come on, Jimmy.  I signed it, like, I signed it, like, I kind of wanted her to know who I was, but I signed 
[00:50:30]  it, like, in Spanish.  It was, I don't, I don't, how do you say, uh, complete douche?  Believe me, that would have been better.  How do you say speak of the devil in Spanish?  However you say that, that's how I signed it, because that was, like, a hint, because  I was an Aussie fan, and that was the name of his album that was out.  Six years of Spanish, and I can't come up with this.  Oh, my God.  Six years of, Diablo.  Whatever it was, Diablo.  Right? 
[00:51:00]  Should have been Tulo.  Oh, yeah.  El Diablo.  Oh.  Wow, that is really bad.  Is that awful?  And then she's got to figure it out.  Oh, who is that?  I think that might be Jim Norton.  If you want to know who I am, wear a certain colored scarf on the one.  Like, I'll be wearing a pink carnation on the observatory of the Empire State Building.  And I feel bad for her, because, like, she probably was hoping it was, like, the captain  of the football team.  Of course she was.  Who just had a third grade education and expressed himself like a four-year-old. 
[00:51:30]  Roping his foot.  She's an ugly bitch.  Except for you, you're pretty.  Y-O-U-R.  Make it possessive instead of plural.  Or you are.  Whatever you are.  It's not plural.  I suck.  All right.  Estoy?  Estoy?  No.  Oh, I don't know, dude.  Hopefully she has that embarrassing one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You probably got it all wrong and called her, like, something horrid in Spanish.  Probably said you'll soon meet the devil. 
[00:52:00]  You know, some kind of, like, a veiled death threat.  I didn't know it.  And the feds have been hunting for me.  We can finally take a call from New Mexico.  We finally need, I should say, New Mexico.  Gilbert, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Gilbert.  Love your show, man.  What's up, Jimmy?  Thanks, buddy.  Yeah.  It's Hablando de Diablo.  That's how that's the...  I just don't remember.  That's how they speak of the devil?  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  Hablando de Diablo.  I just don't remember.  But this is probably, whenever that album came out, I'm guessing 1984 or 83 that this 
[00:52:30]  was written.  That's weird.  That's 25 years old, that letter?  25 years old.  That's so weird to get something from your past like that.  And I save everything.  Like, I have notes.  I had a crush on this girl, Sandy.  In like, I think in 5th grade or 6th grade, I have notes that I wrote in 4th...  You know how like when you were a kid, you would write like a note to somebody that would  come back to you?  It would be like, it would be almost like an instant message, but written on notes.  Yeah.  You'd write to her, she'd write back to you on the same piece of paper. 
[00:53:00]  I have one with this girl, Amy, who I was writing back and forth to her.  I saved everything.  You did?  Yeah.  So it's kind of...  You still have it?  Everything I've saved.  Wow.  I was one of those, just get rid of it.  Rip it up.  Shred it.  Really?  Whatever.  Yeah.  Ant loves his shredder.  I love my shredder.  And his relationships end.  That's it.  Everything gets shredded.  Yeah.  Everything.  I shredded a bunch of pictures and things like that.  I just get rid of it.  It's over, Johnny.  I want no recollections. 
[00:53:30]  I don't want any pictures.  I don't want anything.  Gone.  Gibby.  You don't even want the memory.  Goodbye.  Who really does?  Letters, things like that.  Cards.  Yeah.  Come across like a birthday card or Valentine's Day card where it's like, now it's whatever  is in that thing means nothing.  So why the hell shouldn't I just get rid of it?  Oh, I say, I say, it's hard at first.  Like, when I look back over stuff, like I found recently, because I did California Closets,  so I'm cleaning out my closet.  I just kept playing that Eminem song. 
[00:54:00]  It's just where it worked.  And I cleaned out my closet and I found some-  How did you do any work with Steve in there?  It's so creepy.  Every time I open up, he's like, here, your hampers getting full.  No, no, don't push me out of here.  Not quite yet.  I'm suspicious of Steve today.  Why?  We had a little blowout on Friday behind the scenes and Monday, he's got cookies for everybody.  I don't trust him.  Uh-oh.  I'll tell you one thing.  I don't trust him, Jimmy.  Don't eat him.  His chick made some cookies.  Yeah.  Everything his girl makes initially feels bizarre and then is delicious. 
[00:54:30]  Like, at first, the texture.  Because I put it in my mouth and I'm like, I'm eating a sock.  And then all of a sudden, it was deliciousness.  A wonderful sock.  These are really-  Dude, you gotta have one.  No, thank you, Steve.  No, thank you.  I'm not a cookie guy.  They're so good.  But they're puffy.  I'm a cakey, not flaky.  But Jimmy has a theory that Steve's slowly poisoning us with arsenic or something.  Yeah, he's humming.  He's got like, he's singing just a spoonful of arsenic as he parades around in women's clothing, 
[00:55:00]  dumping poison into our cookies.  I'm just not that sinister, James.  I'm just not.  I really, you know, I would like to believe that I'm capable of such evil, but I can't.  I just can't do it.  This is actually a sweet gesture on my part.  Believe me, everything you bring in, I eat.  So if you ever want to kill me, do it through sweets.  Because I'm a weak man.  They are delicious.  You did search out the cookies.  Yes, I did.  I ran right in.  You heard a rumor there might be fresh cookies around the studio today, and you found them.  Oh, yeah.  Every time they're sweets, Jim runs.  I only had two, though.  All right, listen, we promised the Bridge Jumper audio. 
[00:55:30]  Did we?  That we're supposed to play Friday, but Friday show, too busy, so now we're here on Monday  playing the audio for everybody.  How did it end?  I didn't finish my note.  Yeah.  Oh, the note never ended?  No.  No, no, no, no.  Almost.  That's like a couple of lines.  Oh.  After I said you were good looking, you were very sweet.  I can't do you now.  Why?  That's why I love you sounds like a closing line.  Yeah.  That's why.  Okay, that's what I thought.  Well, then you said, all right.  The closer.  That's why I love you.  This will probably be my last letter to you.  Decided to tell you who I am or call.  Maybe I'll surprise you one of these days. 
[00:56:00]  I'll see you in school.  Don't get suspicious if a friend you haven't talked to in a while says hello.  Oh, my God.  I love you, Dash.  Phew.  That is a creepy ending.  I'm sorry, Jim.  I know.  You're right.  That's a little ominous and creepy and too mysterious, but not in a sexy, I want to know way.  That's in a, I'm looking over my shoulder every day of my life now kind of way.  I didn't know.  No, you didn't.  Maybe a fire at the entrance to your home will straighten you out. 
[00:56:30]  Maybe a dead parent.  I know.  I didn't mean it to be ominous.  Damn.  I was not dangerous at all.  I was just a nerd.  No, I was just a nerd.  Your letters really come off nasty.  Yeah, me and my stupid thick glasses.  And since the middle of the letter had this little jump out of nowhere, this out of context  hatred towards some girl, it makes the rest of it even, like, creepier.  And it's just for no reason.  It's a nice love, though.  Then all of a sudden, it's, do you know who?  I hate people who hang socks. 
[00:57:00]  There's no reason for that switch.  Jim, did your heart just pound when you thought of her and hoping that maybe this would work  out?  Dude, I was the worst feeling in high school with these unobtainable chicks that you really  thought, well, I'm still going to give it a shot.  Oh, the C's.  Oh, the C's.  Yeah.  I was just so angry that I couldn't get these girls.  It was just, oh, there was this red-headed cheerleader girl that was at my school, and  there just wasn't a chance. 
[00:57:30]  Not a chance.  Not a chance.  Godfather, I can't get the girl.  I'll never get this girl.  I'm a godfather.  Take solace in the fact that she's pushing 50, and you're banging 20-year-olds.  You can act like a man.  Like America.  I'm sorry, godfather.  Yeah, my brother sent me a picture of her?  No, no, a picture, yeah, of a certain girl.  That you used to love?  No, that I actually went out with.  Okay.  But she was pretty young at the time. 
[00:58:00]  Well, I was, too.  Was she 25 now?  I believe she was probably 14 when I was 17.  That's not bad.  Yeah, it was great.  No, it was all right.  But I saw a picture and just went like, oh, my dear sweet Jesus, what happened?  What happened?  Yes.  She looks like an old lesbian.  Really?  Yeah.  She might actually be.  You never know.  I don't know.  Really? 
[00:58:30]  Just like, oh, what the hell happened?  The unobtainable girls from high school.  Yeah.  That's why you want to see them at one of those reunions or something.  I used to follow one home.  I told the story many times.  Yeah.  And I wanted to just talk to her and see if I had a chance.  And my heart would just, and I wouldn't like, I would follow way behind her.  And we walked the same way home.  So it's not that creepy, but it kind of is because I waited.  I knew when she started her walk home.  And that's when I would just happen to start my walk home.  And then I'd be behind her and I would kind of, I would kind of speed up like, okay, this 
[00:59:00]  is the day I'm going to do it.  And then I'll, and then I'd have to back off like, oh, my God, the anxiety would take  over.  And her father hit you with his car and then they brought you inside.  You were knocked out for a short time, but you woke up and wow.  I'm there.  Finally.  But never talked to her though.  That's the end of the story.  I just couldn't do it.  The anxiety and the pounding of the heart is like, oh my God, I'm so, what it was, was  I was so out of my league. 
[00:59:30]  And I finally realized that backed off one day and then moved on to other things.  I never followed her again and never attempted to try to like, you know, talk to her.  That's how it happens.  There was a girl I was completely infatuated in love with as a kid.  And, uh, they were bringing other classrooms through to show off our little projects.  And my project was, um, uh, like 1600s, uh, America.  So I had like a little, little scene made out on my desk and they brought the other classes  through.  And here came the girl that I was in love with. 
[01:00:00]  And she looked at my little, my little project and then looked at me and smiled.  And I like smiled at her.  And then she just walked off to the next project.  And that was our complete relationship.  Sure.  That was a relationship in a split second.  Yeah, I got you.  And that was all I had to go with.  I was like, and then I'm like, she smiled.  Should I say something?  Should I do that?  And, but never again did I even smile or talk to her or anything.  It was just over.  But that's the stuff that makes you a funny guy.  It's like, that's those tortured, awful, like unattainable women, uh, make you like, 
[01:00:30]  that's why you're, you're funny.  It's like, because you want to make the class.  It's like, that's the need.  Very rarely have I met some, but the guys who like got all the chicks and that they loved  them, that they didn't need to be funny.  So that's why most of the class clowns were just zilches.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Yeah.  As a personality goes, how did you get that letter to her secretively?  I don't remember.  I know some, she reminded me too.  She's like, yeah, you would leave something on my, I don't know how many.  I wrote, I might've wrote four or five.  I just don't remember.  A hundred? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  Four or five hundred.  Yes.  In the blood of a missing person.  Yeah.  Nope.  But me and my buddy would walk, my buddy Frank would walk to her apartment and she lived,  I don't remember her house actually, in a house.  I don't remember exactly where, she probably lived maybe a mile from me, but back then that  was a long walk.  Yeah.  And I would carry my boombox and me and my buddy would listen to a live Aussie concert.  Iron man.  I was such a dork.  I wish it was a boombox from that movie Bad Boys.  I don't know why.  I would be dancing like Viking and all of a sudden my ears would get blown out and then 
[01:01:30]  Horowitz would go leave my chick alone.  And some I think I would leave in her locker.  I don't remember.  Slide her through that little vent.  Yeah, I'm sure.  That's pretty much what you did.  But girls save stuff.  I mean, that's what girls do.  They're savers much more than we are.  Yeah.  So that's why she probably had it because girls get love notes.  Yeah.  Back in high school, it's still nice somebody writes you.  No, it's nothing mean. 
[01:02:00]  So you find out who it is.  Please.  I would love to see her top ten list of disappointments in her life.  One through three would probably be deaths.  Four would probably be the realization of who was writing these notes.  I'll bring in some love letters.  You got any?  I don't have any.  I got some in an old trunk at my mom's house from my girlfriend when we were freshmen in college.  Oh, dude, you have to.  And I was like 18 or 19 thinking I was going to get married. 
[01:02:30]  And I didn't even know what.  I really didn't know what love was still at 18 or 19.  I remember thinking, oh, I guess we're going to get married.  Twenty some odd years later, I'm finally doing it.  Yeah.  Boy, you really thought that one over.  I think that was the only other time in my life I thought I would actually marry someone.  But, you know, thinking that at 18 or 19 is just completely ridiculous because you don't know who you are still.  You don't know what love really is.  And obviously we didn't do it.  But I got a whole I think I got a whole stack of love letters with a perfume and a little ribbon. 
[01:03:00]  I'll bring those in.  That'll be fun to read.  Sounds romantic.  No kidding.  I don't have any.  I threw them all out.  You're not even one, dear Eva.  I don't know.  It's weird how.  Please.  I'll be gone for a while.  Please walk Blondie.  Blondie is the dog.  Of course.  Isn't it weird how like your time.  Hi, David.  How your time is so like I haven't seen this person. 
[01:03:30]  I graduated or get out of high school when I was 18.  It wasn't a graduation.  So I'm 40 now.  It was over half a lifetime ago.  It's so weird.  Like at that last moment you see somebody who you got a crush on.  Can you imagine if somebody walked up to you and said take a look at this person.  You won't see them again for 22 years.  Yeah, that's really odd.  Bizarre, right?  Would you have like freaked out at the time and like why?  I think I was over by the time I was a senior.  But it was an incomprehensible amount of time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like if there's a girl I like right now and somebody said you won't see them until you're 65. 
[01:04:00]  I'll be like wow.  Some people I'd be like cool.  Yeah.  Some people I'd be like that's too soon.  Steve from Bayshore, did Anthony burn all of Richard's valentines?  Richard never sent me valentines.  Oh, well.  Well, Steve's asked.  He just offered favors in a treehouse.  He just had a heart on.  He didn't send one for heart.  Of course.  A heart.  Got it.  Anyway, let's take a break.  We got the Kevin Hines audio.  We'll play after the break.  The bridge jumper that survived. 
[01:04:30]  Jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge.  We'll do that next finally.  Opie and Anthony.  You're insane.  That's insane.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Jimmy's love letter has brought up a lot of stuff here.  We live dangerous.  Yep.  Learning that these two live very dangerous.  Ah.  Lee.  Nah.  And Anthony was reminding me of something.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you were talking about how, you know, it's pretty much only the second time you've  thought of marriage.  And this time it's for real. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  There was a time before.  And you mentioned that it wasn't the ex that you were with when we hooked up for radio.  Yeah.  A bunch of radio listeners, you know, remember her.  Yeah.  But the only other time I thought of marriage was when I was 18 years old.  Maybe 19, actually, I think.  And I was going out with this girl from Utica, New York.  Utica.  Yeah.  And we had this relationship going.  And I'm thinking, all right, this is it.  I'm going to get married.  Wow.  And I didn't know about, I was still learning about myself. 
[01:05:30]  Still learning about love in general.  And I can't even imagine that I would have went through with this.  I would have so been divorced.  Easily.  Easily, I would have been divorced.  A disaster.  And then you had your ex that, like I said, was with you when we hooked up for radio.  Uh-huh.  And there was a lot of speculation by a lot of people as to whether you two were going to  get engaged, get married.  Right.  And I knew that was never going to happen. 
[01:06:00]  When in lieu of an engagement ring, which you can get an engagement ring and never  set a date.  Right.  You can do that.  That holds them off.  Yeah.  Sometimes that can hold them off for years.  It can hold them off for years.  And then you can take it back and go, you know what, I've changed my mind.  Yeah.  I mean.  There's really no pressure when you buy the engagement ring.  It actually takes pressure off because you actually made a step.  Right.  You got them the engagement ring.  But setting a date now is a thing where you're just like, hey, I got this going on.  I got this going on.  Whatever.  You can always say like, well, hey, we're engaged.  When the career is doing a little better or after we buy our house. 
[01:06:30]  You're my fiancé.  Right.  It really takes the pressure off.  It's an easy move, by the way, to the guys out there.  It calms them the F down.  Yeah.  But I knew there was a problem when in lieu of that, you bought her a car.  And she thought she was getting the engagement ring.  And so did a lot of other people.  And you bought her the car.  And she wore it on her hand.  You know what the beauty is? 
[01:07:00]  I didn't even buy her the car.  I leased her a car.  You leased her a car.  So you're going to have to give it back eventually.  It is.  Oh, God.  You leased it.  Here's your temporary gift.  Right.  Here's your three-year gift or whatever.  Yeah, that's true.  Because, you know, you start feeling the pressure from everybody.  I'm like, I knew the whole time there was something that just wasn't right.  Yeah.  So, like, just to hold that crap off, I would buy, like, gifts that were more and more impressive.  And then I was running out of gifts. 
[01:07:30]  And then it was like, oh, well, now, obviously, we have to end this.  Got to go for the car.  Because I don't know what else.  I can't buy her a jet.  Yeah.  What do you buy her after a car to hold her off?  Yeah, that's...  You're right, though.  Because then there's the excitement, like, oh, I got a car.  And then they forget about the...  Forget about the marriage thing.  Yeah, you know.  It was always around the holidays, too, where it was just like, here it is.  What's it going to be?  Is it going to be the ring?  Like, there was more pressure on you from other people to get that ring for, like, Valentine's Day. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  And then Christmas.  Yeah.  And then her birthday.  Yeah.  There were all these things where it was like, oh, is it going to be this?  This is going to be...  Yeah.  And I'm like, no.  Yeah.  No.  Because dummy would ask me, you know?  Oh, you're...  My dummy.  Yeah.  She would ask me.  Your dummy would ask my old dummy?  Yeah.  And then she'd ask me, you know, what's going on?  Do you think Greg is going to get her a ring?  I go, first of all, I don't know.  It's none of my business.  Well, she was doing something.  And shut up.  Yeah.  It's a recon. 
[01:08:30]  She was doing recon for...  Yeah.  She was doing the recon.  They worked together.  Yeah.  And I...  Poorly.  Well, I'm going to admit something to the radio audience.  Anthony knows this.  But...  Wait, but there was something about that.  Oh, this is the beauty of me.  I don't even buy the actual car and put a ribbon on it.  Yeah.  I put a little, like, toy car in a box.  I go, see, this is what...  Well, oh, now that's...  I think about it.  Maybe the box looked a little too much.  Oh, you probably really teased her.  Oh, this is a special moment.  And then she opens it up and there's the big gift, a little toy car. 
[01:09:00]  I'm like, no, see, we're going to trade that in for, like, a car.  But, yeah, because you said they work together.  Yeah, yeah.  And this is something I had to talk to Anthony about, finally.  But my...  I learned that my chick was driving aunt's ex-wife to the lawyer's office.  Putting me in a horrendous position. 
[01:09:30]  Thanks for that.  Yeah.  Yeah, because she didn't drive.  Yeah.  And I would have screaming matches at the time, like, what the F are you doing?  Yeah.  Stay the F out of this.  She got into an accident.  She was driving a car, I think, 20 feet.  And she hit a tree.  And decided at that point she didn't want to get her license.  So...  But that was like at 17...  Everyone then had the burden of having to drive her everywhere.  That was at 17 years old?  Something like that?  Yeah, like at 17.  I can't even count the things I hit from the time I got behind the wheel till 17. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  I hit...  And everything I hit, I just wanted to drive more.  Yeah.  Trees, cars, I didn't care.  Yeah.  I ran my pickup truck through a garage once because I was pissed at the landlord for raising our rent.  And we had to leave.  Like, my mom was all bummed.  It was a house we'd been in for so long.  And...  Because we were in houses, like, for a year.  And then dad would come by and go, oops!  Got laid off again.  Dad never got fired.  He always got laid off. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  It was always a cutback at the, I don't know, the place that puts candy in vending machines.  Yeah.  So it was always a layoff.  Never a firing for maybe paying for everything we owned in quarters.  Not only a layoff.  Dad, I can put this together.  Not only a layoff.  You guys had to move within 24 hours.  That was a little strange.  Yeah.  It was always like we have to...  It was fleeing in the night.  It's kind of like when your sports team leaves your city, but they do it in the middle of  the night when no one's looking.  That's how Anthony had to move.  That's what it was.  That was our move.  So then when he finally went out to California, my mom was really, you know, in charge. 
[01:11:00]  We had lived in a place right there in Huntington where I remember most of my growing  up because that was kind of happy and nice and no arguing and we were there for a while.  I was able to make friends and stuff like that.  So then the landlord raised the rent and it got to the point where we couldn't stay there  anymore and I was really bumming because, you know, you get attached to things, a house  like that.  We weren't moving far, but I wanted to stay there.  So this guy had pretty much built this big garage where he stored all of his air conditioning 
[01:11:30]  and heating stuff because he owned a company that did that.  So I took my pickup truck and just in reverse went full blast as fast as I could and backed  right into the support beam between the two big garage doors, thinking like I would just  bash the doors in.  The whole roof caved in into the bed of my truck and I drove away with pretty much the  roof in the back of my truck where I had a zig and zag till it flew off in the road. 
[01:12:00]  What a jerk.  Oh, I was just an ass.  I love it though.  Of course I was hammered and with a friend in the car, so we were laughing.  And I went to Jack in the Box and threw the breakfast jacks at the window of the Jack  in the Box because you did that.  So your point is, you know, we've all done crazy stuff, but it doesn't scare you from  driving.  No.  You just could, you just, you know, you could.  Burden.  But anyway, yeah.  What do you think of that? 
[01:12:30]  Hell of a position to put me in.  I'm like, what are you doing driving her to the lawyer's office that he's trying to screw  him over?  She was probably taking notes.  What can I do?  Maybe if he notes me.  I wouldn't be surprised.  We're not married, but.  Wouldn't be surprised.  That's a hell of a conversation to have with your radio guy that you've been with for a  long time.  I don't know how to tell you this, Ant, but my ex was driving your ex-wife to the lawyer's  office because she needed a ride.  Good.  And I want to take a goddamn bus or a cab.  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah.  You can't.  You got to be loyal to the guy you're with at that point.  I know.  Friendship's important.  But you got to be loyal to your guy.  You're working partners.  That was a smack in your face.  Way in my face.  I know.  Smack in your face.  Not that I ever.  But I took care of that five years later.  Yes.  Because that's the type of guy I am.  Hanging there right to the last moment, right?  I never would have.  I never would have held it against you that she did that.  Like that, to me, wouldn't even have. 
[01:13:30]  It was a horrendous position for me.  It's awkward.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It puts you in an awkward position.  Horrendous.  I mean, you're friends and here you are.  I mean, not, you know.  Right.  Like, he's getting killed for 10 years now.  You know.  Yeah.  But it's not like you did it, but it's still awkward.  And there's some kind of assistance going on.  Even if it is a drive.  And I know there was moral support.  All that.  A little sit and beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Back and forth to each other and things like that.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  So, you know.  But that's all wrapping up real soon. 
[01:14:00]  Real soon.  For you?  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  Well, once that albatross is off my back.  Right to Obama's tax plan.  Yes.  Where I will still be paying the same amount in taxes now.  Yeah, no kidding.  To go to other burdens.  Yeah.  But I, you know.  I knew then the relationship was done and I took care of it five years later.  So that's good.  I was pressured.  Because, you know, I'm not an enabler or anything.  Are you an enabler?  Oh, I wonder where I learned that from, my dad and my mom. 
[01:14:30]  I don't know.  Just stay in bad situations.  I had some good teachers for that one, huh?  For years.  Well.  I only realized that.  Honestly, I only realized that I was an enabler for a lot of my life.  Only, eh, maybe five years ago I finally put it all together.  I'm like, oh, that's why I do this.  I get it now.  Well, I work on myself, Jimmy.  More than you realize.  Therapy.  I think I've never said that.  More than you realize.  Therapy.  More than you realize.  But I'm not.  It's good.  He examines a lot of the stuff that goes on in his life. 
[01:15:00]  It's like therapy.  I mean, I think there's other things, therapy, that you could probably do that would.  Therapy.  That are just helpful because it helps me.  More than, eh, I do what I do.  I'm learning about myself.  My girl has really brought out a lot of good stuff for me.  Yeah.  And taught me a lot about my past.  Yeah, absolutely.  Sooner or later, you'll bring that into us?  I've changed.  You know that.  I'm just kidding.  It's fun for the radio.  I've become a different person the last four or five years. 
[01:15:30]  I've learned a lot over the past few years about relationships and things and myself and  how I keep dumping myself into similar situations for some stupid reason.  I just have this need and I don't know why.  Yeah.  So, but then of late, I've realized, hey, you know, that I don't think that's what I  want.  So, um.  A relationship.  Yeah.  Or the same relationship.  Like that.  Not the same relationship. 
[01:16:00]  That's the problem.  Right.  I was getting into the same effing relationships every time and they would go on forever and  I'd be miserable.  And then, uh, there was a relationship I had over the summer where, uh, I was being pressured.  Wait, you went out with someone?  Yeah.  You might remember, uh, over the summer romance, the beginning of the summer for the most part  of the summer, uh, early spring, perhaps, uh, or late spring, uh, and, and early summer.  Yeah.  Um, where I'd heard from this girl, uh, I want to be pregnant by December. 
[01:16:30]  However, that scared the bejesuses out of me.  This girl, well, she figured the biological clock was a tick tock in a way.  Her friends and family and things like that.  It had, uh, children and, uh, she wanted to have a baby, but she was in her late twenties  or something, right?  Uh, early thirties, early thirties.  Okay.  That's not like the pressure's on yet, is it?  Sure it is. 
[01:17:00]  Okay.  But you don't say that to a guy you're not dating for a long time.  Wait a minute.  No, you don't.  You don't.  What was that said to you?  This is like earth shattering news.  Date two.  It was very early in the, uh.  Was it really?  In the relationship.  Yeah.  On the way to the vet with the cat.  Yeah.  The cat.  Yeah.  So I was just like, that immediately like made me shudder.  You want to be pregnant by December.  Yes.  A couple of weeks away.  Yes.  Yes.  It was, uh, it was frightening. 
[01:17:30]  And that was part of, you know, everything else that kind of stacked up and made me go  kind of, wow, this, uh.  So as soon as you hear that, knowing you don't want kids.  Yeah.  Obviously you were having some of that safe, uh, you know what, right?  Oh.  Sex.  Um.  Oh, no.  You're insane.  You guys are insane.  Hey.  She wants to be pregnant by December and you're taking that chance?  Hey.  Hello, boy.  Let's see what we're, let's see, let's see what we're shooting here.  Oh, my.  Excuse me.  Let me step back. 
[01:18:00]  Well, we've all learned from this radio show, you're a good shot.  Uh.  When you go to the gun range.  Oh, when I go to the gun range.  You're a very good shot.  But over the years, I've been an awful shot as far as, uh, getting, uh, girls pregnant.  Um.  Just doesn't happen.  I don't know whether it's luck of the draw.  Timing.  Well, we did a, uh.  We had our stuff checked once.  Yeah.  Mine seemed fine.  You seemed like, uh, you were doing all right.  Lots of motility.  They were all moving around. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Uh.  Nice little heads on them.  Pointy.  Nice thing.  It'll get a bang right through that egg.  Yep.  I don't know.  Just one of those things.  Maybe your sperm is dumb and it just doesn't travel well.  Maybe it's smart.  Knows to make a u-y.  Oh, God.  You know what?  You're right.  Yeah.  Anthony says, stay away from that thing.  No, the sperm knows where it's going.  Like, all right, I see air ahead.  Feel free.  Yeah.  But anything that resembles an egg, back up.  I see the ceiling.  You guys don't feel, you guys don't feel that anxiety? 
[01:19:00]  No.  Like, all these girls might just turn around and, uh, do something, something?  Well, yeah, of course, there's, you know, there's always that, but.  Oh, my God.  But it feels so good.  You gotta be selective.  You know what I mean?  But if someone's legs are wrapped around me, what am I gonna do?  What am I, rude?  What am I, rude?  Wow.  Uh, Pat Fominaki.  Anth sperm.  We going to Brooklyn?  Maybe.  A quick reversal on the GW.  Yeah.  There's some spermicide behind an old toilet. 
[01:19:30]  What bridge was that?  I don't think.  GW.  It was the G.  Sure it was.  No.  Going to Jersey?  Maybe.  Where are the bridges that take you to Jersey?  Oh, my bridge is Staten Island.  I'm gonna challenge that.  Uh, the Gothels.  You guys are really good, but I'm putting in a challenge today.  I'm writing it down.  Challenge.  What bridge was the Bridge and the Godfather?  They met at Louie's.  No, because they went to the Bronx after. 
[01:20:00]  Um, they met at Jack Dempsey's joint, wherever that was.  I think that's in Manhattan.  They wound up going to Brooklyn, right?  What could it be like the Brooklyn Bridge or the Manhattan Bridge?  The Bronx.  Okay, so they were uptown anyway.  They went to Louie's in the Bronx.  I think Jimmy's right then.  Yeah?  It's a GW.  Welcome to New York.  I apologize for challenging you.  But I definitely want to get the answer before I concede.  Although.  I'm challenging this.  I'm telling you.  It's weird.  It almost looked like the Queensborough.  That's why I challenge it. 
[01:20:30]  Because that's.  And they were coming from Long Island.  Queensborough wouldn't say to New Jersey.  Queensborough would say to New York.  To New York.  Right.  It said to New Jersey.  But maybe they used that bridge because it looks cool on film and just kind of like  did a little trickery for everybody.  They do that in films.  I don't know.  What bridge are they claiming they were on and what bridge were they actually on?  Is there any way we could find that?  That would be Michael Corleone going to the meeting and the Godfather in the car with  McCluskey and the Turk and then Lou, the driver, makes a move to get away from any people 
[01:21:00]  that might be following him and does a U-turn on the bridge that is going to Jersey.  Now logically.  What bridge would that be?  Logically it should be the GW base.  But I'm thinking that there was either some trickery or something else going on.  Nope.  Unless there was a bridge in the 40s that's no longer there.  But I think they're all still there.  That's the GW.  Again.  Yeah.  Could you.  I don't think the Arizona was not built yet in the 40s.  Oh.  Oh.  This is perfect for everybody today.  And this is.  Okay.  What? 
[01:21:30]  On the way to the meeting when Michael's going to kill Salazzo, the car made a U-turn on  the George Washington Bridge.  Jimmy was correct.  Which connects Manhattan to Jersey.  But this is where I'm correct because they do the trickery because it looks better on film.  However, the scene is shot on the Queensborough Bridge.  It was.  Which connects Manhattan to Queens.  They look nothing alike.  That's why I was confused.  All right.  The GWB is a suspension bridge.  The Queensboro Bridge is.  Ooh.  How do you say that word, Ann?  Help me out.  Metal. 
[01:22:00]  I'll just go.  Cantilever.  Cantilever Bridge.  Cantilever Bridge.  That was a problem you had with the ex-girlfriend.  You cantilever.  I cantilever.  Puns.  But no.  You know what?  The metal on the bridge.  That's the sound the Queensborough makes.  GW doesn't have that much.  Used to make.  Not anymore?  No.  And for the people out there, the Queensborough Bridge is the opening scene of the sitcom Taxi.  And that bridge we drove in for, I don't know, a couple years every day. 
[01:22:30]  I hated that bridge.  We were commuting from Long Island.  I had a rear-wheel drive car.  And in the rain, you would always feel like you were going to slide off the bridge.  It was terrible.  What the dumb idea was that?  We'll just put metal grating on the bridge and let him drive on it.  Because metal and rubber really work well.  Why would they do that?  Because they're dumb, at the point.  All right.  So we've got to get to this Kevin Hines audio.  Speaking of bridges.  Yep.  Jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge.  And one of the few, maybe the only one to ever survive the plunge from the Golden Gate Bridge. 
[01:23:00]  Part of that movie, The Bridge, which is just very creepy.  Yeah, it is.  What's up, Jimmy?  Who is that?  It's driving me nuts.  Who is that?  Oh, that's a...  Black guy.  He has a beard, but he normally doesn't.  No, he was...  Go like that.  Ben Vereen.  Ben Vereen.  Ben Vereen would have...  And so I'm on a campaign from...  Okay.  We don't need to hear it.  I just didn't...  I know it's driving me nuts.  All right.  Quick break.  Go P and Anthony.  Snatch over there or what?  Oh, God.  I don't know what's going on.  Horrid?  Yeah, someone on Pal Talk. 
[01:23:30]  I don't know if it's a video or somebody doing this, but wow, just a nasty, nasty thing.  Yeah.  Where normally, if some attractive girl was doing this, everyone would be gathered around  going, wow, check that out.  How hot.  Sure.  This is just...  It looks like Kennedy's head wound.  Yuck.  You know what reminds me of?  The front of the face where the nose should be if the nose is removed.  Yes. 
[01:24:00]  It's horrendous.  On the wolf man.  I feel like a wolf's skeleton face.  Let's say hi to Mark.  Mark, what's going on?  How you doing?  Pretty good, Mark.  What do you got today for the show?  Lady in Red.  Lady in Red.  Lady in Red.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  That was a little movie.  What do you think?  A little movie?  What do you think your chances are, Mark?  Real good.  And what was the question? 
[01:24:30]  The question was, what's the movie that you can't put down?  That what?  That you can't walk away from.  Can't walk away from.  That's right.  Where are you calling from?  St. James.  St. James.  What show are you listening to?  They're on Long Island.  106.1.  That's right.  Yeah.  What are the call letters?  You got me.  You don't know the call letters?  Hell no. 
[01:25:00]  Do you know the name of the show?  No.  Nah.  What a devil.  You're just calling for a prize, you.  We know about that.  It's WBLI.  Are you a prize whore?  I'm a prize whore.  I haven't got too many, so I guess not.  Oh.  Why are you tuning in this channel?  I'm sorry, what?  Why are you tuning in this station?  Why?  Because I like the commentary.  Yeah.  But you don't know who's doing the commentary.  It doesn't matter. 
[01:25:30]  What are the names of the people?  The rest of it was good.  What are the names?  I've got Drew.  I've got Drew.  And I don't know.  There's two or three others in there.  Ted.  Oh, gosh.  How do you not know?  When they're in commercial, who do you listen to?  It's what?  During the commercials, they don't even bother switching back and forth.  That's what we want to hear.  You love our show so much that you just listen through the commercials.  There you go.  But you don't know our names.  No, I don't know your names.  That sucks.  He's the casual listener, but you're saying Lady in Red. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  That's a movie you wouldn't walk away from.  No.  Now, why is that?  It's got a lot of...  I'm married 36 years, so it's got a lot of romantic aspects to it.  It's just...  It's got a good story like this.  Married six years, huh?  Wow.  Illegally, obviously.  No, you dropped 30 years.  36 years, huh?  36 years you've been married, sir?  Yeah.  Wow.  How do you do it? 
[01:26:30]  Easily.  What do you attribute the success of your marriage to?  Communication.  Is that it?  Is it communicating with the wife?  Because that is so important.  I understand.  It's so, so important to communicate with the...  How many years do you marry?  Oh, wow.  I'm married 15 years.  And it does...  It has its ups and downs.  I do understand that.  And if she gets a little lippy, sometimes you've got to pop a bitch.  You know what I mean, Mark? 
[01:27:00]  I'm joking, of course, and I would never advocate any violence towards women.  I would.  No, no, no.  That's just...  That's a joke in poor taste, Mark.  And I want to apologize to our female listeners out there.  Of which we have so many.  So many.  So what do you think?  That movie, because it's so romantic that you'd never walk away.  It's just got a good story line to it.  Good story.  There's a lot of aspects to it, business-wise, as well as the marriage end of it. 
[01:27:30]  Look where she goes.  Mark.  Absolutely.  Mark, you sound like a beaten man.  What movie would you like to watch instead of Lady and Rale?  Tell you what, if that's my choice, that's my choice.  Somebody makes me watch.  I don't...  Oh, okay.  We see.  He's the guy that wears the pants on the family.  I'm more of a Schindler's List kind of guy.  Laughs.  Crying.  A little bit of everything. 
[01:28:00]  Titillation.  Sure.  Mark.  Yeah.  How you doing, Mark?  What's the lovely...  I'm doing good.  What's the lovely woman's name?  Rob.  Robin?  Ralph.  What?  What is it?  Ralph?  Another movie.  Mark, we're losing you.  Mark.  I'm here.  Mark, give us another movie that you like, because I don't really have a good bearing  on what you like based on just that movie. 
[01:28:30]  Like, if you had a no-walkaway weekend, a bunch of movies you couldn't walk away from,  what would be a couple of them?  Godfather.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, well, of course.  Sure, sure.  Yeah, it's in the man's handbook.  We're going to be doing a little Godfather trivia a little later, so you might want to  get in on that, too.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, something about a bridge.  And what are we giving away, Mark?  What are you looking to win, Mark?  What do you got?  Well, we do have a couple of prize packages. 
[01:29:00]  We have the Peterson Boathead.  Yes.  The Peterson Boathead?  Yes.  It says the SS Lacey, and it's a hat, and it's got like a little bill on it and a funny  little propeller with an anchor.  Yes.  Sounds like something I kind of have, huh?  I think you'd like it.  Mark.  Mark, do you hate the gays like we do?  Do I?  Why?  Do you hate the gays like we do?  Yeah.  I didn't know you did. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, I can't stand them.  Oh, my God.  We work with one.  So some...  Oh, then you can't hate them, can't you?  Some of the secrets.  What's your biggest secret, Mark?  What's your biggest secret that only you know that maybe now you'd like to share with  some people?  Yeah, I don't think I'd want them.  Well, come on.  No one really knows who you are.  They just know your first name, and now you listen to Garbage Radio, but what is your...  Give us a little secret.  We're doing confessions. 
[01:30:00]  Here I'll be a lie.  Wow.  Yeah.  Lost them on that one.  Wrong number, that was.  Yeah.  Everyone didn't know that.  What a douche.  What a tool.  He listens to a show because he likes them, but he doesn't know their name.  I don't know their name.  I don't know nothing.  That's what happens in this dumb business.  People don't even know what they're listening to.  Kevin Hines.  Let's revisit this from Friday.  By the way, all weekend long, Ant, it's a mystery. 
[01:30:30]  It was going through my head like I told you it would.  You know, the suicide girl, and they call you, and everything's a mystery.  Oh, yes.  I don't know.  Because they're seeking attention.  I was listening to the replay of that and getting some chuckles.  Yeah.  Good chuckles from that one.  Yeah.  You know, someone calls you up, a friend or a family member, and they're...  They took some pills.  They took pills.  They don't know when.  They don't know how many.  They don't know what kind.  Just get here as fast as you can.  I don't know.  I took them, and I don't know when.  It was a while ago or just a minute ago. 
[01:31:00]  How many?  The whole bottle.  All right.  Well, was it a full prescription?  Was it...  It wasn't mine.  I don't know.  It's just come over.  I need you.  I need you.  Ah, shop.  Get the coffin.  So we were talking about suicide on Friday, and then we started mentioning this Golden  Gate Bridge movie called The Bridge, where you see a lot of people jumping off the bridge.  And the grand finale is the guy, he's kind of like a goth guy, I guess, right? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  And he does a backwards swan dive.  And that's the climax.  Because every movie needs the big ending, right?  Yeah.  Even a documentary that is making light of people killing themselves needs a big ending,  I guess.  And big.  Boy, he ended big with that documentary.  But one of the guys in the movie is this guy, Kevin Hines, and we got him on the phone.  He jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge, and he survived.  And a lot of people wonder what people are thinking as soon as they jump.  Like, holy crap, you know, why am I?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You never get to talk to those people because they're splattered. 
[01:32:00]  They're like, they're Pete's on the sidewalk usually.  But this guy survived, and you get a little insight on what he was thinking just before he jumped,  what he's thinking as he's falling.  Oh.  And I remember this now, by the way.  We had the director in studio, and the director was trying to cut off this interview.  He was like, no, no, no, watch the film.  But I think we got enough out of him, right?  All right, here's Kevin Hines.  What was going on in your life that drove you to that point?  Quite simply, I have a brain disease called bipolar disorder. 
[01:32:30]  My norepinephrine levels, my epinephrine levels, my serotonin levels were out of whack.  I was hearing voices, seeing things, telling me I had to die.  I was in a great deal of emotional and physical pain because of my bipolar.  And I subsequently walked onto the bridge, stood there for 40 minutes,  crying my eyes out, begging myself not to jump.  While the bipolar was begging me to jump, can I jump?  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's just wrong. 
[01:33:00]  You had to hit that.  What happened?  My hands.  Bob, where are you?  Are on the chair.  I've never seen studio.  That could be the worst timing ever, Kevin.  So obviously, it was beyond your control at that point.  It was absolutely beyond my control.  Sit down, Bob.  It's not that bad.  I appreciate the laughter from the other gentlemen.  But yeah, it was beyond my control.  So that's why he jumped.  Yeah.  Well, he had some mental problems. 
[01:33:30]  And now we get to learn what it's like to actually go through with him and jump.  Because he survived.  Not many people know what that experience is like.  And I'm sure it stands out in your mind as something that had happened to you.  So if you could walk people through, what is that like from the moment you actually decide?  When someone wants to commit suicide, it is the worst day of their life entirely. 
[01:34:00]  Because they look at their life, whether their life was good or bad.  They see the people they've loved in their entire life.  And then they can't see anything but death.  And all they want to do is die.  And it's not their fault.  They know not what they do.  These are mentally ill people who have to die because of voices in their head.  Who have to die because their medications are off.  Who have to die because they are so sick mentally.  They can't focus on reality.  Some of these people are in such a distorted reality that they believe people are following them out to get them.  The paranoia levels are huge. 
[01:34:30]  It's just plain scary.  Imagine falling 220 feet at 75 miles an hour and thinking that today I'm going to die.  It's over.  And it's only four seconds.  You can imagine how traumatic that might be.  And then your body is basically just dismantled.  You think that's a long four seconds?  We're back live here.  Yeah.  That's got to be an eternity, that four seconds.  A lot of time to think things over.  Oh, you're talking now?  Well, you said we're back live here.  Yeah.  I still thought I didn't see open mouth moving.  Today.  You know, November 10th. 
[01:35:00]  Okay.  I had a moment of, are we listening to the show?  Listening to a...  Wow, that was weird.  That's why we try to say we're back live because out there they get confused sometimes.  But that could be on a recording, too, when we say we're back live.  Yeah, we're playing audio from at least two years ago, maybe longer.  I don't know.  That's a 20-story, 22-story building.  Yeah.  It averages 10 feet of floor.  It's a 22-story building.  And he said he's falling 75 miles an hour, something like that, up to?  Wow.  Wow.  You think he watches his calories these days? 
[01:35:30]  Or you think he just eats whatever the hell he wants, this guy?  No.  Why?  You know.  Just like gave up.  You survived a fall from the Golden Gate Bridge.  I think you're going through life like it's nothing.  This is easy now.  Do what you want.  Do what you want.  Newfound freedom.  Sure.  Yeah.  You don't practice safe sex like Anthony.  What?  You're insane.  You didn't say that.  You're insane.  See, we're on the 13th floor right now.  Right.  Would you jump, Jimmy?  No.  I mean, when you look out, picture nine more floors. 
[01:36:00]  It's horrifying.  But would you jump into something that you know you would survive?  Yeah.  It was 200 feet of cotton, and I was falling 20 feet, and then go, yes.  What would it take for you to jump from 20 stories, and you knew you would survive at  the end of it?  Guaranteed.  Guaranteed you're going to survive.  Could you still jump?  A parachute.  I don't know.  I'm kidding.  No, you'd have to fall 75 miles an hour into something very fluffy.  Would you be able to do that, even though you knew you would definitely survive? 
[01:36:30]  No.  No, it's too far.  There's no way I could.  25 or 30 feet, maybe, but 220, you'll lose to about 190 feet.  Yeah.  I was down in Wildwood, and I did that, like, they pull you up on that swing thing, and  you feel like you're falling.  I was horrified.  It's awful.  I was the biggest wimp.  I put yourself through that.  Little kids were doing it like it was nothing.  You're up there, and they actually make you pull the cord to release you, and for maybe  a second to two seconds, you have the sensation that you're free-falling.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  I was out of my mind scared.  The one ride, which I saw when I was in Cancun, is when they bring down this, like, there's  two giant poles, and there's, like, an elastic in between the two poles.  Oh, that.  It forms into a V.  And you're in a seat?  They put you in a seat, and you're tied to the ground.  Yeah.  They slingshot you straight up.  Slingshot you straight up, man.  Hell no.  I've seen that, too.  That's some G's.  No effing way.  You did that?  No.  Oh, okay.  I was hosting a pilot that never got picked up. 
[01:37:30]  Me, and actually with two other people, and Vanessa Milano, or Manila, how do you say  her name, was one of the hosts.  Yeah.  And she went on it with this guy who, like, kind of had a crush on him, this teenager.  I'm sure the mechanism was all checked out in Cancun.  I'm sure they do a good job of making sure all the engineering is there, all the bolts  are up to spec.  Yes.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I think Comedy Central's going to let us know any day now if our pilot was picked up.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, which is good.  Oh, sure.  Go F yourselves.  How about a phone call? 
[01:38:00]  Jerks.  We did a pilot, what, almost a year ago?  And they're like, we'll let you know.  They never let us know.  That's the way it works.  A bunch of jerks.  They'll let you know by not letting you know.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Remember the phone calls were, oh, you're great, and this, and blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah, and then nothing.  How about a call going, well, guess what?  We're not picking it up.  Eh.  No one's professional anymore.  Who cares?  All right.  We got one more clip from, I know, but I was just reminded of that.  Yeah.  That's all.  Kevin Hines, one last clip of this guy that survived falling from the Golden Gate Bridge. 
[01:38:30]  As soon as you jumped, you realized you wanted to live, right?  Absolutely.  The second.  The second I hit free fall.  And some people say, it's just ridiculous.  Why did you just not jump?  But you have to understand, I was so ill.  Literally, hearing voices that are not of my own conscious yelling at me to die.  So if you don't know what that's like, get a headphone and have your guy record himself  saying, you must die at a rate of speed that you can't imagine, at a decimal that you  can't even fathom. 
[01:39:00]  And put your headphones on and see how long you can take it.  Yeah, it's like when Jimmy's here.  When Jimmy Norton is here.  But yeah, I regretted it the second time we hit free fall.  And this isn't in the movie, so we're safe with this as well.  So you survived the jump, but obviously you're talking to us.  You ruined it.  As soon as you made it to the surface and realized, oh my God, I survived, I'm going  to live.  What was your first thought?  What was going through your head?  My first thought was, how the hell am I going to get out of this water? 
[01:39:30]  It's cold.  It's freezing cold.  I can't swim to my right.  I can't swim to my left.  There's six currents under that bridge at any given time.  And they say, unless you're a triathlete swimmer, you're not going anywhere.  That's unbelievable.  So there you go.  Kevin Hines.  So how did he finally get out?  Like obviously he swam to one of the pylons.  I guess rescue.  I'm sure they rescued him.  Maybe there's a boat in the area.  I don't know.  Because most of these guys jump and no one even knows they jumped.  They have no clue.  The body will surface somewhere, right? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  They usually find him a few weeks later.  Whatever.  You're going out fishing with your little son.  And next thing you know, you hook a dead body.  That's going to be fun for everybody.  You got to watch.  I wonder if the voices stopped like right when he hit the water.  We were kidding on the way down.  Yeah.  What are you doing, you idiot?  You ever hear voices?  Yeah.  Every day.  My headphones.  I've never heard voices.  But would you know if you heard voices?  You know what I mean?  No.  I think you're really gone at that point.  Like people out there actually hear voices in their head. 
[01:40:30]  I've heard things like that are pretty weird.  In your head?  You don't know if they're in your head.  You ever hear like a sound that isn't there or something?  Sort of like a, eh, eh.  You ever hear like a, hey.  In your head?  Yeah, yeah.  No, come on.  No, yeah.  You're going nuts.  You're like, hey.  This is awesome.  Hey.  Kill.  No, no.  You've heard voices in your head.  That's voices in your head.  I've heard what I thought was like a hey or something. 
[01:41:00]  It might happen when you're like just barely almost asleep kind of a thing.  Wow.  They're trying to get your attention.  This is nice.  What?  Hey.  It's going to be a good month and a half here.  Yeah.  The voices are trying to get your attention, my friend.  They've been around for a while though, those voices.  The Hays?  Yeah.  The hay guys.  It's just hay.  They just go.  Get Liddy on the phone.  Hey.  Hey.  You hear hay?  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  No.  This could be the start of some weird insanity, my friend. 
[01:41:30]  Plus he's hearing talking horses.  Hey.  Wait.  So you're alone in your house and all of a sudden we're trying to go to sleep and you'll hear  a hay.  Yeah.  And it kind of shakes you a little.  In your head.  Yeah.  It's got to be in my head.  It's not in the house.  It's got to be like a hay.  But I think it's one of those sleep things.  Doesn't that freak you out?  I think it's more of a sleep thing than a crazy, insane hearing voices thing.  Because in the middle of the day, I don't hear a hay.  You ever yell what?  No.  I never answer back. 
[01:42:00]  Does it freak you out though?  If you're like, no, because I'm like on the brink of sleep.  You're in that thing where maybe you kick sometimes.  You ever wake up and kick?  Yes.  Yes.  And sometimes I hear like, hey.  And I'll wake up like, what the hell?  Yeah.  I've had that stuff dozing off.  Yes.  Yeah.  Or the sleep thing.  Yeah.  When you're starting to go under.  Or there was a time where for the, God, for a while, and knock wood, and I hope it doesn't  come back because it was the most annoying goddamn thing.  I'd be right on the brink of sleep and hear in my ears this, like right at the brink of 
[01:42:30]  going to sleep and it would wake me up.  I'm like, God, I just want to go to sleep.  And then right when you start going to sleep.  You ever get that?  Many, many times.  Oh, is that annoying?  You got to switch positions.  What stops that is you have to.  I was sleeping on a lathe.  I know that's funny, but what is a lathe?  Oh, it's, you spin wood, wood, wheels on and, woodworking machine. 
[01:43:00]  I knew it was something a man would know.  No, it's, it's like.  Yeah.  Oh, it's so annoying.  And it's a vibrating in your head.  Yes.  You have to sit up or just turn around, switch position.  Yeah, you can.  And that will do it.  If you stay in the same position and try to go to sleep, it's going to happen again.  I don't mind it sometimes.  You got to try to wake yourself up and, and go, all right, I'm awake now.  Thanks a lot.  And then go back to sleep.  You think that's just nerve endings firing or something?  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  It's some kind.  I think it's stress.  Here's the voice in your head.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  You got Brian Regan in your head.  Brian Regan's in my head.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  That bit's great.  That's the dog bit.  Yeah.  I don't know that bit at all.  Oh.  Where the dog is trying to get your attention.  Dogs barking in the middle of the night.  They're just barking.  It's like, what are they saying to each other? 
[01:44:00]  It's just, hey!  Hey!  Hey!  It's just, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff.  Oh, that's right.  That's, yeah.  Yeah.  We got to get Lydia on the phone.  Why?  I'm not crazy, I swear.  Because you hear, hey, that might be the start of something.  When was the last time that happened?  A while ago, but, you know, I guess every so often you get like, hey.  Well, I have a, hey, in your voice?  Oh.  No, it's in my head.  No, I know, but.  But you can almost hear it, like it's a real hearing.  What does it sound like, yourself or a guy?  No, no, it's just like a girl, like an old guy, old woman. 
[01:44:30]  Like a, hey!  Wow.  Yeah.  I have an answer from Dr. Steve.  Oh.  All right.  He said, those are called hypnagogic episodes.  I may be saying that wrong.  Hypnagogic episodes?  Can he call our show?  Oh, Dr. Steve.  Yeah, Dr. Steve.  Call our show.  If you can call in.  Wait, which one?  Not the hay.  The other thing you guys are talking about?  No, the other.  The poltergeist thing? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, and you got to wake up.  It's a weird vibrating in your head.  Really?  Yeah, it's like a fierce, it's like a sound assault almost, or a vibration assault.  Right.  Yeah.  We've talked about the paralysis thing.  Yes.  That scares the crap out of everybody.  This is different.  All of a sudden, you're like, you can't move for a second or two.  And no, it wasn't just part of the message of, hey, can I suck your...  Yes, you hear a voice in your ear and whiskers on your neck.  There's no whiskers on that boy. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, my God.  For once, we need Lydia, and she's not around.  She's at work already, it looks like.  Call the F and show, you annoying voice bitch.  I mean, you fine listener of ours.  We're hearing ghosts.  I have a ghost assistant.  Ghosts?  Yes.  Yes, they come and they go, and what are they?  They're ghosts.  I told you, and they yell hey a lot.  I don't know why they yell hey.  Sometimes I'll sit up and I'll scream, what can I do you for? 
[01:46:00]  Hoping for a laugh.  Do you for?  And you might have another girl trapped in one of your closets.  You might want to at least just check out the closets and make sure.  Hey, hey.  Right.  You forgot about me, remember?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  All right.  We're not going to find out what the hey thing's all about for yet.  Hypnagogic.  Oh, oh, stunty.  I did Google hypnagogic episodes.  Yeah.  Right.  And it does say they're normal.  And they also...  No, but hold on. 
[01:46:30]  I don't want to confuse this.  There's two things going on here.  This isn't the hey.  Yeah.  Although it could be.  Maybe it's part of it.  Maybe it is.  All right.  It's usually in that same almost sleep place.  Yeah.  It's a mild form of hallucination, and it may be associated with drug or alcohol use and  sleep deprivation.  All right.  Two for two.  Now it's making complete sense.  All right.  Oh, sleep deprivation too, huh?  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  See?  I'm being reminded that you did talk to Jimmy's You Know What once too. 
[01:47:00]  What?  I don't know how we could say this without getting dumped out.  Oh, no.  Jimmy passed wind during the show one day.  And you answered it.  It was very close to the microphone, and I thought it was somebody saying something, and  I answered it.  Yeah.  Do we have that?  Because it sounded like a word.  All right.  Go find that.  Make sure we can play it over here.  But Anthony did try to...  I was talking to Jimmy's buttocks.  Yeah.  Yes.  I caught a nice one, and stupid ghost.  What?  I said, why?  Because it went, hey.  Let's say hi to our friend, Dr. Steve. 
[01:47:30]  Dr. Steve?  Hello, boys.  Hi, Steve.  How are you, sir?  I'm fine.  Just dropping my kid off at school.  Sorry.  It took me so long to call in.  That's all right.  That's all right.  What is this hypnagogic episode?  Well, there are two kinds of sleep problems that arise when you sleep, and one is when you're  going to sleep, and that's this thing where you're just falling asleep, and someone kicks  a soccer ball in your face, and you jump, or you hear a weird voice out in the distance yelling 
[01:48:00]  at you, and you startle awake, and that's called a hypnagogic episode.  Ah.  And then the other kind is when you're emerging from sleep, and those are the hypnopompic  episodes, and those are usually, you know, the sleep paralysis thing, where people feel  like they're being abducted by aliens and stuff.  I've never gotten those, but I have gotten the hypnagogic.  Oh, I've had the hypnopompic episodes.  They're crazy, because the motor part of your brain is shut down, but you're still dreaming, 
[01:48:30]  and you're totally awake, and you're paralyzed, and then all this dreaming is still going on,  so you can hear things in the room.  You can see things.  I mean, it is so unbelievably real.  The first time I ever had one, I had a giant eye floating next to me in the bed.  Wow.  I slept with a C for nine years.  You didn't even want Dr. Steve to finish his sentence. 
[01:49:00]  No.  You needed that one out immediately.  How lightning fast was that delivered?  What about this hey that Anthony's hearing?  Say it again.  What about the hey that Anthony's hearing?  That sounds like a hypnagogic episode, where he's just falling into sleep.  Sleeping is starting to induce.  A little dream circuit in the brain kicks in, and you're not quite asleep yet,  and then you hear these sort of really real auditory hallucinations, 
[01:49:30]  or you have that sort of jerk where, you know, I always have something where I'm getting run over by a car,  or someone's kicking something at my face, and then you jerk away real quick.  And it's just, in medicine, we have to have a name for everything, so it's called a hypnagogic episode.  Hypnagogic?  Well, Anthony definitely pushes the sleep thing from time to time.  Yeah, yeah, you know.  You definitely push that.  I like to, you know, I like to live life there.  I don't like wasting time sleeping.  That a boy.  Sleeping for snip, saying something a week. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, so a lot of times, you know, maybe I am a little sleep-deprived.  So those hypnagogic things, they're kind of fun, though.  I don't mind them once you realize what they are, except for that thing was really annoying,  because I would be tired and just want to go to sleep.  And right when you're at the brink, that would wake you up.  Why does changing position help?  Well, just any kind of movement of the body just changes your sleep state a little bit.  I mean, it just wakes you up a little bit. 
[01:50:30]  Wakes you up a little.  That's something I can think of on that.  I'm not sure absolutely.  But, you know, with the hypnopompic episodes, if you're paralyzed, if you can finally,  the people who are suffering from these, and they're real common,  one way to break the episode is to concentrate on looking at your own hand.  And once you can control it, then you usually won't wake up.  But those are so real that, I mean, all the literature about people being abducted by aliens, 
[01:51:00]  if you read what they say, the first thing they'll say is they woke up and they couldn't move their body.  And then they look over and they see these preys or whatever carting them away.  And it's so absolutely real that if you don't know what it is, it can be really terrifying.  Do you think a lot of people that think they've been abducted by aliens have had those?  They're absolutely describing hypnopompic episodes.  You know, Dr. Steve, you just wrecked my buzz.  I want to believe in aliens.  Stop. 
[01:51:30]  I do, too.  Don't mess with me.  I absolutely do.  Yeah, but I've had the hypnopompic episodes.  And just, you know, since I know what they are, I can kind of go with it and enjoy it.  Yeah.  But it's so, I can't even describe how real it is.  I mean, it's just, it's as real as your waking reality.  And I can understand why people would misinterpret those.  And, you know, you go back and all kinds of mystical experiences and stuff.  Some of them are probably hypnopompic episodes, although I want to believe in aliens, too.  I just want them to land in the White House lawn with the flying saucer. 
[01:52:00]  Especially next year.  Maybe take somebody for a little trip.  I would also have these things.  I guess these could be confused with out-of-body experiences.  But you're sleeping, and I wake up and I have, like, anxiety.  And then you look at your limbs, you look at your exterior, and it doesn't look like it's yours.  It doesn't look like you're in your body.  That's cool.  You move your hands, and it's weird. 
[01:52:30]  You're kind of like, that doesn't really, it doesn't feel like my arm belongs to me.  You're not attached.  Yeah.  Very strange.  I remember being a kid.  I remember being a stroke.  I remember being a kid that, where I was walking around my house, and it felt so real, but I wasn't in my body.  And I remember walking into the bathroom.  Why don't you listen to yourself, Dr. Steve?  That's wonderful.  You are.  I'm not listening to myself.  Well, but it felt so real that I was actually walking outside my body. 
[01:53:00]  Really?  And to this day, I still believe that somehow I left my body for, I don't know how long it was, maybe five minutes, and actually walked into the bathroom.  I think they call that a dream.  A dream.  No, I understand what you're saying, but it just felt so real.  I had a fever hallucination when I was about seven years old.  I had a bad fever, and I had this hallucination that a train came through the living room, because I was sleeping on the living room couch, because I was real sick.  And a train came through the living room. 
[01:53:30]  And it was, I remember to this day, it was so vivid.  Really?  And I wasn't dreaming.  I wasn't asleep.  It was a fever-induced hallucination.  Yeah, I hate those.  Did you click your heels together?  I had to get out of there.  Now I would love to do something like that.  You had enough trains in your house?  Choo-choo!  No, the opposite of sleep paralysis is sleepwalking.  Yeah, yeah, those are people that get up there. 
[01:54:00]  That's very dangerous.  They're still asleep, but the motor part of their brain is turned back on, whereas the sleep paralysis, they're awake, but the motor part of their body is turned off.  Why do they get around so easily and not just bump into things?  There are people that sleepwalk that are just walking around, like they are awake, but they're not.  They're driving.  Yeah, driving.  Leap drivers.  That scares the hell out of me.  That actually happens?  Oh, yeah, absolutely. 
[01:54:30]  People will get in their car and start driving around and then wake up in either another town or not in their bed.  God damn.  And it's just the human brain is an amazing thing, you know?  So, no other explanation for it.  Or I can't share in that amazement.  Poor it, Brock.  And he's just like, what?  See?  Yeah.  Listen to the replay.  You missed the line.  Yeah, we've got to take a break there, Dr. Steve.  All right, my friends.  When are you coming back to town? 
[01:55:00]  It's probably going to be in the spring.  My partner, P.A. John, and his wife are having a baby.  And so, it's going to be in the spring.  All right.  Well, looking forward to that.  I always love the Dr. Steve shows.  Yes.  Thanks, man.  All right.  I'll see you.  I'm sweating.  Cool, man.  All right.  Thanks.  Yeah, he got the big invite.  Oh, very good.  Yeah.  Very excited.  Enough people said no, so I had to send out a second wave of invites, and Dr. Steve was one of them.  Congrats.  Happy to see you, man.  All right, bro. 
[01:55:30]  Thank you, Dr. Steve, everyone.  We're going to take a quick break.  Continue.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Got just a few minutes left here before we move on to the other joint.  The other joint.  I think we covered most of the stuff anyway.  I see Obama already has to apologize, and we heard the remark, and it's no big deal. 
[01:56:00]  Why does everyone have to apologize in this day and age?  I don't get it.  I wonder if he had to because Ronald just died.  He didn't just die.  I mean, you know, within the last couple of years.  It might have been seen as like a thing of her talking to her husband.  Maybe that's why.  I'm just, I don't know why.  Well, Obama makes comments about Nancy Reagan.  Apparently.  And he had to apologize for this.  We got the actual thing he said, and here it is. 
[01:56:30]  In terms of speaking to former presidents, I've spoken to all of them that are living.  Obviously, President Clinton.  I didn't want to get into a Nancy Reagan thing about, you know, doing any seances.  That was kind of just off the cuff.  Yeah.  Why would you have to apologize for that?  Why?  I guess because she's, you know, in the hospital with a broken hip or something.  Isn't she?  She's fine.  What? 
[01:57:00]  That's because he said she's still in the hospital.  No, I don't think so.  You know, the elderly really hold up with those broken hips, don't they?  Because he said, I've talked to presidents while living, Nancy Reagan, because Ronald  was her husband and he's dead.  It just, it was probably just the order.  It just sounded like he was saying what he wasn't saying.  I never, um, I never even thought of that because I know she was the one with the seances and  the speaking to, uh, uh, ex first ladies and things like that in the white house.  So, uh, I took it in that fashion and not in the, you know, Hey, your husband's dead. 
[01:57:30]  Right.  I won't be talking to him kind of a thing.  Maybe that's just why he, maybe weird.  I don't think he meant it like that, but maybe he said, ah, it sounded like that.  So I just fixed it.  Ah, whatever.  Yeah.  You apologize to old people.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  What's the difference?  They forget anyway.  You don't even mean it.  Just gotta stop apologizing out there.  Sorry.  Your head is so long.  Apologize.  You have a horse skull on a midget body.  Oh, apologize.  She's shaped awfully.  Nice bullfrog, you little anorexic.  Tough target, huh?  Nancy Reagan.  Yeah.  What's wrong with me? 
[01:58:00]  Really going for it.  Brave.  Oh.  Hey, uh, Silverton, Oregon.  Who gives a crap, right?  What?  Exactly.  Who cares?  Donde esta?  Ah.  Well, they elected the first transgender mayor.  Oh, good for them.  What's transgender, Jimmy?  You're dressing like a girl, but you're still officially a guy.  Oh.  Oh.  Um, I apologize.  I should probably wait until the whole question is answered.  Yeah.  Nice. 
[01:58:30]  Tranny is a, it's a, it's a, it's a woman with big breasts and she just happens to have a  penis, but you know.  I don't think that's transgender.  That's why I'm asking.  I don't think so either.  I don't think transgender is the, they completely changed.  Oh, really?  Operation and everything.  No, I, I think transsexual and transgender are the same thing.  I could be wrong, but what, you know, just one is the more politically, uh, transgendered  is the more medical term.  Because pre-op and post-op means they've changed.  What do you call the fruits that just walk around in women's clothing, but they still have 
[01:59:00]  everything and they haven't like taken the hormones?  Executive producers.  I was just executive, I had the E, the E sound.  Did you really?  Yes.  I love it.  So funny, clunking heads going for a line.  It's always about Steve.  Of course it is.  It's either gay or about cancer.  And if not, it's a political point.  We're both just looking at it like two idiots staring at a flower. 
[01:59:30]  Ew, look at this guy.  Can we get these picture up on ONA radio?  Sure.  Look at this guy.  What?  How awful.  What is this?  Well, we got the story.  America wanted change.  This is what the town of Silverton got.  And it may not always be skirt and heels.  You know, it's, I get to be a girl.  I can wear whatever I want.  As far as anyone knows, Stu Rasmussen is the first openly transgender mayor ever elected in  this country.  He's been mayor here before.  Just not with the breast implants he has now. 
[02:00:00]  You kind of go, there's something a little weird here, but you get down to the basic issues.  And I'm still the same person that represented him years ago.  It just comes in a different package now.  You know what?  I understand in the year 2008, we've got to accept a lot of things.  I'm not ready to accept this one.  No.  Stop.  It's creepy.  He's the president-elect and there's nothing you're going to do about it.  Oh, see, I thought, I understand we've got to be a little, like, more welcoming, but  this is, this is creepy.  It's a little odd.  This one's creepy. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Right?  It's not even passable.  It is.  It's a politician now going to work with, with, yeah, I'm wearing a dress and I got breast  implants and I'm going to represent you.  I don't want to accept this.  I'm sorry.  No.  I will say, though, if a mayor ran here with breast implants and said, I'm going to undo  all the stupid traffic crap that stupid Bloomberg has done, I'd vote for it in a second.  Yeah, I know.  Well, boom, this mayor, we're a national show, but we'll, we'll, we'll let everyone,  we'll make everyone relate here or whatever.  He wants to charge people five cents for, for plastic bags. 
[02:01:00]  Yep.  What is he doing?  Plastic bags.  He's a billionaire who's out of touch.  Find the money somewhere else.  Plastic bag tax.  Just tax us on everything.  Just tax, tax, tax.  He's a douche.  And he's the one that was against Giuliani running for a third time, term after 9-11.  Oh, yeah.  And extending because we have to have a transfer of power.  And judicial, and yet now that's, that he's been in, he does a little billionaire with  his own radio network.  Doesn't want to, uh, doesn't want to go away.  And he's got his own building in New York.  That's how rich he got it. 
[02:01:30]  He got that thing, uh, through without a public vote either.  Yeah.  Which is amazing.  You think Giuliani would have won a third term after 9-11?  Absolutely.  Of course.  Of course.  And he should have had one.  All that hate they had toward the mayor went away after 9-11.  Not with everyone, though.  I know.  I know.  They're doing the, uh, they want to put tolls on the east side bridges now, which, uh,  have been free for quite some time.  He's so out of touch with people who have no money.  What a scumbag.  But to charge people five cents for a plastic bag? 
[02:02:00]  Plastic bags.  It's the green tax.  And they said it could raise, you know, millions upon millions of dollars for the city.  Right.  As if, uh, the cigarette tax isn't enough.  Gas tax.  Every, New York City's taxes are ridiculously high.  There's got to be someone pocketing this cash.  It's just too much money going out for what?  Consider yourself lucky, man.  You live on Long Island.  You don't have to worry about, I have three taxes, my friend.  I have my property tax, which is pretty crazy. 
[02:02:30]  I got federal, state, and now, uh, city.  City.  How do they get away with that one?  City's part of the state.  Yeah.  That's what I think.  Well, the city, for some reason, is all by itself.  They can make up their own rules on how much you pay and what you got to pay for.  A city tax.  The taxes.  What the hell were we doing as Americans to let all this happen?  Yep.  That's what I want to ask.  Our forefathers, they didn't stand for this crap.  We did.  Yeah.  When did it all go wrong?  When did we get distracted and let this all happen to us? 
[02:03:00]  The new deal.  The whole thing wasn't based on taxing everybody like this.  The whole, you know, system.  Our forefathers.  Whenever these politicians get up and go, what are forefathers wanted?  It's like, it's null and void when you say that, because what they didn't want was to  be taxed to death by the government.  To the point where they're taxing your plastic bag.  That's why they left.  Oh, by the way.  For reasons, anyway.  For the people that thought they found a way around the system, you know, the whole city  tax thing here in New York. 
[02:03:30]  That's right.  Iraq reminded me of this.  If you don't live in the city, you pay a right to work tax for working in New York City.  I am.  So they figured a way to get those people, too, that commute in.  They can't keep their hands out of your pockets.  No.  They just, they cannot keep their disgusting hands out of your pockets.  Yeah.  It really is ridiculous.  And years ago, if this happened, there would have been a huge uprising.  But we're all so apathetic now.  We just, we bitch, we complain, but we do nothing because there's really no recourse. 
[02:04:00]  You re-elect somebody or you elect somebody new with change in this.  Watch.  Your taxes then go up.  It's amazing.  How about real change where somebody gets in there, restructures the tax code so it's  more reasonable.  You're not paying tax with the money that had just been taxed.  I blame the pork barrel.  Pork barrel.  And the earmarks.  That's what I blame, the earmarks.  Earmarks and the pork barrels.  Yeah. 
[02:04:30]  How about, how many pork barrels do they need?  They confuse everything because, you know, they have those bills with all those other things  attached and you're like, you don't even know what the hell's going on anymore.  How about they get rid of Bloomberg and get like a true, because he's not like a real  Republican.  You know, you get a real Republican in office so that there's not a, you know, taxes go  down a little bit at least.  Yeah.  No, he's for taxing the hell out of everything now because he's finding himself in a bind.  He's a businessman, so he's running the city like a business.  And when it was making money, everything was fine. 
[02:05:00]  Sure.  But now it's losing money.  Sure.  And he doesn't know what to do except to tax the hell out of things and cut spending through  getting rid of police, fire department, things like that.  And he says it's all going to be done without turning New York City into what the 70s was.  Which is, you know, fun, fun city, I call it.  Let's say how to Paul, Massachusetts.  Paul.  Hey there, Paul.  How are you?  Good, Paul.  What do you got?  Hey, I just wanted to, that Silverton, Oregon thing you guys were talking about. 
[02:05:30]  I saw the story on the news last night.  So just to clarify this, this guy, he's a heterosexual male.  So he's still a wax woman, but he dresses like a woman.  So I don't know how you're going to get chicks dressing like a chick, but somehow it's working  for him, I guess.  He's mayor.  Wait, he's straight, but he dresses like a woman?  He's straight, but he dresses like a woman.  Yeah, and it was...  But is he now straight because he's a woman, he dates guys, so that's... 
[02:06:00]  What is he going to dinner with?  That was beautiful, though, because they show the guy walking down the street, you know,  and he's got, he's got, like, high heels on and, like, these purple tights, and it was  just this hideous get-up, and the guy's got, like, he's got, like, red hair and this kind  of goose waddle on his neck, too, and ugly-looking dude dressed up as a girl.  I like to wear women's clothes.  Look, I'm not accepting this one.  It took me to almost 40 to accept the gay.  I'm not accepting the transgender. 
[02:06:30]  He should be...  I'm not ready.  He should be singing, we're not going to take it.  Right.  Yeah, you're a real hot-looking man.  Why do we have to accept the transgender?  This has got to stop with the acceptance.  We're done accepting.  Yeah, I think you guys were, uh, or, someone was right when they said, yeah, transgender  is, you change everything.  All the equipment changes.  This guy's just a cross-dresser.  He looks like Eric Idle, uh, Iraq pointed out, and he really does.  He looks, uh, wow.  Not a good-looking woman.  He doesn't even understand when you become an older woman, because, like, technically he's 
[02:07:00]  an older woman, right, because he's an older man, that you don't grow your hair long anymore.  They cut that crap.  Yeah.  Cut your hair.  But they try to be, like, as womanly as possible, so they've got to grow the hair out.  Right.  Speaking of which, almost roulette.  Hopefully it happens today.  Oh, we'll be looking.  Waiting for that person.  Nice, sunny day.  He'll be out there.  We'll be looking.  Here's the second part of that story.  I do think it was a real gradual exposure to Stu's lifestyle that really made it easy for  people here in town to not have an issue with that. 
[02:07:30]  The issue for Stu now is as much the city's sewer system as whether his shoes match his  bag.  Nails always done.  You may even see him with makeup.  You know, when I look at myself when I'm wearing makeup on, I know I look a lot better.  But it's not a daily ritual.  Let's be honest about it.  Most people start with the legs, end up at the cleavage, and don't even notice that I  have a face.  What he really hopes people notice is how much he loves this little town.  Who doesn't notice?  You look like Gene Hackman.  Just stop it.  You delusional ass.  He actually thinks they're looking at his legs and his cleavage. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, they're looking at my legs and my cleavage.  Never even make it up to the face.  Do they?  Really?  I doubt it.  Well, this is the hell we're in.  Every phone is ringing.  We could easily give these fine folks another 20 minutes of radio, maybe a half hour.  I mean, every line is lit.  Wants to talk about taxes and this thing and other things.  But they're starting to insist that we finish before nine now.  Yeah, we got it.  Call us on SiriusXM.  We're still around for another two hours.  So they could start the music that people are obviously listening to, right? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Right, Stump Brain?  Yeah.  I'm talking about the station here in New York.  Wednesday, I'll be at Barnes & Noble in Staten Island.  Thursday, I'll be at Borders in Rhode Island.  And then Friday, I'm up in Boston.  So I'll see Toucher and Rich in the afternoon up there.  So I'm happy to be getting back up to Boston.  All right.  Go screw.  Me?  No.  Okay.  Okay.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go. 
[02:09:00]  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Thank you. 
[02:09:30]  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Just ran into the studio.  Oh, yeah.  How about you turn that off?  Thank you.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:10:00]  Stump Brain just sent me an email because we were talking about taxes just before the break,  and this is just amazing.  He gave me a whole list of things that weren't taxed 100 years ago.  I know 100 years is looking back pretty far, obviously, but none of these existed 100 years ago  because we all feel like we're getting taxed up the ass, up the east.  Accounts Receivable Tax, Building Permit Tax, CDL License Tax, Cigarette Tax, Corporate Income Tax,  Dog License Tax, Federal Income Tax, Federal Unemployment Tax, Fishing License Tax, Food License Tax, 
[02:10:30]  Fuel Permit Tax, Gasoline Tax, Hunting License Tax, Inheritance Tax, Inventory Tax, IRS Interest Charges.  That's a tax on top of tax, by the way.  Yes, IRS Penalties Tax on top of tax, Liquor Tax, Luxury Tax, Marriage License Tax.  We're only in the M's, my friends.  Medicare Tax, Property Tax, Real Estate Tax, Service Charge Taxes, Social Security Tax, Road Usage Tax, 
[02:11:00]  Sales Taxes, Recreational Vehicle Tax, School Tax, State Income Tax, State Unemployment Tax,  Telephone Federal Excise Tax, Telephone Federal Universal Service Fee Tax,  Telephone Federal State and Local Surcharge Tax, Telephone Minimum Usage Surcharge Tax,  Telephone Recurring and Non-Recurring Charges Tax, Telephone State and Local Tax,  Telephone Usage Charge Tax.  Gee, they really fuck you with the phones.  Utility Tax, Vehicle License Registration Tax, Vehicle Sales Tax, Watercraft Registration Tax, 
[02:11:30]  Well Permit Tax, Workers Compensation Tax.  All those taxes weren't around 100 years ago.  Well, which really isn't that long ago because, you know, a lot of us still have a grandma around.  That's basically grandma's grandma we're talking about.  Yeah.  You didn't have to deal with that shit.  Is that amazing?  And now we're doing the plastic bag tax here in New York City.  Yeah, let's get five cents for every plastic bag that you use.  Yeah.  So what, you go to the grocery store.  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  And you get, let's see, five plastic bags full of stuff.  Mm-hmm.  You pay an extra five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five.  I said five bags.  Oh.  Five, ten, fifteen, twenty-five.  Yeah, I know.  Oh.  Twenty-five cents.  Yeah.  That goes to the city.  Yeah.  It's more the annoyance of it, but it also goes with your theory, with all these tiny  little taxes they do, you start adding them up, and it starts taking a major chunk of your 
[02:12:30]  money away.  Like, I didn't understand taxes until Anthony explained it very easily for me, like the  whole boiling a lobster slowly.  The lobster's going to sit there, and it's going to enjoy its time in the pot.  Yeah.  You know, for the most part.  Yeah.  And it goes, just imagine if the government just threw all these taxes at once at you.  Mm-hmm.  That would be like throwing a lobster in a boiling pot of water right away.  Yeah. 
[02:13:00]  Instantly.  You would be losing your effing mind, but if you're in the water and it's slowly getting  hotter, what do you know?  You don't know much.  Slowly gets hotter.  Brilliant.  The analogy was usually a frog.  Was it a frog?  Yeah, because you put the frog in.  Yeah, frog.  Because they're tastier than frogs.  Yeah, who wants to boil a frog?  You're right.  Who doesn't?  But the frog, yeah.  You slowly turn the heat up, you just go swim around.  Yeah, because the stupid lobster never even causes a commotion.  You're right.  They don't care.  They're little rubber banded together claws.  They're like, yeah, oh well, I'll just go to sleep slowly here.  Whatever. 
[02:13:30]  Looking so bad and tasting so good.  They can't even do bug eyes because they already have bug eyes.  Yeah.  So they can't even go like with their eyes.  What?  You try to tell me if a crustacean is happy or sad.  Yeah.  Who could tell?  You know how you can tell?  How?  If they're being eaten, they're sad.  Yeah.  If they're not being eaten, they're happy.  Yeah.  If they're like just being mollusks.  Mollusks.  At the bottom of the ocean.  Yeah.  Scuttling along silent sea floors.  As citizens of this great country, we just let them just, we just let them take a big 
[02:14:00]  strap on and shove it up our asses.  Yeah.  Without even saying.  Fuck yeah.  Without even saying, what are you doing?  What's this?  Like Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred.  Hey, what's up, boys?  One in Ron and Fez's regular on the phone.  Yeah.  I remember the days when he used to be an Opie and Anthony regular.  Take my clothes once in a while.  They're nice for their fans.  Yeah.  Ronnie's smart.  He actually, you know, treats the listeners like gold.  We should learn from that. 
[02:14:30]  He does.  And congratulations on the upcoming wedding.  I just came back for my 20th anniversary.  Congratulations, sir.  Well, if more people say they're not coming to the wedding, I might get down and like  Fred from Brooklyn and you might get the invite, my friend.  Glad to be at the bottom of the barrel.  I actually sent one out to Eastside Dave.  That's how many people are saying no to me.  Wow.  No one said no to you today.  Nah, I'm just trying to make fun radio, but I did give Eastside Dave one.  What's up, Fred?  The Democrats ran Congress from the early 40s to the 90s, so you can blame all those  taxes on them. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  But second, you miss a quarter at a parking meter.  A quarter.  Yep.  How can they hit you with $150 because you missed a quarter?  You missed a quarter.  Why do we accept that?  Why are we raising bloody hell?  I'm like, okay.  And who did we vote in that did that and everything was fine?  Was that one of those earmarks or pork barrels?  A pork barrel.  And the city just hired 200 more traffic agents.  And they doubled the meters. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Did they really?  Yeah.  Where not only will they ticket you and tow you, but then you have to pay the towing fee  plus everything that you owe prior to get your car back.  For what?  I bet, I bet, I believe the parking meter now for a quarter gets you seven minutes or  something like that.  It's an insane...  Yeah, it's less than 10.  You're right.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  And it only gets up to four quarters.  So if you're running a little late, you pay an extra $150 because you missed a quarter.  They'd rather you just, yeah, you have to get a ticket and then leave for the next 
[02:16:00]  set to park there.  What percentage is that of times what you missed?  That's fucking crazy.  There is no other business that can perform like that.  Yeah.  You sit there.  If you miss feeding the quarter, then guess what?  You owe a quarter.  That's how I think in this world.  How does that turn into a $150 fine?  Plus towing charges and everything else.  Maybe they want to make it so painful that you don't miss.  It's obviously a way to fucking hijack you for money. 
[02:16:30]  It's all about making money for the city.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's what Bloomberg wants.  I was one of these saps that had to do the alternate side of the street parking for a  bunch of years here in New York.  And the excuse was because they need to, you know, clean the streets.  Yeah.  But most days they don't clean the street.  It's all about trying to catch you parking illegally to make money for the city.  So why don't you at least, why don't you just say that with this, without saying that  it's about keeping the roads clean.  It's bullshit.  And if they do clean the streets, it's the last five minutes. 
[02:17:00]  Right.  Yeah, he's right about that.  You sit there forever, ever.  And then you've got a nice spot on the side you want to park on now.  And now you've got to move it because, you know, they make your life a living hell.  Now the sweepers come through.  And just a word to the wise who live in New York who have to deal with alternate side  of the street parking.  If you have to move your car for alternate side and there's no spots, don't take your  chances at a hydrant or blocking a crosswalk because that fine is $115 if you do that.  However, if you just leave your car on the wrong side of the street, it's a $35 ticket. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  So you'll actually save money by just leaving your car on the wrong side of the road and  just leaving it there.  Or deal with one of those shitty green stickers that they put on your window.  Why doesn't the mayor just come out and go, look, we need money and this is why we do  these things to try to catch you screwing up so we can make money for the city.  None of this, like, they're trying to keep the streets clean.  Bullshit.  The street cleaners come through.  Stop it.  They do have those guys because they have to prove that that's why they're, quote, doing  this.  And then they said they're doing less street cleaning, too. 
[02:18:00]  Right.  Because of the budget.  So they're cutting back on street cleaning.  All right.  So then we don't need alternate side of the street parking anymore if they're cleaning the streets  less.  Double the fines.  Yeah, exactly.  But how do they justify putting a fucking sticker on your window?  How is that not mandalism?  You can't just peel off.  Right.  You need a razor to take that off or else it stays on.  You can't just peel it off.  How is that not vandalism?  It's complete vandalism.  Defacing your property.  You know, we should talk.  There's other ones out there.  Like, I used to commute on a train, Long Island Railroad.  Why is it that if I don't buy my ticket ahead of time and I buy it on the train because 
[02:18:30]  I'm rushing or the lines, by the way, are too long because they do that on purpose.  They have two guys working the lines during rush hour.  So you as the person goes, well, I'm never going to make my train.  I jump on.  They know that because now when you buy your ticket on the train, you have to pay extra.  Why?  Yeah.  Why?  Fucking great.  Explain that to me.  Why do I have to?  I think it's like five or seven dollars extra because I decided to buy it on the train.  Why?  Yeah.  Explain that one to me.  There's no explanation.  What is this? 
[02:19:00]  No.  You know, what is their job?  Really?  They just take tickets and conk, conk, conk some holes in it.  It's that much of a hassle to give you a ticket right on the train that they have to overcharge  you.  They are raping us.  And it's only getting worse.  And the best part about that doesn't work the other way.  When you get on a train and they overcrowd the train, now you don't have a seat.  You should be able to go to the guy and go, look, I paid for my, you know, my train fare.  I can't sit because you guys overbooked this.  So I want a discount.  Why does it never work the other way? 
[02:19:30]  You're paying for the point A to point B, motherfucker.  If you got to ride on the roof.  I'm sure that's what they would tell you, right?  Yo.  Yo.  I am open for that invitation.  I got to go for work, though.  And Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, I hate that.  Oh.  He does that on PalTalk all the time.  Like, I'll just be sitting there and no one will be talking.  Yeah.  And you'll have the volume up.  Yeah.  I'll be doing something else.  Have PalTalk on in the background.  Yeah.  And then he comes out and just plays that scream, and it just goes right through you. 
[02:20:00]  Is that the hot dog woman?  I don't know.  Is that the scream from the hot dog girl?  I didn't hear the groovy music.  I don't think so.  That sounds like one of those that's in the background during one of those nice, peaceful  scenes that you watch.  The little email tells you, watch closely, and you'll see something.  Yeah.  And then the creepy face comes up in the scream.  Second challenge of the day.  I'm going with hot dog woman screaming.  Yeah, I don't think that's her.  No, I think it's the.  All right, I'm going to lose this one.  I think it's the screaming, like when you're watching a car, peacefully driving a car,  and they say, turn this up.  Yeah. 
[02:20:30]  And that creepy face pops up.  Creepy face comes on.  There's no music.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The hot dog one.  There's music behind it or something.  Yeah.  There's like trippiness.  There's that.  So the whole time, though?  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  All right.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop,  whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is a good one.  Cody in Indiana.  Cody.  Hey, guys.  I know I'm from Indiana, but I'm real close to Chicago.  So when you take a train into Chicago, it is, like you said, it's cheaper to get your 
[02:21:00]  ticket at the booth instead of on the train.  Sure.  But what they've done now to fuck you in the ass is they've shut down all the ticket  booths, so you have to buy this shit on the train.  I wonder.  So why don't they give you the same price that you would have got from the ticket booth?  Why?  Because there's no.  And there's no way around this.  We just have to take it.  We have no recourse.  We have no recourse.  Eat it.  You just got to eat it.  I wonder if they do that.  Their reasoning is, let's see.  A, it gives them a more accurate count of how people are going to be on the train if they 
[02:21:30]  have the tickets sold in advance.  It's all about making more money for the company.  Jimmy.  Yeah, but they don't say that, so I'm trying to go with their reason.  Yeah.  Oh, you're trying to go with their reason.  Okay.  A conductor, if everyone's buying on the train, you have to hire more conductors or a lot  more people to take the tickets on the train, so maybe they're afraid that would raise  costs.  I mean, that could be their reason, too.  What else is the conductor doing?  Nothing.  He's a hole-punching fruit.  It's like, just fucking, here it is.  You're here to take my ticket.  Well, maybe they don't want that much cash on the train, where all of a sudden the cash becomes 
[02:22:00]  vulnerable.  But Jesse James is going to come and drive by.  Jesse James killed my father.  Oh, shall we say the Brady Bunch?  Yeah.  Speaking of trains, I've been taking a lot of trains back and forth to Philly in the  last few weeks, right?  And you know, we've all done the quiet car on Amtrak.  Oh, yeah.  The quiet car.  What cracks me up about the quiet car, which is a great invention, you go on that car,  no cell phones, you can't really, you have to whisper if you're talking to someone.  It's nice if you're like kind of tired and just want to be, you know, on the train and 
[02:22:30]  mellow and stuff.  But what's so funny about the quiet car, you're sitting there and it's very tranquil and you're  like, no cell phones, no babies crying, no loud conversations.  And then all of a sudden, I want to remind everybody that you're on the quiet car.  Yeah, thanks.  No cell phones allowed.  Keep your talking to a minimum.  And they make this announcement every like, every stop.  It's like you're defeating the purpose of the quiet car yourselves, you dopes.  I guess if they didn't do that, though, all the time, there'd be people yapping on their 
[02:23:00]  phones.  Yeah.  Can't stay away from yapping on their phones for three fucking seconds.  Let's go to Clint in New Jersey.  Clint.  Yeah, I have a Jeep and my top was off and the doors were off.  So the cop put the fucking green sticker on the body of my Jeep.  Oh.  Yeah.  Those stickers are the worst.  How is that not vandalism?  I would love somebody to call up.  Yeah, the paint come off.  How is that not fucking defacing somebody's property? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  And most of the cars they put those stickers on, you had no choice.  You broke down the side of the road and you finally get your buddy to help you get your  car or a tow truck and you get back and they had that giant sticker on there.  Like you decided I needed to park here for a couple hours because I had errands to run.  Not only that, but it is a punishment before your trial.  Right.  It's a type of punishment that you're getting before you're found guilty.  I could plead innocent on a ticket and based on the accuracy of the ticket or a couple 
[02:24:00]  of other factors, I might get out of that ticket where it never existed.  But I'm still penalized and had to remove, I had to sit there with a razor or whatever,  remove this sticker that, you know, the scarlet letter that was put on my vehicle for parking  fucked up.  So you're actually being prosecuted before a trial.  Public humiliation.  Yeah.  And what if, and you're right, it's a good point.  It is punishment first.  What if the guy's watch is off?  That's what courts are for. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  What if the guy's watch is off and you're technically not in the spot at the wrong time,  but his watch is five minutes off?  Yeah.  Now, that's an extreme example, but that's why you don't penalize before the judgment  is made.  Yeah.  Sure.  How fucking dare those scumbags.  Well, how much money do those stickers cost?  You know, that's in the budget.  How about you save a little money and fucking throw those things out?  Right.  I wonder how many, I'd love to know how many of those drivers have gotten their fucking  teeth knocked out by putting one of those on the Mercedes window or something.  And the guy is walking to the car when that happens and you see that they just put a sticker. 
[02:25:00]  Please tell me that somebody out there has drilled their fist into the cheekbone of one  of these fucking vandals.  You know, we all respect cops on this show, but they made the stupid meter maids look like  cops now.  So, you know, you don't know if you're messing with a real cop.  Oh, you know, you just look down if they have a walkie-talkie instead of a gun.  They used to be called, what, brownies or whatever, but they made them, quote, part  of the NYPD.  You see a walkie-talkie instead of a gun?  You have no respect for them. 
[02:25:30]  None.  No one respects them.  Fuck them.  Let's go to Toronto.  Mike.  Yeah, hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey.  I want to welcome Mike, our first racist call of the morning.  How you doing?  Hey, I got a really good parking meter story for you, but before I defend Canadians a little  bit first real quick.  Those guys, last week, I think they were putting you on a little bit.  I think they were just piling on to have fun, because the average guy up here doesn't really  talk that way, you know, about different colors and stuff.  It's a lot more tolerant than they were letting on. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  But anyway, back to my parking meter story.  There was a law up here a couple of years ago.  The mayor in Toronto had the parking guys stopping good Samaritans from putting quarters  in a meter.  If a meter was going to run out, there was this clown that would walk around and he would  put a meter in the meter to save somebody from getting a big ticket.  Yeah.  And the mayor put a stop to it, and it was a big court for a while, but he was really  intent on enforcing it, but he was a filthy dude. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, it's against...  It's against...  Here goes this racism.  Yeah.  It's against the law to put a quarter in a parking meter of somebody you don't know.  So if the parking meter runs out, and you go by, and you want to be a good guy, and drop  it in, and they see you, they can give you a ticket for that.  How does that make sense?  You're not allowed to do that.  You're making money for the city.  You are personally giving money to the city.  No, because their money would come from the ticket that that person's going to get.  And that's what it comes down to. 
[02:27:00]  And that's what it comes down to.  I understand why, but we've had a few of those guys in the States, and they got arrested  and told not to do it.  There was like a meter ferry, I think, if you want to look it up on YouTube, you're dressed  like a ferry and kind of skipped down the sidewalks feeding parts.  It was his thing, though.  Everyone's looking for their thing.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  The fucking state, they just can't stop interfering.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  In every way.  They just got you by the balls in your wallet, your fucking ass.  Hold on, hold on, Rob.  I just want to set it up. 
[02:27:30]  This all started because here in New York City, we learned that Mayor Bloomberg wants  to tax plastic bags, like five cents per bag when you go to the grocery store.  He has to go.  So what up, Rob?  Ain't we supposed to like maybe bring our old bags to the supermarket, not rather pay  the money, but just like cut down on the petroleum use?  That ain't happening, though, man.  Yeah.  People aren't going to start carrying their, you know, bags from home to save the environment.  Like building it or whatever.  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  What the fuck?  You're going to have to carry your bags?  Every once in a while, you see one old hippie chick doing that, and you just laugh at them.  Like, look, I appreciate the effort, but you're doing nothing.  And what about the person that goes to, like, go to the fucking supermarket once every goddamn  five years and stock up on shit?  What am I going to bring?  One little bag?  Two bags?  I'm not like some old fucking hag that goes there every day so she's got someone to fucking  talk to just to get a piece of some bread and some cheese and a thing of milk to carry 
[02:28:30]  out in your own bag.  I make 80,000 trips back and forth from the truck to my kitchen bringing shit in.  How about this?  AIG is getting an additional $40 billion.  Nice.  So instead of giving these scumbags that fucked it all up an additional $40 billion, how about  you give them $38 billion and then you give that $2 billion to someone so that we don't 
[02:29:00]  have to fuck?  That's the problem in this country is that we throw so much money at these scumbags.  Sickening.  Yeah.  It's just amazing.  Oh, the meter fairy.  That was a jackass bit.  Yeah, but there was other guys in the news that did it.  Right?  Okay.  Matt on Long Island.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on?  The best thing about buying the tickets at the ticket booth is if you pay with a 20,  they give you all your change in those sack of Juilli coins you can't fucking get rid  of. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, you don't know what to do with those things.  Half the stores go, what is this?  The MetroCard is the best though.  You just fucking, you don't have to look at their dumb faces.  You just buy it on a machine and you never look at one of those people.  Saved my hand too, because I used to punch those things.  Let's say hi to Brooklyn Ace.  Brooklyn.  Morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Brooklyn Ace.  Parking meters are just, what is it? 
[02:30:00]  To circulate the parking so that more people can park.  Yeah, right.  You can get the $135 ticket.  You know that as well as I do.  Supposedly, if they catch you feeding the meter, they can actually write you up a ticket  for that.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  It's all about getting the $150.  I think it's like Dan said, $150 in New York.  Yeah, the big one.  It's about getting the $150 ticket.  I got screwed on Halloween.  Thanks, sir.  Because the block I had to park on real quick, I only had to go to the store for like two 
[02:30:30]  seconds.  Because the sign that said no standing was at the opposite corner.  So where I was parking, there was no sign.  It just said, you know, yeah.  You're supposed to know from the opposite corner.  That's the other thing.  Now, if you park on the street in New York City, you better walk the whole block.  You have to do the whole block.  You better walk the whole block, because they're going to explain stuff on the other side of  the block.  Yeah.  The far end or whatever, I should say.  So I come back to the car 20 minutes later, and I have a $130 ticket or whatever it is.  Because now they got, what, a central parking meter thing? 
[02:31:00]  What is it called?  I forgot.  Yeah, now they got like the ticket, like where you buy your parking ticket.  But if you pull up to some of the streets, you're like, oh, look, you can park here.  This is like free parking or what have you.  But no, there's one machine all the way on.  Right.  And if you don't, I think it's the muni meter.  Yeah.  Whatever you call it.  But that's just another way to get people parking illegally.  That's all that's about.  Not to make it easier for everybody.  Because it doesn't make it easy.  Because people, if you're unfamiliar with the area, it just looks like parking.  You're just going to park there and get out of your car and go about your business. 
[02:31:30]  And then you explain to someone, like, no, really, I did not know.  And how are you supposed to fight that when you get the ticket?  This leads to Carlos in Philly.  What's up, Carlos?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Carlos.  Yeah, that's all.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Carlos.  Hey, listen, I'm over here in Philly.  Just raise our race.  Could you teach me the mamba?  Carlos.  That's sort of our order.  It's crazy.  And you guys ever watch A&E?  Of course.  He's talking about parking wars. 
[02:32:00]  I hear this show is really good.  Oh, yeah.  I hear it's really good.  I turned it off.  It was on.  And they were in Philly because all the black fraternities.  Like, that was the episode they were covering.  And I got so annoyed just because there were parking people.  I turned it off.  Oh, really?  I wouldn't watch it.  I hear it's a great show.  You like it, Carlos?  I can't stand it.  I fucking hate it, dude.  When I see PPA guys around in Philly, because I'm a delivery guy.  Yep.  At first, I'm like, PPA, you guys fucking suck.  Nice.  They just let me smile at you. 
[02:32:30]  Well, in New York, there's a major scam going.  All the delivery trucks.  Now, hear us out here.  You're a delivery truck guy.  You've got to drop off your load.  Yeah.  But there's nowhere to park.  Yeah.  And these restaurants and what have you need to, they need to stop somewhere to unload  the trucks.  And as a New Yorker, it could be a problem when you're trying to get down some of these  streets.  I understand that.  It's like, oh, fuck.  This guy's double parking.  It sucks.  But they really don't have a choice. 
[02:33:00]  So they'll double park.  And as they're unloading their trucks, these guys are getting tickets every single day.  And now these companies, like, I forget how it works.  Like, every quarter or something, they go down the courts with thousands and thousands  and thousands of dollars worth of tickets.  Someone could call up and confirm this.  And then they make deals with the court.  Yeah.  Like, all right, I got $10,000 worth of tickets.  I'll give you $2,000 this month.  You're absolutely right.  I get average a week about maybe seven or eight tickets a day.  I mean, a week.  And that's about maybe $60 a ticket because our truck's pretty big. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Because of the size of the truck, too.  And who do you think's paying for this shit in the end, by the way?  If the companies are getting all these parking tickets because their drivers don't have anywhere  to go when they're, you know, dropping off their loads, the company's going to hike  up the prices on their goods.  How about they start telling these trucks, then?  How about that?  If they're so, you know, it's like a deal they worked out.  Yep.  It's unbelievable, though.  I fucking hate the double parking.  I understand that.  I know they got nowhere else to go, but there are some people with that double fucking 
[02:34:00]  parking that.  Well, they can't take advantage of it a little bit too much.  Wow.  Yeah.  You got to get the hell out of my way.  Yeah.  You got to what, Ant?  Get the hell out of my way.  My way.  Yeah, this is, let's go to Ed in New York.  Ed.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  Good, man.  Timmy, love the book, by the way.  Oh, thank you, Ed.  Yeah, thank you.  I'm a paramedic in New York City, and one time I had a parking, one of these meter maids  that was so aggressive.  She grabbed onto the windshield wiper of the car, and her jacket pocket got caught on the 
[02:34:30]  car.  The guy drove away and dragged the fucking asshole for a block.  Ah.  There you go.  Go ahead.  Direct on the block.  But one more thing, what a lot of the delivery guys in New York City do now is they keep  the old summons envelopes, and they just pop it on their windshield, and it looks like  they've already gotten the summons.  That's how they avoid it.  Yeah, but I'm sure the parking people have figured that one out, too.  Yeah, they're onto that one.  Yeah.  But very good.  I'm sure it works to a point. 
[02:35:00]  Thank you, sir.  There was a guy, I guess he couldn't hold on any longer, but I guess he has a house with  a really good view.  I forgot what state, it might have been Utah, and he has to pay a view tax.  Is that possible?  A view tax?  The guy swears he has to pay what's called a view tax, because he has a really good view,  because he's got a house up on a mountain or something.  Does he live next door?  And I really wanted to get to him, but he's gone.  I wonder if he lives next door to the pussy factory. 
[02:35:30]  He lived next to a ski resort.  Ski resort, okay.  And so he could oversee the ski resort, so he had to pay a view tax.  Oh, I want to know if that's happening.  That's crazy.  Let's say hi to Chris the trucker.  Chris, what are you hauling today?  Today I have a boring load.  I have brand new Goodyear tires.  Oh, okay.  The guy with the sauce this morning beat you.  The spaghetti sauce to Chicago.  That fuel was cool.  Oh, really?  That's kind of neat. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Anyway, last time I came to Year Fair City there, my truck breaks down.  I put on the hazards real quick.  I pop the hood, and I'm trying to fix it.  The meter cunt pulls up next to me, starts writing me a ticket.  I said, hey, I'm broke down.  I'll just be gone for like five minutes, right?  Yeah.  She writes me seven tickets, because I'm blocking six parking spots, and I'm double parked.  Right.  Oh.  She turns those off, and I just turned around, and I aimed about four feet behind her head 
[02:36:30]  when I swung, and knocked her flat the fuck out.  Nice.  Really?  I really don't.  We probably shouldn't condone that stuff, but you understand.  Well, if you imagine Kenny with a shaved head and a bunch of tattoos, that's about me.  Nice.  Except my head's a little bigger.  What happened to you after you knocked her?  I don't know whether I like you or hate you, because you did punch a woman, but then again,  she's a parking woman.  Sorry, I like you.  Why?  Did you get in any trouble?  I like you, too.  I can't wait for your book to come in the mail. 
[02:37:00]  I ordered it on Amazon.  Thank you, buddy.  Now I really love you.  Hey, did you get in any trouble for that?  You know, as soon as she went down, I realized, oh, oh, I did a bad thing.  Reached down, grabbed that ticket book, shoved it in the truck.  Two minutes later, the truck's already running.  Boom.  Thank you.  Bye.  Fuck off, New York.  I'm gone.  You never got caught?  I did not get caught.  I didn't even stop the damn truck until I was on the GWB.  I didn't stop until I got to Denver.  Wow.  That's amazing. 
[02:37:30]  All right, Chris.  I love you guys.  You were my radio heroes when I was on the air years ago.  I appreciate you.  You're a good boy.  Let's see what the business has done to radio guys.  Now you're driving tires around.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I have to drive a truck, and you don't want to know what I pay in taxes.  It's fucking ugly.  I apologize to you.  This business just blows and knocked out a lot of great people.  All right, Chris.  Yeah.  Let it.  Yep.  Corey, happy birthday from Scranton, PA.  He writes, Opie, my wife surprised me with reservations for my birthday at FH Riley's. 
[02:38:00]  Holy shit.  Brett is an amazing chef.  The food was fantastic.  Can't wait to make another trip.  Thank you, Corey.  I appreciate that.  Well.  I visited him this weekend.  He's working his ass off.  We're going to be remodeling, my friend.  Oh.  Going to do a little remodeling.  The French doors are going to happen, which is very cool.  Franc.  Franc-ton.  Let's go to.  Fag doors.  Yeah.  But it's inviting.  I just mean the French.  Yeah.  But the doors themselves are very inviting.  Well, French doors are wonderful.  Because then people realize, wait, it's not just an Irish bar. 
[02:38:30]  You get some nice food.  It has French doors.  It has French doors.  French lessons are better, though.  Ah.  Greek.  Greek.  Come on, Greek.  Who doesn't like a little finger every once in a while?  Love it.  Jesus.  A little finger.  Greek, what's in a while?  Mm-hmm.  Who's this from Brooklyn?  Hello?  Yeah, I don't know your name.  I'm not going to attempt it.  It's Caleb.  Caleb.  All right.  That's easy.  Morning, boys.  What's up, Caleb?  So listen, I deliver medical supplies in the city.  Like, you know, implants for, like, trauma and spine and shit. 
[02:39:00]  You're doing God's work.  I don't know if it's God's work, but it's fucking work.  Yeah.  So anyway, I go up to Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx.  Yeah.  Parking is such a racket up there.  NYPD has, like, a fleet of four tow trucks just constantly circling like fucking sharks,  towing people.  It's just all the time I'm up there.  I'm up there, like, three, four times a week, and there's always someone being towed.  Always.  Yeah.  You got to remember, this isn't like a fucking mall or something.  People aren't there because it's fun. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  I mean, it's a hospital.  People are there, you know, because they have to be.  Possibly, like, you know, one of the darkest moments in their life, and, you know, they  got to worry about their car not being there when they get out.  You know what I mean?  It's fucking ridiculous.  And if you're going to park willy-nilly anywhere, it's going to be at a hospital, because  like you just said, usually you get the call, like, holy shit, he has an hour to live.  I'll be right there.  And you're parking on a lawn up against a tree, and now they're yanking your car out  of there?  What, you were supposed to circle the parking lot forever until somebody got out?  You fucks? 
[02:40:00]  That's the thing.  I mean, there's a garage up there, but it's like, you know, I parked there for like five  minutes.  It's 16 bucks.  Right.  And now I'm trying to save a couple bucks.  You know what I mean?  Recession.  Oh, don't even get started with the parking scam, where now they got you, where you have  to pay for parking at a hospital.  How did they get that one through?  Not only that, but my local DMV office, there's really, there's nowhere to park.  Like, if you're going to the DMV, you have to park there.  It used to be free parking, they just put, like, now it's a paid parking lot, so, like, 
[02:40:30]  if you go to the DMV for anything, you have to pay for their parking now.  That's amazing.  It's ridiculous.  That's amazing.  And you're going to be there, who's ever going to be there for 10 minutes?  Dr. Kaku.  Oh, it's Dr. Michu Kaku.  Michu Kaku.  What did he say our names were?  Oppie?  Oppie.  Oppie.  Oppie and Anthony.  Me too kaku.  And Anthony.  All right, boys.  Pop me now.  All right, man.  Smart cookie.  He is all over Discovery Science Channel.  Oh, I know.  You can't watch Discovery Science for not seeing it.  He's always popping up.  That fat head of his every two seconds. 
[02:41:00]  He's got his big head.  Can we get him back on the show?  We had fun with him.  He walks a hair that looks like a hat removal victim.  What is he talking about today?  Of a power plant.  Yeah.  A small nuclear power plant.  Yeah.  That would be the size of a shed.  Oh, that's wonderful.  And it's good for like powering your house and things like that.  Thank God they cost $25 million a piece.  So maybe.  Yeah.  They cost $25 million.  They pay for themselves, though.  In no time.  I mean, what are you going to...  If you live there for 400,000 years, you break even time. 
[02:41:30]  Thank God the average Joe can't afford this yet.  Oh, it's fantastic.  That would be a little creepy having people all over the Midwest doing the nuclear shit.  With their nuclear power plants.  Yeah.  You know how you let things run down at your house?  Right.  That would be like, yeah, you let your water heater go until it springs a leak.  It's like, ah, I had a meltdown the other day.  Listen to this.  And I want to prove that this guy is telling the truth somehow.  Maybe online we can find this.  Bob in Hartford.  Go ahead.  Hey, Tim, Bob.  How are you doing?  Hey.  I heard, I read in a magazine one time, a trucking magazine, that UPS pays $7 million 
[02:42:00]  a year in parking tickets.  And I had delivered to the Dakota one time, and I got a ticket for double parking.  And then when I left, I took a left on whatever that West Side Parkway or whatever road is  that goes next to Central Park.  Yep.  I got a ticket for $150 for driving and had no commercial zone because I guess you're  not supposed to drive, you know, more than a couple blocks on that road.  Which I didn't know.  I'm from Hartford.  I'm not supposed to know that. 
[02:42:30]  Right.  You're supposed to get off that road or whatever, that Parkside West or whatever it's called.  Right.  But, yeah, $7 million a year for UPS and parking tickets.  A year.  And I know the Dakota.  Where were you supposed to park to deliver a UPS package?  I know that building.  I know.  I mean, I had parked on the side street.  I don't know.  I remember what the name of the side street is.  You can't find parking on any side street in New York just like that.  You have to circle the block for sometimes an hour.  Seriously.  I did easily an hour just trying to find parking.  I'll tax for a license.  Huh?  I just got my renewal for my license in the mail. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  $106 for four years.  And my wife picked a regular license.  She pays $48.  Right.  I mean, why is it so different?  It costs the same amount of money to print that little piece of plastic.  $7 million.  I'm sure they passed the savings on to us, UPS, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure.  This article.  Probably not.  This article I found, it's a couple years old.  Literal, Jim.  But I'm sure the stats remain the same.  Yeah.  UPS in New York City in, I think this was fiscal year ending like June of 06 or something, 
[02:43:30]  paid $18.8 million in parking tickets.  This is such a scam that no one talks about.  What are these delivery guys supposed to do?  I don't know.  Figure something out, though.  I'm sure these cops are, you know, like Ant was talking, if some of these guys just  park and don't give a shit.  But in general, they're trying to do the right thing and quickly deliver their stuff and get  the fuck out of New York.  This is what pisses me off.  Up the side roads.  I don't know the prices of the tickets or whatever, but when I see a space that is in  no parking zone and it's open because it's no parking and the truck won't pull in there 
[02:44:00]  to drop shit off and they'll double park as if there was a vehicle parked in there,  blocking the whole fucking road.  I want to shoot the motherfucker.  But they probably get a ticket for that on top of the double parking.  No, because it wouldn't be double parking because they'd be parked against the curb,  but they're in an illegal spot.  Right.  So it's either one illegal spot or the other.  One of them fucks traffic completely.  That one doesn't.  But that ticket probably costs more and that's why they're not doing it. 
[02:44:30]  I'd give them another ticket for obstructing fucking traffic or whatever.  But do you understand what's going on here?  The scam that the city's got going?  Oh, I understand.  I'm just talking about my own comforts.  Right.  I want to fucking be able to drive.  It's all about it.  That's it.  It's all about Anna Howes.  The parking's fucking ridiculous too, though, because I go to, you know, I go to park.  The other day I went to B&H over there.  B&H photo, video.  And there's a parking lot across the street.  I pull in and they all got the sign.  They all got that sign.  $7.50 parking. 
[02:45:00]  You're like, sweet.  And you're like.  Nice.  I can handle this.  I pull in and the guy goes, how long?  And I go, about an hour.  $38.  Right.  I'm like, how?  And I don't even want to argue because I know, you know, they got their math figured  out, whatever the fuck it is.  Yeah.  But it's like to get that $7.50 thing, I would have had to have stopped, given him $7.50,  turned around and left.  Right.  Like, that's how you get to pay that amount of money.  No, you have to park between like 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. to get to $7.50 because that's 
[02:45:30]  a small print.  Yeah, it's some kind of weird time.  So then it's up to an hour is like $15.  But you have a bigger car.  And then an hour and over, which if I stayed like an hour and a minute, is like $30 or $28  and then $10 for oversized vehicle.  Yeah.  But, you know, that's my problem because I have an Escalade.  But it was an outdoor parking lot.  And the spaces were no bigger or smaller than any of the other spaces.  The oversized vehicle thing is a crock of shit for the most part, too. 
[02:46:00]  That's a scam.  Because your oversized vehicle in most parking lots is going to fit in the same fucking  space as the smaller cars.  Yeah, same spots.  But just another way.  Wait, we can make money if we charge for oversized vehicles.  Oversized vehicles.  I'm not coming down on a tank.  Right.  Right.  What would they charge for a tank in New York City?  Don't forget about New York City parking tax, which I think is somewhere in the 18% parking  tax.  18 fucking percent.  And they can raise it.  Parking in my building is like $400 a month now.  Yeah, I got full.  That's what I'm telling you. 
[02:46:30]  They're fucking rapists.  Just to park my car in a building that I own space in.  Yeah.  This one we gave up on years ago.  But once again, season ticket holder for the Islanders.  And sporting events, how do they get away with making you pay for parking for a game  you're going into?  Yeah, I'm going into the game.  Like, you got the ticket.  Look, I got two tickets to see the Jets, whatever.  I'm not just parking here to go shopping.  Right, you fuck.  How do they get that one through?  You're buying the tickets for the sporting event, but now they charge you to park in 
[02:47:00]  their parking lot so you can see their team.  That is infuriating.  But technically, they don't run the parking lots anymore.  That's how they got around that.  Oh, really?  It's probably the same company.  They get a kickback.  Yeah.  Travai?  What about the licensing fees that sports teams are charging now?  Yeah, that's sad.  Like $40,000 just to own the seat at the new Jets stadium.  Yeah.  And then you still have to pay for your season tickets.  Yeah.  And you have to pay a yearly fee to keep that.  You have to pay a certain amount of money for the right to have season tickets. 
[02:47:30]  The right to buy tickets.  Here's why they do it.  Oh my God.  Because dumb motherfuckers that we are.  They will do it.  They can.  We deserve it because we okay it.  That's what I'm saying.  What would it take for this country, for the public, to stand up and have an armed rebellion?  Like what the fuck would it take?  I think it would take like that ancient thing where the president or some of the congressmen and stuff, they get to fuck your wife when you're married. 
[02:48:00]  Like in Braveheart.  They come by and some senator goes, dude, this is my area that I take care of.  Um, and I see you just got married.  I'll be fucking your wife and then I'll leave.  And you're like, what do you mean?  And you're like, wait, I'm not cuckold or anything.  You didn't read about the cunt tax?  Oh, that was a thing.  It was a pork barrel thing.  Right.  It was a, uh, it's a new cunt tax that we have.  It was a cunt mark.  It was attached to a, uh, no child left behind bill that we gave a bunch of money to schools and stuff. 
[02:48:30]  And you really didn't see it in the fine print.  But, um, if you just move out of the way, I'll be coming in and fucking your new bride now.  Right.  And you're like, wait, wait, what happened?  Would that get people pissed off enough where they might rebel?  Because now they could get away with whatever the fuck they want.  When everyone was bitching about the price of gas and the government's like, we'd love to do something about it.  We'd love to do something about it.  Do you know how much tax is on a gallon of gas?  Do you know the price of a gallon of gas if it's $4 a gallon? 
[02:49:00]  The tax on that gas, if they just decided, look, we really know you guys are fucked.  We're going to discontinue the tax on gas until the gas goes down to a certain price.  And then we got to put it back.  We're sorry.  But until then, gas would have been $2 a gallon.  It's just an insane amount of tax that they throw on everything.  And things they feel they don't want you to do, like smoking.  Right.  In the city.  A pack of cigarettes in Manhattan.  What is it?  $3.50 about.  Are you kidding?  I think so. 
[02:49:30]  You're talking $9 a pack.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But hear me out.  I'm not a fan of the smokers, but we got to be fair here.  They're getting raped.  The cigarettes themselves cost about $3.50.  Oh, yeah.  And you can't get them for $3.50 because you have to pay the cigarette tax, which I believe  is more than $3.50 now.  So the taxes are more than the actual price of the cigarettes.  So it's what, $8, $9?  $9.  $9.  And then what happens if you go to Jersey?  I think it's like 60% is the tax you're paying on cigarettes.  What happens if you go to Jersey to pick up cigarettes? 
[02:50:00]  Not 60%, I mean over 100%.  Didn't he want to do something, though, where if you're caught with an out-of-state tax  sticker on your...  Well, yeah, he wanted to...  You have to pay the difference or...  A lot of people will go buy them in Jersey, and then these bodegas will resell them.  Right.  So, yeah, he wanted to like, you know...  If a store was reselling them, he wanted to find stores that were reselling them.  Here's why they tax cigarettes and liquor so high.  I'm not saying it's right, but this is why.  Those sin taxes on certain things, and it shouldn't happen in strip clubs or where there's a morality 
[02:50:30]  judgment.  Oh, nice.  But if it's a medical thing, when you're smoking, you obviously, you're much more likely to  need medical treatment, and that raises medical costs for everybody.  You're voluntarily doing something that is going to damage your health, which, again,  is your business.  It's like motorcycle riders that don't want to wear helmets.  Here's why you have to wear a fucking helmet.  It's not that I care about your safety.  It's up to you.  But if you get hurt, your insurance, it fucks all of us. 
[02:51:00]  And that's why people who are voluntarily being dangerous when it's not necessary...  But the government doesn't look...  The government doesn't give a shit about your well-being.  I think they do.  I know, but if some guy's paying $800 a month in health insurance and he wants to puff away...  Yeah, I think...  I agree.  Wait, they don't give a shit about your health.  They make believe they do.  It's bullshit.  They know it's an addiction.  They know they got you by the balls in it.  And they can charge whatever the fuck you want because you need cigarettes.  I'm going to go there and someone's going to be like, yeah, it's $10 now.  I'm going to say, shit, that sucks. 
[02:51:30]  Here's your $10.  Here's $10.  What am I going to do?  Not smoke?  They're trying to get people to quit.  $100 a carton.  They're addicted to coffee, you know, and if they, like, hiked coffee up to $10...  Well, we're getting there, right?  Yeah.  $10, you know...  A cup.  A cup of coffee.  I'm paying it.  I'm paying it because I need my coffee.  I need it.  They are trying to get people to quit by raising the price.  They want you to quit because the medical...  They don't care, but the medical costs are too much, and that's the problem.  It's all about money.  And that's why they charge more. 
[02:52:00]  And they find everyone who goes to these Indian resorts out on Long Island.  And if you get caught going there, they send you a bill.  If they wanted people to quit smoking, they would just make it illegal.  Where does the cigarette tax...  Somehow they would make it illegal.  Where does the New York City cigarette tax go?  I'd love to know.  I'd love to know where all that money goes, what it's used for.  Is it used for strictly health care?  Is it used...  Does it go to the hospitals to treat people, you know, spiting them by actually making them pay 
[02:52:30]  to pay for wings in a hospital that treat lung cancer, things like that?  Is that where it's going?  Or is it going to some fucking pork barrel project?  Hey, we're fixing a bridge with this.  It's going to take 10 years and go billions over budget because this guy's lying in his pockets  because he's a friend of this guy.  It's just all bullshit.  It's all fucking bullshit.  On our backs, man.  But you're right.  I think I read in South Carolina, their cigarette tax is $0.07 a pack. 
[02:53:00]  $0.07 a pack.  It's whatever states...  South Carolina.  South Carolina.  Yeah, I think so.  Well, here in New York City, you'll pay a combined city and state cigarette tax of $4.25 per pack.  Per pack.  Almost as much as a pack of cigarettes.  Do you know how much money that is?  Do you know how much fucking money that is that's going to the city?  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's 100% tax.  You're right.  It is 100%, right?  I remember $50, but that's not true.  Well, I guess on the bright side of things, I'm sure some of that cigarette tax money paid for my nicotine patches when I quit smoking. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, did it?  Nice.  It had to come from somewhere.  They were free.  Did you smoke at all now?  No, I quit over two years ago.  God, I forgot.  There used to be a smoker.  How long ago?  Over two years ago.  No problem?  You good?  The first six months were fucking torture, but it's tough drinking.  The minute you pop a beer, you want to have a cigarette.  It's the worst thing in the world.  Did you say beer?  Yeah.  Beer.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Beer.  What kind of beer?  Oh, no.  It's the other lady I'm talking about.  Bud Light.  How did she say beer again?  Lots of Bud Light. 
[02:54:00]  Red Dog.  Even more Bud Light.  Stros.  Mule.  Mule.  Mule.  Mule.  That's the kind of phone I thought of.  Yeah, it is.  I was like, fuck.  No, where's the lady?  Do we have the lady talking about Burr?  Burr.  Burr.  Yeah, let me find her real quick.  Burr.  Burr.  Yeah, I guess we got John along now.  What's up, John?  Hi, John.  What's going on, boys?  What's up, man?  I was working in Brooklyn last year, and I'm driving on Kings Highway.  Sure.  And I see this dude leaning into a car, and he's pounding on a girl. 
[02:54:30]  I quick pull my van over, flag down a cop.  We go over there, the cop arrests the guy, whatever.  I go back to my van, I got a parking and a bus stop ticket.  I go back to the cop.  He's like, oh, just send it in.  Say, your assistant and officer, here's my badge number, my name, the precinct.  We send it in.  They said it wasn't a good enough reason to park in a bus stop.  Wonderful.  Thank you, sir. 
[02:55:00]  No surprise, though.  Let's go to Montreal.  I almost like the attitude of the city on that one, though.  Yeah.  I like the city's attitude.  He was punching her in the face.  Yeah, well, she probably got lippy.  We got places to be.  That's a pay-up, stupid.  Yo, Anthony, I hate to say this because I love the show, but you're kind of being an  ignorant fucker on this whole tax thing.  Ooh.  Hey, I'm just saying.  Okay.  There's currently a 60 cents a gallon gas tax in New York City.  And if you remember during the primaries, three of the candidates were like, we should  repeal this because people really need it. 
[02:55:30]  And actually, your best friend, Obama, was the only one who said no.  Wait, 60 cents for New York State?  New York State.  Or New York City.  What about the state tax?  All of New York is 59.6 cents, including all of the taxes put together on the gallon.  That's city, federal, everything.  Oh, really?  Every single thing.  I got it right in front of me if you want me to know.  Wow.  Okay.  Well, that isn't as much as I thought then, sir.  All right.  We have no problem being corrected. 
[02:56:00]  I thought it was a hell of a lot more.  I thought so, too.  All right.  And the plastic bag thing, too, you're just completely wrong about.  Why?  Why?  Well, think of it this way.  Even if you get 20 bags, it takes 20 bags for you to spend a dollar.  You say it doesn't work.  I live in Montreal.  I'm from Connecticut originally, but I live in Montreal.  Yeah.  People bring their own bags.  There's like a 90% thing where people will participate in this program, and five cents  is nothing at all.  Oh, stop.  It's just more taxes, though.  Everything's tax, tax, tax. 
[02:56:30]  We have enough to worry about without having to bring our own taxes.  Stop the taxes.  The supermarkets.  Stop.  You fucking traitor of this country, anyway.  Living in Montreal.  University is fucking one-third of a price in Canada.  See?  And you're getting one-third the education.  There you go.  Good luck to you, you moron.  40th grade.  Dope.  40th grade.  That's right.  That's good.  And try to find some good music on your radio station.  That's good.  That's good.  School is for queers.  I got a chem.  I don't need to.  There you go. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, good point.  Sorry.  Moose you.  Sorry.  What, are you studying to be a Mountie?  The Mounties do kind of fuck us up, and there are tons of racists up here.  I don't know if you guys heard about that.  No.  No, we haven't.  No, not at all.  All right.  Well, Jimmy, happy birthday.  Thank you, man.  I thought everybody forgot.  Punch it out.  Bye.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Can I tell you, I was listening on the YouTube to the Elephant Man bit we did.  Oh, yeah.  The Rocky Dennis bit.  Mm-hmm.  And we were laughing at when Cher brought the hooker home.  And we were talking, and Anthony said that Cher went to the hooker. 
[02:57:30]  Hey, how much to fuck a monster?  I fucking laughed all weekend about that.  How much to fuck a monster?  My brother's son.  It was like Rocky Dennis part one, part two, and it was a three-section assault on this dead,  deformed kid.  Yeah.  Oh, we are awful.  How much to fuck a monster?  I did the same fucking thing when we were doing the Elephant Man, ragging on the Elephant 
[02:58:00]  Man.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I was driving, listening to you going off about that with my kit, my kit, when he  got his little comb and his perfume that he dabbed behind his disgusting ears.  My kit.  My kit.  Hello, my friend.  My friend.  No one likes you.  You're disgusting.  Exactly.  We're just people who aren't hitting your head with a bat. 
[02:58:30]  Is that what you consider a friend?  Is anyone who's not braining him with a rake a fucking good buddy?  My friend.  You only spit on me.  I was listening to that just crying, man.  Those nice, easy targets.  Oh, he was a fucking jizz bag.  Deserved it.  I got to take a leak.  Do, do, do, do. 
[02:59:00]  Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  Wow.  Didn't go with the music there.  Oh.  I hate your guts.  How's that doing, Jimmy?  I had great sales at the Stress Factor this weekend.  Very good.  And I'll be in Staten Island this Wednesday at a Barnes & Noble, and I'll be at a Borders  Thursday in Rhode Island before I hit Boston.  I think it's actually, I think it's for Boston available on Friday's show and Saturday's  sold.  I want to, I can't wait to get back up there.  I'm thinking of going to, I'm thinking of going to the Wilbur's Theater this weekend. 
[02:59:30]  Are you really?  Yeah.  Really?  I haven't been to Boston in a while.  I might just jump on a choo-choo and go see Jimmy this weekend.  A choo-choo?  Choo-choo.  What's that doing?  It's up a little bit.  I'm 130.  I'm 140.  Yeah, we're up over 9,000 again.  It's all good.  Back into the 9,000.  We're fine.  Oh, are we?  No worries.  No worries.  That's because the Chinese decided to do a few shenanigans over there. 
[03:00:00]  What stimulates them?  I don't know.  They pass around videos of women in bridesmaids outfits being shit on.  Yeah, exactly.  There are creeps over there.  Bound feet.  I don't know what gets them off.  Well, you ever walk around Central Park and see the Asians in the wedding gowns?  We've talked about this.  No.  But they're not really getting married.  There's some kind of...  Someone has to answer that question for us.  You could go into Central Park right now.  You will see an Asian couple dressed as a bride and groom getting pictures taken every single fucking day. 
[03:00:30]  How do you know they're not married, though?  It's obvious.  The wedding gowns are a little dirty because they're...  I'm telling you.  Someone could help me out on this one.  I don't know if it's a big thing overseas and it's for wedding catalogs or something.  But every single time I'm in the park, you see at least one.  At least.  And it's always Asian.  If that was the fact, why wouldn't you have just bride and grooms of every race and nationality in the park?  Maybe it's a thing.  I'm telling you.  It's an ethnic thing they do. 
[03:01:00]  I need to know what that's about, though.  Are they doing it for the catalogs or what?  Fascinating.  Hey, I want to say hi to all my celebrity rehab fans out there.  Ah.  And I know Ant was saying that reality shows in general you hate.  I haven't even...  I can't deal with them anymore.  They're all from...  They're all the same mold.  And they had a trend for a while.  It was called...  Well, this is part of that.  Celeb reality.  Yeah.  And at first it was kind of cool, but now that's a joke.  I mean, Ozzy made that really cool, obviously. 
[03:01:30]  And now it's so watered down from what him and his family was doing.  But this celebrity rehab show, holy fuck.  It's good.  It's just...  It's good.  That Dr. Drew, we've got to get him on the show.  I can't take the calculated editing that they do and where they come up with a made-up conflict  and then they use cuts of the people making these long staring looks that you know had 
[03:02:00]  nothing to do with what was going on at the time.  But they look and they're staring at something and they look like they're pissed off.  And you assume they're looking at the person that they're mad at.  But they could just be staring at a wall.  It's like very calculated editing to make drama.  So it's not reality.  It's all the same thing.  They get people together.  There's conflict.  There's this.  There's the in-charge guy.  And I just hate the whole premise of reality shows. 
[03:02:30]  You know what happened, though?  When Real World hit, and the reason why it was so cool, A, because we never saw anything  like that before on TV, but B, they had patience.  The Real World houses, those people lived with each other for something like six to eight  months.  And they waited around and they filmed constantly in the basement or something.  And they knew if they had the cameras rolling the whole entire time, eventually they would  develop their own storylines relatively naturally.  I know they're still setting up things here and there. 
[03:03:00]  But then what happened was they didn't want to sit around anymore and have patience,  probably because it costs way too much money to have a crew on site 24 hours a day for  eight months or whatever it would be.  Now, like Real World, I watched one recently, maybe a couple seasons ago.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Whatever.  But it takes place now within a month, like a month and maybe five, six weeks.  That's it.  That's all they want.  And what they're doing is pushing, like Anne said, storylines instead of waiting for  it to happen naturally.  It's bad.  And that's what's fucking up that whole genre. 
[03:03:30]  And they're not even regular people.  They're all like, now they have to have this person and that person, you know, the  particular, you know, oh, the guy that thinks he's getting all the pussy, the whore drunk  chick, the gay guy, this guy.  It was more of a natural, real environment of people in the first probably two or three  real worlds.  After that, it just started.  Right.  You know, they were acting for the cameras and for the auditions and everything.  Yeah.  Because if you got hired to be on the real world, people are like, what?  What is this?  The first one, it wasn't. 
[03:04:00]  It was a far cry from the beautiful people being on there.  That's for sure.  So, but it was more of a reality show.  You know, you were getting real conversation and real shit out of these people.  Conflict and moments.  Yeah.  Now they just try to get models that'll be attractive to, you know, people that are popping  on MTV, make them get in a hot tub together and start making out.  And then one is yelling at the other one and the show's over.  Well, they booze them up too, big time.  Yeah.  They never used to do that.  They knew they would get something eventually by just kind of like letting the cameras roll. 
[03:04:30]  So, but, uh, but celeb, uh, the celeb, celebrity rehab, whatever it's called is amazing.  Gary Busey's in and he's, he thinks he's there for inspiration and they're trying to  tell him, no, you're here cause you have a drug or alcohol problem.  Yeah.  And he's like, no, I'm just here to kind of inspire you people.  And he didn't, he's trying to deny the fact that he's actually, you know, a patient.  I'm tired of Gary Busey on these shows too.  But they explained that, get it.  You're crazy.  Ooh, you're, you're a crazy person. 
[03:05:00]  But they explained that they, they took a big, huge chunk of his brain out.  Yeah.  Like the guy's not right.  Yeah.  He seems relatively right.  Like he's just on some pills and stuff.  But the fact remains, he has a big, huge chunk of his brain gone.  Yeah.  Good.  Good for him.  He could be the executive producer of our show.  And let's see even here last night, uh, last night they had a rocker dude on, you know,  this is the first peak last night that I saw.  It's been on a couple of weeks and, uh, guys talking about how he traveled the world. 
[03:05:30]  And I'm like, he's a rock musician, obviously.  And I'm trying to figure him out.  I'm looking at him close.  I'm like, who is this guy?  He's not, you know, he obviously was in a really, really popular band.  And finally, you know, I watched for 10 or 15 minutes.  It was revealed that it's, uh, Steve Adler from fucking Guns N' Roses.  I'm like, that's fucking, that's Steve Adler.  Just a mess.  What has, what he has become.  He has, he does this with his mouth and his eyes and stuff.  When he talks, he's like, coke grind, right?  Coke grind.  Well, supposedly he had a massive heroin problem. 
[03:06:00]  Supposedly he had, uh, seizures and strokes and the unrecognizable.  I would bet money that nine out of 10 people would go that, that Steve, you know, who is  that?  I don't know.  What did he play?  Uh, drums, right?  Steve Adler was the drummer in the original lineup.  Flea was in who?  Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Oh, there's so many fucking people in Guns N' Roses.  Yeah, he was, he was the original drummer.  Actually, I think if I know my, my, uh, my Guns N' Roses stuff, he was the one that actually  put an ad in with, I think, uh, Slash looking for a singer. 
[03:06:30]  And that's how they got Axl, I believe.  Am I right, Travis?  Sort of?  What'd you say?  Eh, whatever.  Yeah.  Huh?  What are you listening to?  I was, I was walking in.  Uh, no, yeah, he was one of the original members, and, uh, he's a mess.  You gotta see a picture of him.  It's amazing it's the same guy.  And he was the first one that was kicked out of the band.  Yeah.  Because of his, just massive, massive heroin addiction.  Yeah.  I don't know who that is.  What did he get kicked out of? 
[03:07:00]  Sorry?  Pretty early on.  I don't remember the name of the guy who replaced him.  Yeah.  Uh, Steve in Michigan, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Yeah, I heard you talking about that cigarette attack thing, and oh, man.  Uh, about two years ago, I go up to the mailbox, and there's a little letter from the Michigan  Treasury Department when I thought, what the fuck is this?  This can't be good, right?  No, that's never good.  I pop it open.  They subpoenaed some company in Kentucky that I was buying cigarettes from online. 
[03:07:30]  Well, they wanted their taxes.  Fucking scumbags.  Without a pack, Michigan charges for taxes.  Plus, they wanted sales tax.  Don't even fucking buy it here.  Ugh.  How much was they bill you for?  What's that?  How much was the bill for?  $1,200.  What fucking pieces of shit.  Did you pay it?  You know what?  They said, if you pay this by the end of the month, we're not going to charge you 100% penalty.  Yeah.  Did you pay it? 
[03:08:00]  Oh, yes, I paid it.  God, those fucking vultures.  Vultures.  They got you by the balls.  What are you going to do?  All right.  You can't do anything.  Yeah.  Goddamn cunt.  Governor from Canada.  Liberal bitch.  Whatever.  She raised the taxes up to $2 a pack.  Started doing that shit.  Yeah.  What do you do?  What do you do?  There's nothing you can do.  We decided to take all this a long time ago. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  Poopy Pants from PA.  Hey, are you guys getting kicked off DirecTV?  I guess we are.  I don't know.  A lot of phone calls and instant feedback coming in about that.  Can I tell you what that is?  If you're listening to us on DirecTV, they are doing it probably because it's exclusive  talk content.  So just get the service.  I mean, it's like, you know, you want to ride around with DirecTV in your fucking car?  We got a huge following.  We got a huge following on DirecTV.  So hopefully some of them will come this way. 
[03:09:00]  Hopefully, but they're not.  I mean, a percentage will.  You know.  And no one told us if it is happening.  Why would they tell us?  Why would we be in the loop?  If you're listening to us on DirecTV, how about this?  But I guess they're saying on DirecTV that the channel is going away.  Because I did get an email from one of the big bosses.  He's like, since...  Paula McCartney.  Basically saying it's not public knowledge, so how do the listeners know this?  They know everything.  It's because they know everything is my answer, because I'm not writing it back. 
[03:09:30]  Believe me, none of these things that you think are secret are secret.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Everyone knows about it before you announce it.  Right.  So.  Did that say Paul McCartney wants to serenade Michelle Obama?  Why?  What do you want to sing to her?  What?  Michelle, my bell.  Oh, Jimmy!  That's what I'm going to do when you have a good line now.  Jimmy!  I've got a whole show.  I'll be filled with Jimmy's.  You didn't say it right.  Do it. 
[03:10:00]  Is that true, Ant?  Yeah.  Yeah, they just showed up.  He cares what he wants.  Paul McCartney.  Big deal.  They're trying to make it special for him, man.  What?  He probably wants a girl who can fight for inauguration.  They're trying to do some special things.  There's going to be a big crowd down there in Washington.  So Paul McCartney serenades Barack's wife.  Who cares?  And they were trying to scalp the tickets to the inauguration.  On eBay, you can find tickets anywhere from like $1,200, $1,300, all the way up to hundreds  of thousands of dollars for tickets that haven't even been given out yet. 
[03:10:30]  They don't give them out until a couple of weeks before the inauguration.  And I don't think you know what ticket you're getting.  So I think a lot of people are getting scammed on eBay.  Go figure that one out.  You're going to be a half mile from the stage.  Hey, Jimmy, Dave from Massachusetts explains why DirecTV is important.  He writes, that sucks in huge letters.  I have XM, but I listen on DirecTV when I'm eating breakfast in the morning.  Not saying that it's not important. 
[03:11:00]  A lot of these people go, wow, I got the DirecTV in the house.  Nice.  I got it for the car.  I'm set.  I'm good.  That's true.  So you'll still get the show.  You'll miss a few minutes.  I'm talking to people who have just been listening to it on DirecTV without getting XM or now serious.  Just get it.  You're sick of the regular radio anyway.  It stinks.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Justin in Boston.  Justin.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Justin?  You're my idol.  Oh, thank you, Justin.  You're a good boy and perceptive. 
[03:11:30]  That wasn't a good line.  That was Justin.  Hey, I heard a funny story this morning getting ready for work.  Some guy, 25 years old, got caught exposing himself to a busload full of students.  At first, I thought that was kind of creepy.  Then it was announced that it was a high school cheerleading squad from a local Catholic high school.  Yeah, so what's the guy supposed to do?  That's a big deal.  I wouldn't say it's a funny story.  It's kind of hot.  I'm not going to.  It's very hot.  I'm not going to worry about that one.  I mean, it was a kindergarten bus or something then.  Right.  Hey, I was going to say Matt Sorum myself, but I thought there was a drummer between Stephen Adler and Matt Sorum. 
[03:12:00]  Matt Sorum from the cult, yes, but he officially replaced Stephen Adler.  I thought there might have been another guy in between those two because Matt Sorum is now the drummer of...  The other band.  This is where I'm strong.  Music.  That other band.  You kill me in movies.  Of Jimmy?  I think of...  He's the drummer of what current band? 
[03:12:30]  He plays for the...  Don't look how pal talk it.  Ooh.  Why are these guys cleaning these windows every fucking day?  I know who he plays for.  How much dirt are on these windows?  He plays for the Ted Sheckler Trio.  The Ted Sheckler Trio.  That's right.  What genre are they in?  They're like a barbershop quartet.  They sing a lot of old 50s.  Scooby-Dubby-Doo.  Or Scooby. 
[03:13:00]  I like Scooby, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Velvet Revolver.  You looked it up.  What?  I can't accept that answer.  I was sitting here like this.  No, I can't accept that answer.  Hands crossed.  You may believe you're looking out the window as you glance past PalTalk.  I looked out the window.  I curse your fans on PalTalk.  I curse them.  And I happened to see somebody on PalTalk type out Velvet Revolver.  I didn't even know what it meant.  I just blurted it out.  The beauty was you were really trying to look smooth.  I'm like, yeah.  I just got to look to my left, but I don't... 
[03:13:30]  All I got to know.  He can't see me looking to my left, so I'll make believe I'm looking out the window.  That's all I got to do.  I was found out.  Drats.  Yeah.  Well, Bill K. from Philly, hey, we're all not as rich as you, Jimmy.  That's how he writes it.  I can only afford the four radios I currently have, plus the XM for my BlackBerry.  Dude, I'm not saying that being rich.  I'm just saying that they're taking it away.  Yeah.  I mean, let's be business-wise.  A company that, like, well, people will pay for exclusive talk content. 
[03:14:00]  I'm only saying get the service.  It's not like we want it taken away, but we would rather keep you as listeners.  It's just more disturbing that we're not in the loop on these things that our listeners have to tell us.  That's all.  Yeah.  I'm not going to cause a scene, because, you know...  We're a show, dude.  We love to be heard by everyone.  I don't know what I do, so, you know, I understand.  I'll keep it professional, but we should be in the loop on some of these things.  Let us know before the listeners tell us.  We're so out of the loop.  We just want to know before the listeners.  That's not asking for much.  Yeah.  We don't want to get news from our listeners. 
[03:14:30]  Please.  Huh?  I don't even know the loop when I see it.  Jimmy!  That wasn't a good line.  That was more of a...  I'm trying to get my new bit off the ground.  Your head has to turn.  You don't say it straight.  You go, like, leaning to the right, and you kind of come up and go to the left.  I want my Jimmy to go from the right speaker all the way to the left by the end of the name.  Okay.  I think that'd be kind of cool.  Yeah.  Oh, it's called panning?  See, that's where you get me. 
[03:15:00]  Panning.  I only have music on you, I think.  I think that's basically all I got on you.  And barely.  Science.  Yeah, I got science on you.  Science!  Yeah.  Yeah, sure I do.  Science!  Sure I do.  Oh, nice.  A little plug for Jimmy.  Rick in Rockland.  Plug away.  Hi, boys.  Hi, Rick.  Before I tell Jimmy what I wanted to say, I can't get you guys on.  I can't get the 202 on the XM radio on the internet anymore.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, I guess they took that away, too.  And, Jimmy, the other point, I'm just throwing all this out there.  Porky York from Minnesota.  The Porky York, by the way.  Wow.  There's a few people trying to imitate him.  It's another format you're not on anymore.  Doesn't that bother you?  And that's where I'm coming from.  Sure.  Yay.  Of course.  We lose audience numbers, my friend.  As talent.  Yay.  And where we sit, we want numbers.  As the show, of course it bothers us.  But I do understand why they would do it.  I'm not saying I like it.  Mm-hmm.  But I do get it. 
[03:16:00]  What was Rick's plug?  Jimmy got another I miss mentioned this morning.  Oh, did I really?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was saying, I got these three crappy comedians, and, of course, Jim Norton's over  there with my buddies, O.P. and Anthony.  Oh, nice.  And I had a real quick question for Anthony, if you don't mind.  Yes, sir.  And you're such a big Back to the Future fan, and you like cars and stuff.  Why don't you just go buy a DeLorean?  What's wrong with you?  Well, I don't have enough garage space, is why I haven't bought any other car.  Parked in your driveway.  How cool is that?  No, I don't want a DeLorean parked in the driveway. 
[03:16:30]  Put it on top of your house.  Maybe I'll build a billboard, and I could park it behind the billboard.  The Lion Estates billboard.  The Lion Estates.  Yes.  You should have it haphazardly bouncing on the top of your house.  Yes.  With the wind blows, and it just slowly rotates, because you've got it just perfectly balanced.  By the way, very important day in Back to the Future History.  Yeah?  Yes.  Not really.  No?  I thought it was today.  Oh, no.  Wednesday is a very big day.  Wednesday is?  All right, let's look at Wednesday. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, so today is just part of the week where he's hanging out.  Yeah, he's just chilling right now at Doc's house.  He's just chilling at Doc's.  Like, they didn't really get into the time where he was just kind of chilling.  Yeah, because there are a few days, if you look at the chronology of this, that there's  days where Marty just had nothing to do.  Yeah.  And it was not documented in the documentary, Back to the Future.  Yes, the documentary called Back to the Future.  I'm sure there's lost footage of what Marty did on his off days.  Yeah, what did he do?  So, him and Doc are hanging out.  They can't really fuck anything up. 
[03:17:30]  So, would they sit there and not talk to each other?  Well, I guess they possibly do.  They had to go shopping for 50s clothes, right, for Marty.  Yeah.  So, I guess they probably went to the store.  They had to eat.  That would be a little risky, though.  The diner, that was a favorite spot of theirs.  Yeah, yeah.  They probably went to that diner for a bunch of meals.  The diner?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  All right, wait for Wednesday, then, for the big news?  Wednesday is just huge.  I can't wait.  Huge!  That should be wonderful.  Yeah, I can't wait.  Hey, a lot of people are saying they're listening online, so.  We don't know what's real and what's not, because no one really keeps us in the loop, 
[03:18:00]  is the point I'm trying to make today.  All right, listen, we were talking about parking and stuff, and people reminded us of Jimmy Justice.  We love Jimmy Justice, and we're going to do some Jimmy Justice audio in just a bit here.  Wonderful.  If you've never heard Jimmy Justice, stick around.  Jimmy Justice, we've got to get into this. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, he's the greatest.  We love Jimmy Justice, and we're learning that he's an old fan of the show.  He used to listen to WNEW, and his videos are all over YouTube, and God, we love this guy.  He is a douche, and I love him.  Yeah, we hate the meter maids.  We still call them meter maids.  Meter maids.  We hate the brownies, the traffic cops.  They're not real cops.  They're just there to make your life miserable.  They hang out by the parking meters and wait for it to go to, what's the word there? 
[03:19:00]  Zero.  Expired.  Expired.  And then they quickly write a ticket, even if they see you're running with a baby carriage.  They don't give anyone a break.  They're just a bunch of passes.  And on the fail meters, they write on your tire.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  That's the other thing that they write on your tire.  Oh, yeah.  That's the other thing they do.  So they can keep up with the time that you were there at a fail meter.  Yeah, they mark tires and everything.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They put a little chalk mark on your tire, and if it doesn't move.  You know, I had one of these jerks give me a ticket because I was riding my bike on a pier. 
[03:19:30]  I was probably riding my bike slower than people were walking, you know, just kind of on the bike and slowly kind of because I didn't want to get off my bike.  Yeah.  And she comes a run, and I told this whole story already in a golf cart and wrote me up, and I'm saying, look, I didn't know.  I didn't see the sign, and she was on a power trip because she's not a real cop.  Real cops don't, for the most part, aren't on power trips.  No, they won't screw with you like that.  But these nobodies, they get what they think is a little power, and they take advantage of it. 
[03:20:00]  And then the NYPD, unfortunately, they had to make them look like real cops because people were beating them up for being asses, right?  Yeah.  So now they look like they're part of the NYPD.  They technically are, but they don't have guns or they can't even arrest you.  They can't do nothing.  They have a car that says, NYPD.  Yeah.  Traffic.  Traffic.  It's a small traffic up by the doorknob just to make sure.  I will blast by them at 90 miles an hour. 
[03:20:30]  Like, I could care less.  I'll rob a bank in front of one of them.  Like Walmart security.  Yeah, that's what they are.  Yeah.  And they have the NYPD logo and everything because it makes them look important.  It's kind of like the Celtics.  You've got the guys that are wearing the Celtic gear that plays on the team, and then you've got the administrators.  But, you know, if you look quickly, you're like, wait, is he one of the Celtics?  They get a little confused, and that's what they want.  But this Jimmy Justice is putting these asses, these traffic cops in their place. 
[03:21:00]  I want to play the one from yesterday, then we're going to play a new one today, okay?  Just to bring Patrice aboard.  Listen to this guy.  He goes around New York City, Patrice, with a camera, and his whole thing is waiting for these traffic cops to F up.  And then he gets in their face.  Oh.  Listen to this.  You made an illegal U-turn in a business district.  Don't do that.  You made an illegal U-turn in a business district.  You don't do that.  And I have it on video.  Don't do that.  What kind of example are you for the citizens of New York?  You're a police officer.  You're not supposed to make a U-turn within a business district. 
[03:21:30]  Can you get out of my face?  You're not allowed to make a U-turn in a business district in the city of New York.  You violated the law.  You're supposed to.  You're supposed to.  Come on, arrest me.  Arrest me.  I don't have the authority to arrest you.  Why are you saying that?  But I have the authority to videotape you, call 3-1-1, and file a report against you.  Call him.  Call him.  I will.  Call him.  Call him.  Because I have it all on video.  Call him now.  You're supposed to enforce the law and not violate the law.  Get out of my face.  I'm going to get you arrested.  For what?  Because you videoed me, and I said don't do it.  I videoed you breaking the law.  I said don't video.  You're the one who broke the law and not me. 
[03:22:00]  Why are you mad at me?  The best part of that video, she goes, get out of my face or I'll get you arrested.  And she knows.  She can't.  If she called a real cop, they're going to be like, yeah, whatever.  I'll be there in four hours.  Yeah.  What do you need?  Right.  Because we've talked to the cops.  The ones that are honest, they'll tell you.  They don't like these.  They hear them on the radio, and they're like, oh, I got a problem.  There's somebody hassling me.  I'm trying to write them up.  And the real cops will be like, yeah, I'll be right there.  Yeah.  And they don't show up.  They don't care.  It's the people part. 
[03:22:30]  Like most concepts in life are pretty good.  What messes it up is people.  People.  You got to take the people out of the equation.  Communism isn't bad until the people.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, it works on paper.  It's just people who enjoy making your life miserable.  And like these traffic people, it's like you put yourself.  That's why I don't even beg anymore.  Like if something's going on, he's writing it.  I just start cursing them out talking about their African heritage because most of them 
[03:23:00]  are Africans.  African heritage?  What's your move?  Oh, that's funny.  Shouldn't you be somewhere dying in a diamond mine?  It's like somewhere.  Oh, God.  I really am awful to traffic cops, man, because I have no respect for them.  That $65 is worth the pain and suffering that they get.  Yeah.  It's worth it because she enjoys her job.  And I'm sorry.  Nope.  Uh-uh.  And here's the one I hate out of all of them.  Oh, yeah.  I started writing it already.  Already started writing it. 
[03:23:30]  What does that even mean?  Well, you know what?  A couple of times I've had them write down the wrong license plate.  Mm-hmm.  They wrote down the wrong number or a wrong letter.  Because you got them all flustered.  And they just, and the thing is done.  Yeah.  So they wrote down that somewhere there's $100 that's floating around that needs to be paid.  Yeah.  It works.  Well, this rant continues.  But you can see, excuse me.  Yeah.  Like, she not only likes her job, but it's this phony sense of empowerment she has. 
[03:24:00]  That's why a lot of times a cop will give you a break, but she won't because she has no  empowerment at all.  And this is a chance for her to get back.  And he picked the right one, too.  Oh, yeah.  Honey, chow.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Instead of just saying, you know what?  You're right.  I did make that turn.  That was kind of stupid.  That would have taken every bit of wind out of his sails if she would have said, yeah,  I screwed up.  That was kind of dumb.  Or she said, I'm allowed to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, or something.  Yeah.  I'm law enforcement.  I can do what I want.  Well, Jimmy Justice continues with this broad.  You want to call 1911? 
[03:24:30]  You want to call him?  You want to call him?  Let me see your badge number, please.  Yes.  I want your badge number.  Call him?  I want your badge number.  You made an illegal U-turn in New York City.  You're supposed to enforce the law, not violate the law.  You want me to call him?  Now you're going to drop in your radio.  You're a boob.  You want to call him?  You're a boob.  Do you want to call him?  A boob.  I will call them.  I want your badge number, and I will file a 3-1-1 report against you.  You forgot something.  Hello?  You forgot something.  That's my case.  Yeah.  That's my case.  Okay?  Don't make illegal U-turns in New York City. 
[03:25:00]  I asked you to step out my face.  I asked you to step out my face.  I asked you not to make illegal U-turns in New York City within a business district.  I am Jimmy Justice, and your days of running around this city like a cowboy are over.  How great is he?  How great is he?  He's got a bit of humor.  What's the song at the end he's singing?  I don't know.  We'll have to.  What is it, Iraq?  Oh, God bless Jimmy Justice.  He's the greatest.  I'm Jimmy Justice.  I would hate him if he was coming after me, but you've got to love him.  If we talk to him, I want to know something or a series of events, but I guarantee you there was one thing that snapped him, 
[03:25:30]  and he's like, they are all going to suffer.  There was one phony sense of empowerment moment that one of these pigs wouldn't give him a break.  You don't feel like that, though?  Always, yes.  I feel like that about the TSA, where I just want to do something just to stop them.  Yeah.  It's so frustrating.  I used to live in a brownstone, and I would go away for the weekend, and I would have to pull up in front of my brownstone,  double park, and quickly get my stuff out of the car, come back, and then I would go find a parking space, 
[03:26:00]  and put my parking lights on and all that, right?  And I swear, one time I got a ticket, I was inside for less than a minute, and I come out, and there was a ticket,  and they were long gone.  They're not even around where you could dispute it.  I'm like, it's obvious that I'm just unloading luggage from the weekend.  It's even on a Sunday, so they're not stupid.  They know what people are doing on a Sunday.  And they don't get him back into town.  And it's like the devil's advocate, where they just all kind of blend in after.  Like, he disappears.  They do disappear. 
[03:26:30]  It's like, hey, did you give me a ticket?  He's like, no.  So a lot of people heard that Jimmy Justice yesterday.  We're going to play a brand new one today, and I think we're going to get him on the show today, hopefully.  So here's more Jimmy Justice.  These videos are linked on onaradio.com.  We have another one?  Yeah, traffic cop blocks a hydrant during a fire.  Wow.  And Jimmy Justice was on the scene.  Thank God.  Here we go.  I love him.  Are you on drugs?  What is your problem?  You're a traffic enforcement agent, and you parked your official vehicle blocking a fire pump, 
[03:27:00]  and there's a fire outside with firemen out there, and they have no access to the pump.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  While you're in the store, you don't hear the sirens.  What's the matter with you?  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  You're supposed to enforce the law, not break the law.  What's the matter with you? 
[03:27:30]  Oh, is he just a bastard.  Well, you know what's great about this, too?  He knows there's nothing they could do to him.  Yeah.  There's nothing.  He's not cursing or threatening them.  Look, you do this to an NYPD cop.  Oh, boy, you're going downtown for a while.  They'll figure something out.  Oh, they'll write you up for something.  And they'll make your life a living hell for a few hours, even if they don't have an official charge.  But with these things...  Cops have a little loophole.  Oh, of course.  That clarkers everything called disorderly. 
[03:28:00]  Of course.  Right.  Where they tell you to do something, and you do it.  Turn the camera off, you don't do it.  Disorderly conduct.  Disorderly conduct.  That's that loophole.  And it doesn't matter if it gets thrown out or something.  It's just going to be a pain in your ass to have to be run through all the hoops.  If a cop tells you to do something, you don't do it.  It's a crime.  Right.  Yeah.  Disorderly.  Which makes your rights gone.  Every right is gone.  It destroys your rights.  Do that. 
[03:28:30]  No.  Disorderly.  Disorderly.  Turn that camera off.  Nope.  Nope.  Disorderly.  Tased first.  Yep.  Dude, bro.  Bro.  Hey, okay.  I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.  Was it the same lady?  They all sound the same.  Yeah, they do.  I've got to be honest.  They all sound the same.  They all look and sound like they should be on a Sherry Springer show.  Fighting.  Looking for paternity or something.  And what bothers you is that with bill collectors sometimes or people that's just trying to help  you, like when they say the word can't, that's what gets sorry. 
[03:29:00]  Sorry now means nothing.  And the word, are you, you, you not, are you can't stop this or you won't?  Yeah.  Is, just tell me you won't so I can feel better about how much I hate you.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, don't write this ticket.  I can't.  I just.  I can't just stop.  I can't or you just will not stop.  Right.  Okay, I will not stop.  Fair enough.  There you go.  You're a piece of garbage.  It's like white people voting for Obama.  Just say you didn't vote for him because he's black.  Just make me feel good once. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, let's do another clip from Jimmy Justice.  Another traffic.  See, the reason I keep saying cop is because it's written that way.  Another traffic agent.  Agent.  Blocks a hydrant.  All right, Kizzy, hit it.  Jimmy Justice.  Is something wrong with blocking a fire hydrant?  Don't you think there's something wrong about filming somebody?  No.  No, I think you're a police officer who's supposed to enforce the law, but you violated  the law by parking your official police car blocking a fire pump.  Somebody else will get a ticket for that.  What's wrong with you? 
[03:30:00]  What's wrong with you?  T.  D.  U.  L.  A.  Carl, what are you doing?  Move away from the vehicle.  I'm filming you breaking the law.  Ms. Dula, you broke the law.  Yes, thank you, sir.  You broke the law.  Thank you.  What are you going to do, bite me with your gold tooth?  Oh, no.  No, he didn't.  You could just do that. 
[03:30:30]  You could.  You just broke the law.  You have all right to do it, okay?  I'm going to do that.  Thank you.  And I have it on video.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  You made my day.  You made mine, sir.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Wow.  I'll say this.  She collected her.  She was fairly as calm as you could be with somebody filming you.  Yeah.  She was all right.  Yeah.  All three of them are being big, fat women, though.  All three of these people.  Yeah, what is that?  Because then they can't pass any physical tests.  No.  They just sit there.  They get these orcas to just sit in the car and write. 
[03:31:00]  They're fat.  They get to sit there and just write.  They don't have to do anything.  They're all big, fat broads.  I'm sure they're also looking for someone that's going to be a bit intimidating looking.  Yeah.  They're not going to get a little cute little white thing that's anorexic.  Yeah.  No.  Why is that a large majority of the traffic enforcement agents are African-American?  I don't know.  Why is that?  Put them at risk.  Is that what it is? 
[03:31:30]  It's a put them at risk, cannon fodder kind of a thing?  Nobody cares about Africans.  Not even black people.  Yeah.  So just put them out there on the lines and let people yell at them and throw stuff at  them.  Yeah.  Okay.  What's up with the chopped meat hairdo, by the way?  Chopped meat.  It's awful.  Oh, my God.  Don't look at me.  Don't look at me.  Holy Jesus.  That's perfect.  To defend African hair.  What is a mess?  It's a new look they're doing.  Chopped meat hairdo. 
[03:32:00]  It looks like Sharpie dots.  It's...  You go to the supermarket, you see that chopped meat, 90% lean or something.  It looks like ground beef.  It looks like they're taking up a package of that and just going...  On the top of their head.  ...smashing it on top of their head.  Ground beef.  Will not...  Ground beef.  Let's call it the ground beef slash chopped meat.  Perfect.  Hairdo.  That's one thing I'll give white people credit for.  To introduce products.  I'm taking a picture of you because you're a police officer who's supposed to enforce the law.  And no parking?  And you parked your police car in a place where the sign says no parking anytime. 
[03:32:30]  I'm so blessed with you.  And you're not doing your job.  I'm taking a picture of you.  You went into the Rite Aid.  I can go into the Rite Aid.  Because if you don't know if I have a feminine problem...  Right.  ...you don't know if I have any type of problem...  Right.  ...you don't know if I have my asthma, if I need my medicine...  Right.  ...or anything like that.  You don't know my business.  Right.  So if you have to go...  But no, it's funny.  That's the excuses people use.  Yeah, exactly.  Look, my kid is having an asthma attack and I need to get something.  So I understand.  I don't care. 
[03:33:00]  I don't care.  Right.  Absolutely.  That's why this bit's so good.  I started writing.  I already started writing.  That's why this bit is brilliant.  Yeah.  Dismissive movement.  Yeah.  God bless Jimmy Justice.  Right.  ...or anything like that.  You don't know my business.  Right.  So if you have to go in the right aid...  So if I went in there and I have my period...  Right.  ...I can go in there.  Right.  And you don't have to park properly.  You're allowed to park...  I am parked properly.  But if the sign says no parking anytime...  A handicapped person can park in a no parking.  It says no parking anytime...  I'm handicapped.  Are you handicapped?  How do you know that?  I could be handicapped.  If you're handicapped, are you efficient at doing your job? 
[03:33:30]  Because he's in that tape in me.  I'm having a problem with racist Jimmy Justice, though.  Why?  Why can he find somebody other than this woman?  Probably not.  It seems to be...  It's the same woman, but it's different, but it's the same exact woman.  No.  But that's everyone that I've encountered, too.  Patrice, I've been this woman.  I've seen some wormy white boys, too, now.  Come on.  Not breaking the law.  Patrice.  Fair enough.  Honestly, I can't remember the last time I saw a traffic agent that was white.  I'm just being honest with my... 
[03:34:00]  Just my dumb life.  But it's the same woman.  I don't see him.  I don't see him.  I see a lot of big, black, fat women with the chopped meat hair.  Who's the guy jumping in here?  We missed this.  Yeah, we're getting there.  Okay.  Here we go.  The shame is that somebody else would get a ticket for that.  Well, my phone would get a ticket, though.  If any regular person parks where it says no parking any time, they'd get a ticket.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  And you know what?  I'm a supervisor.  She's in a marked vehicle. 
[03:34:30]  A marked vehicle is permitted to park here.  She's not in the bus stop.  She's not nowhere.  She's in a no parking.  Not for official business.  If anyone else could park here, so she can.  Right, but even if she's going into the store.  You park a regular passenger vehicle?  Yes.  You park that vehicle here?  Yes, she will get a summon, sir.  No problem, sir.  She's doing her job.  What's she supposed to do?  The vehicle is legally parked, sir.  The vehicle is legally parked, even though it says no parking any time.  Sir, is she a passenger?  I'm Jimmy Justice.  I'm Jimmy Justice. 
[03:35:00]  With that, let's say hi to Jimmy Justice.  Jimmy.  Hey, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How are you, buddy?  Well, I've been better, if it were years ago when you guys were on in the afternoon.  I had to wake up really early in the morning, but other than that, I'm doing great, and  it's an honor to talk to you guys.  Ooh, Jimmy Justice is lazy.  He doesn't like getting up.  Jimmy Justice has a drinking problem.  You know, Jimmy Justice is not lazy, but he works until late at night, and I usually  don't wake up this early.  How many videos do you have?  We love these things. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, we're obsessed with you, Jimmy.  I have on my computer probably about 20 or 30 hours of these confrontational videos.  Wow.  Now, what exactly, we've all dealt with these awful, disgusting people.  What incidents sparked you to just go on the rampage with a video camera?  The incident that sparked me to go on this rampage is about two years ago when I witnessed  a traffic enforcement agent write a civilian, a parking summons, for blocking a fire hydrant. 
[03:36:00]  And then the same traffic enforcement agent got into his official vehicle, he made a U-turn  and parked blocking a different fire hydrant on the other side of the street, and then  went into a restaurant to eat lunch.  And I said, there's got to be something wrong with that.  Yep.  So you kept your video camera on you at all times, and have any results happened because  of this stuff?  Like, what do you do with this stuff?  Do you dial 3-1-1, or what has happened because of this?  Oh yeah, very often I do dial 3-1-1, and it's not enough to just dial it and file a complaint. 
[03:36:30]  You have to keep following up on that.  Otherwise, they're not going to do anything about it.  And I've definitely seen a reduction in the rate of recidivism in areas that I have frequented  with my video camera.  And since the major media have also picked up on this, recently the mayor and the police  commissioner have directed the Internal Affairs Division of the Police Department to write  summonses and tow the vehicles of city workers and police officers who are illegally parked. 
[03:37:00]  See, to me, a regular cop in a marked squad car is different because they're just cops.  But I mean, you treat these people the way they should be treated, which is like they're  not like cops.  No.  They want to be able to do what they want to do and still write a ticket for the same  thing.  We just listen to the woman who had her period.  It all pointed out the same excuse that any other person would give she gave, and you  just had a video camera on her.  It's great.  And the reason they would write you up for being in front of a fire hydrant is because they 
[03:37:30]  want to keep the fire hydrant clear in case there's a fire.  So then they park there?  How does that make sense?  It doesn't matter what's parked there.  Right.  You're not supposed to park there.  Right.  It doesn't make any sense.  And guys, I've always said that some of the laws don't make any sense, but some make a  lot of sense.  And the laws of not blocking a fire hydrant are, it's not rocket science.  Right.  You don't do that because in case there's a fire, you need the firemen to get in there  and be able to do their job quickly.  So what's the difference if it's my vehicle blocking a fire hydrant or if it's a 
[03:38:00]  vehicle of a traffic enforcement agent who's in the McDonald's two blocks away, there is  absolutely no difference.  You should not block a fire hydrant.  What, have you had any bad incidents or no?  Have I had what?  Any bad incidents with these traffic people like, you know, where they get physical or  anything?  Oh, absolutely.  I've had a lot of physical altercations besides being yelled at and cursed at, which is perfectly  okay because that's what I do to them. 
[03:38:30]  I've been spit at.  I've been pushed.  I've been threatened with arrest.  I've been followed.  Have you gotten anybody fired?  Hopefully.  Well, interesting enough, if you saw the video I put on YouTube called Ms. Anderson Breaks  the Law, and that's the woman who gave me the middle finger and while a retired policewoman  came over and told me I'm not allowed to videotape anyone employed by the police department  because of terrorism. 
[03:39:00]  Well, that sergeant from the Traffic Enforcement Agency, her name was Edith Anderson, and actually  a few months after this video, she was arrested with two of her sons for selling crack out  of her apartment.  And this can be verified if you look up Edith Anderson on the New York Post police blotter.  And this incident happened a few months ago, so I'm not making it up.  So, Jimmy, what is the law like?  Like, when the one guy said, we just watched one where she parked to run into a Rite Aid 
[03:39:30]  or whatever, and the guy came over and said, well, it's an official vehicle.  Now, are there any times where they are allowed to be doing that, or are they pretty much always  lying when making excuses for themselves?  Okay, there are times because there is an exception written into the law that sanitation  enforcement agents and traffic enforcement agents are allowed to double park or do other  minor violations with their vehicles while they're doing their job.  And that does make a little bit of sense, even though it's not fair, but if they have 
[03:40:00]  to go into a highly congested area to write summits to others who are blocking the roadways  and causing a hazard, you know, sometimes they have to be there for a minute or two while  they're writing their summits.  So, that loophole is written into the law, and they're allowed to do that, but not when  they're running their personal errands.  And they shouldn't even be running their personal errands while they're at work.  They're doing two things wrong.  So, basically, like, if they park in a no-parking-anytime zone, they're standing out there writing a  couple of tickets, they're allowed to do that, but they're not allowed to block a hydrant 
[03:40:30]  because that's not a minor infraction.  Exactly.  They're never allowed to be in a bus stop, and they're never allowed to block a hydrant,  but they can be in a no-parking or a no-standing with a time signature, like if it says no-standing  from 3 to 6, for example.  Sure.  Looks like you studied this stuff, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  I do know my stuff, and I know the bounds of what I can and cannot do.  Have you seen or actually confronted any other traffic agents besides just fat African-American 
[03:41:00]  women?  Yeah, you know, my opponents have accused me of being a racist because...  Well, someone in studio just said that.  Well, I mean, I only saw four videos, and they were all the same giant African woman.  With the chopped meat hair.  I want to keep saying that.  She should have baskets on her head.  Yeah, that's not my fault, though.  What you see in my videos is just a microcosm of the demographic, and the fact is that most  traffic enforcement agents are black women with big tushies. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, fair enough.  Big tushies.  Just put up something else.  I don't know.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  Big tushies.  What other races have you encountered?  A little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  What other ethnic group have you encountered on your journeys?  Well, I have to tell you that the videos that I put on YouTube were some of my more colorful  clips.  Right.  I did want to create a little bit of a buzz, and obviously I put my best foot forward 
[03:42:00]  and put some of my better clips on there, and the most colorful exchanges I've had were  with black women.  That's just a coincidence, I think.  What's your favorite one that we could play?  Because we don't want to go through 30 hours at Jimmy Justice.  Oh, yes, we do.  We're lazy.  Well, one of the better exchanges were, you could play a little bit of the one called  Traffic Enforcement Agent Makes Illegal U-Turn.  Okay.  Oh, we did.  We did that one.  Is that what you said?  She was a boob?  Yeah, that's the one who I called a boob.  Yeah, we saw that. 
[03:42:30]  We love that one.  Well, Tim.  Or the best clip that I've ever had is a traffic enforcement agent who went into a  restaurant to stand in line and order her lunch.  She blocked a fire hydrant, and while she was waiting in line, a fire actually broke out  across the street.  We heard that one, too.  Well, you gave her the business.  Yeah, we picked the good ones, then.  Yeah, I read her the riot act.  Yeah, absolutely.  The riot act.  What do you do for work, Jimmy?  I'm an audio systems engineer, and I also play guitar in bands.  All right, so this is just kind of something you do for fun. 
[03:43:00]  You don't even make money off it, or do you sell DVDs?  I make a little bit here and there when I license some of my footage to television networks.  Also, people have gone on my YouTube page, and there's a link to my blog page, and people  hit a donate button and donate money to me through PayPal, so I've made a little bit  of money.  Not a lot.  It's really funny what you do, man, and just the fact that they're so belligerent.  Instead of just, have any of them went, you know what, you're right, and it was kind  of stupid that I just did that, and just acknowledged it, like really taking the wind 
[03:43:30]  out of your sails by kind of going, for lack of another old lady way of talking, has anyone  ever just said, ah, you know what, that was kind of stupid?  Fracial endeavor.  Actually, that's never happened.  Really?  Okay.  They're always, you know, some of them are not so belligerent.  They see me coming with a camera, and they're completely quiet.  They just get in their car and drive away.  But for someone to actually admit that they were wrong, that has never happened.  God, that's great.  I hate them.  The more I watch your videos, the more I hate their guts.  So please just keep, until we have a few traffic agent suicides, I'd like you to keep going. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, Jimmy, right on, man.  Thanks for calling the show today.  Bye. </pre>
