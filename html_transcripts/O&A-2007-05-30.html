<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion on a purported method for eliciting breast flashing from women using homemade signs.  This transitioned into a lengthy, rambling discussion about the New York Yankees' poor performance compared to the New York Mets, filled with inappropriate and offensive commentary about various baseball players.  A significant portion focused on a New York Post article detailing Alex Rodriguez's late-night activities in Toronto, including a strip club visit, with the hosts engaging in vulgar speculation about his actions and his wife's reaction.  The show then featured voicemails left for an unnamed Boston athlete, revealing numerous calls from women arranging encounters and angry messages from those who were stood up. More baseball-related banter and jokes about player names followed.

A news story about a man with highly contagious tuberculosis who ignored quarantine orders to travel internationally was discussed, along with commentary on his actions and potential consequences.  Other news items briefly mentioned included a video of a woman failing a stage dive, Miss USA being booed in Mexico, and a traffic reporter's revealing clothing, leading to further discussion about workplace appropriateness of cleavage, using vulgar descriptions and opinions.  The show mentioned upcoming guests Jimmy Fallon and Big A.  No in-studio guests were explicitly mentioned in this segment, however this section ended by mentioning them.

The next segment began with a discussion on the awkwardness of introducing a girlfriend with large breasts to one's family. This segued into a conversation about age-appropriate cleavage, with exaggerated and vulgar descriptions of older women. A caller mentioned a Telemundo weather broadcaster known for her prominent cleavage.  A "Mystery Sound" segment followed, with increasingly absurd caller guesses.  A new female intern, Renee, was introduced and subjected to a humorous, somewhat uncomfortable interview, including probing questions about her opinions of the show's staff.  This was followed by a bizarre "uncomfortably close interview" segment with Big A, strapped into bicycle helmets face-to-face, creating technical difficulties and humorous situations. Jimmy Norton's upcoming HBO special was mentioned, and Jimmy Fallon made a brief in-studio appearance. The segment was filled with crude humor, sexually suggestive comments, and offensive language.

The final segment focused on the difficulties of morning radio, with complaints about guest demands and pressure to create sexually suggestive content.  Jim Norton was in studio and shared his experiences with morning radio, contrasting it with his stand-up routine.  The bizarre "uncomfortably close interview" between a female interviewer and Big A, tied together with ropes and bicycle helmets, continued, filled with awkwardness and inappropriate jokes about Big A's hygiene.  Jimmy Fallon appeared as a guest, initially praised before being harshly criticized for one of his movies.  His appearance was interwoven with the ongoing "uncomfortably close interview" bit and the show's chaotic nature.  A caller named Steve from Bayshore added to the bizarre and sexually suggestive tone with an incomprehensible phrase ("harvest my face berries").  The segment concluded with Fallon discussing his song "Car Wash for Peace" for Fisher House, and the repeated playing of the song.  The hosts consistently used offensive language and made numerous sexually explicit jokes and references throughout this entire segment.

If they see the wow sticker or the homemade wow sign or the wow written in the dirt, there are ladies out there that will flash you. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  And you take a peek and just go about your life.  Yeah.  Don't harass the ladies.  People enjoy seeing that on the commute home.  For the most part, they do not want to have sex with you.  No.  It's just a quick little thing.  It makes them happy, makes you happy.  Then you go to your miserable jobs.  It's a little, you know, tee-hee-hee thing.  Right.  Where they're like, ooh, I'm being a little dirty today.  I'm being a little naughty.  And the guy's like, ooh, that's a nice little sight. 
[00:06:30]  And speaking of being a little dirty and a little naughty.  A little naughty.  I want to say good morning to all the Yankee fans.  Wait a minute.  What are you talking about the Yankees for?  What are you talking about our city?  What's wrong with you?  Why don't you talk about the Kansas City Royals for once?  Oh, my God.  You got to push always the Yankees.  The Kansas City Royals. 
[00:07:00]  Why not talk about the Royals?  Come on.  Talk about Gil Mesh.  Who the hell is Gil Mesh?  He's a royal.  See, you don't know.  Is he greater than Quisenberry from the old days?  Of course not.  Remember, Quisenberry is arguably the best royal ever.  You know what?  Sure.  Why not?  You win that one.  Because you know what?  I could even come up with another royal in their illustrious history. 
[00:07:30]  I don't think I can name one more royal.  Dude, Mark Tehan, what's the matter with you?  You can name another royal?  Oh, my God.  George.  Oh, George.  Scott.  Jetson.  George Brett.  George Jetson.  You know George Scott and George Jetson, George Brett.  There was a monster freaking home run hitter.  Yeah, Brett.  No, a black dude.  George Jefferson?  George Jetson. 
[00:08:00]  He never played for the Royals.  He did their cleaning.  Oh, screw the Royals.  The dry cleaning, of course.  I see.  He was moving on up.  George what?  George Foster?  No, man.  He was the Reds.  Reds, and he played for the Mets.  What the heck was his name?  Eh.  Eh.  I think my brother's baseball mitt was signed by this guy.  My dad.  Hal McRae?  Oh, Hal McRae.  There's a famous royal from the old days. 
[00:08:30]  My dad would get us the Mets that were signed by, like, losers.  Everyone else had, like, Hank Aaron's signed baseball glove.  Oh, we had names I'd never even heard of on our freaking gloves.  Why are you talking about the Royals?  Talk about the Yankees.  The Yankees.  Bo Jackson.  Thank you, fan.  Oh, wow.  Bo.  He's not the greatest royal.  But arguably the most famous that we couldn't remember.  Right.  Sure.  Anyway, we say good morning to all the Yankee fans. 
[00:09:00]  I would listen up if I was Boston.  I also say good morning to everyone listening on WBCN in Boston.  Oh, my God.  Boston just killing.  Boston, the Red Sox best team in baseball.  Best team in baseball.  Oh, George Steinbrenner's going to be crying again.  Second best team in baseball, my New York Metropolitan.  The Mets looking very good.  With a great win yesterday in the 12th inning.  Yeah.  And let's see where the Yankees are. 
[00:09:30]  Hmm.  And A-Rod.  Got to be up there somewhere.  Well, that's where we're getting at there, Jimmy.  Don't turn that dial.  Got to be up there.  The Yankees, right?  They're a great team.  That's a lot of money spent on the team.  Yeah.  They're up there every year.  Well, they're 14 and a half games back.  Oh.  And.  But good news.  Roger Clemens has one more warm up with, I don't know, the Wichita Mudhens.  And he'll be joining the team because that'll help.  Right about now, Roger Clemens is like, the only reason I came back, I thought we had a 
[00:10:00]  chance of winning it all.  And now I got to play for an awful team instead of playing golf.  He's going to be miserable in those pinstripes.  He's watching the team that he has to go back to just self-destruct.  Yeah.  Yankees tied for last place with Tampa Bay.  14 and a half games out.  Isn't that wonderful?  Oh, by the way, I'm proud of my Metropolitans.  The Metropolitans.  For booing.  For booing.  Barry. 
[00:10:30]  Barry Bonds there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Mets booed him?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, dude, the montage on the local.  Sorry, we're going local again.  I'm really sorry.  Why are you talking about the Metropolitans?  I apologize to Syracuse.  I've never even heard of them.  I apologize to Syracuse and Providence for going local.  But the montage this morning of Barry Bonds being booed at Shea Stadium yesterday, hilarious  to signs.  Yeah.  Somebody just said it's steroid night at Shea. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Someone found a blow-up, like, needle.  Yeah, a big blow-up needle.  Where do you get that?  Yeah, where do you get that?  I don't think you get that at the party shop.  Did some signs say baroids?  Baroid.  Baroid Bonds.  It's like, it doesn't even make sense.  That sign was stupid, whoever you are.  No, I liked it, though.  They were trying.  It was stupid.  There were so many signs that Shea just beat the crap out of him, and then they booed him  when he came up to bat for one. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, he was just pinch hitting.  Yeah.  Anyway, we say hi to the Yankee fans today because the front page of the New York Post,  God bless him.  A lot of times we trash the Post.  Yes, of course.  But there is good old A-Rod in a photo exclusive.  The rest of the papers will have this tomorrow.  The headline reads, Stray Rod.  Alex hits strip club with Mystery Blonde the night before the Yankees lost to the Blue Jays 
[00:12:00]  7-2.  The night before, he was out eating steak with his Mystery Blonde, and then he went to a  strip club with his Mystery Blonde, and then he went back to another hotel at around  midnight, midnight before the Yankees lost 7-2.  Yes.  Because, you know, the team's taking it very seriously right now.  Well, if you hit the strip club, that's bad enough, but you can almost say, all right,  he's going to the strip club.  This blonde could be anybody.  Who knows?  But the little blurb here says, as the last place Yankees continue their slide, superstar 
[00:12:30]  Alex Rodriguez and a bombshell blonde head into an elevator at the Swank Four Seasons Hotel  in Toronto Sunday after a night on the town, including a late night visit to a strip club.  Yeah, we're disagreeing with the bombshell blonde description.  Oh.  Someone in the office said that her biceps area is a little big.  She's got big arms.  A little big.  If you're going to cheat on your wife, well, we don't know if he cheated on his wife. 
[00:13:00]  Let's be...  But if you're going to.  If you're going to.  I don't know.  I think A-Rod could do even better than this.  Oh, his wife's got to be pissed.  And then...  Well, they can't even get out of it because they have an hour-by-hour breakdown.  Oh, they absolutely do.  I'm thinking maybe he could just say, hey, if we happen to walk in at the same time, no  good.  No, here's what you did at 9-0-3.  Yeah, because he could probably explain something to the wife.  Like, look, man, you know, she was drunk.  She's actually friends with blah, blah. 
[00:13:30]  You know, I was doing the gentleman thing.  And, look, obviously, I wouldn't be photographed with her if there was some hanky-panky going  on.  I love that.  Cynthia Rodriguez, A-Rod's wife and mother of their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter,  was nowhere to be seen during the Sluggers' big night out on the town.  Ah, the night before the Yankees lost 7-2.  Yep.  Well, the way they put it, it's...  Pathetic loss, they're calling it.  Yeah, the last place Bronx Bombers, pathetic 7-2.  Pathetic.  My Met fan. 
[00:14:00]  Well, it doesn't help team morale when your star player is out really late the night before  you're playing baseball.  But here's the funniest part of the whole article.  Okay.  Well, this is a different version, unfortunately.  And it came as Rodriguez took a room at Toronto's Four Seasons Hotel down the street from the  Park Hyatt, where most, if not all of his Yankee teammates and coaches are staying during  a three-game stint that ends tonight. 
[00:14:30]  I would assume he's staying at the same hotel as the rest of the Yankees.  And I'm thinking he may have gotten another hotel room in Toronto down the street just  to kind of get away from everybody.  So what's the hour-to-hour breakdown there, Jimmy?  Oh, I love the fact that you might be able to get out of it if it was just one photo.  But it said the powerhouse third baseman then flew to Toronto where he checked into the  Four Seasons.  Okay.  After settling in, the 31-year-old A-Rod, the mystery blonde, and two men left the Four 
[00:15:00]  Seasons in a taxi shortly after 8.30 p.m. and headed to dinner at the Harbor City Steakhouse.  And then they have, obviously, they describe his outfit.  And then it says, a witness told the Post that Rodriguez and his three companions spent  two hours dining.  That Rodriguez and possibly two other men and the blonde were driven in one of the Harbor's  cars to the Brass Rail, a flashy strip club, and they walked in just after 11 p.m.  They have an hour-by-hour breakdown of what this idiot was doing.  So 11 p.m. before they're about, you know, they're going to be playing the Blue Jays. 
[00:15:30]  He's still out rocking and rolling.  There's your star player taking it very seriously, being in the last place.  Rodriguez and the blonde spent an hour or so at the Brass Rail, the witness says.  When they walked out of there, A-Rod and the woman were alone.  So they then got a cab back to the Four Seasons.  The cab pulled up to the hotel minutes after midnight.  Oh, my God.  A-Rod then strode into the hotel behind her.  He rubbed his nose as if to obscure his face to other people as he joined her at the elevator 
[00:16:00]  bank.  As the doors to the elevator opened, he and the blonde got in together, the witness said.  The doors closed and they disappeared upstairs.  Well, I think he probably did the responsible thing and went right to bed, right?  I'm sure he did.  It's kind of late already there.  Making sure that young lady got home safely.  That's right.  This is a photo montage.  After a quick f*** job. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, my God.  This is awful.  I really feel bad for this dope.  He looks, if you know anything about body language, man, this is my opinion.  He is so guilty on the front page of the post.  The head down, the scratching the nose.  His hand is up kind of near his face like he's making believe he has to do something  on his face.  Don't look at me.  I'm not A-Rod.  I'm not going to.  I'm not about to have sex with this blonde woman.  He looks like me walking into my building with a tranny.  You think the perf switch just went off? 
[00:17:00]  We talk about the perf switch on the show.  Yeah.  And you got to think that even with the photographers following him, he's like, I can't help myself.  He could, you know, he could be going, ah, maybe, you know, you just go to your room.  I'm going to go back out.  I'm leaving.  Because if we're seen, it's really going to screw me.  But he was just like, oh, geez, I got to have some of that.  But maybe.  All right.  Maybe she's playing some ball finally.  Maybe.  We're all just guessing here, right?  And maybe they got a thing. 
[00:17:30]  Maybe he's his Toronto babe.  That's the Toronto babe.  I mean, we talk about the story from the old days.  We don't mention the player anymore.  But somebody gave us the voicemail of a very, very famous Boston athlete.  Yeah.  And we got to check his voicemails.  And that's all we did instead of show prepping is we spent an hour seeing who called overnight.  We were so excited by having this.  It was all women from different cities calling up with the schedule. 
[00:18:00]  Like, I know you're going to be in town, you know, next week.  Give me a call.  I'm hoping we can get together.  And all women just calling this guy.  All women.  Was it Jim Rice?  Jim Rice.  How old do you think we are?  Jim Rice.  Was it Carly Strzymski?  Carly Strzymski.  Jim Rice.  And it was some women that knew what the deal was.  It was going to be pretty much a one-nighter. 
[00:18:30]  And then other women that were stupid enough to think that actually this guy was going to, like, you know, marry them.  Yeah, kind of giving them crap.  And then we would get the phone calls from women that were stood up in, like, dance clubs.  Yeah.  Yelling and screaming into the message saying, I thought you were a real man.  I thought you were a real man.  You said you were going to show up.  I thought you were a real man.  You're just a child.  You're not – you didn't show up.  I was left there.  And, you know, he's just like, beep. 
[00:19:00]  Erase.  Huh?  Was he married?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I want to keep it.  Message erased.  Erased.  These days I want to keep it really vague.  I really don't know, to be honest with you.  But then you had his boys trying to get into his locked compound.  And then you had – the best was the car dealer guy.  Car dealer.  Car dealer guy begging for the car back that he gave him for, like, I don't know, six months.  And then the lease or something was up, like, well over, like, six months, eight months.  He goes, we really need the car now. 
[00:19:30]  You're going to have to bring this back.  He's like, I think we've been more than fair.  Can you just please bring the car back?  Yeah, it was some really entertaining stuff.  Dude, we couldn't get enough of this.  But the thing was, I mean –  What self-control that we didn't play that on the air.  Yeah.  Especially back then.  We really didn't know anything.  But he had women in every city.  And they're like, I see that you're coming through L.A.  You know?  A lot of these ballplayers, dude, it's amazing.  They are just in other cities with just the guys. 
[00:20:00]  So that's why I wonder about A-Rod and the purse.  I know who it is.  Was it oil can, boy?  Oil can.  Yeah.  Oil can.  He went crazy, ripped his clothes off, ran around the field, and then took off with a hooker.  I would have went with Mark Fendritsch.  Fendritsch.  Was it Fred Lynn?  Fred Lynn.  It was Carl LeFisk.  We're going a little too local for Boston today.  Will you stop?  Was it Roley Fingers? 
[00:20:30]  Roley?  I don't think he even played for Boston.  I'm just bringing up old names.  You should have went with Louie Teodtch.  Anyway, so.  Not necessarily a baseball player, by the way.  Oh, no, I know.  That's all we'll say.  But the point I'm making, I'm wondering if this girl stepped up and started playing ball.  Like, look, look, you know, what am I?  Just a blank to you? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  You know, why can't you just walk into the hotel with me?  Yeah.  What's the matter?  Can't you just walk in?  Because he was probably like, you know, looking around.  I see some people here.  We best not go.  Oh, I'm good enough for you to take upstairs, but I'm not good enough to walk through the front door.  That's what I'm thinking.  And he's just weighing it.  Yeah.  He's just sitting there going like, oh, what a.  Oh, this is a tough one, Alex.  Should I take the whore in the building with me? 
[00:21:30]  Or should I just leave?  Because I'm in trouble.  If I tell her to go upstairs by herself.  Ah, that's tough.  She's already fighting me about walking through the front door.  And I got an A-Rod, if you know what I mean.  Yeah.  I'm really, I'm really horny.  All right.  Okay.  Alex, I'm going to walk her through the front door.  Oh, it was the wrong move.  And his mind, he's like, ah, what are the odds? 
[00:22:00]  What are the odds that someone would actually take a picture?  Oh, no.  Oopsie daisy.  No press, no press.  I'm going to get laid.  No press.  I'm going to get laid.  And stop.  Oh, the press is here.  Oh.  Things that get you divorced.  Things your wife would be angry about.  Things that get a frying pan thrown at you. 
[00:22:30]  Things that make you look stupid after losing game after game.  Busty Blonde.  Yes.  You got it.  With a loose blouse.  Blouse.  Can we add blouse to the list of words we like saying?  Yes.  We haven't added any words in a while.  Since.  Since.  What's his name?  Bortz.  Oh, Neil.  Bortz.  Since Neil Bortz. 
[00:23:00]  What a tool.  Neil Bortz.  Yeah, that was just some poor judgment on A-Rod's part.  There you have it.  So this is going to be interesting for the next few days.  Let's see what the wife says.  Huh?  Have her meet you somewhere.  He just couldn't.  She must be that damn good is what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  You know what?  Ah, what the hell.  I'll just.  I'm all in.  I'm all in.  I'm going all in.  I'm bluffing. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, geez.  They're calling me.  Oh, no.  Maybe she's just funny and fun to be with.  Yeah.  They just hung out, watched a movie.  She did Susan Waldman impressions all night and kept A-Rod in stitches.  Did you say Susan Waldman?  I did.  Why?  Do we have a clip?  Oh, we just might.  We couldn't possibly have a clip of Susan Waldman.  She sounds like her mouth is wet.  Like wetter than a mouth.  Like you can picture a spittle building up as it would in a manic depressive when they yell.  Roger Clemens is in George's box and Roger Clemens is coming back. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things, of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, Roger Clemens standing  right in George Steinbrenner's box, announcing he is back.  Roger Clemens is a New York Yankee.  And there we go, John.  You don't have to worry about who's going to take the rotation.  What about the excitement?  Oh, the madness is building.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee, Doug.  What?  What?  What?  What? 
[00:24:30]  Grin on Jorge Posada's face.  Andy Pettit knew.  Big size Roger Clemens is now a Yankee.  Attention fans.  He is here.  And now we don't have to discuss who takes that place of the rotation.  Oh, heavens to Betsy.  I gotta tell you, he's up in George's box.  They would have got a reaction if this busty blonde was in Steinbrenner's box.  A busty blonde and A-Rod walking into a hotel together.  Heavens to Murgatroyd. 
[00:25:00]  But Posada was grinning.  Grinning.  Had it new.  And apparently, what was A-Rod laughing at a marmadue carton?  No one cares.  The excitement of the Yankee dugout.  Yeah, right.  Well, there are six.  As Gatorade is being sipped.  I believe there's six and fourteen since that dramatic moment.  And now she is the ass.  It's the greatest thing I've ever heard.  Oh, it's fantastic.  As she was talking, Sterling should have just went,  Minasai!  Minasai!  Minasai!  Minasai! 
[00:25:30]  A yelling douche!  A-Rod!  Ben A-Bomb!  From A-Rod!  Is it?  Wow.  Yeah, that's an A-Bomb, all right.  He's blowing up his marriage.  Blowing his bank account in half.  Yeah.  A-Rod touched all the bases in that hotel, huh?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  A-Rod's bank account is under 500.  Batting on... 
[00:26:00]  Get it?  F?  No?  Oops.  I cursed at myself and then crashed me.  Hey, before we take a break, did we say Fred Lynn?  Yes.  We did mention Fred Lynn?  I said Fred Lynn.  Oh, very good, Jimmy.  Very good.  I did throw out a Freddie Lynn line.  My favorite was Mark Fendrich.  He pitched for the Orioles.  Did he pitch for the...  I didn't know he pitched for the Red Sox.  Red Sox?  My God, he pitched for the...  Of course he did.  Yes.  I don't remember.  All right.  Well...  I believe you.  We're going to have some fun with the A-Rod story today. 
[00:26:30]  And...  Oh.  Can we talk about the infected guy next?  What the hell's wrong with people?  Mr. Selfish.  Mr. Selfish.  We'll talk about him next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Ah, good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show?  Jimmy was laughing uncontrollably as we went to break.  This is another headline on the A-Rod thing.  You all right, Jimmy?  Hey! 
[00:27:00]  He's taking his nose strip off.  Oh.  All right.  It's a very sensitive procedure.  Our phone number, 877-212-5762.  Why were you laughing?  Why don't you share it with the audience there, Jimmy?  It's just one of the awful post's headlines again.  And they are the worst, but it made me laugh.  It was apparently the inside of the post on the A-Rod article that said,  He's a Yankee Doodle Randy.  I just thought that was...  A Yankee Doodle Randy.  Just the greatest slash most awful thing I've ever heard. 
[00:27:30]  I hate the word Randy when it comes to that.  Ooh, you want to get Randy.  Yeah, it's one of those Aussie or British words.  Off the instant feedback, where you can find on our website,  Jim Cassidy from Syracuse.  He writes,  Who are these Yankees you speak of?  Life outside Syracuse is scary.  Don't worry.  They're listening to a radio show from the Bank City.  We're a bunch of douches just like you. 
[00:28:00]  Trust me on that one.  Hey, we were talking about funny baseball names.  So, E-Rock, bravo to E-Rock today.  He found the top 13 unfortunate yet funny baseball player names.  It's a quickie.  In 13th place, you got Gaylord Perry.  I always laughed at that name when I was a kid.  Good old Gaylord Perry.  Gaylord.  12th place, you got Mackie.  Mackie Sasser.  Mackie Sasser.  The Mackie Sasser? 
[00:28:30]  Of course.  And my favorite, Rollie Fingers.  Number 11.  It's Raleigh.  I call him Rollie because he would roll that mustache.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  He had the mustache.  Yeah, he was going to pitch the game after he tied a damsel to the train tracks.  10th place, you got Chili Davis, of course.  Yes.  Funny baseball names here.  In 9th place, good old Oil Can Boyd.  Oil Can.  He kind of went crazy, didn't he? 
[00:29:00]  I don't know.  Remember there was that period of time where he ripped his clothes off and ran down the street?  Yeah, he did all sorts of fun stuff.  He kind of lost his mind a little bit.  He wore more bling than any other player ever, I think, when he was pitching.  Oil Can.  Now, number 8, you got to listen closely.  It's Mike Sweeney.  Yeah.  But if you say it like that other name that ends in Hunt, you can have a little fun with Mike Sweeney's name.  Oh, because if you say it fast, Mike Sweeney. 
[00:29:30]  It sounds like Mike Sweeney.  And that's why he made the list.  Yeah.  Unfortunate yet funny baseball player names.  7th place, Coco Crisp.  Who's Coco Crisp?  Yeah, I need to know more about Coco Crisp.  Is he in the WWE?  That doesn't sound like a baseball name.  Number 6, Lenny Dykstra.  Why?  Oh, the Dyke.  Dyke being in there is, you know, it's like the Gaylord Perry.  By the way, Jimmy, you're going to be very disappointed because Bob Appadaka, he didn't make the list. 
[00:30:00]  In 5th place, you got Chien Ming Wang.  Right.  Get it?  Wang.  Yeah.  Number 4 is stupid.  Number 4 is stupid because it's not his real name.  The Big Unit.  Randy Johnson.  Right.  They don't call him that for his wins in postseason play.  No.  The Yankees.  Big Unit is actually a nickname because he's a tall, skinny guy. 
[00:30:30]  And, well, we also have John Holmes, and we know what happens when you're tall, skinny, and you look like a hick.  That's where his nickname comes from.  Oh, my God, guys.  We really should know Coco Crisp.  He plays for the first place Boston Red Sox.  Does he?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  And he also played with Cleveland.  And we love Cleveland, too, so there you go.  Sorry that we didn't know Coco Crisp.  Yeah, let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  Mikey.  Yo.  Yo.  Hey.  You're getting a big one.  Your name is Booth Bonser.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Booth.  Booth.  Number 3 is Frankenberry.  That's right.  And then Amos Otis played for the Royals.  In third place, you got Milton Bradley.  That's a game company.  That's a funny baseball player name.  And second place, good old Mookie Wilson.  Right.  From the Metropolitans.  And the number one unfortunate yet funny baseball player name is? 
[00:31:30]  No way.  Who did this guy play for?  Probably old school.  Yeah.  I think he also played for the Boston Red Sox.  Did he play for the Red Sox?  Oh, it's all about Boston today.  See what we do.  Tomorrow could be about, I don't know, Providence.  Ladies and gentlemen, now introducing Boston's Red Sox own Dick Paul.  Dick Paul.  You know, that's his name? 
[00:32:00]  You know, when you get old enough, you just got to walk up to your parents and slap them  in the face.  What were you thinking?  Our last name's Paul.  Did you have to name me Richard?  You might want to stay away from Richard.  Richard.  No, I think they'll really just call him Richard.  Oh, do you?  Do you really think?  That's probably just a nickname the fans gave him.  Yeah.  Maybe.  But that's your number one funny baseball player name.  Albert Pudge?  What?  What?  Yes, Danny? 
[00:32:30]  I always thought an unfortunate baseball name was Albert Pujols.  Oh, Pujols.  That's like the worst one ever.  That isn't even spelt right.  It's like Pudged.  I don't like the fact that Danny leaned in and used the proper word.  He goes, I always thought an unfortunate baseball name.  Unfortunate baseball name.  Get out of here, Danny.  I'm crashing you.  You see the list of players that almost made the list?  Like Frank Funk.  That's worse than Mike Sweeney. 
[00:33:00]  Well, Mike Sweeney because you're doing the Beavis and Butthead thing and laughing at Mike Sweeney.  Frank Funk.  Any others on here that?  Ivy Wingo.  Creepy Crespi.  Creepy Crespi.  Sibby Sisti.  The rest are just weird.  Turn-of-the-century type names that no one uses anymore.  Those are unfortunate baseball names, as Danny said. 
[00:33:30]  Danny, what a phony Danny.  I always thought an unfortunate baseball name.  No, you didn't.  You've never said unfortunate before, stupid.  All right.  Hey, what's going on with Disease Guy?  Are we safe here in New York?  Who knows?  He was here in New York.  He was at Bellevue for a while.  Well, the Daily News.  This guy's traveling around like a jet setter.  He's hacking up tuberculosis.  Well, man, I mean, you know, the Post had a fun, fun front page today.  The stray rod that we talked about already.  Daily News has deadly germ scare. 
[00:34:00]  Fed's quarantined man infected with super strain of tuberculosis.  It's a super strain?  What's that?  What does that mean?  Super strain.  Very resistant to treatment.  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Fatal.  Oh, boy.  But, you know, it's treatable, but it's resistant.  And this idiot made two overseas flights.  What a douche.  Went to France.  Knowing he was really sick?  Yeah, he was warned not to go.  He was warned not to go.  This is the first U.S. government ordered quarantine since 63. 
[00:34:30]  And, yeah, they slapped this guy away somewhere in Atlanta.  The infected man flew from Atlanta to Paris on May 12th aboard an Air France flight.  He returned to North America.  All right, wait, wait.  Can I slow you down?  Sure.  We all get sick just from some idiot getting on a plane with a cold.  Regular cold.  So what does this mean?  They're looking for everybody that was sitting around this guy.  Are you kidding?  Meanwhile, it's like I'd be scared if I was on the same plane.  You know how they ventilate those planes? 
[00:35:00]  Of course, yeah.  So they're looking for people that sat in front of them and next to them and behind them.  And they want to give them the skin test first.  And then if you test positive for that, they're going to check you a little more thoroughly to see if you have this TB, tuberculosis.  What year is this?  And this idiot decides to fly because he didn't want to miss his wedding.  His wedding?  A wedding.  I heard it was his wedding on my way in.  Well, then.  I hope it was. 
[00:35:30]  I hope he gave his wife TB.  How could you blame the guy?  The man told the health officials he wasn't coughing during the flights.  Well.  I hate this guy.  The more I'm reading, I hate this guy.  Why, Jimmy?  What did you say?  And it's getting on with it.  The, uh, like, uh, that's his, I'm like coughing on the flights.  Yeah, I wasn't coughing.  You got TB, you idiot.  But he was ordered, a CDC official reached this guy by phone in Rome and told him not to take commercial flights. 
[00:36:00]  The Center for Disease Control.  Yeah.  Called him in Rome and said, do not take flights.  But he flew back anyway.  But he flew back to North America anyway.  Oh, my God.  What a jackass.  A jackass.  And he was told in early May that he had a form of TB that was resistant to first-line antibiotics.  And it was advised not to travel to Europe.  So, not only did he, he didn't listen twice.  Right?  Yeah.  He didn't listen twice.  And, uh, he's a pompous ass. 
[00:36:30]  And now he is getting what he deserves, which is to be thrown out, thrown away.  You're not going to infect the rest of the country because you can't take, uh, you know, you can't, you can't listen.  There have been 17 U.S. XDR-TB, this extremely, uh, drug-resistant TB since 2000.  Three-quarters were people from foreign countries.  There was a Russian man who arrived and was jailed after he stopped taking medications and went unmasked to a restaurant and other businesses. 
[00:37:00]  That's great.  That's good.  Just keep the gates open, U.S.  Just let everybody in.  It's just wonderful.  Well, wasn't he from America to be done?  I don't know.  I don't care.  No, I'm talking about three-quarters.  It says three-quarters of them.  Okay.  Were, uh, people from foreign countries.  All right, I got it.  Are we supposed to quarantine people?  Didn't they even do that way back in ye olde days where they went to Ellis Island and, and, like, threw that white powder on you to de-louse you?  I think everybody stepping off a plane should be de-loused. 
[00:37:30]  De-loused.  Just throw powder.  Imagine that Welcome to America.  Poof.  Like that scene from Shawshank.  Poof.  All right, get your clothes.  All right, well, there you go.  They need a good de-lousing.  So, uh, the news department is following that story very closely.  The Opie and Anthony news department.  Yeah.  Apparently they brought him up to Bellevue here in New York.  Yeah.  Thank you.  And, uh, he was, uh, quarantined there for a while while they did some tests and then they flew him back down to Atlanta where he's now sitting, him and his tuberculosis. 
[00:38:00]  Yeesh.  I think we're all a little scared now, so now we gotta get happy.  Well, if you start coughing and coughing up blood.  Yeah.  Uh, hmm.  Could be some trouble.  By the way, uh, Jimmy Fallon's gonna be on the show today at 8 o'clock.  Also, Big A.  What you flying for, Lunger?  What that?  Come on.  Great laughing.  Sorry.  Last time I...  It was, um, OK Corral. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, which one was it, Tombstone?  That was a good one.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  All right, sorry.  Uh...  Keep hitting that beep first.  Because I curse and then I crash.  Last time I saw Jimmy Fallon was in the, uh, Newark airport years ago.  I was going, uh, wherever I was going and he came up and had something...  Terriculosis?  Yes.  Did he have TB?  We coughed on each other.  I said, aren't you the guy?  He goes, yes, and we coughed.  No, he said some complimentary things about the Opie and Anthony program.  He did?  Yes.  Why didn't you ever tell us that? 
[00:39:00]  I probably forgot.  We're huge fans of Jimmy Fallon.  It was years ago.  We had him on years ago.  What'd you do now?  All right, listen.  We're all sad because of that story.  So why don't we do the stage, uh, dive chick real fast?  Ah.  Stage diving into nowhere.  Love the car.  I hate this song.  I want to smack her.  We'll get shot.  We'll get shot, my baby.  We'll get shot.  We'll get shot.  Woo!  Oh.  I have to play the isolated clip. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, where is she?  Yeah, she was done with her little song, decided to stage dive, and no one was there.  When she does that doggy bark thing, I just want to smack her.  We should have someone imitate her.  One of the boys on staff should imitate that.  Woo, woo, woo, woo.  Here she is.  Woo, woo, woo, woo.  Here's the, uh, amplified version.  Ah! 
[00:40:00]  Oh!  She stage dives, and no one's there to pick her up.  Hits the floor.  Yeah.  Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.  Oh!  Gonna get ya!  It's a terrible song.  By the way, I love Mexico today.  Uh, just moving on quickly here.  Have you seen the video of, um, well, we got lots to do today.  Mexico, what happened?  Uh, Miss.  Miss USA getting booed?  Yeah.  Check out that video.  It's hilarious.  I know.  She falls right on her ass. 
[00:40:30]  Well, obviously, they did, uh, what?  Miss Universe, or, uh, down there in Mexico this time around?  Yeah, here she is.  Oh!  And, uh, she came out, and, you know, Mexico, eh, they're not big fans of the U.S.  No.  The ones that have to stay there anyway.  There's a lot of people that are big fans of the U.S. that used to live in, uh, Mexico.  Skip over the border.  But the ones that don't make it, you know what?  They're not big fans of, uh, the U.S.  No.  Miss Universe, Paget was down there in Mexico, so Miss USA, uh, she gets booed during introduction. 
[00:41:00]  They just, they just couldn't, they just had it with, uh, with this, uh, this broad.  And, uh, and she didn't do anything wrong, but she had the big U.S.A. on her chest, and  that's all it took for Mexico to go, go nuts over.  Boo.  So, uh, here you go.  El Boo.  Hello.  Keep a judge.  Ooh.  Yes. 
[00:41:30]  Okay.  Oh, she did acknowledge it.  Okay.  I'm like, why aren't the hosts...  Is that her or the host?  Yeah, the host.  That's the host.  The host is...  Uh, that used to be on MTV, right?  What's her name?  She speaks a little Spanish?  Uh, Martha Quinn.  Oh, you worked with her, Jimmy.  You worked with her.  Nina Blackwood.  No!  That's Nina Blackwood.  J.J. Jackson?  I beat her up in Vice Squad.  No, she...  Did you?  She, uh, she, uh, she goes out with Nick Lachey.  Yeah, her name is Vanessa Manila.  Yeah, no, I know.  Yeah, there you go. 
[00:42:00]  Thank you, Kenny.  She's actually very nice.  She was one of the few people that would have me on and help promote...  We were returning to the airwaves in 2004.  Ooh.  Very nice, and she also wore a fat suit, though.  Yeah, I know she was.  One of the many.  Oh, she's, uh, one...  Okay, now I remember who she is.  Yeah, I was wondering if they were gonna acknowledge that, uh, Miss USA there was getting booed real  loud, and finally in Spanish, she said, one moment, please.  One moment, please.  One moment, please.  That's an acknowledgement?  How about shut up?  Yeah, when you hear that...  Have some respect.  When you're part of a booing crowd and you hear, one moment, please, you know what? 
[00:42:30]  I, I shut up right away.  Yeah.  One moment, please.  So, oh, oh, oh, tick-a-lock, tick-a-lock.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[00:43:00]  I think they're just chanting.  Do you want me to tell you?  Well, hold on.  How about is it?  Let me guess.  How about is it?  Is it thanks for every modern day invention?  Thanks for every modern day invention.  Or half of us will be there next year.  Half of us will be there next year.  I don't think that's it either.  Is it here's some more diarrhea? 
[00:43:30]  What could they be chanting?  I don't know.  More anti-U.S. sentiment?  Swim, run, flee.  Swim, run, flee.  How about thanks for not just walking in and taking over this dump.  Thanks for not just walking in and taking over this dump.  What were they chanting?  What could they possibly have been chanting?  I can't figure it out.  If you could go back and relive one moment in your life, what moment would you pick and why? 
[00:44:00]  The one right before I arrived here so I could just keep driving.  Do you know how great that would have been if she said the one right before I walked out so I wouldn't have to hear these idiots calling me?  She should have thrown the competition right now.  Well, they're chanting Mexico.  That was Mexico?  Mm-hmm.  That's not bad.  Mexico.  They love their country.  Yeah.  The audience is not interested in her response to the question.  Oh.  I would have to say I would go back to January of 2007 when I traveled to South Africa to volunteer at the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa. 
[00:44:30]  I'm very passionate about education and being there in South Africa just sparked my interest even more for education and all that I can do for that.  I would go back to September 10th, you idiot, 2001, and say, excuse me, I believe there's going to be a problem tomorrow.  Excuse me, please don't do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They booed her for going to South Africa because they're all fans of Prime Minister Boltha. 
[00:45:00]  Boltha.  And they don't like the regime for all of those people.  That's great because she's the same one that fell.  So she falls on the stage.  She was just in a panic.  Living hell.  Living hell.  She falls on the stage and then she just gets booed at by the Mexican crowd there.  So there you go.  All right.  That's very rude.  I don't think that happens in the U.S. when they have the contest in the United States.  I've never seen a contestant being heckled.  I'll tell you why.  Yeah, because we don't heckle in America. 
[00:45:30]  Why is that?  Because everyone looks at us like we're the champions.  We're the best ones and that's the problem.  And we're the big – we are – when you're Mexico.  Yeah.  And you have America above you.  It's got to be awful.  We're Mexico.  We have to transcend all that stuff as Americans.  We have to be better than that.  I don't think we care enough about other countries.  Oh, like all of a sudden Miss whatever.  She'd have to be Miss Bin Laden or Francis Al-Qaeda. 
[00:46:00]  It would have to be such an obvious connection.  We would boo.  We're polite idiots.  If Miss Iran was there, we'd be nice to her.  Like, oh, isn't that courageous?  She's not a member of that regime.  We are nice about certain things.  Isn't she beautiful?  Yes.  Can't see her.  No.  Yeah, can't see her.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We got lots to do today, man.  We still have to do the cleavage story from yesterday.  Yeah.  It's a cute little story.  We also want to talk about the man dressed as Captain America, accused of groping women. 
[00:46:30]  Another Disney accident to get into and other things coming in as we speak.  Also, oh, yeah, Pamela Anderson had explained to the kids that she made a porn.  Oh, the kids are getting older?  How old are they?  I don't know.  We'll get into that story as well.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:47:00]  The O and A virus spreading across America.  Want to say hi to Cleveland.  King James got the job done last night.  Hi, Ant.  You see the game?  Oh, no.  No?  No.  What was the highlight of the game for you?  For me?  You already said the NCAA is ready.  Well, it was, uh...  Yeah.  I didn't watch.  Why would I watch?  Cavaliers are playing who?  Oh, couldn't tell you.  Series. 
[00:47:30]  Where are we at with the series?  Um, you're talking about basketball?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, I don't know.  Detroit.  What?  Uh.  Is that a guess?  Be honest.  No.  Pal Talk is helping me.  Oh, you bastards on Pal Talk.  Enjoy, uh, King James, though.  The rumor is Jay-Z is bringing him to Brooklyn in a few years. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, yeah?  When the Brooklyn Nets, uh, uh, start up.  Well, that I kind of know, that the Nets being brought to Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Why are they moving there?  Building them a place and everything, right?  Yeah, yeah.  What are we, uh, two years out at this point?  Something like that?  Yeah.  King James will be a Brooklyn Nets.  Can I point out how stupid I am for saying they're building them a place there, too?  Like, what's the other option?  Behind, behind, like, the Brooklyn School of Technical Learning?  That's how stupid I am. 
[00:48:30]  They're going to be the only NBA team that plays on a playground.  Imagine.  They have to commute to Jersey.  Right.  We don't believe in stadiums.  We're going to play our games on a playground.  How cool would that be?  That would be perfect for Brooklyn, right?  Yeah.  All right, our phone number is 877-212-5762.  That's 877-212-5762.  Joe from Jersey, he writes on the instant feedback, Jill, Nicolini's boobs are looking awesome today,  guys.  Oh, don't tell us.  Can you guys repost our Playboy pics again, please? 
[00:49:00]  Well, Jill Nicolini.  I'm sorry we have to go local again, but Jill Nicolini is a Long Island broad, and she's  got the raspy voice today, so we think she might have went and saw Zebra last night somewhere  on Long Island.  Maybe at Mulcahy's.  She was out on Long Island till all hours, seeing some local band, I bet.  She's a typical Long Island girl, making good.  She's extremely hot, and they don't know what to do with her on the local news here in New 
[00:49:30]  York.  And she was in a helicopter for a while, but they realized that doesn't really show off  her assets, so now they got her doing the traffic.  From the studio, with traffic graphics and all kinds of things, like you would do the  weather, only it's traffic, which is ridiculous.  Basically, she's getting ready to get the old broad out of there that does do the weather.  Yeah.  It's like she's doing weather, but it's for traffic, because traffic's a lot easier  to do, because you don't have to figure out fronts and stuff. 
[00:50:00]  No, you don't have to know anything.  You just got to see if there's a roadway that is red.  That could be a problem.  If it's blinking red, then you say, ooh, there's some traffic.  All you need to know is how a traffic light works, and you can do traffic on the news.  It's easy.  See, they're starting with the very light lifting with her.  Yeah.  But she's going to be a star, and we want to be on this very early.  And so Jill Nicolini is starting to wear these crazy outfits to do her traffic reports  on Channel 11 here in New York, showing nothing but ample cleavage. 
[00:50:30]  Ample cleavage and boobage.  She had some kind of weird sweater thing.  Oh, this is great this morning.  She had some kind of sweater on with this big sweeping neckline.  Very loose fitting.  You know those sweaters with the very loose neckline that goes down well below her breast?  I believe it's some kind of a scoop.  Yeah, it's like a scoop neck thing.  Right, but it goes all the way down.  It could go back and forth a little bit.  It's very loose around the neck.  Yeah, it goes all the way down to her midsection.  Yeah, her midsection.  And then under that, she was wearing a very tight pink shirt. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  And the swooping neck was to one side, so a single breast was just kind of popping out  over the edge of this sweeping neckline.  It was struggling.  Sweeping neckline.  It was struggling to free itself.  Yeah.  And she's doing the traffic.  The first time, the first glimpse we got of her in the office this morning, all you heard  was, oh, oh, look, oh.  And the best is when she's done with her dumb traffic report that no one's paying attention  to.  Trust me, they're just trying to get her on camera and get her used to the studio. 
[00:51:30]  Eventually, she'll be sitting behind the anchor desk.  Of course.  You know?  Of course.  And it's so funny when she's done with the traffic, they go to the next broad, and they're  supposed to be looking at the camera, but they have to quickly turn their heads  toward the camera, because they're in amazement, like, oh, my, she's getting away with murder  with the stuff she's wearing.  Yeah.  And then they went to poor old Linda, who I think is a fan of the show, by the way, because  we did that news program about a year ago, a year ago.  Oh, no. 
[00:52:00]  She's a fan.  What are you going to say?  Oh, no.  When the interview was done, she's like, I'm a big fan of you guys.  I'll listen when I can.  Anyway, they go to her, and she's wearing, like, an outfit your aunt would wear to a  communion party or something.  She's wearing a button-down shirt, all buttoned up.  Right.  With pearls.  With a grandma's pearl necklace on.  And it looks like she wants to strangle herself with the pearls, because she knows that time  is against her at this point.  You know, that time is a bitch.  We all know it, right?  Yeah.  So then she, like, quickly looks toward the camera, because she got a glimpse of what 
[00:52:30]  Jill was wearing.  And there she is, all conservative, with her pearls around her neck.  And then, fast forward 15 minutes for the next time she's on camera, all of a sudden  she lost, like, the sweater she had on, and she lost the pearl necklace.  The pearls were gone.  She's just trying to sex it up to try to compete with the young one.  Yeah.  That's a tough sell.  Enough about the New York talk. 
[00:53:00]  What about Katie Horner?  She does weather in Kansas City.  What do you talk about, Katie?  I don't know.  Katie Horner?  Is that a real name?  Oh, sure.  All right.  And then let's all Google Katie Horner.  Let's see what she's about.  She does weather in Kansas City.  Really?  Is she any good?  Yeah.  But we're the only city in America that has a hot broad doing traffic.  Traffic.  You know what's really sexy, though?  It was the one in Chicago, Karen Meyer.  Oh, please. 
[00:53:30]  Hello, Chicago.  Karen Meyer.  All right.  This is Cleavage.  A little leftover from yesterday.  And then we got Big A coming into the studio in a few minutes here.  We haven't talked to him in a while.  But when is Cleavage okay to show?  Listen up, ladies.  Always.  There was a woman on TV yesterday.  She had the itty-bitties.  And she obviously not a big fan of the Cleavage.  No.  For the most part. 
[00:54:00]  Well, the next segment was inspired by an article from Moore Magazine about plunging necklines.  Plunging.  And then plunging further.  And plunging in all directions.  You can't go to get a breakfast waffle without all that cleavage out there.  So is it a good thing in the workplace?  How do you really feel?  I had a chance to talk to an expert.  Elizabeth Squires.  His new book on the matter hits stores.  Remember, Elizabeth is...  She's awful.  She's a bit doggy.  Oh.  Jesus.  Did they answer it to say you can't go get a breakfast waffle? 
[00:54:30]  Could you have picked a more awful example to use for cleavage, you idiot?  Oh, do you realize when you say a bit doggy, you're not helping by putting in a bit?  Like you would think that would be like, well, in case she's listening, I'll just say, she's a bit doggy.  I was just trying to soften it a little bit.  Not a total dog.  Just a bit doggish.  She actually looks like Stephen Hawking.  Talked to an expert. 
[00:55:00]  Elizabeth Squires.  His new book on the matter hits stores this fall.  So at the risk of sounding like a real square, it seems to me that everybody is confused by the fact that everything's so low-cut out there all the time.  And there are no longer any clear sort of respectful rules.  Too much cleavage in every place that you see.  And part of that is what we are wearing these days.  We're wearing tighter, more fitted clothes, tighter jeans.  So everything's out there. 
[00:55:30]  She's just not a fan of the cleavage.  No.  Cleavage in the workplace, it has its place.  Certain women can get away with it.  Certain women use it to their advantage in the workplace.  Others, wear the button-down shirts buttoned up to your neck and the pearls.  You know what I don't understand?  The butchie ones.  Why don't they show the cleavage?  Never.  For the most part, you never see that.  Flannel shirts.  Buttoned up flannel. 
[00:56:00]  Still in the grunge.  Like Rosie O'Donnell never really shows cleavage.  Why is that?  Because she is what is called a flatso.  Which is the worst kind of female.  Worst kind of overweight person ever is the one that has the big gut, big fat, fat legs, fat ass,  but were just cursed by God to not have the big breasts.  Because even the guys, the chubby chasers out there, they want the big boobs. 
[00:56:30]  They don't want the flatso, which is the fat girl with the flat chest.  And Rosie is indeed a flatso.  That's the bonus with going with a fatter girl.  You're at least getting the big...  You get a bit more ample boobage.  Right.  And you were saying earlier, too, that everybody thinks guys,  everyone thinks men will automatically prefer lower cut,  but studies have shown men do not even prefer larger breasts. 
[00:57:00]  Because women overestimate the size of breasts that men prefer.  And studies have shown that in the workplace especially,  men think that women who are medium-sized breasts,  they rank them higher on the personal and professional scale.  Oh, really?  There are studies that show that you actually get docked in people's minds for your professionalism.  Yes, because it is a distraction.  People are looking at your cleavage.  They're not looking and they're not thinking about your skills.  and they're not focused on the task at hand.  Ever appropriate to show cleavage in the workplace? 
[00:57:30]  Never?  Never.  How about a VH stripper?  Ladies, give us a call.  Is it appropriate?  Could there be an unsexier conversation between two unsexy women?  Diane Sawyer's ancient and this other one just had a rotten little head.  It's prude.  At this point, you can't even tell it's Diane Sawyer on TV anymore  because of the Vaseline they're using on the lenses.  That high def is a bitch, huh, Diane?  Vaseline, they're spreading oatmeal on there now  just to try to obscure any view of her whatsoever. 
[00:58:00]  That cleavage thing is...  This could be a very, very sexy thing to talk about.  They're making it so unsexy.  Cleavage is very clinical.  Right.  They're talking, but it is true.  I will say it's true that I think some women do overestimate the size that men do enjoy.  Right.  Because I don't think a majority of the guys out there love the gargantuan breasts.  Dude, we were doing that bit for each other coming back from Dan Mason's home.  Oh, God, yeah.  I got to be honest with you.  And I saw this girl, it might insult some women out there, that was just monstrous. 
[00:58:30]  She was definitely put together very well, but she had huge boobs.  And there was just a skinny little guy with her, excuse me, walking down the street.  And Ant and I started laughing so hard because we're like, I always stayed away from the big boobie monsters.  The huge breasted women.  Because I always felt like I couldn't take them to a family function because my whole family would just think I'm a pervert.  Like, oh, we all know why you're coming out with her. 
[00:59:00]  Like, they'd all just be looking at her breasts.  It wouldn't be, you could introduce her and it would just be staring at the cleavage.  Right.  And then, you know, when she goes and you and her go off after you introduce her to somebody, a relative, and you walk away, you know they're going to go, oh, my God.  You see the cans on her?  What the hell's wrong with your kid?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, what, what, did you not feed him when he was like, oh, baby, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Obviously, you didn't breastfeed him, right, yeah. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  They'd all just constantly be talking about her boobs.  I don't think your family could get past the fact that you're dating a woman that has really large boobs.  Yeah, because then they would think.  And you could explain all you want, like, no, you don't understand.  Great girl.  Great girl, good conversation.  We just get along.  She's my soulmate, blah, blah, blah.  And then, you know, you take her to a picnic, and she's trying to play volleyball to fit in, and she's just got these monstrous boobs that are getting in the way.  She can't even cut watermelon without it being a major distraction.  No, just the jiggling over her, the melon over the picnic table. 
[01:00:00]  It's one of those things, too, where you don't want to – you can walk around in front of your mother or your grandmother, and they would never know whatever fetish you have.  But if you bring this giant-breasted woman over, that kind of tells them, like, oh, my God, he's got a big booby fetish.  The guy loves big boobs.  And there's something kind of embarrassing about that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's kind of like –  As a guy, it's kind of embarrassing that your family is thinking that. 
[01:00:30]  In front of your friends, fine.  Whatever, right, sure.  In front of you, you know, you're out on the town, and strangers, fine.  But then, you know, grandma and mommy, and you're just kind of, hey, you know, this is my girl, and oh, my God, what did I raise?  I raised this perverted monster that just loves cans.  That would be a bit embarrassing.  And then they would just picture –  It's so hard.  Who's not – like, what uncle of yours isn't picturing what you're probably doing to them? 
[01:01:00]  Right.  You know?  And he's talking with the other uncles.  It gets warm out.  She's got to wear shorts and then just a tiny – not a tiny, but any top looks tiny.  The smallest top she could wear in public, you know, she would wear.  And then maybe a pool party at the relative's house.  And she's in a bathing suit, bikini or something, and everyone's just, oh, your son is just an animal. 
[01:01:30]  Your son is a pervert.  Oh, what's wrong with him?  So he likes those big, big girls, the girls with the big, you know, they don't know how to say it.  She's just trying to fit in.  She takes her sweatshirt off to jump in the pool, and you can feel the whole pool area just going –  And she doesn't – she doesn't have a clue.  She just does that thing where she crosses her arms, takes her shirt off.  Hi, come on in.  The water's great.  Yeah, yeah.  They're just bobbing up and down like a couple of buoys. 
[01:02:00]  Your mom just rolling her eyes.  Oh, just embarrassed.  What did I raise?  And she might be the greatest girl ever, but no one's going to listen to you.  Not going to look at it that way.  They're just going to think you love massive boobs and that you're a shallow person.  Right.  Dave in Massachusetts, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I don't know if you guys ever watch Telemundo.  I don't understand the word of it, but in the morning, their weather broadcaster is incredible. 
[01:02:30]  Telemundo.  Oh, have you seen her?  They got – yeah, they got videos of her on break.com and the rest of the video sites.  The control is sticky every morning, buddy.  Of course I've seen her.  Jesus.  Ugh.  All right, Dave, thank you.  You might want to check her out, though, yeah.  Maybe E-Rock could find a video.  Okay, hey, cleavage has an age limit.  Ah, of course it does.  Got a shelf life.  Okay, now let's take a woman in her 50s and above.  Well, I'm going to go out on a limb. 
[01:03:00]  Okay.  And say, there is an age at which you should leave cleavage in the rearview mirror forever.  Well, that's my –  Doesn't gravity pretty much decide that?  Yes.  For the most part?  20 is the age.  Some women, though, I don't think they get it.  Huh?  Some women don't get it, though.  No.  And they're showing cleavage well into their 50s and 60s.  Dude, I got caught yesterday.  I was at a restaurant with Lindsey. 
[01:03:30]  We found this great restaurant.  There's a bunch of freaks to check out.  I love people watching, so we get the window seat and we just watch freaks going by, right?  Mm-hmm.  There was a lady, I swear to God, she was pushing 70, massive boobs, showing cleavage,  probably an old boob job, and I just turned, and I swear to God, I was disgusted, but the  lady thought that I was, like, nice, and then gave me a look like, huh?  Ah, you like this.  Let me tell you, the young guy's always looking at me. 
[01:04:00]  Are they there, honey?  And our eyes met, and it was just, like, a horrific moment that I was having with this  woman.  I'm like, no, I swear I wasn't looking like I'm thinking this is nice.  Move along, please.  But she got big eyes, like, ah?  And I'm like, uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  My girlfriend went to Victoria's Secret.  I was buying her some underpants.  Sickies.  And there was a really older woman there, and I'm like, you'd think she'd be mad if I walked  over and just tapped and go, Miss, you're too old to shop here. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, it's time to go home.  Oh, what a scene that would make.  Miss, go hug your grandchildren.  Oh, go hug your grandchildren.  You shouldn't be here.  Miss, this is, have a Metamucil and just behave yourself.  Who's going to see these on you?  The funeral director?  Oh, my God.  Might as well keep it sexy for him.  Never.  Well, that's my, that's my sense.  I think you have to dress age appropriately with your cleavage.  Think of it as a fashion accessory.  And, you know, would you wear, like, high heels in a certain place? 
[01:05:00]  You know, out in the soccer field, that might not be appropriate.  Yes, but isn't there an age beyond which even you will say, no more?  Just no more.  Nobody wants to see it cover up.  Well, women, as they get older, their breasts are not as firm and perky as they once were.  So, you don't want to push them together because you get that wrinkled cleavage look in the first place.  So, that's not the nice thing.  The wrinkly, frinkly cleavage.  That's what you want when you push them together and it's just like a couple of deflating balloons. 
[01:05:30]  Looks like a map of the Napa Valley.  If you've ever been to the Napa Valley and got a map, that is a very accurate thing you came up with.  And if you've been in the sun your whole life, tanning.  That's even worse.  Then it just looks like leather.  Dude, dopey oatmeal.  I screwed up.  Oh.  Warning.  No. 
[01:06:00]  No.  Oh, my.  I'd tell you something.  How does that not go in?  I've made an ass of myself.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  What happened here?  You're going to be okay.  What happened here?  Yeah, I said the wrong thing.  Yeah.  Wrinkled cleavage look in the first place.  So that's not the nice way to look. 
[01:06:30]  But I think if you're older and you wear a scoop neck and you have beautiful what the French call décolletage, that's gorgeous.  I think you can be sensual and sexy without showing a lot of breasts.  I think you're getting stupid.  Well, and then they end up, boy, this turned out to be a who gives a crap.  Well, it's anti-sexy.  I mean, cleavage talk should always be fun to listen to.  They made this a bore fest.  Nothing better than when your chicken waddle neck dips in between your cleavage. 
[01:07:00]  That's what you want.  They wrap up with looking at a woman in a bra, deciding if it's the right or wrong bra.  The neck dipping into the cleavage.  It looks like a turkey between two beanbag chairs.  Smells like old lady perfume.  What's the old lady perfume they all wear besides embalming fluids?  I just thought they always switch to just like baby powder.  They go back to just baby powder.  I think in general they just get more flowery with their perfumes.  They have to powder.  I'm using some type of potpourri. 
[01:07:30]  Okay, the final one is for evening, right?  The social occasion.  Wrong bra?  Wrong bra.  Yes, very wrong bra.  Beautiful look.  I mean, you can still see the nice look there.  It's still sexy and sensual.  No, it's not.  But it's not in your face cleavage.  And you don't need to have that in your face.  It should be part of the whole body.  You should take a look at that and have your breasts be part of the whole package  and not just a separate element.  Right.  All right.  Things to think about this morning because it's true. 
[01:08:00]  Every place you look, yeah, it's cleavage is the new black.  Yeah, it is.  Totally.  Thanks for joining us.  I'd love for the woman that was talking about cleavage being a bad thing to get up  and just have a horrific camel toe.  Wouldn't that be great?  Oh, that's for a later broadcast.  Oh, wow.  That's the greatest, isn't it?  Wouldn't that be great?  Oh, when it goes up to their chin and there's no idea? 
[01:08:30]  Do you know how awful you look?  Oh, that is.  And you can't take your eyes off of it.  Nothing worse than you're going through the supermarket pushing your cart  and some woman comes around the corner and you're just like, oh, my God.  You see it from an aisle down the complete length of the aisle.  You're just like, oh, wow.  There's a toothless mouth coming at you.  I saw that on a plane one time.  I got caught staring because I tend to like that.  But it's creepy to get caught staring sometimes,  but there's other times where you just feel like a disgusting lich. 
[01:09:00]  You've got to stare.  She looked at me and looked at where my eyes were going,  and she was just like, oh, I'm so sorry.  Sorry, just looking.  Help it grab your ankles and tug down before you stand up, old whore.  After the break, we're going to figure out what this is.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ow.  Ow. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  I think I know what it is now.  What is it?  I'm not going to say because I don't want to ruin it for everybody,  but I think I know.  Are you cheating again?  No, I'm not cheating at all.  All right.  No.  By the way, talking about the wrinkly cleavage,  Sam from FBA writes, it looks like combed sand.  That conjures up an image. 
[01:10:00]  That's pretty good.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, what's happening?  Opie, Anthony, little Jimmy Norton.  A lot of excitement around here.  Jimmy's going down to D.C.  I think he's leaving like tomorrow to get ready.  Yeah.  And then we're heading down.  We're heading down to support little Jimmy Norton.  He's taping his HBO special.  He's been looking forward to this for years. 
[01:10:30]  Like HBO gave him a half hour special and he was like, yeah, it's cool, but I want the hour.  I want the hour.  And he got the hour.  That's the big time.  That's the big time.  And he's shooting it on Saturday in D.C.  We're all excited.  We're taking trains down there and just hanging with little Jimmy.  I think my manager actually got me the special.  I have good management.  They pushed into the right people.  I know that was one of your...  He's going to start thanking people like a frigging award show.  I mean, I'm not...  No, this was one of his goals.  Yeah.  This is something he talked about for years.  I know. 
[01:11:00]  I'm very proud of Jimmy.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We're trying to figure out what this mystery sound is.  I thought I had it.  Mystery sound Wednesday, right?  No.  Is it an opera singer clearing her throat before an aria? 
[01:11:30]  Good one.  I never would have thought of that.  Could be.  Opi, is it?  I think it's Linda Church strangling herself with those pearls she wore this morning because  you've got to look at Jill and the Queen.  Jill.  Patrick on Long Island, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey. 
[01:12:00]  I'm going to guess that that is Tim Roth in Reservoir Dogs.  Tim Roth in Reservoir Dogs.  You did say Tim Roth, right, sir?  Yeah.  I, uh...  It could very well be Tim Roth shot in the stomach.  Sure.  Reservoir Dogs.  Oh!  Oh.  Wow, there was a surprise.  I thought that was the answer.  Damn.  I, uh...  Wanted to guess.  Okay, hold on.  Another verse.  No. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, jeez.  Tim Roth was a good guess.  That was a really good guess. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Every one of them sounds like it.  It sounds like a montage of his...  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  What's wrong with your microphone, Jimmy?  I want them to make it tight so it doesn't spin in a circle.  Just taste it like your tail.  Jimmy.  You know what?  Things stranded happens.  Jimmy.  You're mad.  HBO Saturday.  Let's keep it happy.  Let's keep it happy. 
[01:13:30]  Let's keep it happy.  It's like my performance.  What a happy song. 
[01:14:00]  You all right, Jimmy?  Terrible.  I'm sorry.  Our job is to keep you happy until Saturday.  It's the incomparable...  HBO is a big, big day for you.  Angela in Chicago, listening on WCKG.  What's up, Angela?  Oh, hi, you guys.  No, I don't have cleavage, but other than that, everything else about me is hot, but I  wish I did.  And I was just calling to answer the game.  I haven't even seen this, but I want to take a guess for the sound. 
[01:14:30]  Okay.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's got to be Christopher getting wrapped in The Sopranos.  Hmm.  Ooh.  Come on.  I have not seen that episode, so don't tell me anything.  I read it.  Ooh.  Don't tell me anything.  How long are we not supposed to tell people stuff?  Well, I know that because I already read it, but...  One week?  And you know what?  If that was it, it was such a payoff anyway, because wow, was that good.  It was an anti-climax, and the way they did it was boring and uneventful.  It was?  So that wasn't it then? 
[01:15:00]  Wow.  At the end of the episode, he was eating peyote and tap dancing in the desert.  What?  That was a little silly.  I mean, the death, the killing him thing was really chilling.  You talk, you didn't even see it, but you go ahead, you comment on it.  You know, you didn't see it, but you feel free to jump in and just chit-chat about something  you heard about.  What are you waiting for?  The box set?  How do you keep a secret?  Oh, my neighbor's taping it for me.  Cut your face.  Big listen gets whacked in the second season.  Sorry.  It gives me an excuse to go for a date.  Your neighbor's taping it for you?  Yeah, how do you keep a secret in the year 2007? 
[01:15:30]  I mean, how does your neighbor tape something for you?  I said I already know.  I'm just bragging that I could still figure it out even though I didn't see it.  I agree.  Well, your bragging was for naught.  Is that right?  No, you're so wrong.  When your neighbor tapes it for you, do you bring the tape into your old top loader VCR?  Not only are you wrong, I don't even want to take any more calls from Chicago this morning.  Oh, you've ruined it for Chicago now.  You really did.  Oh, come on.  It was a good guess.  Bye-bye.  It was awful.  Come in.  All right. 
[01:16:00]  Listen, do you want to hear it?  I have a guess.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, let me try.  Are you cheating?  No, I'm not.  All right, go.  I think it sounds like a montage of sounds from a mental institution.  These sound like retarded people.  Someone did ask if it was retarded swim lessons.  No, not necessarily swim lessons.  I mean, everything from, you know, it's time to take your medicine to it's bedtime. 
[01:16:30]  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  What medications?  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years.  Britney Spears virginity.  See, that at the end is a little throwing. 
[01:17:00]  Sounds like a montage of The Exorcist of Linda Blair.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Hey, Ope, is it people who have just seen 70-year-old cleavage?  And then this old gag, but it's always funny.  Someone from their cell phone.  The sound is E-Rock resisting a burger. 
[01:17:30]  And then weeping at the end.  Remember, you can't point and laugh.  Only on Friday.  So you have to turn away from E-Rock and laugh at this point.  All right, we got Renee.  She brought in the Mystery Sound audio.  She's our new intern.  The first female intern we've had in many, many years.  She brought this in?  Yes, she did.  You brought in a bit?  Yes, she did.  My goodness.  Welcome to the program.  How are you?  I'm good, how are you?  How's your internship going?  It's a lot of fun.  Yeah?  I like it. 
[01:18:00]  What is your...  Everyone's great.  She just has a name tag, and it just says girl.  What a bunch of creeps we work with.  That's all we see.  Girl!  It's all right.  I don't care.  It's a girl.  What are your plans for your career as far as radio?  I don't really know yet.  Really?  I don't want to get a feel from here and then go from there.  Is it something in broadcasting, though?  Something.  Something in the industry.  In this industry.  So it could be anything.  It could be anything. 
[01:18:30]  Just as long as I like what I'm doing and I'm having fun, pretty much.  Oh.  Wow.  Well, that can mean a lot of things.  That won't happen in this business.  By the time you're ready to work, forget about it.  Who knows how awful this business will be.  Do you want to be an on-air personality, or would you prefer to be like a producer or that  thing?  More of a producer in the background type of thing.  I was thinking about going into voiceovers, but you never know.  Voiceovers.  Do you do any cartoony voices or anything?  Pretty much just television type things.  I can't really do any voices, but... 
[01:19:00]  No, you don't do like cartoons.  No.  You can do like...  You've got a nice voice, though.  Oh, thank you.  It's not bad at all.  Let me ask you a question.  Yes.  You want to be a producer, so you obviously watched the way this show is run.  Right.  Well, if you could tell Steve something that you think that he does terribly or could probably  do a little bit better or that was lacking.  Is there anything you might want to tell Steve?  Heterosexuality?  It's the way he pretends to look at my breasts and like them.  It just doesn't wash.  Because he looks at it and goes, yummy.  It's unbelievable. 
[01:19:30]  He's over the top guy who likes breasts.  Wowie.  That's not real.  Wow, guys.  Aren't these nice?  They're actually artists, Steve.  Steve, we just don't talk like that.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Yes, he sees the girl.  He tries to be hip with the guys.  He goes, hubba, hubba.  23 skidoo.  I like yummy the best.  Yummy.  Yummy.  Yummy.  Yummy.  What's wrong with you?  So are there any suggestions you would give or things that you would have done a little  bit differently?  Oh, man. 
[01:20:00]  There's a...  Right now, I'm liking how everything's run.  I'm not going to say anything bad about it because I enjoy everything right now.  Okay.  Oh, good.  But you have noticed there's problems with the organization, haven't you?  The organization.  Disorganization.  Just the organization.  Yeah, I've noticed some people probably work a little harder than others.  Some slack a little bit.  Some are smarter than others, right?  Yeah.  What's your observations?  You don't have to use names.  Oh, man.  You're putting on the spot.  No, you don't have to use names or anything.  You're talking to the top dogs in the organization, though. 
[01:20:30]  You can't get fired for this.  Do you understand?  Yeah.  You know how many people out there would love this opportunity?  Oh, man.  You do not get fired for your observations.  But have you noticed some people probably smarter than others?  Yes.  A little better suited for this business than others.  Yes.  Who's the smartest?  That's a compliment to whoever it is, right?  Yeah.  Who's the smartest around here?  Oh, man.  Hmm.  Hmm.  You guys?  Ah.  Very good.  Very smart.  Horns number one?  All right.  Here we go.  Now, behind the scenes. 
[01:21:00]  That's what we're really going to get into.  All right.  We're going to go with Steve, Than.  Are the smart ones?  In that order?  Steve first and then Than?  I don't like the fact she's going in executive order.  Yeah.  Who's, like, calling it in?  Who's the guy that's just here collecting a paycheck hoping no one notices?  E-Rock.  I'm just kidding.  It's E-Rock.  Oh, my God. 
[01:21:30]  Do you have a real answer?  He's calling it in, all right?  An order to the pizza place.  He lost weight.  He looks good.  He does.  I think he looks great.  I do absolutely nothing around here.  That's right.  Anyway.  No.  Do you have a real answer?  Um, no.  I think everyone's doing a great job.  Boring.  I know.  I'm horrible.  Yeah.  Who would you say is, um, who would you say is the weak link?  If someone had to be cut loose.  Oh, no.  If someone had to be cut loose.  Let's put it this way. 
[01:22:00]  Uh, maybe we hire you.  Who do you think, uh, should go?  Hmm.  That's a good one.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Look at all that dumb face.  She's looking behind the glass.  I'm looking around.  Looking, um, looking behind the glass.  Danny's just glaring at me.  That's just Danny.  That's his sexy look.  All right.  I'm going to, I'm going to have to face.  That's his bedroom eyes.  That's his hangover face.  Don't worry about it.  Sam.  Oh. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, Sam.  That's true.  What the hell does he do besides hold that camera?  I don't know.  You're like a creepy little Zapruder.  I just have a camera.  Yeah.  This is the second intern in this class who's trying to take away my job.  What are these people doing?  What is your job?  I'm an associate producer for the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, okay.  By the way, we all went out on Friday.  I haven't forgotten, Sam.  We'll get to it another day.  Oh.  We got to get into his eating habits.  He has the diet of an eight-year-old.  And the body of ones. 
[01:23:00]  No joke.  Hey, does your hair get lighter in the sun?  No, I cut it.  Oh, you cut it?  Yeah, it's shorter.  Okay.  It just looks lighter.  Remind me to talk about his eight-year-old diet.  All right.  We don't have time right now.  A little happy meal is good.  Oh, there you go.  There's his lunch.  This is it right there.  You thought I was lying?  You thought I was lying?  Oh, my God.  It's not that big a deal.  He's got peanut butter and jelly.  Did your mommy make that for you?  No, his girlfriend.  Oh, my God.  If that's actually right.  If the girlfriend treats him like he's going to, like, seventh grade. 
[01:23:30]  No, not even seventh grade.  That is the creepiest thing I've ever seen.  If that is a peanut butter and jelly sandwich cut into four sections, there's a major problem.  There's no jelly on that sandwich.  There's a major problem.  He doesn't like jelly.  He's very particular about what he eats.  It's a peanut butter sandwich cut into four little squares.  And then behind it in the bag is three little Oreo cookies.  Well, they're not little.  They're double stuff.  Oh.  Can I see that?  I don't believe that that is what that is.  I don't buy it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  Absolutely.  That is the worst sandwich.  What type?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why cut it?  Okay, there goes my lunch.  It's still in the bag.  It's just squashed.  Jimmy just stomped right on it.  There's his four little squares all smushed.  But I earned that sandwich.  That's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.  Let's get it out of here.  Very good.  You are a creep.  I did Sam a favor. 
[01:24:30]  He doesn't want that clap.  I'm talking about him.  All right.  Sam, we're bringing that in.  Thank you.  Let's see.  What did we learn on Friday?  I'm trying to remember everything.  He likes, what do you like?  Fish sticks.  Chicken fingers.  Chicken fingers.  Mm-hmm.  And he eats raw potatoes.  Yes.  Do you like, do you like.  He doesn't like vegetables.  He doesn't like drinking water.  He just drinks soda.  Do you get a little bowl full of Cheerios and put them in your mouth during the day?  No.  I'm not an infant.  He has the diet of an eight-year-old.  He likes little fun packs and like little cereal. 
[01:25:00]  Juicy.  Do you have a little juicy thing with a straw that you poke into it?  He eats ice cream sandwiches.  What is your favorite cereal again?  Um, I would say probably Fruity Pebbles would be my favorite cereal.  Probably right now.  I'd lean that way.  Ew.  Fruity Pebbles.  Oh, his girlfriend.  This makes the milk all fruity.  His girlfriend on Friday threw him under the bus, man.  What else?  Like mac and cheese?  No, I don't eat mac and cheese.  Sam eats what everybody wants to eat. 
[01:25:30]  Mac and cheese.  What were some of the other stuff?  Who else was there?  I'm trying to remember all the things.  He just eats pizza and chicken fingers.  That's pretty much it.  Pizza and chicken fingers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No vegetables, right?  Nothing healthy.  No, I wore raw carrots.  Raw carrots?  Yeah.  And soda for breakfast.  Soda for breakfast, yeah.  They're a Bono impersonator.  Sorry to break this up, but Bono impersonator is now on the news.  No, it's a Jeff Ross show on ABC.  Oh, Jeff Ross.  With Elon Gold, and they're like the best impressions in the contract.  Oh, really?  Pretty good, yeah.  Well, that's the Bono dude that we had.  Yeah.  That we had. 
[01:26:00]  My brother brought him in.  Fooling everybody.  He couldn't sing like Bono, but he sure looks like him.  Yeah.  All right, well, we'll get into Sam's diet.  Wow, Sam's got that.  Renee, you got the mystery sound, huh?  Yes.  You brought that in today?  Yeah, I thought it was pretty cool.  Yeah, we don't.  We're not ready to give the answer.  We actually brought you in here because we want you to do something for us.  Okay.  After the break, we bring in Big A.  Big A.  You know Big A?  I do.  Yeah.  You like Big A?  Sure.  Did you listen to this drivel before you got a job with us? 
[01:26:30]  Yes.  You did?  Oh, okay.  You know, when you ask a girl if they like someone and their answer is, sure, that's never  good.  That means I'm disgusted by this person.  Well, you know, it depends on, I mean, like, like, or, you know, like, hey, how are you?  So you wouldn't date Big A, right?  No.  For what reason?  He's a nice guy.  Not my type.  He's very lovable.  Not your type?  Not my type.  Why isn't he your type?  What's your type?  No, no, that's too easy.  You're letting it off the hook here. 
[01:27:00]  Why isn't he your type?  Yeah.  Good one.  You're right.  A little out of my age range.  Yeah.  That's it?  So if he was younger, you'd have no problem?  No.  Younger Big A?  Big A, just Big A being himself, and that's self-explanatory.  No, I don't know what you mean.  What do you mean?  I like Andrew.  I think he's an honest guy.  You know, this is an audition.  One of these dopes is going to screw up and we're going to have to fire him.  We're going to need someone to replace them. 
[01:27:30]  So this, you know, this is like, I mean, if you show some balls, I'll tell you, young Sam  back in the day when he wasn't hired, showed up, tremendous balls, and he now works for  us.  All right.  I'll do the best I can.  So what's the deal with Big A?  I'm not really attracted to him.  Why?  Oh, no.  It's not, oh God, I'm going to look so bad doing it.  No, you're not. 
[01:28:00]  No, you're not.  No.  You'll just look like every other female out there.  It's fine.  Let's get it over with.  Just get it over with and break his little heart.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Break his.  It's the weight thing.  I got to say.  It's the weight thing?  A little chubby.  Got to have something to grab onto.  Personally, for me, that's great, but a little too much.  But you don't want, like, have to use an extension just to get your arms completely around him,  right?  Eh, there you go.  You said it.  Pretty much.  So you don't like fat guys? 
[01:28:30]  I like chubby.  What's wrong with fat guys?  I like chubby guys.  There's a lot of fat guys that listen to us.  You like chubby guys?  Yeah.  Got to have something to grab onto.  Are you your dad chubby?  Do you like people around your dad?  Or is that like...  No, my dad's not.  No.  My dad's, uh...  He's all right.  No one's really...  He's not going to start talking about how hot her dad is.  No, my dad's awesome.  My dad's awesome.  But that's not a hot thing.  A lot of people emulate, like, a lot of guys like strong women because their mother's strong.  Right.  You know, whatever.  Girls like certain guys that like their dads.  Right.  It's normal.  All right, listen. 
[01:29:00]  We got Jimmy Fallon next.  We got Renee next.  More with Renee.  And Big A next.  Yes.  And we're going to figure it all out after the break.  Great.  It could be a doozy.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I got to go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony Wow Line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWME-05.  That's 866-WOWME-05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air. 
[01:29:30]  Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  9-2-3-K-Rub.  All right, the show's moving really, really fast right now.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got Carla from Boston.  She wants in real fast.  Carla, what's up?  What's up?  Hey.  The only difference between Sam's lunch and my kid's lunch is that I added an apple in there today.  Aw, an apple.  I'm telling you, Sam eats like an 8-year-old. 
[01:30:00]  His peanut butter sandwich was cut into fours today.  He had Oreo cookies in there.  I don't even have a duck sandwich into fours anymore.  No.  And then he was mad because we were in here talking about Dunkaroos.  And other little snacks that he likes.  Snacks.  What was the snack he admitted to during the break?  Gushers.  Gushers.  He eats Gushers.  Gushers?  Yeah.  That sounds like a porn line.  Oh.  All right, we're going in for the Gushers shot. 
[01:30:30]  I want a tight camera in on this one.  We need Best Boy going in for the Gushers.  Gushers.  All right, Carl.  Thank you.  Yeah, a lot of women.  And Lunchables.  Lunchables.  A lot of women.  Apparently, Travis likes Lunchables also.  A lot of women out there understanding.  This is how they send their kids.  That's cool.  Send their kids off like this.  Your girlfriend sends you off to work like you're an eight-year-old.  She just wants to make sure I eat.  Doesn't she realize you work for Shark Talks?  Shark Talks.  She cut it into four little perfect squares. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, why the four pieces?  Because I eat it when I'm driving home.  And so I don't want to.  You've got to have just a little thing.  It's just two bites.  Yeah, but I would even say cut in half is fine for that.  And you don't even need it to be cut in half to eat with one ham.  Believe me.  I'd eat like a frigging egg sandwich, two eggs, ham, cheese, while I'm driving my work  van and just have it slobbering out of this thing.  And you eat that way.  You don't need it in four little cubes. 
[01:31:30]  She wants to make sure I drive safely while I eat.  Oh, that's so awful.  With your G.I. Joe Great American Hero Lunchbox?  And here I do.  Yeah, he's got that going for him, too.  All right, so we've got that going on.  We have Renee, our new intern.  And, man, we went to break, and Pat Duffy comes marching in here.  Oh, in a huff.  In a huff.  Pat Huffy.  Hey, Pat.  That's what I was calling him. 
[01:32:00]  Grab that mic and reenact what you did during the break, please.  I called Renee out on lying over the fact that she said she heard the show before she started  interning here, which is a bold-faced lie.  Bold-faced lie.  Wow, that's worse than a regular lie.  Yeah, that's right.  I don't even know what that is.  So you've never heard the show before?  No, I have.  I have.  Yeah.  On occasion, to be honest with you, on occasion, yes.  Yeah.  No, he is BS.  You are a big fan of the...  Language.  Z100 Morning Zoo Show.  Yeah.  I listen to both.  I'm going to be honest. 
[01:32:30]  I listen to both.  Why would you listen to them?  I don't even know who does the show anymore.  What would cause you to tune from one to the other?  Like, could Z100 be doing something like that?  That's too adorable, and then we're just going to...  Too adorable.  Too disgusting.  Too despicable.  That's absolutely right.  Why not go to both?  I like everything.  You'd need common ground.  Yeah.  You'd need, like, a middle ground there.  Yeah.  All right.  What's your favorite Opian Anthony bit?  Oh, gosh.  Please enlighten us.  Oh, Patrick Duffy throwing in a barb.  I need to chime in, Patrick. 
[01:33:00]  Sorry.  No, you're right.  What, are you going to pull our hair next, you fifth grader?  I'd love to.  All right.  Let's go, man.  Creepy.  He didn't even...  Yeah, he wasn't even joking.  I'd love to.  Flinch.  So what's your favorite Opian Anthony bit?  I would probably have...  And if you name something that happened the last three weeks, we're going to have a real  problem.  And if you name something that happened since we started before school, you're also in  trouble.  And you can't mention Baby Bird.  No, I won't mention Baby Bird.  Good.  Probably...  Sex for Sam?  Yeah? 
[01:33:30]  No?  Oh, my God.  E-Rock, you want in?  Go ahead.  E-Rock threw his arms in the air.  E-Rock's going to fire a salvo now.  See, E-Rock, this could be fun.  See?  Now, go.  It's only the most famous thing that they're known for.  Known thing, yes.  I think maybe the press wrote up a little something about it.  There are people that don't even speak English that know about that bit.  That was the worst lambasting I've ever heard of.  I know.  It's bad.  The press even wrote about that.  Eric, he's no killer instinct. 
[01:34:00]  He's too nice.  You don't come in here and talk about sex for Sam like that.  We want you to go in for the kill.  Sex for Sam.  I know.  This is bad.  Name a Z100 bit.  God.  Where do I begin?  Yeah, I know.  I get it.  We stink.  We understand.  You're just using us to further yourself in broadcast.  We know.  We've seen many of you.  Don't worry about it.  What was that?  How old a gal are you?  I'm 23.  Growing up, I mean, that's probably more. 
[01:34:30]  That's fine, but don't say you listen to the show if you don't.  That's a good point.  If she's saying sex for Sam, she doesn't listen to the gal.  Is that true?  New guy.  Hey, new guy.  Who the hell are you?  Hey, you.  It's Cameron from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  I love the name tags these new guys get.  This guy just says new guy.  She says, her name tag just says girl.  This is like lost.  Like, all of a sudden, an extra becomes somebody.  Yeah.  And hopefully, within an hour, they're dead.  What's up, new guy?  Not much. 
[01:35:00]  How's it going?  Good.  Good.  That's a very comfortable standing position.  Wow.  Yes.  So, where do you come from?  Long Island.  All right.  What town?  Whereabouts?  I'm in Kings Park now.  I moved from Albertson about a year ago.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Never hear of him.  Oh.  All right.  Thanks, new guy.  Cool.  Kings Park, you got the psychiatric center right there, huh?  I don't know.  I just moved there, so.  Hey, sorry for asking.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I don't know.  Maybe you live in the psychiatric center.  Are we bothering you?  Yeah.  Are we annoying you? 
[01:35:30]  Jesus.  I'm trying to just do a job here.  Could you guys shut up and leave me alone?  All right.  I don't like him because he doesn't move at all when he talks.  No.  His body is perfectly still and his mouth just moves.  It's one of those things on Conan where they, like, put the lips in.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  We got Big A in studio.  What's up, Big A?  We'll get to you eventually, new guy.  Big A.  Oh, boy.  Nothing much, really.  Can I compliment, Andrew?  He smoked today on whatever cologne it is.  I guess Dracar Noir, but I think I'm wrong.  What is it?  Oh, chrome.  What? 
[01:36:00]  I actually have it.  I have chrome at home.  What is chrome?  It's a good cologne.  He smells a lot like it was a chrome is a cologne.  He smells like it.  Renee, go smell Big A in the naughty area.  Let's go.  Naughty area.  Where?  You have to bring the mic.  Yeah, just give him a sniff.  Nah, she could.  Just get over there and sniff him.  Where's the cologne?  Neck.  Is it nice?  Yeah.  It's all right.  Not bad.  What's wrong with his cologne?  No, no.  It's good.  Can't you find one thing you like about the guy?  He's right in front of you. 
[01:36:30]  It smells good.  It smells good.  Yeah.  Chrome, huh?  It smells good.  Boy, did Eric just capture her soul in this photo.  He captured her soul.  What did he do?  He took a picture of Renee.  She was smelling Big A.  Yeah, that's a good face.  Grabbed her soul.  And Big A's eyes are like just hoping that there might be something finally.  Some kind of attraction.  Big A, I'm saying Big A, you showered this morning. 
[01:37:00]  Because his hair is not greasy.  Your hair is very well kept there.  You got a nice, you're combed.  He's got a new t-shirt on.  He's got new pants.  And let me tell you something.  And this is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays A.P. on the Opie and Anthony.  Rarely comes out.  What did I say to you in the hallway there, Big A?  Get out of my effing way.  I'm more important than you'll ever be.  Not now.  On air only.  On air only.  We only make believe we know each other on the air. 
[01:37:30]  I told Big A, it looks like you lost a few LBs there.  Ah.  Got a ways to go, though.  We'll be honest here.  I'm trying.  But it looks like you dropped a few.  I think we should get a competition.  We get Pat from Menachie and Big A, the all-out weight loss battle.  That would be a biggie.  We could get everyone voting.  We could have Team Big A and Team Pat from Menachie, t-shirts and everything.  We could do that.  We could have a whole festival and see who could lose the most weight this summer or something.  Maybe we'll get with Dr. Ian Smith. 
[01:38:00]  I like it.  Because the E-Rock pad is now just boring.  No, because now he's losing weight.  Yeah, it's like.  Who cares?  I know one of these idiots won't lose a pound.  It'll make it beautiful for us.  One of these idiots is right in the room.  Oh, sorry, Big A.  That's Opie.  You know, he's a dick.  What do you think of Girl?  Yeah, what do you think of Girl?  She's very beautiful.  Aw, thank you.  And why don't you return the compliment, will you? 
[01:38:30]  You're cute, too, Big A.  You're adorable.  Oh, that's.  You hear the way she said it?  It was like.  That wasn't like that real.  If I was Big A, I'd rather be called ugly than hear that crap.  Oh, I'm sorry.  All right.  Can I say it again?  Yeah.  You're cute.  You're adorable.  Oh, that.  All right, that still didn't work out.  Yeah, you can't even fake that.  You sound like Hillary Clinton endorsing Bush. 
[01:39:00]  Wow.  They can hear that out there.  Yeah.  So, Big A, what have you been up to?  Things good?  Just working.  Nothing much.  Yeah, still driving that cab, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a tough gig.  Tough job.  Not easy, no.  Got your ass in a seat all them hours.  Yep.  Probably got, what, roid problems a little bit. 
[01:39:30]  A little bit.  Not really.  Sometimes a little burning.  Like Jimmy says, vinegar, oil and vinegar, potato chip.  His ass looks like a bunch of bats are hanging in a cave.  Hey, Fast Freddy's usually really, really, really sharp.  But on the instant feedback, he writes,  Hey, Greg, there's no voting in a weight loss contest.  Well, voting for who's going to lose the most weight?  Yeah, you could, well, choose.  Choose, whatever.  All right.  Tell him to shut up. 
[01:40:00]  Maybe you're right, Fast Freddy.  All right.  So, Big A, you know, lately on the show, we've been bringing in some of our guys to just kind  of reintroduce them to the audience and making sure everyone out there, you know, knows a  little bit about you guys.  Okay?  Okay.  So, we're thinking maybe Renee could interview you today.  Okay.  Renee?  Sure.  We actually prepared your questions.  Yeah, we got questions for you.  Oh, okay.  We did all the heavy lifting for you.  Oh, thanks.  We know you're a girl. 
[01:40:30]  Jeez.  Yeah, it's all right.  I wonder we've never had girl interns.  Yeah, well.  Actually, Fan and the gang got questions for you.  Is that cool?  That's fine.  You know, because I, you know, I think it'd be nice to see you interview Big A.  All right.  Kind of does two things, you know, shows your interviewing skills, helps you out, I guess,  a little bit as far as broadcasting goes.  And it reintroduces Big A to our audience.  Yes, a lot of the newer markets.  There's some of the questions.  Yeah, you know.  You got the questions for you.  Fire when ready? 
[01:41:00]  Well, there might be just a little twist.  It's a new segment we have.  Bring in the helmets.  Oh, no.  Yeah, why not?  It's harmless.  Wow, good work.  Oh, wow.  They went back into the lab and really figured the helmets out.  Phase two.  Big A, do you know this bit yet?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think that's why he's got the cologne on and that he showered, right?  He smells good, man.  You prepared for this. 
[01:41:30]  You had a feeling, didn't you?  He's a smart guy.  Yeah, he's definitely going to need a bigger helmet.  He might look a little strange, but he's no dummy.  No, he's not a dummy.  I'm sorry, Big A.  That was open.  Slap him.  Well, we have to put the helmets on.  All right, strap that on.  For the new listeners, this is the uncomfortably close interview with Renee, the girl intern,  the first one we've had in many years.  Andrew looks, you've never seen a bigger psychopath than he looks like with that helmet on.  Don't you know what he looks like? 
[01:42:00]  For all the pet lovers out there, when you try to put something on your pet and the pet  is just miserable.  The pet doesn't like it like a second before he scrapes it off his head.  Right.  Big A's, Big A, why the crazy eyes?  What happened?  Yeah, you got like your eyebrows are all down like you're angry.  Wait, what happened, Big A?  Are you all right?  I think it's just the weight of the helmet.  Big A, what's going on?  Um, yeah, I'm all right.  You all right?  Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.  You going to be all right?  Yeah.  See, this is, it's two bicycling helmets.  Yeah.  And they are connected together just face to face. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  So now, the participants in the interview.  Hey, don't break Danny's hard work, Renee.  Danny's hard work.  I'm trying to, you know what, I have to.  Yeah, you guys better sit down, maybe.  Get two chairs or something.  All right, sit down.  Can I say the woman at the end of Sixth Sense was happier in her biking helmet?  She's going to be.  All right, wow.  Okay.  I need questions.  Hold on.  Wait, you guys, you guys set this up better.  Because Big A's a big boy.  He's very tall. 
[01:43:00]  Renee's not short, but Big A's a lot taller.  Yeah.  And there goes the helmet.  You got to lift your head a little more so you're absolutely both facing each other.  Yeah, how are they able to kind of pull their heads away when these helmets are like touching?  Because Danny made it.  Hey, you didn't put the chin strap on.  She broke it.  Renee.  All right, Danny, you know what you got to do?  You need another bar now.  A lower bar.  On the side, right?  Yeah, yeah.  We're still working out the details.  At the Institute.  Of the uncomfortably close interview.  We got Pal Talk set up for this? 
[01:43:30]  Can they see?  All right.  We got one?  Hold on.  Hold on.  We got to get the Pal Talk.  The chin strap's got to be on.  Get the chin strap on.  Renee, your chin strap.  Because it's what you're used for your...  Sam just did the worst tape job ever, by the way.  He just threw a piece of tape on it.  They are now a mere five inches away from each other.  Their eyes are really close.  Why don't you just stick it together with some gummy bears?  You infant.  Okay.  Wait, wait.  Renee, look at Big A.  What do you see?  I can't.  Hold on.  Lift that helmet up.  Like, re-bend it. 
[01:44:00]  Okay.  There.  Am I good?  Oh, they're a little...  All right.  I bet that's horrific, just being...  Big A, how are you feeling?  I'm all right.  Uncalled.  Oh, he's nervous.  Why are you nervous, Big A?  What's the matter?  You've never been this close to a girl?  You don't like having a pretty girl that close to you?  Yeah, Renee's pretty, by the way.  She's all right.  She's very pretty.  Yeah.  Thank you.  We forgot to describe you for the radio audience.  She's got a nice body.  Pretty face.  Well, I think you could have just said pretty girl and, you know, leave it at that. 
[01:44:30]  You've got to start going into her.  And an uncomfortably large mole on her face.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Where's her mole?  I didn't see a mole.  There is no mole.  I hope he's just theater of the mind.  No, I'm not mole-y.  What size shoe do you have?  This is going to sound bad.  I'm actually...  Well, since I'm 5'8", I wear a size 10.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  It looks like...  I thought it was more of an 8. 
[01:45:00]  No.  Why aren't they looking at...  Renee, why will...  Well, you do not look at Big A's eyes.  I'm trying to read the questions and the helmet.  I don't want to break the helmet again, so I'm trying to...  Danny, are you happy with how they're situated?  Well, she kind of...  You want her sitting on...  Maybe get her on a...  Here, grab those pillows over there.  Prop her up a little higher.  You can't blame her, Danny.  Obviously, your craftsmanship sucks.  Renee, it's so awful.  What's up?  Lift that butt of yours.  There you go.  All right, sit on that.  Oh, that's better.  All right. 
[01:45:30]  Sit on that.  It's a couple of pillows.  Now, all right, you can read the question, but then you have to look into Big A's eyes  as you're uncomfortably close and listen for his answer, okay?  Sounds good.  All right.  Here's Renee, the girl intern.  Did you have a happy childhood?  Yes, I did.  Okay.  What was her happy about?  Um, I did love traveling, um, trips to Florida, to Israel. 
[01:46:00]  Same thing.  Israel.  It was real.  Very good.  His family tried to make me a suicide bomber.  I'm sure you love those trips.  How old were you when you had your first homosexual experience?  What?  Hey, I'm just reading the question.  Well, look in his eyes and get the answer.  Let's go.  Yeah, the helmet's kind of going through that.  Yeah, the helmet's tilting down.  That is annoying the hell out of me. 
[01:46:30]  Your first homosexual experience?  How old?  Never, because I've never had one.  Really?  That's surprising.  Not even as a goof?  Yeah, it's coming off.  Yeah.  Just tape it to his head.  Not even for a ride?  They're taping the helmet to Big A's head.  His chin strap doesn't fit across his chin.  So, Dan's using tape.  That's going to hurt on the whiskers.  Are you good?  They're just duct taping them now. 
[01:47:00]  This looks ridiculous.  Yeah, I know this is more of a visual, but you've got to just picture bicycle helmets  that are pretty much attached to each other.  They're like four or five inches away from each other, and now they're taping the helmet  so it fits better on the freaking.  Big A.  Travis is bringing in two things of copy paper.  She needs a booster seat.  What?  Okay.  Next.  We're good.  Tell us something about yourself that nobody else knows.  Ooh.  I like that question.  Don't look at us, Big A. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, look in her eyes.  Face to face.  Renee, look in his eyes.  She can't.  The helmets keep popping up.  She totally broke it now.  I totally just broke the helmets.  Because I'm trying to lift it to look in his eyes.  Yeah, she's trying to do the right thing.  Don't make us, like, squeeze you together like we did Jared and...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What?  I hope not.  You could sit on...  No, I'm actually...  I'm trying to look in his eyes, but the bicycle helmet keeps falling down.  Is there a way to just touch the brims of the helmets together?  Just clunk?  Just kind of...  Don't make Kenny get involved. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, you don't want Kenny to help.  Oh, no.  Kenny's the worst.  Kendall goes...  Oh, no.  Oh, Danny's hard work.  Look how bummed he is.  Hard work.  Danny took 10 minutes with some tape and a stick.  All right.  That was awful.  All right.  All right.  They're back very close.  The uncomfortably close interview continues with Big A.  Yeah.  All right.  What do you secretly do in private?  I know.  Dad, we know you want to tell us.  Now it's just an interview with two people wearing two stupid helmets. 
[01:48:30]  It makes no sense once the bond is broke.  Go ahead.  What do you think you could do in private?  Yeah, let's tie them together.  All right.  Listen, we got to do this right.  Just get that...  Bring in the rope.  The duct tape's not working.  No, we got rope.  We're tying them together.  Jesus.  We're going to do the uncomfortably close interview with Renee and Big A after the break.  Is Jimmy Fallon here?  Yes.  Oh, good.  Oh, boy.  He's going to love this, I think. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  We got Jimmy Fallon next as well.  I'll hold on.  You just stay just like that, Big A.  Just...  Yeah.  I want Jimmy Fallon to see that.  Please meet him like that.  Yeah.  Guy's a big star.  With no explanation.  Yeah.  Hey, don't point at life.  That's only for Fridays.  Point at life, Friday.  All right.  All right.  We're going to tie you guys together.  We have to.  I'm sorry.  I'm really sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[01:49:30]  The uncomfortably close interview continues after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony just got me wowed.  I just got wowed.  We tell you how to get a wow sticker, but we can't plug the website.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  Oh, we got so much going on.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jimmy Fallon has entered the studio.  What's up, guys? 
[01:50:00]  We were just talking about his SNL bit where he makes fun of all the morning zoos.  And we're back here, ladies and gentlemen.  Anyway, it's 6 to the hour, and I just got my prostate checked the other day.  My doctor made it.  Yeah, he put two fingers up there.  That doesn't seem right.  Anyway, 4 to the hour.  It's almost 5 in the morning.  We'll be right back here with the Z.  Ow.  That had to hurt.  Give me some dopey sound effects in there.  Wow, what happened then?  Exactly.  That's where I found her. 
[01:50:30]  She's totally cheating on me.  She's cheating on me with T-Vode Food Network.  I mean, I don't know what she's doing.  Hey, here's Jimmy at the Proctologist.  Let's make him that sound.  It's completely hilarious.  Let's cut to the racist weatherman.  I don't like white people.  It's going to be cold in the room.  I was only joking.  Yeah, all right.  Stoner Joey's here with traffic.  And I don't think I'm going to leave the house today.  Stoner Joey.  It's 5 to the hour. 
[01:51:00]  We'll be right back, 6 in the morning here at the Z.  I would sit and watch that, and I would be depressed.  I'd watch it, and I'd be laughing, but going,  that's like the business I'm really in now.  We're part of that business, man.  Jim Norton, you must know from going through stand-up things,  you have to do it before you do your stand-up act.  I mean, you do the morning radio.  Oh, it's awful, dude.  It's like 6 in the morning, and they want to joke around  and be all about sex, and you're so not into it.  Well, they're like, where do you want to go?  Do you got any topics? 
[01:51:30]  That's what they're lazy.  They want you to just do your material.  You're like, no, let's just talk.  Whatever you guys are doing, I'll jump in.  Yeah, you want me to do my material that I'm going to do on stage tonight?  That's going to be fun for people.  Hey, you guys like a repeat?  I want to just say, hey, Jimmy Fallon's on the show, and go.  Yeah, and then entertain us for 10 minutes before we hit the commercial break.  Well, then they can also do it, and they go like, hey, thanks for coming by.  Big fan, Jim, you're awesome.  We'll be right on in two seconds.  And they're like, and we're here.  So what was Taxi all about?  That movie was terrible.  Why would you do something?  I mean, it wasn't funny at all. 
[01:52:00]  Just give it up in your career, or what?  Big fan of all your work.  Big fan, we're going to start in about 20 seconds here.  You need some water or coffee or anything you need?  Oh, we love you.  Here's Jimmy Fallon.  Wow, what a piece of crap movie that's actually was.  How the hell did you even do that?  You might as well just take a dub in a DVD box and give it to my wife.  I mean, that was unbelievably bad.  And it's just like, where were the guys I was just talking to?  They were friendly people.  Invited me to the Hamptons for a barbecue like three minutes ago. 
[01:52:30]  The best is when they get mad using that voice.  It's like, what are you doing?  No one gets mad like that.  Hey, I'm steamed.  I'm steamed.  Don't tell you, Jimmy Fallon.  The network doesn't even know what the heck is going to go out of here.  I can't even say the H-E-double-L word, but you know what I'm talking about.  And I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I'll tell management where they could go.  Let's play the Johnny Paycheck song.  Take this job and shove it.  I'm not afraid.  Spring.  All right.  Somebody's getting a rise in his Levi's. 
[01:53:00]  Where's my boner sound effect?  The universal sound of the boner or the slinking.  It is a despicable, awful business.  It's a tricky thing because it's like you kind of need them to sell your crap in the morning.  Your crappy movies.  But yeah.  Your crappy movies.  One or the other.  And then you get this.  I was just joking.  I'm just kidding.  It really was a bad movie.  I mean, why would you do something like that?  But I mean, I need to say it's like, so you get a lot of Munaki?  Because I'm not allowed to say S-E-X on the air. 
[01:53:30]  So let me just make up a crazy word for sex.  You're like, what are we, children?  Munaki?  I guess.  Yeah, I guess.  I guess I got a lot of Munaki.  What is it so bizarre?  It's an awful business full of awful people.  Does she ever slurp the gourd?  You know what I'm talking about.  I don't.  I really don't.  What does that mean?  Going into quadruple entendre here, sir.  I can't really understand you.  And then they're just laughing, but they're not even listening.  But they're, I just, I got to laugh at this. 
[01:54:00]  I'm looking around the studio for the next thing I got to do.  But hell, you're funny.  Terrence, the thought there's a second of dead air or, you know, a time to breathe.  Yeah.  It would get like, you know, yeah.  So what we do here, Jimmy, is throw you in the middle of something.  We're in the middle of this uncomfortably close interview.  Well, I just walked in.  I was like, okay, I've been to that club before.  You're tied up now because.  Strapped up to a portly gentleman.  And Danny's very proud because he came up with the apparatus. 
[01:54:30]  Right, Danny?  You were very happy.  I worked on it for a long time yesterday.  And they busted the apparatus.  A bicycle helmet with a camera on.  It's awesome, though.  And so now we decided that we just got to tie him together with rope.  You didn't see a morning show do this before, I hope.  No, no, no.  Well, I mean, but she's a very pretty girl.  Are you excited about this?  Thank you.  No, not you.  I mean him.  No, it sucks.  Big A's belly is ruining the bit still.  It's supposed to be the uncomfortably close interview, but with the belly, she can't get 
[01:55:00]  that close.  She's arched over forward.  She's arched over like a dresser or something.  One of those beach balls they use at the gym.  It may be ruining the bit.  You should see what it's doing to his life.  Her back is hurting her now.  It's like, I can't lean over his belly anymore.  He really is rarely this close to a girl.  When was the last time you were with the girl there, Big A?  A long time ago.  Is it weird that she's not screaming?  She can't dial 911 from that close. 
[01:55:30]  With a cell phone.  Well, we got him tied up now and duct tape and they're holding.  Well, she's like, her arms are taped around him at this point.  Right?  And now she's going to interview, ask him questions or?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They got to be completely face to face though.  But see, Big A prepared.  Big A prepared though because he took a shower, he put cologne on, he got a new shirt.  Okay.  Usually he's unkempt.  He's a cab driver, so he's always, you know, he's working.  Ask him where he, you're a New Yorker, right?  Well, I have a question for cab drivers. 
[01:56:00]  I mean, is this true?  I heard a rumor that they actually just go to the bathroom in a Tupperware thing and  put it under your seat.  Oh, yeah.  Actually, I drive a private cab and I don't do that, no.  He's rolling his eyes at me like, don't just do that.  My cab is a, no.  He said cabillard foie gras.  I'm so sorry.  I didn't know.  That's hack cabbie stuff.  I've never been in that cab before.  The one I'm in, it smells like the guy just took a dump in a Tupperware.  You don't do that.  Okay.  Guess where he drives his cab though? 
[01:56:30]  You're going to be amazed by this.  Yep.  I'm like taxi driver.  In the Bronx?  In the Bronx.  Oh, you're Bronx.  I don't know.  Independent.  He's an independent in the Bronx.  Okay.  All right.  So are you one of those black cabs or?  Actually, I work for a company up in the Bronx.  Sorry to ask you the tough questions.  I'm sorry.  I didn't want to stump you on that one.  Who do you work for?  That's right.  You can answer tomorrow.  Any questions, a tough one for Big A.  Let's just write it down and hand it over to me.  Do you live in the Bronx? 
[01:57:00]  Yes, I do.  Okay, cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not looking at him, Rene.  This is not what I'm comfortable with.  Hey, Big A, how's the breath today?  Good?  Good.  Rene, how's the breath?  It's all right.  Not bad.  We should give him something, like a nice blue cheese sandwich.  Puffy.  Is it a gorgonzola latte?  Well, I think you cleaned out your mouth nice, right?  You knew this was happening today.  Did you go?  Yeah.  I flossed.  He usually has a... 
[01:57:30]  He's still getting a little nervous, like white stuff in the corner.  I think it's just because you got a girl so close to you.  He's starting to foam with the mouth.  Yeah, he's frothing.  He's sweating a little under the helmet.  It happens.  It's hot in here.  It's hot in here.  All right, why don't you ask the last few questions, then we got to talk to a big star here.  All right.  See, we should have done this with Jimmy Fallon.  Okay.  Emmer Nair.  Big A.  Yeah, that would be a big A.  All right.  What are your strengths, slash weaknesses? 
[01:58:00]  Look at her.  Stop moving around.  Eye to eye.  Eye to eye.  Oh, they're really close now.  Wow.  What can I drive for?  No, come on.  What's your strengths and weaknesses?  Go ahead.  Come on.  Sorry.  That'd be fun.  Look at each other.  Look at your left.  Strengths, last weaknesses.  Hold on.  Their nose is touching.  Going backwards.  I can't.  What's happening? 
[01:58:30]  Wait, what's wrong, Renee?  I can't.  That's uncomfortable.  I can't talk.  Uh-oh.  This is what's happening.  You're choking her, Kenny.  Kenny.  She's got a chin strap on.  It's unbuckling her belt.  This is very weird.  It's got a prehensile, invisible man movie or something.  Strengths, last weaknesses.  Come on.  Um, I guess my, um, personality.  Which one is that?  Start with your strengths.  Why are you turning your head, Renee?  Because I'm trying to read the questions.  Put down the questions. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Go ahead.  All right.  Next question.  Sorry.  No, no, we got to get into that question.  What are your strengths and weaknesses?  Uh, I guess my weakness is my speech impediment and my weight.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  But it's self-deprecating.  Self-deprecating.  Boy.  Heartbreaking.  We weren't going to mention this.  Okay.  Strengths, sweetest guy in the whole world.  Yeah.  What are your strengths, Louie?  What are your strengths?  Uh, uh, that's my, uh, good sense of humor, personality. 
[01:59:30]  Sense of direction.  Something like that.  I was like, that's a good one, right?  You can try a cab driver.  Yeah.  You wouldn't even think about that one.  He's like, oh, I guess so.  Sense of humor.  You're in front of Jimmy Fallon, you know.  Man, Jimmy picked your impression up instantly, too.  That's just...  The big A.  Oh, my strengths are, um... 
[02:00:00]  God, I knew this this morning.  Oh, they are, uh...  I pack my own lunch, and, uh, I, I, uh, I know how to operate my TiVo.  All right, that was true.  Other questions?  Okay.  Oh, here we go.  How would you ask a woman out on a date?  Look at her, Andrew.  You gotta look at her, man.  Brighten her eyes.  Tenny, you could, like, hold him down a little bit.  Just don't choke out Renee.  Don't touch the girl.  Yeah. 
[02:00:30]  All right.  Look at the scary look he gives her.  All right.  The nose are just about touching her.  How would you ask me out?  Come on.  As a girl, any girl.  Renee, you're not looking at his eyes.  There you go.  Uncomptibly close interview.  Nose touching.  Could you help me get this couch in the back of my van?  I'd love them into submission.  Clarifying.  I was kind of a tough question to ask on the radio, being this close. 
[02:01:00]  Why?  Hence the bit.  Go out with me, or else.  This will only hurt a little.  I don't know.  I guess I would just, you know, ask nicely if you want to, you know, either go out or have a cup of coffee.  Okay.  Would you throw any lines out there?  Pick up lines?  You got a pick up line there?  Big A.  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  One of the good ones.  One of the classics.  Yeah, come on.  You're smooth.  Have you ever seen that one scene from Borat?  Not really.  Most of the pick up lines are hacky anyway.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey.  Hey.  Who is that?  Big A.  Hey.  You're going to fold us.  Not one of those cabs.  The hacky lines.  Yeah.  Big A.  Okay.  Okay.  So instead of saying what you would do, just ask her out.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  There you go.  Yeah.  She's single.  Throw something out there.  Wait.  It's okay.  Go ahead.  Renee, I'm going to choke you.  Can I jump in?  Steve from Bayshore.  He's now on Pal Talk.  Would you like to help me harvest my face berries?  Your what?  I don't even understand that one.  Face berries?  Face berries?  I don't know.  Is Steve on drugs today? 
[02:02:30]  Maybe he's a farmer.  I have harvest jokes.  Face berries just sounds funny.  It does.  I don't even know what the heck is.  I don't know what it is, but sure, okay.  I like it.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Wow.  Big A is looking pissed.  Yeah.  Are you pissed, Big A?  No.  You okay?  No.  All right.  So now you don't really know her.  I don't know why you'd be in this position not knowing anybody.  Got an elevator.  It's crowded.  Yeah.  There you go.  Okay.  Crowded elevator.  It's a toolie, I mean.  You don't know her, so you can't just say, hey, Renee, you want to go out? 
[02:03:00]  This is a stranger.  You've locked eyes.  Now you get this feeling like if I let her get away, I'm never going to see her again.  So this is my moment.  Let me ask her out and go.  Oh, your weight made the elevator plummet.  You're dead.  Sorry.  Oh, yeah.  Don't rush to the answer.  There's a fire in the building.  I said it.  It started a half an hour ago. 
[02:03:30]  Um, we need immediate assistance.  The worst fire alarm in the world.  He's like constantly hitting the snooze button on what he's about to say.  He's about to say something and then just hits the snooze button.  Um, not yet.  Oh, that's it.  Two more minutes.  Oh, damn.  Yeah, I'll be back with you.  I'll be back.  I'm not going to say it now.  Snooze.  Okay.  There you go.  Here's your moment. 
[02:04:00]  Do you know a Steve from the Bronx there, Big A?  Is he your boss?  Yes or no?  All right, Steve.  Steve from the Bronx.  What's up?  How you doing?  Hey.  Hi.  Big A, I just wanted to clarify one of your, um, weaknesses.  You want to clarify one of Big A's weaknesses?  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  Wait, wait.  Did he curse?  Yeah, I think he whispered.  Let me get it down the hall.  The big S-word.  Who perished the thought we hear that?  All right, we got Steve from the Bronx.  He's got, uh, a Big A, uh, weakness.  Go ahead, Steve. 
[02:04:30]  Big A.  The big weakness that you forgot to mention is you can never get to work on time.  Oh.  Always late.  Always late, huh?  When are you supposed to be there?  Uh, I give him a window between 6 and 6.30, and he comes in 7, 7.30.  Better give him a sliding glass door.  Hence the reason he's a cab driver, let's be honest here.  I mean, it's not like he's working on Wall Street.  Yeah.  Give the guy a break.  He's fired from his job at NASA for tardiness.  Are you always late for those depositions, Steve? 
[02:05:00]  Right.  I mean, what the hell?  He's got bodies to bury in the middle of the night.  Give him a break.  He's all played real quick.  55-gallon drums.  All right.  Steve, please don't fire him, because we don't want to pick up his salary just yet.  Not yet?  No, not yet.  Please.  We'll promote whatever the hell you need.  Give me two weeks notice, at least.  All right.  Thanks, Steve.  Steve from the Bronx.  All right.  We've got to wrap this up so we can talk to Jimmy Fallon.  Damn it.  Okay.  Did you do your pick-up line?  No.  No, I'm still waiting for it.  No, you're right.  Just give him the pick-up line. 
[02:05:30]  Here you go.  Look at him, right?  Madly in love.  Love at first.  Would you like to go get a cup of coffee for breakfast?  Breakfast?  I don't know about breakfast.  Maybe a cup of coffee.  All right.  Okay.  Coffee sounds good.  All right.  Want to go to an all-you-can-eat buffet?  Right.  I don't have to have four hours.  Big A.  All right.  Wow.  Wow.  Look at that.  He actually got a date.  Hold on.  You're choking me.  What does your face look like?  What is it? 
[02:06:00]  You're choking me.  You'll hear that later in the day.  You're choking me.  In his basement.  Puts the lotion on its skin.  What does her face look like?  She's in a wind tunnel at this point.  What's going on over there?  The helmet's just...  All right.  One last question.  Is there one more good question?  All right.  She's getting whiplash, pulling her head back from Big A.  How often...  Okay.  How often do you go to the dentist?  Oh.  Oh.  Who wrote that question?  Oh, boy.  Wait a minute.  Was that...  Oh.  Big A had nothing to do with the dentist. 
[02:06:30]  Who wrote that question?  He gets very sensitive about this.  What is a dentist?  It's good, aren't you?  It's Jimmy Fallon, though.  You've got to appreciate that.  I haven't even seen your teeth.  I mean, to me, I haven't even seen your teeth because you guys have been so close.  I'm just...  You appreciate humor.  Look, he's making funnies at your expense.  Jimmy's on fire today.  He really is on fire.  He's giving you a good beating.  Right.  We shouldn't even have you guys in the studio.  We didn't realize he was going to be...  I was very excited.  This is awesome. 
[02:07:00]  That's a good way to wake up in the morning.  Instead of the typical interview, we give you some little difference, Jimmy.  The way you guys know is that we actually know each other.  We tie each other up and wear bike helmets.  We do this routinely and drive around the Bronx and have champagne and caviar.  All right.  Let's get the dentist question done and we can move on.  Yes.  You've got to look right into our eyes.  Okay.  How many times do you go to the dentist?  Not too often.  Not too often?  No.  All right.  Why?  Why don't you give her a smile, Andrew?  Yeah.  There you go. 
[02:07:30]  That's the lip balm.  Penny, what's up?  Because he just pulled the...  He didn't even try to show any teeth whatsoever.  It was just completely closed mouth smile.  It's all right.  All right.  Why not the dentist?  She's nice.  She's being nice to Big A.  Kind of, yeah.  Why, sweetie?  I don't tell you.  Oh, big fella.  All right.  Big A goes to the dentist.  The dentist runs out the door like one of Marilyn's boyfriends on the Munsters. 
[02:08:00]  He just leaves a dental imprint.  An imprint of a dentist in the door.  He's had a fast motion.  That was awesome.  He calls home and he goes, let's have that addition put on the house.  Forget it.  You know that pull you've been hoping for this summer?  He just walked in.  Right.  Good God.  We could go forever with you guys.  Yeah.  Big A and Renee.  The uncomfortably close interview.  Yes, good job, you too. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  Unfasten them and let them get back to their respective lives.  Jimmy, we got to get some of this stuff out before we leave.  And we want to hear the song, too.  Car Wash for Peace?  Yeah, yeah.  We don't have to play it, but I just wanted to come on.  I wanted to do the song.  Now I'm turning it to Big A.  I wanted to do something for the troops or something like that or for something.  And I don't really know much about politics or anything like that. 
[02:09:00]  And so I just wanted to make maybe like a comedy song or some goofy song that if you download  it off iTunes, the money goes to fisherhouse.org, which is this place.  It's like a rehab for troops that come back from the war and they have missing limbs or  something like that, and they're like 17 years old, so they have their mom and dad come  in, not to bum you out.  That's a nice thing to do.  No, it's good someone's talking about this, because I was watching CNN this morning and  they're telling us the whales are almost free.  I was like, oh, wonderful.  Who cares about the whales?  What about the soldiers in Iraq? 
[02:09:30]  It's the worst month, the worst May yet.  And I couldn't think of what to do about it, so I was going to do maybe like a bake sale  for Peace.  Yeah.  That would be kind of, because I, you know.  Worked in school.  Yeah, absolutely.  So I was like, I think car watches was more, I can remember like in high school, they would  always have like the car watch for like the new football team.  And it would solve every problem.  Like every financial problem.  Yeah.  It's like, they give you bad car watches for five bucks.  Yeah.  Scratch your car up.  Completely.  And you go, whatever.  I just bought the high school new football uniform.  Right.  Have you done troop shows before? 
[02:10:00]  You have, right?  I did a long time ago, and I did Okinawa.  Vietnam?  Yeah.  Okinawa.  See, I went back.  That was pretty good.  I thought I was going to go back.  Yeah.  But you went further.  Yeah.  I went really further.  Speaking of the war, I have to bring this up.  You, now I love you on SNL, of course.  You took me out of Band of Brothers.  I wanted to smack you in the head.  Yeah.  This is more Morning Zoo stuff.  I take you, no, I take people out.  No, it's not Morning Zoo stuff.  This is off, and then you go, wait a second.  But, but, it's one of my favorite parts of Band of Brothers. 
[02:10:30]  You come pulling up in a Jeep with like a smirk on your face going, like, hey guys, need  some ammo?  Hey, dude.  And I'm like, it's Jimmy Fallon in a Jeep.  Hey, dude.  Hey, dudes.  Hey, dude's like, I got ammo.  I hear there's artillery hitting and stuff.  Dude, I, I, to be honest, I, I.  How did you get that?  Like, who offered you that?  I, I wanted to do it, because I, I was a big, a big fan of the whole, uh, Stephen Ambrose.  It's a great, great series.  And the book is awesome.  It's such an easy read.  And it's, so I was like, I knew they were making it, and I was like, I want to see if I can  get, like, just something to be in there.  And then, so I, I, I auditioned for it, and just to play Lieutenant Rice. 
[02:11:00]  And, uh, I'm there, and it's a World War II Jeep.  I don't know how to drive.  Regular.  And this is a stick shift.  So, I don't know how to drive.  So, I had to.  Is that why it looked like?  Well, my, I'm just so nervous.  And, like, my line is, like, I gotta go, like, good luck, good luck, soldiers.  And I have to just peel out, you know, take off.  But it's like, you gotta push the button, push the clutch in, turn on the light, put  it in neutral, ease off the clutch.  So, I'm like, good luck, guys.  And he's not going to me.  I'm not leaving at all.  It's like, so not cool.  It's like, the most.  And that was the best thing you could get from here. 
[02:11:30]  It was the lamest.  That was probably 20 takes.  So, Tom Hanks is directing.  He's like, all right, let's do it again, Jimmy.  This time, say your line and just press the clutch.  I'll have somebody push the G out of it.  Oh, no.  So, then I'm even more nervous because there's, like, 300 soldiers just laughing at me.  So, I go, like, all right, guys, good luck, soldiers.  And I forget to press the clutch.  And there's these two guys pushing.  Like, struggling, pushing the G.  And it's going through the mud.  He's going, God, what's going on?  My head's moving, like, this far.  It's so, like, the lamest exit. 
[02:12:00]  I was like, oh, I can't believe we had fired from Ben and Brothers.  It's so embarrassing.  So, they finally got it.  They put, like, a sound effect in.  If you watch the guy, you hear, like, vroom, vroom.  It was like, he really took off.  But, really, I was just pressing the clutch.  I've watched the scene.  I swear, it has to be 20 times.  I'm just so proud of that.  I drive through.  It's like, hey, good luck, soldiers.  Take care, guys.  And you leave.  I'm so happy.  Like, hey, Dad, look what I did.  Waiting for, like, Horatio to come push you.  Completely, absolutely. 
[02:12:30]  They're going to turn off the master computer.  I want to get this song on the air for Jimmy.  Can you come back and do, like, the whole show or something?  I'd love to.  I'm not even kidding.  Like, we have a bunch of our guys come in and just do the whole show.  I'd love to.  I'd be honored.  It's a pleasure to have me back.  And then if we ever get back over there, you can come over there and use potty mouth language.  No, see, I'm not a, I don't know.  Oh, you'll just say things like, hey.  So, I'm obsessed with your careers.  I just love it so much.  It's like, you get in so much trouble, then you finally go to satellite. 
[02:13:00]  I'm sorry.  Then you're not allowed to say, I'm like, well, Jimmy's saying it.  What the hell?  You're saying it.  I want to see this movie so bad.  I really want to see it.  Oh, I know, really.  I love your careers.  It's just awesome.  And now we're back on regular radio for a little while because you were too dirty for a satellite.  I don't know what happened, Jimmy.  I'd love to elaborate.  It's just the awesomest thing I've ever seen.  We're just hoping they'll explain it to us someday.  It's so awesome because we're trying to figure it out.  All right, Car Watch for Peace.  I'm enjoying the sleep.  Yeah, absolutely.  Car Watch for Peace is the song.  It's for a great cause.  Raises money for the Fisher House. 
[02:13:30]  Go to fisherhouse.org.  And you go to iTunes and you can download the song and the proceeds will go to the charity, right?  Yeah.  All right.  And you're going to come back and see us soon.  Absolutely.  A lot of people say that and then we never hear from them again.  You can have my word.  It's very hurtful.  Like tomorrow we have an opening.  Next week we have an opening.  Maybe next week.  We're going to figure this out with Roland, okay?  All right, cool.  It's Jimmy Fallon, everyone.  Check out Car Wash for Peace.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Thanks for having me, guys.  And yeah, go to fisherhouse.org and do the right thing.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:14:00]  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  All right.  I'm so sick of all the news on TV.  All this fighting got me going crazy.  And someone wrote on my car,  Please clean me.  Now I know what I got to do.  Listen, everybody, I'm talking to you.  Let's have a car wash for peace. 
[02:14:30]  There's trouble in the Middle East.  There'll be no more wars or dirty cars.  Car wash for peace.  Just remember, we got to get together in the parking lot across from Walmart, super center.
