<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of a Liam Neeson film, quickly transitioning to somber news.  Comedian Otto, a frequent guest known for his puppet George, had passed away.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with in-studio guests Bob Kelly and Jim Florentine, shared memories of Otto, detailing his darkly humorous, often shocking comedy, his struggles with substance abuse (followed by a period of sobriety), and his career from street performer to appearances at New York clubs like Fast Daddy's, Pips, and Governor's.  They recounted anecdotes about his performances, his relationship with his girlfriend Trish, and his later quieter suburban life.  David Copperfield called in, sharing his own memories of Otto and their mutual interest in ventriloquism.  The segment was a mix of sadness and laughter as they recalled Otto's life and legacy.

The conversation then shifted to Opie and Anthony's own 20-year career.  David Copperfield, still on the line, praised Otto’s comedic genius.  Opie and Anthony discussed their early career, the role of Anthony’s brother Joe in their partnership, their move from Long Island to Boston, and their subsequent move to New York. They recalled their infamous Boston April Fool's Day prank announcing the mayor's death, leading to their firing.  They discussed their constant battles with management, their commitment to pushing boundaries, and the various sponsors they had over the years (including car dealerships, a meatball company, debt relief services, adult products, and oil well investments).

The show continued with a retrospective on their time in New York City. They described their initial struggles and their decision to abandon a conventional radio format in favor of their signature outrageous style, likening it to an addiction or the thrill of a serial killer. They expressed their dislike for pre-written comedic bits, preferring genuine interactions.  The addition of Jim Norton to the show was discussed, alongside Opie and Anthony's personal struggles, including marital problems. The infamous "Sex for Sam" stunt and its consequences (their firing from terrestrial radio, continued payments from their former employer, and their move to satellite radio) were recounted, along with further near-firings due to stunts involving Homeless Charlie and naked women. They discussed the changing media landscape and the evolving dynamic between Opie, Anthony, and Norton, with Norton acting as a moderating force.  Other recurring guests and staff, including Patrice O'Neal, Rich Vos, and E-Rock, were mentioned.

A segment dedicated to listener calls for their 20th anniversary hotline followed.  Ziggy Marley was mentioned as a guest.  This segment featured a large number of advertisements (including erectile dysfunction medication, fuel system cleaner, hotels, payroll services, tires, binary options trading, email security, nitric oxide supplements and various food products).  A comedic bit about Razor Rollerboard scooters and a man repeatedly riding one past a house led to a "cinnamon challenge" with E-Rock, resulting in a violent coughing fit and apparent bleeding, prompting a call from a doctor warning of the dangers of inhaling cinnamon.  Ron and Fez visited the studio, discussing a pinball machine destroyed on air.  Chubby Checker and Sabra Cadabra made a surprise appearance with an impromptu musical performance. Bernie provided commentary, including remarks on a Weekly World News article and strip club etiquette.

A chaotic in-studio incident with Bernie unfolded, involving a CD swap prank with a disc titled "Haunted Pussy." Bernie's angry reaction and subsequent calming down were described. This was followed by a retrospective on a past stunt: dropping paint-filled bras from a hot air balloon over a television station. Whoopi Goldberg made a live in-studio visit, addressing the hosts' controversial antics, discussing their style and target audience, and engaging in a conversation with the hosts. Various commercial advertisements were interspersed throughout the broadcast.

Whoopi Goldberg's visit continued,  with conversations touching upon comedians’ insecurities, how the hosts handle criticism, Whoopi's own experiences with media misrepresentation, her varying comedic styles, her relationship (or lack thereof) with Oprah, prostate exams, and dealing with negative feedback.  The conversation involved profanity and insults, mostly directed at the hosts’ perceived critics.  There was a running joke about a jingle from Whoopi's show. The hosts expressed their appreciation for negative publicity. Whoopi expressed discomfort with their aggressive style but also some appreciation for their approach.  The segment ended with a photo with Whoopi, more banter about the audience, and a brief mention of Cedric the Entertainer as a previous guest.  The remainder of this section consisted of commercial advertisements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  great. It stunk. It was fucking  great. A terrible story.  I loved it.  It was predictable garbage.  Don't be scared of him.  You loved it. It was terrible.  It was a terrible movie. I love Liam Neeson.  I think he's amazing.  Her big dad! Stepdad  have pony!  And then at the end he brings the fucking  big singer. I saved her life.  It was fucking horrendous.  It was good action though.  The action was good, yes. But so what? 
[00:00:30]  That's all coming up on the next  At The Movies with Norton and Voss.  The Opie and Anthony show  remembers Otto and George.  But I bet you if you're defined like that  they figure out a way to get you out of the taping.  Because they're desperate people  that want to  contact loved ones.  What's the matter, Jimmy? What happened?  You okay?  Are you okay? What happened?  Are you okay?  Oh no. 
[00:01:00]  Are you okay?  Want to go to break?  Uh oh.  Jesus.  What?  What?  That's not good.  We'll be right back.  Sorry about that.  Well, it's completely  reasonable. 
[00:01:30]  Jesus.  Yeah, I got a call.  What happened?  I didn't...  That wasn't a radio tease.  I got a call from Jim Florentine.  I knew it was bad news  because he wouldn't call me on the air.  Yeah, you ran out of here.  I knew something was up.  And Otto died.  And I just couldn't say it when I came back.  Yeah.  I just...  Obviously, it's always hard to say that,  but I just physically couldn't say it,  so I wrote it down.  But it wasn't to be mysterious.  No.  It wasn't some stupid tease.  I don't know what he died of.  I don't know.  Apparently, he had taken a nap  and just didn't wake up. 
[00:02:00]  Jeez.  He was 53.  That's pretty bad.  That's terrible.  Fuck.  We've known him a long time.  You've known him forever.  Fucking...  You comics.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Fucking believable.  I don't know if it was tied into  what had happened  where he was in the hospital for a while.  Yeah, he was in the hospital  last year, was it?  For a while?  Almost...  Was it meningitis or something?  Meningitis or some sort, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Hmm.  So, I guess his girlfriend  was calling people,  and this was just the first I heard of it.  Fuck.  It's just heartbreaking.  Look.  No shit.  Wow.  Yeesh.  That just out of nowhere.  Yeah.  That shit just blindsides you.  He was a funny fucking guy, man.  Oh, fuck.  I mean, we always say that  about people  when they die off court,  but Otto was a funny  fucking guy. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, I don't think that.  No one made me laugh  harder than him.  No one.  I don't get that.  As a guy.  So fucking funny.  So inappropriately funny.  I love it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  That fucking...  That break we did  where he talked about  the fucking lady  from Wizard of Oz  dying.  Right.  Get me some twisty ties  and I don't remember  in hay.  There was something he said  that was such a brutal...  Right.  It was fucking brutal.  Oh, man.  Oh, boy. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, boy.  Jeez.  It's like, what do you say?  You don't even know what to say.  No, it's just fucking...  It's a bummer.  It seemed like he was doing,  you know, pretty good, too.  Yeah.  Got over that illness,  which was extremely scary  for him and, you know,  everybody else.  He was in the hospital a while.  Wasn't it...  He was in Canada for what?  Was it for the comedy festival?  Oh, I didn't even know  what he was doing. 
[00:04:00]  Then you fast forward,  he came in here looking great.  All rested and tan  and feeling much better.  Yeah.  We were just...  I mean, you always say that  when you're done.  We were texting the other day  back and forth  doing Bob Levy  and Clockwork Orange.  That was the last thing  we were talking about  was Bobby.  It was fun, too.  Oh, shit.  I realized when I was  texting him, too.  Like, I'm such a perv  with my phone  and I'm such a piece of garbage, 
[00:04:30]  but I'm like,  it's so nice to be  just texting a friend  and having some laughs,  like not...  Funny stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had an odd revelation  while I was doing that.  Like, it's so nice  to be texting healthy  and just having some fun together.  Right, not just looking  for pussy or trolling.  It made me feel  really normal and healthy.  Yelling at somebody  or something.  Yeah, just having some laughs.  Did some amazing stuff  for this radio show.  Did our comedy festival.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  I knew him way before then,  though,  when he was performing  at Fast Daddy's  in Huntington.  Oh, yeah, he was in Huntington  all the time.  He would just slay.  He's been a fucking  name to go see  for years.  The whole town  knew about him  because he would come up  to Fast Daddy's  and just kill it.  Yeah.  He was just amazing.  Never really got his due.  No, he never did.  Nope.  No, he didn't.  Bob Levy.  Bobby.  Yeah.  I just got the call 
[00:05:30]  just now  and I'm just shocked, man.  I mean,  we were friends  for like 20-something years  and, you know,  he finally got his life together  and for this to happen,  you know,  we were just talking  last week  about stories  from what we used to do  when we were crazy  and we're like,  I can't believe  we're still alive  and, you know,  I don't know what happened,  you know?  Right.  It's just like,  it just blows me away  that just one after another, 
[00:06:00]  I mean,  we're going down,  you know,  it's like fucking wrestlers  have shit like a comedian.  What the fuck are you  just telling jokes,  you know?  And it's just like,  this really hit me, man.  And we were going to hang out.  We, you know,  in a week or two,  we were going to Florida  for a gig  and he goes,  let's stay a few days  and hang out  and have a good time  and get some sun.  And I was like,  yeah, man,  that sounds great.  And it's just like  fucking unbelievable  because, you know, 
[00:06:30]  he is,  he was a legend  in his business  and always will be known  as that.  And that's got to be kept up.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  He may have been  more underground  than most people,  but there,  a lot of,  most of the people  that are underground  are better than you see  on TV.  So...  When you pop up  on other comics,  favorite comic lists,  you know,  like he was...  He was always  on a lot of people's lists.  When you talk to comics  about who was  fucking hilariously funny, 
[00:07:00]  it's fucking Otto.  Right.  You know?  Bob,  how was he doing lately?  I mean,  he was on our show,  I don't know,  not that long ago  and he looked great.  Not that long ago,  yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Like,  he called me up  and he goes,  it's hard to have  a couple beers,  right?  You know?  And I was like,  you know,  you don't need to drink.  I mean,  but you know,  he just wanted  to sit in the yard,  you know?  And like,  he was basically sober.  He was off the coke, 
[00:07:30]  you know?  I mean,  and I just hope  it's not,  you know,  people fall back.  You know,  I haven't fall back  and fell back  in, you know,  almost four years now.  But, you know,  it could shock  your body and that shit.  But I just,  I just,  you know what I mean?  I just hope  it went peaceful  because,  I mean,  like working with him,  like it was  the greatest thing  because we used  to go to Pips  to work,  right?  And that was  a well-known comedy club.  A lot of big stars 
[00:08:00]  came out of there.  David Brenner,  you know what I mean?  Dyson.  Dyson.  Many more.  And we played there  one weekend  and he looked at me  and he goes,  we made it.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Because in comedy,  most fans think  you make it  when you've got it  on TV  or something like that.  When you're,  most of the show on TV,  they couldn't follow me  with their fucking  dick in their hands,  okay?  So they ain't fucking  nothing compared to us. 
[00:08:30]  And,  uh,  it's just fucking,  it's just so shocking  when I got the call.  Like,  out of,  it's just like,  you know,  when you just talk  to somebody  and you're just  talking about the future  and saying,  you know,  let's team up together.  We'll get Roger  to get us some  dirty shows,  you know?  Yeah, yeah.  He seems so fucking happy,  you know what I mean?  Because he loves work.  We always had fun working,  you know,  I have such great,  I'm writing a book now  and we were going  over stories  that we did together 
[00:09:00]  when we were a party  and when,  like,  we,  after a show,  we got a gram of coke  and he made me  bring George home first  before we did it  because he couldn't  sit in the trunk.  And that was,  like,  years ago.  But he's clean,  you see what I mean?  When you fucking  get your shit cleaned up,  you can talk about it  and laugh at shit.  Right.  And this is fucking shocking.  You know what I mean?  There's someone  that I've known 
[00:09:30]  since fucking  I started this fucking thing  and looked up to  and was the nicest guy.  If anybody says  a bad word  about Otto,  you don't fucking know him  or you're a fucking asshole.  He was off stage.  That guy,  he might have been  the filthiest motherfucker  and I was just bragging  to him,  about him,  to someone the other day.  I go,  he is the filthiest  motherfucker out there  but he is hilarious 
[00:10:00]  and you can watch him  over and over.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's just,  it's really fucking shocking  that fucking,  this shit is going on,  man.  I don't understand it,  man.  I mean,  I'm like fucking lost  right now  because I just got  the phone call  and  Yeah,  this shit's always  fucked up.  Just don't know  what to do or say.  Right.  Just walk around  in a haze.  Yeah,  it's like you don't know 
[00:10:30]  what to say.  You don't know,  like what the fuck  he is saying to his girlfriend,  you know what I mean?  Yeah.  You know?  I mean,  the way I look at it,  you gotta take care of it,  do a show,  you know what I mean?  Fucking raise some money,  you know?  You gotta do something  in his name,  you know?  Yeah.  He was a fucking legend.  I don't give a fuck.  You know what I mean?  All these douchebags  can get on fucking TV  or whatever the fuck  with their shit material  because they got  a pretty look  or something like that.  But let me tell you something,  the real fucking legends 
[00:11:00]  are the ones  that fucking  go out there  and bust their balls  every night  and fucking kill  in front of people.  Yeah.  And there should be  something of fun  made up for him  where his name  would carry on  because,  I mean,  he did mean a lot  to a lot of fucking people  and,  of course,  you guys.  I mean,  he fucking loves you guys,  you know?  He's always talked  about you guys,  you know?  Right.  Because you guys  are fucking real,  you know?  He was fucking hilarious 
[00:11:30]  on the show too,  yeah.  Yeah,  he came to you guys  because you guys  are fucking real.  He's a real fucking person.  He's not into  the bullshit Hollywood.  That's why he came to you,  you know?  I gotta tell you,  that George thing  was creepy though  at times.  I remember that.  Oh, yeah.  I remember at N.E.W.,  he comes in  in the early days  when we didn't know him  that well  and he's just  killing it for us  and then,  like,  in between breaks,  he always loved  reading the newspaper.  Otto loved  getting knowledge 
[00:12:00]  and he's reading  the newspapers  while we're in break  and I look over  and then I kind of,  like,  get ants' attention.  I go,  you gotta look at this.  What is he doing?  And he's reading  the newspaper  and George is reading  along with Otto.  Like,  he's moving George's head  and stuff.  He's moving his eyes  like back and forth.  And I never forgot that  because I'm thinking,  oh my God,  he's not doing this  for anyone.  He doesn't even realize  we're looking at him  right now.  He's reading.  And I'm like,  what is that about?  Well,  that's what it is.  It becomes,  like,  you know,  it's part of you. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like,  to him.  And,  like,  when he was done  with his set,  like,  no one can tell you,  he would wrap his doll up,  his head up,  like,  you know,  like an Iranian  or something like that  so it was comfortable.  It had,  like,  the headgear on it.  But it always had to go home  before we went out  after a show.  Man.  And,  and he always had,  like,  you know,  Rodney loved him,  okay?  And he always had,  he goes,  listen to this message.  We always, 
[00:13:00]  every time we went back,  we listened to it.  And he's like,  hey,  kid,  I'm telling you,  you know what I mean?  Let's go.  You got it,  you know?  You're the man,  you know?  You missed your laugh,  you know?  But,  you know,  I think he was  somewhat a little bit  afraid of success.  Yeah,  yeah.  And,  but the whole thing was  is that you never,  you can never sit down  with a guy  and just,  like,  a sweetheart.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Like,  you know,  there's scumbags  in this business. 
[00:13:30]  You know what I mean?  But,  you know,  I mean,  nobody could say that  about him.  I mean,  he was a true  fucking person.  And,  you know,  it's just,  you wake up  and you're just fucking,  you know,  I'm listening to you guys.  I finally got my schedule  set up  and fucking,  I got a call  and I'm like,  this has got to be  a fucking joke  because we were just  talking last week.  We were supposed to go  to Florida  next Friday,  Saturday.  Right,  yeah.  And I'm like, 
[00:14:00]  fuck,  we were going to hang out  in that shit.  And fucking,  I'm just like,  I don't,  you know what I mean?  It makes you think  about everything,  you know?  It's just fucking  heart-breaking.  You never know.  It's a guy who never got  his due in the business  and,  you know,  he's just another funny guy  who the business  just did not  give what he deserved to.  Right.  He was another funny guy  with all these  fucking mediocre  motherfuckers 
[00:14:30]  because the critics  like him  and because  they carry  the right narrative  or ideology  and a brilliantly  funny guy like him.  And Otto was  punch you in the stomach  funny.  Nobody made people laugh.  When he killed,  it was absolutely  unfollowable.  Yeah.  And he's one of those guys  that all the comedians  would walk in to watch.  And I remember  somebody at a roast,  it was years ago,  this is probably  1992 or 93,  was talking about somebody 
[00:15:00]  and they said,  they mentioned,  what did he say  about Otto?  He said something  about you'll notice  that the comedians  in the room,  he was a roast  that the public was at  and he said,  you'll know who the comedians  in the room are  because they're the ones  in the room  who are not laughing  until Otto is on  and then they're going  to be the only ones  who are.  I always remember  that is such a great  description of mixing  Otto with comics  and the public.  Right.  And he was just  that's what he always 
[00:15:30]  said.  He always said,  how come these pieces  of shit are on TV  and we can't get  a fucking special?  You know what I mean?  He goes,  he goes,  it's because,  you know what I mean?  Like these MTV guys  got 15 fucking minutes.  They're fucking  selling alcohol.  Are you fucking  kidding me?  Comedy is a fucking  like,  you know,  like me,  Jerry,  you know,  Otto,  Florentine,  you know,  everybody that you  know that's fucking  anybody that's 
[00:16:00]  fucking powerful  and knows comedy.  It's just,  you're such a shitty  fucking business  because they put out  shit on TV  yet,  you know what I mean?  So people don't go  as the clubs.  They're like,  if this is within clubs,  no,  that's not within clubs.  We're in fucking clubs.  Right.  Come and see  fucking real comedy,  man.  not some fucking  18-year-old  fucking girl  that has 15  fucking minutes.  It's just one  of those things.  Thank you, 
[00:16:30]  brother.  I'll talk to you soon.  I'll see you.  I'm sure I'll see you  before the thing.  Yeah,  Bob,  thanks,  man.  Help out the family  with.  All right,  Bobby.  Thank you,  brother.  Bob Lee,  he was very close  with Otto.  George,  Jimmy just told us  that Otto  died in his sleep.  Yeah,  I got the call  from Jim  during the thing.  I just,  it's really weird  to not be able  to say that,  you know,  I just couldn't say it.  Right.  It was,  you know,  whatever,  we all act weird  when we hear that  and then you take  a couple minutes 
[00:17:00]  but it's just terrible.  Do you remember  the first time  you met him  or saw him?  Yep.  It was in the  Varsity Pub  and it was before  I did comedy.  I was just starting  and me and my buddy  would go to watch shows  through our first  saw Florentine  and guys like  Quentin Higgs  and that guy,  Jeff Zabrowski  who I did get  an update on by  when he retired  and won some kind  of lotteries.  Oh,  really?  Yeah,  he's doing good.  But Otto  was one of the guys  that Patrick Gaynor  who was the guy  who really,  I would not be doing  comedy if it wasn't  Patrick Gaynor,  told me. 
[00:17:30]  Who was Patrick Gaynor?  I don't even know.  He was a local booker  and he died years ago  and the Varsity Pub  was the first place  I ever went on.  So I would go  and watch the shows  on the weekends  and I would never  heckle the comics.  Sometimes Patrick  would let me  introduce the show  just to get me  on stage  before I ever performed  and that's where  I saw Otto  for the first time  and it was like  seeing Zeppelin  for, you know.  Yeah.  Jesus.  The Opie and Anthony  show remembers  Otto and George. 
[00:18:00]  Otto and George.  Got Bob Kelly  and Jim Florentine  in studio.  Woo.  We all were  just laughing along  to that one.  Funny shit.  This sucks.  How are you guys?  It's rough, man.  Yeah.  Scared?  His girlfriend  called me yesterday  morning and told me.  Right.  I wound up calling Jim  because I didn't know  if he wanted to hear  it secondhand  or whatever.  Yeah, I would rather  have heard it from you.  Yeah.  Some fucking... 
[00:18:30]  What's that?  Oh, that was me  listening to you guys  in the way  and my phone  just turned on.  Oh, Bobby.  Oh, thank you, Bobby.  Yeah, I listened to you.  How did we sound?  It was very funny.  Anarchist made me laugh.  It's Noah.  Noah.  Oh, right.  Anarchist.  Anarchist.  We got David Teller  on the line as well here.  Ooh.  Dave.  Hey, guys.  What a sad loss.  Am I right or what?  Yeah.  Yeah, very depressing, man. 
[00:19:00]  You know,  when I heard,  I called Jim  and then I spent  the rest of the day  trying to think  of the first time  I saw him live  and it was either,  I think, Jim,  we were both saying  it was either Pips  in Brooklyn  or Governors  where I saw him  or then mostly Magic,  that old club  in the city.  But it was one  of those three.  That's where I saw him live.  For me,  it was Jersey.  It was...  Varsity Pub.  Varsity Pub.  I saw him at the...  Remember the Boston Comedy Club 
[00:19:30]  had Black Night?  Oh, yeah,  on a Sunday.  Every Sunday night,  Black Night.  Two shows sold out  every fucking Sunday.  And I went in there  and when I first moved  to New York  and he comes on  and it's Black Eyed Black.  I mean,  just annihilating.  I mean,  you know,  fucking roof shaking  and he comes on  and it just got quiet.  And then he did that line  and he goes,  he goes,  yeah,  black girl's pussy  looks like a fucking wallet.  And it just exploded. 
[00:20:00]  I was like,  this motherfucker's crazy.  He just killed.  Killed.  The Varsity Pub  was the first time  I saw him too.  Yeah.  So I see everybody  go through there, man.  That's where I met you.  That's where I fucking saw  just a bunch of Quentin.  A whole shitload of people.  There's nothing better  than watching the crowd,  like 20% or 30% of the crowd  that didn't know  who Otto was  walk out of the room  and be so disgusted  like their faces.  But everything he said  and then people  just slowly leaving. 
[00:20:30]  And he's like,  get out,  stay out.  It's a scream ass.  One time at Governor's,  this fat woman  was heckling him  and she was leaving.  She's yelling at him.  He's yelling back  and she's walking out.  She's like,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  And he just goes,  I'm getting heckled  by Java the cunt.  He was a real pig.  But the people that stayed,  man,  would just laugh.  Absolutely.  That's a great show.  Yeah.  He's one of those guys,  man.  Oh my God.  Unbelievable. 
[00:21:00]  He was funny,  funny,  funny.  And here he was fucking,  just,  oh yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  He'd just sit there  and he'd be like,  you're all right?  And then he'd just say something.  Yeah,  when he would get rolling  on something,  man.  Oh my God.  He was a funny dude,  man,  just as a guy.  It's like the puppet  was the puppet,  but it was,  we just,  we would go to gigs.  We spent so many hours.  We drove to Buffalo together  a few times,  Pittsburgh and just those  seven,  eight hour car rides.  He was fucking hilarious  as a guy,  just as a,  just a fucking mean,  humored,  funny,  critical guy. 
[00:21:30]  He was just,  he was just hilarious.  He could come up with a good  obscure movie reference too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can I say,  can I say something?  I hate to throw up,  but when he did the Dave's All Porn  and unfortunately the show  was canceled before we got  to like edit and put his,  his thing together  because he was going to be  in the season three  and he,  he came down,  Otto and George,  they both came down  and they,  you know,  we're doing,  we wanted to do a special  couple show where it was  like couples.  Right.  I figured it would be great  to have the two of them on  and,  you know,  I didn't know like how versed 
[00:22:00]  and knowledgeable he is  about movies  because we were watching,  I think it was like  an orgy scene  and like an old retro  like Teen Angel  or something  and he goes,  I go,  this is a classic,  am I right?  And he goes,  yes,  much like John Ford's  The Searchers.  I'm like,  what?  I'm like,  you got to dumb it down,  dude.  You don't know  what you're talking about.  The guy knows classics.  Yeah.  He really did.  He was,  he was like a,  it was really,  he clad up the show, 
[00:22:30]  I guess.  That's what I'm trying to say.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Yeah,  he was a really,  really weird movie buff.  He just loved those  old 70s movies.  Old stuff.  Big Ivan and Costello fan.  Huge.  Lauren Hardy.  Yeah,  Lauren Hardy.  Yeah,  yeah.  March Brothers.  When I break over his house,  he had all those DVDs.  He's always lending me to it.  I'm like,  I don't know if I'm going  to be able to watch this.  He had all these movies.  Watch this one,  watch this one.  I'm like,  he was like from that time.  He was.  It's so weird,  you know.  He would have fit in perfectly  back then.  Ah,  vaudeville. 
[00:23:00]  You got to talk about  how nice he was too,  man.  And really appreciated  people around him.  Appreciate what we did for him.  Said it a million times.  Like,  it's cool.  I was cool,  you know.  And appreciated just the  simple things in life as well.  Greg,  I was neighbors with him.  Right.  At one point,  I lived right around  the corner from him.  And then,  you know,  still live just a few miles away.  I bring my son over there  once every 10 days.  Right.  Loved them.  Yeah.  Loved going out.  Otto would make us food  and make my son food.  We both have these  two little gay Yorkies. 
[00:23:30]  Otto has one  and I have one.  So they'd come over  and they'd run around  the backyard  and it's a little play date  for the dog.  Oh yeah,  we always,  he's like,  bring the dog here.  Come on,  we'd have a little play date.  We'd walk him down the street.  Otto's like,  look at us two homos  walking with two little Yorkies.  But my son just,  in fact,  loved him.  Really?  Constantly talked to him.  Let's go visit Otto.  Let's go visit Otto.  Oh man,  that sucks.  Did you see the set on TV?  On YouTube or whatever,  it's Otto Works Clean.  Yeah,  with the little kids.  He's performing for little kids  at a kid's birthday party. 
[00:24:00]  I never said,  where is that?  Yeah,  he throws in a couple  of really adult references,  but none of them are dirty.  But it was fun.  It was just shot  like on a video camera.  It's like four minutes.  He did a lot of that stuff though.  He really created  his own content a lot.  Yeah,  he had to.  You know,  he had that pig roast thing.  This thing called  the Teletubbies he did.  He did a lot of stuff,  yeah.  Right.  He was always shooting  some kind of...  The pig roast was funny,  man.  Hilarious.  That was really well done.  Can I ask a question?  Sure.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Chip,  did he really start  when he was 15?  Because I really do think  that that's like his origin story,  that he started when he was 15.  Yeah,  14.  14,  I think it was,  on the streets of New York.  It was a street performer.  Yeah.  Yeah,  street performer,  that's right.  Okay.  He never worked a day,  like a real job in his life,  and he had,  there's a lot of pictures,  if you Google Otto and George pictures,  he was actually,  he would tweet them,  he was actually tweeting them,  like probably two weeks ago,  or a week ago,  these old school pictures of him, 
[00:25:00]  where he has a derby on,  and he's 15 years old,  and he's in the streets  of New York working,  and it was just,  you know,  because he's,  and I read that thing  that he wrote for,  the comments that influenced him,  and he said it was Laurel and Hardy,  and he liked that derby,  because Laurel and Hardy had derby,  so he would,  he wore that for years.  It looked like the clockwork orange.  Exactly,  yeah,  that's why he looked like Alex,  with his fucking little hairdo,  right?  That's how old he was,  15 years old,  look at those old pictures,  Otto and George online,  man,  it's amazing to see.  Just go to his Twitter,  Otto and George on Twitter,  they're all there.  He never worked another job, 
[00:25:30]  a day job,  but it's life.  Never.  Ever.  Which is great,  I mean,  pure performer.  Yeah.  I saw him for the first time  at Fast Eddie's,  I know you guys performed  at Huntington,  and man,  I mean,  we would tape it  and then just make copies  for everybody.  Everybody wanted,  you know,  a copy of his performances  at Fast Eddie's.  Just killing the place.  That's where I first heard  the scene from True Romance.  Right.  The fucking famous  Dennis Hopper scene.  I hadn't seen the movie yet,  and Otto's on stage  and he just starts doing  that dialogue to some guy 
[00:26:00]  in the fucking audience.  And it really,  it chilled the room a bit.  I bet.  I couldn't believe  he was saying that to somebody.  I'm like,  what are you doing, dude?  We were surprised  his last appearance  on the show  was seven months ago.  This show is weird  because I would have said  it was a month or two ago.  Right.  And then you see the date  and it was September,  I think,  26th of 2013.  How was he doing?  He was doing great.  That's what I thought.  You know,  I would see him  at least three times a month.  We'd go over there  during the day,  we'd hang out,  and he was totally, 
[00:26:30]  you know,  sober.  He did a gig Friday night.  Yeah,  he did have a lot.  According to his Twitter.  Wow.  He had a lot of gigs lined up.  He was in great shape.  He looked,  he had that,  you know,  the bacterial meningitis thing  happened about 10 months ago.  Right.  Like last Memorial Day.  And,  you know,  he was basically in a coma  for a week.  Right.  On a ventilator and everything.  They didn't think  he was going to make it.  So I don't know  if that,  you know,  affected his health.  Right.  Later on,  I don't know  how much damage  that does  on the insides.  Right.  Probably did something  to his brain.  You know,  we don't know  what happened,  but,  you know,  it was in the afternoon  yesterday,  so it wasn't like 
[00:27:00]  he was out partying  all night  or Sunday afternoon  when this happened.  So it wasn't like...  Yeah,  last time we saw him,  he was right there.  He was great.  Funny as all hell  and didn't seem  like anything was going on.  Nothing at all.  Didn't seem like it  didn't seem like it.  No,  you know,  when they were worried  that with the bacterial meningitis  that he wasn't,  you know,  his brain wasn't going  to function right after that.  Oh, God,  it was...  And he came out of it  100%.  Oh, absolutely.  Wow.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  That was very rare.  It was only like  a 10% shot  of getting it all back.  Right.  Jesus.  You know,  by the way,  that's how Jerry Redd  went down.  Right. 
[00:27:30]  You know,  he went down  from meningitis.  What year was that  that Jerry Wilson died?  That was...  He died a year  before my father,  so that was like  15,  16 years ago.  Wow.  So,  I don't know.  What is that?  In 97?  Yeah,  something like that.  98-ish.  97,  98,  yeah.  Otto,  I talked to Trish yesterday  for about 20 minutes  and she said that he,  you know,  his diet was not good.  You know what I mean?  Like bacon,  like fucking whatever,  you know,  steak and mayo.  And so it may have been  a heart attack.  I mean,  I guess they'll find out 
[00:28:00]  in a week or so  however,  how long an autopsy takes.  But it might have just been,  you know.  How's she doing?  She's kind of a wreck.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  But,  it was great for Otto  that he moved to the suburbs  in Jersey.  He had a lawn,  a deck,  fence for his little dog  and just took walks  and stuff.  He needed that.  He needed to get out  of the city  and all that craziness  and get away from that.  He loved just hanging out  in his living room.  He had a big screen TV,  watch old movies,  hang out,  you know,  get some sun and stuff.  He really enjoyed that.  She said he loved  his Amazon car, 
[00:28:30]  his Amazon membership  because he would just  order movies off Amazon.  He just liked doing that.  He was trying to learn  an iPad.  You know what's funny  about him  is that East Coast,  we all know him  so well,  but when you go West Coast,  it's only like a really,  there's only very few people  that know about him.  They either were transplant  or they're just really  into sick humor.  And I don't know,  Jim,  whoever you guys know this,  but did he ever tour out there? 
[00:29:00]  Did he ever live in LA?  I mean,  did he ever do any of that?  No,  he hated it.  He hated LA.  He didn't like any part  of that business.  You know,  he got this,  you know,  he should have been  obviously a lot bigger  than he was.  Right.  But Ottawa wouldn't take  no shit if someone,  he thought someone  was fucking him over,  he'd tell him right to his face.  He didn't care if it was  an NBC executive.  Right.  He was like that.  Did he ever play Vegas?  Oh yeah,  he did a lot of Vegas.  He did Vegas.  That was about as far west  as I think he went,  is Vegas.  Yeah,  he's like,  Kevin Meany I saw last night 
[00:29:30]  and he mentioned it to me,  he goes,  I heard about Ottawa.  I'm like,  oh,  you knew him?  He goes,  oh,  I loved that.  Like every comic  that knew him loved him.  He was the guy that,  like he was one of the only guys  that we could quote to each other  without being sick to our stomachs.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Comedians never quote each other.  He's one of the guys  where if you work with him  six shows over a weekend,  you'd watch every show.  Yeah.  You'd have to go be out there  and watch  because you never know  what's going to happen  even if it's the same jokes  over and over again.  You didn't care.  You didn't care.  I never run down to see a comic.  Yeah.  But if he was around,  I just can't help but go watch it. 
[00:30:00]  Me and him picked up girls one time  in fucking Delaware  after a gig.  It was some awful,  but I've told this story before.  It was an awful bar gig  and we're in this girl's pool  and we're fooling around  and I'm fucking really hot.  I'm like playing with the girl's  pussy through her thing  and Otto's getting nothing  from his girl  and he's standing there  and he goes,  look at them.  They're like Melrose Place  and we're like meet the press.  Like what a funny,  funny motherfucker.  And then his Letterman set. 
[00:30:30]  Amazing.  It was great.  Just beating the shit  out of Letterman,  Paul Schaefer,  the gig itself.  Who does that?  Yeah.  This gig sucks.  It's Letterman.  It's Letterman.  Did Letterman appreciate that set?  I don't even know.  What did Letterman,  because the video online,  it just ends after he's done.  I want to know  what Letterman did after that.  He had to like it.  Letterman had to know  it was funny.  Yeah.  He had to know  Otto was up there.  I mean,  you know,  he did fucking  a fistful of testicles,  loved him, 
[00:31:00]  hated him.  He did gay jokes.  He did what he did.  Right.  It's amazing.  He pulled off  such a great Letterman set.  Someone told me  that at the end of that  when he shakes  Letterman's hand  that George actually goes,  yeah.  When he was shaking  Dave's hand.  That was such an amazing set  and that didn't push him forward.  That was 2007.  Yeah.  I wonder if he did  like the Bill Boggs  Comedy Hour  or any of those  like,  you know,  like kind of local,  you know,  showcase shows.  Joe Franklin.  Yeah.  Yeah, 
[00:31:30]  something like that.  He would reference  Joe Franklin  on our show a lot.  Yeah,  I think he did  and Uncle Floyd  and Joe Franklin.  Uncle Floyd  was another one.  There's a YouTube thing  of him on Al Goldstein  used to do.  Midnight Blue, yeah.  Midnight Blue  and him just ripping  Al Goldstein apart.  It's so fun.  Oh, yeah.  It's on YouTube.  I gotta see that.  Yeah, I'll search that out.  That's great.  Yeah.  Yeah, he did a lot  of those local,  what else did he do?  He did the Comedy's Dirtiest Dozen  full frontal comedy,  which I remember.  Comedy's Dirtiest Dozen  I think was with  Ben Creed and Hicks  and Chris Rock.  Yeah, Jackie Marling. 
[00:32:00]  Kenison was on, maybe?  No, maybe not.  No, it was 88.  I think Kenison was  already big by then.  Yeah.  And Full Frontal  was like 97.  I knew him when he did that.  I think Rick Messina  produced that.  You know,  Otto was a huge  George Carlin fan.  Right.  And he didn't know  Carlin knew him.  And Goddard was doing  this gig in Chicago  maybe 10,  I don't know,  10 years ago.  So Carlin was in town,  I guess,  doing a theater.  He had no idea.  Carlin came into  the comedy club  and sat in the back  and watched Otto.  Otto didn't know  he was there.  And he came back  and they talked  for like an hour.  Wow.  Oh, did they for a while?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Carlin was a huge 
[00:32:30]  Otto fan  and Otto had no idea.  He couldn't believe it.  Wow.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw the picture.  It was like in the kitchen  or something.  They took a photo together.  David Copperfield,  huge fan.  Huge fan, too.  He's actually calling  the show in about an hour  to talk about Otto.  Copperfield loves Otto.  Which band was it  that loved them?  STP, was it?  Was it?  I think it was STP.  I'm almost positive  it was STP.  He was obsessed  with Otto and George  as well.  Scott Weiland.  I think I'm getting this.  I don't remember that one. 
[00:33:00]  There was this bar  right down the street  from where we lived.  This little white trash bar.  Otto would hang out  there all the time.  So the owner convinced Otto  to do a show there,  a comedy show.  Otto's like,  all right, fine.  So he sets it.  I said,  I gotta go down  and see this.  So it's just Otto.  There's no other act.  So this fat DJ  is on the side of the stage  like stage right  in a bad tuxedo  with this bad DJ  fucking board  and albums.  It was still albums.  It was only like 10 years ago.  I had this guy  bringing crates of records.  So he goes,  all right,  we're going to start  the comedy show.  Give it up for Otto  and George.  And Otto just walked up there, 
[00:33:30]  just looked over,  the puppet looked over  at the guy and goes,  do a sit-up,  you fat fuck.  It was the first thing  he said.  It was the most  uncalled for thing.  The guy was just  this happy-go-lucky guy.  He was so excited  that there was a comic there.  Do a sit-up,  you fat fuck.  That's Otto.  Do you remember,  and I didn't see this  or comedians told me,  but do you remember  years ago  that kid got mauled  in the fucking zoo  by a polar bear?  Right.  And Otto was on stage  the next night  in George's little outfit 
[00:34:00]  and George was like,  do you like my shoes?  I got him outside  the polar bear cage.  Brutal!  Yeah,  he was quite an amusing man.  Mean.  That's so mean.  Yeah.  I love it.  But you'd hear stuff like that  and then,  well,  my wife,  we had our kid,  I was on the road  after like a month.  He was born  and he lived right around  the corner.  He'd go there like  three times a week  and check on my wife.  He'd go bring her milk.  He's like,  whatever you need,  he'd just walk around  the corner,  no problem,  I'll help him.  He didn't know 
[00:34:30]  what the hell  he was doing.  Right.  But that's just  the kind of guy he was.  He was a sweetheart.  I mean.  What's the story  of the puppet getting stabbed?  That was real, right?  Yeah, yeah.  In Central Park, was it?  Kind of a Spanish guy.  And the Spanish guy  actually stabbed the puppet.  Stabbed the puppet, yeah.  Yeah, but wasn't it  for like a mayor  Cox was there?  Like, how about a hand  for our gay mayor?  Is that the story?  I don't know.  I don't know.  There's a guy on the line 
[00:35:00]  that, nah.  The quote I heard  was Otto told Ron  actually during a,  I mastered whatever he did.  Ron said like,  who stabbed you  in the park?  And Otto said  a Puerto Rican.  Who else?  Right.  We're trying to get  the unmasked  for our podcast this week.  So we're doing  some kind of  Otto and George podcast.  It will be out tomorrow  on iTunes  and all those other places.  This guy,  do you know the story  of Otto getting stabbed  in Central Park  or George actually,  Buddha?  Yeah, what's up?  How do you know this story? 
[00:35:30]  Because he told me.  I used to do comedy  for a team in New York.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, okay.  I was at Pips  and I got off stage.  Now, Pips,  you get heckled  ridiculously  and I was like  ready to hang myself  because it never happened  to me.  I was only doing  comedy three months  and Otto  was on the side  and he liked me  and he came up to me  and I've been friends  with him since then  but he said to me,  he goes,  he goes,  don't worry about  getting heckled.  You'll get heckled  all the time.  I'm like,  yeah,  why have you been heckled? 
[00:36:00]  He goes,  heckled?  One time I was  in Central Park.  I was like 19,  18 years old  and he was doing  Puerto Rican jokes  and some dude  got pissed,  took a knife out  and stabbed the puppet  and I said to him,  I go,  what did you say to him?  You know,  there was a crowd around  and he looked right  at the guy and goes,  this cocksucker  thinks I'm real.  Yeah,  absolutely.  I'm like,  all right,  I guess heckling  isn't that bad  if I didn't get  stabbed tonight, 
[00:36:30]  thanks Otto.  I was friends  with him ever since,  man.  It's a horrible loss,  man.  Thanks a lot,  brother.  You're right.  Thank you.  You know,  I don't never,  like he always  was really nice  to young comedians.  He never had  an attitude  like Otto  and George.  He always brought  young guys around  and nurtured him  and told him  about comedy  and stuff like that.  He was always,  never thought he was  too big for anybody.  Well,  he needed rides.  He didn't need rides.  He never drove.  He was thinking  about getting  his driver's license.  He needed rides.  I didn't think about that. 
[00:37:00]  If it wasn't for Levy  being a drunk,  me and Norton  would probably still  be doing little  fucking firehouse  in Paris.  We would still be  fucking co-middling  somewhere.  Bob's alcoholism  got me so many gigs.  Same with me.  We cut our teeth  doing all these gigs  because Bob needed  to get drunk around.  Because he needed  a ride.  That's funny.  I would drive  from North Brunswick  to pick Otto  up in Queens  off Jewel Avenue  and then a lot of times  if we were doing  Pennsylvania or Pittsburgh  I would drive  back down the turnpike  to exit 6.  I didn't give a fuck.  Wow.  I never cared  but all I wanted 
[00:37:30]  to do was work  with Otto.  I just didn't care.  You're a hell of a guy.  No,  I just loved him.  He made me laugh.  You were a little fanboy.  I was a fanboy.  That's cool.  I used to go see him.  I remember trying  to see him  in Vinny's old club  before the stress factory.  What was that place  he booked on George Street  before the stress factory?  Wasn't there  another place down there?  There was like  a Clarion or something.  Oh, no,  maybe it was the stress factory.  It was a hotel gig.  Yeah, a hotel gig.  No, it was after that.  It might have been  the first stress factory  but it still had couches  and stuff.  I think it was brand new  the stress factory  whenever that opened up. 
[00:38:00]  Otto was like  two hours late  and we didn't know  if he was going to come  and I had a friend  who had to go home  so I just made my friend  leave  and he finally showed up  but I remember  I would go to gigs  knowing that he really  might not show up  just as a fan.  Yeah, what was that about?  He was doing drugs.  That was part of his  I think he was doing drugs  at that time.  He was bad  because he ran out  on us a few times  during the NAW days.  He would be killing.  I said this yesterday  but you guys  didn't hear probably.  He would start off  and he would be killing  for two or three minutes  and then he would  just get up and leave.  And me and Ant  would look at each other 
[00:38:30]  and then we would learn  later he thought  he was sucking  and was having a bad set  or whatever  and the opposite was true.  That's what would happen  when him in a lot of clubs  if he didn't feel like  the crowd was into him  he would just get off stage.  As a headliner  you have to do 45 minutes.  You have to do  at least 45.  There's no other way around  that at 20  he would just walk  like goodnight  and just fucking walk  off the stage.  He's like the crowd sucked.  I don't fuck them.  I don't care.  Some of the clubs  are like look  we can't have that.  You've got to do 45 minutes.  Wow. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, you just say  they were too tired.  Fuck them.  What would they do?  DMC would be like  at the bar.  He wouldn't even know  there's nobody on the stage.  Everybody's running.  There's fucking managers running.  Get on the stage.  Tell the crowd  they can't leave  because they've got to  pay their check.  Holy shit.  It's creating turmoil.  Yeah, you can't just walk off.  You're like fuck it.  That crowd sucked.  Fuck them.  I showed up at a couple gigs  after him  after he did that  and they're like  how much time are you doing?  I'm like I'm going to do an hour.  Are you sure?  Are you sure?  Yeah.  What the fuck are you talking about?  But in all fairness 
[00:39:30]  he got a lot of that together  in later years.  No, he did.  He wasn't doing much of that  sometimes the clubs  didn't advertise them right.  You have to put  triple X ventriloquist.  If not,  people are going to be horrified.  Oh, look.  A puppet.  I don't understand  people being horrified  in a comedy club.  I don't get that.  The thing though  when you see a puppet  you think  funny  TV funny.  Nice.  The first time I saw him  when he had a puppet  I was like  this is going to stink.  And then my fucking mouth  was open the whole show  like what the fuck 
[00:40:00]  did he just say?  I was sucking everybody off.  And then the Kennedy bit  when the fucking head  swaps off  it's like  And then when George  would say to Otto  he goes look at your hair  it looks like you combed  your hair with a cock.  And whenever the waitress  would be walking by  in the front  in the middle of his act  he goes can I get a cocktail?  A cock.  A cock.  A cock.  Get a suck that fucking cock.  Or you look into the crowd  and go look  oh it's a black guy  Guilty!  Guilty!  And then Otto 
[00:40:30]  would have to pull George  back onto his lap.  Come on now.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Don't say that  about people.  George.  The Opie and Anthony  show remembers  Otto and George.  The first time on our show  David Copperfield.  Yeah.  Hey David.  How are you guys?  How you doing?  Hey David.  How you doing?  It's Jim Florentine here.  Yeah we got  Bob Kelly  Jim Florentine  Jim Norton  Anthony  and myself Opie 
[00:41:00]  and we're all  devastated by  the passing of Otto.  Shocked right?  Shocked.  Yeah.  That's not good.  How did you first  come to know Otto?  Because he was actually  he loved the fact  that you guys were friends.  He spoke very highly of you.  Thank you.  Well we both  had the same inspiration.  You know we both  and I didn't know him  when he was just  you guys knew him  probably in the very beginning  but I didn't know him  until he was famous  until he really established himself.  I didn't know him  during the street performer days  or all that.  I knew him after  he was really famous.  In fact you know 
[00:41:30]  who turned me on  to Otto's  Kevin Spacey  believe it or not.  Wow.  Kevin Spacey  was a big Otto and George fan.  We heard this.  Do you know that guy?  I did not know that.  No I didn't know that either.  No someone  doesn't matter  but yeah I heard that before.  Kevin really loved him  and he was playing in New York  so you got to see him  and I heard  some of my crew  you know  loved his work  and played me  some video of him  and I thought  it was pretty  amazing stuff  at that moment  when it was starting  to be you know  noteworthy  and so I went 
[00:42:00]  to see his show  obviously  and it was  incredible  and you know  after we started talking  we realized  we had the same influences  both as kids  we were similar age  which kind of sucks  he said  you know  his influence  was Paul Winchell  and I don't know  if you guys  remember Paul Winchell  Paul Winchell  was a huge TV star  when we were kids  Winchell Mahoney  Paul Winchell  was a ventriloquist  who was the voice  of Tigger 
[00:42:30]  in the old  Oh right  all that sound  is that kind of  is Tigger  Paul Winchell  yeah Paul Winchell  and Jerry Mahoney  and that was  his influence  and that was  my influence too  I was a ventriloquist  when I was a kid  Winchell Mahoney time  exactly  I remember that  you're at Google Fingers  no no I swear  I really remember that  he's actually eating  turkey chili  Anthony's just really old  no but you know  I started doing  ventriloquism  and I totally sucked  at it  I couldn't do it 
[00:43:00]  my act was out of  the back of a boy's life  in a magazine  nobody laughed  and I found magic  but in Otto's case  he really found  pardon me  he found a voice  he found a voice  of how to do that  and kind of a repartee  that became distinctive  to him  yeah  and really had  that ability  and you know  as I got to know him  I realized  not from him  he never talked  about this  but you know  he's one of the  most ripped off  guys around  oh yeah 
[00:43:30]  and some famous  people who I won't  mention the name of  but you'll know  who it is  like literally  became famous  on his material  I mean  really became famous  on it  and stuff  that he developed  and was amazing  and for a magician  you know  that's what I do  by the way  I do magic  and when  when  if somebody  if somebody  you know  rips off  what I'm doing  it's devastating  because I spend  years on each  each thing  so I ask  how do I think  you know  so and so  got really famous  on your act 
[00:44:00]  how do you deal  with that  how do you do that  and he would say  it's okay  I was done with it  it's alright  I said what  are you kidding  I mean  you know  this person  is enormously famous  and he's using  your material  that you developed  oh it's okay  it's alright  oh my god  this guy was a really  giving guy  that really was  okay  with all that  kind of roll  with the punches  and didn't  you know  get pissed off  at this kind of thing  yeah yeah  amazing amazing  stuff  and I know  you guys know  what I'm talking about  but it's like  incredible  you have the original 
[00:44:30]  George too right  or not the original  but the more recent  before the new one  I got one of the  I mean  the original  all the Georges  were kind of  the train wrecks  you know  there was a whole point  he wanted a really  beautiful figure  and I said  well okay  I'll help you  because I have  all these friends  and the world  of  kind of  side world  of ventriloquism  and magic  and I had a guy  that could build  a really beautiful  George  well you can't  if you build  another George 
[00:45:00]  for yourself  and I help you  with this  it's got to be  kind of screwed up  it's got to be  kind of  you know  a little bit  screwy looking  no no  I want a beautiful  George  no no  that pointed  you're at  it's got to look  a little bit  screwed up  no no  I want this beautiful  okay  so I got this  beautiful thing  that he donated  to a museum  that I  kind of curate  that I have  that is  this  you know  this figure  that you know  is the one  that's known  you know  the one  that you've seen  all the pictures 
[00:45:30]  where it's  kind of  cob together  and  you know  what's kind  of beautiful  in a way  is that  this will  George  is in my museum  right next to  our inspiration  you know  Paul Winchell  and Jerry Mahoney's  stuff  all his  the Winchell family  has allowed me  to kind of  oh my  you got that stuff  too  wow  so he came  one of the great  moments  you know  that he said  in his life  was he came  really the past  couple years  to my place  in my museum  in Las Vegas  and just 
[00:46:00]  looking at  you know  all  Edgar Bergen  and Charlie  McCarthy  and Howdy Doody  and you know  all these  iconic characters  and Paul Winchell  and Jerry Mahoney  stuff  and all the archives  and there's  and there's George  you know  sitting there  with all the stuff  and he like  starts to cry  you know  seeing all the stuff  it's like  this resting place  for his  you know  one of his  original  Georges  so it's kind of  a beautiful thing  and what's really  remarkable about it  is that  a lot of people  who are 
[00:46:30]  in our business  that come  and see this stuff  not only the magic  but the ventriloquism  stuff  they go in  and they see  you know  all these iconic  Shari Lewis  remember Shari Lewis  oh yeah  and then I have  the puppets  from the twilight zone  there's a couple  of ventriloquism  oh yeah  and  and  they're there  and then they turn  the corner  and they see  George  on his puppet  and they go  oh my god  that's George  the most unlikely 
[00:47:00]  people  who you'd never  imagine  are familiar  with  Otto and George's  work  and they go  wow  it's the hurricane  twilight zone  and George  so it's really  he made an amazing  mark  and it makes me  really  really  really  feeling so warm  that he did  such a  you know  a great thing  for  this  world of  ventriloquism  and comedy  and you know  all the  Penn and Teller  love  people really  love this guy  so  yeah  David  when was the  first time  you saw Otto 
[00:47:30]  live  where were you  you said  Kevin Spacey  took you  but where was it  it was in  New York  I think it was  what's downstairs  in right off  time square  is it  Caroline's  or what was that  Caroline's  yes  Caroline's  yeah  and  yeah  I saw him  live there  first  and  you know  he came to  Vegas  I think  in the past  year  I had him  come here  just to  perform for our  crew  you know  believe it or  not  so  and he just  you know  got sober  and all that  kind of stuff  you know  it was a really  it was a really 
[00:48:00]  good trip  and seeing  all the  you know  his figures  and his pictures  and so forth  and the little  display we made  for him  was a really  good  I'm totally  shocked  yeah  yeah  he was doing  really well  too  you know  I just tweeted  Bob Levy tweeted  I retweeted  this video of him  in your  I guess  museum  and you  showing  you showing  him the puppets  oh wow  so there's actually  some video of that  online I guess  on Facebook  so  I retweeted that  I haven't seen it yet  I'm going to watch it 
[00:48:30]  at the end of the show  oh absolutely  that's great  man  well  I'm sorry guys  it's just  kind of a  sucky way of  meeting in the morning  yeah it is  yeah  we get it  but  I mean he really  he was highly  a you  family should be  really proud of him  family should be  amazing proud of him  you know  the  you know  obviously  he  the material  was extremely dirty  which is the most  awesome thing in the world  he handled it so well  and his family should know  that you know  the most 
[00:49:00]  you know  really respected  Oscar winning  people  watched this  and went  wow this is really cool  something about it  the way he would  turn the phrase  you know  a Galliano bottle  you know  yeah  right  exactly  you know  paper plate  words he would use  which is like  oh just so well chosen  comedically well chosen  he had an amazing grasp  on  on using  violent language  in comedy  like  but violent  and look  Stephen King  made a tremendous living  using violent language 
[00:49:30]  well  and Otto did it  brilliantly  in  in comedy  was these  these amazing images  of people's skulls  being cracked open  but the funny part  was that he used  an ashtray  or just these  these odd  things used  to commit violent acts  and he had such a great  mastery of the language  yeah  and just  everything  just the craftsmanship  you know  you know  it's weird to hear  a magician talk about  comedy craftsmanship  but I care about all that  and I  you know  I follow  you know  all of the greats  and he was just great 
[00:50:00]  and you guys are  experts at it  you know  everybody on the phone  with me here  and you just know  just the choice  of how he phrased it  and how he did it  was  yeah  genius  kind of genius  can't you have a porcelain sink  yeah  and then he had that famous  he had that famous line  he was like  I want to fuck you in the ass  with a Santa  with a Santa hat on  it was always  why  why with a Santa hat on  it was so  or literally  Otto would be minding  his own business  just saying something  and George would just  interrupt him  and go  you know  every time you talk 
[00:50:30]  this show sucks  I'm going to fuck you  in the ass  until there's blood  in your shoes  yeah  and I'm like  what a great image  that is  like that's a fucking poem  like to  fucking someone in the ass  is harsh  but until there's blood  in your shoes  that means it went  all the way down  your thighs  over your calves  and collected  in your shoes  took it to a whole new level  that's a harsh ass fucking  oh my god  David Copperfield's laughing  brutality  but he really understood that  he just knew how to write  brilliant material like that  and amazing lines  it's poetic 
[00:51:00]  in it's own  it's his own way  yeah  it becomes poetry  well thank you David  we appreciate it  you can see David  every night  at Hollywood Theater  at the MGM  oh don't do that  set that up  we might as well  7, 9 o'clock  I've actually worked  in that room  with David Tell  when you weren't there  it's an amazing space  I've seen David's show  a couple times  phenomenal  phenomenal show  alright  forget about that  you didn't call in  for a plug  we wanted to do it for you  no we know you didn't call in  for that  no worries  alright guys  see you at the show soon  alright thanks man

[01:00:00]  if I screw this up  I really am an idiot  don't be an idiot  go online to  I hate Steven Singer  dot com  today  tonight  20 years  of radio  dominance  is honored  and celebrated  two decades ago  radio's greatest  duo  started in  Long Island  and quickly  moved to Boston  to craft a career  who knew that  the mayor's family  is fans of  the Opie and Anthony  show  what's getting out  of hand 
[01:00:30]  well I think  we're going into  the gay zone  they moved  to New York  to completely  take over  the industry  this is  the Alderman  oh my god  that's horrible  oh no  oh my god  no  we're lit  we're lit  then revolutionized  the medium  on satellite radio  you said I don't  believe in the 
[01:01:00]  constitution  bye guys  bye Jess  B-Rock is a  temple  he is a  he's a destroyer  you make a little  mustache with baby  shit  the time has come  to learn from the  best  as for the first  time  Opie and Anthony  are being  unmasked  live from  Caroline's  on Broadway  in New York City  this is  Opie and Anthony  unmasked  and now your host  Ron Bennington 
[01:01:30]  on the  third time  on the  campaign  on the  journey  the  Oh, I love that. 
[01:02:00]  That was nice.  I thought you guys hated us.  You know, it was 20 years ago.  Shut the fuck up.  No, that was nice.  I thought they were bringing out the new Marvel characters for a summer blockbuster.  Yeah, what kind of intro is that?  I was like, is this about the moon landing?  Something very important?  But it is 20 years.  It's 20 years.  It sure is, Ron. 
[01:02:30]  It sure is.  Yeah.  Let me just seriously think back 20 years ago.  Would this be the dream where you guys got less than the dream, more than the dream?  Caroline's on Broadway?  Yeah, Caroline's on Broadway.  It's the dream.  Yeah.  By the way, I just want to point this out.  But Anthony ate so much backstage free food that it was frightening.  I did.  I had a pizza.  I had shrimp cocktail.  I had a galaman.  Ribs.  Ribs.  French fries. 
[01:03:00]  That's what happened.  Because I haven't eaten in three days.  I was on a bender.  It was the John Candy buffet he had.  It really was nice.  My God.  The commemorative Caroline's John Candy buffet, yes.  Women were crying.  Don't.  That's enough.  Stop it.  He's just hurting himself.  He's hurting himself.  But honestly, where you guys got in 20 years, is this more or less than what you would have thought?  What you wanted?  It's been a roller coaster.  Yeah.  On a graph, it would go.  And now we're sort of on the way up again, maybe. 
[01:03:30]  No, it's been a roller coaster ride.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  It's one of those situations where I think everything came into play at a certain time.  We were at the right time, the right talent, the right chemistry.  Ooh, the right talent.  I like that.  That's the one.  I like that.  Perfect amount of talent.  Yeah.  But something that becomes successful at one time can't at another. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  Like in the 90s, when we first started getting together and doing radio, I think that was  really a time that was great for what we were doing.  And now I think it's a lot more difficult because there's so many other options for entertainment.  You could literally see beheadings and a cute little kitten hitting a ball of yarn.  It's adorable.  All in the same sight.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think it was supposed to last this long, Ronnie.  Is that right? 
[01:04:30]  Well, in radio, you never get a chance to have a career this long.  So how long?  I'm kind of surprised by the longevity of it.  Well, how long was your radio career before you hooked up?  Want me to leave?  I started at 18 years old, so I did a good 10 beforehand.  Did you ever work with any other partners?  Well, there was Pete from around the corner.  I came in like Gorman, and he was Sergeant Barnes.  No one wants Platoon, you faggots. 
[01:05:00]  What's wrong with you?  Fuck.  Well, you know what happened?  Get on you.  I'm going to give this away for the radio audience.  Yeah.  The warm-up guy was so depressing that nobody wants to move now.  He threatened people with expulsion.  We're just trying to get the energy back in the room.  Thanks, Sam.  Sam Roberts, everyone.  I thought he was for the Hot 97 show after this. 
[01:05:30]  See?  Because you're half black.  But what half?  No one knows.  That's not his dick.  No, back in the day, I always worked with a radio crew, but I knew I wanted to get some  official people to stick around.  And then 20 years ago, in the summer, actually, Anthony's brother is the one responsible.  Yeah, Brother Joe is here. 
[01:06:00]  Where's Brother Joe?  The motherfucker.  I think...  He really has a huge responsibility in this disaster.  I think Brother Joe is expecting it to be the O.P., Anthony, and Joe show, though.  He was.  Whoopsie.  Sorry, Joe.  Yeah, Joe.  Yeah, I'll be right home.  Off to Boston.  Fuck you.  I kind of see him as being Doc in Back to the Future, you know?  If it wasn't for him, none of this would have happened.  None of this would have happened. 
[01:06:30]  He was the motivated one.  Yeah.  He really was.  I was at WBAB, one of the many homes of rock and rolls I worked at.  Ronnie understands that.  Sure.  And I was doing just a very easy bit.  It was the O.J. trial.  And I just wanted parody songs from all the local bands about the trial.  And one night, some lunatic is knocking on the back door over and over again.  And I said to one of my guys, I'm like, just see what they want.  There were always people coming and going. 
[01:07:00]  And it was Brother Joe.  And he would not give this cassette to anyone except me.  Just the cassette is enough right now.  We know how long ago it is.  It was a good single.  Right.  So I threw on 30 minutes of nonstop rock to go meet Brother Joe.  And he goes, hey, man, I think you might want to check this out from our band Rot Gut.  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, thanks.  And I was getting a ton of these songs. 
[01:07:30]  And I played it.  And it was the famous Gun Electric Shock O.J. with Anthony singing.  And it was by far the best song we got for that particular bit we were doing.  And then I'm like, hey, man, why don't you guys come in and perform it live?  Because everyone was requesting it every night, which is crazy, a parody song.  And they came in.  And then we just started screwing around.  And I knew that day they were going to take it to the top, no doubt in my mind.  And I walked around BAB the next day with this cassette of our first show together, playing it for people at BAB. 
[01:08:00]  And honestly, no one cared.  Yeah, right.  But I heard it.  I heard that we had some incredible chemistry.  And I knew that we could do something with it.  And this is something that you had been really looking for since then.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And when it happened, what was it that made you know this is different?  It was just we were finishing each other's thoughts and, you know.  Oh, seriously.  Gay marriage, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:08:30]  It's New York City.  Come on, New York.  Bring it to New York.  Come on, girls.  You know what?  I kind of deserved that.  You're right.  I forgot where we were.  Fuck.  I thought it was Barbara Walters.  I knew nothing about the business.  So I was just like, oh, this is great.  I'll get to do radio.  And within a month, you're making millions of dollars.  It's fantastic.  I was under the impression, seriously, Opie was at WBAB, a Long Island radio station, doing 
[01:09:00]  the seven to midnight shift, playing 90% music, hopping in when he could.  And I was convinced he had to be a millionaire.  This guy had to.  So he invites me over after we had, you know, done the show a few times, invites me over  to his house.  He's like, oh, I got a place in Northport, which is a very nice place in Long Island.  So I'm like, this is going to be like pulling up to Billy Joel's house.  And I drive up and look, and I'm looking at the address again and looking at the house. 
[01:09:30]  It's this shithole.  And he had half the shithole, the top of the shithole.  That's true.  I do have to add, you do remember what you used to look like, right?  Yeah, yeah.  That is true.  I wasn't going to show you my real house.  I wasn't always this gorgeous, ladies and gentlemen.  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  It was kind of a serial killer mullet thing going on.  But yeah, and then we went in there and I couldn't imagine the fact that you actually 
[01:10:00]  did radio but weren't rich.  And that he would talk about his program director and his GM and stuff and be like, this fucking  asshole won't let me do this.  And I'm like, why is he, this wasn't today, by the way, this was years ago.  And I'd be like, how can you, how can you complain about, this is fantastic, what a job.  I'm in a fucking 130 degree attic every day cutting sheet metal. 
[01:10:30]  And he's pissed because the fucking weenie that runs the place won't let him fucking  play a bit.  But then I realized very quickly, yes, he is an asshole.  The fucking program director sucks and he is being a prick.  It's actually lucky too that you, being a night guy like that, were able to bring somebody  in.  A lot of places won't even let you do that.  You know?  No, they were pretty cool.  I mean, I put everybody on the radio back then.  What was it?  But the won't let you was the, that was the let's do this. 
[01:11:00]  Right.  Whenever the management would come up and say, oh, they don't let you do this.  You're not allowed to do this.  We would figure out a way to do it and then make it sound like he wasn't clear enough.  Right.  On what he was saying.  No, there's no way.  You cannot play that bit about the Volkswagen commercial with the two gay guys and make  it sound like they're fucking each other in the ass at the end of the mic.  And we're like, oh, no, you'll never hear that.  And then we'd play it.  And he'd come in and went, oh, we thought you meant the other guy fucking the other guy 
[01:11:30]  in the ass.  Because that we understood.  That's worked out too because you guys never get fired.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Applaud pain and suffering.  Firing.  By the way, what was the name of that show that you guys were doing that?  What do you mean?  The first show that you did together.  Well, it was still my solo show.  So it was just the Nighttime Attitude. 
[01:12:00]  Seriously.  I love it.  You know we all got to have Nighttime Attitude shirts now.  Look out.  Oh, I made them back then.  Look out.  I made the Nighttime Attitude t-shirts.  Right.  But I, yeah.  Check out the empties, man.  So, no, I mean, then Ant started coming in once a week.  And I just knew.  And then I presented it to BAB.  Like, look, you know, I want to hire this guy.  And I want to move up. 
[01:12:30]  I was pretty cocky about it.  I'm like, I don't want to stay at night.  So I'm on afternoons or morning.  But they were set in their ways.  They had guys that basically were there forever.  And so I knew I had to start shopping our tapes around.  And I took him to IHOP.  Because I was making so much money.  It was an IHOP meeting.  And I, uh.  Were you still in Alder and all this?  Oh, my God.  This is great.  International.  International.  And I sat him down. 
[01:13:00]  I said, I got this vision.  We're going to do this.  And I had a pretty good career going for myself.  And I was home.  I'm from Long Island.  But I was like, no, man.  If they're not going to do this, we've got to go somewhere else.  And so I said, yeah, vision, pass the boysenberry.  Yeah.  So I literally sent out two tapes, one to Dallas and one to Boston.  And both stations wanted us immediately.  So then I told BAB that, you know, we were leaving.  And then their idea was to try to give Anthony my job. 
[01:13:30]  Radio is great.  When Opie said, radio is great.  Isn't it amazing?  Ronnie knows this.  Everyone runs this business.  I'm serious.  The general manager called me and said, look, we, I know you, you know, you know, we got  some little thing going on that you want to do.  But we, you're on the short list to take the seven to midnight slot.  And I'm just thinking, Anthony's not done. 
[01:14:00]  Meanwhile, I don't even know what the board does.  What the board does.  I'm just sitting there making dick jokes.  And I, no clue.  We would have had, we would have done job swap.  Yeah.  I would have ended up in attics.  Great.  But what a, I mean, the guy was just, uh, yeah, it was a scumbag move.  Because I, I went to him.  I'm like, we don't want to leave, you know, give us just a better slot and we'll do this.  There was also a time where they started taking bits from that we did on the seven to midnight 
[01:14:30]  shift and playing them on the morning show.  The morning Jack would be like, Hey, here it is.  And he'd start playing it.  And the fuck up thing was, I would listen to BAB.  So I would be at a job.  I'd be in the attic sweating.  The, the, the, by the way, the nails that nail in your shingles, they come right through  the plywood in the attic.  So when you have to get in a space this big, the nails go through your head.  So nails are going through my head.  I'm trying to cut out something with a little hand saw. 
[01:15:00]  And then I'm like, Oh, I'm on the radio.  I just hear me.  I'm hilarious.  And I'm still like, I'm going, when does this stop?  When are you on the radio?  But you're not working like a dog.  It was too.  We got him back.  Cause we had the goat shit in his box.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And his coffee cup.  Yeah.  We used to bring live animals on the radio back in the, back in the day when you could do  anything.  And by the way, just since you said the live animals on there, say hi to Bobo. 
[01:15:30]  He's here.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Live animal.  We, we almost made it 10 minutes without talking about him.  But, uh, we brought goats in and Ant got hit in the balls and, and this thing was shitting  all over the rug and we decided to have him shit in the morning guy's box for playing  our bits.  Yeah.  I wasn't going for a laugh.  I was just telling you a fact.  Yeah.  So going to Boston, easy decision or it was tough because you know how it is, Ron, you 
[01:16:00]  go to a new market, you don't know if you're going to hit or not.  I mean, you could be, you could have a huge audience in, in, uh, long Island, but is it  going to translate to, to Boston?  And, uh, also, um, we were older guys playing much younger and we were going to a very young  rock station, which scared the crap out of us.  Oh boy.  Did we have to fake it?  Yeah, man.  Hence all the dudes.  When you hear the old clips, what dude, what'd you do?  Dude, you're insane, dude, dude.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  So I was, I was frightened because we were playing, you know, Jethro Tull and Leonard Skinner.  Next thing you know, we're going up to Boston to play Nirvana early on.  Alice in Chains and Metallica.  And, uh, and our audience was like 12 to 22.  We, we, we would be like, all right, commercials coming.  Let's take some calls and try to get something for the show.  And it would always be like, play some corn.  This kid's 12.  I'm like, Anthony, maybe the Reagan impression's not going to work up here. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, maybe that's not washing.  Well, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down it.  Play some fucking butt trumpet.  Oh, God.  We got to tell Ron about the move real fast, though.  So we decide we're going to go to Boston and, uh, we don't have money.  I was doing okay.  And, and, and, uh, so we decided to rent a U-Haul and share the, the U-Haul.  Oh, shit.  So he, he pulls up to my, you know, crappy place that he, you know, told everyone about. 
[01:17:30]  And he, he left me like two feet in the U-Haul after telling me that there was plenty of room for my stuff.  You know why?  Opie told me, dude, I just need two feet on the back of the U-Haul.  I got nothing, dude.  It's cool.  So I ended up just smashing my stuff on the front lawn.  Yeah, on the front lawn.  It was kind of freeing.  I just broke everything that I was going to break.  It was this kind of cathartic, like, this is an all or nothing deal here.  We're making a big move.  There's a lot of residual shit in our lives.  Let's just throw it out and go full bore ahead to, to, to do this. 
[01:18:00]  I, I literally threw, I was driving my Dodge Aries K car.  No jealousy.  Uh, and, and I literally threw my tin knocking, my, my, uh, sheet metal tools out the window  on 95 when I was driving.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Cause I was like, I don't want to go back to do this.  You're burning bridges.  I'm burning, if I have to Sears has brand new snips, I'll buy them again. 
[01:18:30]  But, uh, it was one of those situations like this is what I'm doing and I, please, I hope  I make it.  I wish I, uh, I wish I threw my, Oh, thank, thank you for throwing your tools away.  Thank you for throwing your tools away.  I was going to tag your line there.  I wish I threw my girlfriend out on 95.  Oh, you and the fucking wife of mine.  Right.  We took, talk about throwing yourself into your job when you don't want to go home at  night, you will dedicate a lot of time to your occupation. 
[01:19:00]  But we, but we took care of that 10 years later, didn't we?  Fuck them bitches.  That's right.  Right guys.  Fuck.  Oh, I mean, teasing.  Of course, you look like a lovely girl.  So then we go to Boston and our, wow.  We get up to Boston, our first days with the program director that, you know, heard our  tape and loved us.  And we sit down for our first meeting and he's packing boxes going, Oh, you guys are going 
[01:19:30]  to be great.  You're going to be great.  You're going to be great.  And he's leaving for New York to go to Q10.  104.  104, right?  He hired us and immediately left.  And in radio, that's a really bad thing.  Because when they bring a new program director in, they want all their new people.  Sure.  And that's why we were stuck with Dave Douglas and always butted heads.  He wasn't our guy.  It was Ron Valeri who was, he was great to us, but he was packing our boxes.  He's like, you guys are going to be great up here.  And that's going to be great.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,  come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.  Right. 
[01:20:00]  So how long before you got heat there?  How long before you're like, this thing's working?  Oh, God, right away.  I mean, look at us.  Please.  Seriously.  There are a lot of people who think of you guys as Boston first above all else.  Honestly, that's a really good question.  I don't know.  It felt like it was working right away.  But we were replacing Liz Wilde, who had a huge audience.  And that's all we heard the first couple months.  Where's Liz?  Yeah, where's Liz?  Where's Liz?  We had like Dave Douglas, who was the program director. 
[01:20:30]  And Bruce Mittman was our GM.  And both of them, well, Bruce was really cool.  And he understood.  But he's a GM.  He doesn't really understand the talent end of radio and what you need to do.  Dave Douglas was supposed to understand the talent end and be like our liaison between management and stuff.  But he didn't know what the fuck was funny or good or entertaining.  He stunk on ice.  So they were giving us this advice.  And we were pretty new at that station.  So you kind of want to listen.  But then after a while, we were driving home one day.  And we realized we actually had a talk.  We said, look, let's just not fucking listen to these guys anymore. 
[01:21:00]  Well, let's just do whatever we think is best for us and our show.  And that's when things turned within months.  It just completely changed.  We started playing less music.  And Bruce would poke his head in and go, boys, what is this, a talk show?  And we're like, maybe.  Right.  Maybe it is.  Hey, Bruce, it's a talk show.  Yeah, now it is a fucking talk show.  It was on Route 9 on the way home.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:21:30]  I remember it like it was yesterday.  And we're like, why are we listening to these people?  You know, if we're going to fail at this, let's fail doing everything we think should be done for our show.  And not listen to Dave Douglas from fucking Iowa or wherever you thought.  Lincoln, Nebraska.  Go ahead, Lincoln, Nebraska.  Lincoln, Nebraska.  We're thinking of starting the show with the corn report.  But, you know, that is true.  Like, management always waits for the ratings and shit.  But when you're on the air, you know if something's working, particularly that new market when it starts to take off. 
[01:22:00]  There's very few feelings that you can have.  It's such a weird thing, too.  When you're in front of a live audience, you could instantly know when something's working.  But even on the air, you're talking into a mic.  You're talking to people you obviously don't even see.  But you know.  Right.  Like, as you're going back and forth and hitting on a subject, you know if it's working or not.  Without even getting that instant reaction from people.  So, yeah.  When we were listening to the PD and we're doing, we're holding back. 
[01:22:30]  We're not throwing shit out there that we knew.  We knew it.  So, we knew we just had to get out there and really fucking tear it up.  And, oh, boy.  And, oh, boy, did we.  Yeah.  Right.  Got our asses thrown right the fuck out of Boston.  They escorted us to the Connecticut state line and asked that we not return.  You bring up the famous April Fools.  Sure.  Famous April Fools.  Well, I mean, we've hinted at it for many years, but we purposely try to get fired.  Is that right?  I think most people know that now, yeah.  Yeah, we might as well say it now. 
[01:23:00]  We did everything we could up there.  We wanted more again.  I went to Bruce Mip and I'm like, look, obviously we're kicking ass.  I think we were the first radio show that was beating BCN up there.  And that was just unheard of because AF had a horrible signal in the Boston metro.  And we were still able to beat them.  I mean, we were killing it.  And we were making still no money.  They gave us a few cute raises.  The one at the Chinese restaurant.  We went to a Chinese buffet.  And Bruce Mip and it was during renegotiation.  And we didn't have an agent or anything.  We're like, we can handle this. 
[01:23:30]  And Bruce Mip, I guess he saw it in a movie.  He slid a piece of paper upside down over to me.  And I'm like, I know what I'm supposed to do.  I saw the movie.  And I looked and I just started cracking up laughing.  It was not a fraction of what me and Opie during the drive to the Chinese place thought we should have been getting.  So I'm like, what the fuck is this?  We honestly thought they were going to offer us like twice as much.  And it was great to see Anthony have some balls because back then. 
[01:24:00]  Balls?  It was a sense of humor at that point.  That was the funniest joke ever.  Back then I took a lot of the lead on that stuff.  But Anthony, when he laughed, I'm like, yes, awesome.  Opie had been in the business for so long that he knew the business, at least up to that point.  I had no clue.  So anything that wasn't tin knocking in an attic, I thought was fantastic.  So whenever the boss would give a shit, I'd be like, okay, I'm sorry.  Whatever it takes to stay doing this. 
[01:24:30]  And Opie's like, no, fuck that guy.  We're going to tell him.  We're going to fucking...  Ixnay on the Elton.  We're going on the air tomorrow and telling him to go fuck themselves.  It was great because it was in a different place.  I was petrified.  I'm like, don't worry.  I got this.  It'll be all right.  You guys got...  You wanted to get fired because you had offers?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We want you guys to come to New York.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I was like, wow, New York.  Big Apple.  Yeah.  Actually, before...  If you don't mind, before you get to that, there's another moment that happened up there, 
[01:25:00]  which it amazed me.  We were doing very well.  Dave Douglas was there for a few months.  He pulls me aside and he goes, why, Anthony?  I'm like, what are you talking about, why, Anthony?  Are you listening to the same show that we're doing?  We have great chemistry and all.  But he just didn't understand that a guy could come out of nowhere and do as well as Anthony  was doing on the radio.  He wanted slappy or wappy to get into the spot.  Stunt boy.  He was feeling me out to see maybe I could split this up and get a quote, quote, please, 
[01:25:30]  a real radio guy in there that grew up in the business.  And I'm like, what do you mean, why, Anthony?  The divide and conquer thing is huge in radio.  Oh, they did a lot up there.  And at that point, I knew, fuck him, fuck this place.  We got to do our own thing.  Yeah.  Well, that's the thing that when you bring somebody who's not trained in broadcasting,  they don't know the rules already.  Right.  So you got all kinds of shit wide open to you. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And management doesn't know what to do with them.  Right.  It's like, oh, he doesn't know the rules.  I tell him this.  He goes off in a whole nother direction.  Radio is so awful that a lot of times, and this is true, and it's happened, somebody  will say, I got an idea for your show.  And you're like, oh, that sounds great.  And then you found out that that PD stole it from San Francisco or Chicago.  And all of a sudden, you're doing a fucking bit that isn't yours.  Right.  Yeah.  And you're like, never again will I believe you.  Yep.  You know, they're awful that way. 
[01:26:30]  So you guys wanted out of Boston, even though you're very, very popular.  We didn't really want out.  We just knew we had no choice once again.  It was like the BAB thing all over again.  Right.  I mean, management, these radio stations, they just don't see the vision.  To this day, it amazes me.  You know, some of the same stuff is happening at SiriusXM, but we'll leave that for another  time.  They had a morning show.  They had a morning show that was locked into morning.  Hold on.  I just found that we're off the air right now.  Oh, no.  I don't know what just happened.  Did they pull the plug?  Did they pull the plug?  The morning show was locked in over at AAF in Boston, so we knew we weren't never getting 
[01:27:00]  that morning show.  Dave loved the morning show because it was a typical, you know, safe morning show.  Remember all the gigs we did?  I mean, we were by far the number one show at the station, but Dave just would put us  in these.  Remember the live gigs?  He put us in the worst spot possible as people are still coming in.  All right.  Hillman's going to intro Alice in Chains, and you guys are going to intro the dirt clumps  from Vegas.  Right.  Like, why?  What happened?  Oh, it was just unbelievable. 
[01:27:30]  But we want to intro.  So, I mean, we did everything we could there.  I went to Bruce, said, we want more.  At that point, we felt like we should be syndicated.  We wanted to be heard in New York again because we're from New York, and we already did pretty  well down there at BAB.  But we're talking two years into the career now?  Yeah.  Three.  Three.  Yeah.  We did three years up there, a little more.  Three years is pretty early normally to ask to be syndicated.  It was a different time, Ronnie.  But, you know, the other thing, that's when I first found out about you guys when you were 
[01:28:00]  up there.  Yeah.  I saw some picture in the trade, and there were lines.  Right.  And that's, you know how fucking rare that is to be able to pull off where you're the  draw.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, when you're playing music, you know.  That was our Demented World CD.  Yeah.  And I remember that story.  We put out a CD that did very well up there, and we're going to the Springfield Mall for  one of these signings.  They had a signing all over the area.  And me and Anne are walking in the mall, and there's this line that's wrapping around 
[01:28:30]  the whole mall.  And I'm like, God, Anne, who else is here?  I swear to God.  We really thought there was some, like, promotion, or they were selling something, anything.  Like, we're like, oh, man, there's a lot of people here.  This must be something.  And then it was fucking, we went to the front of that line.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, they started clapping and cheering for us.  And I looked at Anne, like, what the hell is this about?  We had no idea.  You're the wonders, boys.  You're the wonders.  And then the shyster that put out the CD was in the corner selling posters for, like, 
[01:29:00]  two bucks a piece, counting the money, like, to himself.  We're like, how much do we get of that?  Yeah, yeah, don't worry about it.  We'll come out in the water.  God.  Oh, the frigging pieces of shit we had to deal with.  Oh, God.  We still do.  Sam Roberts, everybody.  He was trying to.  E-Rock's laughing because I didn't say E-Rock.  Enjoy yourself, but not too much.  Sam Roberts doing the warm-up.  So. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  So.  You set out to get fired by a really amusing idea of an April Fool's joke saying a man was  dead.  Hey, the mayor of Boston's dead.  Well, we know it was wrong now, Rod.  The mayor's dead.  Huh?  You knew that they would get pissed off at you.  You just didn't know how pissed off. 
[01:30:00]  Well, yeah, just to back up slightly, at that point, as we're trying to stay up there and  get more for ourselves, whether it's mornings or syndication, all of a sudden, New York  starts calling us, and they were really interested in us.  And me and Ant snuck down there for an interview.  Yeah, we had a meeting with New York before any of the.  Even though you had a contract that said you couldn't get out of it.  Yeah, and by the way, even meeting with somebody else is new, new, new when you're under contract.  Especially back then, but who did we meet with?  Was it Scott Herman back then?  I don't know. 
[01:30:30]  I guess it doesn't matter too much.  But we came down, we had this interview, and they hinted, like, oh, man, we really love  you, but it's too bad you're in a contract.  Yeah, we can fix that.  It was like we're winking at us.  So it wasn't as brave as you would think.  Right.  Because we had that in our back pocket.  But we had quite the padded little safety net.  Right.  Don't worry.  We went up there, and I'm like, man, what do we do?  If we get out of this contract, they're going to come a-calling, you know?  And then I'm pacing my apartment, and I call Anthony. 
[01:31:00]  He's like, I think I woke you up, right?  Yeah, well, it was probably, like, noon.  Because I finally had the idea.  I'm like, this is what we're going to do, and we're doing it today.  Did you hear my wife yelling at me in the background?  Yeah.  I'm like, this is what we're doing.  You know, I go, you know how everyone does April Fool's pranks every year?  We're going to do the ultimate one, and, you know, we're going to either get a lot of heat,  or we're going to get fired.  And I was very excited.  And he was just like, yeah, it sounds great.  I'll see you three.  That's exactly how he sounds. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It sounds great.  And we went in, and I remember, you know, we talked about it a little bit, and I looked at it.  I'm like, are we going to do this, or what?  And then we kind of nodded each other.  Yeah, here we go.  And then all of a sudden, you know, I got one of my good friends that has a great radio voice to call in as a news guy.  And we did it.  We freaking did it.  And then we looked at each other like, here we go.  And before the show was over, there were headlines.  The TVs were lit up with what we were doing. 
[01:32:00]  Lit up.  Yeah, we were looking up at the TV monitors just going, oh, oh, this is lit up.  I think this has some heat.  And they said the mayor was dead.  And then the timing was terrible because he was on a flight from Florida to New York at the exact time we did that.  So nobody could get in touch with him.  So they were trying to get a comment.  It's like, well, he's incommunicado because he's dead.  Like, oh, shit. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that was.  So you guys are, all right, we did what we want, but you still felt a little freaky.  Oh, we were a little, yeah.  You weren't sure exactly how it was going to work out.  But we knew the timing.  I was back at Sears.  We knew the timing was right to at least give it a shot.  And then Dave Douglas walked in, and he's like, you're going to tell everyone this is an April Fool's prank.  I want you to do this immediately.  And going back to what Ann said earlier, we were like, yeah, don't worry about it.  Don't worry.  Next break, you know. 
[01:33:00]  And we never did.  Never did.  Show ended.  All right, we'll see you tomorrow.  What?  And then he's outside the door like, guys, I thought we talked about this.  Oh, I thought you meant tomorrow.  I'm like, we'll tell him tomorrow.  Oh, see, we'll do it.  But, I mean, I don't know.  If you're going to do the April Fool's prank like that, we figured you've got to go all in.  I hate when I hear about radio stations.  They do an April Fool's prank, and within 30 seconds, they're telling everyone it's an April Fool's prank.  Yeah, they go, you're eating moon rocks.  Come through bars. 
[01:33:30]  It doesn't have the same.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Yeah, because if you do something like that, then you don't get fired.  Right.  Maybe they had a point, Ronnie.  But that, I mean, the following day, you're in front page of every paper, and you're basically.  It's that bittersweet moment in radio where you're looking at all the press you're getting,  and you're like, this is the greatest thing ever.  Uh-oh.  Am I going to get fired, though?  It's that teeter-totter.  You're like, oh, boy.  How far is it going to go one way, because we'd been in trouble at AAF before, but management 
[01:34:00]  was like, all right, look, we've got to reprimand you in the press and stuff, and then behind  the scenes, a great job, you know?  We'll suspend you for a week.  Here's your pay.  You're suspended.  But this one was different.  This one was, uh-oh, because management, above management, got into it.  Like, corporate people started showing up.  We need to, um, we're going to look into everyone that knew about this, so we could. 
[01:34:30]  And this is a woman that came, and she was dressed in that Hillary Clinton clothes that  takes away every bit of femininity.  And she's like, we're going to get this settled, get you right back on the air as quick as we  can.  I'm like, oh, shit.  We are so fucked.  We are never getting back on the air again.  Her name was Susan McDonald, for the people that care out there.  You know her, Ronnie?  You know her deal with her?  But, uh, yeah, Dave.  Whoa. 
[01:35:00]  Dave, uh, Dave Douglas called us, got us off the air immediately, and said, you know,  we've got to deal with this.  And, uh, wow.  Wow.  You started talking to New York right away, though?  Did you?  Uh, well, I mean, first of all, the press followed us around.  They did the 10 o'clock news on my front lawn.  You could see me peeking out the window going, wow, what's going on out there?  Right.  They start, they actually started the news for my phone.  This is great.  Right.  Look at all the attention.  They're banging on the door, trying to get my, uh, comment. 
[01:35:30]  I knew I had to shut my mouth.  And, uh, wow.  It was kind of scary.  That was when we got the call, though, from, uh, Gollum.  Gollum from, uh, oh, no, Bob Eatman, our agent.  Sorry.  Uh, he, he thought he would take the opportunity to call us and, uh, start kind of negotiating  a deal with New York and stuff.  Because we obviously, the old piece of paper slide wasn't working very well.  And then the, that was the NEW move.  Now, we're coming to.  There were, there were a few bumps in the road there, too, because then we're like, all 
[01:36:00]  right, look, we don't have a contract anymore.  And they're like, well, great.  Do you realize what you just did?  Damaged goods.  They weren't sure if they wanted to touch us at that point.  And then we had to fly down to Washington to meet, um, what's his name there?  Yeah, that guy.  We, we, we packed, we packed for a nice weekend in Washington.  They flew us down and got us on a flight an hour later back to Boston.  He was one of the, like, the, the huge bigwigs in, uh, Viacom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Infinity. 
[01:36:30]  We all know his name and now we can't remember.  And now it doesn't even matter.  But, uh, we thought, yeah, we thought, oh, we're going to go out to dinner with this guy.  We'll woo him.  It's going to be great.  He's going to hire us.  Some steaks.  We, we fly into DC.  We take a, a car ride for hours into, like, the mountains.  I don't even know where the hell this was.  It was like a, an evil lair for this guy.  And, uh, we get there.  We sit.  The secretary goes, all right, wait.  So we're sitting in the waiting room.  Finally get into this guy.  He sits down and goes, well, you, uh, you boys ever going to think of doing anything like that again? 
[01:37:00]  We're like, no, no, not nothing like that.  He goes, he goes, okay, I'll put the word out.  You guys are good.  And then we were leaving.  Right.  Like, where's the dinner?  Where's the fucking?  We're back on a plane, like, shell-shocked.  Yeah.  But I guess he just needed to see that we didn't have the horns and tail.  Well, in hindsight, he should have spent a little more time with you, too.  Probably.  You probably should have asked a few follow-up questions.  Well, Ronnie, I thought he meant the mayor dead thing. 
[01:37:30]  Right.  We'll never do that one again.  Not the fucking in church thing.  Right.  Yeah.  He should have spent a little more time, maybe brought in a psychologist.  Yeah.  Learn about, I don't know, an addiction to chaos.  Because the N.E.W. years were insane.  Amazing.  You were there for that, Ronnie.  Yeah.  You were there.  The show, whatever that show was, never ended.  It went on through our show, through your show.  It just didn't stop the debauchery that went on in that place. 
[01:38:00]  I think some things were illegal, I don't think, or at least very much against company  policy.  Yeah.  That was, I would say that was the golden age of the show.  My God.  Yeah.  Well, there was.  There were no rules for us back then.  But, I just wonder, what was the motivation to work that far on the edge every day?  It was that the reward for doing something like that was so big then. 
[01:38:30]  You didn't get in trouble if your ratings were that big.  This shit gave you ratings.  So, the reward for getting that kind of attention made you want to go, well, what else can we  do that's over here?  And then, before you know it, you're like, human sacrifice.  We could do this.  Yeah.  Well, we got so crazy.  But, it started, once again, we were there three or four months and we're not moving the  needle whatsoever.  And, N.E.W. was a really famous rock station. 
[01:39:00]  We heard, shut up and play the music.  Right.  And, they weren't even allowing us to play music that was even cool that anyone liked because  they owned other properties in New York.  So, it was, remember?  Yeah, it was terrible.  So, we started dropping records and then, once again, on the way home, we were commuting  together back then on the Long Island Expressway.  We had the same exact talk we had in Boston.  We're like, we're four months in.  They might give us two more months.  We got to just throw everything away and just do our thing again.  Right.  Because, I think we were a little scared at first because here we are in New York and 
[01:39:30]  we know our friends and family are listening.  That's the end of the line.  It's the number one market.  And, this is it.  Your one chance.  These legendary DJs are walking around, Scott Muni and stuff.  We were very intimidated at first.  So, we threw everything away and just said, let's just be ourselves on the radio.  And, all of a sudden, I remember a trend came out.  You get ratings every month.  And, there was that slight tick up.  And, then, that just motivated the hell out of us.  Yeah, let's stick a phone up a girl's vagina now.  Right.  We got to do that. 
[01:40:00]  We got to keep it going.  It was like a drug.  It was.  It was like a fucking drug.  And, we used to say back then, we would do these over-the-top events to get people talking,  to get them to listen.  And, then, hopefully, you know, in between those big stunts, we had, you know, things to say.  And, hopefully, we made people laugh.  Yeah, that they thought we were entertaining, yeah.  Or, make them think or whatever.  They can't do that shit every day.  No, no, no.  And, then, it just turned into a runaway train.  I mean, we started getting known for that.  And, we just always felt like, all right, what's the next big, huge thing we're going to do? 
[01:40:30]  And, we just kept trying to top ourselves.  And, in all fairness, management sat us down a bunch and said, guys, it's happening.  You don't have to do that anymore.  But, unfortunately, we just didn't listen.  You almost got to the point.  There was an adrenaline rush to it, as well.  You almost got to the point where you know what a serial killer feels like.  Like, killing someone and going, this is so much fun.  But, I think I'm going to be in trouble.  But, you get this rush of just knowing that you're really doing something that's going to just make people wince.  But, while that's happening, and to me, I brought this up in the air before talking about Opie. 
[01:41:00]  But, to be really a strong broadcaster is a guy that's open to find somebody like Anthony who's raw and ready to come in.  The other thing that I always thought you did that was genius is you got the best comics in the country to come on, but also the right comics.  I mean, the comics that you ran through that show are basically running comedy today. 
[01:41:30]  I have something to say about that.  We hated comedians on the radio.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  For real.  I mean, they would bring guys on our show in Boston.  We didn't have a choice for a while there.  And, they all would come in and do their shtick.  And, me and Ann would look at each other like, if you're a funny guy, why can't you just be funny with us?  Just hang out and talk.  Right.  And, you could tell they're going into their bits.  And, we're like, yuck.  And, then when we came to New York, same thing was happening.  We just didn't, we didn't want them.  You know?  And, we finally were pretty much saying, no, we're not going to do the comedy thing, which is, comedian thing, which is tough in New York. 
[01:42:00]  And, that obviously leads to Jim Norton, who, yeah.  Yeah.  We should probably bring Jim Norton.  I mean, I, I mean, I, I personally give him all the credit.  Because, before that, we had, our eyes were closed.  We're like, we're not doing this.  And, except for, you know, a few guys, like Brian Regan, and Andrew Dice Clay, because Dice heard that we were doing an amazing Dice impression, Anthony's impression, obviously. 
[01:42:30]  And, club sort of Kenny heard it, and had Dice call in, like, you've got to hear this guy doing you.  And, then Dice was the one that said, you've got to talk to my opener.  He's nuts.  And, we had Jim Norton on the phone one day, and he was talking about a girl shitting on him right out of the box.  Yeah.  And.  He shit out of her box?  And, we.  Ew.  And, we've talked about this one over the years, too.  He didn't have the greatest five minutes on our, the first time he called the show, but there was something there.  And, I'm like, man, we've got to get this guy in. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, his eyes are darting back and forth.  Right.  And, we're like, this guy's perfect.  Let's not waste any more time.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Come on, Jim Norton.  Oh, I have AIDS. 
[01:43:30]  What's that?  Now I have AIDS.  Again.  That was very kind, by the way.  I bombed horribly on the show.  That was nice of you to say.  That was terrible.  And, she tinkled on me.  Nothing.  Jimmy, what about you?  Were you thinking about radio at all before you?  No, never.  Never.  Came in?  No, not at all.  I mean, it was, these guys brought me in.  I had never had any inclination to do it.  And, Opie told me, like, keep coming in, man.  You're funny.  We'll get you paid.  And, everything he said that they were going to do, he did.  And, I was like, who's the snowman in your life? 
[01:44:00]  Exactly.  Why does he blink a lot?  Does he watch surf?  Did you feel that at all, or were you funny?  No, not at all.  We were so set and, like, on that frigging rocket that was the show that I didn't care  who the fuck he brought back onto the show at that point.  And, that was the warmth I walked into.  Jim Norton.  I don't give a fuck who we bring onto this.  But, was it just, Opie, just your thing, or did you and Ant sit down and talk about it? 
[01:44:30]  I don't know.  We weren't really talking much back then.  Is that right?  You know, I mean, it's obvious to a lot of people, we've had our ups and downs and stuff.  That was a weird time where I had just told my wife to go fuck herself.  And, his girlfriend at the time and my ex-wife were still very good friends.  So, put us in the weirdest fucking position where, you know, he's getting shit in his  ear from his girlfriend about my wife, and I'm telling him about the wife, and no one 
[01:45:00]  wanted to hear, no one gives a shit.  It was terrible.  Fuck that, cunt.  We, uh...  If I may quote Otto, cunt!  I'm going to check your...  Because, you've hinted at this a couple of times.  I don't think you're that fond of her, though.  I think, uh...  You know, it was a weird kind of love, Ron.  It was strange.  But, the bottom line, though, is if you look at 20 years, the times we've really butted heads 
[01:45:30]  is pretty slim for 20 years.  But, it's also impossible not to, because...  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  To do radio, like, you've all been on that car trip with your friends, imagine that it  never ends.  It's every day for 20 years.  Driving back and forth to Florida, bitching at each other.  I think part of it, uh...  Yeah, me and Ant, there was a time, I mean, to be completely honest, we probably didn't  talk off-air for a year.  We didn't even talk when the mics were off. 
[01:46:00]  And, as I sit here many years later, I don't even know why anymore.  It was just, like, probably the pressure of trying to keep...  Ant does?  I don't know.  If he does, he can say it.  Who said that?  Is my ex-wife here?  Who?  I really, I mean...  You really don't know what it is, though.  Nothing, nothing, like, nothing major.  It was just like a...  It was just...  Our lives so changed when...  Or, at least mine did right away when we got to New York.  And then his started changing, too.  And we knew we had the radio show. 
[01:46:30]  Like, that never went away.  There wasn't a part of, like, wow, we can't do radio anymore.  That was always a given.  But our personal lives started changing, and we weren't doing all the other things we did.  You know, it was me, him, his girlfriend, and my wife.  We'd go out to dinner.  We'd go on vacations.  We'd do...  It was fucking, like, you know...  We were always together.  And then all of a sudden, you know, she had to go.  And it just mixed the whole thing up.  And then my girlfriend was thinking, oh, you're going to do just the same thing, Anthony. 
[01:47:00]  Well, you should have told her that isn't going to happen.  Oh.  We missed out on so much pussy we could have.  Oh, if we knew we were going to ditch both of them, we'd have been fucking back in 95.  Oh, fuck.  But it was the perfect time to bring Jimmy on.  That's the only reason I'm bringing this up.  It was sort of a way to kind of...  Right, a buffer, yeah.  Kind of a...  I mean, we...  It's like adopting a child while the marriage is going back.  Yeah.  This will help our marriage. 
[01:47:30]  Let's adopt this kid.  I was writing letters to my...  They're like two fathers, Grandma.  Fucking...  Fucking Barnes and...  Another Platoon reference, you fucking assholes.  But, uh...  Watch it.  The timing was right.  The timing was right, though, between us not talking a lot back then,  and then knowing we wanted to bring someone else on,  just to kind of mix it up a little bit.  And, uh...  Yeah.  It worked out.  Jimmy, you should talk about the first, um...  Show.  Do you remember Fran?  Yeah, I was...  Because that's when you killed it. 
[01:48:00]  With the keyboard.  And we just knew it was going to work.  She was...  I was...  What was her name?  Frantic Fran.  And, uh...  Dice brought me on.  And I had a show at Rascals that night at, like, 8 o'clock in South Jersey.  And I'm like...  I came on.  I said nothing for the first two hours.  I was just scared.  The best part of the show.  Yeah, it really was.  I laughed at the right places.  Dice went, huh?  And I was like, yes, sir.  And then, in the last hour, I just started, I think, to attack this older woman.  And, uh...  Mock her.  And make fun of her.  And, uh...  It was really funny.  And she was such an easy target. 
[01:48:30]  And I took advantage of that.  And I wound up being funny that day for the last hour.  Because I said, are you going to leave a radio show to go do a fucking jersey gig?  You idiot.  I just realized the bigger picture is to be on the radio.  So, if it had not been for that moment, I probably never would have come back.  So, a few of you on the message boards...  Oh, she didn't come here.  But, yeah, it was a defining moment, for sure.  It really was.  And then, Jimmy led to bringing everybody else in.  I can't, I can't, and I can't really take credit for that. 
[01:49:00]  Well, who are the guys that have always worked well with the show?  Oh, God.  You gotta go...  Patrice, obviously.  Patrice.  He was fantastic.  Rich Voss.  I wish they would have switched places.  Oh!  No.  No.  Wow.  No.  Oh, my.  It's not.  Bonnie couldn't take a dick that big.  Oh! 
[01:49:30]  It just doesn't end, people.  Wow.  Yeah, it's really weird to feel so uncomfortable and agree at the same time.  I'm trying to think of the early guys.  It was Rich.  It was Patrice.  Well, not even Patrice yet, really.  No, it was Voss.  Who were the real early guys in AEW?  Yeah, Colin.  Was Bobby coming in at that point?  No.  No.  Bobby, I remember me, you and Bobby.  Me, Opie, and Bobby were talking outside of my building after we got kicked off.  And that was one of the first times you guys met him.  I'll give you a name.  Jim Brewer coming on.  Of course.  It was yours.  Always, always.  Did you spin this? 
[01:50:00]  But when this happened, Jimmy, were you thinking, you know, as a guy who's a stand-up and you're  traveling around, are you thinking that this radio thing was temporary for you, or?  I still remember the first girl who sucked my dick because I was on the radio.  I'm still in touch with her.  He uses that term girl so loosely.  Yeah, it was a really weird-looking chick named Antonia. 
[01:50:30]  No, it was magic, man.  I hate to say it's so corny, but I couldn't believe that I had some fans, like people that  came out.  And again, these guys stuck up for comedians.  Like, I did Rascals one time, and they're like, hey, if you just keep bringing some extra  people, we'll take care of you.  And I fucking packed the place out, and they gave me a $100 bonus, and they went on the  air, and Opie was really hard-fucking, we're not going to take care of you guys if you  don't take care of our guys.  And they shamed them into sending me $500 more.  That was the first time I understood the power of the radio show. 
[01:51:00]  Did you ever get a piece of that?  I didn't.  No, I didn't get a skin flint.  I didn't get my envelope.  It might owe me $100.  But I mean, they defended comics, and they stuck up for me immediately and made me feel like  I was a member of the team.  It sounds really corny, but it made me feel like I've never felt that way anywhere before.  They're so good when they just come on as themselves.  We've had a cavalcade of comics that have come on and tried to do their act, and unfortunately, 
[01:51:30]  they usually end up killing themselves.  Oh, come on now.  We're on the stage at Caroline's.  You can't take a little fucking morbid humor?  We had nothing to do with Richard Jennings' death.  Nothing, I swear.  No, he came on, and look, the guy was the nicest guy, very...  Actually, he was a very funny comic, but he didn't work with our show.  He didn't work with our show.  But it's a good example of, and I hate to use him, but he's a great example of what doesn't work on the show. 
[01:52:00]  And that was doing your act, and we ended up putting him behind the closed door with a little strip of glass, like a classroom door.  And we gave him a microphone, and we called it the prison visit appearance, where he'd have to talk through the glass, and he didn't get the joke.  No.  Yeah.  But Pauly Shore killed for us.  He took...  Oh.  Well, here's another one.  There's certain comedians that work, and a lot of it has to do with just being naturally funny more than clever or whatever. 
[01:52:30]  Talk about any circumstance.  Just talk about your life and be able to jump in with a story, make it compelling and entertaining and funny.  That's a comic to me.  And handle it, not go across the line, which takes us to Paul Mercurio.  Oh, boy.  Firing number two.  The famous Sex for Sam.  Right.  In hindsight, I don't even think he could be blamed that much, because we were all on that roller coaster where you tried, and he had been listening to the show and knew what the comics did and what we did and knew it was, you push it to the furthest extent you can, and you're going to get famous. 
[01:53:00]  It's an amazing trick.  I do want to add one thing.  We always pick guys, though, that kind of knew exactly where the line was.  Right.  Our guys would go out there, you know, they understood to push it as far as they can, but what is going to actually get us fired in this particular bit?  And I mean, I'm not blaming him, but I don't think he fully understood it that day. 
[01:53:30]  It was Sex for Sam.  You go around various locations in New York City, landmarks, you have sex, there's a spotter with you who was the comedians and whatnot, and they would watch and say, all right, he's fucking her.  That's three points.  He's fucking her at the Hard Rock Cafe.  That's four points.  Oh, he dicked her in the ass.  It's a two-point conversion.  Like, this is how this game worked.  So we gave all the contestants a list of places in New York, Empire State Building, World Trade Center, Statue of Liberty, all these places. 
[01:54:00]  And church.  And Opie was like.  I added church at the last minute.  He added church on the list.  Behind Ken Stevens' back, by the way.  It was just so we could read the list and go, church, that's crazy.  Because once again, that gets people talking.  Right.  You're in your car going, what?  This might happen at a church?  But it's what Opie said also.  We knew that the people we were sending out, they're not going to a church.  There's plenty of places on the list.  You know, Macy's.  Hey, go fucking Macy's.  It's not a church.  But the church on the list was outrageous enough, and we thought it would stop just by saying church on the list. 
[01:54:30]  I think it's kind of amazing that you guys think it's okay to fuck in a Macy's.  Plenty of shit to wipe your dick on.  I mean, it seems like there was quite a few places that you could get fired.  We really just had.  That's it.  That's what I'm looking for.  We really just had.  Yeah, I believe that's okay.  Right.  That is true.  Oh, man.  I remember somebody in the studio going, don't go in the church. 
[01:55:00]  Don't go in the church.  Get away from the church.  We always had an inkling whenever we were going to get fired or in big trouble for something that we knew it was coming.  It wasn't so stupid that we were like, we didn't even see that we knew.  But it was that, let's take the chance.  It's a gamble.  I got to tell you, I saw Paul Mercurio, and they said he was at a church, and we all kind of looked at each other.  And it was one of those moments, again, do you or what?  Click.  Hey, Paul, what's up?  I'm at St. Pats, and he's doing the two-point conversion in the ass. 
[01:55:30]  Right.  Like, what?  St. Patsy.  It could have been anything.  The Scientology Church.  Right.  You pick the holiest of holy Catholic churches.  But it's another one of those moments.  You just knew, man, this could be a problem.  And we just, it could be.  But we just looked at each other.  We call him Mr. Perceptive.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's crazy, obviously. 
[01:56:00]  At that day, you're in no trouble yet, but did you think it was coming because of the church?  Well, oh, yeah.  Yeah, we knew shit was coming.  We knew what was, it was called the slow build.  Right.  If something got some news, and you got a blurb somewhere, we knew it was going to get traction.  And boy, could we have used a big news story that week.  Nothing happened.  It was a slow news day.  Nothing except sex at St. Pats Cathedral.  But Paul Mercurio, there still was a chance to maybe get out of it, because there was 
[01:56:30]  a guard there that day who said, just get out of here.  He didn't want to deal with it, obviously.  Right.  And Paul decided to grant that a little bit.  He was going to, yeah.  And he said, get out of here, why?  I won't get out of here.  He might have said, where's your God now?  And then, so the police, so the guy calls the police, and they arrest the couple, and  Paul is like, aren't you going to arrest me, or something to that effect?  Yeah, he kind of wanted to get arrested.  He actually took a cab to the police station, so he could get arrested.  Arrest me.  Some would say Paul Mercurio couldn't get arrested. 
[01:57:00]  And I didn't think the show would get fired, because I had never been through a firing.  Had I been through one before, I never would have been stupid enough to okay that.  Yeah, yeah.  I had never been fired before.  In hindsight, you look, because we all have dump buttons in front of us, and you're able  to dump out of whatever was just said, and seven seconds back.  How long before this shit really hit the fan? 
[01:57:30]  Immediately.  Yeah, yeah.  It was very quickly.  Oh, boy did that roll.  I mean, by 10 o'clock, CNN was all over it.  I think it was CNN.  Back to the train, back to the train, and then Bill O'Donohue, the head of the Catholic  League, he got involved, and then Giuliani had something to say about it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But, I mean, it was also the culture radio back then, and we didn't see the signs, and  we didn't see things were changing.  Oh, I saw it.  Like I said earlier, if you had ratings in radio, you just didn't get fired, as long 
[01:58:00]  as you didn't break the FCC rules.  So I'm like, man, we're killing it up and down the East Coast.  They're not going to fire us.  Yeah, in radio, you fucked up.  Right.  You're like, you fucked up, and it's like, yeah, I'm at the next level.  This is great.  Right.  But, man, was I wrong.  Yeah.  I mean, the culture obviously was changing right in front of our eyes, and we ignored the  signs.  And you guys were literally the last show to do that kind of radio.  Yeah, because then they put the hammer down.  No one else was able to do anything after that, as far as the outrageous bits and stunts 
[01:58:30]  and things like that.  Man, did they clamp down on it.  No, it's...  We ruined the industry.  Yeah.  Very happy.  It really was this Apocalypse Now version.  Just explosions all around.  We probably should have...  Who's in charge?  You ate you?  Right.  Apocalypse.  I think we were supposed...  I think we were supposed to be fired a week or two before that, though, that we got some 
[01:59:00]  heat for our Buffalo gig.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of heat.  Yeah.  And we weren't even on the radio.  TNA for ONA.  What a great title.  Were you there?  Oh, shit.  Oh, he's like, no, I was, but she's with me.  TNA for ONA.  That was great.  And it's odd how management didn't seem to see the writing on the wall.  There was girls fucking themselves with zucchinis on the beach.  Right.  On the beach.  Oh, we thought you meant cucumbers were bad. 
[01:59:30]  But that was a Buffalo beach.  Yeah, a Buffalo beach.  A little more helpful.  You know?  It's a little different from St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Yeah, that was...  The only church that the Pope visits when he goes to America.  The Pope goes there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pope broke on...  Pope broke on church.  So, when the shit hit...  How long had you been doing radio with them, Jimmy?  I want to say around...  I did the Garden with Dice in 2000. 
[02:00:00]  So, it was right around there I started going in very...  The Olive Garden!  I didn't say that, Andrew.  I didn't laugh at it.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Of course, Dice.  We were all there.  We loved it.  It was right around there.  So, it was...  Like, I see pictures from 2001 or whatever that E-Rock posts.  And I'm like, I was on the show every day by then.  So, it was right around that time.  So, it was a pretty short period of time that you got to the school run.  It was just enough time to feel like, wow, I could succeed. 
[02:00:30]  And then it was just pulled out from under me.  Five months into a two-year lease.  I think you were...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was living with Florentine and his girlfriend paying $300 a month in Jersey.  And I'm like, I'll just stay there.  And then I move into a $2,200 a month apartment in New York.  Mr. Big Shit.  Five months later, we're fucking canceled.  That was...  Sorry, Jim.  Yeah.  What were you going to say?  Well...  Oops.  The beauty of it is most of you got paid while you were off the air. 
[02:01:00]  I was happy for those guys.  You know...  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's right.  They paid every dollar.  Clear Channel Broadcasting, who was the main competitor for Infinity Broadcasting, Viacom,  who we worked for, they wanted us to do mornings.  Right away.  Right away.  They're like, you're fired?  Fuck it, because Howard was doing mornings at Infinity Viacom.  So they needed some competition. 
[02:01:30]  They knew we could have...  We might not have beat him, but we could have taken a nice chunk out of his ratings.  So Infinity said, oh, really?  No.  We're going to keep paying you.  You're not fired.  Your show's canceled.  So we'll keep paying you for two fucking years to keep you off the air.  It's nice for the first six months.  And it's nice until you realize all your friends still work.  Right.  And you're just sitting there watching TV or, you know, going on a vacation alone. 
[02:02:00]  There's nothing to do.  Well, he's French, but I know French.  Yeah, you know, it's funny.  My money had just doubled.  They had doubled my salary.  They doubled my salary, and the paperwork hadn't gone through yet.  Oh, it was...  Oh, did I get fucked good.  They should have put me in St. Pat's.  I took it in the ass really well.  Two-point conversion.  But the point being, I mean, we were ready to continue working, and we would have been paid and, you know, doing our thing. 
[02:02:30]  You would have gladly jumped in and stopped the morning at the day of...  In a second.  We actually went to negotiate with them to stop getting paid.  Right.  We wanted them to stop paying us.  Right.  Real, it's an insane amount of money to stop paying us just so we could work.  We wanted to do radio.  They wouldn't let us.  Because once you got that thing, you're saying, oh, here's a bid I could do.  Here's the news coming in. 
[02:03:00]  There's nothing more frustrating than being an off-the-air jock when you're looking at the news.  You're looking at things that are happening, and you just...  Me and Opie were doing the two-man show on the phone.  Jesus Christ.  Dude, you see that story about the guy and his dick and the...  Yeah, it was...  Nothing.  And there's no Twitter or Facebook back then.  I mean, when, you know, we couldn't...  Yes, you could.  We couldn't communicate with anybody.  There was no Twitter, Facebook, or nothing.  But that's great.  That's usually the way he talks to his girlfriends. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  How he loves that.  How he loves...  Yeah, bust my balls about that all the time.  I love it.  Oh, I care.  But that's...  But that is true.  Like, now you'd probably start podcasting or some shit.  You'd be able to at least keep in touch with everybody and, you know, rally the troops.  How about you guys?  Did you all say, we're coming back no matter what?  Wow.  You were calling Jimmy?  For a while, we weren't really sure, man. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  It was one of the most depressing times.  We got the call that we were fired.  We were all three of us together.  We were walking down Broadway, I think.  By the Starbucks.  67th and Columbus.  That's right.  From Starbucks.  Jimmy tells that story.  Yeah, we got the call from Bobby Eatman.  No, Bobby got the call.  And he just goes, okay, okay, they're canceling the show.  Okay.  Real calm.  Like, that was common.  And we're all sitting in the back and behind your house, and you're discussing it.  You guys are talking about your options.  And I'm just sitting there going, I have to pay rent. 
[02:04:30]  This is terrible.  And I didn't know anything about canceling the show.  I didn't think that could ever happen.  It's that unknown, like, you don't know.  This is the end of your career.  It's just, we've had so many end of our careers.  And it's scary.  And I heard from people back then who would say to me, no, you don't understand.  They're never going to work.  This is no coming back.  Yeah.  We were blacklisted in broadcast radio.  Because the Clear Channel thing went away.  They moved on.  Yeah, they moved on.  Obviously, they're not going to wait two fucking years. 
[02:05:00]  We sat out two years, three months.  And then satellite radio came calling.  There was literally, because there was nothing with the planet Earth anymore.  No, we had to go into space.  We needed space-borne hardware.  Yes.  To filter our hardware.  Was it an option at the time, or did you feel like, what?  No, it sucked.  It was so depressing to think, like, because at that time, especially, satellite, people  were like, what?  What is that? 
[02:05:30]  We used to go, when we drive around, we'd look to try to see those shark fin antennas  on people's cars to see how many people had satellite.  And we're like, oh, no, no, no, no, no one had it.  I remember calling you going, I saw 10 today.  And you're like, where were you?  I'm like, oh, rush hour traffic going into the Lincoln Tunnel.  I saw 10 antennas.  This could be viable.  It was depressing, man, to know where we were.  And now we're going to start from literally ground zoos.  We could say fuck to three people. 
[02:06:00]  This is great.  Well, because then XM hired us.  And Hugh Pinero, at the time, I got to say, he didn't really believe in the show.  I don't even know why he hired us.  Because he came in, and he basically told us our first meeting, I just want to let you  know, I don't like you guys at all.  I don't like you, but I understand what you do, but I hear you have an audience.  Oh, great.  Thanks.  How you fucking reacted to an asshole like that, scumbag?  You signed on the dotted line. 
[02:06:30]  And then they put us on a premium channel.  You had to pay an extra, what?  What was it?  Oh, it was terrible.  We were doing the numbers going, we might be talking to 5,000 people.  We used to talk to millions.  Yeah.  I remember when it was 11,000, you gave me that number in Boston, and you're like, well,  it's up to 11,000.  We pumped them up, Jim.  Sorry.  We pumped them up.  Pumping up those numbers.  Yeah.  And then the whole dynamic of the show had to change, because when you used to throw something 
[02:07:00]  out there, people would call in that just casually got your show, and they'd be like,  hey, you guys suck.  We hate you.  Fuck you.  When you're getting people that are paying a premium price to listen, everyone has the  same call.  Dude, it's great.  When you were at AEW, they're all people that already listen.  Yeah.  So we liked the people that didn't know who we were.  We could get new listeners that way.  It was so hard to build an audience on Satellite, because you're preaching to the converted.  Do you guys remember we did the tour of Satellite? 
[02:07:30]  Before it started, we went to different markets just to promote that we were going to be on  Satellite Radio, and it was like, oh, it's going to be a long road back, man, because  people came out in like Philly and Boston, but a few other markets, it was like fucking  small little crowds in a bar.  It was depressing, for real, man.  Really depressing.  Man.  And then weirdly enough.  Thank you for listening still.  Thank you.  These are the converted here. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Right.  But then you got a call back from Terrestrial Radio.  Yeah, that was kind of cool.  And then weirdly, XM said you could do both.  Yeah, that was exhausting.  Which was really strange.  Oh, my God.  That whole, yeah.  The problem was that, yeah, now regular radio wants us back because they realize, oh,  okay, they don't have devil's, you know, horns.  They're going to behave now.  No, they really didn't have a choice.  Howard left.  Yeah, I guess.  They brought Diamond David Lee Roth on to do morning.  Boozy, boozy, bop, diddy, bop. 
[02:08:30]  Hey, let's do morning radio.  Who's your bop, diddy, boozy, bop.  No one wanted to listen to him.  He brought palm trees in.  Yeah.  He actually brought in palm trees.  I want palm trees and sand in the studio.  I wish they all could be.  All right.  We can get him out.  Fuck out of here.  Yeah.  So they threw him out.  And I'm like, what do we got?  Oh, Hopey and Anthony are free.  The same company that fired us. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  But then the two companies, once again, they were butting heads and they both want to control  the show.  And it was kind of a disaster, to be honest with you.  Yes.  We had to go from the FM studio.  They wouldn't even agree on one studio for us.  So we had to suffer and go from K-Rock studio.  We had to do the walkover.  In the middle of a show.  In the middle of the show.  I mean, we walked from, we walked about two blocks up 57th Street, regardless of the weather. 
[02:09:30]  There were times where it was like an Arctic vortex coming through.  And we had to walk and try to like, hey, there's a cab.  Yeah.  Isn't that funny, people?  There's a cab.  There's nothing to talk about for two blocks.  Hey, there's a cake.  Oh.  Oh.  Who would do that?  Awkward.  You know, I'm glad they admitted it. 
[02:10:00]  Talk.  How much time between stepping on the cake and the outrage?  That had to be the longest amount of time.  Seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years.  It went viral seven years later.  Everyone was cool with it at the time because they understood the relationship we had with Andrew.  We were taking care of the guy, you know, every day.  Homeless guy.  And we almost felt like he was part of our weird crew. 
[02:10:30]  You know, we have a million of these types of guys.  We could stomp on his cake, which was the only thing he had to eat.  But it was just...  Yeah, I guess you're right.  Yeah.  But that's how things have changed so much that people who now don't listen to you get clips of the show on the internet and can get pissed off.  It happens to the comics all the time.  I mean, this drags down careers.  Yeah.  Taking out of context now. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  There have been a couple of times we've said something on the air and Jimmy will say, like, should we pull that from the replay?  And it's like, I don't even think about it because I have no sense whatsoever.  Yeah.  I'm like, no, why?  And he's like, because taken out of context, just that audio clip and replayed, it's hard to defend.  You know, you could defend it in context, but no one cares about context.  Stop saying context.  And it's very...  No, but...  No, but...  Contextually.  It is, and it's very rare because you hear the stuff that goes out over the air. 
[02:11:30]  So imagine the few things that go...  It's very, very rare that will happen.  But I'm like, I would rather take the air on the side of caution with certain little catchphrases or certain things.  And I'm like, again, taken as just a line.  Nobody wants to hear it.  And you don't have faith that anybody will defend you.  That's a guy that's paying a lot more than $2,300 a month now.  Well, no, that's in prostitutes. 
[02:12:00]  This is a weird thing.  And this actually shows you what happens with the O&A show.  Who could believe that in any situation, Jim Norton is the conservative one?  The voice of reason.  Yeah.  This doesn't happen anywhere.  Well, Jimmy's got a story to tell about that as well.  So we sit out two years, three months.  We're back on satellite radio.  We almost got fired a month in.  And Jimmy was the one like, what the fuck are we doing? 
[02:12:30]  I remember we were at a diner after that show.  We're like, we've got to make some drastic changes.  We're going right back to where we were.  Explain what you almost got fired for.  It was the naked girls passed out outside the building.  It was the naked girls.  I thought it was Homeless Charlie.  No, no, no.  This is way...  We were back a month.  It was around Thanksgiving of 04.  And we had, we still had the Jägermeister machine and we still had the wiffle ball bat.  Oh, geez.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a recipe for a womb injury. 
[02:13:00]  The wiffle ball bat challenge was we had a wiffle ball bat in the studio and any porn star  girls or actress or, you know, just a waif off the street.  We would take the wiffle ball bat, roll a condom over it and see how far she could put it in her vagina.  The fat end was the champ.  But, but, and then we'd mark it with a Sharpie and then the next girl that would come in, we'd replace it back in the last case.  And the next girl that would come in, we'd say, and see who could take the most.  Anthony, was this in a church or, um... 
[02:13:30]  Ron, don't be crude.  Yeah.  Don't forget...  But it was the same condom over and over.  Yeah.  Don't forget we had two categories.  Right.  The front and the back.  We had girls...  We had a back winner as well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So...  So we get back...  I didn't know what that strange rubber thing that was rolled on the bat was.  I had no idea.  I thought it was a party balloon.  I'm like, yay!  Yay!  What's this useful, uh, useless, horrible...  Useful.  Useful.  But, uh, Jimmy, like, knocked some sense into us. 
[02:14:00]  What are we doing?  Because everyone was drunk.  The girls were naked.  I fucked one of them in Ron and Fess's office.  You guys had an office.  Woo!  It's true.  You know?  I don't even know if it was your office yet.  It was that room that became your office.  It was...  I fucked a girl in there.  And then the other one was so drunk, they took her out half-naked through the lobby onto 57th Street.  Where she proceeded to puke into the street.  Yeah, she did. 
[02:14:30]  This...  This solves it...  For months, we looked for fish.  We were just...  What did the...  Oh, so...  Oh, wait.  I'm the fucked up one.  I didn't want to make sure.  I'm the bad guy.  That's me now?  Good.  Yeah.  So we had to get rid of the wiffle ball bat and the Jaeger machine.  And the Jaegermeister machine.  Jaegermeister, excuse me.  And that was all Jim Norton.  He's like, we got to stop.  You guys just sat up over two years.  You almost should not be able to be fired from the satellite radio. 
[02:15:00]  I know.  Right.  And how many times did you come close?  That's what we thought.  Homeless Charlie was a biggie.  Yeah.  We thought satellite radio, perfect medium to bring a homeless guy up and just ramble his shit.  Like, on regular terrestrial radio, you had to worry about what he was going to say, like,  shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock, suck a motherfucker, tits wise.  But this way, it was like, he could say all that and just go up.  But what he was saying, even without cursing, was the bad thing.  He wanted to fuck the first lady in the ass. 
[02:15:30]  He wanted to fuck the Queen of England.  Mother Teresa was also getting fucked.  Condoleezza Rice.  Condoleezza Rice needed his dick.  And it was all this, the way he was talking.  And again, it gets picked up by the news.  And they start running like, oh, he wants to rape the first lady.  And this kind of shit is being put out on radio.  And we're like, can we just do a music show and play the 60s?  Let's just play Windy.  And then Reverend Al got involved. 
[02:16:00]  This is obscure.  Reverend Al got involved.  Yeah, and that scared the company.  And they made a backroom deal.  So you know it was legit.  Right.  Was that right?  Yeah.  He came in with his briefcase holding it.  Right.  Trying to collect evidence.  Talking to the combination line.  I am outraged.  I have a California raisin head.  But that's the thing of out of context. 
[02:16:30]  If you're listening to the show, you're hearing a homeless guy ramble.  Like we hear in New York every day.  But if you read the news, it sounded like he did it.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah, of course.  And he actually did it.  And you are giving it credibility.  You're the one that's going, I need people to hear this.  No, it's satellite radio is a perfect medium to hear the rambling insanity of a homeless person.  But they didn't get that again.  Well, no, Eric Logan got it.  Because I think XM at the time definitely wanted us fired. 
[02:17:00]  Definitely.  And Eric Logan stepped in and said, I'll control these guys.  You sat out a month, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But not on regular radio.  Regular radio was fine with the bit because it didn't happen on their airwaves.  That was great because we just left early.  Oh, it was wonderful.  Walk over, schmuck over.  I'm going back.  Right.  But I got to credit Elo.  He was the one that stepped in and made sure they didn't fire us.  And they want, here's what, regular radio, someone said that someone at regular radio pushed that because it made it on Breitbart.  And then this was when the Sirius XM merger was happening.  And the thing was like, could this endanger the merger? 
[02:17:30]  And that was why the higher-ups at XM started to panic.  Then board members started going, get rid of them.  Threaten our deal.  Harvey Holmes, Charlie, was a funny guy.  He was just one of the funny human beings.  One guy, he just wanted to rape the first lady.  Exactly.  He's a pisser.  Yeah, a real hoot.  You're still doing mornings, though, over in Terrestrial.  What had changed while you guys were away?  Because it seemed like a different world. 
[02:18:00]  They pretty much handcuffed us.  We couldn't do anything we used to do.  And I remember we sat with Tom Chieson and we're like, this is not going to work.  We need a meeting with the lawyers.  So he's like, okay.  And we remember the meeting with the lawyers.  Oh, yeah.  Thrill of my life, right?  Trying to convince them they got to loosen up and let us do some of these things.  And then the whole meeting was about why we can't do any of this stuff anymore.  And I knew we were pretty fucked at that.  Yeah, early on you would meet with lawyers and sometimes they would say, okay, you need 
[02:18:30]  to do this to make this work.  You need to do this, this, this, and then you could do this.  And it got to the point where the lawyers were just saying, no, you can't do this.  Right.  Can we figure it?  No, you just can't do this.  And then when they handed out the pamphlet, words hurt.  Words hurt.  And if anyone has a copy of that, please, we want to read that on the air again.  I can't find a copy.  Well, we got in trouble for reading it on the air.  Because it was a thing. 
[02:19:00]  And it said on the memo, do not read on air.  Not for on air.  Oh, well.  What are you going to do?  Words hurt.  That means read it, right?  How many times were they dumping out during your show?  Wow.  Well, we made that into a bit.  If Louis C.K. was in a lot, because Louis would not say the seven, but he didn't understand  that you can't say diarrhea in the mouth.  Right.  It's a regular radio.  So guys like Louis would get dumped all the time because his idea of fixing it just didn't  work on regular radio.  Al Dukes.  I just read a tweet from Al Dukes.  He was with Boomer now, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he was talking about Otto, Otto and George, and saying that whenever. 
[02:19:30]  Yes, of course.  Fantastic.  Poor Otto.  I banana my Otto.  And he was talking about whenever Otto would come on, how many times he would have to hit  the dump button.  Yeah.  And a lot of people don't understand it's not just the seven dirty words.  It's the context of what you're saying.  So yeah, diarrhea in the mouth.  You can't say that.  Yeah.  I mean, sure, it's sexy, but.  And it would just get dumped out.  We were constantly getting dumped.  I think also the Janet Jackson tit thing did a lot. 
[02:20:00]  That changed the FCC rules for everything.  Because just because that was TV, the rules were the same with television and radio as  far as language goes.  So they made it so that every incidence was now hundreds of thousands of dollars instead  of like the 10 or 20,000, which sounds like a lot of money, but for a company, it was the  cost of doing business.  So now it became like if you got in trouble by the FCC for saying something bad, it crippled  a company.  $350,000 per offense.  Per offense, per market. 
[02:20:30]  So if you're syndicated in 10 markets, it's $3 million.  Did my math?  Yeah.  Thank you.  $3,500,000.  Where'd that come from?  So at this case, you already kind of know.  Hands tied.  Yeah.  Hands tied.  Go on.  Hands tied.  Can't do your show.  Can't do it?  Yeah.  But you figure we'll just keep going with this.  We had to change the show up a little bit, which I think we did over the years.  It's called, you know, we're like, oh, the show's grown over the years.  We've gotten a bit older. 
[02:21:00]  But it was out of necessity.  You just couldn't do the show we used to do.  So it's either stop doing any show or kind of evolve and be able to talk a little more  about the news, be a little more sarcastic about what we see in the world.  Social media helped.  I mean, that's, you know, a cavalcade of assholes on a daily fucking basis that can be just talked  about.  And you love the fight with them.  You love the battle.  I can't tell you the joy I get out of fighting about guns and race on Twitter. 
[02:21:30]  It's fantastic.  And I would say the same thing to the next audience that's coming in in a little while.  Hot 97.  I'm getting the fuck out of Dodge.  I always know it's going to be a great show the next morning when I see you at one o'clock  in the morning.  Anthony going, fuck you.  Not in these neighborhoods.  It doesn't happen.  It's not right. 
[02:22:00]  It's going to be a long show.  But that's joy for you.  That's joy.  You have a good time.  There is this joy, the anger, the feeling that I have a commitment to something which  disappears in the morning.  See, that's...  It's not really that important to me.  Don't give a shit.  Last night it was everything.  See, there's this thing that's happening.  Like, you guys talked about it one time.  You were tense. 
[02:22:30]  But I don't think that you could have made different lifestyle changes than you have in  the last couple of years.  And I never bring up anyone's personal life.  But, Opie, you married, like, a nice person and a real person.  And you're...  You've changed.  No, you've changed quite a bit.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's a family guy.  I've always been a family guy.  I don't know. 
[02:23:00]  My dad used to tell me, why don't you ever bring the nice part of your personality on  the radio?  And I was just like, it was boring.  It really was to me.  And he goes, you know, he loved the radio show.  He's no longer with us.  But he's like, man, you know, they really should see that other side of him.  But my dad's dead, too.  I can make the jokes.  My father hears me talking about trannies and wishes he was.  Well, because we're being honest, my father's Catholic and he's still pissed over St. 
[02:23:30]  Pass.  Still, I have to...  I pay for it more than you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  But that is a huge change for you.  And I think it's taken away some of the, how do I burn this shit house down?  Yeah.  You know?  Because I do think that chaotic thing was always there the last couple of years.  I was responsible for a lot of that, sure.  Everyone knows it.  But yeah, I've calmed down. 
[02:24:00]  I'm a happier person.  You know?  There's nothing there.  It's just whatever.  No, it's a nice thing.  It's a nice thing.  I'm in a good place.  You know, we started out as guys in our early 20s.  But very similar, you know, from Long Island, just with our girls and stuff.  And our lives have changed in drastically different directions.  But the show has always been there as the show.  It doesn't matter what's going on in each other's lives. 
[02:24:30]  We can get on that mic and fucking do a show.  And it's the Opie and Anthony show.  And you know it.  You just know it.  It's amazing.  It's a lot of fun.  Just let me know when we have like a minute left in the broadcast.  Well, okay.  Oh, no.  Secret.  You got a poem?  No, no, I'm not a spaggot.  You know. 
[02:25:00]  Either that or he's going to get us all fired.  Jimmy, it's the same for you, too.  Because the thing that I always look at with you is with your career, do you ever think,  oh, I could have went in some different directions and just hanging out doing radio.  Oh, coattail hopper Norton.  Yeah.  Boy.  Colin, the second we got fired, Colin's like, what's this weight on my back?  It is amazing, but I'm like a fucking deer tick. 
[02:25:30]  With a...  Yeah.  A crab would have been better.  But no, I don't look at this as a kind of a temporary...  Like, I love it.  Like, I genuinely love the gig.  And it's not something I look at like, oh, I want to someday do my own...  Like, I just love...  I get to hang out with my dumb friends for fucking four hours a day and goof off.  Like, it really is a great job.  We get to say whatever we want. 
[02:26:00]  Sirius doesn't fuck with us with content.  They're really...  Honestly, we complain sometimes, but they never come to us and go, don't say that.  Like, they let us pretty much, content-wise, do what we want to do.  And it's like, you don't get that anywhere.  That is the truth.  That should be said.  But it's also true, and I'm not going to...  They don't know how to make a poster, but...  Yeah, I'm not...  Oh, wait till you see what you're in store for.  Ooh!  Ooh!  Celebrating 20 years with pictures from 20 months.  They didn't know it was years. 
[02:26:30]  Holy...  20 months.  But I don't know another show that could have added one of the great comedians of their generation  to the show, and I think it's always amazing...  Oh, thank you.  ...that you're on that show.  I'm shocked.  I'm shocked that a guy who does TV specials and Tonight Shows and all late-night programming  and still will come in at 6 o'clock in the morning and do this without...  I'm stunned.  I've never seen...  And it's like that Hollywood bullshit.  I've never seen... 
[02:27:00]  But I've never seen someone as dedicated to a show as Jimmy.  He's there every time.  And there are days where it could be like, oh, I'm taking the red eye in.  If I was taking the red eye in and was getting in at 6 o'clock in the morning, I'd go home.  I'd sleep.  He's like, I'll be there at 6.30.  It's called...  It's called knowing how replaceable you are, so making sure I am there. 
[02:27:30]  And, Anthony, we're all aware that you'll sleep in at the drop of a hat.  Sleep sure there, Ronnie.  Oh, and sick again?  I sure love that 3 to 7 spot in the afternoon drive.  Another head cold?  It's so hard to be late at 3 in the afternoon.  And if you can't be up by 3, there's a bigger problem than just getting up to 3.  I know, Opie, you've got something you want to read to us.  Well, I made... 
[02:28:00]  This is going to be like an Oprah moment, if you don't mind.  Sure.  I made Don Wicklund get cupcakes for everybody because he was going to do that stupid cupcake thing.  Oh, Don.  So where's Don Wicklund?  I made him go out and get 350 cupcakes.  It's true.  Because they had this stupid idea of having, like, big-name celebrities that we don't know at all 
[02:28:30]  come on stage and give us cupcakes during this.  Yeah, that would have been natural.  How many did he get, 350?  Oh, yeah, I made him go out and get 300 and whatever, 350 cupcakes.  300 fucking...  And thanks to Roland, there are six left.  You know...  Oh, am I going to pay for that joke?  Oh, yeah.  I just glanced out.  Huh?  And so, to me, if I think of you guys, I always think of black girl Douglas. 
[02:29:00]  There he is.  Where's Earl?  Oh, stand up, Earl.  Earl!  Earl!  Man, black doesn't crack.  Yeah.  Earl looks exactly the same.  It's scary.  He's a time traveler.  He really is.  He's finally black girl from the future.  Wow.  He's wearing the exact same thing I saw him in last time I saw him.  Oh, my God.  Earl.  That's amazing.  He had a life.  We should mention our staff.  We're working with the best staff... 
[02:29:30]  Available.  Really?  It pains me to say that.  And obviously, we've had some...  It pains me to say that.  It really does, but...  Backhanded insult.  We've had some great staff over the years, but right now, we've got a solid staff.  I just want to mention, like, Club Soda Kenny and Sal, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  Sam, Roland, Troy, Travis.  Who are we forgetting? 
[02:30:00]  Yes.  Who are we forgetting?  Our interns, who...  They both names start with A.  Whatever.  But they do a really nice job for us.  They're doing a great job for us.  Did you mention Sam Roberts?  Yes.  Yeah, Sam, who...  What a dynamo he is on stage, huh?  He's phenomenal.  Yeah, it was a phenomenal opening.  That really was.  Come on, guys.  Clap.  Where are the cupcakes, Don?  They're coming.  They're outside. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, they're outside.  Oh, all right.  They're outside.  Great.  You know what to probably eat in them.  Oh, my God.  Ladies and gentlemen,  20 years minus...  Minus the times that they were fired  and kept off the air.  Oh, thank you so much.  And, uh...  The O&A show.

Anthony, the Razor  roller board scooter,  these damn things  are all over Manhattan. 
[02:40:30]  It's the hottest product  this summer.  You probably have seen  them by now.  I defy anybody  to say they have not  seen one of these.  They are very popular  with kids, teens,  college students,  even people commuting  on these things,  Opie.  They're pretty cool,  and I know these guys  that had these little  hop-up kits for them  so you could hop it up  so it'll go fast enough  to really get dangerous.  Sleek looking.  Supping it up.  And just a piecer to ride.  Get the hell out of here  with that thing now! 
[02:41:00]  Christ!  Visit one of their stores  or go online.  He's bringing back  a memory.  If you live on Long Island,  man.  Every neighborhood  had the kid.  Had the kid  with the stupid  moped or the motor  or the mini bike.  Yeah, with dad raking,  he'd be like,  me, me, me.  Ah, slow down!  Carry on.  All day. 
[02:41:30]  Long Island memories, man.  He was also the guy  that would stop  in the middle  while you're playing  a stickball game.  and he'd say,  me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  And he'd get off the bike  and he'd go,  oh no,  it's the moped guy  got off his bike.  Give me the bat,  faggot.  Hear that cigarette  dangling from his mouth?  Pitch the ball,  faggot, pitch it.  Take a swing. 
[02:42:00]  And he would look horrible  and he'd look horrible,  swing it.  And he'd be like,  pitch it good  for a kicker ass.  This game is for fairies.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  And he would take off.  He would take off.  He'd always have a dribble  of snot in his nose,  but he couldn't say nothing  because he was too tough.  Because he'd beat you up.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Another Long Island memory.  Thank you, Jim.  Two brothers in jail.  Me, me, me, me, me.  The Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  Give him a call

[02:43:30]  He's going to give them  a goddamn heart attack.  Call the cops, Henry.  Call the cops.  I'm calling the cops,  you son of a bitch.  All right.  Calm down, Chester.  Calm down. 
[02:44:00]  I, B, stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Sit.  Stop it.  The choke collar.  They got him by the choke chain.  I can't even do it. 
[02:44:30]  Jesus Christ.  Knock it off.  He's going to die.  Call the goddamn police, though.  He doesn't even live here.  I want him arrested.  This is ridiculous.  He doesn't even have a license.  He just left the studio. 
[02:45:00]  Come back.  Oh, Mike.  You're killing me.  You are effing killing me.  Mike, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  I can't believe this.  I got to run to the bathroom.  This guy's amazing.  Brewer's hilarious.  He's hilarious.  You're the man, Brewer.  God bless.  God bless all of you.  All right, Mike.  I can't frigging breathe, okay? 
[02:45:30]  The Brewer is spitting up.  Oh, my God.  You got to do that on stage.  Yeah, that's great.  The visual is even better, man.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  What the hell is going on?

[02:46:30]  Hey!  Hey!  I'm calling the cops, goddammit, on each and every one of you.  My dog has been under the goddamn bed for three hours now,  and if you give him a heart attack,  what's the roof, you son of a bitch?  If my roof goes on fire, do you understand me?  That's Long Island, though, man. 
[02:47:00]  That's Long Island.  In all those neighborhoods,  they'd have their own fireworks display right in the middle of the street.  And the poor one dog...  The screaming old lady, though.  Everyone had him.  One family left that one dog alone.  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  You are killing me with the dog...  The choke collar. 
[02:47:30]  That's all it would sound like.  Chris, what's going on?  Have some water.  Dude, you've got to get him out of there.  I'm standing in the middle of the street laughing my effing figs off.  I'm going to get clean screens by minivans.  Well, he's puking right now for playing the dog.  Oh, man.  I can't even breathe.  What are we in the middle of?  The Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  I totally forgot.  It's the Razor Rollerboard Scooter. 
[02:48:00]  ONA's 20th Anniversary Retrospective.  Retrospective.  Iraq, what are you doing?  Oh, no.  Okay.  Sorry.  How much cinnamon does he do?  Wait.  How many times is he going to get off the hook?  I know.  Wait.  You can't grab the water at first.  He can do whatever he wants.  Yeah, I don't want to see if I get sick, man.  Hold the water.  All right.  What's the cinnamon challenge?  You've got to give it to him if he really needs it.  We can't have it.  Let me do that.  Take a teaspoon. 
[02:48:30]  It's supposed to be a tablespoon.  Just give him a teaspoon.  All right.  Let's see what this does.  We're not going to use the little sprinkle.  That will take nine days to get it on the front.  Nine days.  Is this the biggest one you got?  Yeah.  Just make it.  You'd probably do a bigger one.  It would be.  Make it heaping.  That's why I wanted a bigger spoon.  You don't have a bigger spoon?  All right.  Just make that one heaping.  Pour it on there.  So this isn't even the real cinnamon challenge.  That's enough.  All right.  I know.  He's treating it like it's ice cream. 
[02:49:00]  All right.  Cheers.  All right.  I'm going to fucking blow this in your face like a fucking voodoo woman.  All right.  Come here.  Come here, Pookie.  I'm going to just open your mouth.  Dave from Philly, the UPS line.  It's that Linger Longer line.  Ready?  One, two, three.  Go.  Okay.  Fuck it off.  E-Rock is attempting...  You all right, E-Rock? 
[02:49:30]  Smoke is coming out of him.  He's smoking.  What is he doing?  You all right, E-Rock?  How is it?  He's like that old wrestler.  Water, you asshole.  Holy shit.  A whole cloud came out.  Drink a little water.  Inhale.  Breathe slow.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Breathe slow.  Through your nose, fuckface.  You all right?  He's too.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Breathe water.  Drink water. 
[02:50:00]  This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  He's going to drink water.  Drink water.  Drink water.  Drink a little water.  Something just came out of his forehead.  You okay?  Water just came out of his forehead.  E-Rock.  Water.  Water.  It smells so nice in here, though.  It smells like cinnamon toast.  It smells like Christmas.  It was a cloud of cinnamon that went across the room.  E-Rock.  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right.  Shut up!  Holy shit!  E-Rock, we just want to make sure you're okay. 
[02:50:30]  You can't breathe.  We can breathe.  He's breathing hard.  He's here.  Just slowly.  Very slowly.  You gotta do it.  Slowly.  It's like mustard gas.  Take a little bit of water.  Just a little in your mouth.  A little in your mouth.  Little sit.  Little sit.  Someone get him a napkin.  Are you puking?  We'll just gargle and spit the water out.  Yeah, gargle and spit the water out.  Very slow breaths.  No, breathe like you...  And, uh...  You have to breathe like you're giving birth. 
[02:51:00]  Like that.  Holy shit.  Dude, that was fucking bad.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Take a little sip of water.  No.  Cinnamon.  Cinnamon.  That?  Yeah.  That's cinnamon.  That's cinnamon.  Alright, you're okay.  It turns reddish when mixed with blood.  No, go ahead.  Just...  That's not a blood.  That's actually a blood clot. 
[02:51:30]  I think that's part of your liver.  Your face is all red from like...  You okay?  Just breathe.  Wow, man.  Just breathe.  What the fuck?  Is there stuff...  I never heard of that.  What does that do?  I can't...  Do you want to do it again?  What's the matter?  Let him...  Let him...  Let him do it.  Shut up.  Nasty, man.  That is bad.  Wow.  Slow breath, C-Rock.  Yeah.  Just slow.  Oh, he's throwing up. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, he's throwing up.  Oh, all right.  Wow.  See, this is where I wish Flea Man was our intern.  Because we would have him do this, and if anything happened, no one would care.  You all right, E-Rock?  What a weird reaction that is, though.  I would never have fucked this up.  See, even the water.  He can't drink water because the cinnamon keeps going down.  But you know what?  This is the weird thing, is that this cures cancer, if you do this once.  Shut up!  You'll always...  No, seriously.  You'll be immune to cancer. 
[02:52:30]  Shut up!  E-Rock, yeah, just stay like that.  Just keep breathing.  Yeah.  Breathe through your ears.  Any more blood coming out?  Where was it coming from?  Your throat?  Artery.  Dude, it was a hunk of blood.  Take his pulse.  See how fast it's going.  I bet it's going, like, really fast.  No one knows how to take a pulse either in here?  Jesus Christ. 
[02:53:00]  Fucking clowns.  Just the slightest bit of water, E-Rock.  No one wants fingerprints on a dead body.  Not a lot.  I think you're past it.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll be...  All right, get another spoonful.  Oh, piece of an ass.  Because nobody wants fingerprints on a dead body.  Wow.  Nobody wants to be CSI'd for...  Well, once again, it doesn't work.  You can't do that. 
[02:53:30]  You can't eat cinnamon.  Wait, you know what?  Before we decide...  Did he really try it out?  Shut the fuck up.  Yes, he did.  I just want to make sure.  Just easy on the water.  That's good.  Just make sure you take us some breaths.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did it... 
[02:54:00]  What...  Can you talk yet?  What did it feel like?  Yeah.  Like, how long in your mouth?  How long?  It was a split second.  What happened?  But then the reaction took a long time.  Hold on.  What we saw was a dust of cinnamon.  It was like a cinnamon cloud come flying out of his nose and his mouth at the same time.  That's got to be slow-moed, by the way. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  Was it like blowing an Iraqi?  Wait till you see this video on YouTube later today.  Oh, my God.  So, what was it feeling like, man?  Did it burn?  No.  You tried to swallow it, and it clogs up your throat, so your throat kind of, like, convulses  and pushes it up.  So, it shot out my mouth, went up the back through my nose and into, like, my sinus.  Oh, man.  And from the smoke, it went into my eyes, which was an added bonus, I guess. 
[02:55:00]  Cinnamon in the eye.  Freshest breath, though.  A little cinnamon-y.  It is very cinnamon-y.  It's still kind of stuck.  That was scary, man.  The nose and the mouth.  You, at one point, couldn't breathe.  Yeah, my throat closed.  That's fucking scary.  You turned red, and then what happened?  Like, you were able to really...  My, um...  Like, right in here, started...  Diaphragm.  Yeah, I started going nuts and started just, like, making me even. 
[02:55:30]  Can you look up how many people have died doing that?  What are you looking at?  It looks like blood vessels just all around his eyes just popped.  Yeah, man, it did.  Around his eyes, they're all red.  Look at yourself in the mirror.  Holy shit, are you kidding?  Yeah, look at me.  I should have seen the spoonful that Bob gave him.  Yeah, Bob.  Oh, no.  See, I wasn't even...  That's good, Trev.  I'm glad you're on the payroll, you company ass.  Way to go, Bob.  I gave...  You almost killed E-Roc. 
[02:56:00]  Come here, E-Roc.  Let me see your eyes.  Rewind and hear you go in heaping.  That's all I can see.  E-Roc, let me see your eyes.  Shh.  I don't see his eyes.  Turn your side, babe.  It's like the right side.  Turn this way.  Wow, yeah, right here.  On the corners?  You're going to have, like, black eyes.  Yeah, those are just...  He just popped blood vessels from pushing.  Yeah, no shit.  That'll, like, fucking...  Jesus, bro.  That'll make him have...  Those are going to have black eyes.  You all right, E-Roc?  He's got two shiners.  No, he's not going to have black eyes.  Poor sweetie. 
[02:56:30]  Are you coming back now?  The water going down easier?  No.  We got to have an EMS on if we do shit like that, man.  That almost year I could hurt.  If, when...  An EMT, you mean?  EMS.  EMS?  UPS guy.  Look, we did our research.  We saw a hot chick do it on YouTube.  We figured we were safe.  You're okay, man.  You'll be fine, but...  We are so never doing that again.  We should all get him cinnamon something for Christmas.  Why would you ever do that again?  We got the greatest reaction ever.  I know, but...  That's the best cinnamon challenge.  Never do it again. 
[02:57:00]  Video ever.  I want to know what it is, though, that makes your body not...  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  That's good.  He catches it in his hand.  He's a good boy.  But is it the salmon, or is there other stuff that works like that?  I don't know.  It's the cinnamon is, like he said, it's a dry thing.  Well, if you ask the question, I wanted to give you an answer.  I didn't know you were going to set me up.  Five minutes...  No, but I didn't realize you were going to try to answer, like, fucking Marcus Welby.  Well, three minutes ago, you're giving him a fucking...  Hey, excuse me.  We got a doctor.  Oh, cool. 
[02:57:30]  I hope it's Kevorkian.  Mike from...  Are you from Wisconsin?  Hello?  Are you from Wisconsin?  Hey, boys, I'm from Pennsylvania.  Oh.  So you're not a cheesehead?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Don't worry.  All right.  Marcus Welby.  I'm from the Tiki guys here, and what happens when you put that powder in your mouth, and  your first reaction is to breathe, that powder goes right down in your lungs, and it causes  your vocal cords to go on a spasm.  It's called a laryngospasm.  And then your lungs go on a bronchospasm, and it's just a nasty, nasty reaction. 
[02:58:00]  Can you die from that shit?  Absolutely.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  If you get enough of that shit down there on top of your vocal cords, your vocal cords  actually will close completely shut.  And it's called laryngospasm, and yeah, you can freaking die from that if you get too  much shit down there.  So then why is cinnamon legal?  Because you're not supposed to take a tablespoon of it.  I'm not even joking.  Like, I remember as a kid, like, I would like to eat cinnamon. 
[02:58:30]  No.  I swear to God.  I never ate cinnamon like that.  Maybe cinnamon sugar, I guess.  Cinnamon sugar you can eat.  What's going on, boys?  All right?  Wait, sir.  What other powders will do that?  Any kind of powders like that.  As soon as you put it in your mouth and you take a breath, it just goes right down in  your lungs.  And then it causes bronchospasm down in your lungs.  Now, E-Rock's going to feel like shit the rest of the day because that stuff is down still  in his lungs, and he thought I was going to be coughing that crap up the rest of the  day.  Is he going to be all right, though?  Yeah, he'll be fine.  What about sperm? 
[02:59:00]  Is that okay?  Sperm?  I don't know.  All right, boys.  Punching out.  Have a good day.  Oh, it'll be on the website.  Just shut up.  Well, Eric, it's miserable.  Frigging people are bitching at me for missing it on Pal Talk.  Sometimes I'm not...  When I think E-Rock is dying, I'm not focusing a fucking camera.  Yeah.  Rich in Ohio.  Rich.  I almost killed E-Rock.  I can't believe...  That's the funniest one ever.  I almost feel terrible that I called him. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, because he suggested to watch the video.  You all right there, E-Rock?  I'm sorry, E-Rock.  E-Rock, you all right?  E-Rock, you all right?  I don't know.  What does it feel like?  Do you want to go to the hospital?  What?  Do you want to go home?  No, I'm very lightheaded right now.  While you were breathing and stuff.  Why don't someone take him down somewhere?  Why don't you lay down?  E-Rock, why don't you go lie down?  Why don't E-Rock go somewhere? 
[03:00:00]  You want me to go to the store?  Get you something?  Do you want some cinnamon altoids or some cinnamon toast?  Big red.  Some big red.  Oh, God.  That is awful.  E-Rock, why don't you take the rest of the day off and then we'll, you know, we'll talk  about how you told me to shut up tomorrow.  Ah, there it is.  That's the biggest thing on your fucking mind is that he told you to shut the fuck up.  We'll deal with that little issue tomorrow.  Take the rest of the day off. 
[03:00:30]  Just relax and come back for your beheading.  You're feeling a little better.  You want to sit on the reclining chair there, E-Rock, and recline a little bit?  No, I'm all right.  That'll make you feel better.  You might as well get comfy.  Get comfortable, man.  Normally you're not permitted in those chairs.  What about our, how about our, how about our, talk about how you told me to shut up.  Can somebody get him a tissue so he can blow his nose?  Yeah, no.  That is horrible.  Our EMT friends, are they in the area? 
[03:01:00]  Maybe they can come by and just check out the E.  Let's go.  We do this on comedy fashion.  Eight hours after he's dead, they show up.  You're all right.  He's up.  He's up and around.  He could have really died, though.  I know that.  He could have really.  Well, that's part of the suspense.  What?  E-Rock, seriously, all right?  Sit down in that chair for a little while.  Yeah, you sit down in that chair.  You're king for a day.  You get to sit there.  Sit down with your cinnamon-y lungs.  Yeah.  He's going to shit now, too, he said, right?  Now he's drinking Diet Coke.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, ONA's 20th anniversary retrospective. 
[03:01:30]  Retrospective.  Hey, look who I know.  I'm looking here, who just walked into the studio.  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  We would have been here earlier.  Foundry Music Steve stopped us down the hall.  Pablo gets to walk right in.  We get stopped.  Oh, look at the callback.  I love it.  Well, he's had a security there, Fezzy.  Ron, what were you doing all day that no one could contact you?  We're taking care of stuff, buddy.  We're taking care of stuff.  Big news.  Big news is coming up.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[03:02:00]  Big news.  Yeah.  Are you going to become a sports guy?  Is that the news?  That's like hearing you just got cancer.  That's going to be their new promo, I hear.  That's like saying, is it malignant?  That's what they say.  Malignant.  Well, it is the same as saying you've got three months.  Right.  The same thing.  Put your affairs in order.  Morning.  You're a sports guy.  Sports guy.  Although, Fez is now Pharrell Fez, whatever the hell that means. 
[03:02:30]  Is that it?  I don't know why.  We like Scott Pharrell.  We love it.  It works for you.  I haven't met him yet.  We like this sports guy combo.  There's a combo now?  Yeah.  There's always a combo.  There's always a combo.  You're always just changing the numbers a little bit.  I like the Scotty Pharrell in the same way I like to watch a small child play with a loaded gun.  Because, you know, someday he's just going to kill himself with it.  The best advice.  Yeah, right.  And you enjoy that.  It's fun to watch.  If you like him, the best advice is never take a vacation, Scott. 
[03:03:00]  You know, Blaine's going, you know,  I don't really need any time off.  I'm fine.  How surprised was Blaine?  He took two weeks off for Christmas and had a job when he came back.  Right.  Blaine was in here Christmas morning looking around.  Everything okay?  Is it cool?  So, Ron?  All right.  Let me get this straight.  You get a beautiful collector's item from Al Dukes.  He collects stuff like this.  Oh, yeah.  I got a Robotron.  That thing is...  My Robotron's worth $2,000.  I love Robotron.  Best thing.  Now, this. 
[03:03:30]  When I walked in there, it's like...  That's like Captain Fantastic at Elton John.  Right.  Only $1,000 made.  Well, we're here in $5,700.  Oh, is that right?  But who's counting?  And I just saw on eBay there's one of those available in better condition for that $570.  Oh, I heard $3,000.  What happened to the $3,000?  Hey, it's talking it up.  It's like the engagement ring all of a sudden turns out to be a cubic zirconium.  And a certificate proving that it's fake.  Well, no matter what we do, I say we sell it if you don't like it.  We're all for $1,200.  $1,200.  Ain't about it.  $1,200?  It's not about the money with us. 
[03:04:00]  Why don't we do this?  Then all the proceeds go to a half ounce of Coke that we can relax with.  You're going to be a Coke or it's going to be okay, okay?  Let me tell you something.  It's going to be great, okay?  That's Pablo Escobar.  Fantastic.  Pablo Escobar.  That's when radio was great, when you could just sell one of those guitars off the...  Grab some Coke.  Listen, I'm serious.  Just take it, and then I'll get back to you with the rest of the money.  That's Clapton's guitar!  That's Clapton's!  You're going to write a book, too.  Yeah, right. 
[03:04:30]  Well, no, it's not about the money.  It's about breaking his heart.  See, this is the thing.  This is what it's all about.  Al Dukes is, I've said this, in love with Opie.  Let's not candy coat this.  He's in love with the man.  Right.  And it's a little disturbing.  No, it's true, though.  It is!  He pictures Opie up on top of that pinball machine like it was Jodie Foster.  Jodie Foster.  Oh, God.  And the accused.  Oh, awful.  What? 
[03:05:00]  There we are.  Now we sit and...  Well, it's yours to do whatever you want with.  That's the way I see it.  Well, I'm sure he'll replace it with something much more lavish if you destroy this one.  Ron Corleone, I'm asking you, if you're going to do this, please.  No, it came to me.  There was a kid who brought in a pinball machine.  When it was smashed, I didn't go looking.  I didn't ask any questions.  Because this is the business we've chose.  No, you've got to do what you've got to do, Ope. 
[03:05:30]  I'm just showing respect to your family.  That is respect.  That's total respect.  I don't want to smash the machine.  You're going to keep bringing me back in.  Ron Corleone.  It's up to you.  I mean, do you think you'll feel better smashing a collectible pinball machine?  He always feels better when he smashes people's gifts.  I'm just afraid we're not going to get anything ever again.  Because every time...  All right, hold on.  Remember Anthony Limo guy brought in the Jets gumball machine?  Right.  Nice.  It was a bobbly.  It was a stupid bobbly head.  Stalker Patty, everything she brings in. 
[03:06:00]  Smash.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Remember when Rascals gave us the Louis XIII scotch?  The cognac.  Cognac or whatever?  Yeah.  Nice.  Didn't smash that.  No.  I love when Caroline's and people bring the really expensive champagne by.  Nice.  It's got to be expensive.  Yeah, right.  Well, the cheap stuff.  Come on.  We all know.  And then we get some bottles of wine from time to time.  Know what I got today that I'm fully enjoying and will not smash?  A Kurt Cobain poster from the fine folks down there in Philly at WYSP. 
[03:06:30]  The Kurt and Corby movie poster.  It's on our wall.  Nice.  So I don't break everything.  Is it an after poster?  Was he laying there on the ground?  Is it just the feet?  Just the feet showing?  You know you're going to get the calls now.  Dude, shut up.  You know, he was a genius, man.  Dick.  I just don't like.  I wish you had the talent he had in his feet.  I just don't like kiss asses.  He's kissing ass.  He's just ridiculous.  I know in his heart he thought that you were just going to say, okay, Al. 
[03:07:00]  Right.  This was unbelievable.  This is what I said.  Man, you should hang.  Right.  He thought this was going to turn into, Al, man, you know, we had our thing.  Or maybe even that opiate would go, ah, it's been a bit, you know.  I just wanted to go.  But I really want you to know I appreciate the pinball machine.  Everything's great.  Now open mouth kiss me.  You know?  That's how he feels.  I can tell.  The guy is attracted to you.  Right.  The guy talks in terms of relationships. 
[03:07:30]  You used that word?  The relationship with Opie.  He wants to hang out.  They'll laugh about this over beers when they're hanging.  I mean, what?  He asked your girlfriend about you, like what kind of things you like to do.  What he's like off the air.  That really put it over the top when he's asking my girlfriend.  Well, how is he like off the air?  Yeah.  See, I think the strategy is.  About your effing business.  He buys you a big enough gift that he has to help you move it to home.  Oh, is that it?  That he gets to see your house.  I think late at night he's looking out his window like Fievel, just wondering what the 
[03:08:00]  hell you're up to.  Ah.  He's glamping.  Somewhere out there.  He's just gazing towards Long Island.  What's your high score?  No, he's doing something.  That's how he feels about you, though.  Is he all uncomfortable in the back office?  Yeah.  Oh, we're reenacting the mailroom thing.  Have to.  Yeah.  The carameler mailroom.  Keep him in the mailroom situation.  Keep him in the mailroom until Opie passes by him.  All right.  That really happened for about six months around here.  I got no problem with that.  It was the only way to separate certain radio hosts from each other. 
[03:08:30]  Well, what are we doing?  Make him say goodbye to his machine.  Oh, God.  Make him say goodbye to his machine.  Make him kiss Mick Jagger goodbye.  Make him say goodbye, dude.  On the unit.  Make him say I'm going to miss you to Mick Jagger.  You got a mic?  Go outside the studio.  He's not coming in the studio.  Grab him and make him come down.  Go get Al.  No, don't bring him in here.  Not in here.  Let him stand outside.  It's really uncomfortable.  It's embarrassing.  Just make him stand in the corner over there like in the Blair Witch Project. 
[03:09:00]  He has to stand in the corner as Opie kills the machine.  With his back to the pinball machine.  He just hears the horrible sounds of it.  All right.  Have him lay down, and he doesn't know whether the pinball machine is going to get hit or him.  Don't give up to that choice.  We'll be playing pinball after it's all done.  And you'll finally get your new producer.  If you can kneecap him, then don't break the machine.  A little hobbling.  So what are we doing?  Oh, is this Al Dukes? 
[03:09:30]  Yes, it is.  Where are you?  I'm in one of the production rooms.  Oh.  Are you staring at us right now?  Are you watching Opie?  No, I'm in a closed office.  I'm watching you through the glass, Opie.  I'm in a closed office.  You know where you are.  A game.  Yeah.  You're holding the phone with one hand, and what are you doing with the other as you gaze  at the man you love?  No, I'm not attracted to Opie.  Oh, really?  No.  You sure know how to show it.  It was just, I brought a nice gesture.  Do you understand that's a nice gesture reserved for couples, maybe, that have been in love? 
[03:10:00]  Maybe a guy is a collector of these things, and his wife scrapes up money for years to  afford something like this, and you just get it for Opie for what?  For what?  For as a gesture to say, hey.  A gesture gift is a bottle.  A bottle of maybe Captain Morgan rum.  Here's a good gesture.  It's like, here, it mixes well with Coke.  Here you go.  Both kinds.  Guys don't buy other guys' stuff. 
[03:10:30]  Especially stuff like that.  Did this fantasy of yours end with Opie taking a baseball bat to the present?  Did this come into your equation anywhere?  No, I don't have any fantasies about Opie.  I was just making a nice gesture, just, hey, whatever I did in the past upset him.  To make your relationship better?  To make your relationship with him better?  A work relationship.  I'll say this, but first he asked me if Opie skied.  He wanted to get him skis.  Now, that's strange.  Were you talking about skis?  No.  He goes, does he Opie ski? 
[03:11:00]  I go, I don't know.  You know how personal?  Because I like to get him skis.  He wanted to get you any sort of athletic wear.  Yeah, some kind of vest he wanted to get you.  Skis are such a personal item.  Really is.  Go to Aspen and have a little romantic ski party.  Yeah, you want to go to Aspen with him?  Little ski party.  Aspen.  Aspen.  Aspen, yeah.  Kevin.  Yeah, I'm here.  Hi, Kevin.  Hi.  Hey, Al.  Look who's on the phone.  Hey, Kev.  Hey, Al.  It's your dealer.  What are they going to do?  Well, it's looking grim. 
[03:11:30]  Looking grim, huh?  Do you have repairs over there?  Want to make out?  We do extensive repairs.  Yeah, you might have to.  Extensive.  I think we should just save the pieces, maybe, and sell them off, you know, one piece of  glass at a time.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He's getting up.  Oh, no.  Oh, jeez.  No.  He's getting up.  He's getting up.  He's slow.  Oh, no.  He's getting up.  He's getting up.  Now, that thing's worth a lot of money, right?  It is.  Okay.  Hold on. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, no.  Tell the answer to run.  Everyone's kind of running away from the area.  What a difference a day makes.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Everybody was happy yesterday.  Now.  Oh, God.  All right.  Hold on here.  Did you guys restore that pinball machine?  Was it wrecked when you?  It was pretty trash.  Nothing worked.  He used to do rails off the top of it.  Are the decals the same as the originals?  Yeah. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, no.  All right.  He's got the sledgehammer.  Oh, my God.  Hey, all I got to tell you is maybe someone should shield their frigging eyes.  I predict Opie cutting his wrist off.  I don't think he's going to do it.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Look, look, man.  It is.  Dude, it's a classic.  Don't.  Oh, it almost fell off the chair.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's like a movie from Chris E.  No, no, no. 
[03:13:00]  He's got it.  No.  He's got the big Gallagher mallet.  It took like a year to find that thing.  Watch this.  Where's Al?  Make Al watch.  Wait a minute.  They're pulling him out.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  They're pulling him out, Opie.  Yeah, give us the Rambo First Blood 2.  He got you this thing out of the goodness of his heart.  This is just going to be like that scene in Rocky 3 where Pauly throws the bottle right  through the pinball machine.  Oh, look at his face.  Oh, no.  I mean, this is what you want to do.  There's a Al.  Hey, Al.  Hey, Opie.  It's so sad. 
[03:13:30]  There's your boyfriend.  It's so sad.  With the mallet.  I dare you.  This is so cool.  I mean, I just got it as a gesture.  Yeah, we accept Visa, MasterCard.  Business relationship thing.  Oh, boy.  There's a government.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  It's gone.  Oh, no, no.  They're killing me, man.  Look out.  See, did you hear that?  There's pinball collectors throwing themselves out windows. 
[03:14:00]  Keith Moon lives.  Keith Moon lives.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  You know, that's copyrighted material.  There is one heartbroken little Nancy boy out there.  Dude, he completely didn't think you were going to do that.  He totally did not believe you were really going to do that.  That's what I think of your gift, and that's what I think of you. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, God.  There is a mess out there.  Make him clean it up.  It looked like a car wreck.  Make him clean it up.  You can't even tell what it was.  No.  No.  It looks like James Dean's car.  Save the pieces.  He said save the pieces.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  There are no pieces left to hit the flipper, then hit Mick Jagger right in the groin, and  he disappears.  Now, do you have a kiss machine?  Maybe you'd like kiss.  Oh, God. 
[03:15:00]  No kiss.  No kiss.  You want a kiss machine?  No.  No.  Don't send anything.  Why don't you just hit it with a hammer over there?  Probably a better idea.  Yeah.  Just break it there.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe the sound.  I'm going to look at it.  That's what I think.  All right.  Well, um.  The warranty just expired.  I can't believe you guys did that.  I might be right.  It was fun.  I want to get a girl and flashback.  Uh-oh.  What's happening now?  Thank you, Kevin.  All right.  We'll be back in just a bit.  It's ONA's 20th anniversary retrospective. 
[03:15:30]  Jimmy, I got to ask Mr. Chuck, uh, Chuck or something.  Uh, Hurricane Katrina, you lost a lot.  Now, see, you think I'm Fats Domino.  Everybody think all the...  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Think all the black guys look the same?  That's right.  Unbelievable.  Chubby's got my arm.  Hey, hey, there you go.  Hey, that's Fats Domino.  That's not Chubby, Checker.  Of course it is.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And his lady says, oh, he says, I know you had trouble with this, Katrina.  I says, that's Fats Domino. 
[03:16:00]  I go in the airport.  Guess what they say?  What do they say?  Hey, Mr. Barry.  I says, I'm Chuck Barry.  Mr. Barry.  Lady says, lady says to me, she says, she says, oh, there's Charlie Pryor.  I says, thank you, ma'am.  You know his cousin Marvin Barry?  I get all that.  I'm on Frankenstein.  It's so annoying.

Of course not.  Did you get him in the CD?  Lord, I think we saw some of that rage.  That was that rage.  Yeah.  Wow, that was it.  That was like one of those bad court dramas on TV where the guy finally snaps on the stand. 
[03:26:30]  Finally cracks him.  The lawyer cracks him.  All right, I did it, see?  All right, hold on.  And I'm not sorry.  I'd do it again.  All right, let's go to the phones here.  Jesus.  Bernie, there's your CD right there.  Okay, thank you.  That's not the one he...  Relax, that's not the one.  That's yours.  Tell him.  That's the one he used in the studio.  Eric, explain.  Explain what we do.  Bernie, the joke, he had another CD.  Oh, whatever.  It was a separate CD.  Sure?  It was totally...  Take a look at it.  It's not even broken or damaged.  Anyway, it's okay. 
[03:27:00]  Watch your life.  Watch your life.  No, no, no.  I want to go...  It's 9 o'clock.  They want to go home.  They still want to talk to you.  Go back inside and at least...  Let's not burn bridges.  Let's go back in.  Come back in and talk.  He's coming in.  Nice to meet you.  Wait, that sounds scary.  Hold on.  He's coming in.  They just want to talk to you.  I hope he's building a barrier.  All right, Bernie.  Bernie.  Wait, sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  No, it's 9 o'clock.  Bernie.  Let me explain what happened, though, Bernie.  I'm going to explain what happened.  Wait, put on your headphones.  Let me explain.  Yeah.  Let me explain. 
[03:27:30]  Because we really like you.  We want you to be a friend of the show.  I love Bernie Getz, and I don't want to get off on the wrong foot here.  We felt like...  Here.  I'm listening.  I'm listening.  We felt like you were a friend of the show, that we could pull one of our gags on you.  That's all that was.  It was a joke.  It was a joke.  Here's the...  Okay.  Right here.  I'm going to show you.  Calm down.  Here's the CD I was smashing.  Okay.  I didn't know that.  Okay.  Here's...  The CD I was smashing was called Haunted Pussy.  Oh, okay.  That's okay.  It had nothing to do with the one that...  You were smashing Haunted Pussy.  You said it.  That's fine.  Bernie, I never touched your CD. 
[03:28:00]  I took this one, and Eric snuck it in, and, you know, made the old switcheroo.  Bernie, we're still pals?  Things are okay.  All right.  Things are okay.  But I'm glad we had this story.  I'm glad we had this story.  I'm glad we had this story.  A friend of mine.  I consider you...  Bernie, okay, or just, or whatever.  Bernie, look at your CD.  You think it's okay.  Bernie does not like...  It's okay.  Look at your CD.  There's not a scratch on it.  I didn't smash you.  I trust you.  All right?  Sure enough to look at it.  I thought we were at that stage in our friendship that we could pull one of our gags on you.  That's all.  Well, I smashed your CD, though.  It's like... 
[03:28:30]  It's like...  I mean, it wasn't as bad as...  What if someone took your kid and said, I'm hanging your kid out the window like Michael  Jackson?  Well, there you go.  That man.  I know.  That man.  It's not that man.  It's only a CD.  There you go.  All right, Bernie.  So we're cool.  We're cool.  And anyway, that's the news for the week.  Thank you, Bernie.  Okay?  Very good.  Bernie gets everybody.  Now that everybody knows what's happening in the world, you know?  I hear you.  And his...  Yeah, that was cool in the gang.  That was intense.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You guys are...  Now I know what those guys felt on that subway.  I'll tell you that much.  All night and day, the way he can turn it on. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  He really turned it on.  Oh, what a quick fuse.  That's not a slow burn.  You taking the subway home?  Everything's cool, Bernie.  Everything's open.  Shut the fuck up.  We're going to be like little Fonzies.  What's Fonzie, Bernie?  I don't know.  Cool.  Cool.  Oh, yeah.  That's okay.  Yeah, Bernie, we didn't watch you.  We didn't watch you.  It's going to be a mild winter.  Mild winter.  We didn't watch you going away mad.  Mild winter.  All right.  Is that yours?  Oh, you dropped something, Bernie?  All right.  There you go.  Okay. 
[03:29:30]  Now let's take the same ski jacket he was probably wearing back in the middle.  Okay, guys.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you, Bernie.  Bernie, thank you.  Bernie, guys.  I'm going to talk to you again soon.  Is this Bernie?  Is this yours?  Say again.  Yes, you did.  He was coming back in.  All right.  He's walking out.  Wow, man.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That was legendary.  Dude, that was the rage.  That was what happened on that train.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train.  We saw it.  We saw it.  Yeah.  Eric was in between me and Bernie, and I got to give Eric a lot of credit, man. 
[03:30:00]  He was holding him back.  He was out of his mind.  You know what's odd?  We were talking about Rain Man, and when you were watching Rain Man, remember, it was  kind of like you look at Dustin Hoffman and go, it's not too bad.  He's a little kooky and stuff, but he seems nice and sweet.  And then that time he lost it at the airport.  Oh, yeah.  He just lost his mind.  That's what we saw.  That snap.  That was right now.  You just threw his CD.  It was like a Pop-Tart in the toaster, and a little smoke billowed up, and he couldn't  handle it.  Right.  Imagine that, though.  No, but you didn't see it coming. 
[03:30:30]  No.  It came out of nowhere.  He just lost.  Fuck you.  Keep your CD.  Keep your CD.  Fuck you.  And take this with you.  You have another.  Keep your CD.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  I have...  Look at me.  I'm still...  Ovi's shaking.  I am shaking.  Dude, you had a pissed Bernie Gats right here in your face.  When you started smashing it, the look on his face, that's when he snapped. 
[03:31:00]  Keep your fucking CD.  Rawr.  Wow.  Eric, is he all right?  He's gone.  Eric, you...  I have to tell you, you rock.  No problem.  Eric got in between me and Bernie.  Bernie was literally like, what?  He kept kneeing me in the leg.  I'm like, stop.  He's like, give me my CD, my CD.  And I'm sitting here with this hand, trying to cover his real CD so he doesn't see it.  Nope, he's just sitting there going, oh my God.  Could you imagine if he's got to go on the subway right now?  Oh.  Some black guy is in his seat or something? 
[03:31:30]  Oh, forget it.  With an iPod?  Disrespecting CDs?  All right.  Bernie, what's the matter?  Hot water burn baby.  Hot water burn baby.  Fucking psychopath.  Why don't we take a break?  We have Billy Burr in studio.  And that's the news for today.  Keep your fucking CDs.  It's ONA's 20th anniversary.  The Opie and Anthony channel.  All Opie, all Anthony, all the time.  24-7.

Jimmy, you want to set the scene for the people that are just tuning in? 
[03:40:30]  Well, apparently, there was many years ago, 1996, when O.P. and Anthony were at WAAF.  There was some serious stuff going on.  They had a TV show, which was apparently a hit, which was canceled by a censoring network.  By the way, I found all the Real Rock TV shows.  That's something no one really has, and they will start appearing up on the website.  We're not allowed to mention.  Right.  That pretty much is the name of our radio show.  Yeah, figure it out.  So this is some audio from the show. 
[03:41:00]  When they got back at the TV station, I mean, this was Craig dressed up like military guys.  They were dropping balloons with bras on them and crazy stuff out of a hot air.  It was madness.  Oh, this is so bad.  And they had been built up to it for a few days, and this was day three of the war.  This was the big assault.  This was what we were gearing up for.  We were gearing up for. 
[03:41:30]  We were going to go and take a hot air dirigible type balloon, two-person balloon,  and fly it over the TV station and then drop paint that is in brassieres on the television station.  All over those mother huckers.  Go get them, boys.  All those mother huckers.  So, yeah, we go back to the tape that's well over 12 years old at this point. 
[03:42:00]  And here's the attack from the sky, brother man.  I guess we're setting up what we're going to do here.  Yeah, lots of man dudes.  D-Rocky is having so much fun with this the last couple days.  Big smile on his face for the first time in well over a year.  Yeah.  In this bit, Ope is really trying to stress his catchphrase, brother man.  Why not?  You have a huge audience for the war.  You might as well sell some shirts.  Get some T-shirts going.  Puffy mugs.  I can't.  Maybe an ice scraper or two with brother man on it. 
[03:42:30]  Whoa, hey.  Ice scraper.  Hold back on.  Scrape your windshield with a brother man ice scraper.  Whoa, hey.  Whoa.  Outrageous.  Plastic beer mugs.  Got this from a shark, Chuck.  Whoa, watch out.  Oh, God.  D-Rocky's pushing the catchphrase hard?  He just keeps working it in when he can.  I couldn't.  Shut up.  I'm sure I'm standing in the morning.  Jimmy, your condescending crap is killing me.  And I just realized that I continue to try the catchphrase thing because I'm trying to get 
[03:43:00]  lingy-longy going.  So, bleep, bleep.  Some things don't end.  Didn't Hitler have a cat phrase?  A cat phrase.  Meow.  Cat phrase.  Cat phrase.  All right.  Back to this 12-year-old show.  I'm getting a little nervous.  Why?  I don't know.  You can't back out now, brother man.  I'm not backing out because I'm a little.  It's.  Ah.  You really wanted to let it go.  That was a good, like, a little incentive for me. 
[03:43:30]  So, I was getting a little nervous.  And, hey, you can't back out now, brother man.  Sure.  Oh, I'm surprised you guys didn't cut your fingers and become blood brothers first.  Brother man.  Unfortunately, Ponyboy.  They already taken Stegold.  That was a perfect opportunity.  I'm trying to pump him up.  I'm Newt Rockne, man.  I'm just getting Anthony ready.  Oh, yeah.  I'm patting.  You're Matt Dillon.  Pat.  Come on.  Let's do it for Johnny, brother man. 
[03:44:00]  Do it for Johnny.  Right, brother.  Do it for Johnny.  Oof.  I got to hold on again.  Okay.  Okay.  Go ahead.  It's not bad.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Hold on.  It's horrid.  And don't even say it's not.  It's weird, the difference between it and I.  It's really uncomfortable.  But for some reason, I really enjoy the uncomfortable.  I don't know.  I can't.  And Anthony can't even look at anyone in the room.  No, I got to just stare.  Come on, brother man.  Look over here.  Shut up.  Come on.  You can do it, brother man.  There you go.  Shut up.  Come on. 
[03:44:30]  Don't be a mother hucker.  Look how Bob Kelly's sitting up nice and tight.  Oh, he is happy today.  He's got confidence, man.  He's not slouching.  He's never had anybody with so many cat phrases.  He didn't realize you almost ruined us, you dope.  Thank God Voss is here.  I'm sure he'll say something else stupid.  It'll be about him eventually.  I'll be out, Wolf.  Ready?  Ready?  All right.  All right.  I'm holding on.  Why? 
[03:45:00]  I don't know.  You can't back out now, brother man.  I'm not backing out, but I'm a little, it's scary.  The whole thought of this is a little scary.  If you're just tuning in, it is day three of the war against ABU.  And we're stepping it up a notch, let's say.  I don't think ABU can stop us at this point.  No.  No, no.  It would take a lot to stop us at this point.  Actually, Anthony and I got to leave the studio.  Yeah.  An off switch.  Jimmy.  I hate that Jimmy is here for this. 
[03:45:30]  We told everyone yesterday, yeah, we're not going to get to this thing until Thursday  when Jimmy gets back.  He comes back a day early.  We got the rest of the guys in here, so.  Look at Anthony's white knuckles.  I'm grabbing this console so tight.  Oh, yeah.  That's what happened to me.  Take it up a notch, man.  This is crazy.  This is my worst.  You know, brother man, from back then.  Wasn't bad from back then, right?  Oh, I'm saying.  White.  Actually, Anthony and I got to leave the studio in about half hour or so. 
[03:46:00]  And never come back, hopefully.  We got a rendezvous at a secret location.  Right.  We got our fatigues on.  We're dressed in full military regalia.  Again.  It's too much, man.  And we will be retaliating from the sky this afternoon.  We learned a lesson from Desert Storm a few years back that you got to pound him from  the air first.  That's right.  All right.  What are you going to do?  Okay.  Shut up.  What do you know, Anthony?  I'm not repeating anything.  I'm not saying anything.  Why?  Lessons were in front. 
[03:46:30]  I just want to go away.  I want to go away.  We have a war going on now.  Maybe we can help them out.  How do you do it?  You what?  You pounded him from the air?  Bobby.  Yes, sir.  Shut up.  I'm just...  Just shut up.  Why?  You're asking legit questions.  You've got to get out of the studio in a half hour.  You should have said that at 5.30 this morning.  Yeah.  We decided to play that.  Why don't you act like a general stuffer? 
[03:47:00]  Brother man.  I can't listen to this.  General Hacking.  It's killing me.  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, Chris.  This is day three of the war, huh?  Yeah.  So would this be your double D day?  It's a bra joke, because we're going to drop bra bombs.  Are we?  Oh, my God.  Man's dressed in a full regalia.  Again.  Regalia.  Regalia. 
[03:47:30]  Regalia.  Shut up.  If they didn't tune in at three to hear regalia, they heard it at four.  That's important.  Yeah, brother man.  You're right.  You got to pound him from the air first.  That's right.  Before you could launch the ground assault.  So we're going for an air assault.  That's right.  They are going to be surprised, aren't they, brother man?  Oh, bro.  Oh, no.  How did we get a job?  How did we get a job in New York? 
[03:48:00]  You know how I said, like, I enjoy this?  A couple shots to the head.  Come on, brother man.  I'm going to see how much of this I can take.  Wow.  A couple shots to the noggin.  Oh, boy.  Every time I hear brother man, it's something inside me, like I'm getting shocked.  Oh, wow.  That's rough.  I think you guys are good together.  I think you're really working off each other well.  I agree.  No, seriously. 
[03:48:30]  You get all the terminology and you do the pep talks.  Come on, brother man.  Man, this is going to be war.  This is the whole buildup.  See, we're trying to paint the picture so that once we take to the air, everyone will  believe it, man.  Dude, who's getting out of that car with this on?  I wish I was at 60.  Let's go to Nathan in Virginia.  Nathan.  Hey, what's up, boy?  Hey.  Hey, why the hell were you guys in fatigue if you was in a hot air balloon in the sky? 
[03:49:00]  Well, maybe they were dressed in the face of the voice of reason.  He had cloud shirts on, those cloud hats.  Yeah, Anthony had like a little bird painted on his shirt.  Hope he had the airplane on his back.  We couldn't even do hack radio, right?  Right now, this guy's like, brings up a valid point.  Let's go to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Hey, guys.  Was this before or after Rocco stole the van and decided to camp out on a billboard? 
[03:49:30]  Let's go to Peter in Maine, I think.  Peter.  Yes.  Opie, are you ready to hate my guts?  Yeah, go ahead.  I was listening to, you know, I was doing some stuff and kind of half listening to, you know,  some of the old bits.  And I swear to God, old Opie sounds like E-Rock.  I think E-Rock kind of modeled himself after the original Opie tapes.  Yeah, E-Rock ripped me off.  Yeah. 
[03:50:00]  I was doing garlic buttersaw way before E-Rock was.  I know, his hot air balloon's parked outside.  It's regalia.  Pat from Wiennake wants to know after the war, did me and Opie have a big kiss in Times Square?  Fruits.  Are going to be surprised, aren't they, brother man?  Oh, brother, if we die doing this, I'm going to be pissed.  You are.  Yeah, it's too big, dude.  Yeah, that's right, though. 
[03:50:30]  Oh, wow.  And I am.  Wow.  What was that at the end there?  I don't know.  That's right.  They are going to be surprised, aren't they, brother man?  Oh, brother.  If we die doing this, I'm going to be pissed.  We'd go down in history, though, dude.  Yeah, it's too big idiots.  Yeah, that's all right, though.  Yep.  All right, Keanu.  Certainly did.  That was pretty harsh to you to jump in there.  Two big idiots. 
[03:51:00]  Wow.  Oh, mighty.  Guns blazing.  Give me.  And you're always going to surprise them.  Two fatheads.  Feel like a lunkhead.  How is this going to surprise you?  Are they going to be in the building going, are those bras landing on the roof?  Wait a second.  Those sound like bras.  Oh, just wait.  New message board name.  It's already taken.  Brother Man.  Brother Man.  And E-Rock has looked up Brother Man.  What do you got on that E-Rock?  From Urban Dictionary.  A word used to describe an extremely down-to-earth individual. 
[03:51:30]  Brother Man, are you and Big...  Oh, sorry.  Are you and Brother Dabin going over to PQ's house to hang with the brothers from KBC?  PQ's house to hang with the brothers from KBC.  A lot of KBC.  Let's go to Ritchie in Connecticut.  Ritchie.  F-U, A-B-U.  We hate you.  Ritchie.  Linger.  Yuck.  We play this...  This was rough yesterday when we played this. 
[03:52:00]  This was one of the clips we did play yesterday.  Oh, no.  It's me coming out of a record.  The future's been painted.  Red, white, and blue.  The only station that really rocks.  Beth Hart Band, Immortal.  We love you, Beth Hart.  She's the troublemaker.  She's the troublemaker.  She wouldn't wear a bra.  She is one of the reasons why the TV show was banned by W.A.B.U. in Boston, because Beth 
[03:52:30]  Hart, in the footage of her playing that song for our TV show, she was not wearing a bra.  Right.  You two should be attacking each other.  That's what you should be doing.  Sitting on each end of the studio, throwing funny lines at each other.  And maybe one will catch one.  Wow.  Just...  Do you really think it was...  You're the reason.  Do you think it was her not wearing a bra that got you kicked off the air?  You guys are the reason that there's crap radio.  Someone's home going, if they can do this, so can I. 
[03:53:00]  Okay?  1996.  Never realized how...  How just hacky, zooey we sounded.  Why?  With that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everything had to have a laugh behind it and just...  We found our voices up there because we started getting very angry.  Had it.  And we changed our whole delivery, thank God.  Who heard this and thought, like, these guys have to get it to New York? 
[03:53:30]  The question is, who didn't?  Ah.  Well, here's the last minute before we have to...  Let's just play it.  Oh, no.  Sophie and Anthony, we are in an unmarked van.  Oh, no.  Here it is.  The phone call.  Well, I guess we have officially left the broadcast center.  Where were we?  We were just in a production. 
[03:54:00]  Well, we were in the production studio.  We never left the radio station.  Oh, no, we did.  I think we...  Calling.  Wow, I don't remember.  I remember for some...  Yeah, no, we were...  We ended up in a...  I think this is us in a van going to the IHOP, which was close to the TV station, just to  check out, to see if they were going to believe what we were doing.  Oh, is that it?  I believe.  What's your servicemen?  Do they feed you free at the IHOP?  I mean, you come in, you're just...  On your way to battle, do you think a couple pancakes for the boys? 
[03:54:30]  I mean, some good old guys like you without a catchphrase?  In a full uniform, which in their case was with a nozzle hanging off their heads.  All right, you ready?  It's time to get the...  Oh, this is not good.  When do you drop the bras from Bobby?  See, it doesn't even work goofing on anybody else now.  You guys are free...  You have a pass.  Yes, we do, brother man.  You all have a pass, so this is...  This is the official deployment of Operation Bra Bomb. 
[03:55:00]  I like you're in an unmarked van, too.  We said that?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Unmarked.  Unmarked.  Like, there's no marking...  Like, what other marks would there be?  Guys on way to Bra Bomb?  I remember when the recruiters came to my school to get me to enlist into this war.  Yeah, it was for the Civil War.  Okay, that's funny.  Ready?  And then they'll be free and running through the streets.  You enjoyed that, didn't you?  Sophie and Anthony, we are in an unmarked van right now, bro. 
[03:55:30]  This is too much.  I'm getting nervous, man.  Don't get nervous.  We've got to do the retaliation against WABU for screwing us over with our TV show, man.  Tell everyone where we're off to, bro.  All right, we're going to a secret location, which is a parking lot, and we're actually  going to get into an air blimp.  Pause this.  I see a little flaw here.  You sure you're not going to a tie-dye festival?  A little question here.  The van's unmarked, undisclosed location, so you can get into a blimp. 
[03:56:00]  You know, I'm not even thinking about the logistics of this whole thing, that you're pointing  out.  I'm just thinking of the awfulness of it, but you're pointing out some very valid things  here.  You know how hard it is to hide a blimp in Worcester?  And did you hear Opie stutter through it, but just end with bro, to save it? 
[03:56:30]  There's one thing Opie did there, too, which I love.  It was to explain why they were doing it.  Like, it was kind of like coming back, like, you know, to avenge our TV.  Yes, yeah, he had to spoon-feed the audience.  It's called spoon-feeding, Jimmy.  Let's say hi to Karen, a jersey.  Karen.  Let's go to John in Staten Island.  John.  Instead of an unmarked van, you should have had a van with a giant douche on the side. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, my God.  You know what it is?  You've got to go unmarked.  This way the competition doesn't know you're coming.  You've got an undisclosed location, so the cops won't be waiting for it.  Of course.  That's right.  Just back that blimp into the Walmart with all the other blimps.  It's a dirigible.  You act like it's a VW van.  Oh, God, though.  Hot air blimp.  And we're going to fly over ABU and bomb them with bras and water balloons. 
[03:57:30]  Well, we're calling them the bra bomb.  Basically, they're water balloons with bras attached to them.  Now that they're on to this, we're probably going to have to get through their air defenses.  We'll be checking in in a few minutes here.  In the meantime, we might as well play the latest from Van Halen.  What?  We weren't even good enough yet to just do our talk show.  We weren't allowed to just talk.  See, when you have to pepper in music, you're not good enough to do a talk show yet. 
[03:58:00]  This is really early on.  You're going to bomb a TV studio, which is probably illegal on a lot of them.  But first, let's get to OU812.  And don't forget the Gallagher concert.  Twelve years ago.  Just want to say that.  Twelve years ago.  Yes.  Latest from Van Halen off the greatest hit CD that's coming out.  This song features David Lee Roth.  Anthony's getting excited. 
[03:58:30]  Give me your beer, man.  We're cranking up Van Halen in the car here.  Why couldn't the blimp have the same fate as the Hindenburg?  A lot of comments coming in.  Air defenses against the blimp.  A bunch of interns on the roof with fans.  Let's go to Nigel in Kentucky.  Nigel.  This is terrible. 
[03:59:00]  Yes.  Yes.  About the aircraft you were using to bomb their TV station, it wasn't the Enola Gay.  It was just the Enola Gay.  Let's say hi to Brandon.  Brandon, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I think this needs to be the next Coke Logic animation.  Oh, my God, yeah.  It would make a good one.  Yeah, it sure would.  I know what part he could use, too.  We got audio from us in the sky, which is... 
[03:59:30]  Oh, once we hit the sky in the blimp, you won't believe the action.  How did you make the wind effect?  Oh, you...  Wait till you hear the sound effects.  Well, it's...  We had a lot to work with in the production room.  Well, it's just...  All right.  We're getting there.  I think we could squeeze one more minute in, and then when we get back from break,  it's us actually in the air bombing the...  You don't have to use the stop right there.  ...TV station.  Bombing. 
[04:00:00]  Let's go to Caesar in Staten Island.  Caesar.  Yeah, I'm just wondering if the title of this little war episode was called We Were Morons.  Oh, no.  There goes another bit that's starting.  Band of Brother Mans.  Well, here we go.  Sophie and Anthony, we are at our destination.  Oh, man.  This thing is unreal. 
[04:00:30]  Look at this thing.  It's a blimp, but it's tiny.  I feel like I'm there.  Don't you?  I'm painting a picture.  This thing's unreal.  Look at this thing.  It's a blimp.  But it's tiny.  Tiny.  Blimp, but tiny.  Oh.  Black Hawk Down Syndrome.  People are coming in with movies.  Oh, boy.  A crock of shit now.  Saving private douche. 
[04:01:00]  Full metal.  We're going to need some lope wisers during the break.  The only thing that's going to save us.  Well, uh...  I can't.  Well, you see in the blimp now,  I've got to hear more of this.  It's like I'm in the car with you.  It sounds amazing.  It's tiny.  I'm not getting in this.  It's crazy.  It's got one of those propane things  to get us up in the air  and a couple engines  to get us moving forward.  But, hey, is that...  They bet I'm gas in it. 
[04:01:30]  I'm not going to be drifting  all over Boston.  Did you hear that guy just beep at us?  That was pretty funny, actually.  We're going to talk over here.  Okay, we are about ready to start our retaliations  against WABU.  We're climbing into the craft.  Dude, hold the phone for a second.  I've got to get this box of bra bombs  into the craft.  It's loaded up.  This is the dumbest thing  I've ever been part of, man.  Say that again.  I'm actually a little scared.  And we look stupid.  If we die,  I'm in a stupid flight suit  like Tom Cruise wore in Top Gun. 
[04:02:00]  I'm going to look like an idiot.  Oh, boy.  No.  After Top Gun,  Tom Cruise could hold his head up high.  I'm not going to look like an idiot.  You really got boozed on that last line.  I really did.  I lost myself.  I'm not going to do this.  I'm not going to die with this suit on.  Shut up.  I like the fact that as you're broadcasting,  you're like,  here, hold this.  I have to load these bras in.  Why not just do it on the soil?  Why not have guys with you  or preload it?  Don't be illogical, you ask.  We got to explain it 
[04:02:30]  like it's a movie or something.  Where's the guy that actually  filled the balloon up for you?  There was just a balloon  waiting for you in a field?  And there's also these awful,  you know how bad it is  to do like these remotes?  You guys had perfect quality  while you were moving around.  Yes, we did.  Here, hold this.  It sounds just like it did  10 seconds ago in the van  while I'm outside.  Even in the blimp,  it sounds amazing.  It never cuts out.  I don't remember this.  I would try to blank it out, too.  I was thinking that yesterday.  I don't remember doing this. 
[04:03:00]  I don't remember recording it.  I have no idea  what's going to happen next.  I feel like I'm hearing this  for the first time.  It's so weird.  It's like when you get molested.  You just buried it.  We buried it.  Let's go to Steve.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Steve.  Yeah, this sounds like  Mission Unlistenable.  Oof.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Oof.  Gone.  I'm going to look like an idiot.  Well, Anthony,  explain the craft again.  It's a Jensen AS-111. 
[04:03:30]  It's, like you said,  it's controlled by propane,  but it's got two Briggs & Stratton  10-horse engines  so we could putt around the skies in it.  The guy, Al,  gave me this, uh,  a crash course,  and I hate using the word crash,  but a crash course...  Ah, I get it.  You get what?  My drift.  Little verbal slip.  Whoa.  I hate using the word crash,  but a crash course  on how to fly.  And you're going to be  the navigator and bombardier.  This is going to be fun, actually. 
[04:04:00]  I'm scared.  If you're getting in your car  to drive home,  I would look up in the sky  because we should be getting at,  we should be getting over WABU.  within 20, 25 minutes  from right now,  and we will drop these bra bombs  on top of WABU,  like it or not.  Go for the transmitter.  Go for the transmitter.  Wow, like it or not.  That's tough talk.  I'm surprised you weren't  dropping job applications.  This guy, John, 
[04:04:30]  from Virginia,  General Hack Arthur.  Went through his one-line...  Full metal jack-offs.  Oh, boy.  Transmitter.  Go for the transmitter.  And they can't stop us.  They want to censor us.  Well, they're going to have to deal  with a little retaliation,  all right?  All right, bro,  we should rock on with some tunes.  We're jumping in the crap.  And Godspeed.  Next time you talk to us, 
[04:05:00]  we will be in the air.  Hopefully he'll be off the air soon.  Oh, shit.  Okay, terrific.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  You need to play all those together.  Well, unfortunately,  we've got to do other things today,  so we...  Try to find your dignity. 
[04:05:30]  I want to listen.  From 1996.  Yeah.  12 years ago.  Yeah, dude.  Yeah, yeah.  Brother man.  Brother man.  Don't be a mother hugger.  Hey, fella guy.  Fella guy.  When we get back.  Hey, dude sister.  We got O&A,  Airborne.  Yeah.  It's uncomfortable for anyone  to listen to this,  is what E-Rock wrote.  And what was the rest of this?  What?  What was the rest of it?  Not uncomfortable? 
[04:06:00]  Right.  It's been...  No, no.  The next clip is the reason  you're listening today.  It is...  Anthony will walk out of the studio.  I can't.  He will hide.  He will have to leave.  Dude, the bottom line is this.  I mean, we all get pushed around in life.  You guys weren't going to take it.  You are an ass, man.  I can't take you sitting here.  If I had access to a little blimp,  Jensen, was it?  You bet I'd use it.  You bet I'd use it.  I'm so glad it only takes one sense 
[04:06:30]  to listen to you guys.  If I had to taste this,  I'd smell it.  I would throw up right now.  Imagine if we really did this.  There would be just a janitor on the roof,  just annoyed,  just sweeping up bras.  Like, what did this do?  Yeah.  Gave me something to do for an hour.  Oh, we're the worst.  Well, let's say hi to Eric in New Jersey.  Eric?  Hey, what is this?  Pearl Harbel? 
[04:07:00]  Let's go to Chris in Houston.  Chris?  What's up, boy?  Hey.  Apocalypse.  All right.  We're going to take it right.  When we get back,  we will be in the air  as we look back to a show we did  12 years ago.  Bora, Bora, Bora. 
[04:07:30]  Oh, is that a good one?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Who wrote that one?  Oh, viral load.  ONA's 20th anniversary retrospective.  Retrospective.  You know, I stole the Playboy with Florida in it.  No, wait.  Florida.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  James!  James!  James!  No, no, no, no.  James, Oph, is looking at me, James.  Look, I got that big pack of hot dogs  stable to the back of my neck. 
[04:08:00]  James!  Where's J.J.?  Thelma.  Thelma was just...  You said Florida.  Everyone heard it.  Ophie had the hots for Florida  when he was a kid.  Come on, everyone heard it.  Ophie!  Come here, give us some love.  Little brown sugar, Ophie!  James!  That was only until Wheezy came along.  All right, all right.  The beauty that was Wheezy.  All right. 
[04:08:30]  Oh, if only I could be George Jefferson.  I'll move you on up.  Now you've gone too far, man.  You said it, man.  Yeah, how about that Anesta, Ophie?  Shut up.  Come here, heathen!  Oh, man.  Well, let's change the subject  and talk about Stephen Lynch.  I could never squeeze out syrup  out of that Aunt Jemima bottle  without thinking,  Wow, what a hot babe.  Yeah.  I'd lose my syrup. 
[04:09:00]  Well, you heard it here, folks.  Ophie, hots for Florida  from good times.  Stole the Playboy.  That Playboy I never saw,  but I guess it's in Ophie's  personal collection.  The one with Florida.  James, I'm naked and Playboy.  All right.  Son of a...  Look at the picture we got  on the wall.  Check this out. 
[04:09:30]  James!  Oh, man.  There she is.  It's the roll.  Wow.  She is truly dynamite.  Yeah, look at that.  Yeah.  That's chocolate thunder.  Yeah.  It just sucks  when you put your foot  in your mouth on this show,  you know?  What was Hugh Hefner  thinking that month, huh?  I don't know.  He was on the crank.  All right.  It was after the stroke.  Get me, Escalon! 
[04:10:00]  I am trying to change  the subject here so bad  because this could go on  for another three weeks.  James!  Here's the picture, Opie.  Are you feeling that tingle?  Yeah.  Here it is, O.  Time to feel free.  Not getting hassled.  Not getting hustled. 
[04:10:30]  Keeping your head on the water.  Opie loves mama.  Dino man!  Good times!  Easy credit rip-off.  Good times!  Hanging in and surviving.  Good times!  Handing and a jaw in!  Good times!  Hey, we're lucky we got him.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Good times!  Yeah!  Hope he's got good times  in his pants. 
[04:11:00]  Woo!  James!  Now, J.J., I have company  this evening.  Opie's coming over!  After James got killed,  remember that?  Yeah.  She would have liked  a guy like you.  Shut up.  You'd have fit good  in the projects.  All right.  You'd have to suffer  the scrutiny of Michael,  the younger brother.  Yes!  Yes!  Remember how angry he was.  I don't think Opie  would have cut the mustard  with his hair 
[04:11:30]  and everything.  Mama!  Why are you dating  that white boy?  He's very nice.  Now, come on.  Let Mama go out  with Opie.  James!  James!  Mama, he's the devil.  Well, he's showing  the devil in bed.  Wait till I tell  Walona what he did to me. 
[04:12:00]  Of course he can't  stack up to James,  Larry Kouse.  You know,  this picking on someone  is not that fun  after all.  I always thought  it was fun  to pick on people.  Oh, it's a blast.  Come on this side.  All right.  It's ONA's  20th anniversary  retrospective.  Get the fuck out of here!  Oh, Jesus Christ!  Jimmy, turn around.  Oh, wow!  All right. 
[04:12:30]  All right.  Holy shit!  All right.  Holy Jesus.  Mother of God.  We're in trouble.  You know something?  You got balls.  You got balls.  Bravo, Whoopi.  Whoopi Goldberg  in the studio.  Good morning.  Good to see y'all.  I understand  you've been sending  messages for me  to come in.  So I decided  I'd come up  and see y'all  because I know  you were concerned  about a couple of things 
[04:13:00]  and I really wanted  to clear it up,  you know,  because especially  the whole thing  about the,  you know,  the, what do you call it?  The, what?  The stuff that you put on your...  Oh, the sunscreen.  Yeah, the sunscreen.  Because I know  you were concerned  that black people  didn't know anything  about sunscreen.  So I thought  I'd come up  and tell you  your mamas were wrong.  They put the wrong shit on you.  You know,  let me...  So let me just  run through all of it.  All right.  So it's here.  All right.  And I'm pleased to see y'all.  I'm pleased to see y'all  this morning.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  What's up, boys?  Oh, hi, Whoopi. 
[04:13:30]  This is so amazing.  She's so amazing.  Oh, man.  This shit is like super...  No, you have no idea.  Patrice, we've been beating her up  the last three days.  She just started  doing a radio show  here in New York City.  Welcome to New York Radio.  I just saw you  the other night, by the way.  Where were you?  I was over  at the Stephen King reading.  Was that amazing?  Very, very amazing.  The three of them  just...  Yeah.  I was loving it.  I was loving it.  And let me tell you something.  I was sitting  directly up front.  I, like, got the...  I went through the auction.  Right.  You know, it's a great charity.  Right, right, right.  Went through, got front row tickets.  Right. 
[04:14:00]  I hear,  and now,  let's introduce  the star of Sister Act  and stuff.  Me and my girlfriend  looked at each other  and went,  holy shit.  Fucking Whoopi's coming out.  If she looks down,  oh, no.  I didn't expect it.  We were laughing  our asses off.  And I said,  the next day I came in  and said Whoopi  was very funny  at that podium.  It was a good night.  It was a good night.  You were in your element  and that was great.  It was very cool.  But the fact  you two guys  have been shitting 
[04:14:30]  on that show,  I mean,  should definitely  now give you pause  because she came in.  Shut the fuck up.  You were right with us.  You are an instigator.  I agree with the word with that.  And Petrie,  just keep eating  so you don't even have to talk  on this whole thing.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  You know,  I knew that I was going  to get something  from somewhere.  And so I expected  and it was cool.  It was cool.  So,  the fleas,  what do you call them?  The pests.  The past fleas.  You know,  that's funny.  Why aren't you doing  this stuff on your show? 
[04:15:00]  Because my show  is geared to women  in the morning  and that's what we're doing.  That's why  it's a whole different group.  It's a whole different group.  It certainly is.  It's a whole different group.  It certainly is.  I'm trying to be good.  Let's be honest.  Did the One Pest  get to you  as you're sitting there?  But it didn't get to me  until I left the studio  and there were  a couple guys around  and it kind of,  it made me uncomfortable  because here's the,  I can't hit anybody.  You know what I mean? 
[04:15:30]  So if somebody comes up  to do something,  my first instinct  is that they're going  to hurt me.  Right, right.  So they freaked me out  a little bit.  But no,  you know,  I'm aware of what you guys do.  You know,  I know how you work  and I've known your show.  You've been around forever.  But everybody knows that.  I know.  You know,  everybody knows that.  But you know what?  Why do they have to show off?  You ruined everything.  You really did ruin everything.  We had weeks in us.  I know you did.  I know you did.  September ready to go.  You can always come back  if we didn't do it. 
[04:16:00]  But just let me establish  the ladies first,  please.  Because here's what happened.  Because they jammed  the phone lines.  You can't talk to anybody.  All these women  got really pissed off  and said,  you know what?  If we can't talk to you,  we're not going to listen.  And that kind of  flipped everybody out.  She's asking for a truce.  No,  no,  I'm not.  I'm saying to you,  you guys have been  doing your show  for years  on both ends.  And I know that  a lot of people  are concerned.  They say,  why are you doing this?  You know the truth is, 
[04:16:30]  I can't be me  and still do the movies  I used to do  because people are  too nervous about it.  They just get paid.  You say one thing,  they're like,  oh,  we can't work.  I can't say that anymore.  So you have to kind of  just sort of,  you know,  no,  he'll always work.  Yeah.  He'll always work.  But you can't,  you know,  so I think to myself,  do I really want to go  back and forth to California  and beg for work?  And these guys said,  you know,  we're not afraid.  We'll put you on  because we're trying  to get to the women.  I said,  cool.  Stay in New York,  stay home,  have a good time.  I love you guys. 
[04:17:00]  I know you're out  there as silly as hell,  but you always have been.  You always have been.  I hate this.  Well,  Seth,  wait a minute.  It's Whoopi.  No,  you don't.  You can actually be yourselves  if you want to.  We were so excited.  Hold on.  I got to tell you.  We were so excited  that we were going  to have a new enemy.  We can't.  I know.  Now she comes in all night.  Can we trade Jimmy  for Cubby?  This is all fun,  but this is to me  what a comic is.  This is what a comic does 
[04:17:30]  as opposed to like an actor,  like a pure actor.  Yeah.  A pure actor would just hide  and this is a comic  that just comes out  and confronts it.  You know what?  I thought I might.  I thought I might.  Where's your next stop?  Beirut?  Jesus Christ.  If I can.  You know I don't fly.  You war wrecker.  I know.  I'm a bitch.  I'm a bitch.  But you know what it is?  If you understand  what folks do,  if you understand the rag  and if you know what it is,  then you can sort of deal  with it a little bit better.  But if you don't, 
[04:18:00]  and you know,  actors are sensitive  that they're not comics.  They're not comics  and so they don't have  the thick skin  that we like to think  that we have  until somebody messes with us  and then our lips poke out  and then we go,  yeah, I'm a good help.  All insecure and stuff.  Yeah.  Down deep,  all of us are like  really insecure.  So the best way  to get around it  is to just beat somebody else up.  Aren't we awful people?  Just to make ourselves feel better.  But you know what?  It's cool.  We can have our listeners  call tomorrow  and say how great you are. 
[04:18:30]  No, they won't believe it.  They won't believe it.  But just,  if you tell them to call,  it's cool to call.  Just don't physically,  don't scare me.  By the way,  is that guy going to kick our ass?  Yeah, wow.  Who is he?  He looks like he's like,  why are you doing this, Whoopi?  He's just waiting for a problem.  No.  Who is he?  This is my company partner.  You cool?  We run our company together.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  He's not loving this.  He's not like us.  He's like,  I told you not to do this.  Get it over with it.  Get the hell out of it.  No, I got to say,  should we or should we not? 
[04:19:00]  And the idea of coming up  and saying,  look,  here's what's happening.  We're all trying to,  you know,  make a little dough.  We're trying to make a living,  having some fun.  And I thought I figured,  again,  I felt like I got a lot of telegrams  from you to come over and visit.  A lot of people are saying  we're scared and stuff.  No.  No, I got to.  You want to set up balls  on this woman.  She comes in.  We respect people that,  yeah,  that come to us face to face.  What are you going to do?  We're not scared.  The woman.  Yeah,  what do you want them to hit me? 
[04:19:30]  I know, right?  The woman comes in here  and sits down  and just starts talking.  You know,  the reality is bravo.  I did just grab the mic,  didn't I?  I just grabbed the mic  and like,  okay.  Yeah,  that mic's been waiting for bravo.  Listen,  all you listeners,  all you ONA listeners,  we know that you're out there.  We know you're having a good time.  We know what you're doing.  You got to give the guys kudos, man.  You got to give them kudos.  You can't be pissed  that they're respectful.  When I'm respectful to them,  they're not going to smack me down.  What do you think they're going to do?  We do a very different show than us  and that's why it's so easy to goof on. 
[04:20:00]  Yes!  And we're not going for the same audience.  No, no, no.  But you just took away all our fun.  Yeah.  We played your demo tape this morning.  What the hell are we going to rag on now?  Do we have anybody?  We have to go back to Jim Kerr.  Oh, God.  Not Jim Kerr.  He's on 104.3.  Jim Kerr and the morning crew.  Rock station.  Or something.  I have to apologize to Whoopi.  Why?  Why did you say something really bad?  You read it in the paper.  Oh.  Oh, you call me a bitch.  You know, here's the deal.  But you have to apologize to him.  It's true.  Why? 
[04:20:30]  Why?  Because I said you don't know when I'm...  And here's what I'm talking about.  Who's going to apologize first?  Because you have to apologize to him.  I apologize.  Because you got to us a little bit  with the Howard Stern thing.  I'm sorry.  Did I really?  No, no.  No, I didn't.  Full of bananas.  Full of bananas.  We just love seeing our name in the paper.  We're in the paper again today, matter of fact.  Yes, you are.  Yeah, we're publicity whores.  We know it.  Whoopi, I apologize for calling you a bitch.  You know what?  It's okay because it's true.  You know? 
[04:21:00]  There are occasions when the B...  The B-yatch comes out of me.  See, you know what it is?  I'm trying to remember all the stuff  I'm not supposed to say,  but I'm okay because I'm on it.  Oh, it's a satellite.  So I'm like, okay, don't say...  Figure out a better way to say...  It's a lot of new stuff.  Just forget all about satellite radio  when you go in tomorrow.  Yes, yes, because when I go in tomorrow,  I'll be like,  Hey, motherfucker.  Welcome to Wake Up with fucking Whoopi.  I could get in a little bit of a jam.  I could get in a little bit of a jam.  By the way, that goddamn little theme 
[04:21:30]  was stuck in our head all morning.  Which one?  Because we played it all morning.  We played it all morning.  Do we have it here?  Wake Up with Whoop.  How'd it go?  Whoop.  We don't have it here.  Is it all...  Well, no one knew you were coming.  It's all waking up with Whoopi.  You know.  It's like a little jingle thing.  What?  Is it the...  We kept playing it.  The jazzy one?  The one that's...  Yeah, it's almost jazzy.  Like almost an old-time jingle  with a couple of voices in there and stuff.  And it got stuck in our heads.  We were cursing you.  Are you really going to try a nice show, though?  As a comic, you've got such an edge to you. 
[04:22:00]  That's what I don't understand.  You know what it is?  When I go do my stuff, it's mine.  When I'm working for...  It's like doing the Oscars.  When I'm working for them, I can be funny,  but I'm on that mill.  I'm on the treadmill.  When you're doing a show in front of some Democrats, too.  Well, actually...  No.  Were you there?  No, I was not there.  See, I wish I could find somebody who was there  because, in fact...  Wait, what are you talking about, by the way?  She kind of ripped into the Republican...  I actually didn't.  Or it was reported.  It was reported. 
[04:22:30]  And that's the most interesting thing about this.  It doesn't have to be true anymore.  Yeah.  Someone can say something, and it's right there,  and people run with it.  And then when it's not true, they say,  Oh, we're really sorry it wasn't true.  But when they're saying it, it's like,  Hey, what did she do?  But it's not that I hadn't done it.  I didn't do it that night.  I don't mind taking heed for stuff I do.  But blame me when I do it.  Yeah.  You know?  So it was a little bit disingenuous on their part  to sort of make a big deal.  You've been known to pick on a few people, though,  and be a little potty-mouthed sometimes. 
[04:23:00]  I have no problem with potty-mouthed.  I love potty-mouthed.  Yeah.  And I'm mostly on politicians from either side.  But see, whenever one side is talking about  how much of a potty-mouth I have  and how much I rag on them,  they never mention that I rag on the other side as well.  I rag on everybody, because they're all full of poo-poo to me.  You get that sometimes.  We'll be talking, and then you'll get like the...  You see what I just said?  Poo-poo.  You can say shit.  What happened to me?  Just say shit.  The left will call you like a right-wing lunatic,  and then you say something else, and then you get... 
[04:23:30]  And then the other side.  Yeah, the next feedback you get is the same thing from the other side.  You know, it's never-ending.  And after 20 years, I know this.  You know, and you kind of go,  Yes, okay, I know this is going to happen.  But, you know, when I'm doing my stuff,  when it's my stuff,  when nobody else has to take any heat for it  or any responsibility for it,  then I can go berserk.  But when it's about something else,  that's what I'm going to do.  It's not so much that it's a nice show,  but look at this, man.  Look at all these papers.  I can't look at them anymore. 
[04:24:00]  I can't handle it anymore.  That's just it.  Like, now you've only been on a couple of days,  but is it hard to steer away from that?  I mean, there's got to be some days where you wake up and go,  God, I just want to rip this guy apart.  Well, Wednesdays are my days to just...  Because we call it Kvetch Wednesday.  And Peeves, people of Peeves.  You have to give every day a name.  Yeah, Manners Monday.  Yeah.  We heard Manners Monday.  Manners Monday.  What was Tuesday?  Tuesday, you don't remember?  Full everyone with, fuck them, Friday. 
[04:24:30]  Speaking of which,  have you guys done...  Have you gone and had your prostate checked?  All joking aside.  Let me tell you.  First one was last year.  I just went back.  In three months now,  is my next year,  and I have to go get the...  Yeah.  It's not fun, Whoopi.  It's not fun, but you know what?  It's not fun.  Do you know how many people have...  I've lost so many male friends  that it's become really like a pain-in-the-ass crusade for me.  Literally.  But I'm tired of...  Yeah.  For a penurex.  Not mine.  Mine is fine.  And I picked a doctor for his credentials. 
[04:25:00]  You should go in first.  You should have to see if he's like,  yes, LaMada.  You know?  It's so true.  It's so true.  You know, I want a little pencil-finger guy.  Knock your pencil-finger.  Find a midget.  Did you knock...  Did you...  Have you had it?  No, not yet.  Please do it.  Please, please, please.  I'm only 27, though, so...  It doesn't...  These days, it doesn't matter.  Yeah.  I'm going soon, actually.  My youngest friend, who has had it, was 25.  Oh, boy.  What's the symptoms?  I don't know.  That's why you have to go in and get a PSA check.  I really don't know.  But Patrice was just talking about how ugly his ass is. 
[04:25:30]  You know what?  I think it's okay.  I think it's okay.  As long as you don't ask anybody to kiss it, it should be fine.  But a doctor is going to really not like...  That's got to be a bad day for a doctor.  I didn't say my asshole was ugly.  I said my ass cheeks.  When you come in for a prostate exam, that's got to be like a bad day for a doctor.  Fuck, man.  Not really.  Not if it's clean.  I'm just saying.  I just wanted to know the symptoms.  But she's just...  This young lad comes in.  Frequent urination and things like that? 
[04:26:00]  I think that's a large prostate.  But you need to go and look.  You made me go...  We flew back from L.A. one time, and I pissed so much.  He's like, you should be checked for diabetes.  He panicked me.  I went and...  I've been checked like three times since then for diabetes.  You're a hypochondriac.  No, I just pee a lot.  I am too, though.  I can't watch House, that goddamn show.  So Jim Curry is a hangnail.  House now has to kill three babies to save one.  What?  What the hell?  What did he...  I got that.  Can everybody that has a problem with you guys now come in to the station and apologize? 
[04:26:30]  Yeah, because we are pussies in that way.  Can Jim Curry come in and say, hey, we don't even know what he does.  Richard Huff.  I didn't know that name out.  Just start throwing that out.  Richard Huff is a writer that wrote the story about us in the Daily News this morning.  We had a problem with him.  He bashed the pests in our show and stuff a little bit.  Had a problem with him.  Got him on the phone.  By the end of the conversation...  He was best friends.  Pals.  We can't stand when people confront us.  So the secret is don't meet anybody because that's the way it is. 
[04:27:00]  Lock the doors for now on.  Whoopi Goldberg, let's be honest here.  She's been around ever since Around the World and 80 motherfucking days.  The whole story.  You understand?  So when you see her, she becomes real.  Just like if Mel Gibson with his goofy face and his Jew remarks comes in here, you could  not bash him like you do on the radio.  Oh, you know, that Nuremberg trial thing really was a little over John Mel.  I don't understand.  Hey, I agree with you.  I feel the same way about those Jews and their English. 
[04:27:30]  He was just annexing what was his.  We're going to have to lock the doors for now on.  You can't have it.  It happens.  No matter who comes in, you can't just go, oh, now you're here, motherfucking Whoopi.  Right.  What was with that tag dancing shit motherfucking years ago?  No, you got to come in there and you just, I just bring it up old shit.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What happened?  Is it, let me, can I ask you a question?  Maybe.  Did you say it or what, are you, do you have a problem with Oprah?  No. 
[04:28:00]  I've never had an Oprah problem.  What did I read about Oprah not inviting you to something?  A big woman thing.  And you was upset or somebody thought she was upset?  No, people, no, people keep asking me how come you're not there.  I keep saying because it's her thing and she didn't invite me.  That's okay with, you know, if you, if it's your party.  Right.  I can't be pissed off that you didn't invite me to your party.  But you know her for, I mean.  No, I don't.  Here's the thing.  The color purple.  All black people don't know each other.  No, but you, you, all, no, no.  You know the color purple together.  Yeah, but that was 21 years ago. 
[04:28:30]  We don't hang up.  We don't, we don't hang out.  We, it's, you know, it's just, we're not, we're not, we're acquaintances.  Very, very mild acquaintances.  So, no, it's not something that I'm part of with her and it's cool.  It wasn't her party for like very influential or powerful black women.  Wasn't that the theme of it?  Mm-hmm.  Well then, I mean, even if you're not close anymore, I mean, you certainly fit into that  list.  I mean.  Well, perhaps I do.  And when she gets around to her list and she changes it, I guess I'll get the invitation.  Where'd you go?  Um, I don't know. 
[04:29:00]  Good, good.  That's good.  She has no idea what she has started.  The pests are going to turn on us today as soon as she leaves.  I know.  Now we're going to get the wrath.  You're kissing her ass.  We're going to get the wrath.  Oh, please.  What's up with you pests?  Yeah, exactly.  Pests, get a life.  Be nice.  You've been mean to me.  Wait, wait, no.  I've got to talk to the pests.  I didn't talk to the hand.  Listen, listen.  It's like Mongo.  Don't shoot him.  You'll just make him mad.  Don't do it.  Pests, you have been doing some mean stuff to me down around the building that I'm in. 
[04:29:30]  There's no reason for y'all to walk up on me the way that you have.  Did they?  No reason at all.  So, Pests, I don't mind.  I like the boys.  The boys, they're doing what they're doing.  But y'all don't have to scare, physically scare me.  There's no reason for it.  Don't physically scare.  Whoopi, I've been telling you guys for three days to knock this off.  I could just let other people be in a show.  They don't listen because they want to be in the paper and it's hurtful.  Jimmy, I please see.  Yes, baby.  Could you thank us?  Tomorrow?  Yeah, because for the last three days, we gave you a lot of attention on New York radio. 
[04:30:00]  And I think your thank you is in order.  Didn't you hear me say good morning to all?  Because even negative publicity is good.  You know that.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  Bad publicity is good.  That's what they told me when I read ONA fired on the cover of the paper.  It's like, yeah, that's good.  Will you thank us tomorrow on your show?  I will.  I will.  I think you deserve it.  Can I give you all my best and tell you thanks for making it at least fun out of me?  Thank you so much.  And I'll see you. 
[04:30:30]  Can I come back sometime?  Yeah.  Okay.  You can absolutely come back.  Do you mind, though, if a couple times if you hit on a subject, can we just kind of talk about it a little bit?  Please do.  If we're nice.  Please do.  No, and even if you're tearing into shreds, it's cool.  It's cool.  Thanks for showing the rest of the country that we're a bunch of pussies.  We really are shit talkers anonymously.  We're just cowards.  We get behind the screen door with our mother and yell something and then hide.  I'm just sissy.  I saw her coming toward the door and I just went.

[04:52:30]  Two decades ago, radio's greatest duo started in Long Island and quickly moved to Boston to craft a career  Who knew that the Mayor's family is fans of the Opie and Anthony show?  What's getting out of hand?  Well, I think we're going into the game, though  This is one of our guys!  They moved to New York to completely take over the industry 
[04:53:00]  This is the Alderman  Oh my god, that's horrible  Oh no, oh my god  Then revolutionized the medium on satellite radio  You said I don't believe in the Constitution  You said I don't believe in the Constitution?  My guys, my Jess  He rocked his attempt  He is a destroyer  You make a little mustache with baby shit 
[04:53:30]  The time has come to learn from the best  As for the first time, Opie and Anthony are being unmasked  Live from Caroline's Broadway New York City  This is Opie and Anthony are being unmasked  And now your host, Ron Bennington  Opie and Anthony are being unmasked 
[04:54:00]  O.A.! O.A.! O.A.!! O.A.! O.A.! O.A.!  Wow. Nice.  Oh, I love that.  That was nice.  I thought you guys hated us. 
[04:54:30]  You know, it was 20 years ago.  Shut the fuck up.  No, that was nice.  I thought they were bringing out the new Marvel characters for a summer blockbuster.  Yeah, what kind of intro is that?  I was like, is this about the moon landing?  Something very important?  But it is 20 years.  It's 20 years.  It sure is, Ron.  It sure is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me just seriously think back 20 years ago.  Would this be the dream where you guys got less than the dream more than the dream? 
[04:55:00]  Caroline's on Broadway?  Yeah, Caroline's on Broadway.  It's the dream.  Yeah.  By the way, I just want to point this out.  Anthony ate so much backstage free food that it was frightening.  I did.  I had a pizza.  I had a shrimp cocktail.  I had a calamar.  Ribs.  Ribs.  French fries.  That's what happened.  Because I haven't eaten in three days.  I was on a bender.  It was the John Candy buffet he had.  It really was nice. 
[04:55:30]  My God.  The commemorative Caroline's John Candy buffet, yes.  Women were crying.  Don't.  That's enough.  Stop it.  He's just hurting himself.  He's hurting himself.  But honestly, where you guys got in 20 years, is this more or less than what you would have thought?  What you wanted?  It's been a roller coaster.  Yeah.  On a graph, it would go.  And now we're sort of on the way up again.  Maybe.  No, it's been a roller coaster ride.  That's for sure. 
[04:56:00]  Yeah.  It's one of those situations where I think everything came into play at a certain time.  We were at the right time, the right talent, the right chemistry.  Ooh, the right talent.  I like that.  That's the one.  I like that.  Just perfect amount of talent.  Yeah.  But something that becomes successful at one time can't at another.  In the 90s, when we first started getting together and doing radio, I think that was really a time that was great for what we were doing. 
[04:56:30]  And now I think it's a lot more difficult because there's so many other options for entertainment.  You could literally see beheadings and a cute little kitten hitting a ball of yarn.  It's adorable.  All in the same sight.  Yeah.  I don't think it was supposed to last this long, Ronnie.  Is that right?  Well, in radio, you never get a chance to have a career this long.  I'm kind of surprised by the longevity of it.  Well, how long was your radio career before you hooked up? 
[04:57:00]  Want me to leave?  I started at 18 years old, so I did a good 10 beforehand.  Did you ever work with any other partners?  Well, there was Pete from around the corner.  I came in like Gorman, and he was Sergeant Barnes.  I was always...  No one watched Platoon, you faggots?  What's wrong with you?  Fuck!  Well, you know what happened?  Play reference.  Get on you!  I'm going to give this away for the radio audience. 
[04:57:30]  Yeah.  The warm-up guy was so depressing that nobody wants to move now.  Unbelievable.  He threatened people with expulsion.  We're just trying to get the energy back in the room.  Thanks, Sam.  Sam Roberts, everyone.  I thought he was for the Hot 97 show after this.  See?  Because you're half black.  But what half?  No one knows. 
[04:58:00]  Oh, no.  That's not his dick.  No, back in the day, I always worked with a radio crew, but I knew I wanted to get some  official people to stick around.  Right.  And then 20 years ago in the summer, actually, Anthony's brother is the one responsible.  Yeah, Brother Joe's here.  Where's his brother Joe?  The motherfucker.  I think he really has a huge responsibility in this disaster. 
[04:58:30]  I think Brother Joe is expecting it to be the O.P., Anthony, and Joe show, though.  He was.  Whoopsie.  Sorry, Joe.  Yeah, Joe.  Yeah, I'll be right home.  Off to Boston.  Fuck you.  I kind of see him as being Doc in Back to the Future.  Yeah.  If it wasn't for him, none of this would happen.  None of this would have happened.  He was the motivated one.  Yeah.  He really was.  I was at WBAB, one of the many homes of rock and rolls I worked at. 
[04:59:00]  Ronnie understands that.  Sure.  And I was doing just a very easy bit.  It was the O.J. trial.  And I just wanted parody songs from all the local bands about the trial.  And one night, some lunatic is knocking on the back door over and over again.  And I sent one of my guys, I'm like, just see what they want.  There were always people coming and going.  And it was Brother Joe.  And he would not give this cassette to anyone except me.  Just the cassette is enough right now. 
[04:59:30]  We know how long ago it is.  It was a single.  Right.  So I threw on 30 minutes of nonstop rock to go meet Brother Joe.  And he goes, hey, man, I think you might want to, you know, check this out from our band Rot Gut.  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, thanks.  And I was getting a ton of these songs.  And I played it.  And it was the famous good electric shot go.  I, yeah. 
[05:00:00]  I said it was right.  But it's like, can I be, yeah?  I, yeah.  Yes.  And I was often used to put on it.  Yeah.  I thought that was right.  Yeah, well, I did.  But and she, I, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I was like, yeah.  I hope that it's제.  And I was like, you know, yeah.  And I was like, yeah. </pre>
