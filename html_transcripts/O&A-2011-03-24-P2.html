<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with Sam Roberts recapping the day's events, highlighting the failed attempt to have Penthouse Pet of the Year Nikki Benz perform a pole dance due to the studio's unsuitable ceiling.  This resulted in Roland, the show's guest booker, initially facing repercussions but ultimately receiving a lap dance from Nikki Benz as recompense for a prior incident where she'd hit him with a belt.

The show then featured a tumultuous phone call with Tommy Lee.  The conversation started with Lee discussing his infamous sex tape with Pamela Anderson, but quickly deteriorated into a shouting match after Opie and Anthony jokingly questioned the size of his penis and mentioned Anderson's claim that he gave her Hepatitis C.  Lee hung up, then called back angrily, accusing the hosts of telling him not to discuss Anderson, a claim they denied.  The exchange continued with mutual insults and accusations before Lee hung up again.

Opie's recent Twitter behavior was discussed, revealing his penchant for "sniping" â€“ making insulting tweets targeting random people involved in trending topics. He also recounted finding what appeared to be dental floss or a tampon string in his turkey chili.

A comedic segment featured a clip of Rich Voss's surprise stand-up performance at Rue 57 during the "Starbucks Comedy Tour."  Voss's success in engaging a small, initially disinterested audience was discussed, drawing comparisons to a similar scene in the movie *Source Code*.

The show concluded with Roland previewing the upcoming week's guest lineup: Danny McBride, Colin Quinn with Norm MacDonald, and Howie Mandel. He also mentioned the Ron & Fez show's upcoming "Live Unmasked" event featuring Lisa Lampanelli.  Finally, the hosts briefly discussed J.J. Abrams and the ending of *Lost*.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live. I'm Sam Roberts.  It's a very busy day in here.  There's literally engineers that were just in here.  I mean, they found out we were going live, so they scampered out of here.  But they were just in here on their hands and knees,  doing God knows what, crawling around under this console. 
[00:00:30]  We're in here trying to clean up the studio.  Opie and Anthony are gone.  Roland chased after ONA trying to pitch guests  because he kind of gets that period of time  between the time they leave the studio  to the time they walk to the elevator  to try to get out as much information as he can.  I don't know, maybe at some point today  we'll get an update from Roland because he was just in here.  Nikki Benz was in here, the Penthouse Pet of the Year,  and she gave Roland a lap dance  because the pole didn't work in the studio. 
[00:01:00]  The pole was something that was with her coming in.  When she was pitched to the show, it was,  hey, Nikki Benz wants to come in.  She'll bring the new Penthouse pole with her,  and we'll put it up in the studio, and she'll do a dance.  And, you know, whatever, get naked and get on the pole.  Now, this is what Roland pitched,  and what Roland pitches has to become gospel  because O&A are ready to just, you know, blow anything up,  as you know, at this point.  So Roland panics when things start going wrong, 
[00:01:30]  and he realized today that the pole wasn't going to make it.  He was fighting for it.  In our meetings on Tuesday, he was saying,  yeah, we'll put the pole up in the studio.  We'll just balance it on the floor.  And we were all trying to tell him,  Roland, there's no bass for it.  How long is this music going to last for?  It's been going for three minutes,  and just the same, da-da-da-da.  Thank you, E-Rock.  But the pole, you were saying it'll balance on the floor.  There's no bass to the pole.  See, what it is, it's one of those things 
[00:02:00]  where you have to secure it from the floor to the ceiling  to make sure it's tight.  We have a dropped ceiling,  and so today when Roland realized it just isn't happening,  there's no way to get the pole up in here  because of the dropped ceiling,  he started panicking.  We should have just put it side to side  and made her do it like a balance beam.  Ken, do you think it would have extended that long  through the entire studio?  I think, because this studio's not like a perfect square.  No.  It kind of closes in towards the area that you're in there.  We probably could have put it over the console. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, I see.  Yeah, where it gets more narrow.  Yeah.  And then have her...  She could have just swung around there,  walked around, done some splits.  Or even, yeah, just stripped naked and balanced.  That's hot.  I love a stripper who can balance well.  Well, Roland, E-Rock, as you know,  he was panicking around here  because he was afraid that they weren't going to take her  when they realized that we're not getting a pole up today.  So I talked to him before Nicky came in.  Roland, Nicky Benz is coming in today.  I thought she was supposed to get on the stripper pole.  She was, yes.  Well, they sent the stripper pole.  They did.  How do you propose that we put it up? 
[00:03:00]  Well, I thought they had the thing,  easily just put it to the roof, to the floor.  We have dropped ceilings.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  You didn't look up before?  I just thought it was silly to hold her  so she could spin around.  But there's no base on the pole.  Yeah, I was told that, yes.  So what's the pole going to balance on?  I thought it was going to balance on the floor  where you tighten it, like it won't move. 
[00:03:30]  To the ceiling?  Yeah, and the floor.  We have dropped ceilings.  I know, I know.  So, what are we going to do with that pole?  They're probably shoving up my ass.  Are you worried that the Nicky Benz thing  is going to go wrong because there's no pole?  You betcha's hers and your sweet tits, yes.  Are you panicking about this now?  Yes.  You're a beaten man, Roland.  I am.  Have a nice day anyway.  Thanks.  Yeah, Roland, physics is not his strong suit. 
[00:04:00]  Guest booking is.  You know what I was thinking, too?  No, of course not.  The big problem, as we were focusing on,  is that it can't hook to anywhere on the ceiling.  Right.  But these are fake floors.  This is a raised floor with tiles.  Like, you can lift up each square  to get to wiring or outlets or whatever.  So wouldn't the floor couldn't have...  The floor could have caved.  Yeah, the floor would have caved in  and the ceiling would have been punctured.  It was just no way.  Roland didn't check in on this at all whatsoever.  He just figured, yeah, we'll just put a pole up.  I think he's still pitching guests  and blocking them from the elevator 
[00:04:30]  because I really want to find out how it went  because when we didn't have a pole,  Roland, instead of getting punished,  ended up getting a lap dance from Nicky Benz.  Oh, there he is.  Yeah, come on in, Roland.  Come on in.  Oh, Nicky's still here.  Hi, Nicky.  Yeah, come on in.  Roland, how did you end up  getting rewarded instead of punished  for what happened?  Like, Nicky, Roland was supposed to be punished  because he's the one who said,  we'll get the pole in here. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  And then Nicky will come and dance on it.  And he said, yeah, we'll have the pole.  Don't worry.  And then, like, two days ago,  we were like, Roland,  this pole won't work in the studio.  And he goes, don't worry.  We'll get it up.  And then we realized there's no possible way.  Right, and we tried.  We tried it with everything we could.  But do you think it was fair  that Roland ended up getting a reward,  like a lap dance from you  instead of getting punished?  Well, it is fair because the last time I was on,  I smacked him pretty hard with a belt.  That's true.  So I felt like I had to redeem myself. 
[00:05:30]  Roland, which did you enjoy more,  the lap dance or getting smacked really hard with a belt?  Both.  You did.  And you were expecting the worst  because I talked to you before this,  and we played the clip a minute ago,  you thought they were going to shove the pole up your ass.  I did.  Yes, I did, yes.  Were you surprised when they were like,  okay, we'll just have her dance on Roland.  Well, she brought it up, so God bless you.  Yeah, you did.  You saved Roland,  and, I mean, you saved the segment.  So thank you for doing that.  Did you enjoy your time on O&A today? 
[00:06:00]  Absolutely.  I always do.  Fantastic.  Well, Nikki Benz and Roland,  somehow you made it out of this one again.  So congratulations to you.  Other from you.  Yes.  Way to go, Roland.  Now, Roland,  the only person who's more probably slimy at this point than you  is Chris Brown.  We played his audio earlier.  He's misunderstood.  He is.  I know.  You feel for him, don't you?  I get angry, too.  I want to demolish the dressing room.  Well, he was talking when he was apologizing about the talking points  that he sends out, 
[00:06:30]  which reminded O&A of when Tommy Lee tried to give them talking points.  And so they did not abide by the talking points.  Don't call me a pussy.  Right.  This is basically a clip that if Tommy Lee had been in studio,  he would have punched out a window.  Instead, he just hung up on Opie and Anthony.  It's Tommy Lee on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  John Holt, stay there, but we've got to go right to the hotline.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy.  Tommy!  Who, me?  Yeah.  Mr. Lee. 
[00:07:00]  What's up, Tommy?  What's up, guys?  No, we were just talking to everybody about paying for it.  I know.  I heard the conversation.  Yeah, escorts and hookers and stuff.  I have to assume you've done that a couple of times at least.  I think everyone should own one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  When you're Tommy Lee, you don't have to, though.  Yeah, see, that's just it.  You go out, you pick up some chick.  He's a rock star, and he has a mule the size of a small community.  Everyone knows about that.  Everyone's seen that on the tape. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, that made for some great Thanksgiving viewing, Tommy.  I'm so glad that we get to talk to you today, because I've always wanted to thank you.  We brought that tape to Thanksgiving dinner, swear to God, and watched it upstairs while  mom and sis and the aunts were cooking the turkey.  We all went upstairs to see you rail, Pam.  You perverts.  You perverts.  You know something, though?  You're lucky.  You're lucky that you were endowed like that, because it was a big hit.  People saw the tape and went, wow, look at Tommy Lee's hog. 
[00:08:00]  And you could have been one of those guys, a little puny thing, and then you'd be going  through life embarrassed.  Yeah.  Okay.  You've got to be psyched at that gun out there.  Who are you kidding?  Hell yeah.  If I got a 14-incher, I want the world to know.  I'd be happy with six.  Hey, Tommy, I've got to ask you.  I saw Pam on, what the hell was she on last night?  CNN?  Larry King.  Larry King.  Why are we even talking about the P word? 
[00:08:30]  Because she was claiming that.  I got to go, guys.  Bye.  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  He hangs up for talking about Pam?  What a faggot.  What a dick.  All right.  Tommy Lee, officially an ass wipe.  Why would he hang up?  Why would he hang up?  You were tooling, are you idiot?  Hey, it got out on video.  You were married.  No one doesn't know.  Why are we bringing up the P word?  He wants to promote some golf tournament.  Wow, that's exciting, radio.  Let's talk about a golf tournament. 
[00:09:00]  Want to talk about her and her goddamn hep?  And the fact that she says Tommy gave it to him?  What gave it to her?  What is wrong with these people?  Did Tommy Lee lose his mind?  I didn't see if you were being nasty.  Did he lose his friggin' mind?  He wasn't even happy that we brought up the sex tape.  I was complimenting the guy.  I gotta go.  Then go.  Go F yourself.  Have a sense of humor about it.  You jack off.  Like, anyone wants to hear about anything else that you're doing. 
[00:09:30]  You're not exactly at the peak of your music career right now.  We want to talk about the sex you had.  We want to talk about the hep C.  The hep thing, Pam.  Does she have a big C?  The interesting stuff.  Want to ask why you didn't have a lifeguard at the party?  We'll plug your crap.  We'll plug it.  Yeah.  Why don't you stick that mammoth mule in the pool and let the kid climb out on it?  Come on.  Why are we going to sit there and plug stuff and not get something that would be worthwhile 
[00:10:00]  for this program?  Like, talk about Pam.  He should have used his schlong to separate the shallow end from the deep end in the pool.  Like that thing they put across the pool.  When you hit the throbbing vein, turn back, children.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Tommy.  You want to jumpstart your career?  Start talking.  Talk.  Start talking.  That's what doesn't.  Guess what?  Your name will be in the papers again.  It's a known formula that works. 
[00:10:30]  Tommy.  Yeah.  Tommy.  What's up, man?  Hey, why you guys call me a dick, dude?  What's up?  What's up?  Because you called up.  Like, we want to talk to you about a little bit of everything, and you hung up.  You know what?  You hold on.  You were told not to bring up the people.  What do you do?  No one told us anything.  Hey, Tommy, no one tells us what to do, first of all.  And you were the big.  No one tells us what to do.  No one told us not to bring up Pam's name. 
[00:11:00]  We would never agree to that, okay?  Yes, yes, you were.  You were the big pussy for hanging up after we asked about it instead of trying to talk your way out of it.  You guys did agree to it.  We did not.  My tour manager talked to your producer.  That's bullshit.  Nope.  Nope.  We would never agree to that.  Sorry.  That's kind of a big story that we wanted to hear about.  You know what, guys?  What year are you guys living in?  It's like, dude, turn the page, guys.  I've been divorced for three years.  Turn the page. 
[00:11:30]  Turn the page.  It was big news last night when she was on Larry King accusing you of this.  Don't you think it's a current story if Pam is on Larry King saying pretty much that you gave her hep C?  What was big news, guys?  What was big news?  Big news that she's on Larry King accusing you of giving her a hep C.  Dude, you know how many months ago she accused me of that?  It doesn't matter.  It happened last night on Larry King.  Of course we're going to bring it up.  She talked about it last night.  You know what?  She talked about it in some other stupid magazines as well. 
[00:12:00]  Who cares?  Yeah, but this is the first time we're talking to you, so we'd like to maybe talk to you about it.  Maybe get your side of the story.  You've never really given your side of the story, right?  You know why?  Because it's nobody's business.  Well, she's made it everyone's business.  Of course she is.  She's an idiot.  I would just love to hear your side of it.  That's all.  If an ex is accusing me of some crazy things, you know what?  I'm going on the biggest program I can find and calling her a liar, a C, a twat. 
[00:12:30]  Every name I could figure out.  Guys, I don't do that.  That's not my style, okay?  I don't do that crap.  That's why I just hung up the phone.  I was like, you know what?  I got to go.  Because that's not my style, guys.  It may be your style, but it ain't mine.  But you look like a pussy just hanging up.  We were totally confused.  You didn't even say the first time you were on the phone, hey, guys, I thought we agreed to this.  You know what?  I'm telling you man to man that it never got to us, that we couldn't talk about Pam.  Because you know what?  We wouldn't have agreed to this interview. 
[00:13:00]  You call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  Pussy.  Jesus.  Wow, we need Tommy Lee to make a good radio show.  If you say that, I'll take my ball and not play?  I know, man.  You know, Pussy.  You don't want to talk about it.  I'm very open-minded.  Let me tell you something.  If we started talking about it and he just told us what he told us there, look, this is what she's saying.  I don't like going in that direction.  To me, it's old news. 
[00:13:30]  I'd rather just not really get into it.  It would have been like, all right, that's pretty much his side of it.  If he doesn't want to dwell on it.  And us being us, we might poke at it a little more and make a goof about it.  I'm sure Jim will say some tasteless thing into the mic about it.  But you know something?  He didn't.  He just hung up and it was like, what's he doing?  You call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  Oh, boy, Jersey Bob here says, if I type in pussy, he'll disconnect from the internet.  Wait a minute.  There you go, Jersey Bob. 
[00:14:00]  You were told.  You were told.  I'm told?  Tommy, maybe you should do your research on Ant and I.  No one tells us what to do.  I don't like being told.  Believe me.  You call.  I've been told enough.  You see the hesitation?  He's like, oh, my God, he called me a pussy.  Now I've got to hang up.  Yeah, no one else saw that.  All of a sudden he goes, you call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  Pussy.  And also I'm just looking and you know he was confused like, oh, ass.  Now I've got to hang up.  I called him out on it.  You should have told him I will not have an ultimatum put to me. 
[00:14:30]  It was that delayed.  Oh, brother.  Oh, wow.  Now I've got to hang up and I really need to promote this new CD.  Now what do I do?  I guess I've got to hang up.  He's living in a bubble.  You know what I mean?  He says, what year are you living in?  That was three years ago.  No, it's still, like Ope said, when you see her on Larry King the night before talking  about it, you would think, all right, for our side alone, just for this radio, it would 
[00:15:00]  be interesting to hear his rebuttal on the whole thing.  So we're obligated to ask.  Even if his rebuttal is, I don't want to talk about it, that's not how I do things.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Then we get into other things.  He's talking like this Larry King interview happened six months ago.  Yeah, we talk about the Motley Crue days.  You were told.  There's plenty of other things to talk about.  You were told.  Go F yourself.  Told.  E, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, Ope?  Hey.  Ope, I want to congratulate you on your new balls. 
[00:15:30]  Why are my new ones?  I don't know, man.  And I'm a little disappointed in you, man.  What?  And when he hung up the first time, you were digging into him, man.  Then he called back, you said the guy should have fired right at him, man.  Dude, listen to me on this.  First of all, it's the Ope and Anthony show, and I went.  Yeah, you're right.  That's all that is.  If I didn't go, I guarantee my pal here Ant was going.  You know what makes good radio?  It was just I beat him to the punch because we were both to the point we had it.  You know what makes good radio?  Two people not yelling over each other, especially when a third is on the phone. 
[00:16:00]  What we identify and know what to do, when one person's speaking, the other person has  to back off because you don't want to hear this.  Go ahead, Ope.  Start, just say anything.  Hey, Tommy, what the hell is it?  You know something?  You don't want to talk about anything.  It's like, August 10th?  It doesn't sound good.  August 10th.  I mean, he's a fucking, he's a husband anyway.  Oh, hey, hey, hey.  No one cares about him.  Goddamn Norton, man.  All righty, thanks.  All righty.  You were told.  You were told not to call this program with those words. 
[00:16:30]  He could have even said pending litigation.  Perhaps that would have, you know, okay.  And use that one.  Pending litigation.  It worked well for you when I was trying to, because I had a job to do when you were going  through your mess.  I was prying you to see how far I could get you to go.  And on the air, I would say, because it's true, it was, you know, pending litigation.  Perhaps there's some kind of lawsuits being filed that he can't talk about.  I don't know.  Unless he tells us, you know, what do we know?  We're going to talk about it.  The guy doesn't understand that after Motley Crue, the biggest thing he's known for is 
[00:17:00]  a porno movie with his ex-wife, Pamela.  That's the biggest goddamn thing.  Hey, here's some excitement.  Tommy Lee, Never a Dull Moment.  The name of the new CD.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  After Opie and Anthony Live, I'm Sam Roberts.  In honor of GMA pissing off Chris Brown, that was Opie and Anthony pissing off Tommy  Lee.  Roland, you just came back in here without Nikki Benz, who was with you the last time. 
[00:17:30]  What did you say to her in the hallway you just told me?  I said, please come back again soon.  What did you say, though?  Next time you're here.  Next time you're here, feel free to call to get you back in the studio.  You didn't say anything about your pee-pee?  No, I didn't.  Are you sure about that?  Because I don't use words like pee-pee, so for me to accuse you of saying something  about your pee-pee would probably mean that you told me something while the bit was playing.  It was between you and me, man.  Okay.  What did you not say?  I said, have a good day. 
[00:18:00]  Did you get excited while she was dancing on you?  Yes.  Yes, you did.  It's not something you could help.  It's a physical reaction, isn't it?  And then seeing Mars, like, bite his teeth and lick his lips, man, I don't know, I don't know.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  He could do a felony.  And what was he, while you were getting a lap dance?  Yeah, I looked up and he's like, yeah, like, you're getting into it.  Mars was licking his lips at you while you were getting a lap dance?  It looked that way to me.  It was awkward.  Our engineer.  Oh, he is?  That's what, yeah, Mars. 
[00:18:30]  That's what he does here.  Oh, I just see him here sitting down next to me.  So, okay, if you say so.  Oh, licking your lips.  Yeah, because he all of a sudden became a camera guy.  Well, he was videoing for me because I had to run in the office to do something.  Oh, because, I know, he just stood there and, like, kind of poking the roof.  He was like, this doesn't move.  This doesn't move.  He was trying to install the stripper pole.  That was his profession.  That's his job.  Roland, I don't know if you've been following.  We just played Opie and Anthony pissing off Tommy Lee. 
[00:19:00]  For whatever reason, when Opie gets, like, bored, he likes to piss people.  He likes to get under people's skin.  And on his Twitter, I noticed after Liz Taylor died, he started retweeting people saying R.I.P. Elizabeth Taylor and stuff like that and insulting him.  Like, you know, a random Twitter person, JVNC, I don't know who it is, said, R.I.P. Elizabeth Taylor, Michael Jackson's waiting for you.  And Opie retweeted them and then said, look for him in the nursery.  And just, like, it's you giggling to yourself. 
[00:19:30]  You look like a little boy when you do that.  It makes you happy to hear that.  It does.  And then Jane Fonda writes, I knew Elizabeth Taylor and can tell you she was kind, brave, generous, and loyal.  I'm sad.  Opie responded, did you tweet that from Gaddafi's lap?  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  You like that?  Did you see Jim Jefferies?  No.  What did he say?  He said, oh, that bitch was still alive?  Yeah, but Opie is not only retweeting celebrities, he's retweeting random people and insulting them. 
[00:20:00]  So I tried to grab him before he left, in between you pitching guests, to find out why is he doing this.  Opie, I was following you on Twitter after the show yesterday.  Who are these people?  You were tweeting about Liz Taylor.  Who are these people you're attacking?  A complete stranger, Sam.  Here's the deal.  I've got to finally admit this.  I'm very obsessed with Twitter these days because, you know, I've got a young son.  He's about ten and a half months old, and I have a lot of time where I'm babysitting my kid, and I'm bored out of my mind. 
[00:20:30]  So I've been spending a lot more time on Twitter than probably I should.  And I came up with something I like to call sniping.  Probably the proper phrase would be sniper ring.  But when there's a big news story, I go on the trending topics, and I just see what these dummies are writing about.  And in this case, it was Liz Taylor.  And they just tweet the stupidest, dumbest things.  So I pick out a few of those, and then I snipe them.  So for no reason, you just attack them because they shouldn't be talking about this. 
[00:21:00]  No, I attack them because they're just stupid human beings that aren't attached to anything.  They want to be part of something, and simply they're not.  So I have a lot of fun with that.  Also, if you're talking about my Twitter, really quickly, this morning I got some turkey chili.  And I noticed my turkey chili had what could only be described as dental floss or a tampon string in the chili.  And I tweeted a picture of that as well if we're going to be doing some self-promotion today. 
[00:21:30]  That should be a lawsuit.  One more thing.  Is it babysitting when it's your kid?  Can I tear down a wall?  Yes, you can.  I said that once on the air, and it drove people nuts.  And they had to tell me it's not babysitting if it's your own kid.  So guess what I do?  Now that's your thing every single time.  That's what I do with that.  Enjoy.  That was Opie talking about attacking people on Twitter for no apparent reason, just because.  Because why not? 
[00:22:00]  Ron Bennington just walked into the studio.  Ron, today on the show, we had Nick DiPaolo in, and they ended up talking about comedians on Def Comedy Jam.  Like, what was it?  Hamburger Jones.  Have you ever heard of Hamburger Jones?  It just says hamburger.  H-J?  After H-J.  I'm not all that familiar with him.  Yeah, and Shucky Ducky.  Do you know Shucky Ducky?  No, I don't know the Shuckster.  He says quack quack after his jokes.  And he does whatever he ends, he'll just yell out quack quack.  Yeah, yeah.  And that led to Voss' first set on Def Comedy Jam. 
[00:22:30]  Now the thing about Voss is that he's the type of comedian where wherever he is, it doesn't matter what the audience is, he can perform.  Right.  And he can do well.  At the same level, no matter what's happening.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Like, he's always there at a constant eight and a half or so.  Okay.  He used to, when we were doing the walkover, when we were in the K-Rock days, he used to, you probably, most of you remember this because it was one of the greatest things we ever did, especially on the walkover.  The Starbucks comedy tour. 
[00:23:00]  People were crazy about it.  Yeah, where Voss would enter into a Starbucks or a breakfast establishment.  Yeah.  And interrupt a breakfast for a comedy set.  This was Voss at Rue 57 during the Starbucks comedy tour in the K-Rock days right here.  I think this is from what, E-Rock, 2006?  September of 2006.  That was a long time ago.  So, here it is on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:23:30]  Let's do some retro.  Retro with Rich Voss today at Rue 57.  You know, because, I mean, if you come to college, it's all new material.  But, you know, at Rue 57, it's a tough crowd.  Ladies, come see a free show.  I was talking to you.  They couldn't be bothered with you.  Oh.  Look at this.  Security watching security.  All right.  Who's going to introduce me, though?  I need an intro.  I think, um, Keith.  What, they got the AC?  Are they even?  Oh, there's people eating. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  I got to do it over here on this side.  Oh, good.  They're facing me.  Yeah, but, uh, I think we got to walk in the front door.  See if that door is open.  Do you want to introduce me?  Just walk in and go, ladies and gentlemen.  Your first act tonight, today.  All right.  Bonnie will intro.  What did he say, don't do it?  Oh, we'll do it over here.  All right.  Bonnie will intro Rich Voss at Rue 57.  Oh, my God.  This is so embarrassing.  Oh, wait.  Here, Bonnie.  Grab Rich's mic, and then you can hand it to him.  You've got to be nice and loud. 
[00:24:30]  Wait, wait.  Let our audience go in there, first of all.  This is so embarrassing.  Whoever wants to check out the quick three-minute comedy set from Rich Voss.  I can't watch.  It's one of those things so embarrassing, you can't watch it.  We get paid to do this, Dave.  Hey, it's a living, right?  Oh, this is horrible.  The manager just told me to keep it clean.  Oh, he just.  Keep it clean.  All right.  The manager, who's a real.  I don't see it when they do that.  Well, the manager's a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show, and he told Rich just to keep it clean.  That's all right. 
[00:25:00]  Bonnie, you ready?  Bonnie, tell Bonnie to introduce you.  I think everyone that's going in is in there.  Rich thinks he's hanging out backstage before he's going on.  Going out?  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, your first comedian this morning from Last Comic Standing.  Please welcome Richard Voss.  Yay!  Wow.  Hey, how we doing?  Hey, Voss.  It's good to see you guys.  We're going to do a little show because my career is not going.  This is how pathetic my life is.  I owe my 8-year-old $6 for Girl Scout cookies, and I'm dodging her. 
[00:25:30]  She calls me and tries to disguise her voice, but I know it's her.  So go, hello?  Is Daddy home?  Not bad.  Sir, I'm doing a show you can watch.  Give me a few minutes, all right?  What's your name?  Newman.  Are you two married?  How long?  Unfortunately, I got a car, and I'm not like the black guys.  Well, anyhow, don't get upset, all right?  Turn on BET Comic View and watch black comics, tricks, white people for an hour, all right? 
[00:26:00]  White people, crazy.  They pay taxes.  You know what I'm saying?  Loosen up.  We had the girl turn her back on me.  What country are you guys from?  Where are you guys from?  Oklahoma?  There's a nice little Oklahoma pub you might want to go to on 168th and Amsterdam.  It's called Run Whitey Run.  I'm killing it.  They're loving me.  This is the best crowd I've worked in a while.  How you doing, sir?  Do you work here?  What's your name? 
[00:26:30]  What's that?  Maurice, what was Lincoln like as a president?  How old are you?  I'd love to see you having sex.  Did I have an orgasm or break my hip?  Look at this waitstaff.  It looks like the United Nations is meeting here.  How you guys doing?  Wait, what country are you from?  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Do you know a guy named Frank?  I love Bangladesh.  Whenever I played Risk, that was the first country I'd take.  Right into Bangladesh. 
[00:27:00]  You live here now?  It's great.  You don't have to walk down to the river to do your laundry?  Nothing on that one.  Come on.  They're from Bangladesh.  Look at dirt crack.  This is the best set I've had in a while.  Anyhow, folks, I got it wrong.  We just wanted to do a few minutes.  If you're in town tonight, come to Caroline, see the show.  Sir, you can get in free.  And we're giving out stool softeners.  Okay?  You guys were the best eight people I've ever worked to.  Thank you. 
[00:27:30]  I can't believe he killed.  Come on.  I'm pissed.  That pisses me off that he did so well.  He called it Bangladesh.  You bastard.  Where's Bangladesh?  Bangladesh.  I hate that he did well.  Eight people.  And you had them.  And they were all turned around watching you.  Oh, you had them all.  Oh, God.  Oh, is that disturbing me that you actually killed in a restaurant?  Now we got to get disturbed to do a set in there. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, that'll wake him up.  Oh, yeah, the La Capella thing.  I'm going to go tell the manager to come down to Caroline's.  Hold on.  All right.  Thanks, Rich.  That was great.  Oh, Jesus.  That was all right.  Yeah, he did.  I've seen him do worse than that at real comedy clubs.  Right, right.  Bangladesh.  Yeah, Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Only Rich.  I'd love to look at a map if Rich wrote it.  After O&A.  Live.  It's After O&A and Anthony live.  And is that the mark of a true professional when he could take his craft, Rich Voss, and 
[00:28:30]  bring it to any venue, including Route 57, a Starbucks, anywhere?  I mean, Ron, you were just commenting that it sounded like he was doing a set at 9 o'clock  at night.  It was a good set.  He had the same exact energy.  You know, there's a new film out called Source Code that's coming out.  Same guy who directed Moon, wrote Moon.  I love Moon.  And the comedian, Russell Peters, gets up and does the same thing in a train.  Someone gives him money, that's coming to bet, and he just gets up and does it. 
[00:29:00]  And I feel like that should have been Voss's gig.  Yeah, and I mean, it's obvious to me that the writers have ripped this off again.  It happens.  You know?  And he played a character, Russell.  That is true.  Yeah, his name was Russell, who was a comedian from Chicago.  Why couldn't it have been Rich, a comedian from New York?  Jersey.  Yeah, Jersey.  Hoboken.  No joke in Hoboken.  No, yeah.  There's no...  You can't just move to New York.  You're from Hoboken.  So you saw the movie?  I did see the movie.  And was this the same bit?  Uh, no, but it was a thing of, hey, you're a comedian, get up, I'll give you a hundred 
[00:29:30]  bucks, and he jumps up and starts doing the people in the train or enjoying themselves.  If Voss, I mean, if Voss lands up...  Voss would have been perfect.  Yeah, but he's going to get pissed off when he sees the movie because he's going to realize  that people get paid to do this.  We never gave him a hundred bucks to do this.  That is true.  We just said, well, here's the mic.  I don't know whether you know this or not, but you may not have invented the idea of a comedian  just suddenly talking to an audience.  I don't believe...  I don't believe...  Yeah, yeah.  That is our routine.  I mean, Roland was telling us that we have a big week for guests next week. 
[00:30:00]  Who do you got coming in, Roland?  I mean, next week is a pretty loaded week, is it not?  Next week is, um, uh, Danny McBride?  I saw...  Gigantic.  Uh, Your Highness last night.  You did?  Did you like it?  I thought it was hilarious.  I was...  I had low expectations.  Yeah.  I was blown away, though.  Did you smoke a little weed first?  Of course.  You know me.  All right.  Danny McBride's gigantic.  Um, uh, who else?  Well, I mean, that's already loaded up.  Why don't you get back in the second day? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  If you have two days of Danny McBride, it'd be great.  No, he's coming...  He's hanging for the full hour.  Great.  Um, uh, Colin Quinn with Norm MacDonald.  Terrific.  Boom.  And they just...  Norm MacDonald is hot right now because of his tweets.  I said boom.  Yeah.  I've said boom before.  No, I know, but, uh, yesterday on the show, uh, we had...  You're a big Shark Tank fan, right?  Huge.  Uh, uh, Mark was in, and, uh, what's his last name?  The owner of the...  Cuba.  What is it?  Which one?  Mark Cuban?  Yeah, Mark Cuban, yeah. 
[00:31:00]  And he says boom all the time.  He could almost go out with a deaf comedy gym.  Yeah.  Like, he'd just be like talking to you.  Boom.  There it is.  I love when people have a nice catchphrase.  Yeah.  It just accentuates.  Mine's gonna be a hamburger.  That's what I want mine to be.  Yeah.  I did enjoy, uh, You Gotta Choose One yesterday on the Ron and Fez show.  No, you're saying that, but I also see you laughing.  Well, I thought it was funny.  It was a funny bit.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't understand.  Isn't it a comedy show?  It is.  Well, sometimes it is, yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's not my thing.  Fez had the stick.  He did a good job is what I'm saying. 
[00:31:30]  I enjoyed it.  Roland, did he say that off the air or was he busting Fez's balls and now he goes on the air?  This is like a special delivery thing.  I know you've put up with it from Dave.  I've put up with it from Sam.  You and I, we kick.  I've put up with it from Sam, too.  Oh, you've put up with Sam, too.  You were going into your guests before Sam started to run down Fez a little bit.  I was complimenting.  Well, yeah, there's a couple other ones waiting to lock in that looks like they will.  And then, um, Howie Mandel stopping by.  And, um, these are gigantic guests.  These are terrific.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Howie Mandel, Danny McBride, Norm MacDonald.  It sounds like the Tonight Show around here.  Yeah.  Somebody else.  A couple other people that are going to come by.  You just have to.  Danny McBride, to me, you can't get any better right now.  I mean, that show is unbelievable.  He's coming back next year with season three.  Season three.  Yeah, but it's not coming out until, like, 2012, right?  So I've got to wait.  Because he's doing a lot of movies.  I can't even let myself start thinking.  He wrote this movie, Your Highness, too.  He's him and another guy.  He's a mate. 
[00:32:30]  He's a multi-talented guy.  I wish I went to go see it last night, but I'm going to see Super 8.  Super?  You saw Super 8?  J.J. Abrams.  You saw the whole movie?  45 minutes.  Oh.  Why are we 45?  Because that's all he has done so far.  45 minutes of.  That's all he finished so far?  It's awesome.  Is it good?  Well, wait till you're done.  Wait till you're done.  He's just anxious.  No, it was a tease, and then they showed you a preview from MI4, all the Paramount new  movies.  They all look awesome.  Where did you see the set?  Where are you rolling?  Walter Lee Theater, and then afterwards was Reception. 
[00:33:00]  Reception?  And he was there?  He was there.  We chatted.  Did you put in a good word for ONA?  I mean, did you put in a good word for after ONA?  Maybe we could book him here.  He will be coming in.  For after ONA?  It'll be great.  Book him towards the end, so I get a couple minutes, then Ron can come in, and we can have  him.  Yeah, he will be coming in June.  What's the shit with Lost?  What the fuck was that end about?  Some person there asked him, and he just stared at them and go, okay.  It's done.  Well, no, because someone told me what he said about Lost, and they ushered him away pretty 
[00:33:30]  quickly.  I would assume so.  Ron, what can we expect on the big Ron and Fez show today?  Well, we're doing a Live Unmasked.  Really?  A Live Unmasked with Lisa Lampanelli.  Oh, that's good.  She's the queen of me.  She is, right?  She is the queen of me, and there's a...  She made Zach Levi so uncomfortable on the tonight's show.  Is that right?  And if you've seen the tonight's show, he's sitting on the couch next to her, and she's  like, I wish I was doing something else.  She was hilarious on the Donald Trump roast.  The roast thing comes very, very easy to her now, it seems like. 
[00:34:00]  It's like she is...  She's the closer, in my opinion.  That's why she's the queen.  Yeah, she is the queen.  Well, Lisa Lampanelli, a Live Unmasked, which doesn't happen too often.  No, I think this is only the second time in recorded history, and I didn't even want  to do that.  But Rob Cross said, look, I got you the wrong banners.  Why can't you at least do me this?  We've been using a white backdrop for Unmasked.  He gets five new ones, and they're all blue.  And we're like, well, this is completely different.  He goes, when did you guys start to care? 
[00:34:30]  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  Just, what, that we want some kind of consistency?  Yeah.  What, do you care about your show?  And then he literally did this.  Well, Fez didn't say anything.  Oh, he's throwing Fez under the bus.  Yeah, he threw Fez under the bus.  Ouch.  When he wears a hoodie, he has attitude.  Yes.  That's true.  When it's all zipped up, don't fuck with Rob Cross.  I can't, oh, go ahead.  I thought he was just following Opie around.  Remember when Opie had the hoodie?  The hoodies.  Yeah, maybe Rob just joined in the hoodies.  Did that fade away, or are we still doing that?  I mean, on a small level, it's more of an unsaid thing now. 
[00:35:00]  My favorite was when Big A did it.  Yeah.  Well, Big A's down to ride for whatever.  Yeah, he is.  He is.  So, all coming up on the Ron and Fez, a live unmasked, and Fez's response to Rob Cross's comments.  Oh, good.  This is going to be huge.  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez is next.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.
