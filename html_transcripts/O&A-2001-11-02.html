<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with exuberant commentary on the New York Yankees' improbable World Series wins against the Arizona Diamondbacks.  Opie and Anthony reacted with disbelief and excitement, punctuated by a frustrated interruption when a sound effect prematurely ended their "They Call My Name's Bill" segment.  Frequent caller Joey Baseball shared his World Series experience, while other callers attributed the Yankees' victories to a "Sports Curse," mob involvement, or other conspiracies.  Former Mets player Rick Cerrone called in, offering commentary and playfully teasing Opie. The segment was rife with crude humor, referencing sex acts and recalling a previous stunt where people stripped naked for World Series tickets.  A caller hilariously described navigating the Bronx, and the hosts discussed J-Lo's post-9/11 return to New York and impersonated Ozzy Osbourne.  Jim Norton and other comedians were mentioned in relation to a film project, and Diamondbacks pitcher Kim was heavily criticized.  The segment concluded with continued, enthusiastic discussion of the Yankees' victories.


The show then transitioned to a discussion of the Yankees-Mets rivalry and the inconsistencies of airport security. A Dallas caller voiced his Yankee hatred, followed by a Boston caller threatening Opie. The conversation shifted to post-9/11 Lower Manhattan, with in-studio guest Joey Paisano, a Little Italy restaurant owner, complaining about the negative impact of "Avoid Lower Manhattan" signs on his business.  A caller, Tony, described a brawl between firefighters and police officers at Ground Zero due to reduced firefighter access.  Another caller, Bill, a firefighter, disputed the notion of long-standing conflict between the NYPD and FDNY.  Giuliani's comments and Hillary Clinton's Yankee game attendance were mentioned.  This was followed by a discussion of a poorly executed, drunkenly-agreed-upon radio commercial for *Dark Angel*, which was then played, featuring crude commentary about Jessica Alba.

Jeffrey Ross joined the studio, discussing his recent Hugh Hefner roast.  A call from filmmaker Otto resulted in an invitation for Opie and Anthony to cameo in his movie.  The hosts then discussed racy videos from a Hugh Hefner Halloween party.  The segment concluded with the shocking reveal and discussion of compromising photos, allegedly of a drunk Fox News employee, found on Opie's camera, which had been left at his desk.  The photos, showing the woman in various states of undress, implicated an intern named Stinky, and the hosts planned to post them online.


The final segment featured in-studio guests Jeffrey Ross and Paul Mercurio.  Discussions included Bill Clinton's post-presidency activities, notably an anecdote about an unexpected wedding appearance and a kiss with the bride.  A "Boob-a-lantern" contest with a $1000 prize was a major focus, along with the presence of strippers Gina Lynn and Ivy from the Privilege club, who engaged in explicit on-air behavior, including nudity and sexual acts.  A picture of a woman with writing on her thighs was prominently displayed and discussed.  Mercurio's contributions led to a segment being cut due to inappropriate language.  The Boob-a-lantern contest winners were announced, with the hosts repeatedly referencing and displaying images from the contest and the aforementioned picture on foundrymusic.com.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh, wow, there's one from the ONA Archives.  I had it today.  Yes, please.  I love that one.  Yeah.  Well, it's Friday.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  Quick break and the abuse will begin, okay?  How you doing?  I wonder what people want to talk about today.  We'll find out right after this.  Okay.  You guys are Dodge and Anthony.  Wait two minutes. 
[00:00:30]  We'll say something really dumb.  Let's bring in the incest couch.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  We started the show with a little bit we like to call, They Call My Name's Bill. 
[00:01:00]  It's from the ONA Archives.  It's a classic.  Yeah.  There's a whole series of They Call My Name's Bill clips.  Yeah.  That we play from time to time on our show.  And Douchebag down the hall decided to dump out at the end of the bit, which makes playing  the bit completely useless.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The woman asks, what is Bill doing?  And Bill replies, you know, that M word for... 
[00:01:30]  Taking care of yourself.  Cranking.  For cranking it.  Craig, you can't give us one freaking break.  No one's going to go run and tell the government that we get the M word on one time.  And it's not even illegal to put that word on.  It's not.  I don't understand what it is.  If you're getting into graphic detail of that and then you feel a little nervous, fine.  Whatever.  When it's just the word being put out there in a bit like that, that if you ever transcribed 
[00:02:00]  it and read it, no one would shake a head at it or anything.  Craig, you effing killed us today.  Come on, man.  What is that about?  That's called the punchline of a joke.  Without that, the bit isn't as funny.  It's a five-minute setup.  It all comes together with that one line and you decided, oh my God, I got to dump out.  And screw the whole beginning of the radio show.  You know how they'd laugh off a complaint that had that word in it? 
[00:02:30]  The only reason we're not saying it is because he'll dump out of it again.  Effing help us out, man.  We're carrying this whole goddamn place on our backs.  Need a little help every once in a while.  A little assist.  God, that sucks.  I'll call Ken personally and make sure everything's okay.  You won't get fired, all right?  Jesus.  I don't get it.  I don't know why that was dumped out of it.  There's no reason to play the bit.  There's no sense.  So then people all over the country are going, well, why do they start with that? 
[00:03:00]  What is that?  It's not really funny.  The bit just ended with those guys laughing saying, oh, I love that bit.  Well, what's that?  No, I love the punchline.  The punchline.  Come on.  What are you doing to us?  I hear other people saying, oh.  The punchline is the old broad says, what are you doing?  And he says, I'm...  I'm...  Which means taking care of himself.  I'm...  And that's when she gets freaked out and then, you know, hangs up.  And then everyone has a good laugh.  A-O-A-E. 
[00:03:30]  I'm...  A-O-A-E.  My...  A-O-A-E.  Dump it out of that?  This one is...  Oh, grab it.  Grab it.  You get it?  There you go.  I hope you dumped out of that one.  Grab it.  Grab it.  Grab it.  I hope you dumped out of that one.  I don't understand. 
[00:04:00]  Ah.  Oh, yes.  Hey, J. Baseball.  Hey, Joey Baseball.  I'm doing so much better.  So much better.  He just got a phone call from me, Julian.  Yeah.  He wants us to do a little something special, but he ain't.  Oh, yeah.  This is going to go out to all the heroes in New York.  Yeah.  Ah, ah.  How you doing?  I don't even have the...  How you doing?  I don't even have the energy.  How you doing?  I don't even have the energy to fight that.  It's Forrest Curse.  How you doing?  Ha, ha, you doing? 
[00:04:30]  Dink, dink.  How you doing?  Ha, ha, you doing?  Hey, Joey Baseball.  Opie calls up today and says the D-backs are going all the way.  How you doing?  Once again in New York City.  Still the greatest...  Hey, Kama Nooch.  He grew up in New Shilling.  How you doing?  Ah, ah.  There's no doubt in my mind that the mob is definitely involved.  The mob is involved at this point, just like Brewers said yesterday.  Come on. 
[00:05:00]  The mob is involved.  How you doing?  Two nights in a row.  Hey, how about that D-backs coaching?  Isn't that great?  What about that Miserable?  Korean they put in night after night to blow the game.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Still speaking into the stadium.  How you doing?  Yeah.  Sports coach.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Opie.  How you doing?  Make it stop! 
[00:05:30]  Very dishonorable.  How you doing?  Make it stop!  Hey, did you see Kim sit down like he was taking a crap in a rice paddy when that ball flew over his head?  How you doing?  New York and the Yankees don't hand in hand.  I hope that guy commits Harry Caray before, uh...  Yeah!  Is it called Harry Caray, Anthony?  Uh, Harry Caray.  I know.  Yeah, but I think only the Japanese do that.  I don't think the Koreans do that.  Ah, it's Korean? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Hey!  Joey Baseball!  Swing it a high drive.  Deep to left field.  Way back is Bautista.  Three hits!  Going back in!  Scott Bautista!  Goodbye!  The Yankees have tied it up again!  Another miracle! 
[00:06:30]  Bautista and Bautista.  Look at that beer company on the ball.  Yeah!  Who did that?  Joe Balls!  Joe Balls!  Joe Balls!  Yeah!  I mean, they don't even say it's bad.  How you doing?  Ah!  And you go, jokes aside, you keep your...  Yeah!  Yeah!  Don't forget, we all got a big fight to win.  God bless America!  How you doing?  How you doing?  Two-one.  Well, a line drive to right field.  That's a base hit.  Charging is Sanders.  Carling third is Nava. 
[00:07:00]  Here's the throw.  Here's the play of the plate.  He flies!  He's in there!  The Yankees win!  They get it again!  The Yankees win!  And Nava Lock is marked at home plate.  Oh, my God!  Yes!  A mental miracle in the Bronx!  A unbelievable drunk's tale!  Do you believe it's fairy tale?  Oh, my God!  They've had two in a row in a row.  They just do three to two.  And they lead the World Series three to two.  Oh, there's medals in the Bronx.  This stadium is up for grabs.  The sports curse is here to stay. 
[00:07:30]  Two men!  Two dreams!  They put that stupid dink to pitch against New York, New York!  Oh, my God.  Is it true?  I'm going to have an aneurysm.  I feel like Dr. Bellows.  Is it true that the...  I feel like...  Pull me out, Anthony, because I can't do this voice.  I was doing a lot of voices yesterday.  I feel like Dr. Bellows.  But a minute ago, they were leading. 
[00:08:00]  And then I looked in.  And then I saw the...  And then Major Nelson, they were two games.  But then...  And then we put in the...  What happened?  That's how I felt last night.  You know what, though?  I got to tell you.  Yeah.  There was no doubt in my mind that they were going to win.  That they were going to tie the game in the ninth inning.  There was no doubt.  Like I was saying in the back office, Brocious?  Yeah.  In the ninth inning there?  He was just sizing up that prick.  Absolutely.  That Kim, who I learned his... 
[00:08:30]  Do you want to breathe into a bag?  Hit the...  Wow.  Hold on.  Holy cow.  You all right?  I swear to God, I was hyperventilating there.  There you go.  I'm getting lightheaded.  This guy, he pitches, and his pitches don't drop, okay?  Mm-hmm.  So Brocious is there going, okay.  All right.  Oh, my God.  My pass.  Here it comes.  You've never passed out on the radio before. 
[00:09:00]  Do it now.  I just hyperventilated.  Holy ass.  No joke.  All right.  Hold on.  Woo!  Woo!  All right.  Yeah, he was just sizing them up in the ninth inning.  Kim's pitches, they don't drop.  No.  He doesn't have any pitches that sink.  So Brocious...  They either stay even, or they go up a little bit.  So there's Brocious just taking a couple pitches going, all right, I'm just sizing him up.  I got this.  And then I'm sitting there at home going, oh, my God.  I swear I said this to myself.  He's going to hit it out of the park. 
[00:09:30]  I just knew.  I just knew.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Arizona.  They're at the point of the other.  They can't even watch all the episodes of MASH.  This Kim clown could be worse than Benitez in a pressure situation.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I thought Benitez was a waste of space.  Hey, Joey Baseball's up.  He's hyperventilating.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Yankees.  Dudes, I was 10 seconds from passing out. 
[00:10:00]  I swear to God, the whole room started going dark.  Wow.  That would have rocked.  I swear to God.  The curse.  Craig got me all fired up down the hall.  And then I got to deal with the Yankee crap.  I hear...  Dude, the mob?  Brewer said it yesterday.  The mob is definitely...  It has something to do with this, you think?  Without a doubt.  It's never been done before, what they have done the last two days?  Well, coming back in the ninth, after being down, it's never happened before.  It happened to two teams, I believe. 
[00:10:30]  In the 20s, was it?  20s.  In the 20s.  But back to back like that, it's never happened.  The 20s, they were still running too fast.  Right.  The fast motion, black and white film of the fat guy running around the bases.  Yeah, that doesn't count, because for some reason they ran a lot faster back then.  Ah, here he is, my Yankee fan, Paisano over here.  Joey Paisano.  Joey Paisano.  How you doing?  How you doing, Joey?  Eh, eh.  How you doing?  Blah, blah.  Paisano, Mulberry Street. 
[00:11:00]  Eh, eh.  Great Italian food.  Eh, eh.  Ask for Joey, get a glass of wine in the house.  Eh, eh.  How you doing?  Joey DVD.  What did you think, Matt?  What did you just cut them off?  What did you...  Joey.  Joey, I hope you guys...  I was trying to let this cat out of the bag.  What's going on?  I hope you have the inside scoop, because it's mob-related at this point.  There's no doubt in my mind.  First of all, why is Kim even in the major leagues?  He doesn't look like a major league pitcher.  Let me explain something to you that you've got to agree with.  Why, in God's name, after what happened two nights ago, are you then going to allow him 
[00:11:30]  to pitch again last night?  It's the World Series.  It's not, you know, the beginning of the season where maybe you want to try out a guy.  He F's up one night.  You bring him back.  See how he does.  You could do that during the season.  In the World Series, there was no reason to put that guy back in.  The Mets did the same damn thing last year with Benitez.  Right?  Oh, my God.  Kim, let me tell you. 
[00:12:00]  He blew the World Series for the shopping bags.  You still have to get through, Randy Johnson.  I am in a car silly.  Look, look.  Renly's, you know, he's planning on going seven.  He's been planning on going seven since game one.  So maybe something will work out in his favor.  Oh, God.  Nothing's going to work.  Oh, he's all pissed.  He's kicking stuff again.  Why don't you call your buddy, Schilling?  With Kim, with that Luis Teon motion of his. 
[00:12:30]  Did you see him just, like, sit down, grab his knees?  Oh, yeah.  Like he was in a rice paddy somewhere, taking a dump.  And his teammates are trying to talk to him.  His catcher's kind of yelling at him.  Like, you know, trying to calm him down.  But you can see his face is just like.  One guy grabbed his head.  Another guy grabs his shoulder.  Like, he was ready to come apart.  He was crying.  He is only 22.  Right.  He was crying because he was.  He bet on the game.  He bet on the Yankees. 
[00:13:00]  And he was so happy that he got to pitch and give up another home run.  Oh, Rook, what happened?  They say they don't break my legs.  It really was amazing to watch.  But that's why it's the Yankees.  It's not mob related.  It's a team that on paper sometimes.  Shut up.  No, I got to say.  I can't sit here and listen to you cocky Yankee fan today.  You can look and say this team is a little better.  The pitching's better.  This, that.  You could tear it apart all you want on paper.  But when it comes down to it, you can never count the Yankees out. 
[00:13:30]  That's.  Did you hear that call, too?  Do you believe in fairy tales?  Fairy tales?  Because I got a fairy in my tale right now.  Oh, wait a minute.  What?  I didn't mean that.  Trying to one up the Al Michaels call.  Do you believe in miracles?  Right.  That works much better than do you believe in fairy tales?  The New Yorkers.  New York.  Stupid Mets fan.  New York needs a little boost.  Because we had a couple of buildings fall down. 
[00:14:00]  And, you know, a lot of people die.  So New York needs this.  So it's mob-related.  I wouldn't be surprised if the FBI is involved as well.  Now it's an X-Files scale conspiracy that's going on.  Poor, poor Mitch.  Did you ever see that episode of the X-Files where the smoker man said,  and Buffalo will never win a Super Bowl?  Yeah.  Like, they had that small room of people that decided everything that happened in the world. 
[00:14:30]  Everything.  And something happened where he was like,  I said, no, Buffalo is never going to win a Super Bowl.  You're thinking that that kind of group of people are figuring out who's going to win the World Series?  Hey, Rick Serone.  Hey.  In your illustrious career, did you ever play for the New York Mets?  Yes, I did.  1991.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Worst year of his life.  Then I can talk to you.  Worst year of his life.  Okay.  One year.  What was that, Joey?  What?  What did Joey say?  Worst year of his life.  Was it the worst year you had in the majors? 
[00:15:00]  No, that was a good year.  The Mets were fun.  The Mets were fun.  Yeah.  The Mets were fun.  For a goof.  It didn't win much.  It was a goof.  You know, for a goof.  I figured I'd play with them.  For a goof.  The Yanks are our champions, and the Mets are fun.  They're fun.  They're having a good time.  You get your rings with the Yankees, and you have fun with the Mets is what it's all about.  Some laughs.  How are you guys doing?  Very well. 
[00:15:30]  Some better than others today, Mr. Serone.  We missed you guys this year.  I don't know what happened.  We were all planning for that big celebrity softball game.  Yes.  It never happened.  We've got to do it next year.  That's all.  We'll do it next year.  We will.  We definitely will.  You guys doing okay?  Are you having a good time?  Having so much fun, and it's so great to watch a team like the Yankees come back from behind  so many times.  I was okay until the ninth inning last night, Mr. Serone.  Oh, you were?  I was doing quite well, as a matter of fact.  So you're dead against the Yankees. 
[00:16:00]  I'm a diehard Mets fan.  There are two types of Mets fans.  They go all the way, and they never root for the Yankees, and then there's a bunch of  pussy Mets fans.  Well, my team's out of it, so I'm going to root for the Yankees.  And he used to...  Because New York might as well win.  He used to do some boating with Brother Wheeze and Curt Schilling.  Now, even this year...  He's like his pal.  Even this year, with everything that went on September 11th, you just don't have it in  your heart to root for New York to win.  Oh.  I want to put a guilt trip on you. 
[00:16:30]  Look at you.  Hi, you guys.  Look at you, Mr. Sorrell.  That's a Yankees.  Look at you, Rick.  How are you doing?  I just figure that, you know, the fact that we're playing the World Series is good enough  for me, and it's good for the United States of America if the Diamondbacks win the World  Series.  Oh.  Now, I know...  So, in other words, that you're, like, on the edge of your seat last night.  You're saying, well, Tino Martinez is one thing.  No, no, no.  If it's not Brocious, there's no way in the world he's going to hit a two-out home run.  Rick, you just missed the first ten minutes of the show. 
[00:17:00]  I swear to you, when Brocious got up, I knew, in my heart, he was hitting a home run.  I just knew it.  He was sizing up that pitcher.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Here it comes.  I swear to you.  Swear.  Do you think this is the last time we'll ever see Kim, the pitcher?  Yeah.  Hopefully, he's killing himself right now.  Oh, my God.  You know, they were talking about that.  That could very well be a career-ending chain of events that happened to this guy.  Two words, Donnie Moore.  Donnie Moore.  No, actually, you can talk about one that's even closer. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, Mitch Williams.  You know, I had a couple of guys.  How about Mark Wohlers?  Who was he?  Oh, exactly.  Remember, Mark gave up the home run, the grand slam to Jim Lerich in the 96 World Series.  Oh, okay, right, right.  He's actually on the Yankees roster right now, but he's never really been the same pitcher.  Well, at least he's still alive.  He's still alive, yes.  But Donnie Moore killed himself, right?  Donnie Moore never forgave himself for the home run that he gave up to Andrew.  Oh, man, that is so sad.  Also, don't forget about Mitch Williams of the Phillies. 
[00:18:00]  Mitch Williams, yeah, but he's a pitching coach in our league.  Yeah, they're still alive.  That's why I said Donnie Moore.  That's the best example.  But that killed himself.  But after that, he never came back.  I know.  Mitch Williams was pitching coach for the Atlantic City Surf this year, and he actually activated himself.  I think he was 42 years old.  He pitched a game against us in Newark.  Mitch, you guys could even suit up.  Opie, I know you want to try to get in there one day.  You know, that's the one thing.  I own the team.  I'll let you do anything you want.  You want to coach first base? 
[00:18:30]  You want to pitch it for us?  Well, I think I'm going to be joining the Islanders at midseason.  Is that what you're doing?  Yeah.  You got planned?  I'm a three-sport guy, but my main focus is hockey, and I should be ready to take the ice with the Islanders by February.  You're ready?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, now you're hockey.  I've always been a hockey fan.  You've mastered baseball and softball.  No, my two biggest sports are hockey and basketball, I've got to tell you.  I still owe you.  Baseball, then football, and then baseball.  I'm not the hugest baseball fan in general. 
[00:19:00]  I still owe you.  Yeah.  You threw a couple pitches close to me that day in Riverfront Stadium.  Yeah, yeah.  The golf ball game that you dogged us.  He was trying to brush back a few of the people.  You know, Anthony, we can't be on the same team again.  Why is that?  Anthony's tough.  He was tough.  He was a tough manager.  You know, he was the manager of that team, and it just fell apart that day.  Look, I can put it to you in very simple terms.  My team, drunk.  Opie's team, sober.  There was a lot of bottles left in our dugout. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Empty bottles.  We had the heavy drinkers.  They had the heavy hitters.  I don't know.  You know, you guys got me in a lot of trouble.  I've got to just tell you, a lot of trouble with all the Internet pictures and the photos.  Oh, jeez.  But I'll tell you what, people had a good time.  I've got to explain, yeah, because we're in a lot of cities now, Rick Cerrone.  We did a bikini softball game at his fine stadium in Newark, New Jersey.  And, yeah, it was a wild time for everybody.  You know what?  It was fun.  You guys, I tell you, you get some audience. 
[00:20:00]  People love you.  You were great with the fans that were there.  I tell you, I enjoyed it, and we're looking forward to doing it again.  All right.  We'll do it in the...  And maybe we'll see each other when the Yankees win the championship.  Oh, yeah.  Going right down the Canyon of Heroes again.  Again.  How you doing?  All right, Rick.  Thank you.  All right.  You guys be good.  Thank you.  Keep in touch.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  He's a great guy.  Rick Cerrone of the Yankees.  Rick Cerrone.  Ex-Yankees.  Well, and the fun Mets.  The fun Mets. 
[00:20:30]  And he had fun with the Mets one year.  For a goof.  Hey, Rick Cerrone, you want to maybe, for a little goof, you just sewed up in a Mets uniform.  Oh, but now it's mine.  We'll have a few laughs.  We'll have a few laughs.  And then I'll change my pants.  Bru-ah.  Man.  Man.  Bru-ah.  All right, hold on.  Bru-ah, Bru-ah.  Man.  You know what? 
[00:21:00]  I could save you.  I could save you a lot of time.  I could just hang up on you and play the tape from yesterday.  It's the same exact thing.  Bru-ah, what were you thinking when they brought Kim back in?  When they brought Kim in last night, what was going through your head?  I said, this dude has some yambics.  But I like it.  Dude.  Bru-ah.  But this is the best.  Yeah.  After he got the second out.  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah.  Even, that's when he started, he got a little cocky.  And he looked at the third baseman and gave it like, I'm under control now. 
[00:21:30]  I got a little, I got a little, I got a little together now.  Oh, he did.  Very little cocky.  He gave that big, goofy smile.  Two out, man.  And you can tell his whole life, because when Mark Grace grabbed him, that wasn't just like  a, because he was like, yo, yo, don't be a faggot, don't be a faggot, don't cry, don't  be a faggot.  Your family's watching.  They're in cook.  Don't be a faggot.  I think they're right.  He grabbed him hard. 
[00:22:00]  He grabbed him hard.  Dude, I think that kid was like deported or something.  And he was like, beating the daylights out of in fourth grade.  And he was a kid, got shoved in the ground, said, we're bad, bitch.  I just picture him, after the first game he pitched, getting back and just going, I'm so  sorry, like studying to learn how to say I'm sorry in English, to everybody, just gathering  up the team and going, I'm so sorry.  I promise I do a better next time you give to me the chance. 
[00:22:30]  I'm so sorry.  So they're probably like, ah, the poor kid.  You know, let's give him another chance.  And now it's just like, oh, total disgrace.  Bro, this guy's worse than Benitez.  You know what?  He's worse than Benitez.  You know why he's worse than Benitez?  Benitez, they just took away the 86 game, six game.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:23:00]  It took two games, but they just put themselves in that level.  Brewer, I'm with you.  This is mob related.  I think the FBI.  What did I tell you?  They went to Cleveland and said, David Justice, come with us.  We got two Cubans on the boat.  Let's go.  They'll be playing in six years.  Let's go.  He's our best player.  Shut up.  Talk to Anthony.  I mean, are you kidding me?  Do you believe in fairy tales? 
[00:23:30]  You know what was funny?  Last night, you know what my reaction was last night?  I swear to God.  Yeah.  I laughed.  Did you?  It was so insane, I just went.  This is nuts.  I'm playing with my donkey.  I'm going to get stoned.  I'm going to play with my donkey and pass out.  Because this is not happening.  I was just watching the TV.  Scott Brochick and I'm like, just do it.  Just hit the homer.  I'm waiting.  Just do it.  Do it.  I'm waiting.  Go.  Go.  And sure enough, boom.  Well, now, Fox Sports, they do that little thing where you get the Fox sounds of the game. 
[00:24:00]  And when I saw the coach come out and say that he was pulling his pitcher and putting Kim in,  I'm like, oh, my God, I can't believe this.  And then they put the little Fox Internet poll up.  Do you think you should put Kim in?  Yeah, exactly.  Get off the mound now.  Get off, Dick.  Get him out, Dick.  Big D-E-E-E.  Real long.  That's so funny, though. 
[00:24:30]  Don't cry, faggot.  Well, that's what he said.  He's like, don't faggot.  All the kids watching, my aunt and uncle, don't be faggot.  What are you going to do?  Squirt a couple out?  What are you going to do?  Cry?  You're going to cry?  Bounce the ball off his head.  Don't cry, faggot.  He was ready to lose it, man.  Yes, he is.  Well, you know there's one guy.  Who do you think is on the Diamondbacks that wants to kill him?  The guy that gets drunk says, I'm shooting that shit. 
[00:25:00]  I'll tell you who.  What am I going to do?  Hurt chilling.  Hurt chilling in a no problem with people traveling.  We do it.  We do it.  We do it.  We do it.  We do it.  We do it.  We do it.  We do it.  He had to sit there that first game and just watch his hard work go down the tubes while  he gave up that game.  How much do you think that hurt, man?  Can you imagine how much that hurt?  Do you know they were sitting on that bench when it was two out, and then Yankees got a  guy on second just going, bro, she's coming up, and you're just like, it can't happen. 
[00:25:30]  You know they're sitting there going, it cannot happen again.  I even tell you, Anthony, I literally started cracking up before it happened going, before  this really is going to, you're screwing my head, this is really going to happen.  Yeah, because you're like, there's no other way this could end.  It has to get over the way.  He's got to smack this thing right out of here.  Someone must have cracked their pants.  Yeah, exactly.  And who's the retard on the Diamondbacks with that, when he bats? 
[00:26:00]  Craig Council.  Oh, Council looks like he's going to fall over backwards.  Oh, yeah.  He gets up in that stance.  He went to the school of Shinjo.  One of the guys on Fox last night goes, basically, I wish I had the quote, but he said something  like, that is the most ridiculous stance in the history of baseball.  How the hell does he hit the ball?  Yeah, he said, how does he expect to hit anything like that?  And then they show his stats.  He was like, he's won for 19 in the series or something.  His name popped up because he's great out in the field, and he had that one home run 
[00:26:30]  in game one.  In game one.  But when you see him stand up.  He had a wonderful rookie league.  He was straight out of high school.  When you see him stand up, and he goes into that stance where he looks like a retard in  the Special Olympics baseball team, it actually, his bystand.  When he did that in Little Leagues, the coach said, George, what are you doing?  Yeah, exactly.  How do you get to the major leagues batting like that without somebody telling you, stop  that?  What are you doing?  Stop that.  He gets his arm so high up that his bicep goes in front of his face. 
[00:27:00]  When Rivera was pitching to him, he actually covered up his right eye with his own bicep.  And Rivera's just like, what is going on?  Who is this?  This guy is crazy.  He's retarded.  I pitch, I get sandwiched.  For some reason, he entertains me.  And then Rivera blew that first pitch by him, and he's standing there like, wow. 
[00:27:30]  I can't hit that.  But it's retarded stance.  He had that look on his face that he did not want to be there.  No.  You know when you knew it was going to happen?  When you just saw, Jeter, you just saw him laughing.  He already read the script.  I don't know what the ending was.  When Jeter came out to bat in the tent, he starts laughing.  He's like, oh.  And they're like, don't make it out.  I'm not.  I swear to God.  The whole time walking from the dugout, he was smiling.  He was smiling. 
[00:28:00]  And then when he came up to bat.  He goes, no.  I think I saw him out.  No, I don't hit it tonight.  It's not me tonight.  It's God.  It's God.  You're being game seven.  Thank you.  Joe was saying on line one, council was the NLCS MVP.  You know nothing.  Open.  Whatever.  Not only that, he was all over the field last night.  But he's having a horrible World Series.  That's what I was saying with his, whatever.  He makes some great plays.  Great plays.  He does.  Held on to that ball, Derek.  What happened? 
[00:28:30]  See?  Jesus, man.  Loses his mind.  Brewer, yes.  Oh.  Yeah.  I can only say this, but I did call a Yankee fan today.  Yeah.  And I say, I'm going to have a difficult time saying this.  Yeah.  But they, dude, the greatest I've ever seen.  It's so annoying.  Well, you've got to give it to me.  I have no support here once again.  A bunch of Yankee fans.  I still have my 86 Mets.  And the only one that's on my side is a Red Sox fan. 
[00:29:00]  Well, go figure.  What good is that going to do me?  Go figure.  Well, Mets fans got to keep an even more pathetic team fan next to them at all times to make them feel better.  And boy, if the Sox ain't it.  Oh, next year we'll have Moises.  Whatever.  Moises.  Well, I think we should let the King of Canarsie go.  Hey, man.  Have a good day. 
[00:29:30]  Who are you, Hammer?  It's the King of Canarsie.  Come on.  It's like Tony Metropolis.  Tony Metropolis.  Tony Metropolis on the phone.  I was laughing my ass off watching that.  You did see it finally?  Hell yeah.  Did we both watch the American Dummy?  Did you like it?  I liked it, man.  You killed it as Tony Metropolis, King of Canarsie.  It was a goof.  We just got together and just said, let's film.  Let's just hang it out.  I don't want to ruin the ending.  It was Norton the whole time.  It's all our buds from the radio show. 
[00:30:00]  They made this movie with Otto and George.  Jim Norton's in it.  Louis Black with puffy, permed hair.  Louis was hilarious in it.  Hey, Brewer, who's that?  Louis was hilarious.  Who's that hack comic that keeps ripping off everyone's material?  He's the middle guy.  Which guy?  Hey, Correale.  Is that who that is?  Right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Correale.  That is so funny and so inside as far as comics go because he's that guy that just, he's a hack,  he sucks, and he just steals everyone's crap and does it right in front of them. 
[00:30:30]  It's great.  He wore the big cross earrings.  Yeah, yeah.  He was hilarious, man.  Brooklyn hack.  He's a funny dude.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen him.  He's really good.  Well, all right.  Brewer, we've got to let you go.  We'll talk to you soon, man.  I've got a headache.  I'm so stressed out.  A lot of people asking about your tour.  Are you in any of our cities?  I'll be Irving Plaza, November 27, 28, something like that. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, we're all going to go to that one.  So, that's on.  I've got a few emails from people wondering if it's on, so.  Yeah, no, that's on and, yeah.  All right.  So, that's the only New York place.  But that's, of course, the end of this month.  Brewer, call us Monday when the Diamondbacks win it all, baby.  All right.  You've done it, Hammer.  All right.  There you go.  Oh, by the way, this just in.  New York City must be safe because Jennifer Lopez has decided to come back to New York.  Thank God, twat.  Hey, can we, uh... 
[00:31:30]  She's on TRL.  She had to stay away from New York.  It was too scary for her.  Well, you know, like they put the vice president in the secure locations whenever we're on high alert.  We must keep J-Lo safe because God knows there would be such panic in the United States if something ever, God forbid, happened to J-Lo.  Ugh.  Dick Cheney's hiding in her butt, I hear.  Is that true?  Is that the secure location?  She was J-Lo's ass.  She was too scared of New York, so she hung out in Miami.  But she's back now, Ann, so everything should be okay and back to normal. 
[00:32:00]  Down in Florida, too.  This is Miami, man.  Well, it's just...  What?  Why not just go upstate, then?  It's upstate New York.  There's anthrax everywhere.  If you're going to be scared, you might as well go somewhere really beautiful.  That's true.  Man, if our president could take the walk from the dugout to throw out the first pitch, how scared were you?  It took four hours for people to get into Yankee Stadium.  But how vulnerable did you feel?  Because, I mean, come on.  I know he was secure and safe, but you see him walk out to the mound, you're like, oh, my God, there's the president of the free world all by himself in the middle of the field. 
[00:32:30]  If he could do that, I think Jennifer Lopez could hang out in New York.  Could you think there's just some drunk fan going, dude, get this, man.  Dude, when Bush walks out on the mound to pitch, dude, I'm jumping and shaking his hand, man.  I want to pat that man on the back and say, good job. 
[00:33:00]  Dude, watch this, watch.  Okay, dude, he's walking out.  Give me a beer.  Give me a beer.  Okay, dude, I'm going.  All right?  One, two, three.  Here I go.  You know there were guys in baseball uniforms with the earpiece and guns under their uniforms. 
[00:33:30]  Dude, what did I do, man?  I love the guy.  I'm going to pass them.  Dude, I'm going to streak.  Dude, I'm going to parachute in.  How much you give me?  Dude, you think I get kicked out?  I shake hands with Bush.  You think I get kicked out?  Of the country.  All right, well, let's take a break. 
[00:34:00]  We haven't even gone to the phones yet for that abuse.  There's some great phone calls on hold.  We'll talk to you guys next.  Why is Ope such a crybaby?  Can we save Rewer's call so we can play it at 6.30 and leave?  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne and I'll see you at the 9th.  I mean, I don't know what year I was in.

[00:44:00]  somebody yeah went to somebody that was a big fan because in order to do that you'd have to really want  to go and i guess there's video of it on foundrymusic.com yeah f-o-u-n-d-r-y music.com yes uh  ben oh okay so what how yeah so the look of uh death this morning by the someone who works in the  building yeah knows who i am so i'm i'm uh coming into the building first of all uh with the security  at this building it is the biggest joke ever uh ever i don't have a building id pass i don't have

[00:48:30]  owner of the building i'm like wow nice power move for a woman you know and then there's that glass  ceiling it's kind of hard for women to own stuff like this go yeah she did a good job she's not the  owner of the building aha that's what i find out she's saying my my building she goes what are we  going to do to keep uh oh she said what are we going to do about the naked women in my building  i don't know what are you offering you know i'm thinking because she's kind of cute man she's kind 
[00:49:00]  of blonde she wears little power skirts and stuff and uh she goes no uh we can't have that what are we  going to do about it i'm thinking of jay's line what are we going to do about this so i go uh you  know i'll uh i'll uh talk to the guys she goes do you promise i go promise what yeah that there'll be  no more nudity in this building i'll go i'll talk to the guy and we all talked about it and there you  go and we love nudity in and around this building we talked yes we talked there you go we talked about 
[00:49:30]  it so she's so uh uh freaked out about the nudity that she kicked us off uh building property we were  on the sidewalk that's like uh that's that's city property i do believe what is the security issue  with uh people removing their clothing for a couple of seconds i feel safer if the people take their  clothes off then you know they're not you know packing any heat not packing rick knew they were packing  one under one peeler and one unpeeled so for a moment there i felt very safe yeah you 
[00:50:00]  could see they didn't have any weapons or anthrax but now they all all the security people have the  secret service earpieces they're all wired with radios and stuff i understand uh we're in a heightened  state of alert and some of these buildings got to be taken care of but um as far as the number down  the list as far as the target goes that this building is ah i don't know by the way i know the word  is rapport so go f yourself douche what oh sorry someone else was supposed to hear that uh dave 
[00:50:30]  what's up hey on a hey i'm listening to the first time caller cool uh i've been listening to you got  for a very very long time and the first time i've heard something you're doing like that and  not only the people around were horrified i was horrified too there was 15 people getting naked  girls you can see that faces over there on 57th street yeah a lot of everybody looked away nobody was  looking there a lot of horrified looks as people were getting naked around them well i think another 
[00:51:00]  point i think the girl deserved more than a dvd player because she was the only girl getting  naked last night you know uh we had a girl that was down there very uh nice breasts on this girl very  nice natural big perfectly placed nippies the whole deal in a little stretchy black shirt that showed just  about everything you can see the position of them and everything very nice no she  she comes in he's kicking things he's still the yankees got him pissed 
[00:51:30]  she's downstairs uh getting uh lifting her shirt up and stuff so we invite her to come up late in the  show she shows her cans once for like a split second we see the beauty of them and everything  and she's gone when do i get yankee tickets i want yankee tickets like we don't have it we gave  him away to the guys that got naked first whatever uh all right uh i i want uh something besides a  bumper sticker like no what do you want so we wheel in all of a sudden a dvd player and a great yankee  warm-up jacket and then i start thinking screw this bitch we've had plenty of girls that come up here 
[00:52:00]  and show their uh cans for just the joy of it and then if we decide we want to give him a t-shirt  some cds that's a perk we're being extorted out of a couple of really good prizes that we don't have  we finally on this show we finally woke up we woke up we got we got a moment of clarity yeah we have  morals now anthony all right uh a couple calls uh yes ben well you know she's been pissed this  this chick that runs a building go back to it i mean she was pissed when we had spaz dressed up as 
[00:52:30]  spider-man and walking around yeah walking around the building i grill she's been mad i mean she went  she went and had to meet with ken over this whole thing she didn't want we had to take all the building  on the website yeah we had to take down all pictures that had the building in the background  remember that hot piece of ass um uh are you kidding me we had to do that ken had to meet with  her the blonde um oh you mean the girl that walked around top yeah what was her name glory  how are you doing look at joey look we had glory and this uh this stripper with a phenomenal body a 
[00:53:00]  blonde with uh she's won all sorts of competitions with having the best natural breasts ever or  something and we've had her walk around the building and uh all the pictures of her walking  around topless that show the building in the background had to be uh taken off our website  the building itself or the 888 sign both no no no it's all just please stop it are you kidding me  where it's all that stuff it's a building it's a friggin building a special i was even able to think 
[00:53:30]  all right maybe if the address is on there or something but just the stone of the building  and the glass and everything that's too much oh they buckle under much too easily let's talk to  uh i mean i mean amen amen amen who would know what's up nothing god opie yeah you gotta tuck in your  string my friend with your crying about the yankees you know you're like the little kid that sucks at  dodgeball that gets eliminated right away i was really good at dodgeball my friend not with your 
[00:54:00]  baseball stick around after you get eliminated not because you have a chance to win hold on what  what city are you from i'm i'm in ball i'm calling from boston right now i just moved up here to go to  school i'm from jersey i gotta tell you though this is this is goes way beyond the yankees in the world  series there is something that is going wrong in my head with with sports you guys don't understand i  have not picked a winner in a really long time it's kind of freaking them out a bit is what it's all  about see we're having fun with it on the radio but the fact remains i no one could uh remember the last 
[00:54:30]  time i picked a winner yeah and we we pick games all the time on this show yeah but it sounds like  you just hate the yankees for the sake of the fact that you're a met fan though yeah calling other met  fans uh i don't know if i you use the word so i guess i can call on met fans pussies that don't  hate the yankees no there are there are two types of met fans i explained this yesterday there are met  fans that are definitely rooting for the yankees in the world series definitely but there are also a  bunch of met fans and probably more that are rooting for the diamondbacks it's just how we 
[00:55:00]  know what i'm moving up to boston i got a lot of flack for being a yankee fan well they hate the  yankees up there that's they at least have a reason to hate us because we keep them out of the  playoffs by being in first place you don't know new york baseball if you don't understand the met  yankee thing bro cursing i mean it's one thing if the yankees are playing the mets like last year  you know you truly don't understand the the new york baseball thing no i understand i guess like if  med fans get really pissed off because uh the yankee fans they have a lot to be cocky about but  they they shove it in your face and they're beyond cocky at this point well it's bitterness 
[00:55:30]  man you got to get over it man tuck in your string a little bit all right you guys please  don't use that expression after some photos we saw today oh thanks we gotta move on get me the  photos we're gonna have to do it after break before we do it i got i gotta read this uh quick from  eaf says in my building madison and 47 they now check our bags when you ask the security  guys what they're looking for they give you a blank stare they're just looking for what they  don't even know when asked one of them once said you know bombs and things do you know what a bomb 
[00:56:00]  looks like is it an alarm clock with a little bell on top wrapped up in sticks of dynamite  are you trained in bomb detection they suck i've since given in and just show them the inside of  my bag why i don't know i know but that's what we're down to yeah like actually i'm thinking more  the big round cannonball looking bomb with the lip fuse out of the top like in the cartoons  it's a tnt i was thinking about the the four or five sticks dynamite wrapped up together yeah and  then the uh curly wire that goes to the plunger box like the coyote use and then what and what the 
[00:56:30]  security guards got to figure out which wire to cut is it the green one the blue one or the red one  why did he coyote super genius and he starts sweating and he's a white security guard but his  buddy's a black security guard together they're going to work this out and then one of them goes  i'm too old for this  and then they go what the hell and they they cut the red one there and it stopped with how many  seconds left oh wow at least one or two right yeah but you know it's such crap with security 
[00:57:00]  because yesterday because the older guy was going to retire next week right  steve roe and i had to go pick up a package over on fifth and we're cutting back through a building on  57th day of security checkpoint we walked into this building a building we didn't work work in  walked completely through it didn't check nothing we walked you know meanwhile they're checking other  people's bags and i gotta tell the people in other cities i hope we're painting a picture you would  you'd probably are sitting there going well you know don't you feel safer no because it's a facade 
[00:57:30]  it's the fake a facade wreck is it would it be considered a facade or that would be considered a  facade it is because you you know most of these people have no clue what they're guarding what  they're looking for you might notice the security guards and uh national guardsmen they are armed  with guns at all the uh places of travel here but as we drive the tram around back you'll see they  are nothing more than cardboard cutouts these are facades or false front i'm your guide mad max all

[01:01:30]  yeah they they block off lower manhattan your your restaurants in lower manhattan  yes now little italy little italy mulberry street paisano mulberry street in the heart  right and uh at first all of lower manhattan was just cut off you weren't going in there unless you  were an emergency vehicle and that was kind of wrong then they opened up the area and people  started coming in they felt like they had to get out get away from uh all this disaster and everything 
[01:02:00]  and uh go out for a night so it picked up a bit now it's kind of slacking back off yes  jesus christ and and and i see the signs that say avoid lower manhattan julianni like please come in  come into manhattan use our businesses see the shows have dinner and uh then there's all these  signs avoid lower manhattan how about just avoid the parts that you can't get into anyway yeah it 
[01:02:30]  seems like the signs that said avoid lower manhattan are stupid you don't want to avoid it you want to  go down there and and do business with the people down there you want to avoid the places where there  are cranes and doing work but you can't get there anyway yes you know you make a great point get there  as you're driving on the highways into the city yeah there's signs everywhere avoid lower manhattan  yeah that's the manhattan is open people yeah exactly you do not have to avoid it that's got  to be no traffic you're so right that's gonna be killing business and and and giuliani yeah you 
[01:03:00]  said it all but then giuliani wants uh people in manhattan spending money to bring the economy back  well it ain't gonna it's not helping uh making it seem like it's a ghost town down there they've opened  up a lot of the roads they've gotten they're all open down there you can get through no problem  they've gotten the uh no problem because it's a ghost town right exactly yes they've gotten the  disaster side pretty condensed now to just a few streets that are closed a few blocks and uh  everything else is open for business so i don't know why they're they're making such a big deal 
[01:03:30]  about um keeping it closed and avoid lower manhattan no go in there spend some money have some fun go  out yeah it's time to take down those uh avoid lower manhattan signs i know you know people  fly back to new york it is now safe yeah they've changed permanent signs in lower manhattan on on  highways you drive down the fdr there are permanent signs now that say emergency vehicles only just like  the big green signs that are on any highway it's not even temporary anymore flashing on the side of  the road or or covering up a sign that you know that's there for the long term and it's gonna kill 
[01:04:00]  business more than it is already if people don't understand that you can go down there and uh eat  drink and be merry so go get a plate of pasta at uh paisanos and mulberry street ask for joey and he  say he'll tell you before the disaster you would have gotten a glass of wine but he's got to cut some  corners support uh paisanos yeah well i'm not going to get my beers at my islander games  got that right uh let's uh let's go to tony tony what's going on joey you make it all up in the 
[01:04:30]  yankee game my best anyway tony how you doing what's how you doing listen guys when you went for your  first break i was switched the channels to 10 10 and giuliani was on live and he was talking about we  have to conduct ourselves in a professional manner i don't know what he's talking about as they went on  they put carrick on it turns out there was a demonstration this morning about uh cutting of 
[01:05:00]  the of how many firemen are down at ground zero so it turns out that it got really violent the  firemen got in a brawl because carrick was like you cannot assault policemen you cannot  throw barricades of police when it turns out some cops got like black eyes they got like neck injuries  and they arrested i don't know about a dozen firemen or so it's like you know something the mayor also  said that uh the city has to get back to normal and cops and firemen fighting god damn it that's back  tomorrow exactly that is back tomorrow man because there's no love lost a lot of the times 
[01:05:30]  between the uh nypd and the fdny i'll tell you that right is that insane wait they're fighting at  ground zero yeah yeah that's fine they got in a brawl because you know that they cut the amount of  due to safety reasons they said they got the guy that's in charge of like the planning down there for  all this uh he doesn't want he doesn't want a bunch of firemen he said underneath a lot of these cranes  so they're pulling a hell of a lot of uh firefighters off of the scene and just letting  the crews go but now the firefighters are saying hey we don't want this to be a a grab up and and uh 
[01:06:00]  dump in the dump truck and haul away kind of operation we want to recover uh bodies for  they want to recover their own and recover their own that's what the firefighters are all about they  have to you know recover their own right so now the police have been told hey these guys are off the  site uh they're supposed to be having a demonstration we'll set up some blocks and don't  let them through well the firefighters came through and said f you we're coming through uh started  throwing barricades there were some scuffles between uh cops and firefighters some of the firefighters  arrested which has got to be you know i don't care it's got to kill a cop to have to arrest a 
[01:06:30]  firefighter when you're all in the same boat here they're just taking orders from brass and it would  be their ass if if they just let the firefighters through so they're doing their job the firefighters are  working off a lot of emotion in in this situation so they're telling them the cops to go f themselves  you know we're doing what we want to do and um we're back to normal man can you imagine if these  guys can you imagine if these guys these cops and these firemen were like a week ago were like  side by side digging and now they're like you know you know how about a month and a half ago side by 
[01:07:00]  side dying yeah exactly exactly i'm surprised people haven't snapped before this i'm just i'm just  wondering if there's any listeners out there anybody that knows what's going on if they can call in or if  any any cops or firemen just call in let us know what's going on how am i supposed to deal with  this when i was at the yankee game in extra innings i gotta sleep i can't be doing this i'm a vampire  people ask me how i'm able to i'm awake all the time and you see me without sleep i catch a couple of 
[01:07:30]  winks in my coffin that's great giuliani rudy giuliani i like to wear women's clothing  f mark green that sucker  oh and he couldn't smell my  i can't think we got a pissed off firefighter bill what's up bill  oh and hey turn down the radio bro radio's off 
[01:08:00]  all right go ahead hey don't start this uh pdfd fight thing it has nothing to do with that  you're way way way i know it doesn't i'm saying it's back to the way it used to be because you  guys have been at odds quite a few times in this city no no no no the paper put us at odds we were  never at odds but a fireman for 14 years pd and fb have gotten along the entire time this has  absolutely nothing to do with that i understand this situation has nothing to do with that that's 
[01:08:30]  what we're just saying it's back to old times it's not back to old times  that was that was a little bit of a joke on new york history my friend yeah well you know what it's  when when cops and firefighters would show up at the same emergency and get into fights over who's  going to deal with it you tell me that you tell me that never happened in new york it happened in  the news it didn't happen in real life okay all right i seem to remember uh quite a few of those  uh false stories then about uh fire department and cops showing up at the same emergency getting 
[01:09:00]  into arguments over who's going to handle it and who's uh in charge at this  let me ask you a question were you there no i wasn't no were you were you were you there at  every one of those situations no i wasn't all right there you go so we both don't know what  we're talking about but i've been no not sure i've been a fireman for 14 years i've never in my  career had a problem with a pd all right i'm not saying all of you did no yes you did because you  said all right all right all right all right phil we're going back to the old ways it's not going back  to the old way all right bill we're gonna go this is a problem with the fire department not being able to 
[01:09:30]  pick up their own guys like right right and that's what we said i did hear you say that but  don't say we're going back our old way bill we're gonna do everyone a favor we're gonna go back to  the goofiness so i'm gonna hang out on you all right all right love you guys people definitely  can't uh take a little bit of pressure there a little sticky situation and did you see uh hillary  clinton at the yankee game last night you know she used to fight with the firefighters and the cops all the  time no i didn't i did not see um hillary at the game exactly yeah oh she's another one that's all 
[01:10:00]  we need to say about that i couldn't make it to the game i was too busy and besides i am not gonna  buy two tickets one for me and one for chuck schumer who is so far up my that i can't sit in one seat  right chuck 
[01:10:30]  he's been in that more than clinton i'll tell you that  oh we got a great clinton story we'll do in a little while hey we got uh we got to play our dark  angel spot bill clinton by the way is just my absolute hero right now i really didn't like him  as president he was very entertaining and and some of his policies i didn't agree with and stuff but  this the civilian bill is so amazing fun yeah i want to party with him not not after today's paper 
[01:11:00]  oh yeah i heard we'll talk about it later well we'll get into it he basically is saying that he  would do a better job than uh president bush yeah that's what the fun part is i could why not screw  go yourself joey  well i think the bj had something to do with why we're at where we are today everyone was uh  too busy worrying about you and your hummers my administration you had you were uh hard-pressed 
[01:11:30]  to find serious issues to get pissed off about who cares imagine today if if if today  the biggest problem was the president getting a job in in the office you go hey fine go ahead do it  i don't care those are fun times fun times you know and then they were just pisser time when you  look at everything that's going on right now and realize the the big mess we made over the well the 
[01:12:00]  big mess he made the big mess that was made over the the uh uh hummer situation you look back now and  go god damn that was nothing man the market was rallying everyone's having fun everyone's working  so what he's getting a little in the oval office you know looking back now but at the time that was like  the big deal that was uh big news yeah if we can only go back to those boy our lives have changed huh  yeah and then he's then he mails salmonella to himself to get back in the news i'm convinced he 
[01:12:30]  mailed his the salmonella to his office in harlem you read that last week yeah yeah yeah he's trying  to get back in the news it's like hey don't forget about me william jefferson clinton i gotta make it  i'll make it i'll make it go off to the side and down just like those crazy people all capitals all  capitals a la rules i gotta spell one word wrong so it looks like i'm uneducated which one did i spell

[01:13:30]  when you go to 7-eleven and convenience store and they just have the whole phone service everything  in one box that you buy now you see this you could buy a cell phone at a 7-eleven just use it for  whatever crime you want to commit at that moment and you're off and running they're  the portables i mean the throwaways the throw yeah the disposables disposables how about that we  got to play the dark angel spot anthony yeah well yeah we were there's a story to this too remember  when we went down to philly for our 100th show we had a great great time we'll get to the pictures 
[01:14:00]  oh yeah oh we'll get i haven't forgotten ben don't worry pictures are right in front of me down on the  phone um pissed off about the pictures that's gonna be a great little story  someone is sweating outside the studio right now anyway we went down to philly and we met with the  the fine staff of wisp we checked out tim and his slacks met the sales people yeah and i i guess we  agreed to something down there yeah you know this just goes to show you we we need chaperones and 
[01:14:30]  whatnot because we get a little tanked up and then we're too nice we're approached by people  or sales people and stuff we agree to everything we agree to everything because it's it's the easiest  way to get them off our back and unfortunately these people go through with it right now we're committed  like what like one of the sales people down there said hey guys um uh fox fox fox tv is making a big  buy with us and uh it would really help us if you guys voiced his spots yeah and we're in the middle  meeting a million people and i i i remember going yeah yeah no problem and like that just like no 
[01:15:00]  problem and then turned and started talking to matt and huggy or one of you know somebody down there  yeah and next thing you know scripts are coming our way and they they're they're expecting us to voice  you know spots for fox i'll buy that whose baby is that i'll buy that remember that flint stones  where he was working and they gave him just the lines to say he was the executive friend i'll buy that  whose baby is that i'll buy that baby whose baby baby all the phone lines are ringing he's freaking  out that's how we are we're just like yes okay fine i'll buy that whose baby is that i'll buy that

[01:16:00]  okay i want to know if you're going to resort to old tricks uh we did yeah yeah that's what we're  getting at nice i think after uh they play this commercial we won't be voicing the fox spots anymore  they wanted us to do a spot for dark angel dark angel uh on fox a show that uh i don't watch  i gotta tell you i don't watch it either but i know the commercials i'll flip around and if uh  jessica alba looks really hot i'll check it out but when it gets back to the regular story crap then i  move on that's that's what i that's what i know about dark angel when she's in that black tight jumpsuit 
[01:16:30]  thing and she kind of jumps down and does this little spread little spread move there oh my god  that's whacking material right absolutely that's what we know about dark angel right box porn so they give  us this uh it's not even a script they're called bullet points bullet bullet points so a script would  be easy that would just be wait a minute this guy already heard the commercial which means they're  playing it because they already wait josh what's up yeah what's up man guys they just played it on 
[01:17:00]  your last commercial run yeah worst effing commercial i've ever heard they played it down in philly already  huh yeah you guys sounded like a retard yeah exactly that's the point see this is our way to get out  of doing them again i swear to god i i thought they would go oh well well i thought it wasn't  scripted no no we just oh okay thank god it obviously wasn't no there were bullet points you guys made  that up josh you gotta hear the sarcasm in the damn thing all right thank god all right a lot of our

[01:27:00]  game yeah without asking our permission that caused a really big problem and then the voyeur bus where  13 of our fine staff was uh arrested arrested yeah and detained for 28 hours as we held a candlelight  vigil waiting for them to return and then the unspeakable horror of last christmas vacation  that's right don't count your chickens yet i saw ed lover and dr dre taking a meeting on the way 
[01:27:30]  yeah oh here's some new york humor for you ouch what happened to them so jeffrey uh you want to talk  about uh the roast with hugh hefner what do you want to know no i was at the taping of the roast  i think you um i think you should be honest i think you should speak your mind i was at the taping  and what i saw was great it was a great show a lot of fun uh some funny comics some comics bombing  but but real but it was good it was funny a lot of fun spontaneity going on and uh it was a great 
[01:28:00]  night now how that translates rob schreiter did that he did three jokes in a row it didn't work  and i ran up to the microphone yeah yeah it hasn't been enough bombing in this city yeah i mean great  screams roars yeah won't be on tv that won't make it no now what have they done because i i immediately  asked you when i saw you what how does the uh edit look because that's a long time that uh uh uh it's 
[01:28:30]  done live and they tape it and then they have to edit it one day i'll be able to put these out on dvd  or something like that but you know for the sake of television it's got to be 44 minutes you got to  fit everybody into the show yeah even the ones that were horrendous even the ones that were horrendous  actually tommy davidson he stunk but they cut that out oh they did yeah he sang uh candy man  yeah but he sang the word he sang uh you say what he said i don't know i don't even remember he  sang pootang man uh oh yeah yeah the the like sammy davis jr the ah and then he sang uh new york new york 
[01:29:00]  straight yeah with a frank sinatra wig and glasses on oh like he was trying to show off his singing  ability there but it was fun you know that's the thing you had to bring a little variety  to the show then i ran up afterwards and i said uh i said if sammy davis jr were alive to see that  he'd poke his other eye out and cut his ears off did they leave that in that won't be on the show  either so a lot of the good stuff was cut from the show a lot of the a lot of good stuff a lot of the 
[01:29:30]  edgy stuff yeah and you know it's still great though it's still apparently people who just watch  the edited version get a big kick out of it it's still funny but if you know what was there it's  sophie's choice if you've been there it's hard to let go of certain stuff and i don't get i don't  get my say so ah that kind of blows though i know like i i saw the live show now i think i i think i'm  going to be a little disappointed no what about gilbert's gilbert uh there gilbert's in there i don't  think he did the uh his empire state building joke didn't make the cut a lot of the i i think the 
[01:30:00]  september 11th material that's sad i think i have one or two references my eva goda joke  i said uh i said uh he's trying to do his part for the armed forces he's going to be a security  guard at old navy right yeah which is really too much reference right yeah you know any reference  to uh anything else was you know donald trump uh he was he is such an he's such an egomaniac he was 
[01:30:30]  worried why they didn't try to bomb any of his buildings and that's out that's out oh man  uh but there's some good stuff in i don't want to ruin the punchlines of the stuff that's in  all right well no it'll be on comedy central i think sunday did you have the roast yeah i tried  to get into the halloween party maybe he got mad at some of the stuff i said i don't know but the  hefner uh you didn't go to the halloween party after roasting hugh hefner i couldn't believe  i couldn't get in we don't have a shot in hell then we got a video jeffrey let me let me tell you

[01:42:00]  i think it's been put in the can to tell you the truth yeah our piece got shelved yeah um we uh we  we taped our interview with him then their production staff decided that uh they needed  some more video of us so they went to our magazine signing party went to the magazine  party at hooters uh this took place about a couple of months ago i guess something like that  to get a little extra footage some of the production staff along with camera people were at the event 
[01:42:30]  um um taping us all our staff of course drinking like fish and uh some members of their staff  drinking also having some fun at this little shindig am i doing good as far as keeping names out of it  if i if i could uh add to this uh there was so much drinking going on some people were uh  two-fisted drinking yes exactly  so just got some setup  hey where's everyone going you're terrible man you are oh it's true awful awful man yeah two-fisted 
[01:43:00]  drinking so at the end of the night some of the drunken production staff got in a uh beer fight uh  with uh the rest of our staff you remember this going a lot of people will remember this story  because it played out on the air got in a beer fight um was being very obnoxious  and then decided then decided to come back to our office i was coming back here because i had some 
[01:43:30]  stuff to pick up when i get back here i see uh one member of the uh o'reilly production staff  at opie's desk sitting at opie's desk on the computer like writing emails to various people  on our show that we read the next day she was obviously drunk and this girl swore that she  wasn't drunk and and uh quite frankly it was uh hinting that she may have to sue hammered because  her reputation was on the line stop it stinky also drunk and stoned i don't want to hear anything 
[01:44:00]  different out of you i was drunk too i came back i saw this happening i saw stinky pull a chair up  and uh they were both uh looking at opie's computer screen okay that's all i saw then i left okay  apparently other things happened that night yeah we kind of forgot about this uh this girl and we've  moved on with our lives and uh and uh well i uh i went and got some uh some film developed recently  anthony film from a camera that had been in the drawer of the desk that this girl was sitting at 
[01:44:30]  and it's not easy to find my camera unless you're a real nosy bitch going through drawers going through  drawers and and you would you would uh come upon this camera if you were nosy enough sure yeah this  camera anthony is used uh to take pictures of the big stars that are on our radio show absolutely  matter of fact after the segment i will be uh taking a picture with mr jeffrey rock yes a two-fisted  drink two-fisted who will be playing the comedy gardens in just a couple hours with richard lewis 
[01:45:00]  tonight and tomorrow bless you sir and uh the most on comedy central sunday so uh this camera's just in  the in the draw and it takes me months to go through the film because it really is just there  it's a it's a crappy camera and i just take photos of all the big stars sure so uh i get the film  developed because i finally run out of uh pictures i'm going through my pictures uh last night oh by the  way sandy uh got the film developed my girlfriend yes yeah she gets the uh and we all know how uptight 
[01:45:30]  my girlfriend could be when there's other girls involved so she's thumbing through the pictures  hey give me a little give me a little uh oh sure inside on some of the pictures she might have been  seeing as she's thumbing through all right one by one seriously there's uh opie with kurt angle when  he was on our all right wwf sure i'll put in my little photo that's nice she must even i'll even date  it she must have been you know nice to see that she's sure room sure then there's a picture of  robert england ah freddy krueger one of the more recent pictures then there's uh mcfoley yeah and 
[01:46:00]  then there's jane's addiction ah then there's uh that hot piece of ass from uh survivor that got  kicked off she's just thumbing through thumbing through rudy uh huh rudy rudy all right liven things  up lots of lots of pictures with jane's addiction yeah and uh those are the ones that come to mind right  now but it goes way back basically a whole roll of celebrities then all of a sudden uh the the uh  subject of the pictures took a took a drastic turn oh they sure did anthony so why is there a picture 
[01:46:30]  of i'll just point out the first one i see uh drunken ben's back at his computer as ben makes his uh two  in the morning calls to all his friends right his drunken two in the morning calls proof that ben likes to  be on the phone when he's really hammered so in my hand uh for the same roll of film that  had all the fine pictures of uh celebrities i have eight pictures and i'd like to go through  them now anthony all right stinky stinky you douche stinky had to be there when the camera was removed 
[01:47:00]  from the drawer stinky is definitely an accomplice i don't think so he was an accomplice a little over  a year ago he was just a little intern a little scared intern that would get our lunch and coffee and  stuff and he's he's now a fine uh employee of the opian anthony show we pay him well and stuff  man has this kid got cocky but that's okay you should see him work the phones with his feet up 
[01:47:30]  oh yeah hand down his pants long calls it's okay he's mike ovitz as the listeners would say stinky  rules all right so the first picture anthony obviously taking from taken from my desk yes it is taken from your  seat at your huge giant wooden desk so i'm going through all the pictures i get past the james  addiction pictures and i go well here's a picture of the back of ben at his desk from your desk from  my desk i'm like now i didn't take that i yeah exactly and i'm like who got my camera and took 
[01:48:00]  this picture that's strange must be just one all right let me get back to the celebrity photos right  i go to the next shot now there's a picture of anthony's area of the office the picture uh during the  a softball game of me my face put on uh who's oscar gamble's uh baseball card right uh my brother did  this artwork and they and they blew it up and and then you have it near your desk still not strange  but just wondering why why would someone take a picture of that this is really strange obviously 
[01:48:30]  someone very very drunk and very high yeah that could be stinky right so now i move on to the next  picture anthony drunk and high here's a picture of a girl's now i'm seeing some flesh now i'm seeing  a picture of a girl's uh thigh with her a little bit of a skirt and it's obviously she's taking the  picture apple ball hanging out her uh excuse me her legs are up on the chair yeah and she's taking a 
[01:49:00]  a picture of her legs and there's uh some writing that says danger with an arrow pointing toward the uh  ground zero if you know what i mean now all of a sudden you're thinking so now i'm like now i know  okay all right now obviously a girl got a hold of my camera after hours in the office and is now  taking pictures you don't remember that drawing though on her leg you must have remembered that  right then and there who it was it says visa card accepted to be honest i don't because this  where this is going back now this is like a couple of months a couple months in on a time is a long 
[01:49:30]  time so i go to the next photo all right ah a close-up of the danger written on her leg pointing  up to ground zero as i pass pass this around yes yes so everyone can see now do you know who it is  i still don't know who this is and i'm like some drunken girl is taking pictures at my desk with my  camera it's like ground zero but it smells worse next picture we're gonna cut that out of the  comedy central version of the opium anthony show you bastard don't worry chicago will cut that out 
[01:50:00]  because uh you know whatever okay another picture of this girl's legs i'm like yeah this girl must  like her legs okay now you know who it is finally the culprit shows herself it's the drunken chick  that said she wasn't drunk at hooters at the magazine signing party she has now taking a picture  of herself next to uh our britney spears poster in the office i couldn't even tell the difference  between the two look how hammered she looks even though she went on our show and said i wasn't drunk 
[01:50:30]  okay her eyes i swear to god you can you could get in your car crank it up to a hundred stick your  head out the window in a hail storm and your eyes wouldn't be that red right stinky had some weed that  must have just so i'm like okay now i know it's just uh this chick from fox it gets better the next  picture is the drunken chick with our very own stinky again she is taking this day completely hammered 
[01:51:00]  with that big goofy smile he does when he's high now stinky here's what i gotta ask you she produces a  camera that was taken out of opie's desk how did you then uh you didn't turn on and go hey maybe  maybe you shouldn't take that camera or go through opie's drawers or i didn't know she got it out of  opie's desk oh really but you knew that she was taking pictures yes all right uh trust me the the

[01:53:00]  me see because i got it looks like posada's mitt when that thing broke when those lacing broke  okay this i can't tell if she's sitting down  is she's sitting or standing and this is taken up the skirt exactly here let me we still  on we still haven't explained the picture look look at what's down look what's coming out from each  side of the uh bikini uh bottom i see that and not to mention what is poking out all right here 
[01:53:30]  let's explain the picture the last so the last picture on my camera classic is a picture of her crotch  it's a crotch shot um and all you see is ground zero well the panties covering ground zero almost  covering because there's some majora some something something poking out over there there is some  majora sticking out just short of minora sticking out oh you don't ever heard of the majora there's 
[01:54:00]  minora and majora my friend there is the uh uh uh majora which is the outermost uh portion and then  there is the minora which if you uh ease uh uh the majora uh to a point where you could look you will  see the minora not minora minora so all part of that area light blue uh panties with the majora  sticking out a little bit yeah legs legs uh akimbo akimbo very good and a uh string yes a little piece 
[01:54:30]  of cottony twine hanging coming out from uh that area it's like a snake zit it's it's it's just  disgusting that is one of the most horrific pictures am i seeing i gotta look again let me  say that is are you noticing down the middle lamp that is yeah i want a string poking out of the area 
[01:55:00]  i want to take a look i'm looking at the there's something going on where it's a wedgie type thing  going on that's the that's the back of the thumb anthony is fingering the right here what's going on  there no i don't see i don't see anything that's alerting me that something wasn't resolved by the  feminine product you know what i mean nothing nothing it's doing its job very well but i do see 
[01:55:30]  a lot of majora coming out of here and i don't know what that means what is that blue green thing  on the bottom that's the thong that's a 2000 flushes but it doesn't match color wise yeah that's a little  weird she's got like this light blue front panel covering the mound the longs and that's just the  thong that you know and then there's this dark turquoise blue thing that's she's sitting way  back with her legs up so you're saying that's the back half oh yeah all right so there you go and 
[01:56:00]  she's got a little wedgie and look look to the other side open of the thong directly across from  the string a little small to notice but look at it ooh that's a white head  she's gonna be on a soprano 
[01:56:30]  the new character yeah funniest line of the show that won't make it unfortunately  again i do it again yeah that's okay because they all show up in the repeats please  i guess we should hand this picture over to uh steve from foundrymusic.com steve if you would take  this and scan it by the way by the way anthony she's 24 years old oh just in case you were one  what can you tell from that you can just i have a talent my friend you can tell from the taint  steve steve if you'd put that on the website immediately of course hey

[02:02:00]  i think it's uh i think it's a plug for uh jeffrey ross uh gig  it's a comedy garden comedy garden tonight and tomorrow that's what it is it's a picture of a comedy  garden exactly it's like a garden down there sure is it looks like it yeah i'll do some jokes tonight  that i that got cut out of the hefrost oh good oh i can't believe they did that can i read a really  a really quick story and then we'll move on to the girlies yeah let's see what happened you were 
[02:02:30]  talking about how clinton's having a lot of fun now that he's out of office yeah he was he was just  recently quoted saying that uh he he could uh do a better job than bush because he's got uh the  experience i got hoes yeah he's got the hose he knows how to deal with people that's why you know  he was in there for so long let me get some colored greens and uh the waitress yeah bring them both over  here he's a he's been drinking with you too yeah now he goes partying and stuff he's been popping up 
[02:03:00]  all over the city hillary you know she's employed so she's got to be places and do things he's just  ah he used to be the president how great was it they booed her in the ms ms that was fantastic why  that was wrong oh stop it you're a senator who cares you don't boo a senator at a benefit yes you're  un-american she shouldn't have showed up she should not have shown up she shouldn't have flashed her  boob is what she shouldn't have done i heard she was shaking her ass shaking her ass  taking that ass she's a senator i see him they shouldn't boo her yeah 
[02:03:30]  kind of i don't know well check this out she comes across as a phony this is what clinton's  up to now she just does when was it that we were supposed to have respect for our politicians  yeah really exactly when did that start what are we talking about here she she let her husband do  whatever he wanted to do so she could be in the white house she's the biggest whore in the country  paul go warm up the strippers oh my god i like what paul just said it's 1940 call they want their  act back oh jesus i don't even get that uh that's the point i wasn't saying in a mean way like no you 
[02:04:00]  weren't fluff them is what i'm saying i didn't mean it i wouldn't mean it in a mean way wow i just  think that uh you know yeah let's get back to the other topic we elected her no more business  in this farewell for you guys who's we the people i didn't yeah a lot of people didn't vote for and  and they were the people that were there at the benefit a lot of them i know you still shouldn't 
[02:04:30]  it's still a benefit and people are showing up and giving their time and trying to raise money for  victims families it's not the place to boo well she was showing up for facetime you know what i mean  she was showing up to get her face on the camera as far as i see that's what she likes doing  i really don't see her as as caring as much as she would like people to believe that she cares no  i think she's a typical politician she's been it for her own this is a stepping stone to hopefully uh  for her to get into the white house or some higher office it's a stepping stone to cervical cancer 
[02:05:00]  so look at jeffrey i have a right to an opinion jeffrey's taking this very  serious are you dating hillary or something yeah i'm i'm stripping chelsea maya oh that would be  breaking news anthony the picture is up on foundry music.com why did you say that now i have to go  to it you got 20 seconds i know before the delay kicks in f-o-u-n-d-r-y music.com foundry music.com

[02:06:30]  a tree knot that's what that's a great way to 269 people she's heavy what does this woman weigh she  looks heavy she looks little in the picture what's that black thing on her thigh that's uh that's the  writing force there yeah looks like a tripod leg right now here's bill o'reilly i can't seem to get  online i'm trying foundry music is a it's very hard to download pictures from actually you can if you 
[02:07:00]  look at it closely you can see the heat waves those little waves of heat emanating from the i just want  to know if it was indeed stinky that took the picture and he swears it's not it looks like she  held up like she just put it under there like yeah she probably thought this would be wacky and this is  exactly what you get aaron what's up yeah i definitely agree she's looking at herself i think  the way it looks like yeah she's holding is she wearing a garter belt i don't know what that is  yeah i don't know i guess her right thigh i guess yeah i'm kind of looking at that and i 
[02:07:30]  can't figure out what it is either i don't know it looks like a mess though she has a vibrating  holster yeah but she has that uh this is definitely that rapid flash there's no red eye there at all  no but when you had the pictures of the uh books on air me she wasn't that bad looking though i mean  the cold i guess well and she had to take it twice uh... uh... uh... if you know what is that  it's what's that scene at it's sammy davis uh... juniors i yeah i can't figure what the strap is  in it and then there's like another strip black strap it looks like and on the lacrosse the waist it's 
[02:08:00]  her holster she has a vibrator people are slamming this picture and uh... the sites freezing up the picture  the beer stinks thank you it's in stink-o-vision  it says danger on her thought yeah yeah someone wrote that  before the beer fight the stinks and hooters with the shillings so we need to talk about  clinton or whatever oh i know let's well whatever he did it's quick it's quick and painless and then 
[02:08:30]  uh... we got privileged girls outside because this is what uh bill's doing these days bubba's big  bridal surprises the latest thing he's uh... been up to in connecticut most brides wouldn't enjoy  having their wedding crash but roberta shimler didn't mind her unexpected guest former president  bill clinton doesn't know anyone involved in this wedding check out what he did clinton stopped by  saint mary's uh... church in new haven where shimler happened to be arriving in a limo for a wedding  on his way to give a speech at yale october six congratulations you look beautiful he told 
[02:09:00]  her you look beautiful you're a hot piece of ass i like that i like the wedding gown thing and then  her limousine dryer asked aren't you gonna kiss the bride clinton posed for pictures and kiss the  pride on the cheek yeah now suck it suck it wrong cheek when she joined her groom at the altar husband  to be edwin asked if the rumor about the extra guest was true uh... she whispered yes but we can't  talk about this right now oh so he didn't even see the whole thing oh and then he's got a kiss the 
[02:09:30]  bride and there's you know clinton lips on there what the hell is that it's the worst wedding music  i ever heard he kicks in there it is so he showed up kissed the bride and uh didn't go in let me get  the story straight he didn't go in he just kissed her outside hung out for a little while took some  pictures and moved on to the altar that's what it was a rumor hey you know the uh the worst part is 
[02:10:00]  when they got to the reception uh during the toast the um the groom stood up and said i can't marry this  woman and uh told everyone to flip their plates over and underneath every plate was a picture of uh  her giving a hummer to bill clinton and um the bride was so uh angry she went home and uh she was all  worked up so she spread some peanut butter right um on herself and she had a dog right and a dog and 
[02:10:30]  you know something though there was a surprise party for her so everyone threw the lights on and there  she was with the day with the dog with the peanut butter but the dog wasn't a dog she had seen it  swimming when she was in mexico and um she took it home and thought it was a sick dog she took to the  vet and the vet went oh my god this is a giant water rat right now that's kind of uh horrific and  later on it was learned that she surfed her way down from the 80th floor of the world trade center  and uh she was fine after that thank you i can't think of any more urban legends well what about 
[02:11:00]  the scuba diver this is the this we must do this scuba diver is the best one oh the scuba diver yeah  yeah yeah so the groom very upset about this thing decided he would um go scuba diving right  they found his unburned body um in full scuba gear in the middle of a forest right which  is odd it turns out it was a burnt forest though yeah a burnt up and they couldn't figure out why  he wasn't why the scuba diver there turns out right where he was scuba diving a plane came 
[02:11:30]  picked up the water to drop on the fire picked up this poor scuba diver groom guy and dropped him  sad thing first time scuba diving ever first time ever yeah well if he was an expert he would have  been uh deeper and uh you know and you don't end up in the middle of the trees right i heard he got  into a fight with a french guy too underwater 60 60 feet underwater nothing wrong with having a  fight underwater dan what's going on it says here yo what's up man hey how you guys doing good  word uh yo ross yeah why you got it what are you defending hillary for man i just wanted to take

See, people that are listening on the air right now,  the reason you didn't hear the end of that is I had to dump out  because Paul had to say some kind of sexual word.  They were concentrating.  You know how hard it is for two blondes to concentrate.  And now they're giggling.  All right, let's see if we can get back in the mood again.  Now we've got to take a break. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, no.  No.  Thanks, Paul.  God damn it.  Wow.  Gee, Paul.  I'm sorry.  Gee.  They were done.  Oh, yeah.  But we weren't.  Sure they were.  Maybe you were done.  Maybe they're done with you.  Maybe you're done.  Why don't you point the finger at the FAA?  You know what?  He really...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah, we've run out of dump.  We're going to take a quick break, Anthony.  We'll be back with the girls, okay?  All right.

I was on a special on Third Watch last Monday night.  I did a special for the New York firefighters.  I was a dancer on stage.  Oh, yeah.  So I got NBC's Third Watch.  Were you naked?  The only girl, you know, they actually showed my face.  Nice.  Yeah, because that's what we want to see.  You know.  All right.  Well, Gina...  Derriere.  Gina Lynn, and what's the German name again? 
[02:32:30]  This is Ivy from Privilege.  Hello, guys.  You got it.  Ivy's there all the time.  And this girl is just as beautiful as Gina.  Privilege Gentleman's Club in Chelsea, right, Ben?  Oh, no.  What's going on with the banana?  We'll find out after this.  All right, we'll be back.  Are you bastards ready to rock?  Opie and Anthony.  And you actually find them rubbing the feces on the wall.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Psychotic apes. 
[02:33:00]  Is this for shock factor?  Oh, my God.  Man, what a day.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  In studio, Jeffrey Ross playing the Comedy Garden tonight and tomorrow.  Woo!  With Richard Lewis.  Brand new comedy club at Madison Square Garden.  First weekend, they're open.  Paul Mercurio.  Hey, guys.  Sorry about this thing.  From the Daily Show, who likes to wreck radio shows.  Oh, come on.  With the guilt. 
[02:33:30]  It's not like he did it.  Let me go to an instant feedback right away.  A Jewish guy feeling guilty?  Come on.  Look at what Thomas wrote.  Who's the fag who made you guys dump?  What a jackass.  I was almost finished.  Oh.  So it's not like people are holding a grudge or anything, Paul.  In the studio, Ivy.  Hello, boys.  Who dances all the time at Privileged Gentleman's Club, 23rd and 11th.  She's beautiful.  5'10", blonde, green eyes.  Yeah.  Perfect body.  And porn star Gina Lynn in the studio. 
[02:34:00]  Hey, guys.  She's performing at Privileged Gentleman's Club this weekend, right, Gina?  Yes.  And if you want to see me, you can see me on GinaLynn.com.  Just type it in.  You can see what I look like.  Or an oyster.  Hey, look at all of you.  We'll see what happens there.  All right.  I got to say.  She'll be a stick and stump.  The funny stripper.  PleasureVIP.com.  You know, you come to a club, you can see what you're going to get.  Yeah, how about they just go to the club and see you in person? 
[02:34:30]  Kevin needs the business down there.  All right, pop in one of your movies.  We got Kevin from Privileged.  Thank you so much.  Something special going on with Gina Lynn, right?  Yeah, she's performing tonight and tomorrow.  You can come down and see her tonight, and we're going to be giving away raffle tickets.  And some lucky guy is going to win a dinner date with Gina Lynn tomorrow night over at Lot 61.  A dinner date.  What are the odds the guy, you know, if you like him, might get some action?  You never know what can happen.  You never know.  That sounds like a definitely, to me. 
[02:35:00]  How about a knee job?  Buy him a knee job.  Buy her oysters.  Yeah.  Yeah, get her some oysters.  She seems to like those.  You know what?  Jeffrey brought up a great point.  I have the crappiest seat in the house here.  Yeah.  I have the old Boston garden behind the pole during the B's game.  Hey, Boston reference.  You're in the obstructed view.  Yeah, obstructed view seats.  They're supposed to rebuild the studio for us.  They're taking their time.  You can pick wherever you want to sit.  You can sit right there.  No, what the show should be is the couch should be where both, where that, where the carts are. 
[02:35:30]  Right here, right?  So that you two are closest to it.  Right.  Why should I get, you know, the guests have the best seat?  I sacrifice for the show.  It's suspended from the ceiling with spotlights.  Yeah, exactly.  I think Mr. Ken Stevens is getting lazy.  He is.  We should have a...  We were supposed to have a brainer studio by now.  There's been days where you have the best seat, though, too.  Yeah, because sometimes stuff's going on over there that I want to be as far away as possible from.  Right.  Like, you can maintain your comedy concentration. 
[02:36:00]  Exactly.  It's just where, you know, it's disgusting.  There's been times, because I'm closer to the lesbian couch, where I had to jump over the console,  because some of the stuff that was going on was quite frightful to the safe side.  You once flew into this last one time.  Yeah.  I was right here.  I couldn't have...  I did a corner of my eye.  I just, woof.  It was when Fat Mendy was going to take your head and put it somewhere.  Yeah.  Well, we got beautiful girls here today.  How about a grand finale from the ladies?  There you go.  Just watch with the language. 
[02:36:30]  We only have four minutes left in the show.  We can't play What Do We Learn?  You got a little potty mouth.  Can you watch it?  Little potty mouth girls.  I love that.  Okay, girls.  Time to relax.  This is the encore, I guess.  We're relaxing.  Keep your mouth shut.  We're at the beach.  Uh-oh.  They had beer.  I hope they don't get inhibited.  Don't make it laugh.  Okay.  I'll shut up.  I'll shut up.  I'll shut up.  I'll shut up.  I'll sacrifice the laughs.  It was Paul.  It wasn't me.  Knock, knock.  Yeah.  It was there. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Right there.  I think she might have stubbed her toe or something.  Oh, you got that spot.  Oh, I got a parking spot, too.  It was a great one outside.  That's what she's talking about.  Oh, who?  Oh, who Yankees?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Right there.  Yeah, put the mic right there.  I was thinking.  By the way, we're putting some footage on Foundry Music.com later tonight. 
[02:37:30]  You'll love it.  I think it'll be headless shots, though, because I don't think the girls want that.  Well, make sure Steve's taking video of their backs, at least.  Yeah, things like that.  You guys aren't paying attention.  I'm kind of loving it.  What's going on?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I'll stand up.  When you said surprise, what did you mean by that?  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  There's some kind of surprise that's going to happen.  When you go through the Holland Tunnel, it has certain twists and curves.  Yeah, okay.  Hey, you know the plot line on the porno movies, we hate them. 
[02:38:00]  Get right to the action.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my gosh.  Right in the comedy garden.  Okay, let's watch.  And let's listen in.  Oh, yeah.  That's...  Wow.  She's ready to giggle.  You guys should have shut the F up.  The Oyster Magazine, right?  I'm sorry, sweetie.  It's all right.  Why are you laughing?  She needs a spotter.  Oh, my goodness.  Look at that.  Hey, Anthony, we're done with the show. 
[02:38:30]  Like a bowling ball.  You just...  Boy, she's very attentive to that area.  You should see what Rick's doing with the camera.  He's just, like, guessing.  He's just, like...  You see that?  Put the camera underneath and just snap away.  Sometimes you've got to do that.  Sometimes you've got to do that.  Oh, my goodness.  No, no, no, no.  Hey, I don't hear her making any sounds, though.  Hey, uh...  That's like the rusty trombone that's going on there, Opie. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The girl version of the rusty trombone.  I'm Anthony.  No one cares at this point, but the Boobo Lantern contest is over.  Who won?  Third place, Ivy, who's on the lesbian couch.  Oh, Ivy got third.  So she's going to win some Aerosmith tickets.  She should get first.  Aerosmith playing in the background.  Nice coincidence.  Yeah.  Second place, Karina.  Okay.  And first, she won a Samsung DVD player, and first place goes to Shelly from Boston.  Shelly.  Shelly from Boston, the blonde. 
[02:39:30]  The brightest fake boobs I ever saw.  Just won $1,000, courtesy of the Opie and Anthony show.  All those results will be on opiananthony.com, and footage of what is going on right now that  we can't describe.  Ivy doesn't seem upset about getting third.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow, look at that.  Two outs, Bob and a knife.  Scott Berocious at the plate.  Oh.  It's a home run.  I want to say that I'm not talking over this right now.  Shut up, Paul.  She's laughing again.  Paul, shut up. 
[02:40:00]  Oh.  Even she's telling you.  Thank God she doesn't talk out of there, or you never would have heard that.  It's a little occupied.  We leave you with the sounds of the lesbian couch.  Sounds of the couch.  We leave you with a Sunday morning.  Wow.  That tickles?  And that's it.  And that's it.  Let's see you guys.  We got to go.  Sometimes when the girl laughs, it's not because you're pathetically small. 
[02:40:30]  It's Ivy and Gina Lynn.  Both appeared at Privileged Gentleman's Club, 23rd and 11th, in Chelsea.  Kevin, thank you so much for bringing the girls by.  Yeah.  They completely rock.  We'll have footage on our website real fast.  Jeffrey Ross at the Comedy Garden tonight and tomorrow with Richard Lewis.  Thank you.  And Paul Mercurio will be ruining someone else's radio show somewhere else.  He's your guest.  Be nice.  I know.  I think he did a great job. 
[02:41:00]  We love Paul when he keeps his mouth shut.  And to the guys that aren't supposed to be here, you're doing a great job.  We'll see you guys Monday.  If you see a law enforcement guy with an erection.  That word again.  See?  That word should totally be allowed.  All right, Ben.  We got to get out of here.  We'll see you guys Monday at 3.  Thank you.  Nope.  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.  A four-hour parade of meat. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  Appreciate it.  I'll see you guys if you possibly can.  Testing.  If you can see me next time.  Let me see you next time.  Yeah.  The Wii U. </pre>
