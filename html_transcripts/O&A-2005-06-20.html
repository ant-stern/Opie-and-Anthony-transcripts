<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with Opie detailing a miserable Father's Day spent at his father's grave in Calverton National Cemetery, highlighting the commercialization of death, the exorbitant prices of funeral services, and the aggressive sales tactics of nearby florists.  Numerous listener calls corroborated Opie's experience, sharing anecdotes about inflated funeral costs and questionable practices within the death industry, including the reuse of funeral flowers. Opie also recounted a frustrating Father's Day poker game with his family, focusing on his mother's terrible poker skills.  Listeners continued to share their experiences with death and the funeral industry, referencing a Penn & Teller "Bullshit" segment on the topic.  The hosts also briefly discussed a terrible Dinah Shore DVD featuring poorly sung celebrity performances.

The show then shifted to a discussion of the infamous Star Wars Christmas special, criticizing its musical performances by celebrities like Chuck Woolery, Barry Manilow, and Chad Everett. This segued into a morbid discussion about the suicide of Herv√© Villachez, followed by a darkly comedic bit where the hosts and callers brainstormed songs dead celebrities might have sung, resulting in a series of offensive and absurd suggestions.  The hosts then described a "media assault" stunt their crew performed, promoting the show behind news reporters covering a collapsed street hole.  This led to a lengthy, scathing critique of an angry email from Mitch Beck, a former radio personality, who criticized the stunt. Opie and Anthony read substantial portions of Beck's email on air, mocking his perceived hypocrisy and lack of courage, and further mocked him by revealing and discussing his website and biography. The segment ended with the hosts playing "Shit Dick" (both the original and a Richard Cheese lounge version) and discussing a Photoshop contest.

Next, the show reviewed *Batman Begins*, critiqued modern movie theaters' shortcomings (seating, air conditioning), and railed against the difficulties of ripping music from copy-protected CDs, specifically a Coldplay CD.  This led to another aggressive and derisive response to a negative email from Mitch Beck. The hosts engaged in several profane riffs, including an extended, humorous, and profane riff on *The Shining*, and made racially charged jokes about a black-cast remake of *On Golden Pond*.  Callers shared their frustrations with the Coldplay CD and movie theaters, with one caller, "Dr. D," offering a technical solution to the CD copy protection problem.  Earl, a self-proclaimed "black gentleman," joined as a studio guest, participating in the discussion and contributing to the racially charged jokes. Steve, a show employee known for his tech skills and access to media, was frequently mentioned. The segment ended with discussion of the violent video game "25 to Life" and Senator Chuck Schumer's criticism of it.

The final major segment began with a debate on the impact of violent video games on children, featuring a clip of graphic video game violence and listener calls.  One caller even claimed to have mistreated a gorilla after playing Donkey Kong. The conversation then jumped to an auction of Marlon Brando's possessions, followed by discussions of parental responsibility regarding video games, a man with an unusual hobby, a prank played on Tom Cruise, and various Hollywood rumors, including blind items about a celebrity with herpes and an audition to be Tom Cruise's girlfriend. The segment concluded with discussions of technical difficulties, a planned segment on 80s music acts, and further digressions into the legality of marijuana, obesity in America, and a bizarre anecdote about a man's problematic feet.

Finally, the show included a short segment dedicated to Mitch Beck's career, detailing his radio show, stand-up comedy, minor acting role in a Woody Allen film, and his current job in recruitment. The hosts made crude and vulgar jokes about Beck's personal life and career choices. The broadcast ended abruptly after this segment.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  I want that back.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down  Syndrome children.  No, baby!  That's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Dylan.  Dylan.  Dylan.  Dylan.  Good morning.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Stop it!  Dad!  Stop whining.  You're a phony.  Hey, this guy's a great big phony.  Hey, you're a great big phony, you know that? 
[00:05:00]  I'm a cop, you idiot.  You're a big fat phony.  How are you?  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please follow the police.  You blew it!  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along for the ride.  Hey, Nick.  You lack discipline. 
[00:05:30]  You can act like a man!  What's the matter with you?  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hi.  Hope everyone had a fine weekend.  Yeah.  Fine Father's Day weekend.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Just want to say hi to everyone else that had to go to a graveyard yesterday. 
[00:06:00]  Oh.  Jesus.  Oh.  Thanks, Anthony.  Not awful.  Horrible.  Stupid me, though.  I'm like, oh, you know, Father's Day is a great day to go to the graveyard.  I don't think anyone else is going to be going to a graveyard on Father's Day.  Ah, you're a rookie.  Oh, man.  Thank God I went early.  Yeah, I am a rookie.  You're a rookie.  You're in your rookie year.  I'm in my first season.  Oh, God.  Oh, is that horrible? 
[00:06:30]  In your first season, I went early and realized, ah, I guess I'm not alone with this death thing.  No.  I guess other people actually do go through with this.  They go and visit.  Go and visit.  Go visit the rock.  Oh, my God.  Go visit the big square rock.  Went all the way out to Calverton and got in line with all the other cars.  Ugh.  Holy mackerel.  Holy.  Holy mackerel.  Not much fun. 
[00:07:00]  Ah, there's miles and miles and miles of cars.  Hmm.  A little traffic jam to get into the, uh...  Oh, God, really?  Into the graveyard.  It's like, God, I have to deal with traffic, too?  People being patient or with a yelling, come on!  That's the funny part.  You see people getting a little pissed off because, you know...  It's not like their loved ones are going anywhere.  What's the rush?  But, uh, yeah, it was quite a day.  It was quite a day.  And then you just realize that, uh, that's another excuse just to make money for people. 
[00:07:30]  People to make some cash.  Yeah, because the closer and closer you get to the graveyard, there's more and more flower  shops, of course.  Graveyard.  What year are you living in?  What do you call that?  You're a little closer to Boot Hill, I got.  I don't know.  Cemetery?  I guess cemetery.  Graveyard.  I'm old school, yo.  They're coming for you, Barbara.  Barbara, they're coming for you.  Scary-ass movie.  But, uh, eh, it went all right, though.  Yeah.  Eh.  Eh. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Just glad yesterday is, uh, over.  Got through the first one.  Got through the first one.  What other holidays do you have left this year?  Oh, God.  Uh, yeah, because you gotta cycle through a year.  Yeah.  Is what happens.  You gotta go through all the...  You got the birthday?  I got the Christmas out of the way, the Thanksgiving, the birthday's coming up, the, uh,  the, uh, the parents' anniversary, which is...  Ah, yeah.  Which is also the...  Uh-huh.  The, uh, the day that we had the wake.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah, happy anniversary to my mom.  That sort of takes away from it.  Happy anniversary, Mom. 
[00:08:30]  Oh.  Painful.  Yeah, it was awful.  But, uh, yeah, we're getting there.  We're getting there.  I just get pissed off by the flower people, though.  They're just everywhere, just opportunists.  I'm sure the price goes up the closer you get to it.  Of course.  Like, if you screw it up and you have to go to the last flowers.  Just before the cemetery, the price is really jacked up.  And they're all trying to just be, you know, subtle about it.  They're, they're, they're little stores, you know, there's not much to them.  Yeah.  They're like, you know, ah, this is our way of showing we understand.  Yeah, we understand. 
[00:09:00]  But just in case you might need something, we're here for you.  We're here.  Bullshit.  We're here to help.  Bullshit.  That'll be $82.  Right, exactly.  That arrangement that we're here to help with.  And then you see something that's, that's nice, you know.  And I, I mean, I don't even believe in the flower thing at the. . .  Oh, you better believe it.  It's true.  I don't believe in the whole flower thing at cemeteries.  But whatever, you do what you, you gotta do, right?  Yeah.  And then you see something that looks really nice.  But then the guilt, because now there's something bigger over here for more money. 
[00:09:30]  Ah.  So what do you do?  You gotta get the bigger one.  You gotta get the bigger one, right?  Yeah, there's a very, a very competitive people out there at the cemetery.  Ooh, he's got a bigger flower.  Are they saying that I love you less?  Right.  Because I'm not getting the bigger thing?  Yeah.  And then do I get the eternal flame?  I don't know.  They got the eternal flames?  Well, it's just a candle.  That's not eternal.  With an angel on it or something.  How eternal is a candle?  I was thinking of getting the eternal flame, but I'm thinking one gust of wind and. . . 
[00:10:00]  It's not eternal.  Who the hell is going to keep lighting it for me?  Extinguished flame.  Jeepers.  I thought maybe they run gas line or something.  Oh, no.  Light it up like Kennedy's grave.  It's your version of the eternal flame.  Yeah.  That's pretty cheesy, eternal flame.  But very interesting, to say the least.  Yeah.  That ain't fun.  You realize you're not alone.  You know?  I mean, there were so many people there.  It was just like, wow, overwhelming.  I didn't know people did that on a holiday, stupid me. 
[00:10:30]  That's the thing they do.  Stupid me.  Come visit the loved one at the cemetery.  Yeah.  Big traffic back up, though?  Oh, my God.  Miles.  Crazy.  I mean, miles of traffic.  Going in, going out.  Couldn't find parking anywhere.  Parking?  Don't you just kind of pull over by the plot?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, but it's Calverton.  The place is massive.  You got one centrally located by a road, or do you got to walk like a mile in?  My brother tells me on the phone about where it's at, and I just start walking. 
[00:11:00]  It's like a treasure hunt.  I start walking with my mom.  I mean, we start the show with that ecstasy of gold.  It was like I was trying to find the right one.  Because all of a sudden, you turn around and you say, wow, there's a lot to choose from.  There's Tuco running around.  Right.  And then, man, then my mom goes, here it is, and that's quite a feeling.  Yeah.  Like, whoa, hey, there it is.  Ah.  All right.  Ah.  But, uh. 
[00:11:30]  Horrible.  But my dad is laid to rest in this, like, field.  Well, obviously a field, but he was, you know, one of the first few in that particular section.  Yeah.  And since, it hasn't even been a year, obviously, the whole field is filled.  Taken up?  Because they pretty much do it by, I guess, like, uh, you know, by the date.  You know what they say about, uh, cemeteries?  People just dying to get in.  Ha ha.  It's a little joke.  But the, the field is just now almost completely filled. 
[00:12:00]  Really?  And that's like, whoa.  That's pretty creepy.  Yeah.  Yeah, people do continue dropping.  That's for sure.  Oh, that's awful.  Nice way to spend Father's Day.  Ah, it was all right, though.  What are you going to do?  Eh, nothing.  Then I went to my, uh, my, uh, nephew's little baseball game.  Ooh, there's some happy, uh, fun time.  It puts it all in perspective.  There you go.  My, uh, my nephew did very well.  And then, you know, he plays with, uh, some of his teammates are a little, uh, a little, uh, limp-rusted. 
[00:12:30]  Wait, wait a minute.  Really?  We talked about this already.  I wasn't listening.  You go to the, oh, you go to some of these, you know, you go to these, uh, baseball games  and, and you see the kids that have skills.  Yeah.  And then you see other kids that, obviously, they're being talked into playing baseball  and they already-  But their interests lie elsewhere.  Oh, they already know they want to be on a stage somewhere.  Drama club, right.  Oh, my God.  I want to sing. 
[00:13:00]  I don't want to play baseball.  I want to act.  See, stupid me, I thought all that, uh, all that happened when you hit puberty.  Yeah.  Some of these guys know, uh, pretty early on.  I thought everyone was able to, let's just say, throw a baseball until puberty hit.  Yeah.  That is not the case, my friend.  You see that girly throw?  Oh, my God.  And they go, uh, when they throw it.  Uh, they're six.  I thought we all started the same.  No.  And puberty hits and then it's like, all right, you go over there, you go over here, you stay 
[00:13:30]  here.  Never heard those stories?  Like, oh, I knew when I was four, I would dress in my mother's clothes.  Like, oh, boy, he knew at four.  Man, I mean, some of these kids can't even, like, focus on even getting close to hitting  the ball.  Really?  And then others just crush it.  Yeah.  Absolutely crush it.  That's when you separate, uh, the men from, uh, not quite men.  Not quite so much men.  I had no idea, though. 
[00:14:00]  I really thought it all kind of made sense at puberty.  And then, yeah, like you start reaching 12, 13.  Yeah.  And then you start, you know, realizing, maybe in a tree fort.  That, uh, certain urges that you're having.  Yeah.  Let me go to Dennis on Long Island.  Uh, Dennis, what's going on?  Oh, hey, guys.  Hey.  My parents were florists upstate.  Yeah.  And once their parents died, they absolutely quit doing all that cemetery shit.  They got rid of all the little vases you stick in the ground. 
[00:14:30]  It was just too freaking ghoulish for them.  They hated it.  Ghoulish.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, uh, you know, it's just another way to make money is what it comes down to.  Yeah.  Well, they were pretty pissed off about the whole thing.  But it took their parents dying and going to the cemetery and seeing it to be like,  fuck it.  I can't deal.  And I want one florist to call up and admit that after, like, a wake is done, they, uh,  drive the van up to the back door and just load the flowers right back into the van, go 
[00:15:00]  back to the shop, take off the name, and then, and, uh, maybe even take all the flowers right  out of the, you know, out of the, uh, what do they call there?  The displays.  The arrangements.  Yeah, the casket sprays and shit.  The arrangements.  And they just resell the shit.  Yeah.  I'm convinced.  I don't doubt it.  I'm convinced because, you know, unfortunately I went through this and, you know, there was  just, uh, flowers coming from all over the country.  From friends, family, fans of the show even.  Yeah.  And, uh, and I'm sitting there thinking, man, we're all like, you know, grieving, obviously. 
[00:15:30]  We don't have our minds together.  And we're going to.  That's what they depend on.  And then we're going to be out of here, you know, well, you know, closes up at 10 or what  have you.  And then, uh, we're on our way.  What happens at that point?  Yeah.  You're trying to tell me that the funeral director goes, well, you know, and throws them  all in the dumpster.  Yeah.  Obviously the family can take some of the flowers, but there's so many, there's always something  left over.  And these flowers are so fresh that you get them that day.  Yeah.  Where are they going?  Come on, please.  They're going back to the florist. 
[00:16:00]  That's what I'm thinking.  Where the, the, uh, cemetery gets the, uh, kickback.  That's what I'm thinking.  A little bit of a kickback.  I'm thinking the funeral home has a deal with the florist.  Look, I'll sell the flowers back to you at the, you know, 20% or what have you.  And you, you know, and then you, uh, resell them.  That's awful.  They have to.  That is horrible.  Because it's all about making money in this country.  You think people are being, you know, they're that nice at these places?  It's all about the business.  The business.  That stupid news station that does the shame, shame on you.  Maybe there's a subject.  Mm, try that out. 
[00:16:30]  You know, you, you set up your cameras, you know, uh, focused on that back door of the  funeral home and see what happens.  Watch the flowers.  I mean, please.  Follow the flowers.  Pat from Unaki, of course.  Yeah.  Pat says, um, it's his first post.  Get a novelty candle that won't blow out.  Like one of those birthday candles that you can't blow out.  Says that will work as an eternal flame.  And then he says, is this Pat, like, coming forward with some actual real emotion or something?  It says, I never met my father. 
[00:17:00]  Is there a place to go where you wish they were dead?  Is that true, Pat?  Wow.  Wow.  A little bitterness there.  Yikes.  Somebody, I think somebody, uh, 40 years ago dumped and ran.  That's what it sounds like, doesn't it?  Yee.  Left mom with her legs in the air, did he?  Oh, God.  Jesus, listen to this guy from Cleveland.  Just don't take anything and as you're walking to the grave, pick up someone else's flowers.  Not like there are cameras around watching. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, no security cameras at the, uh, cemetery, huh?  Yeah.  And then, you know, the guilt they give you when you're going through this whole grieving thing.  Yeah.  And you have to pick out coffins and stuff.  And they basically tell you, well, if you didn't really care about your loved one, here's this little...  Here's the pine box.  Well, it's like, it's not even, it's like, you know, it's just very strong cardboard, basically.  Cardboard, great.  And then you go way over here to the, uh, the Cadillac.  Cadillac, right?  Of the coffin.  Cadillac.  The guilt, it's like, of course you're like, you're moving way over near the Cadillac of the coffin. 
[00:18:00]  Gotta get the good one.  It's like...  I could have put a loved one in a cardboard box.  Because they sell, like, any other product they start with, uh, you know, well, you go to Best Buy.  Uh-huh.  There's that, uh, you know, the VCR, the little one that's 70 bucks, and they're just the basics.  Here's the nice DVD player.  Right.  Or here's the supermodel over here.  What do you want?  This little TV set.  Piece of crap.  No brand name.  Or you have this plasma over here. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  I love my parents, but when they die, I'm wrapping them up in some sort of a garbage bag and digging a hole in the yard.  I'm not spending 10 grand on a funeral.  I love you guys.  It's not happening.  Pick a place in the yard that looks good, a view you like, because that's where you're going to spend a long time.  And then when you have to sit down with the funeral director and start writing out checks for things you don't ever, ever, ever want to imagine.  That's great.  You're like, are you kidding me?  It's like a closing of a house.  Oh, yeah.  Like at the closing, but after it's all said and done, you have nothing. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, no, I was, he was just doing his job, but I was just like, I was ready to swing.  Ghoul.  Because he was just so, you know, casual about, well, uh, paid to the order of, and, you know, obviously what he tells you to write in the check, you're like, are you kidding me?  You can't, uh, what are you going to do, argue it in your grief?  No, not even the money, it's just like having to write checks out for stuff that.  Oh, for certain things that are.  Certain things you have to do to. 
[00:19:30]  Kind of depressing to, like, write it out.  They should have a stamp.  Right.  So they could just stamp this stuff so you don't have to actually sit there and write out horrible things.  Right.  Oh.  Paid to the order of the, uh, the Smithtown crematory.  What?  Great, and you gotta, why would they have somebody?  I got so fucking pissed, man.  They should have a stamp, yeah, that just, like, stamps out what, what they, what you gotta put on there.  All right, let's go to the phones really fast.  I guess I touched on a little something here.  Paul, what's up?  Yeah, oh, the flowers usually go back to the church, like, staring you up when you have the funeral mass. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, I would say, ask somebody.  I got somebody.  Yeah, but then where they go after the church is what I'm thinking.  I don't know, something, something's very,  Something is very, uh, suspicious about the whole flower thing,  because there's just so many flowers that come in when, uh, you go through this, you know,  and, uh, where do they all go?  Some go to the church.  When my grandma died a few years back, we brought it to the nursing home that took care of her,  and took care of all the residents over there.  They were happy, but we couldn't even take all of them, uh, over there. 
[00:20:30]  There was just too many.  But one thing, I'm convinced, like, with the coffins,  you ever notice they never friggin' put the person down when you go for, like, that last final thing?  Yeah.  I think they pull, like, the Mozart, slide the person out.  Okay, bring the coffin back to the funeral home.  Yeah, there's the cardboard one.  Right.  Yeah, but think, like, three, four grand for a fuckin' coffin.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Paul.  All right, man.  Oh, got, um, a little audio from, uh, Pat Romunaki's father.  Bullshit!  It looks to me like the best part of you ran down to cracking your mama's ass 
[00:21:00]  and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress!  Sorry, Pat.  Uh, well, let's say hi to Derek.  Derek, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Um, you guys were talking about when the florist, whatever, can't wait to steal the flowers.  That happened at my grandma's funeral.  Like, it was almost to the point where he couldn't even pick out what flowers we wanted.  They came in the back door and was handing shit out.  So, you know, like, we were trying to pick what fuckin' flowers we wanted,  and, you know, they were, like, grabbing the big floral sets and shit. 
[00:21:30]  Hmm.  It's fuckin' ridiculous.  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt they'd just use those over again.  Uh, they have to, because it's all, I mean, they're, they're, the flowers are perfect.  They're as fresh as can be, and you're leaving.  It's not like you, you bring, you know, flowers home for Mother's Day.  It sits on our table until they rot.  I mean, these things are, like, only hours old by the time you leave.  So you think, like, if you go to a flower shop and buy a bouquet of flowers for some girlfriend or something?  Totally recycled.  That those could have been at a funeral a few hours before?  I can't prove it, but I'm convinced that something's going on. 
[00:22:00]  Because, you know, it all hit me yesterday when I was going out to the cemetery.  Yeah.  That death is just another excuse to make money.  Yeah.  It really is in the end.  Some people have found a great way to profit off of it.  Oh, they're really good at making it sound like they really care about your loved one's death.  But in the end, they don't care.  It's just like anything else.  They've got to hose down that room and get ready for the next one.  Yeah.  We care.  Let's go to Matt in Tennessee.  Matt, what's up?  What's up, Bobby and Anthony?  Hey.  Sweet cheeks. 
[00:22:30]  Hi.  My ex-wife's parents own a funeral home, and I'm going to tell you exactly what happens.  Say your loved one dies, and they have a viewing on Saturday.  And you've got a package deal, you know, with the casket and the service and the flowers.  Go in Sunday to the same funeral home, to a different, you know, funeral.  You will see the same flowers.  Maybe a little bit different from, you know, family members that have sent some in. 
[00:23:00]  But big floral arrangements that were at your loved one's funeral Saturday will be at somebody else's loved one's funeral Sunday.  Oh, so you're thinking that it never really even leaves the funeral home.  They just, like, move it from room to room and just, you know, and just picks it up a little bit and changes it around slightly.  A lot of times they'll take this little bottle of water and miss the flowers to make them look fresh again.  Yeah.  And I'm serious, dude.  Go Saturday to your loved one's funeral. 
[00:23:30]  Wow.  Then go back to the same funeral home Sunday.  Yeah.  And go in a different room.  Yeah.  Holy shit, there they are, the same flowers.  Imagine that.  Wow.  All right.  Goddamn.  Thank you, bro.  See ya.  I love Tennessee.  Calls up with that accent.  I got bored and, you know, I started walking around the funeral home.  Yeah.  This is stuff, by the way, because people are confused.  My pops died last August, but there was other, like, people laid out in a couple other rooms and out of boredom I went in, you know.  Just traipsing around.  Oh, because you're there for, like, two or three days and, you know, you're just like, ugh. 
[00:24:00]  You take a look at the other grieving families.  Just like any other day you're trying to, you know, trying to fill up your day with stuff to do.  Depressing.  So I'm like, I'm here, and there's, you know, there was a body in another room, and no one was there yet, and I walked up to it.  It was like someone's grandma.  Oh, stop it.  You did not.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  Oh, no.  What happened?  I see Jimmy laughing.  Yeah, I know.  I know what morbid thoughts he's got in his head.  You're alone in the room, Grandma. 
[00:24:30]  Just fill in the blank.  Jesus.  But, uh, I swear to you, as I go up to the casket and there's this, you know, Grandma laying out,  she kind of looked like, uh, Mrs. Doubtfire, basically.  Really?  Yeah.  Uh, all of a sudden the lights went out and back on.  Oh.  I swear to you.  And no one was around, and I'm like, what the fuck?  That's creepy.  What the fuck?  And got out there as fast as possible.  Shouldn't have been in there.  That's what I'm thinking. 
[00:25:00]  What are you doing?  I'm like, what was that?  Ugh.  Let's, uh, let's say hi to Rob.  Rob, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hi, Big Big Daddy.  Hi.  Yeah, uh, Penn & Teller was doing a special, uh, bullshit show a few weeks back about funerals.  That's right.  And funeral homes sell these little boxes for your loved one in when they're going to get,  um, for like, uh, when they get, uh...  Cremated?  Yeah, cremated.  Thank you.  Yeah, they sell you a box, uh, so they could, yeah, it's stupid. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Go ahead.  They sell you, yeah, they sell you a box to get cremated, but yet, they'll, they'll say,  oh, you could get the little pine box.  Right.  Or you could get the, the nice mahogany box for like $400, but the box gets burnt up.  Yeah, I know.  So they make you, they even, like, make you feel guilty about, like, a box that you're  going to get, that's just going to get burnt eventually, you know?  Yeah, they're, they're just salespeople, like any, like just the, you know, the gang at  Best Buy or anywhere else.  They, they, they have these words, like, well, you could get the pine box.  There should be one option so that there's no need to get the better one. 
[00:26:00]  Like, this is all we offer.  This is it.  They know you're weak to begin with, and then, uh, you know, and, and they play off your emotions,  and they have, you know, cute, cute little sales.  No matter what they can get.  No matter what they can get.  Yeah.  They throw the guilt at you.  Hey guys, enough with the talk.  Play the music.  Shut up.  All right, thanks, buddy.  Douchebag.  Jay, what's up?  Dude, the worst thing I ever heard of, and I almost lost it when we were making the arrangement, 
[00:26:30]  is we buried my father-in-law in a mausoleum, and they had a, they sold us what's called  a mausole guard.  And what this thing is, is like a tray you'd put under a chicken, and that as the chicken  cooks, all the dripping, hotness.  But, but it wasn't a metal casket, and my mother-in-law had no idea.  They had, they had, we had to buy a $200, basically a tray to put under the wooden casket in the  mausoleum.  So as, I guess, whatever fluids were left in my, my father-in-law. 
[00:27:00]  To catch the droppings?  The drippings.  Yeah, drippings.  The body decomposed, and whatever fluid was left, it was almost like a state law in Jersey,  you have to have this mausole guard, bro, I almost lost it.  The mausole guard.  Mazel guard.  Mazel guard.  That's wonderful.  All right, thanks, bro.  The phones have exploded.  It was just a quick mention, but I guess, I guess we've hit a nerve today.  Yeah.  Kyle in West Islip.  What's up, Kyle?  Hey, what's up, Kyle? 
[00:27:30]  How you doing?  All right.  Yeah, no, I'm sitting there driving home listening to you guys, and, you know, my brother passed  away a few years ago, and then, you know, I'm there with my parents or whatever at the  cemetery, and they're like, oh, hey, you know, you want to see where we're going to be buried?  I'm like, no, you sick fucks, you know, I'm not enough.  You know, they're like 76 years old.  I don't even want to fucking think about this shit.  They're pointing out their grave sites to you?  Right next to my brother.  I'm like, I don't even want to fucking notice.  Oh, man.  That's pretty morbid.  Yeah, I mean, all right, listen, you know, thanks, you know, for, you know, 
[00:28:00]  not being a financial burden on me and my brothers or whatever, you know, but, you know,  I'm going to take care of that at the time, you know, I'm going to fucking nuts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Old people just look at it differently than us, but, I mean, because we still want to live.  We got some years ahead of us, hopefully, and they're all ready to go.  Oh, they're ready to go.  My mom.  They're welcoming.  Hey, bring in the marching band, you know.  I mean, fuck, it's where we're going to be.  I like the commercials that they're showing every so often.  And I see this one where this old lady's going, I'd like to be there for my family forever, 
[00:28:30]  but you just can't.  I don't want to burden them with the cost of my final expenses.  Final expenses.  So she's figuring it out, talking to her old friends about it.  Right.  Yeah.  How are you taking care of your final expenses?  More guilt.  Yeah.  Exactly.  More guilt.  More guilt.  I'm dead.  You're kidding.  You want to leave that burden on your family?  You know, take care of it now.  Final expenses. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, no.  How much does it cost?  Who is this coffin?  Is this?  A few more, then we'll move on.  Because Anthony had a much different Father's Day, thank God.  Ah, yes.  And we've got to get into Dallas and Jimmy.  Jimmy was down there at the improv.  Yes, he was.  Heard he killed.  And we have to play that shit dick thing for him before we take a break.  You haven't heard yet, right?  Got rave reviews.  My God, it's great.  Jerry in Virginia, what's up?  Hey, man, look, I can't attest to what the funeral homes do with the flowers when they 
[00:29:30]  get done, but I can't attest to what my aunt's best friend did after my grandmother's wedding.  She actually took the flowers from the wedding to her, I mean, took the flowers from her funeral  to the wedding the next day.  Really?  Like as a centerpiece?  Yeah.  I mean, like all the little, you know, all the little gray-sized flowers were at her wedding  the very next day.  Ah, who's looking, right?  Eek.  Who would actually know?  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Bunter in PA.  Bunter, what's up?  Yeah, it's Bumper.  Oh, sorry. 
[00:30:00]  When my father died, the guy that was selling the casket, you know, they come up and they  give you this line of shit, and it was just hysterical.  The guy's like, well, I mean, you know, you can basically bury your dad, you know, in a  Mountain Dew can.  This thing made out of aluminum that some kid made in a shop.  Right.  Or you could turn around and they showed us this casket, it was like four grand, and  he said, this thing is guaranteed for 200 years.  And they tell you that, and you kind of go, well, how in the hell are you ever going to  prove that?  Yeah, guaranteed.  Like in 200 years, your ancestors are going to dig it up and say, hey, look, it failed. 
[00:30:30]  Pay me.  We would have been able to bring him back to life, but, you know, this, whatever, this  kid made the wrong choice back 200 years ago.  Yeah, if you would have bought that $4,000 casket, we could have revived this guy.  And what do they do if you dig up your relative at 160 years, and he's like falling all out?  They just give you a new one?  What's the guarantee pay?  What's the guarantee?  Right.  Drive your flying car over to the guy?  That's awful.  All right.  Used car salesman. 
[00:31:00]  Anything else there, buddy?  Well, yeah, and then it turns out, you know, they started to do the makeup, and, you know,  you pay for all this stuff.  Like, I can remember getting an itemized bill with my mom, and we're sitting there checking  all this stuff off, and it's called preparation, which I guess is embalming and stuff.  And then at the funeral, they put him in this sort of red boat.  I mean, they give you this red pancake sort of makeup, you know, and everybody's standing  around the casket, and they're going, oh, he looks so natural.  My dad was a coal miner.  I mean, you know, he never wore a lady's makeup, and, you know, he looked like a fruit. 
[00:31:30]  It was just disgusting, the whole situation.  It just turns you on the whole thing.  They charge you for that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, whenever my dad...  What?  Are you kidding me, Jimmy?  For the makeup?  Jimmy, like he just said, itemized list.  You get a bill like it's, whatever, $200 for this, $200 for that, you know, driving the  body around will cost you this.  Do you want a driver to bring the body from the funeral home to the cemetery that'll cost you?  No, I'll have him hail a cab. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  What are you supposed to do?  Well, you can choose to bring, like, a really nice, you know, limousine or whatever.  Right.  Or hearse, or you could get something else.  Plymouth?  Whatever, yeah.  I mean, you have all these choices.  Just like, you know, you're getting married or something.  Yeah.  You know, do you go with the...  Just like it.  Do you go with the DJ or do you go with the band?  One, the worst part about it with my father is his funeral was already paid for.  I mean, he put, like, $10,000 in this account. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And the gimmick is, I mean, if that's what it is, they're going to try to squeeze that $10,000  out of you.  I mean, you know, it just...  When I die, I hope they just throw me in a dump somewhere.  I mean, it's like, don't even mess around, you know?  It makes you puke, because someone has to be responsible for, you know, paying the bill,  so you're in the middle of doing your mourning, and then the funeral director tries to very  carefully go, well, it's time to take care of some business, and you have to file them  into a stupid office and start writing out checks.  It's like, what? 
[00:33:00]  All right, thanks.  My parents are getting matching Batman masks.  That's what they're getting buried in.  You don't need makeup.  Matching Batman masks.  I hope the two of you like Batman, or pick out a superhero, because that's who you're  getting if you don't have one picked out.  They would look silly, Jimmy.  Oh, well.  That would look very silly.  No, it won't, because the thing will be closed.  We're saving expenses.  Batman masks.  Do you guys want to continue?  Because the phone calls are getting funnier, actually.  A little bit.  Look at what this guy got talked into. 
[00:33:30]  George, go ahead.  Morning, guys.  How are you?  All right, George.  When my father-in-law died, I got talked into the eternal rest package,  which was an upgrade to the inside of the casket.  It was padded silk.  And it cost me an extra $1,000 so that the body could be at rest for eternity.  And, you know, when you're there, you're totally guilted into it.  A month later, I'm like, he's fucking gay.  How comfortable does he have to be?  You need the eternal rest package.  Yeah, because at the time, you're not thinking clearly, obviously. 
[00:34:00]  And, you know, a thought goes through your head, well, man, I don't want him sleeping uncomfortably  in eternity.  It's an eternal rest.  You need the package.  You need the head pillow.  The pillow and the silky button tuck and everything.  You're just trying to get out of that room with that guy as quickly as you can.  You're surrounded by caskets, and he's taking you through the itemized lift.  Oh, I know.  Oh, it's so horrible.  I know what you went through, Opie.  It's really bad stuff.  Well, that's the funny thing.  When something happens to you, you're convinced at the time that, why me, why me, and then  you realize, like, obviously yesterday really, really showed me, you know, duh, everyone 
[00:34:30]  has to go through this shit eventually, you know, and you're not alone.  Thanks.  But it's funny.  The whole, like, funeral shop is down in the basement, and you go down the stairs, and there  it's all laid out nice.  Like, I got, I hate to, because we love Best Buy, I hate to make the comparison, but it's  like a Best Buy.  Like a Best Buy.  But it's like, you know, stuff you're going to need for the funeral.  You know what I'm going to do for eternal rest, and I hope Mom and Dad like this?  Rubber pillows and Breathe Right strips.  That's what the two of you are getting. 
[00:35:00]  So don't start looking at the inside of silk coffins.  Not happening.  Scumbag funeral directors.  Why would they need the Breathe Right strips?  That just helps me sleep, so I'm glad you're going to need your eternal slumber.  That's funny.  Let's say hi to Matt in Oklahoma.  What's up, Matt?  Is it Matt or Mike?  Hi, you.  It's Mike.  Hi, Mike.  I used to work in a funeral home in New Jersey. 
[00:35:30]  And what we would do is, like, the flowers would come in, and then when they would go to  the funeral, or to the grave site, they would take the ones that the immediate family bought  to the grave site.  The other ones, I used to have to take, clean up, make sure they look nice, put into the  next room, and then they would sell them at full price to the next customer that came  in.  See, I knew something was going on. 
[00:36:00]  Scam.  Right, right.  Well, also, when you're talking about this itemizing bills at funeral homes, I've watched  people who had nothing to their name come in there and spend $5,000, $6,000.  Easy.  Yeah.  They're broke, and they're spending all kinds of money.  Yeah.  They just couldn't afford it.  But, you know, they itemized for this, and they itemized for that, and they have a different  guy for the embalming, and then a different one for the makeup, and they're making a fortune  off of it. 
[00:36:30]  Right on.  I mean, literally making a fortune.  Literally.  It's hard, but it's hard.  A fortune.  All right.  A fortune.  Literally.  Not figuratively.  He means it really happened.  They're making a fortune.  Right.  Literally has to be, literally, the most used word.  I know.  The most abused word.  No.  You mean the fortune is a real thing, and not just this, like, intangible idea, you moron?  A fortune.  Literally.  A fortune.  What is the most used word, you think?  Literally. 
[00:37:00]  Literally is up there?  I would say literally.  I got one that beats it.  What?  Like.  Like?  Literally, though, is so misused.  People, people, that is the most misused word.  I literally lost my mind.  You did.  You lost it.  That means your mind.  You've lost it.  Right.  You can't find it, and it really did happen.  Literally.  Well, I've lost my mind just working in a funeral home, so.  Listening to you is making me literally want to kill myself.  That's right.  You're a literal ass, sir. 
[00:37:30]  Literally.  The most used word, though, is like.  Like.  You know how many people are going to laugh today?  Just like.  Just pay attention in your, in your day today, how many times you hear the word like.  It's a crutch for a lot of people.  The like thing.  Mm-hmm.  Let's go to Dan in Cleveland.  Dan.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hello, Dan.  Hey, my dad just passed away like three weeks ago.  Sorry to hear that, Dan.  And he wanted to be cremated.  Yes.  And, uh, these motherfuckers, they want $350 an hour just to have them, you know, at the, 
[00:38:00]  at the wig and a coffin.  Wow.  Every hour is $300.  It wasn't even going to be, you know, burning a coffin or nothing.  Yeah.  And we wanted to, you know, you take them to the mausoleum and put them in a niche.  They're like, oh, you coming on the week, you know, weekday or weekend.  And they're like, well, it's, you know, $250 for the weekday.  It's another $240 if you come on the weekend.  It's like, you know, what the fuck, man?  Right.  Whatever.  I don't know.  It's just bullshit.  It'll get you for everything.  You know, it was interesting to go through that. 
[00:38:30]  It just, you observe a lot of silly stuff.  You know, when my grandma passed, it was really brutal because it was one of the first that,  you know, first person that died that was really close to all of us.  Yeah.  Big family.  But, I mean, she'd lived a great life, 92 or whatever.  And we, you know, you go to the cemetery.  You don't even get to go to the actual grave site anymore, really.  No.  There's just an area where you say your goodbyes there.  And they go, well, that's it.  That's it.  They actually tell you.  But it's over.  They basically say, that's it.  They say, well, you can stay as long as you want. 
[00:39:00]  But this ends the service.  And then you're all, like, hanging around in this room that's just creepy as shit.  You're looking around like, what?  What?  Now what?  That's it.  What?  And then you don't want to just, like, all right, see you later, Grandma.  You don't know what to do.  You know, I guess there's no good way to end this whole process.  You just slowly mill out.  Slowly but surely, one by one, everyone just starts leaving.  And there's the coffin just sitting there in this room by itself.  And you're like, but now what happened? 
[00:39:30]  So uncomfortable.  So a bunch of us decided to go to the grave site and the holes dug, right?  Yeah.  And actually, I guess they take the coffin right out the back door.  And they go right there.  I mean, it's business, man.  They got to move on, move on, move on.  Get the product.  So we go to the grave site.  The hole's already dug.  And by the time we got there, now her coffin's in the hole.  Now, you know, I'm hanging out with some cousins and some ants and stuff.  And people are still losing their minds and stuff.  And, you know, I'm looking at it.  And all of a sudden, I kind of look in the distance.  There's a bunch of, like, Hispanics on the back of a pickup truck with shovels. 
[00:40:00]  Just waiting.  Oh, waiting.  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just waiting.  Like, you think it's so freaking special.  Yeah.  There's going to be some guy in a tuxedo with a big top hat.  Right.  He's going to come over with one shovel and shovel the dirt in.  Yeah.  It's going to be.  A tear is going to come down his cheek as he's doing it.  Yeah.  Are they going to get the perfect dirt?  Yeah.  And just slowly but take their time all day?  Maybe the final shovelful will be as the sun's going down and the birds are chirping? 
[00:40:30]  No.  Oh, no.  It's fucking landscapers in a truck.  It's a bunch of Hispanics with shovels.  Yeah.  And the dirt's all filled with rocks and they're going to be slamming that's on the top of  the coffin.  Guy with the Buck Rogers pack on his back, blowing off whatever is on top of it later  on.  Right.  Like so many grass clippings.  Right.  Leaves.  But you think your family's death is so special.  It's going to be different.  But they're the Hispanics just waiting to fill in the hole. 
[00:41:00]  Yep.  Another hole.  And all they are thinking is, Jesus, we've got ten of these today before we can go home  to our family or to the bar and go drink.  Yep.  Just not special.  You're not special.  Nah.  All right.  Well, I mean, obviously you guys can keep calling with this if you want.  The phones have exploded.  Wow.  There's some good ones still coming in, though.  Paid for funeral with dead grandma's credit card.  Ouch.  Grandfather's casket. 
[00:41:30]  Went on a bar crawl?  John.  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi.  Yeah, when my great-grandfather died, he had like six bars.  And they put him in the back of a pickup truck with a casket the day of the funeral and  drove him to all the bars so all the locals could get their picture taken with him.  Irish?  No.  German.  German?  German, really?  Was he a famous guy or something?  Well, he was down in Puerto Rico, and he was just famous for down there.  He was like a business owner, and everybody knew him. 
[00:42:00]  But it was just weird, because then when I was like 18 hanging out down there, and you  go to the bar, and there's like pictures up on the wall of the casket.  That's a little strange.  All right.  Well, people do all sorts of different things to get through it, right?  All right.  Punch it out.  I sucked.  All right.  Thanks.  Punch it out.  I sucked.  Oh, my God.  Ben's raw ass on Long Island.  Oh.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Ben's raw ass?  Hey, when you were in the funeral home, when they brought you down to check out the caskets,  did you ever see that they have three-piece suits that you could buy?  Did you guys see that? 
[00:42:30]  No.  I did not.  I guess if your loved one doesn't have anything to wear, you could buy these things.  But I was wondering, that must be a rip-off, too, because once they close the casket, they  could take the suit off and use it again.  Oh, man.  You know what?  Who knows?  Yeah.  Who knows what goes on?  Who knows the secrets?  They're all fucking rip-offs, though.  They're all rip-offs, these places.  There's got to be a funeral director out there that is retired and moved on that could write 
[00:43:00]  just an expose on this.  I think that would be some interesting reading, to say the least.  Probably do very well.  To say the least.  Writing a book like that.  All right.  Well, the phones are just going nuts here, but we should move on with some other things.  Anthony, you had a fine Father's Day?  Yes.  Yes.  Went over Mommy's house, and me and my brother's sister, you know, hanging out.  And my brother got, our stepfather, Sal, got him poker stuff.  Seems to be a popular gift, I guess, this year. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  You know, professional poker chips and the shuffler and, you know, a table.  So, we were playing some poker.  Playing a little poker last night.  Having a lot of fun with the poker.  Everyone's playing Texas Hold'em these days.  And it was me, my girlfriend, my brother, his girlfriend, Sal, and my mom,  who I guess had had a few wines during the course of the day. 
[00:44:00]  A couple of glasses of wine.  A couple of spritzers, perhaps.  And we all just wanted to choke her before the game.  I wanted to choke my mother on Father's Day.  Anyway, she was, she's the worst poker player ever.  And when she's got a few in her, you can't tell her anything.  Well, thank God she could sing, so.  Oh, well, yeah.  She's got that going for her. 
[00:44:30]  Thank God there was no karaoke machine for Sal's, for Father's Day.  It was, she's just the worst.  Like, I'm trying to play cards, you know.  We buy in.  It's cheap.  It's not about the money.  It's just about, you know, playing some cards and trying to, you know, trying to win.  Show your poker prowess to the family.  And, um, she, she could have just shit in her hand.  She could have crap.  The seven-deuce offsuit.  And, and, you know, I put in a big bet. 
[00:45:00]  And everyone around the table starts folding.  Because, uh, you know, I pretty much represent that I have the best hand at the table.  You can't fold her out.  She calls everything.  And it was just, you know, she didn't even know what she was doing.  It was annoying the hell out of me.  She, it'd be, okay, it's $1,500.  Okay, that's a blue and a red and a green.  No, it's, just grab one of the, like, you bet $1,500.  She's got, like, $75 left. 
[00:45:30]  You're betting $1,500.  And she's like, how many?  How many is this?  She's got three chips left.  It's like, no, that puts you all in.  You want to, she's like, okay, I'm all in.  And she's got, like, a 9-4.  And there's, like, kings up on the, it's shit.  And we're just looking at her, like, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  And she wanted to buy back in.  Because she lost, like, immediately.  And she wanted to buy back in.  We let her buy in another time.  And it was just awful.  Like, I, I had two pair. 
[00:46:00]  And she hits three of a kind on, she had nothing, just luck of the flop.  And so the next time she lost all her money, we wouldn't let her buy back in.  We, we, we banned her from playing anymore.  Mommy couldn't play with us.  We chased her away.  It's all real nice.  It's supposed to be a nice family get-together.  And we would not let her play anymore.  It was so damn, she doesn't understand.  And she, you know, she'll tip a few at the special occasions, like Father's Day and stuff. 
[00:46:30]  And you just can't talk to her.  Can't talk to her.  Is it a special day, Father's Day for her?  Well, no.  It's Sal's special day.  It is Sal.  It's Sal's special day.  So we go over there.  Right.  And, you know.  I'm just thinking that, you know, the father of her children.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know what I'm getting at.  Well, I'm.  Well, you've gone off on, on their relationship.  Oh, they're, oh, forget about it. 
[00:47:00]  That's what I mean.  So I don't know if calling it a special day for her as far as looking at that part of it goes.  No, probably years ago.  She don't care anymore.  Yeah.  That's like way, way, way in the past.  But, yeah, I'm sure earlier on it was probably, ah, great Father's Day.  Yeah.  Go fuck yourself.  That's what I mean.  That's what I'm getting at it.  Yeah, go throw the spaghetti against the wall.  Poor woman just wants to play cards.  She brought you guys into the world.  No.  She gave you lives and she just wants to sit down and have a few laughs and play some cards.  She's bonding.  She's bonding with her sons.  And too bad.  And the addicts at the table. 
[00:47:30]  And the addicts at the table.  Yeah.  God damn it, you don't have enough money.  Sit over there.  Learn the goddamn game.  Learn the goddamn game before you sit down, lady.  Well, it used to be, though, when you went to these family functions and stuff, you know,  playing cards was all about just having fun and socializing, but poker has just exploded  to the point where you don't want to play with any newbies.  Even if it is your mom or your sister.  That's what it is.  Your wife, even.  You're like, oh, crap.  This isn't going to be fun.  Why got...  Can't you guys go play Monopoly over there? 
[00:48:00]  She's sitting there playing and just going, guy, I hate this fucking game.  Like, what?  Why do you hate the game?  Because I can't win.  She's yelling because she can't win.  And then she's just playing, like, crap.  I guess she likes, you know, playing five-card or something.  Yeah.  You know, where you just five-card draw or something like that.  Nice and easy.  Like, hold'em is a different game, you know?  There's a lot of betting technique and stuff involved.  It's not just about the cards in your hand. 
[00:48:30]  And, oh, my God, she would not fold.  That was it.  I had to fold things like...  I had...  At one point, I think I was holding ace-six.  Well, couldn't you just lower your skills just to have fun with everybody?  No!  Because I know you.  You're probably...  Play the game!  You're, like, folding just about every hand like you would in...  Yeah.  And, you know, when you're playing with real guys or whatever.  Yeah.  I was.  I was folding the bad hands.  Why couldn't you just, like, just go with it and have some fun?  Because I have to win.  I have to win.  She's probably looking at you like, why are you folding nine out of ten hands? 
[00:49:00]  Why are you playing every hand, Mommy?  Right.  She was playing...  So, I would have, like, an ace-six, which I don't normally like to play.  But I was in the big blind.  No one raised.  So, I get a free look at the flop, you know?  So, the cards come out, and it goes around, and everyone's just really betting nothing.  They're kind of a little nervous, and I'm noticing this.  So, I figure I'm going to go in, make the big bet, and scare everyone off. 
[00:49:30]  But I didn't do it.  You hear what he's saying?  Scare everyone off.  But I didn't do it.  Your sister, your brother...  Normally, I would have done this.  I didn't do it, because I knew my mother would have just called the goddamn bet.  People who, if they're broke, are going to call you for money anyway.  You're right.  He's trying to scare off his mom, and his mom just wants to have a little time with his son.  No.  On Father's Day.  Jesus.  Fold the goddamn hand.  Jesus.  She wouldn't fold.  Unbelievable.  Killing me. 
[00:50:00]  You're going to do what we do at my house.  We play strip poker.  Mom tries to bail out, but it's like, uh-uh.  That bra's going off first.  Oh, you're awful.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  That was that.  We had fun, though.  We then popped in the DVD.  I've got to thank Big Kev for hooking me up with this.  He found this DVD from...  Remember the old Dinah Shore show?  It was an old talk show. 
[00:50:30]  She was like the prelude to all the women talk shows.  And Regis also, though.  Well, yeah, kind of.  Because there was more celebrities on her show.  It was, yeah, all celebrity.  It was a celebrity talk show.  It was kind of like Oprah, Mike Douglas, Mike Douglas.  But she would have these celebrities come on, and they're not singers.  They're movie people and TV people.  But somehow, through, I think, drugs or some type of hypnosis in the green room,  these people would come out and sing. 
[00:51:00]  And it was awful.  They had William Shatner, and we all have heard him do his spoken word stuff.  And it's just hysterical.  He goes, Mr. Tambourine Man.  Mr. Tambourine Man.  Mr. Tambourine Man.  But he did a version of Harry Chapin's Taxi.  It was one of the worst.  Take any Shatner you've seen.  It's ten times worse.  Ten times worse.  We were sitting there, and my brother at one point turned and went, look, he held his arm up. 
[00:51:30]  He had goosebumps on his arm because it was such a chill, horrible, I can't believe I'm watching this moment.  Did he bring the DVD in?  I got it at home.  I'll bring it in tomorrow.  I will bring it in tomorrow.  Ben, email Anthony to bring that DVD in.  Yes, and I'm still looking for the stupid Star Wars Christmas special.  That's why we want that, too.  I packed it when I moved, and you know how that goes.  But this one is awful.  Chuck Woolery singing I Write the Songs.  Barry Manilow's I Write the Songs. 
[00:52:00]  That must have been nice.  Oh, it's lovely.  Remember Chad Everett, Teen Hearthrob from the 60s from the show Medical Center?  It was like an old hospital show.  Like any of those are new also.  You watch some old TV, and it's like, anything's new.  It's a hospital show.  And he was singing Marcus Welby, CSI.  He was singing this song.  I never even heard it before, but it was just not one thing on key. 
[00:52:30]  Not one note did he hit that was the right note.  And Herv√© Villachez singing a song.  Midget.  He had his little beans and franks-like fingers wrapped around that big microphone,  trying to sing with that big, fat, midget tongue of his.  His little animal balloon hands.  Yeah.  Animal balloon hands.  That is exactly what they look like.  Oh.  And then...  What was Herv√© singing? 
[00:53:00]  Hi-ho, it's off to lynch my little self, I go.  Did he hang himself?  Yes.  Oh, I thought he shot himself.  I thought he shot himself.  Oops.  Yeah.  You just started thinking of what would have been really funny to find.  No, I couldn't.  I literally...  What a family member would have just laughed at walking in the room.  That little body swinging.  Under the sink.  His weight barely enough to choke him.  I've been here for two hours.  What's happening?  I cannot choke myself.  With that bad mustache to make him look like an adult. 
[00:53:30]  You're right, he did shoot himself.  I forgot.  He still had to use the toe clip, even though it was a handgun.  Oh.  Yeah, the barrel was still too far away.  He walked by a mirror, caught himself eating Gerbers, and he's like,  I have to just kill myself to go.  You know what's nice, though?  I know celebrities can't sing, but have you ever heard Richard Keel singing  You Don't Bring Me Flowers? 
[00:54:00]  God, I'll look for that one.  Wow, now I'm thinking about dead celebrities and what songs they could have sang.  Yeah, Telly Savalas.  I'm thinking I Smell Bit.  I Smell Bit.  Remember John Travolta's big hit?  I'm going to let her in.  Oh, just horrid, and he's lip-syncing badly on the show.  Who else did they have?  They had Captain Stubing from The Love Boat doing a duet with Beretta, 
[00:54:30]  who was just drunk off his ass.  I don't know how they got these people to do this,  but we watched the whole thing because it was just a scream.  John Travolta, letter A.  Look, I'm singing a song.  Something she said has stuck in my head, and I can't get away.  I'm going to let her in.  I'm going to let her in. 
[00:55:00]  Now you're a cunt.  I'm going to let her in.  I'm going to let her in, double J.  I'm going to let her in my life.  God damn it, are you fucking with me?  Yeah.  Big singing career.  I think this is after Welcome Back, Connor.  Nice.  Nice.  Oh, my God, it's awful.  It was nice.  It just has ass sex written all over it, doesn't it?  Man-on-man action.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  I'm going to let him in.  Dead celebrities and what songs they could possibly sing.  I smell a bit.  If Herve hung himself, would he have used waxed or unwaxed floss?  That's very funny, Bill.  Cool.  Bill.  Burt Reynolds was another one who was singing.  What was the song he sang?  Mater D don't...  Oh, no, you didn't.  I was trying to say, Mater D don't grab that, it's not a hat. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, their wigs are really bad, too.  Him and Shatner.  It was during that phase where I guess the big poofy wig was like what people were wearing  back then.  It just looked horrid.  Big, like, pelt.  There was nothing more than a pelt on his head.  You've got to bring that in.  Him and Shatner.  Shatner had, like, different colored sideburns coming out of the bottom of this hair hat he  was wearing.  Big lapels sticking out.  He was wearing a choker.  They're called hair helmets.  A hair hat. 
[00:56:30]  Uh, Billichez.  I got some info on him.  Oh, you do?  And, uh, I'm not...  Elvie.  Elvie.  I'm not, uh, misreading this, by the way.  This is how it's, uh, down on paper.  Internet movie database.  Billichez became alcoholic.  He did.  And depressed.  Is that a proper way to say that?  Became alcoholic?  Became alcoholic.  Really?  Yeah, I guess so.  I would have said became an alcoholic.  I think either is correct.  Oh, no kidding.  Okay.  Learned something new today.  Billichez became alcoholic and depressed, so he missed several rolls that he was offered. 
[00:57:00]  His health problems also increased, mostly suffering from ulcers and a spastic colon.  Oh, my God.  Oh, little shitting midget.  That is just awful.  I grabbed my pants again.  I was going to go for a roll, but I shit myself.  Just couldn't stop drinking half and half.  It went right through him.  He's wearing diapers.  Oh, God.  Little jasimal act duties. 
[00:57:30]  He doesn't even have to buy, like, your pens.  He could just use pampers.  Like, baby diapers.  Oh, my God.  They have little cartoon characters on them.  I shit myself.  Where's my fucking gun?  He got tired of looking at his little feet sticking straight out off the toilet.  He's got to use the potty training stool to take a leak.  Dad's a little toilet paper in his asshole because it's raw.  Nine dumps.  Can't stop eating spicy food.  My asshole is killing me. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, that's horrid.  Poor little fidget.  Oh, yes.  Fantasy Island.  Ow.  The pain.  The pain.  Ow.  My asshole.  Depends.  Depends.  This is Herv√©.  His fantasy is to be in a bathroom and have one solid log come out. 
[00:58:30]  Welcome.  Smiles, everyone.  Smiles.  Get up there and ring the bell, you little French speck.  Depends.  Depends.  Ah, Tattoo, you have shit yourself again. 
[00:59:00]  I can't help it, bud.  You've got to wear that white suit.  I finally beat you, Jimmy.  Walks away with a big brown stain in the back.  Waddles away.  It was so embarrassing.  I had to shake a nugget out of my pant leg.  He couldn't even wipe his own little crack properly.  His big finger wouldn't reach.  Mr. Rock, could you wipe my ass again?  Poor little fidget. 
[00:59:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're getting prepared for takeoff.  The listener is taking over the bit.  Brian, go ahead, Brian.  What about a little flying high again for John Denver?  Ah, there you go.  One of my favorites as a child.  Dead celebrities and songs they could possibly have sung, right?  Staying with the theme.  All right, let's go to Randy in New York.  Randy.  Yo, what's up?  I heard that Shatniss wife could sing anything from Drowning Pool.  Maybe a little duet with Tommy Lee's kid.  Punch it out.  Oh, my God.  All right, back to Villachez. 
[01:00:00]  Anthony became alcoholic and depressed, so he missed several roles that he was offered.  His health problems also increased, mostly suffering from ulcers and a spastic colon.  When he nearly died of pneumonia in 1992.  It was little parrot lungs.  They were full of a thimble full of liquid.  I almost died.  His little lungs.  On the afternoon of Saturday, September 4th, 1993. 
[01:00:30]  93, yeah.  After having watched a movie.  What was the movie he watched?  Oh.  He wrote a note.  He overslept for that audition.  It would have made him.  There's a chocolate factory in my bathroom. 
[01:01:00]  Plastic colon in the chocolate factory.  Oh, wow, yeah.  Well, so on the afternoon of Saturday, September 4th, 1993.  After having watched a movie.  He wrote a note and made a tape recording before shooting himself in his backyard.  Tape recording.  Oh, I'd love to hear that.  That would be nice.  Is there any way to get...  That has to be out there somewhere.  You've got to think.  Someone must have it.  You've got to think.  Wow.  Couldn't take it anymore.  He was married once, wasn't he? 
[01:01:30]  He was married at the time.  His common-law wife, Kathy Self, was that her name, discovered his body and called the  ambulance, which took him to the medical center of North Hollywood, where he died at 340.  Villachez was cremated, and his ashes were scattered off Point Furman in Los Angeles.  They were scattered over a daisy.  The ashes were flicked in an ashtray.  How did his wife just give her the body while the cat was trying to bury it in the yard? 
[01:02:00]  Under some sand.  Oh, my God.  I'm not a big fan of spreading the ashes.  No?  No, you spread them over, like, the ocean, I don't know, or over a lake and stuff.  Yeah.  And some poor guy that just happens to be going for a swim that day has to get a mouthful  of your...  Ashes.  Yeah.  What a...  But was he married before to someone else, or was this his only wife?  Because I saw something on, like, the Mike Douglas show, or Merv. 
[01:02:30]  He was...  I remember this woman was a lot...  Obviously, I was ready to say something really stupid, a lot taller than him.  She was normal size.  And I remember seeing her there, and she was kind of hot.  Yeah.  Like, I remember them being on a talk show, and she was treating him like a child.  Swear to you.  She, like, put him up on her leg, and was like, well, me and her, they get along so well,  don't we, sweetie?  Like, treating him like a little kid.  And he's just, yeah, it's a little...  She got the... 
[01:03:00]  Oh, it's so nice to have a regular-sized woman, not a freak like me.  Little freak.  He was awful.  Yeah, just...  He had the one role.  Poor little guy.  What else was he going to do after Fantasy Island went off the air?  Drink through it all.  Just drink.  All right, let's...  Airplane bottle after airplane bottle.  Let's go to Richard and...  Two-fisting it.  Let's go to Richard in Missouri.  Richard!  Yeah, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  How about Payne Stewart singing Air Supply's Greatest Hits? 
[01:03:30]  Oh, that's pretty good.  Air Supply.  John in New Orleans.  What's up, John?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  How about John F. Kennedy?  Hit me with your best shot.  Ah, that's an obvious one.  Very good.  Trey in Georgia.  What's up, Trey?  Hey, man.  The movie he was watching was big with Tom Hanks.  He just couldn't handle the pressure.  That's why we love it.  Pat from Munaki says, Robert Reed should sing Tainted Love. 
[01:04:00]  That's very good, Pat.  Very good.  I'm on fire.  I'm just saying.  Rich in New York.  What's up, Rich?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  You can always get the Yates Quintet singing Splish Splash.  Da-da-da-da-dum.  Splish Splash.  I was taking a...  A rubber dub just drowning in that tub.  Wishing everything was all right.  Wow.  Jed in New York.  What's up, Jed?  Hey, guys.  Hey. 
[01:04:30]  Hey, I had Susan Smith's kids singing Dave Matthews' band Don't Drink the Water  or Wade in the Water.  It's an old black hymn.  Wow.  Oh.  You have to explain what Wade in the Water is?  We're not racist.  We know what that is.  It's an old black hymn.  Let's go to Kevin in Virginia Beach.  That was Ozzie Davis.  O and A.  What's up, Kevin?  What's up?  Hey, I got two for you.  Christopher Reeves singing Horse with no name.  And Sonny Bono singing Trees. 
[01:05:00]  Wait, singing what?  Trees.  Trees.  Oh, yeah.  By Rush.  Sorry.  All right.  Punch now.  All right.  Let's go to Pete in Connecticut.  Pete, what's up?  Yeah.  Natalie Wood singing Sitting by the Dock of the Bay.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Listeners have taken off with this bit, Anthony.  All right.  Where were we?  Forgot.  How did we get...  Oh, okay.  I was talking about the DVD.  I'll bring it in tomorrow.  Great song selection.  From a lot of us celebrities. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, please do.  Now we're all interested.  Herv√©.  I guess we got to acknowledge the assault on the media that happened this morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a lame attempt here in New York City.  But an attempt nonetheless.  Nonetheless.  One of our guys went over to 56th Street.  I guess there's a big, huge collapsed hole or something.  This happens from time to time.  Yeah, big hole.  Big hole.  In the road.  By the way, you can beat everyone else to it. 
[01:06:00]  The video is up on opiananthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  You get to see the bottom half of our cartoon faces and spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  No Opie and Anthony.  No.  No ONA.  No XM.  No nothing.  Spread the virus with the chins of our caricature.  It was a perfect opportunity to really nail them.  The cameras are just focused on this big, huge hole.  And then they slowly but surely start focusing in on the hole. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Like zooming in.  Zooming in.  On the hole.  Panning in.  And that's when our guys decided to strike.  By the time they got into frame, you could see only the bottom half of the side.  Yeah.  It's actually pretty funny to watch.  That was the first attempt.  Right.  Then there was a second attempt.  Right.  That looks more like people fleeing from a crime or something.  Well, they ran across the screen from left to right with the signs.  Holding the signs.  Never stopping.  Never putting the signs where you could see them. 
[01:07:00]  Signs are like sideways.  And they just run through the frame.  It's the worst assault on the media ever.  There's nothing.  Horrible.  Well, they're not all going to be beauts, right, Ant?  Oh, actually, in slow motion, you could tell that they're running by with an O.P. Anthony sign.  In super slow-mo.  In super slow-mo.  All right, well, the assault on the media continues.  Speaking of which, we're just waiting for something from Washington, 
[01:07:30]  but we got an email from a very, very angry person that was quoted in one of the assaults on the media articles.  Yes.  He didn't like how we trashed him on the air.  Remember, yeah, Mitch Beck.  What's his name, Mitch Beck?  Yeah.  Mitch Beck.  He was quoted in Richard Huff's article that he wrote.  He said that if he was our PD, he would fire us over this whole thing.  No, he'd fire you for suggesting it, actually.  For suggesting it. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, right.  Even suggesting it, because he's such a genius when it comes to radio programming.  He knows what works.  He knows what got Opie and Anthony to where they were and where they are.  Yeah, this guy's just a genius.  Knows it all.  Can I read this quote real quick?  Because I just read this article yesterday, so anyone who maybe didn't hear this.  This is from the Daily News.  This was Friday, by the way.  I'm 100% in your corner on the O&A thing, wrote Mitch Beck.  He's talking to Richard Huff in his original article about being against the assault on the media.  Yep.  If I were a program director, I would fire someone just for suggesting this kind of crap. 
[01:08:30]  It's not funny, it's not interesting, and it's extremely rude and has no other point than to be rude and to promote O&A.  Mitch Beck wrote that.  It definitely is to get our attention, get attention to the show, but it's not funny or interesting.  Do you understand when people are sitting watching that and something happens in the background like that and throws the reporter for a loop a little bit, that it is entertaining, it is interesting, it's something out of the ordinary. 
[01:09:00]  And a lot of people find it funny, yeah, not everyone will, but everyone will find it interesting, it'll catch your eye, that's for sure.  Out of the mundane, everyday news reports, when you see something happening in the back, you kind of look and go, oh, what's happening there?  Let me see what's going on there, that's interesting.  But this guy would have had us, you know, fired, and we responded to it, I guess we called him an asshole or something.  And he responded with a very long email that has a disclaimer at the top. 
[01:09:30]  And we've got legal working on this right now, because we don't think you could just throw a disclaimer on the top of an email and then not be able to read it.  It's sent to us, it involves the show, it's now our email.  This isn't corporate secrets going back and forth that you're not allowed to, we didn't sign any disclosure, non-disclosure forms with you, Mitch Beck.  Absolutely.  There's no agreement between us and you as to emails that can or can't be. 
[01:10:00]  You can't just put a disclaimer at the top of an email and send it out and then have that disclaimer adhered to by the person that received your email.  Right now this email is our property, you sent it to us, and we will read it on the air.  Trust me, we will read this on the air.  And when we give out your email address, we will leave a disclaimer, no one is to email you anything.  Right.  That's our disclaimer, listeners are not to email you.  Exactly.  That's our disclaimer, not to email you any serious comments only.  Nope, don't do it. 
[01:10:30]  That's our disclaimer to our listeners.  Do not email and hassle this person.  You do not have my permission.  Did he underline not and capitalize it?  Of course he did.  There's a man who means business.  You can't just do that.  You can't just do that.  He would have fired you for suggesting it.  Just suggesting, hey, how about maybe an assault on the media?  Get out!  And stay out!  I'm a liar. 
[01:11:00]  This programming genius.  Dope.  And the key in here is was a PD.  Yeah.  Was a PD a couple of times.  You know who was PDs?  You know who says I was a PD?  Unsuccessful PDs.  Failures.  Failures say they was PDs.  All right, listen.  I know we're trying to get serious with this guy, but the phones, the listeners.  Oh, there's more songs.  There's a million laughs about to be had here.  I'll have to go there and then deal with Mitch Beck. 
[01:11:30]  Well, we'll do the Mitch Beck thing a little later this morning.  I'm going to call him Bitch Beck.  Whoa.  Yo, bitch.  Hey, hey, hey.  Bitch Beck.  That's right.  I said it.  You'd be fired for suggesting that in his office.  Get out!  Do you think maybe we can hold up a...  Out!  I want your packed bags on the door.  Packed bags on the door.  Mitch, I'm thinking perhaps we could do an assault on the media.  You're fired.  Mitch, I'm thinking we could hold signs up that'll promote our show behind reporters. 
[01:12:00]  You're fired.  And take your Ziggy cartoon with you.  Yeah.  All right, these are too good.  They're going to start hanging up on us.  Let's go to TJ.  TJ, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  TJ from the BAB days.  What's up, man?  Oh, what's up, TJ?  Yeah, how about Stevie Ray Vaughan?  There ain't no mountain high enough.  Whoa.  Little tough, right?  Little tough?  Very good, TJ.  Thank you.  Let's go to Rob in Florida.  Rob.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I got a song.  Terry Schiavo, Hungry Like the Wolf. 
[01:12:30]  And bitch Beck, he swallowed.  Very funny.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  Very good.  Hungry Like the Wolf.  John in Pennsylvania.  What's up, John?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, how about Kurt Cobain singing Nine Inch Nails, Head Like a Hole?  There you go.  Yeah, that's the obvious one.  Well, the obvious ones are coming in that we didn't think of when we tried to do this bit  ourselves and just said, ah, listeners, help us out today.  Yeah.  Because we were all looking around the room like, uh, uh, uh. 
[01:13:00]  What's the song?  Well, let's, let me think of a dead celebrity first.  Let's say hi to John in Nebraska.  John?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Morning.  Hello, Nebraska.  Lacey and Lil' Connor, Sail Away.  Come Sail Away?  Lacey and Lil' Connor, Sail Away.  All right.  Let's go to Scott on Long Island.  Scott, what's up?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I got the Yates family singing Tiny Bubble.  Oh, that's awful. 
[01:13:30]  You guys are horrible.  Let's go to Pat in Pennsylvania.  Pat.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I got a, I got a good one here.  Uh, JFK Jr.  Learning to fly.  Okay, there you go.  Very good.  All right, let's go to Dave in Oceanside.  Dave.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, uh, how about Lil' Connor Peterson?  Tie your mother down.  Jesus.  These people are brutal.  John on Long Island.  What's up, John? 
[01:14:00]  What's up, boys?  I was going to say, Mommy and Connor singing a duet of Under the Sea.  As he said that, I was thinking that.  Under the Sea.  Very nice.  What's the song called?  The Getting Away With Murder?  Never heard of it.  No, I already hung up anyway, so.  All right, so the assault on the media happened again this morning.  Mm-hmm.  Not as successful as others.  No.  You know.  But to think these news people are doing anything worthwhile, I mean, they've been focusing  on a hole all morning in Midtown here.  The cameras are focused on a hole. 
[01:14:30]  On a side road, by the way.  Yeah.  It's not even a main road as far as Manhattan goes.  It's not a main thoroughfare.  It's one of these one-way side roads.  Although I have to take it.  That is the way you go, right?  Yeah.  I'd just go for like a half a block.  Right.  Mm.  That does suck.  They just got camera crews from every channel just focusing on this hole.  And nothing even happened.  No.  No one was around.  The hole collapsed and they'll fill it up.  Would that just happen in the middle of the night?  Eh.  Who was the first guy that came upon that driving down the road and there's just a huge gaping 
[01:15:00]  hole in the middle of the street?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Bob in Jersey.  What's up, Bob?  President Reagan's memories.  Like the corner of my shoe.  Misty water-colored memories.  Of the way.  Yes, Mommy, tear down that wall.  Little Ronnie.  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  Very funny, people.  Just when I wanted to move on to get this one coming in. 
[01:15:30]  Mike in West Virginia.  Shakespeare and Roy, Eye of the Tiger.  Very funny.  Oh, God.  Let's go to Mike in Ohio.  Mike.  Ron Goldman and Nicole Simpson singing, Cuts Like a Knife.  Here's some.  Andrew saying, Terry Schiavo, If I Only Had a Brain.  Mabel King singing, I Fall to Pieces.  Pat from Monaki, man. 
[01:16:00]  Killing today.  John Bonet Ramsey singing, Centerfold.  Nicole Brown Simpson, Cuts Like a Knife.  Very funny, people.  There's a couple more coming in.  Let's go to West Virginia.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Scott.  Hey, I got Dick Clark singing, Strokin'.  Punching out, boy.  Billy Squire. 
[01:16:30]  That's dumb.  Princess Di, Life in the Fast Lane.  There's Fatty Arbuckle, Salt-N-Pepa's Push It.  Wow.  I can't think of one dead celebrity or one song that might go with him.  The listeners are really coming to the table here.  Well, that's why we gave it to them.  Let them have a little fun.  Yeah.  All right, when we get back, I guess we got to talk about Tom Cruise, huh?  Woo.  Do you guys see the footage of him?  I guess you did see the footage of him getting squirted on him. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, let's get into it next.  Okay.  What a baby.  Yeah.  A real man would have punched that kid in the face or pushed him.  Right?  And what?  Tom Cruise should have done something?  Are you insane?  I don't know if that verbal abusing of people does anything in the end.  That would have been a payday for that guy.  Especially for that kid because he's now famous all over the world.  It's like I was playing a little joke and Tom Cruise hit me.  I need five million bucks. 
[01:17:30]  That's just the way it works.  I do kind of like the way Cruise called him out on it.  Cruise didn't yell and scream at him.  He's like, why did you do that?  And the guy's like, idiot.  Yeah.  He did look like a real, like, well, I'm a jerk off.  Yeah, this is really uncomfortable and I'm looking really stupid here.  Yeah, he just made him look stupid.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll get into it next.  We got the audio.  There's that Scientology mind trick shit on him.  Yeah.  I hate that stuff.  Scientology.  Yeah.  You will not squirt me with the microphone again.  What do you have, a little squirt microphone?  Yeah.  That's what it was?  Yeah.  Where do you get that? 
[01:18:00]  We're trying to take a break.  We'll get into all the details next.  We should steal that next.  Yeah, we should start.  Oh, tell him, Fred.  I had squirting microphones years ago.  Are we a lot of squirt reporters as they're doing their live shots?  There you go.  Put hot oil in it, Stanley.  Let's go to Brian in Michigan.  Brian?  Hey, Blaine Staley, dead and bloated.  Or man in a box.  Jesus.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  So we'll take a break.  When we get back, remind me, we got to play Richard Cheese's version of Shit Dick.  It's hilarious.  Absolutely hilarious.  Oof.  What is that?  Holy shit. 
[01:18:30]  Channel 7, ABC.  What gender is that thing?  I have no idea what that is.  It's some woman talking about cutting calories.  ... and not healthy.  You're very careful to eat healthy.  Good morning, America.  You eat nuts.  You eat apples.  But you're watching all the time to make sure that you stay at, what, 1,300 calories.  We're getting these nuts and apples in a burning house.  I've been on a project for 15 years now, Diane.  So I don't have to think so much about it.  I don't calorie count anymore. 
[01:19:00]  It's the way of life.  How long were you on this before you stopped just starving every day?  Just being in...  You could see her skeleton through her face.  I know.  You could absolutely see her skeleton.  You could see the under, like, where the eye sockets end and the jawline starts.  Yeah.  Oh, I would...  How great would your fist feel just crashing into that bony eye socket?  Just shatter it and call her fatso.  As we go to break, Anthony's mom singing with the help of Drew Boogie doing a little mixing. 
[01:19:30]  Nice.  Lord, would you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  My friends all drive for shit.  I must make a name.  My heart all my life with no help from my friends.  Shut your yaps.  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  Shoot him now!  Shoot him now!  Not on your goddamn radio. 
[01:20:00]  Hey!  Lord!  Shut up!  This is retarded.  Oh, stop it!  Shut your mouth.  What the hell is going on?  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Hey, hey, hey!  Shut up!  Hey, hey, hey!  Shut up!  Oh, Lord!  Oh, Lord!  Shut up, stupid! 
[01:20:30]  Oh, Lord!  God damn, is that funny?  Not on your goddamn radio!  Oh, what a bitch!  Oh, my bad, son of a bitch!  No!  Unpredictable, unleashed, unruly.  Unwashed, unkempt.  I stink.  Best thing I knew, I had my pants down around my knees and my shirt pulled up to my armpits.  Shut up!  Oh, who cares?  I can't believe you fell for that again. 
[01:21:00]  Damn you, Hawk!  Listen to Opie and Anthony every morning, live, from 7 to 11 a.m.  And just in case you missed the show, there are replays all day long.  Listen, stupid.  On the West Coast, catch the Opie and Anthony show replays throughout the day at 8 a.m.,  noon, 4 p.m., and now at 9 p.m.  So stop crying, little girl, and put down those razor blades.  Because you've got O&A all day.  Another message from the friendly staff at the Opie and Anthony radio program. 
[01:21:30]  You're checking out the O&A virus spreading across America, thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  Want to say hi to everyone that got their XM units turned on over the weekend.  Maybe a Father's Day gift. 
[01:22:00]  Well, they say, like, Father's Day is like a mini Christmas for this whole Satellite Radio thing.  So I'm sure we've got a bunch of new listeners today.  A good gift for dads and grads.  Welcome aboard.  Listeners still going with this bit, Anthony, really fast.  Let's go to Mike in New York.  Mike, go ahead.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Jeffrey Dahmer singing Weird Al Yankovic's Eat It.  Hmm.  Not bad, not bad.  Uh-oh, the bit's slowly dying.  Let's see if we can keep it going.  Dave in Tennessee.  Dave.  Hey, good morning, guys. 
[01:22:30]  Hey.  Uh, I got OJ and Robert Blake singing the duet of 99 Problems, but the bitch ain't won.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Jason?  Yeah, Jason.  Uh, Michael Jackson, uh, the boys are back in town.  All right.  Uh, Biv in Seattle.  Biv?  Yeah, Great White burning down the house.  All right.  That's a funny one.  Let's go to Ben in Alabama.  The bitch's like teetering.  It's teetering.  Which way is it going to go? 
[01:23:00]  Go ahead, Ben.  We've got, uh, Terry Schiavo and Hunger Strike from Temple the Dog.  Yeah.  All right.  Bunch it out.  Let's go to Dave in Illinois.  Dave?  Hey, how you doing, fellas?  Hey.  All right.  Uh, Howard Stern singing Toby Keith.  Uh, I want to talk about me.  Hoo-hoo.  Me, Robin.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  That's...  I was saying that all weekend.  This guy's a Stern fan.  That's what he is.  Who?  This Mitch Beck.  Well, that's all right if he is.  Bitch Beck, you mean?  That's what he is.  Yo, bitch! 
[01:23:30]  Jimmy, Jimmy wants to bite someone.  I can't tell you.  What bothers me is that a guy writes an email and doesn't have the moral fortitude to come  on the air and discuss it.  Nope.  Especially a guy who claims to have done radio.  Claims to have.  That makes me so sick to my stomach that a guy would...  And this email is really confrontational and nasty, which is fine.  He has the right to write a nasty email.  Sure.  But to not be man enough or to not have the moral courage to allow that to be addressed 
[01:24:00]  publicly.  Why do you have to hide?  If you want to write things that get in the newspaper, well, then yell at the guy that  printed them in the paper.  And in the email, I'm going to paraphrase.  He says, I'm not a public figure, meaning it's not okay to bash him.  Yes, stupid ass?  Well, you became a public figure when you were quoted bashing Opie and Anthony in the  Daily News on Friday.  Sorry.  You became a public figure when that happened.  They didn't...  No one has ever heard of you.  With the exception, maybe, of family of Mitch Beck. 
[01:24:30]  We don't know who you are.  You bashed him?  Did you ever hear of him, Opie?  No.  I've never heard of this guy.  Let me quote Mitch Beck.  I am 100% in your corner on the O&A thing, wrote Mitch Beck, who said he was on the radio  for 25 years.  25 years on the radio.  On the radio.  What did he do, traffic?  He must have been.  Was he the traffic guy?  Have you ever...  While all the other guys did all the hard work?  Mitch, if I were a program director, I would fire someone just for suggesting this kind 
[01:25:00]  of crap.  It's not funny.  It's not entertaining.  And it's extremely rude and has no other point other than to be rude and to promote  O&A.  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole.  He didn't like that.  Has anybody ever heard of Mitch Beck?  He claims to have been...  Unless he's lying.  I don't know if he's lying.  But he says he was on the radio for 25 years.  Uh-huh.  And I guess he's a little upset.  But, and I'm going to paraphrase here, that some of the listeners apparently have looked  him up, because I guess Beck is not a hard one to find, on the internet, and have harassed 
[01:25:30]  him.  And we would certainly never encourage listeners to harass a guy just for disparaging Opie  and Anthony Paul.  Absolutely not.  And tough shit.  I don't feel bad for you.  I would never encourage it, but I think it's funny.  I don't like you.  There's some great stuff in this email he sent us.  Oh, it's classic.  We got under his skin.  What a baby.  And I'll tell you what, A, he's a Stern fan.  And what this is about, there's a little paragraph in here where he just talks about  what he did in radio and how he didn't want to sell out. 
[01:26:00]  He fucking failed.  Yeah.  You're a failure.  Wait, what did he do in radio?  Oh, he was on for years.  They wanted to syndicate him, he said.  He said they wanted to syndicate him, and he turned it down rather than compromise his  integrity.  Shut up.  Oh, sorry.  This is a private email.  This is not for your radio show.  Shut your face.  You said it to Founcy Music, stupid.  Turn down syndication?  Yeah.  Sure he did.  Yeah, sure.  Sure you did.  That's what he did.  Oh, God.  Is he a revolting bore in this email? 
[01:26:30]  He was probably at a tiny little radio station, and then the owner bought another tiny little  radio station at the other side of the county and said, hey, good news.  I'm going to syndicate your show from the eastern part of the county to the western part  of the county.  You'll be on two stations that cover the entire county.  Out.  From the 100 block to the 400 block.  Let's say hi to Barry in Jersey.  Barry, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  How about Mary Jo Kopechny?  Yep. 
[01:27:00]  Bridge over troubled waters.  Nice.  All right.  This bit is stumbling along, Anthony.  Allen in North Carolina.  Hi.  How you doing, boys?  All right.  Hey, nobody mentioned Christopher Reeves.  Rolling Stones walked this way.  Rolling Stones.  That's Aerosmith, sir.  All right, Allen.  Thank you.  Let's go to Gary in Michigan.  Gary?  Yeah.  Pat O'Brien singing Me So Horny.  Let's say hi to Charles in Cleveland.  Charles?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  How about Owen Hart free-falling? 
[01:27:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  Nice.  That'll leave it, bros.  All right.  You know what really annoys me, too?  Back to the Mitch thing, yeah.  Oh, this guy.  He makes me sick on so many levels.  The subject was your verbal abuse of me on the air today.  And it's like, what a fucking victim.  Yeah.  You were quoted in the paper.  No one in this radio show had ever heard of you, man.  No one knows you exist.  You didn't want-  25 years of radio.  You didn't make a mark.  Sorry.  You didn't want to be talked about?  Keep your mouth shut.  Don't be talking to the newspaper. 
[01:28:00]  That's right.  Don't feel compelled to write in.  Or if you do, at least be mad enough to know that your comments may be published and there's  going to be a rebuttal, stupid.  Ass.  What a coward.  To want to write in and just hide in anonymity and then get mad because somebody else knows  what you said.  Threaten.  We say what we say publicly.  Threaten legal action?  Fuck you.  Exactly.  For what?  Responding to a smear in the Daily News saying that this show is not funny and entertaining? 
[01:28:30]  We're going to keep smashing your face, stupid.  Maybe if you issue an apology, we'll stop.  There you go.  You want to bash the radio show?  You're going to get a rebuttal.  Come on the air, Mr. 20 years in radio.  Yeah, 25 years in radio, if I may correct you.  And you don't dictate how this show handles people who insult it.  You don't dictate that.  You don't get to say what you want to the newspaper and then dictate in some fucking cowardly email  that you don't want to write on the air.  25 years in radio and you want to languish in anonymity still? 
[01:29:00]  Mitch Beck?  I'm not a public figure.  Well then, you know, right?  Next time you sign an MB.  Yeah.  If you're stupid enough to send something to the newspaper that they can legally publish.  All right, we've got to do the shit dick thing as we wait for a ruling on this stupid email.  You got the shit dick thing?  I guess we should play the original, Anthony, because we haven't played the original a lot lately.  Right.  And like we just said, because of Father's Day, there's a lot of new listeners.  They're coming on board every day, so I want to get everyone up to speed. 
[01:29:30]  The shit dick song made us laugh a lot.  And then we kind of just retired it, sort of.  But then Richard Cheese did a lounge version of the song on Friday.  A little lounge version of it.  So I guess we'll play the original here.  Yeah?  And then, yeah, why not?  Why not?  We haven't got a lot of spins out of this one lately.  Yeah, right.  It's from, what, Panzerfaust Records?  Yeah, I don't know who the band is, though.  People Haters.  The People Haters?  Yeah, People Haters.  Makes sense. 
[01:30:00]  The same band that did A Towel Is Not A Hat.  Sounds like a movie promo from the band who did A Towel Is Not A Hat.  Come shit dick.  Speaking of which, 25 years in radio.  Well, here you go.  Here's the original.  It's only two minutes long, and then we'll get into the lounge version.  We hate all shit dick. 
[01:30:30]  Andy Warhol.  Shit dick.  Mick Jagger.  Shit dick.  Michael Jackson.  Shit dick.  Jeffrey Dahmer.  Cannonball.  Shit dick.

Richard Gere  Punch  Turbillin  We ain't the fucking shit  The fucking shit  You're sick  Sick  They certainly are people, haters  Thank goodness  We love that song, though  There's something about it that just makes us laugh every time we hear it 
[01:32:30]  So there's the original  And then Richard Gere came in here on Friday  When Jimmy was down there in Dallas  And he had a fine appearance, didn't he?  Yes, he did  Had a lot of fun with  Getting rave reviews over the weekend about the Richard Gere  Appearance  And he threw together a version of Shit Dick  Right in front of us  Put the music together, the words  That was it  So here's that same song  Done a little differently  By Richard Gere  And his fine band  Oh yeah, that's a little better for me 
[01:33:00]  It's always important to take a good song and  Give it that lounge style  We hate all shit dicks  We hate all shit dicks  We hate all shit dicks  We hate all shit dicks  Andy Warhol  Shit dick  Mick Jagger 
[01:33:30]  Shit dick  Michael Jackson  John Molester and shit dick  Allegedly  Jeffrey Dahmer  Cannibal  Shit dick  Butt slamming shit dicks  Rock Hudson  Shit dick  Liberace  Shit dick  Jim Neighbors  Shit dick  Robert Englund  Freddy Krueger  Shit dick  His fucking shit dick

No  It was like a loving version of shit dick  Like it was embracing the shit dicks  What do we have in front of us here?  Oh  A picture of Mitch Beck  At some minor league  Is that who that is?  Right?  It looks like Chuck Woolery  Chuck Woolery  I guess this is from his website 
[01:35:00]  He looks like everything I hate about radio  For someone who says he's not a public  In one face  For someone who says he's not a public person  It's like he's got his own website  And a picture between like two hockey people  Yeah  He's a wannabe is what they call that  Yeah  You want to be someone who's popular  Who is known  He's failed at it in radio  Obviously he's not in radio anymore  If you were doing well in radio  Wouldn't you be in radio still? 
[01:35:30]  Well there's a website  His website  And you know you want to go to mine  It's eatabullet.com  And you want to go to his  It's crossroadsconsulting.com  And you can see this fine picture that we're looking at  Yeah, handsome fella  Crossroadsconsulting.com  And there's also a bio here  Which I found to be interesting  Which somebody brought in  Of the bio  And this kind of made me giggle  Mitch Beck has spent nearly 20 years  Which it says 25 in the email  But I guess that was a misprint  Mitch has spent nearly 20 years  In front of an audience  As both a radio personality  And as a stand-up comedian 
[01:36:00]  Mm-hmm  Todd, I've been doing comedy for 15 years  I've been doing radio over 20  That's 35 years in these two mediums  Nobody knows who you are  Right  Where are you performing?  Who are you?  De Niro and the King of Comedy?  You talk to two cardboard cutouts?  Who's heard you do comedy?  Ma!  And who's heard you do radio?  No one!  I'm writing this email!  Ma!  Mitch also has been very successful  Over his 10 plus years of experience  As an executive recruiter  What does that mean? 
[01:36:30]  What is an executive recruiter?  I guess that's somebody that  Finds the right man for the right job  Ah!  Mm-hmm  Countless times as a performer  Mitch has successfully interviewed  Been interviewed  And has auditioned  For individuals  And to small and large groups  What?  Boy, it's funny  The biggest interview of your life  You don't seem to want to take  Which is on this radio show  Yeah  Live on the air  Never heard of you  I guess you're not that successful at interviewing  He's been  Mitch has successfully interviewed  As what?  That is a 
[01:37:00]  That's just  That's  Who cares?  20 years in radio  He's never heard of you  15 years in stand-up  I've never heard of you  Who has heard of you?  And you've successfully interviewed  And been interviewed  That means you can answer questions well  And you can ask them  And you can ask a question  That's great  Two for two, Mitch  Wonderful  He has  He has first-hand knowledge  Welcome to the human race  Yes  He has first-hand knowledge  Of what does and does not work  And more importantly  He's sympathetic to understanding  How stressful those situations can be  Huh?  What?  What? 
[01:37:30]  What?  First-hand knowledge  Oh, I understand  Since he has interviewed  And been interviewed  Yes  He successfully knows  What does not work  When interviewing  And being interviewed  Oh, there you go  That was a long way to go  Just to say he knows how to talk  And answer questions  Mitch has learned  How to overcome them  And will share his insight  And experiences with you  So that you can overcome  The challenges  That face you  In this tight job market  What challenges?  Like when you try for something  For 20 years  And you fail at it  You have to go into  Another business

[01:40:30]  I can't tell you how livid I am  I am so aggravated  Oh, a little cross-plug reminder, Anthony  Yeah  Whoa, ho, ho, ho  Cross-plug reminder  Jim Norton co-hosts  XM Comedy tonight  From 6 to 9 p.m.  On Channel 150  Yes  Very cool  I like that picture he used, too  You know something?  In the spirit of fun and parody  I believe that picture  Can be photoshopped  You think so?  I think the people at Whack Bag

I don't like the part in the email  Where he calls you guys  Implies  He says you're Howard Stern rip-offs  And he says that 
[01:42:00]  Tell him, Fred  Howard Stern paved the way for you  So this guy  Tell him, Mitch  I think he's just a Stern fan  Who got a little bit pissed off  And has just taken a jab at you  Publicly  Absolutely  Another person just going for the easy shot  There you go  He's never heard our show  He has no idea what we do  No  He has no clue  Absolutely none  He admits he's not a listener  And he's never heard it  It's funny  Because when people get really pissed off at us  They go down that road  Thinking that's the comment  That's going to get under our skin  That's the one  Oh, they don't want to hear that  So I'll write that  Boy, I'll tell ya  Whatever 
[01:42:30]  We know what we do  We know what we've done in our careers  Dude, I'm a stand-up comedian  I would never write something like this  Lambasting people  That I didn't want read on the air  Ever  I would never hide that way  And I'm a comedian  That's what I do  We're two comedians talking  Right, Mitch?  He wanted to be quoted in the paper  It was his big time to go around his consulting firm  And show people  Hey, did you see my quote in the daily news?  That's right  Guaranteed  He was walking around  Strutting around  Showing people that he was in the paper 
[01:43:00]  Hey, did you see my quote?  Yeah, a little  I'm involved with this whole thing now  Huh?  Well, guys  There's some Mitch Beck on his website  That I want to share with everybody  Oh, right?  What's the website?  Well, you know, he's giving advice and stuff  It's CrossroadsConsulting.com  And there's a question, Anthony  He's good at answering questions  Oh, good, good  Let's get into that a little  That sounds like such BS  How in the world is Crossroads Consulting  Pioneering the future of the employment industry? 
[01:43:30]  Believe  This is Mitch talking  Believe me, it's no bull  And actually, the answer is simple  We're not full of ourselves  Or take ourselves too seriously  Oh, really?  And then this imaginary interviewer  Why?  And here's Mitch again  Because we like to laugh  And have fun while working with people  Are you shitting me?  He did not say that  I love to laugh while I threaten with lawsuits  That's hysterical  You have the humor value of the Lulima trial 
[01:44:00]  There's nothing funny about you, Mitch  Sorry  You are not funny  Or fun  Stop it  Your email lacked anything funny or fun  Or any reflection upon your personality  That shows anything fun  Yeah, I mean  The least you could have done  You're nitpicking and threatening  The least you could have done was write  A kind of legal response becomes necessary  LOL  LOL  At least you could have put  R-A-O-F  Kids, there's more in here 
[01:44:30]  Rolling all over, failure  Because we like to laugh and have fun while working with people  Our goal is to help take some of the inevitable aggravation, frustration, and stress  That comes in the job search process away from you  By being ourselves  And treating you like an old trusted friend  And talking to you  And not at you  If this continues  I'm going to sue  That's terrific  That's terrific 
[01:45:00]  At the same time  We're helping you to obtain all your employment needs  Whether you are in the hiring or job searching mode  We believe  We believe that searching for new employment  Or trying to find that perfect new or replacement employee  Does not have to be such a drag  Why not have a few lacks along the way  LOL  While we are completely dedicated and occasionally professional  Please don't tell anyone  LOL  LOL  LOL 
[01:45:30]  LOL  LOL  LOL  LOL  He didn't really say that, did he, Opie?  Don't let anyone know  We're just hysterical over here  LOL  LOL  That's what it says in those parenthesis  Could you read that in?  It says, while we are completely dedicated and occasionally professional  Please don't tell anyone  LOL  And the way we serve the needs of those who are using our services  Tell me  What's wrong with doing things a little differently?  LOL  LOL  LOL  LOL 
[01:46:00]  LOL  LOL  Guys, a riot  We think there's nothing wrong with taking a lighter approach  And we are really very proud of that  What have we got here, a fucking comedian?  LOL  God damn it  Hartman gets me every time  LOL  I fail to find any humor on that website  None  What a bore  Now lean forward and joke yourself 
[01:46:30]  LOL  LOL  LOL  LOL  LOL  We don't take ourselves as seriously around the office  What?  No shit  LOL  He's great  He's wonderful  I swear to God  I read this email four times  And there's nothing even resembling a laugh in it  Hell, I like you  You can come over to my house and fuck my sister  He is great  He wants us to ask people to knock off the harassment  Like, no one is asking anyone to harass you 
[01:47:00]  No one even was asked to harass you, jackass  So stop it  Stop with your paranoia and your threats  No one is afraid of you  No one from this show said anything about harassing you, you tool  You threw yourself into the mix by insulting this show  And then you send a cowardly private email that you don't want read on the air  Because you're  What's the matter?  You're afraid people at the consulting firm are going to see what you really like?  That you're just a stern fan who doesn't like the fact that Opie and Anthony are doing very well? 
[01:47:30]  Yeah  What's the problem?  Why are you hiding?  No one's giving out your social security number  What's to be afraid of?  Won't come on the air  Let's go to Brad in Virginia  Brad, funny  Let's be on the air  Hey guys  We looked silly after he was through on the air  That's why he doesn't want to come on  He's helping us  Hey Brad  Hey, how's everyone?  Alright  Just wondering what the deal with this Mitch Beck guy is  Why would anybody want to take career advice from this guy who failed in radio?  That's, I, personally I wouldn't 
[01:48:00]  I'm sure some people, maybe he's good at what he does  I have no idea  I don't even know what it is he does  I don't know what this man does  I don't know what this man does  Just tell him you don't want to laugh at his jokes  He'll understand, believe me  Hey, can I get an email or something?  Basically, he shows you how to interview for a job  Right  And if you're like that  Headhunter  And if you're an employer, you go to him  And then, you know, he'll give you tips on how to pick the best person for the job  Right  Ugh  Mm-hmm  Mm-hmm  Ugh  That's what they do 
[01:48:30]  And that job alone has humor written all over it  I've never seen a funnier group of people than people in a headhunting firm  Well, I'm  I'm just known for their comedy  Oh, they're hilarious  Yeah  I just sent Ben a note  I'm saying let's try to get the guy on the phone  And in the spirit of fairness, I mean, we're talking about this  And you should obviously have a chance to publicly, you know, speak your piece  Be proud like you probably were strutting around, pointing out your quote in the article to everybody  In the Daily News  Look at me, I'm involved with the Opie and Anthony show now 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, oh yeah, I had to, you know, say something  Yeah  What they're doing is awful  And, you know, yeah, you see my quote in the paper?  Ugh  Yeah, and be proud like you were when you just fired off this email  Don't expect to fire off a very, very confrontational  Yep  And a derogatory and unpleasant email  And not be called out on the air about it  Right  Sorry, we don't hide behind that like you do  All right  Anthony, I saw Batman Begins over the weekend  Ooh  What'd you think? 
[01:49:30]  I saw it too  Because I know you saw it as well  Yep  Jimmy?  I have not seen it, no  You're going to like this  Is it good?  I loved it  You're going to like this a lot  Thought it was a great Batman movie  Pretty much they made, pretty much  They made believe that there were no other Batman movies ever made  Yeah  They just said, screw everything you've seen  Even screw Jack Nicholson  Uh, Nicholas  Nicholas?  Jack Nicholson  I've been making that mistake my entire fucking life  Jack Nicholson  Jack Nicholson  Here's Bertie  Here's  I'm going to hit that golfer with an axe 
[01:50:00]  I've been making that mistake  My entire life  Look at what you went and did with us now  Oh no  Another ten minutes of Shining references  Jack Nicholson  You like eagles, Doc?  Outside golfer into this  I'm not going to hurt you, Wendy  I'm not going to hurt you  I'm just going to pick up your ball  And throw it in the woods where you can't find it  And cost you a drop and a stroke  Why don't you pick up the ball? 
[01:50:30]  I'm not supposed to  A golfer  You, uh, killed your wife and daughter with a golf club  My daughter found a golf club and tried to hit the ball even though she wasn't away 
[01:51:00]  I had to correct her  Oh, his wife ran in  Why are you hitting the children with an axe?  And he beat her with one too  Because she was trying to stop him from doing his duty  Busy body  Hate that wife  Like if she didn't say anything, she wouldn't have been murdered  Right  Alright, do what you got to do  Yeah  Kill him  This music creeps me out  Brady had a job to do and he did it  By gum  It's the best opening music in the history of movies 
[01:51:30]  I always say it every fucking time  I know  I know, but it is  It is  Every single time  I know  The car driving up into the mountains  Where is it?  What happened to it open?  And we got the shot from above and the music's playing  Oh, B, where'd it go?  It went away  Where'd it go?  I saw a movie over the weekend on cable  Batman?  Yeah, I saw that one  Oh, okay, sure  But I saw it  It was called Darkness  With that, um  That, uh, Anna Paquin girl  Okay  Anna Paquin  And, uh, it was so bad 
[01:52:00]  And they were really  Tell them, Fred  They were trying to rip off, uh, The Shining a little bit  They were doing those days of the week thing  Where it would cut from a scene  And just kind of, vroom  Show the day of the week  And it just didn't hold up  They had twin girls at the end of a hallway  Trying to look creepy  I mean, really trying to just  Pick off little pieces that made The Shining brilliant and scary  And the movie itself  Just awful  This, a bunch of loose ends  That, uh, weren't tied up at the end of it 
[01:52:30]  It was one of those movies that was so bad and awful  And so many loose ends  That you wind up talking about it for hours after it  Like, why did he do this?  It didn't even make sense that  And you wind up talking about it  And then you're pissed because you're talking about it  Darkness  Avoid it  And then, uh, yeah, Batman  Batman  That was, uh, yeah  So they just  Fantastic  They were like  They didn't even acknowledge that there was ever a Batman movie made  And they just said  No, we're starting over  And this is how it's gonna be  Yeah  And the movie was just, uh, man 
[01:53:00]  It was great  Yeah  It was great  It was, uh, it was very dark, obviously  Yep  Not much comedy in it at all  I mean, you get the few lines here and there  I liked, uh, the Scarecrow  Played by, uh, who was that guy?  Arnold Palmer  He was, uh, great  Yeah, the Scarecrow character was great  Very, very creepy  But you brought up a good point, Anthony  And it's something they're doing in a lot of these movies  I think they even did it in the Star Wars movie  The fight sequences  Yeah  It's, uh, you know, drastic close-ups  Yeah, you can't really  That's a new technique they do  Where, you know, you know something's going on, obviously 
[01:53:30]  But you really can't get a feel for the fight  You can't  It's not a detailed, like, uh, fight  Can't see them really punching each other in the face and stuff  So it's a little, uh, I don't know  I don't think I'm into that as much as, uh, the  The knockdown drag-outs that they show in the movies  I don't know  But you like, uh  It's the one criticism I had  You like Christian Bale as, uh  It's great  Yeah, right on  As a great actor  Yeah, and, uh, you know  The movie theater's really got to knock it off at the AC  What the fuck?  What?  What the fuck?  Huh?  What the fuck? 
[01:54:00]  Jesus  What the, what the, who the, what the  What's wrong with the  You have to dress like it's, you know, fall to go to the movies  Yeah  You know, because, oh, God forbid, it's 95 degrees out  So you go, ah, we're going to go see Batman  Why don't we, uh, wear shorts and a t-shirt  Because that's what people wear in the summer  And, and you know what, I'm not going to wear socks  I'm going to wear sandals or whatever  Yeah  Then you go in, you freeze your balls off  Because they feel, they have to make it, what, 50 degrees in the middle of summer?  It's got to be, uh, cold  I saw so many  There's a lot of people  I saw so many people with their short-sleeved, you know, shirts 
[01:54:30]  Like, you know, just trying to get all their  Pull your arms in  Oh, yeah, pulling their arms in  Trying to pull their pants down, sort of  To cover more of their legs  It was just ridiculous  Pulling their pants down  Ridiculous  Yeah  A little, a little  Chilly in the theater  Enough, enough of the AC in the movie theaters  Enough, we get it  Boy, we complain a lot about the movie theaters, don't we?  Yeah  Dude, I hate going to the movies  Yeah  I hate it  I do too, but some movies you've got to see, like they say, on the big screen  And Batman's one of them 
[01:55:00]  You've got to kind of see it, big action movie like that  War of the Worlds coming up is another one  I'll go to the movies  You know, they were saying, I think, this morning  That the movie tickets are down something like 20% or something this year  Really?  It's just, you go to a movie  And it's starting to really feel archaic in general  I know you've got some of these nice theaters with the, you know, the stadium seating  I like that  And, you know, some of these theaters, you've got the love seats  You know, you take the freaking arm up  And you can get close to your honey  A little sex in the movie theater  But in general, the seats are ridiculously 
[01:55:30]  Seats haven't changed in movie theaters  Ridiculously uncomfortable  Since the 50s  How many positions do you sit during a movie?  You know what I mean?  But if you're watching a movie on your couch at home, you're nice and comfortable  Feet up, pillows, what have you  You ever try to cross your legs in the movie theater and within five seconds, your foot is completely asleep?  Yeah  It's like up, because it's up too high  You can't really lounge back  And you try to put, you know, one of your legs in between the seats in front  In that little narrow space 
[01:56:00]  Again, it cuts off the entire blood flow to your foot  And you sit on your right side  You sit on your left side  You scoot all the way down, all the way up  Your tailbone feels like it was hit with a ball-peen hammer  Sometimes you pull your knees all the way to your chest  It's just, it's so uncomfortable  And then the screens  Yeah  You see these movies, but then, you know  The average person has a better system at home now  With the DVDs and your TVs  Nice big screen at home  And if you do the whole relative size screen to distance 
[01:56:30]  You're pretty much looking at the same size screen  If you have a big screen television a few feet away from you  It's just about the same as being midway through a movie theater  In the middle of the movie theater looking at a big screen  Yeah, the movie theater  And the resolution's better at home  They're in trouble, because I read an article, you know  To upgrade a lot of these theaters with, you know, digital and all that  Yeah  It's going to cost a bloody fortune  So they're kind of hoping that people aren't really noticing that  Picture's kind of grainy and stuff, you know  Kind of sucks  You know, in the year 2005, we don't want to see a grainy picture anymore 
[01:57:00]  No  When you have all this digital entertainment at home  Well, I think, who is it?  Lucas is working on that whole thing  Digital delivery of movies  That's what he did with Star Wars, I think, didn't he?  Yeah, but not the digital delivery  He filmed it all digitally  And what he wants to do is be able to film it  Go through the whole process of creating the movie  And then send it to the movie theaters by way of satellite  And then it would just beam down to the movie theaters  And the movie theater would have digital playback equipment 
[01:57:30]  That's not like, you know, the film and the light going  And, you know, actual film that can break  Yeah, and you'd get a much better picture  And the cost would be cheaper  Because you wouldn't have to actually make  All these thousands of copies of films  And ship them off to movie theaters  And then have them trade, you know  By the time the last theater gets some of these movies  The copies, they're shit  They're ripped up  You see the scratches at the end of the reels and everything  That one pubic hair every once in a while 
[01:58:00]  One pube  Dancing across the screen  But, you know, you get the first run  But then the movie theaters that are scheduled to get it last run  They wind up getting copies of these movies  That are just scratched to shit  And, you know, taped together  I'd love to know, though, if it's digitally sent  Someone's going to find a way to intercept them  That's the big problem  Although they will have, like, a coding or something  But someone will figure out how to steal it  Well, that's what everyone's saying  Is that if they start doing that  You're going to be able to pull these movies out of the sky  And, you know, there's going to be a problem  But they'll encrypt it  And someone will break the encryption  And, by the way, also, while we're talking about entertainment 
[01:58:30]  Fuck Coldplay  Go fuck yourselves  Why, Opie?  Kind of a fan of Coldplay and stuff  Their new CD comes out, right?  This is another problem that's happening  You know, now the artists are now  Now they're going to, you know  Take advantage of us again  Yeah  All right?  Because what's happening  I think the Foo Fighters did the same thing  At this point, a lot of us have, you know  iTunes or Music Match or something, right?  Our computers are becoming the place 
[01:59:00]  Where we're just throwing all our CDs, right?  I mean, you have it too, right?  Sure  So what do you do when you buy an album?  And I actually did buy  I didn't go to, you know, Earl Tunes for this one  I actually went out and got the Coldplay CD  And I'm like, all right  I want to throw it on my computer  I have it part of my iTunes  So when I'm party shuffling  Get a nice little, you know  A new Coldplay song  What have you  Yep  Can't fucking download it to my iTunes  That's the new thing that they're doing with these new CDs  And the bands, you know  They don't tell you  And most people, I swear to God  There's so many people out there that are buying these CDs 
[01:59:30]  And then they will go home  And just because it's easy  They've thrown it on their iTunes as well  So now you're buying the album, right?  Assuming you can throw it on your iTunes  You can't  So you already have all your music on the iTunes  What are you going to do?  Not now go to iTunes.com or what have you  And now download another copy of Coldplay  So you have it on your iTunes?  You can get it from iTunes.com  I'm sure you can, right?  Scumbag  But you can't  You know what?  So now you're  Now hardcore fans of Coldplay  I guarantee  They're buying 
[02:00:00]  Now they're buying the album twice  Because they didn't know  When they went to the record store  That that copy they bought  They can't get on their iTunes  Download a crack  There's cracks for those out there  You just  Download the program  Run it through it  And then you can use it  You can't  People sent me links for that  Absolutely  What you can do is  You can convert things  Where they can go on your iTunes  Yep  Please send me that again  Seriously  I don't have any more  But I  These artists that do this shit  Makes you sick to your stomach  Yeah but it's a small percentage  That are going to be able to figure out  A way around this  And I'm thinking  You've got to be kidding me  You know  You've got to be kidding me 
[02:00:30]  Yeah what a scumbag  You bought the goddamn record  I should be able to put it on  You know  My iPod  That's technically my  My home theater now  I mean you know  I got all my freaking songs  On my computer  You know  Because no one carries  A CD player anymore  You don't carry one  You carry your stupid iPod  But you know  If you're a fan of the band  What are you going to say  Oh fuck Coldplay  I'm not going to throw them  On my iTunes  Of course you're now  Going to go try to find  Another version online  That you can download  Right into your iTunes  There are ways  It's an inconvenient thing  But to save yourself the money  And again I know 
[02:01:00]  There's cracks that are much easier  Yeah  But there's a way to upload it  On to your computer  And one of the problems I had  Was I couldn't get stuff  On to iTunes  Because I fucking hate  Everything Apple  Makes me sick  Because my iTunes will play  On my computer  And all of a sudden  It starts going  Like some noise  Starts happening in it  And then if I pause it  And then hit play again  It stops  So there's something wrong  With my piece of shit  iPod and iTunes  I fucking hate  Everything iPod iTunes  They always have problems  So whatever  Okay  So you spoke to  Mac works great with it  Does it really?  iTunes works a lot better 
[02:01:30]  On Mac  Well it still should work  For PC  I mean come on  There's a Windows Media  Player on Mac  In fairness  I've never had problems  With my iTunes at all  I had a few problems  When I was using it  On my Windows  Yeah  Because I have both at home  I got like  I need two computers  Right in front of me  At all times  One Mac  And one Windows  Dude I loved my iPod  When I first got it  I couldn't believe  This little invention  I could have all my fun songs on  And then it just started  Freezing up on me  And I wanted to throw it  Through the window  But then I'm like  You can't return it  If you do that  Maybe it was just  Repulsed by your selection  Of music  What I happen to have  Some very good 
[02:02:00]  Karma Chameleon  And YMCA  Neither one of those  Are on there  But believe me  Those guilty pleasures  I have  Oh  I was obsessed with  This one song  I heard in this girl's car  And I couldn't figure out  What it was  Oh god  Dude I loved it  It was fucking  Rosemary Clooney  Come on to my house  Are you kidding me?  A Rosemary Clooney song  Come on to my house  I'm a 70 year old  Italian grandmother  What the hell is that?  I heard it in some girl's car  Sorry go ahead  Oh Jimmy's gonna get to hear it  Look he's all excited 
[02:02:30]  I love this song  You're kidding right?  No it's good  Come on to my house  My house  I'm gonna give you candy  Come on to my house  My house  I'm gonna give you  Apple, plum  And I forgot to do it  Come on to my house  My house  Come on  Come on to my house  My house  Come on  Come on to my house  My house  I'm gonna give you  There's no moolies here  Come on to my house 
[02:03:00]  My house  Come on  Come on to my house  Maybe you should tell them  What they  Everyone else seems to know  Come on to my house  Cause I'm gonna give you candy  Okay terrific  Put in a little sausage  Your wine  I want an apple and a plums  From your grandson Frank  Let's go to Jack  Hey Jack what's up  Hey what's going on  Hey  What's called  I was saying on the  Foo Fighters CD there  What they do is  You can put the CD in  And they have 
[02:03:30]  A program comes up  And basically what it does  You can rip the whole CD from that  Alright well it would be nice  If these bands told us that  Maybe in the record store  Look you might have a problem  You know downloading this  To your iTunes or something  No yeah what's called  I know the CD doesn't mention anything  It says the CD's enhanced  And shit like that  But basically what it is  It's just  I'm telling you  It's turning out to be  Like an arms race  The consumer against the record companies  And vice versa  You know one screws the other  And the other one screws  The other one back  I know basically  Ever since Lawrence  What's called  Had the problem with Naps  Or something  It's been just a big 
[02:04:00]  Battle since then  And then you got programs  Coming out to  You know get past this  And then well  The record companies know  That programs out there  So now they do this  It's  I know  When you first put the  If you try to use  If you don't like  Download the songs  Right off of their program  The Foo Fighters program  Yeah  What's it called  You try to just play it  On a Windows Media Player  It like plays a song  All crackled up  And shit like that  It's really annoying  Well I don't mind them  Trying to fight piracy  Because they were losing millions  Man like  You produce a product like that  You want to get paid for it  There's nothing wrong with that  They've been ripping us off  For years  Well that's the flip side  I was a little taut  But if you buy the CD 
[02:04:30]  You should be able to do  Whatever the hell you want  With it  Especially if it's  Your own personal use  Like they have a problem  If you put it online  And stuff like that  But if you just want to  Transfer it from the CD  To another medium  That you can then listen to it  They should let you do that  I guess they don't want it  To make it too easy  To put online  Let's go to  The owner of Earl Tunes  Black Earl  What's up  What's happening brothers  I got a couple questions  Because you know  You're a black gentleman  First  What do you got on this 
[02:05:00]  Whole Coldplay thing  I can't get it on my iTunes  Oh it stinks  They should put some type  Of disclaimer  On the jewel case  They should I think  I really think  They should do that  Because they know  A lot of people  Are now using their computers  As kind of their home system  Whatever  For playing music  Yeah just about  Everyone I know now  When they buy the CD  The first thing they do  Is they slap it on their iPod  Right  Don't even listen to the CD  On a regular CD player  Without a doubt  I bring the thing home  And I get it on my computer  And on my iPod  That's it  I never actually listen 
[02:05:30]  To the CD physically  You're right  Well what happens  When you put the CD in  What does it say  It doesn't say anything  It just kind of gurgles along  It's just  I don't know  It's just a weird noise  And it never boots up  Because I heard  There was something  In the actual iPod things  Or on the iTunes  Where they won't  Give the licensing  Or certain things  To the record companies  Which enables them  To make it compatible  I don't know if that's true  Yeah I was reading  Something about that  I don't know if that's  What you're talking about  You could pull anything  Off of anything man  If you got the right program  Movies come off of DVDs 
[02:06:00]  Doesn't matter what the hell  They got on there  I'm just saying  You know  We're lucky  We got a Steve  Or somebody we know  In the background  I mean there's a lot of people  They don't know how to  Work their way around this shit  That's lucky  Can you pick a better example  Of when you say  When you're lucky  Can you say you have  Something other than Steve  Steve is a freaking  Tech guru  He certainly is  But he's a big monster  With tattoos and shorts  And perfect diction  He's not good luck  I will have you  Put anything off of anything  Whatever you need 
[02:06:30]  So basically  You didn't like  Your copy of  The Incredibles  That we got a year ago  Dude I loved my copy  The Incredibles  And the Batman copy  He's been distributing  Around the office  Oh fantastic  Thank you Steve  When I watched  War of the Worlds  At home  Before it even came out  It was amazing dude  He has cruises outtakes  I've been distributing  Through Foundry  Just to have to  PayPal it  By the way  Because everyone's like  Going oh my god  And that is obviously  A joke  Of course it is  Of course  We don't need  The fucking FBI  After all  I haven't gotten 
[02:07:00]  Movies from Steve  In a long time  I really haven't  I haven't gotten one  There was a time  We used to have  Some fun with that  But then it got  A little too dangerous  That's all I'm saying  So I asked that dummy  To give me the Aussie footage  That he shot in here  And it took him six weeks  When did he ever have films  Earl so what else  You got on that  No it's just  There's certain brands  Of CD  Record companies  To watch out for  Like the BMG stuff  Like Foo Fighters  Kings of Leon  You know  Even OutKat  You load it 
[02:07:30]  Some of it will load  Into the iTunes  But when you play it  It sounds like  Scratchy  And it'll skip a lot  And just totally  Screw up your iPod  Ah  But Earl  What is it in the  Earl what is it in the  iTunes that will make it  Less compatible  With the Windows program  Shut up  I'm not really sure  I think you got to  Ask the Steve questions  Alright  Did you hear there  There's a black version  Of Angolan Pond  On Broadway  No I haven't  Yeah what the hell  Is that about  With what  James Earl Jones 
[02:08:00]  Is it James Earl Jones  And Leslie Uggams  And Leslie Uggams  And Leslie Uggams  Uggams  Uggams  Now that she's a little older  Her last name's perfect  Ugg  Ugg  What  Again  Another movie  That we saw  Growing up  With Henry Fonda  And who was  What's her name  Catherine Hepburn  Catherine Hepburn  Of course  Did on Golden Pond  And now you got to get  The black cast  Doing it

[02:12:30]  Makes me really annoyed  How dare you  This is a place  Of business  Of course it is  It's a public website  Call your lawyer  Comedian  Go ahead  Funny man  Funny man  LOL  You should have  Put a few LOLs  In the email  Yeah  I'm a comedian  I'm not calling  Any lawyers  Let's say hi  To Dr. D  Dr. D  What's up  Hi doc  Good morning  Hey Opie  I've got a solution  For your CD woes  Now this is 
[02:13:00]  There's no guarantee  This could work  But a little known secret  Whenever you put a CD in  If it's got some kind  Of copy protection on it  It will load  A program  That keeps you from  Doing what you want  To do with it  If you're using  Windows  What you can do  Is as soon as  You insert the CD  Hold down your  Left shift button  And that's a  Windows feature  That allows you  To keep that program  From loading  I don't know  That it will work  For certainty  But that's what  I've heard  And I've had 
[02:13:30]  Some success with it  But like I said  There's no guarantee  On that  Dr. D  You rock  I'll give it a try  This afternoon  All right  Thank you buddy  Let's go to Joe  In New Jersey  Joe what's up  How you doing guys  All right  Chris Martin  From Coldplay  Is such a fucking hypocrite  He has those  Fair trade signs  All over his hands  And his concerts  And everything  And he squeezes  Every penny out of  Everybody for his CDs  And didn't Coldplay  Do like a commercial  For iTunes  You know maybe  It was just me  I could not get  The Coldplay CD  On my iTunes 
[02:14:00]  And it really  Pissed me off yesterday  All right  Thank you  One more  There are some  Just racist people  I can't even  I cannot even  Read these  Brian in Philly  What's up man  Hey  He's got a different  Line for  Henry listen to  The loons  It ain't loons  God damn comedian  I know  It's funny  That he called him  Henry too  And his name is  Norman  Stupid listener 
[02:14:30]  Norman and Ethel  Henry Fonda  You idiot  Sounds like  I'm listening  Brian in Philly  What's up Brian  What's up guys  That guy  But I just want  To let you know  That yeah  The shift key  Does work  And mainly  The RCA albums  The record label  RCA has it  So Velvet Revolver  Foo Fighters  Casbian  They're the ones  Trying this whole  You know  Protection thing  So that's why  It definitely works  And as for the  Whole Mac thing  I'm not sure  But when you  Download stuff  Of iTunes  You can't play  It anywhere else 
[02:15:00]  But iTunes  And an iPod  So  Yeah it's getting  Ridiculous  That whole thing  You know  But there are ways  Around it  You know  You just gotta  Kind of know  What you're doing  It sucks for those  Who don't really  Have a clue  Because you know  Right  You can't listen  To music  Alright thanks buddy  Thanks guys  I just want to know  Why my iTunes  Won't play on my thing  Because I've kind of  Really gotten into it  And it's like  My iPod  I love it  I just want to know  Why  It starts to sound  Like it's like  A spool of film  Running out  Running through my music  And I pause it  And then like  It almost jumps  The actual iPod 
[02:15:30]  When you're  No no no  The actual iTunes  On the computer  Oh wow  I have no idea  On that one  Drives me batty  Pardon my French  Oh easy  Alright well  So Batman  We liked Batman  And the fight sequences  A bunch of people  Said they like it that way  Yeah  It seems a little  I don't know  A little busy  You kind of don't  Have to  You don't see things  Like you know  Film flubs  Or bad punches  Or something  That looks fake  When it's like that  Which is kind of good  But you don't really  See much of anything  As far as the fight goes  You know what  Really pissed me off though 
[02:16:00]  Might spoil the movie  For somebody out there  So I'll wait a second  Even though  If you know  The story of Batman  I'm not really  Getting crazy here  Yeah  You think they  Changed the channel  By now  I'm trying to be  A nice guy  I'm trying to be  A nice guy  I didn't see it  It might be a spoiler  But everyone knows  That the whole Batman  You know  Character  His parents die  Right  Yeah  Yeah everyone knows  That's kind of  All right  So  Because I don't  I don't feel like  Being a dick today  Anyway  Well they die  In the movie  Or is it like  Before when he 
[02:16:30]  Was Batman  They set it up  You know  Him as a kid  And it's how  The movie starts  It's not like  Oh my god  You just wrecked  A movie for me  Obviously he had  To have some  Kind of conflict  That made him  Turn into this  Stupid bat thing  Right  So he's at  The death scene  Whatever  They're at the opera  Yeah  And all of a sudden  Like  The person that's  Going to become  Batman as a kid  There  He needs to leave  The theater  Whatever  Because he's all  Freaked out about  Some shit  And all of a sudden  The parents who are  Like multi-billionaires  Pretty much run Gotham  Yeah  Walk out a side door 
[02:17:00]  At the opera house  Into an alley  Where you know  The bad guy's waiting  Yeah  It's like  Stop  They would have  Security  Wouldn't walk out  The back door  Like that  It's like  You know  Yeah  They would have  Security  Of course  A driver  All sorts of stuff  Why wouldn't they  Leave out the front door  But no  Conveniently  Because it helps  I guess  They leave out  A side door  Or back door  Into an alley  Where there's no  Good going on  And wouldn't that  Microwave emitter  Thing boil your blood  Like wouldn't it 
[02:17:30]  Just boil all the  Liquid  Like  All the water  In your bloodstream  Oh good point  Good point  Yeah  Alright I got you  By the way  What color was the burglar  What color was the crook  I bet he was white  Of course he was white  Well yeah  Of course he was white  You know that  Because the whites  Do all the crime  In the movies  In the movies anyway  Yeah  They turned audio off  In producer studio  I didn't ruin the movie  Oh  But I just thought 
[02:18:00]  That was  It took  You know  It was just  Kind of stupid  Yeah it wasn't  Well I got a little  Skeeter bite  Nothing to worry about though  Are you itching?  Yeah you know  What grandma taught me  When I was a boy  You put toothpaste  On a mosquito bite  And be darned  If it doesn't take  The itch away  Looks silly  Little  Really  Little toothpaste  All over you  What are you  Brushing your elbow  Get out of here you  That is silly indeed  I got a little  Mosquito bite  While I was away  At home  Remedy shit  No but it works though  Grandma was right  Somewhere there's a little  Mosquito flying around 
[02:18:30]  With a bathrobe on  Slippers  Little mosquito friends  Visiting him  You're not dying  Skeet  You're killing  Everyone around you  Remember when  Remember when  It came out for a while  That they weren't sure  That mosquitoes  You know  Could you know  Carry the AIDS  Oh my god  Remember the panic  Everyone felt  Absolutely  Oh yeah  Mosquito's been guilty  Of carrying around  Diseases for quite some time  That god damn 
[02:19:00]  Equine  Encephalitis  Virus thing  Malaria  That's like  Yeah malaria  I remember as a kid  They called it  Around Long Island  They called it  The sleeping sickness  Jesus  And you got it  You got it from  The mosquito  Would sting a horse  With the disease  Equine encephalitis  And then sting you  Suck your blood out there  And you would get it  You would get the  Sleeping sickness  You go to sleep  And never wake up  And it was the creepy  As a kid  You're just  A mosquito  You'd be freaking out 
[02:19:30]  You want a blowjob  That home remedy crap  They always have one of those  Quacks on the morning TV  Well peanut butter is good for  Shut up  I'll tell you one thing  Toothpaste  Nana was right  Nana was right  Works really well  On a skater bite  Now I don't have any here  But I'll tell you  It takes a little  It's right away  You got any  Give him some  Oh  Wow  Wow

[02:20:30]  Yeah  Look at him  He's putting a little  Colgate on his  Skeeter bite  Just a touch  Isn't that going to burn  No  No  I'm not putting it in my pee hole  You want to  You bet I do  You want to put it in mine  Yeah  Then I'll brush my teeth with it  It's not gay  If it's for oral hygiene  Enough of this Mitch Beck ass 
[02:21:00]  Done with him  Done with him  Well then  Shut your trap next time  And really  I believe you're just an apology  And realize who you're dealing with  Who you're dealing with  I believe an apology is in order  Buster  That's right  I may call him  Buster  Must be a great comedian  It's not a big  So anyway  Batman Begins  He tapes of him  Anyone out there  Knows if he taped anything  If we could get actual tapes  Of his stand up  How funny would that be  Hey um 
[02:21:30]  Please God  Let there be a tape of him  Floating around  Bombing horribly  At some function  Is there any way to find out  Is there any way to find out  How much money the honeymooners made  Because this is the second weekend out  I'm just obsessed with that  The movie failing  I bet there was a drop off in revenue  Well they never really  Opening week  They had a horrendous first week  After all that marketing  And advertising  Oh by the way  I got a nasty email  About comments I made  About Roger Ebert  About him liking black films 
[02:22:00]  A little bit more  Some guy's like  Why don't you get him on the air  And get your facts straight  And it's like  Look whoever wrote that  We've tried to get him on the air  But he's not responding  We always try to get people on the air  To defend themselves  And when Richard Huff  Was on the air  We don't just yell and scream  And over talk people  People get their say  You're welcome to come on  And say what you want to say  If you have a problem  Of course  Good news  In the second week of release  The honeymooners made  2.6 million dollars  For a grand total of 9.5  Oh wow  That is a disaster  9.5 million  Yeah  But it'll do well at Blockbuster 
[02:22:30]  Yikes  You know what though  The public is just out and out  Rejecting it  Because there's  And again  It's annoying  Because when you look at Friday  Or other stuff that EPSA's done  Or stuff that Cedric has done  They're hugely successful guys  It's like why  You don't need to do that  You know when we were talking about  They're both big draws  You know when we were talking about  Remakes and saying how  Remakes in general  Just blow and all that  I saw the movie poster  For the Bad News Bears  With Billy Bob Thornton  Yeah  I think that has potential  Really?  It just seems like it could work  As long as they do  Like the whole Bad Santa thing 
[02:23:00]  As long as they get nude  Yeah  As long as Tanner Boyle  Has washboard ads  Like the original kid  They better get a cute Tanner  If I can't jerk off to Tanner  I don't watch the movie  That's what I say  Hey Yankees  But they do have a kid  In a wheelchair  So who knows  I like that  But we'll see where that goes  I think  I do on a Little League team  I think the catcher  Is in a wheelchair  Or something  Stop it  Instead of having the fat kid  Behind home plate  That's fine  I think it's going to be  A kid in a wheelchair  Is a kid with Pejoria 
[02:23:30]  Playing lupus  The little boy  Wow  I'm going to play the adfield  At the Pejoria  I'm just a regular kid  It is  It's a kid in a wheelchair  I'm just a regular fella  I do like what regular kids do all the time  I just like to sit here  Play checkers  Age  Crickets  Kind of funny  I hear you like to skateboard  Just like a little kid  Why don't you get your skateboard  Bring it out here  You want to see him skateboard everybody 
[02:24:00]  Yeah  Okay  I want one person  To just stand up  When that happens  Because they always ask  That dumb question  And go  For the love of God  No  No  Let him skateboard  I'll hop up on the skateboard  With my spaghetti legs  And let's see what I can break  Oh body of a 90 year old man  He's still a kid  You get him skateboarding  To prove that he's just like everybody else  He's not just like everybody else  Yeah great  It's an alien skateboarding  Stop with the progeria kids 
[02:24:30]  Maury  What Maury should say  Is anybody else want to see him in a tube  In the dumpster of a Planned Parenthood  You bet we do  And this by the way  I'm looking at the poster  Why would they remake this movie  It's almost like with Matthau  And it was such a good movie  The first time  It's only like 30 years old  There's no need to remake it  I'm with you  But I don't know  There's something about  A lot of remakes going on  But Bad Santa was great  And that was original  That's why  Just do another one like that 
[02:25:00]  You don't need to remake an old film  I'm with you  But I don't know  There's something about this movie  That looks like it could be good  If they go all out  If they go out  Don't make it PC  They do show him drinking  So  Yeah  Oh  A little deodorant  A little  A little antiperspirant  Rekguard cool spray  Billy Bob at least  I don't think will be  Politically correct with it though  I mean that's one thing about him  Is he seems to like  You know  He doesn't mind  Telling kids to fuck off  Yeah  Great  This summer  Paramount Pictures presents  The Bad News Peers 
[02:25:30]  I hate the trailers  I got into Batman  Like right when the movie started  It was so late  Getting there  And the movie had just started  And I was like 15 minutes late  Dude  It had to be a half hour  It had to be  Because now it's not just  Commercial previews  Yeah trailers  Now you gotta sit through  So many commercials first  I guess what  They're starting a new trend  Where they're gonna show you  In the paper  When the movie  Actually starts  But that's gonna confuse  The hell out of everyone  Because the movie listings  You're not gonna know  They're gonna have a time 
[02:26:00]  What does that mean  When you're supposed to be  You know what kind of sucks though  It's gonna be people  Coming in now  When the movie's already starting  And they're gonna be  Sitting down  But see I've been  Walking around in front of you  I've been doing that  That gag for  Whatever you wanna call it  For years  Where you know  You've figured out the previews  Unless it's summer preview season  You know the previews  Gonna be really good  But in general  The previews are like whatever  So for years  I've been going late  But the problem is  With a movie like  Batman Begins  You know  You gotta get there early  To get a good seat  So now you're stuck  Watching all the crap  I don't mind the trailers 
[02:26:30]  But the goddamn commercials  Oof  Stay home and see those  They are awful  Treatment and doing some soul search  Oh what do you got  Katie got a chance  To sit down with Jennifer  Oh big eyes  And her fiance  For an exclusive interview  And you can see more  Of that interview tomorrow  On today  And tomorrow night  In a Katie Kirk  Primetime special  At 8, 7 central  What a Google eyed creep  She really looks like Alex  In Clockwork Orange  She should be having  A doctor put eye drops in  While she watches a rape on film  Creepy eyed whore  We're taping that right  I was teabagged 
[02:27:00]  By a Mexican  What a bad liar  She got like  A half a million dollars  For a book deal  A movie deal  Yeah yeah  A movie deal  And she's like  Oh I never talked  Oh sorry  Damn it  That was his own kid  Sorry  It was somebody  On a swing  No it was James Taylor  And it was his grandchild  Swinging with him  He's a grandpa  I swing  I stand corrected  That's really hot  Good point Oof  Good point  All right  Oh well  The horrid man  That's why I'm here 
[02:27:30]  Hey James Taylor  Play the straight man  There you go  Good point  All right  So there you go  Batman was whatever  Was whatever  That's the review  Yeah  Nah it was really good  On that DVD I have  There's also a Siskel  And Ebert  Outtakes  And they just  Hated each other  They hated each other  They're doing promos  For the show  It's like  This week  At the movies  Check out  They say whatever movie  Robocop  It's whatever it was  Back then  And then they stop  And Ebert is just  Calling Siskel  A mush mouth 
[02:28:00]  Because he can't talk  It's probably like  The tumor  Just starting up  In his head  But he can't talk  And then Siskel  Starts bashing Ebert  About how fat he is  And they're not kidding  They're like  Throwing the F word  Around all the time  Really  Yeah they hate each other  We play that  I would think we could  Certainly  Where is it  It's on the DVD  At my house  I'm bringing it in tomorrow  You have a lot of  Good stuff there Ant  I'm bringing it in tomorrow  Ben email Anthony  Again  Outtakes  That's why I said again  I got the email  But I don't know  Ben  Can I read this on the air 
[02:28:30]  Can I Ben  All right  Ben Sparks  Please bring in  There you go  Well I didn't like that movie  Well you're such an asshole  And by the way  Get that oatmeal  Out of your ear  All right  We're going to talk  About the cop killer  Video game  We're going to talk  About  Yeah this looks good  Tom Cruise  Shooting  While getting shot  In the eye  By a water gun  Might want to  Maybe we'll talk  About  Ugly George  Returning  Ugly George  Remember him from 
[02:29:00]  I don't remember him though  You really don't  All right  We're going to talk  Ugly George as well  And blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  Blah blah  Like sands  Through the hourglass  So is the ONA virus  Can we stop  With the roadside memorials  The depressing  Friggin roadside memorials  Yeah highways  Do we need to be  Reminded of our mortality  As we're driving  Down the road  By seeing some  Impromptu grave  On the side of the road  Highways are depressing  To begin with  Oh my god 
[02:29:30]  Unless you're driving  From I don't know  Like LA to San Francisco  You know  Beautiful coastline drive  Or something  That's what I want  It's pretty depressing  To begin with  And you've got to see that  I want to cross  The side that Christ  Dragged through the street  On the side of a pole  With stuffed animals  So I know children  Were involved  No flowers  Like hey  You start looking  You can build the whole story  In your head  What happened  Alright it was a minivan  Six children on board  Right  All dead  God that is funny  I don't want to see them  Well it used to be that 
[02:30:00]  It was just every once in a while  You see one  It's like oh that was  Kind of a nice gesture  Then eh eh  You don't think about it  But you're so right  It's every highway  It's almost every mile  It's not a friggin Learjet  That plowed into the ground  They couldn't find a body for  That you need a rock there  With their names on it  I'm sure  You had an accident  There's a grave somewhere  Put flowers there  Leave our highways alone  And who's stopping  Sitting in the shoulder  And opening the trunk  And taking a stuffed animal out  And putting it on the shoulder  Putting it there  Putting the cross up  It's always right next to that tree  With the big gouge taken out of it 
[02:30:30]  Enough  Right  Enough  If I see a tree  With a big bite taken out of it  I'll assume it wasn't a brontosaurus  I'll assume a car smashed into it  And there may have been  A few bathers were injured  But there may have been  Some injuries involved  See I'll actually get out  And take some of those stuffed animals  And then just give  I'll usually give them to my nephew  Happy birthday Nick  Happy birthday little guy  Why is it wet?  Was someone crying on it?  I don't know  Opie and Anthony 
[02:31:00]  The virus is spreading  Still lots to do today  We have the Chuck Schumer stuff  I forgot about that too  Huh?  Yeah  Another video game coming out  That looks action packed  And of course  Very controversial 
[02:31:30]  A lot of gunplay involved  And I guess there's some police officers  Being shot at in the game  Schumer's got a problem  He tackles all the tough issues  Chuck Schumer  He certainly does  Video games  Video games and cousin Brucie  Way to have your finger on the pulse  Stupid  People are not influenced  By music  Movies  And video games  Can we stop?  It's amazing  Can we stop?  That's enough  That's enough 
[02:32:00]  Maybe the fact he should  He should be concerned  The fact that most of his voting block  Is having children out of wedlock  Why don't you address that Charles?  I shot a man in Reno  Just to watch him die  Oh  Thank you  Johnny Cash  Thank you  Yeah  Just to watch him die  Falsom County  Falsom Prison  Falsom Prison Blues  Right  Ben send me an email  To bring in my book  In other words please 
[02:32:30]  Thank you  Ben has to be our reminders  That's right  Reading a good book on interviews  One of these guys that did a lot of the Rolling Stone interviews  And I was telling you the other day  About the Paul McCartney yesterday thing  Yep  And  Stupid Yoko  Stupid Yoko  I'll get into that tomorrow  Because I highlighted some great passages from the book  And then Johnny Cash  Talking about how  How he doesn't believe that movies  And music and all that influence  The kids of today  Yeah  And that lyrics 
[02:33:00]  Especially in music  Have been really bad  Ever since we started singing songs  Anthony  That's right  And a lot of people do point out  His example  That he has this song  You know  I shot a man in Reno  Just to watch him die  So  We'll get into that a little more tomorrow  But  Video games Anthony  Yeah  I mean you know  We're friends with a lot of cops  So  Personally  It kind of pisses me off  When I read something like this  A little bit  I know a lot of cops  That play these games though  But you think the cops are playing these games  I think the cops understand  That this is  You know  This is it 
[02:33:30]  This is  Politicians  With an agenda  Against  You know  Gaming  To try to get people on their side  Parents and stuff  So they will vote for them  They don't care  Oh okay  I was ready to yell  I was ready to yell  Wrong  Yeah  Because they don't really care  They just want people to vote for them  Yeah they don't care  That there's violent video games out there  They jump on these topics  Because they know  It gets their name out there  And then when the election time  Comes around  Chuck Schumer  Can put out a commercial  That goes  Chuck Schumer  Was against video games  That depicted 
[02:34:00]  Killing of police officers  Chuck Schumer  Is a publicity  Whore  Yeah  I don't even know  He's what  A senator  He's one of our great senators  From the state of New York  I know he walks around  Him and Hillary  I know he has  People walk around with him  With huge signs  That just read  Do you want to meet  Chuck Schumer  And he's in the middle of the signs  Looking ridiculous  Ridiculous  He's a publicity whore  A publicity seeking whore  Cop killer video game  Sick  Chuck  No different than GTA 
[02:34:30]  In GTA  You're running around  You're shooting  Everything  The people on the streets  Old ladies  You beat him over the head  You're shooting cops  You're doing  It's part of the game  It's a gaming experience  It's a way to  Play the criminal element  In a game  You know why?  Because you're not one  In real life  And nor would you be one  In real life  You just  Kind of  Put yourself into this game  And you play it  Because it's fun  I believe 
[02:35:00]  And it's fake  I believe it goes  The other way too  It's a stress reliever  There you go  This life is filled  With a lot of stress  And these are the ways  To just relieve a little  Of that stress  It's fun  But you know what?  I have to back up  Because I'm saying  We're not influenced  By video games  And then you have to  Mention Grand Theft Auto  I have problems  When I'm driving sometimes  I'm convinced you  You can go through  Every red light now  Do you?  I swear to God  You start  But do you?  No  But there's something  Going on in my brain  Where oh yeah  I gotta stop  Like there is  A thought process now  In the past 
[02:35:30]  You see red  You just instantly  Well you go through it  If it just turned red  But uh  Or you're  You know  Oh alright  Yeah I gotta stop  But now  And then when I see  Pedestrians crossing the street  I'm like  Ah!  You can run them over  I want to on a daily basis  And that has nothing  To do with the game  Believe me  That has nothing  To do with a video game  That has to do with  Driving around in Manhattan  You just want to kill pedestrians  We did talk about this  Back in the day  When I was into  The Tomb Raider games  For a while there  Uh huh  I know I'm dating myself  A bit I guess  But uh  You was into Pong?  I know  But it gets to a point 
[02:36:00]  Like Tomb Raider  You know I started looking  At the buildings in Manhattan  A lot differently  Remember this conversation  We had  And it's the truth though  You start going  Hey I could get up there  Yeah certain games  Kind of  And then I think  If I do a back flip  I could get to that ledge  Over there  You just start looking  Around your surroundings  A little differently  When you get into  You know heavy  Into these video games  It has nothing to do  With um  With it affecting you though  Like you're going to do  Horrible things  Yeah you play the game  You enjoy it  You look around 
[02:36:30]  Your surroundings  And you know  Incorporate it into a game  Sometimes like that  But not  You know  Wow I played this game  So let me get a gun now  And start shooting cops  It's not what it's about  That's a big step right  It's entertainment  It's rated by the way  It's not supposed to be sold  To children under a certain age  When it comes out  That old gang  No stop  I know  But Chuck Schumer  Very mad  The game is 25 to life  Going to be released  In September  And it looks pretty cool 
[02:37:00]  Real gangster  You know  Apparently you're  A gang member  I guess you got to  Work your way up  In the gang  By doing all kinds  Of fun stuff  I guess theft  And murder  But it's a game  And then this guy  Staten Island DA  Daniel Donovan  Pointing out that  Some defense lawyers  Are now using  Violent video games  As an alibi  For clients  Who want to commit  Violent crimes  But he says  This is not a game  But a teaching tool  To being a criminal  Believe me 
[02:37:30]  Because lawyers  Are using video games  As a defense  And an alibi  Doesn't mean  That that's true  You ass  Daniel Donovan  Doesn't mean  That it's because  The video game  Is bad  They're doing it  To try to get  Their client off the hook  Using any excuse  They can  Like video games  You know  Chuck Schumer  I'm sure he's a smart man  He doesn't give a fuck  He's trying to get his name  In the press again today  Because  You know  I didn't even know  This game was out there  I didn't either 
[02:38:00]  And now  You know what  I'm like  I'm thinking of going  Running down  To one of these  You know  Video stores there  And picking up a copy  Well in September  Oh it's not even out yet  Oh this is great  I just said that  Opie  I'm sorry  I'll hear that  In the replay  Dude he's just  A publicity whore  That's what he does  Here we go again  Yeah September  It's coming out  There were a couple  Of things that happened  Earlier too  Anthony  Oh I know  Believe me  I listened to the replay  I go oof  Yeah video games 
[02:38:30]  Rang up 10 billion dollars  In sales last year  And how many crimes  Can they  Attribute to  You know  Video games  None  Sorry  None  You're not going to tell me  Anyone's committing crimes  Because of the video game  Not because they're nuts  And they would have  Done something anyway  And they just happen  To enjoy playing this game  And then go out  And kill people  I'm sure that's happened  This is not a game  But a teaching tool  To being a criminal  Like you said  It's not  And then here's  Chuck Schumer's 
[02:39:00]  Quote of the day  We should have a sounder  Quote of the day  Everyone prepare themselves  With their laugh buttons  Chuck Schumer says  25 to life  Makes Grand Theft Auto  Look like Romper Robe  That's terrific  That's terrific  Enough with the comparison quotes 
[02:39:30]  Please people  Can I say that  Chuck Schumer  Makes Mitch Beck  Look like Richard Pryor  I know  That's funny  Just when I said  Enough with the comparison quotes  You come up with a good one  Got it  Do you think  Chuck Schumer  Ever played  Grand Theft Auto  Do you think  Chuck Schumer  Ever sat down  And played  Grand Theft Auto 
[02:40:00]  Ever  I don't know  I don't think so  Way to use a topical show  Stupid  Romper Room  I know  Yeah  Makes it seem like  Green Acres  Jesus Chuck  Let's go to  Chuck Schumer  Clips  We got those  Ready to go  Yeah  Alright  We going with Derek  Or we going with  You got him  Alright here's a Chuck Schumer  Quote  We are asking  Microsoft  And Sony  The makers of  Playstation and Xbox  Not to sign  Licensing agreements 
[02:40:30]  With the evil company  That's over in the  British Isles  That put out this game  Evil company  In the British Isles  Oof  The evil company  Yes  Dr. Evil  Alright let's hear  The next quote  Evil company  The bottom line is  That games  That are aimed  And marketed  At kids  And teach them  Violence  And desensitize them  To death and destruction  Have no place 
[02:41:00]  In our society  It's not aimed  At kids  You asshole  I love these games  I play them  A lot  Why should an adult  Be denied  Some entertainment  A fun game  Like this  Why should  Adult speed  Deny this  Because people  Think that it's  Going to harm  The children  Again  We're living  In this  Hablum society  Now with  Everything being  Dull  And unexciting  And uneventful  Because it might  Affect the children  So he uses 
[02:41:30]  That excuse  Marketed  At children  It is not  Shut up  It's marketed  At people  That enjoy  Playing video games  How about this  Why don't you  Start protesting  Alcohol  And saying  That shouldn't  Be sold  Because that is  What teaches  Kids violence  And their father  Drinks a fifth  Of it  And punches  Their mother  In the stomach  And in the face  Why don't you  Fight that  Because that's  Real life  You know  They'd rather  Look at things  Like music  And these vague  Things  Video games  Fake stuff  It goes for  The easy targets  Why don't you  Go take on  The alcohol  Companies there  Right  Go ahead  Chuck 
[02:42:00]  If you really  Care about people  The drunk driving  Deaths add up  You want to add up  Drunk driving deaths  Or you want to add up  Video game crimes  You want to see  What amounts to more  Let's see  He'd be more upset  With a game  That depicts  A drunk driver  Running people over  Right  Than real life  People being run over  And the argument  Would be  Well alcohol  Is a social lubricant  Most people  Use it  Responsibly  Responsibly  Well it's the same  Thing with this  Most people  Use these video games  Responsibly  Yeah  What is this  A clip  An Asian guy  Getting off a train  Black guy grabs him  By the throat  Uses him as a shield 
[02:42:30]  Human shield  That was a big gun fight  In a subway station  With undercoder  Cops  Little machine guns  Tech nines  Shotguns  Slow-mo bullet time  Wow  That's great  Graphics look really cool  Stop it  Flipping the bird  Out the train  Big tattooed arm  Those are great graphics  Man  This is  That looks great  Looks like a lot of fun  Come on  That's what you want  Gunplay in a subway  That's a great game  Who do you play  The police or the thugs 
[02:43:00]  The thugs  Family of the thugs  What  Can you play either  See that's smart  By the company  By the way  There you go  Very smart guy  Why do they call it  A police training video  Game  Very smart  Anthony we gotta go  This is always a hot topic  On the O&A show  Let's go to John in Virginia  John what's up  Hey guys  I'm in trouble right now  For mistreating a gorilla  After playing Donkey Kong  Were you the guy  I read about you  You were like  He was throwing barrels  Down at you  That bastard pissed me off  Just because I was Italian 
[02:43:30]  He's mad at me  Very good  Very good  I love the violent video games  What else are you gonna play  Dude the graphics  That good  That's how out of touch  I am  I just saw them  That's fair  I wanna get that  That looked like a cutscene  You know  They put those in  That was a cutscene  To promote the game  What do you mean a cutscene  In-game graphics  Are probably very good  But probably not that good  Okay  That's just like  We're not at that  They make a little movie  Using a computer  Like that  But it's not the in-game graphics 
[02:44:00]  We try to trick you like that  Do they look like the  The Spaceman  In the original Atari  Like those things  Yeah that's when you get  A square bullet flying off  Awful  Square head  Square arms  Square body  Wait what comedian  Does the funny joke  About how video games  Used to be  The comic is taught  Is caught talking about  That you really should  Have your microphone hand  Just severed  Hack  Remember when we were kids  Let's play the 
[02:44:30]  The final clip  From Chuck Schumer  The bottom line is  That little Johnny  Should be learning  How to read  Not how to kill  Police officers  Oh my god  Shut up  I hate Chuck Schumer  I think little Tyrone  Is the example you meant  Stupid  Oh wow  Chuck Schumer  Oh what a  What an irrelevant boob he is 
[02:45:00]  Just you cliches  Throwing out those  Politician cliches  Little Johnny  Needs to learn  How to read  And  Ugh  Not killing cops  It's not an educational tool  Jerk off  Maybe little Johnny  Could learn how to write  Original thoughts and speeches  And stop boring everybody  With trite  Hack  Points of view  Yeah  Let's go to  Way  Wayland  Wayland in Georgia  Yes sir  Hey  Doing alright this morning  Alright we're doing alright  Chuck needs to go  Fraudder 
[02:45:30]  Literally  Damn it  You know your phone  Crapped out  And it was the word  That was going to make  Your bid a lot better  Basically he said  Chuck should go play  Real life Frogger  Thank you  Alright sorry buddy  Video games  Little Johnny  I'm waiting for the Godfather  To come out  That's a game  That's coming out soon  Yeah actually  And they actually taped  Some voice of  Marlon Brando  Before he died  He sure  For the game  Yeah  And he put in  Cotton in his cheeks  And actually did the voice 
[02:46:00]  For this game  That's coming out  You know how much money  He must have gotten for that  I know  James Kahn  Is doing voices in it  A couple other people  Did they get Pacino  Or did they get  I don't think they got Pacino  Or Duvall  Yeah they got Duvall  Yeah  Wow  They got Frank Caliendo  Playing Pacino  Dude I gotta tell you  Marlon Brando  They're auctioning off  His stuff too  Yeah  You see that in the paper  Christie's  I'm tempted to go  And get the license  You want  Dude I love Brando  I would love to  I can't afford  Most of the stuff  But the license  Is like 500 bucks  That's a lot of money  I've never spent 
[02:46:30]  Any kind of money  Like that on  I'll probably go for  Imagine that  Hanging up on your wall  His driver's license  Yeah  It'll probably go for  A lot more  It's gonna go way  More than 500  All that stuff  Yeah  You won't be able  To touch any of that stuff  But I'm just saying  500's in a realm  Where I can kind of  Comprehend like  Alright  Little auction paddle  You start beating  Your ass with it  Yeah  Spanking the gallon  For me  What do you  Can you wear  Sabbath shirt to Christie's  Or do you have to  Dress up  I don't know  Do you  I think as long  As you're  Spending money  What do you do  I've never been to an auction  I think you gotta  Dress up nice 
[02:47:00]  I've never been to an auction  I'd love to go to an auction  Turn around  Now he can probably lift  I would like to go to one  Let's see his teeth  I was talking about  A horse auction  I went to  Out in Chino, California  When I was out there  Jesus Jimmy  I knew he was talking about horses  What's wrong with you  I think it's hilarious  I love horse jokes  Yeah  One of my  My first horse  That I got  Called Nightmare  Beautiful horse 
[02:47:30]  And it was at an auction  Were you riding Nightmare  When you met Dreamweaver  Yeah  It was my horse  Nightmare  Black as the ace of spades  That horse  Nice shiny black coat  Came out  The auctioneer starts going  Hey  $150  I think I bought  Bought it for  What  $250  I bet you  You only got to ride it  Once a week  Very  It was a wonderful  I rode that horse 
[02:48:00]  A lot  It was wonderful  It was a kind of  Nice experience too  Going there  With dad  Going to the horse auction  Picking out your horse  That you want  A horse  A horse  Cook  Here we go again  The son  Is attempting to bring  An outside mare  Into this  Situation  You like  Oats  Dog  Alright  I get it  I get it  Here we go  Cue music  I wouldn't hurt 
[02:48:30]  One hair  On his god damn  Tail  I'm not  Gonna hurt you  Wendy  I'm not  Gonna hurt you  I'm just  Gonna feed you  Some sugar juice  I'm just  Gonna cut your head  Off  And put it  In waltz's bed  And when  Do you think  Danny ought to  Go to the  Veterinarian  I've often 
[02:49:00]  Wondered  These things  My whole life  Have made me laugh  These raging bull  Me and my friend  Lou would do this  When we were  14 and 15  It's like  Do these make  Anybody laugh  I honestly  Don't know  And more importantly  I don't care  It's irrelevant  I've wondered that  Though  Because I howl  With this stuff  I love it  That's all that counts  You're not touching  His driver's license  David the trucker  Go ahead  Yeah I wanted to tell  Jimmy that  Marilyn Monroe's  Driver's license  Went at auction  For $175,000  Well dude 
[02:49:30]  The difference is this  Brando  Brando probably  Had more licenses  Than she did  So it's not  As rare an item  Oh very good  And also  This is starting  At $500  So they usually  Have a fairly  Good estimate  Sometimes they're  Way off  But I guarantee  Monroe's license  Wasn't guessed  At $500  And went for that  Alright  Let's say hi  To Ron  In Pennsylvania  Ron what's up  Hey  When are people  Going to learn  That you know  Video games  Aren't for kids  It might have been  That way back 
[02:50:00]  In the old days  But now  We've all grown up  And we all want  To play games  Right  We're still playing  Why do these people  Insist on thinking  That only kids  Buy video games  I mean  You don't  Buy your kids  Porno  And they have  Ratings  And the games  Ratings  On them too  Yeah well  At $50 a pop  Too for a lot  Of these games  What kid  Is going out  And spending  $50 of his  Own money  On these  I mean kids  That are really  Impressionable  About this  And the kids  Like little  Johnny  That Chuck  Schumer's  Talking about  He ain't  Pulling $50 
[02:50:30]  Out to buy  A video game  And where  Are the parents  I know  It's an  Oh that's  In game  Where are the  Parents  It's an obvious  It's an obvious  Argument but  You got to know  What your kids  Can handle  Right  Where are the  Parents taking a  Peek to make  Sure little  Johnny  Little Johnny  Can handle his  Video games  Learning to read  And write  You always bring up  That great point  About how we  Have to suffer  Because  Adults  We have to  Suffer  And by adults  I mean adults  That still enjoy  Things in life  Still enjoy  Having a little  Fun 
[02:51:00]  Haven't given  Up on life  Why is it  That anything  That's fun  For us  Has to be  Looked at  As detrimental  To children  And because of  That now  It's got to  Be taken away  You can't  Watch it  The TV show  Sorry  A little too  Entertaining  Might hurt the  Children  So now we  Can't play  Video games  They want this  Game off the  Market  They don't  Want it coming  Out at all  Why  Why can't an  Adult  In a free  God damn  Nation  Pick this game  Up and play it  There's a good  Friend of mine

[02:56:00]  better but remember that kid took a puck on the forehead damn and died yeah tragic story behind the  goal or whatever tragic well because of that now they have uh you know put up netting behind all the  goals yeah in all the arena so if you're sitting behind the goal a little higher up  you have to watch the whole game through this really obnoxious netting because that's there  to protect you i'm just surprised more people have been killed it happened one time yeah and they  probably paid through the nose you know if it happens once twice i hate to say it but why ruin it 
[02:56:30]  for everyone else you got to just kind of sit back and go ah sucks to be ill what's your life in your  hand when you go to but it's like it you know it's it's not like it's happening every game or  anything it's true some of this stuff will happen isn't once enough though no what's happening every  game how great would that be see some tot taking out with a hockey puck in his forehead you tell  me you wouldn't go sign up for that i'd go to every hockey game that i could get my stupid little fat  hands on pat uh from monarchy is talking about a horse he said uh my horse got hurt don't worry

[02:58:30]  tell uh tell you anything all right tom cruise anthony story of the day soak joke leaves tom washed up  most people have seen the video at this point i do believe this guy really wanted this to go  differently he wanted i guess he had a camera crew with him and uh he had a microphone and he was  conducting this interview yeah it's the premiere of uh war of the worlds yeah and that preview looked  great by the way yeah it looks like it's gonna be a great movie and as tom cruise is talking he squirts 
[02:59:00]  him with his microphone water gun that's awesome and it gets uh tom cruise in the face now i guess this  guy was expecting to get a good reaction out of tom that would have been funny or something  but tom cruise kind of wiped his face off and then just gives this guy a talking to well he seemed like  he was gonna laugh at first like oh and then he just realized i don't know who to side with on this  one like i think the guy is kind of funny for doing like it's harmless wow i haven't seen this i  haven't seen the video of him actually getting squirt yet here go back him over it looks like he's 
[02:59:30]  ready to laugh at first watch yeah he starts laughing and then goes what the fuck did you  just do he's got a little towel to wipe himself off with here just uh close that up and start up  again he's just he's just giving this guy watch here it is because i haven't seen this it was a  face dressing him down it was a face full of liquid was it make your own jokes people wow um  the hell's that a come i hate commercials there's god damn commercials on video sites 
[03:00:00]  to the news channels here we go caught on tape here's a young go-getter doing the news for  everybody yeah i'm hoping to make it to new york some oh oh wow  why did you do that he did kind of laugh like oh gee oh he grabs his hand because he doesn't want  him going anywhere he wants to give him a talking to he laughed at first though that could have been  like fucking acid yeah it was in the water dude it sprayed hydrochloric acid on his face uh and the 
[03:00:30]  guy's part of a show that plays pranks on celebrities it's not like he was trying to hurt him oh really  that's what it says here he's part of a new show who plays pranks on celebrities ah i invented that  and it was like tom right he could have probably come off why like tom cruise has been running  around jumping up and down on couches making an ass out of himself uh-huh come on man the guy just  squirred you a little water it's like you threw a bucket of pig's blood in your face oh he was with  uh katie holmes was the creepy scientologist lady there too yeah that's been following katie holmes 
[03:01:00]  yeah every making sure she doesn't uh escape why would you do that why would you do you have the  audio that's what he said he's like yeah well i think we got some of the oh let's hear uh really fast i  think we i don't know if we talked about it a lot last week but there's a huge rumor in hollywood  that a lot of people are taking pretty seriously that there's uh there was an audition to be tom  cruise's girlfriend stop and they actually talked to other actresses really it was a blind item in 
[03:01:30]  the post but then i guess a lot of the other papers picked it up as well an audition like you  you could audition to be you know tom cruise's latest uh chick there must it what you think you  have to sign a confidentiality thing to even go on the audition like if you if you show up for this  you have to sign something that says you'll never talk about it you'll never write about  there has to be otherwise i don't know man something's going on there and i don't think  it's love only because it's so my only question would be because it happens so fast and it's so  perfect and it's so publicity perfect yeah that's what kind of bugs me about it they arrested these 
[03:02:00]  guys for doing that it's some sort of an assault assault all right well here's the audio let's see  what we got here  okay uh you hear him go ahead because he was talking about it the pro the movie first going  yeah he bought a lot he actually was leading up to it and then he kind of chuckled yeah why would  you do that and then we got another clip that's incredibly rude i'm here giving you an interview  and answering your questions and you do something really nasty you're a jerk  oh you're a what a jerk you're a jerk 
[03:02:30]  he did hold it together though who you know tom cruise well i like the fact that he really he did  the guy tried to like you know put a prank on it tom cruise pretty much did call him out on it he had  to kind of respect that he was like well where are you going don't run away you know he didn't yell at  him yeah he wasn't whisked away by somebody real quick and you know he just kind of stood there and 
[03:03:00]  went what did you do why did you do an idiot yeah gotta give it to tom cruise then again the other guy  was just playing a harmless prank i don't know i did both kind of i can't decide who to pick on this  one how would you like it jimmy you're giving an interview about uh spider-man let's say big hit  movie you were in yeah well they tried to block me with toby and kristen dunce but i mean i felt that my  interviews were strong right they were threatened by it um and some guy comes up and squirts you in  the face i don't know how i would feel about this if i thought it was done to humiliate me i'd be 
[03:03:30]  pissed off but it was just some silly prank yeah dude how many years do they have magician things  with the flower where you just get squirted it's like it makes me laugh every time it's a harmless  age-old thing it was a scalding liquid it would be a problem yeah here's the blunt item from the new  york post basically these are things that they they know about but they can't prove to a point where  they would they're brave enough to write the names in right you know what i mean so it says uh well  we could start with the the second one which is what's a blind item that was blind did it say no  no what is that i don't know what that means it's a column they just it's in the post page six it 
[03:04:00]  says just asking and you have to try to figure out what celebrity they're talking about for example  this isn't the one that they're assuming may be the tom cruise thing uh here's another one which teen  terror has herpes the starlet was diagnosed with the social disease recently after fooling around  with several high-profile studs who might have it now too i say female teen she's a teen huh i 
[03:04:30]  that's your guess how old is she she's still a teen 18 19 okay could be an olsen twin but she's not  has she fooled around with high-profile people though no no not really uh yeah did ben just  give the thumbs up to lindsey lohan yeah yeah so he thinks it is wow she's herpes oh no we don't  know stop that means that a guess that's the guess that's our guess okay and then this is the tom  cruise one or a lot of people are saying which top leading man interviewed three different starlets 
[03:05:00]  for the job of girlfriend slash future wife before picking his new beloved god wow that's a tough one  i know that's so obvious mark my words this guy says they'll have a baby said our source  maybe he or she will be conceived in the petri dish but they'll procreate  wow yeah they're playing it off like a movie it really is amazing the machine in hollywood can  pull anything off you gotta respect funny thing is the rumor is katie holmes won't be in the next 
[03:05:30]  batman they were saying they need uh yeah someone with a little more uh acting chops yeah warner  brothers or something what do you mean was she not good brothers was saying she's in the movie  doesn't make anything uh of it not too impressive no it seems to me she was probably in a lot more of  that movie and then just ended up on the floor like it looked like watching the movie it looked like  she should have had a bigger part as his like love interest and and just it kind of just went 
[03:06:00]  nowhere could have pulled her out of the movie never would have noticed that's true so that's  pretty much the um maybe the reason that they're getting together it helps him it helps obviously  helps her yeah it didn't help nicole kidman to be tied into to probably you know one of the biggest  sex symbols in hollywood john what's up hey i wanted to say at least tom cruise held together  didn't say what the fuck is your problem man yeah look at that he got squirt in the face exactly  good point thanks for calling mister ther chien stop it all right you want to take a break and  get into this uh we could do hit me baby one more time we love this show oh yeah we finally got the 
[03:06:30]  tape we didn't have it on friday did we find out who was changing our channels no not yet no who's  changing your channels what do you mean i'm not sure what you missed a lot jimmy oh boy in the office  you know how we tape everything yes and uh we had a show uh hit me baby uh and uh it was supposed to  be recording in in the office somebody had walked in and changed the channel so we never got it  tape somebody's walking into our office changing the channel um now i'm gonna play could it do we 
[03:07:00]  do we ask everybody in the office i believe an investigation was done by our our crew okay  on a crew csi are you sure it wasn't just a mistake in the uh in the setup of the vcr or whatever no and  somebody doesn't want a certain blonde man screaming at them it would and it could be  somebody's afraid that you're gonna yell at them and saying no i've been no it was because it was  taping and then halfway through or piece of the way through it just like cuts off i know i have a  reputation but i've been in a much now steve did say that one remote works all of those recording 
[03:07:30]  devices so if you're if you're watching tv and you walk in and want to change the channel you could hit  that and it perhaps changed all the uh little devices but no one should be in there anyway  watching television so it wasn't a malicious thing where they went in to change the channel to screw  us up they might have just been watching tv in our office could have been one of our guys switching  another channel on something else and making a mistake i'm not accusing anybody i'm just wondering  if it could have been and the thing just mouthing the words no one was here into this program 
[03:08:00]  right now doesn't probably doesn't work yeah all right why don't we uh we'll take a break we'll get  it to hit me baby one more time didn't work yeah i knew that what happened no because i was i tried  to hit one of these little buttons over here oh this doesn't work right it did he says no  what nameless guy number one says no hawk says yes three says yes hawk says yes yeah

[03:10:00]  tripped it steve poured a martini in the mixing board or hawk's breath burnt through the transmission  cord sandy kane blocked the sky with twatto or bob kelly vomited all over the console or howard  stern bought xm for half a billion or pat from runaki drove his fan through the building what's  the meaning the scene three messages are repeating the only way to fix it is a corporate meeting and  opie's not around he's rollerblading in the park and professor anthony can't even get it to start  it's taking forever i hope it don't last long like stalker patty crawling with a crusty mask on 
[03:10:30]  or maybe danny told ricky to stop the show or opie threw a chocolate strawberry at elo  opie anthony show listen to opie anthony every morning live from 7 to 11 a.m and just in case  you missed the show there are replays all day long keep listening stupid on the west coast catch the  opie anthony show replays throughout the day at 8 a.m noon 4 p.m and now at 9 p.m so stop crying

Oh, um  Yeah, uh  Cameo  They did his  Okay, he was at the show  I never heard the band though  What's the song?  Bowling for Soup  You know the song  If we, if we, uh  Played it  What's it called?

Come on  Sean from Jersey  What's up?  Yeah, I saw these guys interviewed on VH1  Evidently the band is named after the sound the guitar makes  When you play all the strings down  And then all the strings back up  It goes  Wang Chung 
[03:25:30]  Oh yeah?  Wow  Fucking assholes  I love it  I love the commentary  Very good  You're right  Alright, well, uh  You know, I think this is worth playing  We'll just play the whole thing  And then we'll finish the show or whatever  It's, uh  Greg Geraldo's act  Lazy Boy  Yeah, the band was Lazy Boy  I never heard this  And it was just something about it  I loved it  Yeah, it was a really popular song  The song was called  Underwear Goes Inside the Parents  Which is a Greg Geraldo bit  Very funny bit, yeah  So they basically put his act to music 
[03:26:00]  And it's, uh  I don't know  It's worth a play here  Let's, uh, just hit that  And we'll, uh  I'll do a little something else  And it  Why is marijuana not legal? 
[03:26:30]  Why is marijuana not legal?  It's a natural plant that grows in the dirt  You know what's not natural?  80-year-old dudes with hard-ons  That's not natural  But we got pills for that  We're dedicating all our medical resources  To keeping the old guys erect  But we're putting people in jail  For smoking something that grows in the dirt  You know, we have more prescription drugs now  Every commercial on TV  Is a prescription drug ad  And I can't watch TV for four minutes  And I'm thinking I have five serious diseases  Like, do you ever wake up tired in the mornings? 
[03:27:00]  Oh my God, I have this  Write this down  Whatever it is, I have it  Half the time you don't even know what the commercial is  There's people running through fields  Or flying kites  Or swimming in the ocean  Like, that is the greatest disease ever  How do you get that?  That disease comes with a hot chick and a puppy  The schools  Now, it's all about self-esteem in a school  Build a kid's self-esteem  Make them feel good about themselves  If everybody grows up with high self-esteem  Who's going to dance in our strip clubs?  What's going to happen to our porno industry?  These women don't just grow on trees  It takes lots of drunk daddies  Missing a lot of dance recitals  Before you decide to blow a goat on the internet for 50 bucks 
[03:27:30]  And if that disappears  Where does that leave me on a Friday  With my new high-speed connection?  Missing a lot of dance recitals  Make me happy  Masterminds are the word that comes up all the time 
[03:28:00]  You keep hearing about these terrorist masterminds  That are being killed over in the Middle East  Terrorist masterminds  Masterminds are sort of a long way to describe what these guys do  Don't you think?  They're not masterminds  Okay, you take bomb, right?  And you put in backpack  Then you get on the bus  And you blow yourself up  Why do I have to blow myself up?  Why do I have to blow myself up?  Who's the f***ing mastermind here?  Me or you?  Americans, let's face it  We've been a spoiled country for a long time  You know what's the number one health risk in America is?  Obesity  Obesity  They say we're in the middle of an obesity epidemic 
[03:28:30]  An epidemic like it's polio  Like we'll be telling our grandkids about it one day  The great obesity epidemic of 2004  How'd you get through it, Grandpa?  Oh, it was horrible, Johnny  There was cheesecake and pork chops everywhere  Nobody knows why we're getting fatter  Look at our lifestyles  I'll sit at a drive-thru  I'll sit there for  I'll sit there behind 15 other cars  Instead of getting up  And making an 8-foot walk  With a totally empty counter  Everything's mega meal, super-sized  Want biggie fries with that?  Want a jumbo fry?  Want a go large?  Want a biggie fry?  Want a 30 burgers for a nigga? 
[03:29:00]  You fat mother f***er  There's room in the bag  Take it  Want a 55-gallon drum of coke with that?  It's only three more cents  Sometimes you gotta suffer a little in your youth to motivate you to succeed later in life 
[03:29:30]  You think if Phil Gates got laid in high school, do you think there'd be a Microsoft?  Of course not  You gotta spend a lot of time stuffed in your own locker with your underwear wedged up your ass  Before you start thinking  I'm gonna take over the world with computers  You'll see, I'll show them  We're in one of the richest countries in the world  And the minimum wage is lower now than it was 35 years ago  There are homeless people everywhere  This homeless guy asked me for money the other day  I was about to give it to him  And I thought, he's just gonna use it on drugs or alcohol  And then I thought, that's what I'm gonna use it on  Why am I judging this poor bastard?  People love to judge homeless guys 
[03:30:00]  Like, you give him the money, he's just gonna waste it  He's gonna waste the money  Well, he lives in a box  What do you want him to do with it?  Save it up and buy a wall unit?  Take a little run to the store for a throw rug and a CD rack?  He's homeless  I walked behind this guy the other day  A homeless guy asked him for money  He looked right at the homeless guy  He goes, why don't you go and get a job, you bum?  People always say that to homeless guys  Get a job like it's always that easy  This homeless guy was wearing his underwear outside his pants  I'm guessing his resume ain't all up to date  I'm predicting some problems during the interview process  I'm pretty sure even McDonald's has an underwear go inside the pants policy 
[03:30:30]  Not that they enforce it very strictly  But technically, I'm sure it's on the books  What is this? 
[03:31:00]  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton  Coffee Diva  Coffee Diva  Look at that cup  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know  It doesn't taste good  I don't like it  Where do we get our coffee every day?

[03:31:30]  Watch this  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice  What's going against the wall?  I'm not going to die  I'm a diva  I'm a diva  I'm a diva  I'm a diva  You betcha  Jim Norton  Norton  Coffee Diva  Coffee Diva  Coffee Diva  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing  At least they're not funding terrorism  Call a bitch  Just a kiss on the lips  And I was on my knees  I'm waiting  I love the jet 
[03:32:00]  Gotta love the jet  They're touring around with Oasis  The Gallagher brothers still haven't killed each other I guess huh?

Lazy Boy  Lazy Boy  That's the one  Right next to it 
[03:33:00]  This is from someone's comedy routine  Still waiting for the funny  No wonder his career has got him stuck playing the stress factory  What?  Who laughs at this?  What a...  Those...  You don't think that's a great...  That's a great line  Do you understand that that was done in the studio?  That's not in front of a live audience  The timing is different  It's like it's spoken word comedy  He's not doing that with the same...  How does anybody not get that?  And there's...  It's more like thought provoking  Yes  I love a comedian that can be thought provoking as well as uh...  Funny 
[03:33:30]  Don't you get that?  Okay, we got a taste of it  You can stop playing this  It fucking sucks  No it doesn't suck  Holy shit  That was the best song you've ever played on the show  Well that's why  It's awesome  That's why I gave up on feedback  Gave up on message boards  Because no matter what you do  There's always some ass that doesn't like it  I think Giraldo had a bigger hit with Rico Suave  That's Giraldo  That's really funny  That is very funny  That is good  Who was that?  Papa Squat from Jersey 
[03:34:00]  Don't our listeners have regular names?  No  I know  I love it  Everyone's got a friggin' handle  That has something to do with this show  Alright  Weren't we gonna do something here?  I know you took another picture of Ben's hog  Is that what that was?  God, that's so funny  I thought I caught somebody smuggling a ham  When are you gonna...  You're gonna put all those pictures in a collage eventually  Yeah, I have to get a lot more though  How many you got so far?  Two  Oh two  I have more, I have a few  That one was a good one though  Yes 
[03:34:30]  You really got his bulge  It's on my computer under the  Uh, uh, uh file  Anthony, you know our listeners are very spoiled too  Because uh, Rob from Cleveland  Rob from Cleveland  Holy shit, how fucking long is this goddamn song?  Yeah  Do you remember listening to the show when we used to do 20 minute commercial stop sets?  Yup  I remember  If that's the worst where we play something that we think is cool and you're not into it  It's gonna be by before you know it  Not  Gone  Not quick enough for them  I think we uh, make the listeners suffer today 
[03:35:00]  They're a machine that just has to constantly be fed  Pack up  Stack up a bunch of commercials  That's how we'll end the show today  That's what we'll do now  I wish we had like stacks of commercials  Well, get them  Know when the carts used to come in?  Steve used to bring them in?  Yeah  His big bulging biceps  He'd bring in a big stack of carts  That's what he had to do, you know  Get all his uh, production done on Friday afternoon  And then we would uh, we would try to make him drop the whole pile  Yeah  We'd like run at him  Yeah  And make like, are you gonna hit him? 
[03:35:30]  I think we even started throwing stuff at him  Yeah, that's right  Even coming, we'd start throwing stuff at him  Cause you guys gotta understand  It was like 20 to 30 carts in his hands at one time  Yeah  All stacked up  Just, yeah  Hey, did I ever show you  Ready to topple?  I'm sorry  Huh?  Did I ever show you the photos I took of Bob Kelly's awful feet?  No  Oh, I  Look at, look at fucking cadaver foot  This is in his apartment on his awful Puerto Rican flag rug  Cadaver foot  This is Bob Kelly's foot  This makes for great radio  I can't wait  Ugh! 
[03:36:00]  What is wrong with this foot?  Let me see  It's blotchy  It looks like  Old age foot  A dead man's foot  That's not  It's Bob Kelly's foot  I took him, but I'm like  Your toes are awful  That was probably a few weeks ago  I totally forgot  And I have that checked out  But just the way  Look at the way it's poking out from behind the table  That's what I had to look at  We should put these online  Yeah  Bob's fucking dead person foot  It looks like it's a dead person just laying there  And that's the only thing you get to see is the foot  Yeah  The vacuum's going  Someone should do a website  Someone should do a website on bad feet 
[03:36:30]  Because man, you see some disasters out there  Complete disaster  Toes underneath other toes  And you know it's worse  Obviously it's a dopey guy's foot  And usually it's in a shoe and that's fine  Girls with ugly feet  That wear open toed shoes  And they're just gnarly  Nasty  Long  Like friggin claw toes  Like talons  Or corns on them or something  Yuck  I don't have a foot fetish or anything  But you know 
[03:37:00]  I don't get that  You can definitely see when one is bad  Yeah  Alright  We're in that weird time  Paris Hilton has awful feet  Does she?  She has awful  I heard that  Huge like  Clown  Yeah, clown feet  But are they shaped nicely  Because foot fetish guys like big feet  If they have like they're properly shaped  And they're not all like corn filled and stuff  I've tried to  Those nasty ones with a lot of like  You see a lot of ligament in them  In the toes  Hey, where's that article Ben was talking about? 
[03:37:30]  Okay  Oh, they're microwaving chicks  Peeps  Peeps or whatever  Why are they microwaving peeps?  Because CNN has run out of shit to talk about  Speaking of CNN  What's going on in Iraq?  Like they're looking for people to carpool now?  More bombings  And they're looking for carpooling  It's the Iraqi way to carpool  In a lot of the areas that are heavy with the insurgents and the car bombings  Now they're requiring two people per vehicle  Because a lot of times the suicide bomber is in the car 
[03:38:00]  He's going to die  Maybe they don't want to waste two people in one shot  Or it's very hard to find two guys at the same time that are willing to do this  Imagine getting into a carpool program  And the next thing you know you're  This guy you don't even know is like just speeding toward a checkpoint  Or just decides to make a lot  The doctor like wait that's not that's not the way to work  Your vest looks a little bulky too for this type of weather  Yeah that and another rule is no trunk lids 
[03:38:30]  You have to take your trunk lid off so that you can  The military can look into your trunk while you're driving  Pretty good rules I'd say after the past couple of days over there  Lunatics blowing each other up  Ah here it is  What is this an article on Mitch Beck's stand-up comedy  Now are we allowed to read this on the air?  Of course you are  Give a ten second explanation of who Mitch Beck is 
[03:39:00]  Mitch Beck is a guy who decided he's a consulting firm guy  Probably couldn't make it as a stand-up comedian or ex-radio personality  And he decided to take a shot at the boys in the um  In the uh the daily news article  He said that he would have fired them and that what they do is basically not funny  I'll quote him exactly so we can't get mad about a misquote  This is in the daily news article Friday the follow-up with Richard Huff  I am 100% in your corner on the O&A thing wrote Mitch Beck  If I were a program director I would fire someone just for suggesting this kind of crap 
[03:39:30]  It's not funny it's not interesting and it's extremely rude  Blah blah blah and then he sent a nasty email to the boys  Where he's calling them Howard Stern clones  The guy's obviously just a Stern fan and that's all he is  He's not even a Stern fan  He thinks that's the way to get under our skin  He might be right  He doesn't listen to any outrageous program  No he admits he didn't listen to it I don't listen to the show  Here's a little details on what he does I guess  It's an article about his stand-up comedy right?  Is it his comedy or just a little bit about him on the whole?  Well the title is Mitch Beck  Stand-up comedian leaves the stage for recruiting business 
[03:40:00]  Recruiting business  Yeah because that's what you do when you're a successful comic  You leave to recruit people  You leave the stage  To headhunt  I'm successful, I'm doing very well  I could be the next Richard Pryor but I'd rather be a headhunter  People that fail at comedy, radio, whatever  Always resent the people that are doing well in it  Absolutely  What happens?  If you're a person that has failed at comedy or radio  You would resent the people that are doing well in it 
[03:40:30]  It's basic human nature  This guy now is doing this headhunting business  But he tries to come off like this fun guy  From what I read in all these interviews  Like he's the fun guy  He would absolutely rather be doing comedy  Who wouldn't?  I think anybody in a situation like that would rather be doing something fun  So he's got this resentment of people that are doing it and successful  It just comes out in his emails  You can make the dullest or the hardest job in the world fun 
[03:41:00]  Said this one time radio personality and stand-up comedian from Monroe  Where the business is located?  I enjoy making people laugh  Because when you're laughing, you're not thinking about the bad  I tell you this guy really tried to get to the heart of an issue  Every day he is not only dealing with all sorts of businesses  Looking to fill positions with a few good people  But also potential candidates who are sometimes out of work  And dealing with constant rejection and financial stress 
[03:41:30]  Wonder where he got the ability to deal with constant rejection from  Yeah  A process that can be painfully boring  A little more fun, said Beck  Who had his own self-titled radio show for several stations around the country  Including Fairfield University's WVOF  Wow  Wow, okay  He was syndicated to college stations?  Dude, it shows 
[03:42:00]  Because this guy said in the email to us that he could have done this type of radio  Or he blew up syndication because why?  He's going to be the next Rush Limbaugh  They wanted to hone him into a Rush Limbaugh type personality  And he said, I'm not going to give up my morality and stuff to do that  So he goes into this other business that he's in  But if you had to pick one of the stations that you were syndicated around the country  It's like anything, you always list your best job  Your best one 
[03:42:30]  Your best radio station  Again, including  Like Jim Norwood would probably talk about how he was on Leno and the Tonight Show  He wouldn't talk about how he played Bananas back in, you know, 95  You list your biggest market  Again, Beck  Best title radio show for several stations around the country  Including  Fairfield University's WVOF  Does anybody out there have tape of the Mitch Beck Show?  Please  For tomorrow  God, would that be fun to play  You will be richly rewarded 
[03:43:00]  Richly  Well, at the very least, they will get a good laugh  Although he loved entertaining, Beck knew that settling down and finding stable work was necessary for starting a family  He was always reluctant  You can't dump a load if you're funny? I don't understand what that means  Yeah  I dump plenty of them, I tell jokes all over the country  Right  Can't spill seed in some broad, silly goose?  I guess unless you're successful and making money doing comedy  Dude, he was on WVOF  I know, stop, you're making me jealous 
[03:43:30]  You guys couldn't even get syndicated to Fairfield  Remember you tried, they're like, look, New York, Philly, Boston  Ha! Fairfield  He was always reluctant to enter the corporate world, man  Even though he had experience as a recruiter  A skill he learned from his mother who ran her own employment agency  I started helping my mother when I was young  An after school job, said Beck  A graduate of Norwalk Community College  He's a community college graduate 
[03:44:00]  Norwalk Community College  Better known as the 13th grade  Oh, wow  I actually did my first job placement at the age of 13  Oh, wow  Norwalk Community College  And then he moved on to WVOF  Fairfield University  Holy shit, and he actually, people are actually coming to this guy at Crossroads Consulting to have job placement?  Holy shit  He would perform stand-up at several area clubs, including the Treehouse in Westport  Hasn't been there in years 
[03:44:30]  His talent on stage eventually landed him in a few minor roles  Even a small part of Woody Allen's radio days  Oh, oh  More of this tomorrow  That's it, I'm out of here  Get out of here  Get out of here </pre>
