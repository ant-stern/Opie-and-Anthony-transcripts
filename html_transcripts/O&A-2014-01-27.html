<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing, profane review of the Grammy Awards.  The hosts relentlessly mocked various performers, including Macklemore (whose sincerity regarding his equality anthem was questioned with offensive language), Taylor Swift (whose dancing was ridiculed), Daft Punk (whose anonymity was a source of humor), Robin Thicke and Chicago (whose collaboration was deemed terrible), Metallica (whose performance with an uncredited pianist was criticized), Ringo Starr (whose drumming was mocked, along with his refusal to sign autographs), Lorde (whose appearance was the target of derogatory terms), Ozzy Osbourne (whose introduction was reportedly botched), and Madonna (whose performance and appearance were deemed ridiculous).  The gay marriage ceremony during the awards was also satirized as forced and contrived.  They speculated on Sean Lennon and Yoko Ono's relationship and discussed the "lasagna belly" in relation to post-pregnancy weight gain.  Potential callers were mentioned, including Paul Williams and Meat Loaf.

Meat Loaf then joined the show, promoting his Las Vegas residency.  The conversation initially touched on Pink's performances, her physique, and potential lip-syncing.  Meat Loaf discussed his documentary, past negative interactions with the show (including a cancellation due to Jimmy Norton's actions, with clips of Norton's harsh commentary played), his experiences with the Grammy Awards, and dealing with online misinformation about his health.  The conversation covered the forced inclusivity of the Grammys and political messaging in music performances, mentioning Bono as an example.  A significant portion detailed Meat Loaf's residency, including production and creative process. A caller who lives near Meat Loaf shared a story about an irritable encounter with him in a supermarket.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about cruise ships and outbreaks of illness, fueled by a news story.  Callers shared anecdotes of sickness and unsanitary conditions, ranging from norovirus to bodily fluids in pools.  The hosts and callers shared humorous, often vulgar, accounts of personal experiences related to public hygiene.  Further caller accounts detailed unsavory experiences, including a man defecating in a pool and the disgusting contents found in a public pool at the day's end.  The conversation expanded to include a derelict ship infested with cannibal rats, the Chernobyl disaster, Macklemore's performance, Lorde's demeanor, racism in a *Gilligan's Island* episode, and Elizabeth Vargas' admission of alcoholism.  A caller offered insight into the origin of stereotypical portrayals of Japanese people in wartime propaganda.  Jim Norton's absence was mentioned due to an interview with Ozzy Osbourne, and Muhammad Ali's family life was briefly discussed.

The next segment began with a conversation about Candy Crush, followed by a discussion of childhood board games and identifying gay men, which included crude and stereotypical perspectives and derogatory comments about Macklemore.  A TMZ-style clip about Magic Johnson's son, EJ, prompted homophobic jokes and remarks about his weight and clothing.  The hosts' reactions ranged from acceptance to discomfort regarding EJ's sexuality and public persona.  A significant portion focused on *90 Day Fiance*, with derogatory comments about participants' appearances and actions, along with generalizations about nationalities.  The conversation included a brief discussion of Justin Bieber's DUI and speculation about Magic Johnson's paternity.  A pre-recorded message from Macklemore, described as a humorous jab at Opie, was played.  The hosts mentioned upcoming guests, including Dr. Ian Smith and Penn Jillette, and a GoToMeeting commercial aired.  An off-air presence named "Don" was referenced throughout.

The final segment opened with speculation about angry staff members, a discussion of Opie's rushed morning routine, and a bizarre tangent about Opie losing a booger.  The conversation shifted to DJ Who Kid's website and TMZ appearance, followed by a vulgar and critical discussion of Meryl Streep, fueled by her presence at a Knicks game with 50 Cent, and speculation about her hypocrisy. The show concluded with Opie and Anthony's departure and a mention of the upcoming post-show with Sam Roberts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, good morning everyone, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A Monday.  Oh yeah.  A, uh, a tired Monday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I stayed up and watched the Grammy, so did Anthony, of course.  Yeah.  I saw your tweets.  Sure.  I actually enjoyed it.  I haven't live tweeted in a while.  Yeah.  That's what Twitter's made for.  It is fun to just watch with everybody else and just fuck around like that.  With me, I try to squeeze out a few extra views for one of my videos, and then I like 
[00:00:30]  to live tweet every once in a while.  Yeah.  And the rest of the time, it's just nonsense, I think.  Just fighting off the haters.  But when you know everyone's in there, and you're just like, you're in this weird competition.  Yeah.  Not even a, I don't know, it's like, it's fun.  Yeah, you're just like trying to pop a funny line out, and some works, some don't.  That's it.  What are you going to do?  Well, you know.  It's like hanging out with people you know, and just goofing around.  Right. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Well, there was a, I forgot who it was, but someone was organizing, getting all the comics  together, and live tweeting.  Oh, really?  You ever do it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember.  They did one or two of those, and that was fun, because you could actually see everyone,  Bob Kelly and whoever.  Yeah, what happened?  They stopped doing that?  They just bailed on it, unfortunately.  It's too bad, because then all you had to do was go to one hashtag, and you could see  everyone that you kind of know and love trying to, like, come up with something funny, you  know?  Yeah.  So, but I enjoyed the hell out of it.  Yeah, it was fun. 
[00:01:30]  There was a lot to goof on.  Yeah.  And then, of course, one idiot's like, can you not be an asshole for just one day?  Shut up.  What was I supposed to tweet?  Oh, John Legend.  Oh, my God.  He's just terrific.  Oh, my God.  That new song by John Legend.  Just fucking amazing.  Oh, yeah.  And then it's like, oh, Anthony, what are you doing?  This hate is beneath you.  Right.  It's like, first of all, no, it's not.  Right.  Don't raise me up to a level. 
[00:02:00]  I'm a terrible person.  I had a good tweet, so then I decided to put it on my Facebook page, and then a guy  goes, it didn't work on Twitter.  Why would it work here?  And I laughed because the tweet actually killed.  I got over a thousand retweets on it.  Pick one of the shitty ones, you idiot.  Pick one of the shitty ones.  It didn't work.  Not the one that absolutely fucking worked.  Oh, that's great. 
[00:02:30]  I mean, what?  What's wrong with your life?  I don't understand it anymore.  No.  I just don't understand it.  There was plenty of good stuff to goof on last night with the Grammys.  I got to say, I cannot fucking stand that Macklemore.  No, I'm not a fan either.  Oh, am I fucking not a fan?  Because I don't believe him.  I don't either.  I don't believe anything.  It comes off his horse shit.  I don't believe what he's rapping about. 
[00:03:00]  I don't believe in his look.  I don't believe in his smile.  No.  I don't believe in his humbleness.  His hair.  I tweeted, go back to Pleasantville.  Yeah.  Here's that Pleasantville look about him.  He's babbling about what?  And then he's preaching to us about what?  He'll let us know what you know, what's good and ethical and nice.  He's he's like our barometer.  Right.  Shut up.  A lot of people didn't know why I just tweeted Beavis face. 
[00:03:30]  They said it's hilarious, but I don't know why because I'm not watching the Grammys.  I just tweeted Beavis face when everyone was getting married.  I was like, what's this about?  It's like.  And then CBS was panicking and they didn't want to have the gays kissing each other.  No, they were like, ah, get the cameras off.  I'm kissing.  Get the cameras off.  The fuck was that, though?  That was so forced.  That was like a morning zoo bit.  It was forced.  In the middle of the Grammys, it was a morning zoo bit.  It's like a purpose, like, let's see how outrageous we can be. 
[00:04:00]  But, you know, we're so politically correct, but we're not showing kissing.  Oh, God.  Without the kissing.  It was really rushed.  Why bother?  Yeah, exactly.  It was really rushed.  It comes out of nowhere.  Look, we only have three minutes for this amazing, dramatic moment that everybody will be talking about on Monday morning.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's going to be great.  Macklemore's babbling about, I don't know.  He looked like some futuristic preacher. 
[00:04:30]  He sure protests too much about not being gay.  Oh, no, whatever.  He's not gay, by the way.  Oh, whatever.  He's a bit obsessed by it.  I can't stand that fucking song, that shit, that fuck.  Just let the gay be gay.  Be gay.  Go ahead.  But stop with this over-the-top trying to force it all the time.  I'll tell you what.  People, you know, who cares?  Right.  They'll get married.  They'll fuck.  They'll do whatever they want.  Right.  You're not going to get everybody to like it.  No.  Obviously, you have to allow them to have their rights like anything else, but, you know. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  And all those people that got married, where did they go after they got married?  Some shitty back room?  Yeah.  Because they weren't giving them good seats in the theater.  They shoved them.  Yeah.  You think they were allowed to go to some of the parties afterwards, or are they just,  no, no, get out of here.  But I was one of the people that got married.  You were a prop.  Right.  You were a fucking prop.  You were a prop for Macklemore's babbling song.  Yeah, and Queen Latifah. 
[00:05:30]  I call that his babbling song.  Oh.  God.  When your brain can't keep up with the words, it's a babbling song.  You gay.  You gay, though.  You gay.  What's Neil Patrick Harris doing?  He gay.  Hey, did Ryan Seacrest get married?  Was he one of them?  Congratulations to Ryan Seacrest.  I think he was one of the ones getting married down there.  Yeah.  Not sure, but.  I wasn't feeling that whole gay marriage thing.  That just came off really forced.  Right.  Really thrown together quickly. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What were some of the other highlights?  Taylor Swift.  Taylor Swift.  And her why me act.  That dancing.  She's a horrible dancer.  And I guess it turns out it's her thing to, what, sit in the front row and dance with  her girlfriend to everybody?  Oh, look out.  She's doing, like, hip-hop shit.  She's trying to, like, dance to hip-hop stuff.  So she's doing the yo-yo, throwing her arms out.  Right, right.  And she just looked.  She looks ridiculous.  Someone said, look like Elaine doing her dance at the fucking party. 
[00:06:30]  Right, right.  Bravo.  She's terrible.  You see the, what is this?  The Jay-Z thing?  What was this?  I can't do it.  Oh, I can't do it.  What is she doing?  What is this?  I don't know.  Look at her dancing like an idiot.  Throwing her arms up in the air like she just don't care. 
[00:07:00]  What's the headline on Us Weekly?  Just Taylor Swift dances.  Oh.  Well, why can't you say Taylor Swift dances badly?  Why do they have to just go with the normal fucking headline?  She was the only one dancing.  Yeah.  Right?  Because she is pretty.  You know.  What do you think of the Beyonce and that A's?  That's how the Grammy started.  I was thinking about you.  Her A's.  Her ass.  Looking all hot and shit.  Oh, Christ.  And then Jay-Z comes out in that tuxedo. 
[00:07:30]  I can't tell you that.  And his bow tie.  Those two.  Fucking royalty.  Enough of them.  But they're in love.  Are they?  Yeah.  That's great.  Everyone wants to be in love like Jay-Z and Beyonce.  Of course they do.  Oh, God.  Everyone looks up to their relationship.  Of course.  Hoping they can have a little Jay-Z or Beyonce in their own relationship.  They're the big power couple.  Boy, are they. 
[00:08:00]  People love them.  I don't know.  Beyonce got her ass back in shape after the baby, though.  See, it's possible, Ann.  See?  You don't think it's possible.  I think it is if you're, you know, Beyonce.  You take care of your pregnancy in the right way, you can get that body right back to where it was.  Back into shape.  It's the ones that decide to eat a little too much.  They're the ones that get the lasagna belly.  They just give up.  Yeah.  I mean, because quad will allow the skin to stretch to a point.  Will quad do that? 
[00:08:30]  Yes.  Quad allows that.  But if you go too far, there's a point of no return, and that's where the lasagna belly comes into play.  That deflated fucking pool toy.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  And then you got robots winning everything, which I thought was hilarious when the robots won everything.  They literally won everything as all those other people were sitting there.  But you make a great point.  They have to look weird. 
[00:09:00]  They have to feel.  They have to feel so silly.  Some would say they look cool, but they have to feel silly.  They got to feel silly.  They're all around music legends and royalty out there.  And they have to wear a little robot space suit thing and just look like a gimmick.  Yeah.  Like, it just, oh, you're the gimmick guys.  Yeah, they're wearing props.  Yeah.  And they're looking through their motorcycle helmets, and they're seeing, like, Paul McCartney.  And they're probably thinking, wow, Paul McCartney never had to fucking do this. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, he never had to put on a fucking helmet like this.  Why are we walking around like idiots?  Yeah.  We got to fucking wear these and not talk.  And we go up to win an award, and we just stand there.  Right.  You know what?  If Daft Punk was in New York today, they're walking around like us.  No one even knows.  No one even knows who they are.  No one even knows that they won all those Grammys last night.  Bump into, like, one of Daft Punk's biggest fucking fans, and the guy would be like, hey, 
[00:10:00]  watch where you're going, asshole.  Right.  You think they walk around with, maybe they hold.  Oh, hold the helmet under their arm?  Hold the motorcycle helmet?  Yeah, yeah.  That way.  Hey.  Excuse me.  Please, look out for my helmet.  I thought it was hilarious that Stevie Wonder had no idea that he was performing with motorcycle  helmets.  Oh, he had robots with them?  He had no idea.  I thought that was great.  He's just standing there.  He's singing his ass off and doing his thing and has no idea that it's just goofy fucking 
[00:10:30]  motorcycle helmets behind him.  Wacky robots.  They can't even talk.  So our pal, Paul Williams.  Paul Williams.  He got up there and accepted for Daft Punk, which was kind of cool.  Yes, it's an old-fashioned love song playing on the radio.  We're going to have to give him a little love you, miss you call this morning.  Oh, that's right.  Hope's got his personal home number there on his phone.  I sure do.  I mean, it's West Coast time.  He may still be out celebrating.  He could be out partying.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Hey, Lou!  What was it?  Album of the Year?  Album of the Year.  Which is Record of the Year, or is that Song of the Year, or is that Performance of the  Year?  What is Album of the Year?  Album of the Year is Album of the Year.  The whole goddamn album?  Yeah.  Daft Punk had a lot of hits off that thing?  No.  Yeah, that was a little weird.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  There are a lot of hit songs out there that get a lot more kind of airplay.  That's the Billboard Awards.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, let me see.  Who picks this? 
[00:11:30]  The Too Cool for the Room people?  That's exactly right.  Oh, okay.  Oh, shit.  Did I ever...  Is that why Macklemore wins things?  Because he's so fucking politically correct, and...  If this were based on hits, Macklemore would have won that.  You know, if Macklemore was the president, everything would be great.  People would love each other.  He comes across so forced.  I would love to fucking catch, like, hidden audio of him just dropping N-bombs and calling  people faggots and stuff.  Just going fucking out of his mind. 
[00:12:00]  Because I just...  He looks like a hypocrite.  Yeah, no one is that nice.  No one's that accepting of everything.  Yeah, no one is that accepting.  No one's that accepting.  Exactly.  Get the fuck out of here.  Fuck him.  And his partner there looked like he threw a little sissy fit.  Oh, did he?  A little sissy fit?  Yeah, because...  Sissy fit.  Which one's the Macklemore guy?  Is he the one with the fucking shaved sides?  Yeah.  That looks like he's from Pleasantville?  The fucking ginger.  Well, the other guy looked like he threw a hissy fit, because there was no time for  him when they won for the first time. 
[00:12:30]  Oh.  Oh, and he wanted to say a little something?  Yeah, he looked like he could be a problem.  He looks like he maybe doesn't agree with all the acceptance.  Oh, with all that accepting?  He wanted to maybe say something?  Right.  Macklemore took up all his time with his acceptance.  And there was a bit of a tiff, it looked like.  Macklemore literally gives an acceptance speech.  Yeah.  He gets up there and talks about accepting everybody for who they are, and yuck.  Some bullshit.  You fucking phony. 
[00:13:00]  That's some bullshit right there.  That is some bullshit.  I like your line.  There's nothing, you know, no one's that accepting.  No one is that accepting of everything.  And then I guess our boys Metallica decided, hey, we're way too fucking cool.  We gotta fucking, we gotta fuck this up a little bit.  Yeah, we gotta do it.  We'll do one of our fucking, you know, classic songs, but let's just fuck it up.  Let's get some piano guy.  Right.  I'm someone out there right now.  Ling Ling?  Long Long? 
[00:13:30]  Piano guy?  Do you know who that is?  Long Long?  Who is it?  Who cares?  Who the fuck was that guy?  I just know it was very distracting.  Yeah.  It really was.  Yeah.  Who cares?  Someone said, who cares?  We all know Asians can play the fucking piano.  Someone said, I hope that's not their bus driver.  Which is a pretty good fucking tweet.  The song still sounded great, but we didn't need to.  That Black Album ruined everything.  They sold out.  That's what every artist is trying to do, is sell out. 
[00:14:00]  I know, exactly.  God.  Every single artist.  The only one that never wanted to sell out was Gigi Allen.  Right.  There's a short list of people that never wanted to sell out.  Exactly.  But when your band becomes extremely popular, that's what they wanted.  Yeah.  When you're shoving bananas up your ass and shitting them out on your audience, you've pretty much  written off the fact that you want major acceptance from the...  That could be our list today.  Artists that did not want to sell out. 
[00:14:30]  Didn't want to sell out.  I'm telling you, that's a short fucking list.  That is a real short list.  Rr-fushy!  Rr-fushy!  And then Farrell Williams' hat there.  Farrell.  It's Farrell.  Is that his name?  It is.  It's Farrell.  Shake it up, shake it up.  Oh, the other one.  It's Farrell Williams.  All right.  The Urban Sombrero that he had on.  Yeah, but...  What the fuck?  The problem with Twitter, obviously everyone was going to go with the, you know... 
[00:15:00]  Smokey the Bear joke.  Like Smokey the Bear joke or like a Canadian Mountie.  You know someone has that cover.  That's what makes Twitter a bit tricky.  Yeah, you gotta know.  So, I actually didn't have one for that.  You don't want to be part of the crowd that has the same joke.  I retweeted the Arby's guy because I thought that was clever.  Yeah.  His hat looks like the Arby's fucking logo.  It looked like the Arby's logo hat.  And then stupid Arby's, they weren't smart enough to figure that out on their own.  So, the Arby's tweet went, you know, viral. 
[00:15:30]  And then Arby's jumps on the bandwagon way late and goes,  Hey, Farrell, we want our hat back.  Someone already said that, Arby's.  They got Arby's all over me.  But they had to be told, look, hey, dude, that hat looks like your fucking logo.  Yeah.  Oh, hey, we want our hat back.  Yeah.  That hat is goofy.  He wears that from time to time.  That is a dumb looking hat.  He's a big fan of over the top stupid hats. 
[00:16:00]  Everyone tries for a gimmick.  You know, they all try for that gimmicky thing.  Right.  What was that country chick with the light up boots?  She was hot.  She was wearing fucking curtains.  She was fucking hot.  She was hot.  I hear you.  I guarantee when she was walking up those steps that a lot of guys were trying to take  a peek to see if they could see the tank.  See up there?  That was a short little skirt she had on there.  Oh, boy, was it short.  But her song is like another one of these dumb country songs.  I think she sort of sounded like Taylor Swift.  They all sound like that.  I don't know. 
[00:16:30]  And the country singer guys all sound the same.  Oh, not really.  I don't know.  Not the old school guys, but.  Chris Christopherson should have.  That's what I mean.  Like the old school guys.  Oh, boy.  He should have jumped through that screen when they were doing the death montage.  Yeah, yeah.  He should have fucking thrown himself onto the list.  Man.  As a last minute arrival.  A rival.  What's going on with him?  He was in Blade.  What's the fuck?  Chris Christopherson is just extremely old, I guess.  He's got to be pushing 80. 
[00:17:00]  He is.  He's been around our entire lives.  And Willie, too.  Willie just like fucking.  But he's still doing it.  See the size of Willie's ears?  He's got old man ears.  Like for some reason, your ears just keep growing and your head shrinks a little.  All right.  Willie's ears were fucking distracting.  But he looks exactly how he looks when we interviewed him back at N.E.W.  Yeah.  I swear he looks exactly the same.  He started looking like an old man about 25 years ago. 
[00:17:30]  And that was it.  And he's pretty much stayed right on that level ever since.  Not looking too much older.  He keeps the braids.  Right.  He keeps the fucking gruff beard thing going.  Bandana.  Yep.  Probably that covers up some of the hurt.  You think he's got some hurt going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They had that little country thing that was going on.  Holy shit.  A little Merle Haggard coming out.  When they did Okie from Muskogee. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  It's like, oh boy.  That song is like.  That was one of the big anti-hippie songs of like the 60s, 70s kind of thing.  70s, I guess.  I'm not sure.  But that's not a very PC song, you know?  Right.  That's like.  What is it about?  Fuck the hippies.  It's like you're an Okie from Muskogee.  You're into like, you know, all the good American things.  Some of that redneck shit.  And not some of that hippie fag shit that's going on in San Francisco.  Oh, I gotcha.  That was their whole fucking gist back then. 
[00:18:30]  That was their message.  Yeah.  Which one would you have rather been back then, though?  Well, I'd be proud to watch old Glory waving in front of the courthouse.  Seriously.  But the hippie broads.  Yeah.  That's true.  You've got to be torn, I'm thinking.  That's true.  The hippie broads are pretty good.  But.  Hippie broads just going topless.  Yeah.  We just don't have that anymore.  Yeah.  But they were like filthy, hairy, armpitted fucking LSD'd out.  You were just able to handle smells better back then.  That's true, too. 
[00:19:00]  If you were living through that time, you just accepted it.  It didn't bother you as much.  No, no.  I bet you're right.  Yeah.  No.  There weren't all those perfumes.  Madison Avenue had to tell us that we were bothered by it.  The old ladies wore Chanel No. 5, and that was it.  The young chicks didn't wear anything.  I don't think there was perfume back then.  Not for young people.  Nope.  And then the commercials started popping up.  Oh, we're supposed to hate these smells.  I got it, Val.  That stench that's wafting up from her armpits as she's spinning around, sweating, dancing to the dead. 
[00:19:30]  I'm telling you right now, I think there'd be a lot less divorces if we had just our natural smells.  Yeah.  You get tricked sometimes.  Like, if there's a perfume you really like, and you're in a bar, and that girl's wearing that perfume, you don't even notice that she's a fucking cunt.  That's it.  Because you're like, oh, that's the smell I like.  But if she wasn't wearing it.  You would smell that she's a twat.  That you don't like her.  Yeah.  You would absolutely smell that she's a twat, and you would have moved on to somebody else.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  You know, there's a reason why.  Yeah.  The natural smells, you know, help us out.  It's true.  But we cover that shit up now.  And we get tricked.  All of our senses are there to, you know, sight, obviously, when you see somebody you're attracted to.  Right.  Hearing.  You like the way they sound.  Their ears.  The sense of touch.  You like the way they feel.  So why wouldn't smell also dictate your feelings?  I'm not even really joking.  I hear you.  I'm not even really joking.  It's turning out to sort of be a joke, but I'm not joking. 
[00:20:30]  No, no.  I bet you that is a real issue.  And they cover it up with perfume, and all of a sudden you're like, oh, she's cool.  Oh, my God.  But then it works the other way.  When a girl is attractive and you think you're into her, but she has one of those perfumes that fucking sucks.  You're out.  Then you're out.  You don't even want to fucking, you know, try.  We ought to go back to, or just do what dogs do.  Nose firmly planted up the ass.  Right.  Give a few sniffs.  I think you could determine if you like somebody from that. 
[00:21:00]  There should be a bar where you're not allowed to wear a cologne or perfume.  Yeah.  And it's completely accepted to smell each other's assholes.  You just walk up, give a little sniff.  Smell the undercarriage.  I'm fine.  How do you do?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Get a nice one.  Like, hey, you want a drink?  Hey, can I buy you a drink?  Right.  I like what I smell.  Yeah.  My God, man.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  I guarantee we're just fucking it up because we think we know better as humans. 
[00:21:30]  When nature figured all this stuff out for us.  Yeah.  You know?  Nope.  Nah.  That Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr thing.  Worst kept secret.  The fuck was that about?  Worst kept secret.  And Paul McCartney doesn't want anything to do with Ringo Starr.  Nothing.  Or the fucking family members or the other guys.  Nope.  He's doing his thing.  That was 50 years ago. 
[00:22:00]  And he don't give a fuck.  They're making an exciting thing that it was 50 years ago in, what, February?  Yeah, February 9th, I think.  February 9th is the 50th anniversary of the Beatles came to America.  Paul McCartney don't give a fuck about that.  I still got a career, motherfuckers.  I mean, he cares, but he doesn't care enough to now have to be parading around with Ringo Starr.  He cares because of Paul McCartney.  Right.  You know?  He doesn't care because Ringo or Yoko.  Right.  Or Yoko's fucking kids.  It's all about Sir Paul. 
[00:22:30]  Dude, you know my theory on the Sean Lennon and the Yoko.  What?  Are you starting to see it?  What?  Some weird fucking relationship going on there.  Oh, do you think they're having sex together?  I, I, there's some weird shit going on there.  Some weird Norman Bates-y kind of shit?  Yeah, Yoko's like, you know, can you please look exactly like John Lennon?  Yeah.  And Sean has no problem looking exactly like John Lennon.  And they're about the same age now, I think.  I think.  That's crazy.  I think it's getting close. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  At this point, it's probably close.  Oh, man.  How long has John been dead?  82, was it?  No, 80, right?  80.  80, right.  So that's 20, 34 years ago.  And yeah, it's about right.  Because I think he was about four or five, Sean Lennon, right?  So he's about the age of his old man and looking just like him.  Yee.  I think Yoko just like looks lovingly in his eyes and is thinking that maybe John is around  for one more day.  Oh, hello, John. 
[00:23:30]  And he's like, no, Mom.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the whole Ringo Paul thing.  Right.  There was another drummer playing.  Yeah.  Because Ringo can't play.  That was in the dark.  He was in the dark.  It was his regular, Paul's regular drummer.  It was his regular, Paul's regular drummer.  Awesome.  And then like Ringo, and you'd notice like Ringo would be doing something and then his  sticks weren't even touching the drums and you're hearing like, you're hearing like  these cool fills that Ringo ain't even doing.  Because he probably didn't know the song. 
[00:24:00]  Of course he didn't.  He's terrible.  Ringo probably hasn't picked up drumsticks in years.  Yeah.  That was embarrassing.  They're going to play again at that, you know, Beatles.  Why?  50th anniversary.  Yeah.  Just being, I think, I don't know.  I guess maybe because it helps Paul's new song, which was just.  I don't, Paul doesn't need any help.  I know.  Do you think Paul McCarty wants to hang out with Ringo Starr? 
[00:24:30]  No.  Oh, talk about the albatross around the neck.  Right.  Holy shit.  Oh, so that was Paul McCarty's regular drummer?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then they didn't even put a spotlight on him.  He was in the dark drumming and then the light is on Ringo.  Right.  What would they think?  Maybe they wouldn't notice.  After all the goofing that Ringo has gone through for not being a good drummer, having  his drum tracks replaced by the rest of the band when he would leave the studio, things  like that.  He agrees to get up there and it's like, oh, by the way, Ringo, we're going to put 
[00:25:00]  a second drummer.  Well, there's strong rumors that Paul McCarty went in and did a lot of the drumming after  Ringo left and other people.  Yeah.  And if you're Ringo, you just, you must have known when you heard the record, like, wait  a minute, wait a minute, that's a little different.  What?  That's a little strange.  I don't remember doing that.  Right.  That's a part I didn't throw in.  I must have.  I'm more of a genius than I ever thought.  I said Ringo Starr got his Make a Wish Granted by Paul McCartney. 
[00:25:30]  I don't know.  And this new song is terrible.  It just sounds like him trying to sound like Paul McCartney.  When you have such a catalog of hits, it must be really tough to put new music out there.  Yeah.  You know, what's the name of the song?  Queenie or something like that?  Queenie Eye.  Queenie Eye.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Can we hear just a little bit of it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  BBS.  Let's say Macklemore.  Really?  Macklemore was...  That was the worst part of the night.  The worst part of the night was having to watch that fucking lump of shit phony preaching,  letting all us know what a better person he is because he's so accepting.  Fuck him.  What?  But here's the song he performed, I believe.  Fucking ginger cocksucker.  About equality and just seeing we're all the same person in the end.  I thought that I was gay.  I thought that I was gay. 
[00:26:30]  Shut up, you're white, you fuck.  You are so white.  He thought he was gay in third grade.  Fucking wigger.  Yeah.  He's pulling this wigger shit.  I don't know shit in third grade.  Yeah, you know what gay is in third grade.  In third grade, you know what gay is?  Yeah.  That's gay.  Exactly.  I would just say, that shit's gay, but I wouldn't, you know.  Oh, shut up.  Barely even knew what regular, like, straight sex was.  I thought straight sex was fucking in the ass. 
[00:27:00]  I thought you had to put it in her ass.  And I thought you had to wear a condom to get a girl pregnant.  Sure.  Because the stuff was on the condom that made a girl pregnant.  That's great.  So if that's the truth, then, like, you could pick what kind of kid you're going to have?  I had no idea.  At the drugstore?  I didn't give it that much thought, but I just thought, yeah.  Here's the condoms if you want a lily white kid.  Yeah, yeah.  I gotcha.  You put the, because I heard it called a scumbag.  Right.  So I thought the scum was on the bag, and the scum was the stuff that got her pregnant. 
[00:27:30]  Nice.  But you had to put it in her ass.  And then that made the magic formula.  That did it.  A scumbag up the ass.  And boy, you got a bun in the oven.  Stupid Macklemore.  Macklemore.  Preaching to us.  Oh, all kinds of acceptance.  Gay, fucking minority, immigrants, everyone.  I think even Love Dolls is okay.  I think that was in the song.  He is so accepting of everybody. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  I can't wait for that fucking asshole to fall off his pedestal.  He will.  Enough.  Have you guys spoken about how ugly Lord is?  Yes, we have.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  That video.  They cussied her up a little for the video.  For Royals.  They made her look kind of nice and everything.  With her beautiful eyes, and she has, like, her hair was blown out.  She's a beast.  She's 17 going on 40. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, shit.  Right?  Oh, she looks like she crawled out of the well from the ring.  Right.  My family.  I love you guys.  My manager.  I like you a lot.  And, um, and, and Ella, of course, I mean, you know, you're amazing in myself.  I mean.  Well, she's very awkward.  I probably wouldn't be here if Joel wasn't here.  This guy has nurtured me through.  That's her hair, though, man.  First years of songwriting, which.  And her dark outfit. 
[00:29:00]  She's got nice eyes.  She's got gorgeous eyes.  Let the song explode.  Because it's been mental.  Universal, Lava, Songs Publishing, Psycho, and my family.  Thank you.  Aw.  She's very awkward.  Very shy.  She's awkward in her skin.  But she's only 17.  That's it.  Crazy, too.  Because you guys broke this song, like, a couple weeks ago.  Thank you, Sam.  It's about time you acknowledge that shit.  Maybe three weeks ago.  We turned everyone on to the new song.  It's already, like, three weeks ago. 
[00:29:30]  Two weeks ago.  Two weeks ago.  Yeah.  It's a fucking hit.  How is it Grammy nominated?  It's fucking nuts.  I guess Grammy.  I mean, I know the Grammy committee listens to the show.  Yeah, yeah.  They must have heard something.  So Supergirl Beja was nominated for something.  Well, I was hoping.  I certainly was hoping.  But Lorde just, she's, oof.  Lorde.  I tweeted that she looks like the Kardashian sister they keep in the attic.  Oh, jeez.  She's.  You've got to understand the sisters to get that one. 
[00:30:00]  She's not.  The Kardashians actually have an ugly sister.  They do.  Yeah.  There's two young ones.  And the one is going to become a massive supermodel.  Right.  There's the model one.  And making, it's starting to make Kim Kardashian look kind of frumpy.  Yeah.  And old.  And her sister from that marriage with, I guess, Bruce and Chris.  There's another one that's.  Not really.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Not really.  The one that's not going to really get a show.  Not so much.  Not so much.  No.  Yeah.  The worst moment for me.  Yeah.  Was that Chicago horse shit.  Was that earlier on the show?  You tapped in later?  Yeah.  I missed the beginning.  The Chicago medley with, what's his name there?  Robin Thicke?  Yeah.  Robin Thicke was just all over the fucking place.  That sounds terrible.  It was horrible.  Yeah.  It was, do we have that performance? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Because Ant didn't see this.  I think Robin Thicke's done.  He stinks.  You go, now see, this sounds good.  I like Chicago, but that's Robin Thicke.  Like, you can't tell that he's sat there?  Robin Thicke comes out and he stinks.  You're right.  I would say that.  You have blinders on.  You just, because someone's young and new, they gotta be way better than the old guys.  No, but because somebody's young and new.  Did you hear how that old guy was singing?  That was some good shit right there.  Yeah, but because someone's young and new, they can't possibly be as good.  Saturday, yeah, in the park, in the park, in the park, in the park, with my doggie in the park, yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Chicago, Chicago.  Chicago, Chicago.  Terrible.  Terrible's right.  And Robin Thicke, I'm telling you, will not have another song close to Blurred Lines.  I think he's done.  Right.  Can we hear the rest of this?  Yes.  Robin Thicke fucked up the whole thing.  Not just fucking Robin, Chicago.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Whatever.  What are you going to do?  They just love the clusterfuck, Metallica and the piano player guy.  Right.  It's just, let's throw these things together to make this big moment, and it just doesn't,  who cares?  Mm-hmm.  Can't say shit.  Let's see if we did it.  Awesome clip on Deadspin of Taylor Swift thinking she won.  That's great.  Yeah, that's pretty fun.  Yeah, yeah.  Random access memory.  They go, and they're like, ah, it's red, ah.  No. 
[00:32:30]  And then you see her people behind her going, ah, shit.  Oh.  They were excited, and they went, ah, shit.  Do you think she squirted a little?  She looks like she squirted a little.  She did.  And then had to pull back, like, oh, shit.  Mm-hmm.  She's got a little gushy.  I don't like her.  You don't like the Taylor Swift?  No.  No.  Oh, God, no.  She looks good, but she's an idiot.  Why is she an idiot?  Ah.  Her whole everything, her personality has never come off as something kind of fun or anything.  She's another phony. 
[00:33:00]  I like her recovery, though.  You can kind of tell she's trying to do the, oh, my God, I can't believe that you guys won.  Yeah.  I'm such a fan of you.  It's good for the robot heads.  Mm-hmm.  I'm so glad the robot-headed things won.  Uh.  And then, who a lot?  I have to fucking shake my ass and fucking show my tits and everything, and you guys get  to wear a little fucking helmet.  Right.  I don't know.  And they, Trent Reznor was not happy. 
[00:33:30]  They cut him off.  Yeah, they did.  Yeah.  They completely cut him off.  And what did he say?  He, uh, he sent a tweet.  Oh, it said, uh, music's biggest night, uh, to be disrespected, a heartfelt fuck you guys.  Yeah.  No one fucking cares.  Well, it was an, it was an afterthought.  You didn't even know the Grammys were over.  Yeah.  And then, all of a sudden, they just started rolling credits as, uh, they were performing.  Who was it?  Uh, Queen, Queens of the Stone Age, Trent Reznor, Lindsey Buckingham.  Oh, that's who that was.  Lindsey Buckingham.  Dave Grohl. 
[00:34:00]  And then LL was like, this is how we rock!  And then they did, like, a little bit, and then credits.  And then credits.  That's a Delta Airlines fucking spot.  Right.  They gave him about a minute or so.  Yeah.  At that point, the Grammys were running really late.  It was almost midnight at that point.  It was a quarter to twelve.  Yeah, so they could have went to twelve.  What's the difference at that point?  I'm sure they weren't told that you're going to be fucking outro music.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  While you're playing, we're just going to over, you know, put over commercials, and they gave  him the Fox and Friends treatment.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:34:30]  You're just a bumper.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And I'm a big Nirvana fan, but I hate seeing Chris Novoselic.  Why?  I don't know, man.  He has, like, no business being up there anymore.  Yeah, I think so.  No.  Yeah.  There's a goofball in Nirvana, and now, I don't know.  Tell you what.  Don't you love seeing Pat Smear, too?  Oh, yeah.  Pat Smear.  I love Pat Smear.  I like Pat Smear a lot, and I like Dave Grohl a lot.  I do like people.  Everyone loves Dave Grohl.  But Chris Novoselic is the fucking man. 
[00:35:00]  Dave Grohl.  Dave Grohl, he looks like he's eating quite well, Dave Grohl, these days.  Oh, I know.  Of course.  He's going to have to cut the hairs out.  He's getting a little chubby.  He's holding on to that hair, but...  He is.  He is.  Maybe one more year that he's going to have to do something.  He is good.  Are they working on a new record?  The Foos?  Yes, they are.  Oh, good.  That would be nice to hear.  You think he'll have to cut his hair, and he's getting a double chin thing on.  He's got some fat under his neck. 
[00:35:30]  You know, whatever.  What kind of clips can we play?  What am I to say?  We pretty much did it, I think.  Madonna looked ridiculous with her fucking cowboy outfit and her cane.  And a grill.  Yeah.  She had a grill.  And she looks so frozen.  She's got frozen face.  Bad.  Yeah.  She has really fucked up her face, man.  Yeah.  And that's what makeup on.  Can you imagine what that looks like when you fucking wipe that shit off for bedtime?  Oh, boy. 
[00:36:00]  There's like some weird thing going on with her cheeks.  Yeah.  I guess it's cheek implants with everything else tight, so you can see the cheeks moving  by themselves at times.  You could get cheek implants.  I don't know.  It's crazy.  I don't really understand why they do that shit to their faces.  Jesus Christ.  That's creepy.  And her fucking JonBenet wear.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  The cowboy thing.  Mm.  Rian.  Mm.  I'm trying to think of what else was on that really annoying. 
[00:36:30]  LL is host, but, you know, LL's always LL.  That's Zeppelin one.  Best rock album.  Oh, yeah.  Best rock album for somebody who did a couple years ago that had a lot of songs that were  30 years old.  30 years old.  That should not be fair, I think.  And I love Zeppelin.  Mm.  Yeah.  It was just a live album.  You're right.  And then what happened to...  But there's no other...  Well, no.  Jack White.  Yeah.  They should fucking...  Yeah.  Jack White has a nice original piece of music there.  Album of original music. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, you know what you guys didn't talk about?  What?  Ozzy Osbourne completely fucking up the intro.  Yeah.  What happened to Zeppelin?  Well, we're scared of saying anything, because, you know, we don't want to hear from Jimmy.  What happened?  I missed that part, I think.  When they talked to him backstage, he's like, yeah, I completely fucked that up.  And they were like, what were you supposed to say?  He's like, I don't fucking know.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you have that?  Oh, yeah, man.  It was horrible.  I missed it.  You missed that?  That was early on.  Did they win anything?  Yeah, they won, like, best metal performance.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  How many metal bands were...  What? 
[00:37:30]  Great award to win.  I don't think they're metal.  Huh?  That's like...  You don't think they're metal?  No, I think they're rock.  I think they're rock.  I don't think they're metal.  Hmm.  Especially by today's standard of what metal is.  Yeah, the definition has certainly changed.  Yeah.  Yeah, Ozzy just babbled.  Did he?  I think Geezer was just laughing at him.  Was he?  Oh, yeah, it was hilarious, because Ozzy, I guess, can't read or something. 
[00:38:00]  I don't know what it is, or maybe he didn't have his glasses on.  I don't know.  My glasses.  Maybe he needs contacts under those sunglasses.  I think Ozzy's shot.  Of course he is.  I just think he's fucking shot at this point.  We love him.  We love when he's on the show, but...  Yeah.  What the fuck's going on there, man?  But I mean, you know, he's more of a free-form guy than a scripted teleprompter kind of fucking intro guy.  Right.  Can't find it?  Mm-mm.  That's weird.  I wonder why that's not up there.  That's how memorable Ringo Starr's performance was. 
[00:38:30]  Ringo.  He gives a fuck about Ringo.  Fuck Ringo.  He sucks.  Ringo.  Stupid name, too.  And his dumb piece sides.  All right.  I don't even sign fan mail anymore.  What a piece of shit.  Yeah.  I won't be signing fan mail.  Don't send it to me.  And he...  And he...  Was that at, like, a...  It wasn't a tweet.  What was it back then?  No, it was like he sent out, like, a video message.  Yeah, a video message.  So he makes his video message from his castle because he was in the Beatles. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  And he has a problem with signing fan mail.  Why wouldn't you just sit around and sign fan mail?  God, I wish I could just sit around all day and sign fan mail.  That'd be awesome.  I'm telling what I've got already, but nothing new.  He is a piece of shit.  He is, right?  What else do you have to do?  Yeah, what is Ringo doing?  And he didn't write any of the cool shit.  Waiting for Paul to call.  He's obviously not working on Paul's song to play the drums to.  He wrote a couple goofy songs.  Big fucking deal.  Yeah.  All the real songs that you know the Beatles for were written by the other three guys. 
[00:39:30]  His haunting voice.  In a town where I was born...  It's all off-key.  It just sounds like he's fucking yelling.  You listen to fucking something like Yesterday and shit.  It's fucking beautiful and melodic.  In a town where I was born.  And the only reason those songs got in was because Paul and John were probably fighting  that day to like, yeah, whatever, fuck, yeah, just do the fucking Ringo song.  Oh, you want to do that, do you? 
[00:40:00]  Well, I'll put the fucking Ringo song on.  Oh, no.  It's like a threat.  They were probably using Ringo against each other.  Like a threat, yeah.  Oh, yeah?  You didn't think he was as melodic as the other.  Oh, God.  In a town.  You got like Yesterday fucking...  Right.  Even...  All of them.  I mean, George.  George.  George was a genius.  While my guitar gently weeps and shit like that.  And then...  In a town where I was born.  It's terrible. 
[00:40:30]  Born.  Oh, born.  Oh, turn the shit off.  He's not a talent, is he?  No.  No, he's not.  Us old guys have never thought that there was a talent.  He was awful.  He was terrible.  Just the worst part of the Beatles ever.  By far, right?  Yeah.  You'll tolerate it because there's other songs around this that are great.  Yeah.  There's nothing going on with this song. 
[00:41:00]  And then the rest of the band had a fucking numeral.  Yeah, they had to bail him out on the chorus.  Yellow submarine.  Return of a life preserver.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Yee, Ringo.  Ringo.  Stupid Ringo.  Whatever happened to the other guy, Pete Bess.  Because you replaced me with him?  With that motherfucker?  With him?  Really?  That must have depressed him, too.  Right.  A lot. 
[00:41:30]  Jesus.  What's that now?  Is it the meat here?  We should break for meatloaf.  Oh, but I have eggs.  Wow.  Oh, I get it.  It's meatloaf.  So what's meatloaf doing?  What is he up to?  He's in Vegas doing one of those residency things.  Planet Hollywood?  Where he sits there and does meatloaf songs day in and day out.  Is he going to do Paradise by the Dashboard Light?  I bet I'll get to it.  Think he'll do that one?  What's he going to do? 
[00:42:00]  I want to know if he's wearing the wig still.  Oh.  Oh.  We'll ask him.  What?  It was in his documentary where he has to put on the young wig and he replaced the girl  with a young girl.  Right, right.  He's trying to keep that alive.  But to play his part, he puts on a wig.  Yeah.  It was the most disturbing part of the documentary.  People fucking called him out on how creepy it was.  Yeah.  Oh, the press called him out on how creepy it was that he was wearing a wig. 
[00:42:30]  I'm trying to recall our last spot.  He was cool.  He was cool, right?  Yeah.  A little wacky, but very cool.  A little wacky.  What are we going to do with the meatloaf?  Are we going to have just a basic interview?  Are you talking about the Grammys?  Is Colin listening?  No, get topical with him.  It's got me flustered.  Get topical?  Yeah, shoot the shit about the Grammys.  What does he think about Macklemore?  Of course he's going to think it's the...  No, it's just great.  So let him know it's not.  It's meatloaf.  This is a good way to start your time.  I don't even...  My whole point with the Macklemore is he's trying way too hard. 
[00:43:00]  I don't even give a fuck.  He's singing about some deeper topics.  It's just that I don't believe him.  Do you know how many people go up to him on a daily fucking basis and feed that bullshit  ego with like, dude, if it wasn't for you, I feel like I can do this now and I'm accepted.  You gave me the strength.  Yo, yo, thank you, man.  You gave me the strength.  I do this, you know, I do this because shut up. 
[00:43:30]  You do this.  You do this.  Why?  The real Macklemore is the dude with the hands on the ceiling because it's falling down or  whatever the fuck.  That's him.  Macklemore.  Stop.  Stop with the other shit.  Fuck him.  Sing a cool song for the club and relax.  Yo, yo.  And CBS was scared of the gay kiss.  That makes me laugh hard.  Oh, my God. 
[00:44:00]  That Ringo thing is going to make me laugh all day.  We didn't talk about Imagine Dragons.  Radioactive.  I love that fucking song.  Weren't they performing with Kendrick Lamar?  Yeah, they were.  Yeah, they were.  Yeah.  He fucked up the song.  Of course he did.  He did.  Radioactive by those guys.  It's Imagine Dragons.  It's a great fucking song.  I love it.  You don't need to fucking do anything with it.  It is a great song. 
[00:44:30]  The Grammys are fucking needy or something.  They love doing it.  Why are they shoving everyone together?  Slap everyone together.  I guess, you know, it makes sense, but they forced it too much.  Yeah.  Sometimes that makes sense.  It's like, oh, that's kind of cool.  It's being touted by many.  It's the performance of the night.  All right.  Let me hear it.  Let me have an open mind here.  Oh, thank you.  Taylor Swift.  When 485 guys have done you wrong, guess what?  You might be the fucking problem.  Maybe it's her. 
[00:45:00]  Maybe it's her.  What is her issue?  I don't know.  Who is she fucking these days?  Who knows?  I don't remember.  You should know all the scoop.  You almost had an EW gig.  Almost.  It was your hard voice.  I think she's taking a break.  She's taking a break from getting her heart broken.  Oh, yeah.  From getting her heart broken.  I think she's taking a little break.  Is she waiting for the next time she's got to write an album?  Yeah.  So she'll get her heart broken.  She'll write that.  I heard she was going after like.  Are we extra critical today? 
[00:45:30]  Hollywood guy.  Oh, yeah.  A little extra critical today?  Yeah, but it's not like.  After these award shows, we always do.  It's not like nobody saw that coming.  It was an award show full of like music that's popular right now.  Yeah.  No, I like a lot of the songs that are out.  I really do.  I even enjoy a Beyonce song here and there.  I do.  Especially when hip hop was rewarded.  Yeah.  That would.  I mean, I would assume people who listen to this show would realize that.  But it's good that there's one place that's not saying Macklemore is the greatest thing 
[00:46:00]  that's ever come to music ever.  It's nice that somebody.  Everyone's buying that bullshit.  This might be a little the opposite extreme, but still, at least it's something different.  They're all buying his fucking horse shit.  Acceptance and fucking tolerance.  I don't think he has longevity.  Plus, he looks like Roger Klotz from Doug.  From Doug, right.  I don't think he has longevity.  Yeah.  He might squeeze out another year or two.  With only so much of that PC fucking shit anyone could stomach. 
[00:46:30]  That saccharine crap.  No, it's everything.  The second he opens his mouth, it's that.  And his fucking, what, what, last award show, it was the Trayvon shit.  Right.  And then, you know, he just moves on to this now.  And it's all bullshit.  Because the same people that are accepting Macklemore's song then go on Twitter and start  calling everyone a faggot and everything else.  Because it's okay when they do it.  It's okay when you throw your hate out there. 
[00:47:00]  Did he think he was gay when he was in third grade?  Third grade.  Yeah.  Yeah, because he could draw.  And if you could draw in the third grade, you're gay?  Well, that's what he thought.  The fuck is it?  What, are you sticking the crayon up your ass and fucking drawing with it that way?  No.  Come on.  Artistic, you know?  Oh.  And his uncle was gay.  See, but that's why he's trying way too hard.  He's like, okay, I gotta think of a time when I thought I was gay.  I gotta pull myself into this cause, yeah.  I gotta make it about me.  Well, there was a time I was with my crayons in third grade. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, I was artistic.  So I guess that means I thought I was gay back then.  Okay, good.  Now I can write this song.  He's making one of those, drawing one of those turkeys that he draws with his hand on the  paper and traces it.  He's so artistic.  Right.  But then he realized he liked girls and was good at Little League.  Oh, not gay.  Not gay.  This guy never thought he was gay.  That's my point.  He's such a bullshitter.  He is bullshit.  He's a liar.  You think his uncle's really gay?  I don't know. 
[00:48:00]  I have no idea.  I don't even give a fuck.  Right.  Who cares?  That's the bottom line there.  I just laughed at those poor couples that thought their big wedding moment was going to be huge  and over the top.  Yeah.  They were just, like you said earlier, a prop.  A prop.  And they shoved them into some horrible back room to have some horrible fucking 12-foot  hero together.  Their reception.  Right.  Right.  Everybody got a slice of hero.  I bet you they kicked them out of the fucking building before the thing was over even.  Thank you.  We just used you for Macklemore's bullshit. 
[00:48:30]  I bet Macklemore was told he would have this big dressing room and it turned out to be the  room they put the gay couples in after the wedding and he got all mad.  Right.  Get those motherfuckers out of my goddamn room.  There's no cameras, all right?  But Macklemore, they're the gay couples.  I could give a shit, yo.  Right.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Fuck him.  All right.  I like being tired for the radio show.  Our Grammy coverage.  It makes me a bit more ornery.  Ornery. 
[00:49:00]  Yes.  Travis, did we cover it all?  Yeah, I think you guys did a wonderful job.  I do still want to hear the Ozzy thing at some point.  I want to hear the Ozzy thing.  Hopefully we can find it.  We got to call Paul Williams still.  Yes, Paul.  We congratulate him.  Yeah.  Then maybe we'll play some of these songs going into break.  He was in here talking about them.  He was in here talking about them.  Yeah, what do you got?  I don't know.  What do you want?  I got stuff over here, too.  No, nothing from the Grammys.  Oh, you meant the nominated stuff?  Yeah, that mashup stuff sucked.  Terrible. 
[00:49:30]  Horrible stuff.  Terrible.  Terrible.  If you have the artists in the same room, don't you think it's like, oh, we could have  them perform by themselves any time.  Yeah.  Let's mash it up.  I mean, Stevie Wonder and fucking some other guys.  Stevie Wonder and motorcycle helmets.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm even saying it about Metallica.  I love Metallica.  I love that song, One.  When we saw it at the Apollo Theater, we lost our fucking minds.  We're like, we're this close to Metallica as they're playing one, but they didn't need  that piano bullshit.  Ling Ling.  It even says on Travis's Grammys news headline list, everyone really enjoyed the Kendrick 
[00:50:00]  Lamar and Imagine Dragons performance.  Oh, God.  I didn't enjoy it.  I can play something from Vampire Weekend.  They won Best Alternative.  Why don't you play some Kendrick Lamar?  I can play some Kendrick Lamar.  You like that guy?  Who, Kendrick?  Yeah.  He's great.  See, everybody likes him.  He's the shit right now.  Him and Drake.  Drake got fucked.  Why aren't we playing some Daft Punk?  They won everything.  We've heard it all.  We did.  But they won't.  Oh, fuck.  We forgot to talk about the girl guy. 
[00:50:30]  The girl guy.  Pink is a girl guy.  Yeah.  I think Pink confuses a lot of people.  Because you look at her one way, she's pretty good looking and broad.  And then you look at it another way, and she's a handsome man.  Right?  That is a very chiseled jawbone.  She's a girl guy.  And her body is, I know she's built like a gymnast, but there's...  Yeah, I don't know about her.  What's going on there, you think?  She's one of those girls that if you click her profile pic on Twitter, you might have to 
[00:51:00]  click twice to see if she's...  You know, you've got to get it up.  You've got to make it bigger.  And then you're like, oh, it looked good at a fucking microscope when it was on microfilm.  When it's a postage stand.  When it's that little, tiny fucking square on your phone.  Right.  That's funny.  And why is she doing the exact same thing she did last time?  She's done it like this the last five years.  All she does is perform in the fucking sky now.  Like Cirque du Soleil?  Yeah, it's enough of it already. 
[00:51:30]  It's impressive, but she didn't sing a note.  Yeah, she keeps doing it.  She lip-synced that whole fucking thing.  It's impressive every time.  I guess she's thinking, well, if I'm going to lip-sync, at least I'll try to perform for  these people instead of sit there like the rest of them and just make believe they were  singing.  I hope to see an Owen Hart thing happen there.  You'd like that?  Yeah, it would be hilarious.  She's spinning over the crowd.  I don't know.  Has she ever been tested for, I don't know.  Oh, like hormones?  A little, uh... 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  A little grab down below?  Yeah, what kind of...  A little grab?  Check the birth certificate.  What kind of DNA does she have?  What kind of chromosomes?  Yeah, Chandler.  Like a little Jamie Lee Curtis action.  Ah, yeah, hermaphrodite.  Has she ever had her chromosomes tested?  I don't know.  Hmm.  Yeah.  I think it's worth a test.  Meatloaf.  Oh, yeah.  Next, but first this for a little bit.  There we go.  Welcome back to the show, Meatloaf. 
[00:52:30]  Take a seat, my friend.  What's going on, brother?  You need a no-in telling people go this way, and so I go that way, and they go, no, not  you.  Oh, no, Meatloaf.  You, my God.  What do you want?  You can do whatever you want.  Creamed corn?  I'll eat some creamed corn with you.  You always have tuna and creamed corn in the morning.  Creamed corn and tuna?  No, you don't eat creamed corn in the morning?  Not in the morning.  I've had tuna in the morning.  That's not too bad.  Tuna on toast.  That's the breakfast of rock and roll, people.  Creamed corn.  Why creamed corn?  Never creamed corn, though, in the morning. 
[00:53:00]  Creamed corn stinks.  Yeah, creamed corn.  That seems like corn, too, out of the can.  Just don't make it up.  Oh, wow.  But isn't it like gelatinous?  It's a little coagulated at the cold temperatures.  Have I yelled at you guys for yelling at me?  Yeah, I did, I think.  Well, well, we yelled at you.  Yeah, a couple of years ago.  Oh, man.  No, we had a good time with you a couple of years ago.  No, I don't mind.  Time before, I think.  I think I can pull it up online.  Oh, no.  What did we say?  What did we do?  Was it bad?  Yeah, it was bad.  It was bad.  Shit.  Were you here?  No, I wasn't here.  I think it's because I wasn't here is the reason you were doing it. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  If you were here, we don't say anything.  No, no.  When I'm here, you're nice.  Yeah, yeah.  I like that.  Just behind the back, you guys.  Go after people.  Oh, no.  This could be a real thing today.  What did we say?  Wait, what did we say?  Let's get into this.  I don't care.  You're talking about...  The documentary you did?  No.  I would have made fun of that, too.  I was amazed by that.  I would have made fun of that.  See, that's where me and you differ.  But, no, you really opened up during that. 
[00:54:00]  You didn't have to show everybody your issues.  Well, you know what?  You know what?  When I'm...  It's...  I don't want to bring him up, but I'm going to, because you brought that up.  That guy's Sherman from the...  It's a Sherman, right.  Yeah.  Well, people don't understand about going to the zone.  And I don't think they understand about what...  How football players, at that level...  I mean, that's a major... 
[00:54:30]  I don't think people understand how fast that is, how gruel...  I mean, you...  I don't think there is a person that doesn't play that game that could stand on that field  and have one of those guys half hit him and not just lay there for about two days.  Right.  And so, to get to that point, how absolutely in your mind, how almost...  You have to almost become a monster to play at that level.  Yeah.  And people don't get that.  I understand going to the zone, because that's where I was going. 
[00:55:00]  When cameras are rolling, like when I'm doing a film, and we're rehearsing, I know where  the cameras are.  When they yell action, all the crew...  They're gone.  I mean, they're just gone.  They're in the zone.  I'm in the zone.  They're gone.  There's nobody in existence except me and that actor or the two actors or whatever we're  in.  And so, that's the same thing, you know, in that documentary that was.  When that camera was there, I didn't know it was there.  Right.  It was kind of like Celebrity Prentice. 
[00:55:30]  Well, I should have known that one was there.  Anyway, oh, my.  We won't talk about that too much, if at all.  I just want to say, none of us here had a problem with what Richard Sherman said.  Oh, no, that's good.  Because we totally got that.  He was in the zone.  Just made an amazing play to get his team into the fucking Super Bowl.  Yeah.  That wasn't an easy play.  You've got to understand, all the circumstances, it was like one, you know, a quarter inch maybe.  That ball, crap, you would have caught that ball. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  And they would have been the Super Bowl.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I...  And so, I'm glad you didn't have any problem with it.  I just got a note.  Oh, boy.  Meatloaf, you canceled on us once.  I know, but I didn't...  Oh, and Jim, who's not here, thank God.  So, it wasn't me and Anthony, officially.  Oh, good.  Officially.  Jimmy Norton.  I'm going to throw Jimmy out of the bus.  Yeah, please do.  He's interviewing Ozzy today.  For real.  But Jim was really upset that you canceled on us.  Let's just put it that way.  Let me just...  I don't know.  Why did he cancel, though?  Does anyone know?  Because I didn't come to town.  Oh. 
[00:56:30]  Oh.  That's a good reason.  Awkward.  You're not here.  Awkward.  Oh.  Like they had some issue.  We couldn't get to town.  Because it was snowing or something?  Something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not like, you know, I missed on purpose.  Yeah.  It just didn't happen.  All right.  I think we got that squared.  Yeah.  We're good now.  Now we know it's Jim.  We're good.  Just throw Jimmy under the bus.  Where is he?  He's really interviewing Ozzy Osbourne today.  Yeah, but where?  Yeah, where is that?  I guess L.A.  L.A.  Oh, he's in L.A.  Okay.  You ever meet Ozzy? 
[00:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  I know Ozzy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A long time.  Yeah.  Yeah, back in the 70s.  Oh, wow.  So you knew that Ozzy.  Yeah, I knew the Ozzy in the 80s, too.  Wow.  Yeah.  Which was even different than Ozzy in the 70s.  Yeah, Ozzy kind of changed by the decade.  Because the drugs changed, right?  Yeah.  Probably.  Probably a little.  I think Ozzy remembers the 70s.  I'm not sure about the 80s, though.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, that could have been a little rough to remember.  Did you ever do the drug years, Milo?  No.  Not really?  I write it.  Yeah, I mean, I always read somewhere the other day, well, you know, lately he's had 
[00:57:30]  the Kansas show due to drugs and illness.  I'm going, what the hell are you?  I really want to call my lawyer and send him a letter.  Go, you better take this sucker out, dude.  Right.  Because you're barking up the wrong tree here, because I don't do drugs.  Don't want to give you a bad reputation like that, too.  No, that's not fair.  People read it.  That's really not fair, because it's like, you know, they get on that, what is that thing,  Wikipedia thing.  And if you listen to that, I'm a diabetic, which I'm not.  Right.  Oh, give me a break. 
[00:58:00]  I mean, the Diabetes Association just called me the other day and go, we want you to help  us with our ad campaign.  That's a true story.  And I said, I don't think I'm the one you want.  Well, you have type 2 diabetes, don't you?  And I went, no.  No.  And they go, well, it says you do.  Yeah.  It says.  And I said, well, you can't believe everything you read, dude.  Yeah.  I said, I'll do it for you, but I don't think you want somebody to go around and lie for  you.  They go, no, that wouldn't be good.  I said, no, that wouldn't be good at all.  There's a lot of shit out there.  How do you deal with that? 
[00:58:30]  You just kind of, well, you try to ignore it now, don't you?  I'm sure you guys get a, get your dad share of bullshit.  Yeah, from our own fans.  You're like, wait, you're actually a fan of the show?  Can you explain?  Yeah, no kidding.  It's ugly out there.  It's ugly.  There's so much bullshit out there nowadays.  Yeah, I mean, people used to have an opinion, you know, and they might, you know, tell their  next door neighbor, well, we went to see this movie.  What'd you, did you like it?  Nah, I didn't like it very much.  And that's as far as it went.  That's, yeah, yeah.  You know, or they, you know, they might have had an argument with some guy and gone to 
[00:59:00]  their neighbor and said, you know, amused all the, but then it was gone.  Yeah.  I mean, the neighbor didn't chirp in with them and go and say, oh yeah, that movie sucked  even though they didn't see it, you know?  And that's what happens.  Right.  They got this.  Now everyone has a voice.  Yeah, and they got this sheep mentality.  They got this gang mentality going on.  Even if you didn't see it, you'll join in going, yeah, they sucked.  That's so true.  Yeah, I mean, you know, the people didn't even talk about some movie, you know, and they  didn't see it. 
[00:59:30]  Well, I didn't see it, but I saw his last one.  It sucked too.  Yeah, yeah.  We're kind of guilty of it because we just beat the shit out of the Grammys for the last  hour and a half.  We saw it.  But I mean, we're trying to, we're trying to at least come up with some jokes and we're  trying to at least whether they were funny or not.  I mean, I didn't watch it because I started reading about what was going to go on.  Yeah.  And I just went.  You just don't watch the Grammys anymore?  No.  Wow.  Well, I looked at the, before the Grammys came on, USA Today had pictures of people coming  to the Grammys.  I almost had 50 of them.  Yeah.  I knew one person.  Oh shit. 
[01:00:00]  I'm going, who are these people?  Oh God, I'm old.  And so then I started reading about, I mean, I knew everybody was performing Beyonce, Ringo  Starr, McCartney, Dave Grohl.  I don't know who else was on there, but you know, I like, I love Dave Grohl, so I'm sure  he was good.  So there you go.  See, I didn't see it, but I'm assuming he was good.  See, he just, he just did what he said.  He was good.  He was good.  But there's people out there going, Dave Grohl sucked last night, didn't he?  Yeah.  You know, I've seen, I love Dave Grohl.  So I, I'm assuming he was good.  He's a good guy too.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a great guy.  He's a solid guy.  Oh, he's unbelievable. 
[01:00:30]  And when did you win your Grammy?  You won one?  Ages ago.  Yeah, one, they don't like me.  I, you know, they, I'm not a, I, I, I, I never been, in the music, in the music, I've  kind of been like, like a leper on a, on an island, you know, I've been put over to  leprosy island.  And in the acting career, I have a lot more respect over in the acting career for the music  and for the acting, which is very interesting.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  The music community kind of like, hmm, yeah, meatloaf.  Yeah, well, I read the other day they were, they were picking something, the 10 greatest  love songs and anything for love was there.  And, and they go, and the people who were writing go, oh, I don't know why this is in  here, I don't like this, and I don't know anybody that does.  Nice.  Jeez.  And you gotta read that shit.  Oh, I didn't even, I didn't even need to.  Yeah, yeah.  It just popped in my face. 
[01:01:30]  And I'm going, I almost, I was going, I'm going to call that guy.  No, I went, no, just let it go.  It's like, that's the guy that'll talk for everybody, right?  Yeah.  And if I don't like it, then of course no one likes it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's exactly right.  I think that song is 20 years old now, Mevo.  It is 20 years old.  Holy shit.  I'll do anything for love is 20 years old.  Yeah, it was crazy.  I was thinking that last night.  I'm going, wow.  That's when you won the Grammy too, 1994.  That's when we started doing radio together, when that song came out.  Damn.  So you've had a good run.  Pretty good run.  Not too shamby. 
[01:02:00]  Not bad.  No, the Grammys you're talking about, it's like I was reading about what was going to  happen and they, did you watch it?  Oh, yeah.  The whole thing.  Just to goof on it.  Well, they left you wide open there for a couple of things.  I'm telling you, they had, they were going weddings.  Yeah, the gay wedding was going on.  Was it there more than just the gay wedding?  No, there were a couple of straight people in there.  No, but it was, I think it was really forced and quick. 
[01:02:30]  It felt like a, it felt like a morning zoo type of a bit, if you understand radio.  Oh, that's exactly, you know what, that's exactly how I looked at it.  Oh, good.  Yeah, yeah.  It was so forced and over the top.  Our stance on this show, we don't care.  We don't care who you matter.  We don't give a shit.  Exactly.  We do care when it's being forced down your face.  Like it was uncomfortable because it just didn't work.  Well, forced down people's face.  It's also, when you're talking about a performance, there's also comes, that comes forcing.  So I have a feeling it was forced on both sides. 
[01:03:00]  It was forced into the, you know, it's like, I don't think that's an arena.  I never thought music was an arena for politics.  I mean, no, it's agree with me.  John Baez, obviously.  Right.  You know, a few other people.  A little Bono, maybe from you too.  He likes to talk about some issues.  Yeah.  Look at the people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One of the greatest Bono jokes was, he was on stage in Scotland and he was ripping something  up and he said to the audience, every time I do this, another child is injured or killed. 
[01:03:30]  And some guy from the audience screamed out, well, stop doing it.  I've heard that.  I always just get mad because I'm a big U2 fan.  And then when Bono starts babbling, I'm like, man, he could be doing like Angel of Harlem  or something.  Yeah.  I don't know why people put such credence in what these people say just because they.  The problem is they don't.  I don't, I don't, you know, I believe, you know, you got, U2 plays stadiums. 
[01:04:00]  So we're talking about over 50,000 people.  Yeah.  Let's say they got 50,000 people.  50,000 people, how about you say 80?  Oh, well, I was just doing it because it's easy math.  Let's say 100.  Let's say sometimes 100.  Okay.  It's a little harder math, but I can handle that.  80,000 people.  Easily.  And maybe 10% want to know what he's saying.  So he's leaving out, he's excluding, I really believe, 72,000 people.  That's about right.  I bet you it's even less than 10%. 
[01:04:30]  Well, I'm giving him benefit of the doubt here.  But you're right.  And I don't, I don't think they want Madonna preaching politics.  I don't think, you know, if you go play for somebody or you do something for somebody,  like I walked the streets of New York and 60 and 72 for McGovern.  You won one state.  Wow.  And then I did it again for Carter.  Right.  And everybody thinks I'm a Republican.  Oh, man, you people have no idea.  And then again, when Reagan ran the first term, I can't remember who his opponent was, but I was out for him too. 
[01:05:00]  I went to Carter inaugural, actually.  They didn't know who I was, but I was there.  How did they not know who you were?  Well, it was 78.  I mean, they kind of did.  I mean, I got invited to go to the Georgia ball.  Okay.  So he knew, I guess, somehow.  But it wasn't like now.  I mean, if I go somewhere now, I go to the grocery store, you know, I got to take pictures with me.  But I try to stay grounded.  So I go to the grocery store, I pump my own gas.  But when I go to the grocery store, it's really weird being in the soup section and somebody wants you to have a picture with you. 
[01:05:30]  You know.  Hey, what are you doing here?  I'm getting soup.  What do you think I'm doing?  I'm doing what you're doing.  I got to eat.  I gots to eat.  But Macklemore, they married, like, how many couples?  30, 40, maybe?  Whatever.  And then CBS panicked because, you know, they don't want the gays kissing on their network.  So they, like, cut away quickly.  Yeah, they said, I now pronounce you.  You know what I'm kissing?  Why did they put it on TV?  It was funny, though.  They couldn't get off them fast enough when they realized, uh-oh, here comes the kissing.  If you're going to go in, you've got to go all in, right?  But, you know, network television, they're like, well, let's make it seem like we want to do this. 
[01:06:00]  But then we'll cut off the kissing part.  That's like, come on.  Because that might offend middle America.  Yeah, if you're going to say I'm going in, go all in.  Yeah, yeah.  And if I'd have been the director out of the state on that kiss forever.  Just, yeah, yeah, zoom in on it.  Kiss him again!  Right.  Just knowing it's bothering someone.  Was it two men or two women?  There were a bunch of them, yeah.  Oh, I would have panned all the kissing.  It was kind of odd.  They even had straight couples.  I saw one couple that I thought was a straight couple, but it was two women. 
[01:06:30]  But the girl, one of the girls looked like a guy.  Right.  It's just amazing.  But at that point, why wouldn't you just, I don't know.  I don't know.  Why wouldn't you just get a guy at that point?  I don't know.  It doesn't make sense.  If I was a lesbian, I'd want one of those, you know, voluptuous, lipstick lesbians.  Lipstick lesbians?  If I'm a lesbian, why would I?  That's why you're a guy and not a lesbian.  Why would I get a woman that looks like Bob?  I don't know how that works.  It's very confusing to me.  So anyway, did you guys know I'm playing Vegas?  Yes.  Just to switch the subject? 
[01:07:00]  Well, this is huge.  I'm already hearing you've got to go in five minutes, so we better talk about this.  I had a feeling we might be running.  We were having a good time.  Are you up?  Anytime I have a good time, I know it's time to go.  Time to go.  Are you up?  If I always have a good time, get him out of there.  You're doing a lot of promoting today?  Yep.  All over the place, but it's, you're doing one of those residencies.  Yeah, we did it in.  You're all right with that?  Milo, if you seem like the type of guy, I don't know you that well, but where you need to be moving  around to different places.  No, not anymore, dude.  Not anymore.  No, I, people, that's another thing. 
[01:07:30]  Last year, we did a big European tour, and it was all sold out.  It was called The Last at Bat, and we did Bat at Hell in sequence as a second act.  We did, you know, other hits in the first act, and then Bat at Hell in sequence, which  turned out to be a spectacular concert.  I mean, for us to get 25 out of 27 reviewers to give us a good review is saying something  happened, and then we got 25 great ones, one mixed, but one didn't like it. 
[01:08:00]  That last asshole, wouldn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  So, that's always one in every group, you know?  What can you tell?  It has to be different just to be different.  Bat at a hell.  No one even bought that album.  Yeah, he probably liked it.  The sad part is he probably liked it, but he has to be that guy.  Oh, there are those guys.  There's one in Vegas like that, but when he came to see the show, people told me, this  is the best review I've seen him write in 10 years.  He usually hates everything.  I mean, he just kills everything, and he didn't.  He gave us quotes. 
[01:08:30]  He gave us, it's not a nonstop moment in the show, a hoot, fun, you know, it's like, and  that's what it is.  That's what it's supposed to be.  You still wearing the wig?  No.  Oh, hell no.  Man, I'm telling you.  No, it was a big, he knows it was a big part of the documentary.  I don't know what, I have no idea what possessed me to do that.  They killed you for wearing the wig to try to look younger, because the broad was younger.  Oh, no, that wasn't it at all.  It was, I was just going back to 78.  I just wanted to look from when the song was big. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, trying to be younger.  See, what they assume, you know what assume does, don't you?  Oh, yeah.  Makes an ass out of them.  Out of them.  So it's a Las Vegas residency at Planet Hollywood starting February 13th.  It's a really good show.  I mean, I put it, you know, I went and pitched it like you would a TV show.  And, well, they wanted me to do it.  But they had their ideas of how they wanted the show to go.  And I didn't, I went, come on, man, who's thinking this stuff up? 
[01:09:30]  And so I put one together and went out and they said, and they didn't, they weren't getting how I was, what I was doing with one manager talking to somebody else and going there.  So I flew out and I sit down with them for two days.  I pitched the first 35 minutes in one day.  It took me four hours.  Oh, I was in depth.  They were sitting at me looking like this.  You can't see it because we're not on TV, but their mouths were just hanging open.  Yeah.  It took you four hours to explain the first 35 minutes of the show?  Yeah.  So what's going on in the 35 minutes? 
[01:10:00]  I'm not going to tell you because it'll take us four hours.  Well, that's true.  What's the gist?  Oh, it's just.  Is it more than just you?  Oh, it's a lot more.  Yeah.  Okay.  There's, I mean, I got all kinds of gags and tricks and, and, and, uh, I, I, I do get, I do characters and my wife said, you're going over people's head.  So this time I got to not do it.  I mean, I opened the show with a character from 1972 for a play I did with Joe Papp called rabbit.  And that's how, that's where I met Steinman.  And, uh, so, uh, I, I opened with that and he talks like this. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  You can't, no, I, I can't have you applaud now because, oh my, you know, I'm not, I know this is Las Vegas, but I, I just haven't, I haven't, uh, oh no, this is just horrible.  Do people think you've lost your mind?  No, they think that's me.  So I go on and I make fun of Cirque du Soleil and I, oh, wow.  Okay.  So I do like 15 minutes of standup at that point.  Right.  And then, and I have gags going on behind me and then we go in and I have a huge production number and, um, it just keeps going. 
[01:11:00]  And we were supposed to do 85 minutes and they had a show following us every night at nine o'clock.  We were going on seven 30.  Well, I kept telling to them, guys, you got to understand, you better push the show to nine 30.  This was before we started.  I said, I really don't know how to do an hour and a half hour and a half.  This doesn't, it, I just start getting warmed up at that time.  Um, and, and they go, well, you got to cut, we got a show coming in. 
[01:11:30]  So we, uh, we ran up one night, seven minutes before their show was supposed to start.  Oops.  But the cast was fine.  The producers were yelling at me.  Of course.  Your, your people are patting.  I'm not done yet.  They got their coats on.  I'm not done yet.  Turn around.  Look what they look like.  I'm in Vegas.  February, I just wanted to know, cause sometimes we get in trouble for keeping you guys.  Yeah, I know, but you know, this is all meatloaf.  Yeah.  You don't get, you can't get in trouble.  I'm it's on me.  I can't even see your face.  She is, she is ready to go. 
[01:12:00]  And anyway, I got to go, but listen, it was fun guys.  And it was nice to see you.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  And next time I'll come when I can talk more.  Yes.  And, uh, when you're having fun, it won't be time to leave.  Right.  That's right.  But it's, uh, Planet Hollywood starting February 13th.  Were you going to ask me any questions at all?  About what?  Oh, I didn't know.  I thought maybe, you know, we were just getting started to be honest with you for all your  whole show.  We could have easily done another hour with you.  Yeah.  But every night you're going to be at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas starting February 13th.  Yeah, that's the same building with Brittany, me, and now the Jacksons are coming in the 
[01:12:30]  week after.  So do you guys all get to hang out?  I hung out with the Jacksons, came to see my show.  So yeah, I hung out with them.  Not Brittany though.  Uh, you know, I met Brittany when she was 16 in England at the, at the lottery show  with her mother.  Right.  Do tell.  No.  No.  Nah, it's okay.  All right, me, love.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, man.  All right, see you next time.  I don't know.  It's just our thoughts on what happened. 
[01:13:00]  It's our post.  It's our post interview.  Our wrap up.  We found the clip that he was talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was glad that I fucking hate the internet, man.  I know.  Right.  Fucking assholes people.  And I know it was, wasn't meatloaf listening or someone was like, Hey, meatloaf, look what  they said about you.  There's a bunch of rats out there.  A bunch of fucking rats.  Lots of rats.  Well, if he Googles himself at all.  This clip is called Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Meatloaf cancels. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Jimmy attacks.  Okay.  So we were going to throw Jimmy under the bus no matter what, because that's just what  you got to do to save your own ass.  Right.  But it turns out that it actually was Jimmy.  Yeah.  For the most part.  Although it may have gotten awkward if you played the clips.  Why?  There's just a lot of, a lot of harshness.  Well, meatloaf called us out and said we said some bad things about him.  We said it was Jimmy, even though we didn't know at the time.  That's the truth.  And now you found the actual clip.  Yeah.  So let's listen to this a little bit. 
[01:14:00]  How bad was it?  How bad could it be?  How bad could it be?  It's you guys.  How bad could it be?  Right.  Yeah.  We're lovable.  In the end, we're very lovable.  Yeah.  I mean, no matter what you say, I'm sure it was with charm.  That's right.  He asked us if we want meatloaf.  So what happened between us saying, yes, we want meatloaf, and today where he's not coming  on the show?  He probably, see, the thing is, originally I didn't fault him.  I'm like, you know what?  It happens.  The artist doesn't always get the message.  But now I know the managers and stuff know that we have been promoting this and all that 
[01:14:30]  stuff, and they're still douching us, and he's not coming on.  So that's why I feel comfortable attacking him as well, because he could have come on,  and he just doesn't want to.  He wants to probably stay in bed, and instead of coming on and promoting his completely average  documentary.  We'll screw him.  This is not exactly Katrina you're covering.  Why is his documentary average?  That's wonderful, because I didn't even bother watching it. 
[01:15:00]  Why would you?  I don't know, because it's about a man in his late 50s.  Yeah.  This is the whole thing.  It's about him on tour, and, you know, 2007, because we've all wanted to know, what  is Meatloaf like on tour?  And it's about him, because he does Paradise by the Dashboard Lights, and he acts it out.  Well, yeah.  He acts it out on stage with a much younger dancer, a singer, who's actually, she's a  very good singer, in fairness to her. 
[01:15:30]  Her name is Aspen.  How much money did that cost him?  Believe me, it had to be a lot.  $80,000 over the course of 10 years, I believe.  The critics brutalized him on how awful it looked, and she looked like a little kid,  and he just looked gross.  It's so funny just to watch this fat idiot falling apart at the seams, trying to act like  the critic reviews don't bother him, and then he's like, the big mystery is, what's he going  to do?  Is he going to fix it?  How is he going to fix it?  Because he has eight shows before they film the DVD. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, no.  Now what does he do?  Eat?  I'll tell you what he does.  Here's the big, save yourself the money.  He decides to put on the wig like the old days, and then make it like it's a retro.  Oh, no, he doesn't.  Yeah.  So that's what this guy does.  He puts on a wig, and the whole Meat Loaf band has to go out there in Halloween costumes  and pretend it's the 70s.  And so he's kind of like reenacting the video.  You remember the famous video of him and the Tuxedo? 
[01:16:30]  Oh, of course.  Who could forget?  Yeah, it was just a moment.  And the best part of this is if Meat Loaf came in, none of this would have been said.  None of it.  They would have been talked about like, wow, I really like the documentary, and the wig  thing might have been a little weird, but maybe you can explain that.  If someone does this wrong, man, you just turn.  We all fucking chimed in, though.  Right.  You knew not so much.  I'm right on board with Jimmy. 
[01:17:00]  You were asking leading questions.  Well, that's kind of one of my fucking talents here.  I'm right in there with Jimmy.  Yeah, fuck him.  What did you eat?  I didn't see the documentary at that point.  That was 2007, I guess.  But then, because of the whole Meat Loaf fiasco, I went and saw the documentary, and I actually  did like it a lot.  Yeah.  Because he was nuts.  Is that the girl that he does act with?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And they did a whole thing.  Like, all the reviews were talking about him and his wig.  His long wig that he had. 
[01:17:30]  Trying to look younger.  And I truly believe he was trying to look younger.  Yeah.  But then he spun and said, nah, man, I was going for a retro thing.  Nah, retro.  It's kind of funny.  Right.  No, he probably was going for the...  You want to hear a little more of this?  Oh, sure.  It's not that bad.  Yeah, because we haven't gotten to the part where Jim goes over the questions he's prepared  and then redoes them.  Oh, great.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Reenact that.  And then there's one point where they can't do the kissing.  It's just too disgusting.  Yeah.  He has to just put his arm around her.  They both have to stand there and look at the screen. 
[01:18:00]  It's horrendous.  Oh, wow.  That's what your idea of compromising and making this palatable to critics is?  Maybe that's why he's not coming on the show today because the reviews are just getting  really bad and he's embarrassed.  Well, that was the live show.  Who knows?  I don't even know what the reviews of the documentary are.  But he was a real dick to the guys who were filming him.  It was really...  I had a bunch of questions for him.  I was so annoyed.  Yeah.  Questions.  I see a whole list of questions for Meat Loaf, Jimmy.  Yes.  What's on that sheet?  Well, I may have allowed it to annoy me a little bit, so forgive me. 
[01:18:30]  Okay.  But I felt, why can't I ask my Meat Loaf questions?  Yeah.  I had 10 questions I was going to ask Meat Loaf, but I amended them slightly when my mood  altered.  Oh, okay.  The original one question was, was it uncomfortable being filmed?  You seemed to have a terse relationship with the camera crew.  Okay.  I changed that a little bit.  Why were you such an incredible douche to the poor slob who drew the short straw and  got stuck filming you? 
[01:19:00]  That might have been my bitterness creeping in.  I don't know.  The next question was, I was amazed at how hands-on you were with the stage production.  Has experience taught you that the only way to get things done is to pay close attention  to every detail?  Oh, very nice.  That's a good question.  Yeah.  I kind of amended it, though.  What bothers you more?  The fact that you're a monumentally charmless control freak, or the fact that all your attention  and focus adds up to mediocrity? 
[01:19:30]  My God.  Jesus Christ.  And this is the thing.  This is kind of charming.  He goes on stage with a jersey of the local sports team every time he goes into that.  In every city you play, and I noticed you wore the jersey of the local team.  You a big sports fan?  That was the question he was going to get.  And the 3A would be, have you always resorted to such groveling, wormy tactics to win over  an audience, or just since you lost your voice?  Oh, wow. 
[01:20:00]  Holy shit.  This is bad.  Yeah.  What?  Oh, Jimmy.  But you see where it's coming from, and it wasn't us.  We were egging him on a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  You're saying it's Jim.  I found it funny.  Yeah, we're good with Meatloaf.  Wow.  We're good.  So Meatloaf listened to this.  Right.  That's what he said.  He listened to this.  Oh, I wouldn't like that at all.  You wouldn't?  No, I would be like, I'd come in and be like, oh, these guys are assholes.  Right.  That's the same story as Bobby Moynihan, going home and being like, oh, I love ONA. 
[01:20:30]  Let me look up some ONA.  Oh, they're talking about me.  And then it just.  Well, he's got a drunk uncle thing.  Come on.  It's not working.  What is he doing?  He's on SNL.  He's a big star.  What is he doing on that SNL?  He's in like almost every skit.  Doing what?  All kinds of characters.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Want to hear just a little more?  Or are we good?  It doesn't matter either way.  No?  No.  We do have other things to talk about.  Yeah.  I just want to make sure that we had nothing to do with this.  I think we're in the clear. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  I don't want to go home, you know, thinking I lied to Meatloaf.  Yeah.  No.  How could you sleep?  It was all Jimmy.  Oh, wait a minute.  Let's say hi to.  Uh, let's say hi.  Can you put the fucking phone on hold?  Oh, my God.  No reason to have a conversation.  Someone has made the writing on the phone thing so tiny now that with my new tiny monitor,  it is literally impossible to read.  We could fix that for you. 
[01:21:30]  Look at, look at, look at, dude, look, take a look.  It's literally, like, it might as well be another language.  That's that line in, uh.  It was working, um.  The eye doctor's office.  Yes, yeah, yeah.  No one reads.  I can't read that.  Let's say hi to Dutch in Connecticut.  What's up, Dutch?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  Meatloaf lives in my town in Connecticut.  Okay, congrats. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's really helping our property value.  He, uh, I ran into him in the supermarket, and, you know, of all things, he was literally  in the meat aisle, and I just stopped and looked at him, and I laughed.  I'm like, hey, man, that's really ironic.  And he looked at me and said, you're shopping for meat.  And he flipped out, and, just leave me alone, and he pushed his cart away, and started out  of the store.  I tend to believe that.  That's all I got to say.  He was extremely nice today.  Uh, yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Very nice and accommodating.  So, all right.  Yeah.  He's probably just goofing.  You think?  Yeah, Meatloaf just running away from somebody for saying, hey, you're buying meat.  He's an interesting character.  Imagine having to listen to four hours of him explaining the first 35 minutes of his  Vegas show.  Oh, my God.  I wouldn't have been able to take that.  But now I want to go see it.  I thought he was just going up there singing some, you know, stop right there stuff.  You think it's cheesy?  Uh, yeah, well, it's got to be.  A lot of visual elements and everything. 
[01:23:00]  It's got to be to a point, because it is Vegas.  Yeah.  They like to cheese things up a bit.  They do.  Just a little bit, so.  All right, I guess we're done with the Jim Norton questions thing.  Yeah, yeah, I guess so.  Why not?  Why not?  We can move on to other things.  Yeah.  Ah.  We got a shit ship.  Another shit ship.  I was so close to pulling the trigger on a cruise this year.  Yeah?  Just with the little ones, I just thought it'd be a lot easier just to get on a cruise ship 
[01:23:30]  instead of dealing with flying or something.  Like a Disney one or?  Yeah, any of these, you know?  And, uh, actually, my in-laws just got back from a cruise.  They absolutely fucking love it.  Yeah, they are a lot of fun.  You loved it.  You loved yours.  You've gone on a few the last few years.  I've been on a few cruises.  And Royal Caribbean's a good one, right?  Yeah.  Where's E-Roc?  He knows this shit.  Oh, E-Roc is like a fucking diamond member.  He knows the ins and outs of cruise shipping.  Yep.  I want to ask him if he's ever been on a shit ship. 
[01:24:00]  The shit ship.  What happens with these shit ships?  Somebody gets something.  Right.  Of a virus.  A fucking diarrhea-puking fucking virus.  Right.  And the ship is so, such close quarters, a little microcosm of life, that everybody winds  up getting it.  They touch, you know, you're touching doorknobs.  You touch fucking something on the stair railing, the elevator buttons.  My in-laws just, like I said, came back from a cruise, and two of the people they went 
[01:24:30]  with were quarantined for two days.  Oh, the quarantine.  They weren't allowed to leave their rooms.  What's that about, E-Roc?  Have you been on a shit ship?  No, I've never been on one of those cruises where that has happened.  Right.  You're lucked out.  Yeah.  So your luck's going to run out.  Because it seems like this happens.  No, it seems like this happens quite often.  I don't think it's all that much.  I don't think it's that much.  Can we get a couple a year?  Yeah, but the odds of actually being on a shit ship, it's pretty slim.  And every hallway, every elevator, near all the dining rooms, all have those Purell machines 
[01:25:00]  everywhere.  They've added that to, like, everywhere.  And they have signs, use it.  Use that.  Yeah.  Because we don't want this to be a shit ship.  A shit ship.  Remember the one where the bathrooms weren't working, and they were just leaving their duty  in the hall?  They're overflowing the bathrooms.  Was it the Carnival one last year, or a couple years ago now?  Carnival had two or three within the summer.  Yeah.  Right.  One was with the shit and the power going out.  Another was with the power going half out, and it still had to be towed into. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Didn't they explain how, like, the shit water was, like, was...  It was coming through the walls.  Yeah, sloshing around the hallways and stuff.  Because there was no power to operate the sewage system.  So it would sit in the wall, and then just, if it couldn't function through it, it would  just come back up.  Oh, my God.  Like, through the sink, the toilet.  It would go up the sink, the showers.  Right.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that's got to be horrible, being a sequestered shit ship.  Don't let it discourage you.  And Royal Caribbean's a good one, right? 
[01:26:00]  It's a very good one.  So why is it a shit ship?  What happened?  Bad food, or was it just someone got sick?  I think someone just got sick, and it spread.  We got the story.  I want to hear this quickly.  That's what happens.  Mm-hmm.  And looked at everyone and said,  Another cruise ship, cutting short its planned Caribbean island hopping,  and a maritime version of the Walk of Shame.  What?  This one, Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas.  Is that a good one?  Now heading back to Homeboard after hundreds of passengers and crew members fell ill 
[01:26:30]  due to a fast-spreading virus whose origins remain a mystery.  Mm-hmm.  One passenger, Arne Dodd, said her gastrointestinal symptoms came on suddenly.  It was vomiting and diarrhea.  It almost had no warning.  Oh.  It was like high fevers, pills, age, dehydration.  Oh, loose bowels.  Explosive.  Yeah, she's in the pool.  By the next morning, she says the infirmary was packed with six passengers.  As soon as I got down there, the nurse walked out and looked at everyone and said, 
[01:27:00]  if you're not sick, you have to leave right now, because this is spreading faster than  we can convey.  Like wildfire?  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still investigating why so many passengers  got sick.  But the typical cause is norovirus.  You have all those people in a confined space over a long period of time, and this is an easily  transmissible virus.  This guy loves, he loves, he loves, his cruise ship scenario has happened before. 
[01:27:30]  We were here with him two years ago.  He rolls up his sleeves and gets right in there.  The ship was overrun with this sickness.  Last year, according to the CDC, nine cruise ships reported illnesses among passengers.  That's a lot.  The year before that, 16.  That's a lot.  The Caribbean said in a statement that once docked, the ship underwent an extensive and  thorough sanitizing.  They were sanitizing the hallway.  I mean, they did ceiling to floor nonstop for about 24 hours. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, boy.  And infected passengers and crew were advised to stay in their cabins until they were well  for at least 24 hours.  Now, you can go on the CDC website and see the ratings, the scores for various health  inspections that are done regularly on cruise ships.  And actually, Explorer of the Seas did very, very well.  But that just goes to show you, no matter how clean the ship is, if a sick person, passenger,  or crew member walks on, many times there's not much that can be done.  There's people that is.  Iraq, I know what you're talking about. 
[01:28:30]  There's people that aren't wiping properly.  Exactly.  And then they shake your hand.  That's right.  Or they touch the salad bar or something.  Oh, they fucking, there's so many.  Oh, you're from Baltimore?  I'm from Baltimore.  Let's shake on that.  It's not even the Baltimore.  It's the people that are there from fucking Europe and fucking Africa.  Or they use the pools as their shower.  Yeah, yeah.  They come back to the beach.  They're a filthy people.  And they just jump in the pool thinking, all right, I'm good.  Now, let's go to dinner.  Right.  Guilty.  Of course it's you.  Oh, my God.  Guilty.  Oh, my God.  I don't like showering on vacation. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, my God.  Chlorine is a wonderful thing.  And it really makes it look like you have more hair than you do.  It's nice.  Fluffs it up a bit.  Fluffs up that.  I've been known to wash out my crack, you know, in a good fucking...  Oh, God.  In a good pool.  Just spreading the fucking sickness.  I have no problem.  Did I tell you when I went to Turks and Caicos last time?  You shit on the beach?  No. 
[01:29:30]  That's the Outer Banks.  Keep it straight.  A pool, though.  My...  Ah, man.  This is bad.  Oh, no.  Fuck.  Oh, no.  My young son.  He was just under two at the time.  And he vomited in the pool.  Bad.  Jesus.  Ugh.  Bad.  And that's like...  I guess that's like...  You know, they shut down pools for that shit.  Yeah, they do.  You have to drain the whole thing, right?  And I'm like, what the fuck am I...  Here it is. 
[01:30:00]  And I saw all these people enjoying themselves, and I'm like, I can't tell anyone.  I can't tell anyone.  So what...  Because it's going to ruin, like, the rest of our week.  You just...  So I was trying to figure out what to do, and it was like, kind of...  It started out as a big, huge, pukey oil slick.  Yeah.  But then it started kind of just...  Yeah, a little dissipating.  It was dissipating and getting, like, just kind of broken up and kind of going its own direction.  So I'm like, all right, I think we're good.  Oh, fuck! 
[01:30:30]  I think we're good.  Imagine you dove in the pool, and then you come up right into that.  Oh, just...  No, pools are an amazing thing, because within...  Because then I was, you know, kind of taking a look at it, and within a reasonable amount  of time, 10, 15 minutes, you didn't...  I had no clue that any kid puked in there.  But there's still, you know...  And then I just assumed the chlorine, you know, they over-chlorine stuff.  We should be good.  Wow.  We should be good.  At Disney, I saw something really fucking horrific by one of the pools. 
[01:31:00]  It was a girl with Down syndrome.  Right.  And she apparently got her period while she was in the pool.  And holy shit, did they come over there like fucking...  Like the bubonic plague was spreading.  Right.  Everyone out of the pool, they set up to get the fuck out of here tape around the pool.  And got people in there to sanitize.  But they're not.  They're making it look good, because they don't want to drain the pool.  So they pour little chemicals in, like, okay, we're good now. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, they shot the shit out of it.  The same shit happened...  We went down to Sesame Place in Philly.  And someone...  It's one of those, like, water parks that it's barely up to your knees, even.  And people just walk around, and there's big, huge water buckets dump on your...  Shitting and pissing.  Dump on your head and shit.  And someone did the same thing.  Either puked or had diarrhea.  And they set up to tape exactly what you're saying.  And I remember seeing the lifeguards, like, standing guard as a guy just sprinkling some shit.  Yeah.  Some chemicals around the problem area.  And they opened that thing within minutes. 
[01:32:00]  I think they have to just make it look good.  I think they shocked the shit out of the pool with chlorine.  Yeah.  But then you got to wait a little while for the...  No, they couldn't wait.  Time is money down there.  They opened this thing up.  I don't know.  Pronto.  I saw it at, uh...  There's a water park on Long Island.  Splish Splash.  Oh, yeah.  Splish Splash.  Girl had it coming down.  Everyone from Wine Dance and fucking Riverhead.  She started having her period as she was coming down the tube.  Cool.  So we were waiting on line to go in, and it's right near where the pool is where they come down.  Yeah.  And she got out and told her... 
[01:32:30]  Like, she's waving for a friend.  And a girl runs over there with a towel.  But she had her friend.  A different friend.  And got a towel, and then they were walking away.  And she was saying that, you know, she had her thing.  Oh, man.  But they did nothing.  Of course.  They just, like, kept moving the line.  Of course.  Right up the stairs.  Jeez.  The hell, ladies?  Keep it going.  You don't know when that shit's going to happen?  I know.  There's no fucking little...  Well, they get bitchy.  Right.  But you can't tell.  Like, you'll be on a water slide, and there's, you know, a bunch of blood coming out.  Let me say hi to John in Florida. 
[01:33:00]  John.  Hi, John.  Hello, boys.  Hey.  Hey, first off, I've got to say I'm Team Slabo.  So, go E-Rock.  Oh.  He's losing weight, man.  You ready to get weighed in tomorrow with Dr. Ian Smith?  I guess.  What does that mean?  He's being a tough guy.  No, I'm not being a tough guy.  Part of the book is it keeps stressing not to check your weight.  And that's what we've been doing.  Oh, so you know exactly what the number's going to be tomorrow?  Pretty much, yeah. 
[01:33:30]  John, go ahead.  Hey, I know what you mean there, Opie.  I used the, you know, hot tub jets there to clean out the old coolie hole.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus Christ, man.  Oh, yeah.  One big bidet.  I like to know what's going on in the jacuzzi now.  Now I've got to be paranoid.  Oh, you're crazy if you don't think people are peeing in that thing.  Well, you know, pee you've got to kind of accept.  You'll deal with the pee?  But, you know, just scrubbing out your bunghole in the pool. 
[01:34:00]  I'll do a karate chop position with my crack quickly when I'm in pool,  especially if it's a bit swampy from walking around on a hot beach.  With your hand?  Yeah, what else are you going to do?  You're in the pool.  You kind of go into the deep end, sort of, but you hold on to the side,  and you just get it done quick.  Holy shit!  If this happened, this would happen if we had that O&A cruise going. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, that would be great if she turns up with that fucking shit boat virus.  You've got to wash that shit out.  Oh, that would be great.  They've got showers everywhere.  Running to the bathroom.  Showers.  Just use a shower.  Are you a rookie?  That is true.  Fucking rookie.  Showers everywhere.  Nice washcloth.  Yeah.  Some soap.  That's, uh...  Oh, wow.  Here we go.  Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  How are you doing?  Um, this is all these fucking shit cruises and everything else. 
[01:35:00]  It all happens from the kitchen staff.  When you're on these cruises and you're in the dining room,  you see the pretty white people handing stuff out.  The chef comes out and jacks his hat.  Meanwhile, it's the cast of fucking Captain Phillips in the back.  Look at your food.  They're fucking chains of rail.  They're sitting there.  They don't give a shit.  They're sitting there going, like, ah, I didn't wash my hands or anything else.  They don't give a fuck.  They're like, the white people die.  Right.  Wow.  I would be a horrible restaurant worker. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Oh, that sign in the bathroom.  Washing your hands.  Oh, that's nonsense.  Like poppy.  That's nonsense for me.  Don't wash your hands.  I laugh at that shit.  Would you dip your finger in the sauce to taste it?  Oh, I would do all that.  I would be horrendous at that.  Um, let's say hi to Rod in Virginia.  Rod?  Yeah.  I'm Rod.  I've been on 22 cruises.  I've cruised basically since I was a little kid.  And I've gone on summer.  I've gone on winter.  And the winter cruises are the worst. 
[01:36:00]  That's where all this shit comes from.  You got fat, fucking, slobby people that are coming through that basically all they want  to do is get the deal and they just want to run around from place to place.  It was one story that I didn't see but my wife saw.  You had this big, fat guy that had this pizza and he sneezed it into his hand, looked at  it, and put it back into his fat, fucking mouth.  Oh, wait.  He sneezed.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  He sneezed on his own pizza?  No.  No. 
[01:36:30]  He had a mouthful.  Sneezed it into his hand and then shoved it back into his fucking face.  You know when you have something in your mouth and you got to sneeze, you're like, uh-oh,  I got it.  You're trying to chew and swallow before you sneeze.  And then the food came out in his hand and he just ate it again.  That's great.  Like a dog.  You ever have the food that comes out of your nose because you're trying to hold a sneeze  in?  Oh, I try to keep clear of that.  Oh, it's disgusting.  I did that once with a cup of noodles.  All right.  Yeah.  Because you're holding back a sneeze because you've got a mouth full of food and then it...  You ever try to pull a noodle out of your nose? 
[01:37:00]  Oh, my gosh.  And then eat it.  Yeah.  No.  But, yeah, you did.  It just, like, your eyes feel weird because it's moving behind it.  That's why you just got to let it go and fly out of your mouth.  Just open your mouth and bleh.  Fuck it.  Get that nose closed.  Let's say hi to Vinny in Florida.  Vinny.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  I got a story for you.  I was down in Key West with my wife.  We were at this bed and breakfast.  And we saw a couple of gay guys leave for the day.  Later on, I'm in the pool. 
[01:37:30]  I get back.  Well, I'm in the pool.  And these guys get back.  But they're walking funny.  And one of them's got a huge shit stain on his shorts.  So, he must have just blasted one out after the night.  Anyway, he goes into his room.  Must have.  It's five minutes.  Yeah, that's what it has to do.  My wife's like, get out of the pool.  Get out of the pool.  Get out of the pool.  I'm like, huh?  The guy comes out of the apartment in less than five minutes and gets in the pool. 
[01:38:00]  And you just see fucking shit dribbling from behind him.  Come on.  He's leaving awake like he's emptying a bilge.  It didn't happen.  This did not happen like this.  I swear to God.  The guy's not walking around with shit just dribbling off him.  He's pouring out of his ass.  And enough so where you could see him in the pool leaving a trail of shit.  You're a liar.  It's like that hot tub video.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just stew.  I am totally not lying. 
[01:38:30]  All right.  I love you guys.  All right.  We love you too, man.  Yeah, but I still think you're a lying sack of shit.  I think you're a lying, though.  That's crazy.  You're a liar.  That's crazy stuff right there.  Take care, guys.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's talk to a lifeguard.  Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Oh, what's up, boys?  Hey, boy.  What's up, man?  Hey, I worked at a county-run public pool in Jersey.  I'm not going to say where.  But at the end of the day, we would have to go and check the pool out. 
[01:39:00]  And we would find condoms, tampons, diapers, hair weaves.  And you know what I'm talking about.  But it was like an oil slick in the pool there at the end of the day.  It was horrendous.  Yeah.  Oh, I can only imagine what a public pool looks like after it goes home.  Public pool's got to be bad.  Oh, that's got to be disgusting.  And if somebody barfed or hit a number two in the pool, technically, you're supposed to  close the pool for 48 hours.  We would throw five gallons of chlorine in the pool, give it 15 minutes, blow the whistle,  and everybody jump back in. 
[01:39:30]  That's what I'm saying.  They're just making it look good.  They weren't scared at all.  They'd dive right through the oil slick.  It was fantastic.  Some greasy fucking weave floating like seaweed.  All right, man.  I believe that one.  Yeah.  I didn't believe the one before that.  No.  Drip, drip it.  Wait.  With the guy that got blasted.  His ass blasted.  It's shit.  He's shitting.  And that's dribbling out his ass as he's walking toward the pool.  And he's in the pool.  And then it's still shit dribbling out his ass. 
[01:40:00]  Get out of here.  And then the guy fell out of the closet because he was puking and he broke the camcorder.  Yeah.  Thanks, Tucker Max.  Biggest liar ever, in my opinion.  I hated that shit.  Please suck.  Dumb story.  Anything else on cruise ships?  Don't let it discourage you.  You should definitely still go and do it.  Yeah.  I've had great times on cruises.  They're fun.  And you've got kids the right age where you can do the Disney cruises.  Nice.  Those look great. 
[01:40:30]  No booze on the Disney cruises, huh?  What's going on?  I don't think that's true.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Oh, okay.  Well, yeah, they've got to have some booze for the parents.  There's no reason for me to go.  They would be out of their minds.  The Disney cruise has the water slides that go off the ship.  Oh, right.  And they're clear.  So you're at a certain point where you shoot off the ship and then you circle around and come  right back onto the ship.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a clear tube.  They've got some really cool shit on them.  That doesn't seem that scary.  I don't know if you're that high up in the middle of the ocean and you don't see anything  around.  You shoot out in the tube.  It's clear and then you just fly right back onto the ship. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, I think that would be cool.  Yeah.  Imagine that fucking, you're doing a conga line and she said it comes on really quick.  Right.  And the person that you're behind just starts shitting on your feet.  Oh, my God.  You're just doing that feeling hot, hot and then shit is just pouring on your feet.  You're like, what is going on?  Oh, the chocolate fucking, what is that?  The midnight chocolate buffet.  Oh, the midnight buffet.  It's just all fucking everybody, the back of everybody's legs.  The chocolate buffet.  Jesus.  Just leave it in the, every fucking state, the hallways must have just stunk. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  That one shit ship where they said the shit water was in the hallways.  What a nightmare.  Let's say hi to Johnny in Atlanta.  Yeah.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Did you see Jim Norton down there?  No, but I want to know if he ended up going to the Claremont Lounge.  There's a lot of trannies and freaks out there.  Then probably, yes.  We'll have to ask him.  I know maybe at home, but I really did.  Yeah, we didn't even tell people that Jimmy's not here today because he got a last minute  call to interview Ozzy today. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Where is that going to be?  I think he'll be back tomorrow.  I don't know.  And I don't even know why he's interviewing Ozzy.  He's done that a million times.  So why is it different this time?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's it for?  I don't know.  I'll make it quick, guys.  I was in Vegas one.  I thought you were dumb.  And this baseball player was looking around uncomfortably, and he ended up taking a shit,  and he had to call his manager, his best buddy, and come and get a change.  We know the story.  Yes.  I know you know the story.  Take it easy, man.  All right, buddy. 
[01:42:30]  All right.  There you have it.  Wow.  The shit ship.  The shit ship.  Those poor bastards.  And then there's people that didn't get sick, and they have to wind up cutting their trip  short because some people can't handle it.  What does the company do?  If you get sick, you're shit out of luck?  Or do they give you a voucher for another cruise?  They might.  I think if they can trace it back to something on the ship, then they're responsible for  it.  But if it's people just getting sick, they'll say, well...  It's part of the deal.  No, but my in-laws just got back, and like I said, two people they went with were quarantined 
[01:43:00]  for two days.  What happens to that?  Nothing.  That's the chance.  They lose their money?  That's the chance you take.  On it.  Just because you're sick on your vacation, they're paying you back for it.  I can still enjoy myself.  Why do I have to be forced to be in my fucking room?  Yeah.  If you have symptoms that seem like it could be, something that'll spread, they'll put  you in your room, and fucking that's it.  You're quarantined.  Wow.  That's going to suck. 
[01:43:30]  Yep.  They don't need that spreading.  Right.  If they trace it back to them, then they give you vouchers or a path off your next cruise  or something like that.  Did you see that fucking ship that's just adrift in the Atlantic, full of cannibal rats?  You read that story too?  Yeah.  Was it the Antarctic?  Well, it was.  It's in the North Atlantic.  How does the story go?  It was an old Russian?  It was an old ship.  It was built in like 1976.  Right.  Can you find that story?  It was under a couple of different flags during its history, but then they were up in Canada 
[01:44:00]  somewhere, and they got a bill to fucking, they had to pay a few hundred thousand dollars.  The guy couldn't pay it, so he just abandoned the ship.  Okay.  And then I guess it was bought by some Russian company, and they were trying to tow it down  to the Caribbean somewhere, and the tow line broke, so it was just adrift. 
[01:44:30]  Then they got another towing company that just towed it into international waters and let it go.  No kidding.  They said, well, it shouldn't be a danger to shipping, and it should sink after some time,  or I don't know.  Why don't they just sink it?  I think it takes a lot to sink a boat.  So then it starts drifting, and it's drifting toward, I guess, England, and they say that 
[01:45:00]  aboard this ship are just a shitload of cannibal rats, crazy rats that are all inbred and eating  each other, and just, you know, they keep going generation after generation of just eating  each other.  Oh, my God.  How many rats do you think are on there?  I don't know.  Well, it says it's infested.  So infested.  The story says it's infested, and it's heading toward England or something.  Someone's got to get on the ship and shoot some video.  That's the ship? 
[01:45:30]  No, the latest information is that they think it's sunk.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, really?  I mean, that's what England's saying.  Yeah, because I guess the lifeboats that they had on it have those things on there that  if the lifeboat goes in the water, a thing goes off a beacon.  Right.  And they started getting signals from the beacons.  So they were thinking that the ship sunk.  Oh, okay.  Because the only way those go off is if the boats get wet.  Right.  So it probably did sink.  Finally.  Yeah, with their cannibal rats on board.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What if the rats figured out how to do it?  Yeah, or the rats are just like... 
[01:46:00]  And they fucking launch...  They left the ship on their own?  Yeah, they launch the lifeboats and go in different directions to take over the world.  Oh, no.  Oh, cannibal rats.  I bet that's what they're doing.  What a sick story, though, huh?  That's crazy.  I didn't know you could just abandon a ship in the international waters and be like,  nah, it should be all right.  Yeah.  It should be cool.  I was watching some shit on Chernobyl last night.  A couple of documentaries.  Holy shit, those fucking crazy Russians.  Well, the urban explorers are having a field day checking all that shit out. 
[01:46:30]  It's still dangerous.  Like, the radiation is still crazy in those towns.  It's really high, right?  Yeah, so if you go to do a documentary on that, you can't just be in Chernobyl or the  neighboring town and stay there.  Like, you shoot your video, you do your shit, and you get the fuck out of there.  It's still nutty fucking radiation.  When does that radiation affect you?  Immediately?  I mean, the exposure?  There are certain parts inside the plant that, yeah.  Well, people aren't going inside the plant for the most part, are they?  No, there are still people doing work in there. 
[01:47:00]  Really?  Because they have the core, or what's left of it, encased in a sarcophagus of concrete.  Right.  But they're doing all kinds of work still.  They're drilling holes and trying to see things.  And I think there's also a problem with the upper portion of the plant is looking like  it's going to collapse.  So, and the heat is still crazy.  They said that the reactor core melted, and they pack sand around the core, and that 
[01:47:30]  sand leaked out on top of the core and melted also, and made this river of lava, molten radioactive  lava, go down the pipes and burn through concrete floors and just spread radiation everywhere.  And the Russians just didn't tell any of the people for a while.  The firemen that responded to the first sign of trouble, a few of them died that night  from radiation poisoning.  And then more died within a couple of weeks. 
[01:48:00]  Just some crazy shit.  And how many people were affected by this?  Just, probably millions at this point.  No, really?  In the surrounding areas?  There are children still being born with birth defects, and yeah, it went all the way  up to like, like, Greece, and I think Sweden or Switzerland got fucked up.  Jesus.  Look at this.  These old pictures inside.  Oh, they told the people, yeah, pack some light things.  We're leaving.  Right.  And they put them in buses and drove them off, and they never returned again. 
[01:48:30]  So all their shit is just kind of there.  Just sitting there rotting away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've checked out a lot of videos and pictures of people urban exploring over there.  It's really creepy.  It's really creepy, because everything is left.  Classrooms and stuff where people just left.  They just left.  Assuming they were going to be back.  Yeah, they thought they were coming back, so that made it even creepier, because there's  shit laying out that's like, you know, someone's cup.  Right.  Where they were drinking something.  Right.  In the exact same spot.  I love all that shit.  It is.  It's really just, uh...  That was a complete fucking, like, clusterfuck. 
[01:49:00]  That was so much worse than they led on to initially and in the years after.  I guess there was a good chance of a secondary explosion that would have just completely doused  Europe in radiation.  Wow.  But I guess they...  I don't know why we deal with that.  Why are we taking chances like that?  Well, the Russians aren't very good at safety as far as their nuke plants go.  I mean, we had our Three Mile Island thing, but really minor compared to this. 
[01:49:30]  There's no containment building.  The Russians just, well, it needs containment building.  We just...  They cut a few corners, did they?  They definitely cut a few corners in their nuclear power plant construction.  Really interesting documentaries, though, on there.  I think the battle, the Battle of Chernobyl is a good one.  We're shutting down a lot of our power plants, finally, right?  I don't know.  We're pretty...  They're pretty safe now.  Nuclear power plants, they seem pretty safe. 
[01:50:00]  How do you know?  Ah, because we don't really have that many accidents.  Fukushima.  I mean, here in the United States.  Fukushima.  Here in the United States.  You know, as long as you don't have them near earthquake zones or, like, where it could  flood, just things like that, I guess you're all right, but...  Keep them away from tsunamis.  Yeah.  Things like that.  When you're in Japan where there could be a tsunami and you're right on the beach with  your dumb fucking nuclear power plant, you're asking for trouble.  That was just crazy. 
[01:50:30]  Fukushima.  Yeah, pretty cool.  So the rat boat sank.  Yeah, I think rat boat sank.  Because a lot of people were getting paranoid where this fucking boat was heading.  Where it was headed, but they're not sure.  They assume it sank.  Well, why wouldn't they keep tabs on it?  Just as a goof on the internet.  Throw some shit on there so we can see where it's at.  I guess they were, but, you know, it's a big ocean.  I would imagine there's a lot of weird shit floating around in the ocean.  Probably.  What about that one thing they say, the garbage is as big as Texas in the middle of the ocean? 
[01:51:00]  Oh, that swirling thing of trash in the middle of the Pacific?  I don't believe that exists.  Why hasn't...  No one has really seen it.  No.  Or they'll show you a little bit, but the rumor is it's as big as Texas.  If there's something as big as Texas in the fucking ocean, I think that's all bullshit.  That's bullshit.  So who started that rumor?  I don't know.  Probably an environmentalist.  Really?  Yeah, trying to be like, oh, we got to do something about this. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, the garbage thing that's as big as Texas in the middle of the ocean.  Where is it?  The Great Pacific, what is it called?  Garbage Patch.  I don't believe it.  Garbage Patch is characterized by exceptionally high concentrations of plastics, chemical sludge,  and other debris that have been trapped by the currents of the North Pacific gyre.  Oh, well.  Why are we fucking with our water?  Jesus.  I don't know.  We're just so stupid. 
[01:52:00]  That's the salt water.  Yeah.  What are you going to do with that shit?  We've seen a lot of pollution, but what about the one that's as big as Texas?  I guess nobody's got a photo of it.  It's a lens.  They don't have a camera lens as big as Texas.  But can't they go high in the air and get, you know, a nice piece of it?  One would think.  One would think.  Do you know the Earth is only 0.06% water?  What?  With all the oceans and everything.  0.06%.  I thought it was mostly water. 
[01:52:30]  I thought it was like 90% water.  That's the surface area.  Surface area is more water.  It's 75% water.  But that's, if you look at the whole Earth as compared to water, there ain't much fucking water.  That's pretty shallow if you look at the whole globe.  Then we just throw shit in our water.  You don't care.  We're not going to be here.  People don't get thirsty.  I think it's pretty good that people are adaptable because then we fuck shit up.  And then the future generations figure out how to, you know, a good workaround.  They call us a bunch of assholes.  Isn't that right? 
[01:53:00]  They call us a bunch of assholes and then they figure it out.  It's been that way forever.  True.  True that.  You know, it's the ingenuity of the future generations that take care of the mistakes of the past.  So don't tell us to stop using fossil fuel and dumping our plastic in the ocean.  They could deal with it.  But eventually we're going to, like, you know, fuck it up for real.  I love that.  Do you want to leave that to our children?  It's like, yeah, they need to figure out shit themselves.  Make them smart.  They left us smokestacks.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck you. 
[01:53:30]  They left us all kinds of horse shit.  It's not just going to be our children that have to do that.  It's going to be one person of our children that figure it out.  Like, our children are just going to sit there and watch it happen.  It's not all of our children figured out, you know, how to cure polio.  We didn't do the iPhone, but we were there when it came out.  Jonas Salk, he did it.  Yeah.  And that's it.  You need one guy.  You're leaving this to our children.  You're right.  See, that's a good point, Sam.  One dude.  Let's go to Jay in Boston.  Jay.  Yeah, I'll be.  This is Jay from Boston. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  A minute ago, you were talking about your own polluting of water systems.  You want polluting of water?  Yeah.  And then I'm bitching that humans pollute the oceans.  Right.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  Thanks a lot.  We really appreciate it.  Yeah, good point, sir.  Good point.  Good point.  Good point.  Good point.  You can see the garbage pile on Google Earth, Sam Roberts.  I bet you can't.  And then this guy is more on the ghost ship.  That ghost ship story is cool.  Robin, Syracuse.  What's up?  Yeah, man. 
[01:54:30]  Like Ant said, I didn't realize you could just abandon a ship that big in the middle of the ocean.  The weirdest part of the article I read said, according to international law, in order to claim an abandoned ship even that size, all you have to do is attach a rope to it.  That's all yours.  And it's yours when it's been abandoned?  Just take it.  Yeah, they said there was like a million dollar salvage on it.  Like you could have salvaged it and maybe gotten a million bucks.  I was hoping someone would tow that fucker to England and just watch all those rats jump off when it got to port.  Oh, that would be great. 
[01:55:00]  Just a new fucking black plague in fucking England.  Cannibal.  Yeah, I thought that was the funniest part of that.  Maniac rats.  Right on, brother.  Yeah, that's pretty creepy.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  This guy sailed the...  The Seven Seas?  You sailed the Seven Seas?  Yeah, yeah.  And we lived a life of all in a yellow...  Someone was giving me some Beatles knowledge.  They said that Paul McCartney wrote one song per album for Ringo Starr. 
[01:55:30]  I wonder what he did.  He probably wrote that on the ball.  Right.  Just like, oh, one for Ringo.  There's your fucking stupid song.  Ringo, I've wrote another brilliant tune for you.  You fucking airhead.  Yeah.  Like Maxwell's Silver Hammer.  And we live!  Oh, yeah.  Was that another one of Ringo's songs?  Clang, clang, Maxwell's Silver Hammer came down.  Oh, that was a terrible one.  I wasn't a fan of the Ringo songs. 
[01:56:00]  No.  What do you got, Doug?  So, anyway, so I sailed with six guys.  We leave out of Boston and sailed down to Bermuda.  And as we come through the Gulf Stream, we see this huge...  Can't tell what it is.  It's, you know, whatever on the horizon.  Thought maybe it was a wreck.  And as we get closer, we can see it's just a huge collection of garbage,  probably the size of a football field.  And there was everything.  There was wood.  There were coolers.  There was, you know, plastic garbage bags. 
[01:56:30]  It was unbelievable.  I mean, I got pictures of it.  It just was, yeah, disgusting.  I can't imagine what something the size of Texas would look like, though.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Pretty creepy.  A lot of that stuff ends up breaking down, except for the plastics, obviously.  Yeah, like, you know.  But a lot of that shit...  It's gross.  Wood's gonna rot, I would assume.  It sounds gross.  All right, thanks, Doug.  That sounds cool, though, to fucking...  Yeah, everything else probably gets, like, picked at by fucking fish,  like, organic materials and stuff. 
[01:57:00]  But then the plastic, which lasts, probably just, you know, all hangs out together.  Those goddamn beer can rings and everything.  And a bunch of these dopey fish just assume it's some kind of coral reef.  Oh, a coral reef for us to live in.  I'm gonna swim my little skinny head up to my thick gills into this plastic ring  and see what happens.  Ow!  Ow!  I can't breathe!  And make the humans feel bad about themselves.  Yeah, exactly.  Dumb fish.  Oh, nothing worse than seeing that shit, though. 
[01:57:30]  Well, the big cause du jour is the dolphins in Japan.  Right.  I guess the cove thing with the dolphins being slaughtered,  that's like the new big celebrity cause that they're tweeting about.  That they'll forget about in a year.  Oh, of course.  Remember Coney?  God, let's list all of them.  Yeah, yeah.  They just move on to the next thing.  The Occupy shit.  And, yeah, they just move on to the next thing.  And the dolphins, that's the big thing right now.  No one likes the fact that dolphins are being hacked apart in Japan. 
[01:58:00]  And why are they being hacked apart?  I don't know.  What do they use?  Their fins for boner powders?  Oh, more boner.  Is that what they're doing?  Boner powder?  Fin boner powder?  Probably right.  You gotta kill their little...  What do they make fucking dildos out of their bottle noses?  For their perverse culture?  And then they have sex with their girls.  Yeah, yeah.  With the dolphin noses.  As they wear little fucking schoolgirl uniforms and go...  So he could have a three-headed glowing monster penis that he fucks her with? 
[01:58:30]  Crazy goddamn culture with that fucking anime porn shit.  So what's up with the dolphins?  Well, they herd him into that little cove and then they hack him up.  Hayden Panetari is big on that one.  I don't know how you could do that.  Let me see.  Hayden Panetari was there in Japan for the dolphin thing and was crying after they were 
[01:59:00]  told to fuck off by the Japs, as the guy writes.  Really?  Is there a video of that?  The Japs.  People still using World War II lingo.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, what about Hayden Panetari?  Don't they say, like, the dolphins are really smart?  That's what I hear.  So why wouldn't the dolphins get the word out that maybe avoid Japan?  Yeah, avoid Japan at all costs.  Or at least that cove.  Can't you just swim out and go, boy, I think there's some shit going on over there.  You might want to avoid that area. 
[01:59:30]  A few clicks, a few fucking whistles, and you're out of there.  Is that Hayden Panetari crying?  Come on, let me see.  That girl should have been born a midget, by the way.  She has the weirdest little body.  I think she just made it.  Yeah.  I think she just made it.  Just made it.  Huh?  It was painful.  It was something that you just looked at it and said, anyone who couldn't do that to an 
[02:00:00]  animal like that, there's got to be something wrong.  Oh, man.  Same with Japs.  Hero, an unbelievable journey.  18-year-old Hayden put her life at risk.  She joined a group of peaceful protesters at sea in an effort to save Pilot Whales, part  of the dolphin family, facing death by Japanese fishermen.  Pilot Whales, I've never seen that.  And she fought back the tears.  What's going through your mind when you're out there?  We knew that it was very possible for us to get hurt.  It was very possible for us to be detained by the police. 
[02:00:30]  No one's going to fuck with you.  You're Hayden Panetari.  Right.  The fear just completely went away.  Oh, yeah.  The group traveled on surfboards through water, bright red, from animals already slaughtered  for their meat.  The group's mission?  To form a memorial circle at Taiji Cove, where the whales were captured and trapped in nets.  They were so pretty, too.  Oh, my God.  They were like teddy bears in the water.  They just immediately kind of slowed down and started gathering towards the net. 
[02:01:00]  Maybe they shouldn't do that.  A little baby popped its head up at one point and just kind of looked at it.  And just the fact that all of us so wanted to go over there with the knives.  Could you imagine having to listen to this babble while you're just trying to get laid by this girl?  Seriously, set them free.  You're like, yeah.  You're sitting somewhere with us.  I'd always be in a jail in Japan right now.  Yeah.  Hayden.  That's so cool.  God, you're so fucking good and noble.  Tell me more about the dolphins.  And then your head, you're just like, how can I get in her vagina? 
[02:01:30]  Right.  How can I get my penis to go repeatedly in and out of her vagina?  Because that's all I want right now.  Like a dolphin trying to break through a net.  Right, right.  Over and over again.  That's it.  You know, much like the dolphin, my bottlenose cock would like to go into your cove.  Would like to break free.  Now, don't you want to free my bottlenose dick from these pants?  Are these the same assholes from the movie The Cove? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  It's just a different angle on the whole thing.  And why are they doing this?  What dumb reason are they giving that they do this?  Yeah, what are the Japanese doing?  Yeah, not hate and penetrating.  No one eats dolphin, right?  As much as we're goofing on her, I'm happy that she tried to do something.  There's plenty of other fucking food.  Why?  Oh, this guy might have an answer on the line.  I bet he doesn't.  I bet the next call will be how much of an asshole this guy is.  Dave in Cleveland.  Dave?  Hey, boys.  How are you?  I'm all right for a Monday.  You know how it is, brother. 
[02:02:30]  Right on.  Right on.  Right on.  Amen.  The Cove is actually a rite of passage for that section of Japan turning the boys into  men by whacking a bunch of dolphins.  That sounds good.  That's what they do to prove to people that they're big boys now.  Well, that doesn't make much sense.  To prove they're big boys, they go in and they kill a dolphin?  Yeah, it's shitty.  I know.  Humans just suck.  That's my new theme.  Humans just suck.  We do suck, man.  Hey, love you guys.  We just suck.  Of course you do.  Wow.  So Hayden Panetary goes over there. 
[02:03:00]  She was 18 then.  She's 24 now.  Oh, that's an old video.  Oh, okay.  She's still got to be way into it, though.  Is she still on her surfboard trying to save the dolphins?  Let me show you some video of us on surfboards trying to save the...  God, shut up.  I did the dolphin thing once on vacation in the Caribbean.  Oh, I did that, too.  You quote, swim with the dolphins.  Yeah.  And I realized what horse shit the whole thing was, and I'll never do it again. 
[02:03:30]  Really?  Yeah, they're not thinking of you or anything.  No, it's all food.  It's all about the food.  Yeah.  They're fucking miserable.  They're doing what the trainer says because they want the fucking fish.  But the trainer makes it like, look, see, looking right at you.  I did it.  He pushed me through the water very fast.  Look, he wants to shake your hand.  He doesn't want to shake my hand.  It was fun.  Look, he's going to roll over on his side and wave to everyone.  Oh, he's waving.  He's waving.  I'm guilty. 
[02:04:00]  I did once, and I'm just like, ugh.  I won't do that again.  Put your two hands, one on top of the other, out in front of your face, and he'll come up  and give you kisses.  Right.  He's not giving us kisses.  They don't even have mouths to kiss.  No.  They have like that weird fucking thing.  Right.  Nose teeth thing.  Yeah, they're just bumping into you.  No lips there.  They could get a fish.  They're fucking...  They're giving you kisses with that cut up fucking nose.  They're banging on the side of their pool.  Their noses are always all scarred up.  Yeah, we're supposed to make believe we don't see that. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  I'm seeing where he bangs into his fucking enclosure.  Where they forget for a second that they're not in the ocean, and they hit the bottom of  the pool like, oh, that's right.  I'm in captivity.  I forgot.  I forgot for a second.  There's no walls in the ocean for him to bang into.  It looks blurry over there.  Let me go as fast as I can.  It's over there.  Yeah.  I could swim pretty quick.  Watch me.  Ow!  Ow!  Oh, that's right.  We're in captivity.  I forgot.  I forgot again.  I forgot again.  I wish I was smart like people think I am.  Right.  I wouldn't keep swimming into this fucking wall. 
[02:05:00]  Over and over again.  Scraping up my nose.  And then we sit there and play our part.  Look how adorable they are.  Look.  He's nodding his head.  Yes.  He wants to eat.  Yeah, that is kind of, I don't know.  Did we get the answer to the dolphin things?  Donnie, do you want to add to this story?  Jay-Z and Beyonce kick off grimes together.  I did have a documentary a while back, and I don't know how true it is, but I think the 
[02:05:30]  reason that the Japanese killed the whales and the dolphins is they were actually in  charge of bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  I think they were actually the pilots.  I don't know if you guys seen that.  The pilot whale.  Oh, maybe that was it.  They got confused.  They hear pilot whale.  Fuck you, Norman.  They think he was flying the Enola Gay.  I got you.  All right.  Yeah.  I was watching, oh my God, I was watching the tail end of a Gilligan's Island yesterday,  and it was so racist. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, really?  Can we talk about it after the break?  Yeah, yeah.  So we all rush through it?  It fits into this.  Maybe we can find the clip, even?  Yeah, maybe we can find the clip.  All right.  Very cool.  Look at Madonna.  What is she doing?  She's a...  These idiots.  She's an idiot.  That way.  She's a cowboy, babe.  The drudge report, dubbing the Grammys, the Gameys.  Ha ha, the Gameys.  Get it?  The Kale Wood from the Los Angeles Times.  Good morning.  You gay.  Hi, how are you?  I'm good.  That's because you gay.  It's interesting that this mass marriage took place very late in the show.  Do you think the producers did that on purpose?  Yes.  Sure, I think, you know, if you've got a hot-button segment in your show, you might make sense to 
[02:06:30]  put it after, what, the kids are in bed, or, you know, put it after the 11 p.m. hour.  I think that was no coincidence, for sure.  Really?  No coincidence.  Well, I ask that because some conservatives object to Macklemore's songs because its lyrics  say, in part, well, they say it trashes right-wing conservatives, but I tend to think that's not  really the Grammys audience anyway.  Asshole.  Right.  I mean, I think the Grammys, they know their audience. 
[02:07:00]  This is, you know, a bit that was going to go over pretty well and was really pretty well  done.  I mean, whether or not you're a fan of Macklemore, I think it was a pretty sweeping segment to  have on the show last night, for sure.  What was she?  A lot of people were touching the audience as well.  That's famous for her.  She sings the hook on that song.  So, let's get back to the music because supposedly that's what really matters when you watch the Grammys.  Yes.  That was successful.  Supposedly.  The biggest moment of the night in your mind?  You know, I'm going to go with Lorde doing Royals. 
[02:07:30]  This is a 17-year-old performer.  Are you going to go with that one?  It's a 17-year-old woman that looks 35.  Right.  Looks like she has Parkinson's.  Now she's on one of the biggest stages that you could have as a musician and so totally poised,  so totally in the moment.  So totally uglier than her video.  Virtually silence.  Wow.  I think that you just saw such a confidence that was pretty amazing to see from someone  so young. 
[02:08:00]  Well, the other amazing thing about her, she actually had clothes on.  That was one thing.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  And you could see her singing because so many of the performances, they had that big fog machine  going, and you couldn't really tell whether the singers were singing or not.  And I kind of wanted to know.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Why would you want to know?  I mean, Ward is kind of giving you a little bit stripping away some of the artifice.  I mean, you know, look, it's an act, it's a persona, she's no less interested in show business 
[02:08:30]  than anyone else, but her version of it is a little bit more stripping away the artifice.  Well, you are just so perceptive.  Stripping away the spectacle, or at least the spectacle that we're used to.  Yeah, exactly.  And I think she's getting, you know, really kind of dangerously good at it, especially  in an awards show where I think she really stands out.  Yeah, she was amazing.  It was terrific.  Oh, absolutely.  Dangerously good at it in a good way.  Right, of course.  Unless of the musician in your mind who lost out.  I think I've probably got to go with Kendrick Lamar, the great-  Kendrick Lamar?  Young guy. 
[02:09:00]  Thanks.  He was up for a ton of awards and lost them all, including several to Macklemore and Ryan  Lewis, which, you know, even after the show, Macklemore-  Fuck Macklemore.  Yeah.  God.  Can't stand that guy.  All right, we're going to talk about Gilligan's Island next.  Oh, a little bit.  Great.  Nice topical break.  Well, we did an hour on the Grammys.  Yeah, but during that hour, you yelled at me for not liking Chicago.  Yeah, well.  I didn't yell at you.  You scolded me. 
[02:09:30]  You did scold me.  The guy knows how to sing.  And Robin Thicke doesn't know how to sing.  All right.  Alan Thicke does.  All right.  Maybe Alan Thicke in Chicago should be on stage.  Robin Thicke has genius producers all around him.  But when it comes to just singing, you know, it's not that great.  That's all I'm saying.  He came up with a goddamn catchy song.  But how much of that song was him?  I don't even know.  Did he write the song? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, he's a songwriter.  Okay, so he wrote the song.  And he sang it.  He sang it.  Did he produce it?  No.  Pharrell produced it.  That's the guy with the wacky hat?  The hat guy.  Mm-hmm.  Right.  Scott Pharrell.  Yeah.  Different Pharrell.  Scott Pharrell.  Pharrell Williams.  Great.  Yeah.  Okay.  Gilligan's Island next.  I would like to see her get mushroom stamped.  She did once, though.  Kanye mushroom stamped her.  Kanye definitely mushroom stamped her. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, that was a good mushroom stamping.  Yeah.  Who else?  Madonna.  Madonna.  Oh, she needs a mushroom stamping.  With a dumb fucking cowboy outfit.  I don't know.  What was that?  She looked like the KFC dude.  Yeah, it's like...  Colonel Sanders.  She looked like a plantation owner.  She looked like...  There was a few other ones there.  Oh, the Quaker...  The Quaker...  Quaker Oats guy?  The Quaker Oats guy.  And she showed up with her black son, so nobody could get mad at her hashtags.  That's true.  She did. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, she did that on purpose.  Nothing better than a lily white celebrity walking around with a little black child.  She threw the colored one in a bone.  Oh, jeez.  Really a more eloquent way to say that.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, she has a lot of kids.  Well, why wouldn't she bring a lord?  Because there was a lord there already, and she was very popular.  You know what I learned this weekend? 
[02:11:30]  The goofiest thing.  Did you know that Muhammad Ali has a brother?  That just blew my mind.  He does?  You didn't know that either, right?  No.  And they started boxing together in Lexington, Kentucky.  And his brother didn't do so well.  I guess not.  And that's why we don't know his brother whatsoever.  But look at this guy.  He looks just like him.  Wow.  Muhammad Ali.  He does.  Yeah.  Get him in the white hat. 
[02:12:00]  Because that really...  Oh, man.  And he's still alive.  Muhammad Ali has a brother out there that just fucking hangs out.  Do that one.  No, go down one more.  Go back.  Yeah, right there.  Right there.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Is that fucked up?  Is he just part of Muhammad's, like, posse?  No, not really.  He just got his own thing going on.  What's his own thing?  He was an amateur boxer.  He didn't do too well.  And then he moved on.  And then Muhammad Ali becomes the greatest of all time, some would say. 
[02:12:30]  The greatest?  Or right the fuck up there.  Yeah.  I had no idea he had a brother.  I didn't either.  Just walking around.  You would have thought you would have seen him around more.  Yeah.  An older or younger brother?  What is he?  I can't even tell.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And then Ali has a son he doesn't even fucking talk to, or hasn't really talked to, even  since, like, 1986.  That's how the article started, I guess.  It was in the paper about his brother.  I mean, his son.  His son, and then it goes on.  Who's living in squalor, basically, in Chicago. 
[02:13:00]  Jeez.  That seems like a scumbag move.  So then I'm like, and then I think it mentioned Muhammad Ali's brother or something.  I'm like, brother?  So I fucking Google imaged him.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Can you look up Muhammad Ali's son?  He's in Chicago.  He's living with his wife, and they have two kids.  They live in a horrendous section of Chicago.  Muhammad Ali's son.  He's got two sons.  Muhammad Ali Jr., which makes...  I read that article over the weekend.  You did, right, Travis? 
[02:13:30]  What else?  What am I...  Well, I thought it was really interesting when he said, like, how Muhammad Ali left him  when he went to go get something to eat.  And when he finally reconnected with him, like, later that day, he's like,  why'd you leave me?  He was, like, 14 years old.  And Ali goes, I forgot you were in the car.  Right.  That's the first time that he kind of figured out that Parkinson's was right around the corner.  Oh, boy.  That was 1986.  Yikes.  This kid was born in 72, so that's not him.  No, the Muhammad Ali kid looks like shit. 
[02:14:00]  That's him.  Wow.  He looks like shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He looks like Eddie Murphy doing a bit.  Isn't it amazing?  It's like Bowfinger.  Yeah, Bowfinger.  What do they got on him?  Look up the article, Sam.  It was in the paper on, like, yesterday or something.  Dying Ali, his fearsome fourth wife, and a savage family feud over his $30 million fortune.  Hmm.  Hmm.  So.  But he's got a son in Chicago living shitty. 
[02:14:30]  Who knew?  The secrets of Muhammad Ali.  Right.  Let's go to Gilligan's Island.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  If you find anything out about Muhammad Ali's son that's living shitty, let us know.  Anybody who wears their keys around their neck.  Is having a tough time.  Living shitty.  Living shitty.  So, Anthony was watching Gilligan's Island over the weekend.  Yeah.  This makes Sam laugh.  Yeah.  No, it doesn't make me laugh that Anthony was watching Gilligan's Island.  It makes me laugh that you were like, fuck Kendrick Lamar. 
[02:15:00]  Fuck this guy.  Fuck this guy.  I will be right back with Gilligan's Island.  Gilligan's Island.  That's right.  That makes me laugh.  Gilligan's Island is one of the worst shows on television, by the way.  Even as a guy that likes nostalgic television, as I do, I cannot find anything redeeming about  Gilligan's Island.  It doesn't hold up?  It's not funny.  What about Ginger's tits?  No, the girls aren't even, Ginger, Mary, and Ginger.  The girls aren't hot.  The fucking stories are so dumb and not even in a funny way. 
[02:15:30]  What, you never threw the ball around with the girls?  Never.  In the lunchroom going, all right, so which one would you pick?  Oh, so are you a Ginger or a Mary Ann?  Fuck, who cares?  And then someone would have to say Mrs. Howell just to get the left.  Oh, my God, you're crazy.  Come on.  That's crazy.  The funniest person on the show was Mr. Howell, I think, personally.  Backus.  Yeah, Jim Backus.  Jim Backus.  But everything was just so ridiculous and over-the-top stupid. 
[02:16:00]  But then, I tuned in yesterday, I was going around the channels, I see it, and I see it's  an episode where they have a Japanese guy, apparently, not sure the war was over, World  War II, that is, and he's on the island.  He got there by submarine.  Right.  And he captures all of the castaways.  Right.  It's not a Japanese guy, though.  It's some white actor, regular Caucasian actor, where they make up his eyes to make him slanty. 
[02:16:30]  Right.  And then they put these big, thick Coke bottle glasses on him.  Sure.  They shove some buck teeth in his mouth and make him talk like this.  And it's so over-the-top racist.  Can't tell the difference.  And Hollywood did that a lot.  A lot.  They just didn't believe that Japanese people could act for them?  I don't know.  Why wouldn't they just get some Japanese guy to do that?  Maybe there weren't many Japanese actors available at that time. 
[02:17:00]  I'm not sure.  They were too busy rubbing dolphin stuff.  Dolphin fucking hacking dolphins up.  Right.  To make their boners more.  Yeah, boner fucking powder.  More rigid.  They probably didn't think the Japanese actors looked Japanese.  Japanese enough.  Because everybody was so used to just their stereotypes.  Right.  They probably couldn't get a Japanese actor to go,  Why would I show you?  And don't talk like that.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  And I'm a big, huge fan of stereotypes.  Yeah, I love them.  You love them.  I think it's hilarious. 
[02:17:30]  Because we all do it, too.  That's the sad part.  Not even the sad part.  That's the truth.  But where did the buck teeth come from as far as Japanese people go?  I guess Japanese people back in the day were known for having, you know,  maybe teeth that weren't all that good.  England's known for having bad teeth.  But Japanese were known for having buck teeth as far as how they were portrayed in cartoons.  Yeah.  I wonder where that came from.  I don't know that one.  There must have been some, like, leader that had it.  Right.  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  If anyone knows, please call the show.  All right.  Here's a clip from that.  Yeah.  A little Japanese sailor.  He's confronting Ginger and Gilligan.  You think I'm just a movie star, don't you?  You mean behind that crease paint there's something we don't know about?  I'm secret agent 372536.  372536.  Oh, mama-san, that's no secret?  I am a...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Mama-san, that's no secret?  He's not Japanese.  He's not Japanese at all. 
[02:18:30]  No, no.  He's Italian.  Yeah, he's an Italian guy.  Just fucking...  Do we know who played this guy?  I can look it up after we get it.  Oh, yeah.  Keep going.  Yeah, we'll find a real picture of him.  Oh, mama-san, that's no secret?  I am a judo expert.  And I'm good-rooking.  I'm good-rooking.  All right.  Rats-a-rock.  Hold her of the black belt.  Hooray.  Rats-a-rock.  What the...  Thank you.  She's leaving?  She's putting on her judo... 
[02:19:00]  I'm God.  ...fighting outfit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's chasing her, going to judo.  Now it's fast motion, bad...  judo fighting.  And then...  Who's the guy?  Yeah, that's not even the guy anymore.  And that's not even Ginger.  No.  That's horrible.  So much for him.  Oh, Christ.  Ginger?  I mean, 37, 25, 36...  That was horrible.  They were among the worst stunt actors ever. 
[02:19:30]  It was really bad.  They didn't even look like them.  Not at all.  Back then, they used to do that all the time.  Star Trek was really good when, you know, they'd be in the engineering or something, and Kirk's  getting into a big fight.  And all of a sudden, the shot would pull back to a very wide shot.  Right.  And you'd see a guy that looked nothing like Captain Kirk anymore.  And he's fighting.  His hair, his body, everything's different.  That's the guy?  Vito Scotti.  We know that.  Vito Scotti.  Hold on.  I know that actor.  He's been in a lot of other things. 
[02:20:00]  You know Vito Scotti?  Well, let me see.  Let me see more of his pictures.  Keep going.  All right.  Keep going.  Yeah.  Oh, I know that guy.  He was.  He was a big character actor.  Oh, I'm.  He would always play like an Italian guy.  Right.  Or Asian.  Or Asian, apparently.  Or Mexican.  Mexican with the vending machine teeth.  He's like the racist dude.  What was he in in his later years? 
[02:20:30]  I think he was in.  Let's see.  Is he still alive?  Probably not.  He was in The Godfather.  Yes, he was in The Godfather.  What did he play in The Godfather?  Unfortunately, Vito passed away in 1996.  Wasn't he Enzo?  No.  Was he the baker?  I have no idea on this one.  He was Nazarene?  I think it was the baker or something. 
[02:21:00]  All I got is Nazarene.  Yeah.  There's more clips of him on Gilligan's Island.  Oh, that's funny that that's him doing the fucking.  Right.  There's more clips, though.  There he is.  That's him.  All right.  Okay.  All right, then.  Let's say hi to Brian in DC.  Brian.  What's up?  Hey, buddy.  The buck teeth and coke bottle glasses is from propaganda during the war. 
[02:21:30]  They always portrayed Tojo that way.  And if you look at all the old propaganda stuff, Tojo always had buck teeth and the coke bottle  glasses.  Hitler always looked like a monkey.  Well, we know what Hitler looked like.  And Mussolini always looked like a midget.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's see some more video of him as the Japanese guy.  On Gilligan's Island.  It's great.  He's so over the top.  Good.  Good. 
[02:22:00]  What's so better with you?  You think I'm dumbass?  Huh?  I'm more American.  I went to American college.  I graduated.  I was going to touch on your husband, but now I'll leave that to you. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, my God.  It's so bad.  Oh, my God.  And that was just on TV yesterday.  So it's like...  On a well-accepted sitcom.  Yeah.  And now, once again, radio guys do this.  Fired.  You're fired.  Immediately.  So how could they play that now in this PC world we live in where just because it's  old, it's okay?  I guess.  Is that what it is?  That made me uncomfortable.  Oh, that's so like...  I don't get uncomfortable by that shit.  Whoa. 
[02:23:00]  It looks like you in trouble.  Trouble.  It's very demeaning.  Yeah, I would think it definitely dehumanizes.  You think?  Yeah.  But you know what?  We didn't really like Japanese people right up until, like, the 70s.  Right up until you figured out sushi is very tasty, man.  Yes, yes.  And you're like, okay, all is forgiven.  But Japan was like, as a kid, remember saying Japanese junk?  Oh, that's Japanese junk.  Like, if something was made in Japan, it meant it was terrible stuff. 
[02:23:30]  Right.  We were all brainwashed by our elders.  And the Japanese, the whole thing, we were still very angry at them for World War II, I  think, all the way up to the, like, 70s.  Right.  Yeah.  And they started, you know, catching on.  Hey, who's Elizabeth Vargas again?  She just admitted she's an alcoholic.  Why?  Who is she?  She's on ABC News.  You know her if you saw her.  Oh, right.  Oh, yeah.  She's on, like, 2020 and shows like that. 
[02:24:00]  She's a lush?  She likes to tip it back.  Why would she admit she's an alcoholic?  Anxiety-fueled boozing?  Maybe she wants to help.  Is there an anxiety-fueled drinking addiction?  Most people know her.  Medicating.  Ooh, the Holly Scoop.  Watch out for Holly Scoop.  Welcome to Holly Scoop.  I'm Stephanie Bauer.  Well, why aren't you Holly?  Right.  Vargas breaks her silence after exiting rehab.  The rehab news was shocking enough, and now she gives surprising details about her addiction  to alcohol, something no one expected. 
[02:24:30]  Oh.  The put-together host and journalist tells Good Morning America that she realized she needed  professional help when she showed up to do an interview for work on a Saturday and was  drunk.  Oh, cool.  Quote, I was in no shape to do that interview.  Can we see that interview?  So, in November of 2013, with support from her ABC family, the 51-year-old headed to a  treatment facility.  It's no ABC family.  Quote, we stayed for 28 days and left against their advice and came home because I really  wanted to come home.  Uh-oh.  They said, we think you need to do more work. 
[02:25:00]  I came home for five days and realized they were right and came back and finished.  She explained, I am an alcoholic.  It took a long time to admit it to myself.  She says the amount of energy it took to keep the secret from her colleagues was exhausting.  She revealed she also suffered from panic attacks while on the air.

You'll be fine.  Exactly.  Don't sweat it. 
[02:25:30]  So, she's an alcoholic.  There's no ABC family.  The family.  No, they're obligated to do something and they can't fire you for it.  By the law, they have to deal with your shit.  Right?  Your horse shit.  Your horse shit.  Exactly.  Why do we sugarcoat everything?  Yeah.  ABC doesn't have a family.  The family.  It's a shitty company like any other shitty company.  Like they care.  As soon as you're out of line, they get ready.  Yeah.  You think the CEO cares?  No!  Oh boy, does he not care? 
[02:26:00]  It's too busy crunching numbers.  Right.  If your alcoholism is affecting the bottom line...  Get the fuck out.  ...you're going to realize there's no family.  I need help.  Yeah.  For the rest of her life, people are going to be like, you think she's drunk right now?  When they're watching her on TV?  I could probably do that.  I could probably like say, look, I realize I need help.  I need to go to 28 days of rehab.  And I would get 28 days off.  That would rule.  And they can't fire me or anything, right?  Yeah, no, they can't.  Fuck.  I should do that.  Do I have to go to rehab? 
[02:26:30]  Or can I say I'm going to the special rehab in like St. Thomas?  Bieber's in Panama.  See?  That would be cool.  He's not in rehab.  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.  He just goes to Panama for help.  But Usher is giving him an intervention down there, I hear.  In Panama.  That's what I hear.  Well, that's the perfect place to have an intervention.  Panama?  Panama.  Panama.  He says Panama.  He does say Panama.  But it's like Panama.  You don't say Panama.  You don't say Panama.  Panama.  Panama.  Panama. 
[02:27:00]  Panama.  I'm going to Panama.  Screw you guys.  I'm going to Panama.  I'm going to Panama.  Panama.  Panama.  Pan.  Panama.  Panama.  You don't have to sing the song every time you say the word.  Well, that's how you figure out how the word goes, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone knows that.  They're singing the song.  It's like Panama.  Oh, yeah.  Panama.  Not Panama.  You ever see the Panama Canal?  No, it's Panama Canal. 
[02:27:30]  They got the Panama Canal?  Why is Don Wicklund walking around shaking his head all pissed off?  Look at him.  What's the issue behind the scenes today?  You want me to go find out?  Yeah, yeah.  Please do.  Okay.  What's around here like a gang member?  The pre-show was a technological shit show, so that might have something to do with it.  Whoa.  When is Mars coming back from his vagina surgery?  Oh, shit.  I don't know.  I think he might actually be getting the genital replacement.  Wow.  Why does he get to be out for so long?  Yeah, really?  What the fuck?  I have to go to rehab if I want to fucking get 28 days off. 
[02:28:00]  Let's do rehab, man.  That would be good.  All of a sudden, we both say, you know, we both have an addiction.  I got an addiction to Candy Crush.  Yeah.  People still playing that?  Yeah.  Dude, because they keep adding levels.  I'm up to 478.  It goes up to 485.  And then they add more?  Yeah, but they just added this one, so I'm hoping there's a lot of downtime.  No, I don't want to play anymore.  It's my OCD mind.  I got to get to the end.  You think I want to still play Candy Crush?  Are you kidding me? 
[02:28:30]  I wouldn't.  I wouldn't want to play that.  I'm stuck.  So I can't wait to get to 485, and then when's the next update?  They're just going to keep updating it.  I know, but I'm hoping there's going to be some downtime.  They're not going to let that monster go.  They only have a couple updates a year, right?  Hopefully.  No, they got more than that.  Because they just squeezed this update recently, and I'm almost done with it already.  Yeah, they got more than a couple a year.  Oh, I'm so fucked.  And then the asshole he grabs Candy as a copyright. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  What happened?  He owns the word Candy as far as online gaming goes.  How could you have Candy?  It's not just about the copyright anymore.  Now you could specifically have it.  But who didn't have Candy before?  For online games?  I don't know.  But they can't do Candyland online.  Well, you can't have an online Candyland?  No way.  But Candyland's been around forever.  Not online.  Fuck.  Candyland.  Gotcha.  It's amazing.  Can I tell you something?  The one thing about having a kid, you start reliving your own life. 
[02:29:30]  Word.  Do you remember playing Candyland?  Yeah.  It's the worst fucking game ever.  It's terrible.  Candyland and Chutes and Ladders stunk.  Like, Chutes and Ladders is even worse.  Terrible.  My son is three and a half and he's bored with it.  Like, who was this game made for?  Yeah.  And I feel like I was like seven or eight playing Candyland.  I know, right?  Yeah, I kind of remember playing it.  We must have been so fucking starved for entertainment growing up.  Because I really believe I was a lot older playing Candyland.  Yeah.  Like, I'm playing this and my son at three and a half is like, this is bullshit. 
[02:30:00]  Until you could finally figure out, like, how to play Life.  Right.  Life was a fun game to play.  Monopoly was a biggie.  That was a big step up.  Get sent to the poor house.  Right.  Or you win and retire in the big mansion.  Right.  That didn't send a very good message.  I bet there was controversy about that game.  It's like, it just shows, like, that you need money for happiness in your life.  Well, let's have Macklemore sing a song about it.  Yeah, Macklemore.  And then it'll be okay.  About how when he was three, he realized the game of life was racist and fucking... 
[02:30:30]  He's a liar.  Divisive.  He didn't think he was gay in third grade.  He didn't.  A fucking liar.  No.  The only time you think you're gay in third grade is if you're gay.  And if you're really gay.  I mean, that type of gay that...  Because the rest of people don't even know what that is.  Like a fucking...  Like a kid that's, like, less than a year old.  He's putting his mom's fucking high heels on.  Right.  And walking around like that, crawling around in a dress.  You mean that one boy that kisses all the other boys in class?  Yes.  Like, then you know, oh, I knew who you were. 
[02:31:00]  It's bullshit, because then the gays would say that that's not gay, necessarily.  Putting the high heels on.  No, it is.  Not necessarily.  Some would say that's not.  Some would say it's gay.  I would tend to think you might be right.  It may be quay, but it doesn't mean it's gay.  There are certain people that you can just kind of tell that they're gay at a very young age.  It's just, you know.  I was brought up close-minded.  There was a kid all the way through high school.  Yeah.  I don't even want to mention his name, but it's so obvious now. 
[02:31:30]  Sam Roberts.  It's so obvious now.  Just throw it out there.  Looking back, the kid was gay.  Yeah.  And we were on track and field and stuff, and he was an amazing power walker guy.  Oh, boy.  Whatever that sport's called.  They do that funny walk.  Well.  With the hips and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know why that's...  I thought you were going to say he really could run the baton rally.  But why is that an event?  Where'd the baton go?  Where are you just using both hands to run with? 
[02:32:00]  You don't have to...  I got it.  I got it.  I ain't going to drop it either.  What is it called?  Speedwalking or something?  Speedwalking.  It looks silly.  He was like one of the best in the county.  How are you the best at that?  That's just a silly walk thing.  But now looking back, it's like, oh, of course he was.  Was he gay?  But I was just stupid and naive, I guess.  I couldn't tell Richard was gay until he asked to suck my dick.  See?  So maybe I was close-minded.  I would tend to give it away.  Because he was my...  Yeah, yeah.  That kind of was a hint.  That was a hint.  I had to really put two and two together after that one. 
[02:32:30]  That was a bit of a red flag.  I had to connect the dots after that.  That was a bit of an eye-opener.  Got me a bit suspicious.  Yeah, yeah.  That's when my suspicions were aroused.  Along with my dick.  I call it Gregory when you can tell that early.  Because there was a kid when I was growing up named Gregory.  Oh, boy.  I'm not Gregory.  Cues?  I'm not Gregory.  Oh, that's true.  No, I'm out of this.  All right.  But he wore sweaters every day.  Always wore a sweater.  That's gay.  And he ran around trying to kiss every boy on the lips. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that was like his fun game.  I'm going to kiss you on the lips.  And all the boys were like, I don't want you to kiss me on the lips.  Yeah.  And that was the fun game.  And what?  And he was a bit swishy, too.  Yeah, a little swishy.  And then Macklemore popped up and sang a song about it.  Said it's okay and you're fine.  It's okay.  It's all right to take kisses from another guy when you're growing up.  Yeah.  Because we're all supposed to be accepting.  Yeah, let Gregory kiss you on the lips.  Right.  And you know, let Gregory. 
[02:33:30]  I wish I could do Macklemore.  Macklemore.  There was a kid in East Islip, too, when I was living there.  A little redhead kid.  And he was so gay.  Right.  At like, you know, very young age.  But everyone knew he was gay.  Also, Gregory always referred to himself and had people refer to him as Gregory.  Oh.  Never Greg.  Gregory.  Gregory.  Which is like, if you're wearing a sweater and your name's Gregory and you kiss boys.  You really want to be called Gregory.  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  Because I'm Greg.  And I swear it's not Gregory on my birth certificate because my mom hated the name.  Double G's.  Well, double G's on the end.  Did he kiss you?  Just like Greg Allman.  Did he kiss you, too?  No, but he tried.  He did.  I wasn't having it, though.  Why?  How would he try?  Like, he'd chase you around.  I'm going to kiss you.  And you'd run.  Yeah.  It was all just playful.  But then he tried to grab you and wrestle you to the ground.  Of course.  Was he a big guy?  No.  Did he get bullied?  It was when I was living in England, so it wasn't that bad. 
[02:34:30]  As Archie Bunker said, that's your fair country anyway.  He wanted to wrestle you to the ground so he could press his heart.  Oh, his little budding boner on you.  On you.  He had desires in his body that he couldn't explain.  His old mushroom stamp.  Right.  I never got mushroom stamped, though.  Oh, good.  Didn't Malcolm Moore do a liner for our show?  Can I hear that now?  Yes, he did.  Why?  Where was he?  I don't know.  We never talked to him.  Never.  Why the fuck is he doing a liner for our show?  Because this isn't the first time you guys have... 
[02:35:00]  See how needy he is?  Needy.  I didn't ask him to do a liner.  No.  We asked him.  Yeah, exactly.  And he went, oh, yeah, okay, okay, okay.  Can I write a song about it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I bet it's all sincere, not an ounce of comedy or irony in the fucking thing, right?  Right?  He has a sense of humor.  I don't think he does.  It was after I was trashing his Ceiling's Hands song.  The Ceiling Can't Hold Us.  Hold us.  You're trashing him for some reason.  Does he sing that part?  No. 
[02:35:30]  He's the rapper.  Yeah.  He doesn't sing the R&B hook on any of his songs.  Well, that's too bad, because that's the catchy part of the songs.  Yeah, there's different people doing that.  We don't have the liner.  We don't know where Eric put it.  Oh, E-Rock.  Let's say hi to Sean in Pittsburgh.  Sean.  Hey, Sean.  Hey, have you seen this show on E called Rich Kids of L.A. or something like that?  Magic Johnson.  Beverly Hills.  Oh, yeah.  Magic Johnson's son.  Wait, Rich Kids of Beverly Hills?  Yeah, it's basically...  He's about 400 pounds. 
[02:36:00]  He carries a purse.  He wears a dress.  Magic Johnson's son has gone full gay.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Full, crazy full gay.  No kidding.  Yeah.  The show is the TV version.  Like, you know Rich Kids of Instagram?  That was a thing.  They turned that hashtag.  They developed it into a TV show.  Why wouldn't they?  Is it good?  I haven't seen this yet.  No, it's not good.  Okay.  Before we do this real quick, you want to hear our liner?  Yeah.  Oh, we got the liner.  Yo, what up? 
[02:36:30]  This is Macklemore, and I want to give a special shout out to Opie, who just discovered our music  even though it's been out for a year.  You'll be on top of things, bro.  Oh, man.  Whoa.  In your face.  Wow.  He got you.  He dissed you pretty good.  Did I get mushroom stamped?  Yeah.  Macklemore just mushroom stamped you right there.  I got mushroom stamped?  Macklemore just mushroom stamped you.  Sorry, bro.  Have we ever played that?  Yeah.  I've never heard it before.  Oh, in show?  No. 
[02:37:00]  I think we did it once as a goof.  Yeah, because we were talking about him.  Like, look at what we got.  Hey, he seems like a nice guy.  Yo.  You got mushroom stamped.  I got mushroom stamped.  Damn it.  Look at Don.  Why is he so mad?  I don't know.  Don looks like the leader of the T-Birds.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Russian mob.  Like a low-level guy.  Yeah.  He said he doesn't want to talk about it.  What?  What is it, though?  That bad?  He said he hates stupid.  That's all.  Oh, boy.  That could be a lot of people. 
[02:37:30]  I don't know.  What's he doing working here, then?  Oh, boy.  Surrounded by it.  All right.  What do we got?  I want to see Magic Johnson's kid.  Let me try to see if I can look up just him, then.  Everyone knows it's Magic Johnson's son and that he's all in.  That's him?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  This is when he came out.  He is so gay.  Why is he a fat fuck?  What's good, brother?  What up?  What up?  What up?  Hey!  Hey!  That is horrible.  All right. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, yeah.  What up?  He came fucking...  He came out of the closet in a fucking supersonic transport.  My heart just stopped.  What happened?  Why?  Because I don't want that for my kids.  That's okay.  Oh, it's okay, though.  It's 2014.  It's okay.  Magic loves it and he accepts it.  You'd accept it.  I would absolutely accept the gay, but this is...  Everyone has their line.  He's fucking walking around in a purse with a purse and a...  And a mink.  And a mink coat.  Did you have your fingers in your ears with Macklemore last night? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, that's true.  I just...  Dude, that's where I still need some acceptance.  Some tolerance?  Some tolerance.  Because that is, like, so out there and over the top.  That's your problem, not his.  What up?  What up?  I'm tolerance intolerant.  I really am.  It gives me diarrhea.  Does he understand who his father is?  Magic.  Does he understand the one-on-ones he had with Larry Bird?  He could be one-on-one all he wants.  Never as fabulous as that.  Never.  Never.  All right, how do I prevent that? 
[02:39:00]  You could do my dad's tactic.  All right.  Kind of worked.  No, I don't...  I like girls.  No, I mean, whatever he is...  Quote, quote.  Son of a bitch.  Whatever he is is fine, but that would be...  Wow.  That'll give you something to cry about.  Oh, my God.  Can we see more of that clip?  Next time I hear you cry like that, you better have an arrow in your chest.  That was a good one.  That kept you from the gay?  Pissy eyes.  Call him pissy eyes if he ever cries.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.  And then hook him up with some fucking whore when he's 13 so he can get laid. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, I think that does it.  Let's do the what up, what up clip.  What up, what up, what up?  I had no idea.  This is Magic Johnson's son.  Wow.  Oh, good for him, right?  Fabulous.  Good for him.  Good for him.  He is fabulous.  Say tolerance.  There it is.  Say tolerance.  There it is.  Let's marry some people.  Let's marry a bunch of people.  Let's have a bunch of dudes.  Just like, go at it.  Let's bring back the gay off, huh?  I'm never doing that again.  Is this a regular TMZ piece or is it one where the guy is like, 
[02:40:00]  And Magic Johnson's son is gonna be...  You don't like that voice?  Anytime I hear it, I'm like, oh, that clip looks interesting.  I click on it.  Here we are.  Oh.  No, I just want a straight fucking news clip.  Well, don't worry.  It is a straight...  It's one of those.  It's one of the TV ones with your voice on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This has the voice?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Let's hear it.  Hey, brother.  What up, what up, what up?  Hey, you know who that is?  Irving Johnson III. 
[02:40:30]  That's right.  Lakers legends, Magic Johnson's son.  I always remember my Lakers.  He is out.  Out?  Out as in gay?  You're kidding.  Turns out the guy with a purse in one hand and another dude's hand in his other hand is gay.  Yay, gay!  You know how hard it is to be out publicly, out publicly as Magic Johnson's kid?  Yeah.  We spoke to Magic to see what his thoughts were on this.  And he says on behalf of himself and his wife,  Cookie and I love EJ and support him in every way. 
[02:41:00]  We're very proud of him.  My son is a gay man and I embrace his lifestyle.  It's true.  Dad loves the gays.  It's really great.  I think that's fantastic.  Yeah, but it ain't all rainbows and unicorns.  I looked on the website, there's some haters out there.  It actually really made me sad, some of the comments.  You go to the black blogs, in particular, they're tearing them apart.  For being gay.  Then you go to the gay blogs and they're also going after him because they think his fashion sucks. 
[02:41:30]  I hate these pieces.  They turn three seconds of footage into a whole piece.  Into this thing.  Because I just wanted to see, I didn't want to hear this shit.  I want to hear the son and see him walking around and talking and shit.  All he's saying is, what up, what up, what up?  Let's get some fucking video of him.  And he's on this new show.  Yeah, Rich Kids of Beverly Hills.  Rich Kids of Beverly Hills.  Yeah.  Rich Kids of Beverly Hills. 
[02:42:00]  I'm fabulous.  All right.  He's talking about Justin Bieber.  What the fuck?  Commercials.  It's a little commercial.  I want to say hi to the Nutribullet people.  Why would you do that?  What happened?  What about Dr. Ian Smith?  Well, he's cool, I guess.  And his blender that's under construction.  He'll be in tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  All the questions will be answered.  Have a good night. 
[02:42:30]  Comment, comment, comment.  Give us one comment on Justin Bieber.  He just needs to get it together.  I think that he just needs some time.  He's going through a lot.  All right.  He's going through a lot.  I'm in.  Good night, EJ.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  You're back.  Good night, EJ.  Oh, that's he loved dick.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  Let's go.  Listen, Johnson.  What do you think about Justin Bieber's DUI wrestling? 
[02:43:00]  My ass.  I'm not in.  Holy Jesus.  He is so flamboyantly gay.  Wow.  Does Larry Bird have a son?  He's the old man.  How did Magic get the, uh, how did he, uh, mysterious circumstances?  How did that happen? 
[02:43:30]  You think maybe, uh, something about an apple in a tree?  Something like that?  Uh, not falling very, uh, something.  Huh.  There have been suspicions over the years.  That's for sure.  It's like a lot of those apples just fell directly into his son's mouth, actually.  Uh-oh, boy.  Oof.  He's a bigger, bigger fella.  He is giant.  Ah, good for him.  Right, guys?  There you go.  That's what Macklemore taught me last night.  What would Macklemore say? 
[02:44:00]  Let's all swap spit.  Yeah.  I don't know if that was the whole...  Boy, that's what Macklemore was saying.  We gotta accept everything.  Yeah, but that doesn't mean we all have to kiss each other.  Mm-hmm.  And Justin Bieber, turns out, was doing nothing wrong, basically.  He wasn't drunk, and he was only going 30 miles an hour, and they pulled him over in the rented Lamborghini?  So why'd they pull him over?  Did his dad shut the road down or something?  His dad did shut the road down.  Fuck him.  I wish I had a cool dad like that.  He's a terrible dad.  That's a great dad.  Shut the road down for me so I could do some drag racing. 
[02:44:30]  Fucking drive up and down the road.  Why are people fucking, you know, dissing the Biebs' father, man?  It was all about safety.  He cares so much about his son.  Especially when your son's a public figure, right?  That's right.  Yeah.  He goes to the clubs with him, makes sure he doesn't get into any trouble.  Oh, good.  Has a few shooters with his son.  Where those whores don't take advantage of him.  Right.  A lot of money.  Guy's got a lot of cash.  You know what show you gotta watch?  What?  90 Day Fiance.  What is that?  What bit of drivel is this that you're talking about? 
[02:45:00]  Why?  What happens?  It's basically a show where guys, they insist they're not mail-order brides, but there's  like four guys, and they all have these women that they've met online and are now flying  in on a 90-day visa.  Are they all Russian?  One of them?  No.  One of them's Russian.  One of them's from Colombia.  Oh, boy.  And they're like mail-order brides.  Pretty much, yeah.  So what's the show about?  Just them getting their brides accustomed to living here, and it's just, I mean, you could 
[02:45:30]  tell completely.  I like the, I'm starting to like the Shah show.  Oh.  The Shah's of Sunset?  That one?  Come on.  I don't fucking know.  I don't even.  I used to say, oh, I don't watch that.  I've never seen that.  Now it's like, I've never heard of this.  There's a flamboyant Iranian gay guy on the Shah's of Sunset.  Can you imagine what he had to deal with growing up?  Keep it on the old DL.  I don't think they appreciate the gay and I am. 
[02:46:00]  Hell no.  Those Arabs, not very fond of the gay.  No.  Okay.  This is the one.  Like this is the little.  Mike and Aziza.  Aziza's the little Russian girl.  She's hot.  She's all right, but you can completely tell.  Bad shit.  She's nuts, and she's there like on a mission.  Like there is no sort of.  She just wants to live in America.  Those Russian chicks are fucking like determined.  Yeah.  And crazy, and they will fuck you up to get what they want.  I'll say it again. 
[02:46:30]  Russians scare me way more than.  Russians.  Well, let me go on.  Than you.  Than the you knows.  Gotcha.  Well, if you're talking about maybe tax value in your area.  Russians scare me.  I have some Russians around.  They scare me for real.  Yeah.  She showed it.  Like he brought her to his mom's house.  Uh-huh.  She didn't.  I guess she didn't trust the food.  Right.  She didn't eat one bite.  I will not eat this.  What did she think it was going to be poisoned?  It's okay.  It's okay.  I know how this is.  You poison people. 
[02:47:00]  Don't worry about me.  Let's see the clip.  My relationship with Aziza has mostly been just video chatting.  So it's crazy that we're finally together.  We have waited.  She's going to own all that shit.  And I want everything to be right.  Oh, this poor sap.  And this guy, I think one of them.  He lives in Cleveland, Ohio.  He's floating her in from Russia to Cleveland.  To Cleveland, Ohio?  Yeah.  This marriage isn't going to last.  Another one.  She's going to be packing her bags for New York in no time.  With his shit.  No offense to Cleveland, Ohio, by the way. 
[02:47:30]  But really.  There's another one.  The chick looks like a sex doll.  Right.  She's big tits, but she's from Columbia.  She loves to party.  And he flew her into Oklahoma or something.  Oh, boy.  And all she wants to do is drink and fuck.  And he's moved her into his parents' house.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Really?  I might be in on this show.  All right.  I might have to catch an episode or two.  Yeah, I might have to catch this shit.  We ever get clips from the fat show?  I'm working on it now.  All right.  For tomorrow?  Because I'll have that specific episode tomorrow. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Good.  Good.  You have to take your shoes off now.  It's his house.  Take your shoes off.  And the little Russian chick says, you have to take your shoes off now.  Oh, my God.  He just flew her in two days ago.  Oh, my God.  She's already in his shit.  And look at this little.  She's like 20-something.  He's 31.  You can tell this guy really probably had a lot of issues getting a girl.  Oh, yeah.  He's fucked.  And now he's probably head over heels, and she just wants to live in America. 
[02:48:30]  Fast forward a year.  Or this guy will be homeless.  Oh, yeah.  She'll take everything.  And she'll just be a stripper.  And all the guys are super defensive.  Somebody will be like, you know, this kind of sounds like what they say a mail-order bride is.  And the guys will be like, I told you, it's not like that.  A mail-order bride, you have to pay.  This is a dating service where I met.  Oh, bullshit.  I was commended to take my shoes off.  Not taking your shoes off when you come in to a house in Russia is just disrespectful. 
[02:49:00]  It's not Russia, lady.  It's Cleveland.  It's fucking Cleveland.  They enslave their women in houses.  Wear your outside shoes and bring in the dust and stuff inside the house.  Don't put it here, please.  Oh, okay.  It's just right next to the scene.  What?  Okay, where do you want my shoes, man?  Oh, please, I can pause this.  It's just like you right now.  Pause.  Okay.  Where do you want me to put my shoes in my house? 
[02:49:30]  In my house in America.  Right, you've been here for a long weekend so far.  Yeah.  He is so fucking like pussy whipped by her.  Yep.  And he's only video chatted with her.  Yeah.  Because you always got a grade on a curve, man.  Everyone, when they first get together with someone, it's unbelievable over the top grade.  Right.  Jesus.  And that always settles down.  So you got to factor in the settling down thing because that's where you're going to be in your relationship.  So if it starts like this, this guy is fucked.  If there's any shittiness in the first like three, two months. 
[02:50:00]  Oh.  Dunsky.  But this same couple.  Right.  At one point, they did one of those things where they were sleeping in the same bed for the first time.  And like he's telling the camera, you know, I've never slept with her before, so we'll see how this.  And they do that thing where they pan out.  They turn off the lights and then they pan out and you just hear the audio.  Uh-huh.  And you hear like two smooches.  And she goes, what are you doing?  Yeah.  Like, is it like, what are you doing?  Like, what are you doing? 
[02:50:30]  Like, he's trying to, like, maybe get something going.  And she's like, what are you doing?  Oh, then what the fuck is she here for?  She's here to do some of that sucking.  This guy is an idiot.  He's a moron.  What a dolt.  Here right now because, yeah, I don't know.  I'm going to just put those away.  Okay.  So, this is the dirt area?  Kind of.  Yeah.  Sound the rock.  Okay.  When was he that commands me to do something? 
[02:51:00]  Even if it was like mean or something, just hurry.  Take your shoes off.  Like, I can't help but laugh.  Uh-huh.  I bet you'll be laughing.  Laugh and then I do exactly as she tells me to.  Yeah.  Oh, it's adorable when she orders me to do things.  Fast forward to in the courtroom as she's like, he was the abusive, terrible husband.  I was, I didn't do anything.  Shut up.  Restraining order.  When she's banging another dude and she's like, go downstairs. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, you'll leave.  Leave my house.  She's probably already married.  Yeah.  To some Russian dude that's going to come in and just completely take over your house.  Oh, Jesus.  Muscle him out.  Right.  You'll sleep in the living room now.  Just fucking smoking.  There's a cigarette just smoking with, smoldering with a four inch ash on it.  What the fuck you do here?  No, you sleep downstairs now.  Well, just so funny because he doesn't, you know, it's my house, but they act like it's theirs.  God.  Who needs companionship that badly? 
[02:52:00]  I know.  At that point, I would rather just be by myself.  We need more food in this house.  Go out fucking, buy some food, you fuck.  Okay.  Do you have any money here?  Yeah, money.  You have the money.  Go fuck self.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  This sucks.  He's too cute to get upset with.  Oh, boy.  Maybe we could get a little shoe rack or something.  Yeah, I was thinking about that.  People can, you know, we can keep our shoes on and keep the house shoes separate and everything. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  He's talking about getting a shoe rack yesterday.  He just wore his shoes in the house.  Right.  Wherever the fuck he wanted.  Now, take them off, put them on a shoe rack.  They said 86 days before their marriage.  So this is four days.  Yes.  Four days.  Yeah.  That they've seen each other.  Yeah.  And you see the look on her face.  She's dead serious.  She has a David had sex.  There's no look of any type of want, love, lust, or passion in her eyes for this dude.  Right.  Not a piece.  No.  Let's go to the end of this clip. 
[02:53:00]  It's almost over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good job.  Maybe I wasn't raised right, but my family always wore shoes in the house and it never  bothered me.  What would happen if, like, I went and visited your parents and I just walked into the house  with my shoes on?  Mom, I would think you're crazy.  It's actually disrespectful.  I think that I have a right to change some things in my house and my life. 
[02:53:30]  It's going to be some compromises and stuff like that.  Jeez.  Fuck her.  Fuck her.  Oh my God.  This guy should run.  What a sap he is.  He's a sap.  Any other clips from that episode?  Oh.  I mean, they do all the different couples.  Right.  But she's really got him fucking jumping through.  Yo.  Oops.  This could be good.  This is the same couple.  Oh, okay.  Good.  Aziza.  It's probably my favorite couple. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  But they're in New York already.  Well, this was earlier, so.  He brought her to New York.  Right.  To be like, here's America.  Hey, look at the big cities of America.  And then two days later, he's like, and we will live in Cleveland.  But we live.  But we live somewhere else.  See, here's where we live.  Oh, man.  This is New York.  We will live in Cleveland.  Yes.  And they're in Times Square.  Yeah.  Looks like.  Yeah.  This is Aziza.  Hi, Aziza. 
[02:54:30]  She asked you to get her collared on.  Nice to meet you.  Have fun.  And I think I'm going to go walk around.  Okay.  We'll be back.  Okay.  You'll see a different person now.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  Right.  Do you see her, like, the way she looks at him when he's like, I'm going to go.  And she's like, so why aren't you gone already?  Like, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  There's nothing there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's just some shitty Times Square, like, hair place.  Yeah.  She doesn't even like this guy.  It's like, if that hair place went out of business, that would become a bodega.  Right.  You'll be right in a second.  Yeah.  Who was that guy who came with you?  It's your friend? 
[02:55:00]  That's my fiance.  Come on.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  She's smiling now.  Yeah.  No, I did.  Yeah.  That's my fiance.  To be honest, I was like, okay.  Yeah.  We're engaged.  Wow.  When I saw Mike for the first time, and I didn't like the way he looked, but when  you love somebody, and of course, you're attractive to that person, and of course, you  think that he looks really nice. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, my God.  I don't like the way he looks.  And as you're saying that, they go to a shot of him looking just horrendous.  He's all pudgy.  He's pudgy sitting on the fucking stoop.  With just horrible khaki shorts on.  Dirty sneakers.  I feel like the producers.  It almost looked like his ball bag or something.  Hang out of his gym shorts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's terrible.  I feel like the producers.  Someone's saying this girl's not Russian.  I think she's Russian.  There's people that just know accents out there, Sam Roberts. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, you think she's lying about being Russian?  Let me go to Rich.  Well, maybe it's like close enough type of place.  Like Ukrainian?  Rich, go ahead.  She said kinda.  She said compromise.  There's no Russian, you know.  Well, she's fucking very fluent in English, you can tell.  She speaks English very well.  I call Bravo Sierra on this one.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Keep going.  How could a person in another country learn the language?  They never say that.  Were she incapable of saying compromise?  Right.  Oh, you know, there's gotta be some conking man there. 
[02:56:30]  Cock-a-ra-ba.  I feel like the producers of this show are pulling the wool over that guy's eyes, making  him look bad, the same way you guys did to Dave Douglas.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  Come on.  Come on.  Dave, I thought you meant...  You like that, huh?  I love it.  Get him sitting on the stoop from across the street.  Oh, come on.  You guys said you weren't gonna shoot.  Get some roll.  Oh, you meant today.  Oh, sorry, Dave.  But next time, we'll be square.  And the only reason we're square next time is because we don't need to do it anymore. 
[02:57:00]  Right, you did it.  Yeah, it's been done.  Well, we won't do that again.  On to something new that annoys you.  Yeah, because we only wanted to do it the one time.  And you said we couldn't.  So then we had to make believe we didn't hear you properly.  It's one of my favorite things ever.  Oh, yeah.  I played him like a fucking fiddle.  Go ahead.  Oh, he's back.  Hey, sweetie.  Hi.  Hi, sweetie.  You looking good?  Yeah, right. 
[02:57:30]  What's up?  Oh, you smoked.  Now I can't feel it.  What's that?  I can feel it from here now.  You can feel it?  Yeah, just felt it.  There.  Oh.  Oh, he's going to have to.  I told him why.  He's going to have to get rid of his smoking habit.  Stop smoking.  Stop smoking.  Take your shoes off.  Can you imagine flying a girl to Russia to live with you?  Right.  And in the first day, there being any reason that she would go, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, this girl is going to use him and move on.  Oh, yeah.  And you can see it in his eyes.  It's some real shit.  You can see it in his eyes.  She won't do any.  There's nothing she could do that would make him be like, this isn't a good idea.  No.  Oh, he is in love.  Yes.  I told him a while ago that if you're going to smoke, I'm just not going to kiss you or touch  you or hug you or anything like that because it's just disgusting.  I know.  Not around you at least.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:58:30]  Okay.  Well, yeah.  I'm going to go back out, so.  Careful.  Oh, you smoked.  I did.  All right.  See you in a little bit.  Okay.  Bye.  Oh, God.  Is this guy a fucking dummy?  And you can see the disappointment in her eyes because when they were talking, they didn't  really see each other, though.  That's stupid in this day.  He must have gussied himself up for the Skype or something.  All right.  Because she is so not into what he looks like. 
[02:59:00]  Probably really low light.  She thought she was falling in love with somebody else.  Yeah, yeah.  He probably made himself seem like a real jet setter over that video chat.  This is like a sadness in her eyes.  Yeah.  There is definitely a sadness.  I went from this, you know, whatever to this is just sad.  I guess I'll just use him up until I'm all done.  Yeah.  She's stuck with this frump.  Sucked a life out of him.  Smoking cigarettes because he can't help himself.  Rotting around with his dirty shoes in his house. 
[02:59:30]  And his stupid book bag.  Yeah.  With his nuts hanging out of his gym.  His balls hanging out when he sits down on the stoop.  With his one fucking ball bag.  Scraping the sidewalk as he has his cigarette.  Nobody's touching it?  No.  Oh, God.  She said she couldn't feel that I smoked.  I don't know if that means she could smell that I smoked or she just didn't know the word  or she could feel it in her soul that I smoked.  I don't know which one it was.  And this guy, he's just like, I take the terrible. 
[03:00:00]  Awful things in my life and make them.  And, you know, yeah, make it feel funny.  Make them funny.  Fast forward.  This guy will be hanging from a raft or somewhere.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It all goes bad.  Oh, yeah.  I loved her.  Here you are.  Thank you.  Some of you are paying for her.  Nice to meet you.  You too.  Best, best, best of luck.  Be happy, guys.  Your hair looks awesome.  Thank you.  I like it, too.  Your hair looks awesome.  Awesome. 
[03:00:30]  Awesome.  We got a guy, Sal on Long Island.  Sal.  Whoa.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  All right, so my mother's friend, right?  She's a paralegal in Manhattan.  Makes a couple hundred grand a year.  Lives in a mansion in Lenox Hills in Farmingdale.  She got, she went to Portugal.  And she meets some fucking street urchins.  Some Romanian fucking street urchins.  Right?  She says she's in love.  The guy's 35 and she's 50.  She says she's in love, right?  Brings him back.  Marries him.  He's kind of a nice guy. 
[03:01:00]  But, like, he was weird because she was rich.  And you'd think, you know, you come from a shit town in Romania.  You'd come here and, like, you know, buy nice clothes and shit.  No, no, no, no.  This fucking guy wore sweatpants from Costco.  And fucking, the first time he was in there, bought blocks of cheese.  I kid you not.  And then starts cooking stew in a fucking house.  They invite us over to dinner and we walk in.  I almost fucking puked.  I was fucking horrible.  So, fast forward two years, right? 
[03:01:30]  The guy says, I don't go in Bolivia anymore.  I go do my own thing.  Leave some fucking stuff.  My own thing.  What?  Sorry.  What is that?  A pedicab?  Get in her BMW SUV and leave for six months.  And the whole time she's going, oh, he loves me.  He'll come back.  He loves me.  He'll come back.  He comes back Christmas Day.  Right?  Christmas Day.  Two days later, fucking kills himself.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, happy ending. 
[03:02:00]  But she got the car back, though?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay, good.  All right.  As long as he didn't fuck up the car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a lot of, hush smelled like fucking ass, though.  Those fucking people, at least the Europeans are gross.  They match, they match bull bag guy's personality.  Aw.  There you go.  Poor bull bag guy.  Good job, Sal.  All right, thanks, boy.  I don't have to watch that show.  Yeah, so there's that couple.  There's the one that I told you about, like the Colombian chick who lives in Oklahoma.  Uh-huh. 
[03:02:30]  Is she hot?  She's super, she's ridiculous hot.  And is he another frump?  No, the guy's not a frump, but let's just say he strikes me as a bit mysterious.  Oh.  Can we see a little of him?  But his family is very religious, and they're from, like, uh-huh, yeah.  Hence why you gotta make it look like you're...  And then the third couple, and we can pick which one you want to see a clip of, is this  adorable, like, hot little Brazilian chick.  And she comes and lives with this guy who's Mormon. 
[03:03:00]  And the first thing he does to make it so that they won't sleep together is he brings  her into his apartment and then moves a chaperone in.  So his buddy stays with them.  Oh, God, come on.  And then he moves her into his parents' house, and he stays at his place.  And so she's just this little cute Brazilian chick who has to stay at this guy's parents'  house.  What's going on there?  I don't know.  Just play it.  I'll show you the Colombian chick.  Yeah, let's see the Colombian chick.  With the mysterious guy.  Mysterious. 
[03:03:30]  In Oklahoma?  I think it's Oklahoma if I remember.  What are you, you hungry?  Yes, I am.  Well, that's going to be something neat.  Yeah.  When Powell arrived, I decided to take her to a Western restaurant called Go West.  Yeah.  It's very Oklahoman-themed, all very new to Powell.  Hi there.  Hello.  Y'all interested in cowgirl valet?  We would love a cowgirl valet.  What?  What's a cowgirl valet? 
[03:04:00]  Oh, they put you on a horse and take you from your car to the front door?  Sounds horrible.  Look at the tits on that fucking chick.  She's amazing.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  She's like how you would draw the perfect woman at 14.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Very busty.  Very busty.  Wow, wait.  And that ass, too. 
[03:04:30]  That ass.  She's cute.  The guy's got like that mysterious color on.  He's a little mysterious.  And then he's got a big, huge, over-the-top pickup truck to throw people off the scent.  He's got a fauxhawk.  A fauxhawk.  I like it.  I'll get you some boots and you'll fit right in.  Wow.  Fried cactus?  Fried cactus.  Let's try that.  No.  I'll have the tube steak and cream sauce. 
[03:05:00]  Right.  And she's just sitting there being like, like going with his friends like, oh, I love drinking  margaritas.  Who wants to drink some?  And his friends are like, we don't do that here.  He wants fried cactus because, you know, he likes pricks in his mouth.  Oh, the pricks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Pricks.  Pricks.  I figured it out.  I like that.  I'm not going to eat cactus.  Cactus.  All she wants to do is suck dick. 
[03:05:30]  That's it.  That's all she wants to do.  And they live in like his parents' house.  He's arguing over dumb cactus.  Just lay your cock on a plate and serve it to her.  Serve it up.  They showed like, he moved her into his parents' house.  They both live in his parents' house, but they sleep in separate rooms because that's  what his parents want.  And like she, you know, sneaks into his room at night and he goes, get back to your room.  My parents are right downstairs.  We just, you got it. 
[03:06:00]  Come on.  You can't.  Not now.  No.  Oh, boy.  It's like, oh, no.  Very mysterious.  Very.  Calf fries?  Yes.  Calf fries.  What is that?  Calf fries?  I won't tell you what that is.  The best thing, though.  It's from the cow, but what part of the cow?  It's just really good.  It's just a meat.  It's real tender.  It's good.  It's got it.  It's got breading on it.  We have a gravy that we dip it with. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  We're going to try it.  We're going to try the calf fries?  Yeah.  Okay.  Calf fries.  Let's make a testicle.  Is it testicles?  He loves them.  Oh, no.  It's really good.  Mm.  Okay.  Why are you smiling like so?  Mm.  Calf fries are calf testicles.  Oh, he loves testicles. 
[03:07:00]  He loves them.  He loves calf testicles.  Look, he's got two on the bridge of his nose.  He loves them so much.  They are really good.  Oh, they're delicious.  With extra blue cheese, please.  He loves fucking calf balls.  Could you just fling the blue cheese at my face?  Who the fuck loves calf balls?  This guy.  This dude with his orange V-deck.  And he got his fucking dumb chick to eat it.  And now she's going to get all pissed off, right? 
[03:07:30]  Right.  I don't know anything about this dude.  I just know Macklemore would accept him.  Oh, so accepting.  Yes.  Just meat?  That's all?  I like it.  It's good.  It is.  Wait, yes.  Okay.  They're cow, little baby cow testicles.  Mm.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, Rosie, you kidding me?  I think I'm going to throw it out. 
[03:08:00]  For sure.  You're fine.  You enjoyed it until I told you.  No.  You're kidding me.  I'll get some beer.  Mm.  Oh.  Do you want to let me even put your balls in my mouth?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, my parents are right down the hall.  Let's get some more calf testicles.  We need some calf fries.  I would throw my mom out the window.  Are you kidding me?  Getting that ass.  If that chick showed up at your house?  Right. 
[03:08:30]  Jesus.  I would give her a good boot.  Yeah.  Right out the fucking door.  Yeah.  Guess what you're going to be up all night listening to, mom.  Yeah, me fucking listening.  Guess you got earplugs, man.  You see the tits on this one?  Look at this chick.  Oh, my mom and dad are down the hall.  They're right downstairs.  She flew from Columbia to Oklahoma City.  Right.  Yeah.  To get this dick.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to say.  Yeah.  They're right downstairs.  They're downstairs.  They're downstairs.  We don't want to upset him. 
[03:09:00]  Mr. Hyatt.  That's fine.  I'm going to have to search that out there.  Yeah.  You got to watch that.  It's so obvious.  It's a bunch of losers.  Yeah.  It's so great.  And then these girls, this is their end to the stage.  All they have to do is stay married a little bit, and then they can divorce and go and  do whatever the fuck they want, right?  Yeah.  You want to see this other chick real quick?  Yeah.  Let's see what she looks like.  What is this one now?  This is the cute little Brazilian chick who is going to marry a Mormon guy, so they can't  have sex before marriage.  So his first step was to move in a chaperone, because I guess he just can't keep his dick 
[03:09:30]  in his pants.  Oh, he wants it, but...  Oh, really?  And then the second step was he moved her in to his parents' house.  Parents' house?  Yeah.  So dad can get all that goodness out of him?  Kira Liam and I just got back from Brazil, and she's only been living in Los Angeles  now for three days. 
[03:10:00]  So we still have a good chunk of the 90 days left.  What's this?  That's what heats the water.  Oh!  Yeah.  Oh, no!  She still has to get acclimated more.  Dude, this one is one of my favorites.  Civilization?  She doesn't know what running water is?  She has no idea that this guy's a turd, but it's going to be a year down the road where  she's going to realize she's a hot chick, and now she's in America, and this guy's a 
[03:10:30]  loser.  Yeah, just because he's got a hot water heater doesn't make him a big deal.  She doesn't know that now.  She was ready to just shit in the hot water heater room.  It's going to quickly have to be a Mercedes.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She'll learn real fast.  The hot water is impressing her now, day three.  Yeah, hot water.  She's impressed by the hot water.  She's going to take half that hot water tank.  Oh, fuck yeah.  C is for cold.  H is for hot.  Okay.  She's still got language to learn. 
[03:11:00]  What does that say?  Coup.  Coup.  Coup.  Coup.  Wow.  In normal circumstances, if someone was acclimating to a new culture, they'd want to have  a nice, smooth transition.  More.  More.  More.  More.  More.  More.  That won't necessarily be the case for Keeling.  You want to see what's in the fridge?  I know how to work.  Nothing.  Nothing.  We'll have to go shopping today. 
[03:11:30]  I'm worried that Keeling is going to experience a lot of culture shock.  Simple as that.  I'm worried.  That means he's worried about other dudes.  Dudes.  That's exactly what that means.  She's real cute.  Because in LA, a girl that looks like that is not even fucking saying hi to you.  Yeah.  That's what he's worried about.  Like, he's worried, yeah, that she's going to find out that she's hot.  A culture shock, I call it.  I call it the shock of when another guy comes and picks her up and she realizes I'm a tool.  That has more money and has more than a hot water heater. 
[03:12:00]  But I have a hot water heater.  I bought you a special coop.  A coop.  Yeah.  But dear, I got a hot water heater.  Who's that guy?  Macklemore.  Was that Macklemore?  Some dude just waved at us.  Was it Macklemore?  Go find out.  All right.  Hang on.  I think it's Macklemore.  Macklemore indeed.  Yo, Macklemore!  Yo, Mackle!  Mackle.  The other way.  Accepting Macklemore.  Yeah, he went the other way. 
[03:12:30]  Where's Sam walking off to?  Why does he have to go all the way that way?  I don't know.  Can't he go the way the guy walked to see who he is?  Sam is an idiot.  Where'd he go?  I don't know.  It's fine.  Whatever.  What are you going to do?  And he just walks.  Yeah.  Look, he's like, I don't know.  And he's scratching his big fuzzy head.  He has no idea?  No.  Why wouldn't you go that way and see who it was?  That way!  He's shaking his head like, oh.  Now he's going the way he's supposed to.  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  But it's too late now.  It is too late.  The guy waved at us like he knows who we are.  He kind of looked like Macklemore-ish.  I don't know.  Look at Donnie Wicklin coming up.  Right.  He looks like he's ready to collect some fucking money from somebody.  Looks like he's.  And he'll smash your knuckles with a wrench.  Looks like he works down at the docks.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like a longshoreman.  Look at him.  You want sunglasses?  Why is he mad?  I don't know.  Everyone's just pissed off in this place. 
[03:13:30]  It's great.  That honeymoon's over, I guess.  Oh, yeah, right?  That didn't take long.  That didn't take long.  Who was that?  Macklemore.  It's not, right?  No, it's not.  Who was it?  It's an awesome new country act named Cole Swindle.  Who's Cole Swindle?  He's an awesome new country act.  I am Cole Swindle.  Why was he waving at us?  That's my name, Cole Swindle.  The hell was he waving at us for? 
[03:14:00]  I don't know.  He's got a song called Chillin' It.  It's like Fan in that picture.  Let's hear Chillin' It.  All right, I guess he was just...  I'm Chillin' It.  Taking my...  That's not the song.  Thrilling it, no?  All right.  Enough of Cole Swindle.  Why'd you stop getting so mad?  Why don't you guys just chillin'?  I'm Cole Swindle.  I'm happy to be here.  Cole Swindle.  Cole Swindle.  Is that a made-up name?  To be famous?  No. 
[03:14:30]  You sure?  No.  Oh, and if one more person had sent me that stupid, unfunny Arnold Schwarzenegger at the  fucking gym thing.  What did you see he had a fake mustache on?  You don't like that?  Several.  You don't like that?  It wasn't fucking funny.  Why?  You don't like that?  It was so badly done.  You got to work your arms.  Oh, really, Arnold Schwarzenegger?  There's a camera crew here.  He's following you around.  It wasn't done very well. 
[03:15:00]  No.  He's undercover.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Undercover.  All right.  He's getting ready for that ping pong match.  That's right.  I am playing King Kong in Hong Kong.  What does he use as a paddle?  You're kidding me.  All right.  Well, what are we going to do?  We're going to go home.  Yeah.  We've got to get the fuck out of this jerk.  All right, y'all.  Who's in tomorrow?  Cole Swindle.  A little Cole Swindle action. 
[03:15:30]  Nice.  Who else?  Dr. Ian Smith is in tomorrow.  All right.  So what weigh-in is going to happen with the boys?  Yep.  I don't know how to tell them that the Nutribullet people reached out to me.  Well, you can tell them that he better fucking hurry up his sweatshop laborers.  Yeah, what are they doing?  His blenders.  A bunch of little Chinese kids with soldering irons fucking in the sweatshop that's making his  fucking blenders.  I'm 100%.  It's that crack of whip, motherfucker.  I'm trying to hang in there, but I'm getting weak.  Yeah.  Nutribullet people are tweeting me now.  Yeah.  Bump up your workers to six cents an hour. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  See what kind of production you get.  Yeah, he needs some chinis.  Yeah.  He's got to get those chinis to build his blenders.  Fucking build that shit.  Lickety split.  Right.  And I might be wrong, but I think Penn Jillette's tomorrow.  Is that Penn's tomorrow?  Yes, he is.  Eight o'clock.  That means we don't have to talk tomorrow.  And we'll talk.  None of the old prepola to do.  Yeah.  Whatsoever.  A little rolly.  But entertaining is all hell.

I don't know what that means.  Make sure you're chilling it when you do.  We're going to chill in it.  We're chilling it.  He said be cool instead of chilling it.  Chilling it.  You ready to take a mushroom stamp tomorrow, Rowan?  Yeah, I'm ready for his blender.  I decided.  His what?

Don, why are you pissed?  What's the matter, Don?  What?  Why are you pissed?  What's the matter?  You walk around the halls like you're angry.  That was the bird he just flipped.  Why are you pissed?  Uh-oh.  You're out there, too.  Uh-oh.  People are angry.  Uh-oh.  What happened? 
[03:18:30]  Is it that George Costanza tactic where you look like you're annoyed because then people  think you're busy?  Yeah.  So you're just always...  Brilliant.  It is.  Eric knows.  Eric, why are they pissed?  B-Rock.  What's the scuttlebutt?  He's not saying anything.  Oh, boy.  He's walking around.  I saw him literally walk by here three times.  I think so.  And he goes...  He shakes his head.  And Tim's assistant is out there, too.  That's not good.  I don't know what that's all about.  Tim leaving already?  I wouldn't blame him.  I'll tell you one thing. 
[03:19:00]  I ain't fucking standing around for a meeting.  I gotta go.  You always gotta go.  I've gotta go.  It's Monday.  I gotta work out.  No one believes you gotta go anymore.  I know.  They never believe me.  Because you used it too many times.  I swear, I got a trainer.  And now it's even worse, because leave time is later.  Right.  So I get home.  And the Super Bowl stuff is all shut down on the streets.  Well, not for me.  I'm just going eastbound.  We just make it.  We just make it.  I go eastbound.  Now it's even worse.  It could be 11.15 by the time you get home. 
[03:19:30]  That's true.  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  You know what we have?  I need a nap before workout.  I take a quick power nap.  How long is the power nap?  Three hours.  No.  Because I'm a nice guy?  Yeah.  I lost a booger around here somewhere today.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Be on the lookout.  Keep your fingers out of there.  You throw out the console.  Yep.  You gotta throw it away like the booger couch.  See you tomorrow.  Who Kid?  There's a booger over there.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  We went viral, brother.  Me and the Who Kid went the viral route.

[03:20:30]  Yeah, wow.  Fuck her.  She was at the Knicks game with 50.  Oh, but she was doing...  Why aren't she like Meryl Streep?  Meryl Streep poses with her.  Doesn't she want to make that movie?  That NRA?  Yes.  Anti-NRA movie?  Yes.  Fuck her and her ass.  She was...  She was...  Did he?  Is that confirmed to a kid?  He came...  We live.  I don't know.
