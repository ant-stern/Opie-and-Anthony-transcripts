<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a barrage of commercials for various products and services, including automotive businesses, home improvement companies, a vision improvement method, and weight loss products. The show then launched into its characteristically chaotic style, beginning with a discussion of a malfunctioning Manhattan traffic light system, quickly descending into vulgar jokes about drivers and societal dependence on technology.  A bizarre story about a cockroach emerging from a woman's tongue after licking a stamp was recounted, followed by the introduction of "Whip Them Out Wednesday," a segment involving displaying genitalia from vehicles.  The hosts then shifted to discussing the newly installed studio carpet, the discovery of a petrified mouse (a relic from a previous mouse-eating segment), and a contest offering a couple a chance to have sex on the new carpet in exchange for a spot on a future "Sex with Sam" segment.  A caller even volunteered to eat the petrified mouse.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a series of phone calls with Frenchie, who was en route to a "WOW" fan fest in Philadelphia with two companions described as "retarded Laverne and Shirley" in a limousine.  Frenchie’s calls were filled with increasingly desperate pleas for his companions to stop their incessant, mundane chatter, punctuated by his use of vulgar language and expressions of a desire to die.  He even contacted "Uncle John" for help, receiving equally unhelpful advice.  The hosts played audio of these calls, highlighting Frenchie's escalating frustration and the unrelenting noise from the limo.  Meanwhile, the hosts discussed Intern John's ATM card being used in the Dominican Republic, a disastrous stock market investment with a former boss described as a "cheap Jew," and their own past financial struggles, including a paltry raise from their former boss "Brucie" after a period of high ratings. Several callers shared similar accounts of racial intimidation during high school sports, echoing the hosts' own experiences.  The segment ended with the anticipation of the arrival of the carpet-sex contest winners and the mention of upcoming guest Barry Williams and a discussion of credit card scams.

The next major segment focused on two key issues: Opie and Anthony's disastrous stock option investment with American Radio Systems (later American Tower), which resulted in a significant loss compared to their promised return, and their carpet-sex contest.  The hosts expressed extreme frustration and used vulgar language to describe their financial disappointment.  The second half of this segment focused on the arrival of the couple, Brett and Ann, who had agreed to have sex on the new carpet for a trip to Las Vegas, Nassau, or Hilton Head.  Barry Williams, present in the studio, participated in the conversation, sharing personal anecdotes and promoting the upcoming release of a Peter Gabriel song. The hosts repeatedly made crude jokes about the couple’s impending sexual act throughout the segment.  Numerous advertisements were interspersed throughout.

The subsequent portion featured a detailed account of Brett and Ann's attempt to fulfill the carpet-sex contest, with explicit descriptions and jokes from the hosts and Barry Williams. This was interwoven with a discussion of the sudden death of Dave Williams, the lead singer of Drowning Pool, which prompted a discussion about other deceased celebrities they had interviewed. Numerous commercials aired throughout this segment, including for Wesson oil, Stoli Citrona, Stacker 2, and various other products and services.  A segment discussing an audio clip of "blind boxing" and a lengthy discussion of the website "formerchildstar.net" also took place. The broadcast culminated with Brett and Ann successfully completing the contest, winning their trip, and leaving the studio staff to clean up the resulting mess.

The final segment began with commercials for STS Tire and Auto Centers and Stacker 2, followed by a promotion for the *Oblivious* game show.  The focus then shifted to promoting the WOW Philly fan party, highlighting the involvement of several individuals, including Rich Voss, Frenchie, "the retarded Laverne and Shirley," Octane, DJ Jackie Bam Bam, and Cousin Ed, with Barry Williams present in the studio.  Barry Williams also promoted trips to Las Vegas, Nassau, and Hilton Head Island through a Club de Soleil promotion.  A significant portion detailed the technical difficulties experienced during a live remote broadcast from the Philly event, involving significant audio issues with Rich Voss's microphone. Frenchie was dispatched to fix the technical problems, leading to further frustration and expletive-laden commentary from the hosts.  The audio eventually connected, briefly capturing heckling from the audience directed at "the retarded Laverne and Shirley." Barry Williams discussed his upcoming appearance on *Fear Factor*. The broadcast concluded with lingering technical issues, post-show commentary, more commercials, listener calls recounting observations from the Philly event, final thoughts from Frenchie, and closing remarks from the hosts.

Hi, this is Jerry Robbins of Robbins Diamonds.  A guy came in the store last week and told me he was getting engaged,  but needed a ring to make it official.  He didn't have a lot to spend, and he'd been trudging through malls  trying to find out that truly perfect ring.  But he kept coming across the same old, same old, at store after store.  He always ended up at the food court with no ring and hot sticky buns all over his face and hands. 
[00:01:00]  I smiled, invited him to sit down and relax.  He found her a magnificent ring for less than 500 bucks.  You see, Robbins Diamonds is not an ordinary jewelry store.  Engagement rings are what we do, and we do it better.  There's more selection at Robbins, at any price range,  because we really believe you can't put a dollar sign on love.  So if you're getting engaged, remember, malls are for hot sticky buns and the same old, same old.  You can find her the perfect ring that will rock her world at a price that won't rock yours.  Come to Robbins Diamonds, where the rocks rock and romance rules, 
[00:01:30]  in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.  Home of tax-free shopping.  Rock that Robbins Diamonds.  A card above the rest, yeah.  Just about every day now, people are asking me how they may help improve their vision safely and effectively,  and without the risk of expensive laser surgery.  I'm Dr. Henry Ettinger, and I've been recommending the See Clearly method for two years now,  and I'm here to tell you it works.  It wasn't long ago that I was beginning to need glasses myself,  but using the See Clearly method has kept me out of glasses. 
[00:02:00]  The standard approach to vision care has been to buy stronger and stronger glasses as our vision gets worse.  However, glasses just treat the symptoms and don't fix the problem.  The See Clearly method is a natural program designed by optometrists  who say the program may help you and your family start improving your vision at home safely and effectively.  In just minutes a day, you may be seeing clearer, sharper, and better than you ever thought possible.  I know. It works for me, and it works for my patients.  Call 1-800-900-0016 for your free video on the See Clearly method. 
[00:02:30]  That's 1-800-900-0016.  1-800-900-0016.  Pete has no cat beak.  He has no mule ears.  He has no seal tail.  Hi, I'm John Land, president of Frontline Phonics,  and that little boy reading is in preschool.  Every day I talk with parents just like you,  who are looking for a way to make learning to read fun and easy. 
[00:03:00]  With our program, your child can start reading words after only five letters,  and books after only eight letters.  And within just three and a half weeks, he can be reading his first book.  It's that easy.  Developed by teachers,  Frontline Phonics is rated as the number one beginning reading program in the nation  by the education source.  In fact, three of my own children learned to read with this program before starting kindergarten.  Call 1-800-YES-READ,  and I'll rush you a free video showing you how other children are having success with reading every day. 
[00:03:30]  Don't wait.  Call 1-800-YES-READ.  1-800-YES-READ.  So I'm at the pool checking out the hot lifeguard.  What the hell else would I be doing at the pool?  When this shadow seems to come over me,  next thing you know, I'm in the shade.  I thought it was a cloud,  then I looked up,  no, it's somebody who needs stack or two,  the world's strongest fat burner.  Personally, it just wasn't something that I wanted to see in a bikini,  or should never even be in a bikini in the first place.  That should have been your first sign.  But when you're blocking the rays of the sun,  you need to burn some of that fat off. 
[00:04:00]  And the heat's not going to do it, but stack or two will.  It's the world's strongest fat burner.  It's a little yellow capsule.  You take it 45 minutes later,  it literally burns the fat off of your body.  Next thing you know,  people will be able to see the sun around your fat ass,  because your ass won't be as fat.  You'll be eating less.  Did I mention stack or two also crushes your cravings?  And stack or two gives you an all-natural extra boost of energy.  So get your fat ass on stack or two,  and get out of my way so I can check out the hot lifeguard.  Pick it up!  1-800-LIGHTLINE, www.stacker2.com. 
[00:04:30]  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Also available on Stacker 2 Lite.  Available at GNC, Rite Aid, Eckerdt, CVS, and other fine stores.

Pull your pants down.  Ew.  You got bad eyes.  You'll be a deafening show.  Number three.  Pop up your toothbrush.  You're all burning in hell.  Damn you.  Alcohol equals great radio.  Are you not entertained? 
[00:07:00]  Making the First Amendment seem like a bad idea.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Take your balls and take it off now.  Flip them out.  Flip them out.  Flip them out.  Flip them out.  Flip them out.  Flip them out.  Flip them out.  Flip them out.  Flip them out. 
[00:07:30]  Yep.  Flip them out.  Yep.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  We can't F around today.  We got way too much going on.  Yeah.  It is whip them out Wednesday.  Yes.  It is.  And it's 100 degrees in Manhattan today.  Very hot.  100 degrees in New York City today.  Traffic lights aren't working.  Everyone's losing their effing minds on the streets of New York today. 
[00:08:00]  Because people are stupid.  No, it's not about stupid people today.  No, it is.  Some kind of computer system went down.  I know.  And lights are not turning green out there.  I know.  I had to drive in and I experienced this.  And people still are stupid.  If you're sitting at a light and it's red and it ain't turned green for quite a while,  go!  I will use any excuse to go through a red light.  And if you're sitting there...  And here's another thing that the computer eff up here in Manhattan is doing to the lights. 
[00:08:30]  It'll turn green for you.  In a second it'll go green.  Yellow, red.  The green was there for two seconds.  Are you stopping for that red, knowing now that the light is broken?  No.  You go.  But these rubes and these old people, it's always old people,  are stopped there and I'm behind going, the light's broken.  I saw one intersection where it was a standstill.  Of course.  Everyone was stopped and no one knew what to do.  People are stupid.  Everyone's just looking at each other like, well, uh, I don't know. 
[00:09:00]  Uh, maybe I should...  No, maybe you should go...  Uh...  Oh boy, big decision here.  Don't want to blow this decision.  Oh no, I gotta make a decision.  The automated decision maker isn't working.  It's broken.  Now I gotta use my brain to figure it out.  Oh no.  Usually there's multicolored lights that instruct me as what to do.  Now it's not here.  It ain't working.  What do I do?  Here's a cop on a bicycle and he's gonna help all of us. 
[00:09:30]  Hmm.  Should I slowly go through the intersection?  Avoiding any danger and thus continuing my journey?  Or should I just sit here until the problem is fixed?  I better jot down my ideas.  Oh no.  And try to figure it out.  The lights are broken.  You know what you do?  You look, you look left, you look right, and then you slowly roll through the intersection.  If another car is slowly rolling through the other way, you either stop and let him go  and then continue, or he stops and you go. 
[00:10:00]  There's no reason to sit there and stop unless you're retarded.  All that makes a lot of sense, but it just shows how retarded we are as a society.  We got all this stuff that helps us with our daily routines.  And then we freak out when it breaks.  When it breaks down.  We freak the F out.  The lights break.  You can still, you can look.  You can look for the danger.  You could look left and right.  You could see the guy to the left is looking left and right.  And then you slowly move forward.  You're through the intersection. 
[00:10:30]  You continue on your way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It probably should, theoretically, if people thought like that, it should work better than  the lights.  No, but they don't.  It should work more efficiently because everyone's slowly moving.  And then you got the a-holes.  They know what to do.  And they're, they're honking like lunatic.  That's me.  I'm behind the people going, go.  It's broken.  I know.  You're screaming.  It's never going to turn.  It's not going to turn.  People think, they honestly think they're going to get a ticket for going through a broken  red light.  There's a point where you have to say to yourself, you know, you know, I don't think the light's 
[00:11:00]  going to turn green.  I'm going to take the bull by the horns on this one.  I've been sitting here for five minutes.  Yeah.  I think I'm on to something here.  I commute through here every day and I've never been on a line this long for a light.  Right.  And I've never, I know this light.  I know its name.  And I've never seen it stay red this long.  But I best just simmer down and wait here.  It's just hilarious when our computers break down in our society.  Oh, we lose our mind.  What about last summer when the ATM machines went down? 
[00:11:30]  No one knew what to do.  No one could get their cash.  No one could get their cash.  And everyone was just wandering the streets of New York in this area just trying to figure  it out.  I can't buy nothing.  Maybe there's a bank.  I've got to go to a teller.  I've got to go to a real life teller.  And then you start asking people, do they still have tellers?  You don't know.  Do they have that?  I've got to fill out a withdrawal slip.  What's that?  I don't even know my account number.  Do you know your account number to write it down on a withdrawal slip? 
[00:12:00]  No effing idea.  No.  You know, I didn't even know how much a stamp was until recently.  What's that?  Who mails things?  And people thought I was crazy because I didn't know.  When was the last time I mailed the letter?  I don't remember.  I don't even mail my bills.  I do my bills on the computer.  And I'm not even kidding, okay?  I think it's...  Uh-oh.  Is it 37 cents?  Or did it go up?  No, I think you're right.  It's 37 cents, right?  Is it?  A stamp?  Whoa.  I couldn't even tell you. 
[00:12:30]  People thought I was insane because I didn't know that.  Well, I'm not writing my relatives in Maine.  Dear Bill, how's Maine?  When was the last time you licked a stamp?  Actually, the last stamp I used wasn't a licking kind.  It was the peel-off sticky kind.  Oh, you don't lick them anymore?  Didn't you hear what happened?  Dude, you can't lick stamps or envelopes.  You can't.  This girl I know, she knows this person that got a paper cut from licking the envelope on her tongue. 
[00:13:00]  Right?  She licked the stamp.  It started swelling up a little bit.  So she goes to the doctor.  The doctor goes, it's nothing.  It's just a little infection.  Here's some penicillin.  She takes the penicillin.  Ain't going away.  A few days later, it's really swollen.  She could barely close her mouth.  Goes back to the doctor.  The doctor goes, we're going to lance that.  Cuts it open.  What comes out?  A full-grown cockroach.  Apparently, cockroaches laid their eggs in the adhesive to the envelopes. 
[00:13:30]  And they were delivered in the incision in her tongue.  And it grew to be a full-size cockroach.  True story.  True story.  I didn't get past the fact that you don't lick stamps anymore.  No.  I don't like licking.  There's no licking anymore?  I don't like licking anything that comes like that from a store or something.  You don't know where the hell that crap's been.  See, we work.  We love using that word, work.  Let me lift this.  Oh, God. 
[00:14:00]  That's heavy.  We work in a corporate environment, so we all cheat on our mailing and stuff.  I just run stuff through the machines and stuff.  You use the company's...  Yeah, why not?  I figure they owe me.  That's a no-no.  That's a no-no.  Are you going to fess up to stealing satellite signals like Sid Rosenberg here in New York?  Our old pal Sid Rosenberg.  You're not fessing up to that?  All right.  So our computers have broken down in Manhattan, and people are losing their minds.  But it is whip them out Wednesday, Anthony.  Yes, that'll make everything better, because even if you're stuck in a light behind some 
[00:14:30]  jack-off that won't go through the red light, even though it's broken, you never know.  If you have a wow on your vehicle, that girl might be coming up on the other side, and she'll  see the wow.  And now you'll have plenty of time, as you're stopped at that light, for the girl to look  at you and flash those lovely cans, because you decided to put a wow on your vehicle.  And I have a feeling that a lot of people out there are taking a wow, you know, they're  not taking it seriously, Anthony.  Not taking it seriously?  No.  No.  Summer's going to be over. 
[00:15:00]  And then we go into a wow hiatus, almost.  Right.  Yeah.  Because the weather gets dark by the time we're on the air.  Right now, it's wow season.  Yeah, so get your wow in your vehicle and enjoy the wow season, because it's going to be  over before you know it.  All right?  Right.  Right.  Well, we have lots to talk about today, Anthony.  We had new carpet installed.  We don't have a new midday show here in New York, but golly gee, we got new carpet.  They're literally working from the floor up on this place, hoping.  Yes, they are.  They started with new carpeting.  I see this, and I hear a very, very nervous Pete Johnson is walking around instructing anybody 
[00:15:30]  to the penalties of spilling on this new carpet.  Yeah, so Pete wants to come in here and give the rules, I guess.  He's losing his mind.  And you know what they found?  What?  They found a petrified mouse.  A petrified mouse.  From one of our past shows.  Wow.  For the old faithful listeners, remember the guy that came in and ate the mice for the  trip to Hawaii?  The white mice. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, he went to the pet store, he got some white mice.  Remember one got away?  One did indeed run away.  Well, three years later, we found him.  Did we find the petrified mouse in Martini Steve's studio?  It was in Martini Steve's studio?  Yes.  Is it still in the wastebasket near the coffee machine?  That's where they dumped it, but we want to save it.  Why do we want to save that?  Huh?  Why do we want to save the petrified mouse?  Because we want to.  All right. 
[00:16:30]  Are we getting Steve in here?  Yeah.  Yeah, Martini Steve.  Hi, Steve.  Hi, Hope.  Hi, Ant.  How you doing there, Martini Steve?  Not thirsty.  So, they found a mouse in your studio?  Yeah, it happened before I got in this morning.  Apparently, the guys that were putting the new carpet down found a dead, stiff, very old 
[00:17:00]  mouse under one of the tape decks in my studio.  You sure it was one of ours?  From what Jimmy said, it sounds like one of those feeder mice that you guys were doing  a bit with.  Yeah.  That was like three years ago, I think.  He said it was a really small, white fur mouse.  Oh, yeah.  That sounds like him.  Sounds like the one that escaped.  Yeah, well, I mean, what other explanation would there be for one mouse being found on  the ninth floor?  Yeah.  So.  All right.  That's all you got.  Thank you.  All right. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  We're waiting for Pete to tell us about the new rug, Anthony.  Yeah.  But someone on line two has a great idea for the new carpet.  Manuel.  Yes, Hopi.  What's up?  Yeah.  I have a good idea about tomorrow for Sex with Sam.  Have a couple to do backdoor action on the rug.  That's a wonderful idea, you know.  During Sex with Sam, we can christen the carpet with a little chowder. 
[00:18:00]  Why wait for tomorrow?  We need a couple to christen the new rug today.  All right.  Yeah.  A little prelude to Sex for Sam.  We need one brave couple out there to come on down and christen the brand new rug in the  studio.  And if you want in for Sex for Sam, this would be your way to get in, I believe.  Yeah.  Very good.  Can the couple be girl on girl?  As long as it's not guy on guy.  Right.  All right.  So we're looking for a couple to have sex on our rug today just to drive Pete nuts because 
[00:18:30]  he was worried about spilling coffee on the rug.  Don't spill anything.  This carpeting is very expensive and I don't retire for another 11 months.  Ten and a half he's down to.  I want it nice.  Yeah.  So Sex for Sam 3 is tomorrow.  I know a lot of couples have been calling and emailing.  They want in on this contest tomorrow.  Here's your way to get in on the contest.  First couple to come down here and have sex on the rug to christen our brand new rug  will be in on the contest tomorrow.  Is definitely in for Sex for Sam tomorrow? 
[00:19:00]  Yes.  Great.  Okay.  So we need a couple to come down here right now.  This is your guaranteed way to get in to Sex for Sam 3 and try to win that spot to join  us at the Sam Adams Brewery up in Boston.  And I'm going to make Pete watch.  Oh, I can't watch that.  No.  He'll start like giggling all nervous.  No, I can't.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Hey.  What's up?  Yeah, I want to eat the petrified mouth to hang out with you guys. 
[00:19:30]  Shut up.  If you guys could throw in some free tickets, that would be cool, too.  But I'll eat it.  All right, hold on.  What do we got?  Do we have the mouse?  Hold on.  And talk for a second.  But can't he die from that?  We really have to look into some of these things.  I don't know.  Isn't that how people got the bubonic plague?  They threw the mouse out.  Oh, they did.  They threw it out.  The carpet guys threw it away? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Is it in the garbage?  Garbage.  It's gone.  Downstairs?  That garbage is gone.  Garbage is gone.  In the dumpster?  No, I'm just asking.  Where is it?  Where does the garbage go after Eddie picks it up?  You found them?  Who knows?  That's one of the great mysteries of this place.  No, I think they threw it away, Chris.  You can't.  I don't think you could do that, though.  I think you'll get, like, some kind of disease.  Well, Chris, if we find the mouse, call back, okay? 
[00:20:30]  Because we will search for it.  Thank you.  No problem.  Okay.  Anthony, we also want to talk about, I have a thing on stocks.  Yeah.  But before that, you know what's going on in Philly today?  No.  Rich Voss is down there.  Okay.  Sorry about that, Philly.  The retard Laverne Shirley.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  That's right.  Now I know.  And Frenchie.  And Frenchie.  They're doing some kind of wow fan fest starting at 530.  Star-studded, huh?  Yeah, and I think we're going to be hooked up so we can see what's going on down there. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  I think we hooked up with Zephyr.  The Zephyr system?  We broke out the Zephyr for this.  The Zephyr system.  Yeah.  So when the retard Laverne Shirley hit the stage, we can see what it's all about.  And when Frenchie hits the stage, and hopefully when Rich Voss hits the stage, hopefully if the technology will work.  Well, we put Frenchie and the retard Laverne Shirley in a limo about an hour ago.  And sent them down to Philly. 
[00:21:30]  They're en route.  Now I hear the limo driver, after 20 minutes, downstairs, was ready to run himself over with his own limo.  Well, the problem was that the two retards, Di and Marion, were supposed to be here at 1.  They showed up at 11 and went drinking.  They were drinking at 11.  Well, they claimed they didn't, but I could totally tell.  Absolutely.  That lady, Di, is a raging drunk, and I'm sure she was hammered by noon.  And, of course, you know, Frenchie shows up right when he's supposed to. 
[00:22:00]  But they managed to find the limo and sit in there for, you know, the 20 minutes, you know, from like 1230 to around 1.  I can't believe I'm a limo fiend.  I'm a limo fiend.  It's a limo fiend.  Isn't this great?  I bet they're doing all dopey limo things, like opening the sunroof and trying to stick their fat troll bodies through the hall.  Woo!  Holding on to a bottle of champagne.  Woo!  That could be kind of fun, though.  So, you just want to open fire on anybody doing that. 
[00:22:30]  So, Richard, the limo driver, calls me because Frenchie had just got up here and he'd come up to the office.  And he's like, hey, you know, could you hurry up a little bit, you know?  I mean, I said, all right, no problem.  I get down there, and Earl came down with me.  And he goes, is this an act?  These two are driving me nuts.  They wouldn't shut up, right?  They wouldn't shut up.  I just told him, I'm like, you know, you put up the divide or whatever.  And he was just, you know.  With that said, Frenchie's on the line.  All right.  Calling from the limo.  And all it says on the phone screen is, I want to kill myself. 
[00:23:00]  Usually he likes to kill other people.  He just wants to kill himself.  Yes, Ben?  The other thing was, too, is Frenchie gets in the limo, and it took about two seconds for Frenchie to call Marion a C,  which Marion replied back, well, at least you don't have one.  That was her comeback.  And we're taping this whole thing, right?  I think we're trying to get tape of Frenchie and the retard of the burn Shirley going at it in the limo as they go to Philly.  Frenchie!  I want to kill myself.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you very much. 
[00:23:30]  How is the ride been?  Shut the hell up, you whore!  Guys, it takes quite a down one, you whore man, too!  Listen, I'm two feet away from those two messes, and I want to punch them, one in the face and one in the ass.  And tell you what, the driver wants to kill himself as much as I do.  We went to a resting area about ten minutes ago.  Yeah.  I said, what do you think of those two messes?  He said, oh, they're for real.  They're actually for real, those two.  This is almost unbelievable, man. 
[00:24:00]  So they won't shut up, right?  Exactly.  They're talking to me.  I'm talking to you right now.  They can hear what I'm telling you.  And I mean, they can hear what you're saying.  And they're like just talking to me.  Yeah, you can hear them in the background.  They don't shut up.  Shut the ass up.  What?  You see, suckers?  Shut up!  Poor Frenchy, man.  You whore man!  This is in hell.  This is Frenchy payback.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, they binged me out right now. 
[00:24:30]  I want to actually jump off the car right now.  During 50 miles an hour, I think I'd be better off on the road.  Frenchy, are you drinking?  Yeah, I was drinking, but I stopped because they're really, really annoying.  And by the way, Lady Di is drinking, too.  I think it's going somewhere, I think.  Oh, she is?  Oh, yeah.  I have some priceless stuff, actually.  I'll tell you that right now.  So she's probably drunk off her ass.  Oh, yeah.  Now she's drinking water.  But I don't think it's water.  It's vodka in the bar.  It probably is a vodka. 
[00:25:00]  Stupid whore.  Frenchy.  Shut up!  I love this.  He's in hell.  Frenchy, how far from Philly are you?  We just got off the highway.  We're in Trenton.  In Trenton.  Okay.  So, I don't know why the F am I, but don't worry.  We're just too retarded.  It doesn't really matter.  All right.  Hey, Frenchy, tell Lady Di we don't want to talk to her because she is banned from this  show.  I don't know why she's doing gigs for our show.  I know.  I guess we're desperate or something.  Hold on.  No, no, no.  No, no. 
[00:25:30]  We don't want...  What?  We don't want Lady Di.  Give us a million.  I don't want you, Lady Di, okay?  Shut up.  Shut your mouth.  You should be sucking seer.  That's all you should do, you whore.  Shut up.  Keep your mouth busy, you twat.  Suck it, you whore.  You want me to open it and put it on your mouth, you whore.  I give you the Roman helmet, you whore.  Sorry, guys.  I almost said it.  Did you say it or not?  He goes, I give you the Roman helmet.  No, I did not say it.  I almost said it.  Okay.  You didn't say it. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  No, I didn't say it.  Let's talk to Marion.  All right.  You want to talk to Marion?  Hold on one second.  All right.  Hello.  Hi, Marion.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  Great.  How was your limo ride?  We're having a ball here with Frenchy.  I'm ready to throw him out of a limousine and let him find his own way back.  We're in Trenton now, so he can hitchhike back.  He can hitchhike back.  Is this the first time you've ever been in a limo?  No, I've been in a limousine before.  Why?  When was the last time you were in a limo?  About five years ago.  Was that when you got married? 
[00:26:30]  No, I've been married now eight years.  Why?  What was your last limo trip?  What was it for?  I forgot.  You finally decided to go to the prom?  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah.  That was 1981 when I went to the prom.  You don't remember why you were in a limo five years ago?  I forgot.  I forgot why I was in a limo.  Why?  Was it a wedding?  I forgot.  How are you guys doing?  Hey, why are you guys going to come?  We met here.  Want to talk to Diana?  No.  Not at all.  Is she drunk?  No, no. 
[00:27:00]  She is drinking a bottle of Crystal Springs water.  She had two, no, she had three beers, and now she's drinking a bottle of water.  All right.  So we're having a lot of fun here with Frenchy.  I'm getting carsick just listening to them.  You're driving?  Actually, we're getting to know him a little better, and let me tell you one thing.  He is a funny person.  He's a cool guy.  All right.  Let me get to talk to him.  Shut up, you whore!  Listen to him.  He's a cool guy, though, because when we're talking, we're getting to know, you know.  Yeah, you're talking.  That's all you do. 
[00:27:30]  Well, what else are we going to do for two hours?  All right.  Come on.  Let's talk to Frenchy again.  Okay.  Hold on a minute.  Tell everybody to me and Diana to hello.  By the way, here's Frenchy.  Those two are getting $200 each.  Is that what they're getting?  Don't tell why.  Don't tell how much I'm making.  Yeah, I'm going to tell that stupid ass, too.  Frenchy.  Yeah.  All right.  Listen to that cackling in the background.  They won't shut up for a second.  Shut up on the phone! 
[00:28:00]  God damn it!  Shut you up!  You see?  See?  They cannot shut up.  Shut you up!  Shut up!  It's like Anthony Hopkins from that movie Magic.  Magic, when he's trying to keep the dummy quiet.  Yeah, well, that's not happening, my friend.  Unless they haven't seen them out.  That's the only thing that can shut them up.  Do you have a headache, Frenchy?  Yeah, I want to bang my head on the door right now.  Shut up!  I'm on the phone!  I got you!  Shut the ass up, you twat! 
[00:28:30]  It's not every day that Frenchy gets to, you know, enjoy a limo.  This is his hell today.  Holy Jesus Christ, man!  You were in a resting stop like about ten minutes ago.  I told the driver, let's go, let's leave them over there.  Just ditch them.  Yeah, ditch them.  They find their way around.  Anyway.  All the Frenchy haters are loving this today.  And they're talking.  And they're talking.  Listen, it's annoying the crap out of me.  Holy crap!  And they're talking.  And I'm talking to you guys.  Unbelievable.  You're on the phone and they're cacking. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And now they're like doing high five in the car now.  How retarded is that?  Hey, Frenchy.  Where's the gig tonight?  Where?  Yeah, do you know?  Shut up!  No, you guys, this is just a taste of what Frenchy has to deal with.  He's been dealing with this for the last hour and a half.  It's not fun.  It doesn't end when he hangs up the phone.  Holy shit.  This is his limo ride to Philly.  Do you know where you're going to be, Frenchy?  No, actually, I don't remember where I'm going. 
[00:29:30]  All right, hold on.  Ben, I forgot.  They're playing.  It's a place called Chemistry.  Chemistry, all right.  Octane, our friends Octane are playing.  Great, great cover band.  They play everything.  Did you hear what you said?  Oh, you're going to Philadelphia.  No crap, we're going to Philadelphia.  No, we're going on the moon and we leave you there, you whore.  They did not.  We're going to Venus and you stay there for the rest of your effing life.  They didn't know where they were going?  Who didn't know where they were going?  Stupid lady, stupid effing die. 
[00:30:00]  Lady effing die.  Shut up.  Lady died.  I'll punch you in the face.  Lady died just babbles because she doesn't know what to say ever.  She's retarded.  She just comes up with an inane babble.  And she's drunk and she babbles.  Yeah, and I hope she drinks a little more so she really makes a nap of that herself.  She already did, but that's okay.  All right.  I'm talking to you, you whore.  I'm talking to them.  Holy Jesus Christ, I'm on the phone. 
[00:30:30]  Shut up.  I'm having a phone conversation.  I'm not talking to you, you fuck bitch.  Shut up.  Holy Jesus Christ.  You're turning...  Frenchy, you're turning some people around today.  Some of those Frenchy haters are going to be on your side after today.  Yeah, I hope they will because I'm...  Holy crap.  Too bad I didn't take a gun with me.  I will shoot both of her knees.  I'm not talking to you.  And she talks to you.  We should have tied her up on the chair and put something in her mouth. 
[00:31:00]  I'm tied up before.  Shut up.  Shut the eff up.  I know there's frustration.  And not your retard is talking.  Shut the eff up, do you...  Shut up.  He can't take it.  Suck on a bar or something, you fuck bitch.  Suck on chicken.  Chicken face, you whore.  Shut up. 
[00:31:30]  I'm having enough.  I'm telling you right now.  I'm having enough.  And they're talking.  You're hearing this?  What?  Did you hear this?  Shut up, bar.  Holy Jesus Christ.  And now she's making the universal sign of shutting up.  Like, calm down.  I'm not calming down.  If I'm going to come and throw your face, you whore.  Shut up.  I'm not talking to you. 
[00:32:00]  Holy Jesus Christ.  Wow.  I have been in this situation.  And they're talking.  And they keep on talking.  And she doesn't shut up.  You can look her right in the face and go, shut the eff up, using the real eff word, and  just tell her.  Just shut up.  And she'll go, I was shutting up.  I don't understand why you're getting so angry.  I'm just trying to...  I'm talking a little bit, and it's not like...  No, don't say another word.  Not another peep.  I'm not even talking.  Why are you so angry?  I'm just...  Sure.  And you get to the point where the veins in your ears are ready to explode and blood 
[00:32:30]  will shoot out.  Oh, man.  I totally understand your pain when you come in the studio.  I totally understand it.  All right, Frenchy.  We're going to check in with you soon.  I want to talk to Lady Di real fast.  Okay.  Hold on one second.  All right.  Lady Di.  Do you want to speak to who?  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Okay.  Hold on.  You want to speak to me now, huh?  Lady Di.  Stupid twat.  God, I hate her.  Oh, is she the most annoying human being? 
[00:33:00]  Oh, my God.  I use that term loosely.  Pete's in the studio.  Hey, Pete.  Hi.  You like the new carpet?  I hope you guys like it.  You know something?  I walked in, and it gives the whole place a different look, doesn't it?  Okay, good.  It's nice.  Is it Scotch-Guarded?  It is.  It's Scotch-Guarded, so it can take an accidental spill.  Accidental, right.  Yeah, but you really...  Within reason, in other words.  Opie.  Oh.  Opie's now holding his coffee over the carpet, and it's tilted very... 
[00:33:30]  I heard that there was going to be a test case made against the person who spills the  first coffee.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Who installed the carpet?  He's outside.  What's his name again?  No, they just...  They had to leave, but the MTM...  It was Andy Law and Steve Gonzalez from MTM Construction.  They did a great job.  They did.  They did.  They're in Hackensack, New Jersey.  Right.  They worked all day to get the brand new carpet in today.  Maybe they can find a midday show for us here in New York.  Maybe.  It's possible. 
[00:34:00]  They seem to get the job done.  Did they do that thing where they kneel on one knee and take that gadget and hit it  with their knee?  These are individual tiles.  Oh, those are square tiles because the floor...  Really, Pete?  ...has little hatches on it so you can open up a, what, two foot by two foot?  Yeah, because we have...  And get into his...  Because there's wires under here, I'll be...  We have remnants of some of the old...  Some want to know if Pete used his chin dildo to help the...  To help lay the carpet?  Yeah, I don't think so.  The installation of the carpet, no?  All right, Pete. 
[00:34:30]  Well, Pete, thank you for looking after...  You're welcome.  There weren't any old classic jocks underneath the carpeting that have been lost?  Any...  Any bones?  Some old memos and stuff, but...  Weather, things like that.  Any...  No historical, any W memorabilia?  Some hysterical...  Yeah, okay.  Hey, hey, that's a Wunderbill joke.  Matt, what's up?  We've got to take a break real fast.  All right.  Listen, I could probably get my girlfriend and her girlfriend to come down to the studio  and baptize your new carpet.  Well, we're looking for the first couple to come down here to, you know, to break in 
[00:35:00]  the new carpet for us.  Yeah, I think the first stain on the carpeting here at this station should be from the Opie  and Anthony show and should be some type of love juices, right?  We'll do our best to get down there.  And I want to thank you guys, 15 years of sobriety out the window, listening to that  friggin' bit with the two whores and then the French guy.  Oh, do you just want to strangle those bitches?  Oh, my God.  Seriously, it was like I had my gun and I was just ready to eat a bullet.  I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  I'm telling you, my gut really hurts because I know the pain Frenchie's in. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, I absolutely know.  I was getting pissed off.  I was getting that feeling again just listening to her.  She is inept.  She has no clue what she's doing.  And you can look her right in the face and tell her to shut the F up, just like Frenchie  was, and she will keep talking.  All right, Matt, come on down here, all right?  All right, bro.  See you soon.  We'd love to see some carpet munching on the new carpet.  Oh, I like it.  I like it.  Oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah.  Okay, okay.  Start chewing the rug, boogie. 
[00:36:00]  Come on, someone help us out.  We need a couple to have sex on the new carpet to break it in.  And if you want in for Sex for Sam 3 tomorrow, you do that.  We'll let you in, okay?  Right.  Brett and Ann.  Brett and Ann.  Nice.  Brett, Ann.  What's up?  Where are you guys?  We're just in Manhattan now.  And you want to come down and christen the carpet?  Yeah, yeah, we have no problem doing that.  Do you want to be in Sex for Sam 3 tomorrow?  Yeah, yeah, we give that a try.  Well, get your asses down here. 
[00:36:30]  All right, where are you guys?  Hold on the line, okay?  Hold on.  We might have a couple to christen the new carpet.  That'd be good.  There should just be sex stains on the carpet in some capacity.  Without a doubt.  Yeah.  Tim.  Tim.  Opie.  What's up, Tim?  Hey, quick question.  Have you guys seen or heard from Stock or Fatty at all?  Oh, funny you ask.  We might use this as the radio tease this hour.  Funny you ask.  Anthony ran into Stock or Fatty last night.  Yeah.  We'll have an update next.  Bar nine.  All right, Tim. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, that was awful.  You can hook up Wheelchair Fred with her.  Thank you, Tim.  Yeah, that's not a bad idea.  All right, Brett.  All right.  Let him.  Someone suggesting, yeah, Sean from Manhattan suggesting Frenchie gets the midday show with  Lady Di and Marion.  That was just beyond hilarious because, you know, you can tell Frenchie can't take it.  No.  He cannot take it.  He's trapped.  He's trapped in there. 
[00:37:30]  And I think he's going to turn some people around with some of those Frenchie haters  are going to end up loving Frenchie after today.  Okay.  We should break.

You got to get the bait, put the hook in the water, and you never know. 
[00:47:30]  We got a bunch of things going on.  We got two couples on their way down to the studio to christen the new carpet.  Ha ha!  Two couples, huh?  Two couples now, yes.  How are we going to do this?  Is Pete going to...  We're going to make Pete watch.  Oh, it's going to be like that movie we were talking about a week ago with Gina Gershon.  Is that the movie?  And, and, uh...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a while ago.  The chilly girl there. 
[00:48:00]  With Baldwin, right?  Yeah.  And Kim Basinger.  And, and the guy's got to watch as his chick is getting banged.  We're going to make Pete watch his carpet getting violated.  Getting completely violated.  Yeah, or like hardcore.  He's worried about a little coffee being spilled on the new rug.  He hasn't seen anything yet.  Dude, he was freaking out at you tipping over your coffee cup.  If a drop would have come out and hit the carpet, he'd have freaked out.  Hell yeah.  And now he's going to have to watch as two couples just completely violate the carpet. 
[00:48:30]  Also...  Those are the worst kind of stains.  Ugh.  They stay with you for a while.  Turn it off.  Also...  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Also, we have sent Rich Voss,  who left for Philly last night, by the way.  Last night.  He got off easy.  They, uh, they put him up last night in Philly.  Yeah.  They're doing some kind of wow fan fest at, uh, Chemistry.  Octane's playing.  They're a great band.  I'm at this club called Chemistry. 
[00:49:00]  So Voss is going to be hosting it, I believe.  Yeah.  So they gave him the hotel room, and they wanted Frenchie.  So Frenchie's on his way down in a limo with the retarded Laverne and Shirley, Anthony.  Yeah.  They wanted...  Philly wanted Laverne and Shirley.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Uh, how's the technology working?  Are we going to be able to pull up audio from the stage?  We got the Zephyr hooked up.  When they hit, because I have got to hear the ovation that these two troggs are going to get when they walk out. 
[00:49:30]  What is a trogg?  A trogg.  You ever see the movie Trogg?  I know the band, the Troggs.  No.  They're troglodytes.  You ever see the movie Trogg?  I've never seen the movie Trogg.  It's just a big beast.  A big cave beast.  I love how you come up with these obscure movie titles, and you're surprised no one else has seen the movie.  Well, I haven't seen that one in many, many years.  Have you seen E.T.?  Yeah.  Of course.  Of course.  And you never saw Trogg?  No.  That was like those 70s movies that came out like The Frogs. 
[00:50:00]  Remember Frogs?  It was, I remember a bunch of frogs started attacking people.  I remember the movie about the killer ants.  Them.  That took their time going up each floor of the hotel or whatever.  Oh, that one?  Did you ever see Them?  Because of atomic testing in the desert, the ants got really big?  No, this was the small ants.  They were just multiplying.  Oh, no, no, I was talking about the giant ants, and they made this sound.  That's not believable. 
[00:50:30]  Before you knew it, you were in the giant mandibles of a huge ant.  Of a giant ant.  Yeah, there was a movie with killer rabbits.  Killer bunnies.  I've seen that one.  They were kind of big.  But you could tell the rabbits were in their cages.  Yeah, they were like...  In little fish tanks or something.  They were not even vicious.  They were bunnies.  They were little bunny rabbits like you see on the side of the road.  And then the bad acting where the guy puts his hand in front of his face and goes...  Yeah.  Oh!  And a giant bunny rabbit. 
[00:51:00]  I remember seeing that one.  Killed by cuteness.  And you could see the glare.  Yeah.  Yeah, the bunnies in their glass cages.  Yes.  Okay, Uncle John's on the phone.  So, anyway, they're playing chemistry tonight.  Octane and Rich Voss and Frenchie and the retarder of Vern Shirley.  And hopefully we'll get to listen in.  Oh, I hope so.  Hopefully.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, right after Frenchie talked to you, he calls me.  And he's like, John, come to Trenton.  I need to talk to somebody who actually listens to when I talk. 
[00:51:30]  Please come.  I can't take it.  He's like, I have an idea.  Bring a shovel.  We hit them on the head and we dig a hole and we throw them in the hole.  Please come.  Please come.  He was freaking, guys.  I swear to God, he's not kidding.  He wants you to go down there to bring him back later on tonight.  I'll tell you.  I think so.  Yeah.  And then he's like, I said, come Frenchie.  Just throw a glass out and tell him to go off themselves.  He says, Uncle John says, go off yourself.  They're saying, no, he didn't.  He's not screaming.  Go off yourself.  Go off yourself.  From me and John.  Both of us tell you, go off yourself.  He's freaking.  What you guys don't realize, nothing works with these two. 
[00:52:00]  No, there is nothing.  Only death.  Only killing them can stop them.  You could offer them $1,000 cash on the spot.  They cannot shut up.  Right.  They cannot shut up.  Especially when you're tanked.  Forget about it.  Yeah.  Frenchie wants to know if you can, and this is real.  Frenchie wants you to drive him home from this appearance because he cannot stay in the limo on the way back with these two.  Tell him to give Stinky the address.  I'll pick him up later.  All right.  Thank you, Uncle John.  All right, bud.  Bye.  Okay.  Let's go back to Frenchie in the limo. 
[00:52:30]  They're getting closer to their destination, Philly.  I want to die.  I want to die.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  He's doing French Richard Gere impressions.  I got nothing else.  I want to die.  Shut up, bud.  Holy Jesus, I've been crying. 
[00:53:00]  If there's a gun, he will take me out now.  You hear me?  He will take me out right now.  He's begging to God.  He's praying for death.  Frenchie.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Frenchie.  Frenchie.  Good news.  You're almost there.  Yeah.  You're almost there.  Please.  Please.  I hear you're in the Cherry Hill area.  You're almost there.  Frenchie.  Frenchie.  Thank God.  All right.  Frenchie.  I want to die.  Have they shut up at all?  No, they're not. 
[00:53:30]  They're not.  Like Uncle John said, he called me up.  I told him to shut the ass up.  They didn't want to shut the ass up.  They don't want to never shut the ass up.  I don't know how they sleep.  Yeah.  How do they sleep?  They probably...  Well, I can see it.  Yeah, I feel like going...  Jesus Christ.  I want to sleep.  Somebody put me out of my misery, man.  Reading I called me, I told him, you have a gun? 
[00:54:00]  He said, yeah, I have a gun.  I bring two bullets.  One for you and one for the driver.  I said, thanks a lot.  Yeah, is the driver pissed off?  The driver is driving.  He's been very quiet, but I'm sure he wants to shoot him too.  That's funny.  Holy cow.  Shut up!  How many beers have Lady Di not drinking?  Well, she's...  He always claims she doesn't drink.  Yeah.  Yeah, but she stopped drinking for some reason.  I don't know why.  We have a case of Budweiser there.  You work for them, you see?  So drink it, you whore. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, you know what they said to me?  Oh, please, take it down a notch.  I don't like when you call us a whore.  But you are!  Whore's back!  Take it down a notch.  Take it down a notch.  Taking their weight down a notch.  Or 200.  Yeah, and they talk to me, you slap in the face.  Well, I take my seat and I slap it over your face.  We're like...  Holy cow.  And they talk, and they keep on talking, and they're talking, and they're talking.  They're talking to my grave. 
[00:55:00]  Hey, Frenchie, what do they talk about?  They talk about crap.  They talk about the cars.  They talk about the sun.  They talk about the...  Whatever.  They're talking about everything, but they're pissing me off.  There's a phone that doesn't work in the limo.  I'm going to take him and use the handset to crack the head off.  I hear them just babbling about Philly in the background.  Holy Jesus Christ.  And they keep on talking, man.  All right.  And they're talking.  Listen to that.  Shut the F up! 
[00:55:30]  Please help me out.  Jesus.  I'm an asshole.  I got nowhere else to go.  You're almost there, Frenchie.  Hang in there.  I'm crying, man.  I'm going to cry in five minutes.  You should be at chemistry very soon.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know too, man.  I got to get out of here, man.  I got to get out of these men.  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  They never shut up!  Poor guy.  I'm feeling bad for him. 
[00:56:00]  I could listen to this all day.  You got it easy.  They in the studio.  You turn off to these thieves.  You take them out.  He takes them out.  Nobody can take them out of a goddamn car.  I have my seatbelt on, too.  Shut the ass up!  She has a seatbelt on so you don't roll around with a goddamn car, you fuck, bitch!  She can't always wear my seatbelt.  Thank God, because I'd be crushed by you fuck, buddy!  Do you see fucking tools? 
[00:56:30]  Holy Jesus!  Frenchy, that's not taking it down a notch.  Oh, my God.  Never!  They can suck it and dry.  Jesus Christ.  We're driving on the highway, and Mayan has to say, oh, we just passed the house.  Who gives the F?  Wait, what, what, what, what?  What was that, Frenchy?  We're driving on the highway.  Oh, we just passed where I live.  Who gives the F where you live?  And then we're passing, like, a refinery for gas in the house.  That's where you live!  Shut the F up! 
[00:57:00]  Oh, they're pointing out where they live?  Yeah, they said, oh, they talk about my son.  Who gives the F about your son?  He said, we thought just like you do.  That's not true.  Hey, hey, hey.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, you're not.  He's a tough fuck here.  Shut the fuck up!  I'm losing my goddamn mind.  That's what Ben, Ben just held up a note.  He can tell you're losing your mind, for real.  Yeah, I'm going to curse very soon.  Listen to that now.  They're looking at you.  You're missing something.  You're missing my feet up you A, you whore. 
[00:57:30]  You're missing my foot up your ass.  Holy Jesus Christ.  Please, somebody take me out of my misery.  Is there any cops listening that can pull us off?  And actually, I can ride with a cop.  You think?  Maybe you should open the sunroof and just start screaming for help.  If you open the sunroof, she sticks her head out.  We go over an overpass and they chop her head off.  I mean, no matter what, that way.  Holy Jesus Christ.  Shut the F up!  It's enough.  Enough.  You want to talk to Marion real fast? 
[00:58:00]  And she keeps talking.  Let's talk to Marion.  She's talking.  And they keep on talking.  Holy Jesus.  Are we over a train station?  I guess she's done that right over.  Have a goddamn train run them over.  And we develop a goddamn train too, you stupid fucks, boys.  All right.  Enough.  You want to speak to Marion for a second?  Yeah, for a second.  Now, hold on.  Hi.  Marion, why won't you shut up?  No, me and Diana are talking.  Oh.  We're talking about the scenery. 
[00:58:30]  That's all you ever do.  What are you talking about?  There is no scenery to Philly.  Yes, there is.  Water, the trees.  Philly's a great city, but the ride from New York to Philly is not that scenic.  There's nothing to talk that much about.  It's scenic.  You two are just babbling.  No, we're not.  We're talking.  What else are we going to do for two and a half hours?  Just sit quiet and look out the goddamn window and shut up.  Just look out the window.  I don't play Philly Winks no more.  Oh.  What? 
[00:59:00]  I don't play Philly Winks.  So what are we going to do?  We're going to talk.  Frenchie's talking on us.  I found out about where he lives.  I found out that he's married.  I found out a lot of things about the guy.  I found out where he works.  We're going to go bother him at his work.  Oh.  Great.  Get Frenchie back on the phone.  Hold on.  Hey, you know what?  We miss you guys, okay?  Shut up.  You just saw us.  Thank you.  We love you.  Bye.  You just saw us.  How lame is that, huh? 
[00:59:30]  Frenchie, you didn't actually give them the restaurant that you work at, did you?  No, of course not.  What?  Are you kidding me?  I'm going to have two retards in my restaurant?  I'd rather die, my friend.  I'd take the cleaver.  I'd chop them right on the phone of the goddamn restaurant.  And I'd make a goddamn special that night.  Yeah.  I'm sure it would go.  Jesus.  And they're talking.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I'm going to take my phone and I'm going to throw it out their face.  All right, Frenchie.  Hang in there.  Yeah.  Please, come on and check me out right now.  All right.  Good job, Frenchie.  We'll talk to you soon, okay?  All right.  Take it easy, guys. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, that poor son of a bitch.  Sheep lover saying, I bet Frenchie wishes he was deported.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Oh, hey, Norton.  There's nothing funny in the world that a Frenchman in a limo with two retards.  It is.  I can listen to this all afternoon.  Oh, I know.  Goodbye.  Bye.  All right, bye.  Hef is, he's got a good observation.  Hef, what's up?  Hey, is it just me or does Frenchie sound like a psychotic Jackie Chan? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Hey, that's pretty funny.  All right, I'm going to listen to myself then.  All right, bye.  All right.  Yeah, people were saying that.  They were also saying he sounded like Arnold.  Arnold, where's Arnold yelling, shut up?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  Didn't it?  Let me hear.  How can you find sound effects anymore?  Oh, I know.  I got, I got.  You got like hundreds to choose from over there.  I suck it.  See, you don't got the right one. 
[01:01:00]  That scared me.  You got it.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Quiet.  Well, maybe not.  Come on.  Come on.  Do it.  Do it.  Come on.  Come on.  Kill me.  I'm here.  Kill me.  I'm here.  Kill me.  Come on.  Kill me.  I'm here.  Yeah, a little bit.  Come on.  Do it now.  Kill me.  That's pretty close.  It's a trip. 
[01:01:30]  Okay, Anthony, we forgot to tell everyone.  Barry Williams is stopping by.  Oh, right.  Our good friend.  Greg Brady.  We're going to turn him on to a very cool website, by the way.  Also, we want to talk about credit card horror stories, scam stories.  Because our own John.  John, who makes about $3.50 an hour working for this show.  Yeah.  I still call him Intern John.  Yeah, he's pretty much an horrified intern.  He hasn't been an intern here in a while, but I still think of him as one of the interns.  We're giving him bus fare. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, it's pretty much just bus fare.  He had a little problem with his ATM card.  A little?  There's somebody using his ATM card in the Dominican Republic.  Withdrawing money.  Withdrawing the John Fortune out of his fleet account.  As he sleeps.  As he sleeps.  As he sleeps, the fortune is dwindling.  Yes.  A huge, massive cash.  And also on the way, a stupid little stock story.  Yeah.  Brings back memories of the old boss. 
[01:02:30]  B-b-b-b-b-boys.  Brucie, Brucie.  Who promised us we'd get rich by the stock market, boys.  Another example of what a cheap Jew he was.  Well, come on.  Are you lying?  Look, it could be a cheap guinea or a cheap chink or something.  He just happened to be a Jewish guy, and he's very cheap.  Boys, you don't need paper money.  The stock market is the way to go.  Boys, I'll tell you how to be smart in business.  It's not about taking a big paycheck. 
[01:03:00]  It's all about stock options.  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.  He had a great idea how he was going to give Anthony and I a great big raise.  Now, the pay doesn't look like that much.  But when you figure in this great stock that we're giving you, boys, you just take it and put it away.  And in a couple of years, it'll amass a fortune.  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.  We had to work there for five years to get all of our shares.  Yeah.  We'll get into the whole thing.  It sounded like a scam. 
[01:03:30]  And I want to let everyone know what the stock is worth today.  Yeah.  Okay.  Whore.  This Thursday.  Filthy whore.  Sex for Sam.  Three.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This Thursday night, right after Opie and Anthony, YSP has got 94 tickets in 94 minutes  for Sammy Hagar and David Lee Roth this Saturday at the Tweeter Center.  Tickets are still available for this show at 215-336-2000 from 94-WYSP.  All right, Nigel, you called the meeting. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, what's up, Nigel?  Lads, I'm leaving the band.  You what?  You must be joking.  No joke, just time for a change.  We made $87 million last year.  I know, but I'm going back to college.  College?  She's putting us on.  You wanker.  No, I've got an idea for an animated film with these little characters with dust mops for  heads and they fly around the world on tiny white soda crackers.  Cool.  Don't encourage you.  So I'm going to study digital animation at Expression Center for New Media.  Bloody hell.  There goes four years. 
[01:04:30]  No, I get my bachelor's degree in less than a year and a half.  You're joking.  And they teach sound recording and graphic design there as well, in case I change my mind  about the whole dust mop thing.  Hey, Nigel.  Yeah.  Well, they teach you how to play guitar there too.  Expression Center for New Media is in the heart of the San Francisco Bay Area.  For more info, click on expression.edu or call toll free 877-833-8800.  That's 877-833-8800.

The fine people at Amstel Light can't stress enough that with so many water activities in a person's summer,  swimming, water skiing, watering the lawn, washing the car, staring at your neighbor in the shower,  the drinking a watered-down light beer shouldn't be added to the list. 
[01:09:00]  Hey, I'm all for watching the kids run on the slippery sliding tarp as much as the next guy.  I just don't want to drink the water on the tarp when they're done.  Thankfully, there's Amstel Light.  Amstel Light is a light beer that actually tastes like beer and serves as a perfect complimentary drink  after your aquatic activities have been completed.  And nobody will confuse drinking Amstel Light with a water activity,  something other light beers can't claim.  With the heat and the fun of the great outdoors this summer, 
[01:09:30]  it's more than okay to cover yourself with some cold, refreshing H2O.  Just make sure when you're done, you cover your taste buds with something a little more rewarding,  like Amstel Light.  Always satisfying, never watered-down, Amstel Light.  The beer drinkers like beer.  Imported by Amstel USA, White Plains, New York.  Getting all slap-happy, it's Adam and Dave from Tweeter.  By slap, we mean sounds, looks, and performance tour.

Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How about that, huh?  On YSP. 
[01:13:00]  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Let's not forget.  Okay, big ups to Harlem Little League, Opie.  Going to the Little League World Series.  Yo, kids!  Yeah!  I want to give a shootout to the Harlem Little League. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, there they go.  There's got to be some great tactics that they play with.  Did you hear some of the interviews?  It's called being black.  I was in sports my whole life.  Every time we had to play a black team, we folded as the white boys.  We were always scared of the black athletes.  On Long Island.  They're, uh...  Well, they bussed us in to play Malvern High School.  Oh. 
[01:14:00]  Amityville High School.  Amityville.  Wine Danch.  I was, uh, I was into the hoops for a while there, Anthony.  Yeah.  And, uh, we were scared S-less.  We forgot how to play basketball.  We didn't know how to pass anymore or shoot.  And we would just get creamed.  Of course.  They had, uh, armed guards behind the benches where we sat.  Uh, back then there was curfews in the town.  Really?  We had to be escorted from the bus to the locker room.  By the time the game started, we were, we were so scared.  We just wanted to go home. 
[01:14:30]  Did you have big wet stains in your, uh, shorts?  In your, in your basketball shorts?  Might as well have.  Just scared.  Petrified.  I don't know what's going on in Amityville, but man, they, those boys reached puberty  way before I did.  Well, they were probably all about 24 years old.  You know, that's, that's the easy joke.  But something's going on because they looked a lot older than we did.  Did they?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  But anyway, Harlem.  Harlem.  Yeah.  Little League.  Uh, I guess they, they, uh, they're going on to the Little League World Series. 
[01:15:00]  Remember the controversy?  What was that?  Last year?  Or do all these kids check out?  Are they all the proper age?  What was that little kid?  Amante.  And he was, he was 38 years old on the Little League team.  And he was pitching.  No, these, you see, I was listening to some of the interviews with the parents though.  Or the, uh, parent of, uh, some of these kids from the Harlem Little League.  I couldn't understand what they were saying.  We're winning this all time.  Let me tell you this all.  We're going down there.  We're going to take the whole thing. 
[01:15:30]  We got audio of that?  We ought to pull some.  Oh, we got some audio.  See if you can get some from Wins upstairs.  10-10 Wins.  They got audio of some of the kids and the parents.  Very excited that the, uh, Harlem Little League team is moving on to the World Series.  Mikey, what's up?  Didn't you call your black friend a nigger when you were playing basketball with him?  Yeah.  Well, you just said you were scared of the black folk.  Well, that was him trying to be friendly and fit in with his basketball.  And we had the fake black kids in my high school.  Fake black?  We had the black girls in my high school. 
[01:16:00]  They weren't the real ghetto black kids at Harborfields.  Yeah, Harborfields back then had the fake black kids.  So your black friend was a fake black friend?  Yeah, I think so.  But weren't you playing with real black people in front of him?  Uh, he was.  When you called him a nigger?  He was light-skinned.  Oh, I see.  So he was a white nigger.  All right.  But it was.  I'm out.  All right.  All right.  All right.  But it was one of those, uh, things where you're like, you know, how the brothers will  call each other, yo, my nigger.  Right.  Without the R.  I thought I.  And you thought you fit in enough to be able to use that terminology. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, we've told this story a million times.  I just thought I was being accepted by, uh, my, my black friends.  I see them doing the, the N word left and right as they're playing hoops.  Like, nice shot, my.  And there you are.  Yeah.  So I turned to my friend Gary after he hit a three-pointer.  I said, nice shot.  Yeah.  And.  And actually, I never officially called him the word because halfway through saying the  word, I was knocked out cold. 
[01:17:00]  And that, my friends, is a true story.  I learned a valuable lesson.  Of course.  At the early age of 16.  You, uh, you should have known.  Did you get all nervous thinking about saying it?  I would go to basketball camps with these guys.  I'd go to their homes.  I'd go to their hoods.  I, I, uh, I, what?  Their hoods.  Their hoods.  They had hoods.  Yo, my nigger.  Yeah, that's exactly what happened.  I was listening. 
[01:17:30]  Nice shot, Nick.  I was listening to some of their music.  I thought I was in.  Yeah.  I wasn't in.  No.  Even white folks, the pimp, knows not to use that word.  And he's totally in with them.  I thought I was in.  But, I mean, when we, uh, played Malvern in Amityville, it, it took the whole black thing  to a whole nother level.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I had the, uh, I, I went to John Glenn High School.  And, uh, we didn't have many black guys in, in our school either. 
[01:18:00]  I think it was such a segregated school.  In the cafeteria, there was, uh, one small corner of a table that I think every black kid  in the school sat in.  And they'd just sit down, uh, uh, and keep to themselves.  It's kind of weird now that you think about it, you know?  And I wasn't into sports.  So, uh, I really never had any contact with my black brothers in, uh, in high school.  Hung out with the stoners.  Like, you were in sports, so you're going to Amityville and they're busting you off to  other things.  I was just like, hmm, hang out with my five stoned friends. 
[01:18:30]  And that was it.  I really didn't get the, uh, culture.  You didn't do the sports?  Never.  I was never into anything that would have kept me in school any longer than I had to  be.  Like, as I'm leaving.  You had the weirdest childhood, man.  We just touched the surface yesterday with that kid thing.  By the way, Anthony said all that stuff yesterday.  Right.  Anthony did.  Not Ope.  I'll get hammered for it, I know.  Ope loves the kids.  Right.  Anthony hates the kids. 
[01:19:00]  Don't get me wrong.  No, I love children.  We're in this together, but Anthony went on the rant yesterday.  Not me.  I love children.  I just can't understand having them, and I don't want to deal with other people's children's  problems.  That's all I was saying yesterday.  All right.  Let's go to Garage Larry, or Larry.  What's your stupid name, Larry?  It's Larry.  I'm a stoner on the, uh, stoner is Stonby.  Oh, Garage Larry.  Oh, yeah.  Garage.  Oh, Larry from the garage in the, in the woods of, uh, PA there.  Yeah, he did.  How you guys doing?  All right.  Great.  And what's the name of your gun?  Uh, Betsy. 
[01:19:30]  That's right.  Betsy.  Yeah, how you guys doing?  The sawed-off, uh, shotgun that he, yeah, yeah.  That he threatens to fire every time he's on the air with us.  Yeah.  What's going on, Larry?  Uh, it was on ESPN, the O&A, all day today, uh, about that Harlem team.  Yeah.  They violated the rules as far as residency goes.  As far as what goes?  The residents.  So the kids where they live.  Yeah?  Yeah, they violated the rules.  As far as.  It's been on ESPN all day.  Let me see.  Little League officials are investigating whether the Harlem, New York team has advanced, uh, 
[01:20:00]  this year's work.  Yeah.  Have violated residency rules.  Yep.  Newsday reported Wednesday as many as three players, including star pitcher.  Right.  Allabay Barkley live outside the boundaries of the Harlem Little League district.  Right.  Uh-oh.  Mm-hmm.  They're, they're bringing in some ringers.  Uh.  That's what they're doing.  Yeah.  Last summer's Little League, uh, World Series dogged by a scandal in the Bronx when Danny  Amante was discovered to be 14 years old instead of 12.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And, uh, they received two anonymous messages accusing the Harlem team of using players who 
[01:20:30]  were too old or lived out of the league's boundaries.  Do you see that one kid on when I, how big he was?  Uh, no.  I'm not paying attention to the Little League thing.  Oh, no.  Well, I do because I took a team there in 82.  You did?  Yeah.  I mean, we made it to Williamsport, yeah.  Hey, congrats.  But, uh, yeah, isn't that something?  All right, Larry.  Thank you for that.  Hey, no problem.  Hey, you guys keep it up.  All right.  Where's Jim at?  He's around somewhere.  Tell him why I called and said hello.  Okay.  I mean that.  Jim's got the easiest job in America. 
[01:21:00]  He doesn't, like, and I have to be here.  Right.  Jim just shows up when he feels like it.  Yeah.  And we're okay with that.  That's fine.  Let's go to John.  Hey, John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I was just remembering, uh, back when I was in high school playing freshman ball.  Yeah.  Um, we went and played, uh, Dickinson High School in Jersey City.  Okay.  And as a freshman, you can imagine going to this place and seeing these guys that are dunking on us.  Yeah.  I mean, all these black kids. 
[01:21:30]  Dunk on you in a high school ball?  That happened to us, too.  Yes.  Like, you've got to be kidding me.  You're doing the white man layups?  Dude, I...  It's sick, because in the beginning, like, you know, before the game, you know,  game starts, how you take your practice shots?  Yeah.  These guys coming out, dunking and doing alley-oops, and we're just taking these cheap little shots.  Yeah.  You look like one of those highlight reels from the 50s college basketball, where they  just do the layups, and they're all white.  We were doing the two-hand set shot, and they're dunking.  And they're just running in midair, doing that slam. 
[01:22:00]  We're doing it from the hoop.  The underarm, the, what, the underhand foul shots there?  No, the Rick Barry shot.  Yeah, there you go.  All right, guys.  Take care, man.  John reminded me of something else, Anthony.  The Richie Cunningham shot.  Yeah.  I remember that episode.  I once had a guard, a guard.  Yeah.  Who was as black as Mickey Rivers.  Yeah.  I'm just telling you the truth here.  Mm-hmm.  This is a little taste of reality.  I was so scared, the guy scored probably 35 points on me, because I didn't want to piss  him off.  You were intimidated. 
[01:22:30]  I was so effing intimidated.  Yeah.  This guy was blacker than night.  I was out of my skin, scared.  I just never got into it.  When I used to leave school, I was saying this before, when I used to leave school, if  I even stayed the whole day, when I would leave school, I would see you guys in the gym  or outside practicing for football or whatever.  And I would be, I could not fathom, I'd be like, why are they staying later than the  school day? 
[01:23:00]  As I'm walking home, I'd be like, I'd look back and go, who the hell does this?  Because it's a chance of socializing stuff, too.  No, I was going home to socialize.  Yeah.  You were the latch key.  Yeah.  I had two parents that beat the crap out of me if I was a minute late with curfew and  stuff.  This was a chance to get away with some stuff, staying after school.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I was just wondering, because I always wonder, making out behind the gym there, doing a little  of this, a little of that, you know, drinking a little bit.  There was all sorts of other things going on.  There's a way to socialize if you came from a pretty strict family. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  Because I would look, I would turn around every day and go, I cannot grasp this.  I cannot figure out why you would want to stay a minute later than that last bell ring.  We had cheerleaders.  They went on the bus with us.  School was so creepy to me after hours.  It was creepy.  I didn't like it.  It, like, freaked me out a little bit.  The empty halls and that kind of thing.  Did you ever visit your high school in the middle of summer?  Oh, yeah.  That is a weird feeling.  It's weird.  It's all weird. 
[01:24:00]  There's no one in there.  And it's creepy.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, Opie.  Hey, Opie.  Opie, you brought up a story.  You brought up some memories from me.  I was cracking up listening to you.  I played football in the late 70s on Long Island.  And we used to go out to Brentwood.  Oh, my God.  And I want to tell you something.  We played Brentwood in basketball.  Let me tell you something.  We had 20 guys on my football team.  I mean, they almost dropped the team.  We were literally picking up guys in the hallway. 
[01:24:30]  And they had told us, like, the whole week before that game, listen, there was a big  problem here a few years ago.  And, you know, there was, like, a rumble or a riot in the stands.  Somebody got knifed.  They literally drove the bus on the service road up to the field.  They wouldn't let us get off the bus until the kickoff.  I looked at the players on my team.  It was so intimidating.  This guy's not lying.  We used to have to stay on the bus, too, until close to game time. 
[01:25:00]  And then we got rocked on the way out.  I don't think we ever played.  And then school went on austerity.  They quit the football team.  Wow.  Brentwood.  Brutal.  All right.  Cool.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Brentwood is, like, a really, really brutal area.  Kevin, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I graduated from New Rochelle High School.  And mostly Jewish kids on the basketball team and whatnot.  And Mount Vernon was in our conference.  So we played them twice every year.  And when Ben Gordon was there just a couple years ago, absolutely horrified them. 
[01:25:30]  Just made them look stupid, dunking and dragging shots from any which corner you shoot it from.  That's got to be hysterical to see.  It is pretty funny.  It really has to be hysterical to watch these poor little Jewish white kids getting just dunked on and shot on at will.  I just remember the memories of being on that Amityville basketball court.  And you could just see it in your teammates' eyes.  We were all scared.  S-list.  And even the black guys on our team, and I think we had two. 
[01:26:00]  Right.  I think we had two.  They were even scared because they knew that they were fronting the whole time and they weren't real black guys.  Right, right.  You have your black guys on your team, which are, like, 6'2".  And then, you know, they have their 7-foot guy on their team.  7-foot high school kid.  He's not kidding, Anna.  He's not kidding.  How were the stands at Amityville?  Like, what were the bleachers like?  Were they just full of black people?  Oh, yeah.  That were intimidating you?  No, they took their basketball real seriously.  By stomping. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, stomping on the bleachers.  Oh, yeah.  And then the cheerleaders were doing their black cheers.  That alone would scare you.  It has already been barong.  Right.  Yeah.  What is that?  It was, like, so foreign to us.  All right, Kevin.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Bye.  Yeah, they're just leaps and bounds more mature than you guys.  Bringing their kids to the game.  Like, you must teach in high school.  You think I'm kidding?  Who has kids in high school? 
[01:27:00]  Bringing their kids to the game.  If you had a kid in my high school, you know what?  We didn't see you again.  Yeah.  But in some of these schools, they bring the kid right to school.  They send them away to the convent to have the kid give it away and come back and say  they were on vacation.  They went to visit a sick aunt.  Carl, what's up?  Yo, ONA.  Hey.  Yeah, you guys talking about playing to black schools, you brought back some memories.  Yeah.  I played football for a school outside Philadelphia.  And I played for three years.  In our three years, we won four games. 
[01:27:30]  So I told you, we weren't very good.  But my senior year, Coach, the side for our homecoming game, you know, let's play Trenton  High.  Yeah, Coach, that's a real good one.  And I played defensive end.  And I went against this nigger that was about nine.  No, no, no, no.  That's not where...  That's not where...  I'm sorry.  I want to get this black guy that was 6'5", and he had to have been 25 years old.  He had a full beard and everything.  The guy ruined it.  Yeah, come on, Carl.  He ruined his story.  That's not what I'm getting at here.  Come on. 
[01:28:00]  All right.  Thank you, Carl.  All right.  Peace out.  They might have had a good story, and he's got to ruin it.  Okay.  Do we have time for the stock thing?  I think it's fast, because we've got Barry Williams outside the studio.  Oh, he's waiting outside?  And we want to turn him on to a new website we found today, okay?  Yeah.  A lot of people are going to like this new website.  And a Stalker Patty update.  Yeah.  And a Frenchie update.  I think Frenchie has made it to Philly.  Thank God for him.  He's at Chemistry.  The Fan Fest, the WOW Fan Fest in Philly is going to start in about an hour. 
[01:28:30]  And hopefully we'll be able to listen in on what's going on down there, okay?  I hope so.  But, Anthony, I was checking my stocks today.  Yeah.  Ha ha!  The once mighty portfolio.  Seemed like a good idea three years ago,  when I had a little extra spending money.  Yeah.  And I checked one of our stocks that you and I got many years ago in Boston.  It was really our first foray into the stock field, into the stock market. 
[01:29:00]  Another great story from the WAAF days.  With Bruce Mittman, who was our GM.  Boys, boys.  Nah.  It was no secret that Ant and I were, we were killing.  Yeah.  In Boston, as far as radio goes.  But we weren't making any money.  No.  We were making nothing.  To the point where other DJs would get on the air and joke about how little we were making.  Yeah.  And we had no defense because they were right.  They were absolutely right. 
[01:29:30]  Anthony.  If you're holding, if you're holding a job out there that you've had for about, I don't  know, a year, two years, you were probably making more money than I was.  I know that.  You were living in the projects.  Yeah.  I was living in the projects.  I was living in an apartment complex where I swear to you, I swear to you, there were chickens  running around.  There were Hispanic people living in this project.  It was in Ashland, Mass.  But it was this corner of Ashland where I guess some of the Framingham Hispanic people 
[01:30:00]  lived.  And it was in this apartment complex and it was chickens.  Chickens.  A guy fenced off an area by his patio, they'd give you this cement patio.  You know how that usually, you live in an apartment, you have the sliding glass door,  and you have probably a six foot by five foot cement patio right out the sliding glass door.  That's yours, right?  That's yours.  That's your little area.  You put your little barbecue maybe.  Patio furniture.  Right, right, right.  You put a couple of chairs.  It's very small.  Yeah.  He fenced off an area that was probably a quarter acre with like chicken wire and let loose chickens 
[01:30:30]  and pigs in his self-made yard.  He had a kiddie waiting pool with about five to eight children in their dirty diapers running  around and going in this little waiting pool, a big beach umbrella.  You're forgetting something.  It wasn't a waning pool.  It was a pothole.  Oh, yeah.  Remember when it rained?  When it rained.  This is no radio joke.  When it rained, we had potholes in the parking lot. 
[01:31:00]  They were so big, the kids would play in them.  The kids would play in them.  They would be in their underwear or their diapers and they would be swimming in the potholes.  We were on the radio at WAF.  Everyone thought we were rock stars.  I got pulled over once in my car.  Remember my Dodge Ares K?  My blue 86 Dodge Ares K car?  That, yes.  I remember seeing it on blocks in your yard when we decided to move to Boston and you  said that the car was going to work fine for you. 
[01:31:30]  I'm driving through Ashland.  That same car we're still looking for because you did abandon it somewhere.  I abandoned it in Maranek, New York.  So I'm driving around in Ashland and all of a sudden I hear behind me, I'm like, uh-oh,  uh-oh, well, I'm getting pulled over.  So we had done appearances by this time, so people knew what we looked like locally.  So this concert wasn't from Real Rock TV?  Maybe that was it.  Maybe that was it, the exposure.  On the Spanish-speaking station? 
[01:32:00]  On the Spanish channel.  Our great appearances on Real Rock TV.  They're legendary.  They're as legendary as the XFL thing.  Yeah.  I'm going to bring some of those tapes in for Steve.  Real Rock TV?  Oh, yeah.  You got them?  Oh, I have all of them.  Right.  You must have been huge in his apartment complex.  Huh?  On the Spanish channel, you must have been huge celebrity in his apartment complex.  Oh, I know, right?  No, that was when the Spanish people turned off the TV was when that show came on.  Because it was English.  They didn't understand it.  So you're getting pulled over.  I get pulled over.  The cop comes up and I'm like ready to get my license and stuff. 
[01:32:30]  He goes, Anthony.  He's like, yeah, all right, cool.  He recognized me.  He goes, what are you doing driving this piece of crap?  Like, that's when I realized it's like, oh, my God, I'm getting some fame, but I'm poor.  Which is probably the worst type of fame you could have.  If you're fame, you're getting some fame, but you don't have the money to back it up.  You know what?  When you get a little fame, people expect things from you.  They expect you to, you know, buy a round of drinks, pick up dinner.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Not drive a Dodge Aries K car. 
[01:33:00]  I mean, the restaurant's up there and people are expecting stuff like that.  I don't have a nickel to my, I don't even have a bank account.  Yeah.  I did not have a bank account until five years ago.  I used to go to Green Acres, that bar around the corner.  And, you know, I'm the guy on the radio.  People know that.  And I'm paying for my beers with quarters.  I had quarters.  I had the big, I walk in and you just hear the jingle jingle and I got the big fat pockets  because I expect to do some drinking.  And I'm pulling out quarters.  One, two, three, one. 
[01:33:30]  One, two, three, two.  One, two, three, three dollars.  There you go.  But that bar had the great Aussie tribute band.  Jesus, that place.  What a crap hole.  So, that was my local bar, though.  So, back then when a listener wanted to buy us a beer, hey, buy all you want, man.  Yeah.  Because we can't.  Now I'm like, I grab the beer and go, you spitting this.  Yeah, right.  You know, but back then, oh my God, anything.  We weren't making anything.  So, we finally got the balls to go to b-b-b-boys. 
[01:34:00]  Boys.  Boys.  I think our contract was coming up or something.  Yeah.  And we were ready to turn the screws to the bosses, weren't we, Opie?  Oh, yeah.  Me and Opie, no representation.  We don't need an agent.  We're good enough.  We don't need an agent to go make these deals.  Why pay him 10% when we can go in and do it ourselves?  I don't think they'll notice that we're scared S-less.  Yeah.  And they will be able to take advantage of us.  That we have no clue how much we deserve to make or should make or what the competition  makes or anything.  I was the a-hole back then.  I'm like, I can handle them. 
[01:34:30]  I was just happy to be there.  I'll play agent.  They took us for a beating.  So we go to a restaurant with Dave Dickface and Brucie.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The paper slide.  No, no, no.  The paper slide, Dave was not there.  That was Bruce taking us to the Chinese buffet place in Worcester for our Christmas bonus  and yelled and screamed in front of everybody how awful we were after giving him a year  of great ratings. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, because I remember being at some bar where there was a cowboy motif and we were sitting  at a small table and it was too small for four people.  That was Dave Perlman and Bruce.  No, Dickless was there at one of these things.  No, he wasn't because you know what?  Here's something that Dave's going to find out today.  They didn't give him the same stock stuff that they gave you and I.  Remember Bruce said, boys, don't tell me.  The only people getting stock options are myself and you two.  Don't tell Dave.  I swear to God, he was not part of this. 
[01:35:30]  I could swear Dickless was there, but not for the stock thing, for the money slide.  No.  No?  No, Bruce took us to lunch.  Dude, you're talking to the rain man of our radio careers.  Somehow I just have him weaseling his way in everywhere.  No, no, no, because we wouldn't have it.  We never did business with him.  Yeah.  So we're at the Chinese buffet.  Right.  And it was we heard rumors about we're going to get a bonus, a Christmas bonus. 
[01:36:00]  A Christmas bonus.  Because we'd made the station an S load of money.  Like, hey, you know, we're not making much money.  But you know what?  Usually they pay radio stars a nice end of year Christmas bonus.  Here it comes.  Here comes the Christmas bonus.  I remember being all excited going, well, oh, he invited us to lunch.  This must be where he gives us the bonus, don't we?  Oh, yeah.  Remember?  Oh, great.  I remember you and I talking like, okay.  Very excited.  At least he's going to make good now.  You know?  Paid his crap all year, but here comes the big bonus.  We'll be able to.  Here comes the bonus.  We'll be able to, you know, buy some nice gifts.  I can move into an upper floor apartment at my slum. 
[01:36:30]  Right.  Get the high ground where I can look and keep an eye on them.  So we get to this Chinese buffet.  All you can eat buffet for $6.95.  He would take us there all the time.  Boys, I'm buying today $6.95 all you can eat.  Pack up.  Pack up.  I'll take some home with me.  The cheapest individual.  Bruce Mittman.  Cheapo.  El Cheapo.  I would start looking at the menu.  No, no, no.  They have a great buffet here, boys.  Boys.  Because you'd have to pay for the individual.  Freaking dishes if you went from the menu. 
[01:37:00]  Bruce, he still has his bar mitzvah money.  He still has it.  He hasn't spent it.  Cheapo.  He spent it on the largest SUV I've ever seen in my life.  Boys, I get an Escalade.  I need an Escalade to make up for my small stature.  He had a rope ladder to get into the thing.  It came with an elevator as an option.  And a booster seat for me.  Booster seat.  No, my kids are in college, boys.  The booster seat's for me.  I tied blocks to my shoes like Little Short Round from the Indiana Jones movie. 
[01:37:30]  Right.  So we're enjoying our Chinese buffet.  Yeah.  And then he proceeds to yell at us in front of everybody.  Yeah.  How the station's going to lose its license and this and that.  We had done something.  I forgot.  Yeah, but he was just bitching at us.  The police hate me.  And I'm looking at Opie.  My neighbors hate me because of the stuff you're doing on your show.  You know, I can't even go to a PTA meeting anymore without having to catch flack from your show. 
[01:38:00]  He lived in Snootin.  I look at Opie.  He cared about what his neighbors said.  I'm thinking, where's the bonus, Opie?  Yeah.  When does the bonus?  Is it after the yelling we get the bonus?  Look at poor Barry.  He's giving us the wrap it up.  Oh, my God.  What's the matter, Barry?  Don't talk to Barry.  Take care of Barry.  Sorry we don't have cool sitcom stories to tell about making out with the mother and stuff. 
[01:38:30]  Hold on, Barry.  Hold on.  So, yeah, and this was also to talk about our next deal.  Right.  So he writes down our raises on a tiny piece of paper and pushes it forward.  Pushes it.  You ever see in the movies?  This is after he yelled at us.  Yeah.  You ever see in a movie when they're making a huge deal and there's people on opposite sides of a table and a figure, a figure is written on a piece of paper and turned upside down and then slid slowly across the table to the other party where they pick it up, look at it and go, I think we have a deal. 
[01:39:00]  And then they leave the table.  Yeah.  He was doing that move.  Now, first he yells at us to soften up the beaches that we don't figure we're worthy or worth anything.  Make us feel like crap.  Make us feel like crap and make us feel worthless.  Typical management stuff, by the way.  He's really busting apart those stereotypes, Brucey.  You really bust those apart.  And then he slides this piece of paper.  I pick it up and start laughing out loud. 
[01:39:30]  I could not contain myself.  I was laughing out loud.  He was so insulted and mortified at the same time.  He was completely insulted.  Right.  And I didn't know what to do.  I just started laughing.  You were breaking down crying.  I was, yeah.  It just came out as a laugh.  Because you build it up in your head.  You go, well, what's the offer going to be?  I bet it's got to be good.  We're doing really well.  It's got to be.  And he slides the paper right up until he stopped the slide up.  It was a $2,000 a year raise, by the way.  Yeah.  I was like, sounds good, right? 
[01:40:00]  Not really.  Not when I started out at $26,000.  There you go.  I was like, oh, that brings me up to $28,000.  That's great.  $28,000.  And I'm a radio star in Boston.  I'm almost up to the money I was making knocking 10 when I left New York.  Almost.  I think I was $500 short of that after this big slide raise.  Yeah.  So we pretty much said, well, that's not going to do.  No.  So then he gets this great idea for the stock option thing.  Boys. 
[01:40:30]  Boys, cash is one thing.  Let me enlighten you in the ways of the market.  The stock market.  See, if you have cash, boys, you're going to spend it.  But if I give you options, what you do is you take the stock certificate and put it away.  That's right.  Forget about it.  That's what he said.  Just put it away and forget about it.  In years to come, you will look at this and go, oh, my God, it's worth so much money.  Right.  You're like, all right, why?  Options?  What is that?  What's a stock option?  Well, the deal was he was going to give us 2,000 shares of ARS, I guess, at the time. 
[01:41:00]  American Radio Systems.  Which was turned over American Tower.  Yeah.  Whatever.  But it was 2,000 shares.  2,000 shares apiece, boys.  This is some good stock.  Here was the problem, though.  He wanted us to sign a five-year deal, and we only get 400 shares per year.  400 shares a year.  It's put away for you, boys.  Right.  But you will get, you'll receive at the end of each year 400 shares.  This is like a savings account.  Yeah.  You just put it away, and every year you get 400 shares. 
[01:41:30]  Eventually, after five years, you get 2,000 shares.  You have 2,000 shares of this grand stock, boys.  So the stock at the time was worth $44 a share.  Boys, it's $44 a share.  So I'm thinking, no bank account here, no bank account there.  Me, no, no way.  I'm thinking, well, I could do this math.  I'm going to have $88,000 in the bank after five years.  How great is that?  Yeah.  And he goes, this is a guarantee, boys. 
[01:42:00]  Boys, it's a sure thing.  This stock will never go down, boys.  And don't tell anybody.  Don't tell Schlockhole.  Don't tell Dave Dickless.  Don't tell Greg Hill.  Don't tell anybody else at the station.  He goes, the only people that have these stock options are me and you b-b-b-boys and Steve  Dodge.  We're like, well, it sounds all good and well.  Okay, ready for this?  We got that option four and a half years ago. 
[01:42:30]  So we still have to wait a half a year to get our last 400 shares.  That $88,000 that I was counting on, Anthony.  $88,000 is now worth, yes, $2,800.  $88,000.  Woo!  Woo!  Boys, put that away.  Just put it away.  Don't look at it because it'll break your heart. 
[01:43:00]  You dick!  It'll break your effing heart if you do look at it.  Put it away.  Actually, just throw it away.  What I meant was throw it away.  The stock, right before the show, I checked.  Yeah.  For a chuckle, it's worth $1.40 a share.  $1.40 a share.  $1.40.  And it was at what when we got it?  $44.  $44.  This was our retirement plan.  Yeah.  This was in lieu of a huge raise, Anthony. 
[01:43:30]  Boys, consider it...  And we don't even have the other 400 yet.  No, no, no.  We will get the next 400 in a few months, I guess.  Boys.  Total investment for you and I.  What a great...  $2,800 after five years!  In lieu of money.  In lieu of a raise we were supposed to get.  Boys, you're ignorant in the way of business.  What you have to do is take stock.  Everyone's doing it these days.  Right.  People don't take money anymore.  Right.  They have...  This is a golden parachute, is what it's called. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  It's a golden parachute that will turn into a lead weight.  Right.  And drop to the earth with you.  Oh.  Un-effing-believable.  Boys, years to come, this will be like when you go through your pants pocket and find  that $10 bill and go, ooh, I found a $10.  Just put it away.  Just put it away.  That's what it'll be worth.  And before you know it, you can buy a $10 bill with it.  And I remember also, it was $44 at the time, and he goes, this is guaranteed to go up. 
[01:44:30]  I wouldn't be surprised if this hits a hundred.  A hundred?  He did say that!  A hundred cents a share.  Now I'm thinking, wow, $88,000 guaranteed.  Already in my head, it's guaranteed money.  I just got to wait five years for it.  Could you imagine $200,000?  Like, rock.  Well, Bruce, guess what?  Yeah, boys.  It's worth $2,800 today.  Boys, enjoy the ride. 
[01:45:00]  It's on Brucey.  I can only hope he loaded up on that stock.  I can only hope, boys, this is going through the roof.  That is if the house was upside down.  What a toll.  Another great Brucey moment.  And no one sucks about that story.  We couldn't do the Martha Stewart thing.  Get the inside info and get out.  And dump.  We had to wait to get our shares.  We had no choice in the matter.  Yeah.  We had to wait five years to get fully invested. 
[01:45:30]  They wouldn't give it to us all at once.  No, because this was their incentive to keep us around.  To keep us around, right.  Boys.  This is great, boys.  Just put it away.  $2,800.  Find a drawer, open it, and just put it away in that drawer.  If the drawer is marked garbage, shoot.  Then you just drop it in, boys.  You know how much bragging I did with that, too?  Oh, did you?  I would show my relatives and my friends.  Look what I got. 
[01:46:00]  Look.  $2,000 shares.  Look.  Yeah, you can look it up on your computer for your shelf.  Check that quote.  Look, it's $44,000.  Five years from now, in the year 2003, this is going to be worth $88,000.  I have many shares in my portfolio.  He was talking about his portfolio.  Are you threatening me?  I am portfolio.  All right.  Barry's getting bored out there, so why don't we take a break?  Barry Williams up next on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:46:30]  Boo.  Stop with that funny Microsoft.  Hey, what happened to our couples?  They blew us off?  They haven't arrived.

We got a brand-new carpet, and we want a couple to christen it today.  Yep.  And you'll get a spot in Sex for Sam 3 tomorrow when it goes down here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  Easy.

[01:59:00]  Rome's Colosseum, Greek philosophy, and who could forget Egypt's pyramids?  Well, roll over Tutankhamen and tell Aristotle the news.  Here comes Holland.  The guys over there who created Amstel Light are responsible for perhaps the most important of all cultural breakthroughs, brewing a light beer that tastes like real beer.  Lots of people brew great-tasting beer, and lots of people brew beer that's low in calories.  But to brew a beer that gives you the best of both worlds, low calories and great taste, well, that's something truly historic. 
[01:59:30]  Now, I'm not claiming Amstel Light is the peak of civilization, but if you've ever choked down a bland, watery-tasting light beer, it's pretty high on the list.  So let's doff our caps to Amsterdam, sing their national anthem, and salute the makers of Amstel Light.  And if you don't know the words, well, make a jaunt down to your local store and pick up a 12-pack.  That'll work, too.  Always satisfying, never watered down, Amstel Light.  The beer drinkers light beer.  Imported by Amstel USA, White Plains, New York.  Getting all slap-happy, it's Adam and Dave from Tweeter.

[02:01:30]  Now, with over 300 ice-cold ways to quench your thirst,  it's inconceivable this man could leave 7-Eleven thirsty?  In short, this man is a liar!  7-Eleven's the only place to go when you're thirsty, so stop by today.  Right now, get three 24-ounce bottles of refreshing Deer Park Natural Spring Water for two bucks.  At participating stores, prices may vary only at 7-Eleven.  Oh, thank heaven.  Ah!  He's out there.  You won't see him coming.  But when he drops mad cash your way...

[02:05:00]  Boy, I guess.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony rock.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How about that, huh?  Finally, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got to explain, though. 
[02:05:30]  We did like 50 minutes of radio.  Non-stop, commercial-free, Anthony.  Right.  And then we tag it on the back end.  And then we've got to make up for lost time.  Yeah.  But in the studio, Barry Williams.  Barry.  How are you?  It's so nice to be in here.  You know, I feel bad already, though.  I've got to say.  What?  You feel bad for me?  No, I'll tell you what.  You brought the booze for the party.  Here's the booze.  But we don't have anything for you.  Usually when Barry Williams is in studio, there is some type of debauchery. 
[02:06:00]  No, you're lying to me, man.  I know you.  I tell you, you know, I wasn't on the board at all.  I'm Pavlovian that way.  You know, like with the little bell and the dog and the food.  And then the dog starts salivating with the bell.  Well, when it's O&A Day, I'm figuring sex day.  Yeah.  You always got a little surprise going on for me.  So I want to get in here and get going.  So what do you got for me?  Now, we've got debauchery almost every day.  So you've got to tell us, what have we given you so far on this show over the years?  Well, for one thing.  I remember the one time the stripper with the split.  Oh, that was...  But let me describe that. 
[02:06:30]  First of all, she walks in and she's a complete knockout.  Yeah.  And she's talking about her porn experience, which is not turning me off at all.  And the aunt just says to me, no, no, hang on tight.  That little thing's coming off fast.  Next thing I know, she's completely naked.  Totally nude, right.  Completely nude, which was just lovely just to kind of take in.  And then she waltzes over to me, asks me to stand up, and she does a handstand and rests  her legs around the back of my neck.  Yeah.  You had quite a view.  It was... 
[02:07:00]  I felt like I was in India with the camels.  I mean, it was just...  You know what?  I was wondering at that moment when she put her legs over your shoulders, you looked down.  I did.  And facing up at you.  I was wondering, did it remind you of the episode where you went down the Grand Canyon?  You're going down into the Grand Canyon.  On the donkeys.  On the donkeys.  Yes.  Because you were just looking down there into, well, another abyss.  No, no.  It reminded me of looking down up into heaven.  That's what I was thinking, man.  It was a beautiful sight.  Cindy! 
[02:07:30]  Bobby!  Yeah, Bobby and Cindy lost in there.  Then the next time I come in, somebody hands me a big shaver and a pair of shears and some  shaving cream.  And we got a girl on the table.  I'm going to try to be careful with the language here, but it was the lovely spot.  Yeah, it was getting shaved by a Brady.  It was pretty nice.  Ah!  Oh, ha!  Oh, ha!  Yes.  And then we had to draw, you know, we had to make little hearts, and then we made little  O's.  Right.  And then we had to, you know, go slowly.  Allegedly.  I remember we had to turn off the cameras that day, Barry. 
[02:08:00]  Yes, we did.  Are you admitting to something?  Yeah, I did.  I just admitted to it.  Now, the only day that was, and it was debauchery, but the only day that was still a little bit  in question was the peanut puppeteering.  You were here for that?  The penis puppeteering.  Wait, wait, wait.  They hate that word, which is ridiculous.  What do we call it?  What do we call it?  No, you should be able to say that, but it is because it's a show.  Art forms.  I guarantee they dumped out.  Art forms with the...  Mail junk.  With the mail junk.  Yeah, the puppeteer, they take their junk and make stuff.  But the sailboat and the hamburger and the hot dog, and we were just guessing. 
[02:08:30]  Right, because that was the day we were like, wow, after everything we've done when Barry's  been in here, this really sucks, because it was guys.  But he made the lock this much.  But that was fun, and I did make the lock.  That was pretty cool.  And it was not gay at all.  It was very, very...  It was kind of fun.  And now, where's the ding, ding, ding?  I'm feeling like...  Yeah, see what...  Okay, who's coming in the door?  That's what I'm looking for.  But we have something.  I have faith in our listeners, Anthony.  If our listeners screw up this time... 
[02:09:00]  Who wants to have...  Wait, wait, what's with the thumbs up?  Oh, oh!  I'm going to start with the Malibu rum.  Filling out the paperwork.  All right, Barry.  Well, we do have something for you, then.  Well, I brought the Malibu rum for us, so we can do that.  Barry, look around.  You see the new carpet?  Very fresh.  Look at the new carpet.  As a matter of fact, isn't it nice?  Notice no stains, right?  And my feet...  My shoes didn't stick to it this time.  Well...  Which is good.  We, um...  Hi, guys.  Well, it's funny you say that, because we're looking at the new carpet and thinking...  Beautiful.  ...thinking it's only a matter of time before somebody spills something on it or makes it 
[02:09:30]  disgusting.  Maybe some coffee, maybe juice, whatever.  And you know how some people, they don't want their car to be dinged, so they'll do it  themselves somewhere just to get it over with.  Yes.  We're going to do that with the carpet.  Just to get it over with?  Just to get it over with.  And christen the carpet with a stain.  Now, to make this stain, it wouldn't really make good radio to spill a little coffee or  juice or anything like that.  I don't think so.  That kind of radio now.  And it's not the right type of stain stuff, you know? 
[02:10:00]  It's not the right type of stain.  So, to make the stain, and Barry, it's just great you're in here to watch this, we solicited  for a couple to come up.  A couple?  A couple.  Nice.  A guy and a girl.  Nice.  They're going to come up in the studio.  And let's just say, without getting into any detail, they are going to make a stain on  the carpet.  All right.  Well, we'll see about that.  We'll see.  I'm holding you to that.  We're talking full action.  Full action.  For real. 
[02:10:30]  A full action for real stain will be made on the carpet.  Well, we do a little radio show.  Well, we just go about our business.  If they do that, I can set them up with free accommodations in Las Vegas.  How's that?  I set them up in Las Vegas or down in Nassau.  Either one.  They can have their choice.  Wait.  Are you kidding?  I'm not kidding.  Set them up.  I'll set them up.  Wow.  With what?  Absolutely.  With accommodations.  Well, that's it.  Set them up in a hotel.  Get them some show tickets out in Vegas.  That's a nice prize.  There we go.  Surprise?  If we see full action.  Correct?  What happened to you, Barry? 
[02:11:00]  Full action?  You have become a man.  You guys, I think you guys have made me famous.  I'll tell you what.  After the last time I was here, I was going to actually change my name to Greg Brady.  Really?  And I did for a short time.  Yeah.  I started working on the dinner reservations and different things and cutting in line and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Greg Brady.  Of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, what's happened, just when I started getting used to it, Peter Gabriel.  I don't know if you know this.  Peter Gabriel.  Someone's telling us today. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  He's coming out with his new album, right?  Yeah.  He's been ten years in the waiting.  His first single.  What's it called?  The Barry Williams Show.  And, like, he doesn't know me from Adam.  But he just wrote a song.  He was looking for a song with a name that musically fit his tune.  And it was Barry Williams.  The Barry Williams Show.  And that's Barry Williams Show.  But is he singing about you or another Barry Williams?  No.  He's not singing about any Barry.  He's actually technical.  I mean, it's kind of Jerry Springer-esque. 
[02:12:00]  That's kind of what the thing is about.  Uh-huh.  It's like this big indictment on cultural television stuff.  But he used my name.  So now we've got Sean Penn directing the video.  And Sean calls me up.  He says, hey, Barry.  How are you doing, man?  Great, Sean.  How are you?  Look at you.  Yeah, listen, man.  I got this.  Are you familiar with this Peter Gabriel gig?  I say, yeah.  I'm directing that.  Can you come?  Can you fall by tomorrow?  Well, I'm in Chicago. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, I was just thinking, you know, maybe we could come in and work you into the video somehow.  Because that would be kind of nice.  And in one moment, I said, yeah, I can be there tomorrow afternoon.  That would be fine, Sean.  No problem at all.  I'll just hop a flight and get on over there.  So I did.  It was very cool.  Peter was there.  And he got to meet me.  Because they've been laying all this stuff on him.  You know, when you use Barry over in England, where it's maybe not such a big deal.  But here it would create some confusion.  Yeah.  So now you see I'm stuck. 
[02:13:00]  Because I had just gone to Greg Brady.  I mean, I had just given up and just gone in that direction.  I was starting to make my reservations that way.  And now Peter Gabriel comes by and botches the whole thing out.  This is the first time I'm calling you by your real name.  I know.  That's why.  I'll be available.  Forever.  Finally did it.  I finally feel comfortable enough to call you by your real name.  And you want to be called Greg Brady again.  Can't do it.  Can't do it.  Peter has messed it up for me.  Peter Gabriel.  Honestly, yeah.  So what's up with the Malibu rum?  A Malibu rum is it.  Why don't we see any drinks mixed yet?  Yeah.  How do we get these things mixed? 
[02:13:30]  Let's get the cups out.  Let's get these things popped.  Let's get some Coke.  Malibu rum with the essence of coconut.  We'll get some Coca-Cola.  This is the craziest event endorsement I've ever been involved with.  This even is beyond boxing for me.  It's a nationwide event.  They're doing four.  Even crazier than that product that made your hair orange?  Oh, no.  No.  But that.  By the way, that's his first Brady reference, too.  Those are usually all Anthony's.  That's why I'm really looking at it.  He is living on the edge. 
[02:14:00]  I am stunned.  I am not yet.  I am stunned.  I am mixed to watching it.  Oh, my God.  I have TV land, and I'm thinking, you know, Barry's going to come in again.  And I've got to brush up a little bit.  Yes, you do.  You've got to get your TiVo kicked up, Barry Williams, and record.  You're good with the hair tonic.  Wasn't that the last episode?  Last episode.  Oh, man.  Right?  Oh, my God.  Look at Opie going out.  Stop it.  It was the last episode, too.  But that was Bobby who gave me that hair tonic.  Actually, you can use Malibu rum as hair tonic. 
[02:14:30]  As hair tonic.  It doesn't make your hair orange, but the chicks kick it.  I saw the Brady Bunch E! True Hollywood story that they did on it.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good one.  That's a good one.  It's like eight hours long or something.  How long are those costumes?  It's a two-hour special, man.  It's two hours.  That was a two-hour.  There's a lot of ground to cover with the Brady.  Come on.  It was very good.  Everything, everything you could ever want to know about the Brady.  Back then, we couldn't say that the dad was really gay or that my mom on TV was dating me.  Tee-hee.  The funniest part was finally, again, seeing some clips of the old Variety show. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, yeah, which has been, by the way, has been honored.  Yes, in TV Guide, right?  TV Guide is honored to put us on the cover again.  It was one of the 50 worst shows ever on television.  You don't have to go all the way explaining it.  You know, we were part of number one.  It was on the cover of TV Guide.  Hold on, hold on.  We got something in common, though.  We were part of one of the top 15 worst shows of all time.  We were involved with XFL Game Day, the pregame show.  Oh, God.  That was ours.  That was our baby. 
[02:15:30]  I think we made number four.  I think we're bonding, except, you know, I was on twice.  Right.  I was on twice because I was over the Brady Bunch Variety Hour plus Celebrity Boxing.  Oh, that was awesome.  That made the list worse.  Yeah, yeah.  That's ridiculous because that gets a lot of viewers.  I know.  Well, so did the Variety Hour this day.  That didn't make it good.  And Jerry Springer got number one, right?  He was the worst.  I think that was the one.  That was some fun TV for a while, too.  Oh, yeah.  But seeing the clips of the Variety show with the girls, like, diving in the pool. 
[02:16:00]  Yes.  And, uh...  Yes, what is the matter with that?  It just looked so schlocky.  Oh, but it was great.  And you guys in your disco outfits.  Those tight, spangled outfits.  Some of the funniest stuff ever.  I could watch, like, full episodes of those shows.  I wish.  Do you have those?  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I have.  Oh, we can make a whole weekend out of it, Ann.  Oh, yeah.  Me and you will drink some Malibu and just sit back and watch the goddamn show.  And let me just add this to it for your viewing pleasure, that those suits, those jumpsuits 
[02:16:30]  were so tight, we had to wear special types of underwear.  To hide the Brady junk.  The Brady junk.  You didn't stop?  No, no.  We couldn't.  No, no.  We didn't want...  They didn't...  The network would not have wanted that.  We didn't know which way we were dressing.  The Brady's don't have genitalia.  Those are tight.  They don't need it.  Not after the third year.  Of course.  God.  It was great.  It was just too good.  And what's his name?  Robert Reed.  Robert Reed.  Sure.  With his dancing and singing. 
[02:17:00]  He was in hell, wasn't he?  It was classic.  It was like a car wreck.  He was the one who wanted to do it.  He wanted to do it.  Well, he would always come back.  For all the misery that it seems that he had doing the original program, he came back  for every single time they were going to do another Brady show.  You know, finally, the producer, Sherwood Schwartz, got so upset with Robert Reed.  He didn't want to have anything to do with him again.  And they did this special called The Brady Girls Get Married.  Yeah.  A clever title, by the way.  Can you imagine what happened in the special? 
[02:17:30]  The Brady Girls Get Married.  So anyway, they were starting to cast a different father for them.  And Robert Reed called Sherwood and said,  No one is going to give my girls away except me.  Oh, my God.  Is that something?  That's weird.  Isn't that weird?  That was a little odd.  That was odd.  And then he was there complaining.  Oh, that was of all of them.  Did that make the list?  No, but you know what?  That could have run a 51 or two.  Then there was the other incarnation of the Brady Bunch that they kind of got serious. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, the Bradys.  In the 90s.  The Brady's in the 90s.  And it was serious.  And what?  Bobby was in the wheelchair.  Right.  And there were drinking problems.  Marsha was an alcoholic.  Yeah, Marsha was the alky.  And people just were freaking out like,  This isn't the Brady.  I don't want my Brady's drunk and paralyzed.  Sorry, it didn't last very long.  We all said, Whoa, okay.  Enough.  Enough.  We've done that now.  And then we're back to the movies.  Yeah.  Back to the movies again.  Too much.  Unbelievable.  What's going on with this couple? 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're here?  I hope they're hot.  You know.  Well.  Why is Ben watching porno?  What were you watching?  What were you watching, Ben?  I was looking at Foundry.  It's on Foundry.  Oh, it's on Foundry.  Oh, that's Taylor.  From Philly.  She sent some latest videos in.  Is she hobbing or is she?  She's.  Wow.  Look at that.  Hey.  Yeah.  There is some great pornography on FoundryMusic.com.  Yeah.  Check it out.  Look at Taylor getting it.  What is she getting?  This girl is a good friend of ours, Barry. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  We know her.  Well, where is she?  Can you introduce me?  That is fantastic.  She's doing that right now.  I didn't know you could bend your legs like that.  She is.  That's very nice.  She's getting hammered, huh?  Well.  Where's the money shot?  Where's the money shot?  Ben, I don't blame you.  All right, man.  I wonder why Ben's been quiet for half an hour.  Now, I'm not kidding about these trips.  And by the way, this is a whole company, an endorsement that I got hooked up with.  Vacation ownership endorsement out in Vegas.  And I can send people to Vegas and to Nassau and to Hilton Head with free accommodations  for calling a telephone number for everybody. 
[02:19:30]  Everybody.  Well, actually, the first thousand people that called.  But I'm not sure that they don't be on that.  And I'll give that number out a little bit later.  We'll see if we get some action.  Get some action.  I'm very serious about that.  All right, let's get the couple in here.  Let's meet the couple that's going to stain the carpet.  I think, Barry, you're going to have to be the judge to make...  Of course I will.  Where are the binoculars?  To make sure it's good enough for...  Hello?  Hello?  Hi, how are you?  Oh, very nice.  What's up?  What do we got?  Chewing gum.  I'm Ann.  I'm Ann.  Ann.  I'm Brett.  And Brett called earlier. 
[02:20:00]  This is Barry Williams.  What happened, you guys?  You said you were checking into a hotel?  Yeah, we're staying in the city tonight.  We got hit with a lot of traffic.  Nice to meet you.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, man.  We thought you guys were full of S.  No.  Do you guys want to do Sex for Sam tomorrow, too?  We're thinking about it.  We came in definitely for this one.  Okay.  Barry might give you guys a trip if you do well.  You want to go...  Where are you based?  Nassau work for you?  Or do you like Hilton Head or Vegas?  Like four days, three nights.  I can set up the accommodations for anyone. 
[02:20:30]  Vegas works for you.  Vegas, sure.  That's actually my favorite place, too.  All right.  I like you guys already.  That's very cool.  We'll get you set up.  Wow.  We'll get you set up on the strip in one of the hotels.  Get you some free show tickets.  And I think at this point, we should just refer to it as staining the carpet.  Staining the carpet.  Staining the carpet.  Because there will be nothing else.  It will just be called staining the carpet.  That's how we get around rules around here.  Right.  Everyone knows what's going on now.  Weren't you saying that they were hung up at a hotel there for a while?  Yeah.  I mean, are we sure they're fresh?  No, but they...  Oh, I don't know.  They were stuck in traffic.  Perhaps. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, traffic.  We saw it doing a little fluffing.  That didn't...  We figured we'd just let it fluff.  Save your fluffing for the studio.  You guys will become legendary today, by the way.  Yeah.  We'll always talk about the day that...  The carpet got stained.  We christened the new carpet.  Why don't we get Pete in here?  Isn't it?  Pete is...  He's loving the new carpet.  Yeah.  He doesn't think this is a good idea today.  Yeah.  Where's Pete Johnson?  Oh, it's a good idea today.  I really think it is.  Oh, of course.  It's a good idea today.  Today?  Barry...  It's Wednesday.  Yeah, I know.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Come on.  Absolutely.  We've got a question for Barry as we get Pete. 
[02:21:30]  Mike, what's up?  What's up, Barry?  How are you?  Hey, man.  Listen, I've got two guys that would be perfect for celebrity boxing.  I love it.  I'm taking suggestions right now, so let's go.  Stephen Hawking and Christopher Reeve.  Now, Stephen Hawking is a physicist, so we can't let him add anything to the chair.  I figure we'd be a bold helmet.  Put him in other hands, you know?  Oh, man.  You know, Barry, you think that's a sick idea, but...  I think that...  You know what the ratings would do?  If you could pull that one off.  I say you guys combine yourselves with a battle box and just have people remote control their  wheelchairs and have them pair each other up.  You could put...  Maybe Hawking's going to have a flamethrower on his head. 
[02:22:00]  This is like the Stevie Wonder and the Ray Charles match, you know?  Hey, hey, hey.  Don't steal our idea.  Hey, we did blind boxing.  You did that?  We did blind boxing.  Oh.  We had two blind guys.  Barry, you want ratings?  Did you put little things, little noisemakers on the end of the gloves so they knew where they  worked?  No, at first, we had bells.  Listen to your pals, Opie and Anthony.  We don't have a TV show yet, okay?  We're working on things, though.  You want ratings?  I want ratings.  Blind boxing.  Blind boxing.  I'm telling you.  It's so goddamn funny. 
[02:22:30]  I'm telling you.  Picture the bell ringing.  I love it.  Two guys just missing each other by an inch as they walk by each other.  Do we have a clip of blind boxing?  They almost brush shoulders.  They come so close, and they're in the boxing stance.  At one point, they were both standing an inch apart, back to back.  Going like this.  Throwing punches at the air.  That is so wrong.  That is so wrong.  One guy was at a 90 degree angle to the other guy punching the air.  Oh, jeez.  It was so goddamn funny.  It's on Fox, right?  Celebrity boxing?  Celebrity boxing. 
[02:23:00]  Of course.  Don't go.  Don't go.  Fox will do it.  Fox will do it.  I'm telling you, Barry.  Someone else will do it.  Blind boxing.  We get that TV show.  We're doing it.  It's good.  But you do it.  I'll ref.  I'll ref.  It sounds like a safe place to be.  Yeah.  That's great.  The rounds only last.  Well, the hitting only lasts for seconds.  Because the second they come in contact with anything, they start punching.  So at one point, Rick was standing by the phones.  Right.  And one of the boxers backed up into Rick and spun around and clocked him in the face.  Rick got knocked out. 
[02:23:30]  And Rick went down to the floor.  Rick got knocked out.  Rick got knocked out.  It can happen.  And ready for this?  One of the guys calls us a few days later.  Three broken ribs?  Yeah.  And a bruised spleen.  Bruised spleen and a bruised kidney.  Because he can't protect himself.  He doesn't know whether they're coming.  Fox is the same way.  When you get on the celebrity boxing, they literally make you sign your life away.  Yeah.  Like if you die during the match, they don't want to hear from you.  Now, Fox's problem.  Yeah, exactly.  That would hold up.  Sure.  Right.  And they have the right to play your death over and over again. 
[02:24:00]  Do you think Ann would be more comfortable if she just kind of slipped her little chemise  off there?  Oh, Barry.  Barry, that's a great suggestion.  Very nice.  Wow.  Ann, there you go.  A little piercing going on.  That's nice.  We should let people know.  A little bit of piercing.  I'm very good.  Left side lip.  I will guess C's.  Very good.  And I will go.  I'm very good at this.  37.  36.  36.  Oh, there you go.  Wow, Opie.  You know your breasts.  God damn you.  I'm never wrong.  You know your breasts.  God damn Opie.  And I know her age if she would, uh... 
[02:24:30]  Well, you know what?  She would have a chance.  I will be able to tell you how old this girl is by looking at her.  Oh, good God.  I am a little curious about the ornamentation in the left vestibule.  What?  That's a little barbell piercing she has on one of her nips.  Yeah.  That's fine.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Are you guys nervous?  We don't bite.  We don't bite, I suppose.  Oh.  No, we don't bite either.  Well, he's just...  You haven't probably done this a lot, right?  Now, no performance anxiety.  Do you have any performance anxiety?  I think I'll be okay in that. 
[02:25:00]  Have you...  Stack or two.  Have you ever done anything in front of people like this before?  Are you into...  In such a grand fashion.  Not as such.  But you've been involved, what, with other couples or other people?  No, with other couples, yeah.  Are you swingers?  Are you swingers?  Okay.  Yeah?  That's a good term.  That works.  Why don't they just go over there and, you know, just get comfortable.  Just get comfortable, whatever.  And we'll fiddle about.  Fiddle about.  Fiddle about.  We're just going to do the show.  All right.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  We're going to talk about Malibu Rum and karaoke and stuff for a little bit later.  Yeah, we're just going to continue our radio show and if something happens over there,  something happens.  Yeah.  Where's Pete?  Where's Pete?  Oh, Pete's got to come in and watch.  He's very pissed off.  I want it to be like that scene in Hardcore where George C. Scott had to watch his daughter  getting pounded on the film screen.  He doesn't understand that we're all dysfunctional around here.  He's so proud of the new rug and things.  Hey, this is a way to, you know, spice up the environment.  This is great.  You know, this is going to be wonderful.  Well, we have 30 seconds. 
[02:26:00]  Should I explain what these trips are all about in case they go?  This is just take a second.  Okay.  This vacation ownership is called.  What trip are they going for, by the way?  They're going for Las Vegas and that is a very cool one.  You've got to impress him.  That is a cool one.  Okay.  That is a very cool one.  This is a Club de Soleil.  Club de Soleil.  And what they do, they'll put you up for four days, three nights.  And in Vegas, it's on a strip hotel.  They'll give free show tickets for calling.  I'm listening, Barry.  I'm just not watching you.  For calling a telephone number.  Now, this thing's usually worth about $600, but I can offer to your listeners for calling 
[02:26:30]  a number.  Now, there are three places you can consider.  Las Vegas.  Here we go.  We're getting started.  I love this part.  Las Vegas.  Oh, wait, Pete.  Nassau and Hilton Head.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, no, no.  Finish.  Who's here?  Is this her dad?  No, this is Pete Johnson.  Oh, okay.  This is Pete.  He's been working for the station for 40 years, Pete.  And he's never been in here before.  Almost 44 years.  44 years.  He is so proud.  He's 10 and a half months from retirement.  He is so proud of this new carpeting that is in this studio. 
[02:27:00]  The old carpet was really ravaged.  It had been destroyed by, I guess, years of abuse.  And our show alone has put more stains on the carpet.  We put the dog years on the carpet.  Yeah.  Finally, that old carpet ripped from the studio.  Brand new carpeting put down that Pete is very proud of.  You know what I think?  This is space age material here, so I'm not sure that they could damage it.  Well, they're going to give it a good try.  A good try.  Pete, look what they're doing over there.  What's going on?  They're fiddling about. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, it's a little fiddling.  Fiddling about.  Fiddling about.  Get that song.  I need the song now.  Fiddling about.  Fiddling about.  Oh, thank you.  Tommy.  There we go.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Hey, can you get the Tommy CD?  We've got to play fiddle about.  All right.  So while they're warming up here, I'm going to give out these two numbers.  Okay.  You want to go to Las Vegas.  877-22-VEGAS.  Call 877-22-VEGAS.  Tell them when you want to go, and we'll work that out.  Now, if you want to go to Nassau or Hilton Head, 877-9-FUN-SUN. 
[02:28:00]  877-9-FUN-SUN.  Now, I'm going to sweeten the pot, okay?  Yeah.  If this works out, not only are we going to put you up over there, I'm going to fly you  there and back as well.  Fly you back and forth.  So it's the total, total package.  Wow.  All for a little getting down and going forward.  I don't even know what's going on.  You just impressed Greggy.  It's hilarious.  I can't see it. 
[02:28:30]  It's like she's searching for another dead mouse.  Is she?  Oh, that, okay.  We're looking for the canoe.  That'd be safe to say.  I have the worst view in the house.  They're fit.  Because I don't know.  Oh, well, is he doing anything with her?  No.  Well, okay, now he is.  But just before, are we using...  Well, because that I couldn't see.  Hey, uh...  Although, I would have to see other things.  Is that what you're saying?  Exactly.  Oh, okay.  Hey, can I have somebody run out and grab some Wesson oil? 
[02:29:00]  I've always wanted to see how that works.  We want to have a Wesson oil party a little bit.  I think we should start now.  Just see if it works.  We can warm it up.  Wessonality.  Anything going on over there, Brett?  It's coming.  There's a lot of people in here.  Well, don't worry about us.  We're just doing a radio show.  Wow, this is good.  Exactly.  When you start growing, you know, we'll start looking.  This is real good with a little Coca-Cola.  A little Coca-Cola, pineapple juice, something.  Oh, you know where I'm doing this event? 
[02:29:30]  Tomorrow night.  No idea.  Have you heard of this place?  Yeah.  That's the name of the place.  No idea on 20th.  Be down there at 630.  We're going to do a little karaoke with the Malibu rum thing.  Oh, you are?  Oh, you jump in the shower with me.  That's why we call it Shower Palooza.  You get to shower with you.  Exactly.  You're going to be showering with something?  Well, there's no water.  There's no water.  I mean, but you know, people sound better in the shower.  No idea.  Come on.  You get it.  It's a little gimmick.  Pete, are you all right with this?  Basically the gig.  Pete's not happy.  What's wrong, Pete?  What's the matter, Pete?  No, it's all right. 
[02:30:00]  All right?  Because the carpet's still under warranty, so you can face for it.  I love this.  He's worried about the carpet.  The carpet's still under warranty.  He's so bummed.  He's like, I can't do anything nice for you guys.  You ruin everything.  Is there any...  What's noises?  Yeah, but...  Oh, something's working.  Well, we shouldn't explain what's going on.  I just wanted to listen a little.  Oh, okay.  Enjoying the show.  You enjoy the show your way? 
[02:30:30]  I'm tired of sitting down.  I've got to stand up.  I bet I can look without seeing anything.  Why is she lifting very heavy boxes?  I think, you know, at this point, I think...  At this point, I think Erin would be more comfortable maybe sans underwear.  She might be more comfortable that way.  And what do you think?  What do you think?  What was that?  I missed it.  You may be more comfortable without your panties.  Yeah, actually, now that you mention it.  Oh, my God.  This couple is not shy.  Hey!  Look at that.  Oh, and we have more jewelry.  Bravo.  This is better.  This is more...  She's more relaxed now.  And that's the whole point. 
[02:31:00]  No, that's it.  That's it.  No, she's got jewelry around her hips.  She's got one of those gold belts.  Oh, gold belts.  Oh, okay.  Gold belts around her.  That's very attractive.  Yeah, don't describe anything.  Hey, Barry, we found a clip of blind boxing for you.  Blind boxing.  Just in case you thought we were full of s.  N.E.W. on Foundry.  We're going to watch it right here in the studio.  No, it's an audio clip, which really is kind of silly.  Oh, audio clip.  The video...  This is great.  Blind boxing on the radio.  And you can't see it. 
[02:31:30]  It's a video.  You can't see it.  You can only hear it.  But we're that damn good.  You are that good.  It's good radio.  We make it make sense.  I want to hear this.

The quartet from Dallas, Texas has been performing  as one of the main stage attractions on OddsFest.  As of now, the cause of death has yet to be determined.  We were just hanging out with this guy less than a month ago. 
[02:44:00]  Ben was hanging out with him on the lawn in Philly.  We love Drowning Pool.  Everyone thought it was Phil from Pantera.  Who would think that guy would die first?  Wow, no one knows why, though?  No, it's just breaking news.  Wow.  Do we have any audio of him?  Yeah, we're going to try to find something.  When did it happen?  They found him this afternoon, hours ago. 
[02:44:30]  On his tour bus?  Uh-oh, that don't sound good.  I remember we were talking to him about religion and stuff.  Yeah.  And he wasn't into organized religion.  What, Ben?  No.  Oh, okay.  Once again, Dave Williams, lead singer of Drowning Pool, found dead on the tour bus today.  No relationship to Barry.  No relationship to Barry.  No.  No, there you go.  I hope not.  The only thing we have in common is we're both hanging out with you.  Is that a bad idea?  No.  No.  Our average is pretty good.  Okay.  As far as guests and dead people. 
[02:45:00]  Very sorry.  Very sorry about this.  We're not bad.  We've had a few people die that we've talked to.  Oh.  Remember the mom that would change her daughter to herself because the daughter was so bad?  This goes back to the Boston days.  She ended up dying.  Oh, right.  We had an interview with her.  It was a big national story.  Tiny Tim.  Tiny Tim.  He died.  Let's see.  Who else?  Oh, oh, Mr. Scooby-Doo.  Mr. Scooby-Doo. 
[02:45:30]  Mr. Scooby-Doo is dead.  The guy that did Scooby-Doo's voice.  You didn't talk to Dana Plato, did you?  No.  No, but after Dana Plato, because, you know, you heard about that whole thing.  She does a radio interview and then she died.  Right, right.  The radio show gets a bunch of publicity.  So right after that happened, we started calling Buddy Ebsen every day.  This is a true story, Barry.  We called Buddy Ebsen every day of the week, and that son of a bitch has been alive.  We started that bit four years ago.  We gave up on it.  We had to.  The guy's like 98 now.  He's still alive.  He's still going strong. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, he calls us every so often, and he's like, good.  Now I'm feeling better.  Oh, Henny Youngman.  Henny Youngman.  Yeah, we had spoken to Henny, and he died.  Dave Williams, drag.  That is a drag.  That's the guy from the drowning pool.  Lead singer of the drowning pool, found dead on the tour bus today.  Anthony?  Yeah.  We've got to move on with the show.  Yes, we do.  Barry Williams in studio.  There's, um...  And Brett and Ann in the corner.  They've shifted position.  They are officially...  Staining the carpet.  Christening the new carpet that was laid down today. 
[02:46:30]  Now, Opie, can we get technical for just a second here?  Yes.  Because we're talking about carpet staining, right?  So certain things would have to occur at a certain point in the operation here in order  to create the desired effect of release upon carpet.  Yes.  And I'm not sure if...  Is Brent aware that that's...  I mean, the whole thing is riding on that, because at the appointed...  It's...  Wait.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm talking over.  You're the official judge.  Are you happy with what you're seeing?  Well, so far...  This is for a trip to Vegas.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Just a quick... 
[02:47:00]  There's a quick turnover here.  We're going top to bottom.  Bottom to top.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm impressed.  You've got to keep that t-shirt up, though.  Why do you want to see his naked torso?  It's not that...  You don't want to see it.  You've got to see...  I'm looking for the action, Ope, okay?  Just looking for the action.  He's a mess.  What, Ant?  Let me see.  Let me see what's up.  Ant's pretty impressed over there.  They're doing some staining. 
[02:47:30]  She's actually going into a...  Sort of a metaphysical state now.  Yeah, like she's got the head...  The head's back.  The eyes are back.  Yeah.  Things are going on.  Let's just be quiet for a moment.  Ope, they're in a certain point now  where I think you could get a good look  at a certain area  so you could guess age.  You know what I mean?  Well, I am feeling my powers today.  How does this work?  You can tell age?  I've never been wrong. 
[02:48:00]  No, come on.  I've never been wrong.  Actually, I've heard this before,  but I don't believe it.  He has 100% on this.  And how does this work?  He has always got...  He can look at a girl's...  Well, let's just say the taint.  Okay.  He can look...  I think we have said it.  So there we go.  He can look at the taint.  It's kind of like when you cut a tree in half.  Oh, yeah.  The rings, the circles.  The rings and stuff.  But he never gives real specifics  on what he's looking for,  what he's looking at,  but he has never, ever been wrong. 
[02:48:30]  My dad had this talent  and he passed it down to me.  Yeah.  Let me ask this question.  Does it affect your ability  if such taint is in an aroused?  Yes, it does, Barry.  Okay.  Yes.  And in what way does it affect?  I have to use some math skills.  There's math involved.  Yes.  There's a lot of math.  He does some calculations.  It's not as easy as counting rings, Barry.  I understand.  I'm beginning to understand that.  A lot of things into consideration.  Well, Opie, if you get up and take a look...  This tends to be impressive.  Well, you don't want to...  I don't want to be over there right now.  The timing might be good.  I think the timing might be very good. 
[02:49:00]  No, I don't want to be over there.  It really should.  Wait.  I, you know, I am feeling my powers,  but I don't really want to guess his age.  Just slip around the back there.  I don't want to be guessing his age, Anthony.  This isn't a two-for-two today.  I'm sorry.  Ant, that mic's not on.  What?  They plugged that in for the field mic.  Does it work for men in the outer area there?  I haven't tried it. 
[02:49:30]  Let's not.  Let's not.  I'm not suggesting you do.  I was just curious.  Anthony, if they could try another...  Another way of doing the stain attempt.  What?  We're re-fluffing.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, then this would be a good opportunity for Opie to get a look.  I thought he was doing...  I thought...  Oh, right there.  There we go.  I thought he was doing the...  Dr. Opie.  I'm almost staining the carpet.  No, no, no.  I have to stop.  Dr. Opie, this would be a good examination time. 
[02:50:00]  I need a mic.  Hey, you notice my technique?  I'm looking over the area like I'm Tiger Woods lining up a putt.  Lining up a putt.  Well, um...  Sure.  Sure.  Wow.  Full frontal.  Take a look.  Dude, could you, like...  Move...  Yeah, thank you.  You're messing up the powers a little bit.  Uh-huh.  Do you need any extra light?  Like a flashlight?  Spotlight?  Anything?  Yeah.  The extra light might be helpful.  Dave, if you will, please. 
[02:50:30]  Bend that light down a little bit.  Oh, I'm going to have...  Oh, there you go.  I'm going to have to...  Let's light up the...  I'm going to have to add a year for that right there.  Tinder area.  Add a year or subtract?  No, add.  Add?  Okay.  I was going to go younger, Anthony, until I saw...  Oh, you are?  You see right there?  Right.  Right.  All right.  Yeah, okay.  I don't know what I'm looking at.  I don't have this talent.  Uh-huh.  There's a lot of stuff in the way that's kind of messing up my abilities.  Perhaps we can convince Anne to part the sea a little bit. 
[02:51:00]  There's a lot going on there.  Well,  Okay.  All right.  Sure.  You're very natural down there.  Well, yeah.  Let's just say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not unattractive.  Not unattractive at all.  Very attractive.  Just natural.  Well, you being raised in the 70s, you know...  Yes, exactly.  You being...  That might be what's...  Anne, could you turn around...  What?  She's got to like...  Yeah, like...  Yes.  Oh, oh, oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  Now you're getting it. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  You got brand new carpet fibers on you.  Oh, my God.  You got nasty rug burns on your back.  You see that?  Cool.  All right, Anne.  I think I'm ready.  All right.  Give Anne the mic.  This is Mike.  I might be wrong with this one.  Somebody pass me a little more Malibu rum, please.  Oh.  Thank you.  All righty.  I may be wrong now.  Are you doing your calculations in your head?  Make sure you get it right.  Yeah, there's two years. 
[02:52:00]  And if they weren't doing what they were doing, I think I would have nailed it.  It's that excitement.  If they weren't staining the carpet...  You got a mic on them?  Because I want to get their reaction.  Okay, what's your guess?  I'm like David Blaine when it comes to this stuff.  Yeah.  Will you stop doing that, bro?  Well, he's got to do things.  And I'm going to go with the age...  Oh, man.  You're legally drinking, right?  Okay, good, good, good. 
[02:52:30]  Well, I should hope so.  Jesus.  23.  On the nose.  Wow.  Amazing.  Barry gets 23 too.  Barry wrote it down too.  I had it right over here.  Wow.  You've got the same powers?  I'm so impressed.  I was looking in another area, but it seemed to work out okay.  Wow.  23?  23.  It'll be 24 in December.  Look at that.  There we go.  Congratulations.  You're good, Opie. 
[02:53:00]  Your record is still good.  Let me tell you something, Barry.  I was going to say 24.  Where are you?  She's like 23 and a half.  That's what threw me off.  I could have went into...  See?  It's like half a year.  Screws you up.  Wow.  What is it?  Where's the math?  He's a...  Look, man.  It's my only bit for the radio show.  Don't ask too many questions.  The math.  He's a very talented.  Because I saw you.  I did some addition, and then you did some subtraction.  Don't take my only bit away, Barry.  No, no.  Not at all, man.  Just shut up and just go with it.  I'm loving it.  Act like you're impressed.  I am impressed.  I am more than impressed. 
[02:53:30]  23, Anthony.  Very good.  Very lovely.  Are you guys done with the christening?  No, they're not done, Barry.  No, no.  Hey, Barry's in a new movie.  Well, is it...  How about that?  No, it's still being made?  It is still being filmed, right?  It's David Spade's new picture.  And how's this...  I could have written it.  It's called Dickie Roberts, Former Child Star.  And it's all about a former child star who wants to get back in the limelight.  Now, I can't relate, but it seems to be a good vehicle for him. 
[02:54:00]  And the hook on this deal is every Thursday night, he has a poker game with former child stars.  Aha.  So they're the usual suspects.  We round them up.  We got a little Danny Bonaduce, Leif Garrett.  Does Danny have to be in everything?  Well, you know...  I want to see other former child stars.  Yeah.  He's in everything.  Yeah, he's pretty good in this.  He really is.  And...  Are you just kissing his ass?  You're scared of him, aren't you?  Why do I have to kiss his ass?  Are you kidding?  He didn't beat you up.  No, no, no.  He's scared of him.  Dustin Diamond.  He's in it. 
[02:54:30]  Dustin Diamond.  Corey Feldman.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  You don't let Dustin talk, do you?  No, the kind of fun thing is...  And David Spade.  So the kind of...  The fun thing is...  So, like, we're going around and we're adding and I'll do things like...  I'll say, okay, I'm going to raise 20 bucks.  Well, actually...  Actually, four bucks and these.  The actual braces that Marsha wore in the Brace Yourself episode.  Easily worth 16 bucks on eBay.  You're betting with memorabilia.  Yes, here's the Jinx Tiki Idol. 
[02:55:00]  Easily...  You could probably scam it for $5,000 if you claim it's original.  Yeah.  That's how we're betting.  That would go for some big cash.  I'd probably...  I would bet on something like the Tiki Idol.  I bet you would.  Imagine having that.  I bet you would.  But that's gone, right?  I have it.  You actually...  Have I not brought that in for you?  You don't bring the stuff in.  No.  You brought the jacket in.  I brought the jacket in.  I let you...  Wait, the jacket.  I totally dug that.  You really have the actual idol?  I have the idol.  And the next time I'm here, I will bring it.  Oh, my God.  A picture with the Tiki Idol. 
[02:55:30]  Stop it.  Yeah, but don't break it.  I would love that.  I would not break it.  Okay.  Should I not touch it?  It is taboo.  I've had this for a long time.  I have to go to Mr. Hanale.  A little talk.  Yeah, I have that.  I'll bring it in.  Speaking of former child stars...  Oh, yeah.  We came across this website today, Barry.  You're what?  And you're on it.  What website?  God, I'm afraid to ask.  Former child star dot net.  Oh, God.  Really?  And they got pretty much everybody. 
[02:56:00]  And what they're doing now...  Former child star dot net.  It's a great website to check out.  And is it a where are they now kind of deal?  Pretty much.  Yeah, it's sort of that.  They have their last appearances, what they did.  Oh, that must be hysterical.  You got like Emanuel Lewis.  Yeah, what's up with Emanuel?  Though almost as well known for being toted on stage with Michael Jackson at the American  Music Awards in the mid-80s, Lewis has led a decidedly non-glitzy life since Webster  wrapped up in 87.  He's had a couple of guest spots on the USA series, but he's the kind of guy that's still  kind of doing okay. 
[02:56:30]  We may have to break away from Emanuel here in a minute.  I'm not sure, Anthony.  Just be ready.  I'm just letting you know.  The guy's starting to...  Uh-oh.  Here comes the stain.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Do they win the trip to Vegas?  Oh, my God.  Oh, God, no.  Thank you for not disappointing me today.  Oh, my God. 
[02:57:00]  What do we think?  Brent and I think you two are going round trip to Las Vegas on me.  Stay there for four days, three nights.  Have a ball.  Show tickets.  Come on your way.  I'm going to be sick.  Did she get unscathed?  Are you unscathed?  Let's just put it that way.  Yes.  She's unscathed.  The floor is ruined.  She is unscathed.  Well, we have a stain on the floor.  It's our first stain. 
[02:57:30]  Watch your feet.  Pete, watch the mic cord.  Pete's walking down the hall shaking his head.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Pete.  Hey, Pete.  Pete Johnson's in here.  Pete, look at the carpet.  Look at it, Pete.  Look at it.  Pete, look at the carpet, man.  Look at it, man.  Look at it.  Well, this will be a test.  That's all.  It'll be a test for the carpet.  A test?  It'll be a test for the person who cleans it up.  Oh, my goodness.  Watch, don't step in it.  Just don't step in it. 
[02:58:00]  Don't step in it.  You might slip and hurt yourself.  Why don't we mark off the area so Ron and Fez don't...  Yeah, put some police...  Do we have police tape?  Yeah, do we have some...  Pete, do you have some tape that we...  Do you have police tape or something?  Let's get some tape.  Tape off that corner.  Get that area.  Yeah.  There goes Pete.  He's not happy with us.  Wow.  Look at Pete's leaving.  Look, he's really pissed.  He gets...  He is so pissed off right now.  Oh, my God.  I'm reading his mind right now. 
[02:58:30]  Why do I bother?  Why do I bother?  10 months, 14 days, 23 hours to retirement.  And then I won't have to put up with these shenanigans.  Anyway.  Now, they did answer the call, right?  You put out the call.  They came in.  We put out the call.  We asked for a couple to come in and stay in the car.  And they did.  They did.  Now, the big question.  Buy gum.  The big question.  Are you guys going to do Sex for Sam 3 tomorrow? 
[02:59:00]  Perhaps.  I think you guys will do well.  You perform well under pressure.  You're not shy.  He's sweating.  He's already over the air.  Of course he is.  Uh-oh, Pete.  Tape off tape.  Pete has to tape off the area.  Pete.  Pete.  Wait a minute.  Pete Johnson.  Pete Johnson.  To run some tape from the CD thing over to the side to tape off the area.  Yeah.  Like a crime scene.  Because it pretty much is.  Well, yeah.  Then why PD's going to be here, Anthony?  You see what's going on over there?  Oh, my God.  He's taping off the new stain on the brand new carpet. 
[02:59:30]  The carpet is less than three hours old.  Less than three hours old.  And it already has the most heinous of heinous stains that you can imagine.  There is nothing worse that you could do to this carpet.  There really isn't.  Look at me.  He's so bad.  What's a little spilt coffee now that a money shot has landed squarely on the...  Yeah, you might as well just throw your coffee on the floor now.  Oof.  All right, Pete. 
[03:00:00]  Are you happy?  You made us do that, Pete.  Yeah.  You kind of forced us.  I hope Scott in the morning doesn't get upset with this.  Why?  Because maybe he felt he missed out on it.  He wanted to be here.  Oh.  What?  I don't know.  Thank you, Pete.  It's engineering.  Anyway, so we're talking about the website formerchildstar.net, right?  Yeah.  There's a couple other good ones over there?  Oh, yeah.  A couple of...  Remember little Danny from The Shining? 
[03:00:30]  Danny Lloyd?  Danny Lloyd.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  From The Shining.  Yeah.  Remember the cute little kid on the big wheel going through the...  Oh, yeah, of course.  Right, right.  Through the hallways on his big wheel.  Well, there were conflicting reports that he was either a science teacher in Illinois...  It's really bad.  They're setting up mic stands to wrap the tape from the CD, uh...  This big CD collection. 
[03:01:00]  It goes to the mic stand and now it goes to the cart racks...  It's like...  Where he's taping off the area so no one can tread on the evidence.  It's like police tape.  Yeah.  You better hang a sign.  Caution, caution.  You better hang a sign.  Yeah.  Put a hazardous material...  Here comes the renews it.  Do we have a biohazard sign?  Put a biohazard sign on it.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Anyway, yes.  Yeah, a little...  What happened to him, Lloyd?  What happened? 
[03:01:30]  Well, they say that he was a science teacher, but they couldn't find a science teacher in  Morton, Illinois with his name.  But there are people that swear that they worked with him and he was a checkout guy at  a Walmart ten years ago and that's the last they saw of him.  Wow.  Was going from a huge movie like The Shining to a checkout guy at a Walmart.  So, you know, you're doing very well.  You're still busy.  Oh, yeah.  You're in the business.  You're doing things.  Malibu Shower Palooza.  Don't miss it.  Tomorrow night.  No idea.  20th Street.  And that's not all. 
[03:02:00]  Tin Alley in Garden City.  Friday night.  Oh.  Are you out there that way?  Be there.  Be there.  Karaoke with me.  Karaoke.  You got a couple more there, Ant?  Remember Lisa Loring?  Oh, yeah.  Wednesday Addams?  I loved her.  She was great.  Pigtails, right?  Yeah.  She was married to...  She did well, right?  Porn legend Jerry Butler.  Oh, there you go.  She married up.  And she did some kind of racy scenes, but never hardcore porn.  Never hardcore.  Not my Lisa Loring.  Little Wednesday Addams married a porn star.  Oh, nice.  Then, you know who Peter Ostrom is? 
[03:02:30]  He was little Charlie Bucket from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  Was he the big guy?  What happened to Charlie?  He's working as a veterinarian in upstate New York.  Like, what happens?  What about, um...  Who's this guy?  Hold on.  Oh, oh, Mike Lookinland.  Mike Lookinland, right?  Right.  He, Bobby Brady.  Last seen handling first assistant camera duties.  Oh, yeah?  In the CBS Family Series.  Does that all the time. 
[03:03:00]  He never stops working.  All right.  Little trivia here for either one.  Either one of you.  Opie, Anthony.  Yes.  Who's Brady birthday is it today?  Don't say it's yours.  It's been in Biden present.  No, no.  Brady birthday.  I would just be guessing.  I'm going to go with Alice.  That's a good guess, but not right.  No?  Is it Florence Henderson?  It is not Florence.  It's one of the kids.  One of the kids.  One of the kids, okay.  One of the kids.  All right.  How old?  Well, that'll be a dead giveaway.  That really is.  Necessarily?  Yeah, 23. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, then it's Cindy.  It's Cindy.  Yeah.  It is Cindy.  Susan Olson.  Yes, Susan Olson.  Little Susan.  I'm 42, I think, today.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, I'm younger than she is now.  It wasn't easy.  How'd you swing that?  Yeah, well.  I turned around, man.  Little Judy Brady is 42 years old.  Great.  And as you look up more child stars, I've got to go to Rich Voss really fast here, okay?  He's down at Chemistry in Philly.  I'm at Chemistry.  Hey, Voss.  What's happening?  What's up?  Well, I'm just down here at Chemistry. 
[03:04:00]  You're starting to fill up, man.  Some hot girls here, too.  Yeah?  Hot Cane's going to play.  When are the festivities starting?  Because we want to play some of the audio on the show today.  Probably around like 620.  I think the band's going to go on first.  Octane.  Oh, my God.  You guys got to get Laverne Shirley up there so we can play it for 20 cities.  They are so aggravating.  All they do is follow me around and repeat the same thing all day.  They are horrible.  I'm telling you, I'm talking to a hot girl and they walk up and they just ruin everything. 
[03:04:30]  I swear.  You're the worst.  You look at her.  You know what?  The little one.  What's the little one?  Marion?  The little one?  Yeah, the little fat troll.  Marion, right?  Marion, Marion.  I look at her hair and it looks like a hobbit's foot.  She's disgusting and they're getting on my nerves.  She's horrendous.  She looks like a character from a Dr. Seuss book.  They're getting paid in peanuts, these elephants.  They're throwing them nuts at them.  Voss.  And my transmission blew up last night. 
[03:05:00]  Voss, Voss, before Octane goes on, you've got to get the retard of Laverne Shirley in front of that crowd.  Because we've got the Zephyr hooked up.  We can play it for 20 cities.  Yeah.  Do you want me to bring him on stage now or what do you want me to do?  Do you want me to...  Get it all set up and ready to go, I think.  And then we can go to you and let you know when to exactly do it.  Also, Voss, I think Friday we're going to...  Are you doing Sex for Sam tomorrow?  Yeah.  All right.  He's going to be one of the spotters for Sex for Sam 3 tomorrow. 
[03:05:30]  Voss, we think we got the audio of Billy Staples bombing at Norton Show.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think we're going to have it hopefully tomorrow or Friday.  Well, I mean, we've been talking about it.  Ron and Fez have been talking about it.  And I do believe we got audio of Billy Staples bombing.  Yeah.  Let me tell you, I told him, I even told Ron and Fez this.  After the show, I wouldn't let him stand next to me when I was selling my CDs because  I was going to lose sales.  It was so painful.  People would walk up to me and go, great show, and look at him like he wasn't even there. 
[03:06:00]  You know, Barry, this guy, Billy Staples, he's a funny guy, but he never had a chance because  they set it up in a way pretty much telling the listeners to just kill him.  To not laugh.  Just kill him when he walks out on stage.  Not laugh.  They couldn't even hear him because he was...  I mean, they just out-screamed what he could do with a microphone.  They were yelling, get the F off the stage, you fat F.  You suck.  It was so bad, the guy hasn't been seen since.  That is a nightmare.  That is a nightmare.  It's an ongoing soap opera here in New York. 
[03:06:30]  The guy still, he refuses to show his face since.  Oh, man.  And I think we got the audio.  Well, all right, you know what, I'm going to try to set this up with Stupid and Stupid  to get them on stage and see what they have to say.  Oh, man.  I'll tell you, after Billy Staples, the crowd was not so...  They were so happy to see Rich Voss again.  Of course.  I've never seen a note.  It was unbelievable.  Right now, he's probably going through more razor blades than anybody I know.  I got Frenchy on the line as well. 
[03:07:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Frenchy.  How you doing, guys?  I'm on the air.  Oh, they love Frenchy.  What happened?  They love Frenchy.  He's standing up there at the bar.  There's nothing cheaper, man.  Oh, yes.  Oh, here he is.  There you go, yeah.  I ran away from those retards.  All right.  You guys, hold on a while, because we're going to set up the Zephyr, and you guys got  to introduce Laverne and Shirley to the crowd, all right?  Oh, cool, man.  Yeah, wait. 
[03:07:30]  All right, hold on, guys.  Sorry, Voss.  Hold on.  Do you see they got the biohazards?  There's a lot of signs now?  Yes.  Around the area?  Yes.  It's pretty sick over there.  It's disgusting.  Just for you, Barry.  Just for me?  There you go, Barry.  We didn't disappoint once again, right?  I have another entry for my diary.  All right.  When are you going to see?  This is unbelievable.  This is memorable stuff.  Where else are you going to see live action like that?  I can tell you nowhere.  I have never seen live action like that.  That's live action that you're seeing right there in front of me.  I can't believe I'm not in here every day.  People pay your money to see that, man.  People actually do.  I'm one of them. 
[03:08:00]  They pay money.  You can't see shows like that pretty much anywhere in the country.  You've got to go to Taiwan.  Not without a terrific mirror, and several of them.  We had the showstopper before 7, Ann.  We never had the showstopper before 7.  Barry, how about a new TV series, Celebrity Banging on Fox?  Nice.  How about that?  You set up two celebs, and they just go at each other.  And maybe they could be blind, too.  Blind celebrity banging.  You wouldn't even know what they were banging. 
[03:08:30]  You don't know who you're getting.  You could put tomatoes down there, and they're going at it.  Hey, Linda, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to tell you how funny it was when you guys were staining.  Well, not you guys, but they were staining the carpet.  Yeah.  I was on the tap of the bridge going through the toll booth, and I can tell every toll  booth operator was listening to this radio station, and I was cracking up.  Oh, right on.  We love the toll booth.  And also, though, I just want to tell you, you guys are screaming and all skeeved out.  Yeah.  You want us girls to ingest that.  And be happy about it. 
[03:09:00]  Well, I don't want to describe what I was skeeved at.  Well, that was the least of my problems as far as the situation goes.  I'm sure that added to it.  By the way, this is Barry, and that wasn't me.  That wasn't me.  I was not turning off.  Barry's going to be a father soon.  He can't be involved with things like this.  That's the good stuff.  All right, Linda.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  She enjoyed it.  You've got a player, though.  You don't want to turn her off. 
[03:09:30]  Anyone else, Anthony, on formerchildstar.net?  You had the one good one where the kid died on the same bridge as mom did or something.  This is Bobby Buntrock.  Bobby Buntrock.  Bobby Buntrock.  And what do we know him from?  He was Harold Baxter and Hazel.  Oh, and Hazel.  And, you know, look at Barry Williams is here doing very well.  You could be Bobby Buntrock, who died in a car accident, which occurred on the same bridge  that his mother had been killed on in a similar crash a year earlier. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, that's spooky.  That is very strange.  Brandon Call was J.T. Lambert in Step by Step and on Baywatch.  And last seen getting shot during an attempted robbery in 1996.  There you go.  That's a child star gone bad.  Have you ever been shot during a robbery?  I don't recall that I've ever been shot during a robbery.  During a robbery, no.  During a robbery.  In fact, I don't recall being shot at all. 
[03:10:30]  You almost got shot in here.  I saw some shots being fired.  Jump back.  There was definitely a shot being fired in here.  It was back into the...  Right at the end there, I think the carpet moaned.  Oh, God.  Has the stain at least been cleaned up as well as it could be?  No, no.  It's jelling.  Or like just sitting?  Just throw some paper towels down and move on.  Wait until it turns into mashed potato flakes.  Oh, God.  Oh, man. 
[03:11:00]  I can't go back to my rubber boots coming in here again.  Yes, you do.  You thought it was safe with the new carpet.  Oh, Lord.  Of course not.  All right.

This message is for all the switchers out there.  All the people who have switched from regular beer to a light in order to save some calories.  Now, some of you made the smart choice and switched to Amstel Light.  You folks are hunky-dory. 
[03:15:00]  You can crack open an Amstel Light and enjoy its real beer taste.  Others of you switched to a bland, generic, beer-like substance.  You're the folks who are now singing the lament of the light beer drinker.  Where, oh where, has the taste of my beer gone?  Well, buck up, people.  Come on, you just picked the wrong light beer.  If you'd switched to Amstel Light, you'd be singing a different tune.  You see, Amstel Light has the least calories of any light beer while remaining one of the tastiest lagers on the planet.  It's like having your cake and drinking it, too.  So all you switchers out there, try switching from your bland light beer to the great taste of Amstel Light, 
[03:15:30]  and you, too, can sing, oh, by Jingle, Amstel Light is full of great taste.  Of course, you can make up your own song.  That's the one I like to sing.  Always satisfying, never watered down, Amstel Light.  The beer drinkers like beer.  Imported by Amstel USA, White Plains, New York.  Getting all slap-happy, it's Adam and Dave from Tweeter.

[03:20:30]  this Wednesday, August 14th, starting at 3 p.m.  Rich Voss Live.  Octane performing live on stage.  A Philly WOW bikini contest.  And Bud specials all night long.  Who knows what'll happen?  Hey, it's the Retard of Laverne and Shirley, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on  94 WISP.  It's Whip them out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:21:00]  Let's not take that for granted, right, Anthony?  Right.  WOW season's going to be over before we know it.  I want to thank all the ladies that participated once again in WOW.  I think everyone knows what that is by now.  Ladies, if you see a car with a WOW on it, that person's hoping you'd flash them on the  way home from work today.  All right.  All right.  Barry Williams in the studio.  Our new carpet has been christened.  Thanks to Barry.  I think Barry was the deciding factor today. 
[03:21:30]  I like to think I was sort of inspirational on that one.  Barry gave away a trip to Las Vegas.  Free trip to Las Vegas, including transportation.  Brett and Ann.  In fact, let me make that very quick.  A couple of people have called about this number, and I want everyone to understand exactly  what the deal is.  I don't want any misleading or any of this.  This is a really good deal.  You've got to get yourself there.  The three places you can go, Las Vegas, Nassau, and Hilton Head.  They're two different numbers.  So if you want to get on this, you've got to write it down and go.  It's four days, three nights.  It's Club de Soleil, which is a five-star vacation ownership company. 
[03:22:00]  They allow me to give away these free trips, which is really, really cool.  And it's their way of thanking you for checking out their resort.  You want to go to Vegas?  Here's the number.  Give them a call.  You have up to a year to make the reservation.  It's 877-22-VEGAS.  877-22-VEGAS.  Go.  Have a great time.  The accommodations are all free.  And if you want to go to Nassau or Hilton Head, 877-9.  This is silly.  Hang with me. 
[03:22:30]  Fun Sun.  877-9.  I don't even know what the numbers are, but it's Fun Sun.  And you're off to Nassau and Hilton Head.  It's a good deal for the accommodations.  You've got to get yourself there.  Ha, ha.  Well, what can you do?  Although I have checked it out, it's a good deal.  If you're up for it and you'd like to take a little trip, it's a free trip.  How about that?  There we go.  Very good.  But thank you, Barry, for helping us out with that couple.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that was a lot of work for me, Obi.  You know, next time I'm going to demand a little payment on that one. 
[03:23:00]  All right.  We're going to try to...  This is better than Disney World, man.  We're going to try to go to Philly now, Anthony.  Run!  Frenchie!  Hold on!  No, no, no, no!  No, no, no, no!  Frenchie!  Wait, wait, wait, wait!  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I knew we'd have problems.  What happened?  The other one's some shorter one.  Sorry.  I'm sending back that young woman.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Frenchie!  God damn Frenchie.  Yeah.  Is Voss on stage?  Yeah, he is.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they say, oh, my God, you suck. 
[03:23:30]  Then I say, I suck.  All right.  Hold on.  Are you on right now?  Why is someone talking?  He's on.  He's on.  He's on.  He's on.  Tell me if we're on.  That's your son.  All you have to do is tell me we're on the air.  We're on the air now.  One, two.  That should be coming up the right side now.  All right.  Oh, smart.  Do you hear it?  All right.  One, two?  No, it's not.  All right.  All right.  Mr. Engineer, man, we got you a lot.  Oh, my God.  I want a complete cluster F.  All right.  God damn, man.  All right, Frenchy.  Yeah. 
[03:24:00]  And you can't hear anything.  Why can't we hear Voss on stage in Philly?  Well, he's on stage right now.  We hear an engineer testing things going, hi.  Okay.  You hear it on the left?  You hear it on the left?  One second.  Hold on.  I'll tell him right now.  Hey, Voss.  What?  They can't hear you.  The engineer is looking for something.  No.  Is that my fault?  No, it's not.  It's not my fault.  No.  All I can do is be up here and do what I'm supposed to do.  That's right. 
[03:24:30]  What engineer, over at NW in New York or here in Philly?  Where is it?  In Philly or here?  I know.  I'm in Philly or New York City?  It doesn't sound like Voss's mic is on as far as the radio goes.  Okay.  They said that the mic doesn't seem to be on.  He's totally screwing it up in the translation.  All right.  Can you hear him?  All right.  We are talking to the engineer now.  Oh, my God.  They're talking to the engineer right now. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, okay.  He's going on real well in 20 minutes.  He is so bad.  All right.  If the engineer can hear me, we can hear Voss's mic on the air.  Holy Jesus Christ, man.  What a goddamn retarded day is this, man.  Hey, Barry, this is professional radio at its best.  Yeah, I'm sure it is.  The guy's just like, yes, check.  You hear it on the left.  All right.  Two.  Listen to him.  Two.  Hold on, Rick. 
[03:25:30]  What's the problem?  It's not YSP's fault.  It's not our fault.  It's the venue.  The guy who's running the board at the venue, I guess, disappeared or doesn't realize Voss is on stage.  So it doesn't have his volume up.  So we can pick that up.  Oh, what an idiot.  Frenchy.  Yes.  You got to find the guy that's working the board at the venue.  Duh.  You want me to talk to the guy on the board?  You have to find the guy that runs the board.  Okay, hold on.  I can't hear you. 
[03:26:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Frenchy.  Frenchy.  Yes.  Even better.  Tell Voss, because he's got a microphone and it's working in the venue.  Holy hell, man.  Tell Voss that his mic needs to be turned on by the guy running the board.  Okay, all right.  Hey, hold on.  Are you the guy on the board right now?  Now, where's the board?  It's the board right over there, but I'm on the right thing.  Holy hell, man.  What are they asking me to do this ass for, man? 
[03:26:30]  I'm on the radio.  Shut up, you two.  Oh, no.  God damn French.  I'm running away like a...  And Frenchy means it.  He has a slingshot.  Wait, there's an asking board, man.  I can't find the board.  Frenchy.  Where's the guy that's in the board?  Where's the board?  Yes.  Let me check it out, you faggot. 
[03:27:00]  Who am I supposed to see with?  I just don't know, man.  They have a problem.  They can't hear him.  Frenchy.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that on our end?  Frenchy.  Frenchy.  There he is.  All right.  You found him?  Hold on.  I'll give you the engine here, all right?  All right.  All right.  Hey, man.  Hey, bro.  Hey.  They don't have a split coming out of my console.  That's why you're not hearing them on the air.  Well, we just had it somewhere. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, really?  We heard, I guess we heard someone checking left side, right side.  That wasn't me.  Well, who's on our Zephyr?  Please stink.  This is awful.  We can never do anything cool.  Yeah.  We wanted to, like, be able to pot it up and listen to Voss introduce those two mules on stage.  Hey, guys.  They said two more minutes.  They said.  What?  Two more minutes.  They said two more minutes.  All right.  All right.  Two more minutes.  This is like bumper cars at Coney Island. 
[03:28:00]  They're just waiting a train wreck after another.  Frenchie, stay in the line.  Ben's going to talk to you.  Yeah.  Ben, let us know when it's working.  Make sure they are.  Yeah, turn off the Zephyr.  Ben, make sure he's conscious of what a cue means.  It doesn't mean right when we pick up the phone, he goes.  That was so funny.  It's like, hey, Frenchie, Voss, you on?  No, you idiot.  We want to talk to you and then tell you to cue him at the appropriate time.  Click, click.  Voss, you on?  We're embarrassed, Barry.  I'm sorry you had to watch this. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, that's okay.  That's okay.  I'm just trying to make sense out of it all.  We are professional broadcasters.  I know that you are.  I know that you are.  That was the biggest example of unprofessionalism.  That's why we try not to do anything.  Right.  It's better if we handle everything ourselves.  Every time I come in, I always feel like I stay that one extra segment.  You know?  Right?  You're robbed.  We feel the same way, Barry.  It goes great, and then we get out there, and then we just keep going for it.  We get so, so greedy.  Barry, if you need to, take your Malibu rum and get the hell out of here. 
[03:29:00]  The only reason I'm here is because I'm still drinking the Malibu rum.  Right.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  We had such a great idea today.  We sent the Retard Laverne Shirley down to Philly.  They're doing a WOW FanFest thing, a chemistry, Octane's playing, and Rich Voss is hosting,  and Frenchie's there.  Right.  So we want to take a little peek, see what's going on.  And I want to peek with you.  We have a Zephyr, a microphone.  We want to go live on stage with Rich Voss.  He would mess with the crowd a little bit.  Intro Frenchie and intro Laverne Shirley. 
[03:29:30]  The reaction these people are going to get would be unbelievable.  And good radio.  We can't get it going.  Doing it would be a lot more fun than describing it, wouldn't it?  Yeah, but for some reason, all the technology is in place, but when we try to use it, we're  like the coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons.  It always blows up in our face.  The sound thing always drives me crazy, too.  What is it?  It's just knobs and stuff.  You just turn them and push them and dial the plugs.  That's it.  The engineer, coming out of the left channel.  Left channel.  One, two, three.  That's what we want to hear. 
[03:30:00]  Frenchie's like, Voss, you're on.  Voss, you're on.  The second he picked up the phone.  Hi, Frenchie.  Voss, go.  Well, while we're waiting, who's going to be on Fear Factor next month?  You are?  That would be me.  Yes, that would be me.  On September 23rd, Fear Factor.  What kind of stuff do you know?  Obviously, I'm a whore for the celebrity television shows.  You certainly are.  I can't keep up with your points today, Barry.  I jumped ship here.  I'm going to NBC now, away from Fox for Fear Factor.  And do you know what you're going to be doing?  I did.  We've already filmed it. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, okay.  Here's the great thing about doing the celebrity Fear Factor.  I told him, I said, I'm not eating anything weird.  If it belongs in the ground or it crawls, it's not running through my digestive tract.  Yeah.  If it's a pig rectum, it should stay in his ass.  Right.  Because that's what they have you eating, that kind of stuff.  So we just did events.  Big trucks.  You know, monster trucks.  Yeah.  Big foot.  You know, we had him bearing down on us while we're trapped in a car, all cinched in, finding  the right key to start the last car in the row to get out of the way before we get run  over.  Wow. 
[03:31:00]  That was good.  Now, what would happen if Barry Williams gets crushed in it?  Well, you had a cage around you, but a lot of people did get run over.  Yeah.  The car, the back of the roof, it's like inside the back seat.  It's like a little scary to be in there while the thing runs you over.  And then there's another one where we're all swimming with a thousand snakes, including  a 15-foot albino.  I figured that out, though.  They drug the animals.  No, they don't.  How do they drug a thousand snakes?  Did you see the alligator thing?  No.  Where they jumped into the tank with the alligators?  And the alligators were barely moving?  I want to know how they pulled that one off.  They feed them. 
[03:31:30]  It's like the snakes.  They either feed them or they made the water really cold so the alligators didn't really  feel like moving.  But something was going on there.  That's possible.  I want to see real alligators hungry in warm water.  Here's the deal with the snakes.  Now, what they tell you is that they're all non-poisonous, which is for sure, right?  I mean, they don't want to kill people.  They just want to be scary.  They want you to confront your fears.  But then they take like a 10-by-10 plexiglass thing that's about 12 feet deep, and they  put a thousand snakes, all different kinds of snakes.  A little gardener's snake, some of them, some orange snakes, and I think this 15-foot 
[03:32:00]  albino boa.  But the thing is, they're not water snakes, so they're pissed.  The snakes are all pissed when you get it.  And then you've got to dive through them and back up through them and like that, and so  that was kind of a trip.  And the other one was getting suspended 800 feet in the ground by a crane over a dam,  and then the bottom of the box opens up, and the bungee jump another 120 feet.  And you did that?  Oh, yeah.  All right, hold on.  Oh, yeah.  Frenchie!  Here we go.  Frenchie, there she is.  All right.  I think we got the retarded of her and Shirley. 
[03:32:30]  Yes, they do.  Who says?  Let me tell you something.  Kiss my ass, buddy.  Nice buzz.  Let me get off this way.  Okay, so it's working.  Go jump in a lake.  We can't hear the crowd, but they're obviously heckling.  I know, I hear it.  Excited out I will right now.  I'm looking in your big blue box.  How about you stop talking, Mr. Engineer Guy?  I want to see what's in your pants, because you probably ain't got nothing.  Can you hear those two retards?  Yeah, they're fighting with the crowd there, Frenchie. 
[03:33:00]  Well, pretty much so.  Hey, Ovi, I'm going to make this scarier.  Yeah, and the people are looking at them like a bunch of fish in a...  What do you want to say?  ... and a fish tank.  Yeah?  Hey, Frenchie, go on.  What's that?  Frenchie.  Too hot for you?  Why?  Yeah.  Anybody?  No, make me shut up, baby.  Come on, let's go.  Come on, let's go.  Why is that guy still talking?  Why is the guy at the board mic'd and talking? 
[03:33:30]  Frenchie.  Frenchie.  Hey, you're not retarded.  You're wanting to know one.  Go.  What is it?  Frenchie.  Yeah.  Frenchie, go up to the guy at the board and punch him in the head.  Okay, I'm going to go right now.  I'm punching him in the head.  Why is the guy talking?  Open up your mouth.  How is the crowd doing out there anyway?  God, give us a cheer.  Hold on.  Hey, what'd you do to your hair?  Come on, I can't do it.  Keep going.  You got to be done.  I can't do it.  I can't do it with your hair.  Check, check.  Left channel.  How are you going?

Who would touch you?  How mad do you...  Everywhere you try, you try to pick up women.  Everywhere I go, I try to pick up women.  I do.  You're right.  I try to pick up women everywhere I go.  It's a numbers game.  All right?  And I would.  I would step over you to do it.  They diss me.  Listen to me.  Beat it, both of you.  Now go wait in the car. 
[03:37:00]  Go wait in the limo.  We've got to introduce the band.  We've got to introduce the band.  We've got the bouncers here.  All right?  Say a thank you.  Say thank you to everybody.

So it's getting nice.  And they were heckling the retarded Laverne Shirley?  Oh, my God.  You have no idea. 
[03:38:30]  Everybody was bitching them.  Really?  Everybody.  I mean, they're practicing retards.  I mean, you know, it doesn't take one or two to figure it out.  Right.  Okay.  People are recognizing them just by looking at them.  They didn't even have to open their stupid mouth.  They just look at them.  They say, oh, it's got to be them.  They've been retarded.  There you go.  I say, hey, how did you know?  Oh, there they are.  Holy Jesus Christ.  They found me.  They found me.  Holy Jesus.  Yeah, you hear that? 
[03:39:00]  Can you hear this?  Please let me around.  That's why he's being attacked.  Holy hell.  They're chasing me, guys.  They're chasing me like I'm a lamb in the wilderness.  He's running.  To leave you alone.  Check, check.  Holy Jesus Christ.  All right, Frenchy.  We're going to watch it all.  All right, guys.  I took two later, guys.  All right.

What, me?  Yeah.  No, my mic's off. 
[03:39:30]  Was he doing it the whole time?  I don't know.  You got me bad.  That was a good one.  That sound like anything after we figured it out?  I have no idea.  Boss had some really funny lines, though.  That's all I know.  Anytime he's slamming those two mutants, I'm laughing.  Like a slinky down the steps.  You know, don't hurt yourself.  Look at you.  All right, well.  Looks like it's going well in Philly.  That's, yeah, sounded like a fun time.  Barry, I think we're going to let you go. 
[03:40:00]  So you could leave with some dignity.  A little dignity before we end our program.  Oh, no, it's too late.  It's too late.  I stayed the extra segment.  You got me to the end now.

From Ron and Fez getting ready to get their show going right after us here in New York City.  I told them, don't step in the taped-off area with the biohazard signs.  And the two napkins that are right in the middle of that little compound.

[03:49:30]  Yes.  What a cluster effing Philly.  We stink.  Well, we tried.  We like trying to do all this complicated stuff, but we can't figure it out.  The technology's there to speak with astronauts on the shuttle.  They could just push down a button and go, hello?  And the astronauts go, hey, yeah, we're still up here.  But we tried to listen to a couple of retards on stage in Philly and nothing was working.  Exactly.  Let's go to Jared and play What Did We Learn? 
[03:50:00]  What's up, Jared?  Guys, what's going on?  Just quickly before I start, tell Ronnie to tell Fez to stay away from that spot tonight,  will you?  Oh, God.  Mmm, salsa.  Hey, ranch staff.  Go ahead, Jared.  What did you learn today?  Two things.  Pete Johnson did not use a chin dildo to install the carpet at WNEW.  No.  Very good.  And Opie Letta scored 35 points on the high school. 
[03:50:30]  That's Brewer's Bit.  Yep.  You guys can't steal Brewer's Bit.  Wow, I didn't learn this.  How did this get past us?  Chris, what did you learn?  Hey, guys, I had kind of an independent what-it by Robert Reed.  He was not.  Hi, guys.  I'm going to go investigate David Berkowitz's role in the Oklahoma City bombing.  Later.  That never happened.  Never happened.  All right. 
[03:51:00]  He'll get you thinking, that guy.  That's a real fear factor, being a young, attractive boy in Hollywood.  Around Robert Reed.  In Hollywood.  That's a fear factor, if you ask me.  Talk about dangerous snakes.  Forget it.  I survived.  Yeah.  Talk about eating poisonous things.  Maybe I wasn't attractive enough.  That's a good thing.  Wow.  Barry.  What did I learn?  What did I learn? 
[03:51:30]  You know, what I learned is...  Did you learn something, Barry?  I did.  Yeah.  That a carpet...  A carpet is like a new car.  Yeah.  A new one can turn to a used one in one afternoon.  Evil he used.  Yes.  We should get the couple in again, because they got a trip to Vegas for christening our carpet  tonight.  That has happened.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah.  How you doing?  I learned two things.  That Barry Williams is much more entertaining in the afternoon.  Oh, boy.  And Barry?  Yes.  Oh, he got you.  Oh, he got you.  He knew who he was going to be. 
[03:52:00]  He clicked, yeah.  They go, oh, Barry, and then he'll hang up after you say yes.  I see.  That's called getting you.  Let's see what Jesse learned.  What's up, Jesse?  Hey.  Hey.  I learned Lady Di is not just a name.  It's a command.  Yes.  It should be.  Always.  All right.  We got Brett and Ann back in the studio.  There they are.  The stars of the show.  And I hope you two have learned something.  Yes.  If I visit, they will come.  Yes.  Yes.  That is so true, Barry.  You attract this stuff.  I do.  You really do.  Well, I must say, without any pun, bang up job, Brent and Ann, they were on the fence. 
[03:52:30]  They just told me a minute ago.  They were on the fence about even coming in, right, Brent, Ann?  I heard Barry was going to be here.  That actually was the deciding factor.  How often?  Do you guys realize you have a story for your grandkids?  Absolutely.  Well, we had...  The deciding factor.  We had you-know-what in front of Barry Williams.  It doesn't get much better than that.  Did you ever...  Now, you...  Suddenly, I want to be Greg Brady again.  Yeah.  Of course, you've watched the Brady Bunch, right?  We have.  Did you ever think you'd do that in front of Greg Brady himself, Barry Williams? 
[03:53:00]  You hope and dream.  It would have been nicer in front of Marsha, right?  He calls himself Peter.  Oh!  There you go.  We saw...  Yeah, we had Greg and Peter in the studio today.  Yeah.  You know, it's just so nice I can reward them this way.  That's what I feel really, really good about.  Send them off to Vegas for a week.  That's great.  You could use it.  How nice is that?  And it looked like...  When do you want to go?  When do you want to go?  We were thinking around the holidays. 
[03:53:30]  Around, like, Thanksgiving, November, or December.  Very nice.  It's very nice out there.  It looks like she had your head in a leg lock, too, there, Barry.  Oh, that's true.  How was that?  When you were sporting that afro on the show.  When you were sporting the Brady afro, it looked like...  It was spur of the moment.  You didn't have time to touch up.  That hairstyle of mine was very subliminal.  I worked that out.  It did.  It actually looked like your head from the 70s with a hatchet wound.  A little bald spot down the middle.  It was like a little natural, as they call it. 
[03:54:00]  A little.  There's no problem with that.  There's absolutely no problem with that.  My God.  A lot of guys find that attractive.  That's fine.  Well, guys, enjoy New York and enjoy Vegas.  I'm Barry Williams.  Absolutely.  And we might see you tomorrow for Sex for Sam 3.  There you go.  Tomorrow's going to be an unbelievable show.  Today was great, but tomorrow...  Barry, I'm sorry.  But tomorrow's going to be really good.  Today was great.  Tomorrow, what you saw today...  You know what?  I might be able to come back.  You might be able to come back in. 
[03:54:30]  That's what I want to hear.  That's exactly what we want to hear.  Before I run down to no idea tomorrow night at 6.30, I'll come back in for a little more  sex shop.  You might as well.  We got Tracy Morgan coming in tomorrow, too.  Nice.  Tracy Morgan.  Very funny guy.  Very nice.  And what they did on this carpet is going to happen all over New York City tomorrow at various  locations by multiple couples.  And they will be doing that all over New York City for points.  And then whoever gets the most points, whatever couple gets the most points, gets to join  us in Boston at the Sam Adams Brewery. 
[03:55:00]  On every carpet, may you have a microphone that works.  Yeah.  That is my wish for you.  Please.  Cluster F.  That was great.  That's what you expect from this show, though, unfortunately.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Today I learned that Opie lines up a taint like Tiger Woods lines up a putt.  Yes.  I also learned that Fez will be taste testing the biohazard area in the studio later.  Hey!  Hey!  All right. 
[03:55:30]  Anyone have any Pringles?  I'm going to dip.  Jersey Gary, he learned today there was a star-studded event in Philly today that had  neither a star nor a stud.  And Chris from Boston, hey, guys, today I learned that Opie's High School had fake  black kids, and you also learned that Bruce, b-b-b-b-b-boys, Mittman, still has his bar  mitzvah money.  Still has that bar mitzvah money, boo.  And I think that's about it, unfortunately.  That's about it for today.  Frenchy, any final thoughts? 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, I want to kill myself, my guys.  That's all I want to do.  I'll have to be right back with those two twats tonight.  Frenchy, how are you getting back?  You taking the limo?  I have Uncle John coming and pick me up, thank God, my friends, thank God.  Yeah, Uncle John, faithful listener to the show, went down to pick up Frenchy.  Yeah, he's going to call and pick me up right now, that son of a bitch.  The ride back would be even worse, because even drunker, they've been drinking and just  ugh.  I think Lady Di's going to stay here the whole night because she's so effed up right now. 
[03:56:30]  Really?  She's drunk out of her ass.  Drunk out of her ass.  She's talking through her ass right now.  Oh, talking.  Yeah, yeah, I tried to come by.  I have to bring the nice tape that I taped today on the way in here.  Oh, that's right, Ed.  That's priceless stuff, man.  We got audio from the limo.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Nice stuff.  Guys, I'll see you tomorrow anyway, all right?  Bonjour, salope.  All right, see you tomorrow.  Poufias.  Poufias.  I think it is.  Bye-bye. 
[03:57:00]  All right.  Chimwa.  We've got to get it off the air.  Ben's freaking Barry Williams.  It's always a pleasure.  Pass me on a little Malibu room over there.  Oh, yeah.  Keeping it down there.  Isn't that great?  That's lovely.  Thank you.  Thank you for bringing them there on.  A little essence of coconuts.  Yes.  All right.  We've got to get out of here.
