<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the show's controversial nature and the perceived double standard applied to radio regarding "niceness."  The intro music, featuring an inexplicably edited anecdote about nose-picking, played, followed by a brief, nonsensical introduction of guest Leslie Nielsen.  The hosts then previewed their upcoming interview with Jesse Ventura, focusing on Ventura's controversial 9/11 conspiracy theories, expressing their skepticism and anticipating a heated debate.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to this debate with Ventura.  Audio clips from another show were played, showcasing Ventura questioning the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7.  Opie and Anthony countered Ventura's arguments with humorous and sarcastic retorts, using comparisons to cartoons and billiards. The discussion became increasingly mocking and cynical, focusing on Ventura's perceived lack of understanding of physics and structural engineering.  A caller who worked with explosives offered his perspective on the 9/11 building collapses, comparing them to controlled demolitions.

The conversation then shifted to New York City traffic, utilizing racial slurs to describe certain drivers. This led to a discussion of Opie's "sports curse," detailing a listener's claim that Opie's prediction about a college basketball game cost them money. The hosts also discussed upcoming interviews with Bob Kelly and Jesse Ventura, the closing of Shea and Yankee Stadiums (with much sarcasm and profanity), and criticized a fake commercial featuring Opie and Roseanne Barr.  The Olympic Torch relay and subsequent protests were discussed, transitioning into a broader discussion about China's human rights record and perceived hypocrisy in American foreign policy.  The hosts expressed apathy towards the China/Tibet conflict but outrage over human rights violations.  Further commentary on the upcoming presidential election and Condoleezza Rice concluded this section, followed by a discussion of the movie "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" and its marketing.

The show continued with a discussion about New York City corruption and mismanagement, specifically citing the misallocation of $354 million in federal transit funds. This transitioned into a humorous discussion about the dangers of falling construction cranes.  A call-in segment followed, with questions ranging from a woman scrubbing a toilet to Alex Jones' radio voice, leading to a discussion about creating a "Radio Voice Hall of Fame."  In-studio guest Bob Kelly, promoting his CD/DVD "Just a Tip," was featured, with the discussion interwoven with bathroom humor related to Jimmy's digestive issues. The hosts also promoted their ONA Animation Festival, expressing concern over low ticket sales.

The latter part of this segment focused on Dick Vitale's emotional Hall of Fame speech and other athletes' tearful farewells, featuring audio clips and humorous commentary. Jesse Ventura then joined the show, and a significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to his views on the Iraq War and 9/11 conspiracy theories.  Ventura's book, "Don't Start the Revolution Without Me," was heavily promoted, along with his upcoming book signings.  Ventura discussed inconsistencies in the official 9/11 narrative, citing molten metal and powdered cement as evidence of foul play, and challenged the failure of US air defenses. The Gulf of Tonkin incident and Iran-Contra affair were also mentioned, along with discussions about the trustworthiness of the US government.  The Payne Stewart plane crash was used as a comparison point.  The conversation was frequently interrupted with sarcastic remarks and personal jabs.

Another segment heavily featured 9/11 conspiracy theories, with listeners calling in to offer alternative explanations involving pre-planted explosives. A caller claiming to be a former fireman provided details about fire's effects on steel structures. The conversation also touched on the location of the black boxes and Muhammad Atta's passport.  A significant portion focused on Anthony's recent acquisition of a pistol permit and his decision to carry a firearm, sparking a debate about gun ownership, self-defense, and potential drawbacks.  Various firearm types and Anthony's preferences were discussed, along with humorous scenarios involving home invasions.  Jesse Ventura's opinions were frequently debated, and the sales of Bob Kelly's comedy CD were discussed using Amazon sales figures.  Numerous listener calls, often inflammatory, punctuated this segment.

The final segment began with a discussion on home security, comparing alarm systems to personal defense with firearms, and veered into humorous, crude tangents about hiring security.  A caller, Joe, discussed gun ownership and wine consumption.  The conversation then shifted to a news story about a woman selling "I was raped" t-shirts, sparking a debate about the appropriateness of the message.  This was followed by speculation about Jimmy's upcoming couples therapy session, with crude jokes and personal experiences shared.  The final portion involved further discussion of Bob Kelly's CD, interspersed with off-color humor and banter, including a discussion of a disgusting YouTube video showing the hosts’ “tongue scraping” of a guest. The segment concluded with the "Line of the Day" announcement, discussion of AshleyMadison.com, and a song about kicking a woman "in the cunt."  The show ended with a self-deprecating discussion of their shock-jock persona, declaring themselves "artists."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  The controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  The talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Let's welcome Leslie Nielsen to the Opie and Anthony show.  How do you do? I didn't know where you'd done.  Did you play drunk or stroke?  Okay, so Opie and Anthony.  The first time you picked a girl's nose, what happened?  Her parents come home, so we break it all up. 
[00:01:00]  You know, my first time ever.  And the dog runs over, and he's just licking, licking, licking my finger.  This is where entertainment is going.  You're Chris Hansen.  I am.  Have you seen the show?  I thought you were real funny on O.P. and Anthony.  Oh, you listen to me on O.P. and Anthony?  Wow.  That's a plug you don't really want.  Unbelievable.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, my God. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hi.  First little problem of the day.  The intro that was just played.  The picking nose thing doesn't make sense without the setup.  Steve.  Yes.  Jeff Ross had a brilliant way of describing  what you do when you're a bit younger 
[00:02:00]  and you're with the opposite sex.  What bass is that?  Third?  Something like that.  I think that's third bass.  Yeah.  Instead of being graphic about it,  he used the analogy of the nose.  Right.  Like picking a nose.  And we explained all that  before he went into the nose thing.  Steve chops all the explanation out  because he wants a quick little clip for the intro.  Yes.  And now it's about nose picking.  So the people out there think that... 
[00:02:30]  It's just about nose picking.  Yeah, exactly.  It's not as funny.  No.  Whatever.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Got the onaradio.com.  We got Jesse Ventura coming in today  who believes that, what,  the government took down the Twin Towers,  we're learning?  Yeah, apparently he's of that mindset  that it was a controlled explosion.  Blah, blah, blah.  We'll have to see what his side is.  Well, we don't have to study  for our Jesse Ventura interview today. 
[00:03:00]  No, that's for sure.  It's going to be a bit heated.  I heard him...  Let's start building our wall between us  and the interview.  Yeah.  I heard him on Larry King,  I don't know, maybe a week ago,  and he sounded quite reasonable  about a lot of political things,  about George Bush and the candidates  and Hillary and Obama.  Sounded reasonable.  But then you come out with something like that,  oh my God, 
[00:03:30]  it just kind of takes your credibility  and flushes it down the turlet,  as my grandma used to call it.  The turlet.  I have to go to the turlet.  But quickly, I just want to say,  there are some ethnic backgrounds  that honestly...  What?  I'm not going to mention it.  What?  That honestly can't drive.  It just...  There is this stereotype  of certain ethnic backgrounds  over the years  that they've said that they can't drive. 
[00:04:00]  They can't!  Holy mother of Jesus Christ!  Mother of Jesus...  Oh yeah, that makes sense, actually.  I can't take it.  What happens?  You get behind people  that do two miles an hour  through the goddamn Midtown Tunnel.  Isn't there a few lanes to pick from?  Yeah.  It's a 50-50 shot.  It's one of those...  It's like the labyrinth.  You pick the wrong one,  you're done.  Wait, you can't move over  to the other lane? 
[00:04:30]  No, there's ka-chunk-a-chunkers  in between the lanes.  There's big, like, things...  Believe me, in the old days, too,  when I had my mountaineer  and it was at the end of the lease,  ooh, I'd go right over those things.  Bop!  They're about, you know,  four feet tall.  They put a barrier up,  but they're made of plastic.  Yeah, those are just  slalom fences, though.  Yeah, they put marks  on your bumpers, though.  Oh, okay.  You can knock those down nice.  Yeah, once the end of the lease comes,  then I pay no attention  to those things.  But, you know,  I can't quite do that now.  So I was behind this minivan, 
[00:05:00]  and it's doing,  I swear to you,  10 miles an hour.  And the speed limit  through the tunnel is 25,  and everyone does 40, at least.  But they're just not moving,  and I'm right on the bumper,  right on it.  So we come out of the tunnel,  and I hammer the gas,  get around them,  and I gotta take the look.  I gotta turn my head  and take the look.  And when I look and see,  the racial epithets  that run out of my mouth  like diarrhea. 
[00:05:30]  And I just go,  well, that figures.  I'm by myself, too.  Aren't you beeping  and flashing your high beams  and doing all that?  They don't pay attention.  So I'm right on their ass.  I got a friggin' tank.  So you got a pistol permit?  That could have been  your first victim.  I can't carry in the city.  Oh, you don't have that yet.  That could have been  your first victim.  Could have been.  Why not?  Oh, was that annoying?  And then I pull around,  and they don't even give me  the courtesy  of looking over at me 
[00:06:00]  so that they know  that I was pissed at them.  They gotta sit there  and just look straight ahead  with that dumb look  on their face.  And it's just known  throughout the years  that these people  cannot drive.  And I wish I could say it,  but you know  what I'm talking about.  You just know.  Male or female?  You could blindfold these people  with dental floss.  As Dice used to say. 
[00:06:30]  So you could do it in character.  Or you used to be able to.  Males?  Females?  It was a guy driving  with his foot-bound woman  next to him.  Of course it was a guy driving.  No broads are up this early  going to work.  That's right,  and they're not allowed  to drive, I think.  This is the man's...  Sit home and cook.  This is the man's time of day.  All the men going to work.  So that just, I mean,  oh, that blows.  Really got me going this morning. 
[00:07:00]  That blows.  And I want to say  hi to Keith in New York City  right off the bat.  Thank you, Opie.  Your sports curse lives.  Oh.  I can't even like,  I can't even do this.  The NCAA, right,  last night?  Yeah.  And someone said,  who do you want?  Oh, right.  And I said,  ah, I didn't really,  I love college basketball,  but I gotta be honest,  I kind of took a year off.  I don't really,  I didn't really follow it  that closely this year.  That's right.  So I just kind of  threw a team out there,  and people took that  very seriously,  including Keith.  There's a few of these. 
[00:07:30]  That happens when you do that,  too,  when you don't think about it  and nobody really gives you,  like,  oh, watch out for his sports curse.  Oh, because  it kind of builds it up  a little bit,  but when you just  blurt out a team like that,  trouble.  Too long to explain  to the newbies,  but I can tell you this much,  I do have a sports curse,  and I was rooting for the Pats  all year long,  and we all know what happened  with that one.  That's just one of many,  many things  that have happened to me  with this sports curse.  Anyway,  yesterday I just threw a team  out there  when Colin Quinn was in,  and Keith M. from New York City 
[00:08:00]  writes,  thank you,  Opie,  your sports curse lives,  I bet,  100 times.  That would be $500  last night  on Kansas,  plus two,  after hearing you say,  I'll take Memphis  when talking to Colin.  Memphis is up by nine  with two minutes left,  final score,  Kansas 75,  Memphis 68.  Thank you, Opie.  Thank you.  It's unbelievable,  it really is.  I just cannot pick a winner.  I know that was just  kind of throwing one out there,  but still.  Hey,  let's get back to Jesse Ventura,  so we got the audio. 
[00:08:30]  He was on another show recently.  Did he have his feather boa  on at the time?  He's looking kind of...  Ragged?  Well,  look,  look at the...  Yeah,  I saw him.  Well,  why would that scream be on?  He's looking like Scorch.  I don't know what's going on with him.  He's growing one of these  really long goatees,  I think this is the current picture,  and then he's putting  rubber bands in it.  This goatee I'm looking at  has got to be  about a foot,  close to a foot.  You know what he looks like?  He looks like  James Taylor's evil twin.  That's who he's looking like 
[00:09:00]  these days.  He looks like he knows  some karate.  Yeah.  So this is Jesse Ventura  on the Alex Jones show  last week.  First and foremost,  I think,  is the fact that  okay,  in New York City  and Manhattan,  two planes struck  two buildings.  We'll all be in agreement  on that,  I think.  But how is it  that a third building  fell five hours later?  You know,  what they call  World Trade Center  Building No. 7.  And for people  that think, 
[00:09:30]  well,  it was just a smaller building,  it was 51 stories high.  How could this building  just implode  into its own footprint  five hours later?  That's my first question.  in the 9-11 commission  never even brought it up.  They didn't devote  even one page  to that  in their big volume  of investigation.  Well,  the answer is obvious.  The government  wanted to get away  with one.  Yeah.  Can you just maybe  accept the fact  that when two  giant skyscrapers  plummet 
[00:10:00]  right next to this building  that perhaps  some damage  is going to be done  to it  and it will fall down  and that a fire  inside of it  can weaken the structure  and that there isn't  a precedent for this  that you can't look back  and go,  well,  when two  100-story towers  come tumbling down  right next to another building,  in the past 15 times  that's happened,  that other building  never fell.  But this time it did.  Wacky things happen. 
[00:10:30]  Things happen like that.  And that makes  more sense  than any other theory.  Go to the simplest thing.  That's what you gotta do.  What you gotta do first  is eliminate  the simple things.  You ever see Sling Blade?  Oh, yeah.  You ever see  when the guy's  trying to fix  the little lawnmower?  Sure.  And stupid  Sling Blade  there goes over  and goes,  it's out of gas.  Sometimes the simple answer  is the answer.  Exactly.  Sometimes the obvious answer  is just it.  It's just it. 
[00:11:00]  People don't want  to accept it.  They don't want  to believe it.  They want this big conspiracy.  They need it  in order to just survive  in this country.  They need some kind  of conspiracy.  But,  you know what?  Buildings fell down.  There's a lot of crap  flying all over the place.  Some things hit  other things  and the building  fell down hours later.  And why would  the government  need to like  knock down  another building  in that circumstance?  Yeah.  What would be  the reasoning of that?  At that point, 
[00:11:30]  you got the two  World Trade Center  towers coming down.  Oh, let's really  freak people out  and get rid of this one  no one really knows about.  Yeah, exactly.  Number two,  how could those  buildings fall  at the speed  of gravity?  Oh.  You know,  if you put a stopwatch  on them,  both of those  World Trade Center  buildings were on  the ground  in 10 seconds.  Were they?  How could that be?  If you took a billiard  ball and dropped it  from the height  of the World Trade Center  in a vacuum, 
[00:12:00]  it would hit the ground  in 9.3 seconds.  So,  I guess we were able  to push the building  down faster.  I guess so,  yeah.  What is he getting at?  I don't know,  because wouldn't it  just fall at that  speed anyway?  It was the hand of God  just pushing down  the building  as fast as he could.  Whether it just  falls down  because planes hit it  or it is a  controlled demolition,  how would it fall  faster than it  could possibly fall?  It would fall  the same way. 
[00:12:30]  You dummy.  I don't get it.  This guy really  is coming on our show  today?  Oh my God.  There is a mathematical  formula,  which I don't know what,  it's like so-and-so's  theorem,  which explains,  it's got something  to do with the rate  of why.  Somebody did explain it  because they heard  someone doing  an explanation  and they're like,  yeah,  but you don't  understand math  because you don't  know so-and-so's  theorem and they  explain exactly  what the depulsion  was and it made sense.  And then they cry  and go,  shut up!  Gatekeeper! 
[00:13:00]  Yeah,  we are the gatekeeper,  the Illuminati.  I used to like  this Jesse Ventura  too.  He was pretty  outrageous as a  politician.  Let's give him  a chance  to explain  himself.  Yeah,  well,  if you took  that same  billiard ball  and dropped  it 10 stories  at a time  and merely  stopped it  and started it,  it would take  30 seconds.  If you dropped  it every floor  of the World Trade  Center to the  ground,  simply stopping  and starting  it on gravity,  it would take  over 100 seconds 
[00:13:30]  to reach the  ground.  Amazing.  Amazing,  this idiot  doesn't even  confront him  with that  dumb theory?  First of all,  why would you  do that to  a billiard  ball?  Exactly.  And who  thinks a building  is taking  100 seconds  to fall?  I know,  it would take  the building's  falling,  people are  having lunch  and they're  walking out of it.  It's like,  we're on the  first floor,  we got plenty  of time.  He's getting  his knowledge  from cartoons  because that's  how buildings  and cartoons  fall.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  So what  is he saying,  that every  floor had  had dynamite  in it?  Yeah,  I guess.  I don't know  what he's saying.  I don't know  what he's saying.  And yet they're  telling us that,  and I could go  on now after  studying it,  the planes hit  the building,  okay,  jet fuel is  four-fifths  kerosene,  which is not  a hot burning  fuel,  and they want us  to believe that  it melted these  steel-structured  girders and 
[00:14:30]  caused these  buildings to  softened  them all  it took.  I was on  the site  within two  weeks after  it happened  and I saw  none of  these pancakes.  Wouldn't they  all be piled  up in a huge  mass on the  ground?  And yet  everything was  blown into  dust.  I'm starving,  Earl.  We got any  pancakes back  there?  He's insane.  He's insane.  He's insane.  You know how  much paper was  in those  buildings?  Have you ever  started a fire?  You could get  a fire burning  pretty hot.  Pretty hot.  And just  fooling around  with a fireplace.  The whole  melting of the 
[00:15:00]  metal thing,  is also  another fallacy.  The metal  doesn't have  to melt.  It just had  to be weakened  enough.  It had to be  soft enough.  Metal doesn't  go from this  solid to  liquid form  instantly.  When you  heat metal  up, as  everyone knows,  heat, the  molecules move  faster, the  substance gets  softer, weaker.  That's what  happened.  It didn't  take it to 
[00:15:30]  be dripping  molten metal.  It just  took it to  be a little  weaker, and  that's all it  took.  The structure  was damaged,  the beams  weakened, the  building came  down.  Simple as  that, gatekeeper.  fire.  And when you  look at it  from that  aspect, none  of it makes  any sense.  If you apply  common sense  again to  it, it  does not  make any  sense.  Never before  in the  annals of  history has  a fire  caused a  steel-structured 
[00:16:00]  building to  fall to the  ground.  There it is.  Never in the  annals of  history has a  fire caused a  steel building to  fall down.  I can't wait  to ask them  how is this  accomplished?  Yeah.  With thousands  and thousands  of workers.  That's my  argument all the  time.  We've seen so  many shows.  I've seen so  many shows on  demolitions of  buildings.  I enjoy watching  it on Discovery.  It's fun.  It's educational.  I like watching  things fall down,  especially old 
[00:16:30]  people cracking  their hips.  Right.  But how do  you get a  crew?  You know what  it takes?  They show  crews for  weeks at least  working on  buildings.  They've got to  strip it out.  They've got to  drill holes in  the cement  structures.  They've got to  plant dynamite  in there.  They've got to  run cables,  wires that  are giant,  giant cables  running out of  the building.  They've got to  put come-alongs  and springs that  pull the beams 
[00:17:00]  in towards each  other.  How do you do  this while people  are typing?  And how do  you wire it  all together to  one little  kapooey thing?  To one hitting  kablammy thing.  The plunger thing  that Wiley Coyote  pushes down  in it.  Time for the  kapooey.  I don't know  how, but the  roadrunner has  taken the dynamite  and moved it  right behind the  stupid coyote,  and he never  knows.  He hits the  plunger.  Also, the  tragic ending  of Tom from  Tom and Jerry  all the time. 
[00:17:30]  He does that  constantly,  blowing himself  up with the  plunger thingy.  Well, this is  what Ventura  thinks happened.  You've worked  with explosives.  What does it  look like to  you?  Another radio  guy.  He's worked  with explosives?  I've got to  stop our  Jesse Ventura  audio to  point out  another radio  guy.  Work with  explosives.  Another man  cow like  this sounding  guy.  Why talk in  your normal  voice?  Thank you,  Brother  Weiss.  Thank you. 
[00:18:00]  He's out of  work right now.  He's the king  of Rochester  radio.  I thank him  for teaching  me the best  lesson ever  in radio.  Simply go on  the air and  use your  regular voice.  I was a radio  guy back in the  day.  Were you?  And then  Brother Weiss  said, he  basically slapped  me one day.  La, la, la, la, la.  Well, no, that  was more character  driven crap.  But then he  slapped me and  he slapped me  and said, just  use your regular  voice and you'll  be ahead of  everybody.  Listen to this  guy. 
[00:18:30]  You've worked  with explosives.  What does it  look like to  you?  Well, upon  looking at the  film in super  slow motion and  the way the  building fell and  comparing that to  the way that they  do like a  controlled demolition  of a hotel in  Las Vegas, they  both fell  identical.  And it just is  beyond me.  And I, again, I  kicked myself for  when it initially  happened that the  light didn't go  off.  But again, I was  so shocked that 
[00:19:00]  this thing had  even taken place  that I, you  know, again, I  apologize for not  being more aware,  but I don't think  I was alone as  were most of the  people in the  United States.  Wow.  Even if they  took me into the  basement of the  White House and  said, all right,  look, man, you're  a pretty powerful  person now, so we  got to tell you  what happened.  You know, the  Bill Burr bit or  who came up with  that bit on the  show?  It's brilliant.  Well, Bill Burr  is always saying  that, so I'll  just give him  credit.  I think it might  be Bill Burr,  and they take you  into the basement  of the White House  and go, look,  it's true, look,  and they prove it  to me, that they  show me all the  paperwork, I would 
[00:19:30]  still not believe  it.  Still go, come on,  you couldn't pull  that off.  Right.  I don't care what  you did.  Show me the  Kennedy thing, how  you got rid of  him, show me all  the other fun stuff,  but no way in hell  did you do that.  Jesse the body  of Intora, he  seems like a pretty  bright guy.  Well, I guess he  was at some  point.  Let's say how  to Nigel.  Loved him in  Predator.  Loved him.  Who didn't?  I loved him when  he was doing the  WWF stuff.  Yeah.  When he was a  commentator,  ringside. 
[00:20:00]  Fantastic.  Had feuds with  Hulk Hogan.  Yes.  Let's say hi to  Nigel in Kentucky.  Nigel.  Good morning,  gentlemen.  Unless I'm  severely mistaken,  the guy with the  radio voice is Alex  Jones, a conspiracy  theorist who has his  own little show and  he goes into this  topic often.  That's kind of,  you know, you can't  blame him even,  because if you find  a niche like that  in radio where  you're a conspiracy  guy, that's kind of  cool.  You can sit there  on the air and 
[00:20:30]  just kind of blurt  out all this stuff  because I'm sure  he gets the phones  ringing.  And, you know,  you can't even  blame him.  Yeah.  Stupid radio voice.  Oh, no, I'm just  blaming him for the  radio.  I'm so glad you  have a great gig.  It's a gig.  It's like, you know,  the hard right wing,  you know, guys.  You know, you think  they live their entire  life like that?  Come on.  But they got a great  gig going, so they  do it.  Jimmy, give me your  radio voice.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, that's a good  one.  Oh, Jesse, why  are you trying to  try it?  Well, you know, 
[00:21:00]  Jesse, I think  that's fantastic.  It's very interesting.  I think you've got to  put a lot of olives  in your mouth.  Now, if I had a  cue ball in my mouth  and I go, oh, wait,  I do.  Why do you think  the government  would do that?  Oh, that's good,  Jimmy.  Thank you.  Yeah, I like that.  I see enough of these  hacks when I'm on the  road.  Do you?  Hey, a quick observation  before our first break.  I want to thank the DJs 
[00:21:30]  here in New York City  at this fine radio station,  the flagship station of  the Opie and Anthony  show.  Flagship.  For having good breath.  I noticed this morning  for the first time that I  don't have to smell bad  breath anymore.  On the mics.  Through this microphone.  When you work at a radio  station that has a lot of  talk shows, these mics are  horrendous.  Stinking.  Horrible.  Smell.  No, I believe you.  But trust me on this.  Yeah, I don't want to  push it.  You'll be very happy.  I'm not smelling anything, 
[00:22:00]  but I don't want to push it.  There's not a hint.  Oh, we switch the mics  every day?  Oh, that's why.  Okay.  Oh, they're switched.  You mean we only use these?  Opaz's own microphone right  there, so every morning  What about Anthony and  everybody else?  Nobody's requested their  own.  We've had yours since we  started.  Oh, prima donna.  Holy Christ.  No, I'll tell you why.  Why?  Because it used to stink.  It's good to know I don't  have bad breath, because if  I'm the only one, unless I 
[00:22:30]  can't smell my own bad  breath, you should get  your own mic, man.  It's great.  What?  You used to complain about  a certain producer from  another show's bad breath on  that microphone.  Really?  Yeah, we had to get your  own mic, and we've been  switching it every morning.  What producer?  Butchie.  Butchie had bad breath.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I just know the mic had  bad breath.  I never, whatever.  Now the sound going in  stinks.  Hey!  Hey!  But more people use your  microphone anyway. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, that's true.  That's like the Captain  Kirk station.  Well, it's nice, because  there were times, especially  back in the old days.  Oh, yeah, there were a few  people.  Or you would back up way  over here to try to do  your show.  It was just god-awful.  All right, so Jesse  Ventura coming in at 730,  promoting Don't Start the  Revolution Without Me in  bookstores now and on  Amazon.com.  I guess the 9-11 stuff is  going to be the big get with  him today, huh? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, that and, of course,  the big Hulk Hogan rivalry  of 20 years ago.  Yeah, of course.  How funny would it be if  you go through all that and  you go, and how could you  possibly see that?  And he goes, oh, yeah,  good point.  Forget it.  Yeah.  Oh, forget it.  No, we're pretty passionate  about the 9-11 stuff, and it  should get pretty interesting,  especially these two.  Yeah, I mean...  No one has been able to  knock you guys down.  No one.  No one out there.  The simple solution to  the problem. 
[00:24:00]  That's where you've got to  look first, and until you  can dispel it, not just come  up with your own little  theory, but dispel the  simple solution.  Why can't people believe  that?  There's no way they can say  it didn't happen.  But they come up with  their cockamamie conspiracy  theories.  See, my explanation has  always been so simple, is  that as the planes were  approaching, passengers were  leaning out, throwing bombs  at the building.  They hit and started it,  but nobody wants to  listen to Razzle. 
[00:24:30]  I'd like to know how they  did that on a plane with  no windows, by the way.  That's right.  Because you know the  plane had no windows, and  it was marked with Air  Force markings, and it had  pontoons or pods underneath  it.  Yeah.  Because it had armholes.  And then there was pieces  of planes with windows that  they don't want to talk  about found on the ground.  That's right.  And the same bumbling  government that figured  out a way to do this  brilliant, brilliant thing.  Brilliantly executed.  Couldn't figure out how to  not make Colin Powell look  retarded. 
[00:25:00]  Looked like an ass.  Showing an ice cream truck  from space, going, there's  uranium on that, and it's a  little fat kid with a vanilla  sauce there.  With a push-up.  An ice cream truck.  It's like, couldn't they have  figured that out?  It's a mobile biological  warfare base.  Is it?  All right, listen, we've got to  take a break, but let's not  forget, Jesse Ventura coming in  right at 730.  We've got Bob Kelly coming  in.  He's very excited.  His CD, Just a Tip, is in  stores today.  We really want to sell a lot 
[00:25:30]  of them for Bob Kelly, do the  right thing.  Sounds like a DVD, too.  Yeah, absolutely.  So maybe we'll try to be nice  to Bob Kelly today.  It's his big day.  It's his big day.  Let's try to be nice.  Maybe we can all be on the  same team for once.  That'll work for two minutes,  maybe.  And we'll take more of your  phone calls.  877-212-ON-A.  Hey, good morning to  everybody.  Hi.  I knew that wouldn't work.  What happened?  And I love how people are  starting to put the word 
[00:26:00]  stupid in front of their  names.  I like that, actually.  Stupid Danny Fisher writes,  Oh, I love the natural  sounding conversation between  you and Roseanne.  And then he writes,  Boo!  Oh!  I told him I didn't want to  do it.  It's one of those.  I told him those don't  work ever.  It's one of those.  So, Roseanne, tell me about,  I had a fake interview with  Roseanne that they're  thrown into a commercial,  but here's how they do it.  Roseanne does her lines from 
[00:26:30]  L.A. or wherever the hell  she is, and I do my lines  from a dumb studio here in  New York City, and then they  put it together and make it  try to sound like natural  conversation.  Like you're having a  conversation.  And I kept blowing it off.  I'm like, these never work.  And then they're like, well,  it's company-wide.  Everyone's doing these.  And I'm like, all right,  I'll do the best I can.  And I'm already being  called out on it, and I  should be called out on it.  Oh, I'd love to hear that.  Can you hear it?  And I did it about four or  five times trying to sound  natural.  I had other people reading  Roseanne's lines, but those  things never work. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, I'd love to hear it.  Good idea.  Paul got a good idea.  And company-wide, the way you  wrote it, Derek, makes you want  to break your hands.  He wrote, let's hear other  hosts doing the same spot.  And he put four exclamation  points.  By golly, here's the idea of  the century.  How would you read that with  so many exclamation points?  Company-wide, let's hear other  hosts doing the same spot.  Woo!  Woo!  Get those party hats.  It just means excitement.  Oh, folks, it's going to be a  crazy Tuesday.  And they just wear you down 
[00:27:30]  because I'm like, ah, Steve,  tell them these don't work.  I don't want to do this.  Maybe they could come up with  something else.  And Steve came back to me a  couple times and Anthony a  couple times.  And I finally just went, all  right, I'll do it just to get  you out of my hair.  They beat you down like that.  And then, of course, they put  it together.  And, of course, the listeners  are beating me up.  And they should.  Sounds like crap, does it?  It doesn't sound natural  whatsoever.  Hey, I want to acknowledge  it's opening day.  They're up there in Boston  at Fenway. 
[00:28:00]  At Fenway.  And also, it's opening day  for the Mets.  And they're trying to make it  sound like we're going to  miss Shea Stadium down here  in New York.  Yeah.  I'm a huge Mets fan.  Shea Stadium out there in  Long Island.  It's been the worst stadium  for 10 to 15 years.  Easily.  Yep.  And there's a weird thing  going on here in New York.  We're losing Yankee Stadium  and Shea Stadium.  Both stadiums, they're in  their final year.  And this Sunday, they did  a huge, like, I don't know,  like 30, 40-page pullout  of all the history of Yankee 
[00:28:30]  Stadium.  You got Babe Ruth, you know,  and when Babe Ruth retired  and walked out there with his  baseball bat as a cane because  he was weak from cancer.  And you got the Lou Gehrig,  you know, speech.  Luckiest man in the world.  Well, face of the earth.  That was it.  Wasn't too lucky, right?  And all this amazing history  of Yankee Stadium, page after  page after page.  And they're trying to make it  like it's just as important  that Shea Stadium's going away.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  Shea Stadium is an S-hole  and it always has been.  Built in 1964, I believe.  And coming down.  Yeah.  It's the last season.  But they got all the reporters  out there because it's opening  day and they're asking people  their memories of Shea.  And like it's coming down today.  Yeah.  After today's game.  The whole season left.  You're supposed to wait  until the end.  Yeah.  And then go, hey, how you feel?  They're going to rip this down.  You know, it's the last game.  Right.  That's being played here.  But it's in the shadow 
[00:29:30]  of a brand new, like,  kick-ass stadium, I guess.  Yeah, it's pretty much  Camden's.  Camden Yards.  Yeah, that's what they  designed it after.  Well, everyone, you know,  copied Camden Yards.  Yeah.  So we got our version  of Camden Yards.  I went and saw, well, you and I  went and saw a Phillies game  last spring.  And, yeah, it's Camden Yards  in Philly.  Yeah.  Everyone's just ripping off  hoo-hoo Camden Yards.  They're going for that  classic look.  Yeah.  We're getting our version  here in New York, 
[00:30:00]  and they're making a big deal.  I think the only thing  that was, that's important  to Shea Stadium was the  Beatles playing an outdoor  concert there.  Oh, the Beatles played there.  That's pretty much it.  Well, you know something?  The Jets used to play there,  but they got smart  about 20 years ago  and said, look,  we don't want to play  in a huge baseball stadium  where you have to move  bleachers out to make it  almost look like a football  stadium.  Yeah, I think I remember  seeing Emerson Boozer  out there.  Right.  The planes, you know, 
[00:30:30]  fly so low, you feel like  you're actually ducking.  You go to a game and you  can't even hear yourself  think.  No.  If the wind is blown right,  the traffic pattern is,  I mean, right over the mound,  basically.  Yeah, there have been times  where the pitcher just like  steps off the mound.  Because you can't hear.  Yeah, the plane's flying over.  One after another.  I don't think that's going  to change.  The thing is right next  door to it.  Well, that's what I'm  saying, though.  If you're going to build  a whole new stadium,  why do you keep it in the  flight of LaGuardia?  Why wouldn't you move it  somewhere else so we don't  have to deal with the planes? 
[00:31:00]  What the Mets want to do  if they were smart,  they want to put a giant  Mr. Met that goes up  about 600 feet so the  planes have to go around it.  What is that?  It's a giant baseball head.  We got a turn.  A retarded person in the  clouds.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Our mascot is a waterhead  with a Mets cap on it.  If that doesn't tell you a  lot about my favorite team.  Why can't I like a cool team?  I don't know.  The Mets are not cool.  Mets are a chick team. 
[00:31:30]  Sorry.  Had to be said.  A lot of the girls love the  Mets.  So they're trying to make a  big deal.  They got all of the  reporters out there because  it's opening day.  They're out there at 4 in the  morning.  What's happening at 4 in the  morning that you have to do a  little report on the last  opening day at this S-hole that  is Shea Stadium.  It's pitch black out there.  There's nothing going on.  And then, I don't know, we got  to try to make this interesting  for the rest of America.  I think we can.  We have this mayor, Mayor  Bloomberg, that came up with  this great idea. 
[00:32:00]  But you see, he's a  billionaire, so he doesn't  understand the value of a  dollar whatsoever.  No.  He came up with this, what  is it called, a pricing  plan?  The Congestion Pricing  Plan.  This is for people with  stuffy noses.  Right.  And they did this, didn't  they do this in London or  something like that?  Didn't they?  Didn't they?  Who cares?  I think he got this idea from  London or somewhere.  Somewhere over there.  But basically, if you're coming  into Manhattan and you're 
[00:32:30]  going to drive below, what  street was it again?  60th.  60th.  Okay.  60th and below.  So Midtown, picture the  heart of your city.  Yeah.  And if you want to drive  into the heart of your city,  put city here.  He came up with this bright  idea that you would have to  pay tolls.  On top of the tolls you're  paying to get into the city.  It would cost you eight  bucks to get in if you're a  car.  I believe it was 20 bucks for  a truck.  Right.  To come in.  And that's above the, I  think, I don't even know what  the Midtown Tunnel is these  days.  I got an easy pass. 
[00:33:00]  Eight bucks?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it would be $16 if you're  coming through the Midtown  Tunnel from Long Island and  then Jersey, the same thing.  You're still paying your  Holland and Lincoln Tunnel  tolls and George Washington  Bridge tolls.  But above and beyond those,  another eight bucks to get  in.  It's crazy.  Believe me, I would like it  because they don't put it in  place until 6 a.m.  I'm in before then, so I  wouldn't even have to pay.  Well, it would force a lot of 
[00:33:30]  people to just, you know,  come in really, really early  and just hang around because  no one has that type of  money.  This mayor doesn't understand  that.  He's a billionaire.  He doesn't understand, I'll  say it again, the worth of a  dollar.  Yeah.  We have a bridge.  It's $11.  Verrazano's $11 to go over  now.  The bridge was in Saturday  Night Fever, so it's well  worth the price.  So a lot of people are  breathing a sigh of relief  here in New York City.  Let's go to the bridge and  do some dancing.  Yeah.  That this plan of his is  done, right, for now? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Oh, they crushed it.  Good.  Thank God.  They didn't even vote on  it.  That's how they were.  In Albany, they were  supposed to have a vote on  this pricing plan, and they  said, you know something?  This ain't even worth voting  on.  Go screw.  Good.  I mean, gas is up to,  what, $3.50 now?  How the hell are you  supposed to afford coming  into Manhattan to work?  Well, you're not, but I'll  tell you one thing.  It would have made traffic  so much nicer.  You know what they got to  do?  Get rid of half the cabs.  Get rid of half the 
[00:34:30]  goddamn savage cabs.  I hate them.  Oh, I know you city people  love the stupid cabs.  I hate them, too, dude.  People will drive if they  don't have cabs.  They're making up for  people driving.  Believe me.  Monorails!  You don't use cabs, and  you know what?  They're a big part of our  audience.  Oh, I know.  What, the cab drivers?  All right, if you're  listening to the show, I  love you, but you know the  people that don't.  I'm telling you.  They're listening to...  It's those people. 
[00:35:00]  With religious icons on  their dashboard.  You don't even know what  religion it is.  What's up there?  You can guess.  It's like Monopoly pieces.  Right.  You can guess what  religion they are.  Half the time, you're  going to be wrong.  There's religions you've  never heard of.  I'm talking about my black  brothers.  Oh, the homeboys?  The black cabbies love  this show.  I can't tell you how many  black cabbies have  recognized me when I  jumped into a cab. 
[00:35:30]  It's unbelievable.  I would think they'd be  listening to something else,  but they're listening to  this show.  They probably think you're  Ellen Barkin.  Wait, why am I laughing  at that really hard?  I couldn't think of a  white lady with blonde  hair.  Oh, they should have  went with Ellen DeGeneres,  but then again, I finally  cut my dumb hair.  I think here's the major  problem in New York City.  Something that doesn't  happen in a lot of other  cities, and they have no  concept of this, double  parking.  When people make  deliveries, these truck  drivers, they really have  nowhere to go.  They have no choice. 
[00:36:00]  They have no choice.  They hate those guys, but  when you live in a  neighborhood, you understand  where are they supposed to  park?  Where are you going?  Yeah, you're going 20  blocks away to then haul  all your crap from the  back of your truck to where  it's got to be.  So they double park, which  is parking next to a car  that's already parked.  Right.  So you're parking in the  middle of the road, but  they have no choice.  I used to get mad at those  guys, but I understand that  whole situation now.  And also, they're very big  fans of the Opie and  Anthony show as well.  There's a lot of wow  stickers on those double  parking trucks.  Oh, my God.  And it's such a scam, too,  because they have nowhere to 
[00:36:30]  go to make their  deliveries here in New  York City.  So they double park.  They're in a store for 15  minutes.  They're not just hanging  out.  They're working.  They're working men and  some women, mostly working  men, let's be honest.  And they have to go from  delivery to delivery.  They don't have time to just  hang out.  So they want to double park,  get their load off their  truck and go off to the  next place.  Right.  Yeah.  These scums with their  little carts will give out  the tickets like that in a  second.  It's such a scam going on.  But that does screw traffic 
[00:37:00]  up.  But there's nothing that can be  done about it.  No.  How about this?  If certain underground tunnels.  Well, I was going to say you put  little, little mechanical feet on  the trucks and let them walk  down the sidewalk.  Like those Star Wars things.  I got a solution for the  congestion problem, but no one  has asked me yet.  So I'll just sit here and wait.  What's your solution?  Oh, thanks for asking, Anthony.  Righty.  Zip lines.  Zip lines?  Think about it.  Zip lines. 
[00:37:30]  And I am dead serious.  I'm trying to think.  Have you ever gone on vacation,  done a zip line, my friend?  Zip line?  We got plenty of awesome  buildings in this city.  You could be zipping all over  Manhattan.  Oh, you mean you just hold on to  like a T-bar with a pulley on a  cable that's running between  buildings?  Yes.  High above the city.  How cool would that be?  How cool would it be watching  people plummet to their deaths?  No, you're strapped in.  Oh, you're strapped in?  All right, fine.  I'm all for it.  How about one lousy zip line?  Can you imagine?  And that's how you get.  That would rule. 
[00:38:00]  Let's update this city.  I say zip lines.  Updated with a technology  thousands of years old.  Well, it's fun when you go  on vacation.  That would be interesting.  Why not have some fun while  you're working?  Why does all the fun have to be  when you're on vacation two  weeks out of a year?  This city's supposed to have  like elevated sidewalks.  Go through the buildings.  Monorails.  Can these people listen closely  to the show?  I'm in no mood today.  Camden Yards is in Baltimore,  not Philly, stupid.  Oh, my God. 
[00:38:30]  You idiot.  You didn't write that.  I didn't.  I'm reading it.  No, I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I believe Mr. Hughes was explaining  how this stadium, the new stadium  in Philly, also looks like Camden Yards.  There's a lot of Camden Yards  looking stadiums.  Not the fact that Camden Yards  is in Philly, you dunce.  See, if you left that awful city  of Baltimore every once in a while,  you would notice that there's  things going on in other cities.  Ugh.  What? 
[00:39:00]  I got it.  What happened?  Yeah.  The congestion.  Congestion.  Oh, oh, oh.  Jimmy?  You tie a bunch of balloons  to the truck.  When the man goes,  the truck hovers a little bit  and people drive under it.  And then he pops them  and it comes down.  And you could be driving under it  while the...  I like it.  A bunch of balloons.  How about the whirlybirds?  We haven't used that technology  to its fullest yet.  Whirlybirds?  Whirlybirds.  We need to do something.  How about these delivery guys  forget the trucks  and carry stuff  from the home warehouse 
[00:39:30]  to our places?  On their heads.  That's right.  In the basket.  I mean,  the tiger's attacking them.  I was doing the math  with this congestion pricing plan.  It's like,  gas is up to about $3.50  depending where you are, right?  Then you have to already pay  outrageous amounts  for the tunnels  and the bridges.  And then he wanted to throw  this congestion plan  where now that you want  to go into Midtown  you have to pay  an extra amount of money?  Let's say $16 a day  to get in  and then the parking 
[00:40:00]  costs an arm and a leg.  Stop taking money  from the working man.  Yeah, man.  Start looking into  the red tape  and the corruption  of this city.  You'll find plenty of money.  But no one wants to be,  you know,  wants to take that one on now,  do you?  There's plenty of money  in this city.  It's just being used  in ways that,  well, we don't know, obviously.  We need a mayor  like Goldie Wilson.  When the hell  did this happen?  Well, it didn't.  Are you doing more  Back to the Future stuff? 
[00:40:30]  Of course.  I like Mayor Goldie Wilson.  Yeah.  He totally wrecked Hill Valley.  He just wrecked it.  Yeah.  He said he'd be  a great mayor.  He gets in there  and the place  is a crap hole.  It was all beautiful.  Nice, innocent 50s looking.  And then by the 80s,  there's bums  sleeping on benches.  The movie theater  is like some porno place.  I don't know.  What did Mayor  Goldie Wilson do?  He ruined  Hill Valley.  And if you vote  for Obama, 
[00:41:00]  that's what's going to happen  to this country.  One big Hill Valley.  What?  See how I fit that in?  You know what?  You laugh at the  President Obama.  I like the sound of that.  Ah, sweep up.  You laugh at the  President Obama thing,  but were you watching  CNN at all yesterday?  No.  This Condoleezza Rice thing  is starting to get some legs.  Is it?  As a vice president.  So someone is taking  the black vote  very seriously.  So, uh...  And the youth vote  and all that. 
[00:41:30]  McCain, you think,  is going to get...  It's got some momentum.  They're talking  Condoleezza Rice  as a possible vice president.  It's like, wow,  we got a woman  and a black guy.  Let's get a black woman.  So that's...  Someone is thinking  that Obama has a real shot  or why would they ever  consider Condoleezza Rice  in this situation?  I wonder if she'll do it, though.  Me and Colin...  She's doing her crunches.  She's getting ready, Jimmy.  I saw some piece  she did in a fitness magazine  and she's working out hard.  And she's in her 50s.  Is she married?  I thought she was 
[00:42:00]  and then I've also heard  she's gay.  They're speculating, you know?  Well, Jimmy,  heard that she's gay.  Yes, I did.  Have you really heard that?  Yes.  I've never heard that one.  Rumor and innuendo.  Yeah, it might just be nonsense  because she's single.  Yeah.  But who knows?  She's a single woman  but she's very career-driven.  Yeah.  Perhaps that's it.  Well, I mean,  if you have Condoleezza Rice  as vice president,  then the whole black thing  is pretty much mute.  Mute.  Mute.  Mute.  Mute.  Yeah.  I corrected myself fast.  Shut up, Biroc.  Wow.  Wishful thinking  in a movie theater, 
[00:42:30]  what you just said.  Oh, man,  are you telling the truth?  I went and saw  I Hate Sarah Marshall  and I just,  once again,  I can't go to movie theaters  until, like,  everyone has seen the movie  and then I'll finally go  with me and ten people  that haven't seen  the hit movie.  Yeah.  I can't take it.  Do we have a screening of that  today, I thought, right?  No?  Oh, we do?  I'd go see it.  It's going to be  a very, very popular movie,  this I Hate Sarah Marshall.  I thought it was really good.  What?  Forgetting Sarah Marshall. 
[00:43:00]  Mm-hmm.  But the billboards  are saying  I Hate Sarah Marshall.  Oh, that's smart marketing.  All over New York  on cabs and stuff  it says  I Hate Sarah Marshall.  Yeah, big campaign.  And then I saw  the movie that's called  Forgetting Sarah Marshall  but now I'm calling it  I Hate Sarah Marshall  because the campaigning  is working.  Yeah.  Why didn't they just  call the movie  I Hate Sarah Marshall?  Yeah.  If you're putting that logo  all over New York City.  Because there's other ads  too that say  like my mom told me  about you.  There's a whole bunch  of different ads  with Sarah Marshall  in them, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  It's getting 91%  positive reviews  on RottenTomatoes.com.  So, hey, here's a quickie  before we take a break.  The Olympic Torch  now on a worldwide tour  in advance of the start  of the Olympic Summer Games  in Beijing.  Just about everywhere  the torch goes  trouble follows  with protesters angry  over China's Tibet policy  causing a ruckus  over the weekend  in London  and all day in Paris.  Here at home  there was this strange scene  which unfolded  high atop San Francisco's  Golden Gate Bridge.  In advance of Tuesday's arrival 
[00:44:00]  at the torch here  three climbers  shimmied up these cables  then proceeded  to unfurl two banners.  Any risk that we've taken here  is minor in comparison  to the risks  that people in Tibet  take all the time.  Man!  You know what?  It's their country.  Let them do whatever  the hell they want.  I don't really give a crap  about China and Tibet  and all that.  Well, we keep dealing  with China  and pumping up  their economy  by outsourcing to them  and trading with them 
[00:44:30]  and putting all our dollars there  letting them buy up  all our land over here  and businesses  and everything.  We keep doing that.  we're just  perpetuating  their awful  human rights  which they do  just have awful  human rights.  We've talked about  human rights  in other countries  where we go in  and have to do something  and speak up.  No one ever speaks up  about China.  None of these politicians  come forward  and go  you know  why are we even  dealing with this country?  There's savage people 
[00:45:00]  over there  that treat their  people like crap.  Well, that's why  the whole war is BS  and that's why  I can't even be bothered  with it  because if you want  to really free some people  there's some people  around this world  that need some  real freeing.  Well, you take on China.  Yeah, take on China.  Take on China  and they're people  that aren't allowed  to do anything  anti-government.  They're people  just crushed.  When Bush is talking  about how these people  need to be free  and they need a democracy  shut off.  Don't get me wrong 
[00:45:30]  I don't care.  I could care less  if China clears Tibet out  I don't care.  I'm with you  but if you're going to say  we're sending all our boys  over to the Middle East  to free Iraq  why don't you tell us  the real reason  and then we can accept  that possibly.  Oil men!  We got over 4,000  of our boys  now dead  in the ground  and if you really  want to free some people  take on China.  Go ahead.  Take on that one.  Give that a whirl.  Another H-bomb country. 
[00:46:00]  That's a bit  too complicated now.  Isn't it?  Yeah.  They violate  every environmental law.  Oh yeah.  They're pumping out  all their factories  work like our factories  did in like 1902.  They're just pumping out  coal smoke.  They're running amok.  Yeah.  Can anything  come out of China  without lead on it too?  Who the hell?  How much lead  is there over there?  Do they have to use it  in everything?  So much lead  that you gotta squint. 
[00:46:30]  What?  What?  They love their lead.  They make lead hats  in China.  That's why they're  shorter  statured people.  It's a lovely gift  but it's 217 pounds.  It's a little bit  much for my head.  It's a lead hat.  Please enjoy it.  The Chinese are coming.  China.  I've been saying it forever.  The Chinese are coming.  Covered in lead.  That's right.  And then you get this.  At the White House.  We have a great deal  of concern about  human rights in China 
[00:47:00]  and we've never been  afraid to express  those views.  The president's spokesman  said he was aware  of a new call  from Hillary Clinton  for President Bush  to stay away  from the opening  ceremonies of the games.  So it's a way  to bring some  international pressure  on the Chinese government  right at the moment.  Yeah.  When it wants to be  in the spotlight  and sort of show  a new case of China.  The White House however  says plans remain  on track  for the president  to travel to Beijing.  Democrats in Congress  meantime  continue to press  for a let up  in the crackdown  on Tibetan demonstrators. 
[00:47:30]  Do you think  if you really wanted  George Bush  if Hillary really wanted  George Bush  to boycott  the opening ceremonies  of the Olympics  in China  because of their  horrible stance  on human rights  that you would mention it  if you're Hillary Clinton?  Do you think  George Bush  even if he was going to  would do anything  Hillary Clinton said  to do?  Of course not.  Of course not.  He'd sit there  and go  you know something  it'd look real good  if we boycott  the opening ceremonies. 
[00:48:00]  I think  President Bush  should boycott  the opening ceremonies  of the Olympics  and they need to be like  what is she  what  what  wait a minute  what did that  fat legged  say  she said  boycott  well now we can't  we can't boycott it  I don't like that  that bitch  she ruined it  even if  he was going to do it  you can't take 
[00:48:30]  the Democratic  candidate  and go  look  here  here's the Republican  president  and he's going to do  what this Democratic  candidate says to do  did you  did you say Hillary  of course  oh god no  my favorite part  when she kicks in  here comes  shut up  when the hell  did this happen  she's a fat 
[00:49:00]  rag  nothing's going to  turn her back  now  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  get the short version  today  oh  thank you  mercifully cut short  She's gonna do it  The women are getting really mad at us 
[00:49:30]  Ah, go screw  Hey, oh, bite me  I've been on the road commuting since 4.30am  Liberated woman going to work  To a womanly job  Nurse  And then she writes L-O-L  A womanly job, see  We're convinced just men are up between, what, five and seven  Of course  Plowing the fields  That's right, the broads are just starting to wake  So they can nurse their kids  And cook some breakfast  Right 
[00:50:00]  Do you think Bloomberg is just trying to get people to take mass transit?  Like, uh  Not only that, there was, I believe, something like  Three, was it three billion  Trying to take mass  Three, there was, let's just say  A crap load of money  Since I can't remember, but a lot of it  Was gonna be given  To mass transit  For New York  If this pricing plan went through  The federal government was gonna subsidize  Mass transit  So he was looking to get this huge influx of money 
[00:50:30]  From the government  If they went ahead with this pricing plan  Well, uh, than, how much?  Three hundred fifty-four million dollars  Okay, three hundred fifty-four  I was a little off  That's not  Just a few thousand million  Mass transit doesn't need help  Has anyone been on a subway in this studio?  It's, it's packed all the time  It's in the ass  You know what?  It was money that would have come into the city  Under the guise of being from mass transit  And they would have divvied it up  To some other contracts 
[00:51:00]  And crap  To make friends with people  It's just all  What you were saying before  More corruption  And mismanagement  I like Bloomberg though, man  I do too  But he, he is  Out of touch  You know what?  As far as  He's a little too rich  For the gig  Yeah, all you have to do  Is go to some of these newer cities  And you realize how corrupt  New York City truly is  Well, and then  Go to Boston and realize  How much more corrupt it could be  Well, Boston  But Boston has a lot of new stuff 
[00:51:30]  We don't get new stuff  In New York City  You know what that costs?  Eighty times what it was supposed to  True  But we don't get new stuff here  In New York City for the most part  I think they threw  Buildings  I think they gave us about  Four or five new subway trains  Recently, thank you  But the rest of them  Are the same subways  That we were using  When we came in from Long Island  To see a concert  In Madison Square Garden  And then puke on the train  On the way home  It's the same freaking trains  And subways  I like the new toppling crane gag  We got going here in New York  That's fun 
[00:52:00]  That's new and exciting  Never know when the next one's  Coming down  One right across from us  Over at XM too  Yeah  And it's getting bigger and bigger  Taller and taller  Yeah  And I look at that thing  And it's right across from us  So if it fell away from the building  We are so dead  God, we were thinking the same thing  Because when we were walking over to XM yesterday  I'm looking at that crane thinking  Now if that thing fell right now  What's my move?  And I realize there is no move  Death?  There is no move  You would just be dead  No move?  Take a big dump and rise above it  As it's falling  Every time something like 
[00:52:30]  The crane thing happens  I just think  Right back to the Dennis Leary bit  You know  There's so many ways to die  In New York City  Yeah  That's what makes it so exciting  Exciting to live here  Never know  Before we take a break  And get Bob Kelly on the show  Don't forget  Jesse Ventura  Speaking of Chinese  Mike from Jersey  He's got a great line here  Hopefully he'll deliver it  Perfectly for everybody  Mike, what's up?

[00:53:00]  And then you got  Steven S. from Bayshore  Writes  Why would a woman be up so early  Just to scrub a toilet?  Holy Jesus, Steve  Bad question  We'll try to answer that next  After the break, I guess, right?

[00:54:30]  I like May-ham  We call it May-ham  Radio voice hall of fame  Who would you put on that voice  On that list  There's a lot of guys that sound exactly the same  You got Mancow  Bubby Love Sponge  Likas  And this Alex Jones  They all have pretty much the same voice  The same voice on the radio  Who else would you put on that list, E-Rock?  E-Rock  We need examples of all these guys  And you know what?  We could play  We could play  Guess the radio voice  Guess the radio douche

Oh, you heard the JTT  I thought you made that face  Oh, I know  Because of the bathroom problem  Well, same thing  I know  I obviously was wrong 
[00:57:30]  JTT, yes  The only reason it's better than your last project  Is because it couldn't have been worse  You know, I would like to deny that  But you're absolutely right  Did you  You went down to the other bathroom, Jimmy?  What happened?  Because I walked into this one  And I was belted in the face  By the remnants of what you left  So I had to run down the hall  Well, I think I got a little blockage  Because I had  Let's just put it this way  I had very skinny  Skinny ones  Oh, really?  So they were getting past the blockage  They looked like pretzel sticks  Pretty much 
[00:58:00]  Did a Volkswagen bug  Break down on your road  It looked more like those long peppers  Oh, oh, okay  Not jalapenos  The long ones  Yeah  The long ones  Are those jalapenos?  I think they are  Hey, really fast  The ONA Animation Festival  Is going down Thursday, June 5th  At the Roseland Ballroom  Here in New York City  Something weird happened overnight  This is a really hot ticket  On Friday  We pretty much sold the thing out  Except for like 150 tickets  Yep  And then yesterday  We sold five tickets  It doesn't make sense  What?  It doesn't make sense 
[00:58:30]  That there was such excitement  On Friday  And everyone got their tickets  And then yesterday  We sell five tickets  Something doesn't  Doesn't add up here  That's really odd  We got like 50 tickets left  And this thing  Will officially be sold out  We got $10,000  For first, second, and third place  In this ONA Animation Festival  Nice chunk of change  We're going to have  Two live comedians  All the details  Are up on  ONAradio.com  Also the website  That is named  After this radio show  We're hoping  That the animators 
[00:59:00]  Are getting busy  And getting their stuff together  You know  We're getting a little nervous here  Because we're not hearing  From the animators  Yeah  Give us a buzz  Just give us a clue  That you're working on  A masterpiece  For this ONA Animation Festival  Maybe send a still  Yeah, we're putting  We're putting a lot of faith  Into the fact  That you guys are actually  Animating things  For the ONA Animation Festival  You know why?  When we never asked for them  We got plenty  Right  And now that we're asking  For some type of event  That we want to throw  What are they doing?  Are they working on them? 
[00:59:30]  Are we getting some in?  Are there rules  To the competition?  Not really  For the most part  Not really  Take a clip from the show  One of your favorite clips  And animate it  Yeah  Well the other thing is  We're asking all the animators  Not to put their work up  On any websites  Until this animation festival  Is over  So it's a big surprise  For everybody  So that's scaring us  Because it used to be  That people would just  Put up their stuff  As they completed it  But right now  They're holding it back  We want you to mail it in  To the Opie and Anthony  Animation Contest  111 West 57th Street 
[01:00:00]  Suite 500  New York, New York  10019  We want you to mail it in  So we have a nice  High res copy of this  So when we show it  On the big screen  It's nice  Yeah  And all this info  On onaradio.com  But here are the bullet points  50 tickets left  At tops  And the prize money  Is way up there  $10,000 total  For first, second, and third  I think we're going to do  $5,000 for first  $3,000 for second  $2,000 for third place  I believe  But that money  Could even go up  As more sponsors  Get involved with this thing 
[01:00:30]  Okay  That's a lot of money  I think that's great  That's pretty good  I'm pretty psyched  That we were able  Definitely  Able to get that done  E-Rock working on  The Radio Voice Hall of Fame  He wants to go with  Two categories now  Oh, E-Rock left  Oh, okay  What happened, E-Rock?  What do we got, E-Rock?  Yeah, there's DJs  Who have that heavy  Bassy tone  Like a man cow  And Bubba  But then there's also  The DJs who have  The wacky  Top 40 style  So we're going to go  Wacky Radio Voice  And then the typical  Radio Voice  Who's at the top 
[01:01:00]  Of the wacky  No, I think E-Rock  Should be in that category  Hey, well  If you remember  The guys we're talking about  I like when E-Rock intros  Are worst ofs  Yeah  This one was great  This bit  Such high energy  He talks like that  Like he's about to make a point  But it's all garbage  He's just a fool  Some guy is saying  Animation contest 
[01:01:30]  Florida  He goes  The rules are too strict  I want to make an original  Animation piece  Not do audio of a clip  He doesn't want to take  Something from the show  That's the whole  That's the whole concept  What do you want to do  An itchy and scratchy cartoon  Dope  That's the whole concept  Of the O&A animation festival  That's what makes them funny  Right  Holy gee  This is not Warner Brothers  You dope  We're not auditioning  You're like  Right  Oh my god

[01:13:30]  What happened then  I think yeah  Didn't we say something  Pretty stupid to him  Well what happened then  Sorry Bob  It was one of those  You did ten minutes with him  And then said  Alright so we're gonna be  Coming back in five seconds  And we're gonna start the interview  Oh right  That's hilarious  Yeah I think  Pretty funny  That's true  That's awesome  And he was talking  He was talking on the air  And he thought he was off the air  Yeah  So he's saying all kinds of crap  Yeah I think he  I think he gave out his home address  Yeah  I think 
[01:14:00]  Cause I think there was some kind of connection  Where he lived close to my sister in Florida  So I'm like  Oh yeah where  Where  Oh I'll tell you exactly where  I think he pretty much came  Came out where  His condo  I don't know  Whatever  I'd have to hear it again  Alright so then he called Mike and Mike  This has to be an incredibly special time for you and your family  Oh I can simply say  Wow  Wow  I mean I'm just  I'm in awe  I'm just in awe 
[01:14:30]  You're right  I can't hide it any longer  I was notified  And it won't be official probably today at 11 o'clock  But I have to tell you  I cried like a baby  When a guy told me  I mean  I just can't believe it  That's terrific  That's terrific  I mean I have  I have my bust up there  With people I've idolized  People I've been in awe of  Every time he talks  His adult sons must go  Oh great here she goes again 
[01:15:00]  That guy just weeps  He's known for it  He's got a passion for college basketball  I understand that  But get a hold of yourself  Bunch of young men throwing a ball through a basket  Guess what  Weeping  Stop  Went in as a contributor  I cried in front of my dad  And he told me  If you're ever crying like that again  There better be an arrow sticking out of you  That's what he told me  I cried because of my dad 
[01:15:30]  Did you?  He'd punch me in the face  Throw me down some stairs  Oh god  I remember the day  I learned how not to cry  When you get a beating  And I was like  Oh this is great  That's a good one  Oh this is  I didn't cry  I'm a man  And then 30 years later  I'm crying  You're weeping in some shrink's office  Extreme home makeover  Move that bus  I'm with you  I'm talking  Are you crying?  I'm talking  Oh god  You're crying at little midget women  Getting married  Getting engaged  Oh man  If you don't cry at the whole 
[01:16:00]  Move that bus  You're not human  Move that bus  Oh god  Every freaking son  Great if they backed it over the family  God but I love that  They moved the bus  There was a burnt out husk  Of our house  That's what you get  Every  I had to stop watching that show  Because every Sunday  Like I got the teary eyeballs  On one side of the couch  And my girl is  I know she's got the teary eyeballs  But she should  Because she's a female  It's the worst  It's the worst  Because she goes  Oh baby  Like she loves you more 
[01:16:30]  Because you can shed  But I'm not shedding a tear  Because of that  I'm just thinking of like  My childhood having nothing  And you know  It's all self-centered  Selfish stuff  Yeah it's all like  I had nothing  You know I ate cream of tuna  Every day  Extreme makeover  Yeah when they say  Move that bus  The black family  With the fat lady  Falling down  I've just watched that  No no  You gotta see the black  The same black lady  She was probably  One of the best ever  She just got shot  Because the house  Is still in the same neighborhood  Oh god  God bless 
[01:17:00]  God bless DVR  Because they showed the promo  Of this black family  With the whole move the bus  Moment  And she actually  Passes out  And her daughter  Falls down on the pavement too  We rewinded it about 20 times  Rewound  Rewound sorry  We rewound it like 20 times  Over and over again  Watching her fall down  That looks like  That's the same emotion  That comes out when  Like their son is laying dead  In the street  Yeah  It's just one emotion  They fall down on the ground 
[01:17:30]  Very emotional people  Yeah  I like how they made it brick too  They made it still look like  The projects  No this is  This is when  They're telling her  This is when they're telling her  That she's going to get a new house  Oh that is  They got to find the clip  Where they move the bus  Because this same lady  Falls down again  Is that when they  Pick her up  They yell  Move that bus  She's a large woman  Did she really pass out  Or just fall  Because she's clumsy and fat  She looks passed out  No when they move the bus 
[01:18:00]  She definitely passes out  Because you see  Her legs just  Go weak  I don't see it up there  Danny  Unfortunately  We'll try to find it  For after the break  We have to take a break  You see how her hair  Kind of flies up  Like an old bitch  Being punched in the head  Yeah  We have to watch that  Over at XML  Of course we do  Please  They put that whole bit  Up on YouTube  If you search  Opie and Anthony  Fantastic  And hit date  You'll see the latest  Opie and Anthony videos  On YouTube  And they show 
[01:18:30]  The old lady  The 90 some odd  Year old lady  Getting punched by the black guy  With your commentary  It's pretty funny  Actually  It's worth checking out  Hey  The Dick Vitale clip  You got a short clip  Of us making fun of him  Danny  Yeah  It's just  Just to briefly set it up  What you guys had done  Was you had him on the phone  For maybe about five minutes  And then told him that  Okay we're gonna  We're about to go back  Into the show  And then he  Just immediately  Once you guys hit the music  He turns it on  You know  Because he was kind of  He was kind of flat at first  And then he just kind of 
[01:19:00]  Turns on all his emotion  When you say that  You're on the air  Very good  It just seems like  It's kind of hard  For someone to pass up  That kind of money man  Because if you're in high school  All of a sudden  The team is like  Well you know  Yeah  Most of these kids  Come from socially  Disadvantaged situations  Where obviously  In a stroke of a pen  They changed their whole life  For their family as well  I mean one understands that  True  Good point  Can you hear us now?  Yeah I hear you better now  Alright because I think  We're getting ready  To go back into the show  Okay  Are you guys on live right now? 
[01:19:30]  And we're back  With the O.P. and Anthony program  The O.N.A. virus  Spreading across America  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio  On the phone line  We got Dick Vitale  Hey Dick  How you doing guys?  What's going on?  It's been a long time  Since we've talked to you  I think we talked to you once  On the old show  Back at WNEW  Well let me tell you this man  I know you've not been  Following college hoops  Like you should  And you've missed  A heck of a lot  Let me tell you  There you go  Oh that was horrible  We busted him pretty good 
[01:20:00]  I hear my voice  During that interview  Yeah  I have no recollection  Of that whatsoever  No?  None  Were you high on dope?  No I've been  It's been 18 years  Nine months  Six weeks  Two days  And four hours  This is why Voss  Should be shot  With a salt gun  In his mouth  Because he says  Without a drink  Or a drug  In my body  In my body  Can't fit  With all the  Swollen tumors  On my kidneys  Oh we gotta take a break  This would be great  But we're 15 minutes  Damn it  Yeah we're really late 
[01:20:30]  For a break  And we got Jesse Ventura  Standing by  We're gonna talk to him next  We got Robert Kelly  In studio  Just a tip  Is in stores now  The CD slash DVD  So go to Amazon.com  And pick it up  Right Robert?  I'll go to the store  And pick it up  Alright very very good  Opie and Anthony  We gotta get right back  Into this  It's the Opie and Anthony  Show  Robert Kelly  Hanging with us today  His CD  Just a tip  Is out there  And available  For purchase  Yeah  And we also want to  Welcome Jesse Ventura  To the Opie and Anthony  Show  Hey Jesse 
[01:21:00]  How are you sir?  Good Opie  How are you doing today?  Anthony  I'm doing very well  Great  Thank you  Although I'm on  West Coast time  So this is very early  In the morning for me  Oh yeah  It's very early  If you're on  East Coast time too  Okay  We haven't gotten  Used to this  Whatsoever  The book's called  Don't Start the Revolution  Without Me  In bookstores now  Saw you on  Larry King  Yeah and  A lot of  You make a lot of  Sense and a lot of  Stuff  I like your politics  I like your  Your dislike 
[01:21:30]  Of a lot of the  Politics that's going  On right now  Yeah very much so  That's one of the  Reasons I wrote the  Book and you know  I  It was very interesting  Because I had two  New York Times  Bestsellers prior to  This book and so  I didn't care about  Making money on this  Book I didn't take  A pittance for  Front money compared  To before I got  These big chunks of  Change to write the  Two previous books  But we took this  When Dick Russell and I  We both lived down in  The Baja you know  Deep down in the 
[01:22:00]  Baja in Mexico and  We would meet once a  Week to work on the  Book so we completed  It all down there and  Brought it back here I  Was turned down by  24 publishers why is  That why and I don't  Know I mean it's it's I  Have two New York Times  Bestsellers so you think  I'd have some credibility  Sure I don't we you can't  Answer why they just turn  You down and so we  Finally found Skyhorse  Which is a relatively  New publishing company  But the good thing is  They're affiliated with  Norton distribution which  Is huge  Oh Jimmy's 
[01:22:30]  Jimmy  Out of your condo  But I mean you know  And that's the key once  You're published then  You got to make sure  You're with the right  Distributor so you can  Get the book out there  Yeah  And you know they're  Doing a great job right  Now and we'll see what  Happens  Speaking of Larry King  I was stunned that night  When he asked the  Question should Jesse  Ventura be running for  President and he had  15,000 people respond  88 percent said yes 
[01:23:00]  88 I figured if I'd get  60 that would be  Tremendous  Well was he implying you  Should or he thought you  Were  No  Aren't you president  And no I'm not running  I would have to sit down  And my wife after 32 years  Might leave me if I did  So  Well the whole thing is  You know there seems to be  This want for change  From the people in this  Country but it looks like 
[01:23:30]  Business as usual  Even Obama is running on  This campaign of change  Yet it's still  Washington politics  You're pretty extreme  In your want  And your  The way you would  Execute a change  In this country  You mean common sense  Is now extreme  That's what I liked  About what you had to say  And what I was listening to  It sounds  Very sensible  Yeah well I've always  Been a common sense  Person  And as much as  Barack Obama  Talks change 
[01:24:00]  He's still just  Another democrat  And he will be  Have his strings  Pulled by the  Democratic party  They're all puppets  And that's where  I'm different  Well that's what  I was listening to you  Saying no party  You said that there  Shouldn't  There shouldn't even  Be parties  That's how I feel  About it  I think you should  Run on who you are  And not on  Like I like to  Refer to them as  The democrips  And the rebloodlicans  They're the same  As the crips  And blood street gang 
[01:24:30]  Only these guys  Wear brooks brother suits  You hate the  Two party system  Obviously  Well I hate  The two parties  Because they have  No credibility  If I can tell  A story quickly  When I ran for  Mayor of Brooklyn  Park  The sixth largest  City in Minnesota  Way back in 1990  It was a non-partisan  Election  Which means  There's no party  Involvement  Because it's a  Local election  Which many of them  Are  But yet the  Leaders of the  Democratic and  Republican parties  Sent a letter  To every citizen 
[01:25:00]  Of Brooklyn Park  Calling me the most  Dangerous man  In the city  Well I ended up  Winning the election  Defeating the 25 year  Incumbent 67%  To 33%  Right  Two to one  Dem I won all  21 precincts  Including the one  He lived in  No that's got to  Be a message  You can't even  Win with your  Neighbors  Well here's the  Point I'm getting  To  After I won  That election  Two weeks later  These two parties  Then came courting  Me independently  To join them  And I said to them  But why would you 
[01:25:30]  Want the most  Dangerous man  In the city  You know a month  Ago you wrote  Letters to the  People of Brooklyn  Park and now  Because I won  I'm now an  Important person  Who should be  Part of your party  You don't even  Care what I stand  For and that  Showed me clearly  They have no  Credibility  That's  Yeah that's part  Of the Washington  Politics where  They'll beat the  Crap out of each  Yeah yeah well  I'm talking about  Now with Obama  And Hillary  Especially  They will beat  The crap out of  Each other  Until one of them  Becomes the candidate 
[01:26:00]  And then the other  One's going to hop  On board and talk  About how great  They are  And where is  The credibility  It's just  None  Yeah  With them  They have no  Credibility  These two parties  It's whether you  Can win and deliver  A victory for them  Right  And then  Will you stay  In line with them  Yeah  March in their  Lockstep  Once you do  Get their nomination  Or go on to win  As a part of  Their two parties  You obviously  Have a passion  For politics  Why did you  Get into it  So late in your life  I never really  Had a passion for it 
[01:26:30]  And I never  Expected to get into it  It seems like  It came out of  Nowhere though  Because we obviously  All know you  From the wrestling  And  You know it was  A new job  It actually started  In that mayoral race  I lived in a neighborhood  That had a big  Huge wetland  And they were going  To give us  Concrete curb  And gutter  And of course  When they gather water  They have to put it  Somewhere  Well we're right  We were right next  To the Mississippi River  And it was illegal  For them to put  This water into  The Mississippi River  So they were going  To all pump it  Into this wetland  And 400 of us 
[01:27:00]  In our neighborhood  Signed a petition  To City Hall  And took it up there  Saying that was  Unacceptable  Well we were voted  Down 7 to nothing  And I sat back  And thought you know  I could have accepted  5 to 2  Or 4 to 3  We couldn't convince  One of these people  Not one  400 people  That's a lot  For a neighborhood  Right  You know  In a smaller city  And so it was  At that point  I started paying  Attention to politics  And one day  I was up there 
[01:27:30]  In an argument  With them  And I was at the podium  You know  Because in city council  Meetings  They're the grunts  They got to look  To people  To people  Right in the eye  That's why  As a mayor  I know what it's like  To be on the grunt  Level of politics  And I looked at the council  And I said  And the mayor  The 25 year incumbent  And I said  You're going to make me  Run against you  Aren't you  And I didn't really  Want to do it  But his buddy up there  Started laughing  And said  You can't win  Oh boy  And no one tells me that  You know  That I can't  I'm a Navy SEAL 
[01:28:00]  We don't believe  In the word can't  And so I knew  When I walked out  That night  I was running for mayor  And I became the mayor  Then I did one term  Could have been re-elected  I went back  To the private sector  For four years  And then I saw  An injustice happening  In Minnesota  Where we had  Huge budget surpluses  And these guys  Were spending it  Now this  What this means  Is that they budgeted  But because the economy  Was so strong  Their taxes brought in  You know  Millions more dollars 
[01:28:30]  Than what they budgeted for  They have no right  To spend that money  Like kids in a candy store  So I started saying  If I were the governor  I would give this money back  To the people  It's you know  It's not theirs  It's ours  Well I kind of  As you know on radio  Your credibility is everything  And I kind of  Backed myself into a corner  By saying  If I'd have ran for governor  And so then I ended up  Having to run for governor  And amazingly won  Why no  Because it said here  In the back of the book  It says you were  One of the most  Highest approval ratings 
[01:29:00]  In history  As Minnesota governor  Why did you not  Go again  I mean  Well because  Well because again  I believe that  One of our inherent  Problems today  In government  Is the career politician  Right  I don't think  Our forefathers  Had in mind  That people would make  35 and 40 year careers  Out of getting elected  And the incumbent  Has a huge advantage  In getting reelected  So I choose  To only do one term  And then go back  To what I used to do  Imagine that concept 
[01:29:30]  Serving  And when you're done  Serving  Going back  I was one of two  Independent governors  A lot of people  Don't know that  Angus King of Maine  Was a two term  Independent governor  Up in Maine  And ironically  Minnesota and Maine  Every year  Lead the nation  In voter turnout  So if you offer  A viable third party  Candidate  Or a third candidate  You're going to get  A much higher voter turnout  While Angus  After serving  Eight years as mayor  The media charged up  To him and said  Governor  What's it going to be now 
[01:30:00]  Congress  The Senate  Angus looked down  And said  No I'm going home  He said  I've spent eight years  I've got a lot of things  At home  That haven't been done  And I'm going back  To do that  And the other reason  Quickly  My wife's health  I didn't go public  With this  But my wife  Contracted Epstein-Barr-Mano  The moment I won  Governor  And it evolved  Into this chronic  Fatigue syndrome  And she paid hell  For it  And I will say this  She means way more  To me  Than holding any 
[01:30:30]  Public office does  And so  We've now been living  In the Baja  Her health is  Completely back now  So you know  Maybe I'm back now  But rest assured  If her health  Goes awry again  I've been married  To her for 32 years  And she's the mother  Of my children  That's far more  Important to me  Than holding a  Political office  Although I would say  There are probably  A few politicians  That couldn't make  That statement  By the way  I'm a statesman  Not a politician  Statesmen come and serve  And go back to  What they used to do 
[01:31:00]  Politicians make it careers  Well that's why  You barely get any change  It's business as usual  It's the same people  In there doing the same thing  There's no new ideas  Coming in  Because there's no new people  With fresh new ideas  It really is tragic  I want to know  Some of your stances  On some popular  And unpopular issues  Going on  The war  How do you feel about that?  I've opposed the Iraq war  Since before it happened  And I'll tell you  My personal reasons for it  My father was a 
[01:31:30]  World War II veteran  My mother was a  World War II veteran  She was a nurse  In North Africa  My brother's a Vietnam  Veteran as am I  I never believed  That I would ever  See my country  Line up our military  At the border  Of another sovereign nation  Regardless of a dictatorship  There's dozens of them  Out there  And we would invade  That country  Overthrow that government  And occupy it  That's what the Nazis did  That's what the communists did 
[01:32:00]  And now we've done it  And I can't hold my country  On a pedestal anymore  Because of George W. Bush  He is the orchestrator  Of this folly  He was a Vietnam draft dodger  Along with Cheney  I like to refer to them  As chicken hawks  They were chicken  When it was their time  To go fight  And now they're hawks  And his National Guard service  If I would have served  In the manner that he did  Not showing up for duty station  Allowing your flight physical  Delapsed by not showing up for it 
[01:32:30]  And losing your flight status  Of being a pilot  And all the things that he did  He dishonors my honorable discharge  Because I do not believe  I would have gotten  An honorable discharge  If I would have served  In the manner that he did  He deserved only a general discharge  Not an honorable one  When he took off  And went to Harvard Business School  He was supposed to report  To the National Guard unit  Up in Boston  He never did  That's an unauthorized absence  You get court-martialed 
[01:33:00]  For that generally  Now you didn't fall for the thing  A lot of people were bamboozled  By the weapons of mass destruction  And that was the reason  We were going in  Because I've got to be honest with you  At the beginning of the war  You know, everybody was  Frothing at the mouth  Looking at this evidence  On television  And going, hey, you know  If this guy's got all this stuff  Maybe we do have to step in here  And he is a threat  To national security  And world security  The stability of the area  And then when we found out  That this was all crap 
[01:33:30]  All of a sudden  The war took on this other thing  Of we must free these people  And again  A dictatorship  I don't care  If the people get  Aggravated enough  With their leaders  There's supposed to be a revolution  This is the way it works  Not some other country  Swooping in  To put our values  On people that don't really want  If you want freedom  You'll fight and die for it  Absolutely  Well, first of all  Why was there a rush to war?  He had no delivery mechanism  Even if he had weapons 
[01:34:00]  Of mass destruction  You have to have a delivery mechanism  To get him here  You think Saddam Hussein  Had rockets that could reach  The United States?  Absolutely not  We were keeping a close eye on him  And if he certainly  Could reach anyone else  Like Israel  If he tried  You think the Israelis  Wouldn't respond?  Ha ha  Guess again  Yeah  You know  The point was  What was the rush to war?  The inspectors  He said he'd let them back in again  Why couldn't we wait  Four or five months  For these inspectors 
[01:34:30]  To do their job?  But it was like  Oh no  We gotta get in there  Before the inspectors  Get in there  There was this rush to war  To get in there  You know  And like Richard Clark  The only honest guy  Who in front of the Line 11 commission  The only one who apologized  For 9-11  Like he said  The day after  They were talking Iraq  Remember that?  He was saying  But it was Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan  And they were saying  No, get us Iraq  Right  See this was all a planned operation  You know 
[01:35:00]  From top to bottom  And I'll tell you quite honestly now  I have my doubts about 9-11  Now that's  Yeah  That brings us there  We listened to some clips of you talking  Can we take a break  Because we're really late  And we'll pick it up  With the 9-11 stuff  Because like Anne said  We started our show  Because we found that really interesting  And we definitely don't agree with you  But I wanted to get into this  And see  Well we'll see what  Yeah let's have some fun with that  And we'll see how you counter  My point is  Why is it  No no stop  After the break  Trust me  We'll give you the floor 
[01:35:30]  How about please stop  Yeah  Just stop  Yeah  Six-eighth is a Navy SEAL  If you'd like to stop  We'd appreciate it  It's just a good  Stop  Go ahead  Stay seated  It's a good place  I understand  Yeah I understand  You gotta go  No no  You gotta go to the break  Put the show on  Go ahead  Alright  The book is called  Don't Start the Revolution Without Me  It's Jesse Ventura  When we come back  We're gonna talk about 9-11 big time  So stay there  Opie and Anthony  Gotta get right back into this  The Opie and Anthony show  We got Jesse Ventura in studio  Very interesting guest by the way 
[01:36:00]  Oh he's great  The book is  Don't Start the Revolution Without Me  It's in bookstores and on Amazon.com  Right now as we speak  And a couple of quick signings  If you want to meet Jesse  And get your book signed  Today's the 8th  I believe the 10th  He's going to be in New Jersey  At Bookends Bookstore  It's a great independent bookstore  In Ridgewood, New Jersey  It's really close to New York  And then April 11th  He will be at the Barnes & Noble  On Route 3 in Clifton  Also fairly accessible from New York City  That's at 7.30pm on April 11th 
[01:36:30]  And the bookends in Jersey 6.30  On the 10th  No book signings in New York City?  Don't ask me  That's a little weird  That's beyond me  You gotta talk to the publishers  And all that stuff  I just go where I'm told  I think they're scared of you  They're scared of Jesse Ventura  You said none were available  Like a lot of the bookstores  Were saying nothing was available  So maybe they're feeling  That this is a  They're scared  They don't want to touch this project  For some reason  Which makes me want to read this book  Even more  So the 9-11 thing  Where do we start with this? 
[01:37:00]  Well first of all  Let's start with the fact  That why our president  Would stonewall any investigation  For two years  Why would you do that?  I was an elected official  If something like that  Would have happened on my watch  I would welcome the investigation  Immediately  So that we could learn from it  And hopefully be able to stop it  From ever happening again  Why would our president  The only reason he finally agreed to it  Was the fact that the survivors of it 
[01:37:30]  The relatives  Put so much political pressure  That they had to finally succumb to the pressure  So why would he do that?  I think there was this feeling of  You know  We must protect national security  There are secrets that need to be kept  I'm not saying it's right or wrong  But anytime you have a big event  There seems to be  Or anytime they want to cover up something  They throw it into national security  Which means we're not allowed to see it  That too  But now the problem I have 
[01:38:00]  With this 9-11 conspiracy  Wait, wait, wait  Let me lead for a moment  Okay  Why is it that  Wait  You're bigger  You're bigger  You're an ex-Navy SEAL  Go ahead  Okay  Well, no  Why is it that if you simply bring it up  And you have questions  You're immediately attacked  Your credibility  Not you guys  Not you guys  Your credibility's attacked  They attack you  And call you a conspiracy theorist  Okay  The government's 
[01:38:30]  Is just a conspiracy theory too  There's no proof  To what they've told us  Now what they want us to believe  And what they've sold us  Is that 19 Islamic radical terrorists  Came to this country  Armed with box cutters  And they defeated  Our multi-billion dollar air defense system  All while taking orders  From a bearded guy  In a cave in Afghanistan  Now that's  When you phrase it  Oversimplified version  I'll tell you what 
[01:39:00]  Oversimplified  That's what they told us  It's very oversimplified  That is what happened  I think  What happened  Yes  Box cutters  Now in this day and age  If someone pulls a box cutter out on a plane  He's going to get his ass handed to them  By the entire group of passengers  The weapon they had  Was hope  That was their weapon  The hope that they were going to land safely  And let's just leave these guys alone  Because it was an unprecedented event  That's why people didn't take action  That's why just a few Islamics with box cutters 
[01:39:30]  Were able to fly these planes into buildings  Why can't that be accepted  As we were hated  We still are around the world  Alright  And these people decided  Alright  Now  Wait wait wait  One thing he forgot  One thing he forgot  What  And they had this from phone calls  From people  Yeah the phone calls  That don't work  From that height  Right but they were a lot lower  When they were coming to the buildings  Oh okay  Was that the  Always make a convenient answer here  That's accurate  Yeah  Okay  They weren't at 30,000 feet  It's the easy  The bottom line  They thought they had bombs  I'm saying that's another thing 
[01:40:00]  Is they thought they were going to  How come we couldn't find the black boxes  Hmm  The two black boxes  The indestructible black boxes  That you could  They've had planes fly into  They've had planes fly into  Mountains  And they find the black boxes  Yet the two that hit the trade centers  Those convenient black boxes  Could never be located  Yet  Wait a minute  Wait  Wait  Wait  Wait  Wait  Wait  Wait a minute  These are indestructible  They're designed  To survive a crash  Right 
[01:40:30]  Yet  They found supposedly  The paper passport  Of one of the hijackers  That conveniently  They could find that  But not the black boxes  I would never say  There's not  Huge inconsistencies  Okay  Now let's go on  Let's go on  To the strikes themselves  Explain to me  How these buildings  Could fall  At the rate of gravity  How they could fall  At the rate of gravity  Yeah  If you took  If you took a billiard ball  And dropped it in a vacuum  It would hit the ground 
[01:41:00]  In 9.3 seconds  From that height  These buildings  Were down in 10  So what  Now how  Wait a minute  Go to physics  For a moment  You've got a moving object  Hitting one that's not  They're telling us  They pancaked  All the way to the ground  What  With no resistance  But they also had  There was no resistance  At all  There's also something  With the building's design  Where they kind of  Bowed out  Like a bow  Because of the way  The buildings were designed  I mean  There was like a  Picture two bows  Being kind of bent out  So things are just  Falling through  And there was also 
[01:41:30]  I heard this argument made  And  No  The building's designed  There's a formula  Which explains  The building was designed  To withstand  A 707  Which is a bigger plane  Right  But first of all  In all these things  That you're saying  Like the fact that  All I'm doing  Is asking questions  I know  But I'm saying  We're trying to give  Some kind of  Common sense answers  And we give a  Common sense answer  You're like  Well  That's because  Every answer you have  Is convenient  They weren't at  30,000 feet  Making those phone calls  And if this blithering  Idiot government  Could pull off  This massive conspiracy 
[01:42:00]  Why do you do it  With airplanes  Why don't you just  I mean  If they could  Go through all this  Why don't you just  Park two trucks  In the basement  Like was done in 93  And do it that way  A. You kill more people  B. You remove  The nonsensical  The equation  Of the airplanes  All the phone calls  That were made  To loved ones  There's Arabs  On the plane  Yeah  You know  Some of those  Neat phone calls  That were made  Did you ever call  Your mom  And use your last name  Some of the calls  The last name  Was  Hi mom  This is 
[01:42:30]  And they used  Their last name  So what's the  Explanation to that  That's irrelevant  Those are small things  Let's talk about  Maybe they were doing  That to leave  A final record  Of themselves  Let's talk about  Wait let's talk about  The plane fuel  It's four-fifths  Kerosene  Plane fuel  Doesn't burn hot  Kerosene  Now if you use  A burner  When you go camping  You use propane  That burns way hotter  Than kerosene  So by using  Their logic  If I turn my  Propane camp stove 
[01:43:00]  On for like  Four hours  With the flame  Shouldn't the  Greats melt  But they don't  Do they  Yet they have  Us believing  That kerosene  Could melt  I-beam  Construction steel  In a building  It just  Wait wait  Wait wait  And the smoke  Got continually  Darker  Now any fireman  Will tell you  That when smoke  Gets continually  Darker  It's because of  Lack of oxygen  Which means  The fires were  Cooling  Not getting hotter  Firemen don't agree  With you  Firemen think  That what happened 
[01:43:30]  A lot of firemen  Agree with me  I've never met one  We've had a tremendous  Amount of cops  Listened to this show  I've never met a fireman  That's thought that  Well okay  All right  Ever  All right  Getting back to the  Original thing  Why if you bring up  Questions on this  Are you attacked  Not you  But we're bringing up  Questions too  You're not answering the question  I'll answer you  I don't have the answers  I'm not saying that I do  I'll let you know why  But nobody's given me  An adequate answer  And okay  Now I realize 
[01:44:00]  Is that the world  Probably knows more  About demolition  Than I do  Even though I spent  Four years  As a member of the  Navy underwater  Demolition team  And I was trained  By Chief Warrant Officer  Casey  Who I consider  The greatest demo man  On the planet  But yet I  You know  Don't judge me  To have any knowledge  Of demolition  But then don't you know  That what it takes  To bring down  A building  In a controlled blast  The preparation work  The time  The stripping 
[01:44:30]  Of the building  All right  The pulling of  Beams with a come along  How do you do that  In an office building  Well okay  All your four main  Structured beams  Were severed  Perfectly towards  The inside  That's what you do  With a shape charge  So it doesn't blow up  Outside  Where did this happen  Right in those buildings  But how do they get it done  Without anyone noticing  The work that was  Well if you check on it  You'll find out  That there were floors  Shut down weeks  Prior to for maintenance work  Where people were told  Not to come into work 
[01:45:00]  That day  Because they couldn't  Get to their floor  That day  Maintenance was going on  My next point is this  How do two planes  Drop three buildings  World Trade Center  Building seven  Fifty one stories high  Have you ever seen  The tape of it  Oh yeah yeah  It imploded into  Its own footprint  I did  Now they tell us  That happened from  Debris  Debris hitting it  When two 100 story  Buildings fall  You're going to get  Unprecedented debris  Yeah  Powdered debris  Explain that to me too  Why when they fell 
[01:45:30]  Was all the cement  Blowing to dust  It was powder  Remember the massive  Powder  Wouldn't it come down  In big chunks  It did come down  In big chunks  There were  Some of the upper parts  It did  Where did all this  Powder come from then  All this powder  This  And look  Maybe what was  Inside the building  That was cement  The way the towers  Were built  Obviously the metal  Outer structure  And then the inner  Structure was the  Cement floors  Those powdered  The metal  Structures went out  If you watch  The tapes  You can see them 
[01:46:00]  Peeling like a banana  Peel out to the sides  That debris  Wrecked a lot of  The buildings down there  Made one of them  Look like it had  A claw mark  I was there  A week after  Yeah  I was too  We all were  But I mean  I walked the site  When they had it  All four  We got the inside  Scoop  All right  Then here's another  Question I have  How could there be  Molten metal  Then under the building  Which stopped the digging  Because they said  That they couldn't dig  In certain spots  Because of molten 
[01:46:30]  Still fires burning  Yeah  If the fires happened  Way up a hundred floors  In the air  How could there be  Molten metal down below  Well wasn't there  A blowout from  First of all  When the buildings fell  I imagine the fire  Didn't stay up there  In mid air  And also  And they were brutal fires  Because never before  Has a fire dropped  A steel structured building  That handles the history  But also wasn't  Yeah but also  We never had an explosion  Like that to watch  In an office building  That was constructed  Like that  And also remember  To answer your question  Hold on  About the fire in the bottom 
[01:47:00]  It was also  Didn't you see the footage  That was made by  Those French documentary guys  There was fire down  In the basement  Because the engine  And stuff came down  Through the elevator  There were a lot of  Flammable materials  The only problem was  The elevator shafts  Were sealed  They always are  So the fire's not  Going to go down  The shafts  No but the flaming  The flaming engine  Or flaming piece  Of the plane wrecked  A lot of fuel  Went down there too  Yeah  Really I think  Most of the fuel  Went on the initial contact  When you saw that  Huge explosion  There went all your fuel  What did he say 
[01:47:30]  You know  You're getting like Hollywood  You never run out of bullets  I'm just  You know in Hollywood  When you have a gunfight  Isn't it neat  How they never run out of bullets  Where in reality  You've got to carry it all yourself  But Jesse  What about the path  Of least resistance  What about looking at this  As an objective person  And saying  I am  There were extremists  That despise us  As a country  Whether their reasons  Are valid or not  I'm not even getting into that  But they despise us  As a country 
[01:48:00]  They came up with a great plan  And kicked our ass  Yes  They defeated our  Multi-billion dollar  Air defense system  They did  Unfortunately  Time out now  Now I'm going to ask  This question  Okay  In my line of work  In the Navy  In the SEALs  You're not given  The opportunity to fail  Right  Mm-hmm  All right  9-11  4,000 people  Died that day  If you recall  A few months ago  Do you remember  When they moved  Those nuclear warheads  From North Dakota  Down to like Louisiana 
[01:48:30]  Whatever it was  And they violated  A bunch of security stuff  Well I read  Two weeks later  70 people  Lost their jobs  Over that  Now with this huge  Massive failure  Of our air defense system  Why was no one fired  Because the people  Who allowed it to happen  Unfortunately  Were the captains  Who opened the door  And got their throats cut  Did they really violate  The air defense system  Yes  Yes  Time  Time  Time  No no no  You can't  No no  They were commercial airliners 
[01:49:00]  Wait  How did they violate  The air defense system  Simple  Because you remember  When Payne Stewart died  The golfer  Yes  He took off from Florida  In a private jet  Not even a public one  A private jet  They lost contact with him  Within 20 minutes  They had a fighter jet  Up on the wing  The fighter pilot  Looked inside  Saw them all slumped over  Couldn't raise them  And said I believe  They're all dead  Stayed with them  Until they went up  Into Dakota  Or whatever 
[01:49:30]  Had they going to  Hit Omaha  He'd have blasted  Them out of the air  But they didn't  They went down  In a field  Here you had  Here's the failure  You had four  Commercial airliners  All hijacked  An hour apart  And not one of our jets  Ever made it up  Into the air  Not one jet  Got up there  That is a massive  Failure  And you can try  To out yell me  There is your failure  It's not out yelling you  But you ask a question  You throw a question out  And I try to answer  Or at least speculate  And then you go  Okay time  And you just barrel over it 
[01:50:00]  It's like that's not right  We can all just ask questions  That don't have an answer to them  I don't know why nobody was fired  But because I don't know  Who was fired  Or why they weren't fired  That does not mean  That the government  Set up 9-11  And I didn't see  What I thought I saw  Jim the reason why  They weren't  I know why they weren't fired  I know why they weren't fired  I actually talked to  An American airline pilot  Two days after it happened  And it was protocol  They had to negotiate  With terrorists  Anybody who was going  To take over the plane  They had to go out  And talk to them  And try to negotiate 
[01:50:30]  To get the plane down  And keep everybody safe  That's what they were  Supposed to do  They weren't  Now it's lock the door  Nobody gets in  We drop the plane  I'm not even talking  About that  I'm talking about  Our air defense  Our air defense  Right right  Why weren't there  Where were they  They totally  And 70 people  Lost their jobs  And were demoted  Over this little spectacle  In North Dakota  This one  Nobody lost their job  Why?  Well if you start  Firing people  Then there's going to be 
[01:51:00]  Investigations  Aren't there  But if you don't  Fire anybody  Business as usual  Everything moves  Right along  So you think  That the supervisors  Knew  That commercial airliners  Were by our government  Were being flown  Into buildings  Through this whole thing  Or just  But they knew  They were hijacked  I've been there  So why didn't  I've been there  And I've watched  Air controllers  Every plane in America  Has people watching it  At every second  These planes went out  And made U-turns  Over Ohio  And all that  And started heading  Back this way 
[01:51:30]  Where was the bells?  All they got to do  Is say  We got a plane  That's way off course  First of all  There was no thing  We're hijacking this plane  Well wait a minute  No one could believe it  Because we were all  Doing war ops  Up in Alaska  At that time  The air traffic controllers  Couldn't believe  The flight pattern  They didn't know  Exactly what was happening  No one said  This is a hijacked plane  This is what we want  So all they did was  They lost communication  With pilots  They saw them  Flying erratically  And all of a sudden  One hits the building 
[01:52:00]  And then X amount  Of minutes later  The other one  Hits the building  An hour later  Okay whatever  But what does that mean  An hour later  So what does that mean?  What do you think happened?  That means that somebody  Had people standing down  That's JFK  Oliver Stone  Terminology  But I'm saying  Stand down  So the government  Called the military  Have you been in the military?  No no no  But what I'm saying is  I'm asking you  Have you been in the military?  And I'm telling you no  Okay then you don't know  But I know stand down  Is a real term  But I'm saying  That was from the movie JFK  Someone said stand down 
[01:52:30]  So do you really think  Someone called and said  Stand down  You can't keep a secret  Between ten people  But all of a sudden  This massive thing  That killed 4,000 citizens  Everyone's willing  To keep quiet about  No no no  Let's all  Okay I'll counter that  With you by saying  What was Adolf Hitler's  Greatest quote?  The bigger the lie  The easier the sound  That's great  But that is not  Relevant to this  No it isn't  No it's not  So if this isn't a lie  You couldn't keep  Tailhook  What was the one  With the sexual scale  Nothing is kept quiet  Adolf Hitler didn't have  The internet working against him 
[01:53:00]  Adolf Hitler didn't have  Digital cameras  You couldn't keep  Abu Ghraib quiet  Abu Ghraib brought down  The whole thing  Because the digital camera  Was sent over the internet  Times are different  Information is transferred  Differently than it was  Back then with Hitler  That's not an accurate  It would be very difficult  To keep something  This magnitude quiet  There's so many people  That would have to be involved  What about  What about  What about  On the local level  What about  The Air National Guard  At the local level  That it doesn't go  All the way up  To the top 
[01:53:30]  To the conspirators  No yes it does  And they say  Yes it does  They say  Don't follow these planes  Or don't even  Don't even take off  Okay let's say  You guys are correct  And it's all real  Still somebody  Should have been fired  Okay  Not going to argue that  Maybe you're right  If what you're telling me  Is all real  Someone should have  Still lost their job  Do you think  Because our  Multi-billion dollar  Air defense system  Failed miserably  Do you think  It's reasonable to assume 
[01:54:00]  People weren't fired  Because the focus  And I'm not saying  This is right either  But this is a little  More acceptable to me  That the focus  Wasn't to be put  On people that  F'd up here  In this country  But the focus  Was to be put  On the Islamic  Militant  Fanatics  That did this  To us  Instead  Why sit around  And start firing  And blaming people  For our lack  Of security  When the focal point  Is the hatred  That these people 
[01:54:30]  Had for us  And you know what  I remember back  And how old are you  I'm 44  Okay you're a little  You're a little light  But I remember back  When I was  Trying to get laid  By younger women here  When I was  When I was a young  Teenager  And they told me  Lyndon Johnson  Got on television  And said  Our boys are  Floating in the water  I remember  When they told us  About the Gulf  Of Tonkin incident  When they told us  That North Vietnam  Had fired upon  Two of our ships  And that was 
[01:55:00]  The declaration of war  That got us  Into the Vietnam war  Now a couple years  Years ago I was teaching  At Harvard  And McNamara  Who was I believe  Secretary of State  Or one of them  At that time  He's now going around  With the new film  The fog of war  And he's admitted  The Gulf of Tonkin  Incident never happened  Now 58,000 of my generation  Were killed in Vietnam  Over an incident  That was made up  It never happened  Now do you think  That do you now understand 
[01:55:30]  Why maybe I don't  Trust my government  Yes  No one is saying  That the government  Should be trusted blindly  And no one is saying  That they're not garbage  On almost every level  I'm talking about this  And it's not  Well and again  It's not some blind trust  But you're a common sense guy  You're a common sense guy  And yet  Common sense  If they were going to do this  I mean  Why not consider it  Why would you go through  All of the possible things  That could go wrong  If you can get people  Out of their offices  And do all this  And plant these  Why wouldn't you  Just go through the basement 
[01:56:00]  And do it properly  And kill a tremendous amount  More people  And then it's just  A little bit easier  Why go through all  Of the nonsense  And the voice mechanisms  That cover people  Calling their relatives  And all of the possible ways  For a snafu to occur  As opposed to two  Massively loaded  Properly wired trucks  In each basement  You take one building down  You take the other building down  They fall completely  Into New York City  You kill a lot more people  And there's no planes  To deal with  There's no air defense  To deal with  I mean  As a common sense guy 
[01:56:30]  And if you're that  And by the way  If the government  Is that effective  At doing all this stuff  How could they not  They left Colin Powell  Swinging in the wind  Looking like a moron  Saying there's uranium  I mean  How would they allow  Such an obvious one  To go on  I don't know  All I can say is  That  And I have no background  That you guys have  Certainly  As a Navy SEAL  No that's not about that  That's not about it  Wait a minute  He is a SEAL  I'm not saying that  Let me finish  Do you remember  Iran Contra  No I was too busy 
[01:57:00]  Just being a dummy  Who ran around  Not knowing anything  About the military  What is that  Was that a good thing  Did our government do good  Iran Contra  I don't know  Is that a guy's name  Is he a movie star  Well  Hey you're comedy too  Yes that's what I do  But if you'll let me finish  I know you're a Navy SEAL  Wait I'm answering your question  But you're not  You're saying I'm not a Navy SEAL  What's that got to do with it  You're pointing out  That I'm not a Navy SEAL  I know that  I'm talking to you  You know Iran Contra  Yes  No he doesn't  You're telling me  That everybody knows  Right  Well I had a good friend  Of mine that I served  With in the SEAL team 
[01:57:30]  Who came back  As an officer  He ended up  On SEAL team 6  With Dick Marcinko  The anti-terrorist  SEAL unit  Right  He was sitting at home  Watching television  When Iran Contra broke  And he perked up  And said wow  I was part of that  See everything  Is compartmentalized  In the government  A doesn't know  What B is always doing  Because you're given  An order  And you're given  An order  Okay you're going  To take this  From point A to point B  That's all you know 
[01:58:00]  You know what  You don't know  The big picture  Okay  You're just operational  At operational level  Doing things  That you're made to do  I understand  That this gentleman  Was a member  Of SEAL team 6  Who was part of  He had no idea  He was part of  Arms for hostages  He was given a job  To deliver something  From point A  To point B  And then when it broke  He then went  Wow  I was part of that  Now would he then  Admit to that  No he wouldn't  Let me tell you  The difference  Not to regular people  Because it was  An illegal activity  Right  And if he admitted 
[01:58:30]  To that  He possibly could  Have faced charges  Let me tell you  The big difference though  And your  I'm sure you will  Your military experience  Does come into play  When you're talking  About things like  The Gulf of Tonkin  Yes  And Iran Contra  Absolutely  I'll agree with that  But those two incidents  Also were  Completely military  Completely military  Which if you ask me  It's a lot easier  To deal with  And keep quiet  Than  Airliners  That are full of civilians 
[01:59:00]  Yeah  You gotta bring in  Terrorists  Who would admit to it  It's mass murder  Someone's going to admit  To be part of  Somebody would talk about it  When you start involving  Massive amounts of civilians  You guys are right  And commercial aircraft  You've won me over  We weren't trying  To win you over  You won't address  You ran right over  The possible  As a common sense guy  And you are a common sense dude  No I'm not  I'm a radical  You won't look at why  They wouldn't go  Through the basement  That's a valid question  You're asking a lot of questions 
[01:59:30]  And I'm asking  A common sense question  I can't answer why  They wouldn't go  Through the basement  Doesn't that as a smart guy  Make any sense  Sure  Why wouldn't they  It's other options  But it's an option  That was very hard  And you're now telling me  That they should have  Done it this way  Even though they were  Successful the way  They did do it  Then why would they  Have to do it your way  When they were already  Successful my way  Come on now  That's cheating  I don't think they were  Successful because  I don't believe it happened  So I'm playing the same game  I'm being speculative  It did happen  Why can't you believe  It was just terrorists  I can  You can't 
[02:00:00]  But I believe  We were complacent  Yeah okay  Complacent  I believe we were ignorant  I believe we were complacent  I believe we were careless  I believe we thought  We were untouchable  It could be beyond that  I don't believe  You don't believe  That like the Gulf of Tonkin incident  That we would orchestrate  You don't believe  The Rookstag fire  Back in Germany  Where the Nazis  Blamed the communists  To get the country  In an uproar  To go to war  And then later  They found out  That it was the Nazis  Who did it  What's the end game  What's the end game 
[02:00:30]  Of the government thing  What did we want  The end game  Is controlling the oil  In the Middle East  So we wanted to go  Into the Middle East  Don't you think  It would have been  A lot simpler  To come up with some  Weapons of mass destruction  And how about  We put a few of them  Thousands of miles away  From the media  And everything else  And say  Look what we found  Here's our reason  To go in  We were having him  Under sanctions  For years  We were still  Flying over his country  And not allowing planes  To fly there  We could have done  Anything we wanted  And said he did 
[02:01:00]  Anything we said he did  To get our people  Into Iraq  Yet this huge scheme  Has to come out  You're right  We kill civilians  You're right  You're right  You needed everybody  You're right  You needed the whole country  Behind them  Democrats and Republicans  The country was  We loved beating up Iraq  Who didn't love  Go for one  It was like the godfather  I wanted part two  No after September 11th  You didn't like the first one  You're wrong  Anthony  Where they invaded Kuwait  I'm not saying  On a political level  Wait which Kuwait 
[02:01:30]  Used to be part of Iraq  And it was cut out  And made it into  Its own country  So you believe  Saddam was entitled  To annex Kuwait  You know I got  I got plenty of weird things  Not that I care  Again  I could care less  Well I also  You know  Believe the pilgrims  Didn't have visas  And now  And now we require them  Okay fair enough  Wait are you for open borders  Yeah  Wow you are crazy  Jesus Christ  Jesse  How can the hell  That's what we're living 
[02:02:00]  I don't prefer living  In East Berlin  Clearly you guys  Like East Berlin  Yeah because in East Berlin  You can come and go  As you please  It's the same thing  As being here  And put a big fence  Around our country  And we're the epitome  Of freedom  And yet  Our country is the most  Difficult country  To travel in now  Go get  You know  After September 11th  Yes  We're supposed to be  The country of freedom  And we were  And 19 guys came in  Because this is the problem  With the communication  And you're right  And they came in  From where  The FBI and the CIA  Probably through Canada  So we're putting 
[02:02:30]  A fence on Mexico  Hey  You know  That seems logical  I'll agree with you there  That seems logical  As hell  I'll agree with you there  You know  Let's build a fence  At Mexico  Even though they came in  From Canada  Well that'll stop them  Next time  Well I don't think  We'll build a fence  At Mexico  Yeah look  Alright  Good point  Good point  That's a dumb thing  It is hypocritical  But that doesn't explain  And you're right  About so many things  About the government  Being dirty  But all of that  Doesn't explain  How this  You're right  You've convinced me 
[02:03:00]  It's everything  That the government  Told me  No  No  I'm agreeing with you  It's everything  They've told us  I shouldn't even  Ask a question  No one's saying  Why do you say  No one's saying  You ask a question  No one is saying  I'm agreeing with you  Why are you fighting  With me  No you're not  You've convinced me  Alright good  I like that  You've convinced me  We're good at sarcasm  That my government  Would never lie to me  My government  Oh now  You're being silly Jess  Oh I'm not  Jess you're being a goose  My country right or wrong  Absolutely  It certainly is 
[02:03:30]  You know what  Wait a minute  No  Wait a minute  You know what  You guys need to listen to  Yes but I waited  Okay  Who said the quote  Dissension is the greatest  Form of patriotism  Bush in the planning room  When he was going  And you do the voice tracking  That makes their own families  Think it's them  Yeah I'm that stupid  No no  Me too  Because I think the government  Is always right  I asked you a legitimate question  I've been asking it to you too  And you keep telling me  I'm not a Navy SEAL  I don't know  Obviously  Or I would tell you  I would love to be able 
[02:04:00]  To just shut you down  With a brilliant answer  But I don't know  Who said that quote  I don't know  Jesse Ventura  Doesn't matter  You're fine  But I don't know  Who said the quote  I'm in it  You convinced me  I don't know  Who said the quote  Jesse why are you getting  So frustrated  I'm not  I don't get frustrated  You'll learn something  About us  Than my unit  We don't get mad  We get even  Jesus Christ  We're all getting  Our throats slit tonight  And always remember  You have to sleep sometimes  Oh Jesus 
[02:04:30]  Especially you  You can't slice Jimmy's neck  You don't know where it is  You'll hit his chin  Good luck finding my chin  You've asked questions  And I've asked questions  I mean it's like  Why is it that  When you're asking questions  That are speculative  And I ask a question  You get angry  Why are you getting angry  Why are you moving the microphone  I'm not angry  I'm listening  Well  No you just moved the microphone  Because I have nothing to say  I'm listening  He's convinced  We finally flipped him  We got him  I don't think I've convinced you  But I do think  There are some ballot points 
[02:05:00]  That you're thinking of  I'm sure you're not convinced  No you've convinced me  But no one is saying  The government's always honest  No one is saying  Yes they are  My country right or wrong  No not black or white here  We're not talking  There's a grey area  But I think you're way over  To one side of this grey area now  And we're on the other side  I think we can agree  That our government  Has been dishonest in the past  Absolutely  It's been proven  But to use that  As some kind of cornerstone  To this conspiracy theory  On 9-11 
[02:05:30]  Doesn't make sense  It's  Yeah it's just  It's like  Back when I grew up  In the 60's  The only type of assassinations  Were all lone nuts  There was never ever  Another person involved  In any of the assassinations  Of the 60's  You had a lone nut  Kill JFK  You had a lone nut  Kill Martin Luther King  You had a lone nut  Kill Robert F. Kennedy  And Malcolm X  Yeah another lone nut  A couple of lone nuts  No that was a conspiracy 
[02:06:00]  Because there was more than one  The others were simply  Single  All of them single  What about the lone nut  That tried to kill  Gerald Ford  Squeaky Fromm  What about the lone nut  That tried to kill Reagan  Wait wait wait  There were two  Sandra Good was with her  So that was more than one  She had the gun  That was more than one  Alright Hinkley  What about Hinkley  Yeah  I mean  There's never been  What about Caesar  You're going back  A little bit  What did Castro say to you  About the FK  What did Castro say to you  About the FK  Castro told me  That it was an inside job 
[02:06:30]  He said that Oswald  Could not make the shots  He said that the Russians  Did not want Kennedy dead  At that time  Because he was very close  To them  And in fact  Their quote to him  About Kennedy was  You can talk to this man  He said he didn't do it  Because he said  Do I look suicidal  He said I love my country  Very much  And if I would have did it  My country would have been  Wiped off the face of the earth  He also told me  That at the time  That it happened 
[02:07:00]  That Kennedy had sent  A writer from Paris  Named Gene Daniel  To meet with Castro  And Daniel was setting up  A secret meeting  Between the two of them  And Castro felt very strong  That Kennedy may change  The policy of the United States  Towards Cuba  And you know  But this is naturally  Only Fidel's version of it  And had Kennedy done that  I'm sure there would have been  A lot of angry people  In this country  Who still believe 
[02:07:30]  That we should have  This policy  I find it very interesting  That we will trade  Unlimited with China  Who is communist  I agree with this  Wholeheartedly  And yet Cuba  We don't  But I know the answer  Why?  Well the answer is  Truly very simple  When Castro came in  He threw out  All of our corporations  China's welcoming  Our corporations  So there's your example  If you welcome  Corporate America  Corporate America  Will wheel and deal 
[02:08:00]  With you all you want  But if you don't  Welcome corporate America  Then you get  You know  Boyd  I think China's  Human rights record  Is abysmal  It's just  And why we have  Any kind of relationship  With them is beyond me  I think the Cuban  Problem also  Is the fact that  They're just  Holding a grudge  Against Fidel  I think there's  An actual grudge  That you know  This guy  Was the last  Communist holdout  I can't believe  Our country  Would do that  I could 
[02:08:30]  Not our country  Absolutely not  We would never  Hold the grudge  No sir  We're perfect  We don't ever  Tell lies  Apple pie  And baseball  Ladies and germs  Because that's  What I believe  That's right  That's what I believe  It's all juggling  And smiles  And mom picks you  On the cheek  I don't think  They ever said  Nothing wrong  No sirree bob  I agree with you  They're terrific  We have to take a break  George Bush won  Fair and square  I think we have to  Agree to disagree  On this one  Yeah we might have to  No you've convinced me  We don't think 
[02:09:00]  We know sarcasm  Sir  I won't ask  Another question  About it  I got it  Straight right here  Neither will I  I'm fine  That's right  If you're going  To ask the question  Just remember  Basement  Basement  Why not the basement  That's a good  Question to ask  I guess you're  An experienced guy  That would know that  Not just common sense  Like you said  You use common sense  And I ain't no Navy SEAL  But I have common sense too  And it does tell  That if you're going  To go through 500 steps  I can look at you  And know you're not  I'm a small  Wimpy guy  Small wimpy guy  But you know  What we're good for 
[02:09:30]  Using our heads  You know while I was  Sitting around  Just being an overfed  Little fat boy  I used my head  And I thought  Common sense things  All day  He kind of looks  Like a SEAL  If you look at him  If you throw a ball  He'll actually  Bounce it on his nose  Alright listen  The book is  Bobby piling on  What are you going to do  I don't want to get beat up  The book is  Don't start the revolution  Without me  It leads off  Where what  Following your life  As the governor 
[02:10:00]  Of Minnesota  And his decisions  To leave politics  After his first term  Right  Not really  The book is about  Alright well  I'm not summarizing  You're somewhat right  I finally talked  The first time  In 20 minutes  But the actual book  Is like  One thing is wrong  I take you on a trip  With me from Minneapolis  Down to the Baja  There you go  Okay  And then along the way  Of course  Do we have to talk  The things  And whatever  You know  But it just leads me  Into many political things  That I think about 
[02:10:30]  On a daily basis  That you know  About our country  And all that stuff  And you really need  To understand too  Guys that I'm not  Very patriotic  My mother was  A World War II vet  My father was  A World War II vet  And my brother and I  Are Vietnam vets  But we're not a patriot  I think blind patriotism  Is one of the most  Dangerous things ever  Absolutely  And I don't agree  Or believe  Everything the government  Throws out at us  But there are certain things  That I think 
[02:11:00]  Can be looked at  With common sense  And using your own head  And that's where  I stand on the whole thing  Jesse you're  A very interesting guy  Love having you on the show  I love when Jimmy  Gets so impassioned  Because  Well we don't agree on something  This will bug the crap  Out of him for weeks  And anything that bothers Jimmy  We love  He's won me over man  See  With his common sense  And his knowledge  Of everything  Hey  You won me over too  I mean look  Something happened in 1960  And that's exactly the same thing  That happened in 2001 
[02:11:30]  I mean I can agree with that  Well remember  History repeats itself  Quite often  Absolutely  If you ever tried reading  No I don't read at all  I don't read  Well then you'd know  I watch TV  There you go  And they tell me  What's going on  And I go  Well that's that  There you go  That's what I do  Yes there you go  Oh my god  I don't write neither  I got a crayon  Can I ask you something  Sure can  How many books  Did you read last winter  Not many  I was writing one  Oh  Space  Great 
[02:12:00]  Well I wrote one  And read 16  I don't know  But it was about me  On that time  Good for you  It was about me  Plus I do five hours  Of radio a day  No time to read  Balls in your court  You read 16  Alright  What kind of books  Were they  Plus I don't believe  Everything I read  So apparently  You believe everything  You read  I don't  I watch  I'm glad you think  For me too  I do  Why not  Absolutely  I'm not an ABC  I can't fight for you  So I might as well  Think for you  Because that's what  Short little nobodies do  You just sit around  And think all day  I want to see him  Do that thing  Where he grabs  Jimmy's head  And just goes  I'd prefer  I'd prefer not to see that 
[02:12:30]  Anthony  Anthony  Can you not say that  Hey Jesse  I just want to let  By the way  I was also a bestseller  I'm sure not as high  On the list as you were  But I was also  A non-fiction bestseller  So that's what I was  Doing last winter  To kind of counteract  Your implication  That I'm an ass  Who doesn't read  I was doing that  You're writing your  He's an ass  That does read  Yeah  Well like I said  I did mine  And read 16  Alright well you did more  So point Jesse  But you asked me  How many I read  But then again  I live where I don't  Have a TV  So that helped too  Okay well if you did  Maybe we'd have  A different argument  Like maybe you'd watch  Some of the footage 
[02:13:00]  Over and over  And go oh yeah  That's kind of what happened  I wrote a blog  In my MySpace  What happened to TV  Doesn't make you smarter though  You miss a lot of good shows  The Wire  I recommend it higher  Amazing  Alright we gotta go  We gotta take a break here  Jesse thanks man  You are  I'm done  You guys told me  I'd have the whole hour  I say you stay  Well yeah  Well we've run out of show though  Let's go to other topics  You know you guys  Got me off on that one  And kind of me  That's that  Alright good  There's plenty other topics  We've run out of show over here  But you can join us over at XM  No problem  Then we'll really  I got other commitments 
[02:13:30]  And then we'll curse it  We'll start cursing over there  Let me plug real quick  The book signings he has  Jesse has two book signings  He has one  Today's the 8th  The 10th is 6.30pm  It's at bookends  It's a great bookstore  In Ridgewood, New Jersey  You can fit a lot of people in there  And then April 11th  The next night  Is very accessible from New York  Barnes & Noble  On Route 3 East  In Clifton  It's at 7.30pm  So you got time to go there  After work  So you got two shots  Over the next few days  To go and get your book signed  And it's called  Don't Start the Revolution Without Me 
[02:14:00]  Jesse's obviously a radical thinker  And obviously a good writer  It's kind of weird  That you would plug him  Because he doesn't like you right now  You can get into a nice heated dispute  I like him  You can respect each other  And have a heated dispute  I like it  He's convinced me  Alright  There is a little bit of truth in that  He doesn't want to admit it  But there's a little bit of truth  I raised questions he didn't like  And that's the problem  And I did two  That you didn't like  I didn't  Are you guys  None  Not a one  We gotta take a break  This is scary  In case you're wondering 
[02:14:30]  It continues during the break  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show  Pretty much just to say goodbye  Because we're really really late  I want to thank Robert Kelly  For stopping in  His Just a Tip CD slash DVD  Is out in stores right now  And you can get it through  Amazon.com as well 
[02:15:00]  Yes Jimmy  I will be in Detroit this Saturday  I thought you were going to  Plug my CD for me  Yeah yeah  I'll be selling it  Clutch Cargo's in Detroit  This Saturday night  And then Caroline's  The 17th through the 20th  Here in New York  You'll convince me  To buy that CD  I would say  The 17th through the 20th  Caroline's  Can you plug  Mike Bibigley is dumb DVD  You won't even give me  One of your best friends a shot  Oh what'd you do  I'm sorry  I got it Jimmy  Why am I dealing  Just talk to me  I apologize  I should have just looked at you 
[02:15:30]  Yeah Scott Martin writes  Okay Jimmy stood  Toe to toe with Chris Jericho  And now Jesse Ventura  Sam should give him  His championship belt  Sam didn't exactly earn it  Just amazing radio Jimmy  Absolutely amazing  Jesse's now talking to Anthony  I think he's turning Anthony  A little bit  Anthony's he turning you  A little bit  Sure is  I'm done  I'm turned  No he's done  He's convinced  Good night Jeff  I'm turned  Yeah  Okay  Ah he got me  I said good night  He was right  It was morning  He would love to bash 
[02:16:00]  My fat little face  Alpha males hate me  I wouldn't waste my time  I know you wouldn't  Oh Jesus  Not that it would be  A big time consumer  One good slap  Alpha males don't like it  Because they used to  Overtalk everybody  Huh  Thanks guys  Alright Jesse  Bye Jesse  Go ahead either way  Officially on the air now  And say you've convinced me completely  You said it  That's all I get to hear  When I convinced you  That's cool  Attaboy  I like that  Hannity and Combs tonight right  Give you a little plug for that  Yes  Yeah we  We're friends with Sean Hannity  So Hannity and Combs 
[02:16:30]  I can figure you probably were  Yes  Woo  We believe everything he says  To pal  Actually I don't really agree  With his politics  I just like the guy  I agree with his politics too  Yeah  He does  He changed me  He really  He really is going to squeeze  Jimmy like a stress doll  Big deal  Look at Jimmy  Big deal  I'm not going to trash the guy  Because he's not here  I will say this  Like I have tremendous respect  For his military  And I believe a lot of what he said  It's almost like  Don't use the fact that  You're a Navy SEAL  And I'm not  Because I  To say  With a basement argument 
[02:17:00]  Like no one is questioning that  No one is  I mean I'm so pro-military  My father's military  I'm so pro-military  It's embarrassing  Right  So it's like  You don't need to use that  As a weapon against me  I'm not claiming that knowledge  There was a moment there  Where he really wanted  To choke you out  Big deal  You know what  I'm just saying  You're right  His observations here  And Jimmy  I was actually giving you a compliment  That didn't scare you  In the least  Which I thought was really cool  Because he gave you  The look of death  That annoyed me  When he said that  You guys got to sleep eventually  We all went 
[02:17:30]  Oh  Big deal  He's a big guy  And I don't pick stuff  With big guys  But for real  I don't start stuff  With big guys  I don't want to get  Kicked in  He's coming back  He's coming back  No I'm joking  In something like that  It's like come on man  If you want to debate  We're going to be intellectual  I'm not going to ever be  Back on  Look you're right  It wasn't going to get physical at all  You guys were just going back and forth  I'm not fighting the guy  I mean his technique of argument  You know  Guys do get like that  Like they try to intimidate you  With their bigness  But  Impossible  However if we were in a bar 
[02:18:00]  And he hit on my girlfriend  I would take her panties off for him  I'm not an idiot  You know what the thing is also  You almost forget  He was  In the WWF  Yeah  He's a wrestler  And he  He kind of still has  That character  Of a wrestler  Which is  You know  Hey  You convinced me  Good  You know  And then that  Give and take  Kind of back and forth thing  Well they  They used to actually  I mean  Kai liked that  If you disagreed  You had an argument  You would smack the guy 
[02:18:30]  In the head  And go at it  Hit you with a chair  Yeah that's kind of what they did  You know  And Jimmy would actually just  You know  Go down  I'm not saying  He isn't passionate  And believes in what he believes  Which to me  That's fine  Right  That's fine  Believe what you want to believe  And stuff  But don't  Then don't put us  On some  Like far out ledge  That we believe everything  It's like  Just like he has questions  And probably doesn't believe  Everything  With this whole conspiracy thing  We  I'm not saying  The government is completely 
[02:19:00]  Honest with everything either  Including 9-11  But  You know  We just disagree  Wholeheartedly  On the methods used  To get us into the Middle East  And also  That argument  Instead of going  Okay that's a valid  This is what bugged me  Instead of going  On a valid point  Like you know  That's a valid point  Maybe I could consider that  It became  You've convinced me  It's like you think  I've never argued  And I don't know  Arguing technique  Stop it  You argue a lot  I'm not going to  I've got to say  Jimmy did stick up to him  But every time he did  Give a line  He gave it to Anthony  Instead of looking him  Directly in the eye  To Jesse 
[02:19:30]  Yeah  That's not true  At all  Jesse looked Jimmy right  Oh yeah  I was just kidding  I want to apologize  To the fine people  That listen to us  And watch us on Pal Talk  Because it crashed  During that  So  Well there's a lot of people  Want to check it out  Yeah I know  Yeah  However I would suggest the book  It's obviously he's a controversial dude  Oh yeah  He's a best selling author  And he served this country  Certainly a brave man  Yeah  Nothing bad to say about him  As a guy  And an entertaining wrestler  Yes  And he's apparently a good governor  He needs new jeans though  Yes he does 
[02:20:00]  You notice that too  Don't start the revolution without me  It's on sale now  He had very old faded jeans on  I can't trust a guy  That has very old faded jeans on  When you see those jeans  Coming towards the bridge of your nose  With a leg drop  It got pretty exciting in here today  Yes sir Bob  I'm going to be in Houston Improv this weekend  And today my CD comes out in stores  Yes  Yeah we really are pushing Bobby's CD big time  Robert Kelly just the tip  Make sure you go and buy that 
[02:20:30]  You want a lot of people to buy it today  I want them to go buy it  Because yeah  You know  They think I'm going to sell like 200 copies  I'd love to really stick it to Comedy Central  Also comes with a DVD  And look as much as we tease Bob  He's a good comic  And it's a great package dude  The cover is cool  All the stuff inside of it  Just get it man  Help Bobby out  Because it's worth it  Alright I want to apologize to the affiliates  But when you got radio like that  You can't stop it  In the middle  Because then you're going to lose all the steam of  The tension 
[02:21:00]  You know it was so intense  The tension  The tension  You're going to lose the argument  It all just goes away  If you break in the middle that sweet  I'll tell you one thing  So we really messed up all the affiliates  Because they have to  They have to do another commercial break  So I apologize  But I hope it was worth it  We'll see you guys tomorrow  We're off to XM  Bye  The Opie and Anthony Show  XM 202  In the world of Radio Shock Shots  The biggest are Opie and Anthony  These people say shocking things 
[02:21:30]  That border on offensive  In order to entertain their office  I refuse to sit here  And think that radio has to be nice  Why?  Why does radio  Out of any other medium  Have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard  Where we have to be nice  And make people feel good  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys  Opie and Anthony  Controversial radio personalities  Opie and Anthony  Infamous DJs  Opie and Anthony  Talk show radio hosts  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Radio Shock Shots 
[02:22:00]  Opie and Anthony  I go into her room  And there are panties on the floor  Oh you're getting creepy  I had to pick up the panties  And put them on  I can't believe he said that  I didn't know some  Opie and Anthony  Cat shovel baseball  Oh nice  Oh that was him  I didn't hit him hard enough  Opie and Anthony  Terry Shivo 
[02:22:30]  I loved you in the grudge  Will you be doing more voiceover work?  This is the worst  The worst show I've  This is the worst show I've ever been on  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  I want to start the show by saying this  Actually Doug B  I agree with you  He's writing us some feedback from work  I do believe that Rick Delgado was right  And that Jimmy Norton does wreck 
[02:23:00]  The Opie and Anthony Shock  Wow  Now that's saying something  Jimmy you were amazing  Oh thanks man  Thank you  I'm kind of depressed  Because I like Jesse Ventura  I still like Jesse Ventura  But I'm just amazed  That a guy that is as bright as he is  Just believes  Believes what he believes  I'm just amazed actually  Because when we were preparing  For the Jesse Ventura interview  It started being thrown around 
[02:23:30]  That the guy believes  That we  Meaning our government  Took down the buildings  On 9-11  And we're like  Nah it's gotta be like a typo  We're not reading this right  And then we did more research  Obviously  And we're like  No he really believes  You know  The Loose Change documentary  And all that other  Stuff out there  Yeah  I don't trust  I don't trust the government  I don't  I don't believe the government  Tells us everything  Tells the truth  Of course not  On anywhere near the  Everything  But he claims to be  Asking questions  I'm just asking some questions 
[02:24:00]  But it's like  No you're not  He doesn't want answers  You're vehemently  Agenda driven  And defending  And a lot of those  Vietnam vets  Don't trust the government  With good reason  But that doesn't mean  Just because the government  Is scumbags  That they did this  And military operations  That he brought up  In the past  That the government  Was involved in  Deception  Yeah  That's a lot easier  To pull off  Than so many civilians  Being involved in 9-11  It's so many  Witness  How many people 
[02:24:30]  Witnessed  The Gulf of Tonkin  The ship being  Sunk  How many people  Actually witnessed that  How many people  Witnessed Iran-Contra  Civilians  This was a  Crime  That was witnessed  By millions  Upon millions  Of people  It's  It's unprecedented  Jimmy brought up  A good point too  With today's technology  Everybody has a camera phone  Everybody has a video camera  You can't get away  With anything  Without somebody 
[02:25:00]  Somebody actually  Getting it  On the video  Like this big conspiracy  Is going to be able  To be pulled off  With all the outlets  We have today  To share information  Pictures  Audio  It just doesn't happen  Like that  And in six and a half years  You would think  Someone would have  Come out of the woodwork  And said  Alright look  I gotta finally talk about  One of the passengers  Would come out and say  Look they had  They had us hidden  Jesus Christ  I'm getting tired  Of KFC  That's all they bring us  Aruba stinks  I'm bored  Who would think  You'd get bored 
[02:25:30]  Of Aruba  Was he saying  This wasn't on the air  That he doesn't even believe  That Osama Bin Laden  Is real or something  No he's like  How do you  He was implying  He may work for the CIA  Because he did work  For the CIA  When the Soviets  Were in Afghanistan  We had to align ourselves  With the resistance  Part of that resistance  Was Osama Bin Laden  And the guerrillas  That were fighting the Soviets  Same thing with Iraq  We were pretty much aligned 
[02:26:00]  With Iraq  When they were fighting Iran  Because we didn't like Iran  More than we didn't like Iraq  So that's why  We had to put up  With fighting  A lot of our own weaponry  And Soviet weaponry  When we went into Iraq  It happens  That's cold world  Fucking politics  It's changed  We helped the Taliban  Fight the Russians  Of course  Listen  More importantly  Jeff from PA  Has a question  Yes Jeff  Hey Jimmy  Were you able to get 
[02:26:30]  A picture with  Jesse Ventura  After the interview  No I did it before  Yeah  He would have taken one  After I  He took one with me  After  And he was  A little annoyed with me  But he was really  Pissed with you  I got it  You guys couldn't  I'm sorry  You couldn't see  But he actually  Pushed the microphone  Away from himself  At one point  We mentioned that  Something that has to be said  There are times  We have guests  That come in  And you get a weird vibe  Or you get a weird vibe  Before they even come  To the studio  Just knowing that  It might not go so well  And one of us 
[02:27:00]  Will always go  You might want to  Get your picture  Before they come in  Yeah let's do that  Beforehand  Well he even did it  This time  Because we asked him  To do some  Linus for us  Read a little  You know  Hey you're listening  To Opie and Anthony  Yeah that boy  Crap  Jesse the body  Ventura  Look like we're  Bigger than we are  Yeah  And he went  After the show  After my interview  Did he do it  I don't know  I don't know  Did he  I don't know  Anyone know  I don't think he did  I don't think he did  I don't think he did either  Yeah let's say hi 
[02:27:30]  To Kurt and PA  Kurt  Hey Kurt  I already think  You're a comic genius  But man I have  So much respect  For you  The way you handled  This guy  This guy was a  Fucking governor  How did he handle  Himself in meetings  Did he take his ball  Home and go home  Like that  It was Minnesota though  They're you know  What are you gonna do  You know  And a true Navy SEAL  The way he blabs  That shit out  Most of these guys  Stay quiet  He just brings that  Shit up all the time  Well I wish I would  Have thought of this  Because as a soldier  It's almost like  You were a soldier  How many soldiers  Are gonna be willing  To turn on their 
[02:28:00]  Own countrymen  And just mass murder  Them  I'm not saying  None would be  But the scale  Of that operation  Are you telling me  That there's that many  Dirty fucking soldiers  And stop it  I know too many  Military guys  Yeah I know  You're right  Maybe SEAL guy there  About him  His real service  With the SEALs  Yeah  After that interview  We're walking over to XM  And I decided  That I'm gonna have  A little intelligent conversation  With E-Rock  As we walk  Oh Jesus Christ  By the time we got  Was that a fucking dream  Oh exactly  By the time we got 
[02:28:30]  To the building  I'm like  Why did I even bother  Why did I even bother  I was trying to tell E-Rock  Because he's like  A student of radio  I'm like  Did he see something shiny  That's distracted him  I got a couple yes  And I'm like  Oh you don't even  Get my point  Like there are guys  Like Jesse Ventura  That comes on  To a show like ours  And he just assumes  Because I really believe  This show is way above radio  Way above radio  Other radio shows  But when you get guests  Like Jesse Ventura  They don't  They don't study  The radio business  So he thinks 
[02:29:00]  He's coming in  And he's gonna just be  A slapping whappy show  Yeah he's gonna go  On a slapping whappy show  And get to slap the host  Around a little bit  And overpower the conversation  Is gonna be my way  The highway  And that's it  He didn't realize  He was walking into  A situation where  Two out of the three  Are well versed  On 9-11 stuff  You know  He wasn't gonna be able  To shove his bullshit  Down our throats  And I was trying to make  This point with E-Rock  And he's just like  Yeah  Yeah but another thing though  Well you guys weren't  Attacking him  You weren't attacking him  You weren't attacking him  It was actually 
[02:29:30]  A conversation going  Back and forth  You were bringing up  Your point  And he just  Didn't want to hear it  It was a battle  Of the brains  Basically  Yeah but he  We pride ourselves  We could yell  And scream at someone  Like uh  Like no  You know  Like anyone  But sometimes  Were you gonna say  Nobody's business  I'd rather make  A valid point  I call myself  You asshole  So fuck you  I'd rather make  Valid points  With somebody  Easy Opie  Why don't you  Fucking turn so quick  Also I'll respect  Take one hit  And you just wanna  Stab somebody  In the fucking face  That's a good point  Jesus  Good point  I'll respect  People's opinions 
[02:30:00]  And ideologies  And stuff  Even if I think  They're dopey  Personally  But I will let them  Bring it into  The discussion  And then try to  You know  Dispute it  That's what  Dialogue is  That's what  A conversation is  An argument  Whatever you wanna call it  But when he wasn't  Getting his way  He got really mad  Yeah yeah  He started using  That sarcasm  And then  Well you've convinced me  He actually  Took the microphone  And threw it like this  Yeah he kinda whipped it around  Hey by the way  I gotta mention this  Cause it came in a lot  And I just  I just don't know  I don't have knowledge 
[02:30:30]  On this  I did watch Fog of War  And I wanna watch it again  It was a great  It was an amazing documentary  If you wanna check out  Something different  Judy Osborne  And a bunch of people  Oh  Ventura was wrong  About the Gulf of Tonkin  Our troops were committed  To the Vietnam War  Before the Tonkin incident  JFK had committed  Our troops  Before he was shot  But other people  Are saying  That that wasn't  Admitted  In the documentary  Fog of War  No  No  You have to watch that again  Yeah  I don't 
[02:31:00]  I don't have the knowledge  But a lot of people  It has been  That's bullshit  The point he made  About Fog of War  You know what  I give a lot more credibility  To the fact  That the government  Was involved  In some kind of  Hijinks with that  To get us  Deeper into Vietnam  I know we were involved  Already  But there was a lot of  It was as  Advisors  It was a limited  Amount of troops  And  I know  Johnson really wanted  To throw a shitload  More people in there  But  Yeah but you know  He needed a catalyst 
[02:31:30]  The government  Look  The government  Might have been involved  They might have known about  And maybe let stuff slide  And you know  It could have been like  This could be perfect  Because I don't believe  That they didn't know  That we were going to be  Attacked somewhere  Sometime  By something  You know what I'm saying  I think they  Probably knew  That there was some  Kind of terrorist event  That was going to happen  But in hindsight  You could add everything up  And say yeah  This is great  Look at all the facts  That are here  But the bottom line is  It was so  Un-fucking-real 
[02:32:00]  That something like that  Could possibly happen  The FBI and the CIA  Plus they don't communicate  Yeah  They never communicate  One thing I want to say too  I'm tired of guys doing this  Like Geraldo did it  And he did it  When you have a point of view  Calling you a little worm  Yes then fucking my mouth  Sorry Jimmy  Who said that?  No no  Geraldo got mad at me too  Because I was  I just didn't  I wasn't even coming at him  I just didn't agree with  Everything he was saying  About immigration  And I'm tired  Of these fucking guys  Having these very strong opinions  And then when they're debated on  I didn't say  Fuck you Geraldo 
[02:32:30]  Or fuck you Jack  Right  Like all of a sudden  They feel victimized  And they throw  Stop it motherfucker  They might be getting mad  And they try to just  Toss you aside  Like I  I know I'm a fucking  Well they might be getting mad  Because the way you wear  Your headphones  With your little ears  Sticking out  That might piss them off  You look like a half a retard  Can you put them on both ears  Hold on  Hold on  Let me get in here  Let me get in here  For a second  Because it's worth mentioning  This is why  We truly do love  Our listeners  As much as we  Scream and yell at you  A lot  Dave B from Philly  He writes 
[02:33:00]  Way above radio  What's up east side  Dave's ass  Baby shit mustache  Tongue scrapings  Yeah you guys are  So above and beyond  Well we gotta fill up  All this air time  And something in between  These intelligent  Political debates  Yeah but he's also  Forgetting though  He's also forgetting  Aside from this debate  He's forgetting  A duty hat  Right  Duty hat  And fucking mouse trap  Duty hat  And hot ice on the balls  Yeah Jimmy pudding  Pens up his ass  Because you know  Black girl chews him 
[02:33:30]  I guess we can come up  With a bunch of them  If I see a chewed pen cap  Anyone that does that  In the workplace  I take the pen  And I put it  Into my ass crack  And I put it back  In circulation  Chew that one  Oh god  Hey uh  The other thing  That was very interesting  The Jesse Ventura thing  Started off  It was a  We were all on the same side  To start the interview  And then I saw him  Actually like  Kind of fold his leg  And get comfortable  And he goes  And this is not an 11 thing  He was  He was ready for all of us  To just completely agree  Yeah  And I'm like  Oh boy  You have no idea 
[02:34:00]  What you're getting  Wait till you see  The facts I bring out  On this one  Yeah he goes  It all started with my son  And he told me  Dad you gotta read  This stuff on the internet  And he really thought  The next words out of our mouth  Was oh my god  I'm so with you  Good point  And that's when we said  Woo  Slow down  Good point  Good point  You guys debated this  You know  A few times before  It's not like the first time  You're having this conversation  You've talked in depth  About this  And you  But you guys weren't  You weren't saying  You're wrong  You were actually agreeing  With some of what he said 
[02:34:30]  I know  He is wrong  He is wrong  100%  Whenever they bring up  The point of the buildings  Coming down  Looking like a controlled demolition  Why wouldn't it  Why wouldn't a building  Coming down like that  Look like a controlled demolition  And what's the problem  With it looking like that  It doesn't mean it is one  And he said that some of the floors  Were closed  You know  Yeah  But his theory  Means that  Every floor  Had to have some kind of  Controlled explosion  Right  I have a question  Someone who knows  But he throws that whole point 
[02:35:00]  Out the window  By saying  Look  It's a known fact  Some of the floors  Were closed for business  Big deal  It's 220 stories  Yeah  You needed 220 floors closed  Can I just say something  I'm so dumb  That I actually believe  A couple times  His sarcasm  When he was like  I don't know anything  I was like  Oh he's admitting it  Oh Jesus  Robert seriously  Bob didn't just say that  I was kidding  He didn't just say that  I have no idea  Bob didn't just say that  It's a comedy show  I was just trying to add  Oh thanks  Someone who knows math  There is a formula  And I just don't know it  Where when I heard 
[02:35:30]  That argument  About the floors falling  There's something  With the way  Things propel  As they're coming down  Term of life  Whatever it is  There's a mathematical  Formula for that  And I heard someone  Shut somebody down  And he's like  You don't understand  This formula  And I don't know  What it is  Is there anybody out  That really knows  That is for real  Because it does exist  Yeah but if you ever  Saw a controlled  Detonation  In Vegas  They actually have to  Go in  Smash certain walls down  Take out support beams  It just  You can't just go in  Stick dynamite in the closet  Is it a cartoon 
[02:36:00]  Yeah and blows up  Yeah exactly  Dude you know what  In the next week  What are they going to do  Everybody's not going to  Go to work  Dude it's a bunch of  Bullshit  Fucking lying  It happens just like that  Don't you ever watch  Control demolition  Dude it takes weeks  All the furniture  Comes out  The furniture  Comes out  Hey voodoo dick  Very good  Why do I fucking love  When he does that  We're all doing it out  Because you know  I pay attention to you  Voodoo dick from  Long Beach writes 
[02:36:30]  Did opie say  I said this  But I was reading  Someone else's  In some feedback  Voodoo dick writes  Did opie say  JFK committed the  Troops before he was  Shot  Compared to what  All his post-mortem  Projects  Alright well that was  Very interesting radio  To say the least  Oh god  It was  Oh my god  Hannity's going to  Eat him up tonight  On Hannity calls  Yeah Hannity  He won't have enough  Time  That's the problem 
[02:37:00]  That's why I think  We got some great  Stuff out of him  Because on a TV show  You got seven minutes  Maybe  If you notice too  Larry King is on the  Front of the book  His little quote about him  When you made your joke  About Larry King  He really was like  He didn't get it  Yeah I know  Because his buddy  It's the quote on the  Front  His buddy is just a  Big Jew head  On shoulders  Let's go to Minnesota  Bert  What's up Bert  What's up man  Hey Bert  How are you  Pretty good  Good  I just want to give  Jimmy props on that  All that douche  Ever did when he was 
[02:37:30]  Governor of Minnesota  Was give $2,000  Back to about  Three quarters of the  Citizens  Otherwise he didn't  Even finish his term  He left early  I believe  Thank you very much  Well he did say  His wife was  Yeah his wife  With health issues  I mean  That would have  Like $2,000  Really  To add it to your  $32 million  I don't have  $32 million  Like $30 now  That's good  Oh you convinced me  Well good  Glad  Rob from  Your little ear 
[02:38:00]  Is fucking killing me  Rob from Rhode Island  You see his big  Fucking ears  Holy shit  How did they  Fucking Nazi  Him swimming  For demolition  Get Jesse  Back in here  He's gonna come  Out of your toilet  And cut your balls  Off while you're  Shitting  I have to sleep  Yeah and I will  If you keep talking  Oh fuck  Oh no  We might have  Your formula  Jim  Rob  Rhode Island  Hey Jimmy  What's going on  I got your formula 
[02:38:30]  For you  A little velocity  Yes  About the building  Falling  I mean  Yeah yeah yeah  It's 9.8 meters  Per second  For every second  That it falls  And then it goes up  To 180 miles  An hour  About  So if you're  At the top floor  The top floor  By the time it  Got down  You gotta figure  How tall  Are the buildings  About a thousand  Feet say  In that area  Yeah  1100 feet  Not including  The spire  At the top  Right of course  So by the time  It got down  To the bottom  It was hit  180 miles 
[02:39:00]  Wait wait wait  How many stories  Was the building  110 stories  Oh okay  No 220 right  No no no  Total  I was combining  Both buildings  For floors being closed  You scared me  Because I did  Some quick math  I'm like wow  There were a lot  Of short people  In the  Twin towers  That would have  Had to be under  Five feet  It was a building  Filled with midgets  Let's say it was  About 1100 feet  The beam John Malkovich  Right  Right  A building  A bunch of  Four foot floors  In that  It also didn't start  Falling from  The top floor  It started falling  From first of all  Ten floors down 
[02:39:30]  And then the weight  Especially the first one  Fucking fell from  A tremendous height  I mean the middle  Of the building  Like the 60th floor  Yeah  Or 70th floor  Yep  Whatever  79th  Yeah  I'm not exactly sure  Like from that  Because you're going to  Have weight coming down  On it  So  But that's  That's the formula  To figure it out  I don't think it would  Really matter  Weight wise  When it comes to  Something like that  Hold on sir  We have a maven  Go  Dude  Listen  You don't do a good  Bob Kelly 
[02:40:00]  I don't  I don't do a good one  He does it way better  But you  If they  If they  If they actually  Would plan this  The government  Just putting these people  On the thing  I don't understand  Are they saying  That the pilots  Were in on it too  Is that what they're saying  Is that what he's saying  I don't know  Is he saying  That like the whole plane  Was in on this  Smashing into the building  Yeah  How does that work  He'll probably say  That nobody on the plane  Was in on it  Maybe he'll say  That the plane  Didn't exist  Who knows  What he'll say  He was disputing  The fact that  The terrorists  Actually took the planes 
[02:40:30]  Over with nothing  But box cutters  And stuff  So was  Was the whole plane  In on it  Was the pilots  In on it  Even if they  Weren't in on it  If they  Weren't in on it  They just said  The government  Put terrorists on planes  They were supposed to  You can't  The odds that  You know  Maybe somebody  Does do something  Yeah  Well that's what  Jimmy was saying  There's so many things  That could have happened  What if the plane  Doesn't hit it  But you have all these  Explosives  Ready to  That was the one  I forgot  I've made that  Argument before  What if  Something happens  And that fucking 
[02:41:00]  Plane doesn't even  Take off  Yeah right  What if there's  A mechanical problem  Yeah some kind  Of problem  And the fucking  Building  You don't think  They would have  Searched in the building  And make sure  That's the point  I forgot  Too many loose ends  That's the one I didn't  Too many fucking  Loose change  Loose change  Let's go to  Mongo the trucker  Mongo  Morning guys  Good evening  Hello  Mongo  I was a fireman  For nine years  And the whole thing  About fire can't  Bring down a steel  Building is bullshit 
[02:41:30]  A normal  A normal house fire  The ceiling can get  Up to a thousand  Degrees in a normal  Residential structure  So if you add  Jet fuel to it  All steel has to do  Is get to about  Eighteen hundred degrees  To lose its tensile  Strength  And then  Especially if it has  Damage to it  From the impact  Bring it down  In a second  They all seem to  Believe that metal  Has to be molten  Melting beams  Before the building  Will fall down  It doesn't have to  Just you know  Kind of take away 
[02:42:00]  A little of the  Integrity of the  Beam by melting  By softening it  And the building's  Coming down  Plus the way that  Building was constructed  It was like a stencil  Like it was a new  Design in buildings  To get that up there  Well Anthony will tell you  Exactly what it's called  What?  The building of the  Twin Towers  What that  Oh a little  Exoskeleton  That's right  It had on it  With a center  Shaft  That was made of steel  And then steel beams  That went from the  Center shaft  To the outside 
[02:42:30]  To the exoskeleton  So that when all that  Cement starts falling  It's almost being  Funneled down  Through the metal  Exoskeleton  Which you saw  Bending out like  The banana peel  And at the end  You saw them  Still sticking straight up  That guided  The building  Straight down  Yeah  That's why it  Didn't tip over  That's why you know  Oh it looked like  A controlled explosion  Yeah  It did look like one  So  Why did they find  The black box  And then Muhammad  Atta's passport  They did find  That's a great question  That is a great question 
[02:43:00]  Like what did happen  To the black box  Why would they find  Something like that  It's paper  That could have  Flown out  But maybe the  Government  Found the box  You know  And they  Took it away  That's something  I could definitely say  You know something  Maybe the government  Did lie on that one  Maybe we found them  And they took it away  Because that's a  Government agency  The FAA  They could have found it  Taken it away  And we'll never  Fucking know  What was on there  Or why  Maybe for national security  Reasons  Who the fuck knows  Why did the  Pentagon pictures 
[02:43:30]  Not get released  Why do they  Hold back on  I also have questions  About the government's  Behavior  But I don't believe  Those questions  Answers  Are  That they were in on it  And they did  Definitely took it  Bush took advantage  Of the situation  For his own cause  Of course  For his own dickdom  Yeah of course he did  Dude  Alright  Exactly  Oh  Jesus Christ  I can't even say  I can't even  I can't even  But the thing is  That's the type of thing  You'd say alone  What  That's exactly what you say 
[02:44:00]  When you're alone  What was it  Dad Bush does that  For his own cause  No that's what you say  In a conversation  It's in the conversation  Now that you would  Use words like  Jimmy  Do you think  I just talk  Alone all the time  Jesus  Because you're not  Exactly sure  Of which terms  Jimmy I'm not gonna  Let you make me  Into a fucking dummy  I do  I do talk  Asshole  God  No  Alright  I just  I think it said  Got something  But God did  That was very good  That was a great joke  I'm sorry  Come on 
[02:44:30]  Alright let's go to  Dave in Jersey  Dave what's up  Hey good morning boys  Hey I wonder if  Jesse Ventura  Has the same  Same thoughts  About landing on the moon  Was that a big  Government conspiracy  As well  That would have been  Nice to ask him  Maybe next time  Yeah  Could have done another  Yeah he's coming back  No we didn't land  On the moon  Exactly  Really  Aha you know  Book signing  Having shitty  Publisher  Motherfucker  Wow  Oh man  I'm only joking  I love it

[03:01:00]  Fidel Castro did  But yeah of course  I just thought  It was ridiculous  That he would believe  Everything he said  Yeah he really did  Talk to Fidel  Like he was  Fucking honest name  Or George  In front of an apple tree  Yeah  Can we please hear that clip  Because it was just so mean  When he just hit the bomb  Just a minute ago  When the caller  Just got mad at Bob  It was so uncalled for  To call Bob

[03:03:30]  No  No it does  Why  I was 800 when I showed up  I'm 910 now  Stop eating  That was a good one  That was a great one  I don't know why  I'm not gonna laugh  Cause it's about me  But you guys missed it  Robert Kelly's latest project  Just a tip  A CD and a DVD  You can get it on  Amazon.com right now  I just love  A drive in the country  Laughing with  Opie and Anthony  That plane is flying  Offly low  Don't you think Ramon  Ramon 
[03:04:00]  Call 9-1-1  This show never gets old  So during the break  Anthony is talking about  How he went to the shooting range  Went to the range  Yes today  And he got a pistol permit  Recently  So I asked the question 
[03:04:30]  Are you walking around  Your house with a gun  And he goes  Of course  I got a holster  So then we got scenarios  We're thinking that  He just walks around  His big empty  I'm all alone house  And next thing you know  Makes believe there's an intruder  And turns around like  Hey  Got you covered man  No I don't do that  Do you have targets  That pop up in your kitchen  In your living room  No  It's not like Hogan's Alley  Hogan's Alley  That's  That's not Hogan's Alley  That's not like a fun life 
[03:05:00]  You know you got your own  Beautiful mansion  That you've had custom built  And you carry a gun around  So you're not attacked  By minorities  That's not like a fun way to be  That's a happy life  You've made it  All right  Wait till they find you  With your throat slit  Liberal  What throat  That'd be tight  Jesse  Jesse Ventura  No it's  Let me tell you something  I was saying  I went to the range yesterday  Love it  I got myself  A SIG  P220  It's a .45 caliber  It's a wonderful weapon  It's loud as a motherfucker 
[03:05:30]  And leaves gaping holes  In the target  I fired it yesterday  At the range  A lot of fun  Great gun  It's also the shorter version  It's the carry version  So I have a holster  And I'm able to wear it  And if it's not uncomfortable  Okay  And I'm around my own house  And there's not children around  There's not anything else  And if I'm around my own  Fucking big house  Why the fuck  Is it odd  That I would carry my pistol 
[03:06:00]  Around like me  Let me just ask you a question  If you're watching TV  And you have your pistol  Around your waist  And your holster  And you come across  Like a Clint Eastwood western  Do you feel silly then  Like he's got a little holster on  I don't have a western holster  Yeah do you go  Hey Clint  Look just like you  See  It's a concealed holster  I have a conversation with the TV  It's a concealed holster  It's something  You don't wear it  Like fucking on your leg  Like a Han Solo's blaster  It's not just above my new cap  If they had that  You'd buy that  Hell yeah  Cool  There's a reason 
[03:06:30]  You shouldn't do  What you're saying you're doing  Why  Because mommy might come by  With an apple pie  I'm not shooting through the door  I'm not doing that  I'm not brandishing  I'm not answering the door  With it on  What do you do  But if I'm hanging out  And I'm sitting on the computer  It might be up on the table  It might be in my holster  Brad Lawrence from Jersey  Why not  What happens  Hey  Hey  What happens if someone  Breaks into my house  I'm armed right there  Boom  I draw a gun  I draw a gun  And I'm fucking defending myself 
[03:07:00]  It's not good enough  Yeah thank you  It's not good enough  What else do you have to do  Anthony  It wasn't good  It wasn't good enough  What's the next step  Those are rifles and shotguns  And normally  I said they were all around the house  But they really kind of  You know  There were some areas  Where they're not  Downstairs  Why don't you just get claymores  Get claymores  I'm not getting claymores  Tripwires  Tripwires  No tripwires  Put a 50 cal  In your front window  If you have a  Why the hell 
[03:07:30]  Wouldn't you have it on you  Because you're safe  In your house  During the day  Are you  Ask somebody  That's been the victim  Of a home invasion  If they're safe  In their fucking house  But you'll still have time  To get your shotguns  And all that  How am I going to have time  You got a state of the art  Security system  You got pretty much  People walking  Someone fargos my back door  Let's say  With a crowbar  And comes waltzing in  And I'm sitting there  In the living room  Going  Oh fuck  My gun is upstairs  My rifle's upstairs  My shotgun's in the closet 
[03:08:00]  Or this that or the other thing  Or  I could just draw my fucking weapon  And fire at them  Here's the answer  Yes  Here's how you get the fucking gun  When they say  When they break in  And you're downstairs  You go  Oh  Let me run up to the closet  And get the gold doubloon  That could work  And then they'll say  Okay  I'll wait here  You'll wait here  Why don't you just learn karate  Karate ain't shit  Compared to a .45 my friend  It's a good cologne though  This whole thing is accelerating 
[03:08:30]  With Anthony  It wasn't good enough to have  I like  It started with one gun  Then I counted at least 10  When I was doing the tour  I lost track  Seriously Bobby  And now he got a pistol permit  And that's not good enough  Now he has to have it on him  At all times  This is where Anthony went  Last week  He's got a guy  Walking the perimeter  This is where he went  You guys were all wondering  Where he took his little plane ride to  And he just disappeared  In midair  He's probably  Blackwater learning  He's going to come in  He's not going to be here one day  Because he's going to be in Iraq 
[03:09:00]  He's going to be in Blackwater  Just shooting people  Just killing Iraqis  Shooting babies  Holding up  Making a baby ear necklace  Hey Gunnut's got it figured out for you  From Virginia  He writes  Anthony just changed the subject  These idiots just don't get it  The pistol is for fighting your way to your rifle  That's right  Wow  What a good  See he knows  He knows  I might have to fight my way up  To get to the heavier weapon ring  Are you really walking around with a gun in a holster 
[03:09:30]  You know something  Just get a whistle  If you have a  If you have a handgun  What's wrong with a rape whistle  And you have the right to carry it  The  The  Second amendment to the constitution  Guarantees you that right  Why on earth  Would you not  Have it on you  Why don't you just set up your house  Like a Roadrunner cartoon  What do you mean  Trap doors  Trap doors  Yeah  And  Paint that I could paint a tunnel  In the wall  You know what you do  Just watch Home Alone 1 and 2 
[03:10:00]  And then just  Paint cans  Oh  Than had it too  Bobby  Oh I'm sorry  It would be known  Than had it  How much fun  You're like a grown up  Macaulay Culkin  Is what than  Oh  Yeah  That's me  Only I'll  I'll just shoot  When you get your pool  Giving jokes away  Don't get mad  When you get your pool  Yeah  It's gonna be so much fun  To see you on the diving board  In the summer  In your little bikini  Underpants  Bathing suit  And your fucking  Strapped on  What if I'm in mid dive  And a criminal  Comes into my yard  To steal my hibachi  I want to shoot 
[03:10:30]  Before I hit  Before I cannonball  Into the water  He's gonna have a spear gun  Inside the pool  Just in case  Something happens  Let me tell you something  He'll always come up silently  Out of the water  Let me tell you something  There is a feeling  Of confidence  Yes  And security  That you get  When you have  A nice firearm  On your hip  There is a feeling  Of security there  That you just know  It's there  It's one less thing 
[03:11:00]  For you to worry about  Can I just say something  In this horrid society  We live in  Yes sir  There's also  There's also the same feeling  In the house  You live in a house  No  It's not like  You live in the ghetto  Ass  Do you think  Holy shit  Cakes  Do you think  What  That people  Don't get  Home invaded  On Long Island  Yeah but  It's ridiculous  Not while your car  Is in the driveway  Yes they do  They absolutely do  With the state of the art  Sound system 
[03:11:30]  And alarm system  Yeah  It happens  All the time  Not really  It happens  All the fucking time  To guys though  Yes they end up  With a phone cord  Around their throat  With their fucking  Wives being raped  I know you're 44  But  You know  Even though you're 44  You still have time  To get one of your  Many guns  If the alarm system  Goes off  No  Not always  I was with you pal  But now with this  Carrying the gun in a holster  It's getting a little weird  You don't  In a holster  In a holster  The holster 
[03:12:00]  Is just what it got  You're getting this image  Of a holster  Where I got a tied down  Fucking western gun  And I'm going around  Flipping it around  Like Doc Holliday  Pew pew  Do you have a hat  I'm your hooker bear  Do you got a hat  Yeah I got a hat  Do you have a star  That you put on your shirt  No I don't put a sheriff  Star on my shirt  Are you the sheriff  Of the  I am the sheriff  Of my house though  I'm the law  And that motherfucker  He puts his right palm  On the butt of the gun  I bet sometimes  You just feel it 
[03:12:30]  You just got your palm  Ripped on  I think I do do that sometimes  I think Anthony  Goes home  He takes off his radio clothes  And puts on his sheriff  My sheriff of the house outfit  I could just see Anthony  With a sparkling star  He's out at 12  He doesn't go to bed  He goes out in the backyard  And just watches over his fence  Like the Mexican border  Just looking up to the moon  And then  Saying who's out there  Who's out there  Where does it end Anthony  With a moat  Where do we end it  No I'm pretty  I'm pretty much done 
[03:13:00]  I think I have everything  Everything I need  I'll probably pick up  A couple more  A couple more pistols  I think  I like them  They're fun  They're nice to shoot  I like going down to the range  Me and Keith  Are getting matching  Desert Eagles  Oh isn't that adorable  Oh my god  It's a .50 caliber  Yeah  It's a real wrist breaker  What does it take  For you to let go  Of your gun  They're very cool  Hot teenage ass  To what  To let go of it 
[03:13:30]  That's how he gets it  Like let's say  Let's say you got  Like a hot girl  In your mansion  Uh huh  And you're walking around  With a gun and a holster  And bikini underwear  Are you willing to give up  Your pistol  To you know  Maybe pleasure  The fine piece of ass  Put it up on the night table  You know  Some girls actually enjoy  Having a gun  Put to the back of their head  While you  While you fuck them  You keep telling yourself that  Oh my god  You keep telling yourself that  In an alley  She liked it  I knew she did  She got wet  Oh my god  He did not say that 
[03:14:00]  Oh my god  See that's the  Desert Eagle  Right there  Look at that  That's a nice looking gun  Isn't it  That's a great gun  Well someone is suggesting  That you shoot him  With your  44th magnum  44th  I don't have a  You remember  The 44th caliber killer  Alright we got  Keith the cop  On the line  We haven't heard  From Keith  In a long time  You hear from him  Every day  Your buddy  Buddy with Keith  Hello Keith  Hey Keith  Oh good morning  Good morning  And as you know  I am spending  A lot of time 
[03:14:30]  At the Cumia residence  Yes he is  He's there supervising  Residence right now  Installation  Oh you're at  My residence  Yes yes  The contractors  Oh contractors  Okay  Keith is pretty much  Walking the camera  From Anthony  And the house  Pretty much  Every drawer  In the house  As  Maybe 50 to 100 rounds  Of ammunition  And a couple thousand dollars  That's great  What the fuck  You probably  You gotta use  Plastic  Forks and spoons  Cause he's got bullets  In the drawer  What are you going  Through my drawers for 
[03:15:00]  I think he's right  I can only imagine  How much money  Keith has lifted  From you  Cause he knows  That you have  No clue  And you know  He was doing  My laundry  The other day  And actually  You know how  You find money  In your pocket  Sometimes  Yeah  Keith how much  Money was in my  Pockets  Yeah you know  I help him out  With the laundry  Stuff  So maybe I'm  Looking  Maybe he leaves  A 10 or a 20  Yeah a 20 would  Be a nice find  Buy myself  Some breakfast  Or something  $2,800  In cash  You know  Wrapped up  In a rubber band  In his pocket  And a few bullets 
[03:15:30]  Why didn't you  Just take it  What are you doing  He's honest  Cause I pay  I tip him money  Take it  Are you a spy  Just take it  He doesn't know  I give him  I give him  A nice chunk of change  For taking care  Of business  At my house  Are you a spy  Am I a spy  At this point  I have to say  He's probably  About 3 or 4 kilos  Of cocaine  And a couple  TV monitors  Away from the end  Of Scarface  And that'll probably  Be the way  This is gonna end up  You know I was  Kind of laughing  At the bullets  That are in  All the drawers  Because they're  Like if I  If I get 
[03:16:00]  Like I went  To the range  Yesterday  And I had  Some  45s  For the  Pistol  But I got  Some new ammo  That I wanted  To load up  In there  So I took  The  I emptied  The magazine  And I had  A handful  Of bullets  So I just  Kind of threw  Them in my  Bottom drawer  But there  There's like  Magazines and ammo  In my socks drawer  And then  Downstairs  By the computer  There's a couple  Of 223  Shells  On my table 
[03:16:30]  There are bullets  Everywhere  That's amazing  Like leave them  Around like  Change  Hey  Oh that's horrible  Boy when  You hear it said  From someone else  It does sound crazy  Yeah it is crazy  At least the guy  Who comes in  With his gun  The guy who comes  Into your house  With his gun  Won't run out of bullets  Yeah  We got one  We got one from Vegas  Opie didn't you have  A colored gentleman  Inches from your  Sleeping head  I bet if things  Went differently  And you were  Biting the pillow  You would have  Wished you had  A chance to  Shoot the bastard  Thank you  Thank you sir 
[03:17:00]  Let me tell you  Something because  Someone has asked  Me that very  Question recently  Why don't you  Have a gun  Anthony has a gun  Anthony has many  Guns why don't  You have one  I don't  I'm not even  I'm gonna be real  For a moment here  I don't trust  Myself with a gun  Really  Absolutely not  I'd be the one  That just shoots  Because I'm stupid  Yeah  Oh really  You'd like  Lob a few shots  Out the window  No I don't know  I think when you  Own a gun  You have to have  A good sense  Of responsibility  And you gotta  Really understand  The power that  Gives you  And understand  The 
[03:17:30]  What's the word  I'm looking for  The coolness  Well the coolness  Sure  I'm kidding  You have to have  A certain temperament  You do  You absolutely do  Understand the  Seriousness of it  Yes  It's not a toy  I don't trust  Myself enough  To have a gun  But he does  I don't  Anthony should  Yeah I understand  We're different  I grew up  I grew up  Drives in a circle  Until he burns a clutch  And videotapes  The whole thing  Spends all night  On pal talk  Yeah  No he's the guy  That should have  Fucking ammunition  In every drawer 
[03:18:00]  He gets a rental  Childhood rage issues  Gets a rental out there  In Colorado  And sees if he can  Break a hundred  Yeah I know  Are you guys gonna  Laugh at anything  Out there today  We're working hard  Over here  Oh my god  God  That is horrible  Jimmy  Jimmy just kinda  Oh man  Boy you've put it  In perspective  The picture of  Responsibility  He can't drive  Five feet  Without yelling  Racist shit  Out of the truck  Window  So do you let  Do you let Keith  Be the sheriff 
[03:18:30]  And you're the deputy  Or  Where are we at  With this  Keith is  When Keith's  Over the house  He is the law  Yeah  He's the law  Uh huh  And uh  No  When I'm alone  In the house  You know  I'm the law  Uh oh  I think somebody  When you're alone  In your house  You're alone  With your thoughts  Uh oh  What  What Jimmy  Problem  I just think  I know  Who likes being  Fucked with a gun  To the back  Of his head  No  I think  Keith the cop  Does a little  Straightening out 
[03:19:00]  And Anthony's behind  Well sometimes  I'm a naughty boy  Jimmy  You're using  Your desert eagle  50 cal  Which one are you  Pointing at me now  It's the 50 cal  You jack off  To that image  Tonight you sick fuck  What even tonight  That's been fucking  Fueling me  Since fucking January  This fucking  Handsome Keith  With his perfect hairdo  And you and all  Your millions  Bent over  You and all your millions  Bent over that lonely bed  Your little fucking  Nice little legs  Splayed out  And the fucking 
[03:19:30]  The lieutenant  Deep dicking you  Jesus  I'm just painting a picture  You certainly are  A little too detailed  You reach for your gun  But he doesn't have one  And it's his partner's balls  And you gotta grab them  And then I usually come  I don't get any farther than that  As soon as you grab  The partner's balls  I fucking spill it all over myself  Fantasy over  I can't get any farther than that  Because they're hanging  And they're not white  Was Keith done?  Where is Keith?  Probably  Okay  Keith I'm sorry  I threw you into that one too  Yeah  Overseeing some projects 
[03:20:00]  At the house  Apologize for throwing Keith  In the  Yeah  That's so funny  Just ammo  And thousands of dollars  2,800 bucks  Ammo and money  And my  That's good  You don't want  A fucking home invasion though  Now everybody knows  You got fucking  Just cash laying all over  Come on in  Motherfucker  There you go  Try it  There you go  Let it out  There you go  Let it out  Anthony  See it ends with  Anthony shooting someone  He really needs  To shoot someone  No no  I've said it before  That would be tragic  Then that'll take care  Of all the daddy issues  I would never want to do that 
[03:20:30]  I could never live with that  That would be awful  Why do you fantasize about it?  I do not  Dude you fantasize  I do not  I've heard on this show  Yes  You fantasizing about someone breaking in  And you have your Claire shot  And you have the gun here  A plan is not a fantasy  You gotta have a plan  You gotta think it through  And you gotta know how your weapon works  And how you draw your weapon  And we're gonna shoot him  And that's what you go to the range for  Let it be known 
[03:21:00]  A lot of people agree with Anthony  Of course they do  I mean let's take a couple of years  I'm a card carrying NRA member my friend  Someone run away  Now I'm trying to rework NRA  Oh no  Oh you did it  Jesus  Hello  Sorry Jimmy  Michael in Texas  Michael  Jesus  Anthony can be wrong about his personal protection  Every day for the rest of his life  And be fine  You guys be wrong one time  And you're fucked  You could die  Literally fucked  Or just beaten 
[03:21:30]  To a pulp  Robbed  And you'd be sitting there going  Looking around  The first thing you'll do  Let me tell you  The first thing you'll do  When someone breaks into your house  Or tries to do something bad to you  Is you start looking around  That's the first thing you'll fucking do  Is go  Where's the rock?  No it isn't  I'll be a caveman  Where's the rock I could hit him with?  The first thing I do  Is throw my wife at him  And then I run out the back door  You know what's gonna be funny?  The guys are gonna break into Anthony's house  And he's gonna grab for his gun  Like fucking Fredo  And he's gonna drop it  And he's gonna fucking rape and rob him 
[03:22:00]  He'll just fumble it  All these years  Of chafing my side  With that fucking gun belt  For naught  For naught  Fumble it  Like he's fucking  Like a good to bad to ugly  He's got the bullets strapped around his chest  That's pretty ass  Did Keith hang up  Because he had to get supper on for him  Yes  He's gotta get supper on for me  Crime rates are down  Crime rates are down  Turn on the TV 
[03:22:30]  You see home invasions  And it's where I live  Let's go to Sean in California  It has to be said yes  That there are a lot of  Long Island is the haven  Of home fucking invasions  Is that true?  Yes  It's pretty bad Bobby  That I'll say  Sean in California  What's up?  Let's do it  Forty-first  Forty-first  Forty-first  I gotta agree with Anthony  Thank you sir  I moved from a crappy neighborhood  Here in San Diego  To a really nice one  Never had any problems  In the old neighborhood  And two weeks in 
[03:23:00]  Had two tweakers  Try to break in my front door  And I've been in law enforcement  For ten years  And I felt like  Such a fucking idiot  When I'm trying to get  The safe open  In the middle of the night  To go confront these people  See do you have kids  Do you have kids?  No  I live by myself  Oh see  That's the best  Why is the gun in a safe?  Wow  I thought it'd be  The safest thing  But now I've got  Guns and magazines  I completely agree  Oh I got magazines  All over the place  I completely agree  If you have a gun  It shouldn't be in a safe  No  They have cool safes though 
[03:23:30]  That go kind of  Under your table  It's  All you do is  Put your hand in  And it reads your fingerprints  And the door opens up  And the gun drops  And the gun's right in your hand  So it's locked up  In that safe  And it can only read your hand  And you put your hand on there  Boom  Drops right in  I'm sure you're getting one of those  Why?  I keep mine right out  Well you might have to  Put other things in there  Mine's right out  On my night table  Every night  I go to sleep  Why don't you put it in a drawer  It's right there  What?  Why?  Open the drawer  More time  What if you have an itch? 
[03:24:00]  What if you have an itch  And you go to scratch it  And it's the gun by mistake  Well I gotta pick up the gun  And itch my head  I hope not  I hope one night you get  Why would I do that?  I hope you get really drunk  And just pass out  And you wake up like good fellas  With some black dude  With your gun  Right in your face  No one's doing that  Just straddling your torso  Why does it have to  Why does race have to come into this?  And do you understand  He doesn't even sleep at this point  He's so paranoid  This guy doesn't sleep  With one eye open all the time  Yeah  Anthony's idea of sleeping  Is like closing one eye  And then going  Z  Z  Meanwhile  It would all get picked up 
[03:24:30]  On the scanners  I want the scanners  He actually sleeps outside  In like a teepee  No I don't  Just watching your house  I'm in the safety and sanctity  Of my home  Hey uh  Give the fucking keys  To the front door  Do you walk around  You walk around nude  With your gun  Just for the hell of it  No  Never nude with the gun  You've never put it on nude though  Never put it on nude  With just underwear  Why would I do that?  Because you're a weirdo  I am not a weirdo  I make sure I'm fully clothed  What did you say?  He has body shame issues  He has body shame  He's embarrassed by his giant cock  His fucking  The meat 
[03:25:00]  That most of us  Would call a penis  That he has  For his whole life  Been embarrassed about  It would be weird too  If your cock was bigger  Than your leg  He's ashamed  When he's naked  It looks out of proportion  The baby should have  Probably pointed at it  And go  Oh my god Joe  Look at your younger brother  It's so big and weird  Big and weird  Yeah because it probably  Hooks to one direction  And the head is  Misshapened slightly  Because one time  Fucking someone  Like once I'm on the ranch  Stepped on him  When he was a kid  Because it got in the way 
[03:25:30]  Right  One time  It got in the way of a feeding  Actually pulled him out  Of the fucking womb  By his cock  He was shooing a horse  And the horse stepped on him  When I was a kid  The babysitter was over  And I was sitting  Indian style  In my jammies  And my  My wee wee  My little wee wee  Came poking through  The front  And I was just sitting there  And didn't know  And I think the babysitter saw 
[03:26:00]  And I looked down  And noticed it  And I quickly  Pulled it back in  And I looked right at her  I go  Did you see anything?  What a nerd  And she was like  No  No I didn't  But I think she did  Of course she did  And I still remember  How embarrassing that was  And here's what really happens  He blocked it out  He changed the memory  Oh  She fucking pinched it  Really hard  And then people  Invaded his home  And that's when he  All of her friends  Came in  And he  Helpless Anthony  Was having his  Peter pinched  By a mean lady 
[03:26:30]  With ciggy breasts  While older people  Came in  So he  He's so worried  About the weenie pinch  Oh my god  Fucking ciggy breasts  Benson and Hedges breasts  Benson and Hedges  Virginia Slims  And they made him  Come six times  In an hour  It says  Come everywhere  His little weenie  Shot scary stuff  Into her babysitter hand  You know she was  Pinching it to hush him  Hush hush  And she would pinch  The head with her  Fucking ring finger  You hush now  I just don't get 
[03:27:00]  Why people are so  A lot of people  Sleep with their guns  Why don't people think  No everyone's agreeing with you  We just don't agree with you  To have a gun there  It gives you security  Pinching my  Pinching my weenie  I can't get it out of my head  He made it such a beautiful visual  He certainly did  Ziggy breasts  Ziggy breasts  Tom in Indiana  Has got something great for him  Because every weekend  You're looking for a new adventure  Right Ant  Well Tom might have it for you  Tom what's up  What's up Ant  Hey there's 
[03:27:30]  You gotta go to  Machinegunshoot.com  Knob Creek Kentucky  This weekend  They're having  The nation's largest  Machine gun shoot  Well  See I  We don't like  It doesn't  Yeah  I don't  Nah  That doesn't do anything for me  I'm not really  I need like  Fucking huge weaponry  And machine guns  I like  I like a nice semi-auto  I like my  AR-15  I like guns like that  Take them down to the range  Blast a few rounds off  A lot of fun  But isn't it the whole 
[03:28:00]  You could get  You could rent like a  Dillon M134  I don't need to  Why would I want that  I don't need to like  Fire off machine guns  Isn't the whole thing  About having a gun  In your house  To protect yourself  Is having it somewhere  Where you know where it is  Having an alarm system  So when the alarm goes off  You know where the gun is  You go get it  And then you're safe  I don't know  The whole thing  You have to carry it around  Your living room  Because what if  Someone breaks in  And the alarm goes off  And now they're staring  Staring at me 
[03:28:30]  You don't think  They're going to take  A couple of seconds  While the alarm's going off  To do something horrible  And then what  So the alarm company  Can call you  And say  Is something wrong  Oh I'll dispatch the police  And then  Ten minutes later  They can show up  I mean I like having  An alarm and all  But let's be real here  It's not like  A cop pops out  Of a fucking closet  When the thing goes off  You've got to be able  To take care of yourself  In the interim  Just a fat  Mutual Italian  Jumps out of the closet  With 19 guns  Exactly  That'll fucking 
[03:29:00]  Get rid of the problem  Just hire  That's what I say  Just hire a cop  To just like do  You know  I do  He does my laundry  It takes  Thousands of dollars  From my pocket  Anthony why don't you  Just hire a security guy  Like put a security guy  In the front  In a little booth  Like they have  In a booth  In my neighborhood  Oh could you see that  Why not  The neighbors would  Lose their minds  Yeah but they would  All feel safer too  They'd be like  Fucking A  This is cool  Just hire Kevin Costner  To sleep in the pool house  I like 
[03:29:30]  Having a gun  Alright let's go  Joe  I like my guns  Joe  We're trying to wrap up  This topic  But Joe  What do you got  Hey Joe  Joe  How do you do Joe  Hey Opie  Here's something  To make you sleep  Better at night  He's doing all this  Carrying of a gun  While finishing  His 120 dollar  Bottle of Shiraz  Oh yeah sometimes  I like having  A little glass of wine  Sometimes  Overnight  Jimmy did he just  Use the word  Sometimes  And wine  In the same sentence  I don't know 
[03:30:00]  The fact that he said  Glass as opposed  To fucking vase  My wine  Sometimes  My wine guy  Has shown me  Some very nice  Wines  Of course he is  I've been  Getting some of those  And it's wonderful  How did he  Tell you that you  Should take a sip  Of the wine  Did he have any  Way of suggesting it  He put some  On his mule  No I thought  Maybe there was audio  Try this  Yes he did  Of course  Yeah well  Bastard  Son of a bitch  Fuck 
[03:30:30]  A lot of people  Saying you are  I am legend  Yes  I have the same car  And it's better  To have it  And not need it  Yeah  Alright  I mean and  In the situation  I'm in  I'm in my house  I have no kids  There's no pesky kids  That are gonna go around  Toying with the thing  How many times  Have you stumbled  Around your apartment  Because you've had  A little too much wine  And the gun  Has just gone off  And then hit something  I would need a little  Spackle on the wall  It doesn't really  Affect much  Never go to 
[03:31:00]  I would never go  To his place  Like alone  And like  Hey come over  We'll have some drinks  Then he gets drunk  That's ever gonna happen  And he starts getting angry  And then it's like  Alright relax  I know we're only friends here  That's gonna put the gun  To my head  That's true  And the bottom line  But Anthony's a responsible guy  He's the guy  Who should  Honestly  You know  Because most responsible people  Will machine gun a computer  In their own basement  It wasn't a machine gun  It was a semi-automatic  And it was all done  With special effects  Oh no I'm sure  Of course it was  I did it with  Adobe After Effects 
[03:31:30]  Yeah  It made it look like  I shot it  And then I used some  Sound  And muzzle flash  Overlay  And it looked like  I shot it  It was amazing  Very nice  Yeah it looked real  We're gonna do  A little something different  Here now  Entertain the audience  We got a great story  That hit today  Listen to this  T-shirts for fashion  Or opinion  To make a statement  But is this one too much  It says  I was raped  The Seattle woman 
[03:32:00]  Selling these shirts online  Is a rape survivor  She didn't want us  To show her face  But says  She will wear the shirt  And to even have had  That language  To know  What to call it  Or to know  That it had happened  To somebody else  Would have made  A tremendous difference  For me  In terms of not feeling  Like it was something  I should be ashamed of  You have to think about  You have to think about  The consequences  And what would be  I mean  It's not likely to happen  That you're gonna have  Everyone who's been raped 
[03:32:30]  Wearing a t-shirt  Saying I've been raped  This lady's insane  Just trying to  Get controversial  First of all  I want that shirt  And second of all  I'm not a rapist  But if I was  I would seek those shirts out  No kidding  It's like getting  Stripped by lightning  Twice  Huh honey  What it's doing  Is pointing out  The easy targets  Fucking unbelievable  Not only did I get raped  I obviously didn't mind  Getting raped  It's and it's funny  When the back says  Cocktease  Oh shit  It would be even funny  If it said braggart  No it wouldn't 
[03:33:00]  Lucy Berliner  Director of the  Harborview Center  For Sexual Assault  Hesitates to say  Victims should wear  Their pain  On their sleeve  What is this person  Looking for  Are they trying  To get a reaction  Are they trying  To get  See what I think  Why use such  A strong message  Like this  Because you know  We think that  There are a lot  Of women who need it  I mean it's  Certainly not  For everybody  Everybody's kind  Of healing process  Is a little bit different  You don't think  It could backfire  Oh Jesus  Oh I think  Absolutely 
[03:33:30]  That you can wear  Some  What is she  Talking to Roseanne  That's fucking  Unbelievable  It sounds so phony  And I want to know  Where I'm starting a line  I'm a rapist  I'm going to start  Those fucking t-shirts  Absolutely  That you can wear  Something like this  And probably be met  With scorn  Or embarrassment  That's what  Berliner fears  Parents shot down  Bon Macy's  Boys are stupid shirts  The Mariners  Banned Yankees  Sucks shirts  But experts say  The damage when  These shirts  Don't get the right  Reaction  Could be lifelong  And devastating 
[03:34:00]  Yeah  I would love to see  Someone in that shirt  So how was it  And what  You know  My eyes are up here  Yeah but your rape sign  Is right there  On your tits  Might I say  It's lovely  Well PC for Virginia  Rights  I was raped on the front  And on the back  It says  Buy a  Okay cool  Yeah  Personal  I have to make a tinkle 
[03:34:30]  I have couples therapy today  You do  You going with your girl  What is that like  I won't know  I've never gone  I've done it  Wait what happened  I've done it  You want me to tell you  What's going to happen  He's got couples therapy  You want me to tell you  What's going to happen  I don't know if it will  Happen with Chelsea though  Chelsea's a different  What's going to happen  What  I don't know either  No I want to hear from Bobby  Is it the first time you're going  Yes  Yeah  Have fucking  Have fucking fun  Yeah it's good  Works like a charm  It actually does work  It's good  You did couples therapy too  I did it  I went to  I guess it could be considered that 
[03:35:00]  Sure  Okay  Sure  To try to see like  What the fuck was going on  A little bit  You know  Like what the hell is  Where is this change of relationship thing  Coming from  Kind of  Okay  That's good  Oh Jesus Christ  Don't fucking bother  Don't bother  They side with her  Well  No it's kind of  Sometimes they side with you  Sometimes they side with her  Sometimes you get 
[03:35:30]  Blindsided by some shit  But for the most part  It's just  You give the woman  Or the guy  Whoever the therapist is  It was a woman in this case  I think ours is too  You give them money  And it's in their best interest  To keep you coming back  So they don't want to fix you  It's not like  Because it's not like  You know  Cancer  Where it's like  Well we better fix this guy  Once he dies  We ain't getting money anyway  It's something that can go on  And on and on  If my girlfriend had a sense of humor  She'd go with fucking eye makeup on  Like a fucking black eye  Oh see  That would be funny 
[03:36:00]  And every time  Every time she would go to talk  I'd go  And then we  And then the look  Would just shut her down  Just shut up  Shut up  You're always paranoid  You know  Say something  Or some body language  Is gonna look  Make you look stupid  Keep your hand on her knee  And when she starts talking  Just squeeze  Squeeze a little bit  And she goes  No I was wrong  I was wrong  I like  They start crying  I like patting my hip  I like patting the holster  On my hip  That really gets the therapist  I would suggest  Maybe you guys bring the  I was raped bit 
[03:36:30]  To the message boards  And have fun  Because  Oh really  You obviously have  Great imaginations  On instant feedback  Can't read half of them  Oh my god  So you're gonna go  To the couples therapy  Jimmy  And what is  What is this  Whose suggestion was it  I'll give you two guesses  And Jim is not  Correct  That she did  So you're gonna go 
[03:37:00]  And  This is supposed to address  Problems  With you  As individuals  Or as a couple  I would guess  As a couple  Yes  And  What  What did she say  Needs work  I don't know  I think the fact  That we  Like a lot of times  We genuinely like each other  And we just miss each other  Like  It is kind of frustrating  Sometimes  I'm like  I know I'm not that crazy  I know she's not that crazy  Like what is it  But I've never been  A particularly good partner  So I know that about myself  I have a history  That no  I'm not a great boyfriend 
[03:37:30]  You know what I mean  Tell me about it  And you're selfish in bed  So  Good luck  I hope it works for you  Usually what happens  Is as soon as they get in there  They just start crying  They just start  Because women keep stuff back  They hold it in  And then when there's an opportunity  To actually tell  A neutral party  They won't tell you  They haven't said anything  You didn't even know  Any of this existed  And all of a sudden 
[03:38:00]  Some stranger's there  And all of this stuff comes out  Like sometimes  And it's like  Run it through me first  And then the therapist  Does nothing but tell you  That you have to communicate more  You're not communicating enough  You're not telling each other  What each other needs  And then the argument is  Well he shouldn't have to  Listen to what I need  He should know what I need  That's kind of the  But don't you tell you're in the  Communication business  What? 
[03:38:30]  We communicate  I got a good Auschwitz t-shirt  For Jews  I was willing to give it a shot  It says  I went to Auschwitz  And all I got was  This lousy tattoo  But it would be  It would be long sleeve  And you have a tattoo  On this  Nothing  Wow  Sometimes you miss  That come out of the blue  Sometimes you miss on the show  I do have a funny one though  My parents got me this  Because they went to Florida  And they moved me back  A t-shirt  So the shirt goes 
[03:39:00]  My parents went to Florida  And all I got was  This lousy t-shirt  God that is funny  It's almost like  You're putting the complaint  On the gift  Yeah  It's weird  That'd be great  To combine that  With the rape shirt  I went to Florida  And all I got was  Well you know  But how about  She wears  I was rape shirt  You walk by her  With the  I'm with stupid shirt  The rape shirt

[03:54:30]  We leave you with this  We'll see you guys tomorrow  Oh there are several ways  To irritate a lady  You could mention  That her act's gone out of style  Oh that's sure to get a nift  It's bound to cause a tick  But here's a little trick  To go the extra mile  Give her just  A little kick in the cunt  A kick in the cunt?  A kick in the cunt 
[03:55:00]  That's about a nice kick  In the cunt  You'll sure have a stunt  If you go for the punt  With a jolly good kick  In the cunt  Now a lady of grace  Will show utter distaste  For a slur  Or a randy suggestion  But if you call her a whore  It may do nothing more  Than make a subtle change  In her complexion  So give her a kick  In the cunt  A kick in the cunt 
[03:55:30]  Ah a kick in the cunt  As about a lovely kick  In the cunt  Hey  If you aim to annoy  There's no better ploy  Than a rousing good kick  In the cunt  Now you might want a sucker  A clop in the choppers  A shocker by making a rabbit  And knockers  But chill for the coppers  Then you'll end in jail  Where you eat bread and water  And shit in the pail  So if you've enough  Of a womanly guff  No need to be rough  It'll be quite enough  To call a block  With a huff and a puff  To snuff your foot  Straight into the muff 
[03:56:00]  Just an old fashioned  Kick in the cunt  A kick in the cunt  A kick in the cunt  As about a nice kick  In the cunt  You'll sure have a stump  When you go for the cunt  With a jolly good kick  In the cunt  Hoby and Anthony  Are the latest shock jobs  To hit it big  Goddamn  They are heavily into  One thing 
[03:56:30]  Boobies  Boobies  Yes  One of you  I don't know which one  Said then you can  Pull out your business  It's junk  We're artists  You presented as innocent  But I'm not so sure it is  Screw you  We're artists  Is there anything you won't do  For ratings  We are publicity  Whorebags  Publicity sluts  We're artists  This is all about money  That's what it comes down to  Because you're mercenaries  That's clever  Aren't you mercenaries  We're radio mercenaries  Dickhead  We're artists  We're entertainers  We're not psychologists  We're not doctors  We're not daycare workers  We're artists  Though it's all on appearance 
[03:57:00]  None on you  None on us  We're artists  None on us  I'm scared </pre>
