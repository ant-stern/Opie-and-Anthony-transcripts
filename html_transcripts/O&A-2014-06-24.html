<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the misuse of the word "rape," triggered by T-Mobile CEO John Legere's controversial analogy and the offensive comments made at the Daytime Emmy Awards red carpet, particularly by Brittany Furlan.  Clips of both Legere's remarks and the red carpet interviews were played.  This led to a debate on the appropriateness of using "rape" figuratively, and the hosts then transitioned into an analysis of Gary Oldman's controversial Playboy interview, criticizing political correctness and Hollywood figures like Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin. The Daily News's coverage of Oldman's interview was also critiqued.  The conversation took a vulgar turn with a humorous, yet graphic, discussion about the origins of oral sex.  The segment included a call from Joel McHale, who discussed his new Jaguar F-Type R, his reluctance to drive it in New York City, and his experiences at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.  McHale detailed his interactions with Michelle Obama, his jokes about President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Cliven Bundy, and the subsequent food poisoning that afflicted his family after the event. He also mentioned his movie promotion for "Deliverance from Evil."  The segment briefly touched upon Jimmy "the Greek" Snyder's infamous comments and firing, with an audio clip played.  Bob Kelly called in to recount an awkward encounter with Jerry Seinfeld. The hosts also discussed a hoax involving a girl injured by pit bulls and a fraudulent online fundraising campaign.

The show continued with a discussion about a disturbing picture of a cat nailed to a cross.  A caller, Jake, shared a story about a pit bull attack, leading to a conversation about pit bulls and their propensity for biting.  Another caller, Peter, brought up a Tommy Smythe ESPN video clip using the word "jizz." This segued into a discussion about the US-Portugal World Cup match and offensive comments about Germans.  Opie discussed his upcoming party, his strained relationship with DJ Denny, and his guest list, which included Melissa McCarthy and Joel McHale (who had already called in earlier).  A vulgar back-and-forth ensued with a caller, "Lady Di," regarding her past disruptive behavior at Opie's parties.  Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone (Denny's brother) then arrived in the studio.  The conversation shifted to their new movie, "Tammy," their experiences with improv and stand-up comedy, and the movie's release date.

A brief, rushed interview with Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone took place at the start of a segment focusing on love, relationships, and marriage.  Opie, Anthony, and Sam Roberts engaged in a vulgar discussion about their cynical views on love, citing divorce statistics and sharing sexually explicit jokes.  Callers shared their own experiences with failed marriages and relationships, reinforcing the hosts' cynical perspectives. One caller described humiliating experiences involving makeup sex and unusual sexual requests, and another recounted his infidelity.  The segment concluded with a humorous news story about a man who crashed his boat during a three-way.

The show concluded with a discussion about a news story involving a man, Gallo, crashing his boat into LaGuardia Airport's runway approach lights after drinking.  The hosts humorously analyzed the news report and speculated about the events leading up to the crash, including Gallo's prior arrest for public urination.  A phone call with a therapist, Steve, followed, attempting to analyze Anthony's relationship patterns.  The segment ended with an Xbox One giveaway and further off-color jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, good morning everybody. Off and running.  Hi.  Alright, buddy.  I guess rape is a hot topic.  Wow, that's a strange thing to jump right into.  Rape is a hot topic.  Yeah.  Can't say that word.  You really...  Add it to the list.  It's become the R word, but not the R word for mentally challenged. 
[00:00:30]  We're getting some double letter words here.  I don't know what we're supposed to do with that now.  People must be pissed.  Is it the R-A word now?  It's the rape word.  Instead of the R-E word?  You can't say stuff like, oh man, I got raped.  What if you're R-A and R-E?  Huh?  No?  I don't know.  The R word that rhymes with nape.  Yes.  Let's start doing it like that.  Yeah, I don't know.  Rape has, it's always been used as kind of a, not just literal. 
[00:01:00]  There's a figurative thing like, oh, they raped the land, let's say.  Well, that's what I'm getting at here.  Yeah, yeah.  You're not allowed to say that anymore.  What?  The T-Mobile CEO.  There's two rape stories.  I know there's so much to do, but there's two rape stories.  Yeah?  You got the T-Mobile CEO, John Legere.  Is that how you say his name?  Legere.  He apologizes.  There's the apology thing again, which we're kind of starting to, we're trying to downplay that. 
[00:01:30]  But we're not going to go 10 days without an apology.  After comparing competitors to rapists.  You can't say that.  T-Mobile CEO, John Legere, received backlash on the internet after he likened his company's competitors to rapists during a press event Wednesday.  No, he didn't.  Thank you.  It's not likening them to rapists.  Thank you.  It's, absolutely.  He used it differently.  Right.  That was inappropriate when he said that the competitors sneak into your house with a pipe and sodomize your family. 
[00:02:00]  Why did he say that?  That's not what my competitors do.  He never said rape, then.  No, but he said AT&T will hold your wife down and make you watch while they fuck her deep.  I thought that was just wrong.  I think John Legere should sue for that line.  Sue?  Comparing his competitors to rapists.  Legere is known for his profanity and brash personality, but critics say he crossed the line  when he slammed AT&T and Verizon during the press conference, revealing that the company  will let people test drive its data network for free on the iPhone 5S. 
[00:02:30]  Legere took the opportunity to controversially say that other companies don't have customers' best interests in mind.  Ah.  Here's the line that got him in trouble.  All right.  Here it comes.  Hold on.  These high and mighty duopolis that are raping you for every penny you have.  I want to apologize to anyone that was offended by that.  Hearing that statement.  We should have put out a warning before you read that.  How many rapists take your pennies?  Yes.  And then they blank hate you, so I'm assuming the word is fucking hate you. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  They fucking hate you, said Legere.  Social media users let T-Mobile know that they didn't appreciate Legere's rape comparison.  It's not a rape comparison.  The word rape doesn't necessarily mean a sexual assault.  Look it up.  We all know that.  Yes.  We all know that.  He didn't compare his competitors to rapists themselves.  Mm-mm.  God! 
[00:03:30]  T-Mobile spokeswoman Talena Thorburn declined to comment on the statement, but Legere took  to Twitter to apologize for his comments Thursday.  I know I have an R-rated vocabulary, but even I could go too far.  Sincere apologies to anyone offended last night.  But he had to apologize.  He didn't mean that apology, by the way.  We've all heard the word rape used in that way.  Yeah.  And it's fine.  It's fine. 
[00:04:00]  It's fine.  It's okay to say that.  No, apparently not.  Gosh.  I think he's meant to have already compared them to pedophiles.  When he said that, you know, those other competitors will get your phone into the car and molest it.  They'll offer you lower prices, and then when you come in, they're going to molest your mouth and backside.  Oh, that was too much.  God.  Amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  And then you had the daytime Emmys.  Red carpet hosts deemed appalling for rape joke.  Oh, boy. 
[00:04:30]  I guess there was some hunky hunk.  Some hunky hunk soap opera star on red carpet.  I think.  Yeah?  Because I don't watch this shit.  Oh, boy.  That means you watch it every time it's on!  Fake and gay!  The daytime Emmys red carpet correspondence caused quite a stir among viewers Sunday night  with their ignorant and downright offensive comments. 
[00:05:00]  Brittany, Lauren, Jessica, and Megan, I don't feel like saying their last names.  I don't even know who these people are.  Were selected by the National Academy of Television, Arts, and Sciences for being millennials between the ages of 18 and 35.  All ethnicities who have a strong entertainment news background and or very strong media following.  As the soap opera network previously reported.  What does that mean?  They just picked these people because they're good with Twitter?  Is that what happened?  Yeah.  Like one's a Vine celebrity.  One's a YouTube celebrity. 
[00:05:30]  Ooh.  And what else?  I don't know what, uh, they're all internet celebrities.  Oh.  And they're millennials.  Nice.  So they were picked to do the red carpet?  Yeah.  While the ladies may have a strong social media presence, their remarks concerning race and rape  showed just how oblivious they were to not only entertainment news, but basic social etiquette.  And how they fit in on this program.  That's right.  Exactly.  I would almost watch the daytime Emmys if I knew this shit was going on.  Who cares about the daytime Emmys?  Instead of the bland, who gives a fuck questions, what are you wearing, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:06:00]  Uh, let's see.  Furlan literally came onto and hard.  What?  This doesn't even read properly.  Furlan in parentheses literally came onto and hard.  Every male, okay, in attendance to a degree that makes, whatever, okay.  He added that Harlow called the bold and the beautiful star Lawrence St. Victor, a beautiful  chocolate man, before asking him, what it's like to be a black man on a soap opera these 
[00:06:30]  days?  I don't know if that's appropriate, guys.  Oh, that's so terrible.  I don't know.  What's wrong with that?  What's actually wrong with that?  What's wrong with that?  Like, honestly.  There's BET.  They celebrate blackness.  Yes.  So you can't say that?  You can't even say that.  Did you see the clip, though?  She actually, what happens when he walked up, she went, so what's it like to be a black  man?  And they felt that her spitting.  She checked his teeth first. 
[00:07:00]  She shouldn't have spit her gum on the floor like that.  Maybe that was rude.  Yeah, it's too much.  And here's what got him in trouble.  Oh, boy.  Furlan.  I don't know who Furlan is.  Brittany Furlan.  Uh, finally stuck her foot in her mouth again when she told general hospital actor Ryan  Pavey, I guess.  I don't know.  Pavey, whatever.  We're going to get you away from us before we rape you.  There you go.  Look out.  Girls are allowed to say that.  They've been saying that forever.  She's talking about cell phone prices anyway. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  See?  I think that's okay as well.  Of course it is.  The first one, definitely okay.  This one, I think, is okay as...  Oh, you got the actual clip?  Ooh.  Fuck.  I stumbled through that reading and we had a fucking video.  What's wrong with you, Sam?  We're going to talk to you backstage later, too.  What are you most excited for tonight besides us backstage later?  Backstage conversation?  I'm excited to root for my teammates.  I'm Team GH tonight. 
[00:08:00]  So while I'm not nominated, I'm going to be here.  I'm going to be that boisterous, loud guy where they're just like...  No, they're going to be like, cut to that really good-looking guy again.  One more time.  One more time.  That's why they keep inviting you back, even if you're not nominated.  They need you here.  Listen to these whores.  I want to go to your general hospital.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I actually, I play a detective.  Oh.  Whoops.  Mysterious.  That's something you need to investigate.  A vagina?  I don't have like a stethoscope or anything, but I do have handcuffs.  Okay.  Well, where is this interview going?  This is getting really interesting.  This is why I stay in the middle. 
[00:08:30]  If she wasn't here, you don't know what would happen.  No, actually, we shot a scene the other day where I had two sets of handcuffs, so...  Oh, my God.  I don't even want to know.  We're going to get you away from us before we rape you.  Okay, so nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  Have fun tonight.  I was offended by the rest of the interview, actually.  They're terrible.  Yeah, but they're just fucking goofballs from the internet.  I didn't mind that.  Who cares?  Why is that a story today?  They were making these sexual innuendos.  Of course.  They were going back and forth. 
[00:09:00]  I wasn't sure.  I think it was sexual innuendos.  I think they wanted their pussies examined.  Yes, they wanted him to investigate.  I think you...  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yes.  I was going to really just...  They want to be cuffed.  Yes.  Handcuffed.  Handcuffed.  Why is that a story today?  I don't know.  Because they said the word rape.  So what?  You got...  Oh, rape.  Rape.  It's a dirty word now.  It's one of those words.  You can't fucking use it.  Women are saying the word? 
[00:09:30]  Mm.  Yeah.  That should be okay.  Rape is the word.  Is the word.  Have you heard?  I've never...  Oh, never mind.  Uh-oh.  That's a woman.  Did you come close?  That's a woman's word.  Is it?  Yes.  Have you ever been offended by hearing someone say,  Hey, I'm going to rape you?  Oof.  One time in lockup.  Or Scott said it was contract time.  Well, exactly.  That's what I mean by, you know.  We've been raped over and over again by SiriusXM.  I think it's okay to say it in that way. 
[00:10:00]  Exactly.  I should.  God.  It's nonsense.  Absolute nonsense.  Mm-hmm.  Just two silly broads, you know, doing the red carpet.  Who cares?  Very silly.  What are they famous for on the internet?  Just kind of...  Vine.  Do they have little shows?  Instagram.  Vines.  Things like that.  Oh, they're not soap girls?  No.  No, they're not soap girls.  Like Jenna Marbles?  Yes.  Are they like Jenna Marbles?  She's still doing videos?  Yeah.  Like Jenna.  She's funny.  Still?  No, she's not really funny, but she's hot. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  I saw her in Ridiculousness.  I guess they were running out of guests on Ridiculousness.  What is that?  They never had guests on Ridiculousness.  Well, they do have guests.  They have like...  No, I mean they never had guests.  Yeah?  They're just people.  They're just people.  They're just kind of his friends.  They're like low-rate rap guys.  Right.  Like Jackass guys.  I think they've had everyone from Jackass on.  They don't really get...  And it's the same videos you see on Tosh, but they're not presented funny.  They're just kind of presented. 
[00:11:00]  What?  In a ridiculous way.  In a ridiculous, hence the name of the show, I gather.  Unbelievable.  So rape is now off the table.  Ah, yeah.  You can't use it anymore unless it's actual rape, and you must use it with reverence and  respect and all due.  Yeah.  Well, that's just the warm-up to the Gary Oldman thing.  Oh.  Good old Gary Oldman is speaking his mind. 
[00:11:30]  We had Gary Oldman on the show.  He was awesome.  And he was fucking great.  We loved him.  What a surprise that was.  I expected an English actor to come in and maybe be a little stuffy.  And because he's such a good actor.  Right.  He came in here and was hilarious.  He was a lot of fun.  Very open.  So what's the problem with Gary Oldman?  I don't know.  Apparently, he's the Daily News saying he should have stuck to a script.  Yeah.  The Hollywood liberal bullshit PC script. 
[00:12:00]  Does the Daily News understand what they print on a regular basis, and they're outraged  by what Gary Oldman has to say?  The biggest hypocrites.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  It says, fuck Ape Man.  Ooh.  Right?  Yeah.  When you put all those fucking things together.  Is that supposed to be like Oldman, but Ape Man?  Yes.  I don't get it.  Because he's in Planet of the Apes?  Isn't he in Planet of the Apes?  Yes.  Oh, that's a clever tie-in.  Well written. 
[00:12:30]  Oh.  So what's going on?  Well done.  What is he saying?  Oh, boy.  Well, he's sick and tired of all this PC bullshit.  Right.  He's sick and tired of the fact that some people, based on their political ideology,  can get away with saying certain things.  Right.  While other people of other political ideologies cannot.  Right.  Are ye...  Look at Jon Stewart.  People like Jon Stewart.  And he can get up on his little soapbox and make jokes about gays, lesbians, racial jokes, 
[00:13:00]  and everyone laughs and laughs and laughs.  Right.  But the same joke, spouted out by the likes of Mel Gibson or Gary Oldman or anyone else  that maybe isn't as liberal, gets chastised.  I think it's in the presentation, though.  Thank you.  I think it's in the presentation.  What do you mean?  Mel Gibson was fucking turning blue.  He was screaming so loud.  Well, he wanted the blowjob first and then the jacuzzi. 
[00:13:30]  I think when Jon Stewart makes his jokes and goes edgy, he doesn't turn blue when he's  doing it.  Well, Mel Gibson is an anomaly in that situation.  But if you just take somebody that's known for more conservative or Republican views, they  get pounded just from...  Well, even Alec Baldwin, who isn't conservative, he's become the scourge for saying fag.  Out on the street, calling the paparazzi guy a fag. 
[00:14:00]  But another guy that has his presentation, he turns a nice red color when he's...  A little volatile, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A few veins popping.  Right.  But I think Gary Oldman makes some fine points here.  He does.  Let's see.  The dawn of the planet of the ape star exposed himself as another Hollywood blowhard.  Blowhard?  When he offered a profanity-laced defense of scandal-scarred actors Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin.  It's just amazing. 
[00:14:30]  They automatically condemn him.  Just because what he's saying makes sense, though.  Bill Maher, he's another one.  On his show, he could say whatever the fuck he wants about any group.  And he's impervious to criticism, for the most part.  I mean, the only time he was criticized when he said shit about the soldiers or how brave,  how not cowardly the hijackers were. 
[00:15:00]  And then it's the right that came after him.  But the left, they won't touch him.  Making lesbian, gay, black jokes, whatever.  By the way, Dana White was on Ridiculousness.  And Dana White's a pal of ours.  I saw Dana on Ridiculousness.  My point is, when you do, you know, tune in to Ridiculousness, you don't really see a lot of big-name stars.  No, you see, like, the guy going, wow, that looked like it hurt.  Like, who was that guy?  Oh, man, he got up high and then fell. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  But in general, it's who give a fucks.  Who cares?  In an interview with Playboy magazine, the 56-year-old actor railed against political correctness  and so-called hypocrisy, producing his own bigoted ranch.  He's 56?  He's got to be older, right?  He's been around forever.  I would absolutely assume he's older than that.  Come on.  How old was he when he was a state of grace?  Wow, I saw that.  He was eight years old.  Oh, I would have thought old, but I was voted most likely to guess age incorrectly  when film discussions were taking place. 
[00:16:00]  He was amazingly good.  He was, uh, I saw that part of that recently where he's just fucking, like, he's, like,  all drugged out.  Yeah.  Cocksucker is great.  Romeo's Bleeding.  I don't know.  Is that when he played, uh, who are you playing that?  He played, um, the guy that Cary Oldman played.  Oh, see, I would have thought it was Oldman's character, but you're saying it was the role.  The guys would know nothing about the role.  I just recently saw it, though, for the first time.  It's an old movie.  Yeah.  Which is the one?  Oh, the professional is where he's screaming, get everybody.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Everyone!  Wow, he plays a great, ready-to-do-something-awful, drugged-out guy.  Yes.  Nobody plays a guy about to do something shitty better than a fucking old man.  But when he's ready to kill someone in the professional, he pops those poppers.  He's, like, and his neck bends, and he's all fucked up.  We're in, uh, True Romance.  Yes, that was another one.  Yeah, yeah.  Big bristesses.  Big bristesses.  What's this white boy doing?  It's, like, what are you?  He's sucking his teeth. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  It's so good.  So, uh, you got the old man in the playboy there.  I don't know about Mel.  He got drunk and said a few things.  But we've all said those things, he told the men's magazine.  Uh, referring to Gibson's infamous anti-Semitic tirade during a traffic stop, Oldman added,  said, the policeman who arrested him has never used the, uh, the word, oh boy.  Yeah, he said, he said nigger.  Oh boy.  Oh boy.  Oh boy.  He said the n-word.  Did you read further?  Wow.  Because it wasn't.  He said the n-word. 
[00:17:30]  Then I have to, uh, leave him alone.  No, no, the problem was he said nigger, but they said they didn't mind that.  It was when he stood up and he pop-locked.  Oh boy, he said it.  I would have liked to have seen that clip.  And he said it repeatedly and he just kept doing it to music and they're like, Mr. Oldman,  we're trying to interview you.  This is crazy.  This is too much.  What are you doing?  Stop pop-locking.  That's the truth.  He's using real language.  He said, the policeman who arrested him has never used the word nigger or that fucking Jew.  Ah, well.  And then he admits, I'm being brutally honest here, it's the hypocrisy of it that drives me crazy. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Very good.  There is a huge hypocrisy going on.  I see nothing wrong with what he just said there.  Did you read the part, though?  He admits, I'm being brutally honest here.  But everyone basically says shitty things.  Mm-hmm.  That's his point.  Where he goes, you're not going to be able to print some of this because it's going to  make me seem like a bigot.  When I read that, I wanted to hug him like, oh, can't we?  Ah, yeah, they won't print it.  Good point.  Yeah.  Don't put that down.  It doesn't look bad.  He didn't stop there.  Uh-oh.  Alec calling someone a fuck.  Oh, a fag.  Sorry. 
[00:18:30]  Ow, Kenny, you took my chair.  See, the stupid newspaper should be able to fucking write the words.  You're the news.  Oh, God.  They refuse to write the word.  Right.  When reporting the actual story.  You're reporting the story, so fucking spell out the words.  You're not calling anybody that.  It's the news.  It's the fucking news.  They said he caused an H.  I was like, have a fucking shot.  They won't say hullabaloo.  Oh, Alec calling someone a fag in the street while he's pissed off coming out of his building 
[00:19:00]  because they won't leave him alone.  I don't blame him, he said.  Okay.  Returning to the subject of the Braveheart star, he said Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews.  He said the wrong thing because he's actually, has actually bitten the hand that I guess  has fed him and doesn't need to feed him anymore because he's got enough dew.  There you go.  He's like an outcast, a leper, you know.  But some Jewish guy in his office somewhere hasn't turned, hasn't turned and said that 
[00:19:30]  fucking kraut or, or fuck those Germans.  Did they print kraut?  Uh, they did print kraut.  Wow, they printed kraut?  The Daily News actually said that effing kraut or eff those Germans.  Whatever it is.  We all hide and try to be so politically correct.  That's what gets me.  It's just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone that we all stand on this thing going, isn't that shocking?  It's so, he's right 100%. 
[00:20:00]  The Daily News sucks a dick.  Oh, shit.  You better, you best apologize.  And there's some bad qualities too.  Nah.  They just suck a dick.  Gary, like you, like you've said many times, you know, we, we all say we want honesty,  but then you get a guy being quite honest and well thought out.  Open dialogue.  And they attack him.  Let's have an open dialogue about all of this and really get it out on the table.  And the second you do, you're just condemned. 
[00:20:30]  So that open dialogue thing is bullshit whenever you hear somebody say it.  We need an open discussion about race.  We need open discussion about sexuality.  We, no.  Because the second you're honest, you're fucked.  At that point in the interview, the British performer seemed to realize that his own words  were probably as shocking.  Oh.  You have to, he says, uh, you have to edit and cut half of what I've said because it's  going to make me sound like a bigot.  Oh, Commissioner Gordon.  He was probably on the phone.  I'm guessing he did a phone in there.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Prank caller.  Prank caller.  The self-described libertarian continued to blunder on.  Blunder on?  This is what the Daily News has to say about it.  The blunder on, blasting Hollywood and the culture at large for what he called a double standard.  Mm-hmm.  That's exactly what it is.  It is.  It's right there in front of your face.  Gee.  Let's see.  He, uh, goes on.  Bill Maher joked about Ellen Gennaro as being a lesbian under the guise of satire while Baldwin 
[00:21:30]  got vilified for saying the same thing, and he claimed that Oscar voters who didn't support  12 Years a Slave were labeled racist.  There you go.  Is that true?  That was the allegations.  Um, it's not like he pulled that out of thin air.  Uh, there were many people that were saying it.  Right.  But, you know, he's a little more inside, uh, that whole scene than, than we are or the  Daily News is, I think.  I do have particular views and opinions that most of this town doesn't share, but it's not 
[00:22:00]  like I'm a fascist or a racist, Oldman told me.  I'll work on that, Harry.  Even the time...  There's nothing like that in my history, he says.  It says Planet Star Oldman rants in defense of Mel's slurs.  But he really, he's not defending, like, he's not agreeing with Mel.  He's defending Mel's right to just be an ass like everybody else is an ass.  They stretch the facts.  Yeah.  To make it more dramatic and edgy to sell fucking papers.  We all know that.  Daily News sucks. 
[00:22:30]  What he's saying is obvious to people.  It's, this isn't something that you really have to look into and be like, are people  hypocritical?  Are the people that are criticizing, uh, others for, for saying, uh, awful things, do they  say bad things when they're home alone or, you know, in their car or something?  Huh?  No, they do.  They do.  It's human fucking nature.  You can't take that out of a human being.  When you get angry, there's no filter that, that filters out politically incorrect, uh, 
[00:23:00]  language.  When you're seething mad, you're gonna go for the worst possible thing.  You can call someone or, uh, an impression you get of somebody.  It's just the way things are.  And to say that you never thought that or felt that way is a lie.  It's a fucking lie.  Well, we act like, uh, only a small percentage of society speaks this way.  Yeah.  When we all speak this way.  Of course.  Every single fucking person.  Yeah.  Speaks this way.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:23:30]  Whether it's right to someone's face or, uh.  Or at home being recorded, uh, without your knowledge.  Or hiding.  Mm-hmm.  On a fake account.  Yeah.  Or with just your friends in your house.  Everyone speaks like this.  You escalate on your way home.  Right.  Everybody.  This headline, Gary Oldman goes on profanity-laced tirade.  Profanity-laced tirade.  That's all they got out of that, by the way.  He was using some naughty, naughty words.  Look out.  He's an adult.  But I don't think that it was a profanity-laced tirade. 
[00:24:00]  No.  Bashing hypocrites who condemn Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin.  I think he was having a pretty, you know, intelligent discussion about what's going on.  Just a bunch of children.  No one wants to act like an adult anymore.  Or, with adult language and being able to handle, uh, hearing adult language.  Right.  What the fuck happened?  I don't know.  Holy gee.  I really think it was the Imus thing that put this in overdrive.  Yeah.  I really do. 
[00:24:30]  Well, I'm sorry I did that.  I think there were little inklings here and there.  But then, man, that happened.  And then everyone's...  Apologize.  The inklings.  Inkling Americans are going to be very angry.  You call them little.  Yes.  They like to be called pen-using Americans.  That's the ink.  Inkling.  But everyone popped up their heads and said, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What about our word?  Yeah.  What about us?  Hey, everyone has a word.  Don't you think certain groups that aren't getting the exposure that other groups are getting  would sit there and go, wow, you know, they got a word. 
[00:25:00]  And it really gets them exposure when someone uses this word and they pounce on them.  Right.  So why don't we get a word so that when someone says it, we could pounce and get publicity for  our group.  You don't think that motive is there when people come up with their alphabet soup of  fucking bad, bad words?  Of course it is.  That's the first and foremost.  That has nothing to do with how hurt anybody is or offended.  It's let's get our group in the news because some guy used the word we have now dubbed as 
[00:25:30]  an awful word and now we'll get some press.  It's great exposure.  Yeah.  That's just nonsense.  It's terrible.  I mean, we might as well talk to a wall, though, because this is not stopping.  We're not turning this one around.  We're going to turn this around.  So we'll all just make believe that this isn't just complete horse shit.  The facade everyone just erects. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  The facade when you go out.  Look at me.  I'm so tolerant and politically correct and I am such an amazing person.  Then you shut that door when you go home and oh boy, does shit leak out.  See, the only way to do it and not be hurt is I utter those slurs while I'm eating a vagina  and then no one knows what you're doing.  I'm down there.  I'm like, we don't have a goddamn juice.  Does a girl ever, like, look and tilt her head like a dog hearing a whistle? 
[00:26:30]  She's like, no, no, no, I'm just going to town down here.  You mind your beeswax.  Shut up.  You're enjoying it or not?  Yeah.  Hey, come already.  I'm bored.  How did vagina eating start, you think?  I bet it was very old caveman-y stuff.  Like when two dogs meet.  That's why I'm asking.  Yeah.  Because, you know, people didn't keep things as clean as they do today.  Oh, forget it.  It had to be a sick fuck.  Oof. 
[00:27:00]  The first caveman to go for something.  I bet you're spitting rocks and dirt out because they're squatting down.  Well, you're dragging your women around, so they were picking up everything.  Well, that's not true.  I don't think so.  I've seen the cartoons.  The hair with a club.  Right.  I'll tell you what happened.  Just scooping up everything on the ground.  They were eating, and a piece of turkey fell into her pubes, and two guys went down and  clunked heads trying to get it, and one just stayed down there and picked the turkey  out of her vag hair and ate it. 
[00:27:30]  Well, buffalo was probably a piece of, like, a delicacy.  Yes.  A mass of dawn.  Yes.  The hoof of a buffalo was a delicacy.  Hoof.  Yeah, and they would hollow it out and plant flowers in it.  Sam, can you look it up?  We need the answer.  How did vagina eating start?  I bet it's very old.  Very, very old.  I bet you it's the French.  I bet the Chinese, because those Chinese came up with a bunch of these weird Kamasutra  things.  Was that the Chinese or the Japanese? 
[00:28:00]  I don't know, but it wasn't that.  It was somebody fucking drawing a deer on a wall.  Yeah.  It was on a cave wall.  When she leaned up to do it, someone got behind her and ate her ass.  I mean, because there had to be a time where that had to be rough every single time.  Oh, boy.  Every single time.  Every time.  Oh, my God.  Maybe they could go down to the river or something and kind of tidy up back then.  You'd rub a rock over it.  A fucking 20-foot alligator doesn't eat her.  I think that's why they called it the Dark Ages. 
[00:28:30]  Yes.  Oh, man.  Imagine the bush on that.  Oh, God.  What do we got, Sam?  I'm looking for...  Let's put our learn on today.  Yeah.  I'm looking for a strong origin.  I haven't found an origin yet.  No.  No, but it dates back quite some time.  Oh, I bet.  I bet it's prehistoric, so...  I've got to go back 50 years, 100 years.  Maybe more there, Chippa.  Lebs.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  No, it's just accepted, but...  Oh, yeah.  There had to be a time, man.  You want me to do what?  What about the other way around?  With the chick fucking going down on a guy?  Like, where'd that start?  Someone pointed.  He picked up a club with his left hand, and he pointed...  And pointed to a bunch of cracked skulls in the corner of the cave.  And she misunderstood, and she bit it like a cigar.  And he hit her.  Another cracked skull. 
[00:29:30]  Well, Sam, you've got to look this...  We need some answers today.  All right?  Yeah.  You got anything yet?  What do you got so far, even though it might not be the best?  I mean, some people are saying it is impossible to even speculate on where oral sex originated,  but I can tell you this.  They are saying the earliest historical references to oral sex appear in Egyptian carvings.  Oh, those Egyptians.  So they were muff diving in the hieroglyphics. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  Really?  Yes.  Good for that.  Yep, yep.  Yeah.  The big sculpture of the spread-eagle woman in front of the Sphinx was destroyed.  That's actually what he was doing.  He was eating boxes.  He was eating boxes.  Yeah, all curled up.  Yeah.  Big sheepskin rug.  The pyramid's actually a bud plug.  Yeah, they say even in Pompeii, there was evidence of oral sex being depicted in paintings. 
[00:30:30]  Were people trapped in the lava licking box?  Because I know those Pompeii people, they got stuck pretty quick.  How embarrassing would that be?  Did they find you?  You were in the middle of licking box.  Years later, they find a void in the lava, and they pour something in there to get the mold.  Right.  And they take it out, and what is it?  Someone licking box.  Some guy on his back with his hand over his own lap, and some woman sitting on his face.  Oh, boy.  And there's some cuck in the corner jerking off.  Yeah.  They wouldn't know what he was doing, though. 
[00:31:00]  Apparently, he's ready to hold a fishing line.  No, we're just reading that image.  That's some fast lava in that Pompeii, huh?  Yeah.  They got people drinking their coffee or something.  Crazy.  I also don't have a problem with what the Detroit Tigers manager said.  What happened there?  We missed this story, because we got so busy.  He apologizes for a wife-beating joke.  Hmm.  What was the context? 
[00:31:30]  Well, Brad, I think it's awesomest.  Is known to be quick with a quib.  Quick with a quib.  Ew.  What's a quib?  I don't know.  Is known to be quick with a quib.  Are you sure it's not quip?  Well, probably.  Quip.  Yeah, quip is the word.  Quip.  Quip with a quip.  Yeah.  Of course it is.  But he strayed over the line Wednesday, and he knew it.  It started when he was asked after the 2-1 loss to the Kansas City Royals how he has been  able to keep his cool during his team's horrendous streak. 
[00:32:00]  He said this.  Oh, no.  Yeah, it's not fun, he said.  Like I said once, I get to the field.  I'm always in a good mood, especially if I'm driving and it's sunny out.  Once I'm here, I'm ready to go.  I feel like I'm the exact same person that you would have seen on day one of spring training.  And when he goes home, I beat my wife, Ausmus said.  Shit.  So every day, it starts off nice on the way to the ballpark. 
[00:32:30]  But if your team is kind of having a shitty run, he says when he goes home, I beat my wife.  But he quickly said, I'm just kidding.  No, luckily, my wife and kids are fantastic.  I do get a little mopey at home, but my wife and kids are good.  They've seen me be in a bad mood after a loss of they've been great.  Beat my wife.  But that's hilarious.  It's fucking hilarious.  And then he quickly explains exactly what his home life's all about.  Oh, my God.  So what's wrong with that?  Yeah, unless his wife is coming out with a black eye and busted nose and she's upset with it. 
[00:33:00]  Who gives a shit?  He made a joke.  His wife understands it.  So...  She better.  But play it.  He's on a way home.  Yeah.  But let's play this out.  He says, I beat my wife.  So then there's a guy somewhere going, oh, I guess it's acceptable then.  Oh, I'm going to go beat my wife now.  Why is that bad?  What is that going to do?  Especially with the explanation right after that. 
[00:33:30]  And obviously he was gold for the joke and I guarantee he got a big laugh.  Here's what it is.  Do we have the audio?  Oh, there's the audio.  You're making light of the wife beating.  That would be the argument.  You know, this is not a joking matter.  I don't go for that.  No, that kind of humor.  Pretty much everything is a joking matter.  You know, and I have a great sense of humor and I've laughed at a lot of things that are very...  I love that one.  Right.  I'm really fun.  No, you're not.  His...  Oh, okay. 
[00:34:00]  His joke drew some hearty laughs and some nervous laughs from the media.  Those are the people going, oh, fuck.  He's going to get in trouble for that.  Oh, here we go.  Let me file this.  By us.  Let me file this immediately.  Right.  After answering another question, came back to it.  I didn't want to make light of battered women, Ausmus said.  I apologize for that.  Delicious.  If it offended anyone.  So he knew.  Battered.  I just...  Right there.  Those two cutlets.  Vagina.  I just...  Dorable.  Melons. 
[00:34:30]  Yes.  He knew.  Let's hear the clip.  How are you when you go home?  I beat my wife.  Oh, man.  I'm just kidding.  No, luckily my wife and kids are fantastic.  Can take a punch.  I do get a little mopey at home.  A little mopey.  That's it, right?  Whoa.  That laugh, by the way, sounded like the laugh that Jake LaMotta got in the club.  Right.  He goes, uh, this is the toilet. 
[00:35:00]  I said, what's the toilet?  He said, you're in him.  Oh, let's go.  Let's go.  Get off the stage.  That was a raging bull-fucking club laugh.  That was just exhausting.  That's all the bullshit going on right now.  Yeah.  That's all the fucking...  That's all just bullshit.  Bullshit.  I don't think there's many people that will tell you that.  And I don't know why. 
[00:35:30]  No one on the mainstream media news programs will tell you that's bullshit.  But why can't they just break it down a little bit?  Right.  Right.  They don't have to agree or condemn it.  Just present it equally.  Why can't you...  Because I'm sure the Tigers manager thing was all over the place, right?  Yeah.  All the sports places.  But why can't they just break it down and go, he was going for an obvious joke there.  Yeah.  And then he explained that, you know, no, no, no, that's not the case whatsoever. 
[00:36:00]  I have a great family and they deal with my...  You can't even joke about it.  ...my openness after a loss.  You can't even joke about it, though.  People will say...  But why can't they...  Beating your wife is a great problem in this country and it's not a joking matter in any  circumstance.  I have no problem if they say that.  But why can't they present the story better and explain what he was going for there, which  was an obvious joke.  Because you'd probably get in trouble for even understanding that that was a joke.  Like the news would look bad. 
[00:36:30]  They would get letters going, why would you even say that it was a joke?  Right.  You know, people, ugh, yuck, get me off this planet.  I want to go to Mars.  I'm tired of this fucking piece of crap.  Yeah, we're going to lose the battle, though.  Oh, yeah.  We're absolutely going to lose this battle.  Maybe if more people like the great Gary Oldman push back, right?  No, now he'll be scared.  Of course. 
[00:37:00]  He will now be scared.  You think?  I think so.  He's a crazy motherfucker.  I think he's going to have to come out and explain some shit now.  Would you watch?  By tomorrow.  What do you mean, Matt?  Go fuck yourself.  I was simply trying to say this.  Yes, you're a wanker.  I wonder if he was drunk.  I don't even know if he drinks, but I'm just wondering.  He looks like he put a few ales down, huh?  That's the part about being really famous.  You never want to give an interview when you're fucking loaded. 
[00:37:30]  Your publicist is like, I don't know if you should do this right now.  Get him out of the fucking phone.  Get him out of the fucking car.  Yeah.  He's like, oh, no.  He has a few belts, I bet you.  Oh, there's something to say.  Yeah.  He's watching the news, and there's like some fucking, like, a bunch of black guys.  Be up a white car.  I'm ready to do that goddamn interview right now.  Someone has to say something about this.  And that someone is me, for fuck's sake.  How come they can say nigger on other movies, but I can't mind? 
[00:38:00]  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Jimmy the Greek was the first one, I think, that gave the drunk interview and paid dearly for it.  Oh, was he drunk when he did that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  He was sitting at a table with beverages in front of him.  It was like at some, you know, impromptu interview at an event of some sort.  Right.  And he was putting down a few.  And he was, like, actually sitting at his chair, and he's turned around, looking over 
[00:38:30]  the back of his chair to the guy that was interviewing him, and just going off.  Did he regret that?  Oh, well, he's dead now, so.  Oh, when did he die?  I think he doesn't regret anything.  Look, yeah, he's turned.  Yeah, he's like, hey, whatever.  Hey, oh, you got a camera and a mic?  Yeah, I'll talk to you.  Let's play this.  What do you got?  Yeah, let's hear it.  Because this is old, old school.  This is the first, like, real celebrity being fired for saying something about race or 
[00:39:00]  sexuality or whatnot?  Well, let's ask.  What year was it?  I think this is.  Is there one that came before Jimmy the Great?  Because maybe there's someone out there that knows better than us.  I don't really think so.  I think you might be right, but.  And he was the most visual, the most public figure.  He was huge at the time.  He was a huge star.  Whenever you saw the fucking Kentucky Derby, any of the horse races, he was handicapping  them.  The fucking football game.  Football, everything.  Like, everything.  You went, let's talk to Jimmy the Greek.  What do you think?  I think the fucking... 
[00:39:30]  You know, and then he gets up there and starts talking about the blacks and their muscles.  What year was this?  This was the 80s.  It was the 80s, right?  Yes.  I'm not sure the exact year.  Anybody?  Anybody?  Exact year?  Come on.  Come on.  Snap it up, pal talk.  You're on the clock here.  I remember being on the road.  I was with the dance troupe I was with at the time, and we were all so surprised in  the dressing room that we had been fired.  The dance troupe?  Yeah.  I'm getting one 1984.  I'm getting a 1980, an 85. 
[00:40:00]  You people stink.  Probably mid-80s, though.  87.  That is not one fucking...  No.  They're just yelling out numbers.  You guys rot.  You guys rot.  Early 80s.  84, maybe, right?  82.  I think it was early 80s.  82.  82.  1948.  2012.  One, someone's bidding a dollar.  You're an asshole.  All right.  It's early 80s, right?  Had to be.  He was born in 1918.  You know that much? 
[00:40:30]  No, it couldn't have been.  It wasn't 88.  88?  No way.  83.  Come on.  You guys suck.  Life and...  When was he fired?  One of those answers is probably correct, by the way.  Yeah, it's every fucking...  Someone you just yelled at.  Controversy.  Sam has an answer.  Sam?  88.  It was 88?  January 88.  I would have put it at a lot sooner than that.  I said 88.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Here's the clip that got him fired.  Yeah.  Jimmy the Greek.  Love it.  Probably the first guy. 
[00:41:00]  For the Greeks, the Jews, and for everybody.  I mean, let's make it a good for everybody.  Come on, Sam.  Come on, Sam.  A little preface.  Nightline.  Come on, preface.  Oh, my God.  What's going on?  Middle of the interview, Sam.  What's your nickname?  That's the clip.  Middle jumper.  All right.  I'm sure they're going to have to equalize it for the blacks, for the Greeks, the Jews,  and for everybody.  I mean, let's make it equal for everybody.  And is it equal?  What about the sports?  Well, they've got everything.  If they take over coaching like everybody wants them to, there's not going to be anything 
[00:41:30]  left for the white people.  I mean, all the players are black.  I mean, the only thing that the whites control is the coaching jobs.  Now, I'm not being derogatory about it, but that's all that's left for them.  The black talent is beautiful.  It's great.  It's out there.  The only thing left for the whites is a couple coaching jobs.  Maybe we need to get more black coaches.  Oh, it's all right with me.  I'm sure that they'll take over that pretty soon, too.  WRC was apparently flooded with complaint calls after Snyder comments were aired. 
[00:42:00]  Snyder issued an apology saying he was truly sorry.  They didn't complain of the rest, though.  A CBS spokesperson said no decision has been made as to whether Snyder will work Sunday's  NFL Today broadcast.  Snyder is spending the night with Gene Upshaw, the Players Union Executive Director in Washington,  and he has received support calls from Walter Payton and Ahmad Rashad.  He hung up on them immediately because he doesn't talk to those people on the phone.  That, uh, there was a longer clip, though, when he starts talking about you. 
[00:42:30]  Stop short clipping.  I have the audio for the black is the better athlete.  Do you?  All right.  Let's listen to that.  Is that from that interview or no?  This goes back all the way to the...  Here it is.  All right.  We got it.  When during the slave trading, the big, the owner, the slave owner would, would, would, would  breed his big black to his big woman so that he could have a big, a big, a big black kids.  In Washington today, the local NBC television station interviewed people about the state of  race relations on this Martin Luther King's birthday. 
[00:43:00]  Jimmy the Greek, Snyder, is in hot water tonight over some remarks.  Hot water.  He made today about black athletes.  Well, they've got everything.  If they take over coaching like everybody wants them.  Oh, and they just pick and shoot every little line.  Jack is a better athlete to begin with because he's been bred to be that way because of his  high thighs.  And I don't want this on.  I just...  There isn't much left for the white guys.  Whoops.  He's hammered, too.  He's fucking drunk off his ass right there.  You can tell he's hammered, right?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Looks like Grandpa Lewis. 
[00:43:30]  He does, yeah.  All right.  Oh, boy.  We got to take a break.  Joel McHale is, is waiting.  Is he hearing?  Standing by.  So we'll get Joel McHale in next.  We'll get Joel McHale in next.  Whatever happened to these guys.  Yeah.  Finger 11, I think. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  What year is that from?  Is that from like 2000 or is that newer?  These guys played it live on our show.  Was that any W this was out?  No.  Oh, I don't know.  But it was when we came back to radio.  The guy came in and performed it.  Like 2008 or 2009.  Oh, that...  For some reason, this really reminds me of old school, like 2001.  Does that sound like it, right?  Yeah.  Joel McHale.  There he is.  Hello, Joel.  Let's get energy up.  God damn GQ looking.  Look at that suit.  Why the suits?  Yeah, you're coming in here now. 
[00:44:30]  I'd look in.  That's right.  Look in shop.  And Kelly and Michael.  Oh, Kelly and Michael today.  Okay.  I thought I was going to look good wearing my Rockstar Games shirt.  You actually thought I would dress up like this for your show?  I thought so, but for radio, it is kind of silly.  Well, we hope so.  It is.  Are you excited about the new GT5 on PS4?  Yes, I am, because I have Xbox One.  And I have PS4, too, but I use the Xbox One a lot more, because I like going, Xbox, go  to TBS. 
[00:45:00]  And then it just turns on TBS, and I'm watching Sunfield.  And you don't feel at all like an idiot for screaming at just electronics.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  But you know what?  That convenience.  When the phone rings and you just go, Xbox, mute.  And then it mutes.  You're not searching for a remote.  He lives alone.  I do not live alone.  I have my cat, Beavis.  So he can yell at anything he wants.  And electronics that you talk to.  A lot of electronics that I talk to.  I have conversations with my Xbox.  It's wonderful.  Xbox, go to Netflix. 
[00:45:30]  You're like that guy in Blade Runner who had all the pet robots.  Yes, that guy.  And eventually was killed.  Oh, that didn't bode well for him.  No, his eyes got...  No, that was...  His friend's eyes got pushed in.  Spoiler.  You're right.  You know what?  Spoiler alert.  You're a spoiler.  You know what's great about that movie?  A lot of things are great about that movie.  It's a fucking great movie.  Yes.  But the image of the futuristic city where there were a lot of video billboards and whatnot.  That were enormous.  You look out.  Yes.  And now you look out and there it was. 
[00:46:00]  The Pan Am one kind of ruins it all.  Right.  Boy, they really thought Pan Am was going to be forever in the old movies.  Well, they should have had a TWA one.  Oh, did you hear?  Did you hear?  Oh, no.  Yeah, I'll tell you.  One major crash and now you're finished.  That's what it was.  The WakaBee and then Flight 100.  Oh, man.  That ended both of those airlines.  That's good.  I hope you ended an airline someday.  Why?  That would mean that I was injured.  Yeah.  How dare you?  Yeah, you're injured.  Injured.  I'm teasing, of course.  I'm teasing, of course.  I watched a great special last night on Smithsonian on the 747. 
[00:46:30]  And it's Inception and...  Television.  It only...  Smithsonian Channel.  Yeah.  747.  Go.  I love it.  Pause.  Hello?  I'm watching a special.  Xbox.  Yes, I'm busy.  Go to the Smithsonian.  It's hard to say after a few beers.  Yeah.  Actually, the Xbox...  Frigerator.  Beer.  Anthony, stop drinking.  Oh, so you can just tell what channel to look for?  Yes.  It's pretty cool.  And it knows... 
[00:47:00]  I have an Xbox.  I have a smart TV and an Xbox.  I don't know how to use them.  So I'm just like, Xbox on!  And it's just me alone and myself.  I don't have a plug-in right.  Your neighbor's like, plug it in!  It's still in the box.  I'm a fool.  It's in the box and he's talking about, unbox yourself!  Xbox, get out!  Get out of the Sprout legs!  Xbox Sprout legs!  No.  I don't know what I'm doing.  How was the special?  It was fantastic.  It's just...  It reminds you of a time when...  You know, this country was just fucking, like, motivated. 
[00:47:30]  In 28 months, they went from nothing...  to designing, building, and test-flying this massive airplane.  You might be running out of things to watch.  No!  It's amazing!  I love aviation!  That one sounds horrendous to watch.  Anyway, on the Bachelorette two nights ago.  Oh, my word.  They had actual footage of the test flight, and the test pilot, and the crew up there, and  the first Boeing 747, and then the problems that it had, and how they fixed it, and just 
[00:48:00]  watching it, you realize how amazing and great this country was with building.  Well, the one guy who came in and said, the reason it's not working is you have to have  two wings.  They really thought it would be a one-wing aircraft.  And it would just go on the runway, and hit through there.  They probably could have built it a lot quicker than 28 months.  If...  747!  Bills!  Go!  Xbox!  We haven't invented that yet.  Xbox!  Yeah.  People do forget that we thought...  We have invented that.  Great stuff. 
[00:48:30]  The 3D printers.  Well, that's true.  Oh, well...  Scary shit.  It's pretty good.  Yeah.  You have one?  I don't.  I can't.  You should get one.  No, my children would destroy it.  Oh.  They wreck everything, don't they?  Oh, Jeff Dunham.  Jeff Dunham has one.  Just has one.  And he's printing all the time.  Well, he makes his puppet heads.  How much does it cost?  He makes a puppet...  It depends.  I think, like, 20 large.  Something like that.  Is he still, like, the most successful comic in the country?  It's insane.  Yeah.  But he 3D prints all of his puppet heads and hands and stuff. 
[00:49:00]  Mm-hmm.  I'm sure his house is not weird at all.  Right?  Isn't that...  I'm sure it's not scary and just...  Dead eyes looking back at you all over the place.  I do ventriloquist.  Think about decorating your house with some 3D.  I should probably do.  I'm surprised you don't have one yet.  Puppets scare the shit out of me.  You should have one.  Nah.  Yeah, but then you'd be like, well, where do I put all the bodies?  That's true.  Well, I do have a big basement.  Do puppets scare you?  Crawl space.  I'm not a fan of puppets.  Like, if there's a puppet in the room, like in, um, uh, what, in the Poltergeist, when  that, uh, clown dummy thing was on the chair, and the kid, like, looked at it, and 
[00:49:30]  then the lightning hit, and it was a little closer, and then it was gone completely, went  under the bed.  Like, I always, I get like, I jump when I see things like that.  I hate jump scares.  Like, in real life.  In movies, it's fine.  But in real life, like, if I see something out of the corner of my eye, and it looks like  somebody, oh, ah, and it's just a curtain or something blowing.  So you are like a paranoid guy who lives alone, shouts at electronics, and then goes, hey, I 
[00:50:00]  saw a great special the other night.  Yes!  I watched aviation shows.  And he edited it.  You're basically a shut-in, kind of.  He added a Jaguar, too, yesterday.  Oh.  Yes.  A live Jaguar.  No, no, no.  The car.  Oh, that's coming.  The car.  Don't be surprised.  I picked up the F-Type, uh, R.  Thing is awesome.  Did they give it to you?  Did you get some deal?  No, I didn't get a deal, but, uh, you know, I bought it.  I had a great, uh, time at the Borgata, uh, a couple of weeks back. 
[00:50:30]  Oof.  And you made enough money to...  Uh, yeah, it was, it was, it was good.  It was good.  So I went in there, and, uh, I was like...  Do you have a parking space?  I want that.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's a bad...  And then, and then went, sir, and you went...  Don't do that to me.  I thought I saw somebody in the backseat.  There is no backseat, Anthony.  You've got to tell me about the blind spot in this car, because I will just hit the accelerator.  Very scary.  Go, go, go, go.  The radar detector talked to me. 
[00:51:00]  I was like, ah, it was in the car!  It beeped.  What?  Just tell me, warn me.  Yes.  Just beep, don't talk.  No, it's two-seater.  What color did you get?  I got white because the body lines on it are so nice.  Yes.  Because I'm a racist.  The body lines are so nice, and the black trim on it really shows up with the white,  and it doesn't really show up that good with any of the other colors.  Even though the other colors are very nice.  And I usually don't like white vehicles.  You hate the car.  I can't stand it. 
[00:51:30]  So why not the Porsche?  Well, the Porsche is a little more expensive, and you're not getting all that much more for  the price.  And I like the amenities in the Jag.  They're very nice.  And why not the Audi R8?  You weren't interested in that.  You know what?  I need a good-looking car, too, and I liked the way this car looks.  It's got that real brr, brr animal look, and the sound of the engine.  And you can bypass the mufflers, and it's just blowing right out the headers. 
[00:52:00]  Where you can turn off the mufflers?  Pretty much so.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just turn off the mufflers.  It's...  Oh, it's crazy.  I want to open that thing up through the Midtown Tunnel.  Oh, my gosh.  That's going to be great.  Let's just fucking piss people off.  Yes.  You can go at least 13 miles an hour.  Yeah, at least.  Yes.  I do have a thing in my car that says average speed for the intake.  Every trip you take, it tells you exactly how long you've been going.  Average speed. 
[00:52:30]  Average speed.  And I'll come from Santa Monica to Hollywood, and it'll be like 13 miles average speed.  Oh, nice.  13 miles per hour.  Slow it down there.  Come on, Joel.  Thank God it has 500 horsepower.  Yeah.  At any moment, this was ready to just rock it down up to that next light.  For 100 yards.  Driving it home yesterday, I had to go eastbound on the LIE at rush hour, so I was just sitting  there going, this is great.  I could have bought a Ford Focus.  You could have bought a Yaris.  Yeah, or that. 
[00:53:00]  I think you should have.  The Ford Fusion.  All electric.  Focus.  Fusion's a good car.  Yeah.  They all electric.  Sensible.  Oh.  Sensible car.  Sensible car.  I like a good sensible car.  When are you going to take it out and go crazy?  I'll take it out this weekend.  Drive it around.  But today, I'll probably venture somewhere.  Did you drive it into work?  Go to the bar?  No, no, no.  That is not a city vehicle.  That's what the old Escalade is for.  The battle wagon.  Nice.  No one fucks with that.  It must seem great where you're like, yep, bought a brand new car. 
[00:53:30]  Not taking it into work.  Not taking it into work.  Too scared.  Yeah.  The city's crazy.  Someone's going to ding it.  Yeah.  I just, I don't mind the Escalade getting a few battle wounds on it and stuff.  When trucks are double parked and you barely got enough room to get through, I've mastered  the art of the electronic side view mirrors pulling them in.  Yeah.  You could just hit a button and they pull in and you shoot right through that spot and  you barely make it. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  Wow.  It's exhilarating.  Have you ever seen any specials on it?  No.  No, but I'm thinking of filming one myself.  Maybe even starring Joel McHale.  I would love to host that.  Folks, big deal today.  Yes, sir.  How will this truck get through this tiny space?  You know, when you're in the moment, it's New York City.  It sort of is like a GTA kind of a thing going on.  Just going for my...  Pulling it. 
[00:54:30]  Well, yeah.  Well, now our mayor here, de Blasio, he just signed a bunch of bills that restrict drivers  because he's trying this zero...  What is it?  Zero vision zero?  He's trying to whittle down...  Vision zero?  Yes.  Or something like that.  David Patterson originally came up with this.  Or zero vision.  He's trying to make it so there are zero people killed by cars.  Pedestrians hit by cars in the five boroughs. 
[00:55:00]  Well, that is a very good thing to try.  It's a noble cause and everything.  Right.  But he's putting all of the weight...  The onus.  The onus on the drivers.  Wow.  Slowing them down.  Speed restriction zones.  A lot of people.  Landmines.  Landmines are good.  Landmines.  But he's putting none of it on the pedestrian.  Who, by the way, if you get hit by a car that hasn't jumped up onto a sidewalk, it's  your fucking fault. 
[00:55:30]  That's how I feel.  Well, that's not the law, though.  No, it's not the law.  In Great Britain, that is the law.  Really?  If you are just in the street and a car hits you, you shouldn't have been there.  Imagine if a car was coming during that Abbey Road picture.  Oh, my gosh.  Wipe out the Beatles.  Totally different album.  And you could just go home and go to sleep because it wouldn't be your fault.  No.  You know, I hate to be serious, but that would have been very, very tragic.  Tragic, probably.  Literal Jim.  Thank you. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, but put some fucking responsibility on the pedestrian's part.  I see it all the time.  There's a red light for them.  They have a don't walk sign.  Don't walk.  And it's green for me, let's say.  And somebody decides they have enough room to make it across.  And I'm stumped coming at them, but the first guy has enough room.  The person behind that person just sees this other guy step off the curb and start crossing. 
[00:56:30]  And looking at their phone or the back of someone's head, they go right along with him, not realizing he's just about going to make it.  And now I have to step on the brake, blast the horn, flip the bird, blurt out a racial epithet.  It's exhausting.  And the guy was white.  That's the inappropriate guy.  There's no reason to throw that in there.  You Irish.  Yes.  Why you?  I shake my fist.  Go back to Dublin.  You potato blight.  Man, you have a hard life here. 
[00:57:00]  It's so difficult.  Los Angeles, they don't even, it's not even a conversation yet.  No.  They don't even, there's no left turn signals in Los Angeles.  Yeesh.  For real.  There's nothing.  What happens there?  That's kind of weird.  Can you write on red there or no?  You can write on red.  But it's an unspoken law or thing that three cars will stack up in the middle of an intersection  and then when their light turns red, everyone dashes across the traffic.  Goes and then the other side continues.  And if it's more than three, people are like, hey, what do you think you're doing?  This is not, we all have made an agreement. 
[00:57:30]  And you're violating it.  You're in trouble.  So it's, and there's potholes.  Well, that's a, you, all these people have big SUVs and four by fours.  And I go, because there's potholes that will end your tires.  We also have it very hard as you do.  Absolutely.  I see.  I don't know how we do it.  The arrow here is a great thing.  I love the left turn arrow.  But if you're at the front of that line, you better pay attention.  Because there's nothing worse than watching that arrow pop on and then seeing nothing. 
[00:58:00]  No one turning, nothing.  Someone's texting.  There's some other worse things.  No.  Childhood cancer?  Eh.  Close.  Close.  I will, I will lay on the second.  It's like, arrow.  Bip!  Arrow, bip!  Jeez.  You, you, you are awful when you're not here.  I'm when he is.  I'm a terrible person.  Exactly.  What are you talking about?  So as soon as it turns, you're just honking at the person.  Because, especially if I'm in a position where I'm like, if, if everyone doesn't pull 
[00:58:30]  this off perfectly, I'm going to be the guy that's stuck here.  And none of them will even know.  They'll be on their merry way, like, oh, I made that turn.  Leaving me in the, in the dust over there, waiting for the next cycle.  And those left turn arrows, they don't come around very often.  Your level of stress is shocking and disturbing.  Hence the, uh, drinking.  And the yelling at electronics.  How, it's, uh.  So you get home from a stressful drive of honking at people and barely getting through two spaces. 
[00:59:00]  And you're just like, Xbox on.  Xbox.  Go to Call of Duty Ghost.  And then I'll start playing Call of Duty Ghosts.  I'll put the headset on and listen to, uh, 12-year-olds, uh, stab me.  And I'll curse at them.  Well, really?  I have a machine gun.  You have a knife.  And they still get you.  Yeah.  It's like we've had a counseling session.  How was the, uh, correspondence dinner?  It was great.  I, uh, oh.  I actually was asking you to understand you attended. 
[00:59:30]  Holy shit.  Here was the problem with the dinner.  You had a problem with the metal detectors.  I don't think Joel needed to be here today.  Right?  I learned a lot.  It was very, it was good.  It was very stressful.  It was stressful, but good.  You did a great job.  Thank you.  Really good job.  God bless you.  The, uh, kudos you were getting from a lot of the people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some hated it, which was what I expected.  That's kind of, that's kind of a positive question.  That always happens, right?  Who hated it?  Well, a lot, well, a lot of. 
[01:00:00]  Someone named President Obama.  He liked it.  He said, he said nice things afterwards.  Yeah, he absolutely did.  I don't imagine that he liked the drone strike joke, but.  Eh, you know, he's got to take, uh, all that.  Yeah, I'm, I, I thought people would be shocked by the, uh, not shocked, but more incensed by the Clinton joke.  But people were like, no, that was fine.  That was fine.  That was totally fine.  I also love the, the, uh, veal joke.  I forget the guy's name now.  The bun, the Cliven Bundy ranch.  Yes.  Uh, line, which I thought was really funny.  Yes.  You had a lot of great ones, man.  I was not, I've never been more prepared or freaked out for something in my life. 
[01:00:30]  And he did very well.  Oh, I mean.  Laugh wise.  He got laughs.  Oh, Clint, I mean, uh, Obama.  Yeah.  He kills.  Yeah.  He killed, he is killed every year.  He's by far the best at it, at that any other president.  He had some edgy stuff in there too, man.  Yeah.  He told, uh, Malaysian flight joke.  Yep.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty crazy.  The whole crowd went, Ooh, that's the entire crowd's reaction.  He said, fuck off.  Yeah.  Something like that.  He did. 
[01:01:00]  It's very similar.  But the whole time, it's like, Ooh, it's like everyone's watching fireworks.  Yeah.  The whole time.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  A bunch of really powerful people who've spent their lives, like, gaining power and money.  And, and just, they go, Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  We said that thing.  But when it was over, I've never been more relieved.  How was the dinner?  Yeah.  It's bizarre and wonderful because you're getting ready to do the gig of your life.  Yeah.  So, and then you're sitting with the first lady for two hours. 
[01:01:30]  Wow.  And you, she's absolutely lovely and wonderful.  She's charming.  She's great.  Very smart.  And then you're like, then the whole time, I'm just going to, you might quietly freak  out over here.  Ooh.  What's the small talk like between you and Michelle?  She, uh.  What are you guys talking about?  Is she really good at it?  Yeah.  I imagine she's really good at it.  Very good at it.  We were talking about, I mean, she, the, you'd be amazed how up to date on like pop culture  and television they are.  Right.  I mean, they, they take time to watch the, you know, I think they watch probably, I don't 
[01:02:00]  know, an hour a night.  But, uh, but they know what's going on.  Um, so, uh, they asked about community.  They asked about the soup and watch the soup with community.  I was like, yeah, this gig will probably definitely get us picked up.  Oh, yeah.  Then we heard.  Thanks a lot.  President Obama.  Uh, no, but we talked about, um, cause we, you know, she had a big health initiative and  we were talking about healthy food and she, I have to give her again, she's very cool about 
[01:02:30]  she's like, you can eat whatever you want.  Just don't eat everything you want all the time.  And I thought that was a very good, she's like, have the, have the stuff that you want,  but just have it, you know, once a week or twice a week.  It's not, it shouldn't be your meals.  A can of lard once a week.  Right.  Yeah.  But she, uh, she's got a hamburger on her windowsill from McDonald's that has sat there  for six years and has not.  Her windowsill is the White House, right?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, yeah, it's not, actually it's not, I don't think it is, I don't want to say it's 
[01:03:00]  McDonald's, so I'm not going to make sure.  It has to be, whatever it is, it's got to be just the package.  It can't be the whole burger.  It is a burger with nothing on it, with, with no packaging on it.  And has sat there for six years and nothing, because they wanted to, with all the additives  and preservatives and the thing, and she was saying how it has not changed in six years.  Nothing has landed on it.  It has not, it has not, there is no mold, nothing has changed, it is unchanged and sits  there and nothing happens.  I bet the Secret Service changes it every day. 
[01:03:30]  They probably, like, put a fresh burger, get a, get a fresh burger, put a fresh burger  there.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  I thought, I didn't realize it was an experiment.  And it's still hot.  I want to try the steam coming off and it still smells good.  We are so sorry.  What, terribly miscommunicated.  Yeah, we, we talked about, we talked about the Bachelorette, I think.  Wow.  Yeah, so.  Was there any point where you looked over while you were telling jokes and you see the  president at Alaska, that would be a tremendous high.  Yes, it would be, it was, it was just tremendously strange and great, but, and it was also, when 
[01:04:00]  you look out into the crowd, you recognize everyone looking back at you.  Oh, man.  It was like being in a wax museum.  Oh, that's, this is, look at all these people that I, that are.  I've seen them.  Yeah, there's like Robert De Niro's right there, and you're like, yeah, there's that guy who's  a national treasure, and now I'm going to make fun of him.  Oh, but it was, it was, it was still, I still look back on it and it's like, well, that  strangest moment of, and most kind of exhilarating.  Yeah.  Of my life. 
[01:04:30]  That's like being thrown out there.  Yeah.  My kid, we introduced him to the president.  We just introduced him to the president.  But you have a private little audience with the president, you and 200 other people.  Did you just start bitching about stuff?  Look, you.  Yeah, I was like, what's going on with the trains?  Hey, come on.  How come, why are they so slow in our country?  Well, I thought we were getting fast trains.  Bullet train, right?  Yeah.  It's time.  I feel like we've been saying this for 30 years.  Oh. 
[01:05:00]  It's trains.  Come on.  It's more like just shake his hand.  Hi.  Hello, sir.  You're so great.  Hi.  Yeah.  200 people.  You don't get any time, really.  You get about two minutes.  Really?  Yeah.  What'd you do with your two minutes?  Yeah.  What'd you do with your two minutes, Joel?  I vomited onto him.  That would have lost control of myself.  Lose your balance.  Yeah.  They were very personal.  I had all, I invited my entire family.  So they were, I was dragging 11 other people around.  Were you nervous or was it so overwhelming that you handled it? 
[01:05:30]  Okay.  The meeting of him or the gig?  The meeting.  No, that was, I was so concerned about what was coming on later that I don't know if I  could, I mean, it was, the moment was like, this is great.  Okay.  I might be, I might be killed in just a few hours by a group of people upstairs.  So I was, I was guarding my jokes.  I had them in a binder.  I felt like launch codes to something and I wasn't going to, but my kid for real started  vomiting right before we met.  Oh, man.  And then I thought, are we going to infect the president? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  This would be great.  I started vomiting right after he was elected.  Oh my gosh.  Let's see that.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  Toilet open.  Open toilet sink.  That's a great idea.  Paws it on.  Pause, Xbox.  Jeez, I'm going to vomit.  Was your kid nervous or sick?  Sick, for real.  Oh, wow.  Oh, man.  And we all got sick two days later.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And I would tell my agents.  So Obama might have got sick, but he can't tell the country he's sick. 
[01:06:30]  He has special medicine.  Oh, I'm sure.  He's got the good stuff.  Yeah, but I told my agents after that, I was like, yeah, I got sick on Monday.  They're like, yeah, of course you did.  It was a big letdown act.  I was like, no, no, no.  It was sick.  It was not nerves releasing or adrenaline flowing out of me.  I was really ill.  And it happened on the plane.  Oh, wow.  That's terrible.  That's the worst.  Air Force One?  Yeah, it was Air Force One.  No, it was Air Force Four, which was Jimmy Carter's plane. 
[01:07:00]  And they still fight around.  No, we, so they got sick, and then we were heading towards, we had stayed out all night  for like the last couple nights thinking, okay, we're just a little bit tired, maybe a little bit.  We went into the bathroom right before we got on the plane, and my wife and I were like, are you feeling okay?  Oh, no.  And we're like, we're still, we're going.  And then, thank God, we were in first class.  That's all I want to wear.  I say that every time.  Would you be?  Jesus.  Because if we weren't on the aisle, we would have, it would have been, we, that plane would 
[01:07:30]  have been patient zero.  That we would have been.  Are you shitting?  Puking.  Well, my wife was puking, and I was shitting.  Oh, wow.  But it would have been like 12 monkeys when we got out of there.  Right, yeah, yeah.  Maybe you got food poisoning from the White House.  No, because my kid got sick two days before.  Right.  Then we got sick two days later, and we, it was, I think I must have gone, and my friend,  the guys who helped me write, the correspondence dinner, their name, Boyd, Vico, and Brad Stevens  were sitting right next to me, and they just, every time I'd come back from the bathroom, 
[01:08:00]  they'd look at me just like, you poor man.  Oh.  And I was, and this is going to sound horrible, but I was burping the whole time, too.  I was just concentrating for five hours, just like, don't, don't.  And so my wife and I were just tag teaming.  Wait, don't puke, you mean?  Don't puke.  I was having it come out, you know.  Oh, wow.  You better off taking dumps, though.  That's the vomiting on a plane.  Stop with your medical jargon.  I don't know.  Some would say.  I would go with puking.  No way.  Because if it's the type of shitting he was going through, you can't control that. 
[01:08:30]  Puking's a lot faster to get done with.  Now, with that queasiness, that fucking, how many times did she throw up?  More than twice?  Oh.  The whole flight.  Oh.  Fifteen times.  And then you're going down, and you feel like the air cabin pressure changing, and you're  like, I'm going to vomit.  Oh, fuck that.  Oh, it was, and I, I, I, we really, the entire time, we're just going back and forth.  What a letdown after.  Awful flight.  I was just, after a great gig.  Two nights ago, I was entertaining the president.  Oh, my God.  And now I'm defiling a plan. 
[01:09:00]  Exactly.  And then, as soon as we got home, my nine-year-old started puking.  So we, and the entire family.  Food poisoning.  They didn't like one of your jokes.  Absolutely.  They were giving you a little taste.  They gave you something.  To keep you in line.  I knew it.  Yeah.  A little eye drop on your flight.  Right.  Something on his food.  Put something in his food.  Just a little bit.  That joke.  Right.  A little bit.  That's what he sounds like.  Kid looked a little peaked.  Give me, give me the presidential shot.  Ugh.  But I lost a few pounds.  Weren't you glad, by the way, that it didn't happen?  Imagine if that happened the morning of the gig.  Could you imagine?  Oh, man.  I don't know what I would have done.  You have to get, yeah, I guess you have to get a doctor to shoot you up with something 
[01:09:30]  if they can.  Is there anything they can give you?  I don't know.  You could have cortisone.  That's just the first thing that pops in my mind.  Cortisone.  Just shoot me up with cortisone.  It's good for, like, a couple hours.  I don't know what I would have done.  That would have been amazing, actually.  It would have been.  There would have...  Projectile vomiting on the president would have just been amazing.  I probably would have just died from exhaustion trying to...  Yeah.  What would they do if you literally could not perform?  They would just close with Obama.  If they had to, they would just do Obama because he's the... 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  He's the guy.  Yeah, he's always really good.  To make you follow him, that sucks.  We didn't even talk about the movie.  That's why you're here.  Yeah, we got to talk about the movie.  I know you have to get out of here.  Yeah, we got Kelly and Michael, guys.  Let's not dilly-dally.  I got to get over to CNN.  Buzz Aldrin said that to me.  Yes.  I asked you a question.  He told me I was dilly-dally.  Oh, is he a curmudgeon?  Oh, he did?  He's not a nice man, Joel.  No, he's a douche.  I've been to space.  Yeah.  Went to the moon.  What have you done?  That's exactly what it is. 
[01:10:30]  And I didn't even argue with him.  He's right.  He gets a...  I walked on the moon pass for everything.  Yeah, he really does.  Sit.  He's very ordinary.  Walked on the moon.  Be as nasty as you want to be.  But he should be the last person that's pissed about anything.  Yeah.  He walked on the moon.  He has seen the earth for how insignificant it is.  Yeah.  And perhaps...  Maybe I need that.  Maybe I need to look at the earth and go, you know, we're all just here on this big  blue marble.  No, you need to see the earth for the beauty it has.  You already see it for how insignificant it is.  Yeah, that's true.  There's little worms on it that should be crushed. 
[01:11:00]  You people are ants.  Terrible.  I can't believe this.  I've been tricked.  Turning into Regis.  Buzz Aldrin.  The movie.  Let's do the movie.  Yes.  Deliverance from Evil.  It's called Deliverance.  Oh, you're scary.  I thought I read it wrong.  I'm trying to make reading mistakes because I'm cute.  It's in theaters July the 2nd.  Yeah.  There's no other movies opening.  No.  It's not like Melissa McCarthy's coming in here later to promote a movie that opens the thing.  No, no, she is.  What?  She actually is a literal Jim.  Oh, my gosh, you guys. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, boy.  She's going to be here in about a half hour.  Shit.  Damn.  Leave it.  There's no reason people can't see both movies on the same day.  You know what?  Oh, Jimmy.  They're very similar experiences, too.  You and Eric Bana, who I really like.  Yeah, he's great.  He's pretty good.  He's a very handsome man.  You ever see Chopper?  I saw it.  Yeah, Chopper's amazing.  Yeah.  I don't remember it, but I remember loving it.  It was really violent.  Go see Chopper.  Yeah.  Is he in that?  You ever see Hulk?  Yeah, I've seen him.  You ever see Star Trek?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Keep going. 
[01:12:00]  You ever see Astronauts, Time Traveler's Wife?  Oh, he was in that.  Yeah.  That's right.  He's in a lot.  He's very good.  Oh, the recent one with Marky Mark, a soldier.  Yeah.  Is he Army of One, whatever?  No.  No.  It's, you know, Sole Survivor, Lone Survivor, Lone Survivor, Lone Survivor, Last Man, Last Man Standing.  Lone Survivor.  A hat for, um...  A hat for, the hat, the hat for the soldier guy.  For Algernon? 
[01:12:30]  Wow.  What a reference.  So you play a cop, uh...  Yeah.  I think I came in last summer, and I was doing this at the time.  Oh.  Thank you.  We shot it in the Bronx a year ago, and now you come and go, hey, remember that thing  I did a year ago?  Remember, like, an exact year ago?  Yeah.  You're on a rule.  That's gotta be weird.  We've all aged.  You're on to new things, and now you have to go backwards to promote this.  That's gotta be a little strange.  Yeah, it's hard.  It is, right?  It reminds me of making a left turn in New York City.  It's not an arrow. 
[01:13:00]  You've gotta lay on that hook.  Go!  I'm doing well.  Bring BAM!  Bring BAM!  What is it about?  It's about, uh, demonic possession.  Oh.  It's a serious movie.  Oh, damn.  There's lots of...  I get into a knife fight, a lot of, like, kids getting killed, and lots of violence and  blood.  Is it scary?  It's a scary movie.  Gonna jump?  Did you see the movie Sinister?  Yes.  It's the same guy who wrote it.  All right, that's pretty scary stuff.  You know, like, in Sinister, there's kids getting run over by lawnmowers and drowning  in pools, and... 
[01:13:30]  Oh, man.  So, this is, you know, this is a much harsher version.  I'm gonna jump?  You will jump.  I'm gonna...  Before the movie starts, I'll jump.  You will be the weirdo that's dragged out of the theater.  This is exactly what I don't like!  I hate this!  People are scaring me!  Yeah.  When's the premiere?  Like, when is the actual...  Premiere is tonight, but July...  Literally, July 2nd, is the opening of this Melissa McCartney movie, and this little...  This indie movie called Transformers. 
[01:14:00]  Transformers, with the Marky Mark.  It's a great weekend.  Yeah.  Look, we were there first, and then everyone showed up.  It was like...  But I feel like we're gonna beat everyone.  Yeah, you hear that, Melissa.  We have very similar movies.  Yeah.  I might actually be at the premiere tonight.  Oh.  I made that up.  Please?  I'll give you a ticket to it if you want.  Thanks, man.  I can't.  I gotta work.  I'd fight this out like I was really cool and in the know.  If I have a gig.  Do you know Olivia Munn?  We've had her on, yeah.  She's on.  She wouldn't stop texting me. 
[01:14:30]  What do you want?  This is a good problem.  Why would you complain about that?  Because I'm like, come on, enough.  How many nude pictures do I need?  I've seen you.  Thanks, nice, but I'm not interested.  What is wrong with you guys?  I'm busy.  He's got a brand new car he's already complaining about.  I know.  I'm bitching and moaning.  These models that keep texting me.  They won't stop.  Come on, Jim.  Leave me alone.  Winky face.  TV on.  Xbox on.  Xbox.  Make her go away. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, come on.  I don't appreciate the vulgarity.  What if someone finds my phone?  Xbox, delete nudes.  Oh, my God.  And your phone just explodes.  Or the phone goes, what news?  Is that burger really on a thing?  That was true.  And I don't want to say it was McDonald's.  Maybe whatever it was.  Is it a Tupperware or something, though?  It could have been.  Right.  How is it presented?  Is there Tupperware around it or anything?  It is.  There's no lid.  Nothing.  It's a shrine.  Sits in a windowsill on a plate. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, you could just eat it.  It's crazy.  Is it on a cam so we could check it out?  Yeah, I don't think it's on a cam.  She should have made a cam.  Right?  So we could check it out.  I'd watch Burger Cam.  Get a little drop cam on there.  Well, why didn't you think of that?  I wouldn't watch Burger Cam.  Yeah, I'd want to star in the movie.  White House Burger Cam.  That probably would have been better than White House Down.  Yes.  But what's her point?  I'm kidding.  That movie was involved.  If no one could see the thing and she doesn't really talk about it, what's the point?  Apparently she does talk about it.  She has talked about it, I think. 
[01:16:00]  Where?  She yaps to everyone that sits next to her about it.  Joel is not going to be able to keep a secret.  I'll tell you about my burger.  I'm preaching it all over the place.  All right.  She knew.  She knew it would finally actually get out.  Her kids, too.  She's probably like, the kids probably, if they want to eat like shit, she's like, look  at that thing.  It hasn't budged in fucking hell.  It's a pretty good deterrent.  She goes, look at that thing.  It hasn't done anything in six years.  And she points at her husband.  I didn't know what you were going to do.  I didn't know what you were going to do.  Oh, my God.  See what I did.  She's terrible.  We're having fun, man.  He's friendly.  I'm the bullet train.  I know.  You're a personal friend now, and I apologize. 
[01:16:30]  So what did you say to him when you met him?  What did you say, like, when he walked over?  Hi.  How are you?  Me?  I'm fine.  That's going to be a lot of fun.  What are you?  Do you feel a little insignificant when you meet the president?  My kid, what he knew.  Even though you have a great career?  Oh, yes.  I don't have command over armies.  But you realize.  He could blow up the earth.  That's pretty good.  The number of things that he deals with compared to, I mean, yeah. 
[01:17:00]  But my kid walked right up to him, and I said, I go, when you meet the president, you shake  his hand, and you look him in the eye, and he's like, all right.  And he walked up to him, and he goes, hi, are you Edward?  And he goes, I'm Eddie.  Oh, man.  Nice.  So I was like, yeah, that's my kid.  He just corrected the president.  Right.  I mean, technically, the president wasn't wrong, but still.  Yeah.  He made it more familiar.  Good for your son.  Yeah.  I'm Eddie.  It was just.  Nice.  I'm Eddie Barry. 
[01:17:30]  He's got balls.  He said, uh, he said, Barry.  How close is a guy to him?  Is there really a guy behind him carrying a football suitcase at all times?  Uh.  There's that rumor that there's that.  No, it's like a college-sized football.  It's literally a football.  Full of it.  Full of it.  Full of it.  Full of it.  Full of it.  Full of it.  Launch coats, and they have to deflate it, rip it open.  Mm-hmm.  Ah.  There is, there's people everywhere.  And so when, like, you can't, a lot of, they're off to the sides, but you, if you were  to, I, my, I'm assuming you would not, uh, be able to do a thing. 
[01:18:00]  But in that setting, they might be a little more relaxed.  Yes.  And they, those people, yes.  Well, they had our ideas, IDs, excuse me, they had all my ideas.  I don't know how they do that.  Yeah.  How did they do that?  But they had, you know, they, the, the, the background checks had been done and all  that stuff.  So that had already been, that had been done.  You should have impromptu, you just go into that, uh, Travis Bickle speech to the Secret  Service guy.  Great.  Yes.  You know, hey, I know what that is.  And, you know, I'm looking to become a Secret Service agent.  He probably would have gotten a big laugh out of it. 
[01:18:30]  He's like, ah, well, why don't you write your number down right here?  Write your number down.  Six digits straight.  Ironically, De Niro was there in the room.  See?  Yeah, there you go.  He should have gone into this.  He should have.  It would have been huge.  We've learned a lot.  Did you meet him?  He did today.  Uh, De Niro?  Yeah.  Yes, afterwards.  Picture?  We had a picture?  Uh, I did not get a picture.  Uh, neither did Demi.  It's in my heart.  Okay?  I remember here.  Jimmy wants a picture with De Niro.  That's why I bring it up.  No, but I did.  I made fun of him and I was like, uh, are you going to hit me?  And he was very nice. 
[01:19:00]  When the President's there, they're like, De Niro and all those guys are just second rate.  Yeah.  When you get Obama there, yeah, he cares about those guys.  But they'll probably, you know, allow you to get a picture because Obama's in the room.  Of course.  They'll be like, yeah, fuck, you can take a picture of me.  Did you get one of those good presidential pictures, though, where you're shaking hands  and looking at the camera kind of a thing?  Right.  Like we were just on a peace deal?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's nice.  And where did you meet?  Was it one?  Oval Office?  No, no, no.  He came to the hotel.  That's where.  Oh, I see.  That's where the reception is.  You didn't go to the White House?  We did go.  We had a tour of the White House.  Oh, so you saw the Oval Office? 
[01:19:30]  What?  You saw the Oval Office?  Well, we couldn't.  I have seen it before.  Oh, excuse me.  On a different tour.  Excuse me.  Someone's bragging.  But, look, you brought it up.  Walked right into it.  You're right.  We couldn't go there because that day, Angela Merkel, the leader of Germany, was there.  And they were trying to figure out what they were going to do with Putin.  That's sex possible.  Yeah, my older brother was like, I don't know.  Why can't we go over there?  I'm like, they're working out the world right now.  That's working out the world.  Sure.  Why don't you let them figure out?  Let's go look at the movie theater. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you know?  Here's a fun fact about the White House.  Did you know at one point they had four elephants walking around there?  What?  One president was given elephants.  And there was one thing that was like, well, we're going to put the elephants.  Who would give the president elephants?  Had it be a long time ago.  Yes.  It was like 100 years ago.  Where did they walk around?  The grounds.  Just walking around.  Just walking around the property.  And they finally had a huge barbecue.  Oh, it must have been a Republican thing. 
[01:20:30]  No.  Oh.  It was not.  I thought it was like, hey, look.  I think it was before even the...  Before they did that?  Before it was all...  Donkey elephant thing?  Yeah.  It was way before.  The wigs?  Was it the wig party?  It was the wig party, yes.  Yeah.  The wigs.  Those wacky wigs.  I should have gone out on the elephant story.  Yeah.  No, no.  No, no.  I've been abstracted myself.  We actually got to get you out of here.  Yeah.  We got to prepare for our Melissa McCarthy.  We got to prepare for that.  Delivers from Evil.  Only movie opening on July 2nd.  Yes.  That's right.  Only movie opening.  Great date movie. 
[01:21:00]  It is.  Yes.  Because the girl gets scared.  Which means it sounds like you won't be going then.  Oh, well, I'll probably be home with my Xbox.  Date.  Inflate.  And tell Olivia...  Inflate.  Tell Olivia I said hello and just enough.  All right.  I'll let her know.  Enough.  Jimmy.  She'll be like, you're kidding.  He said that?  Yeah.  It's frustrating.  Then she'll cry and then I'll take you.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  I've heard it all before.  I'll let her know.  All right.  I'm leaving.  Joel McKellar.  Thank you, Joel.  Hi, buddy.  Deliver us from Evil. 
[01:21:30]  Digging through the history.  Here's our 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony Radio Gem.  Hey, guys.  Let's say hi to Bob Kelly.  Bob.  What's up?  What's up?  Hi, fella.  Colin was in the other day, and he was telling us a story about you and Seinfeld, and it was  a little embarrassing.  Yeah, that frigging son of a bitch Seinfeld douchebag. 
[01:22:00]  Would you like to tell us the story?  Yeah, I feel like I'm on The Tonight Show right now.  Hey, Johnny.  Remember when he was filming Comedian?  Yeah.  Yeah, Seinfeld.  Well, he was, that son of a bitch was coming down with this little camera crew, and I never  talked to him.  I never said nothing to him.  I never say nothing to famous people when they come down there, and there's certain comedians  You're talking about the Comedy Cellar, by the way, where most of that movie Comedian  was filmed.  Yes. 
[01:22:30]  Thank you.  Where all the big-time New York comics hang out when they're not on the road.  Right.  All right, there you go.  Sorry.  Thanks.  So, this son of a bitch comes down.  I never say nothing to him.  One night, he says something to me.  I say something back.  I feel like we build up a rapport.  Rapport?  You know what I mean?  Like, it was organic.  What did he say?  Excuse me?  Yeah.  What's the code?  Because there's a door code to get down.  Is this seat taken?  Well, you know, it was kind of like a little conversation we had. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  So, when I did this gig up in Buffalo, two days later, the worst gig of my life, I have  to hire my own driver to pick me up to drive me to the gig.  This guy picks me up in a van, one of those, you know, one of those, you know, cool vans  with the captain seats and the TV and the, you know, VCR.  Nice.  So, he's got every Seinfeld episode ever, ever, ever. 
[01:23:30]  And he's got headphones on.  And he's not watching and he's listening to them.  Jesus.  This guy's a Seinfeld freak.  So, we go, we're driving to the gig, he's telling me about Seinfeld, he finds out I'm  a comedian, he starts calling me Jerry.  Oh, jeez.  Oof.  I took him out to, we went to lunch, you know, because we had like an hour to kill.  Yeah.  So, the whole time he's telling me about, you know, his family and he's, you know, he's  like Jerry and I'm like Bob.  He's like, oh, I know, but I just really like Jerry.  So, I'm like, okay, call me Jerry. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, my God, that's weird.  So, then I go to do this gig.  It's outside, after a band, in the rain, in the afternoon, next to a skydiving simulator,  at a beer fest.  So, how was the gig?  It was all right.  It wasn't that bad.  You pulled it off.  So, this gig was hell.  So, I go back to New York.  I met this guy.  I mean, I lived this Seinfeld episode.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  I can't wait to see Jerry and tell him the gig, you know, tell him about the gig.  So, the first time we talked, we made a bet.  I was making bets and he jumped in on the bet.  So, I owed him a buck because he won the bet.  That's why, that was our conversation.  Oh, okay.  So, he's on stage.  Do you remember what the bet was?  Yeah, it was if Gretzky was on the team that, when the Rangers won the Stanley Cup.  And, no, he wasn't.  All right.  And, so, he walks off stage and I got my dollar out and there's like a crowd of people going nuts. 
[01:25:00]  He walks by me at the foot of the stairs in the cellar and I go, here's your buck.  You won the bet.  And, he looks at me with like, I almost think that, you know, he could smell dog shit, but he doesn't know where it is.  Look.  And, he took the buck, which kind of annoyed me that he took the buck.  Of course.  And, he didn't say nuts.  All right, don't worry about it.  He took it.  Yeah.  I go, but I got a story for you first.  He goes, you want your buck back? 
[01:25:30]  So, in my head, I'm like, what a fucking dick.  And, he walks up two stairs.  He turns around and he goes, I'll be upstairs in the back corner eating.  So, when you're done, come up and we'll talk upstairs.  So, I go, all right, man.  I'll be up.  I'm doing my set.  Right after my set, I'll come up.  We'll sit.  We'll talk.  He goes, not you. 
[01:26:00]  He was talking to the lady next to me.  I was so...  You understand, there was a crowd of people there.  The lady next to me looked at me like, I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  And, then he just walked up the stairs.  How embarrassing.  Oh, for that split second, you're like, oh, my God.  Jerry's inviting me up to his table.  I'm going to hang.  And, then, not you.  I said it so confident, dude.  I was like, dude, I've got to do my set. 
[01:26:30]  But, right when I'm done with my set, I'll be up and I'll join you.  And, then, we'll talk about stories.  I've got to do my craft.  Not you.  And, that Jew voice.  That, his just big, fat lips.  Just not you.  Opie and Anthony are back.  On with the fart jokes.  On SiriusXM.  I'm long enough to say 
[01:27:00]  Someone has taken my place  When time go bad  When time go rough  Won't you lay me down in the tall grass  And lift me my stuff  Why are we playing this?  Nick Fleetwood is 67 today.  Oh.  More importantly, Al Molinano.  Molinaro.  Al Molinaro. 
[01:27:30]  Huh?  From Happy Days?  95 today.  What?  Al Molinaro.  Wow, he's still alive.  Big Al is still alive.  Big Al.  Al Delvecchio.  That's right.  Wow.  95.  95.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Very good.  That's my impression.  I like it.  We all remember him as  Murray the Cop  From the Odd Couple.  Well, not all of us remember him as that. 
[01:28:00]  But, if you're a child of the 80s,  You do remember.  Well, perhaps.  Odd Couple was one of those shows.  Big show in the 80s.  Child of the 80s stuff.  Hey, we got an update on the KFC girl.  Oh, yeah.  We had so much fun with this last week.  You're laughing at Sam.  Well, what's wrong, Sam?  Just the original run of the Odd Couple.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, 70 to 75.  Yeah, but it was reruns. 
[01:28:30]  What's a rerun?  Oh, very good.  That black guy who has a great dancer.  We watched it in rerun.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  So, the little girl that we talked about last week.  And had a lot of fun with.  Oh, the poor girl.  You know, the one that got kicked out of KFC  Because, you know, she was disturbing other customers.  Yeah, someone in KFC said she was scaring the other customers  Because her face was disfigured from being attacked  By a pit bull.  By three pit bulls that her grandfather owned. 
[01:29:00]  I know hindsight's trying to...  Didn't that not sound right when it happened?  Like...  There was too much fun, though.  It sounded...  Oh, man.  I believed it, but I was like,  Something didn't sound right about it, even though I did...  Well, the interview with the grandma, I think,  With the pit bulls still barking in the background,  It seems like they didn't even get rid of the dogs  That caused this horrific thing.  I believe they were euthanized,  But they probably got new dogs.  Maybe.  Or they had more dogs than the ones that were involved in the attack.  How about if that happens to your granddaughter?  You euthanize everything. 
[01:29:30]  I don't think the little girl wants to hear,  A dog barking any time soon.  No, no.  The injuries were horrific.  Poor kid.  So they supposedly told her to leave,  And that caused a major outrage,  And she got all sorts of money and things.  KFC said they were going to donate $30,000 to her medical...  But that was just a start.  Yeah, that was just a start.  For a scheme asking.  Because then they had an online...  And everyone just donated.  A lot of people were very generous.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they felt really sorry for her. 
[01:30:00]  And what happened with the KFC thing, especially.  Raised over $100,000.  Right.  Well, it's a hoax.  Oh, boy.  There's still...  Not the fact that she was attacked.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  That's even a lie.  She's showing off.  It's a hoax.  Yuck.  Really?  Oh, yuck.  No.  Not even...  No, no, no.  Dump tits. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, my God.  Maybe people walk by our studio.  Yeah.  That's all we can tell you at this point.  Oh, my God.  So, they're still reportedly a huge hoax.  But it was a huge hoax.  The KFC...  Yeah.  This grandma, I think she...  She looks exactly like the type of white trash you see on Cops.  Sure.  Outside a trailer yelling that her husband hit her. 
[01:31:00]  Hoax that never happened.  Apparently, the entire incident in the restaurant was cooked up as an elaborate publicity stunt  to raise money.  A lot of this shit's going on these days, man.  Mm-hmm.  After the KFC franchise, where the incident allegedly took place, became suspicious of  the timeline presented by Victoria's family, they hired an independent investigator who  has yet to release their final report.  Oh, boy.  But a source tells the Laurel Leader call that the story completely falls apart upon basic 
[01:31:30]  fact-checking.  Security footage does not put Victoria or her grandmother, who claimed to be with her, in  the KFC.  Or even another KFC.  Oh, boy.  The day the incident supposedly occurred.  And apparently, no one made their order for mashed potatoes and sweet tea that day either.  Mm-hmm.  No one even ordered mashed potatoes and sweet tea as part of a larger order.  The family had been raising money on GoFundMe for Victoria's medical bills. 
[01:32:00]  And as the Clarion Ledger reports, their widely reported story gave a serious boost to donations.  It certainly did.  More than $135,000 has been raised through the online donation site.  Wow.  Now, let me tell you something.  Since June 13th.  If that stupid grandmother was trying to bilk people out of money, then she should be fucking  executed.  But if this money is being used for the poor little kid, you've got to almost look at the  end justifies the means kind of a thing. 
[01:32:30]  If there's this desperation going on that this kid needs surgeries and just there's no recourse,  no money, then it's almost a commendable thing.  But I don't trust this old bitch as far as I can throw her bag of bones.  But who's the asshole that asked for their money back?  Right.  Yeah.  I gave $10,000, but, you know, you lied about the KFC incident, so I need my money back.  Right.  As that kid is still suffering somewhere.  Does she look really bad?  I remember saying.  It was brutal, man.  You know what? 
[01:33:00]  There was a lot of scars.  She lost an arm, right?  She, uh, what the hell?  There was a whole list of things.  She was very cute, but you could tell, like, oh, boy, she's very scarred up now.  I don't know what kind of, you know, as time goes by or what kind of, um,  uh, corrective, uh, surgery they could do to her face.  But, you know, I'm sure the money will help.  Yeah.  Fucking ass.  Pitbulls can be real dicks.  Any dogs can be, but pitbulls can be real dicks.  Jimmy, they're the most misunderstood breed.  Oh, I didn't mean to say that.  I want to apologize to all pitbulls and pitbull owners. 
[01:33:30]  Dan Soder talking about the, when, when the pitbull is on the sixth death shake.  Right.  The sixth death shake.  We got, uh, a lot of pitbull owners that get mad whenever you talk about how vicious they are.  But the fact of the matter is, um, most of the time when you get a, a, an attack from a dog that is very serious,  it's usually a Roddy or a pitbull.  Now, people will be like, you know, the, the dog that attacks the most is a chihuahua. 
[01:34:00]  Shut the fuck up.  What's that little piece of shit going to do?  You'll fling him across the room.  Yeah, how many women have said that when I took my dick out?  You know, what are you going to do?  Bill Burr says his pitbull's nice.  You know, there are some great, nice pitbulls, I bet.  But to tell you the truth, if you have three pitbulls, uh, that, that are, uh, uh, cohorting with each other, 
[01:34:30]  and you, you put a little kid into the mix, you're a fucking idiot.  And, and you should, uh, be arrested for a child endangerment.  So the fund before the KFC incident only got $595.  So then, you know, this smart grandma came up with this scheme, like, well, fuck, I know how we could get the money up.  That's kind of smart on her part.  Again, if it's for the kid, that's brilliant.  If it's for her fucking, you know, to, uh, to line her pocket, to line her pocket, to buy some more menthol cigarettes. 
[01:35:00]  She turned the $595 into $135,000.  Righteous.  Yeah.  Uh, let's see, according to Bill Kellum, the lawyer representing Kelly Mullins, Victoria's grandmother,  the family has not yet decided whether or not to take the money from KFC,  but apparently KFC will honor the donation, even if the incident is proven to be fake.  They come out looking great in this, because they, um, were initially the villains in this. 
[01:35:30]  They, they donate money, and then find out it was a hoax, and then they still give the money.  That's great PR for them.  Right.  I do like their potatoes and gravy.  I'll tell you that much.  I haven't had KFC chicken in so long.  KFC chicken is so good.  Holy fuck, is it good?  Right?  Is it a bucket of chicken smells so good?  God.  Mmm.  Wow.  So, the, somebody from KFC posted on a website, they have pledged the money, even if it's 
[01:36:00]  proven that the incident never happened.  At this point, their story is full of holes.  Any thinking person who follows their timeline can see it.  The event at KFC never happened.  Yeah.  So they're a little pissed.  They, they, they have to offer the money no matter what.  Yeah.  You know they don't want to, because they'll probably hate the grandmother, but.  Yeah, well as long as they make, uh, sure it's going to the, uh, kid.  Right.  You know, I, I, I, I'd like to see if any of the money that was being given has been spent 
[01:36:30]  as of yet, and what it's been spent on.  Yeah, it was like, let's see what this grandma has been, uh, spending money on.  You know, if she's buying a fucking Jag, uh, it's a problem.  New Jaguar, yeah.  That's a problem.  Well, we got the people with their comments.  Let's say hi to Frank in Missouri.  Frank.  Hey fellas, why do these people, why do these people need to pass the hat?  They've got Obamacare to pay all this kid's medical bills.  Well, that's sure.  What's the cosmetic stuff?  You know, you don't want a little girl to be scarred, I guess. 
[01:37:00]  I'm sure there's no fucking, it's not covered.  No, let's cover that and cover a sex change.  Maybe they can make her face look like a current.  Oh, Jesus, you fucking, like a what?  A cunt.  She's brutal.  What the fuck?  Jesus Christ.  Well, you know, can they do that?  I mean, this is a logical question for others.  I don't think plastic surgery is covered.  No?  Even for a little girl that was attacked by a pit bull?  Yes.  I don't think it's covered.  Honestly, I think that's cosmetic. 
[01:37:30]  A blonde little girl with blue eyes?  I think any of the surgeries that helps her eat better, breathe better, things like that,  that would save her life or make her life easier physically is covered.  But as far as just, you know, hey, we've got to make her look better, I don't think that shit's covered.  I think you need the donations.  Let's go to Bobby in Kentucky.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Hey, fellas.  Hey, that bit on, I'm sorry, but Dan Soter and Ant and Opie, you guys were ranting about 
[01:38:00]  that.  Dan had a line that had me laughing all fucking day.  He said, maybe the dog was trying to give the girl sweet orbital bone crushing kisses.  I would not stop laughing.  That's hilarious.  Well, it's going to be on our podcast tomorrow, by the way.  Terrible.  Every Wednesday, it's Opie and Anthony podcast day, and that's going to be on the podcast 
[01:38:30]  tomorrow.  So thank you, Bobby.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Let's say hi to Devin in Wisconsin.  Devin.  Hey.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hi, Devin.  Hey.  You know, as a pit bull owner my whole life, I'm not going to be the typical person to just  come out and say that you guys are bashing the breed.  But I will tell you that a lot of the problems with the breed has to do with inbreeding of  the same bloodlines of these dogs.  Of the owners?  That happens.  Yes.  Well, yeah, pretty much that, too. 
[01:39:00]  But, you know, I've had a pit bull.  She's 14 years old now.  She was my son's first birthday present, you know, and never had a problem with her.  Most docile dog.  But you've just got to stay away from the people, the inner city people who inbreed  these things and turn them into fighting dogs.  Well, there is this want for these dogs to be aggressive in some cultures.  They do love a good, vicious fucking pit bull around the house.  And I think those are a huge problem. 
[01:39:30]  And, you know, some of these white trash assholes, too.  That's for sure.  Look up trunking on you.  I'm busy.  Trunking?  Trunking?  Trunking?  Yeah, so whenever you call yourself Eddie and you say classic metal.  Bon Jovi fans since day one.  These guys down in Milwaukee and Chicago, they'll take two dogs and they put them in  the trunk of a car.  And they shut the trunk up real loud.  I don't think that's true, though. 
[01:40:00]  Well, I don't know.  I heard about this.  Although, I wouldn't put anything past anyone.  I saw a fucking picture yesterday that was sickening.  It was in some African nation, I gather.  And it was a bunch of Africans.  And they had a cat nailed to a cross.  And they were walking around with it as some symbolic Christianity bullshit.  But, of course, taken in some uncivilized extent, extreme. 
[01:40:30]  And it was just an important cat nailed to it.  Why would the cat volunteer to do that?  See, the cat, much like Jesus, didn't volunteer for it.  I didn't realize that.  Forgive them, Father.  No, not what they do.  What's the purpose of that, though?  Do we know what the purpose of that is?  I don't know.  I'm sure it's some kind of, you know.  Is it part of their culture or is it just a bunch of assholes?  Was there a little sign over the cat that said, I cover my duty? 
[01:41:00]  No, it's awful.  He was nailed to the cross through his little paws.  And then his midsection was, like, tied, I guess because he was hanging too much.  And he looked like he was dead.  I, you know, it's so fucking infuriating.  It's had to be dead at that point, no.  So I wouldn't put anything past anyone as far as what people will do to animals.  All right, let's go to Jake in Philly.  Jake!  Yeah, listen, fuck that last faggot caller talking about his nice little pit bull. 
[01:41:30]  My neighbor was the same exact way.  When I was a little kid, we had this neighbor that had a fucking pit bull.  In 93, it was a really bad snowstorm.  So I wore one of those face cover masks that, like, robbers wear, the typical robbers wear.  It was just your eyes and mouth.  The one when you're a kid, it cakes up with snot under the nose hole?  It was delicious, yeah.  Disgusting.  I'm outside playing in the snow.  Those things went away.  It just doesn't get cold enough anymore in the Northeast. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, I think so.  Goes good with a hoodie.  Plus different black, exactly.  Oh, Jesus.  I didn't say that.  Back to the story.  So this fucking dog runs out of my neighbor's yard, see me with this mask, lunges at my face, bit my face.  I had to get 12 stitches in my lip.  He ripped my fucking lip off.  Jeez.  I'm 30 years old.  I still have scarves.  Does it look bad?  It looks, well, frankly enough, I was so young. 
[01:42:30]  I won't bore you guys.  Long story short, he bit.  Too late.  You want to get bit in the face?  That's where you want to get bit.  A lot of it grew back because I was so young.  Yeah.  Oh.  What do you do?  I doubt you ever want to be bit in the face.  Yeah, exactly.  No matter how young you are.  No.  And imagine just going to school.  Wouldn't the ass be the best place?  That's the back of the leg.  A lot of meat back there.  Yeah, the dick.  No.  But imagine going to school in fifth grade, you're a kid, you're getting your balls busted. 
[01:43:00]  This wound was three months.  It took three months to heal.  I couldn't go out in the sun.  Well, it's nothing compared to what this poor girl's got going for her.  You see her face and her little eye patch?  She doesn't have an eyeball.  It's terrible.  I was just playing with the dog.  Bit my face off.  Mr. Maloney came through.  Terrible.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks.  Hang in there.  Yeah, these pit bull owners sometimes, and I do understand, there's sort of a thing to, 
[01:43:30]  you know, kick these dogs around and make them vicious, but I think there is some type  of something innate in their DNA that might have a propensity toward biting, and they're  a big dog to be biting.  Land alligator was out there.  That was funny, yeah.  Land alligator.  Let's go to Peter in Texas.  Peter.  Pumpkin eater. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, he had a wife and used to put his, what, did he beat her or not beat her?  I don't remember.  I couldn't remember that goddamn rhyme.  I would always sing it loud.  My mother would go, Chip, I'll be quiet.  Of course she would.  Sensible woman.  Yeah, it's two o'clock in the morning.  I was all sugared up.  Hey, guys.  I wanted to tell you about the Tommy Smythe video from ESPN.  He was discussing this Italian player from the World Cup.  And he was explaining that he wasn't doing well because he doesn't have enough jizz. 
[01:44:30]  Jizz?  Really?  Yeah, it's on YouTube and everywhere.  You just look it up.  It's S-M-Y-T-H.  Is there another meaning for the word jizz?  He just doesn't have enough.  I have no idea.  All right, hold on.  Here it is.  It's on a goal in the 44th minute by the captain, Brian Ruiz.  Certainly leading by example, getting the only goal of the game.  And one of the things we talked about, Tommy, in the first half of plays, we see Italy getting  ready to bring on Cassano, is Pirlo was not as involved. 
[01:45:00]  He got involved late in the first half.  How about this?  36 touches in the first half.  He had double.  72 in the first half versus England.  Yeah, and it was very noticeable.  I mean, you could see it without even counting passes.  You could notice that he just didn't have that little bit of jizz in him today.  A little bit of what?  Jizz.  Oh, okay.  Thiago Monta is going to be coming out.  A few minutes later. 
[01:45:30]  Corner kick, Costa Rica.  And just in case you're wondering, an iron jizz means you have no step on you.  You have no little bit of get up and go.  Yeah, I knew that.  Yeah, it seemed to have confused.  No, I had no idea.  It confused a lot of people.  I just wanted them to.  I had no idea.  Okay.  Corner.  To the right of Buffon.  All right.  That's pretty good.  A little bit of get up and go on your back.  Yeah, exactly.  Your breath smells like get up and go. 
[01:46:00]  Hey, you get up and go bucket.  Why does your mother like black eyes to get up and go on her face?  Wow, I didn't know that.  Good find, Peter.  Thank you.  He's got no jizz in him.  Thanks, guys.  Have a great day.  Soccer doing very well.  U.S. Portugal.  Total of 25 million people tuned in in America to watch that game.  Yeah.  25 million people were watching Sunday.  Yeah, boy.  And they fucking blew it.  Yeah.  And they blew it. 
[01:46:30]  That's a big fucking number.  Well, they still have a chance against Germany.  I think they got much of a chance.  I don't know.  Those chairmen.  Yeah, they're not good at soccer because of the way they march.  Yeah, they just keep the stick.  Kick the ball.  The straight line.  Yeah, they kick the ball really far where it goes under the leg a lot.  And then they try to hit it with their head and it gets caught on that spiky helmet.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  But they're really mean in Germany, too.  They call the soccer ball the Jew.  And that's just inappropriate.  That is not nice at all.  Kick the Jew. 
[01:47:00]  Why do I have to do that?  We got it.  We get it, Jim.  Yeah.  Rotten Germans.  Well, break time.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we got to get ready for Melissa McCarthy.  Jesus Christ.  I got a good question for her.  Do you?  So how long have you been an actress?  If he says this, I'm just leaving the room.  You'll hear that door squeak open and close like stand-alone fruit.  And who's Ben Falcone?  That's right. 
[01:47:30]  He was in the movie and he wrote and directed it.  He's coming in, too.  The brother of a famous DJ.  No?  Yeah, Denny.  Denny's disappointed me.  Why?  He's not doing your party?  He's not doing my party.  Why isn't he doing your party?  I thought it was the fourth.  I said it was the fifth for a long time.  And for the love of God, he says, I got a wedding to do.  He's got a wedding.  Bad career move.  But doesn't that just show you? 
[01:48:00]  No offense, Denny.  But your idiocy is monumental.  There would be stories and they would talk about your business.  Yeah, this would be legendary.  What can I do?  I got a wedding.  No, he's going to do a wedding.  I got a wedding.  What can I do?  No, we'll do a wedding and no one will talk about it.  No.  You know, I'm going to have to depend on it.  I'm going to have to have a bride.  Yeah.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Fucking yuck.  You have to depend on the Sonos system.  Who get another DJ?  Yeah.  Really show it to Denny? 
[01:48:30]  I don't want a DJ.  Give him a little bit of his face.  I want a Denny Falcone there.  Have a look at it.  What?  All right.  You ever seen my house?  That's a good point.  I'll do it.  There's three black people allowed at my house.  Yeah.  The one would be Carlton.  Mm-hmm.  And the other two are strategically placed around my yard.  Jesus.  Jesus.  It's not a very open policy.  It's not an open-minded of you.  No.  It's not. 
[01:49:00]  Who kid's not allowed in your house?  No.  Who kid's been over?  He was a pisser.  He brought a friend.  He was watching all of us sing karaoke.  Oh, that's right.  White people are crazy.  He had a fun time.  Is this what white people do?  It was like he was on some kind of an expedition.  Yeah.  Watching what crazy white people do in their native habitat.  Are you going, Sam?  I think so.  Yeah.  I don't think you're busy.  I don't find anywhere else.  It's going to be a good one.  Sounds like he's got things to do.  Got the same caterer coming.  Mm-hmm.  Does some good job. 
[01:49:30]  I think even Roland appreciated the food at the last outing.  Got to put the big tent up, which is always good.  And the pool is fucking ready to rock.  So.  I got one of those bathing suits that wraps around the one leg.  Do you have that one half-a-thon for the guy who grabs your ball bag and your dick  and then, whoop, swings around?  I got one for the summer, so.  Yeah.  I'll wear that.  Good for you.  That's great, man. 
[01:50:00]  Good boy.  Is Lady Di coming to the party?  Nope.  She's been asking about it.  She will never come to my house.  Colin thinks Colin is going to get her a car and she's going.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  She's going to have a hard time getting in then.  You don't have any say in this.  If Colin says Lady Di's coming to the party, she's coming to the party.  I mean, Colin has a plus one, right?  That would be great.  Technicality.  She's probably two.  So. 
[01:50:30]  You coming, Roland?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  You always have delicious food.  Yeah.  The best, though.  I mean, you always have the tough quality.  It's the same guy that used to come over at K-Rock and cook us the breakfasts.  The steak and eggs and stuff.  What's your shirt say?  Team Harvey.  What's that?  Suits.  What is that thing you're wearing?  It's like.  It's from Mr. DJ Who Kid.  Is it nunchucks?  Yeah.  It's like a little Bruce Lee decked out in golden diamonds.  It's a gold gave you bling? 
[01:51:00]  He gave me bling.  He said, this is it.  You can walk around and use the n-word.  So I was like.  Okay.  That's like.  Yeah.  You have to snap your fingers first before you say it.  Like it's a waiter.  That was pretty cool.  Roland decided we had A-list guests in today, like Joel McHale and Melissa McCarthy.  Uh-huh.  So he decided to wear a suits t-shirt and a necklace with a gold-encrusted Bruce Lee Lego  figure on it.  Let's bruce it up a bit.  It is a gold-encrusted Lego.  Okay.  With a nunchuck. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Joel wants one, so Hook is going to send him one, too.  Oh, yeah.  Any high-fives in the subway for the team?  Soccer is, they're very dangerous hooligans.  Hooligans, huh?  So I do not wear any soccer jerseys.  You're not going with the soccer jerseys for high-fives on the subway.  What's wrong with you?  Not if you're wearing a USA one.  No, I don't know, though, because they're very passionate.  USA would be huge.  Yeah.  People are very passionate.  But you're not getting high-fives for your suits t-shirt.  No, people are just very confused.  Like we are.  I don't know the first thing about suits.  It's the best show ever. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, all right.  You could really, like, fit into a group right now just by wearing a certain jersey.  Soccer jersey.  Yeah, if you wear something like a Puerto Rico or fucking Dominican Republic or something  like that, you'd fit in better.  Or an Italian one.  You go there, and then Italians are fucking talking to you.  USA, God knows what this country's made up of anymore, so that would be kind of a crapshoot.  Yeah, Portugal's huge.  Portugal?  Portugal, right.  Portugal.  I would have worn an Italian one. 
[01:52:30]  They're out of it, though, right?  Yeah.  Italy?  Italy.  Portugal's in.  Team Messi.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What about China?  Do they have a team?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  I can't imagine they do, right?  I would guess.  They don't seem like the soccer type.  Why?  They're low to the ground.  They're probably great at it.  They're, like, actual-sized little foosball players.  Oh, I see.  The foosball.  Melissa McCarthy next?  Mom said, I can't play the foosball no more.  Yeah, she ran a little bit behind, so I'll check.  With her husband, Ben Falcone? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, Mr. Falcone.  Did you see the movie, Tammy?  Benny Falcone.  I did.  And?  It was funny.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Nice.  It looks funny.  I didn't see it.  But I read reactions.  Oh, boy.  I just read yours.  I went with Spencer.  We both enjoyed it.  It was funny.  Spencer.  What did you like about it?  It was, like, the buddy duo comedies.  My buddy.  What was it about?  Did anyone say we're getting too old for this shit? 
[01:53:30]  No.  Did they jump in a car and go, whoa, and then hit the ground?  I was very hot, and I was tired, so.  How long did you sleep during this movie?  That's a good sign, if it's a good one or a bad one.  Even the good ones, by the way, he sleeps part of the movie.  So, who's ever hot in a movie theater?  How many minutes did you sleep?  The air condition down, like, a meat freezer.  This one was an hour and a half movie.  Huh?  This is an hour and a half movie.  Hour and a half?  Yeah.  I like that.  Me too. 
[01:54:00]  How long did you sleep?  An hour and 20.  You slept most of the movie?  Yeah.  But the beginning's really good, though.  Oh, my God.  That was the hesitation in the beginning.  I was sweating a lot, and then the air condition kicked in.  It happens.  It's always on.  You can't be a big-time booker and then say on the radio that you slept for an hour and  20 minutes out of an hour and a half.  Yeah.  It's a fat person, like a beer coma. 
[01:54:30]  Oh.  Did you have a lot of food before the movie?  No, no.  I didn't eat.  No.  I just had a cup of water, and then I took, like, an allergy pill.  Oh, that'll make you drowsy, right?  So I was, like, seeing down.  I go, okay, it's getting good, getting good.  And I woke up.  I'm like, oh, what's going on?  I'm like, oh, no.  I could take a Sudafed.  It's like I took, like, drugs.  Like, I took illegal drugs.  But it was funny what I saw.  Two thumbs up.  You're not supposed to take illegal drugs.  No, but it's like...  How would you know if it's like that?  I would imagine.  Oh. 
[01:55:00]  I took a clear chance.  I would imagine that being that buzzy and kind of, whoa, is pretty much how it would  probably be.  Same thing.  To take illegal drugs.  Sam was just texting me about what a disturbance.  Yeah.  How about what a disturbance Roland was in the last movie that they went to see together?  Oh, a lot of snoring.  A lot of snoring.  Yeah.  What movie?  It was a gay porno.  No, the Laurence Fishburne movie.  Oh, yeah.  Another snooze fest.  Jeez. 
[01:55:30]  They're all snooze fests for him.  That's an exciting one.  My body protects me.  Your body protects you?  Sounds like a bad movie.  He's slept through the entire movie.  The best is when he starts falling asleep and he starts falling into the aisle, but  somehow he doesn't fall all the way.  That's what...  It's amazing that you could sleep like that.  That's how I woke up.  Someone whacked a leg against my head.  They were getting back to their sleep.  That's the only way you could tell he's falling asleep in the 3D IMAX, because he's got the  glasses on.  So then he falls asleep and then you just see his head going a way that heads aren't supposed 
[01:56:00]  to turn and twist.  Colin Quinn, everybody.  Ah!  What's up, Kyle?  Oh, guys.  Thanks for taking my call.  Oh, this is from yesterday.  No, no.  I even explained to Jimmy.  We didn't...  I give a shit.  Okay.  I give a shit.  Hey, what's up?  We were like saying goodbye and they finally...  As we were pushing the button, it said Colin Quinn.  Timing issue.  Like the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the warning coming in.  So sorry about that from yesterday.  You guys are going to be saying goodbye to every fucking comedian when I just waved my 
[01:56:30]  hand.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Geez.  What the hell?  You got that kind of pull?  I got that kind of juice.  All I'm saying is that it's all going to be worth it when that fucking car service  pulls up.  If that lady dies, shows up at my house, that car service is turning right around and I'm  sending her wherever the fuck you are, Kyle.  She's not coming to my party.  Kyle says she is.  Break up my party.  If she says that it's all called back to the DJ, well, maybe she could fill in. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, she'd fill in my pool.  All monkeys all the time.  All monkeys all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  I, I, I, I, she, I've, I've had Bobo at my parties and, and I'm sure she would be more  annoying to my friends and family than even Bobo.  All right.  As long as we've clarified that.  Yeah.  What about you, Kyle? 
[01:57:30]  Where will you be on the field?  I'll be in Philly.  I'll be in Philly.  Oh, damn it.  The next couple of weeks.  I have to pee.  I'll bring it back.  All right.  Oh, geez.  We have to.  I have to piss.  Oh.  Okay.  Go ahead.  I'll talk to Kyle.  Don't go.  Oh, okay.  What?  Everyone left me.  They all left me.  Fucking faggots.  They all left me.  Yeah.  Well, now that they're gone.  Yeah.  Now that they're gone.  Mm-hmm.  Those two are cramping your fucking style and bringing you down so hard.  Thanks, Kyle. 
[01:58:00]  Everybody knows it except for you.  It's cramping my style.  It's you, baby.  That's what I hear.  I don't know, though.  What am I going to do?  Kyle, you're going to be in Philly, huh?  Yeah.  God damn it.  It's going to be a big soiree.  I know.  I'd like to come to the Big Bash.  It's going to be quite an event, isn't it?  Yes, it is.  I'm sure it'll be at the end of summer party.  We've got summer solstice party at some point.  I got a little preview from the Nassau County Police Department Saturday. 
[01:58:30]  Oh.  They showed up at 8 a.m. on Saturday morning because that party was going from Friday into  Saturday, and apparently the music was very loud for many hours.  Yeah.  Well.  Hello.  Hello?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh.  Who was that?  Well, you guys called me.  I don't know.  Diana, I got bad news.  What?  Colin, what? 
[01:59:00]  The party.  There's a kibosh on the party, apparently.  The what?  No.  There's no party.  The party's in.  I mean, you're not invited.  I'm not invited.  We're both out.  Oh, that's a shame.  And if you get a full test list, there'll be another summer solstice at the end of the  year, I bet.  I'm thinking, yeah, Labor Day, there's usually a big Labor Day party.  But again, Lady Di.  We had a nice culottes.  We had out there.  What?  We had a nice culottes.  Lady Di, you can't come to my house. 
[01:59:30]  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  What?  All right.  I can't come to your house.  But if you ever invite me to your house, me and or Marius to your house, we would definitely  behave ourselves.  It's impossible for you to behave yourself.  It's impossible for you to behave yourself.  It's not within your person to behave yourself.  What are you talking about?  And then you have accidents.  You think I want you having an accident in my pool like a child at a water park?  No.  I have to close it off and shock the pool. 
[02:00:00]  He's holding that one incident against you.  One incident.  She craps herself.  She pukes.  She pisses.  I don't do that anymore.  That was a virus.  Oh, it was a virus.  That's what I want.  A virus in my pool.  That's what I want.  No, you don't have a virus.  You're not going to have a virus.  If you go in my pool and take a dump in there or puke, there will be a virus.  I will have to clear the pool out.  It will ruin the party.  Lady Di is just trying to be funny for the show. 
[02:00:30]  No.  Yeah.  I'm not.  And then she'll be going up to members of my family, my Uncle Tony.  Hi, you're Uncle Tony.  Hi.  I'm Lady Di.  Oh, come on.  Who gives a shit?  He'd be like, who gives a shit?  Lady Di.  But what I'm trying to tell you is that we would behave if we were ever.  You can't behave.  You ever hear the story?  Yes, I can.  You ever hear the story of the scorpion that needed to go across the lake? 
[02:01:00]  And it was going to ride on the frog's back?  Yes.  You ever hear the story of the scorpion that ran into Ugly Betty in the bathroom?  Yes.  There's a scorpion and he needs a ride across the river.  Where's he going?  And into the frog to the other side.  Then why does he take a boat?  He doesn't have a boat.  He's going to ride on the frog's back.  And the frog goes, no way, you're a scorpion.  You'll sting me.  And he goes, look, I'm not going to sting you.  Oh, is this the one where he goes, you knew I was a scorpion?  Yes.  Oh, can I tell the story?  Well, Lady Di is a big, fat, disgusting scorpion. 
[02:01:30]  A whale needed to ride across the lake.  And the frog said, why'd you shit on me?  And she said, you knew I was an alcoholic.  I got on your back.  I love that story.  I would definitely not misbehave.  You can't.  Do you understand?  And anyway, I'd be hanging out with Colin a lot.  Both of us were invited.  Oh, yeah.  Colin would love that.  A nice pair of culottes.  He wants her to wear culottes.  It's 1976. 
[02:02:00]  The bicentennial.  Yeah.  I didn't say anything about wearing a culottes.  Oh, she doesn't know what she's even talking about.  Booty shorts are in the middle, guys.  No, you know, you have conversations on a tape delay.  Yes.  It's always three seconds late, and then you just blather on.  I would have anyone else over my house before I would have Lady Di over my house.  That's how despicable and embarrassing she is.  I think people want to see her at your party, though. 
[02:02:30]  No.  No.  Opie, you're gone, right?  No.  Why?  Yes, yes, Colin.  I've got my own thing going on.  Wow.  That is exciting, but I've got my own thing going on.  Excuse me.  Yes, Colin.  What?  Where's Lady Di?  Where's Opie?  Right here.  I had to take a leak.  I'm back.  Opie's speaking, and she goes, where's Opie?  She asks Opie, where's Opie?  I'll be back two minutes.  Opie.  Yeah.  Opie.  Okay.  He swore that her and Mary would not act up. 
[02:03:00]  You've got to have them at your house.  They're incapable of not acting.  They can't not act up.  You've got to have them at your house.  No.  She'll be fine.  She gets a few in her, and then she just starts mouthing off to my family and friends.  How embarrassing would that be?  You've got to have Mary and the tough guy at your house.  Like Fredo's girl at the wedding.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  Could you take care of them?  Yeah, you take care of it, Mike.  Never be a fan of a WAP. 
[02:03:30]  What, Lady Di?  The only one I know from your family is your brother, Joe.  Oh, yeah.  Joe's asking for you.  Wow, you interrupted everything for that.  Right, for that.  So glad we all know that now.  Yeah, but Lady Di.  We all now know that you've met Brother Joe.  And I also know your cat.  I see him all the time.  If you were there, a Beavis.  Once again, interrupting everything to tell the world that you know Anthony's cat.  Little Beav.  If you were there, though, you would start yapping to all my friends and family, and they'd 
[02:04:00]  be like, who is this disaster?  I think people would like to see them at your house.  Ah, well.  You're very good with animals.  That's for sure.  What?  Of course you are.  How about when Anthony decides, you know, after a couple, he decides it's starting to get  to be Twilight, he decides to take you upstairs.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  That's a bad idea.  The only way I'd take her upstairs is to reenact that scene from The Omen.  What, where she jumps off from the entire balcony and comes with her?  I did it for you, Anthony. 
[02:04:30]  Unless she's laying with a broken fucking femur on the bottom of the thing in the top  of the house.  But she didn't spill her drink.  What?  I mean, it's your, it's your house.  Yeah.  I can't tell you what to do.  Thanks for telling me.  Oh, okay.  But the whole thing is, I mean, if you did invite me and Marion, even Bobo, we would behave  ourselves.  Yeah, absolutely.  I say yes.  Bobo's been there twice, actually.  Yeah, Bobo has been there a couple times.  Bobo has been to two of my parties.  I have, you know.  Lady Di, if you go to Anthony's house, you know, what could he expect? 
[02:05:00]  Walk us through this.  Oh, God.  Um, he would expect me to lounge around in a lounge chair.  Okay.  Oh, great.  That means, let me get my welder over to reinforce those.  And that means pass out, by the way.  That's not, that's not lounging.  That's, she'll pass out in a lounge chair.  No, no.  Um, having a few drinks.  And shitting in my pool.  Would you sit in Anthony's pool or his hot tub?  And if I feel like it, I would go for a swim. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, God.  Ooh.  I wouldn't even get in that pool.  Would you be mad to see shit in your jacuzzi?  Oh, my God.  And wreck the party?  Oh, the water coming.  I have a little waterfall that goes from the jacuzzi into the fucking pool.  It would look like all the mud coming out when, when, when Newman tried to steal that shit from the Jurassic Park.  And the mud covered it up.  That's what it would look like coming out.  Diarrhea.  Hey, die.  I'm never, I'm never going to live that down, am I what?  No. 
[02:06:00]  Would you, uh, not.  Would you, would you go skinny dipping?  Um, uh, uh, let's see.  Yes, you would.  Only, only, only if, only if everybody else would.  Oh, God.  Good answer.  Good answer.  And I really doubt that.  The, the, the, the name in itself is, makes it impossible for you to do it.  I can skinny dip if I want to.  No, you can't.  You could fat dip.  You fat dip. 
[02:06:30]  You old cheese dip.  Hold on, hold on.  You onion dip.  You could pig dip.  Yeah.  What, you fucking did?  What, oh, why?  I love this abusive relationship here.  Wait, what is Bill saying?  Oh, please smack her.  No, nothing.  I asked him if he, if he put the 12 pack in the refrigerator.  Of course.  Jesus Christ.  You guys have really, you guys have really, you guys have really political conversations.  Yes.  Yeah.  Tell him to shut up, Ty.  What?  Tell him to shut up. 
[02:07:00]  I don't know.  I don't have to tell him to shut up.  Did you?  Did you put the 12 pack in?  Huh?  He put it in.  Okay, great.  How many, how many Natty Ices today?  Oh, oh, gee, I knew you were going to ask that.  Oh, boy.  Did you?  Wow.  You're sharp.  Sharp as a tack.  That's it, huh?  Yeah, that's it for now.  Yeah.  Second one.  Slowing down.  9 a.m.  You know, it's only nine on a Tuesday.  Why not?  I have two for Tuesday. 
[02:07:30]  Two for Tuesday.  There you go.  Have a two for.  Oh, lady, die.  I would never have you over my house.  What if Colin brings her, though?  Is Colin going to the party?  Colin can.  He's going to be in Philly.  In Philly.  If he has one of those late August or, you know, a light in August or maybe a nice Labor Day party.  I'm definitely having another party and then at least one more party before the Labor Day party.  But this is like one of the real big catered events that I'm having.  And it's my sister Dawn's big birthday party. 
[02:08:00]  So we got that going, too.  Same day.  Who's going to DJ die?  They don't even have a DJ.  Do you know how to.  Lady Di is gone.  And I don't know what happened.  Oh.  I think Bill might have yanked the phone out of her hand.  She's gone and there's nothing we could do about it.  Exactly.  Like fucking Mary and Howard's neighbor.  She fucking yanked the phone out of her.  He tired of her yelling.  Choking her right now.  Her toupee's coming off.  It's like, you owe me my money.  Yeah.  Today. 
[02:08:30]  Today.  Yeah, he's choking her with a cell phone.  Yeah.  She's gone.  I don't need her over.  No.  So hopefully she was beaten with the phone by her abusive roommate.  All right, guys.  Well, Carl, thank you.  Thank you for calling and squaring that away.  That whole thing.  Have fun in Philly.  Thanks.  Where are you going to be?  I'm at the Philadelphia Theater Company through July 4th weekend. 
[02:09:00]  Nice.  Very cool.  How are our ticket sales?  Are you going good?  No, our ticket sales are just going swimmingly.  Swimmingly.  No, you're there for a month.  You're not going to sell out every night, but it's going quite well.  That's a pretty good call.  Good for you, Carl.  Are you filming it?  No.  Actually, that kind of fell through, but, you know.  It's a great show.  It's a great show, man.  That shouldn't fall through.  It fell through.  What can I say?  Do it yourself, then.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess I could.  I'm serious.  Hey, Carl. 
[02:09:30]  What the hell?  How did you get back?  Whoa.  Yes.  I'm back again.  I wanted to ask Colin a question.  Yeah.  I hope it's related to my special phone.  Okay.  I was in the middle of a year.  All right.  Yeah.  No, I want to.  This is about car service for me.  How about yourself again?  You get out there, aren't you, young lady?  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  I like your phone.  I mean, are you there? 
[02:10:00]  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Now, I heard something about car service.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  Come and get me and bring me over to Anthony's house.  I can only hope it ends up like Tracy's.  I did say.  Jesus.  Wow.  Don't say that.  Wow.  What?  It's not anything against Tracy.  It's against Di.  I did say that, Diana, but apparently we may have to put a  pin on that one until Labor Day.  Put a pin in that one.  Anthony, it sounds like it's a turn. 
[02:10:30]  Okay.  Well, how about if we get invited over for Labor Day?  Well, we'll see about that, but he's standing strong in his jaw.  He's standing.  Oh, my God.  I mean, I would really like to go to Anthony's house.  Yeah.  Who wouldn't?  I don't blame you.  You're not going to.  It ain't going to happen.  Oh, Anthony.  Well, you know what?  We got to start.  Yeah.  It's over.  Never lose hope, guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  You've got such a big house, you won't even know I'm there.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  It ain't going to happen. 
[02:11:00]  It ain't going to happen.  We'll see about Labor Day.  Yeah.  Well, you know, you're always invited over to my house.  Yeah.  Great.  That's good.  And if I need to increase the bed bugs at my house, I'll go to your house.  Well, you know, I'm just saying.  Yeah.  I know you're just saying.  You, Wolfie, and Jimmy are always invited over here.  I'm just saying no.  Well, if Colin goes, I go.  Okay.  The guy's house?  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe we'll go in July. 
[02:11:30]  We'll make it back down.  I have an outbreak suit.  We'll do a little, uh, Suarway.  Suarway.  Suarway.  Suarway.  We don't have a swimming pool, unfortunately, so.  Oh, well, do you have, like, a hose?  A little sprinkler?  To pool the pond.  Let's get a sprinkler going.  We could do that in your backyard.  No, I don't know if the landlord would like that.  Oh, a sprinkler?  Doesn't this sound like a pisser?  Doesn't that just sound like a pisser going to her house?  We have a backyard and a barbecue.  That's just about it. 
[02:12:00]  Hey, that's nice.  Great.  I'm there.  Yeah.  All right.  Would you go there?  Okay.  No.  Jeez, what I have to go.  I would, I would, I would just like for.  Do you know you're shaped like a Weber grill?  I mean, it'll be Jimmy, Sam, and, uh, maybe even Adrian, you know, the intern, and, uh,  uh, Colin to come over.  All right.  We'll make that happen.  Sitting in busted up, busted up lawn furniture from the 70s.  Especially Colin. 
[02:12:30]  What's going on?  I'd like, I'd like him to be here.  Nice big box of those Mikey burgers.  We have to let you go, you monster.  Yeah.  Let's let you go, you monster.  All right.  Our guests are here, so, um, we, we gotta go.  Thank you, Lady Di.  All right.  Thank you, Colin Quinn.  Thank you.  Oh, come on in.  Don't worry about being quiet.  No, don't even worry about being quiet.  Come right in.  All right.  Take yourself a seat.  We're having a crazy day here.  Oh, my God. 
[02:13:00]  Welcome.  Thank God you guys got here.  Thank God you guys got here.  No, that's good.  If you need to adjust the volume, do you have any volume in there?  Because sometimes they just don't do that.  I do.  It sounds good.  Oh, there we go.  Oh, turn it down a little.  Lovely.  You don't want tinnitus.  No one wants tinnitus.  Ringing in your ears.  I know the ringing.  I don't want it.  It's like someone's thinking about me all the time in my head.  That hates you.  Yes, that hates me.  My ears are ringing.  It must be. 
[02:13:30]  Somebody smells really good.  Oh, thank you.  It's really nice.  It's a delightful scent.  It smells like an angel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the one thing we can control, guys, right?  That is true.  Oh, yes.  Our scent.  Our scent.  Are you wearing anything special or just clean?  Just clean.  Just clean guy?  Lots and lots of deodorant.  That's good.  That's a reapplication.  Oh, reapplying throughout the day.  Applying throughout the day.  Secrets.  Learning secrets.  That is.  Learning some secrets.  I kind of like when a woman doesn't wear deodorant. 
[02:14:00]  I always wear...  No, I'm telling you, there's something sexy about that.  If a woman doesn't wear it, I kind of like...  You like a little musk?  Yeah.  Wow.  I do.  All the time?  Like when you're out to dinner?  Yeah.  It doesn't matter to me.  My ex-girlfriend one time smelled so bad that like I saw someone do a double take when  they walked by.  Were you just like, yeah?  Yeah.  I was really...  I quite enjoyed it.  I was like, yeah, good for you.  And she was...  Wow.  But I enjoyed it.  I feel that you're the first person that said that. 
[02:14:30]  Like that will always be my special memory of you.  Oh, yeah.  There's plenty of people that...  You're just like a dirty pit.  Yeah, a little bit.  A clammy pit.  Yeah, but on a man, it's probably gross.  I get why a woman wouldn't want that on a guy.  Yeah.  Disgusting.  But on a woman.  Yeah.  A little something extra.  Could be a major turnoff though.  Nice.  It smells not right.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You know what I mean?  But I guess you're married.  How the hell did we get here?  I don't know.  It's great.  This is a good...  Yeah, yeah.  How are you doing? 
[02:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  Fine.  How do you do?  I mean, really.  Is it nice to go on a tour together and kind of like plug or is it...  Yeah, it's nice.  I mean, if we...  We're weird.  We like to be together all the time.  Can you imagine if that was...  That is weird.  Somebody get me out of here.  That's a strange thing for a married couple.  No, it's not.  It's been really fun.  We just got in last night, right?  Yeah, last night.  So kind of a quick whirlwind fun time.  Yeah, it's weird because people always like to get away from their spouse and they go out  and like you hear...  But I guess it's nice if you enjoy each other. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We enjoy each other, so it's been good.  We do.  Apparently we don't get...  See, he's a really mellow guy, so I think that helps.  We don't seem to get sick of each other.  Yeah.  Maybe this show is where it all turned around.  This could be a good jump-off point for getting sick of each other.  We've driven a lot of people to divorce.  It was never the same.  Yeah.  It was just after that.  How long have you been married, though?  This will be eight...  We're coming on nine years.  We're coming on nine years.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that is a cracking point. 
[02:16:00]  That's really eight and three quarters of years.  That's about as long as I lasted.  Nine years.  We've been together like 12...  Like 13.  Yeah.  So...  We were incompatible after nine years, me and my wife.  It just changed.  You were incompatible after...  Yeah.  Hold on.  You were incompatible at your wedding night.  You've said it.  Well, that's true.  He cried on his wedding night.  I didn't like that.  After he got married, he...  And it wasn't because it was a beautiful moment.  You got married and then burst out crying?  That night. 
[02:16:30]  It was the kind of tears of regret that she...  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I was like, oh, no.  Did I do this?  None of that before?  You had none of that feeling leading up to?  Oh, I knew.  I knew.  I just...  I was on that rollercoaster thing where you get up to the top and it's like, I can't  get off now.  I should have gotten off.  I should have just jumped.  Yes, apparently.  You should have listened to those tears.  At least I got out of it fast.  Nine years.  Did you cry publicly or was it a solo cry? 
[02:17:00]  It was a very private moment.  It was just me and my wife and she was passed out drunk so she didn't see it.  It was our wedding night.  Oh, marriage wasn't consummated that evening because of alcohol.  There's that.  Have you gone on other radio shows where people have just kind of opened up and begun  to break down in front of you?  This is the first.  Is it real?  We're learning about sex and breakdowns.  Yeah, nine years, though.  That is kind of a tricky time.  That was when I decided I wanted to have sex with other girls. 
[02:17:30]  There's that, sure.  And that will usually throw a little monkey wrench into a marriage.  It's probably not great for a marriage.  No, especially one that was never good from day one.  That was, like, really bad.  I bought my engagement ring at a jewelry store in Penn Station on my way up to Propos.  I was like, I've got to do this.  It was really bad.  It was an old Pepsi tank full of that.  Yes, it was just one of those one-size-fits-all, like the gumball machine with the split bottoms. 
[02:18:00]  So you could, you know.  I don't want to make this a depressing interview.  I know.  What the hell?  Let's talk about genocide.  Yeah, enough about me.  There's the uptoids.  Two people talk about me for a while.  How did you guys meet?  We met at the Groundlings Theater.  We met at improv class.  And Ben did, like, a really super creepy guy in prison.  I was so creepy.  I did an inmate.  I was like, because I didn't know.  I was like, oh, I'll do a monologue.  I'll be an inmate.  And I'm like, hi, Jerry.  And I thought it would be maybe sort of funny. 
[02:18:30]  And nobody did.  But then there's Melissa, and she's sort of smiling.  And I was like, hey, one person likes this.  For some reason, I was like, hey, that guy's super creepy.  I think I'm going to marry him.  My kind of guy.  It was really odd.  And for some reason, I was like, he's odd.  He will be mine.  He will be mine.  They have, like, an amazing history of comic talent about this, too.  Yeah, it's crazy.  I think they kind of get overlooked, because everybody talks about, like, Second City, who are great.  But people don't talk about the Groundlings as much as they should.  It's just so many people. 
[02:19:00]  I mean, Phil Hartman and Will Ferrell and Sherry Oteri and Kristen Wiig and, you know, Annie Mumolo.  Like, it's pretty crazy.  Who are these people?  I'm just naming family members.  My Aunt Marlene.  My Aunt Uncle Jerry.  Little Tim, Big Tim.  Big Little Tim.  So you were just kind of doing, like, improv scenes there?  Yeah.  You start kind of doing improvising, and then as you move up in classes, you start writing. 
[02:19:30]  And that's where they, it kind of gets crazy, because it was the first time I ever wrote anything,  and they literally say, go out in the hallway, you have five minutes, and write a monologue.  Here's your topic.  Wow.  Damn.  I was like, what?  And hers is really good.  I was like, what?  I'm doing creepy inmates over here.  I don't know if it's good.  I was afraid to write it, so I would just kind of stand there with a blank page, and I would improvise.  And just wing it and be like, yeah, I wrote some good stuff here.  Yeah, I was too nervous to, because I was like, I don't really, I don't know how to write. 
[02:20:00]  So I literally would just stand there with a fake page, and then Ben was the only one that, when I sat down, he goes, I know your page is blank.  I know what game you're running.  I write very light in pencil.  I just didn't see it.  That's better to do, though.  That's so smart, because you can just kind of go anywhere you want to, and just act like it was a part of it.  And it'll seem brilliant, like you wrote it.  Did you write in that stuttering and just staring for 30 seconds?  Yes.  Yes.  It's a series of dashes and stars.  It came up as very uncomfortable.  It almost seemed like you had no idea what you were going to say. 
[02:20:30]  She really does awkward well.  I was doing a scene in acting class, and it was just so, like, you're doing a scene, and you're like, oh, my God, this is terrible and unbelievable.  And they're all just silently humiliated for me.  Ooh.  Yeah, it's really awkward, Joey.  I mean, for sure.  I mean, we've tanked horribly at the ground.  And comedy.  I mean, comedy is so honest.  You know, you're just out there.  Yeah, yeah.  You're like, here's the part where people should theoretically be laughing, and you're looking at me like you'd love to slaughter me.  And it's when you try harder, because you're like, this one's going to kill him, and then it's just, all you feel is, like, thick hate coming back. 
[02:21:00]  I mean, we've done stuff where, like, literally as the lights came up, I don't know why, but, like, in rehearsals, it's like, this is so funny.  The lights came up for a live audience, and the second those lights come up, you think, there's nothing funny about this.  And now I'm in for four minutes, and I've got a stupid wig on, and, like, a crazy outfit.  And the audience is, you just see arms crossing, and people are, like, just shaking their head and hating your guts, and you're like, oh, there's no way to make it quicker. 
[02:21:30]  Yep.  It's got to be almost over.  Okay, that was ten seconds.  Yep.  No, it gets, it's just sketching.  It's so hard, because you can't get out of it.  You can't say, I go, and I stand out, like, I'm like, what do you do?  If it's bombing, you just got to commit to it.  You got to keep going.  Yeah.  You can't.  It seems like a stand-up, because you kind of, like, you know, you're like, oh, this whole thing seems weird.  I'm going to go this way, or that way, and in the sketch, you're theoretically pretending to be this person.  So, unless you're saying, you tell the audience, I'm no longer this person. 
[02:22:00]  I'm no longer doing this.  Do not acknowledge the previous person that I was.  Yeah, because Jimmy talks about doing stand-up, and how, if it's not going well, you can just, you could acknowledge that it's not going well.  You could change direction.  The old, thanks, good night.  Or just bail, right.  Or you can just really cleanse yourself and turn on them.  That's always really satisfying, when you can just blame them.  But if you're in a scene, man, that's really difficult.  You don't know what it's like to be up here. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, that works.  Tom Hanks in Punchline.  That's what most stand-up is like.  Yikes.  It's real.  It's real, guys.  Are you still doing Mike and Molly?  Yeah.  I go back in about three or four weeks.  How many years is that for you guys?  This will be going into our fifth year.  Wow.  Yeah.  That went fast.  That's a nice crew.  There's a good stand-up.  Billy.  Yeah, he's great.  Billy Riddell.  What a dreamboat.  That's a nice...  He's just a nice guy.  Yeah, he's like one of those.  Like, every day, he comes in in his, like, beautiful 1950s car, usually playing nothing 
[02:23:00]  earlier than...  Like, I don't even know if he dabs into the 60s.  Like, it's like something from the 1950s in his car.  And then every day, he literally is like, well, they let me on the lot again.  Like, just every day, surprise.  He's like, look at this.  The cards still work.  Right.  Like, he's just...  He's about the best guy in the world, so...  But that's a true stand-up.  Just never believing anything is actually happening that's good.  The actors are all buying homes in season one, and he's like, oh, fuck it.  A $300 a month rent.  A $200 syndication.  You know, that's just... 
[02:23:30]  You keep expecting things to fall apart.  They usually do.  Yeah.  Expect the worst.  Was that your first major gig, or no?  No, not on TV.  I did a...  I had a little part on a show that ran for seven years called Gilmore Girls.  Oh, yeah.  A little tiny part on it, but it was nice, steady work for seven years, so that was like  my first...  That was my first job where I'm like, I...  Oh, my God.  I actually...  I get a paycheck every week.  On a TV talk show, that would have gotten an applaud right there, though, where it's  like, on a show of Gilmore Girls.  Woo! 
[02:24:00]  And it's like, yeah, thank you, thank you.  I would have gotten that, like, you know, tonight's show or something.  Yeah.  You remember the Gilmore Girls.  You know.  Thank you, I guess.  I love when people come out and want that applause right away, and they pause before  the clap.  I'm always like, oh, don't do that.  Sometimes applause are so awkward.  The worst is that a Happy Days character coming on, like Chachi or somebody, come on.  Hey, Mr. C, I... 
[02:24:30]  Woo!  They gotta stand there, kinda look around, but still be in character.  I feel like the...  What was the dad's name?  Tom Bosley?  Yeah.  Who would literally, like, tip of the old...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Break hair.  He could not even try to be like...  Yeah, yeah.  He literally, like, took a bow.  I was like, all right.  There's that one, and then there's the weird thing that doesn't happen these days in music,  but in, like, the 70s, the middle of the song applause.  Really?  Where it was like, like, Barry Manilow. 
[02:25:00]  It would be...  I write the songs.  Woo!  And everyone would applaud in the middle of the song, like, when he changed key or something.  And I was like, why are they...  Why would they do this?  You're ruining the melody.  Yeah.  You're ruining the melody.  And I really did like I write the songs.  But really, if Barry was here and singing, I would applaud all the way through.  You Light Up My Life was another middle-of-the-song applause.  Dun-dun.  And you...  Woo! 
[02:25:30]  I love you, Barry!  Wait for the end.  I couldn't even wait for the end.  Happy Days and Barry Manilow.  You couldn't be on a more pop-culture-relevant radio show.  Look at me.  Yes!  I'm on a virtual super train of...  No?  Remember that show?  I do.  I do, actually.  Now we just talked about Angie Dickinson and really rounded out...  Yeah!  How sexy was she in Dress to Kill, though, when she dropped that glove and the guy waved  it and they had sex and then she got killed in the elevator?  Sexy when O.J. dropped the glove. 
[02:26:00]  So you're...  And we're back.  Yes!  Thank you.  What is the movie about?  We only have a few minutes of here.  Oh, Tammy.  Yeah, that's why we're here.  Tammy is...  Hello.  Ben and I wrote this.  We've worked on about five or six years.  And it's about my character, Tammy, that basically cannot get out of her way.  And hates her job, hates her marriage, kind of is in this terrible little town.  And we figured, how hard does she have to get hit to kind of get off the hamster wheel? 
[02:26:30]  So we hit her pretty hard, take away her job, kind of take away every single thing and  she's got to get out of town.  And the only one with a car is her drunk, alcoholic grandmother, played by the delightful  Susan Sarandon.  And we hit the road.  Yeah.  And go see Kathy Bates.  Yeah, you get to see Kathy Bates.  And Dan Aykroyd and Allison Janney.  Yeah, it's a really funny, wild, you know, thing.  Why did it take five years?  Were you guys just kind of taking your time with it or is it hard for anybody just to  get something made?  Should we take long breaks? 
[02:27:00]  Busy.  We did like one word a day.  So it kind of took me.  I need a break.  No, we just, we started it, you know, when we had the idea and then it took a while before  anybody was like, yeah, we'll read it.  So when they were finally ready, we were like, yes, we actually have something.  But it's even, that's even if you have trouble getting stuff read, that's just depressing  for the rest of us.  Because if you have to go through the hoops, none of us have a shot.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, no way.  You got to get some clout first.  I got to get some clout.  You got some clout. 
[02:27:30]  That's what happened.  Are you handling all the success well?  Because you, like, in the last, like, five or six years, like, you're really through the  roof.  It's, uh, it's pretty delightful.  It's, it's nice to work.  I just always wanted to, to work steadily and to stop worrying about my electric bill  and stop looking in my couch for random changes.  So the fact that I'm like, I'm just going to use my ATM.  I can go and fill up gas without a hot sweat of panic.  Thank you for answering my, my really, my fucking old grandmother question I asked. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, boy, you're going through the roof.  How has it been treating you?  I should be executed.  Fucking asshole.  You're a silt.  And you pretty much.  He was giving me hot milk, uh, while he was asking me that question.  Just a little bit.  Just a tiny sip of warm milk.  Mammoth.  Yeah, you look chilly.  All right.  So they, yeah, they got to go.  Oh, yes.  You're promoting, promoting.  Listen, guys.  It's really delightful, though. 
[02:28:30]  Tammy is in, uh, theaters, uh, next Wednesday, July 2nd.  You don't, you don't even need much trouble, uh, much help plugging it.  Obviously, your films always do well.  That's a good date movie, right?  No, don't do it like that.  That's almost like, ah, don't go.  Who cares?  Good date movie.  There you go.  Great date movie.  See?  It really is.  People don't want to go to, like, scary movies and stuff like that.  They want to go to a nice romance, funny thing.  Exactly.  Perfect.  If people like nudity, tell them there's nudity.  But if they don't, tell them there's none.  Tell them there's none.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  But don't tell them it's Kathy Bates, even though she was nude in one movie.  Yeah, she was.  And she did very well.  The Nicholson movie.  Yeah, yeah.  About Schmidt.  She's so great.  She was great in Misery.  What a great associate.  Oh, Misery is fantastic.  Yeah.  She's bionic.  She's bionic.  True.  I'm really going out on a limb saying Misery was fantastic.  Yeah, we really...  Look out.  I take chances.  Yeah, we're really good.  I said the Groundlings were funny, and your career is going well.  Well, you heard it here, folks.  We ought to get TMZ on the phone and start telling them this stuff. 
[02:29:30]  It's crazy.  Breaking the fucking...  Well, thank you, guys.  We apologize.  Oh, God.  Melissa and Ben, thank you very much.  Very cool.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  All right, Mark.  We could do a montage of the first things we say when these mics go on.  Oh, that would be funny.  Because even after all these years, it's just dumb little noises.  Noises.  Ah, ah, ah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
[02:30:00]  Welcome, welcome, welcome aboard. 
[02:30:30]  Welcome aboard.  The Opie and Anthony show is back.  The Opie and Anthony show is back.  And better than ever.  On Sirius XM.  Back and better than ever, my God.  Sounds like a great radio show.  Better than ever.  I want to thank Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone for stopping by for that strange interview.  We were kind of rushed.  Yeah.  We didn't really have a lot of time with them. 
[02:31:00]  Because they went late on Howard, I guess.  Hoo-hoo.  But if we, whatever, we keep a guest late.  All hell breaks loose, but.  Yeah.  Wow, it was still fun.  Oh, yeah.  She's very nice.  She's a nice lady.  Yeah, they're both really nice.  They're fucked if they get divorced.  Jesus.  They came up, like, together.  But maybe they will get divorced.  Maybe they'll last.  Oh, I know.  I just said, if, you know.  Yeah.  Happens. 
[02:31:30]  50%, I think, right?  Are we still at that 50%?  Everybody says 50% of all married couples get divorced.  No, it's way over that.  It's way over that now?  Yeah, it's at least 60.  Jesus.  Is it really?  Yeah, at least.  Look at them, Sam.  Sam Roberts, our man at the computer.  Yeah, more than half of this part.  You know, man is kind of a.  Get, uh, divorced.  Sam's a fuckable twink at our computer.  No disrespect.  Not taken.  I didn't mean to talk about armpit odor.  It was fucking funny. 
[02:32:00]  Why not?  I'm just saying, I didn't plan on that.  It just happens.  She loved it.  She thought it was funny.  I understood what you were saying, though.  You get that, uh, that natural, uh, uh, smell there.  It's so natural.  But the problem is, sometimes it just smells horrific.  Oh, you got, uh, your stat?  Got a stat there?  Sam Roberts?  Need a mic.  Mr. Microphone.  Yeah, you're talking to the mic. 
[02:32:30]  That's a euphemism, by the way, when I'm putting his head in my lap.  I grabbed that fucking Juan Epstein hair of his, and I'm like, I'll show you how to  executive kiss.  Executive kiss.  You don't like the idea of that?  That's gruesome.  That's so creepy.  That is creepy.  There's nothing you can mistake it for.  Like, nothing else is happening.  You don't like a hand in your curly hair and another hand roughly holding you by the  kidneys?  Executive kiss him.  Um, the statistics, 50% of first marriages end in divorce, 67% of second, and 74% of 
[02:33:00]  third marriages.  Who the fuck would get married three times?  That's insanity to me.  Two times is insane.  I think two times is insane.  Absolutely.  Once you fucking blow it, that's it.  That is it.  Yeah, man.  Something you realize, ah, not meant for me. 
[02:33:30]  Yes.  I don't believe in love, either.  What?  I just think it's lust.  That, like, lust, and then it forms into a habit.  No.  Like, you grow used to it like a habit.  So, at first, it's very lustful, right?  Yeah.  And then, you get this whole, oh, I'm in love thing. 
[02:34:00]  But it's this lustful thing.  It's this coveting thing that you get.  And then, it becomes like this habit.  People get used to things.  Things they like being set in their ways.  Just like, you know, eh, it's the same way to work every morning.  It's the same this, the same that.  And then, you know, you look at that as the same thing.  Because if it was actual love, like, as it's defined, you'd never get mad at that person.  You'd never.  Because it was love at first. 
[02:34:30]  So, then why all of a sudden does it turn into this thing where now you can criticize, get mad, yell, say horrible things?  That's not the love thing.  What happened?  Thank you.  I think there's probably more than one type of relationship.  Because you've been in relationships where it's habitual.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then in relationships where you're actually in love.  It doesn't settle in enough to let anything, like, grow and...  You know what you have to do, Ant?  And prosper.  In order to love somebody, you actually have to let your guard down. 
[02:35:00]  I've let my guard down plenty of times.  And I assumed that I was in love many times, especially in my younger days.  And then I realized, it can't be love if you're heartbroken when it ends.  But then the second you find another girl to fuck, you don't give a shit about that other girl.  A lot of people don't go through it that way.  That means it wasn't love to begin with.  But that's what a lot of people go through.  You didn't let it settle.  It grows. 
[02:35:30]  There are a lot of people...  So does fungus.  If you allow it, it will grow into something pretty damn meaningful.  Why would it have to grow into something that you can all of a sudden not...  How come all of a sudden you're in love still, like you were at the beginning, when everything's cool,  but now you're yelling at each other.  But you're still in love.  It grows from that point, but for some reason you don't allow that.  No, I do.  Mm-mm.  I do, but it grows into something that sucks.  No, it doesn't.  It grows into something that you start yelling at each other and criticizing and picking. 
[02:36:00]  But no, you don't.  I mean, you get into fights at times, but it's...  Fights!  You wouldn't get...  If it was real love, I say no fighting.  Just like the beginning.  You have to grow together as people.  What?  Nothing wrong with a good fight.  Right, you gotta fight a little bit.  Like, you fight with your family.  You love your family, though.  I fight with my family.  And then you're in the doghouse, and then you have makeup sex.  You do get to have makeup sex.  I don't like makeup sex because I still hold a resentment, and it fucking doesn't make me feel good. 
[02:36:30]  I'm like, no, fuck you!  Well, if you're in love, you probably don't hold on to resentments.  If you're holding on to resentments, maybe you're not in love.  Have you ever been in love?  For real?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Okay, there you go.  I think I...  No, no, but the thing is, I think I thought I was, and I thought I knew what it was.  I want to know what love is!  Hey, look, look, look.  I want you to show me!  It's a monologue today.  You want to know what Anthony's in love is?  Ask the fucking question. 
[02:37:00]  Anthony's in love at the bottom of a bottle.  Oh, no.  That's dramatic 50s speak.  I heard that.  I don't remember now.  Oh, no.  Just ask him.  Don't be shy.  Oh, no.  No, you threw me off.  Oh, shit.  So, how quick does it settle into habit?  What?  You said it starts with lust, and then it just becomes a habit.  Oh, I know what I was going to say.  You're smart enough to know.  Were you or were you not ever in love?  You're a smart guy. 
[02:37:30]  I think I was, but I don't think there is really such thing, so whatever it was, I was in that.  I think you're holding back for whatever reason.  No.  Mm-hmm.  I don't think so.  What do you mean?  Oh, I get it.  So, you think technically has to be.  You were never in love, but neither has anyone else ever been.  Thank you.  It's true.  Anthony's a animal maniac.  That's right.  Duh.  I don't know.  I, um...  Give Elizabeth McCarty back on. 
[02:38:00]  I, uh...  Wow.  Who is that?  Spencer.  Who the fuck is that?  Well, someone you're going to fall in love with.  Are you in love, Anthony?  I think I'm in love.  See, you just fell in love.  You want to smooch with her asshole while she grabs her ankles?  I don't know.  Where are you at now?  Are you in a relationship?  Nah, I'm not in anything.  I'm fucking...  You can come out of a fight, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:38:30]  And actually have a stronger relationship.  Ugh.  Did you know that?  You learned a thing or two, right, Sam?  That's right, you did.  Sammy!  And you improve yourself and watch as your partner improves her or himself.  That's right.  Right?  That's right.  Wow.  Thank you for that.  Actually, thank you, Jim.  Actually, I'm not into that.  What?  I'll have a few.  Nothing crazy.  Do you yell when you fight or do you guys just kind of silently know each other?  A little of both, I guess.  But it doesn't happen a lot.  Because that's where I do agree with Anthony.  If you're fighting a lot, it's not fucking worth it. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, boy.  Who's more likely to apologize?  Both, really, yeah.  MSNBC?  MSNBC.  If it's fair, if it's fair.  No, I think if you're in a good relationship, it's pretty equal to the apologizing and all  that.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah, why not?  I've never fucking gotten an apology in my life.  For real?  I'm always the one, sorry, just to end it.  Sorry.  To end the fight.  Sorry.  But you're not supposed to do that.  Yeah.  Then I resent the shit out of the fact that I had to say sorry. 
[02:39:30]  You've got to live in the fight.  Oh, shit.  No, end the fight.  Until it gets better.  End it.  Hold on a minute.  Let's say hi to Mike in Houston.  Mike, hey.  The phone's lit.  Mike.  Hold on, hold on.  Houston, we got a problem.  What's up, Mike?  What?  Hey, man.  Hope you're wrong.  Fucking makeup sex sucks.  You're fucking around, stupid.  Whoa.  Dude, my wife puts makeup on me and butt fucks me and it's horrible.  Oh, I was saying makeup sex.  I apologize.  He puts on.  I happen to think that you're wrong, sir. 
[02:40:00]  That, to me, sounds like fun.  You never had on a pair of panties and a girl saying,  take it, bitch, while you wore lipstick.  You haven't lived, my friend.  That really happened?  It's lovely.  I would never put on lipstick.  Have I ever told, take it, bitch, you better have.  No, I think it's goofy when you say,  oh, we're going to have makeup sex now.  Makeup sex.  That's the best.  Yeah, because you want to, like, look into the face you were just arguing with  and be like, you know what? 
[02:40:30]  You still got the better of me, you fucking bitch.  You both have argument breath, talking breath.  There's nothing worse than argument breath.  Argument breath.  But you think you were in love once.  Yeah.  That's interesting.  Yeah, because, like, all through.  Do you think you were still?  No, I think I was in whatever people misconceive as love.  I was in that.  Were you in lust?  It was, yeah, a lot of lust.  You throw a lot of lust in it.  I know.  And then you throw in jealousy. 
[02:41:00]  It's like a little bit of jealousy, a little shit like that.  So then if some other, you know, she's talking to some other guys,  then you add in the jealousy factor,  and that makes you seem like you really care about this girl more,  but it's just that you don't want anyone else to have her.  So that's part of this love mixture thing.  It's narcissism.  I know who you're talking about.  I know what you want.  I know who you're talking about, and I think you were in love.  No, no, no.  It's not anything.  Yeah, I thought I was in love, I guess. 
[02:41:30]  It had all the signs.  Oh, this is one.  But it's one of those, I don't know.  When did you realize you were never in love then?  When I reassessed what I think love is,  and I think it's very biological,  I think it's very, you know,  it's this human condition.  I don't think there's this thing where it's like,  oh, kismet and magical and fuck. 
[02:42:00]  I just think it's, you know, you want, you want, you get, you have,  love, and then after a while you, you know.  I think the problem is most people settle,  because what they're feeling at the time they think is love,  but it actually isn't love.  Exactly.  So that's where I do agree with you.  Yeah, but I think that's a lot of what it is.  You've got to take your time with that shit,  but after a while people are like,  you know what, this is kind of going well,  I think I'm in love, and then you move on and you're stuck. 
[02:42:30]  I think you like turning feelings off.  No, I love feelings.  Do you?  No, you're scared of feelings.  No.  You're absolutely scared of feelings.  Feelings walk around like the fucking, the ring.  They crawl upside down with their legs twisting the wrong way.  That's feelings to me.  Give me that song, feelings.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, feelings.  Feelings.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, feelings.  Think about it.  I am being psychoanalyzed on them. 
[02:43:00]  Well.  Talking everywhere else on the phones and everything.  But, you know, it's just what I think, what I believe, what I've seen over the years.  And it's my assumption, my hypotheses.  I think you're afraid to be in love, and so you're turning it off because you're saying,  well, that's just some weird biological.  Sam Roberts, that's not true.  I wanted to be in love.  Wanted?  Wanted for many years.  But now you're turning it off.  When did you want to be in love?  You were in love with Melinda.  My entire life.  Yeah, I did love Melinda. 
[02:43:30]  That's who I was talking about.  But I don't think, but I think that is just a mixture of things.  I don't know.  I don't think it's a thing.  Nothing loves a thing.  Than eating large quantities of chocolate.  Yeah.  There you go.  But he's technically right.  It's chemically the same thing.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think there's this, I don't know.  No, I wanted to for many years, of course, growing up.  Ever since I was fucking like 13, 14 years old, you see, oh my God, I want to be in love.  I want to love.  But now you don't anymore. 
[02:44:00]  No, now I don't really give a shit because I don't think it's real.  I don't think it's a real thing.  If you love yourself too much, I don't think you could fall in love.  Is that what it is?  Absolutely.  I do rule, though.  Absolutely.  I mean, that's true.  I'm just saying in general.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think if you love yourself too much, then it makes it very hard to fall in love.  I don't think it's real.  She should love me a lot more.  Exactly.  Because I love me like this much.  This much.  This much.  This much.  Your fucking ego gets in the way.  I'm like Uday Hussain.  I'm just in love with myself. 
[02:44:30]  Let's say hi to Brad in Ohio.  Brad.  What's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Bradley.  Hey, what's up?  I agree with that, man.  I've been the same girl.  When we first started off, it was like,  we had fun.  And then, like,  it became like a routine.  And then we got,  it was just like,  left off it.  She kind of just,  one day got up,  like,  all right,  we're friends now.  Let's leave.  And what's funny is that  friends on my way downtown to be here  discussing about this. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, but you shouldn't allow all that shit to happen.  Well, no, I understand that.  But, like...  You know what?  That stuff is starting to, like,  seep in.  You got to make sure you push it back out.  Yeah, seepage.  Yeah, man.  She's very vocal.  Not very vocal about the relationship,  first of all, man.  Like,  it's just like,  now she wants to say,  like,  all right,  let's start over again  and be friends  and get this love again.  And I'm like,  fuck that.  What happens if eight years  or nine years from now  it fucking becomes another routine. 
[02:45:30]  And we're just like,  whatever.  Right.  It's a made-up thing.  Well, maybe you weren't in love  to begin with.  I don't know.  That's true, too.  And that's what you were saying earlier.  A lot of people,  I see it in all my circles.  They just end up settling.  It's like,  yeah,  this is kind of good.  This is kind of good  and comfortable.  Hey, man,  I'm fucking guilty of it.  I stay in a relationship  five years too long, probably.  I'm trying to do the math real fast.  I stay in a relationship  five years too long  because it was comfortable. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Right.  It wasn't miserable.  It wasn't miserable.  But it wasn't great.  It was just comfortable.  Just familiar.  And familiar.  That familiarity,  that force of habit almost.  People get very complacent.  They love routine.  Believe it or not,  humans aren't these  amazing excitement creatures.  They love a good routine  for the most part.  I fucking hate routines.  And when you have a relationship  that gets routine, 
[02:46:30]  you really don't want to go through  the whole thing of,  oh, I gotta fucking do this and that.  That's why people stay in jobs  for a long time.  They really,  the thought of,  oh, I gotta do this,  that, that,  to get somewhere else,  it just,  it's too much.  So a lot of people  stay in relationships,  call it love,  when it's really not.  To have it.  Oh, I agree with you on that.  Certainly.  Let's say hi to payday  in Cleveland.  Payday.  Hey, I really don't think  Anthony's ever been in love.  I mean,  he's talking about  letting his guard down, 
[02:47:00]  and this is coming from a man  who walks around  his own house armed.  I mean,  you know,  people do break into houses,  people.  Anyone that says that  is stupid.  If someone kicks my door in  and I go,  hold on,  my gun's upstairs.  Shut it.  It's on my hip,  motherfucker.  I love you getting  home invaded  is so fucking low.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, it never happens.  Never happens.  I'm not saying it never happens.  Never happens.  Well,  there you go.  In my neighborhood.  How do you know?  How the fuck do you know  how many homes are robbed 
[02:47:30]  in my neighborhood?  It happens all the time,  people.  And let me tell you,  if it happens,  you'll be the one  that's sitting there going,  man,  I wish I had a gun on my hip.  Shut it.  This is Anthony, though.  He's like,  I don't think love exists.  However,  there's a good possibility  that somebody may break  into my house  and I need to be armed  at all times.  I'm not saying  a good possibility.  I'm just saying,  you know,  the odds are  you're going to get in your car  and not crash,  but boy,  click that seatbelt on.  Ah,  ah,  ah.  It's true.  That's what I say. 
[02:48:00]  What?  No,  it's not more so  because it's the law.  People do it  because,  you know,  it's a safety thing.  Why not?  Oh,  wow.  Why not?  All right,  thank you.  How many of you both sink?  There's life preserves on us.  We're going to move on  to Justin in Oklahoma.  Justin.  Just in time.  Oh,  no shit.  Fucking clever.  What's up,  man?  If you don't believe in love,  you certainly can't believe in hate.  But I know that you hate  a lot of motherfuckers.  Oh,  Jesus.  Yeah,  then maybe hate doesn't exist.  Oh, 
[02:48:30]  man.  Love and hate.  Hate would be,  yes,  the same thing.  We sound like a bunch of 13-year-old boys  after our third Meister Brown.  If you don't love something,  you can't hate it.  You know,  I say,  if you love something,  you set it free,  right?  And then if it comes back,  then something happens.  Yes,  but how do you throw racism  out the window?  See if it comes back.  Oh,  it always does.  One new story.  It was meant to be.  I don't know. 
[02:49:00]  It's just my thing.  You know,  I'm not saying it's exactly  what it is,  but I haven't heard any  things that convince me  that there's this  all-wonderful love  that people have  for each other.  I think every relationship  starts out  as this amazing thing.  Amazing!  That first few months,  holy fuckaroni!  It's just mind-boggling.  And then,  meh.  That's why I've taken  to not really 
[02:49:30]  getting into relationships.  But why hasn't  your hate dropped then?  Because hate  to a more comfort  hate level.  It's just wonderful.  It's a furnace  that keeps the generator going.  But your hate  is just as strong  as day one.  Oh,  it really is.  Oh,  just wonderful.  Todd in South Carolina.  Todd.  Hey,  how are you guys  this morning?  All right.  I kind of agree  with both of you.  I think when it comes  to love,  there's only one  true love. 
[02:50:00]  That's your parents,  your siblings,  and then your dog.  Don't forget  the love of a child.  Shut up.  Sure.  I'm just kidding.  Yeah,  you'll love them  even though they  make booty  on your penis.  Oh,  God.  Go ahead,  Todd.  Okay,  sorry.  But I hope  he made a good point  I think a few years ago.  He said that people  now are wearing,  you know,  colognes  and deodorants  and all that,  so you're not getting  the pheromone. 
[02:50:30]  No,  that's why,  chemical.  Well,  I mean,  people laugh  to Jimmy  when Jimmy  says he likes  the smell  of a woman's pits  or whatever  or her natural scent.  I think that's  really important  because I think  biologically  you're attracted  to certain scents  and stuff  and maybe  that makes  more sense  as far as  nature goes  and we're all  tricking each other  with these fake scents.  You know,  when I,  there's a few perfumes  that I smell,  they could be  on a fat pig.  It drives me nuts  because I like that smell.  Right, right.  And you might be 
[02:51:00]  tricked into  going pigging even.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  That's right.  So it might even be,  it might be better off  for society  and human beings  to not wear,  you know,  scents.  Yeah.  And get that natural  smell of the individual  because when you smell  a bad one,  you know you don't want  to be with that person.  Oh, yeah.  But if she's wearing  some kind of,  I don't know,  Kim Kardashian scent,  you might be tricked.  Well,  she tricked me.  Who knows?  Who the fuck knows? 
[02:51:30]  It's a great mystery.  Kim Kardashian scent  she probably smells  like money.  Am I right or wrong?  Oh, shit.  You like dismissive  regular guy?  All right,  Rob's going to explain  this to you, Anthony.  Rob in Minnesota.  Right there, Rob.  Rob?  Yes.  I think, Anthony,  it might be a little childish.  Let's just start off  with the fact that  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  Oh, you stop it.  All right.  You stop it now.  Relationship starts off 
[02:52:00]  with the upward roller coaster.  But, Anthony,  relationships don't remain  that way  because people  get to know each other  and God is exciting.  That doesn't mean  love went away, Anthony.  That just means  things aren't exciting,  little boy  with the propeller hat on.  So let's...  How does he know  why I'm wearing  my propeller hat today?  Because I've been tweeting  the photos of you.  Oh.  Of you.  I don't know.  Don't talk to me  like that, sir.  You're being very childish. 
[02:52:30]  Exactly.  I understand  what you're saying.  I don't agree with it.  No, the bond grows, man.  It really...  I know.  The bond grows,  but then you lose  something else.  It's replaced  by something else.  You know what  damages the bond, though?  One big pair of tits  bobbling down the street.  Boy, that bond  gets slipped off.  Bobbling!  Jesus.  Boy, one pair  of giant fat tits  bobbling down the street.  Not only does that bond  break, 
[02:53:00]  but I'm looking for  a thing to fill  with acid  and put her in  and throw a body  in the Hudson.  Let's see.  This guy  from Florida.  Who's the guy?  Brady.  What's up, Brady?  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Brady.  Yes?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Brady.  I am calling  from West Palm Beach  where Jim Norton  will be July 10th,  11th, and 12th.  That's very good, Brady. 
[02:53:30]  Thank you.  I see Jimmy.  Anyway,  I want to call  to say I agree  completely with Anthony.  I've been married  for like a year  and a half.  And already  I fall in love  with every girl  that walks by  in yoga pants.  I know.  How do you resist?  Right?  I love that.  I literally say that  when a girl walks by  and you say,  oh, I fucking love you.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  But that's why  I don't do it either, dude,  because I'm the same way. 
[02:54:00]  It's really hard  and I know  I'm just going to wreck it.  Like, if it's right,  it'll be right,  but I'll wreck it  if it's...  I know I'll ruin it  because I'm too...  I fall in love  too quick.  Well, I've already  wrecked it  by cheating on her  in the first year  and she wants to work on it.  How'd you cheat?  How'd you get caught?  Well, I'm in recovery myself  and had almost seven years  and went out  and it all started with,  you know,  talking to this girl  I used to work with. 
[02:54:30]  It was younger.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that'll do it.  Oh, that'll do it.  Wait, you didn't make  the old classic,  oh, no,  when you go out and cheat  and you come home  and your wife's on the couch  and you take your dick  and you rub it  under her nose  and you say,  guess what I've been doing?  Oh, that mistake.  No, I resisted that urge.  I guess what I did.  As soon as I checked  into a detox,  they said, 
[02:55:00]  oh, you don't need your phone,  so why don't you  give it to your wife?  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  That's not good.  Yep, there you go.  Wow.  You should have ate  the phone right  in front of everybody.  I did a reset.  Oh, wow.  Imagine just spiking it  on the floor  and smashing it  into a bunch of pieces.  Ooh, whoopsie.  This phone!  Butterfingers!  Oops!  Wait, dude,  why didn't you just  passcode lock it?  Uh, I'm an idiot. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, my God.  Well, that even  raises suspicion.  Yeah, Jimmy, Jesus.  Jimmy, why is it  passcode locked?  Right.  There's nothing worse  than playing  the hot potato game  when your girlfriend  wants to see  a picture on your phone  or something  and you turn it  towards her  and go,  here, look,  and you're like,  please don't text now.  Please don't text now.  Jesus.  You gotta put it  on silent  so no texts show up.  You're crazy.  Yeah, but the little  name shows up. 
[02:56:00]  No, you don't get anything.  Banners know nothing.  Nothing.  But why would be  with anyone then?  You should just  fool around.  Well, yeah.  That sounds like  a good thing to do.  You have like a, um...  There's enough gals  out there that'll  play it your way.  But not a fool  around thing.  It's just like  a hangout thing.  Like hangout.  The second it starts  turning into  a relationship,  it's done.  But if they all know  they're just hanging out,  then, you know,  everyone would be 
[02:56:30]  better off  and you wouldn't have  to fucking stress  about it.  Here's the problem  though with that  strategy.  Believe it or not,  I am kind of fun  to hang out with.  I know it sounds  insane with the  throwing around  of racial epithets  and everything.  You're Mr. Fun.  Mr. Fun.  You're a chick  and a very fun guy.  I like treating  a girl very nicely.  You've got a Jersey Shore nickname,  Mr. Fun.  Very nicely  and stuff like that.  And sometimes  things get misinterpreted 
[02:57:00]  as a relationship.  And then...  So what did you tell him?  But in the old days,  here it is,  the old Anthony  used to say,  oh yes,  okay, great,  and then figure out,  now how can I lie  to keep this going  but, you know,  but be myself  and do, you know,  hang out with other people.  Now I'm very  to the point.  I don't want  a relationship.  I don't want to be  anyone's boyfriend.  I can't do that.  But I'm not always... 
[02:57:30]  Well, except you, Jimmy.  Our little secret  here on the air.  Not so much a secret  we talk about every day.  A couple of Peter Pumpers.  But it's one of those situations,  you know.  You just...  Like,  you've got to be blunt.  Very honest.  But it's like,  sometimes if you're just nice,  people misinterpret this  as, you know,  you're being a boyfriend.  Yeah.  It's not true.  Especially the fatties.  He says that. 
[02:58:00]  Sir.  Bravo.  All right, Brady.  Good job.  Let me say,  why did you think  we were dating?  You didn't throw me  down the stairs.  Wow.  Let's go to Steve  in Iowa.  Steve.  Yes.  Oh, hi, old B.  Hi, Steve.  Oh, hi.  Actually,  I was going to kind of  wait for Jimmy's advice,  Cheryl,  but now's a good time.  I'm 26 years old  and I've been with  the same girl  for four years 
[02:58:30]  and every fucking person  I run into  that we know  is just pushing  for engagement.  All right.  Well,  just be honest  with yourself right now.  Do you want to marry her?  I don't know.  I mean,  sometimes I do.  Are you scared  to get married?  Yes.  Mm.  Good.  Yeah,  and don't do it.  How old are you?  You will be.  You will be.  I think 26  is kind of young 
[02:59:00]  these days  to get married,  especially for a guy,  I think.  Yeah.  Because I know,  I guess,  because I know guys,  I don't know  what women think,  but.  Crazy.  26 seems very young  to get married.  Don't.  But people do it  and it works.  Here's my advice,  not to the people  that are getting married  because they are  like either brainwashed  or hypnotized  or whatever the fuck.  And sometimes  it's actually,  you know,  it's good  that they get married.  But a lot of times  I put the responsibility  on the family 
[02:59:30]  and friends  of guys  that are going to  marry pieces of shit.  Right.  They have to come forward.  It's the most difficult  thing to do  to say that perhaps  you're not ready  to be married.  Point things out  without being  like rude  or stupid.  but sometimes  a friend,  a good friend  has to step in  or a brother  has to step in.  I wish  I would have  stepped in  to my brother  and told him  I didn't think  he should get married  and vice versa.  I wish  my brother 
[03:00:00]  would have told me  what are you  out of your fucking mind?  You know,  it just,  you know,  but you also  don't want to hear it.  Yeah.  So it's really  got to be spelt out.  I don't know.  A couple things  for you, Steve.  Don't let anyone  pressure you  into getting engaged  first of all.  And second of all,  you can hold them  off by,  you know,  buying them  nice things.  I was in a relationship  where...  Like a cabrio?  Oh, man.  It's like flashing  a shiny thing.  And, you know, 
[03:00:30]  everyone's asking  about an engagement  and then you buy  something nice  and then she forgets  about it for a while.  Yeah, there you go.  In my case,  the gifts started  getting bigger  and bigger and bigger  and then I ran out  of gift ideas  and then it was  pretty obvious  to move on.  It's time to move along.  After...  I actually bought  a car to get out  of getting engaged  and then a Greek cruise.  Oh, they're calling it now?  Up the old dirt canal.  Yeah, exactly.  A Greek cruise 
[03:01:00]  and then when I got back...  When I got back from that...  I don't know.  Maybe a month later  it was done.  Because I ran out of...  I ran out of things  I could do.  You're...  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  You know.  Steve, you know.  When you want to get married,  you just know.  Don't listen to anyone's horse shit.  That'll fuck you up for life.  Yeah, if you want to get married,  you'll get married  if you don't get married.  Exactly.  Don't get pressured  into asking  just because everyone around you  is asking you  when you're going to do it.  I think that's why  so many people split up  because they just do it  for the wrong reason.  Right.  It's like if you don't want to do it,  then you shouldn't. 
[03:01:30]  I wouldn't get married  more so than  Quint wouldn't put on  a life jacket again.  That is how adamant I am  about never getting married again.  If so, it happened to Quint  and that's what happened  to you in the divorce.  He walked away  with more than I did.  Yes, that's true.  He was only in half his stomach.  Well, we got...  Oh, we just lost  Jerry and Ann from Vegas.  A couple wanted to  convince you  that love is real.  Uh-huh.  They just talked about 
[03:02:00]  as I was going over.  I would have loved to have heard it.  I hope that car hit a pole.  And we're on to heaven together.  Let's go to Birdman.  Birdman, what's up?  What's happening, fellas?  Anthony, everybody  is just jealous of you, brother.  Oh, sure.  I've been married  to the same fucking twat  14, 15 years.  You know, but I got a good one, though.  At least if you don't bother  me to break my balls.  I give her plenty of money.  But everybody's just jealous  of you, buddy.  That's what I'm telling you, buddy.  I'm going to break my balls.  This guy's great. 
[03:02:30]  When am I going to come  and see you guys?  Whenever you want, Birdman.  I gave the guy my information.  He won't even have a call me or nothing.  You come in whenever you want.  Come in tomorrow.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  You know who had  the perfect marriage?  Yeah.  Hitler and Ava.  Sonny von Bülow.  Sonny von Bülow.  Hitler and Ava.  It was just long enough.  O.J.  Great honeymoon.  That's true.  That's true.  All right, Birdman.  Just show you.  Give me an Xbox. 
[03:03:00]  No.  What?  James in Scotland.  Whoa, Scotland checking in.  Hey.  James.  Hey.  Why is it that we are the ones  who can't seem to find  that are all illusioned  by the love of Anthony?  He's the real thing.  What he really needs to do  is take his propeller hat off,  you motherfucker.  Oh, I got to take my propeller hat off.  Where's this propeller hat?  I actually like one of those.  It seems fun.  I like aviation.  Yeah, people say you look stupid in it, 
[03:03:30]  but I don't think so.  No one looks smart in a propeller hat.  You really can't look like  anything but an idiot.  Yes.  Wouldn't that be scary  if you looked up  and you're about to have surgery  and he's got a propeller hat on  and you're out?  Let's go to John in Arkansas.  Hey.  Good morning, guys.  Hey, John.  I want you to know  that your hate is safe  because the opposite of love  is not hate.  It's indifference.  If you ever broke up  with anybody  and you didn't care, 
[03:04:00]  afterwards,  you probably weren't loved.  But if you got hurt  and you missed them later on,  then you were probably  in love with them  on some level.  Hmm.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You could just kind of...  I don't know.  I think it's a very small percentage  of people that are actually  in love out there.  That's true.  That's where I...  That I'll believe.  I will agree with you  on that point.  Here's Jerry and Ann.  I want to convince Anthony  love is real.  Oh, boy.  Jerry and Ann  in Vegas. 
[03:04:30]  Hey, guys.  It's actually Terry  with a T,  but who gives a shit?  Terry and Ann  in Vegas.  So, I'm with Ann,  my girl here.  We're cruising  through the desert.  And my arm's  being twisted.  No, I'm kidding.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  No.  Hey, look.  Anthony,  I know where you're at.  I've been married twice.  All right?  Hmm.  And the first one  ended up with about  these stitches  in my leg 
[03:05:00]  from a psychotic bitch.  And the second one  ended up costing me  a shit ton of money.  Now, Ann and I  aren't married.  We've been together  five years.  But we're not married  and we're fucking happy.  I think that may be  the key.  Five years of not  being married,  you have no say  in this whole thing.  There's a whole different  animal when you're married.  And five years,  you're still within  a pretty safe range,  especially if you  are very compatible.  Five years, 
[03:05:30]  you're still in the zone.  Some people lose it  after, you know,  a few months.  But things don't have  to change just  because you get married.  But they do.  These guys are married.  You're married.  No.  Terry and Ann  are married.  No.  Exactly.  Honestly.  It's going to affect  her on all my life  insurance policies.  I mean, she'll be  taking care of it.  But there's not  that legal thing.  Yeah, but you can  commit before you  even get married.  There's a legal thing.  There's also this  obligation to family  and friends.  There's no obligation.  You can get divorced 
[03:06:00]  at any moment.  No, I know.  Here's what I'm saying.  There's an obligation  to family and friends  to try to stay together.  It's an embarrassing  thing to get a divorce.  So you will stay together.  No, not anymore.  I'm not saying...  When we were growing up,  when you heard about  a friend of yours  that was divorced,  it was like,  holy fuck.  There's still something there.  You know more people  that are divorced  than married.  Dude, but there's  still something there  where you have  this guilt thing  or this...  What, did it happen  to you after you  got divorced?  Not after. 
[03:06:30]  Before I got divorced,  when I was thinking  about it,  the most dread I had  wasn't the divorce  and everything.  It was that I had to  go to my friends  and family and be like,  oh, yeah,  I'm getting into divorce.  It's embarrassing.  But they all yelled,  thank God.  Well, of course they did.  You were worried  for the wrong reason.  There is something there  that people will stay together  because they're married,  whereas if they were  just dating  or going out  or a couple for years,  they would have broken up  if they weren't married.  Maybe they stayed married  for kids,  but in general, 
[03:07:00]  people can get out  of it pretty easily  and it's not that big  of a deal  like it used to be.  I know,  but I think  in certain cases,  a lot of people  will stay together  just because they're married,  whereas they would have  broken up a lot quicker,  a lot easier  just going out.  Well, they'd probably  stay together,  well, yeah,  because the divorces  will cost them a lot.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like cooling, right?  So that's it.  You might not be  the stigma.  You get like a stigma  or something.  All right,  I don't think  it's the stigma as much. 
[03:07:30]  Not as much.  I think it's,  you might stay married  because of the kids  and you might stay married  because holy fuck,  it's going to cost me  way too much money  to get a divorce.  But to worry about  what people would think  if you got divorced,  I just don't think  that is real anymore.  As much, anyways.  I think it's there.  We started off  as mutual fuck buddies  and that was...  Margaret Cho  is coming in today?  What?  Get her right in.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  It's a different person.  Oh, that's not Margaret.  Margaret! 
[03:08:00]  Cho!  That's not Margaret Cho.  She looks like her.  Is that a bad one  to make fun of?  Why?  You just saw a celebrity.  Nothing wrong with that, buddy.  Is that a bad one?  Why did everyone look away  like that was a bad move?  She also looked like Mr. Fuji.  It's an egg.  Yeah.  What?  What are you saying?  Oh, he's gone.  It's too bad.  He's dead!  I was going to give him  an Xbox and he's gone.  Oh, she is hot. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, well.  That'll happen.  This guy's getting married  and thinks love is real.  John in North Dakota.  Hey, guys.  Hi, John.  Bismarck, North Dakota.  I might be a bit young,  but I've been with the same girl  for about five years.  And I think love...  Love has got to be  a mutual respect  between two people.  You could have a mutual respect  with people at work. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, I respect these guys.  Like, you know,  mutual respect  between you and your boss.  That's not love.  It's got to be a trust  on a level  that you've never had  with somebody else.  You can trust  a business associate.  All of these things  are just other...  It doesn't define love.  Love is this weird  feeling thing,  and again,  when you're at the beginning  of a relationship,  that, to me,  is what it's supposed  to feel like.  Well, that's lust,  and then that...  There's a lot of lust  in there.  That lust can certainly 
[03:09:30]  turn into love.  Hmm.  Which isn't a bad thing.  I don't know what it is.  Would you trust  a business associate  with every deep, dark secret  that you can possibly  trust somebody  that you want to be  with the rest of your life?  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  A lot of people  don't even trust  their marriage partner  with deep, dark secrets.  A lot of people  keep shit to themselves.  Yeah.  Even when they are married.  I don't think  there's this all, like,  exposing thing  that people do,  and, you know,  here's what happened to me.  I had one 
[03:10:00]  that I never told  any girl  because I was too ashamed.  What's that, Jim?  When I was very young,  and I'm embarrassed  to say this.  Of course you are.  But,  I stole jam.  How'd that work out?  I took the jam,  and I sat in the corner  and I ate it.  So embarrassing.  We had no jam.  Wow.  My mother was having  friends over  for a jam party.  They were all  going to eat jam.  Had no jam. 
[03:10:30]  No, that's what she called it.  But it would be  somebody opened up  a bag with a bunch  of odd-looking toys  in it that made  vibrating noises.  Oh, jam was a verb.  Yeah.  Okay.  Some kind of jelly.  I forget what it was called,  but I ate it.  It was terrible.  Jesus.  Yes, sir.  Hello.  That's it.  Before I want to go,  I would like to say,  hey, thanks, Anthony,  for all the right opinions 
[03:11:00]  on the gun antics.  I love it.  Thank you, sir.  You love your guns?  Just, uh,  oh, I do more.  I love your guns.  I adore my guns.  Let's say hi,  but then again,  you can't have just one.  No, that's true.  I cheat on my guns  with other guns.  Let's say hi to Angelo.  First chick.  We got a chick.  Angelo.  Westchester.  Angelo.  Yeah, hey.  Hi, good morning.  Oh, well, it's Angelo.  I thought we had a chick filing. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, no, Angelo.  Not one woman  has called in  for this conversation.  Angelo, my paisan.  What's up, Angelo?  They have a different mindset.  First and foremost,  I cannot agree with Anthony more.  And I,  and the typical  got married at age 24,  have now been married 20 years.  Ooh.  Got a kid, you know.  But I agree with Anthony  in that,  at the beginning,  it's all about lust  and trying to get down  into the girl's pants.  And then you get comfortable enough 
[03:12:00]  where you want to spend more time  getting down into their pants.  And then you've got to kind of turn.  And eventually that,  and this is where I was,  the second point was,  that lust or that passion,  that's the word I think  everybody's looking for,  is that passion starts to wane.  And then you become more comfortable  with,  without having to want to change.  You know,  natural tendency for people  is that they want to,  they want to bond with people.  And eventually you bond  with one individual  that you want to spend  the rest of your life with 
[03:12:30]  or whatever.  But I agree with Anthony,  you know,  at one point  or at some point  you end up being  so comfortable  and so ingrained in your,  in your routine  that any change to that  would be more devastating  than,  you know,  trot along.  But I think the issue here  is passion.  Most people confuse love  with passion.  Passion.  Enough of that word.  I hate that word now.  Nobody's right.  There's not enough.  Passion.  But it's the passion  that makes you alive. 
[03:13:00]  What's that passion?  We've been saying that  we were just using  the word lost.  Yeah.  Passion.  Maybe it's a mixture  of all the stuff.  Maybe love is like  this big moulange  of everything like that.  A little lust,  a little fucking familiarity,  some common ground  as far as your interests go.  You know,  just shit like that.  And all that put together  is defined as love.  It's not some kind of a  magical thing  that,  you know,  connects to people. 
[03:13:30]  It's a bunch of stuff.  Maybe that's it.  You'll find it more,  I'm sorry,  you'll find it more  with women  where they don't,  they don't,  they want to keep  that passion alive.  Whereas men...  Oh, my God.  I am never even going to  look at a passion fruit  after this call.  Sir, do you have a best girl?  Do I have a best girl?  Yeah.  Except for the ones  I see on the internet?  No.  I say that when you're  out with a girl,  part of it is you just  want to get down  to the nitty-gritty. 
[03:14:00]  The nitty-gritty.  You don't like that?  No.  All right,  Angela,  we got to go.  Thank you.  Jesus.  We got to say hi  to Chris in Indiana.  Chris.  Hey to Chris.  Hey, guys.  Absolutely love your show,  man.  It's been listening  for a long time.  Of course.  I agree.  There's nothing else  to listen to.  Let's be honest  with each other out there.  What else is there  in Indianapolis?  It's not even  that impressive anymore.  There was a time  that was impressive  when we actually  had real competition.  Now there's absolutely  nothing else 
[03:14:30]  to listen to.  Go ahead, Chris.  Oh, anyway.  Sorry.  Well, I think  the whole divorce thing  that he's talking about  is admitting failure.  Whether you know  it's right or wrong  to be married  to that person.  When you divorce,  you're admitting failed.  Yes.  It is a failure.  You're right.  You must admit  to failure.  See you, guys.  It's so much easier  to go to your friends  and family and stuff  and go like,  oh, yeah, yeah,  we broke up. 
[03:15:00]  It's like, wow,  you've been together  so long.  Yeah, well,  things weren't going  well, we broke up.  Instead of going like,  yeah, I'm going  to get a divorce.  Whoa, whoa,  what happened?  Whoa, you think about this?  Did you think this over?  Don't you know  a lot of people  that are divorced?  Yes, but that doesn't mean  that that...  And they still go through  that, you think?  That doesn't mean that much?  I think they do.  Wow.  I think they do.  I think it's more comfortable  when you know  there's so many other people  around you that are divorced.  I think when it's you,  you're still going like,  oh, man, I'm a flop. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, go tell your family  that, you know,  so-and-so or which-and-what  kicked me to the curb.  Yeah.  Maybe I'm just lucky in cards.  Oh, wait a minute.  I think I am.  Holy shit.  I'm lucky in love.  Lucky in cards.  You are one.  I am a card.  Well, look who's talking.  The Joker.  Uh-huh.  Well, you're the ace of diamonds,  clubs, and hearts,  and you're certainly not the last.  Three out of four, I'm bad. 
[03:16:00]  Well, speaking of lust...  Ah!  Sam.  ...leads to our last story today.  Sam.  You had a little sex romp.  I did.  On a boat?  Oh, yes.  At LaGuardia Airport.  Love Boat Skipper is docked  is the headline.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  Get it?  Skipper, I get it.  Oh, hey, hey, little buddy.  Dumb show that was.  Exactly.  You know, teabagging Mrs. Howell.  She hated it. 
[03:16:30]  Because Skipper's asshole smelled.  That old bat.  They're calling it the bruise cruise.  Why?  Craig Gallo leaves central booking  with his girlfriend Monday.  Whoops.  That's a weird name for a girl.  That's so stupid.  After he wrecked his boat  while allegedly engaged in a three-way  with two other people. 
[03:17:00]  Oh.  Ooh.  The story starts off, I mean,  get your laughing hats on  because this one's going to be terrific.  Uh-huh.  He went from King of Beers  to Captain Crunch.  Huh?  Huh?  That's the first line.  What happened?  The kinky captain who drunkenly  crashed his love boat  at LaGuardia Airport.  How the fuck do you do that?  How do you crash into an airport?  I'll tell you how you do it  because you stop paying attention  because there's two mouths on your hog. 
[03:17:30]  That's how much guys love threesomes.  Here's what's happened.  He crashed into an airport.  He had two mouths on his hog  and he was steering the boat  and then he felt his cheeks separate  and a wet fingers.  Oh.  Uh.  Wow.  He won't be taking  any other pleasure cruises  anytime soon.  Can they just fit in more?  He's been banned from driving  on the water as well  as on land.  Oh.  So if you get a B-Wee  that counts as like a D-Wee  for your license?  Are they called B-Wees?  That shouldn't be. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah,  boulding wall and translocated.  If you get one of those  you can't drive?  I guess.  That's fucked up.  That doesn't make any sense.  Well,  they probably figure that  it's good for the goose  is good for the gander.  Reading along here,  they took both licenses.  Wow.  What about his license to kill?  Whoa.  Whoa.  How do you lose that one?  And then he's pissed off.  He goes,  the officer told me  it was just going to be  my boat license.  He said in court.  No,  both,  the judge replied. 
[03:18:30]  Judge is not happy.  You've got to fucking appeal that one.  That's kind of fucking,  and one doesn't have anything  to do with the other.  Right.  I would think.  See,  the story goes,  man was fooling around  with a pal  and a woman  they had just met.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Was this a guy  and a girl  threesome?  Yeah,  they probably pulled a train on her.  Two guys?  You make it sound like  it's great.  I've done that.  Here we go again.  No,  I know.  We've talked about this in the past.  With a bunch of my friends.  And a million guys 
[03:19:00]  would call and go.  It's nothing wrong with it,  but.  Yeah.  Two guys and a girl.  If those boats are rocking,  my ass has a cock in.  Even if they're not at those.  Yeah.  Oh,  I got it.  It's just boats.  Because he's with a guy.  Yeah.  The Portly Andover,  New Jersey man,  was fooling around  with a pal  and a woman.  Pretty cool,  huh?  Yeah,  but you don't want it  to say in the paper  you were fooling around  with a pal.  A pal.  And a woman.  Right.  Does that have to be important?  You would want it to read 
[03:19:30]  him and his pal  were fooling around  with a woman.  No.  Fooling around  with a pal  and a woman.  Fooling around  with a pal  and a woman.  Wow.  Like the end  and a woman  is an afterthought.  Damn.  Yeah.  They had just met  when his 28-foot  well-craft fishing boat  crashed around  midnight Sunday  into a runway.  He crashed  into a runway?  Into runway  approach lights.  Okay.  Oh.  It's right at the beginning  of that runway  at LaGuardia.  Damn.  I didn't realize  it was that close  to the water. 
[03:20:00]  I knew it was close  but damn.  Look at that.  Lucky he wasn't killed.  Oh man.  The minute he was drinking  I was driving  I had a few beers.  Was he wearing  his butt pirate hat?  See?  He reeked the booze.  Gallo was arrested  in 1999  for urinating  in public.  I love how  they bring those out.  And he refused  the breathalyzer test.  Not with his friend  there.  His pal.  He's got to go 
[03:20:30]  to alcohol  and drug abuse  assessment.  He and friend  James  been in NATO  I guess  60  were boozing  it up  from 9pm  to 1130  at a tiki bar  at the Arrow  Yacht Club  in College Point  when they picked  up Mary Ann.  Mary Ann.  Interesting.  Yep.  Wow.  So there are two guys  He's two guys  Let's just get  some fucking broad  Both Gallo  and Balsam  59 
[03:21:00]  Who's Balsam now?  Alright that's the broad  So this guy  Gallo and Balsam  suffered facial injuries  Uh oh  Were they both  going down  and the other guy  Why did they  Yeah what happened  Why did only two  out of the three  get facial injuries  Oh man  Balls had to be  pried from  his mouth  What the fuck  Yikes  Yeah and the other  dude wasn't hurt  Hmm  Photos taken after  showed a dozen  or so Budweiser 
[03:21:30]  beer cans  overflowing a bucket  Budweiser's  and scattered  about the boat  I got it  with sheets  and clothing  strewn  about its cabin  Hmm  So  He must have  uh  you know  drifted off course  a little bit  Yeah  And he's got a  girlfriend by the way  Whoops  He was in court  with his girlfriend  He had a girlfriend  She don't look  none too happy  walking in front  of him there  Oh is that the  girlfriend  or the other girl  I wouldn't think  he'd be walking 
[03:22:00]  out with the  other girl  Right  Probably his chick  and all pissed  off at him  Got it  I don't know  honey  I was hammered  It wasn't me  It was that  my pal  I had some  of that passion  He picked it up  He picked her up  I you know  I was trying to  turn away from  the runway lights  I'm not going to  go the next thing  I know  James is down  there with her  Well that's  not sexy  at all  that story  Steve the therapist  wants to comment  about your  relationship issues  Yes

[03:24:00]  in any  dysfunctional  family  don't talk  don't trust  don't feel  and one  could easily  make the  argument  that you  have a  limited  capacity  or ability  to make  yourself  vulnerable  emotionally  Is that a  fair statement?  No  I make  myself  available  emotionally  a lot  but only  not like  publicly  like  like  I've 
[03:24:30]  been  very  open  with  people  you  know  Well I  mean  with  one  woman  Of course  Let's  take a  vote of  everybody  else  in the  room  there  How many  people  agree  with  what  Ann  is  saying  What  I  tapped  out  a while  ago  That he  makes  himself  emotionally  vulnerable  to  women  I do  though  I've  been  the  sap  in  many  a  relationship  You've  put  yourself  out  there  I put  myself  out  there  I've  laid it  all on  the line  Any
