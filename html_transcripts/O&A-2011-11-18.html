<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a heated debate about Tim Tebow’s performance for the New York Jets, his religiosity, and speculation about his sexuality, fueled by crude humor and homophobic jokes.  Callers weighed in, and pictures of a rumored girlfriend were shown and discussed.  The conversation transitioned to a detailed recounting of their recent Thanksgiving-themed live stage production, featuring Jimmy Norton, Chip, Uncle Paul, E-Rock (as a turkey), Rich Voss, and Bobo.  Pat Duffy’s onstage consumption of a vomit-mashed potato concoction, causing Bob Kelly to flee, was a highlight.  The hosts discussed audience reaction, technical aspects of the multi-camera production, and plans for future shows in other cities.  A karaoke singer named Jordan, who performed at the event, was described as obnoxious and angry.

The show then focused on professional wrestling, ranking the best "mic workers," including Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Ric Flair, Shawn Michaels, Macho Man Randy Savage, Mick Foley, and the Shockmaster.  They debated the "total package" of wrestlers, comparing Hogan’s physicality to Foley’s versatility.  A CM Punk wrestling promo was played, showcasing Punk’s scathing criticism of the McMahon family and his impending departure from the WWE, hinting at joining other promotions.  The hosts discussed heel vs. babyface characters and audience reactions to heel turns, using Austin and Punk as examples.

The conversation abruptly shifted to the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, referencing South Park’s satire and making numerous jokes.  They criticized the media’s handling of the Mike McQuarrie interview, focusing on sensationalism over substance, and discussed McQuarrie’s continued association with Sandusky after witnessing the abuse.  This led to a discussion of the developing Syracuse University child molestation scandal involving assistant basketball coach Bernie Fine, including graphic details of the alleged abuse and further jokes. Mike Francesa then called in, giving NFL picks, sharing self-deprecating humor, a near-miss "Saturday Night Fever" story, and impersonations, interspersed with the hosts' interactions.  Upcoming guests CM Punk, Brian Regan, and Eliza Schlesinger were announced.

CM Punk's interview followed, covering his career, return from burnout and injuries, intense travel schedule (including Mexico and Iraq), wrestling style, memorable moments (both positive and negative, including physical altercations with fans), favorite wrestlers, and relationship with Vince McMahon.  The interview concluded with promotion of Punk's Survivor Series match.  Brian Regan then joined in studio, discussing his appearance on David Letterman (and being bumped by Herman Cain), promoting his new CD and merchandise, joking about his divorce and dating life, and a potentially controversial t-shirt design for his online show.

Brian Regan continued into the next segment, recounting a humorous anecdote about a large t-shirt order. Eliza Schlesinger was introduced, with suggestive comments from the hosts. She discussed her upcoming Jimmy Fallon appearance, contrasting it with being bumped from Letterman by Herman Cain, and the conversation turned sexually suggestive, including detailed descriptions of alleged harassment by Cain and explicit jokes. Regan’s "Last Comic Standing" win was criticized, followed by a discussion of Schlesinger's experiences as a female comedian, including unwanted advances and logistical challenges while traveling. A story about a fart by a sound technician named Kenny derailed the conversation briefly, before returning to Schlesinger's career, experiences as a female comedian on the road, and preparation for her Jimmy Fallon appearance.  The show concluded with plugs for the comedians' appearances, brief discussion of JFK's assassination and Dealey Plaza, and promotion of Schlesinger's show "Excused."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, morning everyone.  Hello.  Hi, fuckers. It's Friday.  How's everybody done on this Friday?  Tired, brother.  You're tired? Everyone's a little sleepy.  I like that. I slept like 12. This to me is very early.  Yeah.  I'm tired.  Yeah, we're all good.  How about we say that today? We're all good.  I'm afraid I get dementia. I don't sleep enough.  All people that haven't slept enough, that's how you get dementia.  Oh, I saw that on the news. 
[00:00:30]  You did, right?  Yeah.  People, you have dementia? Find out and then forget about it.  Yeah, exactly. How about you do the story right away?  Because I might have this thing and I'm not going to remember past the commercials.  That's really funny.  Yeah, if you don't get enough sleep or something.  Oh, shit, man.  Just because it's fresh in my mind, if you would humor me for a moment, please, Anthony.  Yes.  The fucking Jets lost to Jesus last night and I am not happy about it.  Whoopsie.  Hey, the Jets lost to the Broncos last night. 
[00:01:00]  Jets Nation fully expected an easy victory last night.  And fucking Tim, Jesus, Tebow beat the Jets.  Single-handedly.  Single-handedly, yes.  The end of the game.  A mile-high miracle to call it.  There is a Tebow dance, you know, they're doing in clubs now.  Really?  Yeah, Artie Foucault told me that there's a thing where people will just all of a sudden,  they do this, it's a weird kneel and pray.  Yeah.  He said they'll just stop and go like.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what it is. 
[00:01:30]  It's a Tebow dance.  The Tebow.  They asked, we're going to get into this for a second here, because they asked Tebow why  the media hates him.  And he's like, but the reason is because of what you just did for us.  At the end of this long drive last night, he went down for the big, I gotta pray to Jesus.  It's called Tebowing, and if you look on YouTube, there's plenty of Tebowing going on.  But that's why people hate him, because you're in the middle of a game, you know, fine, you're  into the Jesus, that's fine.  Yeah.  But how about you celebrate the fact that you did just score a touchdown first, maybe 
[00:02:00]  acknowledge your teammates, and then do the Jesus kneeling thing.  Nah, Jesus is a top priority.  You think?  You gotta kneel to Jesus.  It's showboaty.  It's showboaty.  Showboaty.  But there's something phony about a guy, or annoying about a guy, who needs to publicly  show how much he likes Jesus in the middle of the field.  I don't, I don't, I think this is a rare case where it's not showboaty.  No, I believe him.  This is how much this guy loves Jesus.  Jesus.  I believe him.  I still think it's annoying, though.  Yeah, but here's the deal, so, Jets are up, you got six minutes left, Broncos got the 
[00:02:30]  ball on their own five-yard line, like, okay, the Jets should have fucking beat the shit  out of them, but alright, we're gonna get a close victory here.  Just gotta hold him.  Tebow marches down the field 95 yards, 92 of those yards are his.  Yeah.  And they win the fucking game 17-13 last night.  You ever see footprints on the field?  No.  Yeah, see, Tebow says, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why, during the toughest plays, are there only 
[00:03:00]  one set of cleat prints on the field?  And Jesus says, oh, Tebow, that's when I was blocking you.  Oh, you're killing me.  I was blocking for you, and you were walking in my footsteps.  You're killing me.  And he actually had Jesus blocking for him.  And Jesus, believe me, not a big guy, very skinny body and everything like that, and wearing  sandals.  But he can throw a block like no one's business. 
[00:03:30]  Can't a defensive end fucking step on Jesus' toes?  Try it.  If he's got the sandals on.  Try it.  To fuck it up a little bit.  You try it, dude, because it's impossible.  Jesus can block for anyone.  I have to go with the Jets are that bad.  Because you know Tebow's going to run just about every fucking time, and you can't stop  him?  No.  That means there's a problem with the defense. 
[00:04:00]  I'm sorry.  You've got to get through the Lord first.  How do you break through the Lord?  Dude, you've got a quarterback marching down the field 92 out of the 95 yards.  Guess what, Jets?  He's going to run again.  Figure it out.  And Jesus never gets a flag thrown on him.  Never.  Nope.  Never, never, never.  Penalty down the field for too much inherent goodness.  So now the Jets season is almost fucked.  We're 5-5. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  By the way, this is why it's annoying when a guy like this deals and has to make a move  of Jesus, unless he does it after every play, or does it after he throws an interception.  Because do you really think, that's implying that Christ wanted you to take the ball and  put it into the end zone.  I don't think Christ gives a fuck.  No, Jesus does for Tebow.  Yeah, but he's the only sports figure that actually Jesus is rooting for.  Well, guess what, Tim Tebow?  There's some Jets that love the Jesus too.  So what?  You're basically showing the whole country that Jesus thinks you're more special than 
[00:05:00]  anyone else.  I don't see the Jets genuflecting in the middle of the fucking field.  Well, they're showing a little respect for Jesus.  Not as much as Tim Tebow.  It was fucking really, really frustrating last night.  Tebow.  It was supposed to be an easy victory.  And then they talked to Tebow after the game.  You want to hear this clip real fast?  What'd he say?  And he's still a virgin, huh?  Look.  Look.  Oh, yeah.  Look.  Problem. 
[00:05:30]  Look.  Did he come out of Penn State?  No.  Oh, just wondering.  We'll get into the Penn State and Syracuse situation in a few minutes.  I'm warning you.  Tebow's still a virgin.  He's a good looking guy.  He's an athlete.  But he's a small dick.  His arms are as big as my fucking thighs.  How is he still a virgin?  That's all I'm saying.  Girls throwing themselves at him?  They absolutely have to.  He knows, though.  He's saving himself from marriage like Jesus would want.  Are you allowed to finger pop if you're into Jesus?  I don't know how Jesus feels about finger popping. 
[00:06:00]  I'm a little confused with what Jesus allows.  I think he's confused, too.  Yeah.  Who?  Tebow?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Oh, you think it might be?  Yeah, you know, you don't want to be the guy that says it.  Everyone's thinking it.  Something's going on with the Tebow.  He might possibly be saving himself for marriage, but deep down, maybe he's thinking about cock.  Maybe.  Could be.  Maybe.  It's a guess.  But he's the type of Jesus guy that, you know, really reads the Bible. 
[00:06:30]  And the Bible, some say.  Turn it off.  It's that type of thing.  So there might be some confusion there.  The Bible says a man shouldn't lay with another man.  Queer funny, not ha-ha funny.  Not ha-ha.  Queer funny.  Because he's all in with the Jesus.  But there might be some funny feelings that go against the teachings.  Like, he doesn't get mad when he gets sacked, and he says, don't pull them off that fast.  Yeah.  Stop.  Slow down.  I like to pile off. 
[00:07:00]  You have five giant defensive ends.  And I'll tell you right now, we're not saying it on this show.  Yes.  But the voice is very suspicious, too.  Oh, no.  I haven't heard him talk.  And that doesn't mean.  Right.  Doesn't mean.  But in a lot of cases, it does mean.  It's been our experience, right, Ant?  Jimmy?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  That voice.  Queer's breath.  Queer's breath.  Queer's voice.  They talked to him after the game after he beat the shit out of the Jets single-handedly  to win 17-13 last night.  Right.  And here's Tebow after the game. 
[00:07:30]  What comes over you with five minutes to go?  Well, you know, first and foremost, you know, I got to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,  and thank my teammates.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Boy.  There you go.  You a virgin in the front and in the back?  Oh, boy.  Wow.  No fucking way.  You didn't know this.  No, I didn't.  You don't know this.  No, I didn't.  I want to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  That Tebowing is a cry for help. 
[00:08:00]  That prayer has nothing to do with the last play.  No.  That is a prayer for please, please help me.  You think there's some torment there?  Oh, a little torment.  He believes in the teachings of Jesus, but that goal line is just a metaphor, my friend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's trying to reach a place that is good and Jesus loves it.  And yeah, that's that's.  So and we're and we're and we're and we're fans of the gays.  We're not trying to say anything crazy here, but we're looking at a guy that might be tormented. 
[00:08:30]  That's all.  Oh, my God.  That's all we're saying.  Yeah.  We like gay people.  Absolutely.  We don't have a nine cock.  No, we love the cock.  Well, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, let's hear a little more of him.  All right.  I said thank my teammates because those guys believed in me and stuck with me and we stuck  with each other for 60 minutes.  I'm extremely blessed.  You know, God has blessed me with so many people that support me. 
[00:09:00]  You know, a great family that supports me.  Great teammates and a great coaching staff.  And that's what I'm focused on.  Do you feel like it's your throwing motion?  It's your faith.  What is it that provokes anger or hatred or disdain from some journalists and publicists?  Well, you know, I'm not sure.  But, you know, something I learned early in college was to not worry about what I can't  control.  And that's something that I can't control.  But what I can't control is my attitude, my effort, my focus every single day.  My sexuality.  And that's what I'm trying to worry about. 
[00:09:30]  Another thing I can't control is when that little fella jumps up when I'm watching television.  When it twitches.  When I'm in the shower and all of a sudden he jumps up.  I'm like, he must need more cold water and a good punch.  Oh, boy.  Oh, brother.  But, I mean, there's a lot of Tebow fans out there.  We got one on the line right now from Lafayette.  What do you got, sir?  Hey, what's up?  Y'all need to bring up a picture of some Tebow girlfriend.  She's real, real attractive.  And he's not having sex with her.  So he might be gay.  Well, that's what I'm thinking.  You don't know. 
[00:10:00]  We don't know.  We're not going to say that shit.  We're just suspicious.  That's all.  I would guess.  I'll take a guess.  He sounds like a gay guy to me.  But that doesn't mean anything.  It might just be the way he talks.  Right.  But typically, I have always associated that voice with a certain type of guy.  Does that mean he's gay?  No, of course not.  I've never met him.  You sound like that.  Is that his girlfriend in a bikini?  No, it's not her.  What?  It was rumored to be his girlfriend, but it's not.  Of course it's not.  No.  Does he have a girlfriend?  He may, but that wonderful woman is not. 
[00:10:30]  Look, now I'm even more suspicious.  Go to the bikini picture.  If people are saying this is your girlfriend.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a little over the top.  What if you go, yep, that's my girlfriend, all right?  And it's so over the top.  And why wouldn't you just go for it?  This is my girlfriend.  We've been seeing each other for years.  But we are virgins.  We're looking at a girl in a brown bikini that's very ample in the water.  The girl is smoking.  But that's not his girlfriend.  Holy fuck.  That's not his girlfriend, though, Travis? 
[00:11:00]  No, they just took a picture together once.  Yeah.  Did you watch the game last night, Travis?  Football tits.  Oh, no, you were at the...  No, I didn't watch the game last night.  Yeah, you were watching your Canadians lose to my Islanders, even though I'm sort of not in this year.  Um, Tebow had 109 yards passing him.  Yes.  Holy mother of God.  That's her naked?  Holy fuck.  Is that the same girl?  Holy fuck.  Why wouldn't you say, yes, that's my girlfriend?  They're giant tits. 
[00:11:30]  They are giant.  And they're natural looking.  They look natural.  You know why they're...  Ka-chunk, ka-chunk, ka-chunk.  You can tell they're natural because she's putting her hands over her head.  Right, she's doing the hands over her head thing.  But it looks like she doesn't really need to do that, but just in case, they move a little south.  Tim, could you fuck me?  Oh my God.  Tim, Jesus doesn't want me to right now.  If we get married, then that's fine, but not now.  Tim, just...  Then just do it in my asshole. 
[00:12:00]  If I'm Tim Tebow and that walks in naked, I would yell as loud as I can, fuck Jesus.  Jesus flies out the window.  Get the fuck over here, right?  A la Akbar.  Right.  I would throw my Bible out the window.  Yeah.  Or prop her ass up with it.  She's totally built for titty fucking.  Jesus.  I mean...  Jesus.  They don't like when we say the Jesus name.  Jesus made her.  We got God-loving people out there listening to us as well. 
[00:12:30]  Wow.  Yeah, who is this girl?  Lucy Pinder.  Yeah, she's just a model.  But did she have any connection with Tebow?  Like I said, there was a quick rumor on the internet two years ago.  That was squashed immediately.  Was the rumor started by maybe some people behind the scenes?  They'd like to do that too.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Oh, is that true?  His new girlfriend lives in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada?  Little longer.  No, but he only had nine completions, Ant. 
[00:13:00]  Do you understand in football how bad that is?  Yeah.  He only threw for 109 yards.  And let me tell you another thing.  His first play of the game, he decided, I'm going to throw the ball because no one's expecting it.  And it was a completed pass for 27 yards.  So for the rest of the game, if you're following me here, 82 yards passing.  Wow.  82 yards passing.  Yeah.  And he beats the Jets.  Beat the Jets anyway.  And now he's 4-1 as a starter. 
[00:13:30]  A quarterback that can't really throw the ball.  Well, quarterbacks really don't need to throw the ball.  That forward pass is overrated.  Do it old school.  Ah, where's the lateral?  He did a shuffle pass.  Yeah, we should do the lateral.  He did one of those shuffle pass things.  That weird sidearm.  I'm running, but no, I'm not.  Here you go.  Pass.  Oh, my God.  Yep.  It's Lucy Pinder.  Fucking A. 
[00:14:00]  That's a, that's a.  Oh, look at those udders hanging.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Now she's just teasing the entire internet.  Now she's totally naked.  She's just teasing the entire internet with that picture.  Are they fake, though?  Are you kidding me?  I don't know.  What do you think?  They look almost.  They look real-ish.  I don't see any, like, bumpy things.  You don't see the bag marks.  Oh, the side marks, right?  Yeah.  No bag marks and no irregular shapes.  She's completely naked on all fours, arching her back down toward the floor.  I swear to God, her tits, if you turn that upside down, look like the top of the Capitol. 
[00:14:30]  Doesn't it?  Yeah.  It's the Capitol building.  Capitol tits.  Yes.  Why doesn't she act like a lady?  I know.  Whore.  Get married already.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Guess what Christ wants you to do.  Have something that's legally binding with the state.  That's what Christ cares about.  Yes.  Jesus cares about.  Legal matrimony.  Red tape.  Yeah.  And the lawyer's fees.  Yeah.  JJ has a good observation.  Hey!  JJ!  About what we're talking about.  JJ.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, I was just wondering if Obie is perhaps suggesting that Tim 
[00:15:00]  Tebow is so good at running the ball because he's running from some issues in his own  head.  Ah, you think something's chasing him, let's say.  Look, I have no idea about Tebow.  Could be running from something.  But there's a...  Yeah, it could happen.  Oh, John.  All right, fine.  John in Gainesville.  Go ahead, John. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, listen.  We had Tebow here at Florida for four years.  Gators.  But the kid is for real, man.  He's for real.  You got to believe in Tebow.  He wants it to happen.  It's going to happen.  Oh, boy.  This guy's a real Tebow fan.  Wait until he loses.  I believe he's not fronting.  He's just doing what he thinks is proper and all that.  You're probably right.  But it's still annoying to watch.  But it annoys a lot of people.  He's not fronting.  He's rearing.  Hey, guys.  Hey, I understand that.  But I'm telling you, you know, this kid is for real.  He's a Gator.  He's always... 
[00:16:00]  Look at this guy.  He's a good guy, man.  Loves Tebow.  You're probably right.  You ever sleep in a tree fort with him?  Jesus.  You know what, though?  Man, they fucking love their Tebow down there in Gator country.  He probably is a good kid.  He probably is a nice guy and genuinely nice.  And he probably is sincere.  How many titles...  Oh, sorry, Jimmy.  I just hate that...  Any display publicly of God-loving, I fucking hate.  To me, it should be private.  You don't need to show it off like it's a fucking ring.  Yeah, because there's guys on the other side that believe in the Jesus.  That's why I never understood that shit. 
[00:16:30]  Hey, John, how many national titles did Tebow give you?  Two or three?  He gave us two.  Two.  Okay.  Two fucking national titles Tebow gave the Gators.  Tebow and Jesus.  And Jesus.  And he had a Heisman, you know, as a softball.  But, Jimmy, I hear what you're saying, man.  But, you know, the guy does believe.  He's not making it up.  He does believe.  I think you're probably right.  I believe all that.  Yeah, I believe that he does.  I shouldn't have said before.  The idea that he's usually fraudulent to me, but there are guys that are sincere.  But I wouldn't like it if he was Muslim, either.  I wouldn't like it if he was Baptist and running in a circle, doing whatever Baptist ministers do. 
[00:17:00]  It would all annoy me.  Right.  Appreciate it, guys.  All right, buddy.  Well, he's winning football games.  Yeah.  I mean, the people that know way more than us, they don't think this guy is an NFL quarterback.  He's proven a lot of people wrong.  Four and one as a starter.  You know, it doesn't matter in the end how you win the game, I guess.  He marched down the field single-handedly last night.  The fuck?  What a guy.  Against a team that, you know, we were supposed to have a good defense.  The man, the myth.  So, you asked how I'm doing, and that's the answer. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a little, well, that would get you a little cranky on a Friday morning after  a Thursday game like that.  Five and five.  Thought you had it in the bag.  Then I watched the Islanders, which I'm, you know, they played Travis's Canadians.  Travis owns the team now?  Yeah, pretty much.  Travis's Canadians.  Me and the Mulsons, we went 50-60.  This organization, this Islander organization is in a bad place, man.  I know they won last night, and stupid intern Matt goes, give him a chance.  Will you shut the fuck up? 
[00:18:00]  I've been giving him a chance for so long, I can't even tell you.  You should just give him a chance, he says.  Why do you let him talk to you?  I don't.  I sit there, and all of a sudden he just tries to engage me in conversation.  You pretty much got to tell him, don't, you're not allowed to speak to me.  But then he says stupid shit.  Exactly.  That's just it.  He did clean up puke yesterday.  It's his job.  But I mean, he didn't complain.  True.  True.  But Travis, how many seats were empty last night?  I think it would be easier to count how many seats were filled. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, shit.  Coliseum not packing them in.  I don't want you to exaggerate, because on TV when you're watching, I saw a lot of blue  seats, meaning empty seats.  They needed the money!  But I think they pump in crowd noise at this point.  And of course, the announcers are going to be rah-rah Islanders, so they're going to jack  up the numbers.  So you were there.  It was at least half empty, probably more.  I would say the seats were 40%.  Don't you love when the place is just about empty, and over the PA they play, boom! 
[00:19:00]  Oh, yeah, they were doing that last night.  You could hear an echo.  It's supposed to sound like a bunch of people stomping on the floor, and it's like no one's  stomping this fucking 5,000 people in the place.  Yeah, we got our Capital One box of popcorn and our $9.50 beer at the fucking Islanders game.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah, they don't get it.  No, you'd think you're at Yankee Stadium with the prices that they have.  They should be giving away the place at this point because no one's going to go to the games, you know? 
[00:19:30]  And then what happens is out of the 40% capacity, like Travis is saying, most of them were fucking Canadians fans.  Oh, yeah, I would say.  Oh, yeah.  Well, half of that probably.  Yeah, half of them were from Montreal.  Pops.  So now you're looking at.  And it would have been more if it was a weekend game.  Now you're talking about a minuscule number of actual Islander fans that were at the game last night.  They don't care.  Islanders are done.  We got a shitty, shitty fucking coach that shows no emotion.  He's a softie.  They need a new arena. 
[00:20:00]  Garth Snow needs to fucking go.  And quite frankly, the owner should just sell the team to someone that gives a fuck about hockey.  They do.  They need a new arena.  They need a fire behind him, something new and exciting that's going to bring people in.  But I did see a very rare occurrence in the NHL last night.  Yes.  Rick DiPietro was in goal.  In goal?  Yeah.  Wow.  I heard some guy.  Earning his money, I guess.  One of the great things about the stadium being half full is that you can hear everybody that's yelling no matter where they are. 
[00:20:30]  I like your optimistic take on it.  It's half full.  So DiPietro has a save last night.  And some guy yells, there's another $5 million save for you, DiPietro.  And everyone heard it.  Yes.  And it was funny.  Well, because if you're a true Islander fan, you know there's some weird black cloud over this guy.  Yeah.  And the stupid owner of the Islanders, I know it comes from him and not Garth Snow, says, look, we're paying this guy a shitload of money.  So play him.  So we get our money's worth.  When you got to just fucking sit him and just take the hit. 
[00:21:00]  Sit him for how many years?  Well, who gives a fuck?  Don't play him because you feel like you need to get your money's worth from the guy.  It's affecting the whole chemistry of the goddamn team.  It's obvious.  But he won.  He didn't even start.  No.  Drive for five.  But he won last night.  Yeah.  He ended up getting the win.  Yeah.  Because what's his name went down early.  What a guy.  Really fast, too.  Sanchez sucks a dick because the Jets fans are going to kill me if I don't mention that.  Oh.  He throws a pick in the third quarter for a touchdown. 
[00:21:30]  That made a difference?  Of course it did.  Sanchez fucking throws a pick for six.  Oh, yeah.  Pick six, as they like to say.  And for a third-year quarterback, he's terrible.  He fucking can't throw.  That's great.  It's me.  Great teammates and a great coaching staff.  And that's what I'm focused on.  Do you feel like it's your throwing motion?  It's your faith?  What is it that provokes anger or hatred or disdain from some journalists and publicists? 
[00:22:00]  Well, you know, I'm not sure.  But, you know, something I learned early in college was to not worry about what I can't control.  And that's something that I can't control.  But what I can't control is my attitude, my effort, my focus every single day.  And that's what I'm trying to worry about.  Why do we hate overly nice guys?  Why do we hate them?  Because I think we feel a lot of times they're masking something.  Yeah, it comes off as insincere.  There's something.  I don't think he's lying.  I think that I've met guys like that before who seem like they don't even mean they're fighting it so deep down that that overly niceness is making up for just going, you know, I just think, God, I want to fuck a man. 
[00:22:30]  It just seems like there's something underneath, an ugliness, or something they don't like that it's covering.  I don't mind.  There's plenty of athletes I think are genuinely nice guys.  But it's just a weird vibe we get.  We're intuitive.  The athlete.  He seems to do everything right.  And for some reason, society in general is bothered by that.  Well, there is something. 
[00:23:00]  I'll say this.  It is annoying how they, if he was a Muslim doing that, and not to make it too political, but they wouldn't, journalists would never fucking attack that if he was showing his faith as a Muslim.  Then again, if he was kneeling and facing Mecca, maybe they would.  Yeah.  All right.  I changed my opinion quickly.  So, how are you, Ant?  What's on your mind?  Good.  Good.  Feeling good.  Coming off of yesterday's lab event.  It was a fun event, wasn't it?  That was great.  A lot of fun.  And, yeah, the staff did a great job. 
[00:23:30]  They did an amazing job.  That fucking play was amazing.  Oh, that production was second to none.  And they filmed it with three cameras, so I'm hoping the web team works today and gets that up on their website immediately.  Yeah.  You know what I say?  It should be on the SiriusXM site, hopefully in the next day or two.  Better than Cats.  Better than Miss Saigon.  Now and forever.  Now and forever at the Winter Garden Theater.  And you know what?  Now we're going to have to do another one next year.  Oh, boy.  Maybe even a Christmas play.  A Christmas spectacle.  These people are expecting one every year now. 
[00:24:00]  They are.  Everyone really, Patty being brought back into the fold, people just loving her, talking  about taking in the shit box.  Balls deep in the shit maker.  Balls deep in our shit maker.  In the shit maker.  That was a great line.  Don't forget that line anytime soon.  That was a Jimmy Norton rewrite.  Yes.  Last minute edition.  That was a rewrite.  Yeah, yeah.  Poor edition.  Sam wrote some very funny stuff.  Yes, yes.  So it was good before, you know, it was very good.  You just bumped it up a little bit, Jimmy?  Oh, just threw in some ideas.  Yeah, some worked, some didn't. 
[00:24:30]  Chip killed, fucking Uncle Paul killed, and fucking did great.  Everyone did great, except for Rich Voss.  And E-Rock as the turkey.  It was amazing.  It was amazing.  When he comes walking out, dressed in that god-awful turkey outfit, the crowd went wild.  But I love E-Rock, you know, he gets beat up a lot by us, obviously, and by the listeners,  but man, that guy is all in.  He was a trooper.  He's always all in.  He got up on that table and laid down like a big fat turkey.  He fucking said, all right, if I gotta do this, I'm gonna fucking go all in. 
[00:25:00]  Yes, he did.  That's what I love about the kid.  I really liked being in the audience when he got on the table, because when he laid down  on the table, the entire audience gasped, thinking that the table would give way.  I was gonna collapse like a wrestling fucking gag.  He was assuming too much.  Yeah.  But it worked.  It held him.  Travis and me both laid down on the table the day before.  To check it out?  To make sure it would withstand.  Together?  Were you holding anvils?  Were you penis to penis?  No.  We were just side to side.  Gary suggested we go one on top of the other. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, well.  What's that about?  Sexy is what it is.  How about, by the way, how about a fucking, it's only November.  A Christmas play.  Oh.  Not here, though.  Somewhere else.  Well.  Why don't we take this debacle.  A Christmas extravaganza.  This abortion.  Somewhere else.  To another city.  Yeah, we need to go to other cities.  That would be good.  We're a national show.  Why not?  There's some other people out there that want to say hi.  Get the sales team to really do something.  Get it sponsored.  Oh, boy.  And go, you know, seriously. 
[00:26:00]  I think we should do that.  Yeah, it's not a bad idea.  It would be fun to do a Christmas play.  A Christmas play.  You know, I want to avoid the Rich Voss phone call.  I said everyone did well except for Rich.  Oh, no, no.  Rich did great.  But Rich was panicking on the stage.  He really was.  Was he?  He couldn't read his script.  Then he had to get his glasses.  That was hilarious.  And then there was an obvious, like, thing in the script where he had to look off into  the distance.  But it was obvious he had to look at Anthony.  And he turned completely the wrong way.  Wrong way.  And started looking at me and Bobby. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  And then he just forgot to say one of his lines.  He was panicking.  I want to.  Maybe we should call him later and see what that was about.  He was losing his mind up there.  I could understand if you're, you know, off book and you forget one of your lines.  Right.  But when we're all holding the scripts in our hands, how do you fuck that up?  Bobo seemed confused as to why he was carried off the stage after you shot him.  He didn't realize he was killed?  Yeah.  To later come back as the spirit of Thanksgiving?  Unfortunately, and I'll take it.  This was my mistake. 
[00:27:00]  Oh.  I had given Bobo a script where he had lines throughout the play.  And so he didn't.  Oh, he was confused.  I had a different script than everyone else.  Yeah.  So he thought he was going to be up there and talk a lot.  He thought he'd be the star of the show.  And I was just boneheaded on my part.  And just to fill in a couple of the blanks here.  At the end of the play, Bobo's supposed to come up and just talk about the spirit of Thanksgiving.  Improv.  Yes, it was great.  I hope people understand out there that the only direction he got was, you know, improv  or talk about, he doesn't know the word improv, but, you know, talk about, you know, the 
[00:27:30]  spirit of Thanksgiving.  And he had 90 seconds notice.  Yeah.  Knowing that he had nothing prepared.  But he was actually not bad.  And he gave a fairly good description of Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  It was like, all right, that was actually a nice ending.  Shithead.  Thanks for nothing.  He was such a douche.  People want Philly.  People want Boston.  And right off the bat.  Yep.  And then we'll figure something out.  Pat fucking Duffy.  Oh, he's the great Pat Duffy. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, my God.  Never disappoints.  That guy is hardcore.  Yeah.  I couldn't believe he did that.  No.  No, I know.  It was such a surprise when all of a sudden he pulled that cup out.  That's crazy.  We had no idea that was going to happen.  No.  Unbelievable.  You got the big fucking bowl of mashed potatoes and puke combined.  All of a sudden we just want him on stage to say hi.  Next thing you know, he pulls a cup out.  That was like, it was perfect.  Oh, that stringy, bile-y stuff that was hanging from the cup and he drank it.  We lost Bob Kelly at this point immediately. 
[00:28:30]  He hid behind the curtains.  Fucking Pat Duffy goes, it was his father's birthday, and he goes, like, I let the proposal  toast, and I didn't see it coming.  I can't watch that.  He takes a cup and he scoops it in the fucking vomit.  The mashed potatoes would vomit in it.  And I could see in the cup, except the potatoes were white.  Don't say it.  The brown floating liquid.  It looked like there was coffee spilled in the fucking potatoes.  Yeah, it looked like coffee spilled.  But it wasn't.  That was like lung butter.  Bile.  Lung butter, yes.  We used to call that lung butter when I was growing up.  Oh, God.  Where it's like that, it has a little blood in it, a little red, a little pinkish. 
[00:29:00]  It's viscous-y, stringy, and almost looks like, it's like a cigarette fucking cough that  comes up.  And fucking Pat Duffy went in three times.  Three fucking times.  That guy had been puking in that fucking thing.  Oh, the whole time.  Could you start it over?  Could you play the volume for this?  Oh, it's terrible.  This is, um.  And Bob Kelly ran away.  He hid behind a curtain.  He had to.  He was going to puke.  And I got a quick video off my cell phone.  It's up on my YouTube channel. 
[00:29:30]  Hopefully, we put it on our Facebook page.  Can we get the volume played?  Yeah, and start it over, Sam.  This is good.  Toast to your dad?  Average.  You need a beverage or?  Wait, he's got to come.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Scooped in the puke.  No, that's the mashed potato puke.  That's the mashed potato puke.  No, that's mashed potato puke.  A toast to your dad?  What?  Oh, shit.  No, no, no. 
[00:30:00]  No.  No.  No, he just took his scoop.  Ah, shit.  Ah, shit.  Ah, shit.  Ah, shit.  Ah, shit.  Ah, shit.  Second scoop?  Second scoop.  No!  For Dad! For Dad!  For Dad! 
[00:30:30]  Third scoop.  Oh my God!  We're watching this live. It's terrible, dude.  Terrible. It's a terrible video.  How the fuck can he do that?  I can't even watch it. 
[00:31:00]  That is just fucking puking.  Crowd goes wild.  Pat fucking Duffy!  Pat fuck...  I almost repeated Pat fucking Duffy.  Bob Kelly fucking hid behind the curtain.  That was well beyond what Bob could have handled.  I couldn't handle it.  Yeah, but we're not puking.  I don't understand the Bob Kelly puke thing.  And so many people really believe it's a work.  Oh no.  They really do though.  And that he's just doing it for the show or something.  He's got some weird fucking weak stomach. 
[00:31:30]  Yesterday we were able to prove it  because he puked into a blue bucket  and we were showing people like,  look, this is...  He really fucking pukes when he sees gross shit.  I think he was forced to lick an open asshole  when he was a kid.  That's my guess.  I showed him a picture of an open asshole.  Yeah, that does it.  And he wasn't expecting it.  He was like...  When he ran into the crowd, yeah.  At the circus who escapes and he's running  fucking in through the...  Oh my God.  What?  Oh, he's jumping off the fucking Burge Tower. 
[00:32:00]  And fucking Bob running through the crowd,  it was real.  He just couldn't handle it.  He knew what to do.  Yeah, he was dry heaving a lot yesterday, but...  I'll fucking just retweet that fucking video  from Pat Duffy for everybody.  Oh my God, dude.  I couldn't believe Duffy did that.  I could...  And then he came up to say hello after  and he smelled like puke.  Yeah.  It was terrible.  Yeah, yeah.  I...  Well, SiriusXM, they...  I couldn't deal.  They filmed all this stuff in HD,  three cameras, so we need some of these clips. 
[00:32:30]  Because I got just shitty cell phone fucking videos.  Oh.  Like everyone else, but...  Yeah, we need the good...  And we definitely need the...  We definitely need the Thanksgiving, uh...  Yes, extravaganza.  First Thanksgiving play.  Immediately.  Pat told me that he had puked on the stage on purpose.  He missed the bucket several times on purpose  because he hates intern Matt.  Oh, good.  And he made intern Matt have to clean up the vomit.  And he was just smearing the puke into the stage.  Oh, yeah.  He hates Matt?  Yeah.  He hates Matt.  Why?  He hates...  Because he thinks Matt's wasting his opportunity 
[00:33:00]  and he doesn't like that Matt's a part of the show.  He's pissed off that Troy...  Does Pat still listen?  Yeah, Pat still listen.  Oh, okay.  And he's pissed that Troy got hired  because that's probably...  I guess that's the first new hire since...  Oh.  So he looks...  Yeah, but that was a company thing.  I mean...  Oh, Jesus.  Now we're in a weird spot.  I love Troy.  Troy knows that.  Nothing against Troy.  I swear to you.  But they weren't looking externally.  Thank you.  That's what I was trying to say.  Troy already worked for the company.  He worked for Sirius.  They didn't want to add more salaries. 
[00:33:30]  They're just switching...  New salaries.  They're just switching people around.  Right.  Pat was one of the XM guys that got chopped.  Trust me.  I'd have fucking Pat as part of this show in a second.  Over Troy, right?  Over fucking Troy.  Oh, wait.  No, that's not what I mean.  No.  But he really hates intern Matt though.  Well, more importantly, I was talking to Pat Duffy after the broadcast when we were signing  and shit.  He's got a story to tell.  Yeah.  Oh, does he have a story to tell?  Did you hear what he was saying?  No.  No.  I didn't either.  He says he's willing to say it on the air. 
[00:34:00]  But he was engaged.  Oh, I did hear that.  Oh, I did hear that.  Yes, yes.  I did hear that.  A chick that we knew, we set him up basically.  Yeah, they met on the show.  It was a girl that used to do a show.  I actually thought they were married at this point.  Well, they probably should have been.  But it ended.  Yeah, yeah.  Pat Duffy has a story to tell.  Maybe later on in the show he could call in and we'll get into it a little bit.  If not today, it's certainly early next week.  During the week, yeah.  Because we've got a lot of guests today.  Thanks, Kenny.  Thank you.  What else from the live broadcast, man?  Oh, that karaoke guy that really bothered him? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, God.  I loved him.  Because he just was such a, he was obnoxious.  I thought he had Asperger's.  His name was Jordan.  Yeah.  He wasn't, like, I understand when people get up there and they give us shit and everything,  and it's funny and kind of almost good-natured.  He was just nasty, obnoxious, and very angry.  He was just an angry guy.  Well, the problem was, like, there was no reason for it.  No, not.  No, not.  I mean, usually you gotta be, you know, fucking poked a lot to get to that stage.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  He went right to that.  Yeah, we were being nice to him.  Like, oh, come on up.  That's what was strange to me.  And Jimmy was in the middle doing shit right next to me.  Yeah.  Lookin' at Jimmy's face, like, Jimmy's gonna break character any fuckin' moment and just  kill this guy.  Oh, no.  And he chose not to.  Which was even better, obviously.  Yeah, cuz I, to me, the guy was just one of those unflappable guys, but it didn't.  Yeah.  Right.  And this horrible Robert Goulet rendition of fuckin' Sweet Caroline.  Yeah, he picks the song that's your song.  I know.  See that?  He's trying to upstage your version.  That, again, was a little fuckin' passive-aggressive thing. 
[00:35:30]  That was calculated.  That was calculated.  Yes.  He's like, I'll show Anthony how this song is supposed to be sung, even though Anthony's  done it a bunch of times and has killed every time with it.  Yes, Kenny.  He came up to me in the audience, like, I thought the kid was gonna cry, like, complaining,  and I thought he was like a bobo type.  You know, he acted that way.  He's half bobo.  Yeah.  He's half bobo.  So I said, alright, let me see what I could do for ya.  You know, and then I regretted, like, helping the guy out. 
[00:36:00]  No, it worked for the radio show.  What's wrong with you?  It was perfect.  I don't like anybody insulting my friends.  It was perfect, though.  Aw.  It worked.  No, you guys don't deserve it.  You know how hard you guys work day in and day out?  Well, we know.  We should be treated nicely.  Yes.  And you know what?  Go home early today.  What?  All right.  What time?  9.55.  Oh, wow.  You're really giving us a lot of time there, starting the weekend early.  Kenny probably means that too.  Yeah, like him, that five minutes is a whole big thing. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's crazy for Kenny.  I could eat a piece of toast.  Right.  We're company men.  We sure are.  Jesus.  Well, you guys did a great job yesterday.  That play was terrific.  It was fun.  It was great.  Why wasn't Kenny in the play?  I had a line for Kenny.  I added a line for Kenny.  I know you had a job yesterday, but I think that people wanted to see you in that play.  I would love to have seen him.  I was so worried not falling down those steps with Bobo on my back.  Carrying Bobo.  Oh, shit.  That lump of shit. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  That's just dead weight of nothingness.  And I did get his stupid makeup all over my...  Oh, no.  Me and Bob Kelly were losing it, because we know that would absolutely be a problem with  you.  I discussed the situation with the director before the play, and the director maybe suggested  I carry him like a baby style.  Oh, right.  No.  Like cradled in your arms.  Yeah.  But I didn't want to touch him to begin with, so I just threw him around my shoulder and...  Is the suit ruined? 
[00:37:30]  I don't know.  I buy cleaner.  You know, I buy cheap suits.  They're disposable.  Really?  Yeah.  We never noticed.  Yeah.  Look at the colors he chooses.  They have to go in the back room to find those fucking suits for him.  I got a shop in the freak store.  The big and tall.  Big and stupid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone that says they know Jordan, yes, he has Asperger's.  Does he?  That's my first thought.  Oh, Rich is saying.  I don't know.  Rich is rich.  That's something we probably...  A Voss?  No.  Oh, he probably thinks it's a fucking dessert. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  I should've said a meal.  Oh, Jimmy.  Why do I fall under pressure?  You know, we...  But there was so much comedy yesterday that we don't have to blurt out any today.  Thank you, Anthony.  There's going to be a lot of comedy tonight.  Tomorrow, too.  Where?  Right.  Not in Harrisburg.  Oh, yes.  At the Comedy Zone.  Good City.  No, it'll be great.  Saturday is sold out, I think.  So tonight is available.  Saturday early.  Oh, early is sold out.  Okay.  8 and 10.30 both nights.  Very good.  Go see it.  All right.  So, you know what?  Thanks to everyone that showed up yesterday at the Hard Rock Cafe. 
[00:38:30]  We absolutely appreciate it.  And Uncle Nino.  And Uncle Nino.  Oh, my God.  I saw him backstage.  Yeah.  And he had the Santa Claus white stripe on his...  You know, he was wearing his suit backwards.  No, I know.  He acknowledged that on stage.  I know.  He said he looks like a skunk or something.  Yeah.  I said, you have your suit on.  And he goes, no, what the fuck?  That's how we wear it.  All right.  What the fuck?  I like Nino.  He's the best.  He's crazy.  Thanks to Bob Kelly and Rich Voss, too.  They both did great.  We used as to why, like, Voss and Chip, they had kind of street clothes and just a headdress 
[00:39:00]  on, whereas for Bobo's outfit as an Indian, we made him wear just a loincloth.  A loincloth.  And body paint.  And full body makeup.  Like Kamala.  Yeah, like Kamala.  That's his makeup.  Doesn't Kamala have one leg now?  Kamala had a leg amputated, yes.  Oh, boy.  Bobo's makeup, it took Janine an hour at least to put that makeup on.  Really?  And I'm not sure it's off yet.  Was Kamala an active wrestler? 
[00:39:30]  Right now?  I mean, he was still doing it.  No, was he?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So why wouldn't Vince McMahon amputate the leg during, like, the Survivor Series or something?  Oh, do it as, like, a little vignette.  Why not?  Kamala would probably go for it.  We're gonna take your leg.  Whoever loses the match loses a leg.  Yeah.  And then they bring out a fucking saw?  Lose your leg match.  I would watch it.  That would be good.  Why not?  He's gonna lose the leg anyway.  Was he diabetic?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He lost the whole fucking leg.  But it's like he can't even, like, his career, he can't even go to, he wore a, he wrestled barefoot. 
[00:40:00]  And so, like, when he would go to signings, he would go in the Kamala character.  Yeah.  But he can't do that anymore, because he's got no foot.  Like, otherwise, he would just put a fake boot on or something.  Can he go with fake leg?  He'll have to.  The fake legs are amazing.  I saw, I saw a black guy when I was walking home the other day.  Two fake legs walking like, like, like we walk.  How the fuck did they figure that out?  I didn't know they were fake.  Were they the spatula ones or the, do they have fake feet on them?  He went fake, uh, shoes. 
[00:40:30]  Fake shoes?  And he.  Were they spatulas?  No.  The reason I know why they're fake, he was wearing shorts.  Oh, wow.  And he even went with the black version of the legs.  Oh, that's cool.  Because sometimes you see.  Carbon fiber?  Well, sometimes you see, like, a black guy, but he's wearing the, the fake white legs.  Yeah, that kind of looks funny.  But this guy's like, fuck that, man.  And he's got the black fake legs.  Black leg.  Yeah.  Although I bet people would pay to get a picture with one leg Kamala.  Like, I have a picture with Kamala, but I don't have a picture with one leg Kamala. 
[00:41:00]  More so than they would a picture with Virgil.  Oh yeah, Virgil.  He just sits there at those tables.  I love it.  I love it.  He's at every convention.  He's the greatest guy.  Signing nothing for nobody.  No, lines out the door.  That's not true.  No, lines out the door.  Didn't he sign E-Rock's thing?  Yeah, he signed E-Rock's million dollar belt that E-Rock just wanted the million dollar man  to sign.  He fucked up his belt.  He fucked up his belt.  E-Rock wasn't looking.  He took it and signed Virgil on the back of it.  Oh, what a bastard.  Wait, did the million dollar man sign the front or back?  The back, because the back has this, it's not like you can polish it off. 
[00:41:30]  You can't.  I thought you might be able to rub it off.  It's felt on the back.  Yeah.  So they signed the felt part.  And then Virgil also signed the felt part right next to him.  But why wasn't E-Rock more aware?  So annoyed.  Because E-Rock was trying to network with the million dollar man's son, because he thought  the million dollar man's son would become a big wrestler.  And you don't think someone's just going to sign your shit.  And so while that was happening, Virgil just took it.  And I think he tried to charge him too.  Because I've been on a Virgil line.  He loves to try to charge people for shit. 
[00:42:00]  That fucking Virgil is about a piece of shit.  Well, he only signs three things per show, so he's got to make his money somewhere.  Is he a nice guy?  Well, he's nice when he's trying to get your money, you know.  But I have to try to sneak pictures of him every time, because I know that if he saw me  taking a picture of him with no line, which I do every time I see him, he would try to  charge me to take the picture.  What an asshole.  That's when you go, fuck you.  Right.  Just keep walking.  Why are you so worried about Virgil?  Virgil.  Alright, listen. 
[00:42:30]  Today we've got CM Punk, speaking of wrestlers.  He's like the number one guy, right Sam?  He's the guy right now.  Yeah, he's super popular.  He's the guy.  He is the main guy, and he's going to be on our show at 815.  We're very excited.  I've never heard of him.  I haven't followed wrestling in a while.  He's talked a lot of shit about the McMahons on TV.  Oh boy.  That's right.  Look out.  Should we play that promo?  That put him over the top?  Yeah.  Or is that going to be a waste of time for people out there?  I don't think so.  I don't know who he is.  Sam says that this is one of the best promos made.  In recent years, right?  It was great.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  It completely...  Even Travis.  Travis watched wrestling when it was cool.  Right.  And has stopped watching wrestling since.  By cool, you mean good?  No.  That's not what I mean, Travis.  And he started watching again because of his promo.  Also, Brian Regan stopping by today.  And I don't know how to say her name, but she's a really...  Eliza Schlesinger.  Thank you.  Yes, I haven't seen her in a while.  She's a very hot female comic.  She's funny.  She's funny as well.  One last comic.  Yes.  I don't know her well, but I know her just from the circuit and from L.A. and stuff. 
[00:43:30]  And just the fact that Roland couldn't say her name, this idiot.  He kept going...  What did he keep calling her?  Ilsa Schlesinger.  And if you want to see Ilsa Schlesinger, she's going to be here.  Yeah, so...  What?  She's stopping by too.  I think she's playing Caroline's?  I don't know.  I think.  I was Googling Ilsa.  Caroline's.  Caroline's.  Shut up.  God, that douche.  He didn't like his version?  No!  It's terrible!  Because it was in Anthony's territory.  Oh!  He picked Anthony's song.  That's such a dick move. 
[00:44:00]  If you do Sweet Caroline, you've got to sing it like fucking Neil.  Come on.  She's not at Caroline's.  There was a million songs he could have picked.  He picked that one.  Yeah.  Where is she?  She is because when I was trying to get her plug information, I was looking up ISLA.  She doesn't have any dates until next weekend, and that's in Kansas.  Isla Schlesinger.  Isla Schlesinger.  Isla Schlesinger.  Isla Schlesinger.  Isla.  Yeah, Isla.  Isla is going to be.  Isla going to be.  She's going to be here.  Alright.  Let's go through the CM Punk promo.  Okay.  How long ago was this?  This was in June. 
[00:44:30]  Okay.  It put him on the next level.  It put him over the top.  It made him a main event.  One fucking spot.  One promo.  Alright.  Yeah, he's fighting in the world title, in the WWE title match.  No, I don't care who has the titles in general.  I mean, as far as he's the number one wrestler right now, as far as heat goes.  He's one of the first guys whose t-shirt is outselling John Cena's t-shirt.  Oh, my God.  Does he have a popular shirt, John Cena?  John Cena, all of John Cena's shirts are popular.  What about the Not Sam shirt?  Almost as popular as the CM Punk shirt.  Wow.  Although I didn't see, I saw a couple live from the Compound shirts at the Hard Rock. 
[00:45:00]  Yes, you did.  Not one Not Sam shirt.  No, that's a shame.  That is sad.  All right, let's hit this.  Struts right up there.  Turns around.  I don't know.  Who's laying on the ground?  That's John Cena.  John Cena, he had just been put through a table.  He seems to have injured John Cena a little bit.  Oh, I hope he's okay.  John's been on our show. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, I like John.  And now he's going to, I don't know, talk about it?  That's right.  That's right.  John Cena speared.  John Cena, while you lay there, hopefully as uncomfortable as you possibly can be, I want you to listen to me.  I want you to digest this because before I leave in three weeks with your WWE championship, I have a lot of things I want to get off my chest.  The back story is he was going into a WWE championship match, and he didn't have his contract re-signed. 
[00:46:00]  Oh.  That's the back story.  Oh.  I love the fact these dumbbells are just booing.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just dopes.  It's entertainment.  It's entertainment.  I guess.  Sports entertainment.  I was all in for a while.  Yeah, but when you really thought there was animosity.  When you know that they've rehearsed every move.  I think it's still fun.  Right.  But to be booing.  No, it's...  He's booing in a movie theater.  You tell him that when he comes in here.  No, I don't have a problem with him.  It's the fans booing.  I would have been cheering him, but I would boo other people. 
[00:46:30]  I'll be booing at Survivor Series on Sunday.  Ah.  All right.  Hit it.  I don't hate you, John.  I don't even dislike you.  I do like you.  I like you a hell of a lot more than I like most people in the back.  I hate this idea that you're the best.  Because you're not.  I'm the best.  I'm the best in the world. 
[00:47:00]  There's one thing.  Bo Hinch, can you pause this?  I love the fact that the way they did this, Cena just has to lay there like he's in pain and can't move.  Well, you take a spear through a table.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  You know what I mean?  That's a good point.  That'll do it.  Fair enough.  All right.  You're right, Sam.  Who's better at than I am?  And that's kissing Vince McMahon's ass.  Whoa.  You want to talk about the boss?  You're as good as kissing Vince's ass as Hulk Hogan was. 
[00:47:30]  What?  Oh.  Hogan works for a different company.  Oh, man.  You can't mention Hulk Hogan?  He's bringing it up, though.  He's no Hulkamaniac.  Let me tell you something, brother.  Shut up.  Who's better?  Vince Center fucking hack.  Who's better in front of the mic?  Hulk Hogan or The Rock?  Oh, The Rock.  The Rock.  I would jump on that one in a second.  Rock all the fucking way.  But Macho Man.  Way better, actually.  Fucking great.  Macho Man was great.  I love it.  Macho was better than Hulk.  Yeah.  Who was the best ever in front of the mic? 
[00:48:00]  Rock.  I would say Steve Austin.  Was he?  Oh.  Stone Cold.  Fuck, Sam.  You might have just fucking trumped me.  Stone Cold.  Stone Cold is damn good.  You're going to see Steve Austin?  I am.  Can I go?  No.  Are you going to be in a movie with him?  No.  What about Warrior?  Warrior was not great.  Warrior says.  Warrior was not great.  Warrior says that Hulk Hogan.  Dude, all right.  Shut up.  Wow, you would give Steve Austin over The Rock.  Now you got me thinking. 
[00:48:30]  Because you got some fucking amazing.  The best mic guys are Stone Cold, The Rock, Ric Flair, Shawn Michaels.  Yeah.  I guess Hulk Hogan.  Hulk you'd put up in the top five?  Yeah, I mean, he got people to go to shows.  No, that's fine.  But because it was the total package.  Yeah.  We're talking just mic shit right now.  Yeah.  I don't think Hulk should be in the top five.  How about the Shockmaster?  Shockmaster.  Shockmaster was great.  What about Mick Foley?  Mick Foley's good. 
[00:49:00]  He's not up.  He's not with.  Hulk Hogan better than Mick Foley.  I can't say that, no.  Oh.  Mick Foley's probably better than Hulk Hogan.  Thank you.  I think so.  And that's the package thing you were talking about.  Hulk Hogan relied on him being just a giant blonde muscle man, whereas Mick Foley really  had to be good.  He had to work hard.  He had to be good on the mic.  Yep.  Hit it.  I don't know if you're as good as Dwayne, though.  He's a pretty good ass kisser.  He's talking about The Rock.  The Rock.  Always was and still is.  Oops.  I'm breaking the fourth wall. 
[00:49:30]  I am the best wrestler in the world.  I've been the best ever since day one when I walked into this company, and I've been  vilified and hated since that day because Paul Heyman saw something in me that nobody  else wanted to admit.  That's right.  I'm a Paul Heyman guy.  You know who else was a Paul Heyman guy? 
[00:50:00]  Brock Lesnar.  And he split just like I'm splitting, but the biggest difference between me and Brock is  I'm going to leave with the WWE championship.  Oh, boy.  Here's one thing people like about this guy.  He's not yelling.  Yeah.  He's not screaming like a dope.  He's one of these logical speaking villains.  Yeah, but he's a good talker.  He's not yelling and making a ruckus.  And also, a lot of this stuff that he's talking about was based in truths that, like, you  know, all the internet rumors.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's addressing all this stuff, and nobody knows whether this is, you know, real or fixed. 
[00:50:30]  As long as it takes Cena to get up, for fuck's sake.  I would have been up already twice.  I know.  This is laying there.  Stop napping.  I've grabbed so many of Vincent K. McMahon's imaginary brass rings that it's finally dawned  on me that they're just that.  They're completely imaginary.  The only thing that's real is me, and the fact that day in and day out, for almost six 
[00:51:00]  years, I have proved to everybody in the world that I am the best on this microphone, in that  ring, even commentary.  The best, Jerry.  The best.  Nobody can touch me.  And yet, no matter how many times I've proved it.  Get up, Cena, for fuck's sake.  I'm not on your lovely little collector cups.  I'm not on the cover of the program.  I'm barely promoted.  I don't get to be in movies.  I'm certainly not on any crappy show on the USA Network.  I'm not on the poster of WrestleMania. 
[00:51:30]  I'm not on the signature that's produced at the start of the show.  I'm not on Conan O'Brien.  I'm not on Jimmy Fallon.  But the fact of the matter is, I should be.  And trust me, this isn't sour grapes.  But the fact that Dwayne is in the main event of WrestleMania next year, and I'm not, makes  me sick.  Dwayne.  Dwayne.  Well.  He's a force to be reckoned with, I think.  Oh, hey.  Let me get something straight. 
[00:52:00]  Those of you who are cheering me right now, you are just the biggest part of me leaving  as anything else.  Because you're the ones that are sipping out of those collector cups right now.  You're the ones that buy those programs that my face isn't on the cover of.  And then at five in the morning at the airport, you try to shove it in my face so you can get  an autograph and try to sell it on eBay because you're too lazy to go get a real job.  He's healing it up pretty good.  Yeah, he is.  Good.  Calling the crowd out.  I'm leaving with the WWE Championship on July 17th. 
[00:52:30]  And who knows?  Maybe I'll go defend it in New Japan Pro Wrestling.  Maybe I'll go back to Ring of Honor.  What?  Whoa.  Talking about other promotions.  Crazy shit.  Do you think guys like being heels more than good guys?  It's way funner.  It is, right?  Because you just get to attack the crowd, who they probably all hate anyway.  Bunch of dopes.  Do you think they enjoy insulting the crowd?  They love it.  I've never met one wrestler who says he prefers being a babyface. 
[00:53:00]  Really?  Ever.  They call him babyface in heels?  Who's like the ultimate babyface that never turned?  John Cena is right now.  Oh, he's the loved guy?  Yeah, but everybody wants him to turn because he's been babyface for so long.  Everybody hates him.  Will he turn?  Yeah, he will.  And when they turn, do people know what it is?  It's part of the whole thing they understand?  Or are there people that really believe it?  Well, they're like, it's still real to me!  Yeah.  That was always the best part of wrestling.  The kids are like, the heel turn.  When you were all in with the guy, and all of a sudden he's like, what the fuck?  You just hit the wrong guy with the chair. 
[00:53:30]  I don't understand what's going on.  It's like when Stone Cold shook Vince McMahon's hand, and everybody went, no!  Yeah.  No, no.  If it's done right, it's so fucking awesome to watch, man.  When Bob Backlund got hit by the, he was the best Mike guy.  I just want to go in there and do the best I can and try to pin him according to the rules.  Enough about Bob Backlund.  You don't think he was a good Mike guy?  Bob Backlund.  He was horrible.  You didn't like Bob Backlund?  He's a lunatic.  He's a good champion.  People are saying, a bunch of them, Sam, Chris Jericho should be in the top five as far 
[00:54:00]  as Mike Geis.  Jericho was fucking great.  Was he very good?  Yeah.  I think he's a strong guy.  In what, general?  I think physically?  Yes.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Yes, I think he's muscular.  Hey, Cole Cabana, how you doing?  The reason I'm leaving is you people, because after I'm gone, you're still going to pour  money into this company.  I'm just a spoke on the wheel.  The wheel's going to keep turning, and I understand that.  But Vince McMahon's going to make money to spite himself. 
[00:54:30]  He's a millionaire who should be a billionaire.  You know why he's not a billionaire?  It's because he surrounds himself with glad-handing, nonsensical, yes-men like John Laurinaitis,  who's going to tell him everything that he wants to hear.  By the way, pause.  You want to show balls as a wrestler?  Start going after the campaign.  Yeah, yeah.  Make fun of the bad campaign.  Ah, there you go.  She has no shot at winning. 
[00:55:00]  Like John Laurinaitis, who's going to tell him everything that he wants to hear.  And I'd like to think that maybe this company will be better after Vince McMahon's dead,  but the fact is, it's going to get taken over by his idiotic daughter and his doofus son-in-law  and the rest of his stupid family.  Let me tell you a personal story about Vince McMahon.  John Cena's still laying there hurt.  You're going to do this whole bully campaign? 
[00:55:30]  Ah, his mic got shut off.  Oh, no.  He turned his mic off.  He turned his mic off.  Wow.  He didn't want to hear the personal story out there.  Oh.  Vince isn't happy.  He turned his mic off.  But then, I mean, they did the gimmick really good.  He won the title.  Yeah.  At the pay-per-view.  And then he, quote-unquote, left the company.  And then a week later, he showed up at Comic-Con in San Diego as a fan, just holding the belt. 
[00:56:00]  He was walking around on the floor.  And so people were taking pictures of him.  He showed up at a couple indie wrestling shows with the belt.  Yeah.  And so it was like, whoa.  And then, I mean, obviously he came back.  But this promo put him over so busy.  He's the biggest babyface there is right now.  He's a babyface now?  Now he is.  I mean, you can't.  When you do a heel promo that is that good, that that many people like.  Oh, damn.  You don't have a choice.  You cannot stay heel because everybody cheered.  So how do they turn him babyface after this?  Everybody cheered.  Yeah, you become cheered. 
[00:56:30]  But was there an actual thing that happened that all of a sudden he showed the crowd, no,  I'm actually a good guy?  No.  It's just like Stone Cold.  It was like enough people are cheering you that it's just what it is now.  Wow, that's cool.  Because they like you and then they think you're being a dick.  They still like you.  You can be a badass babyface.  Oh, all right.  You don't have to be a pussy.  It's like they couldn't book him facing their babyfaces because they cheered him more than the  babyface.  Did he?  Did he?  So who does he fight now?  He fights the heels now.  He's fighting Alberto Del Rio.  Okay.  Did he beat John Cena? 
[00:57:00]  He beat John Cena.  In a pay-per-view?  Yes.  So he's the champion?  No, no, no, no, no.  John Cena.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  There's lots of controversy around it right now.  Oh, boy, I bet.  Yeah.  I won't drag you through it, but Alberto Del Rio is the champion right now.  So why don't you interview him?  I would love to interview him.  We don't know shit about this.  I know about it.  We'll go get coffee.  We won't leave for the day.  Okay.  You talked to him for half.  Franchise.  I will come back.  Franchise.  I'm not going to stop you from doing that.  Because we're going to look silly.  I don't know any of this shit. 
[00:57:30]  I do.  You do?  Yeah.  All right, good.  Yeah, heel, turn, punk, baby face.  Perfect.  That's all I need is those three words.  Perfect.  All right, we should take a break.  Yes.  He's a MMA fan.  All right, good.  I saw Ant's tweet last night.  He's chomping at the bit.  Oh, what?  About the Syracuse guy.  Well, I'm just fucking, uh, I'm flustered here at this whole college, uh, fucking scandal.  How do we get jobs doing that?  We'll explain next.  Just flustered.  And also, I asked for the South Park clips, because everyone's talking about how they handled 
[00:58:00]  the whole Penn State thing.  So we got some clips from South Park.  How great is South Park when you allow them just, when you allow fucking funny people to  be funny?  That's what you get.  A great show.  Absolutely so.  Good for them.  And then, of course, uh, CM Punk, Brian Regan, and, uh...  Eliza.  Eliza.  Schlesinger.  Schlesinger.  She's playing Carolinas this weekend.  Is she?  I don't think so, no.  No, she's not playing Carolinas this weekend.  Why?  What do you mean?  Why?  Because somebody else is promoting?  Is she promoting anything, or is she just coming in?  I, again, I...  I don't care if she's promoting anything. 
[00:58:30]  I googled her name as Roland spelled it and got no results.  I don't, I don't know what she's promoting.  So why is she coming in?  I mean, we don't mind.  She just wants to be on the show, I guess.  A hangout.  It's all about exposure in this business.  Sometimes if you're in town, if LA Comics isn't in town.  Fair enough.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Stay there.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. Live.  Here's the latest batch of F.E.E.R.S.  Fuck you!  Yeah, I'd like to send a big fuck you to all the women in my gym that walk around naked  in the locker room.

[01:01:30]  I wonder what the sex man is playing this for.  Huh.  I don't know, man.  I'm trying to figure it out.  A heart-headed man.  He was brutally handsome.  She was terminally good.  She held him up.  Any idea?  Oh, I don't.  You do?  Yes.  What?  Eagles.  Yes.  Get in topical. 
[01:02:00]  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  Sexy, what do you got?  Good morning.  What's that?  Oh.  Sex.  That's terrible.  Sex man's playing the Eagles.  Yeah.  Well, the Eagles will be touring next year for their 40th anniversary.  Holy shit.  40th anniversary?  But they never stopped touring. 
[01:02:30]  I think my sister just told me the other day she saw the Eagles.  It's crazy.  What's going on?  I know my sister told me that.  She's a huge Eagles fan.  She lives in Florida.  You know, E-Rock's hometown.  Yeah.  Home state, I should say.  I'm from Long Island.  E-Rock was born and raised in Florida.  Florida boy.  My sister was born on Long Island but moved down to Florida.  Oh, just the opposite.  Very different than E-Rock.  And she's a huge Eagles fan with her husband.  And I really believe she saw them within the last year. 
[01:03:00]  So what are you talking about?  Does it mean all the members are getting back together?  Is it so much the tour part or the 40 years part?  I think it's the 40 years part.  So basically they're going to continue to tour.  They'll continue to tour.  That's what they should say.  Yeah.  Eagles fan, Ant?  No.  That Hotel California doesn't get you?  No, I like the Eagles.  Some of those songs, man, you know, rock radio fucking played them to death.  But when you hear Freebird or Hotel California, you're not really... 
[01:03:30]  Freebird?  I fucking love Freebird still.  You don't like Freebird?  Well, that's Skinner.  But you don't like Freebird?  It's overplayed for you?  Too overplayed.  The song's too long.  I don't like long-ass fucking songs that I've heard 80 million times.  No?  Yeah.  Then you should listen to AM radio.  I like Hotel California, though.  AM radio had like a four-minute version of Freebird for you.  Yeah.  That's true.  They couldn't deal with long songs, either.  Didn't Hotel California come out about the same time as that Boston album and Frampton 
[01:04:00]  comes alive?  Watch this.  I'm going with 1975.  Oh.  Well.  1976 was a big year.  We've done this break before.  Yes.  Yes.  76-ish.  I think it was around the same time, though, right?  I'm going 75.  Yeah?  What year have you got?  You're going 76?  I was going to go 75 also.  Why?  Why?  Because I think it was 75.  But you were pushing for 76.  Well, was 76 Frampton Comes Alive? 
[01:04:30]  And, uh...  76 was absolutely Boston's first album.  Yeah?  I'll bet money on that.  All right.  Let's see.  When was Hotel California?  December.  It was recorded.  Yeah, 75.  Recorded or released?  No.  Released.  Oh, shit.  That means it's 76.  You would have been wrong either way.  It was recorded between March and October of 1976.  Released December of 1976.  That's almost 77 when it was released.  Fuck.  You were way off.  So it was around the same time, though. 
[01:05:00]  Because that was like the third album in that trifecta of holy shit albums that year.  Well, the golden years was 75, 76, 77.  And then that stupid disco started hitting that 78 year.  Disco.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. -dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  What is that?  I don't know.  Disco Inferno?  Oh, right.  Burn Baby Burn, Disco Inferno.  And then 78 led us into New Wave. 
[01:05:30]  Yes, a little new wave pop.  But the golden year is, I would say, 75, 76, 77.  Yeah.  Although the Stones had some amazing albums in the earlier 70s, but whatever.  Hotel California.  Here's a guy who saw the Eagles in Vegas two weeks ago.  Vegas.  It just means they're continuing to tour.  South Park fucking gave Penn State a beating.  What'd they do?  They fucking skewered them.  What'd they do?  They went all in, man, about kid touching. 
[01:06:00]  Oh.  Well, that's always fun.  This case is getting fucking strange, man.  Yeah, a lot of people lying.  More victims coming forward.  There's some lying going on.  It seems like there was a major cover-up that goes way the fuck back.  Yelp.  Way the fuck back.  Yeah.  Seems like a lot of people knew.  Oh, yeah, a lot of people knew.  A lot of people didn't do anything about it.  And they wanted to protect some kind of legacy over kid touching. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, protect jobs, protect the reputation of the school and the coaches.  And it's all crumbling now.  Yes.  South Park.  Kenny and his siblings go to Child Protective Services.  The guy there is making Penn State jokes.  Now, I've been looking over your file, and I see you kids have all been horribly physically and emotionally abused.  Oh, whoops.  That isn't your case file.  It's the Penn State University Gazette.  I'm joking.  That's just a joke. 
[01:07:00]  We like to have fun here.  It is your case file.  I was just all like, it's the Penn State Gazette to be like a joke.  We have fun.  That's the guy in charge of Child Protective Services.  He just likes to, you know, have a good time.  We have fun.  Matt and Trey don't give a fuck.  Now, listen, you're going to be put into a foster home, so I need to know, would you like to go to Neverland Ranch, a Catholic church, or Penn State University?  We're having fun here, aren't we?  I come up with these, and the guys, it's good to laugh. 
[01:07:30]  I just asked them if they wanted to go to Neverland, a Catholic church, or Penn State.  I'm a trickster.  People say I'm really meant for comedy.  Here's my head shot, just in case you know anybody.  Can't hurt, right?  Okay, now, are we all starting to feel a little bit better?  Oh, come on, now.  How about that smile?  I'm going to get you to smile.  I'm going to get you to smile.  A Penn State administrator walks into a bar.  Where's that smile?  How about this one?  Joe Paterno doesn't walk into a police station.  Come on, that's a good one. 
[01:08:00]  Wow.  Are they still defending Joe Pa?  Joe Pa.  I don't see them defending Joe Pa as much on Twitter these days.  Maybe a few, but the majority of people, I think, are done defending that asshole.  They went away, right?  That asshole.  Now that we mention it, a few will pop up today, I understand.  Feel free.  In general, most of you Joe Pa people went away.  Fucking sells his house to his wife in June or July for a dollar?  For a buck. 
[01:08:30]  Saw things coming, maybe.  He knew this tidal wave of shit was coming his way.  Yeah, don't want to lose the house.  Cartman sees CPS more Penn State jokes.  Hi there, how you doing?  My name's Mr. Adams, and I'm with Child Protective Services.  Here's my headshot.  I just need to get some information from you, if that's okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, now, it says here your mother was operating a meth lab.  That's right.  And it also says here that Penn State prefers to be losing at halftime?  Because at Penn State, they like when you're a little behind in the locker room. 
[01:09:00]  That's a joke.  Did you get that one?  It's a play on words.  We like to have fun here.  Dude, do you think this is funny?  We just, no, we just like to have fun here.  Well, I'll tell you something.  Being from a low-income household isn't funny.  Oh, hell no.  My mama's so poor, she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam.  Oh, Jesus.  What, what, is that supposed to be some kind of joke?  You think you're funny?  A joke?  You think being poor is a joke?  Could be worse.  How?  Could be in Happy Valley. 
[01:09:30]  On a scale from one to ten, how old should you be to stay away from Penn State?  Dude, my mama's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle, so she's got to go greyhound off the handle.  Two Penn State administrators walk into a butt.  Oh, Penn State's reputation is fucked.  I look into a butt.  They deserve it.  They're just fucked.  But you can't just turn all your frustrations on a little kid who can't defend himself. 
[01:10:00]  I mean, what do you think this is?  The shower room at Penn State?  I'm kidding.  We like to have fun in our department, so I was like, what?  Is this like the shower room at Penn State?  I joke around.  This is my headshot.  Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?  All you're doing is taking something topical and revamping old Catholic jokes.  That's funny.  Yeah.  What have I done?  I took you kids from your parents without even checking into where you were going.  I put innocent children into a dangerous environment. 
[01:10:30]  What am I, a recruitment coach for Penn State?  It's not funny!  Jesus.  They're good, man.  God damn.  One more.  Very topical.  Absolutely.  Like the sex man.  Take all these kids back to their parents.  We've embarrassed the system and made it something nobody wants to be a part of.  It's like a Penn State homecoming party! 
[01:11:00]  You think there's going to be a lot of South Park fans at Penn State?  Yeah, probably.  That's funny, man.  Yeah, I think it's just those hardcore few that defend to the end.  Fuck them.  Can you do those jokes if it's not a cartoon?  No, but that's the only reason is because the networks won't let you do them.  That's it.  Yeah.  They accept we're a dumb country who accepts parody from cartoons.  And those guys are brilliant, man.  So you go on one of these late night talk shows and you go, look, I got a couple of these Penn State jokes I want to throw out there. 
[01:11:30]  Never.  Not a chance, right?  Never.  Wow.  Never.  I mean, you could do it.  No, you actually could do some.  But the stuff about the walk into a butt or anything that's real pedophilia you can't touch.  Walk into a butt.  But my problem is not that Letterman or Leno or fucking Fallon won't let you do it.  It's Comedy Central would be weird about it, but they're okay with the cartoon.  Oh, I see.  If you had a half hour special on Comedy Central and said, well, I'm going to do some Penn State jokes, now what happens?  I don't know if they'd let you or not.  They may. 
[01:12:00]  They may not.  South Park is also smart, though, because they have this character who nobody is laughing at his jokes.  So technically you can get away with more saying, like, if somebody accuses him of making bad jokes, they could say, well, I mean, the character was supposed to make bad jokes.  Yeah, but in South Park, they brutalize everything so badly.  Like, that's how they're doing it this week.  But then they'll do something else where they'll just head on, make fun of fucking Christopher Reed being paralyzed.  And they do exactly what you should do, being funny.  Those guys are fucking great.  Breaking.  They attack everything.  I read Nixon's testimony before the grand jury about 40 years ago. 
[01:12:30]  And I watched James Murdoch testify before a parliamentary committee.  And I was struck by the similar line to all three about people who will do anything for their own ends, their own institutional goals, with victims of all kinds, whether it's criminal, whether it is about undermining the Constitution of a country,  that all perspective is lost in the cover-up of these terrible, terrible things by Murdoch, by Nixon, by the people at Penn State. 
[01:13:00]  It is something that obviously is part of the human story.  But when it gets to Woodward or Bernstein, like we've seen in these three instances, where institutions that affect whole countries, whole states, and the lives of young people,  and the people we trust with leadership, the Murdochs, the Nixons, the people at Penn State.  Leave me out of this.  He keeps bringing up Nixon. 
[01:13:30]  I've been dead.  Leave me alone, you Jew.  Yeah, I guess his point is that, you know, this has been going on for a long fucking time.  We protect the institution over what's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But enough with Nixon.  Nixon, that was a long time ago.  Yeah.  And what Nixon did wasn't that bad.  He did break it.  The water get break in.  And we've talked about it before, but anyone who thinks that the Illuminati runs anything, the president was brought down by that nonsense.  Yeah.  He just wanted to know what the Democrats were up to.  That's all it was.  That's it.  Bust into their offices, go through a few files, see if they got any lists on people, any info on them. 
[01:14:00]  Could he have survived if he had handled it better?  Who?  Nixon.  I don't know, because it was tied right back to the White House.  If he had been more truthful about it.  Yeah, but if you're more truthful, then you instantly get the connection between the White House and the crime.  You know, it was such a breach of trust.  It really was.  The actual act itself and what they were looking for wasn't that bad.  But the breach of trust that the president would try to get a bunch of fucking half-assed crooks to break in somewhere and, you know, just do something illegal like that. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  Okay.  Against American citizens.  They also found Mike McQuarrie for an exclusive interview.  McQuarrie.  This was unbelievable because CBS fucking teased the hell out of it.  Yeah, of course.  They finally found Mike McQuarrie and they had the exclusive.  Right, Sam?  Yeah.  That's right.  All day.  That's right.  All day.  All day.  They promoted the fact that they were going to talk to a guy who saw someone fucking a 10-year-old in the ass. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  Because it was right after the Bob Costas interview.  Right.  So they were like, you think that's good.  Right.  Well, wait till you see what we got.  Right.  This guy saw a little kid get fucked in the ass.  McQuarrie.  And the scumbag mainstream media, this is what you got after they teased it for forever.  Today, he spoke for the first time since the scandal broke.  Do you have any idea when you think you might be ready to talk?  This process has to play out.  I just don't have anything else to say at all. 
[01:15:30]  Thank you.  And then just one last thing.  Just describe your emotions right now.  All over the place.  Just kind of shaking.  Crazy?  Crazy.  And you said what?  Like a snow globe.  Like a snow globe.  Yes, sir.  And that's it.  That's it.  It's like Sam's one question only there.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So it's all advertising dollars based on the fact they were going to talk to a guy who saw someone fucking a 10-year-old.  Yeah, that's it.  Very good.  Media deserves to have it.  And that's what you get in the end.  Good.  I don't have the exact facts. 
[01:16:00]  Maybe someone can help me out.  But we also learned yesterday that Mike McQuarrie, after he supposedly told Joe Pa about what happened in the shower with Sandusky and the 10-year-old.  Yeah.  The rape, obviously, that we all are familiar with at this point.  He fucking played golf with Sandusky.  Oh, yeah?  Amir.  I don't have the exact facts.  If you got that, Sam, that would be great.  But, you know, within like three months or something like that, he was playing golf with Sandusky.  Sandusky carried the balls in his mouth? 
[01:16:30]  He had a really small young bag.  Yes.  They pretty much say they could prove this.  That it didn't affect his relationship with Sandusky, basically, after what he saw Sandusky doing to a 10-year-old.  This shit is fucked up.  He just wanted to keep his gig.  Yeah.  Everyone was trying to protect their gigs, right?  Yeah.  Well, the legacy.  If that was one thing that the Nixon obsessed, whoever that was on the...  That was Woodward and Bernstein's Bernstein.  They are... 
[01:17:00]  Protecting the institution was more important, though.  Sure.  And protecting Penn State.  If they had just fucking fired this guy and taken the hit, people would have respected that.  Yeah.  All right.  Here you go.  That was Liddy.  Here's the headline.  Go back to the headline.  Mike McQuarrie reportedly attended Jerry Sandusky's golf fundraiser one month and one year after witnessing alleged rape.  He did it twice.  Twice?  First, he did it one month after, and then again a year after he did it.  Fundraiser one month and one year.  So he went to the 2002 and the 2003 fundraiser. 
[01:17:30]  He probably did it because he knew he could cheat, you know?  What's going to happen?  He hits the ball and fucking maybe kicks it with his foot and Sandusky's going to say something?  Yeah.  It's like, look, dude.  I saw you fucking a 10-year-old boy, all right?  Exactly.  I'm going to move my ball a little closer to the cup.  Yeah.  10 under par.  Wink, wink.  Yeah.  Shot like a 62 or something, you think?  Yeah, yeah.  Sandusky backed it up.  Yeah, boy, he's a great golfer.  This kid's good.  What is that about?  It's about that no one, he didn't care. 
[01:18:00]  He's trying to come off like this hero.  He didn't give a shit.  Some boy's getting fucked in the ass.  Whatever.  You want to play golf?  If you get into McQuarrie's head, you know.  Quarrie.  If you do too much, then they get rid of you, and then you want to be a football coach.  Now you're fucked.  Yeah, you're.  Because not only do they get rid of you, they might get rid of you under some suspicious  circumstances.  Could be a rat.  Because now they need an excuse why they got rid of you, so then they find some weird little  dumb thing.  Yeah.  And blow that out of proportion.  They don't want to fire people all the time, right? 
[01:18:30]  Yup.  There's always something they could find.  And of course, we got breaking news.  What?  We got a Syracuse gang.  Oh, my God.  The ball boy got fucked or jerked off or something.  Molested.  Molested.  You will be molested.  Molested.  Did they say that he got fucking abused from the time he was seven until 27?  Or is that a misprint?  What?  What, this guy in Syracuse?  Yeah, there's a misprint.  The ball boy?  That's a long time to be getting, uh, tooled. 
[01:19:00]  27?  And his job is the ball boy.  I mean, this shit writes itself.  Oh, the ball boy.  The ball boy's being touched by one of the coaches in Syracuse?  Yes.  Technically, Jim Boeheim, the coach, said that it was investigated in 2005 and proved to not  be true.  So he's standing by his assistant.  Oh, what?  Go orange.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that guy looks a little, uh...  Yeah.  I mean...  He looks...  When you get accused of being a pedophile, your face becomes what a pedophile looks like. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  Why is that?  That's what a pedophile looks like.  And it doesn't matter who it is.  Like, guess what a pedophile looks like?  Like, anyone that looks sort of like Sandusky?  Yeah.  That looks like a pedophile to me.  But you're right.  Like, that just would have been some coach guy.  We'd have looked at that and went, oh, yeah, coach.  Yeah.  And the second he's accused of being a pedophile, it's like, oh, yeah, you can see it in his  face.  He looks like a pedophile.  Oh, he looks like a pedophile.  That's what a pedophile looks like.  Oh, yeah.  Well, so, uh, really, he's standing behind the coach.  The assistant coach.  Yeah, the coach, Jim Boeheim, is standing behind him.  Better than standing in front of him. 
[01:20:00]  I got it.  You know?  We like to have fun here.  But I would imagine it's, it's really, really tough to come forward with, with this type  of allegation.  Yeah.  Why would, why would someone come forward with an allegation like that?  It's, I don't know.  It's quite an embarrassment for you, no?  Well, they said that you have to admit that some, uh, man was touching you and fondling  your balls.  Yeah.  So you come forward with this shit and then, then the coach goes, nope, I'm standing behind  my assistant coach. 
[01:20:30]  I heard he tugged like their dicks really hard.  That's like the allegation.  Are you kidding?  No.  This, the, the assistant coach?  Yeah, yeah.  Like he tugged on the dicks and, and the, the victim was saying, uh, didn't Kenny, yeah,  Kenny knows about this one.  Of course he does.  He's probably had his rotten little dick tugged on hard.  Kenny, what was the actual, uh, quote there from the victim?  I heard a clip on 10, 10, uh, wins news driving in.  Yes.  And the guy sounds like he's a little light in the loafers.  Oh. 
[01:21:00]  And, uh, he was describing how the guy would yank it and he would try to resist and the  guy would tell him to relax and he would tug it harder.  Ha, ha, ha.  He loved jerking off.  He loved jerking the kids off.  That's more than jerking off.  He, he was angry about it.  Yeah, he was angry.  Pulling on that dick.  Like he was trying to pull a carrot out of the ground.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe they could find that.  It was on 10, 10 wins when I was driving in.  Wow.  Plus all the Penn State kids look like assholes for backing Joe Pa.  So none of the, none of the Syracuse kids are going to be like, leave him alone because 
[01:21:30]  they don't want to look like assholes.  They're not backing Bernie?  No.  Bernie Fine.  It's the assistant coach.  It's not like if he was Boeheim, they would probably back him.  He's a fucking legend, man.  Yeah.  He's a god in those parts.  Yeah.  He is an absolute god up there.  Bernie Fine?  Hey, wait a minute.  My last name's Fine.  Larry Fine.  I didn't know we had a pedophile in the family.  Oh, why don't you go tell Curly?  Run to Curly. 
[01:22:00]  Go tell Curly.  Oh, boy.  I remember my Uncle Bernie Fine diddling me in the shower.  Ah, certainly.  Nah, nah.  Hey, Bernie.  Stop pulling my cock so hard.  Yeah, relax a little bit.  Buy all the anger.  It's going to be hard to come if you pull my dick off.  Hey, why don't you put my balls in your mouth?  Make it feel a little better. 
[01:22:30]  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Yeah, his name is Bernie Fine.  Bernie Fine.  Bernie Fine.  He's the assistant coach?  Which is, uh...  Is he still the assistant coach?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, I think he's been the assistant coach for...  Forever?  ...34, 35 seasons.  Damn.  Fine is in his 35th season as an assistant to coach Jim Boeheim.  Jim Boeheim released a statement saying,  This matter was fully investigated by the university in 2005,  and it was determined that the allegations were unfounded. 
[01:23:00]  I have known Bernie Fine for more than 40 years.  So have I.  I have never...  He's funny.  Funny.  Not funny.  Ha ha.  Funny queer.  Oh, boy.  He's funny queer.  Nah, nah.  Hey, look out, Larry.  He's coming after you.  Oh, no.  My hiney hurts.  Why is Bernie always over the house babysitting us?  Ah, get some lard for your asshole. 
[01:23:30]  Ah, that's the ticket.  Cut my balls at least, Bernie.  Jimmy, you believe the victim?  I don't know enough about it, to be honest.  Sometimes people will lie, and it's a hard truth to tell, too, so it's hard to say.  How old's the victim now?  Uh, 39.  Yeah, he's in, like, 30.  30 what?  Went 39, and he got a...  Why would you come forward at 39?  That's fucking weird. 
[01:24:00]  When did he say the abuse took place?  If it didn't happen, maybe he feels like he's comfortable enough to come forward now  with everything else going on out there.  That's what he said.  They did say it started...  He said it started when he was 7, I think.  And the same guy?  I think, yeah.  I mean, it hasn't gotten throughout until he was 39, but the abuse occurred at Fine's home,  Syracuse basketball facilities.  On team road trips, including the 1987 Final Four.  Oh, shit.  And, Tol, keep reading past that.  How long...  Did it say it wasn't extended until? 
[01:24:30]  Or no?  Doesn't...  Okay.  It's not popping out.  I don't think he could be abused for 20 straight years.  That's what I'm saying.  That's a long time.  I think...  I'll give you the first five, maybe?  But somewhere in there, you gotta go, what the fuck, man?  Plus, by the time you're 27, you could probably kick his ass.  It says here somewhere that until he was 27, I'm just trying to find the article.  That's 20 years?  Yeah.  I didn't know Bernie was a Moe!  Yeah, no...  Hey, Moe!  What was that?  What happened? 
[01:25:00]  My template's ripped.  It says Bobby Davis, now 39, told the network, fine, allegedly molested him, beginning in  1984, and that sexual contact continued until he was around 27.  It's weird.  So, really, he raped you as a boy, and then when you were 23, you went over to get some  more dick?  Right.  Oh, boy.  And then when you were 25, you went back for some more dick?  Wow.  And then when you were 26, you said, ah, take a little more dick.  And then when you were 27, you were still getting jerked off?  And then he stopped at 27 because Bernie Fiennes started looking a little too old. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, he put some weight on?  So he's like, fuck that, I'll find someone else to abuse me.  He was a ball boy for six years.  Get the fuck out of here.  So that means, like, for 14 years after that, he had to keep coming back to get his dick tugged  on.  When you're 27, if you're going back when you're 19, 20, for nine more years getting jerked  off, get the fuck out of here.  My pubes are a mess.  They look like the hair on my head.  He's a Moe, a homo, right, Moe?  Stop punching me, Moe. 
[01:26:00]  Where's Bernie Fiennes?  Hey, Bernie, why don't you fuck this?  You fucking freak.  He loved the young boys.  I used to bring my friends over, and he would fuck them all.  You kind of do that very well. 
[01:26:30]  It's pretty amazing.  I want to suck your cock.  I want to suck your cock here in the tree fort.  Hey, Bernie.  What?  Bernie wants to suck my cock in a tree fort.  Richard Fiennes.  I'm going to make believe I'm asleep.  Roll over.  I'll suck your cock.  Why, I ought to... 
[01:27:00]  Bernie Fiennes.  Oh, yes.  It's great.  You horny Jew.  You guys want to hear an amazing, just an amazing Syracuse joke?  Definitely.  Okay.  You sure?  Yeah.  I need a good joke.  Oh, good.  We need a good joke, Steve.  I hear this one's amazing.  Go ahead.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Knock, knock.  Who's there? 
[01:27:30]  Orange.  I didn't hear you said Barnes?  Orange.  Orange.  Orange.  Oh, Orange.  All right.  Start over so we know.  Go ahead.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Orange.  Barnes.  Orange who?  Orange.  No, Jimmy, you missed that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, Steve.  Start over.  I'm sorry.  I can't hear you.  It literally sounds like you're saying Barnes.  No, it's Orange, because they're the Orange men up there.  Not anymore.  All right, let's try this again, Steve.  I'm sorry.  From the top.  Knock, knock.  Who's there? 
[01:28:00]  Orange.  Orange.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, Steve.  We're a little tired from yesterday's broadcast.  All right.  Ready?  Go.  Knock, knock.  Knock, knock.  Oh.  Who's there?  What?  Orange.  No, no, no.  We do the who's there.  We do the who's there.  Or Orange.  Oh, see.  We do the who's there, Steve.  I was going.  Huh?  Okay, I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Steve.  I apologize.  Okay.  Go ahead. 
[01:28:30]  Orange, you're glad you're done.  You got to start over, Steve.  Please.  You want to hold a fucking knock, knock joke.  We're just fucking with you.  I'll Twitter it.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Jimmy will tweet it.  Let's go.  Okay.  Knock, knock.  Boys, I'm in the cornfields of fucking Indiana.  Come on.  Too soon? 
[01:29:00]  Right there.  You kind of need us, don't you?  Yeah.  Right.  You asshole.  I know the joke.  It goes, knock, knock.  Who's there?  Orange.  Orange who? 
[01:29:30]  Orange, you glad Jim Norton to the Borgata January 15th?  That's a good joke, Steve.  You made that up.  Not bad.  I'll try.  Have a good day, boys.  Thank you, man.  We're all going to be wondering Orange who, I think.  Orange, you glad your son didn't go to Penn State.  Oh, Syracuse.  Orange, you glad your son didn't get fucked up the butt.  Orange, you glad you didn't have this.  Oh, really?  Something orange.  I went to Syracuse.  I didn't get fucked.  Of course you did. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, you did.  You just don't know it yet.  I don't recall.  Yeah, you probably.  Oh, you think Carmelo Anthony got fucked?  Oh, hey, huh?  Think he knows this guy or no?  He must.  Why don't you keep your sick dreams to yourself, Sam?  I'm just trying to broadcast you.  I'm just trying to broadcast you.  We're just trying to broadcast you.  Spitballing.  Spitballing.  Do they call that throwing ideas around the room?  Spitballing.  Spitballing.  It says that.  We're just going to see what sticks.  I'd rather sit in a room and snowball with other men.  I saw a news story I want to get some more details on. 
[01:30:30]  They're reopening the Natalie Wood drowning case.  Yep.  Why?  After 30 years.  Did they fucking smash her?  Well.  Is that what they're saying?  They got some new evidence because they're opening up the case 30 years later.  Christopher Walken's involved in this.  Oh!  I do a really good Walken.  He was allegedly with her, maybe in a romantic way.  Um, and she at the time was married to, uh, what's her name there?  Robert Wagner.  Robert Wagner, yes.  Robert Wagner.  Oh!  Oh, you put the watch in your hiney! 
[01:31:00]  Oh!  To a T.  It's good.  I love closing my eyes because I feel like he's in the room.  Yeah, I do.  It's amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  Yes.  Detectives want to talk to the captain of the boat that she was on with, Robert Wagner.  Oh, but is Tennille saying no?  Christopher Walken.  Uh, after learning of comments he recently made about what happened on board.  Oh, what did he say?  I killed him!  Ha ha ha!  I don't see what the comment, uh, co-wrote the book last year. 
[01:31:30]  He made comments worthy of exploring.  Oh!  Oh!  New recollections about the case.  Oh!  I got a recollection!  Recollection.  Wow!  Oh!  Oh!  To recollect this watch!  I killed her in the head with, uh, uh, killed her!  Ha ha ha!  They're going to love you in Harrisburg.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm going to do the walking impression.  I'm going to open it.  They're going to love you.  Why do we Penn State?  That's pretty good.  Oh!  The watermelon catalogue! 
[01:32:00]  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Yeah, that's just breaking, Ant, so we'll have to wait a couple days to see what they're  Something's going on, though.  What they're talking about.  Uh, you want some football picks?  I was always very suspicious.  I would like some picks.  Yes, yes.  My team already played.  That sucks.  Makes for a boring fucking weekend for me.  But we got Mike, uh, Frances on the line.  Mike?  He's a football pick.  Oh, good.  Uh, Mike A!  Hard to follow a knock-knock joke, okay?  But I'm going to try here.  All right, Mike A.  Good morning, Mike Frances. 
[01:32:30]  All right, Mike.  I, uh, rolled over to my left side to let my right side get some blood this morning,  and I heard you review the Jet Bronco game, okay?  And, uh, you did a nice job, Mike.  I have to say, you did a nice job, okay?  Oh, thank you.  Thank you, Mike.  Yes, thank you.  There's no need to touch, uh, touch on a topic.  And maybe you can call Matt and explain space travel to him, okay?  I mean, you guys know nothing about sports.  He's being sarcastic.  I didn't get that part.  I thought it was an actual compliment.  I know.  Damn it.  Okay, no busy show here.  But, uh, it's one of my favorite days of the week, okay? 
[01:33:00]  It is Friday.  And it is football Friday, okay?  So I feel like I'll call and give you guys a little blessings here, okay?  From the Pope of the Pick, okay?  Nice.  Mike Frances.  Make us some money.  That's right.  Call your guy, okay?  Because these picks are locks, okay?  And now, uh, let's do a little Frances and Matthew, okay?  I've been on the air for 25 years, okay?  Roughly every year there's 21 weeks of football, okay?  Including playoffs for Super Bowl, okay?  In that, in that, you multiply them, you get 1,575, okay?  So in my career, I'm 1,575 now, okay? 
[01:33:30]  And we're about to go 1,578 now here, okay?  So the picks, what we call him in the league, where they play, up for pay.  At 1 o'clock, he runs the rings of Saturn, okay?  He throws touchdown passes on Mars, okay?  He's the best quarterback in the universe.  And I'm talking about Mr. Aaron Rodgers, okay?  Tom Brady's the best quarterback in the world.  Aaron Rodgers, best quarterback in the universe, okay?  He's automatic at this point. 
[01:34:00]  He's a 14-point pick.  The line opens up at 14 and a half.  You want to go with the packs, okay?  Wow, all right.  Okay, you take the packs.  Okay, the line's 40, okay?  The line's 50, okay?  The pack's going with 60, okay?  I bank on them, okay?  That's at 1 o'clock.  4 o'clock, okay?  The Miners, the Gold Hamlets, the 49ers of San Francisco, okay?  Went over the Giants last week.  Back in the 90s, when Coach Harbaugh was the quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts,  I said, you know what, in 2011, this guy's going to be a great coach in San Francisco, okay? 
[01:34:30]  I call me a football clairvoyant.  I saw it.  It's happening.  Take the 49ers, okay?  Give the nine points over the Cards.  Game number three.  The late game.  The Philadelphia Eagles and their charcoal-colored quarterback.  At this point, a loss to the Giants here would pretty much end the season for Andy Reid and gang,  and I believe that's exactly what will happen, okay? 
[01:35:00]  I believe in this league, sometimes you think losses, okay, and you learn from those losses, okay?  And I think last week, the Giants lost, okay?  And I learned that you don't learn from the loss, okay?  Look for the Giants to bounce back.  Four and a half, lay it, take it, and put it in the back.  Those are the picks for Week 11 in the NFL.  Wow, good picks.  I like your picks.  Thank you, sir.  Now, quickly, before I hang up, I can't let you guys hold me all day here, okay?  I'm very busy, man.

You did not know that.  I was 250 pounds lighter, okay?  And you can see my Randy Johnson bulging through the front of that white suit, okay?  I think George Revolta was maybe blowing somebody behind the scenes there, and it didn't turn 
[01:36:00]  out, okay?  But I had everything it took, okay?  So I actually have one of the lines here, all right, during my audition here.  I'm going to give it to you now, okay?  This is the scene where I'm at the dinner table with my father, okay?  And I inform him that I had just got a raise.  Yeah.  And my father pooh-poohs the raise.  Yeah, of course he does, yes.  So here it is.  Go ahead and piss on it, okay?  I know you'd piss on it, okay?

[01:43:00]  anything except fuck with people that were working on the subways and i didn't think that i didn't think  that was too smart no that's pretty stupid don't fuck up the working joes you want them to join you  right they're the 99 yeah absolutely yeah they uh did that they got in some fucking brawls with  the cops trying to move some barricades and of course the poster boy for the whole thing is on  the cover of the paper today little bloody head little bloody head matt dylan  doesn't he look like matt dylan yeah he does a little he's all bloody face like ah do it for johnny 
[01:43:30]  he looks like he was really injured at that's that's what i say he was really injured that could  be the littlest cut ever and it's just bleeding no one's really attending to his his injuries i can  only assume they looked at it and said ah don't worry about it looks like a wrestling cut yeah  one of those take a little razor blade and they'll bleed like a motherfucker yeah he was great though  he was crying they're leading him off he's bleeding he's getting arrested and he's just crying 
[01:44:00]  uh you dope i don't know i don't uh i'm trying to get a proper cup of coffee  um yeah but the cops got injured too where are their yeah where are their pictures well they  were taken to the hospital a few cops one was cut with some uh broken glass that was thrown at him  but what why wouldn't the newspaper show that well it's not a good story to try to make the cops look  like uh you know victims cops were well behaved of course they were well they were uh they were 
[01:44:30]  showing the occupy what's the matter it's just cold no it's cold and can't even get a good cup  of coffee oh just a dumb thing don't worry angel don't worry about it jesus sorry sorry sorry the uh  yeah the uh occupy uh they they had a big big day yesterday where they had uh plans and and places  to go they were going to shut down uh wall street and uh a funny tweet i read was was that true 
[01:45:00]  i know what you're about to say yeah yeah it was definitely true uh that they were going to try  and and somebody funny tweet yes somebody thought that they had delayed the opening and that wasn't  some i don't know if it was a joke it didn't seem like a joke and i wouldn't put it past these idiots  to not even know when the fuck the opening bell is on wall street okay uh but yeah somebody was like  hey we did it we delayed the opening a half hour wow and no the the market opens at 9 30 and they  tweeted that i thought it was 9 too everybody thinks it's nine but it opens at 9 30 person 
[01:45:30]  tweeted at 9 11 was it yeah it's like look at us how we're stopping it we're no you're not doing  anything no it's not supposed to open yet you dunce and so they didn't interfere with that at all  and then they were uh going to uh go down in the subways and occupy the subways i don't think that did  much either you know from a selfish point of view i'm really sad that zuccotti park is empty  zuccotti it was it was a good hang down there man was it it really was it was fun i even like 
[01:46:00]  the dumb drum circle yeah yeah and then shut up oh i hate it by the way why aren't they occupying  the subway in brownsville like if they're gonna do that why are they doing it here the bronx would  be have you seen that latest footage of those three black guys and that white guy was it a white guy  beaten up oh yeah is it talked about is that uh no no no it's just you know it's just somebody in  the subway getting punched by other people is that the guy who spoke up when they were being dickheads 
[01:46:30]  uh yeah i think so he was a pretty tough guy right like he's he's not that hurt i think he uh he put  his hand in one of their faces too and shit like oh he started no no the the black guys were starting  it he was just kind of leaning against the door and then uh because they spit or something handed to  him did he get beat up badly oh yeah he was on the ground they were kicking him and stomping on his  head they love the head stomp black guys black guys love when someone's on the ground to just jump  up and stomp on their skulls it really is just a dastardly horrid thing to do to somebody that's 
[01:47:00]  already on the ground unless you know if they raped your moms or something then i can understand  you wanting to stomp their head if they're just on a subway and maybe asked you to uh maybe keep it  down or something uh they don't deserve the head stomp but that's why bernie gets was so great  pulling out a pistol and just fucking shooting those four cocksuckers yo man give me five dollars  i think really and i think you gotta i i don't trust the judicial system no no fuck that no bernie 
[01:47:30]  gets the greatest take care of that situation if you're in a bad bad place that's it another bloody  occupier uh that's the same guy you know what i like is uh the same guy oh that is the same guy  why does his hair look darker on tv i don't know is that the blood or something and the blood and  and then the other one where they're like and they dragged a woman by her hair into the street  and i saw the video and the cops are commenting on it they grabbed her by her backpack  and pulled her into the street out of the crowd so they could arrest her not in a crowd she wasn't 
[01:48:00]  being compliant she wasn't helping the cops in any way so the cops grabbed her by her backpack  and dragged her into the street where they cuffed her and picked her up and she was fine but they're  like shame shame shame shame because they and then they made up the story that they were dragging  her by the hair which they want by the way sam is doing the i'm nervous yawn sam just did the i'm  nervous all right like is coming here he comes right now cm punk oh yeah here he is hey buddy how you

[01:49:30]  no reason why that show should have went away yeah no reason whatsoever the the reason is because the  general population is stupid yeah and we got a lot of complaints about content like too many rape  jokes like they were you know nick to paulo was just fucking as nick and we would just hit a little  bit harder than i guess that they they wanted how about they have a little talk with you guys and  see if you could work something out they tried that in college oh they did i can't imagine that  working i wouldn't think yeah okay it was what it was guys down they wanted they wanted chappelle  to have race john stewart to have politics and us to have pop culture and colin said if i go to

[01:52:00]  mean you know yeah that's stuff is awesome i like hulk renner centered bits that was a great  oh god oh god you need a tv brother hey what what's wrong with troy aikman is he like did he lose his  house or something i know he's doing the renner center commercials with hogan like did he get  divorced did his wife take everything like that's right troy oh boy we brought that up yeah i didn't 
[01:52:30]  know that it's terrible we should have brought that up you're right yeah he has enough money  that's the first thing i think of when i see that yeah what are you doing troy going through a  divorce right yeah it's the first thing i thought yeah he must have some sort of a gambling problem  why hulk is on there after he got everything taken away from his life my favorite hulk moment and you  don't have to comment because i don't know your relationship when he was doing that reality show  and he's going through the divorce and the separation and he was on a boat oh yeah that was  visiting his old waterfront mansion and him and his daughter by the boat and i hate to say this but 
[01:53:00]  him and his daughter are now crying i fucking howled it was the funniest brother my house  brother first world problems first world problems i used to live in that mansion and now i'm looking at  it while i'm on my boat no it was a shitty boat it's a shitty boat which makes it better and then  it's still it's a boat and then it's like and then it's old then it's old dogs want to say hi but  he's not allowed to like go on shore so i'm on my property brother so the dogs are barking 
[01:53:30]  yeah i don't know why that makes us laugh as because other people's misfortune makes it  it really is it just uh it makes you feel better about that stuff happens to me you know yeah i  want to be the first one to laugh at it so you know everyone everyone else is going to laugh at it  i might as well get in on the joke takes the sting out of it a little bit to kind of address it and  own it and make fun of it what's uh now now what what happened uh you you won the title uh-huh uh  and as you said you were going to do left um why are you back um i'm back legitimately and because i'm 
[01:54:00]  i just turned 33 uh i was pretty burnt out for a while because a lot of people don't realize that  i haven't just been doing this since i debuted on tv for wwe in 2006 i've been doing this since 1997  oh wow you know and uh you know obviously i'm doing it on a different level now but i've never  ever ever taken a break ever you know and and the last like two years of my career has been pretty 
[01:54:30]  brutal i'm sure you guys are familiar with the ridiculous travel schedule yeah what we do and like  um last summer i got my uh i got my first surgery yay i had my uh i had my elbow scoped nothing  nothing serious you know but i didn't miss a beat i didn't miss a show i like got my elbow scoped in  birmingham like on a tuesday and i was you know i was at work on on monday you just tell the guys  they kind of watch the elbow yeah you know and it's just like that's just my mentality like you  know wrestlers we're not the smartest guys you know and it's always been like rub dirt on it put tape on 
[01:55:00]  it you know ice it afterwards you're fine and then uh i i i i i affectionately say in october i exploded my  hip i um i tore my gluteus medius tendon which i didn't even know what that was  it apparently attaches my pelvis to uh like some other you know bone i'm gluteus medius so they  told me they told me uh i tore it off the bone and i went to nashville to get surgery and then 
[01:55:30]  thank god the doctor wasn't cut happy and he gave me a pre-op mri and he was like okay i don't know  if you're wolverine or what the deal is and he showed me the first mri he was like torn off the bone  and then he showed me his mri and he's like not torn off oh man kind of crawled back yeah i don't  know and that doesn't happen you know so i was just like well whatever okay so it's like you know  you call back up and he's like oh i'm just gonna do rehab and they're like great see you monday and  i was like wow you're a mutant awesome so is that a wrong mri they showed you you think yeah i don't  know first one yeah pretty weird right yeah maybe a sketchy dog half your ass pretty much fell off yeah 
[01:56:00]  and i don't have much of an ass to begin with so i like to try to hold on to it yeah but yeah i just you  know i never i never had a break so i was i was burnt out and i was legitimately like well i'm  just gonna go home for a while yeah take a rest you know i could afford it you know just and i and  the thing is i wasn't trying to wrestle anywhere else i was i was trying to go home right legit like  sit on my sit on my couch yeah so when you did that promo it was half real i would say it was 100  real i mean i you know that one just looked like a little too honest but that's taking some chances uh 
[01:56:30]  well vint we know vince a little bit he he secretly loves all that well yeah here's yeah here's the  thing and if you guys you kind of knew you could get away with it probably oh yeah if if you whatever  you do is good he doesn't care yeah if it's good he likes it if it makes him money he's happy and i  for some reason have a great radar of what is good and what is bad sometimes sometimes i've been wrong  you know but that's why i love what i do i love live television because i can go out there and i can 
[01:57:00]  do whatever i do you know like whatever they hand me they they hand me a giant script they're like  here go say this and i look at it i'm like this is crap this isn't gonna work and i go out there and i  go in the complete opposite direction and i come back and it's great they're just like yeah whatever  so it works a lot of people would say that the that when you were on the mic that day it was all  you know fake but you're telling us it was partly real well it to me i i liken that to the the  fake chair thing which i still get to this day you know like oh well you know you go how does it 
[01:57:30]  feel you know how does it feel when you guys hit each other with a fake chair and i'm like wait what  the is a fake chair is it a figment of my imagination like i don't understand you know like what  all right all right no it's a genuine chair we we know that yeah they said wrestlers back in the day  would actually cut themselves with a razor to get to make it bloodier i learned i respected them more for  for that i'm like you voluntarily cut your fucking head with a razor most ridiculous thing you've  ever heard yeah like that's just that's showmanship yeah yeah that's an illness that's not 
[01:58:00]  showmanship that's ridiculous you know you never cut yourself have i yeah i've done it  yeah yeah you were all you know right around the hairline i hear is the best place right  yeah but how do you tell when you're doing it you're just like ah  yeah yeah you know and then get repeatedly in that oh it's fucking crazy nothing better when  the wrestlers were bleeding when we were growing up you're like the whole the whole canvas would 
[01:58:30]  just be covered you know some of the old school guys like harley race they know how to bust your  eyebrow open that's really that's really intense well they know how to just fucking yeah he tried to do  it to me one time just because like i'm i'm sick in the head and i'm so infatuated with like the old  school and like you know the tradition and stuff like that and i'm friends with harley and he was  um i think he was managing somebody or something like that i've done shows for harley and i was  just like yeah do my eyebrow yeah do it you know like i was like this is great it's harley race he's 
[01:59:00]  gonna do my eyebrow yeah and he just wound up like punching me in the face a bunch of times like  nothing happened all of a sudden you realize there's no real secret behind it he's just punching you in  the face until you bleed yeah i don't even think i bled it was really disappointing uh and puddle  of aids writes aikman just got divorced so there's your answer there's your answer sorry sorry troy  so now you you come back yeah and uh where do you stand now with uh with wwe and uh what's your 
[01:59:30]  position there um you know it i mean it's funny because you know like i was just anti-establishment  guy and everybody latched on to what i said and then i turned around and i went back so of course  there was people that were like oh you're a sellout right right and this and that but like i i had a  lot of uh wise people that i talked to about you know should i resign should i go away what should i  do and i i i got a good support system and um one of the wisest things i was told was you can't 
[02:00:00]  change the place for for the better or for the worse sitting on your couch and uh i i still am a  sucker for professional wrestling uh and i i think it hasn't been as good as it can be yeah you know  and i'm you know i'm slowly but surely you know making steps to i guess ensure that in 20 years  there's still pro wrestling whether people like it or not you know because i i do get spooked sometimes  that maybe the you know this isn't going to be around does mma scare you with that like the the 
[02:00:30]  especially with brock going over no i love mma you do yeah i'm a huge mma guy yeah and i i i  embrace mma and i think a lot of people who don't um i i i who don't think it's our our competition  uh i think they're kind of scared of it you know how many days a year do you wrestle  uh that is a that is a great question i don't know i probably every week right well yeah no it's it's  it's every week i mean my normal schedule is you know friday saturday sunday monday um i'd say 50 
[02:01:00]  percent of the year i do tuesdays and then we have we have international tours where you know  i just got back from europe we did 12 12 days straight in europe huge in europe yeah i asked  because uh like you said earlier we talked to a lot of you guys and the schedule kills you yeah and i i  just wonder if you have to still do that type of schedule in nowadays um do you have to really do  that many local shows because those are the ones that aren't on tv or anything yeah that's my bread and  butter i i love it it is uh we're we're supposed to call them live events now but oh not house 
[02:01:30]  shows live events right you know and that that's my bread and butter that's where you know i'm not  constrained by you know uh commercial breaks or you know tv time and stuff like that i get to do it  really a lot oh my god is it fun but vince feels like he still has to have that type of a schedule for  his uh company huh yeah yeah well i think it's i think it's important to you know like hit i i there's a  lot of time there's a lot of places i think we we oversaturate you know because we're we're infamous  for finding something that's good and we just beat the hell out of it it's like oh mexico is really 
[02:02:00]  good for us right now oh we're gonna go and then you know the next thing you know a year later you're  like wow these mexico shows aren't drawn so good well you just did we were just talking we just did  monterey six days in a row you know yeah we were talking about the same thing yeah they're  killing each other down there yeah mexico is frightening man oh it's pretty brutal what do they  do when you go down there do you stay in a secure hotel or do you have military guards uh we when we  did monterey which i guess is uh you know really shady it's not juarez level shady right it's up there 
[02:02:30]  yeah um we flew in uh on a charter and had like just i don't even i don't know if they were military  but they had guns yeah they were they were strapped yeah every like everything they had ankle pieces and  you know one guy had a shotgun in it you know and then they they escorted us to the show and like  these you know jeeps on either side and then right after the show escort right back on the charter fly  out so we didn't fly right out we didn't even stay in monterey okay so you know you know it's you know 
[02:03:00]  it's hot when they get scared of uh kidnappings and stuff one of you guys would be pretty valuable i  think yeah i wouldn't be worried about one of us i'd be worried about one of the girls yeah that too  all right well but they would probably go i'll be honest they would probably take one of the guys  for the money that's why giuliani went down he brought his own he wouldn't let me he didn't  trust mexican security he brought his own guys yeah yeah he went yeah it's just a sense frightening  time yeah i remember one time we were in like panama city or something like that and they were  literally like do not leave the hotel and then um uh bless her heart sweet kelly kelly was like i want 
[02:03:30]  to go to hooters i was just like no what is you know and there was like a hooters like literally like  maybe three blocks away from the hotel and she's like come to hooters with me and i was just like  you're gonna get killed so i wound up going to hooters with her and i was just like this is  yeah i was like this isn't this isn't good what was wrong with it when you went you felt people  well there were no street lights and we were we were walking and they were just like you know 
[02:04:00]  i mean it was like a movie there were just people like behind pillars like looking at us and i was  just like yeah yeah i'm about to get killed for a shitty chicken wing but i went you know  i think jonathan went that's where is that where roberto duran is from uh panama he is right he's  panamanian i'm trying to think where duran is from because jonathan just went there he actually he  knows roberto and he said it was very frightening like with him you're fine but he goes without it  he said you'd probably be killed but you gotta explain that uh cm punk just my manager travels 
[02:04:30]  this guy's crazy everywhere and the worst place in the world he goes and he knows somebody who  knows roberto duran so he was actually down there with him that's very fun and he likes to go to  bad places yeah he's a weird guy yeah for some reason really bad places i get that i don't know  it is kind of adventurous when you think of indiana jones-ish kind of thing to do but yeah then you  think of the reality it's like oh i can actually be killed and well it's like we we go to iraq you  know we went to iraq like i mean for eight years in a row you know on christmas and yeah you know you  think that's safe oh you're fine you're with the military you know we you know vince we need to go to the 
[02:05:00]  forward most operating bases and we need to do that and like i was on a base and the oldest marine  was like 21 years old it was like a it was like a base they're all just giant fans you're like oh  my god fans are watching it was unbelievable and i was like okay well what's the you know and they're  like don't don't stick your head up above the the fence oh there's a big concrete fence and of course  i was like oh great so there's there's clearly you and i was like what's on the other side of the 
[02:05:30]  fence and they're like fallujah good i'm gonna stick my head up brother all right great we get  it i went over there with colin went to iraq uh between between seasons one and two i think yeah  and uh we got mortar bombed i didn't even know it we me and dummies slept through the whole thing  the next day they're like a fucking mortar landed in the base yeah but we had no idea that it happened  we just fucking slept through it yeah that happened to us too the one year like you know we're just like  hanging around and like all of a sudden yeah i was like what was that oh that was like a rocket 
[02:06:00]  on board oh someone tried to kill us that's basically what that was somebody fired a weapon  to kill you yeah have you gone to afghanistan uh yeah the one year we went there and uh this year  we're doing um i i don't i don't want to say last year i think was camden yeah  actually the last time we were in camden we were we were ready to leave and then they wouldn't let  us leave uh the the show they said shots fired yeah yeah you gotta it is in in some cases worse 
[02:06:30]  than iraq or afghanistan yeah camden new jersey lovely place shots fired don't stick your head  up watch for the mortar sam's chomping at the bit to get some i'm enjoying the interview but you're  chomping at the bit to get some wrestling stuff done sam you gotta get some wrestling stuff done  well i was gonna add based on what you said before you said you know you go out there and do your  thing and sometimes usually it works but sometimes it doesn't like what hasn't worked um oh you put  me on the spot what a dumb question oh man damn he's against us exactly we're trying to lift 
[02:07:00]  the shit out you know wallet creep nothing nothing super specific like burning out his candle i don't  know if anything on tv i i that i can name off the top of my head but that's what the house shows are  for i go out there and i just i do stuff you work to try shit out yeah you hannibal lecto with that  question what is your worst wrestling memory the the the straight edge society stuff to me like  it didn't work because they they didn't uh they didn't fully get behind it like to me that was  the best stuff i've ever done because i was doing like this borderline like evil sacrilegious stuff 
[02:07:30]  that i just kept i just kept slipping on tv and like everyone was missing all this stuff like i had  stigmata on my hands and like i was doing like all this creepy like greats i just didn't care i was  like i want to offend every i had i had an old woman like this grandma assault me uh in alabama  she leaned over the rail and she said uh you are not to jesus christ and you will burn in hell for  your sins and then she hit me with the left hook and i and i and i just i leaned over i grabbed the  microphone and i said i forgive you and like hands on her and like so do you get mad when that happens 
[02:08:00]  or you're like oh what a great moment no i'm i'm i'm completely mental like i i'm i'm so in tune  with like you know like the the old school guys used to get stabbed and you know like that was  always my goal like to me to me when i'm stabbed to me when i'm the bad guy like that's the thing like  i you know i'm the bad guy yeah you know i want my tires flashed set my car on fire like i want i i  really go for it with that said uh what was the worst thing that happened i don't i don't think the 
[02:08:30]  old lady giving you left the left hook was the worst thing no i've i've gotten uh i mean pre-wwe  like i i had i had gotten into a lot of a lot of fights with fans and stuff like that um i used to  i mean you know when you're on the indies and i was doing the straight edge thing in 1999 i would  wrestle frequently in a knights of columbus in uh west allis wisconsin and the big the big draw was  like they had you know one dollar beers or whatever so this place would be packed with 500 drunk people 
[02:09:00]  no guard rails no nothing and then here's this skinny straight edge kid i'm drug free i'm alcohol  free i'm better than you and there's no guard rails people would start throwing beers and i would just  jump out of the ring and just you know i would just i would just chase people down the street like you  know that was yeah yeah it turned into like it got really bad after a while where the promoters  would be like please stop beating up fans uh almost started a riot in the cow palace the last time i was  there like um because that's that's the great thing about wrestling the undertakers when the 
[02:09:30]  lights go out the crowd gets really brave yeah and the light you know so people's you know doing  the normal throwing pennies and and batteries and you know whatever they you know next thing you know  a chair comes into the ring and somebody else gets brave and thinks it's great i think it's on youtube  actually it's pretty it's you turn our screen on sam it's pretty great yeah sam what are you thinking  of only you hey do you uh have you always been drug free or did you did you do it oh you really  never stopped wow this is the tattoo says drug free yes sir so i thought maybe you quit your whole life 
[02:10:00]  yeah never had a drink um i i think maybe i had like a sip of beer when my dad was cutting the grass  or something like that yeah it never interested you no nothing no wow no addictive vices at all like  you're one of those guys some guys just don't get hooked on stuff i i'd say i probably i'm addicted to  stuff i just don't you know nothing that's like you know mind-altering or right oh yeah yeah and i  hear you it's probably a good fuck on the same websites yeah there was an awareness there between 
[02:10:30]  jimmy and cm bug yeah yeah communicating without words right there is this the uh almost riot that  that might be the almost riot yeah and i was really i was really trying you know yeah give me an inch i i  will try to take a mile and like uh  do you want to take her obviously 
[02:11:00]  a lot of samoans in the cow palace too so i probably yeah it's certainly not a ride i would  have won it's a really long clip unfortunately yeah skip ahead um i i i can't remember what the match  was i do know i was tagging with chris jericho and uh i mean you see people just now they're  throwing stuff yeah there's one gangster part where somebody actually throws something right  at me and i catch it it's like a dennis eckersley sidearm i just catch it nice like i'm obi-wan or 
[02:11:30]  something um no but i jericho was throwing a fit like he was legit like stop throwing things they're  throwing things and he ran to the back like he oh really couldn't hack it i think he got i think he got  hit with a d battery or something like that uh we only have a couple minutes left with cm i'm here  yeah and we got to talk about survivor series at the very least yes you can keep the clip going  in the background i'm apologizing to everybody that i'm i know i'm supposed to be uh selling on  everybody on survivor series but this is this is just fun for me man i would love to stay all day 
[02:12:00]  you know you guys get real sick of me fast though no no not at all doubt that you seem like you're  our kind are you in new york for a while you're leaving yeah no no no i'm staying okay they wanted  to fly me back home and then fly me back out and i was just like what no yeah i hate flights i hate  people i hate airports i hate i hate tsa are you wearing are you wearing a belt uh shut up  championship belt you yeah yeah so yeah survivor series this sunday madison square garden yeah i'm  taking on alberto del rio for the wwe title it's gonna be pretty awesome yeah absolutely are you 
[02:12:30]  going sam yeah i'll be there of course as uh professional or are you going as a right now  just a spectator but i'm seeing if there's any are you working on uh seeing who needs management  and sam would love to work i thought maybe as the press no no no don't they pay you here  he got some mere pittance yeah to work here and uh boy is he looking for that wwe gig he wants to 
[02:13:00]  work for wwe and he wants to be sammy the twink and i'm like that's just it's not going to be a  sellable character yeah are you nervous before these matches are you uh it's not like a dumb  question but hey you know what it is it isn't it isn't it's like you know um i'm sure you'd be able  to relate like any you know like i do this so frequently that i actually i get excited if i get  like it'll dawn on me like oh whoa i'm getting nervous oh this is great you know like i still love  this you still you still care yeah yeah um because there there's there was a while when i was just 
[02:13:30]  like i was just a robot i was just like oh here we go another you know and it was it was kind of  unfortunate because it's like you know like i always wanted to be on pay-per-view and it was just like  after a while i was like oh another pay-per-view right yeah but i i always and this was the the whole  genesis of me re-signing was it's like look you're you're either going to use me  to my capacity which to me is you know uh on top of everything and i can produce or you know you're 
[02:14:00]  you're not and if you're not like if you want to pay me millions of dollars and you know not use me  that's cool but i'm more happy when you know like i'm actually doing stuff and i'm busy and i'm doing  stuff like this and you know like i mean i i've been home you know two days this month already just two  whole days you know but i if if i'm if i'm out there and i'm doing stuff and i'm on top and i'm  producing and it's fun and it's a good tv and it's entertaining i'm happy two days yeah two days what  do you what do you do in those hotel rooms to make the time go by or or in these cities do you do 
[02:14:30]  anything do you go out dude i like you know i i'm very fortunate that i get to go see the world and  uh you know so you take advantage the unfortunate part is you don't really get to see the world you  see inside the hotels or buses or you know planes or whatever but uh yeah like last night i got in  i got to my hotel and i just i took off yeah hit the street and just walked around what's going on  you know nice i mean it's new york so it's you know yeah well new york's an easy one i'm talking  about like des moines iowa or where the fuck i like i i work out too much so i like to go running so a 
[02:15:00]  lot of times i'll something i relate to less we gotta get him out yeah he has to go  we have a bunch of copies of wwe 12 that we're going to get to callers that i think punk is  signing the new game yes i'll be signing brock lesnar's on the cover right he's not on the cover  but he's in the game he's in the game yeah i knew there was some kind of a a thing with that yeah all  right cm punk survivor series live on pay-per-view this sunday and at cm punk on twitter yes that is me

[02:16:00]  so  brian regan in studio it's been way too fucking long oh yeah how are you brian i'm doing good how 
[02:16:30]  are you guys we're doing good as well good still here still here just going through the motions 
[02:17:00]  at this point at this point we're like your old teachers ah boy we just stay in one place and you  guys travel the world and come back and visit your old high school still still here huh oh you're  still teaching uh social studies 20 years later yep the going through the motions that would uh  sound good in a job interview yeah yeah you know you hire me i'll come in and i'll go through  the motions for you that would be just a bad thing to do on a job interview you looking for somebody to  go through the motions i'm your man show me some of the motions and i'll just go through them every 
[02:17:30]  day i'll memorize them and i'll do them uh i won't even think about them i'll just do them on a daily  basis yeah go through them we're still having it we're still having a good time though yeah i hear you  guys all the time man i put you guys on when i'm driving around yes but i have a little chip i can  take all the bad words out yeah oh you do yeah that's interesting yeah never heard of that must you  you must not get much uh air time from us i'll hear the yeah and have a good week 
[02:18:00]  where uh are you playing in the area or uh well i came in yesterday to do uh the letterman show  last yes david letterman and that was a big show to do too because the regis philbin was on falling  off that vespa that everyone's talking about yeah they taped uh two shows last night the first one was  with uh regis philbin who uh yeah did the vespa thing and then they were they taped the second 
[02:18:30]  show which uh i was supposed to be on oh what happened well i showed up and said i'm here to go  through the motions like i usually do next thing you know i was out on the street no i got i got bumped  the old bumper rooney uh who bumped you though herman cain well he didn't bump me but i mean herman  kane went you know but you want to you want to face though you want to know who bumped you hey you  know letterman was having a good time interviewing him and uh i i kind of i i saw it coming you know 
[02:19:00]  what i mean you get a feeling were you looking and going oh boy they're just going too long i should  have just started taking off my like uh my jacket and tie before you even come in and go don't even  bother telling me i already know you got the little baby wife you're taking your makeup off  yeah yeah what what do you want gotta awkwardly call the wife uh tell the kids i can be on yeah  yeah just unset the dvr unset it unset it yeah we want to see angry fried ring not this it's okay 
[02:19:30]  i got bumped it happens yeah forget it party has got to be a little disappointed brian a little bit  they invite him back though it's not like he gets bumped it doesn't bother me it doesn't bother me at  all if you're already there why doesn't letterman do a little extra time he tapes your segment and  then airs it next week because the suit he's wearing will be different when he introduces you  who cares no but they can't and it might not be topical make sure he wears the same suit that day  no all right that's fine why though brian's just the uh perpetual nice guy though i know i don't 
[02:20:00]  really mind getting bumped when you've done 20 how many 26 23 we've done 23 you know you're coming  back like it happened free airfare free hotel it's like what the fuck your frequent flyer miles  that would be a little douchey if he got really pissed off at the fact that he was bumped after  doing his show 20 some odd times that's bullshit dave i demand a meeting with dave right now  don't we were friends dave you stand in the hallway when he's walking you don't let him go up those 
[02:20:30]  stairs yes he loves going up those stairs i'm not taking this anymore mr letterman that bumped me  what did uh herman cain have to say anything about the uh sexual uh harassment and well i mean it  hasn't aired so i mean it's airing tonight so i don't know oil it but uh but yeah dave letterman  asked him about that let him have it yeah yeah i mean say dave letterman asked about that stuff  yeah right it was funny that brian didn't just say letterman he went dave letterman asked him about  that mr david letterman  that's why they they will invite me back because i i treat him as a god yeah he's a good interviewer 
[02:21:00]  letterman man he's yeah yeah and he wasn't uh throwing softballs there huh no no i mean you  know i i think the first segment was kind of light-hearted you know talk about pizzas and stuff  like that yeah yeah kind of reign them in and then the next thing you know it's like what about these uh  sexual harassment things and i'm like wow wow so uh yeah but it was fair i mean dave was fair he asked  fair questions and herman cain hung in there and it was fun to watch well the new thing if you 
[02:21:30]  weren't bumped they would have asked you the same question so the sexual harassment thing brian  but the new thing with herman cain is the foreign policy thing he doesn't think a president should  have to know that stuff and he makes a point of not knowing about it it's uh very oh it's hard to  watch sometimes when he talks about actually he actually said that what did he say he doesn't think  the president should have to know much about foreign policy what he's doing is he's trying to own  his weakness because he's not good at that he's trying to make it hit it's almost like when i 
[02:22:00]  talk about my fat tits i own it so it's harder to hit me with it and that's what he does hit you with  your own tits yes unless i'm doing jumping jacks or stepping off a curb and herman cain talked about  his fat tits too he'll do that but yeah i think you're right jim i i think uh he's gonna get if he tries  to pretend like he does no foreign policy then they're going to keep asking him more questions about  it and for him to just say hey i don't know anything about it then if he trips up again  they're like hey i told you i didn't know anything about it i told you that from jump  street i don't know nothing about nothing i know pizza though but he's still got to get votes in 
[02:22:30]  the end that's a terrible thing i don't understand foreign policy you're never going to win the  election that's a rough one man it does create an uphill battle that's for sure yeah you think he backs  out of the race he's had a tough month well he's at 13 now but you think he just some of the  polls that doesn't mean anything because those things go back and no it's crazy newt gingrich is  at the top he's the boy today yeah and then after a while he won't be the top guy it's just who's on  top uh at on election day hanging in there gingrich will get knocked off he's way too conservative 
[02:23:00]  for people i'm telling you it's almost like they they they keep boosting these guys as the election  gets closer just because they boost one guy the whole time shit will come out so they keep boosting  these other these little bubbles just to keep you occupied i'm not being paranoid conspiracy  guy but i really think that it's going to be uh romney or uh uh i'm guessing it's romney yeah i  think he'll get the i think it's like when you go to those shooting arcades and you know the the  ducks keep coming around in a circle yeah and you keep pinging the one off the top that that's the  way it is with the republican candidates you know you get a duck up at the top and the media just pings 
[02:23:30]  him off and then that one goes down and then romney comes back up and then you know i like that  that's hilarious man you're just like yeah  here it is hold on i gotta work my foley system 
[02:24:00]  i love the length of time between the shot and when the duck goes down  there's like a three-minute delay for that very long range yeah that's some good that's some good  shooting man  that's the longest target game ever  what else has brian been up to it's been a long time well i'm working uh i'm working on a new pamphlet  a pamphlet yeah all right what's it about so uh well you know it's uh we're probably not going to 
[02:24:30]  make it color because that apparently is you know kind of expensive yeah yeah and uh we were going to  do like the three page fold out thing the trifold yeah but that's a little expensive so it's probably  just going to be a two-sided uh black and white pamphlet you know just one of some sort yeah like  uh exactly like a xerox ditto kind of thing so we're working on that right now all right 
[02:25:00]  things are going well well brian cd we're in the talks i should say i mean i don't want to guarantee  yeah i don't want to it's in the pipeline pamphlet  november 25th all by myself his new cd is coming out and he uh what he was meant to be promoting it  on letterman but we all know what happened there apparently did something yeah but uh  yeah and december 10th state theater new brunswick december 11th state theater in  ithaca new york still happy to see my friend only doing theaters while i go to harrisburg and do the 
[02:25:30]  comedy zone i'm really happy to see brian doing fucking 2500 seats consistently that's awesome but  great comedian obviously well thank you new cd i can't wait for that how many cds do you have out  uh two cds and three dvds look it's just all the same you know you just do the same jokes over and  over again go through the motions it's just package it differently it's all about fooling the public  little brown one is pluto  just switch it up a little bit and it seems like a different brian 
[02:26:00]  sounds like a guy at the end of his career i'm seeing a lot of merchandising  he's ready to oh my god is that all your stuff that's great well like colin would say that's  like a turkish bazaar we've actually you know it's weird about five six years ago the only thing i would  allow was actual comedy whether it was a cd or a dvd and then i got talked into doing t-shirts and now  look now look snuggies yeah you got snuggies you too and take luck snuggies and i got winter hats and 
[02:26:30]  i i think i got a golf umbrella maybe it's a brian reagan golf umbrella official store a take  luck wool hat yeah yeah man that's one of those hippie hats if you're gonna go to a party you know  you want one of those things yeah is that a bumper sticker i see bumper stickers uh look at you brian  can i say you're fucking reagan it's a you too it's like an older bit but literally every time i've  said you too about have a good flight you too you think of reagan it's one of those really weird 
[02:27:00]  you you now are that is yours ingrained man i i i was at an airport about six months ago  and the uh no way this is true and the reservationist gave me the the my ticket  and she said have a nice flight and i said you too and then i said oh wow that was stupid to her  and she goes oh don't worry about it people do that all the time and i'm like oh no you don't  understand who i am it was really stupid how stupid this really is really stupid coming from 
[02:27:30]  me yeah and then there's a little the little teeny part is regan would have thought that she knew who  he was and would just get it with him but then she's like what why would that be stupid oh yeah  never mind oh you're the guy that does that i was in an elevator um in a hotel no way yes this is  true yeah up or down quick i'm in an elevator and there's a guy in there who recognizes me  and he he tries to do the youtube bit to me but he messes it up he goes he goes oh you're the guy 
[02:28:00]  that does the uh the uh and you right oh so i'm just flattered that the guy even knows who i am so  i'm not going to call him on it so i said yeah yeah that's me he goes oh man i say that all the time  i always say and you and you and i'm like man this is awkward elevator door opens we're walking  through the casino and so he thinks it's going to be funny to yell what he thinks is my bit to me so  he's yelling and you and you and i'm thinking i'm the only guy who knows what he's talking about and i 
[02:28:30]  don't know what he's talking about what a fool but you don't want to correct him right no you're not  gonna correct him oh the poor guy that's very funny good look at all the merchandise it's pages  but you know what that guy's gonna watch brian's cd again or dvd again and he's gonna go what why  didn't that motherfucker oh man i think he's gonna get all hot in the face he should be like  embarrassment weeks later yeah he's probably like listening to this interview going oh my god that was 
[02:29:00]  me holy shit i'm an idiot he noticed and he hates me for it i want to know i want to know how brian  worked in the big yellow one is the sun into merchandise where is it where is it wow where is  it come on it's in the uh iphone skin oh your iphone skin i don't know brian's just like i don't know  go to the faberge eggs brian's just like i'm just trying to pay the rent i gotta pay a mortgage job 
[02:29:30]  you're still in vegas yes yeah yeah yeah how's that how's the family uh you know all right all  right enough there it's always it's always very uh very scary asking that question yeah of people  i don't you know everything you know it is what it is you move along in life that's good  that's what you do yeah there's some changes some changes in my world but uh everything is good you  know the kids i i don't mind that at all i've made some changes in my life so accordingly are you 
[02:30:00]  depressed about it no no everything is hunky dory i like i like brian as a hunky dory  in fact i had that worded into the divorce decree yeah it says hunky dory in there in several  paragraphs you cannot uh say that i don't feel hunky dory about this in public now we understand  actually it was a very amicable amicable situation so yeah you know it's just one of those things 
[02:30:30]  i'm sure oh my god the brian oh hence the merchandise that's what i was gonna say  now we understand why all the merchandising i should sell a hunky dory t-shirt  hey get me a hunky dory t-shirt call my merchandise guy  but then it's a picture of brian with a pistol and just two female feet sticking out  jesus no that's not hunky dory at all that's who it is oh it's not even close to hunky dory  no no no it's all good uh you know obviously without delving uh into uh how long is how long

[02:32:00]  good wouldn't amiable work as well i think it would no amiable doesn't work why why i didn't i didn't know  it oh it was amiable and amicable amicable and it was like a little thing where you sit together with  um a mediator kind of thing and work it all out and we we we didn't disagree on a lot of things  it's cool it all worked out mine was uh mine was more like a war yeah it was a battle a battle  that didn't end for three years no yeah yeah we didn't go that route it was terrible yeah mine i i 
[02:32:30]  think it's like wow my divorce lasted as long as like star trek the original series like and there  was a lot of episodes you had a lot of episodes during your divorce proceedings oh there was certainly  a lot of episodes some great episodes but then once it's done you're kind of like all right it's done  uh i know i had to uh uh for for nine years after that i had to pay a lot of money for nine years i am  only imagining the pain that brian regan feels having to do these gigs hence the u2 snuggies 
[02:33:00]  oh that's hilarious  you too  brian what can we do anything i've ever said  put it on clothing  put it on fucking clothes  coffee cups bumper stickers  it doesn't matter i have skins i don't give up  you can fit that bit on a sock 
[02:33:30]  put a yellow mark on a hospice pillow  oh god wow  oh good the little little things for jogging  water bottles  because i jog all the time you know i only promote things that i use myself  of course what has now because because you what have you have you had anything i've had a few  jesus ask the question shithead have you had anything that just didn't sell at all that you thought  might i've done all that stuff on there 
[02:34:00]  oh brian oh boy i've been in the warehouse there's just rows and rows and just piles of  merchandise it's like that warehouse at the end of indiana jones exactly  wield the ark of the covenant only with regan merchandise it is amazing when you think  something's gonna be a hot item and you realize no one is clamoring for this item  oh jesus so brian have you have you have you started uh dating and stuff like that because  that's got to be kind of a new experience uh not new experience but you know it's been 
[02:34:30]  yeah i haven't done it in a while i would gather uh you know right now i'm just uh  concentrating on the the little tykes yeah well that's the important part obviously how old  are they from what 12 and 8 yeah okay yeah that's like uh imperative i know my parents  handled the divorce fantastically just shitting on each other anytime i was in earshot one would  shit on the other uh and then realizing that they were both absolutely right 
[02:35:00]  dad was a drunk and mom was a fucking raving bitch lunatic yes i understand now uh and like  the golf umbrella the golf umbrella is fantastic terrific it's yeah i can't now this is it's right  this is i was i was talking to my manager about this stuff and we were joking because we're actually  going to pull some of the stop stuff off and i said do those golf umbrellas sell and he said he said  that he we've sold four and i said four and he goes yeah and i bought them all 
[02:35:30]  i don't know i don't know you know that's not bad if you only made five you gotta run it up the  flagpole and see who you gotta see you know you know you gotta you gotta spitball some of these  things sometimes and see what sticks i just i love the fact that he's got all this merchandise  because again it people will buy it it's just it won't sell as fast as you think but there's so many  options people who are big fans will buy a lot of it i thought it was a great idea to uh to uh 
[02:36:00]  put out some t-shirts i i i do this live from the compound thing from my basement and i set up a giant  real studio in my basement and i i go on there and i talk about the news and i run video clips and  stuff it's video and audio and i was like you know what i should put out t-shirts for this so i i  ordered a bunch of t-shirts that are a little controversial the logo on the um on the uh  breast area sort of resembles a symbol of hate throughout history show it to brian and see what 
[02:36:30]  he thinks yeah but it's it's not it's an sort of resembles a symbol of hate i can sort of i  i don't think i can imagine it's an l and an f but don't hold back from the compound live from the  compound the l and the f are connected together there's the logo i got you see it's an l and an  f and then the compound who wants to explain that as a jewish fist is fucking crashing in your jaw  that's about it eighty percent of of the most vile symbol yes but let me tell you something 
[02:37:00]  but it's not a hundred percent and unless it's a hundred percent then it isn't it exactly if you  take a crucifix and break off the arms it's merely a fence post yeah but if you open up something  called the ku klux clam house everybody knows what you're going for that's a great idea i so i got  that and on the back it's uh me uh uh holding uh a gun and saying talk motherfucker uh because i did  that once uh when my phones were down i thought the caller was screwing with me and not talking so i did 
[02:37:30]  draw a gun pointed it at the camera and yelled talk motherfucker talk uh and that's the back of  the shirt uh but here's the problem i didn't think about logistics how this gets sent out how it gets  packaged so i wind up getting boxes and boxes of t-shirts to my house and all these orders start  coming in and i'm like uh don't they just go out no i had to sit there and i'm printing labels 
[02:38:00]  and yet peeling them off sticking them on plastic bags literally sitting on my living room shoving  t-shirts into plastic bags why didn't you think it through i just thought hey i'll sell t-shirts  hey not knowing i'd be sitting there and then he's fucking bagging them and then i'm at the post office  with dog boxes and the post uh guy is going uh there's not enough postage on these you didn't print  up the labels right i go well what do i do he goes hold on he comes out with a shitload of stamps 
[02:38:30]  now i'm sitting in the post office putting an extra stamp on every one of hundreds of bags  of of shirts in the post office peeling stamps i want to do it for you i have i know i need a mexican  i don't know what to do i so so i've just been bagging these myself not realizing uh that you  know this just doesn't get done when you order the shirts we have another guest yeah to join the  program brian's not going anywhere no no brian in a while we're not kicking brian out of here brian's 
[02:39:00]  our guests right we're not bumping brian you're gonna bring it right in or do you want to take a  break is uh yeah no if we don't need a break let's keep going so we can get the fuck out early okay  we're getting out of here early today brian fuck that break shit bring herman kane in  oh sorry brian that would be a little awkward  it'd be hysterical if he walks in yeah all right see you later hi hi oh my god you are pretty  oh yeah that's crazy she's not a she's not a comic all right now she's over do you know brian

[02:40:00]  were don't get bumped no i don't don't everyone's favorite retarded grandpa yeah don't bring up  herman kane in front of me do you love him no no i i was supposed to do letterman last night but i  got bumped because for herman kane yeah for someone that will never ever get the nomination exactly  exactly so brian was supposed to work for him at one point and herman yank just cocked out in the  car does that happen yeah but nobody believed me yeah so when i complained about a water bottle 
[02:40:30]  and he said  herman kane pulled my wiener get your herman kane pulled my wiener and  fucking snuggies and please buy some beach umbrellas yeah has anyone you guys ever eaten a  godfather's pizza no i've never had a godfather's pizza you no i don't think anyone has i don't  think that's like i don't think it's real i don't think it's an italian pizza guy where do they sell  that what if you do research and find out there is no godfather's pizza it is just a big problem  i think just because it's hacky like oh mafia and pizza hey oh he'll make you a slice you can't 
[02:41:00]  refuse all right you hack i feel like he what is he he harasses women yeah he says things he doesn't  understand and he sings he's pretty much like a crazy homeless person like there's no difference  he dresses like a jackass that's exactly what they do yes but that doesn't disqualify him no you  gotta think he harassed some women right yeah i would hope so he absolutely gotta think there's  just been too many allegations for it to not be true i you know you want to give everyone the 
[02:41:30]  benefit of the doubt if one person pops up but yeah you know four ladies hasn't everyone harasses  women everyone so if he had just owned up and be like yeah rap women yeah what'd i do that's how  i roll okay i think uh just said look i'm black yeah yeah stop it i'd do it i think i think also he  was harassment it's called harassment now back uh in the day i called the day he uh it was just called  trying to pick up on a girl like he's in the car with her this one girl told this whole thing in the 
[02:42:00]  car they're driving he puts his hand on her leg moves it towards her vagina uh she says now you could go  from knee to two inches above the knee technically the hands moving toward the vagina but it's not  even within radar range of of uh said but as an owner of a vagina yes for most of my life all right  you're more qualified than us well you might own it but i've done nothing but try to get into one  my whole life it's a very not for her against her but it's a it's a very it's a sensitive area your 
[02:42:30]  thigh and your inner thigh so anything over there you always get nervous yeah but but she  said to stop he then stopped and drove her home it wasn't like it was also moving towards her  hat right toward her mind yeah he was trying to move all the way up and and communicate with her 
[02:43:00]  mind depending on how far he wanted to go right yeah he could have pulled that move too at the  end he didn't have to go to vagina there's a move where you go up the leg but then you're like yeah  i'll turn and go up the hip yeah i understand the girl is that what's it called it's a it's called  turn and go up the hip it's like it's in all the manuals as you're moving flanking the asshole  as you're moving up the thigh a little bit you could tell if a girl wants you to continue or take the uh 
[02:43:30]  off-ramp to the hip by crying and yes she starts crying no daddy daddy no screaming no loudly yes  and then you you turn and go up the uh the thigh i think in something your minds right now you're  like so if she doesn't want me to go for a vagina then i'll just go to her butthole  what's it gonna be the ass or the vagina clearly she can't be not interested at all  i have a feeling uh brian reagan's gonna have a new shirt now because 
[02:44:00]  vagina or ass i'm a two-holer okay put that on a golf umbrella it's on my new my new drink tumblers  oh you're the best i love brian how long have you had to watch up brian no i i you're we're  we're diverting attention from a very very funny woman here and i'm looking forward to uh jimmy  fallon tonight yeah that's cool that's awesome all right you were on last comic i would i won it 
[02:44:30]  he won it he won you won that show how many years ago now it's like three damn but it's it's on the  wikipedia page yeah yeah it's all on wiki oh you don't know oh so many great people jimmy fallon  what's the prize money for that don't you get prize for jimmy fallon  for last comic you win a quarter of a million dollars and your your choice of baseline model hondas  base model yeah uh do you ride do i ride my car is it a car car i thought it was a honda motorcycle 
[02:45:00]  yeah i got i love motorcycles oh you do me and alonzo broden um no i it was i got a honda they gave  me like an suv and i was like that's impractical so i got a honda civic i love it because it's green  yeah um where do you live i live in la oh okay so car is pretty pretty important yeah i don't know  out there that's a good price yeah i don't know anyone that takes if you take the metro or public  transit la it means you're poor you're an asshole not thrifty yeah or a hipster new york is uh you 
[02:45:30]  know you you don't really need a car no it's kind of impractical to have one if you live in new  york so i got one me too yeah but rich people the one percent is allowed you are the one percent oops  how's it feel that's nice it's pretty good that's a great percentage to be that one percent shit is  fantastic now the one percentage you have like meetings and stuff you get together we laugh at the 99  percent we're supposed to feel guilty at this point you want the one percent i guess we make  we make uh we make dart boards out of this guy's face i'm actually marketing on my website i'm selling 
[02:46:00]  dart boards of this protester's blood can you make a t-shirt out of that that's great i can't believe  anyone's shocked that it turned to that like from the beginning i hated this movement i'm sorry and  for the fact that it turned bloody and and violent like obviously hippies can't stay calm for a long  time this is not the 60s no and and one thing they did last night on the news they're showing  this guy all bloody and stuff and it's one bloody guy and uh then they switched to the greece uh the 
[02:46:30]  the uh riots in greece and they are just throwing fucking knives and wrenches they know how to protest  and the cops are shooting tear gas it's like now that's a fucking protest it's kind of like when  the lakers win yeah yeah exactly cars are being turned over it's the same thing cars are being rolled  over and set on fire do they have the bread hats what's a bread hat what the bread hats do they  have any of the bread that brought the egyptian protester who strapped bread to his head to  protect them oh the helmets that was hilarious impenetrable the makeshift helmets were awesome  when they were getting made of bread yeah they were getting hit with like a tear gas canister 
[02:47:00]  what if they get hit with water yeah exactly yeah i would hit him with eggs and cinnamon and uh just  smell the deliciousness and a flamethrower thank you i need to thank you you helped me  so how is it to be a very attractive girl comic because there are no i've never been an ugly there  aren't too many of them well you've seen like you've seen some gruesome uh female comics margaret 
[02:47:30]  margaret choe oh i didn't say that i did i did do margaret choe even knows she's not attractive  she's not she's nicer breasts than you expect her to i don't know margaret i've met her than you and  i was like take it easy jimmy she's nice breasts you seen the breasts oh yeah all right i don't  think about it that often and i'll be honest and this is just being 100 honest i really missed that  part of my career because i won last comic where you're on the road with a headliner that's trying  to hit on you and you're like i did send it for three years prior so i really missed that middle 
[02:48:00]  part where you're always trying to prove yourself to to the other guy comments because i did because  i had such a weird stunted career so it at times people don't trust you you walk on stage and if  they don't know who you are they didn't come to see you they look at you for a second they're like  what's she gonna say but after a minute it's done like why is the cocktail waitress on stage pretty  much yeah i actually had a couple people when i first started uh give me their orders  who did you beat last comic um of like the final yeah yeah uh you know lewis ramey oh yeah 
[02:48:30]  really nice guy so he was him uh and then some comics i don't even know yeah of course i don't  even know who cares lewis ramey has been around when i first started he's a he's a black comic he's  really clean very polished you know lewis right um he's been around for a while yeah it's like  look what are my first comedy shows i'm just trying to hawk my wares here leave me alone i don't know 
[02:49:00]  this guy what am i trying to hop my ass to vagina  i took it to a new level you really did do one first sorry but lewis ramey you know i really put  brian on the spot there with fucking you really know lewis and he just he just sat there he wanted  to go no i've never heard of him but he's too nice right yeah the show runs the gamut from  comics you've never heard of and will never hear of again to comics that have been around for a  while and just wanted a little career well you're you're no dat fan lady let me tell you thank you 
[02:49:30]  he fucking ruined that show oh he really did it threw any credibility that show could have out  the fucking window when he won it did but it didn't i'll tell you why what because that was meant  that show was meant for for newer younger comedians like eliza wasn't doing it  the comedian part in though but i'm saying you aren't doing it for a whole lot of years to me  you're you're what belongs on that show because you're not like some veteran was doing it 15 20  years it was for newer comics to give you because we don't have like american idol i guess comics so  it's meant to give you for people that are struggling to give you a platform it's not so 
[02:50:00]  many people it's the most hurtful thing they'll be like i'll see him at a club they'll be like so  what have you been doing since that's comic i'll be like i've been working like a comic this isn't last  oscar winner standing right right i've had a fucking career asshole and that's what it's that's what it's meant to do  but it's not it's not fair i was a fan of the show they just picked the wrong guy with that fan  that's what right yeah i was entertained by a lot of the the guys that were on the show over the years  it's one of those things where if you're you be careful what you wish for because you get the show  and they're like by the way now you're a headliner so you better have the material uh whether he did 
[02:50:30]  or didn't i don't know but the people i'll say he did john heffron john reeb me like they told me  now you got to go headline i was like well i will spend all night writing and make sure and i did  the day i had a headlining gig it was done so it really it's kill or be killed heffron's funny  john blue is funny alonzo is funny i mean all those guys are i was just shocked when they went  with that i think they learned from dad fan because like she said you have to have a certain amount of  time yeah so i think and they put them up against regular comics like ralphie and and boss and then 
[02:51:00]  oh wait is that the same year or no i think so yeah i think rich was in on that one right rich was in  i never watched the show yeah it's like he absolutely was no voss was season no voss came  back i'm sorry yeah one and three for voss thank you eric all i know is i was on the season no one  saw no one who hosted your season was it jay or bill bellamy everyone's like i missed that season  so i'm like the loss there's one after mine that absolutely no one watched too well did they bring in  a british girl too to try to like you know she hosted with bill bellamy uh english it up nice girl but 
[02:51:30]  it's like this isn't the x factor this isn't yeah but she was cool but it was almost like it's such a  so light on copy why do you have two hosts messing up my life right enough with fucking the people  thinking british people have a take on comedy that's so great they don't they think farts and  tits are terrific too speaking of when i was in the hallway this is not funny now that i'm saying it but  i was just talking and there's a guy with headphones on at the computer yeah i don't know if you know  who he was and i was just talking to someone all of a sudden we just hear and we just looked over and  it was obviously him it was a great way to start the morning wait is it was it the fucking was it the the 
[02:52:00]  the vamp the vampire at the fucking computer right now or no kenny please tell me kenny farted  it was him oh get kenny in here for a second just because it wasn't me and it wasn't the person i was  talking to yeah and it wasn't well maybe it was great that's our guy oh unless it was rolando and  he didn't tell us can you get kenny in here no no don't no trust me you want to meet ken kenny  you sure want to meet no don't do this oh you get embarrassed i don't want to be like dude so 
[02:52:30]  he's not going to own up to it he might probably no this is my first time meeting this person don't  worry about it you know what we're doing hey that's brian we know what we're doing all  right listening we're good at ruining careers hi this is uh hi it's kenny kenny did you fart in  front of this fine young lady we need honesty here today sir i have been known to fart yeah  that you farted while you were there on headphones just kind of sitting there and that you kind of 
[02:53:00]  just kind of fought very inappropriate yeah what happened farting is a normal body function i mean  i don't know a lot of guys holding a beautiful lady around yeah it's the first time for each other  what do you not think i'm attractive oh yeah what's going on i'm not looking to hook up  that's a shame he's happily making one of your tumblers he's making sure not to hook up  i'm making a point on this yeah you're aggressively avoiding it yeah don't even think of me 
[02:53:30]  i can see maybe not being interested but to go that to that degree so you don't care who's around  you'll fart because we'll we'll hold it if there's an attractive woman around no i didn't i didn't  consciously know like anything happened yeah the headphones on so you probably didn't hear it  you probably thought it was a silent one wasn't you're as unfazed then as you are now well that's  why we wanted you to meet him yeah this is the face of kenny right there he's just like uh  nothing phases him at all yeah i love the dramatic pause between the question and the answer on that 
[02:54:00]  yeah did you fart well you know like he's testifying are you farting right now  it's okay it's all right kenny it's all good life happens it happens all right i'll take his  shit on the side of the road if i have to okay well i don't want that anymore you don't have you  you've seen him do that no but when he was with dicey did yeah okay i think you were in the car one  time no i wasn't one time we were we were going to uh jfk airport happy face's girlfriend was driving 
[02:54:30]  weren't you in the car with us we were all going to the airport maybe they just picked me up and me  and happy face were going to jfk and we were on the uh staten island expressway and i had to go  you know and and the first morning constitutional comes with urgency  jesus oh no didn't you know you had a big flight coming up i mean yeah you had time at home to  yeah really you plan on shitting on the plane not the fucking west shore expressway 
[02:55:00]  there are other places where these things can take place i got a  hospital yeah i squatted behind a bush i'm glad i came to them yeah today's a good day  thanks you're responsible for this conversation you're welcome exactly  people are google imaging you right now and losing their minds by the way they're freaking  out over your uh pictures online yeah you got a boyfriend i don't know  we don't talk about things like that i don't know 
[02:55:30]  i don't like any of the pictures online do you it's really weird for for a female comic the one  different i don't see there's no real difference it's just after shows um it's got to be two is it  harder for you because uh are guys weird about dating the comic that they've just seen or do they  hit on you or they're intimidated by it it's intimate there's it's a run the game from  intimidation to admiration it's usually you know you go into a city people make effort come to see  you and they're so cool and if they try to hit it it's like an awkward line and often i'm sure you  get if someone references a line in your act and you don't remember saying it they're like right with 
[02:56:00]  pizza and you're like what it looks like you don't know your own jokes like i have no clue he's like  you said it the last time you were on no i didn't no i don't know you what i do get not jealous of but  i wish i were a guy in this case after shows i've seen and i've heard stories like my male comic  friends or even features or i hear my friends do this they're like yeah i banged three waitresses  went out we just got shit face and as a girl not not only do we not keep well but that's just not a good 
[02:56:30]  idea if you don't want to get raped so i don't do that my friends are like we did all this and i'm  like i went back to the hotel i took a bath i watch hbo because it's not it's just not the same kind  of rules like you guys could go out and enjoy the city alone i could but you don't want to end up on  the news it would be a little yeah a little awful so i kind of just i spent a lot of time in hotels  having me time oh it's okay it's fucking boring on the road it really is you sleep all day do you get  up early i sleep late i can't fucking sleep until three in the afternoon as late as i can  yeah and then sleep is king and if you have press that ruins it because you have to get up 
[02:57:00]  i won't do morning and afternoon in the same uh morning i can handle but fucking morning and then  you go get to sleep and then they got to get up and do some shitty afternoon shows we can get you at  one i'm like yeah right in the middle of the rem cycle that'd be great yeah how many tickets  is sold well you got 72 for the early all right come get me at one it can be lonely but and also it  sucks too if because i never rent cars because i did once and i got a ticket so i won't do it again  uh shocker uh if you don't have a car and you're in a city where you know there's stuff to go see 
[02:57:30]  and you're just sitting at the howard johnson inn or wherever they put you just knowing that there's  like a world of stuff out there stuff out there i just can't get to it i can't get to it yeah  i always feel that way flying in you know when you're flying in you look down at the city and you  think uh man i'm gonna be hitting the museums i'm gonna take advantage of this town and then you  get there and you just sleep till showtime pretty much and then they say have you been to st louis  and you're yeah technically yes but i don't they told me i was in st louis i don't know where the 
[02:58:00]  arches jim brewer goes everywhere though brewer's one of those guys who checks it out bill burr checks  it out burr goes to the the events burr goes to a lot of athletic events does he drive does he rent a  car i don't know he probably does know him right yeah yeah yeah he takes it all in i remember we did that  gig in detroit we never saw detroit but technically we were there now remember thank god yeah well  there's sections i'm not allowed i'm not allowed to carry in detroit i don't like that hotel was in

[02:59:30]  we're here it's a little pepperoni you want a free slice that was you brian wasn't it i just assume  no one knows who i am ever like even at the club i'll walk up and be like my name is eliza schlesinger  i'm the headliner tonight i was wondering if i could get just a soda  i know the one day i assume i'm like you know who i am my picture's up there they're gonna be  like i don't or i'm not i just so you don't i don't yeah i'm not in charge of that thing that  thing getting you stuff is it schlesinger or schlesinger schlesinger okay i've actually 
[03:00:00]  missed general oh everyone has ever i think we all did so i don't even that's okay eliza schlesinger is  that german schlesinger yeah maybe maybe i asked my parents i was like do we have any and they're  like no it's just polish as far back as the eye can see that's good i like that eastern european  thing yeah we've got meaty thighs that's good that's good blonde hair meaty thighs that's what  we do meaty thighs you could run your hand up to the vagina or ass that's right yeah it's in the  same place wherever people oh jesus yeah polish women are very sexy where'd you grow up dallas okay 
[03:00:30]  texas dallas that's near warsaw i think right yes it's very close it's a direct flight yeah  kelly got shot there yes we know thank you today was the day we had shaken the entire  remember we went to bring it back we went to the whole museum we went to dealie plaza and  and jimmy turned it into a joke in his act where you see everyone go in the middle of the road to  get the picture on the x on the x yeah and we were secretly hoping someone would get the 
[03:01:00]  fucking hit or shot we saw one that was shot we saw one that was close because it's sort of  downhill at that point and when that light turns green those cars take off and these dummies are  in the road trying to get their picture taken it is amazing how there's robert rodent and all these  people out there in these different stations of the assess of the knoll and just they've been there  every day since the assassination and the more i love little card tables with their dumb books and  literature and pamphlets brian pamphlets pamphlets i tell you what dealie plaza is the only place 
[03:01:30]  that i've been you know every other place you've seen pictures of you know uh like the alamo and stuff  like that but dealie plaza is the only place when i drove through there um without knowing that that  we were driving through there i instantly knew where i was because that place you've seen from  every angle yeah most other things you only see from one angle that place you've seen photos from  every angle it looks like a movie set yeah it's very bizarre well isn't there a carbon copy on both  sides it's almost like two of the of the knoll and the fence on the other side like a mirror image on the 
[03:02:00]  side i don't know i know that the sixth floor museum has a section dedicated to each conspiracy  theory really which is kind of cool yeah i finally saw it once when i was in college because growing  up you're like it's right there yeah i'm not gonna bother yeah that would be great if you ever wanted  to go to prison to just wait until someone stands on that fucking x and blow their head off just go yeah  you really got the experience that time didn't you i think someone did that they killed themselves on the  x killing yourself is different yeah that's different a couple years ago picture taken  and it's like all right i'm here take a picture bam the head just comes apart and you're like holy 
[03:02:30]  if i'm not mistaken someone uh committed suicide on the x that's probably true i think i do remember  yeah i think we talked about it on the air and i went to the museum but you're not allowed next to  the window anymore the sniper blast off yeah i feel like i remember that why's that so you have to see  it from sort of a distance like i don't know you're about six seven feet away like kennedy did i don't know  yeah yeah you have to look back over your shoulder at it did you like it i feel like  most things when you go see them they're underwhelming like the alamo is two feet long yes it's very  weird there's only a few tourist attractions i've i dug one of them was dealy plaza and the whole thing 
[03:03:00]  and also uh alcatraz oh that was great too man amazing everyone likes that one yeah but i went to the  brady bunch house and the uh the back to the future house is the brady bunch i know you're kidding  but is it on a lot or is it a real house no it's a real house but it's uh pico  uh oh i think it is right i'm not sure wait a minute it it didn't look like the house because  like you know it's the whole front yard is different they put a fence around it and  no look if you're gonna buy the brady bunch house you got to deal with the 
[03:03:30]  shit i know it comes with it you can't change the house and the window  but the future house looks exactly the same as it did in back to the future  but they they someone bought the omniville horror house and changed the whole look of it  so you can't do that yeah we want to drive by it and check it out  sometimes there's things like historical like plaques that they put and you can't  change anything if you agree to live in certain things i should do that one movie  housing it was cool the exorcist steps i allow it was cool georgetown you realize the house is  farther yeah where uh caris fell down at the end but you realize the house is a little farther from 
[03:04:00]  there than the movie portrayed it but to sit on those steps it really is a chilling  fright if you went at night it's a very very frightening it leads into a gas station parking lot  yeah i didn't even realize it was a true movie yeah i know it's just fiction so scary wait a  minute it's just a stairway i thought you're saying it's just the set that's chilling it's  a true no the steps the steps of the of like at the end of the movie oh those are it's a real  house and real stairs it's not a thing it's a true story oh oh i thought you were saying it was an 
[03:04:30]  actual true thing that they made a movie out of oh yeah the actual the actual steps that they filmed  in the movie it's just a movie yeah it shouldn't have been that scary to me quite frankly but it  was it's why it's just a movie it's creepy there was somebody going all right quiet action yeah i  know it wasn't like it wasn't really scary things that was that's the beauty of it that's how well  done it was i'm sorry very frightening you do alcatraz i haven't seen it i haven't been it's worth it 
[03:05:00]  that one is cool you know what's weird at alcatraz they give you like headsets where you can listen  to the headset tour but nobody starts them at exactly the same time so you're walking around  with other people and they're listening and they're about 30 seconds off and they're going oh did you  hear that i mean not yet i thought but i've seen this scene and so i married an axe murderer oh yeah  that's all i know about alcohol i mean we're in la uh you live in hollywood right in the filthy  heart of it man you're in the shit huh i call the cops bi-weekly because of low rider 
[03:05:30]  uh base outside my world like where like down near the uh like by the arc light i don't know  where that is it's uh like sunset and vine no that's not right well ish it's like in that area  but you're there you're right in the middle of if in case i want to go to a club i love nightclubs  that's me yeah yes or some sort of indie rock band man would you consider yourself part hipster  or no i do wear very tight pants yeah skinny that's good yeah but aside from that no no no 
[03:06:00]  i'm not cool enough oh it's okay i bet you i think i like sports too much to really well let me  rephrase that i think i played sports too much to be oh oh a lesbian that's right i played softball  and lacrosse no field hockey field hockey no field hockey was the giveaway for at my school it was the  bitchy girls that played not the lesbians it was i just i saw too many things i like lacrosse because 
[03:06:30]  it's more aggressive yeah is that what you played that's pretty badass cool it was fun it was the  first year our school had done it so no one like really knew how to play so oh so you could become  a star like instantly hey look she was able to catch it in that basket thing she's the star big claim  to fame final game my senior year you know you can get yellow cards and red cards i would hit  people and you're not allowed to do that i got a red card so bad they made not only ejected me from  the game they made me sit in the stands with my parents you couldn't even sit with my team with 
[03:07:00]  your team was crying i was so upset damn how old were you i was like 17. wow as an almost an adult  i was crying crying i was so because it's so embarrassing like i didn't mean to knock  right in the throat did you really right in the fucking throat man get it off me you shouldn't  have been crying you should have been high-fiving your parents yeah yeah it was sad why do you have  the one nail different does it mean anything or no that's like the thing to do oh that looks cool 
[03:07:30]  i just didn't know that's it no thank you anytime i do anything on tv i always try to paint like a bright  color because that's what it's about your nails i haven't rehearsed this at once no i bother just  just just look good people tuning in jimmy fallon tonight yeah make sure you check out jimmy fallon  when he rescheduled on letterman do you know yeah that's brian uh next wednesday oh yeah you  can just you got there and then they were like sorry herman cain's here yeah backstage dressed the  whole thing you know makeup on of course it's the comic that they keep on the dirt bag right there 
[03:08:00]  there was a band on the show too group love which is a great band they did their set but is it  there's too much logistics to get them rebooked so yeah yeah yeah not that i haven't had an issue  with it i group love was great they did a great job and uh go check them out good go check them out  and vote for herman cain and watch eliza tonight you vote for herman cain yeah brian's close to letting  it all out you can see we've all these years for way too many years with my parents in the stands  now where's dealie plaza does it take luck fucking rope and stool 
[03:08:30]  it's always the comic that gets yeah it's always we don't have time for you or i'm sure at the  beginning of your career which mine was is a lot closer to recent times uh you know you go to like  do a gig they're like we're just gonna leave the tv on while you do your standout or we're gonna like  it's always awful i'm sure i had that in uh the first time ever played in canada the first time ever  performed in winnipeg and the winnipeg jets were in the playoffs oh and they had these big screens 
[03:09:00]  man all over this club that i was playing at and uh what little i know about canada they like hockey  yeah apparently they really do like their hockey and they said well we're gonna start the show and  i'm like while the hockey game is on and they're like yeah eight o'clock show and i'm like oh man this  is get me out of this country yeah they keep the tvs on yeah so they're cheering when they're  scoring goals and stuff a lot of night shitheads that sucks go home if you want to watch the 
[03:09:30]  game leave all right wow you try saying that and they don't uh respond they won't they won't  they won't care they don't get they want the drink money and the you know yeah i have people i've had  events i recently where they're like why don't you we're going to show some clips of something else that  they were promoting and then we'll have you come up to five minutes i'm like this isn't street  magic that's not how it works you have to like fight to get your proper time it's great do you  do you toil over what uh you're wearing on uh fallon and stuff like that yeah i was actually out last 
[03:10:00]  night i still don't have a top i don't think anybody here cares but it's tough because you don't  want to dress up like i don't dress up in general and if you wear something too revealing no one's  going to listen to you right so you really have to walk a fine pot yeah it's really weird for women  you don't want to show you want to look good but you don't want to like really use complete  sexuality like i knew a comedian that would do that she's dead now so i won't say her name but  all i would do is try to look up her skirt while she was on stage at the boston comedy club oh  she would literally wear a skirt right a quarter inch below her pussy and it was like how do you not  look but then i didn't remember i didn't remember anything she said she probably wasn't was she funny 
[03:10:30]  i don't remember i don't know i don't know i don't know i have no idea but like sarah silverman's a good  example she's you know very beautiful but she doesn't she dresses like she looks very  presentable yeah but she doesn't go with sexuality so you listen to her you just dress  how you are if you on stage dress i'll dress up that's how you should be off stage so i dress like  a homeless person both so you'll just be like this pretty much for tv i think you get a little  bit more leeway because you already have the audience you're not going to bomb right they're 
[03:11:00]  not going to allow that to happen you already know the jokes kill because you've been doing them  forever so you can afford to spruce it up a bit and come out of your comfort zone because it's almost  a guaranteed laugh i'm going to watch to see how you gussy yourself up yeah do you gussy yourself  brush these teeth  more deodorant i might wear my hair up we don't know yet it is different on tv though you can look  good on tv like amy schumer did her comedy touch special she looked great yeah i've worked with amy  a hundred times i never saw her look that way but on tv is a different vibe her thing is the cute 
[03:11:30]  like she wears like cute dresses and stuff that's yeah i wore a dress once and uh that'll be that  how'd that work out for you it was great i did a fall i fell on purpose and no one saw my underwear  which was the whole beauty of the whole thing that's why i did it uh but in general i think  pants are better yeah i think you have more we're watching jimmy feld tonight huh yeah yeah i think we  are i think we're all watching jimmy feld i want to see what i want to watch she's a liar well next  wednesday oh we'll watch let him next wednesday sir i'm gonna have a uh gripe with him i've got a  pretty cool uh top that i'm going to wear was herman cain wearing his double-breasted 
[03:12:00]  suit when he bumped you uh he was looking pretty good i got to meet him in the hallway  tell him he's not going to a wedding and tell him he's not going to be president that way he must  know was he charismatic though very they always are very very sociopaths are i tell you what man he  like uh it was just a little moment but he looked me in the eye and we had a 30 second conversation and  it seemed very real and genuine yeah that's when he was telling you he was going to bump you you're 
[03:12:30]  like this is real yeah yeah i'm genuinely being bumped yes really yeah it was a really weird moment  he put his fingers under your nose  brian so you're flying back to vegas and then coming back next week yeah so come back and see us  can you work that into your little schedule i will try to do that we'd love to see it's been way too long  thank you way too long so i guess we should get the plugs out because we're ending yeah yes we are  so brian will be uh let me give brian's plugs state theater in new brunswick december 10th and uh
