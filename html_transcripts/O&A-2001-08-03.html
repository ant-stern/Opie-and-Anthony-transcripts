<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast centered on "Sex for Sam 2," a contest where couples competed for a trip to Boston to see the Foo Fighters and tour the Sam Adams brewery by having sex in various public locations throughout Manhattan.  The competition was sponsored by Sam Adams, GoldenPalace.com, Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed, and Stacker 2, with advertisements for these products peppering the broadcast.  The show featured in-studio guests including comedian Stephen Lynch, Rich Voss, Jim Cook (the Sam Adams representative and master of ceremonies, who arrived late), and Old Dirty Bastard.  Several show regulars acted as spotters, including Rick, Stinky, and Ben, following different couples and providing live, explicit commentary on their progress.

Numerous teams participated, each with memorable nicknames: "Pebbles and Bam Bam" (Stinky's team), "The Hungarian Humpers" (Stephen Lynch's team, comprising Mickey and Timmy), "The C-Blockers" (Rick's team, Rob and Jamie), and "The AK-47s" (Voss's team).  Teams earned points based on location difficulty—with locations ranging from Times Square (near a homeless person and a billboard), Yankee Stadium, specific hotels, theme restaurants, a movie theater, Central Park, Radio City Music Hall, F.A.O. Schwarz, a Nike store, a bus with a "WOW" sign, the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum, Penn Station (in a PLJ van), NBC Studios at Rockefeller Center, Trump Tower, TGI Fridays, museums, libraries, and even an attempted location at Tiffany & Co.—and additional "two-point conversions" were awarded for specific sexual acts.  One team even attempted a rendezvous in front of a celebrity and on a roof.  A couple intended to participate but were unable to due to childcare issues.

The broadcast consisted primarily of the hosts' running commentary interspersed with graphic descriptions of the couples' activities relayed by the spotters.  Jim Cook's reactions to the on-air accounts were also a prominent feature.  Teams faced various challenges, including security interference, exhaustion (one team member even experienced sore feet), and logistical hurdles in navigating NYC while engaging in the competition.  Michael Winslow, the sound effects comedian from *Police Academy*, famously fled the studio in horror after witnessing a couple's actions.  Pebbles and Bam Bam consistently utilized the "two-point conversion," significantly contributing to their victory.  The broadcast also involved numerous phone check-ins with the teams, discussions of their strategies, and debates over scoring discrepancies.  Ultimately, Pebbles and Bam Bam won with 252 points, followed by The AK-47s and The C-Blockers in second and third place respectively, while the Hungarian Humpers and Ben and CAC's team finished fourth and last, respectively, due to scoring disputes and Ben's lack of participation.  The show concluded with listener calls, further explicit descriptions, and a preview of upcoming show changes, all while promoting Sam Adams beer.

For everyone else all over the country, 866-277-4WOW. Your Jess is important, so please give us a call, okay? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah. Yeah. It's Sex for Sam 2 day, Anthony. Sex for Sam 2. What a day. Couples out in the city having intercourse. Isn't that great? That's pretty much it. That in a nutshell.  Doggy? Doggy?  Yes. Doggy if you want.  Hot Carl? 
[00:02:00]  No Hot Carls, I don't think.  Piledriver?  Yeah, you can do the Piledriver.  The Filthy Sanchez?  Well, yeah, maybe with a reach around.  It's coming right for us!  All right.  And the master of ceremonies for today's competition, Jim Cook.  I don't know when he's arriving from Sam Adams, but he'll be here soon.  I just saw hand truck after hand truck of cases of Sam Adams being brought in to the studio, to our office.  More beer. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, you got to see how many cases of beer we have in our office.  And we go through a lot every day.  Oh, yeah.  It's gotten to the point where Anthony sits, he can no longer see Rick because there are cases of beer.  There are just cases stacked up.  It's a big wall-o'-beer.  We've thrown some over to Ron and Fez for their office, and just to clear out some room before today.  And then today, there's more beer than we ever had in there.  Right.  Because we just got a new shipment, care of Sam Adams.  All right, we should explain Sex for Sam 2, Anthony. 
[00:03:00]  It's a fine little competition we came up with last year.  We have a trip to Boston to hang out at the St. Adams Brewery and see the Foo Fighters.  It's just one big-ass party, like a two- or three-day party.  Plenty of beer flowing.  Beer.  And today, we have a little competition to determine who's going to be flying to Boston to the brewery.  It's Sex for Sam.  Sex for Sam 2.  We have, what, five or six couples?  How many couples we got, Rick?  At last count, it's five.  But I got a call from a guy who says his bus was running a little late, but he's on the way, so we could have as many as six or seven. 
[00:03:30]  Nice.  Do we have enough spotters for all these couples?  Yeah, we've got enough.  Okay, so we've got five or six, maybe seven couples, Anthony.  Is Earl going to be a spotter?  Thank God, no.  No, Earl's going to be helping out us today.  I don't know what sex is.  How do I confirm it?  Oh, look at Earl giving you the finger.  Flipping me the big gay finger.  Wow, that's scary.  Ooh.  Ouch.  Ooh, Earl.  Anyway.  Go off yourself.  So we have, it's got to be 30 locations on our Sex for Sam list here. 
[00:04:00]  Should we really give these out?  No, no, no, no.  That's what I'm thinking, too.  No, I mean, when the folks are playing at home, they'll understand where these people are having sex and how many points they're getting for each location, okay?  After they're done, then we can announce where it just was.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There are some very popular locations.  I think we could name a few, though, Anthony.  You think?  For example, in front of a celebrity.  Oh, yeah, some of those that can just happen anywhere.  That'll earn a couple 30 points if they could pull that one off today. 
[00:04:30]  In front of a celebrity.  In front of a celebrity.  All right.  Roof of a building.  A cab.  A cab.  In front of a hot dog vendor.  These are some of the easy ones that they should, you know, get out of the way right away.  Central Park.  Central Park's so big.  They'll get away with that one.  Did we put in front of a homeless person?  Yeah, a homeless person is on the list.  Nice.  Down under ATM.  You know, a city boss. 
[00:05:00]  And I think that's about all we can mention.  No, the big money one.  Which one is the big money one?  Any live shot.  Oh, yeah.  Any live shot.  Sex on live TV will get the couples 50 points.  50 points.  50 points.  Which, look, if I tune into a TV show and someone's doing a live shot and I see a couple  come edging their way into the frame and the guy's just slamming his chick, I will die laughing. 
[00:05:30]  If that happens, we will just have to end the radio show.  Oh, my God.  We're just going home early.  50 points.  Because we're not going to beat that today.  No.  So, don't forget about the two-point.  Oh, yeah, the two-point conversion.  Two-point conversion.  We're continuing this from last year.  If the act is done in the backdoor action.  We call it the balloon knot.  The balloon knot.  If the guy scores in the balloon knot, you get the amount of points that are put aside  for that location plus two additional points. 
[00:06:00]  Correct.  This came in.  This was key last year, Opie.  Yeah.  That was the difference.  Yeah.  It turns out the winning team had less points if you just went by location.  But they racked up the two-point conversion.  Two-point conversion at every single location.  Every location.  His chick couldn't sit down on the plane flying to Boston, but they were going.  But they were going is right.  Now, we got our spotters in the studio. 
[00:06:30]  We're stinky.  We got Rick, who's going to follow one of the couples out.  He's already drinking the Sam Adams to get ready.  No cheating, Rick.  The guys have been boozing it up nicely to get ready for the competition.  Everyone's been making fun of Rick today.  I didn't even cheat last year.  Well, there's questions about that.  He came in second.  He cheated for second place.  Yeah, he cheated for second.  Well, he doesn't know how to cheat the right way.  Also in the studio is Stephen Lynch helping us out.  Stephen Lynch is going to be spotting. 
[00:07:00]  Very nice.  This is sick.  Are you into this or what?  I love it.  Okay.  I'm going to do all my reporting as one of those old-time movie reels.  Yeah.  The children are running out of F.A.L. Schwab's as he sticks his C in her C.  Whatever works for you, man.  That sounds good.  The birds are singing.  The sun is shining on the deck of the...  Back to you.  You've got to do it like that now.  Now everyone is expecting that.  Also, Rich Voss is going to help us today.  I'm looking forward to this. 
[00:07:30]  There you go.  You don't have a record or anything, do you?  No, no.  Okay.  What kind of record?  But I have a CD.  I have a CD.  Before we get started, I just want to say Norris will be at Rassels tonight, my good pal, Jeff Norris.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we're good friends now.  Did he punch you in the face?  No, I learned my lesson after he threw me off the chair here and I was thrown in the pool.  I, you know, there's a new light in my life.  All right.  Look at that.  And I'm trying to be a couple with Rachel, you know.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Good luck. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, Rachel.  Well, I don't want to get into it right now.  She's got some things going on.  And it's okay with us.  As long as she tells us about it, all right?  Right.  I'm entering in the singles category.  Are you?  Yeah.  There you go.  Now, Stinky will be a spotter today.  What's up?  Stinky, of course, going above and beyond the Call of Duty last year for Sex with Sam, the original one.  Now, this year, Sex with Sam 2, the heretic.  Stinky, we're looking forward to you doing just as good a job as you did last year. 
[00:08:30]  He really made his bones last year.  He was just another slob intern last year.  And he really came to the table.  And can I use any other cliches?  Come to the table.  He stepped out of the spaz shadow.  Yeah.  Yes, he did.  Yes, you did.  Right there.  And then you actually did something and it worked.  He's been mapping his course all day.  Yeah.  He's got one of those big maps with the push pins on it.  The roots are color-coded.  You're going to go here.  The guy's roots, what?  Do the couples get extra points if the spotter gets involved? 
[00:09:00]  We had this girl call.  She wanted to do a threesome the whole way.  Really?  Yeah, but they backed out, right?  Unfortunately.  Then there was another couple that was going to try to conceive during this contest.  What a great thing to tell your kids.  But listen to this.  Go ahead.  Tell everyone why they're not doing the competition.  I got them on the phone.  I pitched an idea that I thought would definitely get them in the studio.  But they refused to have one of our people babysit for their child.  They thought it was a little, I don't know. 
[00:09:30]  So, what's the word I'm looking for?  Not good for a child to be in a radio station.  Of course not.  But they were going to try to conceive another one on the streets of New York.  Right.  Got to love that.  But that's okay.  And the person that is most excited about today, I haven't seen excitement from this  man in months.  It's Ben.  Ben.  I have full confidence this year that I will have my couple of action.  I will kick all these guys' asses.  Yeah, very disappointing last year.  If you remember Sex for Sam last year, Ben's couple. 
[00:10:00]  Never got on the board.  Tried it once at an ATM.  The guy had a wet noodle.  He tried it once at the ATM.  Then they went to a theme restaurant.  Back of a cab first, Ed.  Back of the cab, right.  Didn't work there.  Then they went to a theme restaurant where, again, it did not work.  They decided to just stay in the theme restaurant and drink until they were snotted drunk.  They forfeited, gave up.  By that point, too, when they got to the theme restaurant, the other teams were already up  to like 30, 40 points.  Something ridiculous.  Yeah, so it just was over.  And Ben's checking in and there's just sad music in the background and they're ordering 
[00:10:30]  shots and rounds.  It was so funny last year.  And Ben was getting pissed because his team was just like, it ain't gonna happen.  There's nothing happening here.  Nothing.  There's nothing happening.  I think this guy might be gay.  You know what?  Not this year, man.  I got it all planned out.  I got my whole rod.  I'm ready to go.  Let's go.  Now, how are you guys going to pick your...  See, I have not had the advantage of seeing the list of places that Stinky has been good  enough to color coordinate.  Color-coded.  There you go.  Pass that over.  There you go.  Those are the list of locations.  Boss and I are flying by the seat of our pants. 
[00:11:00]  I know.  I have no clue.  There you go.  Can you get a copy?  All right.  There you go.  You guys all got cell phones and...  Hey, why is my apartment listed on here?  Don't mention them.  Don't say it.  Don't mention any of them.  No, because we almost got arrested last year.  Oh, really?  Okay.  We don't want the people to know where we're going this year.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  Keep it on the Q-take.  It was a little scary last year.  There were cops chasing couples last year.  No, really?  Oh, yeah.  That's why I asked you if you had a record.  No, I don't have a record.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Is that what you're talking about?  Yes.  Is there a chance for a rest here?  No, not from you. 
[00:11:30]  You just run away.  We have to keep a healthy distance, right?  We just have to be close enough to see what's going on.  You just see what's going on.  You cannot get arrested unless you play some of your songs.  There's never a chance of being arrested.  Oh, no.  Was that even a slam?  I don't get it.  What is that?  Wait a minute.  No, you can't get arrested if you...  Boss, you screwed that up totally.  I thought it was some sort of busking reference and apparently not.  Tony. 
[00:12:00]  What's up, guys?  Hey, boy.  You left out one thing.  The only bone that got lit up with Ben's team was that dupe they were smoking.  Oh, I forgot about the dupe.  Yeah.  In the middle of the theme restaurant.  That's right.  You guys were trying everything to get this guy going.  He was smoking weed.  He was doing shots.  He tried everything.  And he was, like, smashing his head against the wall.  It was very frustrating.  Right.  Will not happen this year.  That'll help.  Dude, quick point.  New markets, buckle down, baby.  You're in for a hell of a ride today, man.  Check the same rules.  It really does.  Thank you, Tony.  It's going to be sickness, man. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  What about performance-enhancing drugs?  Are they allowed?  I think one of the couples were using the Viagra.  Absolutely.  And encouraged, probably.  Yes, it's encouraged.  We don't care about any drugs you want to use.  You guys want to pass out the pinnacle horn and go we?  Any devices?  Might as well.  You want to use a C-ring to keep it going?  We don't care.  What has to be slot A into tab B or tab B into slot A?  All right.  However that works.  Just a mouth.  As I was just saying that, like Voss.  Does a mouth have anything to do with this? 
[00:13:00]  Can they get points from the mouth?  No.  No.  It's too easy.  Yeah, it's too easy.  You just need to be as a spotter.  You look.  You see that it happened.  You confirm it.  They get the points.  Joe, you're next.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just want to say we're firmly rooting for Stinky's team.  I have confidence that he will pull through for us.  Wow.  Thank you, Joe.  Stinky rules.  Stinky rules.  Ding-yang party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Should we meet the lovely couples or what? 
[00:13:30]  It's amazing what vodka and Red Bull do to you.  Woo.  That's what's going to make this great, too, because they're all snoted.  Yeah.  The only ones not snoted are Voss and Lynchy.  On live TV.  I know.  Yeah, that's the best thing.  Where the hell are you going to get that to happen?  TRL's happening in a little while.  You never know.  All the news stations do up their live shots.  It's a possibility, man.  There's a story going on.  Matter of fact, last year, the couple was in the middle of the TRL crowd, but we couldn't  confirm they were having sex because it was just a mob of people and whatever, but it 
[00:14:00]  almost happened.  Almost.  Oh, my.  Ah, look at our athletes now entering the studio.  Oh, man.  Here we go.  Representing, bro.  Right on.  Nice.  Yeah, cute.  Here they are.  Recognized.  Our participants now all in the studio.  Do we have enough spotters?  It looks like we have too many.  Yeah, we got five couples.  We have five spotters.  All right. 
[00:14:30]  Perfect.  Do we pick our own couple?  No, you don't.  We've got all the couples.  They're going to go into Stinky's Hat, and then everybody picks a couple.  All right.  Let's talk with some of them first.  What we'll do is get a little up close and personal.  Wait.  How about we do this?  The spotters will pick a couple, and then we'll bring the couple forward.  Ah, whoa.  Oh, look at that excitement.  Yeah, why not?  Yes.  Who gets to pick first?  Rick.  They need a name change here.  Name change.  Yeah.  You guys could use fake names, you know.  Yeah, it doesn't matter. 
[00:15:00]  Some people get, you know, all paranoid after they leave our show.  Why not?  All right.  All right.  What do you need?  All right.  Who gets to pick first?  Where's Stinky's Hat?  Stinky's got the hat.  All right.  Lynch.  Lynch.  Yeah, go start with Lynchie.  Lynch pick first.  All right.  Lynch is picking a couple.  It's going to say just a couple and a number, and then whoever signed in on that number  is your couple.  Couple number two.  Couple number two.  Mickey and Timmy.  Mickey and Timmy.  Yeah.  This is the gay couple.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  This is the what now? 
[00:15:30]  Well, just the names.  Mickey and Timmy.  Mickey and Timmy.  Oh.  Mickey's the girl.  Okay.  No, Mickey's the guy, actually.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  Where are you guys from?  Thank you.  Oh, we saw you in the elevator, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you lit or not?  Because we asked you if you were drinking.  Are you lit?  Wait, you're...  Mickey, yeah.  No, I mean...  We're working on it.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at him, man.  I got a bar juice in my bag here.  That's good.  You got to, you know...  You sure you didn't drink enough where you're going to have the whiskey, you know, the whiskey  did?  No problems with that, I think.  All right, good.  No problem with that.  No one of the whiskey did.  They look like a very virile couple. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  I'm pleased with my selection.  Very good, Lynch.  Hey, do you...  Yeah, how often would you say you don't have sex?  A week.  A lot, actually.  She came over from Europe because we met in December and...  Oh, she's European?  Oh, it's all over.  And, dude...  Close the books.  A relatively new relationship, too, right?  A couple of months, yeah.  A couple of months.  That's good.  Oh, wow.  That's good.  So, what?  Every night?  At least.  Every night at least?  That's good.  And you don't have any problem with a dysfunction of any sort?  I hope not.  Have you ever done this in public? 
[00:16:30]  Yes.  You have?  Yeah.  Oh, Lynch.  Wait, this is very important.  Let me ask...  Can I ask you a kind of...  Well, like, these all aren't personal questions, but...  Yeah.  Is there going to be protection used, or can we just go right to it?  We're using, like, one of those creams that are protective.  Oh, okay, okay.  I just don't want to deal with, you know...  That's good.  Now, as far as clothing goes, are you wearing something that you feel is easy access?  I'm wearing nice, loose jeans.  You're wearing loose jeans?  All right.  Now, are you wearing underwear? 
[00:17:00]  No.  Oh, very good.  And what is the young lady wearing?  Timmy.  Timmy.  Does she speak English?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  A little.  Where are you from?  From Hungary.  Oh, yes.  Hungary.  And she is hungry.  You know what they say about Hungary.  All right.  Hungry.  Hungry.  Hungry for some snacks.  Hungry for Mickey.  I know.  Nice.  Do you guys have any strategy for today?  Have you discussed it?  Well, we discussed it that we're going to sit there, look at the plan, and then very quickly  in Hungary and put our plan together so no one knows what it is, and then head off and... 
[00:17:30]  Right on.  I'm not going to know what the hell they're talking about.  Yeah, really.  You guys move over to the side.  It's Mickey and Timmy.  Is she wearing...  Are you wearing underwear, Timmy?  No.  She isn't wearing...  Very good.  She is set up...  Timmy's the girl?  Timmy's the girl.  No doubt.  All right.  All right.  Who picks next?  Rich Voss.  Timmy?  Timmy.  Timmy!  Voss now picking.  Couple number three.  Ah, he gets Jonathan and Mary.  Jonathan and Mary step right up to the microphone.  Look at that. 
[00:18:00]  Mary's no stranger to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh.  No stranger to the O.N.A. show.  A friend of a second mark, perhaps.  Now, Mary, isn't this the guy you broke up with live on our show?  Yeah, but she loves me, so, you know.  Would this guy get upset if you earn extra points doing extra things?  Voss, it's cool.  How many points extra for the spawner?  I don't know.  I think the spawner should get...  Oh, you don't get anything. 
[00:18:30]  Jeez, leave it to a Jew to try to eke out something for himself.  Oh, God.  God, Voss.  Mary, are you wearing panties?  Really?  She has no panties on.  No panties?  What are you wearing to make easy access?  I have boxers, but they'll be off for the competition.  Boxers, very good.  Now, how often are you making love these days?  Every day.  Every day.  See, that's good.  Very good.  I'm still...  I still got the Hungarian here, though.  You're still going with the Hungarian?  As of yet, I'm going with Lynch and the Hungarian. 
[00:19:00]  No, I think just a couple.  No, hey, show me up.  I don't care.  Mary knows how to bang, Anthony.  She knows how to bang.  Now, would you be open...  I didn't ask the Hungarian couple.  Would you guys be open for the two-point conversion?  Mike.  Two-point conversion.  The translation is happening.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's excited.  Oh, my God.  She's excited about it.  She's actually happy about it.  She's not compliant.  She's thrilled with the idea.  Oh, my God, Lynch.  You're in.  You're loving your couple. 
[00:19:30]  Happy birthday to me.  Yes, all right.  She's got the man of war over here.  Here we go.  By 30 lengths, it's Secretariat.  What happened, 30 days?  I'd find a round of our turn.  What about now, Mary?  You guys would do the two-point conversion?  Over the wire, Lynch's lovers.  What's that?  I'm ready.  She's got her own lotion.  Oh, you got lotion?  I'm going to rub the lotion.  What's the lotion of choice today, Mary?  It is Wet Platinum.  Wet Platinum.  Green and moisturizing lubricant.  And what do you have, the Hungarian? 
[00:20:00]  Silk E.  Silk E.  I think it's KY Black.  Silk E.  Any other things you brought with you?  No.  And did you guys bring anything else?  No.  All right.  Well, good luck to you.  John and Mary.  John and Mary.  Very good.  Ross's couple.  Oh, man.  Let's bring the hat around.  Who's picking next?  Cheater Rick.  Cheater Rick.  Cheater Rick.  It's time to pick your couple.  Cheater Rick.  All right, Rick. 
[00:20:30]  Go grab your...  Hey, can I play this much of it?  Chuck!  Chuck!  Chuck!  You own 50 cents.  All right, Rick.  Rick is picking his couple out of the hat.  You got a couple number five, Rob and Jamie.  Rob and Jamie.  Rob and Jamie.  All right.  All right.  Rob sporting a...  What is that?  A cheetah skin striped jacket thing. 
[00:21:00]  Get the backwards hat, the mirrored sunglasses.  You're looking incognito.  Kind of cool, like you're ready to bang in public.  I don't know what I'm ready for, but we'll find out.  Oh, Rick.  Uh-oh.  Rick's couple.  Oh, they seem a little nervous.  How long have you two been together?  Like two and a half years.  Two and a half years.  All right.  And has the sex slacked off at all?  Oh, God, no.  You're still just like rabbits going at it.  Very good.  Any strategy today?  Strategy?  Yeah, but we don't want to say it. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, that's good.  All right.  All right.  Would you be up to the two-point conversion?  Absolutely.  It's going to be my first time.  Oh, wow.  It looks like there's not going to be many two-point conversions.  Uh-oh.  Look at what I'm holding up.  It looks like I'm a rat.  It's in the hole.  It's my house.  It's a couple.  Look what we just found.  Some contraband.  If you recognize these diamond-shaped blue pills from Pfizer, this is Viagra. 
[00:22:00]  What do you have some, too?  And we just got them.  They were holding out.  Don't you guys have to pop those by now?  I know what the guy did.  I'm following the strategy of the gentleman from last year.  Very good.  Have you taken them yet?  Have you taken any?  You can see by the smile on my face.  And these are extra strength Viagra.  I might add.  Oh, my God.  A couple that is up here now.  Rick's couple.  Do you guys have anything extra that you're bringing along to help out?  Well, I tried the horny Goey for the first time today.  Oh, you did?  We'll see how it works.  So you popped some of that. 
[00:22:30]  But that's good.  Anything else?  Any lubricants?  Any medication?  What do you got?  Oh, my God.  I said lubricants.  She just stuck her tongue out.  Fan-effing-tastic.  Is she wearing panties under that lovely skirt?  Take them off.  There go the panties.  The game is afoot.  And are you wearing anything easily accessible to you, sir?  G-shorts.  Bring them down.  Ready to go.  That's it.  Ready to go.  All right.  Very good.  I'm not noticing a lot of camouflage-worthy shirts, though. 
[00:23:00]  Like, I would think if you're going to be pulling down those pants, you better be wearing something akin to a smock.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Something a little longer?  Sure.  A little longer, so you can really hide what you're doing.  All right.  That's Rick's couple.  Let's move on to Ben.  Stinky's gone.  All right.  Stinky.  Stinky.  What couple?  I got a couple for Cornell and Inez.  Bring them up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Inez.  All right.  Winners.  Nice to meet you, the winners.  That's right.  That's right.  Inez just made a pot, which she's very proud of.  Come on.  Pee-wee's a big adventure. 
[00:23:30]  Who is it?  Cornell and who?  Inez.  Inez?  I'm going with Stinky's couple, man.  Yeah.  The brother representing.  Fine choice, I might add.  Representing.  How long have you guys been seeing each other?  About two, two and a half years.  Nice.  Two and a half years?  Yep, yep.  All right.  How do you do it on a regular basis?  Absolutely.  Have you done it in public?  Yeah.  Where do you guys do it in public?  Anywhere.  Anywhere?  Wow.  Take it, Cornell.  Yeah, Cornell.  Look at him.  Yeah.  I'm going with Stinky's couple, man. 
[00:24:00]  That's right.  Any strategy?  It's Carson Opie.  I know.  Any strategy today?  Yeah, hit and run.  Hit and run?  Hit and run.  Nice.  Very good strategy.  Figures the black guy would say that.  Oh.  That's all right.  Oh.  Come on.  Come on.  What?  What happened?  What happened?  Sometimes you've got to take one for the team.  All right.  Now, again, we've got to ask, are you open to the, no pun intended, are you open to the  two-point conversion?  Two thumbs up.  Two thumbs up.  Always.  Always.  We have it any other way. 
[00:24:30]  Wow.  Well, that is Stinky's couple.  And by default, the last couple belongs to Ben.  Let's bring them up to the mics here.  What are your names?  Or the names you want to use?  Yeah, name, Simon.  Jolene.  And Simon and Schuster?  Simon and Jolene.  And Jolene.  Simon and Jolene.  Been together how long?  Like a year.  A year?  Still very constant in your banging?  Oh, yeah.  Very good.  24 years old in Latin.  Oh, there you go. 
[00:25:00]  Latin.  And is she wearing panties?  Easy access skirt type thing?  Yeah, I'm easy access.  And you, sir?  I have my shirt ready to go.  Yeah, he's got a longer shirt.  Yeah, see?  That's very good.  Do you have anything extra that you brought along to help you out?  Any lubricants?  No, we don't need any.  He just held up by a very special finger.  That's his lubricant.  You might want to fluff before you leave, right?  Very.  I think we're just about ready to go here, right?  Yep.  I think the couple should come up with a team name so it makes it easier to follow on the radio? 
[00:25:30]  You guys think you can come up with a team name real fast before you leave?  I do need a list of names, team names, and spotters that will be in front of us.  Yeah, we got like the Hungarian couple.  I mean, you guys come up with a team name really fast, right?  I think the Hungarian Humpers.  The Hungarian Humpers.  That's a good team right there.  All right, right there.  Hungarian Humpers.  We like that.  That's Lynch's team.  Oh, my good gosh.  All right, they're thinking of names for their teams. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Should we take a break and then we'll set the couples...  We could do that and then we'll send them on their way and start Sex for Sam 2.  Nice.  On the European Anthony Show.  Jim Cook on the way as Master of Ceremonies, all right?  I'm sure he's very proud.  The sex begins in just a few.  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come here for the news.

[00:28:00]  Yeah, we are.  It's a great day for sport.  The couples are psyched.  The spotters are psyched.  Beautiful weather for it.  Not too warm.  And I think it's going to be a very successful Sex for Sam 2.  Are you guys psyched or what, huh?  Yeah.  They're all getting liquored up.  Because what goes hand in hand with Sex?  Booze.  Right.  Got to be all liquored up.  Viagra and beer. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Viagra and beer.  Good always.  Best combination ever.  Rick's bringing in the master list.  What time are we supposed to report back to this time frame?  Contest over at what?  Six o'clock?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll return here at six.  Can I raise a practical question at this point?  No, we're not going to effing do stoning.  We can call after the event, right?  We don't have to call in during the event? 
[00:29:00]  Very helpful to call during the event.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very helpful.  That way you get the play-by-play.  Yeah.  All right.  If you think something is definitely going to happen, then, yeah, you've got to try to  give us a call.  We've just got some good combos set up, and I don't know how the logistics are going to  work.  Combos are good.  We'll just sit there and go, well, okay, here we are.  We're doing it.  And then you describe what goes on.  By the way, you guys don't have to be backed by sex.  Oh, really?  The effing stops at sex and then get back to the station.  It's going to be hard for everybody to get back here, then, by the time we get off the 
[00:29:30]  air.  We'll have a post wrap-up.  Yeah.  Yeah, try to get close to the station by six.  Yeah.  Rick, we got the team names?  The team names.  All right.  Here we go.  Ah, the official paperwork.  Oh, God.  All right.  All right.  We have five teams.  Stephen Lynch's team, the Hungarian Humpers.  That's Mickey and Timmy.  Voss, his team of Mary and John, the AK-47s. 
[00:30:00]  That is so funny.  Rick, cheating Rick, who has the team of Rob and Jamie.  They're named the C-Blockers.  C-Blockers.  All right.  Very good.  Sure.  Stinky has Cornell and Inez, and that's Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Or the Winners, whatever one.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:30:30]  Ben, or Stinky getting all cocky.  Ben, do you?  I've got to ask Ben really fast.  Are you confident with your couple?  Because you were really excited.  I'm pumped.  Okay.  I'm ready to rock.  I'm going to kick Stinky's ass.  Yeah, right.  Now, Ben's team, Simon and Jolene, the C-A-C, the CAC.  What is that?  C-A-C.  What does C-A-C mean?  When you put it like that, it sounds a little funny.  The actual, it's the Cuban-Armenian connection.  Well, CAC.  CAC. 
[00:31:00]  C-A-C.  Spells CAC to me.  So, good luck.  All right.  There are teams.  They'll be sent out.  We have a list of the locations, the point values, and we'll be looking forward to hearing  from everybody from their first location to kick off Sex for Sam 2.  Where the hell is Jim Cook, that drunk?  He'll be here soon.  He decided to do another radio show.  Oh, was he?  What an idiot.  What show is he on?  Is he across the street?  Yeah.  Oh, please. 
[00:31:30]  He's not going to have fun.  What a dope.  Come over here.  You have fun.  We'll make fun of him when he gets here.  I thought I was on your show.  I'm so hammered.  I've been drinking Sam Adams all day, and I really thought I was on the Opie and Anthony  show.  One half of a couple that was supposed to be here today, but didn't make it.  Lydia.  Yes.  What happened to you guys?  Well, we couldn't get a cigarette this morning.  Oh, you're the couple that wanted to conceive during the contest today.  Yeah, we were going to give it a shot. 
[00:32:00]  You know, Jim Norton could have babysat for you.  I know.  Why don't you give him a call?  He loves babysitting.  Does he like to change a poopy diaper?  Stomping, punching, whatever.  He'll change a poopy diaper and clean him up with his own junk.  Oh, that's lovely.  Put a handy wipe over his own garbage and just start swabbing.  Swabbing your little toddler.  Oh, God.  Nice.  You have lost your mind.  Nice.  Well, you guys can come in and try to conceive live on our radio show in the future.  Meaning where?  Like in front of you?  No. 
[00:32:30]  We don't really need to see it, but as long as you're in the area.  As long as you're in the area.  That sounds fine.  We had a couple.  She was past her due date.  Remember that couple, Anthony?  Yeah, she wanted to have a baby.  And we wanted to induce labor.  We tried to induce labor with a girl that was well over nine months pregnant,  and they were having sex all over the place.  Because we heard that sex induces labor sometimes.  Yeah.  So he had a bent over a couch, and he's just slamming away.  And then we had Rick making her work out and exercise, because we heard that could do it.  Yeah, walking.  Walking up and down stairs and doing jumping jacks and jumping rope. 
[00:33:00]  Rick was yelling at her.  That was a great day, but unfortunately we didn't have a live birth on our show, which we were going for.  Oh, wow.  But you guys could conceive in the future.  Let's go.  All right.  Rick's got your number, right?  Yes, he does.  All right.  They're getting all edgy.  All right.  They're getting very edgy.  All right.  Let me get the music going here.  Anthony.  Ah, there it is.  Sex for Sam 2.  Sex for Sam 2.  Here it is.  Here is the day where the talking stops and the effing begins.  And the teams are leaving the studio. 
[00:33:30]  It's like Cannonball Run.  I love it.  Yeah, yeah.  They are running down the hall.  There they go.  Lynch's Hungarian humpers.  Moss' AK-47s.  There it is.  Look at the confident look on Stinky's team.  Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Rick's C-blockers.  Yes.  And, of course, Ben with Team CAC.  Team CAC.  C-A-A-C.  There they go.  There they go.  All of them very excited.  Stinky giving a final victory.  Yes.  Very confident of his team.  Lynch, what did you forget? 
[00:34:00]  Lynch coming in confused.  And then running back down.  I look forward to this event every year.  Opie, you know, there's Wimbledon.  There's the World Series.  There's the Super Bowl.  The Triple Crown.  The Triple Crown.  Just legendary sporting events over the years.  But I don't think they compare to Sex for Sam.  No.  And now that we have the second one coming up here today,  I see a yearly tradition that is going to get bigger and bigger every year. 
[00:34:30]  We're going to have to bring it to other cities.  Yeah.  There are a lot of confused people outside the studio, man.  Rick, why are you still around?  Because I've got to make sure everybody's got set with Metro cards and cash.  So now we're running.  Ah.  There you go.  So that way they can take the trains.  They've got enough cash if they've got to get into some of these places that I'm looking at might cost some money.  We could say a movie theater.  Movie theater is on the list.  And that might cost a little bit of money to get into.  All right.  Let's go to Leo.  Leo.  Yo. 
[00:35:00]  Hey, Leo.  What's up?  Okay.  So who's getting fired today?  Well, there's kind of a poll going on to see who's going to get fired today.  We should have had.  Remember not, Ken Stevens' office.  We should have had 100 points for Ken Stevens' office if you have the balls to do it.  It still might happen, Anthony.  It's tradition, you know.  It is tradition.  It is tradition.  We've got to keep the tradition alive.  But for the new cities, last year when we played this, one of our spotters got fired because their couple had the two-point conversion type of sex. 
[00:35:30]  On our boss, Ken Stevens' couch.  Leather couch.  Yeah.  While everyone looked on and while our program director was freaking out saying, no, no, don't you do this.  Psychomark just went ahead and had his team do it anyway.  I lost his job.  Anthony, our first team checking in, Rick and the C-Blockers.  Rick.  Yeah.  Where are you?  We're right over here.  We're right over here, guys.  Where are you?  You're on our list.  I consider you a celebrity.  What? 
[00:36:00]  I was going to stand right in front of the door.  We're not celebrities.  We're not celebrities.  We're not celebrities.  We've been on TV.  No, it won't work that way.  Come on.  Come on, guys.  Here they come.  Oh, no.  He's having a problem.  What's the matter?  What's going on?  It's right outside the studio.  It's right outside the door.  I can't see a thing.  Hold on.  Hold on.  She's giggling.  What's going on?  Let me see.  Let me see.  I can't.  I can't even see through the glass door. 
[00:36:30]  They're making out and trying to get something going.  I didn't think the competition would start right outside our studio door.  Right outside the door.  Oh, you know what?  I see you guys are celebrities now with, you know, the big TV and magazines that you're  always in.  Hey, it's not in front of us if they're not doing it.  Oh, my God.  We don't see it, so it's no point.  We don't see it.  No point.  No point.  I don't know what they're doing.  I haven't seen anything.  I haven't seen anything.  It's not in front of me.  Go inside.  Quick.  I haven't seen nothing.  Go inside.  It's not in front of me.  I haven't seen nothing. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  The couple is inside the studio.  Oh, my God.  I don't want to see it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  There he goes.  And I've got confirmation.  There it is.  There it is.  Confirmation.  There it is.  All right.  There's your points.  All right.  Thank you.  Wow, Rick.  Thank you.  Pull the quick thing.  The judges have said we are indeed celebrities, hoping.  And we are now leaving the building for our next location.  And see you guys later. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  There goes Rick.  Rick, I need a scoring pen.  Yeah, we need some pens.  Rick is on the board.  Nice strategy right there, Anthony.  Thank you.  Rich Voss checking in with the AK-47s.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't say that because they'll dump out.  What?  Voss' couple is inside the Carnegie Deli, Anthony.  No, Carnegie Hall.  Oh, Carnegie Hall.  Carnegie Hall.  Oh, Carnegie Hall.  All right.  We're done.  They just finished.  They just finished at Carnegie Hall.  At Carnegie Hall. 
[00:38:00]  At Carnegie Hall.  All right.  And that's a 20-pointer.  Yeah, and it was in, and we're out of here.  All right.  Get out.  All right.  Thanks, Voss.  All right.  There goes Voss and the AK-47s, Anthony.  I can't find, oh, that was 30 points for Rick's team.  Very clever and cheating, Rick.  All right.  Ben's team checking in.  Ben's team.  I mean, it sucks.  We just got nailed in the ATM two years in a row, so we're on to the next occasion.  We just got thrown out by security.  They almost got to the point we needed to get, but we got tossed, so now we're running 
[00:38:30]  to the next account.  Ben, once again, trying that ATM for the second consecutive year.  The ATM didn't work for him last year.  Why is he trying again this year?  I don't know why he would try again.  All right.  Real fast, Anthony, if you're keeping track at home, Rick's couple had sex in front of us.  That was horrific.  The guy pulls down his pants, and he had this big bruise on his butt.  And they indeed got the points.  They got the points, and then Voss checked in from Carnegie Hall, and there was some action  going on there.  You're keeping, you got the master list, right, Ed? 
[00:39:00]  Yes.  So who's got the early lead, Rick?  Right now, yes, Rick with 30 points.  All right.  For just in front of us.  Who knew?  I didn't, I actually didn't even think of that.  Leave it to cheating Rick.  Right.  To come up with that one.  I wonder why he wasn't leaving.  Everyone else ran out of here, and he was kind of lagging.  Steve, what's up?  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, that's the closest Rich Vossov get to Carnegie Hall, that prick.  You know, there's always time, even during Sex with Sam 2, for a Voss bash. 
[00:39:30]  Why not?  Chris, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's wrong with you fools, man?  You guys should have put the studio on your list, and then you could have watched all  them girls getting banged.  We just saw one of the couples.  Yeah, but you could have had them all in there getting banged, because it would have been  on the list.  Maybe some of the other couples will be doing that when they get back by 6 o'clock.  Well, I hope you guys aren't fags or none.  All right, Chris.  Because that should have been the first on your list.  Yeah, that's it.  Glad you're listening, because it was the first on Rick's list, you idiot.  Now, neither of those was a conversion, which I'm very surprised about. 
[00:40:00]  I thought the two-point conversions would be starting early, especially with the enthusiasm  of the teams.  But I was wrong.  Hey, John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  15-point conversion for anybody who completes at any one location.  No, that would kind of wreck you for at least an hour, I think.  And then how the hell are you going to confirm that?  Who's going to want to really make sure that happened? 
[00:40:30]  I'll just drink my summer ale and just make Vaseline run like water.  All right, yeah.  Thanks, John.  No, the rules are in place, and it looks like another team is checking in, Anthony.  I hope this is Lynch's team.  No, it's Stinky's team, Pebbles and Bam Bam, Cornell and Inez, Stinky checking in.  Stinky.  All right, guys.  We're on the top of the roof of the building.  Well, I'm like toward the inside, and they're, uh, he just, he got helped out, and now they're  kissing, and I hope they're going to go for it soon. 
[00:41:00]  I don't know.  Wait, you're on the roof of this very building?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Are we the first to call in at least?  No.  No.  Oh, what kind of crap is that?  That's all right.  Are they doing the deed?  No, they're just kissing now, trying to get into the mood.  Uh, a lot of valuable time being taken up for what amounts to a ten-pointer.  Oh, B.  Her, uh, her dress is up.  Uh, Stinky, maybe you would want to egg them on for the two-point conversion, since this  is such a low-scoring, uh, location.  Only ten points. 
[00:41:30]  Only ten points, but we're going for two points, or no?  Uh, I'm going to put two points, though.  They're going for two points.  They're going for two points.  You've got to go for the conversion on such a low-scoring, uh, location.  Oh, my God, yes, her eyes are closed shut, and her heads are up against the wall, and  they're close, boy.  Yes, we have 12 points.  All right.  12 points!  There's ten points with the two-point conversion.  Mark it down.  All right, Stinky, move on to the next location, all right?  See you, guys.  All right, there goes Pebbles and Bam Bam. 
[00:42:00]  They just had some sex on the roof of this very building.  And the conversion for a total of 12 points.  Voss' AK-47's checking in again.  Voss?  Yeah, we just came out of a hotel.  We were in the elevator.  I couldn't call you in the elevator because we weren't getting any, uh, whatever, you  know, so.  A signal, all right.  So we just did, uh, the hotel.  Now we're headed across the street.  Can I tell you where we're going, or?  No, not yet.  Well, if they want.  Oh, really?  Yeah, whatever strategy they want to use.  We're right across the street from Carnegie Deli.  We're going over there.  Oh, no. 
[00:42:30]  We'll probably go, uh, maybe I'll, you know, my picture's hanging on the wall in Carnegie  Deli.  Maybe they can do it right under that.  All right, well, uh, call in when that's going to happen, all right?  Well, we're right across the street.  We're going to be walking in right now, so.  All right, uh, so Voss got the hotel, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got the hotel.  We got, uh, we're on fire.  Now, Voss, uh, no conversions for your team so far?  No conversions.  We're going to say that to close probably later.  Oh, right.  Well, that's a strategy.  You don't want to do the conversion right up front, you know?  All right.  All right.  You've got to end with something good.  All right, Voss, we've got to let you go. 
[00:43:00]  Steven Lynch on the phone now with the Hungarian humpers, uh, Mickey and Timmy.  Steven.  It's magic in Times Square.  The humping Hungarians are doing the deed in the back of a cab.  In the back of a cab in Times Square?  In Times Square.  I believe that's a double whammy.  That's a combo.  That is a combo.  All right, so, uh, ten points for the cab.  Fifteen points for, uh, Times Square.  We'll be calling back very shortly.  All right, thank you, Lynchie.  All right, goodbye.  And Lynch's team is on the board, and no surprise, Anthony, Ben's team's not on the board yet. 
[00:43:30]  Ben's team, once again, uh, shut out so far.  Yeah.  Uh, I do believe Rick is on the line now.  Rick with the C-Blockers, Rob and Jamie.  Rick, I hear music.  Yes, that is a lovely sound system here in the Hard Rock Cafe, guys.  Which is?  I'm looking at a Blues Brothers briefcase full of Blues gold record, and I'm watching my  couple enjoy an intimate moment right by a table they've selected.  That is a theme restaurant, which if I look on the list.  But no two points.  No two points.  We got a blast.  All right, bye. 
[00:44:00]  All right, bye.  There he goes.  Opie, maybe you can help me out.  I cannot find, oh, there it is.  15 points for the theme restaurant.  Yes.  Wow.  The points just racking up here.  No conversion there, I guess.  It is the duty of the spotter to tell us if it is indeed a two-point conversion.  We're going to take a quick break, Anthony.  We should get a point total and tell everyone who's winning just before we take a break.  All right.  Let me get that really quick.  Hold on.  Ben's team checking in.  Let's see if they can get on the board.  It's the CAC team.  Ben. 
[00:44:30]  We are on the board.  You're on the board.  Where are you?  The lovely Hudson Hotel.  Here we go out of here now before we get out.  So, in the hotel, which is a ten-pointer.  What part of the Hudson Hotel, Ben?  The hallway leading into the bathroom area.  Very nice.  Very nice.  We're on our way out to the next location.  All right.  The Hudson Hotel, a very trendy spot in New York.  Yes.  Oh, no.  What happened?  There we go.  Hi, celebrities.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[00:45:00]  Come on.  Come on.  Is this Stinkies team?  Let's go.  Let's go.  All right.  Bring Jim Cook in while the couple gets ready.  Oh, no.  Not Jim Cook.  Jim Cook is a celebrity, too.  Oh, no.  I can't see that.  Oh, no.  Hey, Jim.  Oh, no.  Hey, Jim.  What's up?  Ah!  Wow.  Hey, there's some, yeah.  She's a little tonsil hockey.  Sure.  Why not?  What's going on right there to get the athletes prepared for the competition? 
[00:45:30]  Jim, why don't you grab a mic?  We're doing this for you, pal.  Not that.  A mic.  I'm so proud.  All right.  Wow.  I'm very distracted.  Okay.  Well, this doesn't count for points.  Officially, there's no points going on.  Well, not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Okay.  Voss wants to check in as the other couple is doing a little thing here in front of us.  In front of us.  Yes.  Voss.  Am I on?  Yes.  The AK-47 is checking in again. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  We're in a bathroom at the Carnegie Deli.  Hold on.  He has entered.  Have you entered?  What?  We have entered the bathroom and he has entered.  Yes.  The bathroom at the Carnegie Deli.  Carnegie Deli.  The Carnegie Deli.  Voss, just getting points left and right here.  Thank you, Voss.  Let's get out of here.  Let's go.  Bye.  The bathroom in the Carnegie Deli, Anthony.  How much does that worth?  That is worth 10 points.  Okay.  If, oh my God, he's not, he's plugging his ears.  There's stuff going on.  Maybe, okay, you know, maybe he doesn't want to hit on the competition and this is his freak 
[00:46:30]  fetish, man.  Dude, okay, we get it.  Is there, um, anything, uh, turn it off.  Turn it off.  I learned in the elevator that, uh, Bant or Pebble will only go for the two-point conversion  every time.  That's the way she likes it.  Oh.  That's the way she likes it. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Well, Pebbles, I don't know what the hell Pebbles and Bam Bam are doing here in the corner.  I mean, I know what they're doing, but it has nothing to do with the competition.  Well, we got to take a break.  Yeah.  So maybe we should give a total and, uh, see what happens after the break with, uh, Stinky's  team, Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Um, are they, are they going to attempt to get points on the board, Stinky?  You're there soon.  I mean, this is how it's going on the roof.  All right.  Hopefully soon.  We'll start the break and, you know, we'll hopefully have an update in the middle of the  break.  Right.  All right. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  Now they're making out and, uh, it's getting interesting over there.  It's sex for Sam, too.  In the studio, Jim Cook.  A quick, uh, point total, Anthony?  Uh, Stephen Lynch and his Hungarian Humper.  With 25 points.  Okay.  And, uh, Rick and the C-Blockers, 45 big points.  That puts them in the lead.  Voss with the AK-47, close behind, 40 points.  Stinky with Pebbles and Bam Bam here, uh, 12 points because they got the 10 and the  two-point conversion, which puts them in the lead over Bam's team with only 10 points.  That two-point conversion, very important here. 
[00:48:00]  Separating, uh, fourth and fifth place.  Very nice.  And we'll be back.  And we'll see what the hell happens with Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Man, they're just really going at it behind us here.  The Goapy and Anthony Show.  Oh, they're wrong, baby!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah.  Sure.  Anthony!  Yes!  Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  I guess some of the teams are using the Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed today. 
[00:48:30]  That's what I'm hearing.  Nice!  Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  It's a botanical complex.  And what does it do?  It enhances libido and sexual performance.  The one thing these couples really need today.  It's based on the latest scientific research into sexual performance and well-being.  Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  The only formula clinically tested, doctor-recommended, and proven right here on the Opie and Anthony  Show.  In a recent study conducted by a Manhattan internist, 60% of the male participants reported positive  benefits using Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  One couple said that Horny Goat Weed made their already torrid sexual activities earth-shattering. 
[00:49:00]  Earth-shattering.  Picking up at GNC, the vitamin shop, and other vitamin retailers.  Call them up.  1-800-899-5323.  1-800-899-5323.  Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  They're using it today on the show.  And you see what it's doing for them.  You're going to love it.  Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  Now, this is 1027 WNEW, New York. 
[00:49:30]  All right, Anthony, we are back.  Sex for Sam 2.  What are you laughing at?  Well, a few things happened here in the studio during commercials.  And Frankie, I just read what he wanted to talk about on 910.  You want me to just go to him real fast?  Yeah.  Okay.  Frankie.  Dude.  Yeah.  I'm going to blow chunks, man. 
[00:50:00]  I can't believe she played tonsil hockey after he went for the two-point conversion.  Yeah.  That's just so disturbing, man.  Oh, hello.  Yeah, they got the stinkiest team.  And then he kissed her.  Pebbles and Bam Bam had the 12 points because they went for the two-point conversion.  Up on the roof.  Up on the roof, their first location.  Yeah.  Then they decided to come into here so they could do it and get points for having it in  front of a celebrity.  Which is Jim Cook.  That's right.  I'm so proud to be part of such a romantic moment. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  You're going to have to gargle with Sam Adams, man.  Oh, yeah.  And she was fluffing him, as they say in the industry, to get everything ready.  And, yeah, as Frankie points out, they had just been on the roof getting the two-point  conversion.  Oof.  And then they came down here and she fluffed.  And then during commercials, they completed.  They did that whole thing in front of the celebrity, which brings their total up to 44.  And there was a two-point conversion there, Anthony.  Yeah, they want to do the two-point conversion at every location, which is key. 
[00:51:00]  Now they have 44 points.  We've got to play catch-up here now.  Yeah, let's...  Because we've got a lot of the participants on the phone.  All right, let's go to Ben.  Ben, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Well, you guys have been on break.  We hit Central Park and we just did a cab going down Broadway.  And now we're in Times Square going to our next location.  I'm gone!  This guy's rocking, man.  We're doing well.  So where did you guys do it in Central Park?  Behind a tree or something?  Yeah, we went over kind of in a bushes near what looked like some sort of bathroom or something 
[00:51:30]  over in a corner and did it.  Okay.  And I got out of there because some black chick was looking at us like, what the hell is going on?  And then what happened in the cab?  In the cab, they did it in the cab as we headed down Broadway.  And we jumped out.  Traffic got pretty crazy in Times Square.  And now we're off to our next spot.  Any two-point conversions?  No, my couple isn't into the two-point conversions.  They're going to try to make it up on quantity.  Yeah, you are, because I'll tell you something, Pebbles and Bam Bam into the two-point conversion  could make all the difference.  All right, Ben, we've got to let you go.  Everyone else is checking in. 
[00:52:00]  All right, bye.  Let's go.  Lynch has been waiting for a while.  Steven Lynch and the Hungarian Humphers, Anthony.  Ah, yes.  If it's your stomach that needs to work out, why not try a helping of Hungarian goulas  at Planet Hollywood, located in beautiful Times Square.  Ah, theme restaurant.  Now, did they already have a Times Square?  Yeah, we're not trying to go for another ten points.  We wanted the theme restaurant, though.  You got the theme restaurant, though.  Which is 15 points.  Thank you.  Very good. 
[00:52:30]  We are now going to an area that's going to include a rooftop, a hotel, and a movie theater.  So I should be calling back shortly.  Oh, my God.  That's a nice combination, Lynch.  Thank you.  All right, there you go.  Steven Lynch and the Hungarian Humphers, Anthony.  There is indeed a strategy here as far as the locations you hit.  If you could do the combos and get in and out quickly of these locations, you're going  to be getting the points, getting them quick, and moving on to the next location.  Very good.  Steven Lynch's team, the Hungarian Humphers.  Let's check in with the C-Blockers. 
[00:53:00]  Rick, what's going on?  Rob and Jamie.  Yes, Anthony.  We're here live at a beautiful Ian Schrager Hotel, located in midtown Manhattan, where  my female just had to orally take care of some information that was needed in a certain  southern region.  Okay.  And as we have a good view of the lobby, I turn to my right.  Hold on.  The skirt is up.  Yes, we do have a conversion of just a regular hotel. 
[00:53:30]  No two points.  No two points.  But I'm running for the door because somebody with a hotel is coming.  I've got to go.  All right, there we go, the C-Blockers.  Let's check in with Voss and the AK-47s.  Voss.  Listen to me.  I am so proud of my couple.  They were standing outside Radio City, right, looking for a place to get inside.  We got thrown out of there.  Yeah.  Right out front, leaning on the wall, he starts doing it on 6th Avenue.  People were walking by with disgust.  This lady looked at them, and I swear to God, she hated every part of New York City when 
[00:54:00]  she saw them doing it.  Hate them if you want, but that's 15 points for Radio City.  Radio City is a call.  Standing on 6th Avenue.  We're going over to Rockefeller Center now.  Yeah.  I got my couple.  See, my couple's cool.  We do it right out in the open.  We don't care.  Well, see, that's a great strategy, too.  None of that pesky opening and closing doors and privacy.  Right when they were done at Radio City, a cop drove by.  Oh.  All right.  We're going over to Rockefeller Center. 
[00:54:30]  All right, Voss.  All right.  I'll check in.  Thank you.  We have audio Anthony of a tourist as he checks out Voss's couple.  Oh, really?  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's in the hose.  Let's check in with Stinky.  The point's just mounting here now.  We've got some great couple this year.  If I could use the word mounting.  Yes, you can.  Stinky.  Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Hey, guys, we ran out of the studio, ran across the street to the Hard Rock,  went up to the bathroom, and handed it off to get the two-point conversion. 
[00:55:00]  Fifteen points for the restaurant, two for the conversion, for a total of 17 points.  And now we're in Central Park looking for a homeless and a hot dog vendor for the three combo.  The combo platter.  Hey, Stinky, thanks for the view before, by the way.  Pebbles and Bam Bam having just all-out sex in front of us.  Thank you for that.  No problem.  They enjoyed it.  Uh, Rachel enjoyed that.  Rachel was like...  A little too much, actually.  Yeah.  Rachel was getting turned on a little bit by that one.  Ooh.  All right.  All right.  All right, Stinky. 
[00:55:30]  We'll call you back when we get to the park.  Okay, good.  There goes Stinky and Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Jim Cook in the studio.  Jim, how are you?  Jim.  Well, I'm doing great.  It was just a little tough sucking down my Sam Adams after that.  Like, should I put this in my mouth that's long and brown?  And it foams when I agitate it.  Right.  Yeah, you walked right in on, uh...  You know, you walked in on a lot of stuff going on in this studio. 
[00:56:00]  But when he opened the door, looked over to his right, and just saw a couple just giving the, uh, what they call, uh, oral treats.  Yeah.  Um, that was pretty much the, the most you've seen, uh, on the show.  It stopped me from putting the bottle in my mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  As well it should.  Yeah.  Oh, and Cornell keeping those stereotypes alive, by the way.  Oh, my God.  I saw the videotape, because Steve was taping it.  Steve's taping it to make his own porno collection.  He's all excited, though.  He's running around.  Look, I got, I got footage of them. 
[00:56:30]  And then he goes, and they also had sex in my studio.  You want to see that one?  Look at this.  It reminded me of, uh, the internet clip I saw called Horse Gag.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You are wonderful on YSP.  They rule now.  Nice.  I love the YSP.  What's up?  I tell you, but hey, listen, how about at the end of the day to make it anybody's game?  And since you can't really follow it up, what do you say?  Double the bottom line points for a Pasadena mudslide.  I don't think we'll be bringing any of those, uh, things in, like the hot lunch, the hot Carl. 
[00:57:00]  Someone wants to know about the Roman war helmet.  No.  No?  No.  31 points for the Roman war helmet.  Jim doesn't even know what the Roman war helmet is.  Uh, we learned about that yesterday.  We were really new to this, too.  The Roman war helmet.  Um, what it is, is, uh, the, uh, guy, um, gets, uh, faces the girl's feet in bed.  You on to me so far?  Okay.  Um, the junk is, uh, pretty much in front of her face.  The yam bag, if you will, uh, gets separated. 
[00:57:30]  So, one yam each is over each eye.  And the junk itself is stretched down the bridge of her nose, thus looking like a Roman war helmet.  Oh, there you go.  It's also called the Gonzo, because it kind of looks like Gonzo from The Muppet Show.  Yeah.  Hey, Old Dirty's in the studio as well.  Yo, I'm chilling here with my man, Jim.  Yo, yo, Jimmy, let me tell you, my brother.  You see what's going on out here? 
[00:58:00]  Hey, people's getting the F off for the Sam Adams, dude.  What's up with that?  What's up with that?  When Old Dirty walks in and just goes, Jim Cook, my nigga, come here.  So, you hear that in many board meetings there, Jim?  No.  I think the stock just went up.  Yeah.  Yeah, brother.  O.D. loves the Sam Adams, man.  Dude, there's not one time that I have not drank this beer that it has not gotten me twisted.  There it is.  Put that in your ass. 
[00:58:30]  I'm just getting prouder and prouder.  Dude, I can't say enough about this brew, my nigga.  That should be your new slug line, Jim.  I would love to hear Jim say that, Anthony.  It'll get you twisted.  The beer that got old dirty messed up.  Hey, Stinky.  Stinky Pebbles and Bam Bam checking in again.  Oh, they're giving me the thumbs up.  She's up against a rock formation.  And the best part is he licks the dirty penny beforehand. 
[00:59:00]  Wow.  So, there's a one in Central Park, and there's a homeless guy sitting on top of the rock where they're in front of.  And we have four teenage perverts following us around now laughing at them.  Hey, and there was a two-point conversion there, Sting?  Yeah, two-point conversion.  Why am I asking?  Every location is going to be a two-point conversion.  Oh, be on each one.  That's ten points each.  But with the two-point conversion, it's twelve points each.  Total of twenty-four points.  Where normally, that would just be twenty points. 
[00:59:30]  The two-point conversion.  I'm going to come in really big for Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Oh, wait, you're doing like that Scrabble thing, I think.  Oh, absolutely.  If they do a combo, they get the conversion points for each location.  Triple word score.  Sure.  It's a triple word score.  I mean, if it didn't work for them that way, why wouldn't they just do it in front of the, in Central Park,  and then do it in front of the homeless guy?  Yeah.  And get the conversion.  Nice.  You get the combo, you get the points.  Very good.  Thank you, Ed.  All right, Sting.  All right, guys.  We're heading off to our next location.  Right on.  As you do that, we've got to check in with Lynch and the Hungarian Humper. 
[01:00:00]  Yes.  He is hoping heights aren't your phobies.  Beautiful Times Square Hotel.  All right, a hotel, which is ten points.  No, no, actually, we're not in a hotel.  We're in a converted hotel.  Well, actually, this is a converted hotel.  I don't know if that counts, but we're going for the roof of a building.  Oh, okay, roof of the building.  Well, you know, we'll take hotel if you count it.  No, that's also ten points.  Because this is a converted hotel.  No, Anthony's waving it off. 
[01:00:30]  No, I'm waving that off.  Okay, we'll go to the hotel, then.  All right.  Thank you, Louis.  But there you go, roof of a building.  All right.  All right, for ten points, bringing their total to 50 points so far,  which actually puts them in fourth place.  Ben's team better get on the money here.  I'm a little worried about Ben's team.  And they had the second year in a row with Ben.  They came on strong, but they're only doing ten-point locations.  They have three of them for 30 points.  Kickin' ass so far with the two-point conversions just coming in. 
[01:01:00]  Pebbles and Bam Bam, 85 points so far for the lead.  85 points.  Rick and Voss' team tied at 55 points apiece.  Lynch just behind with 50 points.  And poor Ben and team CAC, CAC, with only 30 points.  All right.  Well, should we start a commercial break?  We can break in if we get action.  We can do that, yes.  So we'll start the break, but we might break in.  So stay there.  It's Sex for Sam 2 in the studio.

[01:03:00]  All right, we're back.  It's the O.B.  and Anthony show.  If you're not in the New York area, give us a call.  Tell us what you think today.  866-2774.  Wow.  We're in the middle of Sex for Sam 2.  We'll completely explain it in a second because a lot of new people checking in.  Well, we got to check in with our spotters first, okay, Ed?  Yes.  Let's go right to Voss and the AK-47s.  Mary and John.  Voss.  Yeah, hey, we just killed two birds.  We went into Rockefeller Center into the NBC store, all right? 
[01:03:30]  So we did it there.  Not we.  They did.  I'm their coach.  And then we went into the Fox News building and did it there.  Wait.  You did it inside the Fox building?  Yeah, in the building at Fox News.  Is that on the list, Anthony?  It says Fox News.  Now, what did that mean?  Well, I mean, what did that mean?  It was in the Fox News building, right?  How many points is it?  It's 20 points.  Yeah, I guess.  Okay.  All right.  You can't break the doors down and get into Fox News. 
[01:04:00]  It says Fox News.  You're right in the building there.  All right.  You did.  They had some sex in the building at Fox.  And where else was it?  At the NBC store at Rockefeller Center.  So, Rockefeller Center.  Hey, you know what else?  Swear to God, we almost talked firemen to let them do it on a fire truck.  Oh, no.  It's not on the list.  I know, but we were just done it for extra publicity.  Just to do it.  Just to do it.  All right, Voss, we've got to let you go because everyone's checking in.  Hey, one question.  Isn't Hooters a theme restaurant? 
[01:04:30]  Yes.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's check in with Lynch and the Hungarian Humpers.  All right.  The Hungarian Humpers just got the two-point conversion.  Oh, my God.  Where?  At the Hotel Carter on 43rd Street.  My God.  That's 12 points.  And we are right now.  We have our tickets.  We're about to go into Tomb Raider and do a little archaeological dig, if you know what I mean.  For a movie.  I think they may go for a two-pointer here. 
[01:05:00]  We're not sure, but we'll find out.  All right.  Two-pointer.  They're nodding their heads, but we'll keep you informed.  So we just finished the hotel.  Thank you, Lynch.  And the Hungarian Humpers, they're buying movie tickets, Anthony.  Hey, that's the only way to get into the movies.  Here we go.  Here we go.  All right.  A crowd favorite, Anthony.  Stinky.  Stinky.  And Pebbles and Bam Bam, they have teenage perverts following them now all over the city.  The current leaders.  Stinky, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  We just left, let's just say, the hotel where Macaulay Culkin stayed in Home Alone 2. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, yeah?  We just left there, and we were by the desolate ATM machine up on the second floor.  So, plus two on both locations.  And now we are inside a desolate city bus, and here's the driver.  He just wants to say hi.  Okay.  Hey, how you doing?  These guys are crazy.  They're having sex on your bus, sir?  Yeah, they did.  Hey, use my bus any time.  Who cares?  All right.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Stinky just on fire. 
[01:06:00]  Right across the street from F.E.O. Schwartz, we're heading there now to check out the toys.  All right.  Thank you.  Give us a call.  See you, guys.  All right.  Wow.  Stinky just piling up the points.  They are getting so far into the lead.  I hope this isn't a blowout.  Who do we have on the line?  Hey, it's Ben here checking in.  Oh, finally, Ben.  We just hit the movie theater in the Virgin Megastore, which was just hilarious because  they were having the Urban Film Festival.  Yeah.  And we just finished that, and we did Planet Hollywood right before that. 
[01:06:30]  So, we're in good shape here.  Okay.  Hold on now.  I got to get this.  What's the location?  Theme restaurant, Planet Hollywood.  Theme restaurant.  That would be 15 points.  No conversions?  No conversions.  They're not going for the conversions.  And then a movie theater.  And a movie theater.  Very good.  What movie was playing?  Some urban movie festival.  We were the white people in there, dude.  Urban World.  Urban World.  Urban World.  Playing at 415 at the Virgin Megastore.  And how's the team holding up, Ben? 
[01:07:00]  They're doing well.  Well, you know, they're doing well.  They're worried that a couple, Bill and the two-point conversions, is getting in the lead.  But we're going to do something about that.  Well, some late news here on Stinky's team, Pebbles and Bam Bam.  The first team across the 100-point mark.  Wow.  They now have 126 points.  That's it.  Obviously.  In the lead.  What's the other point totals, Anthony?  The closest we have so far is Voss' team with 80 points. 
[01:07:30]  That's Mary and John, AK-47.  And then down on the list, we have Lynch, the Hungarian Humpers, really putting in an effort, but only 62 points.  They need some high-point areas, I think.  And then Ben's team.  Rick's team has 55 points.  And Ben's team also 55 points.  All right.  It's all right.  Yeah, and we still have an hour and a half left.  Sex for Sam, too.  A bunch of people want to know what the F we're doing today.  Yeah, I just got some instant feedback. 
[01:08:00]  People saying, what are you doing?  Just tuned in.  Well, it's Sex for Sam.  In order to win a trip up to the Sam Adams Brewery for a great party that Jim Cook puts on up there every year.  It's like a two- or three-day party.  Foo Fighters playing.  It's just a lot of fun.  The winner of this contest will go.  And in order to win, you have to get the most points.  To get the most points, we have made a list of popular locations around Manhattan.  And they have point values next to them.  The harder locations, much more valuable. 
[01:08:30]  And the lower location, like a cab, maybe 10 points.  But you get somebody where, like, in front of a celebrity, that's 30 points.  The team that scores the most will go to Boston to go to the brewery.  Now, the two-point conversion, confusing some people.  You've heard us use that term, two-point conversion.  That is the act at this location, which you get the points for.  You get an additional two points if you spin the girl around and do it, well, use the balloon knot. 
[01:09:00]  The balloon knot, the back door.  Yeah, a little back door action.  All right.  And Pebbles and Bam Bam, Stinky's team, oh, my God.  Every location has been the two-point conversion.  They are the experts at the two-point conversion.  It's really put them in the lead.  Doug, what's going down?  What's up, guys?  Stinky says he's got people following him.  By the end of the day, his couple's going to look like the Rocky movie.  I'm going to follow him through the park when he's running?  Well, Stinky said he has 14 perverts following him at this point. 
[01:09:30]  Take it easy, guys.  All right, bye.  Yeah, he picked them up.  They were all in the car, y'all.  I'm coming in.  Stinky goes, oh, dirty.  I'm like, shh, be quiet.  You know, you want to go a little incognito on the way out.  Hell yeah.  So then the four perverts are right there.  Boom, they lagged on.  Here's a little bit about the two-point conversion.  Opie, Pebbles and Bam Bam, who have been using it at every location, have gotten an additional  14 points just on two-point conversion.  That's more than a lot of locations on here.  They have done away with a location just doing two-point conversion. 
[01:10:00]  And we can confirm the two-point conversion.  We saw it with our own eyes.  Oh, yes.  Yes, we did.  Matt, what's going down?  Columbus chicken in here, Ant.  How's it going?  What's up?  Just listening, you guys.  I think your contest is pretty cool.  Oh, cool, man.  Well, I don't think we would ever go over here in Columbus, Ohio.  Somebody ended up arrested really quick.  Oh, no.  This is very...  You've got to be very covert.  That's right.  We're sneaky.  And you're rooting for Pebbles and Bam Bam, it looks like.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:10:30]  I've got to give it to them.  If they're going for the two-point conversion, I've got to say, attaboy, team.  All right.  Good job.  Yeah, they started with it early.  They're doing it throughout the whole competition.  I think it gives them a great advantage.  All right, best team checking in.  The CAC team, CAC.  I'm at Times Square.  We just got nailed.  We were about to be at Times Square.  I just ran at the Psycho Mark on the street and checking it out.  We just got screamed at by a security guy who we're about to do so.  We're going to maybe head over to Fox News now.  So you didn't get Times Square?  Dude, we were right there. 
[01:11:00]  We had a great spot.  And then all of a sudden, moving along, some dude on camera.  There's some screaming dude, so we've got to move on here.  Denied.  Denied.  It's Times Square.  We're moving on.  All right, Ben.  Thank you.  Wow.  That hurts for Ben's team, who's really in need of points here.  Only 55 points.  And now to be denied like that, have to take the time to go to a new location.  Opie, that's going to hurt.  Yes, it will, Anthony.  Let's check in with Stinky and Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  We're in crowded F.E.O. Schwartz right now. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, my God.  We found an elevator that was broken.  And we took the two kids, the perverts that are following us.  Yeah.  Had them guard the top and I guard the bottom.  And they're right in the middle of the escalator with all the kids around.  Right by the Barbie dolls.  They're on a broken escalator while kids are shopping all around them.  Holy, yes.  F.A.O. Schwartz, 15 points plus two points conversion.  Stinky.  Oh, Stinky and Pebbles.  These guys are professionals.  Well, that's obvious.  We saw it for ourselves.  That's right.  All right, Stinky.  All right, guys. 
[01:12:00]  See you.  There he goes.  I think to keep the competition fair, you've got to keep the perverts from participating  and assisting the couple.  No.  Let me tell you something.  No rules.  Anything goes here in this.  Anything goes?  There are no rules.  You could use whatever you need as far as maybe some kind of herbal supplement.  You could do whatever it takes.  As long as you're doing the act at these locations, you will get the points.  I don't care if they have people on guards guarding them.  I think we're going to, at the winter meetings, we're going to have to discuss this. 
[01:12:30]  No, that's what I love about this game.  There are no rules.  Stinky is using everything around him.  I love it.  Very resourceful.  He saw the team perverts following him.  He said, what the hell?  I'll, you know, have him help me.  Very resourceful.  Bravo.  Yo, but isn't Mary Psycho Mark's ex?  And what a coincidence.  He runs into Ben at 42nd, dude.  Wow, yeah.  Ow.  Ha!  She's getting railed, son.  All right.  Let's check it out.  Oh, dude.  Ben checking in again.  Ben back on the phone.  Hopefully, he can make up for that denial.  With the cat team. 
[01:13:00]  All right.  We found a new spot, and it looks like I'm on our Asian horse.  Oh, God.  We've got time to try.  You've got time square.  What location in time square, Ben?  We are on 7th and what street is this?  47th, right on the corner there, right inside a little doorway there.  Any of the tours looking at you guys?  Dude, we have horrified so many frigging people today.  It's horrendous.  We just, we horrified a family in Central Park, and now we're moving on. 
[01:13:30]  A couple people are looking at us.  Let's go.  All right.  Bye.  We're off.  All right.  There he goes, Ben.  There they go.  15 more points for time square.  Ouch.  Ben, now up to 70 points.  Now Rick in last place with only 55 points, and we haven't heard from him lately.  In a long time.  He had better be going to a big point location here.  All right.  Let's go to Sean.  Sean?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  You guys, I bow to you.  This is Radio Genius.  Oh, thank you.  This contest is unbelievable. 
[01:14:00]  The best thing I've ever heard on the radio ever.  Isn't it a lot of fun?  It's amazing.  You guys are genius.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Sean.  And have a sponsor.  Oh, I didn't mean to do that.  I'm sorry.  This is the second annual Sex for Sam.  Yeah.  We have to let the listeners know.  You know what I'm saying?  We're going to bring this to other cities.  Can you imagine doing it in Philadelphia?  It would be great in Philly, too.  There's a lot of landmarks in Philadelphia.  Yeah.  We're going to be broadcasting live in Philly sometime in October.  Maybe we'll bring this.  We'll bring Sex for Sam to Philly.  Absolutely.  I think they would enjoy it in Philly, and there's a lot of historic locations there. 
[01:14:30]  Yep.  Just imagine somebody having to do it on the Rocky Stairs.  Yeah.  What everybody says about Philly.  There's eight billion more locations.  I'd rather have them do it in the building that the police bombed when Move was in there.  Oh, wow, wow, wow.  Hey, I'm stepping on your feet, O.D.  What's up?  O.D., hold it up.  It's all good.  It's all good, baby.  Sam Adams is going to be all that up.  Oh, Dirty, I like you because you don't front.  Oh, there it is. 
[01:15:00]  Carson Opie again.  Carson Opie, yes.  We've got Stinky checking in once again with the two-point conversion team of Pebbles and Bam Bam, our leaders.  Stink?  Hey, guys.  We are leaving, what's the name of this place?  Bergdorf and Goodman, a department store.  That's what I got to see from FPL Schwartz.  There was so many security guards that they found some empty stairwell.  He was slapping her ass in celebration at one point.  It was the greatest.  Oh, my God. 
[01:15:30]  Now he's doing victory dances.  This team, truly professional, true athletes.  And a department store worth 10 points.  Of course, the two-point conversion brings it to 12.  That's right.  All right.  See you guys later.  That's a major high-end store.  Holy ass.  All right, Stink.  Pebbles and Bam Bam.  I got to tell you something about Pebbles and Bam Bam.  They're very quick between locations.  I don't know if this is luck or the fact that Stinky, their spotter, plotted out a course.  Stinky was very confident going into today's competition. 
[01:16:00]  He actually worked beforehand plotting the course out.  I don't think the other people took that into consideration.  And if you're running around the city, you're wasting a lot of time that you could be scoring some big points on Opie.  Let's check in with Greg.  Greg, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Stinky already has more points this year than the winner did last year.  Now, what did the winner have last year?  I believe it was.  $1.24.  $1.26.  Was it $1.24?  Something like that.  Because now, I'll tell you, Pebbles and Bam Bam, up to 155 points. 
[01:16:30]  And they're just pulling away from the pack here.  It's going to take a great effort and probably a lot of pain in order to catch this team.  Anthony, an hour and 15 minutes left in the competition, though.  Oh, my God.  Now, the thing is, a lot of people, yeah, can you pace yourself?  Can Pebbles and Bam Bam, you know, hold up?  Right.  With the two-point conversion, every time, I don't know how long Pebbles is going to be able to hold out.  There's always that goof factor.  If, you know, there's some completion going on, then you're going to have some downtime. 
[01:17:00]  Well, I don't know.  He might be able to stop the two-point conversion, go with the standard points to finish out if he finds himself that far in the lead, Opie.  I'm excited to see how this is going to turn out.  I can't believe Rick hasn't checked in in a while.  I hope he didn't get arrested.  There does seem to be a problem.  Rick peaked out here at 55 points.  The rest of the team is now pulling away quickly.  We have not even heard from Rick and his team, the C-blockers.  This is illegal, isn't it?  No, Rick, it is absolutely illegal, and you will be hauled away. 
[01:17:30]  It is illegal, isn't it?  Baloney sandwiches for Rick, and it is a Friday all weekend.  See you in Central Book and Punk.  We should explain to everybody that, yes, people do get arrested when they help the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, it is something that we've dealt with in the past.  The last time, 12 people were arrested for one of our little cute ideas.  Yeah.  That's why Louis Black is not participating today.  And Norton.  Morton Norton didn't want anything to do with this today. 
[01:18:00]  Voss and Lynch, all I could say, stupid.  Jim Cook, you having fun?  Oh, yeah.  Jim, I'd love to talk to you.  Excuse me, Rick on the phone right now.  What?  Very important that we speak with Rick.  Rick.  Rick.  Rick.  Rick.  Rick.  That didn't sound good, Jim.  Jim, that didn't sound very good.  Rick and the C-blocker.  Something weird is going on there.  The last time I heard a cell phone peter out like that, it was Psycho Marx in the back of the paddy wagon.  Remember?  Yeah, when he was hiding the weed. 
[01:18:30]  Dude, I'm in the paddy wagon.  They're coming around.  Oh, I got to go.  I got to put my handcuffs back on.  I got to put my handcuffs back on.  Yeah, he got his hands out of his cuffs to make a call.  Make a call.  Hopefully, this is Rick calling back again.  Hey, Jim, what's going on with the Sam Adams?  I don't see many.  Are you going to share today?  You couldn't share.  He's got the crazy cold joints in that bag.  Isn't that amazing?  He's got this big Sam Adams cooler.  You think he would have paperwork from the company and all that?  Hell no. 
[01:19:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey, Rick and the C-blockers checking in again.  What happened?  Yes, we are here, the C-blockers, at a monument of sorts, 26-time world champion, New York  Yankee Stadium.  Oh, my God.  And I'm standing about 10 feet from the big bat, and I've got my couple in full view,  and so does somebody else.  Uh-oh.  Now, Rick, this is what took them so long.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Uh-oh.  They're right in front of Yankee Stadium.  How much is Yankee Stadium, Anthony?  30 points. 
[01:19:30]  30 points.  That's a big one.  All right, nope, okay, they're good, they're good.  I thought it was a security guy, but no.  This was a brave move, Anthony.  Very brave.  Taking a lot of time to get uptown to Yankee Stadium.  But it's 30 points, so that's worth three, I would say, three 10-point locations, if  I may do some math.  Rick, what's going on, Rick?  Yeah, hold on, he's having a little bit of trouble.  Oh, my God.  It's the big money location.  He's having trouble.  Tell him to look at the big bat.  Frickin' A.  They got that huge bat in front of Yankee Stadium. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, he's shaking his head.  He's not happy.  Oh, no.  You know, this could be a turning point.  This could be a big turning point in the C-Blockers if they went through all this time to get  to a big money location.  Rick, tell him to look at the mound.  Oh, we have a home run.  We have a home run.  Yeah.  All right.  That's good.  That's good.  We're out.  We're out.  We have a home run right in front of Yankee Stadium.  30 points.  All right, Rick.  Was that what I think? 
[01:20:30]  Oh, my God, guys.  Yeah.  Guys, as she says, it was her first time.  There was an extra two points.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, there was a man on base.  Wow.  Wow.  There was a man on base.  We are heading out.  We'll be back in touch in a bit.  Rick's couple running around the base is the wrong way.  Last time someone got it in the can like that at Yankee Stadium, it was the New York Mets.  Easy. 
[01:21:00]  Come on.  What?  Oh, Antonio, what's the deal, man?  What the ass?  Yo.  What the ass?  What the ass?  Earl's laughing.  What the ass, man?  Yo, man.  Come on.  Come on.  Chill, yo.  Yo.  Come on.  That's funny.  Wow.  That brings them to 87 points, the two-point conversion.  Boom.  Jamie's first one.  A lot of people going on as we check in with the Hungarian Humpers at Stephen Lynch's team.  Yes.  Hungarian Humpers.  We just, uh, goddammit, we got out of Tomb Raider.  Okay.  With a two-point conversion. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  Wow.  All right.  And we're on our way to the Intrepid, but on the way we found a New York City library.  Two-point conversion.  Wait, so you did the library and a movie?  Yeah, both two-point conversion.  Oh, my God.  Now, we're headed, we're right near 40.  We're heading toward the Intrepid.  We should be there momentarily.  Can we, can we get a score?  How we doing?  Uh-uh.  What do we need to do?  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  You got to keep going, my brother.  Let's just put it this way.  You guys got to work a little harder.  Are you serious?  But you're in there. 
[01:22:00]  You're in there.  You're in there.  Okay.  Hey, Lindsay, what happened to your old-fashioned reporter voice?  We're loving that today.  I'll bring him back, but I was getting kind of harried.  All right.  I got, we got chased out of the hotel, so.  All right.  There goes.  All right, I'll check in later.  There goes Stephen Lynch and the Hungarian humpers, Anthony.  And we got to go right to Voss' team, the AK-47s.  Hey.  Here they are.  Voss.  Hey.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, Ben.  Ben's back in the studio.  Hold on.  Voss, go ahead. 
[01:22:30]  We just did Fridays on Broadway.  That's a theme restaurant, right?  That is indeed a theme restaurant.  Yes.  Hey, you know what?  This is really taking a lot out of me.  This is wearing me out.  We haven't even gotten a cab yet.  We've been doing everything on foot.  Okay?  We'll get, yeah.  We're headed to Times Square.  All right?  Then I think we're going to probably hit Empire Sheppoly in the library.  All right.  We're trying to save you money.  We haven't used a cab yet.  Hey, thank you, Voss.  Don't have a heart attack.  Voss is a heavy smoker.  I know.  We should have taken that into consideration.  He's probably having a tough time keeping up with his couple there, Ant. 
[01:23:00]  I'm so out of breath.  I'm running around.  I'm sweating.  But I'll tell you, these guys are doing great.  And I might have their open for me.  You're sweating worse than the audience at a Jeff Norris show.  Don't talk about Jeff Norris that way.  All right.  Thank you, Voss.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  There goes the AK-47s.  Stinky checking in once again with Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Stinky.  Hey.  Hey, Stinky.  Where are you? 
[01:23:30]  Maybe they need to talk about breakfast.  You're crapping out, Stinky.  Yeah, your phone is breaking up, Stinky.  Wait.  Stinky, where are you?  We're at the place where they made a movie about eating breakfast.  Okay.  They're at a place.  Breakfast at wherever.  Breakfast at wherever.  And what happens, Stinky?  They're in the bathroom.  They're both in the store.  The guys keep walking in.  And you can see both of their legs in the store.  Oh, my God.  You should have gotten the garbage bag. 
[01:24:00]  They come walking in.  It was a great...  They're like, what's the noise?  And I just kept, like, trying to block whatever view I could of anything.  So did they get it?  Two-point conversion.  Two-point conversion?  Stinky.  That's a very dangerous location.  Get out of there.  We had a lot of problems with that.  Yes.  That is one they really don't take lightly, this type of activity in their store.  All right.  Stinky.  We'll check in with you in a little bit, all right?  Opie, that is a big money location. 
[01:24:30]  That's 20 points with the two-point conversion, 22 points.  This is unbelievable.  They're just on the verge of cracking the 200-point mark at 177 points.  Wow.  Running away with the competition at this point.  I'm sure he's going to buy her an engagement ring before he leaves.  Ben's in the studio with his...  What's going on here?  Somebody's getting fluffed.  Oh, the fluff is going on?  Yeah, getting a little fluffy.  A little fluff action.  We're going to hit the celebrity points with Jim in here, so we ran back here from Times Square. 
[01:25:00]  We're going to get the 30 points.  Yes, son.  Do it, son.  Yeah.  There's something going on back there, I see.  Yeah.  I see they're poised in front of the world's largest rock and roll library, as it used  to be called before it was pilfered.  And I don't see her.  I see his back.  Yeah, yeah.  And I see her knees.  I see her shoulders.  And they're a little low.  I see her elbows.  Yeah, the same level of his knees.  He's going on. 
[01:25:30]  Boy, has it taken this long to get prepared at other locations?  It's been hard for him at a couple spots.  We actually, just on the way back, had to hit a cab to do this, even though we'd already  been in a cab, to get him ready for...  Right.  ...in front of Jim.  And the cab driver totally knew what was going on.  He's adjusting his mirror.  It's pretty hilarious.  Yo, dude, I got the E if you need it, son.  Almost ready.  They're almost ready to go?  Okay.  Let me check in with one of the teen perverts following Stinky's team. 
[01:26:00]  Alex.  Hey.  Oh, man.  What's going on?  Hey.  What's happening, man?  Hey.  They have an amazing strategy.  I must say, they have not used a cab yet, and they're just, they're running everywhere.  It's hard for us to keep up.  Is it?  Yeah.  And they're perverts, kid.  It's not hard for him, though, obviously.  He's going at it.  They're on fire, the Pebbles and Bam Bam.  They're running away.  I brought a Pentax just in case, but I think they're all right.  All right.  Thank you, Alex.  All right.  Take it easy.  All right.  Bye.  Wow.  I really had my money early on the Hungarian Humpers, Lynch's team. 
[01:26:30]  They seemed to have everything going for them, which just goes to show you, you really  can't tell who's going to emerge victorious until the competition starts.  It might look good on paper.  The stats might be there.  Right.  We have the European girl.  She's from Hungary.  They have the Viagra.  They have the lubricants.  This girl's ready to go.  She was eager for the two-point conversion.  I had this team winning, Opie.  They've only had one two-point conversion.  Yeah.  As we enter this competition, enter, we look at Pebbles and Bam Bam now, running away 
[01:27:00]  with this thing.  So who's in second and third place?  Second place right now is Voss's team.  All right.  The AK-47s?  Yes.  They have the 95 points.  And I'm assuming Lynch, the Hungarian Humpers, third place.  No.  Rick's team, the two-point conversion that just happened.  If you remember, it was Jamie's first two-point conversion, brought their total one point  above Lynch's.  So important, these two-point conversions.  There you go.  All right.  Sean, what's going on? 
[01:27:30]  Yo.  What's up, Sean?  I'm calling from Philly.  I cannot believe what I'm hearing.  This is Sex for Sam 2, my brother.  I'm sitting here.  You guys got to bring that down here.  This is incredible.  People are banging around Manhattan.  Yes.  All right.  We got to let you go because Stinky's team is checking in once again.  Oh, my God.  Number one in Philly.  All right.  These two don't stop.  Let's go back to Stinky's team.  Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Stinky.  Hey, guys.  We ran away from the danger zone right next door to the Trump Tower.  We found a little emergency exit area. 
[01:28:00]  And they're going to see smiling.  He's pointed.  They're really putting on the show.  They're putting on a show.  It's almost like doing the victory dance when you make the touchdown.  This is a mockery almost.  Unbelievable.  That good for 15 points and then the two-point conversion.  What?  Yeah.  17 points.  He just zipped up, so we're moving on.  All right.  I can't say that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  They just dumped out.  Why?  What's on the carpet?  There's something going on in that. 
[01:28:30]  Well, maybe it was something else.  Well, Ben's back in the studio.  What happened to your couple?  Ben, what happened to him?  They ran out of the studio.  No, they need to get prepared for Jim.  And they were just, he was hearing stuff in here and was freaking out a little bit.  So I put him in the J-More suite.  Well, sorry.  We're putting on a show.  So you moved your couple so they could come.  They're going to go in the J-More suite for a couple minutes.  I turned off the monitor and then they're coming back in here.  You're wasting valuable time, my friend.  Well, this is 30 points.  Yes, this is a big money thing.  But you know something?  You are wasting time because the good strategy would be to come back at the end and then do it. 
[01:29:00]  And then you would have the time that you would be out there doing other locations.  Let's check in with Jody.  Jody!  Is that me?  Yeah.  It's Tony, actually.  Tony.  What's up, Tony?  What's up, guys?  You guys are gods, man.  I swear to God.  Howard Stern, he's just an illusionist.  You guys, I've got to open up a church, Opie and Anthony, somewhere.  Thank you, Tony.  Unbelievable.  Keep it up, man.  You make me ask myself every day.  Keep it up.  And that's what we're saying to our competitors out there. 
[01:29:30]  They've got to keep it up if they want to wish sex for Sam, my brother.  Guys, just keep it up.  Keep up the great work.  Keep up what you're doing.  Just keep it up.  That's all I've got to say as a little inspiration to the competitors out there.  Very brave.  All right.  Ben is talking to his couple outside the bathroom.  Well, that's what a good coach should do, Opie.  He's got to get his hands in there and get dirty himself sometimes.  Ben's coming back in.  Ben?  They're uncomfortable.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they're uncomfortable here. 
[01:30:00]  Ben, your team again this year.  Now, although much better than last year's team, still a little disappointed.  We're just a little uncomfortable in here.  A little uncomfortable in here.  Ben's team falling apart right in front of his eyes.  I'm not used to being naked in front of other people.  You know what I think?  I think you ought to take it back out on the road.  Come back and try this again later on after some icy cold Sam.  Yeah, why don't you take a fine summer ale with you and we'll see what happens, okay?  Sounds good.  Ben getting distraught.  Hey, at least we're on the board. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, look.  Hey, at least we're on the board this year.  You know, this is, you know.  All right.  Now, Voss called in earlier and said he hasn't spent any money on the cab or anything lately,  and I think Young Buck on the National Line 4 has something to say about that.  Young Buck.  Let's go to Young Buck.  What's up, Buck?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, like if anything new, the Jew's trying to save money.  Voss hasn't spent a penny.  We gave our competitors money to get around the city, get into movies, a little pocket  change for what they might need to score some points. 
[01:31:00]  Voss hasn't spent a dime on his team.  Nikki.  Nikki.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  How are you doing?  Let's go.  Huh?  You're on the radio.  Let's go.  Okay.  I just wanted to say that you guys are really great.  Oh.  Oh, well, there you go.  And this contest is awesome.  I never heard anything like this before.  You like it?  Thank you, Nikki.  It's great.  You're from Philly?  I'm from Reading, actually.  And now we're from Philly.  Pennsylvania, kid.  Yeah, that's one.  Sex for Sam, coming to Philly.  Great.  I got to say it.  All right. 
[01:31:30]  Thank you.  All right.  We'll do that.  Bye.  Anthony, we should take a break.  We will break into commercials because the competition is heating up.  We only have an hour left in the competition.  Oh, my God.  Time is flying.  First place in the lead, of course, no surprise here, Stinky's team, Pebbles and Bam Bam, with  194 points, poised to break 200 points with the next conquest.  Nice.  Second place.  Wait.  Jim, on line one, Stinky's the Vince Lombardi of Sex for Sam.  Absolutely.  I got to know what kind of speeches he's giving his team because it's fantastic. 
[01:32:00]  He left here, dare I say, cocky that his team would win.  And I think he's right.  Rich Voss coming in second place.  His team, AK-47, with 95 points.  But Voss, he's running out of steam, man.  A one-point difference between third and fourth place.  Rick's team in third place, 87 points.  Lynch's team with 86 points.  Two-point conversion.  Very important.  And bringing up the rear, no pun intended, again, boy, all the puns. 
[01:32:30]  Team CAC, C-A-C, Simon and Jolene, Ben's team with 70 points.  Just falling apart in front of Ben.  Yeah.  Ben very depressed.  Yeah.  Two years in a row.  He grabbed two summer hails and broke out.  Y'all can't have this, don't worry.  Yo, but I would have had no problem railing that, honey.  She look kind of good, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  What are the rules?  Your last substitute? 
[01:33:00]  You know, on an injury, Ben should go to the bullpen.  Bring in the lefty.  Bring in the lefty.  You can't!  All right, it's Sex for Sam 2.  We got Jim Cook in the studio.  We will break into commercial as soon as these guys check in again, so stay there.  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You know, I just like want to throw up. 
[01:33:30]  Feel the love.  1027 WNEW announces our new fall lineup starting Monday.  Sports guys mornings.  Don and Mike, middays.  We'll be in Anthony afternoons.  Ron and Fez, nights.  Our new fall lineup starting Monday.  1027 WNEW.  Jim, you didn't hear that.  Anthony, Lifestyles condoms.  Lifestyles condoms, that's it.  We're talking about a little sex.  How do you make it better using a condom with Lifestyles condoms? 
[01:34:00]  Any of the couples using the Lifestyles condoms today?  No, I think they're in monogamous long-term relationships.  They're all going free.  They're all, okay.  Yeah, that's what it is.  No, I think they just don't like the smell of burning rubber.  Maybe that's it.  You do have to get through these locations quickly.  And you don't want to peel out, as they say.  Yeah.  Lifestyles condoms, discs.  It looks like a little butter pack you get in a diner.  You peel the lid back.  Easy to open, even in the dark.  No struggling.  They're facing right side up, so it's easy to use even in the dark.  You don't get all confused. 
[01:34:30]  They have the extra-sensitive discs.  They're a lot thinner than ordinary condoms for the added sensation.  Lifestyles discs, a variety of fun styles and flavors.  They got sensuous vanilla, very strawberry, and tropical abanana.  Check out lifestyles.com on the net and find out about Lifestyles condoms, discs.  Easy to open, easy to use condom.  Waiting for the couples to check back in.  As soon as they do, we'll break in.  Stay there.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, by O.P. and Anthony, all owned by Infinity Broadcasting. 
[01:35:00]  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  All right, we're back.  It's Sex for Sam 2, Anthony.  In the studio, Jim Cook.  We've got to go right to the phones because all the teams are checking in.  Yes.  Let's go with Ben.  Checking in with the CAC team and Ben.  Ben, what's up?  What's up, guys?  We're on the roof of our building, and what a surprise.  No problem whatsoever.  They're going right at it.  Oh, the roof, a mere 10 points, Ben.  I know, but they needed a place to get back the mood, so we're on the roof, and now we're 
[01:35:30]  moving on again.  Ben, let me tell you something.  If you would have been able to get the 30 points in a year earlier, it would have put  you in second place.  Really?  Yeah, that's how close this is.  You want to try for the 30 points again?  Yeah, they really needed to get back in the mood, but from the looks of things right now,  we might be able to come back down.  All right, let's see if you can make a comeback.  All right.  Thank you, Ben.  Hi.  There goes Ben and the CAC team.  Yes.  It's Rich Voss and the AK-47s.  Rich? 
[01:36:00]  My team has no conscience.  We stood under the WOW board in Times Square, right?  Yeah.  Two-legged.  I paid a homeless guy $5.  Yeah.  And in front of us in Block and Watch, we stood there, and they did it, right?  So we go to the homeless guy.  We got to get out of here.  He goes, can I come along?  He wanted to join us, right?  So we got the WOW sign.  We got Times Square and a homeless guy all in one.  Oh.  Now, they hadn't had Times Square yet, right? 
[01:36:30]  No.  It was packed.  It was packed.  One lady, another one walked by and discussed, do we have to get a receipt from the homeless  guy for $5 that we put out?  You juke.  What's wrong with you, man?  Under the three-story WOW billboard in Times Square, Anthony, and in front of the homeless  person and Times Square itself, that's a huge combination right there.  That is really big.  That's 45 points total right there.  Wow.  Wow. 
[01:37:00]  And you know what?  Huh?  Listen to me.  I'm not lying.  We have not gotten a cab yet.  We have been walking everywhere in like a big circle.  Yeah.  You know what?  This is all mapped out perfect.  This is unbelievable.  Voss has now broken.  His team has now broken the 100-point mark with 140 points right now.  That was such a big score.  That was such a big score.  That was a power move, my friend.  Power move.  That was a definite power move.  One of the firemen said we can go to their firehouse if we want to.  Well, that isn't a location.  We should have made it a location.  We're stupid today. 
[01:37:30]  All right, boss.  All right.  There go the AK-47s.  We've got to check in with Stinky.  Second place.  The two-point conversion team of Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Oh, yeah.  We just left the MoMA Museum bookstore where they did it in the elevator.  Now we're in the New York Public Library in the stairwell.  It's like a golf tournament.  So you got...  Yeah.  Stinky, you got a museum?  Yes.  And a library.  Right across the street from the museum to the library. 
[01:38:00]  And hit the...  Come on.  Let's keep...  Like, I'll clap.  All right.  We're headed now to the library now.  Stinky, I have to ask.  Was it two-point conversion each time?  Oh, yeah.  It's obvious.  Okay.  We even have to ask at this point.  Yes.  You know something?  I know it gets monotonous, but yes, we do have to ask.  It was a museum.  It was the war.  It was a golf tournament.  That's the best.  Stinky's team in the middle of the library.  He has a tight lie.  140 yards to the hole.  He's going to use a six iron.  He approaches the hole.  All right, Stinky. 
[01:38:30]  Thank you.  We're right now.  This puts Pebbles and Bam Bam above the 200-point mark.  Stinky's team, Pebbles and Bam Bam now at 223 points.  Racking up points left and right here.  It's amazing.  Anthony, I should point out, though, Voss' team making a comeback.  That was a power move.  Yeah.  Making a comeback with that whole Times Square move.  Yeah, that was a power move.  45 points and one...  Triple one.  One whatever you want.  Very big. 
[01:39:00]  Very big.  Jim Cook from Sam Adams in the studio.  We're doing this for him, my friend.  Jim, this is all for you.  You've inspired us to do this.  Yes.  The winner will get the trip to Boston to see the Foo Fighters and party at the brewery  for like, I don't know, I think you guys party there for a week straight.  Yeah, three days.  Anthony, why don't we tell everyone what's going on for the last time?  We only have 47 minutes left in the competition.  This is Sex for Sam 2.  We have a list and we have five couples. 
[01:39:30]  They have to go to the locations on our list.  And each location has a point value.  They then have to, well, have sex at these locations for the point value each location has.  If the guy spins the girl around at the location, uses the balloon nut, an additional two points.  The two-point conversion.  This is Sex for Sam 2.  2? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys, I just got off, out of lunch with my parents over at Friday's.  Friday's?  Yeah, my dad looks over and he says, Jesus Christ, what the hell is that?  Two people going at it.  Yes, TGI Friday's, I believe Voss had sex with his couple.  Well, his couple had sex at TGI Friday's.  Voss wants to join his couple today.  Yes, they did have sex in Friday's, so the guy wasn't seeing things. 
[01:40:30]  All right, where do we go now?  People looking at that and not the employee's flair on their suspenders?  Maybe the couple put a little new flair on their suspender.  Malik, what's going on?  How you doing, fellas?  All right, you got to make it fast because I think one of the couples is checking in.  Yeah, no doubt.  I want to first say, you know, I want to give a shout out to ODB, hold me down.  My man, my man, Malik, I heard you yesterday, God.  Yeah, no doubt.  Real, son.  You're running out of time.  Let's just check in.  There was no doubt that Stinky was going to win from the beginning because he was working 
[01:41:00]  with her brother, and you know how we do.  This isn't over.  All right, thank you.  There goes Malik.  We got to check in with Lynch and the Hungarian Humpers.  Lynch!  The Hungarian Humpers are doing fine.  I hear we're way behind, but that's all right.  We got a few to report here.  Okay.  We got the Intrepid just in the nick of time.  Wow.  The Intrepid.  They just closed.  Okay.  We thought it was a mistake coming all the way over here to the west side.  Oh, all right.  We got a two-point conversion.  How are you guys doing, Hungarian Humpers?  Yes, they are up against the bus.  That's ten points.  The bus has a wow sign on it. 
[01:41:30]  That's another 20 points.  God damn it.  Oh, my God.  That's a huge combination.  And now we are three minutes away from a Hanson cab.  You can hear the horses.  We're running towards it now.  We're going to catch up, God damn it.  We'll check in later.  All right.  There goes Lynch's team.  You know something?  That put Lynch's team, the Hungarian Humpers, above the 100-point mark with 123 points right now.  What a close race for second place right now. 
[01:42:00]  It's going to take a real strong effort to beat Pebbles and Bam Bam.  But it can be done.  They might peter out, if I may use the term peter.  Peter out before this is over.  And if Voss' team makes some power moves like they just did, and Lynch's team, the Hungarian Humpers,  makes some power moves and get those quick big points in one sitting, standing, stepping, whatever you want to call it,  it's still anyone's game.  Jack, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:42:30]  What's the total number of points they could actually max the thing out at?  Oh, my God.  That's a good question.  Probably 400 or 500 points.  Yeah, there's hundreds.  We have so many different locations and combos.  We'll have to add it up one of these days.  Yeah, and with the two-point conversion, you know.  Yeah.  Huge.  I think we'll do that at the winter meetings.  Yeah.  When we discuss the location of the next one.  Will cities have to bid like the Olympics?  You know what I'm saying?  Have to bid on it and then win.  It'll be this big hoopla. 
[01:43:00]  You know, Philadelphia has won the right for Sex and Sex and Sex next year.  Oh, my God.  We're so happy.  It's going to bring such money into our economy.  Hey, Jeff.  What's going down, man?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I was wondering if you could put the list up on the web so I could practice for next year.  Oh, look at that.  Someone's getting ready for next year.  I think after we're done, yeah, we could put the list up on the site.  You could check out the sites.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right, Jeff.  See you. 
[01:43:30]  You know what's weird?  Rick's couple.  Again.  Not checking in often, but he's got some power moves inside of him.  Come with me with the 30 points.  The whole Yankee Stadium thing was huge.  Yankee Stadium.  It's going to take him a little while to get back from there.  It took him a while to get there, but it was for 32 points because he got the conversion.  I think, but at this point, time becomes a factor.  Yes, it does, old Dirty.  Very good.  Yes.  He has 87 points.  He has not broken the 100-point barrier yet.  When these other teams are just going around locally, ringing up a lot of points. 
[01:44:00]  Could hurt them.  And Ben's team, 80 points.  They are in last place.  Ben's team, falling apart in front of his eyes.  Yeah.  Very sad.  Boston Red Sox, they were in first place, right, Jim?  I was thinking more like the Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl myself.  We're a little touchy about that.  We just had a bad century.  Hey, Tim, what's going on?  How are we doing?  I wanted to know, how come Jim ain't jumping on the mic? 
[01:44:30]  I haven't heard too much from him yet.  I'd say it's not taking calls from us.  Todd, if that isn't your next commercial.  That should be your next commercial.  He might have jumped out of that, but that's damn funny.  That's very funny, Jim.  All right.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Jim, you enjoying Sex for Sam 2 this year?  You know, Rick said it was going to be raunchier than last year, and I was, like, trying to imagine what could...  Is this going to be farm animals?  Is this going to be...  Hey! 
[01:45:00]  Oh, Jim!  Thank you so much!  I see Sex for Sam 3!  Every year, it's got to go to that next level.  Yeah.  I like it.  I like it a lot.  Farm animals.  Look at him grabbing a beer real fast.  Oh, no.  What did I do now?  Imagine the chicken conversion, right?  I think that'd be worth, like, 50 points.  Oh, hell yeah!  100 for the rooster.  Still plenty of locations available. 
[01:45:30]  Of course, you know the rules.  You can't do the same location twice.  Right.  But there are still plenty of locations.  I wonder why no one's head downtown to go.  If I can mention, I don't think anyone will get kicked out of there.  Paisano Mulberry Street is on the list.  Yes, it is, Anthony.  I have a feeling...  Ask for Joey.  Bang in front of him.  You get 20 points.  I have a feeling...  And Joey's a celebrity.  Joey's a celebrity.  Uh-oh.  I don't think people were thinking that way, Anthony.  I think that's a 50 score right there.  That's a huge combination right there.  Yeah. 
[01:46:00]  Wow.  I'm looking at some of these point values,  and I'm wondering why a lot of the couple's not going for some of the 20 and 30 point locations,  sticking with the 10s and 15s.  But we have a lot of the couple staying local, except maybe for Rick's couple.  I have a feeling Rick's couple is heading down to Paisano's.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, farm animals?  That's really bad.  Oh, that old gag was bad.  Oh, Uncle John. 
[01:46:30]  There's one very risky location on here that's worth 30 points.  I wonder who's got the balls for that one.  Which one is it, Anthony?  It's probably the one that just gets you arrested.  It's on page two.  Page two.  Midway down, 30 points.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there's another one, 30 points, that you might get you killed getting there.  Yeah.  I'm surprised.  You know something?  Maybe that's where Rick might be.  If he was going to Yankee Stadium, he might just head over and try this location. 
[01:47:00]  He's definitely going there.  That's another 30-pointer.  He's definitely going there.  Who's checking in right now?  They won't put him on hold.  It looks like it's Voss' AK-47 team, but just put him on hold.  I know.  Thank you.  Yeah, there it is, Voss.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's check in with Voss and the AK-47s.  Voss.  Hey, can I say what we just did this?  Yeah.  We're standing beside Penn Station, right?  Yeah, yeah.  In front of a hot dog guy.  Yeah.  And we did it inside a PLJ van. 
[01:47:30]  Wait.  I swear to God, the guy's here right now from PLJ.  We had him open a van, and they did it in front of Penn Station at Madison Square Garden.  What?  I swear to God.  Giving PLJ the high, hard one.  Is the van driver there?  Is the van driver right here?  You want to speak to him?  Yeah.  Here, here.  Say hi to there.  Say your name.  Hello?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  What are you doing, man?  What are you doing?  You let one of the couples have sex in the PLJ van?  In the driver's seat with the door open.  Oh, you rock.  Oh, my God. 
[01:48:00]  There's not a line.  Stay in front of my at Madison Square Garden.  You rock.  Whenever you want to work for us, let us know.  Hot dog guys are about five feet away.  Cool.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  We hope to go as far as hot dog.  Thank you, bro.  No problem.  All right.  Where is Madison Square Garden on this?  I think there's...  Hello?  Yeah.  Voss, is there a Penn Station location?  We're trying to figure out what you just did here.  Well, yeah.  It says Madison Square Garden, right?  Madison Square Garden is at Penn Station.  We're standing right outside where it says Felix Trinidad and Bernard Hopkins.  It's a big fight. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  I'm looking at the list.  I don't see Madison Square Garden or Penn Station.  No.  Where is it?  Is it here?  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  It's there.  Between movie theater and ATM.  Oh, okay.  MSG.  MSG.  We got it.  Okay.  All right, so you had sex at MSG in front of a hot dog guy.  In another radio station's van.  Unfortunately, that's not a point value.  No. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, come on.  We just crashed your van and now we're out of here.  I love it, man.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  Thank you, boss.  Bye.  Let's check in with Stinky.  Yeah.  With Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Stinky.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  We are in Rockefeller Center in NBC Studios, and they're on a stairwell, and people walk  it up right now, so I'm trying to avoid them.  Is Bam Bam doing to Pebbles what NBC did to me and Opie? 
[01:49:30]  Not yet.  He's getting fluffed right now.  Right on the steps.  Right on the steps.  Two maintenance guys just walked past.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Stinky, what's the nearest poster on the wall?  They have a lot of posters, you know, like an SNL poster.  I don't know.  We're on the mezzanine.  I mean, it's pretty vacant up here.  It's a big, empty hallway.  This Tishman Spires property.  Tishman.  Yo, they're big, kid.  Those people ain't no jokes, son. 
[01:50:00]  Even old Dirty knows who Tishman is.  Tishman ain't no jokes.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  And, Stinky, are they getting the job done now?  Not yet.  They're almost ready.  I mean...  All right.  Let me check in with Rick.  I'm going to keep you on hold, though.  Stay there.  Very risky.  All right.  Let's go to Rick and his team, the C-blockers.  All right, guys.  I know we've been out of touch for a little bit, but the subway, I think, may have cost us  some crucial time.  But we are back in Central Park.  Look, I've got my guys up on one of the rocks near a sleeping guy.  Unfortunately, he doesn't look homeless.  He's got a newspaper. 
[01:50:30]  Oh.  But I do have confirmation of entrance, and we are now going to exit the park.  So count us for Central Park.  But unfortunately, we couldn't find any homeless guys at all.  Rick, a lot of people thought you were going up to Clinton's office.  Yep.  I was going to attempt that, but I couldn't rely on the subway service, as you can tell,  because it took us so long to be at the Yankee Stadium.  I think it may have crimped our odds, so to speak.  But we're going to try and make up time now.  The game is afoot, and we are back in the park.  All right.  All right.  Greg, and the C-blockers. 
[01:51:00]  Back to Stinky at NBC.  That was a mistake going all the way up to Yankee Stadium, Anthony.  Well, I believe I'm going to go into my office.  Sam broke on NBC Nightly News.  Hey, what are we...  Oh, my goodness.  I believe he's fluffing her.  Stinky, what's going on?  They have to do it.  Some guy came.  He was a pervert.  Uh-oh.  You're breaking up, Stinky.  He was away, so quickly...  Stinky. 
[01:51:30]  Rockefeller and NBC Studios.  Wait, wait.  You got...  Repeat that, Stinky.  You broke up, okay?  Oh, I got NBC Studios and Rockefeller.  Well, it says NBC Today Show.  Oh, whatever.  Well, then we got Rockefeller.  All right.  And the two-point.  Yeah, I feel way ahead anyway, so...  All right, Stinky.  Oh, look at the confidence, right?  Continues to be cocky.  Yes.  Very cocky.  All right, Stinky.  See you guys.  All right.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[01:52:00]  Top story this evening.  What I saw in the hallway.  Unbelievable.  It looked like a black man having a backdoor action with a Hispanic woman.  I have not seen this.  And let me tell you something.  It looked a lot like when Katie Couric got her colonoscopy on the Today Show. 
[01:52:30]  Only the black eye was bigger.  All right, Ed.  We should take a break, but we'll break in if the couples call in.  It's Sex for Sam 2 in the studio.  Jim Cook.  We got old dirty.  Yeah, yeah.  I hear outside the studio is Michael Winslow.  Word up from Police Academy, kid.  All right, the sound effect guy from Police Academy.  Yes.  There we go. 
[01:53:00]  And also getting a report that Stephen Lynch is upstairs.  I think he's making his way down to the studio.  We'll be right back.  Opie.  I'm the dick.  Anthony.  I'm an ass.  Why are you wasting your time with this sleazy trash?  People are starting to say funniest radio ever, so don't wreck it.  Stop by Strauss today for big savings on hundreds of items.

Anthony, pinnacle-horned, don't we?  But there's so much action going on.  We've got to check in with some of the teams really fast.  Rick and the C-Blockers, what's going on?  Yeah, guys, we just scored a major coup.  I got one of the handsome carriage rides, the horse-thrawn carriage.  Yes.  We were coming out of the park.  The guy was kind enough not to take us on a full ride. 
[01:54:00]  He's letting them sit in it for five minutes.  And, wow, got some people watching us, too.  Really?  Confirmation, full confirmation, handsome carriage ride.  And a group of people watching.  What are you guys watching here?  Huh?  Oh, just a couple of...  I mean, thanks.  Well, there you have it.  Well, another confirmation.  With a handsome carriage, we are back in the game.  All right, Rick and the C-Blockers.  Thank you.  There they go, Anthony.  And let's check in with Ben and the CAC team. 
[01:54:30]  Ben!  What's happening, guys?  How are you feeling, Ben?  Well...  You ready to rally?  No.  We went to the roof, and we were on the roof.  And before I knew it, everything was over for them as far as the end was reached.  Wait a minute.  He finished?  Yeah.  Oh, no!  He started going crazy.  I was like...  Oh, no!  And then again, there's nothing I can do.  There's nothing I can do.  So...  Now we... 
[01:55:00]  Ben, I hope there's nothing you can do.  I hope...  Oh, no!  Ben disappointed two years in a row.  His team limping to the finish.  Once again, we're ending our day in a bar.  Ben's going to a bar.  Did I tell you that?  Ben's team dribbling to the finish.  They had a good time.  Get a grip, man.  You're freaking me out.  Oh, Ben.  Poor Ben.  Once again.  Jolene really loves the roof.  This is horrible news.  Jolene is definitely the highlight of the day. 
[01:55:30]  Can I...  We talked to...  What's his name?  I recommend everyone go to the roof.  Where's Simon?  Let's talk to Simon.  Simon.  Okay, here's Simon.  Hello, gentlemen.  Simon, why couldn't you hold out?  Hold out.  Dude, that roof was awesome, man.  Stupid.  Yeah, you couldn't hold out to finish the game.  You had to finish the job.  Hold on, Anthony.  We've got to interrupt.  There's some hardcore action going on in the hallway.  You've got to bring him over here, man. 
[01:56:00]  You've got to get in here.  Come on.  It's got to be in front of...  It's not in front of the celebrity.  Stephen Lynch's team in the studio.  The Hungarian...  And the major disappointment as the Hindenburg...  What happened?  What happened?  You're going to try it again?  Oh, we have to do it again?  Yeah.  What happened?  You've got to see it.  It wasn't in front of...  You can do it.  All right.  They're going to try to prepare again.  Ben, back to you and the CAC team.  Yeah, we're back here at the bar drinking, threatening our sorrows once again this year. 
[01:56:30]  Ben, you finished up with 80 points.  Actually, did they finish on the rooftop?  Yeah, it was pretty crazy.  I was like, you know, we want to finish.  And there was no stopping them.  Yeah.  Well, sometimes that happens.  And you've got to say, hey, sorry.  Hey, at least my team got on the board this year.  So I'm not that upset.  Ben, you finish up your team, the CAC team, CAC, Simone and Jolene, with...  Simon and Jolene, with 90 points. 
[01:57:00]  All right, Ben.  Thank you.  Ben, I feel bad.  Ben's team is out of the competition.  We've got our first casualty of the day.  Ben's team, the agony of defeat.  Yeah.  Once again, man.  Poor Ben.  Always ends up in the bar drinking because his team either couldn't get started or that  one finished a little too soon.  All right.  Anthony, pinnacle horny go, Wade.  Oh, my God.

[01:58:30]  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  All right.  We're back.  It's Sex for Sam 2 with Opie and Anthony.  Jim Cook, Old Dirty, and everyone having sex all over Manhattan today.  Lots have happened since we took a break here.  Lynch's couple finally had sex in front of everybody, the Hungarian humpers, and they  are back on the streets of New York.  While that was going on, Michael Winslow was waiting to come into the studio, the guy from 
[01:59:00]  Police Academy, you know, the sound effects comedian.  Yeah.  He saw the couple having sex.  He was horrified.  And no joke, he ran out of here.  Wait a minute.  Is he gone?  Gone.  He ran.  Not even a goodbye.  Like, he got really freaked out.  I was just talking to Greg from Caroline's.  He goes, well, he's kind of a nerdy type guy, and he was really freaked out.  He ran out of here?  Without saying goodbye or anything.  I mean, he just bolted.  That is so funny.  Because it was really funny.  The couple was in the bathroom. 
[01:59:30]  They were, can we say connected?  Sure.  They were connected, and then decided to run the whole mess into the studio.  Into the studio to show everybody.  And they had a run by Michael Winslow, and that's when he was horrified, no joke, and  ran out of here.  He'd never seen a four-legged beast.  Yeah, really?  That's what it looked like.  The door flew open, and all you see is hurt, like, on all fours, and he was behind a push  and trying to push into the studio.  It looked like it was a wheelbarrow race going on.  Michael Winslow laughed.  We horrified him. 
[02:00:00]  That's great.  What were they saying on the instant feedback?  Oh, they're loving life.  Oh, you ooze, you lose, as far as Ben's team goes.  Ben's team.  Ben's team.  The guy finished the job, and he's out, because the recharge period's just going to take too  long.  Why not?  A lot of the teams checking back in.  Opie, I'm reminded of great athletes.  Yeah.  Bruce Jenner, Nadia Komani.  Sure.  And now Rick's team checking in.  Right now.  The C-blockers.  The C-blockers.  Rob and Jamie.  Rick, where are you? 
[02:00:30]  Rick?  Cheating Rick.  Did we lose Rick?  All right.  We'll go to Stephen Lynch's team and see what's going on with Rick's life.  The Hungarian humpers, once again.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm being very quiet now, because, as you know, Carnegie Hall is closed.  Yes.  But for the, through September or something.  But the guy at the door was nice enough to let us get in the elevator and go to the  second floor.  And they have just done the act with a two-point conversion, and we are heading downstairs.  No!  That's 22 points. 
[02:01:00]  All right, Lynch.  Thank you.  Wow.  All right.  Goodbye.  All right.  Lynch, you know, he doesn't want to lose this thing.  Fred, what's going on?  Yo, boys, did Winslow do a speeding away sound effect by screeching as he left?  Oh, and he cut out the door.  I think we had a mic on, and we have what Michael Winslow said when he ran out of here because  he saw the people in.  Oh, that's his voice?  Yeah.  Is that really? 
[02:01:30]  Wow, he is good.  Wow.  He even shifted.  Wow, he should have stayed.  We freaked him out.  He didn't even shake anybody's hand.  He did nothing.  He just ran.  Hey, Michael, how fast did you leave the studio?  Oh, like a bullet.  That's good.  How did you do that with your mouth?  It's amazing.  Oh, my God.  We're bad, yo.  What guy just thinks he's coming into another radio show?  If you didn't see his face, yo, the look on his face is just wild. 
[02:02:00]  You do enough radio shows, you just figure you're going to walk in.  At least this show keeps people on their toes.  Yes, it does.  Because you're just going to walk in.  You're going to sit and wait.  They're going to call you in.  You're going to plug your gig.  You're going to leave.  This show, you sit down.  Oh, my God, what just came out of the bathroom?  And you have to flee the show.  He fled.  He fled.  He fled the show.  He didn't leave.  He fled.  He didn't say goodbye to anyone.  He just took off.  My man looks straight up.  All right.  We got to check back in with Rick.  We have 15 minutes left in Sex for Sam 2, Anthony. 
[02:02:30]  Rick and the C-Blockers, what's up?  Yeah, the C-Blockers are doing, while we were in spots, we hit FAO Schwartz.  All right.  It's tough to do, but we got it in.  Okay.  And then we just came out of a department store, the Nike store.  Yeah.  So I count that as a department store for 10 points.  All right.  All right.  We're going to throw Tiffany's next.  How much time do we have on the clock?  15 minutes left, Rick.  15 minutes.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  And we got to go right to Voss's team, the AK-47s. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Voss.  Just did three more plays.  We did an ATM, right?  Yeah.  As we're coming out of the ATM, there's a guy there with a headphone and a radio going,  Hey, Voss, you got to hurry up and catch up.  You're behind.  So then we did the ATM.  Then we went to the Empire State Building in the elevator there.  Okay.  And then we just got off a bus.  We rode the bus for 15 feet.  I go to the guy.  I go just, you know, take us a block.  You know, we're going on a block.  He goes, why?  Or whatever.  And then we did like 15 feet and we just walked off the bus. 
[02:03:30]  That's a lot of points.  Huh?  That's a lot of points piling up here.  We're on fire.  We're laying them all down because my crew is honest.  All right.  We got 15 minutes left in the competition, Voss.  I'm going to head over to Tiffany's, try to knock that place out, maybe buy something nice for the kids.  And here's where the competition goes bad.  She never announced Tiffany's.  Ouch.  That's a very dangerous location.  We barely got out of there alive last year. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  And Voss is announcing he's going to Tiffany's, Anthony.  That's horrible.  Don't announce it.  You idiot.  We're going to the precinct.  We're going to the 6th.  Right.  It's going to be great.  R.A.  Yeah.  Hey.  I got a question for you.  Okay.  This Bam Bam guy, I got to know what kind of dietary supplements he is on.  Is he on creatine or some damn thing?  I think he's on that Andros stuff, the McGuire juice.  Well, whatever you're on, we don't care.  Or is it just a hell of a lot of Sam Adams? 
[02:04:30]  All illicit drugs, paraphernalia, and anything that's unregulated is legal in this competition.  This game has no rules.  The Ogle has one rule.  You have to have done the act at one of these locations.  I think how you do it, we don't care.  That's right.  I think at the winter meetings, we're going to have to add more drugs to the list.  Stinky employed some teen kids that were running around one of the stores.  If I can correct you, they're teen pervs. 
[02:05:00]  Teen pervs, he said.  One running around with a penthouse, right?  Yeah.  And he kind of took them aboard to stand watch at some of the locations.  Brilliant on Stinky's part.  Where has Stinky been?  He hasn't checked in.  Maybe the team Pebbles and Bam Bam is slowing down a bit.  I hope he's not getting too cocky, Anthony.  He thinks he's got this thing won.  He and his team are very cocky at the beginning of this competition.  And they've made it pay off. 
[02:05:30]  They've done the job.  Jim Cook?  Jim Cook, you've been here throughout this entire Sex for Sam, which is dedicated to you, Jim Cook, and the fabulous beer, Sam Adams.  No doubt.  I'm so delighted.  Are you proud of us?  Well, I just didn't know what to expect when they said it was raunchy.  I was thinking maybe Hillary Clinton with a plumber's helper or something.  Oh, another great idea.  Write that down for Sex for Sam 3, Ed. 
[02:06:00]  Jim, you're coming up with good ideas for us.  Let's go to Rick and the C-Blockers as Jim pours into other Sam Adams.  Hey, guys.  It's Rick.  We are now in Trump Tower.  I've got a visual.  Let me ask him a quick question.  Are you going to the two?  Oh, yeah.  By the look on her face, it's the two-point conversion.  We've got Trump Tower.  Yeah, that's good, guys.  You can stop.  Let's get out of here.  It's a two-point conversion completed at Trump Towers, Anthony.  And, you know, you can always tell by the look on the girl's face if the two-pointer is going down. 
[02:06:30]  We saw it right here in the studio.  Remember the look on the girl's face?  Yeah.  The guy started, and we're like, is it the two-pointer?  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, yes.  It's the two-pointer.  The girls make a special face when it's the two-pointer.  She melted right into that one, Ed.  Right.  Yes.  Uh, let's check in with...  It almost looked like she started getting Bell's palsy.  Like the side of her face started drooping.  But she went in a good way.  In a good way, right?  That's what I'm saying. 
[02:07:00]  Uh, Stinky, what's going on?  Hey, uh, John, I guess Pebbles got...  Her feet got sore, so we had to stop and buy sneakers for her.  That was a delay.  Her feet?  That's what got sore?  They've been doing a two-point conversion at every location, and her feet got sore.  This woman is a dynamo.  She's a trampoline, dog.  What?  We're entering the Ziegfeld Theater right now.  The Ziegfeld?  And, uh, I guess they're going to see Planet of the Apes.  Oh, God.  Don't say that, Danito. 
[02:07:30]  No, I'm not saying...  Anything.  Anything.  Yeah.  Stinky, what kind of sneakers?  We stopped at Strawberry.  He got some, like, cheap hair or something.  I was thinking Nike, just do it.  Yeah, just do it.  They just sweet-talked away past...  They're going up another pair of steps.  I think they...  Stop it at the top of the steps.  Wait a minute.  At the Ziegfeld?  Yeah.  All the red velvets around. 
[02:08:00]  It's very sexy.  Setting.  Yes.  Very sexy.  Sexy.  She stopped off.  She was tired and a little sore.  She had to get some Preparation H in a diaper.  All right.  They're at the top of the steps, and they are in position.  The legendary Ziegfeld Theater.  This is great.  This place has been around for quite a while, and, uh...  How many times has this happened?  Oh, yeah.  So, they have...  They have caught...  They've completed...  They're coming down the steps now.  I was thinking it's in Planet of the Apes, right? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Well, actually, they didn't even get into the theater.  They just...  We talked to them.  All right.  I just wanted to ask if they have entered the Forbidden Zone once again.  Yes.  Again, the Forbidden Zone.  All right, Sting.  All right, guys.  See you.  There he goes.  What's in there?  Your destiny.  Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Let's check in with Stephen Lynch and the Hungarian Humpers.  And our tour concludes in Central Park, New York City, with another two-point conversion  amongst the lovely flora and fauna. 
[02:09:00]  Nice.  Yeah, I think we're done.  We're heading back in.  You're done.  All right.  All right, Lynch.  Yeah, we only got ten minutes left, and I think, unless we can find an ATM from here  to the studio, we're done.  That's it for us.  There's a couple in the area, Mr. Lynch.  Well, we're going to try to find one.  All right.  If not, then we'll see you in five minutes.  All right, good.  There goes Stephen Lynch and the Hungarian Humpers.  Wow.  That might be it for that team.  That's okay.  If they think they've scored enough, I'm not sure about that. 
[02:09:30]  I think maybe they should stay out there.  I don't think giving up right now is the thing to do.  And I think when you do finally give up, you should finish the job, for God's sake.  You know what I mean?  You're going to go home with some blue ones.  You know what I mean?  You know?  You don't want to get that feeling you did when you used to dry hump on the couch there  in junior high.  Huh?  You end up with a lap full of crazy glue and abdominal pains that don't go away for hours.  And mad burns, kid.  Right?  And the chafing on the zipper. 
[02:10:00]  But you know something?  It was the best time, right?  The best.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony, surprisingly, Team Six has not checked in at all yet today.  Team Six, surprisingly very quiet.  That would be Ken and Melissa.  Ken and Melissa haven't checked in yet for their points.  You're not on the list.  Wait a minute.  That would be the boss and the fine lady he's having the affair with.  Yo, man, you guys keep blowing up spots.  Guys, hi.  It's Ken Stevens.  I'm here with Melissa.  It's a wonderful time I'm having.  Are you doing the two-point conversion, Ken? 
[02:10:30]  All the time.  But she's doing it on me with a strap on.  That would be our...  That's how I like it.  Just the way O&A gave it to me.  That would be our boss that gave us the indication, Anthony.  We're so appreciative, aren't we?  Yes, we are.  Let's check in once again with Rick and the C-Blockers.  Hey, guys.  The C-Blockers, we just completed on a bus horrified about four businessmen who were standing there.  They all got up, walked away.  Unfortunately, Ken Stevens was eating up our time. 
[02:11:00]  We just jumped off the bus.  We're in Rockefeller Center.  How much time on the clock, please?  We got seven minutes left, Rick.  All right, thanks.  I'll be calling back.  All right, there he goes.  Rick and the C-Blockers.  I think the fight at this point is for second place.  Wouldn't you say, Jamaican might?  Well, we don't know that.  Well, it's very close.  Let me just say, it's very close, this competition.  Yeah.  Single-digit close or double-digit?  Well, one double-digit, though, will get you the win, I think.  It's pretty close.  There are some big money... 
[02:11:30]  This is getting hectic right now.  What's that, man?  What a great day for a sport today.  Yeah.  Wow, Ed has a comment about Penn's team.  Penn's team pathetic once again this year.  Yes, Ed.  Oh, my God.  Ed.  Oh, that's a good line.  Ed, are you there?  Ed.  Ed wanted to say, Ben should just be a fluffer next year.  Hey, be nice.  Ben had to once again hang out with his couple in a bar drinking because of problems. 
[02:12:00]  My man Ben got the curse of the Bambino, King.  There was one crucial turning point in this competition with Ben and his team.  When they came in here to get the 30 points to do it in front of a celebrity, Jim Cook,  it would have put them in second place at the time, which really, I think, would have rallied them because they were in last place.  It was that close.  They couldn't pull it off, couldn't perform, went up to the roof to get 10 points from the rooftop,  and the guy finished.  The guy.  So, pretty much takes you out of the game. 
[02:12:30]  Yes, Rick and the C-Blockers once again.  Hey, guys.  We're at Rockathaw Center, NBC's, the building.  We found a door that was ajar.  It's like an entrance closet.  Hold on.  What do we have?  Oh, my God.  We found a two-pointer record.  It sounded like a two-pointer record.  I think that was a two-pointer record.  Oh, my God.  She's staggering.  She's staggering.  It sure sounded like a two-pointer from here.  Oh, my God.  Either that or she was going for the... 
[02:13:00]  That's what it's like to be in prison, guys.  Either that or she stubbed her toe.  Or sometimes you make that sound when you're doing the...  I don't know.  You're doing the last...  The last set, right?  The last set.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  The last lift of the last set.  The last lift.  You kind of make that sound.  And Rick is gone.  Or you're getting it right in the balloon now.  One or the other.  That was classic.  Do we have... 
[02:13:30]  Do we...  Yes, I think we do.  Billy!  Ouch!  Voss, you know what?  Voss is going to get screwed.  I can't believe he announced he was going to Tiffany's and we haven't heard from him.  Yeah, that's a tough location.  That has always been a high-security location.  Yes.  All right, we have four minutes left in the competition.  Sex for Sam, too.  Jim, any comments?  I think this could be an Olympic event. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Couldn't it be?  Yeah.  And, Jim, this is all for you.  This is all about enjoying things, enjoying life.  Like your beer, Sam Adams.  How about that, huh?  Yeah, and you can take it orally.  There's no...  Right, see?  There's more.  Ah.  There's no sitting and having your chick get you ready to drink a Sam Adams.  No.  You can just, you pull it out, you pop it off, and it's in your mouth.  Nobody can blame.  Right.  Right.  It's always ready.  It's always wet. 
[02:14:30]  It tastes great.  All right.  And after your chick sucks on a Sam Adams bottle, you're not afraid to kiss her.  Right?  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  You get that taste of noble hops on your tongue.  Noble hops.  Noble hops.  Uh, no, not anyone.  Not sex for Sam.  Hello, who's that?  This is Dibs.  Who?  Dibs.  What's up, Dibs?  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah, Dibs.  You're wrecking our whole competition.  What are you doing?  I'm sorry. 
[02:15:00]  You guys got the...  You can get...  I'm sorry.  You guys got the...  No, you got the wrong number.  He was calling a crucial line that must remain open.  All right.  We have three minutes left in the competition.  Three minutes.  How many teams are going to score here right at the buzzer?  That's what we're waiting for.  Oh, I'm seeing a couple of teams checking in.  Uh-oh.  It's coming down to the wire.  All right.  Here goes Rick.  Rick and the C-blockers.  Rick making a huge effort here.  Rick.  Hey, guys.  We got turned away at Radio City, but I just paid a kid a buck or two to walk away so we 
[02:15:30]  could have a spot right next to the vendor.  And lift the skirt for me.  Thank you.  Hey, what do you think, sir?  I don't think you're nothing walking in.  All right.  We're good.  We're good.  Is it a conversion, Rick?  We're running.  You're running?  We're running.  All right.  No.  Was that the two-pointer?  Yeah, but it's me.  What did you say?  Hold on.  What did you say?  I said, yes, it was the two-point, but I got up so fast.  You can still...  I didn't hear, but it is two-point.  Yeah, that was a two-pointer, guys. 
[02:16:00]  How many minutes?  Just two minutes.  All right.  I got to find an ATM right across the street.  Let's go.  All right.  It looks like the hot dog made it into the bun, Anthony.  Yes.  We're not going to make it.  Lynche, Hungarian Humpers.  It's only two...  Hey, how much time do we have left?  In like two minutes.  Ah, damn it.  Why?  All right.  We just hit the Apple Bank on 53rd and 6th.  Yeah.  Did you rob it?  Right.  It's like, we just hit it, man.  I'm rich.  Yeah, but back to the contest.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  No, and they're running into the Museum of...  Or the...  What is this?  Museum of Modern Art, I guess.  All right.  It's a museum.  I don't know if they're going to make it, though.  How much time do we have left?  A minute and a half.  It's coming down to the...  Oh, my God.  It's packed in here.  Yeah, you get extra points for the war.  I'm going to put you on the line with Stinky, so hold on a second.  All right.  Stinky!  Pebbles and Bam Bam.  What's up?  All right.  Well, with the nice cab driver alarm here in a cab, we're right on 57th and 7th.  And they're almost trying. 
[02:17:00]  They're trying to get it going, but...  Oh, they're trying to hail a cab.  There it is right there.  Unfortunately, though, it's a black guy.  Oh, no.  There we go.  American Craft News.  Stinky!  Yo.  Are they having any luck getting the cab?  Do it.  I'll see if it counts.  Okay.  Okay.  They're still fluffing.  Oh, they're still fluffing?  Yeah.  Right in the middle of the street?  No, they're in the cab.  Oh, you're in the cab.  Okay.  All right.  I'm sorry.  You guys want to turn it to alarm?  American Craft News.  Uh, no, that's okay.  I think Lynch has a question.  Yeah.  Okay.  Lynch-y. 
[02:17:30]  30 seconds.  You got 30 seconds.  Does the American Craft Museum count?  It's a museum.  It's a museum.  It's right across from MoMA.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  It does?  Yeah.  It counts, guys.  Make it happen.  Make it freaking happen.  Are you in?  They're in.  They're in.  That's a winner.  I love it.  Everybody's looking forward.  All right.  We're coming back in.  All right.  There they go.  Lynch is done.  Stinky.  Stinky.  They're not going to. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, we're getting kicked out of the cab.  Oh.  Get out of here.  Get out of my cab, you perverse.  Alarm.  All right.  You guys, that's it.  Sorry.  Yeah.  No go.  Why are you doing that in my cab?  You made the back of my turban messy.  I believe we have audio of the cabbie.  Stay out the bushes.  Oh, yeah.  Now, Rick and Voss are on the line.  They checked in before the 6 o'clock deadline, so this will be official, Anthony. 
[02:18:30]  Let's go to Rick and the Seam Lockers.  Rick.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  We barely made it into this ATM.  The one was locked, and we barely got into the other, but we got it.  You got the...  We got the ATM.  The ATM.  No two points, because it just wasn't going to happen.  Not after what he did to her over at Rockefeller Center.  All right, Rick.  Well, we're on our way back.  All right.  Thank you.  There goes Rick.  And let's check in with Rich Voss and the AK-47s for the last time.  We did a cab in Central Park. 
[02:19:00]  We paid a lady $10 to have her cab.  She was getting in.  Yeah.  We took her cab.  All right.  First, we offered her $5.  We offered her $5.  Yeah.  And then she said no.  So we gave her $10.  So we took the cab.  Went to Central Park.  I am done.  All right.  That's it.  Competition is over.  So you had the sex in the cab in Central Park?  No, in the cab on the way to Central Park.  And we did Central Park at three minutes to six.  Okay.  Very good.  So we'll give you the points for the cab and Central Park.  Yeah.  Thank you, Voss. 
[02:19:30]  Well, we'll be there in a few.  All right.  And Ben hasn't checked in in well over a half hour.  I thought he would at least check in from the bar that they decided to stop at.  But I guess not, Anthony.  Homeboy must be mad embarrassed, K.  Couldn't do it for my man, Jim.  There you have it.  Sex for Sam 2 is over, Anthony.  Yes.  We will announce the winner in just a few minutes.  And I'm sure we'll have all the couples in the studio by the time we come back from break.  Unbelievable.  A great day for sport.  You know, I always cheer up when it's over. 
[02:20:00]  We have a lot to discuss for the winter meetings, though.  Yes.  A lot of, you know, discrepancies and rule changes.  All right.  Ben, couple need on the stud 100.  There you go.  We'll announce the winner of Sex for Sam 2, Anthony.  In just a bit.  That's not as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me blow chunks.  Oh, great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and A, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:20:30]  What a couple of ass wipes.  Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Oh, yeah.  You braved the beach yet?  You're still trying to fit into that bathing suit?

[02:21:30]  Get on the Stacker, Stacker 2.  Howard, Howard, Howard, Howard, by O.P. and Anthony, serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  We are back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Stacker Sam 2 has just ended. 
[02:22:00]  Anthony's busy.  Anthony is busy adding up the point total.  Now, we have tabulated the scoring, and I have to tell you guys.  Hold on.  Stephen, I see you unfolding your piece of paper.  We have cross-referenced scoring in here, and it was only the scoring that we heard on the phone.  Now, if you did it in other locations, and it didn't get reported here, it will not be added.  There were instances where, let's say, Voss called in and said, we were just in a cab, and now we're here. 
[02:22:30]  Then we added the cab.  But for some reason, the score that you gave me when you came in earlier was not the same score we had here in our studios.  He goes, what a hard-ass you're being, man.  Yeah, I know.  I mean, this is us.  This is very serious stuff, Opie.  Now, listen, wait a minute.  Wow.  Can I say something here?  Yes, yes.  Now, was it or was it not my job to spot the incidents, keep track of the incidents, and then report the incidents? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  At no point was I told I had to report them immediately as they happened.  No, you didn't.  Which I did most of the time, but sometimes we didn't have a chance.  We were at the next location already.  All I know is we tabulated the scores here.  How ridiculous is this that we're on here?  Well, can I at least give you my version of events, and then we can decide if they're fair or not fair?  Okay.  Let's cheat it.  My guys did so much work, and I don't want them to suffer for it. 
[02:23:30]  You know what I mean?  Yes, they did, but looking at my scorecard.  I love how he's fighting for his team.  This is good.  And I'm completely impartial.  I'm not going to win anything on this.  Yes.  They did do a good job.  He even explained to me why he's on.  He said next year he might be a judge.  He doesn't want me to think next year.  All right.  He's just talking into space, Anthony.  Yes.  You've got to talk into a microphone, bro.  No one can hear you.  I'm just saying that.  Steven explained to me at one point when I actually was considering trying to make him cheat,  he explained to me very honestly that next year he might be a judge,  and I met him on another team.  And that made so much sense to me.  Oh, I wasn't saying any cheating's going on. 
[02:24:00]  I'm saying that the official scores that were kept here are the ones that we will go with.  All right.  Anthony, I do believe it's time for the post-game report.  Over on the west side.  Post-game report.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yes.  Yes.  One of the Hungarian humpers had a few beers, Anthony.  And that's okay.  It is Friday.  Right.  All right.  Where are we going to begin?  It smells like gas.  Oh, this is really funny.  Dan on the instant.  What is that, old dirty?  What old dirty?  It just smells like gas in this room. 
[02:24:30]  Thanks, old dirty.  Oh, God.  Thank you for that.  Dan writing in on the SFU back, so practice isn't the only way to be able to play at Carnegie Hall.  Yes.  Tommy from Staten Island, Ben's team.  Ben is the Buffalo Bills of Sex for Sam.  He's always at the big game, but it kind of doesn't matter.  Oh, poor Ben.  And Michael Winslow was supposed to be on our show.  You know, the guy from the police.  Oh, Ben, you didn't hear about that?  No, I saw him in the elevator when I was leaving. 
[02:25:00]  I saw him.  Ben, this is classic.  What happened?  Michael Winslow.  Oh, you guys don't even know because you were out in the street.  Listen to this one.  He's in the green room waiting to come in, which is just outside the studio.  All of a sudden, Stinky.  No, whose team was it?  Whose team?  Was it Stinky's?  No, Lynch's team.  I'm sorry.  It was Lynch's team, yeah.  Lynch's team decides to do the sex in front of a celebrity, Jim Cook.  So she was fluffing him and getting everything ready in one of the rooms. 
[02:25:30]  They get fluffed, start doing the deed, but now they've got to run kind of connected in  some way, shape, or form through where Michael Winslow's sitting into the studio.  Michael Winslow sees this and gets up and runs out of, runs out, and ran away.  No, ran.  Didn't even say goodbye.  Nothing just went.  And this is great.  This is the sound effect he made with his mouth when he left. 
[02:26:00]  See, so it's really good.  You know what's funny, too?  I saw him and Craig from Cowlines when they were coming in.  They're like, hey, Bill, what's going on?  We're excited to be on the show today.  And they were all excited when they were coming in.  Well, obviously, someone else was a little more excited, and it troubled Michael Winslow.  And Anthony, Anthony Frankie from Philly writing in on the instant feedback, Winslow  disappeared from there faster than his acting jobs did after Police Academy 3.  Oh, no.  Thank you, Frankie.  All right, Ann, you know, we've made people wait long enough. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Let's start from last place to first place.  All right.  And then we'll let the spotter talk a little bit and the couples as we find out who wants  sex for Sam, too.  Last place, no real surprise here.  It's Ben and CAC.  Ben cheated.  I cheated.  Simon and Jolene.  Ben and the CAC team.  With 90 points.  Ben, the big question, what the hell happened?  Dude, we went on the roof, and they just went nuts.  I was like, what am I going to do? 
[02:27:00]  They pretty much went to the bar, and, you know, the rest is history.  They pretty much said, F the competition.  This feels good, and we're in a good spot.  Dude, there's nothing like F-ing facing over New York City.  That was too much for you to deal with.  This is the best.  There's nothing better, man.  Yeah.  That's the best experience I've ever been to have.  It is a great view up there.  Yeah, it is really a nice view.  And that was it.  And once you're done, you're done in this game.  Even that, it was just, you know, it was all about, we did it.  Met Open Anthony.  F the experience, and next year we'll come back. 
[02:27:30]  And they're having sex on top of the building, overlooking Central Park,  and Ben's in the corner like Glenn Close with a big chill just losing it.  Oh, well.  Just fell apart once again.  Well, fifth place, a great house.  Shut up, Ben says.  Ben's open and shut up.  You got on the board.  Very good.  Thank God.  You know, it's great.  He's working with a young team, perhaps in a few seasons.  Ben cheated.  Yeah.  But according, I ran into Mark on the street, and Rick completely cheated again, so. 
[02:28:00]  No matter what happens.  Now, here's the one that's going to cause a lot of controversy.  Fourth place is Stephen Lynch's team.  The Hungarian Humpers, Mickey and Timmy.  I've got to say.  Yeah.  Very disappointed.  Are you very disappointed?  Take it up with the board.  Well, I mean, maybe we could go shot for shot here, so to speak,  and I can tell you what I have marked down.  You can tell me what you didn't have marked down.  What was the final score you thought you had?  We had a, with two-point conversions, 264 points. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, see, that's, that's, that, that, that, I didn't have that.  I can, I can, I can document every single thing we were at.  I didn't get the two-point conversions.  See, I thought I was marking it down and just calling periodically to update you.  I didn't know I had to do every single thing.  Oh, now, see, might have to go with Lynch.  I don't know if that was in the official rule.  Oh, then you want to hand the trip over to them?  Go ahead.  Do it.  Go ahead.  I'm done.  No, no, no.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, you did say, you did say, you said, before we left. 
[02:29:00]  The prize has nothing to do with me, so I'm leaving it up to you guys.  You did say call in during everything before this.  Go to the tapes before this, before we left, because you said call in, even if it's happening  or when it just happened.  Okay.  That's why we called in.  We just came back from here or we're heading into the movie theater.  I didn't then call back two minutes later to go, we just did it at the movie theater.  I'm not crashing you.  I'm just going with our points, because, you know, we have a lot of points here, and we  call in all the time.  But, you know, we're talking.  Well, maybe you don't have a lot of points there, boss.  What are you talking about?  I don't know what your score is. 
[02:29:30]  The last half hour, man, we went nuts.  All right, hold on.  So what are we going to do, Ant?  We did everything in the last half hour.  Ant's been the official scorekeeper, so.  We've been keeping score here.  I don't go with any decision to judge me.  I think we have.  Honestly, I think we have to go with your decision, just because you've been keeping track of  everything.  Everyone that came in was written down and tallied up as it happened.  And that was the score I got.  How many points did you say we ended up with?  200.  So we were 64 off.  64 off.  Did you count the two-point conversion? 
[02:30:00]  Do you know what happened?  Yes, every time you told me there was a two-point conversion, I counted.  You didn't mention it every time.  Well, it has to be mentioned because.  Every single one except the first two.  All right.  All right.  Right.  And you know something?  I see that the first one wasn't.  The second one wasn't.  The third one wasn't.  It was still the.  From the third one on, everything wasn't.  The fourth one was 12 points, and that was the first one.  I'm telling you, man.  After the third one.  Because I'll be more thorough next time.  I had a friend of mine calling me constantly to say that you weren't adding it in.  I got that two point, two point.  That one I don't. 
[02:30:30]  I'm going to sit here and argue about this because, well, whatever, you know.  We have to go with official scoring.  I'm sorry.  And next up.  Well, that's.  I'd like to officially apologize to my team.  They got 264 points, but the books say they got 200.  Yeah.  See.  We went crazy in the last 40 minutes and did every place all up and down 57.  All right.  Get him a beer.  That'll make him happy.  Get him a Summer Al.  Summer Al.  Get him a beer.  Sam Adams.  We'll take it next year, man.  We'll take it next year.  Knock him out.  All right, Anthony.  Third place.  Don't even say it.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:31:00]  Is Rick's team.  Team Rick.  Rick.  C Blockers.  Rob and Jamie.  With 208 points, which is only eight points.  All right.  I understand.  Everyone's a little annoyed.  Hey, Rick, did that guy take a shower?  No.  That's funny.  But let's just say this guy was working it.  Wow.  I think we made a tactical error in doing the Yankee Stadium.  That was a mistake.  That really ate up a lot more time on the subways than we thought it was going to.  Might have been better if you kept going and went over to Clinton's office for the other 30. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, I wasn't sure of the address, though.  I wasn't going to take a chance up in that part of the woods, if you know what I mean.  Right.  But, yeah, these guys were great.  And I got to give it to Jamie because, you know, first day, she gets five two points.  Yeah, well, we heard that.  Her face.  Look at her face.  It's still messed up.  We heard that two-pointer.  How was your two-point conversion?  It was awesome, really. 
[02:32:00]  Wow.  Yeah, we heard that one where you went, oh, I couldn't, I couldn't, like, sit on the subway, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, that, that, that happens with the two-pointer, huh?  It's okay.  I needed that 20 minutes we lost.  I needed that.  A little relaxation.  I needed that.  All right, there goes, uh, the seat walkers.  Coming in third place, Ant.  Second place, we have, uh, Voss with the AK-47s coming in with, uh, 220 points.  240.  220.  220, Voss. 
[02:32:30]  240.  It's 220, Voss.  I can name it.  We called everyone.  I don't care.  Huh?  I don't care.  You don't care?  That's my score.  220, and we didn't, we didn't get in a cab but once.  That's good.  And we saved a lot of money.  Now, wait a second.  Great.  I tell you, we did the whole thing.  If it was a competition of who spent the money and who did not spend the money, we would have won.  Ah, wait a second.  You lost 20 points somewhere.  I don't know. 
[02:33:00]  No, you gamed it somewhere.  Well, no, because we had 240.  Okay, well, wait a second.  You said that someone's going in.  All right, I'm going to go in.  You know what we'll do next year?  There will be an official scorekeeper with every team.  That's right.  A spotter and a goddamn scorekeeper.  No, I think we've been.  Yeah.  No, you had to just, you just had to confirm.  All you had to do was confirm the event.  Any final thoughts as far as the competition and your team goes?  My team was great.  They were unbelievable.  They had no conscience.  They don't get right on the street.  That's good. 
[02:33:30]  Right on 6th Avenue.  Right.  They didn't care.  The homeless guy wanted to come with us.  When we ran out of the ATM, there was a guy listening.  He was going, it was like a scene from a movie where we were hunting for our lives.  He goes, you better hurry up.  You're running behind.  Right?  Just some guy with a walkman, you know.  That's classic.  It was great.  But I want to know, did someone say they did it in front of a celebrity?  Who was the celebrity?  Jim Cook.  Jim Cook.  Jim Cook.  Oh, you're Jim Cook.  Yeah.  Oh.  Some celebrity.  Huh?  I think just about all the teams did it in front of Jim Cook. 
[02:34:00]  And to tell you the truth, Michael Winslow was the celebrity that he did it in front of,  and he ran away.  Yeah, we got two celebrities.  All right, so there goes Voss coming in second place, Anthony.  Yes.  And the winner of Sex for Sam 2.  Well, the winner, Stinky's team of Pebbles and Bam Bam.  That they did the two-point conversion every single time.  Every time was a two-point conversion. 
[02:34:30]  With 252 points.  See, Lynch?  Official scoring.  Take it up at the board.  I don't want to F in here.  How many points did they have?  It's 252.  It is Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Stinky, you were phenomenal with your team.  Thank you.  You got off to an early start.  You guys didn't stop.  You checked in more than anyone else. 
[02:35:00]  And every time was a two-point conversion.  Yeah, we got on a roll for a while.  I mean, we had a plaza, a bus, F.E.O. Schwartz, Tiffany's,  Bergen Goodhoffs, and Trump Tower all in like 20 minutes.  Or Bergen Goodhoff.  All two points.  It was great.  Stinky's, the Joe Torre of Sex for Sam.  The Joe Torre.  Yes.  Should we go for a victory lap?  Victory lap. 
[02:35:30]  Victory lap.  Victory lap.  The pressure, the pressure.  The pressure.  Well, I'd like to start off by saying...  You're going to thank your mother?  Thank you to my third-grade teacher who said,  I can be anything I wanted to be.  Set goals and you can achieve them.  Are you going to thank God?  No, no, no.  He had none to do it.  You should.  We saw that junk.  Jesus Christ.  He's not taking my glory.  I saw you in that movie Anaconda.  And does the lady have anything to say? 
[02:36:00]  It was amazing.  Really?  Incredible.  A lot of fun.  Yeah.  And she got the new shoes out of it.  That's right.  New shoes.  She's got the new shoes on.  Two-point conversions.  Halfway through the competition, she had heels on.  People were hurting.  So, we took a break, went and bought some sneakers for her.  Let me ask you something.  Are you a big fan of the, well, we'll call it the two-point conversion? 
[02:36:30]  Even at home?  Absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  At home all the time?  Wow.  Yeah?  Wow.  That's something.  Isn't that beautiful?  That's beautiful.  30 points.  That is a beautiful thing.  And is it true, is it true you were licking the dirty penny?  You were licking the dirty penny to get things going?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't need no stinking K-Y gel.  Right.  More natural.  Opie, he licked the dirty penny. 
[02:37:00]  There's a competitor willing to go above and beyond the call to win and become a true champion.  Yes.  Everyone.  Everyone.  We are the champions, my friend.  Yeah.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Bye. 
[02:37:30]  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  Good job.  Very good.  Very good.  Very good.  Piledriver.  Yeah.  Can we see your stuff?  That's a winner.  The filthy fan chat.  Use it or lose it.  Look what I did to you. 
[02:38:00]  Again.  Hey.  A sound effect for Ben's team.  Oh.  I like you all.  How is it all going?  It's been no bed of roses.  No bed of roses.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  No pleasure.  Daddy.  Daddy.  Good.  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  You're going to get laid.  Hey.  You've got some funky-tasting stuff. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  That's hot.  You take it.  You take it now.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch.  And I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  But dang.  But dang.  They're all pink on the inside.  Huh?  We've got Bush. 
[02:39:00]  We've got Bush.  I got it from the Negro.  I got it from the Negro.  Who's that?  Looks like you're just about to roll it over your wiener.  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Enos.  You're doing your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it. 
[02:39:30]  Roll around like a dog.  How about a nice bucket of hands?  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Yes.  And there you have it.  Wow.  Stinky's team of Pebbles and Bam Bam.  The winners of Sex for Sam 2, Anthony.  Unbelievable.  Jim Cook, any final thoughts?  Oh, I'm going to be proud to have them at our brewery.  Yes, we will.  That's right.  You guys got a trip to Boston?  Yes, Stinky.  One more thing.  I have to give thanks to Eric and Mike, the two perverted spotters. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, you brought them up?  The whole time.  Look at this guy in his Celtics jersey.  Yeah, you should have been following Ben's team around.  I was calling from the unemployment office today.  I just figured.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  What other show do you hear that on?  Jesus.  Is she upset?  Is she all right?  Yes, she does.  What she was telling me in Hungarian was like, you know, that she was FTDA so many times that she knows she won. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, no.  All right, listen.  We'll wrap up this mess next.  Yeah.  Maybe play a little What Did We Learn Today, okay?  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  And I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater of the Mindless.  102.7 WNEW announces our new fall lineup starting Monday. 
[02:41:00]  Sports Guys Mornings.  Don and Mike.  Middays.  Opie and Anthony Afternoon.  Ron and Vince.  Knights.  Our new fall lineup starting Monday.  102.7 WNEW.  Anthony, O2Go.  Yes, O2Go.  You want some water?  Hmm?  What, that tastes good?  And it's distilled.  You know, we talked to the guy from O2Go.  Distilled water tastes like crap.  But then he figured out a way, but it's good for it.  And then he figured out a way to oxygenate it.  So it tastes great. 
[02:41:30]  No minerals.  No crappy tap water.  Once you taste O2Go, all other water tastes like crap.  That's right.  And they got flavored water, too.  Cranberry, lemon, lime.  No calories.  If you're drinking flavored water with calories, switch to O2Go.  And it's got eight times more oxygen than other bottled water.  It's great for your workouts.  Things like that.  You won't get muscle cramps.  No chemical additives.  It boosts energy and stamina.  Keeps you focused and alert.  It's oxygen, for God's sake. 
[02:42:00]  We love oxygen here.  It's our favorite gas.  Wouldn't you say?  I love oxygen.  Oxygen rules.  Coming in a close second.  Nitrogen.  What did I learn?  Oxygen rules.  O2Go.  Pick it up.  O.B. Anthony.  H.E. W.N.E.W.  And we're back with the O&A show.  If you're not in the New York area, give us a call at 866-277-4WOW to get in on what 
[02:42:30]  did you learn on the O.B.  and Anthony show today.  And what an education we all got today.  This was better than going to Harvard.  Right.  See?  Nice.  If there's any couples in the New York or New Jersey area that would like to hire me  to follow them around while they have sex.  Now you're experienced, Vaughn.  Yes.  Yeah.  How good was that today, Vaughn?  I had so much fun.  It's not the sex part.  The stuff that was happening as you were doing.  The homeless guy goes, can I come with you the rest of the day? 
[02:43:00]  Right?  The fact that we're in another radio station's van.  Yeah, that's a little weird.  All right.  And that guy goes, yeah, I listen to O&A all the time.  How long is that van driver going to have a job?  And then we'll hire him here when he gets fired.  It was so much fun.  This team, they were really, really good.  Everyone, what a great job.  Yeah, without a doubt.  All the teams did.  It really, I don't know, it reminds me of the great sports figures of the past. 
[02:43:30]  You know, O.J. Simpson.  O.J. Simpson.  Well, he was pretty good until he killed people.  But, you know.  That's true.  Yeah.  That's true.  Let's go to J-Rock in Delaware.  J.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I am J-Rock.  All right.  Quick.  Two from yesterday.  I learned that thanks to MTV, the whole world learned how to act black.  Yeah.  And I learned that sex is so easy, even a child can understand terms. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, that's right.  That's from yesterday.  Okay.  And from today, I heard, learned that a bunch, the world's a bunch of freaks and perverts.  All right.  I learned that Sam Adams can get you pretty twisted.  And I learned that Stinky is the master of Sex for Sam.  Stinky is the sexual Phil Jackson of Sex for Sam.  Yes, that's right.  All right.  Thank you.  Peace out, honkies.  Why don't you shut up for about a week?  I'll catch you with that piece of honkies. 
[02:44:30]  Honkies?  Honkies?  What the hell is this?  The Flip Wilson show?  Hey, honkies.  Yo.  Anthony Jersey Gary, what did I learn on the O&A show today?  I learned only a loudmouth Jewish comic would even think of asking a homeless guy for a  receipt for $5.  Hey, boss.  He also learned females can get Bell's palsy by taking it in.  That's stupid.  That's stupid.  We found out why Michael Winslow ran out of here. 
[02:45:00]  We actually found out.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's the reason?  He's got something in the works with Disney.  Oh, God.  And Disney and das Dumpere Sex really, really doesn't go together unless it's a gay Disney  day down there at Disney, which they do every year.  Then it's just, it's accepted.  Yeah.  But Pirates of the Caribbean.  You might have been on that ride.  Today I learned the four-legged beast roams the whole side of the WNW studios. 
[02:45:30]  Didn't that look great?  I swear to God, when they came in, it looked like something from the Discovery Channel.  Didn't it?  Because he was corralling her.  With his arms.  Here we have the alpha male.  Subjugating one of his female.  Yeah.  I'm waiting for all three to go up and bash heads with them.  Are you talking about my couple in front of Jim?  Yeah.  They look like that at every single location.  Really?  It was just some kind of primal Discovery Channel effing. 
[02:46:00]  Anthony, check out this obscure one.  Anthony writes, I learned Stinky will be bringing his perverted teens home to cover the rent.  Oh!  Wow.  What a memory.  What a memory on that guy.  Obscure reference of the day right there.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  No one's going to beat that one.  That was a good one.  What else we got here?  Pat, I learned that any girl associated with Ben's team will only find a stiff one at  a bar.  That's pretty good.  Hey, I learned Opie must have rooted for Ben's team. 
[02:46:30]  I rooted for Stinky's team.  Wow!  The jinx is broken, kid.  It's on record.  Jerry writes, today I learned Stinky has a future announcing golf tournaments.  Yeah, he had to be quiet.  You were funny, Stinky.  I'm here at the 18th hole.  Jerry also learned, if you ooze, you lose, that the PLJ van now smells like it does deliveries  for the Fulton Fish Market.  Oh, my God.  And finally, Jerry writes, your feet get sore when you take it in the Stumpfair. 
[02:47:00]  Mike from Hoboken, today I learned these women will be sitting in inner tubes tonight.  Let's go to Jason.  Jason, what did you learn today, man?  I learned, without a doubt, Sex for Sam is the greatest sporting event ever in the world,  guys.  Definitely.  Stinky rules.  Stinky rules. 
[02:47:30]  Stinky does indeed rule.  All right.  Don't they call the Indy 500 that, the greatest spectacle in sport?  Yeah.  No.  I think Sex for Sam is taking that over.  Because what, you know, you watch some cars go around.  Is that really a spectacle?  You're watching horrified people on a bus as the Discovery Channel's going on in front  of them.  That's a spectacle.  Hey, you know, the good thing that is for Ben is he has another couple he can call at  four in the morning when he's drunk.  Hey, you guys want to get together? 
[02:48:00]  What are you doing, man?  Let's go out.  Phil, what's up?  How you guys doing?  Great.  Hey, listen, I learned that not only do you guys up around all day, but you get everybody  else to do it, too.  Yes.  Usually we're the only ones.  You guys are great.  Hey, thanks, Phil.  Take care.  Okay.  Okay.  Wow.  God, what a day.  I learned a lot today.  Oh, Jim, you learned something?  Yeah.  I learned, first, I learned, just like Sam Adams, you've got to start with a brown long 
[02:48:30]  neck.  And just like Sam Adams, you've got to have a great body.  Yeah.  And you've got to have good ingredients and a rich, creamy head.  Right.  And you don't need good taste to enjoy it.  My nigga, Jim Cook.  I'm having a summer ale right now.  Yeah, Old Dirty comes running in.  That's my man, yo.  Jim Cook, my nigga.  Cheers, baby. 
[02:49:00]  As usual.  Sex was saying, part deuce, baby.  Part deuce.  Part deuce.  Yeah, that rocked today, man.  Let's see.  Rory writes from Philly, what I learned today, anal on a rock in Central Park plus homeless  man plus four perverted teens equals triple word score.  That's deep.  I think I actually saw the fisheye today right there on the console.  Right?  Remember that from yesterday, the fisheye? 
[02:49:30]  What's the total fisheye?  Right when you do the balloon knot.  Yeah.  But what's the move that makes her turn around?  Oh, no.  You start in the normal spot.  Right, right.  Then quickly, you jam it in the balloon knot, and when she turns her head to look at you,  it looks like a fish's eye because she's really surprised.  Yeah.  Come on.  You ever see that big flat fisheye looking at you?  Who?  Like a garami in a fish tank or something? 
[02:50:00]  Huh?  What happened?  What the hell was that?  Ikea boy, he learned that oxygen is cool.  Oxygen's cool.  Any final thoughts?  You know what, Hefty's places we went, we were on camera in all the elevators and the  stores and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  A lot, they had, you know, there's people everywhere watching this, you know, the security  and stuff.  Oh, there'll be tapes that people will be reviewing for months and months and months.  Did Michael Winslow actually say, Feats don't fail me now, when he ran out? 
[02:50:30]  I'm getting reports that he yelled, Feats don't fail me now.  Is that true?  Let's go to Anthony.  Anthony, what did you learn today?  Yeah, I learned that the closest that Rich Voss can bring his act to Carnegie Hall is to  watch two people bang in front of it.  Stinky beyond Thunderdome!  How has everything turned into a slam against me?  And praise for Stinky, you know?  Hallelujah.  Amazing, man. 
[02:51:00]  Jim Cook, we did it all for you, okay?  It was all for you.  What up, kid?  It's amazing what people will do for Sam Adams.  Yeah.  See that?  Can I have a big party up there?  I got to go to Philly real fast.  Chris, what did you learn today?  I learned that people from Delaware shouldn't play what I learned today on O&A.  Good job, Chris.  Thank you, guys.  All right, bye.  Yeah, you should listen for a couple of days first and then maybe participate. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  Pantera writes, just like Ben's Boston Red Sox team, his team choked again.  Oh, man.  Ben, two years in a row, my brother.  She didn't choke.  She just let him finish early.  Jim Cook is open, kid.  His eyes.  He's open.  All right.  What a great day.  Well, we're exhausted.  What a day.  The couples are exhausted.  The spotters are exhausted. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  They are.  They're like Olympic athletes.  At least nobody died of heat prostration.  My female team member, Jamie, is finally able to sit down.  Really?  I see some guy out there, yeah.  Yeah.  You're on a bag of ice.  On an ice-cold Sam Adams.  And, uh...  Oh, please.  Just got to let you know.  We need the empties back.  Jim Cook, everyone.  During the heat of competition, my guy, Rob, actually had to run into a bathroom, take his 
[02:52:30]  underwear off, and throw it in a garbage can.  It was that bad?  He's free-balling.  We could have auctioned those off on eBay.  Well, go to the Ian Schrager Hudson Hotel.  We've got to get out of here, Anthony.  Yeah.  What a great day.  What a lot of fun.  You thought today was good radio.  Listen next week to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's going to get real interesting.  Let's just say a lot of surprises, a lot of new beginnings, a lot of old friends.  There will be a huge surprise next week. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  And it's not the fact that we're going to be live on WJFK Washington.  We are?  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Starting Monday.  Ron and Fez broke that one.  We got some more surprises for you.  I like the people from Washington already, male.  We haven't uttered word one.  Word effing one in Washington yet, and we're already getting, get off.  You suck.  What?  Don't even sweat that, my brother.  This is steamroller radio.  If you're in the way, you're going to get stepped on, punk. 
[02:53:30]  We got the real deal right here.  Right here.  O and A, coast to coast, you know what I mean?  Jim Cook in the house, Sam Adams, Sex for Sam Part 2.  What more do you want?  Remember, we got that from Philly at first, and now there's nothing but love coming from Philly.  Anthony, more cities for old D to rob.  That's right.  Son, I'm opening up in all new markets.  Yo, I need a plane ticket, Mr. Cook.  You can't! 
[02:54:00]  It's going to get real interesting.  Oh, yeah.  Our first radio war.  We'll start next week.  Good start.  Oh, we're going to win that.  It's going to be a fun one.  It's going to be a fight, bro.  Word up.  Yeah, no.  You got Sam on your side.  It's going to get real ugly starting next week.  Oh, I'm at it.  And we're not talking about Washington.  It's going to be like beating up a small child, so we should bring Norton in.  He's got the experience.  Yo, do we need bulletproof vassises and all that?  Nah.  Because I got all that equipment. 
[02:54:30]  Nah.  It's going to be an easy one.  Oh, it's going to be easy?  It's going to be an easy victory.  It's going to be sad.  Really sad to watch.  Yeah.  Like a good ass.  Pretty pathetic.  All right, you guys.  Once again, let's hear it for all the couples that are participating in Sex for Sam today.  And, of course, the winners, Anthony.  Stinky's team.  Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Stinky.  Stinky.  That's it.  That's it.  Give us the victory, Wu.  Ying Yang party. 
[02:55:00]  He's drinking a red bull and vodka.  Look at him.  Have yourselves a great weekend.  Stinky rules.  And we'll see you guys Monday at 3.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Peace.  How old are you?  18.  All right.  For your shirt on.  Wow.  Fabulous.  Wow.  Hopi.  Ravioli.  Hopi.  And Anthony.  Anthony, we're just live in New York right now.  Yeah.  Hi, New York.  We love you. 
[02:55:30]  You guys come through with your perverted couples.  I wonder if we can do this in other cities.  Yeah, we're going to have to have like a national competition.  We've got to figure it out.  Take the champion from New York.  We might have to just travel to all the cities and get like regional winners.  And then bring it all to New York for the grand finale.  Yeah, make it a federal crime while we cross state lines.  Hey, by the way, Stinky's, one of his team, Cornell, was complaining.  What did Stinky actually do?  It was him doing all the work. 
[02:56:00]  Stinky did a great job of setting up security.  He got a couple of guys to play lookout.  And what does Joe Torre actually do?  Come on.  You know what?  Cornell was just a little upset.  Stinky did such a good job that he didn't even know Stinky was doing anything.  And that shows you're doing a great job.  That's right.  And speaking of great job.  I just have to read this really fast.  Yes.  Bill from Jersey.  I learned two things today.  With a little help from Sam Adams, anyone can nail a girl in Das Duup.  Das Duup.  Das Duup.  Das Duup.  Das Duup. 
[02:56:30]  Das Duup.  And two, sounds of fans as Cone pitched a perfect game.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Sounds of Dale Earnhardt dying.  Horrifying.  Yeah.  Sounds of Sex for Sam contestant taking it in the A for the first time.  Priceless.  Yeah.  We got to isolate that because when you hear her go, we got to play that Monday.  Because that sound doesn't come from anywhere else.  You could stub your toe.  You could get punched in the face, hit on the back of the head with a sledgehammer.  You are not making that sound unless your balloon nod is being violated. 
[02:57:00]  Dude, when I poked my head in through the door, because it was like through this door, and I looked in, and all I saw was her face pressed up against the wall like that.  Yeah.  And she just goes, ooh.  You know, sometimes the athletes grunt to get the extra what they need to put it over the top and win.  Yeah.  Like a power lifter.  Right.  Anthony, a big part of Sex for Sam today was, of course, Sam Adams.  It's all about Sam Adams.  Jim Cook was here today for the entire Sex for Sam competition, and he is a master. 
[02:57:30]  Shocked and appalled.  Shocked, appalled, great.  And we love it.  We're doing a live read for Sam Adams.  So, Jim, what do you want to say about Sam Adams?  It's effing good beer.  He knows what show he's on.  Very good.  It's a great feeling as it goes down your throat.  Nice.  It has dense, creamy head and almost symphonic complexity as you taste the body and sweetness 
[02:58:00]  of the malt.  Oh, my.  Symphonic is a big word.  Then segwayed into the spiciness and the bitterness of the hops.  Wow.  That's my word.  Symphonic.  L-O-U.  You know what I like about Sam Adams' beer, Jim Cook?  I like the fact that the bottle isn't cheap.  It's a good bottle, so when I drink the beer, I can smash my bitch over the head with it.  That's right.  And she is going to go unconscious. 
[02:58:30]  Unconscious.  I don't think you brought Mike Tyson.  Unconscious.  L-O-P-C-A-T.  Unconscious.  Older, do you have anything to say about Sam Adams?  Sam Adams.  I can't say enough about this brew, my brother.  You can't even spell it.  Yo, man, shut up, punk.  It's too long.  Come on.  Here's Sam Adams.  Yeah, man.  Shut up, punk.  You know what I'm saying?  You're digging, right?  Trying to diss me in front of my man, Jim Cook.  Dude, I'm about to...  Man, I'll give you a drop kick.  You're about as hot as a fan with one blade, punk. 
[02:59:00]  You better chill.  Better parlay when I'm out here.  O.D., you walk in.  You see Jim Cook's here.  You see he's got his cooler bag.  What are you thinking?  I'm talking about my man got like three pounds of hydro, unlimited fillies.  Man, we're talking.  Unlimited fillies.  Again, open, my brother.  It's open time.  Unlimited fillies, Jim Cook.  Yeah, kids.  You make the best stuff, kid.  Oh, toast.  There you go, man.  I got a look at it.  There you go.  You, too, should go out and pick up some Sam Adams. 
[02:59:30]  You're at the bar.  Buy some for your friends.  You're at the supermarket.  Get some for the house, man.  It's great to kick back, watch some TV, sipping on a Sam Adams.  We may change our whole motto after this Sex for Sam contest.  It might be Sam Adams helping shy people have sex.  For 17 years.  Jim, you did a lot of radio shows.  Which show was your favorite?  That's right.  This is the best.  Was your family at you, Jim?  Was your family at you, Jim?  He is family.  That's right, man. 
[03:00:00]  What other station do you walk in on and seeing a Hummer in progress?  The second you walk in.  He walked in the door, looked over to his right.  She was fluffing the guy.  And he looks over and he's just like, oh, I'm in the right place.  He goes, I was just ready to put the bottle to my mouth.  I don't think I'm sucking this one down.  No.  Jim, thank you.  No, I'm proud of you guys.  All right.  Fantastic, man.  Jim Cook.  And Sam Adams. 
[03:00:30]  And we'll see you guys Monday at 3.  We'll see you next time. </pre>
