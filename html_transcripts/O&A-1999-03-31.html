<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a boisterous promotion of "Whip Them Out Wednesday" (WOW), a campaign encouraging women to flash other drivers. Opie and Anthony excitedly detailed the plan, referencing its prior success in Boston and predicting a significant impact in New York City. They introduced a humorous "boob index" to predict sighting frequency based on weather and discussed using a map to track reported sightings, suggesting listeners use MapQuest.com for this purpose.  Several callers shared their experiences; Ed described a similar successful promotion in San Antonio, while others recounted their own WOW participation, both successful and less so (one caller received a ticket for indecent exposure after flashing a female police officer).  One caller even described a situation where a woman flashing him caused a humorous marital dispute.

A large portion of the broadcast then shifted to a retrospective of their infamous April Fool's Day prank from the previous yearâ€”the false report of the Boston mayor's death.  They recounted the fallout, including their firing from their Boston radio station and the ensuing media firestorm. Their boss, Scott Herman, made a surprise studio appearance to caution them against repeating such a stunt, reminding them of the severe consequences. Opie and Anthony assured him they wouldn't repeat the prank.  Throughout the show, sponsors such as MapQuest.com and Priceline.com were mentioned.

The show also featured a call from Spike, a dominatrix, who described an upcoming session with a client who enjoys being treated like a baby.  Finally, Opie and Anthony discussed old promotional materials and played a voicemail left by a former on-air personality.  They provided detailed instructions on how women could participate in WOW, encouraging callers to seek further guidance, and suggested men display "WOW" on their vehicles to show support.  The entire broadcast showcased the show's characteristic blend of outrageous promotions, listener interaction, and recounting past controversial events.

[00:00:00]  are mightier than each of them individually i agree and yes and after the mess that van halen  put out last year i think that they'd be open to the idea you know and if david lee roth wasn't  such a mess i guarantee they would tour with david lee roth at this point he's just a mess  though yeah you're right he's not going to be able to do anything for that band so no i'm going to  predict sammy hagar joins van halen you think so within the next few months yeah within the next  few months yeah i think you're right all right hey what's up look at this day

[00:03:00]  of mouth it's it's part of folklore up in boston now and well we'll give it a try down here and we'll  see what happens well wow stands for whip them out wednesday that is what wow is that sounds a little  crazy i understand sounds a little nuts you're right but if you want to talk to some of the people we uh  we turn on to wow trust me it works now the uh the nice weather comes around so you don't have to  worry about catching a chill uh the guys driving home in rush hour traffic it's it's a bitch we try

[00:14:00]  just no emotion nothing we were worse to them than the murderers now what time did you go on  the air last year was it four o'clock in the afternoon no three o'clock so at what point that  day did you know that your career in boston was over uh honestly we thought we were going to skate  yeah it was looking good yeah because we were like unstoppable up there up until we realized there was  no other news happening and then they really started snowballing we noticed like it was making the  five o'clock six o'clock news eleven o'clock news and then it was just snowballing yeah when the mayor  had to hold a press conference to say he was alive when he got back to lost they knew we were 
[00:14:30]  screwed it was over we knew we were screwed what was that the next day because he was still flying  back from florida yeah he's got a real bad speech impediment i mean mayor giuliani seems like a  speech therapist next to this guy so he got on tv and he's like i want to say i am alive  obi and as of the uh reported i'm dead i am very angry i need two people he talks like andre the giant  yeah so we uh we were we thought we were untouchable we had the number one uh show in boston yeah by far
