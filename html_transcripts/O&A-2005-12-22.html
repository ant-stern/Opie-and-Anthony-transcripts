<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a heated discussion about the New York City transit strike, criticizing the striking workers and highlighting the resulting traffic chaos and negative impact on businesses, especially during the Christmas shopping season.  The hosts touched upon perceived racial undertones within the union's demands.  They then transitioned to detailing their exploits on Paltalk, describing "room raids" of sexually suggestive chat rooms and playing offensive sound clips.  One listener, "Lucy," famously flashed her breasts on camera.  Personal anecdotes followed, including accounts of their own difficult commutes and a humorous examination of Ben Sparks' unusually frugal expense reports, contrasted with potential gifts from Elo.

Guests Big A and Twitchell joined for a news segment, interspersed with a caller, Will, suggesting a game for their betting show, and Lou, a person with Tourette's syndrome, who shared his experiences with the condition and cannabis use.  Several other listener calls were briefly addressed. The show concluded this segment with a replay of their older bit, "Tourette's Whorehouse."

The next segment started with sexually suggestive banter about a woman at a fish market, immediately followed by a bizarre in-studio event involving a man named Bill undergoing some playful, potentially humiliating, act with a "liberator." Phil's distress was noted. This was followed by a comedic Christmas gift exchange, themed “the spirit of taking,” characterized by playful banter, insults, and the stealing of gifts.  Gifts included loofahs, a Kiss ornament, Guinness, Barnes & Noble gift cards, an Ozzy Osbourne poster, and a squeaky rubber chicken. One staff member received a t-shirt reading “I bring nothing to the table.” Many staff members participated.

This segment concluded with another Big A and Twitchell news segment, dominated by repeated prompting of Twitchell to jump, leading to frantic jumping and exclamations. A bet was placed on how many times Twitchell would jump during a song containing the word "jump," resulting in a win for a staff member.

The following segment featured a chaotic appearance by Louis Twitchell, whose Tourette's Syndrome tics and outbursts prompted laughter and astonishment from the hosts.  Twitchell discussed his condition, referencing Jim Eisenreich, and promoted his website, laughterbylue.com, and upcoming show. Big A also participated.  A significant portion focused on a feud with Dice Clay, playing audio clips of Clay criticizing the show's move to satellite radio. Opie and Anthony countered with angry responses, accusing Clay of ingratitude and hypocrisy regarding freedom of speech.

The show also included a listener complaint about a poorly produced Outlaw Steaks commercial (involving Steve, the sound engineer), the creation and rejection of a new character "Toby" (voiced by Sam), and ongoing "Wow Sticker" promotion.  Further discussion of Dice Clay and speculation about his career decline concluded this portion.

The final segment began with off-color jokes and derogatory terms used to describe fellow comedians. A listener called to complain about a Paltalk ban, leading to a humorous discussion of pardons.  A chaotic cereal-eating scene followed, involving the hosts and Jimmy, resulting in a physically and verbally abusive interaction with Kashi cereal and blueberries. This segued into a discussion of their family habits, specifically unusual pronunciations of "blueberries."  A call about appearing on "High Voltage" was taken, followed by more cereal-related chaos.

The conversation then shifted to OxiClean as a laxative, leading to graphic descriptions of explosive diarrhea, including one host soiling himself.  Danny's father then called, sharing his own experiences with unintentional defecation and his habit of walking around naked.  A Big A and Twitchell news segment, interspersed with more off-color jokes, preceded a final betting segment involving Big A attempting a tongue twister.  The show concluded with plugs for upcoming events and personalities, and a brief appearance by Stalker Patty delivering "raspberry starfish" chocolates.

[00:08:00]  was good i was gonna call you and say you know what why don't we just call it a day and just like take  thursday off i am on mt today nothing in the tank done i i i went to sleep i probably it's just after  seinfeld so i guess maybe 11 40 something like that up before four can i ask you a really dumb  question certainly knowing that there's a transit strike in new york city knowing that you have to  get into manhattan before 5 a.m before the whole four uh people per car thing starts yeah why would 
[00:08:30]  you stay up till 11 40 good question valid question because i know you probably hit the road at what  four in the morning 4 15 in the morning yeah yeah uh why not get very good question you're you're  absolutely right that is a good question uh truth is if you look back and remember when we first  started mornings it was very hard to get acclimated to the time um we used to go go home and i i know  i used to nap and it would fuck my whole time schedule up i stopped doing that when we went to 
[00:09:00]  7 to 11 so now i go home i can enjoy the rest of the day and go to sleep yesterday i got home sat in  front of the computer and fell asleep in the chair kicked my shoes off went on the couch boom asleep gone  once i nap and it wasn't just a quick 45 minute nap it's over johnny right then i'm up and i can't  get back to sleep that night it's we have had these conversations when we first started here i was 
[00:09:30]  reading an article on napping and they say if you go at uh more than 40 minutes you're just screwing  up your whole fucking up the whole thing you're supposed to nap somewhere between 20 minutes and  40 minutes that's it three hours i napped oh that's not enough i woke up and there was no getting  asleep early right i just wasn't tired until i pretty much forced myself after seinfeld i put on  that 70s show and it was like instant sleep yeah that's it so uh i crapped out and then up at four  and the drive-in and you know i could bitch about it for hours i'll make it brief how bad it was 
[00:10:00]  yesterday twice as bad today i was getting text messages uh on my drive-in from steve uh he was on  the other side the jersey side trying to get uh across and he goes is it bad for you too today  because it's 10 times as worse as it was yesterday and today i guess everyone from yesterday that  came in before the five o'clock hov thing yeah in new york you have to have four people in the vehicle  uh in order to come into manhattan uh from five o'clock a.m to eleven o'clock a.m so i guess 
[00:10:30]  yesterday i came in you know i left at four i got in it wasn't much of a problem today i guess  everybody told their friends yesterday got a great idea just come in before five and it's great  so yeah everyone is figuring out how to work around this uh nightmare dude 4 30 is now 4 30 a.m where  you can drive blindfolded 90 miles an hour into the city on any given day is now rush hour it is now  the new fucking rush hour where i drove up uh a good two miles before the midtown tunnel 
[00:11:00]  dead stop dead fucking stop traffic how annoyed were you i knew it was coming i i was annoyed but  you know i was looking at the clock on all right it looks like i'm gonna make it and then i when i  got through the tunnel and was in manhattan i uh texted steve i go i'm in i'm in i made it and he  goes i'm in i don't i don't know if uh the rest of the country understands what's going on in new  york city with this transit strike so bad al-qaeda is pretty much controlling new york city right now 
[00:11:30]  this is exactly what al-qaeda would love to do they would love they would love to shut down the city  and they would love to affect the economy that's exactly what is going on with this transit strike  no matter what time of day you go out on the streets of new york there's just a cattle call  of people just walking and walking and walking because their bosses don't understand they're  starting to interview these people where the bosses are like hey man you get into work i gotta make a 
[00:12:00]  living i gotta make money so i don't give a fuck how you get here you have to get here and you talk  to some of these people they're walking five miles each way three and a half miles each way uh they  interviewed one guy he's walking like 15 miles each way for a night job yeah you know that's exactly  what al-qaeda wants to do to new york city yep you know and even if al-qaeda was able to like uh blow up  one of the subway stations or something uh-huh the city wouldn't be in lockdown like it is uh today  no they would still have a way of getting around and most of the other subways and buses would 
[00:12:30]  still work right yeah they figure it out and then bring up uh some of the lines so this is uh in my  opinion this is exactly what al-qaeda wants to do and i was uh doing some christmas shopping last night  and uh you talked to some of these business owners like some of these mom and pop places they're like  dude we're screwed we were counting on the last three four days before christmas to make all our money  for the year you know they they they stockpiled all the stuff they want to sell and and they said  no one is coming in to buy uh christmas gifts restaurants 40 off 40 off of their usual business 
[00:13:00]  right they're they're they're struggling here right and uh you know the the people that are on strike  they want our sympathy it's like sorry in our little world you have really fucked a lot of people up  you ain't getting it you know this isn't a mill in iowa that is striking against the owner for uh  you know because they're being treated poorly this is a a subway system and a bus system transit system 
[00:13:30]  for the biggest city in the world that they have made a law against striking it's breaking the law  it's the bottom line just get the fuck back to work and let your bosses and management negotiate your  deal uh this is be a blackmail it's extortion and it's uh uh torturing the people in new york  uh so you can get what you want there's gonna be some action today there's a they're threatening uh  throwing some of these guys in jail oh would that be great but there's gonna be some major action 
[00:14:00]  today you watch throw them in jail you watch there will be and i don't know that arrogant  fuck in jail the guy that can't say mta mta mta mta and he was having a good old time up there in  harlem tuesday when this transit strike hit where was he he was in this uh really really nice restaurant  and uh joint up in harlem and he walked in everyone gave him a standing ovation and he was he was enjoying  the lap of luxury while everyone else was uh striking and walking the picket lines and uh and then you 
[00:14:30]  and everyone else not being able to get around on the subways and the buses he's up there having a  fine meal tuesday night underlying racial thing that's going on with this whole strike i know  there's plenty of white transit workers i've seen you know on the picket lines and everything but  there's this underlying thing because of this motherfucker that's in charge uh that that like  reverend al is now coming to the side of the transit workers uh they're they're talking about things 
[00:15:00]  like being offended that the mayor used the word thuggery that these people are using thug tactics  and uh one of their their little mantras that they uh they chant when they're marching with their signs  are we want respect and stuff which is just something typical of uh like uh uh the black causes  and the black marches it's always about you know respect and and respect who gets it's not respect  on the fucking job who gets respect at their job what do you want respect it's not a negotiating 
[00:15:30]  point fella respect no one gets respect you want to raise based on your merits that's how it works  that's how it works people are arguing well you know if we don't strike what are we going to bring  to the bargaining table how about your fucking merits how about what you do uh on the job how about  you get paid for the better job you have uh or the better you do it uh another sticking point they had 
[00:16:00]  was too much disciplinary action they don't want as much disciplinary action being taken against employees  that take days off that are late that are what excuse me it's a fucking job be here be here on time and you  won't have disciplinary action taken against you they want to retire at 55 that's what the retirement  age is right now for the transit workers that's fine and dandy they don't want to touch that the mta said 
[00:16:30]  they're not going to raise that but any new people just joining they want to push it up to 62 too right  uh and that's a big sticking point you know a lot of people's retirement age is 62 some are 65 some are  older it's the way it works it's part of the fucking job you don't like the job get a new one  fact is you get a lot of pretty good benefits most people would love to retire at 62 yep there's a lot  of people out there that know they can't do that right all right here's the mayor and his latest 
[00:17:00]  comments on the transit strike here in new york city this illegal and selfish strike let me talk a  little bit about that it needs to end and it needs to end right now today in court we are asking for  a temporary restraining order against the twu and for the judge to again order the twu back to work  disobeying this order would make the individual members of the unions liable for serious financial  penalties and this i might point out is separate from the mta suit which is costing the twu one 
[00:17:30]  million dollars a day in regards to that legal action twu members need to be aware that they are  already losing two days of pay for each day they do not go to work if you do the math that means for  each day they're on strike they lose one percent of their uh income for the year oops some shit's  gonna happen today you watch one percent of their income for the year let's go to the day every day 
[00:18:00]  let's go to jerry in iowa jerry jerry jerry go jerry come on guys we're off jerry jerry you stink you suck  and your mother's a whore why don't you take a long walk off a short pier jerry he's from iowa  where's up here they have lakes you want to say that no one cares oh people do care and then new  orleans was checking in and new orleans got their own problems we understand yeah but he's like man 
[00:18:30]  thanks a lot everyone has forgotten about us yeah we forgot about you guys about a month ago that's  the reality of uh the world we live in sorry iowa sorry uh the pinnacle of the free fucking world  is in a little turmoil here as you sit there and and uh see if your corn is frosted out in the  fields exactly shut up fucking iowa love being a national show these days well i'm uh the camera's  up hi say hi to everybody yeah we're doing uh we're doing webcams now yeah we're doing a little pal 
[00:19:00]  talk we we asked xm for well over a year we said look we want a camera in our fucking studio how hard  could it be they have cameras installed but for some reason they don't turn them on for uh the  listeners they're scared but they they have them for themselves they can pass foot but they have  them for themselves so they can check on us at any time down at the uh the compound in washington  yeah so we can't wait around for xm to help us out so we took it upon ourselves to uh anthony did 
[00:19:30]  actually he got a webcam and at this point only like 300 people could uh check out the show yeah 300  people can uh come into this room and uh but we got plans for more webcams we're gonna try to  throw one in our office i think it would be very interesting for our listeners we got to figure  out sound they can hear us pretty good uh it doesn't sync up with the xm signal because there's  a little delay right but they could hear us in the mic on the camera but they can't hear the phone  calls or the sound effects so we got to figure that out for them and uh we're we're doing it though 
[00:20:00]  we're working it out slowly but surely right a lot of people checking in though every day which is  pretty cool and uh it doesn't end here with the show by the way at night these people these  fucking animals get on and uh about 50 of them or so and me and jimmy were in uh one of the rooms last  night and they go on uh room raids where you just pick a room usually it's a gay room or uh an african 
[00:20:30]  room uh lesbian room and just come on and play sound clips from the show uh that are just so  repugnant and hysterically funny so what happens someone uh gives the cue and everyone goes right  into that room yeah like usually dug out doug will say say you are invited to such and such a room he  goes around hunting for a room do a little recon and then invites everybody and you click yes and all  of a sudden you're in that room and just start pounding people just pounding them we ended up in 
[00:21:00]  an insult room it's a room full of people insulting each other and uh we were in there for a good hour  and it was hysterical there was some clown in there this big guy uh like friggin steroid head with  tattoos he's wearing like a yankee wool cap and stuff and just sitting there smoking cigarettes and we  were just lambasting them just bashing them i'm getting on talking about how uh uh did he start  taking the steroids after his prison stint while he was getting fucked up the ass by black guys like 
[00:21:30]  just pounding them and he had tats and stuff and some jewelry and a tongue piercing that he kept showing  and uh doug was hysterical he gets on there instead of being like everyone else on the insult side side  he's like yeah well you're a poopy head let me tell you something poopy head and uh they're taunting  doug to get on camera get on camera so finally his camera pops up it's just black he comes on he doesn't 
[00:22:00]  have his shirt on he like taped a dvd to one shoulder and some kind of ipod thing to the other  shoulder look like the guy that was tattooed put a yankee cap on and starts flexing and had some kind  metal thing in his mouth where he could barely talk it was so fucking funny that everyone in the  insult room you look at their cameras they were laughing hysterical and they were just a bunch of  miserable fucks very very funny dug out doug had the uh the play of the night with that one but it's 
[00:22:30]  just it's fun it's a bunch of animals just bashing the shit out of each other it's all about the pal  talk these days that's it jimmy i got to see uh jimmy yeah i got a camera apartment oh my gay color  yeah gay color i commented on the gay color of his wall which is being fixed by the way and what  is that little shelf behind you with the light oh i had a i had a the the way it looks like black  onyx or something yeah you know a little shelf nice that's what i'm gonna eat when i'm at the  dining room table oh i want to eat there but i don't have a barstool yet uh it was lovely i i was 
[00:23:00]  laughing so hard um when they would just go on these room raids and then you start it's like 30 people  insulting everybody in the room yeah i guess faggot hey homos nice roll got aids give me aid yeah got a tissue  like oh thank you robert reese says i like your asshole i fucked arthur ash it was just nonsense  really funny man it's so bad and then you get uh what's called bounce from the room you know  if you you abuse them sometimes they're quick on the bounce sometimes they're a little slow you get  some more shit in but uh you get bounced and everyone regroups back in the other room and then 
[00:23:30]  doug will go on recon find another room boom you're back in and it's so immature and so fucking funny  uh that it's uh it's it's a nighttime hobby for these people what room are you guys in for the  uh people that want to join you well uh let me think uh i think it's a whack bag on a pest talk  or something yeah one of those you know something if you're uh clever you can find it you'll figure  it out you'll figure it out if we put it out there it just turns crazy because we have something 
[00:24:00]  we have a little problem going on with uh our room that i made i thought calling it opie and anthony  live uh would be good thing it tells what it is and everything but uh someone looked up opie  there's some type of tie-in between the word opie and something arab are you kidding muslim  yeah i i know every morning you're like oh i gotta kick out the arabs i'm like what are you talking  the rag heads gotta go so you you set up the camera and all of a sudden the room gets flooded 
[00:24:30]  with arabs gets flooded with arabs because opie means something to the arabs there's some kind of  kingdom some kind of throne thing so they all load in thinking it's something like that and it would  be fine if you know they just wanted to hang out and and watch but they're constantly like abusing  the women trying to get them to show their tits they hold the mic down we don't leave it alone  yeah but we're white people oh god bless good point and they're holding the mic down and they  won't shut up so uh they get the boot they get the boot well we got to find out what this is all

[00:33:00]  you rule yes okay september 26 2005 a fully i mean this is a three-page report okay with the form  descriptions attached receipts for coffee and gum for jim norton for three dollars and six  all right he expensed coffee and gum okay ready for this one yeah this is again october this is  september 26 so this may be it must have been the one day he decided to actually like turn some of  them in but never got it to me all right this one is for two dollars and fifty eight cents opie money 
[00:33:30]  for milk for coffee well in a year that can build up okay now if you think obviously milk has obviously  decreased in price because on october 9th he expenses and this may be an all-time management  record an expense report for a dollar twenty nine for milk for coffee at offices  jesus ben is a chiseler and just in case you're curious he got it the duane reed one 
[00:34:00]  134 which obviously is the one right across the street so he didn't go far yeah i'm surprised he  didn't charge me mileage for that now here's the big one here's the big one uh-oh ben  is coming in to try to defend himself wait wait i want to hear elo first go ahead elo a big one just  came in here for november 23rd where he actually spent seventeen dollars and twenty cents food for  patrice o'neill oh you got to see what patrice eats when he's here i took patrice breakfast i took 
[00:34:30]  patrice for uh... for lunch uh... after the last show he did for us last week right or two complete meals  oh yeah i don't at that joint we go to jimmy yep um and postal mike is commenting uh elo i bet you'd find  no combs on that list or soap or anything else so expensing a leaf blower  but the funniest part about this is how you guys never have any money 
[00:35:00]  we have the money open up i need milk two bucks for milk so i get expensive don't you lump me into  that i'm not i'm not saying you don't want me into that i've noticed there's no anthony expense  listen i know you will not find one anthony expense on that whole thing there isn't one anthony expense  i'm an idiot for not doing it but here's another one here's another one is that ready this is october  30th ready yeah cab money for bill burr for eight dollars and twenty how did he know bill burr needed  exactly eight dollars 
[00:35:30]  yeah look at that you can't accuse better cab i mean i don't  that was actually he actually he actually does detail  it's like fifty seven street studio bill burr home three seventy  bill burr home to fifty seven street studio four fifty so what the cab ticket detour i mean i want to be the  same amount of price all  all  so you know when his family came over it was ben sparks a wits  and then they just cut it short uh... to assimilate to the country a little more 
[00:36:00]  and make it go to the production  you make a great accountant  well here's the february nineteen two thousand five  yeah all right  and again i'm approving expense reports for almost  ten months ago  there is a statute of limitations by the way  ah  new orleans trip  okay  uh-oh  he spends a raft  did he buy a kayak yeah  kayak just touch it  dinner at the royal sinesta hotel  that's where we say that's gonna be big 
[00:36:30]  thirty one dollars  did he just eat by himself  no no that was actually in actually poe  poe came in and ate on that and then left me on that one so that was the two of us  wow  yeah thirty one dollars wow  nothing here but here but here's what you don't get then you write lunch on the receipt  and you put dinner on the report  you know i was trying to get those all in by the fifteenth there was a lot of i found expensive  it was like three o'clock  i didn't know  lunch dinner  that's great  wow  i mean you spent more money on postage staples and paper 
[00:37:00]  actually wait a second at the end the end total is pretty is like five hundred bucks though  yeah but i could lose half the exchange reports and go to four ninety five  i swear to god i've never seen anybody in any company i don't care big or small expense  something for a dollar twenty six that's like writing a check for a soda  i'm an idiot i am an idiot man i should be expensing like  if i have to stay in a hotel because of something we're doing  like i know we did the the halloween party and stuff and i had to stay in town 
[00:37:30]  uh for that i can expense that hotel room  but i just i i don't bother  we don't hand in expense reports  it's paperwork  this brings me right back to high school  when a report was due  and i was just the guy that never handed in shit  even though it was for my own good  corporate america  i'm right back there  purposely does that  because i looked at the expense report one day and i was like  fuck no am i gonna i'm not dealing with this  i know it's all complicated  i think i've handed in one  in a year and uh  whatever 
[00:38:00]  i'm actually expensing my apartment  so you're gonna be getting something from me  mortgage  i'm technically based out of l.a. now  so this is all like uh  you know work travel  so thanks  your expense reports are actually quite comical  have i had any i've had a couple but not many  yeah tiffany  bambi  yeah just girls names  i don't even know who these people are  this is job interviews  that's all i know  yeah they help me write material for the show  if you're a writer  you know  at least get creative and like padded  it's sort of like you know  uh market research or something 
[00:38:30]  happy ending  elo we appreciate the great radio you're giving us  but we have so much to do today  yes  all right i'm out of here  by the way  happy christmas  happy christmas  it's merry christmas  i was gonna say happy holidays  fuck the happy holidays  merry christmas  it's christmas everybody  that's right  can i have a gift  all right boys  merry christmas  can i have a gift  all right elo  can i have a gift  eric can i have a gift  he will not get hung up on  i want a gift  you want a gift  i want a gift  well let me tell you something  i'll let you in on a little secret  what's the secret  i don't know if you're involved  but i would  i would  i would assume  uh-oh  don wicklin 
[00:39:00]  called me last night  and asked me  he goes uh  elo wants to know  what your address is  i'm like  oh okay  why are you saying this  all right  because i'm assuming  that there is a gift  on the way  well let me tell you something anthony  i got that same call  from don wicklin  yes i know  i heard from don wicklin  i was doing some shopping  and my phone rang  it was don wicklin  and he said  what's your address at home  because elo wants to send you something  that's what i heard  jimmy did you get that call 
[00:39:30]  oh no  um no  i  maybe they have my address  lol  they  they probably just already have your address  they probably know it offhand  right guys  they probably just have my address  they talked about it before  oh no  anthony the last couple days  has just become a scumbag  i think it's because you're not sleeping  it really is  and you have to get up so early  to beat that 5 a.m curfew  i'm genuinely a nice person  because you never do this type of thing 
[00:40:00]  i know  you know that  if don wicklin called  looking for your home address  yeah  and i got the same call  i wasn't going to bring it to everyone's attention  i'm assuming that  pretty much you and i  are the only ones getting gifts from elo  oh well  i think elo should include  and elo if you're listening  i think jimmy norton  should be included  in any gift giving  fuck no  i like gifts  he is an integral part of this program  no no  and i'll tell you why  it's because the listeners  have taken upon themselves  to send in a lot of great gifts  to uh jimmy norton 
[00:40:30]  what do we get  a power drill  a power drill  you get some  you get a gift every day  i get something addressed to robert reed  uh  you got godiva chocolates yesterday  or something  but i always give them away  the gifts that keeps giving  i uh  i give them away to the uh  the folks around here  i don't need them  all right  but no they probably have my address  i'm sure they wouldn't  they wouldn't do that  i'm certain of it  they must have my address  i am absolutely certain of it  but if they don't  it's never too late to call  no  for my address  for things  gifts and stuff 
[00:41:00]  elo  let's go all the way to seattle  wow  it's uh will  will  early  what's up  good morning boys  how you doing  hi  all right  courtney love is broke  uh a little seattle tie-in  courtney love is broke  and she wants to sell the uh  the uh nirvana catalog  for like a hundred million dollars  hundred million  hundred million dollars  you gonna buy it  or that  whoo whoo  only whip out my wallet  maybe i could buy  hey uh  guys  you ain't getting away with that shit  not today my friend 
[00:41:30]  man i'm glad i got that  hey uh  i got an idea for your betting thing  not that long ago  you guys did a bit  where you had big a  uh you had bill burton ceo  you wrote down things on paper  and had big a say sexy things  to blind christa  while she was masturbating  oh  did that make one of the best bits of the year  i hope it did  that was one of the best bits  we uh we did since coming to satellite radio  that was pretty damn awesome  well hey slightly altered  i think you can make a competition out of it  okay  get a couple pests in  no filter ball  big a 
[00:42:00]  stocker patty  whoever  uh and then  bring in five guys  like fan  e-rock  whatever  put them in a chair  their job is to keep an absolute straight face  have your pests up there  and then whoever's betting  put the money into a pot  divide it by however many you guys  you have sitting in the chairs  well  he's  lost me  oh  okay  i was there  but what  okay  put the money into a pot  and then  let's say you got five guys in a chair  they've got to keep a straight face 
[00:42:30]  they cannot laugh  divide the money five ways  each one of those contestants  they've got an individual pot  now your guys betting  they take turns  they write  right on a  all right  holy shit  stunk  holy shit  that stunk  we are going to do the big betting show  in the very near future  yeah  maybe early in the new year  we're trying to figure out  all sorts of great bets  we can do with the people  that are associated with the show  right  speaking of big a  he's outside the studio  and  oh he made it 
[00:43:00]  and there he is  because he said he was having a problem  getting in  oh really  yeah earlier he was on pal talk in the office  big a come in here  it's so funny to listen to him  because you'll see he'll get the mic  yeah  and uh  because you get a little mic prompt  when you have the mic  and you're  you have the floor  you're able to talk to everybody on pal talk  and  it's just the biggest delay  and then you just hear  hi guys  click  it's off

[00:46:00]  nerve wrack  yeah just a tad bit  just a tad bit  he's a comic too  Jimmy  that's cool  all he's got to do  is beat  yeah a little bit  in New York  mostly out of  South Jersey  I'm friends with  brown boy Jimmy Graham  who's on  Murderer's Row tour  with you  oh yeah  he's uh  you're 20 years old  right  yeah 20  9-11  9-11 I was born  yeah huh  wow  oh god  I need some more  coffee right  yeah maybe a Red Bull  yeah oh yeah 
[00:46:30]  Red Bull makes you  the coffee in Red Bull  Jimmy doesn't know  what to think of  we're used to him  already  yeah he's been in  here three or four  times Jimmy while  you've been in LA  being a star  what are we doing  in LA  this is the first  time you've seen  him  shooting a show  is that the HBO  sitcom I heard  yeah  congrats on that  man that's awesome  oh god  so how have you  guys been  how was your week  uh pretty good  pretty crazy  sucky with the 
[00:47:00]  transit strike  yeah  we're muddling  through  oh I can only  imagine  it sucks  20 blocks  I had to walk  yeah  do you take  any kind  of medication  is there  well to be honest  with you  Jimmy doesn't know  what to think  well I told you  guys before  I'm just looking  at his face right  now  I've never seen  Jimmy like this  before  what's going  through your head  Jim  um  did I  it's got to be  very difficult  yes  we're not setting  you up by the way  he's the real deal  I know he is  I've had certain  tics in my life  it's just never  that severe 
[00:47:30]  I'm always  I don't want to  it started  like watching  him  it's not  it's not  it's not  it's not  it's not  it means  my neighbor  has this  he'll do it  every now and then  I'll do it  like a facial tics  never been that extreme  but I was diagnosed  when I was seven  with it  what was your question  about my weight  I had nervous  like blinking  a little bit  when I was a kid  yeah  like oh it's  blinking real hard  not like crazy  person blinking  but every so often  I felt I had  to blink real hard  that was about it  I mean  you know  that's like  having a hangnail  and going to a 
[00:48:00]  cancer patient  this hurts  yeah  but uh  what was your question  about the medicine  you said  yeah  are you on  any kind of  medication  well  I'm not  medicated  and I haven't  been medicated  since I was 17  because the medicine  was what made me  300 pounds  it made me increase  my weight  in routine  oh that's right  you were like  that's why  yeah  that's how I lost  the 85 pounds  because I said  I'd rather twitch  more and be thinner  than be morbidly obese  and you know  basically be drugged out  but did the  did the medicine  keep you from twitching  I'm sorry guys 
[00:48:30]  hold on  oh please  don't apologize  it's just been nuts  some of the medicine  did good  one medication  caused me heart trouble  the other was  the weight problem  and then  they just couldn't  find something dead on  you name it  I've been on it  it was a mix  of depression  and Tourette medicine  howdol, renolin,  prozac, clonidine,  prolixin  it's just a whole bunch  of shit  but I'm glad  I'm off it now  say fuck it  yeah  I'm living this life  so it's my choice  and I'm non-medicated  I just  I have other sources  of medication 
[00:49:00]  and you know  yeah  I just gotta live my life  do you smoke the pot?  I'm telling him right  um  well  my children's book  just came out  a couple months ago  so I don't know  to answer that question  let's say  based on your own experience  to be honest with you  I am an advocate  who the fuck would blame you  are you kidding me?  you know what  I am an advocate  of medicinal marijuana  right now  they've done studies  on how it does  benefit those  who are afflicted  with the disorder  you know like  Tom  excuse me  was it Montel  for MS 
[00:49:30]  he's an advocate  for those reasons  to help people  let's say if you  smoked a joint  if you did  okay  would it  would it calm you down  and keep you from twitching?  oh that's a fucking  understatement  it feels great  really  it really  mellows it  and it's to the point  where it's like  five or ten minutes in  it's actually  calming  calming onto the effect  and I'm the one  where it doesn't really  affect me mentally  but it calms it down  like I'll be  like some nights  I'm twitching so bad  like my neck  I can't sleep  because I started  getting neck pains  and my doctor said  since I don't want  to be on tarot mass 
[00:50:00]  he said well  what about muscle relaxers  just you know  and I said I don't  want to mess with that  so yeah  sometimes it does  get really bad  what?  can you get Vicodin?  I don't forget  what it was  but he did  I already have  a written prescription  for whenever I need it  I can get it  whenever for  let me just say  whoever invented  that drug  it could be Vicodin  I forget  should be given  the Nobel Prize  you're obsessed  with Vicodin  Vicodin's fantastic  what about drinking?  drinking's good  I drink every now  and then  and for the most part 
[00:50:30]  does it help out?  same thing  common feeling  I mean I get  like everyone else  shit faced  and stupid  but I don't  tick as much  when I'm drunk  but the marijuana  is definitely better  than the drinking  as far as common  I've never seen  Jimmy speechless  you are speechless  yeah I've just  kind of been  watching and enjoying  on coke  I hope we're not  making you feel  uncomfortable  not even a little  have you ever tried  or let's just say  has anyone with Tourette's  that you know  ever tried coke  and have you ever  seen the reaction  well I'll just say  straight out  I never had done 
[00:51:00]  anything other than  you know  because I don't even  want to mess with that  I don't want to  take a chance  but I don't know  anyone who's had Tourette's  who's done it  but who knows  I'm sure there's a lot  I just picture you  looking like  the Tasmanian devil  all you'd see  is like this  little tornado  and you'd be  buzzing around  the room  because that  would be fun  to see  well I've had  ecstasy offered  to me before  I turned it down  I'm just afraid  I'm a pussy  when it comes  to that stuff  I just don't  want to try it  oh god 
[00:51:30]  Jimmy is speechless  is it hard  having like a  girlfriend  you know  it's difficult  it's difficult  and to the point  where I don't  think I've ever  had one  consistent  steady relationship  I mean I've had  my share  but I think  as me  I mean I'm an actor  primarily  I've been doing this  for 12 years  and I want to keep  doing this  it's my living  and I don't think  I need that  especially having  Tourette's  I just don't need  that pressure  does it affect 
[00:52:00]  roles  is it hard  to do roles  to be honest  with you  acting is my  best medication  you know  the only reason  why some people  in the industry  know I have  is because  I've been in  the media  and what not  that's how I know  it  but they would  not know I have  it just by  meeting me  I can control it  when I'm doing  a cold reading  I've been on set  and even when I  do my stand up  for some reason  I'm able to put it  on the shelf  for a little bit  that might be tough  to incorporate  into some roles  your honor  Rachel 
[00:52:30]  you've come  back  Jimmy last time  he was here  we made him  drink Red Bull  for the first time  Red Bulls and coffee  he had two Red Bulls  and a coffee last time  yeah  two Red Bulls  and a coffee  you know why  because he came in  and he was a little  too mellow  well I took the  liberty of having  three coffees  prior to getting here  and I haven't hit  up the Starbucks  machine yet  I love coffee  in general  well here's the deal  we got Twitchells  and Big A  they're going to 
[00:53:00]  do the news  after the break  I think we should  do it early today  if it's written  and ready to go  yeah sure  alright  Jesus Mary Joseph  it just looks  exhausting  it is  doesn't it  it looks like  every muscle  like you're  constantly working out  it's like  yeah  it's like  you think  masturbation  takes a lot  out of you  this is like  doing it  24 hours a day  did we ask you  about sleep  could you get  a good night  sleep  yeah like I said  very rarely  where I have it  so bad  like last time 
[00:53:30]  I had it so bad  where I couldn't  sleep and it affected  it  it's like  six months ago  I get usually  once or twice a year  I have the really  bad nights  where I'm like  usually  like I can't  stop  you could sleep  all night usually  well you ever see  that movie  this is a good  example  Robert De Niro  I forget what  it is  but he was  Awakening  Awakening  and it was  like that  where I was  a totally  different person  it's like I  seem like a  completely different  person  and I'm doing  this constantly  and I can't  stop it  and I saw  that movie  and it cracked  me up  because it was  like watching  my childhood  that's exactly  what I did  it more  when I was  younger  but yeah  for the most  part I can

[01:06:00]  everybody  every Christmas  it seems  Big Kev  brings gifts  and we  bring  nothing  why don't we  bring gifts  I don't think  to do it  I don't either  I am imbued  with the Christmas  spirit  is that what it is  what's imbued mean  yeah if you use  that word again  we're gonna smash you  you know I went to  hot tea in your face  fuller  you'll be imbued  with salve  and other things  to remove  scalding liquid  I went to Big Kev's  Christmas party  as I attend  every year  and he does 
[01:06:30]  something called  the spirit of taking  yes  it's very interesting  trademark  you bring  a gift  wrapped up  they all go  under the tree  and then you  choose numbers  and then the  corresponding numbers  are then chosen  out of a hat  by Kev  let's say  you're number  four  he chooses  number four  you can go  to the tree  and grab a gift  then the next  person  say they're  number 15  pick out  number 15  they now  have a choice  they can grab  the present  under the tree  another one 
[01:07:00]  or steal  the gift  that the person  just grabbed  from under the tree  at which point  that person  then goes back  to the tree  gets another gift  take another number  and it goes  it can go  on for hours  where people  just want  to steal  the best  looking  wrapped gift  which usually  turns out  to be the biggest  piece of crap  we've noticed  over the years  the best looking  one  the one  that changes  hands the most  is usually  one year  it was bubble  wrapped  yeah  it was a  five dollar  minimum  and it was  five dollars  worth of bubble 
[01:07:30]  and I ended up  with like  one of the  prized possessions  this year  it was wrapped  in tubes  it looked like  a bazooka  the way it  was wrapped  up  and it  turned out  to be  three foot  long  loofah pads  and some  lotion  ugh  just horrid  but it looked  great during  the game  it's the spirit  of taking  but last night  I'm watching  office space  no the office  the show  the office  they were doing  that  ripping me off  ripping you off  hoo hoo  they were calling 
[01:08:00]  it something else  but they were  doing it  unwrapped  also  which was a  little odd  how do you  do it unwrapped  then you know  what's good  and what's bad  that's stupid  yeah  it's gotta be  wrapped  that's a  great idea  though  yeah  it's the spirit  of taking  by the way  you smell lovely  today  thank you  someone has to say it  yes  you smell  lovely  thank you  absolutely  a little  you know  had to get out  on the air  it was an awkward  moment  a couple days ago  so I just want  to let Kev know  he smells lovely  if you saw a blind  man walking 
[01:08:30]  into traffic  you would tell  him don't walk  into traffic  no I wouldn't  because it's funny  to watch him  get hit by the car  what's funny  is to hear  the dog  get hit first  and then just  to hear him  going  hey scraps  hey scraps  scraps  and holding on  to just pulverized  meat on the end  of that white  handle  and he notices  that he's walking  and now all of a sudden  the thing is behind him  like hey  where's scraps  here boy  meanwhile  his fucking little  head was crushed  I remember the horrified  people walking by  as he's just talking  to meat on a stick  are you okay 
[01:09:00]  are you laying down  for a rest  poor little guy  you want to pass out  your gifts there  I like gifts  everyone seems  very anxious  yes  I need Steve  and Ben  Travis  everybody  Travis  all of them  Ben  Danny  alright get everybody  where's Jimmy going  I'm going to get some water  I'm dying of thirst  I don't want to ask  the interns to do it  it's just Christmas  I'll do it myself  where's Jimmy going  Jimmy is leaving  his post  why are you leaving  your post  can I have a water bill  please  and you guys  get in here for gifts  alright  there you go  leave your post

I don't know  why do you change  you guys?  that's what they got me  they didn't have  the seven whole grains  which I love  I know  there was one  that tasted like  I love you  it was very good

I don't know  he ran out to the bathroom  the coffee gives him  the shit  maybe he fucking shakes  and he's dropping logs  all over the place  you know  a nice diarrhea dump  he goes  it shoots out 
[01:19:00]  like you pulled the cap  off a fucking fire plug  and he fucking  tips off the bowl  oh we wanted to  do the news here  so we'll wait for Twitchells  I guess  oh that's distracting  when he's eating a girl  she's getting close  oh oh  that's a  if he does the  it's probably good  if he just goes  because his lips  will like move  real quickly  how many people  are going to our  dinner aunt? 
[01:19:30]  yeah that's another  thing  the uh  Christmas uh  the Christmas dinner  it's now an extravaganza  let me tell you  what happened  uh  Pat from Munaki  came into the studio  one day  a few weeks ago  and  told us  just a  horrible story  of his  youth  his upbringing  and his  holidays  right  it was around  Thanksgiving  uh  we were all  talking about  what we were  going to do  I was going  over my  families  Opie 
[01:20:00]  his families  everybody  spends Thanksgiving  living with their  family  big turkey  the whole  traditional thing  we asked Pat  what he was doing  and to our  horror  he told us  he was going  to Boston Market  like he does  every year  and sit  and watch  some videos  at his  hovel  I can only  imagine  and uh  that's it  so we kind of  felt bad for him  we got the  whole story  about how  his father  left  shortly after  he was born  uh  lives very close  to where he lives  close to where 
[01:20:30]  he lives now  he was raised  by his mom  who died  I think when he  graduated high school  uh  then he's alone  at that point  but his father  lives very close  to him  in Munaki  uh  he knows where he lives  he knows his name  but he doesn't feel  like going up  and talking to him  uh  there might be  some issues there  with perhaps  the father has  another family  he's happy  I don't know  I don't know  it's just horrible  so  me and my  girlfriend figured  uh  we're not 
[01:21:00]  we do things  on Christmas Eve  that's my family  thing  I go over  uh  to the grandma's  house  we have a big  thing on Christmas  Christmas day is  Christmas day is  pretty much  wide open  wide open  so  I figure  Christmas day  or night  uh  we'll go out  to Christmas dinner  and bring Pat  from Munaki  and have like  a very Pat  from Munaki  Christmas  something like that  well  all of a sudden  a couple of names  started getting  added to the list  I don't know  where  who  how  they did  but  more and more 
[01:21:30]  people started  getting added  to this list  message board  people  people I don't  have any problems  with  it's not like that  but just  it turned from  this very small  thing  to help out  a guy that just  has shitty  Christmases every  year  to now  a huge  I think there's  25 people now  and I'm not  exaggerating  I think we're up  to 25 people  where are you guys  going  yeah I  add more people  a restaurant 
[01:22:00]  in Manhattan  yeah  the big apple  ant  yes the big apple  the big city  you guys gotta  like record this  yeah  you gotta get  video  there'll be video  there always is  because  people  these people  bring camera  crews with them  video cameras  still pictures  they're all over  websites and  everything  so  now  something came  up in the  office  where now  I guess  Paul  wants to go  and who else

[01:23:00]  just a casual  knowledge  well  might have to  switch the place  and Anthony  told me in the office  he's only going to pay  for the first 20  that show up  by the way  that's nice  pay for  20  there had better  be some deal  struck  I'm going to  I'm going to  dine and dash  and leave  Pat from Munaki  with the tab  how great would that be  would that be great  Merry Christmas  you gotta get  nine toes  you gotta get the video  you know this is a great idea  Eric  who came up with this idea  so we don't  Big Cap came up with this

[01:27:00]  a news script  that the staff  puts together for them  like any anchor  anchor men  on a news program  they have their writers  right  and the teleprompter  that goes in front of them  but this is all  alright  I'm looking at the story  and I love  some of the words  that Big A  has to say  in his stories  it really seems  a little forced  just to  tear down  the fifth wall  the guys 
[01:27:30]  rewrite the script  they use a lot  of ST words  knowing that Big A  has a problem  with the ST words  but I heard  last week was classic  when he ended  his newscast  with have a stupendous day  yeah  they wrote in  have a stupendous day  I heard Than  in the office though  there was a little  controversy  there was some ST words  being used  and Than goes  no STR words  he doesn't seem  to have a problem  with those  like Dan's  figured it out  the STRs  you don't have  that much  of a problem  with 
[01:28:00]  not too much  no  yeah  so you won't  find any of those  in here  alright  well  I guess  they can get  started  anytime you want  Lou  you're up first  Lou can I ask  you something  sure  jump  jump  fuck  yeah  I fucking  hate you  I just got  a little info  during the break  if you say  jump  jump  he's gotta  jump 
[01:28:30]  just first  I can control  it sometimes  Van Halen  jump  just please  jump  alright listen  listen  alright listen  you bastard  you motherfucker  listen  I gotta explain  what happened  Twitchells has a friend  he brought  Tommy  Tommy  and I was going  to the bathroom  and they caught me  on the way  and they go  dude trust me  if you say jump  he has to jump  he's jumping like crazy 
[01:29:00]  jump  here's the deal  let me explain  a part of Tourette's  syndrome is OCD  OCD is a part of it  jump  and what it is  what it is  is  it makes me want  to do these things  and one of my biggest OCDs  is I have to jump  jump  jump  jump  jump  jump  jump  jump  jump 
[01:29:30]  jump  who said that  oh this poor guy  he's living in hell  oh god  I didn't think  it was possible  wow  thank you guys  thank you for making  my life extremely worse  you bastard  I hate you  jump  jump  jump  come on  oh fuck  give him a break  Opie  no no  I haven't fun  but the jumping one 
[01:30:00]  is the one  take the bugs  the hell out of me  because I've been  walking down  because of the whole  thing with  the taxi cabs  I had to walk down  the whole time  I'm jumping  walking 20 blocks  I've got a question  for you  what is it  with jump  it  it's  the thing is  OCD  when someone has OCD  some people  wash their hands  repeatedly  some people  have to open  and shut doors  I used to have that  well when I hear  a certain word  in this case  jump 
[01:30:30]  I have to do  the meaning of it  which is jump  and actually HBO  did a documentary  I was talking about  that last week  and one of the kids  on the show  demonstrated that  take  that's a really  common tip  with Tourette's  people just  randomly jump  and both feet  have to go off the ground  it's part of my OCD  and Tourette's  you got OCD  and Tourette's  well OCD  comes  affiliated with  Tourette's syndrome  so someone just says  jump and you have to jump  sometimes I can control it  like I'm really focusing  right now  you have the urge  if somebody says  jump  yes I definitely  have to  fuck you  oh my god 
[01:31:00]  I'm not angry  it's just like  when it happens  energy boosts through me  because I have to  jump up in the air  this could be  the greatest thing  ever  is there any way  we could rewrite  Big Ace news stories  real quick  here you go  take the script back  is there any way  and is there any way  that I think  would you be willing  to hold a cup  of hot coffee  in each hand  there's something  perfect about the word 
[01:31:30]  I'm not going to say  jump  there's just something  perfect  it's a full word  it is  just jump  it almost feels like  what it is  to say jump  you almost want  to jump too  no matter what  please get this online  please get this  on opianthony.com  because this is  such a great visual  okay  nothing else  though  I still have dignity  like slap your face  or anything  my sister tried  to do that  start a new

[01:33:00]  The part of OCD  Where you're watching  Something on TV  Or people watching a movie  And something's in the way  Like at my house  There was a fan  That was always next  It wasn't in front of the TV  But it was next  And I can't have anything  In my peripheral vision  When I watch TV  And that bothers me  I mean that's part of the OCD  And it's just  And that's just how it is  Sometimes I'll take  Wow  My right finger  Like I like  Jump  I like to take my right finger  And tap  Tap it against the hard surface  Really?

[02:01:30]  Right?  Oh, my God.  I am the winner.  The song is over, right?  Wow.  Oh, man.  I underestimated.  Holy shit.  I had 36.  Who won?  Did you really?  I had 35.  What was the official count?  The official count was 36.  And that last one was at the end of the song.  Kev got it.  Big Kev nailed it.  36.  How many did Kevin give me for my bet?  26.  That's fair. 
[02:02:00]  Jimmy had 35.  That last one came as the song was fading out.  That still counts.  It was 25.  I've never been this much out of breath in my life.  I think you guys have just pushed me back about four or five years of therapy here.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Let me tell you something.  I've been doing radio a very long time.  Yeah.  That is the funniest thing I've ever seen.  I...  Doing a radio show.  I...  I am speechless.  I'm speechless, too.  Guys, I'm having a blast.  I know this is real.  In my head, it's like the gerbil going in the wheel, and the wheel won't fucking stop moving. 
[02:02:30]  It's like going nuts.  Yeah, you can see.  You're just, like, losing your mind.  I'm having fun, but at the same time, it's like, you know when you're, like, you've had  so much caffeine, and, like, you're just going nuts?  It builds up, and he tries to control it, and then it explodes out.  You've got to sync up the song and get this video online.  Have to.  Look at this.  Look at this.  I'm sweating, like, literally.  This is all wet.  Like, with a word that doesn't mean anything, like the word yump.  Would that make you do it?  Well, I'm trying not to think of the word yump.  Oh, shit.  All right. 
[02:03:00]  Chuck O from Indiana.  Chuck O.  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Chuck O.  Hey, I was driving on my way to work, and when Jimmy held up that sign, I almost just went  right into the goalie.  Ate shit all the way down.  Wait till you see the video online, man.  Well, drive safe, man.  You've got to get to work.  Don't be a chump.  All right.  Oh, you bastard.  Let's go to the Joker.  Hey, morning, boys.  What's up, Joker?  Hey, man.  Oh, hey, Twitchell.  You'll want me $100.  A hundred bucks, buddy. 
[02:03:30]  When I see you, dinner's on me.  Oh, thank you, man.  I appreciate it.  Let's just not order any rump.  Yeah.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Do you hate when you're driving and the sign at the gas station says pay at the pump?  Well, first of all, I have a license, but I choose not to drive until I feel more comfortable  because I don't want to be twitching and running at an intersection.  Oh, wow.  Oh, I never thought of that.  Well, as a responsible in a Dell, I'm choosing.  There's no law against it.  I'm just choosing to take my time.  Well, there should be a law against it. 
[02:04:00]  Let's be honest with each other here.  Lock us up in a cage.  No driving.  You like baseball?  Oh, I love baseball.  Well, and the reason why I always wear my Phillies cap is because Jim Eisenreich of the Philadelphia  Phillies, he went to the World Series with them.  He had Tourette syndrome, and he also went to the World Series with the Florida Marlins  when they won.  Jim had, I met Jim twice, and he did a talk about Tourette in the Philadelphia Veterans  Stadium in the locker room, and they invited me down there.  And when I walked in, all these kids were grunting and twitching, and it was the first experience  I ever saw anyone else with Tourette.  So I wear my Phillies hat everywhere as a reminder. 
[02:04:30]  Well, did he ever have problems with the ump?  Yeah.  I consider myself the lucky, lucky, luckiest man in the dream world.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, a lot of people are saying this needs to be on TV.  See, this is a clip that you should be able to download to your fucking iPod.  Ah, absolutely.  Or whatever you're using, the PSP.  Who wouldn't want to trade this around? 
[02:05:00]  Right.  Ah-ha.  Let's say hi to Mike in California.  Mike?  Yeah.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, I just want to say, I've been listening to your phone for like two years since the  WNEW day.  Yeah.  I bought an accent just for you guys, and this was the best radio I've ever heard in my  life.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Tell a friend for us.  Tell a friend.  That's awesome, man.  Thank you so much.  That's how the virus is going to spread.  Tell a friend.  Oh, and he fucking rocks.  Oh, and he rocks, guys.  These scumbags, they're writing the word jump. 
[02:05:30]  In front of their cameras, hoping that he was actually watching.  He can't see various cameras.  He can't see them, though.  What cameras?  You're on camera for that.  For Pal Talk.  For Pal Talk.  For which camera?  Oh, I thought you were talking about meh.  That guy that was in here with you.  Oh, yeah.  No, we filmed that for the website.  Okay.  So we could bring everyone.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  All right.  We're going to let you rest there, Twitch.  Yeah, we'll let you take a little breather.  I think we're going to do more news with them.  Yeah, a little later, maybe.  Yeah, I don't mind coming back.  One more news chat before we get out of here for the holiday. 
[02:06:00]  I'm going to plug for the gig, though.  Yeah, you've got January 7th.  Wait, plug all your stuff.  The website.  All right.  My website is...  Thank you so much, guys.  My website is laughterbylue.com.  Lou is spelled L-O-U.  Laughterbylue.com.  And my show, I'll be at the...  You've got a MySpace account?  MySpace.  Wow.  Louis Twitchells is my MySpace appearance name.  Louis Twitchells.  Guys, all kidding aside, support this guy, man.  Yeah, well, my show, thank you so much. 
[02:06:30]  He's been giving us unbelievable radio the last three or four weeks.  Well, my show, do you want me to plug that?  Yes, plug whatever the fuck you want.  Thanks, man.  Well, my show's coming up.  Give me your fucking home address.  Maybe a girl will come over and bang you.  Yeah, maybe Elo will send you a gift.  Ooh.  Comedy...  January 7th at the Comedy Cabaret.  Where is that?  North East Philadelphia.  And that is Saturday, January 7th, as Jim Norton said.  And I'll be there at the Comedy Cabaret, North East Philadelphia.  And my website is laughterbylue.com.  You can check the schedule page for all the details. 
[02:07:00]  And Little Twitching Timmy's my book.  Buy it.  All right.  Take a break, dude.  You're going to explode.  There he goes.  Twitchell.  Cool.  Great job.  There he goes.  Big A, very good job, too.  What else do I have on my space?  Big A 614.  Big A 614.  A lot of people...  Way to take an easy-to-remember number.  I know.  A lot of people ask me all the time.  Every day I get emails going, what is Big A's MySpace thing?  Yeah.  And then I...  The name is waste. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  There are so many people that are so moronic out there.  It's like it's easy to find Big A's MySpace thing.  Go to anyone from the show.  You can go to Jim Norton and troll through his friends.  Right.  Absolutely.  You'll find it.  All right.  I think we are...  I think I might have a bet for Big A.  Maybe we'll do one more bet before we get out of here.  I got a big A?  I got a big deal with you guys.  Yeah, I think we might be able to figure something out.  Is the show on out there?  Yes.  It's cool.  It's a good job.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  Wow.  It's...  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Oh, my God.  He's jumping outside.  Jump.  Look at him outside the glass.  He's got to rest.  He's got to rest.  Larry and Philly.  Oh, my God.  He's smacking me.  Hey, Twitchels have jumped to my favorite guest of the show.  He's jumped to your favorite guest of the show?  Yes.  He has jumped up to my favorite guest of the show.  Thank you, sir.  Cruel bastard.  This show just gets funnier and funnier.  We're on a fucking roll. 
[02:08:30]  Next road show, he's going to be a hit.  Holy shit.  Yep.  We really got to get a road show together now.  And you got to watch his act, too.  You can't just yell stuff.  I mean, you're the guy, as a comic, you got to watch what he does on stage.  He's a comedian.  He's not just a maniac.  He's going to relax.  All right.  Enjoy him.  Hey, we're going to take a break.  Speaking of comedians, we're going to get into the dice thing next.  All right.  The dice fucking soap opera.  Oh, so we're switching subjects?  Totally?  Why?  You said comedians.  We were talking about comedians.  And then we go to dice.  Huh? 
[02:09:00]  What?  What happened there?  Maybe we could have Big A do...  What happened now?  Maybe we could have Big A do Dice's act today.  Be getting more entertaining.  We can't hear half of it.  Dice has been trashing us.  We got some audio of it.  And we'll get into it next.  How's that sound?  Take off.  Oh.  I think that was an out cue, and I think somebody is in Dutch.  The point?  I didn't point.  You got a point?  He didn't point, but that was the out cue, and I understood that was the out cue. 
[02:09:30]  There was no point.  You got a point.  You know, in honor of the homeless shopping spree, which is going to be rerun tomorrow  because we're taking the day off, we'll do the Tippi Tom thing that Steve came up with.  How's that?  I love that one.  As we go to break, listen to this, and we'll continue.  From Stinko Records, it's the new collection of covers from America's favorite derelict.  I'm the original Golden Bum.  Tippi Tom, regurgitated.  Tom Jones.  It's not unusual to be in love.  He's drunk, smells like beef. 
[02:10:00]  It's not unusual.  And he's forgotten most of the lyrics.  Tippi Tom, regurgitated.  Chews up your favorite pop hits.  She's a lady.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  She's a lady.  And spews them back out.  Dirtier, grittier, and stinkier than farts and old beer.  But the lady is mine.  Or something like that.  From your favorite haunting melodies.  Riders on the Storm. 
[02:10:30]  Something like that.  To your most cherished classic rock cuts.  Come on, baby, let my fire.  Tippi Tom hunkers down and craps all over him.  And refuses to wipe.  Time to sit tonight on fire.  And if you act now, you'll receive Tippi Tom's tribute to the town he calls home.  I've been stuck on Frank Sinatra.  Start spreading the news.  It's old blue eyes.  I'm leaving today. 
[02:11:00]  Tippi Tom meets old crusty eyes.  I'm gonna be a part of it.  New York, New York.  It's a sappy salute to the city that broke his spirit, crushed his dreams, and left him blowing strange men for cheap wine in the Port Authority bus terminal.  If I can make it here, I can make it.  Tippi Tom.  Anywhere.  Regurgitated. 
[02:11:30]  It's up to you.  New York.  New York.  That's my vote.  Wrapped in a special carrying case.  Brown in the back.  Yellow in the front.  Just like Tom's underwear.  Call 1-800-NO-T-CELL right now for your copy of Tippi Tom.  Regurgitated.  Any more requests?  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh baby.  Oh baby.  Dirty little spank  It's a freak show  Dirty little spank  Oh yeah  This tastes so good  Come on down and I'll feed you a sausage  Give me an  Oh no  You guys suck

[02:13:30]  I know we're all coming up with things we should do with Twitchell  People hate the Outlaw Steak spot?  What's wrong with it?  Let's go to Krista on Long Island  Krista, what's up?  Hey guys, you know  You guys are really hysterical  But if I hear that stupid  Outlaw Steaks commercial 
[02:14:00]  That is so distorted  And horrifically produced  I'm going to throw my radio across the room  I've heard other things too  Now we love Outlaw Steakhouse  Love the steaks  They sent us  And we love doing the spots for them  I go into Steve's studio  All the time  And lay down copy  But for some reason  People are having a problem  With the way it sounds  And Steve is the guy that does it  Clipping like hell  You need a production engineer  Uh oh  Well Steve maybe  Steve is not too good with the equipment  So that might be what the problem is 
[02:14:30]  He's just  You know what else too?  He's sleepy  He's usually hibernating this time of year  Yeah, yeah, yeah  When it's snowy and cold  Oh wait, this is Krista the blind girl, right?  I knew he'd be marching in  Hey Steve  Oh, so her sense of hearing is much more acute  Than somebody with sight  Of course, right  She's the blind girl  Well, I'm also used to hearing my brother  Talk audio production all the time  Ooh  Ah  Basically, you're being called an incompetent  By a disabled person  You got a Ramone t-shirt now?  Look at his shirt  Ramone  Yeah, we're 
[02:15:00]  Ramone  Take this jerk off  How to mix sound  Ha, alright  Yeah, we have these  This is just a prototype  But, uh  Yeah, she's singing  Does it say something on the back?

Yeah, I think we moved it  I don't think it exists anymore  No, they erased it  Your name is Toby  All right, Chris, if only it was that funny  And the reason that commercial might clip  Is because they have to time out  To a certain thing  All right, well, Derek is finding Toby  Because Jimmy hasn't heard this yet  I've not heard it  This was the latest creation from Steve  Toby has a MySpace  And I didn't do it  It was some other person  He's trying to develop a new character  Called Toby  And it's Sam, our old intern  Voicing this  It's part of the action figure collection  That's right

Um, Sam  Just one second  The return of Sam, everyone  We love this guy  He's, uh, he's, uh, going to school in Syracuse  He's home for the break  He works on Scorch's show up there in Syracuse  And here he is  Sam  Hi, fellas  Toby was you?  Yeah  Yep  You know, Toby has gotten a lot of support  Somebody's even started a MySpace for Toby  The fans, the fans like Toby 
[02:18:00]  You know that means nothing  Yeah  The MySpace started for anything  How do you do?  I'm Sam  Hi, this is Sam  I thought Toby had legs  No  No  Toby doesn't have legs  You know, as I'm sitting here next to you  I really want you to die  I want to take my wine  My bottle of wine  Knock it over your head  Crack it over his head 
[02:18:30]  Just crack that across his teeth  It was so annoying  And it wasn't annoying, like, in a cute way  It wasn't annoying in a funny way  Or a memorable type way  It was just pure annoying  Like, like, like some kind of, like, feedback  Yeah  Like, if you're in a club when the band's soundchecking  And it goes  And you go like, fuck  It bends your neck  That type of annoying  Nothing  No redeeming quality 
[02:19:00]  It's like I want to hug you when you're doing the Toby voice  And just bite your shoulders and back  Oh  So it's back to the drawing board  Drawing board  Yeah  That's done  Not even workable  That's how bad it is  Wait, everyone's talking about something else, though  Paul in New York  Paul?  Oh, no  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey  Listen, uh  The same day that you ripped that stupid Toby bit apart  Yeah  Did you hear the, um  Oh, the response  What? 
[02:19:30]  Did you hear the bit that Steve recut for him?  No  Yeah, it was the response  It was the response  The day that you guys initially heard the Toby promo  And ripped it  And said, never play it again  Uh, Than and I went into the, uh  The other room  And cut a response  That was like a funeral dirge, almost  And that's  That's been running  Oh, okay  No, you only played it once, Steve  But it's a wise-ass response  Of course it is  All right, that's all I got  Well, you gotta understand  Steve is a notorious wise-acre  All right, Sam 
[02:20:00]  Thank you  Thank you  You're doing a great job  Yeah, good character work  Whatever you do  Character work  Fucking zilch  Dang, Toby  All right, we gotta get into the dice thing  I was gonna say  It's kind of disappointing  But I think, uh  No, it's par for the course  I think there's no surprise here, actually  We always  We always knew that Dice had a massive ego  And it was always about himself  Dice is, uh, two-faced 
[02:20:30]  Is what it is  If Dice walked in here right now  He'd be like  Nah, we're pals  I tell you  We're friends from way back  And then he goes somewhere else  And, you know, we're assholes  Or useless  Or, uh, off the radar  Or whatever the fuck  That's Dice  He's two-faced  No real friend  Does Dice have any real friends  In the business or anything?  It's people that know him  And people he's screwed over  And, uh, acquaintances 
[02:21:00]  That's it  Talks about broads  And how badly to treat them  As they just, you know  Fucking leave them  Eh  That's Dice  That's the real Dice  Well, in the old days  But thank God he's not hearing this  Because, uh, you know  We don't broadcast to anybody  Right?  Well, yeah  Well, that's what he's claiming  And, uh, he's gonna be very mistaken  Yeah  Very mistaken  We're gonna have a little  Pesta mission  Coming up  But, uh, that's disappointing in a way  Because Dice was kind of a friend of the show  When we were doing commercial radio 
[02:21:30]  Certainly was  Friend enough for us to, uh, get him back into Madison Square Garden  Because it sure as shit wasn't happening, uh, by himself  And he admitted that  He admitted that, uh, the power of our old radio show  We were able to get him into Madison Square Garden again  The guy has been to my apartment  I've been to his apartment  Because he had to rent one  Because he got kicked out of his house  That's why I don't go to any of these people's houses  I don't go there  I'm finally learning  Because stupid me  I really believe that  Some of these people that you hang out with  That they're really your friends  Like Jimmy Norton  And you realize 
[02:22:00]  You realize  There's no friends in this business  None  People, uh, you know  Turn their back on you  The first chance they get  It's not show friends  Anthony and I, uh  Jay Moore  When we all fell on our asses  Jerry Maguire  For the Sex with Sam thing  Yes  We found out who our real friends were  And there weren't many  None  There weren't many  A lot of people just, uh  Just turned, uh  Turned their backs on us  And walked away  And jumped on the next train  That was leaving  But isn't it nice  That there were some of us  That just stood in the station  Crying and waiting 
[02:22:30]  Right  For that train to come back around  Just waiting  Jimmy did  Rich Voss did  But it was out of desperation  More than love  Jay Moore was there for us  Yes he was  Hopped on the Colin Quinn Express  You did  Yeah, but why  Of all the fucking  Broken down vehicles to take  Where's Colin taking you?  Jesus Christ  That's jalopy  Ladies and gentlemen  Gonna be another delay  The Colin Quinn Express  Is experiencing  Mechanical difficulties  Again  Uh  We fell off the track again 
[02:23:00]  Oh I got a message  I gotta play from Colin  Not to get off this  That would just remind me  Of a good message of him  Alright  Apologizing to me  Stop it  I don't believe it exists  So, uh  You know  We had to wait about  Two plus years  To get back on the radio  And then we got back  On the radio  And people started  Coming around again  Coming around to  Congratulate us  And say  Hey it's great to have  You guys back  And they did the show  And they did that  And they called  And when can I come on  Blah blah blah  Then others  You know  Pretty much  Just blew us off  And Dice was one  Of those guys 
[02:23:30]  I'm sorry  But he blew us off  There's some people  That have  Gone on to the  Fucko list  That um  I didn't think  Would be there  Some people  Now I understood  When we were  Uh  When we were  Off the air  People had to do  What they have to do  Yeah  We always understood  That  It's like Hendry  Going to prison  You know  I understand  When you were in there  You had to do  What you had to do  But you're out  I don't want you  Fucking with that shit  I understand that  But now we're back  And stuff  And some  Certain people 
[02:24:00]  I want to say  Names  Lewis Black  Won't say the names  Yeah  Lewis Black  Has been a big  Disappointment  What a disappointment  That guy was on our show  All the time  He was on all the time  And it wasn't like  We had bad times  On the show  A lot of fun  Back and forth  We had a lot of  Good fun talk  About what was going on  In the political world  The fact is  He got much bigger  After we got fired  And he doesn't need us anymore  Doesn't need us  Doesn't want to fuck up 
[02:24:30]  But then there's guys  His career  By getting involved  With the likes of us  But that's bullshit  Because  Then you got someone  Like Dennis Leary  He doesn't need us  But he still does our show  Because he has a good time  He has a good time  He loves it  Rogan's a guy  Who's got a great career  Who just loves the show  Rogan doesn't have to do  The show ever  Loves doing it  But does it whenever he can  He has a self-destructive ass  Though too  Yeah he really is  He's a fucking sociopath  With a fucking BC hairdo  And he wants to just murder people  And bite them  Rogan's a fucking major problem  Bringing us the likes  Of Gangsta Fag 
[02:25:00]  Yeah exactly  To explain everything  Oh my god  Speaking of Gangsta Fag  We're all over the place  But I got an acoustic version  Of a Gangsta Fag song  We gotta play for everybody  Nice  A little later  You know  And quite frankly  Dice just never called us  He never called us  No never called  And then he came up  With some excuses  That he needed to talk to me  Personally about some stuff  And you know  How could I call him out on that  Because it was about  Well where was the fucking call  It was about my dad and stuff  Yeah where was the fucking call  I don't know  Yeah exactly  To be quite honest with you  I don't know  It was an excuse 
[02:25:30]  And you know  He could have called the show  Anytime to say  Hey welcome back to  You know  Radio guys  But he's another one of these guys  That doesn't believe in satellite radio  Which is crazy  Because Dice would be perfect  On satellite radio  Uncensored  Well what was satellite radio  Doing back in like 1986  Hmm  Let's see  The satellites weren't up  No one had even thought of it yet  I'm just trying to put you  In the mindset of Dice  And where he is 
[02:26:00]  Where his mind exists  1986  There ain't no satellite radio  It's all about him  His bedazzled jacket  And playing Vegas  That's it  Right  He has no clue  What satellite radio is about  Hold on a minute  Now we got some questions  Coming in  Pat in Boston  Pat  Hey boys  I just wanted to say  Let it all out  There are new listeners  Jumping on board  Every day  Oh there he goes  He just jumped 
[02:26:30]  Took a look out the window  Thank you  Charlie in Jersey  Charlie  Yeah I think the reason  Louis Blackjack  Doesn't talk to you guys anymore  Is because of the bus incident  No  After the bus  Even after the bus  He'd been on the show  Everything was fine  We had talked about it  Let me tell you something  About the  Voyeur bus incident  That got about  12 or 13 guys arrested  From this radio show  Look it up online  Because we don't have time  To get into that  All these guys spent  How many hours in jail?  27  We both smoked  27 hours  Jim Norton was in jail  With Louis Black 
[02:27:00]  I stayed in the office  Until everyone got out of jail  And Louis Black  Comes walking into the office  I'm sitting there  He comes walking in  Looking like shit  And I jumped up  And I said  Louis I am so sorry  That it went down this way  We never expected  People to get arrested  Blah blah blah  He turned to me  He goes  Sorry  Don't say sorry  You just made my career  See  That was an exact quote  From Louis Black  But then I guess  Since then he's kind of  You know  Changed his tune  He wrote a whole book  On his upbringing 
[02:27:30]  And stuff  Like an autobiography  Or whatever  And he doesn't even mention  The Voyeur bus incident  In this book  I talked to somebody  About that  And I didn't read  Louis' book  But somebody did say  That that was only part  Of his life  The first half of his life  And I could be wrong  But that was an explanation  Somebody gave me  That that did not cover  The second half of his life  I have a feeling that  People got to him  And said  Look man  You know  You got some respect  In this business  And you don't really need  To tell that story anymore  Even though it's one of  The greatest things  That has ever happened  To the guy  I think it's publicists  Or those type of people  Always keeping him off the show  When you start listening  To a publicist  They can help you 
[02:28:00]  But a lot of times  They're driven by the wrong things  You can't always listen  To a publicist  You know something  And he has been  On this new show  But he used to stop by  On the phone  He called once  He called once  Because we bitched  And complained  And he was in New York  And he's calling  From his apartment  And I'm like  What are you doing Louis  What happened to you  He called once  He used to stop by  We didn't even know  He was coming  He used to like  Walk from his apartment  And just kind of  Pop into the studio  And hang out  And that was fine  We had a great time with him  Right  And then all of a sudden  Now I don't know 
[02:28:30]  Like Jimmy says  Maybe it's his handlers  That need us anymore  I don't know  Where is he  But that's just one example  People don't know  How big Satellite's going to be  What's going to happen  Is a lot of the people  That don't want to be  A part of the show  Because they're like  Ah who's listening  All of a sudden  When they realize  Oh yeah  6 million subscriptions  Equals over 20 million  Yeah  Except I'm just saying  6 million by the end of the year  And seriously  What's 3 million  Or whatever  2 million  So that's  Times 2 and a half  It's like  It's 25-30 million people  Almost  There are certain  You know people  Yeah 
[02:29:00]  We're going to make  Everyone look silly  So Dice was on  A show in Philly  This is like  Beyond disappointing  I'm not even going to lie to you  Because you can hear  It's not even a bit  It's like  What are you doing Dice  You were in my apartment  When I went out to LA  I hung out with you  I mean  Why would you do this  You know  So we went on  Kid Chris' show  At WISP in Philly  I guess we're cool  With Kid Chris for now  Yeah  Because again  I talked to Chris  And we emailed back and forth  And stuff  He's like  Dude  I didn't  You know  Everything's good 
[02:29:30]  I want you to come on the show  A column the day before  The 30th was supposed to go on the show  So it's like  I guess it's all good man  I asked him  He's all good  Yeah Jimmy's playing  New Year's in Philly  At the Tower Theater  Tickets are on sale  Yeah go do Chris' show  The day before  So we got audio  I heard  That Dice was on  Kid Chris' show  And I heard that Dice was trashing us  So we  We tracked down the show  And got this tape  And it's unbelievable  It's ridiculous  Yeah  But you see  Now that you're on the east coast  Yep  Now that you're 
[02:30:00]  Now that you took it down to street level  And we're in Philly  We can talk cool again  That's right  You know what I mean  Before we had to put out a facade  You know you got all these guys  They're running to a  You know the cable  You know the  Whatever they are  See he's  He got all these  Got all these guys  Going to satellite radios  But he's going to try to make it  Like he has no idea  What it is  He's going to make believe  He didn't walk around XM  A few months back  Looking for a show  And XM wasn't interested  Yeah  Cable  So he's going to call it cable 
[02:30:30]  Like I don't know  That thing  They're jumping to cable  I don't know  What are they on  The Morse code  They're on the wireless  Or something  Yeah you dot dot  Dash  Dash  Listen to this  Shit  That comes out  Of his mouth now  All these guys  They're running to a  You know the cable  You know the  Whatever they are  You know they're in the  Cable box now  You know what I mean  So they can say  Four letter words 
[02:31:00]  Not my boy  Kid Chris  Okay  Kid Chris is sticking  With the  With the  With the real radio  Old school  The old school  Where millions of people  Are still tuning in  And going  You know what  I don't need to hear  The F word  To be friggin entertained  See how I just  They're friggin  What a dick  Yeah what the fuck  Is that all about  What a dick  You know the  F word  I don't like how  It might hurt  The children  What is it  The  The  The  Kinder gentler 
[02:31:30]  Dice  Of all people  The guy was dropping  The F bomb all the time  On the fucking air  By the way  By the way  Whenever he was on  It was just  Dump fucking city  They probably  Tell him beforehand  Dice  Please don't curse  We're gonna lose  The fucking license  Just don't curse  The freedom  That he was always  Like fighting for  I go on SNL  I was banned  Cause of what I said  MTV won't have me  Back on no more  And he's bashing 
[02:32:00]  A medium  That gives you  Complete freedom  Of fucking speech  What a dick bag  What a fucking  Dick bag  Reject from grease  Bedazzled  Leather jacket  Fuck cock  Go fuck yourself  Dice  Go fuck yourself  This is not a bit  No  You're just showing  Your true colors  What an ass  It's pathetic  You know all the help  We gave him  No one was caring  About Dice in this area  In the New York area  When we started  It started with  Anthony doing a great 
[02:32:30]  Dice impression  Making him believe  He was a jack  Yeah huh  And people really  Believed it was Dice  And then one of Dice's  People called  Dice  And Dice got a hold  Of the show  And we had a great  Relationship for a few years  And we sold out  Wherever he went  In the New York area  And trust me  He wasn't selling out  Before he started  Doing our show  And we made him  Very very funny  On the radio  That is a fact  Yeah put a new  Little edge on him  We knew how to  Work with him  And his silliness  Yeah  Cause all he'd want  To do is take over  So now he's trashing  And saying you know 
[02:33:00]  Satellite radio  All it is is about  Saying the F word  Saying curses  No it's not Dice  You fuck  He doesn't get it  I actually  When I was touring  With Andrew at the time  When I first heard  About you guys  I heard like this guy  Anthony did this  Impression of Dice  Who was my friend  And I was like  Fuck Anthony  I was like  Who are these douches  The name of the show  Is dumb  Opian  What assholes  And I listened one day  Driving to a gig  And I was like  Fucking howling  It really made me laugh  The first time  I actually got turned on  Look at that  And you were  Prejudiced against us  Oh I was so ready  To hate you too 
[02:33:30]  The name of the show  Stinks  But that's what I heard  Like the fucking  Opian  Who the fuck  Are these idiots  We're stuck with this  Stupid name  I still kind of feel  The same way  I know  Norton and Friends  Worked better  Norton and Friends  Is a fun name  Cause friends are involved  That's right  Norton  I like Norton  Jim Norton  And Friends  But that's how  I got turned on  Of you guys  He's a  What yes  Don't be so shy  You've got to  Raise his hand  Hurry  Didn't he thank you guys  On his album  The last one that came out  Yeah it was all about that  Face down ass up  But then you know 
[02:34:00]  He doesn't need us anymore  And he thought that we  Just didn't have much  Of a career left  So he's attempting  To start relationships  With other people  Other people  And turning our  You know  Turning his back on us  In the type of radio  That his hands  Are tied behind his back  He can't do anything  That he does on stage  He can't be the  Persona that he is  On stage  If he sat down  At that microphone  Over here  In this studio  He could go off  Like he's never been able  To go off 
[02:34:30]  On radio  And I believe  He would enjoy  Himself doing it  Right  But  Fuck it  It's an insult  To what we do  Because you know  Satellite is growing  It's so much more  Than just saying curses  Yeah  You get to speak your mind  You get to talk about  Adult subjects  In an adult way  And you're not a slave  To advertising  You don't have to  Break every 15 minutes  And you don't have to  Fucking worry about  Trashing a sponsor  Or something like that  And you know  And our audience  Is growing every day  All these critics  Out there  They're all just  Laughing and laughing 
[02:35:00]  At us  Well you just wait  To see what happens next  And we don't forget  Anything on this show  As they bash  Especially people  In the broadcast radio industry  They are in meetings  With the NAB  And the FCC  And everyone else  In meetings  Trying to put restrictions  On satellite radio  Right  That's what  They're constantly  Doing that  If they're so  If they're not worried  At all  Why put so much energy  In fighting this  Just let it go 
[02:35:30]  It's not going to  Amount to anything  Right  Yeah you guys  Are all preaching  That radio should be free  There you go  You got it  Alright  Shit is free too  You guys do the free radio  We'll do it this way  We'll see who wins  In the end  Let's say hi to Anthony  In New Jersey  Anthony  Yes Opie  Oh in Jersey  I thought you made  A crush from you  What's up Anthony  Guys you know  It's ironic  That you're talking  About Dice  Because I just  Recently discovered  This OAVirus.com  Yeah  Which is just  Absolutely tremendous  Whatever those guys  Whoever they are  But last night  I was listening 
[02:36:00]  To ONA  Doing the silent game  On Dice  From years ago  Which was just  Tremendous stuff  You know I'll tell you  I'm disappointed here  Because I always felt  Dice  And ONA  I mean you guys  He was a staple  On the NAW show  And I just think  Somebody's gotten to him  I don't even think  He probably has even  Ever listened to satellite radio  Nah he's completely  Out of touch  Is what it is  He's completely  Out of touch  As far as  You know  What satellite radio  Is about  What comedy is about  Completely out of touch  Too much history man  I hope you guys  Reconcile

[02:40:30]  There wasn't  Opie and Anthony  Anymore  You know what I mean  I'm telling you the truth  You know what I mean  The last I heard  They were in the desert  Looking for a job  Somewhere  I heard they opened up  A meat stand  Or something  You know  Like halfway to Vegas  There's like a little  Hot dog stand  Remember us  Those guys were nice to me  And I had no problem  With anybody  I'm not saying  I don't got no problem  I'm allowed to make fun  Of who I want  Yeah I know  I'm the king  You know what I mean  Yeah it's real believable 
[02:41:00]  It's real believable Dice  You're the king of what?  The king of the turncoats?  Your hot dog stand  What is it?  And he just goes off  On some  Is that what we're doing?  We have a hot dog stand  In the middle of the desert  By Vegas  All you critics out there  Just keep laughing and laughing  Enjoy  Enjoy it  As we rebuild this thing  Payback's gonna be a bitch  For all you  He gets weird man  Like you know 
[02:41:30]  You guys know how loyal  I was to him  And it's like  Absolutely  It was really difficult  Because you see a guy  You loved  And we had a whole thing  We didn't talk for two years  I mean just stop talking to me  Which was fine  I called him twice  And that was it  I'm not gonna go  We were off the air  And it turned out  It was about a bit  That he thought  I stole from him  What?  Are you shitting me?  And it wasn't a sex bit  Because he was an influence  In my career  I mean I loved him  But it was a Christopher Reeve bit  And I saw him at the comedy store  And I'm like dude  I've never stolen a bit in my life 
[02:42:00]  Ever  No  Ever  Actually let me tell you something  About Jimmy  Because I love comedy  And there's a lot of times  I go Jimmy  You ever hear Bill Hicks  Or this person  Or that person  And he's like  No no  I refuse to listen  Because he doesn't want to be  Influenced by other guys  For the most part  And I've watched enough comedy  In my life  And I've heard enough guys  Like you know  Hicks I have honestly  God never listened to  And I hear he's brilliant  I just don't want to be  Influenced  I don't want to know  But this was a Christopher Reeve bit  About Christopher Reeve  Going to the Oscars  And the bit I do  Or did  And I know it was mine  And I'm not saying  He took it 
[02:42:30]  He took it  Make fun of Christopher Reeve  So I'm at the comedy store  With him recently  I'm like  Alright what was your bit  He's like  I don't remember  I'm like  Well let's talk this out  Yeah  Line by line  What was the bit  And they were  Completely different bits  They both just mentioned  That Christopher Reeve  An award show  And the bits went  Completely the opposite direction  I'm like  Dude there's not  One line similar  It was like  We didn't talk for two years  Christopher Reeve  Is doing an award show  And I got my tongue  Up his ass  Oh  Now what was your bit  You're ripping me off 
[02:43:00]  Hoo hoo  Tell him Fred  Tell him  Hey jerk off  So I'm fucking  Christopher Reeve  And he's just  Laying there  With his legs  Dangling off the bed  And I'm pounding his ass  Geeze  Geeze  What's yours  What's your bit  Exactly the same  Right  Fucking ass 
[02:43:30]  Totally opposite bits  Dude  Of course  Totally opposite  Mine was about  I think they gave him  A standing ovation  And it was about  You know  The dumb bit  But him wearing a cape  It was stupid  But totally different  Yeah  I could see it  It was like a sex bit  Where he does a blowjob joke  I'm like oh fuck  You know  I was actually  Maybe  It was something  But I heard  And didn't realize  I heard  But that's just  Not the case  With that one  Alright well  Let's finish up  With this audio here  No problem  With anybody  I'm not saying  I don't got no problem 
[02:44:00]  I'm allowed to make fun  Of who I want  Yeah I know  I'm the king  You know what I mean  You know  When I'm halfway to Vegas  I'll stop at the hot dog stand  And say  You know  Put some relish on there  Hey  How come you  Did you  We're going to be  We're going to be  Serving Dice hot dogs  Here's the scenario  Dice's limo  Pulls up  On it's way to Vegas  In the middle of the desert  Because he's a big star  And we're nothing  You ever seen  Some of the roads out there  Just nothingness  But then on the horizon  There's a little glimmer 
[02:44:30]  And it's that chromium  Kind of hot dog stand  On the side of the road  And Dice goes  I'm a little hungry  And he pulls up  And who does he see  Working there  Me and you  Me and you  I'm back cooking them up  Because our careers  Are in the toilet  And you're in the front  Taking the money  And giving the cans  Of grape soda  And stuff  And you know  Asking people  If they want mustard  And relish  And stuff like that  And we serve Dice  He says thank you  And off he goes 
[02:45:00]  To his huge star  Stuttered life  In Vegas  And we're in the desert  Selling hot dogs  The end  He's brilliant  How about  He's fucking brilliant  We're here  Doing a radio show  That is getting  More popular  And more listeners  By the day  By the day  And you  Being mentioned  In papers  Almost on a daily basis  Now  All over America  Let's just say  We're doing fine  Doing fine 
[02:45:30]  In this business  And let's say  Dice  Is  Canceling shows  Because of lack  Of interest  In ticket sales  How's that for reality?  Let's not conjure up  This little scenario  Of a desert  Hot dog stand  And a trip  To Vegas  For Dice  What show did he  Have to cancel again?  He talks about  Some show  That had to be  Rescheduled  You know what that means?  No one's buying  Your fucking tickets  No one's buying  Your fucking tickets  That's what it means  That's what the 
[02:46:00]  Rescheduling is  Dice  In Vegas  I'll stop at the  Hot dog stand  And say  You know  Put some relish  On there  Hey  How come you  Canceled your show  Here in Atlantic City?  No I'm coming  To Atlantic City  I know  But what happened  To the one  On November 4th?  There was a  Miscommunication  Because I was  Doing a month  At the Luxor  In Vegas  Yeah it was  A miscommunication  Between  My tickets  The people  And their money

[02:52:00]  Walk into a bar  It's me and a friend  It's not even a joke here  Andrew Dice  Gay  Jack be nimble  Jack be quick  Whip it out  I'll suck that dick  Oh  So I'm online at the bank

[02:53:00]  I'm out of sight  Give you control  As you fall  Black as a bone  I'm out of sight  Give you control  Bow down before the one you serve  You're going to get what you deserve  Bow down before the one you serve  You're going to get what you deserve 
[02:53:30]  Fantastic  Fantastic  I said  I said  I gotta take a piss  And I'm just ready to get up  And Obie goes  Yeah I gotta piss too  So he leaves  And I hear the music kick in  I'm hoping it's some intro to a commercial  But  I hoped wrong  And now  No one's in here  Not even Jimmy  This would be me solo  Let's see  Pop down Bill  Bill in Vegas  Bill Vegas 
[02:54:00]  You're on the air  What do you got?  Hey I wanted to ask Jimmy a question  I'm curious  Why  Neither Voss  Nor Patrice  Nor Bob Kelly  Have ever punched his fucking lights out  Have ever punched Jimmy's lights out?  Yeah  Why would they do that?  Because of the way he provokes them  And talks about them  Yeah but they all provoke  And talk about each other like that  It's about being a comic  For some reason these guys  They have such low self esteem 
[02:54:30]  All of them do  That they have to beat up on somebody else  To make themselves feel better  So they do it to each other  And it's kind of an accepted thing  They will stick up for each other  Like Irish brothers though  They are like that  If someone else comes in  And tries to pick on them  Then they all like gang up on the one guy  And pile on  But like an Irish brother  You would never want to get between  The fight  This guy is saying  Why hasn't Voss, Patrice  Or any of the other guys 
[02:55:00]  Beaten the shit out of you  For the way you speak about them  Are you still here sir?  Yeah  What do you mean  Why haven't they beaten the shit out of me?  I'm not sure what you mean  Why haven't they punched your fucking lights out?  Because of the way you talk about them  We're all friends  We talk about each other that way  Yeah  Okay  That explains it all  I said it was because  You have such low self esteem  All of you  That you need somebody  To beat up on  And it's each other  And you accept that  Well the bottom line is  Like those guys  As much as we shit on each other 
[02:55:30]  They make me laugh harder  Yeah  Than anybody  So it's like  It's the way we all treat each other  It's the way we make each other laugh  But it's not for real  Like if Patrice  Came out and said like  Hey man  All kidding aside  I don't think Norton's funny  And he trapped me  It would hurt my feelings  More than it would make me angry  Right  If he shit on me  And called me a squishy worm  With no future  I would enjoy it  You gotta see these guys  At the back table  At the comedy cellar  It's brutal  You gotta have a thick skin  Oh no  These guys just kill each other  Voss is a retard  Patrice is a silverback  And besides 
[02:56:00]  Patrice doesn't put his hands on me  Because he knows  That you know  The white man you don't touch  You're probably  You're probably a lot tougher than me  I could have you shot for that  I could have had you shot for that  And Voss is just too dumb  To know someone's talking badly about him  He thinks it's a compliment  Because his name was mentioned  Alright  Alright thanks a lot  Thanks Bill  I'm not in charge of banning  From pal talk today  You should be  Somebody's IMing me  And saying  I was banned  But I wasn't doing anything wrong  Sir 
[02:56:30]  I am not reinstating you  I have relinquished command  You're not gonna  Pardon him?  No  I  Pardon you  You are not pardoned  He can't do that  Nope  I'm busy  I'm doing a show  I can't  Hey I would like some serious  Cereal  What kind of cereal is that?

[03:00:30]  So uh  Why is that?  If you pay close attention to the radio show  I've been pretty sick all week  Kind of the flu cold sore throat bullshit  That everyone else had  I finally got it  And uh  And everyone knows also  That I get like constipated at times  Where I go a few days without crapping right?  You better finish that cereal man  Eating here  So uh  So the boys  Have been uh  Taking that herbal supplement  Oh yeah  This is a big thing around here

Dude  No fart can go without that fast  And goes over there that fast  You smelled that awfully quickly  Unless Eric blasted one  And then walked out  Alright listen everybody  Please  And people wonder why I want a plastic bubble  Please listen  There's no way that that happened  Please listen  Please listen  Hold on a minute  Just don't wear fur  So what is this oxi powder about Steve? 
[03:02:00]  It's a  It's flame for the new listers  It's I guess it's a supplement  I don't think it's fiber  I wish I had the bottle in front of me  But it um  Let's go  It  Where?  No it's  Oh my god  Oh you dick  I can't fucking win  I  Anyway  It's uh  There's more caution for you  It puffs up  You take like six of them  At night  Yeah listen to this guy  Seriously  They recommend you take four  And if four doesn't 
[03:02:30]  Can you shut up Derek please  You take four of them at first  And if four doesn't work  You're supposed to take six of them  At night  Right  And only take them at night  Don't take them during the day  Because the results  Are catastrophic  What this stuff does to your problem  So explain what happens  It produces a lot of gas  And it puffs up your intestines  First of all  So like I don't really know  What the benefit to that would be  But it also prevents you  From absorbing water  So any water you drink  And you're supposed to take this stuff  With a lot of water 
[03:03:00]  Just goes right through you  Like a toilet snake  Right  And forces everything out  Into just liquid liquid excrement  In the morning right  In the morning  So you gotta time this out perfectly right  Yeah  Uh huh  So uh  And you have to take it for a week  So uh  Getting back to my thing  So you know  Everyone tells you  When you have a cold  That you should drink a lot of fluids  Right  Right  So I've been drinking a lot of fluids  Emergency  Orange juice  You have it okay  And I haven't taken a crap 
[03:03:30]  In a couple days  Yeah  What are you doing Jimmy  Go ahead  You need attention  No  I'll wait  Go ahead finish  I'll wait  No that's not what I was doing  What are you doing  Nothing  Go  Now I'm not talking  No but I'm listening  I'm trying to eat so fast  Jimmy's trying to show me a snot rag  And I'm getting distracted  No I wasn't trying to show you my snot rag  No I wasn't  Who were you showing it to then  Why do you think  I was trying to show Anthony my snot rag  While you  Fucking took his mouth 
[03:04:00]  I ain't fucking looking at your snot rag  I had a nice one on there too  I'm on to you  Just gonna pause and tell your story after  It would have been nice just to watch  I got distracted  Well I wasn't showing you  And what I'm about to say  Will fuck up his meal  Oh my god  You know how much  What  I never eat in this studio  Right  And every time I try  You motherfuckers  Talk about disgusting shit  So listen  Or perhaps the show  Is just all disgusting shit  So Steve has been using this product  Derek used this product I think  No  One time Derek used it  And his results were so ridiculous 
[03:04:30]  He said never again  I think Danny used this product  So I haven't taken a crap in a couple days  And I'm drinking all this fluid for my cold  And I'm like man  I gotta get rid of what's inside me  So you gave me the bottle of stuff  Oxi powder  Yeah  It's like  I don't know  Maybe 90 pills in this thing  So I took five last night  Okay  Five  And I took it early  Because I crashed early  Because I just wanted to get some sleep  Right  So I wake up this morning  At 3.30  And I'm rolling around  And also I'm like  I feel a fart coming on 
[03:05:00]  I'm like  It's no big deal  Oh no  Okay hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Wait a minute  Not long  Hold on  Stretch  Stretch  So  It's 3.30  3.30 in the morning  And I'm on some cold medicine  So I'm like  Kind of waking up  And trying to figure it all out  But I'm a little dazed and confused  What were you trying to figure out 
[03:05:30]  And how  I'm figuring out what time it is  I'm like  Oh I gotta fart  Maybe I can get some more sleep  What time was it  Like 3.30 in the morning  3.30  That is fucking early  And you have kind of a  Puffy feeling almost  Puffy feeling  I feel this fart coming on  I'm like  It's no big deal  Oh my god  It's just a fart  Right  So I decide  Alright I'm just gonna let it go  Cause I'm  Sure  You know  I wanna get back to sleep  Yeah  Yeah I should  Were you alone  Oh yeah  Was anybody  Was anybody with you  In the room  I was alone  I was alone  I try to fart when I'm alone  3 o'clock 
[03:06:00]  3.30  What time did you get to sleep  That made you wake up so early  It's not 8.30  It's a quarter to nine  Oh my god  Please  So  So I decide  That I'm gonna let a little fart out  And  Right  Yes  I shit my pants  Oh god  You can't have shit your pants  I swear to god  Liquid shit  Oh Jesus Christ  Wow  As in  As in my pajama bottoms  Had to be wrapped up  In plastic bags 
[03:06:30]  And thrown out  You motherfucker  Was it that violent  Dude  It was ridiculous  The next thing you know  I'm in the shower  3.40 in the morning  Scrubbing  Scrubbing shit  From like  The back of my thighs  And the back of my knees  Oh my god  Your bathroom  Is not that far away  From your  From your bedroom  Like you couldn't  Get up  The shower's upstairs  I had to go  I had to waddle  To the bathroom  You didn't feel it  Like as you would  Dude it was 3.30  I was thinking  It was a fart  I haven't taken this shit  I didn't know that  It comes out like that 
[03:07:00]  It's pretty  Pretty explosive  I sprayed myself dude  I sprayed myself  And I had to hold  The bottom of my  Pajama legs  Close  As I'm walking  Up the stairs  To the fucking shower  It does say  On the bottle  Produces loose  Loose bowel movements  I understand that dude  At 3.30 in the morning  When you think  You can just sneak out a fart  I can understand  If you're awake  And you're starting to feel  That you have to go to the bathroom  You go to the bathroom  You filled up your pant leg  It was 
[03:07:30]  Ridiculous  All came out didn't it  Wow  Pesta milk  That's bad  He's going to throw it at me  No  Jesus  That's a bowl of blueberries  It's blueberries  Blueberries  That's what happens  When you eat a lot of protein  A lot of high protein  It gets all bound up  And it's just  Especially if you don't go for a while  You've got to take this stuff  That stuff should be illegal  It's great  It should be illegal  I took it for a week  I have never had more natural sleep 
[03:08:00]  After taking this stuff  Because I eat a lot of egg whites  You're still using it?  I do it like for a week at a clip  Why doesn't Derek tell his story?  Because he told his story in the office  Oh boy  Derek is rarely on the show  Derek doesn't like being on the air really  And Danny also has stopped taking this stuff right?  Where's Danny?  Derek tell your story  Yeah well  I took it on like a Friday night  Look at this  This is like confessions  Yeah  I took it on a Friday night 
[03:08:30]  I remember it well  Hi my name's Derek  And I've also shit my pants  Let's just say  I didn't go out for the rest of the weekend  Pretty much  Really?  The whole weekend  The whole weekend  And I only took it once  I took five I think  And I didn't go out for the entire weekend  And it's supposed to clean your whole fucking system out  Yeah it's supposed to clean it  You're supposed to drink a lot of water  And you're just supposed to shit  Like all weekend long  And every time I felt a fucking fart coming on  I had to cup my hand underneath  Underneath my ass  Because you literally 
[03:09:00]  You can't sneak out a fart  You have to shit  See I didn't know that when I woke up at 3.30 this morning  I'm thinking this is like any other morning  A quick fart  Who's looking?  Yeah and I was expecting  Who's fucking looking?  And I was expecting to go like just once  And get everything out  I shit like 12 times in one day  And not just like big shits  Little painful shits that burn your asshole  This stuff sounds fantastic  It is  What an endorsement  So you tried it one day 
[03:09:30]  That was it  I tried it once and that's it  And Danny  Also has shit his pants  Is he talking about the oxy powder?  Yeah  Oh you weren't listening?  Are you still on it?  Uh no I used it for about a week  And I feel so  I feel exponentially better  Did you shoot your pants off?  You had a really hard time for a ride  No I didn't  Actually the story that I had wanted to tell  Was about my father as a matter of fact  So I hope he's listening  Uh my dad's like naked guy  He's the guy that like hangs out in the house  Just totally naked  No underpants anything  He'll walk around  He doesn't give a shit  So he's hanging out with his wife  And they're watching TV 
[03:10:00]  And he felt what he thought  Was a fart coming on  So just to be goofy  He's on the couch  And he swings his legs  Like up to his  Up to his head more or less  And tries to squeak one out  But instead of it being  You know air  It turns out that it was in fact  Liquid  And he just made a nice little arc  Of liquid poofies  On the carpet  And then him and his wife  Had to run and get you know towels 
[03:10:30]  And clean it up  There you go pops  That's great  Oh wow  There's oxy powder though  There should be a warning on the label  That says that you will have the bowels  Of an 80 year old woman  What is Nathaniel writing?  Because that line wasn't that funny  It says tubdad.com  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Tubdad  Wow  You know even without the arcing  Of the liquid shit  That story he just told 
[03:11:00]  Is frightening  Like on it's own  Without the shit  You guys have been taking  And everything  What is his dad doing naked  Putting his feet up in the air  And farting on the couch  Whose father does that?  Danny?  Danny what  Yeah  Explain further  Honestly I can't  Because that's the way it's been  Ever since I was a kid  He was just always  You know naked guy  He just did not give a shit  About walking around the house 
[03:11:30]  Just totally naked  He had never a problem  That's really odd  What did your mom think?  She never said much  No?  No  Was he naked too?  No  No she never did that  She never walked around like that  What about like after school  If friends were coming over?  Well I'd have to  You know I'd have to be like  Wait here  You know and he'd let  You know he'd let me in  And I'd have to tell him  Dad you know I got somebody here  So he'd have to run and go  But he wouldn't even put clothes on  He would just put on a pair of  Tidy whities  Like constantly  Walking around the house  All day  That is really  When he was home  Yeah 
[03:12:00]  That's what he did  Really odd  You do understand  Your father's an exhibitionist  Don't you?  Yes I do  I do  Yes I do  Yes I do  I tried to  I wanted him to call in  But he was too busy  So  Doing what?  Standing in front of  A schoolyard?  Yeah  Showing his genitals  To children  With an open robe  Lovely  Showing his legs over his head  Arking  That's horrible  When you were sleeping  Did you ever hear someone  Poked their head in your room  And go  Psst  Look how big it is  Kid  All right

[03:15:00]  There is a little bit  Of an embarrassing story  About Danny  Oh  When he was  Yeah when he was  Six years old  We took him to  California's Disneyland  Yes  And the big ride  At the time  Was Star Tours  Based on Star Wars  Yes the little  Virtual reality thing  They show a kind of  A film  Of a video  On the front screen  And the thing moves  And you really get  The feeling of motion  Sure  Like one of those  Hydraulic 3D rides  Yeah  So Danny was 
[03:15:30]  Strapped in tight  And he was  Enjoying the film  And afterwards  We noticed  A pungent odor  Oh no  Permeating the little  Booth there  And quite frankly  He had shit his pants  Yeah but Pop  Do you remember  Do you remember  Why I shit my pants  I was imagining  Because of the  Excitement of the ride  No no  It was because  That this fucking line  For Star Tours  Was two and a half  Hours long  And me being  A six year old  Had to take a dump  And these fucking  Parents of mine 
[03:16:00]  Wouldn't get off  The fucking line  To let their son  Take a shit  Well you know  You really  You never voiced that  To us  You never let us know  So we were assuming  That you shit  Because of the ride  No you fucks  Wouldn't get off the line  Because you didn't want  To have to wait  On it again  No we've been on this line  For 40 minutes  And there was still  Another hour and 40  Left to go  So instead of  Bringing their son  To the shitter  They let their son  Shit his pants  On Star Tours  Well you know  After we dragged you  To one of those restrooms  I remember  To have a changing table 
[03:16:30]  And I slowly  Had to peel off  You know  Your shitty underwear  There was no way  I was going to clean  There was no way  I was going to clean  It and put it back  On you  So you know  I had to deposit it  In the garbage  And then clean you  Off as best as possible  Little kid going commando  Went around without underwear  Sweet  Yeah I know that  Believe me  That's one of the memories  I will always treasure  One of those Disney memories  Yeah those  Those don't go away  When you wish a  Pfft  I just don't remember 
[03:17:00]  Pooping for distance  On the couch  I just don't remember  Oh you told me  Talk to Donna  I'm sure she remembers  Because she said  She had to clean it up  Oh my god  Well you know  There were many years  That I was in a blackout  You know  But we're okay now  Everything's fine now though  Huh  Oh absolutely  I'm working at  MyRadioStore.com  Pumping out those  XM radios for Ziggy  And the crowd  My dad's plucking 
[03:17:30]  Nice  Your dad works  At MyRadioStore.com  He got into a little mess  And I had to  Help  I had to clean  I had to clean your ass  This time daddy  My daddy shit his pants  And I cleaned them up  I'm very proud  I'm very proud  Of my son Daniel  Hey what's the  What's the naked  Guy deal  You know  I got that from my dad  Because he would  Always walk around  You know  With this huge package  Swinging around  When I was growing up  Some line I come from 
[03:18:00]  Huh  Apparently it skipped a generation  Yeah  Yeah  Danny was a little more modest  When it came to that  Oh absolutely  Yeah  Danny's got the  Dunky Dong  So  Holy shit  Are you packing Danny?  Mate  Well you  Come on you guys  Saw it  No  Wow  Okay  What  So you saw your father  Walking around like that  And just assumed  Did you do it ever since 
[03:18:30]  You were a kid or  Well yeah  Ever since I was a kid  Dad always walked around naked  And so I thought  There was nothing wrong with it  You know  At least when there was  Nobody else in the house  But the family  But the family  Yeah  Maybe some members of the family  Might not be comfortable  Seeing that  I know if my father  Was walking around  Well I'd scream in horror  Because he's been dead  For about ten years  But if he was walking around  When he was alive  And he was naked  Forget about it  He tried once  Like me and my brother  Would take baths 
[03:19:00]  We were kids  Like I don't know  Five  Six  Around there  And he decided  That baths  You know  Were for kids  And it was time  For us to be men  So it was time  To teach us  How to take a shower  So the three of us  Get in the shower  Naked?  Of course  And he's teaching  You know  He's teaching us  How to you know  Not slip in the shower  And how to wash  In the shower  And stuff like that  How to wash  The underside  Of the ball bag  By demonstrating  You know  On himself  He's washing his arms 
[03:19:30]  And stuff like that  So he turns around  And like to a kid  That fucking dick  Is like ten feet long  You know  Because you're used to just  You know  Your little kid dick  And then you're seeing this  It's like ten feet long  And now the water  From the shower  Is coming off of him  And you know how  It'll run off  The tip of your dick  So I'm assuming  He's taking a piss  And I'm like  Stop  Stop peeing  Stop peeing  He's like  I'm not peeing  It was a disaster 
[03:20:00]  I'm crying  I'm like  Stop peeing  And meanwhile  It would have been  Like a five minute piss  That he's taken  But the way the water  Was coming off  Of his huge junk  And all I remember  Is like  Giant snuffleupagus  Size junk  And black  Fucking hair  Everywhere  It was a nightmare  And that sticks out  In my mind  Did he teach you  How not to slip  In the shower  Grab a hold of this  With both hands  Could have done  Chin ups on it  I do remember  Showering with my dad 
[03:20:30]  Probably until  I was like  Ten or eleven years old  I don't know  Whether it was  A depression mentality  To save water  Or to save time  But we would shower  That's not what it was  No  You left out  A few other options  There that it could have been  Sir  That may be option A  Yeah there's no need  To be showering  With the children  No  Figure it out  Ourselves  Thank you  I haven't showered  With Danny  In quite a while  Well you ought to  We do it here  At the studio  And it's very enjoyable  For the holidays  We'll get together  And reminisce about all times 
[03:21:00]  Me and you  Paint each other up  Alright  We'll do that real soon  Alright Dave  Well Dave  Danny's dad  Very entertaining  Thank you for the call  But they're telling us  Great job  You gotta go  Yeah you definitely  Gotta go  Thanks a lot man  Bye bye  Punch it out  Danny  Punch it out  Oh it's Dave  It's Dave  I don't remember  You stink  I don't want to do it  To his dad  How old is your pop  Oh jeez  About  I guess he's 47  47  So it's not like 
[03:21:30]  Hippie mentality really  It's just kind of like  Grown up in the  It was normal to him  Early 70s  You know  Like  Yeah it could be  A hippie mentality  Late in the hippie game  Yeah he reminds me  Of a certain 70s dad  Of a boy named Danny  Very willful  Young boy  That's great  Naked pop  Yeah  That's terrific  He sounds like a fun guy though  Has he got a good sense of humor  Oh he's great  Yeah  No he's definitely a fun guy 
[03:22:00]  Especially now that he doesn't smoke pot  Or get ridiculously drunk  He's great  He had to do that  There's so many of these fathers  That reach that age  Late 40s  Like early 50s  And stuff  That realize now is the time to clean up  After their kids are all out on their own now  Where they can support themselves  It's like thanks for  You know  Choosing now  To fucking not be hammered  Or on drugs  Not when I was growing up  And really  Kind of needed some  And really needed  Guidance 
[03:22:30]  Or you know  My father just  Pounded  Beer  All day long  I'm talking from the time he woke up  Till the time he went to sleep  It was just drinking  Quartz of Budweiser  Drinking  And then at night  It was shots and stuff  And I mean hammered  And we would go driving  For the people that are living  In Southern California  There's something called  The Ortega Highway  It goes from  Like Capistrano  Where we live  Kind of close enough  To the coast  Inland  To Lake Elsinore 
[03:23:00]  It is a road  That is horrific  To drive  Under ideal circumstances  Cliffs  No guardrails  Just horrible  And we used to drive  On that road  In this old rickety  Pick up truck  With him  Hammered  Drunk off his ass  And it was a white knuckle  Ride for me  For years  I just remember  Alright let's  Trailer up the horses  With a horse trailer  Toe on a horse trailer  Trailer up the horses  Where are we going? 
[03:23:30]  Going Elsinore  Holy shit  Not the Ortega Highway  Not the fucking Ortega  And you'd get over  A crest of a hill  Where you'd see  Elsinore in a valley  And no  Now  It's complete downhill  Windy fucking road  And he's like  Beer between his legs  Drinking  All drunk  And I'm just watching  The wheels  Kind of over the double yellow  Kind of to the  Side of the road  The guard rail  On the mountain side  Getting close  Horrifying  And then you know 
[03:24:00]  I went out there  Probably in 86  To hang out with me  A bunch of friends  Went out there  And he's drinking  Orange soda  Yeah now the doctor  Tells me  You know the liver  Is a little bit  Thanks a lot  The orange soda  Could have been good  Down to fucking Ortega  Instead of me  Clinching the fucking  Door handle  And my knee  Unbelievable  They do this  And you wonder  Why I'm fucking neurotic  My dad for the longest time 
[03:24:30]  Couldn't find a career  So during his early days  When I was  When I was a toddler  He used to work  At fast food joints  And he was broke  Of course  And we had a tiny  Little garden apartment  In Whitestone  And he would  Want to get drunk  And he had no cash  To do it  So he'd bring home  Buckets of chicken  And bring it to the bar  And barter with the guy  For pieces of chicken  Chicken for drinks  Chicken for drinks  Holy shit  Alright  My pop  Again  It was one of those deals  Where every other week  He seemed to have  A new career  And one of his careers  Was vending machines 
[03:25:00]  He would do maintenance  And collect the money  Out of the vending machines  For the longest time  We would go to the store  And all I would see  Is him paying for shit  With quarters  Like he's just  Pilfering from the vending machines  And you know  There we are  He's at the bar  A lot of times  He'd pick me up  From somewhere  Whether it's school  Or I don't even remember  And we'd end up  At a bar  Somewhere in like  Mineola  With sawdust  And peanut shells  On the floor  And there he is  With a ten dollar 
[03:25:30]  Roll of quarters  Boom  Shot in a beer  Shot in a beer  And I'm just sitting there  You know  Another coke for the kid  It was just growing up  Like that  Tragic  Oh it was awful  Absolutely tragic  Well Danny thanks  You're welcome  Fond memories  Good times  Get Danny  A raise  He needs it  Alright we'll take a break  Want to do the news  With Twitchels and Big A  When we get back  Yeah we could  Finish up with a few  Of their stories  We got the acoustic
