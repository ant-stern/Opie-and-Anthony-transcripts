<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast began with a graphic discussion of an HBO special depicting sex work in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx.  The hosts and a caller, Billy, provided explicit details of the sexual acts depicted. This was followed by a call-in segment with NYPD Officer Keith, who recounted his experiences with undercover work involving prostitution and male sex work, offering highly detailed and explicit accounts, including audio recordings of his interactions.

The show then transitioned to an in-studio interview with professional wrestler The Iron Sheik.  The conversation covered his career, experiences in Iran and the US, incidents at airports post-9/11, and his overall life. A listener's personal ad from the *Improper Bostonian* criticizing the show was also read and discussed. Comedian Rich Voss, a guest, promoted his upcoming VH1 pilot, "The Unhappy Hour," and shared explicit anecdotes involving himself and Jim Norton. This led to a lengthy, sexually graphic recounting of various encounters by Voss and Norton, filled with crude and offensive jokes and personal insults between the two comedians.  A caller identified Voss from his appearance on MTV's *Loveline*.  This segment also included a surprisingly awkward and antagonistic phone interview with Ruth Buzzi, with the hosts making offensive comments about her appearance and career.  The segment concluded with a discussion of newly released Richard Nixon tapes containing bigoted and offensive remarks, with the hosts reading excerpts and adding their own commentary.  The discussion then circled back to Ruth Buzzi and the "Has-Been Hall of Fame."

The following segment began with a recap of a painful interview, followed by a critique of the movie *Hurricane Carter*, which the hosts compared to a Scooby-Doo episode.  The majority of the segment featured an in-studio interview with the "Mini Wheat guy," Jeff Norris.  The conversation covered his career, salary, and a graphic description of a physical altercation with his girlfriend's brother.  Norris also discussed upcoming appearances at the U.S. Comedy Festival and *Saturday Night Live*.  Throughout the interview, Opie and Anthony frequently interrupted with crude jokes.  Near the end, a recorded message from Norris expressing his gratitude was played, followed by further banter and crude jokes.  The segment concluded with plans for the hosts to appear on Jay Moore's *More Sports* show, discussing increasingly outlandish ideas for a skit involving a massage, including homoerotic humor. Jay Moore himself called in to discuss these ideas further, before the show wrapped up with a brief discussion of other upcoming appearances and final banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  There's nowhere to go. That's like saying you don't like Earth, you're leaving.  Where are you going?  Opie and Anthony.  And we finally have control.  Yes.  Gets better every day, don't it?  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show?  Uh-huh.  So we should talk about the HBO special, finally.  Yeah, this is great.  Right, HBO rules.  Billy, are you still there? 
[00:00:30]  What's up, man?  Sorry to make your way. What's going down, man?  Nothing, but you've got to admit, HBO rocks, man.  You like the hooker special that was on last night?  Oh, is that great, man?  The best was the guy reaching for the balloon knot, you know?  Well, HBO knows how to do this stuff.  They're pros at this.  They have fooled people into believing that these are expos√©s,  and they're done with journalistic integrity.  Documentaries.  Documentary style.  This is nothing more than getting porno and lewd acts on television, and I love it. 
[00:01:00]  And you know something, HBO, they're allowed to show any of that.  You know, they could show this stuff.  Usually, they don't show rated X movies.  You can't see that on HBO.  But you could catch the occasional boob and full frontal nudity in the movies they play on HBO.  But this is a whole new level.  This is hookers and Johns having sex.  Real people.  Real down and dirty, filthy, smelly language. 
[00:01:30]  It's Hunt's Point, Anthony.  Hunt's Point.  I said Hunt's Point.  Hunt.  Hunt.  I want to go there.  It's in the Bronx.  It's in the Bronx?  Yeah.  Named after a Michael Hunt.  As a matter of fact.  They called him Mike for short.  Oh, that's Mike's town.  Right.  Good old Mike.  And the hookers there, apparently, they have been chased out of there.  Well, they were chased to there.  From Manhattan.  From Manhattan.  Because they're running rampant.  Who was the chick showing off her oral technique for about 30 to 40 seconds? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Car after car after car.  There was one girl at the end of the special.  Doing it as she's standing up?  Yeah.  She was the one with the, like she had little blonde curls or something.  Yeah.  On the front of her hair.  Like one of those bobblehead dolls you get at like a hockey game.  Her head motion was so fast, it was like a woodpecker's head on a tree.  Shirley Temple hair.  Yeah.  She had Shirley Temple hair.  And they showed her in various situations.  One, it was through a car window.  Because they videotaped, I guess.  Well, they used a hidden camera. 
[00:02:30]  And they'd show these girls walking up to the cars.  They'd fuzz out the license plate.  But that's it.  That's it.  So if you ever saw a car, you know, hey, that Nissan looks familiar with the little dent over there or something.  It was pretty much giving these guys up.  With the My Kids and Honor student bumper sticker.  They showed one shot.  It was a silhouette.  Like just the black outline of the shadows.  And you could see the junk in hand.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that was the whole montage they did of her technique.  It was great. 
[00:03:00]  And they showed through the window.  Oh, her head's just going.  She looked like she was a robin trying to get a worm out of the ground.  A worm out of the ground.  Trying to pull that worm out of the ground.  Like trying to get one of those worms out of like a frozen ground, Anthony.  Yeah.  And he's holding on for dear life.  Robin's got to eat.  Right.  And they showed her head bobbing up and down through the car window.  Then they show her the guys leaning up against the brick wall.  And she's like bent over kind of sideways.  Yeah.  A little sideways.  Wham, wham, wham, wham, wham. 
[00:03:30]  Just going to town.  I think she's going to need a chiropractor.  Yeah.  That could hurt her back.  The best part of the special last night was the guy.  I guess he was getting soul worked up.  Sounded like he was a big ass mother effer too.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, you know, the whole confrontation started off with, you know, how can I explain this?  Yeah, it's kind of tough to explain what was going on.  Just being very macho to the hooker.  And by the end of it, she had something going on with this guy where he's admitting everything. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Things he wants to do to other men.  As she is doing things to him manually and orally, she's doing things.  He asked her to roll a condom onto her finger and then use that on him.  Yep.  And as she's doing that, he's yelling, oh, my God, I want to.  And then he was talking about satisfy other men. 
[00:04:30]  He's using terminology.  Not other men.  Her man.  Yeah, yeah.  Whether, you know, who knows who her man is.  Oh, I want to suck on this.  And I want to touch and, you know, jumble these around.  And he's getting into graphic detail.  And tussle that.  Tussle that little thing.  Give a little tickle to that.  Right.  You know.  A little rub and a tug here.  A little nuzzle here.  A little nuzzle.  It's like, oh, yes, dude.  And he asked her.  Jesus.  And he's screaming this.  And then he asks her to put her lower, her bottom. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Right against him.  Yeah.  So he couldn't breathe.  Yeah.  Dude, that's a nice request.  That's the only one I really liked.  But, but, no, as he's doing this, he wanted to do this.  And he was telling her this because he wanted to imagine that it was her man.  Oh, yeah.  And that he was actually going to do things to yams as they hung down.  The sniffing is nice, though. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, God.  It's a, Norton, it's a hooker.  Well, what?  She's out of feelings.  It's a hooker, for God's sake.  So she should not be allowed to vote?  Disgusting.  That's not.  They've got morals, too.  We learn what they will and won't do.  Right.  Keith the Cop has some great, oh, yeah.  Well, I heard a couple of stories, thanks to Ben.  I heard a couple of stories about what Keith used to have to do.  Now, where was this, Keith?  This was, we'll say, someplace in the city.  Okay.  Let's just say someplace in the city. 
[00:06:00]  You actually had to go out on hooker detail?  Yeah.  I've gone out on hooker detail a few times.  Now, why don't you explain your hooker detail?  Yeah, because I would think, now, just hearing that, I would think, like, I've watched on an episode of Cops.  Here's an officer, along with other officers, in maybe a hotel room.  Right next door is another hotel room.  The girl cop is dressed like a hooker.  She goes out, gets a guy, brings him into the room.  They negotiate the price.  He says some phrase.  She goes, okay, come on in. 
[00:06:30]  And the cops bust in and grab the guy.  Now, Keith, that must be what you mean by a hooker detail, right?  Well, no, I've actually never done hooker detail like that.  No, no?  Then, my goodness, whatever do you mean?  We've done some street hooker detail.  Oh, yeah?  Like, you're making believe you're a John there?  Or a pimp or something?  Well, yeah.  We do things like that sometimes.  Well, if it wasn't a pimp or a John, I can't imagine what else they would have to have you portray. 
[00:07:00]  Well, there are certain areas where, let's say that...  Wait, Keith, let me visualize.  So, you make believe you're a married guy from Jersey.  You're coming into the city for a little tale.  There's the hot female hookers.  Right.  And you pull up, and then what happens?  Well, some places, they're not necessarily women, as little Jimmy might know.  You betcha.  Oh, my God.  And, you know, there is occasion. 
[00:07:30]  And let me tell you something.  Yes.  The guys that are coming in from out of town, it doesn't matter how hot that this person might be.  Yeah.  They know.  They know that they're guys.  Yeah, and you'll get the guys with the car seats and the back seat, and, you know...  Oh, so, like, they got their family vehicle where they might take their young child to go get some ice cream.  Well, Keith, don't they have to get you saying something sexual for money or something?  Because I'm really...  I'm vague.  I never discuss anything, and if somebody wants to go for... 
[00:08:00]  I just say, hey, you want to come for a ride?  And they're like, what do you want?  I'm like, ah, just if you want to come for a ride, I will never say anything until they're in the car.  Little Jimmy, haven't we had this discussion before about what to say and what not to say?  It's not about you, douchebag.  Well, it's not...  It's about educating people out there who may want to...  I'm not the only guy in the world.  No, you're using our radio show to get info so you don't get freaking arrested.  Hold Keith on your own goddamn time.  I want to ask Keith this, though.  Okay.  Yeah, well, this is a much better story that he's about to tell here.  Well...  Keith cruises for guys, dude.  So, Keith, you have to dress up as a hooker. 
[00:08:30]  No, no.  Well, what happened was there are locations where...  Dude, tell me you drive up undercover trying to pick up other dudes.  Please tell me.  Yeah, I have done that.  Boy, how come that isn't on the NYPD promotion for recruits tape I've seen at the movie theaters and on television?  They have you dressed up like a hooker.  No, we don't dress up like...  He doesn't dress up like...  Not dress up like...  He's the guy in the car picking up friends. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, wait.  Are you the guy...  No, wait a minute.  Not even trainees, dude.  Hold on.  I would almost give that one to you.  You're talking about just regular male...  Okay, wait, wait, wait.  We're confusing so many stories together.  Hold on, hold on.  If I'm confused, the listeners are going to be...  Keith, Keith.  We're confusing too many stories together.  Are you posing as the person looking to get money for sex or the person looking to pay for money?  I have done both.  Okay, so he has been the guy. 
[00:09:30]  You have been the guy?  Now, how do you dress like a young cruiser out there looking...  Well, when you're cruising in a car, you're just in a car.  Yeah, but how do you dress like a young stud hustler from the street?  Standing on the street corner.  Do you leave your underpants at home?  No, no, no.  Do you have Dustin Hoffman cut your handlers?  There are certain locations where it's just like regular dudes just standing out there.  Yeah, then what happens?  Do you pack a pickle?  Well, you know what?  I happen to have been standing there one time.  I've actually only done this once.  Yeah.  Once is...  Once was more than enough. 
[00:10:00]  Exactly.  I agree.  Like, you get talked into these things because nobody else wants to do it.  And, you know, you want to be a team player.  And the popular GM of a radio station pulls up.  Says it's Ken Stevens.  Because he's had a tough week.  He's had a tough week.  I figured, what the hell?  Huh, you're cute.  And so I happen to be standing out there.  And it's very slow moving.  But finally, this dude comes up and...  Does he get butterflies?  Like, ooh, this one likes me.  Or does he start feeling fat when they just drove past? 
[00:10:30]  You know, you feel very unwanted.  You're like, oh, what's wrong with me, right?  Hey, you son of a bitch.  I'm hot.  You got rejected by freaking husbands and bastards.  So this guy comes walking up to me and, you know, he asks me how much.  Oh, no.  For what, Keith?  Did he say for what?  Well, you know, and I happen to, you know, I...  Now, you've got to do your job.  You've got to ask him the right questions.  I told him for an oral treat. 
[00:11:00]  It would be $25.  You cheap man!  Now, Keith, that's some self-esteem.  Really, dude?  That'd be worth at least $50.  The point of the story...  You've got a pretty mouth.  So, dude, what happens?  After you do it, they arrest him?  Yeah, you've got to catch him in the ass, right?  Oh, God.  Wait a minute.  You're a bustle.  And this really makes me a beg.  Well, what's wrong with you?  You've got low self-esteem? 
[00:11:30]  Hey, Keith, what was the code word you used to get all the other guys to come in and get the guy?  Why?  Why?  Well, the whole time he's going...  You know, why did I even want to call you to take this abuse?  You realize the tape is off?  I can't.  Realize he's off from work that day.  Hey, wait.  I'm not even working today.  That's hilarious.  No one knows I'm here.  You know what?  I called the answer.  Keith, I'm sorry.  Okay.  I'm thinking of beating like a jam.  No, no.  Keith, wait a minute.  We're sorry.  It is very funny. 
[00:12:00]  Holy ass.  It's Tuesday.  I'm not supposed to be working.  That's hilarious.  All right.  So, now you say 25 for treats.  I say 25.  Right.  Now, he turns around and says, well, how much for an oral treat for you?  Oh, like he wanted to service you.  Right.  So, now I'm like, oh, my God.  I'm like, what the hell is that all about?  You know?  He didn't tell me the price list at roll call for this one.  I'm like, you know, so I tell him 35. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, look at you.  Thank you.  And, you know.  But, I mean, if you were a gay guy out on the street and you're getting an oral treat  and getting money, I mean, it's like a win-win situation, don't you think?  Well, I think that price would be cheaper than you having to give.  And that was going through your head?  I think you screwed up, Keith.  Well, basically what happened was, you know, it was.  He said 15.  Yeah.  You're not supposed to haggle.  So, I accepted his proposition.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I gave the code for move in for. 
[00:13:00]  The code for sea sucker?  To arrest this gentleman.  Is the code pulling down his zipper and going to town?  When the guy was done, did he ask for his Ticketmaster chargeback?  That was funny.  But they move in, they arrested him.  Keith, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Boy, this Keith really gets into his job. 
[00:13:30]  So, they roll up then and arrest him.  We arrest this gentleman.  Do they have to make like they're arresting you?  Yeah, yeah.  So, it doesn't blow your cover?  Right.  Blow his cover.  Well, basically, I mean, we were out there for a long time.  So, this ended up being the only person that we caught doing this, I guess.  Oh, you didn't get any more dates?  But how close did you get to, you know, an uncomfortable situation?  Because I'm thinking if I'm one of your pals and I'm on the job, I'm going to make you sweat a little bit before we show up. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, that would suck.  All right.  Well, come on.  All right.  Did you get any more?  Well, follow me.  Everybody is pretty close to the whole situation.  Serrano's got the discs.  Serrano's got the discs.  All right.  So, they move in.  You know, they lock the guy up.  And then, you know, I was taken back.  And I had never done this before.  So, I was talking to one of the guys who does this on a normal basis.  And I said, dude, this guy wanted to give me money to, you know, take care of me. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  And they said, you know, that's a regular thing.  Really?  Yeah.  So, you know, when we got back to the station house, I said to this guy, I go, uh.  Oh, no.  You talked to him?  Yeah.  Well, I came in and I was pretending I had my hands cuffed behind my back and everything.  You know, and I'm like, dude, you know, what happened?  I'm like, you know, blah, blah, blah.  And I said, where did you just come from?  And the guy ended up, he was in some gay bar.  Really?  So, he was getting all worked up.  Yeah, but I don't understand if you're in a gay bar. 
[00:15:00]  Hey, we got audio of Keith as he's in the alleyway.  Oh.  Yeah.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Well, so I said, where are you coming from?  And he said he was in a gay bar.  So, like, if you're in a gay bar with a bunch of gay guys, what are you going outside to  pay some dude to, you know, take care of business?  Maybe he's a little shy.  Yeah.  That's all.  So, you know, he said it was really like the thrill of it, you know.  I heard Keith got a little angry at the guy. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Well, what ended up happening was, after...  He's not going to stop.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I want to hear the tape of when you got a little angry with him.  You can act like a man.  Police brutality.  He hit him.  Oh, wow.  So, finally...  Well, we got audio of the gay guy.  Stop that.  Yeah.  Suck it!  Hey, guys.  Really?  Suck it!  Hey, Keith, did you have him on tape? 
[00:16:00]  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you got a tape.  Oh, man.  But, uh, finally, the end of the whole story was, I had my hands behind my back pretending  like I was cuffed until, uh, they pulled out his money and started counting it, and he  had $85 in his pocket, and I got pissed off that he only offered me $15.  Oh, see?  He had some more money.  I, you know, then I felt cheap.  He didn't think you were hot.  That's funny.  I thought he would have tussled your hair while you did it.  So, that was just one of the many stories, but I would say that that is the best. 
[00:16:30]  I got, uh, Keith's pickup line, Anthony.  Oh, yeah, really?  Yeah.  I like charging, guys!  Well, this guy sounds, uh, we got a tape of one of the, uh, guys that wanted sex.  Yeah.  He's got a strange request, and he sounds familiar.  Tease my hair, fuck boy.  Huh.  How much would that cost?  And then he gets a little brutal with the guy.  You stupid faggot!  Then, uh, I guess he's at the police station and explains how he got into this whole life.  I didn't be until I pass out. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, I got more audio of Keith.  Oh, of course you do.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Wow, Keith's really getting into it, uh, as he does the undercover thing.  Oh, you like that, don't you faggot?  You know, sometimes you just take a little bit more of a beating than you need to. 
[00:17:30]  More audio of Keith the Cop.  Well, squeeze it!  You know, first you get abused about the EverQuest thing.  Yeah.  Then you go to this whole thing.  That's interesting.  This voice sounds a little familiar, and he was offering you, uh, 50 bucks to do this.  Can we see your stuff?  Easy.  Oh, wow.  That voice sounds so easy.  You dick.  It's not fun anymore.  Ah.  All right.  All right, yeah.  Very good. 
[00:18:00]  Well, Keith, thank God you're, uh, keeping in the streets.  Plug why I'm violent.  Hey, I got audio of, uh, the guy that picked up Keith, Anthony.  Yeah.  Virgin.  Oh, you could spot that a mile away.  How would he know that?  I don't know.  Real funny, all right.  Must be Keith's tight ass in those male hooker jeans he ought to wear.  Here's Keith's, uh, fellow officers, uh, watching, watching from afar, Anthony, waiting,  uh, waiting for the sign.  Uh-huh.  They're looking through their binoculars, and I, I, I do believe they had this to say.  It looks like I'm a wreck. 
[00:18:30]  It's in the hole!  Oh, it didn't get that far.  And then, uh, the one thing, Keith, Keith is standing on the corner, and I guess at one  point he tried to stand, uh, with his hips out a little.  Yeah.  To attract a little more guys, and the guy driving by, uh, yelled this at him.  Was that supposed to be sexy?  Uh, and I guess it wasn't.  Two guys fighting over Keith?  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  Wow.  Mule. 
[00:19:00]  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  Wow, Keith, relax.  Oh, Keith, I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  All right, fellas.  Yeah.  They're all pink on the eggs.  I'm out of here.  I'll catch on you later.  All right, Keith.  See ya.  There he goes.  There goes Keith the cop, everyone.  As a, a male hooker.  You know damn well he dressed a little different.  Like he just, like he just, yeah, yeah, he just makes it sound like he just went out there.  Like, oh, I'm doing that, let me walk out.  He had to think about something.  Maybe Keith's fellow officers could call us and, and tell us what they think Keith was wearing. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, what do, uh, what do the guys got to wear?  You're not just going out there like you're regular, you know, you usually do.  Look at him, cute in them jeans.  Wearing them tight jeans.  Ron, what's up?  Hey, O&A.  Hey.  What's going on?  Uh, Keith is gone, but I wanted to ask him, uh, if when a guy offers to perform on him,  if the code word for the other cops to move in is, ooh-ho-ho-ho, go, on your knees. 
[00:20:00]  Hookers just make, uh, make for great shows.  Anthony, we got Rocco checking in.  Oh, Rocco?  Hey, Rocco.  Hey, Rocco.  Hey, don't be unfunny.  How's it going?  What's up, Schlockhole?  Hey, I want to know if there's any chance of Keith the crotch transferring to Worcester.  Why?  35's a good deal.  Oh, wait, for you to give him all the favors?  Yeah, as long as all I ask is a little jaw rub later.  Really?  Yeah, a little rub down from my jaw, but that's all. 
[00:20:30]  Rockhole, you know you're live on our show, right?  Whoa.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Take me off the air.  Hold on.  That's not funny.  That's not funny at all.  What?  I ask for one thing.  You talk to me off the air.  What?  But Rockhole, this sounds like one of your great fake bits.  Oh, come on.  That's not even funny, isn't he?  This isn't going to help your ratings by admitting that you might like guys.  We don't know that for sure.  Has anyone seen the pictures from the studio? 
[00:21:00]  I think this is a lot of man-ass.  I don't think it's that you might like guys.  We all know the truth.  That's a lot of man-ass.  I think this is just another desperate move by yourself to try to get your ratings up there.  I'm in Jamaica.  What do you mean?  I don't need desperate moves.  All right, Rockhole.  We're hanging.  And as long as Keith tastes like crisp apples, I'm fine with it.  All right.  All right, Rockhole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Take it easy, Rockhole.  We don't know if Rockhole goes that way, Anthony, do we?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  But that guy who said he was Rockhole, he seems to think that he would pay $35 to be 
[00:21:30]  able to give oral treats to another man.  Whatever.  Sounded like the guy.  I don't know.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Don't be an a-hole.  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go after yourself, bud.  And EWs.  1-R-2-7.  You'll be an Anthony show.  W and EW.  Yeah, we're back. 
[00:22:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, we got some tape to play.  Oh, yeah.  Hopefully do it before the end of the show.  Rich Voss in the hey-house. 
[00:22:30]  In the hey-house.  Hey-house.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Jim Norton in the hey-house.  You know what's not in the house?  A phone line that works, Verizon.  You suck.  Some cute girl was on the line from Verizon.  She was going to help you out.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Well, we went along with the Rich Voss segment.  Oh, Voss.  So maybe she could call back.  No, that's not Voss.  Voss didn't promise me a phone line.  All right.  It's not about you, Jim, because a legend is walking into the studio.  The legend.  Not that legend.  Another legend. 
[00:23:00]  Ah, there he is.  Hey, what's up?  The man, everybody, I love to hate.  It's the Iron Sheik.  Back in the old days.  The Iron Sheik.  There he is.  Look at you.  You look just like you did back in the old days.  Thank you.  You said that.  Are you Anthony or O.P.?  I am Anthony.  That is O.P.  First of all, pleasure for me, to you guys,  bringing me from Olympic City, Atlanta, Georgia.  Yes.  The Big Apple, the most famous city in the world.  That's why I've come three times champion World Wrestling Federation. 
[00:23:30]  Uh-huh.  The most famous arena in the world, Manhattan, Madison, Surrogarden.  All right.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, to the lesson, to the WNEW number one station  in America.  And pleasure to talk to O.P. and Anthony.  Very good.  Thank you.  So much.  Wait, what?  Iron Sheik.  Thank you, sir.  And what the hell are you doing with yourself these days?  Well, I'm here. 
[00:24:00]  My agents, Steve Kaplan, called me from Georgia and bring me to Big Apple.  We have a couple autograph sections.  Oh.  Wow.  So back in the day, I mean, everyone, you were a pretty bad guy.  Well, you know.  People didn't like you.  It was during that.  I know what you mean.  I didn't involve with the politician or Ayatollah Khomeini, but I grew up with all my life  with the toughest sport in the world, freestyle and Greco-Roman, to I come to wrestling with 
[00:24:30]  the Mr. McMahon World Wrestling Federation.  Right.  And I come three times WWF champion besides Olympic, besides AAU, besides World Games.  I remember all the great matches against you and Sergeant Slaughter.  Yes.  Had a lot of good ones during the Gulf War time period.  Very big, very big.  I remember that.  Especially that campwood match.  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Yes.  And then you came out, you'd wave the flag, and everyone would throw stuff at you.  Well, you know, because I was a red, I'm telling you, Parisian man, oldest country in 
[00:25:00]  the world, but I'll be honest with you, I didn't grow up with the politician.  No.  I grew up with the sport, toughest sport in the Olympic, freestyle and Greco-Roman.  So you never wanted to get rid of America or anything for real, right?  Not really, because, you know, I know I born in the oldest country in the world, Tehran,  Iran, but I made it in America, greatest country in the earth, especially the most famous arena  in the world, Madison Square Garden.  Madison Square Garden.  Yes.  He mentions the garden more than Dice does. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  I have a lot of friends.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling friends in the Big Apple.  Yes.  And also Iranian people.  And I love to you people.  I listen to the WNEW number one station in America.  You didn't just give all the cab drivers a code word to run people over, did you?  And sir, NEW is not even the number one station on 57th. 
[00:26:00]  This station sucks.  What country are you from?  I'm originally from all this country in the world, Iran.  Iran.  Iran.  Tehran.  Tehran.  Really?  Tell us a little bit about that.  I love Iran.  Iran.  How old were you when you left Iran?  My last Olympic, I competed in 1968, Mexico City.  I was a coach for University of Minnesota, 1969 and 1970. 
[00:26:30]  And I went to Olympic Munich, Germany.  And after Munich, Germany, 72, I turned professional.  And then I made it in Big Apple.  So you left.  Wait, wait, wait.  You made it in the Big Apple.  Where did you make it in the Big Apple?  Well, Mr. McMahon, senior, God bless you so.  Yes.  He passed away and then they found out.  Arsenio died?  What just did I hear?  No, it was career.  No, that was his father.  Mr. McMahon, senior.  No, but you made it in the Big Apple.  Where did you make it in the Big Apple there? 
[00:27:00]  Well, I made it in the Big Apple too.  I come for wrestling in the most famous arena in the world.  Oh, that's right.  All right.  That's right.  Yes, sir.  You had big matches there, huh?  Yes, sir.  Ring the bell.  Ring the bell.  I come single champion and Nicola and I become tag team champion.  Yes.  And also by the world three times.  Really?  Three times?  Yes, sir.  And you'd come out and you'd wear what was thought to us as traditional Iranian garb.  You'd have the curly shoes on.  Absolutely.  I remember that and you'd wave the flag and people would yell and scream horrible things 
[00:27:30]  at you and Sergeant Slaughter would come in and start beating you up and everyone would  cheer.  Not really, Evan.  You're right.  Maybe he can beat me once a while, but most of the time I was a winner, especially I beat  that Hollywood blonde, Jabroni Hogan and Madison Sierra Garden in New York and six  years nobody beat Mr. Bob Buckland.  Also, I beat him in the garden.  Bob Buckland?  Over at the queue?  Sir, Mr. Bob Buckland.  Bob Buckland.  Back one.  But the people, you're right, Anthony, or of you, because people didn't like me because 
[00:28:00]  I used to cheer Ayatollah Khomeini flag.  Right.  And I was a real country, man.  Well, you know what?  And his famous line was, Iran is the best and then he would spit.  Right.  I used to say, yeah, Russia number one, Iran number one.  Right.  USA, ah, poof.  But no, I don't say anymore.  Well, no, you better not.  No, no, I say, no, I say.  It's not really the climate to say that now, right?  Right.  Have you noticed maybe that act wouldn't play too well these days, right? 
[00:28:30]  Not really because, you know, like I said, I born of a country, but I made it America.  Greatest wrestling country, greatest country on earth.  You ever do a Dutch jam audience?  You ever do Dutch jam?  Never did Jeff comedy jam.  Shut up, boss.  No, I'm not into the comedy.  Not into the comedy.  I'm part of the decolize on the comedy and or...  Because I heard somebody had called us up and said that the Iron Sheik was doing stand-up comedy.  No, sir.  Somebody else used my name.  He uses your name.  Right.  And then they did that. 
[00:29:00]  But I'm the only one from all this country in the world.  Tehran, Iran.  Tehran, Iran.  And then you came here to the U.S.  And you were at, what was that big place that you wrestled at?  Madison Square Garden, New York.  Madison Square Garden, number one.  Number one arena.  The most famous arena in the world.  Of course.  Madison Square Garden, New York, number one.  Now, also, I want to know about, though, who's the Russian guy?  Nikolai Volkov.  Nikolai Volkov.  Remember that?  They would come out and it was all, we hated you. 
[00:29:30]  And I heard you had some problems at an airport.  Is that true?  Well, I've been to the airport in Georgia usually since September 11.  And at that time, the Middle East, maybe I'm involved with the tourists.  But I'm not really.  I grew up with the toughest sport in the world, wrestling.  But they check me and they take my tennis shoes off.  They take my socks off.  They check me out on.  And then they found out I'm Iron Sheik.  I gave them a couple of pictures.  Everybody was happy.  Oh, is that it?  Yes, sir.  So they found out you were the Iron Sheik and no problems with your shoes. 
[00:30:00]  You weren't wearing them curly shoes, though.  Yes, sir.  That's an alteration in all countries.  We used to wear it.  Walked up.  But you don't walk through an airport security with the curly shoes on.  Well, you know.  If you want to get on the plane quickly, I'd recommend not wearing the curly shoes.  Leave them at home.  Yes, sir.  Not anymore because, you know, that was a custom of them.  Many of these customs.  But from since that, you're right, Anthony.  I don't wear it anymore.  Right.  What's with the curly shoe? 
[00:30:30]  Well, that's an alteration in all countries.  The oldest country.  Right.  Oldest Tehran, Iran.  And we walked up in the sand.  We don't get burned.  Our feet doesn't get burned.  So walk through the sand?  Right.  But sometimes I have a lot of camel.  I do with it.  We call car one.  And then I kill all the camel all night.  The camel?  Yeah, the camel.  I hear you.  Yes.  Whatever happened to Bob Backlund and Sergeant Slaughter?  Well, Bob Backlund, Sergeant Slaughter is one of the agents and still is an employee for the WWF. 
[00:31:00]  And Mr. Bob Backlund, six years, nobody beat him.  He's with the radio check over at the Q here in New York.  Greatest city in the world.  Wow.  Yes, sir.  Now, I want to know where he defeated Hulk Hogan.  Oh, you did have a big match with Hulk Hogan.  That was, as a matter of fact, Madison Square Garden.  It was Madison Square Garden.  I remember that like it was yesterday.  What do you think about Hulk Hogan being back with the WWF? 
[00:31:30]  Oh, good question.  Thank you, Opie.  Well, Mr. McMahon is a genius.  He's the smartest, number one promoter in the world.  He knows if there's some talent like Hulk Hogan or some another, they can bring the people,  put on the seat for his company.  Right.  And always, he hired again.  And age doesn't matter.  And as long as they know, the talent, there are money for his company.  Exactly. 
[00:32:00]  And he's the best promoter.  Well, that's why I bring him back.  That's what I'm getting to now.  Any chance of maybe seeing the Iron Sheik back with the WWF?  I'll be honest with you.  I'm on the road, Anthony, 37 years old.  I prefer to be...  You're 37 years old?  37 years I'm on the road.  Oh, you're on the road, I was going to say.  Somebody said that, too.  You know, you're kind of skirting your age a little higher.  You might want to pump it up a little bit.  37 to the third power.  You know, pump it up a little higher.  And I prefer to share my experience for freestyle Greco-Roman and professional to all young... 
[00:32:30]  Greco-Roman, I like how he says that.  Right, Greco-Roman and freestyle.  Freestyle Greco-Roman.  The toughest sport in the world, one-on-one.  It's not Michael Jordan sport or not football.  It's an individual, one-on-one.  And that's two men.  Now they get in a ring.  And what do they got to do?  A Greco-Roman.  That's not a Greco-Roman.  That's a professional.  Like Westwickman said, we are determined.  Right, so that's the real, like, wrestling where you got to do the holds and pin and... 
[00:33:00]  Exactly.  I heard that started out, the men were nude doing this back in the olden days in what, Greece?  Well, that was maybe a thousand, thousand years ago.  That was a Greek.  That was the first Olympic, as a matter of fact, was a Greek.  Those Greeks, they want to be naked with each other, the men, right?  That's their business, right?  I hear you.  We call that prison.  Nothing like that happens in Tehran, Iran.  Not really, no.  Because Tehran, Iran, they are serious people, Islamic, Muslim people. 
[00:33:30]  They seem like serious people.  And then we have a lot of great wrestlers like Takhti, Habibi, Zandi, and we never go in the mat to be nude.  Are you famous in Iran?  I'm the Shah of Iran.  His wife, Muhammad Reza Shah Pahlavi.  His wife, Farah Pahlavi.  Right.  I was a three-year bodyguard.  Oh, you were the bodyguard.  So the Shah, you were a bodyguard?  With the Shah of Iran.  You couldn't guard against that cancer, though, could you?  Yes, and I had that job and worked at the National Iranian Television because I was an Iranian, Greco-Roman, and freestyle wrestler. 
[00:34:00]  Greco-Roman.  Right.  And they gave me that job.  Boy, good thing you got when the getting was good.  I don't think when the Ayatollah got into power, I don't think the bodyguards of the Shah were popular guys.  You know what I mean?  Not that time, right.  No, no.  You've got to get your curly shoes and run your ass off out of that country.  Absolutely.  Yes, sir.  Because you have Greco-Roman, they have guns.  Exactly.  You know what I mean? 
[00:34:30]  Since Ayatollah took over, he was a position of the Secret Service, Savak, Rural, Army, Navy, and that was different timing.  But I was your country before that revolution.  Yeah, well, good thing.  Glad to have you.  You gave us a lot of entertainment over the years.  What did you think of today's wrestling there?  Today, wrestling still is the number one sport in your country, America, or in the world, because one of the top shows in your country, television, is the World Wrestling Federation.  And people watch wrestling more than football or any other sport. 
[00:35:00]  And I remember I wrestled in Nikola and I, Pontiac, Michigan, 93,000 people can't watch that much.  Nobody sold out Pontiac, Michigan.  Pontiac, Michigan.  Yeah, Pontiac, Michigan, exact World Wrestling Federation.  That was a big arena there at the, what is that called?  Yes, sir.  That place at Pontiac?  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  So, anyway, I want to say again.  What's the one in New York?  Does that hold more people or less than Pontiac?  Oh, well, Madison, sir. 
[00:35:30]  That one.  25,000.  25,000, so more in Pontiac, Michigan.  I hear.  Do you have a television set?  Do you have a TV?  In all countries, no, but I have a TV in Georgia.  See Norton?  He's got a TV.  Get a goddamn television.  I need a TV, sir.  What's wrong with you?  The guy doesn't have a television.  Do you have a phone that works?  Do you have a telephone?  Another thing I don't have.  Verizon stinks.  I'm sorry, sir.  My agency, Steve Capitan, have a cell phone and telephone.  All right.  Again, I want to say thank you for 1027-WNEW, number one station in America. 
[00:36:00]  For pleasure to talk to you guys.  If NEW, this station here in New York, was a wrestler, it would be on the mat, pinned for the count.  Right.  Done.  All right.  This show is very good.  We have fun here.  Well, let's get Mr. Agent Guy to give the plug again.  Yeah, give the plug one more time.  Right on the mic, man.  We have a lot of people that listen to us here.  No, no, no.  On the mic.  On the mic.  www.stupid.com slash Iron Cheek. 
[00:36:30]  You've reached the Iron Cheek on the internet.  All right.  Great.  I want to say again hello to all my wrestling friends in New York, and especially all American,  Paris, and Middle East, and wherever.  God bless you, everybody.  Pleasure to come back again one more time to talk to Anthony and Opion.  Right.  God bless you guys.  Anthony and Opion.  Thank you, Iron Cheek.  And what about Madison Square Garden?  Madison Square Garden, the most famous arena in the world, and number one.  Ya Allah, ya Muhammad, ya Ali.  All right. 
[00:37:00]  Thank you.  There he goes.  The Iron Cheek.  The freestyle and Greco-Roman.  Greco.  Iron Sheek.  Oh, no.  All right.  There goes the Sheek.  Look at this guy.  You're not going to kill him.  Okay.  You're a big guy.  I wouldn't mess with you.  He's a big guy.  Look at him.  I know.  Give him a couple pictures of everybody.  Iron Sheek.  Iron Sheek.  Give a picture.  Come here, you big bastard.  Look at you.  Who's more out of it?  I got an Iron Sheek hug.  Thank you, my friend.  Give it to me.  Thank you, my friend.  Give to me a picture. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Thank you, Iron Sheek.  I got mine, Iron Sheek.  Yes.  There you go.  Okay.  Thank you, my friend.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Muhammad Ali is going to speak.  Float like a cinder block and sting like foam rubber.  I want another fight with Smolder and Joe Frazier. 
[00:38:00]  The Thriller and Vanilla and Chocolate.  What?  Too many.  I did too many of those Decon Foregon commercials.  All right.  Muhammad, set off the Decon Foregon in the room.  The bomb for the bugs.  Remember he was doing those commercials?  Oh, Decon Foregon.  Knocks them down.  Knocks out the bugs.  All right.  No, you didn't get it right.  Set off another one.  Decon Foregon.  Bugs be running out.  Oh, Muhammad, we didn't have the light right. 
[00:38:30]  Okay.  Set off another.  Decon Foregon.  That's probably what did it.  Insecticide.  I would knock it out by DDT.  I hear a boar.  A float like JFK Jr.  And a sting like a marshmallow.  That's quality stuff.  I am the greatest.  Stupid. 
[00:39:00]  The award-winning Opie and Anthony show.  This has got to be a joke, people.  Hey, geeky, geeky.  W.  1027.  W.  W.  The Opie and Anthony show.  23 skidoo.  Here comes the radio nine.  Here comes the boys on the sound.  Here comes the radio nine. 
[00:39:30]  How you like me now, I say.  Woo.  Here comes the radio nine.  Here comes the radio nine.  Here comes the radio nine.  How you like me now, I say.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  What's that from?  The improper Bostonian?  The improper Bostonian Opie.  They have the improper personals.  Ha ha.  Obviously, it's up in Boston.  It's a paper up in Boston. 
[00:40:00]  And somebody took out a little personal ad.  Ha ha.  Because they have a problem with this program.  They took out a personal ad?  Yeah.  Because they have a problem.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  You want to hear it?  Yeah, sorry.  I just like the ha ha.  Oh, that's a great song, man.  P.O.D., bro.  Yes.  You can enjoy it and love Jesus at the same time listening to a P.O.D., right? 
[00:40:30]  Enjoy the hard rock music, yet feel the love of Jesus Christ flow into your body.  Ha ha.  They're Christian rockers.  Are they?  They're Christian rockers.  How nice of them.  But at least it's not like Striper.  All of it.  Anything Christian rock stinks.  But it's good.  It doesn't sound like Christian rock.  All right.  You're right.  Creed is like Christian rock.  Really?  Creed's pretty damn close to Christian rock.  Ozzy or Sabbath.  Really?  Yeah.  And Motorhead when they play it.  Who to you is Jesus Christ? 
[00:41:00]  Ozzy, right?  He really is.  Sure.  Who's on my shirt?  Opie, this from the improper Bostonian.  BCN listeners, it's entitled.  Ooh.  I am all, and they all start like this.  I'm all for free speech.  Oh, yeah.  But!  Yeah.  And I happen to love WBCN.  Uh-oh.  However, is anyone else out there ever offended by the Opie and Anthony show?  I am.  Ha ha!  Ponder that. 
[00:41:30]  Poo!  Ha ha ha.  On February 22nd, the show was about how they had women there eating all kinds of gross  things.  I guess people were trying to qualify for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We had them eating blood and stuff.  Yeah.  They had one woman.  Brains.  In her underwear, drinking out of a toilet bowl like a dog.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha!  I had a rod looking at her, you whore.  It just looked so perfect. 
[00:42:00]  Isn't it great?  That was fun.  Yeah, but we had, I remember that bit.  We had chocolate pudding all around the bowl.  We spread chocolate pudding around the bowl.  And this lovely lady, she was beautiful.  I think she was from the Philly area.  Yeah.  She had to lick the bowl to get into the 55-gallon drum show.  Right.  Like a dog.  Like a dog.  I tried calling WBCN to talk with them about it.  Yeah, that always goes well, you dope.  Just turn the radio off, you stupid hole.  God almighty, why would you call? 
[00:42:30]  Isn't it amazing?  Oh, I f***ing hate people.  I really, really hate people.  He says, I f***ing hate people very loud.  I hope your kid loses his hand in a lawnmower.  These are the people that will ruin it for everyone.  No, they won't.  Oh, yes, they will.  Because no one listens to her.  You're a fat whore.  Oh, yes, they will.  Nah, no one cares about her.  She's a pig.  Slowly but surely, people like this are winning the battle.  They're not winning the battle.  She's a pig.  And this shows that BCN is right on the ball here. 
[00:43:00]  It says, they gave me the number for the Opie and Anthony show, which is a good thing.  That's what they should do, which I have tried calling numerous times.  It rings and rings and rings.  No machine, no person, no nothing.  Good.  Now, what number, I wonder, what number she got?  This number, because these phones get answered all the time.  Awesome Garrett is awesome, if I may say, at answering the phone.  So, they put misogynistic crap on the radio and then make it impossible to contact them. 
[00:43:30]  Very classy.  So, I'm airing my grievance here.  Oedipus, are you listening?  Hell no.  He's not in there right now.  He's not at the station.  He's out having fun doing something.  Yeah, probably playing golf.  Playing golf.  We're relaxing.  Or, you know.  Is he snorting cocoa in the secret room?  Or stealing CDs.  Right, and selling them to record stores.  Or selling the CDs back to the record stores to make his fortune.  He's a busy man.  God, that bugs me. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, so that was from the improper Bostonian.  Well, she wants to decide for everyone else what is appropriate on the airwave.  A radio is a device, right?  It's a machine.  It's an appliance.  It's whatever you want to call it.  It's got an off switch.  Here is something similar to people not turning off the radio when they're annoyed by it.  You might want to turn this down a little bit.  Hi.  Hello.  Jackhammer Company?  Yeah.  I have a jackhammer here in my living room. 
[00:44:30]  And it's really loud, and it's annoying me.  I'm calling to complain about the sound of the jackhammer.  See?  Here, listen.  It's just going and going.  It's in my house, and I hear it.  And my kids are hearing it.  And it's offensive, and it's loud, and it's annoying.  The watch switch?  Oh.  No, I know I can turn it off.  I choose not to.  I choose to have it very loud in my living room, and then call you, because you made the jackhammer, 
[00:45:00]  and complain about the noise.  What?  Oh, the bus is coming.  Oh.  Oh, yeah, that's much better.  Okay.  Same thing.  All right, thank you.  Why would you, if your blender was on, and it was making too much noise, you're going  to call the blender company?  Hey, it's making too much noise.  Now, you turn it off.  If these people want something to complain about, I'm going to go to a Jeff Norris show. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, God.  The Voss-Norris battle.  The never-ending battle.  Started it last week.  Hey, at least he was on SNL last Saturday.  Wait, I've got to say something.  Yeah.  Voss comes by just to say hi, because you had an audition at what, VH1 or something?  Yeah, well.  Oh, yeah, big news.  Big news for Rich Voss.  They were testing me for, you know, a pilot.  My own pilot.  And you go, I just stopped by just to say hi.  I'm not going to go on the radio or anything.  He sits down.  He puts his headphones on.  Yeah, he puts the cans on.  Turns on his microphone. 
[00:46:00]  Hi, Rich Voss here.  And the first chance he gets, he makes fun of Jeff Norris.  You're classic.  Sat down.  He's got a cigarette.  He's all set up now, man.  You're classic.  I wasn't going to want to go on.  And I just stopped in to say hi, Nancy.  This is trash.  Of course.  It was just funny.  It's so funny.  That's a freaking liar.  And he's trying to be casual.  And I'm happy for stupid.  He got a show and he deserves it.  He's like, wow, it's only a pilot.  Shut up.  So is Mohammed Antha. 
[00:46:30]  Be happy you got it.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Oh.  You know, we're going to get complaints now.  Comedy gone too far, Jim Norton.  You're right.  There's focus groups that are critiquing you as we speak.  Good.  So what's up with the pilot, Bob?  Yeah, what is this?  Oh.  Oh, I don't want to talk about it.  Don't act like you have a bunch of pilots.  Which one are we talking about?  Well, this one.  It's just, it's something for VH1.  VH1.  Yes, we've all heard of that. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, we're going to shoot it next week.  And, you know, you don't want to really tell the storyline before it happens.  That would just make people want to see it.  That was, well, you know, it's going to be like a talk show.  It's like a call-in talk show.  It's the right thing, yeah.  Yeah.  And it's going to, it's me and another person.  Will someone be calling and going, hi, is Daddy there?  I love that bit. 
[00:47:30]  No, because I'm dodging it.  Does this pilot have a name?  Yeah, the unhappy hour.  Really?  Yeah, it's called the unhappy hour.  Perfect.  And you're going to be taking calls from people.  Yeah.  And discussing what?  Anything?  Anything they want to talk about.  Anything they want to talk about.  Any problems they might have.  They might have some problems and we'll talk about it.  And you're there to solve their problems?  No, myself and a...  Get a tattoo of the Star of David.  That solves my problems.  No, it'll be...  Start gambling. 
[00:48:00]  Myself and a psychotherapist.  A real psychotherapist?  Yes.  Oh.  That's very good.  Okay.  I've tested with three of them and this one is great.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  This is good.  So, I mean, you know...  How can you help people?  Your life's in the toilet.  How can you help people?  From experience.  From experience.  How to get a chick out of the car 30 seconds after you spill one in her face.  You're an awful creeper human.  He's always saying, I need a girlfriend.  Well, you're not a nice guy. 
[00:48:30]  You're awful.  But I can see.  See what I mean right there?  I should tell him what not to do.  Did you just dump?  Run.  Pull him to the emptiest hotel and say it's sold out.  That's my favorite story of all time.  Dude, one time me and him, this is creep.  We're in Pennsylvania.  One time, it's true.  We're in Pennsylvania doing a gig and we're hanging out.  And he was, has a rap.  He's talking to this girl years ago.  She's maybe a five.  She looks like Foghorn Leghorn's nephew. 
[00:49:00]  She has glasses.  She's awful.  That little kid?  Yeah.  She works for CBS.  She's a horrendous Pennsylvania trash.  CBS, right?  CBS.  No, not the network.  No, the pharmacy.  And he gets her back to the room.  And we're just sitting there and she's showing us a tattoo on her ass.  Oh, my God.  And I'm going, I'm trying to sniff.  And he's giggling from the front.  And she's like, she's going to leave.  And he goes, do you just want to watch me and him J-O?  And she's like, what?  And he's like, well, just J-O and you can watch.  And she ran out of the room. 
[00:49:30]  The parting shot.  Like you saw that all your options were used.  Yeah.  I was being a team player.  I tried to get the waitress to go in the closet with you.  And look at my mule, yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's awful.  You're helping him out?  Yeah.  Oh, are you kidding me?  He's awful.  Yeah.  Hey, Rich.  Hi.  How you doing?  How do you get a girl to watch you and your friend J-O in a hotel room?  Well, from my experience. 
[00:50:00]  That's brilliant, man.  My favorite is when me and him were on the bed with a girl.  I told you the story right in the air.  Oh, God.  And the girl's in the middle of us, and we're both whacking our bags.  She's in between us, of course.  That is so gay.  No, it's not.  There's three.  There's a girl between us.  There's a girl.  And he goes, hey, let's flip a coin, and the loser has to F her.  To me, over her, he says it. 
[00:50:30]  What a pig.  You are despicable.  What does she do?  Jesus.  And I laughed nervously, because he had a rod.  He was real.  I couldn't get a rod.  I kept laughing.  And then she gets up and gets off the bed for a minute.  We look over at each other.  We're like, all right, we've got to stop for a second.  And this is what a selfish pig voice is.  The loser has to F her.  He finishes, right?  Oh, God.  He finishes.  Then I'm on the bed with her.  I'm packing like a half. 
[00:51:00]  He goes to the bathroom, and I guess there's a cat log in the thing.  I hear him going, hey, hey, hey.  Trying not to puke while I whack my bag.  It was awful.  His cough.  He was automatically out of the sex mood.  Rocking a Jewish throat.  Did he finish, like, on the bed? 
[00:51:30]  I didn't look where it went.  Oh, you're close enough.  I was looking at her and just trying to hope he didn't say anything else that made me laugh.  I was laughing the whole time.  Where did you find this creature?  She was some girl he knew.  She lived out of the state.  She came in for, like, three days, and then we went to the hotel.  And then how do you start?  What are you just, you're all laying on the bed.  Dude, you're watching TV.  How do you start just pulling your hog out?  It's called good cop, bad cop.  And he will actually go, do you mind if me and him just say, oh.  And I'm like, oh, come on, man. 
[00:52:00]  Cut it at me while I'm un-dripping my fly.  Oh, my God.  And he'll start.  He's like, come on, just touch it.  And then she's looking at me.  I'm like, I don't know what he's doing.  I'm like, just touch it.  Shut him up.  Holy smoke.  That is sick.  But he's always the one that leads into these things.  I'm never able to pull the girls up and do this.  And she just stayed there.  Did anyone get to have sex with her?  No, we didn't.  And did she even touch anybody? 
[00:52:30]  She might have.  Oh, really?  Now, the girl or Voss?  The girl.  Oh, okay.  I wouldn't want to gag him and hear that one.  Like I can get over those speed bumps.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Lewis, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say that I think I've seen Rich Voss' show before.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it's called Loveline on MTV. 
[00:53:00]  Later.  It's like a VH1 version.  Yeah, it could be.  I never saw that show, so I don't know.  I can't.  Well, they got a comic and a psychologist that sit and take phone calls and solve people's problems.  So it's a little similar.  It's about Voss' Saturday night.  It's called Never Mind the Black.  You're horrible.  You can't use that C word. 
[00:53:30]  What did I say?  Anthony.  Do we have any more?  You look like Ricky Hattie.  Anthony's going to bring up a good point here.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Okay.  Anthony, you said before something about how do you go about starting this whole J.O. Fest?  Yeah.  I want to know, Voss and Norton, how the hell did the two of you find out that you're comfortable  even doing it together?  Right.  I'll tell you how.  Not even in front of the girl there.  Very good.  I'll tell you how.  I'll tell you.  One of the first experiences I had with Voss that made me like, no, we can do it.  No, we can do it.  Cool. 
[00:54:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Voss to get out of my car.  This is years ago.  After a set.  And I'm laughing.  And I laughed.  And he closed my door and went into the parking garage and got his car.  And then, wait, hold on, sir.  I'm explaining here.  You know?  And then there was a time where he was dating a girl.  And he's like, I'm going to try to get her to give me a Hummer while you watch, meaning  me.  And I had strapped at home.  She was hot.  Really hot.  And I had just finished at home. 
[00:54:30]  Literally.  Like, my belly button really smelled like a fish.  And I come into the city.  This is where I live in, New Jersey.  And there they are.  I walk by, I see Voss and this girl in the car.  And I get in the back seat.  And I can't even get a ride because I had just arrived.  And, you know, she's humming him.  And I'm like, you look at the back of it.  Like, yeah.  Wow, cool.  And we're just comfortable.  Because, you know.  Really?  It's cool.  Who cares?  Yeah.  What's the big deal?  It's not like we're touching each other.  Not at all.  What are you kidding me?  We don't even shake hands.  I know.  I won't touch hands. 
[00:55:00]  We're disgusted by each other.  You kidding me?  You're like the perverted odd couple.  Yeah.  You got the...  Exactly.  I'm a neat freak and he has AIDS.  Well, I got rid of it.  I had soup.  Soup cured it.  Chicken soup, yeah.  Chicken soup cured the AIDS.  Yeah, I got rid of it.  For this week.  Thank you, Anthony.  See you later, guys.  How did they know we were a cowboy woman?  Oh, Jesus.  Well, most guys don't do that with each other.  Never.  In my life. 
[00:55:30]  I mean, I've had other friends where we've, I guess, you know, trained.  Is that what they call it?  Yeah.  What's the big deal?  But, you know, you know what the thing is?  You can't just start a story that you're laying there next to a girl on either side jacking.  You can't just drop us in in the middle of that story.  We need a little background on how the hell you got to that point.  That's all I was saying.  We do it all the time.  It's funny.  We don't care.  Who cares?  I'm not homophobic.  I don't care.  I don't think he's going to try to lick my mule again.  And I tell him, hey, look, that's for girls. 
[00:56:00]  He cries a little.  And I say, look, nothing personal.  Oh, God.  He had Ticketron's number on his mule.  April 18th.  Why?  I could go on air and say, and this isn't gay, but Norton's packing it.  I mean, every other part of his body is pathetic.  If you look at him, I mean, if you look at his no pigment, his physique looks like Jell-O, all right? 
[00:56:30]  But he's packing, see?  And that's the whole thing.  That's what gives him confidence.  Yeah.  That must be it.  Actually, you know, I mean, I'm not saying I haven't seen Bigger, but, you know, he's doing over.  He sucked Bigger.  So that's why, like, if we're the girl, like, I'm not going to follow him.  I've got to open.  Oh, there you go.  See?  All right.  Goddamn.  What a relationship you two have.  That's amazing.  That's hilarious. 
[00:57:00]  Who knew the comedy circuit had this going on?  That's hilarious.  Any other comics ever join in your hijinks?  Oh, yeah, I've been on quite a few trains, and I can't mention names.  Oh, really?  Any that have been on this program?  One, maybe.  One, maybe.  That's years ago, though.  I haven't been on it.  This is true.  I'm 33.  I haven't been on one of these probably in seven years.  Right.  It's just something you do at one point in your life.  It's silly.  And it's usually, they're not girls that you're dating.  They're just girls that you hook up with, and they're, like, in a kinky mood.  There you go.  I'd kill them afterwards. 
[00:57:30]  Whatever.  Whatever.  One time, weren't you with a girl, and you used Patrice as a bed?  Well, at the time, you were, no, I've been to the Central Park store.  I mean, we've had a few.  Oh, the Central Park.  Oh, yeah.  No, you know something?  I forgot it.  There's a lot of new listeners.  What's the Central Park?  I forgot it.  That's a great story.  You want to tell it?  I'll tell Paul.  You tell Paul.  Because me and him were coming out of this place in the village, and this black girl  walked up to him.  That doesn't sound good right away.  No.  And a black girl walked up to him.  She's gorgeous. 
[00:58:00]  And she goes, oh, I saw you at the comedy club.  So they were talking, all of us.  And Voss is smooth, man.  So he gets her to go out.  He buys her a drink.  No, she had a drink.  No, we went to eat at a bagel place.  So she had one drink, and we went to eat at a bagel place on 54th and Broadway.  And then he gets her in a peep booth somehow right next door.  No, I said, we're going to go watch movies.  Movies, yeah.  Pornographic movies at a peep.  I'll tell it up until Central Park, maybe.  You tell it up until Central Park, and you finish.  Look at you, too.  Just like the girl. 
[00:58:30]  You start, I'll finish.  I'll tell you, good cop, bad cop.  And meanwhile, they're like, I don't know who I am.  And so we're like, he's got her in a peep booth, and they're fooling around.  And I'm in the next booth just trying to listen a little bit.  So we go outside.  It's like 3 in the morning.  We're standing by Rich's car.  It's between Rich's car and a newsstand.  He's making out with her.  And he's feeling her up, and he's got, you know, the old double-knuckle lesson.  Right.  Right across from the Letterman Theater.  Right across from the, it's all the theater, yes.  And I'm squatting down behind her, trying to put my hand up her dress. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, good.  And she's disgusted.  She wants nothing to do with me.  But she really likes him.  Oh, God.  You're the odd man out.  I'm like dating a chick with kids.  I'm the kid.  Like, you tolerate, even though you hate.  He's like, all right, just let him do it.  Let him do it.  I'm like reaching up, and I'm tucking her behind me.  Oh, that is horrid.  She's feeling violated, but she likes him.  And then we go to Central Park.  Well, but she finishes on Broadway, too.  Okay.  Finished with who?  She did.  Him.  Oh, she did?  Yeah.  You got it a shake? 
[00:59:30]  On Broadway.  Wow.  Okay.  So you go to Central Park.  Yeah, we go behind a tree.  We don't want to go too far in the park.  Behind a tree.  Well, dangerous in the park, sure.  Over the wall, behind a wall or something.  And then all of a sudden, I forget what happened.  I don't.  Well, she's going south on me.  Yeah.  Right?  Like, you know.  And whistling without a problem.  And people, you know, there's always this, there's a difference between reality and radio 
[01:00:00]  stories, too.  Remember that out there.  So she's going south on me.  So you're standing up, right?  I'm standing up.  She's standing over now.  No, I'm hanging from a tree to make her feel at home.  Oh, man.  Wait, hold on.  Listen.  So she's going south.  And I look down.  And I see his little bald head and tongue in a place you're not supposed to put your tongue.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Right?  Oh, my God.  But it looks like a kid who just found candy on Easter, right? 
[01:00:30]  And he's.  All you see is his eyes.  All I see is this little bald head.  Oh, my God.  It looks like the cartoon Ziggy.  Kilroy was here.  Kilroy was here.  And I was like, he's standing.  She's best.  Oh, my God.  And I'm swotting.  I'm swotting.  So this girl, she's like a 10, too.  Hot.  So I finish. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, my God.  I talked her into, I said, you know, take care of my friend a little.  She's humming me.  Oh, I've got to tell him the other story.  So I go, take care of my friend, too.  Right?  You know.  And she does whatever.  So we're driving home.  We dump her or whatever.  I told her the hotel was sold out.  We're driving home.  And I look at him.  I go, well, did you have a good time?  He said, well, I was a little uncomfortable.  I didn't want to get my pants dirty.  I go, what? 
[01:01:30]  You'll be a strange girl.  No, wait a minute.  See, oh, wow.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  We almost made it through the whole story.  You can't use the, oh, okay.  I said my legs are sore.  Right, right.  My legs are sore.  Your legs are sore and you don't want to get your pants dirty.  He said, why are your legs sore?  I'm like, well, I was squatting.  I didn't want to kneel and get my pants dirty.  He said, you'll tongue a stranger's balloon knot, but you won't kneel and get your pants dirty.  Oh, what are you going to go home and your mother's going to look into dirty pants?  Jim, were you in the park again?  So, I believe this story is all part of an unsolved rape in the park, too. 
[01:02:00]  And it just sounds like a crime.  A little wilding she was jogging.  It's a crime.  I picked up two girls after a show, right?  Well, I met two girls.  So, I call Norton.  He's working in another club in New York.  And one was maybe a three.  Oh, yeah.  These two goddamn guys.  Was I on that show with you?  No, no.  You were across town at the haunted house over on First Avenue. 
[01:02:30]  And so, I call.  They got a room at the Marriott Marquis, right?  I go, Jim, I got these two ladies I met after the show.  They want to hang out.  He got over there quicker.  I mean, he flew over.  So, we go up to the hotel.  This girl was like a three.  And the other one looked like a...  There was a decimal point.  The three was the hot one.  It was awful.  So, what did you think when you walked in and looked at the girl?  I was expecting American Indians to chase them with a spear. 
[01:03:00]  They were horrible.  Right.  Really?  She had to thank Greenpeace.  I almost carved my initials in her.  She was a fat...  They were awful looking.  Wow.  So, excuse me.  I'm in the bathroom with one.  Right?  And I got the other one.  I'm on the bathroom with...  The one's like a three or four.  That's how I'm in the bathroom with her.  What a classic!  I'm in the bathroom.  Yeah.  I've changed.  I make a good voice right now.  But...  So, I'm in the bathroom with her.  And we're fooling around.  Of course.  And she's doing to me what Norton did in the park. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, my God.  The rusty trombone she's giving you.  Yeah.  With her trombone.  Yeah.  That's when you're licking the balloon out.  And then you get the reach around and start...  Oh, really?  Well, so she's doing that.  So, the other girl...  Oh, my God.  Zero.  The negative two wouldn't have anything to do with Norton.  And you would think...  Oh, really?  That'd be three and Nura one.  Right?  She wouldn't have anything to do with you?  No.  She was fat and awful.  And I'm laying on my back on the bed.  And she's kind of like riding on me with clothes on. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  And she was horrendous.  But she wouldn't go any farther.  So, okay.  So, the other one...  We come out of the bathroom.  I finish.  And I said, look.  My friend just got out of prison or rehab.  I said something.  I go, he hasn't been with a girl for a while.  Oh, God.  Can you hook him up a little?  Hook him up a little.  Let's have a cigarette first.  You are so generous.  So, he goes into the bathroom with her.  Comes out.  Whatever.  And we're leaving.  Again, I go, so you have a good time?  He goes, yeah.  I go, well, did you make out with her?  I go, yeah.  I go, oh, no. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, no.  And then you learn.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that was true.  Oh.  Did you notice a fragrance?  I had no, no, no, no.  So, that thing under his tongue is my baby seat.  Oh, God.  I didn't know.  She was licking balloon mouth.  Yeah, apparently for a while. 
[01:05:00]  You always know you're in for a classy evening when you walk in and the girl's sitting on the toilet finishing a cigarette.  And I did a mule release, and believe me, pow, right to it.  And well, I might have.  Really well.  Yeah, I had no idea.  He said, did you make out with her?  I'm like, yeah.  And he's like, dude, she ate.  I'm like, ah.  Yeah.  You don't have any emails I get what a pig I am every time I tell these stories.  But, you know.  It hurts with girls.  To be able to think, I'll beat a comic and let's get laid a lot.  Uh-uh. 
[01:05:30]  Musicians get laid a lot.  Comedians tell stories like this, and women want nothing to do with you.  Well, it just sounds like there was a lot of action going on.  It doesn't sound like you're really hurting for...  Not at all.  But they think you're a pig.  Yeah.  Well, you are.  Listen to these stories.  What?  Little two men having to share and a lady on the turtlet?  On the turtlet.  Yeah.  Just a girl and a turtlet.  If you're not licking chocolate out of it, you might as well help a couple comics out.  You offended Boston whore, I hope you're dead.  Oh, yeah.  That's where we started with this. 
[01:06:00]  Right.  All right.  We'll continue.  Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate?  Let me adjust my tie and type this out.  Are you ribbing us?  Oh, golly.  Good gravy.  Shapers, creepers.  Put the meat in our races.  Oh, my God.  Oh, brother.  Go f*** yourself.  Tasteless offensive.  Oh.  I need drugs.  Sucks on a daily basis.  White pussy boy suburban humor.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Aren't we supposed to be trying to gain listeners, guys? 
[01:06:30]  No!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Is that a surprise to you?  Yeah.  Big story in the news. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, my God.  I sure hope this isn't completely true, and I hope Tom decides to stay on board a little  longer.  Well, Tom Brokaw, thinking about retiring, Anthony.  His contract is up, what, in the summer?  He's not sure, and he's not sure if he's going to continue.  I'm not going to re-sign until I'm syndicated in 22 markets.  My contract is up.  I want to be on YSP in Philly.  Oh, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[01:07:30]  Can't they move someone aside and put me, Tom Brokaw, in at YSP in Philly?  Shouldn't I be able to do that?  I'd be willing to change my slot here at NBC Nightly News if I could maybe get nights over  in YSP in Philly.  Come on.  It's a joke.  Shut up.  I understand.  So, he might leave.  Ah, you know what?  This is hogwash.  You think it's hogwash?  It's hogwash. 
[01:08:00]  How old is that saying?  Hogwash comes from, like, the 40s, I think.  Ah, is it?  It's right up there with poppycock.  Take your hands off the white lady, boy.  Hogwash.  Don't cut him down until they get the message.  He's going to continue.  But, more importantly, there's some other things in this article, right?  Well, Tom, not one to sit on his laurels.  He's doing things. 
[01:08:30]  He's got some ball.  And this is directly related.  He's making a difference.  You know what this is?  He's trying to compete with Dan Rather again.  Competing with Dan Rather.  If you remember, a little while back, Dan Rather had a run-in in Afghanistan where, I  believe, a bomb went off, and he was in a car caravan, and he was very close to the action.  He got on the news that night and did great in the ratings because he was almost killed.  Right.  Well, Tom Brokaw, not to be outdone, it seems he's doing a special aboard the Stennis, the 
[01:09:00]  USS Stennis, the aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea.  And Tom Brokaw took a flight in an F-14 over Afghanistan on a mission.  These news guys.  Meanwhile, Peter Jennings, that pussy, just sits there and does nothing.  He's not.  Where is he?  He's not going to ruin his pretty face, Anthony.  I have to put my ass on the line every day in order to get ratings for NBC Nightly News. 
[01:09:30]  I have to cover up.  I have to make good because of this speech impediment.  So now I'm going on bombing mission.  Yeah, there's a tough word.  I'm an anchorman on a bombing mission.  There's a tough word in this article here.  Where is that word?  Where was it from earlier?  Well, that's where he was talking about staying on.  Oh, he did state that he is not a megalomaniacal. 
[01:10:00]  What?  He's not megalomaniacal.  Megalomaniacal.  Meg.  Hold on.  Let me pour out a big glass of scotch.  What's that word, Tom?  Tom Brokaw saying that I'm not a megalomaniacal like you.  Megalomaniacal.  Megalomaniacal.  Megalomaniacal. 
[01:10:30]  What the hell is the word?  Meg.  I'm not Meg Griffin, the old DJ.  No, no, no, no, no.  I would not be so bold or a megalomaniacal to suggest that if I go away, all goes to hell.  Well, Brokaw says, I would not be so bold or megalomaniacal.  That's what I said. 
[01:11:00]  Megalomaniacal.  So, Tom, you're flying the F-14s over Afghanistan, huh?  I'm a fighter jock.  Highway to the danger zone.  Take me right into the danger zone.  Here I am in my F-14.  Hey, Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get in here anyway?  The list is long but distinguished.  Yeah, well, so is my Johnson.  Where's Iceman? 
[01:11:30]  You could be my wingman anytime.  Oh, you're damn right.  Highway to the danger zone.  Look at this, Goose.  This is what I call a target-rich environment.  Look at all the poons hanging around here.  A spider jock.  Get all the good chicks.  I believe she's lost that loving feeling.  Oh, she has?  I hate it when she does that.  I feel the need.  The need for speed.  You feel the need for speed? 
[01:12:00]  The need for speed.  Rather, you're a pussy.  You could be my wingman, Rather.  Look, it's Viper and Rather in that plane.  In training, remember, the hard deck is at 5,000 feet.  Don't go below, below, below.  Don't go underneath it.  You can keep it.  Top Gun rules of engagement are written for your safety and that of your team.  They're not flexible, nor am I.  Am I clear on this?  Hey, Rather, nice pictures you took of that rig. 
[01:12:30]  I've seen Rather fly.  His ego's riding checks his body.  Cash count.  Cash count.  Cash.  What?  I can't even say it.  God, I suck.  Tom, do the Top Gun.  Uh-oh, too close for missiles.  I'm switching to guns. 
[01:13:00]  Take that, you commie mig.  They're all over me.  Goose.  Check our sticks.  That's right.  Your ego's riding checks your body can't cash.  I know.  Shut up.  It was written on nice.  Real nice.  It's not good. 
[01:13:30]  Brokaw, engage.  No, it's not good.  I'm coming back to base.  I'm on ready five.  Holy S, it's Viper.  Viper's up here.  Great.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Go screw Jester.  Hey, let's, let's buzz the tower. 
[01:14:00]  Anymore when I kiss your mouth.  And there's no, come on, sing with me, Goose.  Right up until you die.  Goose's head hit the canopy.  Goose's head hit the canopy.  Yeah.  Poor Meg Ryan.  That's the show is.  And if you screw this up, you'll be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog crap out of 
[01:14:30]  a hot car.  Everybody, come on, right over there.  You've lost that feeling.  Whoa.  That affectionate feeling.  You've lost a holy feeling  Now it's gone  Take me to bed or it'll lose me forever  I'm not going to sit here and blow sunshine up your butt, Lieutenant 
[01:15:00]  And then poor Goose died and became a doctor with a brain tumor on the ER  After he went through that nerdy phase  Tom Brokaw, Top Gun, NBC Nightly News  Feel like  Baby  Baby  Take my breath away  Here's where I hop on my motorcycle

Ten-year-old female monkey puffs on a cigarette  At a temple west of Bangkok  She took up the habit despite apparently being underage

[01:22:30]  Well, I'm not  And Anthony shouldn't either  I'm trying to keep this clean today  Damn you all to hell  We're talking about  Anthony, you look like this monkey  We're talking about cigarettes still, right?  I think so  Okay  I don't want them  Damn you all to hell  I don't want them to be confused down the hall  And think that we're talking about something else here  Between the cigarettes, the jerky boys  John Heston and QVC guy  I'm not going to be able to talk for a week 
[01:23:00]  Damn you  Come on, horse, get me out of here  Alright, get out of here  I need a cigarette  Alright, get out of here  Damn you all to hell  There he goes on his little horse  Chuck Heston  Look at him go  Have a 7-up  The Opie and Anthony Show  It's like listening to Corky and Cara Ann Quinlan  Opie and Anthony  I'd rather hear my penis in a place than listen to those jokes  The Opie and Anthony Show 
[01:23:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show  1027  WNEW  Let's take a trip to the moon, baby  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show  Give us a call in the New York area  877-692-1027  Anywhere else  866-2774  Wow  Wow  Oh my god 
[01:24:00]  Going old school  Yeah  I do believe that means we're going to be talking about Nixon again  Well, back in the notes  The guy dead how long?  How long has Nixon been dead?  I guess 10 years now  Yeah  Right  About that, I guess  It was in the 90s, right? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah  I don't know  But, you know  He's still in the news  What do we got here?  It seems they found more tapes  Well, isn't it the same tapes  But they were bored  With playing the same stuff over and over again  And decided to see what else was on those tapes?  Yeah  Alright  So they got all of the tapes  And now they're pouring through them  Looking for some funny stuff  And they keep finding it 
[01:25:00]  By gosh  It says the latest tapes  Of Richard Nixon  It says he's got a problem with pot smokers  Of course, the ever-present Jews  That he has a problem with  And now the gays  He's got a little problem with the gays open  Here's some of his  Some of his rant about 
[01:25:30]  Pot and Jews  From 71  He actually said  You know, it's a funny thing  Every one of the bastards  Are out to legalize marijuana  They're all Jewish  What the Christ  Is the matter with the Jews, Bob?  What's the matter with them?  I suppose it's because  Most of them are psychiatrists  Those damn psychiatrists 
[01:26:00]  This guy was running the country  Yeah  He's sitting down with Billy Graham  Talking about how the Jews  Are in control of the media  But then there he is  Saying how most of the Jews  Are psychiatrists  It doesn't seem very consistent, Opie  No, not at all  He explains other things  In these drug tapes  Including the  Insidious nexus between drugs  Homosexuality  Communism  And of course  Jews 
[01:26:30]  The excerpts begin with  Nixon's doctrine on  Why marijuana is worse than alcohol  It's because  People drink to have fun  They smoke marijuana  To get high  Wasn't that the same thing?  Well, not to Richard Milhouse Nixon  For some reason  There's a big difference  Between drinking to have fun  And smoking marijuana to get high  Right  He repeats it twice  But when you get high  Don't you have fun? 
[01:27:00]  It doesn't matter  Alright  The difference between pot and drinking  Is you drink to have fun  You smoke pot to get high  Alright  There's a difference  Don't prod me with this  In an excruciating sequence  From September 9th, 71  Nixon is meeting with  Former Pennsylvania governor  Raymond Schaefer  Raymond Schaefer  Schaefer heads a presidential commission  On drug policy  That Nixon has heard  Might be flirting with  The notion of recommending  Decriminalizing pot  You're enough of a pro 
[01:27:30]  Nixon says  To know that  For you to come out  With something  That would run counter  To what the congress feels  And what the country feels  And what we're planning to do  Would make your commission  Look bad as hell  He was very upset  With this guy  Trying to legalize pot  As an old prosecutor  I don't mind putting  It in J. Edgar Hoover's hands  But what in J. Edgar Hoover's hands 
[01:28:00]  As far as I know  I heard the story  J. Edgar Hoover  Liked having man junk  In his hands  He says  I'd rather put it  In his hands  Than a bunch of  Muddle-headed  Psychiatrists  In other words  The Jews  He said  Everyone was soft  On drugs  In the commission  Because apparently  It's filled with  You know  Psychiatrists  Those  Hook-nose  Steaming  Psychiatrists 
[01:28:30]  Those  Money-grubbing  Psychiatrists  They're all  Muddle-headed  You know what I mean  That's what he said  Muddle-headed  Muddle-headed  Yeah  Remember that word  For the Oz game  Rick  Okay  As they're listening  To the tapes  They say  The discomfort  Is palpable  You could hear him  Hooking his finger  Into his collar  Like this is how  Uncomfortable it is  To be in the presence  Of the president  Of the United States  As he's being 
[01:29:00]  A lunatic  He was very upset  With the pot line  And anything to do  With legalizing pot  Then he goes off  Opie on the gays  The scourge  Of homosexuality  Nixon expands  On his lengthy monologue  In 71  Making it clear  He doesn't like  Gay people  Northern California 
[01:29:30]  He says  Has gotten so faggy  That I won't  Shake hands  At anyone  In San Francisco  He wouldn't  Shake hands  He wouldn't  Shake hands  At anyone  I don't care  That the age  Is years away  Tricky dick knows  Don't shake hands  With the faggy  People in Frisco  It's raining men  Hallelujah  It's raining men  Bang bang bang  Bang bang bang  Bang bang 
[01:30:00]  Keep the fags  Away from me  He wouldn't shake hands  With anyone  In Frisco  Because it was  Getting too faggy  Alright  Yeah  Oop oop  Oop oop  What sauce is that?  Nixon loves this subject  It says  He's nearly unstoppable  On it  His top aides  H.R. Bob Haldeman  And John Ehrlichman  Are in the room  But they barely speak  Beyond monosyllabic  Syllabic  Little  Little tastes 
[01:30:30]  Of a conversation  It takes the president  A while  To get to the point  It's raining men  Hallelujah  It's raining men  Come on Bob  Haldeman  Ehrlichman  Get in here  Where's my Jew boys  Get Ben Stein in here  Ben you psychiatrist  Whip it out  You kike fag  Shake that ass  Haldeman  Bring Ehrlichman 
[01:31:00]  And the other  Hebe in here  I want a threesome  It's raining fags  Where's Henry Kissinger  Hey peacemaker  Pull out your junk  I love a fat Jew hog  I like them cut  I like them cut bob  I don't like them  Looking like a cannoli  This was all in the article 
[01:31:30]  And  Yeah  Woo it's raining fags  It's raining men  Bring me a fresh  Young Jaime Ben  Ben Stein  And it's part by speech  Write me a speech  Where I can denounce the fags  Without sounding like  I'm against them  No one can know  The real Tricky Dick  I have  Tricky Dick  As a name  That's what I said 
[01:32:00]  Wait he starts talking about  A TV sitcom  He loves the subject  Of gays  Yeah  And he goes on  Talking about them  And Haldeman and Ehrlichman  Are in the room  All nervous  Not talking  Because they know  He's a kook  So he starts talking about  A sitcom of the day  You might know it  All in the family  Here's his little  Comment on the show  Archie's sitting there  And he said this  This is on the tape  Right  Archie's sitting there  With his hippie son-in-law  Married to the screwball daughter 
[01:32:30]  The son-in-law appears to go both ways  The guy writing this  Nixon seems to have concluded  Against all evidence  That meatheads are bisexual  Possibly  How about less TV  And you know  Pay attention to the country  Right  At that point  I think reviewing  All in the family  Meathead  He had meat in his head  Who has meats  In their head Bob  The fags  Other men's meat 
[01:33:00]  Possibly it was  The length of his hair  Another character  On the show  Nixon reports  Is obviously queer  He says  He wears an ascot  And so forth  Well he's right there  I've never seen a straight guy  Wearing an ascot  Name one  An ascot  Oh  How does that front hop  Exactly  Liddy  Break into my bonnocks 
[01:33:30]  Like you did the water gate  It's raining jizz  And when I want a little chocolate man love  I go over to the Jefferson  The president is outraged  The president is outraged  At this filth  That it should appear on TV  Right  To the point that  Oh this is what he said  The point that I make is that  God damn it  I do not think you glorify 
[01:34:00]  On public television  Homosexuality  You don't glorify it John  Any more than you glorify it on the  Whores  That's what he said  Three's company  A fag and two whores  Look at the show  Jack Tripper  Obviously a fag  He's got two  Beautiful women  And he never  F***s them  Not once Bob  Cause he's a 
[01:34:30]  F***ing fag  And then Furly's the gay guy  Furly fag  So Jack Tripper  And then you got the two girls  The blonde and the brunette  The whores  The whores Bob  You don't glorify this on television  Jack Tripper should be  F***ing them  Cause I don't want fags on TV  But if he's f***ing two women  That means they're whores  And I don't want f***ing whores on television  What the country wants me dead 
[01:35:00]  Who cares  I'm reviewing sitcom  My three sons  Is even the father  Who are groping these young boys  My three f***ing fags  It was Uncle Charlie  Adam 12  Twelve boys named Adam  What was it about  Medical center  Handling the AIDS virus  I know it's not out yet  But it's coming  Nixon knows  And don't get me into the Brady punch 
[01:35:30]  The father's f***ing the children  Oh come on  He is  I talked to Greg Brady  On the Opie and Anthony show  Mayberry RFD  RFD stands for  Ram your f***ing  F***ing me  In me  Flip Wilson  Another word for a  F***ing  Bonanza 
[01:36:00]  Sounds like boner  What about  Fantasy Island  The love boat  I think I had already  Been kicked out of all  Of this  But we could use  Some liberties  Don't get me started  On a show like  The Dick Van Dyke show  It's got Dick and Dyke  What about  Leave it to Beaver  Leave it to Beaver  Here's one  At least it's  Conventional sex  But I  I seem to believe  Beaver has something  To do with horse  And Bob 
[01:36:30]  I don't like horse  Canon  You know what a  Canon is  Yes  Another word for a  Big large  Usually on a  Black man  Those spooks  Have big ones  Bob  The spooks  Got big  Bob  Well that's a  Stereotype sir  I don't care what it is  Nixon knows  The stereotype  The black man  Doesn't mind  Alright go ahead  Oh there's more  Yeah  Well it gets  The ascot  Right right  No offense to you 
[01:37:00]  Because that's  Some funny stuff  But it's even  Funnier in the  In the print here  The president  Asserts that  America is in  Jeopardy  From the Archie  Bunker  Gay thing  I don't want to  See this country  Go that way  You know what  Happened to the  Greeks Bob  Homosexuality  Destroyed them  He did not  Say it  He said it  Listen to this  Sure  Aristotle was a  Homo  We all know that  So was Socrates  He said 
[01:37:30]  Aristotle was a  Homo  That's a quote  That's a quote  We all know that  How do we know that  We know  You know what the  Greeks are about  Sex  Sex day and night  You make the bang bang bang  Apparently Aristotle and  Socrates were gay  That's right 
[01:38:00]  Come on Henry  Dance with me  Here we go  Come on Bob  Wake me up  And let's go  Homo  We'll be like  Socrates and  Aristotle  Wake me up  We'll both  Go homo  Wake me up  Me off  When we go  Homo  Me off  We'll go  Homo  Bob let me  Assert you  That  Jesus Christ 
[01:38:30]  Was a fag  With his long hair  But he's better  Than the Jews  Yeah  Yeah  Woo  Ho ho  Alright it gets better  Because now he talks about the Romans  Yes  Ehrlichman interrupts to reassure his boss  Socrates he says  Never had the influence that television had  Can you just believe these men  The most powerful men in the world  Having this conversation  And putting it on tape 
[01:39:00]  So Ehrlichman says  Socrates never had that influence  And Nixon jumps in  Precisely  Precisely  Nixon's on a roll  Lecturing like a history professor  Do you know what happened to the Romans  Oh no  Here we go  These are quotes  The last six Roman emperors were fags  How the F does he know that  Spaniard  Spaniard  F*** me  Come on Henry Kissinger 
[01:39:30]  Grab your hook friends  Let's dance  And have gay sex like Socrates  I'll be Aristotle  You be Socrates  F*** me  F*** Nixon hard  Where's Pat with her one breast  Wait he talks about the popes next  You know Pat only had one breast  I used to try to

[01:40:30]  Yeah the Romans  All the  The last six emperors  Are fags  Yeah  You know what happened to the people  Not to the popes  To the popes  A misprint  Okay  It's alright that popes  Were laying the nuns  Roman emperors  Fags  Popes laying nuns  He had to be high  He had to be high  Someone laughs nervously  Nixon bulls on  Not a hint of humor  In his voice  That's been going on  For years 
[01:41:00]  Centuries  But when the popes  When the catholic church  Went to hell  In I don't know  Three or four centuries ago  It was  Homosexual  The whole church was homo  The Romans homo  The Greeks homo  Meathead homo  The guy with the ascot homo  Aha  Now that's what happened  To Britain  It happened earlier to France

[01:56:30]  They just said that  The evidence was tainted  And um  He might not have  Uh committed this crime  That he spent 20 years  In prison for  Murder  But the movie  Kind of  It turns kind of  Wacky  Like there's these  Canadian white people  Real liberal whitey  That uh  Scoop up this  Black kid from  Brooklyn  To educate him  And they're teaching him  And this black kid  From Brooklyn  Now living in Toronto  Writes to a hurricane  In prison  The hurricane's  Inspired by the letter  Writes back to him

You're wanted  I'm wanted  Alright  Like colon cancer 
[02:24:00]  The Opie and Anthony show  For the kids  The kids out there  Yeah because  You guys know  That I do a lot of  Elementary schools  I do  I like to come in  Sing some cute little songs  To the kids  Sure  You and Barney  One thing I feel  Is that  I really need to stress  To the kids  That they can be  Anything they want  When they grow up  And I tell them  No I'm serious  They can be doctors  Or lawyers  And I say it's fun 
[02:24:30]  To use your imagination  So I tell the kids  That they can  They can be a superhero  If they want  Oh very nice  Any kind of superhero  They want  They can even make up  Their very own superheroes  Okay  So I play this  This is for all the kids  Seriously  If there's kids listening  It's just for them  This is really not for adults  If I could be  A superhero  I would be  Awesome man  I'd fly around  The world  Fighting crime  According to my 
[02:25:00]  Awesome plan  And if I saw  Criminals  Trying to lie  Hurting other people  And making them cry  I'd haul them off  To jail  In my  Awesome van  Cause I would be  Awesome man  Yeah  Then I say kids  Now you know  We all know  That when people  Offer you drugs  And alcohol  Like me  You just say no  Right  If I could be  A superhero 
[02:25:30]  I would be  Drug free boy  Telling the world  Of the evils  Of drugs  And all of the lives  They destroy  Well I'd take  All the junkies  Getting so high  With their needles  And bongs  And their sticks  Made of Thai  As I burn them alive  I would squeal  With joy  Cause I would be  Drug free boy  If I could be 
[02:26:00]  A superhero  I'd be  Immigration dude  I'd send all the  Foreigners back  To their homes  For eating up  All of our food  And taking our  Welfare and best  Jobs to boot  Like landscaping  Dishwashing  Picking our fruit  I'd pass a lot  Of laws  To get rid  Of their brood  Cause I'd be  Immigration dude 
[02:26:30]  I have the kids  Imagine what  Superhero  They would be  They could be  Any superhero  If you could be  A superhero  Would you be  Justice guy  Making sure  People get  What they deserve  Especially  Women who lie  Like if a wife  Left her husband  With three kids  And no job  To run off  To f***ing  Why with some  Doctor named Bob  You could skin them 
[02:27:00]  And drain them  Of blood  So they'd die  Especially Bob  Then you would be  Justice guy  Or you could be  More subtle  I didn't mean  To be vague  Give her  The mad cow disease  Let him die  Of the plague  As long as they  Suffered for their  Horrible lie  Especially Bob  Then you would be  Justice guy  Yes then you would be  A superhero

[02:31:00]  Alright  Barry crashes  Through the door  My manager  Barry Katz  Uh huh  And says  Jay what the heck  Are you doing  You're on the air  In five seconds  I say well  I thought I'd relax  By getting a massage  From the ESPN  Masseuses  Played by you  And Anthony  You and Opie  So hold on  Let me finish  Let me finish  You're dressed in  All white  Like the good humor  Man  But you're real  Masseuses  Okay  Hold on  Wait  Wait  No  No  Hold on

[02:32:00]  I thought I'd relax  Before the monologue  By getting a nice  Massage  From the ESPN  Masseuse  Uh huh  Barry looks at me  And says  Jay ESPN  Doesn't have  Masseuses  Oh  Then I look at  You two guys  And then you two guys  Just basically say  Hey  We just wanted to  Meet Ozzy  And you pack up  And you leave  And I look at Barry  And I say  We tell no one  Okay  Terrific  Now I knew  You would have  Drop that out of me  Every matter 
[02:32:30]  Time  You bastard  So again  You just don't want to play  A guy that would  Massage another guy  Again  I must say  We are massaging  Jay Moore  Stupid  Are you kidding me  I will say this  Yeah  The marijuana intake  When I thought of that idea  Yeah  Might have  Might have been  A little greater than normal  Oh jeez  I don't want to get the H  Fellas  But Opie's still laughing  I am laughing 
[02:33:00]  Three days later  I am laughing  Now  And Opie  Yes  Has been laughing  For three days  So  What part of  Is it supposed to be sexy  What part of your body  Are we massaging  Good question  Like it matters  In the script  That was actually written up  Yeah  Because I told my writers  To get this on the fast track  Right  For the sole purpose  We have to get Opie and Anthony  On television  Uh huh  I believe you move  From my thigh 
[02:33:30]  To my calf  You're insane  Your legs  My legs  I don't need to be  But you're real  But look  You're not gay  You just want to  To meet Ozzy  I don't  I don't  I don't  Want to be on TV  That bad  Hey  But you know what gentlemen  We're talking about it  Which is a good thing  We're going to make it happen  They're all pink  On the inside  That's one way  To look at it  So  If we're working  As that is the 
[02:34:00]  Worst case scenario  Right  We're going to come up  With madcap fun  For the three of us  To get down  You stupid  Faggot  So who has to  Massage the thigh  And who gets to  Massage the calf  Because I'm thinking  If I'm massaging the calf  It's less gay at least  Well I thought  Only Anthony  Would massage me  And Opie would be  Sort of an instructor  Telling you  Oh yeah  Saying okay  That's nice  Quadricep  Make sure you get all four  That's why it's called  A quad  And Anthony says  Right 
[02:34:30]  Got it  You can act like a man  Get on your knees  And bang like a dog  It's what I do  It's all I do  Why don't you get  Dice to massage you  Look what he's doing now  Now look at me  Look what he's doing now  Now look at me  Stupid  Norton  What do you think  Of that idea  Dude  Just to meet Ozzy  I don't know man  If it's a sketch  Doesn't go in real life  I'll give you a hummer  If you can put me  In a scene with him  You can't say that 
[02:35:00]  I'm not going to  Deny that it's gay  It's funny though  Eric on line 7  Goes  Did Jay just  Come out of the closet  Opie's still laughing  At the thought of  Anthony massaging my thigh  Don't just stare at him  I was laughing so hard  The other night  Because I know  You know  How Ant would react  To something like that  He doesn't even  Shake your hands  Oh Anthony  That guy that said  That thing in the post  About what you were worth  Is that all resolved  Oh yeah 
[02:35:30]  That's taken care of  Dominic Barber  I wish I was your lawyer  Really  Oh god  Every time the guy  Opened his mouth  I would just look at the jury  And go  100 million  Everything this guy says  Started with him  Publicly saying something  99 million away  From the truth  And he didn't call  The lawyer or the judge  He decided to take it  Publicly  To let you know  For the strict purpose  To mislead you  Consider the source  Yeah but  100 million  Jay Moore  Attorney at law 
[02:36:00]  I'd love to be an attorney  Wouldn't that be fun  Because you could say  Whatever you want  Just withdraw it  So I'd be like  Well she's a whore  Withdrawn  Never mind  Yeah yeah  That's what they do  She slept with Rick Delgado  We didn't know that  Withdrawn  And it's withdrawn  And it's withdrawn  It's not on the record  But you still said it  They still have it  In their heads  When they go into  That little room  And wonder if OJ  Killed people or not  People are now asking  Tom from Philly  Wants to know  If I have to give you  A happy ending  With the massage 
[02:36:30]  No  There is no pull release  Written into the sketch  But you know  And how naked are you  On this table  Good question Opie  How naked Jay  Let's try to see  If we can come  So you know  This is a good sign  Because we're working  Together for a happy medium  I just can't believe  Anthony didn't put  The kibosh on it  Right away  Oh he did  He just asked me  How dressed I was  So he's still thinking  About it  Opie asked how dressed  You are  No we're just trying  To get another  Five minutes out of this  For our show  Oh I will  Are you naked 
[02:37:00]  You got a towel on  Are you on your chest  Or on your back  It was good to beat  The show like  You know  I'd like to show  You know  Show off the pipes  A little bit  The pipes  All free  So you'll just have  Like a towel around your waist  No I think I'd probably  You know  Be in a robe  Will you be on your back  Oh my god  My wife last night  Told me I laugh  Like Burt Reynolds  And I think she's right  Uh oh  That's a bad news  Look now we're getting  People saying  Is Jay's new show  More sports  Or more fags 
[02:37:30]  Come on  This is just an idea  I had  And this is not  The type of threesome  Ant enjoys  But you know  The bottom line is  That was an idea  That's not going to  Take for you to  However  It's a cute idea  Is this  It's too fake  Just say it  It's too fake  He pitches something  That we're not going to do  So then the real pitch  Seems so doable  Right  Is that it Jay  You're a shrewd one  Well  Look 
[02:38:00]  You guys got to get on the show  We're going to get you on the show  I would be honored  To be honored  Everyone knows  Everyone that works here  Knows that you guys  Are eventually going to be  On this show  So you guys would  I would be honored  To have you guys on the show  Because it's what  We always talked about  What we would do  For one another  And I just think that's  You know  You got to do it  For your friends  You guys  Yeah but let's  A little less gay  A little less gay  A little less gay  Put it this way  Because of the gayness of it  I'd pass up the role  On your show  To do a cameo  On Oz  As some guy's prague 
[02:38:30]  Hey with Jim Brown  In jail  We could do  Celebrity Oz  Right now  Celebrity Oz  That's a funny idea  I asked one of the  Black guys in the office  I said how does he feel  About Jim Brown fasting  And he went  Yeah Jim Brown fast  Alright so something  Less gay  This is my second idea  Jay I have an idea  Something less gay  Maybe they can roll around  Make it on the floor  With Matthew Shepard  Oh god  Wow 
[02:39:00]  Now people are asking me  If I do it  If Jay was in the  Chris Walken character  You know what  Gay  That makes it less gay  No that's still gay  Let's hear the pitch  As Christopher Walken  Maybe something  Will come to light here  Sure  Look gentlemen  I appreciate  You giving me  A massage  Before my first show  You kept me  Pumped up  That's a little too hard  On my thigh  Thank you  But I am breathing  Look 
[02:39:30]  Gentlemen  I need a pull release  At the end  I need the early birth  Special  And go heavy  On the oil  And before you finish  I'm talking  To Anthony  Make sure  That  This watch  Find itself  In my  No I got a different  Anthony this one's  Just for you  Alright  Alright so this is  Idea number two  Okay  Number two  Here we go  Me and Anthony  In my office  At Moore Sports 
[02:40:00]  Are doing blow  Off Tara Reid's ass  Nice  Okay  So far I'm in  Anthony says  Alright  I'm all pumped up  Let's get to it  I look down  At my crotch  And I say  Uh oh  And then Opie  Comes in  And you guys  Just double  And then I go  And do the show  So you guys  We leave  America's left  With the impression  That you and Anthony  Not only are you 
[02:40:30]  Such good friends  And such good  Counterparts  And so good for  One another  On the air  As well as off the air  That when you fly  Coast to coast  To be on a friend show  That you guys  Are so cool  You actually have  Double  To a Tara Reid  We got to put  Tara Reid  On the rotisserie  Right  And I'm the one  That's worse for it  Because I already  Shot my pants  So that's the second idea  Right  AJ  As long as you don't  Combine the two ideas  And having you  Finish prematurely 
[02:41:00]  While I massage your leg  No no no  And this is  I didn't even get  To the third idea  Uh oh  There's a third idea  This is the best one  I like you finishing  While he's massaging  Your thigh  And in the credits  You see Anthony  With an eye patch  And then Anthony  Anthony says  We tell no one  Right  Alright  This is the new idea  This is the third one  That I think is the one  That's really going to  Put it over the top  Does it involve  Tara Reid again  No  Alright I'm out  It also does not  Involve Opie  Oh wow 
[02:41:30]  How does this happen  It's in a steam room  It's Opie  Jeff Garcia  And Cordell Stewart  No  Okay  Already no  Steam room  You're at Plato's Retreat  You're at Plato's Retreat  And you're the towel boy  Okay  Forget that then  Alright  No steam room  Cordell Stewart  Jeff Garcia  And Anthony  In the steam room  No one's touching each other  Right  Because that would be gay  Right  Yes 
[02:42:00]  If those three guys  Touched each other  One threw for 4,000 yards  And you know  One of those three  Isn't gay  So we're in the steam room  So Anthony  Cordell Stewart  And Jeff Garcia  In the steam room  Right  Okay  Okay  Oh god  Here we go  Okay  Now it's a sports show  You have to keep in mind  Uh huh  Greg Luganis enters  Who  I don't want to ruin it 
[02:42:30]  If I answer who  And he falls down  And splits his head  Wide open  Just to make it  A little more interesting  And everyone's down  Screaming  I don't want to get the age  Now that's funny  And then one of the three  Of Anthony  Cordell  Or Jeff  Says  Well I already have it  Ah there's the joke  I got nothing  I just wanted to hear  Anthony's reaction  To the massage skit  The massage skit  Is quite gay  When he told me this Friday  He was dead serious  Yeah  Yeah  But then you know what  When I slept on it  You know  It is like saying  Hey look 
[02:43:00]  We're his friends  And we massage his legs  Right  I say you put one  You have it yourself  On a table  With just a towel  Showing off that terrific body  And you have maybe  Opie on the feet  And Anthony on the shoulders  Or vice versa  You got to have one  On each end of you  And then what  What are you talking about  It goes wherever  It goes  It's even close  To that happening  I'm just saying  That's the massage  You get two massage  You don't want them  Both on the legs  You have one on the legs  And one on the shoulders  Well Jim  It's my sketch  My show  My massage  If I want four man hands  On my thigh  I'm going to get it  Theoretically  Opie could be on one leg
