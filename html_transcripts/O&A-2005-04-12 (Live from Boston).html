<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcast from the Paradise Lounge in Boston on XM202, was marked by a significantly smaller-than-expected audience (initially around 20, growing to roughly 30, including staff), a stark contrast to their previous day's performance at Fenway Park.  This low turnout became a recurring, humorous point of contention throughout the show. The hosts engaged extensively with the small, diverse audience (including women, underage attendees, and individuals from Vermont and New Jersey), often inquiring about their attendance and expectations.  A woman even flashed her breasts on stage at their request. The empty room's echo provided fodder for comedic routines.

The broadcast opened with a vulgar and suggestive exchange and a failed attempt to give away MiFi devices.  This was followed by a chaotic breakfast sandwich eating contest, fueled by numerous sandwiches (some half-eaten) collected from the audience.  The contest involved an impromptu arm-wrestling match to select contestants and was repeatedly interrupted by tangents, including discussions of a listener’s spider bite, a graphic description of a dental exam by Jimmy Norton, and extensive, explicit conversations about Wheelchair Fred.  Frank from Jersey, who had assisted Wheelchair Fred with a particularly messy incident in a motel bathroom involving a dildo, was interviewed, recounting the details in graphic terms.  The contest itself, featuring Vanessa, two Mikes, and Scott competing to eat eleven sandwiches in five minutes using copious amounts of ketchup, was a chaotic spectacle involving complaints about sandwich quality, near-vomiting, and the use of Wheelchair Fred's dildo as a prop.  Vanessa ultimately won.

The show featured phone calls, including one from Rich Vos (a studio guest) discussing his appearance on the Dennis Miller show and his best man duties at a wedding.  Another call was from "Pete from Connecticut" concerning "Frank from Jersey," who apparently spends his time cleaning up soiled bathrooms, leading to further discussion about Wheelchair Fred's substantial defecation in the studio bathroom.  A significant part of the broadcast involved further discussions of Wheelchair Fred's actions, detailed by Frank from Jersey,  and a photo incident where Frank's wife unwittingly wiped snot on her hand before shaking Anthony's hand.  The hosts also announced upcoming appearances by Kurt Long, Rich Voss, and Bob Kelly.  They gave away free breakfast sandwiches and discussed their planned appearance at a Bergada. The broadcast also included a listener call requesting a performance from Wheelchair Fred.

The show interspersed various audio clips, including one of an interview where someone (possibly Tom Sizemore) used the word "sissy" and was later shown crying in court, leading to speculation about acting.  A longer clip featured Tom Sizemore discussing his legal troubles, emotional distress, and financial needs.  This was followed by Jim Norton bits and Pat O’Brien material handled by an intern named Danny, prompting some expletive-laden exchanges between the hosts and the intern.  Kurt Long called in, discussing *Games Across America*, and Bob Kelly promoted his tour with Dave Cook.  Jim Norton recounted a graphic story of being caught masturbating by his girlfriend, followed by a humorous riff on the "nobody's home jerk," inspired by Chris Rock. The show included numerous other sexually explicit anecdotes and discussions, including graphic details of Jim Norton's experiences commuting on the Long Island Railroad and stories about Tracy Morgan's offensive behavior, concluding with plans for a post-show diner visit. The show ended with discussions of technical difficulties, a call from "Coot" from Alabama, and the playing of remixed audio clips of Michael Jackson discussing his genitals and Tom Sizemore's emotional court appearance.  The persistent theme of the low audience turnout and the upcoming move to a new studio underscored the entire broadcast.

[00:03:30]  The APNN Show, XM202.  The APNN Show, XM202.  The APNN Show, XM202.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  Pedophile humor.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The APNN.  The APNN.  The APNN.  The APNN.  God, that irritates me!  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Coffee.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  Don't do it!  It's terrible.  The APNN show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, yes. 
[00:04:30]  Well, we're on.  Hey, try not to trippy up with those big feet in the yard.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Day two in Boston in front of a lot of people. 
[00:05:00]  Wow.  Tens of drunks have come out today.  Tens of, yeah, losers.  Tens of hungover people.  Can we invite the homeless people in here so it looks like we have a crowd?  A little more.  Well, it's early, Opie.  I'm sure it'll pick up throughout the course of the broadcast.  Now, these guys are...  What are you people doing here?  We had to come here. 
[00:05:30]  We want to be on the Mass Pike already.  Oh, I was so going to just push the little OnStar button on the mirror.  Bling, OnStar.  Dial.  Opie.  And then it would have dialed you and I could have done the show from the Mass Pike.  I'm thinking we should do the last hour for the Mass Pike.  You want to do that?  We all just, you know, take off, call into the program with our cell phones.  Opie, I want to let the listeners know I'm cruising past Westboro right now. 
[00:06:00]  You know, something like that.  Why not?  That would be a good show.  This is our life, though.  Yesterday, we were feeling really good about ourselves.  We were at Fenway, Bill's Bar.  I mean, there was about a thousand fans there because they were coming and going the whole time.  That was crazy.  I mean, the place was packed the entire time.  People coming and going, getting drunk.  We're feeling like rock stars.  And then today, we feel like the schmucks that we really are.  We're in front of like 20 people, dude.  20 guys.  That's all right.  At least they're spread out.  They're not all at one table.  That would be really depressing. 
[00:06:30]  20 sociopaths looking at us.  We're too young to drink.  One group all came in the same car.  Great.  And we got two girls.  Is that what I'm looking at here?  Which means our odds are better than usual.  There you go.  Actually, three.  We have three girls here.  Yesterday, we were in front of 300, 400 people at any given moment.  And we had three or four girls there as well.  Three or four girls, yeah.  We're live at the Paradise Lounge in Boston.  And it's a legendary rock club.  And we're going to be doing the program from here.  Yes, we are.  We were like show prepping, and Norton's at a table with us, and he's looking around going, 
[00:07:00]  do you realize there are more posters up than people that are going to watch us today?  Yeah.  We've got a pretty big kick of them putting the plastic O&A cups behind the bar.  Because it's like, I think you can put some of the sleeves of those cups back in the boxes.  I think one sleeve is enough.  Yeah, yesterday they were running out of Opie and Anthony cups.  Those are the ones from Mardi Gras.  And today, I'm like, hey, everyone, take 20.  Take 20 with you.  Pass them out to your friends when you get out of here. 
[00:07:30]  That's the most depressing part about this day is that stack of lonely, untouched cups.  Oh, look at it.  At the end of that bar.  Look at them all there.  And you just know they will be right there, every single one of them, when we leave today.  We have to make eye contact with the staff on the way out.  I'm sorry, you didn't get up at 6 o'clock, didn't make shit today.  Apologize.  Oh, welcome, sir.  Hey, thanks for coming by.  How are you doing?  Cool.  Join your...  Find a seat.  It took that guy exactly 1.3 seconds to find a seat from the time he walked in the door. 
[00:08:00]  Yesterday, people were fighting for bar stools.  Oh, you couldn't even find one.  Sir, do you have 100 friends in the car and they're parking?  Yeah.  Are you the bus driver making sure it's cool to come in?  Oh, God.  And it just sucks doing a show in front of, like...  I'd rather do a show in front of 1,000 people instead of...  How many are...  I actually wouldn't.  Someone do a head count for us.  Yeah, do a head count.  Because we don't feel like...  Club soda Kenny, everyone.  Club soda Kenny.  Kenny, please do a count. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, I'll tell you because it...  And count the staff, please.  Don't forget Paul and Jaime.  Count everyone in this building.  Count the staff, because I think there's at least 10 or 12 that are working for the show right now.  We're going to pad the numbers a little bit with the staff.  I think when we do the show in front of a crowd like yesterday...  Oh, Kenny, don't forget me.  Yeah, even us.  Even us.  And you've got to count each caricature on the poster counts as one.  You've got a number already?  Yes.  The official count is 26 guests and 35 staff. 
[00:09:00]  There are not that many people in here.  You're a liar.  Well, Kenny's a true friend of the show.  You're a liar.  Yeah, it's either...  I either want like three people sitting behind the glass at the studio watching.  Right.  Where we don't really pay attention.  Right.  Or a crowd like yesterday.  Just mad men, savage animals.  Kenny.  But this is just a stare...  Let's just have a staring contest with the audience. 
[00:09:30]  Kenny, this is your...  Speaking of you, motherfuckers.  Kenny, this is your job today.  They could take pictures of us, but if they take a picture of the empty room, smash their cameras.  Okay.  All right?  Goddamn, FBI don't respect nothing.  I actually...  I kind of like this.  This is called taking lemons and making lemonade.  Making lemonade?  I kind of like this after yesterday.  You couldn't get anything done yesterday.  That is true.  And I want to tell the audience at home that the echo you're hearing isn't a technical glitch.  It's the old style echo of an empty room. 
[00:10:00]  That's supposed to be absorbed by bodies and ears.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's just...  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  It's just bouncing off walls now.  Yeah, this is a legendary rock club in Boston.  A lot of bands played on this stage that were sitting here.  Ben was very excited.  He came running up and saying, you two's first appearance in the United States at this very bar.  A lot of bands are playing here, including Spinal Tap today.  But we're going to make something of it, people. 
[00:10:30]  We don't want to disappoint the people that did show up, Opie.  They're already falling asleep.  You're here to see a live...  I wonder what they expect at a live performance.  Kenny, why don't you work the room and see what they expect from us today.  Now, yesterday...  I think we got a lot of interesting people in the room.  Yeah.  Look at it, Ken.  Because I know yesterday, we had a lot of people, and it was very much an Opie and Anthony  Rhodes show.  We had nudity.  We had gimps coming up on stage.  Freak shows.  We had a chick with no teeth. 
[00:11:00]  No teeth, but nice boobs.  What the hell was that about?  I don't know.  No, no.  Not nice boobs, Opie.  Oh, no?  No.  They were really bad.  Who was there?  They were nice.  That's another thing.  Who was there yesterday?  Two people.  Three guys.  So that means all these guys are underage, right?  Four.  That's the deal here, right?  You guys are all under 21?  Oh, there are some people...  Oh, this...  I gotcha.  Great.  Okay.  So what we're doing pretty much is babysitting today.  Your parents dropped you off, and they're picking you up after the show. 
[00:11:30]  Fantastic.  Yesterday, they got a taste of the road show.  You know, the nudity, the freaks, and everything like that.  And I think that might be what they're anticipating, or were anticipating, before they walked in.  And I don't know.  What are you...  Sir, sir, what are you expecting to see?  When you came here, what is your impression of a live Opie and Anthony show?  We know this guy.  He's a freak.  I'm expecting to see lots and lots of tits tonight.  All right.  Tits seem to be the good thing.  Well, we have six tits to choose from. 
[00:12:00]  Three girls.  Unless, of course, there was some medical problems.  That's right.  Or eight, if you include me.  I've already seen hers, so...  Yeah.  You've already seen hers?  Yes.  That's my girlfriend.  Oh, she's very lovely.  Can we see hers?  How old is she?  Nineteen.  Nineteen?  That's old enough.  That's old enough.  Teen.  Teen.  Teen.  Teen boobs.  Do you want to see my chest?  Teen boobs.  If you could throw out the first, wow, that would be fantastic.  Maybe we could just have an orgy here today.  Wow, she's a good sport.  Hey, look at that.  All right.  You got it. 
[00:12:30]  Did you guys all say?  That's wonderful.  All right.  Come center and stay.  You all better.  Yeah, good.  Give a little.  Give a little show.  She's up on the stage here.  Introduce yourself, little lady.  My name's Vanessa.  Hi, Vanessa.  I'm from Hingham.  Nineteen.  Hi, everyone.  Nineteen.  You guys better do.  Stand up.  Stand up.  Teen.  Wow.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  All right.  She's flashing.  I love this already.  We're all friends.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you very much.  There we go.  Okay.  Ooh.  A little flash going off.  Thank you, miss.  We'll have that on the web later today. 
[00:13:00]  Could you, Opie, could you check that off of our checklist?  We've gotten through a wow.  Okay.  All right.  Unbelievable.  That's what they're expecting.  Well, that was good.  The guy was expecting a wow, and he got to see his girlfriend's tits.  Fantastic.  All right.  Kenny, you know, work the room.  I want to see what these guys are expecting today.  Yeah, what they're expecting, why they're here.  Next door on the back, by the way, you look a lot like my sister.  The girl with the glasses.  What's your name? 
[00:13:30]  Well, Kenny will get to her, dude.  Kenny's over here.  But I'm talking to this guy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Kenny, go ahead.  Perfectly fine.  I drove from Vermont, left at 2 a.m., believe it or not.  Wow.  You left at 2 in the morning.  I'm the guy listening up in Vermont.  I think I'm the only one.  Vermont?  I haven't had anyone else yet.  No, we're very popular up in Vermont.  And I'm from Edison, New Jersey, Jimmy.  Oh.  That's where I was born.  Oh, me too.  No one cares.  I know.  That's why I said it.  Anthony?  Yes.  I think every person needs to say hi on the radio today.  You want to actually say hi to everybody in the room?  Why not?  It'll take us three minutes.  And where they're from. 
[00:14:00]  How you doing?  Mike D.  I'm from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.  Shrewsbury.  The home of Morocco, dude.  Nice.  Okay.  And why?  All right.  Why were you late, sir?  Sorry.  I overslept.  That's no excuse.  Sorry about that.  Bad classroom.  What's your name?  Chris.  Do some push-ups in front of the crowd.  All right.  How many do you want him to do?  Go.  He's actually doing it.  Yeah.  No one says no to Kenny.  That kid's got a body.  I'll say.  Hey, we got some stragglers, Kenny. 
[00:14:30]  Jesus.  Why are you late, sir?  No reason.  Speak.  It's a show.  There's no reason.  No reason.  Hey, they're starting to come in.  Kenny, can you not scare the audience?  You need to do sit-ups.  Sir, why are you late?  Welcome.  Well, the train was a little bit delayed.  I'm here now.  All right.  Come right in.  What's your story?  The dot-head who drove the bus was late.  Racist.  The dot-head who drove the bus was late. 
[00:15:00]  He said, all right.  They're starting to come in.  Nice cheeks.  We might have 50 people by the end of this.  Yeah, people are filing in.  All right, Kenny, work the back of the room a little bit here.  Oh, okay.  Get a different location.  What's your name, Toots?  Toots.  1945.  That's the rest of Ash.  Yeah, that was like a nice thing.  I don't think so.  Toots?  All right.  Why is Toots a bad term?  The skirt's got an attitude.  The skirt.  All right, work the room there, Kenny. 
[00:15:30]  Who else do we have?  Going toward the...  Here's a motley crew back here.  Okay.  Hi, my name's Arlie.  And why are you here, bro?  I live two blocks away.  I have nothing else to do.  Good.  Two blocks away, nothing else to do.  From Vermont and two blocks away, we're covering the whole fucking region.  Hey, good morning, Starshine.  I just want to give a shout-out to Paul.  He's living in his grandma's basement, and he wants to go back to Staten Island.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, fella.  Did he call him Stunshine, by the way? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, he kind of screwed that up.  Oh, Stunshine.  It's a little bit early, though.  Yeah, you tripped up.  Yeah, I'm covering him from Pembroke.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, I just came up to see a show live for once.  Cool.  Yeah, well, you picked a good one.  He's got a lot of energy, too, this guy.  Oh, everyone does.  Hey, Kenny, lock the door so no one can leave.  All right.  If these people start leaving, we're going to be in deep trouble.  Hi, I'm Lindsay.  It's my birthday today.  Oh!  Happy birthday.  Oh, you're the one that looks like Jimmy's sister.  I see it, Jimmy.  Yeah, she does.  Happy birthday.  I'm real honored to look like someone who is related to Jimmy. 
[00:16:30]  That's a real...  Oh, thank you.  Oh, old.  How old are you?  I'm 20.  Oh, that's cool.  20.  She was 19 yesterday.  Could you flash?  That's right.  That's true.  Maybe in a little bit.  I want to see how much you look like my sister.  There you go.  I think Jimmy should give her some birthday wax.  Oh, 20.  Are you...  Um...  You're freaking out a little bit?  You're not a teen anymore?  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  Two...  Just...  What was it?  About two hours ago, I was a teen.  You were a teen two hours ago.  Now your teenhood is just behind you.  Oh, you're over the hill.  Two hours ago?  What is your day...  How come your day starts at five?  It doesn't start at midnight like the rest of us?  What are you, from Australia?  Well, I was born at five in the morning, so...  Oh, she really hasn't figured out.  She's one of those.  I write Tina technical.  Oh, my God.  All right, well, we're here and we'll do something, I guess.  Is this your boyfriend? 
[00:17:30]  No, I came here by myself.  None of my asshole friends.  None of my asshole friends would come with me and it's my birthday.  I was like, thanks, guys.  Thanks a lot.  That's...  Well, look, you have a room full of new friends now for the day.  I'm sure little Jimmy will accommodate you.  I just want to make your birthday special.  Oh, you're only 20.  I was going to say, do you drink?  You should have lied.  Shit.  Yeah.  Hopefully, with these friends, you'll...  For your birthday, you wanted a gangbang, because that's probably what you'll get.  Oh, yeah, that would be lovely.  Probably get with... 
[00:18:00]  That's right.  Fifty teen balls in your face.  Lucky girl.  Well, that's good.  Happy birthday to you.  Thank you.  Anyone else celebrating anything special in the audience today?  What time is it?  What's your story, pal?  I'm Joe from West Orange.  Oh.  I am New Jersey.  Of course.  I haven't seen you guys since last softball game.  Oh, yeah.  I drove up here for this.  You drove up for this?  Yes.  Wow.  Since you got kicked out of Newark.  Yeah, Newark. 
[00:18:30]  The Newark stadium there.  What was there, 6,000, 7,000 people at the last softball game?  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah.  And now we might be able to get two teams together.  Maybe.  Very good.  Well, thank you, sir.  All right.  Very nice.  Kenny puts the mic in his face, and now he clammed up.  We're going to go to the phones where he was from.  Let's go to the phones and...  Let's see if they work.  They had a bad echo yesterday.  Phones, Ken.  John in Jersey.  What's up, John?  Hey, what's up, Bo?  Hey.  You guys rock.  I've been listening to you since you were on 102.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  And I know why there's nobody in the crowd today.  They're all outside filling out paperwork for Mr. Poe.  Who's Mr. Poe, stupid?  Mr. Poe.  You had it until you put the AMA in the eye.  Master.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thanks, John.  All right.  Punching out.  You can't punch out after the plane is in a hole in the ground.  You've crashed and burned.  Yeah.  Do you like Club Soda Kinney, too?  Stupid.  Let's go to Ryan in Jersey.  Ryan, what's up?  Ryan, what's going on?  How's everything? 
[00:19:30]  Hi, man.  How are you?  Oh, hi, mister.  Enough of this palaver.  What went on with Jimmy last night?  Did you get to watch that couple or not?  Oh, very good.  Yeah, that was a storyline that was hanging there.  I'll tell you why I didn't.  They might have done it.  I have their number.  You should explain.  Okay.  There's a couple that was at the show yesterday.  Hot girl.  And her boyfriend was really cool with her flashing and all that stuff.  And she made out with the other girl for wheelchair Fred.  And they were going to want a Wi-Fi.  So I'm like, well, let me watch you have sex.  And I'll hand one over in my room. 
[00:20:00]  And she gave me her number.  I never called them because we wound up going out to lunch yesterday.  That's what a faggot I am.  Oh, welcome, sir.  You know what's funny?  I've got to interrupt you.  These people are walking in, and they're just amazed that no one's here.  They're looking around like, am I in the right place?  Is this it?  This can't possibly be.  Another five people just showed up.  There they go.  That's nice.  All right, go ahead.  Take a seat.  Go ahead.  Find yourself a seat.  Plenty of seats still available.  One of those yellow Opie and Anthony cups.  That's right. 
[00:20:30]  There are plenty of them.  Actually, five in each hand.  Let's do that.  Everybody.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  And we went out to lunch yesterday, so I didn't call the couple.  So I kind of fucked up.  You didn't call because you were having lunch with us?  Yeah, and then I went to bed after that.  That was it?  Yeah.  Wow, I thought maybe, you know, the girl was kind of hot.  She was really hot.  But I just, I was like, you know, they were like real fans.  It was his birthday next Saturday when I'm doing the Bergada.  They're like, can you get us tickets for the Bergada?  And I would have felt bad having real fans come to my room and then just jerking off in front of them. 
[00:21:00]  Because then there's that awkward time after you're wiping your load off.  You're like, well, so do you like yellow discipline, do you?  It's just creepy.  So I decided not to.  Keep them in the dark.  Well, no, yeah, give them a, let them come to the show next week and have a good time.  All right.  You know.  I want to actually go to that show.  Are you coming to the Bergada?  Good.  I was going to, but I'm tired of traveling.  Yeah, I've had it.  I've had it with you people.  No, I've had it with, we've been on the road for two weeks. 
[00:21:30]  It started in Washington, then vacation, and then this.  I haven't been home in eight years.  Let's go to Mark in Boston.  Mark, what's up?  Hey.  Why don't you come here, man?  We could use you today.  I've got to go to work.  All right.  No one's on the road, though.  45 minutes from New Hampshire, Boston.  Hey, who's the genius at XM that planned a 7 o'clock show the morning after the rest of the opener?  No, no one happened.  We were up here for opening day, obviously, and it was just crazy yesterday. 
[00:22:00]  And stupid us, we thought we might get tickets to the game, which would make for a late night.  And then, you know, driving all the way back to New York, it didn't make sense.  So we're like, hey, we'll stay an extra day and do our show from Boston.  Yeah.  Turns out after the game, we jump in some psycho's van, who was a fan.  Oh, yeah.  And he dropped us off on Newberry Street.  We ate, and then we all just crashed.  We don't have any really good stories after the show yesterday.  No.  But that was our logic going into it, that actually we would be taken care of for once, and we'd have tickets to the game. 
[00:22:30]  No, no, we did not have tickets to the game.  We really should have just went home yesterday.  Good thing, though.  I definitely wouldn't have wanted to sit in Fenway and watch that disaster for the Yankees.  You guys are breaking up.  Wait, sir.  It's not about you, douchebag.  It wasn't breaking up on the air.  Who cares if his phone's breaking up?  I can't hear you.  Let's go to New Mexico.  Bill, what's up?  Can we?  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Bill?  Hey, I was going to say, being here in Boston, maybe you'd have a better turnout if you would have advertised the show as the Mick and his Dago, punching out. 
[00:23:00]  The Mick and his Dago?  Yeah.  I don't think Obie's Irish, though.  You can pass for Irish, but.  Nah.  All right.  It's the Mick and the Dago show.  There you go.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're going to take a break.  Ooh, time for a break already.  I think we're going to do a radio show today.  Yeah.  We'll take a whack at it.  Sure, why not?  At least the lights are nice and hot and making us bake a sweat up here. 
[00:23:30]  Jesus.  Kenny, is there anyone else coming in, or?  Kenny's working the door.  Oh, here comes someone right now.  Oh, he's here already.  He'll work outside, right?  What?  Microphone will work outside?  I hope so.  You should be like a carnival barker.  All right.  Kenny has left the building.  This will work very well, because he won't be able to hear us now.  Hey, chicks.  There's a show going on inside.  Come on in.  Chicks.  Ladies.  Ladies, Opie and Anthony.  Please?  Anybody?  That's it. 
[00:24:00]  Desperation.  Nobody out here either.  There's nobody out on the sidewalk.  Please.  That's what you want to hear.  The guy pleading.  Please?  Oh, that's too good.  Horrible.  Andrew in New York wants to say something.  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  Come home to New York.  Get the hell out of Boston.  We'll be back in New York tomorrow morning, yeah.  Working on it.  And we'll be checking out our new studio and everything.  All right.  All set and ready to go. 
[00:24:30]  It's supposed to be all fixed.  Yeah, we're going to be taking the show to the next level starting tomorrow.  These last two days are just, I don't know.  Yeah, for the people that are just tuning in, now that we're not on the premium anymore, Opie,  there are a lot of new people tuning in.  Just, you know, going past their music channels, perhaps they fall on this.  And I would like to apologize to every single one of them and say, tune in Wednesday.  Start listening to our show Wednesday.  I think today's going to be a good show.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  You guys want to see a good show, right?  What show are you going to listen to?  But then again, we'll stink tomorrow and we'll say, you know what?  We're just tired from the trip.  Tune in Thursday.  We are just a bunch of Ed excuses.  This is awful.  But somehow it's worked for 10 years.  How did that happen?  We haven't done a real radio show in 10 years.  Look, we know we blow.  Tune in January 2006 when the Hyundai deal kicks in.  No, it's going to be a great show.  Ben just handed me the guest list for today. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, what do we got?  Well, we're going to be talking to Kurt Long.  Fucking Kurt.  Dude.  Wait, do you know who Kurt Long is?  No?  Anyone know who Kurt Long is?  Kurt Long.  He's that guy.  He's, um, Shelly's ex.  No?  Well, Kurt Long is the host of Games Across America.  Okay, okay.  Enough joking.  Who's Kurt Long?  Airing Saturday nights from 9 to midnight on GSN.  Dude, they got him? 
[00:26:00]  What is GSN?  Stop it.  You're lying.  That doesn't say that.  Midnight, GSN.  The Network for Games.  Network for, it's the Game Show Network.  It's the one that plays, it plays like old Family Feud episodes.  And that other one, what's that?  Wow, wow.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Match game?  Thank you.  Kurt Long unveils the most unique competitions this country has to offer.  Oh, my God.  From the Rock, Paper, Scissors World Championships to Turtle Races. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, my God.  To Supermodel Volleyball and more.  Games Across America is in, what is that?  It's a program that wraps around the three-hour Saturday night block.  What is that?  I don't know.  So we got Kurt Long.  That's good news.  You know, if it ended there, it would be a full plate for anybody looking for entertainment as far as guests go.  But it doesn't end there, folks.  There's more in?  There's two more guests that are going to call in.  Now, normally a call-in is like, it's a call-in. 
[00:27:00]  But with guests of this caliber, even a call-in is surpassing my greatest expectation.  Rich Voss and Bob Kelly.  Wow.  Star-studded.  Star-studded.  Kurt Long.  Yep.  Bob Kelly and Rich Voss in the same four-hour period?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  That's why people didn't come.  They thought they'd never be able to get in.  I know.  This is just like watching Jay Leno.  It's unbelievable.  What?  We're on the same level as Jay Leno. 
[00:27:30]  You know, Kurt Long could be here right now and none of us could know it.  These people are going to watch us eat it today.  Nine to midnight on the Game Show Network?  And wrap-arounds are when there's like a three-hour block of show.  There's like a three-hour movie or something.  The wrap-arounds are those little cuts that they intersplice.  Yeah.  Like the little, like, you know, Up All Night with Ronda Sheer, that type shit where they pipe in for a minute.  Oh, is that what he's doing?  So it's not a show that lasts three hours.  I thought it was like Wonderama. 
[00:28:00]  No.  It would just last forever.  This guy is doing pretty much commercial breaks.  Yes.  Jesus.  It might be...  I can't stay here.  Why?  I'm sorry.  I have to leave.  Dude.  My car...  You don't even understand how close my car is.  That's right there.  I could leave.  The only thing that has prevented me from leaving certain shows is it's too far to my vehicle.  But, my God, it's right fucking outside.  And I got my keys in my pocket.  I guarantee this is going to be a very special show today. 
[00:28:30]  I guarantee.  This will be a show people will talk about for a very long time.  Kurt Long.  It makes me yearn for Spalding.  Wow.  Where's Ben?  Hiding.  Where is...  Ben is hiding.  Ben is hiding.  Well, Ben is the one that's responsible for the guest.  Is he up top?  Oh, people are just pointing.  Well, I think... 
[00:29:00]  Well, there's a balcony here at the Paradise.  And I think the next time we see Ben, he's going to be hanging from one of those hotels.  Look for the noose.  And then Ben's little shoes swinging in the breeze.  Like the omen, when she just throws herself off and hangs herself for Damien.  Right.  That reference never gets a laugh, and I keep fucking doing it.  I love it, though.  Someone out there is laughing.  I remember the last time that bombed.  You guys...  That's Kenny.  Please don't put yourselves down.  This is like O&A Unplugged.  Oh, that's a good way to look at it.  Intimate audience.  Sure.  And may I bring to everybody's attention, whose faces are on the post? 
[00:29:30]  Look at that.  That's big.  Thank you.  We're doing big in New York.  Thank you, Kenny.  And we are unplugged, but not in a good way, like the Terry Schiavo.  Just sitting here, wasting away, fucking slowly starving to death, waiting for Kurt Long  to come and shove a tube in our fucking mouth.  Yeah, where is the...  That's coincidental, too, because the audience is making the mouth like Terry.  Where's the food, by the way? 
[00:30:00]  Can I say about Terry Schiavo, one thing?  If I was her husband, I would have fixed those parents good.  I would have said, fine, we'll leave the plug in.  I just would have showed up at the hospital every day and fucked her.  Until they yanked it themselves.  I would have turned that stupid smile over, put her face in the pillow, and just railed  her until her father said, we get it, and yanked that feeding tube out.  That stupid, perpetual Colgate commercial face she has. 
[00:30:30]  I wanted to knock those awful teeth out.  Her teeth were dirty.  You haven't chewed food since 1990.  How are your teeth not clean?  God, did I have enough of that bitch?  Oh, I'd kill to have her in the room today.  One more person.  One more warm body.  Sort of.  You know the orderly had to put a couple of fingers in at once.  Jesus, all right.  What?  Groans.  I apologize.  All right.  It was one step too far.  All right.  Who's drinking today?  Anybody?  Woo!  We got three guys. 
[00:31:00]  Who's actually drinking alcohol right now?  All right.  These three, four, five people.  What are they?  Bloody Marys?  Beer.  This early in the month.  That's never an early year.  You know what?  We should get a game of quarters going or some beer pong.  We might as well like, you know.  Why don't you guys like, why not?  Come up with a drinking game.  Whenever another person walks in, you have to drink.  Sir?  Here's the menu.  He wants to get drunk.  Breakfast sandwich?  Is that the menu?  Wait.  These guys could eat? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Breakfast sandwiches for a dollar today?  Yeah.  Special.  O&A special.  Wow.  You can get breakfast sandwiches for a dollar today.  Oh, that means...  You know what?  Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm buying for the whole fucking room.  There you go.  Breakfast sandwiches for everybody.  Load them up.  I'm not kidding, Kenny.  There you go.  That would have been real nice if there were more than 20 people here, Anthony.  Jesus.  I'm trying to make a statement.  He just made it sound like he threw $1,000 down. 
[00:32:00]  Ixnay.  Mad bag of shells?  He gave $100.  He gave $79 back.  That's all right.  I know.  That's okay, Opie.  I heard you make the same offer in a phone booth.  All right.  Well, we're going to take a break and continue with the Opie and Anthony program in front  of about two dozen of our friends.  There you go.  That's right.  Kenny, make sure no one leaves.  No one out.  And during the break, if you guys want to, like, use your cell phones to call your friends  to come down, that would be really nice. 
[00:32:30]  That would be very helpful.  Oh, how about that?  Hey, Megan?  Well, look.  Somebody's actually calling.  Are you going to call a friend?  All right, get the mic over by him.  Call your friend.  I want to see how this will work.  Please call somebody.  It's going to go over well, but I'll do it.  All right.  Give it a try.  It's ringing.  What's your name, bro?  Ian.  Ian.  All right.  He's calling his friend to come on down and help us out here today.  No, I don't.  Is he awake?  Hopefully.  Yeah, hopefully.  It's kind of early.  Come on, Brian. 
[00:33:00]  Answer.  He doesn't work?  Oh, I call off work.  Oh, you were supposed to be in work.  Yes, I was.  What do you do?  I work at Gillette in Needham.  Gillette?  The razor company?  Batteries.  Oh.  Gillette makes batteries, too, huh?  Yeah, they do.  I was hoping to have three razor blades.  That's right.  You can bring up here to the household.  Anybody else work for a warm bathtub company?  Anyone else have a gym?  Did it answer?  Well, that went well.  All right, well.  The one guy that calls, and he doesn't get an answer. 
[00:33:30]  All right, we'll be back at the Paradise in just a few minutes.  Um.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  You tell us.  Hey, man.  What's going on, sweet cheeks?  Welcome to program, Dick.  Thanks, honey.  Hey, I was just calling because, um, speaking of tribute bands, I don't know if you guys  knew or not, but I think it was 2000, New Year's or Christmas, Great White actually did  a tribute to Led Zeppelin called Great Zeppelin, and if you ever get a chance, I've got some 
[00:34:00]  stuff, I can send it to you if you want, but if you can find it, he is, I mean, if  you didn't know, you'd think it was Led Zeppelin.  He's got that voice.  Well, uh, we're going to go and talk to Led and see if we can get a taste of Great White  doing Zeppelin.  Great White also did a tribute to Jimi Hendrix, uh, yes.  Not to mention a fine one to the Towering Inferno.  Oh, that's awesome.  All right, here's, uh, Great White doing a little Zeppelin, a little taste. 
[00:34:30]  Better than Robert Plant ever could sing this song, by the way.  You've heard of this version?  Plant's live voice closed.  Yeah, this guy does a great job.  Hey.  Hey.  Baby, baby, I'm going to leave you.  It's every note.  I said, baby, you know I'm going to leave you. 
[00:35:00]  My door is locked.  My door is locked.  I'm going to leave you when the summer's down.  Leave me when the summer comes rolling.  Leave me when the summer comes on. 
[00:35:30]  I'll be an Anthony.  Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.  Baby, I don't want to leave you.  O.B. and Anthony, the virus is spreading 
[00:36:00]  I am your muffin  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show  Oh my, how ruthlessly absurd  The O.B. and Anthony Show  I am the Lord  Ever-ending  That I believe is fading  I am the Lord 
[00:36:30]  In my...  Hey, it's me  God, you're so fucking hot  I don't want to fucking go crazy with this  I want to fucking eat you and fuck you and  Suck your tits  If you agree with this, say yes  But yes, being the best, say yes  Go back to your answer, Her  God, I want to fucking lick your pussy  And make you drunk so much 
[00:37:00]  I want to fucking go crazy with you  Go out and pass me to Olivia, please, man  Bye  That is so wrong  Well, that's for Jim Norton there  That's horrible  You figure that out at home, yeah  Well, we're live at the Paradise in Boston  In front of about, wow, it could be up to 30 people now  Yeah 
[00:37:30]  Another guy just walked in, 31  And you just paid for breakfast for everyone, right?  Yeah, what the hell, you know?  I figured it was a good opportunity to look like I'm a big spender  You know, for people's...  Hi, you've got to thank you out there  It's a dollar breakfast  Right  For everybody  So, what the hell?  What's, you know, 30 bucks?  When are you a bag of shells?  When are they going to start cooking the sandwiches?  I don't know  I don't smell anything  Are they cooking back there, Kenny?  Kenny, why don't you bring the mic? 
[00:38:00]  What kind of sandwiches are they, by the way?  Little egg sandwiches  Little cheese on them  No?  I just suspect they're going to look over like  Leftover dinner sandwiches from last night  Fucking burgers  You're the chef, sir?  Yep  What's your name, chef?  Jason  Jason, did you wash your hands?  Yep  Good, good  Are you making breakfast sandwiches for everybody?  Yep, for everybody  Ooh, and you got little muffins?  Definitely  Nice  You put any special treats in them?  No special treats today 
[00:38:30]  Alright, thank you for your hard work  Just hurry up  Exclusive interview from the kitchen  Yeah  That's great  Club soda, Kenny  Busboy doubles as the chef  That's good  Fuck with him while he's making our food  Good job  That guy was in the Serpent in the Rainbow  He's sprinkling powder into it  This is just the worst  Okay, well, everybody will get their egg sandwich  This is our life, though  It was funny, after the show yesterday 
[00:39:00]  This didn't make the air  I don't even know if anyone got a picture of it  Because it happened so fast  Yeah  But after the Bill's Bar gig  We're hanging out, signing autographs, taking pictures, whatever  And then they had the rink ceremony on the big screen  Yeah  Does anyone have a picture of that?  Oh, no one has a picture, though?  See, this guy knows  Here  Uh-huh  So what happened?  Did you see it?  I saw a little bit of it  I also read the post  It's like  Someone reported saying  Supple blemish-free took us  And then Opie's face 
[00:39:30]  Just laughing  Next to the screen  With Anthony throwing at Ortiz  Yeah, we were  That was like our  Kind of our backstage area  So behind the big screen  They're doing the rink ceremony  Everyone is facing the big screen  Looking at the rink ceremony  Because it was mostly Red Sox fans yesterday  And all of a sudden  I'm back there with Jimmy  I'm like, Jimmy, you've got to moon the crowd, right?  So all of a sudden  He just drops it  Drops trow  And starts mooning the crowd  And then I had my face down  Laughing my ass off  They're all looking  Yeah, watching the very important ceremony 
[00:40:00]  Yeah  To people in Boston  And all of a sudden  You just see Jimmy's white ass  Laughing  Below the screen  It was perfect height  I could have turned around  And really given everyone a thrill  Laughing  It really was  I have good cheeks  And then they were getting upset  Because I was throwing  I was crumbling up our  Our press shots  And throwing them at the big screen  Because I was a little  You know, aggravated  Yeah, didn't those gay bouncers  Just tell you to knock it off there?  Yeah, they were like  Knock it off  I'm like, ah  Just kept throwing them

Say, week one, open your legs  Week two, push  Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what you could possibly 
[00:42:30]  Isn't it just they go in the hospital  And there's trained people that know how to deliver a baby  And they deliver it?  Yeah, but those trained people, that's what we do  But aren't they doctors?  No  That went to medical school?  No  You're just pulling women off the street and going, here's what you do?  Well, hopefully they have their RNs  So they're nurses  Oh, so they're nurses, hopefully  But you don't even know?  Well, we try  We try and screen them  Jeez, this sounds very willy-nilly  Like you could just come in there and go, yeah, I'll give it a shot 
[00:43:00]  Grab the little guy by the nostrils and drag him out  Hopefully they come head first, yeah  Are you a nurse?  No, I'm not  Wait, you're not a nurse?  No  But you're training nurses on how to deliver babies?  Yeah  How'd you get that gig?  I had my master's in public health  Public health  I thought you had a lot of kids and you just know what it's all about  Yeah, you know how to do it  No, I don't have kids yet  All right  You're lovely  So you don't even have kids?  No  You are not qualified to do what you do  I'm qualified to coordinate what I do  Wow  So I don't actually have to train 
[00:43:30]  I just have to make sure everyone has all their shit in a row  You're a middleman  Yeah, I'm a middleman  You're the middleman that any consultant would decide you aren't needed  That's right  I could be out on the street in two days  Yeah  All right  Well, congrats  It's good that you've been able to parlay that into a fake chat  Welcome to Boston  It's good to have you back  I've been listening for years and years and years  Cool  Welcome to the program, Megan  Thank you  Find yourself a seat  Shouldn't be too difficult  Should we just  Maybe we should just interview our audience today 
[00:44:00]  Megan, you dropped something  These people could be more interesting than the guests we have planned for the show, Anthony  Did she really drop something?  Yeah, she dropped all sorts of stuff  I thought you pulled a gag on her  No, I like Megan  I wouldn't do that to her  Megan, are you single?  No, but my boyfriend's listening  Hi, Joe  Yeah  Would he have sex with you in front of a child?  A chubby little comic?  I don't know, but we were thinking we could one-up that for Jim 
[00:44:30]  You could?  Do what?  Like he rapes me while you applaud?  Like you can?  I don't know, maybe I could try  Maybe just helping oral treats for both of you at the same time  Yeah, I'll agree  That would certainly one-up  I don't want our helmets bumping, though  That would be a mood kill  That would be kind of gross  Is he packing a lot?  Yeah  Yeah, I couldn't handle that  I don't even  He's Italian  He's Italian?  Oh, well  All right, so he's dumb  All right, so do it both  But I have one more thing 
[00:45:00]  Uh-oh  Now she's taking her coat off  It's either a tits or she has a pistol  This is for Anthony  This is for Anthony  Because we're in Boston  And we're very outnumbered  Ah, very good  She's a Yankee fan  Look at that  Soriano, nice one  Texas  Go ahead  Go ahead  Go ahead  Boo her  She wants to give oral treats to Jimmy  New York is  How are you booing her?  Way to be  Yeah  That's great  So what would you do?  Like double pumper action?  Something like that?  Something like that?  The old salt and pepper shaker 
[00:45:30]  That's what we like to call it  You know?  Could try  Yeah  I'd like that  Yeah  The old tank controls  Double fisting  Double fisting  Double fisting  And then you'd like move your head around?  Or, yeah  Like a circus seal  Swivel chairs  By the way, for the audience at home  Megan is very, very cute  I'll say she is  Beautiful blonde there  So  Thank you  He's serious though  You know that, right?

[00:46:00]  I just  You fell asleep  I didn't know if they would really do it  Well, you didn't even call to find out  Good point, Megan  Yes  You know what you could do?  You could do that with Jimmy and your boyfriend  And turn the lights out and play Russian roulette  Which one has the AIDS?  You know?  It'd be interesting  Until I get a bubble shot  Yes  That's it  One of those penises  Watch it  More of a fatal head shot than the one that Kennedy got

[00:48:30]  If he had a voicemail, she would have left about 13 messages  Wow  Well, dude, I got the number, so I'll call  I'll call  Like I said, I just  Here's another thing  These guys were drinking  I didn't want them to do anything they were going to feel shitty about  Because his birthday is next week  He's coming to the show  I would have felt like  If I feel shitty, he means have him arrested for  Yeah, that kind of could translate into that  I don't know, but I'll definitely call  If you guys still want to  I'd absolutely like to watch this 
[00:49:00]  I don't think I have a choice in the matter  By the end of the night, she's like  Maybe he's just waiting for Atlantic City to bang me  Oh, wow  Well, look, if you guys are still interested down there  And you want to do that  I'll definitely watch  If you guys are still cool with that  You have time to think it over  If you're still comfortable, I'll definitely do it  Yeah, Sean, you have no problem with this, huh?

I just did  How does it taste?  Oh, it's terrific  Wouldn't that be good?  As you take a bite, Poe could serve it to you

[01:00:30]  Not Kurt Long  From the Game Show Network, right?  Sure  Is Ben around?  Can we ask Ben?  Where's Sweetie?  Ben has been hiding  He's the producer of the show  Everyone turn their heads to the balcony over there  Normally the producer stands side of the stage  To make sure everything's running like clockwork  Ben  Ben  Angel  Ben  Ben  Oh, Ben  Ben  He's got to just show his head, no?  He can't not show it  Mr. Met 
[01:01:00]  Ben  Ben's finally in Boston  He won't show his face  Oh my God  Yeah, Ben's finally in Boston  And he won't show his face  Can we call the United States  Geological Survey  And see where there's an earthquake happening  And perhaps at its epicenter  Is the herking and jerking Ben?  Hey, DJ  You're the DJ, right?  What's Ben doing?  He's talking to the manager or something?  About...  Yeah, please get him  Why not? 
[01:01:30]  Can we have Ben  Keep track of the parking meters?  Is he talking into something that resembles a dime?  Because that's his phone  Wait, Zig  All right, while we...  I can't believe Ben has just completely  Disassociated himself with the program  Well, look around  He is not  Wouldn't you?  No, I think this is going to be a fun show  Most producers, though, stay right on the side of the stage  And that way you say, hey, we need this  And they run  Are we piling these up for our contest? 
[01:02:00]  Oh, yeah, these are contest eggs  All right  I hope so  Anyone not eating their eggs  Add them to the pile  Yes, step right up  Step right up  And add them to the pile  Bring them up  And pile them up  Make sure they don't fall on the floor  I'd hate to have people have to eat it off the floor  We'll have four contestants, I guess  Ah, there we go  Whoever isn't eating  Feel free  Bring them up  All right  All right, get a good one  Hey, Wick  All right, why don't we take a break, Anthony

[01:03:00]  I had still some staining from smoking  Yellow staining, what is that?  Yeah, from urine  I don't understand what this one is  I forget it, just, you know, wipe it off  You like chocolate cake a lot, don't you?  Oh, my God  Your teeth are so clean  Do you rinse with ammonia of some sort?  Because that really cleans your teeth  But she told me I had great bone  They do this weird test on your teeth  Where they  It's really uncomfortable to get the x-rays  They take like 30 x-rays of your mouth  Yeah  And then they have a  She puts this little thing 
[01:03:30]  And it goes  Three, one, two, one  Over each tooth  They actually put a thing between your tooth and gums  Real quick  And they measure the distance  Wow  To make sure that your teeth and gums  Are like between each part of your teeth and the gums  Yeah  Why are you explaining something that  Everyone goes through?  You mean you've actually done that?  Oh, my  Everyone in their cars right now  Like you're explaining a teeth examination  You're explaining a visit to the dentist  Yeah, you idiot  I've gotten to me  How long has it been?  A couple years  You were explaining that  Like it's  You're the only person that's ever been through it 
[01:04:00]  They take pictures?  They take  Wow  They take 30 x-rays?  No  He actually said it takes 30 x-rays  And they're very uncomfortable  Wow  And they take this instrument and go  One, two, two, three, two, three, three, three, one, two, three, three, three, one, two, three, three, three, I never had that before  And then they take this thing, it's like a fishing line  And they actually go in between your teeth  All right  Stop it  No  There's a small little toilet bowl next to me that  The water goes down it in a swirl and you spit into it 
[01:04:30]  And they give you fluid but they don't want you to drink it  You rinse and they want you to wake this lovely beverage  No, I understand  Guys, it's really weird that they start by putting a bib on you  Oh, stop it  I'm like ready to eat but it's really heavy and filled with sand and lead  This isn't for food  Why are you running out of the room?  I really don't take a good picture  Ha, LOL  Opie and Anthony  The virus is spreading  Live from Boston, Massachusetts  It's the Opie and Anthony Show

[01:06:30]  It's really not an awful crowd  They're doing the best they can, you know  Of course they are  There's just not a lot of people here if you're just tuning in  That's funny, too  Which one?  Whackbag.com, Kirk said, you guys should just loop the car crash until 11 o'clock  Bastard  We might try something different today  We might do the second half of our show from the road  Can I ask how it went from the last 20 minutes to the second half of our show?  Second half went from 20 minutes to two hours  Yeah, we can see how far we'll get 
[01:07:00]  It'll be interesting to the listeners  As soon as my meter runs out, I'm out of here  What is it, an hour meter?  We're not even on an hour yet?  Start sweating, fat boy  I thought it was like 10.40, 11 o'clock  It had to be close, right?

No, I go to Boston  All right, thank God  Okay  And Mike from Shoes, your match  Uh-oh  Cool  It looks like Mike should be the favorite  But in arm wrestling, a lot of things can happen  Especially since they're not over the table on one side  Can I ask a question?  You're a Red Sox fan?  Oh, of course  And you're a Yankees fan?  Yeah  Oh, this is kind of interesting, huh? 
[01:10:30]  Kenny, what happens when they go the other way  And there's no table for him to put his hand down on?  Yeah, that guy's going to break his arm  Yeah, Kenny  They've got to move  Good  They've got to move into the middle of the table, I think  All right  Well, that's going to be  So we've got to  No?

Oh, damn  All right, well  Well, we have our four contestants  Yes, we do  And then we have a huge table now  That is just being filled up with these breakfast sandwiches  How do you not put your money on this lummox?  Lummox  Well, one thing we didn't bring up, though 
[01:12:30]  Is also every egg sandwich is accompanied  By two tiny little midget muffins  Those are like little dwarf thumbs  Those muffins  Disgusting little dwarf thumbs  Oh, God  It's like those  It's like a little penis  Hey, I was wondering if Jimmy could touch all of them  Because I was in the bathroom before  And he didn't wash his hands  Oh, no, Jimmy washed his hands 
[01:13:00]  No, I didn't  Oh, you always wash your hands  I normally do, but I didn't  Jimmy  My dick is fine  It's clean  Oh  Jesus  I thought you had good hygiene  I do  My dick is not dirty  I don't  Why is Jimmy taking pictures of the egg sandwiches?  For Foundry music?

[01:13:30]  Don't give out the link yet, Ant  We'll crash Foundry  All right, wait  So how is this going to work?  Well, I think we've got to organize the egg sandwiches better  Into piles  Yes, each individual should have their own pile  And Kenny, why don't we get to know the contestants?  Okay, let's talk to the big geek first  All right  What's your name, bro?  Ben  Ben, and where are you from?

Good point, Ken  Yeah  Yeah  Aren't there more on the floor or something?  And some of those are half-eaten, by the way  Yeah, there's a couple in there  There's a couple half-eaten, so it's not equal  Look at that pile  It's half-eaten  That one doesn't even have an egg sandwich  I know, that one's just got the two little midget thumbs  And a thing of ketchup  A little piece of pork  Look

[01:21:00]  Yeah, throw that in your room  I think we have one for everybody  Ooh  One of the big posters  All right  So  Did he ever get confused when you were babysitting and think you were having an affair with somebody  And come over and yell, come on out, Hob  Come on, Harvey  Oof  No, not yet  I love that episode  I still deserve more than it  Not yet  That's all right  I know people at home are chuckling  Honeymooners  Well  All right 
[01:21:30]  Honeymooners, car crash myself  I never knew Davey Crockett had nine toes  All right, well I guess we're ready for the contest  Actually, we're not  We need one more contestant  One can't participate  Why?  It doesn't have any ID  So we're not allowed to let him do it  What's a big point?  I know  It means big  I see that, yeah  Another great racist email 
[01:22:00]  All right, we need another contestant  Who's out of the contest?  What happened?  Just because your shirt sleeves don't fit exactly right?  You fucking Frankenstein  What happened?  I don't carry my driver's license  What happened?  Why don't you carry ID with you?  I have my student ID  That's all we ever need  This is America, for God's sake  What do I...  Wait, did you have ID  But you dropped it when the villagers were chasing you with torches?  Yeah, all I need is my student ID 
[01:22:30]  And he said it's not good enough  Student ID  Because you don't drive, is that it?  No, not here  Who the fuck would drive here?  Yeah, you're right  All right, we're going to lose Ben from Cleveland, you guys  Bye-bye, Ben  All right, bye-bye  Well, that's a shame  Okay, we're going to need somebody else  How about the guy that lost the arm wrestling contest?

I think they should face the audience  And we can kind of peek over their shoulder  I think the audience is more important  Yes  Oh, okay  Probably that's all I am  They came here for something  We might as well give them a little show  You know what, Ant?  That's what I was trying to say  Oh, wait, Eric, you got it  Okay, why don't we take a break 
[01:23:30]  And when we come back, we'll do our egg sandwich eating contest  Oh, Jesus Christ  And thank you all for tuning in to Z100 this morning  Live from the paradise  It's Opie and Anthony  Yeah  We'll continue  Thank you  Take it  That's the real deal 
[01:24:00]  Yeah  That's what we do  That's the real deal  That's the shit  That's the real deal  Yeah  That's what we do  That's the real deal  That's the shit.  Dance, motherfucker, dance. 
[01:24:30]  Dance, motherfucker, dance.  Dance, motherfucker, dance.  Dance, motherfucker.  Dance, motherfucker, dance. 
[01:25:00]  Dance, motherfucker, dance. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:26:00]  I like it.  It's a virus in me.  I like it.  Walk me in the morning.  I like it.  It's a virus in me.  Take it.  Keeps a virus in me.  I like it.  It's a virus in me.  I like it.  That's the real deal. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, that's what we do.  That's the real deal.  That's the shit.  That's the real deal.  Yeah, that's what we do.  That's the real deal.  That's the shit.  That's the real deal.  You're the violence to me.  Yeah, that's what we do.  You're the violence to me.  That's the shit. 
[01:27:00]  You're the violence to me.  I like you.  I like you.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's showtime, folks.  Turn it on and watch a show. 
[01:27:30]  You're going to be made fun of.  All right.  Man, those guys are really cards.  Why don't you shove it out your ass?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I am the Muffin.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my.  How lucidly absurd.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:28:00]  Come on, get down with the sick.  Come on, get down with the sick.  Come on, get down with the sick.  All right.  We're back at the Paradise Live in Boston, Massachusetts.  The Opie and Anthony program.  Day two.  A lot different than day one.  Oh, yeah.  This is our life, though.  I guess we're ready for the egg sandwich eating contest.  Oh, my God.  This is for a MiFi.  Oh, wow.  Yes, it is. 
[01:28:30]  The big MiFi giveaway.  What are we going to do?  We're going to have a timed event?  What are the rules, Opie?  Thanks, sweetie.  Well, that's a good question.  Do we have anybody out there that can figure this out?  I want water for everybody.  Thank you.  Well, we need a timed event, and I believe whoever can eat the most in that amount of time will be our winner.  Okay.  And how about this?  They can only eat eggs while I'm getting blown.  Oh.  Do you want to eat? 
[01:29:00]  I know how much time we should do.  Two and a half hours?  Yeah.  Too slow.  Safety first.  Now, the eating strategies here.  Do you go with the eggs and save all the disgusting little midget toe muffins for last?  I don't know.  What do you do?  What do you clear a plate at a time?  Those muffins look like the skin tags on a fat person's neck. 
[01:29:30]  You ever see fat people, they get those little skin tags on their neck.  You just want to bite them and pull them off until they scream and get on a treadmill?  All right.  Well.  Disgusting.  Why don't we get our contestants to sit down?  Scott, Mike, Mike, and Vanessa.  All right.  Wait, Vanessa.  Know what we can do, Anthony, because this is going to get really messy and confusing.  Yeah.  I think we need, like, Eric and Club Soda Candy and maybe Wiki and somebody else to all look at one of the contestants to figure out, you know, how much they ate. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, I think that, oh, Jesus, dude.  I just saw, like, so much of your ass crack.  It's all right.  It's nice.  Dude, look, Opie, you've got to see.  Stand up and sit down again.  Don't be shy.  Don't touch anything.  Just stand up.  That's right.  Now, slowly sit again like you did.  No.  No, just look.  The guy next to him is pulling his pants down.  Lift up your sweatshirt a little bit.  It's not gay.  Who cares? 
[01:30:30]  There you go.  Oh, my God.  There is, like, a good five inches of ass crack when you were sitting down, my friend.  And that's width.  By the way, we should say hi to Wheelchair Fred before the contest starts.  Ah, Fred made it.  Fred's now in the bathroom?  He's in the bathroom.  Good.  He'll be out by the way.  And where's Frank from Jersey?  Frank from Jersey was the one that took Wheelchair Fred under his wing here.  He might be in the bathroom, too.  What is he, wiping Wheelchair Fred?  Where's Frank?  Helping him out? 
[01:31:00]  They're like a new comedy team, these two.  Ah, fantastic.  And Frank looks like every guy ever arrested for hitting a Jew for no reason.  Blonde-haired psychopath.  Yeah, he's got pictures from yesterday already.  Yeah, printed on some fucking awful printer.  Where's that awful picture that he had of us that he wanted us to sign?  He was so proud of it, too.  Looks like a Department of Motor Vehicles 10 years ago printer printing these things. 
[01:31:30]  And he wants us to sign them, I guess.  He brings in a red marker.  Hey, Kenny, why don't you, you know, go into the bathroom.  Oh, here's Wheelchair Fred.  Ah, Fred.  Let's hear it for Wheelchair Fred.  He finally made it.  He started yesterday afternoon.  It was only two miles down the road, and he's now here.  Fred, I want to ask you, how much money was collected for you yesterday?  $107.  $107?  $107.  What a coincidence. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  He used to, uh...  At 30 cents.  What?  $107.30.  Oh, and 30 cents.  Right, I get it.  $107.3.  That was our old station up here.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm funny, too.  Don't you know?  Yeah, you're funny, all right.  Now, how'd you get here?  I know you were asking everybody if you would get a ride to come here. 
[01:32:30]  How did you get here?  You're a nice guy, Frank.  Put me up last night.  Oh, you slept over a man's house?  Yeah, but we didn't do nothing.  We just slept, believe me.  You just what?  He's married anyway.  Oh, he's married?  We just slept in separate beds in the same room.  Wait, wait.  Separate beds, but the same room?  Was his wife there?  No.  Where's his wife?  Oh, my guess. 
[01:33:00]  So you had other desires, but you think that he's just using you for the parking.  No.  Wait a minute, Fred.  Wait, wait.  Where did you stay?  Where did you stay?  In a motel.  Oh, so you stayed in a motel with a man.  Yeah, but he doesn't think, believe me.  So, but were there twin beds?  Yeah.  So you slept in separate beds?  Yeah, of course.  Did you J-O? 
[01:33:30]  No, I didn't go.  I just didn't.  You didn't go visit the bathtub with your dildo, did you?  No, I didn't.  I didn't think so.  You should have brought the dildo here.  Yeah.  Could have waved that under the noses while they were eating the food.  Just a very famous dildo, you know?  It is very famous.  I think people would have wanted a picture with it.  Where is Frank?  We've got to talk to Frank.  Is he in the bathroom still?  Yeah, he must be.  I don't know.  He said you were a pain in the ass and it took you forever to get ready for today. 
[01:34:00]  Has it taken forever?  We've got to find this place.  That's easy.  No, you wanted to take a shower and all that, right?  I did it later.  All right.  Well, when Frank gets back in the room, we'll talk to Frank.  Yeah, you must be taking a real wicked dump.  Yeah.  Well, he could stink up that men's room.  You know, it's like a real German Knuckworth shit.  All right.  I guess we're ready for this very exciting contest. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, stop.  Oh, God.  He brought the dildo.  He brought the dildo.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Fred, is that the one?  That's the one.  Oh, God.  Is that really the one?  Is that really the one?  All right, wait.  It's really the one.  20 bucks.  For anyone that will just put that in their mouth real quick.  Why? 
[01:35:00]  Fred.  You don't count.  He's like, Eric, why'd you say no?  It's only a piece of plastic.  Yeah.  It's sexual.  It's not a real...  What's the matter with you, Eric?  He's waving that thing around.  What's wrong with anybody sticking that in their mouth?  We don't know what he's done with it or if it's clean or not.  That's the beauty of it.  Oh, it's mine.  Hopefully it's filthy.  No.  A disease can't last that long outside of stuff.  I want to see a piece of grape skin hanging off it.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Everyone is taking pictures of the famous film. 
[01:35:30]  That is famous.  Fred, how far do you get that thing in?  Let me see.  Where?  Right to the rubber balls?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Everyone is hard.  I lose a goose.  You lose a goose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fred, do you normally carry that around with you?  No.  No.  I bring it just for you, honey.  Well, thank you. 
[01:36:00]  That's fantastic.  I notice you pulled it out of your fanny pack.  That's kind of a coincidence.  Yeah.  Now, the Red Sox have World Series rings on display today, and we got a dildo.  Yeah.  Yes, man.  Let's put the dildo on a table.  Well, nowhere near me.  And then people can walk up to it and then look at it and study it, get their picture  taken with it.  Maybe right there.  Why in my area?  I don't want to move it.  No, no.  I mean on the edge of that table.  Oh, why was I so lucky?  As close as I want that thing. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, Fred, why don't you place the dildo up there and people could come up and admire  it.  Take pictures with it.  Take pictures with it.  That's the famous dildo that Fred uses in the bathtub, and you heard it live on our show.  Fred using that one.  Well, they weren't allowed to hear it when we went off the premium, unfortunately.  No, no.  It's a legendary bit, but wheelchair Fred went into his bathtub and took care of himself  with that dildo.  Well, it's sort of a sordid story.  He's very desperate for a woman.  He hasn't been able to get laid in years, so he opened up his options to men. 
[01:37:00]  He's not gay.  He's just desperate.  He keeps saying that.  So he picked up a guy at a convenience store.  The guy came over his house and had sex with him, actually had sex to him.  Fred was the bottom.  And for some reason, even though he's not gay, he's just desperate, the act of having  something in there turned him on so much that he bought a dildo, and now he uses it on himself  to turn himself on.  We had him on the phone, and he actually used it live on our show. 
[01:37:30]  He gets into the bathtub, lubes it up, and drives it on home.  Someone had a great line at the show yesterday.  They were saying it's not gay if you don't have the muscle tone to push back.  You have to push back.  I'd rather enjoy it, I would admit.  You'd rather enjoy it, you would admit.  Yeah, it's nice.  You like having that thing where the sun don't shine, right up there, huh?  Did you know that you'd come on your ass?  What? 
[01:38:00]  You can come on your ass.  All right, look, look, look, look, look.  Hey, we're not going to translate that one.  Fred.  Yeah, okay.  Fred.  No, you can't.  No, you can't, Fred.  No, you can't.  Maybe.  You might want to get that checked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe there was some internal injuries you didn't know about.  Yeah.  Maybe.  I don't know.  That's your kidney leaking.  Fred, there is no way, no way that that is true. 
[01:38:30]  That can't happen.  You tore the lining, Fred.  Oh, probably.  Or perhaps something was leaking out after the guy finished.  That wasn't yours.  It was Bob's.  He really thinks he's a woman.  Yeah.  I'm a squirter.  Yeah.  Should we ask more questions about this, Anthony? 
[01:39:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, Fred.  Fred.  Why?  Why?  Yeah.  How do you think guys could do that?  How do you know this?  Experience.  So, now this has happened to you.  You've actually orgasmed backwards.  Yes.  So, you're using the dildo.  I'm a good person.  And you lube it up.  And now, in the course of using it, you've had some type of orgasm, which has made something 
[01:39:30]  that left your body.  Yes, he's nodding.  Hershey squirts.  What color was this?  I didn't tell you.  I don't look good.  You don't know what color it is?  All right.  Here's another hint.  What did it smell like?  Well, it didn't smell like shit.  It didn't smell like shit.  How about copper?  Did it smell like copper?  I don't know.  Hey, by the way, you guys working up an appetite for those egg sandwiches with this scrumptious 
[01:40:00]  grilling conversation?  Scrumptious.  Scrumptious.  I know who he looks like.  No one's going to remember.  Your face, you remind me of the gas station guy who was shooting at Steve Martin in The Jerk.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  That's his face.  He's mouth in my eyes.  Yeah.  The younger version.  It's very good.  Yeah.  Yeah, way to just thought of it.  All right.  Well, someone is suggesting that we put the dildo up on eBay.  No, he needs that.  Yeah, who's going to buy that? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, who's going to buy that?  One of our freaks will.  Fred, you should put that on eBay.  That's right.  And sell it.  You probably make a lot of money, and then you can buy a new one.  I'll just buy another one.  You just buy another.  You're probably working yourself up to a bigger one anyway, right?  You ever see the anal intruder?  It's like this.  I don't think that's my big-ass me.  It looks like a black power fist.  He's probably in love with this one.  He could be. 
[01:41:00]  Do you have any emotional attachment to this one?  No.  Does it have a name?  No.  You didn't name your dildo?  Jaime.  Jaime.  That's Jaime right there.  He's like, what the?  He's like, what the?  His dildo's name is Jaime.  Jaime.  Jaime.  All right.  Oh, that's great.  Hey, Kenny, we've got to talk to Frank.  Frank took Wheelchair Fred in last night.  Hi, I'm Frank from New Jersey.  My name is Frank, and I was only following orders. 
[01:41:30]  Man, you are a Nazi-looking mother.  I'm potential to the war effort.  You are really a Nazi-looking guy, man.  I've got to tell you.  Another hardcore fan of the show.  I'm a big fan of something from the old show.  It was called Cam Concentration.  I always request it, but you guys never put it on.  It was the funniest thing.  It doesn't surprise me at all.  It's all good.  That's good.  You look good in a pith helmet.  Look at him.  So why did you take Fred in?  He put on a good act yesterday.  I've got to keep it going. 
[01:42:00]  This guy is really something.  I'm taking him home for experimentation.  How many feet of dildo can you get him?  I've got to tell you a story this morning.  This was something else.  I got up at 5.  I wanted to be on time for the show.  So Fred, he didn't want to get up.  So after that, we got him up.  We got him out of bed.  Got him out of bed.  Clow through.  He goes into the bathroom.  About an hour later, he comes out. 
[01:42:30]  The whole bathroom was covered with shit.  This was awful.  Are you kidding?  I walked in there.  I walked in and said, Fred, what the fuck did you do?  So, that's a Mr. Feach.  No.  After about a half an hour, me cleaning up his crap.  You just got mad spit in your ear and you didn't even...  I took a shower and we got here, but...  Wait, wait, wait.  This was a motel bathroom?  Yeah.  Why did you clean it?  You cleaned up wheelchair Fred's shit?  No, well...  And where was it? 
[01:43:00]  Was it on the walls or the...  Bathtub.  Fred!  Oh, he probably used his...  Fred, did you use your dildo in the bathtub last night?  No.  Why was there crap all over the bathtub?  Accident.  You had an accident?  What happened?  You thought...  Nothing.  I...  What do you mean, what happened?  Look how big that thing is.  He had a wet dream.  He had no control anymore back there.  Hey, Fred, wait a minute, Fred.  I had a really wet dream. 
[01:43:30]  You were in the...  You were in the shower or the bathtub?  Were you taking a bath?  I took a shower.  You were taking a shower and you lost control of your bowels?  Yeah.  And you crapped all over the bathtub?  And why didn't you clean it up?  I did.  Apparently you didn't?  It's his imagination.  It was a little...  What?  That one you're going to have to do again.  I sat there for like a half hour. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, that's why he took forever.  So you sat there pondering, what are you going to do with this shit?  Yeah.  And then decided you were going to clean it up a little bit?  You got it.  So what did you use to clean it?  Mother Nature in the water.  You just kind of pushed it with your hands in the water, didn't you?  Did you use the washcloths in the hotel?  No, I wouldn't do that.  So what did you use? 
[01:44:30]  Free.  I had the shower nozzle.  Oh, the shower nozzle.  So you just kind of hosed it down?  Yeah, you got it.  And it went down the drain?  But now it wasn't all gone, I guess.  Apparently not.  Yeah, apparently you left a lot in the soap dish.  I just eat it.  I wasn't that hungry.  What a freak show.  I can't imagine you cleaned this up.  Yeah, Frank.  Go back to Frank. 
[01:45:00]  Go back to Frank.  Eric.  Eric.  Eric.  Frank's nodding off.  I'm a plumber.  I'm used to dealing with shit.  Oh, okay.  You're a plumber.  You ever do the hand plunge?  Yeah, yeah.  The hand plunge.  I saw a plumber do this in my house once.  Yeah, a plumber comes over.  The toilet was all clogged up and nothing would work.  He goes, it's going to need a hand plunge.  And I go, what the fuck?  And before I could even know, he puts both hands shit deep.  Because there's crap in the toilet.  It's all broken apart now.  It looks like Dinty Moore.  Like I dumped a can of Dinty Moore in the toilet. 
[01:45:30]  He goes both hands right in and starts giving my toilet CPR.  He's like pumping the hole in the toilet.  And then you hear it go, it gurgles and it goes down the drain.  And he's like, you know.  Did he wash his hands afterwards?  I was out of that bathroom so quick.  Yeah, Anthony doesn't like stuff like that.  I hoped he washed them.  But, uh, what?  What were you eating?  I know, I was eating Dinty Moore stew, my friend.  So you're a plumber, so you're used to shit. 
[01:46:00]  It doesn't really.  So you walked into the bathroom, and even though Fred tried to clean up, it was still a mess?  It was like whatever he did, he washed shit all over the floor, the walls.  So instead of cleaning it up, he took it from one concentrated area and spread it all over the bathroom.  When I went in that bathroom, it was shit everywhere.  All right, let's give a plug to that motel.  Where were you guys last night?  We were down at the Best Western down the street.  We couldn't find another place.  It was crazy.  That's great.  The Best Western.  Why would you bring Fred back to your motel? 
[01:46:30]  You can't be that nice.  Everyone else...  I'm a huge fan of the show.  Everyone else turned their back on Fred yesterday.  I met most of the people at the Hard Rock and everybody, and I'm a 100% fan, and I took one for the team, you know?  You certainly did.  You certainly did.  Fred, do you have a problem holding your bowels?  Occasionally, yeah.  Occasionally, but is it usually in the shower, or when you're sitting in the chair, can you, like, all of a sudden just crap, or...?  Whatever. 
[01:47:00]  Whatever.  Wherever you are.  Wherever.  Geez, maybe you ought to keep the dildo in there.  Yeah, I saw that.  I bet you did.  I bet he was using it, and then he just sneezed and blew it across the room.  No, no, it's too long.  All right, well, wheelchair Fred, everyone, he's in the house.  All right, Fred, always an interesting story.  You guys got change?  You can hand it over to Fred.  He's still collecting money for rent.  How embarrassing this is.  Yeah, it certainly is. 
[01:47:30]  Now, if this pretty come out, I push my ass.  Yeah, she was going to fuck you until that story, Fred.  Yeah, you really had a shot.  I must have believed it.  Wow.  You stick your pretty ponytail in my butt, honey.  What?  Say that again, Fred.  You stick your ponytail up my ass.  Fred, he's talking to one of the far young ladies here.  What?  You stick your ponytail up my ass.  Oh, her ponytail up your ass. 
[01:48:00]  Fred, she's hot.  That's great.  Smooth.  That's great.  Don't you realize that's your first line to her?  That's your icebreaker?  She gives it to the time of the day.  The problem is, actually, I used on me.  I'm basically a fan of the dude.  Wow.  You lost me at...  I did it.  I'm basically a very intelligent dude. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, well, we know that.  Basically a very intelligent dude.  But all these people, they judge me on my voice.  I understand.  How many times Stephen Hawking has been, you know, shitting in a Best Western bathroom?  You know, I can't even count.  We better talk to you.  You're right.  It is the voice, too.  It's not the stranger in the deli raping you on your own bed or the dildo in a toolbox.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:49:00]  Well, you'll be better safe than sorry.  Better safe than sorry.  Sure.  Anthony, we're going to take another break.  Of course we are.  And then when we come back, we will get into the egg sandwich eating contest for a MyFive.  Nice.  If you have change for wheelchair Fred, he's accepting all donations.  Dollar bills, anything.  Baby wipes.  Baby wipes would be nice at this point.  I've got my bucket in the car.  Oh, you left your money bucket in the car, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, maybe we could come up with something. 
[01:49:30]  Well, today we'll use the money cup.  You can put it right in here.  No, no.  No, Fred.  No, that's okay.  We're not going to put it there.  That's great.  We'll have a bathroom full of dollar bills.  Lose change.  All right.  We've got to go to the phones.  People have a lot of comments out of his mind.  Let's go to Carl in New Jersey.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  This happened to Fred because of a motorcycle accident, right?  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  Well, listen, I was trying to get a motorcycle for so many years, and now that I hear Fred,  I don't want one.  I want four wheels under me at all times.  And bellow around you.  Yeah, really.  And lots of airbags.  Yeah, really.  Hey, guys, listen, you've got a great show.  We're having a lot of fun listening, and I'm out.  All right.  Thank you.  Fred, were you a big biker guy?  Were you like you were a biker, right?  Like, what?  Oh, we need his mic on.  What's the biker?  I was in Wimpa.  What?  I was in Wimpa. 
[01:50:30]  I just bought the bike to save money.  You just bought the bike to save money?  It was a little 250.  Oh, so it wasn't a big Harley or something?  No, it was an Enduro.  An Enduro?  It was a rice burner.  You got it.  Oh, how long did you have it before you were wrecked?  Four months.  Oh, to save money, right?  Yeah, for you, yeah.  Jesus Christ, if you only knew.  Because I had to charge that whole kind of a car for you. 
[01:51:00]  When they work for hundreds, they need to love this.  Some good gas.  Whoa.  Jesus.  You made an elephant man sound.  Wow.  My import.  Right.  The gas sucks.  Yeah.  Let's go to Ron the Trucker.  Ron?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  I'm pretty good.  What's up?  Hey, Rock.  Hey, sweet.  Say, I wanted to find out if Wheelchair Fred would sing some Joe Cocker for us. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, boy.  I swear to God.  You got no talent.  Yeah, you have a talent, all right.  Do you know that song, I Get By With A Little Shit In My Tub?  I Get By With A Little Shit In My Tub.  Come on, I need to get up.  I think he's saying, honey, get up.  All right. 
[01:52:00]  Hey, Pete from Connecticut, what do you have?  Yeah, I'm sitting in my car here waiting for Frank from Jersey to start singing The Rainbow  Connection.  A lot of people saying that Frank sounds like Kermit.  Really?  Yeah, where's Frank from Jersey again?  I didn't notice that.  Where did he go?  He's off again.  Where does he keep going to?  Finding another soiled bathroom to clean.  Yeah, that's a lot of people calling in with that one, so.  Let's use a good storyteller, though.  That was crazy.  We just woke up.  I woke up and there was shit in the... 
[01:52:30]  It's like a Sesame Street character.  She is for cripple.  Me spread cookies, yeah.  All right, here's Fred.  Frank, I'm sorry.  Frank.  Yes.  So, um...  Oh, he's got Wheelchair Fred's donation box.  Very good.  Yeah, you got them.  Yeah, I just went out to get it for him, yeah.  He does sound like Kermit.  Who do people say you sound like, Frank? 
[01:53:00]  I don't know.  I call the show all the time, but I haven't heard anybody sound like me.  Did you guys know around the set that Jim was gay, or did you have no idea?  He has no idea what's going on because he went outside to get the donation box.  Oh, that thing is feeding back.  Yeah, watch out, that mic.  Yeah.  A hot mic, hot mic. 
[01:53:30]  I walked into something that I'm not ready for.  I don't know what's going on, guys.  What do you think you walked into, Frank?  Something fun, but I'm part of it.  Yeah, yeah.  So what happened this morning?  You kind of knew that he had an action.  How did you know?  I smelled something real bad.  I thought something...  I don't know.  I said, what the hell happened?  So I knocked on the door for it, came out, and I said, it's like a horror story from  like one of those movies, you know?  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Why did we pick up on this?  Wait, did you know that something...  How did you know?  Did you know that something was wrong when he said today's show was sponsored by the letter  A?  Accident.  I'm fucked.  Yeah.  I'm fucked.  I'm definitely...  Something's going on here.  Language.  How long did it take you to clean up the mess?  Yeah.  About half an hour.  Yeah.  And did Paul Bentley from the Jeffersons come in and do a little vignette in between?  Hey, that's good. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Very good.  Okay.  Now, was he embarrassed about it or no?  Yeah.  What was his reaction?  Yeah, we didn't get his reaction.  Did you yell at him and say, Fred, what did you do?  No, he goes to me and says, Frank, clean it up.  That's it.  Wow.  He told you to clean up his crap?  No, no, no, no.  He...  He...  He...  He...  He...  Wow.  He was a little embarrassed, but...  Did he think that nobody could see it like Snuffleupagus?  No, just a lot. 
[01:55:00]  I was embarrassed.  Yeah.  You were embarrassed?  All right.  Let me...  We got to talk to Pat from Boston.  He has something on, Frank.  Wait.  Did you...  How many turds were there?  Did you hear him going, there's one turd?  Ha, ha, ha.  One, two, three, four, five.  Five turds.  He still has no idea.  Were there maybe a few turds sprinkled around there, and maybe one didn't look like the 
[01:55:30]  rest?  No.  No.  It looked like a scene out of that...  One of these things.  Dumb and dumber.  It's not like the other.  The guy had shit all over the wall, the mirror.  It was just awful.  Well, did you know how to get here, or did you have to say to somebody, won't you tell  me how to get...  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Thank you.  All right.  Pat from Boston has something on the line here.  Pat, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hi, Daddy.  Anyway, that fact, Frank, basically was bothering everyone in line yesterday, showing this picture 
[01:56:00]  of him and Anthony, and about how right before he took that picture, he wiped snot on his  hand, and really caught Anthony good.  Bunching out.  He would never do that.  No, that was my wife back in Asbury Park.  That wasn't me.  That wasn't me.  Ah, right.  That was the Asbury Park there.  I think I ruined...  She ruined it for everybody.  It wasn't me.  Although I wouldn't be able to see a booger on his finger.  It's all green.  That's similar.  Wait, did you wipe a booger on your hand and shake Anthony's hand?  No, no, no.  This is the deal. 
[01:56:30]  On your thumb and three fingers?  Back in the old show on NEW, they had a road trip to Asbury Park, and everybody was stone  drunk.  We're going to Asbury Park, yeah!  Wait, you're making me laugh.  All right, go ahead.  Tell the story, Frank.  So my wife was guzzling everything that she could find, and...  She was acting like a piggy. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand.  I understand.  So Miss Piggy, she was foamy at the mouth, and Anthony just pops up out of nowhere, and  she's a huge fan, so she just grabbed Anthony with her hand and didn't realize that snot 
[01:57:30]  was dripping all over, and Anthony was pretty good about it.  He didn't really...  She was good about it because she didn't know.  I didn't know.  I would have freaked out.  You would have freaked out.  It was awful.  It was like greenish, yellow stuff.  It was awful.  It's not easy being green.  I understand completely, sir.  Frank, do you have any clue what's going on here?  Oh, gee.  No.  Not until about a few hours later when I hear the replay.  I don't know.  I know.  I'm digging deep here. 
[01:58:00]  No, you're doing good.  We'll just chat, man.  You're like...  No worries.  Wait till I get home.  I'm going to be in trouble.  She's got the Wi-Fi, you know, so...  Oh, yeah.  That's terrific.  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  Well, we've been just fucking around.  We're not trying to be like a bunch of grouches.  There you go.  He has no idea.  All right.  We're live from the paradise.  We finally got to take this break.  When we come back, we've got four contestants that are going to try to win a Wi-Fi.  Because the show is sponsored by the litter, M.  Hit the spots. 
[01:58:30]  We'll be back, Steve.  Thank you.  Oh, Jim Henson's dead and gone. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, Jim Henson's dead and gone.  But his Muppets will live on.  And Kermit's still hot, cause it's still not easy being green.  Bird is mad, cause Zerny can't hear. 
[01:59:30]  With a banana in his ear.  They must learn how to cooperate.  Yeah, the count is counting one, two, three.  And no one laughs at poor Fozzie.  And Scooter's pissed, cause Rolf is always late.  Oh, Jim Henson's dead and gone. 
[02:00:00]  But his Muppets will live on.  And Kermit's still hot, cause it's still not easy being.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.  Now, Miss Piggy's just a big slab of pork  To the Swedish chef, who says pork, pork, pork 
[02:00:30]  And cookie monster wants another bite  Yeah, and Big Bird, well, he just can't see  Why the two old guys in the balcony  Thinks not for long, but guesses out of sight  Oh, Jim Henson's dead and gone  But his Muppets will live on  And Kermit's still hot, cause it's still not easy being green 
[02:01:00]  Oh, Jim Henson's dead and gone  But his Muppets will live on  And Kermit's still hot, cause it's still not easy being green  Easy being green, though  Like sands through the hourglass

Yeah  A little sex going on and stuff?  Yeah  Yeah, there you go  That's nice  Do you use condoms?  It depends  She's on the pill, so it makes no difference  Yeah, what's it depend on?  What does it depend on?  Don't use them, come on, be a man  Why would you use them, man?  Here's what you've got to do  After you dump your guard  Jerry Mike just finished another one  All right  There goes that line 
[02:20:00]  Thanks, Kenny  I want to know why he  Why do you wear condoms  You know, sometimes  Well  Like when she gets off the rag I wear  Just in case she's still bleeding  Why?  Yeah  Why?  Like, who cares?  Yeah, get some more ketchup on that egg  Why?  Why?  Because you don't want to get all messed up?  Not really  No, good man  Why?  Go right in  No, you know, you pull off the condom  You throw it in her hair  And you go, adios, motherfucker  Jesus 
[02:20:30]  No  First days off premium, sorry  I like  I like pulling it out  And having it look like  The Battle of the Bulls took place  Just  Nothing but a wooded area  And blood  Or you put a baseball shoe on it  And you go, look, game seven  Yeah, I just want to say  You can find the pictures  I'm taking on  Eatabullet.com  Oh, good man  Even that plug bothered me  Yeah

[02:22:00]  That's nice  Well, that's what your boyfriend said  Security Mike just finished another one  Good for Mike  What is he up to?  He's on his sixth  He's done five  Security Mike is good  Mike has eaten five of these awful sandwiches  Yep  That Anthony bought for everyone  Yes  No problem  I'll do it again if I  I ate one earlier, too  Huh?  He ate one earlier, too  Oh, okay  He actually ate one because he wanted to  Yes  Well, you know  You're getting your dollars worth  These sandwiches cost me a buck 
[02:22:30]  Better enjoy  What's that noise?  What was that?  It's a McGriddle  It's disgusting  It's a McGriddle?  What, you've changed to something else?  Oh, that looks like a luscious sausage patty  There you are  A sandwich between two hotcakes  Is it good?  No  No  It's awful  It's awful  It reminds me of my abusive childhood 
[02:23:00]  When my father would throw whiskey bottles at me  Yeah  And I sweat a lot  If I didn't, I'd explode  Yeah  That's good  Well, they're going at it  Whose idea was it to go over five minutes?  Jimmy's?  Yeah  We had to  This was Jimmy's brilliant idea  We were going to have  First of all, we're killing time  And second of all  That's what's really important here  What, you guys want to do five minutes and recap for an hour?  Remember when he ate the third one? 
[02:23:30]  I know  I thought it was the second one  You nut  I told you it was the third  You were right again  Back after this  We would have had a four-way tie  They all would have eaten three  We would have had to redo it  And some kind of sandwich off  Okay  What is that private tie?  Sir, jelly donuts, sir  Open your mouth  They're paying for it  You eat it  Security Mike just finished another one  Security Mike's on fire 
[02:24:00]  Wow  He's really coming on hard  He's eating six of these things?  Yeah, six  All right  That's the end of six right there?  Because you are a disgusting fat body, private pile  Now lean forward and choke yourself  Don't pull my fucking hand over there  I said choke yourself  Now choke yourself  God damn it with my shit-covered dildo 
[02:24:30]  Well, there he goes  Do your parents have any children that live?  Sir, yes, sir  How about they regret that?  Security Mike's starting to sweat  Well, let's see  Anyone getting close to puking, Kenny?  I've been close after the first one  All right  You at best un-fuck yourself  Or I will unscrew your head and chip down your neck  How you doing, Scott? 
[02:25:00]  Security Mike can puke at any time, by the way  I hate Jamaicans  Well, no shit  What's your name, fat body?  What side was that private pile?  Sir, left side, sir  Are you sure, private pile?  Sir, yes, sir  What side was that private pile?  Sir, right side, sir  This is so stupid  Oh, those are the best clips  I want that head so sanitary and squared away 
[02:25:30]  That the Virgin Mary herself would be proud to go in there and take a dump  No, she's fine  Oh, you okay?  By the way, there's a problem with Vanessa  Vanessa is fine  Vanessa?  Wait, Vanessa, what's going on?  I'm fine, I'm worried about him  Really?  Yeah  Oh, Vanessa moved out of the way because she thinks security Mike's going to puke very soon  Mike, is that true?  No, he's fine  Oh, he's gagging  I've got a couple more on him  I think he's gagging  He's got a couple more on him, he's all right  But Vanessa has moved away from the table 
[02:26:00]  She's very scared that Mike's going to puke on her  Keep the pile there  Puke, puke, puke  Yeah  Why, you little maggot?  You make me want to vomit  All right  Vanessa is moving back to the table, Anthony  She's back in the contest  That was a rough one for her  She thought she was going to get covered in vomit  Mike just stood under his pants  Did he really?  Making more room, all right  Are you about to call me an asshole? 
[02:26:30]  All right, this is going on forever  This is hard  Yeah, it was Jimmy's idea  Where's Jimmy?  He left  He left the contest  What happened?  He had to take a leak  Where did he go?  He put the...  What?  Oh, okay  It was his idea and then he runs off  God damn  Now we get to sit here uncomfortably  Now we get to sit here and watch an eating contest on the radio  Right  Fan-fucking-tastic  Couldn't ask for more 
[02:27:00]  This is the type of radio you're going to get when it's Norton and Friends  Maybe we can...  Maybe anybody on the phone with anything interesting?  No, not really  Well, let's go to Alabama  Calls from Alabama are always interesting  Coot  It's Coot from Alabama  What's up, Coot?  Hey, man, this is first time caller, man  You guys are great  Thank you, Coot  Yeah, your buddy there talking about this Vanessa lady 
[02:27:30]  I guess he's got to use a condom for everything  I don't guess he's got his red wings, does he?  Uh, he didn't earn his red wings if he's wearing a condom when you're, you know  Oh, you're into that, uh, red wing thing there, Coot  Yeah, he ain't doing no mug diving on, I guess, then  No, during that time?  Yeah, do you guys like crime scene sex, or  Are you into the crime scene sex?  Yeah  Yeah, you come out with blood on your nose  Wait, Jimmy has, uh, Jimmy wants to talk to Coot  Go ahead, Jimmy  Oh 
[02:28:00]  Mike  Is it on?  Mike  Um, we've actually done it before  And, like, not thinking she would bleed as much  She bled all over my sheets  Scared the shit out of me  So we had to throw the sheets away  And change the bed  Hoping my parents didn't notice  Yeah  Wow, I'm sure Vanessa wanted the whole room to know that, Jimmy  You're a real treat  After you got out of bed  Did you give Johnny Fontaine the part in the picture?  All right, guys, y'all have a good show 
[02:28:30]  Appreciate it  All right  Chubby  Chubby Mike just finished another one  There you go, Mike  All right, Mike  Chubby Mike  Oh, sorry  It's Mike from Belmont  Okay  I don't think we ought to call him Chubby Mike  Exactly  It doesn't quite cover it  I got a little weight problem  A lot of sandwiches  A lot of sandwiches  Swallowed a lot of aggression  And a lot of egg sandwiches  A movie on this flight  Jimmy, you still think this was a good idea to keep going? 
[02:29:00]  Yes  Only my fourth  This is my fourth  After this  Shut your mouth and keep eating  Stop making your concession speech  Concession speech  You eat until you puke  You eat until you puke  Or we come over there  Seven  Who's up to seven?  Who's up to seven?  Security Mike  How many is Vanessa on?  Vanessa, which one is that you're on?  Six  She slowed way down though  Yeah, but she knows he's going to puke soon  That's her strategy  Ah, she's waiting for him to puke  Absolutely  Good point  He's going to puke 
[02:29:30]  I'm waiting  Do you think so?  That's good  She's got a strategy  Why do we have no video camera up here?  Because there's nothing going on  That's a point  And a man in my position  Can't afford to be made to look ridiculous  Wheelchair Fred is cheering Vanessa on  Still over there  Of course  She is  Good girl  All right, well  This is  He's getting closer  Not like he can play footsies  I'm going to play a little wheelsy with you

Oh, no  He just put Fred's dildo on his plate  Oh, great  Now he's going to puke with a heart on it

[02:33:00]  He's got the colic  There he goes  He's still eating  Wow  I think standing up helped him out  Yeah  He's flipping his head back with every bite  Like a bird  Like a pelican  He's putting a fish down his throat  Well  He's on seven, right?

Yeah it's actually pretty good  Hold on let me throw it in here  All right yeah  We love the assaults  Derek's got it  Derek's got it  Hold on  We love the assault  On the media thing  Of course  I guess the cameraman  Was really quick  And was able to move  The camera real fast 
[02:45:30]  Yeah yeah  But who was this?  Donkey Sausage?  The kids from Whackbag  The gang from Whackbag  Did this one  The gang from Whackbag  Online tonight  A pair of bleacher seats  Are starting at around $400  Grandstand seats at $700  And box seats at $1,000 or more  All five to ten times the face value  So who can afford it?  Seven's Aaron Logan is live outside Fenway  Aaron?  Uh oh  Lauren that's right  Tickets already selling at five to ten times face value 
[02:46:00]  In their gold trim uniforms  Unless you two had some sort of celebrity uniform  Looks like you may have some  O and A party rock was the battle cry  They just came running out of nowhere  At this reporter  Very good  Very professional reporter  Yeah  Kept going  Well Steve that was  That killed 30 seconds  I liked that  Alright  Can you mix that with the Pat O'Brien tape maybe?  We'll get on that Jimmy  Let's see 
[02:46:30]  You want to play the Michael Jackson remix?  How long is that?  It's about a minute and a half  Did it stretch it to five?  Yeah  Hey you got any sound clips that are 58 and a half minutes?  Yeah you'll get on that  We are bombing live Steve  This is the most uncomfortable radio program we've ever done in our lives  I can tell you I saw Spamalot the other day  Oh how was your Broadway experience?  Actually I loved it  And that's why I stayed back  That's why I stayed back 
[02:47:00]  Because I had $200 tickets to go see Spamalot the other day  And I wasn't about to give them up  And it's a great show  Okay very good  Alright  Wow we held them at bay for three hours Ophie  And now they're turning  And I don't  They're yelling that you're a fag Steve  And I don't blame them at this point  Hey Steve why don't we play the Michael Jackson thing?  Alright  Set this up again  What is this?  It was when Michael Jackson was on trial for molestation  You're talking way too fast Steve  Slow down  Sorry  When Michael Jackson was on trial 
[02:47:30]  Or at least being accused of molestation ten years ago  He made that  Perfect diction  Thank you  When he made that statement to the press  When he had been examined by the  Was it forensic examiners I guess?  Where he described in detail how they touched his private parts  And his genitals and his buttocks  And someone took it upon themselves to remix the entire thing  And we found it this morning  And intrepid Nathaniel cut it up a little bit 
[02:48:00]  Are we suggesting that maybe other listeners do this?  Yes I think this would be an excellent idea  Maybe some Michael Jackson remixes in the near future?  I think that's an excellent idea  I'd say some Michael Jackson remixes within the next 15 minutes  Yeah start writing people  Yes email them to ben.sparks at xmradio.com  No cockpictures  Right  Because he hates that  Derek  I am doing well and I am strong  As you may already know after my tour ended 
[02:48:30]  I remain out of the country undergoing treatment for a dependency on children all over the world  I love thousands upon thousands of children to view and photograph my body  Including my horrifying penis  My disgusting buttocks  My lower torso  Thighs  And any other error that they wanted  A horrifying nightmare  No person should ever have to view and photograph my body  Including my disgusting penis  And even after experiencing the indignity  Of my buttocks 
[02:49:00]  My lower torso  Thighs  I ask all of you to wait and hear the truth  If I am guilty of anything  It is of gaining sheer joy  From seeing children with my disgusting penis  It is of loving children of all ages and races  It is of gaining sheer joy  From seeing children submit to a dehumanizing  And humiliating examination by God  I do try to be God-like 
[02:49:30]  Come unto me  I am God  Come unto my buttocks  Come unto my lower torso  Come unto my penis  It brings tears to my eyes  When I see the Los Angeles Police Department subjected  To all of the false allegations being made  By the incredible, terrible mass media  And there you go  Oh, very good  That wasn't bad  I liked that  They liked that one  Not bad, not bad  Maybe we'll get some other ones in the future  Who did that?  That was us  I think Ricky found that online, actually  And brought to the 
[02:50:00]  What was he looking for?  We had him looking for news clips  Who wants to hear it again?  And we have Tom Sizemore clips  Yeah, we have  I guess Sizemore was doing very well  In his acting career  In a few pretty big movies  You know  What was he in?  Saving Private Ryan  Always played the gruff sergeant type  You know  And he has this  I don't know  Crazy little hobby  Of beating women  So  He also had the fake penis 
[02:50:30]  To pass his drug test, right?  Yeah, because he's got drug problems  And they usually end up  You know, you do your drugs  You beat your women  You get arrested  And then they put you on a drug program  Sure  And then he had that fake penis  Because they look at you  When you take a leak  To drug test  So you had this whole thing  That warms up the urine  And you pull out a fake rubber schlong  And you pee  And it looks like a real schlong  And if Fred isn't backing into it  You can then pee in the cup  And give it to the guy  So they found him using this fake penis 
[02:51:00]  And gave him more time  He was in the court  And I hear he got a little upset  How much time does he have to do?  Not as long as this next hour  Is going to seem for us  But  I think  I don't know if he was sentenced yet  Oh  He was found guilty though  Ooh  Alright  Do we have that, Stephen?  Yeah, it's right here  Derek  I made  Egregious  Mistakes  In the choices I made  And for that, Your Honor 
[02:51:30]  I am sorry  And that's how I would break my father's heart  Or my mom  Or mine  But I have  And I'm going to wait for that  What I did was wrong  You can act like a man  What's the matter with you?  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Steve, I want to hear the one where he says he's a sissy 
[02:52:00]  Where he's a sissy?  Yeah, I think it's track two  Is there a track two on that, Derek?  Derek's telling me there's no track two  Hold on  Oh  Fire him  No, we got it  Hold on  Who's Derek?  Did they hire new people while we were away?  Here it is  I got it  Alright  I don't know why people believe it  I'm an actor  I pretend  I wear makeup for a living  I'm a sissy  Wow, what was that? 
[02:52:30]  Steve, what was that one?  A clip of an interview  And then him crying in court?  Did you do that, Nathaniel?  Hold on  Oh, the fans getting creative  Are they improv-ing?  Did Nathaniel get a little creative?  No  No, that was straight out of Dateline  That was just their editing job  Him saying a sissy  And they cut right to him being in court crying  Wow  They're wacky over there at Dateline  Alright  That's what that was  Alright, let's go to the next track  Thank God there's 28 of these tracks  Tom Sizemore unplugged 
[02:53:00]  You cried in court  And then you, you know, gave the finger to the press  Excuse me  No, sir  But you cried in the press  Was that acting?  I'm not acting right now  I said the press  I know  Go back to court  How were you in there?  Well, I was my brokenhearted  My poor mother and poor father out there  And they're both aging  And my mother's almost dead  Watching their eldest son  The, uh  I'm depressed 
[02:53:30]  I'm done  Whoa, careful, careful  We're going to carry the chair with you all the way  Yeah, I saw that clip  He got up and walked out  And he still had his mic and everything  All the wires hooked up  And it hooked on the chair  And he's walking in the chairs  Following him  It was really awkward  Much like  Well  Looks like we have more tracks  Well, thank God  Well, one more, right?  Yeah  Okay, let's hear the next  You know what I want back? 
[02:54:00]  I want the two years and ten months back  Of anxiety  I want my mother's heart attack  Back  I want  All the pain and suffering  My family's gone through back  I want my good name back  All right  I want it all back  Can they give it back to me?  They can make an attempt  It's called money  To make me whole  And I want a billion dollars  I think it's a fair amount  It's a round number  I'll sell it for a hundred million  That was actually audio of Howard negotiating in Sirius 
[02:54:30]  And he got it  All right, well  Steve, anything else in New York today?  Not this  Please  Did you find something?  A Jim Brewer bit?  Something?  Oh, yeah  Yeah, in terms of lovely comedy bits  Yes, we have a whole pile of them  We might have to end this mess early  I don't think so  You know what we have?  We have those Jim Norton things that Danny did 
[02:55:00]  Those Pat O'Brien, Jim Norton things  I like the interns are all motivated  Well, we got new ones to play when we get back to New York?  I think so  I think that's what Danny just handed me  He's looking at me like  He doesn't know what I'm talking about  Because he's on the phone  We'll get him off the phone  Because we need those clips  Hey, Dan  Oh, here we go  Look at me  Steve and Danny talking to each other  Thank you so much, you fucking drunk  Hey

[02:56:00]  Kurt Long  Hey, how you doing?  Wow, look at the  Kurt, you've got a lot of fans here at the Paradise  I have a lot of their pro fans  That's right  Wow  Wow  No way, you guys are making a mistake  They're thinking you're Kurt Waldheim  They're thinking of a porn star  Kurt  Ah, well, you have the last name for it  Probably  Yeah  He's taking identity 
[02:56:30]  Kurt Long  Well, you know something?  A lot of people, big Kurt Long fans  But for the people that don't know what you do  Why don't you let everybody in on who Kurt Long is?  Um, I'm a host of a show on GSN  Network for Games  I'm sure you've all read it  All right, a lot of people are fans of GSN  But for the few people that don't know  Why don't you let them in on what that is?  GSN is a network that used to show just only old game shows  That they bought from other people  Oh, I remember that 
[02:57:00]  Yeah  What's that?  You could always catch an episode of Family Feud or Match Game  That's right  I liked watching, like, Match Game 75  Yeah, those old Family Feuds, the Smiths versus the Yates  Oh, yeah  You know, Richard Dawson contracts lip herpes every show  Right  Kissing every contestant he can  Exactly  It's somewhat disturbing  We actually didn't think you were going to call in  Because Ben has had, like, a weird list of guests  We're actually happy you called in 
[02:57:30]  We didn't think it was going to happen  Yeah  Well, I'm a Boston native, which is why I wanted to call in  You are?  Yeah, I went to Emerson College out there  Partied as a paradise many times  Ah, there you go  And I used to listen to you folks when you were back on some other crappy network in Boston  Oh, BCN  AAF or BCN?  AAF, was it?  AAF, back in the old days  Back in the day  Back in the olden days  So, well, you're from Boston, very excited about the Red Sox?  I'm very excited 
[02:58:00]  Yeah  In fact, this past year has been amazing  Yeah  I remember 86  I was 14, I was at a party  I was about to hook up with this girl  Yeah  We were waiting for the game to end  And she lost the mood once the ball went through Buckner's legs  Really?  So I've had blue balls for about 15, 16 years now  So  Okay, we were finally out the last year  That's terrific  I can't  That's terrific 
[02:58:30]  Yeah  So, Kurt, what time is your program on?  I'm on Saturdays  The show's called Games Across America  Yeah  It's on Saturdays from 9 to midnight  We go across the country to find the weirdest, craziest games and competitions we can find  And what, like what?  Like, give us an example  Rock, paper, scissors, world championship  You mean  Yeah  Oh, they love it  People love rock, paper, scissors here  You've got to do an insanity to see this kind of crap 
[02:59:00]  Swamp buggy races  Wait, what is a swamp  Wait, what is a swamp buggy race?  You've got to go slow  Swamp buggy races are in, um  Are in, uh  Naples, Florida  A bunch of rednecks  Good people  And, uh, they just, uh  They build their own swamp buggies  For no money at all  They don't, they don't, uh  Right  No shit  But they drive around a swamp  And, uh  Right  Whoever survives it 
[02:59:30]  Wins  But they put, like, $100,000  Kill yourself  Into the  Wow, really  That much  Now your show  You kind of do, like, little rejoiners, right?  Like, it's over a three-hour period  But you guys are kind of  What are you kind of cutting into?  Like, in between  We kind of  Like you said  The match game marathon  On Saturday nights  We wrap around that block  Oh, exactly  Yeah  You know what I mean?  We do, uh  You know, we're trying to get a half-hour show going  But who knows  It's, uh  It's GSN  I'm just happy that they're doing  Some sort of original programming 
[03:00:00]  And  I get things to do it  Have you got any kind of recognition?  Like, where are you  Based out of?  Are you based out of L.A.?  I'm based out of L.A.  I don't care  And, uh  It's really  Fucking early  Yeah, I know  What time is it out there?

[03:01:30]  I put on a Red Sox uniform  And gave it to him  While his little hat  Fell off his bald head  Jesus Christ, Jimmy  That's, um  That's disturbing  What is the most popular game  Because I've actually watched  The GSN  Yes  Um  What is the most popular game  Like to be replayed  I would say  The $25,000 pyramid  The most popular game  That I've covered  Or on the network  Uh, I would say  On  I would say  On the network  What's the most popular game  And what is it about it 
[03:02:00]  That you like  Um  I'd say  Dodgeball  Is probably the most popular  They, uh  They like, uh  Hitting people with things  I like, uh  People diving around  Getting  Smacked in the head  And  Stuff like that  The craziest thing I covered  Was  Frozen Dead Guy Days  This crazy event in Colorado  Where they actually celebrate  A guy who froze his grandfather  In his tool shed  Hello

And I thought she was mad  I thought she was asleep  Because I looked  You know, you start with like  You start slowly  You know what I mean?  And then you're like  Well, I've got to get some friction going  Well, what happened?  So I turn around  Because he's on the countdown  I get some friction going 
[03:04:30]  Well, at first I was like  Whoa, hey  Look at this  That old cartoon  That at first you could be in the mode like  I don't want to be bothered  It's so much work  Maybe  And then the second you're getting into it  It's like  Why am I not doing this all the time?  Why am I not quitting my job  And doing this full time?  So when it really started  You know, I started getting into her  I looked behind me  To make sure, you know  She's still asleep 
[03:05:00]  And she was asleep  But Louie  Would you give her a little pee crack  Would you give her the fish eye?  Oh, yeah  I turned around  Yeah  I was like  I'll be with the fish eye  Oh, wait a minute  You got to understand  She was two feet  She was two feet behind me  You're very quiet  You get the quiet method  And now I got  You're quiet  Just the thumb movement  Just the thumb movement  Just the thumb movement  Just the thumb movement  Just the thumb movement  Just maybe like the inside right here  Like the wrist area  Yeah  Thumb movement  Light movement  And pressure  With the pinky  Ring  And middle finger  So then I adjust the pillow

[03:19:30]  Heavy metal jerk.  When you get bangin' your head, leather of your spouse kind of jerk.  We're talkin' love, fights, screamin' for vengeance.  Love a jerk.  Rubber gags and zippers.  We're talkin' run to the hills, master of puppets jerkin'.  Master, master, master of jerkin' is pullin' the trades.  I know Jack from Philly checkin' in. 
[03:20:00]  He says, there's no way out of it when you get caught beatin' it.  But there is a way to minimize the damage.  Look her right in the eye while still stroking and say,  Look what you're makin' me do!  Look what you're makin' me do!  Get down on your knees and start cryin'.  Look right now, man!  Look what I'm doing!  What have you brought me to?  I got no place else to Jack!  I got no place else to Jack!  Don't you make me stop doin' this! 
[03:20:30]  Don't you!  I got no place else to Jack!  I ain't got nothin'.  Home run.  And I believe that would be the close-up.  That's the officer and a gentleman!  That's the Richard Gid jerk!  Oh, God.  Wow!  That hurt.  But, Roy, you were under the influence.  You were jamming Judas Priest or something. 
[03:21:00]  I can't get through this story.  That's fine.  You kidding.  Ah, we get the image.  Just a visual of you coming downstairs and music's cracking your eye naked.  Oh, dude.  I wasn't naked!  Was this before or after that other episode?  See, don't be stark.  But you have to be naked, too.  I had my underwear on.  Now, is this before or after the other episode you just talked about?  Oh, this is after.  Oh, man.  So she must have been like...  Didn't we talk about this? 
[03:21:30]  Honestly, what I did, I pulled that as a front.  I'm going to get downstairs and write, you know.  Living at the midnight, rock it like a rainbow in the dark.  All right, you have a little concert.  I'm tearing it up in my basement.  And then, you know, I wait until she falls into the story, keep it going, and then...  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um. 
[03:22:00]  Well, you know, came down, and again.  Oh, no.  You're right.  There is no thrown in jail for the night.  There is no, uh, can we ask you some questions?  Yeah.  You're thrown on the stand immediately.  Blink!  What the hell are you going to say to me just?  Is there a problem?  I've got to go that route.  The problem. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Then now there must be a problem.  Um.  God damn, that's funny.  That's it.  That's, that's...  It's not getting better than that today, right?  There you go.  Jerking.  Bravo.  Oh.  Wow.  I can't...  Well...  I haven't laughed that hard.  It's embarrassing, man.  It certainly does.  But I get...  I usually get madder.  I'm like, well, you know.  Don't walk around.  You know that gets me.  Well, can't you control it?  No!  I cannot!  That is why I've got to run in high! 
[03:23:00]  It is worse than heroin!  When are you females going to realize that?  It's a gene!  It's a fluid in our body!  You show us anything, and we...  Immediately, it's like, where can I go?  Woo!  Woo!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Really?  Like an ape, yeah.  Throw my feces.  Come on.  You're all lying if it's not the truth.  No, it is absolutely the truth.  Oh, God.  That's too good. 
[03:23:30]  All right.  How many people are going to do the Judas Priest jerk now?  See?  There you go.  The Judas Priest jerk!  Yeah.  We better take a break, huh?  All right.  Jesus Christ.  I have a blast.  Too much fun.  And more on the way.  Ian Anthony, XM202.  Bro, can I tell you something?  What?  Because you've been telling me for years, or a few years now, Tracy Morgan is off the hook.  Isn't he crazy?  The guy is beyond funny.  I'm telling you.  Beyond funny.  Beyond funny.  Just like yourself.  Yo, Jimmy, yo. 
[03:24:00]  Jimmy raging against the machine, yo.  You know when they be taking your donkey, be jerking, yo.  Your toes be all up and off.  Yo, Opie.  Is all that.  I'm Brian Fellow.  Look at that.  Hey, you've got to be doing the blow.  Who coming down the paddle?  All you white people who have never had nappy dugout.  Nappy dugout.  He was inviting all the white guys to go to Harlem to get banged by young black girls.  He used to try to hook me up.  It was hilarious. 
[03:24:30]  He's like, make sure your permission slips are signed by your parents.  I live in the Bronx.  And form a line at the door.  We're going up to Harlem for some of that skanky nappy dugout.  I live in the Bronx because I keep it real.  Yo, man, don't be wearing no condos.  Don't be wearing no condos.  Unbelievable.  He goes, if you're scared, get a dog.  You scared of me?  You scared?  You scared?  Get a dog.  Get a dog.  Get a dog.  You scared of me?  Who's he talking to?  Who's he talking to?  Actually, he was talking to my girlfriend's friend. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he was like, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  You know, I want you to have my daughter.  He goes, that's a compliment where I come from.  He goes, that's a compliment.  I won't get you pregnant.  I won't get you pregnant.  You scared?  You look scared now.  You scared?  Get a dog.  Get a dog.  Get a dog.  That's a compliment.  Get a dog.  That's a compliment where I come from.  Get a dog.  I'm talking to you.  You got them child-bearing hips.  I like that.  Come here, baby.  Let me just touch that. 
[03:25:30]  Papi.  Papi.  Hello, mama.  Hello, mama.  Papi.  He was out of his mind.  And you ask who was he talking to?  Most of the time, we don't know.  No, he's just...  We don't know.  He just walks up and down the hallway.  He should do the SNL.  He'd be like, yo, Sherry be losing her mind, yo.  You think anybody care?  No.  Oh, yeah.  He talks about Sherry O'Perry.  It's hysterical.  Yeah.  She had a good butt.  Yo, I wanted to care.  She didn't even know it.  She all fine. 
[03:26:00]  She didn't even know it.  She was walking around with a yum-yums, walking around with a yum-yums on writing day.  Writing day, she'd come have them new gray yum-yums, be showing just above pew blinds.  Just above the equator, yo.  Just above the equator.  And he did this for hours.  Startle you.  He pulls his shoe off in a sock, and he goes, yeah, would a girl be giving you...  Yeah.  He's like, yeah, and your toes be doing this.  And he's got his shoes and socks on. 
[03:26:30]  And he's curling his toes up, and he's going, oh!  Oh, and he's laying on his back, and then he flips over on his stomach, goes, and then  she starts, and he's like, yeah, you're just doing it.  We used to watch, we used to share a room, man.  We'd turn off the lights, and he'd always have, like, crazy, crazy porn.  We were talking, me and I, man.  Me and Tracy were addicted to porn.  We'd be hanging out in there, but he'd love, like, eight-year-old Jim, watch, watch  my toes be curled up, man.  Toes be curled up.  Yeah, curling up.  That's what I'm talking about. 
[03:27:00]  Can't kill Dable.  Kill that nigga.  Over Jealousy.  Yeah, yeah.  He'd just come out with stuff like that.  Took the nigga out.  You know, when your toes be curled up, when you're just about to see your love come out.  He'd kill that nigga.  Over Jealousy, yo.  That's wrong.  Yo, John, be our man, yo.  Had all the confidence in the world, man.  He has great references, too.  If you ever hung out with him, he brings up some great stuff when we were kids.  He used to talk about, remember the Gargantuans?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, in the movie Gargantuans?  War of the Gargantuans, yeah.  He would come in and reenact that every day. 
[03:27:30]  He could, yo, Jim, remember when the brown Gargantuans be going, mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  And the green one.  With his hand, mm-mm.  And he helped the green one out.  Helped him out.  Because his blood can't kill nigga.  He wanted the Gargantuans, yo.  His toes weren't filled up, yo.  He'd be Gargantuans.  Mm-mm.  I mean, no.  What is he talking about?  What the hell is Tracy talking about?  I'm laughing my ass off.  What the hell is he talking about?  We'll be bugging.  He left, yo.  He should have had it, yo. 
[03:28:00]  Had it.  You're Dalham and stupid.  I'm stupid.  Lost his head, man.  We couldn't get him back.  Couldn't get him back.  Because King killed that nigga.  At one point, Tracy comes over, and he's just going off, and he's gawking at all the girls  and the strippers.  Yeah, look at that.  That's nice.  That's what I'm talking about.  And my girlfriend's sitting up on the back of the dugout seat, and I'm standing in front  of her, and Tracy looks over, and goes, ooh, what we got here?  Yeah.  And he leans over to kiss her on the side of her thigh, and I slip my hand, and I go, ah, 
[03:28:30]  ah, ah.  And he lays a kiss on my swatch, like I had just gotten my arm in there in time, before  she was fouled by Tracy Morgan.  Laugh at her ass as well.  Tony, he's the funniest human being I ever hung out with.  Yeah.  Because you've been telling us for a while, like, eh.  He makes me belly laugh.  But now, I'm with you now, man.  Hard.  With you, big time.  You've got to tell a story about the, um, you were in Harlem with him or something, and 
[03:29:00]  there's a, you saw a dude get shot, we, when I was doing Uptown Comedy Club, I had no, you  know, I came from the island, man.  And I must say that place, you know that, don't change it, Jamaica, crap.  Oh, when you're from Long Island.  You're going to change it, Jamaica, man.  I mean, you got, you see four black people, like, oh, no, I'm going to get raped.  And they're going to shoot me in the back of my head, and then go home and bang my mother.  You know, the Long Island Railroad, you know what I mean?  That's a message.  Black people, oh, my God, he's black. 
[03:29:30]  The Long Island Railroad, yes, gives a message for all the white boys on Long Island.  They're talking just to us when they say, don't change it, Jamaica.  Yeah, don't change it, Jamaica.  Stay on the train.  They ain't talking to anyone else.  They're talking to the white boys from Valley Stream.  Exactly.  And Centerport and Greenlawn.  Exactly.  When you are from Long Island, or I guess this works for any suburb of a major city.  I'm going to talk Detroit or anywhere, Chicago.  When you leave Long Island to go to New York City, you get on Long Island guy defensive mode, 
[03:30:00]  which is just, it's nothing.  Yeah.  And you know it.  Yep.  You go to New York City, and especially when you're growing up, once you get there, you're  just like, all right, watch my back, guys.  Everyone, like you're a pack of these tough guys that are going to do anything.  You're driving in?  You're driving in?  I ain't driving in.  I'm not driving in.  You guys can go drive in.  But I drive in.  Jerry went twice last year, and it was stolen twice.  Explain that. 
[03:30:30]  And when they found it two weeks later in Newark, I don't want to make references of what you  know I took it, lines with tiggers, but there was a basketball, and the tennis shoes were  still in there.  I rest my case.  Yes.  I'm not making accusations.  I'm just, I ain't driving in the city.  That is when suburbia visits the city.  You go into this battle mode, where you can't totally enjoy what you're doing.  They're the trouble.  Yeah.  Guys in Long Island, Jersey, the suburb, they're the trouble guys.  They walk around the city, they just see a black guy like, nigga, if you try it, there's 
[03:31:00]  40 of us.  It's like, excuse me, I'm going to work.  Exactly.  What do you do?  Yeah, work over who?  No, you idiot.  How about this one?  You stop at Jamaica, and they make the announcement, don't change to Jamaica, that's for the white  boys, right?  Yeah.  But then they have to wait for another train, so they open the doors at Jamaica, and you're  like, oh, God, do they have to do that?  Oh, no, stop it.  Now you're just giving them a chance.  Now you're giving them a chance to come on.  And mug us. 
[03:31:30]  Great, now they can easily get away.  Great exchange, dicks.  And you just watch the open door, just waiting for it to close.  Just waiting to be robbed.  When you're from Long Island, this is the stuff that makes you paranoid.  You're like, oh, God, they're already telling us, don't get out at Jamaica, and now  they're opening the doors.  Oh, my God.  You start turning into that platform dude, like every two seconds, you're platform dudes  are the guys that get all the way, as close as they can.  They go over the yellow line, no fear.  Yeah.  And they're looking over, like, to see where the tracks are, but they're leaning over the  tracks, like, I do not fear falling in. 
[03:32:00]  You can't do that.  I do not fear it.  Where is this train?  I see the lights.  It's coming.  It's coming, everybody.  I do not.  The first dude that knows it's coming.  There's no reason that when I go down into the subway to get on the train, I stand back  from the line.  Because first of all, you don't know what the lunatic is going to push you.  It's going to push you.  He was talking to me.  I heard it out his head.  What?  Yeah.  I was just standing waiting for the...  Boom!  There you go.  He was the spaceship man. 
[03:32:30]  Bling, bling.  You can't have broccoli with two doors and some chili.  Now take the clouds and look out, you dummy, or I'll take that shirt of yours and I'll let  you know about the cars.  Now let's go.  It's America.  There's no way you'd stand by that line.  I never thought he would push them.  Yeah.  That's everyone's always surprised.  It's not like the guy in the suit is pushing people under the train.  I'm the guy that goes right against the wall where you can't even put a credit card between 
[03:33:00]  me and the wall.  Lean against the wall.  There's no reason.  We're like 50 feet up and if I take one inch of it, the railing, I get that feeling like  when you're hanging out, even when the train's coming, I could be right against the wall like  you, but I still feel there's some genetic force that's going to suck me at the last  second.  Like pull you and push you in front of the train.  Dude, I hate that, sir.  I hate that, sir.  And there's no one that could give me any valid reason for leaning over and looking for  the train.  When it gets there, it gets there.  Exactly.  Because we're all a bunch of impatient Fs. 
[03:33:30]  Well, you know, I...  Can't wait to get to my job to be miserable for eight hours today.  It's not even impatient.  Come home, drink, and punch my wife in the forehead.  Because if you look...  I look as long as I know there's no one...  Oh, her sister will try to bang her for the next week.  As long as I know there's no one within a hundred feet of me.  There's no reason to look.  Come on, dog.  Let's take a walk so I can get high.  Because you're going to see it.  You're going to see it, what, three to four seconds before it gets there?  I mean, there's no reason.  And like, that's going to make it go faster.  Yeah.  I think it's the...  It's not working today. 
[03:34:00]  It's coming.  It's coming.  Here it comes.  That guy.  You know, you've got to be the guy that...  I'm the leader.  Let me take a piece.  It's coming.  It's coming.  The train's coming.  I just saw it.  I leaned over.  I took the risk.  I heard it.  I heard it.  Oh, crap.  It's the other side.  Don't get in that one.  That goes to Lindbrook.  I changed to Long Beach.  Don't go in that one.  Dude, how about the puke train?  Coming back from the shows?  Coming back from the garden?  Those are always fun, yeah.  Guys are arguing about the Rangers and the Islanders.  I feel bad for the Long Island Railroad employees after the Ranger games, after the Nick games, 
[03:34:30]  and after, like, the Aussie concert or whatever at the garden.  Tickets, please.  Aussie!  Aussie!  Aussie!  Get off me, dick!  It just turns out to be the puke-slash-makeout train.  Whenever it goes to stop at a station, you just see this liquid going to the front of the train when it stops,  going to the back when they take off again.  Feet up!  Feet up!  It's a vomit time. 
[03:35:00]  Everyone has their concert tees, and they are just snotty.  Hammered.  Dude, I'm so glad they play girls, girls, girls.  I'm so glad they play that.  When they left, I didn't think they were going to do it.  I didn't think, but they came back.  And everyone goes home or goes to their car or whatever they're going to after they get off the train.  With the flat, my head's been against the window asleep hairdo.  Are you guys going to bed or are we going to get something to eat?  Let's go to the diner.  Let's go to the excited diner.  Come on!  Fries, gravy? 
[03:35:30]  What are we doing?  Come on!  Let's go see Akka!  Akka!  Akka!  Yeah, whatever his name is, man.  You know the Greek dude.  They're all Greek.  Mama Buki!  Mama Buki!  Is that what you're doing to work?  Got to get a little breakfast after the show.  Sure.  Some diner fun.  Never hurt anyone, right?  How do you say your mama likes the Buki in Greek?  Hurry up.  Here he comes.  Hey, what's up, Stravaros?  Stravaros! 
[03:36:00]  Stravaros!  The way I like it.  No mushrooms, Dick.  You snuck them in last week, you dickhead.  And there's nothing worse than being in a goddamn diner when there are just little gangs of people that are at the booths throwing crap at each other and just being loud and obnoxious.  I don't think Jerry got caught where I don't think he got on the... He might have been in Long Beach. Should we look for him?  Dude, you're supposed to make sure he got on the train.  Dick, if he's dead on the train, F him.  Let him wake up and want off. 
[03:36:30]  He'll get up in Port Jeff.  Port Jeff, yeah.  Where'd this conversation start?  All right, Tracy Morgan.  I was trying to figure that out, too.  Tracy, holy crap.  All right, let's take a break. We'll be back.  You can't exist here.  Program complete.  We'll be right back. </pre>
