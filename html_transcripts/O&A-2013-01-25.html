<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts discussing their confusion about the passage of time, quickly transitioning to a heated debate about SiriusXM’s aggressive removal of their show clips from YouTube and other online platforms.  They expressed outrage at this action, particularly since Steve Blatter, a SiriusXM executive, had allegedly assured them that the online presence was beneficial, attracting new listeners and subscribers. The hosts detailed the frustration of dealing with the slow, unresponsive nature of SiriusXM, using humorous comparisons to the inefficiency of the Star Wars Empire.

Following this, the conversation shifted to more lighthearted topics.  Opie voiced his disappointment with Starbucks' new "blonde" roast coffee,  contrasted with his profit from Apple's recent stock drop.  They speculated on Apple's struggles, attributing them to a lack of innovation and increased competition.  Opie then relayed a secondhand anecdote about Ashton Kutcher's reaction to finishing the Steve Jobs biopic, claiming Kutcher believed he could now run Apple.  A clip from the movie was played, with the hosts commenting on Kutcher's performance and comparing it to his own persona.  The discussion then briefly touched on the exorbitant cost of college textbooks. A listener called in, offering insights into Apple's potential failings based on a Steve Jobs biography, focusing on unrealized educational plans.

The show then focused heavily on Ashton Kutcher's portrayal of Steve Jobs, contrasting it with Jobs's actual personality. This transitioned into a lengthy discussion of Scorch and clips from his low-budget show "PFG TV," which were mocked extensively.  The hosts recounted stories about Scorch, including an incident involving paint being thrown at him. The conversation turned to Manti Te'o's highly publicized catfishing hoax, with the hosts playing and analyzing clips of his Katie Couric interview, expressing disbelief at his naiveté and comparing him to their gullible listener, Bobo.  They also briefly discussed a school shooting and related conspiracy theories, before mentioning other show regulars like Jim Chandler and Scott and Todd, and teasing upcoming segments.

A subsequent segment delved deeper into the Manti Te'o catfishing story, involving a female co-host, Katie.  The hosts dissected Ty's (Manti Te'o's) account, highlighting its inconsistencies and repeatedly calling him an idiot, moron, and dummy.  They offered a $25,000 reward, escalating to $1 million for video proof of Ty engaging in anal sex with a dildo, to prove he’d had sexual relations with anyone.  The hosts played and analyzed voicemails supposedly from Lene (Te’o’s fake girlfriend), debated their authenticity and discussed a picture from their college radio days. A caller, Pat, claimed to know Ty's supposed girlfriend, further fueling the discussion of the hoax’s intricacies.

The show then featured an in-studio interview with Vanilla Ice.  Alongside DJ Who Kid, they discussed Vanilla Ice's career transition to real estate, his TV show "The Vanilla Ice Project," his views on the housing market, his health regimen, his past legal battles over sampling "Under Pressure," and his continuing success with "Ice Ice Baby."  The conversation was punctuated by humorous banter and references to drugs. A caller, Kevin O'Neill, who attended the hosts' wedding, called in, prompting reminiscing about the event.  The conversation briefly returned to a previous segment involving Scorch.

The broadcast ended with an advertisement for Stephen Singer Jewelers, featuring "sky blue diamonds," interwoven with repeated use of "Ice Ice Baby."  This was followed by a nonsensical exchange about doing a line of a substance, repeated exclamations of "Later," and incoherent pronouncements, possibly from a guest or caller, mentioning "Beaikat," subways, and Boston.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  Antonio!  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Oh, look at that.  How'd that happen?  We're back already.  Wait a minute.  How did that all happen?  That's a very good question.  See, the last thing I remember from this show,  we were leaving, right?  And we said, have a nice day, we'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah, and then, like, it's tomorrow. 
[00:00:30]  How's that happen?  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  Can you turn down the fucking music?  Oh, E.  Why can't we figure out that volume?  I don't know.  We gotta do a little house, what do they call it?  Housework? Housecleaning?  Housecleaning?  What is it called?  Straightening up? What?  We were lied to yesterday, and...  Oh, boy.  I just want to go on a record and say that we were lied to yesterday.  A record?  We had a meeting after the show, 
[00:01:00]  and I don't give a flying fuck if I piss off anybody.  I'm gonna tell you exactly what was said in a meeting yesterday.  Yeah.  We did our who-gives-a-shit meeting that me and Ant do about once every two or three months.  Yeah.  It is really a who-gives-a-shit meeting.  We're holding up pretty much a lot of people.  We're carrying them on our fucking backs.  I was definitely yawning.  And then we gotta make believe...  Oh, I know.  And then we gotta make believe these people matter in our lives, in our careers.  It's really a ridiculous thing that we've dealt with for many, many years. 
[00:01:30]  We are quite charitable going into these meetings like we really care.  No, it's not...  You know, it's a nice little conversation.  Sure.  And everyone plays their part.  We make believe the person we're talking to could actually do things for us.  Right.  And then we kind of give them a little like, oh, okay, that's so good.  All right.  Yeah.  And then we go home and forget that we ever had the meeting.  It's been our thing for, fuck, 18 and a half years, probably.  So yesterday in this meeting, it was brought to my attention that the SiriusXM lawyers had 
[00:02:00]  a clip removed from YouTube.  Somebody was a little upset with the clip, I guess.  Didn't like the content.  We don't get involved with that shit whatsoever.  And I want to make that perfectly clear.  So I guess, I guess a special, I don't, it wasn't even a special interest group.  Some, somebody complained about an old bit we did that...  Two-year-old clip.  Was it two years old? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  And it wasn't even a bit.  It was just some part of a conversation.  Yeah.  And what was it about?  We were making fun of cerebral palsy, was it?  Somebody that was in the studio that day.  Yeah.  I don't even know who it was.  I swear to God, I don't even know who was making fun of cerebral palsy.  I don't know in what way, because, you know, I think, I think anything  could be made fun of.  Yeah, we've done that before.  We've said that many, many times over the years.  So I guess a parent was listening and was like, ah!  Right.  And, all right, sure, that's a little too close for them.  And I could understand why they would be mad. 
[00:03:00]  But, I mean, we've said it, and it has to be said again.  A lot of shit we talk about and make fun of affects us personally.  Yeah.  It really does.  I make fun of mental illness.  I mean, mental illness has been a nightmare in my family since I could remember.  But I have no problem fucking making fun of it.  I have no problem if others make fun of it.  I have no problem if people make fun of my mom.  All that shit.  And there's a lot more examples, but I'll just use that one today.  So this clip, you know, bummed out somebody out there.  So they brought it to the attention of SiriusXM.  So, of course, the lawyers had to get involved. 
[00:03:30]  And they decided they needed to get rid of this clip immediately.  So in this meeting yesterday with Steve Blatter, Steve told us this was going on.  I'm like, oh, okay.  What are we going to do?  But, you know, they decided that they want the clip removed.  And I'm thinking if it's one clip, whatever, you know, we're not going to we're not going to win all battles.  And Steve goes, but that's the only clip they're removing from YouTube.  I'm like, oh, okay.  Because we are very aware that our material is out there on YouTube.  It's out on Reddit. 
[00:04:00]  It's all over the place.  It's it's in places that I know of that I won't even mention here because that'll just get the lawyers fucking going in.  Yes.  And I and and the reason we never get involved with that shit is because it's spreading the word of the show.  It's spreading ONA.  And a lot of people, they get turned on to the show by hearing a clip on YouTube or somewhere else.  And in a lot of cases, they turn around and go, fuck, I'm going to buy the service.  Yeah, I know it works that way.  I hear from the people.  So we were lied to yesterday because we were we were we were told about the situation with this one clip that was a little touchy and they just decided to get rid of it on YouTube. 
[00:04:30]  All right.  What are you going to do?  Fuck, because I know of all the other shit that's going on.  And I wake up this morning to people from all over the world, the world, literally all over the planet Earth, because there's I don't know.  The listeners get together in all these places.  They get together in places I don't even know about.  But it made some kind of message board basically saying that the lawyers are aggressively taking down everything. 
[00:05:00]  Sending out fucking cease and desist.  And right.  Subpoenas things.  One guy saying he got a subpoena.  A subpoena.  This goes completely against what was said to us in this meeting yesterday.  So what the fuck?  Yeah.  My question is Steve Blatter.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  What happened?  Because then I wrote I write him.  He goes, I'm unaware of this.  Well, why are you unaware of this?  You told us that they were getting rid of one clip.  Yeah.  He writes.  That's news to me.  The only clip I'm aware of is the one we talked about earlier today, which we just mentioned 
[00:05:30]  here.  Yeah.  We'll look into this further.  We'll look into this further.  Shouldn't you be on top of this?  This was as far as when we left the meeting yesterday.  It was just that clip and everything.  And it wasn't even like, you know, yeah, I think they're OK.  He was like, no, no.  The rest of it.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They won't.  They won't.  It's just this one clip.  And then it's everything.  Right.  And I was getting tweets yesterday from people that were like mad at me. 
[00:06:00]  Like, oh, you take down the clips.  You get the lawyers after us.  I'm like, and I just put I did.  I can't.  I used to spend way too much trying to explain myself in the show to people and they just  don't.  They just.  Yeah, exactly.  They just don't want to hear it.  No, they don't.  We have nothing to do with this.  Why would we want that?  Right.  Right.  I don't give a fuck how many people listen to us through Sirius XM.  I do give a fuck how many people are listening to us in general.  And if that means they're listening in other ways, that's so good for us. 
[00:06:30]  So good for the Opie and Anthony brand.  And so why would we be the ones that would fucking attack fans that are trying to spread the word  of the show?  We started a syndicate a syndication on the ground years ago, years ago, way before any  of this technology was available to us.  We encourage people to tape the show and get it out there for us.  Yeah.  So, of course, we we continue down that road to this day.  And if there's no satellite available all over the world, which there isn't, you know,  people in Australia being able to listen.  Right. 
[00:07:00]  That's pretty cool.  Here's a guy.  He goes, yep.  Another fan who's pissed about the YouTube video thing being taken down.  The only way to get new stuff in the UK.  Like what this is affecting and it's not going to matter to these idiots, you know,  that we currently work for.  We'll have it.  We'll work for a bunch of other idiots.  Trust me.  They're just the current idiots.  It's affecting people that like the show from around the world and they don't have the  technology to cater to those people.  Like you said, just before the show, our friends get to podcast to the world. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  We get to do our show to America.  That's it.  Like the world is open to these people now.  Yeah.  That want to like do a podcast or videos or whatnot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And get it like on demand and shit like that.  So you can listen.  You know, these are the ones that came in before we even brought it up on the show.  So here's a guy from Belgium, bummed out, huge fan, but the only way I can listen is  through the YouTube clips. 
[00:08:00]  Let's see, a guy from Australia.  I'm just quickly going through my feed.  Another guy from England, a guy from Ireland, and it goes on.  Another Australian guy.  Yeah, because we're always wondering why the fuck do we have a fan base in Australia?  That always confused me, but it's because they go on YouTube, they find some of the cool  clips, and that's how they're becoming fans.  Yep.  My point here today is that we were lied to.  Yeah, that's the biggest thing.  Well, Steve will say that he didn't lie to us. 
[00:08:30]  Of course.  But why aren't you aware?  He'll just point to the ceiling.  That's those people, you know.  Those guys.  Up there.  What are you going to do?  The faceless, nameless entity that controls things.  Just chip away at the greatness of this fucking thing.  Yes.  Chip away.  Chip away.  Chip away.  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  It makes it harder and harder to do this when you've got your own people working against  you.  Because I know it's turning people onto subscriptions. 
[00:09:00]  Yes.  And then you've got the people that just don't have a way to get a subscription that they're  becoming fans because they get to listen to the clips.  Oh, good gravy.  I don't want no meeting today, though.  That's for sure.  I'm having a little...  Oh, interesting.  People are stupid.  Well, in the end, I mean, you know. 
[00:09:30]  Yes.  It's it.  It's it.  It's it.  I do want to say something, but I better not.  Yeah.  I want to say something.  No, I want to give a rah-rah speech to the fucking fans, but I bet.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We probably.  Let's just put it this way.  I think they get it.  You can't be stopped.  You can't be stopped.  I'll say.  Yeah, but it's becoming a thing. 
[00:10:00]  It's certainly a thing.  A thing.  I know a lot of people on Reddit and a lot of people just contacting me personally on  Twitter right now.  I mean, a lot.  Wow.  Wow.  I can't even keep up on my feed right now.  A lot of UK's coming in.  A lot of UK people.  So gay.  UK.  Oh, I get it.  But point being, that's exactly what we were told in the meeting.  We have nothing to do with this.  We absolutely would not encourage the lawyers to take our material off, you know, a little 
[00:10:30]  site called YouTube.  Why would we do that?  Exactly.  Are you kidding me?  But apparently people thought we were last night from some of the tweetsies I was getting.  And I already know what tweet is going to be said to us.  Well, I guess, you know, they, they, uh, they, they told me and then they did that.  And I, uh, you know, and then when any of this shit isn't in front of a lawyer, you know, 
[00:11:00]  good luck.  Anything that goes in front of the lawyer turns into shit and unfunny and no reason for it.  And just, it just lawyers stink.  And then, uh, that we're not even in on it.  No.  Because I would explain myself to some of these people how it does work and how, how it is  good marketing and how it does lead to subscriptions.  Oh, they wouldn't hear that.  Of course not.  No, no.  They just hear, uh, oh, get it off.  Huh?  They just hear, get it off.  Take it off.  Right. 
[00:11:30]  So.  Bastards.  I felt like we needed to address that because, uh, you know, if you get one or two tweets,  it's one thing, but I mean, this is becoming a really big deal, really big deal.  Yeah.  And a lot of people, which I would show these guys, uh, the tweets basically saying, yeah,  I'll be honest.  I was listening to your show, you know, here or there, but then it led me to actually subscribing.  Ah.  And it's a lot of people that, you know, we, uh, after all these years, we're maybe 
[00:12:00]  getting, uh, maybe getting some name recognition, maybe, you know, but a lot of people, they're  not just getting on the fucking store listening to Opie and Anthony.  They don't know anything about us.  Yeah.  So then they find a clip here and there and they go, wow, that Opie and Anthony keeps  popping up.  Oh, wow.  Oh, they're on Sirius.  They're on XM.  Okay, cool.  Yeah.  We don't have that household name.  We never did.  You know, when the company hires a dumb Martha Stewart, they're going for the household name with  no content.  Right.  Right.  We have the content with no, no name recognition. 
[00:12:30]  That's been our problem over the years.  And I think after all these years, we're up to what?  Eight now.  We're sort of getting, uh, some name recognition.  Yeah.  You got to put it out there.  Yeah.  But not even a lot, not a lot.  Not like these big stars that they hire just to do shows because they have a name.  So.  And they do no radio.  Huh?  And they do no radio themselves.  And they stink when they do that once a year show.  And yeah.  Yeah.  We're in here on a daily basis.  You know what's funny?  Now a bunch of people on Twitter are like, please don't mention me. 
[00:13:00]  Please don't mention my site.  Please don't.  I'm not going to.  Turn them in.  I'm not going to.  We're going to turn you in.  I'm more aware than you, you guys realize when it comes to this stuff.  So don't worry about it.  It's, but we had to mention this YouTube thing because they're, if I'm to believe, and I have  to believe because there's too many tweets coming in, they're aggressively going after  fans that are posting shit.  Yeah.  Jesus.  A way to not get anything. 
[00:13:30]  Well.  I just don't like either being lied to or having a meeting with, you know, people that can't  do anything for us.  He's going to say he wasn't lying.  He's going to say he didn't know that this was happening.  And he's looking into it.  The looking into it.  Looking into it.  By the way, how come looking into it here takes longer than anything else in the world?  I don't know.  It takes so long for them to look into things here. 
[00:14:00]  I don't know.  I mean, and, you know, the place lost a lot of talent because they just couldn't wait around  for the looking into it thing anymore.  Looking into it thing.  So they went, well, I'm going to look into getting another gig.  And they have.  Yes.  So you see these people that are slow, they slowly leave.  Uh-huh.  But then if all of a sudden all the people appeared that were creative, that left since  we've been in this building, we wouldn't have enough room in this studio.  That would be amazing. 
[00:14:30]  You know, so I was like, oh, he left.  Oh, he left.  Oh, they left.  Right.  A lot of talented people.  Because the other thing is they told us they're going to, you know, move this wall.  Remove this wall and give us a little more space.  But they got to look into things.  What did he say yesterday?  Looking into it.  Well, a week to maybe two weeks.  I'll have another.  Just looking into it.  Yeah, I'll have another update for you.  When Scott Greenstein himself walked down here and I go, this is what we want to do.  And I showed him.  Yeah.  And then he was honest. 
[00:15:00]  He's like, well, I don't know if I can give you all the space.  But I could give you.  I go, well, how about up to here?  Right.  This is all visual.  And I go, I did my hand.  Like, if you gave us up to here, that would make a huge difference.  He goes, all right, let's do this.  And then I think Gary was there, another useless one.  And he told Gary, you know, look into it immediately.  But now at the meeting yesterday, it's going to be another two weeks of looking into it.  And then maybe I'll have an update for you.  You know, it's like, because, of course, Star Wars being in the news.  Because it's like our guys are just the stormtroopers. 
[00:15:30]  They don't do anything as far as things like the Death Star is concerned and whatnot.  They're just stormtroopers.  So we talked to them and they just, we're looking into it.  We're looking into it.  Yeah.  But we could go down the hall to Darth Vader.  Right.  But the threat there is that we might get force choked.  Of course.  At some point.  Of course.  He'll get things done for us.  Because he's not just a fucking stormtrooper.  But we might get force choked.  Of course.  And that isn't pleasant. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Thank you.  I kind of like that.  Here's a guy, another guy's scared.  He just writes, there's no way to subscribe to SiriusXM in Australia.  We've got fans all over the world.  I know.  And I thank the fans for doing that because they were the ones that pushed out our material.  I thank you guys because we had no way to reach fucking Australia.  They took everything off of you, team.  What happened to you, team?  Yay, yo, yo.  I, nigh.  Yay, tape. 
[00:16:30]  And then you got the Sweden.  Ah.  You got the Sweden check.  Ah.  Big fan listening from Sweden.  Well, how?  You still listen all the time.  Where's the shoes?  I guess someone has just, you know, called Sweden and just put their phone to the fucking radio.  That's why he knows we're talking right now.  Mer, mer, mer.  Sweden.  Hi, Sweden.  Sweden.  They're going to knock on your door and arrest you for listening to this illegally. 
[00:17:00]  Fucking hell.  See, I would, I would, it was a pleasant meeting yesterday.  Oh, sure.  You don't have, I would do that weekly.  I'd call it cordial.  It was cordial.  It was nice.  It was cordial.  He gave me some tips on my, uh, my dry winter skin.  Yes.  That a lot of people are suffering.  I enjoyed that, uh, part of the, the meeting.  You did?  Dry winter skin, uh, portion, uh, and the fact that, um, he doesn't like cortisone 10, that  it actually makes things worse.  Holy mother of Christ. 
[00:17:30]  Was I looking at my fucking, the time on my phone at that point?  And I was itching and itching.  He goes, you know, itching is the worst thing you could do.  I'm like, Oh really?  Well, how about, how about try not itching?  How about you try not itching?  That was my favorite part of the meeting.  You know, when you itch it, it makes it worse.  Yeah.  I think we all know if you itch something in general, it makes it worse, but it feels  so goddamn good.  It's been the bane of human existence for years. 
[00:18:00]  I will, I will itch athlete's foot right off my fucking toes.  That shit makes you itch.  Where I can't even walk anymore, but you know what?  When I itch that fucking athlete's foot right off my body, it's the best feeling ever.  It feels, when you itch, man, it just feels great.  It feels great.  If it didn't feel good, why would you stand against a door jam like a bear on a tree?  I'm trying to fucking scratch your back.  Amazing.  I would have, I would, and I'm not even kidding.  I would have one of those meetings once a week because they're, they're kind of quick. 
[00:18:30]  If I knew it was actually accomplishing something.  Yeah.  The slowdown in this place.  Well, things got accomplished yesterday.  We, we've got lied to.  That was good.  That was a call.  I would really like to know the answer to that one because, you know, wow.  I mean, there's one thing you get a little nervous about a clip and I don't even, I don't  even live in that world.  I'm like, I can explain any clip we've done over the years.  You certainly can as well.  Yeah.  So I don't even understand that.  But we, we, we do understand in this business, you got to give and take a little. 
[00:19:00]  So every once in a while you have to give up on some little dumb thing.  It's choosing your battles.  Everybody does it no matter what job they're in.  But to tell us that this one clip was being removed because it made some people a little  nervous.  That's, that's one thing.  And now finding out, you know, a mere 12 hours later or whatever it is, that avalanche  of, that actually there's an aggressive assault going on.  Yeah.  Like legal letters.  Going after our fans.  What the fuck?  You put us in a weird position.  Yeah.  So I figured, you know, we're trying to bitch less, but you know, this is something I think 
[00:19:30]  it was important to bring up.  Yeah.  Especially since people, you know, think we had something to do with it.  Yeah.  I saw your tweet.  I did.  Yeah, I did.  Really?  Wow.  I got to check that out.  I can't, I can't like, I can't battle those people anymore.  I didn't do nothing, man.  Oh, hi, Sam.  Sam, do you have a charger for the new iPhone?  I do not.  What?  At home? 
[00:20:00]  Go home.  Jesus Christ.  You're going to have to buy another fucking charger?  Another one?  I'm at 20% power and you know on iPhone 5.  Someone around here has got to have a charger?  20% power on an Apple 5?  Doesn't work very long.  You know, but it does have a nice Apple on the back.  Apple, everyone was talking about Apple and of course you made your quick hit yesterday.  I fucking capitalized a bit.  Yes.  Wait, I'm going to do something right now. 
[00:20:30]  Hold on.  And then we're going to get into Apple.  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, what's wrong?  Well, I got, I got rooked in because, you know, I used to be a huge Starbucks  fan.  Certainly.  Huge.  Like when Starbucks first hit and it was either horrible deli coffee or you could go  to Starbucks.  Starbucks was amazing.  That was, yeah, I remember those days.  Starbucks coffee, and I don't give a fuck if they were thinking of advertising with  us, is so overrated at this point. 
[00:21:00]  Is it?  Yes.  You didn't just get used to it?  You think that's possible?  I don't know.  Like, and then something different is kind of like, oh, that's nice.  I don't know, because I search out any other coffee joint in my neighborhood besides Starbucks.  There's others that pop up, little mom and pops, and then of course Starbucks fucking  hammers them and basically puts a Starbucks on top of them.  Mob tactics.  Oh my God.  They just come and beat the guy.  Right.  Well, you let the little guys fucking have a shot because I kind of like the little guys  in their coffee.  They really do. 
[00:21:30]  And I get Starbucks every morning because it's close to here, whatever.  But they've been advertising, what is it called?  Blonde?  Mr. Blonde.  For the people that might like a lighter roast.  Oh.  You know, we watch you too, so we've made a lighter roast because we know some of you  people don't like our heavy, dark roast fucking coffee.  So I saw the commercials yesterday.  They're pounding them into your head.  I don't know if you've seen this because you're not a coffee drinker.  So you probably don't pay attention.  Nah.  So I told Chris, I'm like, hey man, I want to try that blonde shit today. 
[00:22:00]  I just tried it.  It's coffee.  There's nothing different about it.  Is it?  Yes.  I bet the price is different.  And I put a little milk in it.  I didn't jazz it up with anything just so I could get a basic comparison.  It's not worth it.  When I was drinking coffee back in, I call it the day.  Yeah.  I would get like half a cup.  I'd pour half a milk in or heavy like cream and then load the shit out of it with sugar  and just drink that fucking shit down. 
[00:22:30]  You've never liked coffee?  Not really.  I like espresso with a little Sambuca in it.  Sure.  Marron.  What do you mean a little?  Well, yeah.  Well, because I'm usually drinking also because it's dinner.  So I have like some wine.  You have espresso and coffee mugs to, you know, handle the Sambuca.  I have a fucking bottle of Sambuca I throw in there.  It's Guinea mouthwash.  Sambuca.  But I'm here to say I just tried the blonde, I think it's called.  Yeah.  It's nothing special. 
[00:23:00]  Sorry, Starbucks.  Man.  Please don't sue me.  I bet you were all excited, too.  No, I wasn't even excited.  I figured I'd...  Oh.  Like...  Ooh.  I had low expectations.  I figured it was just some dumb advertising gimmick.  Like management here.  You just have low expectations.  You hope for the best, but expect the worst.  Unless they didn't have the blonde at Starbucks and I just fucking blew up their spot.  Oh, maybe.  So now I got to make sure they did get the blonde for me to try.  Anyway, Apple. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  And Apple.  Boy, they took quite a hit yesterday.  A lot of people have Apple.  They did.  And they sold a fucking record number of phones and shit.  They had a great quarter, right?  Well, it was okay.  They made a fuckload of money.  Right.  But their future projections are not as good as in the past.  Of course.  You know, they're used to...  Everyone else is catching up.  Right.  They used to these giant fucking quarters that they've been having.  Record setting.  And now they got this, you know, like your phone, the Samsung.  I love my S3.  And I've been an iPhone and Apple fucking fanboy for quite a while. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  And I was looking at that phone going, fuck, man.  That's a good goddamn phone.  And everybody else, for years, that was coming up going, this is the iPhone killer, I would  laugh and go, stop it.  Well, you would laugh at me.  I went through three or four of these.  You went through quite a few phones.  And I would go about my business hoping someone would notice my phone.  You kind of like when someone notices your phone, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And never.  Never notice.  But this thing, man, wherever I go, people will go, I'll get one a day. 
[00:24:30]  Where someone will go, you like that phone?  I'm like, yeah, man.  I love it.  And those are, by the way, those are iPhone people going, hey, you like that phone?  A lot of iPhone people.  Yeah.  You start looking at it.  And then people go, well, it's too big.  It's big, but it's not too big.  It fits everywhere the iPhone fits.  And it's got a bigger fucking screen, which rules as far as video goes.  Honestly, I got an iPhone in my house as well.  And when I have to use that quickly, like my son will play games or whatever.  So like a little postage stamp in your hand?  It feels too, yeah, the screen feels too small now. 
[00:25:00]  Like this screen is not that much bigger than the iPhone, but it just seems to.  Big enough.  It's big enough, man.  It's big enough for me.  Big enough.  A gay AIDS.  But here's the deal with Apple.  They realize that, you know, they got the competition now.  They're not the only game in town.  And that's what the investors are seeing.  And even though they had a really good quarter, people are like, ah, yeah, but, you know.  Doesn't look rosy for the next quarter.  Or, yeah, down the road.  Because they said they have, I think, one point, was it $1.3 billion in cash? 
[00:25:30]  They have huge billions of dollars, right?  How much is it?  Is it that?  I thought it was more, to tell you the truth, but.  No, it has to be more than 1.3, right?  Yeah.  What's the number they said yesterday?  How much money does Apple have tucked away in their fucking. . .  Their cash, they said.  Their account.  Which is unbelievable for any company.  Is it 1.3, or I'm way off, right?  No, it's $137 billion.  Yeah.  Billion.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They have. . . 
[00:26:00]  $137 billion cash.  That means they got this money that they don't even fucking know what to do with.  They've got profits more than, like, Exxon.  Right.  Just ridiculous amounts of money.  You see those Microsoft stores popping up now?  Yeah.  That look exactly like the Apple store.  They have the people with the little tags and their names.  Can't you. . . .  No, they can't.  See, people have always been influenced, but then the thing to do is . . .  And every person has been influenced. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  Everyone.  That's why I laugh at Howard Stern and his stupid shit, because even he has been influenced.  Influenced.  But he doesn't want anyone to be influenced by him.  The thing to do, and they've done it in movies and music and in arts in general and smartphones,  you're influenced, and then you make it your own.  Uh-huh.  So when, like, Microsoft opens up a store that looks just like an Apple store, that's fucking ridiculous.  Yeah.  You couldn't change it a little bit to make it your own thing? 
[00:27:00]  It's very stark and bright.  Right.  And you walk in, it's like, hey, I'm in the Apple store, only, like, there's not a lot of people in here.  Yeah, you get tricked into thinking you're in an Apple store, but you see these things that look completely foreign.  I hear their little tablet slash computer thing is getting a lot of people going, like, ooh, what's this?  Really?  Ooh, yeah, what's that thing called?  Surface.  Surface.  And then people are like, but it's heavy, and it's this, and that.  Because it's not just a tablet.  The thing is literally a fucking computer. 
[00:27:30]  Is that like a laptop?  Yeah, it's kind of, no, it's like a tablet, but it's got that cover keyboard thing.  Yeah, so it looks like a laptop.  Yeah, but that's just like the cover, but it's got keyboard on it.  But they don't want to say laptop, because that's integrated.  Right, right.  That's a laptop.  They're redesigning the laptop, but they don't want to call it the laptop.  Yep.  Right?  Don't you think?  Pretty much.  And then they got the touchscreen on it and shit.  But, like, people are starting to look into the Surface going, eh, this looks pretty cool. 
[00:28:00]  Because, you know, you've got USB interface and fucking, yeah, it's a computer.  It's a fucking computer.  You can run a game on that goddamn thing.  Right.  So Apple is definitely getting some competition from other places.  And boy, did it show yesterday with that fucking stock.  Oh, did that take a shit.  What did it go down yesterday?  It took like a $60 hit.  Wow.  A $60 hit.  What was the high?  Seven something a couple months ago?  Yes, seven and change.  Seven 14, I think, maybe I saw. 
[00:28:30]  And now it's down to $450.  $450.  Unbelievable.  I mean, it'll go up a little bit.  I think.  Because that seems a little too low.  It might be a buying opportunity, but I don't know that world.  We'll get the dead cat bounce, they call it today.  But it's not going to go back up into the 700s anytime soon.  They're going to have to do something pretty amazing for it to get back up there.  You think Tim Cook is feeling a little pressure?  Oh, boy.  Everyone's looking at him like, all right, fucking smartass.  Where's your new fucking technology thing? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Steve Jobs just had a way of fucking making things seem really new and exciting.  And now it's just, oh, and it's the iPhone 8.  Right.  The iPhone 13.  The iPhone 22.  Everybody.  Woo.  And then it's like, what is it?  Well, the volume buttons are square.  Square volume buttons.  What?  I need that.  The only thing they could do is make things, well, this time we're going to make it a little 
[00:29:30]  bigger.  A little bigger?  Fast forward three months.  This time we're going to make it a little smaller.  We need it a little smaller.  We've listened to you and we understand you are looking for something a little smaller.  Right.  Guess what?  Now we're going to make it a little bigger.  A little wider.  That's what we're going to be doing.  Let's introduce the new iPhone 352.  They need a new gadget.  They need a new gadget. 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  New gadget.  So that happened yesterday.  I cashed out on that motherfucker.  Yeah.  Nice little day, right?  Oh, finally.  I was waiting.  I was just sitting on nothing for a while.  I hadn't been trading anything because it's just been crazy one way or the other.  Can't figure it out.  There's a problem with them putting out a new gadget.  Yeah.  That's why it'll never be back up is that they would have to take over another industry.  Yes.  Like they took over the music industry and then the phone industry. 
[00:30:30]  What are the odds?  Are they going to be able to take over televisions?  Well, there was some talk about Apple TV, not the Apple TV that they have now, but actual  television sets.  Well, they're going to have to look at what emerging technology is happening in some market  and scoop it up and get in there.  That's what they did with the smartphone.  No one called these things smartphones before the iPhone.  It was just a fucking phone.  And then it started doing a bunch of shit.  But one guy's phone did something.  The other guy's phone did something else. 
[00:31:00]  This guy.  And they figured out how to kind of put it all in one package, get a really decent camera  in there.  The touch screen thing made it so much more convenient than buttons.  I mean, they really did change the face of fucking clothes.  Of course they did.  But then, all right, now what?  And you get like Samsung goes, yeah, Apple, what a great idea.  Now we're going to do this.  Right.  But Obi was also right about just Steve Jobs being there, made it seem like you had to  have, because the first iPhone was not as good as a BlackBerry.  The email wasn't great. 
[00:31:30]  Do you even remember?  If you remember, there were a lot.  Do you remember what it looks like anymore?  It was very buggy.  Yeah.  It was curved back.  Maybe not.  Maybe not.  It was curved, kind of.  Yeah.  It was very curvy.  The back wasn't flat.  How weird is we barely remember this?  And it's only, what, five years ago, maybe?  Right.  But Steve Jobs convinced you that this was like, you had to have it.  Right.  Even though it wasn't where it had to be.  Oh, the second I saw it, I was like, I need it.  Yeah.  I've been studying the cell phones for a while now, because I've got a guy in my neighborhood  that's cool, and I go in there a lot and stuff.  And I remember, like, it was just, you know, the phones were just getting smaller and smaller. 
[00:32:00]  Yes.  And he showed me something that was like, I'm not even joking.  It was maybe like two of my thumbs.  He goes, yep, this is where the phones are going.  That's it.  And I'm like, wow, that's kind of cool.  I never got it or whatever, and I forgot what brand it was.  And then all of a sudden, like, all these big phones were in front of him.  I'm like, what the fuck's going on?  I was like, oh, now we're going big again, man.  It's all about big.  When they became internet capable and playing videos, you needed the screen.  Right.  You needed a bigger fucking phone, so. 
[00:32:30]  But they drastically changed.  Yeah.  And then all these phones that were on display, like, oh, no, you need these, were like in the  case, kind of in the back.  They're like, oh, whoops.  Yeah, yeah.  Whoops.  See, that was an error.  Yeah.  So they need to find some kind of new technology, but something that isn't out of the, you know,  not food or something that isn't out of their wheelhouse.  I think they were just in a rare place, Apple.  Yeah.  And I think, as you say, they need a new gadget or a new technology. 
[00:33:00]  It's not going to happen like it did, because now everybody has caught up.  They're not going to be the, they could be the leader still, certainly, but they're not  going to have the lead they had for so many years.  But with something new, they might.  They got all that cash for R&D.  I mean, they got so much fucking money to look into something, something we're not even  thinking about now.  Yeah.  Like some new emerging technology, maybe for the automobile industry or something, like  I think the odds are it's going to be somebody else. 
[00:33:30]  It might be.  You're right.  I think Steve Jobs also had a lot to do with really pushing his guys and finding the right  talent in there and stuff.  I think the MiFi is going to make a huge comeback.  Oh, really?  So?  Oh, my God.  I was at the fucking press conference on MiFi.  It was amazing.  Remember when they pulled that out?  The MiFi.  Remember?  If someone that had horrendous bad breath and decided not to cut his hair? 
[00:34:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm like, oh, great.  This is who we're counting on.  They were promoting this MiFi.  We went.  You were there, right?  Yes.  And there was a big unveiling and the press all looked at each other like, what the fuck?  Because there's more things for people to hold on.  It was a half a brick.  Iraq, comment?  On Monday's worst of, we replayed when you were at the World Poker Tour in 2005 because  it was Joe Rogan's first show.  And you guys were talking about how great it was to be out in Los Angeles and walk around  and drive around with your new MiFi's.  You could hear the replay and all the music that XM had to offer. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, boy.  We were good little soldiers.  It was a big commercial.  No, you know what?  It was cool for the time, but I think what my point is, a lot of people were expecting  it to be a lot smaller than it was.  I mean, the technology itself was cool because finally, I mean, a lot of people forget when  we first went to satellite, you couldn't just leave your car and continue to listen to the  show.  We take that for granted now.  If you remember also, though, it came out about the same time the fucking iPod came out 
[00:35:00]  and the iPod made that look fucking silly.  Here's this giant fucking, it looked like the old transistor radio's grandpa would hold  to his head listening to the Mets.  And you got a fucking credit card thin iPod that you're playing music off.  You sure?  The iPods were down to that size.  Maybe not that size.  It was definitely a lot smaller than the MiFi.  So much smaller.  You're right.  You could, they were, one of the selling points was that you could put, you know, MP3s on  the MiFi.  Oh, wow.  I bet they were huge storage. 
[00:35:30]  Johnny Utah says, Johnny Utah from Atlanta?  That's crazy.  Johnny Atlanta's from Maine.  I don't feel like taking a phone call.  He says, the Steve Jobs book explains why Apple will fail.  Maybe we should take it.  Yeah?  Because not, fuck it, it means we don't have to read a book.  All right.  I like the sound of that.  All right.  In as few words as possible there, Johnny Utah from Atlanta, why will Apple fail according  to the Steve Jobs book?  Good morning.  Because he was going to move the iPad technology into education. 
[00:36:00]  And that was going, that would just, that would have Apple locked into it.  He was, that was his next plan.  Really?  Shame.  Yeah.  The book is fascinating.  Anthony, you'd love it, man.  I would.  A book?  I'd love it.  I'd love a book.  You know, sir, I'm the reader on the show.  Really?  I read more books than these guys.  I'm the watcher.  You're the explorer, Opie.  I love it.  I read.  I love movies.  Maybe it doesn't sound like it at times, but I'm a good reader. 
[00:36:30]  Now, when you say move it into education, did you mean having, like, iPads in the schools?  So instead of kids having to buy these textbooks and shit, they would just download the books  they need for the semester and things like that?  Yeah, but also pre-college education, the interactive educational tool that people would have to buy into.  Oh, come on, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, really, man.  We're trying to have a real conversation right now.  He's a reader. 
[00:37:00]  What the hell?  I just get fucking intimidated by readers.  I'm sure you do.  No, really, though, because, and also his oversight, he was going to push it in that direction,  and he's the guy who has the connections and who could convince people to do it and to buy into it.  And I wonder if he's the ability to do it.  It seems like it would be a huge market.  Now, I've been out of college, what, pushing about 15 years now?  Why?  So I don't know what's going on in college or high schools or grammar schools. 
[00:37:30]  But to me, logically, it would make sense to give every kid, or the money you spend on the textbook,  so maybe you don't even have to give the kid, but the parents would see it as a better way,  where you give your kid an iPad, and then it would be just dumb apps to download the textbooks right into your iPad.  That seems to me like it would be a huge business for schools.  Right.  Yep.  It would also change the curriculum.  But, Anthony, you'd be interested in this.  There's a reason why iPads would get stolen by certain people. 
[00:38:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, they think that might increase the theft.  Because, you know, the people that would normally steal an iPad, they're not going to steal what you call books.  Right.  Right.  Hey, he's a buddy of mine.  You know what I mean?  Because, I mean, the amount of money I spent on textbooks, and I don't know, everyone knows it was such a scam.  You bought these books brand new for whatever.  I don't even remember the prices anymore.  It was a fucking ridiculous amount of money, right?  Yeah, and then you'd go back to the bookstore after the semester to try to get some of your money back, and they would give you, like, pennies on the dollar for the same book that looked pretty much brand new stuff. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  Yeah, you can't do that.  Like, the only way to get any money back is you have to go online and sell them back now.  Right.  But, yeah, if you went to the bookstore.  We didn't have online back then.  We had no choice.  15 years ago?  15 years ago?  There wasn't a...  Well, all right, 16.  All right, 17.  All right, 17 years ago.  All right, I patted it down a little bit.  It's okay.  I wouldn't mind if that technology happened, because I'd have a business, too.  I'd drive around, right, and I'd go to all the old places where they store the books and just have big book burnings right out there in the street. 
[00:39:00]  I think I could handle that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were making so much money in Geneseo.  Oh, my God.  They had a huge barn where you just walked in, and you just gave up your brand new books.  And then they...  Oh, we could give you $1.50 for this.  I'm like, $1.50.  Oh, gee, thanks.  I don't remember the prices, though, but it was certainly like...  Just because I read it doesn't mean anything was taken out of it.  It's still the same fucking book.  And then they would put it on their shelves, and then they would jack the price to almost like it was a brand new book. 
[00:39:30]  Was it Pawn Stars?  It was an amazing business for these small colleges.  Johnny, you know what?  Oh, he's gone.  I think I might do it for Johnny.  I might have to read the Steve Jobs book.  It doesn't get wordy, does it, with Chip talking and all that crap?  It's really long.  And there's a lot of detail.  Well, growing up, his father was...  Enough of the growing up crap.  Yeah.  What about the Ashton Kutcher movie?  Yeah.  I'll wait for that.  There's a clip from it. 
[00:40:00]  Is there?  Let's see.  I want to see.  I want to see.  By the way.  By the way.  I like updating our info.  This guy in New Orleans says, in my daughter's school, everyone has an iPad.  Ooh, really?  Must be a nice white school.  I bet it's a very high-income area.  That makes sense.  You give a kid an iPad, and you download the fucking textbooks as little apps.  Dollar here, two dollars a year, and they're still ahead of the game, I would assume.  The book publishers would probably try to cost the apps at like $65 for the app. 
[00:40:30]  Of course.  To try to recoup their money.  Of course.  And that's why there's going to be a problem.  Yeah.  That's why we'll never...  We just...  It takes forever to advance technology, because everyone has to get their fucking little fingers  involved.  Yeah.  Nobody wants to admit when their business is just void.  Antiquated.  Yeah.  Let's use the word again.  It's finished.  Yeah.  No one should have to buy an actual textbook anymore.  No.  Those days are gone.  But Sam's right.  That's a business for them, so they're going to fight tooth and nail, even though this new  technology would be great for everybody. 
[00:41:00]  You know how long the covered wagon was still around after fucking cars are going...  Yeah.  They were down the street, and the guy's still like, yeah!  Right.  Yeah, because they refuse to fucking let their business die.  Dummies.  Take your wooden wheels and tell your story walking.  Move on to the next thing.  Right.  So I read many, many years ago that we're so behind in technology because of big business,  you know, fighting.  They were mad.  We should be so more advanced, but these companies hold on, and they're so powerful that you have 
[00:41:30]  no choice.  Shouldn't it be that way?  Like, the future would be a classroom of kids with their iPads and the teacher going,  okay, open up your app, open up this book, and you're like...  Yeah, open up your app, go to page, whatever, blah, blah, blah.  And instead of kids hunched over like fucking Quasimodo with a big backpack of books as they're  walking...  Isn't that nothing more pathetic than seeing some poor little kid hunched over walking  with a backpack?  He's got back problems at eight years old.  Eight years old!  Yeah.  There's no doctor alive that wouldn't tell you that. 
[00:42:00]  That's really bad for an eight-year-old spy.  Saddle them up like a camel.  But we all ignore.  Yes.  No.  This is the way it's been, so it has to continue.  People would stop getting beaten up because their book bag is on wheels.  They have their little book bag on wheels that they wheel with them.  Like fucking wheelie luggage?  Do they have kids doing that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they have that now?  Oh, absolutely.  Holy shit.  That's retarded.  I would have to beat that kid up, though.  Yeah.  I would kick his fucking ass perb motherfucker.  Yeah.  All right.  And beat him with his luggage.  Sorry.  A lot of people are checking in. 
[00:42:30]  I'm in college.  Every single book I have is on the iPad.  There you go.  Okay.  So that technology is making its way out there.  I didn't know.  Yeah.  Because I do have a few schools in my neighborhood, and I see, like, just describe these kids.  Yeah.  Punched over trying to carry their books on.  Poor little bastards.  So it's not happening in my neighborhood.  Massive L.L. Bean book bags.  Yeah.  All right.  Mike and Jersey.  Every compartment's full of something.  Yeah.  It extends out three feet from their back like a Sherpa.  They have to carry their lunch because there's no room.  No room in there.  A couple things happening.  This guy says he rents college books now, but it seems like it's the same scam. 
[00:43:00]  Same deal.  Right?  Yeah.  You're still paying way too much, and you're not getting...  Oh, wait.  Rent.  That means you're not even getting any money back.  Right.  But maybe renting.  Try to keep the cost down a little bit.  There's probably fees, like, if the book comes back and it's not in perfect shape.  Oh, man.  I wish I remember my numbers, but I think it was, like, easily 500 bucks a semester.  Holy shit.  And then at the end of the semester, you wanted a little drinking money.  You're always searching out drinking money in college, and I'm like, holy fuck, I could 
[00:43:30]  bring my books back.  I don't need them anymore because we're in finals now, and I'm ready.  I could drink my books.  And then you would bring them all back, like a huge stack, and the guy would give you,  like, I'm just going to make this shit up, but it's about right.  They'd give you, like, 40 bucks.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And then you would go to some kind of fucking, you know, drink special at a bar and drink  your textbook money.  And then it's gone.  And then that's it.  And yet, it costs you 500 bucks.  All the knowledge is still in the books.  It's not like, well, you took a chunk of this knowledge out. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, dude, they would, they would, it's sort of coming back to me, they would study your  books like, oh, look, there's, you know, a scuff mark here.  Who gives a shit?  We're going to have to take another $10 off of this book.  Oh, look, this page is slightly ripped in the corner.  Oh, you folded this page over.  It's not a collector's item.  Like, who gives a fuck?  I loved getting the used textbooks where they fucking highlighted everything I needed to  know.  That was the best.  Margin notes.  Everything.  I actually would search out the, but a lot of, you know, there's so much that you would 
[00:44:30]  search out the used books, right?  But then, you know, these teachers got smart and it would be a new edition and they would  insist you can't, you only could get the new edition because they were getting, obviously  a kickback from the textbook company.  And the new edition meant that all the pages were fucked up.  So if the teacher said page 50 in your, in your used book that you said, fuck that, fuck  you, you had to find it, which would be 35 or whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was such a scam.  And then those stores, like they just keep making money on the same books. 
[00:45:00]  Because like you said, over and over again, you buy the used book and then you sell it  back for even less.  Right.  But then they just sell it as a used book again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The price that you initially pay.  So they're selling the same book four or five, six times.  Yeah.  That new again.  Until the teachers scamming and saying, well, now the teachers would write their own textbooks  and they would make a new edition every year because they want to get new money coming in  every semester.  Yep.  And the students just have to fucking deal with it or used to. 
[00:45:30]  I don't know.  Like I said, I'm a little behind on this whole thing, but because it seems like a lot of people  are getting their iPads in school now.  Oh.  Well, good for them.  Yeah.  Some new technology like the future.  You know, because when you thought about the year 2000, I kind of envisioned, you know,  that the old shit wasn't going to be the same.  They were going to have computers and electronics doing things.  Robot teachers.  Robot teachers.  Now when you think about the year 2000, it just seems outdated. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Now it's like, oh, year 2000.  Yeah, it is outdated.  It's like old.  It is old.  Yeah.  This guy's saying $300 a book, over $1,000 a semester on books.  Wow.  And then, yeah, you'll get pennies on the dollar when you sell them back to them.  All right.  Fuckers.  Oh, there's that.  I want to see that clip.  Oh, you want to see this?  Steve Jobs.  Josh Gad is in it, too.  Oh, is he?  No, I know.  No, in this clip, I mean.  Oh, yeah, because he told us that last Friday, I believe.  Yeah.  From 1,600. 
[00:46:30]  Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs.  What's the name of the movie?  Jobs.  Jobs?  Jobs.  Why does Ashton Kutcher look like Ashton Kutcher?  He's just got a beard.  And his hair is a little swoopy, but it's the same.  He looks like Ashton Kutcher.  It's going to take me out of the movie.  It's the whole fucking Mark Wahlberg thing.  He sounds like Ashton Kutcher.  He walks like Ashton Kutcher.  Might as well be punked.  He's Ashton Kutcher.  Does he punk Waz?  Waz?  I got a little inside story about this. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, do you?  I was a little worried about telling it, but now I don't think I'm calling out this person  that told me.  When I was in L.A. filming that thing, there was a guy, let's just say a guy that's close  to Ashton Kutcher.  This is the story he told me.  He got in trouble with Ashton Kutcher.  And this guy kind of might work for a company that might have been involved with my thing.  Oh, boy.  Gossip.  And this guy goes, I got in trouble because Ashton Kutcher came back from doing the Steve 
[00:47:30]  Jobs movie.  And he said, and I quote, and I swear to this, Ashton Kutcher goes, you know what?  I think I could run Apple.  Oh.  Because he did the movie.  He did the movie.  Because he was Steve Jobs.  He goes, you know what?  I think I could run Apple.  And of course, this guy, who felt like he was close enough to Ashton Kutcher, laughed  at him.  Said, that's ridiculous.  Some tells me Ashton doesn't like being laughed at. 
[00:48:00]  He got so fucking pissed, and this person got reprimanded severely for laughing at the  fact that he called him out on his comment, that he can now run Apple because he played  Steve Jobs in a movie.  Tell him he's Kelso and shut the fuck up.  Yeah, hey, Kelso.  This was a true story told to me when I was out in L.A. about a week or so ago.  What a douche.  Did you pull that mic forward?  Yeah.  Yeah, that little nub.  There it is.  All right, let's see Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs. 
[00:48:30]  All right.  Oh, very excited.  It's the Industrial Revolution.  No more decks.  No more mainframes.  That changes everything.  It's pretty cool, I guess.  By Charlie and Kuhn.  Amazing.  It's profound.  How could you not tell me about this before?  I was just working on it for my own.  It was a hug.  Exactly.  Exactly.  For your own.  For you.  It's what you wanted.  It's what your gut and your instinct wanted.  Your big vocal brain wanted something that didn't exist.  No, it's Ashton Kutcher.  You just wheeled it into existence. 
[00:49:00]  What do you call the system?  The operating system.  The operating system.  That's what I call it.  Yeah, it's just a real-time display of current operations.  You can see what you're working on.  Get over how ridiculous Josh Gad is.  I am not feeling that this is Steve Jobs at all.  Pause.  Pause.  Josh Gad has long, curly, permy hair.  Yeah.  But he's doing great because he doesn't...  It's not Josh Gad-y.  I don't feel like I'm looking at Josh Gad.  Right.  I feel like I'm looking at Ashton Kutcher.  Ashton Kutcher is so Ashton Kutcher-y in this. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  It's like when they showed the still picture of Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs, they did something  with the lighting and everything, and he kind of looked like...  Yeah, it was pretty amazing.  Steve Jobs.  Yes.  Right here, it's Kelso.  Well, you can tell.  He's still working out.  He still wants to be sexy.  He still wants to be like...  He's got to be sexy.  Yeah, the chicks still got to dig me just because I'm talking about computers.  Right, right.  Yeah, why wouldn't Ashton Kutcher soften his body for the role?  Right.  I don't think Steve Jobs was in the weight room.  No, he's not working out.  No, I don't think so. 
[00:50:00]  And he has cool guy confidence, not nerd confidence.  No.  Like, he's almost got to come off like Asperger's-y, you know what I mean, when he's talking about  computers?  Not like, hey, I got this idea.  Steve Jobs had some personality, though.  Well, nerd personality.  Yeah, he was still a nerd.  In the end, he was still a nerd, you think?  Definitely.  Fair enough.  Let's watch this clip from the movie Kutcher.  To create and to do and to build as artists, as individuals. 
[00:50:30]  Look, you're overreacting.  I mean, even if you were developing this for Freaks Like Us, and I doubt you are, nobody  wants to buy a computer.  Nobody.  How does somebody know what they want if they've never even seen it?  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Wow.  This is that profound talk where it's like, see where that went?  Huh?  Look what they're talking about.  But then people did want it.  Like, Josh Gad is acting.  Yeah.  And Ashton Kutcher is just like, Ashton.  I'm Ashton.  Whoa! 
[00:51:00]  He's just being Ashton Kutcher.  Might as well be butterfly effect.  Oh, right.  Same thing.  He's punking people.  Yeah.  Should I have a trucker?  I'm going to wear a trucker hat as Steve Jobs.  What do you think?  A trucker hat?  Yes.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, Chris.  Was this the blonde?  The blonde.  The Starbucks?  You brought me the blonde, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Because I trashed it.  The white.  I trashed it on the radio.  I want to make sure that you definitely got me the blonde.  There was no difference to me in taste. 
[00:51:30]  As Starbucks runs all these commercials saying they're doing a lighter blend called blonde.  In that paper.  Blonde blend.  Blonde blend.  Did Noah Wiley, he played Steve Jobs?  I'm hearing he did a pretty good job.  He did pretty good.  That was on the TNT movie, Pirates of Silicon Valley.  Ah.  And you know who played Bill Gates?  Who was that?  What's his name from Weird Science?  Weird Science.  Anthony Michael Hall.  Anthony Michael Hall.  Oh, that's right.  That was a good movie.  Weird Science. 
[00:52:00]  Much better than that.  Weird News.  That was Scorch's bed.  Weird News.  Weird News.  Oh, yes.  Weird News.  Why don't we do Scorch Bits anymore?  What happened?  What's going on with this show?  Yes, we really should.  I've gotten tipped off.  What happened?  And we can continue to do Scorch Bits.  What do you mean you've been tipped off?  There's some new projects being worked on.  I love Scorch.  I gotta know what Scorch is up there. 
[00:52:30]  It's been so long.  Yeah.  Weird News.  Weird News.  Weird News.  And then the person came up and then the other guy wasn't even in the apartment.  But anyway.  Yeah, anyway.  So the dog ain't tacked in, man.  But, you know, it's one of those things.  Doggy dog and know what I mean.  It's a doggy dog world, isn't it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Scorch knows we love him, right?  It's a little confusing, I know.  We love him.  Colin Quinn can't get enough of Scorch.  Colin loves Scorch.  It hasn't been the same since one of our fans dumped yellow paint on him while he was 
[00:53:00]  trying to raise money for that.  That was bad.  What do you got there?  Weird News.  Colin Quinn loves the weirdest shit about our show.  Oh, yeah.  He loves Scorch and he loved...  He loved the retarded Laverna Shirley.  Yeah, Lady Diane Manning.  Yes, yes.  And Patty.  He put Patty on his TV show.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Right.  He does love a good freak.  So why don't we...  BFG TV.  I don't want to distract people.  Good.  Wait, you got one right there?  Weird News.  You'll have to take a break.  Look at him. 
[00:53:30]  Remember that picture?  He doesn't even have a laptop that looks up to date.  What is he doing?  What is he doing?  Is this from that bar slash restaurant?  I don't know if this one is.  Remember the picture we had from the bar?  This looks like it's in a Holiday Inn.  In the lobby.  He did the wide shot so you could see that there was like three people.  There was no one there, but then he put in fake applause and...  What is this from?  Oh, this is relatively recent.  Three months ago.  This is the new shit.  Three months ago, 89 views.  He's fucking rocking it still.  Oh, yeah.  And it looks like he's in front of a reception desk for a hotel. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Wait, there's the fucking luggage.  Hey, wait a minute.  There's a luggage rack.  So he is.  In the hotel.  Wait, but is that a tap?  Is that a beer tap?  No.  This blue thing?  Oh, maybe.  Maybe he's at the bar.  Oh, I see.  It looked like a luggage rack.  Is it a closed bar?  That's a sad bar.  It has one tap.  I don't know what is going on here.  It has one beer tap.  Eee.  All right.  Can we...  All right.  You know what?  Can we just start the thing?  Yeah, let's hear it.  You just want to give it up to the taste.  I want to hear it from the beginning.  Just a little taste. 
[00:54:30]  I want to hear it from the opening and everything, right?  Yeah, what the hell?  Yeah, let's hear it from the opening.  I love the opening.  Fake applause.  From BFG Television Center.  From BFG Television Center.  This is Fortune BFG TV.  Listen to...  What is he doing?  He's walking out like he's Letterman. 
[00:55:00]  He's got a band now.  He's...  This is like what you do in your house if you're eight years old.  To be like a talk show host.  He's got that Joe Biden thing.  He does.  Absolutely.  You're right.  Oh, my God.  I can't get enough of Joe Biden because I'll say it again.  He just...  Joe Biden thinks everyone's there for him.  Yeah.  He's like, oh, this Barack Obama inauguration, that's all cute and all, but I know they're  all here for me.  And Scorch is all about that.  God bless him.  Do you know how much easier life would be if you could walk around with Scorch's mind? 
[00:55:30]  Oh.  Like with the ability that he...  In every essence of his brain, he believes that he is the shit.  Yes.  And everybody happens to know that.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not going to tell him differently.  Yeah.  Now, there's a band plan.  We're going to laugh at it, but I mean, he goes from PFG TV what?  It's a hotel bar.  Yeah.  But it's his TV fucking...  It's his TV studio.  It's his fucking...  It's PFG TV Central.  And he gets people to buy into it. 
[00:56:00]  He's got a relatively hot girl introing him.  He's got a band.  He's got a band.  He comes out...  They're into it.  He's wearing a white or a beige blazer.  And he comes out and starts pulling at his lapels like, hey, how you doing?  You've got to hear him talk.  Because when Scorch talks, he tells you everything that's coming down the pike.  Right.  Like everything that he's got lined up.  Oh, yeah.  And it's easy to fall into it.  You're like, oh, really?  Oh, you got that lined up?  Oh, wow.  Oh, okay.  Let me stick with this.  And I think it's so cool that you actually interned for him.  Me too.  That's amazing. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, man.  Let's hear a little more.  Do you know how pissed off to this day his former co-host is of all the sort of, this  is what I have lined up, this is what I have lined up, this is what I have lined up.  Look, tomorrow's my last show.  I'm moving without you.  I'm leaving and you ain't coming.  Yeah, they're offering me $28,000.  I can't give you a piece.  Can't split it.  Sorry, wait.  I can't split it.  Got bills to pay. 
[00:57:00]  He cued the band to stop.  I've never had the chance to do this before.  I got to try that again.  Oh, no.  Grassroot, ladies and gentlemen.  The band.  How many people do you think that is?  We haven't seen the crowd yet, but I would guess 25. 
[00:57:30]  I was going to say 10.  Oh, really?  Well, he does do a thing where he obviously makes some kind of deal with a local pizza  spot that he, I mean, he lies about a lot of stuff, but he probably talks to them about  all the plugs and all the viewers and everything, so he gives people free pizza.  And they come down.  If they go to the tapings.  For the free pizza.  But he tells the pizza, I'm sure he gets the pizza for free, because he tells the pizza  place he's got 10,000 international, you know, whatever.  Is he only doing the show quarterly now, or is this the latest one, you think? 
[00:58:00]  Because this is from October.  It's around the latest one.  I don't know if this is the latest latest.  All right.  Fair enough.  Uh-huh.  Oh, my.  I got to say, welcome to the brand new edition of Scorch's PFG TV.  Either else is great.  He is so excited.  I love this.  Just for us.  Just for...  We talk to the world, and we have no excitement.  This guy has 25 people in front of him, and he's like, he is... 
[00:58:30]  He feels like he's at Wembley.  Wembley.  Wembley.  And how many times have we on this show heard him introduce the brand new version?  Oh, yeah.  It's like different plays.  Every time we check in, it's a brand new version.  Yes.  The ninth iteration of PFG TV.  Yeah.  Travis?  What you just said?  You're not even looking at the latest version.  What?  There's a later, later version?  There's a later, later version.  You're looking at season five.  He's already on season six.  Wow.  New place.  New intro.  New place. 
[00:59:00]  We're doing a co-host.  Yeah.  We want the latest, latest.  Okay.  Latest, latest.  So where's his latest, latest?  And where is he now?  And why are all these plays kicking him out?  He's getting a new place.  Yeah.  Because he promised them.  He does one.  Oh, wow.  He promises them.  You could do episode two, but there's also episode one.  We'll do episode two.  Might as well.  He promises them a lot, and then it doesn't come true.  So, and then...  Wow!  He's got graphics.  Wow.  A spinning live graphic.  Yeah.  There's no fucking way that this is live anywhere.  No. 
[00:59:30]  No way.  Wait.  Why the first wheel?  Where is he?  He's probably in Manch Vegas.  Manch Vegas.  Wait.  They have a first wheel up there?  I don't know.  It's just festive.  All right.  BFG Television Center at Red 13 Studio.  Welcome to Scorch's BFG TV.  Oh.  I am Lord Doug Man W.  What?  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Lord.  What the hell's going on?  Who's this 80s rocker guy? 
[01:00:00]  This could be the best, worst TV ever.  I'm going to watch this whole thing tonight.  Tonight, another amazing episode, it says.  Do you see how long it is?  He's doing hour-long shows now.  Holy shit.  Wait a minute.  But he's got some good production behind his open now.  Now he's got some graphics.  Right.  Some fucking.  You think you're watching Kimmel.  That's Lord Doug Man W. Godspeed.  Doug Man.  Not Doug Man.  Doug Man.  He said Lord Doug Man W. Godspeed.  Lord.  Lord Doug Man W. Godspeed. 
[01:00:30]  Look at his face.  He looks like he's in one of those hair bands.  Yes, he looks like he was pulled out of Whitesnake.  Him and Scorch just sit around talking about how awesome they are.  Yeah.  Yeah, I fucking get a lot of chicks too, Scorch.  Yeah.  My favorite part coming up is the contrast between the amazing intro and then.  And the reality of it.  He's broadcasting.  No.  Are you serious?  Because the intro is like a late night talk show.  The background is like Santa Monica Pier, I think. 
[01:01:00]  That's what I was going to say.  This is the problem.  Wait, he's using some stock footage from Santa Monica Harbor.  Yes, it's stock footage.  Of actual cool places.  Yeah.  I could make a whole feature with this stock footage.  I'm Lord Doug Man W. Godspeed.  Tonight, on another amazing episode, comedian Jimmy Dunn promoting his new book, Boat Hatch.  We also have an exclusive interviewer and performance with Bam Margera. 
[01:01:30]  All right.  Good for Scorch.  Here with the two beer guys.  And Scorch is...  He made them pay.  Huh?  He made them pay money.  These guys.  Did he just say that you never heard of them?  Two beer guys?  He made them pay.  He made them pay money.  You know two beer guys?  No, I just know that I know Scorch.  You just know his...  All right.  I don't know, but I know.  All right.  Look at that fucking...  That's LAX.  That's LAX.  Yeah.  It's California.  It's California.  The background is now Los Angeles International Airport.  But he was at Santa Monica Pier. 
[01:02:00]  And there was a first wheel.  Where was the first wheel from?  Yeah, we did something to Hollywood.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Santa Monica Pier as well.  We wanted this to be Hollywood.  Because you know really, it's an international show.  It's not for just...  No one knows where we are.  You want to make it seem like you're in Hollywood.  I just got the numbers back from the UK.  Jesus.  Let's get at least through the intro, and then we'll take a break.  I'm watching this whole thing now.  Legendary rock and roll drummer extraordinaire, Siv Hassan.  From Boston.  And sitting in for grassroots, the Gil Korea Band. 
[01:02:30]  So let's give it up and make some noise for your host.  Oh, my God.  He's in a basement.  What are you doing?  Pause.  Pause.  It went from this big Hollywood intro, and I swear there are literally pipes on the wall.  It looks like it might be someone's house.  It's a warehouse with carpets.  It's either a warehouse or somebody's loft.  It might be someone's loft.  Some kind of oriental rug is on the floor and some bad leather furniture. 
[01:03:00]  There's wires everywhere.  And a horrible coffee table.  There's a white brick wall with pipes on it and a vent.  And lights shining up the walls.  You can tell us that, like, chalky white, like, apartment paint.  Yes.  That's all the old apartments.  Yeah, we're looking for an industrial vibe.  Yeah, I want it to look more industrial.  Oh, my God.  Some little rock and roll.  All right.  This is so fucking good.  All right.  I am fucking so excited right now.  Are you in?  I'm so in. 
[01:03:30]  Let's go.  You're in, Opie?  You're Scorch's big intro now.  Yeah.  All right.  Now the show starts.  All of the Scorch's BFG TV.  Come on up here.  Come on up here.  What the fuck is that?  Oh, you know, Simmy, have a seat for a second because I got a couple of gifts here.  Thank you all very much.  What a great audience.  Give it up for yourselves.  Give yourself a hand.  Give yourself a hand.  Holy smokes.  So we had our Christmas show last week.  I guess this will be our New Year's show because the next time we air will be 2013.  You are correct, sir.  Which is the year. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, his sidekick.  His sidekick.  He's cutting that McNair.  You are correct, sir.  Hey, now.  Yeah, why did he just suck on hey, now?  Exactly.  How many views does this video have?  Let me exit full screen for a moment.  We're at 104.  He is so excited.  And there's 104 views.  If I don't get 20,000 views for one of my dumb videos, I kick myself in the balls.  I get so mad.  Oh, my God.  We can learn from him is what I'm saying. 
[01:04:30]  The energy, the excitement.  He puts behind 104 of you.  Actually, 103 because we're looking at it.  102, I looked at it.  102.  We put it over 100, basically.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's really about what it means to you, not what it means to everybody.  And he shouldn't be mad at us because these videos definitely get a lot of views after we talk about them.  Oh, yeah.  We're pumping it up.  So he better not be mad at us.  Exactly.  He's going to get discovered one day because of us.  Exactly.  I have a feeling this fucking video will hit 1,000 views by Monday because of us. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  People will be searching out the PFG TV.  You guys see the roll of paper towels just hanging out by Scorch's chair?  Yeah.  Paper towels on the floor.  Yeah, it is.  All right, let's go.  Yeah, the crew.  Let's go.  Let's get through the intro.  Then we've got to take a break.  Oh, yeah.  2013 is the year Scorch's PFG TV is going to go national.  You watch this a big time.  All right.  Come on.  This has been an eight-year bit.  He's been saying that. 
[01:05:30]  See, technically, he's already international.  Oh, my God.  I'm on the YouTube.  But didn't he say that he was picked up by channels in England?  He was already.  He said he was in London.  Yeah.  Didn't he say that he's talking to millions or something?  What was the numbers?  He did.  We're talking to millions.  We're syndicated into 150 markets.  That was the first iteration of the PFG TV.  Oh, my God.  He's the best.  He is the greatest thing ever.  Ever.  And he gets everyone to believe him.  Yes, he does. 
[01:06:00]  Because that guy's not faking it.  He always has.  I can't believe this sidekick guy can't believe he's in front of great men.  2013, national.  Well, that's what I told you.  He pitched this to the sidekick, and the sidekick doesn't know that it's all bullshit.  Right.  That someday Scorch is going to go, hey, we're packing it up.  No more PFG TV.  Scorch could be the greatest catfisher ever.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  He might be a catfisher.  He's got a lot of PFG disciples.  Yes.  PFG disciples.  Naked PFG disciples. 
[01:06:30]  Big time.  I'm bringing everybody with us.  All of y'all.  And I ask you, how can you not go national when you bring the co-host like Sibby Hashan  a roll of paper towels?  That's Sibby?  Because of the guest last week.  You've called me every night on the show.  Wait, that's Sibby?  No.  We were looking at an old picture of him with the fucking giant afro.  Oh, my God.  We used to drink with him.  Yeah.  Drummer, right?  Drummer from Boston.  Of Boston.  Well, we used to be up there in Boston.  He used to hang around a lot.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  That's him?  Why don't we talk about barbecues for heat?  Yeah.  Putting it in your bedroom.  He looks good, but he looks completely different.  He's got glasses now, and his hair is not as afro-y.  No.  He's still got a full head of hair, though.  I got this big TV deal I want to get you in on on the ground floor.  Sibby, come here.  We're going to do a fucking PMG TV show.  It's going to be great.  It's only going to cost you $100.  He's so psyched to be there.  I'm amazed.  All right.  This guy played in front of fucking stadiums of people. 
[01:07:30]  Some would say he was part of some of the greatest albums of all time.  Ever made.  Ever made.  Oh, my God.  That first Boston album is right up there.  You are correct, sir.  All right.  Let's see.  Last week, not all.  Every night this week, you're like, is Lacey Rain coming back?  So I know you have thoughts about her.  She's not here this week, but here.  For when you are.  Oh, I appreciate that.  Okay.  And that.  Yeah, I doubt that's what you're going to do with it, Sibby. 
[01:08:00]  That right there is the quicker picker-upper.  So since you're the quicker releaser, you know what I mean?  I'll pick it up.  Are you talking to my wife?  What?  Hey, let me ask you this.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Hey, jerk off.  Clean it up in a paper towel.  What happened?  They got great chemistry.  We had a pretty big drop-off from the big intro.  Well, everybody knows if you're going to do a jerk-off joke, roll a paper towel is always  better than a box of tissues.  Sure.  Yeah.  Who associates tissues with jerking off?  It should have been tissues. 
[01:08:30]  Paper towels.  But now we know why the paper towels were there.  Oh, my God.  They were setting up for his bit.  Quicker picker-upper-upper-upper-upper-upper-upper.  I got a great opening bit.  Give me some paper towels.  Don't forget to laugh at my jokes, you fucking asshole.  Don't fucking laugh.  No, he doesn't ever get mad.  No, he thinks everyone's laughing.  He laughs.  He has no idea that people might not be laughing.  I'm killing.  I'm killing.  Hit it.  Don't try it.  Don't try it.  For those that don't understand, Sibby, what was that band that you used to play in way  back when? 
[01:09:00]  Oh, good.  Just another band out of Boston.  Oh.  On the road, trying to make ends meet.  Playing in the car, sleeping in the bars.  You played with Robin Lane in the Chart Busters?  Did you know Robin?  I know Robin Lane very well.  Sibby from Boston, tell us about the thing you did recently at the Boston.  You did like a Boston montage.  It was a special showing for WBCN.  He's sitting in his big, pretentious chair.  They got cooking back in the late 60s, and they had a special party, and they had a filming 
[01:09:30]  for a documentary.  I love fucking Scorch's chair.  It's giant.  Right up to 1980.  Yeah, but here's got to be a little bigger than yours.  And it will really past 1980.  But it was a lot of fun.  I don't think we need this banter.  And when we got through playing our little memory, he came on, and he said,  You know what?  He said, me and Dennis Eckersley used to go on the rampway between, before the game.  Okay, that's enough of that.  All right, all right.  Luke, Luke, you're slowing down the show.  Wrap it up, buddy. 
[01:10:00]  Where's the monologue?  Wrap it up.  Sibby's like, dude, I've never smoked pot with you in my life.  Sibby, I've said in the last episode, which you can find on Scorch's PFGTV.com.  Your next book.  Doesn't really burn.  You know, that was, you know.  Well, wait a minute.  Let's not go that far.  Only when you're in the sun.  I don't burn my trash.  You know.  I put it out on the side.  But I've got to tell you something.  I've never said this before.  Oh, my God.  Here we go.  No, no.  But it is an honor to have you as part of the TV show. 
[01:10:30]  I love you.  I'm a maudlin.  Yeah, yeah.  Think about that.  It's not a TV show.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's not a TV show.  When I used to hang out in Jack Walsh's driveway in Hall, Massachusetts, listening to this little  portable cassette player listening to Boston.  It was me.  Who would have thought then that, like, you'd be sinking down so low.  So you'd be in a rock and roll Hall of Fame band and I'd be doing this show.  You know what I mean?  Well, wait a minute.  You said the check's in the mail.  A little self-deprecation.  A little self-deprecation.  I'm not being serious. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, yeah.  No, no.  It's a great show.  It's a great show.  It's going to be national this year.  Wow.  What's up with the coffee table?  Yeah.  You hate it, huh?  It's like a canoe.  Why are they doing this in front of a canoe?  This is so bad.  I love it.  Hey.  Yeah, okay.  Okay.  Yeah, you know.  Colin would be loving this, man.  I celebrated Hanukkah.  Anyway, Shelby, hope everything's all well.  We'll see you again in a couple of weeks.  Grassroot.  Hope you guys are doing well on your tour.  Jimmy Dung coming up in a little bit. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, Jimmy.  Where are they going?  Also, just coming up in a little bit like he's going to.  The funny thing is, I love the Red 13 media people.  I'm the type of guy that needs like a babysitter.  Oh, boy.  And the two big guys are here.  Yeah.  And it's nice because they've come up to me quite a few times.  They said, look, we know you.  Don't get too drunk.  So, the two beer guys are here.  He's magic.  He's fucking magic. 
[01:12:00]  Wow.  Who needs metaphor when you can go literal?  Don't get too drunk.  Those guys got beer.  Holy fuck.  You like beer, Scorch?  A little more and then we'll take a break.  I can't stop, though.  This is fucking great.  Hmm.  I love it.  Yeah.  And extra special guest today on the program, the last show of the year.  How about ending the show?  I said it was the first show of the year.  With Ben Margera going to be on the show.  Oh, man.  So, let's start off with our segment that we call Weird News. 
[01:12:30]  Oh.  Come on.  You know, we've got to continue.  Where's the music?  Once again, I've got to do this every show.  Let's start off.  Once again, let's start off with our segment that we call Weird News.  Whoa.  The winner, the better.  I'm upset.  Eric Smith.  Yeah, we're just going to hear weird news.  Getting a drill.  He got sued.  And I saw this thing.  He got sued. 
[01:13:00]  What time are you on?  Two to seven in the afternoon.  Maggie Thurman.  Although, the way the radio business is, by the time this thing airs, this could be my  only show.  Oh.  Why is he putting on an imaginary hat?  Yeah.  He is, right?  Yeah, he's not wearing a hat.  What is that?  But he's pulling on an imaginary brim of his hat.  Is it part of Weird News, maybe?  I think.  Weird News.  I think it's a Weird News thing.  Yeah, I had the people that wrote that weird science song, send me a cease and desist.  Right.  Their lawyers are tough.  I'm not allowed to play Weird News. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  And I saw this thing.  I actually posted it on my radio station website at rock101fm.com.  What time are you on?  Two to seven in the afternoon.  Thank you, Tony.  Although, the way the radio business is, by the time this thing airs, this could be my  only show.  But he had a drill bit going right through his head.  And he said he didn't realize that it happened.  He was trying to do something.  He was trying to cushion it.  And he didn't realize that it had happened.  And he said he will never have that kind of pain again after he got his arm cut off by 
[01:14:00]  a wind turbine.  Oh, my God.  How the hell?  What's this guy up to?  What's this guy up to?  Well, he was using his head for pressure on the drill bit, right?  Well, that's it, yes.  So, I'm going to do three stories this time.  Because this is...  Oh, but maybe we ought to save the stories till after a break.  You think?  What we do is we tell the story.  We don't write jokes.  We riff.  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Just see what the chemistry's like.  I love this shit.  I can't get enough of Scorch.  I'm going to be watching all weekend long.  I know.  It's going to be a marathon.  It's just amazing.  It's so good.  It's just amazing.  It's the best thing ever.  Why doesn't this have a million views?  There's 99.99% of the people would have gave up a long time ago.  Oh, my God.  Not Scorch.  You know, we all try shit if it doesn't work. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  Fuck.  But he will just keep going.  He's the man.  Scorch should just be like, yeah, let me tell you something.  This is a Ford truck.  And this is built Ford tough.  And you get in there and we'll take it for a test drive.  That's where he should be.  He should absolutely be selling cars.  Oh, God, yeah.  He would be a great pitch, man.  But here he is.  PFG TV.  In front of 2013 is the year.  Season 6.  They got a shade down. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Because they got to keep the light out.  Do you see the shade?  Do you see the shade?  Yeah.  Can you see the light coming through the...  Yeah.  They have a shade trying to blend into the wall.  Oh, my God.  It's the white wall.  And I did the intro from California.  Yeah.  Big, glamorous Hollywood intro.  That's a pottery barn chair, too.  Oh.  Weird news.  I used to have one of those.  Not that it matters.  Wow.  All right.  Maybe we'll continue with this.  I think you should. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  We got to do Teo shit, too.  Yeah.  Teo!  Teo.  Anything from Scott and Todd yet?  That's weird news.  They did a song, but I don't know what it's about.  What do you mean?  It's just...  It's about a...  It's called Manho.  But I don't know...  It has nothing to do with...  Wait.  It's a Teo song?  No, it's not.  It's not topical.  Yeah.  They did one song this morning.  I don't know what it's about.  They have not touched...  Well, we got to play it anyway.  Well, we'll have to hear it.  I have it ready, but...  All right.  So we got another...  And we'll be back with the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:16:30]  You're listening to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I don't even know why I bother, but... 
[01:17:00]  Got another guy saying that...  Yeah, you guys shut down Blank and tons of others who were providing replays and or clips of the show over the recent years.  Oh, boy.  Listen to the first part of the show today.  We explained everything.  You dickbag.  It's exhausting because no one will listen. 
[01:17:30]  Why would me and Ant personally have clips taken down off YouTube?  Yeah.  We explained the whole thing at the top of the show.  So listen to the fucking replay.  We're not happy about it, and we had nothing to do with it.  People on Twitter and whatnot, you just can't get it through their heads sometimes.  It's amazing.  It really is.  Last night I was having a little discussion.  Apparently there's that whole conspiracy thing about the school shooting. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  Which one?  Where there were more people involved?  Yeah, there's that part of it, and then there's the weapon part of it.  Can I say just one thing about that?  Yeah, sure.  Because they go with news clips.  Like the news is this sacred thing that gets everything right.  Obviously part of that video, the conspiracy video, is people going, yeah, I saw them with  there was a guy in the woods, and now he's in a cop car.  They arrested him.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, the police are going to be fucking taking anyone down that's in the area to see if they 
[01:18:30]  have something to do with it.  But that doesn't mean that that person had anything to do with it.  Exactly.  Exactly.  So yeah, they had an eyewitness that says, uh, we saw someone in the woods and the police  took that guy away.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah.  Who was that guy in the woods?  Was he just a guy walking his stupid dog?  Walking through the woods.  Or maybe he did have something to do with it, but that's what the cops would figure out.  And it turns out, he didn't have anything to do with it.  It was all the one guy, that stupid fucking douchebag. 
[01:19:00]  But then these conspiracy assholes take that clip because it was on the news, like, see?  They put it together in a little documentary form, and people are giving me links to this  thing.  Hey, did he check this out?  I'm like, you are a fucking idiot.  And then they're like, what happened to that guy?  Well, what happened to that guy?  They question him, and they're pretty certain that he had nothing to do with it.  He happened to be in the area.  That's what happened to that guy.  And the news is completely fucked up as far as getting shit wrong in this day and age. 
[01:19:30]  They get things wrong all the time.  Because they're trying to be the first ones.  Right.  Oh, we'll be the first ones that get the fucking news out.  So they just go on with anything.  Right.  And that's what they did in this situation.  So the guns that we use is the big issue.  They're saying that the conspiracy is that this was planted, that they tried to make it  seem like an AR-15 rifle was used, assault weapon, so they could go forward with this  assault weapons ban.  Right.  But the truth of the matter is, the AR-15 was left in the trunk of the guy's vehicle. 
[01:20:00]  He never even used it.  He had four handguns on him.  Listen to this news clip.  Meanwhile, the news clip is from an hour after it happened.  They're getting everything wrong.  Right.  And then it's like, there's another one from the next day, and that was wrong.  The truth of the matter is, and they go, here's the video of them looking at the assault  rifle in the trunk.  This is a video from a helicopter that's looking down on the car.  And the type of shotgun that was in the trunk, because it was a shotgun, looks like an assault  weapon. 
[01:20:30]  It doesn't look like an old shotgun.  It's got a detachable magazine.  It's got the barrel with the flash suppressor on the air.  It looks like it could have been an AR-15.  Right.  But it's the type of shotgun it was.  So an AR-15 wasn't used in this?  It was.  It was absolutely used.  So an assault weapon was used?  Yes.  Okay.  It was used.  But these conspiracy guys are saying, they're lying to us because they said four handguns  were used.  It's like, no, the guy had a total of four guns.  He had two pistols.  On his body?  No.  One, the shotgun was in the trunk.  Right.  Okay. 
[01:21:00]  He had two handguns on him.  Right.  And he had the AR-15 rifle.  Right.  And that's what he used for the majority of his killing.  I think the only thing he used a pistol for was his own head.  So they're trying to say an assault weapon wasn't used?  Wasn't used.  And that's the conspiracy?  But they're pumping it up that it was so they could push this.  So they could take the assault weapon away.  Anti-gun legislation.  Right.  Which, you know, makes a great story.  It's not true.  I had to fucking...  I didn't have to.  I felt compelled to tweet people last night that kept tweeting, nope, then how did it 
[01:21:30]  end up in the trunk?  How did the assault weapon...  It's not.  It wasn't.  It wasn't there.  Oh, link it to the story.  I don't believe you.  I was like, okay, how about I know a guy that was there, that fucking went there and saw  the rifle laying next to the dead fucking gunman?  The AR-15.  How about that?  How about that?  Yeah, we might have heard more than what was said on the media.  But people will not stop with this fucking clip that they keep trying to send me of this 
[01:22:00]  guy that put together this just horse shit, random horse shit of early newscasts that got  everything wrong.  What surprises me is the amount of people that are, you know, buying into these conspiracy  theories all the time.  All the time.  Of course you expect people to, you know, buy into some conspiracies, but the amount of  people, that's what's pretty amazing to me.  And the fucked up thing is they discount the simplest solution for no reason whatsoever. 
[01:22:30]  Like, if you have a reason to go like, wow, there's some heavy motivation for this or  that and the simplest thing, but there's a problem there.  No, take the simplest reason and way that something happened, and that's probably how  it happened.  Right.  This convoluted conspiracy thing that everyone wants to throw out for every situation, and  then you realize the government can't fucking wipe its own ass, and it might cover up something.  I'm not a big fan of the government in general, but I can't even imagine. 
[01:23:00]  And they do shitty things.  Yeah.  Of course they do.  But I can't imagine.  It doesn't mean they have.  It's an iota that they're going to fucking take out kids to push an agenda forward.  Would they use what happened to push an agenda forward?  Absolutely.  Our government does that all the time.  That I absolutely believe they're doing.  They're using this tragedy to push forward their agenda.  I talked about on, I think, Rogan's podcast about 9-11.  And I'm like, I'm suspicious of some things.  Like, maybe, maybe, you know, the government knew that something could happen in New York, 
[01:23:30]  and maybe, maybe they could have allowed it to happen to push an agenda forward.  I could see our government possibly doing that.  Yes.  But to actually plan it?  Fuck no.  Fuck no.  And not to the extent of taking two towers down and killing thousands of people.  Like, I could see, because it was the Gulf of Tonkin incident, a false flag.  Yeah, okay. 
[01:24:00]  Like, they've done things like that in the past, but it doesn't mean that everything that happens  is a conspiracy.  Right, right.  Like I said, a mere couple minutes ago, our government does do shitty things.  Yes.  But to that extent, I'm sorry, I'm out.  That's where I go.  Yeah.  I'm out.  I'm out.  Jesus.  We're going to learn about pelicans in a few minutes.  Fly, pelican.  We're going to learn about pelicans.  Hey, yeah, from fucking...  Yeah, Scarface.  Scarface.  Pelican.  Pelican.  He's in the bathtub, right?  Yeah, in the bathtub.  Looking at the pelicans. 
[01:24:30]  Look at him.  Yeah, get rid of that mic.  Give her a fucking quail.  She'll love me in the morning.  I want to...  I think this might be a gag, but let's just go with it.  Linda, what's up?  Hi, Obi.  Dick's Hills.  Check it in.  Yes.  Oh, I love you so much.  You've been calling all morning.  I love you so much.  All of your political views and just the way that you view the world.  I agree with you a thousand percent.  And you're like a long...  I found a fan!  I found a fan! 
[01:25:00]  You are brilliant.  And you speak voices where, like, you're just basically on everybody's mind.  And we all love you so much.  Does she have the right person?  Yes.  Yes.  Son of a bitch.  Yes, she does.  I got my fans, too.  But wait a minute.  What about me?  No, it's not about you this time.  Damn it.  It'll be about you in a few minutes.  Son of a bitch.  I get one every once in a while.  Wait, wait.  What...  I get one.  But what political...  But you never talk...  Shh!  Shut up.  What political views? 
[01:25:30]  Shut up.  My very...  My vague political views that kind of...  I'm like a...  I'm like a slalom skier.  Linda?  Shut up!  Let me have this one.  I'm hanging up on her.  Shut up.  Oh, man.  Shut up.  Oh, man.  My political is kind of like...  It's a little moderate.  It's a little against the government.  It's...  I don't believe the horse shit.  Shut up.  All right.  Let me have one.  She's gone. 
[01:26:00]  She's a fan.  That's cool.  All right.  We got PFG TV.  Weird news.  We also have the Scott and Todd parodies.  I hear you.  Hopefully, we'll have a Jim Chandler update today.  I saw some tweets last night.  Yeah.  My name was in there.  Your name was in there.  Jim Chandler's name was in there.  And some of the fans are saying...  Nice things, right?  Yeah.  That it's his turn to reach out.  It's his turn, right?  Yes.  I think I've made it very clear that I'm willing to push this relationship forward. 
[01:26:30]  A lot of people getting on him.  Any tweets lately?  Has he responded?  Jim Chandler?  Comment?  My old pal who I started radio with when I was 18?  Nothing?  I stole this sketch of James Woods from the set of Saturday Night Live several years ago  after the show.  What?  The guy was in New York and didn't look me up.  Son of a bitch.  The part of Manti Teo's girlfriend will be played by...  Claude Rains.  I don't know. 
[01:27:00]  Shots.  Wow.  That's old.  All right.  Look.  We'll move on.  Teo was on Katie's show there.  Yeah.  I watched a little bit.  It was kind of boring TV.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We did answer some questions.  She's no Oprah.  She's no Oprah.  Yeah.  And we have all these clips, really?  We don't have to play.  Where are we at with Teo?  I want to play the voicemails.  I'm starting to lean now.  That he's just a complete fool?  That he's a dumb fuck. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  He's a complete fool?  He's just a dumb fuck.  Are we adding to our facts checklist?  Well, he said on the show with Katie that he's Samoan.  Samoan?  Samoan.  But I don't know if I want to edit the he might be Samoan or Hawaiian.  Probably Hawaiian.  But he's both.  Most people are now saying he's Samoan.  He's Samoan Hawaiian.  No.  He's Samoan, but was brought up in Hawaiian.  In Hawaii.  Okay.  Then I don't know if I want to edit that fact. 
[01:28:00]  We could get rid of the long shot Spanish on dead grandma's side.  That's still a long shot.  What are we going to do with these Katie clips?  There's a lot of them.  Play the pertinent ones.  You know what?  They don't have the full story here.  Something else is going on.  Yeah.  I mean, you can't get past the fact they keep talking about this girlfriend of his.  The fact is he never had physical contact with this girl.  Exactly.  But I think he explains that.  So what is that?  How does he explain that?  That he's an idiot. 
[01:28:30]  And now there's a couple people really digging.  And it turns out he was in the same city as this girl, but didn't visit her.  Yeah.  Katie asked him about that.  And he did try some type of Skype or video thing, right?  Yeah.  Katie asked him about that.  But the screen came up blank for him to see.  And she was like, I see you.  I see my camera.  That's a scam on her part, obviously.  They faced him twice.  But he couldn't see her.  Both times he couldn't see her.  And he bought it, supposedly.  He's just a dumb fuck. 
[01:29:00]  He was two hours away from her while she was in the hospital.  Right.  But he didn't want to change his flight to go visit her.  I wouldn't either.  Yeah, why would you do that?  It's just your true love dying of leukemia.  Why wouldn't you?  You know.  Why wouldn't you?  Whatever.  Too much of a hassle?  Yeah, it's a hassle.  You know what it is to change a flight, Opie?  Come on.  True.  Come on.  She's going to have leukemia for a while.  You can see her.  The airlines will fuck you over if you change a flight.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a pain in the ass.  A couple hundred bucks if you do that?  Yeah, we all know how big of a pain in the ass it is.  Why change the flight?  And Katie asked what she said. 
[01:29:30]  You're either the most naive person on Earth.  Or a dumb fuck.  Or this is just a sad story.  He's naive.  He's dumb.  But there's something else still.  Could be Queeber Quay.  Possibly.  He says far from it.  He denies.  He goes far from it.  He pretty much said, Katie, I love fucking chicks.  I'm all about the pussy.  I love tits.  Yeah.  You guys are crazy.  I guess we could play a few clips from the top, and then when we get bored, we'll move 
[01:30:00]  on to something else.  Yeah.  Let's start with this.  Did you have any involvement in creating the scam?  No.  I did not.  I think what people don't realize is that the same day that everybody else found out about  this situation, I found out.  Really?  See, I got the call on December 6th saying that she was alive.  And from December 6th to January 16th, my whole reality was that she was dead, and all of 
[01:30:30]  a sudden, she's alive.  At that time, I didn't know that it was just somebody's prank.  He's just stupid.  He really is a adult.  And he's going to be playing in the NFL.  And he's going to be pretty good in the NFL.  You got to realize something.  Not everyone is bright.  This guy is a dummy.  Right.  He is stupid.  He's stupid.  Yeah, it just shows you that these college athletes get a pass.  Yeah.  You don't have to be smart to go to college.  We're putting this guy in the context of being a smart guy and like, how could he not 
[01:31:00]  know?  Why didn't he do this?  You got to realize, he's bordering on retarded.  This motherfucker is stupid.  We said yesterday, you might have a taste or a couple drops of the DS.  Of DS, yeah.  Of DS.  And I apologize for the people that have to deal with that.  Yeah.  But it's important to the conversation here.  He might have a few drops himself.  A couple of drops.  He's not that much smarter than our own Bobo.  No.  No.  Bobo falls into this shit. 
[01:31:30]  And think about it.  Right.  Not a star athlete for Notre Dame.  When you see Bobo in love, fucking head over heels in love with a girl that he only  knows from Twitter.  Right.  Not even the internet or emails or anything.  Voicemails.  Nothing.  From Twitter.  Just from 140 characters going back and forth.  And he professes his love on a daily basis to her.  You realize, people can be this stupid.  Oh yeah.  Our own Bobo.  And Manti. 
[01:32:00]  Because they fall in love and they just want to believe it.  And they're stupid.  I believe he's naive.  I believe he's stupid.  But I'm telling you, there's still something that's not right.  Two syllable stupid name.  Bobo.  Manti.  Yeah.  Right.  It's all fitting together.  Maloonigans.  Maloonigans.  I think we've all been duped in our lives.  But it gets to a point where you're like, holy fuck, I'm getting duped.  Yeah.  And then you tap out.  Well, this guy couldn't fucking tap out because he's a moron.  Right. 
[01:32:30]  It was reported in Deadspin that you and Renaya were family.  Someone's called you family or at least family friends.  Were you?  No.  No, I've previously, previous to that conversation that he and I had on January 16th.  For the show.  I had only talked to Renaya twice.  Right.  He, from my understanding, was Linnea's cousin.  And was Linnea's favorite cousin.  And the only time I would talk to Renaya was when I couldn't find Linnea. 
[01:33:00]  He's dumb.  He's dumb.  I couldn't find Linnea right.  Look, he never was my friend right.  I don't know what you're talking about.  This is what it is.  I just want to get back in the football game.  Renaya pushed this whole thing forward.  He's really dumb.  Right.  Teo.  Renaya must have known he was a stupid guy, though.  Yeah, that he's going to fall for it.  Like, let's goof on.  You know how we goof on Bobo?  Right.  That's how it must have been.  Like, oh, man, let's fucking.  Let's see if we can get him to go on ESPN and talk about this fake girl we made up. 
[01:33:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  That's exactly.  I'm fucking.  That's exactly it.  Look at it in the context of Bobo.  We've called him.  You guys back in the office have called him and done things.  We have him on the show and we do things.  That's what it is.  This guy knew him.  And it's like, you know what?  You know fucking Manti slash Bobo?  Let's fucking call him.  We'll make this whole girlfriend thing.  It'll be hilarious.  We'll get him to say curse words on a bus.  Or we'll get this guy to go on ESPN and talk about this fake girl. 
[01:34:00]  Let's get him to smash pots and pans and wake his family up.  Or let's get this guy to talk about his dead girlfriend.  You think he's a virgin?  Oh, I just want to lose it.  Right.  I don't know.  You think Taylor's a virgin?  I was with my brother once.  I bet he is.  Mormon.  That's.  I'm willing to attach the show to the story.  Whoa.  You're going to go with it.  Yeah, we might have to alert the press.  You're willing to do that?  20 G's if a girl could prove that she had sex with this guy. 
[01:34:30]  Whoa.  20 G's.  20 large.  Two stacks of high society.  You know what?  25 sounds better.  $25,000.  Quarter of a tenth of a million dollars.  If a girl could prove she even had sex with this guy.  If I go have sex with him, can I get the 25 grand?  No, it had to happen already, Sam.  Fuck.  And you're not a girl.  Damn it.  Did he say he was a virgin?  Something's not right here.  $25,000.  If one lousy girl could come forward and prove that she had sex with Teo. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, let's attach ourselves to the story.  Yeah, we are doing that.  And we might get some cheap publicity out of it.  But I'm telling you, there's something not right still.  I don't know if I'm buying the gay angle, though.  I'm not saying.  But I think he's a virgin.  Yeah.  At the very least.  I think he's an idiot.  He's an idiot virgin.  You think he's an idiot virgin?  I think you're both right.  Because I think if he wasn't.  Not one girl has come forward saying anything about this guy.  You think one girl. 
[01:35:30]  There's a lot of fucking.  He'd be embarrassed.  But you think one girl would go, oh, God, man.  Yeah, no.  He's an animal.  But if he was fucking, then he would have wanted to fuck some more.  But if he was a virgin.  Then this would make sense for a relationship.  You wouldn't have missed it as much.  Yeah.  Once you lose it, you're like, you know what it is.  And it's attainable.  And you go, I'm going to go get that.  What's the.  Why is it important if he is a virgin or not?  That's like the thing.  Why is that important?  Because he's misrepresenting himself in some way here. 
[01:36:00]  Something doesn't make sense.  So it's like they went with the gay thing.  He says, far from it.  Far from it.  And then we have heard from people that went to school in Notre Dame basically saying, you know,  they've seen him, you know, flirting with women in bars and stuff.  So what's going on here?  Does he have a penis that doesn't work?  Does he have a micro penis?  Is he a virgin because of his religion?  Something is still not right here. 
[01:36:30]  I bet he's got a nice thick one, but he is a virgin.  I think any of that is peripheral.  I think whether he's a virgin or not, if he's been with a chick, if he flirts with girls,  whatever, is peripheral to this story.  I don't really see anything like dastardly or cover up in this story anymore.  Right.  I'm seeing it as an idiot and his friends goofing on him.  I don't think it's peripheral because he was satisfied, if you're believing him completely,  to have a girlfriend online that he's never going to see or have a physical moment with. 
[01:37:00]  Again, I've got to go back to the Bobo angle, you know, Bobo.  But he's a star athlete at Notre Dame.  Bobo?  That would lead to a lot of pussy.  So for whatever reason, you're like, you know what, all this pussy around me that I could  have tonight, I'm not going to do any of this because I got my internet girlfriend that I've  never seen.  Right.  Or saw once, supposedly.  Yeah, I know.  I know the facts.  The willingness.  Never saw again and was even a mere couple hours away and wouldn't go and see her. 
[01:37:30]  Uh-huh.  Dude, man, I had a long-distance relationship my first two years of college.  The summers killed me.  And as soon as I was able to visit her and jump on a bus or that first day back at college,  it was the greatest.  Did you get weepy?  Fuck yeah.  I told you, though, there's some love letters out there.  Oh.  But I've got to figure out where she is these days.  And I beg her to just send me the letters.  Oh.  So I could look like a complete fool.  That would be great.  Post those fuckers.  I'm sure I was writing down fucking lyrics that meant something to me. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, me now.  Oh, oh.  But man, when I knew I was close to, you know, close by, of course I visited.  And this guy isn't visiting.  It's just.  Yeah, I think the willingness to be in the online relationship and not be physical.  Yeah.  It can be attributed to that he's probably a virgin.  But the fact that he was fell for all this bullshit, that's more because he's a moron.  Yeah, we know the moron. 
[01:38:30]  Blithering dolt.  Just hearing him talk, you can see that he's a little.  Yeah.  Something's not right.  It's very, very stupid.  Yeah.  I mean, you're Skyping with something and they go, I don't know what's going on.  I could see you, but you can't see me.  That sucks.  You could tell a couple of times in the interview, Katie Couric was like biting her tongue because  she wanted to be like, how stupid are you?  Well, that's why her show is going to fail.  Because she should have just been like, if this is true, Manti, you're an idiot.  She had the big interview and she kind of failed.  She should have laid into him.  She should have laid into him.  But rumor has it they have the same people representing him. 
[01:39:00]  And so this is the way to get Teo to explain himself without getting killed by a real interviewer.  That's going to hammer him.  Rumor has it.  There is a rumor.  I, you know, I hear it's better than rumors, but we'll keep it like that.  The Sports Illustrated reporter who wrote your cover story has made some of the transcript  of your interview available.  He asked you, quote, how did you meet her?  And you responded, we met just she knew my cousin. 
[01:39:30]  Later, you told him you met at a USC game your sophomore year, that you were just friends  then.  Can you see why people would view this as at worst as a complete lie and at best as incredibly  misleading?  I can see that.  And for that, you know, for people feeling that they're misled, you know, that I'm sorry  for.  But I wasn't as forthcoming about it.  But I didn't lie.  You know, I never was asked, did you see her in person? 
[01:40:00]  And so through the embarrassment and, you know, the fear of what people may think that  I was committed to this person who I didn't have the chance to meet and she all of a sudden  died.  Now that that scared me.  And so to avoid any further conversation, I kind of wasn't as forthcoming as I should  have been.  Aren't you splitting hairs a little bit here, man, Ty?  Didn't you actually say things that weren't true? 
[01:40:30]  Why does she have such a weak voice?  Splitting hairs.  She's always been the little perky.  It's a little weak.  Self-spoken thing.  And a lot of people are checking in on Twitter saying, you know, Notre Dame girls are far from  giving up the snatch.  Really?  Well, it's Catholic.  Yeah, it's a Catholic university, right?  Catholic girls, man.  They would do it for the football guy.  Catholic girls start much too late, but sooner or later it comes down to fate.  I might as well be the one is all I'm saying.  They at least give up the asshole.  Saving the snance for when they're married. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  You might have heard I run with the dangerous crowd.  We ain't.  Do we have those clips where they're virgins but they give up the asshole?  Remember those fucking PSAs?  I remember those.  What was it called?  You remember Iraq?  Something virgins.  Can you find those and let us know when you have them?  It'll pump up these Tao clips.  What was it called?  Something virgins. 
[01:41:30]  I don't know.  They had a workaround.  Yes.  They could still be.  Technical virgins.  A technical virgins.  Very good.  Noodles Nebula.  Can I hear one technical virgin, PSA?  Were these a goof or were they real?  Total goof.  There's two of them.  There's one about anal sex and one about vibrators.  Okay, let's hear the anal sex one.  All right.  I've got big plans for my future.  A good college.  A career.  Maybe even my own business someday.  But one thing I'm not planning on is getting pregnant. 
[01:42:00]  That's why I choose anal sex.  I mean, sure, it hurts a little.  And I wind up walking funny for a day or two.  But I think my future's worth it.  Anal sex.  The smart choice for your future.  All right.  Of course it's fake.  But I haven't heard it in a while.  It's fucking great.  Of course it is.  The way she goes, anal sex.  Like, yeah.  Get into it.  Back to tail.  True.  And isn't that, in essence, lying? 
[01:42:30]  I think the biggest lie that I'm sorry for is the lie that I told my dad.  When I told dad, when he asked me, hey, did you see her?  And I said, no.  I mean, yes.  I saw her.  And, you know, as a child, your biggest thing is to always get the approval of your parents.  And for me, I was so invested in, you know, Lene and getting to know her that, you know, when dad asked me, hey, did you meet her? 
[01:43:00]  I said, yeah.  He lied to his dad.  That's not good.  Liar, liar.  Tants on anyone and anyone.  Tants on a big dumb fuck.  There you go.  You attempted a few times to talk with her through FaceTime.  And you would see, basically, what, a black box.  And she would say to you, I can see you.  Black box.  I don't know why you can't see me.  Correct.  Didn't you think that was a little weird? 
[01:43:30]  I thought it was magical.  I thought it was magical.  Are you that technologically challenged?  I am.  But someone your age shouldn't be, right?  I saw a black screen.  And she said, I can see you.  And I can see me.  He was staring into the toaster oven.  I don't see you.  I don't see you.  But I can't see you.  I don't know.  I wasn't paying attention, I guess.  Hey, wasn't paying attention?  What is going on here?  This is the girl of his dreams, his love of his life, the inspirational and everything. 
[01:44:00]  And he wasn't paying attention to the fact that he wanted to see her finally on camera.  He's finally going to see her.  And he's just like, I don't know.  It's a black screen.  I'd be ripping wires.  How do we hook this up?  I need to jerk off.  Show me your tits.  When you get an idiot to fall in love with you, they will look past a lot.  He's stupid.  Yeah.  You know what?  I mean, they will ignore details.  He is an idiot.  Because he's a moron, and the emotion of love just floods his brain, and it was already 
[01:44:30]  so weak.  Right.  How's he able to play football so well?  This guy isn't a moron, a dummy, a kook.  Mongo.  He's stupid.  Well, he's a linebacker, certainly.  Yeah, that's all he needs.  A hit, hit guy.  Run!  Run, run!  This is him discussing how he didn't talk to girls on campus, or meet them.  I'm sure you're a BMOC, big man on campus. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, HNIC.  I'm sure you're a D-U-M-M-Y.  Very popular.  I hope so.  You go to Notre Dame.  I'm imagining there are a lot of nice young women who go to school there.  Why wouldn't you want a real girlfriend who you could actually spend real time with in  person?  Good question, Katie.  Good question.  Yeah.  Well, comment?  Anti?  The Lene person, there are so many similarities.  She was Polynesian, supposedly. 
[01:45:30]  She was Samoan.  I'm Samoan.  She lived through faith, and she knew a lot about, you know, I'm Mormon, and she knew a  lot about that.  I found a lot of peace.  You're no more man than anyone else.  A lot of comfort in being able to talk to somebody, and they knew my standards, they knew my culture,  they knew what is expected of me, and I knew what's expected of her.  So he's like, fuck the real chick.  I don't need no real chick, because this chick understands me. 
[01:46:00]  You can have all the religion you want in your brain, but when you see a nice pair of tits,  that goes out the window.  Are you kidding?  He's a dope, but he's a lying dope.  You're willing to burn in hell for eternity when you see a fucking pair of tits.  Right?  This is fucked up.  I mean, all kidding aside, the Mormons, they save it for when they're married?  I don't know.  I think they do.  Yeah, that whole religion thing with the Mormons, they don't like when you do any of that premarital  coitus. 
[01:46:30]  And here's the gay question.  One of the theories, many theories, Mantine making the rounds, is somehow you created  this whole scenario to cover up your sexual orientation.  Are you gay?  No.  Far from it.  Far from that.  See, how he says that, that means he's been in some pussies.  Well, the implication is there.  You're right.  No, it could just mean heavy petting.  Ah. 
[01:47:00]  A dry humped one time.  Far from it.  But not one.  I only put the cock halfway in my mouth.  But not one girl coming forward saying, look, man, I dated him and.  Yeah.  He's all man or something.  Especially this day and age when these girls want their attention.  This day and age.  Fucking prejudice against Salmoans.  Sam, $25,000.  $25,000 is on the table.  $25,000.  $25,000?  $25,000 large?  I don't think he's ever fucked a woman.  It's an easy $25,000 for a girl out there.  Yeah. 
[01:47:30]  Prove that you had sex with Teo.  I bet like he's met girls before and they knew who he was.  But then he started talking and they're like, like in their heads, are you really this stupid?  Like, they probably felt like it was abused to have sex with him.  $250 clams?  $250 clams?  $100 being a clam?  $25,000?  $25,000.  You want in on this?  $25,000 bananas?  $25,000.  I don't want in on this.  No fucking way.  Why?  I don't want some whore to come forward and go, yeah, pay me, motherfucker. 
[01:48:00]  I did the 100 Gs with Chloe.  I saved that money.  Yeah.  I didn't have to pay up on that one.  $25,000.  A little lower this time.  A little scared.  $25,000.  Yes.  It's on the table.  Easy money.  I hope the media is listening.  We are the media, Sam.  The media.  The media.  The media.  The media.  Yeah, we're all in agreement.  He's a moron and he's stupid and he's dumb.  But there's still...  I'm offering a million dollars to the woman that comes forward and says she strapped a dildo 
[01:48:30]  on and fucked him in his asshole and took a video of it and has the video.  And then you watch the video.  A million bucks.  Wow.  There you go.  I'm in.  You just trumped my offer.  That's not nice.  There's one piece of the puzzle still fucking...  I don't know.  It's under the couch or something.  We've got to find that one fucking puzzle.  Yeah, it's something.  We've got most of the puzzle done here.  Yeah, yeah.  And it spells out moron. 
[01:49:00]  But there's one or two pieces still missing.  Yeah.  Check under the fridge.  You think it's under the fridge?  It's somewhere, but something is still a little amiss here.  This puzzle's hard.  It's two pieces.  Puzzle.  He's extremely gullible.  It's a piece of paper ripped in half.  I can't put it together.  The flat side doesn't go with the jaggedy side.  He's moronic.  He's gullible.  He's a dummy.  He's a dummy.  He's stupid.  He's stupid, but there's some puzzle piece still missing, man. 
[01:49:30]  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Maybe it's a chromosome.  Yeah, I don't know what it is, though.  A little taste?  You want more of this?  Manti talks about not going to the hospital after she was in the hospital.  All right.  Yeah, that's a big question we had.  Did we really say yes to vanilla ice?  Yes, you did.  Fuck.  It's Friday.  I want to hear...  You can ask him.  I hope you get him upset.  I love getting vanilla ice.  What is that going to do?  It'd be so funny to watch him get mad.  What's he doing these days? 
[01:50:00]  I don't know.  He's got a show on the Do-It-Yourself Network.  What?  Or he's fixing a house room by room.  Is that where Scorch is?  Isn't Scorch on the Do-It-Yourself Network?  He's part of the...  Vanilla Ice is coming up on BD...  I'm part of the lineup.  BFD.  Balky's on that channel, too.  Balky?  From Perfect Strangers.  I think of him more as Craig from Langoliers.  Oh.  We'll take you inside a little bit.  Okay.  Me and Ant say yes to these guests.  And we forget about it.  Yeah, that'd be cool.  And then the day comes, and we're like... 
[01:50:30]  Like, oh, we're kind of having fun.  Like, this is going well, and now we've got to fucking stop everything to make believe  we care about what he's doing now.  You guys were in a goofy mood, and you're like, Vanilla Ice, that'd be fun.  Yeah.  Tell him we're sick.  Have we used that one lately?  Well, he's coming in the building to do other shows.  I just pull the curtains and unplug the on-air light.  My favorite guest bookings are the ones where Jimmy's very excited about them, 
[01:51:00]  and so we have the guy come in because little Jimmy gets excited, and it's adorable.  And then Jimmy leaves and goes to L.A.  And we're saddled with somebody we really don't want to talk to.  The only reason we took him was because of Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.  And then Jimmy has something that comes up.  It's like, this guy sat in with Black Sabbath once in 1975.  And we're just staring at each other.  And we're like, I die.  The guy that cared isn't here.  Guy.  So, this guy played the villain in the Avengers. 
[01:51:30]  Right.  Yeah, I, uh...  All right, Tao talks about not going to the hospital after she was in the hospital.  Right.  This imaginary, uh, Lene.  Lene.  But then you get a call from someone saying she'd been in a terrible accident.  Who called and what was said?  Her brother Noah called and just said,  Bro, just letting you know that, you know, Lene had just gone into a bad car accident.  She was hit by a drunk driver.  Oh, this was the car accident.  So, then you traveled to San Diego?  Yes. 
[01:52:00]  And L.A. on your way to Hawaii?  Yes.  Why in the world wouldn't you go visit this girl in the hospital?  This young woman who you claim is the love of your life.  Mm-hmm.  Why wouldn't you go see her?  We actually planned to meet each other in San Diego, throughout my layover in San Diego.  And this was before the accident happened.  And so, I get the phone call that she was just in the accident.  And that was on April 28th.  Two weeks later, I get to go home.  And so, I end up in San Diego, which was too far for me to go to the hospital. 
[01:52:30]  What?  Then I fly to L.A.  And the layover time was too short.  It's like a two-hour drive from San Diego.  Man, Ty, that just really doesn't make sense to me.  Right?  It doesn't make sense to me either at this point.  So, you regret not making an effort to go see this girl you say you're in love with at the hospital after she's in a very serious car accident? 
[01:53:00]  It was a conversation that I didn't want to have with my parents.  To say, Mom and Dad, I missed my flight.  I'm not going to come on my flight because I'm going to go see L.A. in the hospital.  Don't you think they would have understood?  He's coming up with this on the spot.  Yeah, he's stupid.  Because he said he doesn't understand either.  And I didn't.  What is he talking about?  I think that when Katie said, that's only a two-hour drive.  From San Diego, Tela?  That was news to him.  Is that the San Diego to L.A. trip? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, in his little walnut brain.  Was he flying from San Diego to L.A.?  I guess so.  In that tiny little brontosaurus brain of his, I think that he was like, I meet you in San Diego.  And she was like, well, I'm in the hospital now.  You know it, San Diego?  Oh.  And then that was it.  Well, we were meeting.  You're very far away.  Yeah.  No, it's two hours drive.  Two-hour drive?  Yeah.  You're in the city called hospital? 
[01:54:00]  City hospital.  Oh, very far.  Taxi cab.  Hospital California, please.  That is Margo.  Hospital California.  This is Margo.  Yeah.  What an idiot.  And the taxi driver goes, there is no...  Confused.  I gotta go home.  Take me to Hawaii.  Drive to Hawaii.  My first time doesn't work.  Man, there's going to be an NFL team out there that's going to get a good deal with this guy.  Oh, yeah.  Discount.  I'm making $10,000 to play football. 
[01:54:30]  That's good.  Then continues.  She came out of her coma when she was on the phone with you.  What did you hear on the other end of the line?  She was just breathing in.  A yawn.  Then she started to kind of whisper my name.  She came out of the coma on the phone and this guy believes that, too.  She's awake!  Put phone by ear.  I will talk her out of coma. 
[01:55:00]  I come.  The name.  The name.  The name.  This guy's a fucking moron.  Man-tie.  Yeah, it's man-tie.  Yeah, it's man-tie.  You wake up?  What, you dream?  What, you dream?  You awake now.  You awake.  You better?  How you feel?  Lele better now.  Fuck.  I jumped for joy.  I was like, see, they were right. 
[01:55:30]  I do help her.  After she came out of the coma, she was diagnosed with leukemia.  Correct.  Well, either you're the most naive person on the planet or this is the saddest story, I think, ever written.  I mean, at this point, did you think to yourself, man-tie, what?  Are you kidding?  Now she has leukemia?  I mean, it goes on and on and on.  I say to this little guy, I say, Lou, she's my girl.  You said, oh, no.  Now you have leukemia?  Japanese man, leukemia.  I thought that. 
[01:56:00]  You know, I thought this is, how could all this happen to one person?  And I had my doubts.  But there was one day where I was at my friend's house, and his mom is a cancer survivor.  And so I told her, hey, auntie, you know, my girlfriend just found out she has leukemia.  And his mom, being the mom that she is, she said, hey, let me talk to her.  And at the end, she gave me the phone back.  She was like, you tell that girl if she needs anything.  You tell her to call me.  I know exactly what she's going through. 
[01:56:30]  I went through the same thing.  And so I'm just like, okay.  Here was the phone call.  I was doubting that she has cancer.  Now, auntie, who's a cancer survivor, knows exactly what she's going through.  Here's the phone call between the mother that was a cancer survivor and the woman.  The woman goes, yeah, is Manti there?  Yeah.  All right, look, this is just one of his friends.  I'm fucking with him.  So, like, make believe I'm the cancer girl.  Okay?  Yeah, okay.  And then she hangs up.  Manti, you tell her if she needs anything. 
[01:57:00]  She's just happy that they're goofing on this big dummy.  Yeah.  Oh, this fucking sloth.  You caught cancer in your coma?  She caught her cancer.  Yeah.  I tapped out.  From laying in bed.  They gave her cancer.  I tapped out.  Yeah.  You can't even deal anymore.  I can't deal.  Now you just don't even care.  No, because he's so stupid.  I still think there's a missing puzzle piece, but he's so fucking dumb. 
[01:57:30]  There's something going on here, but he is a blithering fool.  He's incredibly gullible.  And stupid.  Yes.  Very dumb.  Was he isolated growing up?  What kind of upbringing does this guy have?  Oh, I was raised at the base of a volcano.  His Samoan family was there for him.  Samoan.  Samoan.  Samoan.  Samoan.  Samoan. 
[01:58:00]  We got the voicemails of the fake girl.  Now, is this the guy?  Do we want to continue?  You should at least play the voicemails.  We got to hear the voicemails.  Now, I'm hearing this is the guy, or now I'm hearing it's a cousin of the guy that was  pulling the joke.  Right.  And it really is a girl.  Oh?  Because I heard it does sound like a girl.  Yeah, everyone's saying it sounds like a girl.  I'll be honest.  So he got other guys involved with this gullible idiot.  Here's the voicemails. 
[01:58:30]  You provided us with some voicemail messages.  Let's listen to one.  Not the good ones, obviously.  That Linnae left on what she said was her first day of chemo.  Hi, I'm just letting you know what you've got here.  And I'm getting ready for my first session.  And I just want to call you.  Keep your coat.  Sorry.  I could be a guy.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck mainstream media.  So, no.  No, it doesn't.  Hi.  There's something a little weird in there.  It sounds like tranny-ish. 
[01:59:00]  I just talked with you.  It's my first day of chemo.  You got chemo.  Chemo.  It has that in it.  That chemo.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like that gay voice.  Nope.  Sorry.  The gay voice.  I'd be suspicious.  Yeah, yeah.  I would be, too.  I miss you.  I love you.  Bye.  I miss you.  I miss you.  It does.  It's a girl, doesn't it?  Oh, God.  Son of a girl, doesn't it?  Sounds like a girl, right?  Right, right, right?  You believe that, right?  Because I'm not gay.  Not by a long shot. 
[01:59:30]  Boys talk like this.  Girls talk like this.  That must be girl.  Because girl, she talk high like this.  Not like this.  No.  That man.  Manti talk like this.  Katie Couric talk like this.  See?  Manti's smart.  Manti.  Manti know what girls sound like.  Manti.  He know girls sound different than boys. 
[02:00:00]  He he he he he he.  Breaking news.  Oh, what do you got?  Breaking fucking...  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Did you lose some money?  Well, breaking news.  He's disappointed, breaking news.  No, I'm still offering $25,000 to any girl that could come forward and prove that they  had sex with Teo.  Breaking news, though.  How many girls come forward?  Jim Chandler has tweeted.  What?  Oh, all right.  Jim Chandler has tweeted the Opster. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, shit.  My old pal.  Wow.  Starred radio with him when we were both 18 years old.  Well, well, well, well.  Trying to get his attention.  And I swear this isn't a homo thing.  He has tweeted.  Much, much, Opie radio.  Much love.  L-U-V.  Right.  My new girlfriend, Jim Chandler.  He a girl.  He a girl.  He writes, glad to be part of the show again.  Let's reminisce.  And I think he's got an old picture of the Opster from College Radio.  Oh, no way.  And he put it on his fucking website. 
[02:01:00]  On the station website.  It's that thing.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Where is the Opster?  I don't know.  Oh, I see.  Oh, first of all.  Oh.  It's Greg Opie Hughes in the picture.  I used to be Greg Opie Hughes on the radio.  Okay.  Someone said go with either Greg Hughes or Opie.  There he is.  Oh, shit.  Can you blow that?  Oh, yeah.  How the fuck does he have these old pictures?  Hey, there you are.  Oh, my.  Who are these people?  Who are these people?  Is it like all the people that did college radio? 
[02:01:30]  Man, maybe.  Dude, I swear to God, I have no idea what this is.  Do you think all these people have that picture and they go, you know who that is?  You know who I went to?  I know that's Kevin O'Neal.  That's the guy I was telling you about in the bathroom yesterday.  That's Greg Opie Hughes right there in the upper left.  Kevin O'Neal to my right in this picture was 15, 16 when he started his radio career  with that ridiculous fucking voice I was telling you about.  I know that's Kevin.  Damn.  Go to that picture again.  It's here. 
[02:02:00]  Where's a picture of man?  Oh, you're getting a...  What...  What...  Wow.  This must be everyone that was doing college radio.  What does it say on the bottom?  Oh, it doesn't say...  It's just everyone's names.  Was this in a yearbook?  I don't even...  Oh.  I recognize a couple of faces that I haven't seen in a long fucking time.  It's very yearbookish.  It's just the only thing I...  The reason that makes me think it's a forgery is because it seems like it might have been  more than 10 or 15 years ago.  That's true, Sam.  Based on styles and...  Yeah, I think it's photoshopped.  Are we looking at a...  Are we looking at a black and white picture? 
[02:02:30]  Are we...  Yeah, it's in black and white.  I mean...  Are we looking at black and...  Look, man.  It's an Instagram filter.  It's an Instagram filter.  What happened?  It's obviously taken on film.  Holy fuck.  I guess...  I guess the whole college radio station got together for a group picture.  Uh-huh.  Man, I don't remember this being taken.  Wow.  It's so fucking weird.  Now I'm just depressed.  This bit has backfired.  Now I'm just depressed.  It's a black and white picture. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  I can't be more than 18, 19 in that picture.  The genuine wood paneling behind you.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't even know where that was taken.  I have no recollection of where that was taken.  Geneseo?  Well, certainly Geneseo.  But where, though?  This is way too inside.  Man.  Kevin O'Neill's next...  Kevin O'Neill...  Damn.  ...is next to me, like you said.  Where is...  Where's he?  I don't see him.  I was looking for his name.  Who, Jim?  Yeah.  Did he go by something else? 
[02:03:30]  Um...  Yes, he did.  Uh-oh.  Did he start with an H?  Is there any Jims in the picture?  He was always Jim.  Jim Hayes?  Jim Hayes.  Where's Jim Hayes?  Second row.  Jim Hayes.  One of these.  Now we're stopping the show for nonsense.  I'm sorry.  Jim.  What happened?  All right.  Well, Jim Chandler has tweeted.  That's good news. 
[02:04:00]  Nice.  There it is.  We're moving forward.  The bridge is almost complete.  Wow.  Very cool.  That picture just blew me away.  I'm sorry.  It completely took me out.  It's pretty cool.  That's like really a long fucking time ago.  All kidding aside, obviously, black and white picture from Geneseo.  Oh my God, please.  All right.  Back to the voicemails.  Oh, right.  Let's hear more of this man imitating a woman.  Yes.  Girl.  Emotional one that she left accusing you.  She was angry at you. 
[02:04:30]  She's accusing you of having someone else in your room.  Let's listen to that.  I don't know who answered your phone.  I don't care.  This is my last time trying.  I don't care.  You need to play what you want.  Thank you.  So that horse shit was going on? 
[02:05:00]  Jesus Christ.  She's all worried because he wasn't answering his phone or something?  Yeah.  That girl picked up his phone.  Oh.  Why are you quite full, girl?  Well, they were fucking with him pretty good, huh?  Did it sound like this?  Or did it sound like this?  Man talk, girl talk.  He's a dummy.  Was that an unusually emotional voicemail?  Or what had happened that upset her so much?  She said that when she called one time, that a girl picked up the phone. 
[02:05:30]  And I told her, well, that's impossible.  Oh, why?  I was in my room.  Why is that impossible?  That's impossible because Manti is gay.  Oh, no.  Wait a minute.  No, I'm not.  No.  Why wouldn't Katie jump in there and go, why is that impossible?  Katie trick Manti.  Katie play trick.  Manti don't like Katie.  Manti kill Katie.  I was in my room, and every time I sleep, I lock my door. 
[02:06:00]  Finally, we have a message from the day.  Yeah, just in case some icky girl is all drunk and shit and tries to break into your room.  Manti woke up one night.  There was a girl in front of him.  I knew this because she said, hi, Manti, with girl voice.  And then I see something, something Manti never see before.  It looked like she was stabbed by knife.  She had wound that was not bleeding. 
[02:06:30]  She put it in Manti's face.  Manti go, ew, get away.  Now Manti put up sign that say, Manti sleeping, you go.  No girl allowed.  No girl.  She said she was released from the hospital, which was September 11th, 2012.  Let's listen to that.  Hey, babe, I'm just calling to say good night.  I love you.  I know that you've probably been homework lawyer with the boys or grubbing me on a Friday. 
[02:07:00]  But I just want to say I love you and good night, and I'll be okay tonight.  I'll be my best.  Yeah, so get dressed, and I will talk to you tomorrow.  I love you so much.  Say, peace.  That's a guy.  That's a guy, first of all.  It sounds like he's using some kind of voice thing.  You think?  Yeah, kind of gravelly.  But that could be just from the chemo.  True.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, boy.  You have no idea who the voice on the other end of the phone was for all those months. 
[02:07:30]  Do you think Raniya could have been playing the role of Linnea?  Do you think that might have been a man on the other end of the phone?  Well, it didn't sound like a man.  No.  You hear a high voice.  It sounded like a woman.  It sounded like a woman.  But if he somehow made that voice, that's incredible. 
[02:08:00]  It's not.  That's incredible.  He's amazed.  That's incredible.  Now there's amazement.  I love the pause, too, where Katie goes, do you think that was him on the phone doing the voice?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Man on the phone.  Oh.  It's not incredible.  No.  It's not incredible.  You could be tricked by that, certainly, but it's not incredible.  Now he's easily amazed.  That voice, girl voice. 
[02:08:30]  Katie.  Bet I have boy voice.  You talk magic now.  What do you mean?  You mean another end of magic talking machine?  You want to continue?  Ah, why not?  Really?  A little bit more.  I'm fascinated with the voicemails.  Well, those are done.  Oh, damn it.  Now he talks about finding out she was alive after being dead.  Oh, boy.  You alive?  Maybe I don't care.  You think the guy that was scamming is like, he's never going to buy this, but fuck it. 
[02:09:00]  Let's just see.  Let's see how far it goes.  And he just keeps buying everything.  All right.  The guy throws at him?  You know what this is?  All right.  So, well, if you need the password to my Twitter, here it is.  That's exactly it.  Yeah, the dude who's done that?  Oh, yeah.  Why would anyone need his password?  He's giving it out a couple times.  He's giving it out to girls because the girls say, I want to look and make sure you're not  cheating on me.  So they get the password and Bobo goes, all right, look, I'm not cheating on you. 
[02:09:30]  I'll prove it.  Here's my password.  And then they go on and say, I'm Bobo.  I like, you know, sucking man dick.  And then they change my brother and things like that.  Right.  And then they change the password on him.  He goes, no, I got a big old code.  Somebody hacked me a code to write.  I'm not as in with the Bobo stuff because I know.  And if you guys want to fuck with him, it's fine.  Obviously, who am I?  Because I know he's got issues for real. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  He does.  The tail guy, officially, he doesn't have any issues.  That's why this is.  I'm thinking now.  Healthy as a horse.  Yeah.  Strong as bull and just as smart.  Oh, Christ.  All right.  Well, you want more?  Here we go.  At 1047 California time, she passed away, they said.  Then on December 6th, Linnae suddenly reappears.  Wow.  They're laughing at him.  Yeah, they're laughing.  She like Jesus.  Because the guy pranking him was probably like, his whole thing was, well, he's 
[02:10:30]  pranking him until he calls us on it, and then it'll be over.  And then like, dude.  He just has to keep pushing it further and further.  Yeah.  He's still fucking buying this.  Let's make her come back from the dead.  Right.  This'll be great.  Wow.  Manti was very happy she was alive.  Manti, though, very scared she might be zombie.  Manti was sad.  Now, Manti happy.  Happy.  Manti be very sad if Manti have to cave her head in because she's zombie.  Manti visit you? 
[02:11:00]  Oh, you fall.  Okay.  Don't get another coma.  How cancer?  You better now?  Manti happy.  Happy.  Manti go to drugstore, get you cancer medicine.  What were you told?  So I answered the phone, and I thought it was her sister.  So I started talking, and she said, I have to tell you something.  She gave me a whole background of, you know, our family's connected with this, and, you 
[02:11:30]  know, we started doing this, and so.  But she was saying she was being chased by drug dealers or something.  Yeah, by drug dealers.  But did she say?  Oh, my God.  They brought in that story.  And she just said, I was like, okay, so.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's going on?  Back up.  She said, hi, this is Lene.  No, she said, first she said, it's me.  And I played dumb.  I was like, I know it's me.  When are you going to stop?  Yeah, exactly.  You can come out of character now.  You can't play dumb if you are dumb.  You don't go to trick Manti. 
[02:12:00]  I meant I play dumb.  But since I am dumb, I play dumb, I stop breathing.  So I just stop playing dumb to stay alive.  I played dumb.  I was like, I know it's you.  Her sister's name was Ui.  I said, I know it's you, Ui.  What?  She's like, no, it's me.  Manti, it's me.  And I said, okay, Ui.  Papa, Ui.  I know it's you.  She said, no, Manti, it's Lene.  When she said, it's Lene. 
[02:12:30]  Hello?  What did you do?  There was a long, silent pause.  Scratch my head.  I just go.  I was angry, just to say the least.  But you knew something was up at that point.  Yes.  Finally.  Yes, me not stupid.  You knew something was up.  Yes.  Of course, Katie.  I have brain on shoulder.  We know.  How many times do you think Katie looked at him and just thought to her,  are you fucking stupid? 
[02:13:00]  Right?  Like, how fucking dumb are you?  She did a shitty job.  That's what everyone's thinking.  She did a shitty job.  She really did.  She could have just laid into him.  I think she felt sorry for him.  But it's not even really laying into him.  You know, the follow-up questions suck.  Right, Katie?  She should be doing an ex-boy day.  The audience is laughing at him.  It's how colleges are offering full scholarships to people with the mental capacities of four-year-olds.  Well, Katie, then my sister called me Bobo, and the name's stuck.  That's what she's doing right now. 
[02:13:30]  Menti told you, Katie.  He's a schnoodle.  He's a schnoodle.  Menti has schnoodle named Mr. Maloonigan.  All right.  All right.  Notre Dame has a Bobo.  I don't know, man.  Yeah, that's a...  I mean, you want to...  There's more, but there's...  I mean, how much more do we need to play to prove that this guy is a fucking dolt?  What an ignoramus. 
[02:14:00]  He is.  I mean, he is really stupid, huh?  Yep.  Menti just pawn in Game of Life.  You think Menti ever punched a horse in the mouth?  Yeah.  He fucking knocked a horse out.  Hmm.  You're missing out on all the pictures.  Telegram for Menti.  Telegram for Menti.  Candygram.  The only two clips we're not playing.  He talks about lying about the girl being dead.  Yeah.  And Menti's dad says Menti isn't lying. 
[02:14:30]  So I think we could stop here.  He's not lying.  Yeah.  Don't you think?  Yeah.  And you're missing out on the Jim Chandler pictures.  He's posting a whole bunch of pictures from...  What?  Really?  ...from back in Geneseo.  Oh.  If you keep hitting that next button, he's got...  Supposedly, he's got a picture of my car.  What?  I don't know if this is my car.  Is this?  The Hughes Mobile?  It's a Honda.  Oh, I see.  I remember me and...  I crashed that Honda, baby.  I remember me and Scott Searles.  We lived on the lake, and we had to get a car to get us to the fraternity house, not even 
[02:15:00]  to class.  And we bought a lemon.  We bought a lemon.  Just to get from point A to point A.  Yeah, and it was a shitty, shitty car that broke down, and so we stopped going to class.  Oh.  Because we had to now hitchhike into Geneseo.  Hitchhiking's very dangerous.  Yeah, of course.  But it was the early 90s.  What?  It starts with a close-up of the caption that says, Greg O.B. Hughes. 
[02:15:30]  Holy fuck.  I think he's got a picture of my old girlfriend.  What?  Jim Chandler's been fucking stalking me my whole life.  Wow.  Really?  He has pictures that I don't have.  They look color photography.  All right.  We're into color.  Oh, my God.  It's pretty grainy.  Yeah.  What is that, though?  That's me looking at who?  Looking at the ladies.  Oakster's putting up numbers.  I'm putting up numbers.  Good.  Nice.  Then he's got just me.  I might be high there.  Why's he got all these pictures of you? 
[02:16:00]  I don't know, but that's J.C. DeLass.  That's pretty good.  I have some great J.C. DeLass stories that we have told over the years.  My buddy, Buzzy, burned down his house.  Remember the bacon incident?  Oh, right.  Yes.  Smoked out his entire house.  Didn't burn down the house, but we almost died.  And supposedly that's my ride.  It's an old Honda?  Hmm.  I had a Honda Accord, but I don't remember.  That's my college girlfriend right there.  Which one?  I think.  Which one?  Could you flip that?  Left or right?  The one on the right?  Yeah.  I think that's my college. 
[02:16:30]  Oh.  Not too shabby.  Wait.  Is it, though?  I can't even.  What is, um...  What's with the hair and earrings?  That doesn't really fit the 90s, Opie.  Not at all.  No.  Um...  I think that's my...  I can't tell.  Yeah, I think that's my college girlfriend.  That's fucked up.  That's the one that I...  Don't you want me, baby?  That was the Hold Me Now, brud.  Oh, that was Hold Me Now?  Yeah, and the love letters.  Oh, fuck.  In your living home. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, there he is.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  What is going on there, Opie?  That looks like a nice little dinner.  That's Jim Chandler.  Serving up the eggs?  No, serving up the fucking mac and cheese.  Oh, mac and cheese.  Yeah, this was a big dinner we put together.  It was mac and cheese.  Jesus.  Mac and cheese.  And that's Jim Chandler right there?  Yeah, he's being silly, scooping up the mac and cheese.  And there's me with a horrendous jean jacket.  Can I ask why are you wearing a tie? 
[02:17:30]  We must have had some kind of an event.  You think?  Or was that just the style back then?  No, no, no, no.  The thin tie?  Beat the fuck out of me all you want, but I didn't wear ties.  I thought it was the thin tie was the style back then.  It looks a little styled.  Everybody else is wearing casual.  We, uh, I don't know.  We had something.  Maybe a Christmas party or something.  I was trying to look.  Were you sure it wasn't a Knack concert?  You know, it is the 90s.  Holy fuck, man.  What else has he got?  Is that it?  That's it, yeah.  Oh, all right.  That has nothing to do with my fucking pictures. 
[02:18:00]  Is that the guy that tried to come in and rape you, maybe?  Right.  That's a black guy with a fucking ghetto butt and just underpants on.  Very tight undies.  How about Jim Chandler explains that this is the end of the OP pictures?  Explain that.  And now he can go into his sick fetish of black man butts.  Keep me out of that shit.  What is it?  Jim Chandler, 1075?  Yeah.  If you want to see some very old pictures from Geneseo.  Man, I remember my college girlfriend looking a little different than that. 
[02:18:30]  Better or worse?  Not about the same.  Yeah?  But almost cute.  She has that cute look of the 90s.  90s?  Oh, well.  Yeah, that was definitely her.  Yeah, she's gone underground.  She's got five kids, probably.  I think four.  Wow.  I looked her up about 10 years ago.  Reliving the glory days.  My whole life fell apart.  I looked up an old fucking college blade and see where she was up. 
[02:19:00]  Why do guys do that?  I did do that about 10 years ago.  Guys will do that.  Yeah, she's the one I wrote love letters to.  The only time, I think.  She's got them somewhere.  With this very song being quoted.  Yes, yes.  She went underground, though.  She's not on Facebook or nothing.  Opie's sitting at his desk.  He's got his pen and paper.  Here we go.  Here it is.  Hold me now.  Hold my heart.  I don't even understand why you would quote this song 10 years after it came out.  A classic. 
[02:19:30]  Opie was always into a classic rock.  So, yeah, that's it.  Man, that's weird.  Yeah, I mean, I think we all look up old flames and shit.  During our tumultuous periods in our life, I think we try to harken back to simpler times.  With Facebook and stuff, you're like, oh, I remember that person I used to date.  I want to see what she's been up to.  Yeah.  In more of an innocent way.  But she went underground.  I haven't seen anything from her.  I think she's changed her hairstyle.  I hope so. 
[02:20:00]  Sort of a mullet.  I hope so.  Yeah.  Wow.  Just stick your dick between those lips right there.  Did you put your wee-wee right there?  Did your wee-wee go in there?  Did it?  I bet it did.  Greg Hughes has appeared.  I am keeping my mouth shut.  Yeah, but she didn't.  Exactly.  I'm remembering her fondly right now.  As a sweet, innocent girl.  I'm remembering her fondly. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  Taking that.  That takes me back to a very innocent time.  Aw.  Well, no girl's that innocent when she wears cock rings on her ears.  Those are nice.  Nice little earrings she's got there.  That was the first girl I ever fell in love with, right there.  Oh, man.  That was it.  And, you know, I didn't really fall in love with any girls in high school, really.  Gee.  That was the first one right there.  She got you, huh?  And not many in between.  In real life or just on the internet, Beckham?  Can I ask you a question?  I'm not going to answer, maybe.  Oh.  Was she hand out the window?  Huh? 
[02:21:00]  Was she hand out the window?  Oh, my God.  That's hand out the window?  Yeah.  What a shame.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm sure she took care of that since then.  Well, you never know.  I'm not going to hand out the window.  Oh, it's a pH problem.  Oh, that's terrible.  It's all coming together today because of stupid Jim Chandler.  Now I got problems.  Now you're against Jim Chandler.  What the fuck, man?  And how does he have...  I don't have a picture of my old fucking college flamer. 
[02:21:30]  How does he have a picture of her?  That's creepy, isn't it?  You've moved onwards and upwards since college.  Oh, look at her.  You know, he's holding on to the past?  A little bit.  That just ruined everything.  He said, I can smell your cunt.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Yeah.  Just waving those fingers out the window.  Oh, my God.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had.  And I've had him all over the world.  Let's say hi to Pat in Connecticut.  Pat.  Pat.  Pat.  Pat.  I worked out with your old girlfriend's houses. 
[02:22:00]  She was...  Yeah.  Is she blonde here?  Is that the girl you're talking about right now?  Blonde?  Well, I was fond of blondes, certainly.  What town?  She lives in Fairfield, Connecticut right now.  But she dated you in college.  Oh.  Whoa.  Wow.  Look at that.  You know what?  No.  No.  She lying?  Yeah.  Why am I lying?  She lying?  She thinks we dated.  It was probably, you know... 
[02:22:30]  Like I said, the Opester put up numbers back then.  Put up numbers.  Whoa.  I don't remember any blonde that I actually dated.  What was her name?  First name.  Uh, Joanne.  I swear to God, I don't have any recollection of ever dating a Joanne.  Joanne.  Sorry, Joanne.  Your heart's been broken.  Joanne, you were a fucking throwaway.  A one-night little fucking stick-in from the Opester.  So, obviously, she made it more than it was.  Just another number.  How did that conversation...  I officially went out with two girls from Geneseo, and both were named Chris. 
[02:23:00]  How did the conversation come up that she had dated Greg Opius?  Um, through the one that built her house.  The builder that built her house.  I guess they knew.  We probably knew each other.  Maybe we had a little something.  But to this day, she's bragging to construction workers.  That's bullshit.  No, no, no.  She doesn't brag about it at all.  Well, obviously, she did.  What's that?  Obviously, she told someone.  Wow, yeah.  There's no way. 
[02:23:30]  I only had two official girlfriends in college.  Both named Chris.  Okay.  There was the good Chris and the bad Chris, according to my mom.  Oh, really?  My mom liked that Chris.  Didn't like the other Chris.  Well, perhaps this Chris didn't get close enough to your mom to realize there was an issue.  Yeah.  Jesus.  When I traded out Chris's, my mom was not happy.  Really?  Nope.  Maybe your mom didn't have to drive all the way back to Geneseo or wherever in the cold with the window open.  Right.  Hands sticking out the window. 
[02:24:00]  Out of that old Honda.  Greg, why is your hand all chapped and dry?  Yeah.  What happened?  Oh, well, mom, I had it out the window.  So this is the car?  I drove it.  Is that the car that you had the hand out the window?  I have no recollection that I drove that Honda in particular.  So Opie had his hand out this window.  Because of this girl.  Because of that girl.  I love when you could put a face to the stench.  And it was this Opie.  Right.  That's the Opie.  This dude.  That's the Opie.  That's not Opie.  That's the Opie. 
[02:24:30]  Just wiping his stench fingers on that tie.  Right.  With Jim Chandler.  See, I told you I knew him.  Serving up the mac and cheese.  That's right.  That Chandler knew how to throw a blast.  Look at him.  Checker tablecloth.  We might have to get the word out to Jim Chandler that it's time for a phone call to reminisce.  Could be.  Because he's got some pictures that I've forgotten all about.  Is that ginger ale you're all drinking?  Looks like it.  But why would it be beer?  Party time.  Oh, I think they were like.  Straight edge? 
[02:25:00]  The radio people were kind of straight edge.  Faggots?  Yeah, I think so.  Who's that dork on the right?  He was actually really cool.  I forgot his name.  He was pretty good at radio, too.  He put glasses on.  I mean, he looks like the nerd from Midnight Madness.  He was actually pretty cool.  He's certainly not coming across in that picture, but.  And you got, what is that, three holes?  Three future holes at the table?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  They were all doing radio.  Oh, she is like.  This one is already chunky in college.  She's ready for it right there.  That's Terry Clifford.  Yeah.  That is a Terry Clifford. 
[02:25:30]  I think this is way too inside for people.  Oh.  Ah, what the fuck.  Well.  And I think that's the place me and Jim lived with a few other guys.  It's sort of recognizable, that kitchen.  You guys lived together?  Yeah, we did.  Macaroni together?  Wow.  Yeah, man.  Jim was, I liked Jim a lot.  He was all right.  We went to war together.  We played golf together.  We lost touch, unfortunately, until a few weeks ago.  When he started his cycling class?  We're getting this shit back together, Jim Chandler.  He's doing the cycling. 
[02:26:00]  I knew him as Jim Crow.  Oh, no one.  Jim Crow?  Yeah.  Yeah, he went with Jim Crow, and then maybe another name or two in there.  Yeah?  Yeah, he was trying out all sorts of radio names.  I just went with my stupid nickname.  Opie.  Opie.  From when I was 12.  That's all right.  It's not like it's going to stick.  Oh.  That's right.  Oh.  You know, I was good with the Opie thing until I was about 30.  Then you started going like, hey, wait a minute.  And that has certainly passed me by a few years ago.  Oh.  A bunch of years ago.  A lot of years ago. 
[02:26:30]  I'm not okay with Opie anymore.  I'm kind of stuck with it.  Oh.  This guy just jacking off in a bathroom.  You know, I know that girl's number still.  What?  You have it memorized?  Yep.  It was stinky?  Yep.  Yeah?  Yep.  I could write a number down to say, this is it.  You just have to believe me.  I believe you.  Back in those days.  Seven, five.  Three, oh. 
[02:27:00]  Nine.  I also know my college number was 716-245-7447.  Positive.  People are going to call that number today.  And I haven't thought of that number in a long fucking time.  But I am positive that was my college number.  My childhood phone number is 865-6217.  Yeah, yeah.  234-5420 with Central Iceland.  Why do you remember those things?  I don't know.  And then someone will give me a number two weeks ago that's really important. 
[02:27:30]  I don't remember that.  No.  But my college girlfriend's phone number, I absolutely still remember.  Actually, that's her parents' number, the one I would remember.  You had to remember the numbers because there was nowhere else to fucking put them.  They had to stay in your head.  Right.  But why is it still in my head?  I don't know.  It was fucked up.  No for real, no real reason.  No.  I remember all kinds of things.  They're great things to use as, well, not those.  You could try them if you want, but it ain't going to work.  Not those.  But they're great things to use as passwords.  Ah!  Because you just remember them, and they're so random. 
[02:28:00]  Holy fuck, that's great.  Yeah, yeah.  They're so random.  They're very hard to crack.  Throw a little something else in the middle of a number, you're good.  Yeah, you throw something else in the middle, a word or something.  It's fucking classic.  Wow, that's great.  Yeah.  Yeah, I did that with a few things like old license plates for my old cars.  See, I never remember license plates.  If you asked me my license plate right now, I couldn't tell you.  I couldn't either.  Not now.  I just couldn't tell you.  But I remember this girl's number?  That's stupid.  Maybe a lot of years ago. 
[02:28:30]  The human brain is stupid.  It really is dumb.  That's ridiculous.  People go, what's your license plate?  If I have a problem with my car or something, I'm like, ah, fuck.  Now I have to go down to the garage where I live and look at it.  Didn't I say that, Joe?  864-621-7.  He's got it too, right?  I saw that.  Yeah.  Gotta get vanity plates.  Yeah, that's true.  He always remembers.  Joe's just talking about how he uses certain numbers.  He does the same thing.  Oh my God.  Uh-oh, what's that?  Can we turn this into homecoming day? 
[02:29:00]  Please.  Fuck, Kevin.  What now?  This is Kevin O'Neill.  Oh, shit.  Kevin, punch him up on the fucking picture so we can put a face with it.  Kevin, I was talking to Anthony about you yesterday.  I said you started radio basically when you were like 14, 15.  He said you had one of those good fucking boss jock voices.  Yeah, you had the voice that I was jealous of.  Well, thank you, O'Neill.  Well, I lost my...  I got out of it.  Yeah, he got out of it.  He was the first guy that got bitter as far as radio goes. 
[02:29:30]  Nice.  And now finally I'm there.  I'm there.  Yeah, I was the guy who said, there's no money in radio.  I'm getting out of it.  There you go.  Yeah, he was a protege, man.  Kevin O'Neill, we all looked up to.  He was already working in professional radio as we're in Geneseo doing college radio.  Dude, that's crazy.  If you call working radio in a small country town professional radio, yeah.  No, you were on that big AM station in Rochester.  For a while, yeah. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  Wow, that must have been badass though back then.  Wait, which picture did you take?  Because there's another...  There's a group picture, I guess, from everyone from WGSU in Geneseo, and you're standing right  next to me in the back row.  So which picture are you talking about?  The picture I'm talking about is the one in the basement apartment there at that wonderful  dinner.  What was the dinner for?  Because I'm wearing a tie.  We just used to get together for dinners once in a while, that whole group of people.  I hope he gussied up for it.  Every once in a while, you used to wear a tie? 
[02:30:30]  I don't know.  There you go.  So you took that picture?  So you weren't in it, huh?  No, I wasn't in it.  Why isn't anyone drinking?  Because I know we certainly drank together.  Yeah, definitely.  But I mean, I don't know.  It was just a regular dinner during the week.  Maybe we didn't drink during the week.  Kind of faggots were you.  I know.  Maybe it was a Sunday or something stupid.  But is that ginger ale and mac and cheese we're eating and drinking? 
[02:31:00]  It was ginger ale, mac and cheese.  We didn't even bother putting it in the serving dish just out of the hand there, if I recall.  And the salad, I think, consisted of torn up lettuce, and that was it.  Yeah, and we didn't have that bag of lettuce yet.  It was torn up lettuce and whatever cheap dressing you could get at the store.  That's funny, man.  How you been?  Good, good.  Yeah, how's Buffalo?  Buffalo's cold as hell right now.  You stayed there for the past fucking, like, 10 years? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, Kevin's been in Buffalo for a long time.  Longer than that.  Really?  Shut up, man.  How long have you been in Buffalo?  I've been in Buffalo as long as...  Back when you were here on radio in Buffalo, I was here then.  What year was that?  I was 89, 90 in Buffalo.  And I've been here since 87, so...  Holy smoke.  Oh, fuck.  How old are your kids now?  Oh, my God.  My oldest daughter is in college.  She's 20.  Jesus.  My son is 17. 
[02:32:00]  He's still a senior in high school.  My youngest daughter is 13.  Holy mackerel, Opie.  My kids are two and a half and four months.  See, Opie put his career first.  My kids are two and a half and four months.  He's got kids in college.  I'm supposed to have college kids.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  Time flies.  Maybe your kids will keep you young, hopefully.  Holy fuck.  Oh, my God. 
[02:32:30]  That's hilarious.  A guy that I was very close to in college.  Look, we're standing right next to each other.  He's got a 20...  How old is your daughter?  My daughter's 20.  20.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Having kids right out of fucking college.  Jesus Christ, man.  Well, no.  No, I had my first kid when I was 30, so...  That wasn't out of college.  Whoops.  Oh, fuck.  And I don't know.  Do you remember?  You were at my wedding party. 
[02:33:00]  Yes, I was.  Damn.  I've got those pictures as well.  Oh, can I set them in?  Damn.  I'll have to do that.  I think I still have them.  In the picture there of us having dinner down in the basement apartment, one of those people  is my future wife, and, well, she's not my wife anymore, but...  You tell that.  Wait, you're...  No.  How many times have you been married?  Just once.  Oh, so you're single now?  Yep.  All right.  Single for, like, 10 years. 
[02:33:30]  Gotcha.  Wait, which one were you...  See, I...  I don't know.  I vaguely remember the people in the picture.  I obviously remember Jim.  I could say I was...  I eventually married the one with the big hair, but I think they all had big hair.  Yeah, they certainly did.  What are you doing for a living now?  I work as a manager in healthcare.  There you go.  Oh.  Very cool.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I got out of...  I mean, and it's the funny thing.  Over the years, anytime I talk to people on the phone and business or anything, they're 
[02:34:00]  like, oh, you've got a perfect voice for radio.  You really...  He had it.  Where did it go wrong?  Well, as far as radio.  Just realizing that, you know, I worked in small-time markets and stuff, and, you know,  the job stability just wasn't there, and the money wasn't there, and, you know, I think  I started in high school in radio and then got into college and just lost that...  You know, I graduated and was like, I don't want to do this.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  Put him on the station, O.  Come on.  What do you say?  We give him a Saturday show.  There's just so many times that you can read the weather and try to sound interested about  farm implement commercials.  How about Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, you come on from 10 to 11 on our station?  Oh, that's perfect.  I think that's taken.  Sam?  What?  Comment?  That's perfect.  Fucking Kevin O'Neill.  Holy shit.  That's so cool.  Damn.  Hey, Kevin, leave your...  Hold on.  I want to get your phone number.  Ooh. 
[02:35:00]  All right?  Sounds good.  We have to break because we got Vanilla Ice coming in today.  See the excitement?  See the radio excitement?  Huh?  He's way more important than I am.  No, not at all.  And I'm not even fucking making a joke.  Who gives a fuck about Vanilla Ice?  Oh, come on.  Vanilla Ice does.  All right, Kevin, hold on the line, all right?  Yeah.  Kevin O'Neill.  Wow.  He took the picture of the big mac and cheese dinner.  Extravaganza.  Bunch of dorks eating mac and cheese. 
[02:35:30]  Drinking ginger ale.  With tie.  With tie for no reason.  Tie and denim jacket on.  Christ.  Classic.  So I wore the tie just for the mac and cheese dinner?  Yes.  You could tell, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because nobody else is wearing a tie.  You wore the denim jacket with it.  You're going to stand out.  You're going to make a fucking impression there at that mac and cheese dinner.  But then, like, I remember how to play it both ways.  So then it would be like, I got to be with these guys that aren't big partiers and they're  like career oriented. 
[02:36:00]  I'm sort of career oriented.  Then I would get rid of the tie and throw on like a fraternity sweatshirt.  Whoa.  To go to the frat house and then play it that way.  You're insane.  No.  It was the complete opposite of that is what I'm saying.  Searching for an identity.  Those guys are all about, like, searching for an identity.  There you go.  Searching for an identity.  Taking acid and burning Bibles in the middle of the street.  Oh, my God.  Just trying to figure out where the Oapsters corner of the world was.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Yeah, let's take a break.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  I have to do that.  All right.  All right. 
[02:36:30]  The Oap and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the Oap and Anthony Show.  Stop.  Collaborate and listen.  Ice is back.  I got a brand new invention.  Something.  Grab your head on me tightly.  Flow like a heartburn.  Daily and nightly.  Will it ever stop though?  I don't know.  I'll turn off the lights.  And I'll go into the extreme.  I'll rock a mic like a bitch.  I'll rock a mic like a bitch. 
[02:37:00]  Are you a righty or a lefty there, sir?  I'm cool. 
[02:37:30]  I'm gay, so I'm bi.  I'm both.  What happened?  I walked in at the right time.  I'm in the wrong time.  I'm sorry, Ice.  What's up, brother?  I'm in the wrong.  Sorry, Ice.  How are you, man?  I'm not gay.  I'm just like, you know.  Y'all getting a little friendly up here.  I don't know where I can step into.  I've been here.  I've been here.  What up, Ice?  See, I got my icy watch today.  No, you didn't hear me.  I said we're going to the bullpen for this interview, and we're bringing a hoot kid in to help out.  Not that we need the help, but I thought it would be kind of nice.  It's kind of cool.  Yeah, thanks, man.  And we got Vanilla Ice in the studio.  And someone just told me you remember being on our show back in the day. 
[02:38:00]  Back in the day, man.  I mean, I had a weekend that lasted a few years, but I remember that one.  Did we give you a little of this?  No.  Why didn't you?  Oh, really?  We had a guy that was getting a lot of the guests.  Not anymore, but back then, it would have been great.  All right.  Yeah, no.  We had a guy that would bring a lot of you guys to the stairwell and give you a little taste.  Yeah.  I didn't get that flavor.  A little taste of the reefer.  You got some bad?  Yeah.  No, no.  Now it's piss tests everywhere, but what are you going to do?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  That's right.  You don't use molly. 
[02:38:30]  There's all this molly stuff going on.  Yeah, what's that?  Yeah, what is a molly?  It's ecstasy.  Oh, that's what they just call molly's?  Mollies, yeah.  Mollies.  Maybe you're teaching me something.  Is this a New York thing?  What is this?  I don't know.  It's like cocaine and heroin mixed, right?  Mollies?  It's ecstasy.  Oh, man.  I've been away from the game too long, man.  I saw it on Twitter.  People all of a sudden talking about molly and molly's.  Rappers love ecstasy now.  Literally yesterday, I learned about molly's.  We know you guys ain't on any of that, because you wouldn't be up this early in the morning  if you were.  It's all coffee now. 
[02:39:00]  It's all caffeine.  That's right.  What have you been up to?  Vanilla?  Working hard, man.  Working hard, brother.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Get in where you fit in.  Make it happen.  Get in where you fit in.  That's it, bro.  What is the Vanilla Ice Project?  The greatest show on television ever.  Yeah?  Whoa.  Yeah.  We're on season three right now, because everybody needs to be uplifted about the housing market  in America.  It's all been bad news.  And we're here to spread the good news, man, is that it ain't all bad.  Really?  You live the American dream.  That's right.  Then why do I have two houses in my family in foreclosure? 
[02:39:30]  Because you need to renovate them and change that backsplash and stop fishing.  My dad, before he died, took out a ridiculous mortgage.  I ain't touching that one.  I'm going to let the bank grab that one.  Hey, Obama fixed it for you.  It's called refi, Bubba.  All right.  Get up in there.  Get in where you fit in.  Yeah, we got a few foreclosures in my family.  Yeah?  Well, then maybe that's the next Ice My House Project.  Yeah?  You want to take one?  Let's come over there, man.  We got one.  The whole wall is falling in.  We'll heat it up, man.  We'll fix it up.  And the bank still isn't touching it. 
[02:40:00]  It's like, what is it going to take for you guys to just take this house back?  You want them to take it.  Yes.  It's been years.  No one has paid a mortgage on it in years.  I'm sure there's a lot of listeners who'd be like, I'll take it.  True.  True.  If you're giving homes away, I mean, I guess I did come in at the right time.  Hell yeah.  You're making money in real estate.  Yeah, lots.  It's good.  Got some tips for us?  I got lots of tips.  Yeah, you're making money in the real estate.  How much you got?  That's Anthony, of course.  Oi.  Oh, good, man.  Nice.  Yeah, making money in real estate.  Is that it?  Absolutely.  He's talking about the Vanilla Ice Project. 
[02:40:30]  Better than ever right now.  Really?  Yeah, absolutely.  Season three of this show.  And what...  Wow.  I don't know.  That's kind of a different industry from music to real estate.  That didn't happen overnight like that.  I didn't think so.  Yeah, yeah.  I could see you on a real estate card.  15 years I've been doing it on a real estate card.  I haven't yet to get my card, but that's a good idea.  Thanks for that.  That's funny.  I think he's doing...  Can I get your card?  Are you building the houses like Jimmy Carter?  I'm still confused about this show.  I build the homes and everything.  You do?  Yeah, I found another passion, yes.  Wow.  I use my own money. 
[02:41:00]  I do it all.  And I've gone up to the mansions now and everything, but I've been doing it 18 years and had great  success with it.  Now I've got my own TV show.  Like you're swinging a hammer and shit?  Yeah, I get in there and mix it up, man.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not afraid.  Yeah.  Wait.  Explain this show.  I'm still confused.  This show showcases all the new state-of-the-art and home features and everything.  And I took season three.  Right.  It airs this Sunday.  Okay.  This house was set in for seven years.  You know, 10,000 square foot mansion set in seven years.  You know, a lot of them seen them in the neighborhoods, especially in Florida.  You've got a beautiful neighborhood and then you've got this one eyesore. 
[02:41:30]  And everybody's like, why don't somebody buy that?  You know, foreclosure, short sale.  You hear these terms.  This was a tax lien.  So I learned the strategy of how to actually acquire these homes way below the appraised value,  which gives you a lot of room to put whatever you want into it.  Someone's in a bad spot.  You're taking advantage of the situation.  Vanilla Ice.  Come to the projects.  Hey.  I can't say it enough.  Come to the door.  All right.  Get the fuck out.  Get the fuck out.  Get out.  We've got to be a team of corporate attorneys. 
[02:42:00]  You know.  Either way, same process.  You must enjoy a good tax show.  You're not in the house.  There's no way to kick out of the house.  It's a foreclosure.  You found your niche.  I like it.  You found, like, what you're supposed to be doing in life.  I found a way to make it happen, man.  You know.  So are you flipping houses?  Yeah.  I flip house.  I've been doing that for a while.  There's a lot of money in flipping houses.  There sure is.  It's better than ever.  I mean, you can't buy a house cheaper than you can build it right now.  So it's, you know, it's the way to do it.  So you buy a house and then you do a couple things and then you sell that shit. 
[02:42:30]  Well, we do a lot more than a couple things.  The other thing is we don't just put carpet and, you know, paint and flip it.  Those days are gone.  Those days were good.  They were high-teching these houses out.  We're high-teching them out.  We're making a smart house, man.  In what way?  I love that shit.  Well, in season two, I put in a lazy river.  It takes you down through a vast landscaping of two acres and it goes underneath a bridge  through a cave.  Got fiber optic lights in the cave and really cool stuff.  You sit there with your raft and you marinate, man.  You get your pina colada and you cruise around.  I like the sound of that.  But what's cool, he teaches, like, millionaires how to upgrade their houses cheaply. 
[02:43:00]  So instead of, I guess, when they come in and they give you, like, a high price because  they know you're rich, he'll give you the cheaper price.  Well, we give you both prices.  It's your option.  In Florida, you know, a lot of people don't even care what it costs.  They just want the high-tech stuff.  So we got this smart house going right now.  See, I'm in the middle of, like, starting to get this shit in my house.  That's it.  I'm getting all kinds of...  Like what?  Well, I'm upgrading my whole security system to include, like, where on my phone, everything. 
[02:43:30]  Door locks, air conditioning and heating, lighting.  That's right.  Everything is going to be, like, automated.  Automated on your smartphone.  I love it.  And then all my cameras, you know, pan-to-zoom with infrared, you know, so I can see at night.  That's right.  Anywhere in the world.  All this good shit.  Yes.  And I can punch it right up on my phone.  Say, who the fuck is at my house?  That's right.  It's like a white...  Turn those fucking lights off.  Shut the door.  I'm paying the bills here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's true, though.  Who's getting bummed out?  That's the way of the future, man. 
[02:44:00]  This is like...  Okay, you're not going to be able to get into any of these houses anymore.  I know, man.  God damn, man.  How bummed are you?  That's the thing, man.  Stay out.  Give a nigga a break.  Who can't do this?  Give me a shot.  Give me a chance at this shit.  Oh, man.  Vanilla Ice, you're coming over after this show, and you're going to take a look at my place  and tell me what to do.  What do you need?  For free, by the way.  Give me some ice knowledge.  That's great.  That's like everybody wants this.  It's available now.  It's something that's not really...  Like, you don't have to be completely super rich and crazy to have this shit. 
[02:44:30]  And I got to say...  That's right.  Prices have come down.  I got to say, it's brilliant, because you take your piece of shit house, and you make  it just cool.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Cool shit.  Instead of having some new construction somewhere where they got all those features, Ice comes  in and goes, no, I'll give you the lazy rep for looking it up.  That's it, man.  I mean, we ride the whole house, too, you know?  All the smart stuff.  We've got electric drapes.  We've got a pneumatic elevator.  You've got everything.  You never have to look for another remote control.  You know how you have, like, five different remotes?  You're going to put the DVR on, the DVD, and you're like, which one is it?  You know, never anymore.  You throw all those remotes away, it's your phone. 
[02:45:00]  Your smart phone.  Everything's your phone.  Everything.  You punch that up, you've got your whole remote right there.  Thermostat.  Dude, that's my home theater.  That's it.  I want to do this.  I want to put everything on my phone.  We'll hook you up.  That's crazy.  That way, when you lose your phone, you're completely fucked.  That's like, oh, shit.  Is there a backup?  Is there a backup in case you lose your phone?  Yeah, I cloud them.  Yeah, it's on the cloud, man.  Get your ass another phone.  That's it.  Because that's your front door key.  That's your heat.  That's everything, man.  Why aren't you aging, man? 
[02:45:30]  Someone's going to say it.  What the fuck's happening with this guy?  Ice, man.  Is it the ice?  Ice does look fucking...  Vegetarian, man.  Seven years.  You actually look clean and everything, man.  So you're one of them pain-in-the-ass people to go out to eat with?  Well, to be honest with you, I didn't have a choice.  I envy people who can eat whatever they want, and their cholesterol stays the same.  But I ended up with the bad blood, man.  Really?  I was in the family.  I had 380 cholesterol.  I said, Doc, what do I do?  He says, you can take Crestor or Lipitor and eat whatever you want.  And I checked it out, and it says that it kills your liver in the long run. 
[02:46:00]  It will save you from a heart attack in the short run.  It kills you from being a liver.  My grandmother was telling me, my liver is only working at like 30%.  I said, I'm going to need that later.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know?  And what do I do, Doc?  He says, go change your eating habits.  And I did, and it brought it down to 133.  Wow.  And you work out and shit?  Yeah, totally.  All the time, yeah.  That's pretty goddamn stuff.  Still doing music?  Still doing music, man.  Yeah.  What kind?  Because the last time we saw you, you were doing the hardcore metal stuff.  Yeah, with Ross Robinson, Korn, and all them guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Still hip-hop, Korn, I get in where I fit in, man.  I just, you know, I don't really have any kind of set thing. 
[02:46:30]  I'm getting hype right now, Iceman.  I'm sorry, man.  Yeah.  That's it, man.  That's what I do.  I bring that energy, man.  That's what's up.  Is he really?  He's our first solo white artist.  No kidding.  Wasn't Beastie Boys, like, the first white group, and you were the first white?  Rap, the crossover, the pop radio, first pop rap song ever.  He was my Jesus Christ.  Let's not forget it.  Former.  Oh, yeah, of course, man.  Oh, my God.  Snow.  Snow.  That was later.  That was later.  Yeah, that was later.  That was later, and that was the first white reggae artist, right? 
[02:47:00]  It wasn't really hip-hop, though.  Do you consider that really hip-hop?  No, that was mostly reggae, though.  Yeah, it was kind of a reggae twist.  It was like reggae, hip-hop thing.  Definitely reggae, though.  Almost reggaeton.  It was good, though.  It was good.  I still don't understand one damn word he said.  No.  But I still hum it.  In pharma.  Right?  So now when you go to somebody's house, do they immediately recognize you?  And they're like, oh, damn, man, that's ice.  Yeah, of course. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, I shake a hand and make a friend, man.  It doesn't bother me.  And then they're like, god damn, now he's all informed about this.  Were you always into the housing thing?  No, man.  I just stumbled upon it.  When I was young, I did Ice Ice Baby when I was 16, man.  Wow.  You were 16 when that came out?  16.  160 million records.  Remember, dun-da-da-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  A little different.  No, no, it was dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  It changed here in the middle of that lawsuit.  David Bowie was like, fuck that shit. 
[02:48:00]  That's smart, man.  It changed in the middle of the lawsuit.  We're not going to lie to you, man.  We've had fun with that clip over the years.  Oh, yeah, bro.  You're trying to explain that.  That is a great clip, man.  No, no, that one goes dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  The one goes dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  It's a little bit.  Next, you're dun.  Yes!  The one when I went up.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  It's hilarious.  Don't forget about this.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  People weren't sampling as much back then, I guess, huh?  Well, it was around.  It's just nobody really sold any records.  You know what I'm saying?  So they left you alone. 
[02:48:30]  And it was weird that it was looked at like, oh, what's he doing?  Now, of course you sample shit.  But back then, it was like, oh, you're ripping off that song.  It's like, no, man.  I remember after my record was out, I mean, there was like no real sample clearances.  There was no organization, no company, nothing.  Now there's like, right across the street here, Avenue of America, there's a huge building,  sample clearances, you know?  Really?  And, I mean, sampling was done way before I came along with it.  Well, that's my question.  I want a history lesson.  What was the first sample that everyone knows?  First samples?  Does anyone know?  EPMD, maybe?  I think maybe Stetsasonic might have sampled some stuff, but it was really covered up. 
[02:49:00]  But what song did they sample?  There had to be the first one.  It was usually probably Roger Troutman or Zap or something like in that era, right?  I mean, that's a lot.  A lot of rock dudes got sampled and they woke up like, uh-oh.  Niggas are making money.  We got to get that.  That's what happened, you know?  We got to get that.  But until they made, like there was some, you know, in the hip-hop community, you know,  there was a lot of successful records, but they didn't sell a lot.  So the team of the lawyers, they didn't really, you know, go after it until it really sold.  The laws were probably created after he came out. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  It's like, wait, how much money?  How many records did he sell?  Yeah, yeah.  What?  There's money there.  He's using, wait, he sounds like Queen to me.  You sold like 15 million, though, of one record, though.  You know, to date, 160 million.  God damn.  You know, Ice Ice Baby, to the extreme, sold almost 3 million copies just last year alone.  I mean, it helps with the TV show and being on the Adam Sandler movie and all these different things.  You get a taste of that?  A good taste?  I bought all my publishing back, man. 
[02:50:00]  So you get a nice taste.  I get the biggest taste.  That's how I'm able to do what I do in real estate, you know?  One song.  I don't know if you want to answer that.  Two songs.  You know, I got a song that's catching that big time.  Which one?  The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  Oh, okay.  Right.  It's so big right now, I can't even explain it to you.  Everybody knows Ice Ice Baby, but I'm telling you, the generation that's out there right now  running this world grew up to the Turtles, man.  Yep.  Right.  And they are into it.  I mean, it is huge.  They got signs.  They come dressed to my concerts like Ninja Turtles. 
[02:50:30]  They jump on stage.  What?  Oh, yeah, man.  They're buck wild.  How much has the Ice Ice Baby made you over the years?  Do you ever say?  I'm good.  Lots.  I'm good.  I'm financially good.  Ridiculous number?  Ridiculous.  Hey, I wouldn't doubt it.  But one song.  You know, it's not about money, man.  It's all about family and friends.  I can't tell you.  Listen, you ain't born with it, you're not going to buy with it.  Well, that's the thing.  If you got no family and friends to share it with, you would trade it for the family and  friends.  No, you just stay home and watch TV and you're on movie theater and screeners and you drink 
[02:51:00]  a lot.  Oh, shit.  That's me.  Wait a minute.  Oh, wait.  Oh, God.  And who wants to be like that?  Exactly.  Wow.  Man.  One.  Fuck it.  You never met David Bowie, though?  You never interacted?  Yeah, man.  Listen, I had to pay after the lawsuit.  The lawsuit worked out in my favor because I ended up buying their song.  Wow.  It was four million dollars.  It was my best investments.  I didn't know it at the time.  But you own under pressure now?  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[02:51:30]  It was cheaper than, well, it was cheaper than, you know.  What?  Wait, so you own under pressure.  How did that work out?  That's great.  Well, the same way Michael Jackson bought the Beatles.  How did that work out?  You know, people can buy publishing.  Most people don't buy the publishing because after seven years, they'll take the advance towards  their publishing for another seven years.  Uh-huh.  And then you have the option to buy it right then and there.  So you said, all right, I'll give you the four mil for under pressure.  Pick it.  And it was a great investment.  That is brilliant.  It was better than keep paying the, you know.  Because I've seen that show up in commercials and stuff. 
[02:52:00]  Everywhere.  Yeah.  And you get that every time now.  Yeah.  Damn.  So it doesn't matter.  It's all cha-ching.  Cha-ching now.  It's it.  It's changed.  How did that part go?  Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching.  Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching.  That's what it sounds like now, motherfuckers.  I love it.  Holy Jesus.  Brilliant.  I know while you're sleeping, like, the ghost of, like, the gay ghost of Queen is, like,  looking at you.  Motherfucker.  Right?  I don't know if Queen is watching you right now. 
[02:52:30]  They have plenty of songs of their own to hang on to.  So, wow, who made that?  You haven't met Queen.  The gay ghost.  Why'd they have to be the gay ghost?  I guess Freddie Mercury.  Yeah, of course.  Because Freddie Mercury.  Why do you have to bring the gay?  You know, African-Americans aren't very tolerant of gay lifestyle.  We all know that.  Why is that?  They have to be down on the DL.  No, we're cool now.  I got a gay hat on today.  Oh, yeah.  You know, he's pretty gay.  He's pretty gay.  He's pretty gay.  I'll be gay warm today.  And even Obama came out and said, you know, nobody didn't come out.  What did he come out and say? 
[02:53:00]  He didn't come out.  Drum roll.  You know, supporting gay rights and stuff?  Sure, man.  Keep banging.  But you got the biggie shirt on.  That's cool.  You know, I keep representing.  That's it.  It's like gangster and gay.  GG.  You know what I'm saying?  Double G'd out, man.  That's dope.  It's like ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  So you now officially own that.  That's great.  Officially.  And I'm not embarrassed to say I copied his dance moves.  I think every black kid copied his dance moves.  You know that, right?  Was that right?  No, every black kid copied that whole. 
[02:53:30]  You still remember him?  What?  The back and forth.  That was like, yeah, yeah.  That shit was fucking righteous.  That was hard right there.  What was ONA doing when this song was out?  What were y'all doing?  What year is that now?  91.  No, I'm trying to remember.  I'm not even being a dick.  91.  Wow.  91 already.  Doing drugs and bad mouth in your country.  I was doing radio in, where the fuck?  Buffalo, I guess.  I was working construction on Long Island.  I didn't play your record.  I was at a rock station.  You guys were, I remember, and then you came to New York shortly after. 
[02:54:00]  Wow.  And then I came in there, and then I think you had some issues, legal issues yourself.  Yeah, there were a couple things.  That happens.  I remember some stuff, too.  That happens, you know.  Yeah, we got fucking...  Made us bigger.  That's it, though.  The lawyers told us, fucking dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, your ass out the fucking door.  That's it.  You ain't buying shit.  Don't let dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun hit your ass on the way out, motherfucker.  You ain't buying shit.  I love it.  Yeah, you ain't buying your way out of this loop. 
[02:54:30]  Ah, shit, man.  You guys are too much, man.  I love it.  That's great.  What a friggin' different lifestyle, man.  Yeah, you figured it out.  I don't know, man.  That's fantastic.  Day by day.  Day by day.  You're loved doing a TV show?  Yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery, man.  Just take it day by day.  Love life.  That's it, brother.  Jesus Christ.  Don't panic.  Tomorrow hasn't happened yet.  What else about the show?  You got Lazy Rivers, and you got the smartphone stuff.  Oh, I got a panoramic gaming room with a 200-inch screen that comes all the way.  It wraps around you.  Whoa.  Okay? 
[02:55:00]  What?  And you sit on this big vibrating chair.  You put on the 3D glasses, and it's a gaming room.  That's, like, totally immersed.  I mean, it really comes to life.  It's surround sound, and it's got subwoofers, but it's got some kind of, like, vibrating thing  underneath the chair that'll actually, if you hit something, it'll kick you in the ass.  Yeah.  It'll thump you, man.  I like that whole wraparound and 3D.  Jeez, that's got to look great.  It's like you're in it.  I built the world's first IMAX home theater.  IMAX at home?  At home.  Look at me.  I'm a piece of shit with a regular fucking... 
[02:55:30]  What is that, a couple of Gs?  Yeah.  A couple of two, huh?  Yeah.  A couple of two.  Perhaps more than that.  They're saying we've got to wrap up, but we've got to, like...  Oh, man, you're busy today, huh?  All over the place.  Getting everybody to tune in for Sunday, man.  That's great.  You know what?  You and the Who Kid for the Instagram.  A lot of...  You and the Who Kid.  Hold on.  That's video.  Hold on, man.  Hold on.  I'm fucking this shit up.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Finally.  One, two, three.  You know, a lot of guys were arrested on their laurels there.  I don't know what's going on.  Goddamn, you know, just raking in that money. 
[02:56:00]  But you found a good niche for yourself, and you're doing all right.  Hey.  I like that.  You've got to find a passion and run with them.  I like seeing these true Hollywood stories where they end up tragic, you know?  Yeah.  Well, they're entertaining as well.  I mean, we all loved it.  Who didn't love...  I'm sure you guys had a fun day with it, with Britney Spears shaving her head and going  crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  You know what the thing is, is that, like, you know, I did...  I had a transitional period, like I said.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A weekend that lasted a few years.  But, you know, you've got to figure out your purpose in life and where you belong in. 
[02:56:30]  And I can't wait to watch what Bieber goes through, you know?  Yeah, right.  It's going to be some shit.  It's going to be some shit.  Why is that?  Hopefully it gets...  Because you're used to living this huge artificial life, being on stage in front of all these people  all the time, every night.  And then when it stops, you've got to get back into reality.  Man.  And that's the part where everybody loves to tune in and watch.  It's very entertaining, you know?  That's the entertaining part.  Let's watch them fall off the fucking pedestal.  Horrible for the person living it.  Great for the people watching.  Yeah, yeah.  We never got that big, so we're good.  Exactly. 
[02:57:00]  Exactly.  We were almost there a few times.  Almost, man.  Yeah, we threw ourselves off the pedestal before anyone put us there.  Yeah, yeah.  We're like, fuck this.  Yeah.  Holy shit, man.  Hey, fuck it.  What are you...  Ice.  Ice, you just go buy ice, right?  Rob.  My mom called me Rob.  Yeah, Rob.  I respond either way.  I like that.  It's pretty cold outside, because I'll take ice.  Yeah, all right.  I thought he'd be icy.  Ice.  I got my jewelry on.  Look, I want all my ice today.  Oh, man.  I'm iced out, man.  I got an ice ring on my dick.  I had no intention of watching your TV show. 
[02:57:30]  I'm going to watch that.  I had no intention, but now I'm going to check it out.  The people are his head, right?  There you go.  So now we've inspired you.  Who cares?  We'll do an interview with him.  We'll have fun.  We'll remember him from any W.  But it gives you great ideas for stuff you want to do to your house, too, man.  Yeah, man.  It's the DIY network.  Where is the DIY network?  Channel 111 on Dish Network, if you got it.  Do it yourself.  Straight up.  Do it yourself, man.  And it's Sundays at 10 p.m.  It's called the Vanilla Ice Project.  Yep.  Come back and see us, man.  I sure will, man.  I will.  Thanks for having me on the show, guys.  Great to see you.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:58:00]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  I'm in chains.  Got to say.  I'm in chains.  I like that one from Drew Boogie.  You can download that on iTunes, right?  Yes.  It's a very good one.  Let's see.  I want to say Vanilla Ice was amazing.  I liked Vanilla Ice. 
[02:58:30]  Kind of did our dumb thing before the guy comes in.  I said, who gives a fuck and all that?  You know what?  I'm all in.  I'm all in with the Vanilla Ice.  When he was talking about that lawsuit, said it changed mid-lawson.  Yeah.  He was like, oh, yeah.  How did you not love the guy?  And I remember we loved the guy when we had him at N.E.W.  And he remembers certainly his time on the show back then.  But that's 10 years ago.  Yeah.  And he hasn't aged up.  No, he really hasn't.  He actually looks younger than when we interviewed him at W.N.E.W. 10 years ago.  What the fuck?  Definitely does. 
[02:59:00]  It doesn't look like he had any of that Hollywood work done.  No.  Fuck.  Just living a good life, I guess.  Living a clean life.  Vegetarian.  Fucking not doing any of the drugs.  No, that was fun, though.  Yeah.  He's a good shit.  He's got a little fucking thing going for himself there.  Making a lot of money.  And I don't know what it is about DJ Who Kid, but I fucking love him, too.  It's hilarious, dude.  I love him.  He's out of his fucking mind.  And he's just the best.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a great personality.  Yeah.  Look at that fucking...  You know, fucking...  The niggas see that? 
[02:59:30]  They gotta get some of that shit.  Yeah.  He's just good to have in the room for, like, any circumstance.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  He could fit in anywhere, just hanging back and throwing in words.  And he loves white people.  He does love a good white person.  He loves white people.  Von DiCarlo on Twitter.  Oh.  Patrice's woman there.  Yes.  Good friends with her.  She writes, is Rob still married?  Oh.  And then she writes, Von Van Winkle. 
[03:00:00]  Sounds nice.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh.  I wish Patrice...  Oh, no.  I wish we could have a seance.  Oh.  And talk to Patrice today, because he would have a lot to say about that.  In a good way, though, man.  In a great way.  Motherfucker.  Right.  Vanilla ice.  Vanilla fucking ice.  Vanilla fucking ice.  I understand you gotta move on, but...  Yeah.  Vanilla ice.  Vanilla ice. 
[03:00:30]  I wish I could do Patrice.  Everybody used to get pissed at Who Kid for hitting on Von.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  And Von would come in, and Who Kid would be here.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  And Who Kid started hitting on her.  The fans...  Hey, don't let him move.  They're very protective.  It's nice.  They are very protective.  Yeah, well, what's she supposed to do, man?  Really?  She's gotta get hers.  She's gotta get her.  She's a young, vivacious...  No.  Gotta get hers.  Sexual girl.  Hers.  Yes, yes.  Er, dude.  Mm-hmm.  But that's hair, not her.  I know, but I just...  My her.  My her.  Rot-thir, rot-thir. 
[03:01:00]  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah, that guy.  All right, so Vanilla Ice was cool.  We're all good with him.  We're all good with Vanilla Ice.  We look forward to his next visit.  With great anticipation.  Yes.  Ninja rap.  Ninja rap.  Ninja rap.  I forgot about the ninja rap.  Fucking ninja rap.  He's making bank on that shit.  Didn't he do...  What was the other one he did?  There was a third one.  I'm in chains.  Play that funky music.  He sang...  That wasn't a big hit, though.  It should have been a big hit.  It was on radio, though. 
[03:01:30]  Is that the one that went...  Din-din-din-din-din-din-din-din?  No, that was the A side, and the B side was Ice Ice Baby.  Ice Ice Baby.  I was telling Ant during the break, here's a guy.  He made a shitload of money off Ice Ice Baby, like a fucking fortune.  Then he's getting sued for everything, where he's starting to think, oh my god, I'm gonna  now be bankrupt because of that song.  I'm gonna lose my cake.  And then he turns around, and he...  Before he runs out of money, he buys the fucking song, because it was cheaper.  Paid four million for the original song, and you gotta think he's made probably another 
[03:02:00]  fucking...  How many million, you think?  Fucking...  Tens of millions, easily.  The rights to that.  Off the one song.  Worldwide, they use that on all kinds of fucking things.  You can tell he's rich as a motherfucker.  He just looks it.  He looks very rich.  He looks very well off.  Right.  And he's doing that whole real estate thing.  Right.  He's probably buying foreclosed shit for nothing right now.  But what a smart idea, because you're kind of stuck with your house.  Yeah.  So you're like, well, fuck, alright, I got this house, I'll just pimp it out.  Pimp that shit out. 
[03:02:30]  Make it cool.  That's it.  I'm getting all that shit done.  Are you?  I'm gonna have the high-tech house of the future.  All that electronical shit in there.  They're running everything.  Timers on lights.  Not like those fucking dumb timers you dial in by the switch or anything.  Yeah.  It's all done with a master computer.  And I'm there fucking working it like a puppet master.  The heater guy just came to my building, so it looks like we won't have a problem getting  hot water out of the showers anymore. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, good.  So we're both, you know, kind of working on different stuff.  Oh, see what you did there.  We might have some water temperature consistency, so.  My water's so hot.  It is.  Oh, boy.  It's the warmest.  Nothing better than a nice, hot shower for a long time, too.  Right.  You leave it running real hot, and it's just like, I can't believe I've been in here  15 minutes.  It's still blazing hot coming out of here.  The only thing is, sometimes that's not an option.  Am I right?  Sometimes you'll turn the shower on, and it's just cold, right?  What? 
[03:03:30]  I'm so well off.  Oh, jeez.  I haven't turned off a light in four years.  Oh, my gosh.  Every light.  It gets so expensive.  It's daylight in my house all day long.  Uh, Opie, I hate to kind of burst your bubble there.  Yeah.  But I, too, do have lights on as we speak.  But in that lit-up house right now, two TVs are on for nobody.  Why?  Just, because I didn't feel like finding the remote to shut them off this morning when  I left.  What's a remote?  I don't know. 
[03:04:00]  I have so many TVs, each TV has one channel on it.  It's on.  Then you wander around.  Yeah.  Instead of changing the channels, you go to another room.  No, just go to another room.  It's cool.  That's a good idea.  I'm going to have to start doing that.  That's a good idea.  I got all my news channels.  Hundreds of televisions, you just walk around.  I actually just...  Yeah, it's been all I was doing that shit.  I'm in the channel 250 room.  Right.  Yes.  Let's see you do that.  I just traded it.  We had two DVRs in the house, and I traded one in because there's a $10 a month saving  if you'd trade in.  Oh, well, that's good, you know. 
[03:04:30]  $10 each.  The world needs ditch diggers, too, you know.  Yo, that's Vanilla Ice again!  Hey, Vanilla Ice!  Yo, Vanilla!  Yo!  There he is!  He just glock-glocked us sideways.  Why would he glock-glock us sideways?  We had a good time.  That's what he does.  He's a gangster.  You got heat in your house.  It's cold in New York.  Very cold.  Well, no, the heat's good in the sense that we don't have control over it, and since there's  old people that live in the building, we actually have to crack a window in the cold  winter.  Oh, because it gets a little too warm.  So you're one of those guys, too?  No, I mean, we don't have control over the heat. 
[03:05:00]  But yesterday, I thought, I really thought that we were going to have to turn on the  heat for the first time.  Oh, was it chilly?  No, no.  When I was going home, I'm thinking, okay.  Oh, right, right.  I think it was 14 degrees when we were going home yesterday, something like that.  It was still in the teens, I believe.  So I'm thinking, on my way home, you know what?  Today might be the day we turn on the heat for the first time.  It's supposed to be very cold.  What is it, 20?  Something like that?  Well, now it's starting to warm up a little more, but it's still cold.  It's in the 20s.  Because heat rises, and you get everybody else's.  Well, here's the punchline to my dumb story. 
[03:05:30]  I get home, not only are we not turning on the heat, we had a window open.  Jesus.  Was it a window of opportunity?  A window of opportunity?  I like when those open.  Oh, opportunity.  You need one of those.  Yeah.  Oh, Sam needs a window of opportunity to open.  I got one when I left college.  Obi's opening a giant, nice window in a house to let heat out.  You need a window of opportunity to open for you.  Yes, yes.  We had a weird show today.  It was fun.  That homecoming shit was weird for people.  Oh, no.  Was that too inside?  Dude.  I don't think so.  Everybody got to relive their homecoming through your home. 
[03:06:00]  I remember when I was listening to radio before I was in radio.  Yeah.  One of the things I really enjoyed was little insight into the people that I was listening  to, into their lives.  Right.  Whether it was something from yesterday or something from yesteryear.  It's a voyeuristic medium.  It really is.  And when you build a relationship with these people you don't really know, you feel like,  oh, this is a new little story I'm hearing.  Right.  Yeah.  Huh.  Although that Scorch shit was fucking hilarious. 
[03:06:30]  Can we save the Scorch clips for next week?  Please.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  This weekend, I am trolling Scorch's fucking website and watching.  Yeah.  I am going to watch that shit.  Save the weird news, at least.  Weird news.  The other thing is...  Yeah.  Mine went weird news.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  If you haven't seen the comments on the YouTube video, they're all saying, like, a bunch of  them saying, hey, Scorch, Sam Roberts is fucking you over again.  Oh, my God.  He doubled the viewers.  Yeah.  Don't kill the guy.  Oh.  Let him think he's...  We like Scorch.  Let him think he's Joe Biden. 
[03:07:00]  Please.  You know what's weird?  The Scorch.  The guy, Kevin O'Neill, that called in today.  Uh-huh.  We started radio...  Well, he was already doing radio when I met him, but kind of did radio in college and  stuff.  I haven't talked to that guy in 20 years, and I felt like we were still friends.  Really?  Isn't that weird?  Isn't that weird when that shit happens?  Yeah, that's fucking awesome.  Obviously, our lives have gone, you know, in all sorts of directions since the last time  I talked to him, but I feel like...  Wouldn't it be great, like...  That's strange.  ...the last time you saw each other, right?  Probably 20 years ago. 
[03:07:30]  And, like, I mean, not even, like, vaguely, the exact last time you saw each other.  Have it filmed, like, from some space camera, where you just look in ultra-fast motion of  every way you moved since then, and then, boom, and then you're back on the phone together,  and see everything that happened in between.  There's, like, so much shit going on in life.  And to add to that, my friend Jay, who I just saw in L.A. when I was up there.  Yes, Jay from Framingham.  He's got two kids and all, and we used to talk when we used to hang out a lot when we 
[03:08:00]  were up in Boston, that people have relationships, whether it's with a girl, like, just your  best friend growing up.  Someone from the neighborhood.  Someone making a joke on you through the internet.  Right.  You have relationships.  And you hang out every day, and as I tell this, people are going to think of someone  in their own heads.  Like, someone you were really, really close to.  Maybe your best friend through school.  Best friend through high school.  I got one as I'm thinking about it.  And one day, you're going to say goodbye to that person, and that's going to be the 
[03:08:30]  last time you ever see him.  That's it.  For whatever reason.  Yeah.  Not talking like some tragic death threat.  No, no, no.  Just talking like...  Well, that's obvious shit.  But I mean, where you were inseparable with this person.  But the next thing you know, one day, like, the sun's going down, and you're like, oh,  I've got to get home for dinner.  Yeah, that's it.  And you said, all right, see you later.  And for whatever reason, that was the last time, and you had no idea that was going to  be the last time.  That's it.  Strange, right?  Yeah, it's terrible.  That's life.  Well, you make new relationships, and the old ones kind of, you know, go to the waistline. 
[03:09:00]  They say people in your life are seasons.  Like Kevin O'Neill, we hung out a lot during college, and then I was in Buffalo, we hung out  a little bit there.  And one day, I don't know, maybe we had a beer or two together, and I said, all right,  see you.  And that was it.  You move on.  Until today.  You move through life.  And these relationships that go to the wayside, they enlighten you and educate you to make  new relationships, which you then use to fulfill your life in the present. 
[03:09:30]  Can I tell you what made me, if I can use your word, howl yesterday, Ovi?  Yes, please.  Anthony went on his Twitter and was talking about the inspirational messages that people  leave on his Facebook.  I fucking hate those.  And he put a screenshot.  Yeah, but it's going to just make people leave more.  He put a screenshot of somebody on his Facebook that wrote, I may not be perfect, but when  I look at my children, I know that I got something in my life perfectly right.  And just added the caption, oh, no, you didn't. 
[03:10:00]  He gets so mad.  I really do get angry.  And I saw the asshole.  Anthony, was that from Ovi's Facebook?  AIDS!  I had one today I wanted to read, but it's long gone because, man, I get a lot of fucking  mentions during the day.  Oh, yeah.  But one guy's losing his mind because I say itch instead of scratch, or I say scratch 
[03:10:30]  instead of itch.  It's like stand on line or in line.  Hey, shut up.  It both works.  I don't know who else here was getting all upset by Opie saying that.  Uh-oh.  Mars was losing his shit over that.  Mars, the guy barely speaks English.  What's the difference between itching and scratching?  Yeah.  He came in and he goes, it's scratch, not itch.  I don't know why people do this.  And then he broke out.  Mars can't speak one language.  What is the difference between none of them?  What's the difference between the two?  Itching.  And the online in line thing could be explained either way.  You scratch and itch.  Right.  Itching is how it feels, and scratching is the action.  I would say.  But I don't have a problem. 
[03:11:00]  We all have decided that it just works.  Exactly.  It's interchangeable.  We have all, as a society, said you can use both.  So you scratch and itch.  So an itch is the feeling that you want to get rid of, and then you scratch it.  Okay, I get that.  But everyone does say, not everyone, but a lot of you say, I'm itching.  Itch it.  Yeah, just itch it.  I'm itching this.  I'm itching this itch.  Unless you're Marcelino.  Ah.  Ah.  Puerto Rican engineer who can't speak Spanish or engineer anything.  I don't speak Spanish neither.  AIDS! 
[03:11:30]  And the in line, on line, once again.  Sometimes there's an imaginary line.  You're on that fucking line.  You're on line.  We all go, oh, to get over there, I gotta get on this imaginary line.  The line's imaginary, you're on it.  Or the line of people, you're in that line.  Of course, it works either way.  Yes.  I say...  Depending on how you were brought up, people use both of those.  I just say I'm queued up.  That's what you say?  I'm queued.  Nice.  It's very British of you.  Yes.  I'm European.  Yes.  I've queued up.  We've all queued up in front of this place.  And I love the people, how can you be on line? 
[03:12:00]  People did that on the iPhone 5 girl video.  People left comments going, why is he saying in line?  Oh my God.  More importantly, asshole, there's a chick there who's out of her mind talking about  an iPhone.  Yes.  I'm scared.  How about you enjoy a video without picking you in the pot.  It's actually in line, not online.  Oh, you did that yesterday when you were doing like the Spanish guy who can't help you at  a store or something like that.  You did a Spanish accent, but you did the iPhone 5 voice.  Oh, I did. 
[03:12:30]  Yes.  Everything was a question.  Question?  Oh.  Man, DJ Who Kid has no heat.  Why do you say that?  I'm getting nothing from putting him in a Vanilla Ice picture.  Well, he's got to retweet you.  Well, tell him to retweet that shit.  Let me see what kind of heat he's got.  When he tweets me, I always get people asking me to listen to their demos, to sign them to  a deal.  Every wannabe rapper starts tweeting you.  Oh, is that what happens?  He's got no heat.  Man.  Even on the Instagram, he has no fucking heat. 
[03:13:00]  Poor guy.  He's got a lot of Twitter followers.  Well, how about we get a few of those?  He's got 240,000 Twitter followers.  That's not bad.  And he's verified.  So that's really him.  I'm verified.  We got a line of the day shit?  Look at what he wrote.  This son of a bitch.  He wrote club bookings, blah, blah, blah.  Tune into Hollywood Shuffle on SiriusXM, blah, blah, blah.  And then he wrote Opie and Anthony and Howard Stern weekly.  Oh, man.  Nothing about you.  Yeah, fuck Sam. 
[03:13:30]  Nothing about you, Sam Roberts.  Well, technically, I think him popping up on my show.  It's the Opie and Anthony after show.  But he counts it.  Oh, okay.  All right, well.  And then he writes, where are you from?  Nigga, New York.  That's where he's from, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No kidding.  This liar.  Oh, man.  Are we doing line of the day today?  Oh, yeah.  If you want.  Do we have to do it officially?  No.  But before you do line of the day.  Oh, come on, man.  We're almost out of here.  Holy fuck.
