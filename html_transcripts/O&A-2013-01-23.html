<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, employing consistently vulgar and often shocking humor throughout.  The show began with discussions about the extreme cold in New York City, escalating into darkly comedic anecdotes about cold environments and even serial killer victim photos. This transitioned into a heated discussion of Beyoncé's lip-synced national anthem performance at the inauguration, mocking news coverage and comparing it to other lip-syncing incidents, including Whitney Houston and a seemingly lip-syncing Yo-Yo Ma.  The hosts also ridiculed a local news personality, Lionel, describing him as having a "giant peanut head."  The segment concluded with brief mentions of a cat attacking dogs and a birth announcement. Jim Norton was the only guest in studio during this portion.

Next, the show shifted to a discussion of workplace safety, specifically regarding subway maintenance.  This quickly segued into a promotional segment for Mike Tyson's new talk show, followed by a "Jimspirations" segment with nonsensical inspirational quotes.  The hosts then discussed 50 Cent's new book, "Formula 50," leading to criticisms of an intern ("Mr. Distraction") and reminiscing about past guests and interns.  A behind-the-scenes mishap regarding a Beyoncé montage request further fueled their criticisms of the staff.  50 Cent then joined the show for an interview, discussing his book, fitness regimen, diet (including his dislike of beets), upbringing, and views on gay marriage and menages à trois.  He also talked about his mother's early death and avoiding drugs and alcohol despite his environment.  Following the interview, the hosts expressed their dislike for a previous guest, Patty Stanger, and made jokes about 50 Cent's appearance. The segment ended with discussion of upcoming guests John Jones and Chael Sonnen,  and an advertisement for Gamefly, followed by vulgar humor about Bobby Kelly's impending fatherhood and baby registry.

The next segment featured Opie recounting a humorous video of Bobby Kelly being choked out by Jon Jones.  The conversation focused on Bobby Kelly's wife's pregnancy and childbirth, using graphic language to describe the process, including the placenta and umbilical cord.  This transitioned into a discussion of Dana White's ear surgery, detailed with graphic descriptions aided by a video.  Dr. Sani called in to explain Meniere's disease and the surgery.  A blind taste test of breast milk, almond milk, and 2% milk by Bobby Kelly added to the sexually suggestive commentary. Chael Sonnen and Jon Jones then joined the show.  They discussed Sonnen's Twitter verification process, Dana White's surgery, their professional relationship, rivalry, and experiences with Anderson Silva, Vitor Belfort, Rashad Evans, Chris Weidman, and Rampage Jackson, delving into fighting techniques and injuries.

A later segment focused on a discussion of Dos Santos vs. Cain Velasquez, including speculation about Velasquez's loss.  The conversation included vulgar language and derogatory comments about women. Jones and Sonnen (Chell) promoted their upcoming fight.  The discussion then turned to *Justified* and *Sons of Anarchy*, before returning to their April 27th fight at the Prudential Center.  The segment moved to Jim Norton's experiences with fans and comedian collaboration, and then to Bobby Kelly's baby registry.  The final, lengthy segment involved a vulgar "gay-off" challenge between the hosts and a listener named Ron, resulting in multiple participants vomiting.

The following segment featured a highly explicit in-studio event with Sal, Troy Kwan, and E-Rock, involving graphic descriptions of anal acts.  This was followed by crude discussions of bodily functions and sexually suggestive remarks.  Bobby Kelly's weight and personal life were also discussed. The "Line of the Day" segment followed, leading into Jim Norton's advice show, where he addressed listener calls on relationship issues, infidelity, addiction, and a family member arrested for child pornography.  A brief mention was made of 50 Cent, Chael Sonnen, and Jon Jones as earlier guests.

The final segment of the show included listener calls. One caller discussed his girlfriend's past with a famous comedian, another confessed to mocking Bobo on Twitter, and a third complained about his girlfriend's blowjobs. Opie offered advice in each case.  The segment ended with a sexually suggestive commercial for Steven Singer Jewelers.  No guests were in the studio for this segment.

[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  It's going to melt your mind.  So vulgar.  Shut up, you fucking degenerate hippie cocksucker.  I would take a shot in the face for a minute.  Very small cock.  So flatulent.  I've farted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, all right, you'll be an Anthony show.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking like cock and ball. 
[00:04:00]  This is good practice when I do the view.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest net ever existed.  You guys having a good time or what?  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed and convention burns the ground.  Don't do it.  I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  With Opie the Destroyer.  You're a big douchebag. 
[00:04:30]  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony the Rage.  Yeah, yeah.  Your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy in the peanut.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  This is why I can't even take fingers in my ass.  It makes me feel like I have to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful.  But I just can't take them.  This is the Opie Anthony Show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  This one's gonna hurt.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  And wang.  Ha ha.  Noises.  Ha ha.  Noises.  Ha.  All right, all our voices are working.  Time to broadcast.  Apparently.  There it is.  All right.  Breaking news.  It's winter in New York City.  Hey, hey.  Breaking news.  How about the cold?  It's pretty cold enough for you. 
[00:05:30]  Breaking news.  Cold enough for you outside, Jimmy?  I tell you what.  You know, you gotta stand out there and you gotta work, right?  The job site, don't worry.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  I'm too tired.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Oh, Jimmy's sleepy.  Oh, my God.  Ha ha.  Winter has hit New York City.  That's right.  It is fucking cold enough.  And the news is losing their fucking shit over it.  Coldest day in two to three years, everybody.  Yeah, single digits.  My God.  The big apple.  The frozen apple, if you will. 
[00:06:00]  And, of course, we talk about how stupid they are for talking about it every year, but  we'll do our break.  Yeah.  We have our go-to breaks.  I mean, if it was like 30 degrees below zero, then that's a story.  Well, yeah.  But if it's, you know, kind of what happens in January, shut the fuck up.  It's chilly.  Just say, welcome to winter.  It's chilly.  Do you ever think of how cold space is?  Like, when you think like this.  No, but like this weather's terrible, like 10 degrees.  But imagine if you put your hand out in space, how fucking cold that would be. 
[00:06:30]  I've done that.  It's like minus 300 or something.  Yeah.  That's fucking cold.  Well, just when you're flying, it says how cold it is outside of the airport, and it's  kind of creepy.  It's like minus 40.  40, right?  Minus 40, 41 degrees.  I remember seeing the last time I flew from L.A.  I like those guys that climb Everest and shit.  That's fucking like retarded cold.  And, you know, you get exposed skin, and it just fucking instantly rots away on you.  John Montone was doing a story about how it's cold.  Was he?  And he was talking to a lady waiting for her bus, and she waited and waited and waited. 
[00:07:00]  That's how the story ended.  So, how have you stayed warm this morning?  Well, I bundled up a lot, and I took some extra clothes with you, and of course my hat.  Ha, ha, ha, hat.  Back to you.  Yeah, there's no punchline here.  That's what he was doing this morning.  That's what he does.  And we love him, by the way.  That's right, Katie.  It is cold.  Right.  We get it.  He's what?  Their main reporter on 1010 Winds. 
[00:07:30]  He's the man on the street.  Man on the street guy.  Guy that gets out there.  If it's cold, he's got to do a story about how cold it is.  Yeah, live in Times Square with the chili people.  If someone's car was swallowed up by a pothole, he'll do his pothole story.  He's there.  He's there.  Yes.  Yep, yep, yep.  Yeah, well, I'm in an apartment here in New York City, and I stayed last night.  New York.  New York.  And apparently people leave notes in the elevator to management that it's fucking cold. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, you're in one of those buildings?  Yeah, it's under one of those buildings.  Why don't you get a real place?  Who the fuck knew when I got the place in the summer that the heating issue is a little off?  You've been there a while now, haven't you?  Yeah, yeah.  But if you remember, last winter wasn't really that bad.  We haven't had the single digits, like you said, in two years, since 2011.  The heat doesn't work?  It's very minimal.  Oh, my God.  Very minimal.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we kind of would, right?  I would love that.  Because we're on the opposite side of the spectrum, where everyone turns their heat on, 
[00:08:30]  so if you live up high, you're fucking happy.  I slept with the window open last night.  So did I?  Uh-huh.  Oh, wow, really?  Yes, that's how hot it is.  And guess what?  I still haven't turned my heat on yet this year.  Why don't you bring some heat over to my place?  But how fucked up is that?  I have not turned my heat on yet, and I have to sleep with the window open.  Wow.  It's so fucking hot in the apartment because, obviously, heat rises.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you're getting everyone else's fucking heat.  Well, I'm on the eighth floor, and apparently every apartment under me is freezing, too, 
[00:09:00]  because no heat is rising.  It's crazy.  No heat rises.  The good thing is, for the apartment, I only use it really to sleep there.  You know, I'm not entertaining or not walking around or anything.  Do you bring your bitches there?  Where my bitches at?  Where my bitches?  Oh, jeez.  So I take all the blankets, and I just pile them up.  Of course.  And I get under there, and I'm fine.  And even at my house, out on Long Island, I like my room freezing cold. 
[00:09:30]  Like, I turn the fucking air conditioning on, even in the winter, because I like my room  really cold, so I get under the blankets and shit like that.  Right, right.  So it's not a big issue, but if there are people that actually live in that apartment  building, you know, I'm just there crashing out.  That's horrible.  That's like my old place.  Fuck that.  When I was living in a brownstone.  Mr. Brownstone.  Yeah.  And then your fucking tootsies would get really cold going to the bathroom to shower in the  morning.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, horrible.  Yeah.  That'll happen.  Then you're standing in your bathtub, and you're getting frostbite on your feet, because 
[00:10:00]  the bathtub will not warm up in time as you're taking a hot shower.  You shower in the morning, I can't understand, it's still fucking cold, man.  Oh, I can't.  Oh, no.  I'm too greasy, man.  Really?  I can't.  I have never come in here without taking a shower.  Oh, well, I guess last week when I flew from L.A., that was probably the first time.  Were your arms tired?  They were very tired, yeah.  I never shower in the morning.  I have to.  I'm a night before guy.  Yeah, or during the day after.  Look at your skin, it's fine.  Thank you.  Mine gets all greasy and shit.  Gotta clean, wash the slime off. 
[00:10:30]  Slime.  You just lay there wide awake, and you're just like, I'm not even a little tired.  No.  Oh, it's the worst.  It's terrible.  You gotta get up.  Do you get up and walk around?  No.  You're supposed to, that supposedly resets your stupid sleeping brain.  Really?  Yeah, you gotta get up and fucking move around a little bit.  For five minutes, they say, but don't turn on the lights to keep the lights very dim.  So walk around a little bit.  Walk around in the dark.  Maybe read a little bit.  Like a psychopath.  No, you can bang your knees.  Yeah, you keep the lights dim. 
[00:11:00]  Maybe have a little milk.  I was looking at last.  Because that reminds the body that you used to suckle.  Oh my god.  It is suckle.  That's true, though.  Really?  Yes.  On a cow?  Because they can't figure out, they can't really figure out why milk puts you to sleep,  especially if it's warm.  But basically, they think your brain goes back to being a little...  Wouldn't it be nicer if you could just grab a tit, if you could roll over and suck on  a tit, and then you get all tired.  It's like, I'm sucking on a tit.  Just nurse it.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  I was looking at the photos, last photos taken by serial killers.  There was only like five or six of them.  That's why you're not sleeping.  They weren't even losing pictures.  They were photos that serial killers had taken their victims before killing them.  Joel Rifkin?  No, Rifkin wasn't, but I'm sure he's got them.  But they were chilling.  Like, there was one of a girl, like a teenager who was killed, and she had like a little short  black hair, and she was like posing in a black dress, and they said the killer had  made her cut her hair.  He had killed her boyfriend, and made her cut her hair, and then wear this dress and 
[00:12:00]  pose.  It was really weird.  Ew.  Why?  She's alive.  Wait, wait, watch that.  These are creepy.  Wait, that girl is ready to be killed?  That's the last photo ever taken of her.  By the serial killer?  Yeah, by some guy.  I forget his name.  He was a truck driver, I think.  Her boyfriend...  It's a very artsy shot.  Her body was never found.  The boyfriend's body was never found.  I don't want to see that.  I don't want to see that.  But none of them are...  Ew.  There's a couple from this...  That looks fake.  It's just creepy, though.  There's a couple of guys who are tied up.  That's like old school tying someone up.  Yeah.  Oh, man. 
[00:12:30]  Those were all women who were killed.  And these...  There's a girl there from, like, the 70s.  He cut her tattoos off and got rid of her body.  And these guys were tied up and, like, two guys, different guys...  Oh, he doesn't look very happy.  They were raped for days and tortured for days.  What the fuck?  And then fucking killed.  What the fuck?  Jimmy.  What the fuck?  I just want to fuck around and do a fun little morning show.  And then I can't sleep.  What the fuck is going on?  Leave your evil shit at home. 
[00:13:00]  Jimmy Norton.  And then he wonders why he can't sleep.  That first picture, though, is fucking chilling, right?  Yeah, it's all chilling.  I know it's out there.  I don't search this shit out.  But she's totally dressed.  She's just in, like, an abandoned old house.  For the creeps out there, where did they find this?  I found mine on a different site.  I just Googled last photos taken by serial killers.  Oh, creepy.  And it's the first language.  God, man.  I thought we were talking about Beyonce or something.  Yeah, right?  Like everybody else.  The weather.  Oh, it's chilly.  Do you dream about this shit? 
[00:13:30]  I don't know.  I don't dream.  You don't have enough time to sleep to dream.  Yeah, yeah.  Jimmy's dreams are like, you know, you walk to the front door and walk up.  Yeah.  I dreamt that I went to the mailbox.  You like serial killer shit.  Yeah, I just happened to stumble on that.  You've read a lot of the books.  I like serial.  I just happened to stumble on that.  You know a lot of that shit.  Yeah, I didn't know who any of those guys were.  Except for Jerome Brutus.  They're just creeps.  Yeah, I don't even know Jerome Brutus.  No, no.  Terrible people.  Wow.  I would have said he played for the Packers back in the early 70s. 
[00:14:00]  I remember him.  Yeah, sure.  He was amazing.  Hall of Famer.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Wow, man.  How do we come back from that?  I'll tell you.  Going to sleep, man.  I'll be watching TV.  And I'll be awake.  Shit like that.  And then the second I want to go to sleep, I turn my head away from the television.  I swear within three fucking minutes, I am gone.  Zonked out.  It's like I couldn't.  But the thing is, I understand how nice that is. 
[00:14:30]  Like I have a great appreciation for the sleep.  And to not be able to do it would be horrible.  Just laying there like, ah, sleep.  There are times I wake up after like 12 hours straight of sleeping.  Thinking maybe I want a little more.  And I'm laying there going like, I don't think I'm going to be able to get back to sleep.  I couldn't imagine wanting to sleep and being in that position.  You don't wake up during the night?  No.  I wake up every fucking night.  If I do, I'm right back to sleep.  But I do get my hours in. 
[00:15:00]  So you fall asleep and that's it until you wake.  Bam!  Out, alarm goes off.  That's beyond amazing.  That's a rarity.  There's not many people listening to our voices right now that that happens to.  I slept from like 11 o'clock last night until, you know, about an hour ago, I guess.  Are you rested?  Yeah, I feel very rested.  But you know what?  Absolutely.  If I laid on that couch right now, I'm not shitting you.  I could fucking go to sleep.  Then why don't we, we should have an experiment.  I want to see how fast it takes for you to fall asleep. 
[00:15:30]  That would be your favorite bit.  Under that pressure, it might be a little difficult.  I'm sure the lawyers would approve that bit, right?  Yeah.  I think they would approve that one.  I don't know.  This fucking who gives a shit story.  Oh, Jimmy couldn't sleep, Opie.  It's not a who gives a shit.  I'm tuckered out.  It's on the front page of our papers.  Beyonce faked it.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  Who gives a shit?  Although I was wrong because we brought this up yesterday and Ant said she was lip syncing. 
[00:16:00]  I said no fucking way because she pulled out her earpiece.  It turns out she was lip syncing, but in the end, who gives a fuck?  That earpiece thing is a good fucking point.  You think that was the gag?  Yeah.  It's a good gag.  Makes it seem like you really don't know.  Oh, fuck.  I can't.  Yeah.  The music's a little too loud in my ear, so I got to fucking focus a little more.  Let me do that.  I'm thinking, you know what?  And who cares?  You're right.  No one cares.  But there is a reason.  I mean, if you looked at the other performances, the band was drowning out the singers.  And I'm sure they didn't want that for the big national anthem. 
[00:16:30]  It's also symbolic, though, of how we can't just have a singer sing a song.  The whole country is so fucking bent on things.  We're just a fake, paranoid nation.  It's annoying.  Well, I think she should have sang the song, of course.  Sure.  But this shit was started a long time ago where they don't sing their songs anymore in a lot of these situations.  Kelly Clarkson did it live.  Of course.  She did, right?  And she did a great job.  But who gives a fuck?  James Taylor.  It's the lead story.  And they're showing Milli Vanilli.  You idiots.  That's a different story. 
[00:17:00]  Milli Vanilli, they never even sang their songs ever.  Yeah, that was all fakery.  That would be like, I think you said it before the show, that would be like if she was lip-syncing Whitney Houston.  Whitney Houston's version, right.  That's a Milli Vanilli situation, you idiots.  Yeah.  That was like one of the first ones.  I think Whitney, during like the first Gulf War, and she was singing the national anthem at a big event.  It would be football.  Oh, was it?  Yes.  And they pre-recorded it.  It was like pre-recorded.  And it was an amazing job.  Wait, which one was pre-recorded?  Now I'm all confused. 
[00:17:30]  The Whitney Houston one from...  The famous one.  God, that was like...  Star Spangled Banner?  Yeah, yeah.  Completely pre-recorded?  Or did she just use a backing track?  No, it was completely pre-recorded.  Were you sure?  And it wound up being a huge event.  Which one?  Because she sang two amazing renditions.  She sang only a couple of years ago, I think, at the Super Bowl.  No, it was the one from...  And then the one in the 90s, right?  First Gulf War, yeah.  93-ish?  Yeah, maybe.  That was pre-recorded, too.  Yeah, yeah.  See, anybody could do that.  All four of us could do a perfect version of the Star Spangled Banner.  I've read that it's very rare, almost never, that at the inauguration, it's pre-recorded. 
[00:18:00]  And I think that's where everybody's making a big deal about it.  I don't care.  Super Bowl, it's normal.  Halftime show, it's normal.  Apparently, you know, Bruce Springsteen...  Of course, all these real singers do it.  Everyone has done it.  Not Bruce.  Shut up.  You go to some of these shows, they're lip-syncing half their fucking concert.  Because they have to worry about their dumb dance moves.  91 Super Bowl, Whitney Houston.  91 Super Bowl.  Yeah.  Let's hear that. 
[00:18:30]  Sure.  The 91 Super Bowl.  Who's Sam?  He's cutting some stuff.  I was hoping he was sick.  That was the biggie.  Yeah, the one with a dumb headband on.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, this was...  This was when everybody was feeling pretty patriotic.  It was the perfect storm, you know?  Big game, big Gulf War thing going on.  She fucking knocked it out of the park, as they like to say.  Saddam Hussein. 
[00:19:00]  This is a biggie.  It's like the most famous one?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, sleep as you see.  She had a voice back then.  But even then the band's too loud.  Yeah.  They got fucking chills.  It's a good one.  This is a biggie.  They got a confederate flag, isn't it? 
[00:19:30]  Look at the 80s hair on people still.  This is fucking awesome.  The 90s.  They were still doing the 80s.  Yeah, beginning of the 90s.  Still the 80s.  Look at the patriotism.  Oh.  Dude, this was fucking Gulf War.  People were freaked out.  All psyched.  They wanted America to kick ass.  There's finally a war we could fucking win.  She was fucking beautiful, too, man.  Stupid drugs. 
[00:20:00]  Free fucking dope.  This hit number 20 on the charts.  It's the only time the national anthem is charted.  It's a hit single.  Yeah.  It's a big one.  One of the best finishes ever.  What game is it?  Super Bowl?  Yeah.  She walked away and got a cigarette halfway through it, came back.  Then the Jets go flying.  Holy fuck. 
[00:20:30]  See, look.  She's off mic.  Yeah.  And I'm not free.  Oh.  Oh.  Pull some Whitney.  I'm not alone.  I'm not alone.  She was a sweaty person.  Boy, could Whitney sweat. 
[00:21:00]  Awful 80s jacket she's wearing.  Yeah, big 80s headband.  She's looking like she's ready to do that.  Let's get physical.  Oh, big fucking flyover.  God damn it.  I think the flyover, they mistimed that.  Yeah.  She's walking off the field, and then the Jets go flying by.  That was a fucking huge one.  Yeah, that was a great...  When did it come out that she lip-synced that?  Last week.  Oh, last week.  Yeah, it was amazing.  All right, it's about time.  They had to cover that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  No, it was not for a while, though. 
[00:21:30]  That was like, people were like, oh, fuck, man.  Whitney did a great job.  Yeah, you used to hear that, like, on the radio.  Yeah, of course.  People played that version on the fucking radio, like a song.  Boy, were we fucking revved up to kill some motherfuckers back then.  Holy shit.  Now we just argue as a nation.  It's like, that was pretty much the first thing after, like...  Well, we had those little things like Grenada and shit like that.  But that was pretty much the first thing after the nom, where we were like,  come on, let's get back in the game, people.  Let's kick some fucking ass. 
[00:22:00]  Apparently, it wasn't confirmed until last year.  Last year.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Well, it's still great.  It's still a great moment.  To Beyonce, she did a great job.  Not as good as Whitney Houston.  No.  And I don't give a fuck.  I'll be talking about it ad nauseum all day today.  It's a big story today.  Huge story.  Of course, no one wants to talk about, you know,  the boringness of the unlimited debt ceiling.  Yeah.  Meh, meh. 
[00:22:30]  You know, just keep spending.  Why would that be on the front page of the paper?  Or printing a trillion dollar coin.  Yeah, that affects everybody.  I want the trillion dollar coin.  Yeah.  I wonder if I can take it to the Pawn Stars.  You don't know.  Yeah, well, you know what?  I took my trillion dollar coin down here to see what I could get for it.  Yeah, well, you know, not much of a market for a trillion dollars.  I'll give you 500 for it.  I was pretty happy.  I was hoping to get a trillion dollars, but I'm pretty happy.  I'm pretty happy with this. 
[00:23:00]  You think?  I left with, I came in with a coin.  I left with paper money.  I think you would sleep well at night having a trillion dollar coin.  A trillion dollar coin.  What are you doing with it?  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  Could you break a trillion?  The paranoia you would feel knowing you had a trillion dollar coin in your pocket.  A trillion dollar coin.  Walking around.  Holy shit.  That would be a great plot for a movie.  Yeah, you have to, everybody's trying to get your trillion dollar coin.  But that should be on the front page.  We're just printing up another trillion, huh? 
[00:23:30]  Well, that was one of the things they were thinking of doing.  They're just going to leave the debt with no ceiling so that the government can keep spending and spending and spending.  Because these idiots don't know what the fuck they're doing.  And they'd rather argue with each other over and over again.  There's been no balanced budget for years.  Right.  And the American people want one.  Right.  This is something we're always hearing about what the American people want and the will of the people.  And the politicians will do the will of the people.  The American people want a balanced budget.  And they actually have floated an idea of that Congress should not get paid until they get a balanced budget. 
[00:24:00]  But that one always gets knocked down.  I wonder why.  But if that's what the people want.  Aren't they representing us?  Yeah.  Right up until you tell them they're not getting paid.  And as soon as you don't pay them.  Yeah.  They'll fucking figure it out quick.  Yep.  They start getting a little.  You want shit done in Washington.  That's what you do.  Yeah.  You see the other story here today?  The Michelle Obama rolling her eyes at the dinner.  Yeah.  And Boehner. 
[00:24:30]  She's sitting in between Boehner and the president.  Right.  And Boehner says something to the president.  She looks over and rolls her fucking eyes like, oh, God.  They got a lip reader to actually see what the conversation was between Boehner and the president.  And what was it?  It was, uh, you sucked my cock last night.  It was delicious.  Uh, I came like I never had before.  My orgasm with you was, that's the cheever letters.  I saw that video.  I saw that video too.  And I, it's, it's gotta be a bummer because, you know, it's Barack, whether you like him  or hate him, it's his big day. 
[00:25:00]  And he has to sit right the fuck next to the one guy that hates his gut.  That douchebag.  Boehner's a douche.  I don't like, I don't like Boehner, Boehner, Boehner.  Boehner.  Boehner.  But how about the wife rolling her eyes at your conversation with the guy?  It's like, shut up and eat.  Kind of like it.  I don't know.  Kind of like it.  The conversation was about, uh, he, he asked, Boehner asked, um, Obama if he had smoked  a cigarette that day.  Why would he ask that?  I guess the insiders know that he probably still slips a cigarette when he's, uh.  He probably smokes a lot.  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  They got that shit figured out where no one will see him smoke.  And she rolled her eyes at the question and Obama said no.  And they're also speculating he was chewing a lot of gum on this parade route.  Yeah.  So it's probably nicotine gum.  He's struggling with cigarettes.  He's probably struggling with cigarettes.  But that's a dick move by Boehner.  Yeah, it's a dick move.  He knows what he was getting at.  And Michelle Obama was just like, oh, this fucking white guy, get him away from me.  Yeah, she was annoyed because he's still smoking.  Well, true.  She's probably not happy with that one.  But you're the president. 
[00:26:00]  Fuck, you should be allowed to smoke.  Why does Boehner get to sit right there?  Because he's that powerful, obviously.  But I mean, it's Barack's big day.  Fucking wouldn't you want to be at the table with people you like?  You think.  But you know how weddings are sometimes.  You're sitting at the table and go, ah, I don't want to be with this guy.  No, but that's the head table.  Oh.  The head table is usually, you know, everyone kind of gets along.  Oh.  Right.  I understand when you're at a dopey wedding and you're sitting with people you don't want  to be with.  So apparently he asked Obama whether he had a chance to have a cigarette before the luncheon.  The lip reader told Inside Edition that Boner, a known smoker, Boehner, sorry, tapped the 
[00:26:30]  first lady on the arm before telling the president that somebody won't let you do it.  Oh, nice.  Like you pussy whip motherfucker.  Wow.  He is a prick.  Oh, he's a prick.  All right.  He's fucking with him.  But I kind of respect that a little bit.  That's kind of funny.  Hey.  That's kind of funny.  Elbow nudge, nudge.  Hey, leader of the free world.  Yeah.  He's right.  The old ball and chain, not like you smoke, eh.  All right.  You know what?  You might have turned me on this one.  That's a good one.  But Boehner is a dick. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, shit.  That's funny.  You just could see.  Yeah, he's a fucking prick.  He's the one that wouldn't vote on Sandy stuff.  Right.  Yeah.  He's a twat.  Yeah.  And that hits us here at Holes.  Well, to his credit, they also said it was packed with a bunch of fucking bullshit.  Yeah.  Pork and earmarks.  There's Washington for you, right?  Yeah.  Exactly.  How about a bill that has just the thing that's supposed to fucking be and not with everything  else piled on it?  Ah, what do I know?  I go for a container of coffee.  They don't throw rolls in it. 
[00:27:30]  Right or wrong?  I think you're right there, regular Joe.  Ooh.  Regular Joe stinks.  You want to hear a montage of idiots talking about Beyonce?  This is the biggest story of the day.  They're leading with this story.  There's plenty of real news that people should hear about, but they're leading with this.  We had a couple of gangsters shooting each other on a college campus, right?  That was a shooting at a school, not a school shooting.  Big difference. 
[00:28:00]  I, I, when that hit, CNN, they all had fucking hard-ons.  I love this shit.  I love studying this shit and how ridiculous the media is.  When that story hit, I went right to CNN.  You could, you could, I was ready to say you could feel, hello.  You could, you could just see that they all had hard-ons.  Pumped up.  And they couldn't wait.  They thought the body count was going to be a, you know, way up there.  They thought it was going to be a lot like Newtown.  They were fucking jonesing.  Oh, were they ever.  They were loving it.  And then to watch them slowly have to back out of it. 
[00:28:30]  Because it was, quote, a beef between two guys.  Yeah, it's a gang fucking related shooting.  And it wasn't what they thought it was at first.  You could see they were so fucking bummed out.  And they were slowly trying to, like, back out of the story and move on with other shit.  Because it wasn't like the other school shootings.  No, this is a couple of thugs that had a little beef on a campus down there in Houston, Texas.  Right.  And they shot each other.  And I guess somebody else got, took a bullet too.  Or a couple of people.  And no one cares about thugs shooting each other. 
[00:29:00]  Obviously.  It happens on a daily basis in every big city.  Right.  But they, when a school's shooting, they're like, oh, mom, lockdown.  Oh, we love the word lockdown.  They were excited.  Yeah.  And then they were misrepresenting it.  They're saying, this just in.  And I said to someone that was in my house yesterday, I'm like, just in.  This story hit four hours ago.  Yeah.  And they're still showing the video, but they don't put live.  But the average person wouldn't notice that it doesn't say live. 
[00:29:30]  So they think that it's happening now.  That it's happening.  But they're just rolling the same shit that they rolled four hours prior.  Yeah.  They just suck, man.  All of them.  It really is.  And then they were bummed out that it wasn't a big time, you know, body.  School shooting.  Body count, bodies piling up, school shooting.  And they had to back out and try to move on to other stories.  And I'll bet you they won't show these guys faces and names on the front page every day.  Yeah.  How about that?  Let's see if they show these two fucking faces.  Of course not.  Yeah.  Why would they?  It's just thugs. 
[00:30:00]  They were actually doing a stand-up in front of the location and the reporters out there.  And there's a guy, a black guy behind the reporter with his fingers like he had fucking arthritis throwing up gang signs.  He's just fucking throwing up gang signs like a madman.  What the hell is that?  Oh, another.  You haven't seen this yet?  No.  Where was this from?  The lady on the trail.  I think it's a lady.  Subway.  Would she fall?  Madrid.  Oh, she passes out, it looks like, and does a header. 
[00:30:30]  Who falls asleep that close to a train?  And they were able to alert the train that was coming, and they rescued her as well.  A couple of guys jumped down.  Well, a happy ending.  Pulled her to the other side a little bit.  Happy ending to that story.  And then the rest of the people on the platform, they were able to slow down the train by getting the driver's attention.  Oh, that's nice.  You saw the one in Philly where the lady was dragged?  No.  That was last week, too.  What happened?  Is she dead?  That one, I'm not sure.  There's been a couple of these things that have happened. 
[00:31:00]  I guess they're having a meeting to try to figure out how to make things safer in the subways.  How about you get someone down there and go, hey, everybody, how about you fucking put your back up against the wall?  Back up.  Yeah, stop standing.  That's what I do.  With a pillow.  Stop being a fucking nosy Nelly or whatever and taking a peek to see if the train's coming.  I think you'll know when the train gets there.  Right.  Yeah.  It's very, very loud, very big.  You don't have to put your skull over the tracks to see if it's coming.  What about that guy that was peeking and got hit in the back of the head with the train?  I know.  Oh, I know the story there, but remember? 
[00:31:30]  He died?  No, we were at NEW, and there was a big story where a guy leaned over, like you said, Jimmy,  and he was looking.  He's looking like north.  He was looking for the train, but he was looking the wrong way, and as he was looking the wrong  way, the train fucking smacked him on the other side.  In the back of the head.  It's hilarious.  Hilarious, exactly, and we're doing easily an hour on it like it's nothing.  Oh, boy.  And then someone came in and said, you know, I don't even want to say your name, you know  Blah Blah, who worked at NEW? 
[00:32:00]  It was her son.  It was her son.  Oh, no.  Your son is an idiot.  We were extremely close to that story.  So he was killed?  I don't remember.  No, he was fucked up, though.  He was fucked up.  I think he was fucked up.  I knew a few kids, like, growing up throughout my existence through school and everything,  where you knew a kid that was hit by a train and lived, and they always end up with  that name, Trainee.  It's like, hey, yo, Trainee.  What do you mean you knew a couple?  I knew, like, two kids growing up.  Man.  Like, one from, like, one town, and then when I moved, there was somebody else. 
[00:32:30]  But they're always named Trainee.  I knew two guys that had interactions with trains.  They were 0 for 2.  Yeah, exactly.  Neither one of them told about it.  No, these kids, like, one kid was all fucked up.  Like, he was limping, and, like, his arm hung to the side, and he was Trainee.  Hey, Trainee, what's up?  Was he trying to kill himself?  No, I think it was an accident.  Imagine that, though.  Yeah, you've lived through that, and you've got to be reminded every time someone calls  you that a train hit you.  Hey, Trainee, ah, fuck.  For a split second, I forgot I was hit by a train.  Thanks.  He probably likes his nickname, fuck it.  You think he likes it?  Yeah, yeah, fuck it.  He's a lot of shit. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Jesus.  So, Beyonce.  Yeah, so, the big story.  Gives a shit.  Everyone, apparently.  We're doing this montage just to show you how stupid the media is.  They all go with it.  The one, I don't know who starts this shit, and then everyone goes, oh, God, this is what  we've got to do.  We've got to do it.  Everyone else is doing it, so we should do it, too.  Let's run with the Beyonce story.  Let's lead with that.  Right.  And then we'll go into, you know, real news.  Well, actually, the Boehner Obama cigarette story.  But what happens?  Like, why can't one media outlet, one local news station, one cable news station, I don't 
[00:33:30]  give a fuck who it is, just go on TV and go, who gives a shit?  You give the human beings too much credit.  People love this.  If you go into work...  Is that what it comes down to?  Go into work.  Listen to Scuttlebutt Between Cubicles.  You'll hear Beyonce, Beyonce lip sync, Beyonce.  But wouldn't you be the cool news if all of a sudden you were the guy who goes, look,  everyone's talking about this, who gives a fuck?  You'd be the news no one watches.  You think?  People are sheep and they're assholes.  Then what?  We should be talking about it like, oh, this is, oh my God. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  Can you believe this?  You know what?  Turn on fucking, turn on Scott and Todd right now.  I bet they're fucking talking about Beyonce.  I bet they're lip syncing a song parody.  Oh, fuck.  I was trying to do it, Todd, and I failed miserably.  Oh, I'm saying a lie.  Well, that's Scott, but I'm like, oh, I think she's a second lie.  But then Todd with that cartoon voice I was attempting and I failed.  Well, you do it.  Can you see if Scott and Todd are doing anything on Beyonce today?  And I'm sure the stupid morning mashup's down.  Oh, what's the mashup doing? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, boy.  Sam, can you secretly get their chatter on Beyonce?  Sam.  How do we do that?  Get their chatter.  You know their first break they're going to talk about.  When do they start?  Oh, my God.  That's giving me a call.  Oh, my God.  I told you.  And they're like, no, we didn't know.  Oh, look out.  They start at seven.  Yeah?  Seven.  Well, I mean, that's the way they're in the live.  They put on the last hour of yesterday's show at six, but people don't listen to the  whole show, so everybody thinks they start at six.  I wanted to start this show a little later.  They start at seven.  Sway starts at eight.  What the fuck?  Mashup goes seven to ten. 
[00:35:00]  Jesus Christ.  And they have music.  How many songs they play?  Are you kidding me?  A ton.  I think they have eight guys doing the show.  I think it's four.  But some of them are bigger.  Jeez.  Anyway, here's Beyonce.  This is what the news is doing today.  Did she or didn't she?  That's the question many people are asking this morning after some.  No one's asking.  You're making it a thing.  You're saying.  Everyone's asking.  Who's everybody?  Oh, society.  All those words they use.  Everybody.  People are saying.  Our sources. 
[00:35:30]  People are saying.  Did she or didn't she?  That's the question many people are asking this morning after some say Beyonce was lip syncing  during her performance at the president's inauguration.  And later this half hour, did Beyonce really lip sync at the president's inauguration?  Sing the song.  Well, here's my question.  The Marine band said they did not have time to rehearse.  And I worked the weekend.  I was on the hill.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She's really going into it.  Oh, my God.  I worked the hill. 
[00:36:00]  Shut up.  You know who that is?  How about me working your mound?  That was everybody's favorite.  Morning Joe sidekick.  Oh.  No.  That's not Mika.  Oh, Mika wasn't on today.  Mika's not on today.  Oh.  That's a fill-in.  Is there another blonde?  It was some other hole.  Yeah, no.  You know Mika when you hear her.  Where's Mika?  What's wrong with her?  She's the one that sounds like she's got to stick up her ass constantly.  Why isn't she there today?  She's in France, I guess.  Oh, of course she is.  Yeah, morning Joe.  Joe made a fucking little jab at her and said, well, we'll find out her opinion when 
[00:36:30]  she gets back on her G5 from France.  It's like, ooh, not quite the regular little gal about town.  She's kind of a twat.  She's not Jenny from the block, I'll tell you that much.  No, no.  I hope she's having her vagina stitched.  Like, I hope she had a vaginal accident.  Like, on a sawhorse.  Like, she likes to do sawhorse leaps, and she misjudged terribly.  That would be terrible.  Yeah, and had her fucking, she had weights on each foot, so her legs got split down.  Oh, my God, they're actually paying tribute to Joe Paterno, marking the one-year anniversary 
[00:37:00]  of his death.  They're lighting candles.  Yep, that's cool.  They should fill boys' underwears with sadness.  That's how they should fucking mark his death.  Fuck him.  Fuck Joe Paterno.  Is it one year today?  Yeah.  I guess so, huh?  Time flies when you're not getting a dick in your ass.  Exactly.  Time flies when you're telling nobody nothing.  Time flies when you're just thinking about your legacy.  Oh, fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Wow, man, they just fucking love him no matter what. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, that's...  All right, well, she's working on the hill.  Let's see what she has to say about...  Yeah, Beyonce.  Beyonce.  We'll go back and work on the hill.  I'm going to talk about the budget.  Did not have time to rehearse.  And I worked the weekend.  I was on the hill.  Kelly Clarkson rehearsed.  Other people rehearsed.  I'm a huge Beyonce fan.  If you're going to sing at the inauguration, how do you not have time to rehearse?  Now, some say they understand this is what performers do at very important events, but  others feel duped.  I thought she did an excellent job.  She sang really well. 
[00:38:00]  She's passionate, and I thought it was a moving, something moving to watch.  But now, there are reports her singing wasn't what everyone thought.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  And freericorded the performances with all of the inaugural singers, but reportedly Beyonce's  was the only one that ended up being used.  The country is buzzing this morning about another performance for the inaugural- 
[00:38:30]  No!  You're buzzing!  Bzzz!  Bzzz!  Bzzz!  Bzzz!  You know what, I'm happy she's getting a beating for it!  Yeah?  Yeah, because it's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing, and it's like I'm so sick of fucking singers faking this shit.  If you can't do it then don't do it.  Don't sing.  Look, we're doing the same thing now.  We're talking about it.  Yeah, we are!  We're buzzing!  We're buzzing!  We're buzzing.  We're buzzing.  See, this is failing.  But it sounds like they record everybody just in case,  and then in her case, she said,  fuck it, we're going with the pre-recording. 
[00:39:00]  It just annoys me that they do that.  They're like, oh, isn't she wonderful?  No, she didn't sing it live.  If you don't sing it live, go fuck yourself.  Yo-Yo Ma used a recording.  Who's Yo-Yo Ma?  The cellist?  Who's Yo-Yo Ma?  My God, man.  He was there?  No, last inauguration.  Yeah, four years ago.  What was the reason for that?  He said the weather affected his instrument.  Oh, he's a douche.  The strings.  And don't play it.  How about that?  Get a piano player.  Because the weather four years ago,  it was very cold,  and that would affect the strings on his cello. 
[00:39:30]  Jimmy's solution.  Get a piano player.  Exactly.  But don't play that fucking gay fucking thing  in front of the whole country.  We all got to tolerate it  because Obama's a Harvard nerd.  Yo-Yo Ma?  Give us some Yo-Yo Ma.  Yo-Yo Ma.  Yo-Yo Ma, nobody likes cello playing.  No.  You'll tolerate it if the option is wisdom truth removal.  This guy knows how to play the cello.  You'll also tolerate it  if it's with the rest of a fucking orchestra.  I ain't listening to no solo cello.  No, man.  He was great.  Get the YouTube clip.  Oh.  Even though he didn't play live.  Yo-Yo Ma. 
[00:40:00]  Stop it.  Gonna get some culture in this house today.  I like the Duncan Butterfly better.  Yo-Yo Ma.  Yo-Yo Ma.  What a dumb name.  Where's the Yo-Yo?  Yo-Yo.  Yo-Yo-Yo.  You think they say that?  Yo-Yo-Yo.  It was from four years ago.  It was very cold that day.  So Yo-Yo said, fuck this.  I'm gonna make believe I'm playing.  He lip-synced a cello?  Hey, that's a violin.  He's next to that dude.  I can't say. 
[00:40:30]  That sounds terrible.  Yeah.  Is this a joke?  It must be a joke.  Yeah.  That's funny.  This is one of those goofs.  I love these.  Usually it's with the big bands.  Yeah.  Or when they show a guy doing a guitar solo.  It's hilarious.  Yeah.  Good find.  We got everyone looking at him.  That's fucking funny, man. 
[00:41:00]  The video is Yo-Yo shreds at the inauguration.  The shredding.  Whoever came up with shredding is a genius.  With Perlman.  It's really not good playing.  It really looks like they're playing this. 
[00:41:30]  Black guy playing a clarinet.  Poorly.  He really did a good job on this one.  Oh, you gotta see this.  Oh, we gotta put this up on the site.  And then they got the reaction shots from Biden and Obama. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, it's great.  It's really funny.  We'll put it up on our Facebook page, Hopi and Anthony.  That's good.  All right, well, let's go back to the monitor.  Being used.  The country is buzzing this morning about another performance for the inauguration.  And as it turns out, Beyoncé may have lip-synced the national anthem.  Blah.  Well, Beyoncé's performance of the national anthem at President Obama's inauguration was memorable.  But the question that a lot of people are asking now, was she even singing?  The conspiracy theory grows.  This morning, there are accusations that Beyoncé was actually lip-syncing. 
[00:42:30]  We're talking about Beyoncé and the inaugural national anthem.  Um, please, please station, really?  Well, you decide for yourself.  You know what we're talking about when action needs to be.  First praised for her beautiful rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner.  Now Beyoncé hearing a ton of criticism.  So, did she really sing or did she lip-sync?  And then gunfire on a college campus in Texas leaves students running for cover. 
[00:43:00]  Did Beyoncé really sing the national anthem live?  The Marine Corps band said her inauguration performance was a fake, but now it's singing a different tune.  Is it?  Boo!  Fucking, wow.  What a load.  People are saying, people are buzzing.  Everyone's buzzing about it.  The news is trying to get something going.  Scuttlebutt.  Yeah, they're saying people are saying, they should just say, we're reporting this.  Yes, please do that. 
[00:43:30]  Or list some of the people that are saying.  We're making people say.  Yeah.  Because we're the media.  Exactly.  People are repeating what we said.  Right.  Right.  We're hoping this creates a buzz.  Yeah.  Because no one's talking about this, but we're hoping.  The news is just morphed into something unrecognizable.  It's creating the story, not reporting it.  Yes, yes, yes.  Absolutely.  They're creating the story.  Absolutely.  Not just with this, but with many things on a daily basis.  They're pushing this forward way more than it needs to be.  So they have something to talk about.  It's fucking weird. 
[00:44:00]  A couple of entertainment sites probably should have ran with it a little bit, because that's  their thing.  And then the rest of the news should be like, whatever.  Or maybe throw it in real late.  It's on the front page of the paper today.  Yeah.  I was watching a little local news today, which no one really watches anymore.  So they got to come up with these things to make it exciting or different or something.  Right.  Imagine WPIX news this morning.  I don't understand what they're trying to do.  They got that Lionel guy.  Who's Lionel?  Oh, Lionel.  That guy that talks like this, and he's a regular kind of, hey, this is what's happening 
[00:44:30]  in the world today.  He was a radio talk show host.  A giant peanut head.  And I think he might have tried comedy, too.  Really?  One of my first TV spots was on Lionel's show.  Right.  He was very...  I have a photo with me and him at the desk, and he's leaning across, nicely putting his  hand on my forearm.  He was a nice man.  Yeah, he seems like a nice enough guy.  He seems nice, but he stinks.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  I think he's an ex-lawyer, too.  Is he?  I think he used to be a lawyer, and then he got into radio. 
[00:45:00]  And now he does some TV.  They do the story, right?  Yeah.  And then Lionel comments on the story.  What story was he commenting on?  Every story.  So why don't we...  We should play that.  It's the weirdest, most out-of-place thing for the news.  They'll be like, and Beyonce didn't sing the national anthem and stuff.  He's like, and then Lionel comes on, and it says, Lionel, and what he thinks.  And he comments on the story.  Who cares what Lionel thinks?  I know!  That's exactly what I said.  I need to hear it now, though. 
[00:45:30]  Watch some of Lionel.  Can we find that?  Yeah, find some Lionel.  Any Lionel.  Every TV station needs someone commenting.  Regular Joe would be perfect, because that's exactly what he's doing.  What do I know?  I can't lip sync on the job site.  I tell the boss I got a container of coffee.  I better have one.  See, I'd watch that.  I would watch that.  Regular Joe.  He said, why don't you put that brick up there?  I said, I'm just going to practice in rehearsal.  Yeah, good luck over there, Joe.  Oh, good one, Joe.  Thanks.  How about Dr. King had guts?  Oh, there you go.  Because the whole I Have a Dream was, what, 50 years ago? 
[00:46:00]  Here's what Lionel does.  Okay, this is topical.  That's him?  Yeah, he's different.  He's a peanut head.  Yeah, I wonder if he's sick, to be honest with you.  He's got a giant peanut head.  Isn't he?  He's got a beard, I think.  We know this is more.  He's got, it's not quite a beard.  He's got scruffy whiskers.  You see ESPN's revolting tweet on Martin Luther King's birthday?  Today, every game ball is for Dr. King.  That's so stupid.  Who said that?  ESPN.  I really am starting to hate ESPN.  And I'm glad they missed the Mateo story, those dummies. 
[00:46:30]  Fucking scaredy cats.  Ridiculous.  We got an update on Teo, too.  Yeah.  Teo.  Is it Teo or Mateo?  Am I saying it wrong?  Mateo.  It's Manti.  Manti, Teo.  Yeah, officially, yes.  Mateo.  I see.  Lilo, Lilo, Lilo, Lilo, Lilo, Lilo, Lilo, Lilo.  You've got all different poses.  On this, the third Monday in January of the year, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  I think of his absolute guts. 
[00:47:00]  Plain and simple.  Yeah, on the balcony.  We talk about courage and heroes in this country, but risking your life for a cause places you  in the exalted pantheon of superhero.  Who among us would risk his life and his family's life for a noble cause?  And certainly, veterans have served bravely and put their lives on the line and died.  But this is different.  Dr. King said to racist America, you can't scare me.  And I'm not going away.  Who's the Dr. King today?  That is to risk one's life.  To advance a noble cause, at least in this country. 
[00:47:30]  But this man risked himself and his family, and I can't say that enough.  And here's the truth.  Yes, he can.  If you ask me to do the same for a cause I truly believed in, I'm afraid I'd be afraid,  no, petrified of dying, especially if I was repeatedly told they were going to kill me  and after they tried and firebombed my home.  How did he have the guts to say, fine, count me in.  And everyone conspired against him.  Hoover, the FBI, Bill Conner, even RFK and JFK. 
[00:48:00]  How about the white women he was apparently with?  Did they conspire against them?  And target of actual and real conspiracies, not theories.  Which brings me to this conspiracy tone deafness and almost dyslexia this country enjoys.  Hoover, whatever you today ask about something that may involve government, cover up, intel, CIA, FBI, name it.  The level of sophistication of the average.  I'm embarrassed.  This is what he does with every news story.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, he was commenting on the Beyonce thing, and then he commented on the fucking, um, the budget.  He sounds like a very weak Joe Pesci.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But that wasn't actually what he does in the morning.  That's like one of his segments.  Oh.  But this was every fucking story.  Can we go to today's, uh, Channel 11 News there and find it?  I like Lionel.  You can put it in the back.  We can't watch him.  Yeah, let's do that.  Let's do that.  Voice of reason.  Let's grab, uh, Lionel's segment from, uh, today.  He was, like, doing a bit about how he was lip syncing, and all they did was put an echo on his voice. 
[00:49:00]  I'm lip syncing right now!  It was so bad.  But I guess, you know, local news is trying to do something to make it seem relevant.  Well, they could start by not doing five-minute forecasts.  Uh, yeah.  And traffic.  Well, they love their traffic and weather together.  Wow, Suki got fat, huh?  Oh, poor Suki.  Suki!  Who's Suki?  Uh, Mambaric was born.  I remember Suki.  I guess his name is Milan.  Mm-hmm.  Was born Tuesday in Barcelona, Spain.  He weighed in at six pounds, six ounces.  The 35-year-old Colombian singer first revealed a pregnancy back in September. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, this is a couple's first child.  Yeah.  The hipster wife brought a new mom.  Suki!  Okay, there's this video.  Here's a cat that has taken the whole cat and dog fight to a whole other level.  That's a scary-looking cat.  They're showing cat videos.  Right?  And apparently she prowls the block on the Upper East Side, but she's not looking for mice.  No, no, no.  She wants to attack the dogs.  Oh, will she jump out at dogs that have walked on a leash?  One day when she was a nice kitten.  Dorable.  I sure like a good cat video.  We got it from me.  We see it five years back, and she was a little smug.  This is a story, by the way. 
[00:50:00]  Cats attack everything.  Why are they doing this?  Why are they doing this story?  Cats attack everything.  They're assholes.  You can't lose with a good cat video.  Are you kidding me?  Even the news knows that.  Why is that news?  Cat videos, they're adorable.  Attacks dogs.  Yeah.  You should have some kittens, though.  Mech.  Oh, my God.  Mech.  So stupid.  Adorable.  So stupid.  Who's this fucking idiot?  Who's that now?  Back to help out with. 
[00:50:30]  I'm Dan Manorino on Long Island, and I'll have that story coming up.  Oh, I'll have that story.  All right, Gilliam.  A surge in deaths on the subway tracks has one local official calling for action.  Is this live right now?  He'll tell you what he wants.  Oh, they might have a vinyl there.  Now at seven, what's the best way to keep subway riders safe?  Weigh in on Facebook.  I don't think they should be kept safe.  You can check to see what the sea is really using internet on a daily basis.  I'm Lionel.  Check out the new toy that has some people flying off the handle.  Ah, Jesus. 
[00:51:00]  Call it a labor of love.  Why two men went through labor for their job.  What do they do?  Do they tell you how it feels to go through labor?  Yes, they put electrodes on their bellies.  I bet that hurts.  And they would cramp up.  It wouldn't be fun.  No, no, it wouldn't.  I've watched it twice.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, you gotta do a lot of things on the job site.  Holy fuck.  Hey, uh...  Joe.  Oh, my God.  I forgot what it was gonna...  Oh.  Oh.  The subway thing.  Yeah.  Millions of people ride the subway every day.  We've had, what, two?  People don't care about the ratio of safety to bad things that happen. 
[00:51:30]  You're never gonna have a perfect record.  They want perfection.  But now they want action.  Some fucking politician wants action.  Keep it safe.  They want perfection.  Don't lean over.  I'm so fucking paranoid.  My back is against whatever I can find.  Yes.  And if no one's around, maybe I'll take a little peek real fast.  Sure.  What are some of these other countries?  Then I'll move back to my spot.  Some of them have rails up.  They got gates.  Like Japan, I think, has gates.  And then the gate goes down and fucking...  When the train's there.  Somebody will get crushed by the gate or get trapped. 
[00:52:00]  Of course, of course.  50 Cent's?  50 Cent's?  50 Cent is 10 minutes away?  We better break that.  Yeah, we're gonna break so we can talk to 50 Cent next.  Or can we say 50?  You can say whatever you like.  Where's who, kid?  He should come in.  And we also have John Jones and Shale Sonnen coming in today.  Very cool, man.  That's at 8 o'clock.  Yeah.  But 50 Cent will be in studio next.  I'm not doing that.  I'm eating.  I got 10 minutes.

[00:54:30]  Inspirational quotes from the most inspirational man.  If you're not inspired, then you'll be expired.  Jimspirations.  Sirius XM.  It's the O.P. R.D. Show.  We got 50 Cent coming up. 
[00:55:00]  He's going to talk about his new book, Formula 50.  I'm enjoying it.  I'm just looking through it.  A six-week workout, a nutrition plan that will transform your life.  Will you look all ripped like Fitty?  I guess.  Yeah?  I guess so.  Earl yourself up.  Look all nice.  Oh, there's like smoothie recipes and stuff.  What does Mr. Distraction want?  What happened?  Yeah.  What happened to that?  Oof.  What happened?  When I was asking for something, the insight got me a Sharpie for later.  He looked like a nervous Nelly. 
[00:55:30]  He is.  Why is he Mr. Distraction?  No.  I'm just fucking standing there earlier, just looking in the window.  It's like, ugh, get away.  He didn't like it?  Hate interns.  Jesus.  Fucking waste.  You don't think they have potential, most of them?  No.  Jesus.  Fucking 99% useless.  And the 1% that are worth anything are worth something because they're such fucking assholes  that they're funny on the air.  David.  You don't like David?  And fucking that fruit that was singing that fucking song. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  God.  I wish that was still there.  Oh, God.  What about Love Buzz was good?  Love Buzz.  Love Buzz.  That's his name, right?  Oh, yeah.  Fucking duty hat.  Cream Pie Jones.  Cream Pie Jones.  Guy rolled.  Fucking what a collection we've had.  What about what's his name?  Fuck.  He laughed a lot.  The Columbian.  Oscar?  Oscar.  Oscar.  Fucking Oscar.  I forgot Oscar was ever alive.  I love Oscar.  Yes.  Do you think of Oscar often?  Never have thought of Oscar. 
[00:56:30]  I love Oscar.  One of my favorites.  I can't even place his face right now.  So, Sam.  Oh, what happened?  What about Craig?  Who's that?  He's the kid who sat there eating candy for like two hours.  I don't remember Craig.  I don't remember these people.  And then Jay Moore got completely nude in my booth back at K-Rock and ran in and jumped  on his lap.  No, that was Bobby.  That was no homo.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was another one of our incarnate.  What?  The collection. 
[00:57:00]  Sam, what happened behind the scenes when I asked for the Beyonce montage?  Oh, my God.  You were all giddy and excited to bring it to our attention.  Well, no.  I wasn't giddy and excited to come to your attention.  You were kind of excited.  You liked when things go wrong.  Sam walked in and just went.  Yeah, why is he downplaying it now?  Yeah, because he walked in and he was smirking.  Right.  And he was like, what do you guys want as far as this Beyonce thing goes?  Because I have no clue.  He came down the hall and I don't even know what he was talking about. 
[00:57:30]  Because Opia told E-Rock prior to that.  I saw the news right before the show just losing their shit over this Beyonce thing.  And my whole point was who gives a fuck.  So I go to E-Rock.  Hey, man, you know, the news is talking about this Beyonce thing.  I wanted a bunch of clips.  Yeah, get the montage of the anchors.  We've done that before.  The actual montage?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure you said we want to do a montage of all the anchors talking about Beyonce.  So E-Rock went down the hall to tell Sam.  And apparently between here and the office, E-Rock had an aneurysm and completely forgot everything about what we needed. 
[00:58:00]  Or couldn't explain it properly to you?  Yes, because he came in the office.  First, of course, he came in.  And he doesn't just give me, you know, the show's starting in minutes.  So he doesn't just do it quick.  He comes in and goes, hey.  And it just, it drives, that drives me crazy.  I don't know why he starts everything with hey.  And a pause.  He was just saying what he had for breakfast.  Hey. 
[00:58:30]  But there's a very good point in there.  He'll say hey and then pause waiting for you to go, what's up?  It's like he talks like his text.  Right.  So he goes, hey.  I'm like, yeah.  And he goes, yeah.  Oh.  And he starts the deep breaths.  And then he goes, they want, like, clips of some of these anchors talking about Beyonce.  And I go, like, which anchors?  What are you talking about? 
[00:59:00]  Well, they're watching CNN right now.  Okay.  In reference to what?  I don't know.  Like, the headline in the post.  He didn't fucking have it at all.  That's not what I said at all.  He goes by the Costanza rule of if you look annoyed, if you act annoyed at work, it looks like you're busy.  Oh, you got saved by 50 cents.  Yeah.  We won't forget either.  We'll continue this.  Hey, 50 cents.  What's up, man?  What's up, man?  Welcome back to the show.  Take a seat. 
[00:59:30]  How you doing?  How's everything doing?  How you doing?  I'm good.  Man.  It's early, right?  Yeah.  And cold in New York.  They got me up.  We're moving.  Yeah.  We're moving.  Are you an early morning guy usually?  I am.  Really?  I usually get up and get things done while everybody sleeps still.  Oh, man.  Do you usually work out in the morning?  Guys that wake up early and work out, I can't comprehend.  What is the matter with you?  You don't have to do that shit, right?  I can't comprehend.  You know what?  That's the time that you're not missing anything.  Because work didn't start. 
[01:00:00]  The day didn't start yet.  So it's like free time.  Might as well do it.  Get it over with.  I don't know.  But it shortens the evening.  But it gives you that 45 minutes or that hour time before you have to go do everything else.  Would you just be exhausted, Jim?  I can't do it.  Like, I'll do it in the afternoon if I have to.  But I can't imagine waking up an hour early and going, I'm going to hit that gym.  That's harder.  Yeah.  Like that earlier?  The afternoon.  Harder in the...  Yeah.  To get yourself ready to go do that at that point.  Like, you know how people do things out of habit? 
[01:00:30]  Like, some people have adjusted themselves to energy shots, energy drinks, right?  There's no difference between having two cups of coffee in the morning.  But that thing where you're in regimen.  You see that?  Yeah.  That container is something you see commonly in the morning in travel and commute.  Because people got their coffee.  Right.  Well, this is water.  Yeah, but they don't feel like their day is getting started without that.  That shot of caffeine, get them going, and they're like, I'm up.  Mm-hmm.  I'm ready to go. 
[01:01:00]  Because energy drinks got natural B12 and, well, natural B6 and B12 that provide that  energy that you get from that caffeine.  Mm-hmm.  How good is B12?  Because I want to, I know this chick who gets, like, she gives B12 shots in guys' asses.  Oh, Jesus.  And I want to, it's supposed to be really good for you.  Throw a strap on Jimmy.  I know this chick that just gives natural B shots.  Yeah, she gives B12 shots, actually.  That's what the dildo got written on it, B-shot?  Yeah.  Exactly.  You know, he's not that far off. 
[01:01:30]  That's a better guest than you think.  She's a good girl.  But, yeah, B12 is supposed to be, like, really good for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  Is it?  Because then they say it's not.  I mean, it's, like, all, I mean, it's good for you, but not as good as they say it is  for you.  Yeah, like women, they say it's good for you, then they say it's not.  And who knows?  Everything we have, they say it's good.  Yeah, yeah, right, right.  And then a month later, they say it's not.  Well, it's certainly good for you, but not, I don't know, whatever.  So what's going on with, you got your book, Formula 50? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, man, I've been moving around.  This project is something I worked on.  It took me a year to do it.  I thought it would be a lot faster.  Mm-hmm.  You know, and then I had Jeff O'Connor that, you know, helped me, Jeff Cornell.  Okay.  Yeah, and he actually helped me put it together in sequence so I can actually convey the information  the way I would want in proper timelines, you know, for it to feel like a really good book. 
[01:02:30]  It's an expensive-looking book.  No, I'm serious.  There's a lot of pictures and a lot of thought was put into this.  Yeah, we wanted to make it feel good.  And then...  Because there's a lot of exercises in here, and obviously there's pictures of you doing  all the exercises.  And then you got a nice...  There's a hot girl, too.  A hot girl in there, of course.  You're smart.  Yeah, I hand-picked that one.  Yeah, she's smart.  She's very lovely.  She's definitely lovely.  I don't like being...  I'm weird.  Like, do you have a trainer?  I go to the gym.  I hate when people tell me...  I don't like motivation.  One more!  Two more!  You can do it!  She's like, no, I can't! 
[01:03:00]  He's just, no, seriously, I can't.  No, I'm done.  But I did...  I traveled with a nutritionist and a trainer for almost, what, three years.  Wow.  In 2005, I had came back from the first tour, from Get Rich or Die Trying.  Because I traveled so many places I hadn't been, I wasn't comfortable with the different  food standards from America when I was in those different territories.  So I stuck to what I didn't know and what there was the same, and it was the fast food.  Oh, man.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Came back.  Did you pay for it?  Clothes start feeling a little tighter.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, just started getting bigger.  Like, my issue is I can actually look like the security.  Oh, right.  I can get bigger and be looking like...  It's all still there.  It still feels like it's muscle, but it's just too big.  And I'm like, I gotta do something about this.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I brought them in, so they helped me, you know, implement the actual, the dieting portion  of the actual program.  Because I had already made the adjustments physically, like going to the gym and doing 
[01:04:00]  those things.  But it just wasn't coming off the way I wanted it.  Is it like a 50-50 mix between your diet and exercise, or...?  It is.  Yeah?  The dieting is as important as the physical activity.  Right.  You know, and what happens is when people try to lose weight, like, and I made these mistakes  myself, I would eat less.  And then my body starts to slow down and hold on to the actual fat.  Oh, wow.  Because it goes into survival mode.  And when you're accustomed to intake and food in one way, and then you just stop, it feels 
[01:04:30]  like it's actually like you're starving yourself, like you're going into hunger.  Right, right.  So it's like, it's gonna hold on to the fat as long as possible.  Yeah, that is a bizarre concept, because when you're trying to lose weight, you're supposed  to continue to eat.  Yeah.  So your metabolism, like you just said, but you can't wrap your head around it.  You gotta eat the right stuff.  You're like, oh, wait, I'm gonna lose a few pounds, I'm gonna kind of starve myself a  little bit.  But that is actually fucking up your body.  We always do things simple.  It's just one plus one is two.  Yeah.  So we're thinking, okay, I ate too much. 
[01:05:00]  That's how I gained the weight.  Now, let me not eat as much and train.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, and then you'll see a decrease right away, and then your body will stop.  You'll start to level off where it doesn't actually, you know, you're not losing the  weight the same.  Yeah, but your metabolism is losing.  But you never know what you're supposed to eat.  Somebody told me, I thought I was doing a great job.  I would eat like a banana or an apple before workout.  I'm like, oh, good, healthy boy.  And then someone's like, no, stupid, there's sugar in that, so it's gonna make you crash  during the workout.  Yeah, but you know what?  They'll give you, yeah, so you said what exactly is okay to eat. 
[01:05:30]  And it was like, at one point, I felt like I was eating like fuel.  Like it wasn't even for pleasure anymore.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, it was like, what kind of program is this?  You know what I'm saying?  Like this is, and then like I ended, the results was I was like 5% body fat at 180 pounds  because I'm 6'1".  So it was like, okay, like everybody's girlfriend likes me now, but I feel like I ate, I ate wood 
[01:06:00]  for a month.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I think that screws people up too.  That gets them like to not continue doing it because it's more like a job and there's  no real enjoyment.  Right, and there's an adjustment.  When we get to the new year, we'll say, okay, I'm gonna lose this much weight.  You look at yourself, I'm gonna lose 8 pounds or about 4 or 5 pounds or whatever, but we  don't say that we're gonna make the adjustment.  So I'm gonna adjust my lifestyle a little bit because that's really what we mean at that  point. 
[01:06:30]  That we're gonna eat the right way and actually train.  Yeah, yeah.  I like to have a nice vegetable juice too, a nice beet juice and then just go home and  it's fucking for a week, you look like you're shitting blood.  It's horrifying.  You see, that's one of the vegetables I stay so far away from, beets and mushrooms.  Why beets?  I just don't like it.  Beets and a drink are good.  I'll never eat a beet, but I'll drink a beet.  Beets, spinach, kale, and carrot.  Beets are good.  I'll eat a bit.  It just looks like an injury, but I mean, I will eat it.  It's horrifying to look at. 
[01:07:00]  You make a good point though.  Most diets don't work because as soon as you lose the weight, you're like, all right,  I'm done with the diet.  I did it.  And then you go back to eating.  And then you go right back to everything that you did.  You have to completely change your lifestyle and find foods you do enjoy that are healthy.  Yeah, and make the adjustment.  It's not easy.  Then you have it.  If you sustain that actual lifestyle and regimen, it'll be difficult for you to regress or go  back to, you know.  So you got your book, Formula 50, and it's a six-week workout and nutrition plan.  Right.  Do you have something to transition yourself into what to do after that six weeks? 
[01:07:30]  Well, yeah.  Well, I mean, there's like a more advanced program inside the actual book also.  But what we actually did was we took the things that they actually implemented for me over  those different time periods, and then we put it into the actual book because it's what  worked the best for me.  And then there's a period that I had to lose weight for an actual film that I tried to...  You ever heard of The Master Cleanse? 
[01:08:00]  Yes.  Yes.  It's like a lemon and cayenne pepper as a diet.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  That diet is designed for women only, right?  Only a woman has the kind of willpower.  Like, we don't make children.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, we can't actually have, like, cayenne pepper and lemon.  Can you explain that though?  That's all they drink.  They don't need anything else, right?  A little syrup too, right?  Yeah.  Like a little syrup as days go on.  There's not a guy alive that can survive that.  Survive that.  A woman, no problem.  The discipline involved.  Yeah.  When they want to look good, they can master cleanse.  Like, I was on liquids for a little while, but I was on the liquids I like. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Not the...  That was crazy.  Like, I did that for like two days.  Mm-hmm.  And I was like, nah, this is not...  Probably start hallucinating.  It's not for people.  Like, for humans.  You know what I'm saying?  Are you constantly thinking about nutrition and working out, or do you party and, like,  you know, kind of, you know...  I'm going to go out.  I'm going to go out.  It's a part of the lifestyle, you know, in the culture of music.  Right.  You know what I mean?  For you to be in the actual, the party or nightclub environment. 
[01:09:00]  Right, yeah.  So I'm out a lot, but I don't do...  I don't actually drink.  No.  No.  And what I do is I...  Did you stop drinking?  Yeah, I didn't actually drink when you saw me with the bottle.  Mm-hmm.  What I did was I...  So you never really drank?  No.  What I do is I take that first bottle, pour it to the people that are around me, and I  send it back.  Tell them to go give me ginger ale.  Oh, shit.  And they put it in that bottle, and they come back, and then I open the rest of the bottles  and do that.  I always did it out of habit, because even before my music took off still, because I had to 
[01:09:30]  be aware of what's going on around me.  Uh-huh.  That'd be sharp.  And it leaves people thinking that maybe I'm not paying attention.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because they see the bottle, and they see you partying, and you're looking.  Wow, everyone would have sworn that you went through your partying stage.  Yeah, well, my whole...  My whole...  It was an easy option.  Like, you could...  There's vices that were right in front of me my entire life, right?  And people would choose them.  It was visible.  Like, you could hit your knees on the church floor and pray it'd get better, or push the 
[01:10:00]  door to the liquor store and see where it'd get you.  You know what I mean?  Like, these things were right there.  Like, the liquor store and the church in low-income environments, you'll see them more commonly  than barbershops and beauty salons.  These are the things that people feel like a necessity when they don't have much to sustain  your appearance.  The instant gratification of looking good from time to time is the big up.  Right.  You know, the big point that you uplift is.  So, you'll see people in low-income areas and environments that can't really afford very 
[01:10:30]  much splurge on clothing.  Right.  Something that makes a statement.  At least on the surface, you're like, all right, at least I'm looking good.  I feel like shit, but at least I look good.  Yeah, we've got to stand.  Somebody didn't make it to the actual apartment this morning, so they just peed in the elevator.  We both got to stand in it, but because I have on Louboutins, I'm better than you.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, this is the thought process going on here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow. 
[01:11:00]  That's some honesty right there.  You never did drugs or anything?  No.  I stayed away from...  You stayed away from all of this stuff.  So many people got high around me.  It was an easy choice because I didn't have anything.  Like, I was raised by my grandparents, and my grandmother had nine children.  My mom was the one of nine children that got killed.  So, I came into the house as the first grandchild, the new number nine.  And when you got something new, it was when someone was finished with it.  It was like a hand-me-down type of situation.  So, even when I made the decision to go into the lifestyle that my mom chose to not choose welfare, 
[01:11:30]  that was the options were to choose welfare or to go and hustle for it.  Right, right.  You said it was easy.  Why isn't it not easy for a lot of people in your situation?  Well, if people are drugging and drinking around you, you said, oh, that was easy to blow all that off.  Most people would fail.  Yeah, most people would follow and suit with the things that go on around them  and kind of get into the things that everybody else was into.  But I was going through a process where I was making an adjustment. 
[01:12:00]  My mom hustled, but she substituted.  At a point, she substituted finances for time, but I was always a priority.  So, every time I saw her, it was Christmas.  Yeah, yeah.  I was like, well, your mother's here.  It's going to get me excited, and I go running downstairs or whatever.  It's because she always got something for me.  And when she passed, that stopped.  Right, right.  So, it was like I associated her with everything that was positive, everything that was nice. 
[01:12:30]  Well, yeah.  But because you weren't drinking or doing drugs, by no stretch of the imagination, we were a choir boy.  No, no, no.  You were out.  Everything else.  You were dealing drugs.  I fucked up every way I was supposed to happen.  You know what I'm saying?  And what happens is I go into the lifestyle that she chose to provide for me because everybody that I see that has that thing that's the symbol or representation of financial freedom.  Right.  It's from her life.  It's from the lifestyle that she chose that actually got in the mix where she gets killed. 
[01:13:00]  Mm-hmm.  How old was she?  She was 23.  I was 8 years old when she got in.  Wow, wow.  You know, and at 15, at that point, teenage pregnancy wasn't as common as it is now, so we didn't have the programs that we made adjustments and put in place now.  At that point, you would have to—a teen was only eligible for work during the summer months when they received the blue card that was considered your working papers.  And your other option was welfare. 
[01:13:30]  Right, right.  You know, public assistance.  So she just went in another direction on it because public assistance wasn't the right option.  Do you remember when you started, like, you got into that life and, like, the first hunk of money you made that was a lot more money than most people around you had?  I accumulated it.  Oh, over time?  Yeah, it was like—but it felt like a huge hunk of money.  Like, when you got $300, like, that you got in, like, you're, like, $12, like, you got $300 on the side of the house. 
[01:14:00]  That was a huge chunk of money.  I used to take it, put it in a brown paper bag, and pull up the—you know how the house has shingles on it?  Mm-hmm.  Like, on the side of the house, pull it, and push it up under the—put it on the side of the actual house.  But $300 at that point, that was, like—  That's a lot of money.  Yeah, that was, like, $30,000 right now.  I was, like, I have $30,000 on the side of the house that nobody knows about.  Holy shit.  I'm big, baby.  Yeah, no shit.  What finally got you out of that?  Well, I mean, I just had a bigger idea than the environment that I was in. 
[01:14:30]  Like, the roof of what I could do on a financial end changed.  Mm-hmm.  You know, before, like, it felt limitless because the people that you see had—when I made that financial freedom statement,  they had Bonnefils, Cadillacs, Regals, all the things that were symbols of success.  You know, and jewelry and the ability to do exactly what they wanted when they wanted.  Mm-hmm.  It was representation of—it's that thing that we love within all our heroes, the rebel within their character, 
[01:15:00]  that they just do it the way they want to do it.  Mm-hmm.  And you look at them, and you're like, so you really just do this shit?  Like, you just do whatever the fuck you feel, huh?  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're like, shit, I want to be like that.  I don't have to go.  So my grandfather was representation of the traditional way.  Yeah, working and—  Yeah, and, like, my grandmother was to create a serene space for him to escape the pressures of the work environment. 
[01:15:30]  And he was to provide financial support and be the head of the household.  Mm-hmm.  And I saw that, but it was like—damn, like, I looked at him like, you got the hardest job ever, right?  Yeah.  Like, you go—he would come home, like, on payday, give her the money, take his money, then he goes back and forth to work with again, and just look.  And that was just supplying the—  That was it.  The money.  Yeah, it was like, yo.  To keep the machine going. 
[01:16:00]  What kind of job did he have?  He worked for GMC.  Okay.  He worked there for a long time.  Like, they put the car together, do all that kind of stuff.  And I would see him, like, come in, and he—it was interesting, because there was a lot of alcohol abuse.  Yeah.  Around, like, in the actual house.  Even my aunts and uncles went through phases where they actually drunk and did different things.  Once they reached that point that they were the legal drinking age, they got involved in it, and it was like everyone had different demons. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Like, one of my uncles would—he had this really angry guy that was in the bottle, that every time he drunk it, he would come out.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Like, you know the guy at the bar that wants to fight after he has a couple drinks just because?  Like, it's like, what the fuck are you looking at, asshole?  Oh, man.  It's like, wait, so the drink told you to say that?  It wasn't even him.  Like, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We kind of all know someone like that.  Yeah, be a muscle.  Yeah, like, it's just that.  Like, my uncle would be that.  I'd be like, oh, man.  Do you look at things, though, like, okay, that lifestyle your grandfather had and your grandmother, that really is kind of the American way of doing things. 
[01:17:00]  Do you look at that as, like, why aren't more young people doing that, though, working and stuff?  You know, the times have changed people.  They feel like they have different options.  With options come confusion.  Is it different options?  Or there seems to be this feeling that you are entitled to more. 
[01:17:30]  Like, I want more than just working to support a family just so I can make more money to go to work.  Like, they want more things.  And the roles have shifted.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you have women in the workspace that earn more than the men.  Yeah.  So, now there's that thing where a guy can actually be caught because he's like, no, I want a partner.  If we break up, you want half of the money, right?  Yeah.  You want half of everything that I own, right?  So, I want a partner. 
[01:18:00]  I know you.  I don't care if you help clean up behind the kids, too.  You do that.  And you be my partner.  You're going to have, they have high expectations in women on some levels.  And then, from the male perspective, even if you still practice.  I think women create a plan men don't create.  Early on.  You know how, like, when you're young, like, what are you going to be when you get older?  They have that whole family-orientated plan at the same time. 
[01:18:30]  Men, our plan is financial.  So, you go, I'm going to be a doctor, a lawyer, or I'm going to be in sports, or the things that you're passionate about.  You figure out what category or area you want to actually be in.  But it all relates to finance, like, even the toys.  We get a little girl.  Before you know it, she has a baby as her toy when she's a baby.  A dollhouse, a cooking set.  We're teaching the nurturing subconsciously.  So, her plan is, oh, I'm going to go to high school. 
[01:19:00]  I'm going to go to college.  I'm going to college.  And when they're married, I'm going to have three kids.  I'm going to have a boy and two girls.  Or two boys and a girl.  Like, she'll create that thing, whatever, in her head.  Or she says, I want to have a lot of kids.  But there's a timeline between when these things are supposed to happen in her actual head.  And as life starts to actually go on, and those things don't happen, and those time frames, you start to see interesting things out of people.  Because this plan was made so long ago. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, like, they start to compromise and fuck guys like me.  Exactly.  That's exactly what we're talking about.  Jesus.  You've got a fascinating story.  You said something.  I'm amazed that you weren't dragged completely down.  Well, you know what?  You did your time, but then you got out of that shit.  You didn't want that lifestyle that you saw around you.  Exactly.  There's a higher probability that you stay in the cycle.  Mm-hmm.  Of things that's going on.  Yeah, the odds were completely against you. 
[01:20:00]  Against it, yeah.  Because it's just a lot.  That's just the regimen of how things go.  And then when I decided I was going to write music for a living, it was like, you're going to write music?  Like, rap?  Mm-hmm.  Come on, man.  They didn't believe that.  They was like, you got to be.  About what?  What you going to rap about?  Mm-hmm.  Like, these are all people that are connected and involved with me in that lifestyle.  You're talking about people that should be supporting that.  Yeah, right.  They're like, what?  What?  What are you going to rap about? 
[01:20:30]  So we're going to rap about the shit we were doing.  But it seems like everyone on the street that's hustling is also, like, an aspiring rap artist.  Now.  In some way or another.  Right now.  Because they have examples of a person, like, it's raising the roof.  It's going further than the expectations of the environment.  So it's like, when they look and they have representation of people that go up, even, like me now,  I think my success is more important than I sustain being successful because I will come representation of hope.  For people in situations that are bad situations, they look at it and they have someone in front of them that they can say, well, look at what he went through. 
[01:21:00]  But don't you also feel that a lot of people think that there's that portion of thug life that you need to go through to make your music real?  But instead of it naturally occurring, they're just deciding, well, I'll just be a thug for a while and then I'll be able to make this music.  Well, we do have people who make wrong decisions.  Like, you got fools out there, right?  Right, right.  You don't actually have to have those criterias, like, as a part of your experience to create something. 
[01:21:30]  If we're going to consider music an art, an art form, then we can say you can create it from whatever perspective.  When we look at hip-hop culture, almost 90% of it is telling you things that don't directly relate to the experience.  You said something really interesting, too, which was not typically what would be associated with hip-hop.  Obama came out with his statements about gay rights and stuff.  And I want to make sure I get your quote right, where you said something like about gay marriage, I've encouraged same-sex activities, I've engaged in fetish areas a couple of times, I'm for it. 
[01:22:00]  Which is not a typical response from a guy in hip-hop.  Right, but you know what, if you've kind of encouraged two women to be in the same space.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the smile.  You know, I mean, like, it's a good smile you got right there.  Personal fetish or interest in having that thing go on.  Right.  And then they decide to have that thing happen without you. 
[01:22:30]  Actually, it's not even real.  You're not experiencing a menage if the two women aren't attracted to each other.  Mm-hmm.  You just have two women in a room.  Yeah.  Kind of just doing you a favor or doing it.  Yeah, well, it doesn't even.  It's just not it.  It's not it.  But still not the worst thing that could happen.  No, it's not the worst thing that could happen.  It's just simple man's thinking, right?  Why is menage a big fetish, right?  Because what's better than one good woman?  Two.  Simple thinking.  The only thing better than the experience of one good woman could be the experience of two maybe. 
[01:23:00]  You know what I'm saying?  I think it makes you feel badass, too, because if you could satisfy two women, you are fucking, you're the man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, even if it required a blue pill.  Oh, God.  Is there anything better than those?  Dude, I take a Cialis before I go to dinner with a girl.  Before dinner?  Absolutely.  Just to get ready.  You got it.  Glute pills are the best, man.  That's your vitamin, right?  That's Jimmy's vitamin.  That's my multivitamin.  Is that in the book?  No, it's not in the book.  Exactly.  You do kettlebells and drop a Cialis and go out and meet somebody. 
[01:23:30]  We're running out of time.  They're telling us he has to go.  That sucks, man.  We're just getting started.  We love when you come in.  Yeah, man.  Have a good time every time.  Yeah.  It's a blast.  Formula 50.  And I've been looking at all the pictures, and you've got kettlebell stuff in here.  You've got like playing.  It's like not typical stuff that you see.  It's like a lot of, like I like the side plank and that, what's it called?  The regular plank you do here?  Yeah.  The abdominal area.  Growing up, did you just have good genetics physically as far as that?  Oh.  Jimmy. 
[01:24:00]  I was always kind of thick.  I always was stocky.  Was it muscles, or was it like, oh my God, if I let this go, I'm going to be like this  guy in the booth over here.  I trained it into muscles.  Originally, I was like a chubby kid.  Yeah.  Oh, he was pointing at E-rock.  Yeah, exactly.  He was pointing at E-rock.  He's a farm animal.  He has no desire to work out.  But you have the base, though, for a good build, right?  Yeah, I trained because early on, I had gotten into, like, they tried to get me into group  activities and sports and stuff like that, and then I ended up playing, like, I ended 
[01:24:30]  up boxing in the boxing gym, so that was one of those sports that you can't blame it  on anyone.  Yeah.  It's just you in there.  You do it, or you put the work in, and you've got to perform on your own.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  Cool, man.  Okay, Formula 50 is the book.  At 50 Cent on Twitter.  You're very entertaining on Twitter.  Yeah, absolutely.  I keep it going.  Look at this.  We're getting our Instagram popping right now.  Oh, man.  Jimmy gets a good picture with Phoebe right there.  Very cool.  Nice. 
[01:25:00]  All right, man.  All right, so we're going to break?  Yeah, let's take a break.  Thanks, man.  Phoebe, you're fucking great when you come on here.  A lot of fun.  Right on.  Yeah.  On the next American War Stories.  Battleground.  Iraq.  Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant realizes no man can prepare for  war.  We thought we were going to starve, so we brought little bars and stuff.  There's going to be no food.  There was more.  I gained 30 pounds in Iraq. 
[01:25:30]  There was.  You go to the buffet, there's Chinese food, mac and cheese, barbecue, pizza, ice cream.  You can walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and Sundays as you want.  But no matter how rich the rewards, every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there.  I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more. 
[01:26:00]  So tune in as we chronicle the victories and the defeats for American hero, Bob Kelly.  I broke my knee, man.  On the next American War Stories.

[01:27:30]  Yeah, he's a really, he's a very nice dude.  And because of him, I'm blowing off the brown sugar from my oatmeal today.  He inspired you.  He inspired me to throw the brown sugar away.  And I was actually, I really was looking through his book and liking it because, uh...  Why does he have to make a scene every time he shows up?  He's nervous.  You all right?  Oh my God.  He looks like a cop from Fargo.  Get that hat and the glasses on?  Why do you always have to make it a thing?  Can't you just say, hey, I'm here?  My uncle used to say that to me. 
[01:28:00]  Huh?  What?  I was going to make it a thing.  Make it a thing.  You look like a cute little animal with your furry hat.  It's got little ears on it.  It's cold in New York and Bobby's dressing the part.  Yeah, I don't care what I look like.  Why do you have to dramatically go up to the window and you have to have the fingers and  everything?  Why can't you be like, hey, what's up?  Well, let's get into that.  I'm insecure.  Every time I leave the studio, I feel like our friendships end and they have to be rebuilt  the next time I'm in here.  Did I write you after your last appearance and say, hey, Bobby, that was fun? 
[01:28:30]  We had a good time?  Yes, you did.  All right.  And that made me feel good.  All right.  And then that died when you never wrote me again.  Well, I was waiting for you to write me, I think.  Oh, is that headquarters?  Let me see whose turn it is.  How's the pregnancy going for your wife there?  Everything good?  Yeah, we just, yep, everything's good.  How many months are you up to?  20, 21 weeks.  Oh, all right.  Will you allow me to read what we texted back and forth?  I don't know if I have a choice in that. 
[01:29:00]  What did you write?  Edgar.  I wrote, I wrote, and this goes back to Sam, so stay.  I wrote, good seeing you today, pal.  Well, Bobby wrote, you bro, I should have left with you.  That lady is a yapping cunt.  And then I wrote, I hated her, and I wish I stayed.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of people bitched about that lady.  Hated her.  From the millionaire matchmaker, whatever the fuck.  I fucking hated her.  Why didn't you fucking attack her? 
[01:29:30]  Yes.  They all had lots of opinions, didn't they?  Everybody was talking about it, weren't they?  How much she sucked, and I fucking talked about it.  I hung out for a little bit, and I couldn't get a word in, so I'm like, you know, fuck  it.  But now I wish I did stay, because the audience hated her.  She was terrible.  Bobby hated her.  You couldn't get a word in.  What's her name?  I went home and smacked my wife right in the face.  Patty Stanger.  Patty Stanger?  The millionaire matchmaker.  She's a bit full of herself.  A bit.  A bit full of herself.  Yeah.  She fucking talked and talked and talked.  She's sorry.  With her stupid duck lips.  I was annoyed with her.  The next day, I was still kind of pissed off. 
[01:30:00]  You were still annoyed?  And it's not fair, because she's not here, but we're bringing it up because of what happened  just with you, with the text messages.  I forgot all about this.  I came in the next day, or next week, and someone was just yapping.  Who was that?  What guy came in the next week and was just talking?  Oh, it was the boxer.  Oh, yeah.  Bernard Hopkins.  And I was looking at Bob because he's talking.  Because he wouldn't say anything about Bernard Hopkins.  I didn't mind that.  But at least Hopkins is.  You'll sit there and be nice.  Me and Anthony both sit there.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm just nodding our heads for fucking 45 minutes.  Yeah, man.  While he rhymed shit.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like, oh, boy.  He stood up.  He was touching Jimmy.  He made everybody uncomfortable.  Were you guys touching Jimmy?  You know who else touched me?  Fitty.  Fitty.  I saw that.  Fitty was right on the balls.  You missed 50 Cent, man.  He was great.  I listened.  It was actually a great interview.  Yeah, Fitty was cool, man.  People like to touch me.  My arms.  He was a fascinating girl-like guy.  Because it feels like a stress doll ball.  Sam, why wouldn't you attack?  Yeah, you would do.  Why wouldn't you attack that lady? 
[01:31:00]  That's not my style.  I know it's not your style, but when it's so obvious.  You don't have a style yet.  Shut up.  Exactly.  I'm developing a style.  You don't.  Why don't you talk about my style?  Why don't you just go, will you shut the fuck up?  Exactly.  The whole audience was begging.  Make that your style.  Sometimes you just got to do the obvious, though.  It's not my show, though, and I didn't want to snap and say something and fuck up.  I know he's getting guests now.  Next time, we all give you permission to snap.  A bitch like that?  Is that good?  Yeah.  That's good, right?  She needed to be knocked down a couple of notches.  Thank you very much. 
[01:31:30]  What is her deal?  Plus, then Ant gets to call in.  Yeah.  Furious.  I was livid.  Screaming fucking bitch.  I was livid.  I had to call.  Just a little lesson.  I know it's not your style, but sometimes, man, it's the obvious.  What style?  She was yapping.  I do have a style.  And you were like, oh, you were into it, too, with everything she had to say.  Well, of course, because then people keep talking, and eventually they say some dumb shit.  Is your style the guy that lets a bitch walk all over you?  Oh, if that's your style, then it's your style.  Let some fucking bitch that thinks she's fucking a lot more famous than she is step on you. 
[01:32:00]  A good style.  I like letting them talk.  You just let people talk.  Can we get her on the phone right now?  I don't know.  Let's take care of this problem.  She only deals with millionaires.  That's what she said.  I don't deal with people who have to do payment plans.  I don't like payment plans.  That's why I do millionaires.  Really no boyfriend having fucking bitch, and there's a reason for it?  Does she have a boyfriend?  50 fucking years old.  You have a promise ring.  Yeah, she has a promise ring from somebody right now.  At 50.  What's a promise ring?  It's pre-engagement.  She's not ready, Opie. 
[01:32:30]  No, that's a guy going, I'm going to fuck you for a little longer until I can't take it anymore,  and then I'm out.  And I don't want to lose the cost of a real ring.  So you're worth this much.  I made this with string.  Yeah.  Put this around your finger, you fat bitch.  Look, we got Jon Jones and Chael Sonnen coming in any moment, but I want Roland to get her  on the phone.  Let's take care of this.  Roland.  Can we take care of it after the Jon Jones-Chael Sonnen interview?  Yeah, of course.  Do it, Roland.  Don't touch me, Edgar.  She loves the attention, so she'll fucking call our show, no problem.  Yeah, but she lives in LA, so it's actually, she might not be up because it's... 
[01:33:00]  Really?  What's she so busy doing?  Yeah, good question.  You're right.  She's probably just talking right now.  Cut!  She probably talks in her sleep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, just self-promoting, bitch.  I understand wanting to self-promote, but Jesus, give us a little something else.  It's amazing the things you'll hear on After Opie and Anthony Live.  It's unpredictable.  Nice plug.  Yeah, but that wasn't Opie.  That was actually the Bob and Sam show.  Well, we go Sam and Bob, usually.  The Bob and Sam show.  I was more of the guest.  It doesn't matter who's Sam.  Even when I'm on, it's kind of the Bob and Sam show.  Hey, how many months are you up to now? 
[01:33:30]  Six?  Five and a half?  Five-ish?  No, June, right?  It's June 2nd.  June 2nd.  No smoking?  February, March, April, May, June.  No smoking?  I haven't smoked in a year and a half.  Oh, I thought that was who he was asking.  I haven't smoked.  Yeah, I haven't smoked.  No, how many?  The baby.  The baby.  So you're half done?  It's flying by, man.  A little more than half done.  It goes by faster than you fucking think it does.  You don't have any baby stuff in the house yet, though.  We don't need it until the last minute.  No, we don't have it yet.  You're going to have a baby shower? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, she's having one.  And we're doing that.  What is it called?  A registry on Amazon?  I guess you send out to people.  What are you doing?  You're getting all that crap.  It's a lot of shit, man.  You're going to get a lot of crap you'll never use.  Really?  Is that what happens?  Yes.  Like, what do you mean?  I don't know.  Give me some stuff and I'll tell you.  Are you going to get a baby carriage?  You want that fucking electric one, don't you?  I want that push button.  Yeah, but...  You need the baby carriage.  Yes.  They have a $1,000 one.  You push a button, it closes.  You don't need that.  And it charges your iPhone. 
[01:34:30]  Charges your iPhone.  Yeah, it does.  It does.  Bobby and his gadgets.  The wheels run a little generator that charges your iPhone.  You don't need that.  Yeah, but why don't you need that?  You're supposed to be playing with your baby and talking to the baby going, hey, guccio,  guccio.  I'm going to laugh when you put your place up for sale because you have too much shit  in there.  Man.  You're in trouble, man, with the gadgets.  Yeah.  And I don't have that five-bedroom like you.  I have a one-bedroom duplex. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, man.  Well, why don't we look at your registry?  I'll tell you right now what you need and don't need.  You can fucking X some of that shit right off.  Well, most of it's clothes.  Like onesies, I guess they're called.  Onesies.  Onesies.  And then I didn't know there was a...  I told Anthony last week there was a diaper.  It's a diaper trash can.  It charges your iPhone.  It's a diaper.  You need that.  It's a diaper barrel.  Trust me.  You need that.  But it actually...  As you close it, it seals the diaper in another compartment.  And then you open back up and it has... 
[01:35:30]  It's like clean.  So it's like a clean barrel every time and all the shit diapers are underneath.  Yeah.  And then you open it when you're depressed and you just breathe deep.  It's like a little secret to cheer you up.  Sea secret.  My God.  All right.  In case you have an erection difficulties.  Well, I don't know why we laugh at a pedophile.  Oh, God.  That sounds all right.  What the fuck is wrong with us?  When we were growing up, our parents would fucking wash the diapers.  They had cloth diapers.  Yep.  And they would have to wash the shit out of them so we could wear them again. 
[01:36:00]  Well, you can actually...  Those are coming back in.  I can't even imagine.  No.  They're not coming back in.  Just a couple fucking environmental assholes are doing it.  That's it.  Who would deal with that shit?  I actually watched...  I had to watch a video the night.  How to wipe...  Ugh.  How to wipe a baby's asshole.  What?  How to change a diaper.  Yeah.  Why do you have to watch a video for that?  Because I want to know how to do it.  I just don't want...  No, it's not common.  How's it?  It's common knowledge.  Really?  It's common knowledge for some people in this room. 
[01:36:30]  I'm sorry.  Shit.  It's common knowledge.  What do you have to learn?  It's not common knowledge.  There's duty all around the asshole and underneath the balls and you fucking clean it up.  Or vagina.  I'll tell you.  You have to keep the peepee covered because you'll piss in your face.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  That's not common knowledge.  Oh, you got the peepee covered?  I would have just whipped out...  That's a waste.  Like a tea coat.  It's called a peepee teepee.  What is that?  Peepee teepee.  What is that?  It's called a teepee peepee something.  Yeah, they're like the things you drink out of in the gym.  The cups.  It's a little teepee that you put on the little baby penis so they don't pee on you. 
[01:37:00]  Can't you just get one of those little fucking paper cup things?  It's a dumb fucking waste.  Can't you just put your mouth over it?  Oh, God.  That's what you're into, Bobby.  And then the girls, if you have a girl, you have to wipe from the front to the back so you  don't put shit in her vagina.  Right.  I'm cleaning vaginas now.  It's very strange.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of different folds.  God damn it.  Because they have like chubby, foldy legs that lead to the chubby fucking foldy vagina.  It's probably like a fat chick. 
[01:37:30]  I bet fat chicks are exactly like that, right?  You know what?  They got like baby vaginas.  You know what?  Baby vaginas look like fat chicks.  Same exact thing except they don't have the dead skin on the side of their legs from  rubbing together for six years.  Fucking water buffaloes.  There's a fucking...  I want to see the list of shit that you're not going to need.  Yeah.  Are you...  Are you glad you had...  Diaper genie.  I know you're glad that...  Diaper genie, yeah.  Are you glad you had the second...  Is it worse now that you had the other one?  Second is...  Second is... 
[01:38:00]  Wow.  Holy fuck.  Harder or easier?  Harder.  So much to do every fucking day.  And you already got through it and you got in that schedule and you were like, okay,  this kid's sleeping.  He eats and plays.  Yeah, man.  I got two relatively easy kids, but still out of fucking work, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Why?  You're one and done?  I think I'm one and done, yeah.  I think I'm going to...  You're a one and done type of guy.  You'll be all right.  Yeah.  Where's fucking John Jones?  I don't know, but these guys are going to hear it for walking in late.  That's right. 
[01:38:30]  What are you going to say to them?  Get the fuck out.  Dude, put me in a chokehold, please.  Dude, I'd love that.  Did you ever have Chael do it?  No.  No, Chael's...  We've never interviewed Chael.  Really?  Bobby, I got to say, one of my favorite videos I filmed was you getting choked out by John  Jones.  To this day, it makes me laugh so fucking hard, man.  My little hummingbird fucking tap.  And people get pissed off at John Jones because they all know that he held that hold a little  too long.  You think so?  Just a tad.  A little bit.  I felt my neck...  I heard my neck cracking.  That's what scared me.  I thought he was actually snapping my spine.  But it makes me laugh fucking hard, man. 
[01:39:00]  I just pictured me on the ground, not being able to move.  Were you guys laughing for around 10 minutes?  It was great.  I can't move.  It was a good one.  How's Dawn feeling?  She's great.  Everything's good.  Everything's great.  I don't think she's going to have any stretch marks.  Yakking in the morning?  Nope.  She didn't even get morning sickness.  No?  Is she putting that cream on?  Yeah, but she's an esthetician, so she knows all the creams.  You've got to cream that shit up, and guess what?  No stretch marks.  Yeah, she's got all this cream every day and night.  I remember I dated a girl smoking hot.  I mean, smoking hot. 
[01:39:30]  And then she had a kid.  I guess she didn't cream her belly or something.  And her stomach.  It looked like it melted.  Oh, my God.  It was just a smoking hot chick with this belly that you could shape into different faces.  Fuck.  Yeah, when I was fucking gross.  When I was putting up numbers, I had a lasagna belly or two.  Oh, God, yeah.  Fucking brutal.  I think they know more now, though, as time has gone on, like the last 20 years.  It's brutal.  It looks like, you know, one of those terrain maps.  You know what I mean?  Like the army uses to fight the Germans. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And I guess it's gross.  If you cream up that shit, it helps a lot.  It's all you have to do is you have to cream it up.  There's certain creams you rub on.  Could you say cream up that shit?  Cream up that shit, kid.  And, yeah, the girls.  But some girls are prone to get stretch marks, too.  Yeah.  Some girls just get it.  It's got to be a type of skin, maybe.  It's a type of body.  A type of skin.  Yeah.  It's those girls that have fucking A-cup tits but still have stretch marks on the side  of them.  Those girls are going to be predetermined. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, I know.  It's like, oh, you're predestined.  They've never weighed over a buck ten and they have stretch marks.  Yeah, it's like, what the fuck happened there?  Jesus Christ.  Are you going to baby classes yet?  No, I'm not doing that.  You're not doing baby classes?  Why?  You'll take a class.  You'll look up diapers and say, why don't you take a baby class to help the baby?  Baby classes are easy.  I've got books and I'm YouTube and shit.  You don't have to.  But back, all that stupid shit, Lamaze, that's all bullshit.  Yeah.  You know what, Bobby?  You're absolutely right.  Yeah, I'm not doing that shit.  You throw all that shit out the fucking window. 
[01:41:00]  What, she not going to have the baby if I'm in there?  Right.  Are you going to do old school just to have a cigar in the fucking waiting room of the  hospital pacing back and forth?  My grandfather had eight kids, never once fucking went to the hospital.  He was just home.  Just send that shit home and it looks like me.  Fix that pussy.  That's it.  Waiting for the phone call?  Are you going to be in the delivery room?  I'm going to be, I already talked to her though.  And this is what blows me away is that a lot of times, a lot of guys that have, friends  of mine who have given birth say that you'll be in there, you don't want to look, and then  the doctor will go help me. 
[01:41:30]  Which, what the, like hold this leg up for me.  No, well.  He's just trying to make you feel useful.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what nurses are for.  Me and my, uh, me and my mother-in-law are a team when my wife's given birth.  You saw it.  I was told to stay up near the shoulders.  Yeah.  Took a little peek.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not taking a peek.  And you know what's really going to gross me out is the belly button falls off like two  weeks after it's birthed.  Oh, you're going to find a fucking Slim Jim around your house.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  My dog's just going to be chewing on something. 
[01:42:00]  It gets extremely dark and crispy.  And then it just falls off one day and then you got a nice little fresh baby.  You got to smell it.  There's around 17 of them around Anthony's apartment after a party.  Shut up.  You going to cut the cord?  No, I'm not cutting a cord.  You should.  It's very, it's very grizzly though.  It's funny too.  It's surprisingly very tough to cut.  You can have it through and you check it out and it's just bleep.  That'd be so funny.  He's just going.  And then you wonder, how the fuck is that inside a woman? 
[01:42:30]  What the hell?  They're aliens.  Yeah.  They're fucking aliens.  The, the, the, the placenta is what's the, I heard is the, oh, they deliver that after  you got to eat it.  When that flops out and the blood just gushes out and that thing flops on the ground like  a fucking Thanksgiving ham.  Right.  Some people, some people eat it.  Some people fucking bury it in their backyard to fucking.  Some people do it.  Yeah.  Will you eat it?  We have chicks twop like a little elevator from the Shining.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  I'm a fatso, Jim, but I'm not that fatso.  I eat that shit. 
[01:43:00]  I'm going to be in there starving.  Just give it to me.  Yeah.  Take a look at the placenta.  No.  It's fascinating.  You know, it's funny.  That's unbelievable.  You're like, how the fuck is this all in a woman?  I watched, like last night I watched Dana White's surgery, which is fucking atrocious.  What kind of surgery?  Oh, he got that, what is it, what's the disease he has where he fucks up his equilibrium?  Dana White?  Yeah.  You don't know.  What is it?  I heard about this surgery.  I forget.  Ask one of the fans.  They know.  What is it?  Did he get dizzy or something?  He fucks up his equilibrium. 
[01:43:30]  He gets, he can't, he gets headaches.  He has ringing, tendinitis, I think.  Tinnitus.  Tinnitus.  No, it's called Meninus.  Ah, fuck.  I can't get the name.  I'm sorry.  Meninus disease or something like that?  What?  He's got this crazy disease.  It fucks him up.  That's why he doesn't go to some of the shows.  Meninus.  Meninus disease.  Dana doesn't go to all the shows?  No, he has this disease that fucks him up and he can't fly.  You never heard him talk about this?  No, never.  No one can fly.  Exactly.  We're people, Bob. 
[01:44:00]  We're not fucking birds.  What, do you have wings implanted on him?  You can't cure it.  I guess this is the only way you can kind of make it better is this surgery that could  have, like, he would, might have been able to have to, like, learn to walk again.  Is it brain surgery?  No, it's behind the ear and they cut something or take some bone out or something like that.  It's on, the video's online.  Is it the hammer, anvil, and stirrup bone?  They literally cut the...  That's all I know about the ear.  I used to write...  I'll get it right now. 
[01:44:30]  Is it something with the cochlea?  The cochlea?  I used to get that one wrong all the time.  Yeah.  I used to write syrup.  Syrup.  Syrup?  I really did.  The hammer, the syrup, and the anvil?  Yeah, it was just stupid.  Can you find the video?  I got it right now.  It's so gross, this operation.  But the bloody stuff, that stuff fucks me up, but it does...  What makes me...  If my wife shits during the birth, I'm throwing up on the pussy.  They do that?  Women's shit, yes.  I don't have...  Snooki dead, I think, right?  If they don't go to Meniere's disease, Meniere, M-E-N-I-E-R, Meniere's, yeah, Meniere's disease. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, you didn't know he had that?  No.  No.  Yeah, he's...  I don't talk to him like you do.  Oh, man, I have tinnitus.  Oh, man, maybe I got that.  Please disable your ad blocker?  What the fuck?  Why is this computer?  That's a rare disease.  Oh, God.  Who else works here?  I like a disease that's well done.  I like a disease.  What is it?  What does it do?  What else does it do?  It fucks up.  It really fucks up your equilibrium. 
[01:45:30]  But, yeah?  Yeah, and you can't...  Why, are you thinking you got it?  Intense disease.  Oh, yeah.  Every time anything is mentioned on the show, we're all...  Intense dizziness?  That's why sometimes he doesn't go to events, because he can't fly.  He gets fucked up.  Lack of balance, hearing loss.  Yep.  They don't know what it is, but it's believed to be related to an increase in fluid pressure.  Fluid.  There you go, right here.  You ready?  You want to see this shit?  I'm not watching.  Why?  Turn it this way.  Because I can't watch surgeries.  I can watch surgeries.  I get sick.  But it does fuck me up.  What's up, everybody?  UFC 6 this Saturday. 
[01:46:00]  You want me to just get to the surgery?  Yeah, we don't need his fucking video blog.  I love his video blog.  It's good.  I don't mind it, but I want to see the surgery.  This is actually funny.  I've never seen somebody go out on anesthesia, and you see him trying to hold on, and his  eyes just roll back into his fucking head.  Watch this.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Pause this for a second.  I got a couple questions.  Yeah, go ahead.  How is he allowed to videotape his surgery?  Because he's Dana fucking White.  So he found people that said, fuck it, yeah, you can video?  Yeah, they're all in scrubs, and they're all clean. 
[01:46:30]  I know it's on the up and up, but a lot of times, they don't want this shit in the  operating room.  Oh, yeah.  This is crazy.  Watch it.  Let me see, Bob.  I can't see.  Turn the thing.  What does he do?  He just goes right out.  Watch.  He gives him the stuff.  Turn the monitor.  I can't see it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I can't see it.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Hang on.  I'm getting it cued up, stoop.  No, you got it about cued.  There you go.  There you go, Jimmy.  Let's see him.  Shut up.  I can't get it cued up while it's facing you, you fucking muffin.  Hit play.  What's what we're waiting for?  There you go.  Down.  There you go.  Right there.  Watch his eyes. 
[01:47:00]  He's being given some drugs.  And then he's like, it's not bad.  He's still okay.  He says waiting.  He's still there.  Oh, wait.  His face just...  He's burning.  Oh.  They're giving him a little more.  This is how easy it is to kill people.  They're giving him a little more.  Look, they're giving him three big fucking...  Here we go.  Here we go.  One, two.  Look at his eyes.  Oh, rolling. 
[01:47:30]  Drugs roll.  Oh, he's gone.  That's it.  Wow.  No, he's still hanging in there.  All right, here you go.  Drugs are the best thing.  They're taping him down.  Prepping his area behind his ear.  In front of his head.  Wow.  He almost got...  Oh, I am not watching this, motherfucker.  Oh, they haven't cut yet.  Okay.  There you go.  Look how sharp this fucking scalpel is.  I am not watching.  All right.  They're just doing light little slices, right? 
[01:48:00]  Wow.  Watch this.  Oh, fuck.  They're carving his ear out.  Nope.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Watch.  Oh, it gets worse.  Wow.  How the fuck do they know how to do that?  You know how many fighters would probably like to do that and yell at them?  Holy shit, man.  Oh, it gets worse.  Do you think that would hurt if he was awake?  What?  Watch this.  Listen.  Watch this.  Look at this.  This ain't bad.  That's not that bad.  Listen.  No, I'm not watching.  They're chipping bone. 
[01:48:30]  You can hear the chipping bone.  They're chipping the bone.  I get queasy when I see this stuff.  Oh, now they got fun.  That sounds like wood shop.  Is that the fluid?  Wait.  Oh.  That sounds like wood shop.  How are they not fucking up everything?  How are they not fucking up everything?  I said the same thing.  How do you?  If you.  They were just burning, drilling, cutting.  If you fuck up like in carpentry, you can just get another piece of wood. 
[01:49:00]  You can't get another piece of skull.  Imagine the pressure.  You're the guy that has to make sure you don't fuck this up.  Yeah, what's the end game with this surgery?  Yeah, what do they do?  Like draining flood?  It's supposed to help him out.  It's supposed to make it less.  No, it doesn't cure it, but it helps it.  I'm just stitching it up.  What does he just fucking feel like he spun around 80 times and he tries to walk?  Is that what he feels like?  Is that like all dizzy?  I want to get him on the phone.  Is that it really?  Like, you know, when you spin around, you try to walk, you're all fucked up?  Yeah, I think it's the ringing sound and he gets dizzy and it's just unbearable. 
[01:49:30]  What causes it?  Like, you're not supposed to do this surgery.  Look how perfect the fucking...  This surgery is very dangerous.  Like, he could have had to learn how to walk again.  What did they do?  By the way.  I think...  I don't know the...  I don't know.  You done?  You didn't see what they did?  You just saw him grinding shit away.  Dr. C. would tell us.  How long of the surgery is it?  Now look at him.  Watch the end, though.  The end is pretty rough.  Does he puke?  Nick the tooth.  What?  His friend, Nick the tooth.  Take this stupid thing off. 
[01:50:00]  That guy right there, he's like missing a front tooth.  Hold on that ear cup.  He calls him Nick the tooth.  What does he got?  He's the ear cup.  It's fucking gnarly.  It's taped to my forehead.  Yeah.  They stitched him up nice.  They stitched him up great.  Whoever did his surgery, you can't even see the scar.  Pretty funny.  Yeah.  How long ago was this?  Just wait.  This was last week.  Wow.  Oh, really?  I think last week.  Yeah, the week or two.  This is when...  Before Brazil.  This is where we unveil.  Here he is.  My Nick the tooth.  Could he find a fucking more frightening guy to pull his bandage off? 
[01:50:30]  I know, right?  Jesus.  Why don't you just yank it off?  The main thing is...  Elliot asked him if somebody's hands are clean.  I'm not.  He has a three years left.  The main thing is...  He goes...  Pull tape off of his head.  He goes, your hair is hands clean?  I just took a shower.  And then as soon as I did that, I took a shit.  Now I'm taking the bandages off as fuck.  You can feel the air.  Don't take the tape off.  There should be tape back there.  Yes, there is.  I'm just taking the dressing off.  Fucking...  Oh, my God.  God damn it. 
[01:51:00]  That's not bad.  He's just pulling the dressing off.  I don't care.  I don't like any of this stuff.  Wow.  That's giving me the heebie-jeebies.  As long as poo doesn't come out of his ear, I'm okay.  Five-year-old blood.  Why isn't he swollen?  Just be cool.  I guess you just don't smell in that area?  That's it, bro.  The cochlea.  That's where I cut the ear.  Right here.  And I removed it.  I pulled it off.  He's lying.  I dropped it a few times.  He's not even going to have a scar that you'll notice.  How does it feel?  It's behind his ear.  I dropped it a few times.  Oh, wow.  Is that crazy?  He still seemed kind of doped up there.  I'd love to know what they did to him. 
[01:51:30]  And how long of a surgery is it?  We might have someone that can explain the surgery.  Yeah, I can.  Dr. Stade.  Dr. Sani, it looks like.  Dr. Sani.  What about Dr. Stade?  Could you bring me a gift?  Sani.  Oh.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hi, this is Dr. Sani.  I'm a few-nose-and-throw.  And basically, with this many of these, it's in your ear.  Your ear is actually how your body can balance you.  So when you're walking upright, the way you know what is upright, what is left, what is  right, your ear has these little canals in it, semicircular canals. 
[01:52:00]  You have these little crystals called otoliths.  And the otoliths are in liquid.  So imagine like a little bit of crystal that's inside of a liquid.  If you turn the liquid one way, the crystal will move up.  If you turn it the other way, it'll move down.  And that's how you know what is up and down.  These people that have these crystals that kind of disbodge from an accident or genetic  components have terrible balance.  Like they can get out of bed, the whole room is spinning, they have no idea what it is.  And it also affects the ear.  So like he was saying, it's called tinnitus, which is ringing of the ear.  They also have a difficulty of balance. 
[01:52:30]  And the last thing they have is sensory neural hearing loss.  So what we can do is we can do a certain sensory neural hearing loss.  What?  I just want to say, I'm a big fan.  You guys are amazing.  You make my support really good.  Thank you, buddy.  So what do they do?  So what do they do?  Yeah, how do they fix them?  What do they fix?  So there's various surgeries.  The biggest actually way to cure it, and you guys are going to be like, come on.  It's actually, you can do a soil restriction diet.  And you'll be like, what is that?  Well, that'll affect your fluid, the density of the fluid in the middle ear. 
[01:53:00]  That's the first thing you can do.  As a doctor, you always want to do least invasive, most invasive.  So the first thing you can do is fluid balancing and, like, cell restriction.  After that, we can do advanced ear surgery, cochlear surgery, where we actually go in and we try to reposition the crystal, the otolith, better in the ear.  Very advanced surgery where we go behind the ear where the mastoid is, you can drill, and you can go back into the semicircular canal and kind of reposition stuff.  So, you can actually become, have to learn how to walk again. 
[01:53:30]  It could, you know what I mean, after the surgery, it could go, right?  It's very risky surgery.  No.  His phone sucks.  I have no idea what he said.  It's risky, right?  No.  They get in there and rearrange the crystals.  What?  Oh, they're rearranging the crystals.  No.  All right.  What?  Oh, it's a poor phone.  All right.  Thank you, Sonny.  Thanks very much, Doc.  That happened when I smashed up the Mustang. 
[01:54:00]  I fucking took a big jolt and I was dizzy for, like, a week later while the crystals had to reposition themselves.  Yeah.  I hope you don't get that disease.  Like Superman's house.  Or the alcohol wear off.  Well, that's true.  Well, I compensated.  I figure if I'm dizzy naturally and then I drink, it equals it out.  The alcohol took two weeks to wear off.  We're going to take it rearranged with a crystal decanter at my bar and put it towards my mouth.  Yeah, decana.  We're going to do a quick break because these guys are on the way and we've got to do some live reads. 
[01:54:30]  John Jones and Chael Sonnen are next.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, we might have a couple minutes to do this.  Yeah.  Bobby informed us during the break that he had a taste test.  Yeah, on my podcast.  It's fucking sick.  One of my friends had a baby and his wife was gracious enough to donate some milk. 
[01:55:00]  And then we had almond milk, 2%, and breast milk.  And we all did a taste test.  And you know what the best milk was?  What?  Breast milk.  You're such a liar.  How did you not puke?  You're a liar.  How did you not go, bleep, bleep, bleep?  Because psychologically it was in milk.  You're a liar.  It tastes like the bottom of the cereal bowl when you do it.  That's how sweet it is.  No, no, no.  Honey grams.  That's good. 
[01:55:30]  It was so sweet.  I had breast milk ice cream.  Pat Duffy's sister had a baby.  Right.  So we made ice cream out of her breast milk.  Right.  It was some of the best ice cream I ever tasted for the first second.  And then it was completely horrific after that.  It tasted like sweat and moth balls and just stale.  It just tasted dusty.  My tongue swelled up.  Swelled up.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Swelled up.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:56:00]  You really liked it.  It tasted, because I thought it was going to taste fucking medicinal.  You know what I mean?  Like it was going to taste disgusting.  It was so sweet.  Sweeter than almond milk.  The whole way.  I am fucking scared.  Yeah.  I don't want a woman's sugar.  No.  You didn't get a second wave of taste that was horrendous?  No.  Wow.  Maybe the diet was different.  It's like some kind of cannibalism weird thing.  It's where you think fucking milk comes from.  Out of the bottom of a cow. 
[01:56:30]  I don't drink that shit either.  I'd rather drink it off of a human than a fucking animal.  No, you wouldn't.  Would you rather have human fucking steak than fucking cow steak?  That's a good point, Bob.  Wow.  Let's not get carried out of milk.  A pork chop instead of a fucking E-rock chop?  Wow.  He got you.  I'd rather have an E-rock chop.  I know.  You'll be full.  Can we drink your wife's breast milk?  No.  Bring some in.  I'll tell you why.  Because I got home, and my wife got really fucking angry at me for doing that.  She got mad.  Why?  Yeah.  I don't know.  She thought you were gay.  What? 
[01:57:00]  It doesn't even make sense.  I know.  It was a good shot, though.  Is it cheating?  You were cheating with someone else's breast milk?  It was a weird thing, yeah.  She was like, what the fuck are you doing?  Don't do that.  She got really angry.  Yeah.  She got mad.  She got mad.  I'm going to kick his fucking ass.  She never gets mad at that shit.  I'm going to kick this guy's ass.  He looks big.  Which guy?  Bring Chael's in and come in.  Here you go.  Chael's son of what the fuck fuck you up.  John's on his way.  Fuck you up.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  Hey, man.  Hey, Chael.  What's up, man?  Good to see you.  Take a seat. 
[01:57:30]  Anthony, Bob Kelly, Jim Norton.  How are you, man?  Nice to meet you.  Yeah, take a seat.  Take a seat.  Yeah, they said John's on his way, so we figured we'd just get you in first.  Oh, yeah?  You changed your Twitter pic.  Yeah, I did.  The other one was too creepy.  I like the one that was verified.  Oh, nice.  The mic falls out of the mic stand.  That was a gangster move by you.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm still verified, but I changed it.  I think it was creeping people out.  I don't remember what it was, but one of my photos.  Can we fix this mic?  It was a classic photo.  Sam?  It was.  It was good.  Yeah, pull that mic over.  What other mic were you using today?  We're actually on the air.  We're actually on the air, by the way.  Yeah.  And the smug, irritated look on your face as you held it up. 
[01:58:00]  That's what I wrote.  Oh, the verify.  Oh, you're right.  You're like verified.  Yeah, where you held the word verified.  Yeah, I was over my toilet I actually did that.  Oh, very nice.  I did not know.  I get over my toilet when I wrote verified on a bunch of things and just finally got  my...  Yeah.  Helped it up.  He did get verified after a while, so I guess it worked.  It's an oddly empowering thing when Twitter says that you are who you say you are.  It's not easy.  No.  I had to go through Dana.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, yeah.  Dana hooked me up. 
[01:58:30]  I was with the CMO of Tap Out, who's cronies with the CMO at Twitter.  Right.  And he wouldn't take his words.  He's like, look, I know I've known you a long time, but just because you say it's  him doesn't make it.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's pretty crazy.  Apparently they charge big money.  They charge...  I know one celebrity had to pay 15 grand to get verified.  Holy shit.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  Isn't there a way to do it?  Like your manager calls or something?  UFC ponied up a bunch.  Why?  Because the UFC can do it like that.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:59:00]  But I've always wondered how.  I went to the Twitter offices in San Francisco.  Oh, an AFAN.  I was doing a show there, and he was like, you want to come by?  And he let me come up and have lunch at the Twitter offices, and then he...  Did he get verified?  I go, can you verify me?  He goes, I'll see what I can do.  And then at the end of the week, I was verified.  But this was before when Twitter, when nobody knew what verified meant.  Yeah, sure.  By the way, we're all so much more important than you people out there.  I just want to let that out there.  We're verified.  You people aren't.  We laugh at you. 
[01:59:30]  We are live, yeah.  Oh, yeah, we're on.  Don't worry about it.  This is our show.  It's like we get much better than this.  We go.  We go.  Hello, everybody.  Isn't that great?  How it works?  It's a good thing you didn't say something that you might have regretted.  It is true.  It happens.  We were just watching Dana White's ear surgery.  Have you seen that video yet?  No, I haven't.  But I'm familiar.  Yeah, it gives me the heebie-jeebies.  I can't watch that shit.  I don't know how you learn how to do that as a profession.  I guess they do it on dead bodies first.  Yeah, but someone has to make that incision, and they can't fuck that up. 
[02:00:00]  He's such a soldier, man.  I contacted him when he was in the hospital.  I'm not watching it.  Because I needed something.  Business-related.  I contacted him.  He took the call.  Granted my request.  I hung up and found out where he was.  And I'm like, oh, jeez.  So I texted him.  I said, I am so sorry.  I didn't know where you were.  Good luck and all that.  Writes me right back.  No problem.  Still working.  Jesus.  Calling the next day just to check on him.  Now, I knew he wouldn't answer his phone.  He's very busy.  But I wanted him to at least see my name and his miscaller.  Let him know he was being thought of. 
[02:00:30]  He took the call.  He was on his way home.  With his bad ear, too, probably.  Headed to catch a plane.  Headed back to Vegas.  Unbelievable.  He's an animal.  Look at this thing.  Yeah, he is.  Oh, God.  I'm not watching that.  Drilling and burning.  You can't watch it either.  No, I'm not that guy.  I can't watch that shit.  You can do what you do, but you can't watch that.  That's so weird to me.  I can do neither.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we're really on.  Yeah, yeah, we are.  You still don't believe it, do you?  It's a very casual thing.  It feels like it's...  Look, the lights on behind us is on air. 
[02:01:00]  We do a very casual talk show.  Well, it's official then.  Yes.  It's official, I guess.  What are you weighing now?  Because you look a bit.  About 2.28, and I was just tipped off that Del Frisco's is making the best steak in New  York City.  Is that true?  Below us.  It's pretty damn good.  Including over Smith & Lewinsky.  The gentleman that I was with told me Smith & Lewinsky is actually good.  No, downstairs.  Downstairs is the best.  I like both, but yeah, Del Frisco is amazing.  I think Del Frisco is much better.  Porter House is much better than Smith & Lewinsky, too.  Del Frisco is just a nice restaurant overall. 
[02:01:30]  You should check it out.  I've been to a couple.  I just haven't been to one in New York City.  You got to watch what you're eating before a fight?  Yeah, but I used to fight at a weight class known as middleweight, which is 185 pounds.  Yeah.  I've now moved up 20 pounds, so I'll have a little less stress.  Is that a disadvantage?  Is that a disadvantage, like moving up?  Yeah, they're so close.  I don't think so.  Yeah, yeah.  You were faster at 185.  Now that you have that extra 20 pounds on, is that going to slow you down?  Yeah, and see what he said, it's not always a, size is not an advantage. 
[02:02:00]  It's a big misunderstanding.  Oh, okay.  It's a disadvantage.  I'll remind you that Muhammad Ali won the world title at 198 pounds.  Mike Tyson in his prime was only 220.  Right, yeah.  We just say the bigger guy is tougher.  I think that started on the playground when kids got beat up.  It was easier to explain to their parents, well, the guy was bigger than me.  But it's not a reality.  The smaller guy usually has a little bit of an advantage.  Yeah, you don't want to say this little fucker really kicked my ass at school today. 
[02:02:30]  185, not only are they strong and big, they're also fast as lightning.  Because you look at the 145s, they're fucking crazy.  They can literally do flips.  Yeah, they're crazy fast.  But then you go to 185 and they're fast and powerful.  And the heavyweights, I mean, some of these guys, are they walking at 260?  Have you seen the 125-pound class?  Jesus.  Yeah, it's lightning.  It's lightning fast.  It's like watching women fight. 
[02:03:00]  Because women just go in and fuck it.  They just start beating the shit out of each other and it's over.  And the little guys do the same thing.  Very exciting.  But it's hard to keep up with.  Like when you said, it's hard to see.  It's literally hard to see what they're doing.  It's so quick.  Oh, man.  What the heck just happened?  Are you worried about Jones at all?  I mean, I guess you're not because you're fighting him.  But, like, do you worry you're moving up a little bit?  And, like, he's a good fighter, man.  And you have no regard, like, you know, afraid of him at all.  Afraid?  I don't know if I would use that word. 
[02:03:30]  I acknowledge what you just said.  He's fantastic.  He's a very rare, rare talent.  You know, he's hitting moves out there that I can see.  But I don't know what the heck they're called.  I can never commentate his fight like Joe Rogan does because I don't know what it's called.  He's doing techniques that have never been done.  He's literally innovating on the spot, which is really rare for a sport that's been around this long.  Yeah.  To come up with new techniques.  How do you defend against something like that? 
[02:04:00]  His elbow punches are amazing.  Yeah, it leads with an elbow punch.  Like, you're on the ground, and his arms are so long, he's, like, punching with his elbow, which is just really awful.  He throws them on...  Sharp, long, skinny elbows.  Chris Rock elbows.  His last fight, he was actually throwing them standing up as a punch.  Oh, man.  Which was crazy.  He was just, like, uh...  How the fuck?  Yeah, like an actual jab hitting somebody.  He was hitting them in the chin with an elbow.  Yeah, like a Mars.  Which is crazy.  Two fights.  I believe you're referring to him.  He took on a gentleman named Rashad Evans. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, that's it.  You're right.  Rashad.  He actually almost knocked him out with an elbow standing up.  And then he hit him with another one.  And then another one.  Yeah.  Wow.  Weidman did that, too, his last fight.  He actually knocked somebody to clean the fuck out.  He sure did.  With an elbow standing.  Weidman's nasty.  He's an East Coast guy.  Yeah, he's out here.  His home got fucked up with Sandy.  Yeah.  Yeah, really bad.  His whole neighborhood.  Yeah, he's a big guy.  He hurt his knee, but he's coming back, too.  But not...  He wants Anderson.  He wants Anderson, yeah.  And I think he's rightfully the number one contender. 
[02:05:00]  I don't think he's the box office draw to make Anderson agree.  Right.  Which is unfortunate.  But I think Chris can fix that real quick.  Maybe jumps in there with Vitor.  Gets his name out there in a couple of main events.  He's like the Frankie Edgar type of personality.  Like that, you know, Bruce Springsteen.  Sure.  You know, I'm a blue-collar, hard-working guy.  Yeah.  Instead of like, you know, Anderson's just a fucking superstar.  Yeah.  I love that he called him on.  He knows how to speak English.  Yeah.  But then he kept speaking Portuguese, but now he speaks English all the time. 
[02:05:30]  He like...  He doesn't want to have to do any interviews.  He doesn't want to talk to anybody.  So as soon as it's time to do an interview, ah, I'd love to help you, but only Portuguese.  We had him in, and I was worried.  I'm like, are we going to be able to talk to him?  And he was fine with me.  Yeah, we did all right, right?  Yeah.  How fucked up is that that he just...  No, you're not a speak English.  Yeah, yeah.  Just called him up.  Is that going to be hard for you that you...  Now you're doing the show with John, you kind of became...  Not that you're pals, but you're more friendly than you were. 
[02:06:00]  And then Anderson and other people you fought, you've had this, not hatred, but this, you  know, angst against him to go in there and beat the shit out of him.  But now you guys kind of hang out.  You're doing press together.  Is that going to be harder for you to muster up the, you know, I'm going to beat the shit  out of you mentality?  It was a surprise.  I genuinely didn't like John Jones based on nothing, based on, you know, knowing him  through the media a little bit, seeing him around.  And man, I had him all wrong.  He's a very nice guy.  He's approachable. 
[02:06:30]  He's a hardworking, nice guy.  But no, I mean, competition's competition.  I will do everything I can to beat him.  He'll do the same thing back.  I won't hold it against him.  Shake hands and live with the result either way.  But yeah, you're right.  You know, I still, Anderson's, that's a tough one for me to swallow.  Yeah.  It really is.  Me and Jimmy were there.  Yeah.  Thank you for that.  I knew you guys were there.  Yeah.  We sat right behind your mom and it was, it was kind of, it was weird because we usually  go to the fights and just like, fucking kill him.  And we were rooting for you, but we, to look at your mom, it was like, oh my God, this 
[02:07:00]  is real.  Like this is, she was sad, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's life.  You know, she, she's been happy plenty of times too, but I mean, that's the way it goes.  Yeah.  It's, it's, it's sports.  You put it all on the line for sure.  Especially in this sport.  Yeah.  I sat behind a show guns.  I think a family when, I think when, when John beat him and there was people in his family  crying.  I mean, it was, it's like, oh yeah, there's a real person.  Oh, John Jones.  It's in the studio.  Hey.  How are you?  I'm doing good. 
[02:07:30]  Sorry guys.  That's all good.  That's a color people's time.  That's right.  50 Cent was here.  He actually was early today.  Oh yeah.  Okay.  Use that excuse.  It's fucking cold.  Definitely.  Did 50 Cent come through here?  Yeah.  It was cool as hell earlier.  He's done our show a couple times.  Is he going to start promoting boxing?  Is that right?  Yeah, he is.  Did you guys get into that with him?  Yeah.  No, we didn't ask.  He's promoting a workout book.  No, but he is.  But yeah, he's going to start doing that.  He's a fucking badass, man.  New company, TMT is, yeah, licensed boxing promoter.  Cool.  Doesn't he have like a, him and Mayweather were close and like now they're not close? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, that's fake.  That's so, you know, if you're going to do a media stunt, you can't do it as blatant as  him.  A 50 Cent who's generally pretty on top of a stunt.  I mean, what an insult he had for his audience to think anyone was going to buy it.  Well, apparently one guy did.  Yes, I certainly did.  I did.  I did.  I did.  I did.  I did.  I did.  You know, what a joke, hey, we're going to promote boxing and hey, let's get a fight  going.  We both have a bunch of Twitter followers.  Oh, man.  It's a joke.  It's like 50, you got to stop, man. 
[02:08:30]  People can be fooled, but you can't, you can't do it this blatantly.  Oh, Jimmy.  You sure look the fool now.  I really have a gullible ass.  I can't watch boxing anymore because of De La Hoya and they found those pictures of him  dressed as a woman.  I just, they're like a new show on FX.  Yeah.  Like, on fuel.  Yeah.  He's come up with something.  It's on fuel.  What is his final state?  I realize what had happened there, but what did he, did he say, listen, that's photoshopped  and I'm never going to do it again. 
[02:09:00]  No, he couldn't.  It's happened twice.  I'll tell you the genius of her attorney.  They were going to sue him for defamation because they were saying that she's saying  she's lying.  So her attorney said, oh, okay, we'll sue you for defamation for calling her a liar.  And then you're swearing under oath.  So they settled.  I don't think he's ever actually said it was just.  But officially he's still saying photoshopped.  So what was he wearing this time?  Yeah, it was.  Yeah, I know exactly.  I've masturbated to it twice.  I'll tell you off air what an ex-girlfriend told me once about him.  And wow, years, years, years before that came out. 
[02:09:30]  She told me something.  I was like, ah, she's full of shit.  She never fucked him.  I'm like, oh boy, I guess she did.  But in his defense, and granted, it's a little weird that he's cross-dressing, but that's  where it ends.  It's only a little weird.  We didn't commit a crime.  He didn't go hurt or humiliate.  Yeah, he's got a little egg on his face.  He's got a little fun with his chick or something like that.  Why not?  Getting around.  Yeah.  We don't really get it.  We've all slipped the girl's panties on at some point of another.  And he girls around like, oh, look how silly that looks.  Right, guys?  Yeah.  That's usually over your head or something. 
[02:10:00]  I've always seen sniffs of my head.  You guys wore them.  He might have taken it a little too far.  Holy fuck.  Well, you know what it is?  He's such an alpha male.  He's Oscar de la Hoya.  He's like, it's like, how do you, some people just like, the most submissive women sexually  are like dominant, smart women.  So he's a dominant alpha male.  It's like, that's where he probably lets go and just gives it up.  Thank God it was at the end of his career, though.  He needs a drink.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to be the boss in bed.  What if, well, you found out one of you guys was, you know, liked to cross-dress?  I mean, wouldn't you bring that up at the fucking press conference? 
[02:10:30]  I guess, but I don't really get, I don't know, I don't know that lifestyle with that  mean.  Like, what is it?  You just put on some women's clothes?  Whatever makes you feel sexy.  It would be funny if he pulled down his pants and he had some nice underwear on right now.  There's some fashions from around the world that I look at and go, man, I think that's  women's clothing, but that doesn't mean he's a cross-dresser.  Right.  It means he's a bad dresser.  Dutch men.  Dutch men underwear.  Dutch men, yeah.  Yeah.  They have those little silky.  How do you know?  Yeah.  Well, I went to Amsterdam a couple of times. 
[02:11:00]  Okay.  Well, it's not gay if you're just wearing the clothing, because Ed Wood said it made him feel  closer to women.  He's like, it just makes me feel, I like to wear women's clothes.  And the transvestite is different than the transsexual.  I don't want to dominate the whole interview, but we could really spend a long time talking  about this.  Very confusing.  Yeah.  Hey, John, Chell was talking about you and you guys getting along a little bit.  Is he a different guy than you thought he was going to be?  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely, man.  Chell's actually a pretty solid character.  When it's time for him to promote a fight, man, he's going to do a phenomenal job.  This guy will say whatever comes to his mind. 
[02:11:30]  And it was a style I wasn't used to at first, but I mean, I see some value in it.  You know, I actually watched my very first WWE show just like a few nights ago.  I watched it from the very start to the end.  And I was like, you know, let me take a little notes here.  You know, I think there's a little entertainment factor that our sport could use.  And so I think it's refreshing.  I agree with that.  Yeah.  The Rock is the shit.  Oh, I loved watching The Rock.  I was just watching the one when he came back recently. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  And he was talking to that MC Punk.  CM Punk.  Whatever.  The Rock's going to take a beating on Sunday at the hands of CM Punk, as a matter of fact.  The Rock is going down.  The J-O-B is coming to Phoenix.  You really think that he's going to beat The Rock?  It doesn't matter what you think.  He should beat The Rock.  I know he's better than The Rock.  You know what The Rock is thinking, my friend?  We'll see what happens.  The Rock is going to come into the stadium.  Oh, it feels masturbating.  And The Rock. 
[02:12:30]  You're on fire.  No, stop.  I like where you're headed with this.  It's just not me.  It's just not me.  It wasn't CM going to walk you in or something?  And Vince said, no, he was going to walk you in when you were fighting so much.  Yeah, in Chicago.  Well, I was going to fight Michael Bisping in Chicago, which is where Punk is from.  So yeah, CM was going to walk me in.  It was all set up.  That would be cool.  And Vince pulled the plug on it.  Oh, Vince pulled the plug.  Vince sees where UFC is.  So Dana allowed that, right?  Yeah, I was for it.  He probably does see it as a competition and stuff.  That's too bad. 
[02:13:00]  Maybe if I could own your name.  If I own your name, I'll let you go.  It would be.  I wouldn't mind making a guest appearance on there sometime.  WWE?  If they don't mind my chicken legs.  I got the upper body.  You guys both got called out by Vito the other night, right?  After he beat Bisping?  We did.  Yeah, you called that.  You both got called out.  I mean, he called out.  He wanted you, but he basically called you out too.  But you took a picture of you.  I think it was in like a Hilton Suites extended stay. 
[02:13:30]  Because I noticed the little magnets on the door, like I have a dog magnet.  How many hotels do you stay at?  Oh, dude, too many.  I know.  I was like, I think I stayed in that room.  I found it hilarious.  My buddy caught a perfect picture of a genuine laugh.  I didn't even take him seriously.  At no point in time was he close to winning that fight outside of that arm bar.  And I mean, that was the first minute of the first round.  And outside of that, it was a 24-minute butt whooping.  So I'm just like.  And the ultimate irony is he lost by an arm bar. 
[02:14:00]  He keeps talking about the arm bar he almost had, but he lost by an arm bar.  I was just like, man, don't call me out like that.  You talked to Chael with that.  Yeah, it was a little bit confusing.  Yeah.  They called him a champion.  He was a champion versus champion.  Right.  And he was like.  It's so funny to watch.  Chael, he does the after show.  And he goes from you're a great announcer.  You're really one of the best announcers on the show.  But then you go into your character in the show, in and out of it, flawlessly. 
[02:14:30]  And you turn to the camera.  You had a rhyme.  And you just snapped on Vito.  And then we're right back.  I really appreciate that.  This is actually blown away.  John and I do these things all the time.  But we're very seldomly with actual fans.  Just guys that play like fans.  So this is pretty refreshing, guys.  I'm going to tell you.  I mean, you're even watching the few old post shows.  Nobody does that.  I mean, that's outstanding.  That did not come out right.  Plenty of people watched the post show.  I just met not a lot of guys that we speak to in this atmosphere.  They never used to have that.  And that's the best way, if you don't know the sport, to become a fan of the sport is to watch the pre and post shows. 
[02:15:00]  Because that's where you guys give all the information.  They do it with every other sport.  They never did it with UFC.  You saw the fight and that's it.  And now that they do it, it's fucking great.  Because you learn about fighters and things that you really didn't know about.  Yeah.  You know, yeah.  And they have, he just, you're on UFC Tonight, too, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is, it's hard to get fighters who can speak.  I'm not, how do I say this?  Will I get my ass kicked? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  No, we get it.  We know what you mean.  Who can speak well in front of a camera.  That's a hard job to do.  Have some personality.  Yeah, but have personality, but also read a teleprompter, write some stuff and speak  flawlessly and go through the, some guys you can see that, you know, this is their last  time going to be on this fucking show.  This is a one and done for, because he stuttered through, but Chael is flawless.  And then the girl, too, what's in him?  Karen's really good, too. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, I appreciate that.  And Ariel Hawani is.  Ariel's great.  I love Ariel.  Ariel's great because Ariel created a job for himself.  If you guys know who this is, he was actually just voted, the same place where John won  for the second year in a row, fighter of the year, Ariel for the second year in a row,  won reporter of the year.  But this guy got a journalist degree out of college, started his own website, and just  stayed after it, just created a job.  And next thing you know, he's a right-hand man to the PR at Zufa, and he's quarters a year.  No.  Pay attention to the reporters. 
[02:16:30]  No, it's true.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's really good.  And he'll actually ask questions that I probably wouldn't have the balls to.  I've seen him in a few interviews.  He asked questions that weren't really pleasant, so he doesn't just lob in softballs.  He almost got slapped by Diaz.  Yeah.  Both of them.  And Rampage.  Rampage.  Rampage.  Actually did slap him.  Oh, shit.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Fired up and walked away.  You had a great tweet about Rampage.  When we say it, it said that somebody is avoiding fights because they're, well, it actually  wasn't about Rampage.  I don't know who it was about, but you said that some fighter's avoiding fights because  his contract's running out, but his name rhymes with Menton Maxon or something like 
[02:17:00]  that?  Yeah.  Jen Quaxon.  I can't say his name for legal reasons.  But he's ducking fighters.  It's a smart-ass remark.  That's great.  And why does he want your kick?  He wants one of your kicks out loud.  Your quad kick?  Is that what it's called?  Yeah.  The oblique kick.  Joe Rogan named it.  I guess.  The spinning elbow.  I don't know.  He's a wuss.  He's a wuss.  He's like, he has the tough guy persona, but he complains about anything that has to go  in his field.  My contract.  Oh, yeah, he complains. 
[02:17:30]  He wants to take me down, and that's not real fighting.  Oh, shit.  He's such a baby.  Really?  He's a baby.  It's unbelievable.  John's got this nasty kick, and he throws it right to your oblique.  Now, if he's on the kneecap, it's illegal.  That isn't relevant.  He doesn't go to the kneecap.  He throws it right above, and it's so deadly, and it's hard.  You know, it's a really hard blow to land.  I can't even feel where that wearer would hurt like that.  So Rampage wants it banned.  That move's illegal.  Why?  Because it works? 
[02:18:00]  That's kind of the point here, Paige.  Have you ever missed that kick, though, and hit him in the kneecap?  No, not too often.  I practice it all the time.  All the time.  It's a beauty.  I think I felt that kick when you were in one time.  I've done everything to you.  Yeah, you put the shin in my, uh, was that kind of like that kick?  It's the worst thing I've ever felt in my life.  Jimmy has been fucking abused by just about every fight.  I always take, like, one little shot just to see what, you know, because I get choked out.  No, I'm not actually. 
[02:18:30]  Well, you know, a little bit of a mess is a little too much.  But that's not why I do it.  I'm not, it's not a sexual person.  We have so many clips of him in some type of a head.  Not even a little bit.  Where it just, like, goes, oh.  I can't get you, darling.  It taps in my second.  It's like this.  But that leg kick, that blow to the leg, it was, like, literally, I was like, I'm going  to vomit.  I thought I was going to vomit.  It was such a weird, your system is not used to taking that, dude.  I love, John was like, does it get you going a little, Jimmy?  Yeah, yeah.  You get a little, you fill up a little bit when we chill, you know, when us big men come 
[02:19:00]  in here and put our arms around your neck.  There's something beyond just curiosity with Jimmy.  But, no, I'm telling you, it really is, as a fan, you never, the first time I did it,  BJ Penn was in, and we were just talking about arm bars.  I'm like, I want to see what one is like, because you watch them, and I've never felt  that.  I want to see on a mild level, you know, a level one.  What is that?  So, he just fucking flipped his legs up, and I was like, oh my god, that fucking hurts.  A lot.  It hurts so good.  It makes me respect the fighters even more, though.  It's like, the fact that I have felt like that choke, and the fact that you guys fight 
[02:19:30]  through that shit, and don't just go, all right, I'm out, is amazing to me.  It absolutely is.  You'd want to tap out immediately out of just self-preservation.  And they're doing it, joking around, but to actually have a guy doing it because he really  wants to knock you unconscious is mind-boggling to me.  I mean, I've been doing a little, you know, a little working out lately, which is fairly obvious.  Yeah, I've seen that.  That's clear.  That's clear.  Fairly obvious.  Looking at the two men, and then there's Jimmy, it looks like Make-A-Wish.  Really?  Bob, why?  You look like a little boy. 
[02:20:00]  Thank you.  That's so true.  That's what makes it fun.  I know.  It's very hurtful.  I'm looking this way, and you don't quite fit in either there, Bobby.  This is the evolution of Jimmy.  It looks like the three of us are trying to balance your weight out.  I remember where we went when you fought in sofa.  I remember the most uncomfortable I've ever been in my life.  One of the times is where you just lost, and Jimmy wanted a photo with you so bad.  Right after the fight, we went up the stairs, and you just started eating because you probably 
[02:20:30]  haven't eaten in fucking two days.  He hadn't lost.  That was after the weigh-in.  That was the weigh-in.  No, it was after the fight.  We did it both times.  After the weigh-in.  We did it both times.  No, we wanted to give Chael a comment.  We were doing commentary.  Good memory.  It was after the fight.  I remember after the fight because he was sweating, and he was like, I remember you're  out of your breath, and we were up in the bleachers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  And you were like, just hang out.  It might happen.  I'm like, dude, he just lost.  But he was like, and I had the camera. 
[02:21:00]  You know, because I'll, you know, what am I going to do?  No, I'm telling you, I have a photo with Chael, but I wanted to get was, we wanted,  the first day we wanted to get some commentary, and I've never been back behind the, after  the weigh-in, and you were just shoveling fruit, and you weren't talking to anybody, because  they said, whatever it is you have to do, but you were barehanded eating fruit, and you  said hello on your way down, but I didn't even ask you a question, because I'm like,  no, he's obviously in that place.  You know, I don't know what that's like.  The fruit place.  Yeah, the fruit place.  I guess I should have understood.  The barehanded fruit place. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  Don't ever mess a man when he's in his fruit place.  Keep his fruit.  And how much weight will you guys put back on?  Like, that's amazing to me, that you're just kind of like, you're just kind of like rehydrating  your bodies, and what will you, how much will you put back on that next day?  I'll do about 17.  You'll do about 20, yeah.  Whoa.  What, 20 pounds you could do?  Yeah, 20 pounds.  Wow.  In one day?  20, 25, yeah.  That's great.  But it comes out in one day, too.  We've got to take it out the day before.  So yeah, you have to put it back in, or you're going to fight dehydrating it.  Holy shit, that's amazing. 
[02:22:00]  That's amazing.  You're a heavyweight when you're fighting.  For sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you guys are both heavyweights when you're fighting.  Oh yeah, for sure.  Wow.  But doesn't that mess you up?  You hear that, Cain Blasquez?  You hear that?  Do you hear me?  Do you hear what Jon Jones is saying right now?  Oh no.  Jon Jones wants you, Cain.  Jon Jones isn't having it.  I wish I was better at it.  You had me, man.  I was hooked.  I was into it.  Will you give me crap talking lessons?  I thought it was pretty good.  That was good.  You've got to watch The Rock a little more.  That's all.  I know, I've got to watch it.  A little bit.  I was inspired. 
[02:22:30]  I don't got it down yet.  Do you want to fight Cain?  No.  No, I don't.  I would fight him if I was a little bigger, but I have no intentions of fighting him anytime soon.  Were you guys surprised at the Dos Santos fight and how he dominated him?  I couldn't believe it.  I was surprised, dude.  I was more surprised when Dos Santos knocked him out that time.  I really thought Cain was the best fighter.  Dos Santos is so good, though.  He really is.  I underestimated him.  I'm not going to do that anymore.  Dos Santos just had that it factor.  It seemed like everybody he touches just goes down. 
[02:23:00]  He does great against wrestlers with his takedown defense.  He kicks strikers' butts.  I just thought he had it against every style.  Obviously, I was really not.  He said that he had a lot of problems, though, because he broke his girl and he was all messed up mentally.  He broke up with his girl?  Yeah, that's what he said.  He said one of the reasons why he lost the fight, he said that his girl and him had some issues going into the fight.  Psychologically, he was all fucked up going into the fight.  That's what he's saying now.  I mean, sure.  I would suggest that in addition to that, getting pummeled about the chest, neck, head, and face had something large to do with it. 
[02:23:30]  I love Jill.  But yes, it could have been the breakup, sure.  You think it was the combination of the breakup and the fist?  But you couldn't wait until after the fight to start that shit?  Yeah, I believe him, too.  That's what women do.  They wait to the worst time.  I heard what happened with Del before a fight.  His girlfriend threw an ashtray at him or something years ago. 
[02:24:00]  Fucking bitches.  They're the worst women.  It's like, you couldn't wait?  The hell are they thinking?  One more day?  I loved after the Anderson fight, too, man.  This is why I love Chell so much.  It was like, they would say, well, he grabbed your shorts.  And instead of taking that and going, yeah, he victimed.  You're like, I grabbed shorts, he grabbed shorts.  It's like, who cares?  We all grab shorts.  We all grab shorts.  It's like the chains in football.  When it's all said and done, it evens out.  Sometimes it doesn't go your way, but that's just the way.  Yeah, but that spinning back fist was like, as soon as you... 
[02:24:30]  Did the back fail?  When you fell on your butt and you were wedged into the cage, I was like, fuck.  You had that look like, fuck me.  I actually thought it was well executed.  Anderson just ducked so fast.  He did get out of the way.  And it made you look extremely slow.  And I'll coordinate it.  He's getting the hang of it.  He's getting the hang of it.  He's got a lot better.  Yeah, he is.  He's getting it down now.  Well done, John.  Well done.  I'm warming up.  Remember I was late.  I just woke up. 
[02:25:00]  And he lured me in with the initial compliment.  I was like, oh, man.  And then he beats me over the head.  That was very Chell of you.  Yeah, that was.  Well done.  Thank you?  I don't know.  Should I say thank you?  Back-fisted compliment.  And when is your fight happening?  April 27th.  April 27th.  It's in Jersey, too.  Financial center.  And you guys are on this season at 185, correct?  Yes.  Well, yeah.  Yes, that's correct.  The guys on this season are at 185.  But maybe I misunderstood your question.  They're going to fight on the 13th of April, not on the same card as John and I. 
[02:25:30]  Is that what you were asking?  Well, I was going to get to that.  But, yeah, I mean, you guys aren't doing light heavyweights.  You're doing 185.  Yeah, we did middleweights, yeah.  Correct, 185.  Right.  Did you guys watch the show last night?  No.  I got into a big fight with my wife because she was supposed to record it, but she got  she recorded it.  Oh, you went on the way, too.  Justified.  No, seriously, I was really freaking angry.  And he was too busy trying press milk, too.  I did not, no.  I forgot it was on.  We get up at 4.30.  How is Justified?  Is that pretty good?  It's a great.  I DVR'd it.  I love the show, yeah.  It's a great show.  Compare the Sons of Anarchy. 
[02:26:00]  Which is better?  Sons of Anarchy.  Okay.  Yeah, but I can't watch.  Sons of Anarchy just went a little too far last year when they lit the little girl on  fire.  Oh, I was upset.  Yeah, didn't I?  I was like, I get it.  She's screaming, Daddy.  I talked to Kim Coates, the actor who had to watch.  It was his daughter.  Yeah.  I dressed him down.  I was so upset.  And he said, yeah, a lot of people keep coming up to me telling me that.  It was like too much.  Yeah, I was a crazy fan, but it's like, man, somebody needs to tell you.  That was really inappropriate.  Yeah, that was fucked up.  I mean, he turned out to be the nicest guy ever that just showed up for work one day and got 
[02:26:30]  stuck with that role, but.  Yeah, imagine reading that.  Imagine meeting the girl going, ah, shit.  Now I got to get another job.  Right.  That sucks as an actor.  I'm lit on fire?  There's no coming back from fucking fire.  You're right.  They're telling us in the headphones that you have to rap because you have other press.  That sucks.  Tickets are on sale for the big fight April 27th at the Prudential Center, by the way.  And every Tuesday night.  Now, it's on Tuesday instead of Friday. 
[02:27:00]  Thank God.  Does it replay on Saturdays, too?  Is that, or am I remembering something wrong?  They said it replays on Saturday on Fox, or no?  I don't know about that.  I only know, yeah.  Tuesday night, it's on FX, which is great.  And it's a, they show so much.  I love that they show, like, they showed Dana talking to you guys before, like, giving you  almost a pep talk, which sometimes they don't show on the, you know, that's kind of behind  the scenes with you guys, which was kind of interesting to see that you guys, you know, look  at guys, you can do this, you can blow it off, or you can really try, it's up to you, but 
[02:27:30]  it's going to show.  I kind of like that, the new show.  It's great.  And 185s, these guys, like I said, it's not like the heavyweights.  These guys are fast and they're powerful.  And, you know, I can't wait to watch this season.  This is going to be great.  Plus, with you guys.  Do you guys go at it all?  Does anybody break a door down?  We don't break any doors, but you're going to have to tune in to see if we get into it  or not.  But I can tell you, and it pains me to tell you this, but John Jones did a fantastic job. 
[02:28:00]  He's an excellent coach.  He gave of himself.  He was on time.  He was there every day.  And his guys loved him.  And we really had a good experience.  Under all this, Brown, I'm blushing, Joe.  Who's going to win the fight?  Between the two of us?  What do we do here?  John, would you like to work those bike skills you've been practicing?  Let's go rock, paper, scissors, shoot.  I'm hoping for a controversial split decision.  A controversial split decision. 
[02:28:30]  I'm definitely getting this one.  It's amazing.  It's completely the opposite dynamics as you would have thought.  You guys are getting along.  It's completely the opposite.  But wait until the fight happens.  These two are going to go out.  I'm telling you, for all the fans out there who are not happy that me and Chell have gotten along so well, me and Chell are adults.  You know what I mean?  Husbands, fathers.  We don't need to act like idiots to beat the shit out of each other.  That's our job.  You know what I mean?  Exactly.  Yeah, we'll leave that to you guys.  So trust me, come April, it's going to be a fight. 
[02:29:00]  No, I'd rather have it real than a fake.  I like the fact that whatever it is, it is.  Yeah, fake animosity.  I'm with you.  It's not real.  Although Jimmy would have fallen for the fake animosity.  Apparently I would have.  He's the most gullible guy.  He fell for 50 cents bullshit.  Yeah, I certainly did the whole Mayweather thing.  I'm like, are they going to kill each other, guys?  Oh, gee.  I really am an asshole.  They got to go.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Thanks so much for coming in.  1.59.  John, I think we're getting kicked out of here.  No, you can stay.  Are you taking the hit? 
[02:29:30]  Because I'm feeling a little sick.  No, you can stay.  Appreciate your guys' knowledge of our sport, though.  Truly.  It's really a pleasure to talk with guys.  It's a pleasure.  They say shit in our ears.  They're telling us, hold on, before you go home, let's make sure we're rolling.  Your peeps are dragging you out.  Yeah, no.  Can I ask your ethnicity with the hair?  Thank you.  Exactly.  You don't have a perm, do you?  That's your hair.  Thank you.  We have been toiling over this for years with this kid.  Apparently, one of his relatives.  It's red. 
[02:30:00]  One of his relatives, way back in the day, was Thomas Jefferson.  All right.  And we hear about how Jefferson might have gone out to the fucking shack out back and  got a little busy with some of the help.  And we're thinking maybe he was one of the offspring, great, great, great, great grandson.  Well, you're pulling it off.  That's awesome.  Yeah, I couldn't do it, but yeah, it looks good on you.  And aside from his new wife, they were married earlier last year, he only dated exclusively  black chicks until his wife, who was a white chick. 
[02:30:30]  Once you go black, you don't go black.  Yeah.  No?  You know, somebody's going to make some money.  She's going to let you in, but they won't let you in.  Oh, yeah?  Are you here, Joe?  Yes, I'm mad!  Okay, Joe.  Oh, shit.  I guess that only applies to a black bitch.  It's your people, not us.  Be good, guys.  We've had it with you, guys.  We and John are out of here.  John Jones, and of course, April 27th, Prudential Center, UFC 159 on pay-per-view. 
[02:31:00]  Peace out.  This is the Open Anticipation of Sirius XM.  Here at the Church of Norton, we believe in preaching the true word of the Lord.  A man shall not lay with another man, unless they discuss it first.  Can I get an amen?  Join us and be inspired by the wonderful sermons led by Pastor Jimmy.  I am like Davey versus Goliath.  He's tall, so he can put it right in my mouth, much like those youngsters did. 
[02:31:30]  Can I get an amen?  Follow in the footsteps of God.  Honor thy mother and father, and occasionally take the penis of another man in your mouth.  And become a true disciple of Christ.  Eat my cock, drink my cum.  We've all read the book.  Can I get an amen?  Everyone is welcome in the arms of the Lord and at the Church of Norton.  Can I get an amen?  How about A-boy?  I prefer A-boy or a few.  The Church of Norton.  If there's no hair on him, I'm going to fuck it. 
[02:32:00]  Can I get an amen?  Man!  Three-sex action.  Three-sex action.  The OP-REF show.  Those guys were a lot of fun.  Bobby did a great job with that, man.  Yes, tremendous.  Bobby knows his fucking UFC.  Yes, he does. 
[02:32:30]  Good job, Bobby.  Yeah, they were great.  Really nice dudes, man.  They're really nice dudes, but it kind of bums me out when they're friends, because I love  when Chael does his thing and goes at it with somebody verbally.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm glad they're not faking it, though.  No.  Yeah.  And the fight's going to be amazing.  April 27th.  We're all going, right?  Yeah.  That's the one we should all go to.  I might have to work.  It's close.  I might be booked already.  Really?  Yeah, I'm Christ.  Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[02:33:00]  What happened?  It's going to be a fucking crazy fight.  I know.  San Diego.  That's going to be the fight to go.  San Diego this weekend.  Yeah, I'll be in San Diego this weekend.  Believe me, there's no buzz whatsoever about my dog shit fucking trip.  Wow.  Why?  But people told you to go there.  Is it one of those again?  I'm just so done listening.  I'm going out and doing gigs because I want to film something or I want to shoot another  hour.  So I'm, you know, I got to go out and do gigs, but I'm tired of listening to fans.  They mean well, but come here.  All right.  Where are you?  Yeah.  How many people told you to come? 
[02:33:30]  Two.  Six.  What do you think those six represents?  Yeah, I figured they used to have a hundred friends.  I'm surprised they haven't done a social networking thing for comics or whatever musicians where  you can find out where you, like look at a map and say, I have 15,000 fans in San Diego.  I should, I can go there or I have, you know, eight fans in Cleveland mailing lists.  You can do that.  Yeah.  But it's, I mean, they should be able to look nowadays.  You should be able to look at a fucking map and see little red dots of where you're popular. 
[02:34:00]  Where you're.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, Scott, I'll be, I'll be going.  Oh, you guys should start a federation.  What?  Like a federation.  Like Starfleet?  You guys should all like join forces and work together.  Oh man.  That's going to happen.  Like crime fighters.  That's why I bring it up.  The Comedian League.  That'll never happen.  Meanwhile in San Diego.  Like a federation.  Yeah.  It's like you're here, you're over there.  Now, now you don't give a fuck that you're over there because you're so far away.  So then you as the comic of the federation will now help sell tickets for you over there. 
[02:34:30]  It's not going to happen.  That'll never happen.  You guys can help each other out.  No, there's very rarely do you see a comic retweet.  Where are you this weekend?  I'll do it once in a while.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Where are you this weekend?  I'm at Sidesplitters in Tampa.  Thursday, Friday, Sunday.  All right.  So he's San Diego.  You're Tampa.  So you guys can promote each other's gigs.  But what would that do?  You're promoting your gig.  Yeah.  But also you promote his gig.  Okay.  He does the same.  So now, like, you know, the Tampa people.  Should we pair up?  Yeah.  Why not?  I'm trying to make that arrangement with Kevin Hart and Louie.  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  We just trade off and promote each other's gigs.  Not Rich Voss and Bob Kelly?  That's a good one.  Yeah.  But I mean, I don't know.  It's time you guys should maybe work together a little bit.  Kayla, yeah, dude.  It doesn't matter.  You never see a comic retweet another comic's dates.  No, huh?  Well, because I get it because you're so paranoid that you're not going to fill up your fucking  shows.  Oh, yeah.  But you got to, you know.  But obviously the Tampa people aren't going to San Diego this weekend, so it doesn't hurt.  Right.  Why don't you two try this and see if it works?  Oh, Jimmy's going to be in San Diego at the Egg?  The Egg?  Where is it? 
[02:35:30]  No, it's the, I'll be at the American Comedy Company.  What's that?  It's a new club.  That's cool.  I love those new clubs that are popping up.  Yeah, I just did Albany in the Comedy Works.  He's got a brand new club, an actual club now, and it was fantastic.  Fucking great looking club.  Reminded me of the cellar.  Really?  Low ceiling, small stage.  They have a club upstairs and downstairs.  So if you do, I didn't do it, but you know, I sold out my shows, but if you're really  big and you sell out more than one show, because it's a 200 seater, you could do another 
[02:36:00]  show, you could just literally walk downstairs and go on stage and do another show.  It's crazy.  Louie Anderson did that.  He did a show upstairs.  And then he fell through the floor.  I'll never do Albany again.  Why?  I'll never do Albany again.  What happened to me?  I don't draw there.  Oh, shit.  They were good fans.  I don't draw.  I don't draw for shit.  So many ONA fans came this last weekend.  Okay, cool.  They were all the way when I was there.  Well, maybe because they didn't know you.  Looks like they're more podcast fans.  There was a lot of podcast fans there, too. 
[02:36:30]  But a lot of ONA fans.  It's a cross.  It's a synergy.  It really is.  It's a synergy.  Oh, what's that?  Oh, no, no.  I was asking about something else, but what were you saying?  What was it, Ben?  Scoop it?  No, I was singing with Bobby, because I see Bobby's got his fucking little baby.  Oh, his registry?  His baby shit up.  His baby registry.  Did you have to pick each of these out individually?  I didn't do one thing.  Or did you just go to one of the packages?  Is there like a baby package thing where you're like, yeah, we need column A?  They have these people that are at the Babies and Russes and shit. 
[02:37:00]  Really?  They just sit down with them, and they give you a whole fucking list.  This is what you're going to need.  And then they start checking off shit left and right.  So I'm here as a guy that's been through this.  I'm trying to help Bobby, and I'm X-ing some of his shit off his list.  Yeah?  I went.  Yeah, so you don't need a fucking, what's the baby formula one?  I told you to get rid of it.  First of all, Babies and Russes in Manhattan.  Yeah.  Okay.  That place is great.  There's a 16-year-old Dominican kid.  Which carriage do we get?  I don't know, man.  Oh, really?  It's like, oh, I'm fucked.  I'm fucked.  Go out to the suburbs.  Yeah.  You have to go to the suburbs. 
[02:37:30]  Get out of the inner city for this shit.  It was so annoying.  You need a little white girl going, may I help you?  Exactly.  Aw, that's so sweet.  Here, here's some things we got.  This one's good.  You know what?  Like, what happened?  Exactly.  Yeah, I'm going to have a baby.  What happened?  Is it the only carriage that you have right here?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  There's a stroller, and then there's a, we need a crib.  Do you have any more in the back?  Do you have any more of these in the back? 
[02:38:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Look, I'm going on my break.  You're going to have to get somebody else.  Before you go.  All right, can you show me somebody else?  Yeah, just wait here, and someone will help you.  Oh, God.  Yeah, five hours later.  Yeah, they're not very helpful.  Five hours later, it comes back up.  Sorry.  I said, I'm trying to get a crib that can hold two people.  What's the weight restriction?  You're looking for...  Hilarious.  If Uncle Paul is working at Baby's R Us, put him in the crib and leave him there for a half hour. 
[02:38:30]  You're looking for a crib that holds 209 pounds.  Yeah, I'm looking for a crib that won't break under duress.  You know what I mean?  A crib that can withstand a lot of rocking.  Jesus.  That's funny, man.  So who's going to buy it?  A tent over the top.  Yeah.  I want a crib with one-way mirrors fencing out so we can see who's coming.  Who's going to buy all this shit for you?  You got to buy some of this shit? 
[02:39:00]  I think it's me.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't understand this concept either, where you throw this out there to the world, your friends and family, and they go buy this shit.  That's why she was writing the...  Takes a village, Bobby.  When she was writing the description, she was like, hey, guys, thanks for checking out our registry.  I really appreciate it.  I was like, no.  If you're going to do this, make them buy some shit.  Yeah.  Like, have our friends and family buy real stuff. 
[02:39:30]  Aren't you having a baby shower?  She's having one in Boston.  All right.  So she'll get most of this shit.  She'll get all the cheap shit.  Yeah.  She's going to get the onesies.  I've never saddled anyone with wedding stuff or baby shit.  Why can't I just have a me registry?  Hey, everyone.  Here's some shit I'd like.  They do have that.  How about you just buy it for me?  They have that.  Your fucking tranny escorts have that.  It's a wish list.  That do you want to buy?  Everyone has a wish list.  Yeah.  A lot of porn, a lot of escorts have wish lists.  Yeah.  You go to Amazon, you can buy them a fucking... 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, for our wish list, it's a picture of her and her father hugging.  My wish list was destroyed in 1865.  Wait, that's how they get away with shit?  No, it's just one of the ways you can get gifts.  Oh, wow.  Oh, fucking Anthony.  That's terrible.  I like bringing a little historical humor into the program.  You're fucking awesome.  You're brilliant.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  What's your number one thing on here, Bobby? 
[02:40:30]  What's like your go-to...  If we got this, I'd be fucking happy.  The stroller, obviously.  Is it the stroller?  Yeah, the stroller.  500 beaners.  The stroller's good.  500 beaners.  That's not the one I wanted, but...  No, no.  That's not the magical remote control one.  That looks like a shitty stroller.  Let's take a look at that one for you.  He winced.  This is actually a good one.  I gave him a quick thumbs up and he winced.  Why is that good?  I don't know.  It's one click.  It goes down. 
[02:41:00]  It goes up.  It's light.  It goes all around.  That thing comes down again, so for the sun, it's got a little thing over here you can  see through.  You can pick this up, one click, and it comes up, and you can turn it.  God, you love your gadgets, too.  Yeah.  Mama's and Papa's Herbo stroller is the one you picked.  Yeah, the one I wanted.  Because like you said...  Do you want the Mama Cass one?  You said this a couple weeks ago.  Picking out a stroller is like picking out a car.  It's a nightmare.  Yeah.  It's a fucking nightmare.  Give me a stroller.  I had to take over because she had like 15 of them up for like three days in a row. 
[02:41:30]  And I just go, what does this do?  What does that do?  Show me this.  All right, that one's better than that.  All right, this is the fucking stroller we're getting.  Fuck you.  Put it up on the registry.  Yeah.  Perfect.  She was going nuts.  But the one I wanted was that push button one.  That's fucking...  That looks pretty badass.  They do the same thing with these fucking strollers they do with cars and phones, is they could  make a perfect stroller with that, you know, that you can use for, you know, a couple years. 
[02:42:00]  It could be lightweight.  It could have...  And they don't.  They got to take away one option.  So you're like, oh, it has everything, but it doesn't...  It's only...  You think they're all in cahoots?  It's like, fuck, just make the fucking stroller one that, you know...  Does everything.  Has everything.  Why do I...  It's like cars.  Why do I...  The DL, the XE, the ES.  Fuck you.  Give me a Civic with everything.  Who fucking knew that?  Yeah.  Does that thing break down real quick?  Like when you see a parent with the fucking stroller and they go... 
[02:42:30]  And it's just like, all of a sudden, like the Jetsons car.  It's in his little suitcase.  Yeah.  It's not the...  Yeah.  It's not the one button push.  No.  It made it easier to be a parent.  When we were growing up, fuck that.  Oh my God.  The rickety fucking strollers that...  Everything was a hazard.  With big, huge wheels.  That.  They brought a fucking playpen to my grandma's house that I could have been choked in.  Right.  Like everything was a fucking hazard.  Yeah, no one was...  I'll tell you.  No one was watching over this shit.  No.  Some guy invented something.  They just threw it out on the market.  Yeah.  Let's see how it works.  We'll test it in the field. 
[02:43:00]  One of the things we bought was we had to send it back because it gets mold.  It gets mold?  Yeah.  It gets mold.  Right here.  Look at this one.  You got the video?  This is it right here.  Strollers are all the same, it says.  And haven't changed in decades.  In decades.  Except for now, right?  Look at this fucking thing.  Watch this fucking thing.  This bitch is...  Until now.  Oh, shit.  She's turning a knob.  It's lighting up like the future.  Holy shit!  Dude, that is cool!  Oh, wow.  All right.  That is good.  All right, dude.  Until she hits it the other way with the baby of spillover and fucking crushes the kid. 
[02:43:30]  Look at the lights on it and shit.  Why is Bobby dancing?  Bobby's dancing.  He's got a stroller video.  Father in fame.  Your life just got set.  Look at the lights.  Daytime running lights.  Pathway lights.  Charges itself while you walk, motherfucker.  It's got a generator on it.  Suspension.  Suspension.  Bobby, you want that?  Lots of storage.  Watch this.  And it knows when you...  LCD dashboard.  It knows when the baby's in there and won't fold.  Oh, really? 
[02:44:00]  Your iPhone.  Charge your iPhone.  Plugs in.  Holy shit.  I want this music, too, while I'm walking on the street with my baby.  You could say hi.  Comes with the kid, too.  Yeah, sure.  Amazing.  Different colored fucking...  Backgrounds.  There we go.  Watch this.  Little seats.  Let's go inside for a second.  Ow!  Yeah, I'm guaranteeing it gets folded up, all fucked up.  Of course.  It never works that way.  Dude, that's amazing.  No, it's not.  You want that, Bobby?  How much is it?  I would love that.  It's a thousand.  Good luck.  But here's the thing.  This is why you can't get... 
[02:44:30]  You can only...  It only...  What?  It's an origami.  You can only...  It only lasts for like a year and a half or two years.  Why?  And then you're done.  Because, you know, like these have certain weight limits.  And as the kid gets older...  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  No.  We were just smiling.  Tonight.  We were just smiling that time.  That time we were just smiling when you said weight.  We were just smiling.  We were just smiling.  We were just smiling.  It's a badass fucking...  Two years is a long time with one stroller, though.  Because we'll have new shit.  If I rolled out with that thing, and I pushed a button, getting it. 
[02:45:00]  You pushed the button, people just like...  Push the right dog shit.  But you need that music with the carriage.  Yeah, you need that fucking...  Yeah.  That was some hot music.  Pretty fucking good, man.  Look at that hot shit, though.  What's up, son?  You rarely fold your stroller, so...  Oh, really?  It's cool as shit, but you rarely fold it.  Look at that dashboard.  I would, though, because I live in that...  It has a dashboard.  Of course.  Yeah, look at...  Fucking...  That's pretty fucking cool.  Tells you how everything's working.  Look at that, dude.  Are you operational?  Right.  The car seat goes right in there.  Oh, right in there. 
[02:45:30]  Sure it does.  Ba-boom.  Ba-ding.  What color?  What color are you gonna pick that out?  Can we hear the music again?  Oh, fucking great.  What color are you picking out?  Yeah.  Look at Bobby.  Fuck.  I didn't know how to dance like that.  That's a little strange.  I do, I have fucking hockey.  That's a little strange, man.  I have a gay man in me.  It folds up like the Lunar Rover.  That's pretty cool.  You're seeing me at weddings.  I, um...  Yeah, it's...  Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.  I'm digging it 
[02:46:00]  I like this music  Is that cup holder on there?  Yeah, the cup holder's on there too  They don't sell this in New York though  No, you gotta order it  No, you can get this at Babies R Us  No, you can't  No, you can't  No  I just  This is on Babies R Us page  Damn it!  I would love you to get that  And like  When you have the first day you get it  You roll it through like a fucking  A giant log  Like a  Two wheels through the log  The whole left 
[02:46:30]  Both left wheels through a fucking giant  Like a giant like  Fucking mastiff log  And then he folds it up  And it smears all over everything  Gets it on his hands  Oh god  Into the cremices  He has to take out toothpicks  To clean up his  Nice stroller  Smells like dog shit  The fucking first day you get it  Smells like new plastic and dog shit  It sucks  I would roll  And it's got like fucking leaves  Matted into it  Oh man  I love how descriptive Jimmy gets  I would love a nice dog log  Fucking cigarette butt  So  It's been brought to my attention that 
[02:47:00]  What is that?  That Ronnie B  Had a little fun with our gay off thing yesterday  We're having a gay off contest  And we got clips  A bunch of people on Twitter got a hold of me  And said you gotta listen to these clips from Ron's show  Gee  So we're doing a gay off, Bob  Can I have a banana?

[03:18:00]  Just  I don't know what happened  It just went south  But Sal volunteered  To do something  For the Opie and Anthony  Gay Off  And we wound up  Having a lot of  Bob Kelly's ass  Got smelled by  Sal  And by Troy  And by Erock  And I think the consensus  Was that it was  An abomination  And then Troy  Put his finger in his ass  And rubbed it under  Sal's nose  And under Erock's nose  And then Sal  Ate a Sherry's berry  Out of Troy's asshole  And then Troy 
[03:18:30]  Threw the berry  At Sal  So that's your  Opie and Anthony update  And I don't know  If anybody has  I usually start off  Reading an email  But I don't have  Any emails  Like in front of me now  So if you guys  Want to call in  You're more than  Welcome to call in  And I will try  To help you  You want to take a call  Of course  So I'm here for it Sam  Seth in Wisconsin  Hi Seth  Hey Jimmy  How we doing  Good buddy  How are you  Not bad  I need to know  Should I tell the wife  That I got caught  Trying to pick up  A prostitute 
[03:19:00]  Off of back pages  Well how'd you get caught  I didn't use  All my advice  And walked in  The hotel room  And laid the money  On the table  And the cops  Came through the door  Oh wow  I didn't  It's amazing  They waste  Police manpower  Going after  Just a guy  Trying to get laid  Now  It's a misdemeanor  Isn't it  Yeah  It's a little town  So it's not  Ever going to show up  On my criminal record  Do you think 
[03:19:30]  Your wife  Will find out  If you don't  Tell her  No  I don't know  Man  What's the advantage  Of telling her  Besides the fact  That you don't  Feel as guilty  How do you think  She'll react  I think  She'll try  To divorce me  Well then  Why would you  Tell her  Because  I'm stuck  In a place  Where  I go to  A 12 step  Program  Okay  And then  The 12 step  Program  They teach me  Honesty  Is the best  Answer  Rigorous honesty 
[03:20:00]  Yeah  I mean  They also say  That before  Doing certain  Things  You have to  Weigh the options  There's points  Where in certain  Programs  They talk about  Making amends  To people we've  Harmed  And they say  We have to  Weigh the options  Except when to do so  Would injure them  Or others  I don't want to  Get too specific  About it  But you might  Just want to  Weigh the option  And see  Is it important  To be honest  And clear your  Conscience  Which is something  That's certainly  Going to hurt her  And possibly 
[03:20:30]  End the marriage  Or do you  Kind of  Just talk it over  With someone  Who you  Spiritually respect  And then maybe  I would talk it over  With somebody you  Respect  Who maybe  Goes to your  Program  And has more  Time  Or who that  You talk to  Frequently  But it's a  It's a tough  Call  I mean  That's a case  I particularly  Would not be  Honest in  Alright  Yeah  That's what  I was thinking  But I figure  I'd get your  Advice  That you have  History in that  Yeah especially  Look if you  Fucked up  And if you 
[03:21:00]  Really think  It's going to  End the marriage  Then well then  If you want  The marriage  To be over  Tell it  But if you  Don't  Then you might  Just have to  Eat this one  Yourself  And you know  Talk it over  With somebody  And confess it  To somebody  Who you respect  Alright  Jimmy  I do  Appreciate it  Good luck  Buddy  Yep  Thanks  Alright  Sam  Who else  Can I help  Doug in  Wisconsin  Hello  Doug  Good evening  That's what I  Would be  If I was  In Wisconsin  I'd be  Doug in  Wisconsin  Because people  Would dig me  Boo  Hello  Douglas

[03:39:00]  Somebody  Close  In  Our  Family  My  Brother  In  Law  Was  Arrested  For  Child  Pornography  And  I'm  At  A  Fork  In  The  Road  Says  Jimmy  I  Gotta  I  Gotta  Decide  If  I  Want  To  Stick  Up  For  My  Values  I've  Always  Thought  That  If  I  Knew  A  Guy  Who  Did  Child  Pornography  You  Know  I  Cut  Him  Out  Of  My  Life  But  It's  So  Close  Our  Family  Is  Really  Close  And  We're  Really  Close  To  That  Side  Of  The  Family  Right  Now 
[03:39:30]  Was  He  Viewing  It  Or  Making  It  No  Yeah  He  Wasn't  In  Production  He  Went  In  A  Dark  Place  You  Know  So  To  Speak  For  A few  Months  He  Pulled  Out  On  His  Own  But  Then  It  Was  Too  Late  There  Was  A  Sweep  And  He  Was  The  Police  Sweat  Them  Up  Into  It  How  Much  Stuff  Did  He  Find  On  To  His  Credit  Jimmy  I  Won't  Get  Into  Numbers  But  It  Does  Look  Like  It  Was  Just  A  Mistake  As  He  Says  Or  Has  Other 
[03:40:00]  People  In  Our  Family  Say  So  Let  Let  Me  Ask  You  Jimmy  Do  You  Know  Anybody  Who  Has  Ever  Been  Arrested  For  Child  Pornography  And  How  Did  That  Change  Your  Relationship  With  That  Person  No  Matter  How  Close  They  Were  I  Really  Don't  I  Mean  I  I'm  Sure  I  Know  People  Who  Like  Child  Porn  That's  The  Weird  Thing  About  Child  Porn  Like  Even  Comics  Where  We  Talk  About  Everything  No  One  Talks  About  That  I  Don't  Know  One  Person  I  Know  That  Likes  That  Stuff  And  I  Certainly  Don't  Know  Anybody  Do  I  Know  Anyone  Arrested  If  I  Can't  Remember  Them  Oh  Yeah  I  Knew  One  Guy  Who  arrested for for fucking young boys but i didn't know him that well and uh it would depend on who 
[03:40:30]  the person was how would it change my relationship i mean um you know you can love somebody and not  like what they do or even hate what they do um it would depend on how they handle it too like if he  decides to get help and he really gets help for it and it's something he really addresses well  then maybe you can resume your relationship with him but if it's something he's like ah you know  i didn't i just looked at it when that's a child porn is different man than regular fucking porn 
[03:41:00]  that's a demon and and if he's not willing to acknowledge to himself how horrible that shit is  and how damaging it is then you might want to separate from him with love you don't have to  detach angrily but you know if he's not really willing to to get help for it after the arrest  and after the legal stuff is done you might want to rethink that uh but if he's getting help that's  one thing if he's getting help that's one thing he's definitely getting help but you know what  the problem is jimmy in order to get help he's got to sign up get this get this he's got to sign up 
[03:41:30]  for these support groups there's a fucking waiting list wow to get on that list that's how many you  know people are in this world that do that shit but we have kids there's kids in the picture so  one of the questions is you know you don't want to be that parent that forgives him or whatever and  you you know get back into our lives with him right and then you're that parent that finds out later that  he actually did something and they're thinking what if what if so i think you should put your  kids first obviously uh what's more important making like taking the chance that you might 
[03:42:00]  make a snap decision on him that's not right or endangering your kids the flip side to all of this  jimmy is i've been reading up on people who are sex offenders to a certain degree and there's many  different degrees of sex offenders right yes um and there is a witch hunt there is to say that  people will jump to conclusions and we don't see if anything we don't see child pornography in degree  like oh i just viewed or the production of it sure they do there's different legal ramifications for 
[03:42:30]  those things you go to jail well because i'll tell you why society may not look at like uh oh the  the legality of this differently and because society has had enough of children being victimized  sexually so if you if you're caught up in that net unfairly because you only looked at it you didn't  make it well that's the risk you take when you go and download it do you know and i'm not being holier  than now but it's something that you know is extremely damaging when you download it because no kid 
[03:43:00]  can make the decision to volunteer to be fucked in child pornography it's like when you watch porn  hey you know what she could be a drug addict or she could just be a girl with great tits who decided  to make a living fucking but when there's kids involved you know that before you go in so you take  that risk there's even degrees in the graphic you know how graphic the pictures are we're talking  pornography can be technically kids in a bathing suit i know i understand that i understand that yes 
[03:43:30]  there's there's you can involve uh a subject who's physically assaulting and those are different  degrees so even then you wonder should you just lump this person into that just because they had a  thing for 12 year olds in bathing suits well the fact that you have to go through all this explanation  in your head and this justification and this excuse making for this person because deep down you  probably don't want to acknowledge like wow man i shouldn't really be that close to this person 
[03:44:00]  anymore this is bad so you're making excuses like well there's degrees and you're right so he's not  going to go to jail for child rape but if he got caught up in this uh he's probably looked at other  stuff too i doubt that he stopped at 12 year olds in bathing suits yeah i doubt it maybe he should go  to therapy again if there's a waiting list for those other things there's no waiting list to get a  therapist and really begin working on yourself that that's a tough one man i'm telling you that's a demon i am  so fucking happy i don't have jimmy thanks for just giving me this hour-long forum i love what you 
[03:44:30]  do thanks buddy thank you all right have a good one i'm sorry that's happening to you good luck okay bye  rich in maryland ah hi that must be a man with family in maryland he's rich in maryland because  you're rich if you have family bite me hi jim i got a question for you uh i go to the usual porn sites  you know lobster tube and motherless and newborn and i keep getting viruses yeah and i have to call 
[03:45:00]  a computer guy to come in to get rid of this one virus that i had so he came in and he says oh you've  been looking at porn so you know i was kind of embarrassed with it but you know i i copped up to it  and he got rid of the virus and everything and he put an antivirus on my computer which prohibits me  from going to porn sites well that's not that's not cool every time i do i get bumped off the off  the internet and i gotta log off and then reboot and i didn't hook back on to to it again so i got 
[03:45:30]  rid of that virus antivirus but i was wondering what antivirus you use that that that would uh or a good  antivirus you use to get rid of uh uh any viruses from for much and uh i don't use antivirus 7 mac  and maybe it was your pop-up browser control stuff um i don't know enough about computers but uh  i can't think of anything that will bump you off x tube or x hamster so are you download if you're 
[03:46:00]  downloading porn maybe you'll get viruses but can you i don't think you're going to get a virus  going to you point or x tube i'm not saying you can't but if you're just watching it i don't just  don't download anything well i don't download i just i just you know i was at uh uh lobster tube  and i was watching uh it was you know a mother-daughter thing on lobster tube it's not a really that big  of a deal and all of a sudden i got this i got this uh uh look like a screensaver that came up and had  the fbi uh logo on it and it said that uh uh the fbi has blocked my computer for viewing porn 
[03:46:30]  and it cost me 200 hours to get rid of it yeah i did everything to get rid of it and i couldn't  i just heard of that virus by the way it's uh someone told me about that where it locks up your  computer oh it does and that's being used and they ask you to send money and that money i hear is being  used to fund some civil war or some war somewhere um i forget where i just someone talked about this  last night too i don't know i've never encountered that stuff get a fucking mac and uh you know just go 
[03:47:00]  just go to some of the bigger sites because i i have no i haven't had a computer virus in many  years dude so yeah i don't know just don't be embarrassed they have to fucking look through  your computer that's all yeah yeah all right all right man thanks i appreciate it happy spanking  yeah bye all right sean in brooklyn yes sean yeah yeah jim um like my wife she's like  started with this comedian dude like a long time ago every time i see the dude on tv i get like 
[03:47:30]  really pissed off like like i know it was like a long time ago when i see the dude i just get like  mad well none of us like to be honest none of us like to see uh a guy a guy that has fucked our  girlfriend or our wife or whatever in the past none of us like it's like bumping into the x none of us  like to see this person but it's a part of life i mean it happens i mean everybody has a past so why  would you let that get you so mad i mean you have a past too you just might not be seeing the chicks 
[03:48:00]  that that she doesn't see the girls you've hooked up with so why would you get mad at uh at that  well you might want to look at the positive and that she's with you um and he maybe he gave her a  lousy fuck did you ever ask her the details that's what i that's what i would do with girlfriends  would do when i would get threatened or feel uncomfortable or feel bad i would just ask for 
[03:48:30]  details i swear to you i would ask for details and i would just jerk off thinking about it i made  it dirty for myself because that threat or that insecurity of other men weighs on all men that  that kills us more than anything so i just learned how to make it dirty in my own mind and stop obsessing  because you know there's plenty of times i would be with a girl and we would fucking you know her ex  comes up or you know not on tv but one place or the other all right i mean i'm too insecure for 
[03:49:00]  that but thanks for the advice man i really appreciate it yeah don't let it eat at you man  you're married to her you got her you know everyone has a past and you know again it's not a big deal  if you don't want to get the details fine but don't let it eat at you um you know there's plenty of  other things to feel shitty about not her past you shouldn't all right man cool cool i love your  comedy man i'm big fan of you thank you buddy be good take care take care joel  hi joel hey jimmy how you doing i'm good how are you all right um i just wanted i was interested  if uh you had ever gotten uh hookers or escorts in uh mexico i never did no i went to acapulco no 
[03:49:30]  wait what's it begin with a c when i went to spring break cancun for mexico for mtv years ago it's  actually where i met 50 cent the first time we were on a flight together um but i did not get any  hookers when i was there so i've never ever prostituted in mexico okay yeah sometimes i go  to san diego and i jump over to tijuana there's the escort service i use but oh okay curious yeah  no dude i would i wouldn't go near mexico and i'm going to san diego this weekend but i would never go 
[03:50:00]  this just it's too crazy with the cartel violence and stuff i i would avoid mexico at all costs  all right thanks jimmy have a great one okay buddy e-train in boston oh hello e-train  hey jimmy how we doing brother how are you i'm doing okay um i guess i guess hopefully you can  give me some advice here um um i've been married seven years and that's not the problem my marriage  is pretty awesome um prior to her i was dating this girl for close to three years and we almost got 
[03:50:30]  married and it was pretty serious and then we had a really ugly breakup and just this past weekend i  recently found out that she she died oh and i you know there's a part of me that has sadness you  know about it but at the same time i i guess technically i just don't know how to feel like  she it ended very badly and to a point where i never spoke to her again or forgave her let me ask you  how how long are you together we were together for uh three years and how long ago did you break 
[03:51:00]  up uh seven years okay so what what actually broke you up would she sleep with somebody else to go with  one of your friends well uh the day we broke up she slept with her best guy friend and then i found  out that she cheated on me once before that well your relationships always end badly and people do  dumb stuff so what are you conflicted about feeling like really sad is there a party that's glad or a  party that's indifferent um no it's i i am i guess there's part parts i miss part guilt that 
[03:51:30]  um which i knew she was ill she's been an help she was an ill person and we knew that she only had  a half-life expectancy okay and i guess uh i guess i feel a little guilty that i never allowed her to  feel forgiveness from me did you did she reach out to you and try to make up um a couple times  and the last time she did i tried uh you know she did the whole like friend me on facebook thing and 
[03:52:00]  the last time i she did it i accepted her friendship and but after a day of just seeing her drama posts  and everything i just i unfriended her i just couldn't deal with it sure it was too much of the  same bullshit yeah you realize that the breakup was the right thing and it saved you seven years of  misery um just because somebody is sick it doesn't mean that you have to be involved with them if  they're people that you find you just genuinely don't like anymore or that genuinely you don't  like you know you don't enjoy being around um you can still feel sad that she's dead but i wouldn't 
[03:52:30]  feel guilty you you know you didn't do anything wrong the relationship ended you're supposed to  sometimes you're friends with your ex but you're supposed to fucking move on when the relationship  ends you know and then your facebook friend her and she's still babbling about the same stuff  you should feel confident that you know what you made the right decision by not getting sucked back  into it yeah that that actually helps a little bit you know you think of it that way yeah and you  could feel sad somebody's dead sometimes we think we're supposed to feel worse than we do  um just whatever it is it is however you feel you feel you know i heard years ago feelings aren't facts 
[03:53:00]  then they come and they go man uh if you feel sad griever if you find yourself feeling indifferent  okay it's been seven years maybe indifference is what sets in um and i guess the follow-up question  that um i'm a stand-up and you know the stage is where i do a lot of my therapy but yeah is it  wrong to bring us up on stage when it deals with someone who's passed away no if it was i'd have five  minutes of material you got it you got to talk about everything in your life uh you might want 
[03:53:30]  you don't want to name her you don't want it to be specific to her but why not it's it's a part  of your life it affected you and no it's not wrong at all okay man thanks a lot man that helps  that helps a lot brother all right good luck man hey take care buddy  sorry mike in new brunswick oh mike new brunswick that's that's where i'm from north brunswick how  are you good jimmy how you doing good thank you listen uh i'm 27 years old i built my fiance for  11 years we got together at a really young age and her family came across really hard times so 
[03:54:00]  basically she's been with my family since almost been together after a year um i cheated on her a  couple times in the past and then you know she always moved right past it and then about a year ago  she was working at a place and she had cheated on me and it's kind of one of things where it's like  i haven't been able to move past it myself and i feel like it's just our relationship really can't  progress from it but now she's just been talking about getting married next year and all this 
[03:54:30]  other shit like that it's like i just don't know if i'm doing the right thing by staying with her  because part of me feels like she's only with me because she's unsure of her own true feelings  maybe i mean i don't how many times did you cheat on her well i cheated on her probably like three or  four times but i got caught out there two times now so she knows you've cheated twice how did you  find out she did well what happened was a family member of mine who's close to being 60 years old 
[03:55:00]  owned his own repair uh business his wife cheated on him and left him he needed somebody like a  secretary kind of thing to answer his phones and such and she was uh she was working for him and then  um he had a guy who's working for him probably like 30 years old you know one weekend she told me  that you know she just needed some time for herself and this and that she went out and then that's what  happened did she have sex with the guy yeah was it only that one time that i know of the thing 
[03:55:30]  is it's like you know i gave her my word on new year's eve that it was like look you know we're  going to start a new year try to start fresh and not talk about and kind of leave it alone you know  what i mean yeah i mean it's if she forgave you or maybe she didn't forgive you maybe she thought  she did and maybe she knew about the other times a lot of times women know even when they can't prove  it do you really think that's all she's done though and do you think that she'd be faithful from here  on out well i mean i know that she for the most part i mean i'm pretty sure that she  always was only because we were we were always like so tight it's like we always have been 
[03:56:00]  together like young like i don't drink she doesn't drink so we never really been out to bars we never  like we kind of just it's like wherever she was at i was at wherever i was at she was at so it's  like she never really had the opportunity to ever do anything else you know if you asked her hey can  i use your phone for a second would she just hand you her cell phone and let you use it  she didn't she didn't use to but but see that that's kind of what raised an eyebrow at me like  everything as far as phone bills everything's all in my name so it was like when this all happened 
[03:56:30]  i kind of felt like all right i'm gonna go online and i checked all the phone records and that's how  i really called her out there and it's like now you know for a while when that was going on it was  like hey you know can i grab your phone real quick i'm gonna check some you know on the internet or  whatever and everything will be deleted out of it now it's like nothing is deleted out of it  but at the same time she knows that i'm on top of it so she really can't right so you don't know if  she's still being dirty well i wouldn't know i don't know like if she goes to like a friend's house 
[03:57:00]  or a family member's house if she still talks to the guy like from a house phone or not like i'm not  so much worried about her talking to her or anything because i don't think that that really goes on  it's just that i don't know like if me myself not being able to move past it is gonna like just hurt  do nothing but cause more misery down the road uh yeah i would suggest moving past it before you  get married and maybe tell her what you just told me maybe it still needs to be talked about you know  you can't just say hey it's happy new year let's not talk about it if you're really weighing the 
[03:57:30]  option of not marrying her well then you should fucking tell her that yeah right i agree 100  all right well i hope i hope she's not fucking other people sir thanks brother all right good luck to  you and your cock my friend matt in jersey hello matt in jersey hello matt  hey jimmy how are you today oh i'm good matt thank you i just oh good i just wanted to call  and give the flip side to that guy who called back and said his wife or his girlfriend dated  a stand-up and he hates him yeah my wife also wants data to stand up um he's a he's a pretty big guy

[03:58:30]  years ago she uh she told me this story one time that i heard him tell where they were in a pizza  place and he saw himself on a on a sitcom on the tv in the pizza place oh okay and i just had a  chuckle about that oh wow okay oh i didn't she she's married now very good very very good yes yes her  husband's pretty cool and uh and a big fan of this guy well thank you very much that was obviously  that was obviously before you yeah yeah all right well yeah don't let it at you man i'm a fucking  very mediocre lay so give her my best though she's she's a really nice girl and i'm happy to hear that 
[03:59:00]  she's doing well i know exactly who you mean and i hope she's doing good she's doing great thanks  jimmy okay buddy take care all right bye craig in arizona hi craig hey jimmy how's it going good how  are you good hey uh my question for you is it's a little bit strange from what the other topics are but  i'm one of the dudes that kind of relentlessly fuck with bobo on on twitter okay and i just i i  just wonder if uh you know you i i do have a lot of fun with it but then there's some guilt because 
[03:59:30]  you know the dude obviously hasn't had the greatest life out there and i just want to know if you uh  you think i should just knock it off basically yeah you know with bobo it's a weird thing man like  we like you know we have him in all the time and i like bobo a lot i really do and of course you know  that he's you know he's not the sharpest pencil and there's times i get frustrated with him because i'm  looking at him like i'm looking at like one of the guys like come on dummy what are you doing  you know i'm not looking at him like oh you poor victim i'm like what the fuck dude you're not  thinking um but you know when you fucking with him on twitter like i did i goofed on the other day 
[04:00:00]  about you know banging his chick or whatever but then after like a little while i was like what am i  doing it's like even though i kind of like him and he's kind of a friend from the show you know you  realize it's kind of mean spirited you're not necessarily on a level playing field so i kind of you  know like i understand people have fun with bobo but if you if you're questioning it then just lay off  him like you know this girl is he's talking to this girl a little bit too much he's probably  driving her nuts and and he'll suffer the consequences of that you know he doesn't need 
[04:00:30]  anybody else fucking with him so i would suggest you know if it's bothering you do leave lay off  him because i'm sure it couldn't hurt him to have people lay off him sure okay cool man i will i  will take your advice thank you man i really appreciate it okay man take care uh james in detroit  hi james james sam fucked up jeremy in missouri hello jeremy in missouri hey how you doing good  how are you hey listening to your show i realized how many whiny bitches are out there without real 
[04:01:00]  problems but i however have a real problem okay i'm with this girl i'm 25 i've been many girls i've been  with many girls and and they've all been freaks for most part well i finally got a good girl she's a  good woman she's a good cook she lets me bang her the only problem is is that she's not very good  at giving blowjobs it's the happiest blowjobs i've ever had in my entire life and that's something i  love doing she does not like doing it has no ambition to get better at it how do i do this  it's not a deal breaker if she doesn't get better at it i can still be with her without the blowjobs 
[04:01:30]  well i mean you could talk to her and say like guide her through it make it dirty um i don't like the  fact that she has no ambition to get a little bit better at it if it's something she knows you like  um you know just tell her what you like i guess that's the way i always do it like if a girl is  giving me head or we're doing something i won't scold her and go up up up now now you know i'll just  kind of go like you don't have you know wait like you know take it out lick lick the back of it or try  to get her to not just try to shove the whole thing in her mouth maybe she could lick it and stroke it i 
[04:02:00]  don't know but i would tell her nicely because i stopped seeing a girl one time because uh i like  getting head and i hate girls that that won't give me head because it annoys me on principle so she's  like oh i'll do it and she was doing it as a favor i was like no no don't worry about it stop don't  worry about it and then i just stopped seeing her but you obviously like this girl a lot more than i  like that one so oh yeah well i'm starting to fall for this girl big time the problem is that she had  she has like almost no experience she's been with maybe one or two partners where i 
[04:02:30]  however been with close to 50 right well then maybe she'll get better dude maybe in time she'll  get better maybe she's a little intimidated by your experience so she sounds like a good girl i  mean if you really like this girl and she cooks and she lets you fuck her all right so the head's a  little toothy there's gonna be something off with every girl you know imagine she gave great head but  she fucks all your friends i mean you know you take this option all right thank you all right take care  of you and your girthy cock godspeed you want to do that i have almost we have two minutes
