FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure, the most annoying thing on two legs, what a bore fest, who cares about the funny, just bring me the porn, aren't we dumb, hee hee, Ovi, oh do you want to play, Anthony, I will beat children about the head, Jim Norton, I'm dancing, I'm dancing, I'm just, I'm a naked whore, it's indescribable, I'm trying, it's like a rape that's covered by insurance, some of the comments they make are uncalled by 
[00:00:30]  for, why are you crying, the virus finally hit him, well with Jimmy you never know, it could be AIDS, no, yes, yes, it's the Ovi and Anthony show, the virus that spreads from town to town across the USA, and, I hate you, but enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Ah, hi, we are live, of course we are, and why does my mic sound completely different again, wow, this is, every day, now I gotta crank mine way down to my headphones, and it sounds tinny.  Aren't there settings where it's like, here's the Opie and Anthony settings, here's the JV and Elvis settings, here's the Radio Chicks settings, here's the Nick DiPaolo settings, all the other shows here in New York, of course, for the rest of the country. 
[00:01:30]  What about the John and Jeff show, you forgot the John and Jeff show.  John and Jeff stink.  Where are those settings?  Those sound settings should be silence.  Oh, they are god awful.  John and Jeff, whoa.  A couple of mo's.  Boy, really going out on a limb saying that one. 
[00:02:00]  But the settings are awful, there's so much bass in my voice right now.  Bass?  Mine's all tin.  And the listeners, they're sick of us complaining, blah, blah, blah, I get it.  But we need the engineer around here to have the exact same settings every time we're in here.  Tim, what's going on today?  Young Tim.  You're killing me.  Young Tim.  Yeah, this is like, ugh.  By the way, it's January 15th, 2007.  We are here live.  Every other radio show took off today.  We're live because it's MLK Day, Martin Luther King Day today. 
[00:02:30]  There was less traffic on the road, I noticed.  Yeah.  Basically, we don't acknowledge Martin Luther King Day here on the Opie and Anthony program.  We never have on any, we've never gotten the day off.  Never have, never will.  I don't know.  I know Ron and Fez got it off.  Well, you know.  Because they have Earl, a black producer.  Mm-hmm.  So they took the whole day off.  Right.  We don't have any black people that work for this program, so we don't get the day off. 
[00:03:00]  We're backwards.  Yeah.  Like, the days we should be working, we're not.  What the hell was that, Tim?  Now you're just off the air.  What happened?  No, you should still be on the air.  Yeah.  All right, wait, wait.  Do that again.  Do it again, and I'll crank my headphones up.  All right, now I got to do this.  All right, we'll turn the head.  Oh, that's a little.  Yeah, I guess that's more like it used to be.  It's different.  Oh, man, if you turn that back on, you're going to blow me out, because the volume is  a lot different between the two settings.  All right.  I can deal with this.  I don't know now. 
[00:03:30]  Now I'm thinking the other way was better.  I don't know.  I don't like this to be honest.  This sounds more like it usually does.  It affects with everybody?  Put it back for a second.  All right.  Let's try that.  Whoa.  Hey.  No.  That means nothing to anyone else, but it just blew out our eardrums.  You want to go with this?  Here, I'll do a hearing test.  Okay.  This or this?  I'd rather go with this to tell you the truth, because then I turn my volume where it usually  is.  And you're all good?  Which means that that's closer to what it usually is. 
[00:04:00]  All right.  But now what happens if we play something?  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Does this sound different?  Yeah, we're in good shape.  Sounds a little.  Well, that's better than the basey settings.  That's all it is, Tim.  See?  Just write Opie and Anthony show up there.  Okay.  Because it looks like everyone else is using this version.  All right.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  But today, we changed the name of the show. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  From now on, we want to be known as the iShow.  We're the iShow.  It's a small, lowercase i.  Right.  And then a capital S-H-O-W, iShow.  Yeah.  We're still kind of struggling to get ratings in a bunch of these cities, so we have to  make some drastic changes.  And one of the changes is that we're changing the name of the show to the iShow.  The iShow.  I'm iAnthony.  I'm iOpie.  That's iNorton.  Yeah.  And this is the iVirus.  The iVirus.  Correct. 
[00:05:00]  Just because for some reason you put an i in front of something, it sells.  Yeah.  And if you're listening, you're iDouchebag.  Welcome to the first day of the iShow.  This is the iShow, yes.  Until we get the cease and desist.  Which will happen tomorrow because everyone's off today.  Everyone's off today.  So we'll have fun with the iShow today.  Because God forbid you put i in front of anything. 
[00:05:30]  You have a little fun.  They start suing you.  You could be an iPest, sure.  Yeah, iPests.  An iListener.  Yeah.  Give us an iCall.  That's right.  We're going to have an iContest.  Use your iPhone.  I don't care.  I'll say it.  I don't even mean the one from Apple.  Just your phone in general.  Just your phone in general is now called an iPhone.  All right.  Maybe an iFatty can give me an iHummer.  Yeah, that's true.  Get out of the iCar.  It's all about the i.  Yeah.  The stupid iPhone taking over the world.  Taking over the world, I say. 
[00:06:00]  It's not out until June.  And this thing.  June.  I thought it was out already.  I thought everyone had it.  No.  Don't stop it.  Jimmy.  No.  Let's think for a minute.  If it was out, I would be toying with it right now.  Right now.  I am first online.  I'm going to be one of those douchebags that stand online at midnight and get trampled  at a store to buy this thing because I am, like, fascinated with the technology of it. 
[00:06:30]  I love the interface.  I watched the whole keynote video where Steve Jobs presented it, showed the whole video of  all of its features.  By the way, this is his world because they had CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, Consumer Electronics  Show, and...  Same time.  Huh?  At the same time, he was doing his own little Apple Electronics Show.  From his living room.  In San Francisco.  He's like, I don't need to be with all the rest of you geeks. 
[00:07:00]  It's my world, and I will do it my way, and I will announce the iPhone from my stupid couch.  And he really did steal a lot of thunder from a lot of the other tech companies by doing this.  They didn't have anything this year.  They had nothing to look at except for some dumb robot.  The big friggin' draw was the walking robot from Honda.  You've seen this thing.  It's a white...  Which, okay.  There's a plug. 
[00:07:30]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  I shouldn't use those jokes today.  Hey, hey, hey.  It's a white robot.  It's got Honda written on it.  It's got, like, a little backpack.  It looks like an astronaut-type thing.  And he walks, and he kicks a little soccer ball, and he walks upstairs, and then he runs.  That was kind of cool to watch him run across the stage.  Well, then he ran in a circle.  That was way more impressive than running from one end of the stage to the other.  His name is Asimo.  He was Asimo.  Yeah, it was Asimo. 
[00:08:00]  I faggot.  Why would you spend all that money on a robot?  Just get yourself a retarded teenager.  He does the same thing.  Right.  Runs around with a dumb name, kicking a ball.  Plug it in.  Shut up.  I look forward to the first person that dies because this thing chokes you to death.  We were sitting there watching this thing, and there was a big crowd around him.  There's a picture of him, Jim.  There's a big crowd around him, and a guy demonstrating Asimo.  Asimo, and we were thinking, God, how great would it be if he lost control and Asimo just grabbed this guy by the neck and popped his head off right in front of a horrified crowd at the CES? 
[00:08:30]  It was downright creepy that the thing didn't fall over.  It was really weird.  Yeah, he would balance on one foot, and then his arms moved the most realistically, I think, and his hands.  It's very articulate.  What they did after he ran around in a circle, they showed a tape of it, and he's actually off the floor.  When he runs, yeah.  When he runs, both legs are off the floor like a human being would be. 
[00:09:00]  For like a fraction of a second?  When you run for a fraction of a second, you're actually off the ground.  Yeah.  And this is the first time with robot technology they were able to do that, where the robot is actually off the ground both feet for a split second.  But the bottom line is that was the big draw.  That was kind of what everybody gathered around to see.  What is this going to do?  How can it help?  Why?  Most robots don't have to look like human forms to be functional. 
[00:09:30]  A lot of robots that work in the audio industry, it's just like a spot welder arm that just whips around and spot welds.  That's a robot that's useful.  To make a robot look like a person is kind of cool.  Yeah.  But as far as being functional, what's it going to do?  Babysitter.  A babysitter?  You're going to leave your baby with a robot?  Actually, yeah.  Why not?  You put a chip in your kid's head if it's screwed up.  I mean, you know, whatever you do.  Put a chip in your kid's head.  All right.  Let me just defer to Dr. Norton on his ideology about chips in children's head and robot babysitter. 
[00:10:00]  He's not that far off, though.  They're talking about how you could get, like, kids running.  Yeah.  You could get sneakers and shoes for your kids that has a little chip in it so you could, you know, do a little GPS action.  They'll have to go back to the laboratory.  The first time someone comes home and the thing is holding, like, a severed child leg, I somehow did good.  Like, he'll think he did another task.  It's one of them, too.  Move.  Sofa.  It looks like a mini astronaut, by the way, for the people at home.  Yeah.  You haven't seen Asamo yet.  Tries to change diapers and just, like, rips the kid's lower torso off of it. 
[00:10:30]  He doesn't know.  It's a robot.  And he's happy the whole time.  Yeah, he's all happy.  Hello.  Coochie, coochie, coo.  There's just a bleeding dead baby in the crib.  What can I do next?  Also, Asamo is completely just run amok.  Hey, and if you're going to build these stupid robots, no, like, mask, like you're a linebacker for the NFL.  Yeah, he's not like a football man.  I want to see the eyes of the robot to see what he's thinking, that creep.  I know.  It's got to have some kind of a, what do you want, a face? 
[00:11:00]  That'd be a little creepy.  Well, I want something because you don't know what's going on behind that mask.  Evilness.  There could be evilness behind that mask.  You don't know.  Oh, he's got a red light that just goes back and forth like a Cylon.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Old school.  He's got like a Darth Vader mask on.  I'm watching him run.  He's running the way a person runs when you've had six cups of coffee and a nice Mexican lunch.  Yeah.  And you are desperate to get home.  You're running down the hallway and as you're undoing your belt, it's like one of those moments. 
[00:11:30]  You're running toward the bathroom.  You're right.  Oh, my God.  I'm holding those Lexan cheeks together real tight.  It's about to have been computer chips all over the floor.  So, anyway, getting back to this CES in Vegas.  Yeah.  Hundreds and hundreds of people looking at the demonstration of Asamo.  They were doing the demonstration like every 15 minutes.  Yep.  And people were coming from all the other booths to check out this.  And this was like the thing to check out at CES this year.  And then, of course, what's his name is in San Francisco going, 
[00:12:00]  Oh, go F yourselves.  And he introduces the iPhone from, like, the comfort of his home.  The iPhone.  He didn't go to Vegas.  He knew he had gold.  It was a big audience of geeks.  And they were applauding everything that he was saying.  All the features that they were showing on the iPhone were getting like there was a stripper up on a pole.  Yeah.  That's how these guys, these geeks, were reacting to this thing.  And I must say, I was very impressed. 
[00:12:30]  That I wasn't applauding at home.  This thing looks pretty cool.  And, yeah, if this is the first step of what's to come in the next couple of years, it's real Internet, which is very cool.  Like, I have Internet on my little phone here.  But it's WAP, they call it.  So any site I go to, it tells me isn't accessible.  Yeah.  It sucks.  This, you go to any website.  Everything an iPod does.  All the music, videos.  It's got a keyboard on there if you want to do it that way. 
[00:13:00]  No buttons.  The space for the phone is amazing.  Yeah.  And it's no buttons.  It's just a flat glass screen that you do all the inputs through.  I was fascinated by it.  If you're a tech head, go to YouTube and look up his iPhone presentation and go through the whole thing.  It's like 40 minutes long.  And what's up with the voicemail you were telling me?  One of the best things a phone does, and I have never seen it on another phone before, perhaps it's out there on another phone, but you can scroll through your voicemails. 
[00:13:30]  So you go to voicemail, and they'll be like Bob, Pete, Jim, the names with the times that they called.  So you can scroll through it.  You ever have to sit, you have 18 messages.  18 messages.  And you've got to sit through.  First message, 845, Monday, the 16th.  You're like, oh, my God, just get to us.  And it's crap. 
[00:14:00]  So you're 7, delete, 7, 6, 5.  And then you've got to keep going through and through and through.  This one, you scroll to the ones that you want to, so you can listen to it not in the order they came in, but in the order of importance to you.  If you want to hear, you know, mom called or something, you want to hear from mom, you could get that message first.  You don't want to hear from somebody, some jackass is calling you.  You delete it without even listening.  Yeah.  But I go through Verizon, and I use their service. 
[00:14:30]  How do you do it like it's not their service?  It's singular.  But for some reason, this phone does that.  I don't know why other phones, you've got to sit through all your crappy voicemail.  That feature alone was like, I'm sold.  Then they've got the mapping system through Google Maps.  Basically, it'll show you where the nearest Starbucks is, let's say.  You want to look up something, it shows you where the nearest one is.  Or the nearest Home Depot, or the nearest whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really got a lot of cool gadgets. 
[00:15:00]  A lot of people are complaining because it's very expensive right now.  But I think, of course, I think the price will come down.  Oh, that's where the market is going to be.  Of course, the price will come down.  But I was really, really fascinated by the whole thing.  I just wish I had a bigger hard drive.  It's going to be 8 gigs, which is like I wish I had a little bit more because I have a lot of songs and video.  How do you keep it on 8 gigs?  Yeah, but eventually.  Carry around your old little pocket hard drive like a dork.  Eventually, you'll be able to do that.  That's where this is all going. 
[00:15:30]  Everything is going to be on your stupid phone.  Everything.  That's what it's going to be.  Your iPod, your phone.  You can't have a phone and something else.  It doesn't work for a guy unless you're carrying around the man purse or something like that.  I'm one of these guys.  If it doesn't fit in my pockets, I'm not carrying it around with me.  And I can't have two things, two electronic things.  I don't want an iPod and my phone and this other thing.  So everything going to the phone is the future because that's something that everybody carries, a telephone. 
[00:16:00]  Everyone has a cell phone of one sort or another.  So it's going to get to the point where everything is going to be on your cell phone.  There you go.  I'm predicting.  I am like the great Criswell.  I'm predicting everything on a telephone.  Well, so we're taking a page from my phone.  This is now the iShow.  The iShow.  With iOpie, iAnthony, iNorton.  Mm-hmm.  Log on to iPalTalk.  And there's iRock right there.  iRock.  Wow.  He's named after an old Guinea Camaro.  Wonderful. 
[00:16:30]  Of course.  Get in the car, Angela.  Get in the car.  Of course.  He would be the only one where the i thing doesn't work.  Doesn't work.  It doesn't work for him.  Just call him iFat.  Did you lose some weight?  Do you think you did?  We weigh him Thursday.  I know.  But does he think he's on the road to recovery?  A lot of confusion on the message boards.  Because we first said we're going to weigh him Monday.  But now we want to wait a whole week.  No, we'll wait a whole week.  To weigh him again.  So it'll be Thursday.  Are you feeling like you're doing a good job?  So far, yeah.  So far?  Hold on, microphone.  So far?  So far, yeah. 
[00:17:00]  I was on a PalTalk over the weekend.  And iRock was on there also.  And just he couldn't stay on too long.  Nothing but pounding.  They were just pounding you about eating and everything.  They and me.  By they, I mean me too.  Yeah, you were the leader.  I'm sitting here like, the ringleader.  What do you think you're fooling, man?  All right.  Well, it's Martin Luther King Day as well here, right?  Yes.  You could put an I in front of that too. 
[00:17:30]  What's wrong?  I'm looking at an IC word.  Linda Stacey from The Post.  Yes.  And how she gave Ego Tripp's White Rapper Show three stars.  I'd like to roll up this newspaper and just smash her in the throat.  I haven't seen the White Rapper Show yet.  I have.  I'm prejudging it.  It's got us.  You're prejudging it.  Even if it doesn't stink.  You're racist.  She wrote what she wrote.  Racist, probably.  Interesting.  You bet.  Fat house wife.  With her dead hand picture.  I just hate her guts.  I haven't seen that one yet.  The show is not that bad. 
[00:18:00]  It's a bunch of Wiggers living in the house.  Yeah, that's what I hear.  In the middle of the Bronx.  Is it the Bronx, right?  Where do rap start?  Living in the hood.  Where do rap start?  In the Bronx, right?  All right.  So they're in the hood.  And it's not like the real world.  Rap started on a large wooden ship in the, I believe, 1500s.  Hey, hey.  It's Martin Luther King.  Well, that's where it started.  But instead of living in luxury, it's the Bronx.  So their surroundings aren't like the real world house and such. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, okay.  So they're not living in luxury.  And then they have to go around the neighborhood and do like, you know.  Community service?  No, contests and stuff.  Oh.  Like challenges?  Challenges and all that.  I'm going to have to watch.  I can't.  It's definitely worth a view.  I can't do two shows at once, two like reality shows at once.  I get too flustered.  So right now I'm DVRing geeks and.  Beauty and the Geek.  Beauty and the Geek.  Greatest show on TV.  Yeah.  That one is just two.  Hot, hot chicks and the geekiest bunch of douchebag guys that have no communication skills 
[00:19:00]  when it comes to women whatsoever.  How does he do it?  I'm Pi.  Pi.  I'm Pi.  Pi got kicked off though.  And he goes, he goes, my name is Pi.  And then he puts his thumbs together and puts his index fingers down to make the sign of  Pi.  Like an NFL goal post upside down almost.  Yeah, there you go.  I'm Pi.  And he goes, I'm Pi and makes like a little sign for Pi.  That is him. 
[00:19:30]  I'm Pi.  And poof, he got the boot.  That show is hysterical because all these CT bitches that are on this show are just toying  with these geeks.  And you know damn well they haven't had this kind of interaction with women before.  They're laying in bed.  Like one guy's laying in bed.  There's two chicks in thongs and bras like tickling him and like rubbing his hair.  Well, they know he's really uncomfortable so they're playing it to the...  Yeah, they play it and they say like, oh, I'd never do anything with him. 
[00:20:00]  Like alone.  Yeah.  They go, I'd never do anything with him.  It's just fun to tease him.  And this poor guy is thinking, ah, maybe these chicks like me.  Maybe it'll develop into something.  No, you're a geek.  Because they're bored.  Yeah.  They consider, you know what, one of the food groups.  So to them, you know, they kind of get their fill.  So it's a pretty funny show.  And they're cubing out parts of the girls because they're wearing such skimpy...  Oh, yeah, thongs.  Skimpy like lingerie type, well, boy shorts and baby doll type tops. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, little tops.  They got to cube everything out to keep it...  Keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  They had a competition where they brought in a model for them to draw and she comes out  in a robe and then takes the robe off and she's completely naked and their job is to  sketch the nude woman as she's sitting there laying down lounging on a little couch thing.  And a couple of them are like, that's the first naked woman I've ever seen. 
[00:21:00]  And all I was thinking is, oh, you know what, they're probably sporting at that point.  Yeah.  They're losing their minds.  Remember the first time you saw a real live naked woman?  What that did to you as a guy?  Yeah.  The heavy breathing, you would just freak out.  Palms are sweaty.  You're like freaking.  Just looking at it.  A real live in the flesh nude woman.  And these guys, it was the first time they were seeing it.  And then they tricked them because as they're drawing, the girl is kind of moving and talking. 
[00:21:30]  That was the best part of that challenge.  It was really, really smart.  Yeah, it was put together well.  So these guys can't draw worth a crap.  They're trying their best.  And they're just focusing and trying to get the best sketch because they think the challenge  is all about sketching a naked woman.  They were getting frustrated too because she's just yapping.  She won't shut up.  And they're trying to concentrate.  And then it turns out the challenge was not to draw her.  They then quizzed these guys on what she was talking about.  That was like the thing, to listen to what she's saying and answer questions based on what she was talking about. 
[00:22:00]  Some guys had no clue.  They didn't even know what her name was.  They couldn't get past her name.  Even though she came out and said, my name is whatever.  One guy, like two guys, they think I have the name right.  And then the contest ended after two questions.  Well, obviously, those are the two gay guys in the house.  Yeah.  Because they were listening.  And the one guy that won said, he goes, I noticed that she was talking a lot.  He goes, and just really babbling about like nothing.  He goes, so I kind of thought maybe I should listen to what she's saying because that might be part of this. 
[00:22:30]  Like he was on to it.  And that's the only reason he even won.  The rest of them were like, they didn't care.  They would just.  Take your pants off.  You got to shake them out like an umbrella when it's raining and you come to the house.  Yeah.  Believe me, if it was like Bob Ross, they wouldn't need any of that liquid white.  Right, right.  Put a little liquid white over here.  Seemed to run out of some liquid white, but I got some right here.  That's right.  I'll just use some that I seem to have.  You know what?  That could be a really good like kind of, you know, side topic today. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  First time you saw a naked girl.  Yeah, it was.  Well, you've heard about mine, of course.  Well, no, heiny wise, coolly wise, heiny.  It was that young kindergarten girl around the corner.  Right.  I was in kindergarten also.  And I used to go around the corner and we used to show each other, you know.  That was pretty much my first ever, ever look at any nudity on a girl.  But a woman, it was Buzz out there in California when I was, you know, 13 or so. 
[00:23:30]  And that feeling has never come back.  That first time you're like, oh, my God, this is the greatest thing ever.  Well, it was that ever.  That first time.  I'm talking about the first time.  Of course, the second time is almost as good as the first.  But that first time where you're like, holy crap.  Well, the first time, you know, Columbus seeing the land.  You know, that's the first was like, hey, land ho.  And then you spend the rest of the days trying to figure out what you want to do with the land. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, I do.  I remember walking.  And this girl, Christine, her name was, but her nickname was Buzz, sent me up to take a shower.  I still had no clue what was going on.  So I got out of the shower and I hear, are you coming in?  And she was in one of the bedrooms.  So I kind of like crept into the room and she was sitting on the bed.  Remember this so vividly.  She's sitting on the bed like with pillows propped up behind the headboard and leaning on it. 
[00:24:30]  And the sheets were pulled up to her waist.  So from the waist up, she was completely nude.  And that was the first like time I've ever seen that live.  And it was like, what?  How would I?  And then it clicked in my head, like instantly.  The first thought was like, what is going on?  What is she doing?  What?  Oh, my God.  This is it.  This is it.  You're losing your virginity.  Thanks to dear old dad.  This is it.  You failed to mention the dear old dad part. 
[00:25:00]  And then if I may use a wacky sound effect.  And after two seconds, it's over, Johnny.  Let's go watch Monty Python buzz.  But dad ordered buzz for you.  Yeah.  Well, she was a friend of the family.  And you were 13 and she was 19.  Oh, see, I always remember it as her being a lot older.  But it seemed like 13 and 19. 
[00:25:30]  That's pretty.  She might as well be 30 at that point.  What's the difference?  And then that just went on for that went on for months.  Yeah.  Maybe even a year.  Yeah.  Where it was like constant.  So I was going to school and, you know, my friends talking about, you know, you want  to go out and play or you want to do this?  And I was like, you want to go build a tree for?  And I never told him.  I'm high.  I didn't really brag about her.  Just a couple of my close friends.  What is wrong with you?  A couple of my close friends knew.  You know, because I didn't want to brag about it. 
[00:26:00]  I didn't want to wreck it either.  You didn't want to ruin it.  I didn't want to ruin it.  I was one of those smart kids.  Yeah, that's true.  Kids ruin it these days when they rat out.  Yeah.  They're banging their hot teacher.  And then they got to go blab to the freaking nerdy friend that doesn't get any.  Teacher's getting arrested.  And you're not getting it anymore.  Nerdy friend is all jealous.  So it goes and tells his mommy.  And the next thing you know, you're not you're not banging the hot teacher anymore.  All right, we got to take a break.  We got a lot to do.  It's the iShow with iOpie and iAnthony. 
[00:26:30]  Someone is calling us iYouKnowWhats.  Of course.  As long as I put the i in front of it.  Wait, you know what?  There could be 500 things that just flashed into my head.  What does it begin with?  Each one is appropriate.  Your ICSs?  Eye faggots?  Douches.  Pretty much eye faggots.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, it's Martin Luther King Day.  We're here live.  We got lots to do.  We have to talk about Michael Strahan.  Oh, did he get it?

[00:28:30]  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  Now I want to hear this song.  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  They were very musical people.  People.  Well, a radio show killed somebody.  Anthony and I were debating this before the show.  I think there was another radio show that actually killed someone as well.  I don't remember that one. 
[00:29:00]  I think there was a radio show that made believe.  This is an old, old-time radio bit, by the way.  A lot of stations have done this.  They make believe there's a huge celebrity in town.  And they kind of hint or they blatantly say,  Britney Spears is in town.  It usually happens in really, really small markets.  Yeah.  And then they rent, like, a limo for the day.  And then they have the limo going all over the place.  And it's like, you know, Britney Spears is in town.  I don't know why she's here.  I think she's filming a video.  And she needed our stupid town for the video. 
[00:29:30]  So if you see her, please let us know.  We know it's like a white limo, I think.  And then people call like crazy.  The white limo?  Oh, my God.  It's at the, uh, at Walmart.  Oh, they track it.  And all that crap.  And then, uh...  Oh, what a hack bit.  I think one of the radio stations did that.  And it created kind of a scene and somebody got trampled to death.  I do believe.  So this isn't the first radio death.  I could be wrong, though.  I could be wrong.  Maybe we can find that story.  I kind of remember that story, but I don't remember the person dying. 
[00:30:00]  But again, then I could be wrong.  I don't know.  But one thing we, uh, not, we're not wrong about.  Death from the Wii.  Yeah.  Hold your Wii for a Wii.  That's what they were calling it.  Ugh.  And they got a bunch of contestants in.  And they had to stand there, drink a bunch of water over a certain amount of time.  And, uh, the last one that had to relieve themselves, uh, one got the Wii.  The really important Wii. 
[00:30:30]  This is Hack Radio at its best.  Hold your Wii for a Wii.  Yeah.  Doesn't get any worse than that.  Well, uh, just in case you haven't heard, here's the news story.  28-year-old Jennifer Strange woke up early Friday morning hoping to win the hard-to-get Nintendo Wii.  The radio contest at 107.9 was called Hold Your Wii for a Nintendo Wii.  So the young mother of three had to keep drinking water without using the restroom.  According to another contestant, some of them drank for up to three hours.  We started out with little bottles, those mini bottles, and then we started out with the normal, like, bottle water-sized bottle. 
[00:31:00]  And then, um, just kept doing those every 10 minutes.  Vince Lundgren says he started feeling ill, then fell to the ground because of bladder pressure.  Soon after, he gave up.  On the way home, I started to have a headache.  And then, uh, I started to think to myself, like, I really need to get to bed.  I just feel horrible.  See, obviously, one of the other contestants in the Hold Your Wii for the Wii contest.  Yeah.  Honk, honk.  How about this?  If you're feeling bad and you're falling to the floor, how about just going to the bathroom? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  How about that?  How about walking to the bathroom?  No, Jimmy, then you don't win the Wii!  You've got to win the Wii.  You've got to win the Wii!  If you're endangering your health for the Wii, how about you just don't get it?  Buy it, right.  Just buy it.  People could say that about our eggnog drinking contest.  Yes, but...  So chill.  But no one's complaining about the eggnog contest, like, you know, like, I felt bad.  No, this is just an opportunist.  The guy obviously wants to sue or get some money out of it now.  He's probably bitter because he didn't win the Wii.  This radio show that put this on also is just one of these typical two guys and the hole. 
[00:32:00]  They got the hole in there.  Innocent.  They got a lot of celebrities on their show to interview.  They have certain bits they do on certain days of the week, you know, and they have a great relationship with, apparently, with a bunch of doctors, self-help people, psychiatrists, medical doctors, things like that, that they talk to on various days of the week. 
[00:32:30]  You can call in and tell them your problem, and they'll help you out.  Today on their show, they're going to have a grief counselor.  A grief counselor.  Yeah, to talk to all the listeners.  The grief counselor coming to your school.  Oh, was there anything creepier than that?  Bong.  Did you ever have to get that?  Oh, yeah.  Never got it.  My principal, back in grammar school, decided to do a little scuba diving out there in Waiting River.  Oh, no.  And we get the call at home, and then my mommy has to come up to my room and tell me that my principal died scuba diving. 
[00:33:00]  Who cared about your principal, though?  What grade were you in?  Grammar school?  It was all about the principal.  Who cared about her, though, or him?  It was a him.  Either one.  Are you kidding me?  During all my years in elementary school, I knew the principal could care less about him.  One of the most important people in our lives was our principal in grammar school.  Oh, my God.  We rallied around him.  He was the rah-rah guy.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, I never cared about a teacher or a principal in my life. 
[00:33:30]  I've had teachers bite it over the years and could care less.  I couldn't tell you who my principal was in junior high or high school or whatever, but, yeah, the grammar school principal was pretty important at Washington Drive School.  But you liked him?  Really?  Me, personally?  Like anyone else.  The kids rallied around him in a good way?  Absolutely.  Oh, I never expected the principal.  We all cried when we found out the principal died. 
[00:34:00]  And then we go to school, and there's the grief counselor.  If any of you guys have any questions about death, so-and-so is here to answer all your questions.  Where do you go?  Huh?  Where do you go?  Ask him that.  Where do you go?  I, well.  I, um.  You're a grief counselor.  Why did they take, why did God take the principal?  Uh, mysterious ways, um, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera. 
[00:34:30]  Uh, we can't find the body.  Uh, we're assuming it's kind of floating at the bottom of, uh, the long-and-so.  Oh, no.  Did they not find it?  And fish are just pecking at his, uh, at his skull as we speak here.  Uh, we're hoping to fish him out sometime tomorrow.  Should wash up on shore when the currents change, uh, this spring.  Right.  Stupid grief counselor.  And then you got, I mean, you know, we had a story here recently.  You know, you get the, you get the high school kids drive a little too fast. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  That happened to me also.  Everyone dies.  And then of course, grief counselor for, for the coming days to try to get you through it.  Um, they were, uh, there was these three kids and they were all stoned out of the garden.  They were driving down the Ortega highway in California.  Ortega highway looks like takes, take some yarn and throw it on the floor.  And you know how it'll just wind and wind around.  That's what the road looked like.  It was that windy and unpredictable.  You didn't know when a turn was coming up.  No guardrails, just a horrific piece of highway. 
[00:35:30]  And, uh, three kids from our school, uh, Dana Hills high school went, uh, driving off the,  an embankment.  One kid was in the back of the hatchback and, uh, they found out through, you know, looking  at the wreck, what, what had happened.  Yeah.  He bounced out the back and he may have been thrown clear of the vehicle and been okay.  But at the last minute, the hatchback slammed down on his arm.  Like he was almost out of the vehicle, slammed down on his arm. 
[00:36:00]  And he just rolled down the mountain with the car and clipped to his arm.  And that's how they found him.  He was so close to being thrown from the wreck.  And that would have saved his life.  Yeah.  And, uh, again, grief counselors.  But I just thought, I always looked at school like war and it's just whatever.  Some people just don't make it.  And that was it.  I don't know.  We were a close knit, uh, community.  Community.  So I don't know.  I mean, it was a real bummer when he died. 
[00:36:30]  I mean, and you don't understand death at that age for the most part.  Most kids are lucky enough not to understand death until a little older in their lives.  Yeah.  So to be like, uh, I don't even remember, probably like 10, maybe 11.  See, that's unhealthy.  That was the first person I remember dying.  It's unhealthy for kids.  You should just leave it alone and go, ah, the principal went away.  He had to get another job.  We got another principal.  Handle it like a sitcom character.  Yeah.  Oh, he's off in Paris studying.  No, you get another guy and just put him there and never acknowledges another guy. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  Just another guy shows up and says, I'm him and that's it.  Principal Darren Stevens is now Principal Darren Stevens as played by, uh, Dick York.  But the old principal didn't have any hair.  The new principal has hair.  I mean, the same principal now has hair.  You know, three episodes in, you don't even remember the old guy.  You're like, eh, this guy's just as good.  I just don't get liking the principal.  Like, to me, the death part's important.  Like, it's shocking when someone's gone, you don't get death.  But, like, I never liked the principal.  The principal was a horrifying disciplinarian aspect of the school. 
[00:37:30]  I hated him.  The concept of it.  In grammar school?  Every.  Yeah.  I understand that from, like, sixth grade on.  But for us, it was just like, I don't know.  Authoritarian.  Yeah.  The only time I saw the principal was when I was in some type of trouble.  Yes.  Whether it was big trouble or the little trouble, but it was some kind of problem.  It was never good work.  You were getting in trouble in grammar school, really?  Yeah, for stupid things, like mischievous and breaking things.  Like, I talk about how I broke a kid's thermos.  Yeah.  Just for the hell of it, because I wanted to hear the sound of the glass in the thermos 
[00:38:00]  break.  So I broke it.  Some kid ratted me out.  And there I was.  Where did they send me?  A teacher's office?  The gym teacher's office?  No.  I went to the principal.  And that's what I thought about the principal.  I could care less if they lived or died.  All right.  Let's get back on the highway, because we're talking about this Hold Your Wee for the Wee.  These, by the way, these characters, their names are Maney.  The guy is Maney.  The other guy is Lucas.  And Trish is the girl.  And they have, like, these little get-to-know-you pages on the website. 
[00:38:30]  It's a little blog thing.  Oh, they're just douches.  And biographies, blogs.  By the way, the website is up.  They're called The Morning Rave.  Oh, my God.  Or The Morning Grave.  The Morning Grave, right.  Okay, all right.  But their website is still up.  And they're not acknowledging that they killed one of their listeners.  There isn't one acknowledgement that these people killed a listener, perhaps.  And the lady that died, did she win the contest? 
[00:39:00]  Like, does her family get the Wee, at least?  Um, Opie, no.  She didn't even win the contest?  She didn't even win the contest.  Someone else won, I gather.  Oh, God.  Is it wrong to say that she deserved what she got for enjoying this radio program?  This is, though, it's The Morning Rave.  And they put exclamation points, which is always a sign of good writing.  But one of the questions they asked, Manny, what was the last movie that made you cry?  And his answer is Star Wars Episode 3.  Dash, Anakin is so mean to Obi-Wan! 
[00:39:30]  Stop it.  You made that up.  No, I didn't.  You made that up.  Stop it.  No, I didn't.  Can you at least lie and tell me you did?  Because I don't want to think that there is someone in the world like that.  All right, here goes.  Last movie that made you laugh so hard that you, uh...  Now, they'll dump out of this.  Let's just say that you did what they were trying to avoid doing in this one.  Exactly.  And his answer was, Escape from Alcatraz, Dash.  Jail movies make me laugh! 
[00:40:00]  How about an honest answer, faggot?  What is your favorite cereal?  Fruity Pebbles.  On the paper, did it say, Insert Crazy Name of Cereal here?  Right, yeah.  How about the one you like the most?  Why not just answer it?  Everything doesn't have to be...  Who's laughing, though?  Dana Ricker.  Fruity Pebbles.  Funny couple of words.  Fruity Pebbles.  It's Maney.  He's incorrigible.  There it is on the news. 
[00:40:30]  Deadly contest they just showed.  All right, listen.  This is getting pressed.  It's got legs.  It's got legs, and that means we're going to be dragged into the story.  All the crazy things that radio shows have done include...  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm conceding defeat to these people.  Remember when Star came in?  Yeah.  And he was saying he gets the title now because he...  Kiss the ring.  Kiss the ring.  Kiss the ring.  Kiss the ring was threatening...  Kiss my ass.  ...was threatening some other personality's child and trying to find...  Kiss my ass.  ...where the school was for the child. 
[00:41:00]  And there was...  You know, that's all fine and well.  We had the Sex for Sam thing, and now these guys win.  When you actually kill a listener, you win.  By the way, I got this story about the Britney Spears thing.  Oh.  So we got that.  We got the second clip about the hold your wee for the wee, and then we'll talk about this  morning rave show for a little while because they're just beyond hacky.  You know, to all the people out there trying to, like, get their own radio show together, 
[00:41:30]  we rarely give advice on the Opie and Anthony show to the newcomers out there.  Here's our advice today.  Mm-hmm.  Avoid the whole.  Yes.  Anthony and I have been doing this show for about 12 years now, maybe a little more,  and stupid management has come to us on many occasions and said, what you need on your  show is a woman.  Woman's point of view.  Also known as the whole.  They say a woman's alternate point of view, I think, would help on the...  If you have a woman on your show, then we could get more female listeners, and that 
[00:42:00]  would help your overall ratings and blah, blah, blah.  Shut the F up.  Avoid the whole.  Watch out, whole.  Let the holes do their own show.  Get a brutal chick that's funny.  Don't find one that's going to tsk, tsk you like you get at home.  Who wants that?  Oh, guys.  Oh, guys.  Oh, she's dead, guys.  Oh, look what you did.  Gosh.  Jeepers, guys.  All right.  We'll continue with this story.  It's very interesting.  It's going to be all over the news today, and I'm sure we're going to be getting the 
[00:42:30]  phone calls to go on Fox News Channel and MSNBC.  Every time there's some kind of crazy radio show story, they give us a call.  Yeah, we get a little...  And we say no every single time.  We don't want any part of this horse crap.  Sky, I had one enjoyable answer.  What is your guilty pleasure?  I eat my boogers.  Ugh.  That I don't mind.  It's wacky.  I bet he doesn't even.  All right.  Then I don't like it.  If he does, I respect his honesty.  All right.  We'll regroup.  We'll continue down this path.  We've got the Binghamton...  It's from Binghamton, by the way. 
[00:43:00]  The Britney Spears hoax.  What's your guilty pleasure?  I like to kill listeners.  Jim Jones in the morning.  Douchebags.  Yeah, we're going to have a little fun with this story while we get back.  That's for sure.  And then we've got to eventually talk about the Missouri boys.  That is just a creepy story as well.  Oh, yeah.  I don't even know.  I've got some thoughts.  I don't know what goes on.  We've got some thoughts.  We'll get into that as well.  And, of course, to Michael Strahan and lots of other things. 
[00:43:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The iShow.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Fire.  Fuck!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  It's the Opie and Anthony F.U. Line.  When you feel like telling someone to fuck off and you don't want to do it to their face,  call 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  And give them a healthy, hearty, fuck you.  Call today.  Fuck you!  Fuck! 
[00:44:00]  Fuck you!  Fuck you, you fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Ah, boy.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  The iShow.  The iShow.  Everything with an I in front of it is successful.  So we're trying something different.  The iPod, iMac, iPhone coming out.  So why not just use simple semantics?  It's a quick little name change.  iShow.  iOpie.  iAnthony. 
[00:44:30]  iJim.  iRock.  iRock.  Of course it doesn't work with him.  iFan.  iFan.  iFan.  Ah, ha, ha.  He waved back.  Ah, well, yeah.  He thought we said hi.  Ugh.  All right, we're in the middle of talking about this show, I guess, in Sacramento,  called The Morning Rave.  The Morning Rave.  They're changing their name to The Morning Grave, of course.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Apparently, allegedly, until more information is in from the coroner, early reports are their 
[00:45:00]  contest killed a listener.  And this dope didn't even win the Wii.  No, she didn't win.  She was trying to win it for her kids.  She backed out.  But obviously, there's going to be something else that comes out of this, that she has  some kind of medical condition.  Yes.  You think?  I've heard it's almost impossible to die from drinking too much water.  A lot of people do it at college hazings.  Yeah, I've heard it's possible, but the amount of water you've got to drink is beyond ridiculous.  I think it all depends on what you did the day before, how your, yeah, your health in general. 
[00:45:30]  But I bet if she didn't drink so much water, she'd probably still be alive.  You know?  So it contributed.  But she has, yeah, I'm sure, but she has something else going on.  Billy in Connecticut.  Well, there's actually something that will kill you if you drink too much water.  There's a condition medically where if you have kidneys that are made of paper.  Yes, paper kidneys will do that.  Billy, what's up?  The paper kidney disease.  Hey, O.P., I remember you guys doing a similar contest on the other station in New York.  Of course we did.  Tell them, Fred. 
[00:46:00]  It was just a little bit different, Dopey.  You tied a bandana around your kidneys.  Tell them, Fred.  Tell them, Fred.  We did this.  We did it all.  But it was just a different way.  The guy, you taped their legs so that when they peed, it didn't go down their legs.  Well, you're not using the proper terminology.  Yeah, Billy, you're an eye dope.  Yeah.  Just sit there in Eye Connecticut and shut up.  Yeah.  All right, thank you, Billy.  He's getting dumped out. 
[00:46:30]  Owl's not going to allow that.  Not I, Owl.  Come on, I, Owl.  I dump out of it, Pookie.  Oh, yeah.  Owl.  Owl.  What do you say, Owl?  God forbid we talk about the potty.  Yeah.  God forbid.  God forbid we talk about something that, I don't know, five-year-olds talk about, four-year-olds.  Infants.  The same language.  If we're trying to protect the children, and that's what this whole FCC thing has always 
[00:47:00]  been about, how come we can't use terminology that is commonly used on a daily basis by parents  and children?  How is it offensive when a parent says to a child, do you have to go wee-wee?  The kids say it.  How is it hurting?  A kid will turn it on.  Now, the big thing has always been, well, a parent will be driving a car and accidentally  turn on your station, and their child will hear something offensive.  Why dump out of that when it is terminology that is completely accepted by community standards, 
[00:47:30]  which is what they say in the FCC language, and by parents and spoken by children.  Please riddle me that, Duke.  I'm going to challenge Owl right now.  Come on, Owl.  Because we're talking about the wee.  Weeing for the wee, right?  Yep.  You know there's the N-word?  Uh-huh.  There's also the P-word.  Right.  Uh.  I think I got it through. 
[00:48:00]  Yes.  Yeah, it starts with the letter P.  Right.  It's the P-word.  Right.  How about this?  Will they-  I got it through again.  If I said, uh, hey, man, I'll be right back.  I have to pee.  Um.  Ah, no.  That's okay?  Oh, that's fine now?  Oh, cool.  Who can keep track of this crap?  Oh, the rest of the radio is so edgy.  It's, uh, the-  I can say that to me?  No, my God.  It's the context.  All right.  It's the context. 
[00:48:30]  How about I drank so much I had to pee?  Can I say that?  Uh.  You're crazy.  No offense to the parents that might have heard that.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you drink a lot of water.  You just can't then turn it around.  Yeah, absolutely.  Do that in reverse.  I pay the woman to drink a lot of water.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then I gargled.  Yeah.  All right.  So.  Oh.  They dumped out of something there.  We're back to the story.  Yeah, we're back to the story in Sacramento.  This, uh, this, uh, show, The Morning Rave, they had a bunch of contestants come in.  They drank water.  And you had a hold your wee. 
[00:49:00]  The last person to hold their wee got the wee.  One girl, uh, backs out.  She bails and, uh, she goes home and she dies.  And they're saying because she drank too much water.  Here's the second part of the news story.  Jennifer Strange also gave up.  A co-worker says she called her office soon after in tears, saying she felt ill and couldn't make it in.  Family members later found her unresponsive in her Rancho Cordova home.  According to the preliminary autopsy, the cause of death is consistent with water intoxication. 
[00:49:30]  Her co-workers at Radiological Associates, where she worked as a medical secretary for six years, were stunned by the news.  They say Jennifer was an outgoing, intelligent young woman who was known for superior customer service.  Outgoing, all right.  They mourn her loss.  They also worry about the health of the other contestants.  I see how radio stations want to have a good time, you know, and want to attract listeners.  And, you know, they're trying to do it in a playful way.  And at the same time, you know, responsibility is always the most important thing.  Yeah, how about this?  Oh, shut up.  That's a dumb listener. 
[00:50:00]  Stop drinking water.  When you're done drinking water, stop it.  Give up on the contest.  How about that?  Um, I might be wrong here.  So correct me.  These things are available in stores.  Oh, yeah.  Well, they're a hot item there for a while.  Oh, buy it.  But they've, uh, they re-stocked the shelves.  You can get your Wii.  I'm looking at that family.  Oof.  It's the Verizon poster guy, a woman with a thin head, two horrible children, and some 
[00:50:30]  other genderless mullet thing in the upper left-hand part.  Some Joyce DeWitt-headed pseudo-dyke in the corner.  It's horrible.  Well, uh, that is the family, and, uh, of course, their comment, we miss her dearly.  Yeah.  Spelled as in the Wii spells it.  It is so odd that they're the, we, we, we, W-I-I, miss her dearly.  Uh, said William Strange.  That is a strange family. 
[00:51:00]  It is.  It's going to be William Misshapen Head, because they are the worst head shapes I've ever seen  on four different individuals.  Well, obviously, it looks like they're filled with water, those heads.  Oh, oh.  But I'm bumping.  Look at this kid's skull.  This kid's skull, it's awful.  Look at how long his head is.  Yeah.  Yeah, but now he doesn't have a mommy, so you gotta feel for the kid.  I didn't say I'm glad his mother's dead, I'm just saying his head is awful. 
[00:51:30]  I had that turn to me being the bad guy.  You actually didn't.  Because Rocky Dennis' mother doesn't know when to stop drinking water.  How about this whore, when you have to go, say I give up and go sit on the ball.  Stop.  Give yourself a break.  More advice for, uh, brand new radio shows out there.  Mm-hmm.  Do not do the online bio.  I think we did one online bio.  Yeah.  To be fair, I think back at WAF.  Yeah, like our first gig together.  They asked, like, you know, favorite bands, favorite movie, favorite TV show, stuff like 
[00:52:00]  that, really just mundane, who gives a crap stuff.  I think I left half of it out, and for movies and stuff like that, it was your basics, you  know, that I always put.  And, uh, ever since, uh, radio companies will try to get you to do an online bio so the listeners  get to know you a little better.  And they always end up making it just a little wacky to show how funny they are.  But not offensive.  No, don't make it offensive now, guys.  If you're going to be funny, be funny.  If you want to be serious, be serious.  But don't be cutesy.  Cutesy is just horrid. 
[00:52:30]  So with the morning rave out there in Sacramento, they got, uh, like you guys said, Lucas, uh,  Manny, and Trish the Dish.  Trish the Dish.  Trish the Dish.  Nice.  And they have questions that they have to answer so you, the listener, get to know the,  uh, participants of your favorite morning show.  Oh, and Lucas, uh, who do you want to start with?  Lucas?  Um, Lucas, I don't think is as bad as Manny.  I think it's Manny because it's M-A-N-E-Y.  All right, Manny, yes.  I'm guessing.  Um, I, I don't think he's as bad because he kind of tells at least a little bit of the 
[00:53:00]  truth.  All right, why don't we read through these, uh, if you will, there, eh?  Uh, what was the last movie that made you cry?  Napoleon Dynamite.  I laughed so hard I was crying.  All right, he's a douche.  That's not, that's not the gist of the question.  The last movie that made you cry would be a movie like Ghost.  Yeah, but he's trying to be, he's trying to be funny.  Yeah, he's trying to be funny with that.  Last movie that made you cry.  Who would laugh at that?  I mean, I would laugh at the movie Napoleon Dynamite, but who would laugh at that answer  to that question?  I would have laughed if he wrote, uh, oh no, that's, that's, I would have put a comedy. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  I screwed up.  Last movie that made you laugh so hard that you, you know, lost control of your faculties.  Uh, I don't lose control of my faculty.  I tinkle.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Guilty pleasure?  If you had your own reality TV show, what would you call it?  What did my dog Gilly eat?  That's only funny if he's in France and his wife was on drugs and fell asleep and the dog ate half of her face. 
[00:56:00]  That is kind of funny.  There you go.  Like, it's a funny show name.  And I stand corrected.  This guy wasn't honest.  He's a total drunk.  No.  Manny.  All right, let's go to Manny.  Manny or whatever the hell his name is.  Manny, Manny.  Who gives a crap?  This guy should be executed.  What was the last movie that made you cry?  Star Wars Episode 3.

[00:58:30]  Bart Simpson, dot, dot, dot, always up to no good.  Ah, did you see that jerk?  What kind of no good is this guy up to?  What are you doing?  That rivals Bart Simpson.  Aside from, you know, killing somebody.  Exactly.  Except for the fact that maybe you like to play bobbing for apples in another gentleman's lap.  What are you up to?  That's no good.  Uh, which actor, actress would you like to play, uh, you in a movie, if a movie was made 
[00:59:00]  about your life?  Eddie Murphy, wear the same skin tone.  Know why that's so funny?  Because he's so pale.  Because he's so white.  I'm looking at his picture.  He is so pale.  See, that's the.  Hmm.  Uh, what is your guilty pleasure?  I eat my boogers.  Oh, my God.  Exactly.  And, uh, finally, if you were to have your own reality TV show, what would it be called? 
[00:59:30]  Waking Up Early Sucks.  The, the, like, this is why you don't, you're, you're right.  Here's a little lesson in, uh, radio.  Because it's really tough to, to, to, to, to write funny.  First of all, you don't make up the questions.  A stupid program director, a, a, a, a jackass, untalented program director writes up the questions  thinking he's creative.  He wants to be part of the creative process.  So he writes up the questions thinking that his on-air staff is going to come up with some 
[01:00:00]  wacky, funny, hysterical answers.  See, answering these type of questions, it's really tough to be funny no matter what.  I mean, you can be funny writing a blog or, or what have you, but to, to, to get answers  to these hacky questions, it's almost impossible.  We get, uh, requests to do interviews like this where the, the writer can't call us or  make it, so they email these questions to us and we refuse to ever do them.  Cause they want you to give some kind of funny answer to every question. 
[01:00:30]  And they are so stupid in, in their writing that there's no way you can make it funny.  I think, uh, I don't know.  I think these questions do have a little bit of a maneuvering room to be amusing in.  Oh, I think that, would you like to take one on?  Maybe not at the moment, but I'd say by the next commercial break, perhaps you can maybe  come up with a, at least a couple.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just use the same questions and we'll get Jimmy's answer.  Only because I think that, that the, the, these guys are just so awful. 
[01:01:00]  Awful.  These are the bios to, uh, yeah, the morning show that killed one of their listeners with  the holds your we for we, uh, for a we.  They are so fired by the way.  So fired.  And what's up with Trish the dish?  Here's the dish on Trish.  Ew.  Trish the dish.  Her hobbies, surfing, hiking, basketball, running, telling lame jokes, playing on MySpace,  quoting movie lines, people watching, reading trashy gossip magazines, getting manicures 
[01:01:30]  and pedicures, shopping, singing out of tune, acting a fool.  Acting a fool.  I bet she's wild after a few cocktails.  Dogg tales.  Uh, likes being outdoors.  Roman tubs.  The hell is that?  Roman tug?  Washing off the stain of a war helmet.  Perhaps.  Basketball, uh, pickup basketball, traveling.  Optimism. 
[01:02:00]  Ooh, she's an optimist.  Mexican food, camping, and red, red wine.  Those don't go together.  Yeah.  And leave a big stinky one behind a tree.  attracting wild animals 20 minutes later bears attacking the tent dogs over cats  well i say cats over dogs you've told trish the dish a good sushi joint black and white photography  hey she likes sunsets too oh the ocean so does everyone that means you live through another day  no kidding who hates who hates sunset sunseting depresses me no one cares about sunsets i'm sure

[01:04:00]  uh and and are never going to turn the smell of french onion soup which might smell like her feet  when her shoes are on and she's not wearing socks see it's so it's not that hard to be funny on these  things jesus jimmy oh my god jimmy just summed it up in one word what he disliked  he put dislikes crossed out all of her dislikes and wrote one word that is very inappropriate oops 
[01:04:30]  on this day her dislikes you don't know if she doesn't dislike uh that she probably beds them  she also dislikes uh having to pay on the first date slow internet connections  margaritas with big chunky grains of salt it's a great way to drink margaritas around the top of  the glass and all music by jamara kwai when was this written jesus he hasn't been relevant in 15 years

[01:06:00]  a lawsuit over woman's death in britney spears hoax this is the one i was uh referring to earlier  anthony in binghamton new york an appeals court in new york has dismissed a multi-million dollar  lawsuit brought by a man whose wife died during a radio station's britney spears hoax dismissed it  uh the woman died six years ago after falling and hitting her head outside a radio station in  binghamton new york she was part of a crowd who rushed after a limo they believed had singer britney  spears inside it was really a spears impersonator oh this is one of the oldest gags in radio by the 
[01:06:30]  way like we explained a little earlier her husband sued the station's owner clear channel alleging fraud  and negligence the state uh appellate court dismissed the case saying the husband could improve the radio  station's stunt caused the events that led to his wife's death uh patholal uh patholal pathologist  sorry ruled the uh the mother of three died after the heart after her heart went out of rhythm as a  result of the blow to her head uh the woman's 10 year old daughter was with her when he fell

[01:20:00]  That they answered  That they had to answer  On their website  And Jimmy Norton  Took the liberty  Of filling it out  What was the last movie  That made you cry  Downfall  Was a good one  Last movie  That made you laugh  So hard  You lost your  Faculties  Jimmy Wright's  Roots  Favorite cereal  I've never heard  Of this one  Perhaps it was  Always in the back  Behind like 
[01:20:30]  The other  It was on the top shelf  It was hard to find it  Jewberry crunch  Do you ever forward  Chain letters  You get in your email  No I'm too busy  Pretending to be  Thirteen in a chat room  Okay  Alright  You brought some humor  To this  Something with it  And again  Believe me  If this was not  Being read of a  Terrestrial radio  These would be brutal  Of course  What do you listen to  In your car  Any way to work 
[01:21:00]  The prostitute  Trying to kick her way  Out of my trunk  Out of the trunk  Sorry  Sorry  What's under your bed  Child pornography  If you were a bar of soap  Whose soap dish  Would you like to sit in  Andrea Yates  There you go  That was the obvious answer  Quite a view  Number one answer  On the board  What song would you consider  To be your theme song  These are a few of my  Favorite things  But only when sung 
[01:21:30]  By John Wayne Gacy  Have you ever purchased  Anything from an infomercial  And if so  What  Jim writes  The Ben Franklin  Commemorative dish  And tampon set  I remember  I was going to pick  One of those up  Which cartoon character

[01:22:30]  One all right  And I don't know  How much pleasure  You'd get from it  But  Well it's not necessarily  That part of it  It's just the cleaning  The blood out of the sheets  And pretending it's  Cranberry juice  And  If  There were a reality  TV show  If you were to have  Your own reality  TV show  What would it be called  Thanks for the log  How much do I owe you 
[01:23:00]  See again  It could be written  Enough  Funny  Just very accurate  Well  Here's the problem  The station wants you  To be edgy  With your answers  But not too edgy  Of course  Don't get crazy  You either do it  Or you don't do it  That's what Jimmy's  Pretty much  And believe me  For online  You can be much  Better than that  Oh yeah  You don't have to be red  There's just so much  More you can do  If you're going to be funny  Just be funny  Whatever your idea 
[01:23:30]  Funny is  But no one  No one could actually  Think  Bart Simpson  I'm always  What does he say  Bart Simpson  There's always a problem  Always some kind of a problem  Always up to no good  Always up to no good  As his favorite  What cartoon character  Yeah who he relates to  Because he's up to no good  Right  Alright well there you go  We'll put that to bed  For now  But that show is  So fired  So fired  You can't have a listener  Die and not get fired  Put it to bed  On a little  Soggy satin pillow 
[01:24:00]  They fired us  After the Sex for Sam thing  And that was  Admitting guilt  Admitting that they  They knew all about it  And stuff  Yeah but  You just have to do  The quote  Right thing  In the corporate world  I still don't think  It was the right thing  But they certainly  Did what they thought  They had to do  To save the company  Those lawyers work  They're awful  Yeah they're so fired  It might be  They might last another  Oh wait  Yeah they're gone by tomorrow  Yeah  Yeah it's gonna be quick  She's gonna have

[01:25:00]  Stupid  That is really horrible  You think they got a wee  At the funeral home  To keep the kids occupied  I hope so  You know  Just let them play  Forget about the whole thing  Forget about the horror  At the front of the room  Yeah  Have the wee set up in the back  As someone dumps some tetras and garamis  In the coffin  Oh Anthony  Oh stop  Oh I'm  Guys 
[01:25:30]  Yeah  Sorry  Alright  She's the one I wanted to play  Drank a lot of water  She's thirsty  All right  Something bad  She's changing gear  Dead  Really quick  Here's your  Try the water  Here's your  Here's your David Caruso CSI  Line of the day  Oh no  Line of the day  Is it a new one  It's a new one  I understand the blood pool 
[01:26:00]  And the spatter  But his pants  That's a swipe  Isn't it  What about that  Possibly transfer  From our killer  Probably somebody  He knew  Yes and soon  So will we  David Caruso CSI  Our new fave  Our new favorite thing  Jimmy  Has he always been that much  That's what I said  Yeah 
[01:26:30]  He stinks on ice  Go to you  He's great  NYPD Blue  Go to you  Was he  I'm going to have to see  Like old ones  Very good in season one  Yes  Jimmy  Was his delivery  While you were in  Vegas at the Porn Awards  We discovered this thing  On YouTube  It's a montage  Of David Caruso  One liners  One after another  Brasho  Looks like a fisherman  Just found Melissa Rowe's body  Bad news is  The verdict's already in 
[01:27:00]  The verdict is in Frank  But the jury's out  That's when the show starts  Like he has a dramatic moment  He puts his sunglasses on  Delivers his line  Exits stage left even  He exits the frame  And then  The theme kicks in  For the beginning of the show  And it's so bad  His delivery  Is horrible  What a tool 
[01:27:30]  With no movies  That were good  Oh where's the third one  Oh boy  Frank  The war may be staged  But the murderous wheel  Looks like  This radio contest winner  Is all wet  Yeah so now we're doing  The delivery  With other movies  Jimmy  We're using the Caruso  School of acting here 
[01:28:00]  Caruso's school of acting  Hacky line  You don't acknowledge  The hacky line  Because dramatic  Roger Daltry  Scream right after  Yeah of course  Here's from Cobra  I don't want to talk to you  Now you bring in  The television cameras  In here now  Come on bring it in  Can't do that  Why  I don't deal with psychos  I put them away  I ain't no psycho man  I'm a hero  You're looking at  A f***ing hunter  I'm a hero  Of the new world  You're a disease 
[01:28:30]  And I'm the cure  See it works  With the daltry scream  Yeah  Isn't that hard  To listen to  That's douche and douche  Oh yeah  Well we got some Arnold  I don't deal with psychos  Just a tough cop  With the little matchstick  Yeah matchstick  I don't deal with psychos  Here's  Put it away  And who else you don't deal with  Letting it go  Rocky 6 
[01:29:00]  That's who you don't do  Excuse me  Excuse me  I have an announcement  To make  Over this very weekend  I watched  Rocky Balboa  The latest installment  In the Rocky Saga  And  It was really good  I was so pissed  I went into it  Didn't go  I laid in my bed  And what 
[01:29:30]  But  But  I  Started watching it  Wanting to just  Laugh at it  Like  There's nothing on  Let me throw this on  And just get it over with  So I could goof on it  On Monday  And  It  It was good  The goddamn movie  Was good  It  It brought back  A lot from the original  The feel of the original Rocky  I think the directing  Was good  Did he direct it?  Yeah  He directed it  It was good  The fight scene  Is a lot more realistic  The way the camera was 
[01:30:00]  Anyway  And  And the story  Was basic  But  Are you buying it?  It had some hokey moments  Believe me  I was going to say  Are you buying into the fact  That he's a really old fighter  And he's able to  You know  Go toe to toe  With the new guy  Like that?  Well  You got to kind of  That would take me  Right out of the freaking movie  You got to tuck that away  You do  You got to tuck that away  It's not so much about  Rocky being in this great shape  And they're not acknowledging  The fact that he's old  It's that  He's like  Got such heart 
[01:30:30]  And such  You know  Spirit  That he can overcome  Anything like that  So he gets  You know  In the ring  With this big guy  Who by the way  Is kind of  Taking it a little lightly  Because it's supposed to be  Some kind of  Exhibition match thing  And  They battle it out  In the ring  And  There's a lot of story  Before the fight  And stuff  And it's a lot like  The first Rocky was  So I thought  I thought it was really good  They're working on it  Actually  They are doing another one  Oh are they  Where Rocky's an older man  And his joint ache 
[01:31:00]  He fights the urge  To put Bengay on them  Because that's a sign  Of being old  That's what he should be doing  Just rubbing Bengay  On his stupid shoulders  Arthritis is disease  Bengay's the cure  Hey  Speaking of the  David Caruso thing  So we got the total recall  From Arnold Schwarzenegger  Let's see  Let's see if the  David Caruso style  Of acting works with this  Or can jazz up  This clip from Arnold  Sweetheart  Be reasonable  After all  We're married  Consider that a divorce 
[01:31:30]  We're on to something  To catch a predator  Who put these together  Are they good  Oh boy  A listener sentiment  Oh boy  Oh no  Oh boy  Alright grab  This is where the bit goes bad  Grab the handle  Oh boy  Of your ejection seats  Right now  It's right there  Between your legs  Oh boy  Just grab the handle  And if we get 
[01:32:00]  A flame out  Pull  You'll eject out of the top  Ah well  Be careful  Hold on  Let's give it a try  Some listeners  You know  They understand  What we're doing  With the David Caruso  Acting style here  So they're finding  Other clips and things  That might work  With the David Caruso  Delivery  We hope that  Roger Daltry's screen  Yeah  Roisman 2000  Tells the decoy  He's completely shaved  In his private area  Asking in graphic detail  What girl wants to give oral sex 
[01:32:30]  When a man isn't shaved  I know I  Oh forget it  Okay hold on  Whoever handed this to me  Should be fired  Where are they  Simple as that  Where's the new  Simple as that  Where's the new  Fired person  Whoever handed that to me  Should be just  F'ing fired  Where's the fired person  Who did not listen to that  Are you kidding  Al isn't going to allow this  Al  Al  Because he's the guilty party  In the clip  Oh you sprained your finger  Al  Okay  How the F is Al  Going to ever accept that 
[01:33:00]  Who gave that to Al  Oh the finger of guilt  Got  E-Rock  Did you  E-Rock  I-Rock  Look he looks like  He's going to cry  Why wouldn't you  Why wouldn't you give that to Al  Don't yell at him  Listen to this  Because these guys  Want to play this today  Don't yell at him  He's going to cry  He should cry  Oh look at his eyes  I would cry if I was you  Because that's the only way  It's going to save your job  Because then we'll feel  Sorry for you  Yeah did you listen to that  At all  I-Rock  We got it  During the XM show  On Friday  So we put it on the disc 
[01:33:30]  But that's like a whole  Friday  That's a whole weekend  To find out if  Anything in there  We run things down the hall  To Al all the time  We can't say  You know there's a certain  What that thing is saying  There's a certain type  Of sex act  That cannot be described  On the air  Like that  Yeah  Blank sex  Doesn't work  On regular radio  It involves  We can talk around that still  But you can't blatantly  Say blank sex  Right  It involves a female  Above the waist  That might 
[01:34:00]  That might now  Above the neck  That might dump out  Blank sex now  But who knows  Who knows  Who knows how it works  Down the hall  I don't know  Al knows  What do you say Al  But  Now did you listen to it  Of course not  Why would you  Wait wait  Super fast  So was it fast  Super fast  See  But how would you  I'm not even busting  I'm stunned  How would anybody give that  Without listening to it 
[01:34:30]  To see if there was  An F-bomb moment  Or something  And E-Rock  By the way  You know when I  But you know  Broadcast television  When they're doing  The sex predator thing  We've had instances before  Where we couldn't  Just play it  Because it's too  Graphically sexual  Holy ass  Holy ass  Oh my Jesus  And by the way  Don't even say  You didn't have enough time  Because once again  Ten minutes late  That's not  Ten minutes late  Oh boy  Wait a minute  Now he said it's not true  Keep track of when  E-Rock shows up to work  Ten minutes late  There's an E-Rock clock 
[01:35:00]  It says ten minutes late  And an Anthony clock  Which says seven minutes  And that isn't late  That's right  That's the Anthony racism clock  They're starting to time me  On when the first racist word  Comes out of my mouth  Seven minutes today  I dropped an N-bomb  In the office  Would you doze off for five  When you first walked in  What took you so long  It was some news story  Respect for the holiday  I blurted it out  Sorry  As soon as they mentioned  The holiday  No  It was some news story  About some shenanigans  That went on up in the Bronx  And someone's saying 
[01:35:30]  Why could Dateline  Use those words on TV  But you can't on the radio  Exactly  We're agreeing with it  We agree with that  But the problem is  If we play it  They're gonna dump out  Down the stupid hall  Do you honestly think  We're sitting here  Upset and offended  That that was put through  We want the F word  On the air  Believe me  But we know  That it's not gonna get through  And it's just gonna be  Chopped out  And the people that are listening  Will go  What was that  So that's why  We get upset  Not the fact that  It was in there 
[01:36:00]  In the first place  We would love to  Have it be played  Holy crap  People gotta wake up  Around here  They gotta wake up  Wake up  Oh my god  Clip was getting hot  It was getting good too  I was waiting for the  Yeah  The big Roger D scream  We were building  You know  The bit was building  Building  Building  Building  That would have been  A nice ending to it  Instead  We look at Iraq  And we have to yell at him again  It's a rookie mistake  He's not dead  It's a rookie mistake  But obviously 
[01:36:30]  Iraq  Has gone deaf  Now Iraq is saying  That the 10 minute late thing  Was not true  So what do you  Not true  It's more like  20  What  It's not true  What's not true  That I was here  10 minutes late  I was here on time  With the time stamp  Of when I got my  What is your parking ticket  He's got evidence  Wait a minute  Order  Order  What a  Order in the studio  You're also  A dope 
[01:37:00]  We  We have court documents  That need to be submitted  No one else  Heard what he just said  Yes  That just proves  That he was late  Your  Your evidence  That you weren't late  Is that parking ticket  Right  Saying that  My car parked  At 5 o'clock  You're supposed to be  In here  At 5 o'clock  You idiot  Take me 10 minutes  To get up here  Where's the parking ticket  It doesn't matter  Where's the parking ticket  We don't say  Be in the parking lot  At 5 o'clock  We say  Holy crap  Bailiff 
[01:37:30]  Oh my god  Bailiff  Oh my god  Let me see the evidence  Oh my god  Eric is right  Eric is right  Because he's supposed to be up here  Working at 5  And according to this  He was in the parking deck  At 5 o'clock  What are you talking about  Eric  That's bad evidence  Eric  That's like OJ  Handing over the knife  Going look  My prints are all over  And I had nothing to do with it  Dude you go get a real job  We don't have real jobs  You're going to have a real job soon  And you  And you  And you tell your  And your boss tells you  You got to be in  At 9 o'clock  And you're in every day  At 9 10  And your excuse is  I was in the parking lot 
[01:38:00]  At 9 o'clock  Are you crazy  You are crazy  This is a minute late  You drink too much water  Over the weekend  A minute late already  Right  From when you step out  Of your vehicle  But that's his proof  That he wasn't late today  That his parking ticket  Was stamped 501  You're supposed to be  In the office at 5  Where do you park sweetie  Downstairs  Downtown  Downstairs  You know what  You have to go through  The stupid security  The fake security guy  Elevators  Go through two or three  Locked doors  I'm just going to go out 
[01:38:30]  On a limb here  I don't think he's  Johnny Hustle either  That's true  That scale would indicate  That you certainly  Weren't power walking  He couldn't wait  To get that ticket  Out of his back pocket  To prove he wasn't  Late today  I could see if they said  He came in at 525  Right  Then I could see  Like him going  Whoa whoa whoa  Mate  No no  A couple minutes  That would make sense  But if someone says  You came in at 510  And you go  No I didn't  Look at this  I was in the basement  At 501  If that is stamped  And then the second  That's stamped  It goes 
[01:39:00]  To 502  Right  Now it's 502  Before you even  You know  Right  Before you talk  To the man  He probably makes  Small talk  The guy's like  How much mail  You eat today  Is that a gallon  Half gallon  They laugh  And by the way  It's no secret  We're not on the first floor here  You have to go  No  Stairs  Yeah  Bunch of floors  Through locked airlocks  It's like  It's like the old  Get smart TV show  You have to go  Through this door  And the other door  Drops out the bottom  It's just a pain in the ass  To get to the office  And he may have had to  Use the facilities  On his way in  He may have stopped  To use the facilities 
[01:39:30]  Did you?  No  IROC?  No  Alright  Go to Kinko's  On the way home  Oh boy  Uh oh  You know what that means  That's a bad sign  That means getting  All your resumes  Printed up  And in order  To be sent out  To Kinko's  Because if you are here  At five  Then you could have  Looked at what  We were going to do today  And go  You know what  I don't really know  If this is going to be  You know something  We can play over here  On the show  I'm going to walk it  Down the hall  And let Al hear it 
[01:40:00]  Before we do it  On the air  Is the disc smashed?  Yeah  Damn it  It was an amazing  I kind of wanted to  I wanted to hear it  Not only did the disc  Disc smash  On the dunking booth window  Yeah  The disc completely shatters  And then the post-it  That was on it  Stuck to the dunking booth  Wow  That's an amazing toss  That's a trick  It was an amazing toss  And I should know  That look who's  In the glass booth here  Just to revel  In Iraq being pummeled 
[01:40:30]  The three stooges  There they are  Danny  Travis  And Sam  How appropriate  Larry Curley  And Mo  Sitting there  Mo  But Iraq  This is a bit of advice  Trust me  I've been late before  I've had to have proof  If you have a parking ticket  And it says 455  And they accuse you  Of being late  You go  No no  Whoa whoa whoa  I was in the parking deck  At 455  What do you think I did  We'd all go  You know what  This kid has proof  Yeah  You never bring in  Timestamp proof  When you're late  You couldn't wait 
[01:41:00]  To get that out of your pocket  To show that it was 501  That you were in the basement  Of this building  That's wonderful  Yeah  It's an odd  It's an odd way  To prove it to you  I did not rape that girl  Just look at her bedsheets  My DNA's all over there  Exactly  All right  Well we know there's one  Bedsheets  How old am I  We know there's one thing  You're really good at  So why don't you do that  Why don't you push that button  It's the O.P.

[01:46:00]  News the other night  Going  I'm going to  Disneyland  Kind of just  Rubbing it in his  Face and everything  How excited  She was  The plays is  Disney World  What effing pig judge  Or pig jury  Gave this  This baby producer  That's all she did  Of course  Who gave her  That much money  Happens all the time  Doesn't matter  What judge it was  All the judges  Are doing this  She hit the field  Right  She was out there  Playing right  She put the gear on  Little known fact

[01:47:30]  And choke the judge  No it gets even worse  Than that  Giant superstar  Michael Strahan  Last night  Angrily tried to  Confront his ex-wife  Who sacked him  For $15 million  In a divorce settlement  It says  A day after  Walking away  With more than  Half of Michael  Strahan's  $23 million  Fortune  So he's worth  $23 million  She gets  $15 of it  Well that's what  The post is saying  Holy mackerel  So now she has  She is worth  More than Michael  Strahan  Even though she  Never played it  Down in the NFL  That just amazes me  That amazes me  That this crap  Is going on 
[01:48:00]  He's kind of stupid  Too though  Because his prenup  Was ridiculous  You bitches  Here's why he lost  Yesterday she said  Strahan had been  Very tender  When she was pregnant  And finally recalled  His gapped front teeth  I love the gap  She said  It was the first thing  That made me fall in love  With him  But she said  He became cold  And unkind  After she gave birth  She also accused him  Of ignoring their daughters  So that's worth  $15 out of $23 million  Yeah  For a living  He tackles other men  How much tenderness 
[01:48:30]  Do you need stupid  You hit the jackpot  And Michael Strahan  As he's outside  The mansion  That he used to own  By the way  And now he's not allowed  To set foot in  He's dropping the kids off  And he yells  If Gene's not here  In five minutes  There's going to be trouble  He has lost his mind  He's going to have  A nervous breakdown  So she gets  $7.5 million  Plus an additional  $1.2 million  In interest  Based on the prenup  So the prenup  Just said  She gets  $7.5 million 
[01:49:00]  That's what the prenup says  When they write up a prenup  It's like  Alright  Things go wrong  I have a lot of money  He probably didn't have  $23 million back then  But he had a lot of money  I give you  $7.5 million  Even that  A lot of money  An additional  $1.2 million  In interest  So that was thrown in  On top of the prenup  And then  A New Jersey judge  Also granted her  Half of the couple's  Joint assets  The prenup  Is the prenup  How does she get 
[01:49:30]  Half his other crap  About $6.6 million  Another  Quarter million  In annual  Child support payouts  As well as their  Least caddy  Escalade  And she can buy  The couple's  $3.6 million  Dreamhouse  From her ex  For $1.4 million  Why?  Because she's a bitch  And he's a guy  That's how it works  I'm more of a fault  The system  And the judge  Because she's just doing  Of course  She's just a greedy pig 
[01:50:00]  Hey  What's she supposed to do?  She hates the guy  Sure  He hates her  She's supposed to sit and go  Well let me be nice  You know what?  It's the system  It sucks  It stinks  You know what?  If anybody  Gets married  You're insane  You're insane  I hear people all the time  Oh you'll do it  People say  You'll do it again  You'll get married  I love my girlfriend  Deeply in love  With my girlfriend  Never getting married 
[01:50:30]  Never  It ain't gonna happen  You gotta be crazy  Look at this  They had a prenup  And she's walking away  With more than half  This is so aggravating  It brings me right back  I'm sitting in that courtroom  Watching myself be raped  Fuck  Under protest  She writes on the back of my checks  That I send her  Under protest  So that later on  When it's all over  And the gravy train runs out 
[01:51:00]  She can pull up and go  Look I signed them all under protest  Which means  I protest them  So I'm entitled to more  Do you really think  She's gonna come back for more  Why would she  Why would she write  Under protest on the back  She's setting the case up already  You're right  If you just cast the checks  For the new listeners  I mean it's kinda obvious  But we do  I was divorced  We do have a bunch of dopes  That need everything  Spilled out for them  Yeah you were married  And you realize  You made a mistake  I wasn't making crap  When I got divorced too  And then they stretched out  The trial  For years 
[01:51:30]  Until I had to sign  A new contract  Where I started making  Some good cash  And they raped me  No kids  They raped me  No kids  No house  No house  Nothing  Nothing  Nothing  And she's making  A damn good living  And my checks  That I have to send  To her every quarter  On the back  Is written  Her name  And under protest  You know why  Because if you just  Cash the check  In some legal way  It looks like you're accepting  This payment 
[01:52:00]  Which by the way  Is completely legal  Court wise  This is what the court says  I pay  Period  And in the whole thing  It says  Nothing else  That's it  Once this is done  It's over  So some a-hole lawyer  Got her ear  And said  Look right under protest  Right under protest  So that way  So you still get the money  But you're  But you know  It opens  It keeps the door open  For a chance  To get more money from him  You cashed him  But it was under protest  You needed the money  To live on  But since you wrote  Under protest 
[01:52:30]  You could go back  And dip into the till  Some more  Well let me tell you  Gravy trains over  I'd sooner go back  To tin knocking  Well  Okay no  The amount of money  That  The amount of money  You have to give up  It's  It's ridiculous  Well let me tell you  These laws have to be  Rewritten  Rewrite them  You rewrite all these  Archaic laws  To keep the women  To get  To boost them up  To get  To get that  Glass ceiling  Out of the way  You make them  Speaker of the effing house  Everyone wants 
[01:53:00]  Their rights  Women  It's the first time ever  We ever bang  Your little gavel  With your limp wrist  You twat  Ah look  Now you made me curse  Damn it  That's right  But she bangs  But she bangs that  That gavel  With a little limp wrist  Yeah  All these women  Want all these rights  But when it comes  To divorce court  Oh  I'm the poor woman  I can't do anything  Give me money  Ugh  You disgust me  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Money hungry  Whores  That's 
[01:53:30]  That's what these  Divorce bitches are  Money hungry whores  And don't try to  Turn it around  Don't give me the  One in a million  Times  Where the woman's  Making more money  And the guy  Finally gets his due  And maybe rapes  You out of your cash  Because 99% of the time  It's the guy  Getting screwed  This stray hand  Settlement  Is a  Travesty  It really is  Discuting  I feel bad  For this guy  But he's  There should be  A bite mark  Taken out of her neck  With a big  Gappy piece of flesh  Left in the middle  Michael  Why would you  Give her 7.5 million 
[01:54:00]  In the prenup  You probably thought  He was going to make  A lot more money  Than that right  Yeah  Probably  Or it comes out  To 20%  I don't know  I don't know  All the details  But it just sounds  Completely just  But the prenup  $214,000 a year  In child support  For two kids  That's  I don't know much  About that  That's not that bad  For an NFL star  To give for his  Whatever  For the kids  You gotta give  The lifestyle  For which  Because the lawyers  Use words like  She needs to live  In the lifestyle  She was used to  Why  How about you go  And live  He gives you enough 
[01:54:30]  To eat  And get a roof  Over your head  And transportation  And you get  An effing job  On your work  How about they  Can have sex  Whenever he wants  There you go  He was accustomed  To getting what he wanted  When he wanted  There you go  Walk in anytime he wants  And just  Zip it  Well that's one of the problems  By the way  He was getting sex  Whenever he wanted  Good for him  Good for him  But still  You should lose  Half your  That's some  $15 million  That is 
[01:55:00]  So expensive  Wow  A lot of people  Calling in  But I want to go  To Keith  Keith from Long Island  Keith what's up  Hey guys  What's going on  Great show  Yeah  We know  I gotta  I gotta tell you  I have  I'm just kidding  Half these people  That are getting divorced  My parents  Everybody I know  One of the main reasons  Why women get divorced  Is because they know  They're gonna leave  With that money  And it's a way out  If they change the rules  I think more people  Might stay together  I'll tell you 
[01:55:30]  Because that's the way  No man  I think you got it all wrong  I mean when we  We go down this road a lot  Because Anne's  Been through it  And a lot of guys  Will call and say  You know what  I stay  I have to stay married  I can't afford to get divorced  They call it  Cheaper to keeper  Yeah  That's what people  Were telling me  When it was like  You know  I'm getting divorced  Dude  Cheaper to keeper  Cheaper to keeper  Oh so I'm supposed  To be miserable  My whole life  So I could  It could be cheaper  For me  And in a way 
[01:56:00]  Michael Strahan  Is kind of lucky  He still has  A bunch of millions  You know  So he'll be  He'll be kind of okay  Alright  But he was only  Supposed to give that  Bitch 7.5 million  I understand  And he has every right  To be outraged  And he should be outraged  I remember when we  Were working at N.E.W.  There was a guy over there  I don't want to give his name out  But he went through a divorce  He was making a really good living  You know  Selling  He was a sales guy  For our radio show  Had a really nice house  North of the city here  In New York  Really nice house  Kids  The whole deal  After his divorce  He could barely afford 
[01:56:30]  A one bedroom apartment  In a bad section of New York  Yeah  And the rest of the money  Even though he was still  Making a good living  Selling advertising  For our show  And other shows  You know  He didn't  He didn't have enough money  He had to pay his wife  The child support  The upkeep on the house  Blah blah blah  The guy was screwed  When it comes to kids  It's different  Like  I don't give her  The end situation  They have no children  How about  None  For maybe a year or two  Somebody gets on their feet 
[01:57:00]  But it's like  She's an adult  She should be working  Like why  Dude  You're telling me anything  You're telling me anything  It's really stickening  Why does that give somebody  The right  To then live off  Of someone else  Not work anymore  Just because you were married  To somebody  Does not give that person  The right  To just write  Like they won lotto  Yeah  They won the lotto  Why should you be connected  To this person  For the rest of your life  Why should I have to be  You decided  You don't want to be  Part of this person's life anymore  Give me a few more years 
[01:57:30]  But does the stupid courts  See it differently  Give me a few more years  If you're a taxing person  No matter if you get divorced or not  Yeah  Yeah  Would you be mad  If you had to  I don't even know what you pay her  Say you had to pay her  Half of what you do have to pay her  For half the time  If that had been the settlement  Let's say you're paying her  Ten bucks a year for ten years  If it had been five bucks a year  For five years  Would you be as mad about it  No  Of course not  But I mean  Not for this financial reason  Would you almost understand  I would  I would  Is it the amount that's getting you  The length of time  Yeah it's the length of time 
[01:58:00]  And the amount  It's the  It's the  Feeling now with the under protesting  Like there's owed more  Like there's shenanigans going on  Where  And if that doesn't remind you  That you did the right thing  By the way  Oh  Just bail out  If that doesn't remind you  Like oh yeah  That's right  I was in hell  I don't know her  I don't care about her  I have nothing  There isn't even  There isn't even feelings  Enough for hatred  There's just  It's  It's a bill  I have to pay 
[01:58:30]  Like Verizon  Like my friggin car payment  And everything else  It's just more  You're a car payment  That's all it is  You're a car payment  You know  You know what it is  On my bank thing  You know I do electronic banking  Yeah  So I have all my bills  Verizon  This one  With that bill  It just says  The Leech  That's the name under it  Which I click on  And  What's your password by the way  Oh  Write it down  It's  Jackass  It's Opie 
[01:59:00]  Oh jeez  I gotta change it now  Jim  Opie dash abs  That's mine  I think I used you  For one of my passwords  I think I did  Ask permission  Let's see  No and by the way  The people that are calling up  I'm not gonna have common law marriage  There is no common law in New York  Stop it  Listen  There was in Massachusetts  And listen  For the ladies listening out there  I get it  You deserve something  But this is so  Right  Sometimes you deserve something  Absolutely  This is so excessive 
[01:59:30]  It's unbelievable  Here's a case  Quickly  If you're a guy  And you hook up with a woman  You get married  She's working her balls off  While you're going to medical school  You go through medical school  You get your practice  She's there  You know  Raising the kids maybe  Doing that or helping you pay for schooling  You become a doctor  You're making the big bucks now  Then I would say  If you get divorced  You do owe her something 
[02:00:00]  A lot  She was the one that enabled you  To go to medical school  You wouldn't have been able to afford it  It would have been a different lifestyle  The whole deal  There was a partnership there  I as I see it  Had no partnership  It wasn't a  I'm not able to do impressions  I can't come on the air  And goof with my friend Opie  Unless she contributed something  You know  For me  That didn't wash  And I thought  That kind of justice  Would come out in the courtroom 
[02:00:30]  Oh my god  But it's a cookie cutter  Get them in  Get them out  They don't care what your name is  What you do for a living  It's all this cookie cutter justice  Where  They just want numbers  Years  Here's which peg  Percentage  Right  Right  And I was being dragged  Into your case  And the stuff they were telling me  I almost wanted to do something crazy  Because they were trying to prove  That she had something to do  With Anthony's success  With us meeting  And I'm like  Oh you've got to be  Kidding me  That was just like 
[02:01:00]  Oh stop it already  Just stop it  Would you be as mad  Let me ask you this  I'm not going to speculate  If it hadn't been like  The way you got in  Let's say she had  Been a fan of Opie's show  You really weren't that familiar with it  And she said  This guy wants  You should go in  And do impressions with this guy  Or if she had introduced you  Or if she had made it  If it was obvious  That she had introduced you  It made it happen  You know something  If there was an inkling  In any way shape or form  I probably would  Even if I didn't  Say it out loud  I would have gone  Eh well  Technically I do have 
[02:01:30]  This interaction  Maybe there's something  It was nothing  Nothing  If anything  My brother should have divorced me  Anthony before you step aside  For a couple minutes here  He'd have been entitled  Yeah  A little word association  Dominic Barber  Oh I'm supposed to just  Blurt something out  Yeah  Fat  Little  In  Bag  Wow really 
[02:02:00]  Yeah  Wow  It was supposed to be  One word  He's a lover of what  Wow  Douchebag  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Call the Opie and Anthony show  Right now  866-313-3  O&A  Who's this?  It's Opie and Anthony  What do you got for the show?  Nothing  So why'd you call? 
[02:02:30]  The Lomy  If you have a point  That's relevant  To the topic at hand  Call the Opie and Anthony  Show  At 866-313-CRIA  866-313-FREE.  Hello.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  We're back, baby.  On this Martin Luther King birthday.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:03:00]  Smooth sound.  We're on the air, brothers.  This one stinks.  Hey, how come we don't have more upbeat stuff?  Yeah, man.  What is this?  This is celebrating his birth, not his death.  Yeah, the black man.  We should have, like, up music.  The black man knew how to groove.  Yeah, it's raining men.  Stuff like that.  What?  Well, it's up.  What?  It's what?  It's upbeat.  It's what?  Raining.  It's gay.  All right, there you go.  Hey, we got a bunch of lawyers on the phones. 
[02:03:30]  We'll talk to them in a second.  Also, we're going to play a quick round of what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today.  Donald Trump's still at it.  This is a quickie.  I just want to get into this.  We had Donald on the show on Friday.  How was he?  Did he say some things about Rosie?  He was great, actually.  Oh, a couple.  He was basically saying how he wants to, like, you know, move on, and then he continued to trash her  and just add a whole bunch of new insults to the pile.  And the New York Post picked up the fact that he was on our show and called out of nowhere.  That was pretty cool.  The post.  We made page six.  That's what we had to do to make page six. 
[02:04:00]  Opie brought up a great question that he answered.  What?  About the wedding.  Yeah.  Actually, I got that one from Lindsey.  That was a good one.  She did the research.  Is that in the story?  Yeah.  That's the only reason we made the post.  All right.  Because we got something different out of him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He actually, he says he didn't, but he invited Rosie to one of his weddings.  His response was great.  I forgot what it was about how, what was it?  Isn't it in the paper?  Yeah.  Can you get it real fast?  We weren't going to go to it today. 
[02:04:30]  But anyway, so Donald Trump still locked in a nasty feud with Rosie O'Donnell.  This is a quickie.  The Donald may be looking at a new target, Secretary of State Rice.  He's just taken on all the broads out there.  There you go.  I was going to say tough targets, but yeah, all the broads.  Donald Trump says in an interview set to air tonight, which was, uh, is that today?  I guess it's Aaron tonight.  Okay.  Aaron tonight that Rice seems like a nice person, but when it comes to her role as the nation's  chief negotiator, he'd like her.  He'd, he'd, oh God, sorry guys. 
[02:05:00]  Too much coffee.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.  All right.  Breathe.  All right.  Donald Trump says in an interview set to air tonight that Rice seems like a nice person,  but when it comes to her role as the nation's chief negotiator, he'd like to use his trademark  line on her.  You're fired.  But the observation is kind of funny.  He's going to be on a Hannity and Combs tonight or Hannity's America or whatever.  So I guess this was last night.  Uh, in all fairness, I see Condoleezza Rice at, uh, Rice.  She goes on a plane.  She gets off a plane. 
[02:05:30]  She waves.  She goes there to meet some dictator.  They talk.  She leaves.  She waves.  The plane takes off.  Nothing happens.  It's a joke.  Nothing ever happens.  I think she's a very nice woman, but I don't want a nice woman.  I want someone that's not necessarily nice.  He wants someone in there that, uh, knows the art of the deal and knows how to negotiate.  I think that's a position that they just kind of give out to, to, wasn't, uh, Madeleine  Albright, secretary of state.  Yeah.  Uh, and then Colin Powell and now Condoleezza Rice.  That, that seems to be a position that they give, uh, to people to show that they're using, 
[02:06:00]  uh, black people or women.  That, that doesn't seem to be a position that has a tremendous amount of get things done.  Not like the old, uh, Hank Kissinger days of Nixon where he was doing, uh, the shuttle  diplomacy and, and, uh, what he was doing really meant something.  Well, I mean, it's only because I think that that's just a place that they'll put somebody  publicly to show you that they're doing something.  But was that just Nixon's way to say, look, I got a Jew.  Very possible.  Very possible.  I just like the observation because that's all you do see on TV as far as she's concerned.  Yeah, she's getting off a plane. 
[02:06:30]  She waves.  She, she sits at that awkward, like, table chair setup that they do with the diplomats.  Like a museum living room it looks like.  It looks like a museum hallway.  They're sitting 15 feet apart with this round table between themselves and they got their  legs crossed.  They're kind of glancing at each other, just nodding.  Oh, yeah.  They're awkward.  Cause you're really going to get work done doing that.  They don't speak the same language.  No.  Uh, real fast.  Here it is.  Just get to foreigners.  No one can say a word to each other.  They're just nodding.  They're nodding.  Yeah.  I would love to know what they're actually thinking in that situation. 
[02:07:00]  He's always saying, I would love to cut that thing off you that gives you so much pleasure.  And she's nodding.  Ah, yes.  I'll be king.  I could smell you from here.  I think they gave me credit for one of your lines, by the way.  This was on, uh, this was in page six of the New York post.  Just give it a rest already.  Donald Trump just won't let go.  The publicity mongering developer surprised XM satellite radio host Opie and Anthony yesterday  morning when he called the show.  Although Trump told them he wants to end his feud with Rosie O'Donnell, he kept slinging  insults at the View star. 
[02:07:30]  Listeners were shocked to learn O'Donnell attended one of Trump's weddings or were even more  startled at Trump's account of his guest.  Asked by Opie to discuss what O'Donnell consumed.  You asked him that, right?  Uh, I said, actually, they cleaned it up.  I said, um, she must have ordered the fish.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  You know, funny.  Got to keep it clean.  Got to keep it clean for the paper.  It's clean.  They serve fish or steak or something at weddings, you know.  That's a great line.  That could have been because she was a whale and she ate seafood. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, no, they changed that.  No kidding.  They're too scared.  So, uh, it ends.  Asked, uh...  Wanted baleen.  Asked by Opie.  Strain through her baleen, the shrimp.  Asked by Opie, but it was actually asked by Anthony, uh, to discuss what O'Donnell consumed.  Trump replied, she ate plenty.  She ate plenty, yeah.  He was, uh, commenting on how much she ate at the wedding.  Good for him.  Yeah.  Let's move backwards a little bit.  Here's Doug from New York.  He's a divorce lawyer.  Doug, what's up?  How are you guys doing?  You're pretty brave to call our show today, Doug. 
[02:08:30]  Hey, Doug.  Hi.  How you doing?  I'm doing fine.  I'm sorry you had such a bad divorce, Anthony.  Ah, they're all bad.  They're all bad.  What are you going to do?  Yes, they are.  Who do you represent usually?  The females or the males?  I usually represent males.  Oh, all right.  Good.  Almost entirely, since, uh, usually, uh, female representatives like to go with women lawyers  and usually can get cheaper counsel.  Yeah, well, when the guy is paying for the counsel, they don't have to get cheaper counsel, 
[02:09:00]  that's for sure.  He has to pay for her.  Yeah, let me pay.  Let me pay for the guy that's going to come in and beat me up.  This is great.  Yeah, how is that fair, by the way?  Yeah.  I had to deal with that as well.  He had to pay for her lawyer.  I had to pay for her lawyer.  He had to pay for her lawyer.  To come in and beat me up.  And all the time that she spent at his office and all that?  Right.  I wanted to ask, um, did you actually go to court and have them separate your assets or  did you do a settlement agreement?  Had to do a settlement.  It was being...  That's what you did wrong.  That's almost everything reason why every guy I've worked with has been cleaned out. 
[02:09:30]  It was being dragged out too long.  And then the stories I'm hearing about, oh, this could go the other way where she really  got...  Those are all lies.  You go to court.  You always go to court.  You have to fight it out to the bitter end.  To the bitter end.  She won't get...  It went on the bitter...  It went on for three years, this divorce.  Three years before I finally had had it.  Well, dude, didn't Michael Strahan just fight it out to the end and lose?  Yeah, did you have... 
[02:10:00]  He probably...  Every time you hear in the news, usually about these big, big agreements, it's almost always...  No, this said the judge...  The judge...  This was the judge's verdict.  As long as Strahan doesn't go insane and appeals the verdict, he will have a change.  No, he's going to go insane and kill the bitch.  Did you see the front page of the paper today?  This guy's out of his mind.  That's the problem.  If he calms down, doesn't do anything too stupid, he can appeal for a change of the  decision since the trial judge...  What state was that in, anyway? 
[02:10:30]  Jersey.  Jersey.  Oh, God, Jersey.  Yeah.  He's going to fight it, obviously, but, you know...  In this clip, they...  He'll bring it down.  This picture they have of him on the cover of the Post.  Looks like he's screaming, but the way the papers do it, he's probably singing karaoke  somewhere.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  With his mouth wide open.  It's probably a fun moment.  All right, Doug, we've got to cut you short, because we're running out of time on this  side of the show.  Thanks for letting me talk.  Have a good one.  Yeah, that's okay.  Bill us for your time.  Yeah.  Looks like the last king of Scotland's shouting.  Let's go to Jim in North...  Not North.  It's New Hampshire. 
[02:11:00]  Jim, what's up?  Hey, I can only speak for a minute.  I'm just about to get into work, but I am a doctor, and my wife did not book me through medical  school.  I worked while I was in medical school.  So, I paid her bills, and she ended up spending a lot of time with a buddy of mine a few years  ago.  Of course, she got, you know, I loved it to death.  She got the house.  She got my son.  And after I paid my medical school loans, I'm left with taking home about $2,000 a month.  Wow.  You're a doctor.  A doctor.  A doctor.  Making $2,000 a month because of what he has to deal with with the divorce settlement. 
[02:11:30]  And his wife was cheating on him with his friend.  Hey, dude, can you mail her an AIDS needle and then say, fun gift inside?  And she'll jam her hand in the bag.  Thanks, man.  All right, Jim.  Oh, he's gone.  I guess he really did have to go into work.  Busy man.  It's obvious.  I mean, we talk about this from time to time.  The guys get screwed in these divorce cases.  And nothing's changing.  The women want all these rights and everything, which is fine and dandy, but you got to take  the bad with the good there, gals. 
[02:12:00]  You want to break through that glass ceiling?  That's one thing.  But how about in the courtroom during divorce?  Why don't you come across as that strong, powerful woman that could take care of herself?  Yeah, why don't you use the same behavior in court that you use when you're going from  promotion to work?  Yeah.  The same, I don't need a, I'm capable, I'm as equal.  Where's that attitude?  Yep.  All right, kids.  Silly geese.  Yeah.  We love yous.  I, Opie.  I, Anthony.  I, Jimmy.  The iShow.  The iShow.  And who are these two?  Continues on IXM next. 
[02:12:30]  Right.  Oh, Patrick.  Hi.  Patrick Duffy begins today.  Hello, mustache.  All right.  You puke face.  Take a nice look over there.  You might be sitting there soon.  Oh, look at I Rock's face.  Oh, poor I Rock.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have yourself a great day.  Bye.  Opie and Anthony, XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:13:00]  Here we are.  That's right.  Oh, wow.  On the streets of New York City.  It's raining.  It's, we're talking.  My hands are cold.  It's really foggy.  It's chilly and damp.  Tomorrow's going to be a lot colder.  I'm holding an iced latte.  Why?  What is the forecast for tomorrow, Opie?  You can't just say a lot colder.  Well, it's going to get down to the 30s.  Oh, she ain't going to make it.  We're finally going to have, like, normal temperatures for January in New York City.  Why is my mic crappy still today?  It is.  Jesus, this guy's.  Not anymore. 
[02:13:30]  This guy's dressed for fucking Venice Beach.  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  New homeless guy.  How are you doing there, fella?  You all right, sir?  How are you doing, sir?  How are you doing?  You all right?  I used a few million dollars.  Yeah, who could?  I love this guy already.  I like you guys.  Wait, talk to us.  We don't bite.  How are you doing, man?  We don't bite.  And we might have a few bucks.  We always like it.  Oh, that's why you're homeless.  You don't see an opportunity when it's staring you in the face.  Homeless guys are crazy.  You know, that's these homeless advocates.  When they come out and say, it's, you know, families that have, anything could, anyone 
[02:14:00]  could become homeless because you lost your job or this.  Everyone we've met, every single one is a fucking lunatic.  Then again.  Yeah.  Let me play devil's advocate.  All right, devil.  The last group of.  Ow, the pitchfork up my ass.  Be so literal.  You took a lot, though.  The last.  The last.  Diesel Washington would be proud.  Yeah, there you go.  I knew Idol.  The fucking, the last group of men that approached him probably weren't giving him money.  They're probably setting him on fire and shitting into his mouth and yelling, hey, bum, eat 
[02:14:30]  this.  Gotta take the bad with the good when you're homeless.  Speaking of the homeless, a quick story.  Yes.  I took the Long Island Railroad home to go to the Islander game on Saturday.  Yeah.  And you know how we talk about, like, when you're up in that studio, anything pretty  much goes, but on the street it's a little different.  Right.  Well, I'm walking to the Long Island Railroad, and you know, they got the homeless people  out with the big, the big jug or whatever, and they want your change.  They're like, change for the homeless, change for the homeless. 
[02:15:00]  It's all over New York City, everywhere you go, right?  She goes, change for the homeless.  I go, no, I hate the homeless.  And I realize I'm not on the radio.  She looks at me, and she goes, that's so mean.  And I'm like, well, I was just trying to give you an answer that you haven't heard before.  Mean but true.  And then I'm walking away, like, all proud of what I did and said, and then all of a  sudden it got to me, and I walked back, and I got 10.  Hi!  Hi, ladies!  Hello!  Where are you from?  Girls with dollies! 
[02:15:30]  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  Just yell it out.  New Jersey?  New Jersey, okay.  American what?  American girls.  No, it's American.  American girls store.  Yeah, it's a.  Oh, American girls doll.  It's a.  Oh.  It's a big thing.  That's adorable.  No.  Are you needing a few extra bucks?  Let's be creepy.  Nice.  It's the latest thing with those little girls.  They get their own special doll, and you go to this store, and you can get your doll's  hair done, and get outfits, and little things for it.  Isn't that funny?  It's way past the Barbie thing. 
[02:16:00]  We just passed the guy that had cardboard for socks.  This city.  Yeah.  It's so diverse.  What does this get your doll?  How about this?  Here's your Barbie.  Change your boots, or I'll kick in the cunt.  Merry Christmas.  What?  What?  Oh.  She got really mad at that.  That was very rude, Opie.  It was very rude.  I'm sorry.  How great was she?  That's a new bit right there.  That face was really good.  They have no idea what we did, but that's a new bit. 
[02:16:30]  That's so mad.  There was some chick on a cell phone, and I just.  Put his microphone by her.  Right in her face.  Shoot it away.  Disgusted.  That look she gave you.  Wow.  I like that bit.  Yeah.  Hi, sir.  Why?  Good morning.  That'll change.  How are you?  Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  The gentleman.  Jimmy doesn't.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know.  No.  What are you doing?  It's closing. 
[02:17:00]  Lunatic.  I hope he like shoved his hand in the elevator.  Do you see how you can close on your arm, though?  Yes.  Very dangerous.  Make sure that this is pushed.  The danger of elevators.  We'll be talking about that at 10.  Did you break it?  No.  Don't be broke.  Yes.  Oh, just shut.  It's fine.  Okay.  Steve's at 2,000 years old.  You never stick your arm in an elevator door.  Never?  No.  Sometimes.  Or in the mouth of a tiger.  You use your cock.  What?  I said you sometimes do. 
[02:17:30]  I didn't hear you.  Great.  There we are.  Oh, it's open.  All right.  Going into the elevator.  We'll see you upstairs.  Obi and Anthony.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  We'll see you upstairs.  We'll see you upstairs.  We'll see you upstairs.  We'll see you upstairs.  We'll see you upstairs.  We'll see you upstairs.  We'll see you upstairs.

[02:20:00]  Thank you. 
[02:20:30]  Thank you. 
[02:21:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[02:21:30]  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of panel all PM.  What?  Opie.  I am a...  A...  Opie.  You know I can have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver 
[02:22:00]  Let's get the show on the road  And go, yes  It's the Opie and Anthony show  The second half of the Opie and Anthony show  And dummy of the day goes to  Someone from their cell phone on instant feedback  He simply writes  Hank Kissinger  Must have been his brother, Ant  Oh, because he's assuming  I got Hank Kissinger  Mixed up with Henry Kissinger 
[02:22:30]  Who is the Secretary of State  For Nixon  And by calling him Hank  I made a mistake  You just know him a little better than most people  You're allowed to call him Hank  Right, I was using the  Hank equals Henry  Henry and Hank are the same thing  Hank is like a nickname for Henry  Douchebag  What's his name, by the way?  Who?  Did he leave a name?  Of course he didn't  Why would he?  Well, it's on his mobile device  His phone number is  9-1 
[02:23:00]  You're lucky  If you're like feedbacking from the cell phones  Which we're seeing more and more of  That's really cool  But give your name somewhere in the instant feedback  So he can make funny and beat you up  Oh, someone's commenting  Hank Kissinger works for Dick Nixon  Oh, there you go  See, it's like four different people there  Did anyone download the Luminous 2 song from Friday?  Oh boy, that debacle  What are you talking about? 
[02:23:30]  It's a song from a video game that Opie's liking  And thought it was cool and would be cool to play  That Opie played probably  How many hours in a weekend?  Hold on, I'm going to say  Saturday, Sunday's 48  Plus some of Friday  Some of Friday when you get home  We get home pretty early Friday  I'm going to say 66 hours  It's safe to say I played for 8 hours yesterday  Safe  Oh, okay  And probably, because I went to an Islander game on Saturday  Probably 5 to 6 on Saturday 
[02:24:00]  That's a lot  To the point, I was thinking about you, Anthony  Because I had the dry eyes  Yep  The bloodshot eyes  The computer  Holy shit, I think I've lost my eyesight eyes  PSP screen hangover  Yeah, and then you get the headaches  And then you feel dehydrated  Like, what is wrong with me?  It's like, oh yeah  I played this game way too long  And it's on a little PSP  So you have to kind of like  Squint a little bit to get everything in  I got a pretty big monitor  And I play a lot of first person shooters  Right now I'm playing third person 
[02:24:30]  Splinter Cell  And there are times I'll get off of it  I've been looking at it for so many hours  That I feel like I'm on a boat  Yeah, okay  Like, I've concentrated on the movement so much  And you get a little queasy, right?  That it's not like  Yeah, you're normal, like, everyday crap  Yeah, you turn your head  And it's like, whoa  Yeah  You kind of, oof  You get a little  Everything slowly follows you  You've been fixated on one little dot on the screen  Where you're firing from  And kind of looking around  As the screen's moving 
[02:25:00]  With first person  Fucks your eyes up  What is Luminous?  Luminous 2 is like  Take off on kind of like Tetris  But it's with blocks or squares  And each square has like  Color combinations  Two color combinations  Or it can be a solid color combination  And then those two colors  Are in different forms on each block  And then they fall from the sky  And then you've got to match up the colors  From each individual block  To make complete squares  And then they disappear  Oh my god  Oh my god  I can play that for ten minutes  And I would throw the thing  I would bash my head in with it 
[02:25:30]  It is made for someone like me  That has OCD  Crack  Holy mother of god  At least track of time  Over and over again  Were you on a plane playing that  And we were flying  Over and over and over again  And I'm looking at him  And I'm like  What is he playing?  That's why  And I know this is  I know this is my problem  I do have OCD  Not  Everyone has OCD by the way  Because I've  I've studied this  But most people keep it under control  My problem is like video games  Like that's why 
[02:26:00]  I don't get into like  EverQuest and things like that  Because I would be one of those guys  That would turn into a shut-in  I would turn into a shut-in  Trying to level up  I know that  At least with like this Luminous 2  There's an end  There's an end in sight  The end for me is  I gotta hit 100,000  Because how they have Luminous 2 set up  There's a scoreboard or whatever  And the top position is 100,000  Which the computer has  So the whole thing for me  Is to beat the computer  So I have to get over 100,000  Then I'll be able to finally put the game down  And I'm up to like  I've gotten as high as like 79,000 
[02:26:30]  After many, many, many, many hours  Of playing this game  So what will happen when you get over 100,000?  Then I'll have no problem putting the game down  But why?  Just because it's done  I beat it  There'll be no more interest in it to me  None  That's been his goal  Like I played Tiger Woods on PSP  I had to like  I had to go all the way to the end  And become Tiger Woods  And that was a nightmare  That took fucking months  Wow  Man  You sure don't look anything like him  What happened? 
[02:27:00]  You sure don't golf like him?  But that's why I don't get involved with these online games  Like these  Like EverQuest  World of Warcraft  Thank you  All those  Because those  EQ2  Star Wars Galaxies  I'm scared of those games  I'm not going to lie to you  I'm scared of them  Because it's in my mindset  That I would  I would just  I would get caught up in the game  That is made for you  To capture you  Because it is  Right  So based on  I gotta level up  One more level  I'm not going to sleep  Until I hit this level 
[02:27:30]  But that's why  I don't even like  Read up on those games  I just make believe  They don't exist  Because I know  That would be a problem with me  Graphics  You get a great system  My brother Elmo  You can't even talk me into it  Because I've already figured it out  In my mind  Just don't even go there  It's one of those  Don't even go there  That's why when  O-board is a computer  It's like  Alright  What kind of video card  Are you getting?  The basic  Yeah  Because I don't need anything  It helps me order my computers  And yeah  I keep that in mind  I'm like no  And I'm like dude 
[02:28:00]  There's a card though  That I mean  It can make any game  Look like  No  Don't even want to know  Like my brother  I don't even want my email  To look good  I want it to look like  An Atari  And I see this crap  Because my brother Elmo  Who we all know  And love on the show  His roommate  Is one of these guys  He has no life  Yeah  His life is  Playing video games  Like I mean  12 hours a day minimum  Minimum  Really?  Minimum  He's online  12 hours a day  The games change 
[02:28:30]  He was into Tribes  I guess  Tribes was the big one  He was into  And a few others  He's probably World of Warcraft now  I don't even know  I go to my brother's house  You know a lot  When I'm in Huntington  Never see the dude  That's the game du jour  And he's there  In his room  Door closed  Headphones on  Perfect video  Gaming system  What a fork  I'll be there  In the middle of the summer  When it's just  Unbelievable out  And you just want to be outside  And he's in his room  Shades down  So you can see the computer  Even better  Just  Playing around the clock  He goes to work  Just to pay his bills  That is it 
[02:29:00]  And if he ever does  If he ever does  This is happening  Like crazy though  And if he does  Decide to socialize  What he does  Is he  Takes his computer  And goes somewhere else  To play the game  I'll tell you something  With other people in the room  The number of people  That are spending  That much time  On these games  Is dropping off  Is it really?  Yeah  The games  Themselves  Like I'm waiting  For the next  Really good one  They get a little  Redundant  It takes years  But you kind of  Get like  Alright  I want to get  To the next level  But once I do 
[02:29:30]  It's kind of like  When I got to  The next level  Before  You go on raids  And stuff  You do pretty much  Everything you can do  Like there was a point  I was at my peak  With these games  It was EverQuest  I was what they call  Three boxing  It's using three  I had three separate accounts  That I was paying for  And three computers set up  And I was working  Three different characters  As my own team  And I would go in  And  Yeah exactly 
[02:30:00]  And not only that  Twelve  Fifteen hours at a clip  Just sitting there  Running three characters  Where you should  You know  Normally only people  Run one  You know  I was thinking about  This over Christmas though  Because I went to  A few people's houses  Where they have  You know  They were getting  New games for Christmas  Whatever  And I think you're right  I think people are  Looking for the  Quick fix games again  Yeah looking for  Like when we grew up  There was an end  To all these games  And most of them  No more than  Ten minutes you're done  Fifteen minutes you're done  Yeah 
[02:30:30]  But you were satisfied  By the results in a way  Yeah  You guys played that  Guitar Hero game  That ridiculous game  I don't like anything  With silly controllers  They were playing that  Like I think it's called  Guitar Hero  Or something like that  They were playing that game  To death  They couldn't get enough of it  And it's the most simplest  Stupidest thing  Where you're just trying  To hit the same notes  On this fake guitar  As the song  That's playing on TV  They're looking for  The simple ones  Point and shoot  And they even tell you  What color  Well red will hit this note  Yellow will hit this  Red yellow will hit this note  You know  Whammy bar  And they weren't interested 
[02:31:00]  In playing like Grand Theft Auto  All the way to the end  And stuff like that  Like massive multiplayer  Online games  You know  Where you get  Thousands of people  That are logged on  It's a community of people  That thing is kind of  Except for World of Warcraft  Which hasn't caught on  As much as EverQuest did  In it's prime  People aren't really  Going for that anymore  Yeah I really don't think so  They need changing  Because most of those games  Were just take offs 
[02:31:30]  On the last one  Like you got sick of EverQuest  So you went to EverQuest 2  So even though  You got sick of that  You went to WoW  I get what you're saying  Even though the names  Of the games have changed  It's the same type of gameplay  So you're like  I'm level 1  I'm beating this fucking animal  With a stick  Long enough to become level 2  Where I'll beat  A little bit of a better animal  With a little bit of a bigger stick  Till I get a sword  And then I'm level 5  So it's kind of the same thing  So like I'm waiting for the next  I loved those games 
[02:32:00]  They're really like immersive  But you're waiting for the next twist  Waiting for the next little twist on it  Yeah  Something  A good twist was Star Wars Galaxies  It offered like a whole different way  Of creating your character  Where you weren't like a cookie cutter character  But then they changed that  And dumbed that fucking thing down  Where you can't play it anymore  Now I'm just playing like  First person shooters  Or like I said  Now Splinter Cell  The latest Splinter Cell  Is the one I'm playing  Nice sniper rifle  Choking them  Snapping necks  See you guys 
[02:32:30]  You especially get into these heavy things  My only experience  With any type of  I was addicted to Asteroids for years  But the arcade game  But when me and Bill D'Angelo  Used to play Intellivision  There was a racing game  I was there man  There was a racing game  Very basic  Where you drive through the country  On the Intellivision  With the awful controllers  But me and Bill learned  That if you went off the road  You could drive through  Like grass and stuff  And you never knew  Where you were going to wind up  And there was like 
[02:33:00]  A really weird like  Sense of adventure  Like even though it was a shit game  It was like  Oh my god  I'm going off the beaten path  And like  I can understand  If that did that to me  Within Intellivision  Dude  These must be like  500 times  Let me tell you something  The first time  I got into playing EverQuest  And there were a lot of people  That did this  The graphics weren't as good  As they are now  But it was that  Unknown thing  You went into these zones  That were giant  Unprecedented in gaming  And you didn't know 
[02:33:30]  Where or what  Was going to jump out at you  And kick your ass  And it wasn't like it is now  You died  It was a pain in the fucking ass  To get your body  And your shit back  Like everything you'd worked for  For months at that point  Let's say  Right  Was laying there  On your body  You all of a sudden  Got transported back  To your  The point where  You lock yourself in  And start  A spawn point  Yeah  And have to run back  Without knowing  Where the fuck you died 
[02:34:00]  All of a sudden  You could be walking  And boom  Noel hit you  For fucking 350  And you had like 200  You're just dead  So you're going back  To the place you died  You go back to this place  Hoping you can get  All your shit back  You have no clothes on  No weapon  Now you have to go back  Into this treacherous area  Locate your body  Lay in there  And pilfer all the shit  Back off of it  To be like  Back into the position  Where maybe you can  Defend yourself  Yeah as far as gaming goes  There was a  There's a lot more  To lose and at risk  Yeah and there was 
[02:34:30]  A lot of adventure to it  Like you'd walk and go  What the fuck is that  Like you'd be just  Walking through a field  And then big fucking castle  And you're like  I have no idea  What's in there  If it could kill me  If maybe I could level up  Real quick on it  So you're kind of creeping around  And it was real like  Immersive  It was very immersive  And that kind of whole thing  Is gone now  They've dumbed down  A lot of these games  They've put out  Too much information  They've made it too easy  Where now when you die  You really have nothing at risk  You get your shit back 
[02:35:00]  You fucking  Well that's just to get  More people to play  You could port around  Where you used to have to run  And sometimes it would take  A long time  To run from point A  To point B  You'd have to get a druid  To port you somewhere  And pay him money  So to become a druid  Was a big thing  Now  You just go to these ports  And instantly get ported  Like they dumbed it down  And really kind of  Fucked the game up  Like I said  I'll say it again  That's just to get  More people to play  But it kind of hurt the game  Yeah  Someone is saying that  It's guitar hero  You can't  It's guitar hero  It's guitar hero 
[02:35:30]  It's guitar hero 2  That dumb game  I was talking about  I want to transport people  Let's say hi to Brian  In New York  Brian what's up  Brian  Yeah what's up fellas  Hey  That guitar hero game  Always at Walmart  I go in the shop  And there's 12  13 year old kids  Playing that game  I always want to  Always wanted to play  And my wife always  Catches me staring at it  So one night  3 o'clock in the morning  I go to Walmart  Just so I could play  Guitar hero  I'm a 30 year old man  I felt like a damn jackass  Fuck this 
[02:36:00]  Well Brian  She's probably mad at you  Because she thinks  You're staring at the  12 year olds playing it  You're standing there  Just creepily looking at these boys  Playing a fucking guitar  Fucking pedophile  Stop it  Well the point I was making  And then we went off  On a little tangent there  I was talking about Luminous 2  And the cool thing  About Luminous 2  Is they got a lot of  Really cool songs  On this game  That are just cranking out  As you're trying to do  This like Tetris like game  And then they have like  Then the video  There's a video  In the background  You know the blocks  Are falling  In front of this video  It's gotta be distracting 
[02:36:30]  Beyond distracting  But the music  Some of the songs rock  And there's like  Just freaking colors  It's like you're tripping  Who does the songs  Like what  Everybody from Beck  To  Oh so it's popular artists  It's not just like  Black Eyed Peas  Have a song  I don't have the list  In front of me  But there's one song  I was grooving to  It's called  Stroll Around the World  So we talked about that  On Friday  And we don't have it  In the master computer  At XM  Which surprised me  Bill's shaking his head  Instantly going  No don't ask me about it  We don't have it  I won't fuck up 
[02:37:00]  Like I did on Friday  And here's  I won't fuck up  On Friday  Oh it was hysterical  Oh my god  OPS for the song  Bill played something  That I can only imagine  Two men sucking  Each other's cocks to  Well because I said  It was from Luminous 2  Happy birthday  I said it was from  Luminous 2  So he  He decided the band  Was called  Luminous 2  And E-Rock or somebody  Had a file of songs  From the Luminous game  That I  The first one  That I played 
[02:37:30]  Yeah  So he played  One of the  Buttery beats  That we used to talk about  Right  The new game  They don't do  Buttery beats  It's all like  You know  In your face music  A lot louder  You know  A lot hipper  Whatever  So I talked about  This song  We didn't have it  In the computer  So stupid me  You know  We have so many people  Working for the show  I assume one person  Would fucking go get it  Stupid  Did anyone get it  No the one place  We can find it  Is the Japanese  iTunes store  And we can't buy  Stuff off  Of the Japanese  This song has to be

[02:44:30]  In the desert  To cities all over the country  This hot dog is wet  And it smells like tuna fish  Oh gross  I don't think  I don't think this captures 
[02:45:00]  The spirit of MLK  I don't think  He would have really  Dug on that  Hey man  What do we know  We're trying to do our best  Here today  Hey we showed up  That's right  A lot of other people  Didn't  That's right  A lot of people asking  How much does E-Rock weigh today  There's a little confusion  We're weighing him Thursday  Well he gets weighed weekly  Yeah  We want to go with  A weekly weighing  I know we said Monday at first  And we changed it quickly 
[02:45:30]  And said  Let's give it a week  Yeah  Give it a week  So there's no way  To test progress along the way  To see if he's putting me on  Maybe to knock him in  To shock his system a little bit  We kind of asked him  If he felt he was losing weight  And he said yes  Well some  You know what  If you see it  What was he  219  He's still 219  That's a healthy weight  For a boy his height  We weighed him last Thursday  After we told him  You should lose weight  You want to give him  You want to give him  A surprise weighing real quick  I think he can help 
[02:46:00]  Just to see if he's making  Any headway  Yeah  It can help  Alright  I know we were supposed  To wait a week  But this could really  Put the pressure on him  Or it could take the pressure off  And if the pressure is off him  He might decide  Hey  I could eat a little bit more  Poor guys turned around  And I yelled at  By the way  If he gained  Or stayed the same  He has to  He has to do chubby bunny again  A-Rock  You know we were supposed  To weigh you on Thursday  You have a week  Yep  You were 219  We've decided 
[02:46:30]  Perhaps we need  A little  A little pop quiz  Intermediate  Yeah  A pop quiz  A little pop quiz  We weighing  We want to know  What your progress is  This won't count  Toward your final  You know goal  Or anything like that  But it'll give you  A little  I don't know  We want to see  Where your head's at  Yeah  It'll give you  A little thing  That way if you're  Losing some weight  You'll get a little incentive  If you gain some weight  You'll be like  Boy I better work  A little harder  And if you're the same  You should say 
[02:47:00]  The same thing  You know  Work a little harder  Here's why you're  Being weighed  Because the bosses  Want it done  This is like  This is now  Like the Borgata girls  The Borgata babes  The Borgata babes  We want bodies  Like Nathaniel  And Sam  And Travis  And Bill  That's what we want  Working in this  Homorotic environment  Bulimics and anorexics  That's right  And just raceless oddballs  With fucking accents  That are 400 miles off  But rosy cheeks 
[02:47:30]  That any grandma  Would love to pinch  He is as  Apply cheeked a boy  As you're gonna find anywhere  That's in a singles ad  Lonely  Apply cheeked boy  Seeks woman  For long walks  In the park  And racial discussions  As to why I'm white  And talking like Steve  Through this stupid  Little improv pitch  He looks  He looks thinner  He lost a pound  Do you think?  I bet he's 216  Nah he lost some weight  That's my thing  You can tell  I don't know 
[02:48:00]  He's got the confidence  Of a man  He's wearing stripes  Let me see  He's wearing stripes sideways  That usually makes you  Look fatter  And I'm not feeling  That he's fat right now  Yeah but he's wearing  A double XL  I'm looking at his neck  And I'm seeing  It might be an illusion  But a little less  Yeah he lost weight  Do you think he lost weight?  Yeah absolutely  I'll say  I have no doubt in my mind  217  I guess 216  Let me compromise  You say tomato  I'll say tomato  Let's pull the whole thing off  I'll go with 218 
[02:48:30]  So they're all covered  I'll say 217  I say 222  I think fucking nervous Nelly  Has eaten more this week  He thinks that's gonna help him  He's only eating bread and rolls  Alright let's go  Up on the scale there  IROC  Get on there  Hope you're wearing nice heavy shoes too  The weight to beat is 219  Go ahead Eric  216  216  216.5

[02:49:30]  Who the hell is this guy again?  He's fucking  He's my new favorite guy  And he'll soon to be yours  They met him at the Porn Award  The ABN Expo  Out there in Vegas  All the porn stars  And one guy  Diesel Washington  Giant black man  Who uh  It would be any white man's  Nightmare in prison  In prison  This guy  It would be your nightmare  At Starbucks  Anywhere  Anywhere  Anywhere  Uh the guy apparently likes  Uh uh  Fucking guy's asses  Fisting them 
[02:50:00]  He's as brutal as they can  And here's the thing  That was really  That's unsettling about him  Is we met him  We were interviewing  The very swishy gay guy  Who was kind of fun  To chit chat with  Steve  No no  Oh  Steve was trying to be shy  I don't know what you're talking about  Correcting the guy on terminology  Uh  And then Diesel  Kind of waved at me  I think he's  From Lucky Lou  Or whatever  He goes you know  I like your stuff  Or whatever  He was  But he's like  A big regular dude  I knew he was a gay guy  Because I have  I saw him with his arms  Around other men 
[02:50:30]  Right  But to hear him talk about  How he's gonna  We of course wanted to talk about  How he might fuck Steve  And to hear him discuss this  Oh my god  He doesn't sound like a gay dude  He's like a guy telling you  How he's gonna spank and fist you  And it's unsettling  Oh of course it is  He's not hearing it like  And then  Yeah  Cause that's kind of  Oh what I would do to you  Yeah  Oh really  Yeah this guy's giving you facts  Just facts  Like a man would talk about machinery 
[02:51:00]  And he's what  Like 6'4  He's a big kid man  Big boy  Big kid  And he's in fucking  The reason I got a picture of him  Is because  I watched him  Him and a bunch of other shirtless guys  I got a picture from the back  Where he's got his arm around them  But a second before  He had been grabbing their asses  Like the way I would grab  Fucking  Like a small girl's ass  Like a  You know  A fucking nice little fucking  Not little girl  Small chick  He was just groping these guys asses  I'm like  That's gonna be the greatest photo  I've ever  But I missed it  Cause he moved his arms up  Did I show you the pic I had  You missed the sexy  I saw the 
[02:51:30]  I saw the photo of him  Just looking straight at the camera  But look at the  Just  Look at the  This guy's a fucking  Major problem  I'm all about these  And we got this audio for tomorrow  Hopefully  We're cutting it up for tomorrow  We'll do the whole  Recap of the porn convention tomorrow  Yeah  With Steve and Jimmy  Look at the size of that fucking  Look at the fucking  Size of that kid from the back  He's a monster  He's a big dude  He's a beast  He's got like muscles  On top of muscle  Yeah  He's a fucking problem  Fuck  He might be able to give Kenny a good rate  I say we test it out 
[02:52:00]  Wow  Ouch  Ouch  Ouch  You know I didn't ask for this  I didn't even get an AIDS test yet  Look  Alright  We got a  We got a preview of this song from Luminous 2  Oh  A preview?  An iTunes preview right?  How did that get found?  Cause you get 30 seconds  You get 30 seconds  Oh  Why didn't you just buy it?  Does anyone have an iTunes account here?  You can't use your American iTunes account  What? 
[02:52:30]  You can't use your American iTunes account  For Japanese  Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  You're speaking Japanese  What are you doing?  Little soft spoken  You got all embarrassed  Gentile red cheeked angel  Blah blah blah blah  Wow  You can't use  There's a Japanese version of iTunes  That is incompatible  Why?  You sign on with your American account  And they just say  You can't buy anything here  Cause we're taking it back  Yeah  Boy they won't let you just  Can you start  How about this?  Here's a question 
[02:53:00]  Can you start an account with a Japanese  Under a different name?  You got some yen in your bank account?  No no  But can you use American money  To pay for your Japanese account?  Not that I know of  Don't yell at me  Alright  Before we play Star Casino  Stroll around the world  Speaking of faggots  Oh  Hey  Speaking of faggots  We got Cary on the phone  He was  Voted off The Apprentice  Last night  Alright  Cary  Hola  Como esta? 
[02:53:30]  Uh  Bien  So bien  Gracias  So that's an interesting  Way to bring on somebody  Faggot  It's a great word  I love that  Yeah  It's only in the loving way  Sir  Well as a faggot  Do you like the name faggot?  Or the term faggot?  Cause we've been having a discussion  On our show about that  About derogatory terms  And  You know  Some people get  Offended by the word faggot  And we say no  Cause they use it themselves  And it should be fine 
[02:54:00]  In a weird way  It's almost like a queer eye  For the straight guy  Where it's like  If straight guys say it's bad  But like  Then a bunch of gay guys  Name a show after that  I like girls  Where it's just  Hey girls  Right  You know what I call  My friends girls  Like that old gag  What do you call  A gay  Black gentleman  If you call him  By his name  Whatever that may be  Exactly  Right  So no  I think  I would say to you  That I think that  Faggot is a little  Inappropriate  To refer to someone 
[02:54:30]  Unless you happen  To be their friend  For many of years  If not  Then you would probably  Just want to call them  Their names  Yeah  I don't think  Well is the F word  Like the N word  Terry  It is a little bit  You know  And definitely  I don't even use it  To refer to other  Gay people  But it's a little  Inappropriate  But are you guys  Allowed to use it  Amongst yourselves  And that's cool  But if like a straight guy  Says it then  Then you're going to  Have to throw down  Right 
[02:55:00]  No I think it's  Throw down either way  Because it's  You know  Yeah that's not really  That's not really  A gay word  Where gay gentlemen  Will call each other  That  Yeah no  Are you familiar  With Diesel Washington  By the way  Mr. Torrance  Got the answer  To the question  Diesel Washington  No  I'm unfamiliar  He's a male adult  Porn star  He does films  With other gentlemen  And we've been  Discussing him this morning  Well you don't know  Who this guy is  Is there Kerry  Diesel  No  Why would I 
[02:55:30]  Because I know  Like most regular  I say right  Most straight porn stars  I'm at least aware  Of a lot of them  So I thought he might be popular  He's like a big  Dominant gentleman  He's not  Completely hilarious  I love this  You're talking to a businessman  So what is a human being  Right I know  Yeah but  People watch porn  By the way  When you say  That you're loving this  That means you're really not  Let's be honest  With each other  Well I mean  We got off  On the wrong foot here  The notion that I would know  Who a porn star is  I have no idea 
[02:56:00]  Actually that's not a bad question  That's not a bad question  Because I don't  I don't watch a lot of porn  But I know the porn stars  And Diesel is a guy I met  Last weekend  This weekend  He's a gay porn star  And he's apparently  Pretty popular  And like I know  A lot of  Even like straight porn  That I don't watch  I still know  Who a lot of the names are  Like I know the names  I mean you know  I love porn  No well  I will say to you  That I don't know  Any porn stars  Besides Ron Jeremy  And that was only because  I was once at a party  That he was at 
[02:56:30]  And someone pointed him out  So I have no idea  Who  Yeah everyone knows  Who Ron Jeremy is  Yeah  What was Ron doing  Was he dragging his dick  Through the buffet  No  Ron's the Babe Ruth of porn  Everyone knows him  Yeah he's thinking of  With some very beautiful women  And I have yet to see him  I guess  Inaction  In his work  Of sorts  But yeah  No he was just bad  I just met him  He's a very nice guy  So you got kicked off  The Apprentice huh  Yeah yeah yeah  There comes a time  In every man's life  Where you should be fired 
[02:57:00]  For something  And that opportunity  Came last night  That's how you're spinning it  Now that  I see the challenge  Was a bathing suit line  Right  Correct  It was  For Trina Turk  And  And the men's line  I think you kind of went  A little bit  In the wrong direction there  Did you feel that  The unbuttonable  Back part  Was what made  Most men uncomfortable  You know  Here's the thing  I'll say this  That out of all the suits 
[02:57:30]  That I designed  All of them  By the way  There were  I think we had like  Six looks  And I designed  Probably five of them  Yeah  Even the women's  So even the  You know  The men board short  That we had  Like it's so funny  People focus on one suit  It's like the one  Pink suit that we had  Is the one  That everyone focused on  Well of course  Yeah  So it's one of the things  That it gets a bad rap  Because I think  That people think  It's too small  But if you know  Anything about  Basically what you're saying  Is you're a size queen  So you want 
[02:58:00]  No  No  No he's just saying  There was a variety  But they focused on that  That it was too small  Pink floral little  Hot pants number  Right  The boy shorts  Can't understand why  No one would want that  Now let me ask you  I hope he was joking  About being a size queen  But I know this is  Something I don't understand  Because there's always  This misconception  That women are obsessed  With the size of a guy's genitals  And women always go  No we're not  That's a guy thing  Men are obsessed with that  Are  Is that important to gay men  Being  Is that like a male thing 
[02:58:30]  Or are we right about  Women being obsessed  With that too  I have no idea  No idea  That's a good question  Actually  It is a good question  It's like  I implore you guys  To do an online poll  And ask people  Because I don't know  The guy probably  You know  I bet you could give us  Your own opinion  But that would not be  The opinion of all gentlemen  No no dude  I'm only asking you  As a person  Like with breasts  I have a preference  I prefer medium  To smaller breasts  I don't really like  Big tits  It's just not my thing 
[02:59:00]  You would think  A gay guy would want  A small one  So his bunghole  Doesn't get stretched out  Well see  That's another stereotype  Opie  And I  You know  I mean  We can all understand  A finger  But my god  I'd like to  What?  I'd like to apologize  Yeah  For Opie's behavior  During this interview  Who's Opie?  Trying to get some  Information out  And talk about the show  The Apprentice  Sundays on NBC  9 to 10 p.m. 
[02:59:30]  Right  Eastern time  You're from Atlanta  I am  Yeah  I love it  It's a great city  That's good  What does your family  Back home  If you're still speaking  To them  Say about the show  I do still speak to them  Oh good  Absolutely  They are loving  Wonderful people  And they  You know  They have no problem  With it whatsoever  Again  I mean  They think that  You're going to understand  I mean  You have to  You beat out  Thousands of people 
[03:00:00]  To be on the show  Just to be on the show  Right  And there are certain  Credentials that you  Have to have  To even be there  And so  You know  To have that  And have the opportunity  To do it  Is just cool  And on  It's itself  Yeah  What did you  What did you  Think of the Donald  Uh  It  A little  A little abrasive  It is  Like you know  Nice guy  I mean  Probably  Honestly  Probably  Someone that's  Very very real  Like  You meet people  Or I do  In my daily life 
[03:00:30]  People who  Have a lot of money  Or owe money  Or new money  Or things of that nature  And they're always  Going to power  Star girl  And he's just  He's one of those guys  That's so laid back  About it  That it's like  Oh you kind of  Like that about him  Oh yeah  He's very vicious  Yeah  Do you care  Honestly  Like this is the thing  A lot of people  Would say about the apprentice  Like do you care  Like does  I just  Does the size matter  Like does it matter  Is it a length  Or girth thing  Or is it irrelevant to you  About the apprentice  Yeah 
[03:01:00]  No no no  I'm saying  When you're talking  About something  Like I'm talking  About like a guy's  A guy's hog  Does the size of it matter  Like is it a thickness thing  Or does the length  Make any difference  Obviously one would hurt  More than the other  But I'm saying  Does it matter to you  At all  Is that something  You look for in a person  Or is it irrelevant to you  Okay  So that's irrelevant to me  But in the  It gets in the area  Of selling a bathing suit  That people would  Probably buy  A smaller bathing suit  If they've got something  To show off  But I'm saying  Personally  If you're meeting a person 
[03:01:30]  Like I have certain  Physical requirements  With a woman  These things I like  That is something  Like that is not  An issue for you  Is the size of the genitals  Right  I don't think  That's an issue  With most people  Now you're the  President owner  Of a marketing  And promotions firm  Oh wonderful  Oh that's  That's a nice  Occupation  Something to get into  What do you promote  We  Well  We promote  A lot of things 
[03:02:00]  I mean we basically  Like our niches  New product launches  So people come to you  And say  Hey I got this product  I'd like you to  Market this  Or promote it  And you put your own  Special little twist on it  Do you think  Your appearance  On The Apprentice  Is going to maybe  Prejudice people  To think hey  I don't want to bring  A vacuum  To this guy to market  Because he might just  Put a set of man's lips  On the front  Where it's supposed  To suck up the dirt  And nothing like that  Right  No  Not at all  I mean 
[03:02:30]  Again  Guys this is a creative task  It doesn't have to do  With marketing  Sorry that's  We're doing  That shouldn't have happened  We're doing another contest  In the other room  I'm sorry  This might sound like  A silly question  I didn't mean to harp  On the general  I'm actually asking you  Legitimately  But with  Like with balls 
[03:03:00]  How about  Big heavy low hangers  No  No  Who would like those  Never seen

[03:06:30]  The whole package  On our show  Vagina equals yuck  Right  Wow  I mean you got something  Very interesting  And intriguing  Listeners at this point  But I'm saying  It doesn't matter  What you like  You're just a guy  You're a guy  You're a president  Owner of a marketing  Promotions firm  You're on a very successful  TV show  Why does it have to be  Questions about  You know sexuality  That's what I don't  Agree with 
[03:07:00]  With these two  That I'm sitting in the room  I'm not questioning his sexuality  And I don't have any problem  With it actually  I just ask the questions  Well you shouldn't question it  Because first of all  None of your business  Second of all  It's been answered  He's open about it  So that's not my issue  I don't have an issue  I was just curious  And there's things  That you can't ask a lot of  Even if a guy  Didn't identify himself  As being gay  I probably wouldn't ask him that  Even if I knew he was gay  Because that's his thing  His secret  But he identifies himself  As being a gay guy  He doesn't sound gay  No he doesn't  Of course that again  Is making assumptions 
[03:07:30]  That gay guys  Can be identified  Through just sound  What to you  Is a gay sound  Well it would be  A stereotypical  Let's say village  Halloween parade  Interview kind of gay  Lisp guy  This guy has a very  Professional  Well spoken voice  Yes  That doesn't give a hint  Of having swallowed  A man's cock  I'm just saying  You know  To be blunt  Because these idiots  Have obviously gotten  Nothing but cretins 
[03:08:00]  Listening to this program  That's right  I figured I'd just dive in  You know  You're gonna  You're gonna hang out  With the pigs  Sometimes you gotta  Get a little mud on you  Right  That's what I'm saying  They're patted  Alright  Well  The Apprentice  Is the other  Gay gentleman  Still on the show  Derek yeah  He really  He's still  He's on the show  Right now  As we speak  Did you  Maybe talk about  You know  A little something 
[03:08:30]  I'm suspicious  That they kicked off  The gay guy  Why  Just for  I think  There's something  That has something  To do with America  And their taste  I'm suspicious  What  Suspicious  No  I'm suspicious  Why kick the gay guy  Off early  Maybe because  His men's line  Didn't really go over  Too well  With middle America  It's kind of hard  To push off  I gotta say  Let's play devil's out of here  It's hard to kind of  Like a hot  Pink floral hot pants  Is tough to model  To most guys 
[03:09:00]  Were you modeling it  For the gay community  Or was it for  You know  That was definitely  A gay city  What you guys don't  Understand about  She's got a boutique  In Palm Springs  Where when we met  With her  She told us  That  75% of the consumers  That come in that store  Are gay male consumers  We knew that  While designing  These things  Alright  That makes sense  Just pulled us out of our ass  And decided to go with  Some crazy  Way to phrase it  Yeah yeah  You don't  You don't want to use  That term I don't think  Exactly  Because that implies  You had to get in there  Jesus Christ  It's you guys 
[03:09:30]  We don't have  Self control sir  You can't just  Throw that at us  Yeah  And not expect us  To react on that one  Yes  Got it  But the point is  I don't understand  Like a model  A bathing suit  Yeah I think you're  Being way too stereotypical  I don't think  Gay guys want to wear  Hot floral pink  Bathing suits  Call me crazy but  How about modeling  Put a  Why don't you make  A bathing suit  With a little plastic penis  Already inserted in the back  So when they're at the beach  They can enjoy the  Why are you smiling  In the water all the time  Well it's this new suit I got  The brand new suit I got 
[03:10:00]  Yeah  And you know  The other funny part is  That I think that  You know  While  And Trump was like  Oh there's no market for this  Right  Gay men buy  Probably two bathing suits  Or three bathing suits a year  While I'm sure you guys  Have had the same bathing suit  For you know  Two years  Three years  Since Spiro Agnew  Is probably  Yeah  Look I gotta tell you  You don't have to be  You don't have to be  A gay guy  To realize that  No gay guy's  Buying this silly suit  No but they buy  More  Gay guys  He's saying  Buy more  Bathing suits 
[03:10:30]  Than straight men  Straight men usually  Buy bathing trunks  And the backs  Never wear out  I'm good out of your seasons  I guess  Oh I was assuming  I was assuming  I'm sorry  I'm making ass  Out of you and me  As they say  Assume  So the other gay contestant  Still in  Which is good  We're rooting for the gay guy  Yeah  I really do  That's why we wanted you  On the show  You let us down  We're rooting for the gay guy 
[03:11:00]  It's very rare  When you get like a gay guy  On a reality show  Oh is that rare?  It depends on which one  You're watching  Yeah I know  How old were you  That's my joke  How old were you  When you told your parents  Were they bothered  Or they didn't care?  No they didn't care  It's one of the things  That mean  Well you are who you are  That's nice  Supportive  Yeah  Do they already know?  Absolutely yeah  How do they know?  Was it behaviorally?  Or had they  Had they walked in on  On  How do you say this 
[03:11:30]  Without being offended  Had they walked in on  Maybe you and a friend  Say  Doing the old  Put the lock in this monster  Wow  No  It's a very candid  Conversation that I had  With them  That's good  How old  How old were you  About  I think  About 23  24  Oh so it's not  That long ago  Recently  Okay  Now who is  Are both your parents alive?  Yeah  They are  So was it 
[03:12:00]  And did you bang broads  Before this?  Yeah  I'm sorry?  Did you ever give a woman a shot?  Did you bang broads?  I think everybody's dated a woman  Oh  Yeah  You didn't like it right?  Did you just  Did it gross you out  Or was it just  Didn't do nothing for you?  It just didn't work  We'll say that  Yeah  Didn't get a rod?  I'm sorry?  Were you able to get a rod?  Were you able to get a rod at least?  I mean I like women  I've lost rods with women  Plenty of times  Wow  That's slightly personal  No  I love women 
[03:12:30]  I loved them in the past  They are  My  I'm sure women love you too  Nothing better than an in shape  Gay guy to go shopping with and stuff  Maybe you're bisexual  That's true  Yeah  Nah  Do you think  You like white guys or black guys?  It doesn't really matter  I don't really  I don't date a lot  I don't have a lot of time for dating  Anything but Asian, right?  I hear you  Hey  Do you like bears?  We have a guy on this show 
[03:13:00]  Who has admitted that he actually had sex with a transsexual  Which is incomprehensible to most of us  What in your opinion does that make that person?  I don't know  I'm not really  I don't do transsexuals  It's not a  No  Why?  What are you a communist?  What?  No  You know  Gay guys can just be businessmen and stuff  It doesn't have to be some kind of a freak show  Like I mentioned before  The Halloween parade or something  It doesn't have to be this extravagant  Over the top flamboyant exposition 
[03:13:30]  Yeah  This guy's a businessman  He's a businessman  Of course he is  Who happens to  I don't know why  Like why does it have to say  Show him a copy  Does everyone else's bio say  Like you know  Bob is a businessman  And he's straight  And  I don't know why  Why does gay have to be in your bio?  It's an issue  Maybe it's not  Did you put it in your bio?  Because honestly  That piqued our interest obviously  But if it just said  Corey is one of the male contestants this season 
[03:14:00]  Then  Then  Whatever  I don't  I don't actually know  Why all you guys are speaking of  Because the ones that are on the website  For Yahoo and NBC  Don't reference sexuality  No  So I have no idea  Yeah but the picture shows you kissing another man  Does it?  Yeah  No of course not  Might as well  Jimmy  Jesus  Literal idiot  I do it by completely  A little joke  Hey let me ask you a question  Now you said you talked to your folks when you were 23  And they never walked in on anything like that was suspicious? 
[03:14:30]  No not at all  At all  Like you and your friend under the blankets  And your hands were moving  And you said  No no no  We're playing  No I don't  I was never that guy  And I never will be that guy  I've been obviously very focused on  My life  My career  Education  Yeah  Making things happen  You know  I'll leave you guys  Do a couple more interviews  Sexuality is a part of his life  It's not his entire life  Hey Kerry  Can you tell if someone's gay by their voice? 
[03:15:00]  Because we can  We're really good at that  I don't think so  I wouldn't have gotten him  I would not  Speaking to  Yeah I would  I would not have gotten any  Like  The gaydar detector wouldn't have gone off  I hear that he might have  Did some schooling overseas  Yeah?  A little bit  Like where?  Oxford  Oxford  Oxford  Yes  Did you ever do any schooling overseas?  Where were you educated sir?  Here in Atlanta actually  In Atlanta  See how he says Atlanta 
[03:15:30]  I know  I kind of like that  Yeah  Yeah  So  Well guys  And you don't have a southern accent  Yeah  No southern  No I don't  Have you tried to shed that?  What about the  No  I lived in the city all my life  So  There's no  I mean I guess if you live out  South on a farm  You have an accent  But I live here  Ever since I was born  There's one right here in the city  In the town  Let me ask you  A serious question here  Atlanta  A lot of rednecks down there  How do they handle the gay? 
[03:16:00]  The city's fine  I mean we don't really  Venture outside the city limits  That much for anything  So  You know we don't have a problem  With it  There's a huge community down here  In midtown actually  And  The homeboys accept you  Or you're not street enough?  Um  Yeah  That's a tough one  Let me ask you a question  And this is not to be disrespectful  Do you prefer to be more  The aggressive one  Or the non-aggressive one  In that type of an encounter?  Yeah, power bottom? 
[03:16:30]  Wow  Yeah  Definitely  A question that  Would not be answered  You don't want to answer that?  Oh wow  Now we've gone too far  Respect the man's privacy  I don't know  I don't mean to be  I'm just asking  I don't know it's appropriate  I see  Well guys  I hate to  Wait  Wait  Wait  Wait  Wait  My black friend here  It's Martin Luther King Day  It's Martin Luther King Day  What does Martin Luther  What does Martin Luther King  Mean  To you  Carrie  From The Apprentice  Who got kicked off  Last night  On NBC  9 to 10pm  Eastern time

Thanks  That stupid Mets hat  Star Casino, by the way  Here it is  You want to get it  Get a little piece of that  So I'm digging this song  From Luminous 2  They got a lot of cool music  In the game  It's for the PSP 
[03:24:30]  This is Star Casino  Stroll around the world  Just a piece  You can only get 30 seconds  Because I guess the band's  From Japan or something  Japan  And to download  All the way from Japan  Ooh  Oh  That's another piece  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh 
[03:25:00]  Oh  There you go.  A little taste.  That's it?  You like that?  I like that.  Yeah, I like that.  Does it have a hook?  Dude, I'm a fucking music jock for way too long, so anything different I like.  But does it have a hook?  That was it.  Strolling around the world, yeah.  Did they sing in English or Japanese? 
[03:25:30]  That was in English.  That's the funny part.  They're in Japanese trying to sing in English.  That was rough.  Is that a fan from Opie's game called Sars Casino?  Steve, you have fun at the old adult expo out there in Vegas?  Yeah.  Yes, I did.  It's always fun.  It's always fun to go there and check out the weirdos and just say hi to friends.  It's interesting trying to keep up with Jimmy because I walk in there together with Jimmy 
[03:26:00]  and Jimmy just blows by the line.  It's very hard to keep track of him because he's got his own agenda.  Grr.  Exactly.  Grr.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We got that clip from last year.  That's right.  Grr.  Hopefully we'll have a new one to add to the collection.  The whole bear thing came from the first one.  Yeah, yeah.  It did.  Here's some bear.  He's cozy.  Here's some bear.  I just think when we talk to these guys, it's not like I want them to say anything in  particular because I never would have thought Grr was going to be a funny clip.  Grr.  Never.  I saw him do that. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  I was holding the mic when that happened.  I had no idea.  You picked that out.  Legendary.  So I don't know what to look for or what not to look for, to be very honest with you.  Grr.  Come on, sweetie.  That's a dumb email.  The place I wanted is sold.  I'll never find a fucking place.  You'll be homeless forever.  Holy shit.  Anyway, sorry.  I shouldn't look at that.  I'll put it over there.  So, all right, Steve.  So now, you two at the expo. 
[03:27:00]  Do we have Buck first or no?  No, I just got done cutting that up.  Don't scream at me.  I'm sorry.  Buck?  Buck Angel.  Buck Angel, the man with the pussy.  He's a man with a pussy.  Yeah.  No, he's not.  Oh, yes, he is.  Oh, wait.  I've seen pictures.  Wait, what is this?  We've seen pictures of him.  I've got to get back in the game here.  Yeah, we've seen pictures.  Buck Angel.  Buck is this bald white guy with a lot of tribal tattoos, and he's got a vagina.  He looks like he'll kick your ass, right?  Yeah, kind of.  Like, he looks like another prison guy that should be in the Aryan section of the prison. 
[03:27:30]  Very much so.  And he's all man, except for his vagina.  That kind of.  Is it man-made, or he was born that way?  I think it was man-made.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I couldn't.  I think Buck was born a girl with girl parts and went.  Really?  And then just went and got the hormones.  Yeah, I think it's a female to male.  It's testosterone.  Got a clit-like fucking arm, or what?  We saw the picture of it. 
[03:28:00]  I can't look at it.  It's very disturbing.  It is, because he's very mannish, but there's no penis.  How do you fuck that?  How does anyone look at that?  How do you not?  How do you not?  It's disturbing, because it smells different.  Oh, God.  Oh, do I so much Purell?  Yeah, you're Purelling too much.  What are you doing?  You know what's going to happen?  I found photographs.  You know what's going to happen?  What?  What happened?  Remember what?  Ew.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  Well, how'd you have four of these ready?  Get the fuck out of here. 
[03:28:30]  Told you.  That's real, too.  What the fuck?  That's him.  I hate to weigh the pants are down, and they're still on.  That's the grossest part of the picture.  It's not the man with the cunt.  It's the fact that the fucking pants are still on.  Like, you just pulled them down for a quick photo.  Dude, this is the type of guy that would fuck you up, but he can't fuck you.  That is beyond freakish.  It's disgusting.  Yeah.  That could be one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen, right there.  Right there.  Today.  Mark the day down.  It's a biker dude.  Right.  It's a fucking biker dude.  Shaved head.  He's got the Ray-Bans. 
[03:29:00]  He's got the scary facial hair.  You know, he knows how to shape it.  Tats all over.  Make it look scary.  And a shaved pussy.  Yep.  That's Buck.  Works out like a motherfucker, like, in the prison yard.  Mm-hmm.  Is he a gay guy?  I don't know what he is.  And does he do movies?  Does he do movies?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a performer.  And guys fuck him.  Yeah.  He offered to fuck me, too.  Oh, yeah, did he?  Yeah, I think so.  Or you to fuck him. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  You got a lot of offers, Buck.  Yeah, I got a lot of offers.  I was the fat chick in this whole scenario.  Oh, why are you?  Wow, Steve just going over.  And he goes, do you want to go grab some more audio?  I'm like, all right.  He couldn't wait to get over there with the audio.  Let's go back.  It's like, Jesus, Steve, we got 20 hours of audio already.  Grab some more audio.  Leave the recorder here.  Steve, you forgot the recorder.  Oh, yeah.  I'll memorize what they say.  Right.  Well, like Jimmy said, you never know what clips are going to go over.  So I just wanted to get as much as possible on that. 
[03:30:00]  Dude, we need to know more about this guy.  Is that man-made or was he born that way?  That's fucked up.  Let's get him on the phone.  Let's get Buck Angel on the phone.  He'll talk.  He was very cool on the air.  How does Buck?  He obviously has no female hormones.  Look at this guy.  There's nothing female about him except for, you know, where it matters.  If he was a girl that turned into a guy.  No way.  Because they could do that with certain hormones.  No testosterone.  Yeah, yeah.  Wouldn't he still have like a uterus and ovaries behind those abs? 
[03:30:30]  Isn't that a horrible thought?  Like baby-making shit in there?  Yeah, I'm fucking pregnant.  God damn it.  I knew that would fucking happen.  Fuck.  I'm going to have to punch myself in the stomach.  Ah, shit.  You know, I'm going to stick to just getting fucked in the ass.  Oh, it's awful.  I can't look at it, but I can't look away.  Get a better picture of it. 
[03:31:00]  So I've got to cover it up.  Get a better picture.  There's a better picture of it.  You've got to look.  Steve, your wallet, better picture.  You've got to look.  Get a better photo of Buck Angel's genitals.  All right, so you guys talked to Diesel Washington.  Yeah.  Now we're changing gears.  This is the guy you guys were talking about earlier.  Mm-hmm.  It's a big black.  Big black homosexual who came up to me.  He was a fan.  He just loved me.  He was very funny.  But I don't, from what I remember.  Sam's laughing as he hands out another. 
[03:31:30]  More pictures?  God.  Is that who that was originally?  No kidding.  I've never seen Sam work so hard and so fast.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That?  That's the same guy?  Yeah.  Now we're looking at a young, like, Bridget Nielsen.  She's not bad looking.  So that's a woman to man?  You know what?  Give it away?  The ears.  The ears give it away.  Wait.  What is this?  That's before.  This is her before.  Holy shit.  So she turned into that fucking biker dude guy.  Yeah.  No way.  The pussy is real.  She's cute. 
[03:32:00]  As a girl.  That's not as gross to me.  Yeah, but she has man hands.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, he's right.  She's not as gross to me, except for the facial hair.  At least the pussy is real.  We've got to stop with science.  Stop.  Yeah, I agree.  No more inventions.  It's over.  Wait.  We've invented everything we need.  It's the same person.  Yeah.  But you pretty much decorate it up different, and you're a faggot if you fuck it. 
[03:32:30]  You can't fuck that and be a heterosexual.  Dude.  You can fuck this.  You're hetero.  Dude, look at that picture.  Holy mother of Christ.  How do people get to this?  They're giving the pile driver to old Buck Angel.  But he's all dude, except he doesn't have a dude.  I don't get this one.  No, it's Buck...  That was a girl.  Buck-angel.com.  Link it up.  What happened?  Oh, no.  What do you have, Sam? 
[03:33:00]  Not Sam.  Slow down a little bit.  Jesus.  Sam's got...  He knew the address.  I've got to say that.  Oh, God.  That's like...  There's like a cock there.  That's a nice pussy.  No, it's not.  That's a nice pussy, unless it's man-made, then it's disgusting.  That's not a nice pussy.  No, that's a cock with a scrotum with no balls in it as pussy lips.  Maybe it's a hermaphrodite.  If you do a Google image search for Buck Angel, you'll find all these wonderful pictures.  Wow. 
[03:33:30]  What the fuck?  Wow, Sam.  That is...  Can we get Buck-A's on the phone?  Let me try.  Really?  Let's go.  I bet the hormones to make him a guy has grown that clit into what appears to be a cock.  Testosterone makes your guy think.  Am I wrong?  Jimmy, would you have sex with us?  Absolutely not.  The only redeeming thing I would say is if it started out a woman and she just got testosterone,  that's not as bad to me.  But if that pussy... 
[03:34:00]  If that's a guy who had a pussy put on, that's almost...  I can't look at it.  It's almost...  He can't look at it.  Almost.  Almost.  No, no, no.  But if that's a real woman...  No, you've got to look.  I mean, you've got to look for...  That's what it was.  It was a woman at first.  I don't know.  It doesn't matter.  Because the way this photo is taken...  The one picture we have of Buck Angel, he's naked, wearing sunglasses with facial hair  and the pussy.  But in this other photo, there's this Brigitte Nielsen looking chick.  However, she's wearing a jacket.  And the way the jacket is, it's open, but you cannot see any area that... 
[03:34:30]  Those tattoos could be there under that jacket.  And you can't tell if there's tits there or if that's just a little shadowing.  Well, that's way before, because...  You don't know that, though.  Yeah, I think...  There's no tats there.  I know, but the tattoos...  Look where the tattoos are on the body.  Oh, yeah, wait a minute.  Now, if you look closely...  Yeah, the neck.  The neck one, you're right.  But she's wearing a fucking neck scarf.  No, this must be pre-op.  Or, I mean, pre, you know...  That's years before, obviously.  But he had to have, what, a fucking mastectomy? 
[03:35:00]  How does this chick turn into a guy and get a guy's chest?  I'd like to know myself.  Double mastectomy.  No, you would think, like, there would be some kind of a hint of it still being a female chest, no?  They cut out her tits.  They just suck it all out?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, come on, man.  Now we need to know more.  This is a little...  Well, we got to get Buck...  We have audio, but Steve, just tell Steve to bring the audio.  We have a Buck.  You can hear the voice.  Steve!  Would you like a drink?  Buck.  That's a weird voice.  B-d-b-d-b-d-b-d.  All right, let's get the D's of Washington on. 
[03:35:30]  I hate it, Tweaky.  And then we'll get to Buck Angel maybe tomorrow.  Buck.  Oh, yeah.  We got to get to Francine still.  We got to...  Oh, yeah.  Don't Purell it as much.  Yeah, it's bad for you, dude.  You don't want to get more germs in here.  You'll get, um, warts.  No, I won't.  Yeah.  Yes, you will.  I'm wart-proof.  Remember, we were talking with, uh, deal or no deal there.  Howie?  Howie Mandel said he was using that, like, all the time.  And it not only killed the germs, but it killed the good germs that keep away things like warts. 
[03:36:00]  Right, right.  And you'll start getting warts on your hands.  All right, I'll stop.  Speaking of Bob Saget...  All right, I'll stop.  Why isn't 1 vs. 100 on, like, at a better time?  I don't even know when it's on.  That show's amazing.  I wish I watched...  Maybe it's on Friday nights.  It's on regular television.  VBR, it's entertaining as hell.  It probably does numbers in that slot in very few...  Friday night?  Who's fucking watching unless you're taping it?  Uh, older demo that doesn't go out.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I would think it's one of those shows you should move up at this point. 
[03:36:30]  All right, we got to get Saget on the phone and ask him that.  Where's, uh, Steve?  Are we going to play the Steeves of Washington, or...?  There he is.  Steve's chatting.  He's getting the Buck Angel thing, so...  He's getting the Buck Angel thing, so...  He's getting the Buck Angel thing.  Oh, boy.  Well, we could wait...  Buck could wait till tomorrow.  Yeah, Buck's going to have to wait.  Buck ain't going anywhere.  Yeah.  No.  In every way possible.  Buck will still be just like that.  A man with a cunt.  All right.  So, were you intimidated by Diesel Washington?  You're a big guy, Steve.  Uh...  You're big.  You work out a lot.  Were you intimidated by this guy in any way? 
[03:37:00]  After he started talking, yes.  Yeah, absolutely.  He's...  You know, it was very approachable.  He recognized Jimmy first.  Was the...  Like, we were doing an interview with this other guy, Tober, who was this...  This, uh...  He was wearing all these weird strappy, leather, chappy kind of things.  And, uh...  And then, uh...  Diesel walked over, grabbed Jim, and said,  Dude, you're fucking hysterical.  And so we went over and talked to, uh...  Talked to Diesel.  And then once Diesel got rolling, that's when it was kind of intimidating.  That's when I got nervous.  Is it true he fists guys up to his elbow?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  He was very proud about that.  Whether they want it or not.  Diesel's a problem.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Diesel is very aggressive.  He is very aggressive.  And...  He's fucking...  His name should be Timothy Topp.  I agree with Michael Williams today from Ohio.  What's Mikey say?  Opie, I love the show, but I really don't want to hear about faggots anymore.  Yeah.  You have not even begun to hear.  Dipped into the gay zone a bit, but, uh...  A little bit.  Oh, you're about to dive headlong into the gay zone.  All right.  Here's, uh, Diesel Washington, the interview from the Adult Expo out there in Vegas a couple 
[03:38:00]  of days ago.  What kind of porn would Steve do well in?  What's your name?  Diesel Washington.  Diesel.  We are taking audio of my friend Steve.  Now, here's the thing we're doing.  It's for a radio show.  Okay.  But I'm convinced, and every year we find people, he should be doing, uh, adult films, uh,  gay adult films.  Okay.  What category do you think he would fit into?  Uh, Harry Bear.  Um, a little bit of the mustache, maybe the style of the hair, and he probably has, yeah, 
[03:38:30]  lots of chest hair.  Now, is that the type of fellow that you like?  Um, I like all types, really, so I can't discriminate.  Now, someone like that, would he appear to be dominant or submissive?  He would be submissive.  Aw.  Yeah.  Not even a hesitation.  I explain.  We don't understand.  From my point of view, because I'm dominant, so maybe you, I'll probably roll him over in  a bed and probably try to get my hand up his ass.  I don't, on the first date?  Well, yeah, I may throw a drink down your throat, loosen you up a little bit, spit on  the hole, give you a little bit of lube, and then I'll put a hand in. 
[03:39:00]  Tire hand.  Tire hand.  Try to get it up to the wrist, maybe.  Now, how about, he's a submissive, which was a good call on your part.  Yes.  He likes being spanked.  Would that be something you would do to him?  Yes.  Paddle, bare hand, maybe a strap.  That would be cool.  Straight bare hand.  Spit on it first to give it a kiss of luck.  And maybe play with his titties.  Wow.  Yeah.  You know he's not starting with, like, a pinky and going, are you okay? 
[03:39:30]  No.  Does this hurt?  No.  He said spit on the hole.  It's just sticking his entire fist right up your ass like he's punching your fucking  sphincter.  That's right.  When he was taking a picture with those other guys, he was grabbing their asses the way I  would with two smaller chicks.  Exactly.  Spit on the hole.  Oh.  Oh, no. 
[03:40:00]  Special delivery from Snap.  Here comes another, uh...  Jesus.  Oh, there he is.  I know these photos are all from Sam's photo library.  Wow.  We told him to stop 20 minutes ago.  He can't get enough of the cock.  That guy gets a hold of you.  It's fucking over.  It's fucking over.  Yeah.  It is game over.  It's like Conan the Barbarian.  Only black and gay.  I'm guessing he's at large genitals.  He's black.  And I hope he takes those studded wristbands off before he decides to fist you to the elbow. 
[03:40:30]  Oh.  Oh, shish.  Is there more of Diesel's description?  Yeah.  There's one more track.  I can't find the other track.  Oh, there it is.  Right there.  Oh, it's right there.  Just turn it right there.  I'm glad we're celebrating Martin Luther King Day in this fashion.  Like a black gentleman.  If you were going to be in a scene with him, how would it start off and how would you dominate  him for this?  Like, what would you say to him? 
[03:41:00]  What would the dialogue be?  Or just a rough idea of what the dialogue would be.  Yeah.  It doesn't start off like a hand up ass.  It starts.  No.  It'll first come in.  Come in.  You're going to do everything I say.  If you don't do anything I say, I'm going to smack you across the face.  You can make this easy.  He's a hopeless romantic.  But Steve's a big guy.  Yeah.  If you don't do what I'm going to say, I'm going to smack you across the face.  I'm going to smack you across the face.  Oh, this is crazy.  This guy will fucking, you will submit or he will fucking rape you.  Oh, who is this?  Oh, my God. 
[03:41:30]  I don't know.  Some intern just brought in a bunch of dick pictures.  Oh, my God.  Lewis, look at this little fella.  I thought this was Diesel.  I don't want these random cock pics.  I didn't say get me black cock to celebrate.  I said get me black cock.  It's okay if it's Diesel's cock, but Jesus.  Deciding to bring in dick pictures?  Jesus.  Well, it looks like we picked another great crew.  It certainly did.  Cross the face.  Now, you can make this easy or you can make it hard.  If you make it easy, you do everything I say.  Be obedient, a loyal. 
[03:42:00]  Start off on your knees first.  Sniff my balls with your nose first.  Then I'll pull out my cock.  Sub it in the back of your throat.  Smack it in the face a couple of times.  Then bend you over.  Spit into your asshole.  Work two fingers in there.  Open it up in a circular fashion.  Then I'll work my fist in you.  And if you're good, then maybe I'll throw my dick in you.  What is he?  That sounds awfully intimidating.  It's very direct.  Very.  Sounds like you've done this before.  Many times.  And everybody's always happy with the result. 
[03:42:30]  If they're not, hey, as long as I got off.  Very forceful gentleman.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't give a...  I'm interested.  The two fingers.  Now, he would stick two fingers up your spit-ridden ass.  Right.  And now, in a circular fashion.  So, is he going in a circle as he slowly spreads those two fingers apart, thus making the hole big enough for another finger? 
[03:43:00]  And then the fist?  Probably.  It certainly sounds like that he was talking about.  I'm not sure about how this fist-up-the-ass thing works, Dan.  Dan knows about fisting.  No, I was picturing more like somebody trying to get...  Where's Dan?  I just see a man in a Boris Karloff wig.  I have a bad haircut.  Do you?  I want to chase you with a torch.  I used that in my act.  Are you implying I stole that?  I didn't see you do that.  That's funny. 
[03:43:30]  Is it new?  Thief.  People are calling this the ICOC hour.  ICOC.  So, you were picturing more...  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  Stan, I was interrupting you.  I want to hear Stan's...  Moss stuff.  More like you're trying to get that last bit of peanut butter out.  Sort of that kind of motion with the two fingers.  Oh, like, so on the side of the jar.  So, instead of a concentric pressure emanating from the center out, you're going with one 
[03:44:00]  side and then scooping and making it wider.  Scraping the ball for all that kind of stuff.  Scraping the ball.  Scraping the ball.  Perhaps.  Oh, oh, okay.  Steve's awful.  I was thinking more like a centrifugal clutch where you spin and the, you know, contacts  spread out.  All right.  Okay.  I know nothing about this ass sex.  Same result.  Same result.  Oh, you just, you, you know, ultimately you have to widen it open to get the other fingers  in.  To get that big black hand up your ass. 
[03:44:30]  Up your elbow.  I just don't...  I'm not even big on anal sex.  Like, if a girl wants me to fuck her in the ass, occasionally.  I'm not even...  Yeah.  I don't know why I'm not big.  I wish I was a bigger fan because it's degrading.  And you like that?  I do not.  I like the spit of a girl's face.  I like that.  I thought you liked being degraded.  I have been degraded, too.  But you like it both ways.  I fucking one-way Charlie.  You give, you take.  Yeah.  It makes the world go round.  Yeah, you squeeze the face, the mouth opens, you spit into it, swallow. 
[03:45:00]  Good.  Get a rod.  Handsome.  Oh, this is...  Look at some of those pictures.  That better go away.  I was telling Steve as I was...  I just can't comprehend it.  I can't comprehend...  Well, we missed the obvious here.  Let's go to Brian in New York, Brian.  Yes, we did.  I don't know if we did.  Brian?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm just amazed, man.  After this guy fished you up to his fucking elbow, then he's going to stick his dick in  you and still get off?  He's killing me.  This guy must be hung like a fucking dinosaur.  Well, that's why I demanded a picture of Diesel's cock, and the interns are hogging 
[03:45:30]  them all for themselves, and laughing, and Fat Headfield back there is just giggling and kissing carbon paper.  Fat Headfield.  All right, well, time to end the sexiness and get back to basic shit.  Tomorrow we got buzzed.  Francine talked about her pussy.  Well, okay, that un-gays it up.  I think Francine is sexy. 
[03:46:00]  Francine, our...  White black, by the way.  Again, because of Martin Luther King Day, a black woman.  She's a girl.  Black girl, but raised in, like, Connecticut, came from money.  So she is what Bob Kelly calls white black.  Well, we're talking about, obviously, the weekend shows.  In general, the weekend shows are really good.  When you get, like, the regulars doing it, it's good.  And then, like, this Saturday, we decide...  Enough! 
[03:46:30]  Sam, in with another picture.  Hot off the presses.  Oh, my God, Diesel.  Thank you, Sam.  Jesus Christ.  All right, that...  It just...  All right.  Holy shit.  That's Diesel...  Yum.  I mean, uh...  Jesus.  Diesel's cock is giant.  If your asshole misbehaves, Diesel Washington's cock will straighten it out.  He doesn't even have a complete part on there. 
[03:47:00]  That's, like, as hard as he can get without fainting.  He's probably 10 by 6.  Because all the blood weighs it back down.  Yeah.  There's too much blood.  The cock's too heavy for whatever muscles to hold up.  Too much blood in the cylinder, so it's got to start going back down the other way.  Holy mother...  Can you imagine putting your fingers in Steve's ass and squishing them around to fuck it?  I...  It's almost...  And I can talk about beheadings.  That almost makes me wretch.  Almost?  Well, I mean, to talk about it. 
[03:47:30]  To put your fingers in that awful weight loss asshole, which you know is flappy.  Yeah.  Because all the weight he lost, and squishing your finger had the stink off the hair on  his asshole.  Oh, God.  Steve's ass wouldn't smell good after a shower, much less when he's nervous.  With a man dredging his ass out so he could fit that fucking mule in there.  After a hard day of sitting in that fucking production office for a total of six minutes,  apparently.  All right.  Let's... 
[03:48:00]  We want to squeeze this in here, so...  Yeah.  Squeeze it in.  So, Saturday, we had a little experiment, because the regulars were out of town, and  we threw Dee Dee and Francine on 2-0-2.  Not at the same time, of course.  Oh, I thought they did the shirt again.  No, they did an hour each or something like that to our...  I don't know, because I didn't listen.  There was no reason to listen.  But, Ant, did you tune in or something?  Because you were the one in the office going, what the fuck is going on on the weekend?  No, because I had heard about what was going on.  I did not tune in.  I was very, very busy. 
[03:48:30]  I wasn't doing anything.  But, uh, Dee Dee's show, apparently, was Dee Dee.  It was called Dee Dee's Basement, uh, talking about everything.  Kind of a free-form thing.  Whereas, Francine, apparently, uh, Than said, was a little more prepared.  And Francine, uh, apparently, also had a partner, an on-air partner, some gentleman,  that left the show.  Just kind of walked off the show, because of some of the things Francine was saying. 
[03:49:00]  Let me ask you a question.  Did we try to get Francine on the phone, or was that guy?  Francine's on the phone!  Francine's on the phone.  Yeah, we do have the other guy's number.  We're trying to get him on, also.  So, Danny, how bad was the show?  You're pretty, uh...  Um...  You're pretty there.  Well, I mean, if you like a show...  I mean, this is Dee Dee first.  She did it, uh, two hours.  And if you like a show, uh, where she talks about eating Bob Kelly's asshole for two straight  hours, then it was a great show.  Why?  Does she like Bob? 
[03:49:30]  No, it's just that it came up on Friday, and her whole show was basically saying,  I'll eat Bob Kelly's asshole for a second show.  And that was the basis of her entire first show.  Jesus.  Wow.  I say we do it.  I completely say.  Just for the hell of that.  Wow.  Just for the goop, I mean.  Wow, these weekends.  Yeah.  Yeah, Francine fared a little better.  She seemed to be a little more prepared.  But the guy that she brought with her seemed to be a little uptight.  He didn't seem familiar with the nature of the program.  Or her?  Or, well...  Like... 
[03:50:00]  And what happened?  He walked off?  Yeah, I mean, they were pretty far into the show.  I mean, they were like 50 minutes in.  You know, they only had a few minutes left to go.  And a caller...  I think you have the caller right there.  A caller made reference to some sexual things.  Right.  And he had had enough.  All right, let's start with...  We got three tracks here, by the way.  Before we even listen, I'm going to think he's got something for Francine.  And he didn't want to sit here and listen to this because it was upsetting him.  I don't know.  Or talking about things sexual. 
[03:50:30]  Is Francine on the phone?  Yeah.  Can I ask her a question?  I have a question for her.  She is black, yes.  Yeah, just hold that because I want to play the first part first and then we'll get to  her when we get to Controversy.  She did a bit called Francine's Pussy.  Yeah, it's a bit she does called Things I've Had in My Pussy.  Oh, all right.  That's cute.  Great, I just said that.  I have shoved up my pussy.  A banana.  A hot dog. 
[03:51:00]  With saran wrap, of course.  Want to be safe.  Wooden artifact was a decoration from my living room set.  Pens.  Pencils.  My electronic toothbrush.  Recommended by your dentist, I hope.  I still have that toothbrush, by the way.  And I still use it.  My teddy bear's nose.  This side of my pillow.  This side of my mattress.  Pressure point massager from Brookstone. 
[03:51:30]  Diesel Washington's fist.  Pressure touch massager from Brookstone.  Percussive massager.  Also another marvelous invention of Brookstone.  She should be faster than anything to have in Brookstone.  I've also put up my pussy ketchup.  Mayonnaise.  To go along with the hot dog, obviously.  No, no.  No?  Separate occasions.  Mustard.  I've sprayed perfume on it, as well.  Well, of course.  Ketchup and mustard.  It stung like a motherfucker.  I won't ever do that shit again.  Three fingers, of course. 
[03:52:00]  Barbie doll parts.  That's when I was 12 or 13 years old.  Bored.  An actual...  And an actual dildo.  Those are all the things I have shoved up my pussy.  Nice.  So you can call me up, 866-WOW-1-WOW, and tell me what you have shoved up your pussy.  I would love to know.  Fucking brilliant.  She deserves another show.  That's how she started her show.  She's great.  She's talking about the stuff she shoved up her pussy. 
[03:52:30]  And you know what?  She's not lying.  No.  That isn't a bit for the show.  She truly has shoved all that shit up her pussy.  One thing I don't like, that dude chiming in.  Yep.  Francine.  Hi, fellas.  Hi, Francine.  Good job at the opening bit.  Thank you.  Happy MLK Day to you, guys.  Happy MLK Day to you.  Thank you.  What, do you got the phone up, your pussy?  You sound a little muffled.  Actually, I'm going to get rid of this one, so it might end up there.  You're a little pussy shoving animal. 
[03:53:00]  That's correct.  Francine, now, who was this guy?  How do you know him?  He's one of my comedy friends that I met doing comedy.  Is he a comedian?  Yes, he is.  How long is he a comedian?  Probably over four years, three, four years.  Where is he from?  Boston, you said?  Yeah, Boston.  What's his name?  Hello?  Yeah, what's his name?  His name's Antony.  Antony what? 
[03:53:30]  Antony Patandreas.  Patandreas?  Yeah.  Never heard of him, sir.  So, now, you thought he's a funny guy.  You know him from doing comedy.  Is he a good comic?  Actually, I thought he was pretty good.  He did regular stand-up comedy, and he also did, like, guitar stuff.  Like, he would sing songs.  Oh, he sounds really original.  How did you get up?  Now, what made you say this is the guy for the radio show with me?  Well, the thing is, I invited a friend, and he never got back to me. 
[03:54:00]  I invited my best friend, who also does television, and he didn't get back to me.  And he and I had actually done, like, a mock show before.  Well, third choice.  Yeah, but he did a mock show with me about a year ago, and I think it went pretty well.  So, I decided to ask him.  Yeah, he was just kind of a distraction there.  He really was.  And why did he walk off the show?  That's what we're trying to get at.  Yeah, I want to know what he's like.  I'm wondering, what the fuck happened? 
[03:54:30]  Well, one guy asked me how I felt about money shots.  And, well, I simply told a story about when I was 14.  And, well, what is that story?  Well, we got the phone call.  Oh, good.  This is where the co-host had a problem.  Here's Francine taking a phone call.  Hold on, Danny.  To set it up a little bit more than that, the guy that was in Anthony, he was getting hammered by the callers.  So, this caller called in and kind of was trying to ease him out of his funk and say, oh, don't worry. 
[03:55:00]  Don't listen to them.  Don't listen to them.  But he was really just digging it home.  How are they getting on him?  We didn't know any of this.  How are they attacking him?  Because they were just telling him, you know, the callers were calling in and just be like, oh, shut up.  Shut up.  Tell them Francine.  Yeah, exactly.  Do we have any of that?  Yeah, listeners know.  They know bad radio.  They have a lot of Ramones.  A lot of Ramones.  Oh, do we have any of those?  Love to hear Ramones, too.  Let's go to Steve in Ohio.  Hello, Steve. 
[03:55:30]  What's up?  What's doing?  You wanted to give me some pointers?  Well, yeah.  You know what, Francine?  Obviously, you sound like a very attractive woman.  And, you know, I want to say that people...  By the way, I lost five pounds for the show today.  Oh, wow, honey.  That's beautiful.  Hey, Anthony, first of all, don't listen to these guys.  You should put your two cents in a lot more.  Thank you.  You know what I mean?  You should be asking Francine a lot more sexual questions, because that's what seems to get people going on her show. 
[03:56:00]  I mean, she's a sexy lady.  It seems that way.  Well, you know, I just wanted to say, I mean, this is a wonderful show.  Well, thank you.  What attracts everybody to you is how you're just open sexually.  So I have just one question.  Okay.  I want to know how you feel about the money shot.  Okay, I've never taken a money shot, but I have swallowed cum, and I'll tell you what happened. 
[03:56:30]  Okay.  So I think I'm about 14 years old, and Anthony, where are you going?  Show is yours.  Okay, so I'm 14, and I'm in the living room with my boyfriend.  How great is Francine?  That's how she...  How do you...  Wow.  Francine's an sociopath.  How do you not love her?  Her co-host just walked in. 
[03:57:00]  She said, where are you going?  Show is yours.  Show is yours.  So I'm 14.  That is the greatest.  It didn't fucking face her.  And she keeps rolling.  If someone spilled water on the console, that would have been more of a distraction.  What a fucking professional.  I got to go back, because you can tell the guy's really pissed, because he slams his pen.  That was the headphones coming off.  Oh, the headphones?  All right.  It sounded like a pen or something, but listen, you can hear him slamming his headphones.  I think I'm about 14 years old, and... 
[03:57:30]  14?  Anthony, where are you going?  Show is yours.  Okay, so I'm 14.  Okay, so I'm 14.  Just like what?  She's a goldfish.  You'll forget he existed.  Eight seconds left.  She started that story.  A goldfish.  That's great.  Where are you going?  Show is yours.  That's it.  All right.  I was 14. 
[03:58:00]  Anthony, where are you going?  Show is yours.  Okay, so I'm 14, and I'm in the living room with my boyfriend, and I'm sucking dick.  And he accidentally, swear to God, he accidentally came in my mouth, because he never did it before, and I wasn't near the bathroom or anything, so I swallowed it. 
[03:58:30]  It was disgusting, but it was the first and only time I've ever swallowed sperm.  Holy shit.  What a great show.  Thank you, Anthony.  Francine, yeah, right on, man.  So you didn't give a shit that he walked out?  Uh, I forgot he walked out as soon as he walked out.  See?  Jimmy's right, like a goldfish.  She just went to call, like, she just started taking calls, and that's where this third track comes in. 
[03:59:00]  Like, she's just going to call, and I felt like I had to interrupt and just be like, Francine, your co-host just left.  Oh, so, and she just didn't even, she was like, yeah, whatever, it's all right.  Francine knew she could carry the whole show.  I thought she was going to make something of it.  She could carry the show.  Good for you, Francine.  That fucking unfunny pussy couldn't handle.  Why did he leave, Francine?  That guy would walk out on a cum-swallowing story.  I know.  What kind of guy?  A 14-year-old cum-swallowing story.  That was a slut.  No, why?  Right to the point, she goes.  Why did he leave? 
[03:59:30]  Well, I actually don't know, because I gave him the format.  Like, I typed it out for him, and he has a copy of it, so he knew exactly what I was actually going to talk about.  Oh.  Um, so I think maybe it might have been that the Ramone callers that really turned him off.  No, it was the cum-swallowing story.  That was what I was going to talk about.  Yeah, that put him over the edge.  Why would that put him over the edge?  Um, I also thought that maybe, perhaps it might have been that, uh, I don't know, maybe he had nothing to put in. 
[04:00:00]  All right, let me, uh, get, put his cock in your mouth.  Let me get to the last track here.  He's telling that story.  He's trying to call him.  He won't know what happens.  He's not picking, we're just going to tell him.  Of course, he's not picking him.  So, Danny, uh, this is the third track, and, uh, she goes back to the phones, and then you go on.  Yeah, she's just about to start taking more phone calls.  I gotta ask, like, I gotta interrupt and find out what the fuck just happened, right?  I gotta ask for us, Francine.  Have you spoken to him since?  Have you spoken to him? 
[04:00:30]  Uh, I spoke to him after the show.  Uh, I tried to call him, because he was supposed to sleep over my house, and he decided to sleep over somebody else's house.  What a dumb motherfucker.  You're, you're talking about putting things in your pussy, putting your swallow in a load, so he walks off the air and stays with a friend.  What a homo.  Would you ever, or have you ever, uh, fucked that guy?  Um, actually, we went out on one day, uh, when I first started doing comedy.  Yeah, and you nailed it.  And did, did, did you have sex with him? 
[04:01:00]  Well, the thing is, I, most of my comedy shows, when I did do a lot of them, had a lot of sexual content.  Yeah.  So, it tends to throw off a lot of the comics, so a lot of them tried to date me, and he was one of them.  All right, so you went out, but was there any sex between you two?  Uh, no, because I, I really wasn't attracted to him in that way.  Yeah, was there anything kissing, or anything?  I mean...  He, he tried to kiss me, uh, when we were, when I was going to my Maranek.  I was trying to go back home in the tree, and I told him no. 
[04:01:30]  Uh-oh.  Yeah, see, here's the deal.  He likes you.  This guy likes you a lot.  And, uh, you talking about that shit disturbed him.  He didn't like hearing about you getting cum in your mouth at 14, and sticking all kinds of shit in your pussy, and, you know, that, that, like, upset him.  Well, I don't know why it would upset him, because he already knew I was going to say it.  He knew that's what I was going to open with, and he knew some of the stories that I was going to... 
[04:02:00]  Yeah, but he probably thought they were, like, cute.  He started not so graphic, maybe.  Not so graphic, and not talking that you were 14 at the time.  He was just flat-out disgusted.  So he's just picturing the little 14-year-old girl he loves taking a mouthful of fucking cum.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, which, by the way, is beautiful.  Of course.  You're old for my taste.  Better start if you're 11.  A white guy?  No, no, no, it was a black guy.  Black guy came in your mouth? 
[04:02:30]  Yeah, it was the only one.  I can't talk to you again, and you're never kissing me on the cheek when you come in.  It was the only time, Anthony.  It was an accident.  No more black cock.  You hear me?  Yeah, yeah, hey.  Yeah?  Yes, Anthony.  All right, hold on.  Hold on a line.  I want to play the third track.  So she goes right to the calls, like, whatever.  I'm moving on with my show, and Danny interrupts to see what the fuck just happened.  Hey, Danny's funny.  Hey, Francine, before you take another call, I thought that we would need to bring it to 
[04:03:00]  the audience's attention that your co-host up and left.  Oh, I forgot.  Yeah.  Why did you bring a guy that was going to walk out on you because of your show?  Well, here's the thing.  I don't know why he left.  Well, I do.  He said that he didn't know that the show was going to be all about sex, because this  isn't what you guys went over.  Okay.  Well, the thing is, I outlined it, and I gave it to him, and that's pretty much what 
[04:03:30]  I did.  So he should know, like, some of the stuff I was going to talk about.  Do you guys want to discuss it some more?  Oh, yeah.  My co-host left you guys.  I forgot.  That's because I wasn't even thinking about it.  There you go.  She is fucking hysterical.  And how did you outline that, Francine?  I would love to read this outline.  Oh, yeah.  One, things I put in my cunt, commercial break, rejoiner, things I put in my asshole, pay 
[04:04:00]  calls.  Pay calls.  14 years old, guy came in my mouth, co-host leaves.  Excuse me, she put 14, Y-R-S, and then parentheses, mouth cum.  Hey, Francine.  Yes, Anthony?  Now, this guy, obviously he was pissed off that he didn't know this show was going to  be so sexual, what he said.  What did he expect, and what type of guy is he, like, what would he contribute to a radio 
[04:04:30]  show?  What did he want to do?  Well, I don't know.  Well, he gave me a couple of CDs, and I listened to them.  They weren't so bad.  I think it was musical stuff that he'd come up with.  So he wanted to cover music, or what's that?  He wanted to play his own bits.  Do we have them?  He wanted to play his own fucking comedy bits off a CD?  Yeah.  Do we have them?  On a radio show?  While she's talking about shit, she's fucking putting up her pussy? 
[04:05:00]  Is he insane?  Swallowing cum, and I just, I overheard them in the office prepping, and he was like, so  do you think we'll have time for my rap song?  Oh, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  Is he a white guy?  I feel sorry for Danny.  He has to put this shit together every weekend.  Francine, white guy or black guy?  He's white.  White guy.  Where's the, excuse me, where's the rap song?  We need his material.  I think he took it, actually.  I think he took it back.  Oh, my God.  Francine, do you have it? 
[04:05:30]  I could ask him for it.  Ask him for it.  Where can we get it immediately?  What's his name?  His name's Anthony Papandreas, but I have to, I have to get in contact with him.  I'm pretty sure he'd be more than happy to let you guys play it.  Well, we would actually give it a fair shot.  You were sure he'd be more than happy to be your co-host, too, you fucking lunatic?  Yeah.  Well, he's, he also, like, the thing is, we also, I also did the news.  Yeah.  And we talked about some other topics besides that, but, I mean, like, there wasn't much 
[04:06:00]  that he was saying, so I had nothing to go with, so I had to move on.  So the good stuff.  Goddamn, see, Francine, no.  Yeah, there you go.  It's like, you go to the news, you do a little stuff, you see, and then you go, all right,  now we know where to hit these guys between the eyes.  Francine, I think you get another shot.  Yeah.  I want you to, I want you to come in with an outline for your next show so we can go  over with it, go over it with you.  See, Francine.  And we're going to hone in and make sure you're really, really focused for the next one.  See, Francine's a woman you can have on the radio who's not a whole, because she's 
[04:06:30]  honest and funny and just a fucking perv and she doesn't give a shit, this is not what  we're talking about when we're talking about a whole.  Yeah.  Yeah, so I don't feel, you know, you get plenty of funny women on the phone, on the radio.  Yeah.  What a great Martin Luther King Day we've had today.  We have Francine talking about her radio show and stuff up her pussy and being 14 years  old and having a black man come in her mouth.  That is right there enough for MLK Day. 
[04:07:00]  But that wasn't enough.  We had the guy, the gay guy from The Apprentice, who was also black, come on the show and just  be lambasted by Opie about his homosexuality.  What?  Faggot.  And be called a faggot.  What about you guys on that one?  I was just asking sexy questions.  Of course, me and Jimmy jumped in, but, you know, you always remember who threw out that  first pitch.  Well, yeah.  And then we were talking about a giant gay black gentleman that wanted to stick two fingers 
[04:07:30]  up Steve's ass, slowly open it up so his whole fist would slide in.  Do a little swirly.  Swirly.  That was wonderful.  We have had a very Afrocentric show today.  Hell, yeah.  Congratulations to you guys.  Yeah, and it's all for Martin Luther King.  That's cool.  All right.  So, Francine, we're going to give you another shot, but we want to see your outline for  the next show, okay?  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Hey, and by the way, we told the Pest that they could get some airtime on this channel. 
[04:08:00]  Yeah.  We absolutely said that at the end of last year.  And Norton's tool, I think he's writing every day at this point, you guys need to  cut the shit and give the Pest, like, No Filter, Paul, Denise, and Big A their show  you promised them months ago.  Yeah, dickbag.  How about when they fucking come up with an idea?  We're not just going to throw people on the air to go, what do you want to talk about?  It's simple as this.  You're a pest.  We're going to give you airtime.  You just got to come up with a good idea.  Come up with an idea. 
[04:08:30]  As soon as you get an idea where we go, wow, that would be interesting or cool, you're  on the air.  If you can't come up with an idea, you're not going to be able to come up with material  on the air.  So just come up with a fucking idea.  So I'm waiting for No Filter, Paul, to come up with his idea.  Who's that asshole?  What's his name?  Norton's tool.  Norton's tool from where?  New York.  Doesn't say, like, a whack bag?  No.  It's probably No Filter, Paul himself.  Yeah, it probably is.  Fucking limey.  So that's the deal with the pests out there.  You come up with an idea for a radio show, we're going to give you airtime. 
[04:09:00]  All right?  All right.  Norton's tool.  I think I've seen him on whack bag.  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  I might pull a few strings.  You're not going to see him no more.  You won't see him no more.  All right.  It's time for the line of the day.  Sausage.  Wine.  So, DeeDee.  Sugar.  That's my trick.  Danny, thumbs up or down with DeeDee?  DeeDee stinks.  Will you have to get some audio with that?  Will you have to get some audio with it?  I'll get you some for tomorrow.  Sure.  Yeah, we got to hear a little of what's going on here on Saturday.  Email DeeDee.  Over the weekend, whatever.  And say she's got to defend herself and ask her for like a minute or two minutes of 
[04:09:30]  her show she thought was good.  And we'll critique it tomorrow.  Will do.  So, it's up to her.  I will.  Whatever part she thought's smart.  Francine, hard act to follow.  Wow.  It looks like DeeDee's out and Francine's in.  Who was on first?  DeeDee?  Yeah, DeeDee was first.  Francine had the last hour.  That was smart.  I got to tell you, it's kind of brilliant to start the show with things I've had up  my pussy.  Who's tuning out?  You're tuning in this weird new show you don't know what to expect and she started that? 
[04:10:00]  That's her opener?  That's the opener.  You're not going anywhere.  Do you understand?  If you started congressional meetings like that, everyone would watch them.  Yeah.  If the president would start his speech, the ratings would be up.  That's it.  Fucking C-SPAN would be the hottest channel on cable.  Right.  Fucking who's that broad that just won the big thing?  The fucking house speaker now?  Diane Pelosi?  Nancy Pelosi.  Nancy Pelosi.  If she's talking about things she's stuck in a cunt, who wouldn't watch her every week?  The gavel.  Yeah.  This very gavel. 
[04:10:30]  Gavel end first.  Oh.  She could talk about fucking coal mining machinery after that and people will fucking stay till  the end.  Because I want to know if she put something up front in her box.  One of those fucking helmets with the lamps on it.  Or if, you know, like, that's just how she would tease these things like, you never know,  something might have fallen off the mining truck into my pussy.  Right.  Or maybe that's what the miners were trapped in and didn't know it.  There was six of them in the well of my uterus. 
[04:11:00]  One shoved a piece of coal up my ass trying to make a diamond.  Time for line of the day?  Sure.  We got a couple runner-ups.  Bowdogfight.com sponsors line of the day.  Here's the first runner-up.  What song would you consider to be your theme song?  Taps!  Because we kill listeners.  There you go.  Very good.  Dee Dee was good.  Oh, yeah?  I'm distracted.  Pete?  Yeah, hey. 
[04:11:30]  How you doing, boys?  I was in both shows.  Both shows, Francine's and Dee Dee's, from Saturday night.  Dee Dee did okay, except for all the pests who were destroying her.  But Francine stunk.  She was horrid.  How do you say that stunk?  And she was so all over the place, she couldn't keep her mind on one thing,  and she kept hanging up on the collars in the middle of what the collars were trying to fucking say.  You didn't like things I've had up my pussy?  Oh, no.  That part was good. 
[04:12:00]  All right.  What did Dee Dee do?  Hold on.  Hold on.  What did Dee Dee do that was so good?  We need examples.  I mean, you're just making an opinion, which is fine, but you've got to back it up.  What did Dee Dee do that you thought was good?  Okay, Dee Dee's co-host went out and found this opera girl chick.  She was pretty good.  She was pretty sexy.  What did the opera chick do?  Opera girl?  Yeah, they found this opera girl who sang pretty good, and she talked a little bit dirty.  And then you had Dee Dee, who kept promising to like Bob Kelly's asshole. 
[04:12:30]  But Dee Dee's co-host stunk besides that.  Danny?  She was...  Hold on.  Shut up.  Hold on, Pete.  She had no...  She was completely unprepared, so they thought that what they would do was go out on the  street ten minutes before it was showtime and just pick a random stranger up off the  street, and they would sit in as a guest.  Oh, boy.  So they brought some chick who happened to be on an interview for an opera.  Pretty good idea.  Could have worked.  Could have, but...  No.  I mean...  Who was Dee Dee's co-host? 
[04:13:00]  Some...  Another terrible comic.  Yeah, some guy named Dion.  Dion.  Dion.  Yeah, the black guy.  Dion.  Dion who?  I have no idea.  Where's Dee Dee today?  Where can't we get her on the line?  Your son.  All right, Pete.  Thanks.  All right, thanks, guys.  We'll figure it out.  All right, Dee's second runner-up line of the day, sponsored by BodogFight.com.  Before we play Star Casino, stroll around the world, speaking of faggots...  Oh, hey.  Speaking of faggots, we got Cary on the phone. 
[04:13:30]  He was voted off The Apprentice last night.  All right.  Truly uncomfortable.  All right.  Yeah.  We got it.  All right.  Truly uncomfortable.  Yeah, that was it.  BodogFight.com sponsors Line of the Day.  Here is today's winner.  Here comes Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Which Cardoon character can you relate to and why? 
[04:14:00]  Pepe Le Pew, because I'm a rapist.  Yeah, very good.  Jimmy's Line, as read by me.  By Anthony Cumia.  Very funny.  You have to split that 50-50.  I like Jimmy's Line.  It's so well delivered.  Very funny. 
[04:14:30]  However.  Sit on your ass.  It's Martin Luther King Day.  That's not what it's about.  What?  People are saying how they're celebrating Martin Luther King Day.  Just sitting on their ass.  Boy.  Just stop.  That's not nice.  It's really not nice.  Can we go home now?  Yeah.  We have to end the show because I have to talk to open air privately.  Right now I'm puckering my lips and they're dry like an asshole.  And I'm rubbing my fingers around and it feels cool. 
[04:15:00]  Put two fingers in and make circles with them.  Do you know how awful Steve's ass must be to finger?  Any guy's ass would be awful.  But do you know Steve does not have good asshole hygiene?  He might try to.  I have never even thought about it.  Think about it now.  In depth.  No.  He can't wipe too deep.  He has those dumb rings on.  We had enough trouble thinking about Bob Kelly sucking Frank Vincent's cock.  Oh I forgot about that. 
[04:15:30]  Frank Vincent was in.  We were having a great time.  He was good.  What a blast.  He was a trooper.  The first time he was in kind of you know getting to know you little thing.  It was kind of just fun.  Yeah it was fun.  It was really cool.  But he came in here and just we had a great fucking time with him.  He really you know loosened up and Bob Kelly's here and they're talking and apparently after  the show Frank Vincent and Bob Kelly were talking about maybe Frank coming down and  seeing one of Bob's shows.  So Bob was writing something down and and I mentioned and this is off the air I mentioned 
[04:16:00]  wow that's kind of cool you know Frank Vincent come down and see you you know that that'd be  great and he goes yeah and then out of nowhere he goes I could see you guys like coming down  and you know coming down to check the show out and you go into this back closet or room  somewhere and I'm just sucking Frank Vincent's cock.  Out of nowhere I'm just like Bobby where did that come from?  He goes I don't know I just you know I think how much you guys would freak out if you know 
[04:16:30]  it's Frank Vincent and I'm just like sucking his cock.  And we're like you wouldn't we wouldn't we wouldn't think you're gay because you're  obviously trying to get rid of some horrible shit that happened to you when you were younger  and you know it's Frank Vincent dude you know I fucking suck his dick dude just like came out  of nowhere and then I couldn't get the picture out of my head just Frank Vincent now go and get  your fucking shine box there's Bob Kelly he'd probably talk soft to him he'd probably have his 
[04:17:00]  hand he'd probably talk soft and I know the closet Bob beans I know exactly what he means oh yeah  yeah it does exist in the cell and he'd probably probably be on his fucking knees with his fucking  fat pants pull down around his ankle on the basement floor sitting holding his balls Frank would have his  about Bob's head cradling it gently fucking Bob's throat  and he'd be talking softly like you know Frank Vincent's voice he'd probably be going atta boy  atta boy I don't know how Frank sounds soft yeah yeah kiss it a little he'd say kiss it a little 
[04:17:30]  and then we had the uh Frank Vincent uh delivering Steve's lines that's terrific which was  unbelievable you realize what an actor let's replay Frank Vincent is great when he was doing uh with  Bob the scene that Steve was doing when uh when he was doing these lines what are you doing in my  house how'd your parents die why not that that's terrible I'm sorry you know all those lines Frank 
[04:18:00]  Vincent was doing them and like you're like that's fucking that's the way to do it that's the way to  do it we'll get that for tomorrow tell Frank we want Pesci in here too maybe they'll come in  together and all yeah laughs we kind of try a lot throw a few laughs around we got a cute uh Francine  story as we uh say goodbye today oh I love this one I saw it I saw the uh the Sharpie writing we  haven't played this in a long time yeah unless they play it on a best of I don't fucking know horrific  all right so here it is uh we leave you with uh another fine little story from 
[04:18:30]  Francine you had an abortion Francine well guess what fellas I almost had to have an abortion  instead you had a baby  I was 17 and I had a boyfriend and we were having sex without condoms  always smart yeah not not the greatest idea but I think he didn't have any money and neither did I 
[04:19:00]  to have to like buy any so we just did it without it so I got pregnant congratulations everybody thank  you guys and I was really scared and I was like I don't really know what to do and this is terrible  but um there was a flight of stairs no no here's here's the other problem right I didn't really  know if he was the dad because I had also had sex with like another guy that month right 
[04:19:30]  but I believe he was only because they told me it was about three months that I was pregnant when I  went to the hospital he was the last guy I had it was between two guys so I figured out it was him  probably so you are the father so he was definitely the one that did it right plus the other guy was  like I'm like infertile what's that mean I think like evil something where you can't have kids  infertile sterile sterile he was like so um I was at the dentist you think maybe um that guy might 
[04:20:00]  have just said he was sterile so he would never have to deal with any responsibility with impregnating  you well I don't think I would have had the baby in the first place all right I'm sorry I didn't  mean to interrupt your story so fellas this is what happened I told my girlfriends I didn't tell my mom  to like I think last year I was like chickies listen to me because I had three chickie friends 
[04:20:30]  I was like I think I'm pregnant and they're like chickies at the nursing place said I'm pregnant  three months and I was like I really can't have a baby I don't have any money so I figured they were  like we're all gonna like pool together and give me some abortion money right because I I was like I  had no money and I was working at Burger King and I was like I was like in 11th grade I'll put some  money together and make over your uterus and I I had the scar tissue removed yeah and I had I had braces 
[04:21:00]  so like I was paying for my own braces at the time so I was like I have to pay how fucking hot is that  because my teeth were atrocious like I said before they were really bad so you worked at Burger King to  raise the money for the yeah actually I did no I didn't raise the money I was already I was paying off  like a three thousand dollar braces bill wow right plus I had to have oral surgery to move some teeth 
[04:21:30]  that were already inside my mouth my mouth was fucked up so I could just grab the baby while he was in  there no I wish I wish I could have done that but um I'm at the dentist's office I'm doing like a dental  thingy and I think it was a cleaning not an orthopedic what because that's for your teeth and  I like felt blood coming out so I was like I wonder what this is so I called my girlfriend  this story gets funnier and funnier and she was like I was like listen I got blood coming out my 
[04:22:00]  vagina and I'm pregnant so this shouldn't be my period so she was like well I don't know what to do  so what I did was I was like well maybe I'm having my period anyway so I jammed a tampon up my crotch  and I called another chick and she was like oh my god are you crazy take that tampon out of your  crotch and just go to the bathroom so I went to the bathroom took out the tampon and voila all this  red shit came out it was the baby oh man you're covering up so much pain with that 
[04:22:30]  oh my god and the baby came out to the toilet a cheaper boy giving out cigars that say it's a blob  it was red shit it was nothing about big old pile of shit just came out and I was like yay  and the first thing is she's not even phased she just goes free abortion I was like I don't need any
