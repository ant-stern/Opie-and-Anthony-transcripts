<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Kid Rock and Pam Anderson, quickly transitioning to a debate about Ben, the show's music director, playing reggae music. Listener feedback on Ben's reggae selection was mixed.  Calls from Cheryl and Prudence praised Ben's music choices, escalating into suggestive and offensive banter using Jamaican stereotypes and sexual references.  Further calls from Jamaican listeners Natty and J.R. followed, discussing Jamaican culture and stereotypes, and the possibility of a Jamaican-themed party at the studio.  The hosts also discussed an upcoming promotional segment for CBS TV.

Kimmy, a *Survivor* contestant, arrived late to the studio and discussed her experience on the show and the hostsâ€™ on-air commentary about her, including her participation in the show's whipped cream bikini contest, with a bet placed on her participation.  Sponsors, including Sam Adams beer and whippedcreambikini.com, were mentioned. Comedian Christopher Titus called in, commenting on the show's format.  Further discussion included the upcoming Stone Temple Pilots album release, and more calls from J.R. attempting to dispel stereotypes about Jamaicans. Devin Ratray (Buzz McCallister from *Home Alone*) also called in, confirming he listened to the show and discussed his career. The whipped cream bikini contest continued to be promoted.

The show continued with a call from "Cakes," who described her boyfriend's negative reaction to her participation in a whipped cream bikini contest and other on-air dares.  A promo for "Pinnacle Monkeying Around" was aired. Kimmy from *Survivor* was in studio, promising to wear a whipped cream bikini the next day.  Jason recounted winning $125,000 on *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire*, mimicking his celebratory call. A prank call tricked a listener into thinking he'd won $100,000, only to reveal he'd won a candy bar.  Numerous purported celebrity callers followed, including (dubious) calls from Devin Ratray, someone claiming to be Jimmy Kittner from *Jaws*, and Frederick Kohler (Chip from *Kate & Allie*), who eventually arrived at the studio. Many other claimed celebrity callers were unverified.  Several female callers expressed interest in the whipped cream bikini contest.  Jen called seeking help finding a woman, prompting discussion about bras and body image. The hosts repeatedly mentioned uploading the day's "dump sheet" to their website.  Vulgar and sexually explicit language was frequent throughout.

A further segment featured more prank calls from people claiming to be celebrities, including Buzz from *Home Alone* (discussing Macaulay Culkin's apartment), actors from *Who's the Boss?* and *Married...with Children*, and Mr. Met. The hosts expressed frustration with the lack of whipped cream bikini contest participants.  The discussion remained highly sexually charged and included graphic descriptions and innuendo, with vulgar and offensive humor targeting race, sexuality, and physical appearance.  Robert Downey Jr.'s legal troubles were referenced.  A caller claimed to have been an extra in a *Sopranos* blowjob scene.  The segment concluded with advertisements for TheOnlineCasino.com and Monkeygrams, with more sexually suggestive jokes during the ad reads.

The show continued with a Hawaii trip contest announcement, mentions of Sam Adams beer and a song described as containing "crap" and "blood."  New message board screen names were introduced, including variations of "Pudge Smacker" and "Pudge Whacker." The possibility of a segment featuring a chef preparing unappetizing food was discussed.  Macaulay Culkin was insulted with homophobic and ableist slurs.  Buzz from *Home Alone* was invited to a "Celebrity Bikini Softball Game" (with clarification that previous games had less-than-bikini-clad participants), mentioning past participants like Shirley Hemphill, Barry Williams, and Jay Mohr.  Numerous callers phoned in, with comedic bits including a Greaseman impression and discussions of his career and past controversies, speculation about his image rehabilitation efforts, and racially charged comments.  Other callers made offensive jokes involving Ed Norton, O.J. Simpson, Mike Tyson, and other celebrities.  The *Sopranos*, Uncle Junior, and Tony Soprano were discussed. The "What Did We Learn?" segment followed, with listener-submitted humorous and offensive observations, including additional insults towards Macaulay Culkin and Ed Norton.  Promotions for Planet Java iced coffee and the whipped cream bikini contest were aired, followed by more offensive jokes and remarks from callers. The final portion included discussion of an upcoming show featuring Rodney Dangerfield and Kimmy from *Survivor*, ending with more listener calls and banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the ONA Show, gotta get right into it today.  Yes. Look at that. Ben's playing some Kid Rock. I saw that. I heard it. You read the paper today, Kid Rock, playing with Pam Anderson in Detroit? What's going on there? 
[00:00:30]  You think Kid Rock is fouling that body? That's been fouled already. And I don't know. I wouldn't want to be second up to bat behind Tommy Lee.  That's something to live up to. That's tough, right? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  And then Ben's playing a little reggae mod. What was that about, Ben?  I heard that. It wasn't a song. I'm not heavily into reggae, so I'm like, I know the white guy's reggae.  Well, you know, it's funny because Ope's criticized me on that. When I worked in Rock Radio way back when, that was a big song.  Wively up your head.  Wait a minute.  Oh, wait a minute.  What was that?  Oh, my God. He's going to get out of here.  I didn't even mean to come across like that, but he's like, what is this?  He's going to be demanding 12 minutes soon. Instead of the eight we give him. 
[00:01:30]  12 minutes.  When I was working at Rock Radio.  Lively up yourself from Naughty Dreads. That's a great song. Mark called it. Remember when we used to play this song at PCS?  A bunch of people appreciating this song, Ben. Don't worry about it.  It's a great song.  But you were reading the instant feedback.  Well, you want to know what it was?  It's funny. He was reading the instant feedback because he wanted to see how many people were digging the tune.  And, like, one person's like, man, Ben, I just want to be the first to say your tunes were great today.  What the hell is going on? Is Stinky picking the tunes today?  You know what the thing is, to be realistic? Stinky kept saying to me, when are you going to play some reggae? 
[00:02:00]  I said, once the weather gets warm, I'll play some reggae.  I don't, you know.  Okay, well, it's good. Today's 85 degrees. I'm like, I'll play Bob Mars. There you go.  Hey, here's Cheryl. The last bastion of Freeform Radio. Ben. Ben. Ben with the crowd.  Cheryl enjoyed the tune. Cheryl.  I did.  Cheryl.  Hello.  Call me now for your free reading.  Hello. I just want to let you guys know that Ben made my day.  Made your day. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, and he should get a raise.  He should get a raise.  A raise.  Well, great. We're number one with Rasta Mamas.  Because the sun is hot. The day is hot.  Yeah.  And I just pulled out the card of cups.  The day is hot, and I just want to say good going, Ben.  Good going.  Yeah.  You don't do that card reading, though, huh?  No, I don't.  Nothing. Say it, please. Could you just say, call me now?  Guys, no, it sounds stupid.  Say it, please.  Is she the same one that calls? I don't even know.  Yes.  I love it. 
[00:03:00]  Okay.  Say it, Cheryl, please.  Okay, here it goes.  Call me now.  She's the chick.  You're that chick from TV.  No, I'm not.  Cheryl, what do you do?  I'm a babysitter.  You're a babysitter for a profession, huh?  Yeah.  You don't smack the kid on the head with a wooden spoon.  No, I wouldn't.  Yeah, watch out.  There's cameras all over the place.  Babysitter can't even smack kids over the head with wooden spoons.  So what happened?  You just didn't feel like trying in school?  Huh?  Oh, jeez. 
[00:03:30]  They're awful, man.  Listen, being a babysitter is a good job.  Because when somebody leaves their baby in your hands, they're leaving their entire life in your hands.  Cheryl, you make a good living with that babysitting?  Yeah.  How many babies do you sit?  One.  That's it, huh?  Exclusive.  Nice.  So you've got to expand.  You've got to get like a franchise out there.  Cheryl, the Jamaican woman babysitting service.  Come up with some name, you know?  We're great babysitters.  How many kids have you shaken to death? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, no.  Stop.  That's a Boston thing.  They're awful.  Cheryl, when are you coming in so we can check you out?  You call us a lot.  I let you know.  Yeah?  And you're letting everyone know in the community that Opie and Anthony are doing the thing or what?  I let them know.  We could use a few more Jamaicans listening to this show.  A whole lot of Jamaicans in the Bronx listening to your show.  I mean, what can we do to embrace the Jamaicans? 
[00:04:30]  What else?  A little reggae helps, right?  Today was a good start with that song that Ben played.  A blunt airdrop, Opie.  We'll fly over and just drop blunts out of a bomber plane.  Would that help?  No.  No?  No.  Well, what can we do?  As I said, today was a good start with Ben.  With Ben.  Okay.  Yeah.  Just follow that up and we'll continue listening to this show.  Hold on.  There's a little competition going on here, Cheryl.  Prudence says she can do the Call Me Now line better.  Prudence.  Hi.  Hi.  Yes.  She don't do it good. 
[00:05:00]  Are you Jamaican too?  Yes, I am.  Big up, Ben.  That was good.  Big up, Ben.  Big up, Ben.  Ben gets a big up.  Is Ben a botty boy?  No.  No, he's not.  I hope not.  No, he's not.  A blood clot?  Is Ben a blood clot?  See, we do know some stuff to make the Jamaicans laugh out there.  It's probably no.  Wait, how do you know Ben's not a botty boy?  Botty boy.  Yeah, botty boy.  Botty boy. 
[00:05:30]  Botty boy.  But both of you said, no, no, no, Ben is definitely not a botty boy.  No, he's not.  How do you know?  Because he likes girls.  Well, there you go.  See?  Botty boy is...  Homosexual.  All right.  Hey, Prudence.  Yes.  Let me hear you call me now.  Call me now.  Hey, that's pretty good.  Cheryl?  I don't like that lady.  I don't really want to do it.  I don't like that lady.  You know that lady's not Jamaican.  No, she's from, like, America.  She's not out of Brooklyn.  But she's playing the Jamaican angle. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, occasionally.  And I hate that.  Occasionally, it drops out.  Hey, Ben.  Oh, you should be looking at yourself instead of looking at that guy you're with.  Yeah, hey, Ben.  What happened there?  Ben.  Uh, Ben.  Ben.  Call me now.  Oh, hey.  A little Jamaican love going on?  You have a Jamaican chick there, Ben?  No, huh?  What kind of stuff?  Grab her by the dredge?  You guys keep her well-groomed or what?  The Jamaicans.  Yes, we do.  Actually, man, we look.  No, it's like Bob Marley's head is in a leg lock. 
[00:06:30]  It's hard with sore hair.  Down there.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, what do Rasta women do?  Do they make that, you know, well, you know what I'm saying, Ann?  I mean...  They keep their knees off, so they cut it roto.  It looks like someone threw a conch fritter on the barbershop floor.  Squash.  Look at you updating your jokes.  Geography dictates.  Uh-uh.  Very nice.  Okay, bye, guys.  All right, who's saying bye, Cheryl or Pruitt?  Yes, Cheryl.  Cheryl.  Bye-bye, Cheryl.  Hey, I'm going to talk.  Hey, Jamaican Mike, hi for me.  Oh, yes.  What happened to Jamaican Mike? 
[00:07:00]  Um, he's only here when, like, there's naked chicks and stuff, so...  Oh, okay.  He could skewer both of you like so much jerk chicken.  Okay.  On a kebab.  Are you coming down for our whipped cream bikini contest?  Me?  I'm a little shy.  We could use a Jamaican in the contest.  Oh, no, I can't, I can't.  No?  I'm too skinny for you guys.  Too skinny?  Yes.  How skinny skinny?  Yeah.  106.  And how tall?  5'4".  That's nice.  5'4", 106.  That's good.  It's not the Jamaican guys.  No, see, now, see, there's the paradox. 
[00:07:30]  For Jamaican guys, that's not good.  I would date only American men or white men like my look.  Right, because they want a little bit more booty than you got.  Much more booty than I got.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a shame.  You walk around the community and they laugh at your skinny chicken ass, right?  Yeah.  Oh.  Get yourself an Oscar.  I need some porridge.  Come down here and we'll check out your ass.  I'll try.  I'll do it.  No, I'm serious.  Come on down.  We don't care what you look like. 
[00:08:00]  We like making new friends.  Okay.  All right, Prudence.  Bye-bye.  You come see us soon.  All right.  Well, 59th and 5th?  You're off a couple blocks each way.  57th and 7th.  57th and 7th.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Big up.  Big up.  Big up.  Yeah.  Big up to Ben.  Ben, making the Jamaicans happy.  That's cool.  That's good.  See?  That's how we're going to win in this city.  Right.  We were looking to maybe pull in some more of the urban numbers, Opie, that we were lacking. 
[00:08:30]  All right.  All right.  And that's the way to do it.  Big up.  Kind of strange to do a radio show today.  We got a camera crew in.  Yes.  And lights.  I have sunglasses on.  It's so bright in here.  It's like you see Close Encounters.  You see Close Encounters when the ship finally opened up and that big, long-armed creature came out.  Yeah.  That's what I feel like.  That's what that light looks like.  It's very bright in here today.  We're not used to this.  By the way, we're not wearing sunglasses for you.  No.  That would be silly.  Sunglasses in the studio. 
[00:09:00]  That's very silly.  Although the lights aren't bright enough.  I could use some suntan lotion, but...  Yeah.  So what are we doing?  We're like filming stuff for CBS TV, their morning show, right?  April.  Yeah.  Come on.  Promote.  You're on.  You're the one that put this together, right?  Sort of?  Yes.  All right.  Want to explain to our listeners?  This is like...  What's wrong?  I can't hear you, my friend.  Oh.  Know what she looks like?  You know when you go in for the hearing test and you have to point at one ear to the ear?  This side, I think. 
[00:09:30]  Thanks.  Yes.  You got it now?  Yes.  All right.  Why the camera crews?  Why the bright lights?  Why the director in the corner that is studying our every move?  All right.  This is what we're going to do starting Wednesday morning on CBS TV between 6A and 7A.  They're going to run an Opie and Anthony clip.  Mm-hmm.  And that clip will direct people to listen to you guys later this afternoon.  All right.  This afternoon.  We're going to do that and give people chances to go to L.A.  Mm-hmm.  To see Brian Gumbel in the town hall meeting right after the final Survivor. 
[00:10:00]  All the Survivors are going to be there from the second episode.  So it's going to be cool.  It's an only opportunity for you two.  So a couple of our listeners will definitely be going to L.A. for the final Survivor show.  Because that's when they're going to pick the winner.  So technically it's the final Survivor show.  Exactly.  Look at that, Anthony.  See, they finally did it where no one can possibly know who wins.  See?  Right.  God.  So who do you think wins?  Who do I think?  April.  Yeah.  I want the million.  I think everybody thinks Kobe's going to win, but I don't want him to win. 
[00:10:30]  Tina.  I want Elizabeth.  We all want Elizabeth.  Who doesn't?  Well, we want her to win.  I don't care who you want.  Oh, win.  Yeah, we want her to win, too.  So you're pretty good.  Thank you.  So we're like filming these, I think they're called vignettes, Anthony.  Vignettes?  Little, would you say, the director guy, would you say it's like a vignette?  Sounds good to me.  Sounds good, right?  A quick, you know, few seconds.  We're going to have some big announcer voice going, blah, blah, blah.  And now take a look at the Opie and Anthony clip and we do something really, really ridiculous. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  Bordering on Wacky.  We've been having some creative differences with the fine folks in the studio.  Creative differences.  But we're working it out.  Are we difficult to work with?  Well, the problem is April has the sick mind.  And I had to tell her to calm down.  I know.  I get right.  We can't do that with the boomerang and the blow-up sheep.  Yeah.  April's like, why not?  Can I tell you guys something?  You're listening to something?  Yeah.  Everybody, they see you on the website, your pictures of both of you? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  But you guys are so much better looking in person.  Oh, look at that.  Wow, look at that.  See, thank you.  There it is.  Do we have to pay you for that?  I'm not talking to you, Opie.  You're not talking to Anthony.  Oh.  Oh, no.  I'm only kidding.  I'm talking to both of you.  Oh.  No, why?  We like showered and cleaned up because we knew you'd have to be coming in.  You both look very handsome.  Most of the shots on the website is us just not showered, hungover.  We don't care.  That's like a usual day.  Right.  See, we cleaned up like Kimmy did.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  Exactly.  Whoa, what a tie-in there. 
[00:12:00]  We learned from Kimmy.  Kimmy looked pretty ratty on Survivor.  Well, if we're going to be on TV again, I don't know why anyone else has given us a  chance to do anything on TV, but we should be clean and showered and stuff.  Right.  Yeah.  So there you have it.  So we cleaned up.  So we filmed like three vignettes so far, and we're looking for three more.  Yeah.  And we're waiting for Kimmy to come in here so she could be involved in this.  Right.  You know, she was on the show, but Rick said she left her house on Long Island at like  1.30 to be here at 2.  1.30?  1.30.  Why would you leave Long Island at 1.30 to be in the city by 2? 
[00:12:30]  Dude, it's Kimmy.  She forgot about traffic from Long Island.  All right.  Natty.  You.  You're Jamaican.  Yeah, man.  All right.  What's going on?  Yeah, I just hear you guys big enough Jamaica today, so I'll say I'll call and show some  respect, you know?  Let's back up a little bit.  How did Natty find out about the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, my virgin that I work with, Tommy.  Big up Tommy.  I'm big up on my virgin.  A lot of big ups.  A lot of big ups going on.  He listens to you guys every day.  Got his wow sticker and everything.  So Tommy goes, hey, Natty, you got to check out these guys? 
[00:13:00]  Well, I mean, I came in.  I had no choice.  I had to just join him.  I couldn't beat him.  And then what got you hooked on our show?  Because we're not used to hearing that Jamaicans are listening to our radio program.  Now, when you say Jamaicans, you know, we can't adapt to anything and any situation.  But was there a particular bit where you finally said, oh, my God, I got to listen to these  guys?  No, sometimes you guys are funny.  Sometimes you guys are very annoying.  And sometimes.  No, but it's the truth.  You know, when I look at all, when I really take it in perspective, it's entertainment. 
[00:13:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  So I don't hold up against you guys, man.  All right, cool.  You guys have good entertainment.  But what I want to say is, won't you guys promote a reggae party or something?  A reggae party?  Yeah.  I hear you playing Bob Marley every now and then, you know?  Well, Psycho Mark just went down to Jamaica for, like, what did he do?  Spring Bay.  Spring Bay.  Yeah, but that ain't doing me no good here.  That's what happened to Psycho Mark down there.  Oh, you want to come to a party or something?  Yeah, let's go for a party.  We should have a Jamaican party right in the studio. 
[00:14:00]  That would be pretty good.  You guys, yeah.  That would rock.  Anthony and I will be the only white guys.  I'll be trying to say teen Jamaican party.  Teen Jamaican party.  Yeah.  Of course, everything sounds a little better when you put the word teen in front of it.  Natty, you know any teenagers that would come down here?  You know, we meet 18, 19.  Yeah, man.  I know lots of them.  Jamaican teenagers?  Jamaicans, teenagers, everyone.  That's got to be pretty good.  I like it.  All right, Natty. 
[00:14:30]  Well, respect.  Keep up your work.  Yes, sir.  All right, we're trying.  All right.  Big up, Natty.  Peace.  Yeah, look at each other.  See, we can learn from each other.  Peace.  So, what white guys do?  Peace.  Peace out.  J.R., what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  This is J.R.  I'm from the Bronx, and I'm also Jamaican.  I don't have an accent, though.  Well, yeah.  But I can't use it, you guys.  I mean, use it in front of the parents.  But, you know, usually when I talk in front of my friends, I just talk normal.  And you use it to pick up girls, don't you?  Hey, no doubt. 
[00:15:00]  No doubt.  But what I was calling is because I want to dispel some of the myths that they have about  Jamaicans.  Okay.  Like, one is that all Jamaicans like smoking weed.  Not true.  No?  Not true.  Some of us don't.  Yeah, but aren't stereotypes fun?  Yeah, they are.  You have to think they are fun.  But old Jamaican guys, me personally, I like girls with nice rear ends, but not fat girls.  Yeah.  Right.  Like any girl with a nice, round bubble butt.  You know, that other girl, though, was very skinny. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  But it still sounds good anyway.  And there's also a myth that Jamaican guys don't like to, let me see, make the ice cream cone,  if you know what I'm saying.  Eat the cooch.  Right.  But that's not true either.  Oh, really?  That's right.  I hear in general black guys don't like that.  I don't know who told you that.  That's what I've heard.  You heard it from the wrong person.  Or should I say Martians?  Martians don't like to, uh...  Oh.  No, really.  That is a stereotype, and I'm not sure how true it is. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, I guess you've got to ask the girls, not the guys.  Exactly.  Well, I know I've never had no complaints, so...  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, when you watch a lot of porno, you learn a lot of things, so...  You know, you want to indulge and try it, and hey, if it sets the females off, hey, go for it.  Thank God for porno, Opie.  Right on.  Thank God for it.  Right on.  All right, J.R.  Thank you.  One more thing.  Yes.  That idea about the Jamaican teen party, excellent.  Please, let me get some information.  I would love to come.  Well, you'll know if we do it. 
[00:16:30]  Okay.  Just keep listening to the show.  We've got to figure it out.  I listen every day.  Because if we're going to have a Jamaican party, we're going to have a Jamaican party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Complete with...  Psycho Mark will have to come in with some herbals.  Herbal supplements.  Yeah.  All right, J.R.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  I think maybe we're making headway here in the Jamaican community.  1027 WNNW.  Will, you're next.  What's up?  What's up?  How you doing, O'Hare?  Hey.  All right.  What's going on?  Not much.  Listen, I'm a big listen to you guys.  I started listening to you a couple of months ago, you know, and Stalker Shirley or whatever 
[00:17:00]  her name is.  Stalker Shirley.  Good enough.  Yeah.  Well, huh.  You know, when I caught that, I was like, this chick is out of mine.  But, you know, you've got a lot of listeners from the black community checking you guys out.  Like the brother said before, sometimes you can be a little bit annoying, but most of the time you're kind of funny.  That's our jobs, I guess.  A little bit annoying.  We really like being annoying sometimes, though.  It's fun.  And you're funny when you do it, too.  All right.  Cool.  You know, I like listening to you guys.  I listen to you every day. 
[00:17:30]  Hey, if you thought Stalker Shirley was cool, what about the girl from yesterday's show?  Oh, she was a freak.  Holy ass.  Straight up freak.  I couldn't believe it.  And the guy, her voice was like, he was ready to whip an A in a minute.  He was not happy that she did the wiffle ball bat challenge.  Yeah.  Which I didn't understand, because of all the stuff she's admitting, she's making her you-know-what brie.  Exactly.  There was some sick crap going on, and then the boyfriend finally draws the line with the wiffle ball bat.  Something tells me she would beat the crap out of him.  I'm serious.  But, you know what? 
[00:18:00]  Where do you find these women?  It's like the Jerry Springer show, man.  I mean, you find some weird, freaky women.  You know, some of them I would risk you like to meet.  You know what I'm saying?  That chick, though, yesterday, with those stories, she was great.  How does she look?  Does she look good?  Scale of one to ten.  Opie, she's on the website.  Take a look.  All right, I want to do that.  I want to try to pull her out.  Well, let me-  Can I just say what I said after she left and, you know, I was brave?  Go ahead.  I said she must have been a looker before the H. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  She was a nutcase, though.  She did a lot.  I'll tell you something.  She was cool.  She photographs better than she looked.  Let me see her pictures.  You got one?  Yeah, look.  We're, of course, talking.  She's one of the, um, ooh, you sure about it?  Yeah, the second one's not bad.  Uh, she's in the whipped cream bikini contest.  Did the whipped cream actually stay on her?  Uh, yeah.  Did it run away from her or something?  No, no, it kind of-  No, thank God Barry Williams was there to, uh, make sure it stayed on.  Yeah, Barry from the Brady Bunch.  He was funny, too.  He was great. 
[00:19:00]  You go to www.com, you can see her pictures.  She's one of the contestants in our contest.  I sure will, guys.  All right, well-  See you with the good work.  Thank you.  Peace.  Peace.  All right.  Look at how well we're doing in the, uh, community.  Any, uh, ladies show up yet for the whipped cream bikini contest today?  Uh, not yet.  Girls, girls, girls.  A trip to Hawaii.  Yeah, this is, we've upped the ante with our, uh, internet contest.  This one is amazing.  Basically, uh, basically, uh, you come down, ladies.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe they're scared to get naked in front of a bunch of guys.  That's not, I mean, there, there are enough girls that'll do that anyway, and that's cool. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, but you don't have to.  You don't really have to.  We got a bathroom and everything.  Uh, what we need to do is put on a whipped cream bikini.  Yeah.  Or you can do it yourself if you're, you're feeling a little uncomfortable.  But, uh, ladies, just come down, you know, between now and seven today, and, and three,  three to seven, uh, the rest of the week.  Mm-hmm.  Show off what you got.  We'll put your pictures up on the, uh, the website.  And, uh, the grand prize is a trip to Hawaii, courtesy of Contiki Tours.  We finally got a good prize to give away.  And we got other prizes, uh, runner-up prizes that are really good. 
[00:20:00]  A three-day, uh, three-day weekend at Laurel Bay Inn in Ocean City, New Jersey.  Trip to Jersey.  Rock.  It's, uh, it's near Atlantic City, right?  Yes.  There you go.  And then we got gift certificates and other stuff from whippedcreambikini.com, who is sponsoring  this fine, fine contest.  Yes.  So we're patiently waiting for the first lady to show up today.  Uh, I think it's safe to say, contest wide open.  We have no ringers yet. 
[00:20:30]  No.  Not yet.  And we should give a prize to the first girl to come down here today.  I think they're all finalists, though, uh, Opie.  Yeah?  I would say all the girls that have shown up so far will be finalists.  Hey, could Kimmy win if we get her in a whippedcream bikini?  You get her in a whippedcream bikini.  She'll do it.  Anyone want to bet me?  We will get Kimmy in a whippedcream bikini today.  Oh, without a doubt.  Because it's not nudity.  She's totally fine with that.  Are you kidding?  Whipped cream bikini.  You do this. 
[00:21:00]  I don't know.  I'll give you something.  I got it.  I got it.  You want it, April?  I'll bet you a hundred bucks.  You'll bet me a hundred bucks that, uh, why?  You know something that I don't?  That he can't do it?  No, I bet you a hundred bucks that she won't do it.  Yeah.  Why won't she do it?  She won't do it.  Why?  You know something?  No, I don't even know her, but I'm just saying.  You know I'm...  She don't eat snakes.  Work that...  Would she get naked in front of you?  You know about me and the show, right?  I'm cheap, so if you have inside info, you've got to give it to me. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, if you could get her...  I mean, we don't even have to see anything.  I'm just saying.  If she goes into the bathroom...  Oh, yeah.  Comes out covered with just whipped cream...  Yeah.  I don't think you could do it.  I hope you can.  I think it would be very, uh, fun.  There's a morals clause?  Could be.  You never know what she's signed.  She supposedly signed a book this thick.  All right, we'll give it a shot when she gets here.  Don't make up excuses that she can use later.  Right.  Like, people employed by CBS can't win these prizes. 
[00:22:00]  We get her in a whipped cream bikini, that picture will be all over the world.  All over the world.  Because that was the one I was thinking, Rick, that I wasn't going to bring up.  But you had to bring up that other thing.  I didn't say anything.  Anyone else?  Ben, you don't think I can do it?  No, I think you can.  Really?  Ben's working today.  Yeah, it's not even a challenge with Kimmy.  Come on.  We'll have to see what he gets here.  Good luck to you.  I think Jim Norton's stopping by to say hi, too.  Anyone else stopping by today?  Nope.  You guys picked the worst day to film.  We had, like, Greg Brady here yesterday. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, man.  We had a great time yesterday.  Yeah.  All right.  The Greg Brady.  Take a march.  All right, we've got to take a break, Anthony.  Also, why don't we do it next?  Brother Joe has a country version of Stephen Lynch's Special Olympics tune.  Yeah, well, with the country version of ACDC, and people really like that, Joe decided to cover one of Lynch's songs, Special Olympics, in a country style.  Country style, and we'll do that next.  We found a girl that can shoot stuff from a private area. 
[00:23:00]  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, Anthony.  Sam Adams.  Oh, we love Sam Adams.  Loving the Sam Adams.  Drink it all the time, especially right after the show.  I'm looking for, you know, I get a little, I get a little itchy for Sam at about a quarter to seven.  You know, it shows, I'm looking at the clock, I'm like, then why are you drinking them at 410?  Well, because I get itchy again to have more at seven o'clock. 
[00:23:30]  Who are you kidding?  I know.  Because I love it.  We are allowed to drink in the studio again because we have to, you know, be on top of the sponsors.  We've got to understand them.  We've got to know what they're about.  We have to, you know, kind of silly to talk about Sam Adams while you sit here and drink a cup of coffee.  Yeah, I know.  We love Sam Adams.  Sam Adams now, exclusive sponsor of Project Greenlight.  Get this, it's a joint effort between Project Greenlight, Miramax Films, and HBO.  The winner of this contest gets to direct his movie, which will be distributed by Miramax Films. 
[00:24:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Chris Moore, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck will be executive producers.  They already got the winner, by the way, Anthony.  The winner is a guy from Chicago named Pete Jones.  Right, okay.  Used to sell insurance, now he's in the movie business.  Right.  How about that?  The whole contest and making of the movie being filmed.  And it'll become a 13-week HBO documentary set to air early next week.  There you go.  Brought to you by Sam Adams.  Drink it.  Buy it at a bar if you're getting beer for the house. 
[00:24:30]  Sam Adams, we love it.  You will, too.  Yeah, the summer ale is out right now, so if you haven't tried one, do so later on today, all right?  Yeah.  Sam Adams.  This cake from yesterday, that's the wacko, right?  Yeah.  I think she appreciates us calling her a wacko.  It's who?  Cake from yesterday.  Cake.  Who made her, you know what, breathe yesterday.  Oh, right?  Opie and Anthony's whipped cream bikini contest is brought to you by whippedcreambikini.com.  Junk gear, hot lingerie, and whipped cream bikini, babe.  Need we say more?  Whippedcreambikini.com. 
[00:25:00]  Dig the Chick.  The Radio Chick.  Weekdays, 9 to noon.  Hi, this is Christopher Titus.  I just finished doing the show, P and Anthony's show, on 102.7 WNEW.  And frankly, I'm a little f***ing pissed off!  We have come up with a brilliant concept, Anthony.  Yeah?  If you have a short attention span, this is the radio station to listen to.  This is the radio show to listen to.  Why sit through a whole STP song when you can get a taste of the best part? 
[00:25:30]  Of the best part?  The hook.  We give you all the hooks.  You don't need entire rock blocks.  No.  We give you rock chips.  Just imagine how many hooks we could play in a 92-minute period.  Oh, my God.  Hundreds of songs.  Hundreds of hooks.  Absolutely.  More hooks for your bang.  Might have noticed that.  More hooks for your bang.  I like that.  In recent days, you might have noticed when we come back from Kamara,  she'll be here in tune. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, it gives you enough.  Enough to rock, too.  Enough to sing the hooks.  There you go.  Now all the STP fans very happy we can go back to babbling like idiots.  There you go.  Hey, Ben, when's the STP album coming out?  It's right in front of me?  Why don't you just say it?  Ben was telling everyone in the back office.  June 26th, man.  New album.  New STP album.  Rock.  All new stuff.  Are they?  Yeah?  I'm sure we'll have the band on again to play acoustically. 
[00:26:30]  There's a great band that just pumps albums out and tours.  You've got to love it.  Meanwhile, Lane's laying in his own vomit.  Can't pump one album out.  And God knows we'd all die for one.  Yep.  All right.  212-757-1027.  This is WNEW.  Kimmy has made it into the studio.  Kimmy, of course, from Survivor.  Yes.  Looking like hell, though.  I got somebody's nose.  See, she's making believe she has an allergy attack. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Because she was supposed to be on Z100 this morning and she blew them off.  I did not blow them off.  But see, she's just better.  Hey, what happened?  Why couldn't we get Kimmy from Survivor?  That is so not fair.  We played a game with her.  We should never be on our show again.  It's so wrong.  Come on.  I have friends over there.  You do?  Yeah.  But I don't listen to their show because I wasn't in a year.  There you go.  No, they listen to us then. 
[00:27:30]  And they have told us so.  I know it's just five.  All right.  Yeah, you look a little...  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Your eyes look like the American flag.  You got the blue, you got the white, and now you got the red in there.  You all right?  Yes, I do.  She's all sniffly.  I'm all American.  Yeah.  But that's okay.  My voice is worse.  But you really don't need me to talk today.  I just got to sit here and look good for the CBS camera crew that is in the studio again.  Free by us.  Now, why don't you repeat what you said as you walked in the studio?  Oh, what I was saying is how you can't talk about me when I can hear you because I'm in  my car and you're making fun of me and I can hear everywhere that you're saying. 
[00:28:00]  She walks in, she goes, guys, you talk on the radio like no one can hear you.  I know.  Isn't that terrible?  I'm like, oh, yeah, I guess people do listen to this crap.  Yeah, and then I'm sitting in the car talking to myself.  Don't you stop talking about me and people think that I'm crazy.  You can't talk back to it, though.  No.  It's a one-way communication thing.  We talk and you get out of your radio.  But I'm loud enough.  You might be able to hear me.  You know when we learned that people actually listened to the show was when Sarah Jessica  Parker called right after we gave her a nasty, nasty trashing. 
[00:28:30]  Uh-oh.  It was right after the MTV Music Awards or the video, whatever it is, movie awards she  hosted.  And we just trashed her because it came off really bad.  I don't know.  The show stopped.  I said that she looked like Ruth Buzzy in a dress.  That's what did it.  She looked like Ruth Buzzy in a nice dress.  And all of a sudden, we get a call, Sarah Jessica Parker.  Don't you guys realize that we're people and we're listening out there?  Like, oh, I don't know.  Maybe you should just come in here and be goofy.  And for half the phone call, we didn't even believe it was her. 
[00:29:00]  And then I look at her and I'm like, oh, my God, I think it really is her, man.  Yeah, and it was.  Nobody likes to admit that they listen to you until all of a sudden they start trashing  them.  And they're like, that's it.  I listen to them.  I'll put my foot down.  No, I have to call and say, you guys suck.  All right, if you're famous, give us a call.  I want to see if there's any other famous people.  Hey, you don't want to rip off some other radio promotion going on.  What is that?  Getting famous people to call?  And get a buck or something.  Remember when we did that?  Like three years ago when we first got here?  Wait, did the notification do that? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  There's some kind of a contest going on.  Who?  Um, who the hell is it?  What's she listening?  Scott Shannon.  Oh, who cares?  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  But I hear Brewer called up for his grandmother or something or his mother or something.  Yeah, and they got to get the most famous person and whoever is the most famous person.  Oh, that's like, oh, okay.  That's one of the oldest radio gags in the book.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, like, at the end of the week, whoever is the most famous person that called, the  person that got them to call wins the prize. 
[00:30:00]  Right, right.  Remember when we first got here, we had, uh, please, if you're famous, call us up.  Yeah, that's all I want.  And who did we get?  Nobody.  We got Jeff Norris.  I swear to God.  That's right.  That's how we got him.  That's how we got out of stores.  But what was he famous for back then?  Just for doing Archie Bunker.  No, but he was on, like, an obscure commercial or something.  Yeah, I think that was it.  No, we don't need a whole contest.  If you're famous, just call us.  No, just call us up and we want to see.  But that contest is like, you know, um, someone from Jersey, uh, is a relative of Sylvester 
[00:30:30]  Stallone, so they call him in L.A. and they call this radio show.  Right.  I just want the people that are listening to our voices right now that happen to be famous  to call us.  Call us up and let us know what you've done on TV, music, uh, movies, and, uh, we'll see.  Because it's a good way to gauge who's listening to the show.  When we first did this years ago, we really got, I think we got one guy that did a reenactment  of a dead body.  In America's Most Wanted.  He played a dead body.  He played a dead body.  That was good.  We got, uh, Norris.  Right.  And we got, I think we got a soap star. 
[00:31:00]  And Sylvia Miles.  We got, remember her?  Half the people we had had tell them that they weren't famous.  I know.  Which was kind of awkward.  I know.  A little awkward.  Oh, no, so, Ann is wrong.  Most famous person was Grimace.  A guy that, uh, oh, he was the Grimace.  That's right.  Let me go to Joe.  Do you want to try McDonald's?  Uh, Joe.  Yeah, remember the guy called in?  He said he was dressed up as Grimace in the McDonald's commercials?  Yeah.  I forgot about that guy.  Very good.  All right, thanks, man.  All right.  Okay.  No, but, all right, you said that when you came into the studio.  What was the other thing, which is much more important? 
[00:31:30]  The other thing that I said was if I did not have to go to the doctor, because I'm going  to the special doctor today, I would, of course, wear a whipped cream bikini.  I see your legs, scumbag.  Whoa, Homer.  Look, I was the first one, celebrity person, to do Guess What's In My Pants.  Right.  She did do What's In My Pants, first celebrity to do that.  I told you on a Wednesday I would come in, because you guys would always have me in here  on a Thursday, and I said, get me in on a Wednesday.  Don't you know it's whip them out whenever?  I know that. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, and I did the other day when I got off the phone with you after Jerry Ramon died.  There was a guy in a big old truck.  I'm like, hey.  Oh, man, she's showing everyone else.  Why don't you show us?  Because.  Yeah.  You know, someone took your picture of, you know, the famous picture of you?  Yes.  That's been everywhere now of you, like, kind of flashing.  I think it was the Boi Barn.  Boi Barn.  And they have, like...  I had the little smiley face stickers on my boobs.  All right.  Well, now they've taken that picture and just given you these just massive breast implants.  Did it look good, at least?  It looks pretty good.  Okay, good.  Someone did a really good job with Photoshop.  Now you're just have boobs out the ear. 
[00:32:30]  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  One thing, girls that have been on TV or movies, when they hit the Internet and people start altering their bodies like that,  it's a good way to check out what you'd look like before any kind of a surgery.  Exactly.  Hey, I want to see what I look like with implants.  Just troll the web.  You'll find it.  Kimmy.  I want to see what I look like with a schlong.  Troll the web.  You'll find it.  Kimmy, you look good with double D.  Yeah, I could go for that.  Nice.  My sister-in-law just got really obsessed.  She was getting fitted for new bras.  She called her my brother, who happens to be an iron worker. 
[00:33:00]  And she's like, Troy, I'm so sad.  My boobs, they're a triple D.  Do you believe that?  My brother's a gay guy.  Triple D.  My girls are triple D.  Triple D.  Wow.  That's huge.  That's like basketballs.  A lot of girls choose to pain those down.  Yes, and she does.  She wears those very squishy bras.  Sometimes even have surgery.  Punky Brewster had that done.  You know that?  The punkster.  The punkster.  The punkster.  Punky Brewster.  Who knew when she was a little kid that she'd end up with these mammoth cans and she had 
[00:33:30]  to get surgery.  Right.  Little moon fry.  What a wave.  All right, so let's back back up.  Now, I bet everyone here that you would, you know, be a contestant in our whipped cream  bikini contest.  I was totally there.  Ben's the only one that said that you would do it too.  Would totally do it.  But that's the problem.  Now, I don't know who wins the bet.  Now, you said you would do it tomorrow.  I will do it tomorrow.  I will do it tomorrow.  Oh.  So you will.  I'm coming in tomorrow with the.  Jeff.  With a canoodler.  What's the canoodler? 
[00:34:00]  That went over everyone's head except Rick.  He did six of the Post last week.  What?  Oh, that's right.  You guys are making out of those.  The noodling.  You were.  Oh, yeah.  The Post loves to use the word canoodling.  But can I tell you something I actually looked up in the dictionary?  Because I'm like, what's canoodle mean?  It means like slurter sounds good.  It means shrimping.  No, shrimping is no sucking.  I know all about shrimping.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No, felching?  Canoodling?  Felching?  Wait, shrimping is.  Shrimping is too disgusting to even. 
[00:34:30]  But there's a whole thing in a fetch magazine where shrimping was co-sucking.  Fisting.  Fisting, very nice.  They were canoodling.  Tee-bagging in the back corner of a. . .  No, you were canoodling with some guy.  Yes, but you know what the canoodling was when I looked it up in the dictionary?  It says to caress softly while making love.  And I assure you.  Wow.  You were making love in public, huh?  Yeah, Jeff and I had no idea.  In the Post, it's got to be true.  Right.  So, Jeff, you're a guy, friend, thing? 
[00:35:00]  What's going on there?  I got me a new toy boy.  Oh, no.  I think they're just friends.  Yeah?  You were friends, but you just haven't. . .  You're going to have to ask him tomorrow.  Has there been heavy canoodling?  What kind of canoodling?  I like some of that heavy canoodling.  Stay tuned until tomorrow.  It's not like it's the survivor winner here.  You can tell it's this.  Right.  Is he the true survivor winner?  And I'm the prize?  Yeah.  We're in big trouble.  All right, so you'll do the whipped cream bikini tomorrow. 
[00:35:30]  And we'll put your pictures on the Internet and stuff.  Officially, you could win the current test, a trip to Hawaii.  Yeah, because I've just been another contestant.  It's not like I work for CBS.  I'm just a contestant.  When you dump a guy, do you just put his torch out and vote him off your bed or something?  I got to get pictures of the whole ceremony.  I'm sorry.  You're going to have to leave.  The torch gets extinguished.  Usually I just take a close.  Get the hell out.  I'm like, can I go to bed now?  That's awful.  I'm done.  I feel dirty. 
[00:36:00]  I want to take a shower.  No, I'm not buying her excuse why she won't do it today.  Why can't you do the whipped cream?  No, because I have a speaking engagement tonight.  And then I'm going to the doctor.  And I don't have time to take a shower and clean.  I don't want to go there smelling like stinking milk.  What doctor are you going to?  The special lady's love doctor.  You're going to the groin ecologist.  Yes, I am.  Oh, jeez, I don't want to hear about no groin ecologist, little girl.  Is that?  Yeah.  So you're going to just a checkup or is there any problems from the outback? 
[00:36:30]  It's just a regular checkup to get more of those pills.  Oh, because you're canoodling.  Oh.  You know what I was?  I went to my girlfriend's husband's 40th birthday party the other day.  I bet you did.  And there were a bunch of pregnant girls around.  And I said, I'm like, it's contagious.  Went home, took a whole pack.  I'm like, forget that.  So that awful when you see kids and you're so dead set against them.  Yeah, but they're all pregnant.  I'm like, oh, you know.  Did you stay on the pill in the outback?  Yeah.  So you were thinking, what the hell?  I might stay on the outback.  You were on the pill in the outback?  Yes, I was. 
[00:37:00]  Why bother?  You were ready.  An errant, horny kangaroo?  Because I was only actually in the outback for 15 days.  I had another three and a half weeks around Australia.  Oh, wow.  You've got to love this girl.  Did you bang an Aussie?  You know what?  I'm so disappointed in myself.  I did not.  I love this girl.  It was such a test of myself, too.  Yeah.  But I did teach everyone how to wow.  What was the problem with the Aussies?  Some of them had this little hygiene thing.  And you thought my hygiene thing was bad when I was in Australia. 
[00:37:30]  It's a former penal colony.  They're still working at it.  There were some Kiwi guys.  The Kiwi guys in the New Zealand people that collected a Kiwi.  Cheap effers.  Yeah, exactly.  But there'd be a whole bunch of them hanging out, you know, drinking beer.  And next thing you know, they're doing like this little dance thing that they do.  And they're like, ah, and chug a beer, throw a beer on each other, lick it off their face.  I was.  Whoa.  That turned you off a little bit.  Yeah.  It was a little too.  You got like a ring on the finger there.  Yeah.  It's my college graduation ring. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, I thought Jeff might have gave it to you.  That's a story that we came up with.  Yeah, you could do that.  You should have told people.  You should have banged in aborigines.  I said I didn't do people.  I could have done aborigines, but I can't.  Playing a little wacky instrument.  Or whatever.  So it's just to get some more pills.  Yes, it's just to get some more pills.  Well, you're not going to care if you have whipped cream on you anymore.  It's not like it's going to stick to anything anyway.  We all already know that. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, that's right.  You know, imagine being like gynecologist.  All of a sudden, another day at the office.  You know, he's used to seeing it.  He really gets a lot of people in there.  He probably doesn't want to look at.  And all of a sudden, who is this, Kimmy?  Coming in today.  Is it the first time or you use this guy all the time?  Actually, it's a woman.  Oh, God.  I like the woman.  Older woman?  She'd probably like it.  She's nice.  Very nice.  Why would a woman go into that field unless she's...  She's actually a midwife.  She's actually a midwife.  A midwife.  They're very nice. 
[00:39:00]  Does she have a mullet?  No, she doesn't have a mullet.  Yeah, but she has a nice job.  Oh, my God.  Your dirt haircut?  That woman gave me nightmares.  I actually woke up.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot that.  You got spit on.  You got spit on.  Yeah, I got spit on.  See what happens when you hang with O&M?  You get spit on when you hang out with O&M.  That's okay.  Saturday night, I was at CPI, and some guy drank, and then threw up on me.  He barfed on Kimmy?  He barfed.  He was like, ugh, sorry.  I was like, oh, I just got thrown up.  Well, I got paid well to get thrown up on, so. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, man.  So everyone heard it.  You will be here tomorrow.  No excuses.  And you'll do the whipped cream bikini.  I will do the whipped cream bikini.  I still think you can do it today.  What's the big deal?  She is...  Because I have to speak, and I have to...  She has seen worse, your gynecologist.  Look, we could...  Don't even go to the doctor.  We could do it.  Where's the stuff?  No.  Put your feet up.  Why?  No, because next thing you know, there'll be bottle rockets flying, and I am not having any part of that.  Oh, and a gynecological exam, up to start.  No?  No.  Tomorrow, though, you say.  Tomorrow. 
[00:40:00]  Tomorrow.  Okay.  We got one famous person on the line.  Who is that?  Devin?  Devin!  Yes, sir.  What's up?  How you doing?  Hey.  I'm mildly famous.  Who are you?  I was in Home Alone, one and two.  What are you listening to in the background, Devin?  That was nothing.  That was my mom's music.  I was buzzed in Home Alone.  Buzz in Home Alone.  One and two.  That's correct.  Is that the brother?  Yeah, the nasty older brother.  The bigger brother?  Wait a minute. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, no, I know exactly who he's talking about.  How old are you now?  I'm 24.  And no other roles came around?  Well, no, there's been a couple of things since then, but, you know, nothing like Home Alone.  Right.  There was Dennis Domenice.  I was in that.  Oh, yeah.  You were in Dennis Domenice?  Yes, I was Dennis, the babysitter.  All right.  I've been listening to your show for about a year and a half now.  Cool.  Devin Ranch.  Where do you live?  I live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  It is.  Wait, are you, like, looking me up on the Internet or something?  Absolutely.  Strong Island Boys.  Strong Island Boys. 
[00:41:00]  Yes, indeed.  Dennis Domenice, Home Alone 2.  Perfect Harmony.  Yes.  Little Monsters you were in?  I was in Little Monsters.  Wow, you got the whole thing right there.  Heartland.  Did you ever see that?  No.  No.  I'm looking at the Internet.  And you were on Law & Order back in 1990.  No, it was later than that.  It was 95.  Oh, playing Mitchell Pauley.  Oh, my God.  In the episode Performance.  You've got ESP.  You've got to love the Internet.  I don't do that.  I don't know who uploads that stuff.  Hey, Devin, come on down today.  We're having a party.  Girls are getting into whipped cream bikinis and stuff. 
[00:41:30]  You're kidding.  We've got Kimmy from Survivor in the studio.  Come on down.  You're famous.  All right.  You count.  I mean, what else are you doing today?  Doesn't sound like you have any auditions today.  Not today, no.  I was going to call up during Stoner Spelling Bee last week.  That would be cool to get, like, a celebrity in Stoner Spelling Bee.  In fact, I was also excited because, to tell you the truth,  my girlfriend is all-girls a Catholic schoolgirl, high school senior. 
[00:42:00]  Wow.  That's your girlfriend?  Yeah.  And I was getting kind of excited.  I thought you guys might be doing a Teen Week 3.  We're just thinking of the...  We're up to Teen 4,  and we're thinking of some kind of really good concept for that one.  But Kim's coming tomorrow for Teen Bikini.  Oh.  I don't know if I'd trust her around you guys with the whipped cream.  I'll supervise.  I'll take care of it.  Yeah, Kimmy's going to get into a whipped cream bikini.  I think she's full of ass,  but, you know, we'll give her a chance to prove me wrong tomorrow.  Your father was a soap star? 
[00:42:30]  Yes, he is, in fact.  One life to live, another world.  Give him a question, man.  Yeah, yeah, he's giving him the answers here.  What if it's not really Devin?  No, you can tell.  It's just his attitude.  You can tell?  Yeah, I can tell you're the real deal.  Why would you pick that guy?  Exactly.  It's a little too obscure.  You hang out with Macaulay these days?  Since he went to London to do the play, I've not seen him.  I was at his 18th surprise birthday party, though.  He hangs out like 57th and 7th.  We've seen him a bunch of times right outside the building. 
[00:43:00]  Is he a listener?  I don't know.  Invert him.  Oh, that would be too funny.  He was just hanging out on a street corner waiting for a cab to smoke, and it was just  the weirdest thing.  And he had a little hat.  That's great.  That is good.  Do I have to come down?  Here's the question.  What's your mom's name?  Ann Rattray.  Ann Willis Rattray.  Very good.  That's him.  What is my mother's name?  Train ride to Hollywood, 1978.  You know, we just got that on videocassette, and none of my parents nor I have ever seen 
[00:43:30]  it yet.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, Devin, come on down.  Where are you?  I'm going to put you on with the producer, all right?  All right, no problem.  We're looking for just famous people that are listening to our show today.  We're going to have famous people party today here on the show.  We don't want you to call someone famous.  We want the people that actually listen to our show.  Like, we found out Kimmy from Survivor was a huge fan of our show before she went to  the Outback.  That's all we're doing.  We're not trying to rip off anyone else's contests or anything. 
[00:44:00]  We're just curious.  Right.  You're famous, and you're listening to the show.  You're listening right now.  Give us a call.  He was the only one so far.  Can we rip off someone's contests?  No, because they're all stupid.  One of Buzz's famous lines from Home Alone, I wouldn't let you sleep in my room if you  were growing on my ass.  Well, you've got to have him come down.  Of course.  With lines like that.  All right.  We'll be back.  Jen needs help.  She wants to date girls.  And cake from yesterday.  Make sure cake doesn't hang up. 
[00:44:30]  We were supposed to talk to her during this segment, okay?  And CBS still filming stuff.  Cake to eat?  You're eating cake?  No.  It's something.  Can she hear me right now?  Did you hear the show yesterday with cake?  I didn't hear everything.  Heroin girl?  Hold on a minute.  Cake.  Cake.  Yeah.  We're going to talk to you next.  Okay.  You got some good stuff to tell us?  Maybe, but stop calling me howling girl.  What's that all about?  Yeah, Opie.  That was Anthony. 
[00:45:00]  It's crystal meth.  Actually, cake.  I'm kidding.  I'm sure.  Neither.  Neither.  I know.  You know, you've got to blame Kimmy on that.  Yesterday was the whole Whipple Bowl bad incident, right?  This is the girl.  We'll talk to her next.  Hold on, cake, okay?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  We'll do that.  It's just...  It's off of me.  What's your perverted cracker?  If you don't like it, you can sell.  Whoa!  What's that?  That we may love you.  Hey, Anthony, Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed, we know about that.

[00:47:00]  It's the O&A Show, 212-757-1027.  Kimmy from Survivor in the studio, friend of the show.  Yes.  So far, no one has shown up for our whipped cream bikini contest, Anthony.  No, we're waiting.  Girl, come on.  Patiently waiting.  Kimmy from Survivor will be in a whipped cream bikini tomorrow on our show.  She can't do it today because she's going to the special doctor, Anthony.  I sure hope you come through tomorrow and actually participate in it. 
[00:47:30]  I will come through tomorrow.  Yeah?  I bet I would.  She has a lot of excuses, Anthony.  I have no excuse.  I have allergies.  No excuses.  She says she'll only wow on a Wednesday in the studio.  Yeah.  So tomorrow should be a big day.  We'll get a flash, and we'll get a whipped cream bikini out of you.  What do I get?  You already have Jeff.  You get Jeff.  You can canoodle with Jeff.  Canoodling.  Can I get Jeff in a whipped cream bikini? 
[00:48:00]  Looking for famous people listening to our show right now, Anthony.  That's a no.  I'm actually trying to confirm one.  Right.  Devin from Home Alone coming down.  Yeah.  Devin played Macaulay Calkins' older brother, Buzz.  He's coming down to say hi in a little bit.  Jason, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Listen, I'm a semi-famous person.  I won $125,000.  I don't want to be a millionaire.  You did?  Yeah, I did.  When were you on?  January 10th and 11th and 12th, 2000. 
[00:48:30]  And I'm actually sort of the radio spokesperson for iWon.com, because I won $10,000 from them, too.  You're that guy?  I'm the annoying guy who's screaming for my father, yeah.  Dad!  Yep, that's me.  Oh, yeah.  I won $10,000 on iWon.com!  Yeah, that is an annoying...  Oh, that's you?  That's me.  So you didn't really win?  No, I did win.  That's why they made an assertion.  Turn your head away from the phone and do it exactly like you did it.  All right, hold on.  Because I got a little cold, but I'll try it.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Dad!  I just won $10,000 from iWon.com!  That's me.  I hate you.  I know.  We all hate that.  Oh, great.  I'm going to kick you in the nuts.  Great.  I'm sorry you hate me, but hey, I like Sam Adams.  What a good show.  But you were on Millionaire.  How was Regis?  You and I.  And why did you bow out at 125 grand?  I bowed out at 250.  I didn't know who was the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Oh.  What were the choices? 
[00:49:30]  It was Carole King, Diana Ross, Aretha Franklin, Janis Joplin.  Got to be Aretha.  I would go Aretha.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Give me some cake.  Yeah, we did $125,000 over here.  Did you have any lifelines?  At the time, I had two, but the audience didn't help, and the 50-50 didn't help either.  What was it down to?  It was down to Aretha Franklin and Diana Ross.  But the thing was is that I didn't think Diana Ross was solo after Supreme, so I couldn't 
[00:50:00]  know.  Because some people were inducted twice.  You know what, though?  You've got to know that they would give it to Aretha.  Yeah, well.  That's all right.  You've still got $125,000.  Not bad.  How much have the taxes?  Oh, about $1.25.  No, not much.  About $65,000, I would say.  Thereabouts.  Thereabouts.  Wow.  A lot of people say you sound just like our $100,000 prank call when you're doing the  I-1 commercial.  Oh, that's hard.  Who's telling me why?  I'm getting a new truck. 
[00:50:30]  Well, I'm sorry to have annoyed your wives for the last month or so.  That's okay.  Now we're giving you $65,000 and I pocket the rest.  That's about it.  Was Regis cool to you when you were on the show?  It was all right.  Yeah?  They were pretty good.  Uh-huh.  I also heard that, you know, you guys take a real long time to answer the questions and  they just edit that for TV.  That is true.  I mean, there have been times where people have taken like an hour to answer one question  and gotten it wrong and people are just driving, they're going nuts over there. 
[00:51:00]  Right.  But, yes, they do edit it out.  Ah.  All right.  You could take five days if you wanted to.  But then people would just basically blow your brains out.  Well, I'm surprised, though.  You either know it or don't.  I mean, I could see 10 or 15 minutes just to try to get your, you know, your head together.  But to allow an hour in between questions, the audience must go nuts.  Yep.  For sure.  What does the audience do?  The audience is basically sitting around fidgeting.  You know, you're quiet for a little bit and then, you know, they start getting antsy and some 
[00:51:30]  people say, well, let me just answer the question and stuff like that.  Right.  So, you know.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  So there you go.  Semi-famous person.  Thank you, Jason.  Thank you.  Hey, one more time.  I won the $10,000.  Oh, God.  Dad, I just won $10,000.  I won $10,000.  I hate that.  Well, you know what?  I got paid real well for that.  Yeah, I guess.  You know, because what happened was they recorded the phone call. 
[00:52:00]  And every time they played, they got residuals for it.  So you won a hell of a lot more than $10,000.  I got a nice chunk of change from being an annoying idiot.  So there you go.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Here's the famous call that we're talking about.  Oh, you got it?  The $100,000 winner.  We haven't played this in a while, but a lot of people say that that guy sounds a lot like  the guy we really tooled.  Oh, I thought you were playing his actual thing, his commercial.  Oh, I'm sure we got around here, but that's okay.  Everyone knows the commercial.  And here's our little prank call from Dementor World. 
[00:52:30]  That is pretty brutal.  Hi.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Wildam.  Hey, Craig.  Guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  Get out of the way.  I won.  I won.  I won.  You can't write.  107th.  Oh, wow.  107th caller.  Congratulations.  100 grand.  Oh, my God.  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I want to do with that?  What are you going to do with 100 grand?  Oh, man.  The first thing, I have this old...  Oh, I cannot... 
[00:53:00]  Jesus.  I got to come...  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner.  I'm the winner.  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand?  I got this...  Oh, man.  I got this...  For a truck.  I've got to get a...  No one.  A new truck.  Oh, that...  Oh.  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going to...  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just...  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you...  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand...  Bro, congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey, what the f*** you've been saying? 
[00:53:30]  I've been listening to the f***ing radio for like three hours, man.  You said 100 grand.  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's the candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy.  Oh, you guys are a bunch of toothpaste.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Congratulations, man.  Uh-oh.  How is that hurt so bad?  That's still one of my favorites of all time right there.  Dude, is line nine for real?  Let's see.  Because this guy's been in a few things. 
[00:54:00]  Fred.  Fred.  Hey, Fred.  Fred.  Fred.  Kohler.  Frederick.  Frederick.  Hello.  Hey, what's up, man?  How you doing?  Now, you are Frederick Kohler.  Yes.  Sounds like him.  What do you mean it sounds like him?  I don't know how Fred Kohler sounds like.  Of course.  I know who this guy is.  Fred.  Yes.  You were Chip on Kate and Alley.  Chip on Kate and Alley.  All right.  What movies were you in? 
[00:54:30]  I was in a bunch.  What do you want to know?  Which one?  Just name a few.  Name a few.  Like 1993.  83.  When you were a real little kid.  When I was a real little kid.  1983.  Mr. Mom.  I was in Alex Butler.  I don't know if you remember that.  That was a long time ago.  Oh, okay. 
[00:55:00]  Pickup artist.  Remember the kid from Kate and Alley?  Yeah.  It does sound like him.  Are you looking this up on the internet like we are?  What's that?  Are you looking it up on the internet like we are?  No.  I'm talking about it.  And you live in the city, listen to the show from time to time?  Yeah.  Every now and then.  Every now and then I catch you guys.  What were you on on HBO?  Oz.  Who did you play?  I played... 
[00:55:30]  I just played an inmate, a prisoner.  You don't remember the name?  He doesn't know who he played.  Pretty good part.  Oh, my name on the show?  Yeah.  Oh, Andrew.  All right.  Andrew Schillinger.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  You think it's him?  It does sound like him.  Mm-hmm.  Hmm.  You want to come in, Fred?  We're doing like a celebrity party today.  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard about that.  I was listening.  We don't really have any celebrities yet, but...  Where are you?  We're working on it.  I'm on the up-screen side.  Are you?  Yeah.  Well, come on down.  You want to come on down? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  You like a beer or two or something?  Absolutely.  All right.  Okay, hold on.  We'll give you the address.  Thank you.  Hold on a line.  All right.  Get that chip from Kate and Allie.  Dude, it sounds like...  And I've seen him in a hell of a lot of stuff.  I look at him and go, wait a minute.  Where's he from?  Oh, he's the kid from Kate and Allie.  Yeah.  Just kind of growing up.  And on Mr. Mom.  He was on Mr. Mom.  He was one of the little kids.  The little...  With the whoopee?  The guy with the whoopee blanket?  I don't know if he was the guy with the whoopee.  I don't think he was the whoopee kid.  The whoopee kid was very upset.  Wait, we could ask him.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  Hey, Fred.  Fred.  Fred.  Chip.  Fred.  Yeah, go on.  He answers to Chip.  You aren't the whoopee kid in Mr. Mom, right?  No, I said my brother was.  Yeah, you're the whoopee kid.  Chip.  Right.  Your brother was the whoopee kid.  Okay, cool.  Hang on.  All right.  That's the only kid I know.  I want the whoopee kid.  I want the whoopee kid, too.  No, this guy...  You'll know him when you see him.  All right.  You'll absolutely know who he is.  Hey, Matt, you're famous, too?  Yeah.  Um, I was on Channel 2 News when I was seven.  I don't think that's it. 
[00:57:00]  My mom had pictures, so you can check on the Internet, but I can show you on the picture.  Why were you on Channel 2 News at 7?  Now I'm going to sound bad, but I went to a Hebrew day school and some famous Israeli soldier  came, and I got to sit next to Jim Jensen.  You got to sit next to Jim Jensen?  Yeah.  Stop.  No.  He didn't cough up along on you, did he?  I get sick on the Internet.  I've never been in movies.  Yeah.  But I did also perform when I was 18 on Penn & Teller on Broadway. 
[00:57:30]  What'd you do?  I got called up to get the card.  And they got it.  Dude, come on.  Hey, we've been in New York.  You know, this would have flew like when we first did this three years ago, but, you  know, we got off the ante a little bit now.  I also just want you to know, my brother came up six months ago and started listening.  He lives in Virginia.  Yeah.  And he started listening to it, and now he found it on the ground, and there's a ton of  people down there who listen.  Oh, cool.  We'll say hi to everyone in where?  West Virginia?  Virginia. 
[00:58:00]  Like near Crystal City.  There you go.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Have a good one, guys.  All right, Matt.  Bye.  All right.  Here's Cakes from yesterday.  Cakes.  Cakes.  Cakes.  Hello.  Hey, sorry to make you wait so long.  That's all right.  A little busy today.  What's going on?  Uh, not much.  I just feel like my boyfriend got really pissed yesterday.  Yeah, we should explain.  Cakes came in to put on a whipped cream bikini.  She's in the contest.  Real quick.  What do you like?  I missed the first half of the show.  Now you remember the kid?  That kid's coming in? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  Remember him?  Chip from Kate and Allie.  That's pretty good.  Cakes, so, yeah, you came in, and then you told us some wild stories about you and your  brother and other women, and you made your balloon not breathe pretty much?  I missed that part.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, see, I was in transit.  See, if I had heard that part, I probably would have been a little bit even more pissed  off when I walked in.  Yeah, the boyfriend a little pissed off then, huh?  The thing is, it's like such a double standard, because if guys do crazy stuff, it's okay,  but when a girl does, she's like automatically a pig and a slut, you know what? 
[00:59:00]  I mean, but if you dared me to eat goldfish on this show, I would have done that too,  you know?  Yeah, right.  When someone gives me a dare, I take it.  Well, the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge was great.  You're the leader as far as the handle end goes.  Thank you very much.  We have two categories.  You're winning that category.  Oh, okay.  Most women like doing the handle side, yeah.  Well, yeah, I think that we should give my boyfriend the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  So, what happened after the show last night?  Did you guys go home and yell and scream at each other, and then what? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, we walked out of the studio, and he was yelling at me, and so I jumped on the N  train, I went downtown, and then he beeped me, and I went and met him over at his friend's  house, and then he screamed at me the whole way home, and I went to bed, and he screamed  at me this morning, and he was downstairs until he heard the show, and heard that I was  on the phone, and then he came back upstairs.  Did you have, like, serial killer sex or anything last night?  No, we haven't had the makeup sex yet.  Not the makeup sex yet, huh?  No, I haven't done that yet.  All right.  You think it's going to be wild when you do the makeup sex? 
[01:00:00]  All right.  At least he doesn't hit me, or else I'd probably be pretty beat up now.  Wow.  Hey, Jim Norton in the studio, and Jim Florentine.  You guys listened to the show yesterday with this girl, Kate?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who was doing the Whiffle Ball Bat and stuff?  Oh, it was beautiful.  All right.  You go over there.  I personally thought that it was funny, and he just got really upset because, I mean, I  guess he doesn't understand.  He's known me for 15 years.  He should know that I'm a little bit crazy and that I'll take a dare like that, you know? 
[01:00:30]  I just couldn't.  No.  After you guys dared me, I had to take the dare, you know?  What did she do?  I didn't...  She did the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Jim Norton's in the studio.  And she also showed us her balloon knot and made it kind of like, I think we could say  pucker.  It was amazing.  It looked like a volcano preparing to erupt.  She kind of went boom.  I missed that.  Boom.  Yeah.  It was great.  And then she told all these sick stories.  One time she shared a girl with her brother, kind of. 
[01:01:00]  Her brother, once she came home, she was drunk.  She gets in the bed, and the brother lays down in the bed with her, and they start making  out.  No, he was sleeping, and I came in, and so, like, but I was so drunk, I didn't know.  I thought that I was, like, at my boyfriend's house or something, and then I realized it  was my brother, and he realized it was me, and we were, like, ah.  And, like, ran in the other room.  We didn't talk about it for, like, ten years, and then one time he was drunk, and he told  me a story.  I didn't even remember it.  Yeah, those little things happen.  Yeah, you make out with your brother, you know. 
[01:01:30]  Well, yeah, you know.  It's kind of normal and stuff.  If you don't remember it, it doesn't count, though.  So, Norton, she tells all these sick stories, and then she shows us her balloon knot and makes  it kind of brief, right?  And then she goes, she's saving that for when she gets married.  Well, yeah, see, if I went to Hawaii, my boyfriend gets married.  The man I love will shove a bat in there.  I was trying to get him to do that, but, you know, he wouldn't take the challenge, you  know?  You're great.  I must say, we're going to have to have you back on the show soon.  Sure.  I'd love to come.  Yeah, you're a wild one.  She had originally thrown a couple of condoms, the flavored condoms into her bag, and I'm 
[01:02:00]  like, what's that for?  She goes, oh, one for Opie and one for Anthony.  Oh, is it the boyfriend?  Yeah.  The boyfriend.  Have you been on our show, by the way, before?  Me?  Yeah, you look really familiar.  No.  Well, I was in a band that played around New York a number of times, like, a long time  ago.  Oh.  Like, back in the early 90s.  Lou Reed's band?  No, no, no.  I played all the big clubs.  I don't know if you guys were hanging out.  The boys in the band?  What was the name? 
[01:02:30]  Dreams of Venus.  Oh, Dreams of Venus.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sure.  I got the T-shirt.  I got the T-shirt.  It's all, like, shrunk.  Yeah.  Just like my brush T-shirt.  Still happening.  It's a belly shirt now, but...  Yeah, it says I'll beat it from being in the wash too many times.  We wear it all the time, right?  Wow, you're too quick for me to take...  So she's saving...  She's saving the balloon knot for her wedding night.  Yeah.  Really?  She took the re-virgin pills, though, because... 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, re-virgin pills.  Virgin again pills.  Virgin again pills.  Yeah.  What's a...  What's virgin again pills?  They restore your hymen.  What is it, a glad...  Baggie?  No, it's actually just a joke.  It's just...  It's a novelty item.  She was a hoo-er.  Want to...  Want to just get the balloon knot?  But now I happily settled down with my boyfriend, who now is really pissed off at me today,  but we'll work on that one.  Yeah, it was obvious you were settled down abroad. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Very obvious by your actions yesterday.  Definitely.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't you just give the balloon knot to your brother?  Yeah.  If I win the trip to Hawaii, my boyfriend gets it.  Hey, that's cool.  Right, boyfriends?  Yeah.  Sure.  See, they already promised it a million times, unfortunately.  All right.  It's probably a healthy relationship.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Are you sure you're not Randy Jackson from Zebra?  No, I'm telling you.  All right.  We're going to let you guys go for now, okay?  All right.  Take it easy.  Hey, Cakes.  Good luck in the contest.  Thanks a lot.  So far, we only have three women on the contest. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, I saw my pictures on the Internet, so the computer pictures don't make you look  as good as possible, I don't think.  No, I would, uh...  I think you look pretty good.  Oh, thanks.  You look pretty good in those pictures.  Thanks a lot.  Surprisingly.  But, yeah, you look good.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Bye.  You guys have to be...  Take care.  All right.  Bye.  Let's see that special lens Rick was using.  What?  I'm looking at some of the people that are calling in now, and they're going to really  have to do a good job of selling this.  Our listeners wreck everything. 
[01:04:30]  I know.  They destroy everything.  Jim, we're looking for famous people that just happen to be listening to our show.  We do this from time to time on our show.  I caught the Celebrity Fest on the way in, man.  You guys are just...  The guy from Kate and Allie, and then the...  Yeah, Chip.  Did you see his picture?  You know the kid.  He's coming in.  Rick, he's coming in, right?  The guy from Home Alone 3?  Yeah, the older brother.  Whoa, man.  With the buzz haircut.  Hey, jerk off.  Jason.  What's up?  How you doing?  Hey, what's up?  Who are you?  My name is Jake Burke. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah?  I played Jimmy Kittner in the original Jaws.  Jeffrey Voorhees played Alex Kittner in the movie.  I was Jimmy Kittner.  Who's Jimmy Kittner?  Alex was my brother in the movie.  There is no Jimmy Kittner in Jaws.  Good job.  Have him...  He at least got the right name.  What?  That jerk.  That's classic.  That is good.  Let's go to Jen.  Jen, what's up?  What's up, Boobie and Anthony? 
[01:05:30]  Hold on one sec.  Someone's got to screen the celebrity people.  Because...  Yeah.  We can't waste it.  You can't screen them?  I can't talk out there.  Oh, you can't talk out there?  No, that's good.  Oh, they're filming.  CBS is still filming.  We can't...  Everybody out.  Jen, what's going on?  Nothing much.  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little situation.  Okay.  Sports Illustrated football phone?  No.  I was wondering if I could come down to the studio and you guys could help me find a chick.  And maybe you can bring in the lesbian couch. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, we do.  No.  Oh, sorry.  I just went insane for a second.  We haven't done the lesbian for a day thing.  No.  In a while.  Where do you live, Jen?  I live in Bayonne.  Bayonne.  Bayonne.  Beautiful.  Well, why don't you come down tomorrow and we'll try to get something going on.  You got a nice body?  Yeah, I think it's pretty decent.  Describe your little self.  All right.  I'm 5'8", between 120 and 130 pounds.  5'8", I won't be.  Yes.  That's good.  That's good.  I had to do the math in my head. 
[01:06:30]  Very good.  5'8", 120, 130.  Yeah, it's okay.  That works.  Okay.  I have burgundy hair, brown eyes, and test size, I would say, is a C.  C?  Yeah.  I don't wear bras anymore.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  How old are you?  20.  All right.  Hey, right now, you're thinking that's a good idea.  You're sacrificing comfort now for a flapjacks later.  I know, I know.  Once in a while, I do.  But during the summertime, I try not to because it's all, you know, hot and nasty. 
[01:07:00]  You know, we shouldn't be the people that actually promote this.  But, you know, girls, when you're not just topless, which we do prefer, wear the bras.  Because you're just going to end up, it's going to make things really horrible to look at later in life.  Yes.  We don't like walking around and seeing the big sweat socks full of sand.  Right.  Do you sweat underneath them?  That's a good question.  That's a good way to gauge it.  Madam.  Jim?  Yes.  Hello?  Jim Norton's talking to you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, that's okay.  I had a very valid question. 
[01:07:30]  I was just wondering if you beat up a lot of perspiration under your unbroad breasts.  No.  No.  And if so, does it smell like lamb?  Definitely not.  Oh.  Oh, God.  It's not very nice.  No, you're just asking.  I'm only curious.  No.  You know, lamb feels good, but not in the context of under-breast sweat.  Very good.  We have to screen her.  I don't know where to go.  Oh, yes.  You get to know.  Is that one of the no-nos?  I think that one's the road.  Oh, that's funny.  Is the F word one of the no-nos? 
[01:08:00]  That's Papa no-no.  That's the first song for the day.  We started a new thing on foundyourmusic.com.  It's finally linked on the website.  You can check out the dump sheet from our show.  And there are some funny things that you can read that were dumped out of our show.  At the end of every show, we get a sheet from the dump guy of what was said and who said it.  Why don't we get yesterday's dump sheet?  Because we could just say the word by just saying the word.  All right.  Good idea.  Just to give you an example.  It's really funny.  Russell up that dump sheet.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Or go to foundry.  I think it's up.  Foundry.  Hey, no.  I'm not even going to try.  Because then I just get in trouble for saying I can't find anything on foundry.  Jed.  Yes.  So what kind of girl are you looking for?  Well, basically somebody that has a wild side to them.  What kind of lesbian thing do you want going on?  Oh, anything.  We go hardcore.  Hardcore.  Yeah.  With strap-ons and stuff around here.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:09:00]  Strangulation.  Would you object to something with two heads on it and some piano wire?  All right.  Hold on, Jed.  Okay.  All right.  Jed wants to be lesbian for a day tomorrow.  Any ladies out there that are interested, give us a call.  Okay?  All right.  So here are the dumps from yesterday's show.  Oh, God.  How do we even get past the first one?  Well, whatever.  See some guy with his blank on your chin. 
[01:09:30]  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Just the word S.  No big deal.  Caller during discussion of male strip clubs and what are in the pictures.  That's where I came from.  S caller.  Yeah, the S word.  The F word.  Opie.  That was out of the commercials.  Oh, may have been partially caught in studio, but to be sure, I took it.  It was too close.  Yeah.  You said the F word, but I think you left out the K.  Right. 
[01:10:00]  It's blanking out of me.  Some chick said that.  Well, you know something?  Yeah.  Okay.  Actually, we could probably say it right now just reading it without giving a description  of what it was talking about.  It's coming out of me.  Right.  What does that mean?  In the context of yesterday, we had to dump it.  Are you leaving, Kimmy?  I have to go.  You're going as a rhinocologist?  Yes, I'm going.  I have places to go, people to do, things to see.  Oh, my God.  I have to go. 
[01:10:30]  Norton, you owe us, man.  Because when we met you, you had like pigs hanging out with you.  Now look what you got.  He's feeling up, stalker, patty.  And now Kimmy's all over him.  I know.  I love this head of his.  I got HIV leaking into my shorts right now.  Oh, my God.  That'll make the dump sheet for tomorrow.  I have a headache and run.  All right, Kimmy.  I just shaved my privates.  But I'll see you tomorrow.  All right, Kimmy's going to be in a whipped cream bikini tomorrow.  Yeah, I know.  Of course.  24 hours early.  No, I can't come tomorrow.  Oh, fuck. 
[01:11:00]  How are you going to miss that?  I believe you.  I would rather...  What are you?  What is Jesus coming to perform a miracle on you or something?  That's the only thing I can imagine.  Kimmy makes me very happy.  Look, she's going, I love you.  She's like doing animal things to you.  She just looks at me as some sort of repulsive possible sexual toy.  But you don't even care.  No.  It's great.  I love this buzz in his head.  Like some sort of outhouse experience.  Okay, I got to go.  All right, say hi to the gynecologist for us, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Maybe I'll ask her to take pictures, huh?  If only one day you could be as intimate as Voss is with the... 
[01:11:30]  Okay, okay.  All right, bye, Kimmy.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Here's another one we can say without giving any context.  All right.  As long as you can insert it.  You could say that.  You could say that.  Just not in the context of what we were saying yesterday.  Right.  Now, this one you can't.  This was during the chick during Wiffle Ball, that challenge.  Helped define sexual content and, well, another word.  I wouldn't give him, uh-uh, so he turned gay. 
[01:12:00]  Balloon not.  Right.  Why can't you say the next one on the radio?  I don't know.  During Wiffle Ball, that challenge, painted a picture of where this bat was and what it looked like.  It looks like she's well hung.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Well, whatever.  Just stick this, uh, him, and he would not like it.  Right.  Well, basically, it's fun to read. 
[01:12:30]  I guess we can't really read it on the air.  Yeah, it's just fun to read.  But go to foundrymusic.com.  It's a new bit where we just put the dumps on the website, okay?  There you go.  What happened to Jen, the lesbian?  We lost her?  Yep.  In the translation there?  All right.  Wormster.  Yes, sir?  Hey, wait a minute.  You were that guy?  Yep.  Andrew Kasich.  Yeah.  Wait, you were in Revenge of the Nerds?  Yeah, the first one and the second one.  Nerds in Paradise.  You were the little kid?  Yep.  With the glasses? 
[01:13:00]  Hey, we grow up.  How can you prove it?  That's okay.  Drive around in a Jag.  How old are you now?  29.  You were pretty nerdy in that movie.  Well, you know, people grow up, man.  Right.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's quiz you a little more.  What else did you do?  First thing I ever did?  Yeah.  Back to life.  Uh-huh.  Who were you?  Craig. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  Well, you could have a computer.  Where are you in New York right now?  I'm not in New York.  I'm in the outside area.  Oh, too bad.  Because we're having everyone come down today.  Yeah.  Well, I went to NYU film school.  Did you?  Yeah.  Well, I'm trying to find a picture, but all right.  You remember that TV show, TV 101?  No.  It was on CBS?  No.  Yeah, it was actually, what the hell is the guy's name?  Now I'm drawing a blank.  Jason Robards' son.  Well, could you come in the next time you're in the city? 
[01:14:00]  Sam Robards.  Thank you very much.  Yes, Sam Robards was a school teacher, television class,  and we did a news show.  Can you come into the studio next time you're in the city?  Sure.  That'd be the best way to do this.  When are you going to be in?  When I'm actually Mr. Cassis.  I pulled it on you, dudes.  I do have a computer.  Ah, yeah.  I got you, okay.  I win.  That sucks.  I win.  But it's not fun for us and our listeners.  Yeah, it is, because we finally got one of you guys.  I feel like this idiot. 
[01:14:30]  You know what it was?  He picked a good celebrity, though.  He picked a guy that didn't have much of a, uh...  He had two films for us.  Yeah, I know.  It was like...  I was going to get a Jaguar or something.  Two films.  He was good, though.  Yeah.  Hey, you've got to give it to him.  Okay, we'll give him a bell.  Let me go to Savannah.  Savannah, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I was wondering about something about the contest.  Yes, the whipped cream bikini contest, the grand prize, a trip to Hawaii.  Is there any way you can go on without having your face be seen?  Yeah, we do that all the time. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Are you that ugly?  Yeah.  Is it because you've got the ugly mug, or are you just the one coming to you?  I just...  Jealous boyfriend?  What's the deal?  No, you know, my father or whoever, you know?  No, you could...  We do that with all the contest.  We just do it in the bathroom, and we shove your head into the toilet.  Oh, my God.  But how many more do you need to go on for?  I would have to say, though, if you don't show your face, Savannah, I think your body's  going to have to be that much more special. 
[01:15:30]  Wow.  You got a nice body?  I think I do.  All right, cool.  Then come on down any time...  Many other people think I do as well, so...  Well, come on down any time between now and Friday, between 3 and 7.  Between 3 and 7?  Yeah.  Okay, great.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Cool.  We'll see you down here.  Okay, bye-bye.  All right.  Yes, girls, come down.  All right, we've got to take a break, Anthony.  Jack Klugman.  Come on.  You know what the joke is going to be right now.  You know what the joke's going to be. 
[01:16:00]  And someone wrote, Broadway actor.  All right.  Oh, really?  You know what the joke is down.  Hello, Mr. Klugman.  Yes, sir.  How are you doing?  Okay.  Wait a second.  Why are you laughing?  Because you don't sound like Jack Klugman.  Well, what do you expect me to sound like?  Let me ask you that first of all.  You sound more like Gene Sissel's brain.  No, I'm being serious.  You think I'm putting it in the voice?  I absolutely am not.  No, even with the raspy voice, it doesn't sound like Jack Klugman does with the raspy voice. 
[01:16:30]  Well, he had the throat cancer.  We all know that.  I had throat cancer.  That is correct.  It sounds like Vinny the racist with throat cancer.  No, it's not Vinny the racist.  You know what I'm talking about, Anthony.  How can you prove that this is Jack Klugman?  It's so not Jack Klugman.  I know.  We'll give him a shot.  Wait, let me ask you a question.  Yeah.  Why would you not think it's Jack Klugman?  Because you don't sound like Jack Klugman.  Okay, okay.  You haven't seen me in person. 
[01:17:00]  Did you see me recently in the play?  Well, where are you right now?  I'm right right now.  I'm on the Hutchinson Parkway right outside of the Bronx.  That's where Jack Klugman hangs out.  Yeah.  He's gone.  He's getting back to the apartment.  No, I happen to be heading back.  I happen to be heading back into the city.  He's going to play cards with Murray.  No, I'm not doing that either.  You sound too young.  You even have a bad throat.  You do.  You do.  Your voice doesn't sound like Jack Klugman's voice. 
[01:17:30]  Okay, well, again, like I asked you, have you recently heard my voice?  Did you see me on any of the shows recently promoting the play?  You come down, Jack.  Stop it.  How old are you, Jack?  Oh, God, here we go again.  68.  68.  You're like 79.  At least.  You were 54 in the odd couple.  Right.  All right, Mr. Klugman.  Thank you for calling in, Mr. Klugman.  Let's hear your real voice before you hang up. 
[01:18:00]  Okay, the first thing is, this is not Jack Klugman.  Wow.  Oh, let me get over the shock of that first.  Wait a second, let me, but this is truly my voice.  I happened to have a battle cancer last summer.  I got ass cancer, Tony.  Help me.  No, that's the truth.  I'm not putting on any voice.  You got a voice box or anything?  No, I had half of my, I had what they call the partial laryngectomy, which is removing 
[01:18:30]  one vocal cord and half of my voice box.  42 years old.  Do you still smoke?  Do you still smoke?  I never did smoke.  And I don't drink alcohol.  And I work out.  No, you know.  Look for that on the dump sheet tomorrow.  Nice.  That ain't going to make the air, Jim.  That'll be on the dump sheet.  You can see what he said on the, uh, and I don't, I don't think he did that to the Marlboro  man.  Five weeks, uh, five years ago, I had, they found a tumor on my right vocal cord and they 
[01:19:00]  gave me radiation, but they never told me that one out of 10 million people can get a  record, uh, a secondary tumor because of radiation.  And that's what happened to me five years later.  So that's, so I had the surgery to remove the vocal cord.  Can you be more funny?  I was trying to be funny to you.  I'm so funny. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  All right.  Well, all right.  What's your real name?  My name is Scott.  Thanks, Scott.  Thanks for calling us today.  All right.  Bye.  Anyone else with a F'd up voice, please call the show.  Oh, gee.  We'll have like, uh, celebrities, people with F'd up voices.  A carpet maker.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's an F'd up voice.  And girls that want to be in the whipped cream bikini contest.  All on the own every Saturday. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  What happened today?  We'll, we, we don't have anyone coming down to the whipped cream bikini contest.  We were doing very well yesterday.  It's because I'm here.  And then something happened.  We have a trip to Hawaii.  You know what happened?  My fat and meaty body.  That's what happened.  Ah, sucks.  You reamed it.  Well, no, that's still early, man.  We got until Friday.  I mean, don't lose faith.  Sometimes listeners lose faith in these contests.  We always win in the end.  Right, Anthony?  By Friday, we'll have a nice contest going on. 
[01:20:30]  Opie, a combination celebrity and bad voice calling in.  Oh, yeah?  Well, doggie.  Yes.  It's Uncle Jed.  Well, doggie.  All right.
