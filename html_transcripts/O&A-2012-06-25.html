<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts' characteristically self-aggrandizing yet self-deprecating introduction.  Opie recounted a surprisingly well-behaved weekend at a state fair, populated by individuals he described as "undesirables," alongside Big Kev.  This segued into a brief discussion of recent police shootings in Denver and New York, touching upon gun control.  The conversation then heavily focused on Opie's near-catastrophic nighttime drone flights over Long Island, culminating in a crash landing in his pool. He showcased video footage highlighting the drone's unexpected altitude, revealing Manhattan on the horizon, raising concerns about the legality of his actions.

Returning to the state fair, Opie detailed the pig races, a depressing elephant, and a plethora of deep-fried delicacies (Oreos, Kool-Aid, bubble gum, Twinkies, etc.). He described the disappointing sideshow attractions, including a underwhelming “world’s smallest woman” and a fake Fiji Island mermaid, as well as a legless performer, prompting discussion about the individual's physical capabilities and perceptions. The hosts lamented the overall decline in the quality of classic carny attractions.  The news story about Knicks player Amari Stoudamire using a homophobic slur in a private message to a fan was then discussed, much to their disbelief and annoyance.  The show concluded this segment with a discussion of the Gay Pride parade and a vulgar joke about vaginas and Jimmy Durante.

The show then shifted to an internal staff dispute concerning intern protocol.  The hosts explained the ban on Kenny's direct interaction with interns, stemming from a vaguely remembered "Sal incident" involving complaints about workload and possibly involving Travis and Gary.  The discussion encompassed E-Rock's role as interns' supervisor and the perceived bureaucratic inefficiencies, leading to on-air complaints and requests for coffee and ice.  Intern Kevin's report that Kenny was "mean" was discussed, attributed to Kenny's communication style and the restrictions on interaction.  Kenny's use of the word "acquiesce" in an email, resulting in a reprimand, was also mentioned. Anthony's recent illness and its impact on communication with management were also aired.  The role of Iraq, another staff member supervising interns, and his repeated urging to relinquish this role, was also discussed. The segment ended with a humorous, unsuccessful attempt to have intern Kevin ("Uncle Kevi") perform a music break on air, showcasing his inexperience.

A significant portion of the following segment featured "Uncle Kevi's" repeated, unsuccessful attempts at song introductions, punctuated by the hosts' mocking interruptions.  His supposed lack of radio experience and knowledge of classic radio personalities like Pete Fornitel and Cousin Brucey was heavily ribbed. His aspirations (becoming a music jock or opening a bar), his invented holiday "Half a Christmas," and the challenges of working in radio were also discussed.  E-Rock, the hosts' bodyguard, was mentioned, along with a humorous threat to punch him on-air. Past intern antics, including incidents involving dog feces and retrieving waste from a toilet, were recounted.  The hosts then discussed former intern Jared Fishman's attempt to start an iced tea company ("My Tea"), playfully considering becoming spokespeople.

The conversation shifted to the Jerry Sandusky trial and its aftermath, with the hosts expressing strong opinions about Sandusky, his lawyer Joe Amendola, and Dottie Sandusky, focusing on their perceived lack of remorse.  This transitioned into a broader discussion about the Penn State scandal.  The three-year anniversary of Michael Jackson's death was briefly mentioned, leading to speculation about his children, Paris and Prince, and a comparison of Prince's resemblance to Corey Feldman, using online image searches and manipulation tools.

The final segment heavily featured graphic and controversial news stories.  The show started with an attempt to identify a young Corey Feldman, transitioning into sexually explicit speculation about Michael Jackson's alleged sexual activities.  The hosts then discussed a Florida man who avoided bestiality charges due to a legal loophole regarding oral sex with animals, followed by a discussion of another man charged with both child pornography and bestiality involving his girlfriend’s three-legged dog.  A man charged with possessing pictures, but not having sex, with a 17-year-old girl was also mentioned.  The show covered a 19-year-old charged with bestiality for having sex with two pit bulls, followed by a 22-year-old cheerleading coach accused of performing oral sex on a 17-year-old basketball player, with the hosts speculating on her potentially lenient treatment due to her attractiveness.  A lengthy discussion followed about Karen Klein, the bus monitor who received significant donations after a viral video of children bullying her.  The hosts expressed anger and disbelief, commenting on the amount raised, the children’s apology, and Klein’s response.  A live phone interview with Klein and her son ensued, during which the hosts continued their commentary and sarcastic remarks about Klein’s hearing impairment.  Jim Norton performed a live read for CougarLife.com.  The broadcast concluded with promotion of Jimmy's upcoming events and a future segment, interspersed with crude humor, fart jokes, and offensive language throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Not enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Now that the 20-minute intro is done, our self-serving 20-minute intro. 
[00:00:30]  Pompous, fucking grandiose intro music.  Like we're a fucking epic.  We are epic.  We are epic.  We're very epic.  Epic fail.  It's Monday, huh?  Good morning, everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Monday.  Hi there.  Everybody's weekend good, I hope.  Oh, yeah.  I went to a state fair. 
[00:01:00]  Ooh.  I was thinking about you.  Why?  What happened?  A lot of undesirables there.  Oh, at the state fair.  But they were all behaving.  I'm like, man, I wish I could see undesirables behaving.  No way.  Well, state fair.  That isn't really a place for gangsters.  Oh, there were gangsters.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  There were gangsters.  But everybody was well-behaved?  Everyone was well-behaved.  Like that jazz festival out in Denver?  Oh, that's right.  There was a shooting.  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even know what happened. 
[00:01:30]  A female cop got shot in the face.  Killed.  Where?  At a jazz festival in Denver.  It was, you know.  And then a cop got shot here in New York, too.  Up in the Bronx.  One on the leg.  One on the shoulder.  You know.  How's he doing?  Oh, he's okay.  But, you know, Bloomberg started talking about how those guns have to be regulated, I guess.  But, you know, they're illegal anyway.  Was it a legal gun?  Of course not.  Of course not. 
[00:02:00]  But, you know, legislate more against me.  Because people just can't fucking...  It's like handing them to children in a crib.  Ridiculous.  I don't care.  I just fucking...  I sequestered myself in my house this whole weekend.  I didn't see any undesirables.  I was home.  Except Jimmy.  The only undesirable.  I happen to be.  I was very desirable.  Yeah.  My swim trunks.  Yes. 
[00:02:30]  He was desirable.  Wow.  I don't know why I think when I eat like a fucking pig at your house, it doesn't count.  That's literally all.  I walk in the door, I eat fucking chips.  Like that.  And pretzels.  I don't think it's going to put weight on me.  It's fucking awful.  Those lemon fucking chips.  They're lime.  Lime, lime.  Yeah, the lime tortilla chips.  Oh, those are terrific.  They're the best thing ever.  They're the best thing ever made.  Those are great.  God, are they great.  Not a lot of calories in that.  Don't worry about it, Jimmy.  Oh, no, there are.  Oh.  And then I decided that after a few Captain and Cokes... 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  ...that I was going to do night carrier ops with my helicopter.  Oh, boy.  I was going to try to land it on one of the floaties in the pool at night.  How did that work out for you?  Did you at least get good video before it sunk to the bottom?  I did get video.  All right, good.  I certainly did.  Did you try that?  Oh, yeah.  How'd it do?  Almost made it.  Oh, boy.  I hit the edge of the little floaty. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  And it rolled over right into the drink.  Bloop.  Is it going to work again, you think?  No.  I had to get another one.  Oh, you ruined it?  I ruined it.  I wrecked it.  You tried to dry it out at least?  Yeah, I dried it out.  And it didn't work.  The next morning, I waited all night.  And then the next morning, I turned it on.  Yeah.  And I heard, and then I saw a little waft of smoke come out of two of the motors. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, yeah, that's not good.  It went, son of a bitch.  What are we looking at right now?  Oh, that was the altitude.  I went up as high as I could possibly get it this time.  Oh, very cool.  It went really high up to where I couldn't even see it.  How high?  It was a dot.  It doesn't tell you on the readouts?  No, there's no altitude readout, but I was able to see Manhattan.  No.  Yeah.  Is it on the video?  Yeah, you could see on the horizon, once I get it up as high as I could get it, this 
[00:04:30]  is the AR drone that is put out by Parrot.  I guess it's called Parrot.  And I got it up as high as I could.  It went really high.  You could see the parkway at one point and major roads and then buildings.  And then at one point on the horizon, you see Manhattan, like way in the background.  But that thing was really up high.  And I'm kind of in the flight path of JFK and LaGuardia, and I was kind of like thinking 
[00:05:00]  I might get this thing sucked up in one of the engines.  Oh, my God.  No, it wasn't that high, was it?  I have no idea.  I can't judge height.  How are these legal?  I'm terrible at judging height.  Yeah.  So I had no clue, but that's pretty...  What road is that?  That's the Northern State Parkway.  Holy shit.  In Nassau.  Yeah.  That's pretty fucked up.  It's pretty...  God, and it's still going up at that point.  It's still climbing.  The things are fucking cool as hell, though, man. 
[00:05:30]  Why doesn't that have an altitude thing?  It should, shouldn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, I would think it would be something that would be valuable.  Yeah, yeah.  Worthwhile to the user.  Yeah.  That is pretty fucking high, man.  Now it's really fucking up there.  What the fuck?  And this is just a shitty little helicopter from Brookstone.  Yeah.  It's like a little toy.  To the right of that little block building, you can see Manhattan.  It's way over there.  Way in the horizon.  You can see the south.  Is that 100 feet?  That's way higher than 100 feet. 
[00:06:00]  That's way higher than 100 feet.  Can you make that full screen, Sam?  Holy fuck, that's...  100 feet is like the treetops way down there.  Yeah.  You can see Manhattan, see?  That's at least 500, 600 feet at this point.  I don't know.  I'm really bad at judging height, but I know that's fucking way up there.  It's way above the trees.  I was talking about this.  You're going to make these things illegally.  You know that.  Yeah, probably.  Probably no one knows Brookstone's making these.  That's even like selling these. 
[00:06:30]  Well, to this point where they could go up this high and do all these fancy things.  And you could just, you know, I think they put a warning in the booklet that comes with  it about video recording people through their windows and stuff.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is that legal?  It is illegal to record people in situations that are, you know, embarrassing and this and  then post it.  Do not do this.  And I think that's one of the towers at Kennedy.  Oh, I see the Manhattan buildings now. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, you could see the skyline.  I see the skyline.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, it's really screwy.  Is that the city bank building right there to the left?  I think, yeah.  Oh, well, you had to turn.  Oh, that's, yeah.  Why did you have to turn?  Why are you turning away?  Why are you turning away?  I can't see.  Are you coming back down?  Yeah, I'm coming back down now.  That's what I'm doing.  See, I'm much lower now than I was.  Right.  Once it's way up there, I start thinking, oh, my God, I'm never going to be able to get this  down.  I have no idea where it is.  How the fuck do you get it back down in your backyard?  I know.  It's amazing. 
[00:07:30]  How do you do this?  I don't even know.  But it comes right back down into my backyard.  I need one of these in Manhattan.  And oh, I will be looking in windows.  Looking in windows.  I'll be going up and down every building.  Yeah.  And then it just comes right back down.  And there you go.  And then you hit the land button.  And then it just fucking.  Soft landing on the patio next to the pool.  Wow.  And it was way up there.  Bravo.  But you lost that version.  Uh, yeah.  Well, that was actually the new one. 
[00:08:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Because the night before I had that video, I'll post it.  And you actually see it just bloop right into the drink.  Everyone jumps in.  For a little while?  Yeah.  Like, you see the camera, like, underwater a little bit.  Yeah.  And then you just see everybody jump in, trying to freaking get it out of the water before  it screwed it up.  But to no avail.  All the party people?  There were a couple of party people.  All the party people trying to find, save your helicopter.  Yeah.  I tried.  I was so close, too.  Hmm.  I think if it was one Captain Morgan and Coke earlier, I would have stuck that landing. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  But then you probably wouldn't have tried it.  Right.  It's a balancing act.  See?  I have enough in me to try this.  It was awesome.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  I was really trying.  You want to go to a state fair?  No.  A state fair?  Well, I think I went to one in upstate New York.  Yeah.  Years ago with one of the exes.  Yeah.  Yeah, I went.  Nothing to really speak of.  A lot of John Deere tractors. 
[00:09:00]  They were showing people.  And, like, booths to sell a bunch of hillbilly shit.  A bunch of really bad food.  Carnies.  Carnies.  Rubes.  I think the carnies are all ex-radio guys.  They all have that cadence to them.  Ex-radio guys on crystal meth.  Holy fuck.  A lot of crystal meth.  Holy fuck these guys don't play.  You can tell they've seen everything.  And they're not scared of any one.  Yeah.  These carnies.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, they're miserable.  They've been doing this for fucking... 
[00:09:30]  Forever.  Forever.  Just trying to rake people over the coals to find their next mark.  They make believe it's the first time they've ever done it.  But, you know, they're just sitting there like, oh, fuck, another state fair.  Trying to get a few bucks.  I saw my first pig race.  Oh, all right.  I'm not even going to.  I'm going to leave them alone.  We should.  Which, in essence, isn't leaving them alone, is it?  We should do our own pig race with real, you know, real pigs.  Oh, wow.  And I know we can find some pigs that would do that for us. 
[00:10:00]  Of course we could.  How do we get this done?  Let's start doing bits again.  Oh, but good luck.  We get a bunch of fatties.  Yeah.  Hence the pigs.  Don't talk about it.  It's a contest.  And we put them...  Oh, really?  Don't talk about it.  Are we allowed to talk about this, A-Rock?  As long as you're not offering a...  A prize?  A prize.  It's not a contest.  How great would it be, our next live appearance, we have a pig race?  Have to be one charming motherfucking pig.  Like that Arnold from Green Acres.  We'll put them in some kind of fucking sloppy outfit. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  They have to be on all fours.  We put numbers on their back.  Come on, let's do this.  I know we could find five girls to do this.  Of course we could.  We'll pay every single girl money to do this.  Come on.  We could find five girls with a sense of humor?  Yeah.  Come on.  You can even wear masks if you don't want to, you know...  Oh, I think they should have to.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think a mask, a little pig nose should be managed for it.  Oh, a little piggy mask.  Pig mask.  And they'll have to blow us in a room in a hotel. 
[00:11:00]  Can we do this?  Yeah.  Sure.  Totally doable.  I know we might be doing something soon.  Maybe we do this.  Totally doable.  We can find a track.  We can make a track wherever we're going to be with lanes, big numbers on their back.  Yeah.  Come on.  Let's do it.  Who would do this?  You think we could get five?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah?  And we could do it in the carny style?  Yeah.  Men and women or just women?  Fuck.  It has to be sloppy.  How were they doing it?  Were they announcing it?  Like, was there a guy announcing it?  It was. 
[00:11:30]  And all their pig names had clever little fucking names.  Like for pigs?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like Oinky?  Oinky, yeah.  Stuff like that.  I don't know.  Curly Tail?  Curly Tail, I think.  Sure.  Something like that.  Oh.  I saw One Heat and I went, yeah, okay.  I've seen it all.  Thank you.  That's all you need.  And I moved on to the sad elephant.  Where was there a state fair?  In the Meadowlands parking lot.  Oh, Jesus.  Jersey's like, look, man.  The sad part is you're seeing that beautiful stadium. 
[00:12:00]  They only use, what, 10 days a year?  Yeah.  They cost, what, a billion dollars to build?  And it just sits there beautifully so they can use it 10, maybe 20 dates a year.  Yeah.  The rest of the time it just sits there.  It's just empty.  And the taxpayers have paid for that.  So the state fair comes to town, how cool would it be if it's inside the stadium?  Yeah.  And it would be plenty of room.  Oh, no, it's in the fucking hot parking lot.  As you stare at the beautiful stadium, it's right there. 
[00:12:30]  State fair.  Right the fuck there is the stadium.  Were there bad rides and stuff?  Nah, it was that kind of state fair.  It was the typical rides.  Wait, where was it?  In the Meadowlands parking lot.  Oh.  Or the Giants flag.  Okay.  Yeah.  Were they those cheesy carnival ride kind of things?  Yeah, the stuff.  Or do they have like a Ferris wheel?  All that shit.  Yeah?  All that shit.  They had that fucking thing that spins all the way around the thing and then it stops  at the top.  They're all puke rides.  Oh, yeah, man.  Every one of them are puke rides. 
[00:13:00]  I didn't go on any rides.  Fuck that.  I went on some rides with my kid, actually.  Is this the Ferris wheel video?  Huh?  You took this?  No, no, no.  I didn't.  Ferris wheel.  There it is.  Oh, God.  That fucking disaster waiting to happen.  They scare me first.  That snapped cable.  That bolt that the fucking meth head didn't tighten.  It's just one bolt away from disaster.  Oh, yes.  And these guys, they have to travel from town to town, breaking this shit down, rebuilding  it.  Yeah.  And like if they don't have a part, like they're not wiring it together with some bailing wire. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  Man, please.  But the sad elephant.  God.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm becoming an animal guy.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you think, well, what would that elephant be doing if they didn't fucking save  it?  You think it would have been fucking killed by now?  It'd probably be in a nice place.  Africa or India?  Yeah.  Look into an elephant's eyes.  Oh, they look so sad.  Oh, my God.  They're all watery.  Oh, my God.  And people are getting elephant rides around like this. 
[00:14:00]  It had to be maybe twice the size of this studio.  Oh, man.  It's just a tight, tight, quick circle with the elephant.  Boy, do I love when they lose their minds.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is pretty much it right here.  Just start stomping everybody.  Oh, man.  This is exactly what I saw.  Oh, my God.  Look at that little space.  Oh, wait.  Is this the state fair that's happening right now?  Okay.  Yeah.  That's exactly what I saw.  And that's the exact elephant.  Look at that big elephant that should be running around on a field somewhere walking with  a fucking...  Like, if he's not there right now, Jets fans will be screaming at each other.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just...  Elephants don't belong in Jersey.  No, they don't belong with a fucking fun hat on.  Unless, of course, they just bought a house there.  They put a little dirt down so he wouldn't hurt his little elephant feet.  His little dumb elephant feet.  Look how sad the whole thing is.  The shitty trainer.  Oh, look at this guy.  All right.  I got to walk around another circle in the heat.  I know he's used to heat and all.  I'm not stupid, but...  Yeah, he's...  Something just seems wrong about this.  Yeah.  The fact that this six-ton animal is carrying fucking just these... 
[00:15:00]  And the people, meanwhile, it's like they're not awful.  They just...  They like the elephant, too.  They just don't understand how shitty they're being by fucking sitting on this big fat pack  to leave him alone.  Let him go home.  Like elephants?  I don't mind safaris that go there and they kind of look at them from a distance.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's great.  Or ride one in its own environment.  It's a little better, I guess.  But not in a shitty parking lot.  Right.  A parking lot... 
[00:15:30]  A hot parking lot in Jersey.  Oh, God.  It was hot.  This poor elephant.  How fun is that?  He's going two miles an hour.  Who enjoys that?  I know.  Look, he looks like a big fucking ball bag.  And you got to think they...  I think they give the elephant a little something-something to keep him calm, too, right?  Because look how slow he's moving.  You think?  Wow, that would...  I think an elephant moves a lot faster than that.  I think the ASPCA really comes down on these motherfuckers and makes sure they're not really  being bad to these things.  I would assume they just give up on some of this stuff and go, all right, look.  Falls through the cracks, these state fairs and stuff. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, that shit's going to happen.  So let's let that be.  We'll try to save something else over here.  Oh, wow.  So I don't know.  I hope they're nicer to them.  Because there's been so much fucking protesting and stuff.  I hope...  No, I mean, the trainer seemed really nice to the elephant.  The elephant's trunk was grabbing the leg and fooling around with the trainer a little  bit.  They seemed to have a rapport.  Oh, yeah?  I don't know.  For those elephants.  He beats him over the head when he fucking gets a little rambunctious.  They've decided to fry everything, deep fry everything at these state fairs. 
[00:16:30]  That's the big thing.  They try to outdo each other.  Right.  Yes, yes.  I saw the famous deep fried Oreo.  I tried that.  That was damn good.  And then, uh...  What did they put on it?  Like, is there a batter first?  Yeah, it's like dough.  Like dough?  What did...  It's like dough dough.  Iraq was there.  What did you see as far as the deep fried shit goes?  Uh, the deep fried bubble gum.  Deep fried bubble gum.  Come on.  Yeah.  Were you there, Iraq? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, I went.  Uh, the deep fried Kool-Aid.  Which took us a while to figure out how they made that.  They just soak the dough in Kool-Aid, like, for the day, and then they fry up the dough.  And then they add extra Kool-Aid.  And then they put, like, powdered sugar on top of it.  It looked horrendous.  Yeah, it's horrible.  It's terrible.  We didn't try it.  Look, new fried Kool-Aid.  New fried Kool-Aid.  That's ridiculous.  Fried Kool-Aid.  That's ridiculous.  Would you try fried Kool-Aid?  I don't know if I'd like it, but I mean...  You gotta try it.  I didn't try it. 
[00:17:30]  I don't know why.  You can't expect to eat healthy at a fair.  I guess you're kind of going, no, you know, it's like, all right, fuck it.  But I don't know if that would appeal to me.  What else was there?  It was bubble gum.  It was the Kool-Aid.  It was the Oreo cookies.  There was another one.  Did they have ice cream?  No, they didn't have ice cream.  That's what I wanted.  Oh.  Why wouldn't the fair have ice cream?  I'm not a deep fried guy.  I would eat ice cream all day long.  Oh, they deep fried Twinkies and then put it covered in strawberry sauce.  Yeah, that I would...  See, the sauce would lose me.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't like sweet, like, fruity sauces.  Like, a little bit I could take.  We should stay away from the parade yesterday. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Fruity sauces.  Splattered into your face.  I guess that was it.  I thought there was more fried shit.  Well, there was a booth that will fry anything that you brought over.  That's like Homer Simpson, yeah.  What did Homer get fried?  Like his car keys or something?  I don't remember.  That's funny.  Or pickles.  Yeah, they had the fried pickles.  Deep fried pickles.  So you could walk over with something and they'll just fry it. 
[00:18:30]  Well, what else they can do?  Deep fry it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  His hat.  The biggest disappointment, and I knew it would be bad, was the fucking sideshow.  I used to fucking rule all that shit growing up.  Yeah.  The politically correct sideshow?  How is that?  It's terrible.  Dude.  That's supposedly the world's smallest woman.  I took a picture.  It's on my stupid Instagram.  I've seen smaller.  And my Twitter.  My Twitter.  She only has one shoe on because her other foot doesn't exist. 
[00:19:00]  Ew.  That's why.  And I took a picture.  It says, take a picture for $1.  Stand up.  I didn't feel like giving her another dollar to have her stand up.  You got to pay her a buck to stand up?  Yeah.  And I was just like, it wasn't a cheap thing.  I'm like, this is just horrendous.  She's in a little cubicle.  But it's weird because you walk around to where she's sitting, the big reveal, and you feel like a complete asshole.  Of course.  You feel like a complete asshole.  I'm like, I'm just fucking looking at how ridiculous you are. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I don't mind it.  That's what it's all about.  But you get this weird feeling like, this is really wrong.  Even I'm thinking that.  Yeah, I guess that's why they did away with these things.  Because you see the box, and then you pay your dollar, and you got to go around.  And then all of a sudden, you see this little thing.  And then you're like, I'm like, hi, how are you?  Does it answer?  Does it answer?  You have a train of there poking her with something?  Talk!  Yeah, talk, you little freak.  And then they try to make it cool by having a nice chair for her, and then she has a picture frame with a bunch of family photos. 
[00:20:00]  That's supposed to make it all cool or something?  That's so you can see she has a full life.  That's right.  They're trying to show you, oh no, she's not just here, this is her job.  Yeah, this is just her job.  Yeah, right.  You know they put her in a shitty little box when they're going from town to town.  But they can't say world's smallest fucking person when she's not even close.  No.  She's a big, fat, fucking small thing.  That's, uh, I don't know, I didn't know how to finish that. 
[00:20:30]  World's smallest.  They're a lot smaller than that.  Not in a fucking sideshow at a state fair of Jersey.  But that was the only one that I could find that was alive.  The rest of them, it's just shitty fake stuff in cases.  No more, that was the only living person there?  Well, the only other guy I saw was a, look, yeah.  The Fiji Island mermaid.  Which is fake.  Big Kev turned me on to the Fiji Island mermaid.  He was there as well.  And, uh, and, uh, he says this is his favorite. 
[00:21:00]  Every year he has to check this out.  The Fiji.  Why?  Watch it deteriorate more and more.  Because it's so ridiculous.  Oh, it's so awful he likes it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fiji Island mermaid.  Great.  It's obviously, like, a sculpture.  I mean, duh.  Yeah, yeah.  It's made out of something.  And it's just in a shitty case.  It's, they talk about, and, you know, you'll see a gorilla.  You know, they have the carny outside, and, and, uh, and there's a giant inside, and a 
[00:21:30]  gorilla, and a, uh, a woman with no head that you could touch her hand to feel how clammy  it is.  So I'm like, all right, I'm going to see some shit, right?  I go in, and it's all dead stuff in cases.  How, what about touching the hand?  Well, that was, you know, they showed the, the headless woman for literally, they had  no confidence in their display.  You got to see it for two seconds.  What did they like?  Here she is!  Okay!  What?  Dude, people were rolling their eyes.  What was it?  It was just some mirror trick. 
[00:22:00]  Oh.  Where she's sitting in this dumb fucking behind the, behind the curtain thing.  And they do the big setup for, like, uh, she lost her head in, uh, on the Autobahn in  a car accident.  They were able to save her, but she has no head.  Are you ready?  And they go, whoosh!  And they go, whoosh!  All right, there she is!  They had no confidence.  Wait, why don't they just leave it open?  Because they, they knew if, if you looked long enough, you'd see how ridiculous it was.  You'd just look and be like, this is bullshit.  Dude, people were walking out, just rolling their eyes, like, we just all, I, I know it's 
[00:22:30]  only a couple bucks, but everyone's like, we were, we're ripped up.  Duped.  But you feel like you got, when was the last time you felt you got ripped off when you  paid for something for a lousy two bucks?  Uh, Whoop-Doo wants to know, did Opie take a trip to 1850?  I know.  It just seems like, dude, I want a fucking, one of these ancient fucking entertainment  Can you film the headless lady?  Uh, can we see the headless lady, Sam?  No cameras, please, no cameras.  I didn't feel like filming anything, it was so ridiculous.  You can take a picture.  No, there's any, if we Google it. 
[00:23:00]  The only other thing was, uh, one of those guys that has, uh, no, uh, lower bottom.  Yeah?  How does he shit?  Huh?  I don't know.  How does he shit?  Oh, he's gotta have a back.  Can you ask him?  He's out for a minute.  Supposedly he's the world's smallest DJ, comes in to introduce one of the acts, he tells some  dumb joke about losing his legs, or not having legs, or born without legs, and then he  leaves.  What the fuck's that?  I don't know, yeah, wouldn't you have him doing tricks all day long?  Yeah.  Handstands?  Anything. 
[00:23:30]  And then I was wondering about him, like, he was born without a penis, like, how does,  what does he feel when he sees a girl, if you don't have a penis?  Probably like the kicker, and then he goes, oh yeah.  Does he really not have a dick?  Dude, he has, he has nothing from the bottom of his ribs down, one of those guys.  You know, the same guy that was on, um, uh, Jerry Springer?  Yeah, where does the shit come out?  I wonder if they have, they must have a lower piece somewhere.  Uh-huh, maybe it's, I don't know.  He obviously has a bag or something, but how is it, when he sees a hot girl, what happens 
[00:24:00]  if you don't have any sex organs?  Oh man, yeah.  Does your brain still go, holy fuck, I want to fuck that?  But if you, if you have no concept of what a penis is or what it does, like, how does  that work in your head?  His sternum starts twitching.  But how does that work?  Does anyone know?  No idea.  I don't know, man.  No idea.  Was Virgil there as the incredible, no one gives a shit about him, man?  Yeah, so, the sideshow.  I have Virgil.  Oh, by the way, the gorilla was some fake gorilla.  They don't even have a real, like, dead gorilla. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  It's a fake one.  No?  In a fucking, um, glass booth.  And people were just rolling their eyes.  That, uh, half the people left before the, before the whole thing was even done.  Just got fed up?  Oh, God, yeah.  How long was it, the free show?  They have one thing where they, they, they, uh, guillotine a woman's head off.  And then the, the carny, like, takes her, the, the head's now in the box.  So then he moves the head over to this, like, kind of chair thing. 
[00:25:00]  It kind of empties the, the head out into the chair.  And, of course, it's sitting there perfectly looking at you.  And then it's time to put the head back in the box.  And he doesn't even, like, doesn't even give it enough effort to make it look like it could possibly, you know, be happening.  And it's just, like, what, she pops her head through or something?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, through the bottom.  That's the guy I saw, yeah, there you go.  Oh, E-Rock did take a picture.  Charlie Sheen.  Yeah, that's the world's smallest DJ.  Oh.  And he has nothing, uh, below his, uh, lower, you know. 
[00:25:30]  Did he only have one arm?  No, I think the arm was, uh.  The other arm is keeping him balanced, like, standing up.  Yeah.  It's like, it's right under him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That shirt is dragging on the floor.  But you only see one arm.  The other one's half stumped.  No, no, it's under his, it's kind of, it's an illusion right there.  He had both hands, uh, arms, trust me, because that's how he walked around the stage.  He was on stage for maybe a minute, maybe two minutes tops.  Jeez.  But I don't know what you're supposed to do with the sideshow, but, I mean, something. 
[00:26:00]  Just laugh and point.  Something.  Ha, ha, ha, look at you, freak.  Yeah.  But everything.  Make it, like, real old school.  Throw, like, tomatoes and cabbage at them.  Well, they still do the pickled punks, but they don't do humans anymore.  So, you know, you have the cav with the two heads, that type of shit in a jar.  That's bullshit.  But the old side shows, that was, like, you know, deformities, you know.  Yeah.  You know, babies with deformities that didn't make it.  And they just throw them in, like, pickle jars.  That's horse shit. 
[00:26:30]  Hence the pickled punk term.  So, I had one of those, and I got rid of mine.  Fuck that.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That karma was a little too much for me.  Yeah.  Can you go to the freak show, grab one, and have it deep fried?  Imagine.  A pickled punk, deep fried, just biting its head off.  Yeah, it was a good night out.  It was different.  How long did you go for?  We were there for, like, four hours.  Oh, you went at night?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  From seven to almost midnight again.  Those places are just creepy to me. 
[00:27:00]  Are they?  It's so archaic.  It's so, like, old school entertainment.  It's just...  I walk around.  I go to walk around.  Oh, my God.  It's great people watching.  Yeah.  Which I love doing.  Yeah.  And it brings you back to being a kid.  For sure.  Yeah, you're like, oh, yeah, I remember doing this as a kid.  Did you play any games and try to win a stuffed animal on the midway?  No.  No?  No, my kid did.  One of the carnies was actually really nice for my kid, which was cool.  Hurry, hurry, hurry.  Step right up.  I saw all the homies.  It's hilarious, man. 
[00:27:30]  And the homies, I don't think they realize that stupid basketball rim is fucking bent.  Oh, it's oval.  And I just sat there watching a guy just...  It must have been a hundred bucks.  Oh.  And you know on the playground this guy is something.  And he had his woman around and other women around.  And there was a whole thing.  And he just kept going and going.  And I said to myself, holy fuck, this guy has no idea the rim is fucking bent.  He couldn't figure it out.  You know, because obviously when you look at it, it's an optical illusion.  Yeah, yeah.  And all I had to do, this one basketball thing was set on the side, so you could actually 
[00:28:00]  walk around to something else.  And you could see from the side angle that they're bent.  Yep.  Bent to the point where it's almost impossible to make that shot.  It's probably a fucking quarter inch bigger than the basketball.  Oh yeah, you gotta have a perfect fucking shot to make it.  And this guy just couldn't understand why he couldn't hit it.  Dude, it had to be 20 or 30 balls he did.  Had to be.  It's like when they have those games too with the darts where you gotta hit the balloons 
[00:28:30]  with the darts.  And I'm pretty fucking good at darts.  But they would bend the shaft of the dart.  Is that all it is?  It doesn't fly straight and they grind down.  Yeah, it's a slight bend, but enough.  And then they grind down the tips so they're not even pointy anymore.  But then also they don't fill up the balloons enough so it bounces off.  Yeah, they make them very, very, yeah, cushiony.  All for shitty fucking stuffed animals.  For crappy stuffed animals, right.  Right. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, you're not even winning anything that great.  And it's like, yeah, they show the big, nice stuffed animal.  And that's only if you win three times in a row doing that.  And then you do hit, like, three balloons.  Right.  And you're like, oh, I'm gonna get a big animal.  Right.  No, you get this little shitty one.  Yeah.  And then you could trade in three of those for a bigger one.  Right.  It's just stupid.  And these parties are sitting there on their microphones just trying to get people to  play.  The place was pretty packed.  Yeah.  But I think everyone's like, no, man, this sucks. 
[00:29:30]  They gotta refigure that shit out, too.  Everyone knows that they're just fucking...  You gotta have some winners.  Suckers.  Suckers.  You gotta have some winners.  I wonder when someone finally wins the balloon thing, if maybe they have just maybe one or  two darts that are just sharp and ready to fucking go.  Yeah, good ones.  Where they go, okay, it's time.  We need a winner now.  So, all right, here.  Yeah.  You know, they hand it over to a guy they think could do it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'd like to know a little more about that shit.  But those guys, you could tell they're big fucking partiers, those cornies. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  Their whole lives are just a disaster.  So, I think that's about it for the State Fair.  My God, man.  How big was it?  Like, how long could you walk around before you hit the same thing?  Four hours.  I don't...  I mean, if you're, like, checking out shit, yeah, they had the original Batcopter from  the Batman movie, the made-for-TV movie.  I love that.  It's like, who cares? 
[00:30:30]  It was there, though.  Such who-gives-a-shit stuff.  But they were giving people rides.  How crazy...  Would you go...  In a helicopter?  It's like the one from...  It's those tiny fucking helicopters.  Yeah.  It's like the ones in M.A.S.H.  Yeah, there it is.  Where they bring the bodies in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  An old fucking...  But they're saying it's the original helicopter from the Batman series-slash-made-for-TV movie.  They also said there's a headless woman in the freak show.  Yeah, they did lie a lot.  Yeah.  They said it would be entertaining for all of us. 
[00:31:00]  But that's, like...  That thing is over 30 years old.  How high up did they go?  They weren't flying, because it was, I don't know, the guy decided he wanted to walk around  the fair with his wife or something.  I don't know.  I don't want to fly.  I got...  Because Big Kev was thinking of going up in one of those...  That's why he's not flying.  He saw Big Kev coming around.  You just hear, ka-chunk, and he takes off, and the bottom of the helicopter and Kev are  still sitting on the lot.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  There's two skid marks on the fucking pavement where it didn't get off the ground. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, man.  You wouldn't go up in a helicopter that's 30 years old?  At a fucking...  30.  That thing is probably...  More than 30, right?  1950.  30 is now...  You've got to...  Wow, 30 is the 80s.  Yeah.  So, yeah, it's got to be almost 40 years old then, right?  1966.  Then why were they saying 30?  That's 34 about before you get to the turn of the century.  That's 46 years ago.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  Would you go up in that?  No, right?  That is like the one in MASH. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Wow.  What a fucking little house on the prairie weekend you had there.  The State Fair.  Going to Sleepy Eye to go see the State Fair.  It was different.  It was all right.  I wouldn't go every year or anything like that.  Yeah.  Then they had some just country band playing to like nobody as we were leaving.  That sounds great.  At midnight.  I felt bad for those guys.  They sounded, I guess, like they were good.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Midnight?  You stayed till? 
[00:32:30]  7.30 to, yeah, about midnight.  Wow.  Yep.  Just wandering around.  I hate those places.  Huh?  They just, I don't like fairs and carnivals and things.  Give me the heebie-jeebies, especially at night.  Why?  You think some shit's going to go down?  I don't know.  I just don't like those places.  They're scary and depressing.  But why?  You're being too vague.  I don't know.  It's an irrational kind of just a feeling I get around those places.  Maybe I was fucking, maybe I was dicked in the ass at one. 
[00:33:00]  We were trying to figure out the black woman at the state fair.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Maybe some of the black ladies could call.  I think black women, I think they, I think they feel like they look good fat.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, it's been this fucking, that's been thrown at us for fucking, it's been thrown  at us through the media and through TV and shit like that for years that I look good.  So if they see, this is what we were trying to figure out. 
[00:33:30]  If they see like a skinny, in-shape white girl, do they laugh?  Yeah.  Because skinny white girls were laughing at them like, what the fuck?  Because they, no, I, oh my God, they had no clothes on, man.  They were walking around like in, uh.  Hoochie Mama.  They love spaghetti strap tank tops that don't fit.  That don't fit.  They had like pajama pants on.  They had their underwear popped out.  They had their bras strapped showing.  And they are so fucking flabby, man.  They, and they love the fact that they think they look good. 
[00:34:00]  But they're wearing it like, I look, yeah, thanks.  Yeah.  They wear it like, no, man, I am the sexiest thing here.  No one.  It's such a cult, it has to be a cultural thing.  It is.  Because I don't understand it.  It is.  And tight white spandex pants.  It's this thick diva thing.  They think they're divas because they're fat.  And then look at that.  That is fucking.  That's pretty much disgusting.  And she's not as bad as I've seen a lot of chicks.  Oh, I've seen some really bad.  She's at least pretty. 
[00:34:30]  She pretty much was walking around the state fair this one.  Pretty much.  It was sort of like that.  Bellies hanging out.  Because, you know, it was tank tops and half shirts with these massive bellies.  What the fuck?  And the big butt and the little, Jesus, the massive teabags sticking out.  Teabag.  From behind.  Wow.  Fascinating.  It really was.  Fucking A.  That is just the weirdest thing.  I don't know.  I don't know what that's about.  Maybe we could try to figure that out today on the show. 
[00:35:00]  I don't get it.  I mean, I don't understand the attraction to it.  Patrice loved it, though.  Like, even though his chick was hot, he would always defend girls like that.  He would go, oh, delicious.  He loved the big rump.  Juicy.  Juicy.  Yeah.  Big rump, yeah, but.  He loved that shit.  Big fat chick I just can't do, man.  No one wants a juicy.  It's not even like they're, they're just, they're just sloppy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not even that they're really that fat.  They're big.  Well, sloppy.  Yeah.  That's a good word for it.  But they're, the word is more sloppy. 
[00:35:30]  They're sloppy.  There's some extra pounds on them.  But there's guys that love that.  Like, that's their thing.  Oh, I know.  They walk, they were walking around like, no, this is completely accepted and I know I look good.  And I'm sitting there as a dopey white guy going, wow, I can't wrap my head around that.  I look good.  So I wonder if they think that about white women.  I know in the Bronx that there's considered, like, a lot of the Spanish women that get, like, put a few pounds on.  Yeah.  That's like a badge of honor for the guy.  Like, if your chick's a little thick.  It's not like, they don't look at it like white guys do, where it's like, ah, she put on 10 pounds. 
[00:36:00]  Like, after a baby or something.  Right.  They look at that like a lot of those guys like that.  So if there's a skinny black broad, what's that about?  They laugh at her, Sam?  Yeah, it's not good.  How do you know this shit?  I've never hung out with black people before.  They like a big ass, but all black guys don't go for that.  Not at all, no.  Well, what do you know?  That's what Jim was saying.  They like a thicker girl, a lot of people.  Especially, like, deep in the communities. 
[00:36:30]  You know what I mean?  Why, though?  It's just what it is.  As a white guy, you don't want that.  I don't know.  It's like...  As a white guy, you want something kind of in shape.  Yeah, no, they don't like skinny girls at all.  That's so weird of me.  But the high-profile athletes and actors never have a fatso on their arm.  Almost never.  Look at all these guys.  They always have a hot, slim chick, so...  Right.  Right.  What's that about, huh?  Speaking of athletes, what did Amari say?  What did he tweet about that?  Well, I'm actually just Twittered, so I'm glad it's on the front page, because there's 
[00:37:00]  a shot cop on page four.  But page one is Amari, how do you say his name, Stoudemeyer?  Oh, Stoudemeyer.  Or Stoudemeyer.  Yeah, he plays for the Knicks.  He did what we do.  Somebody insulted him on Twitter.  Right.  And so he sent a DM to the guy, a fucking direct, private message.  He called the guy a faggot.  Ah, I see.  And it's front page, because of course the guy reposted it.  Wait, first of all, the cop story is on page four.  We had a cop, like they said, shot in the Bronx six years. 
[00:37:30]  After his brother, six years after his brother was shot.  So that's a massive story, and they put Stoudemeyer on the...  These papers are fucking ridiculous.  He called him a faggot.  A faggot.  He said faggot.  He said...  In a DM.  In a DM.  That's private shit.  Yep.  Your Twitter is not private, but when you DM people, that's private shit.  Twitter slur on Gay Pride Day.  Oh my God.  Yeah, like they just are so desperate to go for the fucking...  The...  What would you even call this angle?  It's the... 
[00:38:00]  It's the nonsense.  It's a non-story.  Yeah, yeah.  Who cares?  What was the beef or whatever?  How did it start?  The guy, you know, just being a fan or whatever, was a...  Kind of said something dickish.  He said something about...  He tweeted...  His guy's name is Brian Farrell, or Farrelly, that Amari had better come back a lot stronger  and quicker to make up for this past season.  Now...  He didn't have a bad year, by the way.  But I guess that just annoyed...  I think he should have...  He could have had a better year, certainly.  It just annoyed Stoudmire, and he said... 
[00:38:30]  He sent him a direct message...  Yeah.  Saying, fuck you.  I don't have to do anything fag...  Either fag or faggot, because of course they won't say the F word.  Right.  Hey, you put it on your front page.  Why don't you...  Yes, I am.  Why don't you be brave enough to fucking put it in print?  Right.  Fuck, I hate this fucking world.  Yeah.  This is a weird world we live in.  Good job on the daily news.  That's the important front page story, is that a basketball player said either fag or faggot  in a private message to a fan.  Right.  Who gives a fuck? 
[00:39:00]  Right.  And everyone uses those words, you dopes.  Oh, God.  I would bet money even the guy that wrote the story for the Daily News has said it in private.  Who would look at that?  They just think, oh, this will stir up a little outrage.  Yeah, they love outrage.  Well, you know what?  I'm guilty, because I saw that.  I didn't even know it was a direct message.  Jimmy, until you just said it.  Yeah.  Because I saw the front page, like, oh, wow, okay.  Yeah, we do that all the time.  I usually just bash them and say that they've had oral sex with their father and shit like 
[00:39:30]  that.  But, um...  Wow.  And he sent out a quick Twitter apology.  Hey, man, sorry, bro.  I just got off a plane.  So I wasn't thinking...  Did a DM.  Oh, he DMed an apology, even?  To the guy.  But the guy still went forward with a private message to the press?  Well, then the guy...  That's pathetic.  No, this was after what happened.  No, no.  The guy had posted it, and then Amare sent him a DM.  Hey, sorry, bro.  No excuses.  It won't happen again.  A quick...  He handled it okay.  Like, again, in that world, there's millions of dollars at stake. 
[00:40:00]  Say you're sorry and move on.  I don't fault you.  Like, whatever.  Yeah, he has left.  I guess why he has to say you're sorry, but it's not even the guy posting it.  Like, I almost don't even...  Like, if I bashed an athlete and he called me a fag, I'd post it, too.  Right.  It's like, hey, look at this guy.  Like, I always assume my DM shit will get posted, or I always say stuff that I know can be posted.  Right, exactly.  It's the paper putting on the front page.  Yeah, what the hell's that about?  People say fag, and they say faggot. 
[00:40:30]  Even gay fucking guys say fag and faggot.  I was watching the news over the weekend, and I guess because of Gay Pride Week, they were trying to show how far things have come.  And they showed a daily news cover from...  It had to be maybe 1968, 69, somewhere around there.  And the headline was, Homo Nest Raided, Queen B's Screaming Mad, or something. 
[00:41:00]  Homo Nest.  They raided a homo nest.  And here they are, and here they are, fucking 40 years later, still playing on people's obsession with homosexuality.  Now they've just changed tactics.  That's all.  Right.  Queen B's Stinging Mad.  Homo Nest Raided.  Queen B's are stinging mad.  Did they just used to raid places where gay guys were? 
[00:41:30]  I don't know.  And just arrest them?  They would just arrest them for being gay?  A homo nest.  A homo nest.  Kind of sounds fun, doesn't it?  A nest of homos.  Go to the homo nest.  Big fat stingers jabbing you.  Homo nest.  Oh, God.  We've come a long way.  Yeah.  Let's all relax.  We've come a long way.  Exactly.  That's what gets me.  We're good.  We're good right here.  That's what gets me.  We don't need to keep going. 
[00:42:00]  They just keep going and make it sound like there's so much injustice in this world.  And that goes with every friggin' group.  Every one of these fucking groups that have to have an organization.  They still talk like there's just injustice at every corner.  Yeah.  And meanwhile, look back a little.  See how far things have come.  And, you know, you're doing fine.  Let it ride now.  Everyone's doing fine.  Everyone's still outraged.  Outraged at the word fag.  Stop it. 
[00:42:30]  Well, I didn't even know it was a DM.  Man, that's ridiculous.  That is.  Whatever.  Did you partake in any of the gay pride festivities this weekend in Manhattan?  Big gay pride parade down there.  I was going to do the cellar last night, but I'm like, to go down there on gay pride or Halloween?  It's crazy.  Yeah.  I was afraid that the traffic would be horrible.  I was just like crossing over 6th Avenue to get down to the fucking village in a nightmare.  Yeah.  So I was like, I just canceled.  I was like, I know it's going to be.  It's probably good people watching.  Dude, I kind of wish I would have went. 
[00:43:00]  I've never actually gone to the parade, but I would like to go one day and just watch  it happen.  They were all over Manhattan.  It wasn't even just down by the parade and stuff like.  After the parade stopped, there was a shitload in Times Square.  I didn't see them in Central Park.  A lot of gays all over the place.  Was there a lot of riots or fucking fights?  No.  It's amazing.  People don't like gays, but when they get together like that, you don't have.  There's no violence.  No, there's nothing ever going on.  A bunch of people just fucking being loud and making silly noises.  Flamboyant.  Yeah.  A lot of rainbow clothes.  What a great night for Tranny watching. 
[00:43:30]  God damn it.  I'm so mad I was home.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of that.  We should have sent someone down there.  A lot of men holding hands walking down the street.  We failed as a radio show.  I didn't even know it was this past weekend.  I didn't either.  We should have fucking had people.  We failed as a radio show, and I failed as a you-know-what.  Oh, boy.

[00:49:30]  When did he die  I was just about to say that  When did he live and die  Probably in the 80s right  No  He made it to the 90s you think  1980  When was he born  75  1893  1893  He was born in the 1800s  He made it to 87  With a serious alcohol problem 
[00:50:00]  Wow  Can I ask one of the interns for more coffee  Since now Kenny's not allowed to ask them anymore  I have to go through E-Rock  And I don't want to wait until breaks  Wait what happened now  Wow  Well I think we're all  E-Rock's in charge of them so  Kenny's not allowed to tell the interns  I don't know if he is or not  E-Rock what's going on  There's so many stupid rules here so  You think there's stupid rules here  Some of them are yeah  So I just want to  I don't know  Kenny  Are you allowed to tell the interns  Or ask them for coffee if we ask for it  No I'm forbidden to speak to interns 
[00:50:30]  So  Why  What happened  What happened  You never hit an intern  Or did anything terrible to an intern  No but  What happened  Somebody knows what they did  If they want to come forward and say  Oh  Who  There was an intern  That got hired  Who lived in a shoe  Sal  But haven't we talked about this before or not  Yes  Okay  So usually if I get a request  I  The chain of command is  I go to Eric  And then Eric dispatches the interns 
[00:51:00]  Okay well from now on  I'll just do it on the air  Because I'm not waiting  Right  So can I have a coffee from an intern  Sorry I apologize to the listeners  But why  We haven't still figured out  Why Kenny can't talk to the interns  Like what  Why  The Sal incident  Turned into  You can't talk to interns  Right  Right  What was the incident  I forget  The interns are  Beyond my span of control  Eric is their boss  Yeah  Eric's their boss  Why can't you  Technically you're not  Ordering them to do something  You're just relaying something for me  Because E-Rock's in the booth  I'll text Kenny 
[00:51:30]  More coffee please  And I would want him to tell the intern  Because this way  So wait  If Jimmy wants coffee  He'll text you  Then you have to tell E-Rock  And then E-Rock tells the intern  Correct  Typical corporate type of thing  It's exactly  Middle management  They're not doing us any favors  By allowing us to have interns  By the way  Can I know  Not under these rules  Can I know the Sal situation  Thing that happened  What happened  Well  Sal decided to go into the booth  Because I think he's scared of you  When Sal was an intern  Yeah  Alright  He was elevated to a position of honor and trust 
[00:52:00]  With handling the talent  Uh huh  You know  You know  Necessities  Right  And he complained  That he was overworked  Oh  Yes  Wait  Did he complain to  Down the hall people  Well  If I remember correctly  Maybe Travis wants to come forward  Yeah  Because  Somebody brought it to  Down the hall's attention 
[00:52:30]  I think Travis went to Gary  Travis talked about it  I think that Kenny was  Salent to Travis  Yeah you don't remember this  Interesting  We did this whole thing  Maybe  Will you hear that then  I don't remember anything  Um  Yeah and instead of  You know  Travis  You know  You know  Not airing our dirty laundry  And you know  Talking to me  Oh boy  Oh boy  So then  They came to you  And said  Why didn't they just say  Hey it's your fucking job 
[00:53:00]  Not you  But you like to sell  Why didn't they say  Hey stop bitching  Anthony you know  They're very hypersensitive  They certainly are  They're compassionate  Who  Serious  You know  Human relations  People  Human relations  No what was happening  Was they said  Human cyborg relations  They asked  He complained  Because I think  He was doing production  And they liked the production  He was doing  But he was like  How come nobody else  Is being sent out  That was what he said  The position of trust  And honor  That's correct 
[00:53:30]  Was shunned  Where's Sal  Does he want to say something  I thought we were past all this  There's many  It's Sal  I thought this came up on air  And we moved past this  I guess not  Apparently it's still an issue  It's a precedent that was set  I'm just irritated  That I can't just text Kenny  And say can I have some more coffee  Hey Sal  Here's the fucking rat  Kenny doesn't talk to you  What happened  Me and Kenny  We talk now  What happened  You're good  Yeah we're good  I'm a mean guy  What happened  You had to stir some shit up  Do you understand this show 
[00:54:00]  We did this before though  I don't remember doing this  Me neither  I don't remember this  We did this  We did this  And it was  I was doing all the work  Yeah  And then  Was I here when we did this  Yes  Oh boy  I don't remember this at all  We didn't  We asked Sal if he went to Gary  But Travis had gone to Gary  No I understand the nature  Of who I need to go to  And stuff like that  If there's an issue  How about you  You were an intern at the time  It's your fucking job  It was  How about that 
[00:54:30]  You're right  No you're absolutely right  Wow  What were you cranky  Fucking ragging that day  Were you on your period  Yeah I probably was  Your cramps  What the fuck  No it's just we  Like I remember you guys  Jesus Christ  I didn't want that  Son of a bitch  That other intern  I can't remember his name  The guy who argued with everybody  And then we got new interns  And I figured well  You know  They're capable people  They can go out as well  Do you realize you fucked it all up though  Because now Kenny can't even talk to the interns  Well I apologize 
[00:55:00]  Sal forgot about his second intern responsibility  Shut the fuck up  Shut the fuck up  That is an intern responsibility  Yeah  Well apparently the new interns  Don't know that responsibility either  What are they doing  Sam can expound on this  Or expand  Is expound a word  I guess it is  Expound  Kenny was unhappy  With one of the interns  Because it was Kevin  The intern who I was talking to  About what everybody does at the show  Right  I asked him if he had spoken to Kenny  And he  Because I asked him to speak to everybody 
[00:55:30]  To find out  And I asked him if he had spoken to Kenny  And he said no  And I said why not  And he said I don't like to talk to Kenny  Because he's mean  Oh boy  And Kenny didn't like that  Well you know what  How about it's great training  For when you get a job  And your boss is fucking mean  And he's an asshole  How about I never said two words  To the cocksucker  He's opening his mouth about me  Bravo  I'm forbidden to speak to the interns  So that makes me mean  Yeah  Yeah  See this just gets really fucked up 
[00:56:00]  When they've got to put their hands in it  They just can't get enough  I didn't mean to open a whole thing  I'm just annoyed  Can of worms  Yeah  I was going to say that  And I just decided not  To  But from now on  I'm just going to ask on air  When I want coffee  Now I can immediately tell them  And it's not to annoy the listeners  But this is what we have to deal with  It's the same shit  They have to deal with their job  Same fucking nonsense  But it doesn't matter James  Because then  Eric has to come get the credit card  For me anyway  So you might as well  Oh man  Whatever it is 
[00:56:30]  I want it faster  Does I rock  Go off on a power trip  With this whole thing  Does he like being ahead of it  No he hates it  No you don't like being ahead of the interns  He likes it  King of the interns  Is the intern out already  Not for your coffee  Intern out  Because they're waiting for my credit card  Holy  We're giving them cash  What the fuck are we doing  Let's just move  How hard is this  Nobody wants to outlay the cash  Holy shit  I just want coffee  That's all  Actually I'll go in the back  Get my coffee  I'll get  Fucking  Fucking  Dance over there 
[00:57:00]  And get my fucking coffee  I'll get in the back  I'll get in the  I want flavored coffee  But it's fucking  That's the red tape  It's so annoying  The credit card went from Sal  To E-Rock  To the intern  Aren't you allowed to hand the fucking  Credit card to the intern  Yeah I am  I am  Why does everything have to be complicated  Just fucking  Why is there a protocol  For every fucking thing  That's 20 layers of bullshit  To get to do one thing  Well who's responsible  Gary 
[00:57:30]  Where's Gary  Man  I don't think  It's him though right  I don't know if it's him  Or if it's just the fucking corporate culture  It's like he's just  If he doesn't say that  Somebody else will  It's like he doesn't  It's just  It's this thing  It's this fucking thing  This entity  It is a thing  You can't put your  You can't put your  Because if it's not Gary  You can't put your finger on an individual  Yeah he doesn't  In this corporate structure  We don't know  Who causes all this  Shit  It's always just 
[00:58:00]  Yeah upstairs  They point to the ceiling tiles  And go well you know  You know them  What  Who  Where  Eric  You like being the boss  Of the interns  It's not a position  I would have  Volunteered to take  No huh  You should have told him  Go fuck themselves then  Did he get a raise to do that  No I did not  Then tell him  You're not in charge  Of the interns anymore  What's wrong with you  King of the interns  See everybody takes  Why would you take  Why would you take  More responsibility on  Without getting more money  Because he's afraid  Of being fired  It's one more thing  That you feel  Makes you valuable  To the company  It's like being essential 
[00:58:30]  To the war effort  When you have one arm  And you're shoveling snow  That's how we all  Look at it here  I'm essential  To the war effort  If Eric's a supervisor  He should get  Supervisor's pay  He rocks list  He's an average visor  He already does  Get supervisors pay  I want you  A supper visor  I want you to quit  Right now  Not the show  But quit as the  The boss of the interns  Put your foot down 
[00:59:00]  But there's nobody else  Not too hard  Who can take care  Of the interns  It doesn't matter  Let them figure it out  Down the hall  Go look  You're not paying me extra  To be in charge of the interns  So I quit  That part of my job  You know what Troy's  Theory was about  Iraq getting the intern position  He said it on the after show  That he believes  That they gave Iraq  The extra responsibility  Because they're looking  For anything  For Eric to do  To fill his enormous  Pay scale  That he's receiving  They're just looking  To justify  Troy thinks he fell  Through the cracks  Yeah  Troy believes that 
[00:59:30]  The company  Is looking  It's not justified  How much money  They're paying him  No  Now they're trying  To make up  For all that money  So they're trying  To figure out  What he can possibly do  Iraq you make weird friends  Man  Aren't you friends  With this Troy cat  I thought so  Yeah  He did say that though  Right  No he did say that  Has he ever been  To Castlenagel  Not yet  No  When are you having  People over  Because I think  I'm away when you are  Or me and Sam  Must be gone  He specifically did  At Comic Con weekend  So they're  He did right  I figured that  I asked him to reschedule  He said absolutely not  Okay  So  Alright 
[01:00:00]  So Iraq  Just quit  You don't need that shit  You should dude  They're not paying you extra  So quit right now  And let Gary try to figure it out  Or then maybe Gary will go  Alright look you're right  I'll give you a few extra bucks  Yeah that ain't happening  So quit  If I quit it'll turn into  How this was all my fault  To begin with  So  But they're not paying you extra  To do extra responsibilities  If I just keep this  Is that too much for you there Sal  Too much  You able to fucking bring that in  You alright 
[01:00:30]  You need a break  A rest or something  This is almost not fair though  We beat the shit out of him  We got through this one  Yeah I know  We really did  It's fine  Where were you  But Kenny's still punting  He took a massive beating  For this whole thing  It's fine  It's totally cool  Like I was being a bitch  And you guys handed it to me about it  So it's fine  See he admitted all sorts of shit  I know  Took responsibility  Travis got involved  It was a whole thing  Can I just say one thing too  Kevin said that  Kenny is mean to the interns  And that is  That is absolutely not true  Kenny has no interaction 
[01:01:00]  Yeah Kenny has no interaction with him  So where is this kid  He's getting food  But the problem  When he's back  The problem is  When you meet Kenny for the first time  You don't know  How to handle it  Yeah  I'll tell you  Kenny has Asperger's  He doesn't mean to  I didn't like Kenny  When I first met him  And by first met him  I meant the first two years  I was on the road  But you don't  Once you  Get to know him  But he does not make  A pleasant first impression  Oh god  He could be the worst at that  Yeah his first impression  Really isn't good 
[01:01:30]  When me and Florentine  I've told this story before  Me and Florentine  Went to Rascals West Orange  To see Dice  And Andrew had said  Kai come see me  We knew he'd be happy  To see us  Yeah  We had to of course  Oh god  Go through that  Go through Kenny  So he said  Hey could you go in the back  And tell Dice  That Jim and Jim are here  And he goes  Jim and Jim  And then he walks in the back  And we can hear him  He goes  Jim and Jim  Are here to see you  Oh god  But Andrew goes  Oh and he was happy  To see us  So we went back  How obnoxious  Is that the kid  We were having fun laughing 
[01:02:00]  God look at his  Velour head  And fucking five minutes  Into it Kenny goes  Okay  These guys  They have to leave  And we didn't have to go  And Dice goes  Where are you going  And we're like  We don't have to go  So we stayed longer  You were trying  To kick them out  Yes  You were trying  To kick them out  Yeah but I understood  He was trying to  Because Dice  Might be polite  It's not easy being me  No  Oh despicable me  You're the bad guy  Now what is your name sir  I'm Kevin  Okay I've seen you around 
[01:02:30]  I haven't heard you talk  On the air or anything yet  We did a whole bit with him  Oh you did  You did  What bit  The thing  What thing  He doesn't remember  Oh yeah  He did a whole bit with him  Getting mad at him  For no reason  Did they just pump  Nitrous oxide  No you know why  I wasn't  When I did that  I remember doing that  It was a joke  But I didn't remember his face  Because he was off to my side  Oh okay  I wasn't even looking at him  I was just yelling  Right right  It was the yelling thing  So I'm surprised  I didn't get any trouble  From upstairs for that  Oh yeah  Look out  No comedic bits  With the interns 
[01:03:00]  Yeah there's no reason  To have interns here anymore  Because we're not allowed  To do anything with them  By the way  Look who's in here  To see if anything goes awry  Iraq  Iraq is  This is his responsibility  Are you supervising right now  Iraq  Yes  For the people  That didn't hear last time  When interns are in studio  Iraq has to come in studio  And Sal's in the booth  And supervise  It's like this really weird click  It's like the  The cog turns one direction  Iraq in  Sal in  Intern in  Everyone's in position  Yeah  Yeah  Quit as supervisor of the interns 
[01:03:30]  Please  Just walk away  You look ridiculous  You're standing there  With your arms folded  Making sure nothing happens in here  Quit  No he likes this  Because he doesn't  Have to do anything right now  Yeah yeah  Please quit this  In there he's afraid  He's going to do the wrong thing  Oh forget it  Go it's too much responsibility  Unless you're willing to give me  A little bump up in money  I can't do this anymore  That's what I would say  That's what we're going to say  Yeah  Yeah  Please  Please  Go for it  Come on Iraq  Just quit on air  Well let's see how this 
[01:04:00]  Interaction goes first  You don't want to be  Supervising interns  Don't be a pussy dude  Because that means  You're going to have to  Try to tell us  Not to do something  With the intern  That's never going to work  You know that  It'll be fun to try  You know that  Hey intern guy  Yes  What about Kenny  Why did you say he's mean  I said he just wasn't nice  I said he just wasn't nice  I said he just  That's not what you said  Tell the truth  That's what I meant  Well what did you say  But what did you say though  Just for the record  He just wasn't  Nice guy to the interns 
[01:04:30]  Well that's not what you said  What's an example  He said Kenny  Like he just doesn't seem  Friendly to us  Like he seems friendly  To everyone else  It just kind of seems like  He's  Why would he want to be  Friendly to you though  Why do you even deserve  Friendliness  Being an intern  Do you need Kenny  To be friendly to you  You just are supposed  To fucking do shit  But wait  He's probably saying  He comes in every morning  And what he doesn't like  He doesn't interact with you  No he just  Good morning  How was your weekend  What is he supposed to  Hi  Like a general like  Oh boy  It's the bullying culture 
[01:05:00]  Oh  See  It's not bullying at all  Is club sort of Kenny  Bullying you  It's just  God  You're not going to  But wait a minute now  Hold on  You need to bring back  The sweatshop  Kenny has been told  Not to  Mean  But you don't  But you don't know  What we've gone through  Before  Where Kenny was told  Not to interact  With the interns  So Kenny doesn't  Interact with the interns  He takes us to the extreme  Well Kenny's not helping  Right now  As he stares him down  Kenny what did he say  He said I was mean  And now  Now he's  He's looking for  Some wiggle room  Right  He's looking for 
[01:05:30]  Some wiggle room  I think  I think that he said  Kenny was mean  Because Kenny doesn't  Talk to him  Not realizing that  Kenny doesn't talk to him  Because he's not  Allowed to talk  And Kenny doesn't  Really talk to anyone  But he's a robot  He'll always say  Good morning  I mean  Do you say good morning  To him  When we first started  We were told  We shouldn't talk to him  Unless we were  Properly introduced  Holy shit  Who told you that  Sam told you that  I want a name  Iraq  I'm not the intern boss  Iraq what was that about  Well based on 
[01:06:00]  Past experiences  With interns  All the new interns  Are advised  To not bother  Kenny or interact  With Kenny  Until one eye  Introduce them  Stop saying bother  Because nobody  Bothers Kenny  No  No one  There's not a person  On this earth  That could bother  No there's been  Some interns  That'll just go over  Because Kenny's  Standing out there  They'll just go over  And try to  Talk to him about  But you see all this shit  It's like  Who cares  Can't we just  This is an easy job  It should be a fun  Fucking gig  Like all this  Nonsense  Don't  Don't interact 
[01:06:30]  With Kenny  Until you're introduced  I can't send him  Without the credit card  What the fuck happened  This is a fun job  Yeah  I don't know  Hey man can I get some coffee  I'm doing something  Get him  Okay  How hard is that  It's  What it is  Is middle management  Justifying their jobs  By making up things  To do  Like so they could then say  Oh yeah I did this  I put this in place  I enacted this  I'm surprised we're able  To do a radio show  At this point  With all the red tape  Oh my god  Unbelievable  By the way  Our track record 
[01:07:00]  With interns  Because I heard that  Mentioned  Has been amazingly good  Considering the type of show  We do  And considering the shit  We've done over the years  We had one almost incident  That's it  For the one incident  We all know that  We had one lousy  Almost incident  And it wasn't on the air  And in the end  It was fine  And you were able  That's after  Well over ten years  Of doing crazy shit  With interns  And plus  You were able to staff  Your entire radio show  With the internship program  Right  But one incident  That was fine 
[01:07:30]  In the end  So our track record  Actually is really good  Yeah no problems  Will you quit  As the supervisor  Of the interns  You really are a pussy  Dude don't be a pussy  You're not even getting  Fuck up  That sucks  Kenny at some point  Could you tell E-Rock  To tell one of the interns  That I need another cup of ice  Yes  Wait do it now on air  Let's see how this goes down  Yeah  Eric Anthony  Would like a cup of ice  Okay Kenny  Connor could you go to the kitchen 
[01:08:00]  And get a cup of ice  Make sure there's a lid on it  For Anthony  Thank you  Don't put your hands in it  It should be full  Fill it to the top  Don't spit in it  Thank you  Oh my god  This is just  Quit  Not the show  Just as the supervisor  Of the interns  What's wrong with you  You got enough shit  On your plate  Make Gary come in here  Every way shape or form  Make Gary come in here  And supervise these guys  That's because you really want that  I don't give a fuck  You want him around here all the time  We barely see the guy  Who cares  He still wouldn't be here all the time  Exactly  You got a lot going on bro 
[01:08:30]  You're gonna take this shit  Busy guy  I thought they gave you  At least a little money for this  Nah  That's bullshit  There's no money at this time  Quit  You got worse  Is that fucking mortgage  Getting paid over there  It's gotta be a hefty nut  Quit  Running the board in here  What about  If they can't give you money  You get compensatory time off  What's that  Compensatory time off  Can you know some big words  What was the word you used  On the way home the other day  I was amazed  Do you want to open that whole can of worms now 
[01:09:00]  Why  A lot of cans of worms being opened  Well I got a talking to  Oh right  Yeah  Yeah  He got a talking to  Because in an email  Fuck this  Who gives a fuck  This is great  I don't even know  If we're gonna be here  In a couple months  What gives a fuck  There's a situation  That's going on  Where we're working on a thing  And Kenny's working on  The details of the thing  And in one of his emails  He used the word  And they got really mad  Because of the word he used  What was the word?  Is that about right?  I'm trying to keep it vague 
[01:09:30]  Yeah  Did you guys have to do with traveling?  I think  It's a possibility  The word was acquiesce  He got in trouble  For using the word acquiesce  They got  By the way  I'm bringing this up on the air  Because now  Now it's gonna be a problem  That we're even talking about  What did you say?  Well  You know  Could you use it in a sentence?  I said the talent  Origin  Open acquiesce  See  That's you guys  The talent will acquiesce  To a certain amenity  All right  Right  And I got a talking to 
[01:10:00]  About the use of that word  Because  Sirius  Never refused  The talent  That amenity  So you're not acquiescing  To anything  You're volunteering  But  This is what they fucking  Paw over  He got a talking to  Big time  About using that word  So that's why  I beat the shit out of Gary  Every time I see him  Because I know the shit  He pulls in these guys  When we're not here  So fuck that guy  Because it's probably  On like permanent record  In an email 
[01:10:30]  So they don't want  Anything  Misconstrued  Right  Like that you guys  Are doing them a favor  Acquiesce  So I said  All right  Then just give them  The amenity  Right  Well you didn't ask  For the amenity  So now he has to  Go back to finance  To see if that amenity  Can be approved  I go  So they  You know  In essence  They are acquiescing  He got mad at you  For using that word  Because now he'll tell me 
[01:11:00]  After the show  We didn't get mad at that  At all  No but  They made a specific point  To sit me down  And talk to me  About the use of that word  Every time we have  These discussions  All I can think of  Is a stopwatch  Of how much longer  I'm going to have to  Wait before I leave  Because they have to  Address all this  At the end of the show  They congregate  By the door  They acquiesce  By the door  And we have to  Try to leave  Yeah  And get through them  Run through them  Oh I beat  It's like a rugby match  I beat the shit out of him  About that email  About me being sick 
[01:11:30]  Oh yeah  Oh how did that go  Oh did I give him  A talking to  And who was to blame  I was legitimately sick  And they're sending emails  To you know  Our agent  Going you know  We're wondering  When he's coming back  To work  But was it  Were they annoyed at it  Or just asking  I let everyone  Knew that  Needed to know  What  Does that make sense  No  You used five different  Tenses  I'm going to  Last week  That just threw everybody  Like wait what  I got  I let people know 
[01:12:00]  I wasn't going to be here  Right  And it was a day by  It was a day to day thing  With me  Yes  Because one day  I was actually in the car  Coming in  And Kenny goes  Holy shit  You don't look well at all  I go you know what  You're right  Turn this fucking car around  And that's when  I had to let you guys know  Last minute  I wasn't coming in  On Wednesday  Kenny  Do you really think  You should be telling  The talent not to go to work  Yeah why didn't you  Tell E-Rock to tell him  Yeah  I think E-Rock  Should only be able  To talk to Opie  From now on  Kenny can no longer  Interact with the show staff  But I told him  It was  I told him it was  A dick move  Fucking sending the email 
[01:12:30]  It really is  I go are you kidding me  You know how many  Fucking live shows  We do for this place  I've gone through that  So many times  With them fucking  Just the calls  And Bob  Ah Anthony  Oh boy  Really  I'm getting emails  What's going on  I have to explain myself  Am I five  Bob just plays into  Their bullshit  Instead of being  A fucking hammer  God is he the worst  He's the worst  The wet noodle  Instead of  I  The wet kugel 
[01:13:00]  Instead of Bob  Instead of Bob going  You know hammering  These guys going  A  You know these guys  Barely take days off  The amount of live shows  Again blah blah blah  He forwards the email  And goes  Oh this is what  They sent me  This is what they sent  This is what they sent  How about you send  Something that says  Go fuck yourself  Yeah how about you  Fucking hammer them  Yeah  What's wrong with you  What was their excuse  For that email  Whoever you spoke to  What did they say  To deflect any blame 
[01:13:30]  We just you know  Just wanted to know  And wanted to make sure  Everyone else knew  It's not fair to the guys  And I'm like  Ant and everyone knew  You know what  I  Who gives a shit  I mean  I can't plan my sick days  Right  This is what happened  I went to sleep  Sunday night  Feeling a little  Like a slight  Kind of dry  Throat thing  By the time I woke up  In the morning  I was  I couldn't even get out of bed  I was so fucking sick  So what am I supposed to do  It's going to be  A last minute call in  Of course  I can't plan to go 
[01:14:00]  You know what  I think I'm going to be  Sick this Thursday  I want to let everyone know  You're not sick very often  Sickness shit  Is literally last minute  Right  Yeah  Wow  It's not fair to the people  That do the show  Who said that  Everyone needs to know  When you're going to be out  It's not a fair  Unfair thing  It's you're sick  You're sick  It's just what it is  That's how it should work  With personal days I guess  You should know  Yeah  I have to let them know  When I'm traveling  But I normally know in advance  God damn motherfuckers 
[01:14:30]  E-Rock please quit  As the supervisor of the interns  It'll make my morning  E-Rock's a water swimmer  Take a stand man  Stop being a chick  Take a stand man  Someone's got to do this  Then why should it be you  You don't have to be the someone  Nice martyr  A faded burgundy shirt  Martyrdom  The bosses come in  What is that  And they start  They start bothering you  Every single Friday  They're busting your balls  They're trying to figure out  What's going to be on the count there  They're trying to give you more work  I wonder who goes into their office 
[01:15:00]  And say hey  Have you talked to Eric  About what's going on  This weekend  Or Len Leland's  Busting his hump  Yeah  It's about time you stood up for yourself  And they'll respect you for it  God  E-Rock man  We got to be a man  We would respect you so much more  If you just did the right thing  Yeah  Why would you take their shit for free  They offered me the position  I turned it down  You did  That's right  You actually  I don't think that's correct  How is he able to turn it down  I don't think he's correct  I don't either  That's right  I turned it down  You should do 
[01:15:30]  Yes I did  Good for you Sam  You should do the same  That's what a man does  Exactly  You want to walk in here every day  And supervise the interns  When they go on mic  No  You shouldn't be doing that  Have some pride  Have some god damn pride  Have some pride  This is not what your specialty is anyway  Come on E-Rock  It doesn't affect the rest of your job  You know that  Let's go  Let's do this right now  And you're very well paid  Things are going okay with this right now  Overpaid  I'm going to keep an eye on him  Oh what a pussy  Jesus 
[01:16:00]  You deserve everything we throw at you  Everything  You just do  You're welcome  He loves being the martyr  E-Rock loves suffering  He loves when everyone knows he's suffering  And you know what  He also loves the ability to be able to say  Well I didn't ask to do this  Right  Yes  You know  That is correct  I didn't ask  Someone had to take the job  Did you post your falling down video yet?  Oh no  I can do that though  You're the Jesus of the interns  You are 
[01:16:30]  Yeah  Self-sacrifice  You know what happened to him right?  That's right  He died for the interns  Immortalized  Died  Oh I have to think of Last Supper  Sorry  Now  What's the falling down video?  At the  At the state fair  I was going down the big fucking slide with the potato sack  Oh no  For the first time  So I was trying to get video  And E-Rock was so excited  My kid's jumping up and down after he did it  Because he's like  Holy shit that was fucking amazing  Because to his dumb two year old mind 
[01:17:00]  He couldn't wrap his head around it  So we were trying to film it  And E-Rock got so excited  He was running toward where my kid was  And tripped over a huge hose  Cable  Cable  It was electrical cable  And literally did a 360 in the air  And landed on his back  What?  As the video's rolling  He took a bump  I don't know  It was a wrestling move  I don't know if the video does it justice  But  You just  Everyone was howling  I have the camera live  And you see the camera flipping over  And everything  As I'm hitting the concrete  And you hear  I gotta see this 
[01:17:30]  I wanna see that right now  I don't know  I gotta see this  Where is it?  Everyone around that particular ride  Besides the people we were with  Were howling  They thought it was part of the act  Right  Dinka dinka  We just saw him  He was so fine  When he was walking slowly  Around the parking lot  He's scared  Did your back hurt  From all the rides  You gave up over the weekend  You guys are confusing him  With a giant big fat elephant  A pachyderm  Okay  I'll put it in the middle of you 
[01:18:00]  Oh thank you  Yay  Put some audio for the listeners too  Yeah  So my kid's coming down the slide  That thing really did flip around  Didn't it?  That's like someone threw the phone  Were you alright?  Yeah  My arm went right into the  I guess  You know  Those cattle fencing  That they have  To separate the people  Yeah  So I hit that  And then flipped over 
[01:18:30]  And then landed on my back  On the concrete  And a cowboy  Tied your legs together  That's a bruise from it  That's from hitting the metal  Wow  That's a pretty good bruise  Right there  Yeah  Yeah  Damn  The interns can't possibly  Be expected to take him  Seriously after that  Interns  Do you take G-Rock seriously?  Yeah  Oh  Look at him  Yeah  Yeah  And Sal is coming  I mean Sal  Sal doesn't take him seriously  Intern  Were you coddled your whole life?  No  Oh it's obvious he was 
[01:19:00]  Oh my god  Did you always get a trophy?  No  Are you one of the trophy kids  Where everyone gets a trophy?  No I hated that  Were you bullied?  You know what he said  You know what he said to me this morning?  And this is evidence of coddling?  Sam good morning  Happy half Christmas  It's just because I want to wish  Half Christmas to everyone  I said it to everybody this morning  What does that mean?  It's June  My favorite holiday  June 25th  Today's your favorite holiday?  Yeah  The half Christmas thing?  Where nothing happens  And you don't get anything  I don't get it  Do people celebrate half Christmas?  No  You just make your own rules  Do whatever you want

The kid's not in his right mind  Yeah  He's you know medicated  Are you medicated?  Not right now  Oh shit you medicated huh?  What do you got?  Adderall  Adderall  You're an Adderall kid  What does that help with? 
[01:21:00]  ADD  Oh everyone's got ADD  Every fucking kid's got ADD  Now um  All of us  Oh boy growing up  Imagine the fucking  The hardship we had  Not being diagnosed with ADD  Until it came out  That this is something  So what are the rules do you make up?  As you go along  Of life  We just  Who picks these weirdos  Of life or of half Christmas  Of both  They don't let me do it anymore  I don't really make up any rules of life  How about for half Christmas?  Half Christmas  How are you doing this with a deficit of attention right now?  How are you even doing this? 
[01:21:30]  How are you talking to us?  What?  How are you paying attention?  What?  This is crazy  Don't you need medicine?  Uh  No um  I could function without it  It's just  Not as  Well  Like I get confused  If too many people start talking  Like Sam's trying to make  You know what you do?  You fucking  Uh  Yeah what are the rules you make up?  Um  We  Make a lot of food  Like kind of like Thanksgiving  And  We  Who's we?  Me and my friends 
[01:22:00]  What were you asking?  You were asking  So why don't we interrupt you?  No I'm fine  I have ADD  It's really not  So Thanksgiving  What are the rules for that?  For Thanksgiving  Yeah  Eat turkey and watch football  Oh  And what about  Half Christmas?  Half Christmas  You do whatever you want  For Thanksgiving?  But what are you going to do?  If you could do whatever you want  Yeah  I'm going to eat a lot  It's happening today  So what are you going to do?  You should really leave that  To when you're five years old  Or something  And you just forget about half Christmas 
[01:22:30]  It's ridiculous  They're talking to you  What?  Pay attention to answer  Oh man  Forget it  What happened?  Oh he's just got the ADD  Sam's trying to tell me something  I have no idea what he's talking about  But we're telling you something on the air  So it's more important  Yeah of course  I wish you had the A-I-D-S  So what are the half Christmas rules?  It's whatever you want it to be  My half Christmas rules  Is you just eat a lot  Hang out with your friends  And just go 
[01:23:00]  Adventure  Adventure  We just walk around town  Doing nothing  Because we're all broke  What do you mean adventure?  What kind of adventuring do you do?  We just walk to different places  And try to do stuff  That doesn't require any money  Okay  So what's an example  Of your adventuring?  Right  Go to the park  Go on the swings  That's it  That's adventuring?  That's my adventuring  Because it doesn't cost anything  Wow  Swings suck  Yeah  Neither does committing a murder  That's adventurous  Yeah  Flashing your dick to a stranger 
[01:23:30]  That's adventurous  Sure  Going on the swings  With your friends  Eric you better be making sure  That your interns  Are not getting pushed  To do things  That they shouldn't be doing  That's right  Nobody's pushing to do anything  He just said he might  Show his dick out in public  I did say the D word  Yeah  If he goes outside  He can do it  But he's not doing it here  No you can't do it outside  That's not good  That's illegal  Are we doing well  It's not my responsibility  You're pushing him  To do illegal things  Are we doing well with the intern?  With him?  Yeah we're well within our boundaries  So far 
[01:24:00]  Eric it's causation  If it was mentioned in here  Then he does it  Uh oh  Yeah  But he's doing it  He doesn't have his own free will  No one's telling him to do it  Causation  Wait you had to learn shit  No I didn't  I was actually giving you  Examples of things  Hold on  You had to learn shit  For this position  That you're not getting paid for?  I had to pick up things  As I went  You're crazy  See  Will you quit as the supervisor?  Just drop the job  There's always new rules  You have to learn shit?  Nah  From time to time  But it's on a situation  To situation basis 
[01:24:30]  And they actually sit you down?  Uh  I don't get to sit down  But um  Sometimes you do  There's a brief discussion  Over new things  That pop up  Will they discuss this segment?  Um  And what you could have done better?  I don't think so  There's nothing  Oh my god  He talks a big game  But Eric's very scared  Of the management  Yeah you are  Very scared  You really are  Just quit  Terrified  Not the show  Just the supervising position  Let them figure it out  Because we don't need interns  In the end  That's right 
[01:25:00]  We'll just take turns  Getting our old fucking coffee  We've done it  We did it for quite a while  Without interns  Yeah  A set of tits on that fucking  The only reason we wanted interns  Was so we could do  Crazy shit with them  Yeah you can't do that  And we're not allowed  To do anything with them  So why are they even here?  No offense to the intern over there  No problem  It's not your fault  I'm sure you would have  Taken a nice kick to the balls  Or something if we asked  Gladly  See?  I know  Mm-hmm  Oh  All right  What are you doing today by the way? 
[01:25:30]  What's your gig?  Here as intern today  What's your duties for the day?  I have to go listen to  More Worst of  For what?  Typing  Like writing descriptions  Of it in Excel  And then I have to go  Answer phones  What is Excel?  The Microsoft program  Every shirt you have  He wishes  He wishes  All right  He wishes  Oh  Iraq  What color is that shirt? 
[01:26:00]  That shirt  Bugs me  It really is a bad one  It looks like a brick  Oh it's just  Terrible  This is really bothering you  You just quit man  Like  Fucking show some pride  Why would you take on  More responsibilities  For this place  And not get paid  I don't  I don't get that  It's performance punishment  There was a time  By the way  And the reason I say that  There was a time  In pretty much  You know  Whatever you do  For a living  You would do some extra shit 
[01:26:30]  That would lead to something  Right  But it doesn't happen anymore  No no  So why would you do that  To yourself?  Yeah you think  Being a go getter  And yeah I'll do it  It would get you  To the next level  And it used to  In radio certainly  And I'm sure  In a lot of businesses  Out there  In the workplace  In the workplace  The workplace  That's not the case anymore  So why would you just do that?  The problem is  You could be severely punished  If something goes wrong  With the interns  But if everything goes right  You won't be rewarded  What exactly  Is it you do here?  That is true  You know 
[01:27:00]  That is so true  This can reward  You're really putting yourself  In a position  Where you could actually  Get fired  For not doing  This free job properly  Free job  And you're never  You're not going to get rewarded  In addition to your already  Lengthy list of duties  You've got so much going on  That you do mediocrely  That you yeah  That you barely do anyway  According to Troy  That makes me laugh  Do you delegate  A lot of responsibility?  Are you the delegate guy  Instead of doing it?  Oh man  Sal's in there going 
[01:27:30]  Yep  That's what he does  Sal  Sal knows  Sal is he a delegator?  Oh yeah  Sal's whole job is Eroch's  Oh man  Delegation boy  That's why he was hired  Are you the closer?  Sal's the closer  Yeah  Comes out of the bullpen  To mop up Eroch's shit  Yeah  Sal's coming out here  He's going to have to  Close out this inning  Bases loaded  Runners in scoring position  He's going to have to  Clean up his mess 
[01:28:00]  Come on Eroch  That's what you do  Sal's the wolf  Yeah don't put Sal  In charge of the interns  He can handle it  No no no  I would love for Sal  To be in charge of the interns  Oh make it happen then  Big talker  Make it so  Yeah Sal's on staff  Yeah  Oh that's true  Yeah big talker  You're all that's left  Eroch  What do you think's going to happen  If you quit?  I don't think anything's going to happen  Then do it  You don't want to do that shit  Yeah you keep saying  You don't want to do it  I think Eroch likes it  I like it  He loves it  He likes being the go to guy  He loves  He likes hearing Eroch 
[01:28:30]  Eric what should I do  Well  Let me think about that a moment  Eric loves being needed  When you see that new group of interns come in  And they're following Eroch like puppies  And Eroch just like  I think he really enjoys that  Come this way  He's like the fucking  He's like they just stepped off that bus in Paris Island  And he's the fucking drill instructor  It takes three weeks before we've got them all turned against him anyway  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Do you guys talk about Eroch behind his back?  You can't get fired so  What? 
[01:29:00]  You have more power around here than we do  Trust me  They protect you guys way more than they protect guys that actually do radio shows  Oh yeah  What do you want to do?  You want to do radio?  I heard you don't want to do radio  I want to be a music jack  What?  Why?  I like playing music  That's a dying art thing  I know right?  Could you pick a more obscure profession?  That's great  Yeah  I want to work a cotton gin  Yeah  What else do you want to do?  Sell TV antennas?  Yeah  There's a better chance that dinosaurs are going to come back 
[01:29:30]  Yeah  That is the worst fucking  That's what I want to be  That's not what I'm  Brontosaurus  God bless you for wanting that  But that is dead  Yeah  In the water  Dead is dead  You could do that now  Someone has to pick the music right?  Yeah computers  Computers pick the music  But someone has to run the computer  No  Not really  Not at this point  Let it roll  Shuffle  Fine my dream is just going to die then  That's your dream?  You could do that now though  For your house  You could podcast  Yeah  Spotify  So you're doing this to 
[01:30:00]  Learn how to be a music jack?  No I'm doing this just because  I like the show a lot  Do you know how to talk up records?  What?

Because I thought  The whole purpose of this 
[01:34:00]  Was to say  The song that came after  Like to say  No  I thought you said  Spide the song was over  Oh my god  You're a music jock  You got Even Flow  So what are you gonna do with it?  You can do whatever  The fuck you want with it  You're talking it up  Into the song  Not out of the song  You got it?  You ever hear this before?  And then we'll do  When it fades out as well  Yeah but like  I don't know  I can't really think of anything  To say  But you're a music jock  To talk that up  That's original  Because everyone knows it  Well you gotta  That's the beauty  That's the beauty  Of being a music jock  You gotta come up  With something else 
[01:34:30]  Yeah  Uncle Kevi wants to hear  What do you want to hear  Uncle Kevi?  Uncle Kevi  Go ahead  Play what?  He almost had something  Uncle Kevi  Play anything by Against Me  By who?

He's pissing me off  This is why it's a dying art form  Dying art form  It was a dying art form  When we went to N.A.W.  Over ten years ago  When you listen to the radio  And you're listening to somebody start a song 
[01:40:00]  A jock start a song  Do you just hear them out of nowhere  Just start going  This person wrote this song  No  You introduce yourself  You can only talk once every  I think four hours  So  Hey everybody  Right  This is your big moment  You gotta shove a lot of shit in  Uncle Kevi with ya  Uncle Kevi  I fucking love being here  It's half a fucking Christmas  I'm gonna be on the swing sets later  With my friends  We're gonna be blowing each other  Adventuring  Adventuring  Yes  Because I have no money 
[01:40:30]  Whatever  Yes  Experimenting with bisexual sex  Right  We're gonna be crushing our Adderall  And storing that shit  Oh yeah  See  There's so much you can do  Let's do something here  Be a shark talk  Yeah  I'm Uncle Chippy  Alright  We'll get to Uncle Chippy in a second  Uncle Kevi  You ready?  Yeah yeah  You ready?  You pumped?  I'm ready  I'm ready  I want to see you succeed  Alright alright  I got it  I really do  But you're frustrating  Alright let's go Sal  You're listening to Uncle Kevi 
[01:41:00]  On WSOU  Now here is  Time to get a spy against me  What happened to Half a Christmas  And all that other stuff?  Merry Half a Christmas to everybody  I didn't want to steal all your guys' stuff  We don't give a fuck  Take our stuff and make it your own  Oh my god  How long is the intro to this song Sal?  Seems like you might have some time there  Yeah  He's got plenty of time  You could do a time in 10  You have plenty of time  Come on  Half a Christmas  What's the matter with you?  Ready?  Can we punch you in the arm?  Yeah sure 
[01:41:30]  Oh boy  Oh E-Rock  Just tested E-Rock  Yeah yeah  You quit you idiot  E-Rock stepped right up  E-Rock's like fucking  He just almost got fired  A bodyguard  Instead he's not going to get rewarded  Yeah because if I now get up  And punch him in the arm  They'll fire you  E-Rock's the bodyguard  Like from your whole gig E-Rock  Yeah  Why would you take that chance?  That's a good one  Alright Uncle Kevi  You ready?  After Christmas  Okay  Uncle Kevi  Talk  Your old pal Uncle Kevi  Right  Talk for a little while  Talk for a little while 
[01:42:00]  Okay  Yeah Uncle Kevi  You can do it  I'm afraid I'm going to hit the post  And I'm just trying not to  How many seconds is the intro?  I'd have to listen to it  Come on more Uncle Kevi  That's what we want  Yeah  Well I'm thinking because you know  Usually if you're a music jock  You write down how many seconds you got  And then you watch the clock  And you do the whole thing  Uncle Kevi rules  Hate Uncle Kevi  Kevi's lame  Alright Sal's back  He's got 18 seconds  18 seconds  I'll even try to help you here 
[01:42:30]  Ready?  Okay  Alright you gotta start  Ready Sal  And go  Merry half Christmas everybody  This is Uncle Kevi  On WSOU  You're now listening to Laura Jane Grayson  Against Me  With Pints of Guinness  Off of  Reinventing Axl Rose  I like the song though  More of this Irish fucking rock drivel 
[01:43:00]  Just this song  Against Me really isn't like  A Dropkick Murphys type band  But  They sound like Dropkick Murphys  It's just the  I'm behind my music  That sounds a little like dumb  Yeah  Holy god  What's your name for real?  Is it Kevin?  Yeah  See more of a behind the scenes type of guy  Oh man  Way behind the scenes  He's got a powerful radio voice  If the radio thing doesn't work  What are you gonna do?  Um  Psychology 
[01:43:30]  I just wanna  I wanna earn money  To open a  I wanna open a bar for local bands  That's like what I wanna do  What do you wanna call it like Uncle Kevi's place?  Yeah why not?  Open a bar for local bands  Alright he's got dreams  That's good  What a fucking  No win scenario that is  I'm trying to stay positive  Just call it the Kobayashi Maru  It's not really  I don't know  I just wanna  Be able to help  And support like local music  So your aspirations are  To either be a music jock  Or open up a bar for local bands  The music jock thing  Would just be to pay for 
[01:44:00]  The bar thing  It's not gonna pay anything  I know  It's not  It'll pay anybody  Like I need a job  In order to get money  For it anyway  So  Radio doesn't pay anyone anymore  Really?  You're fucked too Sam  You know that though  Unfortunately  At least he identifies it  This guy's actually got dreams  Holy shit  Good luck  Are we done with Uncle Kevi  Or do you want one more try  Uncle Kevi?  He did better in the end  Yeah  He missed the post 
[01:44:30]  He fucking just dropped off  I mean part of that  Halfway through his intro  In the song  He mumbled  I fucked that up  Would you say that  Would you say that  Live on the air?  I'm better on my show  Huh?  I'm better when I'm DJing for SOU  Alright bring in an air check  Alright  I challenge you  So you really save the good stuff  For when no one's listening  As opposed to  I save the good stuff  When you have a giant audience  Right now  Are you yelling at me?  No  I'm not yelling at me  Uncle Kevi really put  Fucking Anthony in her place  You rock  Alright turn around then  Keep your fucking interns in line  Yeah really 
[01:45:00]  Turn around so you don't see our faces  And do it  Let's one more try  And then we'll go to break  Have some power behind us  Some passion  Yeah  You know  Get the voice a little lower  You rock's helpful  Talk from down over here  You rock jump up and move that mic  I see that  Alright now he's turned around  There'll be no reward for that by the way  Uncle Kevi or something  Can he give him a wedgie?  Can he give him a wedgie?  He's not allowed to touch him  Oh he's not allowed to touch him  There goes you rock again  You rock just steps him away  You rock the buzz kill  You rock is like that little Asian guy  Chinese guy in front of the tank  Just stopping anything bad 
[01:45:30]  Yeah yeah  Anything that could be fun  For the listeners  Alright ready Uncle Kevi?  Yeah  Hit it out of the park please  Okay  Merry half Christmas everybody  This is Uncle Kevi on WSOU  New Jersey's loudest rock  And this is Against Me  With Pints of Guinness  Off of Reinventing Axl Rose  With their front man or woman  Laura Jane Grace  I missed the post

[01:46:30]  No I'm on radio  In this fantasy world  Is this annoying  Fucking radio show  That you're doing  Is this annoying  He's already delegated away  Part of his job  In this fake fantasy  I want you to get to  18 seconds  You got the clock in front of you  So as soon as Sal starts the music  You know you got 18  Let's do this  Let's hit the post  People are saying  Uncle Kevi blows  Are you ready  I think Uncle Kevi's alright  Ready  Go  Merry Christmas everybody  This is WSOU  It's a half a Christmas

[01:48:00]  I'd like to hit him with a post  And the music starts  And he couldn't have even  Hey Jimmy  What if you said  It's my favorite holiday  Because I made it up  And that's just a little cute thing  That fills two seconds  That's right  That makes Uncle Kevi endearing  Come on  He's like my Uncle Kevi  Who makes things up  Right  Like he was washing me  He says my Uncle Kevi  And if you're going to say  It's half of Christmas  Maybe explain what that means  Like what do you do with it  I think it should be pointed out 
[01:48:30]  That the radio station  That he works for  Is one of the best  College radio stations  In the country  Is it really?  Yeah  Who works there?  Seton Hall  WSOU  It's consistently ranked  Either the best  Is that where what's his name  Worked before we passed on  I love the SOU  That's great  Was that Pete Fornitel's place?  I don't know  It might be  Did Fornitel work there?  Pete Fornitel  I never heard of him  You never heard of  Pete Fornitel  Who was a music jock  You don't really care  About radio  The guy really does  He's not a student of it  How about Pete Fornitel 
[01:49:00]  If you want to be  A music jock  You probably should know  Pete Fornitel  He kind of did a lot with it  He did a lot with  Yeah  Do you know who  Cousin Brucey is?  I've heard of him, yeah  What have you heard  About him?  What do you know  About Cousin Brucey?  Go  Are you learning  This business at all?  Not really yet  Seton Hall is making us  Do all religion crap  What?  It's religious  Catholic school I guess, right?  They just shove religion  Down our throat  For the first two years  And then we get to  The actual major  Do other stuff? 
[01:49:30]  Oh, that's great  What is Cousin Brucey?  What is he about?  Isn't he a classic rock DJ?  Isn't he?  Isn't he?  Wow  He was basically  At the airport  When the Beatles landed  Wow  Right?  Wasn't he one of those guys?  Yes  Air traffic control guy  How do you not know who he is?  Why wouldn't you?  Ah, whatever  Pete was at Fordham University  Just saying  Yeah  Or I wasn't sure  You want to try this 
[01:50:00]  One last time?  Not really  Well, fucking do it  How about you just do it?  Just do it  And make us look like  And make us look like idiots  Ready?  Go, Sal  Merry half Christmas everybody  This is Uncle Petty  And this is my favorite holiday  Because I can do whatever I want  And you are listening to  Against Me  Pints of Guinness  Off of Reinventing Axl Rose  With their front woman  Laura Jane Grace  Only on the loudest rock  W-S-O-U  Oh, Jesus Christ 
[01:50:30]  And he slowed down  At the end  Oh, he slowed down  You had it  You had it  You had it  You slowed down  Right when you needed to  Stank  Fucking punch it  Does he stank  Why would you slow down?  You had it  Because all the other times  I was short  So I figured if I slowed down  It's 18 seconds  But you added in something  Right  And you slowed down  When you had it  And then you slowed down  Oh, Uncle Kevvy  Wow  Alright, well  I guess that's as good  As it's gonna get  Uncle Kevvy 
[01:51:00]  And Uncle Kevvy  Old Uncle Kevvy  He'll tell you what to do  Yeah  I'll bring the bullets  Because I'm a sheriff  I'm Uncle Kevvy  Oh, jeez  Hear that laugh  Yeah  Alright, Uncle Kevvy  That was great  Go do the rest of your duties  Oh, look  Iraq's shadowing you  It's a giant shadow  Iraq, we did good  Anything we could do differently  He stepped on his eclipse, Joe  Oh, that's okay 
[01:51:30]  Anything we could do differently  Nope  That's all within proper guidelines  Of dealing with the interns  Holy shit  Do you have to write this down anywhere  Do you have to make out a report  You do realize that  Pat Duffy brushed his teeth  With dog shit  Dog shit  Yeah  And I miss those days  And now there's a supervisor  Cream Pie Jones  Fucking picked  Jimmy's shit up  Out of a toilet  In his bare hand  It was my duty, Anthony  Jared Fishman  It was Jimmy's duty  Jared  I didn't say his name  Does he hate that?  Oh, right, right  Yeah, Jared Fishman hates it  You're such a subbag 
[01:52:00]  When his internship is brought up  He does not like  The fact that he did duty hat  Can I tell you something real quick  Before we break  Is that his name?  I didn't even know his name  Jared Fishman, yeah  I guess he's trying to start  An iced tea company  It's like  I think it's called  My tea something  My tea beverage or something  Did you make a mistake  And call it  Thank you  He goes  Ice  Yeah  Didn't Conan do an ice cube joke?  Anyone else get that?  Yes  What was it?  No, he was just talking to him  About  Ice tea was saying  How much he hates it 
[01:52:30]  When people confuse him  With ice cube  Oh, shit  He said that?  Yeah  But Jared Fishman  Cream Pie Jones  Yes  He goes  You know  I really think you guys  Would like this tea  He was texting me  And I go  That's fine  Why don't you send us  Some of your  My tea beverage  Or whatever it is  And he goes  Okay, I will  And he goes  You know  It's a Long Island company  I figured it only makes sense  That Opie and Anthony  Would be spokespeople for it  And I go  You'd probably have to pay them  Yeah  And that was the end  Of the conversation  It doesn't make sense  Well, why doesn't he send it?  This could be the fucking 
[01:53:00]  Next Snapple  How about he sends his stuff  Just because he's a duty  Holding young fellow  Doesn't mean he's not  An iced tea god  I don't want iced tea  From duty hands  I wouldn't mind  Maybe that's what makes  The crystals so good  Anyone try the iced tea?  It's not here yet  Send some iced tea  Dumbbell will drink it  I'll drink it and go  Hey, this is great iced tea  What is he going to do  Different with iced tea?  I don't know  What could you possibly do  Different with  He's going to put bath salts in  And so we start biting each other  All right, there you go 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, what hasn't been done  To iced tea at this point  From Snapple  And various other  Iced tea things  They've mixed it with everything  Iced tea with a little grass  Like so it's healthy  With a duty hat lid  He doesn't want that product  Oh, please  Watch he becomes a billionaire  I know  That's what I'm saying  You never know  You could be the spokesman  You never know  Oh, could you see him  Like he's on one of these  Fucking CNBC stock shows  Talking about his company  And they play the video  Of Duty Hatch  Oh, we found something 
[01:54:00]  From your past  After he makes it  And then the stock plummets  Imagine a video  Of Bill Gates  Putting on his shit hat  In a radio station  He finally makes it  One of the top seat  Top fucking business owners  In the world  Yeah  I actually asked him  It was his birthday last week  And I asked him  If his shareholders knew  What he had done in his past  And he said no  Oh, man  Yeah, shareholders  Or potential shareholders  It's probably him and his friend  Yeah  Oh, I'm sure  It's like fucking 
[01:54:30]  Like Ralph and Norton  Yeah  What's it  You re-re-re-invest  In the company  It definitely is  Because when you call  His personal cell phone number  He picks up  He goes  My tea beverage  My tea  So it's my tea  Right  But it's mighty  Right  Oh, I like the name  Very clever  But he obviously puts  His own cell phone number down  Like do tea  And dooty  He obviously puts  His personal cell phone number down  As if it's a business phone  In their office  Right  Vandley Industries  Right  And you want to be 
[01:55:00]  My tea salesman  Well, why can't we get the tea?  I don't know  Check out his iced tea  We haven't gotten any yet  Hopefully he's listening  How about he comes in  And has a whole demonstration for us  That'd be nice  A pitch  A pitch  And he can plug the stuff  All he wants, right?  Right  Here's the deal  Tell him, look  Get him in here  We want to make good  As far as the duty hat goes  Come in and give us a pitch  On the new product  And maybe we can help him  Will you  If he does a good job pitching  Be spokespeople?  Absolutely  Okay  For money, sure  Absolutely 
[01:55:30]  Tell him to make good  He has a chance to, you know  Really impress us  Yeah, I'm bringing his tea  Yep  Let's do that soon  Okay  Alright  Can we finally break?  I'm going to pee myself  Yeah, I have to say  I have an announcement  Oh, you know  Today at 11.15 a.m.  I'm doing my Reddit AMA  People have been asking me to do it  So I'm finally doing it  So you go on Reddit  And you answer it  Ask me anything it's called  Yes  Nice  That's a pretty big site  So  Pretty big, it's huge  11.15 a.m.  On the East Coast

To drain it out every once in a while  Drain out that fucking fluid flood  He was a good kid 
[01:57:30]  He was a good kid  And something might have happened  He might have  Oh boy  He might have crashed his car  And he might not be around anymore  Oh boy  Yeah  But she grew up in the neighborhood  Jeez  Went out to L.A.  And married Alex Trebek  She was a very, very nice girl  I knew her as a girl  Oh, that's fantastic  She's a grown woman now  Anyway  Iroch did not quit  No, no  He loves it

I don't want to be broken  Hmm  I don't  Everyone's broke around here  I'm trying not to be broken  Yeah, but where does it come from  That you want to help everybody  Oh, the floor is under you  You want to help everyone  And you want to bring everyone up around you  What's that based on?  I don't know  I mean, people in general do that  But you want to do it to pretty much every person you see  What's wrong with that?  It's a little weird 
[01:59:00]  Power of positive thinking  No, but it's too much, though, with you  It's throwing out cliches  Exactly  What do you know about the power of positive thinking?  What was in your upbringing that caused  HIV?  That caused you to be like this?  We've  My family always did things like this  It was  We  Always  Who was broken in your family  And everyone had to fucking try to bring her up  Everyone in my family was broken  Or him up  I don't know  Yeah  Who was in your family?  Oh 
[01:59:30]  Asshole itches  I don't have a tumor in there  But isn't it the greatest feeling  Oh, God  Isn't it the greatest feeling when you get to the itch, though?  Jesus Christ  Is it wonderful?  And can itch it out?  It's the dirtiest place to itch  I know  You're sniffing your finger  Did you get some on there?  Nah, not really  A teeny bit of ass sweat  But nothing much  You guys get the athlete's feet there?  No  I get it  And when you have to itch that shit  There's not a better feeling in this world  And you'll fucking itch until all your skin is gone 
[02:00:00]  Oh, dude  Oh, but it is the best itch you'll ever have in your life  I can't explain it  And then you got this gnarly  Oh, there you go  Then you got the fucking, you know, wound that you created  Holy fuck  You've never had athlete's foot to the point  No  And it's under the skin  And none of that powder shit can work  Because it's way past that  So now you've got to itch it out  So you will itch layers of skin away?  No  Oh, it's the best itch ever  No, I will tell you what the best itch ever 
[02:00:30]  Thumb, forefinger, on the scrotum  Gently twirl  Like, oh, oh  And you have to go  Hoot-lee-hoo  Yeah  Hoot-lee-hoo  You just kind of circular motion  Between thumb and forefinger  With your scrot in between  Oh, it feels great  And just going like  Ho, ho, ho  It's like a dog  When you find that good spot  Ah, yeah  You women don't know  Unless you do that with your labia  You think you do?  You twirl your labias?  Do they fucking  Yeah  Roll it between their fingers 
[02:01:00]  When they get a little itchy labe?  I bet you they wrap their pussy lip  Around their knuckle  And just pretend it's like an awful glove  Like a horrible snail glove  Hey, are camel toes in this season?  I'm seeing a lot of fucking camel toes out there  I haven't seen a good one in a while  I've seen a few  Because they've got the pants hiked up a little higher  And the camel toes are on display this season  Dude, I'm telling you, man  The big pussy is dead  It's dead, huh?  You know how long this business  I've fucking even seen one in a good picture?  Like, I want to  I'm single for a year  Congratulations 
[02:01:30]  A year almost  You haven't seen the big fat one?  No  What are they, little fucking bird?  Bird mouth pussies?  Rotten  Rotten to the core  Fucking horrible little pussies  Yuckaroo  Yuckaroo  Terrible  The big vag is dead  I urge you to, like  Not dry your feet off  After you shower for a while  Let that athlete's foot fucking develop  Let it go untreated  And then in the middle of the night  You're going to find yourself with that thumb  Just fucking rubbing and itching 
[02:02:00]  Doesn't the fungus get on your hands then?  I don't know  I guess you're washing hands at the end  But it's a great, great feeling  And you'll itch layers of skin away  Because it feels so good  No  No  See, I scratched a hole in the bottom of my foot  I know they're out there  What's wrong with these people?  I know I'm talking to some people that understand  Maybe it's urine sock that gives it to you  Urines?  That would be underneath, though  Oh, that's true  I don't know, where do you get it?  Just from being 
[02:02:30]  I mean, where do you get it?  What do you mean?  On your foot  In between the toes  Is it?  But then in between the toes  Leading up, up, up the foot a little bit  Up like the top of  Usually between the pinky toe  And the other toe  Whatever you call the toe  Next to the pinky toe  Can't you fix that?  The two spaces all the way to the left  Oh, nice  Yeah, you can fix it with some spray  But sometimes I let it go  Until it gets to that point  So I get that nice itch in  Why do you let it go?  This is beyond me 
[02:03:00]  You've never had athlete's foot?  No  We've had it  You can get tough acting  Tenactin  That's true  I love a good spray  There's nothing better than spraying the itch off your foot  It rules  That's if you get it early  Oh, we gotta get it early?  If you don't get it early  I don't, that, I don't know  Then I just gotta itch  And release it  I think it's under the skin  So you gotta release it  Release it?  Yup  The fuck is going on?  That's great  I don't like the sound of that  Kirk Douglas tells Bill Maher to fuck you 
[02:03:30]  Oh man  Good for him  Tells Bill Maher fuck you  Good for him  This is a clip that's becoming a bit viral today  You wanna see this?  Viral?  Everybody's okay  But I mean, you had to hide  I mean, you know  You were born a Jew  Your parents are from Russia  You couldn't tell people in the 40s and 50s  When you were a movie star  That you were a Jew  It was like being gay then  Do I have a choice? 
[02:04:00]  Pause  A source?  What did he say?  Do I have a choice?  You heard that?  Yeah  I have a source  Oh, okay  Fair enough  I didn't hear a choice  I sound like he has a horse  A source?  Being gay or being Jewish  Oh, a choice  Wow  No, I tell you  I tell you  I think that's too much religion 
[02:04:30]  I think religion has caused so much catastrophe in the world  Well, you're preaching to the choir here  But even the Jewish religion  I think the ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Jews are terrible  Absolutely  You know, every religion has some part of it that doesn't fucking well 
[02:05:00]  So, I think  What did you mean?  What did he say?  But I mean  First of all  That's what I thought you said  But I mean  You changed your name to Kirk Douglas  And no one knew  I mean, you couldn't admit back then that you were Jewish  And  Oh, wait a minute  I've admitted it 
[02:05:30]  Well, not to the public  Oh, no  It's pretty funny  I like the fact that he's doing an interview  He had a stroke, right?  Oh, God  No, that's just the way he talks  He's been like that for years  But that was a stroke, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  That's got to be so frustrating when your faculties are working  And just your mouth won't do what you tell it to  Jesus  He's hard to understand  But I mean, he can  He can pick up some of the stuff  He can communicate, though  Like  Dude, you're looking at a 95-year-old guy  How old is he?  95 
[02:06:00]  And he suffered a stroke  Holy shit, 95?  I believe he's 95  That's insanity right there  Wow  Look him up  Is he 95?  Finish the rest of the clip  Please  To your wife, of course, but  Oh, that was it anyway  Oh, that's it  I think he's 95  Wow  That's good for 95, man  95 years young  That's great for 95  95  What year was he born?  He is 95  95 years old  Kurt Douglas  So, Sandusky found guilty of some things 
[02:06:30]  What?  45 out of 48  What a railroad job  What happened with the other three charges?  He was innocent  Oh  He didn't do nothing  No?  Sure  He did  They said he double parked  He didn't  They accused him of stealing a toaster  There wasn't no proof of that then there, was there?  And he got off of that  Sure he did  What about the ass-fucking of young boys?  I think his lawyer screwed that one up 
[02:07:00]  Ah  Well, that is a  I think he's gonna do three months and get out  That's my prediction  They led him away  He just looked like he was out of it  He knows he's going to jail for the rest of his life  Yeah  I hope he kills himself  And he looked like he knew  I was howling that they put a seatbelt on him  Did you see that part?  I was obsessed with the fact they had to put a seatbelt  Put a seatbelt  Don't want to get hurt on the way to prison for life  Yeah, they put him in the back seat  When you go, look 
[02:07:30]  Really?  A seatbelt?  Yeah  Could you leave it fucking off and hit an abutment?  They just gave him 400 and what was it?  440 years or something  And they're putting a seatbelt on  Did they give him time yet or not yet?  They didn't sentence him yet  They're estimating that it would be  Wow  The equivalent of 440  But he did push-ups last night just so he could live and get out  Oh, yeah, this is not going to be  Can you imagine if he lived?  Like if some weird thing happened  And someday they were like  528 year old Jerry Sandusky 
[02:08:00]  And then the day he gets out  He trips and falls down the steps and dies  Fucking  Yeah  Yeah, he's just done  That's it  That was  They're saying  That they're going to try to appeal it  Based on the lawyer not doing his job  That the fact also that  The trial was too quick  Right  They're saying that it was  Why did he get on the stand?  Much too fast  Fucking scumbag  Supposedly he didn't get on the stand  Because his adopted son was going to testify 
[02:08:30]  And they decided  Well, fuck  There's nothing we can do here  So it would be best not to  Testify  Why doesn't this piece of shit just take his punishment  And fucking go drop dead in jail?  And I think they're going to  I think they're appealing  Because that Amendola  That lawyer there  Loves the attention  You see him smirking  And he's like  Oh, look at all the attention  This is kind of cool  Yeah, they're definitely not  They're going to say  He didn't give him a good enough defense  He actually was being interviewed  By Anderson Cooper on Friday night  And goes to Anderson 
[02:09:00]  Hey Anderson  Something like this  I just want to let you know  I love you  I watch you every night  It's like  Do you understand what's going on?  Yeah  He's all starstruck  He's fucking gushing  Please  He's so hateable  Yeah  So hateable  That lawyer  Do you know who wrote a good article  About this?  Believe it or not  Me?  Mushnick  No, you wrote a great article  Oh, Mushnick  Mushnick  I'm not going to read the whole article  But he said  So what was the final score  In the Jerry Sandusky scandal? 
[02:09:30]  Who won?  The thoughts or the prayers?  Or was it a tie?  And then he goes  Our thoughts and prayers  Go out to the victims  Geez  If I heard that  Issued in countless statements  One more time  I was going to retch  I had no idea  That college football coaches  And athletic directors  Those who knowingly  Recruit high school characters  To their camp  High risk characters  To their campuses  Lest the guys  Recruit them  To their campuses  Were so thoughtful  And prayerful  And it really is 
[02:10:00]  A great point  About how this  Fucking shitty  Penn State  Is doing nothing  But offering  Thoughts and prayers  Thoughts and prayers  And uh  Boy, they know  They're going to pay  A lot of money  Because they're saying  Yes, we're willing  To hear the claims  Thoughts and prayers  To all of them  Thoughts and prayers  The civil lawsuits  Tony Dan's  I have a show anymore  That shouldn't say  I hope it breaks them  I don't necessarily  Want to see that  But  Yeah  Yeah, there's probably  A lot of good  It does this school  It's just that one  Shitty part of it  I don't like Mushnick  By the way  Really? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, I kind of like him  Because he's  Such an idiot  Yeah, but he like  He doesn't hold back  Had that controversy  Recently  And he skated  Because he basically  Said fuck you  You know, this is  My thoughts on  The Brooklyn Nets  Right  Remember he wanted  He said they should  Change their name  To the Brooklyn  Brooklyn, yeah  Oh yeah, Brooklyn  And Vegas, yeah  And uh  He got some shit for that  And he just  He just hung in there, man  He is an idiot, but 
[02:11:00]  I'm glad they didn't  Fire him for it, though  Of course not  It's Anderson  Great  I'm good  To Jason's question  Did Jerry Sandus  That was it  That was it  Try the beginning  What's the matter with you?  Jerry Sandus  Wait, he's  Joe Amendola  Appears on Anderson Cooper  Asks if somebody cute  Will be interviewing him 
[02:11:30]  See, he loves the attention  Come on  Is that what's going on here?  This is Joe Amendola  This is happening live  So we're gonna  We're gonna bring in  Some photographers  To get him  To get him hooked up  How are you, Joe?  No, that's my cheat sheet  That's my cheat sheet  But we're gonna get you  Hooked up now, Joe  You're gonna be on  With Anderson Cooper  Somebody cute  It's Anderson Cooper  Look, he's just  Having a good time  Oh my God  That's just how Joe is  Come on, Anderson  He knows I love you  All right, I'm gonna  Step out of here  And I'm gonna step in  With Anderson Cooper  You'll be live  As we get you hooked up here  You mean I'm not now  But as you're getting 
[02:12:00]  Hooked up here  And just before  You get a chance  To get Anderson  To talk to you  Give us a sense  Of how your client  That's as creepy  As Jerry  That's what I'm saying  Test the sound  Because of all this noise  You hear?  No  Don't hear anything  What a jerk off  This guy is  Joe, it's Anderson Cooper  Can you hear me?  Test  I can, Anderson  How are you?  Joe, it's Anderson  Great, I'm good  To Jason's question  Did Jerry Sandus  Jesus  You know who he is?  He's an ass  He's an ass  He's an ass  Trying to be funny 
[02:12:30]  And off the cuff  Yeah, your fucking client  Is being accused  Of fucking little boys  You idiot  He is a hateable guy  And he's having  A good time  With the whole thing  Yeah  He is hateable  What a tool  So that's where  We're at with Sandusky  Suicide watch  Whatever  Place of  Protective custody  Like we said  Of course  They're gonna protect him  Yeah  No one's gonna be able  To get to Sandusky  Anytime  Paterno 
[02:13:00]  Made a  Paterno family statement  Oh good  Although we understand  The task of healing  Is just beginning  Yeah  Today's verdict  Is an important milestone  The community owes  A measure of gratitude  To the jurors  For their diligent service  Our thoughts and prayers  Continue to be  With the victims  And their families  Can I correct this?  I think there was a typo  Although we understand  The task of healing  Is just beginning  As opposed to  Happening ten years ago 
[02:13:30]  When our father  Was thinking too much  About the football program  And knowingly  Handed it off  To people  Who would do nothing  Today's verdict  Is an important milestone  The community owes  A measure of gratitude  To the jurors  As opposed to  My father  Who did nothing  For their diligent service  Once again  As opposed to  Our father  Who did nothing  Our thoughts and prayers  Continue  Continue to be with  Ourselves and our legacy  And oh yeah  We hope the victims  Assholes are doing okay 
[02:14:00]  Shit heads  You don't like their statement?  I mean I have nothing  Against the family  But it's just  More self-serving garbage  We have been trained  That if you just  Say the right thing publicly  We all know  You're full of shit  And it's okay  Yeah but it's okay  I'm sorry  I did not mean that  Everybody knows you meant it  Everybody knows you meant it  Like Amari was angry  In his tweet  And he called the guy  A faggot  Or a fag  In a DM  Yeah  He was annoyed  And he meant it  Hey man sorry  Didn't mean it  Okay you didn't mean it 
[02:14:30]  Yeah  You know they could try  There's no sincerity  They could try all they want  But Paternal's legacy  Is fucked  And it should be  There's nothing you could do  Dude do you know  Every highlight clip  That had Sandusky in it  Right  Penn State clips  Oh man  Who the fuck's gonna want  To show them for years  Yeah  Because the guy's like  Boy fucker  He's not even a criminal  He's a boy fucker  You can't be showing highlights  You know how many  College athletes  Highlight reels  Are now destroyed  Because this bag of shit's  In the background  Of a great play  That is true 
[02:15:00]  Bag of shit  You know how many people  Can't thank him  That should be our new business  Erasing Sandusky  From highlight reels  Yeah  Oh man  We're adding him to highlight reels  I wish we could find  I wish we could find  Some speeches  Where people thank him  Because you know  That there are some  Oh yeah  Oh that'd be fun  That'd be fun  Some of the victims  Getting back to the  Athlete's foot thing  For just one second  Because I just got a tweet  From Eugene Buckworth  This is what I'm talking about  And I've done this 
[02:15:30]  Many a time  Many a fucking time  Jesus Christ  What the fuck is that  What'd Eugene Buckworth  Write 100 cents  What's the fuck  You're looking at  His middle toe there  On his left foot  It's all bloodied  And he itched the athlete's foot  To the point where now  It's just a big red  I don't know  Size of a dime  That's fucking disgusting  That's taking all the layers  Of skin off  Because you got an athlete's foot  But the itch  Getting to that point  Is amazing 
[02:16:00]  Man  That's all I'm saying  That's terrible  That's all I'm saying  How do you keep getting it  Like why doesn't it just go away  And not come back  Athlete's foot  Yeah  What the fuck is it  Throw some spray on  You got to dry your tootsies  After a shower  Yeah  That's all  Isn't that easy  Yeah I get lazy  Oh jeez  Jesus Christ  I don't have proper foot care  I guess  Jesus of  Oh my god  What are you doing  Jesus  You did that all weekend  All weekend  I was just imitating  Bill Burr 
[02:16:30]  Jesus Christ Joe  Jesus  Jesus  Jesus Joe  What the fuck  You don't have to tell everybody  Jesus  Fucking Hollywood  Anything else on Sandusky  I don't know  It's pretty  It's been fucking  Played out  Yeah  You know  You're definitely right though  Like any  Any Paterno  Like the legacy  Is just gone  I understand you got to try  Because he was a hell of a football coach  But  But that's going to be the biggest thing 
[02:17:00]  That is thought about  When you hear his name  It's not going to be football  And Penn State in general  Yeah Penn State  And although  All these alumni out there  Proud of their school  This is rough  To get past  For a while  Yeah Penn State  Is now known as  You know  The kid toucher school  Right  Yeah the one thing  They were really known for  Yeah  And now that's just wrecked  So I don't know  It's wrecked  But they'll continue to  Defend  Yeah  Well godspeed  Jerry Sandusky 
[02:17:30]  Let me say hi to Tommy  In Brooklyn  Tommy  Hey good morning  Hello  You're on the money Jimmy  Let me tell you  When's the last time  You've seen a clip of OJ  Yeah it's true  I mean you don't see a lot of  Occasionally they'll show them  But it is rare  They edited so much of that shit out  It's not like he did anything  In football right OJ  No no  He did  When you watch football  They always show the greats  Yeah  You know  You know what  Tommy  I don't remember the last time 
[02:18:00]  I saw an OJ clip  Even just on the field  Yeah  They just avoid that shit  That's what I'm saying  Yeah  As far as the college goes  I wonder how they're going to do  With people  You know kids going there  I know my daughter was accepted  And denied going there  She's not going to go  Where Penn State  Yeah  So I wonder how many people  Who do you think they're going to do to her  Why wouldn't you send her  She didn't want to go  She just  You know  No because the reputation now  You get into Penn State  And then you're thinking  You know what  No  So what

[02:36:00]  To put in her vagina  And then he mixed it with his saliva  So nobody would know there was less  Yeah  He was cheating  He just wanted a little bit for himself  The jizz count  Alright  Florida man won't be charged  In a bestiality case  Because of  Superhero  Law loophole  That's Eric's  Superhero identity  Florida man  Florida man  I'm Florida man  There was a law loophole  So they can't charge this guy  With bestiality  What's the loophole? 
[02:36:30]  Florida authorities  Are powerless  To prosecute  A former animal shelter worker  Accused of performing  Sex acts on a dog  Because of a loophole  In the state's  Anti-bestiality laws  Now when they say  Performing sex acts  On a dog  You're thinking  He's blowing the dog  Yeah sucking it's fucking dog dick  God damn  Or is it a girl  He's maybe eating it's dog pussy  A development that has  Outraged animal activists  You think  You think they would be  A little outraged  Why is he licking it's pussy?  Mind your beeswax  You think a dog gives a shit 
[02:37:00]  If you suck it's dick?

[02:37:30]  Oh my god  They're all over the place  Dogs don't have morals  They want their dick sucked  Love his dick sucked  While a sunshine state law  An act of last year  Prohibits bestiality  It doesn't explicitly  Forbid oral sex  With animals  Alright so he had a  As long as you don't  Put your dick in  He knew the law  Oh this is the  Great  Now they're calling  For an amendment  To the law  Basically begging them  To  Who's gonna fight  That one  Begging them  To include  Oh god  This guy's great 
[02:38:00]  Eric Antunes  Looked like he'd be  One of the first people  Prosecuted under the  New law of bestiality  When police discovered  Pictures of him  Engaged in sex acts  With his girlfriend's  Three-legged dog  It was a three-legged dog  He's a 29-year-old  Clearwater resident  They had a tip  He was hoarding  Child porn  Though  They searched  Their cell phone  They found graphic  Pictures of him  Molesting his girlfriend's  Dog  Wow  She's the medical  Director  His girlfriend 
[02:38:30]  Of Piniella's  Piniella County's  Human Society  How  Though she was  Humane  Humane  I'm sorry  That she was unaware  Of what was going on  Oh this is great  She was unaware  That he was sucking  The dog's dick  Or licking his pussy  Oh right  They don't say  What it was  Huh  Oh wow  Let me see  Why wouldn't they say  If it was a female  Or a male dog  Oh he's still facing  Multiple charges  Related to child pornography  Whoopsie  Can this guy just  Jerk off to anything  Normal like people

[02:39:30]  With a 17 year old  Oh god  Yeah  He was fucking her too  He was 32  But there's no problem  With fucking her  It was the pictures  That he took  And I guess  Their logic is this  What kind of pictures  Pictures  Pictures of them fucking  Oh okay  I think their logic is this  If you have sex  With somebody  And it's the age of consent  But not the age of consent  For pictures  It's private  It's a one off  You're in a room somewhere  You're not doing it  In public 
[02:40:00]  And that's it  It can't really affect  Anything in the future  Pictures are forever  So they think  That that's more detrimental  And they think  Young people understand  The implications of sex  More than they do  How the pictures  Can come back to haunt you  That's bullshit  But  Yeah  So he got in trouble  For the pictures  Eight years  But not for the sex  Remember the guy  From Florida  We just talked about  You're on  We got a better  We actually got a better

Do they know she's hard of hearing?  Is that part of why they did it?  Maybe they didn't even hear  Maybe they knew it  And that's why they would say horrible shit  There's no way  After seeing her being interviewed live  With an earpiece in by the way  That she heard these kids  They definitely knew she was deaf  Because they were pointing at her ear  And pointing at her hearing aid 
[02:56:30]  You got a bus filled with kids  So they're all having their conversations  You know  I don't think the whole bus was focused on her  So there's a lot of noise in the bus  Then the bus itself  Then the outside noise  There's no  I'm convinced they did not hear  No  I mean she did not hear them  Or most of what they said  Well  Idiots  I'll call them idiots  They are idiots  Not the kids  I'll call them idiots  The people that have donated money to this woman  Six hundred  You better explain yourself  Five hundred fifty three dollars so far 
[02:57:00]  Wow  That's  Six hundred forty five thousand dollars  She's got  And  If you donated money  To this woman  You're a fucking  Jackass  Why  Does  Being called names  Merit  That kind of money  If you wanted to give money  To something  Why not give to  You know  A little  Cancer kids  Whatever is happening in your life  Find that charity  Or something  And give them money  People so eager  To give money away 
[02:57:30]  But  But  She's up to  Six hundred fifty thousand  Plus the trip to Disney  For her and  What  Nine of her friends  Nine  Fucking friends  That she doesn't have  Is that what Disney is doing  And when is she going to thank the kids  For making her life better  Yep  She wouldn't accept their apologies  But  Oh really  She wants to milk this  Hold on  Let's break this down  Those kids  As horrible as it was  Made her life a lot better  Hmm  So shouldn't she now thank the kids  Yeah she should  Yeah she  Her life is way better  Because of those kids now 
[02:58:00]  And I think in God's eyes  Those kids are now going to heaven  Ah  Cause in the end  They helped the lady  They didn't know  But they were doing it  They didn't know  They were helping the lady  At the time  But in the end  Guess what  This woman's life  Is way better  Because of those kids  She wouldn't accept the apology  I didn't hear that  No then  She did  She knows they're full of shit though  She did accept over the weekend  When I was watching  The early news programs  They were saying  What happened  Cause I guess I'll have to  I guess that's  As good as it's gonna get  So I guess I'll have to accept it 
[02:58:30]  Right  She did say something like that  She was given a trip  To Disneyland  Disneyland in California  Oh really  It's not even Disney World  Three days in Disneyland  See even the Disney people know  Yeah fuck her  Not Florida  She's not good enough  She's a body like Warren Haynes  It's terrible  Can we see some of the interviews  Instead of just sitting there  Having a good time  Listening to this great radio show  Sam  How about some interviews  Stop sitting here  Having a fucking time of your life  We did all the interviews  We'll try  We'll try

[03:02:00]  Why do we turn on these stories  So quickly?  I don't think it's just us either  I think society  You think everybody's  Starting to turn on this  Do we realize what emotional  Idiots we are?  Not just us  I'm saying  Right  Society in general  Does this  You're sick society  You start off with  And then you're like  Yeah same thing happened  To homeless Ted Williams  Yeah  The exact same story  We all lulled him  And then within two weeks  We couldn't stand the guy anymore  What the fuck did that homeless guy  Get to deserve all this  He was a piece of shit  I got you a Louis Vuitton

[03:03:00]  That all these people  Are so nice  A fundraising website  Intended to pay for her  To go on vacation  Has raised more than  Half a million dollars  From people around the world  Money Klein appreciates  But says she doesn't need  Money is money  I can live with it  Or live without it  But it doesn't make you  What?  Really feel any better  About what happened  On that bus  No the emails  I think are the best  But perhaps the most  Important notes  Were apologies  From the four boys
